1
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,660
Hey.

2
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,320
Hey.

3
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,060
Hey.

4
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,300
Hey.

5
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,180
Oh!

6
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,320
Wait, wait.

7
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,880
Jolly!

8
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,220
Ram Raja.

9
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,360
I swear I saw the news.

10
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,880
Wait, what news?

11
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,320
Extremely savage.

12
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,200
Genuinely, I wish you nothing but the best for your future.

13
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,160
The news, of course, that you smell.

14
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,260
Got him.

15
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,120
Stop!

16
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Stop it!

17
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,320
Wait, oh gosh.

18
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,080
There's another super chat.

19
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,580
I'm just gonna scroll up.

20
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,660
Sorry, you're gonna have to listen to it.

21
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,560
I haven't even done my intro!

22
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,720
You guys are sending things!

23
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,840
I haven't even done my intro!

24
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,180
All I said was hey!

25
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,460
Did someone say Devil May Cry 4?

26
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,200
Because that's my thang.

27
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,640
This is your thang then.

28
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,500
This is your thang.

29
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,900
Do I select applicant only for the Aqua Finale International Lottery?

30
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,680
Or one accompanying person and hope to find someone else to come along?

31
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, I think you should try the one accompanying...

32
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Actually, I don't know.

33
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,620
Will you have a better chance of being a solo seat or double seats?

34
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,020
I think you should do the solo.

35
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,980
Fuck Nicholas!

36
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
Anyway, let me do my intro, you guys.

37
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,880
Let me do my intro.

38
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,220
Devil Minky Cry.

39
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,160
Hello, welcome back to Devil May Cry 4.

40
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,510
Wake up block!

41
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,650
Thank you so much for the donation!

42
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
Thank you!

43
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,290
Thank you so much!

44
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

45
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,550
DMC!

46
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,090
DMC, baby!

47
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,330
So, for people watching the VOD, you might be watching the VOD because of the time change.

48
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,190
And if that's the case, thank you for watching the VOD!

49
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,870
I'm sorry about the time change.

50
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,710
I got asked about something tonight.

51
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,830
It was last minute.

52
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,050
It was literally, I think, like the day after I posted my schedule.

53
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,810
And I could not say no.

54
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,590
So, the time has come and so has Minty!

55
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,650
I will not say what it is related to for...

56
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,430
I don't know if it's a surprise or anything.

57
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,430
I've been possessed for three months.

58
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,330
Congrats on headlining Lollapalooza.

59
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,910
I don't even know what that is.

60
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:35,130
Okay, for those who don't know, someone made like an edit of my name on this music festival thing.

61
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,130
The Lollapalooza.

62
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,330
I don't even...

63
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,150
It was Tia, right?

64
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,330
And I saw my name on that and I was like, whoa, what is this?

65
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,350
What did I sign up for?

66
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,090
But I don't...

67
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,250
Lollapalooza.

68
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,810
Can I get a sneak peek of what's happening on Sunday so I can prepare for my FOMO arc?

69
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,350
Watch Mufasa or whatever movie you want on the plane with Power Pro Minto.

70
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,110
I don't get the Minto plush until right after I leave.

71
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,370
No!

72
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,450
Oh, actually, Sunday.

73
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,810
I had an idea for something, but I don't have enough time to do it.

74
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,590
So I'm actually moving it.

75
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,870
Sunday will instead be like 10 hours of dredge.

76
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,890
I hope you guys don't mind.

77
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,230
I had an idea, but things have been like...

78
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,910
Things have been like...

79
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,010
Things last minute.

80
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,470
People contacting me for meetings and things of the such and like.

81
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,290
So I've been like...

82
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,650
And then also other things like taking care...

83
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,930
Like I've been having to go do stuff taking care of my car.

84
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,830
And my sink broke.

85
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,570
With this other stuff that I've had to...

86
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,390
Stuff with my cats I've had to take care of.

87
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,140
So it's just like...

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,540
I've been being pulled every which way.

89
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,520
Yeah, busy busy.

90
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,380
Not just with the stream stuff, but also with other things.

91
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,170
So I've been like...

92
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,540
So much, so much.

93
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,140
I have a favorite shape.

94
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm in love with the shape of you.

95
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,160
Only 10 hours.

96
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,960
She says 10 hours of dredge like it's a bad thing.

97
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,840
Yeah, I'm gonna start early like probably around this time.

98
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,680
And then just play until I can't play no more.

99
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,340
Friendship.

100
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,560
Friend.

101
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,700
Minky never cry.

102
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,000
Minky never cry.

103
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,740
Sorry.

104
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,600
Every time you see this happening, it's me scrolling on...

105
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,760
With my mouse.

106
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,400
Like that.

107
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,400
You've been very mature.

108
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,400
I've been very mature.

109
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,580
Like, like, like a wine.

110
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,740
Mmm, Devil May Scroll.

111
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,900
I too go hoo-ha-hee-ha when things go bad at work.

112
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,100
Are you...

113
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,860
Are you giving birth at work?

114
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh, that's the breathing.

115
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,460
That's the breathing when they say to give birth, no?

116
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,720
What kind of job do you have?

117
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,240
Take care of yourself, boss.

118
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,980
Thank you.

119
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,700
How do you know that?

120
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,920
Is that not just the thing that people say?

121
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,160
Like, when you give birth, go hee-hoo-ha, hee-hoo-ha.

122
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,140
Everyone knows that.

123
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,900
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

124
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,730
Minky bait.

125
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,390
Jason breathing on Friday the 13th.

126
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,410
Ch -ch-ch-ch.

127
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,140
Thank you, thanks for the five gift card.

128
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,760
Thank you.

129
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,380
Sound Jason Voorhees makes.

130
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,100
Is it?

131
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,940
No, he goes...

132
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,970
Why is everyone saying different things?

133
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,410
Some people are saying ki-ki, some people are saying la-la, some people are saying ha-ha.

134
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,390
It's like we're all laughing different ways.

135
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,270
Ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki.

136
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,330
Ha-ha.

137
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,040
Ha-ha.

138
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,820
But

139
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,260
yeah, welcome back to Devil May Cry.

140
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,100
Last time we ended, um, uh, beat the first, uh, beat our first boss.

141
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,600
We beat our first boss.

142
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
Oh, sorry, I thought my cat was in here.

143
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,820
And we, uh, that was it.

144
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,600
Ki-ki or a booba.

145
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,920
Second boss.

146
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,780
What was the first boss?

147
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,600
What's the first boss?

148
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,570
The five...

149
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,950
Oh, right!

150
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,010
Oh my gosh, he was so easy.

151
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,170
I like, totally forgot about that.

152
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,430
I didn't have to use a health or anything on that guy.

153
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,650
I'm just...

154
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,570
Wow, I completely forgot about him!

155
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,370
Oops.

156
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,150
Extra cool.

157
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,330
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

158
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,670
Thank you so much!

159
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,110
Oh, oopsie.

160
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,210
I forgot about him.

161
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,370
Yeah, we beat a second boss.

162
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,910
Oh my gosh!

163
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,870
Wow, and here I was feeling kind of bad.

164
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,990
I was like, man...

165
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,090
I only beat one boss last stream.

166
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,770
Kind of bad.

167
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,870
You use the health thing.

168
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,930
No, I didn't.

169
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,470
No, I didn't.

170
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:51,870
No, I didn't.

171
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,410
No, I didn't.

172
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,250
That's right.

173
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,290
Also, I want to say some stuff.

174
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,670
Because I saw comments of people...

175
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,390
Being like, um...

176
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,890
Hey, Minto, don't feel bad that you don't rev.

177
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,390
Because honestly, um...

178
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,770
It's...

179
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,650
It's, you know, it's good to know.

180
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,730
But...

181
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,390
Um...

182
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,270
That some people, like, didn't really get good at it and stuff.

183
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,250
Until, like, multiple playthroughs.

184
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,390
So...

185
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,630
So, you know, I'll keep trying.

186
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,190
But I'm not gonna beat myself up over not using it.

187
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,050
I'm not gonna...

188
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,470
I'm not gonna beat myself up over using it.

189
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,990
But if you want to remind me...

190
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,830
Just try not to, like, spam remind me.

191
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,810
If you don't mind.

192
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,270
But if you want to be like...

193
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,730
By the way, Minto, you could rev.

194
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,010
Be like, oh yeah.

195
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,810
I could do that sometimes.

196
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,750
But there are some things...

197
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,070
Because there's new controls...

198
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,770
We got the grabby grabs last time too.

199
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,910
That's, like, a core mechanical.

200
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,850
Grabby grab.

201
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:10,330
Um...

202
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,890
And I just kind of have to remember how to combo things.

203
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,910
And I don't remember how to fight.

204
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,410
I'm gonna have to remember how to fight.

205
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,390
Oh, ow.

206
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,070
You can press Alt F4 to beat the game immediately.

207
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh my gosh.

208
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,910
You're so right.

209
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,690
Secret codes.

210
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,070
That's the Capcom code.

211
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,030
You know how there's the Konami code?

212
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,650
The Capcom code is Alt F4 on your game.

213
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,110
But yeah.

214
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,550
Limit one rev reminder per 15 minutes, right?

215
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,730
Um, yeah.

216
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,410
So, you know, I'm not gonna be perfect at the game.

217
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,150
It's my first time playing it.

218
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,730
And first time using a lot of these new controls.

219
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,730
So just be patient with me while I learn the game.

220
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,650
Thank you.

221
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,910
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,110
Hmm.

223
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,050
Works on more than just Capcom.

224
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,410
It's been adopted as a universal code.

225
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,250
Probably.

226
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,390
All good, Mito.

227
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,370
Thank you.

228
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,210
Enjoy the game first.

229
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:25,970
Thank you.

230
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,610
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

231
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,610
Anyway, are we ready to get back into it?

232
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,150
I've yapped.

233
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,550
I've yapped for like 15 minutes.

234
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,010
Am I lagging?

235
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,180
Maybe it's okay.

236
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,720
Okay, let's go.

237
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,340
Devil may cry.

238
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,780
Here we are.

239
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,580
Devil hunter.

240
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
And we just beat that guy.

241
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,620
Oh, shall we try the other outfit?

242
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,040
Since I did this outfit before.

243
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,680
Shall we try this one with our little...

244
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,020
Do you think they can grab the scarf?

245
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,100
Hello, Mito.

246
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Hello, Brandon.

247
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,960
Yeah, we should try it.

248
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,160
Okay, why not, why not?

249
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,560
I thought it would be like how, you know, if you...

250
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,300
Oh.

251
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,800
Oh, I was like, why are you...

252
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,320
I already got out.

253
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,260
I already got out too.

254
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,760
Holy moly loud.

255
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,280
Hold on, I'm gonna go fix that.

256
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,580
Why is it so loud?

257
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,940
Why is it so loud?

258
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,980
Thank you so much, Salken.

259
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,440
Oh my goodness.

260
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,840
Have you ever played Sly Cooper games?

261
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,700
I haven't.

262
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,580
Would you consider trying them?

263
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,220
Maybe.

264
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,800
There's a sexy fox lady that chases him.

265
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,660
I see.

266
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
Hold on, I'm gonna go fix this...

267
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,680
The sound on this thing real quick.

268
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,300
I don't know why it's so loud.

269
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,800
Hold on one moment.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
Oh, it's at like 100% volume.

271
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,780
When did that happen?

272
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,580
Save.

273
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,340
Okay.

274
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,660
That should be good.

275
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,360
That should be better.

276
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,740
Actually, I'm gonna turn it down.

277
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,260
Just leave it a little bit more just in case.

278
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,260
I can always turn it up.

279
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,240
Minto, I want to talk about severance.

280
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,060
Oh my gosh, me too.

281
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,880
Oh my gosh, Mogu messaged me this morning and was just like...

282
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,800
Minto, I have no one else to talk about severance with.

283
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,760
Nobody's watching it.

284
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,700
I was like...

285
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Because I don't want to...

286
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,080
So for those who don't know, the season 2 finale aired last night and it was like...

287
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,780
I don't want to talk about it because there's probably so many people that haven't watched it.

288
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,360
So I'm also just been like...

289
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,040
Who do I talk about with severance?

290
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,960
I can talk about with Mogu.

291
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,980
Severance is a TV show.

292
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,720
It's really good.

293
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,160
It's really, really good.

294
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,600
It's...

295
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,260
I don't want to get too much into it now because we're about to start the game, but...

296
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,100
Obtain the winged talisman.

297
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,410
What do I have?

298
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,810
Let's see.

299
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,490
What do we have?

300
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,030
Oh, I have...

301
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,070
I have 1100.

302
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,170
Nice.

303
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,310
So we could get...

304
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,870
Okay, so let me actually look at these because...

305
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,970
Okay.

306
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,190
Why, why then?

307
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,210
Why, why, why, why?

308
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,750
And why, why?

309
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,630
Mid-air.

310
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,630
Why, why?

311
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,370
Then a pause and then a why?

312
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,590
Yesterday was my birthday, but I didn't want to bother between...

313
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,730
Between on or after the collab.

314
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,050
Could I ask you for a song, please?

315
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,470
Of course!

316
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,050
Lerian is how I say her name.

317
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:13,670
I hope so.

318
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,430
Happy birthday to you.

319
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,950
Happy birthday to you.

320
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,510
Happy birthday, Lerian.

321
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:22,630
Chuu!

322
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,670
Happy birthday to you.

323
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,270
Happy birthday!

324
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,810
Thank you, thank you.

325
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,410
Testing.

326
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,590
Oh, that one wasn't loud.

327
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,310
It was the...

328
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,930
It was the sponge vibe that was loud.

329
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,730
Thank you!

330
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,590
Alternate outfit that you have Nero in is based on his prototype design.

331
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,070
It was originally meant to be named Rodin.

332
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,830
The sculptor and...

333
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,770
He was supposed to be like a Sherlock Holmes character.

334
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,290
Sipping tea as he...

335
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,910
Oh, I'm so glad they changed him.

336
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,490
He was supposed to be Brash.

337
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,890
Maybe we get Streak 2?

338
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,110
Maybe Streak 2 would be good.

339
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,490
Or, was there anything I was saving up for?

340
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,310
Snatch.

341
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,550
We could do the snatch.

342
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,830
Snatch is...

343
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,470
Wait, what?

344
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,050
Oh, air hike!

345
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,890
Air hike is what I was saving up for.

346
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,570
Do you have air hike?

347
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,170
I don't yet.

348
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,570
Okay, okay, okay.

349
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,470
Saving up, saving up.

350
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,730
Saving up, saving up.

351
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,930
Whoa!

352
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,770
I could get rid of some stuff.

353
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,090
I mean, I could get rid of some things.

354
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,570
I don't have that many things, though.

355
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,470
I haven't even...

356
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,610
Bought any, like, charge shot stuff.

357
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,550
Big snatch, though.

358
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,270
I know!

359
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,650
I don't have enough for that, even.

360
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:00,930
Oh!

361
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,130
Oh!

362
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,330
Oh, I accidentally pressed...

363
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:04,870
I pressed...

364
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,630
Oh my gosh, sometimes...

365
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,410
Sometimes I get into, like, Japanese game brand...

366
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,230
where X...

367
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,810
on, like, a PlayStation controller...

368
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,450
is back.

369
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,970
That would have been so bad.

370
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,810
And items.

371
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,290
I can't afford another blorb.

372
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,470
So we'll save up for that, as well.

373
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,690
I'm good.

374
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,610
Mission starter!

375
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,270
Yeah, X and O are swapped.

376
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,170
Oh, look at us!

377
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,010
We're so different.

378
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,790
War, war, so...

379
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,630
Uh, what, what, what, what is the mission again?

380
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,330
So we just did the Coliseum, no?

381
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,160
Ooh.

382
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,180
Is his hair even different?

383
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,660
Boy looks so bruh-ish.

384
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
40 minutes.

385
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,450
Friend or foe?

386
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,750
Probably foe.

387
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,970
If it's Devil May Cry, probably.

388
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,650
Oh, here comes the battle music.

389
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,350
Oh no, what is this thing?

390
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:19,950
Ah!

391
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,950
Um, I can't...

392
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,350
The camera angle is really bad.

393
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,050
Wait, it's a...

394
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:37,530
Hold on.

395
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,530
Sorry, I forgot.

396
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:44,930
This...

397
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,720
Why, why?

398
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,660
Why, why, why?

399
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,240
Oh, no.

400
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,220
I'm an idiot.

401
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,720
Why?

402
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,240
Why?

403
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,400
Pause, why?

404
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,860
Sorry, I just wanted...

405
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,700
But there is this one.

406
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,220
Why, why, why?

407
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,320
That's what I was thinking of.

408
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,140
Guns work best against these enemies, do they?

409
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,200
Guns and grabs.

410
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,220
Grab is...

411
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:08,960
Oh!

412
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:14,980
Oh.

413
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,200
Oh!

414
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,220
Oh my god!

415
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,430
What the hell is this thing?

416
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,270
Ew, it turned into a lizard!

417
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,350
Bug.

418
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,630
What is this?

419
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,890
Oh my god!

420
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,470
I wish I could grab him again.

421
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:41,710
Ouch!

422
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,270
Wait.

423
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,130
Oh my god!

424
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,770
Oh my god, it's disgusting!

425
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:49,890
Wait.

426
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,630
Thank you, though, for the tip about grabbing him.

427
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,810
Wait.

428
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,210
I'm trying.

429
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,610
Oh.

430
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,970
Come on, Dante.

431
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,150
Come on.

432
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,340
Oh, shoot.

433
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,440
Grab him.

434
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,260
Grab him.

435
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,000
Ouch!

436
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,240
Come here.

437
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,550
Ouch!

438
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,770
Air grab!

439
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,710
There we go.

440
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,070
OK.

441
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,670
OK.

442
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,010
Oh, I said Dante?

443
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,650
My bad.

444
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,470
The force of habit.

445
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,820
The force of habit again!

446
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,600
Sorry, Nero.

447
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:58,820
After obtaining a Rusalka corpse, entering certain areas will cause the devil bringer to be tinged with glowing light.

448
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,820
When this light is visible, succumb to its call and search for nearby items or secret missions.

449
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,420
OK, I'm searching.

450
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,520
Wait, I'm searching.

451
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm searching.

452
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,660
These are kind of freaky, no?

453
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,460
These are kind of freaky.

454
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,000
I will destroy everything.

455
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,180
I'm just search...

456
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,480
Searching for stuff.

457
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,020
A little secret sensor.

458
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,820
How cute!

459
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,320
Um, is it...

460
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,620
This doesn't seem to be glowing.

461
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,960
Am I stupid?

462
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,600
It doesn't seem...

463
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,160
Is it glowing more than usual?

464
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,860
I don't think I've ever paid attention to what his arm looked like.

465
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,740
We're farming some rorbs right quick.

466
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,840
Oh!

467
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,280
Oh, now it's glowing.

468
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,740
Oh!

469
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,200
There we go.

470
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,280
That's a secret mission.

471
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:56,940
I see.

472
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
I learned.

473
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,580
It's pretty obvious what happened.

474
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,800
I see now.

475
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,820
Just destroy everything.

476
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
I hate landscaping!

477
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,060
I want an open world layout!

478
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,220
Oh, I can destroy these too.

479
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,920
Nice.

480
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,480
Oh, nice!

481
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,320
Some grorbs.

482
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,360
This is great farming!

483
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:27,500
Oh.

484
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,060
Healthy Minta.

485
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,860
I'm as strong and healthy as an ox.

486
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,900
Look, they even give us a time statue so that we can...

487
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,020
Get lots of rorbs and then shop, baby, shop.

488
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,920
I wonder what the secret mission is.

489
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,160
Shall we check it out?

490
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,520
Wait.

491
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,280
I thought it glowed, but...

492
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,300
I thought...

493
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,280
Wait, it is glowing.

494
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:07,700
Oh?

495
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,540
Wait,

496
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,000
there's another one.

497
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,260
I can't get up there though.

498
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,800
Secret rorbs.

499
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,080
Oh, right there!

500
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,180
Oh my gosh.

501
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,180
The secret mission is extremely hard.

502
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,920
I'm really...

503
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,380
Not good with the challenge stuff.

504
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,240
I know you guys know that though.

505
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,480
But that's okay.

506
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,100
We're here for the fun of the game, not the challenge of the game.

507
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,820
Well, it was just a little bit of a challenge, but...

508
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Let's see what it is.

509
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,360
It is...

510
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,440
Raise your stylish ranking without using attacks?

511
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,000
Like, just dodge only?

512
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,110
Dodging and taunting?

513
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:25,370
That sounds scary.

514
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:26,530
Okay.

515
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:27,810
Oops.

516
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,930
All right.

517
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,270
I'm a professional break stuff.

518
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,050
More?

519
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,050
Or is it below?

520
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,630
I must be hinting the thing up below, right?

521
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,530
Oh, this is gonna drive me insane now.

522
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,190
I'm gonna be like, where's the secrets?

523
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,830
This is gonna drive me insane.

524
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,430
Yeah, I really did just say nope.

525
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,750
Okay.

526
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,830
Let's go.

527
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,470
Oh.

528
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,490
Oh, shoot.

529
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,050
It's this guy.

530
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,630
Yeah.

531
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,310
Yeah.

532
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,070
Oh, man.

533
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,520
Oh, wait.

534
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,380
It's a Y.

535
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:29,980
Y.

536
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,480
I messed up.

537
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,580
Oh, there's more than one of them.

538
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,060
Oh, I wish I got the other guy.

539
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,080
That'd be insane, right?

540
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,180
Oh, maybe it did.

541
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,400
Why?

542
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,280
Why?

543
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,740
Why?

544
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:50,940
Why?

545
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,540
Why?

546
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,180
Why?

547
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,460
No, it's...

548
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,660
Why?

549
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,040
Why?

550
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,540
Why?

551
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:56,980
Why?

552
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,500
Why?

553
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,120
Why?

554
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,340
Why?

555
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,200
Oh, I did it.

556
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,240
Hahaha.

557
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,980
I can do it when I'm not panicking.

558
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,540
Why?

559
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:08,840
Why?

560
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,660
Why?

561
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,080
Why?

562
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,460
Why?

563
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,100
Oh.

564
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,100
Why?

565
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,540
Why?

566
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,120
Why?

567
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,040
I'm destroying the foundation of this home.

568
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,700
Okay.

569
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,460
I guess we're good.

570
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,620
Wait, is it glowing?

571
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Was I crazy?

572
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,680
It is glowing.

573
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,580
To what?

574
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,480
It's glowing here.

575
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,920
Oh.

576
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

577
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,040
How many secret missions have we missed?

578
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,780
Why, Victor?

579
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,220
Why?

580
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:00,200
Puppet master, manipulate the gyro blades and raise everything.

581
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,700
You guys think I can do this one?

582
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,200
This one is easy.

583
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
I feel like it sounds...

584
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,560
This one is doable.

585
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,840
We could try.

586
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,340
How do I...

587
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,100
Wait, um...

588
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,560
There was...

589
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,400
Oh, there's a time limit.

590
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,120
Oh, wait.

591
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:20,760
Hold on.

592
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,100
Uh, oh, it was...

593
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,460
Oh, shoot.

594
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:23,940
Uh...

595
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,060
Oh.

596
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,460
There was like a way that I can...

597
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,340
Oh, hold on.

598
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,780
How do I...

599
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,040
Wait, we got, uh...

600
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,700
Uh...

601
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,720
It was a...

602
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,800
It was...

603
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,440
I have to like...

604
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,760
Oh, I...

605
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,760
I activate it and then I cut it with the sword and then I B, right?

606
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,660
I remember now.

608
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,440
Sorry about that.

609
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,120
Run!

610
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,500
Is there anything down here?

611
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,780
Okay, doesn't seem like it.

612
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,820
This is literally just what we did before, no?

613
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,080
Is it wanting me to...

614
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,320
What does raise everything mean?

615
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,480
We got one out of five, so...

616
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,640
Go!

617
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,620
Did I miss one?

618
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
Oh, wait.

619
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,340
I got something.

620
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,600
What did I get?

621
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,720
Oh!

622
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,340
Oh, it's the blue things!

623
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,080
Ah!

624
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,440
Wait.

625
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,640
I'm gonna restart.

626
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,320
Actually, it won't let me.

627
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,080
Ah!

628
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,520
I see, I see, I see.

629
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,600
Okay, okay.

630
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,240
It's the blue things.

631
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Ah, okay.

632
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,860
Oh, this one might be tricky.

633
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,440
Okay, so there's two here and then there's the one.

634
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,020
I don't know if I can make it though.

635
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,820
I don't think I can make it.

636
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,360
I only have 20 seconds left.

637
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,180
That's okay though.

638
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,050
Yeah, not this run, but that's okay.

639
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,110
I was learning what it meant.

640
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,210
There we go.

641
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,650
Oh, see?

642
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:24,970
Okay.

643
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:26,710
Maybe we can...

644
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,130
I'm getting orbs at least.

645
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,010
Do I get to keep these?

646
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,390
Failed.

647
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,330
Yeah.

648
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,730
We'll get them next time.

649
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,210
Okay, this one looks doable.

650
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:42,970
Oh, sorry.

651
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,010
I keep pressing Y action and not...

652
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,750
Not...

653
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,690
Action, action.

654
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,090
Okay.

655
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,410
Okay.

656
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,530
It's a slow way to farm.

657
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,670
There we go.

658
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,370
Number one.

659
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,910
Okay.

660
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,030
Please don't go too far.

661
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,870
Where are you?

662
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,690
Oh, it went too far.

663
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,090
Okay.

664
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,590
Nice.

665
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:28,830
Okay.

666
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,430
Oh, no, no, no.

667
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,190
Okay, it went down the hallway.

668
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:39,890
Good enough, good enough.

669
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,590
Okay, world record pace, baby.

670
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,570
Probably.

671
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,450
Yeah.

672
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:50,770
Okay.

673
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,560
I'm gonna need it to bounce off.

674
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,620
There we go.

675
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,060
Nice.

676
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,400
Okay.

677
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,020
Yeah.

678
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,520
How far did that go, actually?

679
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,320
I might have just screwed myself a little bit.

680
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,340
Yeah, just a little bit.

681
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,140
Okay, okay.

682
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,840
Okay, okay, okay.

683
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,480
Nice, nice, nice.

684
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,880
Um, I need the camera to change, please.

685
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,100
Camera to change, please.

686
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,840
Thank you.

687
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,540
Okay.

688
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,640
Oh, perfect.

689
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,520
Please.

690
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,640
Oh, please.

691
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,740
Please, please, please.

692
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,180
Please.

693
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,860
Oh.

694
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,920
Yeah!

695
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,520
Oh, that was so lucky.

696
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,320
That was so lucky, baby.

697
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,600
Hold on, let's farm our rorbs a little bit before we leave.

698
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,820
Yeah,

699
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,040
yeah, yeah.

700
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,840
18 seconds left.

701
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Not even sweating?

702
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,340
No.

703
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,520
I didn't sweat.

704
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,560
No.

705
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,280
I wasn't worried even a little bit.

706
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,400
Get all of our money, baby.

707
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,930
I like how there's just these in the way.

708
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,590
All right.

709
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,330
Good mission, guys.

710
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,450
The one secret mission I could do.

711
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,410
Are these repeatable?

712
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,130
I'm not sure.

713
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,610
Any experts in chat?

714
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,480
One blorb fragment.

715
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,420
But you won't get the blorbs.

716
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,780
Ah, I see, I see.

717
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,020
Oh, shoot.

718
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,060
Oh.

719
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:15,960
Ouch.

720
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,720
Ouch!

721
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,500
Ouch.

722
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,140
Oh, that guy had just one hit left.

723
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,180
That's so funny.

724
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,840
Where did you come from?

725
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,950
I think I need to be locked on.

726
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,430
There we go.

727
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,290
Nice.

728
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,610
Is the game low?

729
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,110
The game sound?

730
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,810
Or are you just wanting the BGM?

731
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,810
The music up.

732
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,850
Is the sound okay?

733
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,220
It's good?

734
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,840
Okay, okay.

735
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,260
Just making sure.

736
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,600
Oh, why do I keep doing that?

737
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,260
I know what you are.

738
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,900
Wait, what is this?

739
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,620
What is...

740
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,840
What do we need you for?

741
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,440
Oh, I thought I was gonna have to destroy it.

742
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:52,700
Okay.

743
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,000
You don't think it'll fall off the platform, no?

744
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,350
Okay.

745
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,870
Free blade!

746
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,890
I

747
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,340
guess we'll...

748
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,820
We won't know.

749
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,120
It made it!

750
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh my gosh.

751
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,440
Yeah!

752
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,340
I'm too good!

753
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,820
Yippee!

754
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,430
Oh, oh, I can't move.

755
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:46,710
Okay.

756
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,190
That was so rude.

757
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,090
Wait.

758
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,650
How did I...

759
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,230
What's happening?

760
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,090
Where did...

761
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:54,890
When did I...

762
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,510
Who did I...

763
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,390
How did I...

764
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,510
Oh.

765
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,210
Come here.

766
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,310
Come here, you.

767
00:40:59,490 --> 00:40:59,650
Oh.

768
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,110
You stupid little...

769
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,650
Whatever you are.

770
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,150
Yeah!

771
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,310
Got his butt.

772
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,390
Easy.

773
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,270
I'm grabbing you.

774
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,170
I'm grabbing you.

775
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,480
Oh, dang it.

776
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,060
I tried to...

777
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,480
Oh.

778
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,810
I killed him already.

779
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,090
Oh!

780
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,190
One

781
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,510
second.

782
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,150
What did you say?

783
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,010
Yesterday was my birthday, but I didn't want to disturb the collab.

784
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,570
I'm sorry I missed people's birthdays yesterday.

785
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,630
Can I please get a happy birthday for my Kamiyoshi?

786
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,150
Of course, FredFrog.

787
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,610
Happy birthday to you.

788
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,270
Happy birthday to you.

789
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,110
Happy birthday, dear FredFrog.

790
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,550
Happy birthday to you.

791
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,800
The collab was fun.

792
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,560
It was...

793
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,480
It was very fun for me too.

794
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,700
Especially learning the game and stuff.

795
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,340
Seeing why it's the hot stuff.

796
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,220
For those who don't know, I played...

797
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,780
I played Repo.

798
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,280
Okay, I guess none of this stuff breaks.

799
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,300
I played Repo for the first time yesterday.

800
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,600
The R-E-P-O.

801
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,240
Wing Talisman!

802
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,240
A talisman made of crystallized angel wing.

803
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,620
It can stimulate a divine response in specific equipment.

804
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,500
That was the mission, though.

805
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,240
Oh,

806
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,060
I could go in here.

807
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,540
What about in here?

808
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,340
Let me in!

809
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,740
Let me in!

810
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,200
Let me in!

811
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,780
Let me in!

812
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,040
Funny platform time.

813
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,620
I'm scared.

814
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,280
Okay.

815
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,820
Okay, where's the next part?

816
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,800
Oh, wait, I see it.

817
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,060
Oh, never mind.

818
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,660
Turn around.

819
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,780
Maybe I go over here.

820
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,040
Oh, something's glowing.

821
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:32,920
Something's afoot.

822
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,040
Roarbs are afoot!

823
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,720
It pays to be curious.

824
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,960
Imagine if there's fall damage in this room.

825
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,860
What is that thing?

826
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,900
More roarbs!

827
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,600
Okay, I'm gonna need you to grab that thing.

828
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,340
No!

829
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,940
Grab it, please!

830
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,080
Where are you looking?

831
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,440
Nero, please!

832
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,100
Oh!

833
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,380
Oh, gosh!

834
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,450
Am I missing something, or...?

835
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:20,410
Oh, there's another platform over there!

836
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:22,690
I see it now.

837
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,970
I was trying to grab for non-existent...

838
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,370
thing.

839
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,930
Oh, oops.

840
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:29,730
I messed up.

841
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,880
Okay, we're doing this on purpose.

842
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:38,820
There we go.

843
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,080
Okay.

844
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,120
Okay.

845
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,320
Again!

846
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:46,780
Again!

847
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:47,900
Again!

848
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,260
It's actually kind of fun, though.

849
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,760
Striking it rich, baby.

850
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,220
Oh, yeah.

851
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,360
Oh, yeah, what's on this side?

852
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,140
A whole lot of nothing.

853
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:04,890
More nothing.

854
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,050
Oh, I have to...

855
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,010
Oh!

856
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:10,930
I did get it!

857
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,530
I got the holy water!

858
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,170
Oh, I didn't even realize that's what that was!

859
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,050
So the thing I was trying to grab earlier was the holy water?

860
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,330
I knew it with my sense.

861
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,450
Wait, so then...

862
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,950
What was I trying to grab?

863
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,230
That right there, that blue.

864
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,210
Actually, I don't know anything anymore.

865
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,110
Wait, there's yellow here!

866
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,210
Oh!

867
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,110
Give me the star!

868
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,630
The vital star, please.

869
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:42,970
How do I grab it?

870
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:43,270
Oh!

871
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,470
With my hand.

872
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,030
Wait.

873
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:48,110
Nero.

874
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,070
Nero.

875
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,310
He's reaching for everywhere, but...

876
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,450
He's reaching for every...

877
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,150
Ah, I got it.

878
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:56,310
Okay.

879
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,410
You forgore?

880
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,650
I did for a brief moment, and then I remember.

881
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,430
And then I remember.

882
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,800
Nice!

883
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,020
I remember.

884
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,720
I rem...

885
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,680
Ah, shoot.

886
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,600
I tried to do it.

887
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,660
Oh, we're in this room again!

888
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,240
Oh,

889
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,240
these guys too?

890
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:50,960
Oh my gosh.

891
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:01,580
Yeah!

892
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:02,580
Yeah!

893
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,460
Oh, shoot.

894
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:08,540
Okay.

895
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,040
Do I have to lock on for that?

896
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,980
Or am I just doing it wrong, I think.

897
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,540
Oop!

898
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,180
You're still a little clown.

899
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,800
Oh, I'm still a little clown.

900
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:20,640
Oh!

901
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,860
What am I...

902
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,500
What am I attacking?

903
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,740
Oh my god, there's so many of them!

904
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:36,640
Ouch!

905
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,660
Please!

906
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,280
There we go.

907
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,840
God, it's a little stinking, but...

908
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,780
I lost my...

909
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,120
I lost my style points!

910
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:51,830
Ouch!

911
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,210
I tried to avoid it.

912
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,650
Those chickens don't look very appetizing.

913
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,210
They're so skinny!

914
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,690
This is the way I need to go.

915
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,090
This is the way...

916
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,330
I came from.

917
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,870
Yeah, the floor fell through.

918
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

919
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,130
Okay.

920
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,850
This is the way I need to go.

921
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,870
Skinny chicken.

922
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:30,870
Who's here?

923
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,790
Oh, we're in the hallway!

924
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:36,370
Oh!

925
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:48,770
Oh, why?

926
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,030
I could do it before.

927
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,390
Wait.

928
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:53,610
Ah, I did it!

929
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:53,990
I did it!

930
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,790
He just wasn't in the air.

931
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,130
But I got a little bit of a move in.

932
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,090
Oh.

933
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:05,350
Where are you?

934
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:05,810
Come here.

935
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,990
Oh, he was still dying!

936
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:24,970
Atomic.

937
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,170
Spin to win.

938
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:28,650
Wait.

939
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,310
Maybe I'm not getting enough air.

940
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:39,010
Wait.

941
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,570
I think it's...

942
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:46,670
It's definitely my fault.

943
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,030
I'm like, trying to spin.

944
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,710
These ice guys were in the first game.

945
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:53,530
Were they?

946
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,430
What?

947
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:58,250
Where...

948
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,410
Where do I...

949
00:49:59,410 --> 00:49:59,910
What do...

950
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,310
I got the thingy that I needed.

951
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,470
What to do with the thingy that I got.

952
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,490
Slight pause.

953
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,130
Yeah, yeah.

954
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,310
I'm just...

955
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,630
I'm just whacking it off.

956
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,310
Away.

957
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,130
Wait, I'm whacking...

958
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,090
I'm whacking...

959
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,610
I'm whacking too much.

960
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,150
I'm whacking it too much.

961
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,390
I'm whack...

962
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,870
I'm whacking away in the air way too much.

963
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:30,430
You guys know what I'm saying.

964
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,890
I'm just whacking it...

965
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:34,750
Whacking away.

966
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:35,690
I'm like...

967
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,890
Where do I go?

968
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,550
Wait.

969
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,730
The mission.

970
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,050
Oh, I didn't mean to taunt.

971
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,390
I'm just taunting to nobody.

972
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:54,790
Weed whacker.

973
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,490
We can now get a blorb.

974
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,850
Another blorb, I think.

975
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:02,990
Which is great.

976
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,810
Main hall?

977
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,450
Where is that?

978
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,970
Oh, where am I?

979
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,370
Where do I go?

980
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:16,750
Main hall.

981
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:18,570
The middle is...

982
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,440
The red door next to you.

983
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,420
Thank you.

984
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,460
That's right!

985
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,380
The wing talisman is vibrating.

986
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,460
It must be reacting to something in this room!

987
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,200
And we get to bounce again.

988
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,400
Hold on, let me get my money first.

989
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,240
Sorry, guys.

990
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:49,900
I'm obsessed.

991
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,400
Where is my money?

992
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,160
The church owes me a lot of money.

993
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,540
Can you imagine being the priest who, like, keeps putting these chairs out?

994
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,800
Like, someone keeps destroying all of our...

995
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,760
All of our seats!

996
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,300
And then he comes back 20 minutes later.

997
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,240
And they're all...

998
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,620
They're all destroyed again.

999
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,800
We need to get this done before Sunday, or...

1000
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,000
Or our audience won't have anywhere to rest.

1001
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,600
Okay, where am I going?

1002
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,200
Here.

1003
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,720
Oh, actually...

1004
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,580
Oh!

1005
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,040
Oh, I didn't think that would work.

1006
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,640
Oh!

1007
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,940
Right in between the eyes.

1008
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,110
Okay, so I'm guessing when I go through there, the...

1009
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,570
I can't get...

1010
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,910
Can't grab it midair, or...

1011
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,590
I can grab it midair!

1012
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:36,610
I learned.

1013
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,050
But my thing is also reacting.

1014
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,310
Oh, what could it be reacting to?

1015
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:42,330
Oh!

1016
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,670
You need air hike to get up there.

1017
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,510
I think so, too.

1018
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:53,790
Ah,

1019
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,610
I don't have enough style points.

1020
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:05,210
I could, like, if I could buy it with rorbs, you know, I'd buy it with rorbs, but...

1021
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,910
We also just...

1022
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,410
It sucks you don't get the style points until the end of the...

1023
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:14,270
Until the end, you know.

1024
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,550
Even still, I don't even know if I'd have enough.

1025
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:25,710
You're such a genie.

1026
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,810
Refund everything and get air hike.

1027
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:39,810
Oh, yeah, I think maybe actually we can do that, and then we'll just get it, right?

1028
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,590
We'll get it back.

1029
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,830
Okay, so cancel all is refund.

1030
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,230
Okay, abilities.

1031
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:49,470
Air hike.

1032
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:50,830
Confirm.

1033
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,270
Yes, all right.

1034
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,910
Also, um, item.

1035
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,210
Let's grab a blorb while we're here.

1036
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,550
Very nice.

1037
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,550
Okay, so...

1038
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,490
Watch it be a secret level.

1039
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,030
That's just like...

1040
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,630
You're gonna...

1041
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:13,770
Oh.

1042
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:19,150
You're gonna really want every skill besides...

1043
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,450
Wait.

1044
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,180
Guys, what am I doing wrong?

1045
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,940
Nero, use your arms!

1046
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,100
Reach up, Nero!

1047
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,920
Need level three.

1048
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:44,960
Exceed.

1049
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:52,520
Oh.

1050
00:55:59,120 --> 00:55:59,980
Let's exceed.

1051
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,180
That one.

1052
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,420
Oh, exceed three?

1053
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,960
Increasing the x gauge to three slots allows you to...

1054
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,880
Exceed is the rev bar.

1055
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:31,910
Extends attacks.

1056
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,530
Well, I'm gonna just gonna...

1057
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,650
Well, I'm gonna cancel all.

1058
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:45,230
I'm gonna get our stuff back because I don't know if we're about to go into a fight or if this is the end of the mission.

1059
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,230
So, what did I have?

1060
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,510
I had this one for sure.

1061
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,110
We had this one for sure.

1062
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,150
Oh, I didn't do exceed yet.

1063
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,890
We did streak.

1064
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,590
I don't think I have caliber.

1065
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:11,980
Snatch two.

1066
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,580
There was something else we had.

1067
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,240
Oh, speed.

1068
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,010
Okay, that's all that we had.

1069
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:22,330
Okay.

1070
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,060
We'll come back for it.

1071
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,480
Some people are saying you can come back for it.

1072
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:35,330
No money.

1073
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,180
Grab.

1074
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,320
Can I grab that?

1075
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,160
Grab.

1076
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,380
Grab that.

1077
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,120
Can I grab that?

1078
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,060
Grab that.

1079
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:55,600
Grab that.

1080
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,440
Grab that.

1081
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,140
Grab that.

1082
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,160
Grab that.

1083
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,540
Depth perception doko.

1084
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,660
I don't even know where it is.

1085
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,140
It's behind...

1086
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,300
Oh, I thought it was behind the pillar.

1087
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,080
Wait.

1088
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,440
Oh.

1089
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,180
Nero?

1090
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,220
Oh, there we go.

1091
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,840
Every time I start to start to question him, he actually does his job.

1092
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,840
Wow, this is so long.

1093
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,460
I don't want to get shocked.

1094
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,200
Electrocuted.

1095
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,720
Just grab it.

1096
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:43,910
As long as you don't call him Dante.

1097
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,010
He's still alive.

1098
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,470
Oh, I think there's something wrong with our guy.

1099
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,210
Nah, this is how he always wakes up, probably.

1100
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,420
Do you guys not wake up like this?

1101
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,110
That's what happens when you embrace the power of God and anime.

1102
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:26,290
No way, he thought that was normal and fine?

1103
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,410
Wait.

1104
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:33,690
It is only a matter of time before his location is revealed.

1105
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:37,210
True.

1106
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,010
Oh my gosh.

1107
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:57,750
This guy reminds me of the crazy scientist dude from Final Fantasy 7.

1108
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:58,750
Luke.

1109
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:00,570
Hojo?

1110
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,650
Is that his name?

1111
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,030
Cocky Kid Nero?

1112
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,290
Yes!

1113
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:24,690
Our priority is to capture Dante.

1114
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,410
Why you...

1115
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,550
I don't think we can keep calling him the holiness.

1116
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,950
Nice stutter, nerd.

1117
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,650
Hey, I haven't stuttered too.

1118
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,830
Hey, I haven't stuttered.

1119
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,760
All right, I forgot.

1120
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:07,820
C!

1121
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,100
I wish we got 5,000 points that I could use.

1122
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,200
See, we don't even have enough.

1123
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,040
I didn't think so.

1124
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,120
Dang it.

1125
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,480
Dang it.

1126
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,820
Oh my gosh, how did I not get all the rorbs?

1127
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,220
Crazy.

1128
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:25,820
Dab.

1129
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,680
Dab.

1130
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:30,600
Next.

1131
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:35,860
Mission.

1132
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,020
Resurrection.

1133
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,900
Release the true power that resides within.

1134
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,120
Okay.

1135
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,200
I think I, yeah, I spent everything on the blorb.

1136
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,200
We have a couple vital stars.

1137
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,320
I got four of them.

1138
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,620
No M stars.

1139
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,300
Only S stars.

1140
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,100
Definitely no L stars.

1141
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,220
Only W stars.

1142
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,020
Mission Chuni time.

1143
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,560
Are we gonna get devil mode?

1144
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,720
Devil trigger mode?

1145
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,440
Coldy water one.

1146
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:14,740
Blorb.

1147
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,540
We can only get one more blorb, you guys.

1148
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,580
This is so sad.

1149
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,740
This is so, so sad.

1150
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,700
And yeah, we're gonna, I guess, save up for air hike still.

1151
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,800
Should be, hopefully, the next mission, right?

1152
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,360
Hopefully.

1153
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,180
All right.

1154
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,900
Every blorb is precious.

1155
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,240
But what if we find a blorb in the wild?

1156
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,840
Like, like so.

1157
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,200
We can still add more blorb if we find them in the wild, no?

1158
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:03,620
Blorb spotted!

1159
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,240
I like how it's literally just out in the open.

1160
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,540
You just have to be paying attention.

1161
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,400
Oh yeah, for those asking, the blorbs give you more to your health, more to your HP bar.

1162
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,020
I'm just going down.

1163
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,260
Make my tummy drop a little.

1164
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,980
Oh, this is the...

1165
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,140
By your hand, you cannot break our clasp.

1166
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,320
The power lies in another's grasp.

1167
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,340
Okay, I got that.

1168
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,000
Which way should we go?

1169
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,340
Oh, I think that's...

1170
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,800
Wait, is this a door?

1171
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,560
Okay, I guess I only have this way.

1172
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,270
Good job.

1173
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,770
Nice try, Nero.

1174
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,770
Raiden!

1175
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,430
These are so cool!

1176
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,630
Yeah, yeah, he's reminding me.

1177
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,810
Oh shoot.

1178
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,100
Oh, they attack when they're red.

1179
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,420
Oh, they're like the things before.

1180
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:01,050
Oh, I should grab them, maybe.

1181
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:02,250
Let's see.

1182
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:04,190
Oh gosh.

1183
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,030
That's so unfair.

1184
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,490
Don't attack all at once, please.

1185
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,290
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1186
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:20,030
Oh.

1187
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:27,370
Nice.

1188
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:32,290
It's so dramatic.

1189
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:37,030
Where are they?

1190
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:49,630
Nice.

1191
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,580
Where did he go?

1192
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,460
Where'd he go?

1193
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:02,560
Grab him!

1194
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:03,760
Where'd he go?

1195
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,320
Where'd he go?

1196
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,380
Grab him!

1197
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,240
There we go.

1198
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:21,030
There we go, okay.

1199
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:24,920
Those guys, they're like...

1200
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:34,110
Yeah, they're like the chest pieces that would attack when they were red and not when they're blue.

1201
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,190
Meow.

1202
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,870
They look like eyeballs.

1203
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,870
I have you.

1204
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,130
Little loopy loop.

1205
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,410
Anymore?

1206
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,650
Can you guys hear the church bells?

1207
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,380
Eyeballs.

1208
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,470
Puzzle time!

1209
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:16,530
Oh!

1210
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,750
Who dat?

1211
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,550
Uh-oh, I'm playing a board game with myself.

1212
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:42,750
Concerning life and death in this hell, we are the ones who weave that spell.

1213
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,170
I hope

1214
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,710
you're lucky.

1215
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:51,910
I'm not.

1216
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:59,590
Oh, if moving forward is what you intend, then guiding your other self to the door is what we recommend.

1217
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,790
I also recommend learning meter.

1218
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,750
And now your fate, we decide.

1219
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,810
Strike us or your progress will be denied.

1220
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:15,850
They're trying, they're trying.

1221
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:16,670
Game room.

1222
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,860
Man, am I handsome.

1223
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,020
So I'm guessing...

1224
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,030
Okay, so we have to land on this.

1225
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,730
It seems to be.

1226
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:50,890
I'm guessing if we land on like red, then enemies will come.

1227
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,290
If we...

1228
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,050
We'll see.

1229
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:55,890
I guess we'll see.

1230
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,210
Five!

1231
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,150
One, two, three, four.

1232
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:05,690
I guess we'll figure it out now!

1233
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:11,250
What's happening?

1234
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,310
What's happening?

1235
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:12,930
Oh my god.

1236
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:16,890
A void?

1237
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:17,510
Uh,

1238
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:20,870
lasers!

1239
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,150
Uh, there's no purple.

1240
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,810
Okay, just kidding.

1241
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:43,460
Easy.

1242
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:47,520
Okay.

1243
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:53,380
You who grasps the die with devilish hand, your fate is sealed by the die's command.

1244
01:09:53,380 --> 01:10:00,700
No matter what fortune you hope to receive, with your devilish touch, unknown fate the die will weave.

1245
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,280
Red equals cardio, yeah.

1246
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:08,980
Six.

1247
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,220
Five!

1248
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:14,800
White.

1249
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,460
We're safe, we're safe, we're safe, we're safe.

1250
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,240
Six!

1251
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:29,980
Nice.

1252
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,380
Oh, man.

1253
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,500
Again?

1254
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,700
You can't catch me.

1255
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,840
You can't catch me.

1256
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,080
You can't catch me.

1257
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,480
You can't catch me.

1258
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,860
You can't catch me.

1259
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,780
They're eating my dust.

1260
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,380
Timer sometimes increases.

1261
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,440
Two!

1262
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,380
Oh, come on.

1263
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,720
Ouchy, ouchy.

1264
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:10,290
Come here, come here.

1265
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:10,870
Ouchy, ouchy.

1266
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:25,980
Ouchy, ouch.

1267
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,100
I like stripping it naked.

1268
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,940
I like taking its clothes.

1269
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,320
Grab, grab, grab.

1270
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,300
You're naked.

1271
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,360
Grab your tops, grabs your bottoms, grabs your panties.

1272
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,580
Three!

1273
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:50,660
Fortune!

1274
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:53,960
Oh.

1275
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,140
Oh.

1276
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,780
Did it just send me back?

1277
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:02,660
Oh.

1278
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,960
What?

1279
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,020
You asshole!

1280
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,380
Four.

1281
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,780
DMC like Akiba's girl.

1282
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:26,140
Fortune real!

1283
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,160
Fortune real!

1284
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,040
Fortune real!

1285
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,660
Oh my god!

1286
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,020
It's raining men.

1287
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,160
It's raining roars.

1288
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,880
So if I get a two, I don't want that.

1289
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,500
Oh, five.

1290
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,500
Please be lasers.

1291
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,240
Dang it.

1292
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,740
I love throwing it into the other guys.

1293
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,480
It's so much fun.

1294
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,020
Okay, where's our other guy?

1295
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,980
I don't know the other words.

1296
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,720
Do you need to know them though?

1297
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,600
What a crazy taunt!

1298
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,480
He's just like, I'll slit your throat.

1299
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,430
Oh.

1300
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:06,290
Ah,

1301
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:19,880
dang it.

1302
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,180
I tried to do it.

1303
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,160
I did the move, but I was already...

1304
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,140
Okay.

1305
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,880
You should see the S-rank taunt.

1306
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,160
Three.

1307
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,980
One, two.

1308
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,600
Oh, we're safe.

1309
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,180
Okay, as long as I can get...

1310
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,800
Where are we at?

1311
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,460
I don't have to get exactly, do I?

1312
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,860
Is it gonna be like bouncing me back and forth?

1313
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,680
If I get like a four, is it gonna go one, two, three, four?

1314
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,180
Or do I have to get exactly a three?

1315
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,980
The time has come and so have I.

1316
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,460
Thank you for the super chat.

1317
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,980
Thank you.

1318
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:08,260
Three or more?

1319
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,020
Okay, okay, okay.

1320
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,600
All right.

1321
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,480
Lady luck.

1322
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,960
Oh my god.

1323
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:30,740
Wow.

1324
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:46,020
That's my favorite part of that song.

1325
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,440
The, uh...

1326
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,160
Oh, it was a time guy.

1327
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,580
Of the Umapyoi Densetsu.

1328
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,880
That's my favorite line of the song.

1329
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,430
It's talking about, it's like...

1330
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,940
Hey, lady luck, kiss me today.

1331
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,550
Strange room.

1332
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:28,290
The ambiance goes crazy.

1333
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,730
Oh, those look ominous.

1334
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,770
They definitely won't come alive.

1335
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:42,010
Minta, that's me.

1336
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:47,050
There's a secret afoot.

1337
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,010
Wimpy sword.

1338
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:57,890
Oh, this guy.

1339
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:02,690
Hojo.

1340
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,030
Yeah, this is how the song goes.

1341
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:13,130
The time has come and so have I.

1342
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,890
Agnes.

1343
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:20,550
Stake.

1344
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:25,370
Pipi.

1345
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:31,370
Dang,

1346
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:39,650
it's brief.

1347
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,170
Your d-d-d-d-demise.

1348
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,670
Don't you think that's a little harsh?

1349
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,950
Killing me because the way I t-t-t-t-talk.

1350
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:52,850
Oh, he's so...

1351
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:53,110
Hero!

1352
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,450
Buster always makes it land on the next round of rotation.

1353
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,550
Oh, I didn't realize.

1354
01:18:58,710 --> 01:18:59,170
Thanks, Lori.

1355
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,680
Thank you for the pink super chat, by the way.

1356
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,920
I appreciate it so much.

1357
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:07,760
Thank you.

1358
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,740
More demons.

1359
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:11,680
This...

1360
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,480
This is all Kratos doing.

1361
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,260
Kratos.

1362
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:20,560
Yeah.

1363
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:23,880
Yeah.

1364
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,120
Oh.

1365
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,420
D-d-d-d-d-duel!

1366
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:38,140
Oh, dead.

1367
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,600
Oh, these are the sword thingies.

1368
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:06,900
Grab it.

1369
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,440
Oh shoot.

1370
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1371
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:09,780
Oh gosh, they hurt a lot.

1372
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,540
They hurt a lot.

1373
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:13,380
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1374
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:13,980
Dang it.

1375
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,040
Oh my

1376
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:22,960
god.

1377
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:23,660
Oh, what's happening?

1378
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:27,460
Understood?

1379
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:28,460
Understandable?

1380
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,600
Please, let me grab him.

1381
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,320
Oh my gosh.

1382
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:36,800
Okay.

1383
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:38,560
That

1384
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:53,290
was close.

1385
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:02,630
Oh, oh gosh.

1386
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:03,690
Run, run, run, run.

1387
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,590
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1388
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,690
Oh, I don't have double.

1389
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:10,090
I don't have airhike.

1390
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:29,310
Health,

1391
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,930
health, health, health, health, health.

1392
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,050
Run, run, run, run, run.

1393
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:37,570
Ouch.

1394
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,490
Ouch.

1395
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,770
Wait, how do I avoid this?

1396
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:50,190
Oh, I think I should attack like while I'm in the air probably.

1397
01:21:55,070 --> 01:21:55,530
Ouch.

1398
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:56,830
You jerk.

1399
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:57,610
Ouch.

1400
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:02,310
Okay, okay.

1401
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,470
I might have to do this one again.

1402
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,250
That's okay though.

1403
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,240
Oh no, it still killed me.

1404
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,800
Oh, that sucks so bad.

1405
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,940
Or it still hurt me.

1406
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:20,060
Yeah.

1407
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:27,880
Run, run, run.

1408
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:28,600
Okay.

1409
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,260
Oh no,

1410
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:35,520
please.

1411
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,680
I'm gonna die.

1412
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,770
The middle part is safe from the shock?

1413
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:48,370
It is?

1414
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,830
Oh, I was wondering that.

1415
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,600
Okay, okay.

1416
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:58,500
All right.

1417
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,100
Run, I'll run, don't leave.

1418
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,260
I mean, gyro.

1419
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:17,980
I'm so sorry.

1420
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,100
I have...

1421
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:22,960
Oh shoot.

1422
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:27,520
Ouchie.

1423
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,220
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1424
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,480
Ouch, ouch, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1425
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,380
I didn't notice the...

1426
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,380
Oh gosh, there's so many of them.

1427
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,940
Oh, they're all coming after me.

1428
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:08,380
Ouch.

1429
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:23,880
What?

1430
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,020
Yeah!

1431
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,020
It took me a second to figure it out, but I got it.

1432
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,940
Thanks for telling me about the middle.

1433
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,440
That helped a lot.

1434
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:00,160
It has only been a few years since I began this research.

1435
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,180
He looks like Shigure Ui.

1436
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,940
Which is all hunched over.

1437
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,740
Have you guys seen those memes?

1438
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:07,980
They're cracking me up.

1439
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:14,680
It's the wish of His Holiness.

1440
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,300
What a crock.

1441
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,260
And you may as well ditch the efforts, pal.

1442
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,140
Because His Holiness is dead.

1443
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:26,960
Ah, but His Holiness has been reborn.

1444
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:27,920
Reborn?

1445
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:28,820
As an angel.

1446
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:29,980
Me?

1447
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,840
I don't know, that did not look very angelic.

1448
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,120
Oh no, he's doing the thing that I do to them.

1449
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,980
Oh, never mind.

1450
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:57,740
See, but just a small fraction of my research...

1451
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,340
Miro!

1452
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,480
Dante's gonna come save us, probably.

1453
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:06,620
Look, how beautiful this white armor stands.

1454
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:15,900
You have no idea the hardship to make just one armor come to life.

1455
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,200
Then why are there so many?

1456
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:24,000
I had to capture and control countless demons to harness their souls.

1457
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,480
Summoning them alone was almost an insurmountable task.

1458
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,160
They do look really nice, though.

1459
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:30,640
Summoning?

1460
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,940
So was you, who made the gate.

1461
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,420
Yes, yes, the Hell Gate.

1462
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:42,580
I created it merely as a reference and substitution for the real gate.

1463
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,420
But after utilizing an extremely powerful devil's arm...

1464
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,420
Yeah, they look really awesome.

1465
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,060
Kind of chunky.

1466
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:51,160
I like it chunky.

1467
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:51,840
It proves sufficient.

1468
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,920
What the hell are you talking about?

1469
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,320
I like them big.

1470
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,000
I like them chunky.

1471
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,280
You should rest.

1472
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:16,640
Soon, you shall be my next subject of experimentation.

1473
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,020
So that I can learn a little something from you.

1474
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,060
French toast, yummy.

1475
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,820
And that armor.

1476
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,060
I feel like I have to whisper because they're so quiet in this game.

1477
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,580
Never.

1478
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,360
Oh, yes.

1479
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:47,100
Take him out.

1480
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,660
I thought he was like...

1481
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,100
Take him out.

1482
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,020
On a date.

1483
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,400
No way.

1484
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,200
Oh my god, wait.

1485
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,260
Was I right?

1486
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:15,460
We're harnessing...

1487
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:30,420
Wait,

1488
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,040
what did I just miss?

1489
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,490
It's true form.

1490
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:53,830
Oh my god.

1491
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:55,290
Jojo.

1492
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:59,490
Wait, isn't Jiro...

1493
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,750
He's been a moth this whole time.

1494
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:06,210
Matarikon.

1495
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,970
Wait, he doesn't get a demon form, but he has a demon stand?

1496
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,670
That's insane.

1497
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:23,720
I

1498
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,160
didn't know DMC4 was a love story.

1499
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,920
They gave him boobs.

1500
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:49,400
Bye, Jojo.

1501
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,900
Agnus beef.

1502
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:21,710
Agnus.

1503
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:33,450
You must have known something.

1504
01:30:38,130 --> 01:30:38,770
Yamato.

1505
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,870
Oh, that's why some of you guys were saying Yamato.

1506
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:45,690
A sword imbued with tremendous power.

1507
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:48,070
It unleashes the latent power within Nero.

1508
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,090
Devil...

1509
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:57,750
Sorry, I swallowed my spit wrong.

1510
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:05,910
lol Press LB to release the demonic energy within Yamato and unleash the devil in Nero.

1511
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:08,950
Uh-oh.

1512
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:12,010
Now we have to start buying plorbs.

1513
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:14,670
We have wasted all...

1514
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:18,630
Well, I guess we didn't waste the money, but we spent all our money on plorbs.

1515
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:25,110
Within your deity gauge to transform and using this energy will deplete your gauge.

1516
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,830
Our thing is going crazy.

1517
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:31,390
Our arm, I mean.

1518
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,710
Can I destroy all this stuff for money?

1519
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:34,270
No?

1520
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,170
We plorbing now.

1521
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:37,310
Yeah, we got plorb.

1522
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:38,110
Oh!

1523
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:40,970
Destroy the research!

1524
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,610
Destroy for plorb!

1525
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:48,570
Destroy for plorb!

1526
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:49,170
No?

1527
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:49,570
Okay.

1528
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:01,410
I love that.

1529
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:05,490
Thank you.

1530
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,460
More...

1531
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,520
puzzle time.

1532
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:19,390
Yep, yep.

1533
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:27,210
Is this the puzzle?

1534
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:28,930
Yeah, we're like a quote puzzle.

1535
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:35,530
Oh!

1536
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:39,010
Whoa!

1537
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:40,430
We activated the dam.

1538
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,320
Whoa!

1539
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,960
Visuals in this game are great.

1540
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:53,560
Why did I do it one at a time?

1541
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:11,390
Okay.

1542
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:14,030
Oh.

1543
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:21,270
No, no.

1544
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:23,230
Right...

1545
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:23,490
There!

1546
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:25,170
There!

1547
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:27,170
Is it too short?

1548
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:28,170
No.

1549
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,020
Is my arm too short for it?

1550
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:36,860
Maybe...

1551
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,040
This one's hard, you need to jump.

1552
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:38,300
Okay.

1553
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,380
Thank you.

1554
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,720
I can't tell when I can't...

1555
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,140
My depth perception tends...

1556
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,520
It's once again becoming the final boss.

1557
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,020
I know I keep falling.

1558
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,380
I'm trying to jump.

1559
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,080
Why do I keep falling?

1560
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:18,020
Oh, don't jump off the side of the...

1561
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,380
Don't jump off the side, Nero.

1562
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,570
I guess I need to time it.

1563
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,130
He's a clumsy guy.

1564
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:32,350
Try doing stinger.

1565
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:35,670
Oh, like...

1566
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,130
Oh, okay.

1567
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:37,710
Okay, there we go.

1568
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,410
The camera.

1569
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:45,230
Ah, I didn't lock on.

1570
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:51,210
But that got me pretty...

1571
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,070
I know the camera change really does get me.

1572
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,130
Okay, that was...

1573
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:55,770
This was good though.

1574
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:58,130
Just kidding.

1575
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:58,450
Hello?

1576
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:00,630
Oh, I'm pressing that.

1577
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:01,530
That's why I'm stupid.

1578
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:08,090
We need the blorb.

1579
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,590
Yeah, we get good distance with it.

1580
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:12,750
Sorry, I'm gonna be really stubborn about this, guys.

1581
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:15,210
This is my new...

1582
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,150
Metal Gear Ration.

1583
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:21,370
You gotta let it out.

1584
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:25,550
Pull your devil trigger to embrace the darkness within you and move fast, baby.

1585
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:26,350
Don't be slow.

1586
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:27,370
Thank you.

1587
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:36,120
Jump towards it with streak.

1588
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,660
Wait, that's what I'm doing, right?

1589
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,020
I'm using streak.

1590
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:40,840
I'm been using...

1591
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,600
I'm doing streak.

1592
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,000
Oh, just try streaking instead.

1593
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:45,840
Oh.

1594
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:47,960
Ah!

1595
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:49,920
Oh!

1596
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,780
Oh, it's that far.

1597
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:54,780
Wow.

1598
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,900
Did I miss a birthday?

1599
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,680
Let her cook.

1600
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:00,700
Today's my birthday.

1601
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,580
Can I get a happy birthday song?

1602
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,460
Of course, Kodamushi!

1603
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,680
Happy birthday to you.

1604
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,840
Happy birthday to you.

1605
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,860
Happy birthday, Kodamushi.

1606
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,260
Happy birthday to you.

1607
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,880
Happy birthday!

1608
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,780
Happy, happy birthday.

1609
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:28,480
Fellow Minto.

1610
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:29,500
Mint-mine!

1611
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,320
Thank you for 10 bucks.

1612
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,100
All right, all right, all right.

1613
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,340
All right.

1614
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,320
Oh.

1615
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,920
That didn't...

1616
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,920
That wasn't effective at all.

1617
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,900
We're locked in.

1618
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:44,560
We're locked in.

1619
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,180
We're locked in.

1620
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:45,900
We're locked in.

1621
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:50,760
No.

1622
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,280
No, I need you to go forward.

1623
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:53,980
No!

1624
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,100
Not that way.

1625
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,140
I meant your other forward.

1626
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,390
I wish I had air hike right now.

1627
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:21,630
I wish I had air hike.

1628
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:23,650
This is putting down our...

1629
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:24,810
What's it called, you guys?

1630
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:30,370
It's putting down our time.

1631
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,670
I'm gonna get a lower score.

1632
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:35,910
Don't press grab.

1633
01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:36,950
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

1634
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,790
I'm just, I'm just streaking.

1635
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:39,470
I'm just streaking.

1636
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:40,490
I think I gotta...

1637
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:41,750
Okay, I gotta angle it though.

1638
01:37:42,330 --> 01:37:43,530
Oh my gosh!

1639
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:45,410
Why'd you go that way?

1640
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:48,310
Go to the right, please.

1641
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:50,830
I'm gonna start from over here.

1642
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:53,450
I wish I could change the camera, you know.

1643
01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:54,930
Okay, maybe like that.

1644
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:56,410
Why?

1645
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:58,390
Stop going that way.

1646
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,630
Stop going that way, please!

1647
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:06,990
One charge of rev intense.

1648
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,350
I don't think it's, I don't think it's...

1649
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:13,270
I think it's more so the...

1650
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,390
The angle.

1651
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:17,270
No?

1652
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:22,510
It's the angle rather than the distance, I think.

1653
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:26,750
See, like, this looks like it would be fine, no?

1654
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:27,950
But it keeps going.

1655
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,960
Okay, let's get the heck out of here.

1656
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:43,460
Yeah, see, oh, thank you whoever suggested streak instead of the grabby grab.

1657
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,740
That was way easier.

1658
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:47,620
Nice.

1659
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:47,720
Nice.

1660
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,920
All right.

1661
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,020
Whoa, that's a big wall.

1662
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,880
Who is it?

1663
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh, it's just you.

1664
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:11,780
Oucha, oucha.

1665
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,560
I'm glad the wall doesn't attack us anymore.

1666
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:20,780
Oh, oh, oucha.

1667
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:32,200
You have no sword to depend upon.

1668
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,080
Oh, oucha.

1669
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:52,370
Oh, DT's.

1670
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:53,550
Now we gotta try it.

1671
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:56,210
Another thing for me to remember.

1672
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,890
It's literally the game.

1673
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:00,790
What's that thing?

1674
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:02,010
Looks so cool.

1675
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:06,310
Um...

1676
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:10,090
Oh, there's people in there.

1677
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:11,170
Oh, there's a secret here.

1678
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:17,510
This is...

1679
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:23,850
Aiming into so you know grabs and DT are much stronger and you can spam gun during DT grabs.

1680
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:28,150
You can spam gun and grab.

1681
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:30,390
Tracking treasure down.

1682
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:31,690
Find all the hidden...

1683
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:33,950
This is speaking my language.

1684
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:37,590
Wait, we're going on a treasure hunt.

1685
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:43,810
A 99 of them.

1686
01:40:46,810 --> 01:40:49,470
Wait, maybe I'm bad at this.

1687
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:54,370
Wait...

1688
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:57,030
That's the door?

1689
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,260
That was the door.

1690
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,320
That was the door.

1691
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,240
So silly.

1692
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,900
That was so silly.

1693
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,480
GG speedrun.

1694
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,160
I'm guessing this is above?

1695
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:29,720
Okay, hold on.

1696
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,650
My all-time favorite food.

1697
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,510
Wait.

1698
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,630
Hold on.

1699
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:51,290
And I gotta concentrate.

1700
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:53,350
I don't really have an all-time favorite food.

1701
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,810
Wait.

1702
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:56,890
Stop moving?

1703
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:57,210
Oh.

1704
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:01,590
Is that what I'm doing wrong?

1705
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:02,990
Hold on, let me go back to this first one.

1706
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,980
When does it become the brightest it can be?

1707
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,640
Like this looks so bright.

1708
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,720
Maybe it's up above.

1709
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:04,680
Whack it.

1710
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:06,000
This thing?

1711
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:07,780
Wait, whack what?

1712
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:10,120
Oh, this thing.

1713
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,150
Oh, you guys are so...

1714
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,090
You guys are so smart.

1715
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:25,650
Okay, so there was three...

1716
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:27,750
So there was probably just one more that we needed to get.

1717
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,610
Okay, we can do this.

1718
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:30,150
We can do this.

1719
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:33,710
We can do this.

1720
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:34,230
We can do this.

1721
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:36,150
Thanks for the help.

1722
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:39,110
That was sneaky, huh?

1723
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,750
Okay, so there's this one first.

1724
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:43,490
They're like, you're gonna leave?

1725
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:45,190
Nah, JK.

1726
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:50,110
There's this one.

1727
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,590
Oh, there's not this one.

1728
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,370
Oh, is it random each time?

1729
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:04,830
Uh-oh.

1730
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:06,510
Uh-oh.

1731
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:08,510
I think it's random.

1732
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:09,190
Uh-oh.

1733
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:12,590
Uh-oh.

1734
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,330
I think it's random.

1735
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,700
Okay, not here.

1736
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,280
There was something over here.

1737
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:32,350
Maybe like here?

1738
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:33,390
No.

1739
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:34,510
Here?

1740
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:36,810
Do I go up even more?

1741
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:40,490
Time to panic.

1742
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,510
My strategy!

1743
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,550
My stride is completely lost.

1744
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:47,910
And so am I.

1745
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,860
Okay, let's go to the bounce.

1746
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,720
Unless it's down here.

1747
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,100
No, it's definitely not.

1748
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:07,750
There only is this level.

1749
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:11,210
Okay, we're gonna have to do it again.

1750
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,590
Attack the mirror.

1751
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:14,170
You think that's it?

1752
01:45:21,730 --> 01:45:22,970
Okay, we got that one.

1753
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,430
Okay.

1754
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,620
Wait, but there was something glowing on the other side.

1755
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,040
I wonder if you could duel the other one, maybe.

1756
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:48,160
Surely it being random means it can be brute force, no?

1757
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:49,800
No thinking required.

1758
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:53,560
Wow, we only have four seconds left!

1759
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:55,420
Craziness.

1760
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,780
Where'd the blorb spawn at?

1761
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,380
Oh, over here.

1762
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:02,420
Yippee!

1763
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:07,750
Yay!

1764
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:09,410
Wait, there's more here.

1765
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:13,470
Unless it's still reacting to this.

1766
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:15,410
I think it's still reacting to that.

1767
01:46:17,230 --> 01:46:17,790
Nice!

1768
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:20,010
Okay.

1769
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:20,350
Okay.

1770
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:26,470
Yummy blorb.

1771
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:27,830
I think we just need...

1772
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:28,310
Let's see.

1773
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:31,850
Yeah, we just need one more for another blorb piece.

1774
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:33,810
I need health desperately.

1775
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:37,990
I need health bad.

1776
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:48,090
Reminder about DT.

1777
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:49,430
Thank you, I'm gonna do it!

1778
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:50,570
Now.

1779
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:57,340
Oh, okay.

1780
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,320
I suck.

1781
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,640
Oh my gosh, it's so little.

1782
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,220
Where'd he go?

1783
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,660
So have I.

1784
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:32,880
Woo!

1785
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:45,290
The time has come, and so have I.

1786
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:50,390
We're going this way, right?

1787
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:51,030
Okay.

1788
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,710
Again!

1789
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:56,610
Again!

1790
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:56,990
Again!

1791
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:00,390
Buster is so cool.

1792
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:11,650
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

1793
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,470
Oh, there's so many of them!

1794
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,710
I'm scared of dying!

1795
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,420
Oh gosh, they're all revving.

1796
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:36,000
They're all revving.

1797
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:43,060
Ouch!

1798
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:49,180
Oh!

1799
01:48:59,300 --> 01:48:59,860
Nice.

1800
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,680
We got two for one.

1801
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:03,840
Very good.

1802
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,640
Oh, there we go.

1803
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,580
Oh my gosh, where'd that guy come from?

1804
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:13,380
I'm gonna die!

1805
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,300
I'm gonna die!

1806
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:15,720
DT!

1807
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,440
Okay, okay.

1808
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,380
Oh, I can't DT yet.

1809
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,060
Sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks.

1810
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:57,200
Okay.

1811
01:49:58,940 --> 01:50:00,480
Good thrusting, thank you.

1812
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:04,140
I didn't die, but I'm barely alive.

1813
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:06,540
Oh, what's around here?

1814
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:07,220
In here?

1815
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,640
What is it?

1816
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:17,120
Lots of robes, baby.

1817
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:17,900
Nice.

1818
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:22,280
This is the way.

1819
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:24,600
Is there anything over here?

1820
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:26,880
It doesn't seem to be.

1821
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:30,840
Taunt restores DT.

1822
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,660
Oh, we got a little bit of green.

1823
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:36,280
Oh, eat your greens, everybody.

1824
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,510
Could have been worse.

1825
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:58,210
Hold on, let's check this.

1826
01:50:59,470 --> 01:50:59,910
Nice.

1827
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:01,130
Please give me health!

1828
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:02,450
Please!

1829
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:03,550
I'm begging you!

1830
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:04,630
I'm on my knees!

1831
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:06,730
Please give me health!

1832
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:07,770
I'm begging, I'm begging, I'm begging!

1833
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:08,670
I'm on my knees!

1834
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:10,990
Begging please for some health!

1835
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:12,810
This is a tiny bit of green.

1836
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:16,290
Please, just a tiny little bit.

1837
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:19,670
No health.

1838
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:20,510
Sad.

1839
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:21,590
Sad.

1840
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:29,070
It's been nice knowing you guys.

1841
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:33,770
This is where we found the...

1842
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,190
Lord piece before.

1843
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:39,530
I-I-R-C.

1844
01:51:46,730 --> 01:51:50,230
Please, please, please.

1845
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:52,790
Just a little green.

1846
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:59,990
I like how so many of these songs sound very similar.

1847
01:52:02,230 --> 01:52:04,730
But they're like different at the same time.

1848
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:13,490
I got it though.

1849
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,950
So we have a DT now.

1850
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:22,690
My arm is still glow- Oh, it's glowing because of this.

1851
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:23,070
That's right.

1852
01:52:27,150 --> 01:52:27,690
Um...

1853
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:29,290
Was there something we couldn't do?

1854
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:32,590
Because we didn't have a DT before?

1855
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:39,150
We got that down.

1856
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:44,930
Hold on one second.

1857
01:52:45,170 --> 01:52:46,390
My chat froze again.

1858
01:52:50,870 --> 01:52:52,210
Buy more porbs.

1859
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,590
I can do that.

1860
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:57,470
Oh, wait.

1861
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:04,310
He's like, the guy's watching from the window as I destroy this.

1862
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:07,490
He's just like a single tear coming down his face.

1863
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:10,690
He's like, I just, I'm in, he's like, I'm in hell.

1864
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:12,530
I just put those back.

1865
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:18,510
He's like, today I'm gonna discover the scoundrels.

1866
01:53:18,530 --> 01:53:20,570
That keep stealing our chairs.

1867
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:24,210
He keeps destroying them.

1868
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:27,270
Not again.

1869
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:29,690
It's literally- Hold on, I'm trying to fix my chat.

1870
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:30,130
Sorry, guys.

1871
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:34,490
It's literally one of those moments of the cabbage guy from Avatar.

1872
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,050
Kids these days.

1873
01:53:41,230 --> 01:53:45,030
And then you see- It's just Nero's got a lot of aggression, you know?

1874
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:46,870
He's just really gotta let it out.

1875
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:52,840
Oh!

1876
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,540
We cannot buy P.O.R.B.

1877
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:55,980
yet.

1878
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,340
How curious.

1879
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:03,820
I guess starting the next- The next mission from forward?

1880
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:14,620
Hold on.

1881
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,040
Please refresh.

1882
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,640
I'm begging you.

1883
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,140
Sneaky blorb.

1884
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:30,010
She can't see us.

1885
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:30,650
I can!

1886
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:32,110
Kind of.

1887
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:33,670
I have to read you through OBS.

1888
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:40,650
Guys, I am once again asking for a hint on where to go.

1889
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:46,990
Shall we dance?

1890
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:47,670
Shall- Oh!

1891
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:48,110
It worked!

1892
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:48,550
I worked!

1893
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:49,250
Okay.

1894
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,850
Second floor doors.

1895
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:54,730
Thank you!

1896
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:57,150
Thank you, thank you.

1897
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:07,810
Does it matter which one?

1898
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,780
What are we glowing about, huh?

1899
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:20,400
Is it this?

1900
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,860
Oh my gosh!

1901
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,320
We got a blorb!

1902
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,360
Full health, baby!

1903
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:39,260
Oh my gosh!

1904
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,060
Nice!

1905
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:43,080
Oh, nice!

1906
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,900
Wait, do you guys see that over there?

1907
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:49,820
Does this one also?

1908
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,220
Is there even a mirror over here?

1909
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:53,780
Maybe not.

1910
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,200
Oh, there is.

1911
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:59,800
Now I'm just destroying- My arm's not even glowing.

1912
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,420
I'm just destroying this to be a menace.

1913
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:05,140
Oh, it's- There's nothing even behind it!

1914
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:10,180
But do you guys see that thing?

1915
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,540
Can I grab that?

1916
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:13,940
Oh!

1917
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,720
Oh my gosh!

1918
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,340
I'm finding everything right now!

1919
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:18,440
Nice!

1920
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,400
Okay, now we'll go through the door.

1921
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,120
Oh, that's not the door.

1922
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,560
Now we'll go through the door.

1923
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,160
Real.

1924
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,600
Oh, we're in here!

1925
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:38,910
Yeah!

1926
01:56:58,580 --> 01:56:59,280
Oh!

1927
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:06,950
Slam dunk!

1928
01:57:08,450 --> 01:57:11,770
Oh, he had like one measly health left.

1929
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:28,070
I'm not letting you do anything that you wanna do!

1930
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:32,790
I hate chairs!

1931
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:33,590
I hate chairs!

1932
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:35,590
Oh, I forgot that I can use this thing too!

1933
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:40,500
Anything else?

1934
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:40,760
Alright.

1935
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,500
I hope I'm going the right way.

1936
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:48,420
Bullying them.

1937
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:50,800
This is the wrong place?

1938
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:51,080
Oh.

1939
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:51,980
Ow.

1940
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:52,700
Thank you.

1941
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:53,880
Oh, shoot.

1942
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:54,760
We'll just run.

1943
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,280
Wrong way.

1944
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:11,900
I'm almost positive those doors made a loop, no?

1945
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,580
This one?

1946
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:18,160
Door next to the painting.

1947
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,320
Painting.

1948
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,800
Door next to the portrait.

1949
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:25,380
But there's two of them.

1950
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:27,800
This one?

1951
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:30,860
The loop doors.

1952
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:32,480
Either work?

1953
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:32,700
Okay.

1954
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:34,660
Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

1955
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:46,900
I fear the game does not do a great job of telling you where to go.

1956
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:49,680
Oh!

1957
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:52,340
Come here!

1958
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,540
Or maybe it does, and I'm just not paying attention.

1959
01:58:58,600 --> 01:58:59,780
Am I just not paying enough attention?

1960
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:03,000
There is a map.

1961
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,540
Yeah, but does the map tell you where to go?

1962
01:59:19,610 --> 01:59:20,990
Slam dunk, baby!

1963
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:33,850
Waterfall.

1964
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:41,910
Hold on.

1965
01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:43,730
I want to get a good styles.

1966
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:46,370
There we go.

1967
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:51,890
It's been a week since you saw it.

1968
01:59:52,170 --> 01:59:52,930
Oh, it has, yeah.

1969
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:55,570
I have many game on the brain, too.

1970
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:02,030
Many game on the brain.

1971
02:00:03,330 --> 02:00:03,910
I'll be honest, I don't know how many games I have on the brain.

1972
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,730
Does this want me to DT and use it?

1973
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,860
I don't want to waste it, though.

1974
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:15,000
No?

1975
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:15,440
Okay.

1976
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,600
I've been playing a lot of Ground Zeroes.

1977
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:24,500
That's been on my mind the most.

1978
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:27,020
Oh, we made it!

1979
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:33,330
Does that red thing do anything?

1980
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:42,340
Oh, well, I should have checked it.

1981
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:56,230
All right, oh.

1982
02:00:59,130 --> 02:01:00,630
Forward we go.

1983
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:03,730
Forest entrance?

1984
02:01:05,370 --> 02:01:06,710
It was a fan.

1985
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:10,270
I'm going into a forest?

1986
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,230
Oh my gosh.

1987
02:01:18,890 --> 02:01:19,690
Whoa!

1988
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,130
Whoa, I'm in the jungle!

1989
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:24,130
Any minkies about?

1990
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:29,270
This is the most green I've ever seen in these games, ever.

1991
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:35,450
Oh my gosh, just would imagine Snake coming down doing his...

1992
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,130
What the hell?

1993
02:01:36,210 --> 02:01:37,750
This looks just like it.

1994
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:41,810
This is like where Snake finishes his Halo jump.

1995
02:01:42,210 --> 02:01:44,330
What the hell is this?

1996
02:01:50,570 --> 02:01:51,630
Sorry, kid.

1997
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:53,390
This is gonna have to wait.

1998
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:57,890
Where did he come from?

1999
02:01:58,410 --> 02:01:59,590
Where is he going?

2000
02:02:01,950 --> 02:02:03,610
What the hell is this?

2001
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:06,750
How much could he really know?

2002
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:09,790
More than you, little baby.

2003
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:19,840
Oh my goodness.

2004
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:21,980
Thank you.

2005
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,520
Oh wait, we got a ton of points this time.

2006
02:02:34,060 --> 02:02:36,200
We got a lot of points this time.

2007
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,100
Let's go!

2008
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:39,500
Cab.

2009
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,420
Turn it up, turn it.

2010
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:02,160
Oops.

2011
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:04,480
Why is that lady from before?

2012
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:05,260
The plot.

2013
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,380
A million memes of Dante looking at various things.

2014
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,260
I believe it.

2015
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:28,740
Booba booba.

2016
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,260
Booba booba.

2017
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,380
Who's the other cloaked creature?

2018
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,740
Who is that guy?

2019
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:55,160
She's got...

2020
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,140
Wow!

2021
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:57,260
Wow!

2022
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:01,100
She's got boobs.

2023
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,360
Ooh, they're talking about you.

2024
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,700
Ooh, maybe it should have like...

2025
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:26,540
Maybe it should have waited a little longer.

2026
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:30,500
No,

2027
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:36,580
they're gossiping.

2028
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:40,500
They didn't even give her time to leave the room before they gossiped.

2029
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,500
Yeah, what is he investigating, huh?

2030
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:51,560
That menace, Nero, appears to be quite close to Kratos' sister, Kyrie.

2031
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:55,180
More than once, he called out her name.

2032
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:02,900
They're gonna use the girl.

2033
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,360
They're gonna use the girl mission.

2034
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:07,420
The She-Viper.

2035
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:10,100
Proceed through the Forest of Ruin.

2036
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:15,930
Evil Pope smile.

2037
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:20,350
I mean, don't believe she's here.

2038
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:22,870
Ah, Edith P!

2039
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,240
Thank you!

2040
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:30,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2041
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:33,800
Viper?

2042
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,180
Snake?

2043
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:37,060
I've been called a viper once.

2044
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:38,300
All right.

2045
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,400
Oh, no!

2046
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:45,340
Oh, no!

2047
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:47,340
Wait a second.

2048
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,560
I might be able to get the trigger heart, though.

2049
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:53,820
Hold on, let's see if we can get both.

2050
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:54,660
Abilities?

2051
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,540
Air hike?

2052
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:02,250
I can't.

2053
02:06:03,070 --> 02:06:03,910
I thought I had...

2054
02:06:03,910 --> 02:06:05,430
I thought it cost less than it did.

2055
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,140
Still waiting for mine.

2056
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,360
It might be...

2057
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:13,320
It might depend on which batch you got it...

2058
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,800
your plushie from.

2059
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,760
Because there was...

2060
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,880
They did have to do a second batch.

2061
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:21,060
And those will be shipped around July.

2062
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,160
If I remember correctly.

2063
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,120
So...

2064
02:06:29,950 --> 02:06:31,950
Apologies if you have to wait a little longer.

2065
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:32,630
I'm sorry.

2066
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:36,650
Maximum bet and show...

2067
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:36,770
Oh.

2068
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:38,750
Maximum bet.

2069
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:45,210
When the devil trigger is active while on the ground, press R, B, back, Y, B.

2070
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:50,290
Yamato and the Red Queen combine to take on all foes.

2071
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,650
Charging the attack will increase its power.

2072
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:55,030
So...

2073
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:56,310
You lock on.

2074
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:58,830
Then you press Y and B.

2075
02:07:08,230 --> 02:07:09,390
And then show down.

2076
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:15,690
When devil trigger is active while on the ground, press R, B, forward.

2077
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:17,450
Oh, so it's the same, but forward and backward.

2078
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:22,330
Nero himself unleashes Yamato with an omnipotent barrage of slashes.

2079
02:07:22,850 --> 02:07:24,290
Whoa, that looks insane.

2080
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:28,250
Oh my goodness.

2081
02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:29,330
We'll have to save up.

2082
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:31,850
I do want the trigger heart mostest.

2083
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:36,910
But right now, we will...

2084
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:40,930
We'll stick with double jump.

2085
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:42,630
We'll stick with air hike.

2086
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,890
We might be able to get enough in the next thing.

2087
02:07:46,190 --> 02:07:46,510
We'll see.

2088
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:49,570
Oh, wait.

2089
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:52,270
I don't think I can get anything else.

2090
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:53,930
Oh, there's the porb!

2091
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:55,370
We can get porb.

2092
02:07:57,370 --> 02:08:00,310
We're porbin', we're porbin', we're porbin', we're porbin'.

2093
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:01,750
What?

2094
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:02,430
It's good.

2095
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:09,560
Nice.

2096
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:10,920
Nice, nice.

2097
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:11,800
Oh, and then we can...

2098
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:12,760
Oh, I was like...

2099
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,860
I was like, wow, it feels like they added a ton more stuff.

2100
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:16,900
Yeah, because they added the double stars.

2101
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:18,820
Yes.

2102
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:21,740
Yeah, DT is useful now.

2103
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:22,500
I know, right?

2104
02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:23,720
We can actually use it now.

2105
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:24,660
Nice.

2106
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:25,140
All right.

2107
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:28,360
Wow,

2108
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:35,460
what a peaceful forest.

2109
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:36,200
Ooh!

2110
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:38,980
Ew!

2111
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:42,120
What are these?

2112
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:45,040
Let me turn it down a little bit, sorry.

2113
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:47,120
I keep turning it up during the cutscenes.

2114
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,660
This looks ominous, no?

2115
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,420
If I stop moving...

2116
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:58,840
Not the jungle music.

2117
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:09,660
Whoa!

2118
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:12,940
Oh my gosh, you sent that donut at the same time that it exploded.

2119
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:14,580
And so I thought it was...

2120
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:15,280
I heard, like...

2121
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,980
I heard just barely within the screams, like...

2122
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:22,640
Nero hitting chairs is such a good joke that I'm still laughing.

2123
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:25,480
It will make sense in DMC5.

2124
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,140
Mint Jimbo does it again.

2125
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:27,440
Really?

2126
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:33,340
I should be a game dev.

2127
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,920
I would create the most cursed thing ever.

2128
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:38,680
Okay.

2129
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:41,420
Onwards through the jungle.

2130
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:46,640
In the jungle, the mighty jungle.

2131
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:49,900
The Nero sleeps tonight.

2132
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:54,980
Oh, in the jungle.

2133
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:55,640
Oh.

2134
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:58,520
Oh, he's so tiny down there.

2135
02:09:58,820 --> 02:10:00,040
What is that thing?

2136
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:03,720
He's just creepy crawling.

2137
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:05,760
Oh, there's a couple of them.

2138
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:07,220
Creepy crawlers.

2139
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:12,520
Hold on, guys.

2140
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:14,460
I gotta get my stuff first.

2141
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,840
Little ants down there.

2142
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:24,240
Oh, I'm watching from up here.

2143
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:11,050
I'm so chill right now.

2144
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,680
I need my skin.

2145
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:37,910
Hold on, I saw some little eggies on the wall.

2146
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:39,810
If I go this way...

2147
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:41,050
Oh, here one.

2148
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:42,790
How do I get that guy?

2149
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:45,390
No, like...

2150
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:45,730
No.

2151
02:11:48,390 --> 02:11:48,870
Maybe...

2152
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:49,710
There we go.

2153
02:11:53,670 --> 02:11:54,150
Eww!

2154
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:56,430
Bug, bug, bug, bug, bug, bug.

2155
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:57,990
Bug, bug, bug.

2156
02:11:59,090 --> 02:11:59,570
Bug.

2157
02:12:00,510 --> 02:12:00,970
Bug!

2158
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:02,110
Oh, I squished him.

2159
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:03,510
Oh, I squished him again.

2160
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:18,400
Nasty.

2161
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:22,260
I like how I'm losing...

2162
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:25,480
I'm like technically losing points as I'm vibing to the music.

2163
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:28,030
But it's just hard not to just, you know...

2164
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:30,760
Take it all in for a little bit, you know?

2165
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:36,120
The time is coming, so have I.

2166
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:42,700
Let's try in here.

2167
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:44,160
Ah,

2168
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:49,910
these guys.

2169
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:51,930
These clowns again.

2170
02:12:52,670 --> 02:12:53,930
Literal clowns.

2171
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:56,730
Oh, friendly fire.

2172
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:59,310
Oh, is he possessing it?

2173
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:03,930
Oh my gosh!

2174
02:13:04,650 --> 02:13:05,410
Last of us.

2175
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:28,360
Easy mode.

2176
02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:32,340
Nastyness.

2177
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:33,720
That was so gross.

2178
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:35,480
There's a whole egg.

2179
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:36,140
Egg area.

2180
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:38,640
Wait.

2181
02:13:40,340 --> 02:13:41,620
Let me in!

2182
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:45,320
Look at all those eggs!

2183
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:47,100
I gotta crack them.

2184
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:53,000
What the heck are these supposed to be?

2185
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:54,640
Ducks?

2186
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:56,980
Hit it harder?

2187
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:57,540
Yeah!

2188
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:57,880
Oh!

2189
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,070
You're right!

2190
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:08,250
You're so right!

2191
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:08,410
Hey!

2192
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:11,270
Hey!

2193
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,090
Hey!

2194
02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:19,850
Just like the gla- the mirrors.

2195
02:14:21,490 --> 02:14:22,770
Look at the middle one too.

2196
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:28,270
I hate property!

2197
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:34,730
Insurance companies hate him.

2198
02:14:34,990 --> 02:14:37,390
Actually, would they hate him or would they love him?

2199
02:14:40,730 --> 02:14:44,690
They're always having to do payouts because of- because of him.

2200
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:45,910
Right?

2201
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:50,710
They would hate him.

2202
02:14:58,070 --> 02:14:59,330
That's a little icky.

2203
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:07,300
Can I jump over it?

2204
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:08,780
No.

2205
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:13,900
Aha!

2206
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:13,940
Ah!

2207
02:15:35,590 --> 02:15:36,870
Sad door.

2208
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:43,890
How much do you like jumping puzzles in DMC?

2209
02:15:46,710 --> 02:15:48,130
The most amount.

2210
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:52,510
The most amount that you can love a jumping puzzle, no?

2211
02:15:57,460 --> 02:15:58,340
Oh boy.

2212
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,460
This isn't so bad though.

2213
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:02,900
These are fine.

2214
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:05,780
Does it get worse?

2215
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:12,200
You'll love the next part.

2216
02:16:23,030 --> 02:16:24,110
Oh geez.

2217
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:31,560
Oh.

2218
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:33,460
Oh no!

2219
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,080
Wait!

2220
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:36,020
Ah, ouch!

2221
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:42,620
Do I have to kill them to progress?

2222
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:44,280
Oh.

2223
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:51,440
That was so close.

2224
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:01,150
Please!

2225
02:17:01,490 --> 02:17:02,710
Give me the next part!

2226
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:24,060
Please just- Ah, no, no, no!

2227
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,320
I need to kill these guys, like actually.

2228
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,440
Oh my god, no, please.

2229
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:32,840
No!

2230
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:39,560
No!

2231
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:40,340
Yeah, get lost please.

2232
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:41,580
I'm just gonna kill him like this.

2233
02:17:43,460 --> 02:17:44,540
Oh, no, no, no!

2234
02:17:47,560 --> 02:17:48,580
Where are my ghosts?

2235
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:49,140
A ghost!

2236
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:53,200
Oh.

2237
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:27,150
Charged shot is really good against the ghosts, is it?

2238
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:36,100
Ah!

2239
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:42,420
I think I did pretty all right maneuvering around- Oh, dang it, I did not mean to do that.

2240
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:46,000
I did all right maneuvering around them until I couldn't anymore though.

2241
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,000
Okay, all right.

2242
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:56,600
You can shoot- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you.

2243
02:18:56,760 --> 02:18:57,840
Well, grabbing indeed.

2244
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,340
I'm just gonna shoot them anyway.

2245
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:10,590
Ouch!

2246
02:19:12,990 --> 02:19:14,270
They suck so much.

2247
02:19:14,410 --> 02:19:15,710
Oh, you know what?

2248
02:19:19,890 --> 02:19:20,370
Ouch!

2249
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:23,070
Am I not supposed to be in DT right now?

2250
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:33,880
Oh,

2251
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:44,880
I hate these guys so much.

2252
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:46,040
Please, no more of you.

2253
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:47,520
Please, no more!

2254
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:50,520
Please, I'm so done with you!

2255
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:50,900
Please!

2256
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:51,060
Please!

2257
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:58,020
I don't want to deal with you anymore, but I can't leave until I finish defeating you guys.

2258
02:21:06,020 --> 02:21:06,900
Oh yeah.

2259
02:21:09,300 --> 02:21:09,740
I

2260
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:20,140
think the other guy is lower on health, but it's okay.

2261
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:24,180
Maybe I can get him like this.

2262
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,080
Yeah.

2263
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,320
It's a pretty lame way to die, but whatever.

2264
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:37,360
Okay.

2265
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:45,340
Okay.

2266
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:48,280
TMC2 skills live on.

2267
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:53,580
There's a cheese way?

2268
02:21:54,460 --> 02:21:55,200
What is that?

2269
02:21:55,560 --> 02:21:56,580
What's that cheese?

2270
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:02,300
What's the cheese?

2271
02:22:06,310 --> 02:22:07,710
There's a blorb on the platform.

2272
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:08,850
Is it that thing up there?

2273
02:22:10,170 --> 02:22:11,030
Is that the blorb?

2274
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:13,310
I thought that was one of the grabby grabs.

2275
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:21,350
I have a question for this part.

2276
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:23,450
If I kill them both, do they respawn?

2277
02:22:24,310 --> 02:22:25,910
So is it just kind of like outliving?

2278
02:22:26,530 --> 02:22:27,210
Or is it...

2279
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:30,150
If I kill them, they're gone.

2280
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:33,450
That's a blorb up there.

2281
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:34,710
I gotta get it.

2282
02:22:35,370 --> 02:22:36,510
So they don't respawn.

2283
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:40,410
Okay, they stay dead.

2284
02:22:41,390 --> 02:22:42,450
Okay, okay, okay.

2285
02:22:43,250 --> 02:22:44,270
They're just hard to kill.

2286
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:44,910
They are!

2287
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:46,050
They are very difficult.

2288
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:48,790
Especially when you're stressing out over...

2289
02:22:51,990 --> 02:22:52,550
over...

2290
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:55,690
over making it to the next platform.

2291
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,700
Start the platforms and don't move!

2292
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:07,940
Really?

2293
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,900
No, these will definitely go away, no?

2294
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:14,080
Oh.

2295
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:24,740
Oh.

2296
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:28,740
Jump on and jump back?

2297
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:29,560
Oh really?

2298
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:32,620
Uh, I missed my chance.

2299
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:36,920
Now I'll get to see what it does though.

2300
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:39,460
And it goes around in a...

2301
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:42,100
What is it?

2302
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:42,800
Where does it go?

2303
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:44,380
I'm observing.

2304
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:48,380
Get on the spawn first.

2305
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:49,060
My bad.

2306
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:51,740
My bad.

2307
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:56,480
Wait, but when I restart it, will they not then respawn or no?

2308
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:01,500
Blorb!

2309
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:02,960
That's our chance to get the blorb.

2310
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:03,940
They don't?

2311
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:05,920
Oh, interesting.

2312
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:06,400
Okay.

2313
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:09,960
IDK.

2314
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:10,780
IDK.

2315
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:15,020
Okay.

2316
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:22,270
Only one way to find out.

2317
02:24:22,390 --> 02:24:23,030
Yeah, I guess so.

2318
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:27,570
Okay, then it becomes a long pathway over there.

2319
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:37,280
The blorb is taunting me.

2320
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:46,280
Alrighty.

2321
02:24:59,620 --> 02:25:00,640
Come here!

2322
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:17,570
Only one appeared.

2323
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:25,090
Hmm.

2324
02:25:25,530 --> 02:25:25,830
Hmm.

2325
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:29,490
Where did the second one go?

2326
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:36,030
That didn't go out far enough?

2327
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:36,490
Uh-oh.

2328
02:25:37,390 --> 02:25:40,110
Well, I guess we'll see what happens.

2329
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:43,210
Oh, I have to wait the whole way.

2330
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:44,490
I'm sorry guys.

2331
02:25:46,670 --> 02:25:48,490
Okay, I gotta get on the second platform.

2332
02:25:48,690 --> 02:25:49,790
Okay, sorry guys.

2333
02:25:49,910 --> 02:25:50,590
Sorry for the wait.

2334
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:53,930
Um, bathroom break?

2335
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:54,410
I don't know.

2336
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:58,290
Bathroom break time.

2337
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:01,290
I have people messaging me.

2338
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:02,150
What are they saying?

2339
02:26:03,170 --> 02:26:04,230
What's going on?

2340
02:26:21,460 --> 02:26:26,760
Mogu was like, I can't believe I experienced my first doomed yaoi with Irving and Bert in Severance.

2341
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:32,300
Was MGS4 not doomed enough for you?

2342
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:35,140
Oh, it's over.

2343
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:35,580
Okay, good.

2344
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:41,580
Was that not doomed enough for you?

2345
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:49,200
Ah, second platform.

2346
02:27:09,230 --> 02:27:09,750
Yippee!

2347
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:18,020
Oh, oh my gosh.

2348
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:19,020
That was so close.

2349
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:20,220
Holy moly.

2350
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:23,180
Holy moly, that was so close.

2351
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:25,460
Oh god, I got too excited.

2352
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:32,920
Yeah, okay.

2353
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:34,980
All right.

2354
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:36,400
All right.

2355
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:43,200
You can kind of see which ones are about to change because they turn blue.

2356
02:27:43,820 --> 02:27:44,780
So that's kind of nice.

2357
02:27:48,580 --> 02:27:49,340
They start...

2358
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:49,960
Yeah, you see him?

2359
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:50,360
You see him?

2360
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:52,260
No.

2361
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:54,560
Like that.

2362
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:58,060
This is so easy.

2363
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:01,700
Yippee!

2364
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:04,160
This is so chill.

2365
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:07,720
Yippee!

2366
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:13,520
Yippee!

2367
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:15,140
Lapis River.

2368
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:18,300
Fancy.

2369
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:24,740
That was just a nice little stroll.

2370
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:26,960
No biggie.

2371
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:29,040
NBD, NBD.

2372
02:28:32,380 --> 02:28:34,200
Oh, we got more of these.

2373
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:39,320
Okay, I'll have to figure out a way to take care of those later.

2374
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:41,960
Mini...

2375
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:43,920
Camera change.

2376
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:51,110
Roar.

2377
02:28:53,830 --> 02:28:54,430
What's here?

2378
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:56,430
What's here?

2379
02:28:56,670 --> 02:28:58,210
Oh, I see it, I see it, I see it.

2380
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:02,270
What's this one?

2381
02:29:02,970 --> 02:29:04,010
Jungle parts are nice.

2382
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:05,170
Secret mission.

2383
02:29:05,350 --> 02:29:07,610
Reach the goal by rising to the top.

2384
02:29:09,170 --> 02:29:10,870
Don't do this mission, it's hard.

2385
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:12,390
Good luck with the secret.

2386
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:14,970
I kind of want to see it, but if it's hard, let's try it.

2387
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:17,590
Wait, this is a safe one.

2388
02:29:17,850 --> 02:29:18,130
Wait.

2389
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:20,550
I'm getting mixed messages.

2390
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:33,100
Oh,

2391
02:29:58,950 --> 02:29:59,410
uh...

2392
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:01,250
I'm not gonna make it.

2393
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:05,190
Do I go like here?

2394
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:20,080
This one seems doable, I'm not gonna lie.

2395
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:27,600
Wait, aim for under the fence.

2396
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:31,340
Go under the fence.

2397
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:32,460
Really?

2398
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:35,140
This one seems doable, maybe.

2399
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:46,840
As long as they're not about pure skill, I feel a little bit more confident.

2400
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:50,600
Under the fence.

2401
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:53,020
I'm on the fence, everybody.

2402
02:30:58,570 --> 02:30:59,490
Oh, oops.

2403
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:05,210
I wish the camera angles didn't mess me up.

2404
02:31:05,990 --> 02:31:07,810
I don't think I can go under the fence.

2405
02:31:10,590 --> 02:31:11,030
Ah!

2406
02:31:11,810 --> 02:31:13,310
Oh, I was so close!

2407
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:15,610
You guys saw that, right?

2408
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:24,410
I'm not gonna make it.

2409
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:26,270
I can't see!

2410
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:36,180
No!

2411
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:49,320
The grabby grabs are so inconsistent.

2412
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:58,160
So close.

2413
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,200
That was the last jump?

2414
02:31:59,280 --> 02:31:59,900
No way.

2415
02:32:00,100 --> 02:32:01,220
Okay, we can try it one more time.

2416
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:04,540
Do you mind doing it again?

2417
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:05,240
I will.

2418
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:08,060
Oh my gosh, Lord Krosus, I didn't even recognize you.

2419
02:32:09,760 --> 02:32:11,060
I didn't even recognize you.

2420
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:12,500
Change your profile picture.

2421
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:16,080
Why do you guys do that?

2422
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:19,100
Why do you guys change your profile picture so I can't recognize you?

2423
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:23,180
I love the camera in DMC.

2424
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:25,320
Oh, that's everybody's favorite part, no?

2425
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:28,660
Oh my gosh.

2426
02:32:28,780 --> 02:32:30,840
Oh, the camera really screwed me over there.

2427
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:36,460
Please, why is it doing this?

2428
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:37,900
Oh my god.

2429
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:42,340
Why is it suddenly messing up camera angle?

2430
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:50,040
Why is it suddenly like this?

2431
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:16,450
I wish I could restart the mission from here, honestly.

2432
02:33:17,690 --> 02:33:20,110
So I don't have to go through everything again.

2433
02:33:20,670 --> 02:33:22,550
Why is it acting like this?

2434
02:33:23,250 --> 02:33:24,250
I don't understand.

2435
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:26,790
I'm not changing anything.

2436
02:33:28,550 --> 02:33:30,150
Oh my gosh, it's...

2437
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:31,130
Okay, here's what's happening.

2438
02:33:31,450 --> 02:33:34,750
I'm pressing right on my joy-con.

2439
02:33:35,290 --> 02:33:36,390
Not joy-con.

2440
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:37,550
This is not a switch.

2441
02:33:37,750 --> 02:33:38,890
Oh my god, on my...

2442
02:33:38,890 --> 02:33:40,090
Oh, I can't.

2443
02:33:40,750 --> 02:33:42,370
My brain is frying.

2444
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:50,810
Joy-con.

2445
02:33:55,610 --> 02:33:57,990
The analog stick, yes.

2446
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:05,420
It's because I played on this switch before.

2447
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:08,460
When I was playing the first...

2448
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,660
The first three.

2449
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:13,420
Please!

2450
02:34:17,640 --> 02:34:18,240
Please!

2451
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:21,960
I can't tell where I'm at.

2452
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:29,280
I hate this mission.

2453
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:30,320
I don't want to do it anymore.

2454
02:34:32,400 --> 02:34:34,080
I don't want to do it anymore.

2455
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:36,740
The camera angle is making me so mad.

2456
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:38,440
I can't.

2457
02:34:38,660 --> 02:34:39,940
I don't want to do it anymore.

2458
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:48,580
Oh yeah, the door.

2459
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:49,380
Let's just leave.

2460
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,580
The camera angle is making me so angry.

2461
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:03,040
That's what was making it difficult.

2462
02:35:05,060 --> 02:35:07,140
Oh, I was gonna say, any rorbs down here?

2463
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,840
I knew I would be right.

2464
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:18,900
I think that's all our rorbs in this area.

2465
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,760
A little bit of health, nice.

2466
02:35:26,820 --> 02:35:27,500
We'll take it.

2467
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:27,740
Oh!

2468
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:28,640
Big!

2469
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:33,120
Nice.

2470
02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:38,620
Ew, what was gonna hatch out of that sucker, I wonder?

2471
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:47,980
Well, I almost did it.

2472
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:50,720
We take those.

2473
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:52,540
We take the almosts.

2474
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:54,660
Ancient Plaza.

2475
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:00,400
White Orb.

2476
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:02,920
A magic white stone of crystallized devil spirit.

2477
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:04,620
Revives lost magic power.

2478
02:36:06,720 --> 02:36:07,320
Nice.

2479
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:09,240
Is that basically a devil star?

2480
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:13,680
Warb!

2481
02:36:17,800 --> 02:36:18,660
Oh no.

2482
02:36:32,750 --> 02:36:34,650
Oh no, it transformed!

2483
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:40,470
More?

2484
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:49,090
Did you get possessed?

2485
02:36:49,910 --> 02:36:50,850
No, you're fine.

2486
02:36:51,730 --> 02:36:52,970
No possession on you.

2487
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:57,790
Oh, there's more?

2488
02:36:59,410 --> 02:36:59,730
Oh!

2489
02:36:59,910 --> 02:37:00,150
Oh!

2490
02:37:00,410 --> 02:37:01,210
Oh, they're hatching!

2491
02:37:05,170 --> 02:37:06,010
Yeah!

2492
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:08,510
Destroy them before they hatch!

2493
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:12,250
Ew!

2494
02:37:18,510 --> 02:37:19,350
Ew!

2495
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:22,610
Spawn kill!

2496
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:24,850
Oh.

2497
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:26,910
Nice.

2498
02:37:28,090 --> 02:37:29,910
Turn him into an omelette.

2499
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:33,910
Uh, you gotta crush a couple of eggs.

2500
02:37:34,390 --> 02:37:35,930
Wait, what's this one?

2501
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:37,190
Uh, Raiden!

2502
02:37:38,350 --> 02:37:39,950
So I'll make an omelette.

2503
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:41,390
You gotta...

2504
02:37:43,290 --> 02:37:46,290
You gotta squash the eggs.

2505
02:37:48,190 --> 02:37:50,250
What's this artist trying to say?

2506
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:55,650
You can't keep getting upset.

2507
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:58,050
Just...

2508
02:38:00,190 --> 02:38:02,130
About the eggs.

2509
02:38:08,810 --> 02:38:10,800
Am I doing it right?

2510
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:23,760
But

2511
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,500
what is it actually?

2512
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:40,200
Oh, can't fret over every egg, uh, Raiden.

2513
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,040
Woo!

2514
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:48,460
We're gonna do this thing.

2515
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:54,140
Oh,

2516
02:38:57,240 --> 02:38:57,820
so close.

2517
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:59,500
Almost got the double hitter.

2518
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:00,700
Wait, what did I just...

2519
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:01,840
What did I just kill?

2520
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:06,020
Oh, he's behind the...

2521
02:39:06,020 --> 02:39:06,800
He's behind the wall.

2522
02:39:10,060 --> 02:39:10,460
Uh-oh.

2523
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:16,160
Wait, crap!

2524
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:17,360
Grab and shoot.

2525
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:19,480
Oh, grab, grab and shoot.

2526
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:21,080
I'm not sh...

2527
02:39:21,080 --> 02:39:21,300
Oh.

2528
02:39:28,710 --> 02:39:29,610
Use the gyro...

2529
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:33,070
Where is it?

2530
02:39:34,030 --> 02:39:35,150
Uh, I lost it.

2531
02:39:36,130 --> 02:39:37,830
I don't know where the gyro went.

2532
02:39:42,250 --> 02:39:43,150
Where did it go?

2533
02:39:43,330 --> 02:39:44,470
Mother of all eggs.

2534
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:47,550
Oh, we're creating the mother of all eggs.

2535
02:39:48,130 --> 02:39:49,910
You can't fret over every omelette.

2536
02:39:51,950 --> 02:39:53,430
Yeah, I remember now.

2537
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:00,620
Oh, oops.

2538
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:11,580
Uh, oh, here?

2539
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:13,580
I'm just gonna...

2540
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:15,020
We're gonna get into the position.

2541
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:19,840
Dore the explorer.

2542
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:22,860
Can I beat these up?

2543
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:23,780
Hold on, I wanna make sure.

2544
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:25,660
I'm not missing any rorbs.

2545
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:29,160
We gotta get as many points as we can, guys.

2546
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:33,180
Okay, I think we're good.

2547
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:38,380
It's the opposite way around.

2548
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:42,100
Wait, no, I'm going the right way around.

2549
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:46,900
Egg of all omelettes can't fret over every mother.

2550
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:51,780
Yeah.

2551
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:57,520
Like your attention to detail.

2552
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:58,180
Thank you.

2553
02:41:02,540 --> 02:41:04,580
This is just like one of my Japanese animations.

2554
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:08,760
I know I need to stop quoting Metal Gear when playing this game, but I also can't help it.

2555
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:09,200
Oh.

2556
02:41:13,220 --> 02:41:13,780
Oh.

2557
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,440
Lost time?

2558
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:16,100
Oh.

2559
02:41:18,620 --> 02:41:19,180
Lizard.

2560
02:41:21,960 --> 02:41:23,640
Did we just get eaten?

2561
02:41:24,380 --> 02:41:24,720
Nope.

2562
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:26,460
Miro's too good for that.

2563
02:41:28,360 --> 02:41:29,600
Oh my gosh.

2564
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:49,620
I missed one.

2565
02:41:53,170 --> 02:41:54,270
The green.

2566
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:56,990
No!

2567
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:58,610
I made it.

2568
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:03,630
Oh man, I missed one.

2569
02:42:08,770 --> 02:42:09,930
Forgotten ruins.

2570
02:42:54,010 --> 02:42:55,850
You can buster it.

2571
02:42:55,870 --> 02:42:56,850
Oh, that's right.

2572
02:42:57,550 --> 02:42:58,830
Thank you for the reminder.

2573
02:43:02,770 --> 02:43:03,370
Hey.

2574
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:03,910
Hey.

2575
02:43:04,310 --> 02:43:04,850
Hey, you.

2576
02:43:05,290 --> 02:43:05,810
You first.

2577
02:43:06,630 --> 02:43:07,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2578
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:10,210
We don't want you infecting anybody.

2579
02:43:13,230 --> 02:43:15,230
Yeah, you tried to come up on me.

2580
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:16,510
You can't.

2581
02:43:17,410 --> 02:43:17,970
You can't.

2582
02:43:19,190 --> 02:43:20,390
You can't.

2583
02:43:23,370 --> 02:43:25,010
Oh man, I missed it.

2584
02:43:26,510 --> 02:43:26,930
Oh.

2585
02:43:27,170 --> 02:43:27,370
Oh.

2586
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:41,460
Oh, have we

2587
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:50,560
got it?

2588
02:43:58,310 --> 02:44:00,250
Literally just a single R.O.R.B.

2589
02:44:00,410 --> 02:44:01,810
I lose my mind.

2590
02:44:02,790 --> 02:44:02,890
Oh.

2591
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:11,460
There will be a day when we are just one R.O.R.B.

2592
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:12,360
off of what we need.

2593
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:14,140
I'm telling you.

2594
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:15,380
It'll happen.

2595
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:17,720
And then I'll be thinking...

2596
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:19,180
Or we'll be one R.O.R.B.

2597
02:44:19,260 --> 02:44:20,520
over what we need.

2598
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:21,300
And I'll be thinking...

2599
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:23,180
Yeah, that one R.O.R.B.

2600
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:23,640
in the river.

2601
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:25,440
It was important.

2602
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:27,840
I am a greedy streamer.

2603
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:34,320
I am greedy, okay?

2604
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:37,320
Let's see.

2605
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:39,880
More P.O.R.B.

2606
02:44:41,380 --> 02:44:41,840
Nice.

2607
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,840
Skill... Oh, we can't do any more skill up.

2608
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:51,540
Are we just getting through the forest?

2609
02:44:51,640 --> 02:44:53,380
Is that what we're supposed to be doing?

2610
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:55,620
Oh, Den of the She-Viper.

2611
02:44:57,240 --> 02:44:57,800
Uh-oh.

2612
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:00,400
That don't sound good.

2613
02:45:01,100 --> 02:45:01,560
Boss time?

2614
02:45:04,060 --> 02:45:04,880
Um, boss lady?

2615
02:45:19,390 --> 02:45:21,210
I wish that...

2616
02:45:21,210 --> 02:45:22,230
I.P.'s weren't...

2617
02:45:22,230 --> 02:45:23,930
Such, like, an annoying thing.

2618
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:25,910
It would be incredible to have...

2619
02:45:26,610 --> 02:45:28,550
Like, a video game theme park.

2620
02:45:30,410 --> 02:45:30,810
Like...

2621
02:45:30,810 --> 02:45:32,490
You know, Nintendo...

2622
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:33,530
That's the one thing about...

2623
02:45:33,530 --> 02:45:35,330
That's nice about, like, Nintendo properties.

2624
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:36,450
Is that, you know, they're...

2625
02:45:36,450 --> 02:45:37,690
Like, Mario's owned by Nintendo.

2626
02:45:37,910 --> 02:45:39,250
But, like, with this, it gets complicated.

2627
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:41,770
Like, imagine having this as a ride.

2628
02:45:41,790 --> 02:45:42,610
Like, a roller coaster.

2629
02:45:44,850 --> 02:45:45,250
Oh!

2630
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:46,390
What the heck?

2631
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:51,900
Did she just throw her seed at me?

2632
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:54,820
I think she wants me.

2633
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:14,660
She looks like a strawberry.

2634
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:16,720
I like that.

2635
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:27,380
Gosh, sorry.

2636
02:46:33,650 --> 02:46:34,630
How do I...

2637
02:46:36,870 --> 02:46:37,890
How do I dodge her?

2638
02:46:57,510 --> 02:46:58,390
Oh, child!

2639
02:46:58,530 --> 02:46:59,610
How do I avoid the...

2640
02:47:03,150 --> 02:47:04,130
What the heck is this?

2641
02:47:05,690 --> 02:47:06,950
Oh, it's one of these things.

2642
02:47:07,070 --> 02:47:07,370
Ouch!

2643
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:08,930
Oh my gosh!

2644
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:14,060
She doesn't like that.

2645
02:47:14,840 --> 02:47:16,400
How do I avoid the attack?

2646
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:17,520
Just by jumping?

2647
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:19,400
Okay, that's what I'm doing.

2648
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:21,520
But I'm still getting hit.

2649
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:26,020
Oh!

2650
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:31,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2651
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:33,320
Oh, I'm definitely gonna have to...

2652
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:35,120
Redo this fight.

2653
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:35,900
That's okay, though.

2654
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:37,800
Oh, gosh!

2655
02:47:58,260 --> 02:47:58,740
Oh.

2656
02:48:03,470 --> 02:48:05,510
Oh god, she's still having babies.

2657
02:48:06,030 --> 02:48:06,210
Oh.

2658
02:48:07,650 --> 02:48:07,850
Wait.

2659
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:11,470
Yeah!

2660
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,040
Oh my god!

2661
02:48:31,780 --> 02:48:32,320
Insane!

2662
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:33,600
Insane!

2663
02:48:43,980 --> 02:48:45,060
Smoking style!

2664
02:48:48,240 --> 02:48:49,800
I am a saucy boy.

2665
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:55,070
Oh, please, I'm trying to jump.

2666
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:56,550
Hold on, I'm gonna use a item.

2667
02:48:57,550 --> 02:48:58,750
I'm gonna use an item.

2668
02:49:00,130 --> 02:49:01,130
Oh, why...

2669
02:49:01,130 --> 02:49:01,670
What just...

2670
02:49:01,670 --> 02:49:02,170
What just happened?

2671
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:03,590
What just disconnected?

2672
02:49:04,670 --> 02:49:05,590
What just happened?

2673
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:13,340
Hmm...

2674
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:14,580
My controller's still working.

2675
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:15,980
That's strange.

2676
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:17,880
Okay, anyway.

2677
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:28,140
Nice!

2678
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:37,160
Ouch!

2679
02:49:54,060 --> 02:49:55,140
Hey, hey, hey!

2680
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:00,400
My children!

2681
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:02,480
Where are you, lady?

2682
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:05,970
I'm stuck in the middle.

2683
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:06,790
I'm stuck in the middle!

2684
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:09,090
Please,

2685
02:50:14,130 --> 02:50:14,370
please!

2686
02:50:14,630 --> 02:50:15,990
There we go.

2687
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:31,860
Holy moly!

2688
02:50:42,370 --> 02:50:47,320
A human!

2689
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:54,800
Aw, dang it.

2690
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:00,320
Nice!

2691
02:51:07,240 --> 02:51:09,100
We absorb her children.

2692
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:16,460
Sephirothic fruit!

2693
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:18,460
One of Echidna's seeds.

2694
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:21,280
This fruit of her womb...

2695
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:22,520
Oh, it really is her eggs!

2696
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:23,920
Wow.

2697
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:26,900
Holds the power that binds together demonic plants.

2698
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:31,200
Those were the last of her eggs.

2699
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:33,560
Hag.

2700
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:38,400
Seems as though the Sephirothic fruit is in harmony with that strange tree.

2701
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:40,840
Nice!

2702
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:47,460
Maybe I didn't need the health, but it was good to do it just in case.

2703
02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:49,160
Probably.

2704
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:52,040
We can recover here.

2705
02:51:54,820 --> 02:51:56,140
I figured there'd be...

2706
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:57,920
There was health on the sides, but it's okay.

2707
02:51:59,620 --> 02:52:01,440
Why is this still not good?

2708
02:52:03,060 --> 02:52:04,500
Better safe than sorry.

2709
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:06,120
Yeah, we did so well too!

2710
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:08,000
So I wanted us to...

2711
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,940
We were killing it.

2712
02:52:10,580 --> 02:52:11,180
Literally.

2713
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:12,700
We were killing her.

2714
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:15,400
You gamed.

2715
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,940
We gamed!

2716
02:52:18,460 --> 02:52:19,060
Hello?

2717
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,100
Oh, I just have to interact with...

2718
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:21,560
Okay, nevermind.

2719
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:26,880
Nice.

2720
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:28,000
All right.

2721
02:52:29,820 --> 02:52:30,420
Yay!

2722
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:39,660
Yay!

2723
02:52:41,960 --> 02:52:45,160
We got less points than I imagined we would, to be honest.

2724
02:52:45,740 --> 02:52:47,140
With how many stylish points I got.

2725
02:52:47,160 --> 02:52:51,480
I wish we would get the stylish points in terms of the soul stuff.

2726
02:52:54,160 --> 02:52:56,360
95% of orbs found though.

2727
02:52:56,660 --> 02:52:57,300
It's kind of crazy.

2728
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:01,040
Before we do...

2729
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:05,100
Oh, because of the item!

2730
02:53:05,380 --> 02:53:06,060
You're right.

2731
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:06,720
You're right.

2732
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:09,300
Embrace the light to escape the forest.

2733
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:11,640
Okay.

2734
02:53:16,730 --> 02:53:17,690
Should we...

2735
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:19,450
Save up for...

2736
02:53:21,110 --> 02:53:21,730
Oh wait!

2737
02:53:22,050 --> 02:53:22,530
Trigger heart!

2738
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:23,570
Now we can get this one!

2739
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:26,210
Now we can get trigger heart.

2740
02:53:29,130 --> 02:53:32,750
I was gonna say save up for these, but I think trigger heart will be really good too.

2741
02:53:32,890 --> 02:53:34,150
So that since...

2742
02:53:34,150 --> 02:53:38,310
It'd be better to use less double trigger.

2743
02:53:40,790 --> 02:53:41,670
Maze puzzle?

2744
02:53:41,970 --> 02:53:42,310
Uh-oh.

2745
02:53:44,790 --> 02:53:45,750
Anything else?

2746
02:53:46,050 --> 02:53:46,450
I'm thinking...

2747
02:53:49,390 --> 02:53:49,870
Why?

2748
02:53:50,690 --> 02:53:51,090
Why?

2749
02:53:58,400 --> 02:53:59,860
Oh, this is revving up.

2750
02:54:00,240 --> 02:54:01,780
Which I do sometimes when I remember.

2751
02:54:02,220 --> 02:54:03,620
I think I've used it once today.

2752
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:06,900
Charge shot!

2753
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:08,640
Uh...

2754
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:09,480
No, that's...

2755
02:54:09,480 --> 02:54:09,760
Oh!

2756
02:54:11,980 --> 02:54:13,680
Snatch three, I really want.

2757
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:14,380
I'm not gonna lie.

2758
02:54:23,820 --> 02:54:24,860
Rev up before fight.

2759
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:25,900
Yeah, you're right.

2760
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:27,560
You're right, you're right.

2761
02:54:30,540 --> 02:54:31,740
Why do you snatch so much?

2762
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:34,060
Snatch is more likely to be useful too.

2763
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:35,260
I think so too, right?

2764
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:39,340
Charge shot three is Nero's biggest damage?

2765
02:54:39,420 --> 02:54:39,780
Really?

2766
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:44,300
Do I need charge shot two and one?

2767
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:46,320
Well, I need charge shot, right?

2768
02:54:46,860 --> 02:54:49,380
Or do I just need to get charge shot three?

2769
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:53,440
Streak two?

2770
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:54,420
Do I not have that one?

2771
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:56,280
Oh, I don't.

2772
02:54:58,260 --> 02:54:59,400
Okay, so there's a couple.

2773
02:54:59,640 --> 02:55:01,160
I use streak a lot as well.

2774
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:03,600
There's so many options.

2775
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:05,260
So many choices.

2776
02:55:07,660 --> 02:55:09,280
You need to get one and two to get three.

2777
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:10,000
Ah, okay.

2778
02:55:10,200 --> 02:55:11,120
You have to buy all of them.

2779
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:11,820
Okay, okay, okay.

2780
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:17,740
We could get streak two immediately because I use streak a lot.

2781
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:31,420
Or I could wait for snatch three, which we might be able to get next round.

2782
02:55:32,900 --> 02:55:35,040
Either one will benefit me, to be honest.

2783
02:55:41,390 --> 02:55:42,810
Get streak two.

2784
02:55:44,330 --> 02:55:45,670
I almost feel like...

2785
02:55:47,010 --> 02:55:49,810
I almost feel like refunding this because I'm so bad at it.

2786
02:55:50,290 --> 02:55:51,010
Doing it.

2787
02:55:53,470 --> 02:55:54,890
I'm so bad at the roulette.

2788
02:55:55,090 --> 02:55:56,650
I'd never activate it like ever.

2789
02:55:58,250 --> 02:56:00,470
If you tap exceed after swinging, you gain it back.

2790
02:56:01,670 --> 02:56:02,350
Gain what back?

2791
02:56:10,460 --> 02:56:11,560
Oh, you thought I meant the game?

2792
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:12,100
No!

2793
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:18,800
You don't really use combo C either.

2794
02:56:22,610 --> 02:56:24,730
Oh, yeah, because it's like the yy pause.

2795
02:56:24,950 --> 02:56:26,030
I'm so bad at the combos.

2796
02:56:26,170 --> 02:56:26,670
I'm sorry, guys.

2797
02:56:26,670 --> 02:56:30,750
I'm not a fighting gamer gamer, so I never...

2798
02:56:30,750 --> 02:56:32,330
I don't think in combos, you know?

2799
02:56:33,050 --> 02:56:33,970
I'm never thinking that.

2800
02:56:34,030 --> 02:56:36,150
My brain does not work in that process.

2801
02:56:44,740 --> 02:56:46,440
I'm still beating things, though.

2802
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:52,900
They're both great, but you can refund for something you'll use.

2803
02:56:53,740 --> 02:56:55,940
Maybe we can get it back later, you know?

2804
02:56:56,200 --> 02:56:57,700
Maybe if I refund...

2805
02:56:57,700 --> 02:56:58,640
Is there a way to refund?

2806
02:56:59,000 --> 02:56:59,660
Oh, yeah, here we go.

2807
02:57:00,100 --> 02:57:01,180
I'm gonna refund this.

2808
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:03,540
And I'm gonna refund this for now.

2809
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:12,540
We can get them back later because what I'll do is I'll get snatch three for now.

2810
02:57:14,900 --> 02:57:18,100
And then I could always get them back in the future.

2811
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:20,440
Because those...

2812
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:20,780
These...

2813
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:24,260
These I use so much because I'm a one trick pony.

2814
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:31,060
Let's do that for now.

2815
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:38,140
The non-combo stuff is so strong, so it's fine.

2816
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:44,420
This is such a pretty picture.

2817
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:45,160
Take a screenshot.

2818
02:57:47,900 --> 02:57:49,440
Get some rollers.

2819
02:57:51,280 --> 02:57:52,340
Roaring time.

2820
02:57:53,800 --> 02:57:54,660
Where am I?

2821
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:12,240
That's where you are going.

2822
02:58:14,660 --> 02:58:15,080
Wow.

2823
02:58:21,870 --> 02:58:22,630
Crush you!

2824
02:58:26,590 --> 02:58:27,410
Wait, that guy!

2825
02:58:28,190 --> 02:58:29,090
He's the important one.

2826
02:58:29,130 --> 02:58:29,450
There we go.

2827
02:58:34,730 --> 02:58:35,150
Okay.

2828
02:58:36,230 --> 02:58:38,490
Hey guys, I gotta get my rorbs.

2829
02:58:39,410 --> 02:58:39,650
Oh, yeah.

2830
02:58:44,390 --> 02:58:45,190
Anything else?

2831
02:58:45,830 --> 02:58:47,210
No, we're just running, running.

2832
02:58:48,390 --> 02:58:48,930
There were some...

2833
02:58:48,930 --> 02:58:51,330
Oh, I was gonna say there's some other tentacles we gotta get rid of.

2834
02:58:54,090 --> 02:58:54,970
EMC4 is autosave.

2835
02:58:55,010 --> 02:58:56,150
Yes, it's autosave.

2836
02:58:56,230 --> 02:58:56,670
So I'll...

2837
02:58:56,670 --> 02:58:57,690
I don't know who was asking.

2838
02:58:58,610 --> 02:58:59,950
But we're all good.

2839
02:59:00,490 --> 02:59:01,450
Or we should be good.

2840
02:59:01,690 --> 02:59:02,510
I think we're good.

2841
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:03,910
Are we good?

2842
02:59:04,150 --> 02:59:04,710
Very good.

2843
02:59:13,880 --> 02:59:17,260
Is this not the area with the secret?

2844
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:19,260
Oh, it's over on this side.

2845
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:26,820
Nah, sorry.

2846
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:28,800
No!

2847
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:29,960
I'm gonna try one more time.

2848
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:38,740
We have longer snatch now.

2849
02:59:41,780 --> 02:59:43,540
We have longer snatch now.

2850
02:59:48,440 --> 02:59:49,500
Jump, King.

2851
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:55,720
Maybe the camera is fixed.

2852
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:57,660
Yeah, maybe we just have to leave and come back.

2853
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:00,320
And the camera will have fixed itself.

2854
03:00:08,600 --> 03:00:09,360
Oh, King.

2855
03:00:11,780 --> 03:00:12,300
Please!

2856
03:00:13,060 --> 03:00:14,560
I can't, I can't.

2857
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:22,880
I'm pressing forward, please!

2858
03:00:25,400 --> 03:00:25,920
Oh.

2859
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:28,000
That was my fault.

2860
03:00:28,120 --> 03:00:29,320
That one was actually my fault.

2861
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:31,600
Redo.

2862
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:36,320
The camera is so crazy.

2863
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:39,820
The camera gets me the mostest.

2864
03:00:39,820 --> 03:00:40,380
Ah.

2865
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:45,740
Because it changes my controls mid camera shift.

2866
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:48,200
So I'm just like...

2867
03:00:52,760 --> 03:00:54,560
It's all about finding the rhythm.

2868
03:00:57,160 --> 03:00:58,460
Let go of lock-on.

2869
03:00:58,580 --> 03:01:00,800
I'm not holding it permanently, but I'll try to remember to...

2870
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:04,920
Oh, I see.

2871
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:05,620
Oh.

2872
03:01:05,960 --> 03:01:06,140
Oh,

2873
03:01:09,470 --> 03:01:13,990
maybe that's what was killing me before.

2874
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:24,110
Whoever said that?

2875
03:01:25,150 --> 03:01:26,810
Actually, I think several people said that.

2876
03:01:28,470 --> 03:01:30,230
Wow, I did it so easily.

2877
03:01:30,650 --> 03:01:32,030
Oh my gosh.

2878
03:01:34,310 --> 03:01:37,550
I did it so easily as soon as I stopped locking on the whole time.

2879
03:01:37,770 --> 03:01:39,210
That's what was killing the camera.

2880
03:01:39,370 --> 03:01:41,070
Was me just locking on.

2881
03:01:41,710 --> 03:01:43,370
I didn't even realize.

2882
03:01:43,530 --> 03:01:46,570
Oh my gosh, I feel like such a fool right now.

2883
03:01:48,250 --> 03:01:49,470
I feel like...

2884
03:01:49,470 --> 03:01:50,790
Because it's me, I'm like...

2885
03:01:50,790 --> 03:01:53,890
I'm like, game, why are you messing up the camera for me?

2886
03:01:54,210 --> 03:01:54,950
It's me.

2887
03:01:55,550 --> 03:01:57,050
I'm my own worst enemy.

2888
03:01:58,030 --> 03:01:58,630
Wow.

2889
03:02:01,490 --> 03:02:02,990
I can't believe it.

2890
03:02:03,650 --> 03:02:04,390
Thanks, guys.

2891
03:02:09,070 --> 03:02:10,210
Foolish Minto.

2892
03:02:11,230 --> 03:02:12,810
Which way did I come from?

2893
03:02:13,550 --> 03:02:15,790
Oh, I came from over that side.

2894
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:18,570
Yeah.

2895
03:02:19,410 --> 03:02:21,110
Because it says so on the map.

2896
03:02:23,190 --> 03:02:26,130
And then I need to go back to where we came from.

2897
03:02:26,230 --> 03:02:27,610
So it's this...

2898
03:02:27,610 --> 03:02:27,950
Am I...

2899
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:29,110
Wait, am I going the right way?

2900
03:02:31,310 --> 03:02:32,750
I think I need the map map.

2901
03:02:34,770 --> 03:02:37,310
Oh, I wish it showed.

2902
03:02:39,370 --> 03:02:43,470
Oh, I guess we can technically go down...

2903
03:02:43,470 --> 03:02:44,350
Wait.

2904
03:02:44,850 --> 03:02:47,010
Yeah, we can go this way and then we go up.

2905
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:52,150
And then these look to be...

2906
03:02:53,590 --> 03:02:56,650
These are most likely where those vines were.

2907
03:03:01,870 --> 03:03:06,270
I could go through this door, but wouldn't this one be easier?

2908
03:03:11,990 --> 03:03:13,310
Unlock the gray path.

2909
03:03:13,370 --> 03:03:14,030
What gray path?

2910
03:03:21,300 --> 03:03:22,280
Lower door.

2911
03:03:23,800 --> 03:03:25,040
This one, right?

2912
03:03:26,140 --> 03:03:27,340
The one in the middle of the screen.

2913
03:03:27,740 --> 03:03:29,200
The time is coming, so...

2914
03:03:32,700 --> 03:03:35,620
The game wants you to remember where the red vines were located.

2915
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:39,140
Yeah, and I'm saying that they're most likely these two little areas, no?

2916
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:42,340
Because they're the only ways I haven't gone yet.

2917
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:51,700
So I feel like it's that area.

2918
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:59,300
I'm gonna try going to this door down here.

2919
03:04:04,210 --> 03:04:05,650
Because the other one will be...

2920
03:04:10,520 --> 03:04:10,700
Oh!

2921
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,720
Oh my god.

2922
03:04:16,280 --> 03:04:17,200
Hey, you!

2923
03:04:17,460 --> 03:04:17,880
Crush!

2924
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:27,740
Oh no no no!

2925
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:29,200
My roooorbs!

2926
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:30,140
They're all over the ground!

2927
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:31,740
All

2928
03:04:35,410 --> 03:04:36,310
my roooorbs!

2929
03:04:37,990 --> 03:04:40,990
Okay, and then I go up here.

2930
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:44,870
Oh, up here.

2931
03:04:45,770 --> 03:04:46,790
Literally up.

2932
03:04:47,430 --> 03:04:48,590
Wait, can I go up there?

2933
03:04:53,630 --> 03:04:56,070
I can't go up there.

2934
03:04:57,530 --> 03:05:00,250
Oh, I could go around.

2935
03:05:02,290 --> 03:05:04,230
Because isn't this one the...

2936
03:05:04,230 --> 03:05:07,130
Isn't that the disappearing one with the flying guys?

2937
03:05:07,990 --> 03:05:10,090
This... this route right here?

2938
03:05:11,130 --> 03:05:12,550
That's why I avoided it.

2939
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:25,500
In case you're wondering what my thought process is.

2940
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:28,280
I like that it's starting to rain.

2941
03:05:30,120 --> 03:05:31,320
Keep going to the east.

2942
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:33,420
Oh, we're back here!

2943
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:37,140
Fun.

2944
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:41,680
Oh, it's getting dark.

2945
03:05:42,740 --> 03:05:43,160
Wait.

2946
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:07,960
Can I even go through this way?

2947
03:06:08,020 --> 03:06:10,060
It didn't let me before.

2948
03:06:11,160 --> 03:06:12,160
Oh, we can now!

2949
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:12,740
We can now!

2950
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:13,320
We can now!

2951
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:20,920
I'm spawn killing them.

2952
03:06:25,810 --> 03:06:26,230
Aha!

2953
03:06:26,810 --> 03:06:28,870
It wouldn't let us before, but now we can.

2954
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:32,170
Okay, sorry.

2955
03:06:32,290 --> 03:06:33,850
I'm gonna go back to the map.

2956
03:06:33,850 --> 03:06:35,550
Ah, cute!

2957
03:06:44,840 --> 03:06:46,940
I remember this area.

2958
03:06:48,520 --> 03:06:49,320
I think.

2959
03:06:49,460 --> 03:06:49,740
Yeah!

2960
03:06:54,970 --> 03:06:56,090
Oh no!

2961
03:06:56,370 --> 03:06:57,050
Oh my gosh.

2962
03:06:57,210 --> 03:06:58,190
I can't get over there.

2963
03:07:18,470 --> 03:07:19,030
More?

2964
03:07:19,610 --> 03:07:20,310
Oh my gosh.

2965
03:07:23,010 --> 03:07:24,070
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2966
03:07:25,170 --> 03:07:27,330
They were like, hey, you didn't let us possess any of them.

2967
03:07:27,330 --> 03:07:29,250
So we're just gonna spawn one in to make things...

2968
03:07:30,150 --> 03:07:33,430
not as... make things annoying for you, huh?

2969
03:07:41,290 --> 03:07:42,150
Oh, oops.

2970
03:07:43,050 --> 03:07:43,590
There we go.

2971
03:07:51,330 --> 03:07:52,370
Well now...

2972
03:07:52,370 --> 03:07:53,050
What?

2973
03:07:53,110 --> 03:07:55,310
Now I feel even more... I feel silly again.

2974
03:07:55,570 --> 03:07:56,510
Wait, what the heck?

2975
03:07:57,110 --> 03:07:57,390
Wait.

2976
03:07:58,050 --> 03:07:59,210
No, this is...

2977
03:08:01,410 --> 03:08:03,510
I feel silly again.

2978
03:08:08,570 --> 03:08:09,170
Okay.

2979
03:08:10,070 --> 03:08:10,810
Wait, keep going?

2980
03:08:11,970 --> 03:08:12,350
Am I?

2981
03:08:17,030 --> 03:08:19,470
We're going like the longest way possible.

2982
03:08:20,270 --> 03:08:21,290
Who knows?

2983
03:08:21,330 --> 03:08:23,170
Who knows if we could have even gone this way?

2984
03:08:24,290 --> 03:08:25,010
I don't know.

2985
03:08:29,050 --> 03:08:31,230
Well, this thing won't give me another boar, but...

2986
03:08:34,710 --> 03:08:35,230
Tomfoolery.

2987
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:34,770
There's one guy right now in the chat punching the air being like, I tried to tell her.

2988
03:09:35,670 --> 03:09:37,850
You did not see my message.

2989
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:46,230
No, please Gabe!

2990
03:09:47,230 --> 03:09:48,950
Gabe, would you be so kind?

2991
03:09:49,590 --> 03:09:49,950
Please!

2992
03:10:07,470 --> 03:10:08,030
Be...

2993
03:10:09,530 --> 03:10:11,250
Thank you for the gift.

2994
03:10:11,810 --> 03:10:17,370
Do you guys think ghosts are just...

2995
03:10:18,410 --> 03:10:20,410
No, I'm not even gonna read that.

2996
03:10:20,830 --> 03:10:21,710
Why would you say that?

2997
03:10:23,290 --> 03:10:24,310
Let me in!

2998
03:10:24,350 --> 03:10:25,570
Open the new war!

2999
03:10:26,390 --> 03:10:28,050
Open the new war!

3000
03:10:33,490 --> 03:10:39,110
Oh, and they even put this platform here too because they're just pure evil.

3001
03:10:40,610 --> 03:10:42,070
They're pure evil.

3002
03:11:01,140 --> 03:11:03,720
I guess I could be roar farming right now.

3003
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:06,380
I don't feel like it.

3004
03:11:07,180 --> 03:11:08,020
I'm angry.

3005
03:11:09,260 --> 03:11:11,480
Wait, why isn't it showing up anywhere?

3006
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:12,780
Hold on, sorry about that.

3007
03:11:13,240 --> 03:11:14,300
Wait, how many gifted was it?

3008
03:11:14,300 --> 03:11:15,700
No, I thought it was just one.

3009
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:19,960
How many gifted was it?

3010
03:11:20,360 --> 03:11:21,300
Why didn't it show up for me?

3011
03:11:21,640 --> 03:11:22,040
Hold on.

3012
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:26,640
Oh, 50!

3013
03:11:26,960 --> 03:11:28,920
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!

3014
03:11:29,220 --> 03:11:30,560
Here I sound like I'm ungrateful.

3015
03:11:31,780 --> 03:11:33,100
It didn't show up as 50 for me.

3016
03:11:33,160 --> 03:11:34,340
Oh my gosh, thank you!

3017
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:35,720
I feel so bad.

3018
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:36,560
Thank you so much!

3019
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:38,360
It usually shows up at the top, no?

3020
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:41,060
All right, let's see.

3021
03:11:41,960 --> 03:11:42,360
Map.

3022
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:47,520
Oops.

3023
03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:53,080
These are new guys, no?

3024
03:11:53,280 --> 03:11:53,920
What are these things?

3025
03:11:58,680 --> 03:11:59,060
Ouch!

3026
03:12:00,080 --> 03:12:01,020
What are these things?

3027
03:12:01,120 --> 03:12:01,700
Oh my gosh!

3028
03:12:02,180 --> 03:12:03,680
Are these the children when they grow up?

3029
03:12:08,340 --> 03:12:09,420
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3030
03:12:14,500 --> 03:12:15,920
I'm just gonna keep whacking them.

3031
03:12:17,500 --> 03:12:18,200
Slam dunk!

3032
03:12:18,620 --> 03:12:19,740
Oh, they're strong.

3033
03:12:24,770 --> 03:12:25,470
Hahaha!

3034
03:12:25,830 --> 03:12:26,570
Oh, they're guarding!

3035
03:12:26,770 --> 03:12:28,190
There's the smart little guys.

3036
03:12:28,690 --> 03:12:29,170
It's so funny.

3037
03:12:41,420 --> 03:12:42,700
How many are there?

3038
03:12:55,270 --> 03:12:55,710
Shoo!

3039
03:13:02,930 --> 03:13:05,210
They look just like their mother.

3040
03:13:09,070 --> 03:13:09,670
Anymore?

3041
03:13:11,490 --> 03:13:12,130
That's it?

3042
03:13:16,330 --> 03:13:17,030
Anymore?

3043
03:13:17,590 --> 03:13:17,850
Oh!

3044
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:19,390
Nero?

3045
03:13:23,570 --> 03:13:25,890
He's sneaking like a Looney Tunes villain.

3046
03:13:30,200 --> 03:13:32,420
I thought it would take me to the other side.

3047
03:13:32,680 --> 03:13:35,760
Okay, now we're in a bit of a predicament, no?

3048
03:13:41,560 --> 03:13:42,080
Uh...

3049
03:13:47,060 --> 03:13:47,580
What?

3050
03:13:50,720 --> 03:13:53,260
Oh, sorry, my chat froze.

3051
03:13:53,300 --> 03:13:55,200
I was like...

3052
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,220
What's going on?

3053
03:13:59,540 --> 03:13:59,900
Uh...

3054
03:13:59,900 --> 03:14:01,380
You have one more door that you didn't try.

3055
03:14:01,920 --> 03:14:02,400
I do?

3056
03:14:03,360 --> 03:14:04,140
Take the leap of faith.

3057
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:05,320
That's where I just was!

3058
03:14:05,500 --> 03:14:06,400
I was just there!

3059
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:09,820
One more door that I didn't try.

3060
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:12,560
Oh, this...

3061
03:14:13,120 --> 03:14:14,020
This one right here?

3062
03:14:22,960 --> 03:14:25,460
Uh, sorry, I'm gonna be looking at the map a lot.

3063
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:30,180
Yeah, okay.

3064
03:14:36,390 --> 03:14:38,130
Oh, the big guy's not there anymore.

3065
03:14:41,860 --> 03:14:43,140
These little guys are!

3066
03:14:50,130 --> 03:14:51,450
Oh my gosh!

3067
03:14:51,510 --> 03:14:52,170
I would have known!

3068
03:14:55,030 --> 03:14:56,630
Oh, oh, uh-oh.

3069
03:14:56,930 --> 03:14:57,310
Ambush?

3070
03:14:58,690 --> 03:14:59,290
Oh,

3071
03:15:02,330 --> 03:15:05,550
there was a whole introduction for these guys and I just never saw it!

3072
03:15:09,190 --> 03:15:11,490
Hey, I spoiled the surprise!

3073
03:15:14,830 --> 03:15:15,430
Ouch!

3074
03:15:21,420 --> 03:15:22,440
Oh my gosh!

3075
03:15:23,320 --> 03:15:24,240
Ouchie, ouch!

3076
03:15:31,210 --> 03:15:33,190
Yeah, you tried to bite me!

3077
03:15:33,650 --> 03:15:34,650
I'll get your butt!

3078
03:15:37,810 --> 03:15:38,110
Yeah!

3079
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:44,960
Oh, he's dead.

3080
03:15:48,230 --> 03:15:50,190
Yeah, I accidentally spoiled it!

3081
03:15:51,410 --> 03:15:53,090
That was so funny.

3082
03:15:53,410 --> 03:15:53,730
Oh no!

3083
03:15:54,190 --> 03:15:54,870
My raw arms!

3084
03:15:55,630 --> 03:15:56,150
I got him.

3085
03:15:58,890 --> 03:15:59,890
Invisible wall.

3086
03:16:00,950 --> 03:16:01,830
There for some reason.

3087
03:16:01,830 --> 03:16:02,670
Oh, no?

3088
03:16:03,110 --> 03:16:03,390
Huh?

3089
03:16:03,650 --> 03:16:04,890
Why wouldn't it let me go there?

3090
03:16:05,010 --> 03:16:07,810
Oh, that's so strange.

3091
03:16:07,910 --> 03:16:08,450
Oh, that works.

3092
03:16:09,230 --> 03:16:10,170
Okay, okay, okay.

3093
03:16:11,070 --> 03:16:12,590
We were in this area before.

3094
03:16:12,690 --> 03:16:13,470
I should have known that.

3095
03:16:13,650 --> 03:16:14,770
That was how that worked.

3096
03:16:19,360 --> 03:16:22,620
Miro can't get over one tiny measly little step.

3097
03:16:22,860 --> 03:16:24,040
This is just, just a baby.

3098
03:16:25,280 --> 03:16:26,480
It's just a baby!

3099
03:16:28,880 --> 03:16:31,520
God, this place is great for orb farming.

3100
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:38,040
It always looks like a huge big money amount, right?

3101
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:40,620
But you get like, measly little bits.

3102
03:16:41,780 --> 03:16:44,540
But it's exciting to see big orbs come out, you know what I mean?

3103
03:16:46,100 --> 03:16:47,980
What is his actual age in this game?

3104
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:50,480
I don't know.

3105
03:16:53,320 --> 03:16:55,360
Okay, correct direction.

3106
03:17:12,250 --> 03:17:14,020
I know I don't need it, but it's...

3107
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:16,660
What if, what if something starts spawning?

3108
03:17:17,280 --> 03:17:18,860
Or not, just kidding.

3109
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:21,560
Okay.

3110
03:17:23,060 --> 03:17:25,400
It was through this door, no?

3111
03:17:28,340 --> 03:17:29,100
Yes.

3112
03:17:30,380 --> 03:17:32,180
So we went through this door.

3113
03:17:34,500 --> 03:17:35,640
Up here.

3114
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:39,920
I remember.

3115
03:17:40,800 --> 03:17:41,560
I rember.

3116
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:44,000
I rember, I rember, I rember.

3117
03:17:44,020 --> 03:17:44,520
I rember.

3118
03:17:52,780 --> 03:17:53,880
Nice rember.

3119
03:17:54,760 --> 03:17:55,680
It seems like the set...

3120
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:56,220
Oh, yes.

3121
03:17:56,540 --> 03:17:57,200
The strange tree.

3122
03:17:57,540 --> 03:17:57,840
Yes.

3123
03:18:06,050 --> 03:18:06,610
Oh,

3124
03:18:17,150 --> 03:18:18,450
I'm not hitting anything.

3125
03:18:24,110 --> 03:18:25,230
Stop blocking!

3126
03:18:25,430 --> 03:18:27,590
Why are the lizards so smart all of a sudden?

3127
03:18:28,150 --> 03:18:29,890
He follows me, it's so creepy.

3128
03:18:37,180 --> 03:18:38,700
Let's destroy all these before...

3129
03:18:42,570 --> 03:18:44,150
Before they all hatch.

3130
03:18:44,930 --> 03:18:46,090
The game would feel...

3131
03:18:46,090 --> 03:18:48,450
I feel like the game would totally do that to me.

3132
03:18:55,870 --> 03:18:56,850
Yeah, thank you.

3133
03:19:07,970 --> 03:19:08,470
Ouch!

3134
03:19:08,910 --> 03:19:09,570
What did you do?

3135
03:19:16,540 --> 03:19:17,040
Okay.

3136
03:19:18,300 --> 03:19:20,680
I got his ass when he tried to get me.

3137
03:19:28,040 --> 03:19:28,540
Hey!

3138
03:19:32,180 --> 03:19:33,860
DT'd just for one final hit.

3139
03:19:35,380 --> 03:19:35,740
Okay.

3140
03:19:40,220 --> 03:19:40,740
Okay.

3141
03:19:46,240 --> 03:19:48,360
I'm still so curious what this is for.

3142
03:19:52,260 --> 03:19:53,240
All right.

3143
03:19:53,520 --> 03:19:54,200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

3144
03:19:54,240 --> 03:19:54,860
It was down here.

3145
03:20:05,070 --> 03:20:06,110
Finally, progress!

3146
03:20:11,350 --> 03:20:11,910
Oh,

3147
03:20:15,570 --> 03:20:16,090
you guys...

3148
03:20:16,090 --> 03:20:16,330
Wait.

3149
03:20:17,390 --> 03:20:19,230
Did we even make it to the maze?

3150
03:20:19,410 --> 03:20:21,010
Or is this the maze?

3151
03:20:22,750 --> 03:20:25,110
Have I been in the maze the whole time?

3152
03:20:29,250 --> 03:20:30,530
There's no way.

3153
03:20:31,210 --> 03:20:32,670
This is the maze.

3154
03:20:32,970 --> 03:20:35,030
I've been trapped for like 30 minutes.

3155
03:20:39,290 --> 03:20:41,370
I've been trapped for like 30 minutes.

3156
03:20:41,390 --> 03:20:41,430
Shit, I'm gonna die.

3157
03:20:41,430 --> 03:20:42,470
She's coming the wrong way!

3158
03:20:42,970 --> 03:20:43,970
This is a gentle forest.

3159
03:20:44,050 --> 03:20:47,270
Yet those who treat her unkindly will fall into darkness.

3160
03:20:48,390 --> 03:20:51,590
Those who do not wish for darkness should seek the light.

3161
03:20:52,010 --> 03:20:54,030
For if not, all efforts will be in vain.

3162
03:20:54,910 --> 03:20:55,170
Okay!

3163
03:20:58,110 --> 03:20:58,550
Holy...

3164
03:20:58,550 --> 03:20:59,230
Oh, god.

3165
03:21:00,550 --> 03:21:02,210
The maze was our mind.

3166
03:21:02,430 --> 03:21:03,990
I thought I was big braining it.

3167
03:21:04,050 --> 03:21:05,030
And yet, I just...

3168
03:21:08,370 --> 03:21:10,110
Can you guys just tell me where to go?

3169
03:21:11,430 --> 03:21:13,390
I've gone through so much trouble already.

3170
03:21:14,070 --> 03:21:16,190
I feel like just looking up a guide.

3171
03:21:19,010 --> 03:21:22,070
Does unkindness mean destroying the eggs or...?

3172
03:21:27,030 --> 03:21:28,710
Follow the sun is the hint.

3173
03:21:29,710 --> 03:21:29,970
Okay.

3174
03:21:31,570 --> 03:21:32,870
It's everywhere is the sun.

3175
03:21:33,230 --> 03:21:34,390
Everywhere is blinding.

3176
03:21:36,810 --> 03:21:37,910
Follow the light.

3177
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:41,410
Opposite of shadows, so this way.

3178
03:21:41,430 --> 03:21:41,510
Okay.

3179
03:21:46,920 --> 03:21:47,980
Lost woods.

3180
03:21:49,780 --> 03:21:51,380
Wait, did I go the wrong way?

3181
03:21:53,860 --> 03:21:55,200
Opposite the shadow...

3182
03:21:55,200 --> 03:21:56,560
Oh, the statue's shadow.

3183
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:20,820
Forgotten ruins.

3184
03:22:28,030 --> 03:22:29,890
Would have been fun if you got lost.

3185
03:22:30,410 --> 03:22:30,910
Sorry.

3186
03:22:31,670 --> 03:22:32,290
I'm tired.

3187
03:22:32,490 --> 03:22:34,230
Oh, don't jump down, Nero!

3188
03:22:34,650 --> 03:22:37,050
Whatever you do, don't do it.

3189
03:22:43,610 --> 03:22:44,750
Training ground.

3190
03:22:44,870 --> 03:22:47,030
I noticed there was a moth on the door.

3191
03:22:55,290 --> 03:22:56,470
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3192
03:22:57,710 --> 03:22:58,690
I can't see.

3193
03:23:24,470 --> 03:23:24,750
Wait.

3194
03:23:32,270 --> 03:23:32,950
Silly.

3195
03:23:39,300 --> 03:23:40,740
That guy's down, at least.

3196
03:23:41,380 --> 03:23:42,420
There we go.

3197
03:23:42,540 --> 03:23:42,880
Okay.

3198
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:46,900
Okay, okay, okay.

3199
03:23:48,620 --> 03:23:51,860
Have you tried smashing your furniture to see if any rorps come out?

3200
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:53,300
I should.

3201
03:23:54,860 --> 03:23:56,660
I think that everybody should.

3202
03:23:56,820 --> 03:23:57,580
Smart idea.

3203
03:23:58,720 --> 03:23:59,860
Do not jump down.

3204
03:24:00,460 --> 03:24:02,040
Do not jump down.

3205
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:02,900
Do not pass gold.

3206
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:03,860
Do not collect $200.

3207
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:07,780
I think I can get another porb.

3208
03:24:07,820 --> 03:24:08,180
I can!

3209
03:24:09,820 --> 03:24:12,040
Honestly, if I save up, I could get the last blorb.

3210
03:24:13,120 --> 03:24:14,020
Maybe I'll do that.

3211
03:24:14,840 --> 03:24:17,920
Maybe I'll get the last blorb and then we can focus on all on porb.

3212
03:24:36,510 --> 03:24:37,990
How many vital stars do I have?

3213
03:24:38,030 --> 03:24:38,270
Two?

3214
03:24:38,610 --> 03:24:39,110
That should be good.

3215
03:24:40,630 --> 03:24:41,210
For now.

3216
03:24:54,570 --> 03:24:58,110
Also, thank you for the help with the maze, you guys.

3217
03:24:58,110 --> 03:25:02,930
Usually, I would have just done it without a hint, like, from you guys.

3218
03:25:05,270 --> 03:25:05,750
But...

3219
03:25:05,750 --> 03:25:10,190
Since I wasted all that time running around, I just wanted to get it over with.

3220
03:25:10,210 --> 03:25:10,630
I'm sorry.

3221
03:25:11,510 --> 03:25:16,110
The intended way to get 100% red orbs is to jump off the balcony you were at and backtrack to the ledge you were on.

3222
03:25:16,510 --> 03:25:16,990
No!

3223
03:25:17,850 --> 03:25:18,330
No!

3224
03:25:19,270 --> 03:25:20,310
Don't make me!

3225
03:25:20,590 --> 03:25:20,990
Please!

3226
03:25:26,010 --> 03:25:26,790
You're good.

3227
03:25:27,850 --> 03:25:29,370
Thank you for understanding.

3228
03:25:32,850 --> 03:25:35,210
I need to get more water soon.

3229
03:25:37,150 --> 03:25:37,710
Oh!

3230
03:25:38,250 --> 03:25:38,950
Caleb!

3231
03:25:39,790 --> 03:25:40,650
Uh...

3232
03:25:40,650 --> 03:25:41,310
What's his name?

3233
03:25:42,010 --> 03:25:43,190
Uh...

3234
03:25:43,190 --> 03:25:43,810
Campbell?

3235
03:25:45,150 --> 03:25:45,740
Uh...

3236
03:25:46,330 --> 03:25:46,850
Kyle.

3237
03:25:48,470 --> 03:25:49,390
Korble.

3238
03:25:50,650 --> 03:25:52,050
What's his name?

3239
03:25:54,330 --> 03:25:54,920
Oh...

3240
03:25:57,390 --> 03:25:58,050
Credo!

3241
03:26:02,290 --> 03:26:02,930
lol

3242
03:26:07,970 --> 03:26:08,610
Yeah!

3243
03:26:08,950 --> 03:26:10,030
Who the hell is Dante?

3244
03:26:12,490 --> 03:26:13,090
Ha!

3245
03:26:14,250 --> 03:26:18,250
Hey, I'm like, basically your brother-in-law.

3246
03:26:20,510 --> 03:26:21,150
Credit.

3247
03:26:23,290 --> 03:26:26,510
So what is your holiness?

3248
03:26:27,850 --> 03:26:28,750
You're Pope Man.

3249
03:26:32,190 --> 03:26:32,790
Kirie.

3250
03:26:33,210 --> 03:26:34,230
Hurt me?

3251
03:26:34,790 --> 03:26:36,790
You don't.

3252
03:26:46,790 --> 03:26:47,490
You too.

3253
03:26:50,730 --> 03:26:51,110
No!

3254
03:26:51,970 --> 03:26:52,730
Oh, shoot.

3255
03:26:52,810 --> 03:26:56,490
I have been chosen to take the next step in evolution.

3256
03:26:57,350 --> 03:27:01,270
To become something far more than just a human.

3257
03:27:02,810 --> 03:27:04,770
I am an angel.

3258
03:27:10,970 --> 03:27:11,970
Oh!

3259
03:27:15,730 --> 03:27:17,730
Uh-oh.

3260
03:27:22,690 --> 03:27:23,370
Oh, shoot.

3261
03:27:25,710 --> 03:27:26,210
Nice.

3262
03:27:26,470 --> 03:27:27,210
Nice parry.

3263
03:27:29,270 --> 03:27:30,270
Ouch,

3264
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:34,250
ouch, ouch.

3265
03:27:34,810 --> 03:27:35,250
Nice.

3266
03:27:36,670 --> 03:27:38,070
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3267
03:27:38,390 --> 03:27:39,770
Ouch, ouch, I tried to dodge.

3268
03:27:42,490 --> 03:27:42,890
Uh...

3269
03:27:43,850 --> 03:27:44,250
Ah!

3270
03:27:44,470 --> 03:27:44,870
Please!

3271
03:27:48,410 --> 03:27:48,810
Ouch!

3272
03:27:48,970 --> 03:27:49,590
Oh my gosh.

3273
03:27:49,930 --> 03:27:51,470
I'm wasting my DT for this.

3274
03:27:53,130 --> 03:27:53,530
Please!

3275
03:27:53,690 --> 03:27:54,690
Oh my gosh, she's so good.

3276
03:27:58,890 --> 03:28:00,250
Okay, my bullets do nothing.

3277
03:28:05,500 --> 03:28:06,180
Oh, shoot.

3278
03:28:06,320 --> 03:28:06,640
Not this.

3279
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:12,020
Come on.

3280
03:28:15,120 --> 03:28:15,840
Please!

3281
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:26,440
I mean...

3282
03:28:27,780 --> 03:28:28,500
Ouch,

3283
03:28:34,770 --> 03:28:35,710
ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3284
03:28:40,790 --> 03:28:41,990
Shall we dance?

3285
03:28:44,610 --> 03:28:45,550
Oh no!

3286
03:28:45,710 --> 03:28:47,250
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

3287
03:28:56,380 --> 03:28:56,840
Wee!

3288
03:29:01,860 --> 03:29:02,580
Oh, no.

3289
03:29:02,840 --> 03:29:03,440
Ah, shoot.

3290
03:29:03,600 --> 03:29:04,260
I missed my charge.

3291
03:29:04,940 --> 03:29:05,800
Oh, no, I didn't.

3292
03:29:06,640 --> 03:29:07,940
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3293
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:09,760
Okay.

3294
03:29:11,140 --> 03:29:13,020
Why do I feel so slow on this?

3295
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:15,160
This...

3296
03:29:15,160 --> 03:29:16,220
Oh, come on, please.

3297
03:29:16,920 --> 03:29:17,180
Ah!

3298
03:29:17,560 --> 03:29:18,680
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

3299
03:29:22,320 --> 03:29:22,780
Ah!

3300
03:29:25,800 --> 03:29:27,740
Oh my god, he has so much health.

3301
03:29:27,760 --> 03:29:28,100
Oh...

3302
03:29:31,120 --> 03:29:31,800
Holy...

3303
03:29:32,760 --> 03:29:33,360
Oh my god.

3304
03:29:33,460 --> 03:29:34,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3305
03:29:43,910 --> 03:29:45,150
What the hell?

3306
03:29:45,550 --> 03:29:46,630
This is sad shit.

3307
03:29:53,090 --> 03:29:53,990
Oh my god.

3308
03:29:57,210 --> 03:29:59,750
Oh, he's too good at dodging.

3309
03:30:07,790 --> 03:30:08,930
Oh my god.

3310
03:30:15,650 --> 03:30:18,390
Ah, guys, I can't dodge it well.

3311
03:30:33,040 --> 03:30:34,520
Oh, you asshole.

3312
03:30:35,680 --> 03:30:37,120
Why did you have to teleport away?

3313
03:30:37,280 --> 03:30:38,240
Right as I DT'd.

3314
03:30:42,750 --> 03:30:43,750
Oh my gosh.

3315
03:30:43,870 --> 03:30:44,490
Oh my gosh.

3316
03:30:44,570 --> 03:30:44,690
Okay.

3317
03:30:46,050 --> 03:30:47,090
That was scary.

3318
03:30:56,210 --> 03:30:58,370
Oh, he does it every time!

3319
03:30:58,750 --> 03:30:59,790
You bastard!

3320
03:31:01,910 --> 03:31:02,770
Oh, shit.

3321
03:31:28,690 --> 03:31:34,230
Yeah, you have your reason to retreat.

3322
03:31:34,370 --> 03:31:34,790
Yeah, yeah.

3323
03:31:35,410 --> 03:31:35,810
Me too.

3324
03:31:36,690 --> 03:31:38,050
That was so close.

3325
03:31:44,210 --> 03:31:45,890
Oh, Nero, please get out of the way.

3326
03:31:53,510 --> 03:31:54,410
Oh, damn it.

3327
03:31:54,470 --> 03:31:56,190
I didn't realize that was the move he was doing.

3328
03:32:13,530 --> 03:32:14,170
Oh, shoot.

3329
03:32:14,270 --> 03:32:14,590
I forgot.

3330
03:32:16,310 --> 03:32:17,350
Oh, I got him!

3331
03:32:17,770 --> 03:32:18,310
I got him!

3332
03:32:18,310 --> 03:32:18,930
I got his ass!

3333
03:32:18,990 --> 03:32:19,570
I got his ass!

3334
03:32:20,270 --> 03:32:21,150
Oh, thank goodness.

3335
03:32:23,070 --> 03:32:23,430
Nice!

3336
03:32:37,980 --> 03:32:38,760
Wait, can I...

3337
03:32:41,860 --> 03:32:42,480
Okay, okay.

3338
03:32:42,640 --> 03:32:43,100
That was good.

3339
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:43,680
Good damage.

3340
03:32:43,800 --> 03:32:44,120
Good damage.

3341
03:32:44,180 --> 03:32:44,520
Good damage.

3342
03:32:48,200 --> 03:32:48,840
Oh, shit.

3343
03:32:51,800 --> 03:32:52,080
Oh, shit.

3344
03:32:52,180 --> 03:32:52,400
Oh, shit.

3345
03:32:52,540 --> 03:32:52,660
Oh, shit.

3346
03:32:57,850 --> 03:32:58,170
Sorry.

3347
03:33:00,190 --> 03:33:00,870
Just in case.

3348
03:33:19,590 --> 03:33:20,570
I'm trying to parry.

3349
03:33:21,510 --> 03:33:21,830
Mother...

3350
03:33:23,190 --> 03:33:24,150
Damn it, I tried.

3351
03:33:27,430 --> 03:33:28,690
Oh, he's too good.

3352
03:33:31,910 --> 03:33:33,370
I think I'm gonna use another.

3353
03:33:33,570 --> 03:33:34,910
I only have one left.

3354
03:33:37,070 --> 03:33:38,110
My head is so sweaty.

3355
03:33:38,830 --> 03:33:40,550
Oh, he's going ham, he is.

3356
03:33:46,670 --> 03:33:47,930
Oh, the holy water.

3357
03:33:48,150 --> 03:33:49,170
Oh my gosh, I have three of them.

3358
03:33:51,290 --> 03:33:52,550
He's right here in front of me, right?

3359
03:33:53,750 --> 03:33:55,810
Let's check where he is first.

3360
03:33:59,710 --> 03:34:00,990
Okay, he's...

3361
03:34:00,990 --> 03:34:01,670
There we go.

3362
03:34:03,690 --> 03:34:04,710
Let's try it.

3363
03:34:11,180 --> 03:34:12,640
I can't believe that worked.

3364
03:34:16,200 --> 03:34:17,080
Splash them.

3365
03:34:21,640 --> 03:34:23,600
I need some water, bad.

3366
03:34:29,360 --> 03:34:30,560
Oh, he does.

3367
03:34:31,180 --> 03:34:31,960
Give it up.

3368
03:34:32,060 --> 03:34:33,140
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

3369
03:34:34,900 --> 03:34:35,620
Credit card.

3370
03:34:39,320 --> 03:34:40,840
Yeah, I know, right?

3371
03:34:41,180 --> 03:34:43,060
I kind of wanted to use the holy water.

3372
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:44,340
Because I was just like...

3373
03:34:44,340 --> 03:34:46,380
Isn't it so funny that like it used...

3374
03:34:46,380 --> 03:34:49,520
That it worked on a guy that said he's an angel.

3375
03:34:55,520 --> 03:34:56,940
Kitty, it's not what you think.

3376
03:34:57,340 --> 03:34:58,140
You still love me, right?

3377
03:34:58,600 --> 03:34:59,460
No, wait.

3378
03:35:00,160 --> 03:35:00,460
Kitty.

3379
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:02,740
This isn't what you think.

3380
03:35:03,080 --> 03:35:04,420
I am Nero.

3381
03:35:04,460 --> 03:35:05,340
Why did you do this?

3382
03:35:05,680 --> 03:35:06,000
No, no.

3383
03:35:06,820 --> 03:35:07,980
No, no, kitty.

3384
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:14,280
You could grab a spear?

3385
03:35:14,320 --> 03:35:14,860
That's crazy.

3386
03:35:15,320 --> 03:35:16,880
To protect you from the truth.

3387
03:35:18,060 --> 03:35:19,760
Nero is a demon.

3388
03:35:19,920 --> 03:35:21,320
Look at the sword this guy uses.

3389
03:35:21,400 --> 03:35:22,340
You think he's an angel?

3390
03:35:25,940 --> 03:35:26,980
Not to worry.

3391
03:35:26,980 --> 03:35:29,000
I have no intentions of harming her.

3392
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:34,840
Wait, you're still gonna trust him?

3393
03:35:35,960 --> 03:35:37,940
Your attachment extends beyond friendship.

3394
03:35:37,940 --> 03:35:40,180
You're still gonna trust this guy who says he's gonna hurt you?

3395
03:35:40,320 --> 03:35:40,700
I can't let them do this.

3396
03:35:41,740 --> 03:35:42,580
Let her go!

3397
03:35:43,060 --> 03:35:43,660
Agnus!

3398
03:35:46,300 --> 03:35:48,480
How dare you use my sister?

3399
03:35:49,400 --> 03:35:50,580
This is my fight.

3400
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:52,500
And I will finish it.

3401
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:55,380
Let her go.

3402
03:35:55,380 --> 03:35:58,440
His holiness predicted your defeat.

3403
03:35:59,220 --> 03:36:03,540
And so ordered that your sister be utilized.

3404
03:36:04,640 --> 03:36:05,080
What?

3405
03:36:10,060 --> 03:36:10,920
Oh my god.

3406
03:36:11,620 --> 03:36:13,740
He's got his fake little halo.

3407
03:36:16,220 --> 03:36:17,620
It's literally his antenna.

3408
03:36:27,010 --> 03:36:27,510
Kitty!

3409
03:36:30,250 --> 03:36:31,390
Use Kitty, eh?

3410
03:36:33,310 --> 03:36:34,370
Where has he taken her?

3411
03:36:34,410 --> 03:36:35,310
Why is he so jacked?

3412
03:36:35,390 --> 03:36:36,150
Back to headquarters?

3413
03:36:37,430 --> 03:36:38,590
I'd assume so.

3414
03:36:39,990 --> 03:36:41,750
Nero, we must set aside this battle.

3415
03:36:42,490 --> 03:36:44,270
Until I find out the truth of this.

3416
03:36:45,410 --> 03:36:47,290
Yeah, you can't even stand up, dude.

3417
03:36:48,210 --> 03:36:49,790
We gotta stop fighting.

3418
03:36:50,010 --> 03:36:51,950
Not because I'm dying or anything.

3419
03:36:52,110 --> 03:36:54,330
But because I gotta, you know, I got stuff to do.

3420
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:01,780
Shield once held by Credo.

3421
03:37:01,780 --> 03:37:04,880
Those who take it up will find a new source of power.

3422
03:37:05,920 --> 03:37:08,600
After completing a buster, continue to hold B.

3423
03:37:09,140 --> 03:37:13,000
By bringing a captured enemy close to you, you can use that enemy as a shield against attacks.

3424
03:37:14,660 --> 03:37:15,540
That's awesome.

3425
03:37:17,080 --> 03:37:19,140
Why do I feel so much faster now?

3426
03:37:19,220 --> 03:37:19,780
What the heck?

3427
03:37:20,980 --> 03:37:22,880
Felt like I was running through jelly before.

3428
03:37:25,180 --> 03:37:25,960
My ears.

3429
03:37:30,040 --> 03:37:31,920
Ah, we didn't get so many.

3430
03:37:32,080 --> 03:37:32,800
That's my fault.

3431
03:37:32,980 --> 03:37:34,340
I used like three items.

3432
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:35,260
I'm sorry, everybody.

3433
03:37:38,580 --> 03:37:39,660
25 minutes.

3434
03:37:42,180 --> 03:37:42,720
Dab.

3435
03:37:43,720 --> 03:37:44,260
Dab.

3436
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:48,380
He was just that fast?

3437
03:37:49,120 --> 03:37:50,000
Is that really the case?

3438
03:37:52,100 --> 03:37:53,000
For you.

3439
03:37:53,280 --> 03:37:54,660
Locate the captive Kyrie.

3440
03:37:58,150 --> 03:37:59,410
I think, guys...

3441
03:38:01,150 --> 03:38:02,050
Hold on one second.

3442
03:38:03,410 --> 03:38:05,530
I didn't get through that many missions today, did I?

3443
03:38:05,610 --> 03:38:06,730
What did I end on before?

3444
03:38:07,570 --> 03:38:10,450
I ended on seven before.

3445
03:38:10,610 --> 03:38:11,990
Oh my gosh, did I only get through...

3446
03:38:11,990 --> 03:38:13,010
Wait, no, not seven.

3447
03:38:13,290 --> 03:38:13,770
What did I end?

3448
03:38:21,630 --> 03:38:22,890
How many missions did I get through?

3449
03:38:23,730 --> 03:38:24,050
Four.

3450
03:38:24,850 --> 03:38:25,430
Oh, okay.

3451
03:38:27,030 --> 03:38:27,630
I was gonna say...

3452
03:38:27,630 --> 03:38:28,470
I ended on four.

3453
03:38:28,590 --> 03:38:29,390
I was gonna say...

3454
03:38:29,390 --> 03:38:30,070
Oh my gosh.

3455
03:38:31,990 --> 03:38:34,290
The missions feel so much longer this time.

3456
03:38:34,590 --> 03:38:37,050
Um, it's my...

3457
03:38:41,590 --> 03:38:43,750
Let me see if I want to do one more or not.

3458
03:38:51,030 --> 03:38:51,810
Let's do one more.

3459
03:38:52,030 --> 03:38:52,670
We got this one.

3460
03:38:52,830 --> 03:38:53,370
Let's do this one.

3461
03:38:54,370 --> 03:38:54,590
Oh!

3462
03:38:55,810 --> 03:38:59,810
I forgot to...

3463
03:39:00,250 --> 03:39:01,590
I forgot to buy stuff.

3464
03:39:10,220 --> 03:39:10,620
Oopsie.

3465
03:39:12,260 --> 03:39:14,180
I forgot to power up.

3466
03:39:14,680 --> 03:39:15,120
Oopsie.

3467
03:39:18,910 --> 03:39:21,270
Yeah, we'll find a statue somewhere, probably.

3468
03:39:23,810 --> 03:39:24,190
Uh-oh.

3469
03:39:30,810 --> 03:39:31,450
What?

3470
03:39:32,150 --> 03:39:32,990
Friendly fire?

3471
03:39:36,820 --> 03:39:38,120
The demons are...

3472
03:39:40,320 --> 03:39:40,920
Oh?

3473
03:39:42,240 --> 03:39:45,890
Oh no.

3474
03:39:46,150 --> 03:39:47,030
What is this thing?

3475
03:39:47,490 --> 03:39:48,130
Oh gosh.

3476
03:39:49,750 --> 03:39:50,430
Uh-oh.

3477
03:39:55,310 --> 03:39:56,150
What are you?

3478
03:40:13,600 --> 03:40:14,820
Oh my god, he's right there!

3479
03:40:14,900 --> 03:40:15,480
He's right there!

3480
03:40:15,840 --> 03:40:16,520
Nero, watch out!

3481
03:40:18,520 --> 03:40:20,100
If I snatch him...

3482
03:40:20,100 --> 03:40:26,100
If I snatch him and hold it...

3483
03:40:26,940 --> 03:40:27,920
Uh, snatch and hold...

3484
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:29,760
I want to use him as a shield.

3485
03:40:43,430 --> 03:40:44,510
Oh, whoops.

3486
03:40:44,670 --> 03:40:45,890
I'm so stupid.

3487
03:40:49,730 --> 03:40:51,290
I can't grab...

3488
03:40:51,290 --> 03:40:52,110
Are they too big?

3489
03:40:52,510 --> 03:40:53,710
Are they too big for me?

3490
03:40:55,490 --> 03:40:56,570
Woo-wee!

3491
03:41:07,180 --> 03:41:08,440
That's insane!

3492
03:41:17,510 --> 03:41:18,630
Oh my god!

3493
03:41:18,630 --> 03:41:19,910
That's so awesome!

3494
03:41:21,690 --> 03:41:22,930
Holy moly!

3495
03:41:24,410 --> 03:41:24,810
Wow!

3496
03:41:28,330 --> 03:41:28,970
Uh-oh.

3497
03:41:29,290 --> 03:41:30,550
We don't need...

3498
03:41:30,550 --> 03:41:31,530
We don't want these.

3499
03:41:32,130 --> 03:41:34,190
Wow, this place is so clean.

3500
03:41:35,770 --> 03:41:38,630
Ah, you should have been the one to fill your dark soul with the light!

3501
03:41:40,110 --> 03:41:40,950
Kind of vibes.

3502
03:41:42,330 --> 03:41:43,610
I'm not gonna lie.

3503
03:41:44,210 --> 03:41:44,430
Oh!

3504
03:41:57,900 --> 03:41:58,860
Oh, oops.

3505
03:42:07,850 --> 03:42:08,570
Oh, whoops.

3506
03:42:08,750 --> 03:42:09,110
Ah, shit.

3507
03:42:22,230 --> 03:42:23,070
Just one more!

3508
03:42:54,150 --> 03:42:54,810
Come on!

3509
03:42:55,110 --> 03:42:55,770
Just one more!

3510
03:42:56,210 --> 03:42:56,530
Ah!

3511
03:42:58,950 --> 03:43:00,290
Try with the gun in the air.

3512
03:43:00,390 --> 03:43:00,630
Ah!

3513
03:43:00,810 --> 03:43:01,370
Oh, wow!

3514
03:43:01,430 --> 03:43:02,110
We broke it!

3515
03:43:03,330 --> 03:43:04,870
I didn't break the other one before.

3516
03:43:05,890 --> 03:43:06,330
Interesting.

3517
03:43:07,530 --> 03:43:09,090
Also, these statues...

3518
03:43:09,090 --> 03:43:10,030
What is that?

3519
03:43:10,070 --> 03:43:10,450
A monkey?

3520
03:43:13,250 --> 03:43:14,350
What is this one?

3521
03:43:16,890 --> 03:43:17,470
Okay.

3522
03:43:19,450 --> 03:43:21,690
Uh, I think we only have the one door.

3523
03:43:22,210 --> 03:43:22,690
Just kidding.

3524
03:43:22,910 --> 03:43:24,550
We have this long hallway.

3525
03:43:25,310 --> 03:43:25,790
What's this thing?

3526
03:43:26,310 --> 03:43:26,410
Oh!

3527
03:43:29,110 --> 03:43:30,110
Ice monkey.

3528
03:43:37,490 --> 03:43:38,070
Wow!

3529
03:43:39,210 --> 03:43:41,370
Looks kind of demonic to me.

3530
03:43:44,390 --> 03:43:44,790
Oh!

3531
03:43:46,930 --> 03:43:48,810
The snake won't let it...

3532
03:43:49,970 --> 03:43:52,330
Looks like he was patting me on the back.

3533
03:43:55,870 --> 03:43:59,210
Oh, no!

3534
03:44:00,090 --> 03:44:01,310
Did that just activate...

3535
03:44:01,310 --> 03:44:03,490
Wait, did that just activate laser beams?

3536
03:44:08,130 --> 03:44:09,510
Oh, hate that.

3537
03:44:09,890 --> 03:44:11,530
Why did that...

3538
03:44:11,530 --> 03:44:12,510
Why did this happen?

3539
03:44:16,250 --> 03:44:18,830
I don't like that.

3540
03:44:22,690 --> 03:44:24,030
Oh, no!

3541
03:44:24,670 --> 03:44:26,150
My game just crashed!

3542
03:44:26,750 --> 03:44:27,890
No way!

3543
03:44:29,410 --> 03:44:30,030
Uh-oh.

3544
03:44:30,470 --> 03:44:32,370
Oh, my game just crashed!

3545
03:44:34,130 --> 03:44:38,150
I wonder if the game doesn't like me playing for so long.

3546
03:44:44,430 --> 03:44:45,390
And it's...

3547
03:44:45,390 --> 03:44:46,090
Hold on, it's tiny.

3548
03:44:46,730 --> 03:44:48,590
Let me make it bigger for you guys.

3549
03:44:54,470 --> 03:44:54,910
Eeeh!

3550
03:44:58,980 --> 03:45:00,560
I don't remember what I had it.

3551
03:45:00,660 --> 03:45:01,280
Maybe this.

3552
03:45:01,540 --> 03:45:01,880
Yeah.

3553
03:45:02,860 --> 03:45:03,740
Oh, just kidding.

3554
03:45:06,860 --> 03:45:07,300
Okay.

3555
03:45:15,760 --> 03:45:17,220
Back to the beginning of the mission.

3556
03:45:17,420 --> 03:45:18,460
Did it not autosave?

3557
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:22,560
I guess we'll see.

3558
03:45:26,060 --> 03:45:27,320
Devil may crash.

3559
03:45:31,320 --> 03:45:32,020
Oh...

3560
03:45:35,820 --> 03:45:36,520
I

3561
03:45:39,910 --> 03:45:42,870
don't think we lost so much progress, I guess.

3562
03:45:50,990 --> 03:45:54,110
I'm gonna have to fight those guys at the beginning again.

3563
03:45:56,530 --> 03:45:57,890
Nah, just the one fight.

3564
03:45:59,270 --> 03:45:59,950
Stinky!

3565
03:46:01,030 --> 03:46:01,990
So stinky.

3566
03:46:18,470 --> 03:46:19,930
Maybe I'll get caliber.

3567
03:46:21,270 --> 03:46:22,590
Have a mid-air...

3568
03:46:27,810 --> 03:46:30,590
Or I just save up for this.

3569
03:46:33,910 --> 03:46:35,150
Caliber's hard to do, really?

3570
03:46:35,730 --> 03:46:37,630
This is just not streak, but in the end...

3571
03:46:44,110 --> 03:46:45,710
Its input is difficult.

3572
03:46:46,330 --> 03:46:46,750
Oh, really?

3573
03:46:47,650 --> 03:46:48,530
It's hard to remember?

3574
03:46:58,140 --> 03:46:59,420
So close to blorb.

3575
03:47:00,840 --> 03:47:02,080
We'll wait for blorb.

3576
03:47:02,460 --> 03:47:04,320
In the end, I'm not gonna do anything.

3577
03:47:05,700 --> 03:47:07,660
In the end, I'm not even gonna do anything.

3578
03:47:10,520 --> 03:47:11,040
Ah...

3579
03:47:12,020 --> 03:47:12,540
Frustrating.

3580
03:47:16,580 --> 03:47:21,680
Look at all this sweet money we almost missed out on, guys!

3581
03:47:37,170 --> 03:47:38,490
Blorb, blorb, blorb.

3582
03:47:38,630 --> 03:47:39,270
Can I skip?

3583
03:47:40,150 --> 03:47:40,470
Okay.

3584
03:47:41,210 --> 03:47:42,650
I'm just gonna skip the cutscenes.

3585
03:47:42,830 --> 03:47:43,610
Hope you guys don't mind.

3586
03:48:09,560 --> 03:48:10,640
They're protecting him!

3587
03:48:10,680 --> 03:48:11,460
That's so messed up.

3588
03:48:12,420 --> 03:48:13,560
It's kind of funny, though.

3589
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:14,400
I like it.

3590
03:48:17,600 --> 03:48:18,040
Nice.

3591
03:48:19,800 --> 03:48:20,960
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3592
03:48:22,840 --> 03:48:23,280
I...

3593
03:48:23,280 --> 03:48:25,540
I have to redo my style thing!

3594
03:48:25,720 --> 03:48:25,840
No!

3595
03:48:26,740 --> 03:48:27,860
That sucks, too.

3596
03:48:41,040 --> 03:48:42,240
Wait, I wanna do it again!

3597
03:48:42,660 --> 03:48:43,080
Come here.

3598
03:48:44,600 --> 03:48:45,300
Where'd you go?

3599
03:48:46,500 --> 03:48:47,140
No!

3600
03:48:47,500 --> 03:48:49,020
I wanna do the cool style!

3601
03:48:49,800 --> 03:48:50,440
Please!

3602
03:48:56,120 --> 03:48:58,980
Ah, we don't get to do it as cool because we're not in...

3603
03:49:03,720 --> 03:49:04,040
Man...

3604
03:49:04,360 --> 03:49:05,320
Combo practice.

3605
03:49:05,700 --> 03:49:06,640
I guess so, yeah.

3606
03:49:06,900 --> 03:49:08,820
Always kind of combo practice.

3607
03:49:15,840 --> 03:49:16,480
Though...

3608
03:49:17,360 --> 03:49:20,800
I am curious what this door leads to before if I...

3609
03:49:20,820 --> 03:49:22,360
Don't activate the lasers.

3610
03:49:22,960 --> 03:49:24,740
If there is anything behind it.

3611
03:49:27,980 --> 03:49:28,660
Oh!

3612
03:49:29,080 --> 03:49:30,580
I missed this over here!

3613
03:49:31,500 --> 03:49:32,880
A devil star!

3614
03:49:33,340 --> 03:49:33,780
Nice.

3615
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:38,180
So we are kind of, you know...

3616
03:49:39,560 --> 03:49:40,720
Okay, it's right here.

3617
03:50:03,710 --> 03:50:05,310
So in the air, you said?

3618
03:50:05,610 --> 03:50:05,950
Like...

3619
03:50:05,950 --> 03:50:07,250
Shoot it in the...

3620
03:50:10,490 --> 03:50:12,010
If I...

3621
03:50:12,010 --> 03:50:13,450
Like that, or...

3622
03:50:15,170 --> 03:50:15,910
Oh, shoot.

3623
03:50:38,440 --> 03:50:40,440
Does all this work?

3624
03:50:53,390 --> 03:50:54,470
Oh, no!

3625
03:51:03,970 --> 03:51:05,110
There we go.

3626
03:51:06,930 --> 03:51:07,430
Smoking!

3627
03:51:21,270 --> 03:51:22,950
We're all revved up now.

3628
03:51:24,210 --> 03:51:25,670
So let's see if this door do...

3629
03:51:25,670 --> 03:51:26,730
Oh, it's just a wall.

3630
03:51:27,870 --> 03:51:28,570
I see, I see.

3631
03:51:29,750 --> 03:51:31,490
I see, I see, I see.

3632
03:51:32,910 --> 03:51:35,500
Oh, I'm wasting the rev on...

3633
03:51:36,850 --> 03:51:38,430
On these things, it's so funny.

3634
03:51:39,890 --> 03:51:40,190
Okay!

3635
03:51:41,350 --> 03:51:42,150
Skip cutscene.

3636
03:51:42,150 --> 03:51:43,570
Skip cutscene.

3637
03:51:43,690 --> 03:51:44,650
Okay, lasers!

3638
03:51:46,190 --> 03:51:46,410
Yay!

3639
03:51:48,830 --> 03:51:49,870
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

3640
03:51:56,190 --> 03:51:57,230
Okay, onwards!

3641
03:51:58,170 --> 03:51:58,710
Why skip?

3642
03:51:58,790 --> 03:51:59,990
Because I already just saw it.

3643
03:52:00,030 --> 03:52:00,810
What are you talking about?

3644
03:52:04,860 --> 03:52:06,600
Oh, I don't like that.

3645
03:52:20,420 --> 03:52:21,340
Ouch, leap!

3646
03:52:23,560 --> 03:52:24,080
Leap!

3647
03:52:26,780 --> 03:52:28,320
They're... They're cycling around me.

3648
03:52:30,800 --> 03:52:31,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3649
03:52:34,120 --> 03:52:36,000
I like their feathers, it's really cool.

3650
03:52:40,960 --> 03:52:42,000
I don't know...

3651
03:52:42,000 --> 03:52:43,120
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

3652
03:52:43,160 --> 03:52:44,880
Oh my god, they're all charging at me at once.

3653
03:52:45,600 --> 03:52:46,400
It's craziness.

3654
03:52:50,240 --> 03:52:52,620
When can I grab their shields?

3655
03:52:52,820 --> 03:52:55,160
Like, I don't understand when I can do that.

3656
03:52:55,440 --> 03:52:56,780
But sometimes I can, and...

3657
03:53:01,790 --> 03:53:03,430
I'm starting to lose it a little bit.

3658
03:53:03,970 --> 03:53:05,530
Starting to get lost in the sauce a little bit.

3659
03:53:05,830 --> 03:53:06,730
Oh, I'm doing it!

3660
03:53:07,170 --> 03:53:07,470
Kinda.

3661
03:53:08,950 --> 03:53:09,890
Oh my god, there's more!

3662
03:53:22,120 --> 03:53:24,060
My eyes are starting to blaze over a little bit.

3663
03:53:30,940 --> 03:53:32,340
Can you get him from behind?

3664
03:53:34,080 --> 03:53:35,580
But even that didn't do it, just them.

3665
03:53:40,410 --> 03:53:42,050
The yellow knights are immune to the shield though.

3666
03:53:42,430 --> 03:53:43,590
Ah, I see, I see.

3667
03:53:48,740 --> 03:53:50,540
Is this slow down time?

3668
03:53:50,860 --> 03:53:51,540
What is this thing?

3669
03:53:52,460 --> 03:53:53,140
It does!

3670
03:53:53,400 --> 03:53:53,920
Look at that!

3671
03:53:54,100 --> 03:53:55,880
It's a hourglass.

3672
03:53:57,100 --> 03:53:58,780
She got that hourglass bod, baby!

3673
03:54:05,260 --> 03:54:06,820
DMC takes up a lot of energy.

3674
03:54:07,560 --> 03:54:08,880
Key of Cronus.

3675
03:54:09,160 --> 03:54:13,460
Possesses a dense magical power needed to manipulate the very fabric of space and time.

3676
03:54:14,340 --> 03:54:17,580
BRB guys, I'm gonna go grab some water real quick.

3677
03:54:18,660 --> 03:54:19,720
Some water, water!

3678
03:54:21,440 --> 03:54:23,140
And then I will be back.

3679
03:54:23,320 --> 03:54:25,720
Also, I'm gonna get a pizza slice.

3680
03:54:26,480 --> 03:54:27,440
Because it's Friday!

3681
03:54:28,700 --> 03:54:29,800
And I made pizza.

3682
03:54:30,480 --> 03:54:34,280
And I'm gonna snack on it for a brief moment before we continue.

3683
03:54:34,920 --> 03:54:37,400
So, a short break.

3684
03:54:41,240 --> 03:54:42,520
I'll leave you with some...

3685
03:54:43,000 --> 03:54:43,620
With some...

3686
03:54:44,300 --> 03:54:44,820
What do you call it?

3687
03:54:44,920 --> 03:54:46,300
Devil May Cry ambiance.

3688
03:54:46,860 --> 03:54:47,320
Thank you, BRB.

3689
03:56:57,960 --> 03:56:59,420
Ev, I am back.

3690
03:57:02,240 --> 03:57:03,540
I'm back, but...

3691
03:57:05,800 --> 03:57:07,820
My cat's in here, so she'll probably...

3692
03:57:12,360 --> 03:57:14,720
She'll probably want out in like a second.

3693
03:57:22,960 --> 03:57:24,700
I'm scarfing it down.

3694
03:57:33,950 --> 03:57:35,630
This is a regular cheese pizza.

3695
03:57:36,470 --> 03:57:37,330
Nothing special.

3696
03:57:39,970 --> 03:57:41,890
My store didn't have anything special.

3697
03:57:52,330 --> 03:57:53,870
Let's dance on pineapple pizza.

3698
03:57:54,770 --> 03:57:56,230
I love pineapple pizza.

3699
03:57:57,050 --> 03:57:58,830
If you don't like it, I'll eat all of it.

3700
03:57:59,330 --> 03:57:59,570
Okay.

3701
03:58:04,770 --> 03:58:10,410
The device is incomplete, so it will only remain for a short amount of time while I'm in possession of the Kronos Press B near the Kronos Slicer.

3702
03:58:11,750 --> 03:58:11,930
Okay.

3703
03:58:17,010 --> 03:58:18,580
We came from that side, so...

3704
03:58:22,890 --> 03:58:23,710
Nero, careful.

3705
03:58:37,980 --> 03:58:39,880
Oh, I need to go close to this thing?

3706
03:58:44,110 --> 03:58:44,970
I made it!

3707
03:58:58,710 --> 03:58:59,130
Nice!

3708
03:58:59,690 --> 03:59:00,110
Oh!

3709
03:59:01,410 --> 03:59:02,230
Oh, dang it.

3710
03:59:02,910 --> 03:59:04,470
I thought that was a statue.

3711
03:59:04,930 --> 03:59:05,470
Wait a second.

3712
03:59:06,370 --> 03:59:07,610
There is a statue in here.

3713
03:59:12,250 --> 03:59:13,070
Over yonder.

3714
03:59:16,190 --> 03:59:16,790
Over here?

3715
03:59:18,670 --> 03:59:19,090
Where?

3716
03:59:19,430 --> 03:59:20,810
I can't read the map at all.

3717
03:59:22,670 --> 03:59:23,090
Oh

3718
03:59:44,430 --> 03:59:46,890
no, we're gonna have to fight in here, huh?

3719
03:59:49,470 --> 03:59:50,690
There they are.

3720
04:00:01,330 --> 04:00:03,890
And after you guys, who will it be next, huh?

3721
04:00:07,070 --> 04:00:08,310
It will be after.

3722
04:00:12,130 --> 04:00:13,530
Why isn't this thing moving?

3723
04:00:15,730 --> 04:00:16,050
Hello?

3724
04:00:17,210 --> 04:00:18,250
Oh, there it goes.

3725
04:00:19,730 --> 04:00:20,930
It will be me!

3726
04:00:22,350 --> 04:00:22,830
Oh wow.

3727
04:00:25,990 --> 04:00:26,710
Oh no.

3728
04:00:28,710 --> 04:00:30,830
Wait, I saw a blower piece somewhere.

3729
04:00:32,030 --> 04:00:33,010
I lost it though.

3730
04:00:33,610 --> 04:00:34,790
I lost where it was.

3731
04:00:35,890 --> 04:00:37,430
Was it over yonder, over here?

3732
04:00:37,870 --> 04:00:39,090
Why do I keep saying yonder?

3733
04:00:39,890 --> 04:00:41,190
Like I'm from Prairie.

3734
04:00:41,750 --> 04:00:45,850
A little...

3735
04:00:47,990 --> 04:00:48,870
Ouch!

3736
04:00:51,090 --> 04:00:52,790
Even, oh, there's three of them.

3737
04:00:52,890 --> 04:00:53,350
Ouch!

3738
04:00:53,850 --> 04:00:54,570
Oh, that worked.

3739
04:00:54,750 --> 04:00:55,030
Whatever.

3740
04:00:56,070 --> 04:00:56,730
Oh, there it is.

3741
04:01:03,120 --> 04:01:03,460
Hi!

3742
04:01:03,460 --> 04:01:04,080
How do I get to it?

3743
04:01:08,210 --> 04:01:09,400
My brain is starting to go...

3744
04:01:17,030 --> 04:01:17,970
I was taking a sippy.

3745
04:01:23,810 --> 04:01:25,230
We're going through like the...

3746
04:01:25,230 --> 04:01:25,950
Oh my goodness.

3747
04:01:27,190 --> 04:01:28,680
Oh my gosh, we're going through like the whole...

3748
04:01:32,950 --> 04:01:33,330
Like...

3749
04:01:35,370 --> 04:01:36,690
Catalog of monsters here.

3750
04:01:42,930 --> 04:01:43,370
Wee!

3751
04:01:43,750 --> 04:01:44,190
Get

3752
04:01:48,240 --> 04:01:50,220
lost!

3753
04:02:00,590 --> 04:02:02,530
Oh yeah, use DT, you're so right.

3754
04:02:10,270 --> 04:02:10,990
What, that's it?

3755
04:02:11,430 --> 04:02:12,030
There's no more?

3756
04:02:12,730 --> 04:02:13,230
Oh, okay.

3757
04:02:14,150 --> 04:02:15,070
I thought there was one more.

3758
04:02:23,310 --> 04:02:24,510
Okay, sorry guys.

3759
04:02:24,710 --> 04:02:26,070
I ate my pizza so fast.

3760
04:02:27,090 --> 04:02:27,690
All right.

3761
04:02:32,090 --> 04:02:33,090
Run, run, run, run.

3762
04:02:33,250 --> 04:02:35,930
Oh, uh, run, uh, run, run, run, run.

3763
04:02:36,350 --> 04:02:36,810
Run, run.

3764
04:02:38,110 --> 04:02:38,850
Run, run.

3765
04:02:39,270 --> 04:02:41,450
Run, run.

3766
04:02:42,750 --> 04:02:43,630
We made it.

3767
04:02:44,570 --> 04:02:45,950
What about that blorb though?

3768
04:02:46,030 --> 04:02:47,070
I wonder how I was supposed to get it.

3769
04:02:49,750 --> 04:02:50,430
Pizza speedrun.

3770
04:03:08,850 --> 04:03:09,290
Nice.

3771
04:03:09,590 --> 04:03:10,450
Damn, we're killing it.

3772
04:03:28,530 --> 04:03:30,750
The first guys gave us health, but...

3773
04:03:31,330 --> 04:03:32,990
Like the clown guys, but...

3774
04:03:34,850 --> 04:03:35,530
Excuse me.

3775
04:03:39,130 --> 04:03:39,690
More?

3776
04:03:39,990 --> 04:03:41,550
Nope, just a dramatic death.

3777
04:03:43,090 --> 04:03:44,550
I do wonder about the blorbs.

3778
04:03:45,630 --> 04:03:47,570
I think I missed my opportunity.

3779
04:03:48,610 --> 04:03:49,490
It's so sad.

3780
04:03:51,030 --> 04:03:52,030
It's all right though.

3781
04:03:52,130 --> 04:03:53,290
Oh, wow, how kind.

3782
04:03:53,470 --> 04:03:53,730
Uh-oh.

3783
04:03:54,250 --> 04:03:55,490
That means there's gonna be a boss here.

3784
04:03:57,450 --> 04:03:59,050
Oh, wait, am I fighting...

3785
04:03:59,050 --> 04:04:00,470
Wait, I said find Kitty.

3786
04:04:00,630 --> 04:04:03,150
Am I fighting Mothman here?

3787
04:04:03,770 --> 04:04:04,570
Oh, no.

3788
04:04:04,870 --> 04:04:06,670
Yeah, we can buy the last blorb finally.

3789
04:04:09,070 --> 04:04:09,470
Yippee!

3790
04:04:10,510 --> 04:04:11,790
Oops, that's a victory.

3791
04:04:14,290 --> 04:04:16,770
Go back to the other side of the door for the blorb.

3792
04:04:16,770 --> 04:04:17,590
Really?

3793
04:04:20,530 --> 04:04:24,190
Wait, it says six out of six, but it'll let me buy it?

3794
04:04:25,410 --> 04:04:26,550
Are you serious?

3795
04:04:31,940 --> 04:04:33,460
I see no blorb.

3796
04:04:40,910 --> 04:04:42,210
Oh, it's gone again.

3797
04:04:46,320 --> 04:04:47,820
I hate chairs!

3798
04:04:48,100 --> 04:04:50,160
No, it gave us nothing!

3799
04:04:50,580 --> 04:04:51,580
How rude!

3800
04:04:52,420 --> 04:04:54,320
No way, there's nothing here?

3801
04:04:54,860 --> 04:04:56,140
No blorbs at all?

3802
04:05:00,910 --> 04:05:02,090
Oh boy, boss fight.

3803
04:05:02,390 --> 04:05:03,350
I should have bought some...

3804
04:05:03,350 --> 04:05:04,360
Maybe I should have bought some...

3805
04:05:06,150 --> 04:05:06,570
stars.

3806
04:05:16,890 --> 04:05:18,110
This is a hard fight.

3807
04:05:26,930 --> 04:05:30,070
He's as easy on you as I was last time.

3808
04:05:31,750 --> 04:05:34,610
If I have to kill you to save Kirie...

3809
04:05:37,410 --> 04:05:38,450
Let's roam!

3810
04:05:43,300 --> 04:05:43,820
Kirie!

3811
04:05:52,650 --> 04:05:53,170
Holy...

3812
04:05:55,270 --> 04:05:56,510
Oh, he's bug zapping.

3813
04:05:57,830 --> 04:05:59,750
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3814
04:06:00,170 --> 04:06:01,210
Oh, it's these guys.

3815
04:06:01,490 --> 04:06:02,150
Oh my gosh.

3816
04:06:10,450 --> 04:06:11,270
Wait, ah.

3817
04:06:11,870 --> 04:06:12,290
Dang it.

3818
04:06:12,730 --> 04:06:14,190
I think I missed my opportunity.

3819
04:06:20,460 --> 04:06:20,800
Yeah!

3820
04:06:31,200 --> 04:06:31,720
Yeah.

3821
04:06:35,860 --> 04:06:36,860
My strength what?

3822
04:06:38,140 --> 04:06:39,880
I'm just gonna do what we did last time.

3823
04:06:44,960 --> 04:06:45,480
Ouch!

3824
04:06:46,000 --> 04:06:47,320
Oh no!

3825
04:06:48,060 --> 04:06:48,720
What is he eating?

3826
04:06:50,600 --> 04:06:51,640
He re...

3827
04:06:51,640 --> 04:06:52,200
He healed.

3828
04:06:52,300 --> 04:06:53,460
Oh my gosh, no way.

3829
04:06:55,160 --> 04:06:58,190
How dare you.

3830
04:07:32,180 --> 04:07:34,000
I don't like this fight.

3831
04:07:34,800 --> 04:07:36,420
I don't like this fight already.

3832
04:07:40,240 --> 04:07:42,660
I have to avoid that 100%.

3833
04:07:48,410 --> 04:07:50,270
Oh my gosh.

3834
04:08:20,390 --> 04:08:21,710
Ah, I got him though.

3835
04:08:25,920 --> 04:08:27,380
Big damage.

3836
04:08:34,640 --> 04:08:35,540
Big damage.

3837
04:08:43,300 --> 04:08:43,820
No.

3838
04:08:45,300 --> 04:08:45,700
No.

3839
04:08:46,560 --> 04:08:47,880
I'm not listening to you.

3840
04:08:48,580 --> 04:08:48,760
No.

3841
04:08:55,280 --> 04:08:56,320
What the hell?

3842
04:09:07,790 --> 04:09:10,790
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3843
04:09:17,630 --> 04:09:19,310
Oh, I'm so dead.

3844
04:09:19,590 --> 04:09:20,530
This is it guys.

3845
04:09:21,070 --> 04:09:22,110
There's no way.

3846
04:09:24,350 --> 04:09:25,010
That's it.

3847
04:09:26,410 --> 04:09:28,090
Oh, you're so close.

3848
04:09:34,490 --> 04:09:35,990
Oh, I still got points though.

3849
04:09:36,050 --> 04:09:36,810
That's kind of nice.

3850
04:09:40,010 --> 04:09:41,450
Abandon all hope.

3851
04:09:45,190 --> 04:09:46,030
Wait, do I...

3852
04:09:46,030 --> 04:09:46,550
Did I actually?

3853
04:09:47,230 --> 04:09:48,090
Skill up.

3854
04:09:48,550 --> 04:09:49,170
Wait, did it...

3855
04:09:49,170 --> 04:09:50,410
It didn't refund everything, did it?

3856
04:09:51,330 --> 04:09:51,690
No.

3857
04:09:52,490 --> 04:09:53,050
Oh, wow.

3858
04:09:53,790 --> 04:09:54,250
Neat.

3859
04:09:54,950 --> 04:09:55,790
Good try though.

3860
04:09:56,070 --> 04:09:58,490
That was my first...

3861
04:09:59,310 --> 04:10:00,110
Well, no.

3862
04:10:00,550 --> 04:10:01,550
I did game over.

3863
04:10:01,730 --> 04:10:02,770
But I had the...

3864
04:10:03,370 --> 04:10:04,330
Maybe I get a...

3865
04:10:04,910 --> 04:10:06,490
I don't have enough for a gorb.

3866
04:10:10,240 --> 04:10:12,720
If I had enough for a gorb, I was gonna say.

3867
04:10:13,440 --> 04:10:15,520
That would have been the perfect spot for one.

3868
04:10:15,920 --> 04:10:16,180
Shoot.

3869
04:10:17,020 --> 04:10:18,340
Ah, that sucks.

3870
04:10:19,280 --> 04:10:19,800
Oh.

3871
04:10:23,760 --> 04:10:24,280
But...

3872
04:10:24,280 --> 04:10:25,100
I can buy...

3873
04:10:26,560 --> 04:10:27,900
A vital star.

3874
04:10:31,630 --> 04:10:34,250
I think I'll get a M vital star and then...

3875
04:10:35,930 --> 04:10:36,450
Um...

3876
04:10:36,450 --> 04:10:38,410
That should be enough.

3877
04:10:41,950 --> 04:10:43,570
You can DT out of the heal your...

3878
04:10:43,570 --> 04:10:44,790
Oh, I didn't see that.

3879
04:10:44,870 --> 04:10:45,210
Thank you.

3880
04:10:45,850 --> 04:10:47,270
I will try to remember that.

3881
04:10:58,210 --> 04:10:59,810
It's only 1,000 more.

3882
04:11:03,310 --> 04:11:04,450
Oh, I did buy it.

3883
04:11:04,530 --> 04:11:04,610
Okay.

3884
04:11:31,000 --> 04:11:31,400
Ouch.

3885
04:11:31,980 --> 04:11:34,160
No, we won't.

3886
04:11:34,660 --> 04:11:36,520
Your strength will not be yours.

3887
04:11:36,800 --> 04:11:37,380
Or my strength...

3888
04:11:38,080 --> 04:11:39,320
Is not yours.

3889
04:11:43,610 --> 04:11:46,650
I just like to have to make sure I have enough DT on hand, you know?

3890
04:11:49,770 --> 04:11:50,830
He's such a weenie.

3891
04:11:54,590 --> 04:11:55,710
He's such a weenie.

3892
04:11:55,870 --> 04:11:56,270
Oh.

3893
04:12:35,540 --> 04:12:37,700
I'm just being really hyper-aggressive here.

3894
04:12:38,980 --> 04:12:40,700
I'm being like hyper-aggressive.

3895
04:12:41,960 --> 04:12:43,940
I know I gotta like get out of the way, but...

3896
04:12:55,150 --> 04:12:56,430
Oh my gosh.

3897
04:12:57,730 --> 04:12:58,250
Um...

3898
04:12:59,330 --> 04:13:00,870
It's definitely working.

3899
04:13:05,170 --> 04:13:07,450
Do you think if I DT, I'll heal enough?

3900
04:13:08,470 --> 04:13:09,230
Okay, it stopped.

3901
04:13:09,490 --> 04:13:12,210
Okay, it does not work in phase 2.

3902
04:13:16,450 --> 04:13:17,290
Star abusing?

3903
04:13:17,490 --> 04:13:17,690
Why?

3904
04:13:17,890 --> 04:13:20,890
How is it abusive if they're there to buy?

3905
04:13:22,670 --> 04:13:24,270
I think if you DT, you might kill him.

3906
04:13:24,510 --> 04:13:25,490
All right, let's try it.

3907
04:13:34,920 --> 04:13:35,360
There.

3908
04:13:35,620 --> 04:13:36,440
That might be it.

3909
04:13:36,440 --> 04:13:37,300
That might be it.

3910
04:13:37,680 --> 04:13:38,440
That might be it.

3911
04:13:40,200 --> 04:13:40,660
Hopefully...

3912
04:13:40,660 --> 04:13:40,900
Oh!

3913
04:13:51,020 --> 04:13:51,320
Nice!

3914
04:13:56,000 --> 04:13:57,820
I didn't have to use the star!

3915
04:13:58,420 --> 04:14:04,000
I was saving the...

3916
04:14:06,050 --> 04:14:11,930
I was saving the DT just in case I needed to get out of a grab, but I didn't have to.

3917
04:14:27,870 --> 04:14:29,310
God, they're so cool.

3918
04:14:29,910 --> 04:14:31,450
They're so cool looking.

3919
04:14:32,070 --> 04:14:33,550
The night demons, I love them.

3920
04:14:37,890 --> 04:14:39,030
They stole the girl!

3921
04:14:40,650 --> 04:14:41,090
GTA!

3922
04:14:43,790 --> 04:14:44,270
Damn.

3923
04:14:45,090 --> 04:14:45,710
Oh, damn.

3924
04:14:46,210 --> 04:14:46,510
Oh,

3925
04:14:59,420 --> 04:14:59,640
sorry.

3926
04:14:59,780 --> 04:15:00,000
My bad.

3927
04:15:00,200 --> 04:15:00,560
Oh my gosh.

3928
04:15:00,660 --> 04:15:01,140
What just happened?

3929
04:15:03,920 --> 04:15:04,340
Sorry.

3930
04:15:12,930 --> 04:15:13,210
No!

3931
04:15:16,290 --> 04:15:17,110
Yeah, baby.

3932
04:15:23,260 --> 04:15:24,100
No.

3933
04:15:25,100 --> 04:15:26,020
The necklace.

3934
04:15:33,080 --> 04:15:33,920
No!

3935
04:15:34,800 --> 04:15:36,020
She was wearing it!

3936
04:15:36,420 --> 04:15:38,280
She was wearing the necklace!

3937
04:15:38,420 --> 04:15:39,000
I give up!

3938
04:15:58,950 --> 04:15:59,790
Nero!

3939
04:16:04,640 --> 04:16:06,600
What rorbs did I miss?

3940
04:16:12,590 --> 04:16:13,110
Damn.

3941
04:16:16,670 --> 04:16:17,230
Yeah!

3942
04:16:24,030 --> 04:16:26,090
So then we got through two bosses today.

3943
04:16:26,130 --> 04:16:26,390
Awesome.

3944
04:16:27,670 --> 04:16:28,110
Good stuff.

3945
04:16:28,190 --> 04:16:28,670
Good stuff.

3946
04:16:29,330 --> 04:16:30,530
Then I will end it here.

3947
04:16:34,750 --> 04:16:36,490
And we'll do the...

3948
04:16:36,490 --> 04:16:38,010
We'll see the cutscene next time.

3949
04:16:40,550 --> 04:16:41,790
Return to title screen.

3950
04:16:41,970 --> 04:16:42,350
Yes!

3951
04:16:43,590 --> 04:16:44,710
The game...

3952
04:16:44,710 --> 04:16:47,470
The game tested us with crashing.

3953
04:16:47,950 --> 04:16:51,610
I guess after a couple hours it crashes because it did that last time too.

3954
04:16:52,370 --> 04:16:52,930
Funny.

3955
04:16:54,250 --> 04:16:55,350
Lots of progress made today.

3956
04:16:55,490 --> 04:16:55,870
Yeah!

3957
04:16:56,210 --> 04:16:58,150
We're on 10 out of 20?

3958
04:17:00,510 --> 04:17:01,070
So...

3959
04:17:01,070 --> 04:17:03,030
Once we finish 10, we'll be halfway there.

3960
04:17:06,130 --> 04:17:07,250
Memory leak, maybe?

3961
04:17:07,970 --> 04:17:08,350
I don't know.

3962
04:17:08,730 --> 04:17:09,730
Possibly, right?

3963
04:17:14,650 --> 04:17:15,330
Hmm...

3964
04:17:15,330 --> 04:17:16,010
Four bosses?

3965
04:17:18,450 --> 04:17:19,490
Oh, that's right!

3966
04:17:19,550 --> 04:17:20,470
Because we took down...

3967
04:17:22,630 --> 04:17:23,310
Uh...

3968
04:17:23,310 --> 04:17:25,150
Credit card...

3969
04:17:25,150 --> 04:17:25,730
What's that guy?

3970
04:17:28,810 --> 04:17:29,490
Uh...

3971
04:17:30,830 --> 04:17:31,950
Don't tell me.

3972
04:17:33,890 --> 04:17:34,230
Cor...

3973
04:17:36,550 --> 04:17:37,230
Corbo...

3974
04:17:37,230 --> 04:17:38,510
What's his name?

3975
04:17:38,910 --> 04:17:39,590
Uh...

3976
04:17:40,810 --> 04:17:41,150
Kelly...

3977
04:17:41,690 --> 04:17:42,710
Don't say it.

3978
04:17:42,810 --> 04:17:43,370
Unless...

3979
04:17:43,370 --> 04:17:44,650
I'm not looking at chat.

3980
04:17:45,550 --> 04:17:46,170
Ca...

3981
04:17:46,170 --> 04:17:47,690
Not Kyle, obviously.

3982
04:17:49,490 --> 04:17:50,130
Uh...

3983
04:17:54,190 --> 04:17:54,910
Hmm...

3984
04:17:54,910 --> 04:17:55,450
I give up.

3985
04:17:58,210 --> 04:17:58,850
Caleb?

3986
04:17:59,130 --> 04:17:59,390
No!

3987
04:18:00,410 --> 04:18:01,550
What's his name?

3988
04:18:03,170 --> 04:18:03,810
Credo!

3989
04:18:05,170 --> 04:18:05,670
Was it cre...

3990
04:18:05,670 --> 04:18:06,370
Wait, was it Credo?

3991
04:18:06,950 --> 04:18:07,930
Did I get it right?

3992
04:18:08,410 --> 04:18:08,730
Actually?

3993
04:18:09,590 --> 04:18:10,230
Credo!

3994
04:18:10,990 --> 04:18:11,930
Code Vushi!

3995
04:18:12,090 --> 04:18:13,010
Thank you so much for the...

3996
04:18:13,010 --> 04:18:13,990
Thank you!

3997
04:18:13,990 --> 04:18:15,190
Thank you so much!

3998
04:18:15,270 --> 04:18:16,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3999
04:18:16,110 --> 04:18:16,830
Holy moly!

4000
04:18:18,350 --> 04:18:18,750
Wait, two?

4001
04:18:20,310 --> 04:18:20,950
Heck yeah!

4002
04:18:25,680 --> 04:18:27,980
Yeah, when do we get to see Lady and Trish?

4003
04:18:29,580 --> 04:18:30,860
Oh my gosh!

4004
04:18:31,260 --> 04:18:33,180
I'm just punching the heck out of Dante.

4005
04:18:33,320 --> 04:18:33,780
So funny.

4006
04:18:35,340 --> 04:18:36,140
Credit card...

4007
04:18:36,140 --> 04:18:37,280
And I mean, that was super fun stream.

4008
04:18:37,320 --> 04:18:37,800
Thank you!

4009
04:18:41,080 --> 04:18:42,260
Um, this is fun.

4010
04:18:44,160 --> 04:18:44,560
Uh...

4011
04:18:44,560 --> 04:18:46,100
I might be around later.

4012
04:18:48,360 --> 04:18:48,740
So...

4013
04:18:49,120 --> 04:18:49,500
Um...

4014
04:18:49,500 --> 04:18:50,540
If I see you, I'll see you.

4015
04:18:50,680 --> 04:18:50,760
Oh!

4016
04:18:52,580 --> 04:18:52,960
Um...

4017
04:18:52,960 --> 04:18:54,460
Yeah, we made good practice today!

4018
04:18:56,000 --> 04:18:56,380
Um...

4019
04:18:56,380 --> 04:18:57,340
Wait, so we bought...

4020
04:18:57,340 --> 04:18:59,420
We beat Snake Lady.

4021
04:18:59,740 --> 04:19:01,340
We beat Credo.

4022
04:19:01,480 --> 04:19:02,920
We beat Mothman.

4023
04:19:03,200 --> 04:19:03,580
Pizza!

4024
04:19:04,600 --> 04:19:06,160
What was the last one we beat?

4025
04:19:15,370 --> 04:19:16,530
Beat Mothman twice.

4026
04:19:16,670 --> 04:19:17,990
Oh, I guess yeah, that does count.

4027
04:19:18,530 --> 04:19:19,450
It was such an easy fight.

4028
04:19:19,790 --> 04:19:21,230
I don't even think of it as a bush fight.

4029
04:19:22,130 --> 04:19:22,530
Hehehehe.

4030
04:19:22,690 --> 04:19:23,250
No, I'm just kidding.

4031
04:19:25,050 --> 04:19:25,450
Um...

4032
04:19:25,450 --> 04:19:26,770
Yeah, that is four boss fights.

4033
04:19:26,990 --> 04:19:28,310
Wow, we're killing it, you guys.

4034
04:19:29,790 --> 04:19:31,430
Thank you so much!

4035
04:19:31,490 --> 04:19:32,410
This is fun.

4036
04:19:32,490 --> 04:19:38,170
I'll see you next week for more Devil May Cry 4.

4037
04:19:39,470 --> 04:19:39,870
Yay!

4038
04:19:44,810 --> 04:19:45,850
Oh, these are...

4039
04:19:45,850 --> 04:19:47,030
These are spoilers, maybe?

4040
04:19:48,130 --> 04:19:49,050
Well, spoilers, maybe?

4041
04:19:49,150 --> 04:19:49,610
I'm not looking.

4042
04:19:51,790 --> 04:19:52,350
Otsumita!

4043
04:19:52,850 --> 04:19:53,870
Thank you, guys!

4044
04:19:53,990 --> 04:19:54,970
Thank you, thank you!

4045
04:19:56,550 --> 04:19:57,390
Bye-bye!

4046
04:19:59,010 --> 04:20:00,070
Oh, we just saw that part.

4047
04:20:00,370 --> 04:20:00,790
Oh, wow!

4048
04:20:01,450 --> 04:20:01,630
Okay.

4049
04:20:02,370 --> 04:20:02,910
Yeah!

4050
04:20:03,110 --> 04:20:03,710
Bye-bye!
