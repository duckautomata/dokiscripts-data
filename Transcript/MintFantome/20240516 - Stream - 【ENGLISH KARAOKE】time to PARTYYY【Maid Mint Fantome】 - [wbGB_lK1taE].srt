00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,000
Hi.

2
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,280
Hi.

3
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey.

4
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,120
Hi.

5
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,240
I'm eating.

6
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm eating right now.

7
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,060
Hold on.

8
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,440
One

9
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,550
more little noodle.

10
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,250
One more little...

11
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,310
Sorry.

12
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,200
I didn't know you could see that.

13
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,640
Why is there a box on my face?

14
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,400
And the karaoke box over the...

15
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,300
Stop it!

16
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
Stop looking!

17
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,020
Actually, I think I need to do the...

18
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,760
You know what?

19
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,880
Screw you guys.

20
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,770
Are you ready to be nice now?

21
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,250
Are we ready?

22
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,610
To party!

23
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,630
Karaoke time!

24
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,650
Yippee!

25
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,790
I don't know what to sing at all.

26
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,010
I don't know what to sing at all.

27
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,590
I have like no list at all.

28
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,710
We're singing whatever we want, baby.

29
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,910
Some things, if they're not on KaraFan, I can probably find them on YouTube.

30
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,490
Andrico, thanks for the 10 gift tours!

31
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,790
Country Roads!

32
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,460
Hey KSTF2, thanks for the 20 gifted!

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,700
You know what?

34
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,640
Let's start with a little Country Roads warm up.

35
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,020
Country Roads!

36
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,840
Take me home.

37
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,340
I'll do this as a test.

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,660
Sound test too.

39
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,320
Because...

40
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,920
No, no!

41
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,540
Oh.

42
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,300
Oh my god.

43
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,700
So in my...

44
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,860
Almost.

45
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,300
Hey.

46
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,560
Oh my god.

47
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,960
Oh my god.

48
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,300
West Virginia.

49
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,500
Blue Ridge Mountains.

50
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,040
Shenandoah River.

51
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,960
Life is old there.

52
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
Older than the trees.

53
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,600
Younger than the mountains.

54
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
Blowing like a breeze.

55
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,160
Country Roads.

56
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,320
Take me home to the place.

57
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
I'll do this as a test.

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,680
Stay hydrated, everybody!

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:06:01,240
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

60
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:11,100
Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong.

61
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,220
West Virginia, mountain mama.

62
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,180
Take me home.

63
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,240
Country roads.

64
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,760
I hear her voice in the morning hours.

65
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,780
She calls me.

66
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,940
The radio reminds me of my home far away.

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,620
Driving down the road, I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday.

68
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,800
Yesterday.

69
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,160
Country roads.

70
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,460
Take me home.

71
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,680
To the place I belong.

72
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,880
West Virginia, mountain mama.

73
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,060
Take me home.

74
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,740
Country roads.

75
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
One more time!

76
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,040
Country roads.

77
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,000
Take me home.

78
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,780
To the place.

79
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,420
To the place I belong.

80
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,060
I'm home.

81
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,360
To the place I belong.

82
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,340
West Virginia, mountain mama.

83
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,860
Take me home.

84
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,360
Country roads.

85
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,580
Take me home.

86
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,420
Country roads.

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,420
Take me home.

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Yee-haw!

89
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Yee-haw, everybody.

90
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,940
Yee-haw!

91
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,420
How was the audio on that?

92
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,340
Oh wait, I forgot to do a set list.

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,700
One.

94
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,020
Country roads.

95
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,120
Actually, I don't want it on the... let's do it to the left.

96
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,900
To the left, to the left.

97
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,900
Everything you own in a box to the left.

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,000
Audio's perfect, audio's good, sounds great!

99
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,400
Yee-haw, partner!

100
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,560
Yee-yup!

101
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,700
You mighta look and mighta find here today.

102
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,240
Can you sing in Kermit voice?

103
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,840
What would you want me to sing in Kermit voice?

104
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,140
Healing my soul.

105
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,820
I'm gonna move you guys over a little bit.

106
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,340
Actually, I'm gonna move you guys right here.

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,520
Yay!

108
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,980
Yee-yup!

109
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
And also, I'm gonna block how many people are watching.

110
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,600
I usually do, but...

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
The way I had it before.

112
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,180
California girls.

113
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,620
California girls are running around...

114
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,100
Thank you, kindly partner.

115
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
California girls.

116
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,260
By Katy Perry.

117
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,940
As sung by Kermit.

118
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,860
As sung by Kermit.

119
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,180
Kermit voice.

120
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,500
Um...

121
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,300
Um...

122
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,860
Okay...

123
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,280
I think you can do this.

124
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,520
Greetings, loved ones.

125
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,420
Greetings.

126
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,180
Let's take a journey.

127
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,120
I know a place.

128
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,620
Where the grass is really greener.

129
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,100
Warm.

130
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,660
Wet and wild.

131
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,860
There must be something.

132
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,290
Sippin' gin and juice.

133
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,890
Let's go.

134
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,010
Playing underneath the palm trees.

135
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,370
The boys...

136
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,290
Break their necks.

137
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,650
Try to creep a little sneak peek.

138
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,810
You could travel the world.

139
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,610
But nothing comes close to the golden coast.

140
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,870
Once you party with Frogbert.

141
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,430
You'll be falling in love.

142
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,010
Oh, oh, oh.

143
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,890
California frogs were unpretentious.

144
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,290
Daisy Dukes.

145
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,990
Bikinis on top.

146
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,850
Sun-kissed skin.

147
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,690
So hot.

148
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,110
We'll melt your popsicle.

149
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,030
Oh, oh, oh.

150
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,210
California frogs.

151
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,670
We're undeniable.

152
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,530
Fine, fresh, fierce.

153
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,430
We got it on lock.

154
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,510
West Coast represent.

155
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,950
Put your hands up.

156
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,770
Peach?

157
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,130
Why is it so bright?

158
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,370
We don't mind sand in our stilettos.

159
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,730
We freak.

160
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,670
In my jeep.

161
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,750
Snoop Doggy Dog on the stereo.

162
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,290
Oh, oh.

163
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,310
You could travel the world.

164
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,110
But nothing comes close to the golden coast.

165
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,210
Once you party with Frogbert.

166
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,990
You'll be falling in love.

167
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,770
Oh, oh, oh.

168
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,790
California frogs were unpretentious.

169
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,730
Daisy Dukes.

170
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:26,930
Bikinis on top.

171
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,290
Sun-kissed skin.

172
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,090
So hot.

173
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,590
We'll melt your popsicle.

174
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,310
Oh, oh.

175
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,470
Oh, oh.

176
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,790
California girls.

177
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,130
We're undeniable.

178
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,950
Fine, fresh, fierce.

179
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,870
We got it on lock.

180
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,930
West Coast represent.

181
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,790
I don't remember how this song goes.

182
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,570
I'm just listening to the harmony.

183
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,930
Tone 10.

184
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,750
Batten ready.

185
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,110
Wait.

186
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:56,910
No

187
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:00,850
one's happy.

188
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:01,550
She's all...

189
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,620
She's trying to be friendly.

190
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,080
When it's beach and Palm Springs.

191
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,700
Summertime is everything.

192
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,840
Homeboys hanging out.

193
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,780
All that ass hanging out.

194
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,700
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis.

195
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,740
No weenies.

196
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,880
It's just the king and the queenie.

197
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,660
Katie, my lady, look here.

198
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,040
Oh, look here, baby.

199
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm all up on you.

200
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,900
Daisy Dukes.

201
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,600
Bikinis on top.

202
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,220
Sun-kissed skin so hot.

203
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,700
We'll melt your popsicle.

204
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,220
Oh, oh, oh.

205
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,980
California girls.

206
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,300
We're undeniable.

207
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,060
Fine, fresh, fierce.

208
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,960
We got it on lock.

209
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,880
West Coast represent.

210
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,800
Now put your hands.

211
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,400
There's

212
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,170
only a few children who would do what we do.

213
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,830
I think I lost.

214
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,670
I think I got lost in the sauce there a little bit.

215
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,970
I think I got lost in the sauce there a little bit.

216
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,510
No, I messed up the best part.

217
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,630
I'm so sorry.

218
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,780
One second.

219
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,360
I think I'm going to turn the glow down just a little bit.

220
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,180
So you guys don't keep getting flash banged when it shows up.

221
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,180
Oh my god.

222
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,760
That was California frogs.

223
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,760
Popsicle status melted.

224
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,020
California frogs.

225
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,920
My throat is...

226
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
My throat is...

227
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,360
My throat is...

228
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,920
Don't...

229
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,160
Don't tampon ready.

230
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,980
Like me and the frogs, right?

231
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,260
They gotta get frogs out.

232
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,560
Well, not in the summer time.

233
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,620
They... in the winter time.

234
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,400
Don't they hibernate?

235
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,520
Hmm.

236
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,360
Okay.

237
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,160
Thank you for karaoke on my birthday.

238
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,720
Happy birthday KCraft.

239
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,120
Ah.

240
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,520
Happy birthday to you.

241
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,300
Happy birthday to you.

242
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,100
Happy birthday to you.

243
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,940
Happy birthday KCraft.

244
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,920
Happy birthday to you.

245
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,180
Happy birthday...

246
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,540
to you...

247
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,400
Happy birthday...

248
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,300
Maybe cloudy and rainy out, butpois giglin '' taxes jasme '' singing is all the sunshine I need for What else can we do?

249
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh my gosh, the world is our oyster.

250
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,500
We can sing whatever we want.

251
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,720
Trooper by Iron Maiden.

252
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm sorry, I don't know it well enough.

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,160
Please don't spam though.

254
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,140
If you want me to sing a song, if you spam it, it's going to be even less likely I sing it.

255
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,660
Sorry, the notice.

256
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,980
This is the fat and ready content.

257
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,960
That's so funny.

258
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,360
Let's see.

259
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,420
The title of the stream is English song.

260
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,500
Kermit fat and ready.

261
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,720
Oh man.

262
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,420
Golden hour?

263
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,400
Already?

264
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,760
Oh my gosh, let me warm up a little bit first.

265
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,360
Let me warm up a little bit.

266
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
But I'm fat and ready for Frogbert to be my Yoshino.

267
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,280
Paramore.

268
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,260
Oh gosh, what do I know by Paramore?

269
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,120
I know maybe Paramore.

270
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,660
Yes, Golden Hour.

271
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,960
I could try.

272
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,040
Sing Snow Halation has about five English words.

273
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,380
Now I could sing the triple Q version.

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,940
Is it Misery Business is the one that I was...

275
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,620
I don't think I know it well enough though.

276
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,780
Do they have duvet?

277
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,860
Duvet?

278
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,920
Is that how you say it?

279
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,400
Oh my gosh, they do.

280
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay, I can sing that one later.

281
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
I want to do a little bit more.

282
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Mambo number five.

283
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,040
Mambo.

284
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,600
Mambo number five.

285
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,780
Ladies

286
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,520
and gentlemen, this is Mambo number five.

287
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,680
One, two, three, four, five.

288
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,260
Everybody in the car.

289
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,980
So come on, let's ride to the liquor store.

290
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,760
Let's go around the corner.

291
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,960
The boys say they want some gin and juice.

292
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,880
But I really don't want to be a buzz like I had last week.

293
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,540
I must stay deep because talk is cheap.

294
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,460
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra, and Rita.

295
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,200
And as I continue, you know they're getting sweeter.

296
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
So what can I do?

297
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,360
I don't know how this song is turning.

298
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,560
It's just like a spark.

299
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,980
Anything fly.

300
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,260
It's all good.

301
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,660
Let me jump in and send in the trumpet.

302
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,280
A little bit of Monica in my life.

303
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
A little bit of Erica.

304
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,920
On my side.

305
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,660
A little bit of Rita's all I need.

306
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,360
A little bit of Tina's what I see.

307
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,220
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

308
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,860
A little bit of Mary all I need.

309
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,080
But you makes me your man.

310
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,770
Jump up and down.

311
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,070
And move it all around.

312
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,510
Shake your head to the sound.

313
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,850
Put your hands on the ground.

314
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,630
Take one step left and one step right.

315
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,430
One to the front and one to the side.

316
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,510
Clap your hands.

317
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:54,830
One...

318
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,870
A little bit of Monica in my life.

319
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,330
A little bit of Erica.

320
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,340
A little bit of Rita's all I need.

321
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,040
A little bit of Tina's what I see.

322
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,940
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

323
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,540
A little bit of Minto.

324
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,260
It's an endurance stream, that's why.

325
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,160
You're mad!

326
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,460
Drop it!

327
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,720
A little bit of Rita's all I need.

328
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,440
A little bit of Tina's what I see.

329
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,280
A little bit of Sandra in the sun.

330
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,020
A little bit of Mary all night long.

331
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,780
A little bit of Jessica, here I am.

332
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,440
A little bit of you makes me your man.

333
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,780
To all to fall in love with a girl like you.

334
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,580
Cause you can't run and you can't hide.

335
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,220
You and me gonna touch the sky.

336
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,080
That's kind of scary.

337
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,700
What do you mean I can't run or hide?

338
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,940
I'm kind of scared now.

339
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,090
Yeah, Mambo, Mambo.

340
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,910
Number five.

341
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:55,850
Four.

342
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,310
This song is a threat.

343
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,550
Monica, Erica, Rita, Tina, Sandra, Mary, and Jessica?

344
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,270
All me.

345
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,470
Sing Jolene!

346
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,090
Oh my gosh.

347
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,810
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

348
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,390
I can try.

349
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,670
Dolly Parton.

350
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,320
I think I remember this one.

351
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,220
I think I...

352
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,340
Fleetwood Mac?

353
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh yeah, we can do some later.

354
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,500
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

355
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,070
Love you, please don't take my man.

356
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,350
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

357
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,690
Please don't take, take him just because you can.

358
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,190
Your beauty is beyond compare.

359
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,490
With flaming locks of auburn hair.

360
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,730
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green.

361
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,130
Your smile's like a breath of spring.

362
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,350
Your voice is soft like summer rain.

363
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,750
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene.

364
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,030
He talks about you in his sleep.

365
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,590
There's nothing I can do to keep from crying when he calls your name.

366
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,830
Jolene.

367
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,230
And I can easily understand how you could easily take my man.

368
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,510
But you don't know what he means to me.

369
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,030
Jolene.

370
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,650
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

371
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,230
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man.

372
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,250
Jolene.

373
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,350
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

374
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,090
Please don't take him just because you can.

375
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,850
You could have your choice of men, but I could never love again.

376
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,210
He's the only one for me.

377
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,530
Jolene.

378
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,610
Is that a JoJo reference?

379
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,030
Actually, the other way around.

380
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,590
My happiness depends on you and whatever you decide to do.

381
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,950
Jolene.

382
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,370
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

383
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,010
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man.

384
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,430
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

385
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,750
Please don't take him even though you can.

386
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,890
Jolene.

387
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,300
Jolene.

388
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,080
Damn, hit it, girl!

389
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,630
That's a Dolly Parton reference.

390
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,070
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.

391
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,070
Oops.

392
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,610
Jolene.

393
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,110
From JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

394
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,670
This too is Yuri.

395
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,710
I mean...

396
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,670
Jolene, she sounds like...

397
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,850
I don't know, I can't tell if she's like...

398
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,350
If she's gonna take the...

399
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,770
If she's like interested in the guy or if she's like, you know...

400
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:52,790
Moana!

401
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,410
I was just thinking I want to sing Disney songs.

402
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,070
Oh my god, I sang this all the time when I was in Japan.

403
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,190
I can't tell if she's like trying to take her...

404
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,870
Take the guy or if she's just like...

405
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,130
No, I know you can do it but like...

406
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,850
Please don't.

407
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,610
But also this guy sounds like a jerk.

408
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,030
He's the one who's like saying her name in his sleep.

409
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,330
What a weirdo.

410
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,010
What a weirdo.

411
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,350
Oh.

412
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,650
I don't remember which one it is.

413
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,110
If it's the original one or if it's the...

414
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,970
I'm gonna try this one.

415
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,190
If it's the wrong one, if it's like the...

416
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,910
If it's like the...

417
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,030
Poppy version, I'll change.

418
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,370
Break Stuff by Limp Bizkit.

419
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:41,910
Patience.

420
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,390
Patience.

421
00:25:52,160 --> 00:26:34,700
I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember Never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water No matter how hard I try Every turn I take Every trail I track Every path I make Every road leads back To the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows,

422
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:59,600
how far it goes, if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one day I'll know, if I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go, I know, everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island, everything is by design.

423
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:23,760
I know, everybody on this island, has a role on this island, so maybe I can roll with mine, I can lead with pride, I can make us strong, I'll be satisfied, if I play along, but the voice inside, sings a different song, what is wrong with me?

424
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:52,340
See the light as it shines on the sea, it's blinding, but no one knows, how deep it goes, and it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me, and let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line, see the line where the sky meets the sea,

425
00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:10,960
it calls me, and no one knows, how far it goes, if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one day I'll know, how far I'll go.

426
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,380
Wah.

427
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,080
Wah.

428
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,880
This song makes me tear up every time.

429
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,420
Wah.

430
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,220
Makes me so emotional.

431
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,380
How far I'll go.

432
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,800
Because I relate to the lyrics so much.

433
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,460
I don't know.

434
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,420
It's hard to explain.

435
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,800
Disney.

436
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,060
Disney, Disney.

437
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,940
What's another Disney, Disney?

438
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,240
I won't say I'm in love.

439
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,540
I don't know.

440
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,800
I won't say I'm in love.

441
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,360
Doo doo.

442
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Boo doo.

443
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,400
Boom, boom, boom.

444
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,400
Wait, there's a longer version of this song?

445
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,560
I don't know.

446
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:03,820
I don't know it though.

447
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:19,410
If there's a price for rotten judgement, I guess I've already won that.

448
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:26,070
No man is worth the aggravation, that's inked in history.

449
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,390
Been there, done that.

450
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,010
Who'd you think you're kidding?

451
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,090
He's the year that ever do you try to keep it hidden.

452
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,830
Honey, we can sing.

453
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,110
He's the year that ever do you try to keep it hidden.

454
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,810
We know how you feel.

455
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,690
Who do you think you know?

456
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,470
Oh, no chance.

457
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,470
No way.

458
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,550
I won't say it, no no.

459
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,370
Yes I.

460
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,430
Why don't I?

461
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,350
Oh oh.

462
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,010
It's too cliche.

463
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,850
I won't say I'm in love.

464
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,090
I thought my heart had learned its lesson.

465
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,810
It feels so good when you're in love.

466
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:36,130
Oh, no chance, no way, I won't say you don't know.

467
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,030
Give up, give in, check the grin, you're in love.

468
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,130
Your scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love.

469
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,610
You'll lay your face, I won't say it.

470
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,390
Get off my case, I won't say it.

471
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,590
Girl, don't be proud, it's okay.

472
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,360
Well, at least I'll love.

473
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,700
I won't say I'm in love.

474
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:11,760
I won't say I'm in love.

475
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,840
I should've had this, I should've, I should've...

476
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,740
I should've been like this the whole time.

477
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,000
Baby, don't, don't deny it.

478
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,860
We know how you're... how...

479
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,760
Oh my gosh, I saw someone else say something.

480
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,500
Actually, I'm just gonna do... a medley.

481
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,300
Maybe.

482
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,620
Say I'm in love.

483
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,980
Oh my gosh, you know what was so funny?

484
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,440
Before my stream yesterday with Ayami-sensei, when we were, when we were talking, um, we met about, uh...

485
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,660
Why are you...

486
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,060
You!

487
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,900
You're cute, aren't you?

488
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,020
Wow, thank you!

489
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,360
Thank you for singing for us tonight.

490
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,620
I hope you can sing some Disney songs tonight, but no...

491
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,140
Wow, virulent.

492
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,940
I think you're maybe...

493
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,340
Um, psychic.

494
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,780
Um...

495
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,660
What was I gonna say?

496
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,640
Um...

497
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,600
What was I gonna say?

498
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,960
Oh, when we were, like, talking to...

499
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,640
When we were talking with each other, I was like, I was still preparing, um, OBS.

500
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,180
And she was just like, It's okay, take your time.

501
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,560
And I was just like, she was just like, We can tell them that we'll be a little bit late.

502
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,380
And I was like, yeah, you know, Um, they'll just start crying.

503
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,060
And she was just like, yeah, haha.

504
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,320
And then...

505
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,660
When it got time to start the stream, And everybody started crying.

506
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,160
And then she was just like, Oh, it's time.

507
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,660
Should we...

508
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,680
Are you almost ready?

509
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,560
I was like, yeah, I'm almost ready.

510
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,620
Just maybe a few more minutes.

511
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,200
Um, are they crying?

512
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,220
And she was like, ah...

513
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,220
She looked and she's like, ah, it's true.

514
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,720
Ah, they really are.

515
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,880
They really are crying.

516
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,480
It was so funny.

517
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,100
Yeah.

518
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,460
Um...

519
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,740
We were talking about silly stuff.

520
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,040
Um...

521
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,360
Um, I won't be streaming for the next couple of days.

522
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:24,860
Um...

523
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,820
So...

524
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,780
I'll stream...

525
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,380
I don't know how long today's stream will be.

526
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
We'll stream until my voice gives out.

527
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,880
But I also need to get ready as well.

528
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,740
But we'll...

529
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,040
We'll...

530
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,640
We'll...

531
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,380
We'll...

532
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,840
We'll...

533
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,300
We'll sing until I cannot sing anymore.

534
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,360
So I'm gonna sing more Disney.

535
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,540
This song I've never sung before, but I really love this song.

536
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,380
So I think I'm gonna up the key.

537
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,540
Like a little...

538
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,140
Maybe 2.

539
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,980
And see how it goes.

540
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,710
Save behind these windows and these parapets of stone.

541
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,270
Gazing at the people down below me.

542
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,290
All of this live on some...

543
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,890
Hold on.

544
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,410
Before the history they show me.

545
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,950
That's kinda low.

546
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,550
Maybe I do need to lower the key.

547
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,570
Hold on, I'm going to lower the key.

548
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,930
I'll just try singing it normal.

549
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:30,190
All my life I've memorized their faces Knowing them as they will never know me After how it feels to pass the day Not above them But part of them And out there Living in the sun Give me one day out there All I ask is

550
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:55,730
A little pause... and

551
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,400
we are back.

552
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:54,520
Roofs and gables, I can see them Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives Heedless of the gift it is to be them If I was in their skin, I'd treasure Every instant out there Strolling by the sand Taste of morning out there Like ordinary men Who freely walk up out there Just one day and then I swear I'll be content With my share Won't resent,

553
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:07,460
won't despair Hold and bend, I won't care I'll have spent What I've got here out there

554
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,800
Oh.

555
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:28,110
God, I was not prepared for that.

556
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,070
Oh my.

557
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,670
I was not prepared.

558
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,870
Oh my God.

559
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,990
I'm sorry my voice cracked in that one part.

560
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,630
I'm so sorry my voice cracked.

561
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,150
I was not ready for that.

562
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,290
Oh my gosh, me being like, I don't want to sing some of the harder songs yet.

563
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,790
I need to warm my voice up first.

564
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:55,790
Sheesh.

565
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,010
Okay, this part.

566
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,950
This next song.

567
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,870
I'm going to skip the beginning.

568
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,890
I'm going to skip to here.

569
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,910
Speaking of hell, how about Hellfire?

570
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,310
I'm way ahead of you.

571
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,320
Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man.

572
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,020
Of my virtue I am justly proud.

573
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:44,300
Beata Maria, you know I'm so much purer than the common vulgar, weak, licentious crowd.

574
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,560
Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?

575
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,440
Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul?

576
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,980
I feel her.

577
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,280
I see her.

578
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,980
The sun caught in her raven hair is blazing in me out of all control.

579
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:17,960
Like fire, hellfire, this fire in my soul.

580
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:28,340
This burning desire is turning me to sin.

581
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,340
It's not my fault.

582
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,020
I'm not to blame.

583
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,860
It is the gypsy girl, the witch who sent this flame.

584
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,020
It's not my fault.

585
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:46,480
If in God's plan, he made the devil so much stronger than a man.

586
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,380
Protect me, Maria.

587
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,940
Don't let this siren cast her spell.

588
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,720
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone.

589
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,820
Destroy Esmeralda.

590
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,800
And let her taste the fires of hell.

591
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,360
Or else let her be mine and mine alone.

592
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
Minister Frollo.

593
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,980
The gypsy has escaped.

594
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,340
Who are you?

595
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,680
Get out of my room.

596
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,320
She's no one in the cathedral.

597
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,060
No, what?

598
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,400
She's gone.

599
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:18,980
Oh, my God.

600
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:19,940
But how?

601
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,300
Um, go get my girlfriend back.

602
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,040
Uh, I'll find her if I have to burn down all of Paris.

603
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,700
Hellfire, dark fire.

604
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,940
Now, gypsy, it's your turn.

605
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,900
Choose me or your pyre.

606
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,400
Be mine or you will burn.

607
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,240
God have mercy on her.

608
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,840
God have mercy on me.

609
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:09,580
But she will be mine or she will burn.

610
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,270
escaped.

611
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,810
That song fills me with so much passion.

612
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:31,870
You know what, that's a go out there and get her guy kind of song, isn't it?

613
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,950
Ha ha ha ha.

614
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,190
Go out there!

615
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,870
That's a go get her song.

616
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,180
That's a... Yeah.

617
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,620
No it's not.

618
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,410
Oh, my gosh.

619
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,310
Villain songs are always so good, right?

620
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,130
Reccept?

621
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,970
Oh my gosh, I really dislike the one from Wish.

622
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,110
I don't remember how it even goes.

623
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,610
Actually, okay, you guys, give me a second.

624
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,970
You know that I recently got a standing desk?

625
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,630
And I believe I should stand this stream.

626
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,750
I hope when I use this, it doesn't turn off my computer.

627
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,790
I'm like worried that it's gonna like short circuit.

628
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,950
I'm gonna stand.

629
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,850
Oh, okay.

630
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,990
I'm lifting up my desk.

631
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,350
I'm lifting up my desk.

632
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,330
Oh, how high can this go?

633
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:25,550
Wow.

634
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,410
Okay.

635
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,710
Nice.

636
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,950
Standing time.

637
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,650
Oh my gosh, I have so much room to dance around.

638
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,150
Oh no, I'm gonna be so much more obnoxious now cause I'm gonna be...

639
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,330
actually like dancing around.

640
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,470
Gonna be dancing around for real.

641
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,670
Give me one second.

642
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,770
What is going on here?

643
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:55,610
There we go.

644
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,730
Make sure my phone's not on.

645
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,470
Okay.

646
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,910
Okay.

647
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,810
What's the next song?

648
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,510
Actually, you know, can I do one more?

649
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,230
Hunchback of Notre Dame's song.

650
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,270
Are Hololive songs off limits for legal reasons?

651
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,090
No, but...

652
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,790
Hold on, I'm also gonna move my mic up.

653
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:19,470
Oh, setlist.

654
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,810
Thank you.

655
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,190
Out there.

656
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,790
And Hellfire.

657
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,230
Boy, it's one word.

658
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,030
But a lot of the Hololive songs are in Japanese.

659
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,890
And this is...

660
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,570
This is in English.

661
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,410
This is in English.

662
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,950
Oh, Sparks?

663
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:42,890
Wait.

664
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,730
Is there even a karaoke for Sparks?

665
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,100
Sparks Instrumental.

666
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,810
I'm not gonna bother Kiyo.

667
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:54,030
Kiara.

668
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,110
Wait.

669
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,630
Kiara.

670
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,470
Oh my god!

671
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:00,230
Wait.

672
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,670
There is one.

673
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,350
Wait.

674
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,450
It says karaoke instrumental with lyrics.

675
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,640
Do you might be the...

676
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,220
Do you?

677
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:14,820
Do you?

678
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,320
I don't know if I could sing them well, but I'll try.

679
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,140
Maybe later.

680
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,580
Oh my gosh.

681
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,600
Okay.

682
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,160
One more Hunchback of Notre Dame song.

683
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:28,620
I'm sorry.

684
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:28,960
Wait.

685
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,340
Is it this one?

686
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,000
I'll do the shorter one.

687
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,920
I think it's the shorter one.

688
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,740
Danielle, welcome to membership.

689
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,500
And thank you guys for all the super chats too.

690
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,340
I'll make a man out of you.

691
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:39,880
Yes.

692
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,340
I'll do I'll make a man out of you.

693
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:45,840
No worries.

694
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,340
I'll do more Disney.

695
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:49,820
Sorry.

696
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,600
I'm a Disney fan.

697
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,340
I don't want to say the Disney adult.

698
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,360
That's embarrassing right?

699
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,060
I don't know if you can hear me.

700
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,180
Or if you're even there.

701
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,820
I don't know if you will listen.

702
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,140
To a humble prayer.

703
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,980
Tell me I'm just an outcast.

704
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,920
I shouldn't speak to you.

705
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,860
Still I see your face and wonder.

706
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,980
Were you once an outcast?

707
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:44,680
God help the outcasts, hungry from work, show them the mercy they don't find on earth.

708
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:51,460
The lost and forgotten, they look to you still.

709
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:58,540
God help the outcasts, or nobody will.

710
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,420
Why does this sound like the ending version?

711
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,820
It sounds different.

712
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,740
I ask for nothing, I can get by.

713
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:17,680
But I know so many less lucky than I.

714
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,840
God help the outcasts, the poor and down-drawn.

715
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:31,960
I thought we all were the children of God.

716
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,460
Listen, some are, and some are not.

717
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,120
Why the few you seem to favor.

718
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,840
The

719
00:46:51,470 --> 00:47:01,420
outcasts, the tattered, the torn.

720
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:08,660
Seeking an answer to why they were born.

721
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,400
Winds of misfortune have blown them about.

722
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,580
You made the outcasts, don't cast them out.

723
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,960
I'm confused.

724
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,500
The poor and unlucky, the weak and the odd.

725
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,240
That's me.

726
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:40,300
I thought we all were the children of God.

727
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,730
I'm sorry, I'm so unserious.

728
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,710
I'm the odd.

729
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,260
Okay, I'm not even gonna put that on the set list.

730
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,120
I was so confused.

731
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,600
During that.

732
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,960
I thought I picked the shorter version because there's also a longer version.

733
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,820
But I don't remember the other parts of this.

734
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:10,220
Okay.

735
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,400
I love Hunchback of Notre Dame.

736
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,120
It's such an awesome movie.

737
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,860
There's a karaoke of the original version out there.

738
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,120
I'm sure there is, but...

739
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,400
Let's see.

740
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,060
Do you still remember the requests?

741
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,200
There were a ton.

742
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:29,680
What do you mean?

743
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,180
Remember?

744
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,320
There were so many requests.

745
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,100
Tarzan songs?

746
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,160
I don't know very many Tarzan songs because I didn't watch a lot of Tarzan.

747
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,960
Kendrick?

748
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,640
Kendrick Lamar song?

749
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't even know that guy.

750
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,060
Has been hotel?

751
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,120
Those songs have bad words in it.

752
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,260
Has been hotel.

753
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,700
There's only actually one song from Has been hotel that I've listened to.

754
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,820
And it's...

755
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,040
I don't know.

756
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,580
I don't remember what it was called.

757
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,620
Stayed gone?

758
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:03,700
Maybe...

759
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:03,820
No.

760
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,000
There's a song between...

761
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,240
I don't know.

762
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,000
I've never watched it.

763
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:11,320
It's a song between the radio guy and the TV guy.

764
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:15,960
Kevin Lamar?

765
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,340
Oh.

766
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,060
Who's that?

767
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,140
Who's that?

768
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:21,400
Wait.

769
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,080
Who's that?

770
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,220
Stayed gone?

771
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:27,740
I was...

772
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,180
I was right?

773
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,260
Oh my god.

774
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:30,940
I'm scared though.

775
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm showing the screen and if it says bad word, it's gonna show up.

776
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,180
Fulamukul Rivals.

777
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,520
That's the guy.

778
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,340
Who's Ken then?

779
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,180
Kevin

780
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,070
Lamar is what Fulamukul call...

781
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:54,370
Wait.

782
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,850
So his name is actually Kev...

783
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:56,230
Kevin.

784
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,090
His actual name is Kendrick.

785
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:13,830
Oh.

786
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:14,110
Oh.

787
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:16,950
Oh.

788
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,070
I see.

789
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:24,570
I always...

790
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,670
I always thought they were two different people because they were talking.

791
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:27,730
I've only seen...

792
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,030
I've seen Kendrick Lamar and I've seen Kevin Lamar.

793
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,730
I thought they were two different people.

794
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,630
I was like...

795
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:33,770
Wow.

796
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,730
There's a lot of rappers with the last name Lamar.

797
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,070
Wow.

798
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,130
I was like...

799
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,270
Wow.

800
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,690
I didn't realize Lamar was such a popular last name.

801
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:47,490
I

802
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,260
was like...

803
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,440
Is this a bit?

804
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,320
I'm never serious.

805
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,120
What are you talking about?

806
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,060
Of course this is a bit.

807
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,040
Thanks for the peek!

808
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,940
Your unique voice and personality elevates every song you sing.

809
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,940
Sing your heart out.

810
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,500
Thank you!

811
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,860
Thank you, thank you!

812
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,340
Lamar isn't his last name?

813
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,100
What?

814
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,060
What does it mean?

815
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,260
Is it like a...

816
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,060
type of juice?

817
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,090
Please wrap it up.

818
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:31,710
Shut up!

819
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,970
Oh, it's a middle name!

820
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,540
His last name is actually Duxworth.

821
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,400
No, it's not.

822
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,600
Kevin Lamar Duxworth.

823
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,020
Duxworth is a song by...

824
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,940
Oh, no!

825
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,880
Kendrick Lamar!

826
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,720
It is!

827
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:04,860
It's real!

828
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,920
It's...

829
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,100
It's actually his last name!

830
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:12,900
Hold on.

831
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,380
A song by Kendrick Lamar...

832
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,900
Taken from his album...

833
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,300
Damn!

834
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,220
The song title is Lamar's actual last name.

835
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,520
What?

836
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,860
What?

837
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,140
Who is Kendrick Lamar?

838
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,040
Oh!

839
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,180
He's just some guy.

840
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,740
I would also go...

841
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,600
No, he should have gone by Duxworth.

842
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,560
That's so much cooler.

843
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,620
That's so much cooler.

844
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,950
What do you mean, some guy?

845
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:55,910
I don't know.

846
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,970
I'm just looking at him.

847
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,170
He just looks like a guy.

848
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,710
Am I looking at the right person?

849
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:03,150
Am I looking at the right person?

850
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:03,790
Oh, wait.

851
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:04,050
Sorry.

852
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:04,650
I typed Kevin.

853
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,130
Kendrick Lamar.

854
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,650
Actually, I'm going to look up Kevin Duxworth.

855
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,970
Actually, I'm going to look up Kevin Duxworth.

856
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,960
That's just...

857
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,080
Yeah.

858
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,520
Okay.

859
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,160
It would be kind of weird if he looked like a ghost.

860
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:25,480
It would be kind of weird if he looked like a ghost.

861
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,260
I'm not expecting him to look like a ghost.

862
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,080
I'm just... I don't know.

863
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,240
I don't know what I'm expecting.

864
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:30,340
I'm expecting.

865
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,180
It's my birthday!

866
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,320
Happy birthday, Marty!

867
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,220
Happy birthday!

868
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,200
Was it my first Super Award?

869
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,120
Thank you!

870
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,100
Yeah, I kind of expected a duck.

871
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,720
To be honest.

872
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,640
Happy birthday to you.

873
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,600
Happy birthday to you.

874
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,860
Happy birthday to you.

875
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,640
Happy birthday dear Marty.

876
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,920
Happy birthday dear Marty.

877
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,220
Happy birthday dear Marty.

878
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,620
Happy birthday!

879
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,640
To be you!

880
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,300
Happy birthday to...

881
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:07,600
to you.

882
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,430
His dad's nickname was actually Ducky.

883
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:19,340
I wonder if this is on here.

884
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,580
Oh my gosh!

885
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,960
Life

886
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:38,330
is like a hurricane here in Duckburg.

887
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,470
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes.

888
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,810
It's a duck blur.

889
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:49,150
Might solve a mystery or rewrite history.

890
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:50,710
DuckTales!

891
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:56,190
Every day they're out there making DuckTales.

892
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:56,850
When

893
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,680
it seems they're heading for the final curtain.

894
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,020
Cool deduction never fails.

895
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,200
That's for certain.

896
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,400
The worst of messes become successes.

897
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,440
DuckTales!

898
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:31,880
Every day they're out there making DuckTales.

899
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,180
There's a stranger out to find you.

900
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,180
What to do?

901
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,900
Just grab on to some DuckTales!

902
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,420
Oh

903
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,870
my god.

904
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:26,930
Yay!

905
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,480
Thank you for singing the song of my people.

906
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,200
I got you.

907
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,600
DuckTales!

908
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:35,940
Woo!

909
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,220
I was jumping all around the whole song.

910
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,200
Oh wait, did I do anything between Hellfire and...

911
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,700
Yeah, DuckTales.

912
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,240
DuckTales!

913
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,640
Woo!

914
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:57,900
Basically like doing jumping jacks.

915
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,140
Cause I'm like flapping my hands.

916
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,150
Okay.

917
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,690
That was so fun yo.

918
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,830
I'll one day sing it.

919
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,070
Maybe with 3D.

920
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:19,130
It's my birthday too which means this karaoke is specifically for me now since I am announcing it after the other guy.

921
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:19,910
Teemo!

922
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,050
Happy birthday!

923
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,650
Happy birthday to you.

924
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,990
Happy birthday to you.

925
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,350
Happy birthday dear Teemo.

926
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:37,510
Happy birthday to you.

927
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,420
How about some Little Mermaid for your newest subscriber?

928
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,900
Second newest now.

929
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,220
Little Mermaid I can do.

930
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,840
Little Mermaid.

931
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,100
Which song from the Little Mermaid?

932
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,640
What song should I do from the Little Mermaid?

933
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,860
I can do all of them.

934
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,480
No, I'm just kidding.

935
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,820
Under the sea.

936
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,920
Under the sea.

937
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,060
Okay.

938
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,360
I'm gonna start dancing again.

939
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,900
You guys just want me to dance.

940
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,920
The seaweed is always greener.

941
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,040
In somebody else's lake.

942
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,400
Can I show you guys?

943
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,560
Can I show you how I feel when I'm singing these?

944
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,220
Hold on.

945
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,060
I have to get...

946
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,680
I have to get a TikTok that I sent to Matara.

947
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:47,800
But...

948
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,860
But it's actually maybe me.

949
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,860
I sent it to her and I was like, this is you.

950
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,200
But maybe it's me.

951
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,100
Okay, hold on, hold on.

952
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,200
Where is it?

953
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,660
I said this is you.

954
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,800
I'm gonna put it on the screen and then you can just imagine me looking like this while I'm singing.

955
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,060
Okay, okay.

956
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:11,920
But hold on.

957
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,360
I have to make sure you don't hear the audio.

958
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,840
Can I just...

959
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,820
Oh, download video.

960
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,380
Oh my god!

961
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,220
I can just download the video!

962
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,080
Oh wait.

963
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,620
It's gonna play the audio though.

964
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,840
I don't want you to hear the audio.

965
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:27,520
I don't want you to hear the audio.

966
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:27,940
Uh...

967
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,280
Let's see.

968
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,880
How do I do this?

969
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,260
Maybe like this.

970
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,400
And then...

971
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,960
How do I do this?

972
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,940
I should turn the air on in my...

973
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,460
In my maid cafe.

974
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,340
It's so warm.

975
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,420
Mute it?

976
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,200
It's gonna play immediately.

977
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,140
I'm scared.

978
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,540
Oh, wait.

979
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:54,900
Yeah.

980
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:55,800
Oh, shoot.

981
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,400
How do I do this?

982
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,040
Sorry.

983
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,220
Sorry for...

984
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:06,840
Uh...

985
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,680
Uh...

986
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,790
Let me have the stream for a minute.

987
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:19,770
No, it's because...

988
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,990
No, it's because...

989
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,850
OBS is kinda messing me up right now.

990
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:25,010
OBS is kinda messing me up right now.

991
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,250
Okay, hold on.

992
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,050
I got this.

993
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:27,490
Okay, okay.

994
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:30,110
Okay.

995
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:30,710
Kind of.

996
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:30,910
Maybe.

997
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:34,810
No, I just wanna show you guys the silly video!

998
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,950
Oh, I just wanna show you the silly video!

999
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,530
Oh, I just wanna show you the silly video!

1000
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,530
Just wanna show you silly video.

1001
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:42,950
Just wanna show you silly video.

1002
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,810
Maybe audio filter.

1003
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,550
Okay, hold on.

1004
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,830
Maybe I can do gain.

1005
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,070
And then lower entirely.

1006
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,590
So that there's nothing that plays.

1007
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:52,970
Okay.

1008
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,170
I'm really sorry if you hear this.

1009
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,990
I'm really sorry!

1010
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,470
Okay, okay.

1011
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,030
I'm just gonna put it right here.

1012
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,990
Okay, this is me.

1013
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,350
This is me as I'm...

1014
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,490
As I'm singing.

1015
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,790
If you were trying to imagine music, If you were trying to imagine music, it's caramel dancing.

1016
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:18,250
It's caramel dancing.

1017
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:49,620
The seaweed is always greener Than somebody else's lake You dream about going up there You dream about going up there But that is a big mistake Just look at the world around you Right here on the ocean floor Such wonderful things around you What more is here looking for?

1018
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,440
Under the sea!

1019
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,860
Under the sea!

1020
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,660
Darling, it's better down where it's wetter Take it from me!

1021
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:08,360
Up on the shore They work all day Out in the sun, they survive a wave While we double in full time To float in under the sea

1022
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:32,200
Down here all the fish is happy As all through the waves they roll The fish on the land ain't happy They sat cosily in their pool But fish in the bowl is lucky But fish in the bowl is lucky They aim for a worse fate One day when the boss gets hungry Guess who's gonna be on the plate Uh oh!

1023
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,520
Under the sea!

1024
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,920
Under the sea!

1025
01:03:37,040 --> 01:04:09,840
Nobody feed us fries And eat us and make us What would we learn To fully cook Under the sea we're off the hook We got no troubles Life is the bowels Under the sea, under the sea Under the sea, under the sea We hear, we got the beat here Naturally Even the surgeon and the ray They get the urge and start to play We got the spirit You got to hear it Under the sea The flute,

1026
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:20,880
the carp play the harp The place play the bass And they sound and sharp The bass play the brass And trill play the tub The fluke is the duke of soul The ray he can play The lings on the strings

1027
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,720
Oh where is that?

1028
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,400
And oh that blowfish Maybe

1029
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:46,530
a standing desk was a mistake

1030
01:04:53,590 --> 01:05:04,690
Under the sea Under the sea When the sardine begins The big greenie's music to me What do they got?

1031
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:29,150
A lot of sand We got a hot Cressacean fan Each little clam here Know how to jump here Under the sea Each little slug here Caught in a rut here Under the sea Each little snail here Know how to wail here That's why it's hotter Under the water Yeah we in luck here Down in the muck here Under the sea Yeah

1032
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:43,610
That's me That was me the entire song That little kid Including the falling on the floor And everything Yay

1033
01:05:51,390 --> 01:06:01,170
Be my guest Be Be our guest Got me groovin' and laughin' at work, didn't you know that?

1034
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:04,990
This one.

1035
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,490
Be our guest, be our guest.

1036
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,910
Les poissons.

1037
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:13,790
Les poissons, les poissons.

1038
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:14,730
Something, something.

1039
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:15,450
Les poissons.

1040
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,930
Ma chérie, mademoiselle.

1041
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:23,650
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.

1042
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,230
And now we invite you to relax.

1043
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:27,030
Let's relax.

1044
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:32,670
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents your dinner.

1045
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:41,590
Be our guest, be our guest, put our service to the test.

1046
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:46,350
Tie your napkin round your neck, chérie, and we'll provide the rest.

1047
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:51,230
Soup de jour, hors de devour, we only live to serve.

1048
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,190
Try the great stuff, it's delicious.

1049
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:54,450
Don't believe me?

1050
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,570
Ask the dishes.

1051
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:56,750
They can sing.

1052
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,050
They can dance.

1053
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:00,010
After all, Miss, this is France.

1054
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:03,590
And a dinner here is never second best.

1055
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,410
Go on, unfold your men.

1056
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:10,090
You take a glance, and then you'll be our guest.

1057
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,170
We our guest.

1058
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,290
Be our guest.

1059
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,550
Be our good cheese to play.

1060
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,710
Pie and pudding en flambé.

1061
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:21,710
We'll prepare and serve with flair a culinary cabaret.

1062
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:26,070
You're alone and you're scared, but the banquet's all prepared.

1063
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:26,730
No, no, no, no, no.

1064
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:30,330
No one's gloomy or complaining while the flatware's entertaining.

1065
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,710
We tell jokes.

1066
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:32,770
I do tricks.

1067
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,990
With my fellow candlesticks.

1068
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:38,050
And it's all in perfect taste that you can bear.

1069
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:41,030
Come on and list your glass.

1070
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,010
You've won your bone-free pass.

1071
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,390
To be our guest.

1072
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,190
If you're stressed, it's fine.

1073
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,390
Dining, we suggest.

1074
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:48,830
Be our guest.

1075
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:49,950
Be our guest.

1076
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,410
Be our guest.

1077
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,710
Life is so unnerving.

1078
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,710
For certain, you're only human.

1079
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,470
It's just like me, I'm a maid.

1080
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:06,430
Ah, the good old days when we were useful.

1081
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,030
I don't remember this part.

1082
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,310
Suddenly, those good old days are gone.

1083
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:17,630
Ten years we've been rusting, needing so much more than dusting.

1084
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,770
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills.

1085
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:26,050
Most days, we just lay around ze castle.

1086
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:31,090
Flabby, fat, and lazy, you walked in and oops-a-daisy.

1087
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:34,990
It's a guest, it's a guest, sakes alive, I'll be blessed.

1088
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:38,770
Wine's been poured, and thank the Lord, I had the napkins freshly pressed.

1089
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:42,550
With dessert, she'll want tea, and my dear, that's fine with me.

1090
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:47,130
While the cups do their soft-shoe-in, I'll be blubbing, I'll be blub-blub-blubbing.

1091
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,110
Heaven's sake, is that a spot?

1092
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:53,130
Clean it up, we want the company impressed.

1093
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:57,810
We've got a lot to do, is it one lump or two?

1094
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:02,110
For you our guest, be our guest, she's our guest, be our guest.

1095
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,630
Be our guest, be our guest, a command is your request.

1096
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:09,310
It's been years since we've had anybody here, and we're obsessed.

1097
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,210
With your meal, with your ease, yes indeed, we aim to please.

1098
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:17,890
While the candlelight's still glowing, let us help you.

1099
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,710
We'll keep going.

1100
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:25,130
Worst by course, oh!

1101
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:27,170
One by one, oh!

1102
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,070
Till you shout, enough, I'm done!

1103
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:33,250
Then we'll sing you off to sleep you as they're jealous.

1104
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:38,010
Tonight you'll prop your feet up, but for now let's eat up.

1105
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:43,270
Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest, please.

1106
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,870
Be our guest!

1107
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,550
Why are you making me sing all these heart songs?

1108
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:00,670
Why are

1109
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,200
you making me sing all these heart songs?

1110
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,140
Oh wait, uh, I've missed, uh, Under the Sea.

1111
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:10,860
And...

1112
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:15,780
Be our guest, be our guest, ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba.

1113
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,660
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

1114
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:25,440
Oh my god, it's the whole time I was just thinking of the, of the ride at Tokyo Disney, so awesome.

1115
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,040
Must be getting a workout tonight.

1116
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:27,540
I am!

1117
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,160
Take a break by singing tequila?

1118
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,320
You're so right.

1119
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,660
What does tequila taste like?

1120
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,700
I've never had it before.

1121
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,720
Rockbiter, thanks for the vibe!

1122
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,280
Gifted!

1123
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:39,660
Thank you.

1124
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,440
Thank you so much!

1125
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,000
Is it this one?

1126
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,770
It's spicy?

1127
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,700
Oh no!

1128
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,440
I'm getting an itch in my body!

1129
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,360
I'm getting an itch in my body!

1130
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,580
I'm dancing!

1131
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:02,840
Oh no!

1132
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:57,720
Tequila!

1133
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,200
Who are you?

1134
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,740
Careful not to strain your voice.

1135
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,060
Yay.

1136
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,180
Okay.

1137
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,160
I'm all warmed up now.

1138
01:13:51,340 --> 01:14:04,380
It was two lovers Sitting in the car, listening to Blonde Falling for each other Pink and orange skies, feeling super childish No Donald Glover Missed call from my mother Like where you at tonight?

1139
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:23,100
Got no alibi I was all alone with the love Of my life She's got glitter for skin My radiant beam In the night Look down I don't need no light To see you Shine

1140
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,880
It's your Golden hour

1141
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:43,220
You slow down time In your

1142
01:14:49,080 --> 01:15:11,340
We were just two lovers feet up on the dash driving nowhere fast burning through the summer radio on blast make the moment last she got solar power and it's feel like hours she knew she was the baddest can you even imagine falling like i did And for the love of my life,

1143
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:20,380
she's got glow on her face, a glorious look in her eyes, my angel of light.

1144
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:31,920
I was all alone with the love of my life, she's got glitter for skin, my radiant beam in the night.

1145
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:39,280
I don't need no light to see you shine.

1146
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,300
It's your golden time.

1147
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,560
You slow down time.

1148
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:01,570
In your golden time.

1149
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,320
I forget how long the intro or the outro is.

1150
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,060
I saw someone else request something earlier.

1151
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,380
That I can sing.

1152
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,720
Actually, I will do my best.

1153
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,960
I will do my best to sing.

1154
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,000
I think I've only sung this song once.

1155
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,520
Hate to give you satisfaction, asking how you're doing now.

1156
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,780
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?

1157
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:40,100
Just like you wanted.

1158
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,240
Look at you, cool guy.

1159
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,940
You got it.

1160
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:49,820
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes.

1161
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,760
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise.

1162
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,340
I loved you truly.

1163
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,060
You gotta laugh at the stupidity.

1164
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,780
Cause I've made some real big mistakes.

1165
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,560
But you make the worst one look fine.

1166
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,020
I should have known it was strange.

1167
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:12,700
You only come out at night.

1168
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,160
I used to think I was smart.

1169
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,720
But you made me look so naive.

1170
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:23,600
The way you sold me for parts.

1171
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,800
Cause you sunk your teeth into me.

1172
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,940
You're a bloodsucker.

1173
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,020
Fame fucker.

1174
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,160
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn bam.

1175
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:43,070
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news.

1176
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:44,050
You called them crazy.

1177
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:46,510
God, I hate the way I called them crazy too.

1178
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:47,410
You're so convincing.

1179
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,970
How do you lie without flinching?

1180
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,890
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill.

1181
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,010
Can't figure out just how you do it.

1182
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,570
God knows I will never will.

1183
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:01,870
Not for her.

1184
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,650
Cause girls your age know better.

1185
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:08,630
I've made some real big mistakes.

1186
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:12,310
But you make the worst ones look fine.

1187
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,750
I should have known it was strange.

1188
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:19,390
You only come out at night.

1189
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:22,650
I used to think I was smart.

1190
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:26,070
But you made me look so naive.

1191
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:29,870
The way you sold me for parts.

1192
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:33,050
Cause you sunk your teeth into me.

1193
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:36,110
You're a bloodsucker.

1194
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:38,170
Fame fucker.

1195
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:41,490
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire.

1196
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,540
You said it was true love.

1197
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,300
But wouldn't that be hard?

1198
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,620
You can't love anyone.

1199
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,660
Cause that would mean you had a heart.

1200
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:57,340
I tried to help you out.

1201
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,900
Now I know that I can.

1202
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,720
Cause now you think this kind of things I'll never understand.

1203
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,080
I've made some real big mistakes.

1204
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,740
But you make the worst ones look fine.

1205
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,160
I should have known it was strange.

1206
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,680
You only come out at night.

1207
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,980
I used to think I was smart.

1208
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,380
But you made me look so naive.

1209
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,180
The way you sold me for parts.

1210
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,320
Cause you sunk your teeth into me.

1211
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,420
You're a bloodsucker.

1212
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,480
Fame fucker.

1213
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:43,880
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire.

1214
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,100
Yeah!

1215
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,140
This is Vampire by Olivia Rodrigo.

1216
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,680
Wait, what did I sing after Tequila?

1217
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:04,960
Oh, Golden Hour?

1218
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,440
And then...

1219
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:08,660
Vampire?

1220
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,100
English?

1221
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:12,980
Olivia?

1222
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,060
Not to be mistaken with the other?

1223
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,600
Glad you're back, Min!

1224
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,940
Since you're not streaming on Friday.

1225
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,040
Could I get an early happy birthday?

1226
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,640
Of course, table gnome!

1227
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:29,260
Happy birthday to you.

1228
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,660
Happy birthday to you.

1229
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,580
Happy birthday dear table gnome.

1230
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:42,100
Happy birthday to you.

1231
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,000
Happy birthday!

1232
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:46,800
Happy early birthday.

1233
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,820
Sorry, I won't be here to celebrate on the actual day.

1234
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:49,860
But just play this on the actual day.

1235
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:50,840
Actually, don't even listen right now.

1236
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,300
Play it back on the original...

1237
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,160
On the actual day.

1238
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,740
The original day.

1239
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,880
There's actually a song I want to sing.

1240
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,940
I've never sung it before.

1241
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,200
Okay.

1242
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:00,980
Oh wait!

1243
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,100
Actually, there's a couple songs I wrote down.

1244
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,600
I remember someone saying this earlier.

1245
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,380
I've never sung this song before, so I'm kind of nervous.

1246
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,080
I'll do my best.

1247
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:12,900
Oh.

1248
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:13,980
Oh.

1249
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,240
Oh.

1250
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,520
Oh.

1251
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,080
Oh.

1252
01:22:51,080 --> 01:23:29,940
I have lost it all And you don't seem the lying kind A shame that I can read your mind And all the things I bet I read there Candlelit smile that we both share And you know I don't mean to hurt you But you know that it means so much And you don't even feel the pain I am falling,

1253
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:47,660
I am fading I am drowning, help me to breathe I am hurting, I have lost it all I am losing, help me to breathe

1254
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:28,840
I am falling, I am failing, help me to breathe I don't know the ad-libs here.

1255
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,380
I am falling, I am failing,

1256
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:54,940
help me to breathe I am hurting, I am drowning, help me to breathe I have lost it all, I am losing, help me to breathe I have lost

1257
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:30,850
it all, I am losing, help me to breathe

1258
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:41,450
How do you say the name of this song?

1259
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,190
Duvet?

1260
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,250
I know it's French probably, right?

1261
01:25:44,810 --> 01:26:09,730
Duvet It's so crazy how this song kind of blew up recently But as I guess most maybe not maybe not most people nowadays but It's the opening of the anime Serial Experiments LANE Which I watched long long long ago Long long long ago Duvet like the blanket,

1262
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:18,770
I don't know actually Maybe Let's all love LANE It's because of LANE

1263
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:43,850
LANE LANE Serial Experiments LANE Now, okay Would love to hear you sing My First Lover by Gillian Welch The movie The Strangers got me into this song Oh, the one that creepy song that like plays over and over again on the...

1264
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,330
Can we try Welcome to the Black Parade?

1265
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:46,450
Let's do that later

1266
01:26:50,510 --> 01:27:05,190
Thank you Oh my gosh also Brick, I'm so sorry I just saw your Akadono Mint left heaven but she still sings like an angel No, thank you Thank you so much I'm sorry I missed it Arigato, arigato, chu

1267
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,490
What was I gonna say?

1268
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,930
Way to Fall, I could do Way to Fall No, I was gonna say something though Um...

1269
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:43,350
Mariana Cross, I could do that one too Maybe my voice can handle it I don't remember, sorry My whole brain Chapleroad H-O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me Hot to go Hot Minto!

1270
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:58,830
H-O-T-T-O-G-O Wait, H-O-T-M-I-N-T-O You can take me Hot Minto!

1271
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:12,430
I wonder if there's any Final Fantasy on here Final Fantasy I sung some a while ago before Oh my god!

1272
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:13,430
They have Stekidane!

1273
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,870
But this song is in Jap- Wait, is it in Japanese?

1274
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:22,430
I'm so curious I'm so curious right now I don't think I've ever sung a Japanese song on Cairofun So I'm like...

1275
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:28,170
There's- There's not an English version of this song, is there?

1276
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,280
I think

1277
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:49,260
there's a- I'm gonna skip forward, I hope it's okay Actually, no This could be one Japanese song

1278
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,620
Don't think twice This song is so hard I wonder if there's Utada Hikaru on here

1279
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:06,380
Oh wait, I'm thinking of Chikai Chikai is really hard But don't think twice I could maybe do if it's on here Oh my god

1280
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:46,970
Kase ga koshita kotoba ni Oyoida Kokoro Kumou ga hakobu ashita ni Kazunda koe I can't get the timing Tsuki ga yureru kagami ni Furuetta

1281
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,400
A little pause... and we are back.

1282
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:40,600
A little pause... and we are back.

1283
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,660
A little pause... and we are back.

1284
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:54,720
This

1285
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,660
part is so pretty!

1286
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,640
3,

1287
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:40,340
2, 1

1288
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,300
遠くこの声 A voice, so far away

1289
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,820
月が滲む鏡を 流れた The moon flows through the mirror that blurs

1290
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,120
星が揺れてこぼれた The stars sway and fall

1291
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,860
隠せない涙 I can't hide these tears Cobo Mansion.

1292
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,800
I like this part.

1293
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:58,790
Oh my god!

1294
01:33:59,170 --> 01:33:59,650
Yay!

1295
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,570
I could see it!

1296
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:02,810
Oh my god, at the beginning I was like trying to...

1297
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:04,390
I couldn't remember so much of it.

1298
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:07,330
But then it all came back to me all at once.

1299
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:11,590
I love Final Fantasy X and X-2.

1300
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:14,790
They do have Utada Hikaru on here.

1301
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:19,630
No,

1302
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:25,290
they don't have...

1303
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,690
What was Chikai called again?

1304
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,130
Um...

1305
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:32,130
They don't have it though.

1306
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:33,570
No!

1307
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:36,210
They do have Simple and Clean though.

1308
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:41,270
Thousand Words.

1309
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:43,370
I don't know if they had it though.

1310
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:46,250
Final Fantasy X-2 songs.

1311
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:47,690
Let me see if they have a Thousand Words.

1312
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:54,180
No.

1313
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:56,340
Sad.

1314
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,700
Do they have...

1315
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,460
What was the other one?

1316
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,580
What can I do for you?

1317
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,020
Melodies of Life.

1318
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:08,080
No.

1319
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,260
I think that was the only Final Fantasy song that they have.

1320
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,100
So sad.

1321
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,020
So sad.

1322
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:17,760
Wait, I wonder if I put in Kingdom Hearts.

1323
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:19,680
Kingdom Hearts.

1324
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,540
Oh wait, so if I put in Kingdom Hearts, the songs don't show up.

1325
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,900
But if I put in Utada Hikaru, they do.

1326
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,560
Eyes on Me.

1327
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,940
I think I sang Eyes on Me last time.

1328
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:32,240
Hmm.

1329
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,440
A Sanctuary.

1330
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,480
The English one.

1331
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,640
Oh my gosh.

1332
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,420
Utada Hikaru.

1333
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:41,920
Blah blah blah.

1334
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:42,580
Oh there it is.

1335
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,060
It fixed itself.

1336
01:35:58,270 --> 01:35:59,110
Excuse me?

1337
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,610
Excuse me?

1338
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:00,390
Excuse me?

1339
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:00,990
Excuse me?

1340
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:01,010
Excuse me?

1341
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:01,410
Excuse

1342
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:17,750
me?

1343
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,110
Excuse me?

1344
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,310
Like the English one?

1345
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:32,750
Like the English one.

1346
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:33,290
A Sanctuary.

1347
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,810
Ew.

1348
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:35,050
I like it.

1349
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:35,490
Or's it a Sanctuary.

1350
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:36,730
Ew.

1351
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,370
Ew wrong.

1352
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:38,330
Eww!

1353
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:40,330
Ew...

1354
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:43,650
Ew.

1355
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,090
Ew...

1356
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:00,390
I don't think I can sing this one very well, but that's okay.

1357
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:02,670
Wonk.

1358
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,550
Wonk.

1359
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,200
Wonk.

1360
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:16,770
It's so cool that they have the lyrics actually backwards.

1361
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:17,690
What?

1362
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:19,150
That's so awesome!

1363
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:22,090
I forgot how hard this song goes.

1364
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:36,470
Nothing is whole and nothing is broken.

1365
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,250
And you and I, there's a new land.

1366
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:56,410
My sanctuary, my sanctuary.

1367
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:57,490
Yeah.

1368
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:01,110
Where fears and lies melt away.

1369
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:08,070
You leave me alone.

1370
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:10,270
Why do you leave me alone?

1371
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:12,110
What's left of me?

1372
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:15,430
What's left of me now?

1373
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:17,290
My

1374
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:28,650
fears, my lies Felt away.

1375
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:53,740
You left me alone.

1376
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:59,620
This song is so hard to sing.

1377
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:05,520
I believe that there are just some songs that Utada Hikaru can only sing.

1378
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,180
Wonk.

1379
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:09,460
Yay.

1380
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,700
Request Eyes on Me from Final Fantasy 8.

1381
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,440
I can probably find it somewhere.

1382
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,180
I will find it.

1383
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:17,660
Let's see.

1384
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,520
I have to go to YouTube though.

1385
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,360
I'm pretty sure I did Eyes on Me though.

1386
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:24,800
Eyes on me.

1387
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,340
Instrumenta.

1388
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,340
Is there a...

1389
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:34,000
Oh, here we go.

1390
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,220
I think I did this one before.

1391
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,140
Sorry, you'll just have to see...

1392
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,080
You'll just see...

1393
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,800
You'll just see Carofan but nothing else.

1394
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,010
Nothing moving.

1395
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:26,510
Not here.

1396
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:28,710
And there's a letter.

1397
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:31,170
I'm sorry about that.

1398
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:31,190
It's just so beautiful.

1399
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:31,210
You're welcome.

1400
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,050
Bye-bye.

1401
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:32,830
Have a nice day.

1402
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:33,870
See you soon.

1403
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:34,290
Bye -bye.

1404
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,690
See you soon.

1405
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:39,990
Bye.

1406
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:40,670
Bye-bye.

1407
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:41,070
Bye-bye.

1408
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:45,930
Was it real or just my fantasy?

1409
01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:56,650
You'd always be there in the corner of this tiny little bar.

1410
01:41:57,570 --> 01:42:01,550
My last night here for you.

1411
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:07,430
Same old songs, just once more.

1412
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:12,090
My last night here with you.

1413
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:17,350
Maybe yes, maybe no.

1414
01:42:18,890 --> 01:42:23,370
I kind of liked it your way.

1415
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:29,050
How you shyly placed your eyes on me.

1416
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:39,130
But did you ever know that I had mine on you?

1417
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:46,410
Darling, so there you are.

1418
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:51,810
With that look on your face.

1419
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:56,490
As if you'd never heard.

1420
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:01,810
As if you're never down.

1421
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:07,090
Shall I be the one for you?

1422
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:13,670
Who pinches you softly but sure?

1423
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:23,190
If frown is shown then I will know that you are no dreamer.

1424
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:56,270
So let me come to you.

1425
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:01,710
Close as I want to be.

1426
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:06,650
Close enough for me.

1427
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:12,510
To feel your heart beating fast.

1428
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:17,770
And stay there as I whisper.

1429
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:23,690
How I loved your peaceful eyes on me.

1430
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:33,810
Did you ever know that I had mine on you?

1431
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:40,470
Darling, so share with me.

1432
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:45,690
Your love if you have enough.

1433
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:51,170
Your tears if you're holding back.

1434
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:57,010
Or pain if that's what it is.

1435
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:01,850
How can I let you know?

1436
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:08,630
I'm more than the dress and the voice.

1437
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:12,390
Just reach me out then.

1438
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:16,970
You will know that you are not dreaming.

1439
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:23,590
Darling, so there you are.

1440
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:29,170
With that look on your face.

1441
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,870
As if you'd never heard.

1442
01:45:35,490 --> 01:45:39,110
As if you're never down.

1443
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:44,410
Shall I be the one for you?

1444
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:51,010
Who pinches you softly but sure?

1445
01:45:52,370 --> 01:46:01,810
If frown is shown then I will know that you are no dreamer.

1446
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,770
The song is so long.

1447
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,180
Yay.

1448
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:22,300
Yay.

1449
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:23,680
Oh.

1450
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:24,920
Oh, oh.

1451
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:25,920
Don't listen to that end.

1452
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:26,140
Look.

1453
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:26,880
Thanks.

1454
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,380
Um.

1455
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:29,580
Outro.

1456
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:30,880
YouTube channel.

1457
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,320
YouTube channel outro.

1458
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:34,000
There's actually another song I want to sing.

1459
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:34,900
It's not.

1460
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:38,280
It is on Carafun but I want to show you.

1461
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,500
Actually, maybe I should just do the Carafun version.

1462
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:47,440
Maybe I should do.

1463
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:51,820
But it's like, it'll ruin the mood I think.

1464
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,160
Okay.

1465
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,060
Okay, I'm going to sing it and then I'm going to show you the Kara fun version.

1466
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,480
I'm going to sing it and then I'm going to show you the Kara fun version.

1467
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,460
Because it's so funny.

1468
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:01,180
Okay.

1469
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:04,240
Because I want you to hear it... I don't want you to hear it and like...

1470
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:06,600
Or see the lyrics and then be like, what the hell?

1471
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,360
And then I sing it and you're like, wait, it's already ruined.

1472
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:11,180
Okay.

1473
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,100
Song Kang!

1474
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:16,180
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

1475
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:17,940
Holy shit.

1476
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,400
Song Kang.

1477
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:22,620
Oh my god, sorry.

1478
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,620
That has an intro on the YouTube one.

1479
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,260
Holy moly.

1480
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,620
Oh my god, I'm so sorry, my...

1481
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:29,660
I'm so sorry.

1482
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:32,340
That hurt me as much as it hurt you guys, probably.

1483
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,240
I'm so sorry.

1484
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,840
I'm so sorry!

1485
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:39,520
Okay.

1486
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,880
Oh, thank god.

1487
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:44,600
It played it again?

1488
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:45,960
But I turned it off.

1489
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:46,300
Ah!

1490
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,320
God, sorry.

1491
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,760
You can't hear it, but I can.

1492
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,700
Shut up!

1493
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,140
Oh my god.

1494
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:51,760
Okay.

1495
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:52,720
Holy...

1496
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,380
It's so loud, even for me!

1497
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:58,680
Okay.

1498
01:47:59,180 --> 01:47:59,680
Okay.

1499
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,660
Okay, I'm gonna sing.

1500
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:06,420
The song is like, so not that type of song either, so it's funny.

1501
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,860
Oh, you could hear it a little bit.

1502
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:24,780
Day seems sometimes as if they'll never end.

1503
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:31,440
Sun digs heels to haunt you.

1504
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:35,640
But after sunlit days, one thing stays the same.

1505
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:38,140
Rises the moon.

1506
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:46,220
Days fade into a watercolor blur.

1507
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:52,860
Memories swim and haunt you.

1508
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,800
But look into the lake, shimmering like smoke.

1509
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,460
Rises the moon.

1510
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:10,160
Close your weary eyes.

1511
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:20,140
I promise you that soon the autumn comes to darken fading summer skies.

1512
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,160
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1513
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,680
Days pull you down just like a sinking ship.

1514
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:44,500
Floating is getting harder.

1515
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:51,520
But tread the water child and know that meanwhile rises the moon.

1516
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:59,410
Days pull you up just like a daffodil.

1517
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:15,910
A little pause...

1518
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:32,620
and we are back.

1519
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:52,070
I don't want there to be an outro.

1520
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:53,890
This channel scares me.

1521
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:55,130
Yay!

1522
01:50:55,290 --> 01:50:56,870
That was Rises the Moon.

1523
01:50:58,190 --> 01:50:59,590
Rises the Moon.

1524
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:01,290
It's a really pretty song.

1525
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:02,370
I think...

1526
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:04,830
I think...

1527
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:05,470
I think...

1528
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:08,570
There's some other songs I want to sing.

1529
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:09,530
We'll go back to Carrot Fun.

1530
01:51:10,270 --> 01:51:11,510
One of them is...

1531
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:14,230
I saw some people requesting Carpenters.

1532
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:14,750
Here you go.

1533
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:38,560
Why do birds suddenly appear?

1534
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:43,920
Every time you are near.

1535
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:50,940
Just like me, they long to be.

1536
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,460
Close to you.

1537
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:00,900
Why do stars fall down from the sky?

1538
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:06,020
Every time you walk by.

1539
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:13,020
Just like me, they long to be.

1540
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,440
Close to you.

1541
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:19,740
Just like me, they long to be.

1542
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:22,100
On the day that you were born.

1543
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:23,880
The angels got together.

1544
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:28,240
And decided to create a dream come true.

1545
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:32,380
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair.

1546
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:35,920
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue.

1547
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,120
That is why.

1548
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:44,600
All the girls in the town.

1549
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:46,920
Follow you.

1550
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:48,940
All around.

1551
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:53,360
Just like me.

1552
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,460
They long to be.

1553
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,740
Close to you.

1554
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:02,960
On the day that you were born.

1555
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:03,640
The angels got together.

1556
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:06,520
And decided to create a dream come true.

1557
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,480
That is why.

1558
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:08,300
All the girls in the town.

1559
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:09,140
They long to be.

1560
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:11,650
Close to you.

1561
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:14,430
On the day

1562
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:26,910
that you were born.

1563
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:27,490
The angels got together.

1564
01:53:27,490 --> 01:53:28,990
The angels got together.

1565
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:33,270
And decided to create a dream come true.

1566
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:37,530
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair.

1567
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:40,950
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue.

1568
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:46,330
That is why.

1569
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:49,750
All the girls in the town.

1570
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:51,950
Follow you.

1571
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:54,130
All around.

1572
01:53:56,350 --> 01:53:57,470
Just like me.

1573
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:01,210
They long to be.

1574
01:54:01,450 --> 01:54:03,610
Close to you.

1575
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:06,990
On the day that you were born.

1576
01:54:07,010 --> 01:54:07,870
The angels got together.

1577
01:54:07,870 --> 01:54:09,130
Just like me.

1578
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:12,010
They long to be.

1579
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:15,870
Close to you.

1580
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:24,290
On the day that you were born.

1581
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:24,590
And decided to create a dream come true.

1582
01:54:24,770 --> 01:54:25,810
That is why.

1583
01:54:29,950 --> 01:54:32,010
All the girls in the town.

1584
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:32,090
They long to be.

1585
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:38,700
On the day that you were born.

1586
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:42,240
Close to you.

1587
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:42,920
Close to you.

1588
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:43,760
Close to you.

1589
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,980
Remember I sing the song.

1590
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:46,280
I hold my little baby snake.

1591
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,680
And I sing to him.

1592
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:53,780
Close to you.

1593
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:04,470
Close to you.

1594
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:21,120
A cheeky spirit on Twitter told me you are an enjoyer of Cultured Ren fan manga and I appear to say base.

1595
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:23,800
Also, I forget how beautiful your singing is.

1596
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,280
Thank you for the super chat!

1597
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:28,700
Close to you.

1598
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,620
I love you little snake.

1599
01:55:30,820 --> 01:55:33,420
Okay, go back to standing on my desk as you always are.

1600
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,880
I got a snake from a gacha.

1601
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:39,040
A snake figure.

1602
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:41,560
And I sing to him every time.

1603
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:50,300
Whether now or in the future, I think it would be real nice to hear you sing Don't Speak by No Doubt.

1604
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:52,000
Even if it would be lethal.

1605
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:54,260
Don't speak by no doubt.

1606
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,840
Don't speak by no doubt.

1607
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,460
Hopelessly devoted to you from Greece?

1608
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,240
I've never sung that before.

1609
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:08,860
Could you sing fine on the outside?

1610
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:09,520
Oh, I can!

1611
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:11,280
Wait, hold on.

1612
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,300
Let me hear the Don't Speak.

1613
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,560
Do I know this song?

1614
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:18,140
No.

1615
01:56:19,020 --> 01:56:20,420
You

1616
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:51,050
and me We used to be together Every day together Always I really feel That I'm losing my best friend I can't believe this could be The end It looks as though

1617
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:11,770
A little pause... and we are back.

1618
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:17,110
A little pause... and we are

1619
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:22,810
back.

1620
01:57:40,330 --> 01:57:58,370
A little pause... and we are back.

1621
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:17,270
Oh my god, I haven't heard this song forever.

1622
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:19,970
It's not ending.

1623
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:22,690
Stop pretending.

1624
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:24,630
Who we are.

1625
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:26,650
I don't know this part.

1626
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:31,370
Oh my god.

1627
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:33,710
I have not heard this song in so long.

1628
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:36,490
So I don't remember it very well.

1629
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:36,890
I'm sorry.

1630
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,520
You and me.

1631
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:01,080
And I can see us dying.

1632
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:02,760
Are we?

1633
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:05,840
Don't speak.

1634
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,620
I know just what you're saying.

1635
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,600
So please stop explaining.

1636
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,800
Don't tell me cause it hurts.

1637
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:16,760
No, no.

1638
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:17,620
No, no.

1639
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:18,480
Don't speak.

1640
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,460
I know what you're thinking.

1641
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,700
And I don't need your reasons.

1642
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,500
Don't tell me cause it hurts.

1643
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,860
Don't tell me cause it hurts.

1644
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,860
I know what you're saying.

1645
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,840
So please stop explaining.

1646
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:39,280
Don't speak.

1647
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,760
Don't speak.

1648
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:42,440
Don't speak.

1649
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,180
Oh.

1650
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:46,740
I know what you're thinking.

1651
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:49,960
And I don't need your reasons.

1652
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,460
I know you're good.

1653
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:52,860
I know you're good.

1654
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,780
I know you're real good.

1655
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:55,860
Oh.

1656
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:58,000
La la la.

1657
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:25,340
Lush.

1658
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:26,220
Darling.

1659
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:40,190
Yay.

1660
02:00:42,290 --> 02:00:43,090
Let's see.

1661
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,170
I did...

1662
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:46,050
Close to you.

1663
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:48,210
Don't speak.

1664
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:50,930
Um.

1665
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:54,470
You're singing my karaoke song.

1666
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:55,510
Sorry if I...

1667
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:57,850
Butchered it then.

1668
02:00:59,170 --> 02:01:00,090
Hush, hush.

1669
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:01,310
Hush, hush.

1670
02:01:02,190 --> 02:01:02,870
Push, push.

1671
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,430
Kiss from a rose.

1672
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:13,650
Oh my gosh.

1673
02:01:16,130 --> 02:01:17,530
Have I ever sung this song before?

1674
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:18,230
I don't think so.

1675
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:23,830
I met Seal.

1676
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:25,150
No, not Seal.

1677
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:25,870
Wait...

1678
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:28,070
A Seal!

1679
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:29,450
A SEAL.

1680
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:33,730
I think I'm confusing artists.

1681
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:35,010
Silly guys.

1682
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:43,470
You remember me by Juul.

1683
02:01:43,590 --> 02:01:44,950
I don't know if I know that one.

1684
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:46,710
I hope he didn't know.

1685
02:01:46,710 --> 02:01:47,270
David

1686
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:58,630
Matропik.

1687
02:01:58,750 --> 02:01:59,550
American Idol.

1688
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:02,190
Once upon a time...

1689
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:34,190
And you became the light on the dark side of me And love remained way at your heart That's the heart, not the pill But did you know that when it snows My eyes become larger The light that you shine can be seen Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose On the gray Ooh,

1690
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:50,310
the more I get of you The stranger it feels, yeah And now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom On the gray What does that mean?

1691
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:53,470
A kiss from a rose on the gray?

1692
02:02:53,710 --> 02:02:54,670
What's the gray?

1693
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:58,430
I don't understand it.

1694
02:03:01,730 --> 02:03:22,370
There's so much a man can tell you So much he can say You remain my power My pleasure, my pain Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction I can't even deny Won't you tell me is it the healthy baby?

1695
02:03:22,710 --> 02:03:56,890
Oh wait, but did you know That when it snows My eyes become larger The light that you shine can be seen Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose On the gray Ooh, the more I get of you The stranger it feels, yeah And now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom On the gray She's basically deep.

1696
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:58,310
What do you mean by that?

1697
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:02,360
It's meant to be abstract.

1698
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:03,780
A

1699
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:39,620
kiss from a rose on the gray A kiss from a rose on the gray A kiss from a rose on the gray A kiss from a rose on the gray There is so much a man can tell you Oh gosh, I don't remember this.

1700
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:55,280
He can say You remain my power My pleasure, my pain Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction I can't even deny Won't you tell me is it the healthy baby?

1701
02:04:55,440 --> 02:05:28,540
Oh wait, but did you know That when it snows My eyes become larger The light that you shine can be seen Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose On the gray Ooh, the more I get of you The stranger it feels, yeah And now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom On the gray Yes,

1702
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:54,150
I compare you to a kiss from a rose On the gray Ooh, the more I get of you The stranger it feels, yeah And now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom On the gray This isn't about drugs, is it?

1703
02:05:56,030 --> 02:06:10,600
Now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom On the gray

1704
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:14,980
Drugs?

1705
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:15,340
No!

1706
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:18,700
It's about kissing roses.

1707
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:19,520
Obviously!

1708
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:30,620
Most common views are either touching the edge of death Or the rose bringing back vibrance to life that was depressive and gray.

1709
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,080
See, that sounds so nice!

1710
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:34,600
It's about love, I think.

1711
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:36,880
Yeah.

1712
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:37,640
See?

1713
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:39,260
Gosh, you guys.

1714
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:41,420
It's about love.

1715
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,400
It's about love.

1716
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:46,880
Is it about anything?

1717
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:47,920
Who knows?

1718
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:49,500
Who knows?

1719
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:51,640
What time is it?

1720
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:55,020
I've only been... I've sung 22 songs in...

1721
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:56,920
2 hours?

1722
02:06:58,460 --> 02:06:59,300
That's so many.

1723
02:06:59,400 --> 02:06:59,660
Hold on.

1724
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:00,800
I'm gonna eat some more of my food.

1725
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:01,420
I hope it's okay.

1726
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:04,760
Let's take a little break.

1727
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:07,820
Let's take a little tiny break.

1728
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:14,540
Let me eat.

1729
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,720
Break time!

1730
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:27,560
So I can eat my food.

1731
02:07:40,710 --> 02:07:41,930
Yeah, this will be archived.

1732
02:07:41,990 --> 02:07:42,430
Don't worry.

1733
02:07:43,110 --> 02:07:45,050
You're like, I wanna go watch something else.

1734
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,230
Yeah, I get it.

1735
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,100
I don't want you to hear me.

1736
02:07:59,280 --> 02:07:59,880
Hold on.

1737
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:19,300
I'm like eating it so fast.

1738
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,400
I'm eating it so fast.

1739
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:24,640
My tummy started to growl though.

1740
02:08:44,370 --> 02:08:44,950
You know what?

1741
02:08:44,990 --> 02:08:46,010
Don't watch me eat either.

1742
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:47,450
I'm gonna turn around.

1743
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:56,620
There we go.

1744
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:59,540
Now you can't listen to me.

1745
02:08:59,640 --> 02:08:59,960
Wait.

1746
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:01,200
Hold on.

1747
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:02,460
I'm gonna stand away from the light.

1748
02:09:02,700 --> 02:09:03,320
Hold on.

1749
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:10,740
Okay.

1750
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:11,860
Okay.

1751
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,260
Probably.

1752
02:09:34,350 --> 02:09:36,590
She moves away from the mic to breathe.

1753
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:58,820
Her 4 was your lucky number.

1754
02:09:59,180 --> 02:09:59,760
Thanks!

1755
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:00,220
Thanks!

1756
02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:06,660
Chocolate Rain Some Say...

1757
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:08,860
Is that true that song is about pooping?

1758
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:13,960
Is it true that song is about pooping?

1759
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:17,880
I hope not...

1760
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,680
I got some broccoli on my desk.

1761
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:33,740
Okay.

1762
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:36,440
See you tomorrow.

1763
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:41,300
Into the trash!

1764
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:44,380
There we go.

1765
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:47,160
I think you can sing six... wait...

1766
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:50,100
Kiss me by sixpence none the richer.

1767
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:51,580
Yeah, I can sing that one.

1768
02:10:57,980 --> 02:10:59,940
Chocolate rain isn't about pooping, it's not?

1769
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:05,580
I don't know, I just remember hearing that as a kid.

1770
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:10,220
People were like, some stay dry while others feel the pain.

1771
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:11,780
Chocolate rain.

1772
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:18,090
It's about what?

1773
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:20,130
Oh, I think I'm way off.

1774
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:22,270
I

1775
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:28,010
only know the chocolate rain.

1776
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:32,430
My bad.

1777
02:11:32,590 --> 02:11:34,110
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

1778
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:35,590
I just had no idea.

1779
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:53,280
I regret my words in action.

1780
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:59,580
I regret my words in action.

1781
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:00,480
I regret my words in action, my words and deeds.

1782
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:18,580
Fabulous from High School Musical 2?

1783
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:20,500
Oh my gosh, I don't know if I...

1784
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:23,920
I don't know if I know it very well.

1785
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:30,290
That's the one that goes...

1786
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:31,630
I'm feeling fabulous.

1787
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:33,870
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1788
02:12:34,670 --> 02:12:35,150
Fabulous.

1789
02:12:35,550 --> 02:12:35,910
That's the one.

1790
02:12:36,030 --> 02:12:37,330
I don't know what.

1791
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:53,560
I don't know what.

1792
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:54,220
Is this archived?

1793
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:54,640
I don't know.

1794
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:55,360
Maybe not anymore.

1795
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:01,180
Maybe not anymore.

1796
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:02,020
Maybe not anymore.

1797
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:02,040
Well.

1798
02:13:20,290 --> 02:13:21,210
No, I'm just kidding.

1799
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:23,670
What was I gonna do?

1800
02:13:24,170 --> 02:13:29,410
I wonder if... I wonder if this is on here.

1801
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:40,390
No, I'm gonna have to find an instrumental on YouTube.

1802
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,760
Let me check if this one works.

1803
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:53,360
Sorry, you're gonna hear no music.

1804
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:00,300
I think so.

1805
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:05,660
I don't hear some awful, terrible intro or anything, so let's do this one.

1806
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:09,920
Okay.

1807
02:14:10,340 --> 02:14:10,820
Okay!

1808
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,720
Calliope Mori's End of a Life.

1809
02:14:16,780 --> 02:14:17,640
There's a karaoke version.

1810
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:18,620
Oh!

1811
02:14:19,300 --> 02:14:20,360
I don't know though.

1812
02:14:21,340 --> 02:14:22,700
I like that song a lot.

1813
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:25,680
I've never tried singing it.

1814
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:29,540
I'm so nervous to sing... to sing other YouTuber songs sometimes.

1815
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,080
I'll think about it though.

1816
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:37,460
Maybe one day I'll do like a dedicated Hololive karaoke.

1817
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:42,860
Maybe I'll do a dedicated Hololive karaoke sometime.

1818
02:14:43,220 --> 02:14:45,620
Because I've been singing a lot of Stellar Stellar.

1819
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:50,760
I've been singing so... or not singing, but like listening to Stellar Stellar so much.

1820
02:14:53,820 --> 02:14:54,800
Calli won't mind.

1821
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,820
I don't know.

1822
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:58,040
I'm afraid of upsetting people.

1823
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:01,900
So... I don't know.

1824
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,640
If I do upset people, I would at least do the songs justice, you know?

1825
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:09,120
Hmm.

1826
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:10,660
We'll see.

1827
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:12,400
We'll see.

1828
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:15,200
Okay.

1829
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,860
Okie dokie.

1830
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:21,680
I'm gonna write a few more of this... some of the requests that I've seen.

1831
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:24,620
That I'm thinking of.

1832
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:26,600
Um... actually...

1833
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:30,920
Now I'm... now I can't remember any of it.

1834
02:15:30,940 --> 02:15:31,200
You know what?

1835
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:32,700
Let's just... we'll just... we'll just play by ear.

1836
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:33,820
Okay.

1837
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:38,140
Oh!

1838
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:38,540
Oh!

1839
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:38,840
Oh!

1840
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:39,020
Oh!

1841
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,500
I started playing it, but you guys couldn't hear it.

1842
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:41,760
There we go.

1843
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:42,040
Okay.

1844
02:15:52,940 --> 02:16:00,380
I never had that many friends growing up, so I learned to be...

1845
02:16:00,380 --> 02:16:07,460
Okay with just me.

1846
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:10,120
Just me.

1847
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:12,500
Just me.

1848
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:14,800
Just me.

1849
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:21,480
And I'll be fine on the outside.

1850
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:29,190
I like to eat in school by myself.

1851
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:32,450
Anyway.

1852
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:37,830
So I'll just stay...

1853
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:40,590
Right here.

1854
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:43,230
Right here.

1855
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:45,630
Right here.

1856
02:16:46,050 --> 02:16:47,690
Right here.

1857
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:54,430
And I'll be fine on the outside.

1858
02:16:56,890 --> 02:16:58,970
So I just say...

1859
02:16:59,190 --> 02:17:02,630
I'll just sit in my room after hours with the moon.

1860
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:08,590
And think of who knows my name.

1861
02:17:09,090 --> 02:17:11,890
Would you cry if I died?

1862
02:17:12,130 --> 02:17:15,730
Would you remember my face?

1863
02:17:20,190 --> 02:17:21,170
So

1864
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:36,900
I left home, I packed up and I

1865
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:46,040
asked one day.

1866
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,230
And I laughed.

1867
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,440
I laughed.

1868
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:51,460
I laughed.

1869
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:52,500
I

1870
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:02,690
sound fine on the outside.

1871
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:05,970
Ooh.

1872
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:08,090
I'm

1873
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:27,120
lost.

1874
02:18:27,300 --> 02:18:29,520
Sometimes I'm confused.

1875
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:37,340
Sometimes I find that I am not alright.

1876
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:40,140
And I cry.

1877
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:42,260
And I...

1878
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:21,440
So I just sit in my room after hours with the moon.

1879
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:27,440
And think of who knows my name.

1880
02:19:27,900 --> 02:19:30,760
Would you cry if I died?

1881
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,300
Would you remember my face?

1882
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:52,110
That one's kind of hard to sing.

1883
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:56,890
Fine on the outside.

1884
02:19:58,910 --> 02:19:59,370
Yeah.

1885
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:01,230
Let's see.

1886
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:03,050
Another one that people were asking for.

1887
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:03,510
Oh!

1888
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:05,250
There was one that I wanted to sing.

1889
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,120
How do I...

1890
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:10,520
Oh, it's a...

1891
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:11,020
What's it called?

1892
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:16,240
Hold on.

1893
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:17,860
I have it.

1894
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:20,960
The tippy, tippy, tippy, tippy of my tongue.

1895
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:22,520
Oh!

1896
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:26,340
Maybe if I search this.

1897
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:27,100
Okay.

1898
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:31,480
I've never actually seen Steven Universe before.

1899
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:33,420
But I really like the music.

1900
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:37,380
So I'm going to sing this one next.

1901
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:54,380
If I could begin to be half of what you think of me.

1902
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:56,160
I could do about anything.

1903
02:20:56,380 --> 02:20:59,520
I could even learn how to love.

1904
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:03,800
When I see the way you act.

1905
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:06,580
Wondering when I'm coming back.

1906
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:08,400
I could do about anything.

1907
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:11,700
I could even learn how to love.

1908
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:13,560
Like you.

1909
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:19,320
Love like you.

1910
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,560
I

1911
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:39,180
always thought I might be bad.

1912
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:42,000
Now I'm sure that it's true.

1913
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,100
I think you're so good.

1914
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:48,220
And I'm nothing like you.

1915
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:49,620
Look at you go.

1916
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:51,720
I just adore you.

1917
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:54,120
I wish that I knew.

1918
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:59,860
What makes you think I'm so special.

1919
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:07,940
If I could begin to do something that does right by you.

1920
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:10,300
I would do about anything.

1921
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:14,260
I would even learn how to love.

1922
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:22,640
When I see the way you look.

1923
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:25,580
Shaken by how long it took.

1924
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:27,440
I could do about anything.

1925
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:32,500
I could even learn how to love like you.

1926
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:38,500
Love me like you.

1927
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:44,580
Love me like you.

1928
02:22:59,740 --> 02:23:02,200
This song is so pretty.

1929
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:03,680
Oh my god.

1930
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:06,840
Love like you.

1931
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:10,700
Yay!

1932
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:16,280
Let's see.

1933
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:19,620
Let's see.

1934
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:21,540
There's... I don't know this other one though.

1935
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:23,140
But I like it.

1936
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:27,400
I know it a little bit but I might mess up the middle part.

1937
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,180
I'm gonna try it anyway.

1938
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:32,120
If I mess it up, sorry.

1939
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:40,600
I was fine.

1940
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,660
With the men.

1941
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:46,360
Who would come into our life now and again.

1942
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:48,620
I was fine.

1943
02:23:49,220 --> 02:23:50,420
Cause I knew.

1944
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:54,480
That they didn't really matter until you.

1945
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:56,960
I was fine.

1946
02:23:57,480 --> 02:23:59,020
When you came.

1947
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:02,980
And we fought like it was all some silly game.

1948
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,660
Over her.

1949
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,680
Who'd she choose?

1950
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:09,280
After all those years.

1951
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:11,960
I never thought I'd lose.

1952
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:14,500
It's over.

1953
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:15,700
Isn't it?

1954
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,300
Isn't it?

1955
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:19,480
Isn't it over?

1956
02:24:20,290 --> 02:24:21,280
It's over.

1957
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:22,580
Isn't it?

1958
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:24,180
Isn't it?

1959
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:24,460
Isn't it over?

1960
02:24:24,460 --> 02:24:27,600
You won.

1961
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:29,720
And she chose you.

1962
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:31,420
And she loved you.

1963
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:32,980
And she's gone.

1964
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:35,080
It's over.

1965
02:24:35,260 --> 02:24:35,880
Isn't it?

1966
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,780
Why can't I move on?

1967
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:42,140
War and glory.

1968
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:43,880
Reinvention.

1969
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:44,620
Fusion.

1970
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:45,500
Freedom.

1971
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:46,740
Her attention.

1972
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,720
Out in daylight.

1973
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:50,140
My potential.

1974
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:50,940
Bold.

1975
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:51,980
Precise.

1976
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:53,680
Experimental.

1977
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,520
Who am I now in this world without her?

1978
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:57,980
Petty and dull.

1979
02:24:58,160 --> 02:24:59,600
With the nerve to doubt her.

1980
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:01,180
What does it matter?

1981
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,680
It's already done.

1982
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:05,600
Now I've got to be there for a sign.

1983
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:07,340
It's over.

1984
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:08,760
Isn't it?

1985
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:10,140
Isn't it?

1986
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:12,120
Isn't it over?

1987
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:13,780
It's over.

1988
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:15,160
Isn't it?

1989
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:16,520
Isn't it?

1990
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:18,580
Isn't it over?

1991
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:19,760
You won.

1992
02:25:19,900 --> 02:25:21,640
And she chose you.

1993
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:23,280
And she loved you.

1994
02:25:23,300 --> 02:25:23,660
And she loved you.

1995
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:30,000
It's over, isn't it?

1996
02:25:30,020 --> 02:25:33,160
Why can't I move on?

1997
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:47,920
It's so Jover.

1998
02:25:48,530 --> 02:25:50,640
It's Jover, isn't it?

1999
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,200
Isn't it?

2000
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,340
Isn't it Jover?

2001
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,720
It's Jover, isn't it?

2002
02:25:58,500 --> 02:25:59,120
Isn't it?

2003
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:00,240
Thank you!

2004
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:03,560
I'm on a flight to Colombia!

2005
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:05,720
Wow, how fun!

2006
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:10,320
I want to thank you for inspiring me to visit new places and get out of my comfort zone!

2007
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:13,520
Can you sing Shakira or any songs from Encanto?

2008
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:16,120
Thank you for always being amazing!

2009
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:20,960
I don't know if I know very many Shakira songs that well, but I can sing Encanto!

2010
02:26:22,980 --> 02:26:23,460
Encanto...

2011
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:28,840
What's a song that I could sing?

2012
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:32,060
It's Fantover!

2013
02:26:41,180 --> 02:26:45,340
I think maybe the best thing I could do is we don't talk about Bruno, maybe.

2014
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:47,280
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

2015
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:49,940
Why did you make me cry in the middle of my work?

2016
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:50,700
Don't cry!

2017
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:51,780
Don't cry!

2018
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:52,360
Don't cry!

2019
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:54,820
Oh...

2020
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:57,220
I only really know...

2021
02:26:57,220 --> 02:27:00,120
We don't talk about Bruno and the family Madrigal.

2022
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:03,700
But I don't think I could sing that one very well because it's kind of fast.

2023
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:04,460
I've never sung it before.

2024
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:05,740
We don't talk about Bruno.

2025
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:07,140
I'm going to sing all the parts.

2026
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:11,560
Oh my God!

2027
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:11,820
Hi!

2028
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:13,260
Thank you for the 50s!

2029
02:27:13,260 --> 02:27:13,660
Thank you!

2030
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:17,820
About Bruno, no, no, no, no.

2031
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:20,420
We don't talk about Bruno.

2032
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,360
But...

2033
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:24,400
It was my wedding day.

2034
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:25,540
We were getting ready...

2035
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:26,080
Wait, hold on.

2036
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:27,340
Oh, there.

2037
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:29,480
There's a cloud in the sky.

2038
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:31,740
There's a cloud so loud in the sky.

2039
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:35,300
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin.

2040
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:36,360
I'm there.

2041
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:38,760
You're telling the story, aren't I?

2042
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:40,580
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on.

2043
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:43,600
Bruno said it looks like rain.

2044
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:45,200
What did he tell us?

2045
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:48,180
In doing so, he floods my brain.

2046
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:49,600
I wanna kiss the umbrella.

2047
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:52,100
Married in a hurry.

2048
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:52,860
Again.

2049
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,100
What a joyous day.

2050
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:54,980
But anyway.

2051
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:57,560
We don't talk about Bruno.

2052
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:59,640
No, no, no, no.

2053
02:28:00,060 --> 02:28:02,260
We don't talk about Bruno.

2054
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:04,000
Hey!

2055
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:05,480
Grew to live in Peru.

2056
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:06,520
Bruno started stumbling.

2057
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:08,260
I can always hear him sort of mumbling.

2058
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:10,140
I associate with...

2059
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:12,380
I messed it up.

2060
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:13,240
I couldn't remember.

2061
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:15,960
It's a heavy lift with the gifts so humbling.

2062
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:18,180
Always left the abuela and the family fumbling.

2063
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:20,580
Grappling with the prophecies they couldn't understand.

2064
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:22,320
Do you understand?

2065
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:24,540
Seven-foot frame.

2066
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:26,780
Rats so long as back.

2067
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:29,000
When he calls your name.

2068
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,100
I forgot that part was coming up.

2069
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:31,480
It all faced the black.

2070
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:33,920
Yeah, he sees your dreams.

2071
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:36,260
And freestyles your screams.

2072
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:39,540
We don't talk about Bruno.

2073
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:41,640
No, no, no, no.

2074
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:44,260
We don't talk about Bruno.

2075
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:48,260
He told me my fish would die.

2076
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:48,740
Excuse me.

2077
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:50,940
Oh, no.

2078
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:52,300
He told me I'd be dead.

2079
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:52,980
He said Bruno grew a gun.

2080
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:54,540
And just like he said.

2081
02:28:54,940 --> 02:28:55,600
He said no.

2082
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:57,560
All my hair would disappear.

2083
02:28:57,620 --> 02:28:59,280
Now look at my head.

2084
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:00,320
No, no.

2085
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:04,120
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read.

2086
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:12,080
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and someday be mine.

2087
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:21,420
He told me that my power would grow like the grapes that thrive on the vine.

2088
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:22,280
He said Bruno grew a gun.

2089
02:29:23,140 --> 02:29:51,040
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach but drove to another it's like I hear him now it's like I hear him now I can hear him now Bruno yeah about that Bruno I really need to know about Bruno give me the truth and the whole truth Bruno No,

2090
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:53,900
Isabella, your boyfriend's here!

2091
02:29:54,480 --> 02:29:55,780
Da-da!

2092
02:29:55,880 --> 02:30:34,620
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and someday be mine He told me that my power would grow like the grapes that thrive on the vine He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised and someday be mine He told me that my power would grow like the grapes we talk about Bruno Oh my

2093
02:30:39,250 --> 02:30:40,790
god.

2094
02:30:41,010 --> 02:30:43,330
This song is so crazy towards the end.

2095
02:30:49,970 --> 02:30:51,610
Thank you for the donut.

2096
02:30:52,730 --> 02:31:01,350
Superman my goldfinger, spiderwebs by no doubt, or centaria by sublime Maybe next time... I don't know if I... Maybe I would have to hear them and I would know.

2097
02:31:02,570 --> 02:31:03,290
Next time.

2098
02:31:03,350 --> 02:31:04,550
I will make a note of those.

2099
02:31:07,310 --> 02:31:08,270
Bruno... Bruno...

2100
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:16,750
We don't talk about Bruno, no We don't talk about Bruno We don't talk about... about...

2101
02:31:17,430 --> 02:31:18,530
Bruno... Wait...

2102
02:31:19,030 --> 02:31:20,330
We don't talk about...

2103
02:31:20,330 --> 02:31:22,230
We don't talk about...

2104
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:25,470
Mint singing Bruno

2105
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:32,770
Scared by Roy Orbison Or not... Or not that...

2106
02:31:32,770 --> 02:31:36,270
Maybe the Phantom of the Opera The Phantom of the Opera!

2107
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:40,640
Duh...

2108
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:44,220
The Opera...

2109
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:45,860
Which song from Phantom of the Opera?

2110
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:49,780
Which song from Phantom of the Opera?

2111
02:31:52,420 --> 02:31:52,820
Hmm...

2112
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:56,180
I did All I Ask of You last time.

2113
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:04,100
The Phantom... Mint Phantom of the Opera What about the song from Over the Garden Wall?

2114
02:32:05,440 --> 02:32:05,840
Um...

2115
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:07,780
I don't know if it's on here.

2116
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:08,060
I'll check.

2117
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:09,600
Will He Joji?

2118
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:09,880
Oh!

2119
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,420
I only know one Joji song.

2120
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:14,040
Music of the Night

2121
02:32:23,170 --> 02:32:24,110
Point of No Return?

2122
02:32:24,210 --> 02:32:24,330
No!

2123
02:32:24,390 --> 02:32:25,590
That song is too sexy!

2124
02:32:30,010 --> 02:32:31,990
How does this go?

2125
02:32:32,270 --> 02:32:33,670
High

2126
02:32:39,070 --> 02:33:17,870
time sharpens Heightens each sensation Darkness wakes and Stirs imagination Silently the senses Abandon their defenses Helpless to resist The notes I write Fork I compose The music of the night Is this sung by Phantom?

2127
02:33:18,730 --> 02:33:20,130
Slowly...

2128
02:33:20,130 --> 02:33:22,230
Gently...

2129
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:28,230
Night unfurls its splendor Grasp it...

2130
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:30,030
Sends it...

2131
02:33:30,030 --> 02:33:31,470
Tremulous...

2132
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:34,150
And tender...

2133
02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:58,850
Hearing is believing Music is deceiving Hard as lightning Soft as candlelight Dare you trust The music of the night Close your eyes For your...

2134
02:33:58,850 --> 02:34:00,470
Tell the...

2135
02:34:00,470 --> 02:34:05,290
Tell the truth And the truth is...

2136
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:07,850
Oh my god, my mic is peaking.

2137
02:34:08,130 --> 02:34:12,750
...Seal In the dark it...

2138
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:14,570
Is here to...

2139
02:34:14,570 --> 02:34:17,750
...Pretend Time...

2140
02:34:21,950 --> 02:34:23,870
Is wanted...

2141
02:34:23,870 --> 02:34:25,790
...Onto me

2142
02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:31,200
Softly...

2143
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:33,200
...Deafly...

2144
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:40,800
...Music shall caress you Hear it...

2145
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,020
Feel it...

2146
02:34:43,020 --> 02:35:04,760
...Sacrantly possess you Open up your mind Let your fantasies unwind In this darkness which you know You cannot find The darkness of the...

2147
02:35:04,760 --> 02:35:08,320
...Music of the night Through

2148
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:32,340
a strange new world Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before Close your eyes and let music set you free Oh, not a good...

2149
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:32,940
Not the best...

2150
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:34,260
Only then...

2151
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:36,900
...You can you...

2152
02:35:36,860 --> 02:35:40,460
...Belong to me ...

2153
02:35:42,140 --> 02:35:42,840
Ugh...

2154
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,520
Glower widely...

2155
02:35:46,940 --> 02:35:48,340
Falling...

2156
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:54,060
Sweet intoxication...

2157
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:56,900
Touching...

2158
02:35:58,340 --> 02:35:59,740
Trusting...

2159
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:01,700
Savor...

2160
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:02,400
...Reach...

2161
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:03,920
...Then sin...

2162
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:05,360
...Destination...

2163
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:27,000
Let the dream begin Let your darker side give in To the power of the music that I write The power of the music of the night

2164
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:33,800
Oh!

2165
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:34,000
Gosh!

2166
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:34,140
What is this?

2167
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:34,240
Oh my arms!

2168
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:35,780
There's gonna be a episode ...

2169
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:36,460
Congratulations...

2170
02:36:39,740 --> 02:36:40,540
...At last...!

2171
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:44,860
Um...

2172
02:36:54,290 --> 02:36:58,210
I'm trying to speak Um...

2173
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:12,590
Wait, hold on.

2174
02:37:12,590 --> 02:37:13,270
I want to hear that one.

2175
02:37:15,310 --> 02:37:19,530
When it says, help me, all I can think of is, help me white girl.

2176
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:25,150
Yes!

2177
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,200
We can go back to Disney.

2178
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:54,620
I like singing like things obviously that I like to sing.

2179
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:56,120
But it's also really fun to sing.

2180
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:59,420
Like, you know, I sing Phantom of the Opera, I feel, pretty often.

2181
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:05,820
I've never sung Music of the Night before, so it's kind of fun.

2182
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,860
Make a man out of you.

2183
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:32,020
Make a wisp out of you.

2184
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:34,720
Well, hi Raiders!

2185
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:35,200
Thank you!

2186
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:38,840
Let's get down to business.

2187
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:43,880
Defeat the Huns.

2188
02:38:44,470 --> 02:38:51,140
Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?

2189
02:38:52,410 --> 02:38:56,120
You're the saddest bunch I ever met.

2190
02:38:56,380 --> 02:38:59,560
But you can bet, before we're through.

2191
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:05,900
Mr. Al, make a man out of you.

2192
02:39:10,060 --> 02:39:16,240
Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within.

2193
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:24,880
Once you find your center, you are sure to win.

2194
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:33,280
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot, and you haven't got a clue.

2195
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:38,300
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

2196
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:39,640
Out of you.

2197
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:47,520
I'm never gonna catch my breath, single by those who knew me.

2198
02:39:47,880 --> 02:39:50,540
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym.

2199
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:52,000
Shut the hell up, this is my part!

2200
02:39:52,380 --> 02:39:54,160
This guy's got him scared to death.

2201
02:39:54,340 --> 02:39:56,020
Hope he doesn't see right through me.

2202
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:59,100
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim.

2203
02:39:59,740 --> 02:40:00,880
Be a man.

2204
02:40:01,060 --> 02:40:04,140
We must be swift as the coursing rhythm.

2205
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:05,160
Be a man.

2206
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:07,510
With all the force of great time.

2207
02:40:07,510 --> 02:40:09,390
Be a man.

2208
02:40:09,450 --> 02:40:12,650
With all the strength of a raging fire.

2209
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:17,950
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

2210
02:40:21,390 --> 02:40:28,290
Time is racing toward us, till the Huns arrive.

2211
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:35,530
Heed my every order, and you might survive.

2212
02:40:36,730 --> 02:40:37,470
Survive.

2213
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:42,090
You're unsuited for the rage of war.

2214
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:45,130
So pack up, go home, you're through.

2215
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:47,650
How could I?

2216
02:40:54,060 --> 02:40:55,490
Be a man.

2217
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:58,980
We must be swift as the coursing rhythm.

2218
02:40:59,140 --> 02:40:59,920
Be a man.

2219
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:02,620
With all the force of a great time.

2220
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:04,140
Be a man.

2221
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:07,460
With all the strength of a raging fire.

2222
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:11,200
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

2223
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:19,960
We must be swift as the coursing river.

2224
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:24,200
With all the force of a great typhoon.

2225
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:28,540
With all the strength of a raging fire.

2226
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:33,960
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

2227
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:35,700
Yeah!

2228
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:39,920
Oh no, I started to dance again.

2229
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:40,740
Oh no!

2230
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:46,640
I couldn't see who rated me because I think YouTube glitched it like...

2231
02:41:46,640 --> 02:41:48,960
Only showed like a white bar at the top.

2232
02:41:49,060 --> 02:41:51,440
So, thank you whoever rated, thank you!

2233
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,760
Um, hold on, I need a drink of water.

2234
02:41:58,440 --> 02:41:59,280
The moon!

2235
02:42:02,770 --> 02:42:04,270
Okay, that was so fun.

2236
02:42:07,010 --> 02:42:09,330
Oh, I just wanna sing and dance now.

2237
02:42:10,710 --> 02:42:13,490
Um, I'll make a man out of you!

2238
02:42:14,950 --> 02:42:16,830
Actually, there's another song that I wanna do.

2239
02:42:17,290 --> 02:42:19,490
But I always fuck up the last part.

2240
02:42:19,650 --> 02:42:20,110
Oh, sorry.

2241
02:42:20,290 --> 02:42:21,890
I always mess up the last part.

2242
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:22,730
Dancing Queen!

2243
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:25,250
Oh my god, wait, actually I'll do that instead.

2244
02:42:25,350 --> 02:42:26,290
You're so smart!

2245
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:28,770
Oh my gosh, you're so smart!

2246
02:42:28,910 --> 02:42:29,830
You're so smart!

2247
02:42:30,210 --> 02:42:31,390
You're so smart!

2248
02:42:32,050 --> 02:42:33,270
Twilight by ELO?

2249
02:42:33,310 --> 02:42:34,090
Okay, I'll sing that after.

2250
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:37,830
oh

2251
02:42:53,690 --> 02:42:54,530
my gosh.

2252
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:58,090
You can dance, you can...

2253
02:42:58,670 --> 02:42:59,430
...jazzing

2254
02:43:09,630 --> 02:43:09,930
queen!

2255
02:43:11,750 --> 02:43:12,590
Yay!

2256
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:33,760
You've got to look for a king.

2257
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:34,100
I'm

2258
02:43:43,050 --> 02:43:44,790
young and the music's high.

2259
02:43:46,250 --> 02:43:49,570
With a bit of rock music, everything's...

2260
02:43:55,030 --> 02:44:02,390
And when you get the chance, you are the dancing queen!

2261
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:04,370
You are the dancing queen!

2262
02:44:04,370 --> 02:44:06,790
I can't sleep forever, 17.

2263
02:44:10,130 --> 02:44:11,870
Dancing queen.

2264
02:44:12,490 --> 02:44:16,890
Feel the beat from the tambourine.

2265
02:44:16,910 --> 02:44:18,110
Oh yeah.

2266
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:31,040
See that ghost.

2267
02:44:31,880 --> 02:44:33,300
Watch that scene.

2268
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:35,680
Diggin' the dancing queen.

2269
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:39,860
You're

2270
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:04,480
in the mood for a dance.

2271
02:45:05,850 --> 02:45:09,630
And when you get the chance.

2272
02:45:10,570 --> 02:45:13,770
You are the dancing queen.

2273
02:45:14,390 --> 02:45:16,070
Young and sweet.

2274
02:45:16,270 --> 02:45:18,230
Forever 17.

2275
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:23,250
Dancing queen.

2276
02:45:24,010 --> 02:45:28,270
Feel the beat from the tambourine.

2277
02:45:28,270 --> 02:45:29,490
Oh yeah.

2278
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:44,620
Watch that scene.

2279
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:47,040
Diggin' the dancing queen.

2280
02:46:27,570 --> 02:46:30,290
I feel like I needed that baby video again.

2281
02:46:31,150 --> 02:46:32,470
Hold on, I'm going to pull it up.

2282
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:34,610
I'm going to pull up the baby.

2283
02:46:34,690 --> 02:46:35,390
Hold on, where is it?

2284
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:38,090
Where did I put it?

2285
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:43,320
Baby video.

2286
02:46:50,860 --> 02:46:51,500
That's me.

2287
02:46:55,910 --> 02:46:58,290
Someone requested Twilight by ELO.

2288
02:46:58,290 --> 02:46:58,590
Okay.

2289
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:00,050
This is me.

2290
02:47:01,450 --> 02:47:03,090
Dancing to Twilight by ELO.

2291
02:47:03,270 --> 02:47:03,510
Dancing to Twilight by ELO.

2292
02:47:05,950 --> 02:47:07,250
Um, there it is.

2293
02:47:07,410 --> 02:47:08,950
I think I need to put this one...

2294
02:47:08,950 --> 02:47:10,610
No, I'll just sing it out the regular key.

2295
02:47:12,990 --> 02:47:14,050
Do Linkin Park?

2296
02:47:14,250 --> 02:47:15,610
Oh my gosh, I'll do Linkin Park after.

2297
02:47:15,990 --> 02:47:17,030
This is a good idea.

2298
02:47:27,990 --> 02:47:31,350
The vision's dancing in my mind.

2299
02:47:31,450 --> 02:47:34,570
The early dawn, the shades of time.

2300
02:47:35,390 --> 02:47:38,250
Twilight's crawling through my window.

2301
02:47:38,250 --> 02:47:38,810
No pain.

2302
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:44,810
Am I awake or do I dream?

2303
02:47:45,070 --> 02:47:48,390
The strangest pictures I have seen.

2304
02:47:48,630 --> 02:47:52,430
Night is day and Twilight's gone away.

2305
02:47:54,070 --> 02:47:57,790
With your head held high and your silence large.

2306
02:47:58,030 --> 02:48:01,130
You can do what you mean from the open skies.

2307
02:48:01,470 --> 02:48:03,430
It's either real or it's a dream.

2308
02:48:03,490 --> 02:48:05,010
There's nothing that is in between.

2309
02:48:05,570 --> 02:48:06,250
Twilight.

2310
02:48:06,250 --> 02:48:11,150
I only meant to stay a while.

2311
02:48:12,030 --> 02:48:12,910
Twilight.

2312
02:48:14,090 --> 02:48:15,970
I gave you time.

2313
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:17,690
To steal my mind.

2314
02:48:17,950 --> 02:48:18,390
Away

2315
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:29,580
your face.

2316
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:32,920
You disappeared without a trace.

2317
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:37,240
You brought me here but can you take me back?

2318
02:48:39,820 --> 02:48:43,260
Inside the image of your light.

2319
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:46,520
That now is day and once was night.

2320
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:02,600
And this is the second one.

2321
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:11,550
And this is the third

2322
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:45,400
one.

2323
02:50:44,990 --> 02:50:46,770
This ending always toss me off.

2324
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:49,050
I just turned around and was like... is something behind me?

2325
02:50:52,970 --> 02:50:55,650
The ending is so jarring...

2326
02:50:56,330 --> 02:50:57,810
Yay, that was Twilight!

2327
02:51:02,990 --> 02:51:04,790
Thank you for your energy...

2328
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:05,470
Yeah!

2329
02:51:06,590 --> 02:51:07,810
I'll sing a few more songs.

2330
02:51:08,330 --> 02:51:09,490
Someone said Linkin Park.

2331
02:51:12,310 --> 02:51:15,410
Oh my gosh, now I'm like, oh no, I'm going to get into the emo song mood.

2332
02:51:17,850 --> 02:51:19,610
I know this stream is never going to end.

2333
02:51:21,910 --> 02:51:24,570
I'm going to do my favorite Linkin Park song, so I hope you don't mind.

2334
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:29,790
I don't think I'll even be able to sing it well, but...

2335
02:51:54,130 --> 02:51:57,350
Like opening the wound up,

2336
02:52:00,740 --> 02:52:44,160
you all assume I'm safe here in my room, unless I try to start again I don't want to be the one the battles always choose Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused I don't know what's worth fighting for, why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate Say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habits I'm breaking the habits Tonight!

2337
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:48,360
Where's the anime background?

2338
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:49,020
I'm right here!

2339
02:52:49,860 --> 02:52:56,480
Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath

2340
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:29,460
I'm getting my memories right The only reason I don't want to be on the living room Is to leave this place Because I know I'm going to have to stop Why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate Say what I don't mean I don't know how to get away I don't know how I got this way.

2341
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:30,980
I'll never be alright.

2342
02:53:31,360 --> 02:53:35,960
So I'm breaking my habits.

2343
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:38,060
I'm ready to

2344
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:09,540
show you what I mean.

2345
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:12,620
I don't know how I got this way.

2346
02:54:12,740 --> 02:54:14,220
I'll never be alright.

2347
02:54:14,400 --> 02:54:15,800
So I'm breaking...

2348
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:46,140
This song is so awesome.

2349
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:49,020
Yay!

2350
02:54:50,180 --> 02:54:52,400
That was Breaking the Habit.

2351
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:54,780
From Linkin Park.

2352
02:54:56,300 --> 02:54:56,920
Let's see.

2353
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:05,320
I feel like I sang like the Kidz Bop version of it though.

2354
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:09,060
I feel like I sang the Kidz Bop version of it.

2355
02:55:09,160 --> 02:55:11,280
I'm like, I'll break it on the wall!

2356
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:13,120
Or I'll paint it on the wall!

2357
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:21,320
Lilium.

2358
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:22,420
I don't know Latin.

2359
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:25,740
Is it even on here?

2360
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:26,100
Let's see.

2361
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:31,440
Not on here.

2362
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:34,200
I saw some people say Fleetwood Mac.

2363
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,380
I don't remember which...

2364
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:49,780
I'll try.

2365
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:52,720
Um...

2366
02:55:56,520 --> 02:55:57,760
Let Biscuit break stuff.

2367
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:58,580
I'm getting there!

2368
02:55:58,720 --> 02:55:59,280
I'm getting there!

2369
02:55:59,540 --> 02:55:59,940
Gosh!

2370
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:02,560
I'm getting there!

2371
02:56:02,620 --> 02:56:03,100
I'm getting there!

2372
02:56:03,140 --> 02:56:03,660
I'm getting there!

2373
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:12,080
Maybe this one.

2374
02:56:16,720 --> 02:56:17,820
It's totally different.

2375
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:19,180
You know what?

2376
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:21,100
This is all whiplash so it's fine, right?

2377
02:56:22,780 --> 02:56:24,260
This is all whiplash.

2378
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:26,540
Oh, I forgot to add the dancing queen.

2379
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:26,980
Thank you.

2380
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:38,250
Oh, she's beautiful.

2381
02:56:38,250 --> 02:56:40,110
Oh, I forgot to add the dancing queen.

2382
02:56:40,110 --> 02:56:40,390
Thank you.

2383
02:56:40,390 --> 02:56:40,510
This one is called Oh My Gosh.

2384
02:56:41,210 --> 02:56:52,170
And I saw my reflection on the snow-covered hills, till the landslide brought me down.

2385
02:56:53,730 --> 02:56:58,030
Oh mirror in the sky, what is love?

2386
02:56:59,370 --> 02:57:04,010
Can the child within my heart rise above?

2387
02:57:04,290 --> 02:57:04,650
No, it's all about love.

2388
02:57:04,670 --> 02:57:11,810
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?

2389
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:18,250
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

2390
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:52,020
Afraid of changing cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder, even children get older I'm getting older too

2391
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:58,440
This is not the one I meant to pick.

2392
02:57:58,820 --> 02:58:00,540
Cause I don't know it as well.

2393
02:58:00,760 --> 02:58:01,940
But that's okay.

2394
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:40,040
Afraid of changing cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder, even children get older I'm getting older too

2395
02:58:59,650 --> 02:59:34,370
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills Well, the landslide brings me down If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills Well, the landslide brings me down Oh, the landslide brings me down Hopefully I did it okay.

2396
02:59:35,590 --> 02:59:37,230
Hopefully I did that okay.

2397
02:59:38,310 --> 02:59:39,310
Yeah, but...

2398
02:59:41,010 --> 02:59:41,650
Landslide...

2399
02:59:44,110 --> 02:59:46,550
Gonna have to start scooting things up a little bit.

2400
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:49,470
Yay.

2401
03:00:02,200 --> 03:00:02,960
Feels great?

2402
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:03,700
Thank you.

2403
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:05,920
Thank you for the claps, everybody.

2404
03:00:06,040 --> 03:00:06,460
Thank you.

2405
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:08,640
I appreciate it.

2406
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:09,220
Thank you.

2407
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:11,380
Thank you.

2408
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:13,640
Shut up and dance?

2409
03:00:14,580 --> 03:00:15,820
I always end dancing.

2410
03:00:16,060 --> 03:00:17,740
Bravo brings tears to my boomer eyes.

2411
03:00:17,820 --> 03:00:18,280
That was beautiful.

2412
03:00:20,620 --> 03:00:23,540
Thank you for donating mid-song.

2413
03:00:23,940 --> 03:00:24,800
How dare you.

2414
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:25,300
No, I'm just kidding.

2415
03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:26,780
Don't worry about it.

2416
03:00:26,780 --> 03:00:27,500
I'm sad now.

2417
03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:28,200
Don't be sad.

2418
03:00:30,220 --> 03:00:30,960
Here's another one.

2419
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:32,220
I'm probably gonna botch this one too.

2420
03:00:36,970 --> 03:00:39,010
Actually, I'm debating whether I want to sing it or not.

2421
03:00:39,570 --> 03:00:42,050
I think I'm gonna do three more...

2422
03:00:42,050 --> 03:00:43,170
I'm gonna go to 35.

2423
03:00:44,870 --> 03:00:45,230
So...

2424
03:00:49,150 --> 03:00:49,870
Thank you.

2425
03:00:50,110 --> 03:00:50,310
Thank you.

2426
03:00:50,390 --> 03:00:51,410
What about I'm Still Standing?

2427
03:00:51,810 --> 03:00:52,850
Oh, I like that one.

2428
03:00:53,070 --> 03:00:53,390
You know what?

2429
03:00:53,530 --> 03:00:54,990
I'm still standing...

2430
03:00:54,990 --> 03:00:55,870
Oh, I wrote sanding.

2431
03:00:58,530 --> 03:00:59,630
I'm really glad you did, Lansai.

2432
03:00:59,710 --> 03:01:01,450
I'm going to suggest it and it turned out beautifully.

2433
03:01:01,610 --> 03:01:02,270
Oh, thank you.

2434
03:01:03,630 --> 03:01:04,770
Is that Elton John?

2435
03:01:06,930 --> 03:01:09,010
Oh, I needed more water after this.

2436
03:01:12,390 --> 03:01:12,850
Oh.

2437
03:01:37,570 --> 03:01:39,030
So it never would.

2438
03:01:39,230 --> 03:01:40,110
Well, look at me.

2439
03:01:40,130 --> 03:01:41,730
I'm coming back again.

2440
03:01:41,830 --> 03:01:42,310
I got it.

2441
03:04:12,420 --> 03:04:12,880
Yeah.

2442
03:04:14,260 --> 03:04:15,600
I'm still standing.

2443
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:17,120
I actually am still standing.

2444
03:04:18,120 --> 03:04:18,580
I'm...

2445
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:21,000
I put my desk up, but I've been standing this whole time.

2446
03:04:21,140 --> 03:04:23,120
I've been standing since...

2447
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:25,360
DuckTales!

2448
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:26,160
No.

2449
03:04:28,340 --> 03:04:28,620
Yes?

2450
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:30,120
I don't know.

2451
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:31,700
About... about then.

2452
03:04:33,360 --> 03:04:35,020
I'm still standing.

2453
03:04:35,860 --> 03:04:37,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2454
03:04:37,480 --> 03:04:39,140
Some people are requesting Ghost.

2455
03:04:40,120 --> 03:04:41,400
I'll be honest.

2456
03:04:41,580 --> 03:04:42,540
Mariana Cross...

2457
03:04:43,400 --> 03:04:44,440
is like...

2458
03:04:44,440 --> 03:04:45,300
Call Me A Poser.

2459
03:04:45,780 --> 03:04:47,700
It's like one of the only songs that...

2460
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:49,020
I've listened to a couple of their songs.

2461
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:49,880
But it's only...

2462
03:04:49,880 --> 03:04:51,480
Probably the only one that I can sing so well.

2463
03:04:52,120 --> 03:04:53,280
Actually, I'll be right back.

2464
03:04:53,360 --> 03:04:54,160
I'm gonna go get some water.

2465
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:55,600
Like super duper fast.

2466
03:04:56,420 --> 03:04:57,260
Super duper quick.

2467
03:04:57,440 --> 03:04:57,840
I'm like...

2468
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:59,860
When I say it's quick, I'm gonna be like quick, quick.

2469
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:00,260
So...

2470
03:05:00,840 --> 03:05:01,200
Don't...

2471
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:02,160
Don't go anywhere.

2472
03:05:41,730 --> 03:05:43,030
Why are you guys crying?

2473
03:05:44,350 --> 03:05:45,810
I told you I was getting water.

2474
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:48,290
Why are you guys crying?

2475
03:05:48,790 --> 03:05:49,510
What happened?

2476
03:05:50,110 --> 03:05:50,950
Why are you crying?

2477
03:05:55,010 --> 03:05:55,410
I'm crying!

2478
03:05:55,410 --> 03:05:55,770
Mmm.

2479
03:05:59,980 --> 03:06:01,000
Why are you crying?

2480
03:06:05,300 --> 03:06:06,940
Someone said, so no Snake Eater?

2481
03:06:07,360 --> 03:06:07,980
I don't know.

2482
03:06:08,040 --> 03:06:09,000
I have 3 songs left?

2483
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:09,560
What are you talking about?

2484
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:12,340
I have several songs left.

2485
03:06:12,940 --> 03:06:14,060
I have songs left.

2486
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:14,520
Okay?

2487
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:15,860
Oh my gosh.

2488
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:17,220
I need to get ready for tomorrow.

2489
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:19,760
Wait, I need to get ready for this weekend.

2490
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:20,440
Oh, shoot.

2491
03:06:20,620 --> 03:06:21,360
Oh shoot.

2492
03:06:21,360 --> 03:06:22,500
Okay, I just noticed the time.

2493
03:06:23,620 --> 03:06:24,020
Okay.

2494
03:06:25,640 --> 03:06:26,040
Okay.

2495
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:27,460
I have...

2496
03:06:28,460 --> 03:06:29,500
Wait, two songs left.

2497
03:06:29,740 --> 03:06:31,420
I can do three if I feel like it.

2498
03:06:33,280 --> 03:06:34,800
Okay, let's do Snake Eater now then.

2499
03:06:43,580 --> 03:06:44,380
Well, I

2500
03:06:49,490 --> 03:06:52,490
have to find the one that is good.

2501
03:07:29,320 --> 03:07:30,720
Okay.

2502
03:07:58,320 --> 03:07:59,280
Okay.

2503
03:08:37,460 --> 03:08:38,860
Okay,

2504
03:08:52,280 --> 03:09:04,080
let's do Snake Eater.

2505
03:09:04,100 --> 03:09:06,320
Okay,

2506
03:09:26,820 --> 03:09:40,440
let's do Snake Eater now then.

2507
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:42,080
Snake Eater

2508
03:09:46,660 --> 03:09:58,640
I'm still in a dream Snake Eater

2509
03:10:08,970 --> 03:10:14,290
Snake Eater Thank you, Andy Murray for your karaoke.

2510
03:10:15,430 --> 03:10:17,810
Oh, sorry.

2511
03:10:17,890 --> 03:10:19,070
The Phantom X.

2512
03:10:19,350 --> 03:10:20,230
Oh, perfect.

2513
03:10:20,490 --> 03:10:20,950
You're a phantom.

2514
03:10:20,970 --> 03:10:21,450
You're a phantom too.

2515
03:10:28,360 --> 03:10:28,840
Snake...

2516
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:30,480
Snake Eater.

2517
03:10:31,900 --> 03:10:32,860
Snake Eater.

2518
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:34,760
Okay.

2519
03:10:35,540 --> 03:10:37,560
I know what the next three songs will be.

2520
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:52,840
Thank you guys for the super chats.

2521
03:10:52,960 --> 03:10:54,640
Oh my gosh, YouTube is like really breaking.

2522
03:10:55,160 --> 03:10:55,840
Holy cow.

2523
03:10:57,060 --> 03:10:57,840
Oh my gosh.

2524
03:10:58,460 --> 03:10:59,940
I can't see anything.

2525
03:11:00,080 --> 03:11:00,280
Wait.

2526
03:11:01,940 --> 03:11:02,420
Oh.

2527
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:03,120
Hold on.

2528
03:11:03,860 --> 03:11:04,740
Everything is breaking.

2529
03:11:05,640 --> 03:11:06,120
No.

2530
03:11:06,920 --> 03:11:08,000
Don't break, please.

2531
03:11:13,500 --> 03:11:15,020
Thank you for the Akasupa.

2532
03:11:15,340 --> 03:11:16,040
Slade once again.

2533
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:17,020
Thank you.

2534
03:11:17,380 --> 03:11:17,940
Thank you.

2535
03:11:17,960 --> 03:11:18,380
Thank you.

2536
03:11:19,460 --> 03:11:20,620
Thank you so much.

2537
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:20,940
Thank you.

2538
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:21,240
Thank you.

2539
03:11:21,260 --> 03:11:21,540
Thank you.

2540
03:11:22,020 --> 03:11:22,800
Oh my gosh.

2541
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:25,260
Never get tired of hearing you singing that.

2542
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:25,680
I'm glad.

2543
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:29,100
I'll never get tired of singing it.

2544
03:11:39,130 --> 03:11:41,570
I don't know if I'm going to be able to sing this next one.

2545
03:11:42,190 --> 03:11:44,230
Because I think my throat is already borked.

2546
03:11:46,410 --> 03:11:46,730
And...

2547
03:11:49,710 --> 03:11:52,090
Do you want me to send you the kazoo instrumental when I'm done?

2548
03:11:52,530 --> 03:11:53,010
Oh my gosh.

2549
03:11:53,110 --> 03:11:53,310
Yes.

2550
03:11:55,270 --> 03:11:55,910
Of course.

2551
03:11:55,930 --> 03:11:56,490
Break it more.

2552
03:11:56,550 --> 03:11:56,930
Don't worry.

2553
03:11:57,030 --> 03:11:57,970
Break is happening.

2554
03:11:58,110 --> 03:11:58,470
But you know what?

2555
03:11:59,250 --> 03:12:01,450
I'm going to sing this anyway because I like this song.

2556
03:12:04,230 --> 03:12:04,850
Actually, hold on.

2557
03:12:04,930 --> 03:12:05,150
Wait.

2558
03:12:05,250 --> 03:12:05,510
Wait.

2559
03:12:05,710 --> 03:12:05,710
Wait.

2560
03:12:06,170 --> 03:12:07,110
I don't want to do it here.

2561
03:12:08,070 --> 03:12:08,390
Wait.

2562
03:12:08,430 --> 03:12:08,750
Wait.

2563
03:12:08,750 --> 03:12:09,490
Wait.

2564
03:12:11,650 --> 03:12:16,270
There was actually a version I saw that said it had some special stuff.

2565
03:12:16,510 --> 03:12:16,830
Hold on.

2566
03:12:18,430 --> 03:12:18,950
Hold on.

2567
03:12:18,990 --> 03:12:19,190
Sorry.

2568
03:12:19,910 --> 03:12:23,330
You can just pretend it's playing, right?

2569
03:12:23,470 --> 03:12:24,530
You can just be like, yeah.

2570
03:12:25,190 --> 03:12:25,590
Yeah.

2571
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:26,030
Yeah.

2572
03:12:31,820 --> 03:12:32,220
Okay.

2573
03:12:33,220 --> 03:12:33,780
Hold on.

2574
03:12:33,800 --> 03:12:34,640
Let me check this real quick.

2575
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:44,480
Oh.

2576
03:12:48,440 --> 03:12:48,840
Oh.

2577
03:12:48,900 --> 03:12:49,720
It sounds like poo poo.

2578
03:12:49,840 --> 03:12:50,040
Okay.

2579
03:12:50,060 --> 03:12:50,440
Never mind.

2580
03:12:50,540 --> 03:12:51,320
I'm going to do this version.

2581
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:53,480
Okay.

2582
03:13:49,560 --> 03:13:51,660
To sound… Just is What?

2583
03:13:52,160 --> 03:13:52,400
What?

2584
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:54,140
It Was It What?

2585
03:14:27,450 --> 03:14:36,530
Mary on a cross, if you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally.

2586
03:14:37,370 --> 03:14:42,290
And I see nothing wrong with that.

2587
03:14:58,710 --> 03:15:03,210
We were searching for reasons to play by the rules.

2588
03:15:05,690 --> 03:15:10,470
But we quickly found out it was just for fools.

2589
03:15:13,240 --> 03:15:17,840
Not for all the sorrow, we'll be riding high.

2590
03:15:20,720 --> 03:15:27,160
And the truth of the matter is, I'll never let you go, let you go.

2591
03:15:35,590 --> 03:15:38,990
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2592
03:15:39,530 --> 03:15:43,630
Mary on a, Mary on a cross.

2593
03:15:44,390 --> 03:15:46,790
Not just another bloody Mary.

2594
03:15:47,770 --> 03:15:50,950
Mary on a, Mary on a cross.

2595
03:15:50,970 --> 03:15:54,320
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2596
03:15:54,810 --> 03:15:58,530
Mary on a, Mary on a cross.

2597
03:15:59,110 --> 03:16:02,090
Your beauty never ever scared me.

2598
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:06,010
Mary on a, Mary on a cross.

2599
03:16:06,710 --> 03:16:13,490
If you choose to run away with me, I will tickle you internally.

2600
03:16:14,740 --> 03:16:19,310
And I see nothing wrong with that.

2601
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:01,620
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2602
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:02,360
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2603
03:17:02,360 --> 03:17:03,700
Mary on a cross.

2604
03:17:04,040 --> 03:17:06,220
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2605
03:17:06,240 --> 03:17:08,980
Mary on a cross.

2606
03:17:08,980 --> 03:17:13,060
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2607
03:17:13,060 --> 03:17:13,560
Mary on a cross.

2608
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:14,140
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2609
03:17:15,560 --> 03:17:15,560
Mary

2610
03:17:26,430 --> 03:17:27,010
on a cross.

2611
03:17:27,010 --> 03:17:29,630
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2612
03:17:29,990 --> 03:17:30,650
Mary on a cross.

2613
03:17:30,650 --> 03:17:31,530
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2614
03:17:31,710 --> 03:17:32,010
Mary on a cross.

2615
03:17:32,010 --> 03:17:33,550
You go down just like Holy Mary.

2616
03:17:33,550 --> 03:18:05,970
I don't know why, but you wanna justify RIPPING SOMEONE THAT OFF No human contact, and if you interact Your life is on contract Your best bet is to STAY AWAY MOTHERFUCKER It's just one of those days It's all about the he says she says Bullshit I think you better quit Let shit slip Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip It's all about the he says she says Bullshit I think you better quit Talk of that shit It's just one of those days Feeling like a freight train First ones hit the plane,

Hang on, across...

03:20:23,990 --> 03:20:24,950
Break stuff...

2624
03:20:24,950 --> 03:20:26,650
And now the last...

2625
03:20:27,410 --> 03:20:29,310
Last... last... last song.

2626
03:20:29,590 --> 03:20:31,270
I accidentally hit my mic.

2627
03:20:31,510 --> 03:20:32,450
When I was...

2628
03:20:33,130 --> 03:20:35,230
When I was like, headbanging.

2629
03:20:36,330 --> 03:20:36,810
Oopsie.

2630
03:20:41,210 --> 03:20:43,310
Well thanks for being here for my karaoke everybody.

2631
03:20:43,570 --> 03:20:44,630
I have one last song.

2632
03:20:44,630 --> 03:20:45,530
And...

2633
03:20:46,630 --> 03:20:48,570
I hope you liked Break Stuff.

2634
03:20:48,670 --> 03:20:50,790
I know people have been asking for it a lot for some reason.

2635
03:20:52,110 --> 03:20:52,570
But...

2636
03:20:55,710 --> 03:20:56,970
I hope it...

2637
03:20:56,970 --> 03:20:58,010
I hope it...

2638
03:20:59,090 --> 03:21:00,130
I hope it...

2639
03:21:00,990 --> 03:21:02,630
Was your expectations...

2640
03:21:03,230 --> 03:21:04,330
Wait, I hope it...

2641
03:21:05,310 --> 03:21:06,350
I hope it...

2642
03:21:06,350 --> 03:21:07,610
Lived up to your expectations.

2643
03:21:08,490 --> 03:21:10,250
You went kind of crazy with that one.

2644
03:21:14,830 --> 03:21:16,030
It's such a good...

2645
03:21:16,590 --> 03:21:18,770
Song to just let it all out.

2646
03:21:18,850 --> 03:21:19,150
You know?

2647
03:21:21,590 --> 03:21:22,290
You know?

2648
03:21:22,830 --> 03:21:24,350
Yeah, thanks for the gift.

2649
03:21:24,350 --> 03:21:25,770
You guys, thank you for the...

2650
03:21:26,610 --> 03:21:28,510
Thank you for the donuts.

2651
03:21:28,690 --> 03:21:29,410
Thank you for the super chats.

2652
03:21:29,510 --> 03:21:30,430
I really appreciate it.

2653
03:21:31,070 --> 03:21:31,750
Thank you.

2654
03:21:33,130 --> 03:21:33,670
Hold on.

2655
03:21:38,150 --> 03:21:39,610
I'm afraid of how that sounded.

2656
03:21:39,630 --> 03:21:40,990
To be honest, but...

2657
03:21:42,210 --> 03:21:43,690
I'm afraid of how that sounded.

2658
03:21:44,030 --> 03:21:44,830
I'm just...

2659
03:21:44,830 --> 03:21:47,510
Sometimes I listen back on my karaoke to see like...

2660
03:21:47,630 --> 03:21:49,450
Oh, I should adjust this.

2661
03:21:49,510 --> 03:21:50,230
Or change that.

2662
03:21:50,410 --> 03:21:50,990
Or whatever, whatever.

2663
03:21:51,810 --> 03:21:53,570
I don't think I'm gonna listen back...

2664
03:21:53,570 --> 03:21:54,790
To this one.

2665
03:21:55,110 --> 03:21:59,610
I don't think I'm gonna listen back to this one.

2666
03:21:59,870 --> 03:22:00,250
Okay.

2667
03:22:01,190 --> 03:22:03,050
Actually, that's 35 songs.

2668
03:22:04,350 --> 03:22:05,890
Maybe we should keep it at 35.

2669
03:22:06,430 --> 03:22:06,690
Maybe we should keep it at 35.

2670
03:22:06,930 --> 03:22:08,110
An even number.

2671
03:22:08,870 --> 03:22:10,130
Not even, but you know.

2672
03:22:10,210 --> 03:22:10,910
A clean number.

2673
03:22:11,130 --> 03:22:12,230
A clean number.

2674
03:22:16,500 --> 03:22:18,440
Just wait until you see me...

2675
03:22:19,340 --> 03:22:21,120
Sing that song in 3D.

2676
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:22,620
I think...

2677
03:22:22,620 --> 03:22:24,900
I think...

2678
03:22:25,460 --> 03:22:26,640
It might be...

2679
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:27,700
You know...

2680
03:22:30,880 --> 03:22:33,000
It might be really funny to watch.

2681
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:36,580
Oh, man.

2682
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:40,220
So... Oh!

2683
03:22:40,240 --> 03:22:41,160
My chat just broke.

2684
03:22:41,560 --> 03:22:42,080
Okay.

2685
03:22:42,940 --> 03:22:44,680
What you got against 36, huh?

2686
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:46,880
Okay.

2687
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:47,420
Fine.

2688
03:22:47,660 --> 03:22:48,600
I guess we'll just do it.

2689
03:22:49,100 --> 03:22:50,420
Even though my throat hurts a little bit.

2690
03:22:50,840 --> 03:22:51,580
What?

2691
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:52,400
My throat hurts?

2692
03:22:52,400 --> 03:22:53,060
That'd be crazy.

2693
03:22:53,440 --> 03:22:53,780
No!

2694
03:22:53,960 --> 03:22:54,960
I can keep going!

2695
03:22:55,440 --> 03:22:57,060
I can keep going!

2696
03:23:01,860 --> 03:23:03,640
The emo anthem...

2697
03:23:03,640 --> 03:23:05,140
Has begun!

2698
03:23:06,320 --> 03:23:57,150
When I was a young ghost My father Took me into the city To see A marching band He said Son, when You grow up Would you be The savior of the broken The beaten And the damned He said Will you defeat them Your demons And all the non-believers The plans That they have made Because One day I'll leave you Mint phantom To lead you in the summer To join the Black Parade

2699
03:24:01,690 --> 03:24:03,010
I feel

2700
03:25:00,540 --> 03:25:09,580
like I should go And through it all To rise upon The bodies in the streets And when you're

2701
03:25:34,180 --> 03:25:37,700
listened to Reeling from decimated dreams

2702
03:27:54,980 --> 03:27:56,560
I salute to you all.

2703
03:27:57,140 --> 03:27:58,480
Thank you for watching!

2704
03:27:59,840 --> 03:28:01,620
Thank you for hanging out with me!

2705
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:03,300
I'll see you guys in a couple of days!

2706
03:28:04,060 --> 03:28:05,500
But thank you for listening!

2707
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:07,000
Thank you!

2708
03:28:07,100 --> 03:28:07,640
Thank you!

2709
03:28:07,640 --> 03:28:08,220
Thank you!

2710
03:28:08,280 --> 03:28:08,720
Bye!

2711
03:28:13,200 --> 03:28:14,560
I need a shower!

2712
03:28:23,620 --> 03:28:24,500
Thank you!

2713
03:28:24,540 --> 03:28:24,820
Thank you!

2714
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:25,140
Thank you!

2715
03:28:25,760 --> 03:28:26,620
Bye-bye!

2716
03:28:29,220 --> 03:28:29,660
Bye-bye!

2717
03:28:29,660 --> 03:28:30,380
Oh, how do I...

2718
03:28:30,380 --> 03:28:31,360
Oh, there we go.

2719
03:28:42,420 --> 03:28:44,040
My chat is so broken.

2720
03:28:44,440 --> 03:28:45,440
I'm refreshing.

2721
03:28:46,140 --> 03:28:47,840
I didn't even see what you guys were...

2722
03:28:49,780 --> 03:28:50,660
Thank you!

2723
03:28:51,120 --> 03:28:52,700
Oh my gosh, thank you so much!

2724
03:28:52,760 --> 03:28:53,600
Thank you guys!

2725
03:28:53,780 --> 03:28:54,600
See you later!

2726
03:28:56,920 --> 03:28:57,560
Bye-bye!

2727
03:28:58,480 --> 03:29:00,080
Oh my gosh, I didn't even say bye-bye.

2728
03:29:00,180 --> 03:29:01,380
Valentine, thank you for the $50 gift!

2729
03:29:01,700 --> 03:29:03,480
David Steele, thank you for the $50 gift!

2730
03:29:03,740 --> 03:29:06,260
Oh my gosh, Valentine, thank you for...

2731
03:29:06,260 --> 03:29:07,860
I think I said it earlier.

2732
03:29:08,700 --> 03:29:09,580
Bye-bye!

2733
03:29:10,460 --> 03:29:11,880
Sorry, I'm just...

2734
03:29:11,880 --> 03:29:12,680
Bye-bye!

2735
03:29:13,240 --> 03:29:13,980
Bye-bye!

2736
03:29:14,820 --> 03:29:15,080
Wait!

2737
03:29:15,080 --> 03:29:15,240
Wait!

2738
03:29:26,980 --> 03:29:28,640
I love your voice so much!

2739
03:29:28,740 --> 03:29:29,600
You make my day so happy!

2740
03:29:29,640 --> 03:29:30,180
Thank you!

2741
03:29:31,740 --> 03:29:32,320
Thank you!

2742
03:29:32,380 --> 03:29:32,780
Thank you!

2743
03:29:32,800 --> 03:29:36,380
I always end up doing Welcome to the Black Parade.

2744
03:29:36,740 --> 03:29:37,880
I'm like...

2745
03:29:37,880 --> 03:29:39,260
My voice is just so...

2746
03:29:41,580 --> 03:29:41,960
But,

2747
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:49,760
way of saying, I just shouldn't...

2748
03:29:49,760 --> 03:29:50,900
Oh my god, I can't even...

2749
03:29:50,900 --> 03:29:52,280
Oh no, I can't even end the stream!

2750
03:29:52,820 --> 03:29:53,200
Uh-oh.

2751
03:29:53,220 --> 03:29:53,760
Wait, hold on.

2752
03:29:54,080 --> 03:29:54,680
Uh-oh.

2753
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:58,560
YouTube is broken!

2754
03:30:19,410 --> 03:30:20,370
Forever stream now!

2755
03:30:21,010 --> 03:30:21,290
Okay.

2756
03:30:21,530 --> 03:30:22,470
Thank you, guys!

2757
03:30:22,650 --> 03:30:23,690
Oh, Rick, thank you for the $50!

2758
03:30:24,030 --> 03:30:24,590

2759
03:30:24,970 --> 03:30:25,670

2764
