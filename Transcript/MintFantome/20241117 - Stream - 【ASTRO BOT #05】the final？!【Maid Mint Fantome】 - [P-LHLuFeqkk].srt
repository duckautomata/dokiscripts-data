1
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,730
Minky!

2
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,710
Minky!

3
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,250
Minky!

4
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,750
Minky!

5
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,910
Minky!

6
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,930
Welcome back, master and miss!

7
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,510
Hello, hello, hello.

8
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:54,670
Hello.

9
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,790
Hello, hello, hello.

10
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,050
Hi.

11
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,190
Hi.

12
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,390
Welcome, everybody.

13
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,590
Oh my goodness.

14
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,490
I'm back!

15
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,990
What was I gonna say?

16
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,590
How's the coffee?

17
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,230
It's good!

18
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,170
It's very good.

19
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,990
Oh my gosh, I was feeling so fine today.

20
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,190
Then I have dinner and now I just feel so icky.

21
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,750
So I apologize.

22
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,750
I think I'll feel better eventually.

23
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,970
I like...

24
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,490
Are you eepy?

25
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,310
I'm a little eepy.

26
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,270
But...

27
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,150
I found out recently...

28
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,290
I found out recently that I...

29
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,290
I take some vitamin supplements.

30
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,290
And I...

31
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,790
I found out that that was what was making me sick.

32
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,830
So I...

33
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,670
That will only take half.

34
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,170
Yeah, the iron.

35
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,690
Yeah!

36
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,570
I didn't know that iron supplements... I would, like, take it...

37
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,830
And then I would, like, feel so nauseous.

38
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,370
I thought for some time I would have, like, food poisoning.

39
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,050
But I think it was...

40
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,070
It's because, like... I don't know.

41
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,070
There's something with...

42
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,690
Iron supplements that...

43
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,930
Can make you feel... I don't take a lot.

44
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,890
I don't take a lot.

45
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,690
I think it's just...

46
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,170
It's just something that a lot of people have...

47
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,010
With the iron supplements.

48
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,710
Oh my gosh.

49
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:56,930
So...

50
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,170
Yeah.

51
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,150
The little... I got some gummies.

52
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,030
Some iron supplements.

53
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,990
Gummies in Japan.

54
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,050
And...

55
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,770
It said take two a day.

56
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,210
I remember when I would...

57
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,710
I felt so horrible.

58
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,730
And I was like, why do I feel so bad?

59
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,840
Phantoms need iron?

60
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,580
Yeah, you know...

61
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
For, like, ectoplasms.

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,040
They teach it to you in school.

63
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,020
Well, probably not your schools.

64
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,400
You know.

65
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm at Olive Garden.

66
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
What should I order?

67
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,360
What do they have at Olive Garden?

68
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,510
What do they have at Olive... Breadsticks?

69
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,070
Order some breadsticks.

70
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,130
Made Minky Mingo Wimpo.

71
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,130
I was wondering if you got any updates from Mitsukiyo-san about uploading the intro stand-alone so we can lose it.

72
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:00,790
Oh, lose it.

73
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,510
Loop it.

74
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,830
I'm ready to lose it.

75
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:16,490
He messaged me actually the other night about posting it on Twitter on his end.

76
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:25,330
I'll ask if I can also post it on YouTube as its own thing.

77
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,410
You guys like my opening BGM that much?

78
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,590
It's so good, isn't it?

79
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,930
Right?

80
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,600
Let's need iron in order to generate electromagnetic fields to scare Zach Bagans.

81
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,940
Happy Saturday Minto.

82
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,620
Happy Saturday!

83
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,360
Happy Saturday.

84
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,380
Such an earworm.

85
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
I know, right?

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,180
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy.

87
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,380
So happy I can work with Mitsukiyo.

88
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm heading to Japan so I was wondering if you have any recommendations for what to eat out there.

89
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Eat.

90
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,100
Moss Burger.

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,420
Eat Moss Burger Teriyaki Rice Bun Burger.

92
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,140
Some people will tell you that Moss Burger is mid.

93
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,660
But Moss Burger Teriyaki Rice Bun Burger is the greatest thing ever!

94
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
So good.

95
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,720
I don't know.

96
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,160
I've never had anything else on the menu except the Rice Bun Burger.

97
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,540
So honestly the rest of it might be mid.

98
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
I have no idea.

99
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,180
It's a great intro especially after our cries.

100
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,840
I like Moss.

101
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,300
I got that burger last night.

102
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,180
Let's go!

103
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,200
Let's go.

104
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm literally about to go to Akiba.

105
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,460
Is there a place I have to go?

106
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,700
Everywhere.

107
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,390
Melon Books.

108
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,330
Melon Books is good.

109
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,910
It can be smelly in there sometimes.

110
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,650
I'll go in there and I'll be like...

111
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:30,930
Wow.

112
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,410
This is man smell.

113
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,210
It smells so bad in here.

114
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,050
They need like a... What's it called?

115
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,590
Like an air freshener that smells like melons, you know?

116
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,210
No, you're not late at all.

117
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,210
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

118
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,650
Welcome back Minto.

119
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,670
I wasn't able to catch yesterday's stream, but I'm here now.

120
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,130
It's also my birthday!

121
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,070
Kita!

122
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,290
I thought I'd send my first super chat to celebrate.

123
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,910
Thank you!

124
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,770
Happy birthday!

125
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,130
Happy birthday to you.

126
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,650
Happy birthday to you.

127
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,250
Happy birthday dear Kita Tomoe.

128
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,990
Happy birthday to you.

129
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,210
Happy birthday!

130
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,510
I have a bit of an update perhaps, maybe.

131
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,410
A potential update on potential merchandise.

132
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,250
Maybe...

133
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,650
Your wallets.

134
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,890
Be careful next week.

135
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,430
Maybe.

136
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,090
If all goes well.

137
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,090
If all goes well.

138
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,550
Shipping might take a while, so I apologize in advance.

139
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,970
But maybe like a couple months, honestly.

140
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,510
But...

141
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,040
We shall see.

142
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,380
We're used to long ship times.

143
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,820
I feel so bad though.

144
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
Like I thought that was unfortunately the first thing I thought about too.

145
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,240
I was just like, well, I feel most people are used to long ship times at this point.

146
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,680
And then I was like, no!

147
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,340
That's such a bad way to think!

148
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,560
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,860
My wallet?

150
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,380
No!

151
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,380
I'm ready to be in debt now!

152
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,260
Gonna buy some Ayami books if I found one.

153
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,200
Waiting for a Minto one someday.

154
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, check Melon...

155
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,240
The past couple of times I've been to Melon Books, I feel her books have been sold out.

156
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,120
Ayami Mama so popular.

157
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,700
But...

158
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,800
Minto and Melon Books.

159
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,320
That would be the dream.

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,140
That would be the dream.

161
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,540
But also Comiket is coming up, so...

162
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,340
We'll see.

163
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,360
Yeah.

164
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,530
Comiket is coming up.

165
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,350
Which I will be going to Comiket by the way.

166
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,490
So, that'll be interesting.

167
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,970
I prefer winter Comiket, but it's so cold.

168
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,030
Down!

169
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,090
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

170
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,090
Say hi to Ayami Mama for us.

171
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,610
Are you going to try and vlog it?

172
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,110
That is...

173
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,090
That is the...

174
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,470
The goal.

175
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,230
But...

176
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,390
I don't know.

177
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,090
It's kind of...

178
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,330
How does Comiket smell compared to Melon Books smell?

179
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,310
Comiket is not bad at all actually.

180
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,630
Comiket is way more organized than I think people realize.

181
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,990
Like, it's very, quite easy to actually get around.

182
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,690
And as long as you know what circles you're trying to hit up, it's actually not so bad.

183
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,810
Yeah, it's actually not so bad.

184
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,110
Comiket.

185
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,330
Yeah.

186
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,610
Yeah, sorry, I'm going to Japan again.

187
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,930
It's meant to be a short trip.

188
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,710
I have...

189
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,120
It's an important reason that I have to go, so...

190
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,110
I figured I would be there for maybe, I guess, Comiket as well, so...

191
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,410
Ahem.

192
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:39,630
Ah.

193
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,410
Minto Frequent Flyer.

194
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,550
I know.

195
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,610
New maid cafe opening?

196
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,310
More like...

197
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,870
Favorite thing is closing.

198
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,710
So, final time I'm able to see Favorite Thing.

199
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,990
Unfortunately.

200
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,150
So I was like...

201
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,370
I hate the time of year that it's at.

202
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,770
Yeah, I did a karaoke with Denpogumi Inc.

203
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,650
A couple months ago they announced their final...

204
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,150
They announced their disbandment, disbanding.

205
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,330
And so finally the final...

206
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,890
The final show is upon us.

207
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,070
In about a month.

208
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,510
So...

209
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,630
Yeah.

210
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,310
Yeah.

211
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,050
So I'm sorry.

212
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,450
I feel bad because I really have taken so many trips over there, but...

213
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,510
There's just some things that I'm like...

214
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,690
I've missed so many...

215
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,510
In the past I've missed so many...

216
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,990
Graduations and disbandments and everything like that.

217
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,410
So I...

218
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,070
I feel...

219
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,850
Very grateful that I can go.

220
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,550
And...

221
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,010
And see them one last time.

222
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,130
And maybe my Kamiyoshi will make an appearance since she retired in like 2018.

223
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,290
Maybe.

224
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,030
If Comiket can be well organized, clean and good hygiene from all attendees...

225
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,190
Maybe all of attendees is a bit of a stretch.

226
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,470
People going to anime conventions like Otakudan, Anime Expo, etc.

227
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,550
have no excuse.

228
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,470
Well, okay.

229
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,830
I'll be honest though.

230
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,170
I've never been to Comiket in the summer.

231
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,810
Only Comiket in the winter.

232
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,730
In the winter, obviously, it's probably gonna be less sweaty, smelly, right?

233
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,210
I've never been to Comiket in the summer, so...

234
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,430
I thought Henya was your Kamiyoshi.

235
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:55,270
No, the difference between VTuber Kamiyoshi and Idol Kamiyoshi.

236
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,250
Difference, difference.

237
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:00,890
But yeah.

238
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,710
So, I don't know.

239
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,210
It might be...

240
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,430
It might be that...

241
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,510
Because, A, Anime Expo is in the summer.

242
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,630
Otakudan is in the summer.

243
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,670
Probably also Comiket's smelly.

244
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,090
I've been thinking about cosplaying though.

245
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,170
I don't know what I would cosplay.

246
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,470
I kinda wanna cosplay Blue Archive.

247
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,670
But it might be...

248
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,810
It might be...

249
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,650
Cold.

250
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,430
Well, the one time I did cosplay at Comiket...

251
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,550
I cosplayed Kaguya Luna.

252
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,270
And my arms were actually...

253
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,450
Like, I thought the ectoplasm was just going to turn into ice.

254
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,750
Like, if I...

255
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,790
I was so cold.

256
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,070
I was absolutely freezing.

257
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,830
So...

258
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,710
I don't know.

259
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,670
And also, if you've never been...

260
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,270
Okay, so if you go to cosplay...

261
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,650
If you go to cosplay...

262
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,250
You have to get changed in a room full of people.

263
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,810
Cherrino cosplay.

264
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,110
Cherrino might work.

265
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,110
Or...

266
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,630
Maybe.

267
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,750
Maybe you can go for Dempa final.

268
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,550
I saw them at Japan Expo Thailand and it changed my life way.

269
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,560
Can you give me some Firefly merch at Winter Comiket Mint?

270
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,420
Get your own!

271
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,100
Spank, thanks for the 20 good words!

272
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,460
Yeah, Red Winter dress warmly.

273
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,340
Maybe.

274
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,340
I'll think about it.

275
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,980
Also, it's like a pain in the butt though.

276
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,740
To cosplay.

277
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,980
Takes up so much space in the suitcase, you know.

278
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,600
Try Eva.

279
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,580
Sorry,

280
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,790
I've been talking for so long.

281
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,390
We're here to play Astro Bot!

282
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,870
Astro Bot.

283
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,870
Astro Bot.

284
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,710
Today might be the last day I play Astro Bot.

285
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,890
I might try to get through the final...

286
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,870
Final universe that we have left.

287
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,890
And then I might just be like, you know...

288
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,010
Time for other games, right?

289
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,330
Thanks Astros!

290
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,170
We love the yap!

291
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,950
25... No, no.

292
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,570
Actually, we're at game progress 55%.

293
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,370
The 75% you see there is a level.

294
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,510
Just a single level.

295
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,890
Not a...

296
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,570
Not the game.

297
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,890
But I think the 55% is like all the trophies and...

298
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,970
There's of course some bots I didn't get.

299
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,370
Some worlds I didn't see.

300
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,110
But that's okay!

301
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,710
How much do you think there is left?

302
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,030
As far as time goes?

303
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,490
I'm not sure to be honest.

304
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,910
I'm already starting to feel better.

305
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,210
So I think I'll just kind of go for as long as I feel like.

306
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:45,990
Yeah!

307
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,250
Maybe I'll even go back and get some things.

308
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,150
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,870
Hi Pinto!

310
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,610
How are you today?

311
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,350
I'm good!

312
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,470
Astro Bot.

313
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,050
Yeah!

314
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,360
Audio is...

315
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,220
Yeah, we have this bird place.

316
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,780
The last one.

317
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,160
The Feather Cluster.

318
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,220
But before we do that...

319
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,940
Yeah, maybe we...

320
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,780
Maybe we grab some that we haven't finished yet.

321
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,020
See?

322
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,600
There's two little guys here.

323
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,060
Oh wait, those are the extra levels.

324
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,620
Okay, nevermind.

325
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,520
There's a puzzle piece here we're missing.

326
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,060
No snake on the title screen.

327
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,820
So sad.

328
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,180
These are the last ones.

329
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,020
Which, we have quite a few actually.

330
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,740
Look at that.

331
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,160
Wow.

332
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,220
And then...

333
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,840
The puzzle piece here.

334
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,720
Yeah, so...

335
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,480
Like I said, I'm not gonna 100% so if I don't get every single little bot, that's okay.

336
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,520
But here, I definitely wanna go get this portal.

337
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,900
I think it'll drive me crazy otherwise.

338
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,360
We're missing a puzzle piece and a portal!

339
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,300
We gotta get this!

340
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,240
Astro Bot turned out to be quite the extensive game.

341
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,840
Right!

342
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,320
Honestly!

343
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,000
It was so funny.

344
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,460
When I posted my waiting room earlier on Twitter.com...

345
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,920
I looked over and I saw Astro Bot was trending.

346
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,260
And I was like, what?

347
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,800
And I think it's because...

348
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,920
What's his name?

349
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,840
George Keeley.

350
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,780
What's his... George?

351
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,320
I think it's because he posted about the...

352
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,500
What's it called?

353
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,140
The Game Awards?

354
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,500
Jeff!

355
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,420
Jeff Keeley.

356
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,920
Posted about the Game Awards and was just like, oh, Game of the Year is...

357
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,920
Nominations will be announced soon and I think...

358
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,240
People are... A lot of people were like Astro Bot.

359
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,520
And I saw a bunch of places posting about Astro Bot too.

360
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,340
I saw Resident Evil and everything.

361
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,040
So many posting about Astro Bot.

362
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,680
I was like, what?

363
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,620
Should I buy this?

364
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,540
Oh, I don't have enough.

365
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,720
Alright guys, we're gonna do this on our own.

366
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,520
We got this.

367
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,800
We got this.

368
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,680
Probably.

369
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,760
They just added the last DLC update.

370
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,420
Is that why?

371
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,220
Oh my gosh.

372
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,960
There's just so much in this game.

373
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,260
It's kind of awesome.

374
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,500
Kill that guy.

375
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,060
If you guys don't mind helping me a little bit though...

376
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,060
Maybe we can get the...

377
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,060
Puzzle piece and the...

378
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,380
Wait, how do I...

379
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,060
Go in there, but like...

380
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,280
Why won't you stick in there?

381
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,260
Yes, help.

382
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,160
Yes, help!

383
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,880
Please.

384
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,700
So we can get it.

385
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,340
Okay guys.

386
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm gonna look around places that...

387
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,320
Maybe perhaps I could have missed it.

388
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,560
Yes, help.

389
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,200
We got you.

390
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,500
Oh my god.

391
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,140
That guy just snuck up on me.

392
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,140
The puzzle piece or the warp?

393
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,040
Both.

394
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,020
Both!

395
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,540
Both!

396
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,500
A-Akuran merch for me.

397
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,080
Wait, how did this work again?

398
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,640
Oh, that's right!

399
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,570
Froggy gloves.

400
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,450
I'm looking around the si...

401
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,950
Oh no, that's nothing.

402
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,650
I'm looking around the sides...

403
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,910
To see...

404
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,710
If there's any puzzle pieces or warps...

405
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,550
That might be around.

406
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,740
Oh my god.

407
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,200
Can I punch his back at him?

408
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,680
Oh no.

409
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,770
Wait a second.

410
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,570
Wow!

411
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,370
I don't even know if I noticed that before.

412
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,710
Nice.

413
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,480
Okay.

414
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh wait.

415
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,420
Punch.

416
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,060
No, turn this way bot.

417
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,340
There we go.

418
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,940
Hey, it's Minto.

419
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,580
It's me.

420
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,740
Sorry for no schedule this week.

421
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,580
I will have one, of course, for next week.

422
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,700
Since I've just gotten back, I was like...

423
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh, I'm not sure what I will be doing.

424
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,480
But we will have one.

425
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,700
Rest assured.

426
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,320
Oh, there's lots of money.

427
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,140
This is a good way to get more money too.

428
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,540
Hmm.

429
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,700
Appreciate you guys always being so...

430
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,420
So patient with me.

431
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,380
Thank you guys.

432
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,180
Have I missed anything yet?

433
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,780
I don't think.

434
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,560
Oh, I did.

435
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,860
I missed that.

436
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,040
Had some tough competition.

437
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,040
Yeah, I honestly...

438
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,260
I think it might get nominated.

439
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,920
But even if it gets nominated, I don't...

440
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,200
I don't quite think it will win.

441
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,900
As much as I would want it to.

442
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,320
I just think, you know, I'm just like...

443
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,280
Make...

444
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,220
Bring back fun video games.

445
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,200
Bring back games that like Spark, Whimsy and Joy, you know.

446
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,420
Just a little bit.

447
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,740
Games that are just kind of...

448
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,660
Fun and, you know, silly.

449
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,780
This one is just so well made too.

450
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,200
Which is such a fun.

451
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,580
I've been having every time...

452
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,040
I've been having so much fun with it every time.

453
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,050
I miss silly games.

454
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,590
Oh my goodness.

455
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,550
Oh my god.

456
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,270
It was...

457
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:18,380
I think it's like...

458
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,360
You might enjoy the new Zelda.

459
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:20,720
Yeah!

460
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,160
And then like...

461
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,500
The graphics in it.

462
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,340
Like everything just looks so good, you know.

463
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,920
It's just like...

464
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,420
It's like...

465
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,820
This is like peak game.

466
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,110
Hit torches?

467
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,770
These?

468
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:40,930
Oh.

469
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,070
Wait.

470
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,200
Wait.

471
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,560
Nice.

472
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,360
Punch you over here.

473
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,160
Punch you over here.

474
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,720
Help me!

475
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,700
Thank you!

476
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,380
Wait, but about the last...

477
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,480
Oh my gosh!

478
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,500
Thank you!

479
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,180
100% the game, definitely worth.

480
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,240
Even the stuff added after launch.

481
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,340
Oh, awesome!

482
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,840
Help get...

483
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,940
Yes, thank you!

484
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,020
But...

485
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,000
What about the other puzzle piece?

486
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,440
Yeah, can we get the other puzzle piece and come back, I wonder.

487
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,800
Oh, I need you over here.

488
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,960
You need to go twice.

489
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,350
Yeah, right now viewers are assuring the streamer Minto that everything is alright.

490
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,650
They are glad that he is taking care of himself.

491
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,700
Second puzzle piece...

492
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,320
Is...

493
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,980
Is...

494
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,180
Wait.

495
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,820
Basically do the level a second time.

496
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,870
I have to?

497
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,450
Second puzzle piece might be passed apart.

498
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,910
You can't return from truth.

499
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,030
He didn't help.

500
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,210
Minto found it on her own.

501
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,450
Minto voice changer.

502
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,790
This is what I really sound like, guys.

503
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,090
You accept me?

504
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,630
The voice changer has been removed.

505
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,550
Alright.

506
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,490
Nice.

507
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,230
At least the portal isn't very far in.

508
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,030
Grapple?

509
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,950
How do you know my name?

510
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,710
How do you know my name?

511
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:25,930
Secret...

512
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,750
Oh my gosh, it was so towards the beginning.

513
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:29,790
What?

514
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,850
Secret...

515
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,910
Some of these I haven't completed either.

516
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,830
Oh, I remember this one.

517
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,850
This one is so... This one is at the very end.

518
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,950
Because I really want to finish all the puzzle piece stuff.

519
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,590
That's one thing I do really want to finish.

520
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,710
Fan club?

521
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,130
Wow.

522
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,190
Wow.

523
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,950
My mom's been really enjoying these streams with me.

524
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,950
Fun games are the best.

525
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,030
Thank you, Senpai.

526
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,590
Thanks to your mom.

527
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,550
Oh my gosh, wait.

528
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,410
That reminds me.

529
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,450
Thank you for saying your mom.

530
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,150
Someone before stream, I saw...

531
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,390
Someone said really...

532
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,190
Someone said that it was their mom's birthday.

533
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,350
Kelly!

534
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,610
Mom Kelly!

535
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,890
If you're here, happy birthday!

536
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,210
Happy birthday to you.

537
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,290
Happy birthday to you.

538
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,910
Happy birthday, Mom Kelly.

539
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,370
Happy birthday to you.

540
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,070
Happy birthday!

541
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,110
I don't know if they're still here.

542
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,270
Or if they'll even hear that, but hopefully.

543
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,910
But should we go... Let's do the fan club real quick.

544
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,550
We can check out what it's like.

545
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,910
Mama Kelly.

546
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,190
Blow!

547
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,920
It's kind of...

548
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,060
Wow.

549
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,700
Here's your cut, boss.

550
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,100
What?

551
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,400
What did I get?

552
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,760
What did I get?

553
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,480
Hello?

554
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,350
I had to jump up.

555
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,650
That's so cute!

556
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,210
Oh no.

557
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,970
The bane of my existence, literally.

558
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,310
Oh my gosh.

559
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,310
That was close.

560
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,510
No!

561
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,490
No!

562
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,430
I

563
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,060
kicked his butt.

564
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,520
I was thinking Astro Bot can't win Gimme the Year.

565
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,920
It's against Baldur's Gate.

566
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,060
Three tears to the camera.

567
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,060
Those are last year, right?

568
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,760
Silly, those are last year.

569
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,960
Oh my god, he's drowning!

570
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,020
Oh my god.

571
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,980
No,

572
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,980
like I said, I don't...

573
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,900
I mean...

574
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,160
I don't want to say anything is rigged.

575
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
But I'm just saying...

576
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,190
That if a company had a lot of money...

577
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:41,160
And were to pay for more people to vote for a game that had a bunch of IPs...

578
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,020
I'm just saying.

579
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,560
But I do genuinely think this is such a good game.

580
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,980
So...

581
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,820
But I'm saying.

582
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,640
I'm just, you know.

583
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,840
Oh,

584
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,360
fun.

585
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,140
Not fun.

586
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,490
Just saying.

587
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,890
I'm not saying anything.

588
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,490
I'm just saying.

589
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,590
You know what I mean?

590
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,170
I'm not saying anything.

591
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,370
I'm just saying.

592
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:28,910
Okay.

593
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,590
There are so many guys here.

594
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,330
Wow, it's beautiful.

595
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,670
Bellatro sweep.

596
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,930
I've never played Bellatro.

597
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,090
What is in here?

598
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,020
Is it... Is it like...

599
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,040
How do I say it?

600
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,050
Like...

601
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,790
Poker?

602
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,670
He went to his ass slap, baby!

603
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,570
Who is this?

604
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,410
Mudokon Liberator.

605
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,730
Don't pull his finger.

606
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,910
Who is this?

607
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,170
Roguelike Poker.

608
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,500
If only they had...

609
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,500
If only they had a blackjack...

610
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,140
Then you know I'd be all in, baby.

611
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,940
That's kind of my thing.

612
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,340
Oh!

613
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,820
It killed me.

614
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,980
Okay, there we go.

615
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,460
Yeah.

616
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,100
This is so cute.

617
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,600
I thought it was going to be way different than how...

618
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,040
Than how it is.

619
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,280
Wait, hold on.

620
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,800
Let's go up here.

621
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,700
Yeah.

622
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
I thought this was going to be way different.

623
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,740
Like I thought we were going to use the fans to fly and all that.

624
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,320
Oh, hello.

625
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,860
Thank you!

626
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
There's a puzzle piece.

627
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,060
How do I get over here?

628
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,510
Okay.

629
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,300
Laser jump?

630
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,120
You think I can make it?

631
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,320
Seeing you enjoy silly games and laughing warms my heart.

632
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,280
Ow!

633
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,260
I should have known.

634
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,980
I'm glad!

635
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,030
Yay!

636
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,190
That was so easy.

637
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,170
He didn't even try.

638
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,970
I don't think he even tried.

639
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,070
What is going on in there?

640
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,030
Oh no!

641
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:15,790
Okay.

642
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,290
This place looks so breezy.

643
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,330
I would like to visit.

644
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,530
I would like to visit this location.

645
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,590
I got you!

646
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,190
I got you!

647
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,450
Where are you?

648
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,390
I got you!

649
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:45,830
I got you!

650
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,890
I got...

651
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,030
Do you like public transport in Japan?

652
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,390
Yeah, I don't mind it.

653
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,420
Actually, I like it quite a lot because I enjoy...

654
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,150
I don't enjoy driving and I like walking.

655
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,680
Mudokon Minion.

656
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,940
Always laughs at the same joke.

657
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,620
Oh, they are like the same little guy.

658
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:14,920
Okay.

659
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,440
Oh no!

660
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,760
Aha!

661
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,880
Kind of a genius slice.

662
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,340
Same species.

663
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,760
Oh gosh, this looks scary you guys.

664
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,220
Minto is streaming.

665
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,000
I knew I smelled something stinky.

666
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,460
This is the guy called Eggman.

667
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,240
Your name is literally Egg...

668
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh my gosh.

669
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,920
When I was coming home, the person next to me was eating eggs on the plane.

670
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:51,980
Why?

671
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,540
Why would you eat eggs on the plane?

672
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,260
Oh gosh, it smelled so bad.

673
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,640
She like peeled a hard boiled egg.

674
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,980
I was like, no!

675
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,500
We made it.

676
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,320
I was so...

677
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,220
That's devious.

678
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,380
I know, right?

679
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,560
I was like...

680
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,240
Eggs?

681
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,080
We missed a puzzle piece you guys.

682
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,040
No!

683
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,900
Can I fall back down?

684
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,120
Oh, the world has disappeared around us.

685
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,120
No!

686
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,760
I missed a puzzle piece!

687
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,520
I didn't realize.

688
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,720
Got it.

689
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,910
That one just pissed me off.

690
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,630
It's okay.

691
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,350
Overall, it was fine.

692
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,450
It was a decent flight.

693
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,250
Secret.

694
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,510
This one is also missing a puzzle piece.

695
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,080
We can do more gacha.

696
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,660
We could do more gacha.

697
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,620
Look at how big my army is.

698
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
Look how many guys.

699
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,140
We have 226.

700
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,960
Just a single piece.

701
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,760
Crash site.

702
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,620
Thank you guys.

703
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,200
Everybody, return to your positions.

704
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,220
Excuse me.

705
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,960
I just launched.

706
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,260
Oh boy guys.

707
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,180
Oh boy.

708
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,600
I hope I get no bottles.

709
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,540
I thought it was Raiden at first.

710
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,580
We don't have...

711
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,400
Did we get Raiden?

712
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,700
His sword?

713
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,440
Foreigner's Katana.

714
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,180
Keeps the yokai at bay.

715
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,180
Did we ever get his...

716
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,140
Outfit?

717
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,940
Horned Protector Outfit.

718
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,240
An iconic look.

719
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,060
Is this Undertale?

720
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,920
No, we didn't, right?

721
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,280
Is this it?

722
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,160
No.

723
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,600
Inherited Uchigatana.

724
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,160
This family heirloom slays.

725
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,080
I'm already out of money?

726
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,980
I only did like three.

727
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,440
Yeah, I don't think we got Raiden's sword, right?

728
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,420
Where is that guy?

729
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,260
Where is that silly...

730
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,180
Silly, silly...

731
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,740
There he is.

732
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,840
He's so bored.

733
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,480
He's so bored he's hand boning.

734
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,420
Do something, Raiden.

735
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:01,960
Do something.

736
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,860
He's like, you go do something.

737
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,280
You go make some money.

738
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,400
Okay.

739
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:06,560
Okay.

740
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,060
There we go.

741
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,000
Off we go.

742
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,160
Saucy Jack.

743
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,300
He only had 359 coins.

744
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,900
I forgot that it was 100 per...

745
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,760
I thought...I don't know.

746
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,180
It's okay.

747
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,300
We're gonna go make lots more money.

748
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,780
Ginny of the lab.

749
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,700
Oh my gosh, a Gin for real.

750
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,300
This one has a lot of guys, so...

751
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,400
Let's go.

752
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,620
Oh, nice.

753
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,560
Oh, nice.

754
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,700
We'll get it.

755
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,280
Okay.

756
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,380
I had a feeling it was gonna be like that.

757
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,200
I had a feeling.

758
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,020
I had a feeling.

759
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:10,940
Oh, no, no.

760
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,580
How do I boost again?

761
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,380
Boost!

762
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,810
What are you?

763
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,510
Oh, sorry.

764
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,910
You live here, my bud.

765
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,110
He's like, I'm just a guy.

766
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,150
Chill out.

767
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,250
Look how cute he is in his little aviators.

768
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,250
His little aviators...

769
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,510
Goggles and everything.

770
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,750
I don't wanna hurt you.

771
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,450
It's my plane now.

772
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,670
Oh my gosh.

773
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,950
This is so fun.

774
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,870
I love this game so much.

775
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,010
Monkey!

776
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,110
I'm the sultan.

777
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,730
Oh, I have no face.

778
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,390
Are they Gangnam Style?

779
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,090
No, okay.

780
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:13,770
We're good.

781
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,930
Oh, perfect.

782
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,310
They look so shocked.

783
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,740
Little monkey.

784
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,580
Nice.

785
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,740
Thank you.

786
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:03,510
This music is so hard.

787
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,010
So cute.

788
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,210
Oh wait, it's not even a real plane.

789
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:10,950
It's fake.

790
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,470
Can I get up on those, I wonder?

791
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:18,290
Oops.

792
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,250
Oopsie.

793
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,750
I forgot that those guys smash.

794
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,020
Squish.

795
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,420
Do I have to get my money back?

796
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,400
Yeah, I could do.

797
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,640
I gotta go over here.

798
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,060
This map looks very...

799
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,520
Usually the maps are pretty linear, but this one is all over the place.

800
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,180
You see this?

801
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,300
There's someone on every corner.

802
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,300
It's craziness.

803
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,020
Oh, I almost had it.

804
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,080
Okay, hold on.

805
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,140
I'll save you!

806
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,680
Palace and Bazaar.

807
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah, it's crazy.

808
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,200
Gotcha.

809
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,900
Gotcha!

810
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,060
He's not even the first guy we need to get.

811
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,520
Look how many guys there are.

812
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,920
There's just enemies everywhere!

813
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,880
And I see that puzzle piece up there.

814
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:27,960
Can I ride this?

815
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,280
I tried to jump.

816
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,640
What about the clothes?

817
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,350
There we go.

818
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,930
There's also like a thing on top of that.

819
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,950
There's so much going on here.

820
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,190
What is this first?

821
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,450
Oh no!

822
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:08,040
I heard Minto does a sound that a concerned person would love.

823
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,000
Can I hear it again?

824
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:11,740
I do a sound?

825
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,140
I do a sound?

826
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,480
I do a sound?

827
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,400
What are those poop bots?

828
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,340
They attach to you because they're stinky.

829
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,240
Sometimes you're rewarded.

830
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,420
Rewarded.

831
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,230
I see him up there.

832
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,750
Let's go over here.

833
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,010
Let's check out...

834
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,870
There's so many!

835
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:53,770
He's doing it!

836
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,310
What's my sound?

837
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,810
I don't even know what sound I make.

838
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,960
Don't even try buddy.

839
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,860
Who are you?

840
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,740
Galactic Pirate.

841
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,840
Seeker of the Seven Star Sword.

842
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,420
Character is from Rogue Galaxy.

843
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,660
I see.

844
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,320
Look how many things are going on in here.

845
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,220
It's craziness.

846
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,760
Absolutely.

847
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,100
Absolutely.

848
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:45,050
I'm rewarded for exploration.

849
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,050
So fun.

850
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,830
Be careful.

851
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,230
Be careful little guy.

852
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,310
Yay!

853
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,890
Finding the Steak Astro Bot.

854
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,050
So...

855
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,550
What's concerning about that?

856
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,420
There we go.

857
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,960
What's concerning about that?

858
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:23,940
What?

859
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,700
No one's concerned.

860
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,260
No one's concerned, right guys?

861
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,180
Oh no, poor elephant.

862
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,440
Oh my gosh.

863
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,600
Holy cow.

864
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,140
Oh my goodness.

865
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,720
Let's just stand here.

866
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,620
This is totally normal.

867
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,340
Oh, sorry.

868
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,720
What's this?

869
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,520
Why?

870
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,280
How dare you come to my chat and say that?

871
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,450
I want that sound as my ringtone.

872
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,270
I can't just make a sound, you know?

873
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,450
I have to make it out of pure passion.

874
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,730
It's not just something... It's something that comes from the heart, you know?

875
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,430
It's not just something that I can be like, yeah, I'll make that sound for you.

876
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,690
No, I gotta... I gotta experience it, you know?

877
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,430
I gotta feel it.

878
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,130
Concern would imply it was an entirely predictable mental behavior.

879
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,950
Death to these guys!

880
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,720
Raw mental emotion.

881
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,420
Exactly!

882
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,040
Monkey!

883
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:11,820
Minky!

884
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,760
I slide right back down.

885
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,140
That scared the heck out of me.

886
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,560
Oh my gosh.

887
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,560
Is there anything around here?

888
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,760
So if you try to escape the world...

889
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,760
First of all...

890
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,940
OK.

891
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,260
Yes, I eventually can... I was gonna say...

892
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,520
How far can I go?

893
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,000
Not quite far actually.

894
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,600
Why are you doing that?

895
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,680
Why are you acting like a fool?

896
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,260
The way you say Minky makes it ten times funnier?

897
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:56,860
Minky!

898
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,880
It's like my favorite thing to say right now.

899
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,840
I'm so sorry.

900
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,560
It's just something about it.

901
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,960
Let's kill this guy too.

902
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,640
And take his money.

903
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,300
Oh shoot, we were so close.

904
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,260
Dumb Minky.

905
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:26,720
Oh

906
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:32,790
my god!

907
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,970
I just killed that guy!

908
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:35,950
How

909
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
can I not make it?

910
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,460
Maybe I need to go from this building instead.

911
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,240
Oh, I think...

912
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,520
OK, hold on.

913
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,360
We have to go a little bit ways of a roundabout way.

914
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,880
We have to take the clothesline.

915
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,140
We have to be a little pervert about it.

916
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,840
There we go.

917
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,240
OK.

918
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,440
Now watch.

919
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,240
Watch, watch.

920
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,580
The purple leaves?

921
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,020
I don't think you can jump on them.

922
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,080
I think we gotta go...

923
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,020
I was so close.

924
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:16,740
OK, here we go.

925
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,560
I think we go from...

926
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,220
Yeah!

927
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,980
Nice.

928
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,500
What is this?

929
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,680
Hell yeah!

930
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:42,080
I mean, I'll try from the purple leaves, but I really don't think it was...

931
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,560
Yeah, see?

932
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,420
Yeah, I can't.

933
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,280
I had that idea too though, earlier.

934
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,860
What's going on over here, huh?

935
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,000
What's going on over here?

936
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,720
Oh, I guess I could have used this.

937
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,040
Oh, it's OK.

938
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,660
I have an idea.

939
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,340
Maybe Minky in the donation pool?

940
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,300
Oh my gosh, what picture would we have for Minky?

941
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,100
Wait!

942
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,040
I could do that one of me doing the silly kick.

943
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,080
Come on!

944
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:30,420
Oh my God.

945
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,340
Yeah!

946
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,140
Nice.

947
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,560
Wait.

948
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,560
Before we go... Oh, sorry!

949
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,020
Oh, I'm so sorry!

950
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,640
I didn't... I thought there was... I'm sorry!

951
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,500
Here, I'll clean it up.

952
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,140
I'll clean it up.

953
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,800
I'll clean it up for you.

954
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,240
Into the bucket.

955
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,960
Everything in the bucket.

956
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,220
I'll clean it up.

957
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,020
He looks so traumatized.

958
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,300
No!

959
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,560
I'm sorry!

960
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,140
He's like... He's literally the cabbage guy from Avatar.

961
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,160
My bolts!

962
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,060
My nuts!

963
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,620
My nuts and bolts!

964
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,560
Wow!

965
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,300
Oh my God, it's crazy!

966
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,740
At what level does Minky evolve into Primmick?

967
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:34,820
Never.

968
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,980
Minky is a one evolution.

969
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,020
The only evolution you ever need.

970
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,560
Destroy!

971
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,100
Destroy!

972
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,200
There's gotta be money in here.

973
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,520
Big cash dollars.

974
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,080
See?

975
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,920
I told you.

976
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,020
That was so evil.

977
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,180
And big cash dollars!

978
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:06,920
Money.

979
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:07,700
There, see?

980
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,700
It pays to destroy.

981
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,000
This is all learned from Legend of Zelda.

982
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,380
I won't be able to watch stream today, but I just want to say goodbye Johnny's Combat.

983
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,440
It was nice seeing you.

984
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,080
I'm gonna miss that cute little war cry.

985
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,480
Hi chat.

986
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:27,900
Hi Minto.

987
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:28,820
Hello!

988
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,940
You think I got everything so far?

989
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,440
Let's see.

990
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,000
Ok, maybe.

991
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,640
This first area was humongous.

992
00:57:47,000 --> 00:58:01,240
Oh my God.

993
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,400
Blizzard of Oz real.

994
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,700
What's happening?

995
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,950
Oh my God!

996
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:11,810
Minky!

997
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,310
Wait, you're not a real Minky.

998
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,500
That's not one of our guys, guys.

999
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,560
That's not one of our guys.

1000
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,120
We don't need to...

1001
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,100
No three wishes?

1002
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,460
This is a genie.

1003
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,020
It's a djinn.

1004
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,820
Oh my gosh.

1005
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,260
Wait, is that...

1006
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,720
Is that Nier?

1007
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,340
No.

1008
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,920
Who is this?

1009
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,190
Cat from Gravity Rush.

1010
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:48,610
Minky.

1011
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,440
We're all fighting for our lives up here.

1012
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:59,140
Can you just leave me alone while we're all fighting for our lives?

1013
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,520
Cat from Gravity Rush.

1014
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,480
You have a costume.

1015
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,420
That's right!

1016
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,220
Ok, I gotta be careful here.

1017
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,360
Oh my gosh.

1018
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,160
No, no, no.

1019
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:14,820
Evil, evil.

1020
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,820
Having a guy there.

1021
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,640
I got you!

1022
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,060
Hold on!

1023
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,380
I'll slap you off!

1024
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,800
Gravity shifter.

1025
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,360
If she's not in a rush, she's in a daze.

1026
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,560
Oh my gosh.

1027
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,720
This area is scary.

1028
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,180
Oh my God.

1029
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:32,880
Oh my God.

1030
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,020
Wait, which way am I going?

1031
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,400
Oh, towards this guy.

1032
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:42,980
There we go.

1033
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,600
Oh my gosh, I couldn't see it.

1034
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,800
I lost a coin, but...

1035
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,440
Guys, we're just gonna have to...

1036
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:54,860
It's fine.

1037
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,620
It's one coin.

1038
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,080
Why are there so many guys up here?

1039
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,600
Don't get greedy.

1040
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,480
I know, I know.

1041
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,000
This one's gonna be really tricky.

1042
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,560
Oh my God.

1043
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,920
He killed off most of them.

1044
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,740
That's so nice.

1045
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,040
What is a dog... Oh, I think he like smashes.

1046
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,040
Like he kind of like goes... Like that.

1047
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,480
Nice.

1048
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:36,610
Good thing we just got the...

1049
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,350
Oh my goodness.

1050
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,170
We got him?

1051
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,350
We got him?

1052
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,770
We're okay?

1053
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:55,270
We're still one puzzle piece and one portal and then three guys missing.

1054
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:58,670
We still have a lot left, so I imagine...

1055
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,270
I was kind of excited for the...

1056
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,110
The what's it called?

1057
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,990
The palace.

1058
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,490
I thought we'd be able to go on.

1059
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,090
A little disappointed.

1060
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:14,110
I feel like the puzzle piece is like gonna be flying in the air somewhere, you know?

1061
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,990
Oh wow.

1062
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,550
Okay, hold on.

1063
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,930
From here... I think I doggie dash over...

1064
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,330
Okay, nice.

1065
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,350
Excuse me.

1066
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:30,670
Minecraft.

1067
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:31,850
Minecraft bunny.

1068
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:32,890
Minecraft bunny.

1069
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,260
How did he recover?

1070
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,820
Maybe I don't...

1071
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:01,720
Don't...

1072
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,180
Maybe I just leave him alone.

1073
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,000
He's like a mini boss.

1074
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,340
No, no, I don't leave him alone.

1075
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:18,980
Stupid dog.

1076
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,220
You made me look bad.

1077
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,560
Oh my god, poopies.

1078
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,900
No, poop!

1079
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,650
No, more poop!

1080
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:37,850
Oh, sorry.

1081
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:45,490
We got him.

1082
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,630
We got him, don't worry.

1083
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:53,130
This poor snake is holding on.

1084
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:55,070
He's got no hands.

1085
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,610
He's got to use his little mouth.

1086
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,410
Can we rescue the snake too?

1087
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,910
This is so sad.

1088
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,410
Oh my god, this poor snake.

1089
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:08,530
Oh no.

1090
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,950
I want to rescue him.

1091
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,750
Take my hand.

1092
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,470
It's so sad.

1093
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,150
This guy is like, don't beat me up.

1094
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:23,650
Beat me up.

1095
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:26,150
You're pretty good.

1096
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,550
Should have been a lizard instead.

1097
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,810
How can he got no hands with his...

1098
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,130
I don't know.

1099
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,960
I don't remember how to defeat this guy.

1100
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,380
Oh, just kidding.

1101
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,700
That was close.

1102
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:01,760
Dash.

1103
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:02,880
We dash.

1104
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,580
We're dashing.

1105
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,800
We got Dasher and Dashing.

1106
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,660
Gizmo and Blooping.

1107
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,580
Nice.

1108
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,200
Come here.

1109
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,460
Oh my god.

1110
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:24,840
Skewer!

1111
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,520
Thanks for the membership, Danko.

1112
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,300
Welcome, welcome.

1113
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,200
Nice.

1114
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,860
Oh my god.

1115
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:35,180
Look

1116
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,200
at this guy.

1117
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,160
How am I supposed to kill him?

1118
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,860
He can't even handle himself.

1119
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,740
Minkies!

1120
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,700
Hold on tight, Minkies!

1121
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,280
My friend!

1122
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,160
Wait, how do I...

1123
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,600
Too heavy for the leaves.

1124
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,820
Minkies, send me up.

1125
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,260
Boost the tree.

1126
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,340
How did I live?

1127
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,380
How did I...

1128
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:39,920
Maybe

1129
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:49,090
I have to go from these blocks.

1130
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:50,930
Just kidding.

1131
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:55,620
Nice.

1132
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,820
I know that's what I'm about to do.

1133
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:05,820
Oh my god.

1134
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:06,540
Nice.

1135
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,040
Nice.

1136
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,300
First try, baby.

1137
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,100
Somehow we didn't die.

1138
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,640
Somehow we didn't die.

1139
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,050
Let's wait until the next rotation.

1140
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,960
Guys, we died.

1141
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,580
Poor guys.

1142
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,540
Bad...

1143
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,420
I have to go so fast.

1144
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,370
As soon as it happens.

1145
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:03,990
Nice.

1146
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,790
Oh my goodness.

1147
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:13,030
Maybe don't go in here.

1148
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,910
Kill him.

1149
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,510
Kill him again.

1150
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,390
Don't fall off this time.

1151
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,390
Kill him again.

1152
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:35,430
Don't fall off this time.

1153
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,250
Kill him again.

1154
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,450
Where do I go?

1155
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,450
Like a bo...

1156
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:07,630
This Fall Guys update is wild.

1157
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:08,990
Nice save.

1158
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,030
Holy cow.

1159
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:14,910
The dog is so dangerous.

1160
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,290
Is that the last puzzle piece?

1161
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,890
That was the last puzzle piece we needed.

1162
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,550
It was just so randomly in there.

1163
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:28,270
It was so random.

1164
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:31,050
I feel like...

1165
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:33,110
I knew it.

1166
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,610
I knew it.

1167
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:41,310
I was like, I feel like either a portal is gonna be around here...

1168
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,070
Or something.

1169
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,030
I got you.

1170
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,090
Raven from Gravity Rush.

1171
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:56,610
Yeah!

1172
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,990
Defender of Hexaville.

1173
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:03,010
Seems cold, but they'll crow on you.

1174
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:10,310
Okay, nice.

1175
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,030
But the portal...

1176
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:14,350
What is it?

1177
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:17,030
In like that little thing right there or something?

1178
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:17,910
I have no idea.

1179
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,550
Are these gonna turn around?

1180
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:23,910
No?

1181
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,900
Do I deflect this at you?

1182
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:42,800
Yep.

1183
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,320
Okay.

1184
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:44,640
I knew it.

1185
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,600
I knew it.

1186
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:51,970
Oh my god.

1187
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,470
Oh my god.

1188
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,250
Ouchie ouchie ouchie.

1189
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:01,010
Okay.

1190
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:02,770
Holy moly.

1191
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,610
Meet the defender of the otaku.

1192
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,520
Come here.

1193
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,100
Oh, not these guys though.

1194
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,800
These guys I avoid.

1195
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,620
Then this guy I...

1196
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,340
That was close.

1197
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,480
I'm not gonna lie.

1198
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,480
I don't ever have enough...

1199
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,480
I don't have enough...

1200
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,420
Jumping me.

1201
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,920
Okay, nice, nice.

1202
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,240
Not these guys.

1203
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,280
I can't... Oh, the wind is like making it more difficult.

1204
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:22,540
Ah...

1205
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,660
The wind makes it harder for...

1206
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:31,180
Makes it harder for me to stay up I think is what...

1207
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:33,680
Cause I'm like trying to move around, but I'm very slow.

1208
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,480
I think it's the wind.

1209
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:38,020
Okay.

1210
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,180
Okay.

1211
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,120
Might not wanna boost sideways.

1212
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,920
I think that's actually it.

1213
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,060
Okay.

1214
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,320
Okay.

1215
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:55,320
Okay.

1216
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,540
Play!

1217
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,560
Okay.

1218
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,060
These freaking guys.

1219
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,000
Oh gosh.

1220
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:12,660
Ah!

1221
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,880
Oh, I wonder if I can get them.

1222
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,760
Maybe I just run around and then they'll destroy them for me.

1223
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:21,680
You know?

1224
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,740
Oh my gosh.

1225
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,160
Maybe they'll destroy them for me.

1226
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,700
I'm just gonna ignore them.

1227
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:33,680
Oh...

1228
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,530
Alright, ignore, ignore, ignore.

1229
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,930
Unless I have to interact.

1230
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,090
I ignore unless I have to interact.

1231
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:46,810
Oh gosh, I have to interact!

1232
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,920
Can you only get hit once?

1233
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:07,760
Yeah, usually with the boss fights they give you multiple lives.

1234
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,680
I'm so surprised.

1235
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,320
That they only have... That it's only one life with these.

1236
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,980
I'm kind of shocked right now.

1237
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,180
Minky!

1238
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,630
Oh my gosh.

1239
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:36,110
Have you done any of the challenge levels?

1240
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:36,890
Of course I have.

1241
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,290
And I've completed every single one that I want to.

1242
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:45,770
It's not the planet boss.

1243
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:46,330
What?

1244
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:49,410
But he has an introduction.

1245
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,870
Minky!

1246
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,530
Maybe I dog through them.

1247
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:07,270
Oh my god!

1248
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,830
Oh my god!

1249
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:11,740
I thought I got them both.

1250
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,300
This is so... Oh my god.

1251
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:20,760
This is the most I have had struggled on a boss in this game.

1252
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,920
It's not just... It's like all the wins too.

1253
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,540
That makes it tricky for me.

1254
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,540
There we go.

1255
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,000
Okay.

1256
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,260
Please.

1257
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:49,880
Minky!

1258
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,500
Ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore.

1259
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:15,890
Can I dash into the electric eyes or will I die there?

1260
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:18,950
You can dog dash to... Oh, to dodge them.

1261
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,650
Yeah, the purple guy killed some of them.

1262
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,090
No, not into the electric.

1263
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:29,490
Okay.

1264
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:33,870
But I have to dash to get away from them.

1265
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,510
Don't like the dash.

1266
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:42,030
Minky!

1267
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:59,330
Minky!

1268
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,420
I just can't jump in mid-air at all.

1269
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,820
I can't jump in mid-air at all.

1270
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,120
Okay, okay.

1271
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,970
Oh, I missed the boat.

1272
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,620
I'm sick of this song.

1273
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,500
I'm sick of this song.

1274
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,340
Do

1275
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,330
it, Nankuu!

1276
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,890
I have to eventually.

1277
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,410
Well, I killed one.

1278
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,160
Minky!

1279
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,400
Please!

1280
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,560
Go away!

1281
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,780
You're scaring me!

1282
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,840
Oh my god.

1283
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,640
Oh my god.

1284
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:26,760
Oh my god.

1285
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,170
Minky!

1286
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:38,770
Minky!

1287
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:53,770
Let's rob the rest of this place.

1288
01:17:56,510 --> 01:18:00,470
Oh, what the?

1289
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,570
I don't think that's supposed to be like that.

1290
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:05,090
Wait.

1291
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,430
Is that how I get to the warp?

1292
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:23,910
Is that how we get to the warp?

1293
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,510
First try, boys!

1294
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,090
How

1295
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:36,350
do we figure out what the path is though?

1296
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:57,200
Turn around!

1297
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:57,700
Turn around!

1298
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:58,260
Turn around!

1299
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:29,980
Minky!

1300
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,640
We did it!

1301
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,360
First try!

1302
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,980
I can show you the world.

1303
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,640
Or a new world.

1304
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:59,980
I can show... Wait, it is a whole new world actually.

1305
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,660
Rocket.

1306
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:12,100
High suction hero.

1307
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:12,180
Hero.

1308
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,520
I mean, I have to.

1309
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:23,500
I mean...

1310
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,180
I'll take it.

1311
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,810
Give me my...

1312
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:34,450
Oh, they're coming for me.

1313
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:35,890
Oh gosh, they're coming for me.

1314
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:37,090
Where are they?

1315
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:40,770
Peggy!

1316
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:45,750
Peggy!

1317
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:45,850
Peggy!

1318
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:54,900
What's the elephant do again?

1319
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,980
Does it suck the water?

1320
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,820
Or is this the one that inflates us?

1321
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,480
I can't remember.

1322
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,360
Oh my gosh, we have concrete.

1323
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,040
Oh, interesting.

1324
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:12,800
OK, OK.

1325
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,140
Grab!

1326
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:18,500
Grab!

1327
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,140
A whole new Minto.

1328
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,840
A new rage to see.

1329
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:26,660
No matter where you go, a whole new Minto to see.

1330
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,080
I don't like these lyrics at all!

1331
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:30,960
There we go.

1332
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,500
Can I take the...

1333
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:39,240
Ksss, ksss, ksss, ksss, ksss...

1334
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,700
Ksss, ksss...

1335
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,420
You can make up the three platforms.

1336
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,040
Oh, really?

1337
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,560
OK, nice.

1338
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:57,620
Alright.

1339
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,860
Where are you guys coming from?

1340
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,800
Oh, that's right, he's sending them.

1341
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:09,080
I

1342
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,020
have to get more money first.

1343
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:27,810
I got you!

1344
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,750
Take my hand!

1345
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:36,650
Thank you boss.

1346
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:38,050
I got you.

1347
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,030
I would never leave one behind.

1348
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:43,310
Little birds.

1349
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,110
I think I messed up.

1350
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,890
I think I messed up, guys.

1351
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:52,710
Was there something inside the cave?

1352
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:57,950
I don't think there was, but I can check since I'm gonna be all the way back down here.

1353
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:03,130
Doesn't seem to be the case.

1354
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,710
We can get really close in person, although.

1355
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:06,910
Kinda fun.

1356
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,470
Lift!

1357
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:17,610
Lift!

1358
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:17,990
OK!

1359
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:26,110
Wait.

1360
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:32,540
Take me up!

1361
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,220
This one's fun.

1362
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,320
This one's a little silly.

1363
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,720
Because it's hard sometimes for me to...

1364
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:48,940
Big coin.

1365
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,440
For me to...

1366
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:50,720
No!

1367
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,240
Send me back!

1368
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:56,840
I'm sorry!

1369
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:06,970
Please.

1370
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,030
Please.

1371
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:11,850
No!

1372
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,510
It's right there!

1373
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:19,970
Should I restart?

1374
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,630
The save is so evil.

1375
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:24,530
I know!

1376
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:38,030
What

1377
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:47,130
the hell is that?

1378
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:50,430
Wannabe Psycho Mantis over here.

1379
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:55,990
I don't have anymore left.

1380
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,730
I'm empty.

1381
01:24:58,910 --> 01:24:59,830
That's OK.

1382
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:00,990
I think I'll just...

1383
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:02,490
What the?

1384
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:03,770
Excuse you.

1385
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:06,470
Yeah, excuse you.

1386
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,330
What is this?

1387
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,420
Who is that?

1388
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:27,820
The Glorp.

1389
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,560
That's his name?

1390
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,220
Is the Glorp?

1391
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,970
Hold on, Glorp.

1392
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:44,230
I gotta get some money first.

1393
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:51,400
Glorp!

1394
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,240
Militant Mutant!

1395
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,440
Helghan, red eye catches you.

1396
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:04,730
Don't freeze me.

1397
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:07,130
What's this?

1398
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:08,410
Oopsie.

1399
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,770
I'll just wait for it to... There we go.

1400
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,070
OK.

1401
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:26,010
This way.

1402
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:26,650
No, no, no!

1403
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:29,770
Oh!

1404
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,900
Holy moly!

1405
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:48,320
Glorp Snake.

1406
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,240
Is that his real name?

1407
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:10,770
I'm confused.

1408
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,050
How does this work?

1409
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:15,530
How the hell does this work?

1410
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,320
I

1411
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,320
don't think I have enough.

1412
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,500
I don't.

1413
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:36,440
I'm out!

1414
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,500
Sayonara!

1415
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,070
Oh, come on!

1416
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:01,370
Give me the big one.

1417
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,530
Oh, that was close.

1418
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,600
Wait, so does the cube give me Glorp?

1419
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,040
Does the cube give me eyes?

1420
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,540
No, I can't stop saying Glorp.

1421
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,720
Thanks guys.

1422
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,760
So the cube...

1423
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,420
OK.

1424
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,200
OK.

1425
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,240
Alright, look this way little guy.

1426
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:35,820
There you go.

1427
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,220
Yeah!

1428
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,060
I'm just worried that I'm not gonna have enough... What?

1429
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:43,900
I have to choose?

1430
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,320
Choose your fighter.

1431
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,560
Oh my god!

1432
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,600
There is the other puzzle piece!

1433
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,580
I'm worried I'm not gonna have enough puzzle pieces to complete the thing, you know.

1434
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,860
What is it?

1435
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,240
I can't tell what the lyrics are saying.

1436
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:06,400
SSP?

1437
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,460
Oh, I'm an idiot.

1438
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,180
Oh, SSD!

1439
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,000
SSD...

1440
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,960
You have to get every puzzle piece in the game to complete it?

1441
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:43,380
Oh...

1442
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,600
What is it?

1443
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,600
I wonder what it makes.

1444
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:54,490
Kill him!

1445
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:55,270
Nice.

1446
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:56,530
OK.

1447
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:58,570
Collect my money.

1448
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:01,070
No chance.

1449
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,070
Oh, welcome to membership.

1450
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,210
Thank you very much.

1451
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,930
Thank you.

1452
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:09,750
How the heck am I supposed to get that puzzle piece without actually killing myself?

1453
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:11,330
Oh, maybe with the stone.

1454
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,730
I hear something beeping, but maybe it's whatever the thing I'm on.

1455
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:21,770
Oh, there is a guy over there!

1456
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,070
Yo, this game...

1457
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:26,070
What?

1458
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,470
There is a guy right there.

1459
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:29,530
No!

1460
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:37,580
Oh, I totally mistimed that.

1461
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,860
Glorp.

1462
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,320
I can't tell which one I should go for first.

1463
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:25,020
Alrighty, alrighty, alrighty.

1464
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,360
Oh wait.

1465
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:30,260
I got it!

1466
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:30,900
Nice.

1467
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,620
Oh my god, oh my god, why did you jump like that when I...

1468
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:40,000
Oh,

1469
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,640
I messed up.

1470
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:58,600
Oh shoot.

1471
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,020
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1472
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:12,970
Guys...guys...guys, if I just fall...

1473
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:33,840
Nice!

1474
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,260
Why do you move every time I do that?

1475
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,300
Please don't do that.

1476
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,120
Your leg almost falls off the ledge every time.

1477
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,140
OK, OK, OK.

1478
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,560
We did it!

1479
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,620
Independent mutant.

1480
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:57,980
We are all individuals.

1481
01:32:59,620 --> 01:32:59,820
OK.

1482
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,460
Alright.

1483
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,100
OK, we gotta...

1484
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:06,380
This feels like a challenge level almost.

1485
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,120
Just came back from my birthday dinner.

1486
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:10,100
Wow, litter!

1487
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,780
Hope you're having a fun time playing the game.

1488
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:15,060
It's like PlayStation version of Super Mario Galaxy.

1489
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,620
Yeah, it is.

1490
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:19,460
I am having fun.

1491
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:20,100
Happy birthday!

1492
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:28,330
It's all the spinning.

1493
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:31,430
I know, it makes it so tricky.

1494
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,600
Holy moly.

1495
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:45,360
Oh, we're almost there.

1496
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:46,700
To the rocket ship.

1497
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,600
Oh my god.

1498
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:01,540
Why do you have to...

1499
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,320
Why do you have to do that?

1500
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,920
OK, OK, OK.

1501
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,200
Are the coins within the blocks?

1502
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,380
Yes, but I don't wanna waste...

1503
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,160
Well, maybe I should.

1504
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:15,620
Oh, I wanna get that coin.

1505
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:22,880
What if I need it?

1506
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,040
You know?

1507
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,380
Don't fall off.

1508
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:27,900
OK,

1509
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,010
nice.

1510
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:35,730
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

1511
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,440
Slurp, slurp, slurp!

1512
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:53,700
Slurp!

1513
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:54,920
OK.

1514
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:57,580
We did it guys!

1515
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,560
Oh hi!

1516
01:34:59,440 --> 01:34:59,780
Hi!

1517
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,500
You would have died in there.

1518
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,700
You're welcome.

1519
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:06,280
OK.

1520
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,560
Oh, I think we have a real problem here.

1521
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:20,380
Why are there so many cows?

1522
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,160
Why are there so many cows and aliens?

1523
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:25,980
What's going on?

1524
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:31,960
Are they OK?

1525
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:37,550
Destroy.

1526
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,270
Take money, take my money.

1527
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,990
Take my money, take my money.

1528
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:46,350
Up here.

1529
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,700
I'll take that.

1530
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:55,960
And slurp it up.

1531
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,060
Very good.

1532
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:09,110
Come on guys!

1533
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,430
Confused mutant.

1534
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,090
Which one am I again?

1535
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:14,830
Poor guy.

1536
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:17,870
Slurp.

1537
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,290
All of them, baby.

1538
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:34,650
Full 100% of the planet.

1539
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,530
OK, next one.

1540
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:41,410
No, not next one.

1541
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:42,450
Next one.

1542
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:43,910
No, not next one.

1543
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:44,510
Next one.

1544
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:47,770
No, not the next one.

1545
01:36:56,190 --> 01:36:58,350
Oh my gosh, I never want to go back there again.

1546
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,850
I never want to go back there again.

1547
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:05,130
I forgot that I...

1548
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:11,610
I did it 100%.

1549
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:22,080
I forgot that I missed that one piece.

1550
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,340
Oh, I thought you were being ironic.

1551
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:35,070
Should we go get it?

1552
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:35,530
You know what?

1553
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,870
I never want to come back here.

1554
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:39,850
We are going to get it, the one piece.

1555
01:37:41,170 --> 01:37:42,130
And we are going to leave.

1556
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:45,350
We are going to get the one piece and we are going to leave.

1557
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:46,950
We got this.

1558
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:48,250
Easy guys, we got this.

1559
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:57,590
We got this.

1560
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,750
The one piece!

1561
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:03,310
Just came back from the zoo and saw a bunch of cape penguins.

1562
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:06,190
The jackass penguin.

1563
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:09,490
Jackass penguin.

1564
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,050
Wow, oh my gosh.

1565
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:15,910
Look how beautiful it is.

1566
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:22,630
Can we take a second to appreciate the scenery here?

1567
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:24,290
So beautiful.

1568
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:27,130
And you know what?

1569
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:29,050
I'm getting more money, so...

1570
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,450
I guess it's not all bad, right?

1571
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:36,330
It's good to get more money.

1572
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:37,770
Oh shoot.

1573
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,450
We got him.

1574
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:51,290
Not that money.

1575
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:52,310
Ignore that money.

1576
01:38:52,570 --> 01:38:53,350
Too much effort money.

1577
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,390
Some money is worth too much effort.

1578
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:59,130
Some money is too much effort.

1579
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,310
We are speed running.

1580
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:02,290
A little bit.

1581
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:03,610
Kind of.

1582
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:07,090
I need more of this.

1583
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:12,270
Is this going to work?

1584
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:18,950
Yeah.

1585
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,150
Nice.

1586
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:23,330
And they grab more.

1587
01:39:25,570 --> 01:39:26,410
OK.

1588
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:28,350
Here we go.

1589
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:29,830
Money.

1590
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:30,450
OK.

1591
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:32,430
Big money.

1592
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:33,010
Big money.

1593
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:33,250
OK.

1594
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:37,350
OK guys.

1595
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:41,430
Yeah!

1596
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:45,640
Leave planet.

1597
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:49,700
Easy.

1598
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:50,520
Easy.

1599
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,480
Nice.

1600
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,260
There we go.

1601
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:55,720
Secret.

1602
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,900
Let's go back to the bird.

1603
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:06,460
Back into the bird and then we'll...

1604
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,820
What's that sound?

1605
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:10,740
Him?

1606
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,000
Is he going...

1607
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,200
Frozen meal.

1608
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:15,420
Oh my gosh.

1609
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,600
I used to love those though.

1610
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,960
Luna Sola.

1611
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:22,240
Oh.

1612
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:23,160
Oh.

1613
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:27,240
Lots to collect.

1614
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:28,960
There is a lot to...

1615
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,740
There is a lot to collect.

1616
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:31,240
Absolutely.

1617
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,450
The X challenge.

1618
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,510
Lost Cross Void.

1619
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,670
Later maybe.

1620
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:51,170
X X Formerly Twitter or something.

1621
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:56,330
Let's go to Frozen meal.

1622
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:02,570
We are going to get so much money so we can do lots and lots of gacha.

1623
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:06,790
But I don't want to like... Part of me is like I don't want to...

1624
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:11,810
I want to... I'm running into everything.

1625
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:12,450
I'm OK.

1626
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:15,970
Is I want to be able to... I don't want to like...

1627
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:17,190
Oh my gosh.

1628
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,490
I thought we were landing there.

1629
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:26,080
I want to be able to use any skins that I get.

1630
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:26,680
You know what I mean?

1631
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:28,420
Oh my gosh.

1632
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:29,620
This is perfect for Christmas.

1633
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,340
Oh no.

1634
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:34,920
My money.

1635
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,620
Surely these guys are kind.

1636
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:51,720
They are kind.

1637
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,420
Look at him.

1638
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,980
Look at the way he is mean mugging me.

1639
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,020
Turn around me.

1640
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,500
Don't wait.

1641
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:06,860
Why?

1642
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,080
What am I turning around for?

1643
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,520
Oh.

1644
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,180
Ouchie ouch.

1645
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:20,600
Those eyes aren't too kind.

1646
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:21,160
No.

1647
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:31,660
Little bunnies.

1648
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,960
The bunnies give me money if I kill them.

1649
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:43,540
Guys,

1650
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:50,790
I feel like I'm throwing.

1651
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,210
I gotta lock in.

1652
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:57,330
I gotta lock in.

1653
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,470
How do I use this thing again?

1654
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:07,920
Oh, there we go.

1655
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:13,630
Gifted soul.

1656
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:16,270
Has a not so imaginary friend.

1657
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:24,150
Give me more money little bunnies.

1658
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:26,770
The bunnies are filled with money.

1659
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:28,690
Oh yeah, you too little bunny.

1660
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:30,430
Give me more money little bunny.

1661
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:33,330
Look, you can even knock the snow off of here.

1662
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:34,710
Gosh.

1663
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:36,610
So much in this little game.

1664
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:39,530
David Cage game.

1665
01:43:42,210 --> 01:43:43,950
Why is it so fast?

1666
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:58,720
What's that?

1667
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,260
Oh, that guy.

1668
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:00,600
OK.

1669
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,180
Nice.

1670
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,180
My cat is so entertained by your gameplay.

1671
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:14,720
Really?

1672
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:18,540
Nice.

1673
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,220
I'll help you.

1674
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,040
I helped him and he gave me money.

1675
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:24,440
Oh my gosh.

1676
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:26,620
Everybody help people.

1677
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,980
They might give you tips.

1678
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,300
You know?

1679
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:34,020
If you help people, they might give you tips.

1680
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:43,570
Here we... Oh god.

1681
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:47,050
I should have expected that to happen.

1682
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:50,030
I'm good.

1683
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:51,230
Alright.

1684
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:54,230
And...

1685
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:55,550
Onwards!

1686
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:57,390
Oh, he kissed me.

1687
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,500
That was close.

1688
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,280
Nice.

1689
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,400
We call that a job.

1690
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,400
Hit the trees.

1691
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:14,500
Nice.

1692
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:21,100
You guys, for the first time I heard that song from the Lorax.

1693
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,640
How bad can I be?

1694
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:24,800
I heard that.

1695
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,000
I don't... I've never seen that movie.

1696
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:30,780
The Lorax.

1697
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:34,200
How bad can I be?

1698
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:34,260
How bad can I be?

1699
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:47,830
It's a fun song.

1700
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:48,790
It actually is.

1701
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:50,730
What's this?

1702
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:56,640
I got this.

1703
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,920
Oh no, I don't got this.

1704
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,060
I got this.

1705
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,420
Makes me feel like I should watch the Lorax sometime.

1706
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:12,860
I don't know.

1707
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:16,300
How bad can I be?

1708
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,820
All I said was skibbity.

1709
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,320
How bad... Sorry.

1710
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,480
Sorry, it has money.

1711
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,020
Sorry.

1712
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:29,620
Maybe next time you make a snow penguin, like, don't put money inside.

1713
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,400
People won't destroy it, you know.

1714
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:33,640
Look how we got some moves.

1715
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,260
Watched a bit of it on BR chat.

1716
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:39,100
What?

1717
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:40,760
How?

1718
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:40,920
How?

1719
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:53,560
All of these have such like crazy moving parts now.

1720
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:54,960
Oh my god, no!

1721
01:46:55,300 --> 01:47:00,280
I missed a tree?

1722
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:00,700
I did?

1723
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,500
I don't think I did.

1724
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,640
But I'll get all of them anyway.

1725
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:12,840
There we go.

1726
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:13,440
See?

1727
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:14,680
I got all of them.

1728
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,240
This still counts, right?

1729
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,640
I could do it for the money, but I don't feel like it.

1730
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:32,600
I will destroy this penguin's happiness, though, for the money, though.

1731
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:33,860
I'll do that.

1732
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,180
Okay.

1733
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:36,940
Alright.

1734
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,000
This one's a little tricky.

1735
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,560
Wait, I missed a puzzle piece near the start?

1736
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:44,480
Oh, I can't go back.

1737
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,300
Why didn't you say it at the start?

1738
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,130
I think that would've been easier.

1739
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:56,310
It's better for me to know.

1740
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:00,630
Oh yeah, I did miss one.

1741
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,290
Oh, we did?

1742
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:03,110
Oh, I didn't see...

1743
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:04,210
You guys, I'm playing the game!

1744
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:05,050
I'm not reading chat!

1745
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:32,410
I guess I could maybe restart now.

1746
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:38,450
This seems like a piece of doo-doo to get through.

1747
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:40,130
Oh, what the...

1748
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:41,350
Oh, it destroyed.

1749
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:42,070
I got this.

1750
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:48,270
Hmm...

1751
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:50,030
Yeah, spunky fetus.

1752
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:51,810
Should I just restart?

1753
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:55,910
It's the very beginning, you can re-enter and leave?

1754
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:57,030
Oh, okay, then we'll do that.

1755
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,030
Oh my god.

1756
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:02,230
Banana!

1757
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:02,610
BANANA!

1758
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:08,530
You need to do the level twice to 100% anyway?

1759
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:09,050
Oh, okay.

1760
01:49:09,650 --> 01:49:10,390
Good to know.

1761
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:16,920
No!

1762
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:17,760
This is evil!

1763
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:18,980
Leave me alone!

1764
01:49:22,810 --> 01:49:23,770
I got him.

1765
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:27,290
Stress.

1766
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:29,790
Stress, stress, stress, stress, stress.

1767
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:31,030
I've never felt so much stress.

1768
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:35,050
Yeah!

1769
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:36,550
Kill the people.

1770
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:43,410
Good job.

1771
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:43,890
Thank you!

1772
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:50,980
Oh...

1773
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:59,510
Dummies.

1774
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,900
I threw it though.

1775
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,900
What the heck?

1776
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,020
I threw it though.

1777
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:14,760
Double chunk chocolate...chocolate cookie.

1778
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:20,200
No, don't, don't, don't, don't come after me!

1779
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:25,600
Aren't you supposed to get tired or something?

1780
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,360
Where'd the other guy go?

1781
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,680
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO GET TIRED?

1782
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:39,920
Oh god.

1783
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:48,260
Ouch, ouch.

1784
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,460
I tried...

1785
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,160
Do I have to laser him while he's crazy active like that?

1786
01:50:58,530 --> 01:51:00,910
The other guy fell off the edge, which is pretty funny.

1787
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:02,490
Oh, see?

1788
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:04,410
Like I have to...

1789
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:07,150
I think I couldn't do it because I didn't have both guys.

1790
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:09,010
That's kind of right.

1791
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:10,010
That's kind of crazy.

1792
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:11,250
OK, throw!

1793
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:12,450
Nice.

1794
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:16,890
It's a little awkward.

1795
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:19,070
One second!

1796
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:21,890
Don't freeze me.

1797
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:23,570
Alright.

1798
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:27,630
The lasers work.

1799
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:28,790
They do.

1800
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:32,090
Let's eat all of this snow.

1801
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:33,010
What's this one do?

1802
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:36,110
Oh, it gives me money.

1803
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:37,670
I'll take it.

1804
01:51:38,030 --> 01:51:40,270
Can I explodey this guy?

1805
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:44,070
That was so close!

1806
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:46,370
I thought I wasn't gonna hit him!

1807
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,980
We can.

1808
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,080
Yummy snow.

1809
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:56,860
It looks so fresh and fluffy, doesn't it?

1810
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,600
It makes me want ice cream so bad.

1811
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:02,880
It looks so fresh and fluffy snow.

1812
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:15,040
OK.

1813
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:16,220
I see.

1814
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:18,540
I see.

1815
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,120
Run, run, run, run, run!

1816
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,060
Nice.

1817
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,960
No way, is that...

1818
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,860
Is that...what's his name from Robot?

1819
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:44,080
Is that...what's his name from the Robot game?

1820
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:49,300
Detroit?

1821
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:49,800
Yeah!

1822
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:55,190
Oh god.

1823
01:52:58,110 --> 01:53:00,910
How am I gonna get this money?

1824
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:04,170
Connor!

1825
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:06,950
How do I get to you, Connor?

1826
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,110
Connor...

1827
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:11,730
28 stab wounds.

1828
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,450
28 stab wounds.

1829
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:17,630
Connor, how do I get to you?

1830
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,260
Cut the ice around him.

1831
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,420
Oh, maybe that'll work.

1832
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:34,400
I'm just gonna...at this point I'm cutting everything.

1833
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,660
Oh, maybe over here.

1834
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:45,350
Can I redo?

1835
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,480
How is it still standing?

1836
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,560
You're making it hard...I'm not trying to!

1837
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:03,640
It's OK.

1838
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,020
Oh, it gives us...we just start from right here.

1839
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:06,380
It's OK.

1840
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:07,900
I think.

1841
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:08,720
I think it's alright.

1842
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:12,420
It was like the tiniest piece ever.

1843
01:54:16,810 --> 01:54:17,790
Oh my god.

1844
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:28,680
Come here, Connor.

1845
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:31,040
Oh my god, it really is him!

1846
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:36,600
Deviant Hunter, the droid that droids dread.

1847
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,760
28 stab wounds!

1848
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,000
Why couldn't they reference that?

1849
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:47,940
That would be so funny.

1850
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:49,340
Oh, bird.

1851
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:52,200
He's taking me out.

1852
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,720
In a good way.

1853
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:01,780
Oh my god, Mr...I was gonna say Mr. Krabs, but his name is Hank.

1854
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,720
Mr. Hank might be in here.

1855
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:10,260
Mr. Krabs.

1856
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,220
I'm not wrong though.

1857
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,540
I'm not wrong though.

1858
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:20,980
OK.

1859
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:22,000
Oh, oh.

1860
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:23,240
Timed.

1861
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,240
Oh shoot.

1862
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:24,620
OK.

1863
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:30,640
Yeah!

1864
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,100
Oh my goodness.

1865
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:34,020
OK.

1866
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:51,610
28 stab wounds!

1867
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,320
What the hell are those?

1868
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,280
Wait, these are the things that were over there.

1869
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,400
I don't know how to defeat these.

1870
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:11,500
Oh my god, please.

1871
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,040
Let me hit and destroy!

1872
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:22,000
My reflexes are sometimes on point, you guys.

1873
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:23,700
Oh no, I have to go back.

1874
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,960
Alright, we gotta get him up there.

1875
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,980
Can't you come down here, please?

1876
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:35,660
How do I use this?

1877
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:36,160
Oh, there we go.

1878
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:37,920
That was close.

1879
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:38,700
Hey!

1880
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,300
Put your slack in!

1881
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:45,600
He's fishing.

1882
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,280
How do I kill these things?

1883
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,020
Oh my god, he's staring at me.

1884
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:18,560
Let him do that and then run up and...

1885
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,340
Oh yeah, we did it.

1886
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:25,100
Alright, here...

1887
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:27,240
I can't jump.

1888
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,000
I just have to punch him.

1889
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,200
Yeah, just like that.

1890
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,120
Nice.

1891
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:38,040
What is this?

1892
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:40,920
OK.

1893
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:44,060
Nice.

1894
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,560
I feel like I'm... I mean... I feel like I've already missed another piece, you know?

1895
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,160
Wait.

1896
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:59,520
Oh my gosh, I gotta get a picture with the snowman.

1897
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:06,120
Oh, you're in love with me now, you freak!

1898
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:12,600
What is this?

1899
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,140
You're in love with me now, you freak!

1900
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,960
Oh, I didn't mean to take the picture.

1901
01:58:23,080 --> 01:58:23,360
L2.

1902
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,080
There we go.

1903
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:27,980
There we go.

1904
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:31,920
Now he hates me.

1905
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,060
I still feel like I'm missing something, you know?

1906
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:47,080
Hmm.

1907
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:50,900
Thanks for always being so cute and comforting.

1908
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:51,700
Thanks, Maika!

1909
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,520
Thanks for six months!

1910
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:04,760
That was so close.

1911
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:06,220
Oh my gosh, I see the puzzle piece.

1912
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:06,820
Nevermind.

1913
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:07,880
I see it.

1914
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:09,420
I see it, I see it, I see it.

1915
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:20,760
Jack Frost?

1916
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,080
More like Jack Freak.

1917
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,720
That guy's a freak!

1918
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:25,120
But we got the puzzle piece, so...

1919
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:30,120
All good in my mind!

1920
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:34,760
I could get more money.

1921
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:38,500
Pick!

1922
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:41,860
And... Yes.

1923
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:44,420
Yes!

1924
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,300
These guys sound so funny.

1925
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,300
They're like...

1926
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:56,720
Nice dodge.

1927
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:57,260
Thank you!

1928
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:00,920
We still haven't found the warp.

1929
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:03,960
The music up here is really nice.

1930
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:10,350
Do I kick it through here?

1931
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:14,570
Oh, up here.

1932
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:17,870
Wait.

1933
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:27,900
Wait.

1934
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:31,320
Wait, is it getting bigger?

1935
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:32,660
Am I crazy?

1936
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:35,020
Am I crazy or is it getting bigger?

1937
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:36,420
Excited for the concert?

1938
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:37,280
Thank you!

1939
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,360
Thanks, Aikai!

1940
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,080
It is getting bigger, right?

1941
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:45,570
Then I can hop on top of it, right?

1942
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:06,350
I have to go all the way here to get the secret.

1943
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:09,370
Hmm...

1944
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:11,270
The sock.

1945
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:15,430
Because we still have to take care of this guy.

1946
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:26,050
I have to get all the way back here.

1947
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:36,900
People are saying you have to... Yeah, someone mentioned it earlier too.

1948
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,460
It's just a matter of what I want to do first.

1949
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:41,320
You know what?

1950
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:46,660
We'll come back because we have to for the...

1951
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:52,260
We have to for the puzzle piece anyway.

1952
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:59,180
Choose number 3, my lord!

1953
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,160
Lost Galaxy!

1954
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:09,260
Is this the last one?

1955
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,660
Is this the last Lost Galaxy?

1956
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:13,500
Last Warp?

1957
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:15,240
Did I find all of them?

1958
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,660
Mushkash day complete?

1959
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:19,260
What's this one?

1960
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:20,980
Turtles in Trash?

1961
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:22,460
That's so sad!

1962
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,360
Why did I don't want to go there?

1963
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:30,760
Don't you want to go to the trash ridden world where turtles and sea creatures are dying?

1964
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,660
Isn't that the most fun level ever you ever thought of?

1965
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,160
That's so sad!

1966
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,500
Oh, you look sad.

1967
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,040
Oh yeah, see there was the last little guy.

1968
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,680
Alright, let's do it.

1969
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:49,200
So, where is said puzzle piece?

1970
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,240
Nice!

1971
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:12,980
There?

1972
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,140
Where?

1973
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,580
Snowman at the ramp.

1974
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,280
This guy up here?

1975
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:37,550
No way it was that easy.

1976
02:03:38,710 --> 02:03:43,910
No way it was that easy.

1977
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:50,700
Diabolical.

1978
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:54,880
Absolutely diabolical.

1979
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:57,540
What is this?

1980
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,280
Oh, oops.

1981
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:04,340
This game is craziness!

1982
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:08,020
I'm going to speedrun it a little bit.

1983
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:11,340
Oh, well, I said that.

1984
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:19,500
But I will also be collecting my riches.

1985
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:21,580
Hopefully.

1986
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,740
There we go, nice.

1987
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,900
I will also be collecting my riches.

1988
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:34,020
Ok, come on, take me up.

1989
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,900
Take me home.

1990
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:39,260
Don't kiss me.

1991
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:42,740
Country roads...

1992
02:04:43,660 --> 02:04:46,740
To the place...

1993
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:48,680
I belong...

1994
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:51,680
So if I had just seen...

1995
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:56,040
From right before that little slide, it would have been perfect.

1996
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,200
Oh my goodness gracious.

1997
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:01,080
How silly this level is.

1998
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,340
This part is difficult.

1999
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:05,040
I forgot about this.

2000
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:08,460
Why is this like the toughest...

2001
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,640
Why is this so tough?

2002
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:13,180
I hope you are having a great day, Mint.

2003
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:14,140
I am!

2004
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:14,720
You too!

2005
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,320
Thank you!

2006
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:19,380
Happy weekend!

2007
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,260
Happy...

2008
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:24,260
Weekend!

2009
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:30,000
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

2010
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:36,190
Spare no snowman.

2011
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:41,030
No snowman left alive.

2012
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,290
Oh, it did work!

2013
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:49,930
I see, I see now.

2014
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:58,940
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

2015
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,200
I love dynamite!

2016
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:07,260
Nice.

2017
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,920
And we'll take our money too.

2018
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,500
I'm rich?

2019
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:13,800
I don't know.

2020
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:15,760
I don't have that much gacha.

2021
02:06:20,420 --> 02:06:21,140
Nice.

2022
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:21,260
Nice.

2023
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,540
Alright, alright.

2024
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:27,140
We first timed it this...

2025
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,940
That guy...

2026
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,820
I always...

2027
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:39,180
You know what?

2028
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:40,420
Good.

2029
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,100
Good enough.

2030
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:44,740
That guy is literally teetering.

2031
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:47,280
Are you OK buddy?

2032
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:48,380
Are you going to make it?

2033
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,580
Is that why you are a dynamite gal?

2034
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,220
Alright, we got this.

2035
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:05,640
Hello?

2036
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,100
There we go.

2037
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,460
It still worked.

2038
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:15,680
Still worked out.

2039
02:07:21,650 --> 02:07:23,870
We are almost there!

2040
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:23,930
We are almost there.

2041
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:29,890
We are almost back to the spot.

2042
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,830
That was close.

2043
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:39,800
Nice.

2044
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:40,680
See?

2045
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:41,680
Speedrun.

2046
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,920
Speedrun everybody.

2047
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,780
Oh my goodness, I forgot about these guys.

2048
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:51,240
OK!

2049
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:52,840
Speed!

2050
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:01,400
Frigid for... Oh, I have to go inside your head?

2051
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:18,070
The music though.

2052
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:19,450
It's so crazy.

2053
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:23,270
Opposite way.

2054
02:08:23,370 --> 02:08:23,710
Opposite way.

2055
02:08:29,670 --> 02:08:30,950
It's so beautiful.

2056
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:32,770
Why is it so beautiful?

2057
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:36,350
Raiders.

2058
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:37,870
Thank you for the...

2059
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:40,930
Thank you.

2060
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:42,910
Sorry, I have to zoom in.

2061
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:44,630
Because it's white on white text.

2062
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:46,030
I don't know why YouTube is like this.

2063
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:46,610
It's so horrible.

2064
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:58,230
We are playing Astro Bot and I think I'll probably finish it today.

2065
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,290
Which means like finishing all the worlds.

2066
02:09:01,410 --> 02:09:02,230
Zaki, thanks for the gift.

2067
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:03,390
Yeah, screw you.

2068
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:05,310
Why are you so happy now?

2069
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:08,610
And that is another world, baby.

2070
02:09:08,810 --> 02:09:09,790
Another world!

2071
02:09:10,430 --> 02:09:10,990
K-5!

2072
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:12,290
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

2073
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:18,650
OK, alright.

2074
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:19,450
We got this one.

2075
02:09:20,730 --> 02:09:23,410
Oh, you sneaky little seal, you.

2076
02:09:24,330 --> 02:09:25,330
OK, OK.

2077
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:26,510
I get it.

2078
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:31,950
10 gifted!

2079
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:33,610
K-3, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2080
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:36,110
Damn, I'm late.

2081
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:36,870
No you're not.

2082
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:37,510
It's all good.

2083
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:40,130
Ah.

2084
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:41,950
Yay!

2085
02:09:43,970 --> 02:09:48,370
We have, I guess, 3 more and then the boss.

2086
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:50,370
Which is all the main worlds.

2087
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:53,590
I suppose maybe there might be one more after the boss.

2088
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:55,890
The boss.

2089
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:58,050
Crash, thanks for the 10 gifted.

2090
02:09:59,430 --> 02:10:02,190
I wanna go back home real quick and do some gacha though.

2091
02:10:05,110 --> 02:10:10,510
I want to get, maybe hopefully, a snake outfit if there is one in existence.

2092
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,960
245 out of 300!

2093
02:10:24,030 --> 02:10:25,230
Oh my gosh.

2094
02:10:25,570 --> 02:10:26,650
We're killing it, you guys.

2095
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:27,830
We're really killing it here.

2096
02:10:27,990 --> 02:10:29,050
Oh, that's wrong.

2097
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:32,410
What are you doing?

2098
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:34,230
Oh, there he goes.

2099
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:35,230
He was stuck!

2100
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:39,130
Help me.

2101
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:40,290
Help me, Minto.

2102
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:40,970
I'm stuck.

2103
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:48,890
We're also wanting Raiden Sword.

2104
02:10:49,330 --> 02:10:50,810
Little green men!

2105
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:53,610
Trust you as far as you can throw them.

2106
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:54,830
They're so cute.

2107
02:10:57,790 --> 02:10:58,310
Outfit.

2108
02:11:00,450 --> 02:11:00,970
Skelly!

2109
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:02,690
Nothing to hide.

2110
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:03,450
I kinda love it.

2111
02:11:03,450 --> 02:11:05,650
I think we'll change into the Skelly outfit after this.

2112
02:11:06,330 --> 02:11:07,170
What is this?

2113
02:11:07,230 --> 02:11:07,610
A door?

2114
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:08,430
Loading door.

2115
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:10,790
Cute!

2116
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:14,710
It's so cute actually though.

2117
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:19,230
Is that a golf club?

2118
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:21,650
Bunker, Buster and Ball.

2119
02:11:24,890 --> 02:11:26,510
Can't see under the skirt though.

2120
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:30,270
Fishy!

2121
02:11:30,270 --> 02:11:31,050
Rescued fish.

2122
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:35,850
Look at him with his stinking coin.

2123
02:11:36,930 --> 02:11:38,830
Was there a fish in Detroit Become...

2124
02:11:38,830 --> 02:11:42,630
Was there a fish in Detroit Become Human?

2125
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,760
In the very beginning.

2126
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:53,420
Is that an important part of the game?

2127
02:11:57,340 --> 02:12:00,080
We can become a rapper!

2128
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,320
Wait, it's so cute!

2129
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:04,840
Ok, nevermind.

2130
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,600
Ignore the Skelly outfit everybody.

2131
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:10,100
Wait, we got another outfit?

2132
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,440
My, what big ears you have.

2133
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,060
They're not that big.

2134
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,180
They're not that big.

2135
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,120
Another outfit?

2136
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:30,720
Guys, I think I have to be Ape Escape.

2137
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,940
I think I have to become Minky.

2138
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,320
Minky!

2139
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:35,880
Raiden!

2140
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,900
Raiden, come home!

2141
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:41,460
Raiden!

2142
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:43,960
I hate this game.

2143
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:44,460
Raiden!

2144
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:46,960
Wait...

2145
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:47,320
I

2146
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:55,270
was like, I think that's him!

2147
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:59,280
I think...

2148
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:07,000
We bought officially all the Metal Gear stuff in the game baby!

2149
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:12,320
Who wants a slice?

2150
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:15,460
Oh my goodness, I'm so happy.

2151
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:19,240
Restraint Remnants.

2152
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:23,500
Yeah, be free.

2153
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:25,540
Another outfit?

2154
02:13:31,780 --> 02:13:33,120
I could become a cowgirl.

2155
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:36,800
My soul is a tool of justice.

2156
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:40,640
Oh my gosh, so cute.

2157
02:13:40,740 --> 02:13:41,580
Hello Doki Bird.

2158
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:44,280
Come on!

2159
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,000
What's this one?

2160
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,600
Memory Recorder.

2161
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:56,200
Why does he look so distressed?

2162
02:14:01,570 --> 02:14:03,250
Royal Guardian and Fallen Fruit.

2163
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:05,530
Has stars in his eyes.

2164
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:05,990
Does he really?

2165
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:07,510
I don't see that.

2166
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:13,370
I wonder if there even is a Metal Gear outfit then.

2167
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:14,150
So sad.

2168
02:14:15,190 --> 02:14:16,250
He ran out of ink.

2169
02:14:16,430 --> 02:14:18,590
Oh OK, that would be a reason to be distressed, huh?

2170
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:22,170
That would be a reason to be distressed.

2171
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:28,270
Memory Recorder, thanks for the gift!

2172
02:14:28,470 --> 02:14:29,430
Let's go check out Raiden.

2173
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:54,900
The shell and all.

2174
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:02,880
Raiden is gonna be growing trees in his tummy.

2175
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:05,560
Raiden!

2176
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:06,040
Raiden!

2177
02:15:07,780 --> 02:15:09,320
He's like, I'm a fat boy.

2178
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:16,250
Oh my god!

2179
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:19,190
That was so silly.

2180
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:22,210
Who of two Wisps do you want to see fight each other?

2181
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:25,230
And why would it be a better fight than last night?

2182
02:15:25,790 --> 02:15:26,510
Last night?

2183
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:30,690
Wait...

2184
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:33,250
We only have two outfits left you guys.

2185
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:35,850
I don't think there's... What if there's no Metal Gear outfit?

2186
02:15:38,530 --> 02:15:40,450
What if there's no Metal Gear outfit?

2187
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:46,610
Last night was Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson.

2188
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:47,650
Oh yeah!

2189
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:49,590
I saw...

2190
02:15:49,590 --> 02:15:50,770
Oh my god!

2191
02:15:50,830 --> 02:15:51,650
I'm a monkey!

2192
02:15:52,990 --> 02:15:54,950
This is the best game ever.

2193
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:59,110
I saw nothing about it.

2194
02:15:59,770 --> 02:16:03,930
I saw a clip of them introducing Mike Tyson.

2195
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:06,030
What's this?

2196
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:08,170
Ah!

2197
02:16:08,590 --> 02:16:09,490
I think I remember this one.

2198
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:11,430
It looks so cursed.

2199
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:14,110
And like...

2200
02:16:14,110 --> 02:16:17,390
He like grabbed his crotch for some reason really aggressively.

2201
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:21,690
I saw the clip of his butt.

2202
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:22,670
His butt?

2203
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:28,260
Mike Tyson had his ass out.

2204
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,140
Fun fact about Dante Bot.

2205
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:36,320
He was originally supposed to be Leon Kennedy Bot.

2206
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:39,980
But the devs decided he was too silly.

2207
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:46,700
I believe you.

2208
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:52,300
Yeah, it looks like we got all the warps.

2209
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:55,500
It said 2 out of 2 so there's no other warps in this.

2210
02:16:56,640 --> 02:16:57,580
Thank goodness.

2211
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:00,120
Dive on in.

2212
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:04,460
I think today I definitely want to collect at least every bot.

2213
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:05,660
Oh no, sorry.

2214
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:06,260
That's a lie.

2215
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,380
Every bot from the main.

2216
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,800
Not from the challenges.

2217
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,900
Every bot from the main levels.

2218
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:15,580
I'm not a masochist.

2219
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:18,340
But you know...

2220
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:19,700
OK, anyway.

2221
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Charming though.

2222
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:35,100
I hear you!

2223
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:41,900
Minky!

2224
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:42,800
Minky rescue!

2225
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:45,180
Minky here for the rescue!

2226
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:53,720
I don't hear anything else.

2227
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:00,990
Minky rescue time!

2228
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:04,870
What is...what's this?

2229
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:12,070
Oh my gosh.

2230
02:18:12,190 --> 02:18:14,690
It's a time for the adults now.

2231
02:18:16,850 --> 02:18:18,710
Children, go to bed.

2232
02:18:18,850 --> 02:18:20,870
The pool is closed.

2233
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:25,290
This sounds very like Toy Story, doesn't it?

2234
02:18:26,310 --> 02:18:29,050
This feels like a Toy Story sort of level.

2235
02:18:30,730 --> 02:18:31,770
No, not yet.

2236
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:35,970
Oh my goodness.

2237
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:40,030
Wait a second.

2238
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:44,350
Wait, I want that bird to come back out.

2239
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:52,900
I'm trying to...

2240
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:53,840
Oh

2241
02:18:59,720 --> 02:19:00,880
my god.

2242
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,640
I'm trying to...

2243
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:17,320
I'm trying to hit him!

2244
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:18,380
Oh my god.

2245
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:19,500
OK, I give up.

2246
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:21,840
Oh, they're glowing.

2247
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,980
Girl, you are glowing.

2248
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:27,700
Who is that?

2249
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,700
I think we need it to be daytime.

2250
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:38,200
Oh, I have this thing again.

2251
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:42,100
OK, OK.

2252
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,840
We go up this way.

2253
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:46,760
I understand, I understand.

2254
02:19:48,660 --> 02:19:49,380
Oh no.

2255
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:51,440
Out!

2256
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:58,760
I was going to say, where the heck am I?

2257
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:01,780
OK, we got this guys.

2258
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:03,760
We got this, we got this.

2259
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:13,750
There's going to be more than you had to jump on.

2260
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:15,890
Papercraft Posty.

2261
02:20:16,390 --> 02:20:17,830
It has a very important message for you.

2262
02:20:17,970 --> 02:20:18,490
What is this?

2263
02:20:19,130 --> 02:20:20,490
Minto knows what she wants.

2264
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:23,190
Metal gear, I know.

2265
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:25,590
Tear away.

2266
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,240
Was there anything else with this?

2267
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:34,600
Any secrets?

2268
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:36,500
Any secrets around?

2269
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:38,900
I don't think so.

2270
02:20:53,070 --> 02:20:55,130
I hear someone else screaming.

2271
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:57,270
I think.

2272
02:20:58,270 --> 02:20:58,970
Maybe it's me.

2273
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:04,240
Maybe it's me.

2274
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,420
No, it's definitely not me.

2275
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:08,640
Oh my god.

2276
02:21:08,940 --> 02:21:09,700
In my face?

2277
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:11,740
Why would you do that?

2278
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:14,280
Miso gear everybody.

2279
02:21:16,860 --> 02:21:18,560
I think I just killed a person.

2280
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:21,100
Actually I'm not sure.

2281
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,580
Are you still alive?

2282
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:26,880
Which way do I go?

2283
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:31,240
OK, definitely not this way, but what if there is a guy over there?

2284
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:32,920
Yeah, there is a secret, see?

2285
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:35,920
There is a secret.

2286
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:46,140
No way!

2287
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:50,880
He's still... I still hear something, right?

2288
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:53,360
I think.

2289
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:55,160
I think I still hear a guy.

2290
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,600
I think.

2291
02:21:56,980 --> 02:21:57,560
Hopefully.

2292
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:58,580
Ah, see?

2293
02:21:58,980 --> 02:22:00,480
He was here the whole time.

2294
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:03,920
No, he's not gone forever.

2295
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:05,420
We got him.

2296
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:05,600
Wait.

2297
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:07,180
Yeah, see?

2298
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,580
I was actually stressing a little.

2299
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:16,000
Oh, this damn bird.

2300
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:18,000
Bait him and...

2301
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:20,840
Nice.

2302
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:38,050
Oh my god, please don't kiss me.

2303
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:38,870
Oh my god.

2304
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,890
We did it.

2305
02:22:46,950 --> 02:22:47,450
We got him.

2306
02:22:49,130 --> 02:22:50,530
Imagine if I just left him.

2307
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:53,590
Like, if I just not taking care of those guys.

2308
02:22:57,770 --> 02:22:58,730
Nice try.

2309
02:23:02,890 --> 02:23:03,850
Hold on.

2310
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:07,420
One second.

2311
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:07,900
One second.

2312
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,680
They gave me way more time than I thought they would.

2313
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:13,720
Oh no!

2314
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:14,400
Oh no!

2315
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:19,430
What's this?

2316
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:22,210
More secret.

2317
02:23:23,730 --> 02:23:25,650
And I can kill things from far away.

2318
02:23:26,770 --> 02:23:27,250
Nice.

2319
02:23:30,490 --> 02:23:31,370
What the hell?

2320
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:32,250
This is a new guy.

2321
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:38,450
And I'm not even going to give him the time of day to know what he'll do.

2322
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:42,550
I'm not even gonna give him the time of day.

2323
02:23:47,890 --> 02:23:48,370
Okay.

2324
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:51,730
So far so good.

2325
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:53,690
So far so great!

2326
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:55,310
So far so grand!

2327
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:55,790
Yeah!

2328
02:23:55,790 --> 02:23:55,990
Yeah!

2329
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:00,190
New guy more like dead guy.

2330
02:24:00,430 --> 02:24:01,270
So true.

2331
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:06,880
Call him out.

2332
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:16,330
Oh god.

2333
02:24:17,690 --> 02:24:17,770
I

2334
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:24,720
think that's everything.

2335
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:26,400
Wait, there's this here?

2336
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:28,120
Money?

2337
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:31,660
Lots and lots of it.

2338
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:33,020
I heard my name.

2339
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,420
Did you?

2340
02:24:37,480 --> 02:24:39,240
Thanks for paying attention to the stream.

2341
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,980
You sure did hear your name.

2342
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:46,700
In fact, I might call out your name any second.

2343
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:48,260
Look at their playing ball over there.

2344
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:51,020
I might just look in chat and be like...

2345
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:52,320
Rowlet!

2346
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,160
And then you have to pay attention.

2347
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:56,840
Kuronagi!

2348
02:24:58,660 --> 02:24:59,180
Pirate505!

2349
02:25:06,970 --> 02:25:07,910
That's cheating.

2350
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:08,890
How is it cheating?

2351
02:25:09,970 --> 02:25:11,110
I'm just telling you that...

2352
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:13,270
I'm paying attention.

2353
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:16,190
Or rather, you'll know if you hear your name...

2354
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:18,070
if you're paying attention, you know?

2355
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:20,210
What kind of dealio?

2356
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:22,310
It's like such a mystery.

2357
02:25:23,010 --> 02:25:24,450
Will Minto ever call my name?

2358
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:28,190
I gotta pay attention all the time!

2359
02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:32,270
It's kind of that sort of situation.

2360
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:33,610
Is all.

2361
02:25:35,190 --> 02:25:36,850
So I don't go the other way, right?

2362
02:25:37,770 --> 02:25:38,370
Bet.

2363
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:39,930
What do you mean bet?

2364
02:25:47,580 --> 02:25:48,180
Nice.

2365
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:01,000
How am I doing on puzzle pieces so far, guys?

2366
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:03,480
Today could be the day.

2367
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,240
Today is your lucky day, trash boy!

2368
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:08,820
She won't see me.

2369
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:10,440
I always see you, Shiro.

2370
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:13,240
I always see you.

2371
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:22,720
Oh boy.

2372
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:32,160
I was gonna say, this feels like that one thing when I was trying to get Raiden.

2373
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:34,460
Oh my god.

2374
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:36,960
Is that guy yawning or is he broken?

2375
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:39,700
Is he so sleepy he can barely keep his eyes open?

2376
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:41,960
Nice.

2377
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,760
I killed him, but I don't know how.

2378
02:26:57,930 --> 02:26:58,650
Ducky!

2379
02:26:58,810 --> 02:26:59,430
Oh my goodness.

2380
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:01,190
We look so happy.

2381
02:27:03,870 --> 02:27:05,310
Hold on!

2382
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:07,510
I'll get you!

2383
02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:10,530
I'll get you!

2384
02:27:13,930 --> 02:27:14,650
Somehow.

2385
02:27:17,910 --> 02:27:19,770
How do I... How do I get him?

2386
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:21,550
We are being perceived!

2387
02:27:22,450 --> 02:27:23,490
I am perceiving!

2388
02:27:25,790 --> 02:27:26,870
Oh there it is.

2389
02:27:26,990 --> 02:27:28,290
I just completely missed it.

2390
02:27:28,350 --> 02:27:28,810
That's so funny.

2391
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:34,730
The wire.

2392
02:27:35,210 --> 02:27:36,230
I didn't see it.

2393
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:38,170
Alrighty.

2394
02:27:39,570 --> 02:27:40,170
Awesome!

2395
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:51,260
Anything else around here?

2396
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:53,000
Where did that guy climb from anyway?

2397
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:54,560
Okay.

2398
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:56,040
This is such a silly level.

2399
02:27:59,720 --> 02:28:01,800
God, that scared the heck out of me.

2400
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:10,460
Oops.

2401
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:12,380
They're rolling, they're rolling.

2402
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:17,960
They're rolling, they're rolling.

2403
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:19,920
Oh, I missed it.

2404
02:28:20,580 --> 02:28:20,920
Hi.

2405
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:21,740
Hi Ducky.

2406
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:28,380
Big money!

2407
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:35,040
I feel like I'm stealing from their bank account when I do that.

2408
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:43,610
Nice!

2409
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:49,350
Got the puzzle piece and everything.

2410
02:28:54,030 --> 02:28:55,190
We'll get them this time.

2411
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:09,480
Clever, clever.

2412
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:11,460
This game is so clever.

2413
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:13,920
We're missing one guy and one puzzle piece.

2414
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,500
Alright.

2415
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:16,480
One guy.

2416
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:18,680
One puzzle piece.

2417
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:29,000
That was too close for comfort everybody.

2418
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:32,500
That was way too close for comfort.

2419
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:37,480
I think I just killed some guys.

2420
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:39,700
I think I just killed some people.

2421
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:42,280
I heard them scream as they fell to their death.

2422
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:43,560
So sad.

2423
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,120
Good job.

2424
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:46,740
Thank you.

2425
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:49,340
I think there's probably something down here.

2426
02:29:56,260 --> 02:29:57,020
Secret!

2427
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:14,440
Look at these guys.

2428
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:15,440
They're so cute.

2429
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:16,620
Low poly enemies.

2430
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:18,220
Oh no!

2431
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:19,300
I got you.

2432
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:20,920
After I get my money first.

2433
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,560
Where is my money?

2434
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:34,280
Where is my money?

2435
02:30:35,140 --> 02:30:35,700
Secret!

2436
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:39,740
Secret!

2437
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:44,440
Hello?

2438
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:46,440
Hello?

2439
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,620
Where do I go from here?

2440
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:50,900
Oh here.

2441
02:30:55,300 --> 02:30:56,300
I'm getting dizzy.

2442
02:30:57,100 --> 02:30:58,620
I have no idea where I'm at.

2443
02:30:59,460 --> 02:31:00,340
I have no idea.

2444
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:01,580
Here?

2445
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:05,860
That's a lot of money.

2446
02:31:06,020 --> 02:31:06,520
Hi!

2447
02:31:06,940 --> 02:31:07,460
One second!

2448
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:10,780
One second!

2449
02:31:10,980 --> 02:31:11,780
Let me get my money!

2450
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:13,500
Alright.

2451
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:16,280
And collect our little guy.

2452
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:23,740
No way.

2453
02:31:24,460 --> 02:31:25,560
Oh it's Sackboy.

2454
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:26,680
I thought... Wait.

2455
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:32,680
I thought... Is that the guy's... Is that the name of the little big planet guy?

2456
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:37,540
Is that the name of the little big... Yes?

2457
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:40,800
That's kind of messed up.

2458
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:43,640
They replaced him with this game.

2459
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:45,800
Knitted Kid.

2460
02:31:46,020 --> 02:31:47,180
Such a crafty little guy.

2461
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:48,540
Oh my god!

2462
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:50,980
I got all the stuff for the...

2463
02:31:50,980 --> 02:31:52,780
Oh, we can only go one way out.

2464
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:54,800
I got all the Metal Gear DLC.

2465
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,680
For little big planet.

2466
02:31:57,820 --> 02:31:58,700
In case you were curious.

2467
02:31:58,760 --> 02:31:59,580
If you're like... Oh no!

2468
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:02,420
I wonder if Minto knew about it.

2469
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:03,860
Of course I did.

2470
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:04,900
And I got it up.

2471
02:32:11,510 --> 02:32:12,390
Never doubted?

2472
02:32:14,110 --> 02:32:14,850
That's right.

2473
02:32:17,990 --> 02:32:21,210
Though I appreciate so many people will send me...

2474
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:25,050
They'll tag me in Metal Gear stuff.

2475
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:28,830
Even if I already know or something.

2476
02:32:30,890 --> 02:32:32,170
Oh coins!

2477
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:34,010
Money in the sky!

2478
02:32:35,170 --> 02:32:38,930
I just always appreciate you guys thinking of me and tagging me and stuff.

2479
02:32:41,370 --> 02:32:42,970
Money in the sky.

2480
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:45,490
I can go twice as high.

2481
02:32:49,570 --> 02:32:50,750
This is dangerous.

2482
02:32:54,500 --> 02:32:56,040
The Wisp Network.

2483
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:10,100
The sun comes up so fast.

2484
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:12,760
Rip.

2485
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,620
Rip the...

2486
02:33:17,540 --> 02:33:21,220
Rip to the poor salary man who's just like...

2487
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:22,360
Time to go to work.

2488
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:23,560
Time to go to sleep.

2489
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:24,740
Time to go to work.

2490
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:26,160
Time to go to sleep.

2491
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:31,080
This is how it actually feels like when you work like a job.

2492
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:34,520
Where's the last puzzle piece?

2493
02:33:35,820 --> 02:33:37,220
I missed it.

2494
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:42,140
Where could it be?

2495
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:44,520
Where was it?

2496
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:50,460
Too real.

2497
02:33:52,900 --> 02:33:54,240
Is it on the moon?

2498
02:33:54,380 --> 02:33:55,100
I don't know.

2499
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,360
Moon?

2500
02:33:59,320 --> 02:34:00,620
I missed it.

2501
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:05,160
Where could it... Where was it?

2502
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:07,380
Oh well.

2503
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:16,270
I don't think this is made of cheese.

2504
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:17,670
Oh.

2505
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:18,910
Oh.

2506
02:34:19,770 --> 02:34:20,510
Oh.

2507
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:21,510
Oh.

2508
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:21,970
Next!

2509
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,290
It was close to the last bot.

2510
02:34:27,510 --> 02:34:28,670
Dang it.

2511
02:34:30,290 --> 02:34:31,030
Dang it.

2512
02:34:31,790 --> 02:34:33,650
That was a pretty long chapter I feel too.

2513
02:34:33,870 --> 02:34:35,270
Pretty long level so...

2514
02:34:36,590 --> 02:34:37,470
It's ok.

2515
02:34:41,820 --> 02:34:43,300
Cannon brawl.

2516
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:48,320
This one does not have a lot of PlayStation characters.

2517
02:34:48,620 --> 02:34:49,400
A lot of normies.

2518
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:53,940
This is not what I expected.

2519
02:34:54,480 --> 02:34:54,660
Wait.

2520
02:34:58,360 --> 02:34:58,760
Oh no!

2521
02:35:02,890 --> 02:35:04,150
I still got it.

2522
02:35:04,630 --> 02:35:06,190
I still got it!

2523
02:35:06,810 --> 02:35:08,170
Thanks for 7 months!

2524
02:35:09,350 --> 02:35:12,430
I didn't get the money, but I got the...

2525
02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:18,990
I got the puzzle piece and I think that's all that really matters.

2526
02:35:19,950 --> 02:35:20,550
Shoot.

2527
02:35:21,970 --> 02:35:22,630
There we go.

2528
02:35:23,450 --> 02:35:25,410
Fade him and...

2529
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:27,220
Oh.

2530
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:29,440
What are these?

2531
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:42,260
Take him down?

2532
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:44,300
How much can I take down?

2533
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:48,600
Oh I have to make my own pathway.

2534
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:52,740
Was there going to be a Minto merch release next?

2535
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:54,000
Or did I misunderstand?

2536
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:56,120
No, you didn't misunderstand at all Riko.

2537
02:35:58,020 --> 02:36:00,180
You didn't misunderstand at all.

2538
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:03,600
I just have to...

2539
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:06,600
There's like a few things we're waiting on.

2540
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:07,820
Oh my god.

2541
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:14,900
What is this one?

2542
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,680
Oh this is when I can roll around.

2543
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:18,280
That's right.

2544
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:19,980
Minto still got it.

2545
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:21,100
I still got it baby!

2546
02:36:31,630 --> 02:36:33,170
This is not what I expected.

2547
02:36:33,570 --> 02:36:37,310
I thought we were going to have like a pirate ship thing going on.

2548
02:36:40,470 --> 02:36:40,950
Idiot!

2549
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:49,850
I might have gotten insta-karma'd.

2550
02:36:55,350 --> 02:36:59,930
I might have had a bounce of insta-karma there.

2551
02:37:01,890 --> 02:37:03,510
He'll run out eventually!

2552
02:37:06,530 --> 02:37:07,350
Yeah!

2553
02:37:07,610 --> 02:37:07,870
See?

2554
02:37:13,300 --> 02:37:15,250
I came in here at the perfect time.

2555
02:37:16,950 --> 02:37:17,770
Welcome.

2556
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:19,610
Thank you for dropping by.

2557
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:24,390
Guys...

2558
02:37:27,150 --> 02:37:28,750
Guys, am I too silly?

2559
02:37:39,690 --> 02:37:40,130
We're

2560
02:37:45,530 --> 02:37:45,970
fine!

2561
02:37:46,170 --> 02:37:47,190
Oh no, we're not fine.

2562
02:37:47,570 --> 02:37:48,370
We're not fine!

2563
02:37:54,120 --> 02:37:56,460
We're not fine, but we're fine at the same time.

2564
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:58,700
It's okay, just take it!

2565
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:01,400
Yeah!

2566
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,680
What is this song?

2567
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:21,080
Normal amount of silly.

2568
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:23,860
That's so good.

2569
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:27,180
Because my doctor said if I'm too silly anymore...

2570
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:29,520
That's the end of it for me.

2571
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:39,960
Oh.

2572
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:44,380
Alright, hold on.

2573
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:47,440
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to do this?

2574
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:48,080
Come here!

2575
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:52,480
Terminal silly syndrome?

2576
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:58,120
Wait, how the heck am I supposed to...Oh, I'm supposed to be a little ball.

2577
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:00,720
Duh.

2578
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:02,460
The gimmick of this level.

2579
02:39:03,580 --> 02:39:05,740
I'm supposed to utilize it!

2580
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:12,480
Yeah.

2581
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:13,480
Alright.

2582
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:14,740
Become ball.

2583
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:18,740
We're balling, we're balling, we're...balling?

2584
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:26,550
Is he gonna let go of me or...

2585
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:28,070
Or am I...Uh oh.

2586
02:39:29,770 --> 02:39:32,610
I'm like ripping my...

2587
02:39:43,270 --> 02:39:44,310
Oh my gosh.

2588
02:39:46,410 --> 02:39:51,010
Arc stone explorer has a tendency to see things in black and white.

2589
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:57,260
Your silly organ is depleted.

2590
02:39:57,820 --> 02:39:59,520
I'm running on silly fumes!

2591
02:40:00,620 --> 02:40:01,800
Is that Mr. Demon Souls?

2592
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:05,680
An honor.

2593
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:09,180
This is an absolute honor, sir.

2594
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:16,160
Uh oh.

2595
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:17,520
I saw it though.

2596
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:20,540
Oh no!

2597
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:21,000
No!

2598
02:40:21,140 --> 02:40:21,620
I got you!

2599
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:25,380
I need a silly transplant!

2600
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:29,480
It's getting...The diagnosis is getting worse and worse by the day!

2601
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:32,400
There we go.

2602
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:33,380
Okay, hold on.

2603
02:40:35,980 --> 02:40:36,420
Nice.

2604
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:41,900
Wait!

2605
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:44,440
I don't think I was ready to go...

2606
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:46,280
Nevermind.

2607
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:48,140
I had to go.

2608
02:40:48,620 --> 02:40:50,220
We were gonna go down with that ship.

2609
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:04,340
We were literally gonna go down with that ship.

2610
02:41:19,410 --> 02:41:21,170
Silly syndrome treatment fund.

2611
02:41:21,290 --> 02:41:22,030
Thank you!

2612
02:41:24,010 --> 02:41:25,170
What's over here?

2613
02:41:28,090 --> 02:41:28,750
Secret.

2614
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:34,610
Oh my gosh!

2615
02:41:35,330 --> 02:41:36,130
It's him!

2616
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:52,020
Wait, it's a Papa Pirate.

2617
02:41:58,310 --> 02:41:59,270
This one.

2618
02:42:06,950 --> 02:42:09,210
Ahoy, Papa Pirate.

2619
02:42:12,860 --> 02:42:13,560
Yay!

2620
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:17,300
You killed him?

2621
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:19,040
He was already dead.

2622
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:20,080
It was literally Skelly.

2623
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:21,100
Okay.

2624
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:21,740
Alright.

2625
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:22,200
Nice.

2626
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:24,180
We've gotten all the guys in a row so far.

2627
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:25,980
All of our little men in a row.

2628
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:28,840
Okay.

2629
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:29,960
Alright.

2630
02:42:30,260 --> 02:42:30,800
See you later.

2631
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:32,460
Rats.

2632
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:35,220
The rats led us to the destination.

2633
02:42:47,890 --> 02:42:48,430
Okay.

2634
02:42:51,630 --> 02:42:52,550
We're strong.

2635
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:53,130
We're strong.

2636
02:42:54,170 --> 02:42:55,130
We're strong.

2637
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:55,710
We're strong.

2638
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:57,050
Nice.

2639
02:42:58,690 --> 02:43:00,110
What's this bird doing?

2640
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:03,710
Do you have any things you wanna tell me?

2641
02:43:07,850 --> 02:43:08,610
I didn't.

2642
02:43:08,770 --> 02:43:12,050
I didn't think he was gonna release.

2643
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:19,560
Good evening, Mintonio.

2644
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,600
Good evening.

2645
02:43:32,650 --> 02:43:33,990
That is my name.

2646
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:37,790
That is indeed my name.

2647
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:42,760
Does fire happen in this?

2648
02:43:43,780 --> 02:43:44,560
Oh my god!

2649
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:48,320
Suck me up!

2650
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:50,680
Suck me up!

2651
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:56,340
I like this one because it feels like you basically become invincible.

2652
02:43:57,500 --> 02:43:58,200
Wait a second.

2653
02:43:59,260 --> 02:44:00,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

2654
02:44:01,360 --> 02:44:02,480
Oh shoot!

2655
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:04,240
What did I miss?

2656
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:18,160
You can still go back?

2657
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:19,160
I can't!

2658
02:44:20,220 --> 02:44:21,760
I can't go back.

2659
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,040
Oh no!

2660
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:26,980
Top of the crushers?

2661
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:28,040
What's the crushers?

2662
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:30,440
Oh, death by lava.

2663
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:30,820
True.

2664
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:31,700
Oh, checkpoint.

2665
02:44:32,060 --> 02:44:32,320
Alright.

2666
02:44:39,180 --> 02:44:39,720
Wait.

2667
02:44:44,480 --> 02:44:45,560
That crusher?

2668
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:47,400
Oh, I see.

2669
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:51,380
I wonder if I can roll back.

2670
02:44:57,650 --> 02:44:58,330
It's okay.

2671
02:44:58,590 --> 02:44:59,630
I will just continue.

2672
02:44:59,770 --> 02:45:00,390
I'll beat the level.

2673
02:45:00,970 --> 02:45:02,030
It wasn't that far.

2674
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:05,390
That's crazy because there is a checkpoint literally right here.

2675
02:45:06,030 --> 02:45:08,870
So they gave me a checkpoint even though they didn't tell me it's a checkpoint.

2676
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:11,330
It's a fake checkpoint.

2677
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:15,430
Suck what?

2678
02:45:17,230 --> 02:45:18,390
Suck on this!

2679
02:45:21,450 --> 02:45:23,090
Say hello to... Oh my god.

2680
02:45:25,110 --> 02:45:27,750
Say hello to my little fist.

2681
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:36,760
I think if I jump here...

2682
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:39,120
Yeah, like that.

2683
02:45:42,060 --> 02:45:42,640
Hold on.

2684
02:45:42,980 --> 02:45:43,600
Money first.

2685
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:45,180
Then help the people.

2686
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:50,280
I'm so salty!

2687
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,580
Can't believe I missed that guy.

2688
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:54,860
No, no.

2689
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:55,360
There we go.

2690
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:01,580
Wait, is this where I'm supposed to go?

2691
02:46:05,100 --> 02:46:07,040
I almost missed the puzzle piece!

2692
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:12,200
I thought I was finding the secret.

2693
02:46:13,640 --> 02:46:14,700
Oh my gosh.

2694
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:15,840
I'm walking the plank!

2695
02:46:18,200 --> 02:46:20,120
That was a close call, yeah.

2696
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:24,320
Matey.

2697
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:26,980
Hold on.

2698
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:37,760
I'm too scared.

2699
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:39,700
What if I...

2700
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:45,120
What if my little body is too heavy to sink to the ground?

2701
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:51,480
This is what happens when you double, triple, quadruple caress me.

2702
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:02,180
You guys wouldn't happen to be landlubbers, right?

2703
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:03,100
Because that would be awful.

2704
02:47:04,740 --> 02:47:05,700
Oh no, no, no!

2705
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:06,360
This is timed!

2706
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:09,440
My body!

2707
02:47:17,460 --> 02:47:19,860
You guys wouldn't happen to be landlubbers, would you?

2708
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:26,520
Why did it get so quiet all of a sudden?

2709
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:30,460
No,

2710
02:47:34,690 --> 02:47:36,090
Captain Short Fuse!

2711
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:42,580
I think I'm supposed to...

2712
02:47:46,440 --> 02:47:47,680
I'll just...

2713
02:47:58,520 --> 02:47:59,260
Got him!

2714
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:02,520
Oh, come on.

2715
02:48:02,600 --> 02:48:03,680
Oh my god, that was so close!

2716
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:17,480
Okay, we got that guy.

2717
02:48:18,300 --> 02:48:20,100
Okay, we'll wait for it to come back again.

2718
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:22,220
That was a close one for real.

2719
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:23,220
Holy cow!

2720
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:31,880
Dang it!

2721
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:35,320
If I just hadn't messed up that jump...

2722
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:38,100
I messed up the jump, it's my fault.

2723
02:48:39,700 --> 02:48:42,440
I didn't realize that they were going up and down so high.

2724
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:43,080
Okay, come on.

2725
02:48:43,740 --> 02:48:44,200
Come on!

2726
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:50,040
I'm gonna just wait here.

2727
02:48:57,500 --> 02:48:58,880
Did that work?

2728
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:05,160
Okay.

2729
02:49:07,700 --> 02:49:09,800
This will destroy at least one of them.

2730
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:15,760
Okay.

2731
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:18,140
Alright, I'm gonna wait again.

2732
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:20,760
Nice eyepatch, thank you.

2733
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:25,920
I'm no landlubber.

2734
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:30,040
And he comes again.

2735
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:32,280
Perfect.

2736
02:49:37,540 --> 02:49:39,960
Then I have to go back again.

2737
02:49:49,940 --> 02:49:51,040
There we go.

2738
02:50:02,760 --> 02:50:04,140
I'll be back.

2739
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:06,640
Oh, I should...

2740
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:10,840
That was gonna kill me.

2741
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:12,460
Wait, I missed two guys!

2742
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:18,640
I think there was a guy probably... I think that one guy actually probably died in that sinking ship.

2743
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:22,220
I think that guy died in that sinking ship.

2744
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:27,180
He was on the sinking ship?

2745
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:27,900
Oh no!

2746
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:30,820
We're gonna have to go through this all the way again.

2747
02:50:31,280 --> 02:50:32,120
Oh, that sucks.

2748
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:42,380
A captain always goes down with his ship.

2749
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:46,960
A captain always goes down with his ship.

2750
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:55,900
We should go back for them though.

2751
02:50:56,740 --> 02:50:58,440
We should go back for them.

2752
02:50:59,240 --> 02:51:00,960
You can quit after you get that guy.

2753
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:02,300
Yeah, it's so true, so true.

2754
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:12,580
More money!

2755
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:15,860
Thank you!

2756
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:26,460
Why pay money for help when you have chat who will help.

2757
02:51:27,060 --> 02:51:28,240
I believe you will help.

2758
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:30,440
Okay, sorry guys.

2759
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:32,060
Sorry that I have to do this all over again.

2760
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:33,600
Sorry.

2761
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:34,280
Sorry.

2762
02:51:36,220 --> 02:51:39,560
Alright, I'm just gonna do this for a bit.

2763
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:47,020
This should be good.

2764
02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:48,720
Right?

2765
02:51:48,940 --> 02:51:50,600
Why isn't it...

2766
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:01,260
We are the backseat kings!

2767
02:52:08,450 --> 02:52:09,050
We will...

2768
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:12,950
We will...

2769
02:52:16,050 --> 02:52:17,090
We'll just...

2770
02:52:20,620 --> 02:52:22,380
Speedrun to the location.

2771
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:28,560
See,

2772
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:34,700
he kills those guys.

2773
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:35,340
That's crazy.

2774
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:38,320
Oh, dang it.

2775
02:52:38,400 --> 02:52:39,140
I almost had him.

2776
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:40,860
I almost had him.

2777
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:48,220
I can still get him.

2778
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:50,500
For the money.

2779
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:57,540
I think it's like $2, but whatever.

2780
02:53:03,770 --> 02:53:04,450
Okay.

2781
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:07,350
Alright.

2782
02:53:08,390 --> 02:53:09,550
Where was it at again?

2783
02:53:09,630 --> 02:53:10,750
Not over here.

2784
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:20,340
Oh, I see.

2785
02:53:20,740 --> 02:53:22,420
Wait, there was starting at a big...

2786
02:53:22,420 --> 02:53:23,140
Oh, no.

2787
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:25,740
Oh, man.

2788
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:29,120
I missed my money.

2789
02:53:32,140 --> 02:53:33,820
Missed my chance on the big dollars.

2790
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:42,980
Okay.

2791
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:44,440
Alright, alright.

2792
02:53:44,680 --> 02:53:45,700
It's right here, right?

2793
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:46,900
Okay.

2794
02:53:52,940 --> 02:53:54,180
I hear him.

2795
02:53:54,380 --> 02:53:55,080
I hear someone.

2796
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:57,400
No, maybe it's me.

2797
02:53:58,580 --> 02:53:59,760
Is he inside?

2798
02:54:07,490 --> 02:54:08,590
No, I hear him.

2799
02:54:08,610 --> 02:54:09,890
I hear...

2800
02:54:12,070 --> 02:54:13,470
Above the crushers.

2801
02:54:13,930 --> 02:54:15,570
How the heck am I supposed to get up there?

2802
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:19,470
Oh,

2803
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:31,780
my god.

2804
02:54:31,900 --> 02:54:33,500
I don't like this angle very much.

2805
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:38,500
Okay, hold on.

2806
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:40,420
Maybe from here?

2807
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:44,000
Oh, wait.

2808
02:54:44,060 --> 02:54:44,400
That's right.

2809
02:54:44,460 --> 02:54:45,000
I can do this.

2810
02:54:48,860 --> 02:54:49,420
Is that him?

2811
02:55:02,880 --> 02:55:03,980
Oh, goodness.

2812
02:55:05,060 --> 02:55:05,500
Secret.

2813
02:55:15,140 --> 02:55:16,080
Oh, my god.

2814
02:55:16,580 --> 02:55:18,260
So glad that this thing is so sensitive.

2815
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:21,660
It listens so well.

2816
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:25,180
I got you!

2817
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:27,380
What the hell is this?

2818
02:55:28,740 --> 02:55:29,940
Nexus Dweller.

2819
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:33,280
If you got the souls, she's got the stats.

2820
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:37,940
Jane Demon Souls.

2821
02:55:40,880 --> 02:55:43,180
I had a feeling it was all the way up here.

2822
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:47,100
But I wasn't sure.

2823
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:53,460
Alright, now we just got to rescue.

2824
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,220
A poor little sap on a bridge.

2825
02:55:57,500 --> 02:55:58,260
On a ship.

2826
02:55:59,400 --> 02:56:00,760
And then we'll be good to go.

2827
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:04,240
My money.

2828
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:05,620
Okay.

2829
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:07,440
Are you still missing a puzzle piece?

2830
02:56:07,940 --> 02:56:08,560
I don't think so.

2831
02:56:08,580 --> 02:56:09,520
I think I got all of them.

2832
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:09,800
Yeah.

2833
02:56:10,220 --> 02:56:12,020
We got all of them for this level.

2834
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:13,740
I thought we did.

2835
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:17,440
He's over there.

2836
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:19,060
Somewhere.

2837
02:56:23,910 --> 02:56:24,890
He's in there.

2838
02:56:26,030 --> 02:56:26,510
Somewhere.

2839
02:56:28,210 --> 02:56:29,770
Just gonna take all this money.

2840
02:56:30,350 --> 02:56:31,070
Since we're here.

2841
02:56:31,210 --> 02:56:35,590
Actually, oh my god, how cool would it be if we walk the plank?

2842
02:56:35,810 --> 02:56:36,050
Wait.

2843
02:56:36,390 --> 02:56:37,310
Look at the axe!

2844
02:56:37,350 --> 02:56:38,150
That's so cute!

2845
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:41,710
We walk the plank into opening it up.

2846
02:56:41,790 --> 02:56:42,690
Watch this, watch this.

2847
02:56:46,330 --> 02:56:51,710
Just had a very minty mojito with my shrimp crepes in white wine sauce.

2848
02:56:52,150 --> 02:56:54,630
I finished with a bourbon toffee cake a la mode.

2849
02:56:59,310 --> 02:57:01,150
How do you know so much to cook?

2850
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:13,080
Kinki's always eating the best stuff, man.

2851
02:57:13,720 --> 02:57:14,740
I don't understand.

2852
02:57:15,300 --> 02:57:15,740
How?

2853
02:57:18,820 --> 02:57:20,000
Ok, here we go.

2854
02:57:21,180 --> 02:57:23,340
We won't rest until we find our son!

2855
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:25,460
Oh, there he is!

2856
02:57:28,580 --> 02:57:31,280
He was hidden amongst the jewels.

2857
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:34,980
We got him!

2858
02:57:47,380 --> 02:57:48,420
Time to go home.

2859
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:59,520
I think I need to get my eye drops.

2860
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,680
100% baby!

2861
02:58:08,700 --> 02:58:10,380
259 out of 300.

2862
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:11,400
That's crazy.

2863
02:58:12,140 --> 02:58:13,480
Oh my god!

2864
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:19,140
We're not going there just yet.

2865
02:58:20,260 --> 02:58:21,280
We're going here.

2866
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:24,160
Orbital blitz.

2867
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:28,040
41.

2868
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:30,180
I don't think we're going to be able to get all of them though.

2869
02:58:30,220 --> 02:58:32,420
Because I'm scared of the...

2870
02:58:33,780 --> 02:58:36,480
I'm really so nervous for the...

2871
02:58:37,060 --> 02:58:38,120
Oh my god, please.

2872
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:39,100
Please.

2873
02:58:45,640 --> 02:58:47,620
I'm scared for the challenge levels.

2874
02:58:48,440 --> 02:58:48,940
You know.

2875
02:58:49,880 --> 02:58:51,120
Is there something you get?

2876
02:58:51,220 --> 02:58:52,120
I don't think so.

2877
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:54,540
I'm not sure actually.

2878
02:59:02,960 --> 02:59:04,240
There we go, baby.

2879
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:08,280
I'm scared for the challenge levels.

2880
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:10,460
Mainly.

2881
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:13,680
I thought the... what's it called?

2882
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:14,380
Ran out.

2883
02:59:18,790 --> 02:59:19,550
What's it called?

2884
02:59:19,850 --> 02:59:21,010
The boost.

2885
02:59:21,450 --> 02:59:23,810
Which is why I was kind of silly with it.

2886
02:59:26,610 --> 02:59:27,550
But it doesn't.

2887
02:59:37,250 --> 02:59:38,250
I hear you!

2888
02:59:41,410 --> 02:59:43,670
There are some easier challenge levels you can do.

2889
02:59:44,970 --> 02:59:45,850
Yeah, but...

2890
02:59:45,850 --> 02:59:51,270
Oh, they're doing this thing up again.

2891
02:59:51,950 --> 02:59:53,590
If I can't get...

2892
02:59:54,450 --> 02:59:56,210
Oh, I think I need to hop over here.

2893
02:59:58,730 --> 03:00:00,670
Oh my gosh, that was so close.

2894
03:00:01,130 --> 03:00:03,590
If I can't get all of them, then it's like...

2895
03:00:05,310 --> 03:00:08,090
If I can't get all of them...

2896
03:00:08,090 --> 03:00:08,810
I don't know.

2897
03:00:09,710 --> 03:00:12,030
There is a reward for getting all the bots and puzzle pieces.

2898
03:00:14,990 --> 03:00:15,910
Prototype pilot.

2899
03:00:16,170 --> 03:00:17,630
With speed like this, who needs a weapon?

2900
03:00:19,690 --> 03:00:20,610
John Wipeout.

2901
03:00:23,830 --> 03:00:27,050
These trees remind me of that guy from My Hero Academia.

2902
03:00:31,110 --> 03:00:32,870
I hate that guy.

2903
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:34,790
He's so stupid.

2904
03:00:38,090 --> 03:00:39,530
That guy sucks.

2905
03:00:41,050 --> 03:00:41,730
The degenerate?

2906
03:00:41,810 --> 03:00:43,270
Yeah, but he's not even fun.

2907
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,720
I can appreciate a good degenerate.

2908
03:00:53,980 --> 03:00:55,760
Yeah, he even wears a diaper.

2909
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:58,060
He's so lame.

2910
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:01,660
Everything about him is so lame.

2911
03:01:02,340 --> 03:01:04,300
Oh my god.

2912
03:01:07,130 --> 03:01:07,530
Ah!

2913
03:01:13,180 --> 03:01:14,180
Just got here.

2914
03:01:14,240 --> 03:01:14,960
What is this combo?

2915
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:17,120
Have you ever watched My Hero Academia?

2916
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:21,720
The trees remind me of that guy with the hair that looks like grapes.

2917
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:28,620
I must confess that the meal was not mine.

2918
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:29,040
Oh.

2919
03:01:30,700 --> 03:01:34,140
I'm out for a concert tonight and decided to treat myself before it started in an hour.

2920
03:01:34,640 --> 03:01:36,740
Figured I'd watch you as much as I could before they started.

2921
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:39,140
Go enjoy your concert.

2922
03:01:39,140 --> 03:01:40,760
What are you doing?

2923
03:01:40,980 --> 03:01:48,120
Watching an anime girl play Astro Boy when you're about to...

2924
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:02,790
Cock-a-doodle-doo, baby!

2925
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:04,830
What does this one do again?

2926
03:02:05,650 --> 03:02:06,010
Oh, okay.

2927
03:02:06,030 --> 03:02:06,830
It makes us go up.

2928
03:02:08,030 --> 03:02:10,490
So I can get that.

2929
03:02:13,270 --> 03:02:13,810
Holy...

2930
03:02:13,810 --> 03:02:15,030
Express delivery.

2931
03:02:15,030 --> 03:02:15,170
Sorry.

2932
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,140
You'll never shoot me!

2933
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:25,300
Oh, nevermind.

2934
03:02:30,560 --> 03:02:31,880
That's embarrassing.

2935
03:02:33,880 --> 03:02:34,300
Anyway...

2936
03:02:41,630 --> 03:02:44,570
Guys, that was just a practice run, okay?

2937
03:02:47,970 --> 03:02:52,910
That was just a practice run.

2938
03:02:59,410 --> 03:03:00,190
Oh, shoot.

2939
03:03:00,810 --> 03:03:01,530
Ow, shoot!

2940
03:03:02,550 --> 03:03:03,230
Oh my god.

2941
03:03:04,650 --> 03:03:06,370
I didn't jump soon enough.

2942
03:03:10,230 --> 03:03:12,110
S.S.D.

2943
03:03:12,390 --> 03:03:14,890
They don't even do the normal spiky guys anymore.

2944
03:03:14,990 --> 03:03:16,230
They only do the extreme spi...

2945
03:03:16,230 --> 03:03:17,510
Oops, I forgot to get the other ones.

2946
03:03:17,730 --> 03:03:19,830
They only do the extreme spiky ones now.

2947
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:23,170
More practice.

2948
03:03:23,910 --> 03:03:24,430
Yeah!

2949
03:03:29,960 --> 03:03:31,360
S.S.D.

2950
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:32,400
Oh my gosh, I got stuck!

2951
03:03:42,070 --> 03:03:44,850
This game used to be such easy for babies.

2952
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:46,590
What happened?

2953
03:03:50,390 --> 03:03:54,650
Now they're like, oh by the way, we're gonna send three of these crazy enemies at you.

2954
03:03:56,070 --> 03:03:58,250
Oh my god, that one almost hit me!

2955
03:03:58,710 --> 03:03:59,890
How is that even possible?

2956
03:04:01,470 --> 03:04:01,990
Money.

2957
03:04:06,420 --> 03:04:10,180
I wonder if I can get them from below, you know?

2958
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:12,940
If I can go down here.

2959
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:22,240
If I can hit them from below.

2960
03:04:29,030 --> 03:04:29,730
What is this?

2961
03:04:32,770 --> 03:04:33,730
Space pups.

2962
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:41,340
315 bots total.

2963
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:42,200
Really?

2964
03:04:46,700 --> 03:04:48,080
Where's my guy?

2965
03:04:50,740 --> 03:04:52,760
I hear somebody.

2966
03:04:53,240 --> 03:04:54,400
Alright, we're gonna go for the green.

2967
03:04:57,920 --> 03:05:00,080
Nevermind, we're going for the red.

2968
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:00,200
Where is it?

2969
03:05:02,620 --> 03:05:05,980
I can't see anything.

2970
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:08,160
Oh there it is.

2971
03:05:15,990 --> 03:05:17,550
Where are you?

2972
03:05:18,710 --> 03:05:19,830
Where?

2973
03:05:23,010 --> 03:05:24,410
Is

2974
03:05:30,580 --> 03:05:32,300
he gonna fall?

2975
03:05:41,700 --> 03:05:43,860
What am I throwing this at?

2976
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:45,660
Something.

2977
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
Oh my god, I can't see anything, please!

2978
03:05:49,280 --> 03:05:50,300
What am I throwing?

2979
03:05:50,580 --> 03:05:51,680
That up there?

2980
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:54,200
Maybe?

2981
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:02,560
There.

2982
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:10,640
People bot!

2983
03:06:14,210 --> 03:06:15,490
Maybe I...

2984
03:06:16,370 --> 03:06:17,490
Do this.

2985
03:06:17,610 --> 03:06:17,890
Hold on.

2986
03:06:18,410 --> 03:06:18,950
Wait.

2987
03:06:19,950 --> 03:06:20,450
Hold on.

2988
03:06:20,450 --> 03:06:26,130
Maybe I do this and maybe I float on the ball to get out.

2989
03:06:29,390 --> 03:06:30,450
I think.

2990
03:06:31,230 --> 03:06:32,250
Oh, just use the chicken.

2991
03:06:32,870 --> 03:06:34,050
I think you're right.

2992
03:06:36,490 --> 03:06:37,350
I forgot.

2993
03:06:38,490 --> 03:06:39,610
You're so right.

2994
03:06:40,270 --> 03:06:43,670
I forgot that that's what he did.

2995
03:06:47,460 --> 03:06:49,360
Sweaty anti-grav ace.

2996
03:06:49,820 --> 03:06:51,960
A friend in speed is a friend indeed.

2997
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:56,660
Nice.

2998
03:06:58,220 --> 03:06:59,260
Hello pups.

2999
03:06:59,980 --> 03:07:02,860
Alright, let's see if I can get these guys from below.

3000
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:04,840
Watch this.

3001
03:07:10,430 --> 03:07:12,750
I think I might be a genius.

3002
03:07:13,530 --> 03:07:14,330
How do I get out of here?

3003
03:07:16,870 --> 03:07:17,910
Wasn't there...

3004
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:24,360
Yeah.

3005
03:07:33,570 --> 03:07:34,590
What is this guy?

3006
03:07:34,750 --> 03:07:35,930
Oh, I think I remember him.

3007
03:07:39,170 --> 03:07:39,690
Nice.

3008
03:07:41,370 --> 03:07:42,250
Nice, nice.

3009
03:07:46,110 --> 03:07:47,350
So smart, Minko.

3010
03:07:47,510 --> 03:07:48,190
I know.

3011
03:07:48,190 --> 03:07:48,290
Jump.

3012
03:08:03,720 --> 03:08:04,980
That's our thing.

3013
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:07,000
Oh no, no, no.

3014
03:08:08,640 --> 03:08:10,040
I don't like this.

3015
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:11,580
I don't like this.

3016
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:16,820
Alright.

3017
03:08:22,740 --> 03:08:24,560
Why are all these so difficult?

3018
03:08:27,760 --> 03:08:28,360
Oh my god.

3019
03:08:28,420 --> 03:08:28,780
No, no.

3020
03:08:28,900 --> 03:08:30,800
There's not enough space on here for you and me.

3021
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:37,240
Okay, I think we gotta take care of the alien first.

3022
03:08:38,300 --> 03:08:40,460
I think we gotta take care of the alien first.

3023
03:08:50,680 --> 03:08:51,400
Tricky guy.

3024
03:08:59,370 --> 03:09:00,650
Please, let me hit you.

3025
03:09:00,870 --> 03:09:01,070
Okay.

3026
03:09:01,530 --> 03:09:02,330
Alright, now we're good.

3027
03:09:03,090 --> 03:09:05,030
Now let him do his thing.

3028
03:09:05,670 --> 03:09:08,270
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

3029
03:09:09,850 --> 03:09:10,890
And... Okay.

3030
03:09:11,850 --> 03:09:12,130
Alright.

3031
03:09:17,190 --> 03:09:20,930
Oh my god!

3032
03:09:21,250 --> 03:09:22,350
There's a guy over there!

3033
03:09:22,830 --> 03:09:23,630
We missed him!

3034
03:09:25,930 --> 03:09:27,590
Good thing I looked.

3035
03:09:27,670 --> 03:09:29,010
Good thing I looked.

3036
03:09:32,950 --> 03:09:34,790
Oh, I can... Ew, ew.

3037
03:09:38,010 --> 03:09:38,510
Ew.

3038
03:09:38,690 --> 03:09:39,770
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

3039
03:09:42,250 --> 03:09:43,130
Oh my gosh.

3040
03:09:45,390 --> 03:09:47,110
Please, let me stand on you.

3041
03:09:47,750 --> 03:09:49,430
Oh, these are so nasty.

3042
03:09:50,310 --> 03:09:51,190
Oh my god.

3043
03:09:52,770 --> 03:09:53,730
I got you!

3044
03:09:56,350 --> 03:09:57,890
Oh, it's so gross.

3045
03:09:58,490 --> 03:09:59,410
Speed freak.

3046
03:09:59,830 --> 03:10:02,590
If you have the power, you don't need to be smart.

3047
03:10:06,530 --> 03:10:08,250
You can stand on me.

3048
03:10:10,670 --> 03:10:14,890
Oh, I forgot I have my... I don't think I need my eyepatch anymore.

3049
03:10:16,110 --> 03:10:19,130
If you have the freak, you don't need to be smart.

3050
03:10:21,130 --> 03:10:23,030
We just saved that guy's life.

3051
03:10:25,810 --> 03:10:30,850
How, though, do we do this part is my confusion.

3052
03:10:35,750 --> 03:10:37,790
Maybe if I jump...

3053
03:10:40,250 --> 03:10:41,050
Like that.

3054
03:10:41,210 --> 03:10:42,370
Did I get any of... No!

3055
03:10:42,970 --> 03:10:44,190
We missed a big one.

3056
03:10:44,690 --> 03:10:46,870
If I fall and jump again.

3057
03:10:46,930 --> 03:10:47,530
Let's try it.

3058
03:10:50,490 --> 03:10:51,690
I was greedy!

3059
03:11:06,200 --> 03:11:07,440
Do I have to do this again?

3060
03:11:07,580 --> 03:11:08,060
Okay, no.

3061
03:11:08,180 --> 03:11:08,640
We're fine.

3062
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:09,400
We're fine, everybody.

3063
03:11:22,210 --> 03:11:22,650
Okay.

3064
03:11:23,150 --> 03:11:23,430
Okay.

3065
03:11:26,390 --> 03:11:27,030
But

3066
03:11:31,660 --> 03:11:32,660
it's not doing it.

3067
03:11:33,260 --> 03:11:33,620
I'm not

3068
03:11:47,470 --> 03:11:48,930
close enough.

3069
03:11:49,530 --> 03:11:57,710
See, I'm trying to do this into this, but it's not working.

3070
03:12:01,430 --> 03:12:02,070
Am

3071
03:12:12,180 --> 03:12:13,320
I stupid?

3072
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:18,020
Use my lasers to get over here.

3073
03:12:20,660 --> 03:12:21,780
Oh, bye cow!

3074
03:12:21,780 --> 03:12:22,180
Anybody?

3075
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:24,820
Oh, yes, there was something up here.

3076
03:12:24,900 --> 03:12:25,300
That's right.

3077
03:12:29,220 --> 03:12:31,360
Which berry do I want to land on here?

3078
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:32,220
This one.

3079
03:12:34,320 --> 03:12:36,120
Look at the planet!

3080
03:12:37,280 --> 03:12:38,140
So cool.

3081
03:12:39,520 --> 03:12:40,580
You don't need it?

3082
03:12:40,620 --> 03:12:41,480
I do need it.

3083
03:12:45,900 --> 03:12:47,080
Oh, oh my gosh.

3084
03:12:57,310 --> 03:12:57,870
Okay.

3085
03:13:02,400 --> 03:13:02,960
Nice!

3086
03:13:06,140 --> 03:13:07,320
That was a good amount.

3087
03:13:09,220 --> 03:13:11,520
Alright, let's not get hit by this guy.

3088
03:13:19,380 --> 03:13:19,940
What?

3089
03:13:24,800 --> 03:13:26,400
You want me to jump up here?

3090
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:27,220
Got it.

3091
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:32,560
Okay.

3092
03:13:33,320 --> 03:13:33,900
Alrighty.

3093
03:13:35,400 --> 03:13:36,580
Now fall.

3094
03:13:36,760 --> 03:13:36,900
No!

3095
03:13:45,760 --> 03:13:46,880
We're safe.

3096
03:13:47,960 --> 03:13:48,460
Nice.

3097
03:13:50,080 --> 03:13:50,920
Checkpoint doko.

3098
03:13:51,140 --> 03:13:51,540
Right!

3099
03:13:52,440 --> 03:13:53,040
Checkpoint!

3100
03:14:00,700 --> 03:14:02,880
I didn't think I was going to make that for a second.

3101
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:05,160
Oh.

3102
03:14:07,120 --> 03:14:07,940
Oh my god.

3103
03:14:08,120 --> 03:14:08,480
Suck it up!

3104
03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:09,100
Suck it up!

3105
03:14:12,540 --> 03:14:13,880
How do I...

3106
03:14:16,180 --> 03:14:16,780
Fun!

3107
03:14:18,260 --> 03:14:19,600
Can I suck up the coins?

3108
03:14:19,940 --> 03:14:20,860
Suck up anything else?

3109
03:14:21,260 --> 03:14:22,120
Puzzle piece.

3110
03:14:28,360 --> 03:14:29,220
Nice suck.

3111
03:14:29,900 --> 03:14:32,220
Nice suck.

3112
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:33,840
Nice suck.

3113
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:37,780
Guys, we're like... We're in space.

3114
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:39,760
We're in space space.

3115
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:49,210
We're in space space right now.

3116
03:14:50,010 --> 03:14:51,090
What did that guy just take?

3117
03:14:57,700 --> 03:14:59,020
Just the corners?

3118
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:02,860
Nice checkpoint.

3119
03:15:03,860 --> 03:15:04,700
Nice checkpoint.

3120
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:05,700
Nice checkpoint.

3121
03:15:07,700 --> 03:15:10,100
That was so dirty!

3122
03:15:10,980 --> 03:15:12,560
That was so dirty.

3123
03:15:12,680 --> 03:15:13,500
Goodbye cow.

3124
03:15:21,280 --> 03:15:22,540
Oh I see them.

3125
03:15:23,300 --> 03:15:23,600
God.

3126
03:15:24,420 --> 03:15:25,740
I see them now.

3127
03:15:28,300 --> 03:15:29,200
You're a people monkey.

3128
03:15:29,980 --> 03:15:31,680
Yeah, I'm missile gear.

3129
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:42,080
I have to go get my eye drop soon in a second.

3130
03:15:57,840 --> 03:15:58,760
Oh gosh.

3131
03:15:58,940 --> 03:16:00,660
How am I supposed to get that puzzle piece?

3132
03:16:04,410 --> 03:16:05,830
How am I supposed to get this?

3133
03:16:17,210 --> 03:16:18,270
Fall and boost.

3134
03:16:18,870 --> 03:16:20,590
Yeah, it's gonna be...

3135
03:16:29,380 --> 03:16:30,260
Still count.

3136
03:16:30,920 --> 03:16:32,000
Still count!

3137
03:16:32,600 --> 03:16:33,820
So we still got it.

3138
03:16:36,540 --> 03:16:37,240
You know what?

3139
03:16:37,240 --> 03:16:37,620
It's fine.

3140
03:16:39,840 --> 03:16:41,500
It's still... It's fine.

3141
03:16:42,720 --> 03:16:43,600
I'm not gonna be greedy.

3142
03:16:53,980 --> 03:16:55,220
Go back for the coin.

3143
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:55,520
No!

3144
03:16:56,120 --> 03:16:56,820
I'm not greedy!

3145
03:16:58,400 --> 03:16:59,480
I'm not greedy!

3146
03:17:02,600 --> 03:17:04,020
It's one coin.

3147
03:17:04,880 --> 03:17:05,880
Oh cute!

3148
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:12,040
This game is...

3149
03:17:12,040 --> 03:17:17,760
I thought they were coming for me for real.

3150
03:17:27,480 --> 03:17:27,980
Yeah,

3151
03:17:31,630 --> 03:17:32,310
take that!

3152
03:17:37,780 --> 03:17:39,500
Does that say Asobi?

3153
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:40,240
It does!

3154
03:17:42,840 --> 03:17:44,020
How many are we missing?

3155
03:17:45,500 --> 03:17:47,200
Wow, we're missing quite a few guys.

3156
03:17:47,340 --> 03:17:48,380
And then one puzzle piece.

3157
03:17:49,100 --> 03:17:49,460
OK.

3158
03:17:50,780 --> 03:17:51,860
I messed up.

3159
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:55,220
I messed up.

3160
03:18:05,280 --> 03:18:07,520
Greedy Yoshi is not greedy anymore.

3161
03:18:08,060 --> 03:18:08,280
Why?

3162
03:18:08,380 --> 03:18:09,420
Do you want me to be greedy still?

3163
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:20,080
What's here?

3164
03:18:21,880 --> 03:18:22,900
I see you!

3165
03:18:23,580 --> 03:18:25,040
I see you!

3166
03:18:27,940 --> 03:18:28,800
Got him!

3167
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,020
Never be satisfied, Mito.

3168
03:18:36,640 --> 03:18:39,000
We want you to... Wait, 2 onions!

3169
03:18:39,140 --> 03:18:40,060
You're back to 2 onions!

3170
03:18:41,460 --> 03:18:42,580
You're not dead anymore!

3171
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:53,800
Wait, I missed two?

3172
03:18:58,380 --> 03:18:59,680
That's big news.

3173
03:19:03,860 --> 03:19:06,160
Oh my gosh, I see there's so much stuff over there.

3174
03:19:06,220 --> 03:19:07,060
OK, we're gonna go back.

3175
03:19:07,460 --> 03:19:08,140
Don't worry guys.

3176
03:19:09,580 --> 03:19:12,020
OK, we're fine, we're fine.

3177
03:19:13,020 --> 03:19:14,420
OK, we're gonna go back.

3178
03:19:16,320 --> 03:19:17,300
Top of the tunnel.

3179
03:19:18,040 --> 03:19:19,360
Top of the tunnel to him.

3180
03:19:21,820 --> 03:19:22,760
Alright, let's see.

3181
03:19:30,770 --> 03:19:31,870
OK, not that way.

3182
03:19:33,090 --> 03:19:34,150
I see one!

3183
03:19:36,370 --> 03:19:37,750
How the hell do I get up there though?

3184
03:19:39,950 --> 03:19:42,290
Oh wait, I think I go through...

3185
03:19:42,970 --> 03:19:44,450
I think I go through here.

3186
03:19:45,530 --> 03:19:47,170
Oh my gosh, no way.

3187
03:19:49,790 --> 03:19:50,150
OK.

3188
03:19:52,930 --> 03:19:54,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3189
03:19:54,350 --> 03:19:55,690
OK, let's get this guy too.

3190
03:19:58,290 --> 03:19:58,650
OK,

3191
03:20:02,330 --> 03:20:03,190
they both give me money.

3192
03:20:03,430 --> 03:20:03,930
Let's go.

3193
03:20:07,030 --> 03:20:08,590
Alright, so that's one guy.

3194
03:20:10,470 --> 03:20:12,390
OK, nice, nice, nice.

3195
03:20:13,870 --> 03:20:15,430
Nice, nice, nice.

3196
03:20:15,490 --> 03:20:16,490
And the other guy is right there!

3197
03:20:17,230 --> 03:20:18,030
We see him.

3198
03:20:23,410 --> 03:20:24,910
Good job team.

3199
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:27,010
Good job team.

3200
03:20:30,540 --> 03:20:32,200
But these guys...

3201
03:20:32,200 --> 03:20:35,220
Oh, I think I have to blast through the...

3202
03:20:36,100 --> 03:20:37,520
Oh my gosh, that was close.

3203
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:43,660
I think I have to blast through the top.

3204
03:20:44,960 --> 03:20:46,220
So I think I can just do this.

3205
03:20:50,430 --> 03:20:51,150
There we go!

3206
03:20:51,570 --> 03:20:52,190
We got him!

3207
03:20:55,350 --> 03:20:57,950
Future Racer, watch where you're aiming that super missile!

3208
03:20:59,530 --> 03:21:01,310
And then I saw that over there.

3209
03:21:02,310 --> 03:21:03,410
Oh, and lots of coins.

3210
03:21:03,530 --> 03:21:04,130
OK, let's go.

3211
03:21:08,620 --> 03:21:10,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3212
03:21:19,430 --> 03:21:22,230
Wait, it still counts that I got them though, right?

3213
03:21:23,090 --> 03:21:24,590
It still counts, right?

3214
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:30,720
Look at this happy jumpy...

3215
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:33,700
You son of a bitch!

3216
03:21:37,160 --> 03:21:37,820
No!

3217
03:21:42,680 --> 03:21:43,500
Got it.

3218
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:45,680
OK.

3219
03:21:46,680 --> 03:21:48,580
We are officially...

3220
03:21:48,580 --> 03:21:50,060
Good.

3221
03:21:50,480 --> 03:21:53,160
We are officially...

3222
03:21:53,160 --> 03:21:54,980
Good to go.

3223
03:21:56,660 --> 03:21:58,080
Never gets old.

3224
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:02,180
We're officially back on track, everybody.

3225
03:22:03,480 --> 03:22:05,400
Officially good to go.

3226
03:22:06,120 --> 03:22:07,360
Hot to go.

3227
03:22:08,200 --> 03:22:10,000
H-O-T-T...

3228
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:11,040
This one's gonna be a little tricky.

3229
03:22:11,680 --> 03:22:13,400
O-G-O...

3230
03:22:17,840 --> 03:22:18,680
Ah!

3231
03:22:28,530 --> 03:22:29,530
OK, nice.

3232
03:22:34,250 --> 03:22:35,250
Got him.

3233
03:22:36,130 --> 03:22:37,290
Thanks for the hot dog!

3234
03:22:38,390 --> 03:22:40,610
I think there's something just below this checkpoint too.

3235
03:22:41,410 --> 03:22:42,370
Is there now?

3236
03:22:43,490 --> 03:22:44,810
Is there now?

3237
03:22:47,570 --> 03:22:49,190
Good eye!

3238
03:22:50,250 --> 03:22:52,570
Super fly Dan Fry!

3239
03:22:52,570 --> 03:22:54,590
Good eye, for real.

3240
03:22:57,770 --> 03:22:58,890
Good eye.

3241
03:23:00,010 --> 03:23:00,510
No!

3242
03:23:02,270 --> 03:23:04,170
Oh my gosh, where is he taking him?

3243
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:11,480
Where did he take him?

3244
03:23:11,940 --> 03:23:13,160
Oh my god, he's up there.

3245
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:17,720
Nice.

3246
03:23:18,940 --> 03:23:19,740
First try.

3247
03:23:20,780 --> 03:23:22,460
And that's all our bots, baby!

3248
03:23:24,340 --> 03:23:26,460
Now we just need...

3249
03:23:28,320 --> 03:23:28,960
The...

3250
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,460
Now we just need the...

3251
03:23:47,280 --> 03:23:48,340
We're fine!

3252
03:23:50,680 --> 03:23:52,740
We just have one last puzzle piece.

3253
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:56,800
Which I'm...

3254
03:23:56,800 --> 03:23:58,560
Searching for.

3255
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:02,900
I wish...

3256
03:24:02,900 --> 03:24:09,220
I wish this game would allow you to go back to checkpoints once you beat a level, you know what I mean?

3257
03:24:09,220 --> 03:24:12,060
I think that's like the one thing...

3258
03:24:12,060 --> 03:24:13,420
That would make it perfect.

3259
03:24:15,880 --> 03:24:17,000
You know?

3260
03:24:22,870 --> 03:24:24,650
There we go, got it.

3261
03:24:26,390 --> 03:24:30,530
I think that's the one thing that would make it more...

3262
03:24:30,530 --> 03:24:30,950
You know?

3263
03:24:31,790 --> 03:24:32,250
Good.

3264
03:24:34,530 --> 03:24:37,270
100% the level first try!

3265
03:24:57,230 --> 03:24:59,270
Hold on, I want the money from it.

3266
03:25:00,810 --> 03:25:03,030
I want the money from it, there we go, okay.

3267
03:25:03,610 --> 03:25:04,050
Alright.

3268
03:25:07,230 --> 03:25:08,970
You had to say it.

3269
03:25:26,020 --> 03:25:28,340
Astro's playroom had that, I wonder why they didn't keep it.

3270
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:29,360
Hmm, I don't know.

3271
03:25:30,340 --> 03:25:31,680
I mean, it's...

3272
03:25:31,680 --> 03:25:32,860
The game is...

3273
03:25:32,860 --> 03:25:35,420
It's very generous with its checkpoints.

3274
03:25:36,520 --> 03:25:38,620
So maybe they figured...

3275
03:25:38,620 --> 03:25:40,500
It'd be fine...

3276
03:25:40,500 --> 03:25:44,640
But like, just to have it, so you can 100% things more easily...

3277
03:25:44,640 --> 03:25:45,220
You know?

3278
03:25:45,680 --> 03:25:47,200
That's why I would like it.

3279
03:25:56,410 --> 03:25:58,410
Look at him, he's ready to eat me up!

3280
03:25:58,650 --> 03:25:59,470
He's like...

3281
03:25:59,470 --> 03:26:00,910
Yeah, I got him though.

3282
03:26:03,410 --> 03:26:03,890
Stupid.

3283
03:26:06,390 --> 03:26:08,150
We got everything, yeah, okay.

3284
03:26:08,850 --> 03:26:09,610
What's up here?

3285
03:26:10,610 --> 03:26:11,630
Cool.

3286
03:26:14,650 --> 03:26:15,770
What?

3287
03:26:22,320 --> 03:26:23,440
Okay!

3288
03:26:26,020 --> 03:26:26,840
Alright!

3289
03:26:33,820 --> 03:26:34,940
Uberfo.

3290
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:36,500
Okay.

3291
03:26:37,640 --> 03:26:38,860
No, I don't like these.

3292
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:39,840
What the heck is this?

3293
03:26:42,960 --> 03:26:44,700
Am I supposed to like...

3294
03:26:44,700 --> 03:26:45,120
Do this?

3295
03:26:46,080 --> 03:26:46,920
No, oh wait.

3296
03:26:48,320 --> 03:26:49,840
When he does that...

3297
03:26:54,180 --> 03:26:55,620
I'm slow, I'm too slow.

3298
03:26:57,660 --> 03:26:59,020
Yeah, yeah, there we go, there we go.

3299
03:27:03,780 --> 03:27:05,200
Oh my gosh, there's so many of them!

3300
03:27:07,760 --> 03:27:08,480
And then...

3301
03:27:08,480 --> 03:27:09,960
Oh dang it, I'm too slow.

3302
03:27:10,420 --> 03:27:11,020
I'm too slow!

3303
03:27:13,760 --> 03:27:15,160
Oh no, I hit the bunnies!

3304
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:16,520
The bunnies scare me!

3305
03:27:17,860 --> 03:27:18,460
Oh my god.

3306
03:27:21,820 --> 03:27:24,160
They're kind of blowing up the bunnies though, which is awesome.

3307
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:25,280
Dang it.

3308
03:27:27,720 --> 03:27:28,080
No!

3309
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:29,520
No!

3310
03:27:33,170 --> 03:27:34,770
Oh my god, there's too many of them.

3311
03:27:36,310 --> 03:27:36,810
Hey!

3312
03:27:47,870 --> 03:27:49,370
Oh my gosh.

3313
03:27:51,950 --> 03:27:53,390
My hands are so sweaty.

3314
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:15,540
Let's go back home for a second.

3315
03:28:16,640 --> 03:28:18,160
How long have I been streaming for?

3316
03:28:20,520 --> 03:28:21,980
Oh my god, three and a half hours.

3317
03:28:22,380 --> 03:28:23,120
I love this game.

3318
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:27,320
It's so easy to just stream forever.

3319
03:28:27,480 --> 03:28:28,860
Wait, where did that shooting star go?

3320
03:28:31,520 --> 03:28:31,960
Hello?

3321
03:28:33,060 --> 03:28:33,980
Am I bad at games?

3322
03:28:34,040 --> 03:28:34,420
There we go.

3323
03:28:40,160 --> 03:28:41,980
Let's go back real quick.

3324
03:28:43,340 --> 03:28:46,140
And then we'll go here, dive on in.

3325
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:52,580
I know, there's puzzle pieces even on the map.

3326
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:55,060
I wonder how many we do need left.

3327
03:29:00,900 --> 03:29:02,280
Oh my god, less than 40.

3328
03:29:07,610 --> 03:29:08,910
One, oh nevermind.

3329
03:29:09,610 --> 03:29:10,430
I was gonna...

3330
03:29:10,430 --> 03:29:16,490
I think it's like all the way over there, so I don't really quite feel like going that direction.

3331
03:29:18,610 --> 03:29:19,210
Eye drops?

3332
03:29:19,270 --> 03:29:21,010
Yeah, I'm gonna get my eye drops in just a second.

3333
03:29:21,750 --> 03:29:23,850
And then I'm gonna... I gotta go to the bathroom too.

3334
03:29:26,030 --> 03:29:27,530
Federation of Falcon!

3335
03:29:28,270 --> 03:29:29,970
The pinnacle of European engineering!

3336
03:29:30,530 --> 03:29:31,770
Look at the little bunny, so cute.

3337
03:29:34,430 --> 03:29:35,230
What's this?

3338
03:29:38,910 --> 03:29:40,870
Oh my gosh!

3339
03:29:42,850 --> 03:29:43,390
Fridges!

3340
03:29:45,050 --> 03:29:45,970
Oh, sorry.

3341
03:29:46,250 --> 03:29:46,710
Yeah, you scared...

3342
03:29:47,550 --> 03:29:48,090
Cute,

3343
03:29:53,460 --> 03:29:53,980
cute, cute.

3344
03:29:55,320 --> 03:29:56,360
American heavyweight.

3345
03:29:56,600 --> 03:29:57,920
Barely defies gravity.

3346
03:30:02,240 --> 03:30:03,060
What's this one?

3347
03:30:05,860 --> 03:30:08,540
When all else fails, dodge roll.

3348
03:30:10,160 --> 03:30:11,480
Oh my god, look at him go!

3349
03:30:12,840 --> 03:30:13,940
He's so cute!

3350
03:30:14,220 --> 03:30:15,880
Do it again, do it again, please.

3351
03:30:16,420 --> 03:30:17,600
Go, go, dodge...

3352
03:30:22,810 --> 03:30:24,730
Oh my god, it's so cute.

3353
03:30:30,300 --> 03:30:32,220
Oh my god, it's so precious.

3354
03:30:33,080 --> 03:30:34,420
Oh my god, Nerissa!

3355
03:30:35,920 --> 03:30:38,000
Often mistaken for a raven.

3356
03:30:38,420 --> 03:30:39,380
Wow, she's hot.

3357
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:41,100
But she's not a raven.

3358
03:30:43,540 --> 03:30:44,560
Brazilian bullet.

3359
03:30:44,920 --> 03:30:45,320
Oh my god!

3360
03:31:00,510 --> 03:31:01,690
Knight's javelin.

3361
03:31:02,350 --> 03:31:05,090
This... Oh wait, you can throw this lance alive.

3362
03:31:05,850 --> 03:31:06,610
Get it?

3363
03:31:09,390 --> 03:31:10,350
So cute.

3364
03:31:10,530 --> 03:31:12,610
Yeah, we are interrupting something with that guy.

3365
03:31:12,970 --> 03:31:14,490
Oh my god, they all get their own little ships.

3366
03:31:15,150 --> 03:31:16,550
The future is now.

3367
03:31:19,890 --> 03:31:21,790
We don't have that many left in here.

3368
03:31:24,610 --> 03:31:26,130
A sibling spirit.

3369
03:31:26,650 --> 03:31:28,050
A literal party crasher.

3370
03:31:31,030 --> 03:31:32,690
It looked like there was nothing in there.

3371
03:31:32,690 --> 03:31:34,010
Oh my gosh!

3372
03:31:34,390 --> 03:31:36,470
We have the little gun.

3373
03:31:37,030 --> 03:31:37,710
Cute.

3374
03:31:50,140 --> 03:31:52,160
He's getting white girl...

3375
03:31:52,160 --> 03:31:54,460
White girl wasted up in here.

3376
03:31:54,960 --> 03:31:58,260
I didn't know that the astrobots were allowed to drink.

3377
03:31:59,020 --> 03:32:00,120
Wait, are we almost out?

3378
03:32:00,120 --> 03:32:01,480
Letter jacket.

3379
03:32:01,640 --> 03:32:04,040
It's a powerful personal message for its recipient.

3380
03:32:05,420 --> 03:32:06,780
We're almost out.

3381
03:32:09,300 --> 03:32:12,400
Even ghosts need to relax sometimes.

3382
03:32:12,580 --> 03:32:13,060
It's true.

3383
03:32:16,800 --> 03:32:17,540
Snake.

3384
03:32:18,260 --> 03:32:19,840
It's almost snake.

3385
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:20,620
Close enough.

3386
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:22,620
Ah!

3387
03:32:23,240 --> 03:32:24,240
A little big planet.

3388
03:32:24,680 --> 03:32:27,060
A little replica of a big planet.

3389
03:32:27,180 --> 03:32:28,740
That's so cute.

3390
03:32:29,740 --> 03:32:31,100
That's so cute.

3391
03:32:35,500 --> 03:32:36,700
And last...

3392
03:32:36,700 --> 03:32:37,460
Burning scepter.

3393
03:32:37,800 --> 03:32:40,460
This eternal flame burns for a warden of the Nexus.

3394
03:32:44,540 --> 03:32:45,100
Empty again.

3395
03:32:45,280 --> 03:32:47,220
Time to find more special bots or puzzle pieces.

3396
03:32:48,200 --> 03:32:48,520
Okay.

3397
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:51,120
Oh, puzzle pieces also gives us more gacha.

3398
03:32:53,880 --> 03:32:54,480
Interesting.

3399
03:32:54,480 --> 03:32:58,640
I wanna go see Mr. Death Stranding.

3400
03:33:04,380 --> 03:33:05,480
Let's go see.

3401
03:33:09,420 --> 03:33:10,700
Where was he?

3402
03:33:10,740 --> 03:33:11,340
Over here, right?

3403
03:33:12,540 --> 03:33:13,400
Oh my gosh.

3404
03:33:15,420 --> 03:33:18,820
Our planet is so bustling.

3405
03:33:23,840 --> 03:33:24,420
Sorry.

3406
03:33:25,420 --> 03:33:26,980
Look, he's going through the mud.

3407
03:33:28,340 --> 03:33:29,480
He's winking at me.

3408
03:33:29,960 --> 03:33:30,240
Baby!

3409
03:33:30,800 --> 03:33:31,900
Oh my gosh.

3410
03:33:35,690 --> 03:33:36,930
Oh the footsteps!

3411
03:33:37,310 --> 03:33:38,690
Oh my gosh, that's so cool!

3412
03:33:39,210 --> 03:33:42,730
Here they come, here they come.

3413
03:33:48,200 --> 03:33:49,800
That's so cool!

3414
03:33:50,600 --> 03:33:51,260
The baby.

3415
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:03,740
Cute.

3416
03:34:04,100 --> 03:34:05,220
What was that?

3417
03:34:06,120 --> 03:34:07,180
No hitting.

3418
03:34:14,500 --> 03:34:16,240
You can't tell me what to do!

3419
03:34:19,080 --> 03:34:20,000
There's so many.

3420
03:34:20,120 --> 03:34:21,420
Look at one of you guys!

3421
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:23,140
Okay.

3422
03:34:33,700 --> 03:34:36,720
Five Nights at Freddy's.

3423
03:34:37,380 --> 03:34:38,740
I learned something.

3424
03:34:39,700 --> 03:34:42,160
I learned that the last Chuck E.

3425
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:48,240
Cheese with real animatronics is in California.

3426
03:34:48,820 --> 03:34:50,080
28 stab wounds!

3427
03:34:54,110 --> 03:35:05,590
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28!

3428
03:35:08,070 --> 03:35:09,430
They still have some?

3429
03:35:09,650 --> 03:35:11,130
There's only one place left!

3430
03:35:11,630 --> 03:35:12,790
Only one Chuck E.

3431
03:35:12,930 --> 03:35:14,830
Cheese left with actual animatronics.

3432
03:35:15,390 --> 03:35:16,350
Isn't that crazy?

3433
03:35:28,690 --> 03:35:29,610
Oh, she's fine.

3434
03:35:29,910 --> 03:35:30,530
We're good.

3435
03:35:37,550 --> 03:35:37,990
Freaky.

3436
03:35:40,150 --> 03:35:40,990
Oh my god!

3437
03:35:41,990 --> 03:35:43,490
We keep sending them to space!

3438
03:35:46,030 --> 03:35:49,430
Okay, I'm gonna go get my eye drops and I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

3439
03:35:49,530 --> 03:35:51,950
So I'm probably gonna be gone for just a couple of minutes.

3440
03:35:54,750 --> 03:35:59,070
I prefer actual animatronics and they're not even like the moe-fied ones either.

3441
03:35:59,470 --> 03:36:04,990
They're like the real, original, nasty from the 80s animatronics.

3442
03:36:05,130 --> 03:36:06,250
They look so hideous.

3443
03:36:07,250 --> 03:36:08,070
I want to go!

3444
03:36:09,670 --> 03:36:10,770
I want to go so bad.

3445
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:12,770
Like in a goofy movie.

3446
03:36:15,190 --> 03:36:16,010
Stay hydrated?

3447
03:36:16,130 --> 03:36:17,490
Yeah, I'm gonna get some more water.

3448
03:36:18,370 --> 03:36:20,090
You guys can hang out by Snake.

3449
03:36:20,190 --> 03:36:21,710
Tell me if he does anything funny.

3450
03:36:28,490 --> 03:36:30,790
Tell me if he does anything really goofy silly.

3451
03:36:31,330 --> 03:36:32,310
Which Snake do you want?

3452
03:36:32,610 --> 03:36:33,050
This one?

3453
03:36:33,710 --> 03:36:34,390
Do you want Raiden?

3454
03:36:41,570 --> 03:36:41,970
Naked?

3455
03:36:44,590 --> 03:36:44,990
Naked.

3456
03:36:45,390 --> 03:36:46,890
Oh you can see all of them from here.

3457
03:36:47,330 --> 03:36:47,790
There you go.

3458
03:36:48,710 --> 03:36:49,410
I'm waving.

3459
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:52,650
Alright, I'll be right back.

3460
03:36:56,320 --> 03:36:58,200
Oh I can hear it from my controller.

3461
03:36:58,460 --> 03:36:59,000
Oh my gosh.

3462
03:37:01,860 --> 03:37:02,520
Crazy.

3463
03:37:02,800 --> 03:37:02,940
Okay.

3464
03:37:09,990 --> 03:37:11,310
I got

3465
03:38:30,920 --> 03:41:45,470
some jelly.

3466
03:41:46,110 --> 03:41:46,710
Raiders!

3467
03:41:46,930 --> 03:41:47,750
Thank you!

3468
03:41:48,230 --> 03:41:51,250
Sorry, I went to the bathroom.

3469
03:41:53,930 --> 03:41:55,390
Thanks for the raid!

3470
03:41:56,010 --> 03:41:56,370
Scatter!

3471
03:41:56,650 --> 03:41:56,830
No!

3472
03:41:58,290 --> 03:41:59,850
I got some jelly.

3473
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:10,200
What

3474
03:42:17,430 --> 03:42:19,030
flavor is lemon jelly?

3475
03:42:22,870 --> 03:42:23,630
Alright.

3476
03:42:23,630 --> 03:42:25,530
Alright, we died.

3477
03:42:26,030 --> 03:42:26,690
We're okay.

3478
03:42:27,250 --> 03:42:28,150
Did they do anything cool?

3479
03:42:34,840 --> 03:42:36,480
Did they do anything awesome?

3480
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:39,840
Alright guys.

3481
03:42:41,960 --> 03:42:42,460
Boner!

3482
03:42:43,360 --> 03:42:44,860
Oh my god!

3483
03:42:47,630 --> 03:42:48,130
Limpy!

3484
03:42:49,070 --> 03:42:50,950
So glad you're still streaming and thriving.

3485
03:42:51,350 --> 03:42:54,210
You have a great personality, hilarious laugh, and are a comedic genius.

3486
03:42:54,330 --> 03:42:54,790
Much love.

3487
03:42:54,890 --> 03:42:55,350
Keep it up.

3488
03:42:55,430 --> 03:42:56,630
I am the cutest streamer.

3489
03:42:57,210 --> 03:42:57,930
Thank you!

3490
03:43:01,810 --> 03:43:02,370
Wow!

3491
03:43:04,870 --> 03:43:06,290
Long time no see!

3492
03:43:06,930 --> 03:43:08,170
Thanks for dropping by!

3493
03:43:08,250 --> 03:43:09,010
Thanks for the super chat!

3494
03:43:09,790 --> 03:43:11,010
Return of the king.

3495
03:43:11,950 --> 03:43:14,130
Now a real celebrity moment right there.

3496
03:43:18,800 --> 03:43:22,360
I guess we do like this final...

3497
03:43:24,820 --> 03:43:28,100
This final battle and then we...Oh my goodness.

3498
03:43:28,880 --> 03:43:30,260
I'm not fast enough.

3499
03:43:30,600 --> 03:43:30,900
Please!

3500
03:43:35,430 --> 03:43:36,470
Nevermind, he's gone.

3501
03:43:36,890 --> 03:43:39,850
Maybe I do this final battle and then...

3502
03:43:42,290 --> 03:43:44,130
There's so many extra levels here.

3503
03:43:44,310 --> 03:43:45,710
We'll see what happens after this.

3504
03:43:47,510 --> 03:43:50,830
The raiders definitely weren't confused by the wall of blue $1 supplies.

3505
03:43:52,770 --> 03:43:53,830
Thank you!

3506
03:43:55,450 --> 03:43:56,290
Yeah, final.

3507
03:43:56,370 --> 03:43:56,970
I say final.

3508
03:43:57,070 --> 03:43:59,850
There's always like an actual boss after these ones.

3509
03:44:12,080 --> 03:44:13,000
Fat bird.

3510
03:44:16,400 --> 03:44:18,320
I hate these guys because I have to wait.

3511
03:44:20,960 --> 03:44:22,860
It's fine if I can just stand behind them.

3512
03:44:24,700 --> 03:44:26,640
Why does it sound so peaceful?

3513
03:44:27,400 --> 03:44:28,240
Fat bird!

3514
03:44:28,380 --> 03:44:29,020
Fat bird!

3515
03:44:29,020 --> 03:44:29,160
Fat bird.

3516
03:44:34,360 --> 03:44:36,100
Oh I'm a ball again!

3517
03:44:36,360 --> 03:44:36,760
Nice.

3518
03:44:39,780 --> 03:44:41,560
There we go.

3519
03:44:41,980 --> 03:44:43,520
A little worrisome.

3520
03:44:44,000 --> 03:44:45,120
Why do I need to be a ball?

3521
03:44:50,340 --> 03:44:50,820
Nice.

3522
03:44:57,500 --> 03:44:59,260
Angry Kiwawa noises!

3523
03:45:00,760 --> 03:45:02,160
I'm not...No!

3524
03:45:03,460 --> 03:45:05,400
It's good they are on the menu.

3525
03:45:07,080 --> 03:45:09,800
She wants some juicy and plump, right?

3526
03:45:13,160 --> 03:45:14,740
What is this?

3527
03:45:16,580 --> 03:45:17,560
That's fine.

3528
03:45:17,660 --> 03:45:19,500
We haven't had that before.

3529
03:45:22,760 --> 03:45:24,820
We haven't had to like reverse.

3530
03:45:25,200 --> 03:45:29,680
We haven't had to do this on something that wasn't an enemy.

3531
03:45:30,440 --> 03:45:31,700
I like it.

3532
03:45:33,560 --> 03:45:34,260
Chimpkin.

3533
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:35,380
Yeah, exactly!

3534
03:45:36,680 --> 03:45:38,580
Ok, it's just the one guy.

3535
03:45:39,660 --> 03:45:40,600
Surely we'll know.

3536
03:45:46,130 --> 03:45:47,530
Falcon McFly!

3537
03:45:48,050 --> 03:45:48,710
Oh shoot.

3538
03:45:49,650 --> 03:45:50,770
Oh nasty.

3539
03:45:54,200 --> 03:45:55,900
Oh god!

3540
03:46:01,780 --> 03:46:02,840
Oh my god.

3541
03:46:03,480 --> 03:46:05,920
I can't do anything.

3542
03:46:10,220 --> 03:46:12,020
Ok, nice.

3543
03:46:15,890 --> 03:46:17,610
There we go.

3544
03:46:27,070 --> 03:46:27,450
Ok.

3545
03:46:28,310 --> 03:46:29,070
More?

3546
03:46:34,010 --> 03:46:35,790
Oh I think I have to go to this side.

3547
03:46:36,050 --> 03:46:38,130
I just hear...

3548
03:46:39,470 --> 03:46:41,410
I hear...Ok, ok, I hear, I hear.

3549
03:46:46,420 --> 03:46:47,660
Oh my gosh!

3550
03:46:51,220 --> 03:46:51,920
What's this?

3551
03:46:59,330 --> 03:47:00,650
Oh my god.

3552
03:47:00,950 --> 03:47:01,870
This is craziness.

3553
03:47:05,210 --> 03:47:06,170
So gross!

3554
03:47:10,270 --> 03:47:12,530
Ok, don't be a ball for this moment.

3555
03:47:15,110 --> 03:47:16,030
This is bad.

3556
03:47:16,270 --> 03:47:17,030
This is bad, bad.

3557
03:47:25,140 --> 03:47:27,080
Oh I can do it while they're...Oh ok.

3558
03:47:27,360 --> 03:47:28,220
I thought I had to wait.

3559
03:47:30,180 --> 03:47:31,100
Ok, alright.

3560
03:47:31,560 --> 03:47:32,700
Let's go to this side.

3561
03:47:34,380 --> 03:47:34,940
Oh my god.

3562
03:47:35,020 --> 03:47:35,420
Nevermind.

3563
03:47:35,420 --> 03:47:36,120
Oh!

3564
03:47:39,120 --> 03:47:39,540
Ok.

3565
03:47:39,540 --> 03:47:42,880
Now I go to...I hear...Oh my gosh.

3566
03:47:46,300 --> 03:47:47,260
I hear it, I hear.

3567
03:47:57,340 --> 03:47:58,860
Two birds with one stone!

3568
03:47:59,760 --> 03:48:00,620
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit.

3569
03:48:04,340 --> 03:48:06,240
Yeah, kill those guys for me.

3570
03:48:06,300 --> 03:48:06,740
Thank you.

3571
03:48:10,870 --> 03:48:11,830
Thank you.

3572
03:48:18,230 --> 03:48:19,650
Oh my god, no!

3573
03:48:20,210 --> 03:48:20,810
It didn't work.

3574
03:48:21,190 --> 03:48:21,570
Why not?

3575
03:48:23,810 --> 03:48:24,510
You know what?

3576
03:48:24,510 --> 03:48:25,410
I'm just gonna run to it.

3577
03:48:29,060 --> 03:48:30,300
I'll just die, right?

3578
03:48:32,300 --> 03:48:32,780
Ok.

3579
03:48:33,720 --> 03:48:35,920
I think I need to be...Alright.

3580
03:48:37,000 --> 03:48:38,000
Oh, nevermind.

3581
03:48:38,700 --> 03:48:40,120
Alright, become ball.

3582
03:48:41,060 --> 03:48:41,900
Yeah, he's angry.

3583
03:48:42,220 --> 03:48:42,900
Oh no, no, no, no.

3584
03:48:43,420 --> 03:48:44,660
Oh gosh.

3585
03:48:45,020 --> 03:48:46,140
Ok, not be a ball here.

3586
03:48:47,260 --> 03:48:48,260
Alright, alright.

3587
03:48:48,360 --> 03:48:48,940
Nice, nice, nice.

3588
03:48:49,780 --> 03:48:50,460
Ok, oh.

3589
03:48:51,940 --> 03:48:53,400
Oh my god!

3590
03:48:54,640 --> 03:48:57,240
Why do you have all these guys in your beak?

3591
03:48:57,580 --> 03:48:58,660
Or why you...

3592
03:48:59,620 --> 03:49:01,860
Why are all these guys in your stomach?

3593
03:49:02,000 --> 03:49:03,800
Why do you have all your family in here?

3594
03:49:04,200 --> 03:49:04,920
I'm confused.

3595
03:49:10,070 --> 03:49:10,910
Oh shoot.

3596
03:49:23,400 --> 03:49:24,720
That was so close.

3597
03:49:27,700 --> 03:49:28,260
Nice!

3598
03:49:30,880 --> 03:49:31,760
Nice, nice.

3599
03:49:32,460 --> 03:49:32,680
Ok.

3600
03:49:34,780 --> 03:49:35,340
Ok.

3601
03:49:35,840 --> 03:49:37,420
We're going, we're going, we're going, we're going.

3602
03:49:46,520 --> 03:49:47,640
You laid

3603
03:49:55,440 --> 03:49:57,580
an egg in your distress.

3604
03:49:58,000 --> 03:49:58,780
You laid an egg.

3605
03:50:00,700 --> 03:50:01,500
Who is it?

3606
03:50:04,800 --> 03:50:05,700
Who is this?

3607
03:50:08,120 --> 03:50:08,480
Who?

3608
03:50:15,290 --> 03:50:18,230
What an irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road, right?

3609
03:50:18,390 --> 03:50:19,890
Oh my god, my eye drops did nothing.

3610
03:50:20,690 --> 03:50:21,130
Sucks.

3611
03:50:23,830 --> 03:50:24,870
I guess we just leave.

3612
03:50:25,970 --> 03:50:28,650
I think my chat is frozen.

3613
03:50:28,750 --> 03:50:29,090
One second.

3614
03:50:37,840 --> 03:50:39,820
This is... What's it called?

3615
03:50:40,140 --> 03:50:40,700
What's that?

3616
03:50:40,800 --> 03:50:41,140
What's that?

3617
03:50:41,220 --> 03:50:41,660
What's that?

3618
03:50:44,560 --> 03:50:45,820
I know this one.

3619
03:50:46,960 --> 03:50:48,400
I don't remember what it's called though.

3620
03:50:48,480 --> 03:50:48,980
Horizon!

3621
03:50:49,440 --> 03:50:49,920
Thank you.

3622
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:51,140
One sec.

3623
03:50:51,280 --> 03:50:52,500
Oh, YouTube is all frozen.

3624
03:50:54,020 --> 03:50:56,860
This happens to me every stream.

3625
03:50:57,400 --> 03:50:58,480
All the time.

3626
03:50:58,980 --> 03:51:00,160
My YouTube freezes.

3627
03:51:00,360 --> 03:51:01,620
Every day.

3628
03:51:02,200 --> 03:51:02,980
Every time.

3629
03:51:02,980 --> 03:51:06,400
It's not like I'm supposed to be a professional out here.

3630
03:51:06,520 --> 03:51:06,720
No.

3631
03:51:10,640 --> 03:51:12,480
Just screwing up always.

3632
03:51:15,420 --> 03:51:17,120
Making an utter fool of myself.

3633
03:51:17,240 --> 03:51:18,160
Oh my god, you guys.

3634
03:51:19,280 --> 03:51:22,580
My videos have hit 10 million views.

3635
03:51:23,640 --> 03:51:24,160
Yippee!

3636
03:51:24,160 --> 03:51:24,680
Thanks.

3637
03:51:26,540 --> 03:51:27,760
Thank you, thank you.

3638
03:51:28,680 --> 03:51:30,120
Alright, we got the chat back.

3639
03:51:30,980 --> 03:51:32,640
Wowee, that's a lot of views.

3640
03:51:34,480 --> 03:51:38,160
Okay, here we go to this world.

3641
03:51:38,980 --> 03:51:40,220
Machine learning.

3642
03:51:40,540 --> 03:51:41,180
Let's go in.

3643
03:51:41,280 --> 03:51:42,380
Wow, it's so cute.

3644
03:51:49,140 --> 03:51:50,120
10 million.

3645
03:51:54,780 --> 03:51:55,980
Bonk, bonk.

3646
03:51:58,600 --> 03:52:00,780
No, I missed it.

3647
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:05,640
Restart.

3648
03:52:08,180 --> 03:52:11,720
I'm just gonna boost the entire way.

3649
03:52:13,900 --> 03:52:14,540
Ouch.

3650
03:52:14,940 --> 03:52:15,320
It's okay.

3651
03:52:18,000 --> 03:52:18,720
Nice.

3652
03:52:19,800 --> 03:52:20,280
We got it.

3653
03:52:22,800 --> 03:52:23,840
Thank you.

3654
03:52:26,220 --> 03:52:28,900
Look how cute it is.

3655
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:29,800
Oh my gosh.

3656
03:52:30,800 --> 03:52:32,560
So beautiful, so majestic.

3657
03:52:33,380 --> 03:52:34,360
Is Horizon any good?

3658
03:52:39,500 --> 03:52:42,960
It's like they give a couple of the...

3659
03:52:42,960 --> 03:52:43,540
Oh, hello.

3660
03:52:45,340 --> 03:52:46,280
It's alright.

3661
03:52:47,360 --> 03:52:49,140
They give like some...

3662
03:52:49,140 --> 03:52:51,560
some worlds like...

3663
03:52:51,560 --> 03:52:55,460
special, you know, like some properties a special world.

3664
03:52:55,760 --> 03:52:57,500
The other one we had was...

3665
03:52:58,520 --> 03:52:59,580
My boy.

3666
03:53:00,900 --> 03:53:01,940
My boy.

3667
03:53:02,340 --> 03:53:02,780
Oh wait.

3668
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:03,800
Oh my gosh.

3669
03:53:04,300 --> 03:53:04,680
Awesome.

3670
03:53:06,820 --> 03:53:08,200
Oh, I have to aim?

3671
03:53:11,260 --> 03:53:12,640
Oh, hell yeah.

3672
03:53:13,880 --> 03:53:15,960
We have distance now.

3673
03:53:16,760 --> 03:53:17,140
Nice.

3674
03:53:19,620 --> 03:53:20,240
Wow.

3675
03:53:23,660 --> 03:53:25,380
I'm gonna snipe everything.

3676
03:53:26,080 --> 03:53:26,800
Oh, nevermind.

3677
03:53:27,860 --> 03:53:29,820
Oh, I'm gonna fall into the water.

3678
03:53:30,440 --> 03:53:33,700
And slip around and not know how to run or walk or do anything.

3679
03:53:33,760 --> 03:53:34,120
I'm a baby.

3680
03:53:34,880 --> 03:53:35,560
Where are these guys?

3681
03:53:38,900 --> 03:53:39,980
Music is good.

3682
03:53:40,040 --> 03:53:44,640
My last stream actually got copyright because it was a remix of a...

3683
03:53:44,640 --> 03:53:45,160
Oh shit.

3684
03:53:45,740 --> 03:53:47,640
It was a remix of...

3685
03:53:50,960 --> 03:53:55,460
Of the God of War song, so it had a copyright strike on it.

3686
03:53:55,880 --> 03:53:56,400
Isn't that crazy?

3687
03:54:01,580 --> 03:54:03,140
Alloy can see recorded holograms.

3688
03:54:03,140 --> 03:54:03,620
Holograms.

3689
03:54:09,160 --> 03:54:10,220
Yeah, but it's okay.

3690
03:54:14,700 --> 03:54:15,760
Oh, I can't see.

3691
03:54:15,940 --> 03:54:16,300
There we go.

3692
03:54:18,520 --> 03:54:22,780
It's kind of tricky aiming with my controller.

3693
03:54:23,180 --> 03:54:24,380
Oh, it slows down everything too.

3694
03:54:24,440 --> 03:54:24,820
That's fun.

3695
03:54:27,740 --> 03:54:28,620
We're sniping?

3696
03:54:29,120 --> 03:54:30,020
Is there anything else?

3697
03:54:30,400 --> 03:54:30,840
Lizard?

3698
03:54:33,500 --> 03:54:34,840
Oh, it even shows me.

3699
03:54:35,220 --> 03:54:37,700
Like, see, it turns blue when I hit.

3700
03:54:38,580 --> 03:54:39,060
Yucky!

3701
03:54:40,540 --> 03:54:41,100
Minky!

3702
03:54:41,840 --> 03:54:42,860
Welcome to Mamba Shota!

3703
03:54:43,100 --> 03:54:43,320
Thank you!

3704
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:46,020
I don't think there's anything else around here.

3705
03:54:50,190 --> 03:54:50,750
Minky!

3706
03:54:51,310 --> 03:54:51,730
Yucky!

3707
03:54:56,110 --> 03:54:57,810
I like the music a lot though.

3708
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:08,580
So much for me sniping.

3709
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:10,740
What's this?

3710
03:55:13,800 --> 03:55:14,160
Okay.

3711
03:55:15,160 --> 03:55:22,960
Alright, well let's go that way first because it seems that way is the main road and this is a little side road to get our buddy over here.

3712
03:55:24,520 --> 03:55:25,260
On the wall?

3713
03:55:25,420 --> 03:55:26,580
I think you shot a bot down.

3714
03:55:26,740 --> 03:55:27,020
I did?

3715
03:55:28,580 --> 03:55:30,060
No, I think I shot down a lizard.

3716
03:55:30,780 --> 03:55:31,140
Right?

3717
03:55:31,820 --> 03:55:32,740
We'll see in a second.

3718
03:55:33,260 --> 03:55:34,640
Ah, see, this is our first guy.

3719
03:55:37,440 --> 03:55:38,160
Loyal Oseram.

3720
03:55:38,720 --> 03:55:40,900
As dependable an ally as they are a fighter.

3721
03:55:46,760 --> 03:55:48,260
No one else here, right?

3722
03:55:50,500 --> 03:55:52,700
How far can we snipe?

3723
03:55:58,280 --> 03:55:59,660
What's the drop-off?

3724
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:02,440
Damn.

3725
03:56:07,010 --> 03:56:07,690
Nice.

3726
03:56:07,910 --> 03:56:08,110
Alright.

3727
03:56:18,260 --> 03:56:18,940
Froggy!

3728
03:56:23,760 --> 03:56:24,720
Sniper wolf.

3729
03:56:27,260 --> 03:56:30,720
I am not a good shot.

3730
03:56:31,340 --> 03:56:34,760
But I'm an okay sniper if I have a shot.

3731
03:56:35,980 --> 03:56:40,140
If I have a shot, sniping is my only shot.

3732
03:56:41,140 --> 03:56:41,900
Typically.

3733
03:56:50,220 --> 03:56:50,980
Nice.

3734
03:56:52,840 --> 03:56:54,060
IDK about that.

3735
03:56:54,120 --> 03:56:54,700
Shut up!

3736
03:56:56,060 --> 03:56:58,000
Let me have confidence in one thing.

3737
03:57:08,580 --> 03:57:09,320
Hold on.

3738
03:57:10,200 --> 03:57:11,540
It's hard with the controller.

3739
03:57:12,360 --> 03:57:12,980
Where is it?

3740
03:57:13,040 --> 03:57:13,400
Where did it go?

3741
03:57:13,700 --> 03:57:14,100
There it is.

3742
03:57:15,560 --> 03:57:16,680
Let me go over here.

3743
03:57:17,300 --> 03:57:18,700
Let's go over here and do it instead.

3744
03:57:20,340 --> 03:57:21,940
One shot, one kill Binko.

3745
03:57:22,080 --> 03:57:22,480
Exactly.

3746
03:57:24,100 --> 03:57:25,560
That's what they all call me.

3747
03:57:26,120 --> 03:57:27,660
That's what I've always been.

3748
03:57:33,200 --> 03:57:35,200
So is it like a...

3749
03:57:35,200 --> 03:57:37,180
It's like a...

3750
03:57:37,180 --> 03:57:39,220
A post-apocalyptic world?

3751
03:57:39,660 --> 03:57:42,020
Security scouter has its eye on you.

3752
03:57:42,780 --> 03:57:44,280
Oh look at them!

3753
03:57:44,620 --> 03:57:47,140
Oh no, all the salary men.

3754
03:57:48,280 --> 03:57:48,700
Yes.

3755
03:58:02,270 --> 03:58:04,090
I'll free you from your...

3756
03:58:04,650 --> 03:58:05,290
Oh wow.

3757
03:58:06,270 --> 03:58:07,230
Oh my gosh, retro.

3758
03:58:08,090 --> 03:58:10,250
I'll free you from your...

3759
03:58:10,250 --> 03:58:10,830
Look at them.

3760
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:12,430
Even in death...

3761
03:58:12,430 --> 03:58:14,070
Even in death they are having to work.

3762
03:58:14,070 --> 03:58:15,570
This is so sad.

3763
03:58:16,290 --> 03:58:18,450
Alexa, play Despacito.

3764
03:58:28,420 --> 03:58:29,100
What's this?

3765
03:58:30,420 --> 03:58:31,160
What is that?

3766
03:58:32,940 --> 03:58:33,800
It says it's hitting.

3767
03:58:34,540 --> 03:58:35,600
But I don't know what I'm hitting.

3768
03:58:38,100 --> 03:58:39,740
I think... Hold on, let's try from here.

3769
03:58:41,640 --> 03:58:42,440
What is that?

3770
03:58:43,420 --> 03:58:44,380
Ah.

3771
03:58:45,720 --> 03:58:46,680
Okay.

3772
03:58:47,680 --> 03:58:49,440
Even in death...

3773
03:58:53,570 --> 03:58:55,550
The worker life never ends.

3774
03:58:57,270 --> 03:58:59,850
What kind of cruel fate is...

3775
03:58:59,850 --> 03:59:00,930
This?

3776
03:59:03,310 --> 03:59:06,530
I certainly did not pay attention enough.

3777
03:59:06,530 --> 03:59:06,950
Okay.

3778
03:59:15,290 --> 03:59:17,600
What if I jump off right here?

3779
03:59:18,700 --> 03:59:19,640
Is there anything in here?

3780
03:59:20,120 --> 03:59:21,560
I think I might have screwed myself.

3781
03:59:21,640 --> 03:59:21,980
There we go.

3782
03:59:22,560 --> 03:59:23,180
Nevermind.

3783
03:59:25,060 --> 03:59:26,260
I'm too close!

3784
03:59:28,180 --> 03:59:30,520
I'm fine.

3785
03:59:31,000 --> 03:59:32,960
Oh, I almost was not fine.

3786
03:59:33,060 --> 03:59:33,980
But I'm mostly fine.

3787
03:59:34,800 --> 03:59:36,060
We're mostly fine.

3788
03:59:39,020 --> 03:59:40,020
We're mostly fine.

3789
03:59:40,020 --> 03:59:40,640
We're mostly fine.

3790
03:59:51,610 --> 03:59:52,790
Actually, just come here.

3791
03:59:53,230 --> 03:59:53,850
Oh, never... Yeah.

3792
03:59:57,930 --> 03:59:59,510
Oh, you're filled with rage.

3793
03:59:59,690 --> 04:00:00,990
Oh, you're filled with so much.

3794
04:00:01,510 --> 04:00:02,870
Oh, you want to kill me.

3795
04:00:13,320 --> 04:00:14,120
Anything else?

3796
04:00:14,940 --> 04:00:19,120
I'm like, not realizing that I'm zooming in so close on their faces.

3797
04:00:19,260 --> 04:00:20,500
But I'm just trying to look around.

3798
04:00:23,320 --> 04:00:24,740
I wish I was a monkey.

3799
04:00:27,870 --> 04:00:29,340
Oh, you can cut it.

3800
04:00:32,240 --> 04:00:34,280
That makes things way easier.

3801
04:00:37,020 --> 04:00:38,080
Let's go over here.

3802
04:00:40,220 --> 04:00:40,760
There.

3803
04:00:41,920 --> 04:00:43,380
Oh, they're gardening.

3804
04:00:45,120 --> 04:00:45,780
How sweet.

3805
04:00:47,680 --> 04:00:48,700
What did I do?

3806
04:00:50,300 --> 04:00:50,940
Nice!

3807
04:00:51,940 --> 04:00:53,000
Second puzzle piece.

3808
04:00:55,220 --> 04:00:56,020
Minky is better.

3809
04:00:56,560 --> 04:00:57,220
I want to be Minky.

3810
04:00:58,060 --> 04:00:59,280
I want to return to Minky.

3811
04:01:16,580 --> 04:01:19,920
Hit the green things?

3812
04:01:24,050 --> 04:01:24,610
Yeah.

3813
04:01:26,250 --> 04:01:27,750
That would have made sense, huh?

3814
04:01:30,850 --> 04:01:32,150
Game devs hate me.

3815
04:01:33,430 --> 04:01:37,770
They're like, you know what, we're just going to put these giant green things in there.

3816
04:01:38,010 --> 04:01:47,930
Everybody who plays will know that that's what they have to hit to do it, you know?

3817
04:01:47,930 --> 04:01:53,390
Nobody is so dumb that they need yellow X's on where they need to go.

3818
04:01:54,450 --> 04:01:55,510
Nobody is that stupid.

3819
04:01:56,510 --> 04:01:57,370
Who is crying?

3820
04:01:57,650 --> 04:01:58,170
Oh my god.

3821
04:02:02,590 --> 04:02:04,510
Minto is the reason for the yellow tapes.

3822
04:02:09,180 --> 04:02:10,140
I got you!

3823
04:02:10,240 --> 04:02:11,000
You can't even swim.

3824
04:02:11,460 --> 04:02:12,240
This is so sad.

3825
04:02:15,320 --> 04:02:16,580
Have you met people?

3826
04:02:17,060 --> 04:02:18,260
I try not to.

3827
04:02:20,500 --> 04:02:21,700
Paternal outcast.

3828
04:02:21,960 --> 04:02:23,660
Trained a legendary warrior.

3829
04:02:28,700 --> 04:02:30,780
So wait, is this...

3830
04:02:32,860 --> 04:02:33,460
See?

3831
04:02:35,160 --> 04:02:36,240
Anything glows.

3832
04:02:36,440 --> 04:02:36,920
Wow!

3833
04:02:37,060 --> 04:02:38,060
Dead people in the car!

3834
04:02:41,360 --> 04:02:45,040
I think of anything goes and I'm thinking of that...

3835
04:02:45,040 --> 04:02:47,500
Sorry, since I watched Indiana Jones recently.

3836
04:02:47,500 --> 04:02:50,280
Thinking of anything goes.

3837
04:02:57,540 --> 04:02:58,660
Anything goes.

3838
04:02:58,780 --> 04:02:59,600
Can I die on this?

3839
04:03:00,020 --> 04:03:00,320
No.

3840
04:03:01,060 --> 04:03:02,480
Can I die from him though?

3841
04:03:02,820 --> 04:03:03,620
Can he step on me?

3842
04:03:11,200 --> 04:03:12,320
Not quite.

3843
04:03:13,920 --> 04:03:15,300
I think I'm getting chased.

3844
04:03:23,490 --> 04:03:24,090
Steppies.

3845
04:03:25,190 --> 04:03:27,010
No, don't be freaks.

3846
04:03:27,530 --> 04:03:28,810
Don't be freaks.

3847
04:03:28,970 --> 04:03:29,850
It was just an...

3848
04:03:29,850 --> 04:03:35,610
It was just an experiment, you know?

3849
04:03:39,160 --> 04:03:41,280
It wasn't that I wanted to be stepped on.

3850
04:03:41,440 --> 04:03:44,440
I was just experimenting with the stepping ability.

3851
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:45,980
It was possible.

3852
04:03:46,440 --> 04:03:47,140
That's all.

3853
04:03:47,840 --> 04:03:48,820
Don't make it weird.

3854
04:03:52,600 --> 04:03:53,800
Don't make it weird.

3855
04:03:58,960 --> 04:04:00,620
They always say that.

3856
04:04:04,510 --> 04:04:06,050
What's going on over here, right?

3857
04:04:08,210 --> 04:04:09,630
What's going on over here, right?

3858
04:04:10,530 --> 04:04:11,270
Oh, there's a guy.

3859
04:04:14,620 --> 04:04:16,540
I think I need just to...

3860
04:04:16,540 --> 04:04:17,540
There's boxes on the tree?

3861
04:04:17,660 --> 04:04:18,180
Oh, you're right.

3862
04:04:18,240 --> 04:04:18,680
Thank you.

3863
04:04:19,020 --> 04:04:22,440
Actually, we'll just hit the tree and see if it comes down.

3864
04:04:22,640 --> 04:04:23,340
Because I'm kind of lazy.

3865
04:04:24,820 --> 04:04:26,380
I come from six months later.

3866
04:04:26,800 --> 04:04:28,900
She still likes Metal Gear Solid.

3867
04:04:31,900 --> 04:04:33,200
Huge, if real.

3868
04:04:34,380 --> 04:04:35,000
Hello?

3869
04:04:35,980 --> 04:04:36,680
Thanks, Alan!

3870
04:04:37,440 --> 04:04:38,540
Thanks for six months.

3871
04:04:38,840 --> 04:04:40,260
There's even boxes up there.

3872
04:04:42,980 --> 04:04:43,800
Oh my god.

3873
04:04:44,220 --> 04:04:45,640
What's wrong with my controller?

3874
04:04:48,360 --> 04:04:49,560
Why can't...

3875
04:04:49,560 --> 04:04:51,340
Okay, so sometimes...

3876
04:04:51,340 --> 04:04:54,120
Sometimes I can turn, but sometimes I can't.

3877
04:04:55,900 --> 04:04:56,520
Funky.

3878
04:04:56,520 --> 04:04:56,740
Funky.

3879
04:04:58,540 --> 04:04:59,720
Funky, funky.

3880
04:05:00,760 --> 04:05:02,180
I'll take that.

3881
04:05:06,190 --> 04:05:08,170
And we'll just cut all these.

3882
04:05:08,790 --> 04:05:10,150
So there's no incidents.

3883
04:05:14,510 --> 04:05:15,910
I can only turn left.

3884
04:05:16,070 --> 04:05:16,830
Oh my gosh.

3885
04:05:17,510 --> 04:05:18,090
It's you.

3886
04:05:26,140 --> 04:05:28,400
Not opposite Owen Wilson.

3887
04:05:28,400 --> 04:05:34,340
Do you aim with the tilt?

3888
04:05:34,760 --> 04:05:34,980
Yeah.

3889
04:05:35,520 --> 04:05:36,860
Because sometimes you can.

3890
04:05:37,060 --> 04:05:38,860
And sometimes you can't, but sometimes you can.

3891
04:05:42,960 --> 04:05:43,940
I gotta go up.

3892
04:05:48,380 --> 04:05:48,780
Zoolander.

3893
04:05:51,340 --> 04:05:52,380
How do I...

3894
04:05:53,340 --> 04:05:56,120
Give me your... Show me your secrets.

3895
04:05:56,760 --> 04:05:57,840
Oh, he just walks on through.

3896
04:05:58,020 --> 04:05:58,840
Okay, I can do that.

3897
04:05:59,260 --> 04:06:00,220
Just kidding, I can't do that.

3898
04:06:00,260 --> 04:06:01,140
Oh, I see the green.

3899
04:06:04,300 --> 04:06:05,360
Oh, just kidding.

3900
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:09,360
Nice.

3901
04:06:12,880 --> 04:06:14,720
And that's all of it.

3902
04:06:17,960 --> 04:06:19,180
Look at the little deer.

3903
04:06:20,380 --> 04:06:22,320
They're not afraid of humans anymore.

3904
04:06:22,860 --> 04:06:23,820
Because they're machines.

3905
04:06:25,580 --> 04:06:29,100
They are man-made, so they are used to man.

3906
04:06:32,480 --> 04:06:35,400
They are man-made, so they are used to man.

3907
04:06:36,080 --> 04:06:38,080
It's kind of sad if you think about it.

3908
04:06:40,420 --> 04:06:42,620
Oh, I have to get...

3909
04:06:42,620 --> 04:06:44,640
Get up on the Hydra's back!

3910
04:06:49,080 --> 04:06:52,020
Get up on the Hydra's back!

3911
04:06:52,220 --> 04:06:52,760
Oh shit.

3912
04:07:00,540 --> 04:07:01,140
Nice.

3913
04:07:04,570 --> 04:07:06,650
A moment lived in infamy.

3914
04:07:08,850 --> 04:07:11,330
In the history of video gaming.

3915
04:07:14,170 --> 04:07:15,990
The infamous Hydra's back.

3916
04:07:18,250 --> 04:07:18,850
Thank you.

3917
04:07:20,350 --> 04:07:21,930
Okay, I could have used a warning.

3918
04:07:22,370 --> 04:07:23,210
Did I get everything here?

3919
04:07:23,270 --> 04:07:24,130
I think I got it.

3920
04:07:24,250 --> 04:07:25,710
Okay, I just have one more guy.

3921
04:07:26,470 --> 04:07:28,710
But we've got all the puzzle pieces, so...

3922
04:07:30,110 --> 04:07:31,590
I think we'll be able to make it.

3923
04:07:32,870 --> 04:07:34,430
Infamy more like mintfamy.

3924
04:07:35,870 --> 04:07:37,050
That's a monkey.

3925
04:07:38,990 --> 04:07:40,050
Not what we need.

3926
04:07:40,590 --> 04:07:41,050
Oh my gosh.

3927
04:07:41,050 --> 04:07:43,990
Oh my gosh.

3928
04:07:44,170 --> 04:07:45,410
I want to chill with the monkey.

3929
04:07:45,610 --> 04:07:46,590
There's our guy!

3930
04:07:55,130 --> 04:07:55,690
Nice.

3931
04:07:56,270 --> 04:07:56,830
And there we go.

3932
04:08:01,310 --> 04:08:02,430
Cherished wanderer.

3933
04:08:02,650 --> 04:08:04,010
Forever in pursuit of knowledge.

3934
04:08:07,970 --> 04:08:08,530
Minky!

3935
04:08:09,050 --> 04:08:10,790
Oh my god, he died and became Minky.

3936
04:08:11,950 --> 04:08:12,670
What a dream.

3937
04:08:17,270 --> 04:08:19,010
That guy was played by Lance Riddick.

3938
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:19,630
No way!

3939
04:08:20,830 --> 04:08:21,290
Oh my god.

3940
04:08:21,450 --> 04:08:22,290
Oh, that was close.

3941
04:08:37,060 --> 04:08:37,940
Oh, that was close.

3942
04:08:39,340 --> 04:08:42,380
I don't like that it sometimes slows down and sometimes it doesn't.

3943
04:08:42,900 --> 04:08:44,120
That confuses me.

3944
04:08:54,460 --> 04:08:55,820
Ripped to a real one.

3945
04:08:57,340 --> 04:09:01,920
Okay, I guess I don't need to explore so much since I've basically gotten everything.

3946
04:09:05,940 --> 04:09:07,080
Here we go.

3947
04:09:10,880 --> 04:09:12,160
Oh no!

3948
04:09:15,520 --> 04:09:20,180
Okay, he's looking awfully excitable for... Oh my god.

3949
04:09:30,920 --> 04:09:31,720
Come on!

3950
04:09:32,240 --> 04:09:33,200
Yes, got him.

3951
04:09:36,620 --> 04:09:37,720
He's coming back.

3952
04:09:37,760 --> 04:09:38,360
He's coming back.

3953
04:09:43,050 --> 04:09:43,630
Don't fall off.

3954
04:09:43,690 --> 04:09:44,390
Don't fall off.

3955
04:09:47,920 --> 04:09:48,880
Oh my god.

3956
04:09:55,630 --> 04:09:56,670
Please... Nice.

3957
04:10:00,050 --> 04:10:00,950
Metal Gear?

3958
04:10:01,250 --> 04:10:02,370
Oh my god, Metal Gear Rex?

3959
04:10:04,870 --> 04:10:06,150
Metal Gear Rex real?

3960
04:10:10,030 --> 04:10:11,570
Oh no, no way.

3961
04:10:11,990 --> 04:10:12,510
No way.

3962
04:10:12,650 --> 04:10:13,470
This is not possible.

3963
04:10:26,880 --> 04:10:28,200
Oh, he's found.

3964
04:10:29,280 --> 04:10:30,040
He's determined.

3965
04:10:43,660 --> 04:10:47,780
This is the fastest turtle in the history of turtles.

3966
04:10:47,940 --> 04:10:49,080
Turtles everywhere.

3967
04:10:54,330 --> 04:10:55,270
Are you okay?

3968
04:10:58,570 --> 04:11:01,870
He was literally... He was hauling such ass.

3969
04:11:02,250 --> 04:11:02,930
That guy.

3970
04:11:05,470 --> 04:11:06,390
Turtle left man.

3971
04:11:06,530 --> 04:11:07,130
Welcome to my mission.

3972
04:11:07,270 --> 04:11:07,870
Thank you.

3973
04:11:15,200 --> 04:11:17,620
No one will ever...

3974
04:11:18,160 --> 04:11:20,120
The turtle... Tortoise in the hair who?

3975
04:11:22,540 --> 04:11:23,400
Oh my god, again?

3976
04:11:28,380 --> 04:11:30,560
I thought you were... Oh my god, please.

3977
04:11:31,640 --> 04:11:32,520
Okay.

3978
04:11:34,160 --> 04:11:38,060
I missed.

3979
04:11:41,280 --> 04:11:42,920
Oh, he's dropping money though.

3980
04:11:49,630 --> 04:11:50,730
That's it?

3981
04:11:51,050 --> 04:11:53,030
Four hours, got a shiny Litwick.

3982
04:11:54,410 --> 04:11:56,730
We should name him Shiny Minto.

3983
04:12:00,380 --> 04:12:02,200
It's a massage.

3984
04:12:02,200 --> 04:12:02,300
Massage.

3985
04:12:07,080 --> 04:12:11,460
Astro Bot, Metal Gear Solid DLC win if only.

3986
04:12:17,590 --> 04:12:19,750
Why do I beautify the corpse?

3987
04:12:21,510 --> 04:12:23,290
Oh my god, graffiti in PS5.

3988
04:12:23,370 --> 04:12:25,170
Oh my gosh, it's littered with shit in there.

3989
04:12:26,030 --> 04:12:27,970
Hey, get out of there!

3990
04:12:30,590 --> 04:12:31,110
Oh.

3991
04:12:34,310 --> 04:12:35,430
Rescued ship part.

3992
04:12:36,810 --> 04:12:37,630
Oh my god, no!

3993
04:12:37,910 --> 04:12:38,810
It has a little alien.

3994
04:12:39,070 --> 04:12:40,450
Mother ship's protection covers.

3995
04:12:40,910 --> 04:12:43,630
The most stylish way to prevent burn up on re-entry.

3996
04:12:47,520 --> 04:12:48,400
There we go.

3997
04:12:49,440 --> 04:12:50,880
The graffiti actually looks nice.

3998
04:12:50,980 --> 04:12:51,580
It's kind of cute.

3999
04:12:55,780 --> 04:12:58,260
Oh yeah, you could name the Litwick Minky.

4000
04:13:00,260 --> 04:13:01,620
Minky is a perfect name.

4001
04:13:02,740 --> 04:13:04,780
I wouldn't mind if you guys kept calling me Minky.

4002
04:13:06,380 --> 04:13:09,920
Call me Minto, you can call me Mint, you can call me Minky.

4003
04:13:11,540 --> 04:13:13,020
Oh yeah, baby.

4004
04:13:13,640 --> 04:13:14,720
It's time.

4005
04:13:15,820 --> 04:13:17,420
I'm gonna be real sensitive here.

4006
04:13:18,540 --> 04:13:22,980
Wait, I kind of like the graffiti though.

4007
04:13:23,020 --> 04:13:23,680
It's kind of cute.

4008
04:13:26,500 --> 04:13:27,140
No!

4009
04:13:27,600 --> 04:13:28,860
I don't want to wash it off!

4010
04:13:29,940 --> 04:13:31,680
Oh my god, no!

4011
04:13:32,700 --> 04:13:33,340
No!

4012
04:13:33,980 --> 04:13:35,420
The octopus universe!

4013
04:13:36,800 --> 04:13:37,440
Lizard!

4014
04:13:37,780 --> 04:13:38,100
No!

4015
04:13:38,640 --> 04:13:39,160
Lizard!

4016
04:13:39,540 --> 04:13:40,420
Snake universe!

4017
04:13:40,660 --> 04:13:41,480
Monkey universe!

4018
04:13:41,620 --> 04:13:41,820
No!

4019
04:13:45,080 --> 04:13:50,040
These would be cute to sell as like actual covers for...

4020
04:13:50,040 --> 04:13:52,340
Oh my god, he's holding the little astronaut hostage!

4021
04:13:55,860 --> 04:13:57,040
My hands are getting hot.

4022
04:14:00,180 --> 04:14:02,300
Why is it so crunchy though?

4023
04:14:02,360 --> 04:14:04,040
What kind of paint do these guys use?

4024
04:14:05,780 --> 04:14:07,720
Alright, take out this ugly...

4025
04:14:09,360 --> 04:14:11,640
There's... Oh my god, there's bad guys on here!

4026
04:14:16,920 --> 04:14:17,740
Very good.

4027
04:14:20,820 --> 04:14:22,040
That's not paint.

4028
04:14:22,440 --> 04:14:23,560
What do you mean by that?

4029
04:14:24,500 --> 04:14:26,080
Can we call you Bintou?

4030
04:14:30,440 --> 04:14:31,000
Sure.

4031
04:14:31,660 --> 04:14:33,420
When did this become power wash, though?

4032
04:14:37,700 --> 04:14:38,260
Nice.

4033
04:14:38,460 --> 04:14:39,800
Oh, that one hurts my hands.

4034
04:14:43,820 --> 04:14:45,000
Here we go!

4035
04:14:45,500 --> 04:14:47,040
Screw it in, baby!

4036
04:14:47,040 --> 04:14:47,160
Baby!

4037
04:14:52,960 --> 04:14:55,920
The heart eyes down there are wild.

4038
04:14:56,160 --> 04:14:59,720
Look at the little robots with the heart eyes.

4039
04:14:59,720 --> 04:15:00,380
They're crazy.

4040
04:15:06,800 --> 04:15:07,540
Flip over.

4041
04:15:15,220 --> 04:15:17,260
The eyes are shaking.

4042
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:18,360
They're like...

4043
04:15:23,560 --> 04:15:26,260
And last but not least...

4044
04:15:32,210 --> 04:15:33,390
Oh my gosh!

4045
04:15:35,210 --> 04:15:36,130
What is this?

4046
04:15:42,290 --> 04:15:44,110
Oh my gosh, where's Snake?

4047
04:15:44,790 --> 04:15:45,850
Snake, can you see me?

4048
04:15:46,190 --> 04:15:47,130
I see Pyramid Head.

4049
04:15:47,310 --> 04:15:47,950
No, shut up game.

4050
04:15:47,970 --> 04:15:48,710
I know the tutorial.

4051
04:15:48,890 --> 04:15:49,630
I'm looking for Snake.

4052
04:15:50,470 --> 04:15:51,330
Where is that guy?

4053
04:15:51,710 --> 04:15:52,090
Snake?

4054
04:15:52,990 --> 04:15:55,650
What the hell is the Persona Bear doing?

4055
04:15:57,310 --> 04:15:58,190
Is he OK?

4056
04:15:58,190 --> 04:15:58,530
Snake?

4057
04:16:00,250 --> 04:16:02,090
What is he doing down there?

4058
04:16:02,350 --> 04:16:03,910
Wait, the other ones too.

4059
04:16:04,450 --> 04:16:05,030
Are they OK?

4060
04:16:05,870 --> 04:16:07,230
I don't see Snake.

4061
04:16:11,390 --> 04:16:13,450
He doesn't love me anymore.

4062
04:16:19,970 --> 04:16:21,270
There we go.

4063
04:16:23,570 --> 04:16:24,310
Oh my

4064
04:16:36,140 --> 04:16:38,860
gosh, it's beautiful.

4065
04:16:55,750 --> 04:16:58,930
Oh my gosh, it's beautiful.

4066
04:17:05,690 --> 04:17:07,150
Welcome to the army.

4067
04:17:08,690 --> 04:17:09,670
Now what?

4068
04:17:10,050 --> 04:17:11,430
We only have 30 guys left.

4069
04:17:12,790 --> 04:17:14,170
Oh my gosh.

4070
04:17:14,670 --> 04:17:16,070
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

4071
04:17:16,070 --> 04:17:18,270
I can't see...

4072
04:17:21,010 --> 04:17:21,650
Wait,

4073
04:17:27,360 --> 04:17:27,880
what is that?

4074
04:17:29,160 --> 04:17:30,680
We're still missing a piece?

4075
04:17:34,140 --> 04:17:34,600
Wee-woo.

4076
04:17:34,700 --> 04:17:36,140
Uh-oh, it's time for the wee-woo button.

4077
04:17:38,400 --> 04:17:39,980
They're all telling me to press it.

4078
04:17:40,320 --> 04:17:41,620
I'll do whatever you say, Snake.

4079
04:17:41,660 --> 04:17:42,240
Where are you?

4080
04:17:42,880 --> 04:17:44,120
Oh, hi Johnny's comrade.

4081
04:17:44,800 --> 04:17:47,180
Snake, I'll do whatever you tell me to.

4082
04:17:48,960 --> 04:17:50,500
Oh, all the Metal Gear...Oh, hello?

4083
04:17:51,040 --> 04:17:52,960
All the Metal Gears are...

4084
04:17:52,960 --> 04:17:53,880
They don't even care.

4085
04:17:53,960 --> 04:17:54,920
They're not even over here.

4086
04:17:54,920 --> 04:17:56,120
Oh man.

4087
04:17:57,420 --> 04:17:58,440
I'm hungry, chat.

4088
04:17:58,500 --> 04:18:00,040
What flavor wings should I get for dinner?

4089
04:18:00,540 --> 04:18:01,040
Garlic!

4090
04:18:02,980 --> 04:18:03,940
Is that a flavor?

4091
04:18:28,900 --> 04:18:30,500
Where is Snake?

4092
04:18:34,380 --> 04:18:36,140
This guy sucks so much.

4093
04:18:38,080 --> 04:18:38,920
Oh my god.

4094
04:18:38,920 --> 04:18:39,280
Ah!

4095
04:18:46,930 --> 04:18:48,070
Oh my god!

4096
04:18:48,210 --> 04:18:49,550
Oh my god, shut up.

4097
04:18:49,670 --> 04:18:50,510
This is so cute.

4098
04:18:50,990 --> 04:18:51,590
Stop!

4099
04:18:53,810 --> 04:18:55,170
Oh my god!

4100
04:18:55,410 --> 04:18:56,810
This is so cute!

4101
04:19:01,530 --> 04:19:03,050
Oh my god, PS3!

4102
04:19:03,550 --> 04:19:04,810
Oh my god, PS2!

4103
04:19:09,550 --> 04:19:11,010
Play Squadron Go?

4104
04:19:15,650 --> 04:19:16,850
Shoot him down!

4105
04:19:17,810 --> 04:19:18,670
Wait, there we go.

4106
04:19:21,940 --> 04:19:22,940
Yeah, shoot him down!

4107
04:19:23,880 --> 04:19:24,680
Oh, puzzle piece.

4108
04:19:24,880 --> 04:19:25,100
Puzzle piece!

4109
04:19:26,120 --> 04:19:27,280
I got it.

4110
04:19:27,400 --> 04:19:27,740
Nice.

4111
04:19:28,900 --> 04:19:30,320
There's even puzzle pieces here?

4112
04:19:30,600 --> 04:19:30,960
Oh my god.

4113
04:19:34,700 --> 04:19:36,060
Yeah, take him down.

4114
04:19:49,450 --> 04:19:51,230
Oh my god, so awesome.

4115
04:19:51,770 --> 04:19:52,370
Hey, watch out!

4116
04:19:52,610 --> 04:19:53,010
Watch out!

4117
04:20:01,270 --> 04:20:02,230
Oh, that was close.

4118
04:20:09,800 --> 04:20:10,900
Power of friendship!

4119
04:20:15,060 --> 04:20:15,680
Watch out!

4120
04:20:15,880 --> 04:20:16,380
There we go.

4121
04:20:17,020 --> 04:20:17,420
Take him out!

4122
04:20:17,480 --> 04:20:17,820
Take him out!

4123
04:20:22,100 --> 04:20:23,120
We'll help you!

4124
04:20:23,340 --> 04:20:24,040
We'll help you!

4125
04:20:24,920 --> 04:20:25,840
Take him out!

4126
04:20:25,940 --> 04:20:26,420
Take him out!

4127
04:20:26,500 --> 04:20:26,820
Take him out!

4128
04:20:26,880 --> 04:20:27,580
Take him out!

4129
04:20:30,840 --> 04:20:31,720
Yeah, close.

4130
04:20:33,680 --> 04:20:34,380
Oh my god.

4131
04:20:35,440 --> 04:20:36,920
Yeah, the PS2!

4132
04:20:37,800 --> 04:20:38,960
He's so chunky!

4133
04:20:40,380 --> 04:20:41,400
This is so awesome!

4134
04:20:41,880 --> 04:20:42,340
Oh my god!

4135
04:20:44,160 --> 04:20:44,600
Yeah!

4136
04:20:45,160 --> 04:20:46,080
Power of friendship!

4137
04:20:48,580 --> 04:20:50,540
Nice, I got another puzzle piece!

4138
04:20:52,040 --> 04:20:52,240
Oh

4139
04:20:57,450 --> 04:20:57,730
my god.

4140
04:21:05,180 --> 04:21:05,620
Backwards!

4141
04:21:05,780 --> 04:21:06,140
Oh my god.

4142
04:21:06,400 --> 04:21:07,400
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

4143
04:21:07,600 --> 04:21:08,200
I don't like this.

4144
04:21:11,180 --> 04:21:13,240
I just hear them screaming in the background.

4145
04:21:14,300 --> 04:21:16,540
I just hear them screaming in the background.

4146
04:21:21,080 --> 04:21:22,860
Oh my god.

4147
04:21:23,580 --> 04:21:27,190
The BME chunky!

4148
04:21:29,130 --> 04:21:30,830
I miss the PS2 so much.

4149
04:21:33,450 --> 04:21:34,170
Nice.

4150
04:21:34,530 --> 04:21:35,250
Puzzle piece.

4151
04:21:37,310 --> 04:21:38,030
Nice.

4152
04:21:50,980 --> 04:21:51,700
Nice.

4153
04:21:52,240 --> 04:21:53,160
I got you.

4154
04:21:54,760 --> 04:21:56,300
If you guys see Snake yell, ok?

4155
04:21:56,460 --> 04:21:57,480
Tell me the timestamp.

4156
04:21:58,340 --> 04:22:00,720
I wanna see that he's fighting alongside with me.

4157
04:22:01,040 --> 04:22:02,200
It would really mean a lot.

4158
04:22:05,260 --> 04:22:06,440
Tell me now if you see him.

4159
04:22:06,640 --> 04:22:07,340
I got you!

4160
04:22:07,500 --> 04:22:08,340
I got your back!

4161
04:22:08,560 --> 04:22:09,420
I had your back.

4162
04:22:09,760 --> 04:22:10,360
I tried.

4163
04:22:19,880 --> 04:22:21,220
I gotta also watch my back.

4164
04:22:22,480 --> 04:22:23,740
It's just that one guy there.

4165
04:22:24,340 --> 04:22:24,740
Nice.

4166
04:22:24,740 --> 04:22:25,000
Nice.

4167
04:22:28,120 --> 04:22:28,560
Oops.

4168
04:22:30,560 --> 04:22:31,340
Ok, there we go.

4169
04:22:49,530 --> 04:22:50,210
There we go.

4170
04:22:58,120 --> 04:22:59,140
Grab all these guys.

4171
04:22:59,900 --> 04:23:00,740
This is insanity.

4172
04:23:01,480 --> 04:23:02,480
This is so fun though.

4173
04:23:03,300 --> 04:23:03,640
Oh my god.

4174
04:23:03,800 --> 04:23:04,040
Oh my god.

4175
04:23:04,140 --> 04:23:04,840
Oh my god.

4176
04:23:05,100 --> 04:23:06,100
There's so much going on.

4177
04:23:06,380 --> 04:23:07,120
I can't see anything.

4178
04:23:09,500 --> 04:23:10,960
There's just so much...

4179
04:23:11,520 --> 04:23:11,940
Hello!

4180
04:23:13,080 --> 04:23:14,980
Thanks for getting my back!

4181
04:23:14,980 --> 04:23:15,360
Snake!

4182
04:23:18,180 --> 04:23:18,700
Nice.

4183
04:23:26,480 --> 04:23:27,000
Snake!

4184
04:23:28,240 --> 04:23:28,740
Are you in there?

4185
04:23:35,140 --> 04:23:35,980
We're gaming.

4186
04:23:36,220 --> 04:23:36,580
We're gaming.

4187
04:23:36,840 --> 04:23:37,160
We're gaming.

4188
04:23:37,440 --> 04:23:38,140
Watch out.

4189
04:23:38,600 --> 04:23:39,640
Watch out.

4190
04:23:41,200 --> 04:23:41,940
Watch out.

4191
04:23:42,580 --> 04:23:43,080
Puzzle piece.

4192
04:23:43,440 --> 04:23:44,500
Nice, I got the last one.

4193
04:23:45,340 --> 04:23:45,780
Get up!

4194
04:23:45,860 --> 04:23:46,380
Explode!

4195
04:23:47,920 --> 04:23:48,600
Nice.

4196
04:23:53,060 --> 04:23:53,740
Yeah.

4197
04:23:54,620 --> 04:23:54,940
Yeah.

4198
04:23:55,580 --> 04:23:56,540
Yeah, Mr. Evil.

4199
04:24:09,190 --> 04:24:10,550
The PS5!

4200
04:24:11,650 --> 04:24:12,570
Holy shit!

4201
04:24:14,350 --> 04:24:15,870
Oh no, I have hearts here.

4202
04:24:17,810 --> 04:24:19,810
Why do I have hearts here?

4203
04:24:21,510 --> 04:24:22,010
No!

4204
04:24:23,950 --> 04:24:25,650
There we go, space bully!

4205
04:24:28,230 --> 04:24:29,250
What the hell?

4206
04:24:30,370 --> 04:24:31,270
Oh, I get to...

4207
04:24:32,090 --> 04:24:33,610
What is this?

4208
04:24:35,310 --> 04:24:35,910
What is this?

4209
04:24:38,210 --> 04:24:38,850
Monkey!

4210
04:24:41,910 --> 04:24:44,070
What does the monkey do again?

4211
04:24:44,610 --> 04:24:45,430
Oh my god!

4212
04:24:48,050 --> 04:24:48,490
That's...

4213
04:24:48,490 --> 04:24:51,410
You'll learn why they call me Revolver.

4214
04:24:51,570 --> 04:24:51,950
Oh my god.

4215
04:24:52,070 --> 04:24:52,390
Oh my god.

4216
04:24:52,630 --> 04:24:53,050
Oh my god.

4217
04:24:56,910 --> 04:24:58,350
What does the monkey do again?

4218
04:25:00,390 --> 04:25:00,830
Mickey!

4219
04:25:09,060 --> 04:25:10,340
Oh, it grabs stuff.

4220
04:25:10,600 --> 04:25:11,640
Oh, that's right!

4221
04:25:12,580 --> 04:25:14,180
We gotta grab it and shoot it at him.

4222
04:25:19,110 --> 04:25:19,930
Yeah, thank you.

4223
04:25:25,120 --> 04:25:25,560
Nice.

4224
04:25:41,020 --> 04:25:42,660
OK, next round!

4225
04:25:48,380 --> 04:25:49,720
Here we go!

4226
04:26:02,990 --> 04:26:03,630
That

4227
04:26:21,120 --> 04:26:22,340
was too slow!

4228
04:26:30,990 --> 04:26:31,630
There we go.

4229
04:26:33,070 --> 04:26:33,810
Dang it.

4230
04:26:35,290 --> 04:26:37,510
Oh, I think I was supposed to hit that.

4231
04:26:38,130 --> 04:26:39,150
Oh dang it.

4232
04:26:39,210 --> 04:26:40,450
I was supposed to...

4233
04:26:41,830 --> 04:26:42,790
Oh shoot!

4234
04:26:45,150 --> 04:26:46,230
I was supposed to hit it.

4235
04:26:46,330 --> 04:26:46,570
Oops.

4236
04:26:47,090 --> 04:26:48,470
It's OK, I realize after.

4237
04:26:49,150 --> 04:26:49,930
It's OK, we'll do it.

4238
04:26:56,510 --> 04:26:56,870
OK.

4239
04:27:06,150 --> 04:27:06,590
There we go.

4240
04:27:14,920 --> 04:27:16,080
Can I get the other one?

4241
04:27:16,160 --> 04:27:16,360
Nope.

4242
04:27:18,780 --> 04:27:20,560
Oh my god, this is such a long fight.

4243
04:27:25,380 --> 04:27:26,220
Uh oh.

4244
04:27:26,780 --> 04:27:28,280
What happens if I pick the death?

4245
04:27:29,560 --> 04:27:32,420
What happens if I accidentally land on death?

4246
04:27:35,650 --> 04:27:36,350
My nose is running!

4247
04:27:42,900 --> 04:27:43,500
Froggy!

4248
04:27:44,220 --> 04:27:45,940
I don't remember what Froggy does.

4249
04:27:46,260 --> 04:27:46,420
Wait!

4250
04:27:47,040 --> 04:27:48,120
You jerk!

4251
04:27:48,120 --> 04:27:48,300
Good.

4252
04:27:59,720 --> 04:28:00,540
Collect the pieces!

4253
04:28:00,940 --> 04:28:01,600
Collect the pieces!

4254
04:28:01,740 --> 04:28:02,620
Collect the pieces!

4255
04:28:02,900 --> 04:28:04,560
Collect the pieces and we'll fling the pieces!

4256
04:28:05,020 --> 04:28:05,620
Collect the pieces!

4257
04:28:05,820 --> 04:28:06,380
Collect the pieces!

4258
04:28:06,800 --> 04:28:08,120
Then we'll fling the pieces!

4259
04:28:09,820 --> 04:28:10,560
I'm too big!

4260
04:28:17,240 --> 04:28:18,720
That one wasn't so bad actually.

4261
04:28:20,840 --> 04:28:21,640
That one was so easy.

4262
04:28:30,630 --> 04:28:31,530
Was that it?

4263
04:28:35,320 --> 04:28:36,280
Oh my gosh!

4264
04:28:37,580 --> 04:28:38,680
First try!

4265
04:28:51,660 --> 04:28:52,940
Things complete!

4266
04:28:55,540 --> 04:28:56,320
Where is Snake?

4267
04:28:56,860 --> 04:28:57,640
He's not here.

4268
04:28:57,700 --> 04:28:58,220
So sad.

4269
04:28:58,660 --> 04:28:59,320
Wait, is he there?

4270
04:28:59,640 --> 04:29:00,060
Is he anywhere?

4271
04:29:01,520 --> 04:29:02,460
Phase 2?

4272
04:29:04,640 --> 04:29:06,360
I see a grey fox.

4273
04:29:07,240 --> 04:29:08,580
There he is!

4274
04:29:12,580 --> 04:29:13,300
Snake!

4275
04:29:13,600 --> 04:29:14,100
Snake!

4276
04:29:18,260 --> 04:29:18,800
Oh shit!

4277
04:29:36,520 --> 04:29:37,520
Oh my God!

4278
04:29:43,820 --> 04:29:45,340
Oh no we didn't.

4279
04:29:52,740 --> 04:29:53,460
Snake!

4280
04:29:54,500 --> 04:29:54,500
No!

4281
04:30:01,900 --> 04:30:02,380
Oh my God!

4282
04:30:02,480 --> 04:30:03,700
My army!

4283
04:30:03,700 --> 04:30:05,520
Look at them go!

4284
04:30:06,860 --> 04:30:07,900
Oh my God!

4285
04:30:07,980 --> 04:30:08,780
So cute!

4286
04:30:16,460 --> 04:30:16,940
No!

4287
04:30:44,010 --> 04:30:45,270
Shut up, is that the ending?

4288
04:30:46,230 --> 04:30:46,950
Are these the credits?

4289
04:31:03,370 --> 04:31:04,510
He made it!

4290
04:31:05,550 --> 04:31:07,250
Oh my God, the fake out was real.

4291
04:31:07,570 --> 04:31:09,130
You guys, I actually started crying.

4292
04:31:17,790 --> 04:31:20,970
Oh my God, I actually started crying over these stupid little robots.

4293
04:31:21,890 --> 04:31:23,670
No, we have to put them back together!

4294
04:31:25,510 --> 04:31:26,930
Oh my God, live!

4295
04:31:27,610 --> 04:31:28,850
You must live!

4296
04:31:30,010 --> 04:31:30,510
Minky!

4297
04:31:33,650 --> 04:31:34,830
We have his arm!

4298
04:31:37,150 --> 04:31:38,150
Ok Minky.

4299
04:31:38,550 --> 04:31:39,950
Minky, take this.

4300
04:31:40,510 --> 04:31:42,010
I'll be nice and gentle about it.

4301
04:31:45,610 --> 04:31:46,690
Minky, are you ok?

4302
04:31:46,990 --> 04:31:49,410
Minky, wake up Minky!

4303
04:31:51,930 --> 04:31:53,210
Minky, wake up Minky!

4304
04:31:53,590 --> 04:31:54,570
Minky, what else do you need?

4305
04:31:57,470 --> 04:32:00,210
Are they offering their body parts?

4306
04:32:02,970 --> 04:32:04,870
They are offering themselves!

4307
04:32:05,850 --> 04:32:07,090
Oh my God, no!

4308
04:32:07,570 --> 04:32:11,710
They are offering their arms and their legs!

4309
04:32:12,210 --> 04:32:12,650
Minky!

4310
04:32:13,610 --> 04:32:14,050
Minky!

4311
04:32:25,800 --> 04:32:27,420
Oh my God, he just already took it off.

4312
04:32:27,460 --> 04:32:28,760
He's like ok, I know what you need.

4313
04:32:32,080 --> 04:32:33,020
Minky, wake up!

4314
04:32:33,380 --> 04:32:33,760
Minky!

4315
04:32:34,480 --> 04:32:35,760
I gave you what you needed!

4316
04:32:36,120 --> 04:32:36,380
Minky!

4317
04:32:36,580 --> 04:32:36,840
Minky!

4318
04:32:37,000 --> 04:32:40,280
Minky, wake up!

4319
04:32:40,900 --> 04:32:41,340
Minky!

4320
04:32:42,140 --> 04:32:43,420
What else do we need guys?

4321
04:32:47,220 --> 04:32:48,600
What are you searching for?

4322
04:32:49,600 --> 04:32:51,200
Another heart!

4323
04:32:51,820 --> 04:32:52,880
Oh my God!

4324
04:32:54,140 --> 04:32:56,860
This is what all video games need you guys!

4325
04:32:57,860 --> 04:32:58,980
It's heart!

4326
04:32:59,560 --> 04:33:01,140
It's soul!

4327
04:33:05,360 --> 04:33:07,580
Minky, wake up!

4328
04:33:10,580 --> 04:33:11,140
Minky?

4329
04:33:11,820 --> 04:33:12,260
Minky?

4330
04:33:26,950 --> 04:33:28,390
Snake is right there!

4331
04:33:41,360 --> 04:33:42,120
Hi Snake!

4332
04:33:46,280 --> 04:33:47,380
Oh my arm!

4333
04:33:47,440 --> 04:33:48,280
Hi Snake!

4334
04:33:48,480 --> 04:33:50,660
Here we go!

4335
04:34:01,240 --> 04:34:03,260
That guy is fighting for his life!

4336
04:34:04,380 --> 04:34:05,460
Pull him up!

4337
04:34:06,600 --> 04:34:08,080
Oh my God, the PS4!

4338
04:34:09,040 --> 04:34:10,840
Snake, how did you get all the way over there?

4339
04:34:12,900 --> 04:34:13,640
Oh yeah!

4340
04:34:16,840 --> 04:34:17,440
Oh

4341
04:34:24,370 --> 04:34:26,070
my God, interactive credits!

4342
04:34:26,070 --> 04:34:26,870
Wow!

4343
04:34:28,130 --> 04:34:29,570
We got the dog, ok.

4344
04:34:30,090 --> 04:34:31,590
We can get more coins here even.

4345
04:34:31,870 --> 04:34:32,890
The V-Dog!

4346
04:34:45,490 --> 04:34:46,930
No, VR!

4347
04:34:47,950 --> 04:34:48,730
There we go.

4348
04:34:48,850 --> 04:34:49,910
What if you fell off here?

4349
04:34:51,190 --> 04:34:53,090
What happens if you fall off here?

4350
04:34:57,310 --> 04:34:58,970
This is so cute!

4351
04:35:04,290 --> 04:35:05,670
We got the froggies.

4352
04:35:06,390 --> 04:35:07,150
Oh my God, uncharted.

4353
04:35:07,370 --> 04:35:08,410
Oh the PS3!

4354
04:35:14,890 --> 04:35:16,690
Oh my gosh!

4355
04:35:24,170 --> 04:35:26,050
Sorry, I can't stop saying wow.

4356
04:35:26,270 --> 04:35:31,350
I'm filled with so many emotions right now.

4357
04:35:34,050 --> 04:35:35,770
I'm filled with so many emotions.

4358
04:35:35,990 --> 04:35:36,530
Holy shit.

4359
04:35:39,550 --> 04:35:40,810
Oops, my bad.

4360
04:35:40,930 --> 04:35:41,530
Wait, what happened?

4361
04:35:47,270 --> 04:35:48,150
The PS3!

4362
04:35:50,610 --> 04:35:53,250
Well, I guess we found out what happens if you fall off.

4363
04:35:54,170 --> 04:35:55,150
Now we know.

4364
04:35:56,530 --> 04:35:56,930
Abe!

4365
04:36:02,310 --> 04:36:02,830
Oh

4366
04:36:06,890 --> 04:36:07,690
my God, the fireworks!

4367
04:36:16,100 --> 04:36:18,620
Oh my God, I can still collect coins?

4368
04:36:19,280 --> 04:36:20,160
This is ridiculous.

4369
04:36:20,160 --> 04:36:21,960
Astro Bot.

4370
04:36:22,700 --> 04:36:27,230
My friends!

4371
04:36:28,950 --> 04:36:30,150
The PS2!

4372
04:36:32,090 --> 04:36:33,750
Sorry, depth perception.

4373
04:36:37,350 --> 04:36:38,810
Astro Bot.

4374
04:36:40,030 --> 04:36:40,510
Oh

4375
04:36:45,530 --> 04:36:47,850
no, it's the time slow one.

4376
04:36:48,250 --> 04:36:49,750
I'm not good at this one you guys.

4377
04:36:53,580 --> 04:36:55,580
I am Astro Bot.

4378
04:36:57,430 --> 04:36:58,990
Astro Bot.

4379
04:36:59,990 --> 04:37:00,610
Wing!

4380
04:37:02,510 --> 04:37:03,990
What is that?

4381
04:37:04,110 --> 04:37:04,530
Oh, Bot.

4382
04:37:06,570 --> 04:37:08,630
Oh wait, is that the PS2 Slim?

4383
04:37:09,010 --> 04:37:09,630
Nice!

4384
04:37:12,570 --> 04:37:13,790
So cute.

4385
04:37:17,780 --> 04:37:20,110
Oh look, there are the shapes!

4386
04:37:28,790 --> 04:37:30,610
What the hell is this one?

4387
04:37:30,930 --> 04:37:32,010
When did I ever get this?

4388
04:37:41,210 --> 04:37:41,930
Wee!

4389
04:37:41,930 --> 04:37:42,650
Wee!

4390
04:37:56,740 --> 04:37:58,560
The PS1, wow.

4391
04:37:59,140 --> 04:38:00,420
Snake, are you in there?

4392
04:38:03,440 --> 04:38:04,620
Oh my God!

4393
04:38:15,920 --> 04:38:17,060
Wait, what the hell is this?

4394
04:38:18,940 --> 04:38:21,420
I never had these things before.

4395
04:38:25,060 --> 04:38:26,900
What are those?

4396
04:38:37,410 --> 04:38:38,490
We're good.

4397
04:38:42,850 --> 04:38:44,490
It's so beautiful!

4398
04:38:48,540 --> 04:38:50,320
Oh my God, all my friends.

4399
04:38:55,490 --> 04:38:56,670
Where is he?

4400
04:38:58,670 --> 04:39:00,190
Oh, I see Psycho Mantis.

4401
04:39:02,610 --> 04:39:05,920
A present?

4402
04:39:06,560 --> 04:39:07,220
For me?

4403
04:39:32,420 --> 04:39:34,280
It's so good!

4404
04:39:35,680 --> 04:39:37,120
Minky and Minky.

4405
04:39:38,640 --> 04:39:40,700
I wish they had asked my name at the beginning.

4406
04:39:41,220 --> 04:39:42,600
It would have been crazy if it said Minto.

4407
04:39:51,390 --> 04:39:52,510
Wait, hold on, I'll move.

4408
04:39:59,150 --> 04:39:59,590
Cute!

4409
04:40:02,970 --> 04:40:04,010
All the enemies.

4410
04:40:04,010 --> 04:40:04,330
Enemies.

4411
04:40:06,930 --> 04:40:08,050
Buggy Bunny, Gloopy!

4412
04:40:08,330 --> 04:40:09,090
Oh my God, they have names!

4413
04:40:09,230 --> 04:40:09,870
Oh my goodness.

4414
04:40:12,710 --> 04:40:13,970
I think they're...

4415
04:40:16,310 --> 04:40:19,310
Pumpkindle, Rooter, Triptrap, Lemmy, thanks for the gifted!

4416
04:40:20,350 --> 04:40:22,110
Oh my gosh, this was...

4417
04:40:24,190 --> 04:40:26,130
This game is so cute.

4418
04:40:26,550 --> 04:40:27,050
Snake!

4419
04:40:28,130 --> 04:40:30,550
Veno, Bolter, Wormy and Voxel.

4420
04:40:39,510 --> 04:40:39,870
Voxel.

4421
04:40:39,870 --> 04:40:41,030
I liked Roundbones.

4422
04:40:41,930 --> 04:40:43,690
Vulture, Shockrock... Oh, I didn't see the other name.

4423
04:40:44,170 --> 04:40:45,710
The one guy we saw for two seconds.

4424
04:40:47,150 --> 04:40:48,170
That's the Uncharted area.

4425
04:40:48,290 --> 04:40:50,570
That's right, that was the other world we had to go to.

4426
04:40:50,650 --> 04:40:51,130
It was Uncharted.

4427
04:40:52,050 --> 04:40:52,410
Mistletoe!

4428
04:40:57,270 --> 04:40:58,370
Oh, Volipop, thank you.

4429
04:41:02,670 --> 04:41:03,430
Thank you.

4430
04:41:03,430 --> 04:41:03,670
Mito!

4431
04:41:04,550 --> 04:41:05,150
Phanto!

4432
04:41:05,790 --> 04:41:06,390
Close enough.

4433
04:41:07,170 --> 04:41:07,650
Igni.

4434
04:41:10,470 --> 04:41:12,070
Dosukoi, Dosukoi.

4435
04:41:15,070 --> 04:41:17,790
Piranha, Snap, Snap, Tramp.

4436
04:41:22,130 --> 04:41:22,890
Fugu!

4437
04:41:27,320 --> 04:41:29,260
Oh, because it's like Fugu, that's so cute.

4438
04:41:36,670 --> 04:41:37,990
I hated those chameleons.

4439
04:41:38,170 --> 04:41:40,310
Minimon, Minileon.

4440
04:41:40,690 --> 04:41:40,930
Leon.

4441
04:41:41,350 --> 04:41:41,950
Minileon?

4442
04:41:46,450 --> 04:41:48,970
What is... Captain Shortview is Captain Pinscher.

4443
04:41:49,130 --> 04:41:49,690
Are they brother?

4444
04:41:49,910 --> 04:41:51,670
Wait, that was Solidus and that was...

4445
04:41:53,050 --> 04:41:57,150
Wait, one of them was Solidus and one of them was naked.

4446
04:41:58,770 --> 04:42:00,130
Frigidfrosty, Tama Trio.

4447
04:42:08,480 --> 04:42:09,180
The Djinn.

4448
04:42:10,200 --> 04:42:11,500
Djinnia the Lamb.

4449
04:42:11,820 --> 04:42:12,680
Chief Kawa.

4450
04:42:14,700 --> 04:42:16,380
You wouldn't really like Astro's playroom.

4451
04:42:18,320 --> 04:42:19,840
It has snake too?

4452
04:42:19,920 --> 04:42:20,540
No way!

4453
04:42:22,180 --> 04:42:23,020
Megaglooper.

4454
04:42:23,800 --> 04:42:24,500
Sapling.

4455
04:42:26,360 --> 04:42:28,180
It's so creepy.

4456
04:42:29,340 --> 04:42:30,760
What the hell?

4457
04:42:31,240 --> 04:42:32,280
Oh, I like the dinosaur.

4458
04:42:33,860 --> 04:42:34,700
Blunderjaw.

4459
04:42:43,660 --> 04:42:44,860
Astro Bot is my game of the year.

4460
04:42:44,940 --> 04:42:46,640
Happy to see you beat it and enjoyed it.

4461
04:43:04,050 --> 04:43:04,770
The end.

4462
04:43:16,430 --> 04:43:17,650
New galaxy discovered.

4463
04:43:17,810 --> 04:43:20,950
Now you can reenact the thrilling final battle as often as you like.

4464
04:43:22,050 --> 04:43:22,930
Nice!

4465
04:43:23,550 --> 04:43:25,350
It is a thrilling final battle.

4466
04:43:26,130 --> 04:43:29,910
New galaxy discovered.

4467
04:43:30,050 --> 04:43:31,170
Time to perfect your...

4468
04:43:32,350 --> 04:43:34,990
Time to perfect your speedrunning skills.

4469
04:43:47,580 --> 04:43:49,040
Speedrun time.

4470
04:43:51,640 --> 04:43:57,600
There was only one outfit that we missed.

4471
04:44:01,660 --> 04:44:02,100
Congratulations!

4472
04:44:02,340 --> 04:44:04,380
You rid the world of that evil bully and saved the day.

4473
04:44:04,620 --> 04:44:06,240
But there are still many lost bots to rescue.

4474
04:44:06,560 --> 04:44:07,380
Can you find them all?

4475
04:44:11,560 --> 04:44:12,720
One moment please.

4476
04:44:13,640 --> 04:44:15,020
There might be some more gacha.

4477
04:44:19,140 --> 04:44:20,540
There is more gacha.

4478
04:44:21,140 --> 04:44:22,900
We can definitely at least do these.

4479
04:44:24,560 --> 04:44:25,320
It's a giraffe.

4480
04:44:25,320 --> 04:44:25,940
Giraffe.

4481
04:44:28,920 --> 04:44:30,260
No new outfit though.

4482
04:44:30,320 --> 04:44:31,260
Malicious AI.

4483
04:44:35,640 --> 04:44:36,640
Loot bunny.

4484
04:44:37,800 --> 04:44:39,520
Oh, these are all the...

4485
04:44:39,520 --> 04:44:40,740
Horizon ones.

4486
04:44:42,940 --> 04:44:44,220
Ancient interface.

4487
04:44:47,560 --> 04:44:49,700
Nothing beats watching Mint on your birthday.

4488
04:44:49,840 --> 04:44:50,580
21 years.

4489
04:44:51,160 --> 04:44:52,340
Red, happy birthday!

4490
04:44:53,340 --> 04:44:56,860
Happy birthday to you.

4491
04:44:57,320 --> 04:44:59,820
Happy birthday to you.

4492
04:45:00,300 --> 04:45:02,760
Happy birthday dear Red.

4493
04:45:04,100 --> 04:45:07,660
Happy birthday to you.

4494
04:45:09,660 --> 04:45:10,960
Happy birthday!

4495
04:45:14,340 --> 04:45:18,340
Maybe we have to get a puzzle piece for the...

4496
04:45:20,860 --> 04:45:23,900
Maybe we have to get a puzzle piece for the last outfit.

4497
04:45:24,140 --> 04:45:25,020
Maybe it's not a person.

4498
04:45:25,360 --> 04:45:26,280
Oh my gosh, the giraffe!

4499
04:45:27,500 --> 04:45:30,880
Oh my gosh, this thing makes me want to play Horizon.

4500
04:45:30,980 --> 04:45:31,880
It's so...

4501
04:45:31,880 --> 04:45:33,300
It's so cute.

4502
04:45:33,520 --> 04:45:34,640
Oh my god.

4503
04:45:35,060 --> 04:45:37,280
It's actually so beautiful.

4504
04:45:38,320 --> 04:45:39,700
It's so cute.

4505
04:45:39,840 --> 04:45:41,840
Oh my gosh, I can't get over how cute it is.

4506
04:45:56,260 --> 04:45:58,580
I can't believe I get this reference now.

4507
04:46:00,020 --> 04:46:04,240
I want to play so many more games so that I can come back to this and be like...

4508
04:46:04,240 --> 04:46:06,060
I understand this reference now.

4509
04:46:06,300 --> 04:46:06,680
You know?

4510
04:46:08,340 --> 04:46:11,840
So many more games in here so I can be like... I understand this reference.

4511
04:46:19,760 --> 04:46:20,560
Let's see.

4512
04:46:20,780 --> 04:46:24,500
I think we got... I don't know how many more we missed of these.

4513
04:46:25,560 --> 04:46:26,340
Just one?

4514
04:46:28,360 --> 04:46:29,720
Just one paint?

4515
04:46:31,140 --> 04:46:32,520
But I like our current one.

4516
04:46:32,980 --> 04:46:34,040
These streams have been so much fun.

4517
04:46:34,080 --> 04:46:35,940
I'm going to miss Snakebot and the rest of the gang.

4518
04:46:36,060 --> 04:46:36,720
Me too!

4519
04:46:37,620 --> 04:46:39,220
And we missed one outfit.

4520
04:46:42,260 --> 04:46:42,780
But...

4521
04:46:47,030 --> 04:46:48,730
And then I guess... Hold on.

4522
04:46:49,510 --> 04:46:54,690
I guess it was... The puzzle piece was all the way over here.

4523
04:46:55,610 --> 04:46:57,710
Like the thing that we are trying to finish.

4524
04:47:01,320 --> 04:47:02,540
It's right here.

4525
04:47:04,440 --> 04:47:06,100
We are almost done with it.

4526
04:47:07,440 --> 04:47:11,740
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

4527
04:47:12,420 --> 04:47:13,860
11 pieces left.

4528
04:47:15,300 --> 04:47:16,420
Did you beat all the secret levels?

4529
04:47:16,520 --> 04:47:17,180
I did not.

4530
04:47:17,960 --> 04:47:18,820
But that's okay.

4531
04:47:24,580 --> 04:47:25,240
That's okay.

4532
04:47:25,240 --> 04:47:25,260
That's okay.

4533
04:47:31,420 --> 04:47:32,020
That's it?

4534
04:47:32,100 --> 04:47:32,620
That's all they do?

4535
04:47:33,840 --> 04:47:35,060
Are they even awake?

4536
04:47:38,760 --> 04:47:40,760
You need 250 bots to get in there?

4537
04:47:40,880 --> 04:47:43,540
I have way more than 250 bots.

4538
04:47:45,220 --> 04:47:48,020
I have like 2... How many bots do I have at this point?

4539
04:47:49,000 --> 04:47:49,720
270?

4540
04:47:50,000 --> 04:47:50,240
280?

4541
04:47:50,720 --> 04:47:51,760
Almost 280?

4542
04:47:51,980 --> 04:47:52,220
Maybe.

4543
04:47:53,960 --> 04:47:54,700
I still beat.

4544
04:48:21,830 --> 04:48:24,330
You look so good.

4545
04:48:25,250 --> 04:48:26,910
You look so good.

4546
04:48:27,950 --> 04:48:28,290
Where?

4547
04:48:37,540 --> 04:48:39,060
Open up, Snake.

4548
04:48:39,280 --> 04:48:39,980
Open up!

4549
04:48:39,980 --> 04:48:41,120
Open up!

4550
04:48:41,280 --> 04:48:41,780
What does it say?

4551
04:48:41,860 --> 04:48:42,660
Solid state?

4552
04:48:42,760 --> 04:48:43,500
That's so silly.

4553
04:48:45,100 --> 04:48:46,500
Congrats on another game clear.

4554
04:48:46,720 --> 04:48:47,460
Thank you!

4555
04:48:53,940 --> 04:48:55,360
I love this.

4556
04:48:55,440 --> 04:48:58,200
I love that you can see the scene on the...

4557
04:48:58,720 --> 04:49:00,680
On the screen.

4558
04:49:00,860 --> 04:49:01,760
It's so good.

4559
04:49:03,220 --> 04:49:06,140
Oh, I'm gonna miss my little guy so much.

4560
04:49:06,140 --> 04:49:09,960
I'm gonna miss my guys so much.

4561
04:49:14,760 --> 04:49:18,660
The music makes me so emo-y.

4562
04:49:27,960 --> 04:49:30,200
Did you play Astro's Playroom before this?

4563
04:49:30,260 --> 04:49:31,200
I didn't, actually.

4564
04:49:34,460 --> 04:49:36,120
But this is so fun.

4565
04:49:37,060 --> 04:49:41,460
I know I didn't like 100% get everybody and complete all the worlds, but that's okay.

4566
04:49:42,580 --> 04:49:47,760
Maybe I'll come back to it, like, for just some random stream.

4567
04:49:48,040 --> 04:49:48,600
There's only a few.

4568
04:49:48,800 --> 04:49:49,500
Let's see, one.

4569
04:49:53,160 --> 04:49:54,460
The music's different.

4570
04:50:07,680 --> 04:50:09,360
One puzzle piece there.

4571
04:50:11,660 --> 04:50:12,140
Two.

4572
04:50:12,840 --> 04:50:14,760
What do you have, like, 12?

4573
04:50:15,220 --> 04:50:17,020
Oh, see, there's so many in this one.

4574
04:50:20,100 --> 04:50:20,540
Three.

4575
04:50:23,020 --> 04:50:23,460
Four.

4576
04:50:26,120 --> 04:50:27,780
I think I got all of them in here.

4577
04:50:28,180 --> 04:50:30,760
Are there any in here?

4578
04:50:31,360 --> 04:50:33,420
Oh my gosh, there's even 10 guys in here!

4579
04:50:34,380 --> 04:50:35,560
Try a speedway?

4580
04:50:35,700 --> 04:50:36,880
Okay, I'll try a speedway.

4581
04:50:41,420 --> 04:50:42,600
Let's try with the monkey.

4582
04:50:44,060 --> 04:50:45,360
There's a leaderboard!

4583
04:50:47,720 --> 04:50:48,120
Minky!

4584
04:50:54,450 --> 04:50:55,930
Okay, we already start with Minky.

4585
04:50:56,030 --> 04:50:56,470
Let's go!

4586
04:51:35,970 --> 04:51:36,410
Wait,

4587
04:51:44,520 --> 04:51:45,180
which way do I go?

4588
04:51:45,440 --> 04:51:45,820
This way?

4589
04:51:59,360 --> 04:51:59,800
No!

4590
04:51:59,800 --> 04:52:00,900
Wait, what do I do here?

4591
04:52:03,200 --> 04:52:04,560
Wait, how do I...

4592
04:52:14,020 --> 04:52:14,420
Swing!

4593
04:52:14,540 --> 04:52:17,700
I'm trying... I'm not... I'm... I can't... It's not letting me do anything.

4594
04:52:18,140 --> 04:52:21,200
Oh, I have to do it with the control...

4595
04:52:21,880 --> 04:52:24,720
Oh my god.

4596
04:52:48,070 --> 04:52:48,650
Oh my gosh.

4597
04:52:50,470 --> 04:52:50,870
We're

4598
04:53:08,840 --> 04:53:10,780
so close to sub 2 minutes!

4599
04:53:11,340 --> 04:53:12,800
2, 2, 2!

4600
04:53:24,540 --> 04:53:26,240
Yeah, there were guys in this.

4601
04:53:26,260 --> 04:53:26,860
Where were they?

4602
04:53:27,800 --> 04:53:28,720
Check the leaderboard.

4603
04:53:32,820 --> 04:53:33,500
I'm scared.

4604
04:53:33,980 --> 04:53:35,500
Oh wait, don't look at my profile picture.

4605
04:53:39,180 --> 04:53:39,720
Why?

4606
04:54:00,380 --> 04:54:03,580
Holy moly, I'm 100,000th.

4607
04:54:03,580 --> 04:54:05,620
What's the world record?

4608
04:54:06,200 --> 04:54:08,220
29 seconds!

4609
04:54:11,200 --> 04:54:12,660
Holy cow!

4610
04:54:13,420 --> 04:54:14,860
That's insane.

4611
04:54:20,240 --> 04:54:22,400
I feel self-conscious.

4612
04:54:24,520 --> 04:54:26,740
When you guys see my profile...

4613
04:54:26,740 --> 04:54:29,240
This is literally the least surprising thing ever.

4614
04:54:29,340 --> 04:54:32,100
I know, but I didn't expect you to see it.

4615
04:54:36,040 --> 04:54:37,660
Get me out of here.

4616
04:54:39,920 --> 04:54:42,380
I feel exposed, though.

4617
04:54:42,420 --> 04:54:44,100
I still feel exposed.

4618
04:54:45,320 --> 04:54:47,320
I still feel exposed.

4619
04:54:49,080 --> 04:54:49,960
Nice.

4620
04:54:52,820 --> 04:54:53,700
Well,

4621
04:55:02,710 --> 04:55:03,390
we did that.

4622
04:55:05,270 --> 04:55:06,830
We did that.

4623
04:55:08,490 --> 04:55:09,810
I like the monkey one.

4624
04:55:09,890 --> 04:55:10,590
It's pretty fast.

4625
04:55:10,890 --> 04:55:11,830
I mean, fun.

4626
04:55:18,750 --> 04:55:21,590
New viewers, this is how you know it's not a bit.

4627
04:55:27,590 --> 04:55:28,050
No!

4628
04:55:28,370 --> 04:55:30,310
I always do it for the bit.

4629
04:55:34,770 --> 04:55:36,910
Did I get all the warps, at least?

4630
04:55:40,730 --> 04:55:42,450
I think I got all the warps.

4631
04:55:43,050 --> 04:55:43,410
Yeah.

4632
04:55:45,270 --> 04:55:47,030
I got all the warps, at least.

4633
04:55:48,670 --> 04:55:50,430
Hi man, this is Jukedo's cousin.

4634
04:55:51,130 --> 04:55:55,410
I know he mentioned his birthday last stream, but he's a shy boy and didn't ask for a birthday song.

4635
04:55:56,550 --> 04:55:59,690
I was hoping we could surprise him when he watches the VOD later.

4636
04:56:06,250 --> 04:56:07,830
You're so sweet!

4637
04:56:09,830 --> 04:56:11,310
Of course we can.

4638
04:56:13,030 --> 04:56:13,990
Of course we can.

4639
04:56:15,510 --> 04:56:16,070
JAKAIDO!

4640
04:56:16,490 --> 04:56:17,050
JAKAIDO!

4641
04:56:17,830 --> 04:56:18,730
Potato, potato.

4642
04:56:19,230 --> 04:56:22,470
I can't believe... I can't believe you're a shy boy.

4643
04:56:22,550 --> 04:56:23,150
I cannot believe.

4644
04:56:24,150 --> 04:56:26,270
I can't believe it.

4645
04:56:27,210 --> 04:56:30,250
Of course I will sing you happy birthday.

4646
04:56:31,890 --> 04:56:35,370
Happy birthday to you.

4647
04:56:35,990 --> 04:56:38,850
Happy birthday to you.

4648
04:56:39,530 --> 04:56:42,530
Happy birthday JAKAIDO, JAKAIDO.

4649
04:56:42,790 --> 04:56:43,790
Potato, potato.

4650
04:56:44,230 --> 04:56:45,370
Avocado.

4651
04:56:48,470 --> 04:56:51,850
Happy birthday to you.

4652
04:56:54,930 --> 04:56:55,810
Happy birthday!

4653
04:56:58,170 --> 04:57:00,970
Never feel too shy to ask for a birthday song.

4654
04:57:03,990 --> 04:57:05,070
I hope you enjoyed the VOD.

4655
04:57:05,410 --> 04:57:06,310
I hope you got this far.

4656
04:57:08,730 --> 04:57:10,210
I hope you got this far.

4657
04:57:12,310 --> 04:57:17,230
Guys, I actually started crying for my little robots.

4658
04:57:17,450 --> 04:57:18,810
My little astrobots.

4659
04:57:18,910 --> 04:57:20,030
I missed them so much.

4660
04:57:30,320 --> 04:57:39,600
I have an astrobot fan that I got from TGS.

4661
04:57:41,400 --> 04:57:42,500
I'm first!

4662
04:57:43,260 --> 04:57:46,100
But I hope they make some plushies and stuff.

4663
04:57:48,300 --> 04:57:50,460
I hope they make some astrobot plushies.

4664
04:57:50,540 --> 04:57:51,180
I'd buy those.

4665
04:57:54,440 --> 04:57:55,940
Sorry princess, thank you!

4666
04:57:57,640 --> 04:57:58,680
They had those?

4667
04:57:58,700 --> 04:57:58,980
Yeah!

4668
04:58:00,040 --> 04:58:00,920
They did.

4669
04:58:02,720 --> 04:58:03,240
Wait...

4670
04:58:04,220 --> 04:58:05,780
It's somewhere in my room.

4671
04:58:06,820 --> 04:58:07,680
I have it somewhere.

4672
04:58:08,600 --> 04:58:09,580
I had to get one.

4673
04:58:09,660 --> 04:58:11,600
I was like, I need the astrobot.

4674
04:58:13,380 --> 04:58:15,340
All three of their popcorns.

4675
04:58:15,860 --> 04:58:16,820
Oh, you too.

4676
04:58:18,320 --> 04:58:18,960
I got it!

4677
04:58:19,520 --> 04:58:19,900
I got it!

4678
04:58:25,870 --> 04:58:27,950
Oh my god, the monkey is so close.

4679
04:58:29,210 --> 04:58:31,330
I'm just trying to look at our PS5.

4680
04:58:39,070 --> 04:58:41,230
I love the controller, but it's so expensive.

4681
04:58:42,070 --> 04:58:43,350
Wait, astrobot controller?

4682
04:58:43,490 --> 04:58:44,170
I haven't seen it.

4683
04:58:45,730 --> 04:58:47,110
There's an astrobot Nendo?

4684
04:58:47,290 --> 04:58:47,550
Really?

4685
04:58:50,070 --> 04:58:50,470
Seriously?

4686
04:58:51,110 --> 04:58:56,450
I want one so... I want little astrobot plushies so bad.

4687
04:58:57,470 --> 04:58:59,170
My little astrobots.

4688
04:58:59,450 --> 04:59:01,170
Hey, stop sleeping on the job!

4689
04:59:01,650 --> 04:59:02,670
They're laughing at him.

4690
04:59:03,250 --> 04:59:04,070
What happened?

4691
04:59:04,210 --> 04:59:05,470
Why are they laughing at him?

4692
04:59:07,270 --> 04:59:08,030
What's wrong?

4693
04:59:08,090 --> 04:59:08,630
What happened?

4694
04:59:09,490 --> 04:59:11,910
Why are these guys meditating under here?

4695
04:59:13,050 --> 04:59:14,690
There's so much going on.

4696
04:59:17,330 --> 04:59:20,550
Oh my gosh, I've never been such a fan of a mascot before.

4697
04:59:26,400 --> 04:59:27,840
Oh, he had no arms?

4698
04:59:32,520 --> 04:59:35,340
I forgot that the triangle calls for them.

4699
04:59:35,920 --> 04:59:36,080
Wait.

4700
04:59:36,800 --> 04:59:39,640
Oh no, I guess we'll never know if he had no arms or not.

4701
04:59:41,140 --> 04:59:42,540
Oh my god, they're all here!

4702
04:59:43,380 --> 04:59:47,720
Wait, let's go to a good spot and wish our little astrobots farewell.

4703
04:59:49,860 --> 04:59:51,360
It feels like Mother Base.

4704
04:59:51,460 --> 04:59:52,760
I know, right?

4705
04:59:53,280 --> 04:59:54,020
Oh, hi Spyro.

4706
04:59:57,820 --> 04:59:58,300
Raiden?

4707
04:59:58,520 --> 04:59:59,220
Or Snake?

4708
05:00:00,280 --> 05:00:01,580
Tell me where he is.

4709
05:00:02,340 --> 05:00:05,540
Within this group of... Oh my gosh, there's so many of them.

4710
05:00:06,600 --> 05:00:07,940
Look at our army.

4711
05:00:08,080 --> 05:00:08,720
Oh, there he is!

4712
05:00:10,580 --> 05:00:11,540
Fellow astrobots!

4713
05:00:12,840 --> 05:00:14,540
It has been an honor...

4714
05:00:15,580 --> 05:00:17,380
fighting alongside you!

4715
05:00:23,510 --> 05:00:24,750
Press down to dance?

4716
05:00:24,990 --> 05:00:26,010
Let's dance!

4717
05:00:28,490 --> 05:00:30,390
Oh my gosh, bot-bot revolution.

4718
05:00:34,970 --> 05:00:36,410
Oh whoops, I didn't mean to do that.

4719
05:00:36,510 --> 05:00:36,650
Wait.

4720
05:00:37,230 --> 05:00:37,510
Hold on.

4721
05:00:37,590 --> 05:00:38,030
Keep dancing!

4722
05:00:38,030 --> 05:00:40,030
Keep dancing!

4723
05:00:48,130 --> 05:00:50,850
This has been such a fun game.

4724
05:00:52,730 --> 05:00:54,690
Sorry it took me so long to beat.

4725
05:00:57,650 --> 05:01:03,270
Because I would have some times when I wouldn't stream it in a week or something would happen.

4726
05:01:03,490 --> 05:01:06,770
But I'm so glad we could at least complete the game.

4727
05:01:06,950 --> 05:01:08,190
Oh my gosh, I'm doing like the Carlton.

4728
05:01:13,170 --> 05:01:15,230
No, so much fun.

4729
05:01:15,670 --> 05:01:17,090
So, so much fun.

4730
05:01:17,210 --> 05:01:18,630
Look at Big Boss over there.

4731
05:01:18,710 --> 05:01:18,990
Wow!

4732
05:01:19,290 --> 05:01:22,490
Thanks for the fun playthrough.

4733
05:01:22,970 --> 05:01:23,790
Thank you!

4734
05:01:24,310 --> 05:01:25,450
Thank you, thank you!

4735
05:01:26,170 --> 05:01:27,690
That's so much fun.

4736
05:01:33,010 --> 05:01:37,630
Maybe I'll come back and get the rest of the puzzle pieces or something.

4737
05:01:38,190 --> 05:01:41,170
Or I'll film myself getting the final puzzle piece.

4738
05:01:41,170 --> 05:01:45,190
I'll record it or something and I'll post it somewhere.

4739
05:01:45,870 --> 05:01:46,270
Something.

4740
05:01:46,610 --> 05:01:48,410
Or maybe if I go out of town again.

4741
05:01:48,610 --> 05:01:49,670
Actually, that's a good idea.

4742
05:01:49,790 --> 05:01:51,330
I could record a VOD.

4743
05:01:51,930 --> 05:01:55,870
I could record it for when I go out of town and then I can just post it.

4744
05:01:58,050 --> 05:01:59,510
So I'll do that sometime.

4745
05:02:02,010 --> 05:02:05,050
I feel like it's been a while since I've seen a game filled with so much love.

4746
05:02:05,110 --> 05:02:06,810
It really makes me so happy to see.

4747
05:02:06,930 --> 05:02:07,470
I know!

4748
05:02:08,230 --> 05:02:09,670
Thank you for playing this, Mintos.

4749
05:02:09,770 --> 05:02:10,390
It's been a lot of fun.

4750
05:02:10,490 --> 05:02:11,230
Thanks, Takezo!

4751
05:02:13,590 --> 05:02:16,430
Let's not think about those 38 bots still stuck on those planets.

4752
05:02:16,530 --> 05:02:17,150
I'll get them.

4753
05:02:17,670 --> 05:02:18,470
I'll get them.

4754
05:02:18,550 --> 05:02:20,530
And then I'll record...

4755
05:02:23,850 --> 05:02:25,610
Nobody is immune to the floss.

4756
05:02:26,270 --> 05:02:27,710
Everybody must floss together.

4757
05:02:29,210 --> 05:02:30,990
Spyro is not a part of this though.

4758
05:02:31,170 --> 05:02:32,770
Spyro doesn't give a shit.

4759
05:02:33,370 --> 05:02:34,170
Spyro is...

4760
05:02:37,470 --> 05:02:38,950
The mass floss.

4761
05:02:40,850 --> 05:02:43,530
Oh my god, it's kind of terrifying though.

4762
05:02:47,510 --> 05:02:50,030
Yeah, I will beat the game.

4763
05:02:50,870 --> 05:02:55,770
And I will record it as a VOD and then when I'm gone sometime I'll post it for you guys.

4764
05:02:57,370 --> 05:02:58,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4765
05:03:02,830 --> 05:03:04,410
We'll see the bots again.

4766
05:03:04,610 --> 05:03:06,330
Just not for a while probably.

4767
05:03:19,640 --> 05:03:20,640
Funky tonight!

4768
05:03:21,300 --> 05:03:23,280
Thank you guys for the fun stream.

4769
05:03:23,340 --> 05:03:24,000
I had so much fun.

4770
05:03:24,060 --> 05:03:25,460
I hope you enjoyed Astro Bot.

4771
05:03:25,920 --> 05:03:31,520
And I will see you guys in the next time we Astro Bot and next stream.

4772
05:03:31,780 --> 05:03:32,900
I will be streaming tomorrow.

4773
05:03:33,800 --> 05:03:35,660
Not quite sure what yet actually.

4774
05:03:36,060 --> 05:03:36,920
But I will stream tomorrow.

4775
05:03:37,280 --> 05:03:40,440
I'll have a waiting room up either tonight or in the morning.

4776
05:03:40,940 --> 05:03:43,220
And yeah, this game was insanely cute.

4777
05:03:43,220 --> 05:03:44,100
And same with Mito.

4778
05:03:45,720 --> 05:03:46,600
Thank you so much.

4779
05:03:46,940 --> 05:03:48,820
Thank you for playing through it.

4780
05:03:48,840 --> 05:03:49,540
It was so much fun.

4781
05:03:49,640 --> 05:03:50,820
Thank you so much!

4782
05:03:51,040 --> 05:03:51,980
Thank you, thank you.

4783
05:03:53,720 --> 05:03:54,200
Otsubito!

4784
05:03:55,480 --> 05:03:59,720
I'm gonna go to sleep knowing Mint got 100k plays in our stream.

4785
05:04:00,440 --> 05:04:01,160
Shut up!

4786
05:04:02,720 --> 05:04:03,520
Shut up!

4787
05:04:06,640 --> 05:04:07,120
Otsubito!

4788
05:04:08,280 --> 05:04:09,240
Bye bye!

4789
05:04:09,920 --> 05:04:10,660
Wait, wait, wait.

4790
05:04:10,660 --> 05:04:12,520
Before I say bye bye.

4791
05:04:23,830 --> 05:04:24,770
Bye bye!

4792
05:04:25,590 --> 05:04:27,030
Wait, I wanna be next to Snake.

4793
05:04:29,430 --> 05:04:30,390
Bye bye!

4794
05:05:41,050 --> 05:05:45,270
That person before that said you needed that area with the 250.

4795
05:05:46,150 --> 05:05:47,590
I thought you meant the map.

4796
05:05:47,730 --> 05:05:48,170
Or the puzzle.

4797
05:05:48,230 --> 05:05:48,930
Finishing the puzzle.

4798
05:05:49,070 --> 05:05:50,710
That you would need 250 guys afterwards.

4799
05:05:51,150 --> 05:05:53,010
But there's another part of the map that needs 250.

4800
05:05:54,070 --> 05:05:55,810
I completely forgot about it.

4801
05:05:56,150 --> 05:05:57,470
Oh my god.

4802
05:05:57,470 --> 05:05:58,110
You were right.

4803
05:05:58,190 --> 05:05:59,110
You were probably like...

4804
05:05:59,110 --> 05:06:00,210
She doesn't understand what I mean.

4805
05:06:00,630 --> 05:06:02,990
Oh no, Mito, no!

4806
05:06:04,550 --> 05:06:05,550
I'm sorry!

4807
05:06:06,230 --> 05:06:07,570
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

4808
05:06:08,930 --> 05:06:10,350
We'll get it though.

4809
05:06:10,430 --> 05:06:12,210
I'll get it when I record.

4810
05:06:13,030 --> 05:06:13,630
All good.

4811
05:06:13,850 --> 05:06:14,750
No worries.

4812
05:06:15,130 --> 05:06:15,970
You silly boy.

4813
05:06:17,750 --> 05:06:18,430
All good.

4814
05:06:18,810 --> 05:06:19,410
