00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,870
Hello!

4
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,590
Hello!

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,270
Everyone!

6
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,470
Hello!

7
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,470
Do we have a hello for Denchi in general?

8
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,190
Ohha Denchi?

9
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,790
Ohha Denchi?

10
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,470
Ohha Denchi?

11
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,010
Ohha Denchi?

12
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,070
I mean, we do have our intro.

13
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,850
Like, Yure, you know?

14
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,850
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,650
Goodbye, but not for hello.

16
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,330
MVP South.

17
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,450
MVP South.

18
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,010
MVP.

19
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,390
I'm pleased to meet you, I just saw in chat.

20
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,150
That's a good one.

21
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,190
Oh, that's cute.

22
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,610
MVP South.

23
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:08,690
Yay.

24
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,030
I love it, I love it, I love it.

25
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,570
Let's use that, then.

26
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,570
Remember, you guys, at the very end, we're going to say MVPs
out.

27
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,090
For the hello, I guess.

28
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,410
I've tried.

29
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,530
Thank you guys for your input on the sound balance in the
chat.

30
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:37,470
I have now tried to balance it out, but feel free to keep
putting more input in there.

31
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,450
Yeah, you're at my house now.

32
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,550
Or my lack of a house.

33
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,910
Oh, it smells so good.

34
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,910
You're a beautiful house.

35
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,750

38
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,070
flowers and bugs oh i thought you said there were bugs in
the cookies i mean that would be extra protein And it's

39
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,170
basically the same as putting protein powder in, right?

40
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,990

Are those the heads?

43
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,010
They're just the heads.

44
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,110
They're just the heads.

45
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:27,990

For the fan club and in the Discord server.

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,350

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,810
Yeah, thank you.

53
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,070
I'm just yapping with you guys all the time.

54
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,970
It's been really fun.

55
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,790
And the emotes are so good.

56
00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,810
They're so awesome.

57
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,590
I love them.

58
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,170
They're very us.

59
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,890
We have your guys' favorite.

60
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,270
Mine is Phoebe 6'7".

61
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,790
I knew you were going to say that.

62
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,570
What about you?

63
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,910
What about you, Phoebe?

64
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,750
What's your favorite?

65
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,870
Mine?

66
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,070
I kind of...

67
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,670
Out of all of these...

68
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,670
I guess...

69
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,390
I think...

70
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,670
The one...

71
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,470
Without... The one where...

72
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,730
It's not the head.

73
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,410
The headless Vicky is just very cute.

74
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,250
Headless Vicky!

75
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,590
Headless Vicky.

76
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,150
What is that called?

77
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,590
Oh, MVP shrug.

78
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,050
Like... Sometimes I feel like that.

79
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:43,930
I'm like, the brain.

80
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,970
Why does it think?

81
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,270
I don't...

82
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,830
Can I turn it off?

83
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,750
No brain, no think.

84
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,090
No brain, no think.

85
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,430
I just just ongabunga.

86
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,030
Ongabunga.

87
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,290
Ongabunga.

88
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,870
I don't know.

89
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,210
I feel like I can get a lot of use out of the sawed ones.

90
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,070
Three of just the head.

91
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,370
The sawing one is so good.

92
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:03,850
Yeah.

93
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,930
I love the ladder as well.

94
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,970
And you can make it as long as you like.

95
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,870
Yeah.

96
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,790
It's so long.

97
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,250
Yeah.

98
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,410
I challenge chat.

99
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,570
Somebody start the ladder and then make the longest.

100
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:18,990
ladder.

101
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,310
Make a really long ladder.

102
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,470
Make a really long ladder.

103
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,530
How long can the ladder go without a mento appearing?

104
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,190
Yeah, yeah without a mento.

105
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,330
Okay, you guys.

106
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,590
But it has to be sometimes a mento.

107
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,950
Sometimes.

108
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,370
Success.

109
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,530
Or it could be, it could be, oops, all mentos.

110
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,830
It could just be a million mentos climbing up a, climbing up
a ladder.

111
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,550
Where is she going?

112
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,850
Where could, where kind of heights will she reach?

113
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,830
Where is she going?

114
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,950
I'm glad I'm not afraid of heights.

115
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:57,410
Oops.

116
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,570
Oh, Minto.

117
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,710
Oh, no!

Yeah, thank you.

122
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,530
That's Mint trying to reach the cabinets in the kitchen.

123
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,810
Why would you say that?

124
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:24,730

to do that yeah we want to we want to be we want to be

plate yeah understandable understandable guys i had to use

127
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,090
my step stool today

128
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,210
Literally me.

129
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,290
Literally me every day.

130
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,810
Wait, you guys are tall.

131
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,830
So you have a little stool to get to the cupboards?

132
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,630
Yeah.

133
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,150
Oh, that's nice.

134
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,710
You could, like, decorate them with, like...

135
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,010
You could make them, like, pink and mint and decorate them
for each of your colors.

136
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,490
Let's decorate our stools together, mint.

137
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,430
Yeah.

138
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:12,850
Oh, yeah.

139
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,370
Wait, we should have, like, a stream where we decorate.

140
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,090
Yeah.

141
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,550
Bling out your stool.

142
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,130
Mine is pretty plain and needs to be decorated, I think.

143
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,470
Man, you guys are so lucky.

144
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:37,370
I was literally at a shrine yesterday with, like, lots of
gates, and I kept nearly hitting my head on the gates, you

145
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:37,530
know.

146
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,330
You guys don't have to live with stuff like that.

147
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,910
You don't have to constantly live in fear of things above
you.

148
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,130
It must be nice.

149
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,350
It must be nice.

150
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,430
I don't live.

151
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,470
Oh, that's true.

152
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,210
Yes, sorry.

153
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,230
She doesn't live.

154
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,940
Oh, no.

155
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,340
Would it anger the gods if you, like, bumped your head on
the...

156
00:11:59,340 --> 00:11:59,740
Oh, yeah.

157
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,380
Yeah, I don't know.

158
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,880
I was being so careful.

159
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,040
I was, like, I was, like, hunched over.

160
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,360
Just like, don't hit it.

161
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,720
Don't hit it.

162
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Don't hit it.

163
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,460
Don't hit it.

164
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,620
I have a question for you.

165
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
I see, you're so nice, though.

166
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,540
I heard that some tall people struggle with the kitchen in a
different way than us.

167
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,040
Some of them struggle with countertops being too low.

168
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:29,820
for them you've never had your shirt oh my god yeah really
yes my my sink every time i do the washing up it's like what

169
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:39,440

your struggles i've just selfishly thought of my own oh no

170
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,600
don't worry guys we we both have struggles in our own way
but we can we can help each other tall tall and short yes

171
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,180
full and short mvps guys yeah We threw the dishes.

172
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,860
You put away the dishes.

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Yes.

174
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,140
I would like to propose, though, a short-person area for
concerts.

175
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,960
Yeah, right?

176
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,040
Like how there's a girl's area sometimes at Japanese
concerts.

177
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,820
I would like a short-person area.

178
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,500
Please, please.

179
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,400
You must be this tall to enter the area.

180
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,620
I mean, I can get behind that.

181
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,980
I always feel bad at concerts.

182
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm like, It's like the constant fear of like I don't want
people not to see so I'm down for that.

183
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,980
I agree.

184
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,960
I agree with you guys.

185
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:34,080
Yeah Thank you for understanding the the proper courtesy at
concerts is for taller people to put the shorter people on

186
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:42,400
their shoulders Exactly Everybody is just stacked on each
other so yeah shoulders that everybody has a chance and then

187
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,360
you find a window after that you know You pair up yeah,
yeah, yeah and short person and then yeah all the tall

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:57,320
people short people people's stacks will find windows after
that and then then everyone's happy you must pair up yeah

189
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:08,020
and maybe we you know could even be like cheaper tickets for
stacking stacking ticket yes and you can say like three

190
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:15,200
short people on your shoulders discount three or it's like
the more short people you stack on your shoulders the more

191
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:23,580
of a discount you get like it's 10 discount for every We
could, like, they could install, like, monkey bars above,

192
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,920
above, so you could, like, grab on for stability.

193
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:26,880
Yeah!

194
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,340
You're so right!

195
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,000
We could just keep stacking people, everyone will have a
view.

196
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:33,680
Right!

197
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,240
Or if you, like, want to switch which tall person you're
sitting on during the show, you can, like, eye the person

198
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,380
next to you, and then use the monkey bars to make your way
over and switch with them.

199
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:43,980
You know?

200
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

201
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,020
Or you could just hang from the monkey bars and enjoy the
show.

202
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,640
Double doesn't work out, too.

203
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,840
Yeah, get those arms trained up.

204
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh my god, we're geniuses.

205
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,180
And that's how you end up.

206
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,700
That's how you get strong like Vicky and you were able to
lift your friends.

207
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,020
Yes!

208
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,420
I'm still training hard, guys.

209
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,900
I hope I'm going to be able to do it.

210
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,240
I'm going to do my best.

211
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,260
I know you can.

212
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,680
I know you can.

213
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,580
Definitely.

214
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,480
Thank you.

215
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,920
Thank you very much.

216
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,700
Yay.

217
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:24,700
That said, we were already doing a lot mental heavy lifting
right now but we're gonna have to do even more today in uh

218
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:35,500
in a say it on the beat slash say it on the word challenge
yeah uh i don't know if you guys so i actually hadn't heard

219
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:44,380
of these things until uh mento and vicky uh proposed the
idea and i was like why did i write those so then i looked

220
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,720
it up and i was like oh this is kind of like i mean like the
beat Reminds me of rhythm having a little bit.

221
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,900
It does.

222
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Oh, wait, guys.

223
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,780
Can I ask you one question?

224
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,800
Because chat is saying I'm ignoring it.

225
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,680
I didn't see it.

226
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,380
Guys, um, okay.

227
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,340
I need to know.

228
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,480
Do you shower every day or every other day?

229
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,720
This is important for the...

230
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,560
Oh, is it?

231
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,160
It depends.

232
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,860
Are you every day or every other day, people?

233
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,720
Yeah, thank you!

234
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,540
Thank you!

235
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,760
Chat!

236
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,860
Every other day is fine in Windsor!

237
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,940
In my opinion.

238
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,060
So, so this is, this is my answer.

239
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,500
I wash my body every day, but I wash my hair every other
day.

240
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,820
Uh, yeah, that's, that's also a good, a good idea.

241
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,880
Yes, yes, yes.

242
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,280
Are you a fellow stinky, Vicky?

243
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,800
I, I shower full stop every other day.

244
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
Every other day, man.

245
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,260
Uh, you don't need a shower every day, in my opinion.

246
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,620
Wait, Minto, are you a fellow, are you a stinky as well?

247
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,840
I guess so.

248
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,440
I don't know.

249
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,200
Like, it depends.

250
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:57,380
In Japanese summer I shower every day But alright, you don't
need it in winter guys Anyway, turns out 55% of my chat

251
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:05,900
Shower every day people So Shower every day ruins your skin
Okay, I need to debunk this This is why It depends on your

252
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,720
soap No?

253
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:16,000
Well, but also you're supposed to like Super, super lotion
yourself up After every single shower Like, don't you?

254
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,820
Don't you lotion?

255
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:18,960
Moisturize?

256
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,940
Yeah, but...

257
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,080
No, I'm talking to chat!

258
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm like, oh, you're like, oh, showering every day is
gonna...

259
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,760

No, yes?

261
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:29,960
Moisturize!

262
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
Yeah, boys, if you have time to shower, you have time to
moisturize!

263
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:34,940
Yeah!

264
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,520
Don't give me that chat!

265
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,100
Yeah!

266
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,360
Now I'm getting on my fellow everyday shower...

267
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,820
Wait, no, no, no.

268
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,740
I'm getting on the not everyday showers.

269
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,560
I don't know if I'll shower today.

270
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,780
Yeah, just see what happens.

271
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,680
Go with the wind.

272
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:57,060
the wind takes me chat okay i don't know listen listen
anyway sorry yes please continue say it on the beat yes

273
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:04,460
sorry yeah say it on the beat so we have a bunch of
challenges we have downloaded from both tick tock and

274
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:11,720
youtube and the the curse thing about this is that none of
this is going to be on the beat none of it will be because

275
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:21,540
we're on discord chat we're doing discord screen share It's
going to look great!

276
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,040
Extra, extra...

277
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:24,800
Yes.

278
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,800
Do we want to...

279
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,380
So we're doing it all together, right?

280
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,060
Oh, yes, we're doing...

281
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,540
Well, unless we want to try individually, but I think it's
funner...

282
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,040
It's funnier if we do it all together.

283
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,840
I think we could maybe do each person individually and then
last all together.

284
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,420
Or do you guys want to do that?

285
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,200
Or do you guys want to do only just all together?

286
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:55,300
try it, try it ourselves, embarrass ourselves, and then do
it together, and then not be embarrassed anymore, because

287
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,400
we're all terrible.

288
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,300
Sounds good to me.

289
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,700
Sounds good.

290
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,620
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,460
Okay.

292
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,660
Okay.

293
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,470
Let's do it.

294
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,100
Alright.

295
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,640
Alright, alright.

296
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,620
Also, I'm sorry, I don't know why my chat's not working in
the back.

297
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,000
I might as We'll just get rid of the chat box at that point.

298
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,580
There you go.

299
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,980
What's the secret third thing?

300
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,160
Oh, well, I voted for that one.

301
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,260
I did too.

302
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,320
Oh, what is this?

303
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,480
I do a secret post it is, but we agree.

304
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,940
Secrets?

305
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,580
I love secrets.

306
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,300
There we go.

307
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,660
I'll vote that one.

308
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,880
Not just the face.

309
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,080
You moisturize more than just the face.

310
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,840
Also the rest of your body.

311
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,660
Crusty.

312
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,720
Crusty.

313
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,480
Denchies.

314
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,560
I mean unless you like adding texture to your body I guess
then then maybe like a lizard like a lizard

315
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:12,960
that's appealing to me here here's the first of our say say
the word on the beat challenges are you guys ready do you

316
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:22,260
want to gum yeah do you want to gum baru first as having no
ping like and then sure but also mine's gonna be slightly

317
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:34,220
off too because whenever i play audio from the desktop it's
slightly off from from my voice um so this is this is this

318
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:43,000
is about how scuffed it'll be with no ping and then imagine
that but even more scuffed when the other two do it so So,

319
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,640
here we go.

320
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,600
I'll give it a try.

321
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,240
Dog,

322
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,100
dog, dog, dog, cat,

323
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,580
cat.

324
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,020
You guys were doing the same thing, but...

325
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,160
So, how was that, chat?

326
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,540
I think that's a rat.

327
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,380
I don't think that's a cat.

328
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean, a...

329
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,520
Oh, it's a rat!

330
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,640
A

331
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,400
maim!

332
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm sorry if this is, like, animal profiling or something,
but the cats, I mean, mice and rats are, like, the same to

333
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,040
me.

334
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,440
They're not!

335
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,960
No!

336
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,560
How?

337
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,740
Okay, wait.

338
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,020
They're both cute to me.

339
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,360
So, what do you mean how dare?

340
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,600
Are we, are we like...

341
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Do we hate?

342
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,060
Do we not like one of them?

343
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,220
You can tell by the tail.

344
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,120
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

345
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,240
That's like big.

346
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,080
When I've seen them in person in London wandering around,
they're big.

347
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,220
Looking at this...

348
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,720
What's the difference between the tails?

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,120
I don't know.

350
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,060
What?

351
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,560
You told me the difference isn't in the tail.

352
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,600
What was the difference?

353
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,060
Just gaslighting for those.

354
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,740
Dude, I'm getting gaslit, gas boss, gas kept.

355
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,220
Oh my gosh.

356
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,700
Rat tails are big and long.

357
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,660
I think you're right though.

358
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,720
Yeah, they're just big.

359
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,320
They're just big.

360
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,120
The tails are big.

361
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,080
Maybe it is a mouse.

362
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,460
I thought because it's cat and then it's rat.

363
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,780
You would think so.

364
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,920
You might actually be a mouse.

365
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,900
Oh, hold on.

366
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm so confused.

367
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,620
That's a mouse?

368
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,400
I just messaged me.

369
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,460
He said, tell Phoebe to turn off the BGM.

370
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,480
I think when we're doing the...

371
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,160
Oh, I didn't even realize it was on, sorry.

372
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,700
There you go.

373
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,580
Thank you.

374
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
But that was the...

375
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,020
That was the...

376
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,520
The...

377
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,020
Practice round, anyway.

378
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,160
Practice round.

379
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,140
Practice round.

380
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,440
That's a mouse?

381
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,500
It's fatter and more rotund, so it's a mouse.

382
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,020
So I was right.

383
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:22,960
What?

384
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,360
Gaslit, gas boss.

385
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,540
Gas kept.

386
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,140
I take back everything that I know.

387
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,580
No, it's okay.

388
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,280
We're learning.

389
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,060
We're learning.

390
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,000
That is not a peat rat.

391
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,080
It is a peat mouse.

392
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,180
But do you know the... Do you guys know the G-L-I-B-L-I-Pet
Rat Gumai Kandai video?

393
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:44,760
Yes.

394
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,200
What?

395
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,300
On G-L-I-B-Lai.

396
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,160
What did you just say?

397
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,120
What did you just say?

398
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,660
What did you just say?

399
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait, I need to show you.

400
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,480
Jelly belly, pet rat, gummy candy.

401
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:09,220
I will send it to you for watching later It's from one of my
favorite channels Run for the Cube I will send it to you for

402
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,960
consumption later At a later date Send it for later

403
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:24,710
Okay Oh my god July, July Heat rat, gumai, can't I

404
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,110
Unfortunately, I have most of that video memorized.

405
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,540
Anyway, intrusive thoughts aside.

406
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,520
It's all mouse.

407
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,580
And now, would you guys like to do the dog cat mouse
challenge together with me?

408
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,580
Send me in.

409
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,100
Okay.

410
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,540
Okay.

411
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:50,900
Here we go.

412
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,060
You guys can hear the audio from the screen share, right?

413
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,880
Yes.

414
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,560
Okay.

415
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,860
Let's do this thing.

416
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,500
Gambari mouse.

417
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,220
That's, you can hear the latency.

418
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,660
So, this is, this is, this is the stream.

419
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,220
Absolutely abysmal.

420
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,360
That's, that's the goal.

421
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,720
Yes.

422
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,740
It's like a kindergarten class trying to sing.

423
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,760
It was horrible.

424
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,560
Please continue.

425
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,180
Yay.

426
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,120
We got it.

427
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,360
No notes.

428
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,320
notes.

429
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,500
Oh, thanks, Jet.

430
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,500
There was passion.

431
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,780
That's, that's, that's what's important.

432
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,920
What's important is not the word or the beat.

433
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,620
It's the passion behind it.

434
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,120
The passion.

435
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:23,380
It's the heart that goes into every word as we passionately
say dog, dog, cat, cat, mouse, mouse, cat, dog.

436
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,320
Yes.

437
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,300
I think the more difficult, the more difficult it gets, the
more passion we should put into it.

438
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,660
Yeah.

439
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,320
I'm ready for level two.

440
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,600
Level two passion, let's go.

441
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,480
So level two, shall we...?

442
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,180
What is that?

443
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,580
Oh.

444
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,240

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:24,790
Howdy.

513
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:25,930
All right, here we go.

514
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,390
Here we go.

515
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,150
I'm ready.

516
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:28,790

00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,570
Burger, bacon, butter, bacon, butter, burger, burger, bacon.

520
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:37,790
Yeah.

521
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,130
Butter, burger, bacon, butter, boom, boy, bacon, burger,
burger.

522
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,370
Butter, bacon, burger.

523
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,560
Butter, bacon, burger, butter, boom.

524
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,760
Bacon, butter, bacon, burger, bacon, butter, boom.

525
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,230
Doesn't matter as long as she finishes.

526
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,630
You guys were here for the naturalization.

527
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,430
of our lovely British friend into Marfa.

528
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,450
Oh, thank you, thank you.

529
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,470
I'll do my best to be American, like you guys.

530
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,850
I'll do my best.

531
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,570
That was so good.

532
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,830
That was so good.

533
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,450
That was very good.

534
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,570
I think that when you do the Southern accent, it helps you
lock in.

535
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,250
Oh, thank you.

536
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:29,750
Thank you.

537
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,130
Thank you, Manto.

538
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,810
I'll walk in.

539
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,210
So does it help you to walk in if you do that?

540
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,810
I think so, yeah.

541
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,230
Wow.

542
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,610
It's so funny how you can hear how much worse the latency is
for Vicky.

543
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,590
Compatimenta!

544
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,690
I know!

545
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,310
Sorry, guys.

546
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,230
Oh.

547
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,050
That was so good.

548
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,450
That's my favorite one yet.

549
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,110
I'm excited for what's coming.

550
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:57,850
Yeah.

551
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,470
The butter bacon.

552
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,330
I guess I'll try.

553
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,910
Yeah, go, Phoebe!

554
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,390
Go, Phoebe, go!

It's crazy!

561
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,340
Oh, so good.

562
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,020
Perfect recipe for a perfect burger, you guys.

563
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,700
Yeah!

564
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,800
Butter bacon burger, boom, boom, boom.

565
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,600
Yeah.

566
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,680
What is the boom boom popping candy?

567
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,920
Lost green card acquired.

568
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,300
Oh my gosh.

569
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,080
Oh, I need to recover, okay.

570
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,420
You guys are so good at this, though.

571
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,280
You're so good.

572
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,460
I'm ready.

573
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,400
Let me load up the next one.

574
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,320
See, the word on the impossible.

575
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,960
Impossible!

576
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,220
Impossible!

577
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,300
What does that mean?

578
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,640
I don't remember what ones I chose, you guys, but there are
some meme ones.

579
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,420
Just like...

580
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,060
No, good.

581
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,500
Good.

582
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,960
Well, this entire thing feels like a meme to be fair, but...

583
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,120
That's true.

584
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,340
Okay.

585
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm excited.

586
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,260
I'm ready.

587
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,900
Are we gonna try this one together?

588
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,360
Do you want to try it individually?

589
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:07,000
I think we could do it together, right?

590
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,740
Yeah, let's do it together.

591
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,660
We'll do the first one together.

592
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,800
First try together.

593
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,020
Okay, okay.

594
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,060
Here we go.

595
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,080
Let's do it.

596
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,700
Godspeed.

597
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,690
Car bed, bed, car bed, star, star, star.

598
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,060
Who's that?

599
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,780
Red pair.

600
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,820
Oh, that's Ted?

601
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,960
Oh, it's Ted!

602
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,620
Oh, it's Ted!

603
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,610
I watched that movie.

604
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,410
And Dolgy Bear.

605
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,610
The Dolgy Bear.

606
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,030
Oh, that's why it's 10 and 10 and bread and bread.

607
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:04,990
Okay, okay, okay.

608
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,990
I feel like this one was easier than the bacon butter
burger.

609
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,490
Yeah, I think so.

610
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,230
Okay, we can do it individually if anybody wants to.

611
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,310
Yeah.

612
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,550
I believe.

613
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,410
I believe.

614
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,050
I will, I will lead the charge on this one next.

615
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,930
Maybe somehow you turned your BGM back on.

616
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:25,950
Oh, did I?

617
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,510
I didn't, huh?

618
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:29,810
Okay.

619
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,830
What is this poll?

620
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,870
Can I vote both?

621
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,770
It's exactly 50-50.

622
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,750
Oh no.

623
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,030
Whoa.

624
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:42,750
Come on.

625
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,390
It has to be exactly 50-50.

626
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:44,850
Please.

627
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:45,810
Lock in.

628
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,050
You guys.

629
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,290
Lock in.

630
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:46,770
Oh, it's 50-50.

631
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,130
There!

632
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,310
There!

633
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,550
It was 50-50 for a second!

634
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,550
You failed.

635
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,570
You couldn't walk in.

636
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,550
I really believed in you.

637
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,290

Bed, car, star, star, star, jar.

00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,790
Red dead, red dead.

654
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,450
Oh, God.

655
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,740
Red, red.

656
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,880
You locked in, though.

657
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,260
Lovely.

658
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,500
You locked in, though.

659
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,720
Oh, my gosh.

660
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,460
That was magnificent, Minto.

661
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,940
Very impressive.

662
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,220
Now she got the British seal of approval.

663
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes, absolutely.

664
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,160
You may have your British citizenship, Minto.

665
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,780
Here you go.

666
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,420
I'll take a cup of that.

667
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:58,780
Oh, my gosh.

668
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,820
We're just all exchanging citizenships at this point.

669
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,520
Just trading.

670
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:15,520
training citizenships yeah oh my god i'm so good all right

672
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,400
this time again again here we go

673
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,650
jaka jaka jaka

674
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,270
I feel like

675
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,010
I'm doing a mix and then ending it with ja-ja-ja

676
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,780
That'd be so fun.

677
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,200
That'd be so fun if it exists.

678
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:30,860
Yeah.

679
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,700
I...

680
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:42,560
considering this is from like Normie TikTok I doubt it
exists but but it doesn't mean it can't be born it can be

681
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,940
chop it up a red bread chop it up a red bread

682
00:39:50,300 --> 00:40:02,120
oh that'd be amazing we can make it exist yeah now we're
British and also American American as well American American

683
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,800
I like how Our voices drop.

684
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,480
The pitch drops as soon as we put on the southern accent for
some reason.

685
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,200
It helped me lock in.

686
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,680
I was just laughing too much.

687
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,280
Yeah.

688
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,600
It was real good.

689
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,740
Red bread redemption.

690
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,080
Yummy.

691
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,580
Yes.

692
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,300
So.

693
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,160
All right.

694
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,780
This is going swimmingly so far, I do think.

695
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,680
Yeah, I think so.

696
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,400
going exactly as expected.

697
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,460
I think.

698
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:36,940
Yeah.

699
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,460
Was that supposed to be the impossible level?

700
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,760
That was not impossible.

701
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,400
That was not impossible.

702
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,560
This one just is very hard.

703
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,160
Way harder.

704
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,260
Yeah, the burger one was super hard.

705
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,020
It was really hard.

706
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,120
I feel like there was just not enough syllables.

707
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,100
Like, there was not enough space for the syllables of butter
and burger.

708
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:55,840
Yeah.

709
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,280
Yeah, that one was so hard.

710
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,500
Oh, raccoon was hard.

711
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,740
Spoon, moon, raccoon.

712
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:13,520
it was hard too balloon balloon it's hard so far i'm
expecting this one to be easy peasy if the last level was

713
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:22,340
impossible level is very hard okay yeah we got this we can
do a little tricy shall we all right here we go all together

714
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,040
all together first okay

715
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:56,690
Sorry.

716
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,150
This one's kind of loud there.

717
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,190
What'd you say?

718
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:02,990
What'd you say, Vicky?

719
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,770
Oh, no, oh, nothing.

720
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,810
Oh, nothing.

721
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,270
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,250
I think I mistook the color there for something else by
accident.

723
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,990
Whatever could you miss?

724
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,930
I was clearly green.

725
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,090
Why would you say any other color?

726
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:19,570
Oh, so sorry.

727
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,050
Oh, so sorry.

728
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,530
I must have slipped in judgment for a second.

729
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,470
So sorry, guys.

730
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,970
I'm so sorry.

731
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,970
I reckon we got this.

732
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,110
I reckon we got this.

733
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,730
Yeah, I reckon we got this.

734
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,110
You know what?

735
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,810
Mint is the color expert.

736
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,610
So do you want to go first, Mint, and show us how it's done.

737
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:43,310
Sure.

738
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:43,990
I'll go first.

739
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,650
Yeah.

740
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,190
Here we go.

741
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,510
Green,

742
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,380
green, green, green, green, green.

743
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,380
Green, green, green.

744
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,500
Well, that's how it's done.

745
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,140
Wow.

746
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,360
How do you roll your R's like that?

747
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,180
No.

748
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,460
You can do it, Phoebe.

749
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,080
You can do it.

750
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,280
I think she's drowning.

751
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:44,880
Oh god.

752
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,280
I'm gonna try then.

753
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,820
I'm gonna try.

754
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,700
Go, go, go!

755
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,520
Go, go!

756
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,920
Hey, one, two, go!

757
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:58,680
Hey,

758
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,350
one, two, go!

759
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,170
I

760
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,400
think!

761
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,000
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!

762
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,800
It's a sink!

763
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,220
It sounds like you're drowning!

764
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,770
I may be drowning in the sink.

765
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,670
The ice melting.

766
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,130
in the sink, and now I'm drowning in it.

767
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:51,550
No!

768
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,490
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

769
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,330
How about you, Vicky?

770
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,750
Can you roll your R's?

771
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,650
I'll try.

772
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:04,930
Yeah!

773
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,190
You're just letting me for real, for real.

774
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,090
Okay.

775
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:09,970
Put me in, coach.

776
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,450
You got this.

777
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,590
You got this.

778
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:13,490
Woo!

779
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:19,470
And if you don't, I'll still love you as your comrade and
not being able to roll ours.

780
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,970
Aw, thanks, baby.

781
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,590
Here we go.

782
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,930
She's hacking up a hairball.

783
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,690
Here we go.

784
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:35,950
I'm going.

00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:36,430

786
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,290
Okay.

787
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:39,850

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,870

Well, we know her type now.

796
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,700
And what type is that exactly?

797
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,860
What type is that?

798
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,380

It's just Shadow the Hedgehog.

806
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:25,300
Yeah.

807
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,160
No one else has a chance.

808
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,780
No one else.

809
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,740

810
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,880

00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,560
Shadow, shadow, marrow, shadow.

814
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
Macho, shadow.

815
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:45,880
Okay.

816
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,940
But if we, if, if people were to make say it on the beat
challenges for the three of us.

817
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,960
Then what kind of words would they contain?

818
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:56,740
I wonder.

819
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,060
Hmm.

820
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,100
Hmm.

821
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,000
Don't say durian.

822
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,960
Not durian.

823
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,140
Not durian.

824
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,060
Durian would be hard.

825
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,560
Durian.

826
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,420
That's three silver.

827
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,960
Durian, durian, durian, durian, durian.

828
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,120
I saw, there was one that I saw when I was looking for these
that was just all sushi.

829
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,160
And it's like actually impossible.

830
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:17,720
Whisp?

831
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,680
That's just cruel.

832
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,220
That's just cruel.

833
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,160
They're like whisp.

834
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,180
That's so mean.

835
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,040
Healthy!

836
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,300
Stop getting and pregnant.

837
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,020
What?

838
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,040
Stop, stop getting, getting, getting pregnant, pregnant.

839
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,610
I did that one perfectly.

840
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,110
Get pregnant, get, get, get, get pregnant.

841
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,770
I think that's what we need.

842
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:54,370
Why is that the second time we've talked about this this
week?

843
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,430
Six, six, seven, seven, seven, seven, six, seven, six,
seven.

844
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,660
Oh, someone said they saw a UMA version.

845
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,260
Oh.

846
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,060
That would be fun.

847
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,560
Hardest levels had Makitane.

848
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,680
Oh god.

849
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,020
Oh god.

850
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,920
Oh my god.

851
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,480
Okay.

852
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,440
Oh.

853
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,260
There's another one.

854
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,220
Another one.

855
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:26,640
There's more?

856
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,600
Yeah.

857
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,040
Comment 6-7 if you will see this.

858
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,040
Do it!

859
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,400
Do it!

860
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,420
Are you alive?

861
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,280
Those of you guys on stream, do you see this?

862
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,640
Are you seeing this?

863
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,540
Do it.

864
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,140
That's crazy.

865
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,500
Please don't leave, Mint.

866
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:56,600
Please stay.

867
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,040
Mint, Mint, need I remind you that you're the one that
submitted this one?

868
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,340
I didn't see that part.

869
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:21,170
Okay.

870
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,410
All right, we're ready.

871
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:23,650
Okay.

00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:24,750
Here we go.

873
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:28,990
Okay.

874
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,950
We're ready.

875
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,620
Okay.

876
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,600

This one's alright!

884
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,660
I think it's not impossible.

885
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,880
That was something!

886
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,360
Yeah!

887
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,160

Yeah!

889
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,340
Did you want to do this individually?

890
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,520
Yeah.

891
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,420
Phoebe, you go first this time.

892
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,300
I'll do this one.

893
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,460
Do it, do it, Phoebe.

894
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,380
I'll do it, do it, do it!

895
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm an expert at bears and chairs and pears.

896
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,240
Pears.

897
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,460

00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,120
It was so nice.

921
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,080
It sounds so yummy.

922
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,520

That is so cruel!

934
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,680
What is wrong?

935
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,680
It's the chair.

936
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,240
The fairy chair.

937
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,400
The one that she gets cucked in.

938
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah, that one.

939
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
He doesn't...

940
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,540
Oh no!

941
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,140
Hold on, I knocked over a bunch of stuff when you said that.

942
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:48,960
Sorry, Barry.

943
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,880
I think you're cool and I like watching your dark soul
streams.

944
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,560
Okay.

945
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,320
Minto.

946
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,180
Minto, you can do it.

947
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,380
Do I have to say Barry?

948
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,100
No.

949
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,040
Only if your soul...

950
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,480
Only if your soul's soul tells you to.

951
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:11,580
Okay.

952
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,380
Here we go.

953
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,120
🎵 🎵 Everything

954
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,610
became a- Berrybug infested my brain.

955
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,750
🎵 🎵 And...

956
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,030
She infested your brain and she whispered to you, don't you
dare.

957
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:08,730
Don't you dare, pair, pair, pair, pair, pair, pair.

958
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:12,170
Don't you dare, put me in that chair with that pair.

959
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,690
I'm gonna, I can't bear it.

960
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:15,370
Bear it.

961
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,970
That one was, that one was actually not so bad.

962
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,150
Again, if it's like one syllable, it's not that bad.

963
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,710
Yeah, yeah, it's really not bad.

964
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,690
Very hard, it's lying.

965
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,830
Give us a real hard- oh god.

966
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,970
Oh, it's always like extreme.

967
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:36,630
Extreme!

968
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,790
Let's see how extreme it'll really get.

969
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,390
Yeah.

970
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:46,590
Uh, uh, everyone together, shall we?

971
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:47,050
Yep.

972
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:48,170
Yes.

973
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,210
Let's do it.

974
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,350
Skelly man.

975
00:55:54,390 --> 00:56:03,170
Seep, seep, seep, seep, seep, seep, seep, seep, seep, seep,
seep, seep, seep, seep, seep, Sleep deep.

976
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,210
Oh my god.

977
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:05,830
Sleep deep.

978
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:07,150
What?

979
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,450
Oh creep.

980
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:08,970
Creep.

981
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:09,470
Creep.

982
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:10,790
Creep.

983
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:16,890
Creep.

984
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:17,310
Creep.

985
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:17,450
Creep.

986
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:17,550
Creep.

987
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:17,970
Creep.

988
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:18,570
Creep.

989
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:25,300
This one is extreme.

990
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,280
The most extreme part of it though was figuring out what
that was supposed to be.

991
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,560
Yeah.

992
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,420
I threw him off like that.

993
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,060
groove.

994
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,580
Like, oh, that's so mean.

995
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:36,960
Look at him.

996
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,500
He's not a creep.

997
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,120
What if he's just a little guy and that's just the way he
stands.

998
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,220
You know?

999
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,200
Like, who else do we know that stands like that with their
hands out like that?

1000
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,200
I'm sure they're not a creep.

1001
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,420
Like, why?

1002
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,580
Like, how could they just make assumptions like that, you
know?

1003
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,820
Oh, oh, wait.

1004
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,680
I finally get it.

1005
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,400
Okay.

1006
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,470
It's like, why is Minto so sad?

1007
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:07,170
Then I was like,

1008
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,090
then it's not.

1009
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,490
I thought she knew someone who looked like this.

1010
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,740
Go man, go man, go man.

1011
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,700
What I'm saying is he's not, he's not a creep just for, just
for standing like that.

1012
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,400
He may, however, possibly.

1013
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,700
I'm working on my posture, okay?

1014
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,340
No, you're really, you're doing so, you're doing so well for
yourself.

1015
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,280
You are, you are, you are.

1016
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,120
You look better than that guy at least.

1017
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,780
Just play the look better than that guy.

1018
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,320
Maybe it's freak, not What creeps us chat?

1019
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,360
Oh, it could be freak.

1020
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,240
It could be freak.

1021
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,780
I love you, Vigil.

1022
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,020
I do.

1023
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:07,430
Weirdo.

Weirdo.

1025
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,780
You do belong here.

1026
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,570
Do the one first.

1027
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,950
Who would like to go first?

1028
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:32,630
You can go, Vicky.

1029
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,130
Okay, I'm ready.

1030
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:35,730
I'm so ready.

1031
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,650
Let's see what the agreement is on what that guy is called.

1032
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:40,520
Let's go.

1033
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:42,870

I wiggled so much I'm dizzy.

1064
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,280
I might have to just hold off on the wiggling.

1065
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,500
Oh no!

1066
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,380

Oh my god.

1081
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,890
No, you could compete, Minto.

1082
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,390
This is your calling.

1083
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:31,230
Whoa.

1084
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,370
Competitive aid on the beat.

1085
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:34,350
Oh my gosh.

1086
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:37,550
You had the concentration face on.

1087
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:38,750
I did.

1088
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:42,630
I was like, I was focused.

1089
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,430
Yeah.

1090
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,370
It's so good.

1091
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:45,290
Oh my god.

1092
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,470
It was a very good.

1093
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,550
Focus face.

1094
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,990
Thank you.

1095
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,110
Thank you.

1096
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,330
Engie face is the key.

1097
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,170
Oh, if Engie face is the key.

1098
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,730
Though, I don't think I can make an Engie face.

1099
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,570
That's pretty Engie.

1100
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,690
That's pouting for sure.

1101
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:04,930
Maybe that'll help with the next round.

1102
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,330
Put on your game face.

1103
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,230
Put on your game face.

1104
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,390
What do your guys' game faces look like?

1105
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,490
Show us your game face.

1106
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,960
Maybe this is not a laughing matter.

1107
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,500
Oh, I'm sorry, Ray.

1108
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,460
I need to lock it.

1109
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,380
I need to lock it.

1110
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:29,680
I need to lock it.

1111
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,900
You're super serious.

1112
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,100
Well, this next one doesn't have a difficulty listed.

1113
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:37,680
Oh, okay.

1114
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,720
That's scary.

1115
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:39,660
That is scary.

1116
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,180
It's a wild card.

1117
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,520
They're like, this is serious business.

1118
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,280
You want to know how difficult it is?

1119
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,160
Do it.

1120
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,280
Just got to just focus.

1121
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,160
Just go in.

1122
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:48,520
Yeah.

1123
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,280
Lock in.

1124
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:50,780
I'm ready.

1125
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:51,220
Lock it.

1126
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:51,960
Mm-hmm.

1127
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,240
You guys ready?

1128
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,040

Fly, fly, fly, fly.

So...

1134
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:34,190
I think this disproves our theory of everything with one
syllable being easy.

1135
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:35,390
Yeah.

1136
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,390
It's hard.

1137
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,990

01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,110
Was that like when you like do extra flips in a game and it
gives you style points?

1160
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,770
Like, is that what that was?

You can do this.

1166
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:31,870
I guess...

1167
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:32,370
What do you mean?

1168
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,030
I have an unfair advantage, guys.

1169
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:34,950

01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,470
What do you mean?

1171
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:38,210

01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:38,610

01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:41,770
Well, I don't know.

1176
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,070
I don't...

1177
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:44,850
The British.

1178
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:46,910
The British.

1179
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,170
Yeah, the British.

1180
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,150

01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,090
Yes.

1187
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,010
Alright, Phoebe, I believe in you.

1188
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:00,870
We persist.

1189
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:02,890
So that's what it is now.

1190
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:05,090
You can get style points by adding extra syllables.

1191
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:06,550
Okay.

1192
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:06,570

01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,960
That's the freak mix, for real.

1202
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,280
points.

1203
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,240
Yeah.

1204
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,340
Good job, you guys.

1205
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,240
Good job.

1206
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:00,860
Good job.

1207
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:01,800
We did amazing.

1208
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,780
Yeah.

1209
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:04,260
Yeah.

1210
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,220
See that.

1211
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,660
That's animal on the beat.

1212
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,080
That's fun.

1213
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:10,940
Okay.

1214
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,000
This is different.

1215
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:12,660
This is new.

1216
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,200
Okay.

1217
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,260
Let's give it a little try.

1218
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,020
Oh.

1219
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:26,460
Dogs can, dogs can, dogs can, dogs can, dogs can Dog can,
dogs, cats, dogs,

1220
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,260
cats.

1221
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:36,460
Okay, is that, is that a, what, okay, what are these?

1222
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,260
A bat?

1223
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:38,640
What?

1224
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,800
I think the first one is a bat.

1225
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:41,820
A bat, right?

1226
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,060
What's the next one?

1227
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,580
It's the one you're doing.

1228
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,520
Hold on, I'm gonna, um, computer enhance.

1229
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,680
I'm putting this up big on the screen right now.

1230
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:52,960
What?

1231
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,840
Oh god, don't make it bigger.

1232
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,680
I'm gonna make it even bigger for better visibility.

1233
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,440
What is happening?

1234
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:03,720
No.

1235
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,020
I do think one of them is a kangaroo.

1236
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,900
Yeah, I think that the third and the last one are a
kangaroo, I think.

1237
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,100
Yeah.

1238
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,380
I don't think they're real.

1239
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,360
Seriously, I don't think they're real.

1240
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,280
You don't think so?

1241
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,040
You don't think so?

1242
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,080
Okay, well what is the one with the big nose?

1243
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,820
That's not quite an elephant.

1244
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,360
Yeah.

1245
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,940
No, that's like a seal.

1246
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,720
A seal or seal.

1247
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,700
Or an elephant seal.

1248
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:27,520
Yeah, elephant seal.

1249
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,600
Would you have to say the full elephant seal?

1250
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,240
Is that what you're saying?

1251
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,900
Bat, bat, kangaroo, elephant seal, vulture?

1252
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,520
Elephant seal, bat kangaroo.

1253
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,140
I think a vulture.

1254
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,660
Elephant seal, bat kangaroo.

1255
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,720
No, I think they're made up.

1256
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,580
I've never seen these animals.

1257
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,140
These are animals from space.

1258
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,720
These are too easy.

Yeah.

1351
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:59,960
It says that male hammerheaded bats like to gather in huge
groups and crank up the volume with honking calls.

1352
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,520
Isn't that like, isn't that like freaking Woda gay people

1353
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:14,600
I was thinking those cats that look like the actor from Star
Wars that honk.

1354
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,620
This guy kind of looks similar too.

1355

01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,760
You guys know the guy that looks like the cat.

01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:39,860

1364
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,680
Actually, I don't think I know what you're talking about.

1365
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:50,120
No, okay, hold on.

1366
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:50,920

1368
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,240

01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,400
Okay, hold on.

1372
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,680

1376
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,600
Adam Driver looks like this cat.

1377
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,500
And they're famous for honking.

1378
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,740
And the honking cat also looks like the bat.

1379
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:22,820
Oh, my gosh.

1380
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,140
This cat does look like Adam Driver.

1381
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,700
Oh my gosh!

It's... I don't know actually what kind of cat this is.

1385
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,300
It's the honking cat.

1386
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,720
They just honk and they look like Adam Driver.

1387
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,960
Tell me that doesn't look like Kyla Ren to you guys.

Adam Driver's cat.

1389
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,420
And then it also looks like the hammerhead bat.

1390
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,720
It all comes together.

1391
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,180

01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,410
Wait, is this one we already did?

1430
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:14,990
Is it?

1431
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:15,970
Hold on, let's see.

1432
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:16,690
Let's see, yeah.

1433
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:18,610
It might be, yeah, we did this one.

1434
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,810
Oh, I think so, yeah, yeah.

1435
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:22,050
Okay, next one then.

1436
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:26,730
Oh, level is easy for this one.

1437
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:27,590
It was difficult.

1438
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:32,030
Okay, I haven't seen any that said easy yet, so...

1439
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,190
Hmm.

1440
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:34,690
Here we go, shall we?

1441
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:36,370
Yes.

1442
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:39,370
Don't quit school, Don't quit school.

1443
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:41,510
Go to school.

1444
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:42,350
Right.

1445
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:46,710
If you quit school, you're never going to become as good at,
say the word on the beat as we are.

1446
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:47,370
You know?

1447
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:48,310
Quit school.

1448
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:49,750
Quit school.

1449
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:50,590
Quit.

1450
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,010
Quit school.

1451
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,030
Don't go.

1452
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,210
Don't do your homework.

1453
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:56,250
Don't go to, on the school bus.

1454
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:57,530
Don't go to school.

1455
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:01,970
Instead, go to...

1456
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,350
Chuck your cheese.

1457
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:04,390
Oh!

1458
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:07,870
Okay, guys.

1459
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,290
I've never been to Chucky Cheese.

1460
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:13,250
What's the what's the what's the appeal?

1461
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,310
It's arcade with Anna.

1462
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:19,610
Well, they don't have animatronics anymore, but unfortunate.

1463
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:20,690
They got pizza.

1464
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,030
You can have a wedding at Chucky Cheese.

1465
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:24,930
What?

1466
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:25,430
What?

1467
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:27,710
I mean, actually, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

1468
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,570
And then Charles E.

1469
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:32,140
Cheese will come out and dance for you.

1470
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:33,510
Wow.

1471
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,090
Yeah.

1472
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:40,550
So like, when I was little, I went to Peter Piper Pizza
more.

1473
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:45,570
Did any of you guys know or anyone in chat either know Peter
Piper Pizza?

1474
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:47,110
It had a dinosaur instead.

1475
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,070
He would have loved it.

1476
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,470
Uncle.

1477
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:49,830
He would have loved it.

1478
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,610
He was a dinosaur instead of a mouse.

1479
01:22:56,210 --> 01:23:00,510
So if you pay enough at the Chucky Cheese wedding, can you
get Chucky Cheese to object?

1480
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,710
I mean, I bet if you ask him to.

1481
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:06,370
He might, yeah.

1482
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,130
Yeah.

1483
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:07,830

Go Phoebe's and do it.

1540
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:36,760
I wanted to do that all in an Italian accent.

1541
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,780
but I kind of couldn't.

1542
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,000
Yeah, I'll try.

1543
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,240

1545
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:44,580
You'll try.

1546
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,480
You can do it.

1547
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,020
I can do it.

1548
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:47,580
I'll try.

1549
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:48,420
Here we go.

1550

1554
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,240
sounded more like a Dracula.

1555
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,220
It sounded more like a Dracula.

1556
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:27,820
It's Dracula.

1557
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,100
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1558
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:33,660
Blah.

1559
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:34,120
Blah, blah, blah.

1560
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:39,720
Four spoons.

1561
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:47,390

1562
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:49,830
Blah.

01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:52,470
Blah.

1564
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:56,530
Is that the fourth accent unlocked?

1565
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:57,750
The Dracula accent.

1566
01:28:58,170 --> 01:28:59,250
I don't think so.

1567
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,950
Okay, I'm gonna try to try a different one.

1568
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:07,370
I'm gonna try a different one.

1569
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,150
I want to...

1570
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:13,990

01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:16,830

Yes.

1651
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,230
First, animals, now languages.

1652
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:35,030
Very educational.

1653
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:36,710

Let's do it.

1658
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:45,090
That was basically clear, obscure, though.

1659
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,490
That was Expedition 33, right?

1660
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:48,950

Taito?

1796
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:45,960
Friendship ended with Miku.

01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:04,200
Yay!

1802
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,080
That's what I know, right?

1803
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,240
I lost chance to prove ourselves.

1804
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,860
Okay, yeah, this is the finals.

1805
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:14,580
The finals.

1806
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:17,440
Final countdown.

1807
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:21,740
Oh no.

1808
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,100
What do you mean it gets cursed at the end?

1809
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,860
I think the whole thing is cursed probably.

1810
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,480
I think the whole thing is cursed.

1811
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:33,020
Let's have the most glorious end off, shall we?

1812
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:34,540
Okay.

1813
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,060
I won't do this though.

1814
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:38,940
I'll be solo though.

1815
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:42,800
Let's go.

1816
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:44,720
I think it's a pretty safe bet.

1817
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:51,510
We know what's going to be in hair maybe yes there's quite a
bit of brain rot out there now let's see

You can do it individually.

Actually, nothing to do with the planning of today's stream.

01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,770
That was all us.

1916
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,090
But you know, it's still his fault.

1917
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:37,170
He'll take the criticism and he'll screen it and tell us
none of it.

1918
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:40,190
No!
