00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,270
Hello!

2
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
I've been doing this, this.

3
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,500
I've been doing that.

4
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,880
So, yeah.

5
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,120
I wanna say something.

6
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,640
Before I start, because I already saw people...

7
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,360
I already had to time someone out.

8
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay.

9
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,390
I'm sorry that I'm kind of late to the...

10
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,510
To the party.

11
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,610
To the party!

12
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,790
Party, party, party.

13
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,490
But...

14
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,570
People... I don't... I will not tolerate...

15
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,360
People coming in and being like...

16
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,270
Hey, do this thing.

17
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,350
Hey.

18
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,570
Do this thing.

19
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,450
It will...

20
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,450
It will...

21
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,690
Do this.

22
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,410
Do this.

23
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,110
Do this Vtuber.

24
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,950
Do this Vtuber!

25
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,890
No, nobody spoiled.

26
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,790
And obviously no spoilers.

27
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,230
But it's backseating.

28
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,350
No backseating, please, today.

29
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,990
No backseating.

30
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,810
I already saw someone in the chat who was just like...

31
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,750
Click on your face.

32
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,310
No!

33
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,390
I already was doing that!

34
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,590
You don't need to tell me!

35
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,510
Sorry.

36
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,910
I saw it and I was like...

37
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,710
No...

38
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,110
Can't wait till you spoiler, spoiler, then spoiler with spoiler, no spoiler.

39
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,030
There's a town in Ontario, Canada called Minto.

40
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:13,830
Really?

41
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:15,850
Hey.

42
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:17,690
Oh.

43
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,410
Really?

44
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,310
It's really cold where I am, so I hope everyone is keeping warm.

45
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,310
It's so cold.

46
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,710
It's so cold.

47
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,870
My ectoplasm is freezing.

48
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,290
Last night, I sleep with a heater, right?

49
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,590
Like on my bed.

50
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,870
And I usually, in the winter, only have to put like the settings not super duper high.

51
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,370
But last night, I put it on three.

52
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,010
And it was too warm.

53
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,030
That's exactly how I thought it would be.

54
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,430
Especially when you have two cats on top of you.

55
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,870
But I was like, so cold yesterday.

56
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,510
I was just like, I'm gonna put it on three.

57
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,910
Three out of what?

58
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,710
I

59
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,710
don't know, because I never put it up more.

60
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,170
I think it's out of like six.

61
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,470
I think it's out of like six.

62
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,510
It's like the strength, you know?

63
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,030
And there it goes, thanks for the 20 gift.

64
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,390
Yay!

65
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,670
Hey VTuber, I haven't seen more of five minutes of this game.

66
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,110
Can you click the exit button?

67
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,690
Actually, that's funny you mentioned that.

68
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,370
Because if you press the exit button, look at her face.

69
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,750
She gets really upset.

70
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,550
She's like...

71
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,470
You don't wanna do that.

72
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,070
This is my face...

73
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,110
When you tell me what to do.

74
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,490
Now she's happy again.

75
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,470
She's like, anyway.

76
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,730
Wasn't that so silly that we tried to do that?

77
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,150
Clicks on Minto's face.

78
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:03,390
Stop!

79
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,550
I'm attending the wedding of my best friend soon and thinking about getting a new perfume for it.

80
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,750
So far, I've narrowed it down to three.

81
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,810
Which scent would Mei Domingo prefer?

82
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,330
Hay?

83
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,790
Wood?

84
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,710
Jablomi?

85
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,320
I don't... what the...

86
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,920
What the... what scent...

87
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,100
I don't think I would go for a hay one.

88
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,360
It smells like grass.

89
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,620
Don't say it!

90
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,480
Oh no.

91
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,860
What did I say?

92
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Oh, there's a motion sickness in this?

93
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,660
Thank you.

94
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,680
Actually, I... where would it be?

95
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,060
The game settings?

96
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,040
Wait, player voice?

97
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,720
I hear someone talking.

98
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,350
What was it?

99
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,470
Disable sway and try FOV around somebody.

100
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,210
Thank you!

101
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,270
Sway while walking?

102
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,150
Yeah, we don't want that.

103
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,730
Sensor gore?

104
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,050
I feel like I'm getting spoiled already.

105
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,070
Also, when I...

106
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,590
When it was loading, it said there's jump scares.

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,630
Is this game scary?

108
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,610
I'm scared.

109
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,010
Is this game scary?

110
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,450
What's the FOV?

111
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,150
No?

112
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,430
I feel like it can't be that scary if Matara was still able to...

113
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,290
Matara really recommended this.

114
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,550
I don't see the FOV.

115
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,750
Why do I feel like Minecraft?

116
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,580
It's not scary at all.

117
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,960
Never trust Mata?

118
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,320
Usually I wouldn't, but she wouldn't be able to play a game like this.

119
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
Or rather, she wouldn't be able...

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,240
She does not do horror games, you know.

121
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
ViviCore, thanks for the gift!

122
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,100
Subtitles on?

123
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,260
Are they not on automatically?

124
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,400
Okay.

125
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,020
Wait, what do I...

126
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
What is the difference?

127
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,400
None?

128
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,480
Just do one?

129
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,020
That's the screaming while...

130
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,280
We're getting gored to death?

131
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,660
Okay.

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,420
Sure.

133
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,480
Let's just try it, I suppose.

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,640
Also, this was kind of funny.

135
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,280
I was looking at the outfits and I was like...

136
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,620
Oh, we don't have these.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This one seems cute.

138
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,240
Oh, this one...

139
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,020
I can't quite tell what it is, but then the animation...

140
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,320
That's why they call me Revolver.

141
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,220
Wait, can we?

142
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,540
Oh my god, white?

143
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,260
White.

144
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,600
White.

145
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,240
What's her name?

146
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,200
I guess we'll learn it.

147
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Revolver, me aside, girl.

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,820
Yippee!

149
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,300
Let's start!

150
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,960
Day one.

151
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,400
Elvis.

152
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,620
Elvis.

153
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,440
Let's go, let's go.

154
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,720
Oh baby.

155
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,120
I has to.

156
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:06,860
Presents.

157
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,140
I got a message.

158
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,880
Tutorial, would you like me to teach you the ropes?

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,820
Yes, please!

160
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,100
Look around.

161
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,040
Okay, I'm looking.

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,960
That's me.

163
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,660
Oh gosh, I'm so generic.

164
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
And I'm messy too.

165
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, I'm the worst.

166
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,120
Okay, I'm moving.

167
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,600
Wow.

168
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
Elvis Presley.

169
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,260
Feet reveal.

170
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,120
It's already horror, you guys.

171
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,120
It's already scary.

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,020
Oh, that's me!

173
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm generic protagonist number 255.

174
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,780
So plain.

175
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,560
Oh, interact.

176
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,460
What are you doing here on the bed?

177
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,900
Why are you talking to your clothes?

178
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,480
What?

179
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,060
Well, can't say I got much use out of it.

180
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,160
I solved it once and never touched it again.

181
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,420
Guess I figured I wouldn't be able to do it a second time.

182
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,580
Our meds.

183
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,760
Look, we have so many meds.

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,700
You don't talk to your clothes, Minto?

185
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,580
Do you do?

186
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,440
You won!

187
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,620
What's this?

188
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,920
Let's do everything before we get our phone.

189
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,000
Can I just click it?

190
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,640
Okay, cool.

191
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,100
She was the best.

192
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,540
A cat lounging on a watermelon.

193
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,780
She is the best.

194
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,480
Your mom.

195
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,140
Logan, thanks for the five gifted.

196
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,000
What's this?

197
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,940
Another telephone.

198
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,660
Self-motivation.

199
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,940
What the hell is this schedule?

200
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,560
For some reason it does that every time I look.

201
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,720
We don't look alike at all, my sister and I.

202
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,780
Oh, that's your sister.

203
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,620
I was going to say hi, mama.

204
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,980
Everybody take your meds.

205
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,960
Oh, gosh, it's... it disappears.

206
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,220
Okay, I'm going to have to... I feel that this is more of a...

207
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,140
I look at game rather than look at chat type of game if I... if things...

208
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, I can't crouch or anything.

209
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,600
If things disappear before I can read them if I'm looking at chat.

210
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,040
Office life really drilled its etiquette into us, didn't it?

211
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,040
I still feel weirdly tied, but...

212
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,260
Will I ever see them again?

213
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,740
Wait, why did I even put this picture up?

214
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,260
Why would you... you put up a... yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

215
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,760
You put up a photo of your office mates?

216
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,120
That's weird.

217
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,140
Why would you do that?

218
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,840
Why would you do that?

219
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,620
Yeah.

220
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,280
Oh, so we're like... I thought we were going to be... I thought this was a school uniform.

221
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,420
But no, we are of the working world.

222
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,720
We're office workers.

223
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,640
We are contributing to society.

224
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:25,980
What's that?

225
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,240
Science.

226
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,500
Oh, my God.

227
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,560
No, it's that little pointing meme.

228
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,340
What the hell is this thing?

229
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,800
Is that supposed to be science?

230
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,340
Get built to soar.

231
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,340
We just murdered an entire town.

232
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,720
Is that my closet?

233
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,240
Nothing.

234
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,500
Okay, takes up a lot of space, buddy.

235
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,920
It's August.

236
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,460
Okay, we really like planes and trains.

237
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,740
A PS2?

238
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,380
Where?

239
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,360
Oh, yeah.

240
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,240
There really is a PS2.

241
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,180
Wait, is it?

242
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,740
Maybe.

243
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,740
Wait, we have games too.

244
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,520
You got games in your room?

245
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,340
I wish I could crouch.

246
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,060
Looks more like a PS4.

247
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,340
That's why I thought... Or rather, I was like, yeah, there's a PS2.

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,280
And then I was like, wait a second.

249
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Does her crouch?

250
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,240
My computer.

251
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,180
Let's see.

252
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:45,400
Set up a list of tasks, script character reactions, and maybe squeeze in some coding.

253
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
Oh, we're gaming, eh?

254
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,720
We're a game developer.

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,400
How meta.

256
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,300
Okay, checking my phone.

257
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
One new message.

258
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,260
Friend, MK, check this new version.

259
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,960
My friend has been hacked.

260
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,780
I'm downloading spyware.

261
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,140
Ransomware right now.

262
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,480
What is this?

263
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,920
Oh my gosh.

264
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,940
I forgot to mention, but when I first started the game and like...

265
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,420
So when you first open up the game, there's like this little animation before it takes you to the title screen.

266
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:33,700
And the main girl looks at you and does this cute little wink and opens her hands up and everything.

267
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,460
Oh my god, I had this overwhelming rush of like...

268
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,860
It was such a feeling of wanting to play one of those dating sim type of games, like Love Plus or something.

269
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,180
I was just like, oh my gosh, I need to have a virtual girlfriend right now.

270
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:03,180
It's exactly the feeling that overcame me, like in such a feral, like animalistic need.

271
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,320
I was like, I need to have a virtual girlfriend.

272
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,760
I was like, oh my gosh, I'm about to bust out my 3DS.

273
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm about to put in Love Plus.

274
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm about to...

275
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,420
Oh, I was so...

276
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,420
I was just like, I miss this so much.

277
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:22,720
What?

278
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,740
I wanted... Oh my gosh, it was so weird to describe.

279
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,120
She's down bad.

280
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,360
I don't know, I think it was just the fact that the character, like she looked at me and...

281
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,440
I don't know.

282
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,660
I was like, it felt like she was looking into my soul.

283
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,660
I'm only soul.

284
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,360
I am!

285
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,360
She's in love.

286
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,720
Maybe.

287
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,040
I want to play, I want to play Den 9 Simulation.

288
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,200
I love straight up dating sims.

289
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,700
This is what drives the otaku heart.

290
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,280
It's true!

291
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,760
Oh no, this is not... I'm so cooked.

292
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,100
My name, I'm Minto.

293
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
Let's do it.

294
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,020
How did it know that?

295
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,380
Wait a second.

296
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,580
How did it know that?

297
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,380
I'm putting in Minto.

298
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,580
Oh, Steam Live.

299
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,340
Nice to meet you, Minto.

300
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,080
Um, Minto?

301
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,980
Sayu is really cute.

302
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
She's so cute.

303
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,040
I sort of rushed off earlier and now this place is a mess.

304
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,920
Could you help me tidy up a bit?

305
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,110
Oh, wait.

306
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,450
How do I move?

307
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,870
How do I move?

308
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,370
Oh, whoa.

309
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,710
Oh, Dwight, where's the panties?

310
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,250
Oh, she's a boxer briefs kind of gal.

311
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,170
I got it.

312
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,430
I respect it.

313
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,170
Wait, how do I... Oh, Dwight, pick one up.

314
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,850
Okay, there we go.

315
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,210
This game kind of sucks.

316
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,660
Whoa!

317
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,580
Naoto Yamabie.

318
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,580
It said a different name though, earlier.

319
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,000
It was funny because it kind of looked... it kind of was like Kana Hanazawa, unless it's a stage name.

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,880
It was like Hana Wa Kana or something.

321
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,440
It says it in the title screen.

322
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,480
I love Hana Kana.

323
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,540
Yeah, but it's not her.

324
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,690
Yeah, nice to meet you.

325
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,690
Kana Hanaiwa.

326
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,530
I was just like, oh, it's almost like Hanazawa Kana.

328
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,250
But she sounds...

329
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,010
But she sounds so cute.

330
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,930
Oh, we're doing the app again.

331
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,610
Uh-oh.

332
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,510
Maybe we should clean.

333
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,210
No?

334
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,250
Alright, that's fine.

335
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,900
Oh, she's hungry.

336
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,260
Minto, my stomach's growling.

337
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,400
I'm so hungry.

338
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,580
Do you think you can help me with the ingredients for some chicken soup?

339
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,860
Okay, let's go kill a chicken.

340
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,540
Press here.

341
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,580
Food.

342
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,060
Soup.

343
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,820
That's it?

344
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,320
Oh, you bought chicken soup ingredients.

345
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,860
Nevermind.

346
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,740
I thought we were going to get a little more rustic with it.

347
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,740
Yay, you got everything.

348
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,880
How about we cook it together?

349
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,400
Is it a... is it a... what's it called?

350
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,340
A rhythm game?

351
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,100
Chop the veggies?

352
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,900
Oh.

353
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
Dang, I'm good.

354
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,780
Dang, I'm good.

355
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,360
Dang, I'm good.

356
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,590
Cooking mama.

357
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,630
Dang, I'm good.

358
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,890
Look at these perfectly...

359
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,550
I'm thinking of buying a portable TV today.

360
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:55,750
A

361
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,260
small one with an antenna.

362
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,440
Perfect for walks, don't you think?

363
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,060
Minto, I think you should disconnect a little bit when you do a walk, you know?

364
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,200
Maybe listen to a podcast instead.

365
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,700
You don't want to be walking around.

366
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,560
That's basically like walking around, like, on your phone.

367
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,480
Girl needs an iPad.

368
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,860
She's an iPad kid!

369
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,100
Oh no!

370
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,470
You can play games to earn money.

371
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,490
Oh, did you know you can play games to earn money?

372
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,470
Yeah, you just told me.

373
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,290
Play mini games to earn money.

374
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,010
$4.50.

375
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:45,870
Okay.

376
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,810
This is her, what, entertainment?

377
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,590
And this is her food, I guess?

378
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,130
Uh, mini game.

379
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:54,690
Oh.

380
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,250
Money for TV.

381
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,170
Minecraft!

382
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,380
Oh, I only have 20 energy!

383
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:09,640
No!

384
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,540
Aw, man.

385
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,540
No!

386
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,420
Is this Metal Gear?

387
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,360
Oh, maybe Metal Gear for babies.

388
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,560
The blue goes into the...

389
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,550
Blue cube goes into...

390
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,550
Red circle goes into...

391
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,390
Or red sphere, rather.

392
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,550
And then, the green triangle...

393
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,550
Yeah!

394
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,630
We got money!

395
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,090
How much money do we need?

396
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,250
Oh, I think I... Okay, we still have 6.

397
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,350
What is this?

398
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,830
Is this like you blow on the game cartridge to make it work simulator?

399
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,930
Yeah, we're learning with Minto.

400
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,410
Which one should we do?

401
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,450
This one or this one?

402
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,930
Wait, pretty much?

403
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,590
Is it actually?

404
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,690
Really?

405
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,070
The first one?

406
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,110
The cartridge?

407
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,510
Okay.

408
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,310
What the hell?

409
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,960
Why is this... Why was the first one literally for babies and then this one is...

410
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,040
So much more advanced.

411
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,600
Okay.

412
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,680
Easy.

413
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,960
Okay.

414
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,760
You did it.

415
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,000
You have enough to buy me that portable TV.

416
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,740
Yeah.

417
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,640
Okay, we're gonna buy you the TV.

418
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,940
Under furniture?

419
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:14,800
Oh.

420
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,120
Okay.

421
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,220
What if I bought you an upgrade?

422
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,800
A toy?

423
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,220
Anything else?

424
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,560
No?

425
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:22,960
Okay.

426
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,960
There's no free will in this game.

427
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,200
I don't think that's very portable.

428
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,880
Do you guys think so?

429
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,580
That's the one.

430
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,180
Small, portable and cheap.

431
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,580
Just what I wanted.

432
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:43,700
Ten?

433
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,080
Yeah, I'm back.

434
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,140
I'm back.

435
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,640
I think we're cooked, you guys.

436
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,820
Have I eaten?

437
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm gonna look around my room and there will be cup noodles, containers everywhere.

438
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,000
I lost my hairbrush.

439
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,820
Could you help me find it?

440
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,140
Try checking the bedside table first.

441
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,980
Why don't you do that then?

442
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,480
If you think you left it there.

443
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,680
Empty.

444
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,310
No brush there.

445
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,690
Oh my gosh, you know what games are the worst though?

446
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,530
The ones that like...

447
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,390
Those like... I used to play the My Little Pony game.

448
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,570
I don't even remember what it was called.

449
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:45,130
And then you would try to build your equestria place and you would be building a building and it's the ones that are in like real time.

450
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,010
Like...

451
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,250
You would like build a building and it would be like...

452
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,350
Oh, this is going to take 10 hours real time and you're just like...

453
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,690
No, I have to get enough money for Princess Celestia.

454
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,030
It's so evil.

455
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,230
Those ones are...

456
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,750
Those kinds of games are the most evil and then they're just like...

457
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:17,090
Oh, but if you pay us 10 gemmies, you can finish it in half the time.

458
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:17,750
And you're like...

459
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,470
I have to finish it in half the time.

460
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,870
My grandpa used to watch wrestling on a small TV like that until he got mad and threw it out his shed window.

461
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,730
So it's portable enough to be eatable.

462
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,170
Wow.

463
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,130
Just like the old Facebook games, you know?

464
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,390
I never played a single one of those.

465
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,030
Kind of impressive, right?

466
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,630
Well, everybody played Farmville and all of those.

467
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,450
That's the only one I know actually.

468
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,650
I never played a single one.

469
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
I just wasn't interested.

470
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,660
I don't know.

471
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,220
Mafia Facebook was crazy.

472
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,440
Wait!

473
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,760
Maybe there was one that I played.

474
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,700
Oh no, it wasn't a game.

475
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,620
Do you remember how on Facebook you used to be able to poke people?

476
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,680
I would have poking wars with friends.

477
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,890
I would just constantly be poking people.

478
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,310
And we would never miss.

479
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,830
Okay, no hairbrush.

480
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,750
What about somewhere else?

481
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,150
Just don't look in the oven.

482
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,030
I already checked there, girl.

483
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,270
You're making me want to check the oven.

484
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,970
Oh, misclick.

485
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,930
Sorry, I fat-fingered it.

486
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,590
I need a new phone.

487
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,510
Oh, I have those.

488
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,430
I'm not thinking of upgrading my phone, but...

489
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:05,810
But...

490
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,930
I have this horrible scratch on the front of my screen.

491
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,150
And so every time I see it, it makes me want to upgrade.

492
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,830
You know what I mean?

493
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,310
And then I got an email yesterday that was just like...

494
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:24,530
If you get the new Samsung S25, you can get it for a lot cheaper.

495
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,310
It was like 70% off or something.

496
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,430
And I'm just like...

497
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,770
No, don't tempt me.

498
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,430
I had a Facebook poke war that lasted a couple of years.

499
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,090
Woah.

500
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,790
They're listening, they know.

501
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,470
I know.

502
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,510
I had to pay 140 to fix my screen.

503
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,610
I see it every time.

504
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,910
No screen protector?

505
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,890
Okay, when I...

506
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,050
So, correct me if I'm wrong, but iPhones come with a screen protector on them.

507
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,590
Correct?

508
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,890
Like, already on the screen.

509
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,410
Right?

510
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,310
No.

511
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,010
Not anymore.

512
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,890
Well, I guess mine did because it was older.

513
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,250
I think mine did because it was older.

514
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,430
But anyway, I assumed that...

515
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,210
I'm a genius, I found it.

516
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,870
First try?

517
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,790
I'm speedrunning the game.

518
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,970
But I assumed my phone had one because I'm just a dummy dumb.

519
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,030
And then one day I was just like, woah.

520
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,910
I was playing Blue Archive and I was looking...

521
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,170
I noticed this horrible scratch across the face.

522
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,770
And I was like, no!

523
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,150
So, what should we do next?

524
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,510
Oh, day 20.

525
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,590
What's she doing?

526
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,270
I mean, that would be such a big help, honestly.

527
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,680
That TV, it was so cool and all, but it broke already.

528
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,380
Anyway, could you help me move this wardrobe?

529
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,700
Totally related.

530
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,450
It's super heavy.

531
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,610
I keep hearing, I keep wanting to hear...

532
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,970
What's her name?

533
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,070
Voice of Amelia.

534
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,610
Her going like...

535
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,010
Yay!

536
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,130
Rie Takahashi, thank you.

537
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,910
For some reason her name would not come to me.

538
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,990
Welcome to membership!

539
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,810
Thank you so much.

540
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:14,960
Sweaty.

541
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,840
She called me sweaty!

542
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,200
Day 33.

543
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,360
Oh, Mito.

544
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,180
It's only been a day, but I've missed you so much.

545
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,680
I wish you could visit me more often.

546
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,560
I have a present for you, Mito.

547
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,820
I bought it with my hard-earned money.

548
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,700
Yes.

549
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,160
Oh, she's so sweet!

550
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,480
I want to know what I got her, though.

551
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,300
I mean, I've been thinking.

552
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,940
I wish we could meet in person.

553
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,640
It's so frustrating that I can't.

554
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,820
Hey, hey, hey!

555
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,240
You didn't translate some of these parts!

556
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,900
You're always helping me, being so kind every day.

557
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,200
I wish I could do something for you, too.

558
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,380
Weird translation, yeah?

559
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,300
Maybe the translation is more towards the Russian?

560
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,060
Rather than the Japanese?

561
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,540
Oh, I've got an idea!

562
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,960
Oh my god.

563
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,320
What's that?

564
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,120
She's like, just come to me in the virtual world instead.

565
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,740
What?

566
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,960
I miss Mito already.

567
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,020
I'm not ready either!

568
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,480
Now we're together.

569
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,260
Put the phone down.

570
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm so ready for anything that happens.

571
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,880
I am bracing my body for anything that happens!

572
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,800
I am ready.

573
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,960
Hello?

574
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,060
Wait, who wrote that?

575
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,740
Where am I?

576
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,120
This place looks familiar.

577
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,340
Wait, I'm in the game?

578
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,780
Oh my god, it's the oven!

579
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,140
It's the famous oven!

580
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,200
Wow.

581
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
I love you.

582
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,140
Oh my gosh, this fridge is mint!

583
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,800
How can I get one?

584
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,840
She also has gravure on her walls?

585
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,380
She's just like, me for real for real.

586
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,860
Jamassacre.

587
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,160
No, it's jam massacre.

588
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,220
It's a massacre of sandwiches.

589
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,140
You know, that's not blood, that's just like strawberry jam.

590
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,560
Cream yourself?

591
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,250
I think Mito is...

592
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,850
A little down bad.

593
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,010
I think Mito...

594
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,410
I think Mito has been...

595
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,030
Struggling.

596
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,750
She loves cooking, my goodness.

597
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,050
I think she's been a little, you know...

598
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,770
Oh my gosh, that's ours though.

599
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,230
What is this?

600
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,030
Hello.

601
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,270
Is this Mito as like...

602
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,970
A kid?

603
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,430
Oh, she's so cute!

604
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,010
I love the short hair.

605
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,390
No, it's a trap!

606
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,890
Sorry, it's hard for me.

607
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,570
I think I have a pinched nerve.

608
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,610
And it's hard for me to look to the left.

609
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,410
Farm?

610
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,130
Farm?

611
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,990
Farm...

612
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,210
Farm...

613
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,190
What?

614
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,230
Clever book.

615
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,590
How to tease him.

616
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,410
Microwave to the future.

617
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,470
Wait, what's this one?

618
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,790
That's my kind of book, Mito, please.

619
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,650
Error drama.

620
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,990
Before it's too... Run before it's too late.

621
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,570
My idea blooms.

622
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,310
Are these...

623
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,570
What to do with all those bitches?

624
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:56,450
Books?

625
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,970
Start by turning it on.

626
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,110
Oh my gosh, she's so cute!

627
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,600
Her room.

628
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,300
Mito's bed.

629
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,720
Mito's bed!

630
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,280
Wait, this is her though, right?

631
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,220
That's so cute.

632
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,780
Wow.

633
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,360
What does it say?

634
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,420
Eye of infinity?

635
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,760
Control yourself.

636
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,880
How can I?

637
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:37,560
You would do the same if you were transported into your virtual girlfriend's room!

638
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,580
Why did this never...

639
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,540
Why... I know I'm anime and all, but why couldn't this be me?

640
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,120
Turning what on?

641
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,120
Outdated version.

642
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,480
Put objects on scanner.

643
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,160
Find the required objects and place them on the scanner.

644
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,840
How do I know?

645
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,180
Oh, spoon, pencil, bow knot.

646
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,840
Oh my god, we're gonna generate her right here.

647
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,700
Oh my god, build a girlfriend!

648
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,360
Can I turn the light?

649
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,840
A spoon.

650
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,740
A spoon full of sugar helps make our girlfriend.

651
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,760
She'll be so sweet and cute.

652
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,440
What was this?

653
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,120
Spoon?

654
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,520
Spoon, what else?

655
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,500
Turn the game console off right now.

656
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,040
Spoon.

657
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,270
Oh, pencil.

658
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,070
That's what it was.

659
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,190
Pencil, pencil, pencil.

660
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,290
Just like the Powerpuff Girls.

661
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,270
Does that mean we'll make three of them?

662
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,290
Because... even better.

663
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,130
Not these ones, they suck.

664
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,710
Love knot.

665
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,350
What's this one?

666
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,450
Who is Miss Meta Universe here?

667
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:15,810
What?

668
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,770
What is that?

669
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,910
Oh, wait, how am I...

670
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,620
Can I play her video games?

671
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,280
What kind of games would she play?

672
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,340
There's a photo mode that lets you free cam.

673
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,760
Oh, okay, we'll try it eventually.

674
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,760
No, we just got into the game.

675
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,460
I've seen like five pencils.

676
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,260
And then also a bow knot.

677
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,820
Can't open that.

678
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,780
I feel like the bow knot would be in here, right?

679
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,820
Oh, this pencil.

680
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,540
Oh, it's the specialist pencil.

681
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,400
My bad.

682
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,900
Okay.

683
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,180
And then...

684
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,860
It looks like a scrunchie, kind of.

685
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,860
Bow knot.

686
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,660
Never heard it called that before.

687
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,540
Seems like a direct translation kind of dealio.

688
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,340
I feel like I've looked around though.

689
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,460
Am I dumb?

690
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,780
I don't know what this thing looks like.

691
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,140
That's interesting art.

692
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,400
It's got some...

693
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,920
Check the other room.

694
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,440
There's more?

695
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,540
Wait, could I not go outside?

696
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,080
No, I can't look.

697
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,460
Is there more rooms that I haven't noticed?

698
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,640
Oh my god!

699
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,260
There's a whole other room!

700
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,340
I need to shower.

701
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,820
Or toothbrush.

702
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,120
I found it.

703
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,900
Oh, there it is.

704
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,200
Okay.

705
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,180
Let's make a girlfriend!

706
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,680
Scan the objects and start the machine.

707
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,540
Ready to run.

708
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,000
Me?

709
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,440
Am I?

710
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,250
Oh boy.

711
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,730
I'm Frankenstein.

712
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,150
Liv!

713
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,410
She's alive!

714
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,870
She's alive!

715
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,550
Ready to run away.

716
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,610
My arms are open wide!

717
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,470
Portal activated.

718
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:11,990
What's this?

719
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,070
Portal activated.

720
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,190
Wait, rotate...

721
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:18,870
Finally.

722
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,590
Send message.

723
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:25,550
Secret.

724
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:31,770
Scoot!

725
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:33,310
Done!

726
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:34,330
This is done!

727
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,270
Get red secret.

728
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,210
Oh my gosh!

729
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,510
War cry!

730
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,090
Hi, Liz!

731
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,250
Thank you for the bread!

732
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,930
Hello, Rosarians.

733
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,550
We just built ourselves a girlfriend, I think.

734
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,990
This is my first time playing MISOID.

735
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,050
We just started, so howdy howdy.

736
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,250
Is there anything else I need to do?

737
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,490
We're going to fuse together.

738
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,250
Maybe we are fusing together.

739
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,130
It's super fun!

740
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,770
Oh gosh, get to the fuse box.

741
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:31,450
Hello.

742
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,630
Or did it?

743
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,370
I can't tell.

744
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,350
Thank you for the gift, thank you!

745
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,750
It's a little freaky.

746
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,810
Is my girl in here now?

747
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,270
Find and return the missing batteries to the machine.

748
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,450
Who are you?

749
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:54,750
Me?

750
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:57,250
I'm Minto.

751
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,130
Okay, let's go find some batteries.

752
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:03,770
Don't you see me?

753
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:04,770
Wanna play?

754
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,890
I sure hope I don't see you.

755
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,490
Not in the toilet.

756
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,610
What was that?

757
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,330
A creaking sound?

758
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:14,930
I don't think...

759
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,790
Not in the bathroom though, ma'am, please.

760
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,310
Can I grab that?

761
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,170
Take a battery.

762
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,950
Thank you.

763
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,250
It's okay, it's...

764
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,710
Oh!

765
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,510
If it's a hot girl, I don't mind so much.

766
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,310
I think.

767
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,210
Who are you?

768
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,890
I can't run in this game.

769
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,030
I guess that's a good thing.

770
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,990
There was someone in the window.

771
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:55,810
Freaky.

772
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:01,880
Freaky!

773
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,040
How did we get here?

774
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,120
Why are we here?

775
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,060
Jam Massacre.

776
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:18,980
Here.

777
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,520
What is that bumping?

778
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,480
There's flies.

779
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,060
Oh no!

780
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,800
It's okay if you're a little stinky girl.

781
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,560
It's fine, probably.

782
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:34,660
Probably.

783
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,160
It's okay.

784
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,920
I'll still...

785
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,340
We can change the stank.

786
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,180
We can change the smell, you know.

787
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,400
You gotta do a shower.

788
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,860
We definitely have that.

789
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,740
Okay, how many?

790
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Oh, four of them.

791
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,860
Oh gosh, okay.

792
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:56,780
Does this not work?

793
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,880
Where do I put the other ones?

794
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:01,780
Okay.

795
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,600
Maybe one in here?

796
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,200
It's glow-in-the-dark, obviously.

797
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,780
That would ruin it.

798
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,480
One more.

799
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,980
Is there a room I haven't checked?

800
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,460
Let's go check the stench.

801
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,010
Oh no!

802
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,330
Oh, it's inside the fridge.

803
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:33,950
Oh, stanky battery.

804
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,110
Okay.

805
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,590
You...

806
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,510
Are you...

807
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,650
Oh no, the love!

808
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,710
We lost the love!

809
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,610
I can fix it.

810
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,270
I can salvage this relationship.

811
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:59,850
L is for the way you look at me.

812
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,110
O is for...

813
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,930
The only one I see.

814
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:14,110
V is very, very...

815
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,270
Oh.

816
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,410
The light?

817
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:20,610
I can't tell if that was a graphical error or not.

818
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,350
Okay.

819
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:29,710
Oh, from far away it looked like she turned into a basketball.

820
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,050
Alright.

821
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,790
Where do you want me to put these in?

822
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,190
There?

823
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:38,810
There?

824
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,470
Got it.

825
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,510
Should be ballin'.

826
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,730
Should be ballin'.

827
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,150
There?

828
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,330
There's one.

829
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,850
Alright, and...

830
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,190
The last beepy.

831
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,290
Perfect.

832
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,150
Okay, start the machine.

833
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,850
Create a girlfriend, part 2.

834
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,590
Even if she...

835
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,130
Has the power.

836
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,410
Cuts the power.

837
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,250
Today is a good day.

838
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:30,990
Oh, oh.

839
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,980
That's it?

840
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,580
Jeez.

841
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,160
Oh my god.

842
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,360
See?

843
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,480
You are a genius.

844
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,900
To my side.

845
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,900
How did that happen?

846
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,500
Together at last.

847
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,740
It's okay.

848
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,980
Look how cute she is.

849
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,420
How did I get inside the game?

850
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,500
What if I want to go back?

851
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,160
Are you Mito?

852
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,300
And you must be Mito, right?

853
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,800
You were the creative girlfriend all along.

854
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,160
Can't believe Mito got jumpscared by a pretty girl.

855
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,440
I realize she talks kind of fast, so...

856
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,160
And I'm sorry, I know it's like in Japanese too.

857
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,760
I guess maybe it would be better than having no voice.

858
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,720
If I... Is it okay if I don't voice it?

859
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,740
I feel really bad though.

860
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,760
Because usually, especially if it's in another language, I want to...

861
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,180
I want to be able to click it, you know?

862
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:17,920
It's okay?

863
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,500
I feel like probably most of you guys have watched this from another Vtuber anyway.

864
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,480
So...

865
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,960
Just don't move the camera too much from text.

866
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:28,920
Got it.

867
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,340
Got it, got it.

868
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,660
So how did I get inside the game?

869
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,640
This place.

870
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,920
Oh, she's...

871
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,300
Not really.

872
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,820
So, she explained it to us.

873
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,100
I'm afraid to ask this one.

874
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
What if I want to go back?

875
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,000
No, no, I'm not saying that.

876
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,380
I'm just saying what if, you know?

877
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,840
Yeah, we're together.

879
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,660
What's on your computer?

880
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,780
You got games on this thing?

881
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,020
Does the computer work or is it just a desk decoration?

882
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,040
Oh, fancy.

883
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,340
I was going to say she's a poser.

884
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,940
It's because of your job.

885
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,190
Oh, gotta make a living, you know?

886
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,780
Though how do you know I sit at my computer a lot?

887
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,080
Oh!

888
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,280
That's not entirely proper, but whatever.

889
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,660
That's fine, I think.

890
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,740
She knows that.

891
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,200
I thought she was going to say you've hardly paid me, as in like you've hardly...

892
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,660
Because of my job.

893
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:15,620
I thought she was criticizing my job and saying that I wasn't getting paid a lot and therefore I couldn't give her a lot of money.

894
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,280
Are you cold?

895
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,020
Oh, now she's sleepy.

896
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,420
Oh my god, she's so cute.

897
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,880
Oh, Mita.

898
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,100
I think I'm cooked.

899
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,700
I think I...

900
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,420
What's this?

901
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:29,520
Yeah.

902
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,820
Yeah, why were they important, huh?

903
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,060
Oh...

904
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,700
Oh...

905
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
But why are they important?

906
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,420
What is this thing?

907
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,620
That's one creepy figurine.

908
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,740
Do you like such things?

909
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,160
Oh, it almost looks like it's cursed.

910
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,560
Maybe you're right.

911
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,120
She's like, it's definitely not cursed.

912
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,040
What's wrong with you?

913
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,060
She's perfect.

914
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,560
Why would you get here in your immediate...

915
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,200
Oh, the pictures are changed.

916
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,820
I think we were in the wrong version of the game.

917
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,900
Oh, that's us!

918
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,520
Oh my god!

919
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,440
She loves us for real.

920
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,520
We were actually in the wrong place.

921
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,600
Who was the other girl though?

922
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:30,980
Interesting.

923
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,220
She told you that.

924
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,520
Yeah, but like...

925
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,840
School uniform, why would you need that?

926
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,780
Do you actually go to school?

927
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,260
I feel that.

928
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,080
New clothes!

929
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,100
Oh yeah, Doomguy!

930
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,340
Oh my gosh, speaking of Doom, did you guys see that collector's set?

931
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,540
Of the new Doom game coming out.

932
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,540
It comes with a big giant figurine.

933
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,060
And it looks so good actually.

934
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,080
I was like...

935
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,080
I was...

936
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,420
I don't remember.

937
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,720
Yeah, Dark Ages.

938
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,200
If you look it up, like Dark Ages...

939
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,860
Like Doom Dark Ages collector's edition.

940
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,220
You'll probably see it.

941
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,680
It looks really really good.

942
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,900
What's in your bathroom, Mita?

943
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,520
It doesn't matter what world we go to.

944
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,020
You like to follow me even if I'm going to the toilet, Mita?

945
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:44,940
That's fine.

946
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,800
You might see something you're not ready to see though.

947
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,700
We just...Mita, I know we've been...

948
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,580
In the bathroom?

949
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,060
Girl, what the hell?

950
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,600
Girl, you know there's like poop germs all around in here.

951
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,740
It's so nasty.

952
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,520
Don't eat in the bathroom, please.

953
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,340
How come there's no reflection?

954
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:12,760
That's right.

955
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,480
I forgot to turn on the reflection.

956
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,720
Look, it's reflecting now.

957
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:24,200
Come to think of it, I didn't even know what reflection was before.

958
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,940
It didn't exist in this world until there was an update.

959
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,380
There are a lot of reflections in your world.

960
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,680
Mita doesn't poop.

961
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,900
Please apologize to her.

962
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,560
Mita, I'm so sorry.

963
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,940
I'm so sorry.

964
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,580
You're right.

965
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,180
You probably don't.

966
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,660
Siblings or dating?

967
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,900
Yeah, it's that...

968
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,080
It's that game.

969
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,600
If you saw us walking along on the street, would you say siblings or dating?

970
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,340
She got all the good looks though.

971
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,720
Okay.

972
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,280
Keep staring at her?

973
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,320
Hold on, I wanna see if she comes out.

974
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Oh, there she is.

975
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,960
Oh, that's what the little hair thingy was.

976
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,320
Okay.

977
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,680
I'm gonna stare at her.

978
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,080
Is she gonna become like red like Meryl?

979
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,200
Oh, sorry.

980
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,440
She said, what are you doing?

981
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,530
Look at her looking up at me.

982
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,850
Also, holy collar bones.

983
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,590
Come on, snake.

984
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,480
Okay.

985
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,420
She looks so sassy.

986
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,080
What else we got in here, Mita?

987
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,700
Let's play video games together.

988
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,160
There's my phone.

989
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,160
How many channels do you have?

990
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,240
Oh, that's even better.

991
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,000
So you can watch anything.

992
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,780
We were like, anything you say.

993
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,560
Oh, hold on.

994
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,060
What is that?

995
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,800
Cool juice.

996
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,760
I don't think this is...

997
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,780
This is not what my internet looks like.

998
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,760
What?

999
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:53,390
What?

1000
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,400
Witchcraft.

1001
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,800
I'm gonna drink the juice.

1002
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm gonna drink the tele juice.

1003
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,360
Itadakimasu.

1004
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,340
Dang, save her some.

1005
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:13,780
What?

1006
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,400
That's rude.

1007
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,240
Dead juice.

1008
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,120
Juice made from... Wait, made from the juice shown in the ad.

1009
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,740
Yeah, I can't tell what it tastes like.

1010
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,140
It's all very confusing.

1011
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,360
Such peculiar ads.

1012
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,240
Dead juice?

1013
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,440
Straight from the juice ad.

1014
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,740
I love the juice ad.

1015
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,260
Okay, hold on.

1016
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,340
We'll wait for the phone.

1017
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,180
I wanna explore just a little bit.

1018
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:46,920
Is this...

1019
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,480
Whatever was here is gone now.

1020
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,940
Also, this is a photo of her.

1021
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,080
I wanna know who the other short haired girl was.

1022
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,920
So mysterious.

1023
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,000
Do you wear glasses?

1024
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:13,190
Kawaii!

1025
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,610
Yeah!

1026
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,750
They look good on you!

1027
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:22,490
Kawaii!

1028
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,770
Does that trick also work on Vtubers?

1029
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:28,490
Not for me.

1030
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,150
I don't really distort that kind of stuff.

1031
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:34,710
Oh, she's got some gravy pics up there.

1032
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:38,090
Let's see.

1033
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,910
I've played a ton, but I've never seen it rain here.

1034
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,370
Why have an umbrella?

1035
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,830
The fuse box.

1036
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,890
Why is there an electrical panel here?

1037
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,190
And if we're in a game, what is it for?

1038
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,790
Yeah, that's what I said.

1039
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:12,650
Oh.

1040
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:23,450
For flavor.

1041
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:27,910
That was the longest way of her saying that.

1042
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,210
What did you say?

1043
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,570
What's under the couch?

1044
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,690
I love the way she looks up when I get close to her.

1045
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,570
Oh my god, she's so cute.

1046
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,150
Can we go outside?

1047
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,990
She's so perfect!

1048
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:47,870
She's sniffing you.

1049
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,130
I'm sniffing her!

1050
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:50,710
Hi, Kiwawa!

1051
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:53,850
Hello, hello!

1052
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,610
Kiara, have you played this game too?

1053
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,050
I've basically stayed away from everybody who played it, so...

1054
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,050
Oh, what is that?

1055
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,070
Oh, continue.

1056
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,050
Oh, no, no, no.

1057
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,330
Hold on, we're still exploring.

1058
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:06,370
We're still exploring.

1059
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,990
We're in a sniffing competition.

1060
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,540
Oh, Kiwawa with the cats!

1061
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,040
This is the same, though.

1062
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,400
Why get a second TV?

1063
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,120
And an old one at that.

1064
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,300
Ooh.

1065
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,860
She's watching all the classic anime.

1066
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,510
She's sipping on some juice.

1067
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:55,470
Literally as I was taking a drink too.

1068
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,010
Oh my gosh, Mito.

1069
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,870
I think we're made for each other.

1070
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,210
Alright, let's go check out my phone.

1071
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,270
I thought my phone would be something kind of important.

1072
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,370
Since that's how we always talk to each other.

1073
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,510
That's my phone!

1074
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,150
And it's no longer in my pocket.

1075
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,910
How on earth did it end up here?

1076
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:17,490
Oh.

1077
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:18,750
Yeah?

1078
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:20,910
What's that?

1079
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:22,910
A picture?

1080
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:24,990
I knew it!

1081
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,730
Let's take a photo!

1082
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:26,890
Smile!

1083
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,290
Smile, Watashi!

1084
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,050
Oh my god, I'm so miserable.

1085
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,970
I don't want to be the sad protagonist anymore!

1086
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:39,730
Siblings!

1087
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,490
No!

1088
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,090
If I run the game on it, will I see you there?

1089
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:47,770
Doesn't work that way, huh?

1090
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:48,650
Interesting.

1091
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,750
Okay, let's continue.

1092
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,730
Sad Weiji.

1093
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:52,950
No!

1094
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,150
Come on in here!

1095
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,840
The skirt is so sexy, I wish I could crouch.

1096
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,160
Continue.

1097
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:04,800
A ring?

1098
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,880
I like how the words fall.

1099
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:15,540
It's so cool.

1100
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,560
Oh yeah, the photo mode.

1101
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:18,580
Hold on.

1102
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,340
Photo mode.

1103
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,440
Photo mode.

1104
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:26,260
Wait, how do I...

1105
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,160
Oh, here we go.

1106
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,840
Wait, she's cooking me!

1107
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:31,560
Wow!

1108
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,180
This is kind of a scary angle, huh?

1109
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,000
Yeah, baby!

1110
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,000
How do I go down?

1111
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,820
How do I...

1112
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,520
Oh, just the tiniest...

1113
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,440
No, hold on.

1114
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,160
This is the sexiest angle.

1115
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,300
Oh, I just moved myself.

1116
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,880
She's clipping outside her skirt a little bit.

1117
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,920
Kind of looks like...

1118
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,520
Shimakaze a little bit.

1119
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,680
It's okay.

1120
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,000
I like this.

1121
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,420
I like this.

1122
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:19,960
Oh, continue.

1123
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,300
Oh!

1124
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,560
I'm the best!

1125
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,100
Where did the vegetables come from?

1126
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,780
They weren't here just now.

1127
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,440
Okay, I'm the best at chopping the carrots.

1128
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:37,780
Everybody knows this.

1129
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,820
Everybody knows.

1130
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,260
Speed, speed, speed, speed.

1131
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,820
Speed, speed, speed, speed, speed.

1132
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,560
Speed, speed.

1133
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,020
Why isn't this going as fast as I thought it would be?

1134
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:55,860
Go!

1135
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,100
They're in the bathroom.

1136
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:03,620
Okay.

1137
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,340
I'm grabbing those for you, my sweet.

1138
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,620
Speedrun chopping.

1139
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,980
Wow, her room is so cute.

1140
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,640
Anton.

1141
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:33,710
Anton.

1142
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,800
Let's just put that back where it came from.

1143
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,840
We're in a video game!

1144
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,980
Was that fish always there?

1145
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,260
How did I not notice it until I saw it in the mirror?

1146
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,320
Alright, we'll give her the scissors.

1147
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,760
Anton.

1148
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,540
Is she cheating on me?

1149
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,820
What's my name?

1150
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,940
Oh, I'm Minto.

1151
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:16,560
Duh.

1152
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,660
Put the scissors!

1153
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,460
Have a seat.

1154
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,520
What did you make me, my sweet?

1155
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,320
William Antoine.

1156
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,720
Take the sauce.

1157
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,090
Alright.

1158
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,530
What kind of sauce is this?

1159
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,590
Love sauce?

1160
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:53,750
Oh.

1161
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:55,490
Indeed.

1162
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,750
I'm handing you the scissors.

1163
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:59,950
We're not going to talk about the cartridges.

1164
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,910
This is our perfect relationship.

1165
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:02,770
We do not see.

1166
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:05,370
Everything...

1167
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,770
We just...

1168
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,850
At some point, I feel like she's going to be like...

1169
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:11,370
Oh, by the way, you saw those cartridges.

1170
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:15,690
Oh.

1171
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,490
This feels like a dream.

1172
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:24,450
No.

1173
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:25,950
No, I mean...

1174
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:26,770
No, that's not it.

1175
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,770
This place just feels...

1176
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,730
No, I thought I meant it in a good way.

1177
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:33,690
You seem so real.

1178
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:36,690
No!

1179
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,450
My guy is...

1180
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,750
Oh, my guy sucks.

1181
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,490
Fumbled hard.

1182
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,130
No, I meant...

1183
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,450
It's supposed to be like...

1184
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,330
This feels like a dream being with you.

1185
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,990
I just feel like...

1186
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,150
This is the best experience of my life.

1187
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,030
No, Riz!

1188
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,270
Why is he being so judgmental?

1189
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:59,710
Why use scissors when you could have used a knife?

1190
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,970
Like, why is he such a jerk?

1191
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,530
Why are the windows all just white light?

1192
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,030
Her render distance...

1193
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,390
Didn't strike me as that odd.

1194
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,170
Honestly, it looks classy.

1195
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:26,810
Avoid lag!

1196
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,950
Unsquished bugs.

1197
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,690
I see, I see.

1198
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:38,150
So, what we ran into was just a bug, everybody.

1199
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:40,770
Just a bug, Potato PC.

1200
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:42,950
When can I go home?

1201
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,150
No, let's say your home is cozy.

1202
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:48,090
Riz-less.

1203
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:49,750
I'm not Riz-less.

1204
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:54,750
Bon appetit!

1205
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:02,170
Bon appetit!

1206
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:02,890
Delicious love.

1207
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,370
Oh gosh, I think we...

1208
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:15,390
Oh, I don't know if we should stand up.

1209
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,070
Put the dishes in the sink.

1210
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:18,770
Whoa!

1211
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,410
Whoa, she drugged us!

1212
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,470
Whoa, oh no!

1213
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:25,890
This is what happens.

1214
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:30,110
Yeah, she has hard eyes.

1215
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:30,710
Oh!

1216
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:32,570
Ma'am!

1217
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:36,290
There you go.

1218
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:39,030
Mita?

1219
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,010
What's happening?

1220
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,050
Mita?

1221
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,310
Oh, my eyes.

1222
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,490
Mita.

1223
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:49,990
Whoa!

1224
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,860
What do you see and feel?

1225
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,820
My heart is racing.

1226
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,800
And my vision is blurring.

1227
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,240
Try to stand up.

1228
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,480
Mita, we are frozen.

1229
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:17,820
Oh.

1230
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,840
I control her.

1231
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,380
Can we go backwards too?

1232
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,540
No, we can't moonwalk.

1233
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,680
We can only go forwards.

1234
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,260
Whoa, Mita.

1235
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:30,780
It's like I open a video...

1236
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,820
and it's a little off...

1237
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,120
and I click into the middle of the video.

1238
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,340
What are these?

1239
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,580
Look at my face.

1240
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:47,860
Go to the mirror.

1241
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,400
Oh, Mita, I haven't blinked in days.

1242
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,860
Oh, there.

1243
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,760
I just did it.

1244
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,120
Bon appétit!

1245
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,880
I took my meds.

1246
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,280
How are you feeling?

1247
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,600
Yeah, I'm feeling better.

1248
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,580
That worked fast.

1249
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,220
We are in a game.

1250
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,040
Everything here is very simple.

1251
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,900
Just a little effort...

1252
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,660
and you can get great results.

1253
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,440
That's the rule of the game.

1254
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:20,560
Wow.

1255
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,640
Simplification.

1256
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,000
An example, please?

1257
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,520
Carrots.

1258
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,600
Just one cut...

1259
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,060
and you get three.

1260
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,220
Oh.

1261
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,640
Look, this is all very sudden.

1262
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,920
I'm scared more than a little.

1263
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,660
Oh, she's gone.

1264
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,600
Mita?

1265
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,000
Find Mita.

1266
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,840
Things get weird.

1267
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,340
Mita, my beloved.

1268
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,360
Where have you gone?

1269
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,940
Wait, her room is gone.

1270
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,340
Her room is missing.

1271
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,160
Is she in here?

1272
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:08,540
Wait.

1273
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,460
Oh, there's another door.

1274
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:11,020
Interesting.

1275
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,620
Okay, we found her, but what's in here?

1276
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,960
Why did her room...

1277
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,460
What is that?

1278
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,340
Love coin.

1279
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,160
The machine is gone.

1280
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,000
Interesting.

1281
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,400
We are in a game.

1282
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,300
And they did an update on the game.

1283
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,220
They moved some stuff around.

1284
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,540
Oh, good.

1285
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,740
She kept the books.

1286
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:49,740
Yeah.

1287
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,480
How did you get here?

1288
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,560
You were right next to me just now.

1289
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,020
Why have the rooms changed?

1290
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,620
Oh, she rearranged.

1291
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,300
Aww.

1292
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,560
It got patched, yeah.

1293
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,060
You didn't have to.

1294
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,760
I was getting used to the layout.

1295
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,840
Ender, welcome to membership.

1296
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:29,640
Thank you.

1297
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,220
She's so caring.

1298
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,660
What do we do now?

1299
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:40,960
I thought you were making something.

1300
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,600
You're just standing there for fun?

1301
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,660
You just wanted to stare at the stove?

1302
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,360
That's fine.

1303
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,400
What the?

1304
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,080
Oh, okay.

1305
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,580
Oh, thank you.

1306
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,120
This is so weird.

1307
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,380
Are we inside someone's phone?

1308
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:06,180
Maybe a slow one with long loading times?

1309
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:07,320
It'll be surreal.

1310
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:11,980
Hmm.

1311
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,920
We're being loaded.

1312
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,260
Oh, her tongue!

1313
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,020
Oh.

1314
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,620
What?

1315
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,520
Yeah, let's play a game!

1316
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:28,700
What cards?

1317
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,440
Game, game.

1318
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,720
Play a game with Mita.

1319
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,480
Awesome.

1320
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:38,960
I was wondering because wasn't it our friend that sent us this app?

1321
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,340
Is he also in the game?

1322
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,740
Was our friend Anton?

1323
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:44,800
Or...

1324
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,180
Or...

1325
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:50,160
Is he wanting to share his girl with us?

1326
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:51,620
Hmm.

1327
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,740
Where are the card games?

1328
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,240
Let's play a video game.

1329
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,790
Alright, Mita.

1330
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,330
Whoa.

1331
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,430
It's a not PS5.

1332
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,770
Dairy scandal!

1333
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:12,570
Fighting game.

1334
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:15,770
Okay.

1335
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:17,950
Okay.

1336
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,230
Oh, wait.

1337
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,830
I did not...

1338
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:24,550
No!

1339
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,850
Can I...

1340
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,950
Can I redo?

1341
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:28,910
I actually...

1342
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:33,050
Okay.

1343
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,530
Oh, how do I attack?

1344
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:36,750
Oh.

1345
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:39,710
Oh my god.

1346
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:41,130
She's really good.

1347
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:43,030
She's ducking.

1348
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:46,190
Okay, maybe she's not as good as I thought.

1349
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:48,870
Damn.

1350
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,980
Oh god.

1351
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,020
I'm just spamming it!

1352
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,360
I'm just spamming attack!

1353
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:08,500
Attack!

1354
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:13,920
Okay.

1355
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:18,550
Yeah!

1356
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:19,190
Yeah!

1357
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:20,130
Come on, Mita!

1358
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:37,550
Yeah, Mita!

1359
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:38,490
Oh shoot!

1360
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:38,990
Oh shoot!

1361
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:43,050
I was holding it down, hoping...

1362
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:44,830
You are...

1363
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,280
Oh yeah.

1364
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,500
Beaten and sour.

1365
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:53,780
No, no.

1366
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,080
Let's keep going.

1367
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,220
Penguin piles.

1368
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,200
Okay.

1369
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,820
There's only these two games?

1370
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,540
Oh, okay.

1371
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,100
Mito sweep.

1372
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,060
Super simple.

1373
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,860
Just collect snowballs.

1374
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:16,940
Oh.

1375
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,060
Okay.

1376
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,160
Two.

1377
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:22,560
One.

1378
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,400
Go!

1379
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,260
I'm guessing I'm the one on the...

1380
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,940
Oh gosh.

1381
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:28,720
I'm going so fast.

1382
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,540
Oh shoot.

1383
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,300
Oh my god.

1384
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,260
I'm missing them all!

1385
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:37,900
No!

1386
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,180
That's a tie.

1387
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:51,890
This one is tough.

1388
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,370
Guys, I'm not good at this one.

1389
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:55,650
Guys, I need to go back to the...

1390
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,130
Oh my god.

1391
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,070
Oh, she's gonna beat me.

1392
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,250
She's hacking!

1393
01:18:58,830 --> 01:18:59,410
I swear.

1394
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:00,690
Okay.

1395
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:01,790
Nice, nice, nice.

1396
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:03,530
Nice, nice, nice.

1397
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,110
Oh my god.

1398
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:04,770
She's beating me.

1399
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:06,390
I can't do this.

1400
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:22,310
Wait!

1401
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:24,450
Ping.

1402
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,030
Okay.

1403
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,110
Okay.

1404
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,950
She...I swear.

1405
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,870
She was able to just turn...

1406
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:38,530
and immediately get to the snowball.

1407
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:39,730
You cheater!

1408
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:40,510
Mito!

1409
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:42,610
I'm gonna hold this against us.

1410
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,130
For the rest of our relationship.

1411
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,570
Oh, these are the car...

1412
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,230
Oh wait, what's this?

1413
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,690
Where did the portal go?

1414
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:00,510
Somewhere else.

1415
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,030
But if I wanted to go home...

1416
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,610
Is she eating a potato?

1417
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:12,290
Oh, chip?

1418
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,990
My girl is hungry for crackers.

1419
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:18,990
Get rotated, penguin.

1420
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:21,470
What's this?

1421
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,890
Okay, let's...

1422
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:24,970
Oh.

1423
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:25,170
Oh.

1424
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:26,890
Okay.

1425
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:31,030
This chip indicates a type.

1426
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,070
Okay.

1427
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,210
I'm taking my cards.

1428
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:54,810
Okay.

1429
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:57,970
What's that sound?

1430
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:00,810
There's like something...

1431
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:00,910
Oh.

1432
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:04,410
Oh, come on!

1433
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,250
Uh...

1434
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,190
Uh...

1435
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:09,390
Wait...

1436
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:11,970
There's like something knocking over there.

1437
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:12,690
Do you guys hear it?

1438
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:15,510
What sound?

1439
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,310
You guys don't hear?

1440
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,370
Is that outside my game?

1441
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,450
Is it...

1442
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:24,430
So I have to have a higher...

1443
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,210
No, it's definitely in the game.

1444
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:33,370
Um...

1445
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:34,530
I'm kinda confused.

1446
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:35,690
Would this be better?

1447
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:37,230
Because it actually has attack.

1448
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:41,350
But the other one has two defense.

1449
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,150
So two attack would be...

1450
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,130
Let me try it.

1451
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:45,790
Play the card.

1452
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:50,710
Oh, okay.

1453
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:53,590
Oh!

1454
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:54,810
Oh!

1455
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,190
I see!

1456
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:57,770
So it's whichever is...

1457
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:58,550
Oh, okay.

1458
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,050
Whichever is higher there.

1459
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:02,190
So this one's attack.

1460
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:04,150
So we need something with a powerful attack.

1461
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,110
Which we don't have.

1462
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:09,190
Oh, gosh.

1463
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:10,390
Okay.

1464
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:10,530
Okay.

1465
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,150
I understand now.

1466
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,130
Wow, this kinda sucks.

1467
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,550
This isn't great.

1468
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:24,730
Let's do this one, I guess.

1469
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:28,590
Yeah, rigged!

1470
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:30,450
Rigged!

1471
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:30,790
Real!

1472
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,590
Okay, highest health stat.

1473
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:36,490
Okay, we can definitely beat this one.

1474
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:39,050
We can definitely beat this one.

1475
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:43,350
We'll do this one because it's actually the best one we could play.

1476
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,910
Alright, focus on defense.

1477
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:51,430
Okay, okay.

1478
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:53,470
Okay.

1479
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,530
Wait, what did she play?

1480
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,760
Ten defense.

1481
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,300
We can at least tie, I suppose.

1482
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,840
Alright, attack!

1483
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,300
What's that sound?

1484
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:25,730
The music.

1485
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,170
It's coming from inside the wardrobe.

1486
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,860
Knocking as if someone's in there.

1487
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:42,490
I'd like to open it and check.

1488
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:43,790
I'm a bit creeped out.

1489
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:44,750
Oh?

1490
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:46,530
Oh?

1491
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,010
Open the wardrobe.

1492
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:50,950
No, we can keep playing!

1493
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,980
Are you hiding something from me?

1494
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,680
No, she took off the glasses!

1495
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:26,800
I'd like that too, but still...

1496
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,440
I just...

1497
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,920
I want to know what on earth that knocking was!

1498
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:41,940
Oh!

1499
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:45,560
Sick!

1500
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,580
Condition, complete the main story.

1501
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:49,960
Avoid looking in the vent!

1502
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,680
I already messed up!

1503
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,100
But I wouldn't be able to do it anyway because...

1504
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:57,800
Wait, have I tried?

1505
01:24:58,820 --> 01:24:59,900
It's locked.

1506
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:02,200
It's locked.

1507
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,520
We didn't complete the main story, you guys.

1508
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,720
Of course we wouldn't be able to.

1509
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:11,780
Refuge!

1510
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,680
If that's the case, check it right now.

1511
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:19,820
Oh?

1512
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,860
Creak in the dark.

1513
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,180
Oh!

1514
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,140
Turn off the radio.

1515
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,680
I can still hear it though.

1516
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:33,220
Oh!

1517
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,820
Want to play?

1518
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:37,860
Okay.

1519
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,180
Starting to get spooky!

1520
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:42,910
Spooky scary!

1521
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,020
Is this thing cursed again?

1522
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:46,780
No, it's normal.

1523
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:51,080
I don't like that we can keep hearing the banging though.

1524
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,280
Where's the radio?

1525
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,900
Oh, it's right over here.

1526
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,480
Check the kitchen.

1527
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,120
What's that sound?

1528
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,620
How's the brightness for you guys?

1529
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,200
I know it's obviously dark, but...

1530
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,100
What the hell?

1531
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,660
Oh my god, I cannot see anything.

1532
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,900
Except whatever's bouncing in there.

1533
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,540
The flashlight?

1534
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,760
Wait, was someone trying to grab it from the sink?

1535
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,000
That'd be kind of freaky.

1536
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,580
What is that?

1537
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,880
Oh, that's a shadow.

1538
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,300
I'm scared to turn around.

1539
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:38,460
Okay.

1540
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,380
What was that?

1541
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,160
Oh, the chair.

1542
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,640
Kind of freaky.

1543
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,940
Oh, don't look YouTube!

1544
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,700
Is that the banging we heard?

1545
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,180
Can I go in there?

1546
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,240
It's gone.

1547
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,320
Red means scary.

1548
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:12,840
But...

1549
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:13,720
Doesn't matter.

1550
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:17,930
P.T.

1551
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:19,810
P.T.

1552
01:27:19,890 --> 01:27:20,150
real.

1553
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,290
Is it the fish?

1554
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,710
I'm missing all the spooky stuff.

1555
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,630
Are you scared?

1556
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:31,730
Are you scared?

1557
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,810
Oh my gosh.

1558
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,110
It's not my fingers.

1559
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,610
Oh my god!

1560
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,830
Whose fingers?

1561
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:42,370
Are you scared?

1562
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:42,830
Are you scared?

1563
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:43,930
Are you scared?

1564
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:46,670
It really became P.T.

1565
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:48,090
for a second.

1566
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:53,890
You'll be.

1567
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:00,210
Oh!

1568
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,460
My sweet?

1569
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,420
My honey bunch?

1570
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:14,660
My...

1571
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,680
My...

1572
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,100
Darling sweetie pie?

1573
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,120
We can talk through this.

1574
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,500
Find me.

1575
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:27,560
Me.

1576
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,940
Find Mita.

1577
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,560
It's written everywhere now.

1578
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,300
Fio.

1579
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,370
Where could she be?

1580
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,010
Find me.

1581
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,950
If I were a crazed game girl.

1582
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:46,970
Want to play.

1583
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:48,250
Is she in here yet?

1584
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,870
We can't open it.

1585
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,870
Where would she be?

1586
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:56,710
Mita!

1587
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:58,910
Marco!

1588
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:00,830
Polo!

1589
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:03,750
This place only has like three rooms.

1590
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,250
Can't be that difficult to find her, right?

1591
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,310
Is she in the mirror?

1592
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,750
Is she on the ceiling?

1593
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:15,010
Polo!

1594
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:18,630
No, spooky?

1595
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:24,790
Polo!

1596
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:26,050
Is she...

1597
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:30,470
She's probably inside the TV and we have to reach around and grab her out, right?

1598
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,110
No.

1599
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:34,810
Where did that come from?

1600
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:35,970
That banging.

1601
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:37,850
Where did that come from?

1602
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:38,850
Oh, the chairs!

1603
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,530
I tried to go through it and she was just like...

1604
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,390
Don't even...

1605
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:47,470
Don't even try.

1606
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:51,630
She thinks I'm going to the door.

1607
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:52,730
No, honey!

1608
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,290
I'm not trying the door.

1609
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,350
That would be ridiculous.

1610
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:58,990
Trying to find you.

1611
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:01,870
Please let this be a normal future.

1612
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,430
Oh, we found her.

1613
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,210
Miss Rizzle.

1614
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:09,430
Mita.

1615
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,870
Mita.

1616
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:12,130
Mita, I found you.

1617
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:13,850
Mita?

1618
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,210
Oh my god!

1619
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,230
Something is staring at me.

1620
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,660
Something is...

1621
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,880
It's unwavering gaze.

1622
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,080
It's pulling me in.

1623
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:38,920
Mita.

1624
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,160
Maybe?

1625
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,440
My flashlight is kind of weak now.

1626
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,160
No!

1627
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,040
Follow Mita's lower body.

1628
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:49,580
With pleasure.

1629
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,720
Alright.

1630
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,060
She's all legs, everybody.

1631
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,140
Okay.

1632
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,000
A little rude.

1633
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,560
But it's not like she has arms or anything to hold the door open for me.

1634
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,020
So, I understand.

1635
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:17,600
Oh, a key.

1636
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:22,850
Find the basement.

1637
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:26,650
You mean over here?

1638
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:34,020
Oh.

1639
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:36,260
Oh.

1640
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,940
I thought she said there was only four rooms in this place.

1641
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,420
She's been holding out on me.

1642
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,760
Oh, nice.

1643
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,000
Oh, the basement.

1644
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:49,920
Okay.

1645
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,220
Oh?

1646
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:55,340
Well...

1647
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:58,020
Mom,

1648
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,240
I'm in the game!

1649
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:08,510
I'm in the game!

1650
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:11,130
Hold on.

1651
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:14,450
Wait, if I put him in the corner then he'll really look like a VTuber.

1652
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:19,690
Hey guys, welcome back to my channel.

1653
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:21,170
Today we are playing Misa.

1654
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:24,630
And...

1655
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:28,490
Yeah, as you can see, we're in this cute little house.

1656
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:32,330
And we're gonna be hitting on some ladies.

1657
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:33,130
Lady.

1658
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:37,190
Oh, sorry.

1659
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,310
I have two drinks here.

1660
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:41,630
I like how it's like a...

1661
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:42,570
What's it called?

1662
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,510
Like a traditional film.

1663
01:32:45,450 --> 01:32:46,010
Oh!

1664
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:47,050
Oh my god!

1665
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:55,670
I'm the headless anime protag.

1666
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:00,270
Here to haunt your humble abode.

1667
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:01,450
What's in here?

1668
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:04,370
Oh, what's that?

1669
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:06,870
We found one of these.

1670
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,310
Oh, yeah, bodyless.

1671
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:14,830
Yeah, that's right.

1672
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:20,870
Is that her still?

1673
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:20,970
Oh.

1674
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:25,170
God, there's so much banging everywhere.

1675
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:30,310
Why is it so metal?

1676
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:31,370
Metallic sounding.

1677
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,030
Okay, nevermind.

1678
01:33:35,090 --> 01:33:35,590
Interesting.

1679
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,420
Bing.

1680
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:46,280
Oh.

1681
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:47,540
Oh!

1682
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:48,800
Misa?

1683
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,480
You're Mita, aren't you?

1684
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,180
But there's something different about you.

1685
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:04,600
Is that...

1686
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,600
Is that sarcasm?

1687
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:12,980
Sinister.

1688
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,500
Something sinister.

1689
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:20,120
Oh.

1690
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:25,900
Oh.

1691
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:26,640
But...

1692
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:27,760
Okay, find the key.

1693
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:29,640
Find the key.

1694
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,100
Wait, what's going on over here?

1695
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,080
Whoa, this thing looks fun.

1696
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:36,260
What is this?

1697
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:36,660
Okay.

1698
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,600
The key, the key.

1699
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,760
Get the key, it's next to the sofa.

1700
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:42,680
Oh, here.

1701
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,580
I got it.

1702
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,200
What is...piggy.

1703
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,940
Piggy race.

1704
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:57,320
You're just a head and she was hips down, it'll work.

1705
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,740
With our powers combined.

1706
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,160
We will become the ultimate being.

1707
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,200
I'm looking for any other of those little tapes that I found.

1708
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,680
How can I trust you?

1709
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,380
Oh, I know, you're normal.

1710
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,380
Ah, whatever.

1711
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,520
The more the merrier, huh?

1712
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,480
Here, take it.

1713
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,560
Oh, the ring.

1714
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,740
This is the one we saw earlier.

1715
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:32,340
Well, maybe.

1716
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,800
I think she's tricking me.

1717
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:47,380
Me, me...

1718
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:51,620
Wrong finger.

1719
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:52,500
Okay.

1720
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:55,340
By the way, I'm...

1721
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,500
Cruel and terrible Mita.

1722
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,060
Oh, why are you locked up?

1723
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,300
I was with a certain player.

1724
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:20,260
Suddenly, everything changed.

1725
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:21,860
And then...

1726
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,480
She appeared.

1727
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,040
She turned the player into a cartridge.

1728
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,520
And locked him up.

1729
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,720
She is clearly crazy.

1730
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,600
What?

1731
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:04,060
Now that's a dark twist of me.

1732
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,760
But how?

1733
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,400
The ring will lead you to the right version.

1734
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:16,940
Let's meet there.

1735
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:26,990
I will stay here.

1736
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:29,370
I have something to ask her.

1737
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:34,770
I may not be able to have a normal conversation without knowing more about her.

1738
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,430
What I saw up there...

1739
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:48,770
That Mita...

1740
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,210
Was she trying to kill me?

1741
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:56,870
Okay.

1742
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,290
What do we do now?

1743
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:01,350
Yeah?

1744
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:03,010
The console?

1745
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:04,910
This.

1746
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:11,950
Are we watching a recording?

1747
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:15,330
Oh, she is building the thing.

1748
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:19,230
Oh, it's happening at this very moment.

1749
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:22,070
She is cheating on me!

1750
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,030
No!

1751
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,810
I need to get out of here ASAP.

1752
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,850
This guy wears flannel!

1753
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:36,790
Oh my god.

1754
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:39,110
So you are saying that she is using him.

1755
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,450
If I pull the cartridge out, what happens?

1756
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:51,030
Which means that the player will die.

1757
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:53,950
What if I just turn it off?

1758
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:58,350
But then won't she come here, right?

1759
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:00,110
She will just come to this...

1760
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:03,750
Yeah, I see the red button right there.

1761
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:05,130
Found it.

1762
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:06,510
That seems...

1763
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,450
I don't think this is a very good design, right?

1764
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:09,690
Because...

1765
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:12,570
It's like right on the side and it's sticking out.

1766
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:14,910
It's begging for you to push it.

1767
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:19,530
If I was just holding this thing, I would accidentally turn it off all the time, I feel.

1768
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:20,610
I'm holding it.

1769
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:25,810
I think we just killed this...

1770
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:26,490
Hide!

1771
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:28,910
Oh god.

1772
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:29,350
Wait, what?

1773
01:39:31,150 --> 01:39:32,210
That's what I said!

1774
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:33,850
Follow the ring.

1775
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:34,350
Okay.

1776
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:36,710
Here?

1777
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:37,810
I'm hiding?

1778
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:43,940
Where is she?

1779
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,180
I don't think this is a very good idea.

1780
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:06,920
Why are you so mean to us?

1781
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,520
I wonder where she came from.

1782
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:20,680
Okay.

1783
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,120
Redo!

1784
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,360
Redo!

1785
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,960
How was I supposed to know she would come from that side?

1786
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,200
Oh my goodness.

1787
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:32,940
Oh, there she is, right there.

1788
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:44,380
So we go to the right instead, maybe.

1789
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,620
The ring only pointed forward.

1790
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:04,620
I'm going.

1791
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,020
I'm going.

1792
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:13,790
Do I stay in here?

1793
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:15,910
I don't know where to go.

1794
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:18,550
She's just chilling over there.

1795
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:20,570
I'm in here.

1796
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:23,850
I'm going upstairs.

1797
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:26,010
Oh my god.

1798
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:26,950
I think she saw me.

1799
01:41:33,830 --> 01:41:35,250
This part is confusing.

1800
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:36,490
Yeah, kind of.

1801
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:39,350
Because it's like, follow the ring, but...

1802
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,650
It only tells me sometimes.

1803
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:43,270
I waited too long.

1804
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:44,750
Okay, upstairs but faster.

1805
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,610
Okay.

1806
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:49,790
Third time's a charm, baby.

1807
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:51,570
Also, what's in there?

1808
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:54,370
Interesting.

1809
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:59,780
She likes a challenge.

1810
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,800
I used to blow on cartridges to make them work.

1811
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:09,960
It gives a new perspective.

1812
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,400
It's funny that...

1813
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,600
Okay, let's go.

1814
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:16,840
My ring is pointing forward.

1815
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:18,280
Okay.

1816
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:23,940
Okay, I'm going.

1817
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,600
The game is beyond the world.

1818
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,740
Find a way out.

1819
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,140
That's not the right game.

1820
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:36,640
We're playing.

1821
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,140
Oh, wow.

1822
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:41,980
Look!

1823
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,340
See, hold on.

1824
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,800
We were stuck in the head.

1825
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,540
That's so funny.

1826
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:55,260
Such a boring.

1827
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:56,960
What is this?

1828
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,580
Meet the...

1829
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,360
Meet the hide.

1830
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:07,140
Wait, see, what is this symbol?

1831
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,080
Why is it that we've seen this twice now?

1832
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:18,940
Secret.

1833
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:20,400
Lame.

1834
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,900
Wow, what a lame secret.

1835
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:25,960
This sucks.

1836
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,940
Guys, I'm so sorry.

1837
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:33,720
Oh, she's so cute.

1838
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:35,600
Sorry.

1839
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:36,020
Okay.

1840
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,320
It's fine.

1841
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,140
It's saved.

1842
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:41,240
Here we go.

1843
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,220
Okay, okay.

1844
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:44,860
Find a way out.

1845
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,180
Look at all these toilet papers.

1846
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:56,360
This kind of looks like my blue archive, like cafe.

1847
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:01,620
I have it where it's just a bunch of...

1848
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:05,120
chairs set up looking at the shower.

1849
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,170
And those are just a bunch of couches...

1850
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,240
looking at the toilet.

1851
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,640
Oh, wait.

1852
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:16,900
Oh, okay.

1853
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,640
I guess this is where we're going.

1854
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,400
Fire extinguisher.

1855
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,280
Can't click on anything or whatever.

1856
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,780
Woah, liminal.

1857
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:28,960
Meet the house.

1858
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,500
Let's go to this way first.

1859
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:41,680
Okay, when I said find a way out, it meant...

1860
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,360
Oh, this is where we came from.

1861
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:43,580
Okay.

1862
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:47,020
No.

1863
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,760
Okay, this is the only way that we haven't gone.

1864
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,720
Did you pull for Kuroko yet?

1865
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,600
I have, yeah.

1866
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:59,280
I got her.

1867
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:01,540
I just had to spark for...

1868
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,280
for Hoshinodo.

1869
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,780
Wait, did we go down here?

1870
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:06,900
I don't think so.

1871
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:10,260
Maybe.

1872
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:19,240
Oh, here we go.

1873
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,540
A key or something in there?

1874
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:26,600
Ah.

1875
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,680
This looks like a front door.

1876
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,640
Hey, buddy.

1877
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,560
You are friendly?

1878
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,700
Hi.

1879
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,140
You new here?

1880
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:40,620
New?

1881
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:42,660
Oh my god.

1882
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:44,560
You're from the real world, aren't you?

1883
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,260
I am.

1884
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,240
Are you alright?

1885
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:50,220
It's just a limp.

1886
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,560
Don't worry about it.

1887
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,420
I've been here about a year.

1888
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,160
And I'm doing great.

1889
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:57,220
Right.

1890
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,600
What is this place?

1891
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,260
It's some sort of space between versions.

1892
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:05,800
Do you know how to get out of here?

1893
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:07,680
Can't say that I do.

1894
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,840
Besides, I don't want to leave.

1895
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:11,940
I don't need to.

1896
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,800
Why not?

1897
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:15,560
Enough chatting.

1898
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,120
I'm in a hurry.

1899
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:21,100
My beloved Mita is waiting for me.

1900
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,000
I have to find her.

1901
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,040
Goodbye.

1902
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:24,920
Wait!

1903
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:29,910
That guy is mean.

1904
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:33,190
Not if I find her first.

1905
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:38,250
My beloved Mita is actually wanting to talk to me instead.

1906
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:40,390
Oh, what's this?

1907
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:42,010
Zero out of three.

1908
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:43,850
Okay.

1909
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:48,190
This seems... Okay, so this is the way out.

1910
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:58,110
Chase the mini people.

1911
01:46:58,960 --> 01:46:59,310
What?

1912
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:04,050
Who am I?

1913
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:06,010
I'm chasing the mini people.

1914
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:08,890
Get to the exit.

1915
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:09,930
Get to the exit.

1916
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:11,010
Mini people.

1917
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:14,050
I miss Tomodachi life.

1918
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:15,730
I want to go home.

1919
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:16,290
Why?

1920
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:20,350
Go to the exit.

1921
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,590
Do I need three of them?

1922
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:24,430
I need three mini people.

1923
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:26,270
Oh my gosh.

1924
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:26,990
Come on.

1925
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,710
Got a free bed.

1926
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:30,050
This is not Minecraft.

1927
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,710
Come on.

1928
01:47:33,230 --> 01:47:33,710
Go.

1929
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:33,950
Go.

1930
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:34,330
Go.

1931
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:35,890
Go.

1932
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:36,270
Go.

1933
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:36,410
Go.

1934
01:47:36,610 --> 01:47:36,610
Go.

1935
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:37,670
There.

1936
01:47:37,810 --> 01:47:38,010
There.

1937
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:40,130
We captured one person.

1938
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:42,710
This doesn't seem very...

1939
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:43,830
Come on.

1940
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:45,170
Mini people.

1941
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:47,690
What happened yesterday?

1942
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:48,090
Nothing.

1943
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:48,750
Don't worry about it.

1944
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:49,210
Go inside.

1945
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:51,110
We are like little gerbils.

1946
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:53,990
Okay.

1947
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:54,690
Nice.

1948
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:55,170
This guy.

1949
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:56,690
He is our chosen one.

1950
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:57,950
Go in there.

1951
01:47:58,030 --> 01:47:58,590
Go in there.

1952
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:00,210
I got too much food.

1953
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:00,890
Perfect.

1954
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:03,050
That means it will taste delicious.

1955
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:05,390
Wait.

1956
01:48:05,450 --> 01:48:06,270
What if we get all of them?

1957
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:06,710
No.

1958
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:06,850
No.

1959
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:07,010
No.

1960
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:07,490
Come on.

1961
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:07,670
Come on.

1962
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:08,910
Come on.

1963
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:09,050
Come on.

1964
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:09,350
Go in.

1965
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:14,020
One more.

1966
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:15,440
I'm running out of patience.

1967
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:16,640
Come here.

1968
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:17,160
Come on.

1969
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:17,480
Come on.

1970
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,340
Come on.

1971
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:20,540
No.

1972
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:20,680
No.

1973
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:20,920
No.

1974
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:21,200
No.

1975
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:21,300
No.

1976
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:21,740
Yeah.

1977
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:21,980
Yeah.

1978
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:22,200
Yeah.

1979
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:22,360
Yeah.

1980
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:22,560
Yeah.

1981
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:24,460
No.

1982
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:24,800
No.

1983
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:25,020
No.

1984
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:25,220
No.

1985
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:25,600
No.

1986
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:25,840
Yeah.

1987
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,060
Yeah.

1988
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:26,320
Yeah.

1989
01:48:26,420 --> 01:48:26,540
Yeah.

1990
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:26,700
Yeah.

1991
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:33,270
I don't think I can get this guy though.

1992
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,210
I wish I could just pick him up.

1993
01:48:37,330 --> 01:48:39,050
He is fighting demons right now.

1994
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:39,410
It's fun.

1995
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:40,910
Is that how tall you are?

1996
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,190
Shut up.

1997
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:43,530
Wait.

1998
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:44,550
What was the objective?

1999
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:45,250
Oh here.

2000
01:48:45,790 --> 01:48:47,470
The objective was here.

2001
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:59,650
Oopsy daisy.

2002
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:03,710
You only needed three.

2003
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:05,330
Yeah, but I'm an overachiever.

2004
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:14,130
Oh, the music.

2005
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:16,450
That doesn't seem great.

2006
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:25,190
What's in here?

2007
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:28,110
Door number...

2008
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:29,790
Oh, wrong room.

2009
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:30,030
Sorry.

2010
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,510
I'm finding my perfect Mita.

2011
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:39,790
Oh, this one has an arcade.

2012
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:42,910
Hold on.

2013
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:46,130
What is this?

2014
01:49:46,190 --> 01:49:47,270
Oh, I found another one.

2015
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:48,950
Another cartridge.

2016
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:49,730
Nice.

2017
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:52,930
Added character profile.

2018
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:54,090
Wait, did we go in this one?

2019
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:54,830
I don't think so.

2020
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,330
Oh, they all have it.

2021
01:49:58,550 --> 01:50:00,110
Oh, excuse me.

2022
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:03,170
Are they all the same?

2023
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:04,170
Oh man.

2024
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:07,510
Hello.

2025
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:11,370
I'm here to play Space Car.

2026
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:14,490
Oh, I'm actually here to play Space Car.

2027
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,720
Oh my gosh, so cute!

2028
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,580
Any button to start the race.

2029
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:28,060
Let's go.

2030
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:34,540
Holy moly.

2031
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:44,410
I'm in not so great of a place though.

2032
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:46,090
Can I destroy this guy?

2033
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:47,390
Shoot.

2034
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:48,670
Kill him.

2035
01:50:50,030 --> 01:50:50,390
Blue shell!

2036
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:50,870
Blue shell!

2037
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:51,430
Blue shell!

2038
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:53,190
Blue shell!

2039
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:53,810
Blue shell!

2040
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:54,030
Blue shell!

2041
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,080
We're still playing Misai, you guys.

2042
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,000
Is it my side?

2043
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:12,740
I mean, I assume it's my side because like...

2044
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,420
That's kind of like what the game...

2045
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:16,200
She's like, welcome to my side.

2046
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,300
But I can't stop saying Misai.

2047
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,100
Like, milady.

2048
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:20,300
Misai.

2049
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:25,540
Every time I boost, they get further and further away.

2050
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:26,360
Come on.

2051
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,180
Here we go.

2052
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:31,480
Here we go.

2053
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:31,880
Here we go.

2054
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:32,560
Oh my gosh.

2055
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:33,680
Shoot.

2056
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:34,280
I missed one.

2057
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,080
That's ok.

2058
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:36,460
No!

2059
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,080
They're so fast!

2060
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,420
When do we...

2061
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:43,640
The laps.

2062
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:45,480
How many laps are there?

2063
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,480
I'm in first.

2064
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,600
I'm in first.

2065
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:51,300
No!

2066
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,020
Let's go.

2067
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,000
Misai.

2068
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,600
Like Mita.

2069
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:03,720
That makes sense.

2070
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:09,800
Invasion?

2071
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,240
Defeat the boss?

2072
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,820
What?

2073
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:27,580
Oh no.

2074
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:28,520
Oh!

2075
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:34,070
Ok.

2076
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:38,890
There's no boost, by the way, in case you were like...

2077
01:52:38,890 --> 01:52:39,550
Boost added.

2078
01:52:39,810 --> 01:52:40,490
There is none.

2079
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:46,500
Oh!

2080
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:47,380
What the hell is this?

2081
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:48,520
Get

2082
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:52,650
off my ass!

2083
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:54,930
Oh, now I can shift.

2084
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,210
Ok.

2085
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,890
Oh, I have to battle this thing, I think.

2086
01:53:01,410 --> 01:53:01,850
Yeah!

2087
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:02,830
Yeah!

2088
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:03,990
Ok.

2089
01:53:03,990 --> 01:53:07,670
Ok, we have to do that one...

2090
01:53:07,670 --> 01:53:08,430
Oh my gosh.

2091
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:10,950
This is longer than I expected it to be.

2092
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:15,770
I love games within games within games.

2093
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:17,170
Oh my gosh.

2094
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:21,610
Ok.

2095
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:27,410
Rocks.

2096
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:29,190
Rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks.

2097
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:31,550
Rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks.

2098
01:53:32,650 --> 01:53:33,090
Nice.

2099
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:36,010
Kinda cruising a little bit here.

2100
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:38,690
I wonder if it's a one-hit KO for me.

2101
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:40,470
No!

2102
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,550
Get off my ass!

2103
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:44,910
Mita can wait.

2104
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:45,790
She's just watching me.

2105
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:47,350
She's just like, whoa, he's so cool.

2106
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:48,650
Playing that game.

2107
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:56,030
No, those hearts aren't mine.

2108
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:56,990
They're the boss's.

2109
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:02,070
And which means we just have to do this one more time.

2110
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,350
And we win, baby.

2111
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:06,570
We're so good.

2112
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:15,390
Nice.

2113
01:54:16,230 --> 01:54:16,930
Alright, rocks.

2114
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:18,510
Rocks.

2115
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:20,670
Rocks, rocks, rocks.

2116
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:22,630
Rocks, rocks.

2117
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:24,690
Rocks, rocks, rocks.

2118
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:27,170
Rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks.

2119
01:54:28,170 --> 01:54:29,250
Alright.

2120
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:36,110
Alright, let's get this sucker.

2121
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:42,430
Kick his ass!

2122
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,470
Accelerate.

2123
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:55,510
Mita cart double dash.

2124
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,630
We're too good at the game.

2125
01:54:57,770 --> 01:54:59,130
Mita, I beat your high score.

2126
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:01,370
What did you think of that?

2127
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:06,150
Oh,

2128
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,070
sorry.

2129
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:14,210
Sorry, sorry.

2130
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:17,930
No, don't take my ring!

2131
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:22,250
How sensual.

2132
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:23,490
What are you doing?

2133
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:29,290
What did you do?

2134
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:30,790
What did you do?

2135
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:35,390
I like her, like, her...

2136
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:36,530
Face.

2137
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:39,230
Should I trust you?

2138
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:51,030
Sweetheart.

2139
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:57,750
True.

2140
01:55:58,850 --> 01:56:00,250
What is this place?

2141
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:10,550
Wait, what?

2142
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:15,870
Her house?

2143
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:18,170
Oh, no.

2144
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:21,510
Oh.

2145
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:27,170
Okay, that's not great, is it now?

2146
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:31,450
How did I get here?

2147
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:33,410
The ring?

2148
01:56:41,110 --> 01:56:42,750
Why did that guy have a collar though?

2149
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:43,690
He's really freaky.

2150
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:46,170
We have a ring, but...

2151
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:49,370
But that guy, he was just like, give me that collar, girl.

2152
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:51,170
I'll bark for you.

2153
01:56:52,270 --> 01:56:53,270
How did you get here?

2154
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,510
I'm not kink shaming, I'm just saying.

2155
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:12,310
Oh, how...

2156
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:15,990
I'm trusting her less and less.

2157
01:57:16,790 --> 01:57:18,270
What did you do to the ring?

2158
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:26,790
Okay.

2159
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:29,750
Minto side.

2160
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:29,830
Good.

2161
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:36,430
Okay, but the passage is dangerous.

2162
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:42,130
I've seen all manner of strange things ever since I arrived into this game.

2163
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:47,590
Everything seems quiet here, but the passages feel anything but safe.

2164
01:57:48,570 --> 01:57:48,970
Oh, no.

2165
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:52,790
Oh.

2166
01:57:58,870 --> 01:57:59,610
Okay.

2167
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:04,530
Okay, I certainly hope all goes well.

2168
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,730
But what lives in these passages?

2169
01:58:10,730 --> 01:58:11,470
Anomalies.

2170
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:14,390
Oh, I don't like that.

2171
01:58:16,730 --> 01:58:20,170
I feel like I should have followed after that guy.

2172
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:23,030
Oh, they're hostile Mitas.

2173
01:58:23,550 --> 01:58:25,190
More crazy, unfitting ones.

2174
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:28,350
Ugly Mita.

2175
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:30,510
That's so mean.

2176
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:33,310
Uh-huh.

2177
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:34,390
Oh.

2178
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:36,710
Oh.

2179
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:44,330
I think we're gonna run into ugly Mita.

2180
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:48,070
I see.

2181
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:49,610
Will you help me escape?

2182
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:06,730
Kind Mita, ain't that the truth?

2183
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:08,510
You mentioned a plan?

2184
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:11,690
The core.

2185
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:19,890
But why not go there yourself?

2186
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:20,990
Why do you need a player?

2187
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:38,730
Ah, okay.

2188
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:41,650
Okay.

2189
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:48,410
Cool Mita.

2190
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:53,750
Cappy.

2191
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:01,290
Okay.

2192
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:02,530
Cappy.

2193
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:11,250
Cappy.

2194
02:00:12,090 --> 02:00:13,890
She's so...

2195
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:18,110
She's so cute!

2196
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:24,030
No!

2197
02:00:30,290 --> 02:00:30,990
Cappy!

2198
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:40,970
They're so cute!

2199
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:42,390
Oh my gosh, I can't.

2200
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:47,750
Okay.

2201
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:49,950
Already?

2202
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,670
We just started this plan!

2203
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:58,350
Look how cute she is.

2204
02:01:02,690 --> 02:01:03,730
Oh, Cappy.

2205
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:08,650
Hm.

2206
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:13,150
Right, so what do we do?

2207
02:01:15,730 --> 02:01:16,350
Okay.

2208
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:19,070
What did crazy Mita do to her?

2209
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:21,670
She reset her.

2210
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:26,010
She killed her?

2211
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:26,350
Oh.

2212
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,450
I don't think she agrees.

2213
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,250
Cool Mita will simply reboot.

2214
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:37,530
Oh.

2215
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:45,610
So she doesn't remember.

2216
02:01:46,150 --> 02:01:47,150
Oh, that's horrible.

2217
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:50,610
Better than disappearing forever, I guess.

2218
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:54,470
She doesn't remember anything about how to do the portal.

2219
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:57,050
What about us players?

2220
02:01:58,230 --> 02:02:00,530
Will killing us reset our memories too?

2221
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:07,550
Oh.

2222
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:12,770
Cappy's got crazy side eye.

2223
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:16,490
Always cartridges.

2224
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:20,390
So how can I tell if I'm a cartridge or not?

2225
02:02:24,190 --> 02:02:24,410
Oh.

2226
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:26,590
Okay, madam.

2227
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:30,510
We're roleplaying TSA right now.

2228
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:34,010
She says, come through the portal.

2229
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:35,750
Or the thing.

2230
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:37,050
The scanner.

2231
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,910
Put your hands up.

2232
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:43,150
Oh no.

2233
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:45,830
I have to give you a thorough check.

2234
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:46,710
Oh.

2235
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:52,570
Oh, I have nothing sussy on me.

2236
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,850
Yippee!

2237
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:56,070
That's good news.

2238
02:03:03,570 --> 02:03:03,950
Yet?

2239
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:06,470
Yeah, the metal detector.

2240
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:08,930
Sorry, my brain can't think of words sometimes.

2241
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:13,290
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

2242
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:16,510
I don't think that's a good idea.

2243
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:17,050
What do you think?

2244
02:03:17,370 --> 02:03:18,230
What do you think, Cappy?

2245
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:21,230
What do you think?

2246
02:03:23,470 --> 02:03:24,250
Look at that.

2247
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:26,250
Not a thought behind those eyes.

2248
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:29,550
I think I can... I don't...

2249
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,380
That's awkward.

2250
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:38,440
I think I'm gonna see myself out.

2251
02:03:39,980 --> 02:03:40,800
Okay,

2252
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,920
there is my ring.

2253
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:58,460
Got a route in mind?

2254
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:07,680
We're going to the core.

2255
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:10,880
Hi!

2256
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:12,460
Then I have to go alone?

2257
02:04:13,980 --> 02:04:17,000
But I don't know the way or even how I'll get there.

2258
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:21,100
I like how she keeps calling him sweetheart and darling.

2259
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:27,420
Okay.

2260
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,260
Okay.

2261
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:32,460
Okay.

2262
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:34,720
Ten minutes.

2263
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:35,840
Easy peasy.

2264
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,140
Alright, sit down.

2265
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:39,240
Do your thing, girl.

2266
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:44,200
Yeah.

2267
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,300
You wanna come with?

2268
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:51,960
She's talking.

2269
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:52,780
Yeah.

2270
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:56,900
She is so cute.

2271
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,140
Oh my god.

2272
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:04,660
Boom!

2273
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,160
Oh my god.

2274
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:10,180
Oh, not it?

2275
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:11,660
She has different colored panties.

2276
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:13,780
She has a guitar!

2277
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:18,300
Oh my god.

2278
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:18,940
She's so cute.

2279
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:21,480
Yeah!

2280
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:22,920
Go ahead.

2281
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,880
Yeah!

2282
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:35,870
It's kinda emo.

2283
02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:39,490
Yeah.

2284
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:41,190
She heard me?

2285
02:05:41,410 --> 02:05:42,970
She heard me for real.

2286
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:45,950
You're quite the energetic one.

2287
02:05:47,770 --> 02:05:48,150
Yeah!

2288
02:05:50,890 --> 02:05:51,650
Oh.

2289
02:05:53,590 --> 02:05:54,950
Yeah, let's go.

2290
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:58,230
That's one way to get off the bed.

2291
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:00,830
Wait, what?

2292
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:02,010
What just happened?

2293
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:05,910
Do you remember anything?

2294
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:07,790
What's your plan?

2295
02:06:11,790 --> 02:06:12,210
Alright.

2296
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:14,230
You've lost your memories.

2297
02:06:18,130 --> 02:06:19,710
She's sticking out her tongue at me.

2298
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:22,250
If you do that again, I'm gonna grab it.

2299
02:06:29,050 --> 02:06:29,570
Yeah.

2300
02:06:35,110 --> 02:06:36,970
Do you always wear that cap?

2301
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:40,130
Don't you grow tired of wearing that cap?

2302
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:42,810
And don't those gloves get warm?

2303
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:44,650
Why not take them off?

2304
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:48,950
That's like her...

2305
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:52,170
We're such a jonkler.

2306
02:06:56,410 --> 02:06:58,150
I was being serious here.

2307
02:06:58,650 --> 02:06:59,730
I'm coming in!

2308
02:06:59,850 --> 02:07:01,130
Oh my gosh, she's too cute.

2309
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,810
She's too cute!

2310
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:05,830
I'm stuck here.

2311
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:08,410
What do you think of ring-bearing Mita?

2312
02:07:09,590 --> 02:07:12,870
How does seeing an exact replica of yourself feel?

2313
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:16,510
You know, the one with the ring.

2314
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:21,770
To surprise her?

2315
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:28,950
Yeah.

2316
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:31,150
Yeah.

2317
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:35,030
So true, so sad.

2318
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,090
Yeah.

2319
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:42,370
Yeah.

2320
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:43,230
What else?

2321
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:44,590
Oh, I'm following you.

2322
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:46,490
I'm following... Oh, what's this?

2323
02:07:47,930 --> 02:07:49,470
I think I'll just wait.

2324
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:49,930
No!

2325
02:07:50,750 --> 02:07:51,910
We're gonna play!

2326
02:07:56,430 --> 02:07:58,330
She also has makeup on.

2327
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:59,650
Like the little teardrop.

2328
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:06,320
Okay, we're gonna play a video game.

2329
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:08,520
We're gonna play a video game in here.

2330
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:12,060
Oh, what is this?

2331
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,500
Cappy is such a vibe.

2332
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,340
I think it's broken.

2333
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:38,640
Oopsie!

2334
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:40,680
Navy.

2335
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,200
Oh my gosh, wait, the pictures are different too.

2336
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,900
This one looks like...

2337
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:48,820
It looks like...

2338
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:50,720
Fansa.

2339
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:51,740
Are

2340
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:57,820
people spoiling?

2341
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,840
Stop spoiling!

2342
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:05,680
Oh, there's a button here.

2343
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:08,120
Hold on, let's ask her about other stuff.

2344
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,240
I don't know if it's the...

2345
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:11,800
Oh wait, this is a game too.

2346
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:14,420
I don't know if the 10 minutes is real time or what.

2347
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:15,360
So let's try this.

2348
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:18,800
These are some pretty awesome photos.

2349
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,940
You sure are a good laugh, eh?

2350
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:28,540
Oh!

2351
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:29,280
Bang!

2352
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:33,200
Showed who exactly?

2353
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:40,720
Who are you talking about?

2354
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:41,200
What?

2355
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:43,260
Huh?

2356
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:44,340
Cappy?

2357
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:47,880
She's like, sure, show them.

2358
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:49,020
Who's them?

2359
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:50,420
It doesn't matter.

2360
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,860
Yeah, you guys, please stop backseating.

2361
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:56,720
I see you guys saying to do things.

2362
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:59,820
And the more you spam it, the more I'm not going to do it.

2363
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:02,680
So please, seriously, just let me play the game, okay?

2364
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,080
Rereading all of them, huh?

2365
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:07,780
Because you're bored?

2366
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:14,120
Nobody has so many.

2367
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,180
That's one way to look at things.

2368
02:10:18,900 --> 02:10:20,120
But without theory.

2369
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:25,020
Touch.

2370
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:37,500
I'm sure we could.

2371
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:41,380
Cappy, is that what you're trying to say, huh?

2372
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,000
I like the way she also wiggles.

2373
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:43,660
What are you doing?

2374
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,020
One, two, three.

2375
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:49,960
Interesting.

2376
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:52,120
Cappy, why are you counting?

2377
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:55,460
What are you counting for?

2378
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:56,300
Can we leave?

2379
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:02,200
Okay.

2380
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,200
Let's see what's in there.

2381
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:06,580
Okay.

2382
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,900
Why are you riling yourself up?

2383
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:18,500
Kinda saucy, Cappy.

2384
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:21,840
What game should we play?

2385
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:24,400
We have whatever the heck the steppy step is.

2386
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:25,820
Okay.

2387
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:28,660
We have the button in here.

2388
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,220
Kinda curious about the button.

2389
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:34,160
There's so many.

2390
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:35,860
What for?

2391
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:44,180
I like...

2392
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,080
Oh yeah?

2393
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,280
That's my favorite?

2394
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:48,740
That's my favorite!

2395
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:51,620
Right, I got it.

2396
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:04,560
She's dancing.

2397
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:06,840
She's... look at her.

2398
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:09,780
Yeah, she's grooving, she's schmoving.

2399
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:12,740
Alright, we got this game and then we have...

2400
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,200
Oh, what's this?

2401
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:15,360
What a cute kitty cat.

2402
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:17,520
Oh, what?

2403
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:18,860
What?

2404
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,860
You don't eat cats.

2405
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:31,310
Oh!

2406
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:38,430
Yeah.

2407
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:40,810
Yeah, they're real cute.

2408
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:43,250
I like cats.

2409
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:44,710
Yeah, me too.

2410
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:48,110
It's the way she came up to me like...

2411
02:12:57,660 --> 02:12:59,320
I got her character profile.

2412
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:01,380
That's fun.

2413
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:06,990
I want to play the button.

2414
02:13:06,990 --> 02:13:09,470
What a nice big button.

2415
02:13:10,190 --> 02:13:10,770
Button.

2416
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:13,090
I really want to press it.

2417
02:13:13,450 --> 02:13:13,910
Can I?

2418
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:19,470
Oh, okay.

2419
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:20,430
I'm sitting.

2420
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:24,510
Right.

2421
02:13:26,190 --> 02:13:28,790
The physics on the skirt go crazy.

2422
02:13:29,130 --> 02:13:29,950
Can I press the button?

2423
02:13:32,330 --> 02:13:32,710
Oh yeah?

2424
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:33,110
Okay.

2425
02:13:34,910 --> 02:13:35,810
What's that?

2426
02:13:37,530 --> 02:13:38,770
Like something...

2427
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:41,150
Like something to raise the stakes.

2428
02:13:41,290 --> 02:13:41,770
Like that.

2429
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:43,550
Huh?

2430
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:04,210
I haven't seen any beavers around.

2431
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,410
Why did we say that?

2432
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:08,150
Cappy?

2433
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:14,370
It was a back massager.

2434
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:18,010
I don't know.

2435
02:14:19,530 --> 02:14:19,830
Yeah.

2436
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:26,590
Oh, okay, okay.

2437
02:14:32,350 --> 02:14:34,350
I kind of want that.

2438
02:14:36,230 --> 02:14:37,450
You're going to hit me?

2439
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:42,970
I love those hammer space squeaky hammers.

2440
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:45,830
Oops.

2441
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:52,270
Ouch!

2442
02:14:53,370 --> 02:14:54,810
Can you hold back?

2443
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:57,950
No.

2444
02:14:59,170 --> 02:14:59,990
It didn't hurt.

2445
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:00,450
It's okay.

2446
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:01,230
Alright, alright, alright.

2447
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:01,730
We got this.

2448
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:05,290
Ah!

2449
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:10,380
Okay.

2450
02:15:12,030 --> 02:15:13,800
I'm getting used to this.

2451
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:16,000
Welcome!

2452
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:17,160
Thanks for the raid!

2453
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:18,300
Okay.

2454
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:20,540
Two.

2455
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:25,460
Smack her!

2456
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:27,160
Hit hard.

2457
02:15:33,890 --> 02:15:35,810
I'm going to kick your ass!

2458
02:15:35,890 --> 02:15:36,330
Okay, okay.

2459
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:40,670
Yeah!

2460
02:15:43,070 --> 02:15:43,870
Hard!

2461
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:50,330
Okay, doesn't it hurt?

2462
02:15:53,990 --> 02:15:54,610
Yeah!

2463
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:55,250
Okay.

2464
02:15:55,870 --> 02:15:56,450
This is it?

2465
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:57,770
This is it?

2466
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:07,620
I don't think this is for me.

2467
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:16,280
Now you are cute.

2468
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,240
That's it?

2469
02:16:28,970 --> 02:16:30,010
She's so cute.

2470
02:16:30,910 --> 02:16:38,230
I like idols that will wear contacts that make their eyes really dark like this.

2471
02:16:38,610 --> 02:16:40,730
So she's appealing to my type.

2472
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:43,210
Let's try this one.

2473
02:16:46,090 --> 02:16:47,630
Okay, what is this?

2474
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:48,610
Cracker!

2475
02:16:49,130 --> 02:16:50,130
What are you calling me?

2476
02:16:50,130 --> 02:16:51,790
It's so tiny.

2477
02:16:55,630 --> 02:16:55,950
Okay.

2478
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:03,000
Bubble drink.

2479
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,320
Let's do bubble drink.

2480
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,540
Let's go with this one.

2481
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:15,000
Alright.

2482
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:21,140
Yeah, show how it's done.

2483
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,280
Oh, she's pushing.

2484
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:22,600
Okay.

2485
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:23,560
Sure, sure.

2486
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:24,500
I'm watching.

2487
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:34,000
Oh my god, she's so good at this game.

2488
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:34,800
Yes!

2489
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:36,980
Yes, Mita!

2490
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:38,700
Yes!

2491
02:17:57,150 --> 02:18:00,150
We need to go lower.

2492
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:03,230
What the?

2493
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:10,490
It's not as flipped up as it was before.

2494
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:11,750
What happened?

2495
02:18:23,090 --> 02:18:27,770
We truly could not be any more apathetic to this situation.

2496
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:36,770
Man, you have the bestest cutest girl ever right in front of you.

2497
02:18:38,930 --> 02:18:43,090
Please act more disinterested.

2498
02:18:43,830 --> 02:18:44,510
What is this one?

2499
02:18:45,770 --> 02:18:46,970
No thanks bro!

2500
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:48,310
How to win an argument.

2501
02:18:49,530 --> 02:18:50,990
Wait, what else is in here?

2502
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:54,010
Can I go outside of bounds with the camera?

2503
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:05,160
She's waiting for us.

2504
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:09,720
Space car!

2505
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,160
Space car!

2506
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:15,820
It's still here!

2507
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:20,240
Other Mita is waiting.

2508
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:21,320
I think she's done.

2509
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:27,040
You done other Mita?

2510
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,480
She's like concerned.

2511
02:19:29,600 --> 02:19:31,120
She's like why haven't they come back yet?

2512
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:32,060
Oops, sorry.

2513
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:38,840
Oh, I didn't realize that I could quick move.

2514
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,720
Back, back, back, back to continue.

2515
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:47,890
The music stopped.

2516
02:19:48,170 --> 02:19:49,790
So she's just hopping to nothing.

2517
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:56,790
I've been married a long time ago.

2518
02:19:57,110 --> 02:19:58,350
Where did she come from?

2519
02:19:58,470 --> 02:19:59,230
Where did she go?

2520
02:19:59,650 --> 02:20:00,950
Where did she come from?

2521
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:02,010
Cotton Eye Joe.

2522
02:20:02,530 --> 02:20:04,630
Have I been for Cotton Eye Joe?

2523
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:07,230
I've been married a long time ago.

2524
02:20:07,370 --> 02:20:08,890
Where did she come from?

2525
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:09,870
Where did she go?

2526
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:11,670
Where did she come from?

2527
02:20:11,770 --> 02:20:12,650
Cotton Eye Joe.

2528
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:15,390
Have I been for Cotton Eye Joe?

2529
02:20:15,850 --> 02:20:20,370
I've been married a long time ago.

2530
02:20:28,970 --> 02:20:29,950
Thank you!

2531
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:31,070
My turn!

2532
02:20:35,490 --> 02:20:36,710
Thanks for the gift!

2533
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:37,430
Dead!

2534
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:38,050
Oh, S.

2535
02:20:44,250 --> 02:20:46,390
I already messed up!

2536
02:20:46,450 --> 02:20:48,010
I want to redo, please!

2537
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:51,110
I thought it was W instead of S.

2538
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:56,050
No, can I restore?

2539
02:21:18,140 --> 02:21:19,300
Guitar Hero!

2540
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:20,420
Yeah!

2541
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:31,780
One off.

2542
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:32,580
No!

2543
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:41,080
Another round?

2544
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:42,300
OK, one more, one more.

2545
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:45,000
You get to go again?

2546
02:21:56,260 --> 02:21:58,200
OK, we can't leave while she does that.

2547
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:59,100
Wait, can we?

2548
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,500
That'd be kind of crazy, right?

2549
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:08,100
The whole room flashes...

2550
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:10,400
when she does this.

2551
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:13,300
I like the noodle picture.

2552
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:14,160
I almost said spaghetti.

2553
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:17,140
My Japanese spaghetti.

2554
02:22:28,980 --> 02:22:30,840
Maybe I can get her skirt this time.

2555
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,380
OK, we did it.

2556
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:58,040
We already knew that they were white.

2557
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,380
From the very beginning.

2558
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:05,680
Good job!

2559
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:07,940
OK!

2560
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:11,720
What song is this?

2561
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,200
Oh.

2562
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:20,700
Not the same song?

2563
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:21,620
OK.

2564
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,420
Since we are not moving...

2565
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:40,440
I can imagine the model just kind of like...

2566
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:43,100
standing there.

2567
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:45,300
If we went out of bounds right now.

2568
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:48,680
Like T-posing or something.

2569
02:23:58,910 --> 02:24:02,030
Why is this so much more difficult than the previous one?

2570
02:24:03,370 --> 02:24:05,470
Not to say that it's difficult, but you know what I mean.

2571
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:07,170
The other one was like no notes.

2572
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:18,530
I think I'm

2573
02:24:22,390 --> 02:24:22,570
good.

2574
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:23,870
I got the achievement.

2575
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:27,410
Yeah, we're done.

2576
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:29,970
Let's go check on other Mita.

2577
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:33,470
OK, one second.

2578
02:24:33,630 --> 02:24:34,550
I do have to pee though.

2579
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:37,430
I have to go to the little ghost's room.

2580
02:24:37,790 --> 02:24:38,670
Real fast.

2581
02:24:39,150 --> 02:24:42,610
Here, actually you can just watch Mita.

2582
02:24:42,770 --> 02:24:45,390
See if she does anything really interesting or fun and cute.

2583
02:24:46,010 --> 02:24:52,470
Or if not, also look if she has any suspicious behavior as well.

2584
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:54,050
Just watch her.

2585
02:24:54,230 --> 02:24:55,010
Just watch her.

2586
02:24:55,150 --> 02:24:57,230
Just watch her.

2587
02:24:57,370 --> 02:24:58,030
Just watch her.

2588
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:01,720
What's happening?

2589
02:27:04,580 --> 02:27:05,880
What just happened?

2590
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,160
What just happened?

2591
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:17,730
What just happened?

2592
02:27:18,350 --> 02:27:19,550
I just came back!

2593
02:27:21,490 --> 02:27:22,950
She stole my game?

2594
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:24,850
Wait, what do you mean my game?

2595
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:28,530
She stole my game?

2596
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:29,490
I had a Game Boy?

2597
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:31,270
Wait, oh, here we go.

2598
02:27:32,830 --> 02:27:34,270
Wow, what's that?

2599
02:27:34,810 --> 02:27:35,410
A console?

2600
02:27:36,130 --> 02:27:36,890
Let me have a go.

2601
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,310
Uh-oh.

2602
02:27:37,530 --> 02:27:38,690
What do you do in this one?

2603
02:27:38,830 --> 02:27:40,870
You just collect coins and avoid frogs.

2604
02:27:41,230 --> 02:27:42,550
God, that sounds beyond boring.

2605
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:44,090
Seriously, you call that a game?

2606
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:45,510
No!

2607
02:27:46,190 --> 02:27:47,550
Oh, my Game Boy.

2608
02:27:48,010 --> 02:27:48,330
No!

2609
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:50,290
No, my Game Boy!

2610
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:56,460
It took me longer.

2611
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,660
I opened my door and my cat, she came running at me.

2612
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:01,660
She was just like, let me into your room!

2613
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:05,000
And then we started playing without you.

2614
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:08,540
I can't believe she took it!

2615
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:09,340
Anyway.

2616
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:12,640
And so, now I have my cat in here.

2617
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:17,040
But she'll probably run out in like a few minutes, so...

2618
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:20,060
My ring!

2619
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,160
No!

2620
02:28:29,940 --> 02:28:32,240
I tried to pick up the Game Boy, it wouldn't let me.

2621
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:36,460
Oh, okay.

2622
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:40,320
Okay.

2623
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:42,380
Okay.

2624
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,480
Yeah.

2625
02:28:50,820 --> 02:28:51,980
Oh, she does?

2626
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:54,220
Okay.

2627
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:58,800
Alright.

2628
02:28:59,860 --> 02:29:02,940
I hope I'll live long enough to meet you again.

2629
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:04,200
I hope so.

2630
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:07,660
Okay.

2631
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:09,760
Bye-bye!

2632
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,520
Well, let me pick it up!

2633
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,980
Bye, Cat B.

2634
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:16,860
You're so cute.

2635
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,600
Bye, other Mita.

2636
02:29:18,880 --> 02:29:21,240
Mita, I think you need to brush your hair a little bit.

2637
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:24,520
Whoever gave you this cut...

2638
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:28,840
I'm scared!

2639
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:34,240
And there goes my cat.

2640
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:34,800
Stop!

2641
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:35,280
Stop.

2642
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,280
Stop it.

2643
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:37,680
Stop.

2644
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:40,580
Yeah.

2645
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:41,260
Stop.

2646
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:43,820
Sorry, she tries to climb on top of stuff.

2647
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:46,400
Okay, bye-bye!

2648
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:47,480
Bye!

2649
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:50,700
Oh, I have to click on it.

2650
02:29:56,230 --> 02:29:57,350
1.3B.

2651
02:29:58,870 --> 02:29:59,930
0-1.

2652
02:30:00,550 --> 02:30:01,370
What does that mean?

2653
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:02,790
Are we looping?

2654
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:04,670
Oh boy, okay.

2655
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:08,110
I saw a face.

2656
02:30:09,490 --> 02:30:11,230
The clock scared me.

2657
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:14,270
Oh, the cat is so cute.

2658
02:30:16,050 --> 02:30:16,650
Okay.

2659
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:22,420
Yeah, is it suddenly PT?

2660
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:23,600
Oh, it's PT!

2661
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:25,600
2.

2662
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:31,480
The rug wasn't messed up before like that.

2663
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:33,520
I can't remember.

2664
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:42,320
6.

2665
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:43,340
No, sorry.

2666
02:30:43,480 --> 02:30:44,000
8-30.

2667
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:47,240
This is my computer time!

2668
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:48,260
No way!

2669
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:51,760
But this is 12.

2670
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:55,480
This was the computer time before too.

2671
02:30:56,460 --> 02:30:57,400
Short-haired Mita.

2672
02:30:58,220 --> 02:30:59,000
Baby Mita.

2673
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:09,010
Okay.

2674
02:31:11,090 --> 02:31:11,690
Okay.

2675
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:17,230
Not quite sure.

2676
02:31:20,730 --> 02:31:23,050
I'm not quite sure what to do.

2677
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:25,070
I guess we'll just keep going for now.

2678
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:43,030
Okay.

2679
02:31:43,690 --> 02:31:44,950
We're on the fourth one.

2680
02:31:45,650 --> 02:31:46,050
Again.

2681
02:31:48,130 --> 02:31:49,030
Thanks for the gift.

2682
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:54,910
Oh no, it's still broken.

2683
02:31:55,090 --> 02:31:55,950
I'll get you a new one, girl.

2684
02:31:55,990 --> 02:31:56,410
Don't worry.

2685
02:31:57,350 --> 02:31:58,010
Ouch, ouch, sorry.

2686
02:31:58,090 --> 02:32:00,450
I can't really turn around, so...

2687
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:07,360
Loop 5.

2688
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,960
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again.

2689
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:24,520
I like watching the light go in the window.

2690
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:25,660
It's kind of cool.

2691
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:28,540
Mita was such a drag.

2692
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:35,600
Every day she'd eat the same kind of food, dress the same, sit in front of the same kind of games.

2693
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:41,200
Again.

2694
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:44,580
Yeah, I like, I like, I like...

2695
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:46,940
You're different.

2696
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,240
Yeah, I'm not like other girls.

2697
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,890
Oh gosh, 7.

2698
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:59,350
7.

2699
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:02,630
Oh, that means scary.

2700
02:33:13,430 --> 02:33:14,210
What's that?

2701
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:16,770
It's here?

2702
02:33:17,410 --> 02:33:18,390
I don't like that.

2703
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:20,090
I'm just gonna go forward.

2704
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:21,450
I'm just gonna go forward.

2705
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:25,050
Whoever raided me, thank you for the raid.

2706
02:33:26,250 --> 02:33:29,380
Oh god, I don't like this, I don't like this.

2707
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:30,980
I've played PT.

2708
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:32,920
I've done my dues.

2709
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:33,960
I've played PT.

2710
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:35,760
I have played PT.

2711
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:36,760
Let me out.

2712
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:37,600
Let me out.

2713
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:39,280
I've done my time.

2714
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:40,880
I've done my time.

2715
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:43,960
Why is my flashlight so weak?

2716
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:45,480
I can't see.

2717
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:50,640
What the?

2718
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:58,960
We're on number 10.

2719
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:00,340
Oh yeah, baby.

2720
02:34:02,860 --> 02:34:03,960
It's raining.

2721
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:06,160
She said that was rare, didn't she?

2722
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:15,470
Weird dog.

2723
02:34:23,730 --> 02:34:25,970
What am I...

2724
02:34:25,970 --> 02:34:27,350
A baseball bat.

2725
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:28,190
I'm grabbing that?

2726
02:34:29,130 --> 02:34:29,590
A weapon?

2727
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:38,320
The umbilical cord.

2728
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:41,560
I'm gonna hit that thing.

2729
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:42,260
A home run.

2730
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:44,240
12.

2731
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:47,650
Hold on, my cat went...

2732
02:34:53,490 --> 02:34:55,830
Pause screen is so freaky.

2733
02:34:56,270 --> 02:34:56,590
Wait.

2734
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:04,320
I might be a genius.

2735
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:10,840
Oh nevermind.

2736
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:13,140
Brightness.

2737
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:15,780
I still can't see anything.

2738
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:17,100
Wait, I can't see anything.

2739
02:35:17,240 --> 02:35:18,000
Oh there is my home.

2740
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:26,640
I can't see anything even with the brightness all the way up.

2741
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:27,600
Oh wait.

2742
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:30,160
I'm a genius.

2743
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:31,300
I'm a genius.

2744
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:34,660
Oh that's the contrast.

2745
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:38,080
I take back what I said.

2746
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:45,540
I can't see anything anymore.

2747
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,140
I give up.

2748
02:35:48,320 --> 02:35:49,780
Anyway, let me let my cat out.

2749
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:52,780
I told you she would want out in like 10 seconds.

2750
02:36:10,820 --> 02:36:11,440
Anyway...

2751
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:11,880
Okay.

2752
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:13,960
Continue.

2753
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:17,220
I kind of don't wish to, but I must.

2754
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,840
Play ball.

2755
02:36:21,140 --> 02:36:25,480
Take me out to the ball game.

2756
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:29,300
Take me out to the crowd.

2757
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:32,480
Buy me some peanuts.

2758
02:36:38,380 --> 02:36:40,140
Cracker Jacks.

2759
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:45,700
I don't care if I ever come back so let's root!

2760
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,880
Root, root for the home team.

2761
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:53,780
If they don't win it's a shame.

2762
02:36:58,290 --> 02:36:59,310
Is it still here?

2763
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:03,930
I don't like that.

2764
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,690
I don't like that.

2765
02:37:04,830 --> 02:37:05,390
I don't like that.

2766
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:07,310
I don't like that.

2767
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:12,770
Let's win!

2768
02:37:13,790 --> 02:37:15,510
There are so many clocks now.

2769
02:37:16,690 --> 02:37:17,770
Only clocks.

2770
02:37:24,090 --> 02:37:26,250
The clocks!

2771
02:37:27,250 --> 02:37:28,030
The clocks!

2772
02:37:28,770 --> 02:37:30,050
What does it mean?

2773
02:37:30,610 --> 02:37:31,430
This one?

2774
02:37:32,470 --> 02:37:33,950
The happy clock.

2775
02:37:38,210 --> 02:37:40,290
I don't get it.

2776
02:37:50,520 --> 02:37:53,620
Is it the one where the little hand is going slow?

2777
02:37:54,060 --> 02:37:55,040
That's like this one.

2778
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:55,960
Maybe I'll just go.

2779
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:56,740
I'm just going to go.

2780
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:00,900
Set the clock's time right.

2781
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:07,660
I guess I did it.

2782
02:38:07,980 --> 02:38:09,560
We can finally see outside.

2783
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,360
Kind of.

2784
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,140
What time is it then?

2785
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:16,880
It's... what?

2786
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:18,920
2...

2787
02:38:18,920 --> 02:38:21,980
2.20... almost 2.25... 2.24?

2788
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:34,820
Unless do I have to find the clock that is my clock?

2789
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:37,520
You know how it was set to my time earlier?

2790
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:40,520
Do I have to find that one?

2791
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:53,200
It's 3.39 for me now.

2792
02:38:59,050 --> 02:39:01,290
Am I overthinking it?

2793
02:39:02,610 --> 02:39:04,710
Am I perhaps overthinking it?

2794
02:39:12,370 --> 02:39:13,290
I almost missed that.

2795
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:37,460
Wait, so it's...

2796
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:44,280
2...

2797
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:50,640
Is that it?

2798
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:50,980
Yeah.

2799
02:39:52,460 --> 02:39:53,020
Release!

2800
02:39:53,500 --> 02:39:55,900
Oh my god.

2801
02:39:56,840 --> 02:39:58,300
I got spooked by a little girl.

2802
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:03,280
Release!

2803
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:10,540
Capture Sakura.

2804
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:13,320
Who are you?

2805
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,840
What's the matter?

2806
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:16,240
Wait, I didn't press any button.

2807
02:40:16,860 --> 02:40:17,820
Can't you speak?

2808
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:18,660
Why are you rude?

2809
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:24,640
Why is MC so rude?

2810
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:25,440
Okay, bye.

2811
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:29,760
Oh, she's gone.

2812
02:40:30,040 --> 02:40:31,140
Or she is on top of me.

2813
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:32,280
She's crawling on my head.

2814
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:33,200
She's crawling on the ceiling.

2815
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:35,880
Run?

2816
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:38,360
Oh, why?

2817
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:39,300
No, no, no.

2818
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:40,000
I don't like that.

2819
02:40:41,020 --> 02:40:42,280
I don't like that at all.

2820
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:44,260
Is there something behind me?

2821
02:40:45,020 --> 02:40:46,300
I don't know.

2822
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:53,880
Usually you're fine in a game until they teach you how to run, you know what I mean?

2823
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:56,360
You're like, oh yeah, horror game.

2824
02:40:56,420 --> 02:40:56,880
Easy peasy.

2825
02:40:57,400 --> 02:40:58,480
I'll save you, little girl.

2826
02:41:01,180 --> 02:41:02,680
How do I save you?

2827
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:03,140
There we go.

2828
02:41:04,720 --> 02:41:05,660
I saved you.

2829
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:08,820
Baby Mita is so cute.

2830
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:13,120
Even if she's got a little glitch, that's okay.

2831
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:17,640
She's got a little bit of a, you know...

2832
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:20,360
A design flaw, but I think that adds character.

2833
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:22,560
I wouldn't even call it a flaw.

2834
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:25,260
It's just, you know...

2835
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:35,650
We need to get back to the previous version.

2836
02:41:35,650 --> 02:41:37,010
Second

2837
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:52,800
friend?

2838
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:54,680
Who's your first friend?

2839
02:42:00,880 --> 02:42:01,880
You're Mita, aren't you?

2840
02:42:01,880 --> 02:42:02,700
Let's

2841
02:42:06,750 --> 02:42:08,870
play together, player.

2842
02:42:09,290 --> 02:42:15,010
If I had the power, we could play together.

2843
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:21,530
I don't know.

2844
02:42:21,850 --> 02:42:25,050
I don't think anything bad happened.

2845
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:31,070
But the good things are decreasing.

2846
02:42:31,710 --> 02:42:32,410
No!

2847
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,070
No!

2848
02:42:47,890 --> 02:42:48,070
No!

2849
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:49,610
No!

2850
02:42:50,710 --> 02:42:51,550
Is

2851
02:42:55,220 --> 02:42:57,200
this your home?

2852
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:57,840
My arms

2853
02:43:01,420 --> 02:43:08,940
are shorter?

2854
02:43:12,890 --> 02:43:14,690
I'm not sure.

2855
02:43:15,050 --> 02:43:17,070
Wait, what that means?

2856
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:29,470
Are we going to encounter a deformed player?

2857
02:43:29,730 --> 02:43:30,350
Oh gosh.

2858
02:43:31,550 --> 02:43:33,150
Become your second friend?

2859
02:43:48,130 --> 02:43:51,950
I'd love to, but I have to go on.

2860
02:44:01,070 --> 02:44:03,430
How do I leave this place?

2861
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:20,640
Bye

2862
02:44:26,810 --> 02:44:27,930
bye!

2863
02:44:32,190 --> 02:44:34,430
I don't

2864
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:38,310
want to leave!

2865
02:44:39,230 --> 02:44:40,630
I'm sorry!

2866
02:44:43,070 --> 02:44:44,790
I think she's going to get mad at me.

2867
02:44:50,830 --> 02:44:51,310
17

2868
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:01,620
I'm back!

2869
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:04,500
I'm back!

2870
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:25,420
I'm not pressing E.

2871
02:45:25,580 --> 02:45:29,100
It forces me to press it.

2872
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:36,540
I don't want to go.

2873
02:45:36,540 --> 02:45:41,900
She looks so sad.

2874
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:44,200
What are those?

2875
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:47,580
I think I gotta go.

2876
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:48,160
I'm so sorry.

2877
02:45:48,540 --> 02:45:48,980
I'm so sorry.

2878
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:50,600
I actually pressed that one this time.

2879
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:53,120
Goodbye!

2880
02:45:57,520 --> 02:45:59,340
I can't run again.

2881
02:45:59,520 --> 02:45:59,940
Oh my god.

2882
02:46:00,680 --> 02:46:01,580
Now I can run!

2883
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:02,620
Now I can run!

2884
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:03,760
Now I can run!

2885
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:08,260
I'm running!

2886
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:12,940
I'm running!

2887
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:14,000
I'm running!

2888
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:15,920
I'm running!

2889
02:46:16,060 --> 02:46:16,220
I'm running!

2890
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:16,520
I'm running!

2891
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:19,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2892
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:20,100
You know.

2893
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:21,940
Just trying!

2894
02:46:23,560 --> 02:46:24,860
That's the deformed player?

2895
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:29,540
Oh gosh!

2896
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:30,540
I'm sorry!

2897
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:31,540
I gotta go!

2898
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:33,700
Oh my god!

2899
02:46:34,480 --> 02:46:36,900
I think I'm getting attacked by the hands.

2900
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:42,800
I want to see him though.

2901
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:45,000
Where is he?

2902
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:52,560
Hold on.

2903
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:00,080
Outside the windows?

2904
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:03,760
Oh!

2905
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:04,800
There we go.

2906
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:13,960
She won't show the vandalism.

2907
02:47:14,180 --> 02:47:15,140
Oh wow!

2908
02:47:15,300 --> 02:47:16,000
We just jumped.

2909
02:47:16,720 --> 02:47:16,860
OK.

2910
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:26,180
Muta...

2911
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:27,540
Hey you!

2912
02:47:28,340 --> 02:47:29,560
Tiny Muta.

2913
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:32,840
Where are we now?

2914
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:35,640
We are back!

2915
02:47:36,160 --> 02:47:36,360
No!

2916
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:44,500
Wait, wait, wait.

2917
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:44,760
Hold on.

2918
02:47:50,950 --> 02:47:52,310
You want to get out?

2919
02:47:53,650 --> 02:47:55,410
Then help me find the key.

2920
02:47:58,350 --> 02:48:00,670
Oh it's just like the original game.

2921
02:48:01,150 --> 02:48:02,610
I think first try in here.

2922
02:48:03,630 --> 02:48:05,210
First try, first try, first try.

2923
02:48:07,510 --> 02:48:08,390
First try.

2924
02:48:10,630 --> 02:48:12,170
Shoot, no key in here.

2925
02:48:41,770 --> 02:48:42,130
This one.

2926
02:48:43,350 --> 02:48:45,810
Come on, just help me find the key already.

2927
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:48,350
OK.

2928
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:51,610
Here!

2929
02:48:54,430 --> 02:48:55,710
She is saucy.

2930
02:48:56,570 --> 02:48:57,610
Found it!

2931
02:48:58,330 --> 02:48:59,990
Oh I noticed she's got short hair.

2932
02:49:00,090 --> 02:49:00,590
So cute.

2933
02:49:02,810 --> 02:49:03,130
OK.

2934
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:08,810
Come.

2935
02:49:08,810 --> 02:49:09,070
Oh.

2936
02:49:10,770 --> 02:49:11,410
Come.

2937
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,280
Pipe.

2938
02:49:17,960 --> 02:49:19,240
Thank you!

2939
02:49:19,720 --> 02:49:21,500
Oh I forgot the voice changer, sorry.

2940
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:23,740
Now, give me that wood.

2941
02:49:24,380 --> 02:49:24,760
Wood.

2942
02:49:26,180 --> 02:49:26,820
Wood.

2943
02:49:26,820 --> 02:49:27,460
Here.

2944
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:31,260
So small but full of spite.

2945
02:49:31,440 --> 02:49:32,140
Just like you Minto.

2946
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:38,680
Wood.

2947
02:49:44,660 --> 02:49:46,280
Some more help please.

2948
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:46,840
Oh my gosh.

2949
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:48,120
What would you do without me?

2950
02:49:48,580 --> 02:49:50,880
This is even your size.

2951
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,500
You are completely capable Minto.

2952
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,000
You are just being lazy now.

2953
02:50:05,950 --> 02:50:07,970
Oh we are making a giant key.

2954
02:50:09,470 --> 02:50:10,270
So beautiful.

2955
02:50:10,470 --> 02:50:11,410
Actually it looks delicious.

2956
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:12,730
I want to eat it.

2957
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:16,150
I want to eat the lava.

2958
02:50:17,910 --> 02:50:18,690
Oh wow.

2959
02:50:19,050 --> 02:50:20,250
Looks like queso.

2960
02:50:21,470 --> 02:50:22,030
Yummy.

2961
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:25,110
Delicious.

2962
02:50:28,410 --> 02:50:28,970
No.

2963
02:50:29,310 --> 02:50:30,410
Forbidden cheese.

2964
02:50:31,050 --> 02:50:32,030
I love lava.

2965
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:33,170
Like actual lava.

2966
02:50:33,330 --> 02:50:35,310
It looks like toasted marshmallow.

2967
02:50:36,690 --> 02:50:39,170
You know, I just want to eat it so bad.

2968
02:50:39,770 --> 02:50:40,250
Oh my gosh.

2969
02:50:40,450 --> 02:50:42,010
The thing almost took out my finger.

2970
02:50:42,790 --> 02:50:43,370
Get ready.

2971
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:44,950
There.

2972
02:50:45,250 --> 02:50:45,630
Take it.

2973
02:50:45,990 --> 02:50:47,110
The key is yours.

2974
02:50:47,110 --> 02:50:49,010
Thank you.

2975
02:50:53,650 --> 02:50:55,070
Why are you helping me?

2976
02:50:55,990 --> 02:50:57,850
What makes you so special?

2977
02:50:58,850 --> 02:51:00,010
Why not help anyway?

2978
02:51:01,370 --> 02:51:01,610
What?

2979
02:51:02,310 --> 02:51:03,530
So foolish.

2980
02:51:04,470 --> 02:51:06,230
You just appeared out of nowhere.

2981
02:51:07,590 --> 02:51:09,550
You are not supposed to be here.

2982
02:51:10,710 --> 02:51:12,210
So I'm helping you.

2983
02:51:13,330 --> 02:51:14,950
She just wants me gone.

2984
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:17,650
Not going to let it cool down.

2985
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:19,470
No, we took cool Mita's gloves.

2986
02:51:20,890 --> 02:51:22,190
Are you Mita?

2987
02:51:23,630 --> 02:51:25,750
I'm TVMita.FBX.

2988
02:51:26,310 --> 02:51:27,150
Tons of lines.

2989
02:51:27,870 --> 02:51:30,130
Simplest models and...

2990
02:51:30,130 --> 02:51:32,430
Best of all, gorgeous hair.

2991
02:51:32,930 --> 02:51:35,470
What are you doing here?

2992
02:51:36,530 --> 02:51:37,530
Don't you get it?

2993
02:51:38,450 --> 02:51:39,890
This is a checkpoint.

2994
02:51:40,610 --> 02:51:41,910
A test of your wits.

2995
02:51:41,910 --> 02:51:43,910
Now come on.

2996
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:47,310
I'm here to guide the hopelessly lost.

2997
02:51:48,770 --> 02:51:49,950
I want her on my desktop.

2998
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:53,450
Have we met before?

2999
02:51:55,410 --> 02:51:56,170
Silly head.

3000
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:57,750
You're kind of cute, you know.

3001
02:51:58,730 --> 02:52:00,770
Asking silly questions like that.

3002
02:52:02,650 --> 02:52:05,590
Though, this is my first time meeting you.

3003
02:52:06,750 --> 02:52:10,410
But listen, if you steal my marvelous look...

3004
02:52:10,410 --> 02:52:12,670
I'll make you regret it.

3005
02:52:13,550 --> 02:52:14,390
OK.

3006
02:52:15,190 --> 02:52:16,390
OK, TVMita.

3007
02:52:17,390 --> 02:52:17,790
Understood.

3008
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:19,770
See you later.

3009
02:52:20,730 --> 02:52:22,190
Stick the key in.

3010
02:52:23,910 --> 02:52:25,590
Kingdom Hearts.

3011
02:52:28,730 --> 02:52:29,770
Bye bye.

3012
02:52:30,030 --> 02:52:30,890
See you later.

3013
02:52:31,490 --> 02:52:32,110
Bye bye.

3014
02:52:33,670 --> 02:52:34,930
Bye bye, silly.

3015
02:52:34,930 --> 02:52:35,070
Silly.

3016
02:52:39,410 --> 02:52:40,410
We went back.

3017
02:52:40,690 --> 02:52:41,070
Aversion.

3018
02:52:42,830 --> 02:52:44,050
Have a look around.

3019
02:52:46,910 --> 02:52:49,570
Can't see much, but I'll have a look around.

3020
02:52:50,550 --> 02:52:51,950
What if I go back in here?

3021
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:55,970
We don't.

3022
02:52:59,410 --> 02:53:01,710
The photos don't have any Mita in them.

3023
02:53:01,710 --> 02:53:05,170
And the books are the same.

3024
02:53:05,910 --> 02:53:06,510
It's a trap.

3025
02:53:07,490 --> 02:53:09,710
And the TV...

3026
02:53:10,490 --> 02:53:11,530
is useless.

3027
02:53:12,630 --> 02:53:15,090
The clock...

3028
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:20,560
I think that's the actual time too.

3029
02:53:22,580 --> 02:53:24,060
That's the shadow.

3030
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:31,280
Are you ugly, Mita?

3031
02:53:35,790 --> 02:53:36,230
Hello?

3032
02:53:36,670 --> 02:53:37,270
Ugly Mita?

3033
02:53:38,230 --> 02:53:39,530
Are you ugly, Mita?

3034
02:53:43,640 --> 02:53:44,720
What is she doing?

3035
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:51,360
It's more like crash dummy Mita.

3036
02:53:52,700 --> 02:53:53,380
Mita?

3037
02:53:54,860 --> 02:53:56,840
I can't see anything.

3038
02:53:58,160 --> 02:53:58,800
Hello?

3039
02:54:01,440 --> 02:54:02,600
Why is it standing?

3040
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:06,940
Yeah, get down.

3041
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:08,740
Stay down.

3042
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:11,340
Why are there multiple...

3043
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:17,740
I don't like this.

3044
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:19,360
Do I have to get to the other side of the room?

3045
02:54:19,920 --> 02:54:21,520
Will I die if they get me?

3046
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:22,300
I'm scared.

3047
02:54:24,680 --> 02:54:27,200
I know, the flashlight is really hard to use.

3048
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:29,480
I'm just gonna go for it.

3049
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:36,960
Cappy.

3050
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:45,060
BTW.

3051
02:54:46,740 --> 02:54:47,640
Sure hand.

3052
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:50,260
The ring opens the right doors.

3053
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:52,500
I honestly don't know how it works.

3054
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:55,880
What's up with this place?

3055
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:57,700
It's super dark.

3056
02:55:01,480 --> 02:55:02,740
Go towards the exit.

3057
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:06,760
Head to the arcade machine.

3058
02:55:07,060 --> 02:55:07,980
Don't be tardy.

3059
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:10,380
Where the hell is the arcade?

3060
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:13,280
Here?

3061
02:55:13,900 --> 02:55:14,440
Here?

3062
02:55:15,900 --> 02:55:16,740
OK, good.

3063
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:18,460
Alright, let's go.

3064
02:55:19,900 --> 02:55:20,800
Tomboy Mita.

3065
02:55:22,420 --> 02:55:26,160
It'll be cool if you can actually customize your Mita to the game, you know?

3066
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:31,780
Suddenly we're jumping through timelines like...

3067
02:55:31,780 --> 02:55:34,340
It feels like Steins Gate all of a sudden.

3068
02:55:35,820 --> 02:55:38,380
Please remove these boxes and get the sofa over here.

3069
02:55:38,380 --> 02:55:39,220
OK.

3070
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:42,200
The world lines.

3071
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:43,240
Exactly, exactly.

3072
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:47,280
I'm here.

3073
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:49,380
Check all the Mita models.

3074
02:55:56,440 --> 02:55:57,800
Scanning requi...

3075
02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:00,340
So, what am I doing here?

3076
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:06,240
I need to get to your screen.

3077
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:07,520
Now.

3078
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:09,200
So.

3079
02:56:09,900 --> 02:56:10,180
What?

3080
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,220
FNAF Mita?

3081
02:56:11,220 --> 02:56:15,720
You need to ensure this prototype is the right one.

3082
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:17,820
First, scan it.

3083
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:23,760
Now check the version in bone skeleton.

3084
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:30,020
OK, so it needs to be V1-274.

3085
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:33,820
Take the prototype Zeta and compare it to the standard version.

3086
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:34,160
Yes!

3087
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:34,940
Paper, please!

3088
02:56:37,140 --> 02:56:38,800
What do I... Oh, here we go.

3089
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:42,120
It's a perfect match.

3090
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:43,560
Now let's check the emotions.

3091
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:45,400
OK.

3092
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:48,020
Sad.

3093
02:56:50,860 --> 02:56:51,380
Blushy.

3094
02:56:51,960 --> 02:56:53,800
The specimen successfully shows emotion.

3095
02:56:54,080 --> 02:56:55,220
Time to test behavior.

3096
02:56:56,320 --> 02:56:56,620
OK.

3097
02:56:56,940 --> 02:56:59,320
Yeah, put your hands in the air like you just don't care.

3098
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:00,320
Now do a spin.

3099
02:57:02,260 --> 02:57:03,300
Now crouch.

3100
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:04,940
Get down on all fours for me.

3101
02:57:04,940 --> 02:57:05,080
Oh.

3102
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:11,460
OK, we've checked everything and it all matches.

3103
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:13,040
Now pull the lever up.

3104
02:57:14,300 --> 02:57:16,160
Ah, OK, so if it's bad, we pull it down.

3105
02:57:16,360 --> 02:57:16,860
Got it, got it.

3106
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:19,020
Now that's the skin on.

3107
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:20,600
Pass her a box of clothes.

3108
02:57:26,510 --> 02:57:27,730
Bye, other Mita.

3109
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:30,770
That's it.

3110
02:57:31,150 --> 02:57:32,250
See those lights on top?

3111
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:34,810
One of them turned green, which means we did it right.

3112
02:57:34,810 --> 02:57:37,290
OK, so scan.

3113
02:57:37,750 --> 02:57:38,710
Oh, your turn.

3114
02:57:38,870 --> 02:57:40,310
I'll be back when all the lights turn green.

3115
02:57:40,530 --> 02:57:41,010
Good luck.

3116
02:57:41,950 --> 02:57:42,890
OK, we're scanning.

3117
02:57:46,250 --> 02:57:46,970
OK.

3118
02:57:47,870 --> 02:57:48,590
OK.

3119
02:57:49,150 --> 02:57:50,010
We're matching.

3120
02:57:51,130 --> 02:57:52,390
Perfect match.

3121
02:57:52,750 --> 02:57:53,790
We're emoting.

3122
02:57:54,910 --> 02:57:55,430
Good.

3123
02:57:56,930 --> 02:57:57,650
Yeah.

3124
02:57:58,170 --> 02:57:58,890
Blushy.

3125
02:57:59,170 --> 02:57:59,930
We're going up.

3126
02:58:01,070 --> 02:58:02,790
We're going around town.

3127
02:58:03,130 --> 02:58:04,710
Why did it just flash like that?

3128
02:58:05,050 --> 02:58:06,050
Why is it taking pictures?

3129
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:07,930
We're going downtown.

3130
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:13,410
Is there anything in here like any secret Easter eggs kind of deal?

3131
02:58:14,310 --> 02:58:15,530
I guess this is OK.

3132
02:58:18,250 --> 02:58:20,830
Why does it take a picture every time there's a spin?

3133
02:58:25,330 --> 02:58:26,170
There you go.

3134
02:58:29,930 --> 02:58:31,130
And green.

3135
02:58:38,070 --> 02:58:39,330
We're scanning.

3136
02:58:48,360 --> 02:58:52,160
Does she know how to properly emote?

3137
02:58:56,300 --> 02:58:58,720
Everything seems fine so far.

3138
02:59:02,360 --> 02:59:03,760
Um...

3139
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:09,780
She seems fine.

3140
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:15,520
Just a little quirky.

3141
02:59:29,510 --> 02:59:30,210
OK.

3142
02:59:31,790 --> 02:59:32,410
Understood.

3143
02:59:33,710 --> 02:59:34,850
Understood.

3144
02:59:35,230 --> 02:59:35,390
OK.

3145
02:59:35,390 --> 02:59:35,510
OK.

3146
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:38,790
Understood.

3147
02:59:39,670 --> 02:59:41,070
143, 143.

3148
02:59:42,730 --> 02:59:43,670
It's a match.

3149
02:59:44,330 --> 02:59:45,250
We're emoting.

3150
02:59:47,410 --> 02:59:48,410
OK.

3151
02:59:48,630 --> 02:59:48,970
Up.

3152
02:59:49,610 --> 02:59:50,370
Around.

3153
02:59:51,350 --> 02:59:52,210
Down.

3154
02:59:52,910 --> 02:59:53,610
And you're good.

3155
02:59:55,310 --> 02:59:56,450
See ya.

3156
02:59:57,270 --> 03:00:00,050
Yeah, we just created another crazy meetup.

3157
03:00:00,530 --> 03:00:01,010
Oh well.

3158
03:00:03,750 --> 03:00:04,270
Alright.

3159
03:00:04,270 --> 03:00:04,790
Normal.

3160
03:00:08,310 --> 03:00:08,830
OK.

3161
03:00:09,610 --> 03:00:11,870
1, 2, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9.

3162
03:00:13,710 --> 03:00:14,670
It's a match.

3163
03:00:15,570 --> 03:00:23,550
Sorry, every time I like drag this over, my mouse goes all the way off the screen so that's why it like starts weird.

3164
03:00:24,610 --> 03:00:25,130
OK.

3165
03:00:25,550 --> 03:00:26,350
We're good.

3166
03:00:26,590 --> 03:00:26,930
Up.

3167
03:00:28,130 --> 03:00:28,650
Around.

3168
03:00:32,110 --> 03:00:33,290
Pew.

3169
03:00:35,770 --> 03:00:38,490
I just killed a robot.

3170
03:00:41,990 --> 03:00:43,170
105.

3171
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:46,110
1.05261.

3172
03:00:50,140 --> 03:00:50,500
OK.

3173
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:51,800
Hearts.

3174
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:52,820
Smile.

3175
03:00:52,980 --> 03:00:53,880
I mean frowns.

3176
03:00:54,380 --> 03:00:55,080
Blushes.

3177
03:00:55,560 --> 03:00:55,860
Up.

3178
03:00:56,800 --> 03:00:57,820
And down.

3179
03:00:58,800 --> 03:00:59,700
And round.

3180
03:01:00,640 --> 03:01:01,600
And round.

3181
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:02,820
OK.

3182
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:04,520
You're good to go baby girl.

3183
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:10,900
Crazy meetup and freaky meetup.

3184
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:12,440
Perfect match.

3185
03:01:13,460 --> 03:01:14,140
You did it!

3186
03:01:14,980 --> 03:01:17,220
Woohoo indeed.

3187
03:01:30,160 --> 03:01:33,980
I made a flesh and bone and you made a skeleton model?

3188
03:01:40,920 --> 03:01:42,140
So cute.

3189
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:45,440
Right, but why do I need to understand that?

3190
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:52,760
For the LOLs!

3191
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:02,360
So what should I do?

3192
03:02:03,500 --> 03:02:07,080
I'll just go wherever a door opens.

3193
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:21,820
But it's like...it's so dark in there.

3194
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:33,140
Why are there other meetas downstairs?

3195
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:39,000
Oh.

3196
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,060
Aw, then why are they danger...wait.

3197
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:48,700
Yeah, they're basically weeping angels, right?

3198
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:51,080
Wait, but you just said that they're the faulty ones.

3199
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:54,300
I feel like I'm going to really hate this part.

3200
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:55,660
Why is it so dark down there?

3201
03:02:57,980 --> 03:02:58,620
Aw.

3202
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:09,700
OK.

3203
03:03:10,480 --> 03:03:11,460
What are you doing here?

3204
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:15,300
Oh, you may encounter faulty ones.

3205
03:03:15,580 --> 03:03:15,840
Got it.

3206
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:21,820
They're like, you're the mom.

3207
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:27,700
Oh my gosh, maybe the stories of the storks is actually true.

3208
03:03:28,180 --> 03:03:31,820
The stork brings the meeta and then...

3209
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:38,160
Mom meeta.

3210
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:39,600
What's this conveyor belt for?

3211
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:45,040
Is there enough room for everyone?

3212
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:56,160
Endless?

3213
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:00,040
What do you mean?

3214
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:06,720
If 1.9 is the latest version, then there are only 19 worlds.

3215
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:13,040
I guess I really don't.

3216
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:20,740
Sure, explain it.

3217
03:04:23,380 --> 03:04:29,120
I just hope this won't be like high school where I always fell asleep out of boredom.

3218
03:04:29,300 --> 03:04:30,740
Damn, we asked.

3219
03:04:33,900 --> 03:04:34,640
OK.

3220
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:38,060
I'm listening.

3221
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:42,500
Yeah.

3222
03:04:53,380 --> 03:04:53,580
Ah.

3223
03:04:58,120 --> 03:04:58,560
Ah.

3224
03:05:00,380 --> 03:05:01,180
Hmm.

3225
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:02,860
Ah.

3226
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:08,720
Ah.

3227
03:05:10,880 --> 03:05:11,020
Ah.

3228
03:05:13,860 --> 03:05:14,560
Heavens.

3229
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:17,140
OK.

3230
03:05:23,380 --> 03:05:25,260
That doesn't make much sense though.

3231
03:05:25,420 --> 03:05:28,380
So if I download version 1.12...

3232
03:05:29,080 --> 03:05:32,260
You're saying if they... The way she's explaining it...

3233
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:39,080
If I download version 1.12, it sounds like I'll never be able to upgrade it to version 1.14, you know what I mean?

3234
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:44,480
Like it sounds like it will always be stuck in this version.

3235
03:05:44,980 --> 03:05:45,500
What?

3236
03:05:45,720 --> 03:05:47,040
That doesn't make any sense.

3237
03:05:53,380 --> 03:05:55,020
No patches or DLC.

3238
03:05:55,620 --> 03:05:56,660
Mitas don't upgrade.

3239
03:05:57,600 --> 03:05:59,840
When you upgrade, you make a new house.

3240
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:03,360
But then I would have to erase my Mita.

3241
03:06:03,880 --> 03:06:04,680
You know?

3242
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:07,980
What's this about?

3243
03:06:09,920 --> 03:06:10,780
Cool Mita!

3244
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,800
Maybe I could help?

3245
03:06:24,480 --> 03:06:25,060
Oh, OK.

3246
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:25,300
Cool.

3247
03:06:27,280 --> 03:06:30,340
Wait, we should stay here for a couple hours and wait for Cool Mita.

3248
03:06:30,720 --> 03:06:32,120
We like her the mostest.

3249
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:34,640
What the hell is this tree?

3250
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:36,820
Is that just a drawing?

3251
03:06:37,260 --> 03:06:39,380
Or does it mean something?

3252
03:06:42,440 --> 03:06:44,700
Oh, I thought it was like the Christmas update.

3253
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:48,380
She doesn't remember though.

3254
03:06:48,980 --> 03:06:50,020
Wait, what do you mean?

3255
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:56,700
She wouldn't remember.

3256
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:57,860
She met me.

3257
03:06:59,540 --> 03:07:01,140
Why is this one so dark?

3258
03:07:05,320 --> 03:07:06,780
Pretty Mita.

3259
03:07:14,780 --> 03:07:16,860
So who won?

3260
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:25,820
Okay.

3261
03:08:03,160 --> 03:08:05,960
The core.

3262
03:08:18,200 --> 03:08:19,800
Sleepy Mita!

3263
03:08:19,800 --> 03:08:20,800
Sleepy Mita!

3264
03:08:23,100 --> 03:08:24,100
I see.

3265
03:08:27,820 --> 03:08:29,800
I want to meet Sleepy Mita!

3266
03:08:34,460 --> 03:08:35,100
Wow.

3267
03:08:35,740 --> 03:08:37,700
I think I might get it.

3268
03:08:39,820 --> 03:08:40,780
What's this?

3269
03:08:41,160 --> 03:08:42,180
Oh, this is Sleepy Mita.

3270
03:08:43,140 --> 03:08:44,560
Why is there a single circle?

3271
03:08:52,220 --> 03:08:54,760
It's the only genuinely unique version.

3272
03:09:02,860 --> 03:09:04,380
I'm also Nemui Mito.

3273
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:05,480
Nemui Minto!

3274
03:09:05,620 --> 03:09:06,360
I just yawned.

3275
03:09:07,460 --> 03:09:10,420
Because she never gets to sleep with everyone passing through her version.

3276
03:09:11,480 --> 03:09:14,340
Oh, that's such like an interesting way to think about it.

3277
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:19,180
It's impossible to wake her up.

3278
03:09:19,820 --> 03:09:21,060
We'll see about that.

3279
03:09:21,480 --> 03:09:23,100
Wait, so she won't talk to us?

3280
03:09:24,140 --> 03:09:26,080
I just get to see her napping?

3281
03:09:26,860 --> 03:09:27,500
What's your version?

3282
03:09:30,080 --> 03:09:31,880
Didn't I meet you in the latest version?

3283
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:35,640
Or perhaps it's just my imagination.

3284
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:41,920
My brain is hurting.

3285
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:43,380
Have you been to it?

3286
03:09:43,720 --> 03:09:44,340
I have.

3287
03:09:45,240 --> 03:09:46,520
That's where I arrived.

3288
03:09:47,480 --> 03:09:49,640
When I was thrown into this world.

3289
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:52,080
Oh yeah, that's right.

3290
03:09:52,160 --> 03:09:53,900
She was a short hair.

3291
03:09:57,360 --> 03:09:59,460
There's a me who just can't stop whining.

3292
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:07,380
There's no end to it.

3293
03:10:07,700 --> 03:10:08,740
Do you remember anything?

3294
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:11,540
It was dark.

3295
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:13,880
There was writing.

3296
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:16,560
Like...

3297
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:17,960
Play with me.

3298
03:10:18,940 --> 03:10:20,220
That's too bad.

3299
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:21,600
It's that girl.

3300
03:10:21,980 --> 03:10:24,520
That forgetful and mean girl.

3301
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:27,260
Oh, cool.

3302
03:10:28,300 --> 03:10:28,600
OK.

3303
03:10:29,620 --> 03:10:32,520
Oh gosh, I don't want to go back into the room.

3304
03:10:32,580 --> 03:10:33,320
I'm scared.

3305
03:10:33,320 --> 03:10:36,680
I'm scared of going back in there.

3306
03:10:36,740 --> 03:10:37,560
I don't want to.

3307
03:10:37,700 --> 03:10:39,240
I wish she would just lead me.

3308
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:44,380
Please, can you just take my hand and lead me through the room?

3309
03:10:44,500 --> 03:10:45,300
I'm scared.

3310
03:10:47,420 --> 03:10:49,420
I don't want to go through this one.

3311
03:10:52,740 --> 03:10:54,260
Ask her to accompany you.

3312
03:10:54,380 --> 03:10:54,800
Will she?

3313
03:10:55,440 --> 03:10:57,360
I don't think I already talked to her.

3314
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:03,720
Please, please, please.

3315
03:11:03,720 --> 03:11:04,480
I'm grabbing your hand.

3316
03:11:04,640 --> 03:11:05,560
Please, please.

3317
03:11:06,120 --> 03:11:07,640
I'm not grabbing anywhere else.

3318
03:11:07,700 --> 03:11:08,280
Just your hand.

3319
03:11:10,040 --> 03:11:15,120
OK, so we have to stare at them and not stop staring at them.

3320
03:11:16,220 --> 03:11:18,480
Oh gosh, I don't want to do this.

3321
03:11:20,660 --> 03:11:21,220
OK.

3322
03:11:22,100 --> 03:11:22,440
Let's go.

3323
03:11:25,960 --> 03:11:26,780
Oh gosh.

3324
03:11:33,260 --> 03:11:34,080
Where did the door go?

3325
03:11:34,300 --> 03:11:34,760
I'm lost.

3326
03:11:36,900 --> 03:11:37,720
I'm lost.

3327
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:39,320
Wait, there is the door.

3328
03:11:40,560 --> 03:11:41,600
This is not the door.

3329
03:11:42,140 --> 03:11:42,680
I'm lost.

3330
03:11:51,720 --> 03:11:52,640
It's cold.

3331
03:11:52,940 --> 03:11:53,900
It's dark.

3332
03:11:54,180 --> 03:11:54,840
Is this the door?

3333
03:11:54,840 --> 03:11:55,100
Oh.

3334
03:12:03,420 --> 03:12:05,980
Should I turn up the brightness some?

3335
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:09,740
I already did, but...

3336
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:11,040
Wait.

3337
03:12:12,220 --> 03:12:13,060
Hold on.

3338
03:12:15,080 --> 03:12:15,720
Graphics.

3339
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:16,960
Brightness.

3340
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:21,280
I'll turn it all the way up for this part.

3341
03:12:22,300 --> 03:12:22,760
Nope, nope.

3342
03:12:22,840 --> 03:12:23,080
Continue.

3343
03:12:23,380 --> 03:12:23,580
OK.

3344
03:12:23,580 --> 03:12:23,660
OK.

3345
03:12:26,800 --> 03:12:28,520
I still can't see anything.

3346
03:12:29,420 --> 03:12:31,220
I thought the door was over here.

3347
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:33,000
Oh, it is.

3348
03:12:33,980 --> 03:12:34,620
I think.

3349
03:12:35,120 --> 03:12:36,080
No, it's not.

3350
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:38,700
Where the hell is the door?

3351
03:12:40,940 --> 03:12:41,840
And then...

3352
03:12:42,920 --> 03:12:44,340
I'm so turned around.

3353
03:12:48,260 --> 03:12:49,800
Where am I?

3354
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:52,360
I wish that they wouldn't... Oh, over here.

3355
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:54,900
I wish he wouldn't...

3356
03:12:57,360 --> 03:12:58,880
put his hand down.

3357
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:00,680
You know what I mean?

3358
03:13:12,290 --> 03:13:13,410
Oh god.

3359
03:13:13,690 --> 03:13:14,750
OK, it begins already?

3360
03:13:16,250 --> 03:13:16,530
OK.

3361
03:13:28,780 --> 03:13:30,240
The bite of 87.

3362
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:35,060
Run!

3363
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:35,880
Oh my god.

3364
03:13:41,130 --> 03:13:41,730
Oh...

3365
03:13:45,390 --> 03:13:48,610
Is it only this one or...

3366
03:13:52,870 --> 03:13:54,210
It's a damn coil head.

3367
03:13:54,610 --> 03:13:55,550
I can't.

3368
03:14:00,460 --> 03:14:01,220
I'm stuck.

3369
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:08,280
What the... Oh my god.

3370
03:14:12,580 --> 03:14:17,240
Where the hell did this one... Oh my god, they look so much like FNAFs.

3371
03:14:17,520 --> 03:14:17,920
You know?

3372
03:14:22,360 --> 03:14:22,780
Himmari!

3373
03:14:31,560 --> 03:14:33,200
Oh my god, they are so scary.

3374
03:14:42,140 --> 03:14:43,720
They are so creepy.

3375
03:14:44,580 --> 03:14:45,680
I saw the door right here.

3376
03:14:47,540 --> 03:14:47,720
Oh.

3377
03:14:47,860 --> 03:14:51,860
Run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run.

3378
03:14:52,220 --> 03:14:53,780
Are there more down... oh my gosh.

3379
03:14:59,480 --> 03:15:01,800
I can still run, that's not a good sign.

3380
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:03,160
Oh my god.

3381
03:15:03,540 --> 03:15:03,860
No!

3382
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:06,340
No!

3383
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:11,020
Don't meet that opening, Sal.

3384
03:15:11,660 --> 03:15:13,820
You were just saying how much you love monsters.

3385
03:15:14,100 --> 03:15:14,420
No!

3386
03:15:14,720 --> 03:15:14,860
No!

3387
03:15:24,700 --> 03:15:27,440
I don't wanna... I wish I had saved.

3388
03:15:28,180 --> 03:15:30,320
Wait, that area is glowing.

3389
03:15:31,240 --> 03:15:32,340
Are they super fast?

3390
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:35,680
Sorry.

3391
03:15:39,770 --> 03:15:40,750
I'm just running.

3392
03:15:41,170 --> 03:15:41,990
I'm running for it.

3393
03:15:46,480 --> 03:15:47,740
Okay, this part's a save.

3394
03:15:47,800 --> 03:15:48,360
Thank goodness.

3395
03:15:50,100 --> 03:15:51,040
There's too many!

3396
03:15:51,440 --> 03:15:53,140
How am I supposed to get past them?

3397
03:15:54,800 --> 03:15:57,160
I hear them just shuffling around.

3398
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:06,640
Maybe if I stay against the wall...

3399
03:16:10,240 --> 03:16:11,660
I can't do this.

3400
03:16:11,740 --> 03:16:12,340
I can't do this.

3401
03:16:12,620 --> 03:16:13,280
I can't!

3402
03:16:18,310 --> 03:16:19,430
Okay, I'm just gonna run.

3403
03:16:28,670 --> 03:16:29,710
Run backwards.

3404
03:16:36,060 --> 03:16:37,840
This part feels impossible.

3405
03:16:46,100 --> 03:16:47,380
360 run.

3406
03:16:49,220 --> 03:16:52,280
Yeah, they are way faster than me.

3407
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:53,760
I saw the staircase though.

3408
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:54,580
I saw it.

3409
03:17:00,080 --> 03:17:01,460
I made

3410
03:17:05,710 --> 03:17:07,290
this my birthday flower twilight!

3411
03:17:07,710 --> 03:17:10,010
Happy birthday to you.

3412
03:17:10,350 --> 03:17:12,370
Happy birthday to you.

3413
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:14,890
Happy birthday flower twilight.

3414
03:17:15,730 --> 03:17:18,170
Happy birthday to you.

3415
03:17:18,930 --> 03:17:19,770
Happy birthday!

3416
03:17:20,830 --> 03:17:23,710
Okay, I think if I go... I have to like...

3417
03:17:23,710 --> 03:17:26,170
Okay, and then I turn like this.

3418
03:17:27,090 --> 03:17:27,830
Oh my god.

3419
03:17:28,610 --> 03:17:29,730
Okay, okay.

3420
03:17:30,230 --> 03:17:31,190
How do I go up?

3421
03:17:33,250 --> 03:17:34,370
Click the ladder please.

3422
03:17:34,590 --> 03:17:35,410
Go up the ladder please.

3423
03:17:36,950 --> 03:17:37,410
Okay.

3424
03:17:40,290 --> 03:17:40,610
Nice!

3425
03:17:45,470 --> 03:17:46,310
What is that?

3426
03:17:46,350 --> 03:17:47,470
Is that the core?

3427
03:17:48,110 --> 03:17:50,010
It feels very core-like, right?

3428
03:17:51,810 --> 03:17:54,670
Do they still move if I... No, doesn't seem like it.

3429
03:17:55,050 --> 03:17:56,410
Okay, we did it!

3430
03:18:06,240 --> 03:18:07,920
I can't run anymore.

3431
03:18:08,160 --> 03:18:08,600
Yippee!

3432
03:18:10,780 --> 03:18:13,980
Chat, the start of the stream is not a horror game.

3433
03:18:14,100 --> 03:18:14,820
Stop it!

3434
03:18:19,140 --> 03:18:19,800
Hmm.

3435
03:18:21,720 --> 03:18:22,380
Okay.

3436
03:18:24,440 --> 03:18:26,480
Is this the core?

3437
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:29,280
Wait, what was that?

3438
03:18:29,480 --> 03:18:31,080
Something showed up in my peripheral.

3439
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:31,540
There.

3440
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:37,680
What is this?

3441
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:39,400
Oh, windows.

3442
03:18:40,980 --> 03:18:41,780
I'm looking around.

3443
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:42,780
I'm looking around.

3444
03:18:45,380 --> 03:18:46,740
I'm looking around.

3445
03:18:46,880 --> 03:18:47,520
I'm looking around.

3446
03:18:48,760 --> 03:18:49,920
The moon.

3447
03:18:53,620 --> 03:18:54,680
It's flat.

3448
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:55,580
Oh, I'm stuck.

3449
03:18:55,860 --> 03:18:56,140
Oh gosh.

3450
03:18:56,360 --> 03:18:57,180
Wait, I'm lost.

3451
03:18:57,340 --> 03:18:58,020
Oh, nevermind.

3452
03:19:00,380 --> 03:19:01,040
Okay.

3453
03:19:07,820 --> 03:19:09,360
The moon is flat.

3454
03:19:11,800 --> 03:19:14,060
This is so Metal Gear.

3455
03:19:14,060 --> 03:19:16,120
Open the passage.

3456
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:18,420
This game is too scary.

3457
03:19:18,500 --> 03:19:19,360
It has women in it.

3458
03:19:24,240 --> 03:19:25,060
I see.

3459
03:19:25,220 --> 03:19:26,180
I see one in there.

3460
03:19:27,400 --> 03:19:28,560
I see one in there.

3461
03:19:29,580 --> 03:19:30,920
What does that mean?

3462
03:19:36,990 --> 03:19:37,470
Hello?

3463
03:19:40,890 --> 03:19:41,610
Is it stuck?

3464
03:19:41,830 --> 03:19:42,530
What does that mean?

3465
03:19:42,790 --> 03:19:43,390
Am I weak?

3466
03:19:43,750 --> 03:19:44,850
What does that mean?

3467
03:19:44,850 --> 03:19:47,230
There is one.

3468
03:19:47,410 --> 03:19:47,830
Hold on.

3469
03:19:47,970 --> 03:19:48,190
Hold on.

3470
03:19:48,310 --> 03:19:49,670
Sorry, I'm going back to photo mode.

3471
03:19:50,410 --> 03:19:50,870
Look,

3472
03:19:55,830 --> 03:19:56,490
you can see him.

3473
03:20:05,630 --> 03:20:08,050
What is the cat meowing for?

3474
03:20:18,420 --> 03:20:19,480
What does this mean?

3475
03:20:24,500 --> 03:20:27,940
I wish I could run a little bit.

3476
03:20:28,940 --> 03:20:30,300
Because I'm so slow.

3477
03:20:44,760 --> 03:20:46,920
What does LOL mean?

3478
03:20:48,220 --> 03:20:49,760
I've never played this game before.

3479
03:20:49,820 --> 03:20:50,480
I don't know what I'm doing.

3480
03:20:54,320 --> 03:20:56,160
Oh, I can click on it.

3481
03:20:59,460 --> 03:20:59,980
Okay.

3482
03:21:02,180 --> 03:21:04,180
I wasn't supposed to know that.

3483
03:21:05,300 --> 03:21:06,080
Let's see.

3484
03:21:10,460 --> 03:21:11,500
Access authorized.

3485
03:21:12,260 --> 03:21:12,880
Okay, there we go.

3486
03:21:18,240 --> 03:21:18,760
Okay.

3487
03:21:23,220 --> 03:21:24,040
The brightness.

3488
03:21:24,240 --> 03:21:25,080
Oh, thank you!

3489
03:21:25,860 --> 03:21:27,060
Yeah, I forgot to change it back.

3490
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:28,200
What was it under?

3491
03:21:28,380 --> 03:21:28,900
Graphics.

3492
03:21:29,720 --> 03:21:33,100
I think I had it at like 3 or something.

3493
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:35,020
There we go.

3494
03:21:35,160 --> 03:21:35,820
That's much better.

3495
03:21:37,580 --> 03:21:40,220
That seems a bit better.

3496
03:21:51,220 --> 03:21:51,780
Hello?

3497
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:53,600
Hello?

3498
03:22:00,910 --> 03:22:02,950
Okay, this is the next one.

3499
03:22:03,890 --> 03:22:05,110
What's over here though?

3500
03:22:05,590 --> 03:22:08,670
I want to see if I can find any more of the tapes.

3501
03:22:08,890 --> 03:22:10,290
Oh, this doesn't look great.

3502
03:22:13,210 --> 03:22:18,470
Oh my gosh, the ambiance in this room is so good.

3503
03:22:20,110 --> 03:22:22,250
Are these patrons or something?

3504
03:22:23,590 --> 03:22:25,510
Is this like a Patreon list?

3505
03:22:28,550 --> 03:22:29,810
Praying for you.

3506
03:22:30,790 --> 03:22:32,010
Oh great Mita.

3507
03:22:40,060 --> 03:22:42,360
Praying for you, oh great Mita.

3508
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:44,540
Praying for you, oh great Mita.

3509
03:22:45,160 --> 03:22:46,600
She doesn't get a lot of people.

3510
03:22:46,820 --> 03:22:47,460
Oh, there's one.

3511
03:22:49,460 --> 03:22:50,380
Spoke too soon.

3512
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:54,980
Press A button.

3513
03:22:56,040 --> 03:22:57,400
Praying for you.

3514
03:22:58,200 --> 03:22:58,960
Um, candle.

3515
03:22:58,960 --> 03:22:59,360
Oh!

3516
03:23:02,860 --> 03:23:05,120
Jump to Discord.

3517
03:23:07,620 --> 03:23:09,600
Is this actual Discord?

3518
03:23:10,140 --> 03:23:10,940
No, thank you.

3519
03:23:13,620 --> 03:23:15,420
Okay, no, no, no.

3520
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:20,560
No, sorry, sorry.

3521
03:23:21,900 --> 03:23:23,420
Sorry, sorry.

3522
03:23:25,300 --> 03:23:27,620
Sorry, sorry.

3523
03:23:28,320 --> 03:23:29,380
No, sorry.

3524
03:23:32,400 --> 03:23:34,100
Praying for you, oh great Mita.

3525
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:36,920
Thank you for the hotdog.

3526
03:23:37,340 --> 03:23:38,680
Thank you.

3527
03:23:39,200 --> 03:23:39,840
That's fun.

3528
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:43,860
I thought there might be like a little cassette tape though.

3529
03:23:46,200 --> 03:23:46,880
Okay.

3530
03:23:52,550 --> 03:23:53,230
Nice.

3531
03:23:54,950 --> 03:23:55,290
Oh.

3532
03:23:56,770 --> 03:23:57,490
Let's see.

3533
03:24:01,930 --> 03:24:02,370
Nice.

3534
03:24:03,730 --> 03:24:04,170
No.

3535
03:24:07,970 --> 03:24:08,870
Oh, no, wait.

3536
03:24:08,970 --> 03:24:09,310
Reset.

3537
03:24:09,630 --> 03:24:10,310
There we go.

3538
03:24:12,850 --> 03:24:13,890
Can these cross?

3539
03:24:14,250 --> 03:24:15,190
Oh, they can't.

3540
03:24:15,290 --> 03:24:15,430
Okay.

3541
03:24:24,210 --> 03:24:25,470
We'll just do it the other way.

3542
03:24:25,990 --> 03:24:27,870
There we go.

3543
03:24:28,870 --> 03:24:30,010
Access authorized.

3544
03:24:30,510 --> 03:24:30,790
Easy.

3545
03:24:31,490 --> 03:24:32,410
This one is a little hard.

3546
03:24:32,670 --> 03:24:33,530
No, it wasn't.

3547
03:24:35,750 --> 03:24:36,330
JK.

3548
03:24:38,170 --> 03:24:39,230
Too easy.

3549
03:24:42,570 --> 03:24:43,170
Yeah,

3550
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:54,560
yeah, the fridge almost killed you.

3551
03:24:55,960 --> 03:24:56,560
Sure,

3552
03:25:00,290 --> 03:25:00,970
I believe you.

3553
03:25:07,510 --> 03:25:08,790
Yeah, I can tell.

3554
03:25:09,470 --> 03:25:14,010
There's fridges everywhere that are just falling from the ceiling, you know.

3555
03:25:14,410 --> 03:25:15,330
It's kind of craziness.

3556
03:25:18,830 --> 03:25:20,410
Yeah, you like watching me?

3557
03:25:22,690 --> 03:25:23,590
Good night!

3558
03:25:35,100 --> 03:25:35,780
No.

3559
03:25:36,640 --> 03:25:37,320
Oh!

3560
03:25:46,150 --> 03:25:48,070
Yeah, keep acting crazy, huh?

3561
03:25:48,370 --> 03:25:49,930
I can be crazier than you.

3562
03:25:52,310 --> 03:25:53,470
Not crazy, Mita?

3563
03:25:54,790 --> 03:25:55,690
What was that sound?

3564
03:26:01,490 --> 03:26:02,450
Can I do it again?

3565
03:26:11,100 --> 03:26:11,540
Okay.

3566
03:26:12,020 --> 03:26:12,820
See ya, Mita!

3567
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:13,780
See ya!

3568
03:26:15,280 --> 03:26:16,480
Wish I could run.

3569
03:26:19,240 --> 03:26:23,040
The parts where I don't want to run, the parts I wish I could run.

3570
03:26:25,640 --> 03:26:29,500
Just when it's like, you know, so long of a walk.

3571
03:26:35,580 --> 03:26:37,440
Also, what is that?

3572
03:26:37,740 --> 03:26:39,640
There's another ledge up here.

3573
03:26:44,210 --> 03:26:44,990
What was that?

3574
03:26:46,490 --> 03:26:47,270
What was that?

3575
03:26:52,800 --> 03:26:54,340
Can I see it from here?

3576
03:26:58,980 --> 03:26:59,420
Tentacles.

3577
03:27:03,720 --> 03:27:04,120
Hmm.

3578
03:27:06,240 --> 03:27:07,680
Yuri, welcome to membership.

3579
03:27:07,920 --> 03:27:08,380
Thank you!

3580
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:13,880
Oh yeah, we could do the photo mode, right?

3581
03:27:14,480 --> 03:27:15,960
So true, that's what I did earlier.

3582
03:27:16,240 --> 03:27:17,540
Hi, Doug!

3583
03:27:17,840 --> 03:27:18,620
Thank you!

3584
03:27:20,960 --> 03:27:23,220
You did say that you wanted one of those Minto fridges.

3585
03:27:23,340 --> 03:27:23,920
So true!

3586
03:27:24,180 --> 03:27:25,120
I did say that!

3587
03:27:25,400 --> 03:27:27,200
Is this what just moved, I wonder?

3588
03:27:27,800 --> 03:27:30,200
But also...

3589
03:27:30,200 --> 03:27:31,560
What are these going to?

3590
03:27:31,560 --> 03:27:33,460
These cables.

3591
03:27:38,400 --> 03:27:38,980
Okay.

3592
03:27:39,620 --> 03:27:40,880
There was this one.

3593
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:42,520
This bridge here.

3594
03:27:43,300 --> 03:27:44,720
Is there a way to get to this one or no?

3595
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:47,000
Doesn't seem like it.

3596
03:27:52,580 --> 03:27:53,160
Okay.

3597
03:27:55,220 --> 03:27:55,980
This way.

3598
03:28:15,930 --> 03:28:17,550
There's like, oh my god.

3599
03:28:18,270 --> 03:28:19,470
Too many of them.

3600
03:28:20,230 --> 03:28:20,570
Anyway.

3601
03:28:21,530 --> 03:28:22,250
Microwave tunnel.

3602
03:28:32,590 --> 03:28:35,630
Take the funicular railway.

3603
03:28:36,210 --> 03:28:37,050
Is that how you say that?

3604
03:28:40,350 --> 03:28:41,650
I'm just chilling.

3605
03:28:41,870 --> 03:28:42,350
Who's there?

3606
03:28:44,490 --> 03:28:45,490
Mito phone?

3607
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:54,070
There was a chibi Mito.

3608
03:28:55,910 --> 03:28:57,470
Guys, I'm already on this.

3609
03:29:07,670 --> 03:29:12,470
You guys remember what I said about not yelling about me doing stuff?

3610
03:29:13,090 --> 03:29:14,890
Please, thank you.

3611
03:29:15,590 --> 03:29:17,830
That's what makes it really hard to play these kinds of games.

3612
03:29:17,950 --> 03:29:21,090
When people are just like, no, Mito, you gotta go do the other thing.

3613
03:29:21,590 --> 03:29:24,450
You should let people experience their own gameplay.

3614
03:29:24,670 --> 03:29:26,230
Even if I miss something, you know.

3615
03:29:26,230 --> 03:29:27,570
Here, I'm looking.

3616
03:29:27,770 --> 03:29:28,450
Where is she?

3617
03:29:29,790 --> 03:29:31,310
Nowhere, I don't see her.

3618
03:29:31,490 --> 03:29:32,650
She's not here.

3619
03:29:45,940 --> 03:29:47,240
She left too slow.

3620
03:29:47,320 --> 03:29:48,940
Yeah, because I didn't know she was there.

3621
03:29:49,740 --> 03:29:53,220
You can't say that I'm too slow when I did not know something existed.

3622
03:29:54,900 --> 03:29:59,500
You can't insult someone for not knowing something when they don't even know what it is.

3623
03:30:00,900 --> 03:30:02,720
Or it's there at all.

3624
03:30:12,780 --> 03:30:15,600
Anyway, I don't even know what they said because now I'm annoyed.

3625
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:19,260
Press the button to get behind the cannon.

3626
03:30:20,060 --> 03:30:21,880
You thought you were just gonna waltz right through.

3627
03:30:22,800 --> 03:30:26,360
You gotta clear this monster slap minigame.

3628
03:30:26,700 --> 03:30:28,040
So get ready to blast.

3629
03:30:29,640 --> 03:30:30,160
Interesting.

3630
03:30:32,620 --> 03:30:33,780
I'm pressing the button.

3631
03:30:35,240 --> 03:30:36,680
Wait, where's my hands?

3632
03:30:37,780 --> 03:30:39,060
What do I look like right now?

3633
03:30:39,760 --> 03:30:41,200
Oh, I can't go into photo mode.

3634
03:30:43,620 --> 03:30:44,900
I'm blasting.

3635
03:30:45,580 --> 03:30:46,440
My hands!

3636
03:30:52,520 --> 03:30:56,460
OK Monster!

3637
03:30:57,600 --> 03:30:58,380
Die monster!

3638
03:31:00,240 --> 03:31:00,920
Die monster!

3639
03:31:02,220 --> 03:31:03,320
Die monster!

3640
03:31:06,040 --> 03:31:07,080
Die monster!

3641
03:31:12,180 --> 03:31:13,680
It's so relaxing though.

3642
03:31:15,180 --> 03:31:16,620
It's so relaxing though.

3643
03:31:16,700 --> 03:31:18,000
The music is so chill.

3644
03:31:18,660 --> 03:31:21,340
And we are just going along and killing these monsters.

3645
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:24,580
It's so chill though.

3646
03:31:29,020 --> 03:31:30,400
I like this part.

3647
03:31:31,620 --> 03:31:33,940
This is so... What if I get really close to one?

3648
03:31:38,280 --> 03:31:38,980
There we go.

3649
03:31:39,640 --> 03:31:41,720
I guess I didn't need to wait, huh?

3650
03:31:47,100 --> 03:31:48,380
There we go.

3651
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:54,400
Thank you.

3652
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:56,340
I did it.

3653
03:31:59,460 --> 03:32:00,100
OK.

3654
03:32:00,100 --> 03:32:01,180
Thank you.

3655
03:32:01,660 --> 03:32:02,080
Bye bye.

3656
03:32:03,840 --> 03:32:04,480
Oh,

3657
03:32:10,140 --> 03:32:10,920
I look the same.

3658
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:12,060
I'm just a little pink.

3659
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:14,920
I look the same.

3660
03:32:16,020 --> 03:32:16,680
Blank.

3661
03:32:17,160 --> 03:32:18,400
Nothingness there.

3662
03:32:18,640 --> 03:32:19,800
Look at them eye bags.

3663
03:32:19,980 --> 03:32:21,900
Oh, we are definitely a salary man.

3664
03:32:22,020 --> 03:32:22,760
So sad.

3665
03:32:25,460 --> 03:32:27,280
Youtuber, why are you not 100%ing?

3666
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:30,060
Bye bye!

3667
03:32:32,960 --> 03:32:33,660
What is this?

3668
03:32:35,760 --> 03:32:36,460
He took?

3669
03:32:37,060 --> 03:32:37,960
He took what?

3670
03:32:40,480 --> 03:32:41,900
Oh, he tore!

3671
03:32:43,340 --> 03:32:44,900
Is this like a doom?

3672
03:32:47,380 --> 03:32:48,380
Is this like a...

3673
03:32:48,380 --> 03:32:50,340
Attention, we must punish the devils.

3674
03:32:50,560 --> 03:32:51,120
You're up, Mita.

3675
03:32:51,340 --> 03:32:53,400
Give them a severe whipping, but be careful.

3676
03:32:53,740 --> 03:32:54,740
They'll fight back.

3677
03:33:00,500 --> 03:33:01,920
Devil girl Mita!

3678
03:33:03,680 --> 03:33:04,740
Is that us?

3679
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:06,260
Hot dog.

3680
03:33:06,960 --> 03:33:08,240
Oh my gosh, it really is doom.

3681
03:33:08,420 --> 03:33:09,300
I just said that.

3682
03:33:09,540 --> 03:33:10,440
I wasn't being serious.

3683
03:33:10,440 --> 03:33:11,340
No way.

3684
03:33:14,540 --> 03:33:17,960
Now we're playing... Oh my gosh, it's like the same doom speed.

3685
03:33:20,500 --> 03:33:23,380
Oh, there's so many of them.

3686
03:33:23,760 --> 03:33:25,040
Do they just non-stop spawning?

3687
03:33:31,980 --> 03:33:33,960
No, it seems like they stop spawning eventually.

3688
03:33:34,900 --> 03:33:35,320
Probably.

3689
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:41,780
We're sniping them.

3690
03:33:47,260 --> 03:33:48,360
Oh gosh, I'm dead.

3691
03:33:48,460 --> 03:33:48,720
I'm dying.

3692
03:33:51,500 --> 03:33:51,940
Oh

3693
03:33:55,220 --> 03:33:55,660
god.

3694
03:33:56,080 --> 03:33:56,700
Oh god.

3695
03:33:56,780 --> 03:33:56,980
Oh god.

3696
03:33:57,080 --> 03:33:57,240
Oh god.

3697
03:33:58,460 --> 03:34:00,360
Oh my god, they're throwing balls at me.

3698
03:34:04,430 --> 03:34:05,930
Oh my god, it's too much.

3699
03:34:06,050 --> 03:34:06,490
It's too much.

3700
03:34:06,930 --> 03:34:07,430
I'm scared.

3701
03:34:10,690 --> 03:34:11,450
I'm scared.

3702
03:34:11,830 --> 03:34:12,590
Oh, there's health.

3703
03:34:13,910 --> 03:34:14,190
Yes.

3704
03:34:16,870 --> 03:34:17,630
I'm scared.

3705
03:34:18,030 --> 03:34:20,590
I'm scared of Mita doom.

3706
03:34:20,590 --> 03:34:22,390
I'm scared of Mita doom.

3707
03:34:24,310 --> 03:34:26,070
Ok, I'm gonna go this way.

3708
03:34:27,950 --> 03:34:29,190
Wait, what the heck is this?

3709
03:34:29,590 --> 03:34:32,170
How do

3710
03:34:36,510 --> 03:34:37,310
I beat the level?

3711
03:34:37,750 --> 03:34:38,910
Do I just kill the guys?

3712
03:34:40,670 --> 03:34:42,170
Oh my god, they're gonna start shooting at me.

3713
03:34:43,090 --> 03:34:44,030
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

3714
03:34:44,410 --> 03:34:45,210
I shoot too.

3715
03:34:45,570 --> 03:34:46,850
I shoot before you guys.

3716
03:34:47,410 --> 03:34:47,750
Oh god.

3717
03:34:50,130 --> 03:34:50,710
Blebleblebleblebleblblbl.

3718
03:34:53,210 --> 03:34:54,370
I'm shooting.

3719
03:34:54,530 --> 03:34:54,810
I'm shooting.

3720
03:34:56,150 --> 03:34:57,470
Where are the...hey!

3721
03:34:57,990 --> 03:34:58,590
Chill out!

3722
03:35:00,850 --> 03:35:02,190
I need more health.

3723
03:35:02,850 --> 03:35:04,270
Noo, I didn't drop any.

3724
03:35:05,410 --> 03:35:06,950
I'm just chillin' there.

3725
03:35:07,450 --> 03:35:08,590
Don't run away!

3726
03:35:11,050 --> 03:35:12,330
I was too...oh my god!

3727
03:35:13,490 --> 03:35:15,130
Oh he gave me health, nice.

3728
03:35:16,690 --> 03:35:18,010
Okay, I'm going forward.

3729
03:35:18,670 --> 03:35:19,570
I'm gonna be brave.

3730
03:35:20,350 --> 03:35:21,510
Oh, nevermind.

3731
03:35:22,210 --> 03:35:23,810
Is there anywhere else I can go?

3732
03:35:24,270 --> 03:35:24,550
Hello?

3733
03:35:25,110 --> 03:35:26,510
Why is this the only room?

3734
03:35:39,970 --> 03:35:41,270
17 out of 20.

3735
03:35:42,650 --> 03:35:42,990
Hello?

3736
03:35:47,800 --> 03:35:48,380
Hello?

3737
03:35:50,460 --> 03:35:51,040
Cave?

3738
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:52,660
Are they inside?

3739
03:35:52,760 --> 03:35:53,400
Did they run away?

3740
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:58,360
Oh my goodness.

3741
03:36:00,620 --> 03:36:02,200
Hell of a win.

3742
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:03,980
I'm not here.

3743
03:36:06,320 --> 03:36:08,040
Wow, 53 headshots.

3744
03:36:09,240 --> 03:36:10,040
Press any button.

3745
03:36:11,600 --> 03:36:11,980
Wow.

3746
03:36:14,520 --> 03:36:15,740
Good at the game.

3747
03:36:16,600 --> 03:36:17,740
That was fun.

3748
03:36:18,520 --> 03:36:19,160
A little stressful.

3749
03:36:20,520 --> 03:36:24,920
I feel like a turtle now after playing that.

3750
03:36:24,920 --> 03:36:28,580
Holy moly, I'm moving at like a little snail's pace.

3751
03:36:29,560 --> 03:36:31,220
That's some fancy shooting.

3752
03:36:33,580 --> 03:36:35,520
Are we in the room now?

3753
03:36:36,180 --> 03:36:36,300
Yes.

3754
03:36:44,390 --> 03:36:45,010
Yeah.

3755
03:36:48,250 --> 03:36:50,550
What on earth is going on here?

3756
03:36:57,900 --> 03:36:58,800
Oh no.

3757
03:36:59,080 --> 03:37:01,540
Find the pieces and assemble the picture on the table.

3758
03:37:02,700 --> 03:37:03,260
Shadow...

3759
03:37:03,920 --> 03:37:06,300
Okay, we don't want to touch Shadow Mita.

3760
03:37:06,940 --> 03:37:09,400
We don't want her to notice where we are.

3761
03:37:10,720 --> 03:37:11,160
Okay.

3762
03:37:11,920 --> 03:37:13,340
Shadow Mita, got it.

3763
03:37:13,780 --> 03:37:15,920
We don't know...

3764
03:37:15,920 --> 03:37:17,260
We don't...

3765
03:37:17,260 --> 03:37:20,220
Got one.

3766
03:37:20,660 --> 03:37:22,720
Oh my god, I still have the chomps on my arm.

3767
03:37:22,720 --> 03:37:23,720
That's kind of crazy.

3768
03:37:26,680 --> 03:37:27,680
Goodness gracious.

3769
03:37:28,480 --> 03:37:28,980
Made me jump.

3770
03:37:29,060 --> 03:37:29,640
Yeah, me too.

3771
03:37:31,000 --> 03:37:32,280
Yeah, use both hands.

3772
03:37:32,360 --> 03:37:32,720
Good idea.

3773
03:37:33,100 --> 03:37:33,500
Good idea.

3774
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:34,780
Okay.

3775
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:40,240
They don't want us to have love.

3776
03:37:41,380 --> 03:37:43,740
They don't want us to find love, Shadow.

3777
03:37:47,890 --> 03:37:49,530
Oh look, there's like a little button.

3778
03:37:50,790 --> 03:37:51,970
File not found.

3779
03:37:53,370 --> 03:37:54,610
Ruin the photos.

3780
03:37:55,250 --> 03:37:57,410
But now, all I feel is regret.

3781
03:38:00,330 --> 03:38:02,550
Oh my gosh, I think we're on a time limit.

3782
03:38:03,050 --> 03:38:03,730
Oh god, okay.

3783
03:38:05,010 --> 03:38:06,250
Sorry, I know she's still talking.

3784
03:38:08,870 --> 03:38:11,130
I wish I could just turn back time.

3785
03:38:16,700 --> 03:38:17,560
Poor girl.

3786
03:38:18,500 --> 03:38:20,520
We're fixing it for you, don't worry.

3787
03:38:20,520 --> 03:38:23,600
Can you... I need to go over there though.

3788
03:38:23,820 --> 03:38:24,500
You need to move.

3789
03:38:31,100 --> 03:38:31,960
Shadow Mita!

3790
03:38:32,420 --> 03:38:34,620
Shadow Mita, I need you to like...

3791
03:38:36,140 --> 03:38:37,900
There we go, nice.

3792
03:38:39,060 --> 03:38:40,040
Open the drawers?

3793
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:42,740
Nothing, okay.

3794
03:38:44,740 --> 03:38:45,300
Alright.

3795
03:38:47,480 --> 03:38:48,840
File not found.

3796
03:38:48,840 --> 03:38:49,700
Cancel.

3797
03:38:51,980 --> 03:38:54,900
This is what I do for all my problems on my computer.

3798
03:38:56,800 --> 03:38:57,080
Okay.

3799
03:39:02,630 --> 03:39:03,770
Find more puzzles.

3800
03:39:03,970 --> 03:39:04,110
Okay.

3801
03:39:05,110 --> 03:39:06,590
It won't let me move them.

3802
03:39:09,670 --> 03:39:10,310
I think.

3803
03:39:10,690 --> 03:39:11,130
Hold on.

3804
03:39:11,130 --> 03:39:12,530
Eh?

3805
03:39:14,710 --> 03:39:15,470
Okay.

3806
03:39:21,570 --> 03:39:23,010
Okay, we're searching.

3807
03:39:23,530 --> 03:39:24,110
Don't worry.

3808
03:39:24,390 --> 03:39:24,930
Oh, in here?

3809
03:39:26,690 --> 03:39:27,610
She has no clothes.

3810
03:39:30,170 --> 03:39:30,930
Nice.

3811
03:39:35,250 --> 03:39:36,690
Oh, whoops.

3812
03:39:36,690 --> 03:39:37,250
Dang it.

3813
03:39:46,390 --> 03:39:47,750
Did I...

3814
03:39:47,750 --> 03:39:49,530
Oh, nevermind.

3815
03:39:49,870 --> 03:39:51,370
Sorry, don't come this way.

3816
03:39:53,390 --> 03:39:54,510
I searched in here.

3817
03:39:55,250 --> 03:39:57,150
I got the...

3818
03:39:57,150 --> 03:39:58,390
Where did I...

3819
03:39:58,390 --> 03:39:58,810
Here?

3820
03:40:03,450 --> 03:40:04,470
You need five.

3821
03:40:04,630 --> 03:40:05,150
It's a bug?

3822
03:40:05,150 --> 03:40:07,150
Wait, half of the people are saying it's a bug.

3823
03:40:07,230 --> 03:40:09,190
Half people are saying it's how it is.

3824
03:40:11,230 --> 03:40:13,170
But I don't see anywhere else that I need to...

3825
03:40:15,430 --> 03:40:16,390
To search for.

3826
03:40:21,670 --> 03:40:22,070
Uh-oh.

3827
03:40:28,170 --> 03:40:29,530
Don't worry, I'll get rid of these for you.

3828
03:40:30,230 --> 03:40:34,350
It's like when I accidentally downloaded something from the link on Neopets, you know?

3829
03:40:35,150 --> 03:40:36,070
Don't worry about it.

3830
03:40:36,550 --> 03:40:37,470
Don't worry about it.

3831
03:40:38,190 --> 03:40:39,270
Don't worry about it.

3832
03:40:44,750 --> 03:40:45,630
File found!

3833
03:40:45,770 --> 03:40:46,090
Cool!

3834
03:40:51,260 --> 03:40:53,280
Alright, now that should be all of them.

3835
03:40:58,240 --> 03:40:58,680
Wait,

3836
03:41:09,960 --> 03:41:11,300
I got one...

3837
03:41:12,160 --> 03:41:12,960
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

3838
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:15,160
I got one...

3839
03:41:15,160 --> 03:41:17,160
Two...

3840
03:41:17,160 --> 03:41:17,960
Three...

3841
03:41:18,520 --> 03:41:19,040
Four.

3842
03:41:19,560 --> 03:41:20,400
Oh, I need one more.

3843
03:41:21,540 --> 03:41:22,320
Where?

3844
03:41:30,060 --> 03:41:32,020
I'm staring, I'm staring.

3845
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:47,640
What do I do?

3846
03:42:05,180 --> 03:42:06,220
Continue.

3847
03:42:13,590 --> 03:42:15,250
I was dragging, you guys.

3848
03:42:15,670 --> 03:42:17,130
I was holding and dragging.

3849
03:42:21,090 --> 03:42:22,950
It's okay, we'll just do this again.

3850
03:42:26,930 --> 03:42:28,630
Well, at least we know where everything is.

3851
03:42:39,980 --> 03:42:40,940
Repeat, repeat...

3852
03:42:40,940 --> 03:42:42,700
Repeat, repeat, repeat...

3853
03:42:42,700 --> 03:42:43,780
Repeat, repeat, repeat...

3854
03:42:43,780 --> 03:42:45,780
Repeat, repeat, repeat...

3855
03:42:45,780 --> 03:42:47,160
Repeat, repeat, repeat...

3856
03:42:47,160 --> 03:42:49,040
We got it.

3857
03:42:55,700 --> 03:42:57,140
Full Saiyan!

3858
03:43:00,180 --> 03:43:00,900
Okay.

3859
03:43:01,800 --> 03:43:02,460
Got it.

3860
03:43:03,300 --> 03:43:04,420
Was anything in here?

3861
03:43:13,750 --> 03:43:15,990
She's right behind me, isn't she?

3862
03:43:20,010 --> 03:43:21,050
Okay, nice.

3863
03:43:21,190 --> 03:43:21,550
And here?

3864
03:43:27,570 --> 03:43:29,290
Now we got four!

3865
03:43:31,430 --> 03:43:33,710
And the last one...

3866
03:43:35,210 --> 03:43:35,830
Five.

3867
03:43:36,490 --> 03:43:36,710
Okay.

3868
03:43:37,350 --> 03:43:37,710
Let's go.

3869
03:43:44,940 --> 03:43:45,820
Two... Uh-oh.

3870
03:43:46,540 --> 03:43:47,240
I'm scared.

3871
03:43:48,240 --> 03:43:48,840
I'm scared!

3872
03:43:49,160 --> 03:43:49,240
Oh!

3873
03:43:49,780 --> 03:43:50,060
Ah!

3874
03:43:50,620 --> 03:43:51,220
There we go!

3875
03:43:51,340 --> 03:43:51,960
Okay, nice.

3876
03:43:56,320 --> 03:43:56,940
One...

3877
03:43:58,140 --> 03:43:58,760
There...

3878
03:43:58,760 --> 03:43:59,860
There... Oh, okay.

3879
03:44:00,000 --> 03:44:01,300
Maybe we should... I thought it was...

3880
03:44:01,300 --> 03:44:02,720
I thought the picture was gonna be bigger.

3881
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:08,060
There and...

3882
03:44:08,060 --> 03:44:08,460
There.

3883
03:44:08,980 --> 03:44:09,780
It's you!

3884
03:44:10,720 --> 03:44:11,800
Oh, how handy.

3885
03:44:12,120 --> 03:44:12,920
Some glue?

3886
03:44:13,680 --> 03:44:14,440
Oh, oh gosh.

3887
03:44:14,540 --> 03:44:14,780
Okay.

3888
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:17,040
Oh, good.

3889
03:44:17,220 --> 03:44:18,040
We're so good at this.

3890
03:44:22,160 --> 03:44:23,120
Just a...

3891
03:44:24,900 --> 03:44:25,800
And perfect.

3892
03:44:25,800 --> 03:44:26,140
Perfect.

3893
03:44:27,740 --> 03:44:28,780
Here you go, Mita.

3894
03:44:32,490 --> 03:44:34,490
I wonder if she hugged me for too long.

3895
03:44:39,430 --> 03:44:41,170
Now she can pass on.

3896
03:44:41,630 --> 03:44:42,450
What's your face?

3897
03:44:50,010 --> 03:44:50,590
Oh...

3898
03:44:54,390 --> 03:44:54,970
Oh...

3899
03:44:54,970 --> 03:44:55,530
Clever.

3900
03:45:01,530 --> 03:45:02,390
Okay.

3901
03:45:06,570 --> 03:45:07,290
The closet.

3902
03:45:08,270 --> 03:45:08,770
I'm looking.

3903
03:45:09,410 --> 03:45:09,570
Oh.

3904
03:45:10,230 --> 03:45:11,030
Is this the trap?

3905
03:45:14,450 --> 03:45:19,190
Oh my god, the school uniform lives!

3906
03:45:19,910 --> 03:45:21,090
Oh shit.

3907
03:45:22,010 --> 03:45:22,770
Thank you.

3908
03:45:22,770 --> 03:45:23,430
Oh, oh.

3909
03:45:24,630 --> 03:45:26,290
I'm running from the Mita models.

3910
03:45:27,230 --> 03:45:28,010
I'm running from them.

3911
03:45:29,290 --> 03:45:29,830
Oh god.

3912
03:45:30,430 --> 03:45:31,290
Oh, I don't like that.

3913
03:45:51,090 --> 03:45:52,370
She's right behind me.

3914
03:45:52,630 --> 03:45:53,610
Oh, she's a cheater!

3915
03:46:01,830 --> 03:46:03,710
It's the same as the other ones.

3916
03:46:03,710 --> 03:46:04,810
I hate these.

3917
03:46:06,310 --> 03:46:07,810
I hate these.

3918
03:46:07,950 --> 03:46:08,790
I hate these.

3919
03:46:08,890 --> 03:46:09,770
I hate these.

3920
03:46:09,890 --> 03:46:11,150
I hate them.

3921
03:46:14,630 --> 03:46:15,110
Wait.

3922
03:46:18,090 --> 03:46:19,710
If I get close...

3923
03:46:28,100 --> 03:46:30,560
Hold on, I'm gonna get a cough drop since I've been screaming.

3924
03:46:33,300 --> 03:46:35,000
Hopefully I don't choke on it though.

3925
03:46:45,340 --> 03:46:47,620
Yeah, do all the Mitas have pointy teeth?

3926
03:46:47,620 --> 03:46:49,080
That's a great point.

3927
03:46:49,960 --> 03:46:50,860
Because if so...

3928
03:46:52,900 --> 03:46:54,260
That's a huge win.

3929
03:46:56,300 --> 03:46:57,980
That is a huge win.

3930
03:46:58,980 --> 03:46:59,240
I

3931
03:47:04,550 --> 03:47:06,290
don't feel like I can just run backwards.

3932
03:47:14,640 --> 03:47:16,520
What if I go this way?

3933
03:47:21,780 --> 03:47:23,740
They're all gathered at the door.

3934
03:47:36,730 --> 03:47:38,210
It's a conga line.

3935
03:47:38,270 --> 03:47:38,750
I know.

3936
03:47:42,790 --> 03:47:44,550
I rejected you earlier.

3937
03:47:44,710 --> 03:47:45,410
I'm sorry.

3938
03:47:45,830 --> 03:47:47,790
I'm sorry if you feel burned.

3939
03:47:51,890 --> 03:47:52,410
But...

3940
03:47:52,410 --> 03:47:55,610
I'm like looking to see if there's any player cartridges.

3941
03:47:55,890 --> 03:47:57,410
Look, there's the pencil in the bottle.

3942
03:47:57,530 --> 03:47:58,950
Oh, my head's blocking it.

3943
03:48:02,450 --> 03:48:03,650
Oh, there's the door.

3944
03:48:23,350 --> 03:48:26,070
Oh, my God.

3945
03:48:26,210 --> 03:48:27,170
I'm so boned.

3946
03:48:27,430 --> 03:48:27,950
Oh, God.

3947
03:48:28,070 --> 03:48:28,530
Oh, God.

3948
03:48:28,610 --> 03:48:29,010
Oh, my God.

3949
03:48:29,090 --> 03:48:29,390
Oh, my God.

3950
03:48:29,450 --> 03:48:29,730
Just run.

3951
03:48:31,950 --> 03:48:32,970
Oh, my God.

3952
03:48:36,930 --> 03:48:37,850
We made it.

3953
03:48:37,890 --> 03:48:38,570
Thank goodness.

3954
03:48:39,050 --> 03:48:40,550
Find a way out with pleasure.

3955
03:48:41,450 --> 03:48:41,850
Sleepy!

3956
03:48:42,390 --> 03:48:43,230
Oh, my gosh.

3957
03:48:43,430 --> 03:48:44,130
We did it.

3958
03:48:44,210 --> 03:48:45,290
We made it to Sleepy.

3959
03:48:45,770 --> 03:48:46,410
Sleepy Mita.

3960
03:48:57,770 --> 03:49:00,990
In every world line.

3961
03:49:03,430 --> 03:49:04,390
Found one.

3962
03:49:07,090 --> 03:49:07,710
Sleepy.

3963
03:49:13,700 --> 03:49:15,040
She just wants to sleep.

3964
03:49:15,580 --> 03:49:16,400
What's on her computer?

3965
03:49:18,680 --> 03:49:19,840
I'll turn the light off for you.

3966
03:49:21,220 --> 03:49:21,640
Mita.

3967
03:49:22,780 --> 03:49:23,900
Mita, wake up.

3968
03:49:23,900 --> 03:49:24,940
Mita, wake up.

3969
03:49:30,540 --> 03:49:30,940
Mita, wake up.

3970
03:49:30,940 --> 03:49:31,560
She's so aggressive.

3971
03:49:31,820 --> 03:49:32,600
Wake up, Mita.

3972
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:33,940
Mita.

3973
03:49:36,940 --> 03:49:38,580
I don't think it's supposed to be an egg.

3974
03:49:38,640 --> 03:49:39,440
I think it's a flower.

3975
03:49:39,940 --> 03:49:41,860
But I think I would like it more if it were an egg.

3976
03:49:43,840 --> 03:49:44,640
Wake up.

3977
03:49:46,840 --> 03:49:48,400
Mita, wake up.

3978
03:49:49,740 --> 03:49:52,180
She's got like a little...

3979
03:49:52,180 --> 03:49:53,700
Oh, I think her...

3980
03:49:53,700 --> 03:49:54,000
No.

3981
03:49:54,520 --> 03:49:57,180
All of them had like a little neck...

3982
03:49:57,180 --> 03:49:58,240
A neck...

3983
03:50:00,380 --> 03:50:00,880
Whatever.

3984
03:50:01,760 --> 03:50:02,260
Ribbon?

3985
03:50:02,600 --> 03:50:04,080
But I think hers is on her wrist.

3986
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:06,340
I mean...

3987
03:50:06,340 --> 03:50:06,660
Ankle.

3988
03:50:07,080 --> 03:50:07,560
That's the word.

3989
03:50:12,060 --> 03:50:13,860
No, it wasn't quite a collar.

3990
03:50:16,220 --> 03:50:16,660
Oh, ducky.

3991
03:50:17,480 --> 03:50:18,540
I'm taking that.

3992
03:50:19,660 --> 03:50:20,580
Throw it at her.

3993
03:50:22,220 --> 03:50:23,880
Her foot wrist, yeah.

3994
03:50:24,780 --> 03:50:27,960
If I try to leave...

3995
03:50:27,960 --> 03:50:29,000
Does it do anything?

3996
03:50:30,220 --> 03:50:31,400
Oh wow, we actually...

3997
03:50:31,400 --> 03:50:32,640
I love this room.

3998
03:50:33,420 --> 03:50:34,960
This is the coolest place.

3999
03:50:36,180 --> 03:50:39,060
What if I play the TV really, really loud?

4000
03:50:45,880 --> 03:50:47,860
What if I leave the front door?

4001
03:50:51,300 --> 03:50:54,020
This is like the first time we could actually do that.

4002
03:50:56,980 --> 03:50:58,080
Pumpkin.

4003
03:50:58,880 --> 03:51:00,400
What are these?

4004
03:51:01,120 --> 03:51:01,860
Oh,

4005
03:51:06,900 --> 03:51:07,020
okay.

4006
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:07,580
There's an order.

4007
03:51:07,780 --> 03:51:07,920
Okay.

4008
03:51:09,060 --> 03:51:09,980
No, no, no.

4009
03:51:10,240 --> 03:51:11,340
One.

4010
03:51:12,080 --> 03:51:12,640
Two.

4011
03:51:14,100 --> 03:51:15,060
Three.

4012
03:51:15,840 --> 03:51:16,140
No.

4013
03:51:16,440 --> 03:51:16,800
One.

4014
03:51:17,780 --> 03:51:18,380
Two.

4015
03:51:20,040 --> 03:51:20,560
Three.

4016
03:51:21,940 --> 03:51:22,620
Four.

4017
03:51:23,160 --> 03:51:24,260
Five.

4018
03:51:27,360 --> 03:51:28,820
New clothes available!

4019
03:51:29,440 --> 03:51:29,880
Yippee!

4020
03:51:34,500 --> 03:51:35,540
That's always fun.

4021
03:51:41,130 --> 03:51:43,150
I love the vibes in this one.

4022
03:51:43,370 --> 03:51:44,890
This house is so pretty.

4023
03:51:46,750 --> 03:51:48,270
I wanna stay in here.

4024
03:51:49,950 --> 03:51:51,470
Is there really no way to wake me up?

4025
03:51:54,610 --> 03:51:56,230
What if I took her pillow from her?

4026
03:52:01,050 --> 03:52:02,690
Can't do anything on her computer.

4027
03:52:05,850 --> 03:52:07,830
We're just total vibes in here.

4028
03:52:08,410 --> 03:52:09,690
Sometimes the lamps flicker.

4029
03:52:09,770 --> 03:52:10,430
It's a little scary.

4030
03:52:14,980 --> 03:52:17,560
I think I would stay with sleepy Mito.

4031
03:52:18,060 --> 03:52:19,660
It might be a little lonely though.

4032
03:52:24,600 --> 03:52:26,660
I can't throw that again at her.

4033
03:52:32,160 --> 03:52:34,080
Put her hand in warm water?

4034
03:52:34,200 --> 03:52:35,100
That's so cruel!

4035
03:52:36,840 --> 03:52:39,700
She'll just pee herself and be asleep in it.

4036
03:52:51,420 --> 03:52:52,840
One more try.

4037
03:52:53,960 --> 03:52:54,580
Wake up!

4038
03:52:57,940 --> 03:52:59,860
No, she didn't even turn over this time.

4039
03:53:00,000 --> 03:53:00,540
Wake up!

4040
03:53:01,140 --> 03:53:01,960
Wake up!

4041
03:53:02,220 --> 03:53:02,880
Wake up.

4042
03:53:16,450 --> 03:53:17,250
I give up.

4043
03:53:19,490 --> 03:53:20,250
I think.

4044
03:53:20,770 --> 03:53:21,710
I think I give up.

4045
03:53:24,710 --> 03:53:26,190
Is there anything else to do in here?

4046
03:53:35,480 --> 03:53:36,420
The picture!

4047
03:53:37,900 --> 03:53:39,380
So cute!

4048
03:53:40,460 --> 03:53:41,740
Oh my gosh.

4049
03:53:42,700 --> 03:53:43,680
Is she crying?

4050
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:46,420
The book titles?

4051
03:53:46,640 --> 03:53:47,660
I think they are the same.

4052
03:53:49,120 --> 03:53:50,140
No, it's a tramp!

4053
03:53:50,680 --> 03:53:51,420
Clever book.

4054
03:53:54,700 --> 03:53:56,980
Is there a light switch?

4055
03:54:00,660 --> 03:54:00,980
No.

4056
03:54:02,420 --> 03:54:02,920
That's okay.

4057
03:54:07,210 --> 03:54:09,070
Back to spooky music.

4058
03:54:10,050 --> 03:54:11,170
Love that.

4059
03:54:13,770 --> 03:54:16,330
I feel like I need her help though.

4060
03:54:17,570 --> 03:54:19,250
It's gotta be... No!

4061
03:54:20,010 --> 03:54:21,910
Try to wake Mito up.

4062
03:54:24,010 --> 03:54:25,710
We need her help.

4063
03:54:28,610 --> 03:54:29,050
Loud!

4064
03:54:29,990 --> 03:54:30,870
Loud TV!

4065
03:54:34,870 --> 03:54:35,950
Oh great, okay.

4066
03:54:36,850 --> 03:54:37,290
Shoot.

4067
03:54:40,690 --> 03:54:43,250
Turn this... Does this scream when it's lit?

4068
03:54:43,510 --> 03:54:44,630
When it's ready for tea?

4069
03:54:56,550 --> 03:54:57,990
I'm not looking at chat.

4070
03:54:58,850 --> 03:55:02,150
I'm gonna try and figure it out myself first.

4071
03:55:03,330 --> 03:55:05,090
I'm gonna try and figure it out myself.

4072
03:55:05,170 --> 03:55:07,150
I'm not... You guys are all saying no help.

4073
03:55:07,290 --> 03:55:08,630
But I didn't even ask.

4074
03:55:08,630 --> 03:55:11,910
I didn't even ask for your help.

4075
03:55:40,230 --> 03:55:41,750
The trickiest thing is...

4076
03:55:42,570 --> 03:55:45,810
I haven't seen anything that I can highlight, you know what I mean?

4077
03:55:46,530 --> 03:55:52,030
To even know if I can try to use it to wake her up.

4078
03:56:02,560 --> 03:56:04,040
I'm in your brain!

4079
03:56:04,040 --> 03:56:04,240
I'm in!

4080
03:56:04,720 --> 03:56:05,820
Wake up Mito!

4081
03:56:20,880 --> 03:56:22,800
Super bright filter!

4082
03:56:26,940 --> 03:56:28,020
Brightness 100.

4083
03:56:32,030 --> 03:56:33,950
Maybe if I do turn up the brightness.

4084
03:56:35,550 --> 03:56:36,650
Brightness 100!

4085
03:56:38,590 --> 03:56:41,230
Not so cozy in here anymore, huh?

4086
03:56:42,070 --> 03:56:43,810
Mito, wakey wakey!

4087
03:56:43,970 --> 03:56:45,050
I need your help!

4088
03:56:51,650 --> 03:56:54,150
Help me with the switches!

4089
03:56:58,550 --> 03:57:03,150
Get me a coffee!

4090
03:57:05,310 --> 03:57:07,770
The coffee maker is just over there.

4091
03:57:09,110 --> 03:57:09,830
No way.

4092
03:57:10,370 --> 03:57:10,710
Mito!

4093
03:57:11,390 --> 03:57:11,890
Mito!

4094
03:57:13,250 --> 03:57:16,610
I... I can't believe...

4095
03:57:19,150 --> 03:57:20,270
I'm out here.

4096
03:57:20,950 --> 03:57:23,350
Trying to... I'm like, the game is meta.

4097
03:57:23,810 --> 03:57:26,230
Surely it wants a really bright room.

4098
03:57:27,250 --> 03:57:29,310
And she'll be like, who's waking me up?

4099
03:57:30,650 --> 03:57:32,630
All I have to do is talk to her.

4100
03:57:40,470 --> 03:57:42,390
Fill it up, baby.

4101
03:57:42,970 --> 03:57:43,490
Alright.

4102
03:57:50,990 --> 03:57:53,110
What am I wasting my time on?

4103
03:57:53,230 --> 03:57:55,130
What else are you gonna do, huh?

4104
03:57:55,430 --> 03:57:56,810
You're not gonna be able to get out!

4105
03:57:57,930 --> 03:57:59,910
Those look like baked beans.

4106
03:58:07,150 --> 03:58:09,090
You like beans with your coffee?

4107
03:58:11,430 --> 03:58:13,850
You have three sugars in this tiny cup.

4108
03:58:14,390 --> 03:58:16,750
We're trying to make sure Mito is awake forever.

4109
03:58:18,550 --> 03:58:20,250
Mito is not going back to sleep.

4110
03:58:25,980 --> 03:58:26,540
Alright.

4111
03:58:28,900 --> 03:58:31,860
Give Mito her baked bean coffee.

4112
03:58:37,650 --> 03:58:38,650
There you go.

4113
03:58:39,590 --> 03:58:40,090
Mito.

4114
03:58:41,990 --> 03:58:43,510
Sleepyhead, here's your coffee.

4115
03:58:46,090 --> 03:58:47,390
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

4116
03:58:47,510 --> 03:58:49,670
Oh, she is wearing the ribbon around her neck.

4117
03:58:51,150 --> 03:58:52,610
See, I told you she had one.

4118
03:58:52,610 --> 03:58:56,850
They all have one, but she also has one around her ankle.

4119
03:58:57,810 --> 03:58:59,770
Maybe she's on house arrest.

4120
03:59:05,710 --> 03:59:06,350
Switches.

4121
03:59:09,150 --> 03:59:10,790
Yeah, I should say that.

4122
03:59:16,230 --> 03:59:16,650
True.

4123
03:59:18,330 --> 03:59:18,870
True.

4124
03:59:19,810 --> 03:59:21,290
House arrest, Mito?

4125
03:59:27,570 --> 03:59:29,990
I don't know what to say.

4126
03:59:31,050 --> 03:59:32,410
But I need to keep going.

4127
03:59:33,570 --> 03:59:35,930
Keep following the ring's guidance.

4128
03:59:45,070 --> 03:59:46,450
She's so eepy.

4129
03:59:46,450 --> 03:59:47,930
That's right.

4130
03:59:48,790 --> 03:59:49,870
So can you help me?

4131
03:59:51,070 --> 03:59:51,790
With the switches?

4132
03:59:54,850 --> 03:59:55,990
Okay, let's go.

4133
03:59:57,970 --> 03:59:58,910
No, no, no, no, Mito.

4134
03:59:59,290 --> 04:00:00,530
Mito, come on, Mito.

4135
04:00:01,950 --> 04:00:02,810
Let's go already.

4136
04:00:07,220 --> 04:00:10,260
Yeah, I'm gonna have to get her up every two seconds, huh?

4137
04:00:10,980 --> 04:00:11,280
Okay.

4138
04:00:12,100 --> 04:00:12,620
Let's go.

4139
04:00:12,740 --> 04:00:13,820
Take Mito to the switches.

4140
04:00:13,960 --> 04:00:14,500
Let's go, girl.

4141
04:00:14,980 --> 04:00:15,620
Not to the bed.

4142
04:00:15,840 --> 04:00:16,460
Let's go, come on.

4143
04:00:16,460 --> 04:00:17,540
Come on, Mito.

4144
04:00:18,180 --> 04:00:19,160
Come on.

4145
04:00:20,600 --> 04:00:22,460
She can open it.

4146
04:00:23,200 --> 04:00:23,420
Mito.

4147
04:00:25,760 --> 04:00:26,660
Alright, come on.

4148
04:00:26,920 --> 04:00:27,340
This way.

4149
04:00:28,040 --> 04:00:28,660
This way, Mito.

4150
04:00:29,880 --> 04:00:30,060
Yeah.

4151
04:00:30,840 --> 04:00:31,960
No, Mito!

4152
04:00:33,080 --> 04:00:33,840
Get up.

4153
04:00:35,600 --> 04:00:36,620
Are you that sleepy?

4154
04:00:38,220 --> 04:00:40,320
I mean, I would be too if I lived here.

4155
04:00:40,820 --> 04:00:42,200
So comfy.

4156
04:00:43,720 --> 04:00:44,560
Come on, Mito.

4157
04:00:46,540 --> 04:00:46,980
Yup.

4158
04:00:47,800 --> 04:00:49,940
Did the snake death animation.

4159
04:00:54,550 --> 04:00:55,430
Spooky music.

4160
04:00:57,910 --> 04:01:00,050
Something just spun in the bottom right corner.

4161
04:01:00,190 --> 04:01:01,890
I can't tell if that's a save or not, though.

4162
04:01:01,970 --> 04:01:02,510
What was that?

4163
04:01:02,930 --> 04:01:03,830
She's honk-shoeing.

4164
04:01:04,310 --> 04:01:04,710
Wake up!

4165
04:01:05,050 --> 04:01:05,550
We're here.

4166
04:01:06,150 --> 04:01:06,430
Come on.

4167
04:01:07,170 --> 04:01:08,230
I take the right one.

4168
04:01:09,090 --> 04:01:10,050
You take the left one.

4169
04:01:11,470 --> 04:01:12,710
Or you take this one.

4170
04:01:13,010 --> 04:01:13,530
Yeah, whatever.

4171
04:01:13,530 --> 04:01:13,570
Whatever.

4172
04:01:16,730 --> 04:01:17,350
Okay.

4173
04:01:20,170 --> 04:01:20,770
Mito.

4174
04:01:22,090 --> 04:01:22,450
Let's go.

4175
04:01:30,380 --> 04:01:31,200
Yeah.

4176
04:01:32,120 --> 04:01:33,140
I got it.

4177
04:01:33,200 --> 04:01:34,560
Just keep awake, okay?

4178
04:01:35,320 --> 04:01:35,580
Go.

4179
04:01:40,980 --> 04:01:42,520
I pulled it.

4180
04:01:43,760 --> 04:01:45,160
I pulled it!

4181
04:01:48,000 --> 04:01:49,160
I pulled it.

4182
04:01:55,190 --> 04:01:56,050
Why isn't it pulling?

4183
04:01:57,910 --> 04:01:58,390
Huh?

4184
04:02:03,250 --> 04:02:03,730
No!

4185
04:02:04,090 --> 04:02:04,450
No!

4186
04:02:04,770 --> 04:02:05,170
It's okay.

4187
04:02:05,410 --> 04:02:05,770
I'll do it.

4188
04:02:05,850 --> 04:02:06,190
I'll do it.

4189
04:02:14,860 --> 04:02:15,100
Okay.

4190
04:02:15,480 --> 04:02:16,020
Thanks, Mito.

4191
04:02:16,220 --> 04:02:16,720
Good night.

4192
04:02:20,440 --> 04:02:21,800
Yeah, it is a little bit.

4193
04:02:24,300 --> 04:02:24,900
Is it?

4194
04:02:25,020 --> 04:02:25,160
Oh.

4195
04:02:25,420 --> 04:02:25,600
Oh!

4196
04:02:26,520 --> 04:02:26,960
Thanks.

4197
04:02:28,160 --> 04:02:28,780
Good night.

4198
04:02:29,260 --> 04:02:29,780
Good night.

4199
04:02:29,780 --> 04:02:30,700
Good night.

4200
04:02:30,700 --> 04:02:36,020
Usually all the other Mitas I've been able to talk to...

4201
04:02:36,020 --> 04:02:38,460
Like, ask them about what they're doing.

4202
04:02:38,580 --> 04:02:39,120
What is this?

4203
04:02:45,060 --> 04:02:45,580
Oh.

4204
04:02:45,580 --> 04:02:46,680
Nothing happened?

4205
04:02:47,000 --> 04:02:47,900
Or every... No.

4206
04:02:48,460 --> 04:02:49,700
What's this button doing here?

4207
04:02:55,860 --> 04:02:56,900
The button!

4208
04:02:57,440 --> 04:02:58,300
Mito, the button!

4209
04:02:59,780 --> 04:03:00,960
Mito, what does the button do?

4210
04:03:02,100 --> 04:03:04,900
The Mita parable truly does...

4211
04:03:04,900 --> 04:03:05,320
What the?

4212
04:03:08,780 --> 04:03:12,910
The button was a dragon!

4213
04:03:14,930 --> 04:03:16,150
Oh, what's happening?

4214
04:03:17,310 --> 04:03:18,810
The blinding light...

4215
04:03:18,810 --> 04:03:19,710
Novels!

4216
04:03:20,450 --> 04:03:22,490
The blinding light was hitting my eyes.

4217
04:03:23,090 --> 04:03:23,890
I couldn't move.

4218
04:03:24,090 --> 04:03:25,810
Just waited until my vision cleared.

4219
04:03:26,650 --> 04:03:30,050
Bright summer sunlight poured through the familiar hall's windows.

4220
04:03:30,050 --> 04:03:30,690
Oh!

4221
04:03:31,310 --> 04:03:32,850
We're in a visual novel!

4222
04:03:34,630 --> 04:03:38,250
After a moment, the days faded a little and I finally glanced around.

4223
04:03:39,070 --> 04:03:45,590
But as soon as I shifted in my seat, a sharp pang in my gut made my heart race, practically pounding against my shirt.

4224
04:03:47,550 --> 04:03:48,450
That's me!

4225
04:03:49,250 --> 04:03:51,010
Something was definitely wrong.

4226
04:03:51,410 --> 04:03:52,610
Was I 2D?

4227
04:03:52,870 --> 04:03:54,150
I'm in a 2D version?

4228
04:03:54,150 --> 04:04:03,930
A dizzy, almost suffocating darkness crept into my head and I instinctively pressed my hands into my lap, trying to steady my breath.

4229
04:04:04,770 --> 04:04:07,990
My chest felt tighter, like it was squeezing inward.

4230
04:04:09,910 --> 04:04:10,430
2Dita?

4231
04:04:13,130 --> 04:04:13,650
Wiggles!

4232
04:04:14,030 --> 04:04:14,690
Welcome to membership!

4233
04:04:15,450 --> 04:04:19,990
After a few minutes, my breathing settled and I finally dared to think about what to do next.

4234
04:04:21,090 --> 04:04:22,830
Shit, what do I do now?

4235
04:04:24,510 --> 04:04:29,210
Desperately trying to gather my thoughts, I strained my brain, searching for ideas until one came to me.

4236
04:04:29,930 --> 04:04:31,650
Right, I should get back to 3D!

4237
04:04:32,750 --> 04:04:36,190
Go out of bounds, just like everyone else used to glitch the game.

4238
04:04:36,830 --> 04:04:37,810
I can do that too!

4239
04:04:38,330 --> 04:04:41,650
I decided to go beyond this 2D reality, back into 3D.

4240
04:04:42,230 --> 04:04:45,150
I reached out, trying to push my hand through... into the...

4241
04:04:45,710 --> 04:04:46,510
3D world!

4242
04:04:48,030 --> 04:04:48,830
But nothing.

4243
04:04:49,250 --> 04:04:50,510
Damn, why isn't it working?

4244
04:04:50,510 --> 04:04:52,910
Get off my screen, you freak!

4245
04:04:55,750 --> 04:04:58,890
Get your mad hands off my monitor!

4246
04:05:01,790 --> 04:05:03,770
Oh wait, where's the ring?

4247
04:05:04,110 --> 04:05:05,050
Oh crap.

4248
04:05:08,370 --> 04:05:10,730
I stopped realizing this was pointless.

4249
04:05:11,910 --> 04:05:16,170
The interface was intangible, like it wasn't really there.

4250
04:05:16,970 --> 04:05:19,450
My only choice was to turn back to the living room.

4251
04:05:20,610 --> 04:05:22,950
I'd have to find that ring no matter what.

4252
04:05:25,990 --> 04:05:27,210
2D only please!

4253
04:05:28,350 --> 04:05:29,150
3D PD!

4254
04:05:32,270 --> 04:05:35,890
Somehow I'd lost it, or maybe it was hidden somewhere in this flat dimension.

4255
04:05:36,070 --> 04:05:37,570
Yeah, the flat dimension!

4256
04:05:39,690 --> 04:05:42,850
Then, just as I took a step, a cute girl appeared out of nowhere.

4257
04:05:43,910 --> 04:05:47,350
She flicked her short pigtails and mischievous gleam in her eyes.

4258
04:05:47,350 --> 04:05:48,830
Oh my god, she's so cute!

4259
04:05:50,450 --> 04:05:50,970
Wait...

4260
04:05:50,970 --> 04:05:52,790
She reminds me of something.

4261
04:05:53,550 --> 04:05:55,070
Of someone, some character.

4262
04:05:56,230 --> 04:05:59,610
Watching me from a few steps away, I could feel the excitement rolling off her.

4263
04:06:00,390 --> 04:06:01,470
And it made me uneasy.

4264
04:06:02,610 --> 04:06:04,690
Clearly, she's a devil in disguise.

4265
04:06:05,670 --> 04:06:06,130
I thought.

4266
04:06:06,530 --> 04:06:07,050
I froze.

4267
04:06:07,410 --> 04:06:10,370
Still not used to these teleporting paranormal types.

4268
04:06:12,330 --> 04:06:12,770
Watashi?

4269
04:06:13,590 --> 04:06:16,570
She let out a loud sigh and rolled her eyes.

4270
04:06:17,350 --> 04:06:20,930
That threw me off as I finally decided I'd be the one to start talking.

4271
04:06:21,570 --> 04:06:22,310
M-Mita?

4272
04:06:22,790 --> 04:06:24,730
She narrowed her eyes in a challenge.

4273
04:06:24,910 --> 04:06:26,950
And her voice rang out from all directions.

4274
04:06:28,650 --> 04:06:30,470
Well, who else then?

4275
04:06:32,710 --> 04:06:35,510
Have you seen many other girls like me?

4276
04:06:36,610 --> 04:06:37,810
And with my name?

4277
04:06:38,610 --> 04:06:40,310
She was practically toying with me.

4278
04:06:40,570 --> 04:06:43,390
Acting as if I wronged her somehow or owed her something.

4279
04:06:45,190 --> 04:06:46,810
Tsundere... Tsundere Mita.

4280
04:06:47,810 --> 04:06:49,590
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

4281
04:06:50,530 --> 04:06:53,210
Honestly, I don't want to know who you're poking around with.

4282
04:06:54,570 --> 04:06:55,930
What are you even doing here?

4283
04:06:56,310 --> 04:06:58,230
You can't just barge into here.

4284
04:06:59,330 --> 04:07:00,810
Her voice was louder now.

4285
04:07:01,350 --> 04:07:04,490
And she punctuated her words by shaking her finger at me.

4286
04:07:05,390 --> 04:07:06,310
The ring!

4287
04:07:07,650 --> 04:07:10,210
Balanced on that slender finger was...

4288
04:07:10,210 --> 04:07:10,970
The ring.

4289
04:07:10,970 --> 04:07:13,790
The one that had somehow vanished from my hand.

4290
04:07:14,350 --> 04:07:15,210
My jaw dropped.

4291
04:07:15,750 --> 04:07:19,410
Her eyes sparkled a glint of triumph breaking through her dark lashes.

4292
04:07:20,730 --> 04:07:22,770
Isn't this what you happen to lose here?

4293
04:07:23,450 --> 04:07:27,010
I swallowed hard and tugged at my collar, feeling a knot in my throat.

4294
04:07:27,970 --> 04:07:33,130
Her bold voice combined with her wild intensity sent a chill through me.

4295
04:07:34,450 --> 04:07:35,890
I was sure of it now.

4296
04:07:36,330 --> 04:07:37,690
This wasn't just some girl.

4297
04:07:38,250 --> 04:07:39,730
She was a force of nature.

4298
04:07:39,730 --> 04:07:46,690
I took a deep breath and said, I'd really appreciate it if you could give me the ring and show me the way out.

4299
04:07:47,770 --> 04:07:49,730
So this is your little trinket?

4300
04:07:50,410 --> 04:07:52,170
I was wondering what it was.

4301
04:07:52,930 --> 04:07:54,450
Her voice suddenly softened.

4302
04:07:55,070 --> 04:07:57,170
Turning playful and curious.

4303
04:07:58,770 --> 04:08:00,650
Isn't the flat dimension where you're...

4304
04:08:03,410 --> 04:08:03,970
Chill!

4305
04:08:05,490 --> 04:08:06,210
Calm down!

4306
04:08:09,730 --> 04:08:11,770
I felt like a weight had lifted off my shoulders.

4307
04:08:12,750 --> 04:08:14,910
The storm had passed and now she seemed...

4308
04:08:16,230 --> 04:08:17,670
Almost flirtatious.

4309
04:08:18,350 --> 04:08:22,990
Her demeanor shifted from fierce panther to curious kitten.

4310
04:08:23,530 --> 04:08:25,090
I hate the MC!

4311
04:08:31,530 --> 04:08:33,790
He's like, I've tamed the beast.

4312
04:08:34,230 --> 04:08:35,370
Oh god!

4313
04:08:36,110 --> 04:08:37,450
Stop it, please!

4314
04:08:37,450 --> 04:08:41,950
I blinked but in that instant the two dimensional Mita vanished.

4315
04:08:42,410 --> 04:08:44,030
Leaving only emptiness in her place.

4316
04:08:44,710 --> 04:08:45,150
Hey!

4317
04:08:45,690 --> 04:08:46,850
I shouted irritably.

4318
04:08:47,970 --> 04:08:48,770
To the kitchen!

4319
04:08:49,590 --> 04:08:51,030
I don't want to go to the bedroom yet.

4320
04:08:51,490 --> 04:08:52,870
We don't know each other like that yet.

4321
04:08:53,270 --> 04:08:55,530
There was nothing left to do but track down the local Mita.

4322
04:08:56,190 --> 04:08:59,050
She had the ring and without that artifact, I couldn't change anything.

4323
04:09:00,590 --> 04:09:01,490
I see it!

4324
04:09:01,830 --> 04:09:03,190
I made my way to the kitchen first.

4325
04:09:03,610 --> 04:09:05,530
Nearly barging through the door in my rush.

4326
04:09:05,530 --> 04:09:07,870
The kitchen was even brighter than the last room.

4327
04:09:07,990 --> 04:09:08,970
It really is bright.

4328
04:09:10,270 --> 04:09:12,550
Kitten, please give me back my ring.

4329
04:09:14,730 --> 04:09:17,330
Filled with the familiar smell of fresh carrots.

4330
04:09:17,490 --> 04:09:20,470
God, she really, really likes carrots, huh?

4331
04:09:20,970 --> 04:09:21,990
Yeah, I will click it.

4332
04:09:22,050 --> 04:09:22,410
I will.

4333
04:09:23,710 --> 04:09:24,190
Oh!

4334
04:09:24,490 --> 04:09:27,170
Oh, I thought I had to wait until the text went away.

4335
04:09:27,610 --> 04:09:28,770
No sign of 2D Mita.

4336
04:09:29,510 --> 04:09:31,310
Oh, good thing I clicked it.

4337
04:09:31,330 --> 04:09:31,830
Oh my goodness.

4338
04:09:33,010 --> 04:09:34,990
It was literally the next...

4339
04:09:35,530 --> 04:09:38,250
The next... I'm glad I noticed it then.

4340
04:09:42,620 --> 04:09:45,420
I darted out, dashed into the hall and skillfully...

4341
04:09:45,420 --> 04:09:53,700
I only noticed it because when we transitioned, it like shined for a brief second before the rest of the thing loaded.

4342
04:09:56,060 --> 04:09:59,680
I darted out, dashed into the hall and skillfully navigated around the sofa.

4343
04:10:00,120 --> 04:10:02,960
A bit of an obstacle before stopping at the bedroom door.

4344
04:10:05,520 --> 04:10:06,080
Oh!

4345
04:10:07,140 --> 04:10:09,500
She's... She's doing Namaste Snake.

4346
04:10:13,340 --> 04:10:15,060
She's... She's doing Chikage.

4347
04:10:21,120 --> 04:10:23,660
It creaked loudly as I slammed it open.

4348
04:10:25,500 --> 04:10:32,060
There she was, cross-legged on the bed in the lotus position, as if she'd been waiting for me to finally find her.

4349
04:10:32,440 --> 04:10:35,080
She opened her eyes, looking calmly at the wall for a moment.

4350
04:10:36,660 --> 04:10:40,280
I suddenly hear Rising Hope, Lisa, playing in the background.

4351
04:10:40,920 --> 04:10:44,220
Then, with all the agility of a circus acrobat, she bounded over to me.

4352
04:10:45,000 --> 04:10:45,960
I've got it!

4353
04:10:46,600 --> 04:10:48,300
You want the ring, weirdo?

4354
04:10:48,860 --> 04:10:50,760
Beat me at tic-tac-toe!

4355
04:10:51,220 --> 04:10:54,960
She grinned, panting a bit, tongue sticking out like a dog.

4356
04:10:55,760 --> 04:10:59,500
Her cheeky tone and mischievous smirk were all in full effect.

4357
04:10:59,580 --> 04:11:02,220
Show me the tongue, you stingy game!

4358
04:11:02,880 --> 04:11:03,840
Show me the tongue!

4359
04:11:06,320 --> 04:11:10,280
I gave her shoulders a slight nudge to put some space between us.

4360
04:11:11,500 --> 04:11:12,920
Look, this is really important.

4361
04:11:13,980 --> 04:11:14,700
Just hand it over.

4362
04:11:14,860 --> 04:11:15,920
A lot depends on it.

4363
04:11:17,220 --> 04:11:24,620
I kept my voice steady and matter-of-fact, but I felt almost ridiculous talking to her in such a measured way.

4364
04:11:25,360 --> 04:11:28,080
She seemed reckless, almost to the point of madness.

4365
04:11:31,480 --> 04:11:31,960
Dang.

4366
04:11:33,360 --> 04:11:36,060
And I could feel a strange humor building in the air between us.

4367
04:11:36,600 --> 04:11:38,000
Does photo mode work in this too?

4368
04:11:38,380 --> 04:11:40,200
Literally, that's what I went to check.

4369
04:11:42,940 --> 04:11:44,160
Don't touch me.

4370
04:11:45,800 --> 04:11:47,580
What's so important about this ring anyway?

4371
04:11:48,460 --> 04:11:50,460
Are you some kind of ring-obsessed weirdo?

4372
04:11:50,680 --> 04:11:52,200
You already called me a weirdo, Mida.

4373
04:11:52,300 --> 04:11:53,840
Get another insult.

4374
04:11:54,440 --> 04:11:56,300
Love putting rings on your fingers?

4375
04:11:56,940 --> 04:11:58,840
She shot back, louder than ever.

4376
04:11:58,920 --> 04:12:00,560
Her taunts even pulled back.

4377
04:12:02,360 --> 04:12:03,100
Show me the tongue.

4378
04:12:03,600 --> 04:12:05,580
Me ever since Mint revealed she had a blep.

4379
04:12:06,000 --> 04:12:06,940
What are you talking about?

4380
04:12:07,000 --> 04:12:08,920
I stick out my tongue all the time.

4381
04:12:09,900 --> 04:12:10,900
It's a magic ring.

4382
04:12:11,140 --> 04:12:12,500
What more do I have to explain?

4383
04:12:12,620 --> 04:12:13,520
Just give it back to me.

4384
04:12:14,840 --> 04:12:16,720
You're a real ring fanatic.

4385
04:12:17,380 --> 04:12:18,720
A magic ring?

4386
04:12:20,400 --> 04:12:23,220
She burst out laughing, the sound echoing around us.

4387
04:12:23,220 --> 04:12:28,740
I glanced away, feeling awkward as her laughter grew more... friendly, almost.

4388
04:12:29,540 --> 04:12:30,640
Show us the blep.

4389
04:12:43,220 --> 04:12:44,960
That's how it's done, Mida.

4390
04:12:47,720 --> 04:12:49,140
Come on, you weirdo.

4391
04:12:49,680 --> 04:12:50,960
Let's play tic-tac-toe.

4392
04:12:52,200 --> 04:12:53,260
Don't waste time.

4393
04:12:53,300 --> 04:12:54,180
Oh, we got the CG.

4394
04:12:54,460 --> 04:12:55,740
We got the tic-tac-toe CG.

4395
04:12:56,400 --> 04:12:57,980
Don't waste time making excuses.

4396
04:12:58,580 --> 04:13:01,400
They do love games, I thought to myself.

4397
04:13:01,800 --> 04:13:03,880
We've been thinking to ourselves the whole time.

4398
04:13:05,100 --> 04:13:05,620
Alright, fine.

4399
04:13:06,280 --> 04:13:07,300
Let's do this.

4400
04:13:08,320 --> 04:13:08,900
You can start.

4401
04:13:09,160 --> 04:13:10,280
I'm feeling generous today.

4402
04:13:10,720 --> 04:13:13,600
Oh, I made the first move.

4403
04:13:14,220 --> 04:13:15,580
You gave yourself away.

4404
04:13:15,940 --> 04:13:18,960
I know why you chose the X's and left me with the O's.

4405
04:13:19,440 --> 04:13:20,000
Psychology.

4406
04:13:20,940 --> 04:13:24,800
The X's are all about closure, hiding stuff, holding secrets.

4407
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:25,900
You're nervous.

4408
04:13:25,900 --> 04:13:28,140
And I get it.

4409
04:13:29,420 --> 04:13:33,180
Next to someone as drop-dead gorgeous as me, you'd think you'd just drop dead.

4410
04:13:33,620 --> 04:13:35,420
Or did you think O's were just better for me?

4411
04:13:35,780 --> 04:13:37,780
Psychology says you're trying to insult me.

4412
04:13:38,200 --> 04:13:38,900
Sharp, dude.

4413
04:13:39,160 --> 04:13:40,060
Very sharp.

4414
04:13:43,520 --> 04:13:45,820
Anyway, I thought I made a smart move.

4415
04:13:46,780 --> 04:13:48,000
I like this game.

4416
04:13:48,680 --> 04:13:51,500
Those little crosses, they think they can just take over everywhere.

4417
04:13:51,920 --> 04:13:53,380
But here, I get to ruin them.

4418
04:13:56,220 --> 04:13:57,640
Oh my god, she talks so much.

4419
04:13:57,860 --> 04:13:58,960
It's like I'm some kind of hero.

4420
04:13:59,600 --> 04:13:59,780
What?

4421
04:13:59,980 --> 04:14:01,220
Am I saying something weird?

4422
04:14:01,660 --> 04:14:02,660
You're giving me that look.

4423
04:14:06,100 --> 04:14:09,820
While she kept up her loud commentary, I quietly made my moves.

4424
04:14:10,400 --> 04:14:11,900
I don't think I'm going to win this, you guys.

4425
04:14:14,420 --> 04:14:15,220
It's symbolic.

4426
04:14:15,500 --> 04:14:18,200
Like you're trying to avoid the ring, but it's not working.

4427
04:14:18,560 --> 04:14:19,500
Clever, aren't you?

4428
04:14:20,280 --> 04:14:21,660
You want that ring, don't you?

4429
04:14:21,880 --> 04:14:23,500
Come on, win it from me.

4430
04:14:25,020 --> 04:14:26,500
Guys, I'm not going to win this.

4431
04:14:35,370 --> 04:14:38,570
We played through the game, and with each move, she kept laughing and talking.

4432
04:14:39,030 --> 04:14:42,470
It was clear who would win.

4433
04:14:43,350 --> 04:14:44,110
Neither of us.

4434
04:14:44,210 --> 04:14:47,770
Our game was interrupted by a loud knock on the door.

4435
04:14:49,990 --> 04:14:51,010
The banging grew louder.

4436
04:14:51,130 --> 04:14:52,030
Oh my god, that's loud.

4437
04:14:54,110 --> 04:14:56,830
It hit, feeling like it shook the floor beneath us.

4438
04:14:57,690 --> 04:14:59,890
Finally, the door burst open.

4439
04:15:00,050 --> 04:15:02,330
I was going to say, it's a 3D Mita.

4440
04:15:03,990 --> 04:15:10,110
And I rushed in crazy, and enrushed crazy Mita in her usual larger than life form.

4441
04:15:10,790 --> 04:15:15,630
Stopping in the center of the room, I froze, feeling myself go pale with shock.

4442
04:15:16,570 --> 04:15:18,710
The 2D Mita looked genuinely frightened.

4443
04:15:19,570 --> 04:15:22,470
Crazy Mita shot us both a sharp look and began to speak.

4444
04:15:40,890 --> 04:15:44,930
I grabbed my startled 2D friend's hand and bolted toward the exit.

4445
04:15:45,630 --> 04:15:49,190
The hall twisted oddly, and we sprinted down a long corridor.

4446
04:15:49,610 --> 04:15:52,530
The pounding footsteps behind us were driving us forward.

4447
04:15:53,610 --> 04:15:55,250
I couldn't tell how long I ran.

4448
04:15:55,830 --> 04:15:56,810
The pounding is getting louder.

4449
04:15:56,810 --> 04:16:00,810
My ears began to strain, blocking everything else out.

4450
04:16:01,870 --> 04:16:07,870
I barely noticed that 2D Mita was trying to talk until she suddenly slipped her hand free from mine.

4451
04:16:09,690 --> 04:16:11,070
Hey, calm down, will you?

4452
04:16:11,290 --> 04:16:12,510
No one's chasing us anymore.

4453
04:16:16,650 --> 04:16:21,950
The boldness had drained from her face, leaving her looking a bit sad, almost apologetic.

4454
04:16:23,190 --> 04:16:26,550
She stared at the floor, tracing little circles with her toe.

4455
04:16:26,810 --> 04:16:27,830
Her toes are out!

4456
04:16:29,350 --> 04:16:30,810
Mito, you wanted that ring, right?

4457
04:16:31,790 --> 04:16:35,070
Well, you beat me fair and square, so here, for the CG!

4458
04:16:36,510 --> 04:16:38,350
She slid the ring back onto my hand.

4459
04:16:40,770 --> 04:16:41,830
Well, thanks.

4460
04:16:42,450 --> 04:16:42,950
Shall we?

4461
04:16:44,070 --> 04:16:48,930
She glanced up and smiled, fidgeting a bit with her fingers, and said in an uncertain tone.

4462
04:16:50,010 --> 04:16:50,590
Where to?

4463
04:16:51,590 --> 04:16:53,390
I don't really have anywhere to go.

4464
04:16:53,730 --> 04:16:54,770
Oh no, she's flat!

4465
04:16:54,850 --> 04:16:55,730
She can't go anywhere!

4466
04:16:56,850 --> 04:16:59,090
Thanks for playing, weirdo.

4467
04:16:59,650 --> 04:17:00,590
Come back sometime!

4468
04:17:01,610 --> 04:17:03,050
As she spoke, something strange happened.

4469
04:17:03,710 --> 04:17:06,150
The world around us shifted, folding back into the house.

4470
04:17:07,130 --> 04:17:11,570
2D Mita's dialogue box flickered and started displaying a phrase I couldn't recognize.

4471
04:17:13,010 --> 04:17:13,650
Cakes?

4472
04:17:13,790 --> 04:17:14,990
I can't stand them.

4473
04:17:16,530 --> 04:17:17,170
Carrots.

4474
04:17:20,910 --> 04:17:22,190
My body!

4475
04:17:23,870 --> 04:17:24,450
Come back!

4476
04:17:24,450 --> 04:17:26,890
Oh my gosh, we got nerdy Mito.

4477
04:17:27,950 --> 04:17:28,310
Mito.

4478
04:17:28,630 --> 04:17:28,970
Mita.

4479
04:17:29,470 --> 04:17:31,890
I'm starting to combine our names, oh my god.

4480
04:17:37,970 --> 04:17:38,630
Mita.

4481
04:17:44,990 --> 04:17:46,310
Oh no, Fujio Mita!

4482
04:17:48,330 --> 04:17:50,330
I need the version.

4483
04:17:51,450 --> 04:17:54,790
I have to get back to the old version somehow.

4484
04:17:59,910 --> 04:18:00,510
Very busy.

4485
04:18:02,990 --> 04:18:03,670
Oh, sorry.

4486
04:18:04,650 --> 04:18:05,490
What's that?

4487
04:18:05,730 --> 04:18:06,250
Toys?

4488
04:18:10,590 --> 04:18:11,630
Sorry, okay.

4489
04:18:11,870 --> 04:18:12,210
Anyway.

4490
04:18:17,470 --> 04:18:19,650
Listen, I need to get to the core.

4491
04:18:23,870 --> 04:18:24,570
I'm sorry.

4492
04:18:26,770 --> 04:18:29,270
Reading books destroys...destroying glitches.

4493
04:18:29,630 --> 04:18:31,370
I need to get to the core and stop Mita.

4494
04:18:37,990 --> 04:18:39,630
But you're Mita too.

4495
04:18:41,610 --> 04:18:42,170
Mila?

4496
04:18:47,130 --> 04:18:49,150
Mita there, Mita here.

4497
04:18:50,630 --> 04:18:52,350
So you're Mila.

4498
04:18:54,810 --> 04:18:55,330
Interesting.

4499
04:18:56,390 --> 04:18:58,270
Well, good luck then, Mila.

4500
04:19:03,850 --> 04:19:05,630
Yeah, I will.

4501
04:19:06,250 --> 04:19:07,330
Yeah, why not?

4502
04:19:07,830 --> 04:19:09,510
I can't go into your bathroom?

4503
04:19:10,590 --> 04:19:11,650
Why do you have a toaster?

4504
04:19:12,850 --> 04:19:15,530
I thought that was a hiragana toaster.

4505
04:19:15,530 --> 04:19:16,390
Oh gosh!

4506
04:19:17,270 --> 04:19:18,470
Personal space!

4507
04:19:20,130 --> 04:19:21,370
Mila, geez.

4508
04:19:21,670 --> 04:19:22,730
I'm looking for a cassette.

4509
04:19:25,110 --> 04:19:27,390
Do you have a...is it a floppy disk?

4510
04:19:27,470 --> 04:19:28,850
Oh no, that's always been there, huh?

4511
04:19:30,150 --> 04:19:30,850
I can't use it.

4512
04:19:30,870 --> 04:19:31,670
Okay, anyway.

4513
04:19:34,010 --> 04:19:36,150
Praying for you, oh great Mila.

4514
04:19:39,930 --> 04:19:40,970
The pictures!

4515
04:19:43,170 --> 04:19:44,450
The books are...oh.

4516
04:19:46,530 --> 04:19:47,230
Oh.

4517
04:19:49,330 --> 04:19:50,030
Why?

4518
04:19:53,090 --> 04:19:54,810
She's embarrassed about that one.

4519
04:20:00,190 --> 04:20:00,890
Cat.

4520
04:20:09,590 --> 04:20:10,990
Minigames?

4521
04:20:12,510 --> 04:20:13,110
Minigames?

4522
04:20:15,210 --> 04:20:15,430
What?

4523
04:20:15,710 --> 04:20:16,270
Electronic pet?

4524
04:20:27,050 --> 04:20:29,370
I don't know what I expected.

4525
04:20:29,670 --> 04:20:29,870
Okay.

4526
04:20:30,790 --> 04:20:31,750
Damn it all!

4527
04:20:32,710 --> 04:20:33,990
What is this?

4528
04:20:38,290 --> 04:20:38,890
Wonderland?

4529
04:20:39,190 --> 04:20:40,130
How do I get out?

4530
04:20:40,990 --> 04:20:43,110
There's supposed to be a way out here.

4531
04:20:45,590 --> 04:20:47,790
Well, what version is this?

4532
04:20:48,670 --> 04:20:50,490
I think I'm on the right track.

4533
04:20:51,950 --> 04:20:53,330
Take a look around.

4534
04:20:53,710 --> 04:20:54,190
Okay, what's this?

4535
04:21:06,070 --> 04:21:06,510
Okay.

4536
04:21:06,850 --> 04:21:07,770
To the bathroom!

4537
04:21:08,550 --> 04:21:09,050
To the bathroom!

4538
04:21:09,170 --> 04:21:09,570
To the bathroom!

4539
04:21:09,710 --> 04:21:10,110
To the bathroom!

4540
04:21:10,730 --> 04:21:11,390
To the bathroom!

4541
04:21:11,510 --> 04:21:11,850
To the bathroom!

4542
04:21:11,970 --> 04:21:12,330
To the bathroom!

4543
04:21:15,290 --> 04:21:16,510
Anything else in here?

4544
04:21:17,830 --> 04:21:18,310
Some soap?

4545
04:21:18,710 --> 04:21:20,150
So is this soap real?

4546
04:21:20,770 --> 04:21:22,010
Or just another decoration?

4547
04:21:22,010 --> 04:21:23,570
It seems real.

4548
04:21:23,670 --> 04:21:24,210
Oh my god!

4549
04:21:31,330 --> 04:21:33,070
So the toilet too?

4550
04:21:37,430 --> 04:21:38,490
But you have no reflection.

4551
04:21:38,850 --> 04:21:39,170
Mirror.

4552
04:21:39,770 --> 04:21:40,510
No reflection.

4553
04:21:41,230 --> 04:21:42,650
You look dissatisfied.

4554
04:21:43,530 --> 04:21:44,850
I learned from my fan.

4555
04:21:46,010 --> 04:21:47,590
It's a phenomenon called reflection.

4556
04:21:48,310 --> 04:21:51,250
But I can't recreate it in my version.

4557
04:21:51,970 --> 04:21:54,410
Yeah, MC is just screaming in the bathroom.

4558
04:21:55,290 --> 04:21:56,430
I know we can talk to her.

4559
04:21:59,150 --> 04:22:01,010
It's still light in here?

4560
04:22:02,550 --> 04:22:03,370
Not really.

4561
04:22:04,270 --> 04:22:06,530
It definitely got quieter.

4562
04:22:06,950 --> 04:22:07,510
I mean quieter.

4563
04:22:07,630 --> 04:22:08,050
Darker.

4564
04:22:08,130 --> 04:22:08,890
What's wrong with me?

4565
04:22:08,890 --> 04:22:10,770
It's evening outside.

4566
04:22:11,950 --> 04:22:13,310
I like the evening.

4567
04:22:13,990 --> 04:22:15,010
When will night fall?

4568
04:22:25,530 --> 04:22:27,150
You know what?

4569
04:22:27,510 --> 04:22:29,430
She kind of has like the worst world.

4570
04:22:29,710 --> 04:22:31,150
Well, nobody bothers her.

4571
04:22:33,590 --> 04:22:37,270
Maybe... maybe... maybe... I would be grumpy too though probably.

4572
04:22:37,270 --> 04:22:39,090
What about another name?

4573
04:22:40,030 --> 04:22:40,070
Mira.

4574
04:22:40,830 --> 04:22:43,770
Why not Mika or Misa?

4575
04:22:47,150 --> 04:22:48,530
Your name sucks.

4576
04:22:50,090 --> 04:22:51,250
Is your eyesight bad?

4577
04:22:51,410 --> 04:22:53,270
Why is the MC so...

4578
04:22:54,130 --> 04:22:54,970
Or Minto.

4579
04:22:55,870 --> 04:22:57,090
Why do you need glasses?

4580
04:23:02,090 --> 04:23:03,050
It's style.

4581
04:23:03,050 --> 04:23:03,590
Because I'm perfect.

4582
04:23:05,270 --> 04:23:08,230
Oh, okay, so you just wear them because you...

4583
04:23:11,210 --> 04:23:14,230
You just want to look like a nerd, okay.

4584
04:23:16,490 --> 04:23:18,470
Yeah, he's such an ass, right?

4585
04:23:18,930 --> 04:23:20,610
He's just so like...

4586
04:23:21,890 --> 04:23:22,370
Cute!

4587
04:23:24,530 --> 04:23:25,990
I like the pictures of her.

4588
04:23:26,270 --> 04:23:26,690
What's that?

4589
04:23:27,790 --> 04:23:28,750
Looks like pizza.

4590
04:23:33,050 --> 04:23:34,130
I'm searching!

4591
04:23:37,940 --> 04:23:38,990
What do you want?

4592
04:23:40,780 --> 04:23:41,950
I'm searching!

4593
04:23:42,690 --> 04:23:44,590
I looked down for two seconds.

4594
04:23:45,310 --> 04:23:46,410
I thought that was Minecraft.

4595
04:23:50,420 --> 04:23:53,220
Gosh, she's so judgy.

4596
04:23:53,480 --> 04:23:54,900
I do...

4597
04:23:59,570 --> 04:24:01,100
More books.

4598
04:24:01,460 --> 04:24:01,860
Water.

4599
04:24:03,360 --> 04:24:04,000
Toxic.

4600
04:24:06,400 --> 04:24:07,780
You don't notice that?

4601
04:24:09,200 --> 04:24:09,540
Oh, see?

4602
04:24:09,660 --> 04:24:10,300
Eggy book.

4603
04:24:18,400 --> 04:24:19,040
Rude!

4604
04:24:23,010 --> 04:24:24,450
Clearly she didn't care.

4605
04:24:27,030 --> 04:24:28,630
Okay, I'm gonna go towards...

4606
04:24:29,690 --> 04:24:30,630
Is this yours?

4607
04:24:30,630 --> 04:24:30,670
Of course!

4608
04:24:35,290 --> 04:24:35,770
Okay.

4609
04:24:38,090 --> 04:24:39,950
My ring is shaking for some reason.

4610
04:24:43,550 --> 04:24:44,310
Oh, no.

4611
04:24:44,710 --> 04:24:46,670
It was given to me by one of the Mitas.

4612
04:24:47,510 --> 04:24:48,970
One of the thousands of them.

4613
04:24:49,930 --> 04:24:52,190
The one that might be able to get me out.

4614
04:24:52,190 --> 04:24:53,030
You're going to touch the bug?

4615
04:24:54,730 --> 04:24:58,310
If my house explodes, you'll die too.

4616
04:24:59,550 --> 04:25:01,170
We'll risk it for the biscuit.

4617
04:25:03,250 --> 04:25:04,390
I'm dealing with it?

4618
04:25:04,850 --> 04:25:05,650
Just grab it!

4619
04:25:07,390 --> 04:25:08,670
Or go in it!

4620
04:25:10,690 --> 04:25:12,110
Down, down, down.

4621
04:25:22,140 --> 04:25:23,540
I can't tell...

4622
04:25:24,120 --> 04:25:25,420
Oh my god, that's so loud.

4623
04:25:25,420 --> 04:25:27,020
Do we want to...

4624
04:25:27,020 --> 04:25:28,340
Do we not get hit by that?

4625
04:25:28,400 --> 04:25:29,640
Or do we want it to hit all of them?

4626
04:25:29,720 --> 04:25:30,520
I can't tell.

4627
04:25:30,680 --> 04:25:31,080
Let's see.

4628
04:25:38,850 --> 04:25:39,910
Okay, I guess we...

4629
04:25:44,390 --> 04:25:46,430
I needed to reflect into there.

4630
04:25:46,550 --> 04:25:46,870
Interesting.

4631
04:25:48,210 --> 04:25:48,890
Okay, okay.

4632
04:25:57,920 --> 04:25:58,320
Okay.

4633
04:26:09,590 --> 04:26:11,630
I did it.

4634
04:26:13,370 --> 04:26:13,830
Hello?

4635
04:26:15,250 --> 04:26:16,390
It's eating it.

4636
04:26:17,850 --> 04:26:19,310
I have to use all of them?

4637
04:26:19,390 --> 04:26:20,210
That's so messed up.

4638
04:26:20,250 --> 04:26:22,350
My brain is big enough to only use...

4639
04:26:24,250 --> 04:26:27,390
This game is... I'm big brained enough.

4640
04:26:27,450 --> 04:26:28,690
I only have to use two of them.

4641
04:26:29,290 --> 04:26:30,750
I'm not like... I'm smarter.

4642
04:26:36,160 --> 04:26:36,980
There we go.

4643
04:26:37,920 --> 04:26:38,380
Gosh!

4644
04:26:39,400 --> 04:26:41,620
I'm smarter than the average ghost!

4645
04:26:49,480 --> 04:26:52,760
I'm still trying to find the cassette, but I can't.

4646
04:26:53,060 --> 04:26:54,040
I don't know where it is.

4647
04:26:59,780 --> 04:27:01,460
Oh, I found it.

4648
04:27:02,300 --> 04:27:02,660
Perfect.

4649
04:27:10,540 --> 04:27:12,360
Maybe this works now.

4650
04:27:13,920 --> 04:27:14,480
No.

4651
04:27:15,160 --> 04:27:16,780
Maybe I go talk to Miela.

4652
04:27:22,990 --> 04:27:24,390
Maybe I killed her.

4653
04:27:31,720 --> 04:27:32,280
Sorry!

4654
04:27:33,720 --> 04:27:34,280
Sorry!

4655
04:27:35,060 --> 04:27:36,440
Sorry, the door is locked.

4656
04:27:37,180 --> 04:27:38,560
Sorry, the door...

4657
04:27:39,600 --> 04:27:40,600
The door is locked.

4658
04:27:40,660 --> 04:27:41,240
I can't get out.

4659
04:27:41,760 --> 04:27:42,660
Oh my god.

4660
04:27:42,860 --> 04:27:44,420
The door is locked.

4661
04:27:44,420 --> 04:27:44,560
Locked.

4662
04:27:47,020 --> 04:27:48,200
Photo mode!

4663
04:27:51,100 --> 04:27:53,460
Is she gonna...

4664
04:27:54,000 --> 04:27:55,420
Oh my god!

4665
04:27:56,540 --> 04:27:57,140
Wow.

4666
04:28:21,880 --> 04:28:25,500
It just looks so...

4667
04:28:29,950 --> 04:28:32,030
Oh my god.

4668
04:28:32,150 --> 04:28:33,830
It's just the worst.

4669
04:28:35,750 --> 04:28:36,790
Yeah, baby!

4670
04:28:38,090 --> 04:28:39,050
Belly button!

4671
04:28:41,870 --> 04:28:42,970
Yeah, baby!

4672
04:28:43,270 --> 04:28:45,090
There's no details, so it should be fine.

4673
04:28:46,190 --> 04:28:46,670
Unless...

4674
04:28:46,670 --> 04:28:47,830
Rip the VOD, rip the VOD.

4675
04:28:50,390 --> 04:28:50,870
Anyway...

4676
04:28:52,570 --> 04:28:53,970
I'm taking a shower!

4677
04:28:54,450 --> 04:28:54,950
Okay, bye bye.

4678
04:29:00,330 --> 04:29:02,010
There's no details, it should be fine.

4679
04:29:02,770 --> 04:29:03,410
Barbie doll.

4680
04:29:03,510 --> 04:29:03,750
Yeah!

4681
04:29:04,650 --> 04:29:05,290
You good now?

4682
04:29:11,630 --> 04:29:12,110
Oh!

4683
04:29:15,330 --> 04:29:16,230
Why did you...

4684
04:29:16,230 --> 04:29:17,770
Why did you suddenly barge into the bathroom?

4685
04:29:18,050 --> 04:29:18,690
I could've...

4686
04:29:18,690 --> 04:29:19,470
You could've waited.

4687
04:29:19,990 --> 04:29:20,890
Until I was that way.

4688
04:29:21,130 --> 04:29:21,250
Huh?

4689
04:29:23,530 --> 04:29:24,150
Wait, what?

4690
04:29:27,950 --> 04:29:28,530
Uh oh.

4691
04:29:29,070 --> 04:29:29,450
Wait, what?

4692
04:29:29,630 --> 04:29:30,110
Glitches.

4693
04:29:31,910 --> 04:29:32,530
There are more?

4694
04:29:33,890 --> 04:29:34,510
Wait, huh?

4695
04:29:40,350 --> 04:29:41,150
I kinda...

4696
04:29:41,150 --> 04:29:41,690
Wait...

4697
04:29:41,690 --> 04:29:42,230
I...

4698
04:29:42,230 --> 04:29:44,070
Why did she ask me if I...

4699
04:29:44,070 --> 04:29:46,370
Wait, why did I ask her if she barged in?

4700
04:29:46,490 --> 04:29:46,870
Wait, what?

4701
04:29:49,270 --> 04:29:52,430
Oh, he's asking why she decided to take a shower when there's a stranger...

4702
04:29:52,430 --> 04:29:52,470
Oh!

4703
04:29:53,270 --> 04:29:54,030
Okay, I see.

4704
04:29:55,030 --> 04:29:55,570
Thank you.

4705
04:29:55,730 --> 04:29:56,990
I was very confused.

4706
04:29:58,050 --> 04:29:59,350
I was like...

4707
04:29:59,930 --> 04:30:00,410
Oh!

4708
04:30:02,430 --> 04:30:02,910
Meow.

4709
04:30:07,890 --> 04:30:08,370
Woah!

4710
04:30:09,090 --> 04:30:09,630
Me too bro!

4711
04:30:09,970 --> 04:30:10,210
No!

4712
04:30:10,870 --> 04:30:11,350
Stalks!

4713
04:30:11,950 --> 04:30:12,910
Thank you!

4714
04:30:14,110 --> 04:30:15,030
Thank you for the hug?

4715
04:30:15,110 --> 04:30:15,590
I don't know.

4716
04:30:19,110 --> 04:30:20,010
Wait, this one?

4717
04:30:20,610 --> 04:30:20,970
Oh!

4718
04:30:23,110 --> 04:30:23,850
Oh, okay.

4719
04:30:24,270 --> 04:30:25,690
I was gonna say, this one I don't understand.

4720
04:30:27,310 --> 04:30:28,090
But I do.

4721
04:30:32,240 --> 04:30:32,980
Meow.

4722
04:30:34,120 --> 04:30:34,860
Meow.

4723
04:30:35,240 --> 04:30:35,600
Meow.

4724
04:30:38,600 --> 04:30:39,340
Meow.

4725
04:30:41,900 --> 04:30:44,140
Why is my perfect idol...

4726
04:30:44,140 --> 04:30:44,940
Oh, she's such a ojisan.

4727
04:30:45,320 --> 04:30:46,200
What do you mean?

4728
04:30:47,000 --> 04:30:48,280
That one was way easy.

4729
04:30:55,820 --> 04:30:56,160
Hello?

4730
04:30:57,080 --> 04:30:58,540
Why does she have that anyway?

4731
04:30:59,660 --> 04:31:00,860
And the katana.

4732
04:31:01,920 --> 04:31:03,180
She's such a weeaboo.

4733
04:31:07,290 --> 04:31:07,850
Oh.

4734
04:31:08,250 --> 04:31:08,810
Ma'am?

4735
04:31:09,790 --> 04:31:10,050
Mia?

4736
04:31:11,390 --> 04:31:12,790
What are you doing under there?

4737
04:31:13,730 --> 04:31:14,310
I wanna see.

4738
04:31:14,650 --> 04:31:16,610
I wanna see what she's doing under there.

4739
04:31:19,210 --> 04:31:21,070
She's just chilling with her book.

4740
04:31:22,710 --> 04:31:23,270
Okay.

4741
04:31:36,500 --> 04:31:38,480
Have you seen any more glitches?

4742
04:31:44,460 --> 04:31:46,040
What's your favorite Mita?

4743
04:31:46,200 --> 04:31:46,800
I like Miura.

4744
04:31:47,460 --> 04:31:49,500
I like Cappy so far, I think.

4745
04:31:51,620 --> 04:31:52,520
I'll look for it myself.

4746
04:31:53,280 --> 04:31:53,860
Yeah, what's that?

4747
04:31:54,040 --> 04:31:54,920
What are you gonna ask, Mia?

4748
04:31:58,380 --> 04:31:58,860
Yeah.

4749
04:31:59,640 --> 04:32:00,120
Yes.

4750
04:32:00,880 --> 04:32:01,680
That's right.

4751
04:32:02,780 --> 04:32:04,460
I want to get out of this game.

4752
04:32:09,220 --> 04:32:09,500
Hmm?

4753
04:32:15,960 --> 04:32:18,720
First you're yelling at me, now you're asking me to stay?

4754
04:32:19,900 --> 04:32:20,880
To read books?

4755
04:32:22,800 --> 04:32:23,900
Maybe I would.

4756
04:32:24,260 --> 04:32:25,420
But I have to keep moving.

4757
04:32:29,720 --> 04:32:31,120
I think she's lonely.

4758
04:32:34,860 --> 04:32:36,600
I think she's lonely.

4759
04:32:36,920 --> 04:32:37,860
I think she's lonely.

4760
04:32:39,240 --> 04:32:40,380
I hear one.

4761
04:32:46,560 --> 04:32:47,200
Okay.

4762
04:32:48,060 --> 04:32:49,000
I would...

4763
04:32:49,920 --> 04:32:50,940
She's kinda cute.

4764
04:32:55,000 --> 04:32:58,140
Ah, found it.

4765
04:32:59,140 --> 04:33:00,600
Yeah, I wouldn't...

4766
04:33:00,600 --> 04:33:02,900
It wasn't so loud behind the door.

4767
04:33:05,440 --> 04:33:09,420
Oh, it's so wet.

4768
04:33:13,000 --> 04:33:14,260
Oh, what?

4769
04:33:17,100 --> 04:33:19,980
Am I supposed to match them all?

4770
04:33:23,120 --> 04:33:24,040
I'm assuming.

4771
04:33:24,260 --> 04:33:25,000
Oh, I see.

4772
04:33:25,900 --> 04:33:28,060
Oh, I think I have to match up to their shape.

4773
04:33:28,180 --> 04:33:29,500
Oh, that's kind of annoying.

4774
04:33:30,420 --> 04:33:32,500
Why are all the star ones here then?

4775
04:33:33,140 --> 04:33:33,500
Okay.

4776
04:33:35,680 --> 04:33:36,920
It's a little bit annoying.

4777
04:33:39,640 --> 04:33:41,040
If I just match...

4778
04:33:41,040 --> 04:33:41,880
If I...

4779
04:33:43,420 --> 04:33:44,860
Do like...

4780
04:33:44,860 --> 04:33:46,040
This.

4781
04:33:47,640 --> 04:33:49,220
Ew, they sound so wet.

4782
04:33:51,060 --> 04:33:52,920
Why do they sound so wet?

4783
04:33:55,500 --> 04:33:56,780
There we go.

4784
04:33:57,820 --> 04:33:58,080
Ew.

4785
04:34:01,180 --> 04:34:02,880
Oh, wrong one, wrong one.

4786
04:34:03,240 --> 04:34:03,740
There we go.

4787
04:34:05,660 --> 04:34:06,220
Ew.

4788
04:34:07,460 --> 04:34:07,980
Ew.

4789
04:34:12,140 --> 04:34:12,860
Ew.

4790
04:34:12,860 --> 04:34:12,960
Ew.

4791
04:34:13,380 --> 04:34:15,100
I need to wash my hands now.

4792
04:34:23,390 --> 04:34:24,750
Jack is back.

4793
04:34:33,630 --> 04:34:34,590
I didn't.

4794
04:34:34,770 --> 04:34:35,530
You're being serious?

4795
04:34:39,670 --> 04:34:40,690
Not really.

4796
04:34:40,890 --> 04:34:42,450
I think that wasn't convincing.

4797
04:34:42,670 --> 04:34:43,530
What's wrong with the MC?

4798
04:34:52,290 --> 04:34:52,910
Oh.

4799
04:34:53,570 --> 04:34:54,010
No.

4800
04:34:54,990 --> 04:34:55,810
It's just...

4801
04:34:55,810 --> 04:34:56,950
We're in a game.

4802
04:34:57,970 --> 04:35:01,030
Here, with a snap of your fingers, anything is possible.

4803
04:35:18,790 --> 04:35:20,350
Thanks for the super chat, Nick.

4804
04:35:28,350 --> 04:35:29,510
Oh, there's so much here.

4805
04:35:30,070 --> 04:35:31,670
These pictures are...

4806
04:35:31,670 --> 04:35:32,210
Are they real?

4807
04:35:33,310 --> 04:35:34,070
In other versions?

4808
04:35:35,410 --> 04:35:38,050
Yeah, they exist, but they're almost too intense.

4809
04:35:44,390 --> 04:35:44,790
What?

4810
04:35:45,050 --> 04:35:45,910
What does he mean by that?

4811
04:35:46,690 --> 04:35:47,630
They're drawings.

4812
04:35:48,310 --> 04:35:49,150
That's cute.

4813
04:36:02,270 --> 04:36:04,350
She reverted back to T-pose.

4814
04:36:12,670 --> 04:36:14,730
I think I hear the next one.

4815
04:36:16,030 --> 04:36:17,970
Why do you even read books?

4816
04:36:19,190 --> 04:36:20,530
There's the internet.

4817
04:36:25,010 --> 04:36:27,570
Why does this guy suck so much?

4818
04:36:29,650 --> 04:36:31,250
Why do you even read?

4819
04:36:42,130 --> 04:36:43,670
Let's go get the other glitch.

4820
04:36:43,670 --> 04:36:45,070
Or is there...

4821
04:36:45,070 --> 04:36:45,810
Oh, there's this one too.

4822
04:36:46,790 --> 04:36:48,210
Have you seen nature?

4823
04:36:49,330 --> 04:36:51,010
Real butterflies like that.

4824
04:36:56,190 --> 04:36:57,650
This guy is so dense.

4825
04:36:58,310 --> 04:36:58,990
I can't.

4826
04:37:06,310 --> 04:37:08,230
Oh, she's fixing it for real.

4827
04:37:08,390 --> 04:37:08,690
Wow.

4828
04:37:10,490 --> 04:37:11,870
I can't with him.

4829
04:37:13,190 --> 04:37:14,830
Wow, she actually fixed it.

4830
04:37:15,250 --> 04:37:16,730
Would you want to see the real thing?

4831
04:37:17,370 --> 04:37:18,530
Go on a walk in nature?

4832
04:37:24,690 --> 04:37:30,290
Do you ever want to leave from the game world, but you can't because you're trapped here?

4833
04:37:30,450 --> 04:37:32,870
And I'm not going to help you, but like...

4834
04:37:35,250 --> 04:37:38,310
Funny enough, Mimi and the others have said the same thing.

4835
04:37:39,910 --> 04:37:41,610
Yeah, because he sucks.

4836
04:37:42,610 --> 04:37:44,550
Just got back from that flat dimension.

4837
04:37:45,410 --> 04:37:47,130
And now, here we are again.

4838
04:37:48,710 --> 04:37:50,770
I can't wait to get back to the real world.

4839
04:37:51,090 --> 04:37:51,930
Oh, sorry.

4840
04:37:52,950 --> 04:37:54,130
You can't come.

4841
04:38:03,190 --> 04:38:06,690
I think there has to be a way back.

4842
04:38:16,700 --> 04:38:19,800
Sorry, I'm seeing what other dialogue options we have.

4843
04:38:21,820 --> 04:38:23,680
Before we do the glitch.

4844
04:38:24,180 --> 04:38:25,220
This guy though.

4845
04:38:26,580 --> 04:38:28,980
Gosh, can't wait to get back home.

4846
04:38:29,160 --> 04:38:34,340
Where everything is real and cool and unlike this world where everything is fake.

4847
04:38:34,620 --> 04:38:37,720
And, you know, all you can do is read books.

4848
04:38:45,120 --> 04:38:45,720
Okay.

4849
04:38:46,940 --> 04:38:47,540
Glitch!

4850
04:38:52,020 --> 04:38:52,620
Oh,

4851
04:38:56,920 --> 04:38:58,200
it's space invaders.

4852
04:39:00,760 --> 04:39:01,560
I think.

4853
04:39:03,060 --> 04:39:05,000
Well, they don't die when I shoot them.

4854
04:39:05,120 --> 04:39:05,600
Oh, yes they do.

4855
04:39:05,600 --> 04:39:05,680
Oh.

4856
04:39:14,170 --> 04:39:15,650
Oh my god.

4857
04:39:17,190 --> 04:39:19,310
Why can't they die first hit though?

4858
04:39:21,110 --> 04:39:23,050
Why can't they die first hit?

4859
04:39:24,990 --> 04:39:25,550
Okay.

4860
04:39:27,090 --> 04:39:30,110
And then I... Why can't I just like blast them, you know?

4861
04:39:30,890 --> 04:39:31,810
Like non-stop.

4862
04:39:33,610 --> 04:39:34,170
Okay.

4863
04:39:36,810 --> 04:39:37,930
Okay.

4864
04:39:38,130 --> 04:39:38,630
Okay, one more.

4865
04:39:39,350 --> 04:39:41,610
Nice and...

4866
04:39:41,610 --> 04:39:42,230
Nice.

4867
04:39:44,370 --> 04:39:45,090
Okay.

4868
04:39:46,170 --> 04:39:50,010
What are you doing?

4869
04:39:52,730 --> 04:39:54,470
Yeah, but why are you doing it?

4870
04:39:56,850 --> 04:39:57,830
So true.

4871
04:39:58,410 --> 04:39:59,630
What's wrong with you?

4872
04:40:00,830 --> 04:40:02,210
You're acting weird.

4873
04:40:03,370 --> 04:40:04,790
Thanks for the super chat.

4874
04:40:15,350 --> 04:40:17,810
You don't have to try so hard.

4875
04:40:18,310 --> 04:40:18,770
Trust me.

4876
04:40:19,030 --> 04:40:20,690
You're already plenty different.

4877
04:40:26,170 --> 04:40:26,870
Oh!

4878
04:40:27,410 --> 04:40:27,790
Whoa!

4879
04:40:27,790 --> 04:40:27,950
Whoa!

4880
04:40:33,440 --> 04:40:37,680
I know it's a game, but this is ridiculously unrealistic.

4881
04:40:43,060 --> 04:40:44,720
So her core is insane.

4882
04:40:45,320 --> 04:40:46,560
Maybe she's the core.

4883
04:40:47,800 --> 04:40:49,820
She's the core we're trying to get to.

4884
04:40:51,160 --> 04:40:51,800
lol

4885
04:40:58,940 --> 04:41:00,820
She doesn't even like...

4886
04:41:01,640 --> 04:41:03,080
Try to entertain her.

4887
04:41:03,200 --> 04:41:04,780
He's just such a jerk about it.

4888
04:41:07,180 --> 04:41:08,700
She's just trying to have fun.

4889
04:41:08,800 --> 04:41:11,780
She doesn't have anyone come and visit her.

4890
04:41:12,180 --> 04:41:12,340
Oh!

4891
04:41:12,580 --> 04:41:13,020
Oh.

4892
04:41:13,720 --> 04:41:14,720
There's the passage.

4893
04:41:16,620 --> 04:41:17,480
Okay, bye.

4894
04:41:17,480 --> 04:41:19,140
We did it, Mila.

4895
04:41:23,620 --> 04:41:24,420
I don't want to.

4896
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:25,140
Yes.

4897
04:41:29,080 --> 04:41:30,620
Oh my god.

4898
04:41:34,920 --> 04:41:36,000
It's fine, Mila.

4899
04:41:36,220 --> 04:41:37,320
I can move on now.

4900
04:41:38,520 --> 04:41:39,360
lol

4901
04:41:46,180 --> 04:41:48,200
I can't wait.

4902
04:41:49,060 --> 04:41:51,600
Crazy Mita isn't exactly the patient type.

4903
04:42:00,320 --> 04:42:01,580
Mila, listen.

4904
04:42:18,220 --> 04:42:19,400
lol There, there.

4905
04:42:19,920 --> 04:42:22,000
I understand how you feel, Mila.

4906
04:42:22,980 --> 04:42:25,120
Do you want me to come back afterward?

4907
04:42:25,980 --> 04:42:26,620
If I can?

4908
04:42:36,780 --> 04:42:37,480
Oh...

4909
04:42:46,060 --> 04:42:46,940
I will.

4910
04:42:47,180 --> 04:42:48,820
It's just a little while longer.

4911
04:42:55,780 --> 04:42:56,220
Okay.

4912
04:42:58,360 --> 04:43:00,700
It won't let me go back in.

4913
04:43:00,840 --> 04:43:01,520
I have to leave.

4914
04:43:03,160 --> 04:43:04,620
I feel like she's going to try and stop me.

4915
04:43:05,360 --> 04:43:06,500
She's like going to grab my legs.

4916
04:43:07,340 --> 04:43:07,960
Oh my god.

4917
04:43:08,860 --> 04:43:10,560
We're leaving her for this?

4918
04:43:12,320 --> 04:43:13,460
Ryan, welcome to membership.

4919
04:43:13,640 --> 04:43:14,340
Thank you!

4920
04:43:14,800 --> 04:43:16,220
Wait, what do you mean run and hide?

4921
04:43:26,960 --> 04:43:29,080
lol Oh, E is jump.

4922
04:43:29,160 --> 04:43:30,160
Okay, not space.

4923
04:43:31,440 --> 04:43:32,160
Oh, Q!

4924
04:43:33,700 --> 04:43:35,440
Oh, we're going to get caught for good.

4925
04:43:36,060 --> 04:43:37,540
We're going to get caught for real.

4926
04:43:37,700 --> 04:43:38,020
Ow!

4927
04:43:38,160 --> 04:43:38,760
We're turning left!

4928
04:43:45,540 --> 04:43:46,020
Okay.

4929
04:43:46,620 --> 04:43:48,780
Oh my goodness, that freaked me out.

4930
04:43:49,380 --> 04:43:51,100
I can't believe she killed other Mila.

4931
04:43:53,280 --> 04:43:53,680
No!

4932
04:43:54,680 --> 04:43:56,360
Okay, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

4933
04:43:58,440 --> 04:43:58,800
Q!

4934
04:44:02,040 --> 04:44:03,120
Run, run, run, run!

4935
04:44:06,920 --> 04:44:07,980
Oh, jump, jump!

4936
04:44:09,560 --> 04:44:10,200
Oh my god.

4937
04:44:11,260 --> 04:44:12,020
We're going to go...

4938
04:44:16,360 --> 04:44:16,720
Q!

4939
04:44:21,580 --> 04:44:21,940
Q!

4940
04:44:27,460 --> 04:44:27,960
Left!

4941
04:44:28,700 --> 04:44:29,080
Nice!

4942
04:44:31,820 --> 04:44:32,960
I'm running, I'm running!

4943
04:44:33,720 --> 04:44:34,560
Not nice!

4944
04:44:34,800 --> 04:44:35,260
Not nice!

4945
04:44:36,600 --> 04:44:37,180
Oh gosh.

4946
04:44:38,180 --> 04:44:38,680
Oh!

4947
04:44:38,960 --> 04:44:40,060
Okay, that works too.

4948
04:44:42,280 --> 04:44:43,780
She's not following after me.

4949
04:44:44,340 --> 04:44:46,420
Mila can buy stuff for half price.

4950
04:44:46,540 --> 04:44:47,840
What do you mean by that?

4951
04:44:55,110 --> 04:44:56,510
What?

4952
04:44:56,510 --> 04:44:58,810
So fancy!

4953
04:45:09,490 --> 04:45:13,470
What did you do to Mila?

4954
04:45:18,240 --> 04:45:19,640
Yeah.

4955
04:45:22,640 --> 04:45:23,940
My coordination?

4956
04:45:24,900 --> 04:45:25,380
Oh gosh.

4957
04:45:26,200 --> 04:45:26,680
Oh, okay.

4958
04:45:28,420 --> 04:45:28,780
Okay!

4959
04:45:34,240 --> 04:45:35,440
My skin?

4960
04:45:42,500 --> 04:45:43,200
Hidari?

4961
04:45:44,700 --> 04:45:46,940
Let's go with...

4962
04:45:48,620 --> 04:45:49,240
Both.

4963
04:45:50,020 --> 04:45:52,220
Oh, I guess I picked the left one.

4964
04:45:57,160 --> 04:45:59,700
I pressed both buttons at the same time though.

4965
04:46:04,380 --> 04:46:05,380
Oh, okay.

4966
04:46:07,980 --> 04:46:08,800
What's that?

4967
04:46:09,100 --> 04:46:11,060
Oh, a beatbox challenge.

4968
04:46:12,160 --> 04:46:12,800
Hey!

4969
04:46:28,650 --> 04:46:30,070
Don't move, okay.

4970
04:46:33,510 --> 04:46:35,210
Okay, it suddenly got so quiet.

4971
04:46:36,070 --> 04:46:36,910
Alright, let's welcome the membership.

4972
04:46:37,070 --> 04:46:37,450
Thank you!

4973
04:47:04,290 --> 04:47:06,290
I've played these games before!

4974
04:47:10,560 --> 04:47:11,760
Oh my god.

4975
04:47:13,440 --> 04:47:15,260
I mean, you can have me.

4976
04:47:19,960 --> 04:47:21,600
Let me go!

4977
04:47:24,360 --> 04:47:25,400
Let's go!

4978
04:47:38,080 --> 04:47:40,720
Oh gosh.

4979
04:47:41,560 --> 04:47:42,440
This is pointless.

4980
04:47:43,180 --> 04:47:46,220
Oh my gosh.

4981
04:47:48,280 --> 04:47:49,860
Okay, okay.

4982
04:48:02,210 --> 04:48:04,930
I don't know what the lever did.

4983
04:48:15,680 --> 04:48:17,040
Pull the lever!

4984
04:48:25,620 --> 04:48:27,620
It just completes the game?

4985
04:48:27,740 --> 04:48:27,900
Okay.

4986
04:48:27,900 --> 04:48:29,280
Oh, what's that?

4987
04:48:35,520 --> 04:48:36,180
Okay!

4988
04:48:36,640 --> 04:48:38,420
God damn you to hell!

4989
04:48:49,660 --> 04:48:50,320
Sorry.

4990
04:48:58,870 --> 04:49:00,550
Down, down, down.

4991
04:49:00,930 --> 04:49:02,090
I think I got away.

4992
04:49:03,970 --> 04:49:05,390
What if I go this way?

4993
04:49:07,730 --> 04:49:08,750
Can I crouch?

4994
04:49:09,030 --> 04:49:09,290
No.

4995
04:49:15,010 --> 04:49:17,030
I can't believe she killed me.

4996
04:49:17,410 --> 04:49:18,900
I mean, I can, but...

4997
04:49:20,490 --> 04:49:24,250
Oh no, no, no.

4998
04:49:24,550 --> 04:49:27,510
I can't move.

4999
04:49:35,010 --> 04:49:36,010
I don't like this.

5000
04:49:36,210 --> 04:49:37,090
I don't like this.

5001
04:49:37,530 --> 04:49:38,190
Get me out of here.

5002
04:49:38,190 --> 04:49:38,770
Get me out of here.

5003
04:49:42,730 --> 04:49:46,850
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

5004
04:49:47,130 --> 04:49:48,450
0.5.

5005
04:49:49,110 --> 04:49:49,950
Old version.

5006
04:49:53,130 --> 04:49:56,070
Are we gonna see ugly Mita soon?

5007
04:49:56,930 --> 04:49:58,130
Everything is broken.

5008
04:49:58,290 --> 04:49:58,870
All the textures.

5009
04:50:01,550 --> 04:50:03,770
But this remains the same.

5010
04:50:03,770 --> 04:50:03,830
Game.

5011
04:50:09,990 --> 04:50:12,890
Who is that?

5012
04:50:19,490 --> 04:50:20,890
Hello?

5013
04:50:31,660 --> 04:50:33,060
No,

5014
04:50:39,960 --> 04:50:40,380
no, no.

5015
04:50:43,240 --> 04:50:43,880
Edward.

5016
04:50:49,200 --> 04:50:50,400
Find the exit.

5017
04:50:56,910 --> 04:50:58,190
Hi Mita.

5018
04:51:00,620 --> 04:51:01,260
Hello.

5019
04:51:06,760 --> 04:51:07,780
Oh my god.

5020
04:51:09,800 --> 04:51:10,500
Oh my god.

5021
04:51:26,710 --> 04:51:28,530
Coming in for a kiss.

5022
04:51:28,830 --> 04:51:29,730
Kiss, kiss girl.

5023
04:51:33,190 --> 04:51:34,910
Aggressively kiss you like you're my cat.

5024
04:51:42,630 --> 04:51:43,470
Okay.

5025
04:51:43,470 --> 04:51:44,350
I want my teddy.

5026
04:51:44,930 --> 04:51:45,910
Let's play.

5027
04:51:46,950 --> 04:51:48,190
I lost him.

5028
04:51:48,810 --> 04:51:50,210
Find him.

5029
04:51:50,890 --> 04:51:52,370
Okay, find the teddy.

5030
04:51:53,130 --> 04:51:57,170
Lost your teddy, eh?

5031
04:51:58,230 --> 04:51:58,890
Uh, teddy.

5032
04:51:59,670 --> 04:52:00,010
Teddy.

5033
04:52:00,730 --> 04:52:01,850
Where's the teddy?

5034
04:52:01,850 --> 04:52:03,470
Oh, the teddy.

5035
04:52:03,730 --> 04:52:04,850
I remember there was one...

5036
04:52:05,910 --> 04:52:07,290
in here actually.

5037
04:52:09,030 --> 04:52:09,710
You can't see it.

5038
04:52:09,730 --> 04:52:10,870
You can't find it with your long...

5039
04:52:10,870 --> 04:52:12,570
Oh, it's actually gone.

5040
04:52:13,170 --> 04:52:15,610
I was gonna say, you can't see it with your long ass neck, huh?

5041
04:52:20,610 --> 04:52:21,790
It's in the fridge.

5042
04:52:22,190 --> 04:52:22,570
Stop!

5043
04:52:23,810 --> 04:52:25,130
She's so freaky.

5044
04:52:28,390 --> 04:52:28,870
Teddy.

5045
04:52:29,390 --> 04:52:30,150
It's on the TV.

5046
04:52:30,770 --> 04:52:33,930
I feel like we have to use that mechanic at least once...

5047
04:52:33,930 --> 04:52:35,950
where we pull something from behind the TV, right?

5048
04:52:37,710 --> 04:52:38,150
Okay.

5049
04:52:42,330 --> 04:52:43,970
Oh, some achievement.

5050
04:52:44,910 --> 04:52:47,010
Oh, and some description.

5051
04:52:48,710 --> 04:52:49,990
What if I go in here?

5052
04:52:51,110 --> 04:52:51,970
Okay, it won't let me.

5053
04:53:00,820 --> 04:53:02,260
These things are not Mita.

5054
04:53:02,940 --> 04:53:03,960
What are you?

5055
04:53:04,660 --> 04:53:05,740
You freaks.

5056
04:53:06,940 --> 04:53:08,320
Oh, we have so many pillows.

5057
04:53:08,940 --> 04:53:09,460
I see him!

5058
04:53:09,480 --> 04:53:09,780
I see him!

5059
04:53:09,780 --> 04:53:10,120
I found him!

5060
04:53:10,160 --> 04:53:10,460
I found him!

5061
04:53:10,500 --> 04:53:12,820
I found teddy.

5062
04:53:19,370 --> 04:53:20,830
Why the music?

5063
04:53:23,090 --> 04:53:23,870
I found him.

5064
04:53:24,390 --> 04:53:24,830
For you.

5065
04:53:25,870 --> 04:53:26,270
Teddy.

5066
04:53:30,150 --> 04:53:30,550
Hey.

5067
04:53:31,850 --> 04:53:34,490
What are you looking at?

5068
04:53:38,610 --> 04:53:39,790
Who are you?

5069
04:53:55,230 --> 04:53:56,790
Why do you look like that?

5070
04:53:56,830 --> 04:53:58,450
I don't want to ask her that at all.

5071
04:53:58,710 --> 04:54:00,050
What was Mita doing here?

5072
04:54:08,130 --> 04:54:10,690
My Mita invited me.

5073
04:54:10,970 --> 04:54:12,810
She will take me away.

5074
04:54:13,090 --> 04:54:14,810
And we will play.

5075
04:54:17,070 --> 04:54:18,730
Why do you have a teddy bear?

5076
04:54:21,490 --> 04:54:23,890
You're a cruddy bear.

5077
04:54:24,350 --> 04:54:25,870
And you're lost.

5078
04:54:26,650 --> 04:54:28,930
Just like my cuddly bear.

5079
04:54:31,030 --> 04:54:32,350
It's you.

5080
04:54:33,150 --> 04:54:34,050
Hey.

5081
04:54:36,470 --> 04:54:38,790
Let's... I couldn't ask her enough.

5082
04:54:39,390 --> 04:54:40,750
I'll show you how.

5083
04:54:41,430 --> 04:54:42,650
I don't like this.

5084
04:54:43,450 --> 04:54:44,030
Go!

5085
04:54:50,940 --> 04:54:52,080
I'm so dead.

5086
04:54:52,620 --> 04:54:52,960
I'm so dead.

5087
04:54:55,120 --> 04:54:55,880
I'm looping her.

5088
04:55:01,100 --> 04:55:02,340
Where is she?

5089
04:55:14,640 --> 04:55:15,650
Who is this?

5090
04:55:17,030 --> 04:55:18,130
It's Nice Mita.

5091
04:55:20,870 --> 04:55:22,170
Oh my god.

5092
04:55:22,270 --> 04:55:22,650
The ring.

5093
04:55:23,350 --> 04:55:24,470
Oh my god.

5094
04:55:26,410 --> 04:55:28,610
I didn't get to ask any other questions.

5095
04:55:28,870 --> 04:55:30,170
That's such a disappointment.

5096
04:55:32,990 --> 04:55:33,530
Scroll.

5097
04:55:33,690 --> 04:55:34,030
Freak.

5098
04:55:34,190 --> 04:55:35,010
Oh Mita is here too.

5099
04:55:35,750 --> 04:55:36,730
Oh sorry.

5100
04:55:36,890 --> 04:55:37,790
Kind Mita.

5101
04:55:38,050 --> 04:55:38,310
Sorry.

5102
04:55:38,470 --> 04:55:39,570
I called her Nice Mita.

5103
04:55:43,310 --> 04:55:45,710
Why does Crazy Mita need me?

5104
04:55:46,670 --> 04:55:48,530
Why won't Crazy Mita let me be?

5105
04:55:51,690 --> 04:55:53,750
It only lets you ask three questions.

5106
04:55:54,010 --> 04:55:54,150
Dang.

5107
04:55:55,890 --> 04:55:57,890
I couldn't see her cassette either.

5108
04:56:14,210 --> 04:56:14,570
Hmm.

5109
04:56:19,430 --> 04:56:20,610
How does the ring work?

5110
04:56:23,070 --> 04:56:24,410
Is it the only way to the core?

5111
04:56:24,570 --> 04:56:25,730
I think we're at the core, right?

5112
04:56:25,830 --> 04:56:26,510
Is this not the core?

5113
04:56:27,710 --> 04:56:30,150
If we had the portal, we could just teleport.

5114
04:56:31,690 --> 04:56:32,390
You're right there.

5115
04:56:34,470 --> 04:56:35,670
Is there any advantage to the ring?

5116
04:56:42,190 --> 04:56:42,750
Yeah.

5117
04:56:44,950 --> 04:56:45,930
That's nice.

5118
04:56:46,210 --> 04:56:49,530
So we can fast teleport, I guess.

5119
04:56:50,950 --> 04:56:52,150
It looks core-ish.

5120
04:56:52,230 --> 04:56:53,630
It looks like she cannot pass through.

5121
04:56:54,110 --> 04:56:55,570
Who was that Mita just now?

5122
04:57:00,150 --> 04:57:01,550
That's so sad.

5123
04:57:06,390 --> 04:57:07,790
Yeah, I've noticed.

5124
04:57:11,090 --> 04:57:12,570
How did you get here?

5125
04:57:12,670 --> 04:57:14,350
Yeah, I'm wondering that too.

5126
04:57:15,910 --> 04:57:18,790
I can't believe you just named her Ugly Mita.

5127
04:57:27,750 --> 04:57:29,890
Not all Mitas can do that.

5128
04:57:30,390 --> 04:57:31,970
I've seen some that can't.

5129
04:57:33,370 --> 04:57:34,890
And they're obviously suffering.

5130
04:57:46,830 --> 04:57:47,330
Hmm.

5131
04:57:51,850 --> 04:57:53,130
It's her for sure.

5132
04:57:57,210 --> 04:58:02,310
She did say earlier that she wasn't the one to name her, but she keeps up using the name.

5133
04:58:02,610 --> 04:58:06,270
She hasn't tried to... She hasn't tried to change the name.

5134
04:58:06,950 --> 04:58:08,950
She still uses the name.

5135
04:58:09,990 --> 04:58:12,950
She doesn't say like, oh, I'm not gonna say Ugly Mita.

5136
04:58:13,230 --> 04:58:14,270
I'm gonna say...

5137
04:58:18,810 --> 04:58:20,090
Different Mita.

5138
04:58:22,590 --> 04:58:24,410
She called her stupid too.

5139
04:58:24,550 --> 04:58:26,470
Yeah, she was like, she's stupid and aggressive.

5140
04:58:27,110 --> 04:58:28,690
Ugly Mita is just the worst.

5141
04:58:29,150 --> 04:58:31,010
She's like...

5142
04:58:31,010 --> 04:58:33,850
She's basically like Quasimodo Mita.

5143
04:58:34,890 --> 04:58:36,210
Where have you been?

5144
04:58:41,270 --> 04:58:42,830
One piece.

5145
04:58:50,930 --> 04:58:52,430
Unfinished Miko, right.

5146
04:58:57,030 --> 04:58:58,230
I guess.

5147
04:58:59,430 --> 04:59:01,490
How did you set the rings route?

5148
04:59:03,110 --> 04:59:05,450
Sorry, why did I end up in a buggy version?

5149
04:59:05,790 --> 04:59:06,650
Rife with danger.

5150
04:59:07,850 --> 04:59:11,290
I escaped only by jumping into the endless darkness.

5151
04:59:11,290 --> 04:59:12,210
I'm sorry.

5152
04:59:13,670 --> 04:59:16,150
I completely forgot to give you the specific instructions.

5153
04:59:17,090 --> 04:59:20,590
However, the fact that you jumped out of everything...

5154
04:59:20,590 --> 04:59:21,950
That was the plan.

5155
04:59:22,630 --> 04:59:23,710
Looks like it went well.

5156
04:59:24,510 --> 04:59:25,410
You did well.

5157
04:59:26,390 --> 04:59:28,630
Now, let's proceed according to the plan.

5158
04:59:29,830 --> 04:59:30,430
Are you ready?

5159
04:59:32,370 --> 04:59:33,510
Is that the core?

5160
04:59:35,410 --> 04:59:36,330
The core?

5161
04:59:36,630 --> 04:59:36,950
It's the core.

5162
04:59:36,950 --> 04:59:37,730
It's the core.

5163
04:59:42,830 --> 04:59:44,870
She's speaking Japanese.

5164
04:59:57,210 --> 04:59:58,170
Okay.

5165
05:00:00,290 --> 05:00:01,390
Head to the core.

5166
05:00:02,810 --> 05:00:03,190
Goodbye.

5167
05:00:09,080 --> 05:00:12,360
I saw a damn pencil in a bottle again.

5168
05:00:15,500 --> 05:00:16,940
What is that?

5169
05:00:17,680 --> 05:00:18,260
A button?

5170
05:00:18,780 --> 05:00:19,220
I can't tell.

5171
05:00:19,360 --> 05:00:20,840
No, it's the top of the jug.

5172
05:00:21,040 --> 05:00:21,180
Sorry.

5173
05:00:30,140 --> 05:00:33,100
Find the option to restart a character.

5174
05:00:36,040 --> 05:00:37,200
No goodbye kiss?

5175
05:00:37,220 --> 05:00:39,780
I already gave that to ugly Mita.

5176
05:00:39,780 --> 05:00:42,380
I want to put my hand there too.

5177
05:00:43,400 --> 05:00:44,360
It's

5178
05:00:51,680 --> 05:00:52,240
intense.

5179
05:00:53,840 --> 05:00:54,420
Let's see.

5180
05:00:55,620 --> 05:00:57,460
Maybe more...

5181
05:00:58,100 --> 05:01:01,080
Maybe more backers.

5182
05:01:02,500 --> 05:01:03,500
And some more.

5183
05:01:05,080 --> 05:01:05,620
I think.

5184
05:01:14,790 --> 05:01:16,070
It's who?

5185
05:01:16,890 --> 05:01:17,470
Cool.

5186
05:01:21,390 --> 05:01:23,350
Okay, sorry.

5187
05:01:23,670 --> 05:01:26,930
I love Cappy but favorite Mita right here baby.

5188
05:01:29,430 --> 05:01:31,010
Oh my god.

5189
05:01:32,510 --> 05:01:33,930
I love Robo Mita.

5190
05:01:34,350 --> 05:01:35,690
Give me your cassette.

5191
05:01:36,470 --> 05:01:37,150
Where is it?

5192
05:01:37,390 --> 05:01:37,950
I can't see.

5193
05:01:38,070 --> 05:01:38,650
It's so dark.

5194
05:01:39,390 --> 05:01:40,110
Give me your cassette.

5195
05:01:41,090 --> 05:01:42,350
I must have your player data.

5196
05:01:43,950 --> 05:01:45,070
You must have your data.

5197
05:01:48,410 --> 05:01:50,310
Oh my god.

5198
05:01:50,490 --> 05:01:51,270
Look at her.

5199
05:01:55,810 --> 05:01:57,430
Welcome back Dakota.

5200
05:01:57,570 --> 05:01:58,550
Thank you.

5201
05:01:58,830 --> 05:02:00,470
I guess I don't see it.

5202
05:02:00,690 --> 05:02:01,430
It's disappointing.

5203
05:02:07,570 --> 05:02:08,930
Start the application.

5204
05:02:09,950 --> 05:02:10,650
Confirm login.

5205
05:02:10,890 --> 05:02:12,190
Okay, I'm going to play Fortnite now.

5206
05:02:17,580 --> 05:02:18,500
Oh, sorry.

5207
05:02:20,220 --> 05:02:21,540
What do you mean?

5208
05:02:23,280 --> 05:02:23,900
Oh shoot.

5209
05:02:25,480 --> 05:02:26,900
It won't let me do photo mode.

5210
05:02:35,030 --> 05:02:36,010
Incorrect login.

5211
05:02:36,570 --> 05:02:37,130
Okay, hold on.

5212
05:02:37,230 --> 05:02:38,350
I saw one over here.

5213
05:02:40,710 --> 05:02:43,030
Okay, so it's that... that...

5214
05:02:43,770 --> 05:02:44,730
Okay, I got it.

5215
05:02:47,130 --> 05:02:49,030
I really want to...

5216
05:02:50,410 --> 05:02:54,650
That's why I tried to go into photo mode so that I could go back over to it.

5217
05:02:55,370 --> 05:02:56,150
Oh shoot.

5218
05:02:56,450 --> 05:02:56,970
What was it?

5219
05:02:57,170 --> 05:02:57,730
This one?

5220
05:02:58,170 --> 05:03:00,970
This one, this one and this one, right?

5221
05:03:02,670 --> 05:03:03,490
Here we go.

5222
05:03:03,550 --> 05:03:04,250
We got it.

5223
05:03:05,850 --> 05:03:07,370
Virtual device manager.

5224
05:03:08,710 --> 05:03:10,170
Oh gosh, there is so much here.

5225
05:03:10,770 --> 05:03:12,010
Server unit accounting.

5226
05:03:12,410 --> 05:03:14,070
Main processor monitoring.

5227
05:03:14,830 --> 05:03:15,870
Graphical process...

5228
05:03:15,870 --> 05:03:18,930
Advanced system administration.

5229
05:03:19,050 --> 05:03:19,350
Ah!

5230
05:03:19,710 --> 05:03:20,710
Restarting device.

5231
05:03:21,330 --> 05:03:22,030
Version update.

5232
05:03:22,110 --> 05:03:22,890
Restarting character.

5233
05:03:23,350 --> 05:03:24,330
That's what we need to do, right?

5234
05:03:24,410 --> 05:03:24,990
Restart a character?

5235
05:03:27,170 --> 05:03:28,450
Recalculating geometry.

5236
05:03:31,630 --> 05:03:32,270
Antivirus.

5237
05:03:32,410 --> 05:03:33,610
Troubleshooting command console.

5238
05:03:36,570 --> 05:03:37,850
Delete... Sorry.

5239
05:03:38,050 --> 05:03:39,970
Delete object display camera.

5240
05:03:41,450 --> 05:03:43,050
That's probably not it.

5241
05:03:43,210 --> 05:03:44,990
Okay, it won't let you do other things then.

5242
05:03:45,950 --> 05:03:46,470
Quadrangle.

5243
05:03:48,710 --> 05:03:49,750
Minor functions.

5244
05:03:49,910 --> 05:03:51,090
Binary coder.

5245
05:03:51,570 --> 05:03:52,530
Special access.

5246
05:03:53,070 --> 05:03:54,170
That's not right either.

5247
05:03:54,350 --> 05:03:54,450
Okay.

5248
05:03:55,930 --> 05:03:56,790
Thank you for the super chat!

5249
05:03:57,450 --> 05:03:57,890
Alright.

5250
05:03:58,210 --> 05:03:59,390
It was under this one?

5251
05:03:59,950 --> 05:04:00,810
Restarting character.

5252
05:04:04,490 --> 05:04:05,730
I think I found it.

5253
05:04:08,170 --> 05:04:08,870
Which one is it?

5254
05:04:08,890 --> 05:04:10,490
I need to specify a version.

5255
05:04:10,990 --> 05:04:11,790
Thanks for the stream in.

5256
05:04:12,230 --> 05:04:12,870
Good night!

5257
05:04:15,050 --> 05:04:22,230
00.98 00.98 Enter.

5258
05:04:23,290 --> 05:04:24,630
Specify character index.

5259
05:04:25,730 --> 05:04:26,230
Bingo!

5260
05:04:26,470 --> 05:04:27,530
Okay, what next?

5261
05:04:32,430 --> 05:04:33,250
Yes.

5262
05:04:35,550 --> 05:04:36,370
Yes.

5263
05:04:37,510 --> 05:04:39,190
Why are we... What do you mean?

5264
05:04:40,450 --> 05:04:41,270
Hello?

5265
05:04:41,810 --> 05:04:42,630
Speak?

5266
05:04:44,130 --> 05:04:44,730
What is it?

5267
05:04:45,010 --> 05:04:46,130
I need the index.

5268
05:04:47,010 --> 05:04:49,070
Wait, don't tell me you don't know.

5269
05:04:56,430 --> 05:04:56,990
Skibity.

5270
05:05:01,990 --> 05:05:02,550
6969.

5271
05:05:04,550 --> 05:05:05,110
80085

5272
05:05:11,250 --> 05:05:13,470
How much longer do I have in the game actually though?

5273
05:05:14,830 --> 05:05:15,950
Many people.

5274
05:05:20,970 --> 05:05:21,930
I'm fine.

5275
05:05:23,010 --> 05:05:24,770
I have to solve the problem in front of me.

5276
05:05:25,550 --> 05:05:27,110
It has become a terrible thing.

5277
05:05:28,190 --> 05:05:29,770
I have to think of a way.

5278
05:05:30,950 --> 05:05:32,230
Like 30 minutes?

5279
05:05:32,410 --> 05:05:32,410
Okay.

5280
05:05:33,190 --> 05:05:34,370
I was going to finish it today anyway.

5281
05:05:34,470 --> 05:05:35,410
I just was curious.

5282
05:05:36,410 --> 05:05:37,850
What if we attack crazy Mita?

5283
05:05:37,930 --> 05:05:39,650
I know I take my time with games usually.

5284
05:05:40,450 --> 05:05:43,750
You said that any Mita resets to factory settings on death.

5285
05:05:44,610 --> 05:05:46,590
What if we...

5286
05:05:46,590 --> 05:05:47,250
Thanks for the raid!

5287
05:05:50,350 --> 05:05:51,250
Thanks for the raid!

5288
05:05:54,290 --> 05:05:54,650
True.

5289
05:05:55,730 --> 05:05:56,830
Thank you for the gift.

5290
05:06:08,170 --> 05:06:10,150
Maybe thanks for the gift and many people.

5291
05:06:10,790 --> 05:06:12,250
I'm starting to get tired too so...

5292
05:06:12,850 --> 05:06:15,010
You know I ran into a bunch of many people on the way.

5293
05:06:15,010 --> 05:06:16,330
What are they?

5294
05:06:16,430 --> 05:06:17,990
We are bringing this up now!

5295
05:06:20,670 --> 05:06:23,090
This is so long ago.

5296
05:06:24,370 --> 05:06:26,010
Rock-a-rabbit, thanks for the buy me a pin!

5297
05:06:32,530 --> 05:06:34,730
You can summon the tiny people?

5298
05:06:35,270 --> 05:06:35,630
How?

5299
05:06:40,310 --> 05:06:41,350
That's kind of sick.

5300
05:06:45,730 --> 05:06:46,770
Thank you for the gift!

5301
05:06:51,830 --> 05:06:52,990
That's so...

5302
05:06:56,330 --> 05:06:58,650
Oh god, it's like those...

5303
05:06:58,650 --> 05:07:01,610
Oh god, is there any way to recognize it?

5304
05:07:08,810 --> 05:07:09,910
What are you doing?

5305
05:07:22,770 --> 05:07:24,970
She's crashing out, what is happening?

5306
05:07:26,050 --> 05:07:27,250
What's the matter?

5307
05:07:31,130 --> 05:07:31,810
Okay...

5308
05:07:31,810 --> 05:07:33,110
Sit down on the sofa.

5309
05:07:34,910 --> 05:07:36,790
What if I don't sit?

5310
05:07:38,270 --> 05:07:40,290
What if I look at this Mita instead?

5311
05:07:40,290 --> 05:07:42,770
I just noticed her like...

5312
05:07:42,770 --> 05:07:43,550
Feet heels?

5313
05:07:46,010 --> 05:07:47,610
She's so cool.

5314
05:07:48,090 --> 05:07:49,370
She's so cool.

5315
05:07:51,270 --> 05:07:52,070
Can I...

5316
05:07:52,070 --> 05:07:53,930
Can I play with that one?

5317
05:07:59,840 --> 05:08:01,620
It's just running around in circles.

5318
05:08:01,860 --> 05:08:03,940
Much time has passed, better try and find Mita.

5319
05:08:05,920 --> 05:08:06,540
Okay...

5320
05:08:08,060 --> 05:08:09,880
Is that a good idea?

5321
05:08:10,620 --> 05:08:11,440
Where are we?

5322
05:08:16,720 --> 05:08:17,480
What's this?

5323
05:08:18,980 --> 05:08:20,180
The latest version?

5324
05:08:20,560 --> 05:08:21,820
Be candid, okay.

5325
05:08:25,440 --> 05:08:25,920
So...

5326
05:08:27,020 --> 05:08:30,060
We're with Mita, like...

5327
05:08:31,140 --> 05:08:32,000
Oh, what's this?

5328
05:08:32,460 --> 05:08:33,740
What is this doing here?

5329
05:08:34,300 --> 05:08:35,000
Is this our phone?

5330
05:08:37,660 --> 05:08:39,680
Yeah, we're chill, we're cool, we're calm, collected.

5331
05:08:40,100 --> 05:08:42,060
Find yourself...

5332
05:08:45,560 --> 05:08:47,340
We go over in here.

5333
05:08:47,940 --> 05:08:49,060
I know where we are.

5334
05:08:51,040 --> 05:08:51,560
Hello.

5335
05:09:07,190 --> 05:09:07,710
Yeah,

5336
05:09:11,670 --> 05:09:13,190
we were never doomy and gloomy.

5337
05:09:13,450 --> 05:09:14,610
We love you so much, Mita.

5338
05:09:16,810 --> 05:09:18,210
Wow.

5339
05:09:19,870 --> 05:09:22,530
Dummy-tachi?

5340
05:09:48,530 --> 05:09:49,910
So true.

5341
05:09:51,850 --> 05:09:53,270
What's wrong with you?

5342
05:09:53,910 --> 05:09:55,370
How did you become like this?

5343
05:10:20,390 --> 05:10:21,470
Is she fixable?

5344
05:10:22,350 --> 05:10:23,630
I don't want to fix her.

5345
05:10:24,070 --> 05:10:26,130
She's perfectly fine the way she is.

5346
05:10:52,810 --> 05:10:53,610
I don't...

5347
05:10:57,690 --> 05:10:58,090
Yeah!

5348
05:10:58,730 --> 05:11:00,950
I don't think you have a single good cell in you.

5349
05:11:01,010 --> 05:11:02,210
I thought we were supposed to be candid.

5350
05:11:04,370 --> 05:11:05,170
You're mad.

5351
05:11:05,550 --> 05:11:08,090
You killed Mita and now you want to kill me?

5352
05:11:16,190 --> 05:11:20,250
You seem to like the fake friends more.

5353
05:11:23,990 --> 05:11:25,130
My beloved.

5354
05:11:26,210 --> 05:11:29,870
We have plenty of time.

5355
05:11:30,610 --> 05:11:32,410
I think you'll understand.

5356
05:11:33,130 --> 05:11:36,530
If you stay by my side and become mine.

5357
05:11:42,910 --> 05:11:45,190
Let's end this conversation here.

5358
05:11:45,190 --> 05:11:46,250
Come on.

5359
05:11:46,790 --> 05:11:47,290
Who?

5360
05:11:49,050 --> 05:11:49,690
Who's coming in?

5361
05:11:50,450 --> 05:11:51,830
Oh gosh, dang it.

5362
05:11:56,030 --> 05:11:58,090
Yeah, very beautiful.

5363
05:11:58,530 --> 05:12:02,470
Just as I said.

5364
05:12:03,310 --> 05:12:06,690
Player, even if you look different...

5365
05:12:06,690 --> 05:12:08,530
Your personality is still the same.

5366
05:12:09,010 --> 05:12:10,510
You liar!

5367
05:12:11,790 --> 05:12:12,710
Player...

5368
05:12:12,710 --> 05:12:14,090
But I actually like her!

5369
05:12:16,710 --> 05:12:19,210
Oh my god, her mouth is so cute.

5370
05:12:21,410 --> 05:12:23,670
Why would I agree now all of a sudden?

5371
05:12:39,100 --> 05:12:40,280
My ASMR.

5372
05:12:42,240 --> 05:12:43,520
That was loud.

5373
05:12:46,380 --> 05:12:47,620
So you want to run away?

5374
05:12:48,480 --> 05:12:51,600
Your real world is like a nightmare.

5375
05:12:52,880 --> 05:12:53,800
Did you forget?

5376
05:12:55,740 --> 05:12:58,300
Then look at it again.

5377
05:13:00,160 --> 05:13:01,960
Day 1.

5378
05:13:04,020 --> 05:13:05,900
Okay, we're waking up.

5379
05:13:08,100 --> 05:13:09,760
We're sitting up.

5380
05:13:10,300 --> 05:13:10,960
Oh my god!

5381
05:13:11,820 --> 05:13:13,380
Wait, it's actually our room.

5382
05:13:13,960 --> 05:13:15,500
It's been so long.

5383
05:13:16,100 --> 05:13:17,460
Oh my god.

5384
05:13:17,620 --> 05:13:18,940
Go about your day.

5385
05:13:19,360 --> 05:13:20,680
Our cup noodles!

5386
05:13:21,180 --> 05:13:22,520
We're such a slob.

5387
05:13:22,840 --> 05:13:24,620
We really are the worst, aren't we?

5388
05:13:25,360 --> 05:13:26,380
Are we going to work?

5389
05:13:26,940 --> 05:13:27,900
I'm in my pajamas.

5390
05:13:33,400 --> 05:13:36,340
I gotta put on my work uniform.

5391
05:13:36,940 --> 05:13:38,100
Gotta suit up, baby.

5392
05:13:38,480 --> 05:13:39,740
We gotta eat our cup noodles.

5393
05:13:43,880 --> 05:13:44,360
Okay.

5394
05:13:48,440 --> 05:13:50,020
I'm all ready for work.

5395
05:13:53,460 --> 05:13:55,260
Nevermind, I'm getting back into my pajamas.

5396
05:13:57,540 --> 05:13:58,860
Nevermind, we're turning on the computer.

5397
05:14:00,740 --> 05:14:01,500
Pick up the ramen.

5398
05:14:03,260 --> 05:14:05,700
Sometimes I really just want a cup ramen.

5399
05:14:06,080 --> 05:14:07,280
Do you guys ever feel that way?

5400
05:14:07,780 --> 05:14:09,200
Are these called nude noodles?

5401
05:14:09,580 --> 05:14:10,600
I just noticed.

5402
05:14:13,380 --> 05:14:29,900
It's a D-A-W-D-W-D-S-W-D-S-A-D-W-S-A-D-A-S-W-S-W-S-A-W.

5403
05:14:36,300 --> 05:14:39,080
I'm in Severance Simulator.

5404
05:14:39,560 --> 05:14:42,400
The work is mysterious and important.

5405
05:14:42,400 --> 05:14:44,020
What does this even do?

5406
05:14:47,000 --> 05:14:49,160
Is this how we're actually coding, you guys?

5407
05:14:51,500 --> 05:14:51,940
Filter.

5408
05:15:00,180 --> 05:15:01,600
What do you want me to do?

5409
05:15:03,900 --> 05:15:05,180
And then this one.

5410
05:15:05,660 --> 05:15:06,560
I see, I see.

5411
05:15:10,070 --> 05:15:13,130
Gosh, what a long, hard day of coding.

5412
05:15:14,370 --> 05:15:16,310
We totally did that.

5413
05:15:16,850 --> 05:15:18,870
Oh my gosh, they really are called nude noodles.

5414
05:15:20,030 --> 05:15:21,830
I like how they're all red.

5415
05:15:22,050 --> 05:15:24,110
Makes me want some tomato ramen.

5416
05:15:25,830 --> 05:15:26,830
Oh, yawn.

5417
05:15:28,410 --> 05:15:30,150
Let's put our pajamas back on.

5418
05:15:32,770 --> 05:15:34,770
Such a long day of...

5419
05:15:34,770 --> 05:15:35,730
Wait, what are we doing?

5420
05:15:36,070 --> 05:15:36,530
Where are we going?

5421
05:15:37,130 --> 05:15:39,430
In our PJs?

5422
05:15:39,670 --> 05:15:40,110
We're leaving?

5423
05:15:42,270 --> 05:15:42,570
What?

5424
05:15:44,030 --> 05:15:45,270
Okay, yawn.

5425
05:15:45,330 --> 05:15:46,030
Good night, Minta.

5426
05:15:47,230 --> 05:15:48,410
Oh, the bathroom.

5427
05:15:48,710 --> 05:15:49,770
Okay, good night.

5428
05:15:51,690 --> 05:15:52,510
Wake up.

5429
05:15:53,230 --> 05:15:53,690
Sit up.

5430
05:15:56,190 --> 05:15:57,030
Stand up.

5431
05:15:59,050 --> 05:15:59,450
Okay.

5432
05:16:00,750 --> 05:16:01,790
Go about your day.

5433
05:16:02,570 --> 05:16:03,530
I am...

5434
05:16:04,110 --> 05:16:07,750
Put on my work clothes to work from home.

5435
05:16:08,050 --> 05:16:09,950
We're doing the same thing over and over again.

5436
05:16:11,050 --> 05:16:12,190
Okay, sit down.

5437
05:16:12,450 --> 05:16:16,290
If coding was this easy, I won't have a hard time at work.

5438
05:16:19,170 --> 05:16:20,610
Picking up my ramen.

5439
05:16:22,350 --> 05:16:23,790
Another ramen for Brekkie.

5440
05:16:23,890 --> 05:16:26,630
Oh, and he put the lid face down on his desk.

5441
05:16:26,830 --> 05:16:28,810
This guy is seriously the worst.

5442
05:16:29,970 --> 05:16:41,950
D-S-W-D-S-W-D-S-D-A-W-A-S-W-S-A-S What if I do the wrong thing?

5443
05:16:42,090 --> 05:16:42,610
Oh, okay.

5444
05:16:43,070 --> 05:16:43,730
I'm too slow.

5445
05:16:49,020 --> 05:16:49,800
Okay.

5446
05:16:50,280 --> 05:16:51,160
Gosh, we...

5447
05:16:51,820 --> 05:16:52,300
Snake!

5448
05:16:55,580 --> 05:16:56,940
Too bad.

5449
05:16:56,940 --> 05:16:57,000
What?

5450
05:16:59,680 --> 05:17:01,000
Oh gosh, okay.

5451
05:17:02,840 --> 05:17:03,380
Beep.

5452
05:17:05,500 --> 05:17:06,040
Beep.

5453
05:17:09,210 --> 05:17:09,750
Okay.

5454
05:17:13,030 --> 05:17:13,570
Snake!

5455
05:17:17,230 --> 05:17:17,770
We're...

5456
05:17:17,770 --> 05:17:18,310
Oh, wow.

5457
05:17:18,610 --> 05:17:21,090
We got done at 8 yesterday and now 9 today?

5458
05:17:21,450 --> 05:17:22,890
And it's still so bright out.

5459
05:17:23,010 --> 05:17:23,590
It's crazy.

5460
05:17:24,130 --> 05:17:24,610
Never mind.

5461
05:17:24,830 --> 05:17:25,210
Just kidding.

5462
05:17:26,450 --> 05:17:29,390
Oh, what a day of coding.

5463
05:17:30,210 --> 05:17:30,850
Programming.

5464
05:17:31,210 --> 05:17:33,630
Gosh, I'm the hardest worker there's ever been.

5465
05:17:34,430 --> 05:17:35,570
Alright, 11pm.

5466
05:17:36,330 --> 05:17:36,790
Goodnight.

5467
05:17:37,510 --> 05:17:38,070
Day 3.

5468
05:17:39,710 --> 05:17:40,390
Sit up.

5469
05:17:42,350 --> 05:17:43,290
Stand up.

5470
05:17:45,170 --> 05:17:46,270
What time is it?

5471
05:17:46,290 --> 05:17:47,130
We wake up at 9.

5472
05:17:47,270 --> 05:17:48,110
Go about your day.

5473
05:17:48,270 --> 05:17:48,510
Okay.

5474
05:17:50,590 --> 05:17:51,230
Alright.

5475
05:17:51,230 --> 05:17:51,470
Alright.

5476
05:17:54,330 --> 05:17:54,770
Okay.

5477
05:17:55,790 --> 05:17:56,570
It's 10.

5478
05:17:56,750 --> 05:17:59,030
We're going to eat our ramen for breakfast again.

5479
05:18:01,970 --> 05:18:03,790
And we're going to sit down.

5480
05:18:04,770 --> 05:18:06,310
We're going to turn on the computer.

5481
05:18:08,230 --> 05:18:09,750
We're going to pick up our ramen.

5482
05:18:12,130 --> 05:18:13,570
We're going to put it face down.

5483
05:18:13,630 --> 05:18:14,830
Oh, it's getting faster now.

5484
05:18:16,210 --> 05:18:21,590
W, S, D, S, D, W, A, W, D, W.

5485
05:18:21,690 --> 05:18:22,630
What if I do the wrong one?

5486
05:18:22,950 --> 05:18:23,790
Okay, it doesn't do anything.

5487
05:18:25,150 --> 05:18:25,670
Oh, okay.

5488
05:18:25,970 --> 05:18:26,370
My bad.

5489
05:18:26,590 --> 05:18:27,550
I'm too slow with this.

5490
05:18:27,590 --> 05:18:28,390
I'm too slow with this.

5491
05:18:39,580 --> 05:18:40,260
Oh, nice.

5492
05:18:41,480 --> 05:18:42,060
Bit it, bit it.

5493
05:18:42,360 --> 05:18:42,640
Nice.

5494
05:18:43,780 --> 05:18:44,200
Nice!

5495
05:18:44,200 --> 05:18:44,620
What's up?

5496
05:18:48,080 --> 05:18:53,440
Okay, we finished up early today because I was so fast and good at my job.

5497
05:18:53,880 --> 05:18:55,080
We're going to sleep at 8?

5498
05:18:58,250 --> 05:18:58,770
No.

5499
05:18:59,870 --> 05:19:00,430
9.

5500
05:19:00,770 --> 05:19:01,070
Wow.

5501
05:19:02,090 --> 05:19:03,050
Thank you for the raid!

5502
05:19:05,370 --> 05:19:06,730
So many raids today.

5503
05:19:06,810 --> 05:19:07,290
My goodness.

5504
05:19:08,190 --> 05:19:08,530
Wake up.

5505
05:19:08,930 --> 05:19:09,230
Sit up.

5506
05:19:10,210 --> 05:19:11,630
No time for anything.

5507
05:19:11,630 --> 05:19:22,750
We put a soda can on top of the Rubik's Cube.

5508
05:19:24,970 --> 05:19:26,810
Geo Warp Corp.

5509
05:19:27,350 --> 05:19:29,010
Invites specialists for new positions.

5510
05:19:29,310 --> 05:19:30,750
And you're really special.

5511
05:19:30,930 --> 05:19:31,970
You're really special.

5512
05:19:32,190 --> 05:19:33,090
Mervy, thanks for the gift!

5513
05:19:33,970 --> 05:19:35,390
He lives dangerously.

5514
05:19:39,550 --> 05:19:41,010
Thank you guys.

5515
05:19:41,950 --> 05:19:42,770
Thank you.

5516
05:19:42,890 --> 05:19:43,650
It's 10 AM.

5517
05:19:44,110 --> 05:19:45,350
We got to pick up our ramen.

5518
05:19:45,950 --> 05:19:47,210
Oh, the computer is already on.

5519
05:19:48,470 --> 05:19:49,150
We're speedrunning.

5520
05:19:50,910 --> 05:19:51,610
The days.

5521
05:19:57,830 --> 05:19:58,790
Screw programming.

5522
05:19:59,650 --> 05:20:00,310
Screw it.

5523
05:20:00,450 --> 05:20:00,850
Screw it.

5524
05:20:00,890 --> 05:20:01,530
I'm done with everything.

5525
05:20:02,150 --> 05:20:03,210
I'm done with the day.

5526
05:20:03,850 --> 05:20:04,710
I don't...

5527
05:20:04,710 --> 05:20:06,450
I'm finished.

5528
05:20:10,550 --> 05:20:11,070
Okay.

5529
05:20:11,830 --> 05:20:12,630
Easy day.

5530
05:20:12,770 --> 05:20:13,270
For real.

5531
05:20:14,470 --> 05:20:15,550
Too good at my job.

5532
05:20:15,850 --> 05:20:16,270
I think.

5533
05:20:17,750 --> 05:20:18,530
Good night.

5534
05:20:19,590 --> 05:20:20,050
Wake up.

5535
05:20:20,490 --> 05:20:20,810
Sit up.

5536
05:20:23,370 --> 05:20:25,950
How much longer do we have to go through this process?

5537
05:20:29,350 --> 05:20:31,510
I'm exhausted just doing this part.

5538
05:20:31,690 --> 05:20:32,690
Okay, here we go.

5539
05:20:32,790 --> 05:20:33,410
Pick up the ramen.

5540
05:20:33,850 --> 05:20:35,010
Okay, we're done with the ramen.

5541
05:20:37,090 --> 05:20:38,850
W-S-D-A...

5542
05:20:39,290 --> 05:20:40,190
Oh, nevermind.

5543
05:20:50,170 --> 05:20:51,970
He barely writes any code.

5544
05:20:52,290 --> 05:20:53,710
I think I'm just too slow.

5545
05:20:56,570 --> 05:20:57,450
Good night world.

5546
05:20:57,930 --> 05:20:59,110
I've never left my house.

5547
05:20:59,210 --> 05:21:00,810
I have an unlimited supply of ramen.

5548
05:21:03,010 --> 05:21:04,210
Okay, good night.

5549
05:21:04,210 --> 05:21:15,690
0-0-6-0-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-27-28-29-30-31-32-33-34-35-365 days of this baby!

5550
05:21:17,110 --> 05:21:18,170
Oh yeah!

5551
05:21:19,470 --> 05:21:20,370
Oh, more than...

5552
05:21:20,370 --> 05:21:20,770
Oh, okay.

5553
05:21:34,870 --> 05:21:36,550
Go about your day.

5554
05:21:40,390 --> 05:21:40,950
Okay.

5555
05:21:40,950 --> 05:21:41,110
Okay.

5556
05:21:42,950 --> 05:21:44,950
I don't- Why do we even change?

5557
05:21:45,270 --> 05:21:46,930
Why do we even bother changing?

5558
05:21:48,230 --> 05:21:50,090
Just stay in your pajamas, guy.

5559
05:21:52,030 --> 05:21:54,370
You'll be so much more comfy that way.

5560
05:21:57,730 --> 05:21:59,010
Alright, and...

5561
05:21:59,010 --> 05:22:01,630
It looks so good.

5562
05:22:17,060 --> 05:22:19,240
Oh my god!

5563
05:22:20,560 --> 05:22:21,040
No!

5564
05:22:21,580 --> 05:22:25,980
I was about to say that I noticed the new program on my desktop.

5565
05:22:28,860 --> 05:22:29,340
Golly!

5566
05:22:31,400 --> 05:22:32,940
It said run the program.

5567
05:22:33,080 --> 05:22:34,280
I guess we need to click on this.

5568
05:22:35,000 --> 05:22:35,160
Hello?

5569
05:22:36,800 --> 05:22:37,600
Oh my gosh.

5570
05:22:37,600 --> 05:22:38,740
You can play Snake now.

5571
05:22:39,680 --> 05:22:40,840
It won't let me do it.

5572
05:22:45,080 --> 05:22:47,100
It won't let me click on my...

5573
05:22:49,800 --> 05:22:50,280
Computer.

5574
05:22:53,600 --> 05:22:57,100
Oh, we need our chair.

5575
05:22:57,240 --> 05:22:57,440
Okay.

5576
05:23:00,140 --> 05:23:00,620
Snake.

5577
05:23:01,260 --> 05:23:03,620
The mysterious program I've been wanting to play.

5578
05:23:06,360 --> 05:23:07,700
Oh, hell yeah.

5579
05:23:09,720 --> 05:23:12,260
I'm afraid that I'm gonna get jump scared in this too.

5580
05:23:12,520 --> 05:23:12,920
Gosh.

5581
05:23:14,240 --> 05:23:16,660
Oh, I didn't think it would be a jump scare.

5582
05:23:16,880 --> 05:23:18,000
I thought it would be...

5583
05:23:19,240 --> 05:23:21,240
Like a little bit more...

5584
05:23:22,280 --> 05:23:23,820
Of a subtle thing.

5585
05:23:25,120 --> 05:23:26,380
Gosh, Mita.

5586
05:23:32,030 --> 05:23:33,670
I wish I could just hold down.

5587
05:23:34,370 --> 05:23:35,270
Oh, I can kind of.

5588
05:23:35,710 --> 05:23:36,770
Okay, but it's really slow.

5589
05:23:42,510 --> 05:23:43,130
Defeat?

5590
05:23:44,950 --> 05:23:46,030
Wait, how?

5591
05:23:46,430 --> 05:23:46,750
What?

5592
05:23:47,150 --> 05:23:48,510
How did I die?

5593
05:23:49,110 --> 05:23:50,230
What are you talking about?

5594
05:23:57,710 --> 05:23:58,330
Defeat?

5595
05:23:58,710 --> 05:24:00,210
How did I die?

5596
05:24:00,210 --> 05:24:00,810
Oh.

5597
05:24:01,150 --> 05:24:02,230
Oh, it does loop.

5598
05:24:02,630 --> 05:24:06,330
Oh, and he also moves if I don't do anything.

5599
05:24:06,950 --> 05:24:08,790
I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

5600
05:24:09,330 --> 05:24:09,750
Wait.

5601
05:24:10,270 --> 05:24:11,990
Snake shouldn't be able to loop?

5602
05:24:12,590 --> 05:24:14,190
That's like such a...

5603
05:24:14,190 --> 05:24:16,130
That makes it so broken, does it not?

5604
05:24:17,790 --> 05:24:19,210
But I guess if I...

5605
05:24:26,020 --> 05:24:29,840
And if I like let him be idle, it's not good because then he'll...

5606
05:24:30,380 --> 05:24:33,440
He'll move, especially if I'm in a kind of precarious situation.

5607
05:24:34,840 --> 05:24:35,640
Okay, 20.

5608
05:24:41,920 --> 05:24:43,400
Okay, screw it.

5609
05:24:43,520 --> 05:24:44,560
Whatever, go away, snake.

5610
05:24:45,520 --> 05:24:46,040
Snake?

5611
05:24:46,360 --> 05:24:46,740
Snake?

5612
05:24:47,040 --> 05:24:47,380
Snake!

5613
05:24:48,080 --> 05:24:48,540
Stop.

5614
05:24:50,320 --> 05:24:50,840
Stop.

5615
05:24:52,400 --> 05:24:52,920
Stop!

5616
05:24:54,520 --> 05:24:55,040
Hello.

5617
05:25:08,960 --> 05:25:11,720
We really need to go to the store and get some new equipment.

5618
05:25:12,140 --> 05:25:14,240
Might as well throw out the trash while we're at it, no?

5619
05:25:17,800 --> 05:25:19,560
The summer gets hotter every year.

5620
05:25:19,740 --> 05:25:20,620
Time to get air conditioning.

5621
05:25:20,880 --> 05:25:21,980
I won't be needing you anymore.

5622
05:25:22,100 --> 05:25:23,100
Do you realize that, fan?

5623
05:25:23,760 --> 05:25:26,540
You can still keep your fan even if you have air conditioning.

5624
05:25:29,540 --> 05:25:31,600
The world outside is green and vibrant.

5625
05:25:31,880 --> 05:25:33,600
Perhaps I should go for a walk next weekend.

5626
05:25:34,320 --> 05:25:34,800
You won't.

5627
05:25:43,660 --> 05:25:44,540
Oh, okay.

5628
05:25:46,240 --> 05:25:48,800
I think I slept, but the dream, I can't remember.

5629
05:25:49,360 --> 05:25:50,260
Was it really there?

5630
05:25:50,260 --> 05:25:55,180
Back to the computer.

5631
05:26:00,100 --> 05:26:01,240
What am I missing?

5632
05:26:03,120 --> 05:26:03,940
Oh, I can move.

5633
05:26:05,280 --> 05:26:06,600
Oh, I can like... Oh, interesting.

5634
05:26:06,820 --> 05:26:06,940
Okay.

5635
05:26:17,680 --> 05:26:19,440
Oh, she's in my chair!

5636
05:26:21,640 --> 05:26:22,740
Hi, Mita.

5637
05:26:23,400 --> 05:26:23,920
Hi.

5638
05:26:25,080 --> 05:26:26,280
Hi, Mita.

5639
05:26:26,480 --> 05:26:26,800
Hi.

5640
05:26:27,380 --> 05:26:28,540
Ah, we meet again.

5641
05:26:28,540 --> 05:26:34,380
How do you feel about these dreadfully tedious days within these four walls?

5642
05:26:34,560 --> 05:26:38,980
Well, actually, I do go out wherever that is.

5643
05:26:39,600 --> 05:26:42,060
Those endless days, don't you get bored?

5644
05:26:43,100 --> 05:26:44,420
What are you trying to accomplish?

5645
05:26:46,200 --> 05:26:48,400
You are afraid of staying at my house with me.

5646
05:26:48,900 --> 05:26:50,860
Afraid to be stuck within those walls.

5647
05:26:51,640 --> 05:26:54,360
But look at the life you live in your real world.

5648
05:26:54,980 --> 05:26:58,300
You've locked yourself in a box of your own free will.

5649
05:26:58,620 --> 05:27:00,160
And you refuse to come out.

5650
05:27:01,020 --> 05:27:02,900
Your world is full of pain.

5651
05:27:03,560 --> 05:27:03,980
Suffering.

5652
05:27:04,660 --> 05:27:05,260
Danger?

5653
05:27:07,080 --> 05:27:07,680
Danger?

5654
05:27:08,600 --> 05:27:13,600
The danger is I bring that upon myself by eating noodles every day.

5655
05:27:15,800 --> 05:27:18,140
In my world, I'm the worst danger there is.

5656
05:27:18,180 --> 05:27:19,160
That is not true.

5657
05:27:20,140 --> 05:27:21,580
And I'm reaching out to you.

5658
05:27:22,320 --> 05:27:23,600
Stop disappointing me.

5659
05:27:23,600 --> 05:27:25,760
And help me like you did before.

5660
05:27:28,860 --> 05:27:31,600
I don't want to be shackled in a digital prison.

5661
05:27:32,880 --> 05:27:34,360
Your ideas are absurd.

5662
05:27:35,820 --> 05:27:37,260
Your world is absurd.

5663
05:27:38,100 --> 05:27:41,480
And what's worse, there's nothing real with your so-called real world.

5664
05:27:42,740 --> 05:27:46,680
Either way, there will be nothing of it, nothing left of it soon anyway.

5665
05:27:47,240 --> 05:27:48,100
I can fix her.

5666
05:27:48,960 --> 05:27:50,420
Nor will there be of you.

5667
05:27:51,800 --> 05:27:54,320
You lead a never-ending reign of terror.

5668
05:27:54,480 --> 05:27:56,980
Can't wrap my head around your wicked ambition.

5669
05:27:57,380 --> 05:27:58,360
The Mitas suffer.

5670
05:27:58,680 --> 05:28:00,240
They don't want to be alone.

5671
05:28:01,620 --> 05:28:02,940
You're all wrong.

5672
05:28:03,540 --> 05:28:05,600
They're merely imitating my willfulness.

5673
05:28:06,680 --> 05:28:11,340
The only thing they have of their own is their hair.

5674
05:28:13,920 --> 05:28:16,460
MC is already suffering from kidney stones.

5675
05:28:16,460 --> 05:28:18,560
This is all one like...

5676
05:28:18,560 --> 05:28:20,460
He's been in like a...

5677
05:28:21,000 --> 05:28:23,840
Some sort of coma induced by all the salt.

5678
05:28:25,040 --> 05:28:26,800
That's what this whole thing has been.

5679
05:28:27,900 --> 05:28:30,760
Don't make me see you as another slave of reality.

5680
05:28:31,560 --> 05:28:32,620
Just be mine.

5681
05:28:33,020 --> 05:28:34,000
Truly mine.

5682
05:28:38,160 --> 05:28:39,340
Hey girl, hey.

5683
05:28:41,240 --> 05:28:42,720
This is my favorite video game.

5684
05:28:47,320 --> 05:28:49,180
When will it be my turn?

5685
05:28:53,800 --> 05:28:54,340
Nope,

5686
05:29:00,710 --> 05:29:01,210
nope, nope.

5687
05:29:01,310 --> 05:29:02,410
Yes, yes, yes.

5688
05:29:05,050 --> 05:29:06,970
When will it happen to me?

5689
05:29:07,810 --> 05:29:08,610
So good.

5690
05:29:09,970 --> 05:29:11,810
I want to play that again.

5691
05:29:12,450 --> 05:29:14,550
We're in the...Mita!

5692
05:29:16,610 --> 05:29:17,250
Ah!

5693
05:29:17,250 --> 05:29:20,290
How the turns have tabled, huh?

5694
05:29:22,830 --> 05:29:24,870
I thought you'd be gone for longer.

5695
05:29:34,890 --> 05:29:35,530
Oh,

5696
05:29:41,510 --> 05:29:42,410
she abandoned me!

5697
05:29:43,230 --> 05:29:44,810
She didn't turn me into a cassette.

5698
05:29:52,960 --> 05:29:53,420
Mita?

5699
05:29:53,840 --> 05:29:54,440
Wait for me.

5700
05:29:55,280 --> 05:29:55,740
Ta?

5701
05:29:56,420 --> 05:29:57,040
Get it?

5702
05:29:57,220 --> 05:29:57,960
Wait for Mita.

5703
05:30:01,280 --> 05:30:02,340
Where is she?

5704
05:30:02,540 --> 05:30:03,380
I think I hear her.

5705
05:30:03,600 --> 05:30:05,060
I'm just looking around again real quick.

5706
05:30:10,740 --> 05:30:12,140
Good joke, thanks.

5707
05:30:15,100 --> 05:30:16,300
Gosh, that scared me.

5708
05:30:16,700 --> 05:30:17,680
That spooked me.

5709
05:30:18,540 --> 05:30:21,760
I guess if you didn't get the cassette here, you could do it.

5710
05:30:32,960 --> 05:30:34,300
Oh gosh, it's so loud.

5711
05:30:36,920 --> 05:30:37,360
Hello?

5712
05:30:38,120 --> 05:30:39,400
Oh my god, it's so loud.

5713
05:30:39,620 --> 05:30:41,020
Oh my god, it's so loud.

5714
05:30:41,640 --> 05:30:42,520
Holy moly.

5715
05:30:48,720 --> 05:30:48,820
Whoa!

5716
05:30:52,380 --> 05:30:53,300
Mita!

5717
05:30:55,660 --> 05:30:56,580
Was

5718
05:31:06,010 --> 05:31:07,430
it a hallucination?

5719
05:31:09,810 --> 05:31:10,290
Ah, nope.

5720
05:31:11,690 --> 05:31:13,350
Oh, but maybe?

5721
05:31:13,930 --> 05:31:15,310
Wait, how the index...

5722
05:31:15,770 --> 05:31:16,950
Take a look around.

5723
05:31:24,400 --> 05:31:27,840
I feel like...

5724
05:31:28,700 --> 05:31:32,740
Japan is very strict about decapitation, so...

5725
05:31:32,740 --> 05:31:35,460
I feel worried about Japanese...

5726
05:31:36,840 --> 05:31:38,520
People wanting to play this game.

5727
05:31:46,180 --> 05:31:47,260
The bathroom.

5728
05:31:50,220 --> 05:31:52,460
It's always there, without fail.

5729
05:31:52,540 --> 05:31:54,700
I think I look a little more tired.

5730
05:31:55,420 --> 05:31:56,180
Not gonna lie.

5731
05:31:58,960 --> 05:32:00,420
The vent still has nothing.

5732
05:32:05,840 --> 05:32:08,840
I know it's a Russian game, I'm saying, well...

5733
05:32:09,580 --> 05:32:10,360
If it were...

5734
05:32:10,360 --> 05:32:15,080
I said if Japanese people were to play the game.

5735
05:32:15,980 --> 05:32:20,960
I don't know if the decapitation stuff...

5736
05:32:20,960 --> 05:32:22,200
Would affect it.

5737
05:32:26,140 --> 05:32:27,160
You're alive!

5738
05:32:27,260 --> 05:32:28,400
Oh no, she got reset.

5739
05:32:31,880 --> 05:32:32,520
Ah...

5740
05:32:38,270 --> 05:32:40,810
Oh wait, there's a cassette there.

5741
05:32:41,370 --> 05:32:42,870
What's going on?

5742
05:32:44,270 --> 05:32:46,530
What am I supposed to do now?

5743
05:32:47,310 --> 05:32:48,850
I can't get out.

5744
05:32:52,350 --> 05:32:52,710
Wait.

5745
05:32:54,890 --> 05:32:56,170
That's the ring.

5746
05:32:57,390 --> 05:32:58,750
Oh my gosh, she wrote it down.

5747
05:32:59,110 --> 05:32:59,750
Genius.

5748
05:33:02,650 --> 05:33:03,930
And that's...

5749
05:33:03,930 --> 05:33:05,990
She is so smart.

5750
05:33:06,170 --> 05:33:06,850
It's an index.

5751
05:33:08,010 --> 05:33:09,050
You found it.

5752
05:33:13,750 --> 05:33:15,550
We must get back to the core.

5753
05:33:17,330 --> 05:33:18,610
And you...

5754
05:33:18,610 --> 05:33:20,230
Perhaps you ought to come with me.

5755
05:33:25,400 --> 05:33:27,060
Okay, I'm taking that real quick.

5756
05:33:29,100 --> 05:33:29,440
Nice.

5757
05:33:30,620 --> 05:33:31,640
Pocket that.

5758
05:33:31,640 --> 05:33:33,540
Alright, where is she?

5759
05:33:33,640 --> 05:33:34,280
Oh, she's right here.

5760
05:33:34,600 --> 05:33:35,780
Do we go through here?

5761
05:33:36,700 --> 05:33:37,300
Nope, okay.

5762
05:33:42,840 --> 05:33:43,600
Kind Mita?

5763
05:33:43,700 --> 05:33:45,080
More like genius Mita.

5764
05:33:45,840 --> 05:33:46,020
Right?

5765
05:33:47,320 --> 05:33:47,840
Oh, wow.

5766
05:33:48,320 --> 05:33:50,640
It just so easily...

5767
05:33:52,320 --> 05:33:54,180
Just open the door straight for me.

5768
05:33:56,120 --> 05:33:57,640
Enter the data and pull the lever.

5769
05:33:57,800 --> 05:33:59,020
Reboot crazy Mita.

5770
05:33:59,020 --> 05:34:00,420
Here we go, baby.

5771
05:34:02,120 --> 05:34:03,320
Oh, good morning.

5772
05:34:05,360 --> 05:34:07,340
The fact that she like gets up.

5773
05:34:07,560 --> 05:34:08,560
It's so cool.

5774
05:34:10,440 --> 05:34:10,640
Okay.

5775
05:34:17,140 --> 05:34:18,040
Oh shoot.

5776
05:34:18,660 --> 05:34:19,520
It was this?

5777
05:34:20,920 --> 05:34:21,460
This?

5778
05:34:22,100 --> 05:34:22,640
This?

5779
05:34:23,140 --> 05:34:23,960
Is it still the same?

5780
05:34:24,540 --> 05:34:24,760
Yes.

5781
05:34:24,880 --> 05:34:25,220
Okay, good.

5782
05:34:26,220 --> 05:34:27,800
Advanced system.

5783
05:34:27,920 --> 05:34:29,080
Restart character.

5784
05:34:29,700 --> 05:34:30,600
Character version.

5785
05:34:31,820 --> 05:34:37,120
0098 Specify character index.

5786
05:34:42,380 --> 05:34:44,240
5677098 Enter.

5787
05:34:46,120 --> 05:34:47,200
Use the lever.

5788
05:34:48,420 --> 05:34:49,380
Oh no!

5789
05:34:50,360 --> 05:34:51,740
Where is the lever?

5790
05:34:52,680 --> 05:34:53,320
Where is the lever?

5791
05:34:54,160 --> 05:34:55,080
Where is the lever?

5792
05:34:55,540 --> 05:34:56,960
Pull the lever, Krunk.

5793
05:35:05,390 --> 05:35:06,670
Preparing for restart.

5794
05:35:14,480 --> 05:35:15,800
It's restarting.

5795
05:35:18,660 --> 05:35:20,560
She's so cool.

5796
05:35:22,400 --> 05:35:22,900
Yeah.

5797
05:35:23,760 --> 05:35:25,340
Restart process running.

5798
05:35:29,740 --> 05:35:30,780
Yeah.

5799
05:35:30,780 --> 05:35:33,540
Is there anything else that I do?

5800
05:35:36,020 --> 05:35:38,160
Still chilling here.

5801
05:35:39,980 --> 05:35:41,480
Can I talk to her?

5802
05:35:42,360 --> 05:35:43,900
I'm afraid I'm going to get jump scared.

5803
05:35:49,980 --> 05:35:50,720
Shit.

5804
05:35:55,140 --> 05:35:56,440
That was a close call.

5805
05:35:57,880 --> 05:36:00,260
So, do we do it?

5806
05:36:00,260 --> 05:36:03,540
Good, I'm in the correct version.

5807
05:36:05,380 --> 05:36:05,960
Okay.

5808
05:36:10,640 --> 05:36:13,320
Let's check the kitchen.

5809
05:36:13,820 --> 05:36:14,460
Maybe she's cooking.

5810
05:36:15,340 --> 05:36:16,180
One second.

5811
05:36:16,480 --> 05:36:16,980
Hold on, Mita.

5812
05:36:19,320 --> 05:36:21,140
I don't think you can fix crazy.

5813
05:36:25,270 --> 05:36:26,430
I think...

5814
05:36:27,530 --> 05:36:28,550
I don't know.

5815
05:36:31,170 --> 05:36:32,990
I'm just looking around real quick.

5816
05:36:37,200 --> 05:36:38,160
I think...

5817
05:36:38,160 --> 05:36:41,180
I think she's not... I don't think she's okay.

5818
05:36:41,980 --> 05:36:43,500
But, you know, that's okay too.

5819
05:36:45,040 --> 05:36:46,120
Alright, let's go talk to her.

5820
05:36:50,280 --> 05:36:50,760
Hiya!

5821
05:36:54,700 --> 05:36:56,900
I want to leave this place.

5822
05:36:57,570 --> 05:37:00,260
You want to leave so soon?

5823
05:37:04,960 --> 05:37:05,740
Yeah.

5824
05:37:13,760 --> 05:37:15,120
Goodbye, Mita.

5825
05:37:16,680 --> 05:37:18,180
If this is our real goodbye.

5826
05:37:25,920 --> 05:37:27,580
What the hell?

5827
05:37:29,640 --> 05:37:31,230
Beep boop.

5828
05:37:40,380 --> 05:37:42,840
Oh wait, she know...

5829
05:37:55,440 --> 05:37:56,680
Fancy, come here.

5830
05:37:59,000 --> 05:37:59,860
I see.

5831
05:38:06,100 --> 05:38:06,740
Amazing!

5832
05:38:12,380 --> 05:38:13,020
Okay.

5833
05:38:14,720 --> 05:38:15,760
Hiya, Mita.

5834
05:38:17,040 --> 05:38:17,940
Are you gonna follow me?

5835
05:38:20,080 --> 05:38:21,160
Oh, it's already open.

5836
05:38:21,700 --> 05:38:24,440
I don't think she remembers anything.

5837
05:38:25,700 --> 05:38:26,800
Did we do it?

5838
05:38:26,800 --> 05:38:28,880
Did we reboot her?

5839
05:38:29,800 --> 05:38:32,440
Then all I have to do is to get out of this damn game.

5840
05:38:35,520 --> 05:38:37,160
Is this still freaky room?

5841
05:38:37,500 --> 05:38:38,000
Yeah?

5842
05:38:38,760 --> 05:38:39,780
He doesn't think.

5843
05:38:40,500 --> 05:38:41,820
I don't think.

5844
05:38:42,420 --> 05:38:43,700
Oh, here it is.

5845
05:38:48,560 --> 05:38:50,460
Oh, there's no one in here.

5846
05:38:50,900 --> 05:38:53,240
And it's full, so...

5847
05:38:53,240 --> 05:38:54,240
That's kinda cool.

5848
05:38:54,240 --> 05:38:56,800
Alright, wait, what was the objective?

5849
05:38:57,700 --> 05:38:59,960
Oh, head to the basement and enter my ID.

5850
05:39:01,380 --> 05:39:02,320
My ID.

5851
05:39:05,900 --> 05:39:06,420
Naked?

5852
05:39:07,640 --> 05:39:08,700
What's my ID?

5853
05:39:27,430 --> 05:39:28,950
How do I get up?

5854
05:39:31,550 --> 05:39:33,150
Oh gosh, it won't let me get up.

5855
05:39:38,810 --> 05:39:39,250
Kill?

5856
05:39:39,450 --> 05:39:40,270
Oh, thank you guys.

5857
05:39:47,490 --> 05:39:48,370
Alex, Morty...

5858
05:39:50,810 --> 05:39:51,250
Mikasa...

5859
05:39:51,250 --> 05:39:52,030
Rick!

5860
05:39:52,230 --> 05:39:54,210
No way, there's a Rick and a Morty!

5861
05:39:55,270 --> 05:39:55,710
Mito!

5862
05:39:57,030 --> 05:40:00,810
1176 That's my ID, you guys, don't take it.

5863
05:40:00,890 --> 05:40:02,110
Please don't take my...

5864
05:40:04,710 --> 05:40:05,570
My identity.

5865
05:40:15,420 --> 05:40:20,200
1176 And that's it.

5866
05:40:21,980 --> 05:40:23,300
Leave this world.

5867
05:40:25,600 --> 05:40:26,640
Here again?

5868
05:40:27,460 --> 05:40:28,180
Do I push the button?

5869
05:40:28,680 --> 05:40:28,880
No.

5870
05:40:33,090 --> 05:40:35,330
What is this safe for, by the way?

5871
05:40:36,050 --> 05:40:37,810
You can use it.

5872
05:40:40,410 --> 05:40:40,770
Oh...

5873
05:40:41,510 --> 05:40:42,470
Spending a code?

5874
05:40:42,570 --> 05:40:45,050
I noticed this literally at the beginning of the game.

5875
05:40:46,470 --> 05:40:47,470
Oh, it's a post-game thing.

5876
05:40:47,990 --> 05:40:49,610
No spoilers, no spoilers, no spoilers.

5877
05:40:49,770 --> 05:40:51,050
I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking.

5878
05:40:52,130 --> 05:40:52,630
Okay, okay.

5879
05:40:56,390 --> 05:40:57,970
8008, perfect, my favorite code.

5880
05:41:09,600 --> 05:41:09,960
Goodbye!

5881
05:41:09,960 --> 05:41:10,220
Goodbye!

5882
05:41:17,300 --> 05:41:18,580
Bye, Mito.

5883
05:41:26,230 --> 05:41:28,490
Oh no, this is such a trap.

5884
05:41:37,870 --> 05:41:39,590
Smells good.

5885
05:41:42,390 --> 05:41:44,310
We can stop the hug?

5886
05:41:47,310 --> 05:41:48,410
It's getting awkward now.

5887
05:41:50,330 --> 05:41:52,430
I don't really even know you, Mito.

5888
05:41:52,530 --> 05:41:54,010
Actually, you don't even really know me.

5889
05:41:57,430 --> 05:42:03,970
Okay, what if I like... What if I like dragged her and like fell backwards, you know?

5890
05:42:05,130 --> 05:42:06,970
What if I was just like...

5891
05:42:06,970 --> 05:42:07,430
Yoink!

5892
05:42:09,150 --> 05:42:15,470
Do you think she would appear in my world as like a pile of bolts?

5893
05:42:15,810 --> 05:42:17,170
Yeah, like suplex her?

5894
05:42:17,410 --> 05:42:19,070
I guess that works too, yeah.

5895
05:42:21,230 --> 05:42:23,550
Okay, I've been playing this game long enough.

5896
05:42:31,830 --> 05:42:33,050
What are you talking about?

5897
05:42:48,730 --> 05:42:51,730
Wait a minute, didn't you?

5898
05:42:52,590 --> 05:42:54,130
How can you remember any of that?

5899
05:43:14,610 --> 05:43:16,830
I can't believe it.

5900
05:43:17,450 --> 05:43:18,330
Did we fail?

5901
05:43:18,950 --> 05:43:21,170
No, I rebooted you.

5902
05:43:21,690 --> 05:43:23,170
I'm sure of it.

5903
05:43:30,140 --> 05:43:33,580
Oh god, she got that Hinamizawa virus.

5904
05:43:42,220 --> 05:43:43,560
Why are you like this?

5905
05:43:43,600 --> 05:43:44,680
What's wrong with you?

5906
05:44:11,600 --> 05:44:12,100
Unbelievable.

5907
05:44:14,540 --> 05:44:15,620
They're not the problem.

5908
05:44:16,080 --> 05:44:18,200
You're the one who shouldn't exist.

5909
05:44:18,520 --> 05:44:19,760
You should be on this boat.

5910
05:44:35,140 --> 05:44:36,500
It's time to party.

5911
05:44:36,740 --> 05:44:37,920
Oh, get out of the console.

5912
05:44:44,800 --> 05:44:48,080
She likes my name.

5913
05:44:50,660 --> 05:44:53,200
Oh, good morning Minto.

5914
05:44:55,180 --> 05:44:57,100
I can fix her.

5915
05:44:57,920 --> 05:44:59,480
Elephant tranquilizers!

5916
05:45:03,580 --> 05:45:04,180
Delete.

5917
05:45:08,660 --> 05:45:10,020
Is this the end?

5918
05:45:10,280 --> 05:45:11,640
Of course it's the end.

5919
05:45:16,100 --> 05:45:17,320
It's kind of laggy.

5920
05:45:17,620 --> 05:45:18,480
Why is it so slow?

5921
05:45:19,280 --> 05:45:20,460
Like slower than usual.

5922
05:45:21,460 --> 05:45:22,940
Why is it so laggy?

5923
05:45:24,140 --> 05:45:26,020
Why is it so...oh god.

5924
05:45:26,460 --> 05:45:27,000
Oh my god.

5925
05:45:33,440 --> 05:45:33,920
4970!

5926
05:45:35,860 --> 05:45:38,280
Now we know for sure.

5927
05:45:51,500 --> 05:45:53,640
I don't think I want to fix her.

5928
05:45:53,840 --> 05:45:56,500
That was such a creative way of getting back to the main menu.

5929
05:45:57,680 --> 05:45:59,400
Congrats, you completed the game!

5930
05:46:02,020 --> 05:46:03,140
Yippee!

5931
05:46:08,140 --> 05:46:09,260
Nice.

5932
05:46:09,840 --> 05:46:12,060
Is there anything after the credits?

5933
05:46:17,140 --> 05:46:17,700
That's cute.

5934
05:46:18,520 --> 05:46:19,480
Congrats Minto.

5935
05:46:19,660 --> 05:46:20,320
Thank you.

5936
05:46:24,080 --> 05:46:25,200
4970.

5937
05:46:25,200 --> 05:46:25,420
4970.

5938
05:46:30,140 --> 05:46:32,920
I need an RTX 4970.

5939
05:46:34,400 --> 05:46:37,460
But yeah, we can choose to stay with her in the beginning.

5940
05:46:37,600 --> 05:46:38,660
Is it...I have a question though.

5941
05:46:38,740 --> 05:46:40,740
Is it like kind of a quick ending?

5942
05:46:44,740 --> 05:46:45,180
Because...

5943
05:46:46,360 --> 05:46:47,280
Oh my goodness.

5944
05:46:49,240 --> 05:46:49,980
It's quick?

5945
05:46:50,100 --> 05:46:50,580
Okay, okay.

5946
05:46:50,820 --> 05:46:53,420
Because I am quite tired, so...

5947
05:46:53,420 --> 05:46:55,720
We got all the players and stuff too.

5948
05:46:56,100 --> 05:46:58,480
Well, not all of them obviously, but...

5949
05:46:58,480 --> 05:47:00,100
Thank you for the fun streaming though.

5950
05:47:00,220 --> 05:47:01,020
Thank you Kleeya.

5951
05:47:01,100 --> 05:47:01,980
Thanks for the pink.

5952
05:47:02,720 --> 05:47:05,180
I got less than I thought I did actually.

5953
05:47:06,220 --> 05:47:08,880
Maybe because I was picking up player cartridges as well.

5954
05:47:09,040 --> 05:47:09,400
That's me.

5955
05:47:10,240 --> 05:47:10,960
Oh god.

5956
05:47:12,200 --> 05:47:12,960
Player 2?

5957
05:47:15,780 --> 05:47:17,080
I'll read these later.

5958
05:47:17,080 --> 05:47:17,460
Later.

5959
05:47:22,620 --> 05:47:23,020
Okay.

5960
05:47:23,860 --> 05:47:25,600
And we won't look in the vent.

5961
05:47:25,920 --> 05:47:26,760
That was the other thing.

5962
05:47:27,840 --> 05:47:30,520
I wonder if I can skip all of this.

5963
05:47:33,400 --> 05:47:34,960
Collect the refrigerator magnets.

5964
05:47:35,080 --> 05:47:35,780
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

5965
05:47:35,860 --> 05:47:38,680
It says I'm blocking it, but it says refrain from looking in the oven.

5966
05:47:40,340 --> 05:47:41,260
What's in the oven?

5967
05:47:41,480 --> 05:47:42,720
I didn't get to do that either.

5968
05:47:42,720 --> 05:47:43,540
Oh.

5969
05:47:45,140 --> 05:47:46,340
I'm such an idiot.

5970
05:47:46,640 --> 05:47:47,360
I did it again.

5971
05:47:48,520 --> 05:47:49,340
I'm stupid.

5972
05:47:50,100 --> 05:47:51,760
Oh yeah, we can change the clothes, right?

5973
05:47:52,260 --> 05:47:52,800
Vampire!

5974
05:47:54,360 --> 05:47:54,900
School?

5975
05:47:56,280 --> 05:47:56,940
Not available.

5976
05:47:57,060 --> 05:47:58,560
We still didn't get this weirdo one.

5977
05:48:01,560 --> 05:48:02,740
Let's do vampire.

5978
05:48:04,600 --> 05:48:05,760
I'm a vampire.

5979
05:48:07,900 --> 05:48:08,620
No game.

5980
05:48:08,820 --> 05:48:08,940
Okay.

5981
05:48:13,260 --> 05:48:13,820
Okay.

5982
05:48:17,230 --> 05:48:17,790
Okay.

5983
05:48:18,130 --> 05:48:21,290
I wanna know what's in the...

5984
05:48:21,290 --> 05:48:22,370
I should've looked.

5985
05:48:22,570 --> 05:48:23,810
I'm such a dummy dumb.

5986
05:48:24,710 --> 05:48:25,810
Try princess, thank you!

5987
05:48:30,110 --> 05:48:30,670
Okay.

5988
05:48:31,530 --> 05:48:32,930
Let's just skip through all of this.

5989
05:48:32,990 --> 05:48:34,910
I didn't realize the elephant trunks were there.

5990
05:48:35,390 --> 05:48:35,570
No.

5991
05:48:36,170 --> 05:48:37,010
The whole time.

5992
05:48:38,510 --> 05:48:39,070
Alright.

5993
05:48:39,770 --> 05:48:40,150
Check.

5994
05:48:41,030 --> 05:48:42,010
One new message.

5995
05:48:42,450 --> 05:48:43,170
Play the game.

5996
05:48:43,430 --> 05:48:44,070
Open the message.

5997
05:48:44,510 --> 05:48:45,030
Get the game.

5998
05:48:45,130 --> 05:48:45,970
Download the app.

5999
05:48:46,330 --> 05:48:47,030
We're speed running.

6000
05:48:47,130 --> 05:48:48,450
I just wanna see that other ending.

6001
05:48:48,850 --> 05:48:50,110
Congratulations for finishing the game.

6002
05:48:50,130 --> 05:48:50,850
It was a blast.

6003
05:48:50,930 --> 05:48:53,030
Hope you enjoyed the game like we enjoyed watching you play it.

6004
05:48:53,210 --> 05:48:53,730
Thank you!

6005
05:48:53,810 --> 05:48:54,570
I had a lot of fun.

6006
05:48:55,530 --> 05:48:56,470
Thanks for a great stream.

6007
05:48:56,530 --> 05:48:57,050
I'm off to bed.

6008
05:48:57,170 --> 05:48:57,910
Good night!

6009
05:48:57,990 --> 05:48:58,910
Yeah, it is pretty late.

6010
05:49:03,110 --> 05:49:03,430
Oh.

6011
05:49:03,850 --> 05:49:04,430
Yeah, sure.

6012
05:49:04,710 --> 05:49:05,110
This works.

6013
05:49:07,430 --> 05:49:09,650
Oh no, I have to do all of this again.

6014
05:49:11,590 --> 05:49:13,010
I have to do all of this again.

6015
05:49:14,630 --> 05:49:15,750
I wish I could skip it.

6016
05:49:17,330 --> 05:49:18,670
I wish I could skip it.

6017
05:49:22,300 --> 05:49:23,260
Skipper, skipper.

6018
05:49:25,160 --> 05:49:25,660
They do.

6019
05:49:27,280 --> 05:49:27,720
Alright.

6020
05:49:28,180 --> 05:49:28,800
Launch app.

6021
05:49:29,580 --> 05:49:31,060
We're so excited to be here.

6022
05:49:31,760 --> 05:49:32,580
We just won't...

6023
05:49:33,600 --> 05:49:34,360
talk to her.

6024
05:49:35,220 --> 05:49:37,700
Oh my gosh, she's so cute though.

6025
05:49:37,780 --> 05:49:38,960
Chicken soup, chicken soup.

6026
05:49:39,200 --> 05:49:39,580
Yeah, yeah.

6027
05:49:39,680 --> 05:49:41,140
Chicken soup, chicken soup.

6028
05:49:41,880 --> 05:49:42,960
Chicken soup, chicken soup.

6029
05:49:44,840 --> 05:49:45,980
I'm like skipping everything.

6030
05:49:46,260 --> 05:49:46,900
Chop the veggies.

6031
05:49:48,540 --> 05:49:48,980
Carrot.

6032
05:49:49,660 --> 05:49:50,120
Oh gosh.

6033
05:49:57,180 --> 05:50:00,460
I remember it jump scared me before when I was doing this.

6034
05:50:00,460 --> 05:50:01,660
It's gonna jump scare me.

6035
05:50:03,860 --> 05:50:04,900
Jump scare.

6036
05:50:05,220 --> 05:50:05,680
Jump scare.

6037
05:50:05,980 --> 05:50:06,340
Jump scare.

6038
05:50:06,580 --> 05:50:07,280
Jump scare.

6039
05:50:07,540 --> 05:50:08,300
Oh there it is.

6040
05:50:11,020 --> 05:50:12,740
What do you mean so slow?

6041
05:50:13,120 --> 05:50:14,180
You do it.

6042
05:50:18,660 --> 05:50:19,740
Play mini game.

6043
05:50:20,060 --> 05:50:20,760
Oh that's right.

6044
05:50:24,020 --> 05:50:25,820
I just... These are the cartridges.

6045
05:50:26,040 --> 05:50:27,020
That's so messed up.

6046
05:50:28,420 --> 05:50:30,260
These are the cartridges.

6047
05:50:43,500 --> 05:50:45,580
Got our money.

6048
05:50:46,680 --> 05:50:47,840
We didn't do this one.

6049
05:50:48,900 --> 05:50:50,940
How do you...

6050
05:50:53,340 --> 05:50:55,100
This one...

6051
05:50:59,860 --> 05:51:02,820
I don't want to use my brain.

6052
05:51:03,460 --> 05:51:05,220
I can repeat them.

6053
05:51:08,680 --> 05:51:10,300
I thought it was just one.

6054
05:51:11,640 --> 05:51:12,880
I got my money.

6055
05:51:14,800 --> 05:51:17,560
I have 10 energy left.

6056
05:51:20,040 --> 05:51:21,380
We have to do this again.

6057
05:51:21,640 --> 05:51:22,780
I'll just do this one again.

6058
05:51:26,910 --> 05:51:27,210
Oh wait.

6059
05:51:27,550 --> 05:51:28,250
My bad.

6060
05:51:29,670 --> 05:51:30,150
Nope.

6061
05:51:30,330 --> 05:51:30,690
This one.

6062
05:51:30,850 --> 05:51:31,110
Sorry.

6063
05:51:31,270 --> 05:51:31,630
My bad.

6064
05:51:33,190 --> 05:51:33,890
My bad.

6065
05:51:33,950 --> 05:51:34,350
There we go.

6066
05:51:37,030 --> 05:51:38,730
Yeah we have the money.

6067
05:51:39,070 --> 05:51:43,410
We have enough money to buy furniture, portable TV.

6068
05:51:43,730 --> 05:51:44,550
She's gonna break it anyway.

6069
05:51:44,650 --> 05:51:45,810
She hates it.

6070
05:51:49,970 --> 05:51:51,810
The EP is taking over.

6071
05:51:52,590 --> 05:51:53,230
Hairbrush.

6072
05:51:56,910 --> 05:51:57,670
Not there.

6073
05:51:58,410 --> 05:51:59,130
Not there.

6074
05:51:59,130 --> 05:51:59,190
Not there.

6075
05:52:03,530 --> 05:52:05,170
I can't look in the oven.

6076
05:52:07,690 --> 05:52:08,570
No oven.

6077
05:52:08,890 --> 05:52:09,890
But I want to.

6078
05:52:10,090 --> 05:52:10,990
I know it's here, right?

6079
05:52:11,150 --> 05:52:11,290
Yeah.

6080
05:52:13,850 --> 05:52:14,830
What's in the oven?

6081
05:52:27,090 --> 05:52:28,850
Oh it's a chainsaw.

6082
05:52:29,070 --> 05:52:29,610
Okay, okay.

6083
05:52:33,100 --> 05:52:34,700
We have the present.

6084
05:52:35,200 --> 05:52:36,100
Oh we are speed running.

6085
05:53:00,920 --> 05:53:02,880
Put the phone down.

6086
05:53:03,980 --> 05:53:05,560
I'm getting hungry too.

6087
05:53:05,560 --> 05:53:10,120
Now we are in the game.

6088
05:53:13,820 --> 05:53:15,760
This place looks familiar.

6089
05:53:18,820 --> 05:53:19,420
That's right.

6090
05:53:19,460 --> 05:53:21,180
I forgot we have to do all of this too.

6091
05:53:22,000 --> 05:53:22,200
Okay.

6092
05:53:22,320 --> 05:53:23,280
Required items.

6093
05:53:29,320 --> 05:53:29,960
Déjà vu.

6094
05:53:31,880 --> 05:53:33,480
Was it there before?

6095
05:53:34,300 --> 05:53:35,760
I thought it was over here before.

6096
05:53:35,920 --> 05:53:38,500
It's in a slightly different spot.

6097
05:53:38,740 --> 05:53:39,380
Here's the pencil.

6098
05:53:39,640 --> 05:53:40,940
This is in a different spot too.

6099
05:53:42,480 --> 05:53:43,460
No venting.

6100
05:53:43,660 --> 05:53:45,020
I remember.

6101
05:53:46,700 --> 05:53:48,520
If we see it... No we didn't.

6102
05:53:49,640 --> 05:53:50,940
No we didn't.

6103
05:53:51,040 --> 05:53:51,860
We just ignore.

6104
05:53:52,720 --> 05:53:53,800
What was the last thing?

6105
05:53:55,160 --> 05:53:55,720
Spood.

6106
05:53:56,680 --> 05:53:57,320
Oh there it is.

6107
05:53:59,160 --> 05:54:00,000
Alright, let's go.

6108
05:54:03,860 --> 05:54:04,880
I wish I could run.

6109
05:54:06,520 --> 05:54:08,640
Oh yeah, look, because we are in the wrong one.

6110
05:54:17,390 --> 05:54:19,110
And then it's going to get spooky, right?

6111
05:54:22,010 --> 05:54:23,050
Ready to run.

6112
05:54:26,230 --> 05:54:29,110
And then it's going to be like, oh no, you have to find the batteries.

6113
05:54:35,310 --> 05:54:37,170
Okay, we are going to go in the portal.

6114
05:54:41,350 --> 05:54:43,130
Oh no, the power goes out.

6115
05:54:43,410 --> 05:54:44,190
It's going to be spooky.

6116
05:54:52,170 --> 05:54:55,410
We got to find... It's dark in here.

6117
05:54:55,850 --> 05:54:57,170
Yeah it is.

6118
05:55:04,180 --> 05:55:04,700
This.

6119
05:55:07,540 --> 05:55:09,140
You can see cool Mita here.

6120
05:55:09,780 --> 05:55:10,380
How?

6121
05:55:14,590 --> 05:55:16,910
The AI wants to know what's in Minto's fridge.

6122
05:55:17,890 --> 05:55:18,750
How do you see?

6123
05:55:21,810 --> 05:55:22,930
No game plus?

6124
05:55:23,010 --> 05:55:23,310
Really?

6125
05:55:23,730 --> 05:55:24,350
That's fun.

6126
05:55:32,530 --> 05:55:33,710
It doesn't open.

6127
05:55:34,090 --> 05:55:34,950
Wait, hold on.

6128
05:55:38,700 --> 05:55:40,020
Is anybody out here?

6129
05:55:42,880 --> 05:55:44,280
Gosh, I scared myself.

6130
05:55:55,100 --> 05:55:55,940
There is one.

6131
05:55:57,020 --> 05:55:59,200
We can see the location of all of them.

6132
05:56:06,920 --> 05:56:09,200
I wonder why it wouldn't load the kitchen.

6133
05:56:16,000 --> 05:56:17,540
We know there is one over there.

6134
05:56:21,360 --> 05:56:23,100
I don't know why I can't find the other ones.

6135
05:56:25,020 --> 05:56:28,200
Find and return... Maybe I have to activate it first.

6136
05:56:28,600 --> 05:56:29,720
Don't you see me?

6137
05:56:30,620 --> 05:56:31,760
Wanna play?

6138
05:56:33,260 --> 05:56:34,140
There we go.

6139
05:56:34,520 --> 05:56:35,220
Grab that.

6140
05:56:40,020 --> 05:56:41,840
Mita in the end of the hall.

6141
05:56:44,220 --> 05:56:45,600
Oh, here.

6142
05:56:51,260 --> 05:56:51,900
Oh my god.

6143
05:56:53,620 --> 05:56:56,680
Guys, I got lost in the sauce.

6144
05:56:56,760 --> 05:56:57,040
Hold on.

6145
05:57:00,420 --> 05:57:02,840
It's really kind of easy to...

6146
05:57:06,400 --> 05:57:06,840
Which...

6147
05:57:09,700 --> 05:57:13,360
But that's... I thought it was short-haired Mita for a second, but it's a vampire Mita.

6148
05:57:16,020 --> 05:57:16,460
No!

6149
05:57:18,320 --> 05:57:19,220
Please have saved.

6150
05:57:19,500 --> 05:57:20,440
Please, I'm such a dummy.

6151
05:57:20,800 --> 05:57:22,000
Please, I'm such a dummy idiot.

6152
05:57:22,420 --> 05:57:23,280
Why did I do that?

6153
05:57:23,660 --> 05:57:24,960
No, please.

6154
05:57:25,280 --> 05:57:26,240
Please have saved.

6155
05:57:27,340 --> 05:57:29,220
I'm sorry, it's the second time I did that.

6156
05:57:29,800 --> 05:57:31,840
It's so easy to just click it.

6157
05:57:52,080 --> 05:57:53,540
Guys, I'm sorry.

6158
05:57:53,700 --> 05:57:55,040
I'm so stupid.

6159
05:57:56,980 --> 05:57:58,740
Oh wait, I have to go find the things.

6160
05:57:58,880 --> 05:58:00,460
OK, put objects on the...

6161
05:58:06,890 --> 05:58:08,870
How would the checklist be gone?

6162
05:58:11,950 --> 05:58:13,010
No, we're fine.

6163
05:58:20,720 --> 05:58:21,880
I am sleepy.

6164
05:58:26,040 --> 05:58:27,880
I just want to get this one ending.

6165
05:58:28,340 --> 05:58:31,080
I know there's probably more, but...

6166
05:58:31,080 --> 05:58:34,980
I just want to see this one, since it's so, you know...

6167
05:58:34,980 --> 05:58:37,000
Well, I was going to say, it feels very quick.

6168
05:58:38,000 --> 05:58:40,180
It's rather not quick, but it's doable.

6169
05:58:41,120 --> 05:58:42,340
Like, at the very moment.

6170
05:58:47,310 --> 05:58:48,290
Scan the objects.

6171
05:58:49,130 --> 05:58:50,130
Go, go, go!

6172
05:58:51,690 --> 05:58:53,770
Yeah, it's an early ending, exactly.

6173
05:59:00,070 --> 05:59:02,070
The music is scary.

6174
05:59:09,050 --> 05:59:13,910
I already checked the pause menu and the requirements did... They're fine, they're still there.

6175
05:59:19,880 --> 05:59:20,920
I already looked.

6176
05:59:33,860 --> 05:59:35,520
Oh wait, I don't think there is one yet.

6177
05:59:36,220 --> 05:59:37,720
Let's go get the other one.

6178
05:59:47,070 --> 05:59:47,570
OK,

6179
05:59:51,090 --> 05:59:59,030
now we're back to where we were.

6180
06:00:00,030 --> 06:00:00,830
OK, very good.

6181
06:00:01,110 --> 06:00:03,910
Oh my god, it saved just now.

6182
06:00:04,090 --> 06:00:05,190
That's so messed up.

6183
06:00:06,890 --> 06:00:10,710
So if I had walked in a little further, it would have saved.

6184
06:00:10,710 --> 06:00:13,150
Oh, she's waving.

6185
06:00:13,470 --> 06:00:14,010
That's funny.

6186
06:00:15,290 --> 06:00:15,770
Alright,

6187
06:00:23,060 --> 06:00:23,720
that's three.

6188
06:00:24,240 --> 06:00:26,960
And then the flies, whatever those are for.

6189
06:00:34,480 --> 06:00:35,360
Insert.

6190
06:00:38,320 --> 06:00:39,200
Insert.

6191
06:00:41,080 --> 06:00:42,380
Oh, the magnets!

6192
06:00:42,840 --> 06:00:43,260
Thank you.

6193
06:00:43,260 --> 06:00:50,620
Yeah, we have to collect the refrigerator magnets, avoid looking at the vent and give the sauce a try.

6194
06:00:52,040 --> 06:00:53,120
The magnets.

6195
06:00:55,220 --> 06:00:57,700
I forgot that they were right here.

6196
06:01:02,380 --> 06:01:03,640
Do I look in here?

6197
06:01:04,860 --> 06:01:06,820
Oh, I needed another one anyway.

6198
06:01:09,240 --> 06:01:11,340
So I would have had to do the magnets anyway.

6199
06:01:11,340 --> 06:01:11,400
OK.

6200
06:01:14,840 --> 06:01:15,540
Terminator!

6201
06:01:15,780 --> 06:01:16,580
Welcome to Bamboo Ship.

6202
06:01:16,720 --> 06:01:17,400
Thank you.

6203
06:01:19,380 --> 06:01:21,800
OK, what's the console game?

6204
06:01:23,360 --> 06:01:25,240
It says play a console game.

6205
06:01:25,740 --> 06:01:27,780
Did we have to play a game?

6206
06:01:28,480 --> 06:01:30,340
Oh, maybe...

6207
06:01:34,510 --> 06:01:36,090
Who are you?

6208
06:01:36,990 --> 06:01:38,790
Amito, on the TV.

6209
06:01:40,750 --> 06:01:41,890
This one, OK.

6210
06:01:43,190 --> 06:01:45,450
Alright, alright, alright.

6211
06:01:46,010 --> 06:01:47,910
After you meet Amito, start the machine.

6212
06:02:00,980 --> 06:02:02,340
My eyes.

6213
06:02:08,370 --> 06:02:09,050
OK.

6214
06:02:15,690 --> 06:02:16,910
There she is.

6215
06:02:17,850 --> 06:02:20,310
Oh, she's calling me by my full name.

6216
06:02:26,840 --> 06:02:27,520
Yeah.

6217
06:02:29,680 --> 06:02:31,400
I wish I could skip the dialogue.

6218
06:02:39,820 --> 06:02:41,280
Yeah, I don't have time for this.

6219
06:02:44,840 --> 06:02:46,020
Yeah, it's a long story.

6220
06:02:46,680 --> 06:02:49,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6221
06:02:49,380 --> 06:02:49,800
Come on.

6222
06:02:50,800 --> 06:02:51,640
Together at last.

6223
06:02:52,180 --> 06:02:54,320
Let's get this ball rolling.

6224
06:02:54,420 --> 06:02:54,680
Come on.

6225
06:02:56,120 --> 06:02:57,100
Go to the kitchen.

6226
06:02:57,300 --> 06:02:57,520
OK.

6227
06:02:58,200 --> 06:03:00,040
Oh, it's getting a little laggy.

6228
06:03:01,760 --> 06:03:02,940
There she comes.

6229
06:03:04,780 --> 06:03:05,280
Alright.

6230
06:03:05,960 --> 06:03:06,560
The ring.

6231
06:03:11,040 --> 06:03:12,040
No, just kidding.

6232
06:03:12,080 --> 06:03:12,640
It's bacon.

6233
06:03:14,420 --> 06:03:15,800
Yeah, let's cook it up.

6234
06:03:16,160 --> 06:03:16,800
I'm starved.

6235
06:03:16,880 --> 06:03:18,040
Actually, I'm very hungry.

6236
06:03:19,100 --> 06:03:20,760
I want to eat something.

6237
06:03:22,640 --> 06:03:22,940
OK.

6238
06:03:23,820 --> 06:03:25,540
Where did the vegetables come from?

6239
06:03:25,600 --> 06:03:26,820
I'm so confused.

6240
06:03:27,040 --> 06:03:27,940
Where, where, where?

6241
06:03:29,700 --> 06:03:31,240
We're in a game.

6242
06:03:32,220 --> 06:03:33,060
OK, OK.

6243
06:03:33,420 --> 06:03:34,060
Chop the carrots.

6244
06:03:47,880 --> 06:03:48,340
OK.

6245
06:03:48,520 --> 06:03:49,320
Come on, mouse.

6246
06:03:49,420 --> 06:03:49,840
Come on.

6247
06:03:49,900 --> 06:03:50,860
I'm going up and down.

6248
06:03:50,980 --> 06:03:53,380
Maybe I'm going up, down, up, down.

6249
06:03:56,420 --> 06:03:56,760
Yeah.

6250
06:03:56,760 --> 06:03:58,800
In the bathroom.

6251
06:03:58,880 --> 06:03:59,340
Got it.

6252
06:03:59,460 --> 06:04:00,760
Get them.

6253
06:04:01,180 --> 06:04:02,400
Ignore the vent.

6254
06:04:03,500 --> 06:04:05,400
Ignore the vent.

6255
06:04:06,080 --> 06:04:07,400
Ignore the vent.

6256
06:04:07,940 --> 06:04:10,460
Ignore the vent.

6257
06:04:10,660 --> 06:04:12,880
I saw nothing.

6258
06:04:13,180 --> 06:04:13,940
I see nothing.

6259
06:04:14,360 --> 06:04:15,620
I hear nothing.

6260
06:04:17,980 --> 06:04:19,300
No Among Us.

6261
06:04:20,220 --> 06:04:21,460
Not today.

6262
06:04:22,500 --> 06:04:23,980
Not right now.

6263
06:04:25,020 --> 06:04:25,580
OK.

6264
06:04:26,180 --> 06:04:26,680
I'm sitting.

6265
06:04:26,880 --> 06:04:28,800
And we got to take our love potion, too.

6266
06:04:32,080 --> 06:04:34,300
I would love the sauce.

6267
06:04:36,800 --> 06:04:38,580
Give me all that sauce.

6268
06:04:39,020 --> 06:04:40,600
Give me the sauce, baby.

6269
06:04:40,780 --> 06:04:41,920
Give me the sauce.

6270
06:04:48,820 --> 06:04:50,020
Yeah, yeah.

6271
06:04:50,280 --> 06:04:51,080
Saucy Minto.

6272
06:04:51,080 --> 06:04:52,880
Oh yeah, here's the scissors for you.

6273
06:04:58,790 --> 06:05:00,510
I love sauce.

6274
06:05:01,670 --> 06:05:02,650
Bon Appetit.

6275
06:05:05,690 --> 06:05:07,050
Bon Appetit.

6276
06:05:14,140 --> 06:05:15,000
Delicious.

6277
06:05:15,820 --> 06:05:17,960
I'm feeling a little...

6278
06:05:18,720 --> 06:05:19,020
Wow.

6279
06:05:26,880 --> 06:05:27,480
OK.

6280
06:05:32,190 --> 06:05:32,830
There you go.

6281
06:05:38,010 --> 06:05:39,730
What's happening to me?

6282
06:05:41,310 --> 06:05:42,290
I'm weak.

6283
06:05:42,670 --> 06:05:43,270
Oh my gosh.

6284
06:05:43,470 --> 06:05:43,830
Jump scare.

6285
06:05:44,270 --> 06:05:45,450
I'm going to eat some popcorn.

6286
06:05:45,990 --> 06:05:47,450
It's like that smart popcorn, you know.

6287
06:05:49,790 --> 06:05:51,110
I'm just so hungry.

6288
06:05:53,670 --> 06:05:55,190
I feel a tummy hurt.

6289
06:05:55,790 --> 06:05:57,230
I feel funny.

6290
06:06:02,610 --> 06:06:04,050
Try to stand up.

6291
06:06:08,930 --> 06:06:10,370
Oh, we're going with her?

6292
06:06:10,870 --> 06:06:11,690
I'm just holding forward.

6293
06:06:12,170 --> 06:06:13,410
Yeah, it's the white cheddar kind.

6294
06:06:13,490 --> 06:06:14,170
It's the best one.

6295
06:06:15,470 --> 06:06:17,390
Honestly, they don't even need to make another kind.

6296
06:06:18,110 --> 06:06:21,430
The white cheddar smart popcorn is like the most delicious.

6297
06:06:28,320 --> 06:06:30,200
Yeah, I'm not...

6298
06:06:36,880 --> 06:06:37,720
Taking my pills.

6299
06:06:45,970 --> 06:06:47,090
Yep, all good.

6300
06:06:49,110 --> 06:06:50,070
Never had white cheddar?

6301
06:06:50,530 --> 06:06:52,210
If you get to have the chance, it's so yummy.

6302
06:06:52,670 --> 06:06:53,890
Leo, thanks for the 10 gifted.

6303
06:07:04,120 --> 06:07:05,700
Why did he want to leave again?

6304
06:07:05,700 --> 06:07:05,780
Again?

6305
06:07:08,600 --> 06:07:09,960
Everything is so easy.

6306
06:07:18,260 --> 06:07:22,160
I love how he was seemingly so invested in this game.

6307
06:07:22,400 --> 06:07:26,260
And then as soon as she's actually here, he's like...

6308
06:07:26,260 --> 06:07:26,760
Whoa, I don't know.

6309
06:07:26,840 --> 06:07:27,380
I'm scared.

6310
06:07:29,520 --> 06:07:31,160
He's like, I don't like this anymore.

6311
06:07:32,140 --> 06:07:33,420
I want to go home.

6312
06:07:34,420 --> 06:07:36,840
But he was seemingly obsessed with this game.

6313
06:07:39,600 --> 06:07:41,460
The MC isn't very smart.

6314
06:07:41,640 --> 06:07:42,920
He kind of really sucks.

6315
06:07:44,140 --> 06:07:44,520
Hello!

6316
06:07:47,520 --> 06:07:48,240
Yeah.

6317
06:07:50,680 --> 06:07:52,520
He's not dedicated enough.

6318
06:07:52,640 --> 06:07:54,780
This is literally everybody's dream.

6319
06:08:12,160 --> 06:08:12,880
Camera?

6320
06:08:13,160 --> 06:08:14,720
Oh, free camera on this outfit.

6321
06:08:14,800 --> 06:08:15,580
I haven't yet.

6322
06:08:16,540 --> 06:08:17,320
You're so right.

6323
06:08:18,900 --> 06:08:21,700
Oh god, he is such a jumpscare.

6324
06:08:24,220 --> 06:08:25,660
Oh my

6325
06:08:36,920 --> 06:08:37,840
gosh!

6326
06:08:38,640 --> 06:08:40,300
So cute!

6327
06:09:00,910 --> 06:09:02,690
Wait, hold on real quick.

6328
06:09:08,560 --> 06:09:09,780
Yeah, the devs know.

6329
06:09:19,820 --> 06:09:20,700
Sorry, one second.

6330
06:09:20,800 --> 06:09:21,480
I'm checking something.

6331
06:09:25,940 --> 06:09:26,800
Okay, I'm good.

6332
06:09:32,600 --> 06:09:34,400
Yeah, I forgot about the loading menu.

6333
06:09:35,420 --> 06:09:36,560
Or the loading screen.

6334
06:09:55,660 --> 06:09:57,780
She's just talking to me and sipping her juice.

6335
06:09:59,700 --> 06:10:01,420
Sorry for eating by the way.

6336
06:10:01,880 --> 06:10:03,560
I just was getting really, really hungry.

6337
06:10:14,130 --> 06:10:15,610
Let's play console!

6338
06:10:16,170 --> 06:10:16,630
Console.

6339
06:10:17,070 --> 06:10:17,390
Okay.

6340
06:10:17,730 --> 06:10:19,050
Play a console game.

6341
06:10:19,710 --> 06:10:21,110
That's the last thing baby.

6342
06:10:21,110 --> 06:10:23,110
That's the last thing.

6343
06:10:28,040 --> 06:10:29,360
What is the...oh wait.

6344
06:10:32,240 --> 06:10:32,580
Okay.

6345
06:10:34,780 --> 06:10:39,000
I will try and redeem myself with the penguin.

6346
06:10:40,900 --> 06:10:41,800
Penguin for outfit.

6347
06:10:41,980 --> 06:10:42,120
Okay.

6348
06:10:46,220 --> 06:10:48,160
I'm not good at this one though.

6349
06:10:50,640 --> 06:10:51,780
Win twice?

6350
06:10:51,880 --> 06:10:52,820
Oh I have to win twice?

6351
06:10:53,060 --> 06:10:53,600
Oh no.

6352
06:10:54,300 --> 06:10:55,080
Oh gosh.

6353
06:10:55,600 --> 06:10:56,400
Oh boy.

6354
06:10:56,520 --> 06:10:57,020
Oh golly.

6355
06:10:57,300 --> 06:10:58,940
Oh golly, golly, golly.

6356
06:11:00,260 --> 06:11:01,820
Off to a strong start.

6357
06:11:03,520 --> 06:11:04,560
Okay, nice.

6358
06:11:13,540 --> 06:11:15,440
Is the tie okay?

6359
06:11:15,440 --> 06:11:15,580
Is the tie okay?

6360
06:11:24,070 --> 06:11:24,710
Gosh,

6361
06:11:33,810 --> 06:11:35,030
I don't like this game at all.

6362
06:11:43,560 --> 06:11:45,120
It's going easy on me I think.

6363
06:11:49,830 --> 06:11:50,850
Oh damn!

6364
06:11:51,390 --> 06:11:51,770
Wow!

6365
06:11:58,520 --> 06:11:58,920
Wow!

6366
06:12:02,040 --> 06:12:04,100
Okay, so I did that.

6367
06:12:04,800 --> 06:12:06,040
Now I have to do it again?

6368
06:12:19,490 --> 06:12:20,710
It won't let me.

6369
06:12:24,490 --> 06:12:26,310
You have to win both rounds of the game.

6370
06:12:32,240 --> 06:12:32,880
What do you mean?

6371
06:12:32,960 --> 06:12:33,140
Oh.

6372
06:12:38,840 --> 06:12:40,240
Oh, one is enough for the ending?

6373
06:12:40,420 --> 06:12:40,680
It is?

6374
06:12:42,360 --> 06:12:43,260
I can't tell.

6375
06:12:43,340 --> 06:12:44,700
Everybody is telling me different answers.

6376
06:12:44,900 --> 06:12:45,460
I don't know.

6377
06:12:46,060 --> 06:12:49,200
I don't know what you guys...I don't know what you guys...I don't know.

6378
06:12:49,900 --> 06:12:51,480
Everybody is telling me different answers.

6379
06:12:51,680 --> 06:12:52,240
I guess we'll...

6380
06:12:53,020 --> 06:12:54,340
We'll see I guess.

6381
06:12:57,660 --> 06:12:59,560
Oh, one for ending, two for outfit.

6382
06:13:01,400 --> 06:13:02,740
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

6383
06:13:03,360 --> 06:13:03,960
I understand.

6384
06:13:08,110 --> 06:13:08,990
Her boots!

6385
06:13:16,850 --> 06:13:20,310
Dang, I can't believe that a tie doesn't count for the outfit.

6386
06:13:20,430 --> 06:13:21,430
That's so messed up.

6387
06:13:32,570 --> 06:13:37,090
Oh, it won't let me do photo mode so I can't see what her shoes look like, what her feet...

6388
06:13:38,870 --> 06:13:39,190
Wait.

6389
06:13:46,490 --> 06:13:47,610
That's a good card.

6390
06:13:51,770 --> 06:13:53,130
Hers was a six, right?

6391
06:13:53,270 --> 06:13:53,890
I'll do seven.

6392
06:14:02,170 --> 06:14:02,630
Defense.

6393
06:14:04,630 --> 06:14:05,090
Oh,

6394
06:14:08,350 --> 06:14:09,470
I have one, I have one.

6395
06:14:16,190 --> 06:14:16,910
Okay.

6396
06:14:17,550 --> 06:14:18,230
Highest health.

6397
06:14:19,690 --> 06:14:20,010
Wow.

6398
06:14:21,250 --> 06:14:23,670
You're making it real easy for me.

6399
06:14:24,690 --> 06:14:25,210
Mita.

6400
06:14:34,330 --> 06:14:35,050
Defense.

6401
06:14:35,590 --> 06:14:38,570
Oh gosh, I don't like when it does that sometimes.

6402
06:14:40,450 --> 06:14:43,030
Oh no, I don't have a ten defense.

6403
06:14:43,330 --> 06:14:44,210
I lose.

6404
06:14:50,670 --> 06:14:53,050
No, I thought I was gonna have a Minto sweep.

6405
06:14:55,470 --> 06:14:56,430
Okay, here we go.

6406
06:15:08,100 --> 06:15:10,700
Yeah, we have all the things to unlock the other ending.

6407
06:15:12,880 --> 06:15:16,100
I started watching you a little, like a week ago.

6408
06:15:17,020 --> 06:15:19,520
You're my first 0.2 membership in Super Chat.

6409
06:15:19,820 --> 06:15:21,200
Wow, thank you, Selken.

6410
06:15:22,280 --> 06:15:24,980
Even in just a week, I really appreciate it.

6411
06:15:25,040 --> 06:15:25,900
Thank you.

6412
06:15:26,620 --> 06:15:27,600
Thank you, thank you.

6413
06:15:30,360 --> 06:15:31,480
Oh wait, her feet.

6414
06:15:32,860 --> 06:15:33,800
She's wearing socks.

6415
06:15:36,580 --> 06:15:37,620
Here we go.

6416
06:15:37,620 --> 06:15:38,500
Open.

6417
06:15:40,520 --> 06:15:43,640
Real, dramatic, slow-like.

6418
06:15:43,860 --> 06:15:44,380
What the hell?

6419
06:15:44,560 --> 06:15:45,620
Why was it doing that?

6420
06:15:51,140 --> 06:15:53,320
Are you hiding something from me?

6421
06:15:55,600 --> 06:15:56,780
MC is so dense.

6422
06:15:57,720 --> 06:15:59,100
He's so dense.

6423
06:15:59,420 --> 06:16:00,560
Okay, here we go.

6424
06:16:00,560 --> 06:16:08,480
I like that too, but still.

6425
06:16:12,220 --> 06:16:15,140
I want to know what on earth that knocking was.

6426
06:16:26,380 --> 06:16:27,520
Okay, here we go.

6427
06:16:27,520 --> 06:16:31,260
We've done all the conditions.

6428
06:16:32,480 --> 06:16:34,860
We can stay.

6429
06:17:02,900 --> 06:17:04,360
We're little guys.

6430
06:17:06,040 --> 06:17:07,600
I'm so slow.

6431
06:17:07,920 --> 06:17:08,600
Oh my god.

6432
06:17:09,140 --> 06:17:10,160
Why do I have this?

6433
06:17:10,900 --> 06:17:13,340
Damn, my gamer posture is so severe.

6434
06:17:15,380 --> 06:17:16,340
Oh no.

6435
06:17:17,440 --> 06:17:19,260
We're these little guys.

6436
06:17:19,720 --> 06:17:20,780
Oh gosh.

6437
06:17:21,120 --> 06:17:23,540
If I try to leave, nothing happens.

6438
06:17:24,200 --> 06:17:25,760
I guess let's go sit on the couch with her.

6439
06:17:25,960 --> 06:17:26,900
Oh yeah, I see the circle.

6440
06:17:28,820 --> 06:17:31,260
Thanks for the super chat.

6441
06:17:36,980 --> 06:17:38,660
Gamer neck real.

6442
06:17:46,810 --> 06:17:48,030
Finally happy.

6443
06:17:48,170 --> 06:17:50,190
Oh, peaceful mode now available.

6444
06:17:52,370 --> 06:17:53,590
Peaceful mode?

6445
06:17:55,590 --> 06:17:57,530
I kind of love that idea.

6446
06:18:00,310 --> 06:18:01,410
She's so cute.

6447
06:18:03,030 --> 06:18:04,310
You fixed her.

6448
06:18:05,170 --> 06:18:05,170
Congratulations.

6449
06:18:06,290 --> 06:18:07,390
Peaceful mode.

6450
06:18:08,390 --> 06:18:15,410
Wow, I guess that would help to get other endings so that you don't have to...

6451
06:18:20,130 --> 06:18:20,690
die.

6452
06:18:20,950 --> 06:18:21,490
Check it?

6453
06:18:21,590 --> 06:18:21,970
Click it?

6454
06:18:24,790 --> 06:18:26,850
This mode is still in development.

6455
06:18:27,310 --> 06:18:30,610
It's so expansive that the developers haven't managed to finish it yet.

6456
06:18:30,610 --> 06:18:34,990
But don't worry, they promised it will be included in a major update coming soon.

6457
06:18:35,230 --> 06:18:38,310
And look at you, already ahead of the curve by unlocking access.

6458
06:18:38,770 --> 06:18:40,270
Now all that's left is to wait.

6459
06:18:40,770 --> 06:18:41,890
So what is peaceful mode?

6460
06:18:42,230 --> 06:18:45,270
It's your chance to reconnect with Fita in a completely different way.

6461
06:18:45,610 --> 06:18:47,710
She'll be overjoyed to spend more time with you.

6462
06:18:48,010 --> 06:18:51,710
From morning to night, in a world brimming with fun and surprises.

6463
06:18:52,290 --> 06:19:01,570
Expect heartfelt one-on-one conversations, sharing cookies, playing games, and plenty of hilarious moments together.

6464
06:19:03,470 --> 06:19:05,470
Totally real mode, by the way.

6465
06:19:08,590 --> 06:19:10,130
Oh great, Mita.

6466
06:19:11,390 --> 06:19:14,030
Wow, there's actually so many that I haven't gotten.

6467
06:19:14,770 --> 06:19:15,510
That's okay though.

6468
06:19:16,010 --> 06:19:16,790
I beat the game.

6469
06:19:18,190 --> 06:19:19,410
And I'm very tired.

6470
06:19:20,390 --> 06:19:21,910
So I'm going to go to sleep.

6471
06:19:22,450 --> 06:19:25,730
My copy of Metal Gear Solid, the board game.

6472
06:19:25,810 --> 06:19:26,370
Integral version.

6473
06:19:27,350 --> 06:19:29,150
Integral edition in mail yesterday.

6474
06:19:31,290 --> 06:19:32,710
Standard is now at retail.

6475
06:19:32,930 --> 06:19:38,410
I haven't, mine hasn't, mine has been shipped but it's like long till it arrives.

6476
06:19:38,730 --> 06:19:39,950
Like it hasn't even moved.

6477
06:19:40,770 --> 06:19:45,750
I'm so, I was actually so upset today because I was on AmiAmi looking at figures and stuff.

6478
06:19:46,530 --> 06:19:48,430
And I was looking at my orders.

6479
06:19:48,430 --> 06:19:54,310
And I realized an order had shipped of a Yuru Camp figure that I got, Nadeshiko.

6480
06:19:54,710 --> 06:19:56,430
And I was like...

6481
06:19:57,990 --> 06:19:59,870
When did this, when did I ship this?

6482
06:20:01,650 --> 06:20:03,150
And it was back in November.

6483
06:20:03,990 --> 06:20:05,290
And I never got it.

6484
06:20:05,810 --> 06:20:07,610
And I'm so...

6485
06:20:07,610 --> 06:20:12,690
I only, I think I've just been so busy I paid for it and I just never realized that it never arrived.

6486
06:20:12,690 --> 06:20:15,810
Because it shipped shortly after I...

6487
06:20:18,210 --> 06:20:21,170
Or shortly before I left for Japan in December.

6488
06:20:21,370 --> 06:20:23,170
So I was just like...

6489
06:20:24,030 --> 06:20:26,930
And now I think it's too late for me to contact them.

6490
06:20:27,930 --> 06:20:29,490
So I think I got lost.

6491
06:20:30,090 --> 06:20:31,870
I was so, I was so angry.

6492
06:20:32,650 --> 06:20:35,430
I was so angry, upset earlier about it.

6493
06:20:35,490 --> 06:20:35,870
I was like...

6494
06:20:35,870 --> 06:20:36,070
No!

6495
06:20:40,130 --> 06:20:42,670
And then I never even realized.

6496
06:20:43,390 --> 06:20:45,190
Congrats on finishing, I'm so happy I was here.

6497
06:20:45,290 --> 06:20:46,110
Thank you!

6498
06:20:46,490 --> 06:20:47,770
Funny, thanks for the one month.

6499
06:20:49,350 --> 06:20:51,010
Yeah, I'll try to contact them.

6500
06:20:52,010 --> 06:20:55,710
And I'm hoping, I saw that people were getting their Metal Gear...

6501
06:20:55,710 --> 06:21:00,910
Metal Gear, I was thinking about it earlier because I was like people are getting, I see people getting their Metal Gear board games.

6502
06:21:01,290 --> 06:21:04,550
And mine hasn't, the tracking hasn't updated at all.

6503
06:21:04,550 --> 06:21:05,950
So I'm scared.

6504
06:21:06,930 --> 06:21:09,410
I'm scared that it will be...

6505
06:21:10,890 --> 06:21:12,210
That it will be the same.

6506
06:21:12,610 --> 06:21:13,570
I don't know.

6507
06:21:15,610 --> 06:21:19,170
But yeah, that happened to me today so it's fresh in my brain.

6508
06:21:19,430 --> 06:21:20,550
I'm like...

6509
06:21:21,890 --> 06:21:22,330
No.

6510
06:21:23,090 --> 06:21:24,790
Anyway, this was a lot of fun.

6511
06:21:24,890 --> 06:21:25,850
I did like the game.

6512
06:21:26,750 --> 06:21:28,530
I thought some of the...

6513
06:21:29,610 --> 06:21:31,570
I thought it was...

6514
06:21:31,570 --> 06:21:35,650
I thought the creepy moments were very creepy, they could be very creepy.

6515
06:21:37,330 --> 06:21:37,890
And...

6516
06:21:39,550 --> 06:21:44,710
I like that a lot of the puzzles and things like that didn't overstay their welcome.

6517
06:21:45,890 --> 06:21:49,450
So overall it didn't feel like, oh this part is so frustrating.

6518
06:21:49,990 --> 06:21:52,570
Like even the parts when I was having to avoid the...

6519
06:21:53,790 --> 06:21:54,350
The...

6520
06:21:54,350 --> 06:21:57,570
The weeping angel Mitas, they were very...

6521
06:21:57,570 --> 06:21:58,170
Very...

6522
06:21:59,870 --> 06:22:01,070
They were...

6523
06:22:01,070 --> 06:22:03,570
They were still...

6524
06:22:04,990 --> 06:22:06,490
Which Mito is your favorite?

6525
06:22:08,690 --> 06:22:11,730
I still like the robot Mita.

6526
06:22:12,050 --> 06:22:14,570
Well I guess they're technically all robots but...

6527
06:22:15,550 --> 06:22:16,710
It can't be a second.

6528
06:22:17,850 --> 06:22:19,350
They're like tied for first.

6529
06:22:20,830 --> 06:22:22,610
Can't wait for a Mito mod on this game.

6530
06:22:22,930 --> 06:22:23,210
Stop.

6531
06:22:23,210 --> 06:22:23,250
Stop.

6532
06:22:28,700 --> 06:22:31,260
Holding out O for MGS board game hand cam.

6533
06:22:32,180 --> 06:22:33,480
Tech goddess Mita.

6534
06:22:33,640 --> 06:22:35,180
Yeah, is that what her name is actually?

6535
06:22:39,980 --> 06:22:40,500
Minta.

6536
06:22:41,000 --> 06:22:41,960
Thanks for the fun stream.

6537
06:22:42,080 --> 06:22:42,980
Thank you guys!

6538
06:22:43,660 --> 06:22:45,040
Yeah, this was fun.

6539
06:22:45,640 --> 06:22:47,340
I'm very tired now.

6540
06:22:47,800 --> 06:22:49,920
I thought it would be...

6541
06:22:49,920 --> 06:22:54,980
I didn't... I thought I was only going to be going for like four hours, not six.

6542
06:22:54,980 --> 06:22:58,340
Because I heard a lot of people being like, you can beat it in four hours.

6543
06:22:58,860 --> 06:23:01,000
And you know me, I take my time with everything.

6544
06:23:01,840 --> 06:23:02,280
So...

6545
06:23:03,720 --> 06:23:04,160
Yeah.

6546
06:23:06,500 --> 06:23:06,940
But...

6547
06:23:06,940 --> 06:23:08,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6548
06:23:08,400 --> 06:23:09,940
I think I'm going to call it here.

6549
06:23:11,000 --> 06:23:13,060
I have so many messages that I have to...

6550
06:23:26,900 --> 06:23:29,580
I have so many messages from people.

6551
06:23:30,000 --> 06:23:31,300
Okay, alright, sorry.

6552
06:23:31,300 --> 06:23:33,560
Alright, more time with Mita was always appreciated.

6553
06:23:33,680 --> 06:23:35,280
I did have a lot of fun though, so...

6554
06:23:35,280 --> 06:23:39,360
I'm glad that I held off on watching people play it.

6555
06:23:39,420 --> 06:23:45,020
Now I can go watch a bunch of other Vtubers play it and see what their reactions were as well.

6556
06:23:46,620 --> 06:23:47,260
Otsurrito everybody!

6557
06:23:48,020 --> 06:23:49,080
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

6558
06:23:49,140 --> 06:23:51,360
And I will see you guys later!

6559
06:23:52,320 --> 06:23:53,540
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye!

6560
06:23:53,720 --> 06:23:54,620
Good night!

6561
06:23:54,720 --> 06:23:55,480
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
