1
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:14,080
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba da da da.

2
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,820
Welcome back, Master and Mistress!

3
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,400
Hello everybody!

4
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,320
Welcome to Tokyo Jungle!

5
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,280
Every time I say this name, I think of... do you guys know Atarashii Gakko?

6
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,660
I say that as if they're not one of the most popular J-pop artists out there right now.

7
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,820
But I knew them before they were popular.

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,260
But they have a song called Tokyo Calling.

9
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,960
Yeah!

10
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,500
And so every time I think of Tokyo Jungle, I go, Tokyo Jungle!

11
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,860
Tokyo Jungle!

12
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,280
Tokyo Jungle!

13
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,780
Hipster Mint.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,300
Yeah.

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,140
I have pictures of me going to an event of theirs.

16
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,400
Well, it was a collaboration in...

17
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,020
It was...

18
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,380
It was...

19
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,980
It was...

20
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,100
I'm checking my Instagram.

21
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,340
It was in 2016.

22
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,020
I saw some people calling this Audio Jungle too.

23
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,640
That was so funny.

24
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,440
Audio Jungle.

25
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,760
Audio Jungle.

26
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,940
But yeah.

27
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,240
Tokyo Jungle, a game that I know a little about.

28
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,540
I played a tiny bit a long time ago.

29
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,240
But excited to play it.

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,920
Because this game is only on here.

31
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,740
There's no way...

32
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,520
I think you can also play it on the Vita.

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,380
But...

34
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,060
Who's playing on the Vita?

35
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,660
Yeah, it's like...

36
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,460
So...

37
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,660
It's only here.

38
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,620
So you're seeing it here.

39
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,200
Everybody in 2024.

40
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,800
I feel like this game would be such a great thing to get.

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,360
Like a...

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,660
Like a remaster or something at least.

43
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,160
You know?

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,960
Vita...

45
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,720
Omega LOL.

46
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,880
Blast from the past.

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,480
I know.

48
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,660
This game is still on my PS3.

49
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,140
And if you were curious.

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
Which you probably weren't.

51
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,360
But I'm gonna tell you anyway.

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,360
Yes.

53
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,820
Metal Gear Solid 4 is the disc that's in my PS3 right now.

54
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,000
Um...

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Yep.

56
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,900
I could switch at any time.

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,260
Where it belongs.

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
It'll never leave.

59
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,860
Yeah, it just kind of sits in there.

60
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,120
Being a good...

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,260
Being a good game.

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,960
Who would have guessed?

63
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,560
I know.

64
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,540
I'm shocked.

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,540
You should be.

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,060
Also Kyle.

67
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,380
Thank you for the five gifted.

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,380
Thank you so much.

69
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,760
I do want to preface though.

70
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,480
Today will probably be a shorter stream.

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,420
Because I...

72
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,960
Have a late night meeting.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,300
So...

74
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,880
Um...

75
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,100
I have to be awake.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,780
And...

77
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,820
I'm not dying for that.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,900
Can we switch now?

79
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,300
Switch?

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
Nintendo Switch?

81
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,960
No.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
This is the PS3.

83
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,100
Um...

84
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,160
Shorter stream.

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,220
Because I'm not playing Metal Gear.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,020
But it's funny.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,680
Because I...

88
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,180
Have...

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,160
Um...

90
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,880
I think next week I have a couple longer streams planned.

91
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,360
Um...

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,520
My...

93
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,340
I don't know.

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,260
My schedule next week is still mostly undecided.

95
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,260
Um...

96
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,240
But I...

97
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,460
Have...

98
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,400
Uh...

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,940
Uh...

100
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,220
Some stuff that might have popped up.

101
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,780
I don't know.

102
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,800
I don't know what's going on.

103
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,140
But go up.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,400
Thanks for the five gifted.

105
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,960
Thank you.

106
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,120
Outer Wilds is there.

107
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,700
Exactly.

108
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,380
So that...

109
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,000
That in of itself will be a longer stream.

110
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,460
I think Doom...

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,860
Is on Sunday.

112
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,020
That'll be a longer stream.

113
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,720
Um...

114
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,980
Metal Gear.

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,300
You know.

116
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,900
Yeah.

117
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,340
So...

118
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,780
Hmm.

119
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,960
Yep.

120
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,260
Yep.

121
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,800
Yep.

122
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,740
Does PSN still exist in PS3?

123
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,920
I've heard that both PSP series and PS3 is in PSN.

124
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,780
No longer there except for PS4 and PS5.

125
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,380
No, it is.

126
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,160
PSN is still there.

127
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Because I literally...

128
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,360
I don't know.

129
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,680
I just bought a Metal Gear icon right before this.

130
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,860
And...

131
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,740
Yeah.

132
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,290
So...

133
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,930
It's still there.

134
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,370
A Metal Gear icon.

135
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,450
Is what I said.

136
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,450
Probably didn't hear me.

137
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,930
I bought a...

138
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,590
I bought an icon for my account.

139
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,770
It was 50 cents.

140
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,030
It was 50 cents.

141
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,990
And then...

142
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,450
They had like a whole icon pack of MGS3, MGS2, and Peace Walker.

143
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,670
Yeah.

144
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,950
Money well spent.

145
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:35,970
Yeah.

146
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,030
So...

147
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,850
This is cute.

148
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,690
I'm happy.

149
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,670
Thank you.

150
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,790
Okay.

151
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,570
Let's...

152
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:45,950
Let's...

153
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,130
Press any button.

154
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,530
Oh, wait.

155
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,330
I think I talked for so long.

156
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:49,590
My...

157
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:49,770
Okay.

158
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,410
So...

159
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:52,970
Oh, I see.

160
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,050
Oh, I can't do story mode.

161
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,870
I was going to say, should I do survival or story mode, but I can't even do story mode.

162
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,410
Ryakari!

163
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,090
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

164
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,090
Thank you so much.

165
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,950
Oh, also, maybe I shouldn't start yet because I'm waiting for my food to finish.

166
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,330
I have a...

167
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,370
I have a...

168
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,090
Actually, how much time is left?

169
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,930
Oh, I didn't set a timer.

170
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,490
Uh-oh.

171
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:17,850
Wait.

172
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,130
When did I put it in?

173
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,710
Uh...

174
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,670
It's probably fine.

175
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,070
Weird.

176
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,110
Usually, story is first.

177
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,410
Right?

178
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,710
Like, usually...

179
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:38,230
I wonder if you have to unlock stuff to then get the story.

180
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,970
Also, rare costumes and animal characters.

181
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,310
DLC.

182
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,410
There is one DLC that I know.

183
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:50,550
lol.

184
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,250
Shikanoko Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glow Glowthe Glutin.

185
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,430
Ryakari!

186
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,810
Thank you for another 10 gifted!

187
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,550
Thank you!

188
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,550
Thank you!

189
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,330
lol.

190
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,250
Story is, like, unlockables for specific animals.

191
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,570
Ah!

192
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,490
I see, I see.

193
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,730
What should we be?

194
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,290
We couldn't...

195
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,670
No, I think there are two at the very beginning.

196
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,790
I think there is a...

197
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,150
The dog and the deer.

198
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,910
Maybe we should be the shika-noko-noko-noko-koshi-tan-tan.

199
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,410
Daaarn!

200
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,110
Thanks for the thank you, dude!

201
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,950
Your streams make my days better.

202
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,330
Thank you!

203
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,070
Missile... well, we can always do both as well.

204
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,730
So, no worries.

205
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,510
Be the dog-dog.

206
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,370
Missile-minto.

207
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,410
So, we'll just chit-chat for a bit until...

208
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,450
until I remember if my food is done.

209
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,170
I'm gonna go check on it real quick.

210
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,750
Hold on, I'm getting worried.

211
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,470
Hold on, I'll be right...

212
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,090
I'll be right back.

213
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,250
Sorry.

214
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,190
Sorry that took so long.

215
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,190
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

216
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,130
I got a candy that I got in Japan.

217
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,250
Before.

218
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,070
Do you guys...

219
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,210
Do you guys wanna...

220
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,650
Okay, I haven't had this before.

221
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,290
It's a shio cider.

222
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,410
A salt... salt cider.

223
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,470
And I'm gonna try it.

224
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,350
Okay.

225
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,110
I'm nervous.

226
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,370
What if it's like...

227
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,450
What if it like pops in my mouth?

228
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,210
Okay.

229
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,350
The outside is...

230
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,850
is a powder.

231
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,350
Okay.

232
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,970
We can chat while we wait.

233
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,990
Immediately leaves.

234
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:31,830
Sorry.

235
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,910
It was like...

236
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,350
Okay.

237
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,910
I think it like needed like two minutes.

238
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,990
But I wasn't gonna come back and like sit for two minutes and then leave again.

239
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,430
I thought that would be silly.

240
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,350
So...

241
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,370
But it was like almost done.

242
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,010
I thought.

243
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,790
I think it's done.

244
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,730
I think...

245
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,250
Maybe I took it out a little bit early.

246
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,730
But that's okay.

247
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,790
Okay, here I go.

248
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,790
Thanks for the HAGS postcard I received in the mail today.

249
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,330
Thank you, Rob!

250
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,930
Oh my gosh, though.

251
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,710
I saw that so many...

252
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,650
I think at the post office, all the postcards were like destroyed.

253
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,030
I'm so sad by it, though.

254
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,410
Like it has this ugly looking like tire mark on top of it.

255
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,330
Like they got run over.

256
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,270
I think we were talking about that maybe...

257
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,350
If anybody wants a reprint, we can send those out.

258
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,510
But I would have to get them...

259
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,590
I would have to...

260
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,310
Maybe like we wouldn't have them signed.

261
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,370
But...

262
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,490
The mark goes right over your head on mine.

263
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,590
Yeah, that's how...

264
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,930
That's how...

265
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,050
Just a tire mark on your face.

266
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,570
Of course, it would be on my face.

267
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,650
I did all the work.

268
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,810
And it's on my face.

269
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,270
I so thought it's garbage and put it in the trash.

270
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,750
Divorce.

271
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,330
Divorce.

272
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:53,910
Divorce.

273
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,530
Divorce.

274
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,670
Divorce.

275
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,030
But yeah...

276
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,290
We're gonna do envelopes and stuff for the future too.

277
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,350
So that this doesn't happen.

278
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,030
We're really sorry.

279
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,850
It's a learning experience for us as well.

280
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,110
Okay, I'm gonna try this candy.

281
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,940
It's like really sour.

282
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,580
But...

283
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,320
It's fizzy.

284
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, it's fizzy.

285
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,180
It's already in my tongue.

286
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,360
Can you hear it?

287
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,040
Oh my god.

288
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,540
I can...

289
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,400
I can hear it in my ears but...

290
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,900
I think it's too difficult to hear on the mic.

291
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,560
When did you get to the inside?

292
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,240
Oh, I sneak a new copy in the next envelope.

293
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:15,800
Oh, true!

294
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:25,480
But like I said, it probably wouldn't be signed because it took us days to sign the other ones.

295
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,680
I don't know what's on the inside, though.

296
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,680
It's just a hard candy on the inside.

297
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,600
Did you sign them all off, Kai?

298
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,260
Yeah, we did!

299
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,820
So next time we meet up, we're probably gonna have to sign the next batch.

300
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,920
But I have to order all of them, so...

301
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,720
Mm-hmm.

302
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Okay.

303
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:05,860
Wow.

304
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,160
It's really hard.

305
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,560
Wow.

306
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,220
Did you get your MGS Collector's Edition?

307
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,640
No!

308
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,680
They keep selling out!

309
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,080
You have to sign up for text...

310
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,220
or for, like, notifications for Wario 64.

311
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,860
But they text, or they send so many tweets.

312
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,400
Did you get Carpal Tunnel from signing all those cards?

313
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,320
No, actually, surprisingly, it didn't hurt so much.

314
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh my gosh, thank you for the pink play!

315
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,680
Thank you!

316
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,560
I was a PSP during the old days.

317
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,040
You were a PSP!

318
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,220
How did you become sentient?

319
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,700
But never have PS3, because the games I wanted to play...

320
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,840
was Infamous 2.

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,540
Probably another PS3 game.

322
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,220
You know, it's Asura's Wrath, an Infamous series, also God of War.

323
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,960
But I played Patapon 2 and Monster Hunter Unite.

324
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,780
Nice!

325
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,260
Okay,

326
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,350
I eat my real food now.

327
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,910
Maybe I should have eaten my real food before having candy.

328
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,650
I don't like the inside.

329
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,670
I kind of like the fizz.

330
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,990
Because it made me feel things.

331
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,130
It made me feel a little funny.

332
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,010
It makes my tummy feel tickly.

333
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,830
I don't know if I like the crunchy part, though.

334
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,510
I'm 100% gonna frame it.

335
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,730
I got lucky in the ink smear.

336
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,830
It's only from Mata's eyebrows and above.

337
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,570
It's a very lovely card.

338
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,450
I did notice one thing, though.

339
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,150
This is 100% my fault.

340
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,370
I'm gonna put out an apology about it.

341
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,770
But I 100% forgot to include the artist's name.

342
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,170
And I didn't even realize until I was like...

343
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,950
I was taking a shower in Japan.

344
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,330
And I was in the shower and I was like...

345
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,270
Oh no!

346
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,390
And Matara was like, what's wrong?

347
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,890
And I was like, I forgot to put the illustrator's name on the postcard!

348
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,330
I was so upset with myself.

349
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,450
I was so mad.

350
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,950
So...

351
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,910
I'm gonna let the artist know.

352
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,050
And I'm also gonna put out an apology.

353
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,110
Because I feel really, really, really bad.

354
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,210
Oh, I feel so bad.

355
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,530
But...

356
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,170
If people ask for...

357
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,690
If we do reruns of them...

358
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,490
I can put the artist's name on the second one.

359
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:33,930
So...

360
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,070
Maybe we will just include them in the envelope.

361
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,110
Maybe that will be better.

362
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,310
Hmm...

363
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,630
Yeah, maybe.

364
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,930
But I was in such a rush to make them at all.

365
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:55,830
Because...

366
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,170
I had to make sure that they got done in time for Ofukai.

367
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,310
Okay.

368
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,010
Apology video.

369
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,110
I feel so bad though.

370
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,910
So...

371
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,250
Would it cost a lot more using envelopes?

372
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,710
I'm not sure.

373
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,830
But...

374
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,270
It's okay.

375
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,080
But...

376
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,680
You know...

377
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,880
Again, it's a learning...

378
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,540
It's a learning...

379
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,120
And also...

380
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,600
I had...

381
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,540
Not to put...

382
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,720
Throw Matara under the bus.

383
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,820
But...

384
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,660
She did also double check them.

385
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,300
I said...

386
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,500
This is what the postcards look like.

387
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,080
What do you think?

388
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,680
And she said...

389
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,400
All good!

390
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,100
She didn't say anything either.

391
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,980
So...

392
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,280
Oh no!

393
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, let's blame her!

394
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,200
Blame Matara-Khan!

395
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,220
Blame Matara-Khan!

396
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,430
Yeah!

397
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,410
Fire!

398
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:57,890
Fire!

399
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,790
Witchcraft!

400
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,650
I mean...

401
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,430
Um...

402
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,090
Burn her at the stake!

403
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,190
That's what I meant to say.

404
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,990
I think the most annoying thing though...

405
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,310
Will be having to seal all the envelopes.

406
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,790
Because...

407
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,210
Like...

408
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,170
We'll have to stuff them.

409
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,510
And seal them.

410
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,630
Hmm...

411
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,550
That's the most annoying part.

412
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,090
Just checked and I got my postcard too!

413
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:26,510
Yippee!

414
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,550
I think the residue is from whatever machinery marks the postage is.

415
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,730
Okay.

416
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,430
I think so too.

417
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,270
Because...

418
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,690
All...

419
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,690
All the pictures that I've seen are very similar.

420
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,370
Like...

421
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,030
They all look like a tire scuff mark.

422
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,930
So an envelope should make things okay.

423
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,610
Luckily, most of the art is intact on mine.

424
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,150
Yay!

425
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,990
Actually...

426
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,350
At one of my jobs...

427
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,290
I was like...

428
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,310
At my data...

429
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,130
Data...

430
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,530
Um...

431
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,230
Entry...

432
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,270
Job that I had...

433
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,810
A long time ago...

434
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,230
I also stuffed envelopes.

435
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,250
Hmm...

436
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,110
When there was no...

437
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,590
When there was no...

438
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,870
Uh...

439
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,270
Data entry to enter...

440
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,790
I was stuffing envelopes.

441
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:02,970
So...

442
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,450
Truly...

443
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,990
I'm just...

444
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,230
Uh...

445
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,130
Returning back to my old...

446
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,270
Office worker life!

447
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,810
For real!

448
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,590
Or...

449
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,470
After life...

450
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,030
I guess.

451
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,750
Hmm...

452
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,390
Hmm...

453
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,390
Does it count as a life?

454
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,270
Hmm...

455
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,050
Even if I'm dead.

456
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,650
Hmm...

457
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,270
But I'm in my afterlife.

458
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,190
Hmm...

459
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,670
But it's an office worker life.

460
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,190
The office worker's not dead.

461
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,470
I don't know.

462
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,530
Ghost things are weird.

463
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,230
My un-life.

464
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,120
Sorry for eating.

465
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,440
I saw Sadoway do a spicy MGS3 cosplay on Twitter today.

466
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,660
My first thought was...

467
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,500
Would Mint like this cosplay?

468
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm in this post.

469
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,780
But since it's of Eva, I guess not.

470
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,120
What do you mean I love Eva?

471
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,040
I love Eva.

472
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,920
I don't...

473
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,160
I...

474
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,700
The only person I dislike is Huey.

475
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,080
The only person I dislike is Huey.

476
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,180
Even...

477
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,980
Even...

478
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,540
Even...

479
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,600
Even Naomi.

480
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,400
I like to make fun of her.

481
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,460
Mmm...

482
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,690
Huey deserved worse.

483
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,150
Yeah!

484
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,190
I'm so excited to play Metal Gear.

485
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:37,870
I feel like people might have expectations, and then the expectations will really heighten my anxiety.

486
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,070
And then,

487
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,870
people will be like, oh no, she's so bad.

488
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,970
And I'll be like, wait...

489
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,290
I mean, I've only played it a couple times, truly.

490
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,510
Like, I'm not an expert, but...

491
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,050
Expectations meant damn bad for snakes.

492
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,070
Expectations chaos.

493
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,670
I'm even more nervous about MGS2.

494
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,130
Oh gosh.

495
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,750
European extreme, no kill, no alarm run.

496
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,050
Are you excited for MGS3?

497
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,610
I'm not there yet, mentally.

498
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,130
I think I'm just... I'm so excited for Delta, I'm like, Delta!

499
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,970
I just want to see Minto have fun.

500
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:51,830
Yay!

501
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,590
Thank you.

502
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,980
You can get the brain rot hyperfixation without being good?

503
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,740
Yeah.

504
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,240
I mean, mostly, there's like a YouTube channel that plays 24 hour Metal Gear streams.

505
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:22,800
And like, maybe like, even when I don't have the sound on for it, it's on for like, a good majority of my day.

506
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,960
So I'm just always have it on in the background somewhere.

507
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,280
Or someplace.

508
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,420
I'm just... Is that your alt account?

509
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:33,800
Stop.

510
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,220
George.

511
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,900
Is that his name?

512
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,620
Honestly, I don't remember.

513
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,800
But... I just almost always have it on, so...

514
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,960
So, that's where, like, I'm always, like, if I'm like, thinking of Metal Gear, like, you know, rather than like, playing the games...

515
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,280
Um...

516
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:06,800
To satiate my brain rot, I'm on Mercari looking for stuff, and also, um, on that livestream.

517
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,020
Hmm...

518
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,160
Can you truly say you play Metal Gear Solid if you never got big boss rank?

519
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,660
I never got big boss rank.

520
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,780
Metal Gear Curious George.

521
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,180
Not Curious George.

522
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,720
I did that one time.

523
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,940
I dressed up as Curious George.

524
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,720
Did you guys know that?

525
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,440
I dressed up as Curious George.

526
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,840
And... So basically...

527
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,660
My friend... I had a friend who was really into, um...

528
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,720
Into, like, acting and stuff.

529
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,940
Like, he...

530
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,020
Uh... This was when I was in, like, elementary school.

531
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,960
And he, um...

532
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,120
He... He played... I remember he played...

533
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,380
One of the kids in Peter Pan.

534
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,740
But he was, like, really... Because of that, um...

535
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,120
He was one of the kids in a... In a college production...

536
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,080
Of Peter Pan.

537
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
And... So he knew this college well.

538
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,920
And their acting department.

539
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,860
No, not the Lost Boys.

540
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,580
It was one of the...

541
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,940
It was one of, like, the...

542
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,900
The children that goes to Neverland.

543
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,800
But, anyway...

544
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,120
They invited him.

545
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,980
That college invited him to dress up for...

546
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,300
I think it was either, like, an anniversary of Curious George or the birthday of Curious George.

547
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,760
Something.

548
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,660
And they were like, do you wanna dress up and do you wanna be the man in the yellow hat?

549
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,380
And I'm like... Thinking back now, I'm like, why?

550
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,800
Okay, hold on.

551
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,860
But, anyways... He asked me if I wanted to be Curious George.

552
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,960
But now I'm thinking, why did he ask me that?

553
00:28:59,380 --> 00:28:59,900
Wait...

554
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,620
Why did he ask if I would be Curious George?

555
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,220
Why wasn't he Curious George?

556
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,320
Why did he think that of all of our friends...

557
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,620
I would be the best fit for Curious George?

558
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Wait a second!

559
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,360
Wait a second!

560
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,480
Fuck it!

561
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,960
It's so funny, too.

562
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,880
I don't talk to him anymore, but my mom still talks to his mom.

563
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,580
And she even mentioned him the other day.

564
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,360
She was like, I'm gonna go meet...

565
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,360
Do you remember that old friend you had in elementary school?

566
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,820
I'm gonna go meet his mom!

567
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,660
I'm gonna have her ask!

568
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,240
I'm gonna ask him!

569
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Well, I'm not going.

570
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,520
But, I'm gonna have her ask him.

571
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,520
Why did you ask Mint to be Curious George?

572
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,140
But anyway...

573
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,700
I remember that day so well because...

574
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,020
Because I was like a menace.

575
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,000
I was throwing books.

576
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,160
I was climbing on tables.

577
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,300
I was harassing everybody in the library.

578
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,820
I was just like, I'm Curious George!

579
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't know what Curious George is like at all.

580
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,800
I don't know.

581
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,300
But...

582
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,200
But I remember at one point I was climbing on the table.

583
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,560
And I either hit my funny bone or I hit something in my knee.

584
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
And my vision literally went black.

585
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,540
I like was seeing stars.

586
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,480
I was like, oh my god, this is it for Curious George.

587
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,640
Curious George's birthday and death days is the same day.

588
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,260
And I remember... I remember just like keeling over as Curious George being like...

589
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,440
I remember the day so well because I was in so much pain from that moment.

590
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,780
Oh god.

591
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,900
It's the trauma.

592
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,840
But I have to just remember.

593
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,800
I also... I got to take off a day of school for that... for that moment.

594
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,460
For my pain.

595
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,460
But it was worth it because I got to stand on tables.

596
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,140
Curious George ends up in the hospital a lot.

597
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,500
Oh no!

598
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,560
What if they thought it was real?

599
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,840
Like not a bit.

600
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,900
Or I mean, what if they thought it was a bit?

601
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,360
I mean...

602
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,000
What's a TBI?

603
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm scared.

604
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,080
Maybe I shouldn't have read that out loud.

605
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,180
You really just have...

606
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,800
Oh wait.

607
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,620
You really have just always been like this.

608
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,080
What are you talking about?

609
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,060
Oh, a traumatic brain injury.

610
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,540
What?

611
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,100
I hit my leg.

612
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:50,780
It...

613
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,460
It transferred.

614
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,780
It was a full body concussion.

615
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,520
Yeah,

616
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,800
it's so much fun being Curious George.

617
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,320
Would do it again.

618
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
It made me think...

619
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,380
Like if I could be a character actor for like a theme park or something.

620
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,720
That'd probably be so fun.

621
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,680
To like...

622
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,040
I wanna be Donald Duck.

623
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,000
That was the day Min decided to become a Vtuber.

624
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,800
Honestly...

625
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Until...

626
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,560
Until...

627
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,440
I saw...

628
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,520
The...

629
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,400
The auditions...

630
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,300
Like even when I saw Vtubers, I never thought about becoming a Vtuber.

631
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,480
But it wasn't until the auditions that I was like...

632
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,000
Like the Hololive...

633
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,520
Myth auditions that I was like...

634
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,500
I do kinda wanna become...

635
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,620
Maybe I can become a Vtuber.

636
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:54,940
So...

637
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,460
Yippee!

638
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,960
Love this game.

639
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,500
Yippee!

640
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,720
I'll be playing it.

641
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,100
Don't worry.

642
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,400
Sorry.

643
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm eating dinner like really quickly.

644
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,040
Oh my god.

645
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,860
For like a half hour.

646
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,960
I'm so sorry you guys.

647
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,040
Crunch, crunch, munch.

648
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,880
Sorry.

649
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,660
Sorry.

650
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,160
Sorry.

651
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,100
One more bite.

652
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,600
One more bite.

653
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,930
Pre-game Zatsu.

654
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,010
Yeah.

655
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,770
Pretty much.

656
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,800
Okay.

657
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,760
Oh!

658
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,400
I just realized you guys can't hear the notifications.

659
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,080
I'm so sorry.

660
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,620
I keep forgetting.

661
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,680
But congrats on your signature debut at Off Guy.

662
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,540
Thanks!

663
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,380
I managed to get a signed card from the Boston Challenge.

664
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,220
And it's so cute.

665
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,160
And I like comparing the slight variations with friends.

666
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,620
Stop!

667
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,780
Don't do that!

668
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,420
Don't compare them!

669
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,240
I forgot there was a big wave.

670
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,060
Blue soup was...

671
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,640
So...

672
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,560
Tea, but...

673
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,080
Thank you.

674
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,620
Yeah.

675
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,040
My signature changed over the weekend because I was like...

676
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,900
I had an idea for it and then it changed a little bit because of the postcards.

677
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,340
Even probably each postcard, it'll change a little bit.

678
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,520
I wonder who got the hee-hee card.

679
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,840
No, it was a...

680
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,160
It was a hee-hee sticker from the panel.

681
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,540
They probably threw it away.

682
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,840
They probably threw it away.

683
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh...

684
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,500
It's evolving.

685
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,860
What did it end up as?

686
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,040
It's pretty much the same.

687
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,660
There's just a little slight variation.

688
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:58,940
Mint.

689
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Why was I the monkey?

690
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,940
Also mint.

691
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,600
So I was climbing on a table.

692
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,200
Don't think that, mint.

693
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,820
We weren't supposed to pass out the stickers actually.

694
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,280
Apparently a lot of...

695
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,560
Hey chat.

696
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,640
You notice how some of the signatures have different facial expressions?

697
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,040
Cute.

698
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,860
What was I saying?

699
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,340
Oh yeah.

700
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,020
At conventions, a lot of conventions don't allow stickers.

701
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,900
Even like...

702
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,760
Some conventions don't allow...

703
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,840
Artists to sell stickers in like the artist alley even.

704
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,220
But...

705
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
There's like a...

706
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,040
They're afraid that people will like stick them on like walls.

707
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,320
And stuff like that.

708
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,340
So...

709
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,260
When I gave it to the staff.

710
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
To Ofkai staff.

711
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,340
I was like...

712
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,320
Here I have some stickers.

713
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
For people that come to the panel.

714
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,460
And they were like...

715
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:00,820
Uh...

716
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,040
Um...

717
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,580
Well...

718
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,260
Uh...

719
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,340
I think they still passed them out though.

720
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,060
Did anybody who went to Ofkai and went to our panel...

721
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,960
Did you get a...

722
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,140
Did you get a sticker?

723
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,600
Please say yes.

724
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,300
Because I spent extra money on it.

725
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,820
I did?

726
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,000
I got both of them?

727
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,280
Yay!

728
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,140
Yeah, there was...

729
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,660
Mint ones and Matara ones.

730
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,000
Do they keep from selling stickers at artist alley or something?

731
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,680
Or just free stickers or a no-go?

732
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,360
I think it's...

733
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,640
You're not allowed to sell them either.

734
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,780
I think.

735
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,400
I just woke up.

736
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,760
Thanks for waiting specifically for me.

737
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,640
Before starting with.

738
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,620
You are so welcome.

739
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,480
Ok, now we can start everybody.

740
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,740
Sorry for the delay.

741
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,600
When I went to get a package at the post office the other day.

742
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,140
I pulled the Mata sticker from my wallet.

743
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,880
And sent my driver's license.

744
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,220
Oh my god.

745
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,100
Wait, why didn't you pull the mint sticker?

746
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,860
Why didn't you pull the mint sticker instead?

747
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,420
What?

748
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,100
Would you rather be Matar than Mint?

749
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,360
I didn't get it!

750
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,560
What do you mean I didn't get it?

751
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,160
RNG.

752
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,600
Oh, maybe they were random.

753
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,960
They were just kind of giving whoever.

754
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,620
The postcard is so cute!

755
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,700
Looking forward to the next one.

756
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,820
Thanks for bringing more eyes on the Tokyo Jungle.

757
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,640
I loved it and hope it will get re-released because I love the silly accessory in your art deck.

758
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,020
Oh, hold on.

759
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,920
Can I check?

760
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,180
And my art tag.

761
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,360
I'm checking.

762
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,480
I'm going to Twitter.

763
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,360
Silly accessory...

764
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,080
Oh my god.

765
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,660
The first thing I see is a Hawaiian t-shirt.

766
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
You guys, some things are not showing up in my...

767
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,000
When did you... When did you send it?

768
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,380
The accessory.

769
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,440
Oh wait.

770
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,780
I went to the wrong tag.

771
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,200
My bad.

772
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,940
Some things are not showing up in my... Oh my god.

773
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,180
Wait!

774
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:16,820
Stop!

775
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,300
This is so stupid!

776
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,380
Um...

777
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,120
Uh, sometimes I notice that things don't show up in my art tag.

778
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,940
Or like, I'll see things show up.

779
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,060
Like, as like a... You know how sometimes you get like, oh this is a related tweet.

780
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,700
But, um, it doesn't show up in my art tag.

781
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,740
Okay, I'm going to put it on later because...

782
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:46,900
Ah!

783
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,040
Oh gosh, that's why.

784
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,560
Oh god.

785
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,820
I'm going to mess up something with all my...

786
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm working on a vertical monitor here, so...

787
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,440
Because my current... My other monitor is the game, so...

788
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,290
Ghost powers...

789
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,030
Oh god.

790
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:06,650
Sorry.

791
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,970
I messed up the, you know...

792
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:10,830
The...

793
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,190
Um...

794
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,990
You know, the way that you are able to view me.

795
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,710
Otherwise...

796
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:16,790
You know, the way that you are able to view me.

797
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,790
Otherwise...

798
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,590
Otherwise, I would be...

799
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,950
I would be transparent, you know?

800
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:20,930
Okay!

801
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,080
Someone poorly explained this game to me.

802
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,000
You animal...

803
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,560
Survive...

804
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,720
Make baby.

805
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,340
Survive!

806
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,660
Run from crocodile.

807
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,100
Survive.

808
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,320
Survival!

809
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,740
Here we go, baby!

810
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,000
Hopefully it's...

811
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,500
Loud enough.

812
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,160
Humankind has vanished.

813
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,240
I'm kind of worried because I get really sad when animals get hurt.

814
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,240
A decade later, Tokyo's familiar landscape has become a home to beasts.

815
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,440
A jungle.

816
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Pets have turned feral.

817
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,580
Wild animals have escaped from the zoo.

818
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,540
Oh my god, wait.

819
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,380
Is that a Matsuya?

820
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,840
For real?

821
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,160
Race horses have been freed from servitude.

822
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,540
Oh, my musubi!

823
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,420
You're free!

824
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,580
Let's take a look at this brave new natural order.

825
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,920
Uma-pyon!

826
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,660
Uma-pyon!

827
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,240
Oh my god, that's me!

828
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,860
Tutorial missile!

829
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,540
Turn up the audio just a little bit.

830
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,000
Stealth?

831
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,420
Oh no.

832
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,240
Why is that step one?

833
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,940
If you hope to survive, do not allow stronger animals to see you.

834
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,500
Okay.

835
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,220
But he could smell me, right?

836
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,940
Oh, I'm just a little dog!

837
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,240
Tall grass offers vital cover.

838
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,020
The grass blocks other animals' lines of sight.

839
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,980
Oh, he's so cute!

840
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Oh, oh!

841
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,320
Ah!

842
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,080
The tooth...

843
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,380
Do you think if ghosts count as human cotton?

844
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,640
No!

845
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,840
Leaving the grass will expose you!

846
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,840
I'm exposed!

847
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,180
Don't look!

848
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,600
The game would be too hard if they could also smell you, maybe.

849
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,570
Reach your destination using the grass to stay hidden.

850
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,430
Okay, the car.

851
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,950
This is just a tutorial, guys.

852
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,350
We're fine.

853
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,940
Can he see...

854
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,640
Can he see me, like...

855
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,520
This dog's blind!

856
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,060
Oh no!

857
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,000
The wolf's got sight of you!

858
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,500
Fail!

859
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,620
Okay.

860
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,240
He turned around so fast.

861
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,780
Okay.

862
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,120
Go, go, go.

863
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,440
Nice.

864
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,160
Oh, okay.

865
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,580
Good, good, good.

866
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,620
Oh, he woke up!

867
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,160
He woke up!

868
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,220
Fall back asleep, buddy.

869
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,720
Okay.

870
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,700
We're gonna wait for them to turn around.

871
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,280
Turn around.

872
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:33,900
Nice.

873
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,100
Okay.

874
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,660
They won't see me now, right?

875
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,260
If I run?

876
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,360
Run!

877
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,640
Jump!

878
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,480
Jump!

879
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,860
Oh!

880
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,700
Nope!

881
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,020
Pitiful Pomeranian.

882
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,860
I'm a cat!

883
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,100
Hunter!

884
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,160
Hunting!

885
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,340
Predators live by catching and eating other animals.

886
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,700
The hunger gauge shows your current hunger level.

887
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,860
Unless you eat, the hunger gauge will reach zero and you will begin to lose life!

888
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,020
If an animal's life reaches zero, it will die!

889
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,760
No!

890
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,980
Oh my god!

891
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,580
I know, this is just nature.

892
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,060
Look there!

893
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,020
A rabbit!

894
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,300
Approach it without being seen, then go in for the kill!

895
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,220
Oh my god!

896
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,600
I know, this is just nature!

897
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,380
Close on the rabbit without letting it see you.

898
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,260
Oh!

899
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,800
Once in striking distance, an icon will appear to indicate timing.

900
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,500
Press R1 the moment the bite icon turns red to large.

901
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,670
Strip your prey's bones and eat your fill!

902
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,430
Rules of nature!

903
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,750
Eat!

904
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,860
Eat!

905
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,060
Eat!

906
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,460
Eat!

907
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,320
Oh my god!

908
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,580
I'm a dog!

909
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,480
Combat!

910
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,800
In the law of the jungle, animals must compete for food.

911
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:19,720
Odd!

912
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,400
Is that a hyena?

913
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,320
The scent of a fresh kill has drawn hyenas!

914
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,320
You can't deliver a killing bite while the enemy is watching you.

915
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,300
First you must create an opening.

916
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,080
Use the square button to claw and expose the hyena to attack.

917
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
End it with a bite?

918
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,000
Can I eat the hyena?

919
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,980
Dog go bongo, don't look!

920
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,090
Enemies will attempt to catch you in their own jaws.

921
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,490
If successful, the attack is fatal.

922
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,690
But if you evade it, they are exposed to counter attack.

923
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:13,750
When the bite icon appears over the beagle, evade, then counter!

924
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,410
How do I do that?

925
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,410
Oh, evade!

926
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:16,930
Ah!

927
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:17,990
Counter!

928
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,150
You eluded the hyena's jaws!

929
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,330
The hyena is left wide open.

930
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,650
Don't let this champ slip by!

931
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,790
Bite the hyena back!

932
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,460
CQC!

933
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,840
Even victors are rarely unscathed.

934
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,500
If the enemy has a pack, the danger rises.

935
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,580
Well, we'll have our own pack.

936
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,880
The hyena pack is just beyond.

937
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,500
Use claw and fang to claim their territory for your own!

938
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,520
Oh my god.

939
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,840
Defeat all the hyenas.

940
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,860
Ah!

941
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,700
Ah!

942
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,720
Oh, shoot.

943
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,100
Two hyenas remain!

944
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:01,880
Ah!

945
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,640
Oh!

946
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,180
Oh!

947
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:03,780
Evade!

948
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,240
Ah!

949
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,120
Yeah!

950
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,820
He's sniffing out.

951
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,660
He's sniffing me out.

952
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,360
He's sniffing me out.

953
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,200
I'm taking your territory, buddy!

954
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,160
Oh!

955
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,640
Ah!

956
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:14,980
Oh!

957
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,140
Claw!

958
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,720
Claw!

959
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,020
Claw!

960
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,360
Claw!

961
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,020
Claw!

962
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,100
Claw!

963
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:19,140
Claw!

964
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,480
Claw!

965
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,720
Oh!

966
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,120
Oh!

967
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,720
Oh my god!

968
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,140
Oh my god!

969
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,520
Oh my god!

970
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:23,960
Don't kill me!

971
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,500
Claw!

972
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:25,940
Claw!

973
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,240
Claw!

974
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,940
I can claw you!

975
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,700
There we go.

976
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,760
Whoo!

977
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,080
Excellent.

978
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,300
My caution.

979
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,880
There's even a caution level?

980
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,980
Oh my god.

981
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,400
No way.

982
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,440
CQC!

983
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,220
CQC!

984
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:40,940
CQC!

985
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:41,160
CQC!

986
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,260
CQC!

987
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:42,400
CQC!

988
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:42,540
CQC!

989
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,000
CQC!

990
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,840
CQC!

991
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:47,760
CQC!

992
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,240
You don't have to hide but are poor fighters as a result.

993
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,020
What the...

994
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,920
There's just mushrooms.

995
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,540
Plants grow in a wide variety of places.

996
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,140
The plant icon on your radar shows their position.

997
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:04,780
Okay.

998
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,220
I see it.

999
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,460
There's even a radar.

1000
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,780
Is this just Metal Gear?

1001
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,360
Eat three types of plants without being seen by predators.

1002
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:12,580
Okay.

1003
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,210
I'm hidden.

1004
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,010
I'm hidden.

1005
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,430
I'm hidden.

1006
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,830
I'm hidden.

1007
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,590
I'm hidden.

1008
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,130
I'm hidden.

1009
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,050
Metal Gear but with animals.

1010
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,590
Eat!

1011
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,970
Eat two more types of plants.

1012
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:36,290
Okay.

1013
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,910
I think there's only this guy over here so...

1014
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,130
Eat!

1015
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,590
I hope he doesn't see me though.

1016
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,090
Don't see me.

1017
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:45,410
Okay.

1018
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:45,610
Good.

1019
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:47,770
Don't see me.

1020
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:50,930
Don't see me.

1021
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,030
Don't see me.

1022
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,090
I'm gonna turn...

1023
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,210
Oh!

1024
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:56,410
I just realized I'm kind of big so after the tutorial I'll make myself a little bit smaller.

1025
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,610
So that you guys can see better.

1026
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,870
Eat!

1027
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,830
I ate everything.

1028
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:06,730
One more...

1029
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:07,650
What do you mean one more to go?

1030
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,250
I ate it over there!

1031
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,130
I ate it!

1032
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,030
Make yourself bigger.

1033
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:16,050
Run!

1034
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,860
Oh, I didn't finish eating it.

1035
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,550
Oh!

1036
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,490
Eating grass.

1037
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,060
Oh my god!

1038
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
The hyena has seen you.

1039
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,900
A sheikah deer stands no chance against a hyena.

1040
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,060
Oh my god.

1041
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,500
Run!

1042
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,680
There.

1043
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,540
A stand of tall grass.

1044
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,220
Run for cover in the grass before the hyena catches you.

1045
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,700
Go!

1046
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,760
Danger 100!

1047
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,240
Oh!

1048
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,260
Oh!

1049
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,380
Oh my god.

1050
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,500
If you can enter a stand of tall grass before predators get too close, you can lose them.

1051
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,840
This dumb dog.

1052
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,340
This guy is so stupid.

1053
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,300
After losing sight of a prey, a predator will try to track them by scent.

1054
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,000
If you are sufficiently far and hidden from view, your scent will fade.

1055
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,580
The chance you'll be found decreases.

1056
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,040
When the danger gauge drops to zero, the enemy will give up and move on.

1057
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,760
Just a grass.

1058
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:26,820
Just a...

1059
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,260
It seems you've escaped with your life this time.

1060
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,380
Oh my god.

1061
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,560
This game is insane.

1062
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
This deer is...

1063
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,180
Oh, his little tail.

1064
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:34,880
So cute.

1065
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,080
This deer barely stood in the grass.

1066
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,280
What a dumb dog.

1067
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,680
Oh.

1068
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,480
Breeding.

1069
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,900
I'm a big dog.

1070
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,580
At age 15, an animal's life approaches its end.

1071
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,080
They must mate and reproduce or die out.

1072
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,800
Oh my god.

1073
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,340
I can't die without...

1074
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,120
without...

1075
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,260
without...

1076
00:49:59,280 --> 00:49:59,600
breeding.

1077
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,460
Before finding a female and mating, you must secure your own territory.

1078
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,260
Four marking points exist throughout the Shibuya Station area.

1079
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,280
Oh, we're in Shibuya?

1080
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,460
Oh, I recognize it now!

1081
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,000
Up there, where...

1082
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,360
where the gauge is?

1083
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,300
Isn't that where the...

1084
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,020
Isn't that where...

1085
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,560
the Starbucks is?

1086
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,580
I think.

1087
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,660
Use your radar to locate them.

1088
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,180
Females?

1089
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,160
I have a radar for females?

1090
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,740
You can also see their precise locations by pressing start to view your map.

1091
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,940
Mark each of these four points to claim Shibuya Station for your own.

1092
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,480
Oh my god.

1093
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,400
Female radar.

1094
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,000
Hello?

1095
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:45,720
Oh!

1096
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,120
Marking.

1097
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,240
Oh.

1098
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,400
I'm peeing?

1099
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,760
Hold on.

1100
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,480
One second.

1101
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,940
I am going to make myself smaller.

1102
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:54,600
Okay.

1103
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,720
Like here.

1104
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:08,950
Hey.

1105
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,950
What are you doing in my area?

1106
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,230
Clean kill.

1107
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,810
I'm not even hungry.

1108
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,290
I just did that because I'm a psychopath.

1109
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,270
I'm marking territories.

1110
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,270
Where is another territory?

1111
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,710
Oh, that's a bunny.

1112
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,610
It's okay bunny, I'll let you live another day.

1113
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:32,770
Is there anybody here?

1114
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,790
I see them on the map.

1115
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,110
Okay, it doesn't matter.

1116
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,810
I can't tell what's a bad animal and what's a good animal, you know?

1117
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:46,770
Oh, I have a stamina meter!

1118
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:47,910
Oh my god, I just realized.

1119
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:52,270
I just realized I have a stamina meter.

1120
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:55,710
Probably shouldn't just hop around then.

1121
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,510
Over here.

1122
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,270
See ya, hyena!

1123
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,290
And yeah, I am gonna eat you.

1124
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:12,870
Delicious.

1125
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,690
Oh, I'm gonna eat you till I'm full.

1126
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,190
Down to the boat!

1127
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,910
Oh my god!

1128
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,730
This game is real easy when you're a dog.

1129
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,450
Okay, last one over here.

1130
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,530
Go, dog, go!

1131
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,270
Mark your territory!

1132
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,710
Reclaim the females!

1133
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,490
Oh!

1134
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,350
Oh shoot.

1135
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,470
It's okay, I got him.

1136
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,290
Rodeo!

1137
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,530
Herbivore is like hard mode, right?

1138
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,560
The Shibuya Station lair is now yours to use!

1139
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,660
Nice!

1140
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,460
Yeah, where's the...

1141
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,680
Oh, now we can breed!

1142
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,880
She's in love with me!

1143
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,300
Females have a arrived following the pheromone trail.

1144
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,800
The females have arrived!

1145
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,590
Come here.

1146
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,650
Use the radar to locate a female and make her your partner.

1147
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,590
Oh boy, I am.

1148
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,650
The females have arrived!

1149
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,690
Get out of here, bunny.

1150
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,970
You don't wanna see what's gonna happen here.

1151
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,450
Oh, the bunny wants to watch.

1152
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:34,950
Never mind.

1153
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,750
There are three grades of mate.

1154
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:40,550
Prime, average, and desperate.

1155
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,240
You guys, I'm desperately mating here, please.

1156
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,500
Give me a chance.

1157
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,320
I can't.

1158
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,040
Oh god.

1159
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,740
But the best females will only respond to males of a certain caliber.

1160
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,300
Woo!

1161
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,340
Perform hunts to raise your standing as a male.

1162
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:18,800
Wait.

1163
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,100
This golden retriever hasn't reached a sufficient rank to interest her.

1164
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Hunt down prey and feed to refine your skills as a male.

1165
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,180
Well, lady, I have something cool to show you.

1166
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,660
Come on, please.

1167
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,660
I'm desperate.

1168
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,140
I'm desperate.

1169
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,820
You need to rank up to mate with that female.

1170
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,450
Oh my god.

1171
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,010
Oh.

1172
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,550
Oh my god.

1173
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,510
Is that a sleeping cat?

1174
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,090
Stop.

1175
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,450
No, I'm gonna get Doki Bird over here.

1176
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,190
Oh, shoot.

1177
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:01,850
She's fast.

1178
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:02,410
Okay.

1179
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,570
What the hell?

1180
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,870
Oh my god.

1181
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:06,270
I'm stupid.

1182
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:07,290
Hey, hold on.

1183
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:07,730
That's mine.

1184
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:08,310
It's mine.

1185
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:10,990
You.

1186
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:12,490
Oh my god.

1187
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,330
The cat's trying to get me.

1188
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,530
One.

1189
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:19,430
Oops.

1190
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:20,270
They noticed me.

1191
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,990
I'm so desperate.

1192
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,450
Oh, I gotta eat it.

1193
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,110
I gotta eat it.

1194
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:29,370
That's right.

1195
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:31,570
Yummy.

1196
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:33,710
Excellent.

1197
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,790
I'm gonna eat it to the veteran.

1198
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:39,650
What does that mean?

1199
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,230
Survival of the fittest.

1200
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,150
This is just a game.

1201
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,290
It's just a game.

1202
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:48,370
Goodbye, Doki Bird.

1203
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,190
I'm eating your body.

1204
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,530
What else can we get?

1205
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,190
Look at her just standing there.

1206
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,170
Black buck.

1207
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,630
She saw that, right?

1208
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,350
She saw that?

1209
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,210
Look, I'm just eating.

1210
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:14,410
For the thrill of it.

1211
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,010
I'm not even eating because I'm hungry.

1212
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,450
Hey, am I good now?

1213
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,170
I need to rank up still?

1214
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,330
How much do I need to kill here?

1215
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,750
These guys are fast.

1216
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,390
Is that a chinchilla?

1217
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:28,890
Stop.

1218
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:31,310
Oh no, it's a bunny.

1219
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,590
Oh my god.

1220
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,770
There's more bunny.

1221
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,410
Oh my god, the sheep are hard.

1222
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,390
Is that a monkey?

1223
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,550
I can eat the monkey?

1224
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,010
No way.

1225
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:56,910
Oh my god.

1226
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,930
Is he gonna go...

1227
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:59,650
Is he gonna attack me?

1228
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,010
I can't jump high enough.

1229
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,690
Maybe from here to here.

1230
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:07,390
Dang.

1231
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:08,190
Hold on.

1232
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,030
I think I can make that.

1233
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,890
Why can't I kill the birds?

1234
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,550
Okay, never mind.

1235
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:16,510
I give up.

1236
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:17,950
What else is there?

1237
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,890
Come back!

1238
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,290
How far can you go?

1239
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,010
Oh.

1240
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:26,830
Hide here?

1241
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,440
Hold on.

1242
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,220
The deer are coming.

1243
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:32,880
The deer are coming.

1244
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,580
Maybe from the front of the truck.

1245
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,660
Oh, maybe, maybe.

1246
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,550
They're like, oh my god!

1247
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,450
We just witnessed a murder!

1248
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,830
I

1249
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,840
think I'm good.

1250
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,580
Seems you've reached a sufficient rank.

1251
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,900
Try approaching the female again.

1252
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,820
Hold on.

1253
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,820
I'm not done eating.

1254
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,560
What the?

1255
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,080
I wanna get the monkey.

1256
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,500
You live today, monkey.

1257
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,840
Why am I so bad at this?

1258
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,600
Why am I so bad at this?

1259
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,050
Hey, did you see that?

1260
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:32,790
Did you see that?

1261
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,330
Did you see that?

1262
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,230
Let's make babies now.

1263
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,470
In front of these bones.

1264
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,190
You met your partner.

1265
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,750
The prime female is interested.

1266
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,570
Head for your lair together.

1267
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,790
Come on, girlie.

1268
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,070
Wait, follow me.

1269
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,210
I'll kill anything that stands in our way.

1270
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,950
Ah!

1271
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:55,890
Ah!

1272
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:57,250
Oh my god!

1273
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:58,190
That sheep is attacking!

1274
00:58:58,930 --> 00:58:59,890
It's retaliating.

1275
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:02,950
Is he still coming after us?

1276
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,130
Oh, I think he is.

1277
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:04,490
Uh oh.

1278
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,190
Wait.

1279
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,190
Where's our lair?

1280
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:10,270
It's upstairs.

1281
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,030
Oh my god!

1282
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,350
Hey, don't hit my lady like that.

1283
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,470
The sheep wants to join in.

1284
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,030
You and me, baby.

1285
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:29,670
I ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on our Discovery Channel.

1286
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,690
This is it.

1287
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,510
Join your partner at your lair to mate.

1288
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,370
This is so messed up.

1289
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:41,550
After mating, you'll have pups, and generations will change.

1290
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,810
Children inherit a portion of the skill their parents cultivated.

1291
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,950
Mate with your partner in the lair, then change generations.

1292
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,650
Come on!

1293
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:54,790
Let's mate!

1294
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,050
I'm about to die because I'm an old dog.

1295
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,110
Please.

1296
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:01,650
Oh god.

1297
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,270
Birthday golden

1298
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,720
retriever 2!

1299
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:18,230
Happy birthday golden retriever 2!

1300
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,520
Oh my gosh.

1301
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,320
There's an elephant.

1302
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,380
And a zebra.

1303
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,740
Hunting.

1304
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:29,480
Feeding.

1305
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,320
Fleeing.

1306
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:30,740
Mating.

1307
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,360
These are the axe...

1308
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,060
Fighting to survive is never easy, but only the victors live to see where the future leads.

1309
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,600
It's the dawn of another day in the Tokyo jungle.

1310
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,940
Are those... what kind of birds are those?

1311
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,680
Those dinosaurs?

1312
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,600
Okay, so about the R18 text...

1313
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:53,760
Head

1314
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,420
to the lair.

1315
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,440
Hard to even know her.

1316
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,080
Oh, I got a trophy.

1317
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:01,920
Jungle baby.

1318
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,640
I'm a jungle baby.

1319
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,040
Oh, now we have story mode!

1320
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,100
Oh, okay, okay.

1321
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:21,040
What do you guys... I think maybe for the purpose of the stream, since it's not gonna be super duper long, maybe just survival would be best.

1322
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,200
This is a real PS3?

1323
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,140
Of course it is!

1324
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:34,730
Survival unlock story.

1325
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,210
I think story is in chapters.

1326
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,190
Oh wait.

1327
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,350
Story is really long.

1328
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:40,870
Um...

1329
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,970
Story is in short little snippets.

1330
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:43,690
Okay, okay.

1331
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,650
So it's in short snippets, but it's pretty long.

1332
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:46,950
Maybe.

1333
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,030
Mate first, story second.

1334
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:52,230
Very, very short chapters early on.

1335
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,350
Well, maybe we can try it then.

1336
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,230
I'm kind of curious.

1337
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,310
What kind of story mode could we have?

1338
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:58,830
Mankind has vanished.

1339
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,050
Leaving Tokyo overrun with animals fighting to survive.

1340
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,810
Oh my gosh, it's Hachiko!

1341
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,730
So it's the tutorial again?

1342
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,250
Humankind.

1343
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,310
Mankind has vanished.

1344
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,360
Isn't this what we just saw?

1345
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,660
This is what we just did.

1346
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,140
Missile.

1347
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,420
A decade later, Tokyo is familiar.

1348
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:21,780
Yeah.

1349
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:23,940
Wait.

1350
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh, so we have to do survival to unlock the story.

1351
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,720
I thought...

1352
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,020
Okay, I understand.

1353
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,400
That was my mistake.

1354
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,520
Hold on, let me get... I'll get us... I'll get us out of here.

1355
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,440
Yes.

1356
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,440
I just wanted to see missile again.

1357
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,640
Okay, well then...

1358
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,240
It's time for survival mode, baby.

1359
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,720
New game.

1360
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,480
Multiplayer!

1361
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,060
Anybody want to play Tokyo Jungle with me?

1362
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,480
Pomeranian.

1363
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:15,980
Sheikah Deer.

1364
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,860
Complete the Sheikah Deer challenge.

1365
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,920
We got a little piggy!

1366
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:23,700
Porcupine.

1367
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,900
Ostrich!

1368
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:25,880
Hippo challenge.

1369
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,760
Now these are the DLC ones.

1370
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,240
So you could be...

1371
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,720
A red panda?

1372
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,060
What is that?

1373
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,080
Multiplayer mating.

1374
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,160
Okay, never mind.

1375
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,880
I do not want to play multiplayer with you.

1376
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,140
The crocodile!

1377
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,720
Maybe I should have bought those.

1378
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:50,960
Instead of...

1379
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,380
Maybe I should have bought those instead of him.

1380
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,870
Look at his pants.

1381
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,750
They're all dirty.

1382
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,430
I like how there's the...

1383
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,490
Alt color Pomeranian too.

1384
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:12,910
And the dinosaurs!

1385
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,910
Look, he can be a panda.

1386
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,010
I don't think...

1387
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:19,110
Pandas would live.

1388
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,510
I'm gonna be honest.

1389
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:22,450
Should we try it?

1390
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,930
Wait, does that mean we can find a lady?

1391
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,520
You think?

1392
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,040
If we like...

1393
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,120
Yeah, why is he...

1394
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:35,660
An herbivore?

1395
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,500
Wouldn't he be in...

1396
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,880
Maybe he was... you guys... I don't know.

1397
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:41,700
Maybe he was vegetarian.

1398
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,660
I'm kind of curious.

1399
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,140
I mean, I got him, so...

1400
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,720
Oh my god.

1401
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,260
That dog should be my pet.

1402
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,260
I'm gonna claim...

1403
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,620
I'm gonna claim this territory as my own.

1404
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,460
Cocoa!

1405
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:20,600
Oh,

1406
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:26,800
he's gonna go!

1407
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,620
Look at him, he's running over to his friend!

1408
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,000
Oh my god, I got a trophy.

1409
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:32,340
Don't!

1410
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:32,820
No, no, no, no!

1411
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,040
No, no, no, no.

1412
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,780
We're fine.

1413
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,280
We're chill.

1414
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,340
We're cool.

1415
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,280
We're cool.

1416
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,440
This is Legend of Zelda!

1417
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:47,370
Oh my god!

1418
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:50,730
Yes!

1419
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:51,130
Yes!

1420
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:53,290
Oh my god.

1421
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:57,710
Danger 100%.

1422
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:00,290
We can't let that dog see us.

1423
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:00,850
Oh, we're hungry.

1424
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,670
Oh.

1425
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:05,650
And take 1200...

1426
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:06,590
What was that?

1427
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,210
Challenges are triggered by meeting certain conditions.

1428
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,750
Completing a challenge will earn you special rewards.

1429
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:13,390
Open the menu.

1430
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:14,890
Have a look at challenges there.

1431
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,350
We're a rookie.

1432
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:25,010
Rookie gangster versus mob boss.

1433
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,770
Rookie gangster versus mob boss.

1434
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,970
Okay, let's go eat some food.

1435
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,770
You don't think the dog will like us, right?

1436
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:31,390
Oh.

1437
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,910
Survival points are a way of ranking your survival skills.

1438
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:39,010
You'll earn points for hunting, ranking up, taking over territory, changing generations, completing challenges, and surviving.

1439
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,870
Push your score to the limit and complete...

1440
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,490
compete in the rankings.

1441
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:43,530
Oh, okay.

1442
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,010
Level 1 crook.

1443
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:47,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1444
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:47,990
That's it.

1445
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:51,050
There's lots of food over here.

1446
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:53,790
Eat!

1447
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:57,150
UMAI!

1448
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:01,270
UMAI!

1449
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:06,950
Who's in the grass?

1450
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,290
Gotta eat this chill.

1451
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:13,130
UMAI!

1452
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:15,390
UMAI!

1453
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:18,950
This is so funny.

1454
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,310
I'm gonna pee here.

1455
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,710
ORE NO MON DA!

1456
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,330
I love this guy.

1457
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:31,030
So this is what an office job is like.

1458
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:33,870
I've gotten 500!

1459
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,650
Nice.

1460
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,190
I'm killing it.

1461
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:38,810
I'm killing it.

1462
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:40,550
Two years!

1463
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,410
Two year old!

1464
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,170
What if I leave this area?

1465
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,990
I'm kind of scared though.

1466
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,330
He's thriving.

1467
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:54,150
Okay.

1468
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,830
There's something over here though.

1469
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,200
There's nothing...

1470
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,500
There's no grass to protect me.

1471
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,320
So we gotta make sure it's not a crazy ant.

1472
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,600
What is that?

1473
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,580
I can't...

1474
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,080
Is that a rabbit?

1475
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,120
Maybe?

1476
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,840
Oh my god, our hunger goes down so fast.

1477
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,790
Why can't we get stuff out of the vending machines?

1478
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:23,190
You know?

1479
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,570
Oh my god.

1480
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,110
Jungle 24!

1481
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:30,290
What the hell?

1482
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:31,610
There's a Fujisoba here!

1483
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,410
No way!

1484
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,770
They actually have Fujisoba!

1485
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,450
That's so funny that they're able to like actually get the...

1486
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:42,570
the actual store names and stuff for some of these places.

1487
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:43,830
Whoa!

1488
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,030
It's looking kind of grungy over here.

1489
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,190
Oh, it's a dog.

1490
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,650
He's protecting the area though.

1491
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,590
I think I can attack him.

1492
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,150
Oh shoot!

1493
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,830
Ah!

1494
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,570
Oh god.

1495
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:04,450
Sorry, dog.

1496
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:06,130
I gotta eat these apples.

1497
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:07,430
I'm a little salary man.

1498
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:08,970
Oh my!

1499
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:10,530
Sorry, dog.

1500
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:12,130
I can't even do anything with him.

1501
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:12,690
It's so sad.

1502
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,110
This is my territory.

1503
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,050
I'm the most feral thing here.

1504
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,090
Sorry, doggo.

1505
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:22,930
Just don't think of it, guys.

1506
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:23,810
Just don't think of it.

1507
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,330
This is the rabbit, right?

1508
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:28,490
There was something over here too.

1509
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,530
Like, I wish I could move the...

1510
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:33,750
Oh!

1511
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:35,950
I wish I could move the camera.

1512
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,250
To see like...

1513
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,030
Let's go hide in the grass.

1514
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:42,030
Then we can see what it is.

1515
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:43,430
Oh!

1516
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,770
I think it's a pack of dogs!

1517
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:47,510
You guys, there's no way we'll survive this.

1518
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:50,390
There's no way.

1519
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:51,150
We can't...

1520
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:51,790
Oh gosh.

1521
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,530
A ferocious beast sighted you!

1522
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,170
Oh!

1523
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,770
Was sighted in Yoyogi Park.

1524
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:57,410
Wait.

1525
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,910
What do you mean?

1526
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,050
Why is it so dark?

1527
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,730
You will survive.

1528
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:08,210
Let's stay the hell away from Yoyogi Park.

1529
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,300
Oh, it's night time.

1530
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,940
That makes sense.

1531
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,980
This is my area.

1532
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,600
This is my territory.

1533
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,180
You're hungry?

1534
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,060
Oh my gosh!

1535
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,640
Salaryman, you just ate some apples!

1536
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,620
Could you calm down?

1537
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,220
You just ate some apples.

1538
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,640
What am I hearing?

1539
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,480
What am I hearing?

1540
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:36,780
Life is decreasing!

1541
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,460
Oh god!

1542
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:37,840
Eat!

1543
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,160
Eat!

1544
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:38,340
Eat!

1545
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,480
Come here!

1546
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,080
Come here!

1547
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,000
Come here!

1548
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,900
I need a female, you guys.

1549
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,480
He ate some apples last year.

1550
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,440
Did you hear that, though?

1551
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:53,880
Did you hear that, though?

1552
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:58,650
Oh my god.

1553
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,870
I'm gonna get this dog.

1554
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,650
Oh no!

1555
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:04,090
Sorry, beagle.

1556
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,070
Sorry, little beagle.

1557
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:10,070
I'm hearing a lot of noises.

1558
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,550
Oh my god!

1559
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,050
This is terrifying!

1560
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:16,750
What?

1561
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,070
What the beagle do?

1562
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,270
He was gonna attack me.

1563
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,350
Probably.

1564
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,690
When he wakes up.

1565
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:30,610
I need more food.

1566
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,030
I need more food.

1567
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:32,790
Oh, drink water!

1568
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,770
No, we have dysentery now.

1569
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:38,270
Probably.

1570
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:41,870
Six years?

1571
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,710
We're killing it.

1572
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,690
What's that triangle on the map?

1573
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:50,910
That can't be healthy.

1574
01:11:51,710 --> 01:11:52,670
What is this?

1575
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,010
Oh, that's the birds we killed earlier.

1576
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:59,510
It's not funny, but you know.

1577
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,030
What is that?

1578
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:05,690
Oh, it's a chicken.

1579
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,130
This is my mating spot.

1580
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:09,490
This is where we will mate.

1581
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,330
What are the yellow...

1582
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:13,890
Wait a second.

1583
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,850
Are the triangles ones that are...

1584
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,490
that will attack us?

1585
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:20,070
And then the circles are kind animals?

1586
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,570
Maybe that's the case.

1587
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:30,410
Or something.

1588
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:31,250
I can't tell.

1589
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:31,430
Oh.

1590
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,210
Oh, it's elevation.

1591
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,750
Ah, okay, okay.

1592
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:39,390
Oh, I see it now.

1593
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:40,870
Oh my god.

1594
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,670
My life is decreasing due to hunger.

1595
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,070
I need food.

1596
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,050
Oh my gosh.

1597
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,210
We need plants.

1598
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,090
Like pronto.

1599
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,090
Oh my god, my life is decreasing really fast.

1600
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,210
Drink the water.

1601
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,310
Oh my.

1602
01:12:57,190 --> 01:12:57,850
Oh my.

1603
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:01,530
Eat.

1604
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:04,930
Why are there so few plants?

1605
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,450
Can you eat the chicken?

1606
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:06,770
No.

1607
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,390
Oh, we did it.

1608
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:09,490
We did the challenge, everybody.

1609
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:12,170
Let's go.

1610
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,810
It's just corpses everywhere.

1611
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,730
Hungrier than snake.

1612
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,070
That's what I'm saying.

1613
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:23,410
What's over here?

1614
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,180
Whatever they are, they're asleep.

1615
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,420
I'm just gonna take that then.

1616
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,620
Oh, they're a bunch of bunnies.

1617
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,300
What is this?

1618
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,260
Okay.

1619
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,380
Oh, present!

1620
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,700
Zool Keeper Record.

1621
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,940
Archives are records left behind by mankind.

1622
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:53,300
Perhaps collecting them will offer some insight into humanity's sudden disappearance.

1623
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,180
Perhaps collecting them will offer some insight into humanity's sudden disappearance.

1624
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,620
Open the menu and read more under archives.

1625
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,420
Open the menu and read more under archives.

1626
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:02,620
I have to open the menu every time.

1627
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,160
It's kind of annoying.

1628
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,960
What's over here?

1629
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:09,680
What's over here?

1630
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:09,980
Chickens.

1631
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,200
Get out of my way, chickens.

1632
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,560
Where is any food?

1633
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:18,140
We got the Shibuya Station nest.

1634
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:18,980
Nice.

1635
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,800
Where's my female?

1636
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:25,720
Where's my female?

1637
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,100
Oh, ladies.

1638
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,540
Eat the chicken?

1639
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,340
I can't.

1640
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,380
I'm an herbivore.

1641
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,640
I can only eat grass.

1642
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,440
This grass is not good enough, apparently.

1643
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:43,580
This grass sucks.

1644
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,040
You are hungry.

1645
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:45,600
I know.

1646
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,720
I know I'm hungry.

1647
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,320
Just drink some water.

1648
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:51,900
Drink some water.

1649
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,940
Oh, my.

1650
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,760
What about...

1651
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,680
There was one more flag over here, though.

1652
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,200
Wasn't there?

1653
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:00,740
Hurry up.

1654
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,240
Grow back.

1655
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,020
It's been nine years.

1656
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,140
The grass is still not grown back.

1657
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,140
The nest?

1658
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,820
Yeah, maybe our female is waiting there for us.

1659
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,540
If there's no other humans, what do we...

1660
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:17,200
What do we...

1661
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,360
What do we...

1662
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:18,980
What do we...

1663
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,580
Who do we...

1664
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,640
I have concerns, you guys.

1665
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,580
I have concerns.

1666
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,440
There's no grass here.

1667
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:30,940
Oh, shit.

1668
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:31,860
I think I might die.

1669
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,480
No, no, no.

1670
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,000
We must find more food.

1671
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,920
We must find more food.

1672
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,800
Oh, no, you guys.

1673
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:45,590
Oh, no, you guys.

1674
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:50,590
It doesn't show where any food is, which sucks.

1675
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:51,170
It doesn't show where any food is, which sucks.

1676
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:51,350
It doesn't show where any food is, which sucks.

1677
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:54,030
Okay, there was...

1678
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,590
There was that other area.

1679
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:57,090
If I could...

1680
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,110
I don't think I'm going to make it.

1681
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:01,970
Can I drink this?

1682
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:02,550
Oh, here.

1683
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:03,350
Nice, nice, nice.

1684
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,870
Oh, thank goodness, thank goodness.

1685
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,450
It's just a little bit.

1686
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,010
It's just a little bit to get us through.

1687
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:10,050
I've survived ten years!

1688
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,940
It was over here.

1689
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:16,960
There was another area.

1690
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:17,620
What the?

1691
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,080
Defeat ten animals.

1692
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,280
Oopsie.

1693
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,100
Yeah, we're in Dogenzaka.

1694
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,940
I think the dogs will...

1695
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,540
Oh, they're gone.

1696
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:33,520
Um...

1697
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:33,960
Mine.

1698
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,000
I need food, please.

1699
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:41,160
Oh, God.

1700
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,040
Okay, nice.

1701
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,740
Any food?

1702
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,700
Oh, no, you guys.

1703
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,160
Food, food, food.

1704
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,100
Thank God.

1705
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:54,180
Oh, my God, there's food.

1706
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:56,120
Umai.

1707
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,380
Umai, umai, umai.

1708
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,280
Good, good, good, good.

1709
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,160
Good, good, good.

1710
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,900
Okay, we ate all that we could.

1711
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,820
Which wasn't so much, but...

1712
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,500
Oh, God.

1713
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,600
Did the dog see me?

1714
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,400
I think the dog saw me.

1715
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,140
I think I'm gonna take this spot.

1716
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,860
Territory of Shibuya Woods is polluted.

1717
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:24,780
Wait.

1718
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,020
So is it dangerous to come here?

1719
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,900
He can't breathe.

1720
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,420
It's a cruel joke.

1721
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:34,920
What?

1722
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,400
No way!

1723
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:44,920
It's like karaoke.

1724
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,680
Oh, my God.

1725
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:47,820
He's distracted.

1726
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:49,420
Matsuya!

1727
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,260
Is there food?

1728
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:52,860
Present!

1729
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:55,520
Bottled water!

1730
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:00,000
Wait, are we gonna die at 15 years?

1731
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,360
Use.

1732
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,560
Nice, nice, nice.

1733
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,760
I'm gonna mark this spot.

1734
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:10,820
Yeah!

1735
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,100
We have another...

1736
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,380
Where's my...

1737
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:16,900
Leading lady?

1738
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:20,940
Good night, world.

1739
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,560
Oh, shoot.

1740
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,660
Maybe I should have slept until morning.

1741
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,960
Maybe I should...

1742
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,400
Uh...

1743
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,700
This is fine.

1744
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:32,660
Probably.

1745
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,260
Oh, God.

1746
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,100
There's a planet here.

1747
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,480
Where is it?

1748
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,620
Oh, gosh!

1749
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,640
It's really toxic here.

1750
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,040
Then I gotta eat.

1751
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:47,960
It's fine.

1752
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:48,660
We'll be fine.

1753
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,100
Grab the present.

1754
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,680
Pet medicine?

1755
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,080
What does this have to do with me?

1756
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,500
Oh, it's toxic.

1757
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,340
Oh, God!

1758
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,360
It's really toxic here!

1759
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,260
Oh, God!

1760
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,520
Oh, it's just sheep.

1761
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,480
Oh, God!

1762
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,300
It's so toxic!

1763
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,620
Oh, God!

1764
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:10,300
It's so toxic!

1765
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:13,040
Let's go to the other direction then, maybe.

1766
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,080
Let's go to the other direction then, maybe.

1767
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,480
Oh, this.

1768
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:20,930
If we can get to...

1769
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:21,130
If we can get to...

1770
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,830
There was like those other things.

1771
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,530
Maybe the grass grew back.

1772
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,130
Is Britney here?

1773
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:30,950
Oh!

1774
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:33,450
There's grass over here.

1775
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:33,810
There's grass.

1776
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,370
You guys, we'll live.

1777
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,590
We'll live past 15.

1778
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,270
I believe.

1779
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:39,570
I believe!

1780
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:41,650
Oh, my!

1781
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,130
Okay, don't eat all...

1782
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:44,870
Actually, you know what?

1783
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,750
I am gonna top off.

1784
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:46,750
I am gonna top off.

1785
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,030
Okay.

1786
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,910
13 years.

1787
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:56,590
You guys, we have to find a leading lady!

1788
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,050
We have to find a lovely lady!

1789
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,050
Oh, God.

1790
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,610
Why is it so toxic here?

1791
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:04,950
Wait, there was food and it disappeared!

1792
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:06,750
No!

1793
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:10,090
Food.

1794
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:11,190
Listen, listen, listen.

1795
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:12,370
Oh, my!

1796
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,310
Where is our lady?

1797
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,870
Why is it all toxic here all of a sudden?

1798
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:23,830
This game is stressing me out.

1799
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,450
Oh, it's toxic plants.

1800
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:28,010
Uh-oh.

1801
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:28,970
Don't eat that.

1802
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:30,890
Um...

1803
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,610
Do you think I'm safe here?

1804
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:33,890
If I keep running?

1805
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,110
I think it's okay.

1806
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:36,890
Uh...

1807
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:39,350
Where are ladies?

1808
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:40,630
I know.

1809
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:42,330
Females!

1810
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,410
Females!

1811
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:47,190
I'm in primating condition.

1812
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:50,130
I've eaten so many plants.

1813
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:53,490
I've...

1814
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:56,130
I'm gonna have to eat it.

1815
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,870
Oh.

1816
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:59,570
Oh, no!

1817
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,750
Oh, that really upped our toxicity.

1818
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:03,710
Oh, my gosh.

1819
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:06,150
I feel like posting on twitter.com right now.

1820
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:10,450
Oh, I feel like posting bad opinions on the internet!

1821
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:12,490
Oh, good.

1822
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:13,930
This one's not toxic.

1823
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:15,490
Umai!

1824
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:20,370
Umai!

1825
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,090
What are they?

1826
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:23,590
Oh, they're chickens.

1827
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:28,670
Oh, this area is like filled with food.

1828
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,110
I should have come here from the very beginning.

1829
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,470
What's wrong with me?

1830
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,990
What's wrong with me?

1831
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:39,150
Also, there's like a lot of animals on second stories.

1832
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:40,350
I wonder if it's all these crows.

1833
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:45,670
You guys, are we about to die?

1834
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:48,850
Can I... Oh, drink the water.

1835
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,390
Can I go upstairs, I wonder?

1836
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:51,690
Wizard status.

1837
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:55,650
Look, we've survived 15 years!

1838
01:21:58,570 --> 01:21:59,650
What's up here, anyway?

1839
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,010
Oh!

1840
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:05,130
There's just a lion.

1841
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,570
Maybe hide in the grass, man.

1842
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,150
It's not worth it.

1843
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,270
It's not worth the bite.

1844
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,630
I don't think we'll survive against that.

1845
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:22,150
Can you beat it?

1846
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,390
I'm a human.

1847
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,170
I can beat anything.

1848
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:29,270
I took over this world.

1849
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,390
I can do it again.

1850
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:32,750
Umai!

1851
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,080
Sorry.

1852
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,280
Sorry, terrier.

1853
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,440
I'm a beast.

1854
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,960
Oh, my bad.

1855
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,960
I still have that dog in me.

1856
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,720
I've survived 16 years.

1857
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:57,800
Piggies!

1858
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,060
Um, hello, piggies.

1859
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:00,960
We can share this together.

1860
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,420
What other, um...

1861
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,260
What other...

1862
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,260
challenge list?

1863
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,660
Mark 7 times.

1864
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,020
Intake 2500 calories.

1865
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,700
Head for the Yamanote Line East.

1866
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:17,100
Hahaha!

1867
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:18,780
Yamanote Line!

1868
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,160
Uh...

1869
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,100
Anything else over here?

1870
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:23,260
No.

1871
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,100
Let's go!

1872
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:36,920
Oh, my God.

1873
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:37,320
Look at me.

1874
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,980
I'm insane.

1875
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,620
Why is it so toxic here?

1876
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:52,680
The accurate IRL mint walk for this office worker is a very nice...

1877
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:55,060
Did you do the vocab for...

1878
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,600
Shut the hell up!

1879
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,200
Why is it so polluted here?

1880
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:00,920
That's a cow!

1881
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,480
You're fine.

1882
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,200
We're friends.

1883
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,860
We're friends.

1884
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,540
I'm marking my territory.

1885
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,540
Yeah, we're friends.

1886
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:14,080
We're friends.

1887
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,360
Umai!

1888
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:20,540
Umai!

1889
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,560
Touch the cow.

1890
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,380
Why do you have to be so toxic?

1891
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,300
The tears of your lips.

1892
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,640
I'm on a ride.

1893
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,820
You're toxic!

1894
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,620
There's more plants.

1895
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,320
Oh, my gosh.

1896
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,220
Get out of my way, pig.

1897
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,480
I can see the plants on the radar, but...

1898
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,760
Just some dead dogs.

1899
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:49,600
Toxic plant.

1900
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,600
Toxic plant.

1901
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,740
Good plant.

1902
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:57,940
Please, toxic.

1903
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,600
Next karaoke.

1904
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,760
Oh, my gosh.

1905
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,620
You're like really...

1906
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,780
pulling my leg here.

1907
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:08,580
Oh, my goodness.

1908
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,320
Just have...

1909
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,180
Have to have me...

1910
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:15,120
You're just like saying like... Oh, my gosh.

1911
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,640
Minto, you don't think toxic?

1912
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,380
I'm never gonna watch your streams again.

1913
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:21,460
Oh, my gosh.

1914
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,170
I guess I have to.

1915
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:24,620
If I must.

1916
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,340
Whoa, it's like really...

1917
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,940
crazy around here.

1918
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:30,520
What is that?

1919
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,340
Oh, it's chicken.

1920
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,220
Wait, why is the toxicity going up?

1921
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,700
We're in a toxic area?

1922
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:38,700
Uh-oh.

1923
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:40,760
Don't get...

1924
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,120
Don't get caught by the bagel.

1925
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:51,850
Yeah, let's go.

1926
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:52,290
Leave me alone.

1927
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:57,930
Oh, my God.

1928
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,550
Oh, God.

1929
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:00,290
I think we're in trouble.

1930
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:01,570
I think we're in trouble for real.

1931
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:03,410
Oh, okay.

1932
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,770
Get up.

1933
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:03,990
Get up.

1934
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,250
Get up.

1935
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:07,470
Oh, God.

1936
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:07,950
Oh, God.

1937
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:08,750
You guys are in trouble.

1938
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,270
We're gonna go hide in the grass.

1939
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,530
I just wanted to eat.

1940
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,330
I just wanted to eat.

1941
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:28,930
Visibility is decreased due to smog.

1942
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,270
Uh-oh, I'm gonna die.

1943
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,090
I'm gonna die here for real.

1944
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:35,030
Okay, leave me alone, hyenas.

1945
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:36,070
I'm just a little salary man.

1946
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,770
Please.

1947
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:41,990
It's so over.

1948
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,130
It's so over.

1949
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:44,490
It's so over.

1950
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:46,330
No, please.

1951
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:47,590
No.

1952
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:50,490
No, please.

1953
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:51,910
Let me eat.

1954
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,210
I just wanna eat.

1955
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:56,430
They can't find me.

1956
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,130
But I think I'm gonna die here first.

1957
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:02,430
Did they just release their...

1958
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,400
They just released...

1959
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,640
That lion just like had...

1960
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:18,160
The lion just spawned children and then unleashed them upon me.

1961
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,810
Herbivore mode is so hard.

1962
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,070
It's really hard.

1963
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:30,830
It's really hard.

1964
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,990
I think we did pretty alright.

1965
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,430
Generation change points.

1966
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,990
Human is very hard.

1967
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:48,330
High score!

1968
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,730
New monthly personal record.

1969
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:55,070
I got a world debut.

1970
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,190
Wait, how do I...

1971
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:58,710
Let me out of here.

1972
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:01,250
Oh!

1973
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,930
There I am.

1974
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:07,570
I'm 898th this month.

1975
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,270
There's over...

1976
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:12,250
How many people are playing this game?

1977
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,130
What?

1978
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:18,890
How many people are playing this game a month?

1979
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,400
What?

1980
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,700
That is actually so impressive.

1981
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:35,240
This is so impressive.

1982
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,420
I'm shocked!

1983
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:39,700
I'm shocked!

1984
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,580
And so many people are little pomeranians.

1985
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:49,520
2k people, 896 bots.

1986
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,260
Oh, wait.

1987
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,940
2 people, 896 bots.

1988
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:53,100
No!

1989
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,520
I believe in Cryptid Zero.

1990
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,980
They're a real person.

1991
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,180
And Little Miss B123.

1992
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,140
And Little Miss B123.

1993
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:04,800
Um...

1994
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,720
Hmm...

1995
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,120
Uh-huh.

1996
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,260
I just realized we didn't look at the...

1997
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:16,460
the archives that we picked up.

1998
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:17,320
But...

1999
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:20,780
But...

2000
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,560
Can I still look at them...

2001
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:24,760
like...

2002
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:25,140
afterwards?

2003
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:36,440
Ghost Bob!

2004
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,180
I have to see who number one is, you guys.

2005
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,080
Oh, wait!

2006
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,340
Start goes to first.

2007
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,840
Elvis!

2008
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,320
900!

2009
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,480
Wait a second.

2010
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:54,920
Wait, wait, wait.

2011
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:56,820
The point...

2012
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,880
The point difference...

2013
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,200
between...

2014
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:03,380
No, no, no, no.

2015
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,260
There's no way.

2016
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,200
There's no way.

2017
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,360
There's no way.

2018
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,940
I think we have a hacker on our hands.

2019
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:24,800
But also the Phantom Rice.

2020
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,650
There's me!

2021
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:40,050
Daily, I'm 83rd.

2022
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,770
This is insanity!

2023
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:41,950
Are you kidding me?

2024
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:43,970
No, Phantom Rice is first!

2025
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:48,430
That might as well be me.

2026
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,710
They love playing as the dog.

2027
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,430
Okay.

2028
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:56,790
Um...

2029
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:57,770
New game?

2030
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,550
Imagine hacking the score in this game.

2031
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:03,090
I know.

2032
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:06,210
They're not even top daily.

2033
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,190
There's no way.

2034
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,890
There's no way.

2035
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:12,530
That they're...

2036
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:14,730
That they're that high for the month.

2037
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,350
If they're not even the top for the day.

2038
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:18,670
Yeah, we're gonna use the dog this time.

2039
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:19,530
We're gonna be missile.

2040
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,120
I actually think I'm okay at this game.

2041
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,800
You can unlock other animals.

2042
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,400
And you can also buy them as DLC.

2043
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:38,220
So...

2044
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,460
I'm a dog.

2045
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,960
Look how cute I am.

2046
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:45,940
Look at me.

2047
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:46,820
Can I eat this?

2048
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:47,640
No.

2049
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:48,180
Okay.

2050
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:49,940
So now...

2051
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,660
Our goal is...

2052
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:53,500
Rabbit.

2053
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,380
We gotta eat now.

2054
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,700
Defeat two animals.

2055
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,240
Okay.

2056
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,640
I'm not even hungry.

2057
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,620
I'm just a psychopath.

2058
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:05,700
Yeah!

2059
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,960
I'm eating the crow!

2060
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:09,540
I'm eating crow!

2061
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,420
Let's mark this place as my territory.

2062
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:16,280
So we can get a cute... Oh, wait.

2063
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,360
So we can get a cute little lady.

2064
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,180
This might deplete food stocks later though.

2065
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:27,140
Maybe.

2066
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,460
Maybe.

2067
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,520
But...

2068
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,840
What are these?

2069
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:38,680
We're a dog now.

2070
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:39,620
We have nothing to fear.

2071
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,200
Not even this little tiny bird.

2072
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,140
We have nothing to fear.

2073
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,480
I can't wait to get...

2074
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:48,940
Um...

2075
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:50,740
Oh!

2076
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:53,710
Oh!

2077
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:54,730
I pressed the wrong button.

2078
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:56,090
Come here!

2079
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,070
Come here!

2080
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:58,450
Come here, bunny!

2081
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:00,090
Oh!

2082
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:00,630
Oh!

2083
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:01,250
Oh!

2084
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:02,370
I need to eat!

2085
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:03,310
Please!

2086
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:05,170
Please come home!

2087
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:07,770
Why...

2088
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,000
Survive, rabbit!

2089
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:15,700
Survive!

2090
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:16,860
Not today.

2091
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,620
Raise rank to veteran!

2092
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,280
Raw Pomeranian right now.

2093
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:27,600
Raw Pomeranian right now.

2094
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,320
Oh yeah.

2095
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:32,400
I am crazy.

2096
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:34,980
Look how high this dog can jump!

2097
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,960
This dog's kind of crazy.

2098
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:37,420
This dog's kind of crazy.

2099
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:40,520
Look how cute he is.

2100
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,020
He's so small and vicious.

2101
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,320
I love that for him.

2102
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,180
Alright, what we're trying to do is we gotta...

2103
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,580
Well, first I'm gonna...

2104
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,300
I'm gonna take this rabbit out.

2105
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,900
Got that dog in him.

2106
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,460
I think if anything, there might always be crows around here.

2107
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,240
Maybe.

2108
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,100
That's the hope at least, right?

2109
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,320
Little chicks.

2110
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,460
Always check the challenges.

2111
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,920
Let's see what our challenge is.

2112
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,840
Oh, raise rank to veteran.

2113
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,840
We can do that.

2114
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:25,830
Sorry, little chick.

2115
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:27,090
You gotta go.

2116
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:30,250
These poor guys are just trying to survive.

2117
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,030
It's a doggy dog world out there.

2118
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:35,830
It's a doggy dog world out there.

2119
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,750
Dogs gotta eat.

2120
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,490
I gotta be faster.

2121
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:39,650
Dogs gotta be...

2122
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:40,970
Come on, come on, come on.

2123
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:41,770
You were so close.

2124
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:46,330
Run, run.

2125
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,620
Let me mark this first.

2126
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:56,440
Short legs.

2127
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:00,020
They ran into each other.

2128
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:01,340
Come here.

2129
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,660
Come here.

2130
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,300
Little rabbit.

2131
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,140
I gotta eat.

2132
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:04,860
I'm gonna be hungry.

2133
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,240
Clean kill.

2134
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,280
Food is now easily perishable in the blister...

2135
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,860
Oh, this is the blistering heat.

2136
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:15,340
Oh!

2137
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:17,000
We got a magazine.

2138
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,660
My little doggy brain totally needed that.

2139
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:24,840
Can confirm Pomeranians are just like that.

2140
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,680
The song is good for bobbing my head.

2141
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:36,140
Yeah.

2142
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:40,160
We gotta get one more to be able to use the...

2143
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:42,380
the mating.

2144
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,180
And it's already almost four years.

2145
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:46,020
You guys!

2146
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,860
This is not good.

2147
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:48,520
This is not good.

2148
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:49,800
We gotta go to all the other side.

2149
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,260
All the way to the other side of Cheerio.

2150
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,600
We gotta start our generations.

2151
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:58,580
Our life.

2152
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,460
We have to mate.

2153
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,120
I'm gonna eat this bunny.

2154
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:13,570
Oh!

2155
01:36:13,570 --> 01:36:14,650
He noticed me.

2156
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,910
Smart little guy, isn't he?

2157
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:18,990
Where'd he go?

2158
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:24,230
It would be funny if they hid in grass if I couldn't see them anymore.

2159
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,170
For real.

2160
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,630
If it was like...

2161
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,650
exactly as it is.

2162
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:31,370
As if the hunters are looking for me.

2163
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,370
Dang, this bunny is fast.

2164
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:36,470
Oh, they're coming back around.

2165
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,110
Oh!

2166
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,450
Our attack went up!

2167
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,490
Nice!

2168
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:54,960
Okay.

2169
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,180
There's a lady.

2170
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,660
You can now use the Cheerio station.

2171
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:07,720
Hello!

2172
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,060
Lady!

2173
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:11,920
She's in love with me.

2174
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,280
She's obsessed with me.

2175
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:14,840
She wants to mate with me.

2176
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:16,760
Who wouldn't?

2177
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,140
Come on, mama.

2178
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,720
Let's go have some pups.

2179
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:26,940
Ara ara.

2180
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,960
Are you guys ready for this?

2181
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,280
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

2182
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:34,580
Don't do it!

2183
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,550
Look at all our little dogs!

2184
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:43,450
Happy birthday, Pomeranian 2!

2185
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,530
Form a pack.

2186
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,270
In the event of your death, control will switch to a pack mate.

2187
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:51,770
You can also order pack mates to fight by holding the triangle button.

2188
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:53,250
Okay.

2189
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:54,270
Oh!

2190
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:56,370
Wait, how do I switch to old dog?

2191
01:37:56,650 --> 01:37:58,550
You cannot use your parents' nest.

2192
01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:00,450
So I'm just a baby?

2193
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,250
I'm just a little baby?

2194
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:03,410
Baby?

2195
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:10,860
Oh, wait.

2196
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:13,300
Oh, I guess I thought the triangles...

2197
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:17,340
Or I thought the little dots were something below.

2198
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,940
But I guess it makes sense.

2199
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:23,340
Don't forget to save.

2200
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:24,760
Oh, yeah.

2201
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,480
But I can't... Oh, next pack...

2202
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,600
Next nest will have to save.

2203
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,840
Who am I... Yeah, who am I mating with?

2204
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,260
Wait a second...

2205
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:37,080
Who am I?

2206
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,060
Come on, guys!

2207
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:41,840
Be faster!

2208
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,360
Come on!

2209
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,100
It's a doggy dog world!

2210
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:52,130
With your pack.

2211
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:52,990
No!

2212
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:56,690
Maybe I should have gone the other way.

2213
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:57,950
This way is really far.

2214
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:00,410
Typically, it tends to be...

2215
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:02,530
poisoned.

2216
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:04,610
No!

2217
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:05,090
No!

2218
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,890
We're gonna find another suitable lady.

2219
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:11,250
Oh, good.

2220
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:12,950
There's some food up here.

2221
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:15,050
There's some...

2222
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:16,790
Wait, what is that?

2223
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:19,270
Is that a dog?

2224
01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:19,830
Uh-oh.

2225
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,550
You guys, I don't know if we can take this guy on.

2226
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:25,390
Do you think we can?

2227
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,260
Oh, we killed a wolf!

2228
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:36,460
Oh, we killed a wolf!

2229
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,420
It's too heavy to eat.

2230
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:39,200
Or to lift.

2231
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:39,580
What do you mean?

2232
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,160
Just eat it!

2233
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,000
What are you talking about?

2234
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:42,480
Just...

2235
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,680
Just eat it!

2236
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,120
Oh, no.

2237
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,720
No!

2238
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,700
There's nothing else here!

2239
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,300
I hear some crows, but...

2240
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:02,150
I can't...

2241
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:02,590
Oh, gosh.

2242
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:03,090
I'm hungry.

2243
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:05,970
Uh-oh.

2244
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:09,290
Why is it so...

2245
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:10,730
What?

2246
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:17,790
Chomp him!

2247
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,610
Chomp him down!

2248
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:20,250
Yes!

2249
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:21,010
Yes!

2250
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:21,450
Eat!

2251
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:22,810
Eat him!

2252
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:23,350
Eat him up!

2253
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:26,770
It's a dog-eat-dog world!

2254
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:30,290
What if that was the saying the whole time?

2255
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:36,830
What's over here?

2256
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:38,690
Oh, just little baby birds.

2257
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:39,750
Come here.

2258
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:41,570
Come here, chick.

2259
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:43,010
I gotta eat you.

2260
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:43,430
I'm sorry.

2261
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:50,470
Chomp him down!

2262
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:51,370
Chomp him down!

2263
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:52,390
Oh!

2264
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,550
We get...

2265
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:55,130
A stamina jerky!

2266
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:05,190
This is a cruel world.

2267
01:41:05,690 --> 01:41:07,210
It absolutely is.

2268
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:09,930
Nothing down here, right?

2269
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:10,610
Oh!

2270
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:11,530
Okay.

2271
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:12,470
We gotta be...

2272
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:13,370
This is where the...

2273
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:15,570
We're big dogs!

2274
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,650
I just noticed we turned into big dogs!

2275
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:22,170
Oh, wow.

2276
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:23,210
There's a lot going on here.

2277
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:24,030
There's monkeys.

2278
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:27,810
Clean kill!

2279
01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:30,670
The monkeys are afraid of us, though.

2280
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:31,250
Because we're...

2281
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,470
We're so ferocious.

2282
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:34,350
We're a ferocious little pack.

2283
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:35,790
Yes, we are.

2284
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:38,550
Oh my gosh.

2285
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:39,570
They keep eating.

2286
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,190
Hell yeah!

2287
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:43,930
We got a flirty...

2288
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,590
Costumes grant the wearer a variety of effects.

2289
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,470
Anyone can just get by.

2290
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:50,590
The top dog survives in style.

2291
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:52,610
Change items through the menu screen.

2292
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:53,570
No way!

2293
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:55,730
Wait.

2294
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:56,870
Items.

2295
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:00,430
Flirty frames!

2296
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:03,690
Sets heart athrob with these sexy spreads.

2297
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:10,750
Missile!

2298
01:42:13,130 --> 01:42:15,090
You have me twirling my hair.

2299
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:16,570
You're so flirty.

2300
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,190
Wait.

2301
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,710
What was that?

2302
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:20,690
Again?

2303
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:23,890
I think it was...

2304
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:25,490
A click up, right?

2305
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:27,990
Just skimming through will fills you with pep.

2306
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:29,190
And then...

2307
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:31,210
Halts stamina loss for a long while.

2308
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:31,810
Nice!

2309
01:42:34,530 --> 01:42:35,110
Magazine!

2310
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:38,190
Get out of here, monkeys!

2311
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:44,220
Didn't even notice a thing.

2312
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,320
This stupid goat.

2313
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:47,240
You dumb goat.

2314
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:48,260
You stupid goat.

2315
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:54,190
Are you hungry or something?

2316
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:55,550
Why are you standing so close to me?

2317
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,270
This is my food.

2318
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:58,550
Get your own kill.

2319
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:02,510
Okay, we need to find...

2320
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,630
Oh, it looks like it's down here.

2321
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:04,430
The other...

2322
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:10,110
The other...

2323
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:10,570
Ooh.

2324
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,670
Wait, where are we?

2325
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:14,150
Just kidding.

2326
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:17,130
I thought I knew where we were.

2327
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:19,270
And in honesty, I have no idea.

2328
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:21,330
Wait, where are we going?

2329
01:43:21,330 --> 01:43:22,790
We're trying to find...

2330
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:23,450
Ah!

2331
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:26,390
Oh, he ran away from us.

2332
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:26,910
Yeah!

2333
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:28,270
Get his ass!

2334
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:29,170
Get his ass!

2335
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:32,830
Jackal!

2336
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:37,440
I'm trying to...

2337
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,280
You're in Tokyo.

2338
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:39,420
Oh, thank you.

2339
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:44,700
Why are a pack of Pomeranians so cute but terrifying?

2340
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:45,380
I know.

2341
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:47,100
Ah!

2342
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,360
Good thing there's not fall damage in this.

2343
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:54,920
I'm trying to... I'm trying to mark the rest of the area, but...

2344
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,000
Hey there, monkeys.

2345
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:01,860
Let's see.

2346
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:07,020
Huh, maybe I do have to keep going.

2347
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:12,120
The flag icon is on the map.

2348
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:12,540
Yeah.

2349
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,980
Is there a way to zoom in here?

2350
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:15,320
No.

2351
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:17,580
So...

2352
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,560
I just have to keep going to the right then.

2353
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:21,100
Never mind.

2354
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:22,320
I was right the first time.

2355
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,160
Head for Shibuya Shop District.

2356
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:27,960
Head for Shibuya Shop District.

2357
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:31,060
I'm letting him live because I don't want his pack to...

2358
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,500
Triangle of Zoom?

2359
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,200
Oh, you're so right.

2360
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:34,920
Thank you, guys.

2361
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,060
Oh, Shibuya Shop District?

2362
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:40,900
It's so far!

2363
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,480
There's an event in the Shibuya suburbs.

2364
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:51,280
Maybe we should turn around.

2365
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:52,180
Okay.

2366
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:54,580
Let's turn around.

2367
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:55,080
Let's turn around.

2368
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:58,100
Before we go, though...

2369
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,280
I'm taking this monkey down.

2370
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:02,620
Sorry, guy.

2371
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:04,780
Oh, no!

2372
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,060
What are you talking about?

2373
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,240
Why can't I just eat him?

2374
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,400
Too heavy to lift my butt.

2375
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,340
I mean, my butt's not that big.

2376
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:13,960
But...

2377
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:15,820
You get what I'm saying.

2378
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,540
Okay.

2379
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,440
Uh...

2380
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,520
Oh, no.

2381
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:23,940
No, no.

2382
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:24,840
It's too toxic.

2383
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:25,540
Too toxic.

2384
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:27,380
It's too toxic.

2385
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,380
Toxicity is increasing!

2386
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,120
We gotta get out of here, you guys.

2387
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:35,840
There's no food here.

2388
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:39,360
Uh-oh.

2389
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,880
Am I gonna be in trouble?

2390
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:42,660
Gosh.

2391
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:43,360
Oh, no.

2392
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:43,720
We're good.

2393
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:44,200
We're good.

2394
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,560
Oh, shoot.

2395
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:47,200
Come here.

2396
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:50,060
Took him out.

2397
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,560
We're eating him.

2398
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:52,860
What?

2399
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,360
Oh, my gosh.

2400
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:55,860
What's wrong with us?

2401
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:00,020
I'm just realizing now, too, how fast the hunger went for the human.

2402
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:03,840
Like, our hunger is actually quite slow for the dog.

2403
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:04,960
Oh, gosh.

2404
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,880
But we're really in trouble.

2405
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,040
What's down here?

2406
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:08,240
Take the risk.

2407
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,120
Oh, my gosh.

2408
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:11,640
I missed him.

2409
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:12,140
I missed...

2410
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,520
Take the risk!

2411
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:17,060
Come on!

2412
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,640
Oh, shit.

2413
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:20,980
Oh, shit.

2414
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,880
I can't die here!

2415
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:23,680
I can't die here!

2416
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:28,320
Please!

2417
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,920
Let me eat you!

2418
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:35,060
Uh, I think we're gonna die.

2419
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,600
I think we're about to die.

2420
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,500
Oh, gosh.

2421
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,080
Oh, no!

2422
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,060
We went to dog...

2423
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:47,060
Oh, my God.

2424
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:47,600
I'm so sorry.

2425
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:49,080
Your death won't be in vain.

2426
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:50,700
I'll eat your body.

2427
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:51,500
Okay, never mind.

2428
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:54,780
I can't eat him.

2429
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:58,280
Even though he's my brother.

2430
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,300
Let me eat my brother!

2431
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:05,620
Let me eat him!

2432
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,600
Eat him?

2433
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:08,260
Eat?

2434
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:09,600
Why won't you...

2435
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,800
Oh, okay.

2436
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,420
Why are we picking him up?

2437
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:15,500
I'm marking.

2438
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,820
There's the last mark!

2439
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:19,180
Finally!

2440
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:19,300
Finally!

2441
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:21,080
Oh, there we go.

2442
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:27,700
Oh, we have to go, mate.

2443
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,100
I see some...

2444
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,600
I see some willing...

2445
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:33,700
participants.

2446
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,480
I can sometimes...

2447
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:41,920
Oh, my gosh.

2448
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:43,560
There we go.

2449
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,620
Sometimes I gotta go in for the attack more so...

2450
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:47,220
You know?

2451
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,300
Nice.

2452
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,160
We're a veteran, so...

2453
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,200
I think the lovely ladies...

2454
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,360
Oh, don't look at him.

2455
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,900
Don't look at him.

2456
01:47:59,040 --> 01:47:59,460
Wait!

2457
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,320
The desperate female.

2458
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,500
Dirty animals, you!

2459
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:04,980
Touch may pass you.

2460
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:05,980
They are fleas.

2461
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:09,200
Fleas itch so badly that you'll sometimes be paralyzed.

2462
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:11,180
Bathe in some water or take medicine...

2463
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:11,840
to get rid of them.

2464
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:12,720
Oh, we have medicine.

2465
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:16,460
Restore...

2466
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:16,800
Oh, wait.

2467
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,780
I have fleas!

2468
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,260
This bitch!

2469
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:23,280
You gave me fleas, you dirty dog!

2470
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,920
I can't believe you!

2471
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,440
I can't believe you!

2472
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:29,620
This is what desperation...

2473
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:30,040
happens.

2474
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:32,760
This is...

2475
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:33,520
Oh, my God.

2476
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,260
Worth?

2477
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:43,570
No, there's water right here.

2478
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:44,270
We're okay.

2479
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:45,690
Drink the water.

2480
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:48,030
I have no longer have fleas.

2481
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,270
Alright, desperate female.

2482
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:51,010
Come on.

2483
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:54,990
She wants me so bad.

2484
01:48:55,330 --> 01:48:56,050
She wants me so bad.

2485
01:48:59,830 --> 01:49:01,610
I was wondering what the black heart...

2486
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:03,710
I thought it meant she was gonna like...

2487
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:04,530
I don't know.

2488
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:05,770
I thought she was like a...

2489
01:49:07,150 --> 01:49:09,010
She was gonna break my heart or something.

2490
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:09,410
You know?

2491
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:12,830
Never settle, you guys.

2492
01:49:16,330 --> 01:49:17,270
What's this over here?

2493
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:19,510
Oh, a rabbit.

2494
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:23,050
No, we're gonna go make some babies.

2495
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:26,070
Oh, shoot.

2496
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:27,450
Where'd he go?

2497
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:29,530
Can I eat this now?

2498
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:30,790
Oh, nice!

2499
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,410
Not nice!

2500
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:34,270
Stop eating!

2501
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:36,130
Hey, who are you?

2502
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:38,410
Oh.

2503
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:40,070
You wanna...

2504
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:41,230
Oh, no.

2505
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:42,930
I think this was the other dog.

2506
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:45,390
I think this was the better dog.

2507
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:51,190
We'll be fine.

2508
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:55,050
Let's go eat some of these guys right here.

2509
01:49:58,910 --> 01:49:59,350
Let's go eat some of these guys right here.

2510
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:08,570
I think if I hold down... oh, that's when it's telling me...

2511
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:11,470
Do you think my parents are okay?

2512
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:12,430
I just realized.

2513
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:13,530
I haven't seen them in a while.

2514
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:17,850
Do you think my parents are alright?

2515
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,860
Do I have to... I'm gonna first save.

2516
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:26,800
Save the game, yes.

2517
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:29,760
They probably died!

2518
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,960
They're in dog heaven.

2519
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:42,080
Is Mint a desperate?

2520
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:42,580
No!

2521
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:46,800
Oh.

2522
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,260
Um...

2523
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:50,660
A new archive has been added.

2524
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,140
Continue.

2525
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:54,920
Oh, it just took me out of the game.

2526
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:55,440
That's so funny.

2527
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:00,520
When I saved, it took me out of the game.

2528
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:03,780
Save and quit.

2529
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,200
Not just save.

2530
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:07,860
No hard save.

2531
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:08,580
Got it.

2532
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:10,360
That's okay.

2533
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:11,340
We're still mating.

2534
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:13,040
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2535
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:14,600
We are mating.

2536
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:15,360
There we go.

2537
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:17,520
Open up!

2538
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:19,960
Oh my god, my brothers are watching.

2539
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:21,640
My brothers are watching.

2540
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,500
We have a baby!

2541
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,160
Happy birthday, Pomeranian 3!

2542
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,300
What's in the... what's in the...

2543
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,190
Wait, there's only two of us.

2544
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:36,770
Uh-oh.

2545
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:38,130
Uh-oh.

2546
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:43,390
The desperate female didn't produce enough.

2547
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:45,110
What if I die?

2548
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:46,910
There's only one of us then.

2549
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:48,190
Wait, mom!

2550
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:51,150
Wait, you guys need to make more!

2551
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:54,030
You cannot use your parents' nest.

2552
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,210
Okay.

2553
01:52:00,210 --> 01:52:02,430
What happened to my other brothers, though?

2554
01:52:02,490 --> 01:52:03,230
What happened to them?

2555
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:07,150
Lower quality women give less babies.

2556
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:08,170
No way.

2557
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:10,910
This is so messed up.

2558
01:52:11,130 --> 01:52:12,150
Goodbye, parents!

2559
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:13,910
I'll probably never see you again.

2560
01:52:13,950 --> 01:52:15,630
You'll probably be dead by the time I'm back here.

2561
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:18,470
But, um...

2562
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:21,310
Just wanted to say...

2563
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:23,470
Thanks for...

2564
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:26,210
Thanks for a good life, maybe.

2565
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,600
Yeah.

2566
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,400
Eat that rabbit.

2567
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:39,400
Lessons have been learned.

2568
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:41,020
Wait, are we already a big dog?

2569
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,180
That was fast.

2570
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:43,600
No, we're still small.

2571
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,020
It's kind of hard to tell sometimes.

2572
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,380
We're still tiny to pop, right?

2573
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,240
Oh!

2574
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:52,780
Hell yeah.

2575
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,820
Why did you say open up?

2576
01:52:58,860 --> 01:52:59,420
Your heart!

2577
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:01,040
Open up your heart to me!

2578
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,040
So that we can make sweet love.

2579
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,080
What are you talking about?

2580
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:18,360
Oh, the heart.

2581
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,440
Yes!

2582
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,280
The heart!

2583
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,660
What are you talking about?

2584
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:24,260
Uh-oh.

2585
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,240
Toxic here.

2586
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:33,260
Now...

2587
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:34,380
Poor guys.

2588
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:37,560
They just...

2589
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:38,640
They just...

2590
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,140
They just wanted to be good.

2591
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:45,620
Hey, where's my brother?

2592
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:45,900
Okay.

2593
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:48,420
What is that?

2594
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,200
What is this?

2595
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,260
Oh, it's like a bison or something.

2596
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:55,000
A buffalo.

2597
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,080
Oh, R1!

2598
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,660
Oh, he's really agile.

2599
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:02,740
Oh my God.

2600
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:03,380
Oh my God.

2601
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:03,960
Uh-oh.

2602
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:04,820
I think we're in trouble.

2603
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:06,740
Holy cow!

2604
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:07,640
Holy...

2605
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,440
No, holy buffalo!

2606
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,520
I think we're in trouble.

2607
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,780
Let's get out of here, brother.

2608
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,180
Let's get out of here, brother.

2609
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,740
I thought I was going to kill him.

2610
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,180
But I did not kill him.

2611
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:20,540
We're still in 100% danger.

2612
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:21,980
We're in less danger.

2613
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:23,140
I'm going to mark this area.

2614
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:23,720
Okay.

2615
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,200
It's mine now.

2616
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,080
We're in trouble.

2617
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,560
This is my area.

2618
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,620
This is...

2619
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:33,760
This is my home.

2620
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,620
This is not your home.

2621
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:38,500
Oh gosh.

2622
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:39,360
Oh gosh.

2623
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:40,460
Oh my God.

2624
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:40,900
Oh my God.

2625
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:41,160
Oh my God.

2626
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:41,380
Brother!

2627
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:42,560
Brother!

2628
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:43,120
Brother!

2629
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:44,800
Brother,

2630
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,380
I think we're in trouble.

2631
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:51,080
Brother.

2632
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:53,140
Brother, I think we must leave this place.

2633
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:54,120
Never return.

2634
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:55,080
Brother.

2635
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:55,880
Brother.

2636
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,420
Brother, I thought we could kill the buffalo.

2637
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:00,080
I thought we could just get his jugular and make it.

2638
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,140
Why are you going the same speed as me?

2639
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:09,610
I think we're in trouble.

2640
01:55:11,490 --> 01:55:11,890
Fail.

2641
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:15,250
I'm trying to live.

2642
01:55:15,310 --> 01:55:15,950
I'm trying to survive.

2643
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,640
There's no failing as long as I'm alive, bitch.

2644
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:22,400
Oh no.

2645
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:23,100
I'm about to die.

2646
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:23,800
Oh no.

2647
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,440
I'm about to die.

2648
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,080
Brother!

2649
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:27,980
It's up to you, brother.

2650
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:28,680
Please.

2651
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:31,700
Oh, the buffalo.

2652
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:31,760
The buffalo.

2653
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:33,020
The buffalo don't have beef with the brother though.

2654
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:38,430
Our territory.

2655
01:55:40,730 --> 01:55:43,090
The buffalo don't have beef with the brother though.

2656
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:44,190
I think we're okay.

2657
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:46,450
Oh, we're not.

2658
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:46,710
Okay.

2659
01:55:46,870 --> 01:55:47,350
Oh my God.

2660
01:55:47,390 --> 01:55:48,110
Why did I come back?

2661
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:49,130
Why did I come back?

2662
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,380
Ghost trick time.

2663
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:09,960
So true.

2664
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,300
So true.

2665
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:20,720
Load the save.

2666
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:21,720
Wait.

2667
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:22,440
Actually though.

2668
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:23,740
I wonder if we should.

2669
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,200
19,000 points.

2670
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,920
That's going to put me in the leaderboards, baby.

2671
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:29,920
High score.

2672
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:33,740
You had to go back.

2673
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:34,960
I wanted the territory.

2674
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,540
Oh, it deletes it?

2675
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:39,960
Seriously?

2676
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,180
That's crazy.

2677
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,260
Where am I at?

2678
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:47,140
760.

2679
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:47,440
760.

2680
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:50,900
Put me above Mr. Bios, come on.

2681
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,200
Put me above.

2682
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,500
Put me above.

2683
01:56:55,640 --> 01:57:01,500
I know we're tied but my name comes first in the alphabet.

2684
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,680
This is so rude.

2685
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:08,380
Asshols.

2686
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:18,990
At least you're above asshawks.

2687
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:25,310
Is it because he's a doctor?

2688
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,280
I'm not a doctor.

2689
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:33,000
Oh no, I really did delete it.

2690
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:33,300
Wow.

2691
01:57:35,180 --> 01:57:36,060
Oh my gosh.

2692
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:45,220
What is multiplayer like?

2693
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:50,190
Hello, Mint.

2694
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:50,730
Love this game.

2695
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,810
Was once top 4 for daily score.

2696
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,470
Here's a tip.

2697
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:58,870
Always go for high quality females as they have bigger litters, more lives, and the next gen inherits more stats.

2698
01:57:58,970 --> 01:57:59,350
Have fun.

2699
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:00,690
Thank you, Arb.

2700
01:58:00,850 --> 01:58:04,270
I think I learned my lesson after our desperate female.

2701
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:12,970
I think before I even realized she was desperate, it happened, you know?

2702
01:58:13,410 --> 01:58:14,950
What are the stats on the human?

2703
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,650
I just realized.

2704
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:16,450
Woo!

2705
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:18,530
They're actually quite high.

2706
01:58:20,350 --> 01:58:22,610
Look at the different palm colors.

2707
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:24,150
I want to be an elephant.

2708
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:27,750
I want to be... I want to be...

2709
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,870
Oh my gosh, what is it called?

2710
01:58:28,990 --> 01:58:29,750
Not an elephant.

2711
01:58:30,670 --> 01:58:31,630
The prehistoric.

2712
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:34,630
What is it called?

2713
01:58:37,290 --> 01:58:37,770
Mammoth!

2714
01:58:37,970 --> 01:58:39,350
I want to be a mammoth.

2715
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:41,230
Thank you.

2716
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:50,370
This game also saves stats so you can breed lion hunting palms if you play enough.

2717
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:51,010
What?

2718
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:51,530
That's crazy.

2719
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:54,830
I think all females are high quality, actually.

2720
01:58:56,290 --> 01:58:58,350
Mr. Uncle, you're so right.

2721
01:58:59,130 --> 01:59:00,350
You're so right.

2722
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:03,170
How is there a mammoth?

2723
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:04,350
Look, there's even dinosaurs.

2724
01:59:04,850 --> 01:59:05,150
Oh, wait.

2725
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:07,110
Where are they?

2726
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:07,370
Here!

2727
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:09,730
There's even dino... Look at the speed!

2728
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:12,530
Oh my god!

2729
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:14,650
That's probably a velociraptor, right?

2730
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:15,750
Oh my god!

2731
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,950
Holy cow!

2732
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:19,290
The thing is crazy!

2733
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:23,890
Oh my god!

2734
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:25,690
Oh wait, maybe not.

2735
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:29,410
Dino... not dino...

2736
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:31,190
Dino... chungus.

2737
01:59:37,540 --> 01:59:40,760
The hippo seems pretty crazy, not gonna lie.

2738
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:45,780
The hippo would be a formidable foe, I believe.

2739
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,540
Dino chungus.

2740
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:50,660
I wonder if we unlocked any story.

2741
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,040
Let's check!

2742
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,470
Story.

2743
01:59:59,170 --> 02:00:01,110
Not a single one.

2744
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:03,150
Nope.

2745
02:00:05,670 --> 02:00:06,390
That's okay.

2746
02:00:06,650 --> 02:00:09,250
I'm very curious about the archives, actually.

2747
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:10,370
We did collect some, right?

2748
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,110
Zookeeper Record 1.

2749
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:14,630
February 8th, 2027.

2750
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:20,390
That's just a few years away, you guys.

2751
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:24,290
The zoo animals have been restless recently.

2752
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:27,450
The fierce predators are particularly on edge.

2753
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:29,430
And fights are often breaking out between...

2754
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:30,870
Between them!

2755
02:00:31,710 --> 02:00:32,190
Huh!

2756
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:35,290
Feeding time has become quite frightening.

2757
02:00:35,530 --> 02:00:38,750
I think I'll talk to our vet about administering some tranquilizers.

2758
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:42,490
Veterinary Report.

2759
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:46,050
I've never seen the animals in such an agitated state while I've been at the zoo.

2760
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:51,830
I don't know what could be causing this, but one theory is that they've ingested some sort of chemical that agitates them.

2761
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:54,970
Making them turn much more savage than before.

2762
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:58,690
Please check again to see if there's been any change to their diet.

2763
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:02,250
That's it.

2764
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:05,230
So was it the animals?

2765
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,430
Did the animals sense something was happening?

2766
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:10,650
Or was it the animals that caused human extinction?

2767
02:01:16,490 --> 02:01:19,770
To unlock story chapters, play Survival and collect the archives on the map.

2768
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:21,250
You can see where they are by zooming out.

2769
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:22,010
Oh, thank you!

2770
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:22,970
Thanks, Jana.

2771
02:01:23,190 --> 02:01:25,110
Well, if we read them...

2772
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,730
Did then we unlock it?

2773
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:27,810
Nope.

2774
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:30,870
Okay, we need more article... or more archives, it seems.

2775
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:34,610
More archives, more archives.

2776
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:40,460
But...

2777
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:45,380
I'll be honest, guys.

2778
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:46,840
I think I'm gonna call it here.

2779
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:49,480
I know it's a really, really, really short stream.

2780
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:51,800
But...

2781
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:58,740
I said at the beginning of the stream that I have a meeting that I have to get ready for tonight.

2782
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,860
It's kind of a late night meeting, so...

2783
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:03,460
But this was a fun...

2784
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:05,360
I definitely will want to revisit this.

2785
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:06,100
I think I...

2786
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,060
It's very interesting.

2787
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:09,840
But...

2788
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,340
So we'll play it again at some time.

2789
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:15,280
It was a good...

2790
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:18,040
Good introduction, rather.

2791
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:19,860
Maybe I can buy some more animals.

2792
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:23,300
To have for next time, too.

2793
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:25,360
Would love a story mode playthrough.

2794
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:26,120
Yeah, right!

2795
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:26,600
Me too!

2796
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,760
This is a really unique game.

2797
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:29,300
It is!

2798
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:30,040
It's so fun.

2799
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:30,940
I like that it's...

2800
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:31,700
It's...

2801
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:33,660
Almost roguelike.

2802
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:34,360
In that...

2803
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:34,900
Like...

2804
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:35,880
You have to...

2805
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:36,660
You know...

2806
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:38,020
Start over every time.

2807
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:39,900
If you die.

2808
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:41,420
Short, but it was a very fun stream.

2809
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:41,820
Thank you.

2810
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:42,320
Thanks, Gal!

2811
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,440
Thank you, thank you.

2812
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:45,200
This game looks weirdly addicting.

2813
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:45,560
I know!

2814
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:46,460
I can already...

2815
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,860
Like, I already want to keep going.

2816
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:49,680
But...

2817
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:51,140
I'm gonna hold off.

2818
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:53,540
Just because...

2819
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:56,260
I think I've overworked myself a little bit.

2820
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:56,980
And so I'm like...

2821
02:02:56,980 --> 02:02:58,560
I should rest a little bit, maybe.

2822
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,040
Thanks so much for streaming!

2823
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:00,900
This was hilarious.

2824
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:01,760
Thank you!

2825
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:09,520
Any games are roguelike if you keep hitting the restart button.

2826
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:11,600
So true!

2827
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:15,340
Try out other old PS3 games, maybe.

2828
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:17,560
Many niche, unique games in the past.

2829
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,560
And since I have my PS3...

2830
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,820
The world is our oyster.

2831
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:23,520
I can play whatever I want!

2832
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:24,480
If I wanna...

2833
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:24,880
I...

2834
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,220
I've wanted to play this for some time.

2835
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:28,000
Um...

2836
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,440
So...

2837
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,300
I'm glad that I can finally play it now.

2838
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:30,880
Because...

2839
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:31,480
Like I said...

2840
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:34,460
You can only play it on the PS3.

2841
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:36,160
So...

2842
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:37,660
Thank you!

2843
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,100
Have you heard about this game?

2844
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:39,440
Oh!

2845
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:40,340
Heard about this game.

2846
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:41,900
But I've never seen it in action.

2847
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,520
Looks really fun.

2848
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,420
And a little brutal.

2849
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:44,480
Have fun with Doki.

2850
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:45,500
Tomorrow...

2851
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:45,720
Yes!

2852
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:48,020
Tomorrow I'm collabing with Doki!

2853
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:51,680
We're playing a horror Kusouge.

2854
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:52,800
So...

2855
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,760
I'm excited about that.

2856
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,420
Can't believe they never ported this to PS4.

2857
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:57,200
I really like this game.

2858
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,340
I really feel like this game could...

2859
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:00,260
I wonder if it's the...

2860
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:00,720
Uh...

2861
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:04,140
If it's the trademark stuff.

2862
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,000
For some of the businesses in...

2863
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:06,660
In the game.

2864
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:09,300
I wonder.

2865
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:13,700
Um...

2866
02:04:16,260 --> 02:04:17,060
I don't know.

2867
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:18,920
Hmm.

2868
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:22,000
This game in MGS4 needs remasters.

2869
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:22,580
So true.

2870
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:24,760
It's on PlayStation Plus too.

2871
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,520
I've played it on PS4.

2872
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:26,860
I swear.

2873
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:27,180
It's on PS4.

2874
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:27,480
Oh, really?

2875
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:27,880
Oh.

2876
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:30,880
But maybe it's not as special as I thought it was.

2877
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:33,140
Submit...

2878
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:35,960
When will you make OG slash cover song?

2879
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:38,900
I don't know.

2880
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:39,820
Honestly?

2881
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:42,040
I...

2882
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:42,280
I...

2883
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:43,500
I...

2884
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,100
I...

2885
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:44,280
I...

2886
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,700
I have no confidence.

2887
02:04:50,980 --> 02:04:51,460
So...

2888
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:52,400
I don't know.

2889
02:04:52,460 --> 02:04:53,320
I have some old...

2890
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:53,700
Old...

2891
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:55,320
Really old cover songs.

2892
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,180
If you ever want to listen to some old cover songs.

2893
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:58,000
They're...

2894
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,860
They're like four years old.

2895
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:00,420
But that's okay.

2896
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:03,300
Um...

2897
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:06,100
But maybe one day I'll have an original song.

2898
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:08,220
Maybe if I have the confidence.

2899
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:11,440
We'll see.

2900
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:12,300
We'll see.

2901
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:15,920
Have confidence.

2902
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:17,180
A certain doggo.

2903
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,300
Quoted by a certain doggo.

2904
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:20,200
Yeah.

2905
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,680
Um...

2906
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:22,240
But we'll see.

2907
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:24,080
Hmm...

2908
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:24,700
Hmm...

2909
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:25,160
Hmm...

2910
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:25,680
Hmm...

2911
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:26,140
Hmm...

2912
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:26,660
Hmm...

2913
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,140
Hmm...

2914
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,400
Yeah.

2915
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:31,960
So...

2916
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:32,440
I'm sorry.

2917
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:32,960
I feel...

2918
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,320
I just realized that I only...

2919
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:34,660
You know what?

2920
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,360
Maybe I can play a little bit longer.

2921
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:37,280
Because I feel like...

2922
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,260
I only did like...

2923
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,480
An hour and a half of gameplay.

2924
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:41,040
Because I spent a half hour talking.

2925
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:46,660
What...

2926
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:47,260
What do you guys think?

2927
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:47,880
One more run?

2928
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:53,060
Should we do one more run?

2929
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:58,720
No need to push yourself.

2930
02:05:58,900 --> 02:05:59,060
Fine.

2931
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,840
If you don't want to watch me...

2932
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:00,880
I'll do it.

2933
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,320
I'll leave.

2934
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,120
I'll leave.

2935
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,140
I'll leave.

2936
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:10,180
I'll leave.

2937
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:11,340
I'll leave.

2938
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:12,580
I'll leave.

2939
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,020
I'll leave.

2940
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:16,080
I'll leave.

2941
02:06:16,660 --> 02:06:16,860
I'll leave.

2942
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:16,940
I'll leave.

2943
02:06:16,940 --> 02:06:17,000
I'll leave.

2944
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,360
I'll leave.

2945
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:17,580
I'll leave.

2946
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:17,800
I'll leave.

2947
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:19,060
I'll leave.

2948
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,800
I'll leave.

2949
02:06:26,620 --> 02:06:28,060
I'll leave.

2950
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,680
One more, one more, one more!

2951
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:51,620
Instead of one more run, another 30 minutes of yapping.

2952
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:52,320
Stop!

2953
02:06:53,620 --> 02:06:55,000
No, I want to play the game.

2954
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:56,640
Should I try the deer though?

2955
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,080
No, I think I'm gonna go with the dog.

2956
02:06:58,420 --> 02:06:59,380
Let's go with missile.

2957
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:02,040
I changed my mind so quickly.

2958
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:04,500
I made up my mind so easily.

2959
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,260
One more ghost of it!

2960
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:08,400
Thank you for the akasuma.

2961
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:08,880
Thank you!

2962
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:12,980
This time...

2963
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:18,900
This time we won't mess it up.

2964
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:27,040
Clean kill.

2965
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,740
They don't know that I'm a predator.

2966
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,900
She loves us but we hate her.

2967
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:39,180
Okay.

2968
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,000
Look at that.

2969
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:48,260
Look at that turkey go.

2970
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:51,580
And let's mark here.

2971
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,800
Oh, there's a dog in here.

2972
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:57,900
It's okay, I took him out.

2973
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:00,800
This is my territory, other dog!

2974
02:08:06,490 --> 02:08:07,010
Turkey.

2975
02:08:07,470 --> 02:08:07,990
Yeah.

2976
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:09,090
Flea shampoo!

2977
02:08:09,810 --> 02:08:10,610
Very good.

2978
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:13,270
But we won't get fleas this time.

2979
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:16,150
We're gonna find a lovely, lovely lady.

2980
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:17,650
What is this?

2981
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:19,130
What is the point of this part?

2982
02:08:19,130 --> 02:08:20,930
Like the scraps there.

2983
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:21,850
I wonder.

2984
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:25,370
What?

2985
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:28,370
There's here?

2986
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:31,110
Will this mark all of this area or no?

2987
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,310
No, we still need one more.

2988
02:08:35,370 --> 02:08:36,590
Noise alert of...

2989
02:08:36,590 --> 02:08:38,070
I see, I see.

2990
02:08:38,850 --> 02:08:40,330
I can also jump!

2991
02:08:45,030 --> 02:08:46,590
Jumping doesn't even use stamina.

2992
02:08:46,590 --> 02:08:46,870
I'm gonna...

2993
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:54,880
I think it even makes me faster.

2994
02:08:57,680 --> 02:08:58,700
Not so bad.

2995
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,800
I'm gonna take a little sippy.

2996
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,380
Oops, I always do that.

2997
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,620
Okay nice.

2998
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:08,080
Let's keep going.

2999
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:14,670
Come on, let me eat you!

3000
02:09:16,530 --> 02:09:18,190
Come on, let me eat!

3001
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:24,380
Oh my god.

3002
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:26,380
Oh my god, the cries are so sad!

3003
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:28,540
The cries for help.

3004
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:31,240
Actually, I think I just realized I need to level up.

3005
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,380
We're still a rookie.

3006
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,220
We're a level 1 crook.

3007
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:41,460
We need to be higher.

3008
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:43,440
Oh my god, the rabbits are so annoying!

3009
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:45,620
My legs are too small!

3010
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,420
Please, let me eat you!

3011
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:53,500
Please!

3012
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:54,660
Let me eat you!

3013
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:56,600
I'm gonna get one of them.

3014
02:09:58,660 --> 02:09:59,300
Okay, nice.

3015
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:01,140
I gotta dash?

3016
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:02,500
Wait, how do I dash?

3017
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:04,100
How do I dash?

3018
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:11,520
Oh, I almost had him.

3019
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:17,420
Uh-oh.

3020
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:18,980
Is it this?

3021
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:22,420
Oh, but it like... it like makes me stop for a second.

3022
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:25,940
I got him.

3023
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:28,540
No, no, no, no, no!

3024
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,080
Eat, eat, eat!

3025
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:35,440
Alright.

3026
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,000
Did I do it?

3027
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:40,340
Did I get all of the area?

3028
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,280
Did I get all the flags?

3029
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:47,940
Can you cancel... Can you jump cancel the lunge?

3030
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:49,000
I'm not sure.

3031
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:50,640
Oh, I ran past the last one.

3032
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:50,920
That's why.

3033
02:10:56,730 --> 02:10:57,350
Here it is.

3034
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:02,330
I think I was too preoccupied with food.

3035
02:11:05,850 --> 02:11:06,250
Okay.

3036
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:06,650
Ladies!

3037
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:07,950
Ladies!

3038
02:11:09,630 --> 02:11:10,310
Ladies!

3039
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:14,170
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

3040
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:17,530
I'm not a desperate male.

3041
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:21,850
I'm just desperate for your love.

3042
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:24,510
Ladies, ladies.

3043
02:11:25,350 --> 02:11:26,550
Please be clean.

3044
02:11:26,830 --> 02:11:28,290
Please be a good lady.

3045
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:30,390
Please be a good lady.

3046
02:11:31,330 --> 02:11:32,550
Bad lady!

3047
02:11:32,670 --> 02:11:33,710
Bad lady, bad lady.

3048
02:11:33,790 --> 02:11:35,410
Desperate, sad, sad lady.

3049
02:11:35,410 --> 02:11:37,950
I could smell her desperation from here.

3050
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:40,630
Okay, we have to go all the way to the other side.

3051
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:43,990
Before we do that though, we're gonna jump up here for some...

3052
02:11:43,990 --> 02:11:45,330
a little midnight snack.

3053
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:58,220
Oh, wait!

3054
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:00,420
Maybe now she'll be better because I'm a veteran.

3055
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:02,380
Do you think?

3056
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:03,600
Or is that not how that works?

3057
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:05,980
Oh, wait.

3058
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:06,460
No, no, no.

3059
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:06,960
Sorry.

3060
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:14,400
It's because the right side says sleep, but circle is on the right side.

3061
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:14,920
You know?

3062
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:17,960
That's what gets me about it.

3063
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:18,480
Oh, shoot.

3064
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,380
Oh, shoot.

3065
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:22,500
Why?

3066
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:24,020
It should be... It should be...

3067
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:26,940
The left side says sleep.

3068
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:28,420
Well, that's... No, no, no, no.

3069
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,100
But you pressed the right button.

3070
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,520
So that's why I pressed the right button.

3071
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:36,080
Instead... Or the left... Yeah, wait.

3072
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:37,440
Huh?

3073
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:39,880
Huh?

3074
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:40,800
Huh?

3075
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:41,180
Huh?

3076
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:41,520
Huh?

3077
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:43,940
Wait, huh?

3078
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:46,260
I think it is a JP thing.

3079
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:47,560
I think it is probably that.

3080
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:49,440
I get it.

3081
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:50,400
You don't have to explain.

3082
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,160
Stop confusing me!

3083
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:01,380
Okay.

3084
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:03,700
Let's make sure this is a clean lady over here.

3085
02:13:10,600 --> 02:13:11,540
Going for the kill!

3086
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,920
Oh, she... Oh, it makes you...

3087
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,080
Okay, I'm gonna have to...

3088
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:17,380
Yeah, you can't dash and jump.

3089
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,340
That doesn't like...

3090
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:20,120
Doesn't do anything.

3091
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:21,280
It's okay, though.

3092
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:26,220
Clean lady...

3093
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:28,740
Excuse me?

3094
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:31,300
Oh, she is... Oh, she is rejecting me!

3095
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:33,900
You need to rank up to mate with that female!

3096
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,120
Are you kidding me?

3097
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,360
I was rejected.

3098
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:40,580
Why?

3099
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:46,250
Oh.

3100
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:46,970
Oh, shoot.

3101
02:13:47,590 --> 02:13:48,370
Oh, my God.

3102
02:13:49,390 --> 02:13:49,870
I'm

3103
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:54,630
not cool enough.

3104
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:56,830
I'm just a little pup, you guys.

3105
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:58,250
She wants a real dog.

3106
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:00,230
She wants a real...

3107
02:14:00,230 --> 02:14:01,750
A real ruffian.

3108
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:07,690
Clean lady!

3109
02:14:08,110 --> 02:14:08,590
Kill!

3110
02:14:12,590 --> 02:14:13,390
Bow, bow!

3111
02:14:15,350 --> 02:14:16,270
Oh, my gosh.

3112
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:19,430
How does she know how much I've killed anyway, you know?

3113
02:14:22,130 --> 02:14:23,950
This one is gonna be huge.

3114
02:14:24,430 --> 02:14:26,330
She's gonna be so impressed with this one.

3115
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:29,990
It's so much calories.

3116
02:14:31,410 --> 02:14:32,450
I'm a fat pup.

3117
02:14:33,230 --> 02:14:34,250
I'm serving bacon.

3118
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:41,430
We'll just keep going, I guess.

3119
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:45,750
We'll mark this territory.

3120
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:48,790
I want to go to the other area, but if the good dog...

3121
02:14:48,790 --> 02:14:52,270
If the better dog is over here, then it makes sense to stay over here.

3122
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:54,770
Okay.

3123
02:14:58,130 --> 02:14:58,650
Peggy!

3124
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,230
Oh.

3125
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:12,840
This game gives me Xbox 360 arcade vibes in a good way.

3126
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:15,680
It's actually quite addictive.

3127
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:16,660
I'm not gonna lie.

3128
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,380
It's actually very fun.

3129
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:21,560
Karaoke-Kan.

3130
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:23,480
Like...

3131
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:23,680
Oh.

3132
02:15:24,060 --> 02:15:25,240
Mark two times.

3133
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:25,600
Nice.

3134
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,020
Oh.

3135
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:29,220
Oh.

3136
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:30,660
Choo-choo-choo-choo.

3137
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,400
Oh.

3138
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:35,040
Take over Shibuya Station.

3139
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:36,880
Wait, didn't I not do that?

3140
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:39,760
Didn't I take over Shibuya?

3141
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:42,060
Oh my goodness.

3142
02:15:46,010 --> 02:15:47,670
Sort of like Day of the Diabler.

3143
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:49,530
Oh my god.

3144
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:58,720
Win over a mate.

3145
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,060
I'm trying!

3146
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:03,460
I'm trying!

3147
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,280
Please!

3148
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:08,180
Wait.

3149
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:09,680
There's a mate over here now.

3150
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:10,620
Let's see if she's any good.

3151
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:12,120
Oh.

3152
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:12,260
No.

3153
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:12,780
Don't touch her.

3154
02:16:12,920 --> 02:16:13,480
Stay away.

3155
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:14,440
Stay away.

3156
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:15,700
Stay away from me.

3157
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,120
Stay away from me, dirty lady.

3158
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:20,240
This pig is going crazy.

3159
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:21,440
This pig.

3160
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:22,800
Um.

3161
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:24,080
Peggy.

3162
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:25,040
Peggy, come home.

3163
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:28,520
I need to stop lunging.

3164
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:29,460
I need to start attacking.

3165
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:30,040
No!

3166
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:30,200
No!

3167
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:30,820
Stay away from me!

3168
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:35,560
Stay away from me.

3169
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:36,860
Stay away from me!

3170
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:37,380
No!

3171
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:39,020
You fiend!

3172
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:40,020
Oh my god.

3173
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:40,960
She's coming closer.

3174
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:42,040
I can see her on the radar.

3175
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:44,720
Desperate woman!

3176
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:46,540
Okay.

3177
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:50,480
Run, run, run, run, run.

3178
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,280
Run, run.

3179
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:54,600
Oh my god.

3180
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:55,400
Oh my god.

3181
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,220
Oh my god.

3182
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:57,600
Is that a cat?

3183
02:16:58,180 --> 02:16:58,580
Wait.

3184
02:16:58,600 --> 02:16:59,320
Where's another lady?

3185
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:02,440
Oh many ladies.

3186
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:06,940
Is she gone?

3187
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:07,920
Oh my god.

3188
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:08,500
Oh my god.

3189
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:08,660
Oh no, no.

3190
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:09,240
She's still here.

3191
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:12,120
Oh god, oh god.

3192
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:13,580
I have to avoid her.

3193
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:15,460
Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid.

3194
02:17:19,640 --> 02:17:21,340
That's a clip for sure.

3195
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:26,500
Okay.

3196
02:17:28,460 --> 02:17:29,900
Do you think we are good enough now?

3197
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:31,620
Do you think she'll really like us now?

3198
02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:33,860
Pet medicine.

3199
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:34,340
Nice.

3200
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:35,900
Please.

3201
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:36,920
Love me.

3202
02:17:37,460 --> 02:17:37,900
Please.

3203
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:44,080
The average, the average female.

3204
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:49,220
She's just an average female, you guys, but that's okay.

3205
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:52,800
And here we thought you were the desperate woman.

3206
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:53,300
No!

3207
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:01,180
I jump, you jump.

3208
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:03,800
That's how you know it's real love.

3209
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:05,920
Yippee!

3210
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:06,900
Yippee!

3211
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:08,520
Uh-oh, wait, I need food.

3212
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:09,680
Oh gosh, wait, hold on.

3213
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,760
Hold on, ma'am.

3214
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:17,800
May I interest you in a midnight... uh-oh.

3215
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:23,040
Nice.

3216
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:24,400
Okay, I'm better now.

3217
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:27,860
Where's the other cat?

3218
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:29,640
I think we're okay.

3219
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:30,820
I think we can just leave.

3220
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:35,980
I think we're fine.

3221
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:41,660
Oh, cannot use the nest during combat.

3222
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:45,720
Head for the... okay, here we go.

3223
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:46,540
See?

3224
02:18:46,740 --> 02:18:50,660
Okay, so mate is on the left side, but I have to press the right button.

3225
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:51,980
That's why it confused me.

3226
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:52,780
Come here, come here.

3227
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:54,880
Come here, average woman.

3228
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:56,880
Average female.

3229
02:18:58,360 --> 02:18:59,640
Dog in zaka.

3230
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:03,680
There's so many of us.

3231
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:04,640
Goodbye, parents.

3232
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:06,580
I'm just like in Pokémon.

3233
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:10,400
I'm leaving the nest at seven years old.

3234
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:14,520
Just like in Pokémon.

3235
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:15,940
Alright.

3236
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:22,000
Now, we go all the way to Shibuya.

3237
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:23,860
Somewhere else.

3238
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:28,420
Shibuya shopping.

3239
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:31,260
Come on, brothers!

3240
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,380
Les enfants terribles!

3241
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:39,040
I'm the fastest of them.

3242
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:45,410
Gang fight against the cats.

3243
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:49,510
Oh, oh, hello?

3244
02:19:49,770 --> 02:19:50,630
What's happening?

3245
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:53,850
Our dogs are supernatural.

3246
02:19:54,370 --> 02:19:56,210
They have magical powers.

3247
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:57,610
Apparently.

3248
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:06,110
The waiting thing to chat is so long, bro.

3249
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:06,770
Hi, guys.

3250
02:20:06,810 --> 02:20:07,010
Hello!

3251
02:20:07,230 --> 02:20:08,470
Thanks for subscribing.

3252
02:20:08,550 --> 02:20:12,410
Sorry, I have to do that because sometimes there's like, you know, bots.

3253
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:12,710
Sorry, I have to do that because sometimes there's like, you know, bots.

3254
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:13,550
And stuff like that.

3255
02:20:13,990 --> 02:20:15,150
What's going on here?

3256
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:16,530
Oh, I think this is a cat.

3257
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:18,910
Maybe?

3258
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:19,670
Or maybe...

3259
02:20:20,510 --> 02:20:21,010
Bunny.

3260
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:24,710
We need to eat.

3261
02:20:25,630 --> 02:20:26,130
Oh!

3262
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,490
Hello!

3263
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:37,350
I'm hungry!

3264
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:37,950
I know!

3265
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:38,570
I'm eating!

3266
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:39,590
I'm eating good!

3267
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:40,270
Holy cow!

3268
02:20:41,630 --> 02:20:42,690
I'm eating good!

3269
02:20:43,950 --> 02:20:44,450
Nice.

3270
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:45,830
Number one.

3271
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:47,970
Number two.

3272
02:20:50,170 --> 02:20:51,030
Number three.

3273
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:53,810
Nice.

3274
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:57,630
Oh, uh oh.

3275
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:58,370
Uh oh.

3276
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:05,460
This is my territory.

3277
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:07,960
This is dog territory.

3278
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:12,300
This is...

3279
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:13,940
Where did my brothers go?

3280
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:15,900
What happened to them?

3281
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:19,540
Oh, there they are.

3282
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:22,980
Doesn't notice me.

3283
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:24,580
Oh, shoot.

3284
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:25,580
Dang it.

3285
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:26,140
It's fine.

3286
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:28,080
We're fine.

3287
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:29,060
You ate them.

3288
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:30,500
They ate my brothers.

3289
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:31,260
Oh.

3290
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:31,860
Oh.

3291
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:33,140
Attack,

3292
02:21:36,910 --> 02:21:37,190
brethren!

3293
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,550
Oh, I don't like killing the kitties though.

3294
02:21:42,730 --> 02:21:43,730
It makes me so sad.

3295
02:21:45,730 --> 02:21:47,550
At least it's cats and not...

3296
02:21:47,550 --> 02:21:48,610
What was it?

3297
02:21:50,130 --> 02:21:51,950
I can't remember what it was before.

3298
02:21:52,050 --> 02:21:53,890
But there's a lot of cats here, you guys.

3299
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:55,370
There are so many cats here.

3300
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,530
Oh.

3301
02:21:58,530 --> 02:21:59,210
Oh.

3302
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:00,190
Nice.

3303
02:22:02,190 --> 02:22:03,270
No, it wasn't bee...

3304
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:04,050
The water buffalo.

3305
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:04,690
Yes, yes.

3306
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:05,510
The water buffalo.

3307
02:22:05,890 --> 02:22:07,190
Those guys were crazy.

3308
02:22:08,470 --> 02:22:09,770
They were fast.

3309
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:12,770
Oh my god.

3310
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:14,890
Oh my god.

3311
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:17,330
The cats are going crazy.

3312
02:22:17,610 --> 02:22:20,330
Oh god.

3313
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:25,110
Oh god.

3314
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:25,350
Oh god.

3315
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:27,570
Fight, dogs.

3316
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:27,850
Fight.

3317
02:22:29,710 --> 02:22:30,410
Oh my god.

3318
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:30,770
Oh my god.

3319
02:22:31,090 --> 02:22:31,770
Fight, dogs.

3320
02:22:31,850 --> 02:22:32,090
Fight.

3321
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:36,110
We can take them down.

3322
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:36,870
We can take them down.

3323
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:40,830
Oh my god.

3324
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:43,410
Yes.

3325
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:48,660
We're stronger.

3326
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:54,060
Oh my god.

3327
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:56,300
Get through gang wars for real.

3328
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:58,780
This turf is ours.

3329
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:00,280
Uh-oh.

3330
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:01,200
Our food is going bad.

3331
02:23:02,420 --> 02:23:03,720
Eat up, my brothers.

3332
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:05,740
Before it goes bad.

3333
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:07,360
Don't let the food spoil, please.

3334
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:08,980
We worked really hard on this.

3335
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,440
It's time to feast.

3336
02:23:13,780 --> 02:23:18,660
We will go from veteran to even higher.

3337
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:21,840
We're not even hungry anymore.

3338
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:22,600
We're just...

3339
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:23,580
We're just insane.

3340
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,820
I hear so many cats around.

3341
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:33,540
I want to mate here.

3342
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:35,760
I want to mate here.

3343
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:40,500
I'm going to claim this territory.

3344
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:40,780
Oh.

3345
02:23:47,150 --> 02:23:47,870
Holy cow.

3346
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:50,250
Oh my gosh.

3347
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:51,110
Oh my gosh.

3348
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:51,590
Oh my gosh.

3349
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:55,430
Oh.

3350
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:55,830
Oh.

3351
02:23:55,990 --> 02:23:56,650
Oh my god.

3352
02:23:56,650 --> 02:23:56,990
Oh my god.

3353
02:23:57,010 --> 02:23:57,210
What's wrong?

3354
02:23:57,370 --> 02:23:57,590
Ah.

3355
02:23:57,650 --> 02:23:57,970
Ah.

3356
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:01,360
There we go.

3357
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:02,060
Nice.

3358
02:24:02,380 --> 02:24:02,740
Hey.

3359
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:02,960
Hey.

3360
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:03,080
Hey.

3361
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:03,260
Hey.

3362
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:05,700
Hey.

3363
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:06,080
Hey.

3364
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:06,260
Hey.

3365
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:07,900
Hey.

3366
02:24:08,900 --> 02:24:09,200
Hey.

3367
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:10,180
These are really good cats.

3368
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:13,680
Metal.

3369
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:17,700
Poor cat.

3370
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:19,800
I'm going to go pet.

3371
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:21,980
I'm going to go love up my cats after this.

3372
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:24,900
I'm going to go love on them so much.

3373
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:28,100
More?

3374
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:29,040
Oh my god.

3375
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:29,740
Oh my god.

3376
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:30,640
It's an entire generation.

3377
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:32,180
No.

3378
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:33,360
This is our territory.

3379
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,220
This is our territory.

3380
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:48,570
You guys.

3381
02:24:48,670 --> 02:24:49,030
Oh.

3382
02:24:49,170 --> 02:24:50,490
I think my head blocked it.

3383
02:24:50,570 --> 02:24:51,730
But I'm a boss now.

3384
02:24:52,850 --> 02:24:54,790
I claimed the cat's territory.

3385
02:24:55,330 --> 02:24:56,670
And I became the boss.

3386
02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:01,410
I'm a boss.

3387
02:25:07,330 --> 02:25:08,290
Oh my god.

3388
02:25:15,770 --> 02:25:16,930
Poor big boss.

3389
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:20,530
Eat up my brothers.

3390
02:25:22,750 --> 02:25:23,550
And this is a lot.

3391
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:26,670
And then we go find lovely ladies!

3392
02:25:32,060 --> 02:25:34,260
How much higher can I get than boss?

3393
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:35,220
Can I get God?

3394
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:39,120
Dog-o-heaven.

3395
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:41,580
Dog-o-heaven.

3396
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:46,900
I bet this lady over here is really great.

3397
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:48,940
Nope, never mind.

3398
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,540
Leave me alone.

3399
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:50,340
Stay away.

3400
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:50,900
Stay away.

3401
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:58,410
We're gonna go find a great, great...

3402
02:26:02,290 --> 02:26:03,550
Just down here.

3403
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,250
Drink water.

3404
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:10,170
No fleas for us, everybody.

3405
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:14,130
No fleas for us.

3406
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:19,070
Just down here anyway.

3407
02:26:23,380 --> 02:26:24,500
Clean kill.

3408
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:31,260
Toxicity is increasing.

3409
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,580
But we need to mate.

3410
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:36,580
Do we want to mate in the toxic waste?

3411
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:40,080
Oh my gosh, what if we mate in the toxic waste?

3412
02:26:46,050 --> 02:26:48,070
That looks to be an average female.

3413
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:54,570
Okay, let's go to the nest.

3414
02:26:58,900 --> 02:26:59,300
Yeah!

3415
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:06,620
Is it still toxic?

3416
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:10,260
Drink some water, everybody.

3417
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:13,220
Make sure we're hydrated.

3418
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:15,760
Oh my god, there's just dead cat bodies everywhere.

3419
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,980
Wait, I didn't kill those, did I?

3420
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:20,640
Oh, there's more cats up here.

3421
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:23,180
Uh, sorry!

3422
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:23,720
Oh!

3423
02:27:24,900 --> 02:27:25,300
Oh!

3424
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:27,940
Oh my god, I thought I was about to die.

3425
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:30,780
Wait, did we kill him?

3426
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:31,600
Oh!

3427
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:37,740
It's R1 to avoid, isn't it?

3428
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:40,340
I thought so.

3429
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:47,760
There was a lot of fighting...

3430
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:49,920
Oh yeah, there was a lot of fighting, you're right.

3431
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:51,360
All right, let's mate!

3432
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:53,340
Good bye, boss status.

3433
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:56,220
Yeah, right stick.

3434
02:27:56,460 --> 02:27:56,800
Yeah, yeah.

3435
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:01,380
Happy birthday, Pomeranian5!

3436
02:28:08,770 --> 02:28:09,570
I've survived.

3437
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:09,630
I'm done.

3438
02:28:09,630 --> 02:28:10,650
I have 20 years.

3439
02:28:12,130 --> 02:28:12,710
No!

3440
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:16,460
That's where I was headed!

3441
02:28:18,510 --> 02:28:19,180
Aw man.

3442
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:20,620
It's okay though.

3443
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:26,160
So I guess you have a 20 year time limit.

3444
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:33,740
Our parents fought for this land.

3445
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:35,480
A.K.A.

3446
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:35,700
me.

3447
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:36,780
In another life.

3448
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:41,740
Brothers, we must not take it for granted.

3449
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:49,190
We will go to the shopping district anyway.

3450
02:28:51,230 --> 02:28:53,930
Territory of Yamanote Line East is polluted.

3451
02:28:53,970 --> 02:28:54,790
Where is that anyway?

3452
02:29:00,070 --> 02:29:02,190
Oh, Yoyogi Park has a lot of meat!

3453
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:07,410
The suburbs and the shopping district don't have that much meat.

3454
02:29:08,510 --> 02:29:10,390
I guess we'll just check it out anyway.

3455
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:17,290
Seems to be a lot going on here.

3456
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:20,050
In terms of... there's like...

3457
02:29:20,830 --> 02:29:21,870
Wait, what was the challenge?

3458
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:23,110
Sorry, I totally missed it.

3459
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:25,470
Mark six times.

3460
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:26,570
Intake 3,000 calories.

3461
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:28,630
Find Bujin.

3462
02:29:31,050 --> 02:29:31,850
Reach Dogenzaka.

3463
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:35,190
And find Bujin.

3464
02:29:36,510 --> 02:29:39,010
Wait, I have to go all the way back to Dogenzaka?

3465
02:29:39,190 --> 02:29:39,750
Are you kidding me?

3466
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:40,450
You know what, screw it.

3467
02:29:42,670 --> 02:29:43,930
Oh wait, but I need food.

3468
02:29:44,130 --> 02:29:44,690
Uh oh.

3469
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:48,130
I need food bad.

3470
02:29:50,250 --> 02:29:50,970
What is it?

3471
02:29:51,970 --> 02:29:52,770
Drink some water.

3472
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:53,490
Drink some water.

3473
02:29:53,730 --> 02:29:54,450
Drink some water!

3474
02:30:00,850 --> 02:30:02,770
Let's go find something to eat first.

3475
02:30:06,390 --> 02:30:07,430
Toxicity is increasing.

3476
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:08,210
Uh oh.

3477
02:30:11,070 --> 02:30:11,950
You are hungry!

3478
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:13,510
Uh oh!

3479
02:30:13,850 --> 02:30:14,770
Where's all the food?

3480
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:18,210
Music is kind of bumping now.

3481
02:30:18,370 --> 02:30:18,810
I know, right?

3482
02:30:19,430 --> 02:30:20,630
Oh, that's not food.

3483
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:21,250
That's a sign.

3484
02:30:25,870 --> 02:30:26,470
Uh oh.

3485
02:30:26,530 --> 02:30:27,350
I think we're in trouble.

3486
02:30:30,750 --> 02:30:32,350
Dog eat dog world.

3487
02:30:32,890 --> 02:30:33,690
Oh gosh!

3488
02:30:33,950 --> 02:30:34,530
Oh gosh!

3489
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:35,050
Oh gosh!

3490
02:30:35,070 --> 02:30:35,370
Oh gosh!

3491
02:30:35,450 --> 02:30:35,690
Oh gosh!

3492
02:30:36,990 --> 02:30:39,850
I can't tell if there's nothing here or if it's low visibility.

3493
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:41,370
Oh my god, we're gonna die.

3494
02:30:42,030 --> 02:30:43,010
We're gonna die!

3495
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:43,870
We're gonna die!

3496
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:48,790
The toxicity!

3497
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:50,670
Okay, I think we gotta get out of here.

3498
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:52,370
But there's no food.

3499
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:53,190
Oh god.

3500
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:55,070
This was a death trap.

3501
02:30:55,370 --> 02:30:57,130
Coming here was a death trap!

3502
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:02,350
I think we're in trouble.

3503
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:03,750
For real.

3504
02:31:03,970 --> 02:31:04,610
Drink water.

3505
02:31:05,370 --> 02:31:06,410
Our toxicity!

3506
02:31:07,990 --> 02:31:08,630
With

3507
02:31:20,270 --> 02:31:23,250
the taste of your lips, I'm on a run.

3508
02:31:24,350 --> 02:31:25,450
You're toxic.

3509
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:27,490
I'm very hungry.

3510
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:29,630
I'm gonna die here.

3511
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:31,830
No!

3512
02:31:32,450 --> 02:31:34,810
Oh brother, your death will not be in vain.

3513
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:38,190
We'll reach Dogenzaka, I promise.

3514
02:31:38,830 --> 02:31:39,730
I'm sorry.

3515
02:31:40,690 --> 02:31:42,130
I'm sorry, brother.

3516
02:31:42,370 --> 02:31:43,590
I'm so sorry.

3517
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:53,550
Oh, I have items.

3518
02:31:54,350 --> 02:31:55,470
Oh my gosh, wait.

3519
02:31:57,190 --> 02:31:57,730
Okay.

3520
02:31:57,830 --> 02:32:00,870
Oh, we had the bottled water the whole time.

3521
02:32:03,010 --> 02:32:03,910
No way.

3522
02:32:03,970 --> 02:32:04,790
Not us having it.

3523
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:06,990
Using the bottled water and not using it at all.

3524
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:08,470
Oopsie.

3525
02:32:09,490 --> 02:32:11,870
My parents are still up there alive and well.

3526
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:17,530
They could have more children, but they just choose to make it really difficult on us.

3527
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:22,810
It's okay.

3528
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:23,810
We still have three lives.

3529
02:32:24,850 --> 02:32:25,630
I mean...

3530
02:32:32,450 --> 02:32:34,750
How does a dog open bottled water?

3531
02:32:36,770 --> 02:32:38,270
With his teeth, obviously.

3532
02:32:38,270 --> 02:32:39,810
Oh, what?

3533
02:32:39,950 --> 02:32:40,890
It's a toxic bird.

3534
02:32:43,870 --> 02:32:47,590
That bird is too much on... That bird is literally Twitter.

3535
02:32:49,090 --> 02:32:50,470
Oh, there's something over here.

3536
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:52,470
I will eat.

3537
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:55,230
Time to munch.

3538
02:32:55,650 --> 02:32:56,970
Oh, it's a bigger dog.

3539
02:32:57,630 --> 02:32:58,430
Oh my god.

3540
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,100
Oh god, it's a big...

3541
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:05,660
Let

3542
02:33:11,920 --> 02:33:13,740
me kill him.

3543
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:14,600
Get his ass.

3544
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:16,560
Brother.

3545
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:19,920
Oh, our toxicity.

3546
02:33:21,020 --> 02:33:21,940
Brothers.

3547
02:33:26,570 --> 02:33:27,490
Brothers.

3548
02:33:29,770 --> 02:33:30,690
No.

3549
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,800
Oh my god.

3550
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:43,440
We've lost so many.

3551
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:46,380
It's just us.

3552
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:48,780
It's just us.

3553
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:53,420
Now we're the desperate one.

3554
02:33:59,420 --> 02:34:01,080
We're the desperate one.

3555
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:03,080
Oh my gosh.

3556
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:04,700
I didn't realize he took two out.

3557
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:08,740
We won, but at what cost?

3558
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:13,080
That was rough.

3559
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:14,280
That was really rough.

3560
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:16,000
Get it?

3561
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:16,640
Because it's a dog.

3562
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:18,320
That was really rough.

3563
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:22,260
Damn you, Retriever.

3564
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:28,600
Our entire bloodline was almost wiped out from one dog.

3565
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:30,940
Oh gosh.

3566
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:39,560
Cracking jokes at her brother's funeral.

3567
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:41,860
He would have wanted it this way.

3568
02:34:42,420 --> 02:34:44,240
He would have wanted it.

3569
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,640
He loved jokes at his own expense.

3570
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:56,540
So we have to find...

3571
02:34:57,420 --> 02:34:58,600
What was the guy's name?

3572
02:34:58,920 --> 02:34:59,960
I can't even remember.

3573
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,000
Is this where all the monkeys are?

3574
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:05,860
Okay, please.

3575
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:06,720
You know what?

3576
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:10,080
I might have to be the desperate dog and go for the desperate female.

3577
02:35:10,220 --> 02:35:10,920
I'm not gonna lie.

3578
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:14,080
But I don't think we have very many...

3579
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:16,100
Oh wait, that's an average.

3580
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:18,000
No!

3581
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:22,680
Come on.

3582
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:26,520
Clean kill.

3583
02:35:26,660 --> 02:35:27,280
Oh, I got a pigeon.

3584
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:31,200
Eat that pigeon.

3585
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:37,200
Once they drop.

3586
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:38,700
Wait.

3587
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,900
This is perfect.

3588
02:35:39,980 --> 02:35:40,720
We can just farm.

3589
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,200
We can just farm points.

3590
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:44,040
We can just farm points here.

3591
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:48,920
Just you wait.

3592
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:50,300
Average female.

3593
02:35:50,840 --> 02:35:52,660
I've killed enough pigeons to...

3594
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:53,320
To...

3595
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:54,460
To really...

3596
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:57,280
To really...

3597
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:58,840
Impress you.

3598
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:02,220
What if you brought a carcass to the mate?

3599
02:36:03,180 --> 02:36:04,600
What if she watches me?

3600
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:05,800
Hello?

3601
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:16,950
Let's bring it to her.

3602
02:36:18,990 --> 02:36:19,470
Hello?

3603
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:26,460
I have to rank up to be with this female.

3604
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:28,860
Where did the pigeons go?

3605
02:36:29,060 --> 02:36:29,920
Did I kill all the pigeons?

3606
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:30,760
The pigeons in Tokyo?

3607
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:32,300
Oh gosh.

3608
02:36:32,820 --> 02:36:33,340
Oh.

3609
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:34,920
Little chick.

3610
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:38,080
Sorry, little chick.

3611
02:36:38,580 --> 02:36:39,760
You are now hungry.

3612
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:40,480
Oh my god.

3613
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:41,420
The pigeons wasn't enough.

3614
02:36:42,740 --> 02:36:44,060
The pigeons weren't enough.

3615
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:45,520
I need more.

3616
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:53,590
KFP.

3617
02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:55,090
It's okay.

3618
02:36:55,450 --> 02:36:56,550
They wanted this.

3619
02:36:56,730 --> 02:36:57,350
They wanted this.

3620
02:36:57,970 --> 02:36:58,890
Is that a cat?

3621
02:36:59,150 --> 02:36:59,690
Oh my god.

3622
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:06,610
Eating.

3623
02:37:06,650 --> 02:37:06,670
Eating.

3624
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:08,890
What time?

3625
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:09,810
No.

3626
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:10,430
We are okay for now.

3627
02:37:11,790 --> 02:37:13,030
Did we rank up yet?

3628
02:37:13,110 --> 02:37:13,470
Or...

3629
02:37:14,510 --> 02:37:14,990
No.

3630
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:15,670
We are still a rookie.

3631
02:37:16,450 --> 02:37:17,570
These are rookie numbers.

3632
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:19,690
Real.

3633
02:37:24,070 --> 02:37:24,870
What is this?

3634
02:37:26,030 --> 02:37:26,510
Oh.

3635
02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:26,930
There are the monkeys.

3636
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:28,550
Come back, monkey.

3637
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:30,190
Oh my god.

3638
02:37:33,010 --> 02:37:33,490
Monkeys.

3639
02:37:33,930 --> 02:37:35,250
Stop monkeying around.

3640
02:37:36,450 --> 02:37:38,570
I've got some balloons for you.

3641
02:37:38,630 --> 02:37:38,690
Come back.

3642
02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:42,390
Come back.

3643
02:37:42,390 --> 02:37:43,910
I've got some banoos for you.

3644
02:37:47,050 --> 02:37:47,610
I've got some banoos for you.

3645
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:47,990
Where did you go?

3646
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:49,950
Come back, little monkey.

3647
02:37:51,930 --> 02:37:52,990
Run, George.

3648
02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:55,610
Why are they so fast?

3649
02:38:03,250 --> 02:38:03,810
Okay.

3650
02:38:03,890 --> 02:38:04,910
We ranked up.

3651
02:38:05,110 --> 02:38:06,370
We are a veteran now.

3652
02:38:13,170 --> 02:38:13,730
Nice.

3653
02:38:14,330 --> 02:38:14,890
Alright.

3654
02:38:14,970 --> 02:38:15,630
Let's go mate.

3655
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,130
Nice.

3656
02:38:18,130 --> 02:38:19,450
Toxicity is increasing.

3657
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:20,130
Oh gosh!

3658
02:38:21,110 --> 02:38:22,890
We're gonna mate in the rain.

3659
02:38:23,690 --> 02:38:25,250
In the toxic rain.

3660
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:27,850
Toxic rain.

3661
02:38:33,450 --> 02:38:34,230
Come here.

3662
02:38:34,570 --> 02:38:35,550
Come here, yo.

3663
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:37,830
How romantic.

3664
02:38:38,890 --> 02:38:42,310
It's like in every romance film when they make out in the rain.

3665
02:38:43,110 --> 02:38:44,490
That's literally us.

3666
02:38:45,390 --> 02:38:47,910
We're what everybody strives to be.

3667
02:38:48,490 --> 02:38:50,530
Like gosh, I want what they have.

3668
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:55,890
Missile 5 and Missile 6.

3669
02:39:00,850 --> 02:39:04,330
I think I'm... I think I'm desensitized to it now.

3670
02:39:04,890 --> 02:39:06,830
Let's go, Pomeranian 6!

3671
02:39:13,310 --> 02:39:15,790
Survived 30 years, you guys.

3672
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:17,530
This is crazy.

3673
02:39:17,610 --> 02:39:18,130
What is that?

3674
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:24,240
A fat cat!

3675
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,840
We're eating that fat cat!

3676
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:32,040
Oh my god, no way.

3677
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:36,020
Garfield real.

3678
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:43,000
It's the day after his birthday, even.

3679
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:44,600
So sad.

3680
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:49,480
The...

3681
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:51,500
What's it called?

3682
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:53,160
The thunder is like so loud.

3683
02:39:57,510 --> 02:39:58,670
There's nothing here.

3684
02:39:58,810 --> 02:39:58,930
Nothing here.

3685
02:40:00,390 --> 02:40:01,430
Nothing here...

3686
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:07,340
How am I supposed to raise my rank if...

3687
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:09,140
Oh my god!

3688
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:12,600
I didn't even see the hyena!

3689
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:13,720
Holy shit!

3690
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:15,720
Oh!

3691
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:16,060
Ouch!

3692
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:18,020
I was trying to...

3693
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:20,680
Uh oh!

3694
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:21,200
Uh oh!

3695
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:21,820
Uh oh!

3696
02:40:21,960 --> 02:40:22,360
Uh oh!

3697
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:22,800
Uh oh!

3698
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:23,540
Uh oh!

3699
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:24,520
Time to fight everybody!

3700
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:26,620
Don't eat him!

3701
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:28,020
That's my food!

3702
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:29,380
You bastards!

3703
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:37,240
Oh my god...

3704
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:39,080
That's my food!

3705
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:42,000
Oh shit!

3706
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:42,640
Oh no!

3707
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:43,640
I got taken down!

3708
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:44,320
Uh oh!

3709
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:44,840
Uh oh!

3710
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:46,140
Uh oh!

3711
02:40:46,600 --> 02:40:47,960
Uh oh!

3712
02:40:48,620 --> 02:40:49,020
Shit!

3713
02:40:49,180 --> 02:40:49,400
Shit!

3714
02:40:49,420 --> 02:40:49,780
Shit!

3715
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:50,080
Shit!

3716
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:50,140
Shit!

3717
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:50,240
Shit!

3718
02:40:50,440 --> 02:40:57,420
My blood line is gonna take it down again!

3719
02:40:59,220 --> 02:40:59,620
Nice!

3720
02:40:59,640 --> 02:40:59,840
Nice!

3721
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:01,900
Am I all that's left?

3722
02:41:02,440 --> 02:41:03,420
Am I all that's left?

3723
02:41:04,220 --> 02:41:04,820
Oh my god!

3724
02:41:04,880 --> 02:41:05,640
No, this is bad!

3725
02:41:05,720 --> 02:41:06,260
This is so bad!

3726
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:07,600
This is so bad!

3727
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:13,760
The jackals!

3728
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:22,260
I didn't even see that guy in the bushes, man.

3729
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:24,820
And then it woke up the other guy.

3730
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:32,900
But you know what?

3731
02:41:33,060 --> 02:41:34,720
We took out his family too.

3732
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:39,460
The potato clan.

3733
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:43,340
That was our highest score, I think.

3734
02:41:44,680 --> 02:41:45,640
That wasn't so bad.

3735
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:50,200
That was our highest score.

3736
02:41:50,420 --> 02:41:51,400
An eye for an eye.

3737
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:01,100
Dang, I really wanted to find whatever that other guy was.

3738
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:08,900
We're fifty... five hundred and seventy second...

3739
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:13,100
Okay.

3740
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:16,160
Okay.

3741
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:17,600
Why is it...

3742
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,980
You all have the same number of points.

3743
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:21,260
Why are you in first, huh?

3744
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:26,520
I'm five hundred and twenty-second.

3745
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:35,190
I'm one hundred and forty-fifth.

3746
02:42:35,270 --> 02:42:36,670
What is that, dog?

3747
02:42:42,850 --> 02:42:44,610
I'm second, Daily!

3748
02:42:45,850 --> 02:42:46,350
Wait.

3749
02:42:46,750 --> 02:42:48,870
I'm so close to being first, Daily.

3750
02:42:48,870 --> 02:42:51,470
I am so close to being first, Daily.

3751
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:53,170
RIP missile number six.

3752
02:42:53,270 --> 02:42:54,550
It was fun while it lasted.

3753
02:42:57,550 --> 02:42:59,030
Almost number one!

3754
02:43:03,610 --> 02:43:04,730
She's gonna go again, chat.

3755
02:43:04,830 --> 02:43:05,510
No, no, no.

3756
02:43:05,690 --> 02:43:07,110
That was it, that was it, that was it.

3757
02:43:07,210 --> 02:43:08,290
I think I'm good now, for real.

3758
02:43:10,270 --> 02:43:11,850
That was a good last run, I think.

3759
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:12,770
That was a good last run.

3760
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:14,610
Okay.

3761
02:43:15,390 --> 02:43:15,850
Dang.

3762
02:43:16,710 --> 02:43:19,350
I was trying to also find more of the, um...

3763
02:43:20,010 --> 02:43:23,270
Little things to unlock more stories, but...

3764
02:43:23,270 --> 02:43:24,790
More of the story, but...

3765
02:43:24,790 --> 02:43:28,970
My girlfriend Jess's birthday was this past Sunday and you're her favorite VTuber.

3766
02:43:29,150 --> 02:43:30,590
Can I get a happy birthday for her, please?

3767
02:43:30,770 --> 02:43:31,830
And thank you for this fun stream.

3768
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:32,630
Thank you, Kuma!

3769
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:34,030
Thank you!

3770
02:43:37,710 --> 02:43:38,170
Jess!

3771
02:43:38,170 --> 02:43:40,290
I'm sorry I missed your birthday, but...

3772
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:41,830
Happy belated birthday!

3773
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:46,710
Happy birthday to you!

3774
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:50,470
Happy birthday to you!

3775
02:43:50,690 --> 02:43:54,110
Happy birthday dear Jess!

3776
02:43:56,370 --> 02:44:01,870
Happy birthday to you!

3777
02:44:04,650 --> 02:44:05,870
Happy birthday!

3778
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:11,740
Yay!

3779
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:13,120
Yay, yay, yay.

3780
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:15,540
Alright guys, well...

3781
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:19,780
At least we got further that last round than before.

3782
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:22,720
This was so much fun.

3783
02:44:22,880 --> 02:44:24,400
I'm addicted to this game, for real.

3784
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:25,200
I want to keep playing.

3785
02:44:25,440 --> 02:44:27,920
Maybe I'll have to do a really long stream of this.

3786
02:44:28,280 --> 02:44:31,580
90% of survivors quit before making number one.

3787
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:36,430
I'm a quitter!

3788
02:44:39,010 --> 02:44:41,170
Also, you went the wrong direction for the story.

3789
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:45,990
Oh, was it only in the Shibuya area that I could get it?

3790
02:44:47,770 --> 02:44:49,110
The Shibuya shopping district?

3791
02:44:49,390 --> 02:44:50,710
But it was so toxic there.

3792
02:44:50,750 --> 02:44:52,110
I was going to die out, so...

3793
02:44:52,110 --> 02:44:53,070
That's okay, though.

3794
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:55,770
I had a lot of fun watching you today.

3795
02:44:55,870 --> 02:44:56,470
Thank you!

3796
02:44:57,130 --> 02:45:00,030
I have work tomorrow during your stream, so I hope you have a lot of fun then, too.

3797
02:45:00,410 --> 02:45:01,670
Good luck with work, Genki!

3798
02:45:02,310 --> 02:45:03,790
Thank you so much for the super time.

3799
02:45:04,250 --> 02:45:05,010
Thank you, guys!

3800
02:45:05,830 --> 02:45:07,490
So yeah, I'm going to head out now.

3801
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:09,290
Otsu minto!

3802
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:10,410
Otsu minto!

3803
02:45:11,230 --> 02:45:11,990
Otsu minto!

3804
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:13,890
Otsu...

3805
02:45:14,630 --> 02:45:15,370
Otsu Boston.

3806
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:16,550
Otsu minto.

3807
02:45:17,990 --> 02:45:23,570
Have a great rest of your night, or a great day, whatever time it is for you!

3808
02:45:25,170 --> 02:45:25,690
Itterashai!

3809
02:45:25,690 --> 02:45:26,110
Master!

3810
02:45:26,590 --> 02:45:26,990
Lady!

3811
02:45:27,690 --> 02:45:28,530
Bye bye!

3812
02:45:28,750 --> 02:45:29,810
Thank you for watching!

3813
02:45:29,930 --> 02:45:31,110
Thanks for hanging out with me!

3814
02:45:31,670 --> 02:45:32,390
Bye bye!

3815
02:45:32,430 --> 02:45:32,690
Bye bye!

3816
02:45:32,810 --> 02:45:33,110
Bye bye!

3817
02:45:33,290 --> 02:45:33,790
Bye bye!

3818
02:45:33,850 --> 02:45:34,170
Bye bye!

3819
02:45:34,270 --> 02:45:34,570
Bye bye!

3820
02:45:34,610 --> 02:45:35,230
Bye bye!
