1
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,640
Welcome back Master and Mistress!

2
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,420
Hello everybody!

3
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,340
Hello, hello, hello...

4
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,000
Hello, hello, hello... Welcome to...

5
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,240
Devil May Cry 4!

6
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,840
Oh my gosh, we already got through 3 games.

7
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
We just have 2 more.

8
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,860
2 more games!

9
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,400
Yippee!

10
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,060
I'm back!

11
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,220
Welcome back!

12
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,040
I say we have a birthday.

13
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,340
So early!

14
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,800
So early in the stream!

15
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,560
I will sing happy birthday real fast.

16
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,880
Oh, oh, sorry.

17
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,880
Happy birthday to you!

18
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,700
Happy birthday to you!

19
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,900
Happy birthday dear organizer!

20
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,280
Happy birthday to you!

21
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,620
Happy birthday!

22
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,740
Happy, happy birthday!

23
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,420
Yeah!

24
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,660
Yeah,

25
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,980
I don't know anything about Devil May Cry 4.

26
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,720
So, no spoilers!

27
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,200
Hold on, I think I'm gonna make myself a little bit smaller.

28
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,640
I'll move myself over a little bit too.

29
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
I don't know what the interface is like.

30
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,420
I don't know what the UI is like, so...

31
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,460
Welcome to Devil May Cry 4.

32
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
Minto, as always, good luck, have fun, try not to die.

33
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,320
There will be death.

34
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,840
But, apparently we've gotten over the biggest hurdle, no?

35
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,860
So, Devil May Cry 3 was like...

36
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,580
The biggie.

37
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,320
Dude, I welcome the membership.

38
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,080
Thank you!

39
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,660
Peace Walker for the road and Devil May Cry 4 at home.

40
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,440
Like high school and college video gaming all over again.

41
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,720
This one is your favorite for a long time?

42
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,240
I think, from what I've heard, most people like 5.

43
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,720
Is that true?

44
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,500
Is that true?

45
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,220
4 and 5 are the best.

46
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,800
5 is just a better version of 4.

47
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,000
5 is peak.

48
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,140
And 3.

49
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
3 and 5 are the favorites.

50
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,680
It's also my birthday.

51
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,240
Of course!

52
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,300
Happy birthday to you.

53
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,900
Happy birthday to you.

54
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,660
Happy birthday, Yuzu Chino.

55
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,960
Happy birthday to you.

56
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,180
Happy birthday.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,580
I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with wine.

58
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,500
The time has come and so have I.

59
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,920
Is that from this game or something?

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,360
Why does everyone keep saying that?

61
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,680
Oh my gosh.

62
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,740
Thank you so much for the 1500.

63
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,760
Thank you.

64
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,280
Thank you.

65
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,360
Thank you so much.

66
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:15,700
Thank you.

67
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,420
Thank you.

68
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,640
Should we just jump into it then?

69
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,040
Maybe.

70
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,840
I like how it's just legendary Dark Knight.

71
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm assuming Nero Dante is the standard.

72
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,960
Right?

73
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,940
I assume.

74
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,600
It's my birthday on Friday.

75
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,340
Oh my gosh.

76
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,380
Happy birthday.

77
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,220
I can't keep singing birthday songs.

78
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm going to dark the stream.

79
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,700
But I will sing one more.

80
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,780
Happy birthday to you.

81
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,980
Happy birthday to you.

82
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,440
Happy birthday TV's brand.

83
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,940
Happy birthday to you.

84
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,340
Happy birthday!

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,980
Every time I scroll in chat that's why it does this.

86
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,840
Okay.

87
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,160
Did you watch the opening Vergil cutscene?

88
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,120
Oh no I didn't.

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,960
I didn't.

90
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,040
I didn't.

91
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,960
DMC3.

92
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,860
Do I need to watch that before this game?

93
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,900
Oh my gosh, John.

94
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
Thank you for another.

95
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,820
Another 50.

96
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,400
Thank you.

97
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,810
No, I don't have to.

98
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,250
It's not important.

99
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,530
Let's just get started then.

100
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,110
The first one?

101
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,890
This one?

102
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,430
But look how smug he looks here.

103
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,920
This one...

104
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,080
Feels more Dante though.

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,560
Maybe.

106
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,040
Maybe.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,480
Almost a year.

108
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,240
Thank you Cooper!

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,840
Maybe.

110
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,240
But this one looks so smug.

111
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,180
This is the canon one.

112
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,620
Oh we can change later?

113
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,280
Oh okay.

114
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,440
Imagine if Minto gets slapped with an instant easy mode is now available in the first mission.

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,260
Stop!

116
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm going to be bad at the game.

117
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Imagine if the Vtuber is bad at the game.

118
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,520
The first time she's ever played it.

119
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,340
Imagine!

120
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,700
Stop it!

121
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,040
Stop it!

122
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,640
Stop it!

123
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,780
Why you no flawless?

124
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,560
I guess I'll go with this one.

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,520
Oh my gosh.

126
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,000
Wait what?

127
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,360
A mode recommended for those new to Devil May Cry series.

128
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,240
Well I mean technically I'm new but...

129
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,580
A mode for... Okay I'm guessing it's easy, normal, difficult.

130
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,660
A mode for those who have faced the demonic hordes of Devil May Cry and lived to tell the tale.

131
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm dead.

132
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,900
I haven't lived anything.

133
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,240
The overwhelming number of demons lurking in this mode demand the very best of one's abilities.

134
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,420
Even the descriptions are turning in.

135
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,800
Thank you so much for the five gifts.

136
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,740
Thank you!

137
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,040
I guess we'll do Devil Hunter.

138
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,860
Automat... What is all these settings?

139
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,440
I don't know what they mean.

140
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,940
What is automatic?

141
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,820
Don't just say off.

142
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,000
Tell me what it is.

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,820
Oh it auto combos.

144
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,780
The game does moves for you.

145
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,540
So you can have easy mode and then also easier mode.

146
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,400
You can have easy mode and then the easiest mode.

147
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,700
That's for anybody who just wants to mash the buttons and not think, right?

148
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,000
I guess I'll have the tutorial on though.

149
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,940
It's been a minute since I played.

150
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,260
Devil May Cry.

151
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,260
Game reviewer mode?

152
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,400
Probably.

153
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,980
It's so dark I can't see anything.

154
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,500
It's so bright I can't see anything.

155
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,150
Oh no, it's a little cast.

156
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,440
Keep going!

157
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,820
Zoom!

158
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,660
Oh no!

159
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,500
I thought I wasn't on Insano style.

160
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,940
Add to karaoke.

161
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,560
Thank you for the bang.

162
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,310
Yeah, punch that thing!

163
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,150
Are these like the puppet guys?

164
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,550
That like fall from the ceiling?

165
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,770
They look like them.

166
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,340
He's got the beats.

167
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,970
Oh no!

168
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,250
That was his spot, wasn't it?

169
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,210
You're missing it!

170
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,750
Keep going!

171
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,080
You can make it!

172
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,480
Is that Sparta?

173
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,480
Sparta?

174
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,900
Yes?

175
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,320
OK.

176
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,200
It's Papa.

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
Time to

178
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,840
do a dramatic turn around.

179
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,300
You gotta keep going!

180
00:14:59,560 --> 00:14:59,900
Yeah!

181
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,120
Get out of there!

182
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,850
Oh yeah.

183
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,910
Literally made it for the last note, baby.

184
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,790
She has such low standards.

185
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,690
She was like, at least you tried.

186
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,010
She literally looked at that spot halfway through the song and saw that he wasn't there.

187
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,630
There's no subtitles?

188
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,810
OK, I'll be quiet.

189
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:03,790
What?

190
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,070
There's subs in the settings?

191
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,190
OK, I'll turn them on after.

192
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,950
What?

193
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,190
He's so similar.

194
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,670
This old man sounds like he's on his last breath.

195
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,510
He's wheezing away.

196
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:49,650
OK.

197
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,300
Somebody didn't get the memo.

198
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,500
Today is Assassin's Creed cosplay day.

199
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,300
Someone didn't get the memo.

200
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,960
Nero!

201
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,340
I'm out of here.

202
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,080
But it's not over yet.

203
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
All this preaching is putting me to sleep.

204
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
My controller almost...

205
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,540
He's old!

206
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,040
Finally someone put him out of his misery.

207
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,240
Dante!

208
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,660
Evil Diaz villain arc.

209
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,580
What did the priest do to you?

210
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,820
No, not the present!

211
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,300
Forget about it.

212
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,660
It was just some sticks.

213
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,260
I didn't have time.

214
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,300
I just grabbed some dirt from outside.

215
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,740
That's how cool Dante is when I don't play as him.

216
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,120
He shot him point blank.

217
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,360
How is his face still intact?

218
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,820
Wacky wahoo hobo doesn't kiss pizza.

219
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,340
No pretty girl!

220
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,660
Dante, why are you so evil?

221
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,000
Stop it!

222
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,440
You love women!

223
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,260
Oh, dad!

224
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,760
Woah!

225
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,180
He loves pizza.

226
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,780
Dante looks like that meme of people with blue eyes just staring into your soul.

227
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,640
Is this a tutorial fighting Dante?

228
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,320
Oh, ok.

229
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,550
That'd be crazy.

230
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,490
Why hasn't Dante said anything?

231
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,230
I can't...I don't believe this is him.

232
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,080
He usually...where's his funny one liners?

233
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,260
Oh no.

234
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,420
Oh, nevermind.

235
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,520
What's happening?

236
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,440
Oh, there it is.

237
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,200
Oh no!

238
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,100
Face off against the...Oh no!

239
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,920
The first mission really is fighting Dante!

240
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,180
Oh no!

241
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
Oh, this is all so familiar, huh?

242
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,700
I wanna see...Wait, hold on.

243
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,040
Sorry, I'm just looking at stuff.

244
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,100
Ok, Dante.

245
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:17,820
Damn!

246
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,180
Damn!

247
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,780
No, no.

248
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,880
Ok, I guess, yeah.

249
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,580
Sorry, spoilers, maybe.

250
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,280
Sorry, sorry.

251
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,320
How do I get out?

252
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,360
Wait, options, here we go.

253
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,560
Subtitles.

254
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,640
On.

255
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,540
Ok, I fixed it.

256
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,980
Can I turn up the brightness just a little bit?

257
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,030
Oh, it's so bright.

258
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,950
What if I played the game like this?

259
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,730
Maybe it's because I have my window open.

260
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,790
I can't see anything.

261
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,790
Ok.

262
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,770
Plus ten should be fine.

263
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,350
Ok.

264
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,030
Exit.

265
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,150
Ok.

266
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,450
Can I...

267
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,410
There we go.

268
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,570
Select costume.

269
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,990
Oh, you really can change.

270
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,290
Oh wait, it's kind of...Is it similar?

271
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:22,990
Where like...

272
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,730
You can't really change.

273
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,450
You'd have to do all the missions over again.

274
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,850
But in the new costume.

275
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,160
Oh my god.

276
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,480
I just restart the entire thing, you guys.

277
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,100
I'm so sorry.

278
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,700
Ok, we're fine now.

279
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,160
Ok, mission start.

280
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,860
Ok.

281
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,320
Alright.

282
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Telling us how to move.

283
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,940
We love that.

284
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,960
Gun attack.

285
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,000
Ok, I remember that.

286
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,140
You can also fire a gun while in the air.

287
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,880
Yeah, I know that.

288
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,160
Oh yeah,

289
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,310
DMC2.

290
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,830
Oh, it won't let me...

291
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,230
I am attacking!

292
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,650
Can I do the next thing, please?

293
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:18,930
Oh, I have to attack him like...

294
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,290
I have to attack him a certain number of times.

295
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,550
Ok.

296
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,710
Four.

297
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,390
I have to like, stun lock him that many times.

298
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,590
Ok.

299
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,030
Oh my god, some rorbs!

300
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,390
Ok, I know how to jump.

301
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,770
It won't...It physically will not let me use my sword or anything.

302
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,790
I have to jump to avoid gunfire.

303
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,250
Ok.

304
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,230
So shoot.

305
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,030
Oh.

306
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,770
Oh my god, the rorb looks so scary.

307
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,070
Ok.

308
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,350
Can you shoot again?

309
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,170
So I can get through this tutorial.

310
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,690
Ok, two.

311
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,550
Alright.

312
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,470
He is just standing there.

313
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,610
And jumping.

314
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,130
Ok.

315
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,330
Now what can I do?

316
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,800
Ok, while on the ground...

317
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,980
Press RB sideways.

318
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,540
On LS plus...Ok, side roll.

319
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,800
Oh gosh, ok.

320
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,880
More rorbs please!

321
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:35,900
Ouch!

322
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,440
Hold on!

323
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,480
More rorbs.

324
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,800
Why is he doing that?

325
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,660
Ouch!

326
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:46,920
Ouch!

327
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,240
Ouch!

328
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,620
Hold on!

329
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,980
Why is he...Give me the money please.

330
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,520
Thank you.

331
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,680
Are you not entertained?

332
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,640
He is insane.

333
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,700
You shouldn't have done your fancy theatrics.

334
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,880
You lost sight of him.

335
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,180
We got the subtitles.

336
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,520
He is like, oh yeah.

337
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,620
What is this silent treatment?

338
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,340
I don't like it.

339
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,980
Do...Press Y a bunch of times.

340
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Y, Y, Y, Y.

341
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,440
I turned off auto.

342
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,820
That was the first thing I did.

343
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,830
Y, Y, Y, Y, Y.

344
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,870
Alright, I can press the button.

345
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,770
High roller.

346
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,210
While on the ground, press RB back.

347
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,550
Ok, I recognize this.

348
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,010
Come here.

349
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,510
The camera is so nice actually.

350
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,970
Why is it...Wait, I'm so confused.

351
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,390
Every time I press back, it turns me around.

352
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,630
Oh, I have to hold RB.

353
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,070
I'm stupid.

354
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,190
Oh my god.

355
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,580
The lock on.

356
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,300
Oh, that's the lock on.

357
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,080
It looks so funny.

358
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,680
Oh, it didn't hit him.

359
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,040
Stop dodging.

360
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,260
Stop dodging, please.

361
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,300
Please stop dodging me.

362
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,740
Stop dodging me.

363
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,100
Stop dodging me.

364
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,940
There we go.

365
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,860
High roller.

366
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,020
Is that not what I just did?

367
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,300
Angel, thank you so much for the gifted.

368
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,720
I'm gonna start destroying stuff so I can get more roar.

369
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,470
Who needs seats?

370
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,630
His arm!

371
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,050
Just taunting you.

372
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,390
You got a trick up your sleeve.

373
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,290
He speaks!

374
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,570
Are you my papa?

375
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,610
What is happening?

376
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:00,850
What is happening?

377
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,400
I still have not learned how to balance the music and the speaking.

378
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,760
Buster.

379
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,380
I already know her.

380
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,100
Press B near an enemy.

381
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,900
You can grab an enemy with the devil bringer and toss them like a cheap toy.

382
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,620
Audio mixing is still terrible, yeah.

383
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,740
Oh my god!

384
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,720
Come here, Dante.

385
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,990
Come here.

386
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,150
He's stuck.

387
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,010
Come here.

388
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,150
Catch this!

389
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,230
Slamma!

390
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,190
Is the game kind now?

391
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,930
It's the tutorial, but I don't have a health bar.

392
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,570
That's insane.

393
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,630
So, you're looking to play, huh?

394
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,470
Alright, I guess I got some time to kill.

395
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,150
He's so calm, cool, collected.

396
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,050
Tough guy, huh?

397
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,730
Oh, I thought that was a monkey.

398
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,910
I'll just turn it up I suppose.

399
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,430
Sorry if the music is loud.

400
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:36,510
Oh my god.

401
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,850
They're just two peas in a pod.

402
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,890
Oh, there it is.

403
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,250
I spoke too soon, huh?

404
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,490
Wait.

405
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,950
I wanna keep doing this.

406
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,560
Damn, he's so good at dodging, unlike me.

407
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,420
Wait, hold on.

408
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,700
I gotta get my robes, please.

409
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,040
Did he dodge my...

410
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,820
It's really important.

411
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,400
How do I taunt?

412
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,620
How do I taunt?

413
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,360
Select.

414
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,780
He's got stinger!

415
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,460
No, that's my move!

416
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,860
Please!

417
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,480
Please, that's my move!

418
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,880
No!

419
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,570
Ouch!

420
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,110
Wait, that's how I dodge.

421
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,470
Okay.

422
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:18,890
Come on, grab him!

423
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,830
What is the... Why is the thing going down?

424
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,850
I wish I could not get stuck in a loop.

425
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:44,350
Sorry.

426
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,870
I'm getting used to it, guys.

427
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,150
Wait a minute.

428
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,950
Why is it... Is it his health or like... What is it?

429
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:54,730
Oh, come here!

430
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,300
Stop getting me!

431
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,820
This is health.

432
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,240
Oh.

433
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,040
Is health two?

434
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,780
Interesting.

435
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,780
That's not...

436
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,400
That was way too slow to be...

437
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,960
Almost making him DT.

438
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,700
Wow, how poetic.

439
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,920
Blue?

440
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,460
I think that's kind of...

441
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,240
His clothes remain intact.

442
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,980
That's insane.

443
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,140
Oh my god!

444
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,900
They were demons the whole time.

445
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
Adios!

446
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,400
It wasn't me!

447
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,880
It wasn't me!

448
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,840
Adios, kid.

449
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,380
I'm a tough hunter.

450
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,660
Oh, I found all the rorbs.

451
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,600
Gives me an S, baby.

452
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,200
Proud souls must be expended to obtain new skills.

453
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,040
They can be returned should you decide to unlearn these skills.

454
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,960
Skills can be obtained on the mission start screen as well as the divinity statues found during missions.

455
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,080
I see.

456
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,240
When you're sick, sexy, stylish, your clothes cannot be damaged.

457
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,300
Dang.

458
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,970
When will they introduce, you know...

459
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,220
A clothing damage mechanic.

460
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,320
I thought that's what made this game so great.

461
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,980
Help a lady.

462
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,160
Excited.

463
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,850
She yearns for your touch.

464
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,270
Oh, that was the gift.

465
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,260
Wow, it's so beautiful.

466
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,380
Oh,

467
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,720
sorry.

468
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,920
I do not jest.

469
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,500
Are you a demon too?

470
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,440
You still haven't recovered.

471
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,120
There's no time in duty calls.

472
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,920
Wow, that looks so beautiful on you.

473
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,780
Say something.

474
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,060
I can't pass on an emergency.

475
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,220
I must return to headquarters and report.

476
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,420
I think she was waiting for your compliment.

477
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,800
Duty calls.

478
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,080
Oh.

479
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,270
Oh no, Assassin's Creed.

480
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,370
Oh no!

481
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,660
Where did all these people come from?

482
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
It was just so quiet.

483
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,980
Oh yeah.

484
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,040
Get out of here!

485
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,280
I'm never careful.

486
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,820
Kyrie!

487
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,040
Oh no!

488
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,220
It's crying child.

489
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,480
Oh, is she going to die?

490
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,340
Oh no.

491
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:50,800
Oh no.

492
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,990
He called my name.

493
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,870
Thanks Nero!

494
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,950
I think she's going to die later.

495
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,170
She is.

496
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,780
When do I get to fight him?

497
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,620
Right now.

498
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,980
As it blocks the exit.

499
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,880
Or soon.

500
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,450
I'm doing all of this by the way.

501
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,170
It's not a cutscene.

502
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,810
Oh my god!

503
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,190
Oh my

504
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,800
god!

505
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,250
Mission 2.

506
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,670
How many missions are in this game?

507
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,710
How many...

508
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,670
Wow, I want to see the statue.

509
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,730
Use proud souls to learn... Wait, proud souls?

510
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,670
It's not robes anymore?

511
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,870
I mean it did say earlier use the proud souls.

512
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,310
Oh I have 165!

513
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,050
Red Queen.

514
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,290
That's my sword.

515
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,610
Oh my gosh.

516
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,930
I have like no money.

517
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,890
I could shuffle.

518
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,130
There's so many.

519
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,530
Streak?

520
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,000
Is that...

521
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,920
Is that stinger equivalent?

522
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,320
It's so cheap because I know everybody wants it.

523
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,900
What's the combos?

524
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,200
While on the ground press Y.

525
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,120
Then Y.

526
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,040
Tap Y.

527
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,480
What?

528
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,720
So, slow Y.

529
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,060
I'll buy it.

530
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,460
I like that...

531
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,980
Obtain skill, yes.

532
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,400
I like that if you don't want something...

533
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,240
Or rather if you want the money back you can just unlearn the skill.

534
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,040
That's pretty nice.

535
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,120
Blue rose, I'm guessing that's my gun.

536
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,020
Nope, that's my gun.

537
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah.

538
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,280
Or my arm?

539
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,320
Wait, is it my gun or my arm?

540
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,560
It's my gun.

541
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,460
Just for warrior skills.

542
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:58,940
Exactly.

543
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,680
Table hopper.

544
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,800
I don't have like any more money.

545
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,080
I'm just kind of seeing what else we got.

546
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,460
These are so expensive.

547
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,660
Get more orbs!

548
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,140
Buy speed.

549
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,520
Yeah, with what money, Jack?

550
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:35,850
Morbs!

551
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,550
An air hike, how classic.

552
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,390
Enemy step.

553
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,690
In mid-air press A to...

554
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,850
You can just jump on the enemy!

555
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,410
That's so good.

556
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,530
Morbs.

557
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,970
I'm morbing.

558
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,210
Auto skill up.

559
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,600
I don't trust you.

560
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,740
Cancel all.

561
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,720
Cancel all acquired skills and refund.

562
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,000
Oh my goodness, no.

563
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,460
Let's see what items we got.

564
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,700
Okay, vital star.

565
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,860
Holy water is so expensive.

566
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,700
Oh my god.

567
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,860
Blorb.

568
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,040
Classic.

569
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,320
Wait a second, they don't have different faces this time?

570
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,520
That's so sad.

571
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,680
That's so sad.

572
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,040
They all look the same.

573
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:51,370
Wait, Nero's gun is pretty good but you might want to adjust the controls a bit since you have to hold the button to charge it.

574
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,330
I see, I see.

575
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,550
I'll try it out, we'll see.

576
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,310
Head for Fortuna Castle.

577
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,700
Nice.

578
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,600
Map.

579
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,160
Your entry point.

580
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,960
Other doors.

581
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,640
Your current position is shown in the minimap.

582
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,000
Pause menu.

583
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,440
Lock on.

584
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,460
Oh, look at that!

585
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,500
Oh my gosh, it shows how much I have left.

586
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,760
That's so nice actually.

587
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,110
That's so nice actually.

588
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,150
Wait, it's so easy to tell.

589
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,550
Oh my god, there's so many rorbs!

590
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,490
Oh, investigate.

591
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,590
Press B or A to examine suspicious looking areas.

592
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,630
That's the door.

593
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,150
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,510
Hold on.

595
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,190
I'm looking around.

596
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,390
My girlfriend's over there!

597
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:02,090
And if I destroy these... Sorry, depth of perception.

598
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,030
I get more money.

599
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,110
So that's where I started.

600
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,790
Interesting.

601
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,430
So it shows you where you start?

602
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,170
Why though?

603
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,240
Break.

604
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,060
Do these break?

605
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,220
Everything breaks.

606
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,940
Okay, not everything breaks.

607
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,440
The trash cans!

608
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,340
Someone hid money in the trash can.

609
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,160
Oh yeah, baby!

610
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,540
And then I can sit.

611
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,660
Oh my gosh!

612
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,960
Look at the...

613
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,020
Look at the...

614
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,120
It's like steampunk.

615
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,540
Do these...

616
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,060
We can't destroy the flowers.

617
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,720
Alright, let's go through the door.

618
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,320
Hold on.

619
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,280
What'd you say?

620
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,400
Okay, I learned how to taunt.

621
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:13,700
It's weird because before I was playing on my Switch.

622
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,480
And now I'm playing PC so it's all different.

623
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:19,820
L2?

624
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,300
What's that?

625
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,040
I'll try it.

626
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,160
Kick jump.

627
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,180
After jumping press A near a wall.

628
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,580
Okay, double jump.

629
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,440
Woah!

630
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,320
Okay,

631
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,900
that's what that does.

632
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,820
Oh my gosh, I can change the camera angle.

633
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,470
Nice.

634
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,770
Gorb!

635
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,990
Magic golden stone.

636
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,940
Gorb.

637
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,140
Okay, sometimes I can adjust the camera angle.

638
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,760
Money, money, money.

639
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,730
Oh, these are definitely guys.

640
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,380
Max the rev bar and do a stinger?

641
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,600
Okay, I'll try it.

642
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,520
Ryan, thank you so much for the dead gift!

643
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,280
Thank you!

644
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,400
Get your name and welcome to bamboo ship!

645
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,120
Thank you!

646
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,200
Thank you!

647
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,900
They look so awesome though.

648
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,700
I love the design of them.

649
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,520
Oh wow, they look so funky!

650
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,440
Did the door attack me now?

651
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,760
Doors don't attack me anymore.

652
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:15,860
What?

653
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,020
The time has come!

654
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,000
So am I!

655
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,400
Do they know what that means or...

656
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,400
Is it supposed to mean that or...

657
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,540
Is it...

658
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,290
Do they know?

659
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,170
Happy Sunday!

660
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,190
Happy Sunday!

661
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,850
Oh my gosh, also... Sorry, I'm kind of blocking the map.

662
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,370
Should I like maybe...

663
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,530
Scoot like right here?

664
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:12,170
It's actually so nice though, because you'll always know where you started and then where you need to go next.

665
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,170
Because yeah, you see the start point down there.

666
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,370
So you don't get lost as much.

667
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,110
Oh my gosh.

668
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,040
Oh my gosh.

669
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,760
Rebellion!

670
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,080
The time has come and so have I.

671
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,700
It's a business district.

672
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,280
These guys mean business.

673
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,240
Party people!

674
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,620
That's where I came from.

675
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,820
Just kidding.

676
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,420
Wait.

677
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,840
Actually, you know what?

678
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,780
The map is confusing.

679
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,760
This is where I came from.

680
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,620
Minto no longer has an excuse when she gets lost.

681
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,600
It's my fault.

682
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,120
It's my fault.

683
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,880
I literally just said, oh wow, it's so easy.

684
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,080
And here I am, not knowing anything.

685
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,420
6,000 rorbs!

686
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,200
Exactly.

687
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,080
We got

688
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,470
lots of choices around here.

689
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,690
I want that.

690
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,850
Give me that!

691
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,120
Maybe we jump across or something.

692
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:42,640
Is this the prison?

693
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,280
Oh my gosh, thank you.

694
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,560
By the way, you can adjust that.

695
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,040
What's this?

696
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,760
It's a candle.

697
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:06,860
Oh!

698
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,300
Chuni!

699
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,500
Oh my gosh, sorry, I almost missed it.

700
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,520
Is it two?

701
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,960
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

702
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

703
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,840
Please!

704
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,860
Holding lock on changes an arm attack.

705
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,140
Wait.

706
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,240
What do you mean?

707
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,290
Oh yeah, see, there is a second story.

708
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,530
Hold on.

709
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,250
Maybe I just can't get to it yet.

710
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,250
Chuni, look at the membership!

711
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,330
What the heck?

712
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,270
What the heck?

713
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,410
What the heck is happening?

714
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,790
Not yet.

715
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,590
Oh, I don't think...

716
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,050
Okay, so I don't have it unlocked yet.

717
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,770
Can I jump from like this wall?

718
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,670
Oh no.

719
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,290
Is there a...

720
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,290
There is no hole in the wall.

721
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:06,790
Spider!

722
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,310
Okay, I guess...

723
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,190
I'll stop.

724
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,610
I'll stop messing around.

725
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,150
I'll stop.

726
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,170
Look at...

727
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,430
But there is a star!

728
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,990
Just crawl through, Nero!

729
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,470
It's so weird saying Nero.

730
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,790
It's so weird.

731
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,250
What's this?

732
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,650
Oh, no way.

733
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:32,490
Is this an elevator?

734
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,540
You'll get used to it.

735
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,780
It's so weird.

736
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,780
I'm so used to saying Dante.

737
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,000
At least with like Metal Gear, I can always say snake and it's right.

738
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,140
Well, except in 2.

739
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,200
Well, technically it's kind of right.

740
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,640
Actually, he originally was a snake.

741
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,560
And then they changed his codename to Raiden.

742
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,160
Victor, welcome to membership.

743
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:08,920
Thank you so much.

744
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,420
I think I just got the thing you were telling me to do.

745
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,080
Evil legacy!

746
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,520
Unleash the tentacles.

747
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,560
Is there like crazy fanart of this or what?

748
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,340
Has the ability to awaken a new power within.

749
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,920
Yeah, it does.

750
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,600
Someone saw that and something was awakened within them too.

751
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,480
Hellbound.

752
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,860
Lock on to Gr... Grim... Grip.

753
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,200
Sorry, I can't say that well.

754
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,280
Lock on...

755
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:46,580
Sorry.

756
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:58,000
Oh my god.

757
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,700
This is like triggering my stutter.

758
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,280
Oh my gosh.

759
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,520
Sorry.

760
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:01,940
Hold on.

761
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,040
I have a bit of a stutter sometimes.

762
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,060
And if I... If it like gets activated, I can't...

763
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,440
It gets worse, you know.

764
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

765
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,800
Grippy.

766
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,280
I'm just gonna say the grippy.

767
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,660
Grippy.

768
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,340
While standing on a continuum pad.

769
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,720
And press B.

770
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,340
Sorry.

771
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,640
That was embarrassing.

772
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,460
Lock on.

773
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,160
Grippy.

774
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,280
Fun!

775
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:38,460
Okay.

776
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,300
Hit the grippy.

777
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,100
Nero's VA voice is Dante.

778
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,080
I didn't know that at all.

779
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,080
I don't know some... I've been trying to avoid like spoilers of stuff, you know.

780
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,240
Not to say that that's a spoiler, but...

781
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,800
I don't even know who Nero, this guy is.

782
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,360
This is all new to me.

783
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,920
Don't say lock on to a... Don't say that.

784
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,720
Don't say that.

785
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,940
Don't say that.

786
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,760
I'm... Dang it.

787
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:22,560
Nero.

788
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:23,780
Why?

789
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,770
Nero, why?

790
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,230
Can I get baited?

791
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,770
Why is this jump suck so much?

792
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,210
Use the grippy.

793
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,110
You can't there, no?

794
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,890
You can only use it on the... on the launch pads?

795
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,590
It's right there within my grasp.

796
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,590
Wait, how do I get the things below me?

797
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,210
And like the cells and stuff.

798
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:52,430
You can use it wherever?

799
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:53,530
You can?

800
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,470
What?

801
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,390
Wait a second.

802
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,510
Then...

803
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,970
My god!

804
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,850
Is there anything else in here?

805
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,050
Oh!

806
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,530
Thank you for explaining.

807
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,990
Backseaters are like so proud of themselves right now.

808
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,090
They're like, yeah, we told her the thing and it worked.

809
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,010
We did it!

810
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,650
She listened to our instructions and it succeeded.

811
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,250
Crazy.

812
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,970
Oh, is that a wall?

813
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,170
Okay, I guess that's a wall.

814
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,370
Secret... Oh, come on.

815
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,230
Don't explain the secret mission.

816
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:20,510
Examining certain areas within a stage can reveal the existence of secret missions.

817
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:24,950
Remember, suspicion is the precipice of enlightenment.

818
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,190
VTuber listened!

819
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,490
I guess we'll check it out.

820
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,210
Finally, the time has come and so have I.

821
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,750
Destroy all demons within the time limit.

822
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:41,970
Okay, I'll try.

823
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,810
I'm not really good at these though.

824
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:53,810
Dang, he's tough.

825
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,490
I'm just gonna keep stingering him.

826
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,050
There we go.

827
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,100
Oh no!

828
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,990
That thing seems pretty...

829
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,260
pretty strong.

830
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,310
Oh,

831
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,080
I have to remember to like...

832
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,550
Oh, grab him.

833
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,290
Oh, no.

834
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:36,990
Grab

835
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,200
him.

836
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:42,860
Grab him.

837
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,860
Okay, and then grab him.

838
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,780
And then grab him.

839
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:05,190
I see.

840
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,350
You're streaking him.

841
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:16,430
Oh yeah, Nero's a streaker, not a stinger.

842
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,870
That was the last one.

843
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,510
Should we try again?

844
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,570
Let's try one more time.

845
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,970
I'm learning with the arm too.

846
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,070
You can grab him and then you can throw him.

847
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,830
You grab him, you lock on, you grab him and then you unlock and you throw him.

848
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,470
And it's powerful, it seems.

849
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,770
More so than streaking on him.

850
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:55,910
Hey,

851
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,700
I did it!

852
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,260
Blow up fragment!

853
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,760
VTuber, those combos are not optimal.

854
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,980
My bad.

855
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,080
VTuber...

856
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,360
The time has come and so has...

857
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,300
I can't believe those are the actual lyrics.

858
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,160
I can't believe it.

859
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,420
But I can also believe it.

860
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,440
Devil may cry.

861
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,080
Oh no!

862
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,340
Who am I fighting here?

863
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,880
I don't know how to feel about the webbies.

864
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,830
I don't know why I was doing that.

865
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,990
Slam dunk!

866
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,890
Not even SSS, VTuber.

867
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,470
I know, gosh.

868
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:23,410
The worst to ever do it.

869
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,650
How can she ever think about even playing a video game?

870
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,190
I can't believe she even attempts.

871
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,910
Snatch!

872
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,250
I'm so ahead of this game.

873
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,550
I'm just so...

874
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:47,170
Come here.

875
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,110
I can't believe those are the lyrics.

876
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:10,430
No, no, no, no, no, no!

877
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,850
Devil may come.

878
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,410
Oh my gosh, Jack, thank you so much for the pink.

879
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,110
Mint, that's me!

880
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:21,450
How'd you know?

881
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,610
How'd you know that's my name?

882
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,910
Looking forward to the karaoke of Nero's theme.

883
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,910
Nero is kind of freaky.

884
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,220
One thing I'm not good at doing is like that.

885
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,260
The little dodges, you know.

886
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,540
Because, okay, my...

887
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,040
It's like camera specific.

888
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:53,830
Are they still down there?

889
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,910
I'm trying to see.

890
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,550
There's no one there.

891
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:02,030
I hear laughter.

892
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:08,160
No one's down there.

893
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,640
Oh, bar.

894
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,080
Okay.

895
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,800
The party moved on.

896
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,320
Where do all the hip kids hang out now?

897
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,500
I'm in the residential district.

898
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,800
Very cool.

899
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,540
Oh.

900
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:31,560
Red Queen's fuel injection system igniting a special propellant along the blade that propels the next attack to new heights of power.

901
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,080
Three maximum levels of power.

902
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:43,690
Did I mess it up?

903
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:44,750
I think I did.

904
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,270
Wait, I think I messed it up.

905
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,320
Oh, hello.

906
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,110
No, you... Wait, how do I change...

907
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:17,430
Uh-oh.

908
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:19,190
There it is.

909
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,510
I don't know how to change targets yet.

910
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:26,570
Click

911
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:31,570
in the left stick?

912
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,090
I just tried that, but it didn't work.

913
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:33,650
I'll try it again.

914
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,600
Click the stick?

915
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,580
Right stick?

916
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,980
Okay, I'll try right stick instead.

917
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,680
Try it next time.

918
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,520
Little tiny room.

919
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,820
Follow... It's like a candy rorb.

920
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,680
Candy line of rorbs.

921
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,880
Which way do I go?

922
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,300
Follow the rorbs.

923
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:03,760
I'm greedy.

924
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:05,620
I'm greedy!

925
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,920
It pays to be greedy, baby.

926
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,780
Follow the candy.

927
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,360
Candy!

928
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,590
Yo, I have so much money.

929
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,110
I might be good at this game or something.

930
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,070
Thank you for the pink!

931
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,790
Wait, what was that about Kyria?

932
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,990
This is just like one of my Japanese anime.

933
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:47,430
Otnim.

934
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:51,370
Thank you so much for the pink, Dr. Cranberry.

935
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,350
Time is coming, so am I.

936
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:05,090
I'm gonna get like the worst grade on this mission.

937
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,290
Because I'm taking my time.

938
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,870
Sorry, I don't always take my time on things, you know me.

939
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,730
If you've never watched me before, this is just how I play.

940
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,390
I like to run around and be a little silly.

941
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,650
I'm no speed runner.

942
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,970
I'm a slow runner.

943
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:27,270
The man in the red coat headed off towards the coast.

944
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,430
To get there, you're going to have to lower the drawbridge.

945
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,320
Slow walk.

946
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,380
You're my favorite DMC Vtuber.

947
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:47,740
I know there's a few people that I've played, but...

948
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:49,840
I think...

949
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:52,860
Roar.

950
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,000
I appreciate it.

951
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:57,780
Thank you.

952
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,000
I'm glad you think that my enthusiasm is fine.

953
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:04,340
You!

954
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,620
You!

955
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,960
I'm too good.

956
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,920
Look at the membership.

957
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,640
Keto, thank you for that gifted wire.

958
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,260
There's so many gifted memberships today.

959
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,000
Thank you so much.

960
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,020
Thank you, thank you.

961
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,680
Oh, there is a membership stream right after this stream.

962
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,480
Oh my gosh.

963
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,560
You guys are going to have to remember... Wait.

964
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,920
It's only been like an hour.

965
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:31,540
Okay, good.

966
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,420
Wait, what time is my membership stream at today?

967
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,200
5?

968
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,440
In 4... Not 4 hours.

969
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,000
In 3 hours.

970
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:42,320
Okay.

971
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,000
I might get into this, you know, and then forget.

972
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:53,400
Just maybe towards the time of this next stream, remind me.

973
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,420
The time has not come, so I haven't either.

974
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,240
That's the new song.

975
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,420
Pyrobug, thank you for the funny outfit!

976
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:13,870
Teacup, thank you for the...

977
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:18,190
You can throw down bosses?

978
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:19,890
Oh, hell yeah!

979
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,250
I don't care about stylish rank!

980
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,950
Oh, I thought that said daddy.

981
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,930
Like, ready, but with a D.

982
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,410
I was about to be like, I don't think that's a word.

983
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,420
Are you daddy?

984
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,060
Puzzle time!

985
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:50,440
Oh my gosh, I love puzzles.

986
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,920
One thing I thought about playing recently is Catherine.

987
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,340
Because I've heard it's just puzzles.

988
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,860
And I'm kind of interested.

989
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,560
K-Saber, thank you for the 5 gift cards!

990
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,340
That was the puzzle?

991
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,780
Oh, okay.

992
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:20,180
I saw that it was on the Steam sale, so...

993
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,960
I've never played it before though.

994
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,900
But it's timed puzzles.

995
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,380
I see.

996
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:28,420
Interesting.

997
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,200
Oh, just kidding.

998
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,860
The time has come and I still need a few more minutes.

999
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,580
I'm kind of sleepy.

1000
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,680
This doesn't always happen.

1001
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:53,530
Dang it!

1002
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:57,770
Gosh, he's just like Dante.

1003
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:03,110
I love it!

1004
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:06,370
It's just like a spitting image of him.

1005
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,440
A drawbridge.

1006
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,780
Gun fixes everything.

1007
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,180
Exactly.

1008
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,280
Can I just jump down from here?

1009
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:20,520
No?

1010
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,000
Okay.

1011
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,580
Lollipop, chainsaw, no more heroes are all great games.

1012
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,380
Oh yeah!

1013
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:31,500
Lollipop, chainsaw I've actually played a little bit of before, but I never finished it.

1014
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,760
Stylish rank matters more in this game since you buy skills with Proud Souls now instead of rewards.

1015
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,900
Don't say that!

1016
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:41,800
Oh no!

1017
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,280
Wait, I'm lost.

1018
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,340
There's the door.

1019
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,540
Oh, wait.

1020
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm trying to... I can't get the camera... There it is.

1021
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,980
What the hell is it locking on to?

1022
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,180
Oh, there it is.

1023
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:12,260
Wait.

1024
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,020
Grab!

1025
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:13,700
Grabby grab!

1026
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:14,500
Grabby grab him!

1027
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:15,040
Hello?

1028
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:16,280
There we go.

1029
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,160
That was weird.

1030
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,730
I keep only getting C's.

1031
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:30,770
They get degrees though.

1032
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:37,530
C's get... Proud... Proud... Solis.

1033
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:37,630
Solis.

1034
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,350
Oh, my arm was too short.

1035
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,450
Taunting helps.

1036
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:46,370
That's right!

1037
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:48,610
Thank you for the reminder.

1038
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,120
Your timing is impeccable.

1039
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:02,740
Fix up your moves?

1040
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,200
I try!

1041
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,220
I only have a few skills though.

1042
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,680
I have Y, Y, Y, Y.

1043
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,600
I have backwards Y.

1044
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,360
I have... I don't have Y, pause, Y, pause, Y.

1045
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,540
My guns too.

1046
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,440
Will that increase it?

1047
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,240
It's OK.

1048
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:40,450
Taunt!

1049
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,250
Why am I pulling them all towards me?

1050
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,250
Ouchie, ouchie.

1051
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,930
I still only get C's.

1052
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,770
I got B's at one point, but...

1053
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,490
Chat is now back to the tutorial.

1054
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,350
No, it's OK.

1055
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:30,130
I like reminders.

1056
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,360
OK, but you don't have to be mean, OK guys?

1057
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,180
I'm still...

1058
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,580
Taunting in the air.

1059
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,240
You don't have to be mean though.

1060
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,020
It's new.

1061
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,160
There's new controls.

1062
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,480
OK, I'll get used to it eventually.

1063
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,110
Doesn't seem very safe.

1064
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,010
What is that?

1065
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:15,370
Well, I went down here.

1066
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,470
Even though it didn't seem very safe.

1067
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,870
Air taunts are only DMC5.

1068
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,130
You guys can't taunt.

1069
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,110
Yeah, you can't.

1070
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:25,950
I couldn't even do it.

1071
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,630
You guys can't tell me to do something and it's the wrong information!

1072
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,880
Oh, I see how it is.

1073
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,760
What is this?

1074
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,000
Nothing?

1075
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:49,620
OK, it's nothing.

1076
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:54,050
Woah.

1077
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:56,550
Big orb.

1078
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,090
Divinity statue!

1079
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,250
An ominous power resides in this mysterious statue.

1080
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:09,510
If the blood of a demon is sacrificed to it, the power will be released.

1081
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,220
But I can only buy with orbs.

1082
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,560
I guess I don't really need anything then.

1083
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,840
Since I can only buy with the soul things, right?

1084
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,020
Destroy it?

1085
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,400
Can you?

1086
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,540
Oh, the style statue.

1087
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,320
I'm not there yet.

1088
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,080
Oh my gosh!

1089
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,400
You guys are...

1090
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,360
I just need to calm down, OK?

1091
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,000
You need to calm down with telling me what to do, OK?

1092
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,240
You need to calm down.

1093
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,360
I'm spritzing you right now with the water bottle.

1094
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:56,440
Calm down.

1095
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,020
Chat, calm down!

1096
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,380
Calm down!

1097
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,140
What the...

1098
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,060
She's so sexy.

1099
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:22,240
If the power is what you desire, it is with your skills you shall inspire.

1100
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,740
That's what they look like now.

1101
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:28,940
Oh my gosh.

1102
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,640
I can't even...

1103
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,010
I guess...

1104
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,130
What do you want me to get?

1105
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,250
Ah!

1106
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,540
I got it.

1107
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,060
Finally.

1108
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,260
This is like the longest mission ever.

1109
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,640
This don't look so good.

1110
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:09,920
Hello?

1111
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:10,660
Anybody home?

1112
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,960
Are you living in this universe with Sugg?

1113
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,020
No!

1114
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,790
Nero is so unphased.

1115
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:00,530
So me too.

1116
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,050
Me too then.

1117
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:01,770
I'm unphased.

1118
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,740
Not the casual walk, but...

1119
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,040
I'm gonna rev up, baby.

1120
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:13,640
I'm gonna rev up.

1121
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:21,330
Curious.

1122
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,250
Curious.

1123
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:25,650
Same.

1124
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:27,670
Dumb ectoplasm.

1125
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:30,290
I'm basically jelly.

1126
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,800
2000 years ago.

1127
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,240
Where were you when Dante was going and doing stuff?

1128
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,140
This guy is a nobody.

1129
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:30,520
I keep wasting my revs because I don't know how to use it yet.

1130
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:05,700
Ouch!

1131
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,500
I tried to do that, but I didn't.

1132
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,240
I don't know how to rev very well.

1133
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,820
How do

1134
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,210
you do the rev?

1135
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:25,860
No!

1136
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,900
My arm was too short!

1137
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,140
Oh my god!

1138
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,680
Holy cow!

1139
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,130
My health!

1140
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:51,930
I'm gonna die!

1141
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:52,770
I'm gonna die!

1142
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:57,750
My health!

1143
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,130
I do have a vital star.

1144
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,490
Maybe I should use it.

1145
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,910
Might be stupid, but...

1146
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,930
I feel like I'm so close with him.

1147
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,630
Let's just try it.

1148
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:24,150
I'm gonna ignore the revving up for now because it makes it so I can't move.

1149
01:20:27,830 --> 01:20:28,470
OK.

1150
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,510
Alright.

1151
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,350
I'm gonna get back into it.

1152
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:37,490
Please!

1153
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:42,550
Please!

1154
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,090
My arm!

1155
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,270
I wasted the star, you guys.

1156
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:51,430
I totally wasted the star!

1157
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:52,950
I totally wasted the star!

1158
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,070
It's good!

1159
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:55,110
No!

1160
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,830
Don't block you asshole!

1161
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,950
Yes!

1162
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:29,950
Oh my god!

1163
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:30,410
Oh my god!

1164
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:54,210
Let's bust her.

1165
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:05,930
Oh no!

1166
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:06,410
Phase 2?

1167
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,810
Oh no, he's gone.

1168
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:13,430
Oh yeah!

1169
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,490
Someone did say you can grab him earlier.

1170
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:16,110
That's right.

1171
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:20,010
I'll try the grab next time.

1172
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,640
First try!

1173
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,280
Don't worry about the vital star.

1174
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:50,060
Juni, I have no advice, but thank you for the Aqua Super.

1175
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,840
Thank you.

1176
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,100
Thank you so much!

1177
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,680
Yeah, what star?

1178
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,240
Exactly.

1179
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:04,320
I don't like that the...

1180
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,420
What?

1181
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,320
That part is inverted, but...

1182
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,580
Can I go in here?

1183
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:10,860
No?

1184
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:12,840
OK.

1185
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,100
Through here we go.

1186
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,070
Oh, that was the orbs.

1187
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:28,030
But I still got a B for stylish points.

1188
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,480
B for style.

1189
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,420
That's not so bad.

1190
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,020
It's not so bad.

1191
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,260
The white wing.

1192
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,720
Search for Tuna Castle.

1193
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,220
Alright.

1194
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,300
Let's power up, baby.

1195
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,420
Snatch!

1196
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,880
Snatch!

1197
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,500
Should I make my snatch longer?

1198
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,540
He's so snatched.

1199
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,780
Tuna Castle.

1200
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,000
Tuna Castle.

1201
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,580
What did I say?

1202
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,440
Wait, what are you saying?

1203
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,960
What did I say?

1204
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,770
Snatch has another meaning?

1205
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:50,860
I thought, like, snatched was like when you...

1206
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,520
You have, like, your waist is so small.

1207
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:58,720
It's snatched.

1208
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,080
It's boomer slang?

1209
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,220
What does it mean?

1210
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,420
Wait, so it means coochie and boomer?

1211
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:35,700
You guys are always joking about my age, but I hear you guys being like...

1212
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:47,240
The old wench said, speaketh of the snatch.

1213
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,300
How uncouth.

1214
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,400
You guys are calling yourselves out.

1215
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,480
You guys are calling yourselves out for your age.

1216
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,260
Very unladylike.

1217
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:25,880
Maiden Mint, how dareth you utter such terrible speakings?

1218
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,920
Just because you're old doesn't mean I'm not also old.

1219
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,880
I don't know.

1220
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,500
I didn't know what that meant.

1221
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:37,800
I didn't know.

1222
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,000
You're out here.

1223
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,980
You're out here.

1224
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,200
You're literally a caveman.

1225
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,780
You're like Oonga Boonga.

1226
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:45,560
VTuber.

1227
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,440
VTuber say.

1228
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,180
VTuber say.

1229
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:50,620
Silly word.

1230
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:51,860
Oonga Boonga.

1231
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:58,860
Literally, literally like cave drawing right here.

1232
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:07,260
You're like... You're drawing symbols and runes on the walls.

1233
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:14,380
Ye maiden mint doth proclaim thy looted scripts.

1234
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,110
Oonga Boonga.

1235
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,390
Anyway, what else we got?

1236
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,810
Let's see.

1237
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:29,130
Red Queen combo.

1238
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:32,610
Y Y, then Y Y Y Y.

1239
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,990
Y Y Y.

1240
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,170
Midair, press Y Y, then Y.

1241
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:39,390
Exceed.

1242
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:45,350
Increasing the X gauge to 2 slots allows you to access level 2 exceed moves.

1243
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:48,990
Oh, this is the gauge.

1244
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:49,330
Okay.

1245
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,830
What's that blue bar underneath?

1246
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,710
I don't have that.

1247
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,930
I don't have that.

1248
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:00,550
What's that?

1249
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,940
It's pre-Victorian slang.

1250
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,060
That's what I was saying.

1251
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,880
Wine or whiskey.

1252
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:17,900
They just get better with age and maturity.

1253
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,700
For revving, just tap it in between swings.

1254
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:31,760
I wasn't sure if you hold it down or tap it, but tapping seems to be the best way.

1255
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,460
Because you hold it down and it only gets you so much.

1256
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:37,320
This is coat made of denim.

1257
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,320
I don't know actually.

1258
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,220
We got the splits.

1259
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,020
Caliber.

1260
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,180
Woah.

1261
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,360
And the shuffle.

1262
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,300
And what else was there?

1263
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:53,920
Oh, blue rose is my gun.

1264
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,100
Oh yeah.

1265
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,020
Wait, I don't have charge shot, so...

1266
01:28:58,660 --> 01:28:59,220
Abilities.

1267
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,220
We could become faster.

1268
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:07,940
Which could be good, I think.

1269
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,960
Get more orbs.

1270
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:11,720
Morbs!

1271
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:11,840
Speed.

1272
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,300
Speed is mandatory?

1273
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:16,300
Oh really?

1274
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,380
Then I'll get speed.

1275
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,500
Oh, sorry.

1276
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:24,560
We'll get speed and we can also maybe get...

1277
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,340
There's something else.

1278
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:26,880
No?

1279
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,560
What was it?

1280
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,160
A devil bringer?

1281
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:28,920
A snatch!

1282
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,020
We could get both.

1283
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,020
Maybe.

1284
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:37,570
I feel like I use snatch so much.

1285
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,210
Combo 2.

1286
01:29:40,730 --> 01:29:41,830
What was combo 2?

1287
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:42,510
Oh, Y.

1288
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,250
Then Y.

1289
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:44,390
Then Y.

1290
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,300
Let's get snatch 2 first.

1291
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,000
I keep doing that.

1292
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:58,580
Oh, sorry.

1293
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:02,200
Maybe this is OK for now.

1294
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,560
Mission start!

1295
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:15,810
What's in here?

1296
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:17,450
Hello?

1297
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:17,550
Hello?

1298
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:22,570
Hello?

1299
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:26,430
I

1300
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,100
keep seeing daddy.

1301
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,220
So effortlessly even.

1302
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:58,820
Oh, OK.

1303
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,080
Let's go to the other side first.

1304
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,080
Daddy.

1305
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:06,380
Actually,

1306
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,220
I kind of like that they split up the currency.

1307
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,390
So now I can buy a bunch of items.

1308
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:24,960
I can buy a bunch of items and I don't have to decide whether I split between abilities or stuff.

1309
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,420
I actually kind of really appreciate that.

1310
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:41,940
Items casual.

1311
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,940
I can't believe you use items with the world map.

1312
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,560
That didn't work out as I thought it would.

1313
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,720
I should have grabbed it.

1314
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,500
I knew I was going to do that eventually.

1315
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:18,610
I knew I was going to call Dante at some point.

1316
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:23,770
Where am I?

1317
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,270
I can't see.

1318
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:33,090
OK, I give up.

1319
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:34,550
I have a lot of Rorb.

1320
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:35,730
It's fine.

1321
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,030
I can miss a Rorb.

1322
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:39,110
I won't cry about it.

1323
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,180
I got him.

1324
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,340
Oh, practice my revs.

1325
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:13,640
OK.

1326
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,360
New mechanic.

1327
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,780
I got to get used to it.

1328
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,720
I got to get...Oh my god.

1329
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,560
Him running.

1330
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,300
The speed thing is so strange.

1331
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,540
He starts so slow and then goes fast.

1332
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,860
What if Mito had a princess dress on?

1333
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:37,560
What do you mean by that?

1334
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:40,900
Battlestar!

1335
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:45,680
Taunt while speeding?

1336
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,600
What just happened?

1337
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:56,030
The Rorb you left is my dad.

1338
01:33:56,690 --> 01:33:57,930
Sorry for your dad.

1339
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,990
Oh no!

1340
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:01,810
Grab it!

1341
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:02,170
Grab it!

1342
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:02,510
Grab it!

1343
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,860
I didn't actually mean to do that, so it kind of worked out perfectly.

1344
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:12,740
Yeah!

1345
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,420
Oh my god, please!

1346
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:17,300
Please!

1347
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:18,620
Please, Nero!

1348
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,680
I can't see anything!

1349
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,740
Platforming is my worst enemy.

1350
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:30,100
Maybe I wouldn't be good at Catherine then if you guys say it's a platformer.

1351
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:33,740
OK.

1352
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,200
Alright.

1353
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:34,540
Alright.

1354
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:34,920
Here we go.

1355
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:35,240
Here we go.

1356
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:38,740
Oh.

1357
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:40,300
Wait.

1358
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,060
The camera angles are awkward.

1359
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,460
They are a little...

1360
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,500
Oh, I see.

1361
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,240
What the...

1362
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,320
But it doesn't go anywhere.

1363
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,560
Or does it?

1364
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,100
Am I crazy?

1365
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:00,660
Hold on.

1366
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:04,550
Oh!

1367
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:06,050
Wait, I think I saw it.

1368
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:07,570
Two!

1369
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,110
Joined 15 minutes ago.

1370
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:16,650
Never played a Devil May Cry game.

1371
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:19,290
Who is Dan, Tit, and Nero?

1372
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:34,350
Last hit of each combo is what gives a lot of style, so you should finish them.

1373
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:36,250
Finish what?

1374
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:39,810
OK.

1375
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:40,990
We are going to have to wall jump.

1376
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,160
I see it in my sights.

1377
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:49,620
I see it in my sights.

1378
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:50,340
OK.

1379
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:50,700
Hold on.

1380
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:02,450
OK.

1381
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:02,670
OK.

1382
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:02,910
OK.

1383
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:03,730
We got this.

1384
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,880
This is great practice though, no?

1385
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:15,080
Huh?

1386
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:22,800
Huh?

1387
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,500
I'm so confused actually.

1388
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,880
I can't jump in the air, so what do I do?

1389
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,720
I can't jump in the air, so what do I do?

1390
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,340
Should have farmed for air hike.

1391
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:39,580
True.

1392
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:40,860
Oh, shit.

1393
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,320
No, this is not...

1394
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,080
This is not a hot dog moment.

1395
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,100
It's pretty perfect.

1396
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:09,070
I don't think I can get it, no?

1397
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:12,770
I don't think I can get it.

1398
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:19,090
Please!

1399
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:33,170
Why can't we use ladders?

1400
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:33,770
I know!

1401
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:35,950
Can you move me there?

1402
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,190
No, it won't let me.

1403
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:39,070
Or, I'm trying.

1404
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:42,150
I'm pressing left.

1405
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,280
Oh, gosh!

1406
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:55,700
And then if I can't jump, I fall back.

1407
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,340
I feel like giving up.

1408
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:04,940
Please!

1409
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:09,820
See, I can't jump there, so...

1410
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:11,400
I...

1411
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:28,220
I've personally heard a group of blokes in year 10s say to my... What is this?

1412
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:33,760
Excuse me, I can't understand your accent.

1413
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:40,740
A group of blokes in year 10s say to my English teacher, I can smell your snatch from here.

1414
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,340
You smell like a fresh fish market.

1415
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,120
Okay, let's just keep going.

1416
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,300
Maybe we can come back.

1417
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,840
Maybe once I have air height.

1418
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,300
Oh, I'm silly.

1419
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:58,080
There we go.

1420
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:00,880
Oh, it's cold.

1421
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,260
Oh, I'm cold!

1422
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,940
Is this gonna... Okay.

1423
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,520
Oh my god, the camera angle is killing me.

1424
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:12,860
Please!

1425
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,680
Blimey!

1426
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,710
The moon is beautiful.

1427
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,750
So beautiful.

1428
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:40,030
Does this break?

1429
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:42,370
No, not everything breaks.

1430
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,710
Does this break?

1431
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:44,590
Yeah.

1432
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:45,930
Does this break?

1433
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,550
No.

1434
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:50,250
What constitutes is... It's gotta be real skinny.

1435
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,130
Gotta be a real skinny guy.

1436
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:56,590
Did you guys see the blood moon?

1437
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:02,050
I didn't realize it was a blood moon when I did see it.

1438
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,650
I was like, wow, blood moon!

1439
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:09,250
I don't think we are going back actually.

1440
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:14,170
Maybe we can go back for the blorb.

1441
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:17,670
Ah man.

1442
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:20,290
It was cloudy.

1443
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:20,890
Oh no!

1444
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:25,090
Sparta?

1445
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:27,350
Papa?

1446
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:30,230
Nope, just normal enemy.

1447
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:48,140
Holy shit!

1448
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,680
He does sound like he's saying hop to us sometimes, I'm not gonna lie.

1449
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,460
Yeah!

1450
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,480
You okay?

1451
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:27,370
There's so many things that break in this game.

1452
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:27,910
It's fine.

1453
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:34,010
I wish the whole game was stoic.

1454
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:38,190
It actually fits the aesthetic so well.

1455
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:45,880
Where am I going?

1456
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,120
Where did I come from?

1457
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,120
Map!

1458
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:54,120
Do I go this way?

1459
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:59,270
Okay, there's a door down here.

1460
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:00,330
What's the other way?

1461
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:03,210
Cotton eyed Joe.

1462
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:04,730
Where did he come from?

1463
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:05,430
Where did he go?

1464
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:06,730
Where did he come from?

1465
01:42:06,770 --> 01:42:07,630
Cotton eyed Joe.

1466
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,710
Anything up here?

1467
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:11,430
No.

1468
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:26,460
I've been married a long time ago.

1469
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,860
Can I not go this way anymore?

1470
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:29,400
This way?

1471
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,580
The game is telling me I'm an idiot.

1472
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,660
Oh maybe...wait, does this just go back?

1473
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,600
Oh, I'm backtracking.

1474
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,920
Oh okay, but we know now that we can.

1475
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:43,420
Okay, perfect.

1476
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,420
Orlando, welcome to membership.

1477
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:48,180
Thank you!

1478
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:50,320
Okay, cool.

1479
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:53,080
Here I thought I wouldn't be able to.

1480
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,220
Mr. Orange, I appreciate it, but please don't...

1481
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:01,860
Spoil...

1482
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:06,220
If I come to a story thing, I will...

1483
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,380
I will listen.

1484
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:29,580
Please guys, try to refrain from being like, okay this thing is coming up.

1485
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:35,610
Wait a second.

1486
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:35,750
Wait a minute.

1487
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:41,090
A maiden.

1488
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,440
Madame.

1489
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,910
I like her tail.

1490
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:04,430
So close.

1491
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:06,710
Oh my god, I'm getting out my magnifying glass.

1492
01:44:11,290 --> 01:44:12,150
Enhance!

1493
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:13,590
Slow motion!

1494
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,610
Slow motion!

1495
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:19,210
Ask and you shall receive!

1496
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:21,670
Nice.

1497
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:41,990
I did, I did.

1498
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:42,730
I helped you.

1499
01:44:44,370 --> 01:44:45,550
You saw everything?

1500
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,210
You're welcome.

1501
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:58,490
Gosh, I love Devil May Cry and their little grates that are way too big.

1502
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:01,510
Anyone's foot would slip right through.

1503
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:08,470
Charmed!

1504
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:30,570
Oh.

1505
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:38,350
He's shy!

1506
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,910
He's shy!

1507
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:43,010
Shy boy.

1508
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:49,570
He says, ma'am, I have a girl.

1509
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:57,790
Ma'am, I'm betrothed.

1510
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:01,170
What's her eye color?

1511
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,200
She's not your sister.

1512
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,560
What's up with this little section?

1513
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:22,460
I understand the importance of that scene now.

1514
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,260
Hello darkness, my old friend.

1515
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:34,800
I liked the plot.

1516
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,600
Yes, thank you.

1517
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,000
Looking kind of familiar.

1518
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:41,880
Yeah, just a little.

1519
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,240
What the hell is this?

1520
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:44,500
Hello?

1521
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:47,860
You do not have the power to destroy this rusted coffin.

1522
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,220
Only that which makes an impact will break it.

1523
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:52,020
Yeah, I did.

1524
01:46:56,360 --> 01:46:57,320
Just kidding.

1525
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:06,950
Do you like the plot?

1526
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:07,330
Yep.

1527
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:09,950
I like the plot.

1528
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,210
What is this thing?

1529
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,190
Nothing?

1530
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:14,690
Okay.

1531
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:15,270
Really?

1532
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:28,200
Maybe I should buy some lore.

1533
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,660
How much more does it... What does it go to?

1534
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,180
10,000?

1535
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,100
5,000!

1536
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:36,160
Okay, not bad.

1537
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,280
Why not?

1538
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,800
I wanna... I'll get some more holy water too.

1539
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:47,000
3 out of 6 though.

1540
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,960
Yeah, it's actually not so bad.

1541
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:53,080
Oh my god.

1542
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,380
Did you only think of that because of...

1543
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,700
Never played DMC4.

1544
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,700
I hope you feel better soon!

1545
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,520
That sucks!

1546
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:03,780
Feel better, feel better.

1547
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,600
Oh, how spooky this place...

1548
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,660
Remember how I said we were gonna get that money back?

1549
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,480
I hate chairs!

1550
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:23,720
Sitting's for bums!

1551
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,960
I have no ass!

1552
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:33,860
If I can't sit, no one can!

1553
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,220
Sorry.

1554
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,320
I wanted to get all the chairs.

1555
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:00,200
How much money is it?

1556
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:00,880
Oh, not that.

1557
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:03,040
8,000!

1558
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:04,720
Nice.

1559
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:10,920
Okay.

1560
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,460
I don't... Can we wall jump up to there or no?

1561
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:19,960
Oh, interesting.

1562
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:20,380
Okay.

1563
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:23,660
I didn't think... I didn't know if it would hurt me or what.

1564
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,120
So let's go in here.

1565
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:29,640
Just kidding, that isn't...

1566
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,460
No, just kidding.

1567
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:35,820
We'll go...

1568
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,200
It says it's a door though.

1569
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,880
You can see it on the map.

1570
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:40,160
That's a wall.

1571
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:42,040
No, you guys, look, look, look!

1572
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,360
You see it on the map?

1573
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:48,420
On the map it shows a little orange thing.

1574
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,480
Oh, it's upstairs.

1575
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:52,280
That's so confusing!

1576
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,460
That's so confusing!

1577
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,220
Did I get another...

1578
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,880
Did I get another...

1579
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,940
I can't remember what skill I got.

1580
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,360
Let's just keep going.

1581
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,040
Where are you?

1582
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,840
No, my arm is too short!

1583
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,760
Come here!

1584
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:01,180
Yeah, we need the long snatch.

1585
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,020
The longest snatch.

1586
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:04,680
What's this?

1587
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:08,780
Special seal lies over the enormous door.

1588
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,900
An inscription on the table reads...

1589
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:13,020
Collect the four statues and open the way to the arena.

1590
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:14,820
The arena!

1591
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:16,940
Okay.

1592
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:19,280
I like how it gives you a...

1593
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:19,420
Hello?

1594
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:20,200
Where?

1595
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:21,660
Whoops!

1596
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:27,180
No.

1597
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:28,620
Oh, there.

1598
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:02,320
Okay, there's so much...

1599
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:02,840
There's so much here.

1600
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:05,520
I'm feeling like we're...

1601
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,960
This place is humongous!

1602
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,420
Which way do I go?

1603
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,340
Oh my god, this place is humongous!

1604
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:12,260
There's so many doors!

1605
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,760
I have to start at one.

1606
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:17,400
A gyro blade is enshrined beyond this obstacle.

1607
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:20,320
Only that which makes an impact will remove the obstacle.

1608
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,760
Oh, this is the thing, like the coffin, right?

1609
01:52:30,570 --> 01:52:33,490
Let's go back to whence we came.

1610
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:34,710
There's so many doors!

1611
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:38,070
Okay, so

1612
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:48,170
there was...

1613
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:52,430
This is where I came from.

1614
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:53,830
Right there.

1615
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:57,150
And inside, there's more stuff in there.

1616
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:59,090
And I can't get in.

1617
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:03,270
Anything down here?

1618
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:04,550
Oh, what's that?

1619
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,990
That looks mysterious.

1620
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,450
No?

1621
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:27,590
A painting of nothing.

1622
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:33,710
Okay, let's go into the first door.

1623
01:53:34,290 --> 01:53:35,210
Door number one.

1624
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:44,080
Yes!

1625
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,840
There's so many things to destroy.

1626
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,000
It's your birthday!

1627
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,660
Your two favorite game series, Metal Gear and Devil May Cry.

1628
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:54,960
Keep being awesome.

1629
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:55,960
Thank you!

1630
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,140
Wait, he'll die.

1631
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,760
Okay, I thought I could destroy those.

1632
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,000
Happy birthday to you!

1633
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,400
Happy birthday to you!

1634
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,080
Happy birthday, Major Reception!

1635
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:13,340
Happy birthday to you!

1636
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,500
Happy birthday!

1637
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:19,860
Yeah!

1638
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:25,780
Hallway.

1639
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:30,740
Wait!

1640
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,180
Is this not...

1641
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:35,180
The thing that we need?

1642
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,760
What is this?

1643
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,780
To proceed further, the power to repel fire must be obtained.

1644
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:43,900
A gyro blade.

1645
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:45,920
Is it a gyro blade or a gyro blade?

1646
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:46,560
I can't tell.

1647
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,500
It can be used as a shield.

1648
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:53,540
Okay, playing baseball again.

1649
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:56,520
I can't do this yet, I don't think.

1650
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:02,520
Alright!

1651
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:05,940
Next door.

1652
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:08,460
To explore.

1653
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,520
Can't go through the Colosseum door yet.

1654
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:14,760
All the way down here.

1655
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:20,430
There's this door.

1656
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:23,030
Let's go one at a time, baby!

1657
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:28,010
I took two steps!

1658
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:36,050
I

1659
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:56,990
don't know if me doing my gun really does much, to be honest.

1660
01:56:03,170 --> 01:56:04,370
We got an A!

1661
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,190
Atomic!

1662
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,440
Gun is for combo extensions or charge shots.

1663
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:40,360
Yeah, I don't have the charge shot yet.

1664
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:44,400
So...

1665
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,120
Onwards.

1666
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:58,180
No, no, no, what's this?

1667
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:02,660
You do not have the power to destroy this rusted statue, only that would make an...

1668
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,180
I can't do any of this stuff!

1669
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,320
I don't like that.

1670
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:16,340
Wait, I really don't like this.

1671
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:25,460
I know you guys are probably like, Rev, please, Rev!

1672
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:28,620
I'll learn eventually, I promise.

1673
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:29,380
Maybe.

1674
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:30,300
Somehow.

1675
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,400
I'll do it eventually.

1676
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:41,780
Oh,

1677
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:45,480
man.

1678
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,660
Yeah, I'll rev now.

1679
01:57:48,740 --> 01:57:49,500
I'll rev now.

1680
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:53,600
Oh, it's this room again!

1681
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,520
Do I have to do like a... I didn't do anything there.

1682
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:49,840
Hold it longer.

1683
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:01,100
She's locked and loaded, baby.

1684
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:03,940
Will it go away?

1685
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,220
You can rev while attacking?

1686
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,040
It stays?

1687
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:14,960
Oh, shoot.

1688
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:15,540
Let's go.

1689
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:18,020
Okay.

1690
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:22,180
Oh, I think...

1691
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:27,360
Okay, do I have to be really quick about getting the other one or else it disappears?

1692
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,980
You can shoot while you rev.

1693
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:32,840
Oh my gosh.

1694
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:40,820
This...

1695
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:41,280
Oh!

1696
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:43,020
What the hell just hit me?

1697
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,040
What did I do?

1698
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:51,240
I'm getting all my practice in.

1699
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:52,540
But

1700
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,140
it's not doing anything!

1701
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:01,460
It's not doing anything!

1702
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:37,480
I'm like alternating, but I even still can't do that.

1703
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:37,540
What?

1704
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:42,760
I did it a few times.

1705
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,840
Yeah, I didn't notice, but I don't know how I did it.

1706
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:49,300
I don't know how I did it.

1707
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:51,960
I don't want to keep doing this over and over again.

1708
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,020
We gotta lock in.

1709
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:58,720
We gotta lock in.

1710
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,520
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1711
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:13,060
Okay, okay, okay.

1712
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:23,330
Yeah, I am getting lots of money.

1713
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:24,050
That's the truth.

1714
02:01:57,180 --> 02:01:58,140
Roar farming.

1715
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:00,700
What is this?

1716
02:02:01,140 --> 02:02:02,820
Almost platforming.

1717
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:05,780
Pseudo-platforming.

1718
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:17,820
But it seems like you just kinda have to let it happen.

1719
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:24,380
You just gotta kinda let... You gotta just kinda do it and let it do it's thing.

1720
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:24,920
Maybe?

1721
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:29,880
Okay.

1722
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,030
Only that one.

1723
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:38,790
Okay.

1724
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:40,330
Alright.

1725
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:42,730
Which ones disappear?

1726
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:43,470
I'm checking.

1727
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:50,190
Okay.

1728
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:52,930
I did it!

1729
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:57,530
Where am I?

1730
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,130
I'm upstairs!

1731
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:02,350
Where the barrier was.

1732
02:03:06,660 --> 02:03:10,040
I think I have to go to the little ghosties room.

1733
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:17,860
Hello?

1734
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:20,280
No.

1735
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,420
Missing air hike right now.

1736
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:24,420
Oh, okay.

1737
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,720
I have to go to the little ghosties room.

1738
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:27,400
I'm gonna also get some tea.

1739
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:28,940
Or some more water.

1740
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,200
Tea or water.

1741
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:31,760
I don't know.

1742
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,700
Everybody stretch.

1743
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:42,880
That felt good.

1744
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,260
Okay.

1745
02:03:46,780 --> 02:03:48,580
Tea or water.

1746
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:54,400
Everybody get some... get some...

1747
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:58,060
Get some water or something.

1748
02:03:58,380 --> 02:03:59,000
Okay, very good.

1749
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:44,360
Did you wash your hands?

1750
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,820
Did you wash your hands?

1751
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:49,480
Everybody.

1752
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,460
Come back.

1753
02:06:53,420 --> 02:06:54,180
Let's go.

1754
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:57,280
Let's go.

1755
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:00,560
Sorry, I didn't realize that the music was completely off.

1756
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:02,860
Just sitting here in silence.

1757
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:09,660
My cat's in here, so inevitably I will have to let her out in like two minutes probably.

1758
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:18,100
There was nothing else, right?

1759
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:18,980
It was just this hall.

1760
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,140
Oh, besides the... besides the roar.

1761
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:25,780
That I don't know how to get to.

1762
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,200
Maybe from here?

1763
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:29,220
No.

1764
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:35,310
Yeah, it's pies.

1765
02:07:36,350 --> 02:07:38,850
She loves to come in here.

1766
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:42,430
Run!

1767
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:44,730
So fast.

1768
02:07:46,190 --> 02:07:47,050
What the?

1769
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,710
Oh, it's these guys again.

1770
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:50,810
Come in.

1771
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:51,910
Can I grab you?

1772
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:10,420
Yeah!

1773
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:13,020
That's what I wanted to do.

1774
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,360
I wanted to...

1775
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,600
Where are you?

1776
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,260
The time has come and so have I.

1777
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:40,920
Freak.

1778
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,960
Oh, Freak Phantom of the Wise!

1779
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:45,040
What is your daily wisdom?

1780
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,580
Before drinking your hot tea...

1781
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:52,900
Take at least... or...

1782
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:59,400
Blow at least five times.

1783
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:16,740
This place is so huge!

1784
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,820
I don't know where I am.

1785
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:20,460
I'm so lost.

1786
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:21,720
Everything is so confusing.

1787
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,980
This feels like the longest mission in history.

1788
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:26,200
Is this game so much longer?

1789
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:31,520
Oh wait, I can get that with a grab.

1790
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:37,350
No?

1791
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:38,310
I'm just stupid?

1792
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:43,390
Why is this mission so long then?

1793
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,960
What was the point of this area?

1794
02:10:03,950 --> 02:10:06,750
By your hand you cannot break our clasp.

1795
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:08,790
That power lies in another grasp.

1796
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:13,810
Oh, clasp.

1797
02:10:13,950 --> 02:10:14,870
Wait, did I say clasp?

1798
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,030
What do I need?

1799
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:22,470
Later?

1800
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:23,570
Ok, I'll come back.

1801
02:10:24,070 --> 02:10:27,290
Am I... I don't even remember what the mission... Oh, the mission is like what?

1802
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:28,170
Explore or whatever?

1803
02:10:29,570 --> 02:10:30,670
Well, I'm exploring.

1804
02:10:31,350 --> 02:10:32,570
I'm exploring the castle.

1805
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:09,020
Thank you!

1806
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:17,570
Catch this!

1807
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:22,010
Nero got that CQC.

1808
02:11:22,770 --> 02:11:23,810
Yeah, I do.

1809
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:27,210
Ok, now I'm on the other side.

1810
02:11:28,170 --> 02:11:29,630
Alright, we're still exploring.

1811
02:11:30,290 --> 02:11:31,050
This is a thing.

1812
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:39,950
Alright, I have performed a function.

1813
02:11:41,110 --> 02:11:41,930
Wait, did I?

1814
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:44,450
Oh, there we go.

1815
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:47,490
I completed the function.

1816
02:11:52,530 --> 02:11:54,650
The door that confused me earlier.

1817
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:56,390
Screw you door!

1818
02:12:00,190 --> 02:12:03,450
Oh my god,

1819
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:55,380
I'm stuck at this.

1820
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:57,120
I'm stuck at this.

1821
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:00,800
Come

1822
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:04,900
on, I want S!

1823
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:05,600
Please!

1824
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:08,840
I was so close.

1825
02:13:09,460 --> 02:13:10,540
I was so close!

1826
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:14,180
The taunts...

1827
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:18,960
There's too much to remember!

1828
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:34,840
Rev, taunt, style, dis, wow, jump, scream, yell, excite, duel, jump, rev, style, taunt...

1829
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:35,680
There's too much!

1830
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:38,740
There's too much.

1831
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:52,160
Hold on, my chat broke.

1832
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,440
Give me one second.

1833
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:55,800
Hold on.

1834
02:14:15,150 --> 02:14:15,750
Dante.

1835
02:14:17,330 --> 02:14:18,630
Brooding in the corner.

1836
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:20,870
Do I not need this thing?

1837
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:27,910
I'm not gonna remember my way around here.

1838
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:31,570
What is this?

1839
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:36,030
Oh, it's one of you.

1840
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:38,410
I couldn't tell what it was from the side.

1841
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:41,510
Wait, I do need to go back down here.

1842
02:14:42,290 --> 02:14:44,490
And go through, just kidding, through here!

1843
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:53,970
Okay.

1844
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:59,680
Making progress, I suppose.

1845
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:12,960
Hey,

1846
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:16,360
stop.

1847
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:17,080
I'm self-conscious.

1848
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,380
I am the demon.

1849
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:25,160
Can you not tell?

1850
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:26,620
Why would you turn your back on him?

1851
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:39,500
The book stopped my knowledge!

1852
02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:46,480
Yeah, I do that too.

1853
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:47,020
I rev.

1854
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:07,510
Oh, I need to parry.

1855
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:16,820
Wait, I got an achievement, but...

1856
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:18,660
Where is he?

1857
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:19,820
Oh, there he is.

1858
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:33,640
I'm trying to parry, but...

1859
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:38,960
Oh, there's more!

1860
02:17:16,650 --> 02:17:18,830
Oh gosh, I wish I had air height right now!

1861
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:30,560
Oh, I did it!

1862
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:37,120
I

1863
02:17:46,460 --> 02:17:49,160
like that you can just...

1864
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:57,220
You can do whatever that was with their sword.

1865
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:00,340
Is that the thing I needed?

1866
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:03,280
Am I gonna become all powerful?

1867
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:06,560
Brutal!

1868
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:12,380
Give me some orbs, please.

1869
02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:15,120
This looks like I can...

1870
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:16,640
Oh, nice.

1871
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:18,020
Thank you, game.

1872
02:18:18,220 --> 02:18:19,040
Thank you, game.

1873
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:20,540
Oh, give me my money.

1874
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:21,700
Thank you, game.

1875
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:25,380
So, once I get that, I should be able to...

1876
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:27,420
Be for bananas!

1877
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:30,360
Oh, there we go.

1878
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:32,460
What is it?

1879
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:34,160
What is this?

1880
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:34,340
What is this?

1881
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:38,400
Yummy.

1882
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:41,840
It's herb.

1883
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:49,320
So if you put it in that, does it ignite it and make it move?

1884
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:51,340
Anime!

1885
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:53,900
Anime.

1886
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:54,840
Oh, sorry.

1887
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:07,070
Anima Mercury!

1888
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:12,170
An artificial soul made using alchemy breathes life into the anima.

1889
02:19:15,170 --> 02:19:18,430
Oh my god, this one hour mission is finally over.

1890
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:19,770
It was only 35 minutes?

1891
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:26,370
You guys, I got an A on stylish points.

1892
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:27,750
That's huge for me.

1893
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:30,890
Yippee!

1894
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:34,070
What time is it?

1895
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:36,230
Oh, sorry.

1896
02:19:36,330 --> 02:19:36,770
Hold on.

1897
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:42,850
That felt like the longest mission ever in the history of the world.

1898
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:50,270
Use your newly earned powers to gather the four gyro yuro blades.

1899
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:55,250
What should we learn?

1900
02:19:55,350 --> 02:19:56,070
Or should we...

1901
02:19:58,810 --> 02:19:59,650
Save up.

1902
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:07,500
It does kind of suck that I have to wait over and over and over again.

1903
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:10,140
Air hike, I don't have the money.

1904
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,020
Save up for air hike then maybe.

1905
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:15,780
It's pronounced like hero.

1906
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:16,940
So yuro.

1907
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:19,500
It's not gyro.

1908
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,840
How are you ever supposed to know the difference?

1909
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:43,800
Oh yeah, if I were to get like a new combo.

1910
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,060
To get more style points.

1911
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:56,740
Then that would potentially get me more soul stuff.

1912
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,780
And then we could re-find later.

1913
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:02,420
That's how you play the game, huh?

1914
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,420
That's how you play the game, huh?

1915
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:21,880
I feel like I need an in-air thing.

1916
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:24,720
Because I do like the...

1917
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:29,040
The one that puts them in the air and then I feel like I'm...

1918
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:30,520
So I'm going to try this.

1919
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:32,940
I do this every time.

1920
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:35,720
Grab that and then...

1921
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:41,560
Oh, I don't have enough for streak 2.

1922
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:42,400
No!

1923
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:50,710
That spin is stylish.

1924
02:21:52,090 --> 02:21:52,570
Stylish!

1925
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:54,270
Caliber is an air thing.

1926
02:21:54,370 --> 02:21:54,930
What's this one?

1927
02:21:55,130 --> 02:21:56,470
I don't have enough for this one either.

1928
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:57,010
Shoot.

1929
02:21:57,010 --> 02:22:00,010
Well, then I will do...

1930
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:03,110
We'll do combo C.

1931
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:05,470
Because...

1932
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:07,030
Actually...

1933
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:08,850
Yeah, we'll do combo C.

1934
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:10,070
We'll try it.

1935
02:22:12,070 --> 02:22:13,070
Caliber is good.

1936
02:22:13,350 --> 02:22:14,270
Should I have gotten that one?

1937
02:22:14,430 --> 02:22:15,310
Oh yeah, it's fine.

1938
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:15,870
It's fine.

1939
02:22:16,490 --> 02:22:17,090
What's that one again?

1940
02:22:20,410 --> 02:22:24,070
I find myself probably using this one more.

1941
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:26,990
Y, Y, pause, then Y.

1942
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:28,250
Y, Y, pause, Y.

1943
02:22:28,930 --> 02:22:29,290
Okay.

1944
02:22:33,070 --> 02:22:34,350
Yeah, it's an aerial stinger.

1945
02:22:34,450 --> 02:22:34,970
That's crazy.

1946
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:36,890
Sorry, I know I keep looking.

1947
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:37,950
I keep going back and forth.

1948
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:41,150
Y, Y, then Y, Y, Y, Y.

1949
02:22:41,450 --> 02:22:42,890
Y, Y, Y, Y, Y.

1950
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:43,250
Alright.

1951
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:45,430
Blorb, you know it.

1952
02:22:46,170 --> 02:22:47,170
You know it, baby.

1953
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:51,010
Or do I get a holy water?

1954
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:52,790
Or like...

1955
02:22:52,790 --> 02:22:55,530
We can get the holy waters once we max out the blorb.

1956
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:01,600
Because blorb...

1957
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:04,080
Like, it's permanent.

1958
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:09,410
Okay.

1959
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:10,730
But why?

1960
02:23:11,050 --> 02:23:12,310
I don't know, actually.

1961
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:16,310
Mito paste.

1962
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:17,090
Thank you!

1963
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,110
Alright.

1964
02:23:21,350 --> 02:23:22,210
Alive.

1965
02:23:23,510 --> 02:23:24,370
Alive.

1966
02:23:24,370 --> 02:23:24,450
Alive.

1967
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:32,050
Okay.

1968
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:35,510
Oh my goodness.

1969
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:36,710
What the hell?

1970
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:45,180
What?

1971
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:02,460
You can build up... wait.

1972
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:08,440
By striking the euro blade with your sword before moving it with the buster, you can build up energy and release a huge destructive force.

1973
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:10,900
So basically we've created a new weapon.

1974
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:16,640
So if I'm like...

1975
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:19,340
Maybe...

1976
02:24:23,650 --> 02:24:25,610
Oh, I missed it entirely.

1977
02:24:27,050 --> 02:24:27,930
I missed it.

1978
02:24:28,750 --> 02:24:29,590
Okay, okay.

1979
02:24:38,620 --> 02:24:39,140
Okay.

1980
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:39,460
Okay.

1981
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:43,960
Euro is the food.

1982
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:44,980
Gyro is the mechanism.

1983
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:45,880
So you don't want to eat it.

1984
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:47,480
Well, everybody kept saying it's a euro!

1985
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:52,380
Everybody, it wasn't me!

1986
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:54,340
Oh, dang it.

1987
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:54,620
Okay.

1988
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:57,380
I'm just gonna...

1989
02:24:57,380 --> 02:24:58,520
I'm just gonna do this.

1990
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:02,980
I thought it was gyro because it was the way it...

1991
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:04,680
I was like, yeah, like a gyroscope.

1992
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:05,240
No?

1993
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:07,280
Aww.

1994
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:09,000
No, I can't take you with me.

1995
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:12,300
So sad.

1996
02:25:15,860 --> 02:25:17,160
Wait, what's this?

1997
02:25:18,380 --> 02:25:19,380
Is there a second level?

1998
02:25:22,220 --> 02:25:23,840
Maybe I can crash this door?

1999
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:25,660
Oh.

2000
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:28,340
Oh my gosh, it's so powerful.

2001
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:37,160
Okay.

2002
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:43,620
Eh?

2003
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:43,740
Eh?

2004
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:47,180
I can't fit maybe.

2005
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:47,580
Eh?

2006
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:48,220
How do I get in?

2007
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:48,820
Is it...

2008
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:50,280
Is it upstairs?

2009
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,740
I don't see anything up there though.

2010
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:53,580
Oh wait, yeah.

2011
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:54,660
I don't...

2012
02:25:55,220 --> 02:25:55,460
Eh?

2013
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:58,180
You guys see the map?

2014
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:05,460
I guess it's nothing.

2015
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:09,040
But what's the map for then?

2016
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:18,680
It's a later mission.

2017
02:26:18,940 --> 02:26:20,120
Oh, okay, okay.

2018
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:24,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2019
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:34,160
Oh yeah.

2020
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:35,860
Again.

2021
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:45,650
Oh my gosh, it's this guy!

2022
02:26:46,930 --> 02:26:48,410
Why are the ice men in here?

2023
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:55,770
What was the combo again?

2024
02:26:55,950 --> 02:26:56,230
I don't...

2025
02:26:57,090 --> 02:26:58,110
Shoot, I don't remember.

2026
02:27:05,610 --> 02:27:06,250
It was...

2027
02:27:06,250 --> 02:27:06,850
Why?

2028
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:07,430
Why?

2029
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:11,810
Wait,

2030
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:21,000
wait, hold on.

2031
02:27:21,060 --> 02:27:21,840
I need you to go in here.

2032
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:25,220
Stop turning around!

2033
02:27:32,660 --> 02:27:33,840
Oh, I have to lock on, that's why.

2034
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,560
I'm silly.

2035
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:38,840
Oh, he doesn't go in the air.

2036
02:27:40,100 --> 02:27:40,440
Why?

2037
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:40,760
Why?

2038
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:41,400
Why?

2039
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:50,260
Wait, what was it?

2040
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:50,660
Why?

2041
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:50,920
Why?

2042
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:52,040
Why?

2043
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:52,960
Why?

2044
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:53,460
Why?

2045
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:53,820
Why?

2046
02:27:54,220 --> 02:27:55,420
I don't think I did it right.

2047
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:56,260
Ouch!

2048
02:27:58,580 --> 02:27:59,020
Why?

2049
02:27:59,200 --> 02:27:59,560
Why?

2050
02:27:59,860 --> 02:28:00,300
Why?

2051
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:00,980
Why?

2052
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:01,520
Why?

2053
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:02,020
Why?

2054
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:02,320
Okay.

2055
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:28,790
Tell me why.

2056
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:33,870
Unleash him!

2057
02:28:35,230 --> 02:28:36,690
Did we take you home with us?

2058
02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:38,470
Oh wait, I could have used you in battle.

2059
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:41,450
Okay.

2060
02:28:46,900 --> 02:28:48,380
He's in harmony with that blue coffin.

2061
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:50,240
The coffin must be summoning a...

2062
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:52,800
Gyro.

2063
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:55,180
It wants a blade!

2064
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:56,640
It wants a blade!

2065
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:56,900
A blade!

2066
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:00,300
Oh, that's upstairs.

2067
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:01,480
That's a wall.

2068
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:02,600
I've learned my lesson.

2069
02:29:05,430 --> 02:29:07,720
Where is one though that we can summon?

2070
02:29:26,120 --> 02:29:29,600
Oh farming, oh farming, oh farming.

2071
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:34,040
Oh farming, oh farming, oh farming.

2072
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,180
Farming for rorbs.

2073
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:39,340
Farming for rorbs.

2074
02:29:39,340 --> 02:29:43,340
Every day I'm farming for rorbs.

2075
02:29:44,620 --> 02:29:47,340
Oh farming, oh farming, oh farming.

2076
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:51,760
How I love the farming.

2077
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:59,520
Every day, every way, I'm farming, I'm farming, I'm farming.

2078
02:30:04,770 --> 02:30:08,090
It's a respectable job.

2079
02:30:09,890 --> 02:30:11,810
Someone's got a door.

2080
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:15,670
Someone's got to clean the door.

2081
02:30:15,710 --> 02:30:16,290
Oh here we go.

2082
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:18,390
Okay.

2083
02:30:19,950 --> 02:30:21,150
Little girl, hold on.

2084
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:22,750
Don't go over there.

2085
02:30:23,570 --> 02:30:24,470
Please don't go over there.

2086
02:30:25,230 --> 02:30:27,370
Hold on, I've got to stop my cat from causing mischief.

2087
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:27,930
Hey!

2088
02:30:28,210 --> 02:30:28,450
Hey!

2089
02:30:28,610 --> 02:30:28,890
Stop it!

2090
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:29,170
Stop!

2091
02:30:29,630 --> 02:30:29,870
Stop!

2092
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:30,270
Stop!

2093
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,520
Little girl, you're so sweet.

2094
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:36,660
Did you run out?

2095
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,420
Okay, hold on.

2096
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:41,180
Let me let my cat out.

2097
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:02,200
Okay.

2098
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:07,200
She always tries to jump on top of the pachinko machine.

2099
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:11,280
So I have to be like, don't do that.

2100
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:15,200
I have to be like, no ma'am.

2101
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:16,380
Wait on.

2102
02:31:20,840 --> 02:31:21,300
Yay!

2103
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:22,500
First try.

2104
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:24,880
What's this?

2105
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:26,480
Oh.

2106
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:28,540
The seal is quite peculiar.

2107
02:31:29,540 --> 02:31:34,160
The magical power within is palpable, but there is no hope of controlling it.

2108
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,300
Oh, okay.

2109
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:40,600
Old Mint Donald had a...

2110
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:41,040
Oh, stop!

2111
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:41,520
Stop!

2112
02:31:41,560 --> 02:31:42,100
I'm trying to get away.

2113
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:48,520
And on that farm she has some rorbs.

2114
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:50,780
E-I-E-I-O.

2115
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:54,760
With a brown brown here and a brown brown there.

2116
02:31:54,940 --> 02:31:56,620
Here's a brown, there's a brown everywhere.

2117
02:31:59,300 --> 02:31:59,780
Okay.

2118
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:00,940
Oh gosh.

2119
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,040
Where do I go from here then?

2120
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,020
I guess we...

2121
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:12,020
Were there any doors on this side that I haven't tried?

2122
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:14,840
I mean, obviously I know that there's like a...

2123
02:32:14,840 --> 02:32:16,800
Oh yeah, there's this door here.

2124
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:20,420
There was other stuff that we can do now because we have...

2125
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:21,580
I'm in the torture chamber.

2126
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:22,480
Okay, awesome.

2127
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:23,980
Nevermind, not awesome.

2128
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:25,660
Not awesome!

2129
02:32:31,620 --> 02:32:32,300
No,

2130
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:49,100
it keeps getting worse!

2131
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:21,820
Dash!

2132
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:26,680
Did you hear the achievement?

2133
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:29,580
Yippee!

2134
02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:37,920
I don't need to be back in here, do I?

2135
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:42,400
This is where...

2136
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:45,180
Why was there...

2137
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:45,640
Oh wait.

2138
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,700
Okay, we need a thing.

2139
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:02,840
Aww.

2140
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:06,880
The fireball room.

2141
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:07,860
Where was that?

2142
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:15,540
Okay, so it is left click.

2143
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,180
Alright, cool.

2144
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:22,780
I don't need to do the puzzle again, but if I fall I have to fight all the guys again.

2145
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:24,600
So I'm just gonna do the puzzle.

2146
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:27,760
I'm just gonna do the puzzle so that...

2147
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:31,360
First floor?

2148
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:32,960
It was?

2149
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:36,200
I can just leave?

2150
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:38,500
I guess that's true.

2151
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:42,460
This is so much easier.

2152
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:42,880
Wait.

2153
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:45,880
How do I leave?

2154
02:34:50,670 --> 02:34:51,810
What was this room?

2155
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:56,220
What was this area?

2156
02:34:56,480 --> 02:34:57,200
I don't remember.

2157
02:34:57,300 --> 02:34:57,560
Hold on.

2158
02:34:57,660 --> 02:34:58,980
Sorry guys, I'm trying to get my bearings.

2159
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:11,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2160
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:13,220
That's what that tunnel was.

2161
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:15,180
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2162
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:18,840
Alright, hold on.

2163
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:20,340
Okay, okay, okay.

2164
02:35:23,740 --> 02:35:24,700
This door?

2165
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:27,280
What was this door?

2166
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:29,300
Did I go through this door?

2167
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:31,720
There's too many doors.

2168
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,760
Reacting in an unknown manner.

2169
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:40,240
Oh, I should have...

2170
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:45,120
I should have gone in here first.

2171
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:48,220
Oh!

2172
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:55,300
I sequence broke a little bit.

2173
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:56,680
Oopsie!

2174
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:00,440
Oh, and then...

2175
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:01,860
This is...

2176
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:04,680
Is this the fire... This is the fireball room.

2177
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:07,220
No, it's not.

2178
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:09,040
lol

2179
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:24,620
This is the fireball room?

2180
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:30,540
Yes!

2181
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:33,860
Yes.

2182
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:38,160
Oh no, it's these guys.

2183
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:08,220
Nice!

2184
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:11,140
Progress!

2185
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:15,100
Somehow, we finally made some progress, maybe.

2186
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:17,540
Well, we're getting there, we're getting there.

2187
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:21,440
This area is just so big.

2188
02:37:23,080 --> 02:37:24,460
It's so big!

2189
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:27,620
My little brain can't keep up.

2190
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:31,260
And I actually have a pretty decent sense of direction.

2191
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:33,600
So...

2192
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,680
OK, there's the fireball.

2193
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:37,760
OK, so how do I deflect it?

2194
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:39,120
Oh!

2195
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:41,940
lol I see.

2196
02:37:53,500 --> 02:37:55,880
No, I do actually, you guys!

2197
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:59,000
I actually do have a good sense of direction.

2198
02:38:02,180 --> 02:38:04,000
You guys just don't think I do.

2199
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:07,800
Oh!

2200
02:38:08,280 --> 02:38:12,040
lol It's true though!

2201
02:38:16,710 --> 02:38:18,070
Can I get behind him?

2202
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:42,770
Secret.

2203
02:38:45,770 --> 02:38:46,890
Let's go away.

2204
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:48,930
What's the secret?

2205
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,680
Successfully execute a mid-air buster five times without touching the ground.

2206
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:00,260
What's a mid-air buster?

2207
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:05,380
lol I like how it's called ALU.

2208
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:19,880
Oh.

2209
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:21,720
How?

2210
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:24,140
I've touched the ground so easily though.

2211
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:28,640
Wait.

2212
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:34,000
Immediately, like, I haven't done a single one.

2213
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:36,080
What am I doing wrong?

2214
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:44,260
No, no, hold on.

2215
02:39:45,360 --> 02:39:46,580
I'm trying to do...

2216
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:47,700
No!

2217
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:50,740
How many are you?

2218
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:52,040
Where are you?

2219
02:40:10,690 --> 02:40:11,350
Wait, hold on.

2220
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:12,810
Come on, go in the air.

2221
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:18,090
Wait, do I have to...

2222
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:19,030
Oh, I think...

2223
02:40:19,030 --> 02:40:20,750
Okay, I'm just grabbing it, but...

2224
02:40:20,750 --> 02:40:21,230
Okay, hold on.

2225
02:40:21,530 --> 02:40:21,730
Oops.

2226
02:40:27,070 --> 02:40:27,390
Ah!

2227
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:27,930
See?

2228
02:40:28,070 --> 02:40:28,190
See?

2229
02:40:28,350 --> 02:40:28,450
See?

2230
02:40:28,450 --> 02:40:28,510
See?

2231
02:40:32,990 --> 02:40:33,930
Okay, nevermind.

2232
02:40:34,030 --> 02:40:34,350
I give up.

2233
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:38,050
That?

2234
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:41,170
Without hitting the ground?

2235
02:40:41,330 --> 02:40:41,770
Hell no.

2236
02:40:43,350 --> 02:40:44,930
At least I was able to do it though.

2237
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:47,370
I did one.

2238
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:59,110
And this is why I basically never do the secret missions.

2239
02:41:01,850 --> 02:41:03,510
At least you know how you can air grab now.

2240
02:41:03,590 --> 02:41:04,330
I know, right?

2241
02:41:05,070 --> 02:41:05,830
We learned.

2242
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:08,350
Oh, ouch.

2243
02:41:18,550 --> 02:41:19,830
Damn, I keep trying.

2244
02:41:20,210 --> 02:41:21,130
I'm not very good at it.

2245
02:41:21,430 --> 02:41:22,530
There we go, yeah!

2246
02:41:35,670 --> 02:41:36,290
Oh, wait.

2247
02:41:40,350 --> 02:41:41,010
Slam dunk!

2248
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:56,560
Rev, rev, rev, rev, rev, rev.

2249
02:41:58,260 --> 02:42:00,500
Rev, rev, rev, rev, rev, rev, rev.

2250
02:42:01,860 --> 02:42:04,420
So you have to rev it at the same time as hitting?

2251
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:16,520
Basically...

2252
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:18,320
Maybe I'm not doing it right though.

2253
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:24,560
I'm glad the doors don't attack you anymore.

2254
02:42:25,350 --> 02:42:26,560
It's like a rhythm game.

2255
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:29,300
I'll have to keep practicing with it.

2256
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:32,280
I'll have to keep practicing.

2257
02:42:32,740 --> 02:42:34,440
Gosh, this game is so generous.

2258
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:41,020
With rorbs and grorbs and grorbs and everything.

2259
02:42:41,940 --> 02:42:43,100
Wait, this thing.

2260
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:57,570
Yeah, the chairs are...

2261
02:42:58,200 --> 02:42:59,230
The chairs are evil.

2262
02:42:59,990 --> 02:43:01,930
What are you guys doing?

2263
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:10,560
I don't know where I just unleashed that upon.

2264
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:14,480
Let's try and bowl.

2265
02:43:16,380 --> 02:43:17,500
Let's try and bowl.

2266
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:19,120
I can't see anything, please.

2267
02:43:30,750 --> 02:43:31,270
Yes!

2268
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:40,740
He's dead depth.

2269
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:41,860
This guy is...

2270
02:43:42,140 --> 02:43:43,680
This guy has 9 lives.

2271
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:44,700
Almost a strike.

2272
02:43:45,260 --> 02:43:46,660
I know, we got a couple of them, right?

2273
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:52,800
Oh no, I'm trying to...

2274
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:54,120
Do the...

2275
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:54,960
Wait a minute.

2276
02:44:04,950 --> 02:44:05,870
Holy cow.

2277
02:44:07,530 --> 02:44:09,750
I have to get used to...

2278
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:12,770
Yay!

2279
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:21,100
I'm trying to explain my thoughts.

2280
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:21,440
Hold on.

2281
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:23,040
I don't know what the combo is called.

2282
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:34,480
The one...

2283
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:41,920
This one.

2284
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:44,700
This one.

2285
02:44:48,530 --> 02:44:51,550
Sometimes, like when the camera angle changes...

2286
02:44:52,310 --> 02:44:57,670
I can't tell if it's like hold back on the L...

2287
02:44:57,670 --> 02:45:00,990
Depending on where I'm facing or where the camera is.

2288
02:45:03,810 --> 02:45:04,930
Oh, you need to lock...

2289
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:06,350
I keep forgetting to lock.

2290
02:45:08,970 --> 02:45:10,890
My brain is not it today.

2291
02:45:10,990 --> 02:45:11,510
Sorry guys.

2292
02:45:12,350 --> 02:45:14,690
I only got like a little bit of sleep.

2293
02:45:17,130 --> 02:45:17,570
Sorry.

2294
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:22,820
Oh wait.

2295
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:28,140
Okay, so now that we have that one, how do we get this one?

2296
02:45:33,740 --> 02:45:35,060
Do I go in here?

2297
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:38,300
No, this leads back...

2298
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:40,980
Brain not brainin'.

2299
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:44,300
It's where the character is facing.

2300
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:46,360
Which I have trouble with too, no worries.

2301
02:45:47,140 --> 02:45:48,980
I'm glad that you can relate then.

2302
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:53,520
But this game is already feeling...

2303
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:54,300
I mean...

2304
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:57,300
I have yet to die, so...

2305
02:45:58,060 --> 02:46:00,580
This game is already a massive...

2306
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:03,660
Massive...

2307
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:06,300
I don't want to say improvement, but...

2308
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:11,280
It is so much kinder.

2309
02:46:17,580 --> 02:46:18,720
A relief.

2310
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:20,980
Truly.

2311
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:24,500
And I'm having so much fun with it.

2312
02:46:26,020 --> 02:46:27,040
Where do I go?

2313
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:29,880
Is it where we came from?

2314
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,580
If anybody knows, can I get a hint?

2315
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:41,860
This is the fireball room.

2316
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:51,260
I already have one.

2317
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:51,660
This one?

2318
02:46:52,940 --> 02:46:54,160
Oh, I can just let him...

2319
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:55,740
Oh, I thought he was stuck there.

2320
02:46:57,060 --> 02:46:57,980
Okay, just kidding.

2321
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:09,140
Oh...

2322
02:47:09,140 --> 02:47:10,220
Okay.

2323
02:47:10,860 --> 02:47:13,060
That makes things a whole lot easier.

2324
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:25,120
There we go.

2325
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:29,140
What did I release?

2326
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:29,200
Nice.

2327
02:47:40,370 --> 02:47:43,430
I like how this is probably the intended way...

2328
02:47:43,430 --> 02:47:44,990
To get rid of these guys in this moment.

2329
02:47:47,850 --> 02:47:49,430
This is so awesome.

2330
02:47:53,610 --> 02:47:54,930
Triple strike, baby!

2331
02:47:55,650 --> 02:47:56,410
Where did it go?

2332
02:47:57,310 --> 02:47:58,070
Oh, there it is.

2333
02:48:02,010 --> 02:48:02,690
Hello?

2334
02:48:03,110 --> 02:48:03,450
Hello?

2335
02:48:04,970 --> 02:48:05,650
Hello?

2336
02:48:06,990 --> 02:48:08,370
There we go.

2337
02:48:08,710 --> 02:48:10,130
Alright, let's go get the other one.

2338
02:48:11,870 --> 02:48:12,650
A turkey?

2339
02:48:14,910 --> 02:48:16,310
Is that where the triple strike is?

2340
02:48:16,670 --> 02:48:17,130
Maybe?

2341
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:22,230
One space remains...

2342
02:48:22,230 --> 02:48:22,950
And we got it.

2343
02:48:23,870 --> 02:48:24,850
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

2344
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:28,450
Babe load.

2345
02:48:30,010 --> 02:48:30,690
Go!

2346
02:48:40,370 --> 02:48:41,230
What did I...

2347
02:48:41,230 --> 02:48:42,010
What did it just break?

2348
02:48:42,190 --> 02:48:42,650
I heard...

2349
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:43,470
I heard crashing.

2350
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:51,660
I can't believe...

2351
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:54,580
It's so crazy that Beyblade has kind of made like a comeback.

2352
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:56,200
Have you guys noticed that too?

2353
02:48:57,340 --> 02:48:58,500
The Beyblade comeback?

2354
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:02,380
Oh, too much power.

2355
02:49:02,620 --> 02:49:03,240
Too much power.

2356
02:49:08,830 --> 02:49:09,890
It's fun though.

2357
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:12,890
Yippee!

2358
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:16,250
We did it!

2359
02:49:19,470 --> 02:49:20,470
Golly.

2360
02:49:21,630 --> 02:49:22,670
What else can I buy?

2361
02:49:24,430 --> 02:49:25,430
Not even close.

2362
02:49:26,450 --> 02:49:27,650
I'll buy holy water.

2363
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:44,120
Metal gear?

2364
02:49:45,980 --> 02:49:47,480
Get the photo camera ready.

2365
02:49:56,470 --> 02:49:57,730
Little fairies.

2366
02:49:58,970 --> 02:50:00,310
Oh my god.

2367
02:50:00,510 --> 02:50:01,370
They're making out.

2368
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:02,150
Oh, just kidding.

2369
02:50:02,490 --> 02:50:03,030
Oh, yes they are.

2370
02:50:03,410 --> 02:50:03,890
Oh my god.

2371
02:50:04,390 --> 02:50:05,210
Holy show.

2372
02:50:16,360 --> 02:50:17,600
They're so hot.

2373
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:23,260
I was enjoying the show.

2374
02:50:24,380 --> 02:50:25,220
How can I grab you?

2375
02:50:29,670 --> 02:50:30,210
Slapdunk!

2376
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:35,200
Can I grab you?

2377
02:50:43,300 --> 02:50:46,100
Still hot!

2378
02:50:48,900 --> 02:50:49,600
Nevermind.

2379
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,160
Yeah.

2380
02:51:05,380 --> 02:51:07,400
Say it, don't spray it buddy.

2381
02:51:11,560 --> 02:51:12,780
Oh my god.

2382
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:17,420
Can I grab you?

2383
02:51:18,100 --> 02:51:19,380
I'm gonna try and grab him.

2384
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:21,840
Oh, damn.

2385
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:29,570
Can I grab him?

2386
02:51:32,470 --> 02:51:34,190
I can grab when he's stunned.

2387
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:40,320
No!

2388
02:51:45,070 --> 02:51:46,570
Is this stunned or...

2389
02:51:46,570 --> 02:51:47,530
Do I need to stun him?

2390
02:52:00,620 --> 02:52:01,800
Oh, it's the hot ladies.

2391
02:52:02,360 --> 02:52:02,660
Again?

2392
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:03,720
Just kidding.

2393
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:04,160
No?

2394
02:52:04,700 --> 02:52:05,580
Oh, yes they are.

2395
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:10,940
Can I grab you?

2396
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:11,880
Can I grab you?

2397
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:13,000
Can I grab you?

2398
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:19,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2399
02:52:20,380 --> 02:52:22,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2400
02:52:24,480 --> 02:52:25,300
Did I get eaten?

2401
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:27,180
I think I'm getting eaten.

2402
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:30,640
I can just hear him going like...

2403
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:31,380
Ouch, ouch.

2404
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:35,500
Where did he go?

2405
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:38,100
Oh, hot ladies again.

2406
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:54,370
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die in here.

2407
02:53:02,610 --> 02:53:04,010
Oh my god.

2408
02:53:05,270 --> 02:53:07,130
I don't want to get caught by you.

2409
02:53:07,650 --> 02:53:10,170
It's so bad if I do...

2410
02:53:10,170 --> 02:53:11,250
Attack them fast.

2411
02:53:11,910 --> 02:53:12,650
These guys?

2412
02:53:13,230 --> 02:53:14,110
Where did they go?

2413
02:53:28,510 --> 02:53:28,790
Okay.

2414
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:45,570
Wait, is he stunned?

2415
02:53:45,750 --> 02:53:45,930
No.

2416
02:53:49,650 --> 02:53:51,130
Oh my god, I jumped.

2417
02:53:51,170 --> 02:53:52,330
I jumped but too late.

2418
02:53:52,550 --> 02:53:53,110
That sucks.

2419
02:53:53,690 --> 02:53:54,330
You guys!

2420
02:53:59,330 --> 02:54:01,910
I'm like doing so little damage to him though.

2421
02:54:04,130 --> 02:54:04,910
Not a lot at all.

2422
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:15,250
I think I'm not gonna make it.

2423
02:54:15,910 --> 02:54:16,990
I think I'm not gonna make it.

2424
02:54:33,670 --> 02:54:35,590
I gotta be a little bit more aggressive.

2425
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:39,910
I gotta be a little bit more aggressive.

2426
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:47,880
No bad touch.

2427
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,440
I will die, I will die.

2428
02:54:51,760 --> 02:54:52,440
It will be the end of me.

2429
02:54:59,260 --> 02:54:59,500
Damn.

2430
02:55:15,690 --> 02:55:16,490
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2431
02:55:16,710 --> 02:55:17,570
Oh, I'm gonna die.

2432
02:55:18,390 --> 02:55:19,190
I'm gonna die.

2433
02:55:19,550 --> 02:55:20,630
I'm gonna die for real.

2434
02:55:21,130 --> 02:55:21,550
It's okay.

2435
02:55:22,130 --> 02:55:22,530
It's okay.

2436
02:55:24,530 --> 02:55:25,390
I'm okay for sure.

2437
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:40,220
What do you guys think?

2438
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:41,780
Do I waste the gorb?

2439
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:46,400
We could gorb.

2440
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:47,180
Why not use it?

2441
02:56:02,570 --> 02:56:03,730
Is this it?

2442
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:06,330
Oh, wait.

2443
02:56:10,050 --> 02:56:11,330
Holy shit.

2444
02:56:14,010 --> 02:56:15,330
I didn't get a single...

2445
02:56:17,910 --> 02:56:19,010
We got him!

2446
02:56:19,330 --> 02:56:20,250
We got him boys.

2447
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:27,940
We got him.

2448
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:31,680
Yeah!

2449
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:33,700
That was crazy.

2450
02:56:34,520 --> 02:56:35,500
Oh my god, her toes.

2451
02:56:36,380 --> 02:56:37,800
No, her toes.

2452
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:44,120
That's exactly what I think.

2453
02:56:44,340 --> 02:56:44,980
Oh yeah!

2454
02:56:49,700 --> 02:56:51,660
We absorbed the sexy lady.

2455
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:54,160
She's always a part of us.

2456
02:56:55,300 --> 02:56:56,020
Baby!

2457
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:56,200
Baby!

2458
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:05,800
Brothers.

2459
02:57:08,620 --> 02:57:10,340
Did he just say brothers?

2460
02:57:11,720 --> 02:57:12,360
No.

2461
02:57:14,980 --> 02:57:16,040
No.

2462
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:20,520
Oh.

2463
02:57:31,140 --> 02:57:31,720
Yeah!

2464
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:33,040
I was gonna say...

2465
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:37,260
I was gonna...

2466
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:39,980
I was gonna say...

2467
02:57:39,980 --> 02:57:41,180
Round 2 I guess.

2468
02:57:41,820 --> 02:57:45,020
Part of the dangler feeler used by the demon bale.

2469
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:45,780
Bales?

2470
02:57:46,380 --> 02:57:49,500
Those who take it up will find a new source of power.

2471
02:57:50,060 --> 02:57:50,780
How do you say that?

2472
02:57:50,960 --> 02:57:52,520
Is that a V?

2473
02:57:54,580 --> 02:57:55,740
Rusalka corpse?

2474
02:58:02,330 --> 02:58:02,870
Witnessed.

2475
02:58:07,550 --> 02:58:09,270
All the robs.

2476
02:58:09,970 --> 02:58:11,350
So we closed this up.

2477
02:58:11,730 --> 02:58:12,270
Neat.

2478
02:58:14,490 --> 02:58:15,870
There's nothing else around here?

2479
02:58:16,030 --> 02:58:17,230
Alright, let's get out of here.

2480
02:58:19,550 --> 02:58:20,810
Let's get out of here.

2481
02:58:21,470 --> 02:58:23,110
Did something open up and I missed it?

2482
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:24,630
Yes indeed.

2483
02:58:31,030 --> 02:58:31,570
Yippee!

2484
02:58:33,890 --> 02:58:34,710
S!

2485
02:58:34,970 --> 02:58:36,350
Stylish points!

2486
02:58:37,470 --> 02:58:38,010
S!

2487
02:58:38,370 --> 02:58:39,090
S!

2488
02:58:39,230 --> 02:58:40,450
Stylish points!

2489
02:58:42,850 --> 02:58:43,430
Wow!

2490
02:58:44,430 --> 02:58:45,270
Wow!

2491
02:58:52,750 --> 02:58:55,250
What time is it?

2492
02:58:55,830 --> 02:58:58,630
Oh, I guess I should call it here.

2493
02:59:02,030 --> 02:59:02,490
Um...

2494
02:59:02,970 --> 02:59:04,210
One hour until map shift.

2495
02:59:04,290 --> 02:59:04,510
Yeah!

2496
02:59:04,810 --> 02:59:05,910
I just noticed too.

2497
02:59:06,950 --> 02:59:08,250
One hour warning.

2498
02:59:10,110 --> 02:59:10,570
Dang!

2499
02:59:13,070 --> 02:59:15,190
I mean, I could maybe do one more.

2500
02:59:15,310 --> 02:59:17,030
But I do wanna eat too.

2501
02:59:18,870 --> 02:59:19,290
Okay.

2502
02:59:19,730 --> 02:59:20,410
Let's call it here.

2503
02:59:20,510 --> 02:59:21,050
A bit of a short...

2504
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:24,850
Just a warm up of DMC4.

2505
02:59:25,070 --> 02:59:26,770
A little introduction.

2506
02:59:28,730 --> 02:59:29,410
Let's see.

2507
02:59:29,550 --> 02:59:30,870
How many missions did we get through?

2508
02:59:31,070 --> 02:59:31,630
Not very many.

2509
02:59:31,750 --> 02:59:32,630
I think like four?

2510
02:59:34,090 --> 02:59:35,330
Yeah, we're on five.

2511
02:59:35,550 --> 02:59:35,850
Okay.

2512
02:59:38,010 --> 02:59:38,930
Yeah, yeah.

2513
02:59:40,250 --> 02:59:41,370
How are you liking Nero?

2514
02:59:42,010 --> 02:59:42,790
I just...

2515
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:44,250
I don't dislike him.

2516
02:59:44,530 --> 02:59:48,630
He's basically Dante Jr. But...

2517
02:59:48,630 --> 02:59:50,390
I do like the grabby grab.

2518
02:59:51,390 --> 02:59:52,950
I like that a lot actually.

2519
02:59:53,010 --> 02:59:53,990
I think that's a lot of fun.

2520
02:59:56,330 --> 02:59:56,850
And...

2521
02:59:56,850 --> 02:59:58,790
Wait, we're a fourth of the way through?

2522
02:59:59,470 --> 03:00:00,330
No way.

2523
03:00:02,030 --> 03:00:02,950
Hi from Taiwan.

2524
03:00:03,190 --> 03:00:03,450
Hello!

2525
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:06,450
I hope you're having a good time too.

2526
03:00:09,370 --> 03:00:10,710
She's got that punk attitude.

2527
03:00:11,310 --> 03:00:12,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2528
03:00:12,890 --> 03:00:14,070
It's very unique gameplay.

2529
03:00:14,150 --> 03:00:15,350
There's a lot that...

2530
03:00:15,350 --> 03:00:17,230
You know, I see some people in the chat saying like...

2531
03:00:17,230 --> 03:00:18,830
Oh, I never really used the rev.

2532
03:00:19,230 --> 03:00:20,290
And things like that.

2533
03:00:21,510 --> 03:00:21,950
So...

2534
03:00:21,950 --> 03:00:28,010
I definitely will have to fall into my own sort of gameplay style.

2535
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:30,010
But so far...

2536
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:32,390
I mean...

2537
03:00:32,390 --> 03:00:33,410
After...

2538
03:00:33,410 --> 03:00:34,730
Three was so...

2539
03:00:34,730 --> 03:00:36,450
Three was so difficult.

2540
03:00:36,730 --> 03:00:38,970
And I have not unlocked easy mode!

2541
03:00:40,310 --> 03:00:41,410
Aren't you guys proud of me?

2542
03:00:46,880 --> 03:00:48,240
Aren't you guys proud of me?

2543
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:49,940
I didn't get the easy mode.

2544
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:50,780
It's now unlocked.

2545
03:00:54,800 --> 03:00:55,320
Yeah.

2546
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:02,480
Oh yeah, it was unlocked from the beginning.

2547
03:01:02,720 --> 03:01:03,980
It was the human mode, wasn't it?

2548
03:01:06,060 --> 03:01:06,580
Well...

2549
03:01:06,580 --> 03:01:07,200
Whatever!

2550
03:01:08,900 --> 03:01:09,420
I

2551
03:01:16,070 --> 03:01:17,330
didn't have to use it.

2552
03:01:20,270 --> 03:01:22,790
Definitely can see where they made improvements though.

2553
03:01:25,070 --> 03:01:26,110
From the...

2554
03:01:26,110 --> 03:01:27,030
From one and three.

2555
03:01:27,030 --> 03:01:27,910
Obviously three.

2556
03:01:28,070 --> 03:01:29,050
You can see that too.

2557
03:01:29,130 --> 03:01:30,490
But three is so tricky also.

2558
03:01:32,130 --> 03:01:33,010
I'm curious though.

2559
03:01:33,150 --> 03:01:34,190
With the boss that we just did.

2560
03:01:34,270 --> 03:01:37,130
I kind of want to see what new powers we have.

2561
03:01:37,390 --> 03:01:40,130
That was one of my favorite things about three.

2562
03:01:40,290 --> 03:01:42,470
Was being able to switch between all the different weapons.

2563
03:01:43,310 --> 03:01:44,110
I like...

2564
03:01:44,110 --> 03:01:45,350
I thought that was a lot of fun.

2565
03:01:46,390 --> 03:01:46,790
So...

2566
03:01:46,790 --> 03:01:48,950
Smosh has this character called the Chosen.

2567
03:01:49,070 --> 03:01:51,190
Basically a weeb that thinks he's better than everybody.

2568
03:01:51,650 --> 03:01:53,470
I always think of him when playing Vergil.

2569
03:01:54,110 --> 03:01:55,770
He hosted a Beyblade tournament.

2570
03:01:55,770 --> 03:01:56,430
Oh!

2571
03:01:57,490 --> 03:01:58,670
Who's Smosh?

2572
03:02:06,650 --> 03:02:08,970
Weapon switching essential to the series after three.

2573
03:02:09,050 --> 03:02:11,910
Wait, so do we also then get that too?

2574
03:02:15,770 --> 03:02:17,210
YouTube comedy channel.

2575
03:02:17,730 --> 03:02:18,190
Oh!

2576
03:02:18,650 --> 03:02:18,990
That!

2577
03:02:19,230 --> 03:02:19,570
Oh!

2578
03:02:20,810 --> 03:02:21,490
I...

2579
03:02:24,610 --> 03:02:26,670
I never watched them.

2580
03:02:29,230 --> 03:02:30,550
I never watched them.

2581
03:02:32,390 --> 03:02:34,070
It's a lot for you to discover about this game.

2582
03:02:34,130 --> 03:02:34,830
I could tell!

2583
03:02:35,630 --> 03:02:38,750
But that's always one of the fun things about these types of games.

2584
03:02:39,130 --> 03:02:40,930
I'm sorry to bring up Metal Gear again, but I will.

2585
03:02:41,310 --> 03:02:46,370
But everybody can play the game in the way that they wish to play the game.

2586
03:02:47,050 --> 03:02:49,230
So there's no right way.

2587
03:02:49,810 --> 03:02:52,490
Or I guess there is technically a wrong way.

2588
03:02:52,630 --> 03:02:54,230
But you know, same with Metal Gear.

2589
03:02:54,310 --> 03:02:56,390
You can be as stealthy or as crazy as you want.

2590
03:02:57,810 --> 03:02:59,090
And that's fun.

2591
03:02:59,970 --> 03:03:01,090
That's fun!

2592
03:03:02,010 --> 03:03:03,470
Love self-expression in games.

2593
03:03:03,550 --> 03:03:03,850
Yeah!

2594
03:03:07,270 --> 03:03:08,350
Metal Gear Revenge?

2595
03:03:10,990 --> 03:03:12,670
I do not feel that she is sorry.

2596
03:03:12,970 --> 03:03:14,370
I'm never sorry for bringing up Metal Gear.

2597
03:03:14,710 --> 03:03:15,610
It's all that I know.

2598
03:03:15,970 --> 03:03:16,970
I've only played one game.

2599
03:03:17,410 --> 03:03:17,770
Metal Gear.

2600
03:03:23,230 --> 03:03:28,150
The legendary Dark Knight mode is crazy because it summons three times the mobs.

2601
03:03:28,150 --> 03:03:33,850
I was just thinking honestly though that there doesn't seem to be so many mobs spawning.

2602
03:03:34,570 --> 03:03:37,050
I think three has really leveled me up as a gamer.

2603
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:40,370
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted!

2604
03:03:41,330 --> 03:03:42,470
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2605
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:44,610
I think so.

2606
03:03:49,090 --> 03:03:50,810
Wait, that did save, right?

2607
03:03:51,030 --> 03:03:51,510
Oh shoot.

2608
03:03:52,210 --> 03:03:53,310
I just realized.

2609
03:03:54,690 --> 03:03:56,070
That did save.

2610
03:03:56,410 --> 03:03:57,550
It said load.

2611
03:03:57,550 --> 03:03:58,350
OK, we're fine.

2612
03:04:02,010 --> 03:04:05,190
Tomorrow, Rafi!

2613
03:04:06,470 --> 03:04:08,050
No games, only Metal Gear.

2614
03:04:08,710 --> 03:04:09,550
I don't know.

2615
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:11,830
I am streaming tomorrow.

2616
03:04:12,490 --> 03:04:14,290
Do you want me to sing tomorrow for you?

2617
03:04:14,450 --> 03:04:15,590
You don't have to remind me though.

2618
03:04:15,730 --> 03:04:16,750
I'll just sing today just in case.

2619
03:04:16,870 --> 03:04:17,470
We'll pretend it's tomorrow.

2620
03:04:18,810 --> 03:04:21,530
Happy birthday to you.

2621
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:23,730
Happy birthday to you.

2622
03:04:24,690 --> 03:04:27,570
Happy birthday Rafi Raphael.

2623
03:04:28,450 --> 03:04:31,530
Happy birthday to you.

2624
03:04:33,090 --> 03:04:33,950
Happy birthday!

2625
03:04:35,450 --> 03:04:37,450
What console did this game come off...

2626
03:04:37,450 --> 03:04:38,890
Come...

2627
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:41,690
Released on?

2628
03:04:42,450 --> 03:04:43,590
PS2 or PS3?

2629
03:04:45,850 --> 03:04:46,670
PS3.

2630
03:04:46,970 --> 03:04:47,470
360.

2631
03:04:47,610 --> 03:04:48,410
OK, that's what I thought.

2632
03:04:51,190 --> 03:04:52,670
360 PS3.

2633
03:04:54,070 --> 03:04:56,150
Are you enjoying Peak DMC?

2634
03:04:56,270 --> 03:04:56,940
I am.

2635
03:04:58,870 --> 03:04:59,990
Game is so much fun.

2636
03:05:01,170 --> 03:05:03,390
Look, there's the Devil May Cry right there.

2637
03:05:05,150 --> 03:05:06,190
Will we go there?

2638
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:08,210
I want to go to there.

2639
03:05:09,470 --> 03:05:11,390
I finished my first MGS game, Snake Eater.

2640
03:05:11,750 --> 03:05:13,610
I hope you liked it.

2641
03:05:15,730 --> 03:05:18,050
This is the first multi-platform DMC.

2642
03:05:19,650 --> 03:05:21,970
I like how both of you said that at the same time.

2643
03:05:23,970 --> 03:05:24,390
3DS.

2644
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:26,770
Oh my gosh, imagine Devil May Cry on the 3DS.

2645
03:05:28,330 --> 03:05:29,170
Imagine.

2646
03:05:33,550 --> 03:05:35,830
My game just crashed.

2647
03:05:40,210 --> 03:05:41,610
Well, I think...

2648
03:05:41,610 --> 03:05:43,590
I think my computer is kicking me out.

2649
03:05:44,050 --> 03:05:45,250
I didn't do anything.

2650
03:05:50,780 --> 03:05:53,540
Why did my game just crash?

2651
03:05:56,580 --> 03:05:58,260
OK, well...

2652
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:02,260
That was silly.

2653
03:06:02,640 --> 03:06:05,300
Oh, and we got to beat the first boss.

2654
03:06:05,420 --> 03:06:06,360
So that's fun too.

2655
03:06:06,780 --> 03:06:09,640
I think this is a good stopping point, honestly.

2656
03:06:11,320 --> 03:06:11,860
Tsumito!

2657
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:12,440
Tsumito!

2658
03:06:12,580 --> 03:06:13,020
Tsumito!

2659
03:06:13,600 --> 03:06:16,060
If you are a member...

2660
03:06:16,060 --> 03:06:17,780
If you are a part of membership...

2661
03:06:19,480 --> 03:06:22,720
In 50 minutes, we'll be doing a stream.

2662
03:06:24,380 --> 03:06:26,780
And if you're watching the VOD...

2663
03:06:26,780 --> 03:06:28,460
Thank you for watching the VOD.

2664
03:06:28,460 --> 03:06:30,900
And thanks for watching all the way until now.

2665
03:06:32,200 --> 03:06:32,640
And...

2666
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:38,040
If you are a VOD member, you can watch that.

2667
03:06:38,940 --> 03:06:41,520
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

2668
03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:42,680
You guys have gone insane.

2669
03:06:42,720 --> 03:06:43,260
Are you crazy?

2670
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:45,180
Paperbacks, thank you for the 5 gifted.

2671
03:06:46,280 --> 03:06:47,560
Jared, welcome to membership.

2672
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:48,460
Thank you!

2673
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:51,060
I hope you guys had a good weekend.

2674
03:06:52,560 --> 03:06:54,640
And we'll finish off the weekend together.

2675
03:06:55,360 --> 03:06:55,800
If you want.

2676
03:06:56,480 --> 03:06:57,660
It's not like I want you there or anything.

2677
03:06:58,460 --> 03:07:00,680
It's not like you have, you know...

2678
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:01,460
It's not like...

2679
03:07:02,260 --> 03:07:03,540
OK, anyway, bye!

2680
03:07:43,100 --> 03:07:45,700
If you, you know, would be kind of cool.

2681
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:47,340
You know.

2682
03:07:48,800 --> 03:07:49,300
I

2683
03:07:54,890 --> 03:07:55,190
don't know.

2684
03:07:55,430 --> 03:07:55,990
I'm just saying.

2685
03:07:57,190 --> 03:07:57,690
Just...
