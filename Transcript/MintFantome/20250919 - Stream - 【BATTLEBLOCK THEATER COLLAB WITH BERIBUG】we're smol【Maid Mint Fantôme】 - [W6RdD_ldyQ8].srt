1
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,010
Hello!

2
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,670
Hello!

3
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,460
Blah!

4
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,240
Blah!

5
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,680
You want to give a blah?

6
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Uh...

7
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,140
Blah!

8
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,340
Hi everybody, welcome to a very beautiful Friday.

9
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,600
Happy Friday.

10
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,620
TGIF!

11
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,060
TGIF.

12
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,040
We're playing a game from 2013.

13
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,920
It's It's older than Metal Gear Solid 5.

14
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah.

15
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,560
That's why we played it, because this is a Metal Gear Solid 5 reference.

16
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,380
Is it?

17
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
Yeah, because this is during when Snake was sleeping.

18
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, yeah.

19
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,460
It's been nine years.

20
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,300
This is what, like, Kai's was developing.

21
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,080
He was gaming.

22
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,760
He was fucking gaming.

23
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,620
He was gaming.

24
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,260
Do you think Love Bloom's on the BattleBlock Theater?

25
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,620
Oh, yeah.

26
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,920
Actually, I know nothing about this game, Barry.

27
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,760
Oh, wait.

28
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,380
You should give an introduction.

29
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,460
Oh, okay.

30
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,920
Hi, everybody.

31
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,900
My name is Barry, and I'm a bug.

32
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,660
I'm a ladybug to be ex...

33
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,160
Oh.

34
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,270
Continue.

35
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,550
I have a...

36
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,510
Ladybug to be exact.

37
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,690
What the fuck?

38
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,810
Why would you say that?

39
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,190
It's fine.

40
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,430
It's just, you know.

41
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,690
I'm actually afraid of ladybugs a little bit.

42
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,110
Have I ever told you that?

43
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,810
No, you haven't.

44
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,510
You even let me into your bed.

45
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,390
Yeah, Barry and I have shared a bed before.

46
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,290
To you.

47
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,190
That's not all we've done.

48
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,090
What else have we done?

49
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,410
We've shared a Denny's pancake.

50
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,700
It was good, though, that Denny's pancake.

51
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,700
I definitely didn't give Barry...

52
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,800
I definitely couldn't finish...

53
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,360
Or, no, I definitely did not...

54
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,540
Wait, how the...

55
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:58,940
Hold on.

56
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,080
It's definitely not that I couldn't finish it and give Barry my leftovers.

57
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,040
Yeah, I just happened to come at the end and everyone was like...

58
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,900
Everyone was like, yeah, just eat leftovers.

59
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
I was just...

60
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,800
Everyone gave me their leftovers.

61
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,040
Like, Barry, are you hungry?

62
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,020
You have pancakes.

63
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,140
Barry, are you hungry?

64
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,940
You have...

65
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,160
What else was there?

66
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
I love mooching.

67
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,500
I think I ate, like, someone's bacon.

68
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,620
Yeah.

69
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,500
Yeah, I think Maddie offered me her bacon or something.

70
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,700
Yeah.

71
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,260
And then...

72
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,400
We hung out a couple times.

73
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,260
We even went to Knott's Berry Farm.

74
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,820
Yeah!

75
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,300
Yeah!

76
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,640
And we went on that one roller coaster where you lie down when you're looking at each.

77
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,840
Wait, we were also next to each other on the pony ride.

78
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,140
Yeah, we were doing umapyoi.

79
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,580
We were like umapyoi, umapyoi.

80
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,380
We were front row, baby.

81
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,740
And yeah.

82
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,060
The seats like strapped us in.

83
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,860
It was crazy.

84
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,400
It made us have like a very sexy pose.

85
00:10:11,420 --> 00:11:30,080
because it like accentuated your your butt so basically the ride you're riding a pony like that's how the seat is and then there's also like a back part that like pushes you your it pushes you against the seat too and so your butt's sticking out and you're like i'm i'm riding this pony this is sexually i want to be a cowboy baby baby what did they say save a horse ride a cow boy do they say that i think so whoa that's crazy yo who is they it's they they the people yeah them the guys yeah everybody says that wait it's a song lyric oh oh i didn't know that i didn't know for thank you for all the support everybody and all the donations uh we'll probably i think minto might do it after uh or like after the collab too but i'll do everything after the collab yeah um yeah focus all my all my uh attention on the minto

86
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,000

88
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,020
It's true!

89
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm so innocent.

90
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,060
Don't I look innocent?

91
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,700
Your face?

92
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,380
What about my face?

93
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,240
Basically, we're like, Don't I look innocent?

94
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
I'm innocent, man.

95
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,080
We're so innocent together.

96
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,800
Yeah.

97
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,960
We're so innocent together.

98
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,360
Yeah.

99
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,060
This is the most innocent collab.

100
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,060
Yeah.

101
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,380
Wait, what's L buttons?

Oh.

104
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,900
Yeah, we can change our colors.

105
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,980
Oh my goodness.

106
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,820
Oh my goodness.

00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,060

Hey.

110
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,040
What are we gonna do?

111
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,540
I'm gonna close my eyes and then I'll pick a color.

112
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,780
Okay, okay, okay.

113
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,380
This one!

114
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,060
Mid-fan pole.

115
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,600
It's you!

116
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,920
Why you like me!

117
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,740
Yeah!

118
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,620
You like me!

119
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,640
I was thinking we could do green because I have green in my thing and you're minto.

120
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
Okay, we could do green.

121
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,020
Yeah.

122
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,460
Alright, ready up.

123
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,340
How do I read it?

124
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm ready.

125
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,980
Just kidding.

126
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,400
I've never played this game before, you guys.

127
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,360
This is a new experience for me.

128
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,080
Yeah, you don't know anything about this game, right?

129
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,240
Literally nothing.

130
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,160
I'm just a triangle man.

131
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,640
Oh!

132
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,320
Shit!

133
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
Look at you, triangle.

134
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,940
Wait, I want the scarf.

135
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,400
Oh.

136
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,900
Oh, cute.

137
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,880
You like this one?

138
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,340
Yeah, I like that one.

139
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,860
There's like a bunch of faces.

140
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,680
I only played this for, like, a tiny bit.

141
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,860
So I have some faces unlocked.

142
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,180
Wait, you have so many.

143
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,560
What are you talking about?

144
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,700
Apparently, apparently you can also...

145
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,940
Okay, I didn't know this because I guess I did this like four years ago or something.

146
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,180
But I guess somebody gave me like a PNG to work with.

147
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,520
Do you see this?

148
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,420
No, it just has like...

149
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,920
It's you in a hood and then your face...

150
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
You look like...

151
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,140
You look like Squid Game.

152
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,680
So I guess if you upload your own PNG...

153
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:46,120
it like kind of doesn't Oh, I like the tongue That one is freaky Not that one I like the tongue You like that one Yeah The freaky one

Wait, you have the star!

157
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,580
Oh, wait, we both have the star.

158
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,160
Yeah, oh, wait, I just...

159
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,900
How did I unlock the castle crashers?

160
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,880
That's castle crashers, right?

161
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,940
Wait, I've unlocked some...

162
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah, I think it's just...

163
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,140
We'll see.

164
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,260
Oh, I went in...

165
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,940
Okay, I'm coming.

166
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,080
Are we prisoners?

167
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,100
Yeah, we're...

168
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,520
I...

169
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,540
Yeah, I think we are.

170
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,180
Wait, did it play the intro?

171
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,080
I don't...

172
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,760
Not crazy?

173
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,420
No, it didn't.

174
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,320
Uh-oh.

175
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,720
A trade by Hiding.

176
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,220
Maybe it'll play here.

177
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,440
It did not play the intro.

178
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,780
Does it usually play the intro?

179
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,340
You might have to host it.

180
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,680
Because I think I played this like 10 years ago somehow.

181
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,800
Oh, yeah.

182
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,880
Because it even is showing like all of these is complete, I think.

183
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,600
Okay, I think you might have to host my bad.

185
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,560
That's okay.

186
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,020
I'll just...

187
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,460
Wait, if I...

188
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,200
Reset level, maybe?

189
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,220
Yeah.

190
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,310
Reset level?

191
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,550
I think it's fine.

192
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,770
I don't know if we...

193
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,470
No, maybe?

194
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,590
Oh, wait.

195
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,790
How is this?

196
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:21,990
Did I do it?

197
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:23,750
No?

198
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,190
I didn't do it.

199
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,530
I think you might have to host.

200
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:27,730
Okay.

201
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,530
So there's like a story or...

202
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,470
Yeah, there's a story.

203
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,150
There's like a cute intro.

204
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:33,950
Oh.

205
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,450
Wait.

206
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,190
Oh, there we go.

207
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,810
Exit game.

208
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,810
Okay.

209
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:40,830
I...

210
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,390
Oh, I forgot to ask everybody.

211
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,150
How's the audio?

212
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,650
Oh, yeah.

213
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,490
Let us know if the audio is okay.

214
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,930
Yeah.

215
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,350
Okay.

216
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,530
Online.

217
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,950
And then I host.

218
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,850
I think the main voice actor from this game is a...

219
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,030
Stampy, I think.

220
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,210
I don't know if you know that name, but he was like a...

221
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,710
He's like a Newgrounds guy.

222
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,190
I don't really know any Newgrounds stuff, but...

223
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,490
Apparently, it was like a pretty big deal.

224
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,790
Stampy?

225
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,430
Stamper?

226
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,550
Stamper?

227
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,170
Stampy?

228
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,710
Someone like that?

229
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,050
Stamper?

230
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,110
Oh, Stamper?

231
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:18,490
Stamper?

232
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,510
My bad.

233
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,390
Wait, oh.

234
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,270
I don't want to... Oh, oh.

235
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,710
Oh, I have nothing.

236
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:27,990
Okay.

237
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,950
That's why I have nothing.

238
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:29,290
Okay.

239
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,410
Now let me... How do I invite you?

240
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,250
I still don't know how you stand.

241
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,870
Here, I can join your game.

242
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,330
There we go, there we go.

243
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,850
Oh, you joined?

244
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,550
Oh, I just, oh, I sent you an invite.

245
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,250
Okay, just kidding.

246
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,430
Okay, we're here anyway.

247
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,310
You're here, right here.

248
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,090
Yeah.

249
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,250
You doing that face.

250
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,110
Coggle ready.

251
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,550
Well, it's gone by me.

252
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,530
Here we go.

253
00:17:59,550 --> 00:17:59,910
Woo!

254
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,610
Woo-hoo.

255
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,610
Good evening, boys and girls, ladies, hmm, and gentlemen.

256
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,130
Turn the lights down, though.

257
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:17,750
Shut your faces as I wrap you in the cozy blanket of a story a story is heartwarming and soft as a mother's kiss or is it?

258
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,970
Once upon a time there was a boat now.

259
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,410
This wasn't just any boat children.

260
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,570
It was a ship a ship full of friends hundreds of hundreds of them Wow, I've never had them in it was get it?

261
00:18:29,570 --> 00:19:13,090
It wouldn't be very ladylike of me if I didn't mention the most noteworthy friend on board Hattie Hattie Hattie Hattie was like King friend friend to one and all oh where's his heart handsome gentlemen now one fine morning patty and pals set out for a new exciting adventure what fantastic wonders would they discover this time perhaps they'd come across yeah everyone say hi to haddy they'd find an island made entirely of candy perhaps they'd meet a band of scary swashbuckling pirates and join forces to find an island made entirely of candy oh so long as they were together there was smiles to be had an adventure Adventure Day spirits were on crushably high.

262
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:24,690
Everyone was singing and dancing and having a jolly time When the sun made the ocean was all like surprise and a huge massive storm blew it out of nowhere Was you was you was you something?

263
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,830
No, I was quick.

264
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,310
Oh my god And the wind boom Didn't like that.

265
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,330
It was over.

266
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,470
Is everyone okay?

267
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,210
Said Hattie.

268
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,590
I don't know what I'd do if I lost even one of you.

269
00:19:39,690 --> 00:20:43,470
I think we lost last one but the eye of the storm is very misleading children never turn your back on it because the ocean was all like psych and it came back even bigger this time twice as big would you show you as if Poseidon himself extended his hand in friendship and they they're having fun though look at them they're all yeah they're having fun they're all oh my god and the rain came down like a shower of bullets ah and the floorboards were and pieces of their ship were raining down like shards of broken dreams and then Reginald comes upstairs and he's like I say gentlemen I do believe we're in quite a spot of father and everyone else was like really what tips you off genius hey be nice huge giant waves thrash the boats to and fro they're not smiling anymore oh no we lost friends the friends everyone was screaming like was this huge whale like and made it super scary.

270
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,570
Oh my god, man on fire.

271
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,110
Man on fire.

272
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,410
Yep, there he is.

273
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:46,810
Oh god.

274
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,110
Who is that?

275
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,390
And then Hattie was our like, hold on to your butts.

276
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,650
Land ho and bang, bang, bang, smash.

277
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:54,990
A shipwreck.

278
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,590
Yes, foretold by their fate books of fate.

279
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:06,690
And while it seems like the end, this is merely the beginning of another fantastic journey for the brave crew of the SS Friendship.

280
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,470
Hell yeah.

281
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,170
Hell yeah.

282
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,290
Hell yeah.

283
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,590
There we go, this is the intro.

284
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,150
Ah!

285
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,170
Yeah.

286
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,110
Hello, look at my tongue.

287
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,530
Blah.

288
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,230
Blah.

289
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,390
Keep up.

290
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,250
Oh, look at the cat.

291
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,290
The cat?

292
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,870
Yeah, you're the cat.

293
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:31,610
Oh, what the?

294
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,690
The door.

295
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:33,790
Fuck you.

296
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,570
Ah, fuck you.

297
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,630
Dude.

298
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,410
What the heck?

299
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,730
Hey.

300
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,410
Hey.

301
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,090
Hey.

302
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,490
Hey!

303
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:40,810
Hey!

304
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:41,510
Hey!

305
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:41,990
Hey!

306
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:44,330
Ah!

307
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,590
How did you do that?

308
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,570
Oh my god!

309
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,530
Ow!

310
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,250
What the f- Oh, oh, shot.

311
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:55,810
Oh!

312
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,140
Ow!

313
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,960
Let's- Don't do it again.

314
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,100
Oh, ow!

315
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,140
What the- Ah!

316
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,170
Yeah, that's right.

317
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:12,430
Wait!

318
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,350
Uh-oh.

319
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,630
Ow!

320
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,530
Uh-oh.

321
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:14,790
Ah!

322
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,370
I'm sure how to...

323
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,350
Okay, so...

324
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,130
Maybe you could change it in the...

325
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,490
Oh, hey!

326
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

327
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:23,730
Yeah?

328
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,530
Oh, wait.

329
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,910
So we have different weapons.

330
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,530
That's fine.

331
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,730
You can change your weapon in the player select.

332
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,270
In the setup.

333
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,170
Where you change your face.

334
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,250
Oh, no, there's only one for me.

335
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:36,790
That's okay.

336
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,270
Oh.

337
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,750
Aw, Mei!

338
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,290
Aw, Mei!

339
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,770
Ha!

340
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,350
Oh, we're going to get tickets.

341
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,990
I guess I played this game before.

342
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,650
Oh, my God.

343
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,990
I think I played a good amount of this game before, maybe.

344
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:54,670
I think so, too.

345
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,090
Like, like, 10 years ago, maybe.

346
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,730
What the hell?

347
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,250
I don't remember anything about this, though.

348
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,210
You think that guy is...

349
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,350
Fine?

350
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:06,670
Yeah.

351
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,890
Oh, I didn't even...

352
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,210
I was looking at the cat in the background.

353
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,150
I think he's fine.

354
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,050
Okay.

355
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,190

Oh, you go on the lava block.

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:12,630

Oh, dang it.

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,710
There we go.

396
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,930
Oh, wow!

397
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:21,810

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:22,950
Okay.

Thank you.

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,170
Thank you.

401
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,210
Yeah, I would work for, I always work towards, uh, with my friends.

402
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,030
We work towards friendship.

403
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,250
Yeah, we work towards friendship.

404
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,410
Oh, watch out for the water.

405
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,250
Is that, so there's like secret things too that you get?

406
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

407
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,530
Like the yarn and stuff?

408
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,670
Oh, we're missing one.

411
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,330
Oh, there it is.

412
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,230
I got it.

413
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,050
Yeah.

414
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,810
That's it!

415
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,290
Woo!

416
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,790
We did it!

417
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,110
Easy.

418
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,890
Yeah, why was he hatty before getting the hat?

419
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,290
he was gonna be happy.

420
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,210
Maybe it was always meant to be.

421
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,650
Ah.

422
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,950
We're too good at this.

423
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,090
Well, we are.

424
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,790
This music.

425
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,330
Wait, how do we get up there?

426
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,550
Wait, let me throw you?

427
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,110
Throw me.

428
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:15,670
Okay.

429
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,410
Okay.

430
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,050
Okay.

431
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,470
Oh, no, wait.

432
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:19,870
No, wait.

433
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,230
Hold on.

434
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,970
Okay, throw me the other way.

435
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,650
Turn around?

436
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,210
No, no.

437
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:24,990
Oh, wait, hold on.

438
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,310
Okay.

439
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, there you go.

440
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:35,570
Okay.

441
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,730
Oh.

442
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,610
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

443
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,850
You can throw me.

444
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:40,850
I'll take it.

445
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:41,810
Wait, what is this?

446
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,330
That worked.

447
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,290
That was, that was the, I meant to do that.

448
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:45,830
Oh, okay.

449
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,490
Perfect.

450
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,930
Oh, why'd you do that?

451
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,030
Why'd you do that to me?

452
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,790
It was a mistake.

453
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,670
It was a mistake.

454
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,730
Oh, wait.

455
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,370
You gotta go down.

456
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,710
You got this?

457
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,890
You got this?

458
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,170
You got this?

459
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,730
You got this?

460
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,390
You got this?

461
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,570
Thank you.

462
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,060
Easy.

463
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,420
It was so easy.

464
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,060
I didn't know why you couldn't do it.

465
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:20,840
I would.

466
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,480
Wait.

467
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,160
Oh, there's something over there.

468
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,700
You're right.

469
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,360
Oh, I need you.

470
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,560
Yeah, you do.

471
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,480
What does that mean?

472
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,580
Oh, oh.

473
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,540
Wait, hold on.

474
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,540
I have to wait.

475
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,440
Here, I'll be set up.

476
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,420
Okay.

477
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,400
I'm set up.

478
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,480
That was so easy.

479
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,220
No, I didn't die at all.

480
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
I don't think so.

481
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,000
As long as one of us is alive.

482
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,460
Yeah, I think...

483
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,420
Wait, but we...

484
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,840
We've just died together, so I guess it's fine.

485
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,520
Yeah, I think it's mostly a time thing, maybe.

486
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,140
Oh, okay.

487
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,940
Oh!

488
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,140
Thank you.

489
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,700
Yeah, I just wanted us to get the gem.

490
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,920
Yeah, of course.

491
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,280
Wait, how do I...

492
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,720
Yeah, yeah.

493
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,840
Okay.

494
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,540
Is there something...

495
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:26,760
Oh.

496
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
What the heck was that?

497
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,140
No, you can go.

498
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,020
Oh, it's...

499
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,480
No, nothing.

500
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,000
No, no.

501
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,340
Nothing.

502
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,020
No, nothing.

503
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,800
I love...

504
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,390
Let me go to the right, maybe.

505
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,410
Maybe down.

506
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:45,530
Mm.

507
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,230
Okay, let's bring it up.

508
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,770
Yeah, you try.

509
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,790
Oh, oh, shit!

510
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,030
Ah!

511
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,250
Wait, he's freaky.

512
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,510
He sees your tongue.

513
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,510
He sees your tongue.

514
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,730
He thinks I'm one of them.

515
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,950
Are you?

516
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,890
You do know there's an eight plus, right?

517
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,190
No.

518
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,670
There's no tongue toggle on them.

519
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,890
There is none.

520
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,690
No one will ever...

521
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:14,790
No one will ever...

522
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:14,810
Yeah.

523
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,370
Oh, you see, you actually made it easier.

524
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,270
Oh!

525
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,310
Hey, wait a minute.

526
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,110
You got the gem!

527
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:26,790
Good job!

528
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,790
What the heck?

529
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,250
I can't...

530
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,040
Stay.

531
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,260
Stop dead.

532
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:37,760
She's dead.

533
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,340
She's beating my ass!

534
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,320
She's beating my ass!

535
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,200
Oh!

536
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,220
Oh!

537
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,960
What's this?

538
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,820
Oh my god.

539
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,820
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

540
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,760
I smacked him down.

541
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,520
I smacked him.

542
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,140
Okay, okay.

543
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,140
Ah, ah, ah!

544
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,460
Yeah, kill that guy.

545
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,420
Yeah, punch him.

546
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,080
Kill him, kill him.

547
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,680
Kill that guy.

548
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,080
Oh.

549
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,380
Yeah, kill that guy.

550
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,560
Oh, you can actually drown him.

551
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,160
Okay, nice.

552
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,260
Yeah.

553
00:30:59,420 --> 00:30:59,840
Oh, wait.

554
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,100
Wait, how am I supposed to get this?

555
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't think you can go through cloud blocks.

556
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:03,940
You gotta go.

557
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,380

00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,460
Did I take both of them?

562
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:10,960
Yeah.

563
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,380

Go get it.

572
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,000
I didn't try to do anything.

573
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,540
Come here.

574
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,560

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,780
Come here.

576
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,320
Thank you.

577
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,160
I didn't mean to do that.

578
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,160
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,120
I have trust issues, but Maybe I can trust Minko.

580
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,080
You can trust.

581
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,060
Maybe I can trust...

582
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,920
Oh, he's so cute!

583
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,180
Oh, he's like, hey, he's just...

584
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,460
We just murdered him.

585
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,380
No, that was your fault, though.

586
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,960
No, what is this?

587
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,260
A boat!

588
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,380

Oh, wait.

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,420
We need 10 gems, though.

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,040
Oh, we have 10.

602
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,140
No, I'm different.

603
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,500
I don't think my luck was very good.

604
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,560
I didn't have to use that one.

605
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,640
I do?

606
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,600
You got it, so you have to, right?

607
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
It's like your first SSR in the game.

608
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,740
Right.

609
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,900
Wait, what's a concession device?

610
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,760
It's like basically, I think it's just the heads, like the different heads, but, um...

611
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,200
Oh.

612
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,180
Like if you look, this is like the triangle head.

613
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,160
Oh, that's a triangle one.

00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,500
Oh, whoa, whoa.

You have five?

621
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,160
I don't think we have five yet.

622
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,740
I have five.

623
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,360
I have seven.

624
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:26,740
Oh!

625
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,740

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,500
Do you want this one?

631
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,880
No, I'll keep mine.

632
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll keep it.

633
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,900
It's fine.

634
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,420
Okay.

635
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,280

636
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,220

637
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,120
I don't know how to...

638
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,280
Wait, do I switch in their player setup?

639
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,680
Oh, there we go.

640
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,020
Okay, are you ready for this?

641
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,760
You're gonna have to stare at it the rest of the game.

642
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,160
What?

643
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,740
What am I looking at?

644
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,220
I'm off the screen.

645
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,300
Hold on, I'm looking at something to give you.

646
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,020
You said you wanted the scarf, right?

647
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,900
You want a scarf?

648
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,540
No, but this is the one I got.

649
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,400
It's okay.

650
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,440
All right, you're right.

651
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,500
How do I get out?

652
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,280
Oh, there we go.

653
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,840
We're at soaps.

654
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,670
We're, um, we're, um...

655
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,660
Guys, we're here to save our friends!

656
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,060
Yeah!

657
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,440
Our friends!

658
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,140
Wait, how do I...

659
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,800
Can you say hide?

660
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,460
Like, can you say, uh...

661
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,060
Oh, I didn't mean to run back into him.

662
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,380
Can you pay him?

663
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,200
I feel like you should be able to pay him.

664
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,580
It doesn't, there's no prompt that comes up at all.

665
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,340
Ow!

666
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Why'd you do that?

667
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,040
In front of me.

668
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,900
What the hell?

669
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,520
I thought I could maybe take you down with me.

670
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:13,820
Oh.

671
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,400
Wait, there's some stuff over here, though.

672
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:16,980
What's this?

673
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
Oh, more gotcha?

674
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,040
Yeah, I think these are the other faces.

675
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,200
Bottom floor prisoners, props upstairs.

676
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,320
It didn't let me.

677
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,280
Maybe you don't have enough?

678
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,940
It's yarn balls.

679
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,160
Oh, it's not gemmings.

680
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,440
Yeah, mine, apparently mine doesn't count if I redo the level, so I didn't know how much you were mad.

681
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,340
Oh, okay, okay.

682
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,000
All right.

683
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,440
We need to get more gems.

684
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,320
Let's go!

685
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,520
Why does something's not right with my minto?

686
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,060
What do you mean?

687
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,120
What's wrong with me?

688
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,840
What's wrong with me, Berrybug?

689
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,340
What's wrong with me?

690
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,100
You don't think I look okay?

691
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,960
She's becoming violent.

692
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,140
The music is really just sets the tone here, I think.

693
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:09,880
Oh.

694
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

695
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,460
My nipple.

696
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,560
No, please.

697
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,660
Ah.

698
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,000
Ow.

699
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:18,700
Oh.

700
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,480
Get out of here.

701
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,800
Get out of here.

702
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:23,760
Oh.

703
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:24,800
Wait, hold on.

704
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,200
Oh.

705
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:25,920
Oh.

706
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,200
Wait, hold on.

707
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,740
I won't miss.

708
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,340
I won't miss.

709
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,360
I won't miss, hold on.

710
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,000
Are you doing it?

711
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,380
Yep, yep.

712
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

713
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,660
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow.

714
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:43,820
Okay.

715
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I guess that worked.

716
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,120
I did it.

717
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,740
Uh-oh.

718
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,380
What, how?

719
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,200
I just did it.

720
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,640
Okay.

721
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,320
Yeah.

722
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,980
I just did it, too.

723
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,700
Yeah, good job.

724
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,420
Oh!

725
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:01,560
Mystery!

726
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,980
It's a secret!

727
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,580
Oh, Bailey Bug, you're on my head!

728
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:06,880
Yeah!

729
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,500
Billy Bug!

730
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:11,900
Oh, sorry.

731
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,200
Your head is very pointy as well.

732
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:14,880
Oh, oh!

733
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,490
Let me up!

734
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,290
Let me up!

735
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,770
Let me up!

736
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,390
Let me up!

737
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,630
Here, I got you.

738
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,710
Okay, Bailey Bug.

739
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,550
Thanks so much.

740
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:29,830
Wait, Boo!

741
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,790
We gotta get the gem!

742
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,590
Gotta get the gem.

743
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,150
Oh.

744
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,310
Oh, oh.

745
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:33,970
I'm going.

746
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,330
I'm going.

747
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,250
Okay.

748
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:36,790
Okay.

749
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,950
I said, oh, right.

750
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,350
Okay.

751
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,450
Whoa.

752
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,470
Oh, gosh.

753
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,050
Family bug!

754
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,290
Oh, family bug!

755
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,710
Why did you say family bug?

756
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,430
That wasn't my fault.

757
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,150
Wait.

758
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,250
How do I do this?

759
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,170
Oh, here I go.

760
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,850
You left me hanging.

761
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,270
Oh, no, no.

762
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,310
I...

763
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,570
Oh, oh, oh.

764
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,030
Oh, oh, oh.

765
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,770
I didn't do anything.

766
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,850
Oh, Bailey bug.

767
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,190
Help me, Bailey.

768
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,770
Oh, Bailey bug.

769
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,670
I don't from you.

770
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,350
Oh, she dessert.

771
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:11,970
Wait.

772
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,970
Oh, we BAW.

773
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,070
All right, wait.

774
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:23,390
I don't think it's okay.

775
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,170
I'm sorry.

776
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,090
The timing.

777
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:28,810
The timing.

778
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:29,790
Wait.

779
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,210
Wait.

780
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,950
Wait.

781
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:32,810
Wait.

782
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,770
Wait, why'd you end up over there?

783
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,450
Because I made it through.

784
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,470
I don't know, actually.

785
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:39,970
Ah!

786
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,590
Ah!

787
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,750
This is so messed up.

788
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,630
Yeah, get him, get him, push him.

789
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,050
Oh!

790
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,790
I double teamed up.

791
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,570
Yeah.

792
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,490
You killed them.

793
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,790
The skin of a killer, belly bug.

794
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,850
Belly bug.

795
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,550
Oh!

796
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,950
Can we get everything?

797
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,050
Maybe I think so.

798
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,330
Yeah, the art style is very like Adobe Flash.

799
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,070
Yeah, it's fine.

800
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,430
I did, too.

801
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,590
Oh, wait, we missed one.

802
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,590
Wait, we missed two.

803
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,590
How?

804
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,210
Wait, we're the worst at this game.

805
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,610
Uh-oh.

806
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,050
We're the worst.

807
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,810
We're the worst.

808
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,290
We're the absolute worst.

809
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,090
Woo!

810
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,150
Oh, that's fine.

811
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,270
You just made the sound that they usually make the woo.

812
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:30,930
Oh.

813
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,790
Were you a voice?

814
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,090
Sack for us for this game?

815
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,110
Oh, oh, wow.

816
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,510
It's already open.

817
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,230
That's crazy.

818
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,270
Is the game a little quiet for you guys?

819
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,510
I can turn it up.

820
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,610
It feels so loud, though, in my ears.

821
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,390
Yeah, yeah, same ear.

822
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:48,810
Ah!

823
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:49,970
Oh, I didn't look.

824
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,450
I'm waiting for it.

825
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,710
Hi.

826
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,270
Hi, game.

827
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,870
Have you ever played the Flash games, though?

828
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,730
I'm sure you have, but have you ever played them, like, recently?

829
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,170
Not recent.

830
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:02,790
Oh.

831
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,810
Yeah, I used to play Flash games on Newgrounds.

832
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:09,870
Yeah, oh!

833
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,410
What was your favorite?

834
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,470
Did you play Meat and Fuck Kingdom?

835
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,590
Oh, yes!

836
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,250
Wait, okay, so you're the dude?

837
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,390
No, I didn't!

838
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,110
Oh, wait, you didn't?

839
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,510
You did?

840
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,310
Yeah.

841
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,950
Really?

842
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,790
Yeah, I used to play all the Meat and Fuck games.

843
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,550
And then I played like the Galaxy Angel game and the Love Hina game and the Naruto game.

844
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:40,990
Wait, really?

845
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,810
That's crazy.

846
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,150
And then Zone used to also upload on there.

847
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,730
And so there was like a Midna like a screwing simulator.

848
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,090
Wow.

849
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,530
I think you're much more... I was never really a Newgrounds person.

850
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,090
I was like a mini clip.

851
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,290
I played like Happy Wheels and stuff.

852
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,470
Ah!

853
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,400
Happy Wheels.

854
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:03,900
What's that?

855
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,120
Yeah, it's a, it's a, like, a flash game that, where you, like, drive.

856
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,240
And it's, like, very gory and silly.

857
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,520
I got it.

858
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,140
I made it.

859
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,780
Oh, wait.

860
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,300
Come here.

861
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,140
Help.

862
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,360
Come here.

863
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:16,600
Help.

864
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,080
Come here.

865
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,100
Me too.

866
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,460
Thank you.

867
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,000
Ah!

868
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,540
Why did you do that, Barry?

869
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,280
I didn't mean to do that.

870
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:24,820
You're...

871
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,140
Oh.

872
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:25,620
Two.

873
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:26,820
Ah!

874
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,520
Oh, my goodness.

875
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,440
Yeah.

876
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,180
Oh, Me too.

877
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,380
Why did you do that?

878
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,400
Let me help you out.

879
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,080
I live.

880
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,780
Oh, sorry.

881
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,980
I like the way I stare and like...

882
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,500
Yeah, what?

883
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,480
So, with your three eyes.

884
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,840
There we go.

885
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh, what's happening?

886
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,140
Nope, nope, I'm not letting you off.

887
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,540
Oh.

888
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,460
What's this do?

889
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,480
Oh!

890
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,700
That's fine.

891
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,240
Oh, it's...

892
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,560
It's ectoplasm.

893
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,160
Except it's...

894
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,240
Oh.

895
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,840
Wrong color.

896
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,080
Oh!

897
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,380
Oh!

898
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,560
Oh!

899
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,240
Oh!

900
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,320
I want this.

901
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:17,800
Wait.

902
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,320
What's that there?

903
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,280
There's a spy?

904
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,560
Oh my gosh!

905
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,120
I'm sure it does kill...

906
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,820
Maybe we have to...

907
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,500
Ouch!

908
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,740
He licked me.

909
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:26,980
What a freak!

910
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,720
Stop it!

911
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,980
I think I don't know...

912
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,060
Oh, you killed yourself.

913
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,540
Is that what I did?

914
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,540
Yeah, I did.

915
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,180
I think you landed on your own mind.

916
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,460
How do we get this?

917
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,180
Ready?

918
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,440
Oh, what the?

919
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,440
I didn't even know that.

920
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,180
Oh, wait.

921
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:46,920
How do you...

922
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,980
How do we get to there?

923
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Wait, it doesn't go...

Climb up!

00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,380

I wish you could, like, go back through the one level.

She got distracted.

1041
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,860
It was made for climbing.

1042
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,080
Why does a ladder exist if not to climb?

1043
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:25,620
Exactly.

1044
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,680
Ooh, what the hell is that?

1045
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,060
What the fuck?

1046
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,260
Ooh, the music is really good.

1047
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,060
I'm going to take a meow.

00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,980
Oh, I made it.

1049
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,960
Oh, how do I get out?

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:41,600
Okay.

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,640
Oh, boom.

1055
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,340
That was me.

00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,160
Oh, yeah.

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,600
Sorry.

1058
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,500
I thought you an enemy.

1059
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,760
My bad.

1060
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:48,740
That's fine.

1061
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,140
That's fine.

1062
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,180
That's fine.

1063
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,800
No one will hear you scream.

1064
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,220
No, what do you mean?

1065
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:55,800
Oh, wait!

1066
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:04,280
No one will hear you scream.

1067
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,220
Wait, these games get crazy.

1068
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,260

Wait, wait!

1072
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,400
Oh, sorry!

1073
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,060
Okay, I'm going.

1074
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,800
Oh, you're going.

1075
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,420
Oh, okay.

1076
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,540
Oh, no, you're...

1077
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:20,740

Oh, oh, we both...

1080
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,300
Ah!

1081
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,660
One of us lived.

1082
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,460
Oh, quickly, wait!

1083
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,100
Push me!

1084
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,340
What's up?

1085
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:36,600
Ah!

1086
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,720
Oh, berry bug.

1087
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,320
Oh, you made it.

1088
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,420
Yeah, I made it.

1089
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,080
Oh, whoa!

00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,500
Sorry.

1091
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,200
I thought I could make it.

1092
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,240

00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,500
Here, I'll throw you instead.

1112
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:35,140
Oh, that's, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Oh, that was close.

1114
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:37,900
That was close?

1115
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,620
Yeah.

1116
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:41,820
See?

1117
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,340
See?

1118
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:42,860
Look at me.

1119
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,460
Yeah, we're fine.

1120
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,140
Helpful.

1121
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,100
Everything's good.

1122
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,200
I just wanted to help you.

1123
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:51,620
I just...

1124
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,220
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1125
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,900
Why are you laughing?

1126
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,940
Why are you laughing?

1127
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:16,960
Why?

1128
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,410
Come on, Berry Button.

1129
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,910
Who are you?

1130
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,850
Come on, Berry Button.

1131
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,030
I can't.

1132
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:29,390
I can't.

1133
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,350
I can't.

1134
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:32,990
Okay, thank you.

1135
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:33,010
Okay, I didn't do that, though.

1136
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,190
I can't.

1137
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,430
Okay, I didn't do that though.

1138
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:36,530
Okay, I didn't do that though.

1139
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,030
Okay, thank you.

1140
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,330
Okay, I didn't do that though.

1141
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,370
Okay, I didn't do that though.

1142
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,010
Alright, here I go!

1143
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,110
Oh!

1144
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:46,950
Oh!

1145
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,730
Oh, and then you have to drop the boat for me.

1146
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:50,230
Yeah.

1147
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,370
Thank you, Minko.

1148
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,820
Hey, look at us.

1149
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,700
We're...

1150
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,400
Go get it.

1151
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,240
Me?

1152
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:00,680
Yeah.

1153
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:02,800
Trust.

1154
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:03,480
Trust.

1155
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,440
Okay, okay.

1156
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,840
I knew you'd make it.

1157
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,540
I knew you'd make it.

1158
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,240
I knew you'd make it.

1159
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:10,360
I knew you'd make it.

1160
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:10,840
Wait, who was that?

1161
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,600
That guy has a deformed head.

1162
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,500
Oh, he's carrying one!

1163
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,140
He's stealing it!

1164
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,440
Yea, get him!

1165
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,500
Oh, get him!

1166
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,280
Yeah, yeah, get him!

1167
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,100
I had him.

1168
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,380
Get him!

1169
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,300
Oh, he's...

1170
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,020
Oh, he's dying.

1171
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:22,520
Wait.

1172
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,920
I got it.

1173
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,900
Oh, nice.

1174
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,240
Nice.

1175
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,440
Yeah, yeah.

1176
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,180
Okay, okay.

1177
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,100
He sacrificed himself.

1178
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, me too.

1179
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,380
Wait, there's a secret.

1180
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,320
I can feel it.

1181
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:35,940
Yeah.

1182
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,120
Oh.

1183
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:38,940
Good job.

1184
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,280
Wait, what is this?

1185
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
This is like suspicious.

1186
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,020
Maybe it's not suspicious.

1187
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,500
Maybe it's not suspicious.

1188
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,380
Maybe.

1189
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,280
I think we're good.

1190
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,340
Yay!

1191
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,400
I think that's all of it, right?

1192
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,360
I don't think we missed anything.

1193
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,940
I guess we'll see.

1194
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,980
I guess we'll see.

1195
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,540
We're definitely not making time.

1196
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,080
We missed one!

1197
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,060
Wait, we didn't win!

1198
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,120
What happened?

1199
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,320
I thought we got everything.

1200
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,840
I know.

1201
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:04,660
What the heck?

1202
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,040
Oh.

1203
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,500
Oh!

1204
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,280
Is there a bow?

1205
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,420

Oh, what does this do?

Got it?

1249
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,370
Oh, nice, nice.

1250
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,210
Now do you think we got all of them?

1251
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:52,870
I don't know.

1252
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,450
Oh, there's something here.

1253
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:55,290
There's something here.

1254
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:56,450
Oh, wait.

1255
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,270
Hold on.

1256
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,830
I'll check it out.

1257
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:01,830
Oh, just kidding.

1258
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:04,950
No, keep going up here?

1259
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,290
Keep going here.

1260
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,770
And then it does this.

1261
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,630
Now you can go.

1262
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:12,450
Now you can go.

1263
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:13,470
Oh, I see.

1264
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,470
Yeah, I had to stop the laser.

1265
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:17,610
Yeah, okay.

1266
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,430
Yeah, we did it.

1267
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:19,850
Yeah!

1268
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,500
There's not like a die encounter, is there?

1269
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:27,900
I don't...

1270
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,580
Maybe there is later in the game, but I don't think there is yet.

1271
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,680
I'm sure there is like a stat tracker though.

1272
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,680
Are you a real rabies survivor?

1273
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,760
Um, what?

1274
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,980
You think I would just steal...

1275
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,360
Oops, sorry.

1276
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,680
You think I would just steal Valor like that?

1277
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,840
I don't think I can make that.

1278
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,180
I think you gotta go on ahead.

1279
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,060
Okay.

1280
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,180
Oh, I got you.

1281
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:54,600
Yeah.

1282
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,440
Yeah.

1283
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:57,860
I guess.

1284
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,620
Here, I'll climb on your head.

1285
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:02,900
Oh, ouch.

1286
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,160
I died from that.

1287
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,840
That's crazy.

1288
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,320
My bad, my bad, my bad, my bad.

1289
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,480
That's crazy.

1290
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,420
I think you gotta jump.

1291
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,440
There you go.

1292
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,420

00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:21,800
Get out of here.

1295
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:22,760
Get out of here.

1296
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,800
Kill him, kill him.

1297
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,700
Get out of here.

1298
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,420
Get out of here.

1299
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,220
Get out of here.

1300
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,380
Get out of here.

1301
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,520
Oh, he's on me.

1302
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,220
Okay.

1303
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:35,430
Oh, wait.

1304
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:36,350
Oh, no.

1305
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,230
You've been speared.

1306
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,730
Oops, I did it again.

1307
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,210
Uh-oh.

1308
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:41,250
Wait, okay, hold on.

1309
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,650
Oh, I'm fine.

1310
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:43,110
We're fine.

1311
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,410
Oh, Daya, hello.

00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:55,030
Oh, wait.

1318
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,970

1321
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,330
She's thinking?

1322
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:58,750
She's thinking?

1323
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,250
I knew it.

1324
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,110
It's because I played meat and fuck.

1325
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:03,190
I know.

1326
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,110
This is my era.

Wait, is there anything up here?

1354
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:15,290
No, it's just the eyes.

00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:15,550
Okay.

1356
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:16,650

00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:18,250
I'm coming.

1358
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:24,810
The game's got, like, kind of crazy with, like, with, like, quests and everything.

1359
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:25,750
They were fine.

1360
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,610
I liked them.

1361
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:26,830
Oh.

1362
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:28,150
Uh-oh.

1363
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,510
We're not going to want to go anymore.

1364
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,450
You're just not going to want to.

1365
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,670
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1366
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,310
Yeah, yeah.

00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:37,590
Oh, wait, wait.

1369
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,450
I missed the...

1370
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,110
Oh, me too.

1371
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:40,030
Oh, I'm drowning.

1372
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,210
Wait, do we go...

1373
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,750
Is this, like, an instance where you go left and I go right?

1374
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:44,930
That's what I was thinking.

1375
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,010
So...

1376
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:46,210
Oh.

1377
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:47,990
Well...

1378
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,970
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, no!

1379
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,770
It's good to go the other way.

1380
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,910
Okay, I'll go once I can.

1381
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,970
Yeah, I believe in you.

1382
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:56,730
I believe in you.

1383
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,690
Oh my gosh, the screen is so small now.

1384
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,630
It's just better to look at everything, Liz.

1385
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,810
Better to look at me, my dear.

1386
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,530
Yeah, let's do it.

1387
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:09,270
We did it.

1388
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,330
Oh, shoot.

1389
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,670
We did it.

1390
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,810
Oh, thank you.

1391
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:12,830
Woo!

1392
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,930
Oh, oh, oh.

1393
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,390
Hey we made it easy peasy.

1394
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,310
We're watching here.

1395
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:22,630
Oh yeah.

1396
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,630
Oh, you got them.

1397
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,030
You got them, you got them.

1398
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,330
Oh, I'm sorry, I love you.

1399
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,290
You got them.

1400
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:29,370
I got him.

1401
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,510
I got him.

1402
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:31,450
I got another thing.

1403
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:33,970
Yeah, I think so actually.

1404
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1405
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,070
Okay.

1406
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:36,710
One, two, three.

1407
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,330
I think there's seven per now.

1408
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:42,010
I think it's, it seems like it's different.

1409
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:42,670
Oh, okay.

1410
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,110
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1411
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,430
Patty is giving us two thumbs up.

1412
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,930
Yeah, because we did so well.

1413
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,490
Except we're kind of slow, but...

1414
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:55,830
We're exploring.

1415
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:01,290
Okay, it seems like we can do the boss level or we could do...

1416
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,450
Oh, Encore.

1417
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,250

1418
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:04,270

Time Challenges.

1421
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:10,710
Sorry, I meant to say time challenges when I said Tyler.

1422
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,930
Yeah, any Tyler's in chat?

1423
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,990

You instantly changed into him.

1433
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,610
Oh, he's chilling.

1434
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,410
Yeah, I'm sipping my martini.

1435
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,310
Oh, sorry.

1436
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:34,930
Oh, you did that.

1437
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:35,690
Yes.

1438
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,190
I'm not sorry.

1439
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,810
Wait, I might be able to now get some...

1440
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:41,030
a new weapon, actually.

1441
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:41,650
Oh, I can!

1442
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:42,130
Oh!

1443
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,270
Wait, so...

1444
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,310
I think it's gotcha.

1445
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:45,950
I think it's random.

1446
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1447
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:47,870
Here I go.

1448
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,330
Here you go.

1449
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:51,830
A paper plane.

1450
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,210
I got a paper plane.

1451
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,450
Uh, I think you'll equip that.

1452
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:58,710
I think it's another bomb.

1453
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:01,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1454
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,550
You have to equip that.

1455
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,490
Wait, what the fuck?

1456
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:05,450
Oh!

1457
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:07,130
Oh!

1458
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:09,950
Oh, I see.

1459
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,250
Ah!

1460
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,050
So it's deadly.

1461
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,150
It first knocks you out.

1462
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:17,490
Oh.

1463
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:18,610
Yeah.

1464
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:19,770
Oh, it missed.

1465
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,270
Oh, are you controlling it?

1466
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,170
I don't think so.

1467
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,110
I also have to wait, I think, for it to explode.

1468
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,230
Oh, that makes sense.

1469
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,670
Yeah, I can't, like, spam it.

1470
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:31,550
No, I'm definitely not controlling it.

1471
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,590
I'm going to buy another head.

1472
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:36,110
Okay, okay, okay.

1473
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,690
I like how the cats are purring.

1474
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:38,330
It's so cute.

1475
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,510
Oh, what is that?

1476
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:43,570
That was a mess.

Okay.

1479
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:16,910
If you throw it, like, yeah.

1480
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,010
Okay, here we go.

1481
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:18,670
Get on.

1482
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,450
Oh!

1483
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,330
I saw you!

1484
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:20,750
Oh!

1485
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,790
I saw it for, like, a second.

1486
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,750
Yeah, yeah, you definitely jumped on it.

1487
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:26,410
It's gonna explode.

1488
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:28,410
Somehow, eventually.

1489
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:29,390
Okay.

1490
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,570
It'll explode.

1491
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:31,290
Can you control one of them?

1492
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,350
Three, two, one.

1493
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,330
Explode.

1494
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:33,850
Okay.

1495
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,470
It's not exploding.

1496
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:37,310
It's not exploding.

1497
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:38,990
It's not exploding.

1498
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,010
Push it off the...

1499
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:41,830
There we go.

1500
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:43,530
Uh...

1501
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,450
It's...

1502
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,530
Oh, maybe I do.

1503
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,390
Oh, I detonate it.

1504
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:47,870
Oh.

1505
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,470
I can even detonate it in the air.

1506
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,450
Oh, my gosh.

1507
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:55,550
This is huge.

1508
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,950
Uh-oh.

1509
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:58,530
Whoops.

1510
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:02,050
Whatever.

1511
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:03,670
Hey.

1512
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,010
She's just...

1513
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:05,510
Uh-oh.

1514
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,210
No, no, no, no.

1515
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:08,610
Look at my face.

1516
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,470
I don't look...

1517
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,130
No, no, no, no.

1518
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,210
Oh, no.

1519
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,350
Ready for a boss?

1520
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,030
Is this a boss?

1521
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,030
Or is this the boss?

1522
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,230
Yeah, I think this is a boss.

1523
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:17,550
Okay.

1524
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,670
Let's go!

1525
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,270
Let's go!

1526
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:22,090
Let's go!

1527
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,190
Look at us.

1528
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,950
Look at us backstage.

1529
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:29,130
Wow.

1530
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,350
At our show.

1531
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,250
Like, just act natural.

1532
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,670
Wait, it's a theater.

1533
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:37,650
That's so cute.

1534
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,110
Battle block theater.

1535
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,890
Yeah, because we're putting on a show, I think.

1536
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:42,310
Maybe?

1537
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:46,450
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1538
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:58,370
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1539
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,110
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1540
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,020

1541
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,340
So race against the clock, maybe.

1542
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We have to lock it.

1543
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,060
Oh, I'm not locking.

1544
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,080
I died.

1545
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:24,700
Wait, hold on.

1546
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,640
Don't be careful!

1547
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:26,060
Wait!

1548
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,280
Yeah, that's a better option.

1549
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,840
Yeah, that's a better option.

1550
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,280
Oh my gosh, this is...

1551
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,300
We only have 40 seconds.

1552
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,500
Oh wait, no, we have...

1553
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,420
Oh, oh, it adds time.

1554
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,480
Oh, okay, good, good.

1555
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,700
Okay, we can't fuck it around.

1556
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,400
No fucking around.

1557
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:41,860
Oh!

1558
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,900
Is the fire burnable?

1559
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:44,340
Okay.

1560
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,080
I don't think...

1561
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,680
Oh, oh, oh.

1562
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:47,800
I don't think...

1563
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:47,840
Oh, oh, oh.

1564
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, I blew him up!

1565
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,860
Oh, I blew him up!

1566
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,890
Oh, my God!

1567
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:53,450
It's working!

1568
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,110
It's working!

1569
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,230
Oh, oh, oh!

1570
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:57,370
Well, I'm getting the yarn!

1571
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,090
Okay, nice.

1572
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:58,970
Okay.

1573
01:06:59,030 --> 01:06:59,310
Alright.

1574
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,950
Okay.

1575
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:02,750
Oh, be careful.

1576
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,390
Yeah, be careful.

1577
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,110
This music's kind of crazy.

1578
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:08,250
Go, go!

1579
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,550
Oh, we have 30 seconds.

1580
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:10,230
We have 30 seconds.

1581
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:10,830
No, we got more.

1582
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:11,350
We'll have to get more.

1583
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,790
There we go.

1584
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:12,950
Oh, no, we won't.

1585
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:13,710
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1586
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,110
Kind of?

1587
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,910
Wait, what is this?

1588
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:16,810
Uh, I think...

1589
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:17,510
Wait, is there a secret?

1590
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:17,890
Yes!

1591
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,470
I got it!

1592
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:19,190
Oh, there was a secret!

1593
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:22,670
Secret okay okay okay okay.

1594
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:23,150
Wait, okay, okay.

1595
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:23,470
Come here!

1596
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,270
Oh, I'm coming!

1597
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:27,390
Okay, okay, okay.

1598
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,210
We got more time.

1599
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,230
Oh wait, wait, wait.

1600
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:30,570
Oh shoot.

1601
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:31,210
Oh shoot.

1602
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:32,750
Okay, wait, wait.

1603
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:33,830
There's a gem up there.

1604
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,650
Yeah, I know.

1605
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:35,410
Because you get it.

1606
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:36,170
I'm trying.

1607
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:36,930
I'm trying.

1608
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,770
I got it!

1609
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:38,310
Nice!

1610
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:39,910
Did we get everything?

1611
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,770
Oh, nice!

1612
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,050
I don't know if we did or not.

1613
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:43,610
Wait, there's a second phase?

1614
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,990
What?

1615
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:44,650
There's a second?

1616
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:45,790
What's that a ghost?

1617
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:46,830
It's so cute!

1618
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,110
They're upskirting us though.

1619
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,650
That's what I do in my 3D all the time.

1620
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,330
It's a real true ghost.

1621
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,830
Yeah, I'll ghost do that you guys.

1622
01:07:59,310 --> 01:07:59,310
Duh.

1623
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,750
Wait, there's like a teleporter down here.

1624
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:06,110
Is there?

1625
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:08,110
Oh!

1626
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:09,910
Oh, you got the gem!

1627
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:10,450
Nice!

1628
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,130
Wow, I be looking, man.

1629
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,910
Yeah, I didn't see that at all.

1630
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:14,870
Okay, nice.

1631
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:15,770
Oh gosh.

1632
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:19,150
I can look at you with my big bug eyes.

1633
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:20,050
Where do we go?

1634
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:21,510
Okay.

1635
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,030
Okay.

1636
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:24,430
Nice.

1637
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:25,330
Nice.

1638
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:27,590
Nice.

1639
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:30,410
Nice.

1640
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,610
Not nice.

1641
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:37,730
Oh, go on without me!

1642
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:38,950
Okay.

1643
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:39,270
Bye.

1644
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:39,730
Okay.

1645
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:39,950
Bye.

1646
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:44,690
Okay.

1647
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:45,350
I'm here.

1648
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:45,770
Okay.

1649
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,130
Oh, sorry.

1650
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:50,550
Oh, no worries.

1651
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,030
Oh, I killed him.

1652
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:52,690
It's fine.

1653
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,610
This has got to be a secret, no?

1654
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,610
No, I don't like it.

1655
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:58,330
Okay, just kidding.

1656
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:01,930
Oh, it's just an area to get...

1657
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:02,070
Okay.

1658
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,130
Oh, ouch.

1659
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:03,770
My bad.

1660
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:06,490
Oh, why did I do that?

1661
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:07,890
You got it.

1662
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,550
You got it.

1663
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,490
Oh, why?

1664
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,550
How did you get through?

1665
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:13,170
I just jumped on the thingy.

1666
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:13,690
We jump.

1667
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:14,330
We're jumping.

1668
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,450
We're fine.

1669
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:16,910
Oh.

1670
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:17,430
Oh.

1671
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:18,550
Wait, what?

1672
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:19,330
What is that?

1673
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:19,950
They're spies?

1674
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:22,790
Yeah, but, oh, you just jumped.

1675
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:23,270
Oh.

1676
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,130
Hey, you're welcome.

1677
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:27,950
Oh, it's fine.

1678
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:28,630
I made it here.

1679
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:29,770
Yeah.

1680
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,130
We have 15 seconds.

1681
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:32,750
Oh, shit.

1682
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,030
Oh, shit.

1683
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,690
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1684
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:36,330
Go, go, go, go.

1685
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,550
Rindo, I'm dying!

1686
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,810
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1687
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:43,810
I'm going.

1688
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,630
I got it Oh, I just ran

1689
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,250
Well, wait, what is this?

1690
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,050
What is this being torture?

1691
01:09:55,010 --> 01:10:09,110
Wow, we're famous Oh, we're famous Wow Look at us Oh, my gosh, I barely You sure know how to make the best I couldn't see anything at the end But boy, this place is quite the enigma Wouldn't you say?

1692
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:25,290
I would And you know, a little warning Would have been nice You know, before they threw us head first And then into this gladiatorial, prison-y place with its perilous medley of twisted stage productions that shred the silky fabric which weaves together the fragile blanket of sanity that keeps us sane.

1693
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,390
But, you know, whatever.

1694
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:29,750
Either way, it's safe to say we're in credit- This is very, like, new ground.

1695
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:30,730
Seen us.

1696
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,170
Wow, what's happening?

1697
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,630
I mean, they do the same for you.

1698
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,130
Why is he doing that?

1699
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,110
The adventuring just wouldn't be the same without...

1700
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:37,090
I don't know, this guy.

1701
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,710
I think this is a good cop, bad cop?

1702
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:43,730
Food so stupid, delicious, one taste would blow your face through the back of your head.

1703
01:10:43,810 --> 01:11:00,590
Like bang splat and who could forget this quirky fellow, you know, he owns a bat farm that Oh, his lifelong dream is to breed a terrifying race of super bats None of which makes any sense of course because he's absolutely terrified of bats and this lovely lass always tells the best bedtime stories Oh,

1704
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,190
so that's good.

1705
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:08,110
And then there's this guy and this handsome fellow and that Oh, these are friends.

1706
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,570
All your best friends in prison.

1707
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:10,410
Why is this the cobra?

1708
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:49,350
They don't like you very much because it's bad and horrible and then there's Hattie the best friend of all why did he stab us in the back and twist the blade I mean just this morning he gave everybody flowers and presents and now he goes out of his way to hurt our feelings oh I think not you can't fool me Hattie would never betray us betray us never betray us something she's going on here and I think I don't like how this seems very one take it must have something yeah albeit fashionable hat sure looks yeah never trust hats glowy red and stuff glowy red stuff So what's dangerous treats lie in store as we continue to unravel this treacherous sweater?

1709
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:52,510
I don't know use caution as you continue your gallant endeavor.

1710
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:56,330
Don't don't like fail and die and stuff because it's- No, we wouldn't.

1711
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:58,010
We wouldn't.

1712
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:58,370
We wouldn't.

1713
01:11:58,410 --> 01:11:59,090
We wouldn't.

1714
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,370
That was scary.

1715
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,230
Is he okay?

1716
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,130
He's not okay.

1717
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,670

Why did you aim it at me?

Maybe it just explodes on contact?

1730
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,000
Maybe.

1731
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:33,780

01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,620
Oh, watch out.

1747
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,940
He kind of looks like a Domo.

1748
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,340
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,180
Oh.

Yeah, I'll kick his ass.

1769
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:36,260
I'm throwing grenades.

1770
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:36,820
I'm getting him.

1771
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:37,680
I'm getting him.

1772
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,560
I'm throwing grenades.

1773
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,140
I'm helping.

1774
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:39,740
Okay, okay.

1775
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:40,880
Yeah.

You're helping.

1777
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,380
Maybe if I throw it from this angle.

1778
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,360
Oh, he's gone.

1779
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,440
No, I already killed him.

1780
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,780
How do you get over?

1781
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,240
Oh, it's probably...

1782
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:52,500
We got it.

1783
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,240
You got him?

1784
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:54,660
Oh.

1785
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,080
No, I didn't.

1786
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,580
So close.

1787
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,580
You're so close.

1788
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,780
Wait, hold on.

1789
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,260
Okay, I got it.

1790
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:07,760
I helped.

You helped.

1793
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,140
And I died.

1794
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:10,560
Oh, no.

1795
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,540
It's fine.

1796
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,320
I'm up here.

1797
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,680
Oh, be careful.

1798
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,640
Be careful.

1799
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:16,300
There you go.

1800
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:16,540
Nice.

1801
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,700

01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,480
You didn't die?

1808
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,480

I didn't even realize.

1887
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,450
I'm gaming unintentionally.

A golden hat has appeared.

1908
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,410
Bring it to the exit and I'll make it rain.

1909
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:10,350
Wait, make it to the exit and I'll make it rain.

1910
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,330
What?

1911
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:13,390
Really?

1912
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:14,130
What is this?

1913
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:16,590

1914
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,530
I got it.

1915
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:23,010
Oh, I, you know, I think that the hat thing is, is play, it's like player side.

1916
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:25,530
So only you and I can have it, but not both of us.

1917
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,790
Oh, oh, I hope I don't die.

1918
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,490
Okay, we're fine.

1919
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:29,210
Oh, okay.

1920
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:29,930
I'm fine.

1921
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:30,710
Everything's fine.

1922
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,050
Wait, where'd the hat go?

1923
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:38,230
Uh, I think it got the, it just got deleted from the, I think you still have it.

01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,170
Me, me, me, me.

What?

1927
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:42,750
No!

1928
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:43,210
No!

1929
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:44,030

01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,810
I have it!

1931
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,290
I'm going to try to kill you.

1932
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,850
What if I wanted the hat?

1933
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,270
Well, you can get a next time.

1934
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:00,810
Jeez, slow poke.

1935
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:05,890
I'm sorry I just didn't sniff out the freaking secret.

1936
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:06,690
Like, something.

1937
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:07,870
I bet you cheated.

1938
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:08,910
What?

1939
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:10,330
I'm a cheater.

1940
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:11,650
I'm not a cheater.

1941
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,470
But I am a pumpkin eater.

1942
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:14,610
I'll admit that.

1943
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,210
Oh.

1944
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:16,630
I'm stuck.

1945
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,190
Oh, wait, what the hell?

1946
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,410
There, I'm better now.

1947
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:20,090
We're fine.

1948
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,710
I got the yarn up there.

1949
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:24,910
Okay.

1950
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:29,730
You got this?

1951
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:32,490
I got it.

1952
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:33,350
Is there anything up here?

1953
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:34,030
Wait, hold on.

1954
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:34,810
The next thing?

1955
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,630
I don't think so.

1956
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:37,710
Oh, I don't think so, yeah.

1957
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:40,530
Be careful.

1958
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:42,650
Oh, wait.

1959
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:43,650
There's a...

1960
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,170
Oh, there's a...

1961
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:47,110
Boop, boop, boop.

1962
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,060
Boop, boop.

1963
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:51,840
Okay, there we go.

1964
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,460
Oh, nice!

1965
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:56,200
Thanks.

1966
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,000
I actually got him.

1967
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,340
I am a gamer.

1968
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:00,640
You're gaming, you're gaming.

1969
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,340
I am a gamer.

1970
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,400
No chicken hat for you, you're gaming.

1971
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,300
No, I like the chicken hat, actually.

1972
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,100
I think it's pretty cute.

1973
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,880
That sounds like cope to me, though.

1974
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:09,820
What?

1975
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:10,680
No.

1976
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:12,740
I don't know.

1977
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,980
Wait, what's down here?

1978
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:14,940
What's down here?

1979
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,700
Oh, I came from down there.

1980
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,120
Oh, you did?

1981
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:17,680
Okay, just kidding.

I think the chicken has cute.

1984

Oh.

1985
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,500
He's not a chicken, he's a snake.

1986
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:30,500
Yeah, but it's so, it lights up and it's so cute and they laugh at you.

1987
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:31,460
Oh, it lights up, really?

1988
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:31,960
Yeah.

1989
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,860

Oh, wait, but there's more!

01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,980
Yeah, there's a lot more, actually, we haven't gotten.

2006
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:03,180
Yeah.

2007
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,380
Ah, wait, I hit myself.

2008
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:05,940
I got him.

2009
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:06,920
Okay, nice.

2010
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,080
I think we got both of them.

2011
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:09,640
Right?

2012
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,960
Is that not everything?

2013
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:11,620
Yeah, that is.

2014
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,040
You're right.

2015
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:13,340
Okay.

2016
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:16,620
Unless you're the secret.

2017
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,320
I think we're good.

2018
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,820
Oh, why did you do that?

2019
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,580
Oh, wait, that's me.

2020
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:27,880
Oh, someone said he's not a crocodile either, but he wears a crocodile hat.

2021
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,740
But that's because he's camouflaged.

2022
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,340
The chicken is not camouflaged.

2023
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,420
The chicken's not camouflaged!

2024
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,140
It sounds like cop!

2025
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,160
Wow, what do you mean?

2026
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:38,860
What do you mean?

2027
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,780
That's not cop!

2028
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:45,620
Let's go.

2029
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,200
I guess it is true that he's cropped up.

2030
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,260
I love the croc hat.

2031
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,240
Why is he so like crazy for the gems?

2032
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,120
Because that's money.

2033
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,680
Money, money, baby.

2034
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:03,780
Wait, do you have the money toggle?

2035
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,320
The... the...

2036
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:08,740
What?

2037
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,980
I don't have that!

2038
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,080
Oh, damn.

2039
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,280
Minto needs an update.

2040
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,620
Wait, what are these guys for?

2041
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:17,980

Okay, I'll put it here.

2054
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:03,860
Okay.

2055
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:04,700
Wait.

2056
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,780
Oh, wait, wait.

01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2058
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,140
Oh, wait, I'm not...

2059
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,580
It's my brain!

2060
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:10,980
Okay, alright, we're fine.

2061
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:11,440
We got this.

2062
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:11,860
Well, we're...

2063
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:12,800
Well, I understand now.

2064
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:13,640
I understand now.

2065
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:15,880
Oh!

2066
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,400
Oh, oh, oh, wait, hold on.

2067
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,560
I think we do need it though, no?

2068
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,500
Or do we just use these guys?

2069
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,360
No, I think we just use the Domo guys.

2070
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:26,560
Okay.

2071
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:27,780
Oh, wait.

2072
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,620
I gotta wait for him to come back.

2073
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:30,960
Yeah.

2074
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,500
Okay.

2075
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:34,980
All right.

2076
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,040
Oh.

2077
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:36,920
Interesting.

2078
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:37,920
Oh, watch out!

2079
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:41,400
So close.

2080
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,200
We're gaming.

2081
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,760
Well, that's definitely a secret.

2082
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,120
Yeah, that's definitely a secret.

2083
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,620
We know now.

2084
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,760
We're just so smart.

2085
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:54,740
Oh, I missed.

2086
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,460
It's okay.

2087
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:02,120
We got it.

2088
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,280
It's okay.

2089
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,280
You got it.

2090
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,600
No, go back there.

2091
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:11,220
Wait, wait, wait, don't throw your grenade at me.

2092
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:12,580
Uh-huh.

2093
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,320
Okay, you got this block puzzle.

2094
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:15,820
Yeah, it's a block.

2095
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,060
Yeah!

2096
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,120
I'm so smart.

2097
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:23,840
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2098
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:25,240
Oh, it's that thing again.

2099
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,960
Oh, wait, wait, I have to go back.

2100
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:29,060
Move!

2101
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,520
Ah, wait!

2102
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,460
Is he a friend or a foe?

2103
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,400
I think he's friend.

2104
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,100
Did he try to kill him?

2105
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,620
I don't know if we can even...

2106
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,100
Maybe he leads us to somewhere.

2107
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,300
Wait, jump on my shoulders?

2108
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,400
Okay.

2109
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,180
Go up there?

2110
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,560
Oh, go up there.

2111
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:50,960
There you go.

2112
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,620
Oh, wait, wait, wait, come up here, come up here.

2113
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,520
I will get you up here.

2114

I'm coming.

2115
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,320
There you go.

2116
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:00,980
Okay.

2117
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:01,680
There you go.

2118
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:02,760
Okay.

2119
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,000
Wait, uh, uh, okay, maybe you get off of the thing.

2120
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,520
And then...

2121
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:08,760
Oh!

01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:10,300

Because, uh, it's like...

It's like...

2152
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,220
Telling us that we've completed levels that we didn't complete.

2153
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,120
No, it's okay.

2154

I'm too much of a gamer.

2159
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,640
You're gaming, you're gaming.

2160
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:35,660
Oh, why the hell did I get all the way back here?

2161
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,200
Oh, sorry.

2162
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,400
That might have been because of me.

2163
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,080
Oh, it's okay.

2164
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:39,420

Of course we solve puzzles.

2184
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:09,980
Yeah.

2185
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:16,860
Oh, shoot.

2186
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,980
Why did I do that?

2187
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,420
Oh, we could actually talk about this, but...

2188
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:26,960
Yeah, I guess like, IRL we've met up, like, a couple of times.

2189
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,800
Because we also met up during the Delta pop-up, right?

2190
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:31,100
Yeah!

2191
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:42,720
Yeah, and then he walked all the way to fucking, like, Liberty, whatever, to, to, to, like, a pilgrimage, the, where, where I didn't know.

2192
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,360
Yeah, Federal Hall, that's what it's called.

2193
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,940
Sorry, I had no idea what it was.

2194
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,320
I just recognized it.

2195
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,580
I did.

2196
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,900
Yeah, I was like, I gotta go see it.

2197
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,260
I gotta go see my president.

2198
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,500
Dude, she...

2199
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:00,320
Meant is crazy, because she, like, pulled out, like, the solidest, like, action figure.

2200
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,760
out of her, like, backpack snows.

2201
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,760
It was crazy.

2202
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,860
I brought all my toys.

2203
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,860
All your toys.

2204
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,400
I only brought my little guy.

2205
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,440
It was, it's my, I don't ever go to New York.

2206
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,280
It's my chance.

2207
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,300
Yeah, but I guess that's true.

2208
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:25,260
Maybe, maybe I should have brought my ride in Nendo.

2209
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,060
Oh, yeah, it would have been good.

2210
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,360
Yeah, the little guy, though, The one from the...

2211
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,580
Oh, what is this?

2212
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,280
What is this?

2213
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,080
What's going on here?

2214
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,080
The one from the gotcha...

2215
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,440
Gotcha machine.

2216
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:44,860
Yeah, I know.

2217
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,380
The little guy.

2218
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:47,920
Yeah, the little guy.

2219
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:48,740
Yeah, the little guy.

2220
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,920
Someone in chat didn't...

2221
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:50,820
Someone in chat didn't.

2222
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:53,320
Oh, they will know.

2223
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,020
They will know.

2224
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,940
Are you good?

2225
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:58,520
Okay, I'm just gonna self-destruct.

2226
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,020
Oh!

2227
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,260
What's this?

2228
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,160
Uh-oh.

2229
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:04,380
Oh.

2230
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:04,680
Oh.

2231
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:05,180
Oh.

2232
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:05,520
Oh.

2233
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:05,620
Oh.

2234
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:05,880
Be careful.

2235
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:07,880
Oh, wait.

2236
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,060
What?

2237
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:08,920
You weren't careful?

2238
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:09,760
Uh, no.

2239
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,540
I was totally careful.

2240
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:11,500
Okay.

2241
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,860
I'm always careful.

2242
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:13,920
I'm always careful.

2243
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:15,920
Oh!

2244
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,240
Oh, wait.

2245
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,160
I didn't notice.

2246
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:20,680
Oh!

2247
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:23,480
Oh, can you just walk?

2248
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:24,020
Oh, wait.

2249
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:24,380
No, you can't.

2250
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:24,800
No, you can't.

2251
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,240
Oh.

2252
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:27,700
You gotta walk onto the next guy.

Don't get your ass out of my face!

2255
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,400
I'm killing him.

2256
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,860
Oh, he died himself.

2257
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:07,600
Yeah, he...

2258
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,400
Oh, gosh.

Be careful!

2260
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:18,570
She's killing me, you guys.

2261
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:19,750
She's bullying.

2262
01:34:19,770 --> 01:34:20,950
I did nothing.

2263
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:23,450
That was all me.

2264
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:26,410
This is payback for a...

2265
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:29,590
Five is a good number, bit.

2266
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:30,990
What?

2267
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:37,090
I think it was like something like, oh, five is a good number and you were just like, do you just say anything?

2268
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,510
Wait, we're missing one.

2269
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:44,750
Are we?

2270
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:46,270
Oh, wait, you might be right.

2271
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,870
Yeah, because it's supposed to be seven.

2272
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,430
No, that's not it.

2273
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:51,990
During the lore game, yeah.

2274
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:59,070
Dude, I have to visit you sometime and so I can play PT at your house.

2275
01:34:59,510 --> 01:34:59,810
Yay!

2276
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:03,090
Come visit me!

2277
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:04,090
Come visit me!

2278
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:04,450
Come visit me!

2279
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:05,010
Come visit me!

2280
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:06,230
Ah, no stop!

2281
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:08,570
You're like the only person...

2282
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:11,090
You're like the last person with Flappy Bird on their phone.

2283
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:12,050
Yeah!

2284
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,510
Someone said we got it all, are we sure?

2285
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:16,990
Oh, you... baby?

2286
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:22,450
Yeah, October is coming up.

2287
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:23,670
Oh, we did!

2288
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:24,030
Nice!

2289
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:24,830
Did we get the time?

2290
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,750
We did get the time?

2291
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,510
Yeah, we were just standing there talking.

2292
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:31,630
Who needs time?

2293
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:32,630
Who needs time?

2294
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:34,010
Yeah, who needs time?

2295
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:36,250
Oh, maybe you can...

2296
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:37,710
Yeah, block them, block them.

2297
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:38,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2298
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,950
Minecraft them, Minecraft them.

2299
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:41,170
Oh.

2300
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:43,790
Yeah, yeah, get him.

2301
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:46,850
Wait, it's mine.

2302
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:47,810
It's mine.

2303
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:48,930
It's mine.

2304
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:49,810
It's mine.

2305
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:50,050
Stop, stop, stop.

2306
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:51,290
We're not even there yet, are we?

2307
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:52,850
It's mine.

2308
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:54,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2309
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:57,090
You make that dream, Carol.

2310
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,930
Make it.

2311
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:58,810
Oh.

2312
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:00,610
Ah!

2313
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,110
Oh no!

2314
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:05,490
Why did the game punish me?

2315
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:08,590
Why did the game punish me?

2316
01:36:08,730 --> 01:36:09,270
Oh, oops.

2317
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:11,850
Oopsie.

2318
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:12,590
Wait, huh?

2319
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:14,130
Wait, why didn't it go?

2320
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:15,870
You gotta pull it.

2321
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:17,890
I'm pulling it though.

2322
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:18,610
You're doing it?

2323
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:19,170
Yeah, you are.

2324
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:20,910
Wait, why?

2325
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:21,810
Why isn't it?

2326
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,330
Wait, hold on.

2327
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:23,190
I'm so weak.

2328
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:23,870
There we go.

2329
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:25,790
Wait, I'm so weak.

2330
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:29,110
Can you call it over?

2331
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:29,450
Huh?

2332
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:31,770
Wait, why isn't it going on?

2333
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:35,310
I have no sexual appeal.

2334
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,210
Let me try.

2335
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,210
Okay.

2336
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:39,490
Let a real man do it.

2337
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:41,110
Wait, what do you mean?

2338
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:42,770
Wait, what do you mean?

2339
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:45,270
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what the...

2340
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:46,850
Wait, that's so BS.

2341
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:47,950
What does that mean?

2342
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,090
What did they mean?

2343
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:50,270
I don't know.

2344
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:54,190
That has to be a glitch, right?

2345
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:54,970
No.

2346
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,050
I mean...

2347
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,370
That has to be a glitch.

2348
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,250
The game said what the game says.

2349
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:01,750
I...

2350
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,410
What are you...

2351
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:07,230
The game said?

2352
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:09,210
What the game?

2353
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:12,670
Oh, you made it somehow.

2354
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:13,430
I made it.

2355
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:18,350
Wait, isn't the hat like somewhere here?

2356
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:20,570
The hat is at the end.

2357
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:22,850
Oh, maybe... Oh, you think so?

2358
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:24,630
Yeah, he says it's at the end.

2359
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:26,370
Oh!

2360
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,790
Why didn't it drop?

2361
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:29,930
It's just floating.

2362
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:32,630
Can you say to bring it to the end?

2363
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:34,030
Oh, I don't know, actually.

2364
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:34,770
Oh.

2365
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:38,250
Wait, what am I doing?

2366
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:39,110
I don't know.

2367
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,490
Oh, oh, oh, block it, block it.

2368
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:43,790
Ah, I'm working on it.

2369
01:37:44,670 --> 01:37:46,890
Oh, close, close.

2370
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:48,410
Okay.

2371
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:49,090
No, oh.

2372
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:50,610
Okay, okay.

2373
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:51,210
Like that.

2374
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,750
There you go.

2375
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:52,550
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2376
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:54,950
It's my controls.

2377
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:56,170
My controls aren't working.

2378
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:57,890
She's playing with tilt controls.

2379
01:37:58,510 --> 01:37:59,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2380
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:01,430
Wait, I think we went...

2381
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:02,070
No, no, no, no, no!

2382
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,410
But I think we went the wrong way.

2383
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:05,410
We left stuff over there.

2384
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:06,110
Yeah, I know.

2385
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,370
I just wanted to...

2386
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:11,190
Grab something, you know?

2387
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:13,910
I wanted to grab something real quick.

2388
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:14,290
Ah!

2389
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:15,890
No!

2390
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:16,150
No!

2391
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:17,930
You...

2392
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:18,850
You...

2393
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:19,350
You...

2394
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:19,890
You...

2395
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:23,730
Very bug.

2396
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:24,490
Very bug.

2397
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:25,270
No, no, no, no.

2398
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:27,290
No!

2399
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:29,190
Oh, dang it!

2400
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:29,970
Oh my god!

2401
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:31,550
Wait, where did it go?

2402
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,710
It went, Barry.

2403
01:38:32,870 --> 01:38:33,790
I think we lost it.

2404
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:35,490
Wait, it went into the water.

2405
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:37,250
Did we lose it?

2406
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,550
I think we lost.

2407
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:44,950
Oh my god.

2408
01:38:45,490 --> 01:38:46,190
Our greed.

2409
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:49,210
Our greed has destroyed us.

2410
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:49,930
It has.

2411
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,530
No, I'll go in for it.

2412
01:38:51,570 --> 01:38:52,870
I'll go in for it.

2413
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,590
Our greed has destroyed us.

2414
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:57,630
Why did this happen?

2415
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:01,990
No, I don't want to live anymore.

2416
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:03,090
I don't want to live anymore.

2417
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:05,170
Maybe a respawn...

2418
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:06,430
Maybe a respawn back here.

2419
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:07,230
Oh, true, true, true.

2420
01:39:09,230 --> 01:39:10,110
No, it didn't.

2421
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:12,150
That was absolute copium, but that's okay.

2422
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:13,850
I was here for it.

2423
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:16,410
Oh, dang it.

2424
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:21,910
Maybe the real moral of the story is that we should work together.

2425
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:25,390
Because if one of us wins, all of us wins.

2426
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:26,490
Uh-huh.

2427
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,830
Why do you sound like that?

2428
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,540
Maybe the real winners wore the hags we thrust it along.

2429
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:50,660
No, that's not.

2430
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,000
What?

2431
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:57,400
Sorry, I have a regular in my chat called Hags We Thrust Along the Way.

2432
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,740
And he used to be called Friends We Made Along the Way.

2433
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,880
But then he got really obsessed with hags.

2434
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,180
And he used to always say maybe the real blank was the friends we made along the way.

2435
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:44,240
But now he's, since he's hags, he always says maybe the real blank was the we thrust it along the way not me one of my chatters you played meat and fuck kingdom i don't want to hear anything from you don't give me that look don't give me that look oh oh oh i think you need to find some little sparkly gem shaped shapes let's find the gems find the gems oh you got it you got Quiz

01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,140
No, I don't trap you.

No.

2444
01:40:58,820 --> 01:40:59,780
I was just kidding.

2445
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,520
You were trying to trap me.

2446
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:01,840
Okay.

2447
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:02,860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

You're okay, stop whining.

01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:23,490
What do you mean?

2459
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,570
You make the same exact noises too.

2460
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:31,070

2462
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:35,630

Oops.

01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:10,950
Don't mind me.

2542
01:45:14,490 --> 01:45:16,210
You were a teleporter.

2543
01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:17,130
If I were a teleporter...

2544
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:18,790
I would.

2545
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:22,750
I would.

2546
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:23,090
I would.

2547
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:25,810
I would.

2548
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:25,990
I would.

2549
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:26,670
I killed a man.

2550
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:28,250
I killed a man and I'll do it again.

2551
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:29,590
I did it twice.

2552
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:32,510
Why did you do such a thing?

2553
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,150
Where's the teleporter?

2554
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:37,150
Is it somehow...

2555
01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:39,090
I don't know.

2556
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:40,870
Oh,

2557
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:46,800
you just said be careful, Barry.

2558
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,040
Oh, I told you.

2559
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:49,560
Oh, I told you.

2560
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,180
Oh, wait, hold on.

2561
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:50,860
Was it me?

2562
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:51,560
Was it me?

2563
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,760
Did you say you'd be careful, Mince?

2564
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,900
Oh, maybe we bugged.

2565
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,500
Maybe we bugged.

2566
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:58,480
Maybe we bugged.

2567
01:45:58,580 --> 01:45:59,580
Can we blow these up?

2568
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:01,460
Oh.

2569
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:02,300
Oh, oh.

2570
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:04,040
Is there...

2571
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:05,840
Is a teleporter over here?

2572
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,840
No, we can't blow them up.

2573
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:09,260
Ah!

2574
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,120
So sad.

2575
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:10,720
It's homing.

2576
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:14,000
I don't think it's homing, but...

2577
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:14,620
Oh, whoopsie.

2578
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:16,060
He just knows where I am.

2579
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:17,300
Oh, you got it.

2580
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:17,600
There you go.

2581
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,080
You got him.

2582
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:18,360
I got it.

2583
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:18,800
I got it.

2584
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:21,560
Okay, okay.

2585
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:23,400
We're both ready.

2586
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,300
He's coming.

2587
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:28,320
Coming.

2588
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,140
How dare you?

2589
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,560
And you're gonna get the yarn.

2590
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,020
And you're gonna get the yarn.

2591
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:40,040
Ah!

2592
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:42,200
Wait, where is it?

2593
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,180
Where, where, where, where, where, where is it?

2594
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:45,360
Where is it, where is it?

2595
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,720
Oh, God, I don't.

2596
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:48,820
Wait, hold on.

2597
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,160
Wait, I mean, wait, I thought we were in this together.

2598
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:52,060
Hold on, come back.

2599
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:53,600
Are we?

2600
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,380
Hold on, hold on.

2601
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:54,680
Are we?

2602
01:46:54,820 --> 01:46:57,640
Wait, I don't know if we can get back up.

2603
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:00,140
Oh yeah, we can do anything we set our minds to.

2604
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:00,840
Oh gosh.

2605
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:01,340
Maybe.

2606
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:02,040
Uh.

2607
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:02,580
Yeah.

2608
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:04,260
Maybe.

2609
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:05,620
Uh, uh.

2610
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,620
Oh, wait, it's not there!

2611
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,320
No!

2612
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:08,960
Vinton!

2613
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:11,580
Yes, yes, me?

2614
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:12,060
Ah!

2615
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2616
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:18,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2617
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:27,000
Wait, wait, wait!

2618
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,180
Wait!

2619
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,760
Oh!

2620
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,400
You said next time I will get it.

2621
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,320
Don't be so.

2622
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:42,480
You killed me.

2623
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:44,400
You killed me, very bad.

2624
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:45,720
You killed me.

2625
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,920
It was just two.

2626
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:51,200
Okay, you can get it next time, I promise.

2627
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:53,700
I promise.

2628
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:54,900
I promise.

2629
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:55,940
I promise.

2630
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:58,360
I don't know.

2631
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:00,560
Oh, wait.

2632
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,740
I should probably have done this.

2633
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,520
Nah, it's okay.

2634
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:03,140
I got it.

2635
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:03,980
Oh.

2636
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,200
Oh, oh.

2637
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,360
Just don't trap me in there.

2638
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,320
I was jumping up.

2639
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:11,660
No, I got the gemmy already.

2640
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,100
Oh.

2641
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:14,080
Oh, it's this guy.

2642
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:15,460
Oh, okay.

2643
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:16,160
Wait.

2644
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:17,880
So he's going to start running.

2645
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:19,480
Go.

2646
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:20,960
Get him, get him, get him, get him.

2647
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,080
Oh.

2648
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,300
Nice.

2649
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,160
Oh.

2650
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:31,280
I guess we don't, we don't, we don't do that.

2651
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,280
You are so close.

2652
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:32,480
Oh.

2653
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:33,980
Oh, oh.

2654
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:34,980
Oh, dang it.

2655
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:38,080
I didn't have to deal with this.

2656
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:38,400
Fine.

2657
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:42,340
And...

2658
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:43,180
Okay, let me...

2659
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:43,780
Lift me!

2660
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:44,620
Lift me!

2661
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,000
I'm getting you!

2662
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:47,240
Be careful.

2663
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,780
Oh wait, we can get...

2664
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:49,520
Pull up more though.

2665
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:50,040
Yeah.

2666
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,160
Or maybe I launch you?

2667
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,060
Launch me.

2668
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,370
Oh, launch me.

2669
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:55,880
Nice!

2670
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:57,260
Oh!

2671
01:48:59,040 --> 01:48:59,320
Oh.

2672
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:00,860
Oh, oh, oh.

2673
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:01,340
I'm good.

2674
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2675
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:03,740
Nice.

2676
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,180
We're fine.

2677
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:04,740
We're fine.

2678
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:05,200
We're fine.

2679
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:05,640
We're fine.

2680
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:06,480
We're fine.

2681
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:08,740
I'll stand here.

2682
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,020
Okay.

2683
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:10,680
Okay.

2684
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,180
Okay, I think that should be good.

2685
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:16,300
Yeah, I think so.

2686
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:17,220
There we go, nice.

2687
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:17,960
Oh my God.

2688
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:18,980
Oh my God.

2689
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:19,720
Oh my God.

2690
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:21,260
Okay, we're fine.

2691
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,000
Okay, we're fine.

2692
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:22,720
This is fine.

2693
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:23,220
This is fine.

2694
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:24,060
Everything is fine.

2695
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,240
Don't stress.

2696
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:25,840
Stop stressing.

2697
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:27,720
I'm not stressing.

2698
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:28,560
You're stressing.

2699
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:29,400
I'm so smooth.

2700
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:30,400
I'm so smooth.

2701
01:49:31,700 --> 01:49:32,860
Someone is trying to kill us.

2702
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,740
Oh, you're right.

2703
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,020
Ah.

2704
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:37,900
Oh.

2705
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,900
I tried to, hold on.

2706
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:42,280
Oh.

2707
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:43,800
Oh.

2708
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,160
Yeah, he has a teleporter behind him.

2709
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:47,900
Ah!

2710
01:49:48,980 --> 01:49:50,260
Okay, what is that?

2711
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:50,680
Oh!

2712
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:51,820
It's a shortcut.

2713
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,900
That's kind of handy.

2714
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,380
Yeah.

2715
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:56,180
Okay.

2716
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:57,760
Uh, throw me.

2717
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,480
Okay, I'm throwing you.

2718
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:00,480
Nice.

2719
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,140
How do I get over there now?

2720
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,180
Um...

2721
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,120
Oh!

2722
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,460
Oh!

2723
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:07,140
Wait.

2724
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:08,020
That way.

2725
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:08,440
I...

2726
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:11,680
Wait, I'll throw you.

2727
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:12,820
Wait, I'll throw you.

2728
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:13,560
Oh, okay, okay.

2729
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,620
Okay, don't miss.

2730
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:19,500
Okay, I'm not missing.

2731
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:22,720
Okay, nice, nice.

2732

There you go.

2733
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,780
Okay, easy peasy.

2734
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,800
We're working together.

2735
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:28,020
I'll hold it.

2736
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:28,400
All right, I'm going.

2737
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:29,220
I'll hold it.

2738
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:30,260
I'm leaving.

2739
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,380
I'm holding it.

2740
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,540
Okay, all right, ready?

2741
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,720
Okay, I think you dropped me.

2742
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,120
Yeah.

2743
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,380
Okay, now you go.

2744
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,240
Nice.

2745
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:39,500
Wait.

2746
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:40,960
Is there anything behind him?

2747
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,200
I was just about to check, yeah.

2748
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,360
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2749
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,580
Nothing behind him.

2750
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:45,580
Okay, we're good.

2751
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:46,020
We're safe.

2752
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:46,760
We're good.

2753
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:48,920
Nice.

Yeah, cover that.

2755
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:50,940
Anything?

2756
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,060
Nothing behind me.

2757
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:53,540
Oh.

2758
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:54,560
Nice!

2759
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:55,940
Gaming?

2760
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:57,760
How do we, uh...

2761
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,220
I guess we throw you, maybe?

2762
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:01,300
Throw me!

2763
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:03,740

Okay, okay.

2768
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:07,700
Wait, I throw you.

2769
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,340
Maybe like up, up, up X.

2770
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,040
Wait, hold on.

2771
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:10,820
Try this side?

2772
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:11,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2773
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:13,960
No, wait.

2774
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:14,980
You might have to...

2775
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:15,620
Up X.

2776
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:16,660
Oh, yeah.

2777
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:17,140
What the heck?

2778
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:18,160
Wait, what is that?

2779
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:18,820
I don't know.

2780
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,780
Oh, I got it.

2781
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:22,840
Oh, nice.

Oh, he says all complete.

2783
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,300
Yeah, he does.

2784
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:27,180
What is that?

2785
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,500
Help, help.

2786
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:32,860
There you go.

2787
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,940
I made it.

2788
01:51:34,220 --> 01:51:35,340
How do I get up there?

2789
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:36,320
Wait, how do you get up there?

2790
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:37,880

Wait.

2795
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:41,660
Okay, yeah!

01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,860
Poo-poo-poo!

2797
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:45,900
Poo-poo!

2798
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:50,360
If there's not another one, I gotta go get some water real quick.

2799
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it sounds good.

Your chat...

2837
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,940
Your whispers are calling me a creep.

2838
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:53,100
Why?

2839
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:54,760
I know.

2840
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,320
I can't believe it.

2841
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:56,860
What'd you do?

2842
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,120
I didn't do anything.

2843
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:00,680
Why would you assume that I did anything?

2844
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:01,240
What'd you do?

2845
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,800
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2846
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:04,400
Why?

01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,320
Oh, no, I didn't mean to go in there!

Oh, I love you.

2860
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,160
We have to lock in because they're timed.

2861
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:32,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2862
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:33,740
Wait, what's this over here?

Okay.

2870
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:43,960
I'll be sure to thank everybody after a while, but thank you.

2874
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:48,680
Oh, God, oh God.

2875
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,020
Oh my God.

2876
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:49,120
Oh, my God.

2877
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,840
I can't tell anything that's happening right now.

2878
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:52,260
Okay, I got us extra time.

2879
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,760
Okay, okay, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

No, not nice, not nice, not nice.

01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:56,340
Is it nice?

2882
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,540
I'm fine.

2883
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,220
Oh, there's the yarn!

2884
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,080
There's the yarn!

2885
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,440
Oh, there's the yarn!

2886
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:02,440
Wait, how do we get that?

2887
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:03,360
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:03,920
Okay, hold on.

01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:05,000
Come, come to me.

Ouch.

2891
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:06,940
Nope.

2892
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:09,040
Who's spitting at us?

2893
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:10,720
Oh.

2894
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:12,180
Got him?

2895
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:12,700
There you go.

01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:13,160
There you go.

2897
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,620
There you go.

2898
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:14,220
Nice.

2899
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:15,520
Nice.

2900
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:16,320
Oh, my God.

2901
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:16,880
Oh, my God.

2902
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,260
Oh, my God.

01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:20,340
Why can't I get through the...

2904
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:20,800
Ah!

There we go.

2906
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:23,780
Okay.

2907
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:25,840
Okay.

2908
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,020
You have to go up here.

2909
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:27,560
Okay.

2910
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,860
And then you have to go through here.

2911
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:29,200
Oh, okay.

2912
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:29,740
Yeah.

2913
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,260
Oh!

01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,560
Okay, don't jump.

2915
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:33,040
Don't jump.

2916
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:34,520

01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:36,320
We made it.

2919
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,460
Oh, don't go.

2920
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,460
Don't jump again.

2921
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:39,460
Yeah, don't stop again.

2922
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,280
Oh, except.

2923
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,300
Okay, nice.

2924
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:43,340
Stop believing.

2925
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:46,020
Okay, okay.

2926
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,120
Hang on to that.

2927
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:50,260
Beel.

2928
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:52,700
Oh, hang on to that.

2929
01:55:57,380 --> 01:55:59,040

Oh my god, stop, please!

2933
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:09,840

2934
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:10,500
Marcy!

2935
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,660
Use my head.

2936
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:15,180
There you go.

2937
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,860
I'll go over here.

2938
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:19,680
Oh, and then maybe...

2939
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:19,900
Oh!

2940
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:21,500
Oh!

2941
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:21,780
Oh!

2942
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:22,660
Oh, dang it!

2943
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:24,140
I did not mean to do...

2944
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:24,580
No, no, no!

2945
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:25,400
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

2946
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:25,800
Okay.

2947
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:26,560
I'm sure it's fine.

2948
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,180
All right.

2949
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:28,700
Oh, oops.

2950
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:32,720
Oh, oh.

2951
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,620
Oh, please, please, let me in.

2952
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:36,900
I got it.

2953
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,000
You got this, Minto.

2954
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:39,100
You got this.

2955
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:39,960
I'll get it.

2956
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:40,880
How'd you get there?

2957
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,740
I just went on the log.

2958
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:43,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

2959
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,160
Whoa!

2960
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:48,560
Whoa!

2961
01:56:49,420 --> 01:56:50,280
What's going on?

2962
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:52,620
Everything's so fast!

2963
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:53,640
Where am I?

2964
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:54,680
Oh, I'm in the water.

2965
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:56,020
What happened?

2966
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:57,880
Hello, girl.

2967
01:56:58,100 --> 01:56:59,160
I am under the water.

2968
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,760
Yeah, the yarn is there.

2969
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:06,220
I don't know if we can...

2970
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:07,080
We think it's so fast.

2971
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:10,800
I don't think we get it right there anyway.

2972
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:12,300
Oh, you think so?

2973
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,460
I don't think so.

2974
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:15,240
Nice, good job.

2975
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,580
Oh, wait, you're right, you're right, you're right.

2976
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:22,400
Okay, then how do we...

2977
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:22,680
How do we?

2978
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,980
Oh, I guess we probably go...

2979
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:24,320
Oh, yeah.

2980
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:25,360
We probably go here.

2981
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,100
Okay.

2982
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:27,820
There is...

2983
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:28,500
Oh, oopsie.

2984
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:28,960
Bye-bye.

2985
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:29,780
There's nothing here.

2986
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:30,380
It's okay.

2987
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,300
Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

2988
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:34,880
It's okay.

2989
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:36,740
That's actually fine.

2990
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,640
Okay, it's actually fine.

2991
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:39,740
Oh, oh, oh, we're stuck.

2992
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:42,220
Okay, they're not going...

2993
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:42,220
Okay.

2994
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,020
We're fine.

2995
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,180
I think there's a...

2996
01:57:46,180 --> 01:57:48,420
There is a secret.

2997
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:49,240
Okay, I got it.

2998
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:49,620
It's okay.

2999
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:50,400
You got it?

3000
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:50,580
Nice.

3001
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:52,520
Why did you spawn there?

3002
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:53,260
I don't know?

3003
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:54,280
The game hates me.

3004
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:56,240
I don't know, the game hates me?

3005
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,260
Wait, I got it!

3006
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:57,400
Wait!

3007
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:58,800
I didn't want to get it without you.

3008
01:57:59,080 --> 01:57:59,380
It's okay.

3009
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:00,160
Just get it, just get it.

3010
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,340
What is that?

3011
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:03,700
It's the key.

3012
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:07,740
It's the... To unlock next the...

3013
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:08,820
Oh my... Oh my God.

3014
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:10,900
We're so tall.

3015
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,660
Yeah, we're so tall.

3016
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,900
I guess maybe we missed a thingy.

3017
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,200
Standing applause!

3018
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:19,100
Yippee!

3019
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:21,380
Chapter complete.

3020
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:23,540
Way to bite the bullet so far.

3021
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:24,280
Hell yeah.

3022
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:30,100
The prison food, which is shopping because that stuff tastes like doo-doo casserole with the side of butt salad.

3023
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:35,340
But rest of all, your riveting performances have the theater bursting at the seams with excited patrons.

3024
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,300
And with all this extra cash you're making.

3025
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,020

We're better than that.

3034
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:13,500
We're better than that.

Oh, yeah.

3040
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:27,900

3041
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:28,660
Oh, okay.

02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,220
That'd be fun.

3093
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:11,400
I'd be curious to see, like...

3094
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:16,160
I think there's, like, that one Japanese flash game where you have to play a guy who's, like, avoiding kisses or something.

3095
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:17,000
What?

3096
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:19,480
Also, wait, there's some more stuff we missed.

3097
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:20,200
Oh, there's a thing there.

3098
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:21,480
Oh, you got it.

3099
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:22,340
Um, there's also...

3100
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:23,560
We didn't go the other way.

3101
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:25,040
I just immediately went through the...

3102
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:25,200
Oops.

3103
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:25,780
I died.

3104
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:27,840
I don't think we can go the other way.

3105
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:28,700
Was there not another way?

3106
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:32,460
No, we started off like that.

3107
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:32,960
Oh, you're right.

3108
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:33,980
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3109
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,340
Okay, blow yourself up.

3110
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:37,020
I will.

3111
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:38,300
Oh, I'll go this way.

3112
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:40,240
Or I'll die and then respawn.

3113
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:42,960
That's the better option.

3114
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,840
More time-efficient option.

3115
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:45,520
Get me up there.

3116
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:46,620
Get me up there.

3117
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:48,880
I'm not pulling all this weight.

3118
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,200
Wait, I think you have to...

3119
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:54,920
Push me!

3120
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:56,500
How?

3121
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:58,180
Push me!

3122
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:58,820
Get over there!

3123
02:03:58,900 --> 02:03:59,420
Get over there!

3124
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:01,820
I think you have to...

3125
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:04,020
Oh, not like that, but I think you have to...

3126
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,040
Okay, this way.

3127
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:07,200
There you go.

3128
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:08,340
Oh, I turned it off.

3129
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:08,760
Oh, okay.

3130
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,520
Oh, you got a...

3131
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:12,160
Oh, you turned it off permanently.

3132
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:12,700
Yeah.

3133
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:13,940
Oh.

3134
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:16,750
Ouch.

3135
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:17,130
Help me.

3136
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,490
Oh my god.

3137
02:04:18,670 --> 02:04:19,470
You go.

3138
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:20,770
Oh.

3139
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:21,850
See?

3140
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:23,270
I'm a team player.

3141
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:24,170
Team player.

3142
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:26,210
Oh, I forgot to...

3143
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:26,370
Oops.

3144
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:27,670
Ah!

3145
02:04:28,030 --> 02:04:29,230
I forgot to...

3146
02:04:29,230 --> 02:04:29,670
Okay.

3147
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:30,570
Here you go, here you go.

3148
02:04:30,610 --> 02:04:30,950
Thank you.

3149
02:04:32,410 --> 02:04:33,290
All right.

3150
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:33,450
Okay.

3151
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,350
All right.

3152
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:36,290
All right.

3153
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:37,870
I'm crawling down like a doll.

3154
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:41,250
Like a damn dog.

3155
02:04:41,410 --> 02:04:42,410
Like a damn dog.

3156
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:44,550
Like a damn dog.

3157
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:46,950
Oh, oopsie.

3158
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:48,270
Don't go that way.

3159
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:50,890
Oh, here I'll let you go.

3160
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:51,670
There you go.

3161
02:04:52,190 --> 02:04:53,210
Oh, dang.

3162
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:54,970
Oh, what is this?

3163
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:56,910
Uh oh.

3164
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:03,500
Easy.

3165
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:08,060
Just complete silence while we were doing that.

3166
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:09,480
Oops.

3167
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:15,720
Oh, you did it.

3168
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:16,800
That was me.

3169
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:17,320
Hey!

3170
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:17,740
Oh, sorry.

3171
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:20,880
I'm trying to get you up there because there's a...

3172
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,320
Oh, there's one on the other side too.

3173
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:23,060
So...

3174
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:23,560
Okay, okay.

3175
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:24,900
And...

3176
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:25,480
Wait.

3177
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:26,540
How do I do it?

3178
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:27,000
Oh, it's X.

3179
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:28,300
Oh, my bad.

3180
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,360
Try again.

3181
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:30,440
Okay.

3182
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:31,080
Okay.

3183
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,200
Wait, but there's like more.

3184
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:34,900
There is?

3185
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:36,780
I feel...

3186
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:38,320
Oh, wait, because we get angel wings.

3187
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:43,690
The thing is over here!

3188
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:45,270
Oh, you got it!

3189
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:45,790
I got it!

3190
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:46,270
I got it.

3191
02:05:46,490 --> 02:05:46,670
I got it.

3192
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:47,190
Okay, nice.

3193
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:49,330
Okay, I'm blowing myself up.

3194
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:51,450
Going?

3195
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:53,310
This, what does this do?

3196
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:55,010
Oh, I have to remove it.

3197
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:55,910
Get off of the thing?

3198
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:56,290
There you go.

3199
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:57,370
Okay, okay.

3200
02:05:57,870 --> 02:05:58,230
Okay.

3201
02:05:58,430 --> 02:05:59,270
Oh, wait, but I...

3202
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:01,890
Now, but now...

3203
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:02,470
I have to get the...

3204
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:03,290
Oh, I think...

3205
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:05,570
Yeah, yeah, I think you have to get rid of it.

3206
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:08,870
Yeah, like that.

3207
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:09,890
You just have to time it.

3208
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:11,250
Easy.

3209
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,310
Easy mode.

3210
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:13,570
Did we get everything?

3211
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:14,030
Okay.

3212
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:15,530
Got the yarn?

3213
02:06:15,790 --> 02:06:16,370
It's seven?

3214
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:18,070
Is there any secrets like up here?

3215
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:21,030
We didn't see any any little.

3216
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:26,090
I think we're good.

3217
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:26,590
I think we're good.

3218
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:27,390
I think so too.

3219
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:28,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3220
02:06:29,670 --> 02:06:31,350
Surely there wouldn't be Week, right?

3221
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:33,630
You think?

3222
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:34,990
I don't think so.

3223
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:36,150
Nah, we're good.

3224
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:37,290
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3225
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:38,870
Tuxedo happy birthday!

3226
02:06:40,190 --> 02:06:41,050
Happy birthday!

3227
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:44,730
Happy birthday, Saiyutai Shots.

3228
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:50,790
I always forget the melody of the Metal Gear ones.

3229
02:06:51,690 --> 02:06:53,330
Have you ever listened to it on your birthday?

3230
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:57,390
I always do, or for the past two years I have, but...

3231
02:06:57,390 --> 02:06:57,790
It's good.

3232
02:06:58,110 --> 02:06:58,530
I just like...

3233
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:01,990
I just am terrible at remembering melodies.

3234
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:03,110
There you go.

3235
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:04,550
Very good.

3236
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:05,930
Happy birthday.

3237
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:06,830
Happy birthday.

3238
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,130
Happy birthday.

3239
02:07:09,190 --> 02:07:09,610
Happy birthday.

3240
02:07:10,510 --> 02:07:10,730
Happy birthday.

3241
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:11,010
Oh, oh.

3242
02:07:11,690 --> 02:07:12,810
Ah, yo!

3243
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:19,330
Oh, hold on.

3244
02:07:19,490 --> 02:07:19,950
I'll shoot him.

3245
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:20,590
I'll shoot him.

3246
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:21,410
Oh, okay.

3247
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:22,690
I think you got him, though.

3248
02:07:22,850 --> 02:07:23,290
You got him.

3249
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:23,750
I did?

3250
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:24,610
Oh, yeah.

3251
02:07:24,610 --> 02:07:26,090
Because he's not standing on it anymore.

3252
02:07:26,690 --> 02:07:26,850
Yeah.

3253
02:07:27,010 --> 02:07:28,590
Wait, but how do we get over the...

3254
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:29,430
Oh, there you go.

3255
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:31,330
I think we just...

3256
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:31,650
Yeah.

3257
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:33,530
Oh, that's it.

3258
02:07:34,590 --> 02:07:34,950
Wait.

3259
02:07:35,190 --> 02:07:35,930
I won't get it.

3260
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:36,250
Wait.

3261
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:36,970
I'll get it.

3262
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:38,510
Actually, launch me, yeah.

3263
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:39,670
Yeah, I'm launching.

3264
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:40,350
Okay.

3265
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,250
Oh, I turned him off.

3266
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:42,090
There you go.

3267
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:42,630
Okay, nice.

3268
02:07:42,810 --> 02:07:44,350
I turn him back on.

3269
02:07:44,510 --> 02:07:45,390
I turn him off.

3270
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:45,790
Oh, wait.

3271
02:07:46,110 --> 02:07:47,190
Wait, what's this over here?

3272
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:48,810
I don't know.

3273
02:07:49,010 --> 02:07:49,590
Oh, wait, wait.

3274
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:50,970
There is some...

3275
02:07:50,970 --> 02:07:51,610
Yeah, there's a gem.

3276
02:07:51,650 --> 02:07:51,970
Oh, wait.

3277
02:07:52,230 --> 02:07:52,630
There...

3278
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:53,850
How do we get this?

3279
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:55,770
Can you stand on my head, maybe?

3280
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:56,730
Yes.

3281
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:57,830
Okay.

3282
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:00,290
And then...

3283
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:00,790
Oh.

3284
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:02,830
Is that...

3285
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:03,710
Uh...

3286
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:04,170
Okay.

3287
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:04,970
Okay, there we go.

3288
02:08:05,090 --> 02:08:05,750
Okay, stay there.

3289
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:06,570
Yeah, I'm saying.

3290
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:07,150
I'm saying.

3291
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:07,670
I'm what?

3292
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:10,170
Oh, there's the bird wings.

3293
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:10,630
There's...

3294
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:10,990
There's a...

3295
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:14,010
Yeah, I think so.

3296
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:14,450
Yeah.

3297
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:15,550
Oopsie.

3298
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:16,510
Uh-oh.

3299
02:08:16,710 --> 02:08:17,010
Bye-bye.

3300
02:08:17,070 --> 02:08:17,530
I got you.

3301
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:18,170
I'm fine.

3302
02:08:19,110 --> 02:08:20,230
I don't need no help.

3303
02:08:21,290 --> 02:08:21,610
Wait.

3304
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:23,650
Oh, thank you.

3305
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:24,290
You're welcome.

3306
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:26,450
No, no.

3307
02:08:26,490 --> 02:08:26,930
Oh, wait, wait.

3308
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:27,630
But there's a...

3309
02:08:27,630 --> 02:08:28,290
I think there's a secret.

3310
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:28,690
Oh, wait.

3311
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:29,110
No, maybe not.

3312
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:29,910
You're gonna get crushed.

3313
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:30,530
Oh, just kidding.

3314
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:30,890
Wait.

3315
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:31,690
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3316
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:33,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3317
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:34,790
Oh, I thought...

3318
02:08:34,790 --> 02:08:36,310
Yeah, I think it's from the bottom.

3319
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:37,450
I think it's from the bottom.

3320
02:08:37,690 --> 02:08:38,010
Oh.

3321
02:08:38,990 --> 02:08:40,530
Well, how do you do it from the bottom?

3322
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:41,590
Oh, the wings.

3323
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:44,540
Red bull.

3324
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:46,140
Gives you wings.

3325
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,640
Oh, give you wings.

3326
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:49,540
I missed all of them.

3327
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:50,460
You did the same thing.

3328
02:08:50,580 --> 02:08:51,580
You did the same thing.

3329
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:53,940
Okay, there we go.

3330
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:55,580
Yeah.

3331
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:56,880
Yeah.

3332
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:59,960
I can't get back up.

3333
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:01,580
Thank you.

3334
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:02,580
Wait, hold on.

3335
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:05,900
Let me try if I go here.

3336
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,520
Oh, big grin, bad.

3337
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:11,820
Oh, my God.

3338
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,420
She is so smart.

3339
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:14,640
I'm so smart.

3340
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,660
How's that for a bugbrain?

3341
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,860
Heck yeah.

3342
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:21,100
Heck yeah.

3343
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,560
She's so smart.

3344
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:23,840
Wait, what's over this way?

3345
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:26,880
I'm so smart and awesome and beautiful and...

3346
02:09:28,740 --> 02:09:30,880
I don't think I can go this way.

3347
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:34,060
Yeah, I think I need to go this way.

3348
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,120
Hmm.

3349
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:39,480
No, because we turned off the thingies.

3350
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:41,280
Do we need the...

3351
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:42,780
No, the wings again maybe?

3352
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:44,600

It's okay.

3356
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:23,400
Worthy sacrifice.

3357
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:24,020
Oops.

3358
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:25,240
Oops.

3359
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:26,360
Why did I jump?

3360
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:29,820
Okay.

3361
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:31,600
Oh.

3362
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:33,120
There's a...

3363
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:34,020
Oh my god.

3364
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,340
That was a crazy scream.

3365
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:37,680
Wait.

3366
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:39,920
I feel like there's something in there.

3367
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:41,300
Yeah, right?

3368
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:45,410
Oh.

3369
02:10:45,850 --> 02:10:46,630
Where did you go?

3370
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:48,230
Oh, oh, oh, I'm down here.

3371
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:49,030
Get him, get him.

3372
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:53,430
Oh, yeah.

3373
02:10:53,550 --> 02:10:54,550
I feel like there's something in here.

3374
02:10:54,570 --> 02:10:54,910
Okay.

3375
02:10:56,350 --> 02:10:57,770
Oh, there's nothing in there.

3376
02:10:58,070 --> 02:10:58,490
No, maybe.

3377
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:00,490
Wait, what was that?

3378
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:02,570
Oh, oh, we got rid of the thing over here.

3379
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:04,410
Yeah, yeah, this was blocking the way up.

3380
02:11:04,650 --> 02:11:05,290
Orange arch.

3381
02:11:07,110 --> 02:11:08,450
Connecting it in my brain.

3382
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:09,110
Oops.

3383
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:11,010
Oh, I should have a lot of guys.

3384
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:12,810
Nice.

3385
02:11:14,310 --> 02:11:14,710
Nice.

3386
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:15,830
Oh, wait, you're on fire.

3387
02:11:15,850 --> 02:11:16,390
I'm also on fire.

3388
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:19,250
It's okay.

3389
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:19,870
It was okay.

3390
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:21,070
Now take it off.

3391
02:11:21,110 --> 02:11:21,350
Yeah.

3392
02:11:22,950 --> 02:11:23,350
Okay.

3393
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:24,430
I think we got one of them.

3394
02:11:24,570 --> 02:11:25,930
I think so too!

3395
02:11:25,930 --> 02:11:26,210
Yippee!

3396
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:27,470
Yippee!

3397
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:32,590
Holy, we're so freaking good at this game.

3398
02:11:32,730 --> 02:11:33,590
This game's so easy.

3399
02:11:34,510 --> 02:11:35,530
Don't look at the time.

3400
02:11:36,250 --> 02:11:39,970
This is my first time playing.

3401
02:11:40,270 --> 02:11:43,590
So it's impossible to speedrun something you've never played before.

3402
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:44,690
Yeah, exactly.

3403
02:11:45,210 --> 02:11:45,910
Yeah, exactly.

3404
02:11:46,390 --> 02:11:47,030
Oh, my bad.

3405
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:48,150
My bad.

3406
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:50,910
I was just checking for any secrets that way.

3407
02:11:51,330 --> 02:11:51,990
Yeah, no, don't worry.

3408
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:52,750
I get it.

3409
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:53,690
Uh, I'm here.

3410
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:54,350
Oh, you got it.

3411
02:11:55,170 --> 02:11:57,770
Oh, we have to go here.

3412
02:11:59,250 --> 02:11:59,570
Nice.

3413
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,410
Oh.

3414
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:06,610
I think, um, maybe I drag it.

3415
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:11,150
I think I can, I can, I can go on your head, I think.

3416
02:12:11,670 --> 02:12:12,350
Come on.

3417
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:16,970
If you, if you, if you put me up there, do like, uh, if you do the...

3418
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:17,790
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3419
02:12:18,850 --> 02:12:20,330
Yeah, do the...

3420
02:12:20,330 --> 02:12:20,790
Oh!

3421
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:22,750
There you go.

3422
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:23,810
Yeah, okay, okay.

3423
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:23,890
Okay.

3424
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:25,330
And then here.

3425
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:27,110
And now you can push it off.

3426
02:12:27,390 --> 02:12:28,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3427
02:12:28,110 --> 02:12:28,690
Oh, true.

3428
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:30,490
Oh, oh, oh.

3429
02:12:30,690 --> 02:12:31,090
Okay.

3430
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:31,570
Now you can get it.

3431
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:33,750
And then you can come here.

3432
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:34,110
I'll come.

3433
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:36,550
Oh, no, I'll come.

3434
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:39,750
No, oh, oh, oh, I can't control this boat.

3435
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:41,110
Oh, wait, don't do that.

3436
02:12:41,370 --> 02:12:41,590
Don't do that.

3437
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:43,690
The boat's made on paper.

3438
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:44,470
Don't do that.

3439
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:45,590
Paper.

3440
02:12:47,070 --> 02:12:49,010
See, we're, we're...

3441
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:49,870
Oh, oops, sorry.

3442
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:50,890
Oh, okay.

3443
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:52,170
One at a time.

3444
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:53,570
One at a time.

3445
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:54,470
Be careful.

3446
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,390
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

3447
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:59,470
Yeah, don't do what I did.

3448
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:00,350
My mistake.

3449
02:13:00,770 --> 02:13:01,690
That don't do that.

3450
02:13:02,190 --> 02:13:02,450
Whoa!

3451
02:13:04,550 --> 02:13:05,470
I got it.

3452
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:06,230
Set it on fire.

3453
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:08,350
Can he die?

3454
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:09,650
Maybe?

3455
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:10,870
Ah!

3456
02:13:11,170 --> 02:13:13,510
Oh, he might be, like, invincible, actually.

3457
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:14,150
I don't think so.

3458
02:13:16,090 --> 02:13:17,010
I'll get it.

3459
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:17,810
I'll get it.

3460
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:18,810
Okay, you got it.

3461
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:19,190
You got it.

3462
02:13:19,190 --> 02:13:19,830
Oh, I see what?

3463
02:13:19,890 --> 02:13:20,410
You got it.

3464
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:21,450
You actually got it.

3465
02:13:23,350 --> 02:13:23,790
Okay.

3466
02:13:23,810 --> 02:13:24,110
There you go.

3467
02:13:24,210 --> 02:13:24,330
Wait.

3468
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:24,990
Oh, thank you.

3469
02:13:27,410 --> 02:13:28,370
Oh, wait.

3470
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:30,590
Oh, oopsie.

3471
02:13:31,690 --> 02:13:32,750
He's used my body.

3472
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:33,590
Nice.

3473
02:13:33,970 --> 02:13:34,850
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3474
02:13:34,990 --> 02:13:37,170
Okay, we did it.

3475
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:38,590
Okay, okay.

3476
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:40,830
Okay.

3477
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:42,230
Okay.

3478
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:44,010
Okay.

3479
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:44,570
Okay, one more time.

3480
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:46,030
Oh, watch out!

3481
02:13:47,650 --> 02:13:48,130
Oh!

3482
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:49,990
Oh!

3483
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:50,210
Oh!

3484
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:52,770
He got me too!

3485
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:53,790
Oh!

3486
02:13:53,810 --> 02:13:55,550
I was pretty fucked up.

3487
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:56,570
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3488
02:13:56,730 --> 02:13:58,030
I didn't even grab on.

3489
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:04,140
I think you got what you wanted.

3490
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:06,840
What did I get?

3491
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:08,900
I don't know anything about that.

3492
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:09,880
Oh, the gem, the gem.

3493
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,120
Yeah, yeah, I got the gemmy.

3494
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:12,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3495
02:14:12,160 --> 02:14:14,680
Just trying to make it.

3496
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:15,320
Oh, my God.

3497
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,500
It's fine.

3498
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:17,860
I'll die.

3499
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,520
There we go.

3500
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:19,300
Yeah.

3501
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:20,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3502
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:25,690
It's fine.

3503
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:26,310
You'll live.

3504
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:28,150
What the heck?

3505
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:30,490
What's up?

3506
02:14:35,310 --> 02:14:36,270
Was that all of them?

3507
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:38,290
Oh, I didn't even need to do that.

3508
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:38,850
What the hell?

3509
02:14:40,330 --> 02:14:41,770
It was the secret!

3510
02:14:42,670 --> 02:14:46,650
You know, Minko, you know what's funny about every time we collab?

3511
02:14:49,090 --> 02:14:54,550
Every time we collab, it's one inch closer to a Roblox collab.

3512
02:14:56,090 --> 02:14:57,570
I'll get you someday.

3513
02:14:57,890 --> 02:14:59,090
How do you figure that?

3514
02:15:00,110 --> 02:15:02,210
The more we hang out, the more we...

3515
02:15:02,230 --> 02:15:08,430
I can brainwash you into being like, oh, maybe the games that Barry recommends are so bad.

3516
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:11,950
And then one day that'll be it'll be like a conditioning.

3517
02:15:12,250 --> 02:15:13,970
Well, this is the first game you've recommended.

3518
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:16,690
That's true.

3519
02:15:17,170 --> 02:15:19,290
But we're slowly getting to it.

3520
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:20,230
Oh my god.

3521
02:15:20,530 --> 02:15:21,790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3522
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:22,770
What's going on in here?

3523
02:15:22,970 --> 02:15:23,590
Oh, whoa, whoa.

3524
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:23,930
I killed.

3525
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:24,550
I killed.

3526
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:26,850
Oh my god.

3527
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,950
Oh my god.

3528
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:30,390
Is there like a secret in here though?

3529
02:15:30,550 --> 02:15:32,130
I feel like there must be.

3530
02:15:32,230 --> 02:15:32,510
right?

3531
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:33,350
Oh my gosh.

3532
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:34,790
Oh wait, everyone's dead now.

3533
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:41,350
Yeah, you think Minto would like dress to impress?

3534
02:15:42,830 --> 02:15:43,270
Maybe.

3535
02:15:44,210 --> 02:15:44,750
Watch out.

3536
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:45,190
Okay.

3537
02:15:46,190 --> 02:15:46,630
Good job.

3538
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:47,730
Oh, dang it.

3539
02:15:49,030 --> 02:15:51,670
Oh, oh, oh, oh, why did I do that?

3540
02:15:52,230 --> 02:15:56,810
To be honest, I feel like Roblox games have gone down in qualities.

3541
02:15:58,030 --> 02:15:58,710
Why do you think that?

3542
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:05,230
Because a lot of them are just a lot of them are just like Like rehashes of, like, popular games.

3543
02:16:05,390 --> 02:16:06,250
Uh, boo.

3544
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:07,770
Yeah.

3545
02:16:09,550 --> 02:16:09,910
Wooa!

3546
02:16:15,070 --> 02:16:15,430
Oops.

3547
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:16,910
Why did she do that?

3548
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:18,210
Why did I do that?

3549
02:16:18,590 --> 02:16:20,250
Why did she do that, you guys?

3550
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:21,110
Oh, I got another gem.

3551
02:16:21,150 --> 02:16:22,770
Oh, okay.

3552
02:16:23,110 --> 02:16:24,270
And I killed a man.

3553
02:16:25,070 --> 02:16:25,810
I'm going to move this.

3554
02:16:25,910 --> 02:16:26,550
You killed a man.

3555
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:28,170
Mama.

3556
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:31,030
I

3557
02:16:34,130 --> 02:16:35,310
want to go, yeah, the other way.

3558
02:16:35,730 --> 02:16:36,850
Oh yeah, there's a yarn.

3559
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:38,810
Get the yarn.

3560
02:16:39,090 --> 02:16:39,970
Get the yarn.

3561
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:41,390
Get the yarn.

3562
02:16:42,370 --> 02:16:43,290
Okay, come over here.

3563
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:43,970
Come here.

3564
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:46,330
Oh, I was so close.

3565
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:46,950
You were close.

3566
02:16:47,070 --> 02:16:47,310
You were close.

3567
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:47,830
I was so close.

3568
02:16:47,970 --> 02:16:48,530
All right, here we go.

3569
02:16:49,190 --> 02:16:49,450
Get it.

3570
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:51,590
Nice.

3571
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:52,450
All right.

3572
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:53,110
A sacrifice.

3573
02:16:54,210 --> 02:16:56,570
Oh, look, I thought it would disappear sooner than it did.

3574
02:16:57,990 --> 02:16:59,710
Wait, did we get everything up here, too?

3575
02:17:00,770 --> 02:17:01,610
I think so.

3576
02:17:02,490 --> 02:17:02,850
Right?

3577
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:03,790
Yeah, I think so.

3578
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:04,270
I think so.

3579
02:17:04,370 --> 02:17:05,310
Why does it give us wings?

3580
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:05,750
then.

3581
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:08,430
Roblox hipster old head.

3582
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:10,230
Hey, I'm not that old.

3583
02:17:11,510 --> 02:17:12,610
Wait, why does it give us wings?

3584
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:14,070
No, no!

3585
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:14,530
Why red?

3586
02:17:14,670 --> 02:17:15,270
Okay, good.

3587
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:17,130
I didn't want to go through.

3588
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:18,650
I thought I wanted to die.

3589
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:19,470
I wanted to die.

3590
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:20,770
I wanted to die.

3591
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:21,690
I wanted to die.

3592
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:23,450
Sweet, you can't say that.

3593
02:17:23,770 --> 02:17:24,590
I'm already dead.

3594
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:25,090
It's fine.

3595
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:29,850
Oh, you need to get the wings and then rush over here because there's a thing.

3596
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:31,650
There's a gem.

3597
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:32,830
Oh, I see it.

3598
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:33,810
Oh, maybe I can get it.

3599
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:34,970
Oh, yeah, I think you can get it.

3600
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,390
Okay, okay.

3601
02:17:36,390 --> 02:17:36,970
Is that every...

3602
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:37,730
Yeah, that's all of them.

3603
02:17:37,970 --> 02:17:38,110
Okay.

3604
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:38,810
Yep, yep, yep.

3605
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:39,710
That's all of them!

3606
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:42,270
I'm fine!

3607
02:17:42,410 --> 02:17:46,290
Back in my day, Roblox used to be freaking awesome.

3608
02:17:47,950 --> 02:17:52,130
Back in my day, we played Second Life and we had no complaints.

3609
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:54,530
What about back rooms?

3610
02:17:55,870 --> 02:17:56,650
Back rooms?

3611
02:17:57,610 --> 02:18:01,930
I think the only game I see people still playing is Dress to Impress, honestly.

3612
02:18:03,210 --> 02:18:03,630
Yeah.

3613
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:04,490
Oops.

3614
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:06,590
I don't know why I did that.

3615
02:18:11,090 --> 02:18:16,510
The only Roblox, like, game that I really like is that, like, there's, like, this one where...

3616
02:18:16,510 --> 02:18:17,210
Oh, nice.

3617
02:18:19,010 --> 02:18:25,990
This team, like, recreated, like, like, Universal Studios, like, almost one-to-one.

3618
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:26,570
What?

3619
02:18:26,810 --> 02:18:27,450
That's crazy.

3620
02:18:28,350 --> 02:18:32,450
Yeah, it has, like, some differences, but it's pretty much, like, Universal Studios.

3621
02:18:33,050 --> 02:18:33,470
What?

3622
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:34,070
That's crazy.

3623
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:36,030
Yeah, like, with narration.

Oh, you're good.

3627
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:09,590
Okay, okay.

3628
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:10,950
Okay.

3629
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:11,510
All right.

3630
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:14,770
Oh, and then I go here and then you go the other way?

3631
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:15,270
Wait.

3632
02:19:15,650 --> 02:19:16,470
Or you go this way?

3633
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:17,430
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3634
02:19:17,710 --> 02:19:18,750
Wait, why can't I?

3635
02:19:20,550 --> 02:19:21,790
Okay, hold on.

3636
02:19:21,870 --> 02:19:23,330
Let me, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming!

3637
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:25,710
Okay, here you go, there you go.

3638
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:28,030
Okay, and then I go here.

3639
02:19:28,410 --> 02:19:29,790
No, no, I don't think.

3640
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:30,530
No, okay.

3641
02:19:30,550 --> 02:19:31,730
I think we just get into the boat.

3642
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:33,070
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

3643
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:33,990
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3644
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:34,210
Watch out.

3645
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:35,030
Whoa!

3646
02:19:35,590 --> 02:19:35,950

Maybe...

3650
02:20:12,870 --> 02:20:15,290
Unless it was telling us to, like, kill him.

3651
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:15,810
I don't know.

3652
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:17,810
Aww.

3653
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:19,130
Like, how...

3654
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:21,770
Like that?

3655
02:20:22,490 --> 02:20:22,630
Like that?

3656
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:22,990
I'm trying...

3657
02:20:22,990 --> 02:20:23,210
Oh.

3658
02:20:23,650 --> 02:20:24,370
Maybe not.

3659
02:20:25,210 --> 02:20:25,550
No?

3660
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:28,410
Maybe not.

3661
02:20:28,530 --> 02:20:29,050
Oh, maybe not.

3662
02:20:29,050 --> 02:20:30,270
But then I can turn off the...

3663
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:31,410
I can turn off the thingy.

3664
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:33,210
I can turn off the...

3665
02:20:33,210 --> 02:20:33,810
Oh, the fat...

3666
02:20:33,810 --> 02:20:34,030
Oh, wait.

3667
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:34,510
I'll die?

3668
02:20:34,630 --> 02:20:35,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3669
02:20:36,570 --> 02:20:37,550
Yeah, turn off this one?

3670
02:20:37,630 --> 02:20:37,790
Okay.

3671
02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:38,810
Oops.

3672
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:39,690
Ha ha ha!

3673
02:20:41,130 --> 02:20:42,690
Oh wait wait wait and then...

3674
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:44,970
And maybe we're overthinking it.

3675
02:20:45,130 --> 02:20:45,510
I don't know.

3676
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:46,350
Maybe we are.

3677
02:20:46,490 --> 02:20:46,630
Wait.

3678
02:20:47,310 --> 02:20:48,270
I don't know.

3679
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:50,750
Why else would it be there?

3680
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:52,510
Yeah, why would it...

3681
02:20:52,510 --> 02:20:54,690
Why would it...

3682
02:20:56,610 --> 02:20:57,990
Guys, are we overthinking it?

3683
02:20:58,130 --> 02:20:59,050
Are we overthinking it?

3684
02:20:59,070 --> 02:21:01,190
Yeah, I think maybe that was the way to like kill him.

3685
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,670
Maybe.

3686
02:21:02,850 --> 02:21:03,250
Yeah.

3687
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:05,610
Yeah, bring it over here.

3688
02:21:05,710 --> 02:21:07,450
Bring it over here, boat man.

3689
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:08,910
Alright.

3690
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:11,730
Okay.

3691
02:21:15,240 --> 02:21:16,540
I keep thinking I'm you.

3692
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:18,680
Oh, I know that happens to me too.

3693
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:20,640
You gotta be different colors.

3694
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,700
Why can't we be different colors?

3695
02:21:22,860 --> 02:21:24,560
Why is there so much noise all of a sudden?

3696
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,240
Oh my gosh.

3697
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:27,480
It's the...

3698
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,700
I gotta go...

3699
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:30,920
How do we do this?

3700
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:32,520
Oh, you did it!

3701
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:33,040
I got it!

3702
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:33,720
I'm dead.

3703
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,760
That's fine.

3704
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:38,020
Wait, what is this?

3705
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:40,960
Oh, like that.

3706
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:41,320
Okay.

3707
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:44,600
Wait, can we, like, kick it back?

3708
02:21:44,840 --> 02:21:44,940
No.

3709
02:21:45,180 --> 02:21:45,280
Ah.

3710
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:46,880
You just...

3711
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,220
Shoot.

3712
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:48,820
Ah.

3713
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:50,600
Oh, dang it.

3714
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:50,860
Nice.

3715
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:51,740
Wait, you almost got it.

3716
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:52,360
I almost had him.

3717
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:53,600
Oh, oh, I got you.

3718
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:53,760
Ah!

3719
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:54,760
My bad.

3720
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:56,260
Why would you do that?

3721
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:56,540
Alright.

3722
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:57,280
Oh!

3723
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:59,420
All right, that was my bad.

3724
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:01,740
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

3725
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,420
Nice, nice.

3726
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:04,600
We kill him.

3727
02:22:04,740 --> 02:22:04,920
Okay.

3728
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:06,680
Kill him.

3729
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:07,540
Okay.

3730
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:08,720
Oh, oh, it fell.

3731
02:22:09,060 --> 02:22:10,280
It's, they have the paper bullet, dude.

3732
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:11,140
I think that's alright.

3733
02:22:11,340 --> 02:22:11,940
Oh, what the hell?

3734
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,440
Oh, I found a secret somehow.

3735
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:15,120
How'd you do that?

3736
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:16,760
I don't know.

3737
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:20,640
I think we just fall through.

3738
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:21,680
Yeah, yeah.

3739
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:22,960
I'm waiting.

3740
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:25,560
Run, run!

3741
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,580
Go, go, go, go, go!

3742
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:40,200
Oh my god, we're all on fire.

3743
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,580
We're all on fire.

3744
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:44,320
A man on fire.

3745
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:45,420
A man on fire.

3746
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,420
Oh my gosh.

3747
02:22:47,420 --> 02:22:48,780
Oh wait, he eats everything.

3748
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,520
Yeah, everything.

3749
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:54,560
Did we get everything?

3750
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:59,300
I don't know, but I can't imagine that we miss anything.

3751
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:01,200
Did we get it all, guys?

3752
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,400
Hey, I think...

3753
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:04,100
No.

3754
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:06,360
No.

3755
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:08,680
I think we can...

3756
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:14,460
Doesn't seem like...

3757
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,340
Oh, well...

3758
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,400
That happened.

3759
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:17,480
Yeah.

3760
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,240
We're done now.

3761
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:20,280
Into the next zone.

3762
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:22,620
Seen clear.

3763
02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:24,740
Hell yeah.

3764
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,100
Dang, we missed one.

3765
02:23:26,300 --> 02:23:27,520
Where was it, though?

3766
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:29,800
Yeah, but we only missed one.

3767
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:32,800
Yeah, sometimes it's seven.

3768
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:34,420
Sometimes it's six.

3769
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:38,060
Sometimes it's...

3770
02:23:39,620 --> 02:23:41,980
Sometimes we just miss everything.

3771
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:42,460
Ah!

3772
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:44,100
Oh, my God.

3773
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:45,560
I kill him.

3774
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:46,260
I kill him.

3775
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:48,720
Oh, oopsie.

3776
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:49,880
He's a pyromaniac.

3777
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:51,740
I love the killing.

3778
02:23:52,620 --> 02:23:53,960
I love to kill you.

3779
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:56,400
Oh, dang it.

3780
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,500
Oh, my God.

3781
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,240
Gosh.

3782
02:23:58,480 --> 02:24:01,500
Do you think there would be a gem nearby for them?

3783
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:08,980
I'm just trying to kill them.

3784
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:10,720
I'm just trying to kill them.

3785
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:12,100
Oh my god.

3786
02:24:12,440 --> 02:24:13,340
This is so bad.

3787
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:14,020
Wait.

3788
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:16,680
I wonder if I change to...

3789
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:19,500
There we go.

3790
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:21,800
Oh, I killed one.

3791
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:22,300
I killed one.

3792
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:22,860
Okay, nice.

3793
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:24,440
Oh my gosh, please.

3794
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:25,900
Oh my gosh.

3795
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:27,020
I just need the...

3796
02:24:27,020 --> 02:24:27,460
There we go.

3797
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:29,100
You know what?

3798
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:29,500
Screw it.

3799
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:30,560
Uh-oh.

3800
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:32,380
I don't think it reaches.

3801
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:35,540
You gotta wait until this comes back and then I'll...

3802
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:36,760
Oh, you got him!

3803
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:39,420
Yeah, I'm sorry, I stole your kill.

3804
02:24:39,620 --> 02:24:40,140
It's okay.

3805
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:42,420
Stolen valor is fine, you know.

3806
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:45,020
I'm sorry.

3807
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:46,520
Was there a gem?

3808
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:47,740
I don't think there's a gem in it.

3809
02:24:47,820 --> 02:24:48,660
No, I don't think so.

3810
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:49,620
I checked the sides.

3811
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:51,560
Oh, here.

3812
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:52,440
I'll jump on my shoulder.

3813
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:53,000
Yeah.

3814
02:24:53,240 --> 02:24:53,280
Yeah.

3815
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:54,280
Okay, thank you.

3816
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:56,040
Okay.

3817
02:24:57,060 --> 02:24:57,280
Okay.

3818
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:00,360
Surely not a secret anywhere.

3819
02:25:00,560 --> 02:25:01,000
Right.

3820
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:01,600
Maybe.

3821
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:02,540
Oh, wait.

3822
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:04,760
Oh, once we go through there.

3823
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:05,600
Oh!

3824
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,260
He won't come this way.

3825
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:11,600
He's coming!

3826
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:12,300
He's coming!

3827
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:14,400
Oopsie!

3828
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:17,540
It's okay, I got the checkpoint.

3829
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:20,460
You might have to run.

3830
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:21,180
Oh god.

3831
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:21,800
Oh he's asleep!

3832
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:22,540
You might have to run.

3833
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:23,660
Oh!

3834
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:27,860
Wait, oh gosh, I can't go that way.

3835
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:28,540
I can't go that way.

3836
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:28,900
Okay.

3837
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:29,620
We're fine.

3838
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:30,340
Nice!

3839
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:31,640
Nice, nice, nice.

3840
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:34,400
Yeah, you're good.

3841
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:35,100
You're good.

3842
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:38,620
Oh, and then we had to save the...

3843
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:40,200
Is there anything up here?

3844
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:41,440
There's gotta be some, yeah.

3845
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:42,980
Whoa.

3846
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:44,600
All right.

3847
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:45,900
Oh, wait.

3848
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:47,760
Oh, dang it.

02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:49,320
It's okay.

3850
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:49,700
It's okay.

3851
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:50,180
Oh, there's a robot.

3852
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:51,880
There's a robot.

3853
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:53,880
Oh, there's a robot.

3854
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:55,180

02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,980

Did you get the thing downstairs?

3861
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:43,520
Was there anything downstairs?

3862
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:44,240
Oh, I think so.

3863
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:45,060

02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:45,620
Okay, okay.

What the hell is?

3867
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:51,380
What the hell is?

3868
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:52,920
Oh, you gotta launch me.

3869
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:53,380
Come here.

3870
02:26:53,940 --> 02:26:56,540
Come here, my bad boy, I'm coming.

3871
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:57,960
I'm coming, I'm ruining something.

3872
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:03,040
Oh, I don't think I can make that.

3873
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:05,540
Or maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I do.

3874
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:07,860
Yeah.

3875
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3876
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:11,380
Oh.

3877
02:27:13,860 --> 02:27:15,480
Okay, and then you do that.

3878
02:27:15,580 --> 02:27:16,420
And then I do that.

3879
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:17,340
And easy.

3880
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:18,700
Yeah, easy.

3881
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:20,380
Crazy, easy.

3882
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:21,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3883
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:22,960
Easy, peasy.

3884
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:24,300
Okay, I'm a little...

3885
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:24,700
Oh, okay.

3886
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:25,420
Oh, we did it.

3887
02:27:25,460 --> 02:27:26,020
That's all of them.

3888
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:28,000
Oh, that's all of them?

3889
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:28,380
Yeah.

3890
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:31,000
The screen, like, does, like, a big, like, brrink.

3891
02:27:31,960 --> 02:27:33,660
Oh, I see what it is.

3892
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:36,260
My ass is blind.

Oh, wait.

3895
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:08,720
I thought it was a sequence.

3896
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,080
One of these has to be, though.

3897
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:12,300
Yeah, right?

3898
02:28:12,420 --> 02:28:13,420
One of them has to be.

3899
02:28:14,940 --> 02:28:16,340
I don't think any of them are.

3900
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:17,360
Okay, just kidding.

3901
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:18,880
Yeah, I don't...

3902
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:21,640
The game is trolling us at this point.

3903
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:26,200
Oh, there's...

3904
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:26,960
Oh, my God.

02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:27,600
Oopsie.

3907
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:30,460
Minto drowned.

3908
02:28:31,420 --> 02:28:31,740
Oh.

3909
02:28:32,460 --> 02:28:32,900
Minto...

3910
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,540
Wow, that's my favorite creepy pasta.

3911
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:36,340

02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:13,600
I guess do we...

3915
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,000
Oh, wait.

3916
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:14,640
You know what?

3917
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:16,560
Maybe it's like, uh...

3918
02:29:17,060 --> 02:29:18,060
No, maybe not.

3919
02:29:19,380 --> 02:29:20,440
I thought it might have been a secret.

3920
02:29:21,220 --> 02:29:21,320
Oh.

3921
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:23,720
No

3922
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:27,780
way all the way back?

3923
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:28,020
Okay.

3924
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:29,280
Alright.

3925
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:29,740
Okay.

3926
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:30,540
I'm here.

3927
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:31,380
Okay.

3928
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:32,240
You got it?

3929
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:33,140
Oh, be careful.

3930
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:33,980
No secret there.

3931
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:34,480
Is there a secret down there?

3932
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:36,080
I feel like there would be, right?

3933
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:37,540
Yeah, right?

3934
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:38,420
Should get the yard?

3935
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,020
Oh, dang it.

3936
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:41,480
I think maybe it's the other way, though.

3937
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:42,080
Maybe.

3938
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:43,080
Oh, toast.

3939
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:43,920
We're getting toast.

3940
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:44,620
Oh, shit.

3941
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:45,160
Oh, shit.

3942
02:29:47,140 --> 02:29:48,020
Oh, shit.

3943
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:48,720
Uh-oh.

3944
02:29:48,880 --> 02:29:49,140
Oh, okay.

3945
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:49,620
It's on your way.

3946
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:51,260
I'm on fire.

3947
02:29:52,680 --> 02:29:53,920
Oh, you were on fire.

3948
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:54,400
You okay?

3949
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:55,760
Yeah, I'm good now.

3950
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:56,680
What is this for, though?

3951
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:57,940
Oh, probably to block.

3952
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:59,440
It was blocking the gem, yeah.

3953
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:00,040
Oh, okay, okay.

3954
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,120
Okay.

3955
02:30:01,380 --> 02:30:01,880
Let's go.

3956
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:04,220
Okay, this might be the secret.

3957
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:04,820
Ooh.

3958
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,080
I think you probably have to wait until...

3959
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:09,280
Wait.

3960
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:10,880
Does that one move or no?

3961
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:18,660
Oh, oh, oh, I think you need to bring the angel wings all the way here.

3962
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:23,240
Oh, wait, where's the angel?

3963
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:24,060
No way.

3964
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:25,580
There's no way you can get through everything.

3965
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:26,080
At the bottom.

3966
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:27,220
Yeah, they're all the way there.

3967
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:29,560
Oh, wait, there's some right here.

3968
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:31,160
Oh, hold on, hold on.

3969
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:31,680
Wait, there is?

3970
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:33,080
Yeah, there's some below you.

3971
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:34,580
Hold on.

3972
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:35,860
Hold on, I'll get it.

3973
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:39,060
Oh, you're right.

3974
02:30:39,640 --> 02:31:10,360

02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:11,820
I don't think I...

3976
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:13,960
I don't think... Did we get everything?

3977
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:17,700
I think it's too late.

3978
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:20,920
I think... I didn't mean... I didn't know the exit was right there.

3979
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:26,420
Shit, it's okay.

3980
02:31:26,960 --> 02:31:27,540
It's okay.

3981
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:29,620
Just one mission.

3982
02:31:30,740 --> 02:31:31,060
Yeah!

3983
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:33,560
Run!

3984
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:37,660
Oh, secret, secret, secret.

3985
02:31:38,900 --> 02:31:39,200
Okay.

3986
02:31:39,640 --> 02:31:41,400
We have to redo it anyways, I think.

3987
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:42,220
Maybe we follow him.

3988
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:43,040
Yeah.

3989
02:31:43,300 --> 02:31:44,400
Oh, oh, you think so?

3990
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:45,520
Or maybe it's like up here.

3991
02:31:45,580 --> 02:31:47,060
He's like kind of in this area.

3992
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:48,020
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3993
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:49,220
There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, yeah.

3994
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:50,360
Oh, oh.

3995
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:51,020
Wait, what the?

3996
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:52,840
Oh, oh, I think I launched you.

3997
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,320
Oh, sorry.

3998
02:31:54,580 --> 02:31:56,380
I don't know what I was thinking.

3999
02:31:57,900 --> 02:31:58,860
Oh, wait, I think.

4000
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:00,180
Okay, okay, I get it.

4001
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:01,040
Okay.

4002
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:02,420
Oh.

4003
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,560
That's close.

4004
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,360
Okay, hold on.

4005
02:32:06,460 --> 02:32:06,820
Peter,

4006
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:13,140
oh, we're under the sea.

4007
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:13,860
Oh.

4008
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:17,760
Wait, this one's weird.

4009
02:32:18,220 --> 02:32:18,840
Where am I?

4010
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:19,800
This one's weird.

4011
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:21,000
This one's weird.

4012
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:22,120
I'm trapped.

4013
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:27,980
Under the sea.

4014
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,900
Under the sea.

4015
02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:31,720
Whoa!

4016
02:32:32,280 --> 02:32:33,600
Gosh, I can't grab anything.

4017
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:34,240
I'm stupid.

4018
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:37,600
Don't say that about yourself.

4019
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:40,320
Don't say that about my best.

4020
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:40,920
Oh, wait, here.

4021
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,980
Maybe I can, like, launch you, or can you, like, get on top of me?

4022
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:44,540
Let me try.

4023
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:47,020
I think I have to go back all the way through.

4024
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:49,460
Like, luckily, it doesn't seem to be...

4025
02:32:49,460 --> 02:32:50,260
Oh, I got it!

4026
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:53,080
Like, like, here, maybe?

4027
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:53,780
Okay, try.

4028
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:54,220
Oh.

4029
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:54,940
Oh, shit.

4030
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:56,980
I think you just have to keep launching yourself.

4031
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:00,000
How do you get up there, though?

4032
02:33:01,460 --> 02:33:02,180
Oh, oh.

4033
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:05,820
Oh, try the other direction.

4034
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:06,260
Wait.

4035
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:07,260
Okay, okay.

4036
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:08,320
Oh, wait.

4037
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:09,340
Maybe you do it.

4038
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:10,560
Wait, I'm doing it.

4039
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:11,280
Okay, there we go.

4040
02:33:11,660 --> 02:33:11,980
Yeah!

4041
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:12,940
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

4042
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,320
Okay, we didn't see the other one now.

4043
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:14,840
Yeah.

4044
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:16,320
Oh, whoopsie.

4045
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:17,240
Oh, God.

4046
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:17,720
Oh, God.

4047
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:20,380
It's kind of nightmare.

4048
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:21,120
What the hell?

4049
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:22,480
I hate this one.

4050
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:25,120
Wait, there's a dev.

4051
02:33:25,240 --> 02:33:26,700
There's the dev in the chat.

4052
02:33:27,940 --> 02:33:28,220
Really?

4053
02:33:28,520 --> 02:33:29,280
Who's the dev?

4054
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,400
Oh, dev in Minto chat.

4055
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:33,220
Oh, hi.

4056
02:33:34,180 --> 02:33:36,000
Wait, I don't...

4057
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Oh, behemoth.

4058
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:38,380
Behemoth!

4059
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:40,320
Oh, behemoth!

4060
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:42,460
Thank you for the gifted memberships.

4061
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:42,880
Thank you.

4062
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:43,600
Thank you.

4063
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:45,860
Oh my gosh!

4064
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:47,620
Thank you, behemoth!

4065
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:50,260
Dude, get off my shoulder.

4066
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:52,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4067
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:53,460
Wait, hold on.

4068
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:55,320
Ah.

4069
02:33:57,400 --> 02:33:59,200
Behemoth, when is the update coming out?

4070
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:04,840
When is the update coming out?

4071
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:05,620
Hi, have fun.

4072
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:06,340
We love you.

4073
02:34:06,520 --> 02:34:07,460
I think I got all of them.

4074
02:34:07,660 --> 02:34:08,400
We love you too.

4075
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:09,040
What the heck?

4076
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:10,500
That was so cute.

4077
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:12,440
Wait, did we get all of them?

4078
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:13,340
Oh, we got the yarn.

4079
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:14,740
Okay.

4080
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:16,720
We got it, baby.

4081
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:17,520
Where's the exit?

4082
02:34:17,580 --> 02:34:18,300
We got it, baby.

4083
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:19,120
We got it, baby.

4084
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:20,520
That's why I come over here.

4085
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:22,080
No, I think that's on the other side.

4086
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:23,080
Yeah, it's your side.

4087
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:24,560
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4088
02:34:25,500 --> 02:34:25,860
Who?

4089
02:34:25,980 --> 02:34:26,340
Who?

4090
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,000
Who?

4091
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:29,680
No, we are patiently waiting for the update.

4092
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:32,920
Thank you for updating this game, despite it being, like, 10 years.

4093
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:34,080
10-plus years.

4094
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:34,760
I know, right?

4095
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,300
Holy moly.

4096
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:36,160
That's crazy.

4097
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,740
That's like a Terraria updating.

4098
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:41,400
Oh, we got it.

4099
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:42,360
We got time, too.

4100
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:42,740
Nice.

4101
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:43,640
Oh, we take it time.

4102
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:44,420
Let's go.

4103
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,040
Oh wait, we did complete it.

4104
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:46,800
But we got a C.

4105
02:34:47,360 --> 02:34:49,620
I think because we didn't complete the actual level level.

4106
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:50,420
Do you want to go back in?

4107
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:50,780
Yeah.

4108
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:51,580
Yeah, we can.

4109
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:52,820
Let's do it.

4110
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:58,100
I just want to say we've been getting perfect scores every time.

4111
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:59,920
Yeah, because we're so good at this game.

4112
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:01,780
You guys should give us our own skins.

4113
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:06,060
Put me in the chat.

4114
02:35:06,860 --> 02:35:07,940
Put me in.

4115
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:08,480
Oh, wait.

4116
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:09,880
Huh?

4117
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:10,520
Wait.

4118
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:11,920
Oh.

4119
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:13,800
I think you need to be here.

4120
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:14,400
Maybe.

4121
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:15,000
Okay.

4122
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:16,640
Okay.

4123
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:21,680
Yeah, because I think they recently put out an update for Castle Crashers.

4124
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:24,320
I didn't need to be here.

4125
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:25,880
I don't think so.

4126
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:28,120
Wait, what is this?

4127
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:29,820
Oh, what is that?

4128
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:32,860
Oh.

4129
02:35:34,140 --> 02:35:34,660
Oh.

4130
02:35:35,180 --> 02:35:36,820
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

4131
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:37,340
Thank you.

4132
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:38,440
Thank you.

4133
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:41,180
I feel bad for ignoring people.

4134
02:35:44,700 --> 02:36:16,330
yeah maybe maybe that's what you guys are into maybe that's why you're donating only during collabs and not during anything else you love being ignored they're just a little you know oh they're just a little freaky like that why did it put me all the way back down here oh wait i'm so curious what is that wrong thing why is there a button here i know what is that That's very strange.

4135
02:36:16,850 --> 02:36:17,490
Oh, I know.

4136
02:36:18,230 --> 02:36:19,990
Oh, don't do it.

4137
02:36:20,050 --> 02:36:20,650
Don't do it.

4138
02:36:20,690 --> 02:36:20,810
Okay.

4139
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:23,910
Oh my gosh.

4140
02:36:24,130 --> 02:36:24,430
Oh my gosh.

4141
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:26,570
Be careful, be careful.

4142
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:28,610
Oh my gosh.

4143
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:32,430
Oh, okay.

4144
02:36:36,930 --> 02:36:39,050
This is one at a time activity.

4145
02:36:39,950 --> 02:36:40,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4146
02:36:40,630 --> 02:36:41,270
Oh, shoot.

4147
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:42,230
Okay, they're not real.

4148
02:36:42,250 --> 02:36:43,910
Have you ever exposed yourself?

4149
02:36:44,330 --> 02:36:45,490
deep dark secret.

4150
02:36:46,270 --> 02:36:47,410
What's my deep dark secret?

4151
02:36:48,290 --> 02:36:49,090
About Laboobus.

4152
02:36:49,830 --> 02:36:50,090
What?

4153
02:36:50,410 --> 02:36:51,910
Oh, that I like Laboobus?

4154
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:53,370
That you like them?

4155
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:55,890
I like Laboobus, but...

4156
02:36:55,890 --> 02:36:57,270
You like Laboobus?

4157
02:36:57,410 --> 02:37:00,990
I kind of want one, but it would be like so cringe to get it now.

4158
02:37:02,530 --> 02:37:04,090
I think you could own it.

4159
02:37:04,130 --> 02:37:05,490
There's no such thing as cringe.

4160
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:06,490
That's true.

4161
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:07,230
Cringe is dead.

4162
02:37:08,230 --> 02:37:09,150
Yeah, cringe is dead.

4163
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:09,670
Wait, there's...

4164
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:10,530
Oh, I found it!

4165
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:11,550
Wait, oh!

4166
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:12,710
Wait, what?

4167
02:37:12,810 --> 02:37:13,950
How do I...

4168
02:37:14,330 --> 02:37:16,710
I said I found it, but I don't know what I found.

4169
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:18,410
Oh, I found it.

4170
02:37:18,650 --> 02:37:20,110
Oh, wait, how did you do that?

4171
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:21,330
Imagine.

4172
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:23,230
Oh, what the heck?

4173
02:37:23,790 --> 02:37:26,010
Oh, oh, I thought I was you.

4174
02:37:28,310 --> 02:37:29,430
Get that guy.

4175
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:30,590
Kill him.

4176
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:32,330
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4177
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:32,870
You killed me.

4178
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:34,070
Oh, wait.

4179
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:35,210
Did the gem die?

4180
02:37:36,750 --> 02:37:38,090
Wait, he ate the gem.

4181
02:37:38,670 --> 02:37:39,470
No, he didn't.

4182
02:37:39,910 --> 02:37:40,510
Oh, no, he didn't.

4183
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:40,790
No, he didn't.

4184
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:41,430
I'm a liar.

4185
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:41,950
He ate me.

4186
02:37:42,990 --> 02:37:44,310
Thank you for your sacrifice.

Okay.

4190
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:17,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4191
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:18,030
I think we didn't notice.

4192
02:38:18,470 --> 02:38:19,570
Ah, we got it.

4193
02:38:21,730 --> 02:38:23,930
Dude, I want to play these, like, old...

4194
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:25,590
Well, not really old, but, like...

4195
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:26,170
You can say old.

4196
02:38:26,310 --> 02:38:26,550
Older.

4197
02:38:28,350 --> 02:38:31,250
Like, these older-type collab games are so fun.

4198
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:32,290
I think they're so iconic.

4199
02:38:32,410 --> 02:38:33,630
This one's so fun, actually.

4200
02:38:34,630 --> 02:38:36,790
Yeah, I really like... It's the style.

4201
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:40,150
Like, you don't really see a lot of indie games with this kind of style no more.

4202
02:38:40,230 --> 02:38:40,550
Yeah.

4203
02:38:41,830 --> 02:38:42,230
Yeah.

4204
02:38:42,650 --> 02:38:43,830
Like, new ground.

4205
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:46,910
They're soulful, they are!

4206
02:38:47,150 --> 02:38:49,770
Hey, Behemoth, did you play the Meat and Bucks series?

4207
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:53,010
Are they still here?

4208
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:53,830
I don't know.

4209
02:38:54,170 --> 02:38:56,570
Imagine they're not here anymore.

4210
02:38:57,630 --> 02:38:58,710
I kind of want to know too.

4211
02:38:58,850 --> 02:39:01,530
I mean, they're probably like old Newgrounds heads, right?

4212
02:39:01,630 --> 02:39:01,970
Right!

4213
02:39:02,730 --> 02:39:03,690
That's like iconic.

4214
02:39:06,730 --> 02:39:07,290
What?

4215
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:14,290
I'm never afraid to...

4216
02:39:14,330 --> 02:40:09,970

4217
02:40:14,830 --> 02:40:17,190
Oh, wait, we try and use this to...

4218
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:19,490
It is not a single linear thing.

4219
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:21,330
Oh.

4220
02:40:27,470 --> 02:40:28,270

Don't be scared.

4223
02:40:31,070 --> 02:40:31,590
Don't be scared.

4224
02:40:31,810 --> 02:40:32,230
I'm scared.

4225
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:39,670
Did you play, like, Henry Sickman and stuff, too?

4226
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:42,730

02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,620

02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:00,540
Is it a date with me?

4232
02:42:00,540 --> 02:42:02,620
Yeah, we're going on a date afterwards, by the way.

4233
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:04,680
We're going to Knotsbury Farm again.

4234
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:05,080
Me!

4235
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:09,340
Now we gotta go to Dollywood, actually.

4236
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:10,580
I heard Dollywood.

4237
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:11,380
Yeah.

4238
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:13,240
Did you see that they're putting in the new ride?

4239
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:15,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4240
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:16,100
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4241
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:17,560
Go ahead.

4242
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:17,960
Sorry.

4243
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:18,820
No, no, no, no.

4244
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:21,640
I saw Dollywood won like a bunch of awards at the theme park.

4245
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:22,080
Yes, yes.

4246
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:55,860
yeah I want to go so bad and they're putting in a new ride that like is right now the technology is only used in this one park in France and it like it allows it so that it can become a roller coaster and a boat ride at the same time wait really yeah so it can like when you're in the boat on the water like it will like physically rock but like it's it's scripted rocking it's not like you know oh yeah it's I can't wait oh my gosh I'm so excited wait I didn't Dollywood was that lit and they put in a new ride.

4247
02:42:56,040 --> 02:43:02,120
That's like a grizzly bear roller coaster and it looks really cute and I want to I want to go.

4248
02:43:02,660 --> 02:43:05,260
Oh What the that sounds lit.

4249
02:43:05,420 --> 02:43:07,460
Yeah, I heard Dollywood is like really good.

4250
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:08,540
Let's go to Dollywood.

4251
02:43:08,760 --> 02:43:09,380
Let's go to Dollywood.

4252
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,500
Let's go to Dollywood.

4253
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,820
I want to go.

4254
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:13,900
I want to go.

4255
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:16,220
Yeah It's cool.

4256
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:34,980
Like there's like this little lever on the like this mechanism on the bottom of the boat goes in the water it extends and then when it goes back on land it like compresses so like it's closer to the track and then in the water it like turns into a boat and then on out of the water it turns into a roller coaster.

4257
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:36,660
It's so cool.

4258
02:43:36,660 --> 02:43:39,700
I can't even imagine what that is, what that's like.

4259
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:40,380
What the heck?

4260
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:42,380
I know I want to try riding it so bad.

4261
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:50,860
I was really impressed by the, I mean it was short but I really did like the Knotsbury Farm like the pony express.

4262
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:52,440
Yeah, it was so short.

4263
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:53,260
It was interesting.

4264
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:54,400
It was so cool, yeah.

4265
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:55,860
Yeah, it was very interesting.

4266
02:43:55,960 --> 02:44:01,740
I really like rides that are not, like, the typical where you ride, you, like, just sit down and...

4267
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:02,820
Except the mouse trap.

4268
02:44:03,880 --> 02:44:06,000
Oh, my God, the mouse...

4269
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:09,680
I don't think it was even called mouse trap, but there was this one ride and...

4270
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:15,260
There was this one ride in Knotsbury Farm that had, like, an insane, like, whiplash.

4271
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:17,120
Like...

4272
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:19,520
You guys know the game, like, the board game Mouse Trap?

4273
02:44:19,700 --> 02:44:20,780
It was just like that.

4274
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:23,180
And so we kept calling it mouse trap.

4275
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:25,700
Yeah, it was like completely flat.

4276
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,620
Or it was flatter than you'd expect.

4277
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,980
And it was just turns and being flat.

4278
02:44:30,460 --> 02:44:32,900
And it was so violent.

4279
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:34,380
It really hurt.

4280
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:36,220
Yeah?

4281
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:38,160
Yeah?

4282
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:39,480
Yeah?

4283
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:42,180
Oh my god.

4284
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:44,320
Yeah, it was...

4285
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:45,300
Mouse hunt?

4286
02:44:45,980 --> 02:44:46,600
Wild mouse?

4287
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:47,500
Oh wait, what are those?

4288
02:44:47,620 --> 02:44:48,020
Yeah, wow.

4289
02:44:48,660 --> 02:44:50,760
There's like another ride that's like that.

4290
02:44:50,780 --> 02:45:22,980
I think it's like from I don't know actually I know Disney has a variation I think it's like Goofy's air ride Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I imagine that one probably is like the same so terrible Yeah and it was also backed up for some reason so we like stayed for like Oh we were burning in the sun for like 15 minutes Yeah like the ride Like the ride had already ended but there was a line to get off so we were just stuck in the cart like For like five minutes in the sun,

4291
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:23,920
just baking.

4292
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:25,420
So bad.

4293
02:45:26,060 --> 02:45:29,540
But also the worst part was like the lap bars.

4294
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:30,680
They would come down.

4295
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:35,560
But there was also like another lap bar by your shins.

4296
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:37,600
That was just like...

4297
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:42,680
So we all had like marks on our shins after we got off.

4298
02:45:42,760 --> 02:45:43,860
It was like...

4299
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:45,660
It was so bad.

4300
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,360
If you're tall, you would have a bad time.

4301
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:49,440
Yeah.

4302
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:56,800
Most fun, though, was definitely the Snoopy ride that we went on where we were, like, the only adults without children.

4303
02:45:58,300 --> 02:46:00,860
And they wouldn't let us two to a car.

4304
02:46:01,100 --> 02:46:01,820
It was only one.

4305
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:03,820
So we took up, like, half the food.

4306
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:13,520
Yeah, we, we, like, made, we, we, like, we, like, did not let the kids, like, go in the front where Snoopy was.

4307
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:18,020
Like, where the big, uh, Snoopy, like, um, uh, what's it called?

4308
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:48,680
mascot was like mint was at the very front yeah i showed my chat a picture of it i was like that's me sitting right behind snoopy who's driving the car we were like all screaming like freaking like we were very obnoxious about it okay but notsbury has like a like a number system of like how intense a ride is right and so we were like oh my gosh this one is a four out of five Why?

4309
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:51,440
It was intense, you know?

4310
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:54,180
You just get so excited seeing Snoopy and Woodstock.

4311
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:54,820
I did.

4312
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:55,960
I did get really excited.

4313
02:46:56,420 --> 02:46:56,420
Yeah.

4314
02:46:56,620 --> 02:46:57,800
We all got so excited.

4315
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:03,820
I'm glad that the, because before we went on, the operator guy kept letting everyone go twice.

4316
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:05,480
And he was like, one more time.

4317
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:07,660
So I was like, oh man, we're like all adults.

4318
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:09,120
I wonder if he's going to do that for us.

4319
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:09,900
But he did.

4320
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:10,840
We were like cheering.

4321
02:47:11,180 --> 02:47:12,280
I think it's like a scripted part of the ride.

4322
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:13,540
But it's so good.

4323
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:15,140
It's so good.

4324
02:47:16,080 --> 02:47:18,000
Extend the ride so you can get to go.

4325
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:20,140
What other brides do that?

4326
02:47:20,460 --> 02:47:22,520
Unless it's, like, you know, end of the night or something.

4327
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:25,560
I mean, we did technically go at the end of the night.

4328
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:27,020
That's true.

4329
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:27,600
Yeah.

4330
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:28,400
Mm-hmm.

4331
02:47:29,080 --> 02:47:29,740
It was so fun.

4332
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:32,560
Are you going to go back for Not Scary Farm?

4333
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:33,660
I actually don't know.

4334
02:47:33,860 --> 02:47:34,780
Do they have, like, walking?

4335
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:39,360
Like, I know Six Flags has, have, have people, like, walking around in costumes.

4336
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:44,520
I, I, I, the Universal ones get crazier and crazier every year.

4337
02:47:44,660 --> 02:47:45,060
Oh, really?

4338
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:45,460
Yeah.

4339
02:47:45,460 --> 02:47:47,120
I've never been to Universal Studios.

4340
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:47,820
I want to go.

4341
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:49,120
You never been at all?

4342
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:50,620
No, not at all.

4343
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:53,320
Well, maybe I went, like, maybe when I was younger.

4344
02:47:54,280 --> 02:47:58,120
Because I remember, like, the Homer Simpson donut ride when I was really young.

4345
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:59,900
But I didn't really understand what it was.

4346
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:03,960
But I've never been there, like...

4347
02:48:03,960 --> 02:48:05,080
Yeah, I've never been there.

4348
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:08,460
Well, we could go to Dollywood and then go to Universal.

4349
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:09,880
Yeah, in the same day.

4350
02:48:09,900 --> 02:48:10,900
In the same day.

4351
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:16,000
Whereas Dollywood is Tennessee, right?

4352
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:17,360
Tennessee, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4353
02:48:18,460 --> 02:48:19,440
We gotta go.

4354
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:21,060
We're putting it down, yeah.

4355
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:22,160
Mark it down.

4356
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:22,840
Dollywood.

4357
02:48:22,880 --> 02:48:25,060
We gotta go with the theme park with those.

4358
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:28,500
We gotta get Ashton too, because I don't want to go like...

4359
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:30,700
Oh my gosh, we gotta go.

4360
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:32,360
Bush Gardens?

4361
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:33,940
I've never been to Bush Gardens either.

4362
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:35,020
It's a...

4363
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:37,040
Actually, I only know the Florida one.

4364
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:37,980
I don't know if there's another one.

4365
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:42,200
We have to go to the epic universe though.

4366
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:42,620
Yeah!

4367
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,080
It looks so good.

4368
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:48,000
If we did like a couple days for Universal, I think it'd be better.

4369
02:48:48,020 --> 02:49:21,000
perfect oh yeah i guess universal is big enough now that that you should like set aside a couple of days oh i mean like maybe just well like one actually i don't know one day for universal one day for like the parks with like velociraptor and things like that velocicoaster and then one day for epic i guess so three days maybe right yeah because they're different lands i guess Wow,

4370
02:49:21,700 --> 02:49:45,940
sounds like fun Yeah, I don't think I want to go to Disney anytime soon Because it's so expensive nowadays Oh my god, American Disney is so expensive Yeah Yeah, I really like I really liked going to Tokyo Disney But My thing was that It pissed me off Because I haven't been to Disney World that much But I've been enough times to know that they were speeding up the damn rides Really?

4371
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:52,620
Oh, some of them are crazy, yeah Yeah, if there's like enough people, I guess, they like start speeding up the ride.

4372
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:54,920
So I remember like going on Peter Pan's flight.

4373
02:49:55,260 --> 02:50:00,760
And to be fair, the wait time was very, like it was like 40 minutes or something, like really short for Peter Pan's flight.

4374
02:50:01,220 --> 02:50:03,240
But it was like a minute long.

4375
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:05,420
Yeah, because it's so popular.

4376
02:50:06,980 --> 02:50:07,460
Oh my god.

4377
02:50:07,860 --> 02:50:07,960
Yeah.

4378
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:10,600
But they were speeding up the damn rides and I was like, what the freak?

4379
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:16,180
The Snow White ride and the Pinocchio ride are like nonsensical because they're so fast.

4380
02:50:16,240 --> 02:50:17,020
You can't tell at all.

4381
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:21,940
It's like a thrill ride at that point.

4382
02:50:22,820 --> 02:50:23,680
Oh my goodness.

4383
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:24,460
Yeah.

4384
02:50:25,100 --> 02:50:25,700
It's fun.

4385
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:26,880
Yeah.

4386
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:37,300
I really, I was really confused by, because I've never really looked into Tokyo Disneyland, but I was really confused by, because my mom got this tour guide, or like a tour book.

4387
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:44,300
And the tour book was like, oh yeah, the two most famous attractions here are the Beauty and the Beast ride, of course, right?

4388
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:45,740
And the Baymax ride.

4389
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:46,880
And I was like, oh, yeah.

4390
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:47,600
Baymax ride.

4391
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:54,240
Yeah, I was like, and I looked at it, or like we went online, or we looked at the line, and it was like two hours long.

4392
02:50:54,660 --> 02:51:03,340
It's always, it's always insane, the Baymax ride, because they just go nuts over him, and they go nuts over doing, like, the dances on the ride.

4393
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:07,620
It's so, and I looked at it, I was like, that doesn't seem like a, like a thrill ride.

4394
02:51:07,720 --> 02:51:08,840
Why is it so long?

4395
02:51:09,020 --> 02:51:11,080
They love it, they love it for some reason.

4396
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:13,200
Yeah, they know, like, the dances and stuff.

4397
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:18,280
Yeah, I've never been on it, because it's always been so long, and I I'm like, is it worth?

4398
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:23,380
Yeah, I feel like it's just like a you probably just have to know the dance moves and stuff.

4399
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:25,940
Like, it's just a concert type thing.

4400
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:27,480
But I was very confused.

4401
02:51:27,760 --> 02:51:28,480
It was very weird.

4402
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:30,820
Yeah, it's kind of funny though, that they're like...

4403
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,800
But the Beauty and the Beast ride is definitely worth.

4404
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:35,360
Yeah, dude, I almost started crying.

4405
02:51:35,580 --> 02:51:36,800
I cried on that ride.

4406
02:51:36,900 --> 02:51:39,840
The first time I went on it, I was like, this is so beautiful.

4407
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:41,240
I know.

4408
02:51:41,500 --> 02:51:46,460
I was almost... I almost cried, but they sat us next to, like, this little kid.

4409
02:51:48,380 --> 02:51:52,780
And I was like, I can't cry in front of this, like, small child.

4410
02:51:55,660 --> 02:51:59,040
Next time I go back to Japan, I'm going to try Fantasy Springs.

4411
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,440
Oh, yeah, that's like, I don't even know what that is.

4412
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:05,560
It's just like, it's not like Disney Springs, right?

4413
02:52:05,660 --> 02:52:06,840
It's like a different thing.

4414
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:09,040
It's just an extension of Disney Sea.

4415
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:14,840
So, like, they added Frozen, Rapunzel, and Peter Pan, I think.

4416
02:52:15,380 --> 02:52:16,840
Oh, yeah, I want to go to Disney.

4417
02:52:16,860 --> 02:52:18,140
Disney Sea sometime.

4418
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:19,760
Come with me to Disney Sea.

4419
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:20,660
Come with me to Disney Sea.

4420
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:20,840
I will go.

4421
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:22,600
I will go.

4422
02:52:22,660 --> 02:52:22,740
I will go.

4423
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:23,020
Oh my gosh.

4424
02:52:23,220 --> 02:52:27,640
You have to ride, you have to ride the Journey to the Sound of the Earth ride.

4425
02:52:27,900 --> 02:52:29,780
I will force you on that ride.

4426
02:52:30,420 --> 02:52:32,460
That's the, that's the one with the song, right?

4427
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:33,520
Song?

4428
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:38,140
I think there's like a song associated with that right.

4429
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:46,260
I know it because, you know, Disney, Disney Japan always puts out that thing where it's like Kōe no Oji-oji-sama?

4430
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:47,400
I don't know.

4431
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:48,040
Oji-sama.

4432
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:53,080
It's this thing where they get, like, a bunch of male sayus to sing a bunch of Disney songs.

4433
02:52:54,640 --> 02:53:00,860
And I remember there was just one song that I didn't recognize that Junichi Sawabe sang.

4434
02:53:01,460 --> 02:53:02,800
And I was like, what the fuck is this song?

4435
02:53:02,860 --> 02:53:03,700
This is not Disney.

4436
02:53:03,880 --> 02:53:05,680
And I looked it up, and apparently it was from Disney Sea.

4437
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:07,120
It was, like, from one of the rides there.

4438
02:53:08,300 --> 02:53:08,660
Yeah.

4439
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:10,260
I didn't know that at all.

4440
02:53:10,320 --> 02:53:11,220
I learned today.

4441
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:12,400
Yeah.

4442
02:53:12,580 --> 02:53:14,200
Koei no oji-sama.

4443
02:53:14,440 --> 02:53:15,620
Koei no oji-sama, okay.

4444
02:53:16,860 --> 02:53:17,640
I really like it.

4445
02:53:17,720 --> 02:53:18,960
I think it's super cute.

4446
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:21,120
I like hearing Deku sing Coco.

4447
02:53:25,320 --> 02:53:27,000
He's like, remember me.

4448
02:53:30,780 --> 02:53:32,100
And he's like dressed though.

4449
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:35,760
I know they make them perform it live at a concert too.

4450
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:40,820
I love seeing my like middle age say you like fucking go up on stage.

4451
02:53:42,520 --> 02:53:43,420
That's so cute.

4452
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:46,780
Perform the Disney song.

4453
02:53:47,960 --> 02:53:50,260
My special interests are colliding.

4454
02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:52,700
It's so awesome.

4455
02:53:52,860 --> 02:54:03,500
They had like, um, uh, Midori Kawa Hikaru and, I forgot his name, but Gilgamesh's voice actor sing Beauty and the Beast together, like, duet.

4456
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:05,300
It's so fucking funny.

4457
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:06,640
I really like it.

4458
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:08,800
This is so good.

4459
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:10,440
Yeah.

4460
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:12,380
Okay, we'll go to Disney City.

4461
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,920
We'll go to all the theme parks together.

4462
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:16,060
Yeah, we'll do it.

4463
02:54:16,180 --> 02:54:16,840
It'll be so much fun.

4464
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:17,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4465
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:18,580
Yeah, yeah.

4466
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:19,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4467
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:30,080
It's okay.

4468
02:54:30,500 --> 02:54:40,740
Have you heard, like, I don't know, I've never heard, like, I never, I guess I never listened to that song like, properly, and then I listened to it and like, Donald Duck is like screaming in the background.

4469
02:54:41,480 --> 02:54:43,780
Yeah, he gets like mad he's like, Donald Duck!

4470
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:44,180
Yeah.

Oh my gosh, I grabbed it!

Skill issue, for real?

4475
02:55:20,320 --> 02:55:20,460
Okay.

4476
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:23,120
Okay, no skill issue.

4477
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:24,140
No skill, oh.

4478
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:25,880
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4479
02:55:25,900 --> 02:55:26,600
I didn't even go up there.

4480
02:55:26,680 --> 02:55:27,620
The ball of yarn is up there.

4481
02:55:28,860 --> 02:55:30,200
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4482
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:31,180
Okay, how do you...

4483
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:31,980
Oh, I see.

4484
02:55:32,240 --> 02:55:33,400
Oh, you actually get rid of him.

4485
02:55:33,400 --> 02:55:34,900
This thing is so dang fast.

4486
02:55:34,980 --> 02:55:35,880
It's, like, so hard.

4487
02:55:35,940 --> 02:55:36,660
Okay, I got rid of him.

4488
02:55:36,940 --> 02:55:37,660
Oh, God, oh, God.

4489
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:38,600
I got rid of him for you.

4490
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:39,640
Okay, okay, okay.

4491
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:40,280
I'm going.

4492
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:40,680
I'm going.

4493
02:55:40,780 --> 02:55:41,120
Okay, wait.

4494
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:41,480
I'm dying.

4495
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:41,940
I'm dying.

4496
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:42,600
You got this?

4497
02:55:43,240 --> 02:55:43,560
Okay.

4498
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:46,000
I think you need to go back down and get the jetpack.

4499
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:46,440
I'm going.

4500
02:55:46,620 --> 02:55:46,920
I'm going.

4501
02:55:49,500 --> 02:55:49,620
Okay.

4502
02:55:50,100 --> 02:55:50,180
Nice.

4503
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:52,180
Come back to me, Berrybug.

4504
02:55:52,820 --> 02:55:54,880
Oh, I'm coming soon.

4505
02:55:55,960 --> 02:55:56,600
Okay, there we go.

4506
02:55:57,060 --> 02:55:57,400
She's coming.

4507
02:55:57,540 --> 02:55:57,840
She's coming.

4508
02:55:59,200 --> 02:55:59,780
Not like that.

4509
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:00,400
Not like that.

4510
02:56:01,940 --> 02:56:03,460
I'm not in Meat and Bug Kingdom.

4511
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:05,940
Oh, how did that kill you?

4512
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:06,940
I don't know.

4513
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:07,820
Oopsie.

4514
02:56:07,980 --> 02:56:08,380
Uh-oh.

4515
02:56:10,180 --> 02:56:11,120
Okay, you made it.

4516
02:56:11,220 --> 02:56:11,580
Nice.

Alright, don't double jump there, don't double jump there.

4524
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:27,680
Oh, oh, I thought I was you, fuck.

4526
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:31,920
What is this?

4527
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:34,320

4528
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:35,500
Oh, yeah, there you go, nice.

4529
02:56:35,800 --> 02:56:36,520
Go get the journey.

4530
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:39,400
There's a teleporter right here.

4531
02:56:40,380 --> 02:56:40,740
Yeah.

4532
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:41,980

How does that work?

4536
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:48,140
What does that do?

4537
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:50,440
Is there like a sailboat that we need?

4538
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:52,080
Uh-oh.

4539
02:56:52,220 --> 02:56:52,940
Our time.

4540
02:56:53,720 --> 02:56:54,720
Uh-oh, we're lost.

4541
02:56:55,140 --> 02:56:56,060

4542
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:58,440

Go through the teleporter!

4544
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:00,880

02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:05,500
Okay, I move this and then I go...

02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:06,100
Other way, other way.

4549
02:57:06,540 --> 02:57:06,820
What?

4550
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:08,180
What do you mean other way?

4551
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:10,260
Other way, other way so I can go there.

4552
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:11,760
Okay, just keep going, just keep going.

4553
02:57:11,860 --> 02:57:12,680

It's okay, we know what to do now.

4563
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:34,420
Oh, oops.

4564
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:36,920
You're distracted, it's okay.

Oh, I just kept walking.

4567
02:57:39,220 --> 02:57:41,300
Oh, why do I- why does it spawn me there?

4568
02:57:43,660 --> 02:57:45,120
Why does it spawn me there?

4569
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:45,820

4570
02:57:46,140 --> 02:57:46,760

Don't say that!

4575
02:57:54,100 --> 02:57:55,240
Don't say that!

4576
02:57:55,940 --> 02:57:58,460
Okay, I'll go here, you wait over there, I guess.

The key's right there.

4700
03:02:13,170 --> 03:02:13,950
The key's right there.

4701
03:02:14,310 --> 03:02:14,730
Okay, okay.

4702
03:02:15,050 --> 03:02:15,190
Go!

4703
03:02:15,450 --> 03:02:15,490
Go!

4704
03:02:15,710 --> 03:02:15,710
Get him!

4705
03:02:16,270 --> 03:02:16,650
Get him!

4706
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:20,140
Ah!

4707
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:23,970
Okay.

4708
03:02:24,450 --> 03:02:25,410
It's okay, we know what to do.

4709
03:02:25,550 --> 03:02:25,770
Yeah.

4710
03:02:25,970 --> 03:02:27,670
This one's like strange though.

4711
03:02:28,470 --> 03:02:28,910
Okay.

4712
03:02:29,310 --> 03:02:30,750
Do you want me to go through it?

4713
03:02:32,170 --> 03:02:33,390
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4714
03:02:33,610 --> 03:02:35,210
Or here, you can do it.

4715
03:02:35,870 --> 03:02:36,890
already know the pattern.

4716
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:37,030
I'm going.

4717
03:02:37,190 --> 03:02:37,450
I'm going.

4718
03:02:37,610 --> 03:02:38,390
You know everything.

4719
03:02:38,930 --> 03:02:38,930
Oh.

4720
03:02:40,450 --> 03:02:41,710
You got this.

4721
03:02:44,150 --> 03:02:44,450
Nice.

4722
03:02:45,750 --> 03:02:47,210
She's gaming, everybody.

4723
03:02:47,710 --> 03:02:47,930
Okay.

4724
03:02:48,330 --> 03:02:49,230
What about that gemmy?

4725
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:49,870
I got it here.

4726
03:02:50,810 --> 03:02:50,990
Yep.

4727
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:52,870
Okay.

4728
03:02:53,130 --> 03:02:53,210
Okay.

4729
03:02:53,470 --> 03:02:53,990
Nice.

4730
03:02:54,950 --> 03:02:55,470
Okay.

4731
03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:57,350
I feel like that's not the intended way.

4732
03:02:57,490 --> 03:02:57,790
I don't know.

4733
03:02:57,970 --> 03:03:00,950
I don't think so, but who cares?

4734
03:03:01,610 --> 03:03:03,110
Who cares, I guess?

4735
03:03:03,310 --> 03:03:04,490
Who cares?

4736
03:03:04,490 --> 03:03:05,010
Oh, that's fine.

4737
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:08,190
Okay.

4738
03:03:08,610 --> 03:03:08,930
Okay.

4739
03:03:08,930 --> 03:03:09,490
Got us more time.

4740
03:03:09,510 --> 03:03:09,890
Good night.

4741
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:10,970
Okay.

4742
03:03:11,370 --> 03:03:12,270
Okay, okay, okay.

4743
03:03:13,610 --> 03:03:14,010
Okay.

4744
03:03:14,290 --> 03:03:14,370
Oh.

4745
03:03:14,830 --> 03:03:15,530
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4746
03:03:16,050 --> 03:03:17,090
Uh, uh.

4747
03:03:17,710 --> 03:03:19,290
How did you, did you kill him last time?

4748
03:03:19,350 --> 03:03:21,010
I guess I did, but I don't know how.

4749
03:03:22,270 --> 03:03:22,690
Um.

4750
03:03:24,690 --> 03:03:25,130
Yeah!

4751
03:03:25,890 --> 03:03:26,310
There we go.

4752
03:03:26,630 --> 03:03:26,950
All right.

4753
03:03:27,570 --> 03:03:27,930
Okay.

4754
03:03:28,490 --> 03:03:29,350
Oh, dang it.

4755
03:03:29,370 --> 03:03:30,030
Oh my gosh.

4756
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:32,510
Oh.

4757
03:03:32,670 --> 03:03:33,490
Oh, oh, oh.

4758
03:03:33,790 --> 03:03:34,230
Oh.

4759
03:03:34,730 --> 03:03:35,550
Oh, oh, oh.

4760
03:03:35,590 --> 03:03:35,850
Oh.

4761
03:03:35,870 --> 03:03:37,630
Oh, oh, oh.

4762
03:03:38,770 --> 03:03:40,130
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4763
03:03:40,190 --> 03:03:40,890
Ah, dang it!

4764
03:03:41,850 --> 03:03:43,650
What, no, hat this time, Stampy?

4765
03:03:45,050 --> 03:03:45,850
Yeah, Stingy!

4766
03:03:46,750 --> 03:03:47,930
You're stingy, man.

4767
03:03:49,010 --> 03:03:49,450
What the hell?

4768
03:03:49,530 --> 03:03:50,930
That guy's actually stingy.

4769
03:03:51,650 --> 03:03:52,930
None this time!

4770
03:03:53,390 --> 03:03:53,630
Alright.

4771
03:03:54,930 --> 03:03:55,890
Oh, dang it.

4772
03:03:57,250 --> 03:03:59,190
Oh my gosh, how are you supposed to get this far?

4773
03:03:59,270 --> 03:04:00,710
I think you have to distract him over here, no?

4774
03:04:01,410 --> 03:04:02,430
Oh, yeah, probably.

4775
03:04:03,090 --> 03:04:03,910
Oh, dang it!

4776
03:04:04,490 --> 03:04:04,890
Okay.

4777
03:04:05,070 --> 03:04:05,850
Hello, hello, sir.

4778
03:04:05,870 --> 03:04:07,750
Hello, okay, I think he's focused on me.

4779
03:04:07,950 --> 03:04:08,670
No, he's not.

4780
03:04:08,670 --> 03:04:09,510
Go get it.

4781
03:04:09,570 --> 03:04:09,990
Okay, nice

4782
03:04:13,370 --> 03:04:20,130
Your legs your legs your legs I'm one inch taller than you

4783
03:04:26,550 --> 03:04:33,810
You've really got the crowd eating from your delicate hands now there's never a dull moment with you at the helm Except for maybe like twice, but I gotta hand it to you.

4784
03:04:33,990 --> 03:04:37,610
You've got quite the unbreakable spirit I mean, I'm not nearly as brave as you.

4785
03:04:37,790 --> 03:04:42,430
If I was in your capably nimble shoes, I'd say to heck with Hattie and my friends, yeah, heck with Hattie.

4786
03:04:42,430 --> 03:04:48,970
Now, pack myself a nice bag lunch, show these cats my favorite finger, and then I'd make like horse turds and hit the trail.

4787
03:04:49,210 --> 03:04:51,330
But I'm not you, and you're not horse turds.

4788
03:04:51,450 --> 03:04:52,350
No, sirs.

4789
03:04:52,490 --> 03:04:55,950
You are the very definition of the cat's PJs.

4790
03:04:56,090 --> 03:04:56,850
That is so cute.

4791
03:04:57,210 --> 03:04:58,610
These cats are truly bizarre.

4792
03:04:58,750 --> 03:04:59,830
Why can't we dress up like that?

4793
03:04:59,830 --> 03:05:01,170
I mean, I've got my theories.

4794
03:05:01,210 --> 03:05:01,610
Yeah.

4795
03:05:01,950 --> 03:05:03,550
Oh, aliens from another world.

4796
03:05:03,990 --> 03:05:04,110
Alien.

4797
03:05:05,870 --> 03:05:08,590
How could it be that they were once normal kitties?

4798
03:05:08,790 --> 03:05:13,810
Normal kitties who evolved into the strange, unpleasant creatures we see before us?

4799
03:05:13,990 --> 03:05:18,050
These hideously adorable abominations with their beady eyeballs.

4800
03:05:18,330 --> 03:05:24,630
Giants, bloodthirsty, tiny mouth fangs, slashy paw claws, and slashy funk traps.

4801
03:05:24,870 --> 03:05:25,910
Plus, they're awfully rude and crappy.

4802
03:05:26,190 --> 03:05:28,470
I think they all need girlfriends or something.

4803
03:05:28,710 --> 03:05:29,370
I'm a cat, see?

4804
03:05:29,510 --> 03:05:30,830
Does your cat need a girlfriend?

4805
03:05:31,030 --> 03:05:32,270
I like to run around all day.

4806
03:05:32,570 --> 03:05:33,190
I like people's feelings.

4807
03:05:33,490 --> 03:05:34,210
They don't really know.

4808
03:05:34,210 --> 03:05:35,650
They like each other, but they're not.

4809
03:05:39,090 --> 03:05:40,610
Maybe he's just chill like that.

4810
03:05:42,090 --> 03:05:43,070
Maybe he's just chill like that.

4811
03:05:43,390 --> 03:05:43,630
Yeah.

4812
03:05:43,630 --> 03:05:43,830
Yeah.

4813
03:05:44,390 --> 03:05:46,410
They're always watching children.

4814
03:05:46,710 --> 03:05:48,250
I see them lurking in the shadows.

4815
03:05:48,650 --> 03:05:49,410
Lurking hard.

4816
03:05:50,070 --> 03:05:50,130
Oh.

4817
03:05:50,710 --> 03:05:50,990
Say.

4818
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:53,770
Like a bad joke.

4819
03:05:54,290 --> 03:05:55,630
How did things get so bad?

4820
03:05:55,750 --> 03:06:00,810
At one time this theater was a nice place with flowers in every vase and smiles on everyone's mouth.

4821
03:06:00,990 --> 03:06:01,090
Yeah.

4822
03:06:01,830 --> 03:06:02,790
Can you believe it?

4823
03:06:02,950 --> 03:06:03,790
I wouldn't believe it.

4824
03:06:03,790 --> 03:06:05,770
But then he died and the cats ate his food.

4825
03:06:05,870 --> 03:06:07,610
They probably did, yeah.

4826
03:06:08,190 --> 03:06:12,610
Find a place to get ice cream to replenish the innocent you back in with your filthy deceits.

4827
03:06:12,710 --> 03:06:13,350
I want ice cream.

4828
03:06:13,710 --> 03:06:17,530
Just keep your wits about you as you descend deeper into the belly of the beast.

4829
03:06:18,090 --> 03:06:19,570
Do you like mid-chocolate chips?

4830
03:06:19,970 --> 03:06:20,410
I do!

4831
03:06:22,650 --> 03:06:24,090
No freaking way.

4832
03:06:26,010 --> 03:06:27,970
Hell yeah, we did it.

4833
03:06:28,750 --> 03:06:29,370
Hell yeah.

4834
03:06:29,390 --> 03:06:30,110
Hell yeah.

4835
03:06:30,750 --> 03:06:32,170
Oh, now he's cleaning it.

4836
03:06:33,230 --> 03:06:33,710
Yeah.

4837
03:06:34,010 --> 03:06:35,250
Wait, how did I get up there before?

4838
03:06:35,870 --> 03:06:37,250
I think you jumped on me.

4839
03:06:37,290 --> 03:06:37,950
There we go.

4840
03:06:38,130 --> 03:06:39,390
Oh, you can jump on here.

4841
03:06:41,250 --> 03:06:43,330
Actually, we have the same idea.

4842
03:06:44,450 --> 03:06:46,230
It was the silence.

4843
03:06:49,690 --> 03:06:51,830
How many chapters are in this game, guys?

4844
03:06:52,090 --> 03:06:53,110
I actually don't know.

4845
03:06:53,330 --> 03:06:54,030
Does anyone know?

4846
03:06:55,230 --> 03:06:57,610
There's at least a five and six, apparently.

4847
03:06:58,210 --> 03:06:59,590
I'm going to go gotchas.

4848
03:07:01,130 --> 03:07:01,950
Or maybe...

4849
03:07:01,950 --> 03:07:03,110
No, maybe not achievements.

4850
03:07:04,130 --> 03:07:04,570
24?

4851
03:07:04,770 --> 03:07:05,770
I think you're lying to me.

4852
03:07:06,570 --> 03:07:07,010
Yes.

4853
03:07:09,370 --> 03:07:09,810
Eight?

4854
03:07:10,150 --> 03:07:10,830
Oh, okay.

4855
03:07:11,150 --> 03:07:12,070
So this is like halfway?

4856
03:07:12,090 --> 03:07:12,710
We're like halfway?

4857
03:07:13,570 --> 03:07:14,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4858
03:07:14,290 --> 03:07:15,090
Oh, wait, what?

4859
03:07:15,090 --> 03:07:17,850
Oh, I have some fucking gems.

4860
03:07:18,030 --> 03:07:18,790
Oh, I have some fucking gems.

4861
03:07:18,790 --> 03:07:18,830
Oh, I have 60.

4862
03:07:19,210 --> 03:07:19,850
You have how many?

4863
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:21,190
60?

4864
03:07:21,550 --> 03:07:22,150
Oh, let's go.

4865
03:07:23,310 --> 03:07:24,350
What are you gonna get?

4866
03:07:25,130 --> 03:07:27,450
I kind of want to, I kind of like the squares.

4867
03:07:27,770 --> 03:07:28,270
Go square!

4868
03:07:28,410 --> 03:07:28,830
Go square!

4869
03:07:29,910 --> 03:07:30,130
Oh!

4870
03:07:31,230 --> 03:07:31,670
Oh!

4871
03:07:33,610 --> 03:07:34,950
Oh, that was cute!

4872
03:07:36,630 --> 03:07:37,030
Oh!

4873
03:07:37,850 --> 03:07:39,510
That one's so of the era.

4874
03:07:39,650 --> 03:07:40,610
Wait, that's cute!

4875
03:07:40,810 --> 03:07:42,010
Why did you keep getting cute ones?

4876
03:07:42,130 --> 03:07:43,310
You got a cat!

4877
03:07:43,770 --> 03:07:43,910
What?

4878
03:07:45,290 --> 03:07:47,710
Oh, you got another George Washington.

4879
03:07:48,270 --> 03:07:49,030
What the hell?

4880
03:07:49,130 --> 03:07:51,190
Why am I so George Washington coded?

4881
03:07:51,290 --> 03:07:51,950
I don't know.

4882
03:07:52,090 --> 03:07:53,330
Okay, I'm gonna get some too.

4883
03:07:54,570 --> 03:07:55,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4884
03:07:55,210 --> 03:07:55,790
Ah, good, good.

4885
03:07:55,850 --> 03:07:56,470
You changed it to him.

4886
03:07:56,490 --> 03:07:56,690
Cute.

4887
03:07:57,370 --> 03:07:58,910
Oh, I got a cat too.

4888
03:07:59,490 --> 03:08:00,390
Yeah, that's cute though.

4889
03:08:00,390 --> 03:08:01,430
That is so cute.

4890
03:08:03,270 --> 03:08:04,050
Wait, I like it.

4891
03:08:04,050 --> 03:08:05,090
I love his smile.

4892
03:08:05,270 --> 03:08:05,570
Yeah.

4893
03:08:07,270 --> 03:08:07,710
Snick!

4894
03:08:08,770 --> 03:08:10,110
What the heck?

4895
03:08:10,210 --> 03:08:10,990
It's actually in.

4896
03:08:11,150 --> 03:08:11,590
Snick!

4897
03:08:12,190 --> 03:08:14,070
Oh, what the f-

4898
03:08:17,090 --> 03:08:18,090
It's a nerd!

4899
03:08:19,790 --> 03:08:20,610
Oh, I like this one too.

4900
03:08:22,150 --> 03:08:22,590
It's cute.

4901
03:08:22,730 --> 03:08:23,090
Mommy!

4902
03:08:25,210 --> 03:08:25,350
Oh.

4903
03:08:26,610 --> 03:08:27,050
Hippopotamus.

4904
03:08:28,230 --> 03:08:29,070
No comment.

4905
03:08:29,230 --> 03:08:30,510
Oh, I got the scarf!

4906
03:08:32,150 --> 03:08:32,590
Spinner!

4907
03:08:34,050 --> 03:08:35,010
Wait, do you want that one?

4908
03:08:36,110 --> 03:08:37,770
Well, which one do you want of mine?

4909
03:08:39,110 --> 03:08:40,350
You want the cat?

4910
03:08:40,630 --> 03:08:42,050
No, no, you can keep a cat.

4911
03:08:42,530 --> 03:08:43,450
It's so funny.

4912
03:08:45,370 --> 03:08:47,070
I mean, I'll give you the spider.

4913
03:08:48,350 --> 03:08:49,150
Yes, please.

4914
03:08:52,310 --> 03:08:53,970
I can give you...

4915
03:08:53,970 --> 03:08:54,590
Wait.

4916
03:08:55,130 --> 03:08:55,950
Actually, you know what?

4917
03:08:55,990 --> 03:08:56,730
I feel bad.

4918
03:08:56,810 --> 03:08:57,730
Have the Washington.

4919
03:08:58,170 --> 03:08:58,870
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4920
03:08:58,890 --> 03:09:02,450
Have the Washington.

4921
03:09:03,170 --> 03:09:04,490
Oh, great.

4922
03:09:04,790 --> 03:09:05,470
Thank you.

4923
03:09:05,570 --> 03:09:07,930
How do we...

4924
03:09:07,930 --> 03:09:08,870
Ding bong!

4925
03:09:09,570 --> 03:09:10,450
Ding bong!

4926
03:09:11,510 --> 03:09:13,170
Oh, I think you need to press...

4927
03:09:13,170 --> 03:09:13,390
Yeah!

4928
03:09:14,410 --> 03:09:15,570
There you go, now you're spitter.

4929
03:09:15,710 --> 03:09:20,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

4930
03:09:20,230 --> 03:09:20,590
Oh!

4931
03:09:21,210 --> 03:09:22,790
Let me have your new face.

4932
03:09:23,390 --> 03:09:24,410
I love your new face.

4933
03:09:24,550 --> 03:09:26,470
I don't want to be square anymore.

4934
03:09:28,770 --> 03:09:29,770
What, you don't like?

4935
03:09:29,790 --> 03:09:31,930
You don't like my Washington that I gave you?

4936
03:09:32,210 --> 03:09:34,890
Uh, not quite a fan, maybe.

4937
03:09:36,230 --> 03:09:37,910
Oh, what is that?

4938
03:09:38,450 --> 03:09:39,290
An energy ball?

4939
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:40,830
Whoa, what is that?

4940
03:09:40,890 --> 03:09:41,610
Is that a vacuum?

4941
03:09:41,750 --> 03:09:42,210
What is that?

4942
03:09:42,590 --> 03:09:42,730
A lawnmower?

4943
03:09:42,990 --> 03:09:44,330
Oh, I think I got the thing you got.

4944
03:09:45,130 --> 03:09:47,990
Oh, I got a boomer- Wait, I got a toad?

4945
03:09:48,590 --> 03:09:49,350
A toad?

4946
03:09:50,230 --> 03:09:50,810
A toad?

4947
03:09:52,070 --> 03:09:52,830
Oh, Mario!

4948
03:09:53,770 --> 03:09:55,090
It just sucks you close.

4949
03:09:55,470 --> 03:09:55,550
What the fuck?

4950
03:09:55,650 --> 03:09:56,110
What is that?

4951
03:09:57,490 --> 03:09:57,870
Oh.

4952
03:09:57,870 --> 03:09:59,330
And then I can punch you.

4953
03:10:00,970 --> 03:10:03,630
Wait, can I- Wait, can I do your grenades?

4954
03:10:03,770 --> 03:10:04,250
Like throw them?

4955
03:10:05,690 --> 03:10:06,950
Oh, maybe, maybe, hold on.

4956
03:10:07,090 --> 03:10:07,810
Let me see if I can suck it.

4957
03:10:10,510 --> 03:10:11,290
Oh, oh, wait.

4958
03:10:11,350 --> 03:10:11,670
Was that a frog?

4959
03:10:12,090 --> 03:10:12,810
Wait, did that again?

4960
03:10:12,850 --> 03:10:13,150
Yeah, that was a frog.

4961
03:10:13,310 --> 03:10:13,590
Hold on.

4962
03:10:16,510 --> 03:10:17,770
Oh, my gosh.

4963
03:10:19,590 --> 03:10:19,850
Oh.

4964
03:10:20,790 --> 03:10:21,510
Oh, whoops.

4965
03:10:23,170 --> 03:10:26,390
Here, I'll throw a grenade at you and you see if you can suck it.

4966
03:10:26,390 --> 03:10:27,410
And I'll suck it.

4967
03:10:28,110 --> 03:10:28,590
Okay, here.

4968
03:10:29,050 --> 03:10:29,870
Oh, wait, that's not a...

4969
03:10:29,870 --> 03:10:30,310
That's a frog.

4970
03:10:31,890 --> 03:10:32,250
Okay.

4971
03:10:32,990 --> 03:10:34,250
I don't know how to...

4972
03:10:34,250 --> 03:10:35,430
I don't know how to switch it.

4973
03:10:36,770 --> 03:10:37,130
Okay.

4974
03:10:39,210 --> 03:10:39,570
Oh!

4975
03:10:40,150 --> 03:10:41,290
Oh, he did suck it.

4976
03:10:41,370 --> 03:10:44,110
That's funny, he kind of is just like, Oh, no, I sucked it.

4977
03:10:44,270 --> 03:10:44,510
Jeez.

4978
03:10:46,190 --> 03:10:47,550
Wait, okay, hold on.

4979
03:10:47,950 --> 03:10:49,050
And then I got this one too.

4980
03:10:50,810 --> 03:10:52,170
Wait, how did you explode?

4981
03:10:53,110 --> 03:10:56,030
I threw a grenade at the same time and it bounced back to me.

4982
03:10:56,550 --> 03:10:57,830
And then I got this one.

4983
03:10:58,950 --> 03:10:59,530
Wait, which one?

4984
03:10:59,710 --> 03:11:00,670
Wait, what did you just do?

4985
03:11:01,290 --> 03:11:02,670
I just threw you up.

4986
03:11:02,810 --> 03:11:02,970
Oh.

4987
03:11:04,110 --> 03:11:04,470
Whoa!

4988
03:11:05,570 --> 03:11:05,930
Oh!

4989
03:11:07,490 --> 03:11:08,050
Kamehameha.

4990
03:11:09,230 --> 03:11:11,390
Oh, it goes up, though.

4991
03:11:12,590 --> 03:11:13,410
A frog!

4992
03:11:13,690 --> 03:11:14,230
A frog!

4993
03:11:14,830 --> 03:11:15,690
He's so dapper!

4994
03:11:17,790 --> 03:11:18,310
He is!

4995
03:11:18,450 --> 03:11:19,490
I don't know if he's dying.

4996
03:11:23,560 --> 03:11:23,820
Oh.

4997
03:11:24,320 --> 03:11:25,380
He's invincible.

4998
03:11:25,640 --> 03:11:27,660
This one kind of sucks, though, because it goes up.

4999
03:11:28,320 --> 03:11:29,820
Yeah, it only, like, pushes you.

5000
03:11:32,260 --> 03:11:32,680
Yeah.

5001
03:11:33,500 --> 03:11:33,980
Wee!

5002
03:11:35,460 --> 03:11:36,020
Let's see.

5003
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:36,540
Nice.

5004
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,140
Nice.

5005
03:11:37,280 --> 03:11:37,400
Nice.

5006
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:38,200
Look at us.

5007
03:11:38,300 --> 03:11:39,240
We're kind of like fitted.

5008
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:40,700
I know, right?

5009
03:11:40,900 --> 03:11:41,440
Oh my gosh.

5010
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:43,320
We're so, we're so in it now.

5011
03:11:44,720 --> 03:11:46,520
We're so, we're so trendy.

5012
03:11:46,940 --> 03:11:48,100
What do the kids say nowadays?

5013
03:11:48,440 --> 03:11:48,580
Yeah.

5014
03:11:48,940 --> 03:11:49,700
Oh, no, go ahead.

5015
03:11:50,200 --> 03:11:54,400
Oh, they say, uh, swag.

5016
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:55,460
Swag.

5017
03:11:56,300 --> 03:11:57,400
Yeah, we're so swag.

5018
03:11:57,920 --> 03:11:59,000
Yeah, we're so swag.

5019
03:11:59,620 --> 03:12:01,380
We're not chopped, you guys.

5020
03:12:02,060 --> 03:12:03,340
Oh, we're not chopped.

5021
03:12:03,400 --> 03:12:04,020
It's true.

5022
03:12:04,100 --> 03:12:06,100
We're so skimpy or whatever.

5023
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:07,400
Next time, next time.

No.

Oh, I have to show you something later.

5028
03:13:12,860 --> 03:13:13,300
It's so good.

5029
03:13:14,640 --> 03:13:23,320
It's a fan parody of the FNAF game Secret of the Mimic, and it's really good.

5030
03:13:23,580 --> 03:13:24,580
Okay, I'm excited.

5031
03:13:25,360 --> 03:13:26,980
Yeah, it's really good.

5032
03:13:29,720 --> 03:13:31,400
I'm sure it is.

5033
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:32,560
Yeah.

5034
03:13:33,500 --> 03:13:57,360

Alright, you ready for some 4-1?

5037
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:09,100
I think actually I might call it here if that's okay.

5038
03:14:09,540 --> 03:14:10,740
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

5039
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:12,260
I mean, it is the halfway point anyway.

5040
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:17,640
Yeah, I think we're halfway, so then we can maybe beat it next time.

5041
03:14:18,640 --> 03:14:19,100
Yeah, yeah.

5042
03:14:19,800 --> 03:14:20,520
Wait, hold on.

5043
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:22,200
Let me send you the mimic song.

5044
03:14:23,660 --> 03:14:23,940
Okay.

5045
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:42,960
Jackie's box.

5046
03:14:46,020 --> 03:14:46,500
Okay.

5047
03:14:48,080 --> 03:14:49,020
Is this where we're at?

5048
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:55,360
You don't have to listen to it now, but I would love to hear you listen to it.

5049
03:14:55,720 --> 03:14:59,160
Okay, I will listen to it on stream and react to it.

5050
03:14:59,320 --> 03:14:59,800
Yes!

5051
03:15:00,420 --> 03:15:02,480
Yeah, it won't get struck or anything.

5052
03:15:02,520 --> 03:15:03,220
Oh, it will?

5053
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:03,800
Oh, perfect.

5054
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:04,080
Okay.

5055
03:15:04,180 --> 03:15:04,880
I don't think so.

5056
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:07,980
I played it multiple times on stream and I don't think I got struck.

5057
03:15:08,340 --> 03:15:12,000
Well, most of my streams get struck nowadays anyway, so it's fine.

5058
03:15:12,780 --> 03:15:15,000
No, man, no.

5059
03:15:15,560 --> 03:15:15,960
It's okay.

5060
03:15:17,880 --> 03:15:18,360
Yay!

5061
03:15:20,360 --> 03:15:21,320
Yeah, Otsuminto!

5062
03:15:24,460 --> 03:15:24,940
Otsuminto.

5063
03:15:25,360 --> 03:15:25,660
Otsuminto.

5064
03:15:26,460 --> 03:15:26,780

5066
03:15:27,620 --> 03:15:28,380

5067
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:31,340
Very bug.

5068
03:15:32,100 --> 03:15:33,060
Very bug.

5069
03:15:34,460 --> 03:15:37,920
Join us next time for when we stream this game while we're at Dollywood together.

5070
03:15:39,340 --> 03:15:40,900
Oh my gosh, you'll be right next to me.

5071
03:15:41,020 --> 03:15:42,860
And then I can sabotage you for real.

5072
03:15:42,940 --> 03:15:44,900
I can like knock the controller out of your head.

5073
03:15:45,240 --> 03:15:45,360
What?

5074
03:15:45,440 --> 03:15:47,100
You wouldn't do that, would you?

5075
03:15:47,620 --> 03:15:48,960
You wouldn't do that to me.

5076
03:15:49,360 --> 03:15:51,840
Grab your butt so that you would get distracted.

5077
03:15:54,080 --> 03:15:54,480
What?

5078
03:16:00,980 --> 03:16:02,960
What are you saying?

5079
03:16:04,240 --> 03:16:05,040
What I would do?

5080
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:06,380
What?

5081

I guess you did put your face in my boobies, so there's only...

5082
03:16:13,940 --> 03:16:15,200

Dude, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta do it to you too.

5086
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:31,120

5087
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:33,120
That's actually scary.

5088
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:35,640
That's actually scary.

But thank you, Minto, for collabing with me.

5103
03:18:46,240 --> 03:18:47,480
It was freaking awesome.

5105
03:19:19,300 --> 03:19:21,040
we were just like, um, we're dying.

5106
03:19:21,860 --> 03:19:25,100
We would have like beat up, but we'd be like, um, are things okay?

5107
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:26,680
No, things are not okay.

5108
03:19:27,500 --> 03:19:29,620
We'd just be like, how are you doing?

5109
03:19:31,820 --> 03:19:37,640
I'll be honest though, Mary, I don't think I would have gone to the Metal Gear pop-up if you hadn't gone also.

5110
03:19:39,260 --> 03:19:40,060
What the?

5111
03:19:40,660 --> 03:19:41,020
Yeah.

5112
03:19:41,240 --> 03:19:41,640
Of course.

5113
03:19:41,900 --> 03:19:46,100
I don't think I would have gone if I didn't talk to you about it too.

5114
03:19:46,200 --> 03:19:52,500
I think we kind of just like, we're just like, Yeah, I mean, we could stop by for, like, a day, maybe.

5115
03:19:52,800 --> 03:19:53,720
It's like a...

5116
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:55,100
Yeah, a quick little trip.

5117
03:19:55,900 --> 03:19:56,120
Yeah.

5118
03:19:57,280 --> 03:19:59,300
It was really fun, though.

5119
03:19:59,560 --> 03:20:00,080
The Delta...

5120
03:20:00,080 --> 03:20:04,620
I mean, you already played Delta at this point, but the Delta, like, preview was really nice.

5121
03:20:04,960 --> 03:20:09,740
I remember I sat next to Mr. Vinny Vine Sauce, and I was like...

5122
03:20:09,740 --> 03:20:10,180
You did?

5123
03:20:10,320 --> 03:20:11,020
Yeah, I was...

5124
03:20:11,020 --> 03:20:12,780
Yeah, I was giving him the side.

5125
03:20:12,820 --> 03:20:14,260
I was like, are you...

5126
03:20:14,260 --> 03:20:15,580
You're like someone I know...

5127
03:20:15,580 --> 03:20:16,640
You're like...

5128
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:26,220
Yeah, I sat next to him.

5129
03:20:26,680 --> 03:20:30,000
Everybody donate to Barry so she can get a new PC and play Delta.

5130
03:20:30,220 --> 03:20:32,160
No, no, I'm just late.

5131
03:20:32,260 --> 03:20:34,340
I'll bring it to a micro center soon.

5132
03:20:34,800 --> 03:20:36,260
I'm just a little lazy.

5133
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:40,140
Wait, does Minto know about the Leon Sext Kennedy story?

5134
03:20:40,280 --> 03:20:41,300
Were you, I don't know.

5135
03:20:41,380 --> 03:20:45,940
Were you in like the vicinity when I was like briefly talking to him.

5136
03:20:48,640 --> 03:20:50,340
Maddie and I were talking about Resident Evil.

5137
03:20:50,580 --> 03:20:51,540
I think I might have been there.

5138
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:52,700
Oh, wait, I think I was.

5139
03:20:52,780 --> 03:20:54,080
Because we were talking about Resident Evil, yeah.

5140
03:20:54,680 --> 03:20:59,240
Yeah, we were talking about Resident Evil, and I said Leon Sex Kennedy as a joke.

5141
03:20:59,620 --> 03:21:02,580
And Vinny was like a little, like, was like, um...

5142
03:21:02,580 --> 03:21:05,180
He was like nearby, and he, like, whipped his head to me.

5143
03:21:06,220 --> 03:21:14,320
Because I think apparently, like, his fan base calls, likes to call him, like, Leon, because he looks like him, kind of, maybe.

5144
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:18,620
So I, like, unknowingly, like, said...

5145
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:52,340
express to do stop harassing people barry i know i can't do this anymore i can't show my damn face to mr vinnie vine sauce no more oops sorry vinnie vine sauce mr vine sauce i apologize on behalf of this bug um continue doing uh i really like your your video with the snake with the Ocelot coming out of his crotch.

5146
03:21:52,740 --> 03:21:56,460
That's not the- You keep describing it that way.

5147
03:21:58,740 --> 03:22:00,280
Because that's what happened!

5148
03:22:00,460 --> 03:22:01,440
That's what happened!

5149
03:22:01,980 --> 03:22:03,820
Ocelot's head came out of his crotch!

5150
03:22:05,920 --> 03:22:07,420
I love that video so much.

5151
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:11,000
I was watching it at, um, I forgot where I was going.

5152
03:22:11,120 --> 03:22:14,780
I think it might have been, like, last year's MGSCon or something like that.

5153
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:18,440
I was watching it at the airport and I started, like, like, crying, laughing.

5154
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:20,540
At the, at the, at the gate.

5155
03:22:21,200 --> 03:22:23,140
Because I was watching it for the first time.

5156
03:22:23,380 --> 03:22:25,540
For people that don't know, he did like a glitch run.

5157
03:22:26,100 --> 03:22:27,020
And it like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5158
03:22:27,400 --> 03:22:33,040
So you could describe it that way, or you could describe it as the video where Ocelot goes out of this crowd.

5159
03:22:34,060 --> 03:22:38,720
And that's how Barry chooses to describe it instead of being normal.

5160
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:40,080
I thought people would die.

5161
03:22:40,080 --> 03:22:42,500
I thought people knew what I was talking about.

5162
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:44,240
It's a really funny video though.

5163
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:48,040
You guys should look up vine sauces, MGS3 corruption.

5164
03:22:48,640 --> 03:22:52,980
Okay, now that you say it like that, I understand why it's strange.

5165
03:22:55,540 --> 03:23:00,600
I think I might have, like, described the video like that to Vinny as well, to be honest.

5166
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:01,560
And I think you did.

5167
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:02,240
You did.

5168
03:23:02,780 --> 03:23:07,420
Yeah, I think that explains why he took a second to, like, realize what I was talking about.

5169
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:11,120
Well, you're just describing your favorite part, so, you know.

5170
03:23:11,440 --> 03:23:16,400
Yeah, yeah, I was just like, I'm not, like, a huge fan, but I like some of your videos.

5171
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:18,000
Sorry, man.

5172
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:19,440
What?

5173
03:23:19,860 --> 03:23:20,880
Can you do that again?

5174
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:23,160
Can you make him come out of the garage again?

5175
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:28,640
Can you make him, can you make his eyes pop out of his socket while he looks at his garage again?

5176
03:23:37,480 --> 03:23:41,600
Sorry, Mr. Vinny Vine saw us for such testing you.

5177
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:45,580
It was fun though.

5178
03:23:45,640 --> 03:23:46,300
It was good stuff.

5179
03:23:46,900 --> 03:23:48,100
It was a lot of fun.

5180
03:23:50,120 --> 03:23:58,340
Yeah, we took a lot of, we took a lot of pictures of the boss in the room and the with the flowers.

5181
03:23:58,840 --> 03:23:59,120
Yeah.

5182
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:05,500
Maddie, Maddie got us flowers from the exhibit.

5183
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:10,600
They're really like, like good quality too.

5184
03:24:10,740 --> 03:24:11,910
I know, it's such good quality.

5185
03:24:13,780 --> 03:24:16,140
Yeah, yeah, Maddie with the geese.

5186
03:24:16,700 --> 03:24:18,080
I love Maddie.

5187
03:24:19,020 --> 03:24:21,120
Maddie's so freaking fun.

5188
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:21,720
I love her.

5189
03:24:21,780 --> 03:24:22,800
She's so tall though.

5190
03:24:23,140 --> 03:24:25,580
I'm like, I'm like, hi Maddie.

5191
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:26,940
Hi Maddie.

5192
03:24:27,020 --> 03:24:27,020
Hi Maddie.

5193
03:24:27,060 --> 03:24:28,640
We're both down here.

5194
03:24:33,540 --> 03:24:36,500
Yeah, we should all, we had also invite Maddie.

5195
03:24:36,580 --> 03:24:37,640
She likes theme parks too.

5196
03:24:38,160 --> 03:24:39,260
So, we should.

5197
03:24:39,580 --> 03:24:41,380
We need to go to Disney Sea all together.

5198
03:24:42,460 --> 03:24:42,460
Yeah!

5199
03:24:43,220 --> 03:24:44,880
That would be a lot of fun.

5200
03:24:51,160 --> 03:24:52,700
Like more adult stuff, right?

5201
03:24:52,800 --> 03:24:54,980
Or like more thrill stuff, like more intense.

5202
03:24:55,020 --> 03:24:56,780
Yeah, there's a bit more thrilling things, yeah.

5203
03:24:57,120 --> 03:24:57,980
I want to go.

5204
03:24:58,160 --> 03:25:00,560
That would be the best day ever for me!

5205
03:25:01,440 --> 03:25:03,520
It would be so freaking epic!

5206
03:25:04,260 --> 03:25:04,660
Yay!

5207
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:11,520
It's in the spirit of the game.

5208
03:25:11,660 --> 03:25:12,700
It's Newgrounds era.

5209
03:25:13,460 --> 03:25:15,700
Oh yeah, oh, that's why I was like, oh wow, epic.

5210
03:25:17,300 --> 03:25:21,600
Also, epic is just freaking, it's just fun to say, you know, epic, awesome sauce.

5211
03:25:21,920 --> 03:25:22,700
Oh, awesome sauce.

Yeah.

5214
03:25:24,340 --> 03:25:25,260
You need to bring it back.

5215
03:25:25,620 --> 03:25:26,940
Freaking awesome sauce, man.

5216
03:25:27,300 --> 03:25:27,740
Freaking epic, man.

5219
03:25:31,360 --> 03:25:32,000

How could you do that?

5225
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:54,700
I I unironically got a TikTok the other day that was just like, you just lost the game.

5226
03:25:54,820 --> 03:25:57,220
And I was like, oh, this is my feed.

03:28:45,400 --> 03:28:50,000
And she worked really hard on it, I think, I'm assuming.

5288
03:28:50,620 --> 03:28:52,920
And And, of course, she always does.

5289
03:28:53,180 --> 03:28:55,480

5299
03:29:13,280 --> 03:29:14,560
Oh, wow.

5300
03:29:15,760 --> 03:29:18,080
Yeah, I'm going to have my sleep study soon.

5301
03:29:18,200 --> 03:29:19,900
I'm probably going to do it tonight, actually.

5302
03:29:20,120 --> 03:29:20,640
Oh.

5303
03:29:21,180 --> 03:29:25,300
Yeah, my at-home sleep study that finally my insurance fucking approved.

5304
03:29:25,560 --> 03:29:27,840
Oh, wait, I didn't realize you had an actual thing going on.

5305
03:29:28,920 --> 03:29:33,980
I feel like, I don't know, you've seen me multiple times just like falling asleep everywhere.

5306
03:29:34,300 --> 03:29:36,060
But like, I don't know.

5307
03:29:36,140 --> 03:29:37,280
I'm just like really tired.

5308
03:29:37,420 --> 03:29:42,720
I don't know if it's just like I'm just broken or like if there's like I have an actual thing going on.

5309
03:29:42,920 --> 03:29:45,940
So I just wanted to check if I did have an actual thing going on.

5310
03:29:46,020 --> 03:29:46,640
That's fair.

5311
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:50,980
I was so sleepy whenever I would meet up with you.

5312
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:56,080
Minta would be like, I'm gonna lay down on this park bench and fall asleep.

5313
03:29:56,200 --> 03:30:02,040
I know, you were, we had to go get you a burger and bring it back to the hotel room.

5314
03:30:02,100 --> 03:30:02,620
Oh yeah, yeah.

5315
03:30:04,080 --> 03:30:10,040
I remember at Knott's very far, at Knott's very far when you went to go write Ghost Rider one last time.

5316
03:30:10,240 --> 03:30:14,780
I like literally was sleeping on the picnic bench.

5317
03:30:15,580 --> 03:30:18,360
I was like laying down, I was like, I'm so sleepy.

5318
03:30:19,100 --> 03:30:20,980

Wait.

5340
03:32:02,640 --> 03:32:04,240
We were unable to join the match.

5341
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:07,900
Well, well, let me out.

5342
03:32:08,780 --> 03:32:09,380
Wait, one second.

5343
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:11,700

And Dev and Chat, that's always so exciting.

5355
03:32:37,480 --> 03:32:41,040
It's okay to ask for the only saying birthday song.

03:32:41,160 --> 03:32:42,300

Like we just, when we hang out.

5374
03:33:47,950 --> 03:33:52,750
In collab, we haven't really collabed so much, but we've always hang in game.

5375
03:33:53,170 --> 03:33:56,770
And when we hang, when we play, when we hang out.

5376
03:33:56,830 --> 03:33:58,650
Oh my gosh, she's got the glasses too!

5377
03:33:59,170 --> 03:34:02,530
