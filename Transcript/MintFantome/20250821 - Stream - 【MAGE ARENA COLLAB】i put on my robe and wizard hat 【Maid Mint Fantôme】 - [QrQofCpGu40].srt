00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:34,520
Literally, okay, the first short I saw from it is literally like, the bunny makes a giant pizza, and then she shares it with Chikawa, and then the short ends.

22
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,580
Why is it substance?

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,140
Big fireball was on the flag.

135
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,920
Oh, it's not that you're making such a beautiful flag.

00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,700
Thank you.

138
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,800
Wait, hold on.

140
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm going to get a reference.

141
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm going to get a reference.

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,800
Drawing, okay, this is gonna be, you get it, it's Liemann, right?

143
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Okay.

144
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,840
Oh, yeah?

145
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,820
What the fuck is Liemann?

146
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,060
What?

147
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,420
You don't know Liemann.

148
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,060
Liemann is my mascot.

149
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh, Liemann.

150
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,780
I'm not sure.

151
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm trying.

152
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:17,580
I'm trying.

153
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm parsing it right now.

154
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
I totally, I see the vision.

155
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,820
I see the vision.

156
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,820
I kind of forget what he looks like a little bit.

157
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,820
I think he has a green thing here, and he's just like...

158
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,720
I mean, I don't think he's got any blue on him, but let's go.

159
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,040
That's my...

160
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
Okay, that's where I come in.

161
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,440
Oh, wait.

162
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,400
Fuck, that was too big.

163
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,160
All right.

164
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:34,760
All right.

165
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,280
This has been Liemann.

166
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,520
It sounds like you guys have a good thing going.

167
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,500
Stop erasing it.

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,100
Stop erasing it.

169
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,520
Oh, no.

170
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,900
We, we, we, I immediately drew a dick and Snuffy got kind of upset about it.

171
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
That's just not very wizardry.

172
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,820
No.

173
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,220

174
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,260
The Magister Wimsy was just gone.

Hello?

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,380
Okay.

184
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,080
Is there a flag up there?

185
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,980
Oh, yeah!

186
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,440
Wait, it's just white!

187
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
What?

188
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,680
I forgot to save it!

189
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,500
You didn't save it!

190
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,760
I forgot.

191
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,470
It's just a white flag.

192
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,810
Oh, for you, you forgot to save it.

193
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,710
Yeah, I thought, because you saved it, that But I would see it.

194
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,990
Oh, no.

195
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,430
Wait, let me push.

196
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,790
I'm going to up the volume for the voice real fast.

197
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,170
Okay.

198
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,370
You keep cutting out in and out.

199
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,190
I think it's kind of janky.

200
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,330
Is it better now?

201
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:53,530
Yeah.

202
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,690
No, yours is fine from my end.

203
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,730
Oh, okay, cool.

204
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,090
Is it better now or no?

205
00:15:59,290 --> 00:15:59,610
Yeah, yeah.

206
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,390
Yours is much better.

207
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:01,930
Okay.

208
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:02,810
Yeah.

209
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,150
Okay, so you press escape.

210
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,890
You can, like, adjust the audio on the top left.

211
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,870
Or like other people.

212
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,310
Oh, we gotta get our...

213
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,370
Sands loaded in!

214
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,910
Oh, nice!

215
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,650
I see it!

216
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,130
There he is!

217
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,030
I see Sands!

218
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,770
You see Sands?

219
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,270
Yeah, I saw him from the beginning.

220
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,630
Wait, I don't hear you.

221
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,730
Oh, I actually lowered you all the way down.

222
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,290
Okay.

223
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,310
I hear you now.

224
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,030
I can hear you now.

225
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:32,690
Oh!

226
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,270
What?

227
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,790
What was that?

228
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,390
What did you do?

229
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,670
Stop!

230
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,230
Oh my god, I'm about to die!

231
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,250
Oh my god, where am I?

232
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,900
I've been respawning.

233
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,640
Oh wow, it's like a little elf village.

234
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,580
Is there... Oh, there is stamina in this game, okay.

235
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,020
Um...

236
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,960
Can I equip my... Okay, good.

237
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,840
Just in case.

238
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,200
Oh wow, there's people here.

239
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,580
Hello?

240
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,480
Oh, they're so small.

241
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,520
Oh, they're so small.

242
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,480
I have nothing to trade.

243
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:24,820
Greetings.

244
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,540
I think I hear her.

245
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,100
Doki?

246
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,200
I heard her.

247
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,200
I heard her talking.

248
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,040
I heard her talking.

249
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
Where am I?

250
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,860
Is this the afterlife?

251
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
It's different than what I...

252
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,720
No.

253
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,840
Oh, whoa, whoa.

254
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,840
Boing.

255
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,660
Boing.

256
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,900
I'm gonna get that one.

257
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,320
I'm gonna get this.

258
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:08,860
Oh, shit.

259
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,800
I missed.

260
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,260
It's fine.

261
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,180
There's no fall damage.

262
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,800
There's no fall damage.

263
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,200
It's fine.

264
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,660
Oh, my gosh.

265
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,660
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

266
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,820
Is this how you're supposed to play the game or...

267
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,920
Whose flag is this?

268
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,280
Oh, that's mine!

269
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,140
Wait, I'm so confused!

270
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,140
What's happening?

271
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,480
What?

272
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,840
A boing?

273
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,380
What's that over there?

274
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,320
It does sound like a stomach, huh?

275
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,480
The sorcerers have captured the Forest Hills.

276
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,580
What?

277
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,280
What is this game?

278
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,620
I don't know anything about this, you guys.

279
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,520
Oh, shoot.

280
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,080
A mist.

281
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,340
Boing is happening.

282
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,120
Boing.

283
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,480
Okay, hold on.

284
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,360
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

285
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,700
Oh, yeah, that's what we're talking about, baby.

286
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,900
The Forest Hills...

287
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,520
Fireball.

288
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,800
Fireball.

289
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,580
What is this thing?

290
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,220
What do you have that?

291
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,000
What is that?

292
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,580
He's way smaller than I thought.

293
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,640
Fireball.

294
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,900
What do you say?

295
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,620
I keep hearing Doki!

296
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,700
Am I crazy?

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
My spell gross.

298
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,620
Doki, can you hear me?

299
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,960
Can you hear me?

300
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Hi!

301
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,240

302
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,940
Fireball!

303
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,380
Fireball!

Oh, stop, stop!

307
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,200
Magic missile!

308
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
What just happened?

309
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,120

Fireball.

316
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,810
Fine.

317
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,190
Fireball.

318
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,070
Magic missile.

319
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,330
Fireball.

320
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,870
Why are those so dodgeable, Daisy?

321
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,410
Fireball.

322
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,190
Fireball.

323
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,390
It hates me!

324
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,070
It hates my accent!

325
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,090
Ah!

326
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:57,730
Hey.

327
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,530
Wait!

328
00:22:58,890 --> 00:22:59,550
She died!

329
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,710
Oh!

330
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,770
No, I didn't.

331
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,290
I'm fine.

332
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,610
Seems to be a cooldown, but how long?

333
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,990
It's like the longest cooldown ever.

334
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm trying, I'm speaking all calm, cool, collected.

335
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,580
It does not understand my accent.

336
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,900
It glows when it's ready.

337
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,080
Okay, I'll remember that.

338
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,460
Whoa, whoa!

339
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,540
Where did I get into a cave?

340
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,020
Why did Doki leave me?

341
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,780
The sorcerers have captured the mushroom biome.

342
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,100
That's my, that's where I captured.

343
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,580
A warlock has been slain.

344
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,700
Fireball!

345
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,280
Oh my god, she's at their base!

346
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,640
What the fuck?

347
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,940
You!

348
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,800
You!

349
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,180
A traitor is...

350
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,100
Fireball!

351
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,540
Fireball!

352
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,040
Wham!

353
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Wham!

354
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,240
Wham!

355
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,000
Where'd you go?

356
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,800
Fireball!

357
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,360
Wham!

358
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,840
Wham!

359
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,020
Did I miss?

360
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
Did I miss?

361
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
Fireball!

362
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,660
Ah!

363
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,880
Freeze!

364
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,020
Freeze!

365
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,320
Freeze!

366
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,360
Fireball!

367
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,580
Freeze!

368
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,060
Fireball!

369
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,060
Fireball!

370
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,320
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

371
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

372
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,380
Where are you?

373
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,940
Magic missile.

374
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,160
Please think of the mushroom village.

375
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:15,980
Fireball.

376
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,380
Fireball.

377
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,340
Why does it work for you?

378
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,040
Everybody, please.

379
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
It does understand British accents.

380
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,890
Wait, do we press play again?

381
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,390
Hello?

382
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,260
One spudderbubber.

383
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,690
This is why I wanted to be on Lyme's team.

384
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,850
Wait, how do we...

385
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,610
I don't think it's gonna work if we don't hear it.

386
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,410
Overall, wait, what's...

387
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:58,950
Hello?

388
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,310
Bring- Bring- Hi!

389
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,930
Bring down what sound?

390
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,510
Mons, what do you mean by that?

391
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,630
Oh, just the effects?

392
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,250
We have to remake Lobby every time?

393
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,230
Oh, I can't do that now.

394
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,870
Wait, wait.

395
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,310
Ima just said that.

396
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,710
No, no, you click.

397
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,470
No, you click.

398
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,770
What are you talking about?

399
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,750
Play it again and we're in the same lobby.

400
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,010
You guys all sound crazy.

401
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:37,930
I don't know who has food.

402
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,770
I know, I can't tell either.

403
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,610
Apparently it's fine.

404
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,250
Okay, sound effects down and overall up.

405
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,750
I'm muting Doki again.

406
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,750
She just talks too much.

407
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,410
All right, we just gotta wait for that.

408
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,390
She's mansplaining.

409
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:56,990
Oh.

410
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,330

Wait, what should we make?

413
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,860
Uh, I'm gonna say Lymo.

414
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,840
Lymo.

415
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,340
The game?

416
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,500
There's no invoice chat in the...

417
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,460
Oh, she's riding.

418
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,460
She's communicating.

419
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,800
It's like a spirit.

420
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Wait.

421
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,960
It's like a spirit bot...

422
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,800
Or a Ouija board.

423
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,300
Except I would...

424
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,780
I should be the one controlling it.

425
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,660
M?

426
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,220
Okay.

427
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,580
L.

428
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,360
This is so cute!

429
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,460
This is so cute!

430
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,540
Mario plus Luigi.

431
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,680
Wait, that's so smart.

432
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,220
Okay, hold on.

433
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,220
I'm gonna draw their hats.

434
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,940
Mario hat.

435
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,420
Mario hat.

436
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,700
And Luigi hat.

437
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,620
Why

438
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,790
is it so bad?

439
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,550
There we go.

440
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,410
Mario plus Luigi.

441
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,090
Save.

442
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,010
Mario plus Luigi.

443
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,210
Brothers.

444
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,230
Yeah, people come.

445
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,930
Me and Limeu mojito.

446
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,630
I've seen that before.

447
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,150
We're mojito.

448
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,370
How do we know when we start?

449
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,170
Start whenever...

450
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,790
Oh, Jesus!

451
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:22,430
Ah!

452
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,450
Nice!

453
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,930
Very good, very good.

454
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,630
Oh, yeah, so... What's in here?

455
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,590
What you did last time is if you take...

456
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,250
Now we have a grass crystal.

457
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:44,990
I don't know what that is.

458
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,910
I'm going to combine mine with a log and see what happens.

459
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,990
Okay.

460
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,370
I definitely did not get this because Doki killed me before I could even make anything.

461
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,410
Yeah, we were just sitting there and we just saw, like, Doki kill you immediately.

462
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,270
It was like, okay, fine.

463
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:01,810
Yeah.

464
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,650
I don't know what Doki up does, but, like, we made something.

465
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,050
That's cool.

466
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,090
How do I...

467
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,330
How do I drop an item?

468
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,050
What was it, E?

469
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:08,510
No?

470
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,690
Oh, G.

471
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,210
He's made an ingredient, and I'll make you a powerful magical soup.

472
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,950
Soup?

473
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,750
Oh, he wants an ingredient to make a powerful magical soup.

474
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,570
What about these mushrooms?

475
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,510
Would you like, is this, make frog soup.

476
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,170
I'm making frog soup.

477
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,130
Oh, nice.

478
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:29,890
Okay.

479
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,230
Ew.

480
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:30,810
Ew.

481
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,350
Your turn.

482
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,470
Oh, I got it.

483
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,650
Oh, do I drink this?

484
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,150
You go for it.

485
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,810
My tongue gains a mind of its own.

486
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,390
Oh no!

487
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,210
You touched me with your tongue!

488
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,530
I'm gonna try of the soul, the staff.

489
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,110
I do not get that, I'm stuck on the stairs!

490
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,430
Okay.

491
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:57,810
What does it do?

492
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,390
Okay, okay, okay.

493
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,410
Doesn't do anything.

494
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,770
Gen- genuinely, your tongue came out and smacked me, I don't know.

495
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,630
Oh, freaky!

496
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,590
Oh, stop?

497
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,590
Oh, of course.

498
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,490
Oh my god, dokey!

499
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,170

502
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,330
That's all done!

503
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,810
Whoa!

504
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:15,990
Whoa!

505
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,170
How'd you do that?

506
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,690
I clicked on you with it.

507
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,590
Oh, okay.

508
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,790

509
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,990

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,400

That was stupid.

525
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,510
Quick, run!

526
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,420

Fireball.

708
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,360

710
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,760

715
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,780
Magic missile.

716
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,280
Magic missile.

717
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,020

Fireball.

726
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,600
Fireball.

727
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,100
I wanna be British!

728
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,480
Freeze.

729
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,420
Oh, wait.

730
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,360

Oh, it's dark.

750
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,320

756
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,460
Built of Excalibur.

757
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,820

767
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,900
Magic missile.

768
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:04,780
Freeze.

769
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,180
Oh!

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:06,960

779
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:45,790
Oh, freeze.

780
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,410
Where are you?

781
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,170
Fireball.

782
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,970
Where are you?

783
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,510
Magic missile.

784
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,530
Magic missile.

785
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,470
Magic missile.

786
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:01,370
Magic missile.

787
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:02,050
Freeze.

788
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:02,870
Nope.

789
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,870
Fireball.

790
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:04,590
Fireball.

791
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:07,450
Magic missile.

792
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,470
Magic.

793
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,010
Freeze.

794
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,210
I can't!

795
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,000
I was on the wrong page.

796
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,860
No, it said freeze!

797
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:24,500
I

798
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,450
think I actually said rock.

799
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,110
Scalabird, tell me when you drop items when you die.

800
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,910
I'm the only one dead.

801
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,310
I tried defending this world.

802
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,350
Climbing

803
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,300
Everest.

804
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,920
What is happening?

805
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,420
He's got drop down.

806
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,420
There's no fall damage.

807
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,880
Okay, now I know what that does.

808
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,980
Okay.

809
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,200
I have this spell.

810
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,060
It doesn't like me.

811
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,280
Is this our flag?

812
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:10,780
Yeah.

813
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,420
I can save us.

814
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,680
Fireball.

815
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,320
Oh my god.

816
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,120

817
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:18,960

818
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,380
What the hell is rock?

819
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,020
The fuck?

820
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,040
What is that?

821
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,800
Fireball.

822
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,460
Toge is my beak.

823
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,060
Am I not, it doesn't, am I not saying it enunciating enough?

824
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,680
I feel like I enunciate.

825
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,040
It's my accent.

826
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,840
Ooh, graveyard.

827
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,940
Whisp.

828
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,120
What?

829
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:44,060
Whisp?

830
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,540
Where are people getting these spells from?

831
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,020
Fireball.

832
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:52,860
What?

833
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,480
Can you stop letting fucking ghosts at me?

834
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,440
What's wrong with you?

835
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:56,880
Freeze.

836
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:57,660
Cross.

837
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,600
Fireball.

838
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,200
Fireball.

839
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,370
What is going on?

840
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,230
Freeze.

841
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,430
Damn.

842
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,760
Fireball.

843
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,140
Fireball.

844
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:48,790
Magic missile.

845
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,450
Oh, freeze.

846
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:52,650
Magic missile.

847
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,650
Fireball.

848
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:56,930
Fireball.

849
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:58,150
Fireball.

850
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,750
Yeah.

851
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,980
Lime got six kills on us.

852
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,980
Holy shit.

853
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,540
It's okay.

854
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,080
I thought there was a British Biba.

855
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,200
It's really hard to know who is who.

856
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,380
Once I figure out sorcerers and the difference between wizards and sorcerers, it's easy.

857
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,240
But like, I'm looking at people and I'm like, I can't tell if that's Lime.

858
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,560
How is she an arc mage already?

859
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,740
Okay, what does it help?

860
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,360
Is that it's my accent?

861
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,260
Me neither!

862
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:51,000

00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,060
I can't believe Lai Vu is...

868
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,160

869
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,980
Oh my gosh.

870
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,100

871
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,320

935
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:26,260

01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,820
Oh, freeze.

937
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,860

Fireballs.

939
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,400

Freeze.

01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,160
I thought she was saying please, me too.

943
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,740
I didn't know what the heck she was saying.

944
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,140
This game is silly, you guys.

945
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,120

01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:14,950

Fireball.

984
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,980
Oh, Lymo can't respawn because we never claimed our base.

985
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,980
Oh, let's go claim it.

986

01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,050
I'm so confused.

998
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:22,030
How did we win?

999
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,530

01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,480
Hmm.

1005
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,560
Hmm.

1006
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,620
This game is so...

1007
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:52,180
Let's explore the great wizarding world together.

1008
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,540
I got bodied by a frog.

1009
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,020
Ah!

1010
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,200

1012
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,900
Oh, she killed- So it was the timing!

1013
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,480
There's secret stuff around the map.

1014
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,160
Wait, what's safe for Lyme, though?

1015
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:15,480
Oh, you made a new lobby?

1016

Truce?

1022
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,460
We are a team now.

1023
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,440
I think she's riding, though.

1024
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:32,880
All right.

1025
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:34,440
Hello?

1026
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,540
We are a team.

1027
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,760
A team.

1028
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,300
What I would like to be on, um...

1029
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,380
Of course she wants to be on.

1030
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,640
You know what, I'll be on Snuffy's team.

1031
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,800
I'll be on Snuffy's team.

1032
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,720
Our team flag.

1033
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,520
Oh, she's already got it going.

1034
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,120
I'm gonna, I know what we're gonna be.

1036
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,060
King of the losers.

1037
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,620
All hail.

1038
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,280
King of the losers.

1039
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,620
Wait, I think I need to make it a little bit thicker.

1040
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,120
E.

1041
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,080
R.

1042
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:22,260
S.

1043
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,560
We're the king of the losers.

1044
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:39,500
Oh, I thought they wouldn't want a flag that has, like, losers on it.

1045
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,180
Oh my god, yes.

1046
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,900
Okay, here we go, wait, mint you go.

1047
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:42,860
What?

1048
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,360
Check it out.

1049
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:43,980
Yeah?

1050
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,500
This small!

1051
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,820
Someone told me to make a soup.

1052
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,680
This is an ingredient, and I'll make you a powerful magical soup.

1053
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,220
Someone told me to make a rock soup.

1054
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,720
Yeah, I've never made a soup before.

1055
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,110
Okay, let's try it.

1056
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,120
I'm gonna eat it.

1057
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,460
See how this heals you.

1058
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,120
Hello?

1059
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,620
It says my voice bellows from the mountaintops.

1060
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,300
Wait, why did Doki stab Limu?

1061
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,360
You might be very loud.

1062
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,820
Like, you might be so loud that your voice is echoing maybe 10 times right now.

1063
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,320
Hello?

1064
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,660
Uh-oh.

1065
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,220
I'm gonna eat rock soup.

1066
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:30,620
Let's, or no, log soup.

1067
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,880
She eats rocks.

1068
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,080
She eats rocks.

1069
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:33,460
Wait.

1070
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,120
Okay, here we go.

1071
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,060
Log soup.

1072
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:40,760
Your skin hardens like tree bark.

1073
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,000
Oh my god, I got extra help.

1074
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,300
You got extra help.

1075
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,400
Oh, I see it.

1076
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,340
Am I still loud?

1077
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,200
Yes.

1078
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,240
Yes, you are.

1079
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,420
They might be able to hear you.

1080
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,480
You should say names to them.

1081
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,400
You should call them names.

1082
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,980
I'm gonna say slurs!

1083
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,420
YouTube, that's a joke.

1084
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,460
I'm going inside the crystal dimension.

1085
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,020
Oh, there's a cavern.

1086
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1087
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,340
I'm going, I'm investigating this cavernous area.

1088
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,020
Wait, I thought Doki wanted us to be friends this time.

1089
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,860
Should we, should we, should we ask them to come with us?

1090
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,760
Wait, I'm gonna go back.

1091
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,240
Okay.

1092
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,260
B.

1093
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:27,640
Wow!

1094
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,720
I'm gonna go ask them if they want to come.

1095
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,780
If they don't agree, I'm gonna shrink them so they're not threatening.

1096
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:37,540
Yeah.

1097
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,720
Oh, I tried to shrink that bird.

1098
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:40,460
Hello?

1099
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,060
Hello?

1100
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,360
We're friends?

1101
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,480
Truce?

1102
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:45,940
Truce?

1103
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:46,260
Truce?

1104
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,260
Truce for real first?

1105
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,120
Come in peace?

1106
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:49,580
Peace?

1107
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,000
Yes?

1108
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,060
Why did you...

1109
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,660
Why did you murder Lymu then?

1110
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,440
Oh.

1111
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:54,340
Because...

1112
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,300
Because...

1113
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,060
Look, oh no no no no, this is a peace place.

1114
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,260
Okay.

1115
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:00,880
It's okay.

1116
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,040
It's only for it's only it's for our own safety.

1117
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,970
Yeah, you're okay smaller

1118
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:35,710
do it to me i'm small too oh my gosh i'm fast

1119
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:42,950
Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:49,550
The way she just gets her ankles.

1121
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,890
Wait, I want that.

1122
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,350
No, you took it.

1123
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:00,850
What?

1124
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,490
It's the ray of shrinking.

1125
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:10,630
No, don't, don't, don't, no, no, no, don't.

1126
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:17,530
I...

1127
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:19,030
Magic missile.

1128
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:22,630
I'm gonna shake you!

1129
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,390
I'm gonna shake you!

1130
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:24,690
No!

1131
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:28,750
Fireball.

1132
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,160
Fireball.

1133
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,600
What's this?

1134
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,960
She took my pogo.

1135
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,160
She took my pogo stick.

1136
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,840
I thought we were supposed to

1137
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,920
explore.

1138
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:09,770
Yeah, we are.

1139
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:11,990
I can have my stick back.

1140
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,770
Am I back to normal height?

1141
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:14,750
They were back to normal.

1142
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,270
Oh, wait.

1143
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:16,630
Okay.

1144
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:18,010
Here.

1145
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:19,250
Here's your walk.

1146
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:19,770
You sick.

1147
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:20,630
Oh, thank ya.

1148
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:23,530
Oh, where's Snuffy then?

1149
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,350
Why do you have that?

1150
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:27,770
What's my peaceblade?

1151
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:28,470
Okay.

1152
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:29,270
Where's...

1153
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:29,830
Where's Lyme?

1154
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:30,530
I'm in peace.

1155
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,210
She's in the middle.

1156
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:36,510
Wait, where's Snuffy on your map?

1157
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:37,510
In the middle?

1158
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:39,210
Okay.

1159
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:39,510
Oh, wait.

1160
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,290
Then they're both together.

1161
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,250
Let's go to the middle then.

1162
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:42,130
Okay, we'll go to the middle.

1163
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:42,810
Wait.

1164
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,850
How do I get out of here?

1165
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,090
How the hell do I get?

1166
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,690
Oh, there it is.

1167
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,370
What the fuck do you mean?

1168
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:48,990
I don't know!

1169
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:49,990
I don't know I was lost!

1170
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,050
Yeah, stab in peace.

1171
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,710
Stab in peace, okay.

1172
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:54,310
No, you don't stab at all.

1173
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:55,390
You don't stab at all.

1174
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:56,610
You don't stab at all.

1175
01:13:59,430 --> 01:13:59,870
Hello?

1176
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:02,430
Hello?

1177
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:03,150
Hello?

1178
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,730
Wait, guys, guys!

1179
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:07,670
We lost together.

1180
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:08,950
What?

1181
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,950
Come in peace.

1182
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:10,930
Hi.

1183
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:11,370
Oh, hey.

1184
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,170
I wanted to explore the crystals.

1185
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:16,150
Yeah, let's go explore!

1186
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,070
In here, in here.

1187
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:22,990
There's one right here, too.

1188
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,650
You sound so insincere right now.

1189
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,350
I swear to fuck if you stab me.

1190
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:28,370
Fireball.

1191
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,630
I'm right next to you.

1192
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,830
Oh, we can like pop fireworks.

1193
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:35,230
Fireball.

1194
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:38,710
Wait, what's going on?

1195
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,010
Should I leave the portal here?

1196
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,210
Like, like, worm?

1197
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:41,810
Oh, yeah.

1198
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:45,770
And then we'll have multiple portals just in case.

1199
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:46,610
Yeah, yeah.

1200
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:47,610
Okay, I'm calling back.

1201
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,770
Does anybody have their torch?

1202
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,830
I have mine.

1203
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:53,110
And then we jump down.

1204
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:54,150
Don't fall.

1205
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,850
There is apparently fall damage.

1206
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:57,630
Oh, there is.

1207
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,910
Yeah, I learned that going in here.

1208
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,510
I'm getting Dark Souls flashbacks.

1209
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:02,910
I hate this.

1210
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,310
Here we go, here we go.

1211
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,330
Okay, and then I'm gonna make a hole.

1212
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:10,850
Wait, what's that?

1213
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:12,970
This is one of them.

1214
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:17,410
All there...

1215
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,070
Is that...

1216
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,190
Was just the...

1217
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:19,950
The hack hole?

1218
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:21,390
Is this the hole?

1219
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:22,530
Yeah, I guess so.

1220
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,690
Is this everything?

1221
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:24,690
Oh, no.

1222
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:25,550
I got the hole.

1223
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:28,050
Wait, where are you guys?

1224
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:29,890
I'm in the hole.

1225
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:31,750
I'm here.

1226
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,150
Yes, that's all there is.

1227
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:33,610
Dang.

1228
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,030
What's over here?

1229
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,370
It looked like big old carrots.

1230
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,650
Wait, all adults have protection.

1231
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:39,170
Yay!

1232
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:40,650
Crystal cabins.

1233
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,690
Oh, this is nothing.

1234
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,850
Sorry, finders keepers.

1235
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:45,770
I feel like there's anything here.

1236
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,590
They're skeepers.

1237
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:51,050
What about, we got a funny scalabry.

1238
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,410
Why don't we get the rest of it?

1239
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:53,250
Scalabry.

1240
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,410
I got killed by glitchy skeletons, but I got it from the crypt.

1241
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:58,910
Wait, wait, we can all, like, try...

1242
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:59,450
What?

1243
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,030
Why did she go?

1244
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:02,430
Where did she go?

1245
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,310
Where did she go?

1246
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:06,330
But they're all legal expired, which kind of sucks.

1247
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,030
Oh, no!

1248
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,330
Wait!

1249
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:10,590
I can't go through!

1250
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,270
So yeah, we can just climb up.

1251
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:14,150
Again.

1252
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:15,470
Oh, ouch.

1253
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:16,590
Why?

1254
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:18,010
We can recall with B.

1255
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:19,030
I think that's what she did.

1256
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:21,030
Yeah, yeah, you can go back home with B.

1257
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,250
Wait, am I the only one going...

1258
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:25,550
Oh, okay.

1259
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:26,050
Oh.

1260
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:28,850
Bye.

1261
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,130
I was just gonna climb out.

1262
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:32,950
It's not that hard.

1263
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,010
I did it last time.

1264
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,130
It's literally right here.

1265
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,270
Everybody's so lazy.

1266
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:40,510
Hello?

1267
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:44,570
Hello?

1268
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,910
I want to go, wait, cue.

1269
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,270
To the red all the way on the ride.

1270
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:55,130
Tornado?

1271
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,080
I know?

1272
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:02,980
Yeah.

1273
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,400
Oh, there you go.

1274
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,560
Oh, my gosh.

1275
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,920
I went over there and I was like watching some sort of vortex.

1276
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:08,780
It was really weird.

1277
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:10,600
Let's check it out.

1278
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:10,880
Oh, wait.

1279
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,600
There's a mountain.

1280
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,100
Yeah, there's a mountain here.

1281
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:14,180
Whoa.

1282
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,560
Oh, my gosh.

1283
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,440
It's really windy.

1284
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,660
Yes, we're having a deal here.

1285
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,020
A worm.

1286
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,620
But our holes expire.

1287
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,340
They do.

1288
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:31,740
They do.

1289
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:31,960
They do.

1290
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:33,720
Oh!

1291
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,220
Stuffy!

1292
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,480
Oh no!

1293
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,040
I'm okay.

1294
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,140
Oh, you're still here.

1295
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,340
Wait, wait.

1296
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:42,920
Hold.

1297
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,600
Oh no, a frog ate Lymo.

1298
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:12,780
Oh no.

1299
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,620
That's so nice.

1300
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,620
Oh my gosh.

1301
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,160
Oh my gosh.

1302
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,540
But there's another...

1303
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,520
There's another passageway over here.

1304
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:24,910
I got back up.

1305
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,880
Mid-phantom frog dokeybird.

1306
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:29,560
Wait, how?

1307
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:30,040
What?

1308
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,980
How did I just frog dokeybird?

1309
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,640
How did that happen?

1310
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,580
I killed somebody.

1311
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,720
Oh, this is just a separate way up, I think.

1312
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,330
Are you up the top?

1313
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:56,490
There was nothing up there except the flag.

1314
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,650
You have to go all the way up here for a flag?

1315
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:01,370
That's crazy.

1316
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,930
Yeah.

1317
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,870
I killed a person.

1318
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:09,210
I killed Doki somehow as a frog.

1319
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:10,870
Oh, in here.

1320
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:11,230
Wait.

1321
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,050
Okay.

1322
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,790
Do you guys want to explore a creepy tomb together?

1323
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,290
Yes, yes.

1324
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,630
I've always wanted to explore a creepy tomb.

1325
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,050
Oh, boy, do I?

1326
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,850
That's my afterlife's wish.

1327
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,390
Yeah, there's some creepy skeletons in here, so we gotta be careful.

1328
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,450
Wait, like harm, they move and...

1329
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:34,130
Oh, enter mausoleum.

1330
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,190
How do I get in?

1331
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:36,150
Oh, here we go.

1332
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:37,730
Stable geometry.

1333
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,870
It might even be spooky scary skeletons.

1334
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,710
Spooky scary skeletons.

1335
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,410
And shivers down my spine.

1336
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:48,710
What was that sound?

1337
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:49,870
Are they doing magic?

1338
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:51,550
They are here.

1339
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,890
Oh my gosh.

1340
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:54,890
Oh my gosh.

1341
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:58,230
I can't see anything though.

1342
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,070
I'll keep my thing out.

1343
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:01,250
My torch.

1344
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:02,930
Sounds good.

1345
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,890
Oh yeah, there's an NPC wandering around who will attack us, I think.

1346
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:07,330
Can you go slightly ahead?

1347
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,770
Oh, he's still exceeding me.

1348
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,890
Can you shine a light for me?

1349
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:11,410
Yeah.

1350
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,330
There he is.

1351
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:12,770
Oh!

1352
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:14,530
Magic missile!

1353
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:16,750
There's only... Oh!

1354
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:18,750
Oh!

1355
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,450
Oh, oh, I'm nothing without you, Lai-Mu.

1356
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,750
I'm nothing without you, Lai-Mu.

1357
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,130
I can't do this on my own!

1358
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:31,550
Hello?

1359
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,370
I'll wait for her.

1360
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:38,490
Hello?

1361
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,430
How am I almost dead?

1362
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:42,510
Hello?

1363
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:43,910
Oh, hey!

1364
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,410
What happened to the other haters?

1365
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,850
Uh, Lai-Mu is in there exploring.

1366
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:50,350
Do you want to go help her?

1367
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:50,670
Where is she?

1368
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:52,010
Yeah, what's this?

1369
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:53,550
Have you tried in the soup before?

1370
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,850
No, what is that?

1371
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:55,890
Oh.

1372
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,880
What happened?

1373
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:01,900
Hello.

1374
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,040
Hi.

1375
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,800
Okay, do you still have your sword?

1376
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,300
No.

1377
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,220
My peace sword got eaten.

1378
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,420
No, not eaten.

1379
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,160
There's like NPCs down there that I think would be better if we had swords.

1380
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:15,880
Oh, really?

1381
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:16,900
Oh.

1382
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,440
Yeah.

1383
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,280
Okay, I drank a magic potion.

1384
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,360
So I should be really strong now.

1385
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,140
Oh.

1386
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,400
What does the magic potion do?

1387
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,300
Go in there and fight him.

1388
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,380
I'll back you up with my torch.

1389
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:28,260
Okay, let's go.

1390
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,040
I believe in Doki.

1391
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,240
I believe in Doki.

1392
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:34,520
Alright.

1393
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,220
Alright, go on down.

1394
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:38,860
Ow.

1395
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,320
What do you mean, ow?

1396
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:48,720
Spooky, scary, skeletons, and shivers on your small world's side.

1397
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,480
Alright, keep going.

1398
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,110
Ouch.

1399
01:21:57,850 --> 01:21:58,770
That was a choice.

1400
01:21:58,890 --> 01:21:59,610
That was a choice.

1401
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:00,230
That was a choice.

1402
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:00,990
Ouch!

1403
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:01,310
Ouch!

1404
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:02,430
I'm gonna die.

1405
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,910
Goodbye, cruel world!

1406
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,090
Oh, I lived.

1407
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,510
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1408
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,050
I died.

1409
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:15,350
What happened?

1410
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,530
What happened?

1411
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:31,590
Um, oh, they're in the middle.

1412
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,690
Wait, I can get to the red world from here.

1413
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,990
Is that the red world over there?

1414
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:38,370
Yes.

1415
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,430
Red world, red world, red world, red world.

1416
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:46,910
My spells are growing stronger.

1417
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:51,070
Wait, so there's actual other enemy...

1418
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:51,230
Wait.

1419
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,670
Oh, I think this is our home.

1420
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:57,650
No.

1421
01:22:57,850 --> 01:22:59,410
I think Snuffy's at our home.

1422
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,910
Oh, this is their home.

1423
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,370
Oh, I understand now.

1424
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:04,510
I'm learning more.

1425
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:07,770
Crystal.

1426
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,550
I think Pokemon's on its own.

1427
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:14,390
I'm kind of mad.

1428
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:18,570
What was that?

1429
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,240
This

1430
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,050
is what I sounded like earlier.

1431
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:51,530
Baby bird.

1432
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,740
I'm just gonna keep eating soup.

1433
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:09,700
I don't know what it does, but I think I'm becoming stronger.

1434
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,820
I think I'm becoming stronger.

1435
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,660
Donkey bird, are you that crow talking to me?

1436
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:20,760
Gosh.

1437
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,120
I'm feeling full of soup.

1438
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,100
What are you bringing, little guy?

1439
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,300
More crystals?

1440
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,000
else.

1441
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,200
I hunger, I crave a delicious meal.

1442
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:42,170
I like how there's just like cut up trees and stuff around.

1443
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,750
How do you find the Excaliburs and things?

1444
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,250
Yeah I'm full of soup.

1445
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:50,910
I'm full of soup.

1446
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:55,390
Can you die in the fire?

1447
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:56,530

01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,050
A spell?

1452
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:12,150
Oh, you got it?

1453
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:13,490
Yeah, I got it.

1454
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:14,010
Whoa!

1455
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:18,410
Divine light.

1456
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:21,590
Whoa.

1457
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:22,910
It's cool.

1458
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:26,310
And everyone goes, oh.

1459
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:28,210
Looks good.

1460
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:31,470
Oh my god, all I have to do is do that.

1461
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:32,730
Whoops, sorry sound guy.

1462
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:34,550
Is this the...

1463
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,350
Can I make soup?

1464
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:36,830
No.

1465
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:39,850
Now you can actually balance the game for me.

1466
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:40,370
For real.

1467
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:43,770
Anything else in here worth taking?

1468
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:51,250
I found, I also got stuck in this room going round and round in a loop for like a minute and shot off Debbie.

1469
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:52,470
Oh wait.

1470
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:54,570
How do I break this?

1471
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:56,130
I don't know.

1472
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:56,890
Oh, I found it.

1473
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:59,870
I found another ace of Excalibur, you guys.

1474
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:01,170
Why are you on fire?

1475
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,290
Wait, why am I burning?

1476
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,190
Oh my goodness.

1477
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:04,370
Wait, why am I burning?

1478
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,230
Wait, why am I burning?

1479
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,870
Wait, let me test something.

1480
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:08,610
I got it.

1481
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:12,930
I don't think so.

1482
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:14,150
How did that get burned?

1483
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:20,230
Is there another one?

1484
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:24,550
Hey, don't burn me!

1485
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:26,210
Magic missile.

1486
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:29,390
Magic missile.

1487
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:31,530
Oh wait, I'm on fireball.

1488
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:33,130
Ouch!

1489
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:34,150
Oh.

1490
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:36,390
Magic missile.

1491
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,850
Why am I a fire against?

1492
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:43,090
Stop burning me!

1493
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:47,710
Come here.

1494
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,400
Come here.

1495
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:53,980
Come here.

1496
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:54,460
No, it's an item.

1497
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:54,720
Okay.

1498
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,580
So how do we craft the blade?

1499
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,800
I would assume you go back to the altar and put the two pieces on.

1500
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,160
I think I'm burning tea.

1501
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,140
I'm going all on fire.

1502
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:10,230
Freeze!

1503
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:14,310
Snuffy!

1504
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,970
Wait, so there's more in here?

1505
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:17,110
You can make that thing!

1506
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:22,030
If we killed the skellies, that means there's more stuff, no?

1507
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:24,090
Loot?

1508
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:26,510
Nothing, just skellies?

1509
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:27,990
That lame.

1510
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,320
I'm lost.

1511
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:45,890
Stop it!

1512
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:46,810
Stop it!

1513
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,230
Stop it!

1514
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,290
Stop it!

1515
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:49,950
Stop it!

1516
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:50,410
Stop it!

1517
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,670
Stop it!

1518
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:02,070
Hey, Snuffy, which base are you going to?

1519
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,290
too, because I'll come with you.

1520
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:07,410
Yeah, I would think...

1521
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,390
Yeah, put the two pieces in the altar, probably.

1522
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:12,470
Is there, like, a wild crafting bench you can use?

1523
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:14,070
No, I don't think so.

1524
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:15,130
I haven't seen one.

1525
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:19,730
I think I'm on a different base.

1526
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:24,370
I will walk and escort you to my house, to my wizard.

1527
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,630
Okay, let's go.

1528
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:26,650
Let's go.

1529
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:27,110
Yeah.

1530
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:28,970
Maybe we'll bump into the children.

1531
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,530
Sorry if it's, like, kind of messy.

1532
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,530
We haven't cleaned up, you know.

1533
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:35,190
Stop!

1534
01:29:35,630 --> 01:29:36,210
Stop it!

1535
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:37,630
Stop it!

1536
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,350
Stop it!

1537
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,010
Stop it!

1538
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:40,870
Design light!

1539
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:42,690
Whoa!

1540
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,270
Not punished!

1541
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:48,890
I'm not a pyromaniac, I swear.

1542
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:50,690
Rock!

1543
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,810
Okay, let me put this on here.

1544
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:54,610
Rock!

1545
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:56,750
Now put the other part on there.

1546
01:29:58,270 --> 01:29:58,950
Whoa!

1547
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:00,530
Whoa!

1548
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:05,890
Can I murder someone in the name of science?

1549
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:06,770
Me!

1550
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:08,210
I nominate men.

1551
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,450
That was good.

1552
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:25,710
I can't even let this go.

1553
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:26,870
I'm like stuck.

1554
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,590
He was just pointing it.

1555
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:29,470
Can you hold...

1556
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:31,250
Wait.

1557
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:32,090
No.

1558
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:32,910
Okay, okay, okay.

1559
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,570
Okay, I've recovered.

1560
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:33,990
I've recovered.

1561
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,310
Here you go.

1562
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:35,910
Here you go.

1563
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,230
Next time she sets you on fire, Mint.

1564
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:38,830
Thank you!

1565
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:40,490
You're welcome.

1566
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:44,090
I like how it strikes lightning down when you die.

1567
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:44,690
I know.

1568
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:46,010
It's really epic.

1569
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:46,830
Don't tell her you have it.

1570
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:47,450
It'll be funny.

1571
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,950
Like hide it and then when she tries.

1572
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:54,530
What are you snacking on?

1573
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:57,470
I drank soup!

1574
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:22,010
I wonder why we're doing that.

1575
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:23,350
Is Doki alive?

1576
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:24,570
I don't see her on the mat.

1577
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:24,990
Yeah, yeah.

1578
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:25,910
She will respawn.

1579
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:26,450
She's coming.

1580
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,150
I could see her.

1581
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:27,870
Oh, okay.

1582
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,010
I respawned from it.

1583
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:30,350
I came to hell.

1584
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:31,130
Wait.

1585
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:32,190
Hello.

1586
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:34,210
Wait, did you drink that potion?

1587
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:35,630
I could hear you from all the...

1588
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:37,750
Oh.

1589
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:38,930
Oh.

1590
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:38,990
Oh.

1591
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:39,750
Oh.

1592
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,030
Oh.

1593
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:40,250
Oh.

1594
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:40,950
Oh.

1595
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:50,890
What?

1596
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:56,810
He just crashed in the air.

1597
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,740
Divine light.

1598
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:09,950
Divine light made the kids go yeah!

1599
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:13,110
Yeah, oh no, it's because you got our flag.

1600
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:14,350
Yeah, I got the flag.

1601
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:14,990
Yeah, yeah.

1602
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:17,310
I'll take it back now.

1603
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:18,030
I'll take it back.

1604
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:20,790
Oh, our flag that has nothing on it.

1605
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:21,430
Complaining.

1606
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:24,110
I think this is broken.

1607
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:25,450
Why can't I just paint this story?

1608
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:25,830
Why?

1609
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:27,650
Huh?

1610
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:37,650
She still got me on fire before I killed her.

1611
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:39,810
I fell into it for once.

1612
01:32:40,670 --> 01:32:41,430
Oh no.

1613
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,130
What have I done?

1614
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:45,690
Divine light.

1615
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:50,770
What's that?

1616
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:54,390
I got two rounds together and made me cry.

1617
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,570
These shit!

1618
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:57,970
We were, what are you doing?

1619
01:32:57,970 --> 01:32:59,630
We're your own fucking megaphone.

1620
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:01,310
Oh,

1621
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:07,410
more rocks!

1622
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,370
More rocks!

1623
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:09,570
I got more rocks.

1624
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:15,350
What's up here?

1625
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:25,160
Is Excalibur the only thing you can get in this game?

1626
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:26,940
Like...

1627
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:27,240
No,

1628
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:38,960
when you guys are 3B1ing me, Snuffy managed to find a spell that costs like wisps that tracked me through the entire fucking map.

1629
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1630
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,640
And we have a spell that made rocks, like, explode and then killed herself with it.

1631
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:43,860
Yeah.

1632
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,500
Yeah, that sounds all right.

1633
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,520
That sounds, yeah.

1634
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,580
Wait, why can't I draw it?

1635
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,400
There we go.

1636
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,780
Let's go to the top of this.

1637
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,440
Wait, Limu, can I...

1638
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,580
Can I Sephiroth you?

1639
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,080
Yeah.

1640
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:02,480
Just take my divine light afterwards.

1641
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:04,820
Oh, no, actually, I don't want to... here.

1642
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,940
Oh, yeah, I made it.

1643
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:08,260
Wap, wap, wap, wap.

1644
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,440
Oh.

1645
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:16,830
Yeah.

1646
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:21,230
Divine light.

1647
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:22,510
Wait, how do I use this?

1648
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:24,950
Divine light.

1649
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,210
Oh, divine light.

1650
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:28,530
Divine light.

1651
01:34:29,490 --> 01:34:30,590
Divine light.

1652
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:35,370
I feel so blessed.

1653
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:43,090
I have this drumming thing, but I don't know what this does.

1654
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:46,070
That's what, that's what, uh, Snuffy's been using.

1655
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:48,170
Wait a second.

1656
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:48,870
What does it do?

1657
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:52,370
Try, use it, use it.

1658
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:53,670
Oh, wait.

1659
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:54,670
Hello?

1660
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:57,270
Hello?

1661
01:34:58,210 --> 01:34:59,170
I use it.

1662
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:00,690
Oh, I don't think it works.

1663
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:02,950
I don't think it works because you're small.

1664
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:04,550
I think it's for the rock soup.

1665
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:07,970
I think if you shrink me and I do rock soup, I just...

1666
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,690
Ew, look at it, Twitch.

1667
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:12,090
Look at it twitching.

1668
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:13,430
Do you see it twitching?

1669
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:16,030
No, I think it's only on your screen.

1670
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:16,410
Oh.

1671
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:21,830
Let me drink you.

1672
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:24,110
Okay.

1673
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:27,430
Wow.

1674
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:35,070
Do you see it wiggling?

1675
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,010
Alright, let's go.

1676
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:39,410
Let's go to the...

1677
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:41,390
Let's go to the goblin village.

1678
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:44,130
Oh, okay, that's fine too.

1679
01:35:45,570 --> 01:35:48,230
Here's your divine light, Lymo.

1680
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,830
And your Excalibur.

1681
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,750
No, no, I'm not...

1682
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:58,490
I want Excalibur.

1683
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:01,050
No, no, no, no.

1684
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:03,450
Look at that Excalibur.

1685
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,730
I'll trade you.

1686
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:10,190
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1687
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:17,130
There you go.

1688
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:21,470
Oh, thank you.

1689
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:22,290
Be small.

1690
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:23,830
Thank you.

1691
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:23,950
You're welcome.

1692
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:24,630
Wait, what?

1693
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:27,170
Oh, sorry.

1694
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:28,250
Oh, sorry.

1695
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:29,670
I didn't mean to make you tiny.

1696
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:31,270
Wait, I don't know how to...

1697
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:32,170
Am I sure...

1698
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:32,710
Am I tall?

1699
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,270
Yes.

1700
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:34,930
You are now.

1701
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:35,890
Oh, okay.

1702
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:37,270
Do you want to be small?

1703
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:39,070
Oh, thank you.

1704
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:41,150
You're welcome.

1705
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:51,210
They're in the forest, but...

1706
01:36:53,110 --> 01:36:55,390
Oh my gosh, even the map is big.

1707
01:36:55,670 --> 01:36:56,830
What is this?

1708
01:36:59,450 --> 01:36:59,790
What?

1709
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:05,870
Hey, why are you guys so small?

1710
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:08,050
We've been smallening each other.

1711
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:08,830
Okay, now I'm big.

1712
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,230
Okay, let's go to the goblin village and grab more spells.

1713
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:12,930
Wow.

1714
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:17,050
Does it work?

1715
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:18,910
Follow the sound of the children.

1716
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:20,650
Follow the sound!

1717
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:26,030
Wow.

1718
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:30,970
Have you guys seen the goblins?

1719
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,110
The goblins.

1720
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:34,970
I think it's the bottom one.

1721
01:37:35,710 --> 01:37:37,610
That's where the goblins village.

1722
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:39,470
Let's go find them.

1723
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:40,850
It's the...

1724
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:41,110
It's the...

1725
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,210
It's at the bottom.

1726
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:58,690
So it should be the right side The right side this way this way yeah, yeah Oh, it's gonna be this way It should be I don't know why we're trusting Wait, there's a sign.

1727
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,650
Oh, this is a tree.

1728
01:37:59,810 --> 01:38:12,120
I thought it was a sign That's the swamp I don't think we have it this time.

1732
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:49,480

I can't get out!

1742
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,920
Excalibur eaten by a frog is pretty iconic.

1743
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:11,600
Oh...

1744
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,820
Can you imagine he eats Excalibur and just like...

1745
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,100
combusts from inside?

1746
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,140
Hey buddy, grab my hand!

1747
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,420

1749
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,100
Please don't stuck!

1750
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:25,180
It happens if you like regain stamina for a bit.

1751
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:26,300
Okay.

1752
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,120
I'm not regaining stamina.

1753
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,160
Shops are like immune to damage, bro.

1754
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,440
Maybe, yeah.

1755
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:37,600
Can you get out here?

1756
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:38,800
There's a slope here.

1757
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:40,240
Okay, let me try that.

1758
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,400
Are you sinking lower?

1759
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:44,760
No, I'm not.

1760
01:39:45,620 --> 01:39:46,800
Wait, there's a frog right there!

1761
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:47,940
I'm out, I'm out!

1762
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:49,380
Yay!

1763
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,260
Oh, wait.

1764
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:51,980
Guys.

1765
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:53,780
Oh, no.

1766
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,320
Wait a minute.

1767
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:58,580
It'll be fine.

1768
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,320
Log lift.

1769
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:01,720
Oh, I got it.

1770
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,260
Oh, I got it.

1771
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:02,600
Oh, I did it.

1772
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:02,820
All right.

1773
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:04,540
Oh, the frog disappeared.

1774
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:06,660
Oh.

1775
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,920
You gotta find a frog so we can...

1776
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,680
Divine line.

1777
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,520
Yay!

1778
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:12,260
Yay!

1779
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,240
I hear one.

1780
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,280
Are we killing a frog?

1781
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:16,900
Oh, shoot.

1782
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,260
Yeah, yeah, we're killing a frog.

1783
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:18,700
Oh, shoot.

1784
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:19,400
Oh.

1785
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,160
Oh, she didn't make it.

1786
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:21,900
Oh, I'm forgiving, isn't it?

1787
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:22,140
Oh.

1788
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:23,300
Yeah.

1789
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,100
Wait, I killed one.

1790
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,640
And it dropped a bird.

1791
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:27,040
Oh.

1792
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:28,860
We didn't even crack you.

1793
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,200
I can't even get around.

1794
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:31,860
Okay, here we go.

1795
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,420
There's a slope behind you.

1796
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:34,420
You can probably get back up there.

1797
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:35,120
This one?

1798
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:37,160
I got the toad and made a raster.

1799
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:37,580
Yeah.

1800
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:38,780
Oh, oh.

1801
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,160
Fireball.

1802
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:42,360
Fireball.

1803
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,240
That's definitely dead.

1804
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:46,940
I think so.

1805
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,740
Oh, there he is!

1806
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,020
Fireball.

1807
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:52,800
Fireball.

1808
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:54,840
I got it.

1809
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:56,420
Do we just keep going?

1810
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,700
I got a frog and spawns a frog where they- Oh my god.

1811
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,320

01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,180
Fireball.

01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,720

1847
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:15,140
Yeah, she did.

1848
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,240
Oh, she gave you the...

1849
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,740
Oh, my gosh.

1850
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,320
Hold on, I'm gonna take a voice.

1851
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,440
I'm too much screaming in this game.

1852
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,860
Too much craziness.

1853
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,160
Where am I?

1854
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:33,480
Oh.

1855
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,120
I didn't know that there were guys in there.

1856
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,420
Oh, we're back here.

1857
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:41,960
Maybe I can get a frog.

1858
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:53,140

1859
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:08,730
oh what the hell was that

1860
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:22,370
what the hell was that this also has to do And the curse of the heavens.

1861
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,610
Oh, that was Excalibur, wasn't it?

1862
01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:33,270
I think maybe that's Lymu killing the people.

1863
01:44:36,090 --> 01:44:37,870
Go, Lymu, go!

1864
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:55,280
Did you get it?

1865
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:56,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

For now, yeah.

Did you do it?

1868
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:00,460
Maybe one of the other towers has more?

1869
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:02,200
See, maybe.

1870
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,440
Oh my god, I didn't get up here.

1871
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:05,460
There's towers?

1872
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:07,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1873
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,740
Yeah, spiral staircases.

1874
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:09,960
Okay, I'm going.

1875
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,080
Hey, there's another one.

1876
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:14,590
What's in the now water?

1877
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:15,370
I'm going up.

1878
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:16,290
I don't know.

1879
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:16,910
Come touch it.

1880
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:17,910
I'm running out of space.

1881
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:20,050
Okay, I'll loot it.

1882
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,140
Got a torn page.

1883
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:25,640
Blake.

1884
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:35,040
Where are you guys?

1885
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,580
Uh, dark blast.

1886
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:45,500
Okay.

1887
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:49,140
Did I get anybody?

1888
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:52,580
It was, um, let's get out of here.

1889
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:55,620
It sucks here, and I think Doki Bird got a new spell.

1890
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,320
Teleported into the lava and died?

1891
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:58,420
I don't know.

1892
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,740
Oh, fuck, God.

1893
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,800
I'm so unlucky.

1894
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,200
Let's get out.

1895
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:05,320
Yeah, let's go.

1896
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:06,400
Fireball.

1897
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:08,200
Fireball.

1898
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:09,580
Doki run.

1899
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,980
I got a new spell.

1900
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:14,960
Oh, what'd you get?

1901
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:15,440
What'd you get?

1902
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:18,040
I'll use it on Doki.

1903
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:19,960
Okay.

1904
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:26,870
You can hear her just freaking out in there.

1905
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:33,790
Doki, follow the sound of- What the- So if I say her name it-

1906
01:46:40,870 --> 01:46:43,870
Follow the sound of our voice!

1907
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:46,470
Come here, Doki!

1908
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,250
We're outside!

1909
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:52,150
Special beam cannon or something.

1910
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:54,470
Kamehameha or some- We're outside!

1911
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:55,610
Turn around!

1912
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:56,550
Outside the lava!

1913
01:46:58,670 --> 01:46:59,730
We're outside!

1914
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:00,910
Oh!

1915
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:06,590
This thing is dangerous!

1916
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:12,290
What does blink do?

1917
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:14,770
It makes you zip.

1918
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:15,630
Oh.

1919
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,530
Be careful using it because you might go straight into the lava.

1920
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:22,650
Oh, I didn't take your weed of the pie, but...

1921
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:27,490
They'll eventually leave that castle, right?

1922
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:28,370
Huh?

1923
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:31,490
They'll eventually leave the castle, right?

1924
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,210
Are you guys coming outside?

1925
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:37,610
What is that sound?

1926
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,130
Oh, like new stuff too?

1927
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:44,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1928
01:47:45,470 --> 01:47:45,870
Whoa.

1929
01:47:48,230 --> 01:47:49,950
You should come outside.

1930
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:51,730
Wait, wait, wait.

1931
01:47:51,890 --> 01:47:52,350
Give me a sec.

1932
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:54,170
I'm double checking this area.

1933
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,350
Okay.

1934
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:55,990
What new stuff?

1935
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,150
What new spells?

1936
01:47:58,770 --> 01:47:59,970
What is that noise?

1937
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:01,390
I don't...

1938
01:48:01,390 --> 01:48:01,550
What?

1939
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:16,760
noise yeah yeah what was that dark blast

1940
01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:35,910
oh my god that's cool oh it took I took credit for the kill why oh she got wait She got something.

1941
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:37,830
What'd she get?

1942
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:38,310
What'd she get?

1943
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:39,470
Whisp.

1944
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:42,130
Oh, that's the bullshit.

1945
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:44,590
That, like, tracked me across the fucking map and killed me.

1946
01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:45,950
That's my little guy.

1947
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:47,310
Yeah.

1948
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:50,110
Don't forget your dark blast.

1949
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,230
I don't think Doki's going to be very happy with you.

1950
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,310
Oh, no.

1951
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:54,530
I got the dark blast.

1952
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:56,630
Oh, what's this one then?

1953
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:57,250
Oh, is it blink?

1954
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:57,690
Yeah.

1955
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:00,810
I guess I'll take it, so in case I need to run.

1956
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:05,890
She's over there.

1957
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:06,970
I hear her.

1958
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,130
No.

1959
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:10,830
What the fuck am I supposed to be?

1960
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:13,770
You took my sweat and sweat down me.

1961
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,550
Hello?

1962
01:49:17,310 --> 01:49:18,290
Dark Blast.

1963
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,250
Oh my god, it's a...

1964
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:22,470
Oh my god, it's a wisp spell.

1965
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:24,970
I kept...

1966
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:26,910
You took my sweat.

1967
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:28,370
Whisp.

1968
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:30,530
Whisp.

1969
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:32,410
Whisp?

1970
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,470
Oh, it's supposed to be right.

1971
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:34,890
There we go.

1972
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:37,150
That's right.

1973
01:49:37,490 --> 01:49:38,610
Fireball.

1974
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:40,610
Thunderbolt.

1975
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:43,330
Not me!

1976
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:44,950
Thunderbolt.

1977
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:55,100
Where'd they go?

1978
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:58,640
I just hear the tiny thunderbolt.

1979
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:06,510
Dark blast.

1980
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:10,810
What does it do?

1981
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:15,350
I'm dying to myself?

1982
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:16,830
Wait, where is he?

1983
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,790
How did I die?

1984
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:23,730
No, she's gonna take all my stuff.

1985
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:24,190
Oh.

1986
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:26,270
How'd you die?

1987
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:29,050
I got eaten by a frog.

1988
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:31,670
I was trying to craft a crystal frog.

1989
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:33,030
I don't know what they're gonna do.

1990
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,790
How do you do that?

1991
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:39,780
Fireball.

1992
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,400
Oh, I heard him.

1993
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,420
I heard him die, I think.

1994
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,800
You think we actually got him?

1995
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:50,780
Oh gosh, I'm out.

1996
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,420
Uh, uh, oh no.

1997
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:53,900
I'll get out.

1998
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,420
Don't worry about me.

1999
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,560
I'll figure it away.

2000
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:02,280
Good job, Lymo.

2001
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:22,200
.

2002
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:26,880
Fireball.

2003
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:30,380
Fireball.

2004
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:33,520
I think that was him.

2005
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,320
Fireball.

2006
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:39,570
Oh, oh, oh.

2007
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:40,590
He sounds close.

2008
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:42,530
Oh, there he is.

2009
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:44,410
Fireball.

2010
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:48,110
How do you get him?

2011
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:52,250
Fireball.

2012
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:56,530
Like he sounds dying.

2013
01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:00,250
Who goes there?

2014
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:04,350
How many people can play in these lobbies?

2015
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:09,890
Gotta arc it.

2016
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:18,480
Thought that was something.

2017
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,380
Why am I leveling up still?

2018
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:28,840
Oh, I thought I wasn't gonna make that, guys.

2019
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,360
Get out!

2020
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:33,600
Get out!

2021
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:34,040
Get out!

2022
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:34,280
Get out!

2023
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:34,600
Get out!

2024
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:34,600
Get out!

2025
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:35,440
Get out!

2026
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:37,080
Get out!

2027
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:37,160
No!

2028
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:39,280
No!

2029
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:51,350
Luckily I didn't have anything.

2030
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:52,690
Ha!

2031
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:02,030
I wish the game had a little bit more.

2032
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:05,830
Like more things to explore and uncover.

2033
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:10,290
I'm stuck in the mountains.

2034
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:13,850
Like, uh, kind of like, like, you have the mausoleum.

2035
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:17,030
You have the fire castle.

2036
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:21,010
Is there anything else?

2037
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:29,430
Hmm.

2038
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:31,210
Is this our home?

2039
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:33,050
Home sweet home?

2040
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:36,450
Oh, this guy's just been leaving rocks for us.

2041
01:53:42,430 --> 01:53:45,190
Guys, if I make the rock soup, what should I say?

2042
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:46,730
For everybody to know.

2043
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:49,890
You can ask questions at the magic mirror.

2044
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:54,990
Mirror mirror.

2045
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,780
How are you?

2046
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:04,960
Yeah.

2047
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:11,510
I didn't say anything.

2048
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:15,110
Hello?

2049
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:19,430
It's like a magic eight ball.

2050
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:21,910
No.

2051
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:24,250
No, not snub!

2052
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:27,910
Yeah, no, no snub!

2053
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:33,780
Oh, okay.

2054
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:39,460

01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:44,710

Toad, wait, that is...

2071
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:38,520
The toad stick was something.

2072
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:39,600
What does it do, though?

2073
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:44,740
There's toad, toad, toad crystal, toad rock, and toad rock again.

Frog.

01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:01,820
Try frog rock.

2081
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:03,000
That sounds promising.

2082
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:06,460
I think that was in the tutorial or something, but I don't remember what it did.

2083
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:09,600
Yeah, the log, frog log or something.

2084
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,120

01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:13,980
Frog stick.

2087
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,380
But I can't read what it does.

2088
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:15,920
Can you?

2089
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,400
Oh, the elevator.

2098
01:57:59,660 --> 01:57:59,900
Oh!

2099
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:02,560
They're killing each other.

2100
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:08,520
I'm crafting, I'm just, I'm studying the science while they're too busy crafting.

2101
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:09,640
Okay, it's time.

2102
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:13,620
It's done him the sorcery.

2103
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:17,400
What is it?

2104
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,520
What does it do to you?

2105
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:19,920
Nothing.

2106
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:20,540
Wait, hold on.

2107
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:21,300
Let me try grabbing.

2108
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:22,420
No?

2109
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:26,900
What does it do?

2110
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,040
Wait, hold it out?

2111
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:31,760
Just hold it?

2112
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,440
I try, but it...

2113
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,140
Oh, here we go.

2114
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,060
But it has like a timer.

2115
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,680
I don't know what it does.

2116
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,880
It steals held items.

2117
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,280
I don't think so.

2118
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:47,940
Oh!

2119
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:48,960
You took it.

2120
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:49,380
I did.

2121
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:50,580
But I dropped.

2122
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:51,840
But I didn't take it.

2123
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:53,180
Wait, let me try.

2124
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,000
Oh, it makes you drop it.

2125
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:57,380
Oh, you disarm people.

2126
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:58,520
Oh, my God.

2127
01:58:59,360 --> 01:58:59,600
Wait.

2128
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,740
We're upgrading our wizard game.

2129
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:01,520
You're so much.

2130
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:04,280
Try your book.

2131
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:06,860
Oh, my book.

2132
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,020
You can steal my book?

2133
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:08,880
That would be crazy.

2134
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,040
Oh my god!

2135
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:12,560
Wait, that's a game changer.

2136
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:14,800
Wait, wait, can you take it?

2137
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:15,720
Hold on, take it again.

2138
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,160
Can you just take it out of my inventory and pick it up?

2139
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:22,080
Uh, no, I can't pick it up.

2140
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:23,140
Dang.

2141
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,140
Be a little OP.

2142
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:25,980
That is scary.

2143
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:30,060
Even without my tomes, my tomes.

2144
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:30,520
I know!

2145
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:33,260
How'd you make the frog gun?

2146
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:36,280
The crystal and frog.

2147
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,180
Oh, crystal frog.

2148
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:39,880
Crystal.

2149
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:41,500
Any frog?

2150
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:42,160
Ah, nice.

2151
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:42,760
Thank you.

2152
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,540
Crystal and frog.

2153
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,800
Oh, I just took your gut or your materials.

2154
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:53,880
Ink.

2155
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:54,520
Thank you.

2156
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:03,780
I like the way it sounds.

2157
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:05,140
It sounds like a squishy toy.

2158
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:07,840
Yeah.

2159
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:08,380
Oh, gosh.

2160
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:09,300
Okay, I'm back to normal.

2161
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:10,480
Frog plus frog.

2162
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,000
Let's see if we can find them.

2163
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:15,600
Wait, this is the frog balloon.

2164
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:16,920
Wait, yeah, yeah.

2165
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:20,560
Are you gonna float?

2166
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:24,180
Where are you?

2167
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,500
Oh, there she goes!

2168
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:31,380
I can't.

2169
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:32,980
Oh, right, I'm poison.

2170
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:34,180
I have to move this way.

2171
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:35,180
Goodbye, Mint.

2172
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:35,800
Goodbye!

2173
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,620
I'm the Mary Poppins of Wizards!

2174
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:44,980
Does it work?

2175
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:47,380
Do I just have terrible aim?

2176
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:49,620
I think you have bad aim.

2177
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:50,660
Aw, man.

2178
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:55,700
Hey, Doki.

2179
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:57,980
What do you mean we'll never know?

2180
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,480
I'm wearing like a little spinner hat while I'm holding my fucking balloon right now.

2181
02:01:02,660 --> 02:01:03,680
Like, I feel like so...

2182
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:04,240
What do you mean we'll never know?

2183
02:01:05,120 --> 02:01:06,120
You'll never know.

2184
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:06,880
Wait, give me a second.

2185
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,060
I'm trying to get the sword back.

2186
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,280
I'll be right back.

2187
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,460
What do you mean the sword?

2188
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:12,720
Try to get the sword back.

2189
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:15,240
I don't think she knows where I died.

2190
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:18,640
I have that in.

2191
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:21,640
Did she get the sword?

2192
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:25,680
Where are you?

2193
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:27,460
Wait, I'm here.

2194
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:28,640
What is that?

2195
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,320
Let me use it on you.

2196
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:32,220
Oh wait.

2197
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:32,920
What is that?

2198
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,060
What did you do?

2199
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:39,960
That does.

2200
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,920
I know what that does.

2201
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:43,840
I know it.

2202
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:45,780
I'm finding it.

2203
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:53,780
That was not the sword the first time.

2204
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:55,560
No!

2205
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:58,280
That's when you get back here.

2206
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,640
Get back here.

2207
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:01,540
Are you bullying me again?

2208
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,320
Yeah!

2209
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:04,840
She bullied me!

2210
02:02:07,140 --> 02:02:08,440
Where'd you drop it?

2211
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,520
Where'd you drop it?

2212
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:11,940
I don't know where it is.

2213
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:14,220
That's a tree.

2214
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:15,120
You did it.

2215
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:16,050
Wait, what'd you...

2216
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:20,620
Oh, I like your blue frog.

2217
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,940
Thank you.

2218
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:22,960
That looks cool.

2219
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:25,040
Wait, why am I purple?

2220
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,660
Oh, I'm backwards.

2221
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:27,400
Why am I backwards?

2222
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:28,400
I hate that.

2223
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:32,400
Why am I purple?

2224
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:36,480
Somebody needs to play a little time out, Missy.

2225
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,180
I made them purple.

2226
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:46,700
Oh!

2227
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:49,800
Wait, I like this area.

2228
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:04,130
Guys, I think I missed.

2229
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:21,850
What haven't we claimed?

2230
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:25,690
What haven't we claimed?

2231
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:28,410
What haven't we claimed?

2232
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:44,100
Can I try?

2233
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:47,860
Fireball.

2234
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,640
Fireball.

2235
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:03,560
Fireball.

2236
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:11,150
Fireball.

2237
02:04:11,650 --> 02:04:12,490
Nice.

2238
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:14,530
What's happening?

2239
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:15,470
Free!

2240
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:18,310
Fireball.

2241
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:21,290
Fireball.

2242
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:23,410
Oh, she died?

2243
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:24,550
Nice.

2244
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:26,790
I love freezing.

2245
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:29,070
My frog balloon!

2246
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:32,870
I don't have divine light anymore.

2247
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:34,510
I'm gonna go make a frog balloon.

2248
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:37,490
Did somebody miss their tone?

2249
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:39,090
Nikki!

2250
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:40,530
I wanna make one too!

2251
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:41,190
Oh.

2252
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:42,950
Why is that here?

2253
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:44,810
It was Frog Frog, right?

2254
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:49,810
They keep bringing us stuff, so...

2255
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:51,250
Oh, I didn't mean to drop that.

2256
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:55,170
Frog Frog.

2257
02:04:57,850 --> 02:05:00,870
Uh, E-G-E-G-E-G.

2258
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:03,990
We have one frog.

2259
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:06,870
The little children will bring more.

2260
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:11,010
I don't think...

2261
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:11,630
I don't see one.

2262
02:05:11,650 --> 02:05:19,030

2264
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:43,750
Give me the frog.

2265
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:46,260
Okay, that should work.

2266
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:50,050
Imagine if they could still hear me right now.

2267
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:51,570
That'd be embarrassing.

2268
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:56,290
Ribbit.

2269
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:09,290
Rock plus crystal.

2270
02:06:09,970 --> 02:06:11,050
Let's try it.

2271
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:15,620
Oh, the child.

2272
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:17,880
Oh my god, he listened!

2273
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:19,100
Wow!

2274
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,400
Oh my god!

2275
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:30,100
Hello?

2276
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:35,310
I'm bringing you a frog.

2277
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:37,210
You found the frog?

2278
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:37,730
Yeah.

2279
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:39,570
The child brought me one actually.

2280
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:41,750
We have all so many supplies over here.

2281
02:06:41,930 --> 02:06:42,310
It's crazy.

2282
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:43,070
Thank you though.

2283
02:06:43,290 --> 02:06:43,930
Thank you.

2284
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:45,310
No problem.

2285
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:47,150
I like how you guys gathered a ton of supplies.

2286
02:06:47,450 --> 02:06:50,950
Meanwhile, I just like hunkered down Doki like seven times in a row or something.

2287
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:52,030
That's good too.

2288
02:06:52,670 --> 02:07:19,210
to figure it out each quadrant on the map if you press q each biome represents a simple material like rock crystal or frog i guess in wood so if you capture it goblins will passively bring these see them coming behind doki they will just passively bring you all these items yeah so while you capture it they'll just keep taking you frogs and rocks so that's how you get into what is this guy doing crystals at me i'm going to leave

2289
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:23,450
That's cool.

2290
02:07:23,570 --> 02:07:26,110
This guy keeps fucking throwing stuff at me.

2291
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:27,850
Yeah?

2292
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:29,350
He's a bad boy.

2293
02:07:29,810 --> 02:07:30,370
No, he's not.

2294
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:31,370
He's my child.

2295
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:33,330
He's a bad boy.

2296
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:34,170
He's a bad child.

2297
02:07:35,210 --> 02:07:36,010
Oh, wow.

2298
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:37,510
Oh, my God.

2299
02:07:38,190 --> 02:07:39,950
No more children in the workplace.

2300
02:07:40,230 --> 02:07:42,070
No, no, my child, please.

2301
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:43,970
Let me have him please, please.

2302
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:45,810
I'm going to go put him into the ocean.

2303
02:07:46,110 --> 02:07:46,870
I think he'll follow.

2304
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:48,410
Yeah, kill the child.

2305
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:51,250
Don't kill my child.

2306
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,470
Yeah.

2307
02:07:52,670 --> 02:07:54,270
Can I fly over the ocean?

2308
02:07:57,190 --> 02:07:58,190
Oh, little baby.

2309
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,930
Go.

2310
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:02,010
He has, like, an ASMR sound when he walks.

2311
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:04,990
Like, rock moving?

2312
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:06,050
You like that?

2313
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:06,750
Yeah.

2314
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:07,690
Does your ears feel good?

2315
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:08,530
Yeah, it does.

2316
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:09,770
Here, I'll take him.

2317
02:08:09,770 --> 02:08:11,590
I'll take him so he can follow me here.

2318
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:12,630
Alright.

2319
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:14,250
Follow me, child.

2320
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:17,530
Oh, yeah.

2321
02:08:18,690 --> 02:08:19,950
Ice age, ASMR.

2322
02:08:20,210 --> 02:08:20,490
Yeah, yeah.

2323
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:21,730
Follow me, little guy.

2324
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:22,650
What if I go up?

2325
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:35,620
Yeah, you've been killing them, but they're useful.

2326
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:40,940
No, yeah, but when you kill them, they still drop the stuff regardless.

2327
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:43,380
Look at my child, he's coming.

2328
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:44,360
See you, watch this.

2329
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:47,180
Wait, what?

2330
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:53,220
All right, let's reset the map.

2331
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:53,940
Oh, my God.

2332
02:08:55,460 --> 02:08:56,560
Wait, wait, what happened?

2333
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:05,090
My frog balloon!

2334
02:09:07,910 --> 02:09:08,670
Oopsie.

2335
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:12,050
What happened?

2336
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:16,890
Oh, new lobby says Doki.

2337
02:09:17,690 --> 02:09:17,690
Okay.

2338
02:09:19,650 --> 02:09:21,570
Oh, I almost leaked it.

2339
02:09:22,590 --> 02:09:23,990
I almost leaked the lobby.

2340
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:26,430
I don't think you guys would have enough time to join them.

2341
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:28,270
Probably?

2342
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:29,050
Maybe.

2343
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,170
He's an orphan.

2344
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:42,160
Hello?

2345
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:50,140
Like a trigger for these games is like, I hate when little game, little indie games pop off so good.

2346
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:51,220
They have so much potential.

2347
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,660
But then it's just like they're tiny indie games.

2348
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:54,660
They're tiny little projects.

2349
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,440
So you never get like a further update.

2350
02:09:57,380 --> 02:09:59,900
Staring at you, web fishing.

2351
02:10:00,220 --> 02:10:00,820
See, see.

2352
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,440
Thank you so much for this over there.

2353
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:06,120
I'm sorry that I have two clams on your birthday, but happy birthday!

2354
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:07,440
There's a magic mirror on the wall.

2355
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:08,620

2386
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:35,910
Whoa!

2387
02:12:38,710 --> 02:12:39,830
Insane distance!

2388
02:12:41,150 --> 02:12:41,710
Unhitable.

2389
02:12:42,150 --> 02:12:43,230
Do we have... Oh.

2390
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:45,710
Um...

2391
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:49,130
I don't think we have the village again.

2392
02:12:50,590 --> 02:12:51,710
No, maybe not.

2393
02:12:51,990 --> 02:12:53,330
Yeah, it doesn't look like it.

2394
02:12:53,950 --> 02:13:02,690
Yeah, we have the mountain, the woods, the fire castle, the bouncy shrooms, festivals, creepy cemetery, and what's the top one, top metal?

2395
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:03,850
I think that's a swamp.

2396
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:06,070
Oh.

2397
02:13:07,650 --> 02:13:08,130
Yeah.

2398
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:10,850
Maybe Dookie should be rolling again?

2399
02:13:11,830 --> 02:13:12,870
Oh, no, sleepy.

2400
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:15,210

Contagious yawn.

2402
02:13:17,650 --> 02:13:19,290
I am always yawning.

2403
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:25,170
How long does the soup last for?

2404
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:26,530
I have no idea.

2405
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:30,550
Is there anything special in this area?

2406
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:31,670
Like, it feels very...

2407
02:13:31,690 --> 02:13:50,890
lackluster it's kind of whatever yeah some areas are like yeah this is just a dead forest i guess we can go to their base and then be like okay didn't get the village again yeah oh

Okay.

2415
02:14:22,810 --> 02:14:24,470

Okay.

2417
02:14:27,290 --> 02:14:28,670
Oh, they're talking to the mirror.

2418
02:14:28,970 --> 02:14:30,850
A Doki bird.

2419
02:14:37,210 --> 02:14:38,390

02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:40,650
Yeah.

2423
02:14:41,410 --> 02:14:42,230
Wait, what happened?

2424
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:44,150
We didn't spawn, so...

2425
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:46,150
Oh, did the village spawn?

2426
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:47,570
No, I didn't.

2427
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:48,630
How do you know?

2428
02:14:48,730 --> 02:14:50,030
There's like so many things.

2429
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:51,950
We checked on the map.

2430
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:54,910
The swamp, Mount Everest, the fire castle.

2431
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:56,610
Oh, that's the swamp.

2432
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:58,750
Yeah, the top is the swamp.

2433
02:14:59,270 --> 02:14:59,450
Okay.

2434
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:04,090
Do you want that slide?

2435
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:24,720

2436
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:25,400

02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:30,960
Fireball.

2440
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:37,830
The sound's just as stupid when you say it.

2441
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:40,990
Fireball.

2442
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:42,110
Fireball.

2443
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:44,090

Fireball.

2449
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:53,510
Fireball.

2450
02:15:54,470 --> 02:15:55,070
Ah.

Wizard's hat.

Which is a new global emote they just uploaded and it's like snake running along with the box on top of them.

2498
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:05,750
What?

2499
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:07,430
Yeah.

2500
02:20:08,410 --> 02:20:10,230
They uploaded that as a global?

2501
02:20:11,530 --> 02:20:13,590
Yeah, I guess for the release.

2502
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:15,350
and sorcerers.

2503
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:15,630
Hello.

2504
02:20:16,510 --> 02:20:18,310
No, wait, I just gave him my book.

2505
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:20,970
Wait, I think I messed up.

2506
02:20:21,390 --> 02:20:24,810
He traded your book for one crystal.

2507
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:27,410
He traded me a log for a log.

2508
02:20:27,790 --> 02:20:29,390
He got me a rock?

2509
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:35,870
He gave me a lot?

2510
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:39,290
He gave me a magic spell.

2511
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:40,970
I got a spell too.

2512
02:20:41,090 --> 02:20:41,370
Oh god.

2513
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:41,490
Hoor.

2514
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:45,070
That's okay, man.

2515
02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:46,610
You don't need magic.

2516
02:20:48,990 --> 02:20:49,550
Divine light.

2517
02:20:50,930 --> 02:20:52,250
Wait, I got two spells.

2518
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:53,690
Wait, I got one called rock!

2519
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:55,650
No, just let me die!

2520
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:57,470
That was my spell.

2521
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:59,110
Just let me die!

2522
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:02,650
Oh my god!

2523
02:21:03,090 --> 02:21:05,630
I'm gonna cast it over here because it sounds scary.

2524
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:07,810
Oh, that spell.

2525
02:21:09,690 --> 02:21:11,190
What a spell.

2526
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:14,010
Oh, yeah.

2527
02:21:14,230 --> 02:21:15,890
It looks like we killed Doki with last round.

2528
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:16,870
She likes that spell.

2529
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:17,730
You should show it to her.

2530
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:18,470
Which one?

2531
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:20,710
It's the rock.

2532
02:21:21,690 --> 02:21:21,870
Oh.

2533
02:21:22,530 --> 02:21:22,910
Rock.

2534
02:21:24,070 --> 02:21:26,350
It has a very long cooldown, though.

2535
02:21:26,550 --> 02:21:27,010
Say it again.

2536
02:21:27,470 --> 02:21:27,550
Oh.

2537
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:28,710
Rock.

2538
02:21:30,130 --> 02:21:33,690
Oh, if you stand on top of it, you can go high up.

2539
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,810
Oh, that's crazy.

2540
02:21:36,270 --> 02:21:37,270
Does the rock despawn?

2541
02:21:37,730 --> 02:21:38,230
I got this one.

2542
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:39,510
Dark blast.

2543
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:44,210
Well, you put her out.

2544
02:21:44,230 --> 02:21:44,930
to her misery.

2545
02:21:45,310 --> 02:21:47,470
I've been put out of my misery.

2546
02:21:49,290 --> 02:21:51,990
Guys, I can't believe I sold my book.

2547
02:21:52,410 --> 02:21:53,610
I got my book back.

2548
02:22:02,990 --> 02:22:03,390
Yippee!

2549
02:22:07,830 --> 02:22:08,570
What was that?

2550
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:17,550
Don't lose it again.

2551
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:18,590
No promises.

2552
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:23,610
Wait, where are they?

2553
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:26,510
I want to trade things that are not my book.

2554
02:22:27,730 --> 02:22:28,170
Wait.

2555
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:32,330
Where am I?

2556
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:34,920
I need to go

2557
02:22:38,830 --> 02:22:40,150
This way?

2558
02:22:41,210 --> 02:22:41,350
Yeah.

2559
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:46,850
Yeah, I'm eating chicken nuggets.

2560
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:51,210
I got some.

2561
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:55,310
I got my book back.

2562
02:22:55,510 --> 02:22:56,830
I got my book back.

2563
02:22:57,610 --> 02:22:58,670
I will get back.

2564
02:23:00,650 --> 02:23:01,110
Yeah.

2565
02:23:01,430 --> 02:23:01,610
Thank you.

2566
02:23:01,610 --> 02:23:04,590
I tried to blow her up with the laser beam.

2567
02:23:04,750 --> 02:23:05,390
Yeah.

2568
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:07,110
And I was like so far away.

2569
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:07,930
You can have, wait.

2570
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:09,650
I can have this.

2571
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:11,690
Thank you.

2572
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,250
Whisp.

2573
02:23:20,710 --> 02:23:21,350
Whisp.

2574
02:23:22,790 --> 02:23:23,350
Whisp.

2575
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:25,070
Whisp.

2576
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:26,650
Whisp.

2577
02:23:28,590 --> 02:23:28,970
Whisp.

2578
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:29,470
Whisp.

2579
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:29,490
Whisp.

2580
02:23:29,490 --> 02:23:29,790
Whisp.

2581
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:30,350
Whisp.

2582
02:23:30,650 --> 02:23:31,370
Whisp.

2583
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:34,010
Whisp.

2584
02:23:34,170 --> 02:23:34,970
Whisp.

2585
02:23:35,650 --> 02:23:36,450
Whisp.

2586
02:23:36,790 --> 02:23:37,590
Whisp.

2587
02:23:38,530 --> 02:23:39,330
Whisp.

2588
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:42,690
Whisp.

2589
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:43,130
Whisp.

2590
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:45,090
Whisp.

2591
02:23:45,650 --> 02:23:46,290
Whisp.

2592
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:46,650
Whisp.

2593
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:46,810
Whisp.

2594
02:23:46,810 --> 02:23:47,030
Whisp.

2595
02:23:47,390 --> 02:23:47,550
Whisp.

2596
02:23:47,550 --> 02:23:48,650
So it said whisp.

2597
02:23:49,410 --> 02:23:49,910
Whisp.

2598
02:23:51,050 --> 02:23:51,110
Whisp.

2599
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:51,310
Ah!

2600
02:23:51,770 --> 02:23:53,790
That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, okay.

2601
02:23:54,570 --> 02:23:55,790
Ouch, my legs.

2602
02:23:56,310 --> 02:23:57,230
Oh, that's because I'm light.

2603
02:23:58,490 --> 02:23:58,890
Whisp.

2604
02:23:58,890 --> 02:23:59,570
Whisp.

2605
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:01,930
Wisp.

2606
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:03,030
Wisp.

2607
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:06,210
Wisp.

2608
02:24:07,530 --> 02:24:08,170
Wisp.

2609
02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:09,870
Wisp.

2610
02:24:09,870 --> 02:24:16,410
We can't finish the stream until you get the Wisp off.

2611
02:24:17,490 --> 02:24:17,990
Wisp.

2612
02:24:19,650 --> 02:24:20,290
Wisp.

2613
02:24:20,530 --> 02:24:21,170
Wisp.

2614
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:21,490
Wisp.

2615
02:24:21,490 --> 02:24:27,070
I don't think it does damage, so I don't think it'll kill us if it does.

2616
02:24:27,670 --> 02:24:28,250
Wisp.

2617
02:24:30,650 --> 02:24:32,750
I'm trying to like, oh my god, we killed them all.

2618
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:38,210
Oh my god, you murdered them!

2619
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:40,010
Oh my god!

2620
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:43,650
Whisp.

2621
02:24:45,270 --> 02:24:45,990
Whisp.

2622
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:47,750
Whisp.

2623
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:48,890
Whisp.

2624
02:24:48,890 --> 02:24:49,210
Whisp.

2625
02:24:49,330 --> 02:24:50,050
Whisp.

2626
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:50,470
Whisp.

2627
02:24:50,470 --> 02:24:51,150
Whisp.

2628
02:24:54,290 --> 02:24:55,910
What is it?

2629
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:57,750
Order 63 or something?

2630
02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:07,670
Whisp, Whisp, Whisp, Whisp, Whisp, Whisp.

2631
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:08,150
Whisp.

2632
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:10,130
Mine and blast.

2633
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:13,270
Order 66.

2634
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:17,570
I can say mine and blast, but Mince can't say whisp 100 times about a person.

2635
02:25:17,770 --> 02:25:18,290
Whisp.

2636
02:25:19,710 --> 02:25:20,230
Whisp.

2637
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:20,410
Whisp.

2638
02:25:20,410 --> 02:25:21,150
Is it broken?

2639
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:22,170
Whisp.

2640
02:25:22,370 --> 02:25:23,750
Okay, do it to us, Clem.

2641
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:24,790
See if we can do it.

2642
02:25:25,310 --> 02:25:25,830
Try it.

2643
02:25:25,830 --> 02:25:26,170
Let's try.

2644
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:27,850
Whisp.

2645
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:29,570
Whisp.

2646
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:30,930
Whisp.

2647
02:25:31,070 --> 02:25:32,950
I think I gave you a dud spell.

2648
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:33,690
Should I try?

2649
02:25:33,950 --> 02:25:34,530
Whisp.

2650
02:25:35,130 --> 02:25:37,110
You guys hate me.

2651
02:25:37,790 --> 02:25:38,410
Whisp.

2652
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:41,190
Whisp.

2653
02:25:42,190 --> 02:25:43,390
It worked for me before.

2654
02:25:44,310 --> 02:25:44,630
Whisp.

2655
02:25:46,090 --> 02:25:46,730
Whisp.

2656
02:25:47,390 --> 02:25:48,030
Okay.

2657
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:48,610
Okay.

2658
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:49,330
I can't do it.

2659
02:25:49,410 --> 02:25:50,270
Someone else do it.

2660
02:25:52,950 --> 02:25:53,590
Whisp.

2661
02:25:56,810 --> 02:25:58,090
Your turn.

2662
02:26:03,230 --> 02:26:03,790
Wisp!

2663
02:26:03,790 --> 02:26:06,450
It just looked nasty, I'm sorry.

2664
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:06,990
Divinely.

2665
02:26:07,990 --> 02:26:08,510
What was it?

2666
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:11,070
I'm just gonna go W, try more on the S&P?

2667
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:12,290
Wisp.

2668
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:16,590
Wait, wait, wait.

2669
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:18,130
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2670
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:18,450
Wait, wait, wait.

2671
02:26:18,450 --> 02:26:19,110
Wait, wait, what are you focused on?

2672
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:20,210
Wisp.

2673
02:26:20,670 --> 02:26:21,290
You try?

2674
02:26:21,490 --> 02:26:21,910
Wisp.

2675
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:22,750
Wisp.

2676
02:26:23,550 --> 02:26:24,110
Wisp.

2677
02:26:24,630 --> 02:26:25,150
Wisp.

2678
02:26:26,470 --> 02:26:26,870
Wisp.

2679
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:28,790
Yeah, it's like a rock.

2680
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:29,850
A rock.

2681
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:29,870
A rock.

2682
02:26:34,790 --> 02:26:35,190
Whisp.

2683
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:36,330
Oh, mine's dead.

2684
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:37,470
Whisp.

2685
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:38,630
Is it dead?

2686
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:39,030
I can tell.

2687
02:26:39,230 --> 02:26:39,810
Divine light.

2688
02:26:40,670 --> 02:26:40,790
Yeah.

2689
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:41,670
It's still, I can tell.

2690
02:26:41,670 --> 02:26:41,750
Yeah.

2691
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:43,770
It's like, it's like a whipped cream, like.

2692
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:44,290
Whisp.

2693
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:45,070
Whisp.

2694
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:45,850
Whisp.

2695
02:26:47,490 --> 02:26:48,290
Go fast.

2696
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:49,010
Try faster.

2697
02:26:49,390 --> 02:26:49,690
Whisp.

2698
02:26:50,310 --> 02:26:50,730
There you go.

2699
02:26:50,850 --> 02:26:51,270
Yeah, yeah.

2700
02:26:52,170 --> 02:26:54,390
What the fuck does this spell even do?

2701
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:55,390
I don't know.

2702
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:58,130
It's like a very small amount of trash to your enemies or something.

2703
02:26:58,910 --> 02:26:58,950
Yeah.

2704
02:26:59,170 --> 02:26:59,790
Divine light.

2705
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:01,350
behind someone.

2706
02:27:01,590 --> 02:27:02,650
Thank you.

2707
02:27:06,690 --> 02:27:07,650
Divine light.

2708
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:10,390
Divine light.

2709
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:11,750
I can't try to snipe them out of the sky.

2710
02:27:13,270 --> 02:27:13,690
Whisp.

2711
02:27:15,730 --> 02:27:19,810
Oh, it slows you down a little too.

2712
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:21,910
Okay, I think spells gives me such power.

2713
02:27:22,090 --> 02:27:22,770
I really do think.

2714
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:23,570
Yeah.

2715
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:27,510
Have you guys ever larped like IRL?

2716
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:29,510
Oh my god, no.

2717
02:27:30,650 --> 02:27:48,710
it's very similar to this i haven't done it in real life but i remember when i was a kid all the kids that like pokemon and dragon ball would like run around the playground shouting attack names and stuff and acting it out with their bodies yeah yeah A sorcerer has been slain.

2718
02:27:49,810 --> 02:27:52,470
Two sorcerers have been slain.

2719
02:27:53,570 --> 02:27:55,590
I kind of saw that.

2720
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:57,450
Oh,

2721
02:28:00,570 --> 02:28:02,870
I just saw Limu spawn over there.

2722
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:03,950
Limu!

2723
02:28:04,890 --> 02:28:05,530
Oh!

2724
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:10,190
I mean, I could get everything in here.

2725
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:13,410
Hi, man.

2726
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:14,130
Hi!

2727
02:28:14,570 --> 02:28:14,890
Oh.

2728
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:17,650
I'm trying to get some more spells.

2729
02:28:18,030 --> 02:28:20,210
Do you want to kill Doki together and then stop?

2730
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,950
Yeah, that sounds good.

2731
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,430
Oh, well, um, hold on.

2732
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:24,390
I think I'm about to die.

2733
02:28:25,390 --> 02:28:26,170
Please don't die.

2734
02:28:26,310 --> 02:28:26,630
Don't die.

2735
02:28:26,770 --> 02:28:27,270
I'd miss you.

2736
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:28,010
Oh, yeah.

2737
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:29,110
Ah.

2738
02:28:30,390 --> 02:28:30,730
Alright.

2739
02:28:30,890 --> 02:28:31,790
Oh, there we go.

2740
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:33,070
Oh, hey.

2741
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:34,010
Let's kill her.

2742
02:28:35,310 --> 02:28:35,710
Okay.

2743
02:28:38,010 --> 02:28:39,130
I hear her.

2744
02:28:40,650 --> 02:28:41,130
Yeah.

2745
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:48,410
Our words with blast and...

2746
02:28:50,350 --> 02:28:52,430
Thumb blast.

2747
02:28:54,330 --> 02:28:54,950
Fireball.

2748
02:28:58,030 --> 02:28:59,250
Fireball.

2749
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:01,110
The firelight.

2750
02:29:01,590 --> 02:29:02,200
Missile.

2751
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:05,070
Oh, not fireball.

2752
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:09,610
Very good.

2753
02:29:10,610 --> 02:29:11,110
Yay!

2754
02:29:13,870 --> 02:29:15,410
Oh, I want my stuff back.

2755
02:29:16,030 --> 02:29:16,550
Where'd it go?

2756
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:19,770
Why does Doki have an orb?

2757
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:22,210
What is that?

2758
02:29:22,330 --> 02:29:23,710
I saw her holding it.

2759
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:25,370
Yeah, I don't know.

2760
02:29:26,110 --> 02:29:26,710
Consult the orb.

2761
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:29,030
Oh, can we combine it?

2762
02:29:29,050 --> 02:29:29,330
Oh, it does.

2763
02:29:30,150 --> 02:29:30,710
I don't know.

2764
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:31,770
You can touch it.

2765
02:29:32,050 --> 02:29:33,230
Grasp orb.

2766
02:29:34,270 --> 02:29:34,510
Whoa.

2767
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:35,270
Founder it.

2768
02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:37,250
I'm going to go home and I'm going to use it.

2769
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:38,810
Okay.

2770
02:29:40,990 --> 02:29:41,830
Oh, no, we're stuck.

2771
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:49,280
What is that?

2772
02:29:49,360 --> 02:29:50,480
Flying into the sky.

2773
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:50,900
Wow.

2774
02:29:52,060 --> 02:29:52,380
Hello?

2775
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:53,320
Hello?

2776
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:54,640
Hello?

2777
02:29:55,540 --> 02:29:55,820
Hi!

2778
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:56,460
What?

2779
02:29:57,580 --> 02:29:58,540
Who's in the sky?

2780
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:00,460
I- I saw someone in the sky!

2781
02:30:08,290 --> 02:30:09,490
Doesn't do anything.

2782
02:30:10,350 --> 02:30:11,930
Make it a soup, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2783
02:30:12,910 --> 02:30:17,010
Make me an ingredient, and I'll make you a powerful magical soup.

2784
02:30:17,170 --> 02:30:18,930
Yeah, yeah, soup the orb, soup the orb.

2785
02:30:20,130 --> 02:30:22,030
I want to consume the orb, please.

2786
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:27,630
I don't know what to- wait!

2787
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:33,750
I'm seeing someone's POV.

2788
02:30:39,350 --> 02:30:41,010
Wait, that's kind of cool.

2789
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:42,670
If I...

2790
02:30:42,670 --> 02:30:47,230
Their warlocks have captured the crystal caverns.

2791
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:47,870
Whoa!

2792
02:30:49,110 --> 02:30:49,470
Whoa!

2793
02:30:49,890 --> 02:30:49,970
Oh.

2794
02:30:56,350 --> 02:30:59,310
Um, we were supposed to stop playing the game.

2797
02:31:39,970 --> 02:31:40,830
Oh, they're all back!

2798
02:31:40,850 --> 02:31:41,830
Oh, they did come back.

2799
02:31:41,970 --> 02:31:42,470
They're here.

2800
02:31:42,590 --> 02:31:43,250
Oh, they did!

2801
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:46,390
Dark Blast.

2802
02:31:48,910 --> 02:31:50,070
Oh my god!

2803
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:53,730
You killed the guy!

2804
02:31:54,470 --> 02:31:55,770
What did he do to you?

2805
02:31:56,950 --> 02:32:00,210
Dookie can't leave no one to trade anymore because you killed his friend.

2806
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:02,730
Wait, Dookie, did you ponder the orb?

2807
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:04,770
Yeah, I pondered the orb.

2808
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:06,810
You can basically like stream snipe up the enemy.

2809
02:32:07,030 --> 02:32:07,870
Yeah, it's crazy.

2810
02:32:09,010 --> 02:32:09,230
Yeah.

2811
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:13,590
I mean, I could just pull up your stream instead, but like, yeah, it's pretty...

2812
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:16,430
Oh, I mean, that takes a lot of effort, I think.

2813
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:21,190
Whisp.

2814
02:32:21,350 --> 02:32:21,950
What did you do?

2815
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:23,270
That was the Whisp.

2816
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:25,070
Oh, that was the Whisp.

2817
02:32:25,150 --> 02:32:25,510
The Whisp.

2818
02:32:25,730 --> 02:32:26,790
Sending out the Whisp.

2819
02:32:28,090 --> 02:32:29,510
Do we want to call it here?

2820
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:31,390
Wait.

2821
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:33,930
I think that's all the stealthy one last train.

2822
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:34,750
Yeah, seems like it.

2823
02:32:34,770 --> 02:32:36,490
Yeah, that works for me.

2824
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:38,970
One last spell trade.

2825
02:32:40,190 --> 02:32:41,830
They won't give me anything but they and frogs.

2826
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:43,750
They just give me mushrooms.

2827
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:46,370
I wish we did not kill the majority of these people.

2828
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:50,110
Hidden blast.

2829
02:32:53,550 --> 02:32:55,090
What was that?

2830
02:32:57,170 --> 02:32:58,510
It's just a dark glass.

2831
02:32:58,830 --> 02:32:58,850
Oh.

2832
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:01,370
Dark glass.

2833
02:33:05,810 --> 02:33:06,310
Close.

2834
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:10,230
I think you guys were like, I think you missed a goblin.

2835
02:33:11,130 --> 02:33:11,630
Oh!

2836
02:33:13,570 --> 02:33:14,410
Yes, please!

2837
02:33:15,630 --> 02:33:16,490
Hey, give me the thing!

2838
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:18,050
Dark blast.

2839
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:23,470
Fireball.

2840
02:33:27,550 --> 02:33:28,850
It was collateral damage.

2841
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:29,410
My bad.

2842
02:33:35,890 --> 02:33:42,630
There are all dead oh my god she's so loud he's like muted her

2843
02:33:56,990 --> 02:34:11,850

2844
02:34:12,130 --> 02:34:13,550
No, no, no.

2845
02:34:13,870 --> 02:34:16,210
He's like living the same day every day.

2846
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:16,650
It's one.

2847
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:19,110
Dark Blast.

2848
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:23,190
Lincoln Doki, a dark Blast each.

2849
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:25,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

2850
02:34:25,410 --> 02:34:26,090
They have to 1v1.

2851
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:27,950
Russian, we're left.

2852
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:34,350
I hope the dark Blast all gets tight in a circle together and we all just fireball each other, like fireball into the center together.

2853
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:35,110
Right now?

02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:19,700
I hope it updates more.

2903
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:20,880
More tools and shit.

2904
02:37:21,220 --> 02:37:22,420
I want emotes.

2905
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:23,440
I want emotes.

2906
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:24,260
Oh, yeah.

2907
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:24,680
Yeah.

2908
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,080
More spells.

2909
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:26,820
Yeah.

2910
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:27,280
Yeah.

2911
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:28,680
More spells would be really cool.

2912
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:31,440
I thought that it was developed by one guy.

2913
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:32,680
Oh, really?

2914
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:33,700
Yeah.

2915
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,960
Like, It'd be cool to have like a horse.

2916
02:37:38,140 --> 02:38:46,660
or like a broomstick a broomstick you just rode right up on your horse and just go fireball and then ride away you could do that with the frog balloon yeah that's so true okay that was okay the anti-air shit of all three of you guys like he's shooting fireballs in place does that mean this guy I literally I saw you in the distance and i thought you were like just having fun and like trying to like like you know my eyes when i saw you i saw goki like flying in the air and you guys shooting off fireballs and i was like oh my god look they're trying to shoot off fire expert doki oh my god then i get closer it's definitely what we were doing yeah yeah and then you joined in and was like freeze and i was like what i think that was the funniest thing about that game is that sometimes it felt like more of a mafia game where two wizards just turn the corner like fireball like no you didn't hear them coming up behind you yeah just hear it simultaneously like we got you turn around we were

2917
02:38:46,660 --> 02:39:01,520
trying to get rid of the evidence and then you and like libel and mitt were like fireball fireball yeah it's so good like because you have to be so monotone it's like execution style remorseless.

2918
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:03,280
Did you guys flag that?

2919
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:06,640
It kind of felt like a paintball game.

2920
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:07,900
Like that's gotta feel like what it was.

2921
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:09,160
Like fucking paintball.

2922
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:10,060
Yeah.

2923
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:14,560
Yeah, it's like we got, there was a hit on us there.

2924
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:22,560
I'm surprised I can't hear you guys' footsteps, so it would literally just be suddenly this like villainous approach.

2925
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:23,460
Yeah.

2926
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:25,080
Sneak attack.

2927
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:27,340
Goodbye, snuff me and Doki.

2928
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:31,920
You're gonna sleep with the fishes to now Oh my god, are you kidding me?

2929
02:39:32,200 --> 02:39:34,120
It might have just done Doki V everybody.

2930
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:38,560
I can't get over the game, though.

2931
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:40,560
We're live who had six kills on us.

2932
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:41,700
It was all bad.

2933
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,940
No, I don't understand.

2934
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:45,080
It was like, we have no British support.

2935
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:47,780
I feel like there was no American support.

2936
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:56,940
Clearly, the way to be like, you know, like Celestial in that fucking game is to have an American-British hybrid accent.

2937
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:58,140
That's the key.

2938
02:39:58,620 --> 02:39:59,340
Yeah, like, everything.

2939
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:00,620
most wizard tone.

2940
02:40:00,820 --> 02:40:03,340
Every word you say, the game registers.

2941
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:07,100
And then it took Min and I like five times to say one thing.

2942
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:09,540
I never liked my fireball.

2943
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:10,460
I don't know why.

2944
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:13,580
Yeah, I would be like fireball and it would just be like, nah.

2945
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:15,100
I would be like fireball.

2946
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:17,320
Then she shoots like seven fireballs at us.

2947
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:19,740
Go back to Hogwarts, idiot.

2948
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:22,600
Love you, son.

2949
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:23,880
Love you, son.

2950
02:40:24,900 --> 02:40:26,360
You gotta repeat your first.

2951
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:27,660
It's fireball, not fireball.

2952
02:40:27,660 --> 02:40:29,360
I think I know who's a Hufflepuff here.

2953
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:30,400
isn't it?

2954
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:34,780
Is there any English learner is trying to play this game?

2955
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:35,860
Oh my gosh.

2956
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:40,320
The first time we will practice on British English.

2957
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:42,040
Aluminum.

2958
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:43,320
Aluminium.

2959
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:44,780
Aluminium.

2960
02:40:44,900 --> 02:40:45,700
That's what it is.

2961
02:40:46,220 --> 02:40:46,600
Aluminium.

2962
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:48,460
Aluminium.

2963
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:54,620
You're going to be out here going 40 water bottles in my aluminium cup.

2964
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,560
All approximately 30 degrees Celsius.

2965
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:29,820
oh god it's looking hot no thank you the warmest water it's a hot day outside i don't know i wonder if the game would register my voice more if i put it on indian mode i think i think another streamer had to do that so maybe oh my like for different languages and stuff they have like there's like an act there's like a different they have like an accent you could change the game um to like to like indian english oh Oh,

2966
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:30,820
Indian accent.

2967
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:32,520
That's kind of cool.

2968
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:34,220
I feel like I have a vocal support.

2969
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:41,720
Yeah, you guys don't really, like, strike me as people with, like, I mean, like, we all have different ways of speaking, but I didn't say, like, accent.

2970
02:41:42,740 --> 02:41:42,780
Yeah.

2971
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:49,180
I think it was just weird, because even me for Fireball, I have, like, people say I have a Midwestern accent.

2972
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:52,040
I have to be like, a Midwestern accent.

2973
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:56,600
A child would probably say so.

2974
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:59,380
They'll be like, oh, yeah, I can hear that from Snuffy, and I'll just stand up.

2975
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:01,780
they're like, what does that mean?

2976
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:05,560
What does midwestern accidentally... Wait, they say...

2977
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:06,880
Oh.

2978
02:42:08,100 --> 02:42:08,260
What?

2979
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:10,000
Midwestern.

2980
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:11,700
No, I have no idea.

2981
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:13,320
Oh.

2982
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:14,660
Oh, oh.

2983
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:16,320
Yeah, it's still Fireball.

2984
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:17,180
Don't you know.

2985
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:18,660
Yeah, I know Mint.

2986
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:21,960
I know Mint has played Lifeline, but has Doki yet?

2987
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:23,460
Doki, have you played Lifeline yet?

2988
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:24,300
Oh, my God.

2989
02:42:24,780 --> 02:42:27,240
No, Doki, you need to play Lifeline.

2990
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:55,220
Nope, you need to play lifeline i was like lifeline from apex like no yeah no it's like a really old game with voice it's like it's a voice controlled ps2 game and that that game will make you doubt the way that you say any words ever in the english language it will just make you feel like you're just speaking a completely different language oh oh i did that with hey you pikachu and pikachu made me feel like I was schizophrenic.

2991
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,640
Like literally nothing on my side.

2992
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:57,700
He just stared at me.

2993
02:42:58,400 --> 02:42:59,980
I tried to play that fish game.

2994
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:03,840
What was it the, where you raise a human fish face guy?

2995
02:43:05,140 --> 02:43:07,940
Oh my God, yeah, I've seen that.

2996
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:08,820
Yeah, yeah.

2997
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:09,200
What's that?

2998
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:09,920
It did not work.

2999
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:12,620
For some reason, I could not get the microphone to work.

3000
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:16,460
And then I just raised all the fish and then I just let all the fishes die in the table.

3001
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,460
Oh, please.

3002
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:19,420
Yeah, that was Sea Man, I think.

3003
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:22,160
That's like a real, yeah, it was Sea Man in like 1999.

3004
02:43:22,940 --> 02:43:23,340
Yeah.

3005
02:43:23,340 --> 02:43:37,480

What if that's the devs face?

3011
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:06,040
Somebody said they poop out of their dangler.

Wait, the human fish?

3015
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:20,420

3016
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:22,600
