1
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,800
Welcome!

2
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,980
Oh my gosh, is that...

3
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,560
Bit Phantom of Ayami Family Collabo Cafe 2 fame?

4
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,240
Is that her?

5
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,520
The real deal?

6
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,120
Oh my gosh.

7
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,300
Can I...

8
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,720
No autographs.

9
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,620
Sorry.

10
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,200
No autographs.

11
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,160
Sorry.

12
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,640
Welcome back.

13
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,340
Happy Minto Day.

14
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
Happy Minto Day!

15
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,820
It's real.

16
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,360
Actually.

17
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,180
It's the real.

18
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,180
It's the realest.

19
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,660
Minto Day.

20
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,000
It's definitely today.

21
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,380
It's definitely right now.

22
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm definitely not a day or two, depending on your time zone, late.

23
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,060
No,

24
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm not singing Invisible by Duran Duran!

25
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,570
It's not even from Metal Gear!

26
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Everyday is Minto Day.

27
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,140
Really?

28
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,920
March 10th is Minto Day and March 11th is Minky Day.

29
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:31,980
Minky...

30
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,800
Would there be a Minky Day?

31
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,060
I'm not sure actually.

32
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
They shouldn't be separated.

33
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,960
You know, I think I agree.

34
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
I think I agree.

35
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,680
They shouldn't be separated.

36
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,260
Anyway, for those everybody who does not know.

37
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,040
I just got back from a trip from Japan.

38
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,760
I was there for like a week and a half.

39
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,040
And...

40
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,700
And...

41
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,280
I turned off the sounds.

42
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,560
I can still see them.

43
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,540
But I turned off the sounds.

44
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,400
And...

45
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,060
Boy, are her arms tired.

46
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,960
And hot dog.

47
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,140
And hot dog.

48
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
She's hungover.

49
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,920
Oh yeah, totally.

50
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,780
I've never been so litty in my whole afterlife.

51
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,720
Except, yeah, I'm hungover from all that airplane wine.

52
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Oh yeah.

53
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,300
Though, I don't drink much, but I went to...

54
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,700
I went to a bar.

55
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,000
I know, crazy.

56
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,940
And I got an oolong high.

57
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,940
And I didn't even feel a thing.

58
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,360
OMG, a bar.

59
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,040
I know!

60
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,640
Was it enjoyable?

61
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,920
Yeah, it tasted just like oolong tea.

62
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,560
So I was like, oh, okay.

63
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,060
I feel like I could understand why people get so drunk.

64
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,020
Mistolerance over here.

65
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,180
But you're only 17.

66
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,560
The person I possessed was not...

67
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,700
Also, I'm not 17.

68
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,580
I'm 19.

69
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,560
Which is probably...

70
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,300
Is probably...

71
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,440
Fine.

72
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,320
Spoiler, it was just tea.

73
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,280
I don't think they would rip me off.

74
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,400
Japan is 20.

75
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm so close.

76
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,740
In spirit.

77
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,280
In spirit.

78
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,660
Short pour?

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,760
What's that mean?

80
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,900
Like a little bit?

81
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,360
They could've.

82
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,660
You've been 19 for long enough.

83
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Hit that... Cue the Twilight meme.

84
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,000
How old are you?

85
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,380
19.

86
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,500
How long have you been 19?

87
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
A while.

88
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
OMG, thank you guys for all the superchats!

89
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Thank you!

90
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,680
Thank you so much for the hukasupo.

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,160
Suffering Mad Fomo.

92
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,120
The cafe!

93
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,900
I'm sorry for everybody who couldn't go.

94
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,040
But lots of people did go.

95
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
And I'm like...

96
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm 19, you guys.

97
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,300
I'm 19.

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm 19.

99
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,720
It doesn't matter how many times I've been 19, okay?

100
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,500
Ghost time passes differently, okay?

101
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,300
Don't worry about it.

102
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,520
And let's not put random ages in the chat.

103
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,300
I think that's weird.

104
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,940
I think that's weird.

105
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,460
Let's not do that.

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,140
Let's only focus on 19.

107
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,060
Thank you!

108
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
Anyway.

109
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,120
It's Minto day.

110
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,860
And I just got back yesterday.

111
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,760
The collab cafe.

112
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,240
It's been absolutely so crazy.

113
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,060
Hold on, I put my glasses on.

114
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,860
Because I was like, I'm gonna...

115
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,980
I was like, I'm gonna do a little... I was gonna sing first.

116
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
And I felt like the glasses belonged to the song.

117
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,260
But then I changed my mind.

118
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,580
I'm still jet lagging.

119
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Hangover glasses.

120
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,640
You guys, I'm so drunk.

121
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,560
Wait, no.

122
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,260
Hangover is not...

123
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,660
We're a hangover.

124
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,720
Are you...

125
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,240
It's not drunk.

126
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:39,820
Right?

127
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,210
Look how red her eyes are.

128
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,910
It's a headache.

129
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,450
It can be.

130
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,250
It's a...

131
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,890
Oh, it's dehydrated.

132
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,310
Oh.

133
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,030
I was expecting bloodshot eyes from watching Mufasa.

134
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,550
You guys, I watched Mufasa and I took notes.

135
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,250
Let me get my notes.

136
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:06,790
Hold on.

137
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,970
I took notes when I watched Mufasa so that I wouldn't forget what I had to talk about.

138
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,010
Note.

139
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,430
Note.

140
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,620
First of all though, my flight to Japan was so cursed.

141
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,520
It was extremely cursed because...

142
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,660
There was a lady for like...

143
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,700
Probably 90% of the plane.

144
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,060
She kept the window open.

145
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,580
And I'm like, hey lady.

146
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
The sun is not going to go down.

147
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
You're not going to catch that beautiful sunset.

148
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
You're not even going to catch a view.

149
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,940
There's nothing to see.

150
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,120
Please.

151
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,860
And then she was like reading her book with it open.

152
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,440
The entire time.

153
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,980
And I was like, there are overhead lights.

154
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,760
But, here's the kicker.

155
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,160
She...

156
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,980
Here, let me draw a picture for you guys.

157
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,460
Like literally.

158
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm going to window capture.

159
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,540
Hold on.

160
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Window capture.

161
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,220
Oh wait.

162
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't remember how to stream anymore.

163
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,880
Window capture.

164
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,680
Paint.

165
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,210
I don't remember.

166
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,190
It feels like I've been gone for a whole month.

167
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,370
It's craziness.

168
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,530
Okay, so...

169
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,710
Alright.

170
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,270
Okay, so...

171
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,570
So, here...

172
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,270
Here...

173
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,300
So my plane was like the type where it's like...

174
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,230
Two seats.

175
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,510
And then in the middle, there's like the row.

176
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,450
Right?

177
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,390
There's the row and then there's like three seats.

178
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,070
Or however many.

179
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,450
And another row.

180
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,410
I couldn't tell you which plane it was.

181
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,990
Usually I look up which plane it is.

182
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,970
Like if it's an Airbus or whatever.

183
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,630
So it was like this.

184
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,110
Sounds like a 747.

185
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,950
It might have been.

186
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,750
It might have been.

187
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,190
Is this lost?

188
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,130
So the seats were like this.

189
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,110
The seats were like this.

190
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,270
The seats were like this.

191
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,190
Anyway.

192
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,910
Ah, Minto...

193
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,650
Was here.

194
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,130
Right?

195
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,470
So I have an aisle seat.

196
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,610
But I'm also, you know...

197
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,150
Not next to the lady.

198
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,870
And this lady here...

199
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,850
Her window is wide open.

200
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,810
The sun is shining in to my entire row.

201
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,510
My entire row was getting flashbanged.

202
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,690
She also...

203
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,570
Hold on.

204
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,770
Before I get ahead of myself.

205
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,370
Is this Frogger?

206
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,350
Yes.

207
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,610
So I...

208
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,010
So lady goes up to the bathroom, right?

209
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,430
And I ask her, this lady here.

210
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,350
I was like, can you please...

211
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,990
Shut the window?

212
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,110
Please?

213
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,750
And she was just like, yeah, I don't know why she has it open.

214
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,790
First of all, usually the flight attendants say like...

215
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,730
Hey, even on my flight coming back they were like...

216
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,350
Hey, we need everybody to close the windows because it's gonna get bright.

217
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,050
I was just like, why didn't they ask her?

218
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,290
I don't understand.

219
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,410
And...

220
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:01,690
So...

221
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,530
She shuts it after I ask.

222
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,830
And then the girl comes back and it hasn't shut for a while.

223
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,830
And then she'll like do the thing where she like cracks it.

224
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,450
And then she does...

225
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,710
What?

226
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,910
What's wrong with my mouse?

227
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,650
Why is it not...

228
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,430
What the...

229
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,370
I'm dragging it.

230
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,030
Usually I see...

231
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,990
Oh, there's a drag.

232
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,930
Drag.

233
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:23,650
See?

234
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,210
What's wrong with my mouse?

235
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:25,910
Uh-oh.

236
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,210
Uh-oh.

237
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,310
Uh-oh.

238
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:29,930
Uh-oh.

239
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,850
My mouse is jet lagged too, yeah.

240
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,710
Oh no.

241
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,110
What's wrong with my mouse?

242
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,150
Okay, this is for another time.

243
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,490
Battery?

244
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,070
No, I just charged it.

245
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,470
I'll plug it in anyway.

246
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:45,550
Okay.

247
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,680
I'll plug it in anyway.

248
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,160
It's plugged up.

249
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,540
It's currently plugged up.

250
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,160
Uh-oh.

251
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,660
No!

252
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,380
First my car dies.

253
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,460
Then my mouse dies.

254
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,700
What's happening?

255
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,320
Your car died?

256
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,700
Oh yeah, that's another story.

257
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,820
Anyway, okay.

258
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,760
So she'll like crack it halfway and then like just...

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,900
Until it's bright, bright, bright.

260
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,660
Full brightness.

261
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,300
Everybody in my row.

262
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,660
But here's the kicker.

263
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,300
There was another guy on this side.

264
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,940
He also had his own window, right?

265
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,420
Because that's how planes work.

266
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,960
And he...

267
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,300
Hold on, let me move everything over.

268
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,200
He would look over at the girl sitting here.

269
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,880
He would look over at the girl sitting there and be like...

270
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,260
And I would watch him.

271
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,160
I would watch him do this.

272
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,300
He'd look over and be like...

273
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,820
Her window is open.

274
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,720
There must be something interesting outside.

275
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,660
Let me open my window too.

276
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,600
And so...

277
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,840
So...

278
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,980
They would...

279
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,620
They would constantly be opening and closing the windows.

280
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,560
And so I'm getting flashbanged from both sides.

281
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,520
And here's the kicker too.

282
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,440
Is that they're the only two people on the entire whole-ass plane that had their windows open.

283
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
Just my row!

284
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,760
Just my row.

285
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
And then...

286
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,840
And then...

287
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,120
I'm like okay.

288
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,140
I sleep.

289
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,360
I'll sleep.

290
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,800
You know what?

291
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,120
Fine.

292
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,120
I sleep.

293
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,800
I sleep.

294
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,220
Oh no wait, hold on.

295
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,240
Well yeah.

296
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,380
I would sleep and like she would have just a window open and I'm like...

297
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,800
I'm gonna...

298
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,740
I'm gonna become the Joker here.

299
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,740
And I'm watching...

300
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,680
I'm watching a movie on my seat.

301
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,020
And then...

302
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,080
The...

303
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,040
The movie stops working.

304
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,040
My seat stops working.

305
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,580
And I was...

306
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,760
And they're like oh we have to reset the plane.

307
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,060
And they do.

308
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,880
And...

309
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
Everyone else...

310
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,640
Everyone else is happy watching their stuff.

311
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,040
She's reading.

312
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,000
She doesn't give a shit.

313
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,880
Everybody else is happy watching their plane movies.

314
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,080
Except my row.

315
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,100
Reset the plane?

316
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,480
Yeah!

317
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,840
They've never had to do that before?

318
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,180
They've never had to reset the system on the plane?

319
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
They had to do it three times.

320
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,720
It was a setup.

321
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,520
It was!

322
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,700
And so now...

323
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,540
I'm like okay I have no entertainment.

324
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,420
I wanted to watch a movie.

325
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,060
I was so close to finishing a movie.

326
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,180
And then...

327
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,060
I was...

328
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,740
Then...

329
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,200
When it rebooted the second time...

330
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,060
It was in like...

331
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,120
How do I say?

332
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,380
Like a...

333
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,660
You know when something reboots and it's not in full capacity working?

334
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,020
It's like a safety mode kind of deal?

335
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,540
It had like a limited selection of movies.

336
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,900
So I was like okay I'll pick one of these.

337
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,340
And then they were like we're gonna...

338
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,520
We're gonna reset again.

339
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,500
And then it just crashed completely.

340
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
And so I couldn't watch anything.

341
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,840
So I couldn't finish both movies.

342
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,580
And I couldn't sleep because I'm getting flashbanged.

343
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,000
By the sun.

344
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,580
It was just...

345
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,020
On the way back it was so funny because...

346
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,060
Because I was waiting in line for security.

347
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,700
And there was this guy who was just like chatting up these two girls in front of me.

348
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,040
In security line.

349
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,540
And he kept being like...

350
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,320
He definitely did not know them.

351
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,660
He was just talking to them.

352
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
And he was like several people in front of them, you know?

353
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,460
I don't know.

354
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,380
I don't know why he started talking to them.

355
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,800
But he was just like...

356
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,380
He was like you guys just gotta raw dog the flight.

357
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,620
You guys just gotta raw dog it.

358
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,860
No entertainment.

359
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,220
No...

360
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,520
No books.

361
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,140
No nothing.

362
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,600
You just gotta raw dog it.

363
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,660
And then as soon as they got away from the guy...

364
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,040
Where he...

365
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,660
Because the line kind of looped around or whatever.

366
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
And they were like...

367
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,300
Together they were like...

368
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,640
Why did he say that?

369
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,040
Does he know what raw dog means?

370
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,540
I was having like a flashback moment.

371
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,460
I was like...

372
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,060
They were like...

373
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,380
Why would he say that to us?

374
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,880
Doesn't he know what raw dogging means?

375
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Why would he say that?

376
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,980
And he just kept saying it really loudly.

377
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,600
He was like...

378
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,180
You gotta raw dog the flight.

379
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,940
You just gotta raw dog it.

380
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,780
So that was...

381
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,220
That was my flight experience on the way there.

382
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,200
How did I get on that topic?

383
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,400
I don't know.

384
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,670
Oh, Mufasa!

385
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,770
Thank you.

386
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,850
Yeah, I watched Mufasa.

387
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,310
Oh!

388
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,330
I know what I was gonna say.

389
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,510
The first movie I was watching was...

390
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,230
I don't remember what it was called.

391
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,330
But it was about this lady who like...

392
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,230
Is a language professor and she's talking to...

393
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,170
The aliens and trying to figure out their language and what they want.

394
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,730
And I was like kind of invested in it.

395
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,050
I was like, oh, this is so interesting.

396
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,290
Arrival!

397
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,610
No spoilers because I never got to finish the movie.

399
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,990
And so I left in February, right?

400
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,130
And when I came back, it was March, right?

401
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,470
So they had updated...

402
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,470
They had updated the movies...

403
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,710
In the system.

404
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,170
I guess which one was removed.

405
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:19,950
I

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,240
never even got to finish it.

407
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,800
I never got to finish it.

408
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,940
Usually on trips, I'll like...

409
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,860
If I don't get to finish a movie, I'll continue where I left off on the way back, but...

410
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
You had the whole flight there.

411
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,480
What are you talking about?

412
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,400
What are you talking about?

413
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,420
The system went down.

414
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,400
It's not my fault?

415
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,200
Watch along maybe.

416
00:22:59,580 --> 00:22:59,980
I don't know.

417
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,320
I have like 30 minutes left of it.

418
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,640
Meet me in the toilets if y'all want to watch this stream.

419
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,360
No!

420
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,720
No!

421
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,760
Read?

422
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,800
Oh, you read.

423
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,120
I thought you said just read.

424
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,640
I was like, a book I don't have?

425
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,640
But anyway, Mufasa.

426
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,180
So I was able to watch that.

427
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,160
I watched Mufasa.

428
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,680
I watched...

429
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,540
Moana 2.

430
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,080
I watched...

431
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,960
I tried watching that Emilia Perez movie.

432
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,940
I fell asleep.

433
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,160
And then I tried watching Deadpool Wolverine.

434
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
I fell asleep.

435
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,540
So I didn't...

436
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,230
So I didn't watch either of those.

437
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,950
I think I like, fell asleep at the very beginning of Deadpool.

438
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,290
I woke up to the credits.

439
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,750
Like I literally...

440
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,290
I literally slept through the entire thing.

441
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,170
And I only wanted to watch Emilia Perez because I heard of how bad it was.

442
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,210
And the music the very beginning...

443
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,150
The music was just so bad at the beginning.

444
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:22,710
I was...

445
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,230
Actually, no.

446
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,170
I didn't fall asleep during Emilia Perez.

447
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,750
I turned it off because...

448
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,010
Because it was so bad.

449
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,010
I was like, I can't listen to this.

450
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,190
I don't...

451
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,430
It's so terrible.

452
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,770
But, yeah.

453
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,070
Hate watching.

454
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,350
I wouldn't say hate watching.

455
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,750
I just want to know...

456
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,310
You know?

457
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,690
I just want to know what's it all about.

458
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,930
The only thing I know from that movie is the...

459
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,750
The part where he's just like...

460
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,170
Blah, blah, Plastias.

461
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,110
Blah, blah, blah, Plastias.

462
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,610
Blah, blah, blah, Plastias.

463
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,570
Blah, blah, blah, Plastias.

464
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,030
Blah, blah, blah, Plastias.

465
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,090
Blah, blah, blah, Plastias.

466
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,690
Blah, blah, blah, Plastias.

467
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,570
But you know what's also stupid is Mufasa.

468
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:23,830
Which...

469
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,650
Oh my gosh guys, this is a karaoke and I'm not just singing at all.

470
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,430
Okay, let's sing Mufasa.

471
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,470
Let's sing Mufasa's song and then I'll talk about Mufasa.

472
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,630
Wait, how do I look up Mufasa?

473
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,770
That movie was so bad.

474
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,270
Oh, this song sucks.

475
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,570
It's Mads Mikkelsen?

476
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,490
No.

477
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,810
No.

478
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,210
What?

479
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,530
No.

480
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,950
Mufasa movie.

481
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,650
Mads Mikkelsen.

482
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,630
No.

483
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,090
No.

484
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,230
He sings the worst song.

485
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,270
Not Mads Mikkelsen.

486
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,650
No.

487
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,370
Are you kidding me?

488
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,850
There's a song in the movie that's worse than the brother song.

489
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,890
You guys, you wouldn't believe me.

490
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,450
But it's worse than the brother song.

491
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,650
I didn't know that was him.

492
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,210
He's actually a good singer.

493
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,910
The song is so bad.

494
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,070
It's so terrible.

495
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,230
Did he play Scar?

496
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,510
No, he played the villain in the movie.

497
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,250
Which is a guy named...

498
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,410
Hold on, I just googled it.

499
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:35,930
Akiros.

500
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,470
Oh my gosh, okay.

501
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,930
Let's sing a song.

502
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,850
Let's sing...

503
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,930
You know what, I don't know how this song goes, but I know that...

504
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,810
I'll sing...

505
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,350
This is the one he sings.

506
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,150
It's so bad.

507
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,630
This is my warm-up song, okay guys?

508
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,990
I think I remember how...

509
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,190
Wait.

510
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:04,090
You say you're the king, but you lie around in the shade.

511
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,370
Out of shape, unafraid.

512
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,010
The moon.

513
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,770
I'm gonna put on the...

514
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,610
What's the sound with the background vocals on it?

515
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,690
Here, you can sing.

516
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,470
I'm gonna be the last thing you see.

517
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,030
Before you go, bye bye.

518
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,430
There you go.

519
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,390
Bye bye.

520
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,010
Climb every tree.

521
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,450
Across land and sea.

522
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,950
I'll make you go, bye bye.

523
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,210
I'll make you go, bye bye.

524
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,910
Everything that I touch is...

525
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,350
I don't know how to...

526
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,650
That's another thing I hated about the movie.

527
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,910
They're always just like...

528
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,950
A circle of life.

529
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:02,950
Like I get it.

530
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,910
Good Lion King.

531
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,790
Stop stealing glances.

532
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,950
They don't like your chances.

533
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,450
And neither do I.

534
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,730
I run my pride.

535
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,330
You run and hide.

536
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,250
Cause I'm gonna be the last thing you see.

537
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,010
Before you go, bye bye.

538
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,130
Climb every tree.

539
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,150
Across land and sea.

540
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:32,970
There you go.

541
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:33,790
Bye bye.

542
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,130
Before you go, bye bye.

543
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,350
Bye bye.

544
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,950
I'm the last of my line.

545
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,190
I must be strong.

546
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,910
Bye bye.

547
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,110
I'll make you go, bye bye.

548
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,500
So bad.

549
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,240
Please tell me the song is called Bye Bye.

550
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,640
Would you...

551
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,440
How much you wanna bet for that?

552
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,040
Bye bye.

553
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,160
I'll make you go, bye bye.

554
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,620
It's so bad.

555
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,100
Also, I can't tell the lions apart.

556
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
It's too difficult.

557
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,320
It's too hard to know.

558
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,920
Never sing a song from Mufasa again?

559
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,010
Wait, what?

560
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,430
A broadcast?

561
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,270
Does it know I'm streaming?

562
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,690
I could sing it in Dutch.

563
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,250
You want me to sing Bye Bye in Dutch?

564
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,830
Rosie, thank you so much for the Akusuba.

565
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,670
Sorry, I feel like I'm missing so many superchats.

566
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,870
The chat is going by very quickly today for my jet-lagged eyes.

567
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,630
Thank you so much.

568
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,910
And then sometimes they would use this horrible...

569
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,290
Makes you appreciate Be Prepared.

570
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,830
Be Prepared is an amazing song.

571
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:18,480
They use this horrible GoPro camera on the lions when they were running sometimes.

572
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:24,290
And it's just extremely, extremely jarring and ugly.

573
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,390
And I can't tell what the expressions of the lions are.

574
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,710
And they're constantly referencing the circle of life and he lives in you.

575
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,170
I'm reading my notes.

576
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,470
I'm just like, I get it.

577
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,210
This is the Lion King.

578
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,430
I get it.

579
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,610
I get it.

580
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,670
Oh my god.

581
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:44,830
I looked it up.

582
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,090
The song is called Bye Bye.

583
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,530
Bye bye.

584
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,570
I'll make you go bye bye.

585
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,410
He says it like that.

586
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,210
And so the movie basically is...

587
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,040
It's Lion King, but...

588
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,500
It's Mufasa origin story.

589
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,480
But told by Rafiki to Simba's daughter.

590
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,180
But also Timon and Pumbaa are interrupting.

591
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,660
And they're like, not enough Timon and Pumbaa in this story.

592
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
Thank you!

593
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,090
This sounds so convoluted.

594
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:35,890
It was!

595
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,130
It is!

596
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:39,730
And...

597
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,030
So it's also Lion King 1.5.

598
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,650
Kind of, actually.

599
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,330
Kind of.

600
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,810
And it's just very strange.

601
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,150
Scar's solo song is far above the quality of the rest of the film.

602
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,470
Being a song that Lin Manuel is best at.

603
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,490
Personal character songs.

604
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,650
But it's marred by being included in the rest.

605
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,590
Yeah, Scar's solo isn't so bad.

606
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,370
And then there's also another song that like...

607
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,590
Mufasa and...

608
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,050
Female lead...

609
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,650
Sing to each other.

610
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,150
Sarabi.

611
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,790
Sing to each other.

612
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,170
And that one wasn't so bad either.

613
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,430
Female lead.

614
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,890
Speaking of Lin Manuel...

615
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,450
Miranda...

616
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,630
Moana too.

617
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,610
He didn't write any of the music for that.

618
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,130
But I didn't mind Moana too so much.

619
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,790
I think it had a lot of criticisms.

620
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,130
The music was okay.

621
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,170
It wasn't great.

622
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,230
But, oh!

623
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,310
Oh my gosh.

624
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,090
Mufasa.

625
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,950
I'm sorry.

626
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,330
Spoilers, I suppose.

627
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,330
But the reason Scar becomes evil...

628
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,310
Is because Mufasa takes his girl.

629
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,630
Or the girl that he wants to get with.

630
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,370
A lion he's known for...

631
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,330
Like two days.

632
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,990
I'm sorry, excuse me!

633
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,730
Scar's...

634
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,610
It's so lame!

635
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,370
It's actually the lamest thing...

636
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,650
I've ever seen.

637
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,190
It's so...

638
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,770
It's so horrible.

639
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,050
Because Scar is just a little...

640
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,890
Piss baby the entire time.

641
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,050
He almost watches his mom die...

642
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,910
And he doesn't do anything.

643
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,910
And then he almost watches...

644
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,750
Sarabi die...

645
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,530
And doesn't do anything.

646
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,070
And Mufasa saves both of them both times.

647
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,690
And then, when Mufasa...

648
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,970
After he saves Sarabi, he credits...

649
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,310
Scar so that she'll love him instead.

650
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,150
And still, he's unlovable.

651
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,590
He's unlovable!

652
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,030
He's the worst!

653
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,110
What happened to Scar?

654
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,970
The cool Scar from...

655
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,350
Let's sing Lion King.

656
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,720
Unlovable Scar sounds like a sitcom.

657
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,680
Actually,

658
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,770
do I know Be Prepared?

659
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,870
I don't know if I do.

660
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,690
I don't know.

661
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,050
I don't know.

662
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:47,110
Whatever, I'm warming up you guys.

663
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,910
I'm warming up.

664
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,430
I'm warming up.

665
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,430
I'm warming up first.

666
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,650
My brain is so not here.

667
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,850
Yeah, I'm not prepared at all.

668
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,690
Be prepared...

669
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,150
For scuff.

670
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,830
Isn't this my part?

671
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,950
Oh, I had to leave vocal on.

672
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,390
This doesn't sound like him at all.

673
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,210
Maybe there's a...

674
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,090
Who is this?

675
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,170
If aligned to my vision...

676
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,690
And brain...

677
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,510
I know that your powers of retention...

678
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,370
Are as wet as a warthog's backside...

679
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,370
But thick as you are...

680
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,110
Pay attention!

681
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,470
My words are a matter of pride...

682
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,330
It's clear from your vacant expressions...

683
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,910
The lights are not all on upstairs...

684
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,930
But we're talking kings and successions...

685
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,070
Even you can't be caught unawares...

686
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,850
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime...

687
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,750
Be prepared for sensational news...

688
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,970
A shining new era...

689
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,750
Is tiptoeing nearer...

690
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,610
Where we feature...

691
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,710
Just listen to teacher...

692
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,810
I know it sounds sordid...

693
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,810
But you'll be rewarded...

694
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,750
When at last I'm given my dues...

695
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,890
An injustice deliciously squared...

696
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,250
Be prepared!

697
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,380
Let me turn on the vocals for this.

698
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,180
No fool, we're gonna kill him.

699
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,540
Great idea!

700
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,640
Who needs a king?

701
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,060
Idiots!

702
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,660
There won't be a king!

703
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,120
I will be king!

704
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,180
Stick with me...

705
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,140
And you'll never go hungry again!

706
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,440
He sounds better now.

707
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,060
There's so many parts in this song.

708
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,760
Of course, quid pro quo...

709
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,390
You were expected...

710
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,510
To take certain duties on board...

711
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,410
The future is littered with prizes...

712
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,180
And though I'm the main actressee...

713
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,450
The point that I must emphasize is...

714
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,000
You won't get a sniff without me!

715
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,620
So prepare for the coup of a century...

716
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Be prepared for the murkiest scowl...

717
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,500
Meticulous planning...

718
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,620
Tenacity spanning...

719
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,740
Decadent of denial...

720
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,020
Wait, I don't think I said that right.

721
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,680
Disputed, respected, saluted...

722
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,880
And seen for the wonder that I am...

723
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,800
Guess my teeth and ambitions are bare...

724
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,540
Be prepared!

725
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:11,580
Be prepared!

726
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,000
Guess our teeth and ambitions are bare...

727
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,680
Be prepared!

728
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,160
I

729
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,980
didn't expect so much talking in that song.

730
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Okay, I think I'm warmed up enough.

731
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,740
Another thing that I did while I was in Japan was I went to Disney.

732
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,920
Of course.

733
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,600
But...

734
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,380
I literally, mentally, I'm still on the Beauty and the Beast ride.

735
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,360
I can't...

736
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,260
I can't stop myself.

737
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,300
I wake up and I'm like, wow, Beauty and the Beast ride.

738
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,740
And then I go about my day and I'm like, wow, Beauty and the Beast ride.

739
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,380
And then I go to sleep and I'm like, wow, Beauty and the Beast ride.

740
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,160
It's such a beautiful ride!

741
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,720
I love that ride so much.

742
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,740
The teapots, yes!

743
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,340
Wait, yes?

744
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,420
Yeah.

745
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,440
Yeah.

746
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,320
But you're not talking about the teacups, right?

747
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,620
You never leave the ride.

748
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,520
I'm haunting it.

749
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,820
With my mind.

750
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,140
So I'm gonna sing some Beauty and the Beast.

751
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,820
I hope that's okay.

752
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,400
I hope that's okay.

753
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,040
Just a couple songs.

754
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,000
Marseillaise, mademoiselle.

755
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,080
It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.

756
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,200
And now we invite you to relax.

757
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,500
Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents your dinner.

758
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,840
Be our guest.

759
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,020
Be our guest.

760
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Put our service to the test.

761
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,980
Tie your napkin round your neck, sherry, and we'll provide the rest.

762
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,660
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres, why we only live to serve.

763
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,760
Try the great stuff, it's delicious.

764
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,160
Don't believe me?

765
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,140
Ask the dishes.

766
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,600
They can sing, they can dance.

767
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,760
After all, miss, this is France.

768
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,280
And a dinner here is never second best.

769
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:32,640
Go on, unfold your menu, take a glance, and then you'll be our guest.

770
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,680
Oui, our guest, be our guest.

771
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,280
Livre à goût, chez Soufflé, pie and pudding on flambé.

772
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,320
We'll prepare and serve with flair a culinary cabaret.

773
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,640
You're alone and you're scared, but the banquet's all prepared.

774
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,120
No one's gloomy or complaining while the flatware's entertaining.

775
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,500
We tell jokes, I do tricks with my fellow candlesticks.

776
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,820
And it's all in perfect taste that you can bet.

777
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,800
Come on and lift your glass, you won your own free pass.

778
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,320
To be our guest, if you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest.

779
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,060
Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest.

780
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,900
Life is so unnerving for a servant who's not serving.

781
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,500
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon.

782
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,340
Ah, those good old days when we were useful.

783
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,820
Suddenly those good old days are gone.

784
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,540
Ten years we've been rusting, needing so much more than dusting.

785
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,920
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills.

786
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,180
Most days we just lie around ze castle.

787
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,980
Flabby, fat and lazy, you walked in and oops-a-daisy.

788
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,520
It's a guest, it's a guest, six alive, all be blessed.

789
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,360
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord I've had the napkins freshly pressed.

790
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,220
With dessert, chill one tea, and my dear that's fine with me.

791
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,120
While the cups do their soft shoo-in, I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing.

792
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,860
I'll get warm, piping hot, heaven's sakes is that a sport?

793
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,760
Clean it up, we want the company impressed.

794
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,400
We've got a lot to do, is it one lump or two?

795
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,540
For you our guest, she's our guest.

796
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,340
Guest, be our guest, our command is your request.

797
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,100
It's been years since we've had anybody here, and we're obsessed!

798
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,940
With your meal, with your ease, yes indeed we aim to please.

799
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:43,080
While the candlelight's still glowing, let us help you, we'll keep going.

800
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,360
By course, one by one.

801
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,760
Until you shout, enough, I'm done.

802
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,720
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest.

803
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:02,120
Tonight we'll pop your feet, but now let's eat to be our guest.

804
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,000
Be our guest.

805
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,360
Please be...

806
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,420
I can't go so high.

807
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,120
Guest!

808
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,480
Maybe I'm not warmed up as I thought.

809
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:27,470
I should have warmed up before stream.

810
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,650
Wait, hold on.

811
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,810
Let me do a different song.

812
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,430
This one.

813
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,870
This one's awesome on the ride.

814
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,150
I love this ride.

815
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,650
Wait, do I have to be the beast?

816
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,970
I think I have to be the beast.

817
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,610
I can be the beast.

818
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,270
There's something sweet and almost kind.

819
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,330
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined.

820
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,630
And now he's dear and so unsure.

821
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:18,550
I wonder why I didn't see it there before.

822
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,990
I'm going beast mode!

823
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,110
Beast mode!

824
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,040
Okay, okay.

825
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,780
She glanced this way.

826
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,960
I thought I saw her.

827
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,540
She didn't shudder at my paw.

828
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,960
But then she's never looked at me that way before.

829
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:55,220
A new and a bit alarming.

830
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,920
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?

831
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,240
I can't look at Jack.

832
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,620
You guys are making me laugh.

833
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,240
True, that he's no Prince Charming.

834
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,200
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see.

835
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,540
Well, who'd have thought?

836
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,540
Well, bless my soul.

837
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,340
Well, who indeed?

838
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,440
Who had known?

839
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,320
Guess it comes together on their own.

840
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,200
It's so peculiar.

841
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,220
We'll wait and see.

842
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,200
A few days more.

843
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,000
There may be something there that wasn't there before.

844
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,700
You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before.

845
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,860
What is it?

846
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,560
There may be something there that wasn't there before.

847
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,640
I'll tell you when you owe the chip.

848
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:53,840
Sorry.

849
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,820
This is like the most scuffed karaoke ever you guys.

850
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,360
I'm so sorry.

851
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm so sorry.

852
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,440
I can't take anything seriously.

853
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,680
But actually, this reminded me too.

854
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,460
I see this on here.

855
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Is that I was walking around the park in the Beauty and the Beast area.

856
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,260
And they had an instrumental of this version.

857
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,620
Or of this song.

858
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,180
Which is only from the movie, but it's like probably my favorite.

859
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,440
I think it became like one of my favorite...

860
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,080
Beauty and the Beast songs.

861
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,920
It's only from the live action movie.

862
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,840
And they had an instrumental playing in the park and I was so like...

863
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,260
I can't believe they're acknowledging this song.

864
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:46,900
So...

865
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,600
So I sing this one.

866
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,800
I don't think I need to change the pitch.

867
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,040
But because of this, because I heard it in the park, I was like OK.

868
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,860
I want to do a watch along of this movie now.

869
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,680
Maybe we'll do it later this week.

870
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,020
Yeah, the Emma Watson one.

871
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,270
But she's still there.

872
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:52,210
I let her steal into my melancholy heart.

873
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,930
It's more than I can bear.

874
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:03,650
Now I know she'll never leave me.

875
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,310
Even as she runs away.

876
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:13,410
She will still torment me, call me, hurt me.

877
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:17,670
Move me, come what may.

878
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,370
Wasting in my lonely tower.

879
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,210
Waiting by an open door.

880
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,130
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in.

881
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,570
And be with me forevermore.

882
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,910
I rage against the trials of love.

883
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,370
I curse the fading of the light.

884
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:53,060
Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach.

885
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,510
She's never out of sight.

886
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:04,490
Now I know she'll never leave me.

887
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:08,550
Even as she fades from view.

888
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:17,410
She will still inspire me, be a part of everything I do.

889
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,790
Wasting in my lonely tower.

890
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,770
Waiting by an open door.

891
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,370
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in.

892
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,610
And as the long, long nights begin.

893
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,590
I'll think of all that might have been.

894
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:47,950
Waiting here forevermore.

895
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:53,650
Forevermore.

896
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,860
Oh, I forgot about Celis.

897
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,580
I'm so sorry.

898
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,120
My voice is not very good today.

899
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:15,240
I think the dryness from the plane has killed me even more than I already am.

900
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,030
What did I say?

901
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:24,510
Let's not think about Mufasa.

902
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,190
I sang...

903
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,270
Be our guest.

904
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:30,690
23.

905
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,310
Oh, be prepared.

906
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:37,990
That was a warm up.

907
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:39,930
Warm up.

908
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:42,690
Warm up.

909
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,850
Be prepared.

910
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,030
And then I did something there.

911
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,470
This is not a Disney karaoke.

912
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,190
Sorry, I just have Disney on the brain right now.

913
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,830
I'm maybe a certified Disney adult.

914
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,510
I don't know.

915
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:00,810
Do you mind if I open the window?

916
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,350
Stop!

917
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,370
Kiss the girl.

918
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,650
Disney adult.

919
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:11,970
That was Evermore.

920
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:13,750
From the movie.

921
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,170
I'm going to stop thinking about you saying I go men oof Chan with your Beast voice.

922
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,030
I go men oof Chan.

923
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,600
Oh, there's my oomph right there.

924
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,620
That's oomph.

925
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,420
That's oomph right there.

926
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,720
Apparently the Beast's real name is Prince Adam.

927
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,800
Saw it on a toy once.

928
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,140
No, his name is the Beast.

929
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,200
Not to be confused with another Beast.

930
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,580
Mr. Notoriety.

931
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:04,430
The last name Beast.

932
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,530
Even after he turns human.

933
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,470
Nobody wants him to turn human though.

934
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,870
Nobody wants him to actually turn human.

935
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,810
Everybody says go back Beast, go back!

936
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,830
Wait, the actor?

937
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,450
What actor is in Severance?

938
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:29,870
I think Belle still called him Beast after he turned back.

939
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:30,790
I sure hope so.

940
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,260
Yeah.

941
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,920
Belle asked him to grow a beard?

942
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,460
She was totally into it.

943
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,580
She was totally into it.

944
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,900
I just call him Mr. He's like, don't call me Mr. Beast.

945
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,920
That's my dad.

946
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,000
That's my father.

947
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,860
Thank you guys for all the... Ally, thank you so much for membership and thank you for the five gifted.

948
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Thank you guys.

949
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,620
Hayden, thank you so much for the five gifted.

950
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,480
Nerdy Laundry, thank you for the five gifted.

951
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,900
Sorry, I'm so bad at reading everything today and saying thank you today.

952
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:16,760
My brain is literally moving at one megapit... pit?

953
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,760
Not my pits.

954
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,200
Megapits.

955
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:21,980
Megabit.

956
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,540
One bit.

957
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,900
A single...

958
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,940
It's moving very slowly.

959
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,100
Invisible Booze, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

960
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,900
Disney songs are reminding me of Doki and Mint's adventures in Minecraft.

961
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,020
Oh, it was so fun.

962
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,200
Tony, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

963
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,260
Thank you guys so much.

964
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,700
Thank you!

965
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,200
Megapits.

966
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,760
It's like, what was that?

967
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,840
The Megamilk shirt?

968
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,520
Does anybody still remember that?

969
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,080
Does anyone still care about the Megamilk shirt?

970
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,920
Is that a dead meme now?

971
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,820
Probably.

972
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,700
I do.

973
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,780
I remember.

974
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,300
I remember.

975
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,520
Oh my gosh, my throat is so bad today.

976
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,340
Someone asked for Hercules earlier.

977
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,680
Hercules.

978
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,740
Hercules.

979
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,380
I don't remember so many Hercules.

980
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,860
This isn't...

981
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,520
This isn't a... Sorry, people are messaging me.

982
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,000
This isn't a Disney karaoke.

983
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,860
Would say I'm in love.

984
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,480
Okay.

985
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,440
Have no... anything for today.

986
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,720
Oh, whoops, sorry.

987
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,340
I didn't realize it started.

988
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
Okay, one more redo!

989
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:19,440
If there's a prize for rotten judgment, I guess I've already won that.

990
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,140
No man is worth the aggravation.

991
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,240
That's ancient history, been there, done that.

992
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,820
Who'd you think you're kidding?

993
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,280
He's the earth and heaven to you.

994
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,760
Try to keep it hidden.

995
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,840
Oh no!

996
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,680
No chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no.

997
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,660
It's too cliché, I won't say I'm in love.

998
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,020
I thought my heart had learned its lesson.

999
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,540
It feels so good when you start out.

1000
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,400
My head is screaming, get a grip, ghost!

1001
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,640
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out.

1002
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,480
Oh no!

1003
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh,

1004
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:36,030
no chance, no way, I won't say it, no, no.

1005
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:39,770
Give in, check the grid, you're in love.

1006
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,130
This scene won't play, I won't say I'm in love.

1007
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,210
I think I got that note wrong.

1008
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:55,200
I won't say it, get off my case, I won't say it.

1009
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,940
Girl, don't be proud, it's OK, you're in love.

1010
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:12,160
At least I'm loud, I won't say I'm in love.

1011
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:24,530
It can't make me!

1012
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,490
It can't make me say it.

1013
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,750
Oh, where did the setlist go?

1014
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,950
Sorry, I'm so messed up today.

1015
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,290
I'm so messed up today.

1016
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,510
I won't say I'm in love.

1017
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,290
What did I just move?

1018
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:44,190
Just kidding.

1019
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,610
Oh my gosh, I'm so messed up today.

1020
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,010
Today?

1021
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:56,390
Yes, today.

1022
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,490
Usually, I'm OK, usually.

1023
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,670
Ohayo!

1024
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:02,730
Ohayo, ohayo.

1025
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,030
Yeah, Meg is so tsundere.

1026
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,390
Thank you for tsundere love song.

1027
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,010
You're welcome.

1028
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,610
Yeah, you're welcome.

1029
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,590
There was...oh, what else do I want to sing?

1030
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,930
Oh, I remember.

1031
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,450
Oh, the reason I have my glasses on.

1032
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:25,490
Hold on.

1033
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,990
The reason I have my glasses...oh.

1034
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:39,290
Wait, hold on.

1035
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,510
Hold on.

1036
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,490
I wanted to sing a cool...I wanted to sing this because...

1037
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:54,450
I heard it the other day and I was just like...

1038
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,490
I was like...

1039
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:01,630
Hey, this should be when I leave, OK?

1040
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,990
This is how I feel.

1041
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,590
Inside and out and love's strange.

1042
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,630
So real in the dark.

1043
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:49,530
So lovely come the tender things that we were working on.

1044
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,230
Slow change may pull us apart.

1045
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:57,850
When the light gets into your heart, baby.

1046
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:02,610
Don't you forget about me.

1047
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:11,380
Don't, don't, don't you forget about me.

1048
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:19,030
Can you stand above me?

1049
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:30,290
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down and down.

1050
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,590
Reminds me, call my name or walk on by.

1051
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,140
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling.

1052
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,300
It's my feeling going in the end.

1053
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:22,810
I want defenses, vanity and security.

1054
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:28,190
Oh, don't you forget about me.

1055
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,510
I'll be alone dancing.

1056
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,190
You know it, baby.

1057
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:34,670
Going

1058
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,180
back together at heart.

1059
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,350
Forget about me.

1060
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,060
My name.

1061
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:25,450
Or will you walk away?

1062
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,180
If you see me on the streets, go Mickey!

1063
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,040
Will you walk on by?

1064
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,220
Come on, call my name, will you?

1065
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:46,930
Mickey!

1066
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:53,190
I say la, la, la, la, la.

1067
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:28,930
Yeah, OK.

1068
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,810
Now you guys won't forget about me, OK?

1069
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:35,470
Don't you forget about me.

1070
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:38,450
This song is way deeper than I thought it would be.

1071
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,870
La, la, la, who?

1072
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,110
Don't say who!

1073
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,860
Don't say who!

1074
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:57,550
Don't say who!

1075
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:58,450
It's Mickey!

1076
01:03:59,050 --> 01:03:59,630
It's Mito!

1077
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:00,590
It's me!

1078
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,650
Don't say the who, that's a band!

1079
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,130
No!

1080
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:12,790
No, don't say hey, it's for horses!

1081
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:14,770
No!

1082
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,680
OK, I'm over it.

1083
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,960
Sorry, I got really big all of a sudden.

1084
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,500
Thank you so much for the 50 gift cards!

1085
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1086
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,060
Jump scare.

1087
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,680
I wonder if they have...oh, sorry.

1088
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:40,680
Oh my gosh.

1089
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,020
I was so stressed about the collab cafe, you guys.

1090
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,400
I can't tell you how much I was like...

1091
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,060
Oh gosh, will anybody go to it?

1092
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,900
Because...OK, let me explain my reasoning.

1093
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,840
Because people are like...

1094
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,060
Mint is going to say...

1095
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,440
I saw, I saw, I saw.

1096
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:09,300
People being like, Mint is going to be like, I can't believe so many people went to the maid cafe.

1097
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,000
Underestimating, blah, blah, blah, whatever, whatever.

1098
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,820
But, but...

1099
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:21,460
I thought that, you know, OK, hear me out.

1100
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,240
People, people, you know...

1101
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:31,380
It's Japan and I don't have so many fans in Japan.

1102
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,860
And also, also, I...

1103
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:42,180
I was like thinking, oh, you know, some people might not go because they have other plans.

1104
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:50,320
Like, you know, yeah, fest, like holo fest or, or, or, or...

1105
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,640
Expo or whatever.

1106
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:58,620
And, well, I mean, I did pick around that time because I figured more people would be in Japan.

1107
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,960
But I also was just like, oh, you know, hololive fans are probably not a fan of maid-o-minto.

1108
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:08,820
So, um...

1109
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,780
So, I...

1110
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,320
Was like, I, I, and I was so stressed out.

1111
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,880
I actually, like the first couple of days, I got this like...

1112
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,780
Hopefully you can't see it.

1113
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:29,780
I got this horrible like rash, like stress rash on my, on my neck.

1114
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:36,940
Luckily it was so cold I just always wore, I just always wore, uh, uh, turtlenecks.

1115
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,440
But...

1116
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,940
But I was like...

1117
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,340
I was like, oh my god, it hurts so bad.

1118
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,900
It's so bad.

1119
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:55,160
I was like, only, I just touched my neck and I was like, oh, I still feel it.

1120
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,420
It's like, it's getting a bit better.

1121
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,140
But I was, I was truly stressing, okay?

1122
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,780
I was really stressing out about it.

1123
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,260
Okay, so...

1124
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,180
Yeah.

1125
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,600
What do you mean hickey?

1126
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,540
No, no, it was not.

1127
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,980
What are you talking about?

1128
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,300
Stop, stop making fun of my pain.

1129
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,890
Fun of my pain.

1130
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,100
The pain, the pain.

1131
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,440
It was like, it was like across my entire neck.

1132
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:55,160
Like, it was my entire, actually it was my entire neck.

1133
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,840
Like someone had choked me out.

1134
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:02,460
But it was like itchy and hurt.

1135
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,240
And I was like, this is so embarrassing, I can't go outside.

1136
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,020
I can only wear turtlenecks.

1137
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,430
So...

1138
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:21,650
So, I, you know, for anybody who was just like...

1139
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:25,630
Why didn't she think anybody would go?

1140
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,730
I honestly had no idea.

1141
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,650
Okay, okay.

1142
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,650
Gosh, like a phantom pain.

1143
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:38,910
You guys, I don't think you know what hickeys are.

1144
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:43,010
I don't think you guys know what that is.

1145
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:44,510
Isn't it basically a bruise?

1146
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:45,970
A hickey.

1147
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,050
Isn't it?

1148
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:53,940
Yes.

1149
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,300
Yeah, we do.

1150
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,700
Then why if I say I got a rash, you think it's a hickey?

1151
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,150
Why do you think that?

1152
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:16,410
Because it's on your neck.

1153
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:20,770
Okay, I understand.

1154
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:25,170
Sometimes if I'm with Mitara and she meets someone...

1155
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:28,230
She'll be like, I see that hickey on your neck.

1156
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,250
Not talking to me, talking to the other person.

1157
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:33,070
And I'm like...

1158
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:37,030
First of all, if it is a hickey, why are you pointing it out?

1159
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:40,110
But second of all, why would you just say that to somebody?

1160
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,610
Why would you just call them out like that?

1161
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,510
Why would you say that?

1162
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,770
Because she is Mitara.

1163
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:54,870
Classic Mitara.

1164
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:55,630
True.

1165
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,930
That reflects the streamer.

1166
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:59,610
Can you teach me what a hickey is?

1167
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:00,830
I'm a hands-on learner.

1168
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:01,950
Shut up.

1169
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:07,790
Shut up.

1170
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,110
My thoughts are built different.

1171
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,970
I truly...

1172
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:12,430
Extroverts are so scary.

1173
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:14,550
Extroverts are so scary.

1174
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:15,370
They say anything.

1175
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,030
And she'll just be like...

1176
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:22,030
Go to the person and be like, I see that hickey on your neck.

1177
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,170
Mitara, decorum, please.

1178
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:33,350
And I don't even notice it either.

1179
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:37,310
I'm like, how would you know that it's a hickey and not just like...

1180
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,510
I don't know, something else.

1181
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,410
How would you even know?

1182
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:45,130
I think that's just Mitara.

1183
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,170
Potentially.

1184
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,710
Wait, is this live?

1185
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,890
Yeah, I'm live.

1186
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,130
Actually no, I'm dead.

1187
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,770
I'm not live at all.

1188
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,910
I've been dead my whole afterlife.

1189
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:08,050
I've been dead my whole afterlife you guys.

1190
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,490
Hold on.

1191
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,470
I was gonna...

1192
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,330
There is another song I wanted to sing, but I need to...

1193
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,610
I need to up the pitch.

1194
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,250
Up to see if I have it.

1195
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:27,510
Let's see, maybe here.

1196
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:33,830
Grandma.

1197
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:35,530
No.

1198
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,550
Oh no, do they not have a pitch version?

1199
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:41,310
Hold on, let me...

1200
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:43,050
Let me see.

1201
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,250
Basically...

1202
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:50,250
Oh my gosh you guys, I was in Akihabara when it snowed both times.

1203
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:54,490
I was in Akihabara when it snowed both times and I was like...

1204
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:59,150
But the second time I was in Akihabara, it was...

1205
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,330
It was...

1206
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:02,470
It was...

1207
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,050
It was...

1208
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:05,970
It was...

1209
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:06,370
Sorry.

1210
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,850
I'm so slow today.

1211
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:12,730
Not it was, I was...

1212
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:19,650
I was at a maid cafe.

1213
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:23,090
And I could see the snow from the window.

1214
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,370
And I was like...

1215
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:30,850
And the maids were like, oh my gosh, should we...

1216
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,330
Should we sing Snow Halation?

1217
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:36,310
Anybody wanna sing Snow Halation?

1218
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:36,990
Let's go!

1219
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:42,870
Except, one guy that was at the cafe, he was just like, no, no Snow Halation.

1220
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,990
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna have you guys sing this song instead.

1221
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:49,350
And it's like, so depressing.

1222
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,350
I was like, why would you...

1223
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:56,550
Why would you ask them to sing this song instead?

1224
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,810
Because it's so depressing.

1225
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:01,910
It's literally from a drama called One Liter of Tears.

1226
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,790
And so, it's like, just a sad song.

1227
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,690
But I was like, oh my gosh, I haven't heard this song in so long, so I'm gonna sing it.

1228
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:12,910
I'm gonna sing it.

1229
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:17,830
Yeah, but we did not get... Maybe I should have requested Snow Halation.

1230
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,370
I'm gonna get rid of my glasses.

1231
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:22,690
This is not a freak phantom moment.

1232
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,430
Have you guys watched that movie though, One Liter of Tears?

1233
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,570
It was a movie that...

1234
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,030
Was it a movie or a series?

1235
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,050
Actually, now I can't remember, but I really liked it.

1236
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:43,130
It's about this girl who has this rare degenerative brain disorder.

1237
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:48,250
When I first watched it, I was like, oh my gosh, I wanna become a nurse.

1238
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,770
And then, I failed chemistry.

1239
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:51,730
No, I didn't fail.

1240
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,590
I barely passed chemistry.

1241
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:56,630
And I also was like, I'm afraid of needle.

1242
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,630
So I said...

1243
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,610
I don't think I should become a nurse.

1244
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:05,070
But the sentiment is still there.

1245
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,830
Anyway, I'm gonna sing this song.

1246
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:12,090
It's called Konayuki by Remi Yoroman.

1247
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:15,690
And actually, they have another song called Sangatsu Kokonoka.

1248
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:21,150
Which I was like, oh my gosh, I can sing that song because I'll be streaming on Sangatsu Kokonoka.

1249
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:22,330
And then I was like, no, I'm not.

1250
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:23,530
It's...

1251
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:26,990
I'll sing it anyway.

1252
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:29,330
I was like...

1253
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:33,530
That's the 9th.

1254
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:35,270
It's not even close.

1255
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,510
It is close enough though, right?

1256
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:39,650
It is Sangatsu, yeah.

1257
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:41,750
It's not March 9th at all.

1258
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,090
But it's close enough, maybe.

1259
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:45,170
Okay, hold on, let me take a sippy.

1260
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,980
I found this pitched up version, but...

1261
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,720
I don't know how it is.

1262
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:02,080
Maybe it's okay.

1263
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,480
Oh, wait.

1264
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:14,840
That's the pitch.

1265
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,740
I

1266
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,760
read the kanji.

1267
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,380
Okay, I think that's it.

1268
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,320
Okay, sorry, redo.

1269
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,960
Konayuki lyrics.

1270
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,920
I can't read the...

1271
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,120
There's no furigana, why?

1272
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,020
I can't read.

1273
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,400
There's no furigana.

1274
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,800
One more time!

1275
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,020
Kanji is hard.

1276
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,200
It's hard, right?

1277
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,740
I don't think the pitch is right.

1278
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:35,310
Maybe I should just check the original, but it's really low.

1279
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:46,810
I don't know.

1280
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:54,230
I don't know.

1281
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:55,950
This

1282
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:02,270
is so...

1283
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:03,670
Harsh.

1284
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:05,970
You know?

1285
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,330
I can't read the kanji.

1286
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:45,350
I

1287
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:08,390
can't read.

1288
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:41,930
I can't read.

1289
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:58,670
Cursed.

1290
01:20:59,050 --> 01:20:59,770
So cursed.

1291
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,990
So cursed.

1292
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,010
Why would they put it plus 5?

1293
01:21:06,670 --> 01:21:09,090
Why would they put it plus 5 instead of like...

1294
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,410
I always do like plus 2.

1295
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:12,830
It's too high!

1296
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,830
Wait, I just saw a plus 3 version.

1297
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:17,110
Oh my god.

1298
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,890
Wait, let me hear what this one sounds like.

1299
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,210
This one's probably...

1300
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,830
It already sounds better.

1301
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:41,090
Why plus 5?

1302
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:15,790
I give up.

1303
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,050
I give up.

1304
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:24,470
I give up!

1305
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:25,630
Let's do the next one.

1306
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,790
I think maybe this one I can do without a pitch.

1307
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,970
We'll see.

1308
01:22:58,610 --> 01:22:59,470
Hold on.

1309
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:02,930
Stop spamming!

1310
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:09,740
Everyone in the moon.

1311
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,660
Anyway, redo!

1312
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:17,150
I don't think this is from One Litre of Tears.

1313
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:20,530
Same album though, as the other song.

1314
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,410
So high!

1315
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,310
I give up.

1316
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,270
I give up.

1317
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:48,910
I don't remember that part.

1318
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:49,970
I don't remember that part.

1319
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:54,290
I give up.

1320
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,030
March 9th.

1321
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:56,510
How do I put this?

1322
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:57,770
Let me just write it in Japanese.

1323
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:03,250
There we go.

1324
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,270
Heaven's divide.

1325
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,310
I can try it.

1326
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:20,930
Heaven's divide.

1327
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:22,090
Heaven's divide.

1328
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,450
I should've really come in with a setlist.

1329
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:25,710
You guys, I'm so sorry.

1330
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:30,210
I was like, I can chill, I can sing, I can yap about my trip.

1331
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:32,250
Whatever, whatever.

1332
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:34,330
All good.

1333
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:35,910
No stress.

1334
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:41,370
So sorry if it's a little...

1335
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:42,190
You know?

1336
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,290
It's a little all over.

1337
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:49,450
Oh my gosh, if I search Heaven's Divide karaoke, I see...

1338
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,970
I see a clip channel with my...

1339
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:53,310
Oh my gosh, I see myself.

1340
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:58,790
Thank you!

1341
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:01,990
Thank you, thank you.

1342
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:04,270
Thank you!

1343
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:06,210
I think it's this one.

1344
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,050
Thank you!

1345
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,890
I have something for you guys later.

1346
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:15,710
I do.

1347
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:19,190
I have something for you later.

1348
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:25,970
Of course, when the stars align.

1349
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:29,870
I will reach out to you.

1350
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:33,330
And leave this all behind.

1351
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:38,950
With Heaven's Divide.

1352
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:41,350
I think I'll start Peace Walker this week.

1353
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:44,890
We can all play.

1354
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:49,950
I want to play Peace Walker so bad.

1355
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:57,360
Which console I haven't decided yet.

1356
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,720
Probably Xbox.

1357
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,740
Since I did PlayStation last time.

1358
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:11,100
When Heaven's Divide, I will see the choices within my hands.

1359
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:18,540
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

1360
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:25,880
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

1361
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:33,580
Do you feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

1362
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:40,860
When Heaven's Divide, time will come to softly lay me down.

1363
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:48,760
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

1364
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:55,380
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

1365
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:03,460
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

1366
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,940
When Heaven's Divide.

1367
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:07,140
When Heaven's Divide.

1368
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:13,920
Also yes, I did see the Death Stranding 2 trailer.

1369
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:20,740
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1370
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:30,060
I will dive into the fire, spilling the blood of my desire.

1371
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:39,560
The very last time my name scorched into the sky.

1372
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:48,580
When Heaven's Divide, I will see the choices within my hands.

1373
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:56,380
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

1374
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:03,460
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fears.

1375
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:11,080
Do you feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

1376
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:18,720
When Heaven's Divide, time will come to softly lay me down.

1377
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:25,580
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

1378
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:33,100
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

1379
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:41,000
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

1380
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,880
When Heaven's Divide.

1381
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:08,110
Leaving a trace for love.

1382
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,900
When Heaven's Divide.

1383
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:25,920
Yay!

1384
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,640
Heaven's Divide.

1385
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,200
Nice.

1386
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:35,600
Metal Gear.

1387
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,080
Nice.

1388
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,380
Metal Gear.

1389
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:39,260
Nice.

1390
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,560
Yay, yay, yay.

1391
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,880
Thanks Donnerburg.

1392
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,240
Metal Gear.

1393
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:51,900
Nice.

1394
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,780
Metal Gear.

1395
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,760
Nice.

1396
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,500
Nice, Metal Gear.

1397
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,000
Nice.

1398
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,560
What's another spring song?

1399
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,640
What's another springy song?

1400
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,120
Spring spring time.

1401
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,100
Springy spring can be English or Japanese.

1402
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,180
Japanese.

1403
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,360
Tsuyoi kimochi tsuyoi ai.

1404
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,810
Do I even have that on here?

1405
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:36,130
I think I would have to load up my...what's it called?

1406
01:35:38,230 --> 01:35:38,750
Tsuyoi.

1407
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:40,930
That's a Denpo Gumi song.

1408
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:41,990
Kimochi.

1409
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:46,090
I think you're talking about the Denpo Gumi song, no?

1410
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:49,990
Tsuyoi ai.

1411
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,620
What is it?

1412
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,640
Wait, is it a cover?

1413
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:56,840
Actually, I have no idea.

1414
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:58,140
Wait, hold on.

1415
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,280
I only know the Denpo version.

1416
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,440
Tsuyoi kimochi tsuyoi ai.

1417
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:13,450
I never knew it was a cover!

1418
01:36:13,710 --> 01:36:14,350
I'm an idiot.

1419
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:20,480
I think I can sing this version.

1420
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:21,780
Probably.

1421
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,960
Because I know the Denpo Gumi version.

1422
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:24,860
Let's do it.

1423
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,660
Let's try it.

1424
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,340
Today is whatever whatever.

1425
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,960
Today is whatever whatever.

1426
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,600
Who wants to dance?

1427
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,280
Stand up!

1428
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,400
Who wants to dance?

1429
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:02,680
It's a little off the pitch.

1430
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:46,940
Hara ato yuma no shiru hirou Afureru hikari koe midori Atarashii kamisamatachi ga Patto hanayagu Mahou o kakeru Machi wa fukaku bokura wo utau It's so low, though!

1431
01:37:46,940 --> 01:38:07,040
Tsuyoi kimochi tsuyoi ai Kokoro wo gyutto tsunagu Ikutsu no kanashimi mo Okorasu sasageau Ima kono kimochi Really?

1432
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,120
Right?

1433
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:08,260
Right?

1434
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:26,140
Shiru koneko no you ni Boku wa kiseki wo matteita yoru Okurasu

1435

1436
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:07,630
Kanashimi mo okorasu sasageau

1437
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,920
Oh my god, it's the overlapping part.

1438
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:33,280
Yorokobi no naka e Tsuyoi kimochi tsuyoi ai Nante!

1439
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,860
Dancing in the street, baby!

1440
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,980
Kanzashitai no wa dare?

1441
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:50,990
Dancing in the street, baby!

1442
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,180
Osukushita hora

1443
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:28,910
Utsukushii sora Hibikiau sora Daremo mita koto no nai hibi mo Ryukui

1444
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,680
kimochi Tsuyoi

1445
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:56,400
kanashimi mo Okorasu

1446
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:15,040
sasageau I'm so much more used to the Denpagumi version.

1447
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,350
But the original is also so funky.

1448
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:21,010
It's fun.

1449
01:42:23,310 --> 01:42:25,910
It's also a pitch higher for the Denpagumi one.

1450
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:33,630
Tsuyoi kimochi tsuyoi ai And then it gets faster.

1451
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,910
So it's really fun.

1452
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:37,350
I wonder if there's any Denpagumi.

1453
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:42,110
Denpagumi Denpagumi ink!

1454
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:57,810
Semai suteji kara Sekai wo mezase Tsutai yo Miri miri no denpa Doko made mo yukeru It doesn't seem like it.

1455
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:58,210
It's ok.

1456
01:42:58,910 --> 01:42:59,670
It's ok.

1457
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:00,950
I'll just cry about it.

1458
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:03,310
Yeah, I love the speed up.

1459
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:03,990
It's so fun.

1460
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:08,550
I definitely recommend the Denpagumi version of that song.

1461
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,750
Tsuyoi kimochi tsuyoi ai

1462
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,170
They're both different kinds.

1463
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:18,750
Yeah, they're both different...

1464
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:25,690
Vibes, right?

1465
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:28,510
Are you using Kiara-fun tonight?

1466
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:29,230
I am!

1467
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,690
Why?

1468
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:30,550
Is there Denpagumi on there?

1469
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:34,330
Nope.

1470
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,730
Wait, maybe with an N.

1471
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,610
Instead of an M.

1472
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:43,650
Did you even make it through?

1473
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:45,750
I could make it through WWD.

1474
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:46,550
What are you talking about?

1475
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:47,090
Wait, let me see.

1476
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:49,730
WWD instrumental.

1477
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:52,110
If they have it, I'll sing it.

1478
01:43:58,270 --> 01:43:58,990
Denpagumi WWD.

1479
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:00,510
Oh, do you mean by crying?

1480
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:02,210
Oh, without crying?

1481
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:04,490
Let's see.

1482
01:44:07,770 --> 01:44:12,330
For those who don't know, Denpagumi is my favorite idol group.

1483
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:15,630
In January, I went and saw them disband.

1484
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:20,330
And it was so beautiful and sad.

1485
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:27,350
But the song WWD is about basically how they met and how they were all bullied.

1486
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:32,790
And they were all like nerds who didn't really have a real direction in their life.

1487
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:35,030
And then they all met each other.

1488
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:43,810
They all joined Denpagumi and were like, we're gonna go from this small, small stage and we're gonna reach a worldwide audience.

1489
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:46,370
Everybody will know the name Denpagumi.

1490
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:48,670
And it's so beautiful.

1491
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:51,090
Thinking about it, I might cry already.

1492
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,030
Let's try singing it.

1493
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:57,950
Oh gosh, wait, there's other languages here.

1494
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:03,730
Hello, we are Denp- wait, oh, wait, hold on, wait, hold on.

1495
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:05,810
I was reading the translation.

1496
01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:06,490
That's so funny.

1497
01:45:06,750 --> 01:45:07,790
Hold on, one more time.

1498
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:10,570
Instead of the bonjour, nous sommes Denpagumi Inc.

1499
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:16,750
Bonjour, nous sommes Denpagumi Inc.

1500
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:19,150
Group of the idol of Japanese.

1501
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:21,570
I can't read and I'm being poor.

1502
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:24,210
Akihabara to all over the world.

1503
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:26,570
Season's Greeting.

1504
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:28,870
Let's go!

1505
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:45,070
I have a big dream.

1506
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:47,790
Even if I lose, it's fine, it's fine.

1507
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:48,470
What is it?

1508
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:49,110
Come on, come on.

1509
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:52,970
Denpagumi Inc.

1510
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:56,970
Now, it's a small, small, small, small stage.

1511
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:06,660
We can go as far as we want.

1512
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,960
There's nothing to throw away.

1513
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,800
It's a start from minus.

1514
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,080
Today, too, I'm going to go, go, go, go, go,

1515
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:20,710
go.

1516
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:22,610
We're going to win with our style.

1517
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:26,610
There's no place to live.

1518
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:33,830
Now, for the sake of my dream, I'm going to let it go.

1519
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:35,730
Denpagumi Inc.

1520
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:39,010
Let me tell you how to use Uryaoi.

1521
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:42,190
Please shout it twice after our singing.

1522
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:43,630
Five!

1523
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:52,730
Uryaoi!

1524
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:53,350
Uryaoi!

1525
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:54,330
Worldwide!

1526
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,880
Japanese is hard, too.

1527
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:00,240
Uryaoi!

1528
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:00,840
Uryaoi!

1529
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:01,840
Heart!

1530
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:03,440
Uryaoi!

1531
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:03,620
Uryaoi!

1532
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:05,420
Denpagumi Inc.

1533
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:08,840
Even if I lose, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1534
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:16,640
I feel like I've been born.

1535
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:20,940
I'm finally starting to understand myself.

1536
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:32,010
I don't go to school anymore.

1537
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:32,950
I only use the internet.

1538
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:35,170
I'm not lonely online.

1539
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:36,350
Me too.

1540
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:38,270
I don't go out of my room at all.

1541
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:39,110
I didn't want to go out of my room.

1542
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:41,250
I loved everything online.

1543
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:42,330
I had a girlfriend who was an internet celebrity.

1544
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:47,910
We were enemies.

1545
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:52,350
I've been a cosplayer since I was a kid.

1546
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:54,850
I admired the cute and sparkling world.

1547
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:57,030
I've always seen it.

1548
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:58,390
I was small and shiny.

1549
01:48:58,830 --> 01:48:59,950
And I couldn't do anything.

1550
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:02,550
Time has passed and I'm a high school student.

1551
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:04,050
Time has passed and I'm a maid.

1552
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:06,510
For some reason, the two of us are now...

1553
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,470
Oh, I was fast.

1554
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:08,850
We are together.

1555
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:14,830
I was in Akihabara after I killed my ex-wife.

1556
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:16,730
A maid cafe where I work.

1557
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:17,250
A girl.

1558
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:18,570
She was so cute.

1559
01:49:19,150 --> 01:49:19,590
She looked lonely.

1560
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:20,970
I was hurt.

1561
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:23,690
But she gave me meaning.

1562
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:25,610
I want to be a little more powerful.

1563
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:27,110
I thought so.

1564
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:28,770
But we broke up.

1565
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:30,990
Lily.

1566
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:31,710
Lisa.

1567
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:32,410
Nemu.

1568
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:32,910
Eri.

1569
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:33,550
Oga.

1570
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:34,230
Riki.

1571
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:36,410
The three of us are now...

1572
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:37,910
One.

1573
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:45,030
I've been through a lot.

1574
01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:46,330
I've been through a lot.

1575
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:48,750
I had a dream.

1576
01:49:49,650 --> 01:49:50,570
I do it every day.

1577
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:52,230
Our name is...

1578
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:52,950
Denpagumi.

1579
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:53,710
Let's go!

1580
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:57,890
From a small stage.

1581
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:00,670
Aim for the world.

1582
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:02,890
I want to tell you.

1583
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:13,370
And then start.

1584
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:14,670
What is it like?

1585
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:26,690
I can't read the words.

1586
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:56,270
That part is so hard.

1587
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:57,410
It's like...

1588
01:50:58,010 --> 01:50:59,010
Wait, wait, wait.

1589
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:03,870
It's just the days of the week.

1590
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:24,390
Oh my gosh.

1591
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:25,410
Do you guys know?

1592
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:28,670
Lactobacillus KCI.

1593
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:32,570
I love Yakult.

1594
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:40,010
I was telling my friends the other day about the Lactobacillus KCI.

1595
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:44,850
Wait, let me find it.

1596
01:51:45,630 --> 01:51:47,170
I think I still have it in my history.

1597
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:51,970
No, I don't have it.

1598
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:52,490
Wait.

1599
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:01,350
Lactobacillus KCI.

1600
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:05,710
Lactobacillus...

1601
01:52:06,410 --> 01:52:07,490
Yakult.

1602
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:07,990
Hold on.

1603
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,300
Lactobacillus KCI.

1604
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:17,160
Lactobacillus...

1605
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:17,520
No.

1606
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:18,680
Lactobacillus...

1607
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:18,940
No.

1608
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:21,180
Lactobacillus KCI.

1609
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:28,180
Yakult.

1610
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:28,880
Yeah.

1611
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:30,380
Yakult.

1612
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,720
I can't say it without reading it.

1613
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:41,780
I can't say it without reading it.

1614
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,320
I love Prairie Puppets.

1615
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,620
Lactobacillus KCI bacillus.

1616
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:58,740
No.

1617
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:00,060
Lactobacillus KCI.

1618
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,080
I keep adding a bacillus.

1619
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,400
Like it's a dinosaur.

1620
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,480
Lactobacillus.

1621
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,160
No, it's not Lactobacillus.

1622
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,700
It's Lactobacillus KCI bacillus.

1623
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,920
Lactobacillus KCI bacillus.

1624
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,980
Lactobacillus KCI bacillus.

1625
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,440
Lactosaurus.

1626
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,340
Happy birthday!

1627
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,300
How do I say your name?

1628
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,160
Next joke.

1629
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:42,140
It's not a joke.

1630
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:42,760
It's real.

1631
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,000
It's not a joke.

1632
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:48,780
Is my existence a joke to you?

1633
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,640
Not that I'm the lactobacillus.

1634
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,660
Let's go back to an English song.

1635
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:55,440
Let's go back to English.

1636
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,200
Oh wait, I did WWD.

1637
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,120
Kind of.

1638
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:01,180
Actually, that one was kind of painful to do.

1639
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:01,820
Not going to lie.

1640
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:04,280
My throat is not so great today.

1641
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,200
I think I will take a break.

1642
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,680
I have to record a bunch of stuff.

1643
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,440
So I'm going to have to...

1644
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,680
I'm going to have to preserve my voice for a while.

1645
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:21,680
What's an English song?

1646
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:23,980
What's a spring song?

1647
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:25,900
Spring song.

1648
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:29,160
Spring.

1649
01:54:29,860 --> 01:54:31,300
It's spring time.

1650
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:36,720
What are you recording?

1651
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:39,940
That's for me to know and for you to never find out.

1652
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:47,100
No, I'm not singing Snow Halation because someone annoyed me earlier about it.

1653
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:51,980
Someone was spamming in chat earlier about Snow Halation.

1654
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:52,880
I said, no.

1655
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,660
I won't sing it now.

1656
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,220
It is.

1657
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:04,280
I just said I wanted to go back to English songs.

1658
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:05,860
But actually, this might be on here.

1659
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:10,840
It is.

1660
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,780
I'll have some guy sing the voice.

1661
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,620
The name.

1662
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:47,060
Scared me.

1663
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,280
Sorry, hold on.

1664
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,800
What's the harmony there?

1665
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:30,200
Sorry.

1666
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:35,300
Sorry for the break.

1667
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,540
Wait, what was it?

1668
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,000
Wait, I don't remember.

1669
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:52,300
Okay, I'll try it.

1670
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:53,040
Redo!

1671
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:42,030
Sorry.

1672
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:03,390
Sorry.

1673
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,990
Sorry.

1674
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:15,030
Sorry.

1675
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:41,960
Sorry.

1676
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:09,540
Sorry.

1677
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:08,620
Sorry, I ran out of breath at the last bit.

1678
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:12,280
Victor-san, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1679
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:13,500
Thank you!

1680
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:20,580
This song is confusing because it doesn't tell you when it's the girl part and when it's the boy part.

1681
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:23,380
It doesn't tell you.

1682
02:01:26,430 --> 02:01:28,170
This song is so good though, right?

1683
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:30,970
There's another song.

1684
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,190
It's not...

1685
02:01:32,190 --> 02:01:33,630
Okay, well this is...

1686
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:38,630
This is...

1687
02:01:40,830 --> 02:01:43,050
We're going through the seasons now at this point.

1688
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:50,450
We'll do this one.

1689
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:02,650
That didn't count me in!

1690
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:02,950
Okay.

1691
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:23,670
Itsumo dori no aru hi no koto Kimi wa totsuzen tachiagari ita Kon'ya hoshi wo mi ni yukou

1692
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:57,320
Nante mina shite itte waratta Akari mo nai michi wo Baka mitai ni hashaide aruita Kakaekonda kodoku ya fuan ni

1693
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:26,200
Oshitsubusarenai you ni Bakugan na sekai kara miageta Yozora wa hoshi ga furu you de When did I start chasing you?

1694
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:34,600
Please don't be surprised.

1695
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:46,660
Listen to my feelings.

1696
02:03:52,570 --> 02:03:55,290
Areca de neve, areca il vega.

1697
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:58,150
You are a summer triangle pointing at me.

1698
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:02,470
I remember and look at the sky.

1699
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:06,390
I finally found you, Orihime.

1700
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:09,830
But where are you, Hikoboshi-sama?

1701
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:15,410
Now I'm all alone.

1702
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:21,910
You are next to me, a fun person.

1703
02:04:26,050 --> 02:04:30,190
I can't say anything.

1704
02:04:30,190 --> 02:04:37,950
Actually, I've known you for a long time.

1705
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:48,530
Even if I find you, I can't reach you.

1706
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:53,590
No, don't cry.

1707
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:59,510
That's what I said.

1708
02:05:05,170 --> 02:05:07,890
I'm a strong coward.

1709
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:10,750
I pretended not to be interested.

1710
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:17,170
But...

1711
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:19,690
The pain in my chest is getting worse.

1712
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:21,150
Ah, I see.

1713
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:22,310
So this is what it feels like to fall in love.

1714
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:35,490
There's a mix here and I never remember it.

1715
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:36,310
Every time.

1716
02:05:36,710 --> 02:05:37,670
I'll learn it one day.

1717
02:05:41,190 --> 02:05:43,470
It's a song for... a remix for this song.

1718
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:52,380
Together?

1719
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:53,080
Okay!

1720
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:54,620
Yeah, we should.

1721
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:01,220
Go down to the stars.

1722
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:08,550
I hear your voice.

1723
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:20,130
The truth is cruel.

1724
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:24,690
I didn't say it.

1725
02:06:25,730 --> 02:06:27,610
I couldn't say it.

1726
02:06:28,610 --> 02:06:33,450
I can't go back.

1727
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:36,510
That summer day.

1728
02:06:37,270 --> 02:06:39,310
Sparkling stars.

1729
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:45,910
I can still remember it now.

1730
02:06:46,270 --> 02:06:47,830
A smiling face.

1731
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:50,690
An angry face.

1732
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:53,310
I loved you.

1733
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:57,490
It's strange, isn't it?

1734
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:58,850
I knew it.

1735
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:02,770
You don't know.

1736
02:07:03,530 --> 02:07:07,050
My secret.

1737
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:10,610
Beyond the night.

1738
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:13,870
A distant memory.

1739
02:07:13,870 --> 02:07:20,810
You pointed at me.

1740
02:07:23,550 --> 02:07:25,790
With an innocent voice.

1741
02:07:32,210 --> 02:07:33,310
I found it though.

1742
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:34,030
I found the mix.

1743
02:07:37,460 --> 02:07:38,460
She looks eepy.

1744
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:41,360
I was looking down on my phone trying to find it.

1745
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:43,700
Hold on, I can find it.

1746
02:07:43,700 --> 02:07:47,460
A story you don't know.

1747
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:51,420
If you heard that, that was my tummy.

1748
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:51,800
Sorry.

1749
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,520
Hold on, I found it.

1750
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,360
I found it.

1751
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:02,620
To the star of hope.

1752
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,840
What kanji is that?

1753
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:08,120
I don't know.

1754
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:09,840
I copy and paste.

1755
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:11,480
Copy and paste.

1756
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:13,420
To the star of hope.

1757
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:16,800
It's a good kojou, I think.

1758
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,780
You are wrong.

1759
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:23,960
You are strong.

1760
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,340
And then you say that Oshii name.

1761
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:27,980
You are strong.

1762
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:28,820
Really.

1763
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:34,240
I fell in love with you.

1764
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:37,340
I will never let go of your hand.

1765
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:40,380
I want to wish for this moment.

1766
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:44,760
I have been looking at you.

1767
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:47,280
I can't say it with courage.

1768
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,620
But in my heart...

1769
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:50,320
What is that?

1770
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:50,620
Oku?

1771
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:55,560
But in my heart...

1772
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:58,580
This feeling that pierces me.

1773
02:08:59,420 --> 02:09:00,160
After all...

1774
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,040
Did you say mint?

1775
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:03,220
I love mint.

1776
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:04,300
I love mint.

1777
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:06,060
I love it.

1778
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,400
That's the mix.

1779
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:11,320
To the star of hope.

1780
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:14,100
I fell in love with you.

1781
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:19,860
I will never let go of your hand.

1782
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:22,160
I want to wish for this moment.

1783
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,740
I have been looking at you.

1784
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:27,980
I can't say it with courage.

1785
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:30,140
It's basically saying like...

1786
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:34,800
I will muster the courage.

1787
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:36,820
Or maybe not.

1788
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:39,480
I love you.

1789
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:44,880
Let's try it.

1790
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:45,580
Let's see if we can do it.

1791
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:45,940
Hold on.

1792
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,060
Let's see if we can do it.

1793
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:51,040
Even if I find you.

1794
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:55,020
I can't reach you.

1795
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:56,800
It's a dream.

1796
02:09:57,880 --> 02:09:59,780
Don't cry.

1797
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:05,720
That's what I said.

1798
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:07,540
Wait.

1799
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:08,260
It's after this part.

1800
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:16,980
To the star of hope.

1801
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,840
I fell in love with you.

1802
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:23,740
I will never let go of your hand.

1803
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:25,760
I want to wish for this moment.

1804
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:28,120
I have been looking at you.

1805
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:31,780
I can't say it with courage.

1806
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:33,480
It's basically saying like...

1807
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:35,840
I will muster the courage.

1808
02:10:37,300 --> 02:10:37,820
Wait.

1809
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:39,040
Wait.

1810
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:41,700
I messed up.

1811
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,280
I messed up.

1812
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:44,200
I got the wrong part.

1813
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,340
I got the...

1814
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,060
Hold on.

1815
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:47,940
Hold on.

1816
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:49,060
Wait a minute.

1817
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:50,780
Let me split it apart like this.

1818
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:52,440
For me to easily remember.

1819
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:53,520
Hold on.

1820
02:10:54,540 --> 02:10:55,220
Hold on.

1821
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:55,500
Hold on.

1822
02:10:56,620 --> 02:10:57,900
I have been looking at you.

1823
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:00,440
I want to wish for this moment.

1824
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:03,800
I will never let go of your hand.

1825
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:04,880
Wait.

1826
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:08,140
I will never let go of your hand.

1827
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:11,920
I want to wish for this moment.

1828
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:14,520
I have been looking at you.

1829
02:11:15,580 --> 02:11:17,380
And then this part is...

1830
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:19,200
I can't say it with courage.

1831
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:21,080
Oh wait.

1832
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:21,260
No.

1833
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:22,160
I can't say it.

1834
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,680
But...

1835
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,940
This feeling that pierces my heart.

1836
02:11:26,940 --> 02:11:30,540
This feeling that pierces my heart.

1837
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:31,240
I love you, Mint.

1838
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:37,940
I love you.

1839
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:39,200
One more time.

1840
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:39,780
Let's try it again.

1841
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:44,440
See you.

1842
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,320
I swear to the stars.

1843
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:49,560
I will muster the courage.

1844
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:53,940
I will never let go of your hand.

1845
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:56,080
I want to wish for this moment.

1846
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:59,860
I have been looking at you.

1847
02:12:00,540 --> 02:12:02,580
I can't say it with courage.

1848
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:06,340
But this feeling that pierces my heart.

1849
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:07,600
I love you, Mint.

1850
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:10,940
I love you.

1851
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,080
Do you remember?

1852
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:13,940
Are you ok?

1853
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:15,660
Again.

1854
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:16,580
Do you know it now?

1855
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:17,720
There we go.

1856
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:20,000
Now we know it.

1857
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:23,940
We learned it together.

1858
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:25,780
We learned it together.

1859
02:12:28,830 --> 02:12:29,730
I don't remember.

1860
02:12:30,910 --> 02:12:32,130
Practice more.

1861
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:34,710
Everyone practice properly.

1862
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:37,730
I don't remember at all.

1863
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:39,610
Learn it.

1864
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:40,510
Practice it.

1865
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:46,010
Practice it.

1866
02:12:48,130 --> 02:12:49,270
This one is kind of...

1867
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:53,910
It's hard to learn sometimes the calls that are for song specific stuff, you know?

1868
02:12:59,090 --> 02:12:59,730
It's ok.

1869
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:04,750
Denpogumi has a couple and they are very long.

1870
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:07,190
They are very very long.

1871
02:13:07,650 --> 02:13:08,410
It's hard to remember.

1872
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:12,550
Oh my gosh.

1873
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:13,610
Did you guys see the picture?

1874
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:14,430
Hold on, let me grab it.

1875
02:13:14,430 --> 02:13:15,670
The picture I posted on Twitter.

1876
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:18,010
This one.

1877
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,870
I took it.

1878
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:21,150
I went on a night walk.

1879
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:23,070
I went on a night walk.

1880
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:27,150
And even though it was so cold.

1881
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,850
It was so cold.

1882
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:32,010
I saw this.

1883
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:35,350
Like this.

1884
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:35,690
See it?

1885
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:37,890
The three stars that make a triangle.

1886
02:13:38,150 --> 02:13:39,390
That's the moon by the way.

1887
02:13:39,770 --> 02:13:40,530
It's not the sun.

1888
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:41,830
It's the moon.

1889
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:43,830
And the three stars.

1890
02:13:44,610 --> 02:13:45,610
I was like oh my gosh.

1891
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:51,170
It's spring but I saw the stars and I was like...

1892
02:13:52,570 --> 02:13:56,130
And then when I was walking around I had that song stuck in my head.

1893
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:04,830
So I kind of wanted to sing Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari because it was stuck in my head the other night.

1894
02:14:05,690 --> 02:14:07,030
Because I was walking around.

1895
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:09,770
Did you point and say the names?

1896
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:15,650
With your phone?

1897
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:17,530
Yeah, that was with my phone.

1898
02:14:21,410 --> 02:14:21,750
Maybe.

1899
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:28,510
I don't know actually.

1900
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:32,070
There is another song I want to sing.

1901
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:35,070
This song I feel is very...

1902
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:41,430
Let me see if...

1903
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:44,070
This song feels like a...

1904
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:48,950
I don't think I've ever sung this song before.

1905
02:14:49,150 --> 02:14:50,310
Oh, I forgot to do.

1906
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:58,930
It feels like a fall song to me so I want to sing it.

1907
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:04,010
This will probably 100% get claimed.

1908
02:15:04,190 --> 02:15:04,750
But that's okay.

1909
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:18,290
If it gets claimed to where it gets blocked in countries I'll just censor it.

1910
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:23,450
But this song is all about seasons.

1911
02:15:29,570 --> 02:15:30,330
It was!

1912
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:32,690
It was so pretty.

1913
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:35,530
And then next to the Tokyo Tower.

1914
02:15:37,150 --> 02:15:39,050
It was so nice.

1915
02:15:48,170 --> 02:15:50,650
Why isn't the lyrics loading?

1916
02:15:50,830 --> 02:15:51,410
This sucks.

1917
02:16:02,090 --> 02:16:02,930
Oh, I got it.

1918
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:06,310
This is actually... I don't think I've ever sung this song before.

1919
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:08,870
It's by an idol group called Keyakizaka46.

1920
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:10,990
Which, they're not around anymore.

1921
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:16,730
They got like changed into... Are they now Sakurazaka I think?

1922
02:16:17,290 --> 02:16:17,510
Maybe?

1923
02:16:19,930 --> 02:16:20,410
I think?

1924
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:27,930
What did they change into?

1925
02:16:30,830 --> 02:16:32,470
What did they change into?

1926
02:16:33,330 --> 02:16:34,150
I can't remember.

1927
02:16:35,850 --> 02:16:36,410
Anyway.

1928
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:46,330
Sorry, I'm spacing out.

1929
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:49,130
Let me make sure this instrumental is good.

1930
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:51,290
Let me make sure.

1931
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:57,650
Okay, it's like an immediate start so I have to be on my toes.

1932
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:10,540
How do you guys think of the new... I changed my...

1933
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:14,140
Why am I blinking like a frog?

1934
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:17,920
I changed my karaoke set... or not karaoke, sorry.

1935
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:19,720
Oh my gosh, I think I'm starting to crash out.

1936
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:23,860
That's not the mean... wait, that's not how that works.

1937
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:27,480
I'm starting to crash a little bit.

1938
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,440
I changed my reverb settings a little bit.

1939
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:33,740
I don't know how it sounds though.

1940
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:35,360
If it sounds okay.

1941
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:37,680
Minky tired.

1942
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:39,200
I'm so eepy.

1943
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,780
I'm so eepy!

1944
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:42,840
And I'm getting hungry.

1945
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,160
Crash bandicoot.

1946
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:48,220
It sounds good?

1947
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:49,920
Okay, cool.

1948
02:18:39,810 --> 02:18:46,530
I'm so eepy.

1949
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:15,710
I'm so eepy.

1950
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:46,530
I'm so eepy.

1951
02:20:45,790 --> 02:20:48,590
I'm so eepy.

1952
02:21:08,130 --> 02:21:21,090
I'm so eepy.

1953
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:51,570
I'm so eepy.

1954
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:21,530
I'm so eepy.

1955
02:22:23,230 --> 02:22:24,630
I'm

1956
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:29,170
so eepy.

1957
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:38,360
Yeah.

1958
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:41,460
That was Futari Saison.

1959
02:22:42,580 --> 02:22:44,500
Futari Saison.

1960
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,220
Futari Saison.

1961
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:49,700
Saison.

1962
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,420
Saison.

1963
02:22:54,460 --> 02:22:59,010
Thank you!

1964
02:23:03,350 --> 02:23:06,950
I feel like those kinds of songs are much better sung as a group.

1965
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:09,070
So I recommend listening to the original.

1966
02:23:09,350 --> 02:23:12,710
And oh my gosh, their uniforms in the music video are so pretty.

1967
02:23:14,710 --> 02:23:16,710
Hi, I'm glad you're back even though I'm missing the radio.

1968
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:19,190
Thank you!

1969
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:21,170
Ayumi Hamasaki's Depend On You.

1970
02:23:21,290 --> 02:23:22,930
I don't think I know it.

1971
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:27,730
I don't think I know it, I'm sorry.

1972
02:23:32,330 --> 02:23:33,630
Never misses on the uniforms.

1973
02:23:33,690 --> 02:23:34,710
They were so good!

1974
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:36,850
Unwritten.

1975
02:23:38,470 --> 02:23:39,790
I can do unwritten.

1976
02:23:40,250 --> 02:23:42,330
But every time I sing that song, people are like, it's the...

1977
02:23:43,570 --> 02:23:44,570
Laundry detergent?

1978
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:45,450
Or whatever.

1979
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:48,870
Is that a spring song?

1980
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:49,350
Unwritten?

1981
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:56,760
Wasn't this used in an ad for...

1982
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:00,720
For laundry or something?

1983
02:24:10,030 --> 02:24:10,830
Unwritten.

1984
02:24:11,410 --> 02:24:13,330
Can't read my mind.

1985
02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:20,970
Okay, redo because the lead vocals were on.

1986
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:36,170
Unwritten.

1987
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:38,250
Can't read my mind.

1988
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:45,750
I'm just beginning.

1989
02:24:46,430 --> 02:24:48,410
The pen's in my hand.

1990
02:24:48,970 --> 02:24:51,950
Ending unplanned.

1991
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:55,670
Staring at the blank page before you.

1992
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:58,050
Open up the dirty window.

1993
02:24:58,390 --> 02:25:02,150
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find.

1994
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:04,850
Reaching for something in the distance.

1995
02:25:05,470 --> 02:25:07,710
So close you can almost taste it.

1996
02:25:07,970 --> 02:25:09,810
Release your inhibitions.

1997
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:12,070
Feel the rain on your skin.

1998
02:25:12,390 --> 02:25:14,630
No one else can feel it for you.

1999
02:25:14,770 --> 02:25:16,770
Only you can let it in.

2000
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:19,750
Why does she say ah the entire song?

2001
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:23,530
She doesn't stop!

2002
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,380
When your book begins, the rest is still unwritten.

2003
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:32,400
Even there!

2004
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,020
I break

2005
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:43,350
tradition.

2006
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:48,630
Sometimes my tries are outside the lines.

2007
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:55,510
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes.

2008
02:25:55,710 --> 02:25:57,750
But I can't live that way.

2009
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:58,770
Oh no.

2010
02:25:59,930 --> 02:26:02,930
Out of the blank page before you.

2011
02:26:03,230 --> 02:26:05,210
Out of the dirty window.

2012
02:26:05,550 --> 02:26:09,190
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find.

2013
02:26:09,450 --> 02:26:12,370
Out for something in the distance.

2014
02:26:12,750 --> 02:26:14,870
Oh so close you can almost taste it.

2015
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:17,030
Release your inhibitions.

2016
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:18,750
Feel the rain on your...

2017
02:26:19,530 --> 02:26:20,370
May I ask?

2018
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:28,990
No one else, no one else can speak the words on your lips.

2019
02:26:29,330 --> 02:26:31,430
Drench yourself in words unspoken.

2020
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,750
With arms wide open.

2021
02:26:34,010 --> 02:26:36,670
Today is where your book begins.

2022
02:26:36,930 --> 02:26:38,450
The rain on your skin.

2023
02:26:38,810 --> 02:26:40,990
No one else can feel it for you.

2024
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:43,250
Only you can let it in.

2025
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:48,030
No one else, no one else can speak the words on your...

2026
02:26:48,030 --> 02:26:49,030
Drench yourself.

2027
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:24,700
Release your inhibitions.

2028
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:30,100
Feel the rain on your skin.

2029
02:27:30,420 --> 02:27:32,600
No one else can feel it for you.

2030
02:27:32,780 --> 02:27:34,800
Only you can let it in.

2031
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:39,420
No one else, no one else can speak the words on your...

2032
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:42,140
Drench yourself in words unspoken.

2033
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:44,520
Live your life with arms wide open.

2034
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:47,030
Today is where your book begins.

2035
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:49,280
Feel the rain on your skin.

2036
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:51,780
No one else can feel it for you.

2037
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:54,000
Only you can let it in.

2038
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:58,920
No one else, no one else can speak the words on your...

2039
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:00,740
Drench yourself in words unspoken.

2040
02:28:00,740 --> 02:28:01,820
I can't anymore.

2041
02:28:46,650 --> 02:28:47,870
You guys have to understand.

2042
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:49,330
Hold on, let me show you what I'm seeing.

2043
02:28:49,710 --> 02:28:51,030
Let me show you what I'm seeing.

2044
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:54,190
Because it shows up in the background of the video, right?

2045
02:28:54,850 --> 02:28:56,150
Like, hold on, carophone.

2046
02:28:57,950 --> 02:29:00,670
So while I'm singing it, I just see the little...

2047
02:29:01,710 --> 02:29:02,430
The little...

2048
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:05,470
Just popping up over and over and over again.

2049
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:07,650
Hold on, I'll show you.

2050
02:29:08,410 --> 02:29:09,550
I'll show you, I'll show you.

2051
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:10,850
Oh, I don't want you to see.

2052
02:29:10,930 --> 02:29:11,230
Hold on.

2053
02:29:11,230 --> 02:29:12,850
I don't know what that QR code goes to.

2054
02:29:13,150 --> 02:29:15,010
I don't want you to put it in songs.

2055
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:16,030
I don't know if it does that.

2056
02:29:16,150 --> 02:29:16,850
That would be scary.

2057
02:29:17,250 --> 02:29:18,630
Okay, hold on.

2058
02:29:20,980 --> 02:29:21,900
Do you see it?

2059
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:39,470
I just see it in the background over and over again.

2060
02:30:04,750 --> 02:30:06,290
And then even in the chorus.

2061
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,600
I can't stop seeing it.

2062
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:25,300
I can't stop seeing it, you guys.

2063
02:30:27,980 --> 02:30:33,340
Sorry, I couldn't take the song seriously.

2064
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:35,920
Unwritten.

2065
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:37,320
Written.

2066
02:30:44,740 --> 02:30:49,560
Is it rare for songs to include... Is that rare for songs to include in a karaoke?

2067
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:54,220
I think to that extent, maybe.

2068
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:00,920
Unwritten.

2069
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:06,460
You sound like Yoshi Yoshi.

2070
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,400
Oh my gosh, I love that song.

2071
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:12,380
Kaerimichi wa.

2072
02:31:13,020 --> 02:31:14,100
Kaerimichi wa.

2073
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:19,000
It's a little fast for me though.

2074
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:22,900
Maybe next time.

2075
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:24,300
Maybe next time.

2076
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:24,800
Let me see.

2077
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:27,560
I wonder if they have it on here.

2078
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:29,240
No.

2079
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:31,560
I love that song though.

2080
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:35,380
Kaerimichi wa.

2081
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,080
Kaerimichi wa.

2082
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:39,180
Orange from ToraDora!

2083
02:31:40,460 --> 02:31:42,160
Doing a lot of JP songs today.

2084
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:42,960
That's okay though.

2085
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:46,560
ToraDora.

2086
02:31:48,280 --> 02:31:49,440
I love this song.

2087
02:31:57,110 --> 02:31:58,770
The new Gundam movie has some amazing songs.

2088
02:31:58,850 --> 02:31:59,850
Worth a watch if you have a chance.

2089
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:00,930
Oh, yes!

2090
02:32:01,030 --> 02:32:02,370
Wasn't it in theaters?

2091
02:32:03,850 --> 02:32:05,350
In North America recently?

2092
02:32:05,950 --> 02:32:06,130
No?

2093
02:32:06,470 --> 02:32:08,690
Am I... Yes?

2094
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:09,710
Right?

2095
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:21,660
Oh my gosh.

2096
02:33:59,350 --> 02:34:01,410
I love you.

2097
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:04,310
I love you.

2098
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,040
I love you.

2099
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:11,440
No, it's not like that.

2100
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:13,140
Mandarin orange.

2101
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:15,720
Mandarin orange.

2102
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:27,320
I ran away.

2103
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:32,920
Then, the light won't shine on me.

2104
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:34,880
won't shine on me.

2105
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:36,220
Even though it's a miracle.

2106
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:36,440
Even though it's a miracle.

2107
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:37,840
Even though it's a miracle.

2108
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:47,460
Encounters, love, seeds, and buds are still blue.

2109
02:35:14,330 --> 02:35:17,390
I don't want to know my future.

2110
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:19,890
I ate everything.

2111
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:21,710
It's sour.

2112
02:35:23,910 --> 02:35:30,230
I love you, but I'll cry.

2113
02:35:37,610 --> 02:35:43,970
I love you, so I'll cry.

2114
02:35:49,230 --> 02:35:51,030
Because I can't

2115
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:13,560
leave you like me.

2116
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:28,740
I love you.

2117
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:32,700
I love you.

2118
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:35,120
It's sour.

2119
02:36:40,730 --> 02:36:42,230
I love you.

2120
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:45,650
I love you.

2121
02:36:50,110 --> 02:36:50,750
Yay!

2122
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:53,850
That was orange.

2123
02:36:57,410 --> 02:36:59,670
I should give you guys the gift now.

2124
02:37:00,610 --> 02:37:01,830
Before I forget.

2125
02:37:02,490 --> 02:37:03,610
Because I just saw it.

2126
02:37:04,390 --> 02:37:06,210
I have to remember to give it to you guys.

2127
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:09,670
It was a Mito day.

2128
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:12,830
Actually, I had two things that I wanted to give you guys.

2129
02:37:12,930 --> 02:37:14,590
But the other thing won't be done until later.

2130
02:37:15,130 --> 02:37:18,430
So, please accept this small little gift from me.

2131
02:37:26,530 --> 02:37:29,830
It's a Mito original outfit.

2132
02:37:30,170 --> 02:37:30,650
Wallpaper!

2133
02:37:31,430 --> 02:37:33,310
Made by my mama.

2134
02:37:33,910 --> 02:37:34,730
Ayami mama!

2135
02:37:34,730 --> 02:37:34,970
Yeah!

2136
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:38,590
So, I'll upload this afterwards.

2137
02:37:39,910 --> 02:37:42,050
In the community tab.

2138
02:37:42,670 --> 02:37:44,850
So, I just, you know, thank you guys.

2139
02:37:45,350 --> 02:37:46,730
I thought it would be cute.

2140
02:37:47,170 --> 02:37:48,430
There's a few changes.

2141
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:49,850
I can see.

2142
02:37:53,230 --> 02:37:55,670
It's the old outfit, but with a few changes.

2143
02:38:00,070 --> 02:38:00,550
Yeah.

2144
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:00,770
Yeah.

2145
02:38:03,790 --> 02:38:06,510
Of course, with my new hair and everything.

2146
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:10,510
But, yay!

2147
02:38:12,450 --> 02:38:15,770
It may or may not be an opai window.

2148
02:38:16,290 --> 02:38:17,270
Where the opai at?

2149
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:23,050
And then she added some cuffs to my wrists, which I think are pretty cute.

2150
02:38:23,630 --> 02:38:24,290
And a choker.

2151
02:38:25,350 --> 02:38:26,330
I hardly even know her.

2152
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,830
Yeah!

2153
02:38:31,530 --> 02:38:33,810
So, I'll upload this after stream.

2154
02:38:34,330 --> 02:38:35,830
For you guys to use.

2155
02:38:36,010 --> 02:38:37,810
For your...

2156
02:38:37,810 --> 02:38:38,890
If you want to.

2157
02:38:39,070 --> 02:38:41,130
I think it's pretty cute.

2158
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:42,690
So, you know.

2159
02:38:43,490 --> 02:38:44,630
Opai window.

2160
02:38:51,010 --> 02:38:51,730
It's...

2161
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:53,730
Oh, I...

2162
02:38:58,370 --> 02:38:59,350
Yeah.

2163
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:01,130
Yeah.

2164
02:39:02,130 --> 02:39:03,850
So, yes.

2165
02:39:05,310 --> 02:39:08,070
Thank you Ayami Mama for creating that.

2166
02:39:08,670 --> 02:39:09,330
For...

2167
02:39:09,330 --> 02:39:11,690
For Minto Day.

2168
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:14,750
For Minto Day.

2169
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,830
She's pointing at me.

2170
02:39:16,030 --> 02:39:18,130
It could be you.

2171
02:39:21,730 --> 02:39:23,090
It could be you.

2172
02:39:23,590 --> 02:39:26,610
Another song I want to sing because I listen to this song.

2173
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:30,210
Actually, I have a couple songs.

2174
02:39:31,030 --> 02:39:33,950
This one, I never do it justice, but I like singing it anyway.

2175
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:38,870
Because I like this song a whole lot.

2176
02:39:39,070 --> 02:39:42,850
So, I'm gonna sing it and I heard it at Holofest.

2177
02:39:43,550 --> 02:39:45,030
Well, I wasn't at the fest.

2178
02:39:45,130 --> 02:39:48,110
I heard it at Expo, but they were playing it.

2179
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:49,030
Okay.

2180
02:40:03,080 --> 02:40:03,200
Oh!

2181
02:40:32,390 --> 02:40:33,770
Star Wars!

2182
02:40:34,450 --> 02:40:35,070
Star Wars!

2183
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:51,670
Star Wars!

2184
02:41:29,470 --> 02:41:32,270
Star Wars!

2185
02:41:32,410 --> 02:41:35,970
Star Wars!

2186
02:41:35,990 --> 02:41:36,750
Star Wars!

2187
02:41:58,730 --> 02:42:01,530
Star Wars!

2188
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:42,420
Star Wars!

2189
02:43:09,620 --> 02:43:12,420
Star Wars!

2190
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:26,910
Star Wars Star Wars

2191
02:43:45,340 --> 02:44:22,620
Star Wars Star Wars I won't tell you, still love, still love, in the middle of the universe Tonight's music will surely, surely never stop That's right, what I've always wanted to become Isn't a waiting Cinderella I'm a prince going to the deep sea Because I'm a star That's

2192
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:33,700
right, I was a star

2193
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:45,480
Stella, Stella

2194
02:44:59,750 --> 02:45:00,510
Stella...

2195
02:45:02,430 --> 02:45:03,190
Stella...

2196
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:04,890
I'll do 20 songs today.

2197
02:45:06,290 --> 02:45:08,090
I'll do 20 songs today.

2198
02:45:09,310 --> 02:45:10,750
Here I go flying!

2199
02:45:10,990 --> 02:45:12,150
Never do it justice.

2200
02:45:12,650 --> 02:45:15,730
I always feel like I mess it up in the middle.

2201
02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:21,270
And that my voice is not powerful enough for the chorus.

2202
02:45:25,530 --> 02:45:30,250
That's the one I saw live, like I was at the creator stage.

2203
02:45:30,250 --> 02:45:31,990
And I got so...

2204
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:46,230
I don't remember the verses.

2205
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:48,990
Because I've only heard the... what's it called?

2206
02:45:49,470 --> 02:45:55,810
The chorus so much because of like shorts and everything.

2207
02:45:56,670 --> 02:45:59,590
So I don't remember how the verses go.

2208
02:46:00,650 --> 02:46:02,690
I'll sing Bibbidi another time.

2209
02:46:06,490 --> 02:46:07,930
There's another song I want to sing.

2210
02:46:08,030 --> 02:46:09,270
This one's a little more low key.

2211
02:46:11,710 --> 02:46:12,350
Wait, hold on.

2212
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:17,820
One second, one second.

2213
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:24,190
Hold on, hold on.

2214
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:37,200
Next song!

2215
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:37,280
Next song.

2216
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:42,140
The whole is just karaoke Bibbidi on the karaoke.

2217
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:44,400
That's so funny.

2218
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,220
Oh yeah, I saw that they were doing like a Big Off collab, right?

2219
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:52,960
This song is dedicated to my tiny snake.

2220
02:46:54,020 --> 02:46:54,980
My little guy.

2221
02:47:19,930 --> 02:48:28,460
Just like me They long to be close to you Why do stars fall down from the sky Every time you walk by Just like me They long to be close to you On the day that you were born, the angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair And golden starlight in your eyes of blue That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around Just like me,

2222
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:33,980
they long to be close to you

2223
02:48:58,630 --> 02:49:43,870
On the day that you were born, the angels got together And decided to create a dream come true So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair And golden starlight in your eyes of blue That is why all the girls in town Follow you all around Just like me, they long to be close to you Just like me,

2224
02:49:44,590 --> 02:49:51,730
they long to be close to you

2225
02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:21,150
I'm kissing him now Mwa, mwa mwa snake Mwa, mwa Mwa, mwa my little snake Mwa, mwa, mwa You're so cute Mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa Mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa Mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa, mwa I'm getting...

2226
02:50:26,670 --> 02:50:30,490
...Cloooose to you I'm giving him big old grandma kisses

2227
02:50:52,590 --> 02:50:54,690
This one's dedicated to your snake.

2228
02:50:56,010 --> 02:50:58,570
This guy is clean because he stays on my desk.

2229
02:50:58,950 --> 02:51:02,670
And then I have the little snake that goes on my journeys with me in my bag.

2230
02:51:02,670 --> 02:51:08,690
And then I have four more in my cabinet, in my display cabinet.

2231
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:12,910
I'm kissing him like I kiss my cat.

2232
02:51:22,230 --> 02:51:23,630
Yeah, I have six of them.

2233
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:25,430
I have six.

2234
02:51:26,690 --> 02:51:27,550
I want more.

2235
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:29,930
Oh my god, someone sent me a post... a picture.

2236
02:51:30,590 --> 02:51:34,130
They posted a picture on Twitter earlier.

2237
02:51:35,210 --> 02:51:36,830
And they said they went to the cafe.

2238
02:51:37,310 --> 02:51:42,510
And then they said that they went to a store and saw a whole box of snakes, like figures and stuff.

2239
02:51:42,670 --> 02:51:45,570
And they had the little, the little power pro snake.

2240
02:51:46,410 --> 02:51:49,930
And oh my gosh, guess how much it was they were trying to sell it for.

2241
02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:54,070
Guess, guess how many, how much they were trying to sell it for.

2242
02:51:54,570 --> 02:51:55,510
Guess how much.

2243
02:51:56,190 --> 02:51:56,990
Okay, I'll tell you.

2244
02:51:57,310 --> 02:51:58,110
Okay, I'll tell you.

2245
02:51:59,190 --> 02:52:03,730
For 50 bucks, 4,000, almost 4,000 yen.

2246
02:52:05,290 --> 02:52:07,430
It was like almost 5,000 yen.

2247
02:52:08,290 --> 02:52:09,490
That's insane.

2248
02:52:09,950 --> 02:52:11,390
That's actually insane.

2249
02:52:11,810 --> 02:52:15,710
Every time I bought one of these, it's been like at most 1,000 yen.

2250
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:18,010
Like so much money.

2251
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:22,030
So yeah, what a scam.

2252
02:52:23,010 --> 02:52:25,350
What a scam to increase the resale.

2253
02:52:25,550 --> 02:52:27,330
No, I'm not reselling them though.

2254
02:52:28,470 --> 02:52:29,790
It's like 25, 30 dollars.

2255
02:52:29,930 --> 02:52:31,590
That's still a crazy amount.

2256
02:52:32,310 --> 02:52:33,290
Still a crazy amount.

2257
02:52:34,470 --> 02:52:35,430
So much.

2258
02:52:36,130 --> 02:52:36,890
There was something else.

2259
02:52:37,090 --> 02:52:39,890
Oh, and also, I went to At Home with Dusko.

2260
02:52:42,750 --> 02:52:44,490
And I got a maid.

2261
02:52:45,050 --> 02:52:52,290
And I chose her because at At Home, they show like what kind of things they're interested in.

2262
02:52:52,310 --> 02:52:53,530
And she had some similar stuff.

2263
02:52:53,850 --> 02:52:55,390
And I was like, oh, I want to talk to her.

2264
02:52:55,710 --> 02:52:57,710
And so, she came over.

2265
02:52:57,950 --> 02:53:01,850
And she saw my little snake on the table.

2266
02:53:01,850 --> 02:53:04,550
And she was like, snake?

2267
02:53:05,150 --> 02:53:08,010
And I was like, you know who this is?

2268
02:53:08,230 --> 02:53:10,010
And she knew him from Smash Brothers.

2269
02:53:10,270 --> 02:53:12,290
But she was like, wow, I've never...

2270
02:53:12,290 --> 02:53:18,750
She was like, I've never met a girl who did Oshikatsu from Metal Gear.

2271
02:53:21,390 --> 02:53:22,290
It's me!

2272
02:53:22,430 --> 02:53:24,310
I'm the Oshikatsu Metal Gear!

2273
02:53:27,910 --> 02:53:28,450
Yeah!

2274
02:53:29,190 --> 02:53:29,770
It's me!

2275
02:53:29,770 --> 02:53:31,830
You guys, I have to pee so bad.

2276
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:32,230
Hold on.

2277
02:53:32,510 --> 02:53:34,210
Listen to...

2278
02:53:34,210 --> 02:53:35,890
Here, I'll put on a song for you.

2279
02:53:37,190 --> 02:53:37,610
Hold on.

2280
02:53:37,950 --> 02:53:40,850
I'll put on a song for you and I will be back before the song is over.

2281
02:53:42,290 --> 02:53:43,550
I have to pee so bad.

2282
02:53:43,610 --> 02:53:45,390
I've been holding it in for like the past half hour.

2283
02:56:39,490 --> 02:56:40,330
Okay, good.

2284
02:56:40,670 --> 02:56:41,630
It's over now.

2285
02:56:42,350 --> 02:56:42,750
Okay, good.

2286
02:56:42,750 --> 02:56:42,750
It's over now.

2287
02:56:42,750 --> 02:56:43,870
Sorry, I also got some more food.

2288
02:56:48,810 --> 02:56:50,190
Take all your bags.

2289
02:56:54,210 --> 02:56:54,590
Sorry.

2290
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:07,780
You are messed up and you hate me?

2291
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:08,440
What do you mean?

2292
02:57:09,740 --> 02:57:10,760
What are you talking about?

2293
02:57:12,720 --> 02:57:14,640
You guys don't want to hear it?

2294
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:18,660
Why do I hate you?

2295
02:57:29,360 --> 02:57:35,560
Chiragdor Okay, I'll sing something nice.

2296
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,300
I'll sing something nice.

2297
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:39,120
What should I...

2298
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:40,200
What's something nice?

2299
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:41,960
What's something that you guys actually want to hear?

2300
02:57:44,620 --> 02:57:45,340
I'll do...

2301
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:47,680
I have three more songs.

2302
02:57:50,380 --> 02:57:51,220
Don't do that!

2303
02:57:55,580 --> 02:57:58,340
Do you want me to actually lose my jaw?

2304
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:02,720
Wichita Line, man!

2305
02:58:02,800 --> 02:58:03,920
Oh my gosh, I love that one.

2306
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:04,440
Okay, hold on.

2307
02:58:04,480 --> 02:58:05,920
I'm seeing a couple that I think I can do.

2308
02:58:06,240 --> 02:58:07,080
I'll do Wichita.

2309
02:58:08,260 --> 02:58:10,240
That's crazy, you're requesting that song.

2310
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:12,800
I thought nobody ever knew that song.

2311
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,420
Wichita Line, man.

2312
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:19,600
I'm not doing break stuff.

2313
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:20,780
No, sorry.

2314
02:58:32,210 --> 02:58:33,710
Didn't I try before?

2315
02:58:35,010 --> 02:58:39,570
Sorry, I'm wheezing while driving home.

2316
02:58:39,570 --> 02:58:40,870
I'm sorry.

2317
02:58:42,850 --> 02:58:43,250
Wait.

2318
02:58:43,690 --> 02:58:45,410
Actually, I want to see if they have any of these.

2319
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:46,590
Let me see, hold on.

2320
02:58:48,190 --> 02:58:49,950
I might do something...

2321
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:52,390
I might do something a little unconventional.

2322
02:58:52,710 --> 02:58:53,430
If they have any.

2323
02:58:56,890 --> 02:58:57,670
They don't.

2324
02:58:57,890 --> 02:58:58,750
You guys got lucky.

2325
02:59:04,790 --> 02:59:06,190
Wait, what else was it?

2326
02:59:07,370 --> 02:59:08,590
I saw other things.

2327
02:59:11,850 --> 02:59:13,410
It's been forever since you sang it.

2328
02:59:13,470 --> 02:59:13,870
Sang what?

2329
02:59:17,830 --> 02:59:18,790
Space Oddity?

2330
02:59:19,310 --> 02:59:22,090
We're just going full Metal Gear, huh?

2331
02:59:25,810 --> 02:59:28,330
Well, you guys are always...

2332
02:59:28,330 --> 02:59:29,270
Ikenai Borderline.

2333
02:59:29,350 --> 02:59:30,270
Okay, I can do that one.

2334
02:59:30,850 --> 02:59:31,410
That's two.

2335
02:59:38,350 --> 02:59:39,470
Can't stop the loneliness.

2336
02:59:40,150 --> 02:59:43,490
We're Touchy on the Floor by Bruno Mars.

2337
02:59:43,890 --> 02:59:45,270
No, I don't know it.

2338
02:59:47,770 --> 02:59:49,910
I don't listen to a lot of Bruno Mars.

2339
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:52,470
No, wait.

2340
02:59:52,530 --> 02:59:53,190
Is that the...

2341
02:59:53,810 --> 02:59:54,970
That's not that one, right?

2342
02:59:56,190 --> 02:59:57,610
Appachoo, appachoo.

2343
02:59:57,910 --> 02:59:59,110
Appachoo, appachoo.

2344
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:00,810
Appachoo, appachoo.

2345
03:00:17,730 --> 03:00:19,250
Appachoo, appachoo.

2346
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:20,310
That's APT.

2347
03:00:23,050 --> 03:00:24,850
I would love everything when I look at you.

2348
03:00:25,570 --> 03:00:26,270
I don't.

2349
03:00:28,250 --> 03:00:28,670
What?

2350
03:00:28,670 --> 03:00:30,930
Wait, is that a song?

2351
03:00:33,710 --> 03:00:35,170
Achiagari by WUG?

2352
03:00:38,350 --> 03:00:40,050
Hold on, let's see.

2353
03:00:40,170 --> 03:00:41,670
Wake Up Girls.

2354
03:00:46,230 --> 03:00:47,910
Karaoke, Wake Up Girls.

2355
03:00:50,150 --> 03:00:52,550
I could probably do...

2356
03:00:54,250 --> 03:00:56,310
I'm trying to see if they have another WUG song.

2357
03:00:56,310 --> 03:00:59,030
I don't...

2358
03:00:59,030 --> 03:01:01,110
Have I ever tried singing Tachiagare?

2359
03:01:01,250 --> 03:01:02,030
I'm not sure.

2360
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:06,170
Okay.

2361
03:01:07,190 --> 03:01:08,490
I'll do this, this.

2362
03:01:11,450 --> 03:01:11,710
Okay.

2363
03:01:14,850 --> 03:01:15,230
Monkey.

2364
03:01:24,490 --> 03:01:27,350
I think this one, I think I have to put up two.

2365
03:01:28,670 --> 03:01:29,970
Wait, hold on!

2366
03:01:30,910 --> 03:01:31,550
Hold on!

2367
03:01:32,270 --> 03:01:33,770
Wait, hold on, not yet, not yet.

2368
03:01:34,970 --> 03:01:36,330
Gosh, I think two.

2369
03:01:37,310 --> 03:01:39,130
Hold on, let me hear what it sounds like real quick.

2370
03:01:50,200 --> 03:01:52,480
I'm a lineman for the county.

2371
03:01:57,740 --> 03:02:00,000
I don't remember how much I need to put it up.

2372
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:01,540
Hold on, sorry, I'm adjusting.

2373
03:02:02,900 --> 03:02:03,720
For the county.

2374
03:02:03,720 --> 03:02:05,600
Okay, we can do this one.

2375
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:10,920
Holding the line, holding the line.

2376
03:02:13,060 --> 03:02:14,260
I have to concentrate.

2377
03:02:14,620 --> 03:02:15,440
Sorry guys, hold on.

2378
03:02:17,700 --> 03:02:19,020
Maybe I could just do original.

2379
03:02:19,380 --> 03:02:19,700
Let's see.

2380
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:22,780
Sorry, I know you guys can't hear.

2381
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:24,820
For the county.

2382
03:02:26,520 --> 03:02:27,940
I'll do plus two, I'll do plus two.

2383
03:02:32,870 --> 03:02:35,690
And I drive the main road.

2384
03:02:36,810 --> 03:02:38,410
Or maybe plus one.

2385
03:02:48,590 --> 03:02:51,010
I love this song so much!

2386
03:02:51,090 --> 03:02:53,630
I'm glad that you guys like this song because I love this song.

2387
03:02:53,770 --> 03:02:56,310
I feel like a grandpa for loving this song.

2388
03:02:58,130 --> 03:02:58,690
Okay.

2389
03:03:09,350 --> 03:03:12,330
I am a lineman for the county.

2390
03:03:15,370 --> 03:03:19,150
And I drive the main road.

2391
03:03:20,130 --> 03:03:26,150
Searching in the sun for another overload.

2392
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:32,650
I hear you singing in the wire.

2393
03:03:35,170 --> 03:03:38,470
I can hear you through the wine.

2394
03:03:41,290 --> 03:03:51,570
And the Wichita lineman Is still on the line

2395
03:03:56,640 --> 03:04:21,990
I know I need a small vacation But it don't look like rain And if it snows That stretch down south Won't ever stand the strain And I need you more than want you.

2396
03:04:23,790 --> 03:04:28,950
And I want you for all time.

2397
03:04:30,030 --> 03:04:33,170
And the witcher's all on man.

2398
03:04:35,630 --> 03:04:38,230
He's still on the line.

2399
03:04:49,130 --> 03:04:50,250
Back in cheese break.

2400
03:04:50,250 --> 03:04:52,330
And I

2401
03:05:06,750 --> 03:05:09,670
need you more than want you.

2402
03:05:11,490 --> 03:05:16,790
And I want you for all time.

2403
03:05:17,610 --> 03:05:20,730
And the witcher's all on man.

2404
03:05:22,390 --> 03:05:24,050
Sorry, back in cheese.

2405
03:05:24,550 --> 03:05:25,830
He's still on the line.

2406
03:05:47,320 --> 03:05:49,540
The back in cheese is on the line.

2407
03:06:01,580 --> 03:06:03,580
There was a back in cheese in my throat.

2408
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:07,340
My car broke down you guys.

2409
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:09,920
The day before I left.

2410
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:16,820
So I can't get food.

2411
03:06:22,060 --> 03:06:23,260
I just...

2412
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:29,360
I sound like I have Fogo's Vintage filter on.

2413
03:06:30,020 --> 03:06:34,540
I had...basically my car has been having issues.

2414
03:06:35,020 --> 03:06:35,860
My mint mobile.

2415
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:44,830
I became Spongebob for like a second.

2416
03:06:44,990 --> 03:06:45,430
It's so true.

2417
03:06:51,570 --> 03:06:51,990
Thank you.

2418
03:06:51,990 --> 03:06:53,050
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

2419
03:06:53,050 --> 03:06:53,890
Thank you.

2420
03:07:00,390 --> 03:07:04,430
I've been having issues with my car where it will sometimes be like...

2421
03:07:07,270 --> 03:07:09,970
I didn't mean to be rude when I looked at you as the name of the song.

2422
03:07:12,830 --> 03:07:17,170
Felipe, I'm going to give you some advice if you request songs in the future.

2423
03:07:17,370 --> 03:07:19,410
Always include who the artist is.

2424
03:07:19,970 --> 03:07:22,630
Otherwise, I have no idea what the song is.

2425
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:26,030
So always include who the artist is.

2426
03:07:26,410 --> 03:07:27,930
I don't know the song.

2427
03:07:28,210 --> 03:07:28,790
I really don't.

2428
03:07:28,850 --> 03:07:29,150
I'm sorry.

2429
03:07:32,890 --> 03:07:34,470
This is serious.

2430
03:07:35,990 --> 03:07:39,470
I've been having issues where it will go...

2431
03:07:46,390 --> 03:07:49,410
I was so shocked.

2432
03:07:49,530 --> 03:07:51,470
I can't believe that it hasn't...

2433
03:07:53,970 --> 03:07:56,370
The check engine light hasn't come on yet.

2434
03:08:00,090 --> 03:08:01,550
I got a thing.

2435
03:08:01,630 --> 03:08:03,030
It's something to do with the transmission.

2436
03:08:03,030 --> 03:08:05,330
I got a little code reader or whatever.

2437
03:08:05,630 --> 03:08:06,430
I ordered one.

2438
03:08:06,930 --> 03:08:08,790
And it says it has something to do with the transmission.

2439
03:08:10,190 --> 03:08:12,090
So I was on the highway.

2440
03:08:14,370 --> 03:08:17,030
I was on the highway and...

2441
03:08:19,550 --> 03:08:21,010
I was going.

2442
03:08:21,450 --> 03:08:23,270
I'm just driving and it's doing this...

2443
03:08:26,890 --> 03:08:28,010
And suddenly...

2444
03:08:28,010 --> 03:08:31,150
There's the check engine light and then I...

2445
03:08:31,150 --> 03:08:35,390
And then the check engine light came on and then also...

2446
03:08:36,590 --> 03:08:38,010
It stopped accelerating.

2447
03:08:39,530 --> 03:08:43,870
So I was literally flooring it and it wasn't going fast.

2448
03:08:44,270 --> 03:08:45,610
And I was like...

2449
03:08:50,050 --> 03:08:52,090
I had to pull over.

2450
03:08:55,110 --> 03:08:59,010
Luckily, I was not on the highway and then I called a tow truck.

2451
03:09:01,670 --> 03:09:02,330
Yeah.

2452
03:09:03,270 --> 03:09:05,240
Now I have to...

2453
03:09:05,910 --> 03:09:09,450
I pulled over and it completely died.

2454
03:09:09,550 --> 03:09:10,550
It wouldn't move anymore.

2455
03:09:14,110 --> 03:09:14,770
So...

2456
03:09:16,790 --> 03:09:17,450
Yeah.

2457
03:09:19,810 --> 03:09:20,470
So...

2458
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:24,110
This here is out for me, I think.

2459
03:09:24,390 --> 03:09:27,050
If I weren't already dead, I think I would be dead.

2460
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:30,410
So...

2461
03:09:31,510 --> 03:09:32,510
Yeah.

2462
03:09:38,650 --> 03:09:44,290
Yeah, I've been going through it lately.

2463
03:09:45,370 --> 03:09:49,250
And so I have to now buy a new car.

2464
03:09:53,630 --> 03:09:54,630
Yeah.

2465
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:02,140
Sucks.

2466
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:03,820
That's stressing me out.

2467
03:10:03,860 --> 03:10:05,900
I think that's also why I got stress hives.

2468
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:15,800
Mobile phone.

2469
03:10:15,980 --> 03:10:16,740
Thank you!

2470
03:10:17,200 --> 03:10:17,900
Thank you.

2471
03:10:23,340 --> 03:10:23,960
Yeah.

2472
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:26,380
So I have to get a car.

2473
03:10:27,980 --> 03:10:30,620
I'm going to look for stuff after stream.

2474
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:32,940
Okay, I have two more songs I'm going to sing.

2475
03:10:33,260 --> 03:10:34,440
I already decided what they are.

2476
03:10:34,600 --> 03:10:36,240
So I'm going to sing those.

2477
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:40,160
I wonder actually if... Let's see.

2478
03:10:40,160 --> 03:10:40,620
Hmm,

2479
03:10:45,530 --> 03:10:46,290
hmm, hmm.

2480
03:10:52,630 --> 03:10:53,230
Oh!

2481
03:11:06,070 --> 03:11:08,750
Ohayo, ohayo, ohayo, ohayo.

2482
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:10,270
Pam, pam, pam, pam, pam, pam.

2483
03:11:10,370 --> 03:11:11,830
Ja, ha, ikudou.

2484
03:11:12,270 --> 03:11:13,410
Haiga, haiba.

2485
03:11:16,970 --> 03:11:18,750
Ja, ja, vaibou.

2486
03:11:19,170 --> 03:11:19,770
Waipa!

2487
03:11:20,770 --> 03:11:48,810
Yume wo miru nante kitto dekinai to Chiisana jibun wo mamori tsuzuketa Hidoku kizutsuite zankoku na umi ni Hana wo miresu guse wo muketa But you know, I am me.

2488
03:11:49,270 --> 03:11:51,090
I won't listen to any kind of deception.

2489
03:11:52,630 --> 03:11:56,230
I have no choice but to keep going without giving up.

2490
03:11:57,390 --> 03:11:58,250
I've made up my mind.

2491
03:11:58,890 --> 03:11:59,690
Wake up!

2492
03:12:00,270 --> 03:12:02,470
Bathe in the dazzling sunlight.

2493
03:12:05,210 --> 03:12:09,530
Now, the hope in my heart is overlapping with yours.

2494
03:12:11,250 --> 03:12:12,270
Stand up!

2495
03:12:12,270 --> 03:12:20,450
Because there is no night that never dawns, I believe in the smile of tomorrow.

2496
03:12:22,610 --> 03:12:29,910
I want to shine, my only one.

2497
03:12:31,750 --> 03:12:33,690
Now, let's go!

2498
03:12:34,410 --> 03:12:34,750
Come on!

2499
03:12:37,570 --> 03:12:38,550
Give me your heart!

2500
03:12:40,090 --> 03:12:42,830
I cried all the time.

2501
03:12:43,430 --> 03:12:45,390
I screamed all the time.

2502
03:12:46,870 --> 03:12:49,450
I kept searching for the lost love.

2503
03:12:53,470 --> 03:13:01,930
In the moment I stood at the edge of despair, I heard the gentle sound of the wind.

2504
03:13:04,770 --> 03:13:07,290
And then we met.

2505
03:13:08,010 --> 03:13:10,560
This is my stage.

2506
03:13:11,570 --> 03:13:15,370
Once again, I aim for that sky.

2507
03:13:16,630 --> 03:13:17,470
I flap my wings.

2508
03:13:17,810 --> 03:13:18,650
Wake up!

2509
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:20,970
You woke me up.

2510
03:13:23,950 --> 03:13:26,950
I don't want to cry anymore.

2511
03:13:26,950 --> 03:13:29,650
Because you are here.

2512
03:13:30,250 --> 03:13:31,270
Stand up!

2513
03:13:31,830 --> 03:13:35,630
There is a future ahead of us.

2514
03:13:35,970 --> 03:13:38,450
So now, let's go.

2515
03:13:39,590 --> 03:13:47,990
Keep looking at me, my only one.

2516
03:13:52,880 --> 03:13:56,880
I want to convey my feelings more and more.

2517
03:13:56,880 --> 03:14:04,100
No matter how much I get hurt, there is something I can't give up.

2518
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:07,320
Listen, listen.

2519
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:09,860
I'll sing desperately.

2520
03:14:10,660 --> 03:14:11,960
You can laugh at me.

2521
03:14:13,460 --> 03:14:14,780
I won't lose.

2522
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:16,460
One, two!

2523
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:17,920
Stand up!

2524
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:31,520
Wake up!

2525
03:14:31,820 --> 03:14:34,600
The dazzling sun is rising.

2526
03:14:36,200 --> 03:14:41,660
Now, the hope in my heart is overlapping with yours.

2527
03:14:42,780 --> 03:14:43,800
Stand up!

2528
03:14:44,400 --> 03:14:50,460
I believe in tomorrow's smile.

2529
03:14:54,360 --> 03:14:56,500
Wake up!

2530
03:14:58,280 --> 03:14:59,760
I'll deliver this prayer.

2531
03:15:01,580 --> 03:15:04,420
Now, I'm heading to my dream.

2532
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:07,060
Stretch out your hands.

2533
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:09,060
Stand up!

2534
03:15:09,680 --> 03:15:12,620
Let's run without hesitation.

2535
03:15:13,680 --> 03:15:26,620
In order to live in this world, I want to be with you, my only one.

2536
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:28,580
Thank you for the car fun!

2537
03:15:41,560 --> 03:15:43,160
Thank you very much, everybody.

2538
03:15:51,280 --> 03:15:52,160
Last song.

2539
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:54,340
Wow, it's already been three hours.

2540
03:15:57,680 --> 03:16:00,100
I will be streaming every day the rest of the week.

2541
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:03,080
I'll have my schedule out.

2542
03:16:08,020 --> 03:16:08,840
Tonight.

2543
03:16:09,420 --> 03:16:10,240
Tonight!

2544
03:16:10,860 --> 03:16:14,320
Sorry, today's stream has been so entirely scuffed.

2545
03:16:14,400 --> 03:16:14,960
I apologize.

2546
03:16:16,780 --> 03:16:19,140
But it's been fine, so...

2547
03:16:19,140 --> 03:16:21,300
Oh, setlist update!

2548
03:16:21,480 --> 03:16:21,920
Oh shoot.

2549
03:16:22,200 --> 03:16:23,140
Are we saying Wichita?

2550
03:16:25,480 --> 03:16:27,080
Wichita Lineman.

2551
03:16:27,680 --> 03:16:28,250
And then...

2552
03:16:28,760 --> 03:16:29,900
Stand up!

2553
03:16:31,320 --> 03:16:32,760
And now...

2554
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:34,740
Wait, did I sing something in between?

2555
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:36,700
Oh, close to you!

2556
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:37,060
Thank you.

2557
03:16:37,100 --> 03:16:37,940
I was like, wait a second.

2558
03:16:38,600 --> 03:16:39,020
17.

2559
03:16:41,200 --> 03:16:42,560
Close to you.

2560
03:16:42,940 --> 03:16:43,980
And then 20.

2561
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:48,560
I was gonna say, I thought I was doing a total of 20.

2562
03:16:49,780 --> 03:16:50,200
Okay.

2563
03:16:50,920 --> 03:16:52,720
You guys always request this song.

2564
03:16:54,720 --> 03:16:58,100
You guys always request this song, even though I sang it 50 times.

2565
03:16:58,100 --> 03:17:02,680
And I've probably sang it 50 more times since I sang it the original 50 times.

2566
03:17:03,800 --> 03:17:04,320
Yay.

2567
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:05,520
Okay.

2568
03:17:06,900 --> 03:17:07,260
Here I go.

2569
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:07,500
Nice.

2570
03:17:22,800 --> 03:17:23,380
Wow.

2571
03:17:26,100 --> 03:17:26,800
Sorry.

2572
03:18:07,290 --> 03:18:08,690
Sorry.

2573
03:18:23,410 --> 03:18:24,730
Sorry.

2574
03:19:14,990 --> 03:19:16,390
Wow.

2575
03:19:44,690 --> 03:19:46,090
Wow.

2576
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:32,400
Wow.

2577
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:53,040
Wow.

2578
03:21:35,620 --> 03:21:35,820
Wow.

2579
03:21:49,930 --> 03:21:50,630
Rest in glitch face.

2580
03:21:50,710 --> 03:21:51,150
I see it too.

2581
03:21:51,230 --> 03:21:52,390
Thank you so much for the Akadono!

2582
03:21:54,350 --> 03:21:56,350

2587

2592
03:22:13,390 --> 03:22:14,490
Thank you for karaoke!

2593
03:22:15,330 --> 03:22:17,110
Sorry I'm so jet lagged.

2594
03:22:20,470 --> 03:22:21,830
Yeah, but it was also fun!

2595
03:22:22,090 --> 03:22:22,550
Thank you guys!

2596
03:22:23,050 --> 03:22:23,510
Otsuminto!

2597
03:22:23,990 --> 03:22:24,590
Bye bye!

2598
03:22:24,850 --> 03:22:25,230
Bye bye!

2599
03:22:25,290 --> 03:22:25,610
