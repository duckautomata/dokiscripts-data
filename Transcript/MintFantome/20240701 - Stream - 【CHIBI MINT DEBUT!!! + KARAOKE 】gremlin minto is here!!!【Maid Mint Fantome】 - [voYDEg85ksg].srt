1
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,390
Welcome back, master, princess.

2
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,470
How many people are you?

3
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,170
That means... Translate or not.

4
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,870
How many people?

5
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,660
Just you.

6
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,760
So sad.

7
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,280
Follow me here to your table.

8
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,600
Oh, you're already there.

9
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,540
You self-seated.

10
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,160
Look at you.

11
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,480
You're so proactive, aren't you?

12
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,980
I mean, as you can see, it is a full house today.

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,160
You just got lucky.

14
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,500
We have many patrons of the spiritual kind.

15
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,660
Floating around here.

16
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes.

17
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,280
Yes, yes.

18
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,920
Yup.

19
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,080
I'll be honest, guys.

20
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,540
I have nothing planned.

21
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,720
So...

22
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:04,920
This will be probably the most boring generic reveal you've ever seen in your entire afterlife.

23
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,780
Actually, no.

24
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You guys are alive still, right?

25
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,960
Your entire life.

26
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,020
We're just gonna do it.

27
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,820
Are we?

28
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:20,970
Hold on.

29
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,790
I gotta stick with the story.

30
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,750
Master!

31
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,330
Princess!

32
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,190
Today, you will be served by a new maid.

33
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,350
Actually...

34
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,790
It's an old maid.

35
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,730
Wait, isn't that a game?

36
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,950
Anyway...

37
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,710
Wait...

38
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,630
Isn't that actually...

39
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,450
Old maid.

40
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,390
No.

41
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,310
She's a...

42
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,870
She's not old.

43
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,870
She's young at heart.

44
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,570
Well, she's also dead at heart.

45
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,810
But, um...

46
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,950
A new old maid.

47
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,840
Um...

48
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,880
Uh...

49
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,940
She took some medicine.

50
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,860
And it shrunk her.

51
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,660
Oh my god!

52
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,800
It was called...

53
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,900
MNTX4444.

54
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,980
It's a very...

55
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,720
It's an experimental drug.

56
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,700
On the black market.

57
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't ask me why she took it.

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,840
Because she's just a big old dummy.

59
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,500
Yes, MNTX.

60
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,760
No, no.

61
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,420
Not MM.

62
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
MNTX.

63
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,940
MNTX4444.

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,040
Yeah.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Not FDA approved.

66
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:37,800
Absolutely.

67
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,540
Sounds lewd.

68
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,340
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,180
Conan would want to work...

70
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,560
No, no, no.

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,020
It's legally distinct.

72
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,840
Actually.

73
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,440
TMNT.

74
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
I think we're...

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,420
I think we're in the wrong place.

76
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,460
But anyway...

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,280
Um...

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,820
Please don't...

79
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,260
Um...

80
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,520
Comment on her size.

81
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:57,980
You know?

82
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,280
She's a little self-conscious about it.

83
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,280
And just frankly embarrassed...

84
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,980
That she...

85
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
You know...

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,980
Just willingly...

87
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,260
Drank some medicine.

88
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, I wouldn't...

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,110
A drug...

90
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
I don't think I can say that it's drugs though.

91
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,000
Because...

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
I'll say it's...

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,980
Um...

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,840
A generic friend of Fox...

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,720
No!

96
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
But you know...

97
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,720
Just...

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:19,880
Just...

99
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,840
Just don't bring it up.

100
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,100
You know?

101
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,580
Just say it's...

102
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,920
Just say it's...

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,340
You know...

104
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,720
Just say she is...

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:27,740
Just...

106
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,260
Just...

107
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,780
She's normal.

108
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,060
Okay?

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,940
Okay.

110
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:31,860
Alright.

111
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,720
I'm gonna let her in.

112
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,700
She might be a little...

113
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,460
A little goofy.

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,420
She's also gonna descend from the sky.

115
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,880
As one does.

116
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,760
Oh...

117
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,420
Oh...

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,840
Oh...

119
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,800
You see chocolate?

120
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,080
I don't even know why I'm acting like it's...

121
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,540
You know...

122
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,500
Not just my actual outfit.

123
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,580
It's not just me.

124
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,400
No.

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm acting normally.

126
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,560
Like you can see me kinda...

127
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,900
Dancing.

128
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,940
YES.

129
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,280
YES.

130
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:33,300
I'm your maid And I descend from the heavens Look at my knees.

131
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm very bouncy, aren't I?

132
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,380
OK.

133
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,370
I'm bouncing in every part that matters.

134
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,390
My whole body.

135
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,810
I'm bouncing only where it matters, you guys.

136
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
My dress!

137
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,130
Obviously.

138
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,750
Obviously.

139
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:12,850
Obviously.

140
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,190
Obviously.

141
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,310
Oh my god, it's a Powerpuff Girl!

142
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,970
I kind of do feel like a Powerpuff Girl.

143
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,910
Jiggle pudding.

144
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,690
What was that one?

145
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,510
The Giga Pudding?

146
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,850
Gigi Pudding.

147
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,870
Wiggle jiggle, yellow middle.

148
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,490
That's the best of what you are.

149
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,950
I love you, mint.

150
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,690
White and tender.

151
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,690
Surround the center.

152
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,210
Cozy sitting in your crackling shell.

153
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,570
I love you.

154
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,590
Oh, Pudding Pudding.

155
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,730
Pudding, Pudding, Pudding.

156
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,210
I can't remember.

157
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,170
Oh my goodness.

158
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,250
Actually, I can zoom in.

159
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,990
Okay, I'm just gonna show you guys.

160
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,090
Like I said, this is just the most...

161
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,530
This is the reveal of all time.

162
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,710
It's the reveal of all time.

163
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,470
The most reveal you've ever seen.

164
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,850
A reveal that you will remember.

165
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,310
Probably.

166
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,570
A reveal.

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,980
Fang?

168
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,820
I've always had a Fang.

169
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,860
Why are you guys so surprised about the Fang?

170
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
I've always had a Fang.

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,140
Jiggle pudding.

172
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,240
There we go.

173
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,260
That's a little bit better.

174
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm here to serve you as your brand new mid.

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,260
We're happy about the Fang, not surprised.

176
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,720
I've always had a Fang.

177
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Since day one.

178
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
Big face mint.

179
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,680
Is this big enough for you?

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
Big face.

181
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,160
You want the big face?

182
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,080
I'll give you the big face.

183
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,300
Nice.

184
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,740
A little bigger.

185
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,280
So you guys like my TV model?

186
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,380
It's pretty cute.

187
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,880
It has so many toggles.

188
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
I have so many things to show you.

189
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,740
Which are quite fun I think.

190
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,060
Your claiming.

191
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,460
That was close.

192
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,820
Thank you for the Akasupa!

193
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,200
Thank you!

194
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
No nose.

195
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:55,860
Simba!

196
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,260
Thank you for the Akasupa!

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Got your nose.

198
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,920
Yeah, I actually don't have a nose here.

199
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,620
No nose.

200
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,620
Who knows?

201
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,640
But for real, I do have a nose sometimes.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,300
I mean all the time.

203
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,780
Wait, what are you talking about?

204
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,520
Why did you say sometimes?

205
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
I said all the time.

206
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,540
I have a nose all the time.

207
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,560
Why did you say sometimes?

208
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,040
Why did you say that?

209
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,920
You know what?

210
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,420
Actually...

211
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,800
I have a nose all the time.

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,960
You can't say that I don't have a nose.

213
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,380
It's just really petite.

214
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,140
Okay?

215
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
It's just really petite.

216
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,280
And I'm small.

217
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,160
And so it's dainty.

218
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,040
It's a nose that everybody knows.

219
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,980
That everybody strives to have.

220
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,670
Actually, you know what?

221
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,070
Also...

222
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,550
When you say that I don't have a nose...

223
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,870
Actually, I mean...

224
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,690
When you say that I don't have a nose...

225
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,890
What was I made for?

226
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,650
How does that Billie Eilish song go?

227
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,510
From Barbie.

228
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,090
What was I made for?

229
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,310
Cause I...

230
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,530
Cause I...

231
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,370
I have a nose.

232
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,570
This is you guys before stream.

233
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,770
She hates us!

234
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,710
She hates us!

235
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,910
She hates us!

236
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,610
She hates us!

237
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,770
She hates us!

238
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,330
What does a ghost need a nose for?

239
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,010
To smell you, my dear.

240
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,670
What am I?

241
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,710
The big bad wolf?

242
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,430
What is...

243
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,010
My... Oh, grandma.

244
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,170
Why do you have a nose?

245
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,510
Oh, to smell you, my dear.

246
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,970
To smell you, my dear.

247
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,590
To smell you, my dear.

248
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,470
You guys are waiting...

249
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,250
While you're waiting for me to start.

250
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,190
This is also you guys.

251
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:31,610
Hold!

252
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,370
Hold!

253
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,810
I'm ready to cry!

254
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,310
Hold!

255
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,790
When is she gonna start?

256
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,310
Is she gonna start on top?

257
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,730
Oh no, I don't think she's gonna do it.

258
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,610
I don't think she's gonna...

259
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,030
Ah!

260
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,270
Ah!

261
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,380
Oh wait, she needs five more minutes.

262
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,320
Hold!

263
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,300
I feel attacked.

264
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:10,980
You should.

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,440
PN.

266
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
This is my PN.

267
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,200
She is mocking us.

268
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,580
No, no, no, no, no, no.

269
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,820
No, no, no, no, no.

270
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,010
Don't leave because I'm gonna be doing some karaoke.

271
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,010
You guys won't leave the stream just because you've seen the chibi model, right?

272
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,990
You'll stay because you wanna listen to karaoke.

273
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,550
Right?

274
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,890
My eyes are so wobbly.

275
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,090
She's one second late.

276
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,630
Come to me.

277
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,730
Let's see.

278
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,330
I like when you're late.

279
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,750
The intro song is catchy.

280
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,790
You like my intro song?

281
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,410
Armin has no nose.

282
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,610
How does she smell?

283
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,430
Now, menti.

284
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,410
Do you have a tongue?

285
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,270
Oh wait, I think I do.

286
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,430
I thought I did.

287
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,890
Oh wait, no, I'm thinking of something else.

288
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,370
Thinking of something else.

289
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,930
Chibi Minto is not the only thing.

290
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,210
Well, the only thing today.

291
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,350
The only thing today.

292
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,910
But no, I don't think I have a nose.

293
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,530
No, I mean, a tongue.

294
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,370
That's just because I've been saying no's too much.

295
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,330
You guys have infiltrated my brain.

296
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,430
Obviously.

297
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,210
Let's see what else I have.

298
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,290
Oh, I have this as well.

299
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,010
I'm gonna scoot over a little bit for this.

300
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,030
Where... I don't know what to use this for.

301
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,950
But you can write stuff here.

302
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,850
What is Minto saying?

303
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,870
I'm saying something.

304
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,770
What is Minto saying?

305
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,050
Minto saying... Hold on, hold on, hold on.

306
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:25,990
Wait, hold on.

307
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,870
What is Minto saying?

308
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,230
Oh no, Minto is angry and saying... she's got words to say.

309
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:33,810
Snaricon.

310
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,950
If I say snaricon...

311
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,050
Oh, snaricon.

312
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,570
I love snike.

313
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,210
I love snike.

314
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,730
I have a nose.

315
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,720
Ghost fact.

316
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,820
You eat nine ghosts a year while sleeping.

317
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,500
Is that true?

318
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,360
A ghost fact.

319
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,700
I'm speaking facts.

320
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,940
I'm speaking facts.

321
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm speaking facts.

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,620
So maybe...

323
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,700
Maybe someday when I'm like doing a... like a yapping stream, I can put the topics of the stream in my little head.

324
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,620
Or something.

325
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,960
DNA of the soul.

326
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,560
So true.

327
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,420
But how does it taste?

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,780
Cute little chibi Minto love the fang.

329
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,280
Thank you.

330
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,280
Bogo is minted.

331
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,600
Very cute, small, wobbly chibi Minto.

332
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,700
Thank you.

333
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
I am very bouncy, aren't I?

334
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,700
Here's another one of a favorite.

335
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,220
She's saying you MF-er.

336
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,460
Yeah, you, you, you, you, you.

337
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,780
No.

338
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,280
My mouth is always wobbly.

339
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,200
I don't... I'm stuck on this puzzle.

340
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,800
I don't know what to do.

341
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,300
Actually, I have other stuff for when I'm stuck on a puzzle.

342
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,160
Actually, I have some expressions that I'm going to say for last that are my favorite.

343
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,280
But this one...

344
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,080
Ah.

345
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,470
Duh.

346
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,530
There's even more.

347
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:35,990
Oh my gosh.

348
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,970
There's so much.

349
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,570
There is so much.

350
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,730
There's like 30 expressions.

351
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,310
I'm not even kidding you.

352
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,770
There's like about 30 toggles.

353
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,370
So maybe I should get through this so that I can sing karaoke.

354
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,290
Oh my gosh.

355
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,550
I forgot an important thing.

356
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,990
Because I was playing Doom.

357
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,610
Hold on.

358
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,310
Hold on.

359
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,170
I'm going to just... I'm just going to kind of makeshift it.

360
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,890
I'm just going to kind of makeshift it.

361
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,370
Hold on.

362
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:10,870
Here we go.

363
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,970
I'll save this for later but...

364
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:20,950
Okay.

365
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,670
Sorry.

366
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,490
Like I said, this is the most makeshift...

367
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,830
This is the most makeshift outfit...

368
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,050
It's not an outfit reveal.

369
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,490
It's the most makeshift reveal you've ever seen.

370
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,010
What else was I going to do?

371
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,270
Oh.

372
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,950
I was going to...

373
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,250
Okay.

374
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,990
I'll save this one.

375
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,290
You guys seem to like dead eyes.

376
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,490
This is me when I become small.

377
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,050
I become small.

378
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,970
I'm too small.

379
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,270
I'm too small.

380
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,730
This and an OL outfit.

381
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,210
You guys are such freaks.

382
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,390
This is me when I see how freaky...

383
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,630
You call me freak phantom.

384
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,710
You guys are the freak phantoms.

385
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,670
I believe.

386
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:19,970
Maybe.

387
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,530
When she sings cat song.

388
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,070
True.

389
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,930
But also...

390
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,130
I can be excited.

391
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,490
I can be so excited.

392
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,030
And...

393
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,470
Yeah.

394
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:32,930
Woohoo.

395
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,270
Yippee.

396
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,550
Yeah.

397
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,510
Yahoo.

398
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,610
Woo.

399
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:41,730
Look

400
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,760
at you guys.

401
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,960
You're so excited in the chat too.

402
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,680
Yeah.

403
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,840
But...

404
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,660
Also...

405
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,380
You guys...

406
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,140
You asked for what?

407
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,820
I'm just a baby.

408
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,970
Don't ask me to be responsible.

409
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,810
I'm just a baby.

410
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,530
Oh, I'm die.

411
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,330
Thank you forever.

412
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,270
Thank you forever.

413
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:14,550
Ah!

414
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,110
Don't...

415
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,360
Wobobobobo.

416
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,220
Me playing...

417
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,280
That Outer Wilds DLC.

418
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,080
Wobobobobobo.

419
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Thank you.

420
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,240
Like it a lot.

421
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,170
Thank you.

422
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,970
In fact...

423
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,390
Thank you.

424
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,150
Do you guys like it?

425
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,630
Do you guys like...

426
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,450
My...

427
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,290
Chibi model?

428
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,270
Hm?

429
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,750
Does it hit?

430
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,110
Does it suit?

431
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,550
Does it satisfy you?

432
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,230
Does it meet your satisfaction?

433
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,630
It's too cute!

434
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,010
Can you frog blink?

435
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,700
So many cute expressions!

436
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,520
I know, right?

437
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,880
Try it!

438
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,380
Yeah, yeah, frog blink.

439
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh wait, actually I have the perfect thing for frog blinking.

440
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,920
Here, here, here.

441
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,920
My brain went puzzle.

442
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,620
Huh?

443
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't get it.

444
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,980
I might be stupid.

445
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,960
Oh no.

446
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Head empty.

447
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,400
My head is very...

448
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,500
empty.

449
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,700
When you...

450
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,240
When I...

451
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,340
When...

452
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,160
You're very jiggly for once.

453
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,200
What do you mean by that?

454
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,530
I'm wiggly?

455
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,090
I'm jiggly?

456
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,450
Yeah.

457
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,530
Let's see, what else do I have?

458
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,030
Oh!

459
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:21,890
This one?

460
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,770
Yeah!

461
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,950
Oh my gosh, me when I saw those...

462
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,910
When I see any Metal Gear merchandise, some...

463
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,250
My idol!

464
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,130
My Yoshi!

465
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,690
She just winked at me!

466
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,630
My Yoshi just winked at me.

467
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,650
This is heaven.

468
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,530
Maybe.

469
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,030
Don't tell our usual cute maid, but this maid is especially cute.

470
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,730
Your secret's safe with me.

471
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:01,990
But!

472
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,230
Also...

473
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,270
Wait, I forgot something.

474
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,870
Hold on!

475
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,280
I can...

476
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
I can also...

477
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,300
You guys are doing the heart emotes, right?

478
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,540
Me too!

479
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,180
Yeah, I'm gonna back up a little bit so you can see my body.

480
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,260
You can see me wiggle from side to side.

481
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,280
Yay!

482
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,480
This is when I'm delivering you all the moi moi energy!

483
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,560
Oishiku nare!

484
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
Moi moi!

485
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,340
Wait, hold on.

486
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,300
Redo.

487
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
Oishiku nare!

488
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,820
Moi moi!

489
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,080
Kyuuun!

490
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,720
Yeah.

491
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,740
Or...

492
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,680
Or...

493
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:07,940
Or...

494
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,420
Oishiku nare!

495
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,440
Moi moi!

496
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,020
Kyuuun.

497
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,310
You haven't been watching someone other than Minto recently, right?

498
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,750
Even the hearts are glitching out a little bit.

499
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,400
Right?

500
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:41,990
No...

501
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,510
There's someone other than Minto?

502
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,090
Exactly.

503
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,650
There's no one else.

504
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,230
There's no one else.

505
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,330
Minto has a knife.

506
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,310
Just Minto.

507
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,530
It's not plastic.

508
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,390
It's real.

509
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,090
Why would it be plastic?

510
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,450
It's real.

511
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,550
It's a real real real real real real real real knife.

512
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,810
Does the ace come back out?

513
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,390
Only watch Mint and Doki.

514
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,750
You know what, that's fine too.

515
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:29,970
That's fine too.

516
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,170
Okay, I'll put it away.

517
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,970
You guys like my knife?

518
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,190
What do you have there?

519
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,630
A knife!

520
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,710
No!

521
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,450
Just a ghost and her knife, you guys.

522
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,670
Oh my gosh, it's dangerously close to my eyes.

523
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,750
Will you cut our food for us?

524
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,230
Yes!

525
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,170
Of course!

526
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,470
That's why I have it, of course.

527
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,130
That's why I have it.

528
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,310
To cut your food.

529
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:08,990
Because you're little babies and you don't eat your steak unless it's cut into little tiny cubes.

530
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,130
With the assistance of me.

531
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,130
Obviously.

532
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,670
Let's see, what else do I have?

533
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,210
I have this one.

534
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,850
I'm not quite sure when to use this one.

535
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,500
Wasn't that the best story ever?

536
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,840
Actual Ikinari Steak.

537
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,560
So true.

538
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,720
Wasn't that the best story ever?

539
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:02,380
Isn't that the best story ever?

540
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,580
Anyway...

541
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,020
I've heard better.

542
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,360
Okay.

543
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,720
Name every better story.

544
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
AFK Toggles.

545
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,680
Oh, that's so true.

546
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,960
When I have gone fishing?

547
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,160
That's what you'll see.

548
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,340
Gone fishing.

549
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Gone fishing.

550
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,040
Let's see what else I have.

551
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,980
Oh, of course!

552
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,560
I must have this for when everything is awesome!

553
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,060
Wow!

554
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,500
So many features!

555
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,140
Minto's cute little model is so cute!

556
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,960
She's so jiggly and wiggly and bouncy and fluffy and everything.

557
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,840
And she's so fun!

558
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,780
Oh my gosh!

559
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,320
It's just like having a new Vtuber!

560
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm so excited!

561
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,820
Wow!

562
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,360
Yeah!

563
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,500
Wow!

564
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,080
Squishy and new!

565
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,620
Oh my gosh!

566
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,920
So shiny!

567
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,160
It's like I've fallen in love all over again!

568
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm gonna subscribe!

569
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,980
Hendrick, thanks for the...

570
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,040
Oh my gosh!

571
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,760
20 gifts!

572
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,840
Thank you!

573
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,800
Cowabunga!

574
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,720
Yeah, so this is what I'm really, really excited about.

575
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,380
Something!

576
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,660
It could be anything!

577
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,980
And let's see...

578
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,000
We have this one.

579
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:54,890
Shocking!

580
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,950
Big news!

581
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,210
Minto new model!

582
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,670
I mean, it's the same as her old model!

583
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,270
Just small!

584
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,750
She's so small!

585
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,950
She's like a little baby!

586
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,190
She looks like a marketable plushie!

587
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,530
Not yet!

588
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,150
Did you just...

589
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,230
Oh my god!

590
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,290
Eyeball boy, did you just gift one membership?

591
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,690
Thank you!

592
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,650
Thank you!

593
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,650
Let's see...

594
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,630
Gosh, there's so many that it's hard to...

595
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,670
It's hard to...

596
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,330
I showed you this one...

597
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,390
Yeah...

598
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,490
Oh, and then this one...

599
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,850
I think you guys will really appreciate this one.

600
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,730
It's quite subtle, so let me know if you see it.

601
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,190
Because...

602
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,930
You know...

603
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,590
You know...

604
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,650
Working as a maid is a...

605
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,210
It's a whole lot of work.

606
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,070
It's a whole lot of work, you know?

607
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,010
It's a...

608
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,190
Mint Vantovar...

609
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:15,830
The...

610
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,090
Yeah, but you know...

611
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,410
It's honest work.

612
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,090
And it's not so bad.

613
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,870
It's just, you know, I could use a little...

614
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,470
I could just...

615
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,270
I could...

616
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,950
Let me just take a...

617
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,250
Let me just take a nap here, okay?

618
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,830
Are you still here?

619
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,860
Break's over?

620
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,780
Oh, yes.

621
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,620
Thank you.

622
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,080
I got my 20-second break in for the day.

623
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,120
Thank you.

624
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,300
Back to my 12-hour shift.

625
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,140
All right.

626
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,880
Yeah.

627
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,100
But it's okay.

628
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,980
You know why it's okay.

629
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,320
You know why it's okay?

630
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,280
Because when I work...

631
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,380
I make all that money, baby!

632
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,190
I'm...

633
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,490
I'm a hard worker for that cha-ching, cha-ching.

634
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,970
Cash, money, money, money, money!

635
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,590
Yeah!

636
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,030
Cheapy, tired Minto is my two-spirit animal.

637
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,070
I think...

638
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,830
Should I be concerned or...

639
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,270
Wow!

640
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,950
A gold coin!

641
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,230
Money!

642
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,450
Money!

643
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:47,910
Money!

644
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,610
This is me when I go gambling in Vegas, everybody!

645
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,830
This is all my eyes can see.

646
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,850
All I can see is the dollar signs.

647
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,990
All in, baby!

648
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,970
All in!

649
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:00,970
I got a fortune!

650
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,190
Vegas!

651
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,490
Vegas!

652
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,210
Vegas!

653
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,090
Vegas!

654
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,610
Vegas!

655
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,590
Gambling!

656
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,350
Gambling!

657
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,010
This is me!

658
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,010
Deal or no deal!

659
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,490
Loads of money!

660
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,890
See you, thanks for the bar!

661
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,790
Gifted!

662
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,490
Yeah!

663
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,850
Here come the money...

664
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,570
Let's see...

665
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,950
So I showed you basically almost all the expressions.

666
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:35,690
I have just two left or three left that I kind of want to save because they're my favorite.

667
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:46,070
But also, when we're just kind of chilling here, sometimes at maid cafes, you can also buy your maid a drink to drink with you.

668
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,710
So, well, you guys have already donated, so thank you for the drink.

669
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,030
Nothing like a cup of joe on a Sunday morning reading the paper.

670
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,910
Still a little hot.

671
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,710
Yeah, this is super comfy, isn't it?

672
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,790
It's pretty comfy.

673
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,190
Tired eyes plus coffee.

674
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,160
Oh, guys, it ain't easy being cheesy.

675
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,700
Oh, I'll tell you that.

676
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,900
You need a cigarette.

677
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,260
Stop!

678
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,020
Mondays, am I right?

679
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,860
Back to the daily grind.

680
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,980
But, you know.

681
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,800
Oh, money.

682
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,320
Tired money.

683
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,680
Oh, my God!

684
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,650
I hope I said your name right.

685
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,650
Thanks for the gift!

686
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,990
Thank you!

687
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,780
Yay!

688
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,380
So, yeah, I can hold a cup.

689
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,540
I can hold... I showed you the heart.

690
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,860
Oh, let me zoom out a little.

691
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,360
Yeah, it's very cute.

692
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,700
Thank you!

693
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,520
Thanks for all the donations and the gift and membership so far.

694
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,100
Thank you!

695
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,620
Good Minto morning!

696
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,780
Yeah!

697
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,760
The cup is literally me.

698
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Good Minto morning!

699
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,460
And then I also have my knife.

700
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,880
But I also have, for later, when we do karaoke...

701
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,720
Ta-da!

702
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,150
Yeah!

703
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,370
And they match me.

704
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,610
They match my hair clip and my eyes and my ribbon.

705
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,710
But if you see me in concert, please use mint.

706
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,390
Yeah, please use mint, but I thought these colors also match me.

707
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,090
And you can see them pretty well, so...

708
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,710
Do Oshinoko baby dance.

709
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,890
Am I doing it?

710
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,070
Is it working?

711
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
But also...

712
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,920
If you're holding two pen lights, how did you make that clapping sound?

713
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
With my cheeks!

714
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,100
Duh!

715
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,920
And then...

716
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,500
If I'm playing a game, and I'm just like...

717
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,400
Okay...

718
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,680
I don't know what to do...

719
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,520
I can be like...

720
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,400
Hum hum...

721
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,940
Hum hum...

722
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,540
Actually, I'm taking your order right now.

723
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,560
What would you like?

724
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,640
What would you like?

725
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,920
What would you like?

726
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,220
What would you like to order?

727
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,820
Have you decided what to order?

728
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,000
Burger!

729
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,940
That's the house favorite.

730
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,780
Cheese!

731
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,660
Anything else?

732
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,940
Omurice, please.

733
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,360
Omurice.

734
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,600
Extra salt.

735
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,180
Anything else?

736
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,520
Omurice, please.

737
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,640
I'm hungry!

738
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,520
Pizza!

739
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,060
Two number 9s.

740
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,280
Number 9, large.

741
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,020
Number 6.

742
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,900
Number...

743
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,160
Number...

744
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,780
No, extra dip.

745
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,640
Extra dip.

746
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,540
Number 7.

747
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,820
Okay.

748
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
Number 7.

749
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,100
Two number...

750
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,620
45.

751
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:04,860
45.

752
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,760
One with cheese.

753
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,820
Oh, only one with cheese.

754
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,880
And a large soda.

755
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,900
Okay.

756
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,160
Okay.

757
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:10,800
Okay.

758
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,460
Okay.

759
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,860
Can you repeat that?

760
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,140
I didn't write anything.

761
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,100
Instead, I drew a picture of a dog.

762
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,420
So, yeah.

763
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,400
I can make lots of lists now.

764
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,700
And lots of notes.

765
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,880
Your new model looks like one of those ice cream truck popsicles.

766
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,780
Except my face is not melting, right?

767
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,080
Okay.

768
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,760
Oh yeah.

769
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,020
And checky please.

770
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,760
Thank you for the pink!

771
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,840
Thank you!

772
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,400
Thank you!

773
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,700
Thank you!

774
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,060
Thank you!

775
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,920
So...

776
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,140
Oh!

777
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:45,940
Um...

778
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:46,980
Um...

779
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,420
Also...

780
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,360
Um...

781
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,480
When you're being bad...

782
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,180
I'm gonna call your mom.

783
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:55,960
Hello?

784
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,870
Actually, this is me checking Twitter.

785
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,430
Oh, hold on, I need a...

786
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,990
I need something...

787
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,350
This is...

788
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:06,390
What's this?

789
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,710
This is me, um, checking...

790
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,730
Oh, oh, oh.

791
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,830
Oh, oh, hold on, one second.

792
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,090
This is me checking Twitter.

793
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,910
Why did you post that?

794
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,670
Why did you post that?

795
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,350
Oh, it's so bad.

796
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,070
That's such a bad take.

797
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,590
Why?

798
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,030
Why did you post that here?

799
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,990
Oh my god.

800
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,570
Mobile games...

801
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,030
This is when Arona gives me only one gold.

802
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,070
Or one...

803
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,850
One two-star in a poll.

804
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,190
Thank you, Arona.

805
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,870
I love you.

806
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,950
Thank you.

807
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,530
Thank you so much.

808
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,260
Don't tell mom I'm watching Mint instead of studying.

809
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,540
What?

810
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,980
Mom!

811
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,440
Mom!

812
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:06,700
Mom!

813
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,340
They're not...

814
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,060
They're watching VTubers instead of studying.

815
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,000
Get angry with the phone?

816
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,060
Get angry!

817
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,720
Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!

818
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,540
Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!

819
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,240
Everything about that is terrible!

820
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,480
Everything about this is terrible.

821
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,660
Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible.

822
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,380
I'm angry because I spent so much money...

823
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,300
in Gacha.

824
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,340
Not really.

825
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:42,900
Just kidding.

826
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:42,940
Just kidding.

827
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,380
But also...

828
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,440
Let's see...

829
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:46,740
Um...

830
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,680
Um...

831
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,880
Um...

832
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,500
We can do...

833
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,300
Oh!

834
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,160
This is the best poll ever!

835
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,280
I got three 3-stars!

836
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,640
Yippee!

837
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,180
Three SSRs!

838
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:01,920
Yeah!

839
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,380
But Mint, is it terrible?

840
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,320
Not anymore!

841
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,440
Looking cute, guys.

842
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,260
Thank you.

843
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,320
Thank you.

844
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,980
Me when I say capybara.

845
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,400
Yes!

846
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,360
Good job!

847
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,520
Satisfied.

848
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,260
But this one sent me enough.

849
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,440
Of course.

850
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,760
Oh, there you are!

851
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,200
Let me show you...

852
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,320
Your sword again.

853
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,920
I'm just gonna...

854
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,240
So clean...

855
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,980
The door is that way, Master.

856
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,460
Master.

857
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,040
The exit is that way.

858
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,060
The exit is that way, Master.

859
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,570
You didn't think you were going to leave without paying, did you?

860
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,230
For my moe moe service?

861
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,910
This is literally occupation.

862
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,490
I'll keep a maid ward.

863
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,890
I'll keep a maid ward here.

864
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,010
A last half-life 3?

865
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,350
Yes.

866
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,690
Being a maid is serious business, everybody.

867
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,490
Serious, serious business.

868
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,550
So yeah.

869
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,390
I have my crowbar.

870
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,170
Gordon Freeman.

871
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,690
And we have...

872
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,070
This is when...

873
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,350
Trying to riz you up a little bit.

874
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,700
M'lady.

875
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,780
Would you accept this rose?

876
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,200
That's only a fraction of...

877
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,560
As beautiful as...

878
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,080
You are.

879
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,260
Hold on.

880
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,780
Hold that on.

881
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,760
M'lady.

882
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,520
A rose for you.

883
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,900
It is only a fraction...

884
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,060
Of your beauty.

885
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
And your scent.

886
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Do you accept?

887
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,400
My humble rose for you?

888
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,400
M'lady.

889
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,520
I'm going to throw up.

890
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,100
I'm going to throw up.

891
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,820
M'lady.

892
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,480
M'lady.

893
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,280
Please take my rose.

894
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,300
Please.

895
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,460
I feel like I'm on The Bachelorette right now.

896
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,240
Please.

897
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,560
Please.

898
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,040
Please.

899
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,340
It's only a fraction of your smell.

900
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:53,800
I mean.

901
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,140
Wait.

902
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:54,620
A fraction.

903
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,480
A beauty.

904
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,980
A beauty of your smell.

905
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,180
Hold on.

906
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,760
Gosh.

907
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,100
Wait.

908
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,500
Hold on.

909
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm going to get this right.

910
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,500
It's only...

911
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,220
Your beauty is smelly.

912
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:05,960
Wait.

913
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,300
No.

914
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,580
No.

915
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,300
That's not right.

916
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,640
You are...

917
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,040
You have a rose scent.

918
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,560
Oh gosh.

919
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,880
You guys.

920
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,360
I'm throwing.

921
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:14,940
I'm throwing.

922
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,460
I'm throwing.

923
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,720
Oh gosh.

924
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,780
Please.

925
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,360
Please.

926
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,480
Take my rose.

927
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,720
Are you a part of Team Rocket?

928
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,020
Team Rocket.

929
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,440
Blasting off again.

930
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:37,720
Blasting off again.

931
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,250
Anyway.

932
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,130
Anyway.

933
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:57,450
Anyway.

934
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,370
So.

935
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,690
When it is time for you to eat at the maid cafe.

936
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:03,810
Ta-da.

937
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:05,990
Just kidding.

938
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,070
It's my turn to eat.

939
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,290
It's my...

940
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,010
Mom said it's my turn to eat the omurice.

941
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,730
Less threatening knives.

942
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:22,970
See.

943
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:24,690
Yeah.

944
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,110
We have...

945
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,310
You're a...

946
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,410
Knife?

947
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,070
Serious knife.

948
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,330
Be afraid of this knife.

949
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,750
Thank you.

950
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:34,730
You're...

951
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,630
A soup.

952
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,810
Babu Minto.

953
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,590
We have this one.

954
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,210
Right?

955
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,690
And then fork and knife.

956
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,070
Very innocent.

957
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,830
Very round.

958
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:47,650
Sharp.

959
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:49,530
Round.

960
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,270
Sharp.

961
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,090
Round.

962
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:53,210
Round.

963
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,450
I dub thy...

964
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,690
Why am I a monto?

965
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,390
Don't eat me?

966
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,230
Oh.

967
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,430
Rice.

968
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:01,710
Nah.

969
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,310
I'm just gonna pretend I didn't read that.

970
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,660
Okay.

971
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,400
Anyway.

972
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,100
I'm putting the fork and knife away now.

973
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,300
You know what?

974
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,060
I'm gonna eat something that doesn't require a fork and knife.

975
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:18,660
At all.

976
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,720
Watermelon.

977
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,520
Yeah!

978
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:22,640
Yeah!

979
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,180
Because it's summertime, Watermelon is the perfect summer snack.

980
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,240
Am I right?

981
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,040
Am I right?

982
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,820
Am I right?

983
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,680
Am I right?

984
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,540
Am I right?

985
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,380
Am I right?

986
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,880
When will I ever use this?

987
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,340
Probably like the two times a year I eat watermelon.

988
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,380
It can also be used as a telephone.

989
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,120
Hello?

990
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:44,800
Ding!

991
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:47,720
Hello?

992
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:51,720
Hello?

993
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,080
Hello?

994
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,040
Aw man.

995
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,260
It's about my watermelon's extended warranty.

996
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,180
Aw man.

997
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,260
It's about my watermelon's extended warranty.

998
00:46:59,260 --> 00:46:59,860
Hang up.

999
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:01,920
Okay.

1000
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,860
The last two expressions that I have that I wanna show you guys that are pretty silly.

1001
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,200
They're mine and my favorites though.

1002
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,300
Are we ready?

1003
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,940
Are we ready?

1004
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,880
Oh my god.

1005
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,100
I just realized I've been streaming this whole time without a noise key.

1006
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:24,620
Sorry.

1007
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,060
My bad.

1008
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,080
If you heard anything.

1009
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,480
Like me scooting around in my chair.

1010
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,240
Okay.

1011
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:30,800
Ready?

1012
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,500
The first one.

1013
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,240
Good.

1014
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:38,940
Oh.

1015
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,300
Oh.

1016
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,540
Oh.

1017
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,830
The most cursed part about it is I can't close my eyes.

1018
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,190
Even when I close my eyes they're never fully shut.

1019
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,380
I'm looking at you.

1020
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,550
Minto Vegas sphere.

1021
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,170
But then also.

1022
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:31,690
Don't worry.

1023
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,510
It gets even more dumb.

1024
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:36,770
It gets even more dumb.

1025
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,730
Minto...

1026
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,230
Minto doesn't get it.

1027
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,320
Minto...

1028
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,720
Minto...

1029
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,740
Huh?

1030
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,540
Huh?

1031
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,140
Huh?

1032
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,020
Huh?

1033
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,680
Oh.

1034
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:09,740
Oh.

1035
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,020
Just a box.

1036
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,140
I don't get it.

1037
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,020
I just don't...

1038
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,560
Thanks for the two months.

1039
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,300
Bye.

1040
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,760
So these are my favorites.

1041
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,660
Because they're so silly.

1042
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,640
But also.

1043
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,760
But also.

1044
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,820
There's one other that I can do.

1045
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,580
This one.

1046
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,440
I think this one is where when I really mess up.

1047
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,580
This one.

1048
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,320
I'm sorry.

1049
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,200
It's not... I didn't... I... It's not my fault.

1050
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,140
It's... It's... It's... It's the government's fault.

1051
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,560
You know?

1052
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:31,600
I think.

1053
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,400
Mint sweat collected.

1054
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,520
Don't do that!

1055
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
Those eyes could turn you into a perfect ice cream.

1056
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,100
You're right!

1057
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,320
Could just chew you right up.

1058
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,080
Don't eat me!

1059
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,480
Don't eat me!

1060
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,210
I might have chocolate themed full ghost.

1061
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,910
And I might be named mint but I'm not edible.

1062
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:03,410
Probably.

1063
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:04,270
I think so.

1064
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:09,950
Anyway.

1065
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:13,730
So yeah.

1066
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,390
Are you guys ready for some karaoke?

1067
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,810
What do you guys think?

1068
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,750
What do you guys think?

1069
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,710
Or do you think so?

1070
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,610
What do you think?

1071
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,010
Do you like?

1072
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,390
Do you like?

1073
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,730
Do you like?

1074
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,650
10 out of 10!

1075
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:30,930
Yippee!

1076
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:33,590
Yippee!

1077
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,130
Cute!

1078
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:37,650
Cute!

1079
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:38,210
Cute!

1080
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:38,830
Very cute!

1081
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,410
Yippee!

1082
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:41,870
Thank you!

1083
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:42,190
Thank you!

1084
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:44,150
Remember

1085
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,700
the basics of CQC, Chibi Minto.

1086
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,440
I got you.

1087
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,680
I just need a gun too.

1088
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,380
But I at least have a knife.

1089
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,920
Moe out of 10.

1090
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,360
Yippee!

1091
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,480
You need to give us a few months of mint.

1092
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,240
Wait.

1093
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,620
You need to give us a few months of mint as cute perms for this.

1094
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,120
Gun is OSP.

1095
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,960
Oh, you're right.

1096
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,060
You're right.

1097
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,460
You're right.

1098
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:19,780
You're right.

1099
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,300
Do you have a cellist?

1100
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,940
I don't!

1101
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,200
I was so unprepared for everything here.

1102
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,840
Thanks for making me laugh.

1103
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,100
Thank you!

1104
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,440
What should I sing, you guys?

1105
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,920
I need a microphone.

1106
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,980
Do I have a microphone?

1107
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,240
Oh, I do.

1108
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,400
Kind of.

1109
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,180
Hold on.

1110
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,750
It's kind of funky looking, but that's okay.

1111
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,010
Don't worry about it.

1112
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,290
When you see it.

1113
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,670
Oh, whoopee.

1114
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:07,990
There we go.

1115
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:09,670
Nice.

1116
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:11,590
Hamtaro!

1117
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:12,830
Okay!

1118
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,410
We'll sing a Hamtaro!

1119
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,670
Hamtaro!

1120
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,210
Thank...

1121
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:24,250
Hamtaro...

1122
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:24,870
Thank you for the pink!

1123
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,550
I loved all the different expressions.

1124
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,270
Oh.

1125
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,150
Oh.

1126
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,910
I can't wait to see you do some...

1127
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:30,510
Thank you!

1128
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:31,870
Thank you...

1129
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:33,950
Let's see.

1130
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,990
Hamtaro...

1131
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:39,870
Okay!

1132
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,030
Okay, time for karaoke.

1133
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,690
I hope Ace Combat karaoke one day.

1134
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:50,250
What kind of songs are in Ace Combat besides... well, the only one I know is...

1135
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,490
Everyone get in a circle.

1136
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,070
Yeah.

1137
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:58,810
Everybody get in a circle.

1138
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:01,750
Okay.

1139
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,790
Let me test the audio.

1140
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,170
Let me test

1141
00:54:52,430 --> 00:55:00,670
the audio.

1142
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,380
Yay!

1143
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:38,680
Actually, since I have now completed showing off the model, I'm going to put up my advertisements.

1144
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,700
Kenny-san!

1145
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,200
Thank you for the birthday gift!

1146
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:44,800
Thank you!

1147
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,520
I'll be honest.

1148
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,800
I don't know that song very well.

1149
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,520
But it's been requested before.

1150
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,740
I don't know about his vocal music.

1151
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,080
I'll look for you to play them.

1152
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:03,500
Don't worry.

1153
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,160
Thank you, Nan!

1154
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,160
I'll look into... well, I will play them and then I will learn them.

1155
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:11,820
Hashtag add.

1156
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,600
Hashtag boomer.

1157
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,200
Funky Monkey Babies.

1158
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,160
Funky Monkey Babies.

1159
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,180
It's been a while.

1160
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:26,920
Oh gosh.

1161
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:27,860
I'll try.

1162
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,620
I'll do my best.

1163
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,660
I think the...

1164
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,680
It might be a little low for me, but let me try.

1165
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,820
Let me see.

1166
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,040
Let me see if I can try it.

1167
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,700
Let me see if I can do it.

1168
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,800
Freaky Meido Babies.

1169
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,240
That sounds weird though.

1170
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,220
Don't say it like...

1171
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,420
Actually, don't say it like that.

1172
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,000
Snow Halation?

1173
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,000
Okay, I can do Snow Halation too.

1174
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,620
Here, I'll make a list.

1175
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,160
Next Snow Halation after Funky Monkey Babies.

1176
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,640
I'm going to do my best to rap.

1177
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,200
Ah!

1178
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:08,730
Ah!

1179
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,330
Oh, sorry.

1180
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,010
I messed up.

1181
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:11,870
I pressed the wrong thing.

1182
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,410
I meant to press the reverb and I accidentally pressed Snow Halation.

1183
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,070
To-do-ke-te!

1184
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:21,250
I accidentally pressed mute instead of... instead of reverb.

1185
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,930
We are still small.

1186
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,270
In the palm of my hand...

1187
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,530
In this palm of my hand...

1188
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,410
There's nothing.

1189
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,310
It's raining and the wind is blowing.

1190
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,590
But I won't give up.

1191
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,830
But I don't want to give up.

1192
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,690
I'm sure that someday...

1193
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,600
We are still small.

1194
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,900
In the palm of my hand...

1195
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,860
In this palm of my hand...

1196
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,920
There's nothing.

1197
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,740
It's raining and the wind is blowing.

1198
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,980
But I won't give up.

1199
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,640
I'm sure that someday...

1200
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,440
Where did it go?

1201
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,260
I wonder...

1202
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:48,180
Where has it gone?

1203
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,820
I wonder...

1204
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:50,860
Stop...

1205
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,260
Why do I have a flash?

1206
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,460
A

1207
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:03,500
little pause... and we are back.

1208
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,160
I'm a small selfish.

1209
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:25,860
I'm a small selfish.

1210
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:18,190
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

1211
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,550
I didn't let it finish.

1212
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:20,270
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

1213
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:20,270
I didn't let it finish.

1214
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:20,810
I'm so sorry!

1215
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:22,910
Shiny days?

1216
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:23,350
Okay.

1217
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:25,750
Shiny days!

1218
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:30,810
Yes, yes.

1219
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,930
Love the new model, it's so bouncy!

1220
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,250
It is, it is, it is.

1221
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,150
Rude me, though.

1222
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:36,750
I'm sorry!

1223
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,150
I'm sorry.

1224
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:40,290
Okay.

1225
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:43,430
I'm not just only taking requests, though.

1226
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:45,890
So maybe don't spam them or anything.

1227
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:47,390
Speedyfire, thanks for the vibe!

1228
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,850
Gifted!

1229
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:48,630
Thank you, thank you.

1230
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,490
Oh, my glow sticks!

1231
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:50,030
You're so right!

1232
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,650
I'm not quite used to the toggles yet, so I can't remember everything.

1233
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,670
The more I use it, the more I'll get used to it.

1234
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:03,430
So maybe just be a little patient for now with that.

1235
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:05,630
If you're just like, gosh, she's not using any of her expressions!

1236
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:06,290
It's hard.

1237
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,510
It's hard!

1238
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:09,990
Anyway.

1239
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,000
Isn't this like the opposite of a summer song?

1240
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,020
Isn't this like the opposite of a summer song?

1241
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,060
Isn't this like the opposite of a summer song?

1242
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:31,340
Isn't this like the opposite of a summer song?

1243
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:31,960
It's not like that.

1244
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,900
You can make it feel like it just came down from the skies.

1245
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,300
Ta-da!

1246
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:38,920
Ta-da!

1247
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:47,080
A special season's color Makes you feel so excited.

1248
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:57,560
When we first met, there was this ordeal in my mind.

1249
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:37,770
A little pause...

1250
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:37,770
and we are back.

1251
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,510
A little pause...

1252
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:30,510
and we are back.

1253
01:05:30,970 --> 01:06:00,950
A little pause... and we are back.

1254
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:37,590
A little

1255
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:55,540
pause...

1256
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:55,940
and we are back.

1257
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,340
If only I could change the lighting on these ones... to orange.

1258
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,440
And we'll let that one finish.

1259
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:33,600
Yay!

1260
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,140
Um... um...

1261
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,120
Shiny days.

1262
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,020
I wonder if there's a karaoke about on here.

1263
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,080
Oh, there is!

1264
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:49,680
Nice, nice, nice!

1265
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,080
Okay.

1266
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:50,940
No guide.

1267
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,120
To the other side of the light.

1268
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,320
Right now.

1269
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,440
The first step to the beginning.

1270
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:51,960
Ready?

1271
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,040
Shiny days.

1272
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,840
A new wind.

1273
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,180
I'll step on it.

1274
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,600
Go my way.

1275
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:02,740
Can you feel?

1276
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:03,420
The sky is clear.

1277
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:09,460
A brand new world.

1278
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,560
Brought to you by the excitement.

1279
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,940
Listen to the melody.

1280
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,960
To the distant whispers.

1281
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,120
If you let it resound.

1282
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,860
Let's fly to the future.

1283
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,370
Look,

1284
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,560
if you look up.

1285
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,980
The sky is full of clouds.

1286
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,200
So happy.

1287
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,520
Let's breathe in the air.

1288
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,000
A small, natural miracle.

1289
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,220
One by one.

1290
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:44,740
Straight.

1291
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,440
I'm grasping it.

1292
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,260
A little courage is the trigger.

1293
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,280
The world starts to move.

1294
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,180
All right.

1295
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,320
I can go anywhere.

1296
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,740
Ready?

1297
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,900
Shiny days.

1298
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,080
Go my way.

1299
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,720
Say your favorite song.

1300
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,480
Feels so good.

1301
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,320
Feels so good.

1302
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,620
Can you see?

1303
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,580
The sky is clear.

1304
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,260
Take to heaven.

1305
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,480
The wind carries us together.

1306
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,340
A brand new mind.

1307
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,840
Please save your memories.

1308
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,060
Let's overlap.

1309
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,260
With your dreams.

1310
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,660
Let's take a step to the future.

1311
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,080
With a

1312
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,610
smile like the sun.

1313
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:44,950
Take it easy.

1314
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:57,430
Let's relax our shoulders and spend every day Today and tomorrow, so it will be fine

1315
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:13,350
Sing a song, let's sing together To the other side of the clear sky Can you see the glittering heaven?

1316
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:32,950
The wind is inviting us to everywhere Shiny days, a new wind I step on the steps that seem to flutter and go my way Can you feel the sky that is transparent?

1317
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:52,310
A brand-new world that is carried by a whirlwind Listen to the melody, to the faraway place If you make it sound to yourself Let's fly to the future Doo-doo-doo Bye!

1318
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,100
Shiny days!

1319
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,440
Maybe I'll do...

1320
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,420
Hold on...

1321
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,860
Maybe I'll do...

1322
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:19,800
Maybe I'll do a few more songs?

1323
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,780
I don't know what to sing!

1324
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,600
Thanks for the claps!

1325
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1326
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,240
Hmmm...

1327
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,480
What to sing, what to sing?

1328
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,120
I kneel...

1329
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,560
Stop!

1330
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:33,540
Why?

1331
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:34,960
Why, why?

1332
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,700
New romantic sailors?

1333
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:50,460
New romantic sailors, sailors Since we are camping, do you know a laid-back journey?

1334

I can do that one too Stay with me Good choices everybody Let me see if I can find a karaoke of...

1341
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:46,120
Hacking, Hacking to the Hate Hacking to the Hate This should work, let me make sure You sing like an ass

1342
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:54,540
It's been a long time since I've sung this song, so I'll do my best It's been a while

1343
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,500
Please keep your eyes on it Uhhh...

1344
01:13:59,280 --> 01:13:59,640
Uhhh...

1345
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,800
Wait, actually, sorry I just realized Let me do this one instead Because I don't want to get...

1346
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,680
I don't want it being...

1347
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:06,980
Um...

1348
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,140
Taken off of...

1349
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:15,440
YouTube Hold on, I just have to check it OK, this is like a karaoke version Not like official karaoke You know what I mean?

1350
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,080
I realize...

1351
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:17,400
I think...

1352
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,120
You guys...

1353
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,900
I think for karaoke streams from now on...

1354
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,580
I don't...

1355
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,600
Oh, Jessie, thanks for the...

1356
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:23,940
Thanks for the gifted I'm so excited!

1357
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:24,540
Thank you so much!

1358
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:32,720
For karaoke streams in the future, I might start doing them in shorts style because...

1359
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:41,080
Actually, I didn't realize this, but shorts style... I don't know if it's shorts style streams, but at least shorts themselves are kind of...

1360
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,780
They have their own rules when it comes to... when it comes to... what's the word?

1361
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,180
Music?

1362
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:57,700
And so, if I upload a music short, it says I can still keep it up and it's exempt from being blocked and stuff.

1363
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,200
So, shorts are different with music copyright.

1364
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,000
So I'm gonna test it as well with the shorts stream.

1365
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:12,440
So maybe, maybe if we start doing the shorts stream, we can get around that.

1366
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,340
Maybe, maybe.

1367
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,760
So I'll try doing it.

1368
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:24,200
So if you're wondering like, wow, I saw like so many other Vtubers doing it as shorts streams and I know that it's like...

1369
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,520
I guess quote-unquote better for the algorithm too.

1370
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,320
But maybe that's also why they do it.

1371
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:32,920
I don't know.

1372
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,620
I don't know.

1373
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,080
But yeah, I'll sing Hacking to the Gate now.

1374
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,200
Oh!

1375
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:37,860
Oh my gosh.

1376
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,000
Did you hear her?

1377
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:39,500
Hold on.

1378
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:40,940
I'll turn... Oh!

1379
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,060
Pies!

1380
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,120
Come here.

1381
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,640
Stop scratching my tear.

1382
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,740
Could you hear her?

1383
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,400
Could you hear her going...

1384
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,280
Come here.

1385
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,620
I didn't realize you were in here.

1386
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,900
You silly girl.

1387
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,280
Silly baby.

1388
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:56,960
Come here.

1389
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:57,500
Come here.

1390
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:58,560
Come out.

1391
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,400
Come here, pies!

1392
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,440
Did you hear that?

1393
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,080
That pathetic, pathetic sad meow.

1394
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,400
What are you... What?

1395
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,000
What are you rolling on your back for, you silly girl?

1396
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,460
She's so sweet.

1397
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,360
Cute.

1398
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,120
Pies!

1399
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,180
You can hear her, right?

1400
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:20,920
Yeah.

1401
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,400
Yeah.

1402
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,960
Oh, just an update.

1403
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,320
I guess on Butaro as well.

1404
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:29,000
Ever since I've started the medicine for him, he has been doing so well.

1405
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,880
He's responding to it so well.

1406
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:37,020
He has been eating consistently.

1407
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,060
He hasn't thrown up even once.

1408
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,620
He's been doing really, really, really good.

1409
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,620
He only goes under the bed a little bit.

1410
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:48,140
But for the most part, he's been like super-duper, I think, feeling better.

1411
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,580
And he's been more active.

1412
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,840
He's been playing more with pies again.

1413
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,360
So, I'm really happy.

1414
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:54,560
So, yeah.

1415
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,560
I think, you know, I'm not going to get my hopes up too much.

1416
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,680
Just in case.

1417
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,700
But I think things are good.

1418
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,200
It was like almost immediate too that he...

1419
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,960
It's so funny because every time I take him to the vet...

1420
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:13,180
Every time I take him to the vet, the veterinarian is always just like, He is like the best cat.

1421
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,340
I've ever worked with.

1422
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,540
He's so sweet.

1423
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,740
He's so kind.

1424
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,040
He's so great.

1425
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,180
That's good.

1426
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,100
Thank you.

1427
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:30,000
But when I had to go take him to get to the vet last time...

1428
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,980
Because they had to do an ultrasound on him to test his...

1429
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,880
To see if there was anything, you know.

1430
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:36,260
Which, you know, they did find.

1431
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,800
But they did find some stuff in his tummy.

1432
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:39,940
But...

1433
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,300
When I...

1434
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:46,800
But they told me that I couldn't feed him the night before or the morning of.

1435
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,460
And you have to keep in mind, before the medicine, he was already eating so little.

1436
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:55,300
And so I had to take him to the vet and he was so hungry.

1437
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,900
And then they told me not to pick him up until like after 4 p.m.

1438
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,580
And so it was really late.

1439
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:05,260
And I was like, well, surely they might have given him like a little bit of a snack or something.

1440
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,540
But they didn't give him anything.

1441
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,720
He hadn't eaten the night before or all day.

1442
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,500
So the poor guy was starving.

1443
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:12,940
And then when...

1444
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:16,300
When I went to pick him up, they were like...

1445
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,380
Mint, he was a little spicy with us.

1446
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,940
He got hangry and he bit them.

1447
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,200
He tried to attack them.

1448
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:27,120
It's the first time he's ever, ever, ever...

1449
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,160
My vet called my cat an unholy terror.

1450
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,040
Yeah, every time I take him, they're like, he's such an angel.

1451
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,020
He's so sweet.

1452
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,600
Except this time, he was hangry.

1453
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,520
And he...

1454
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,740
He went after them.

1455
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,680
Okay, let me let...

1456
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,660
Oh, my goodness.

1457
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,880
Let me let pause out real quick.

1458
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,370
Let's sing Hacking to the Gate.

1459
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:06,130
For reals this time.

1460
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:07,970
For real.

1461
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,500
For reals this time.

1462
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:01,100
For reals this time.

1463
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,200
Okay, let's see...disappear.

1464
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:04,220
For reals this time.

1465
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:05,040
What good was

1466
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:35,020
A little pause... and we are back.

1467
01:20:57,330 --> 01:21:07,050
A little pause... and we are back.

1468
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:34,570
A little pause... and we are back.

1469
01:21:51,350 --> 01:22:10,770
A little pause... and we are back.

1470
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,320
I really like this fire.

1471
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,820
This maid is so cool, son of a bitch!

1472
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:19,800
Nice.

1473
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:27,910
Nice too.

1474
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:30,430
Actually there's a song before I do New Romantic Sailors.

1475
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:32,410
I forgot to sing it last time.

1476
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,730
That someone requested Touhou.

1477
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:39,150
And I have a Touhou song that I would like to sing.

1478
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:40,470
One second.

1479
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,730
One second.

1480
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:44,430
I can grab it.

1481
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,170
Actually, let me make sure that I can sing this.

1482
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:01,090
Yes!

1483
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:09,930
Yes!

1484
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:11,250
Okie dokie.

1485
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:11,670
Cool.

1486
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:12,450
I do have it.

1487
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:13,830
I was like, wait a second.

1488
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:14,850
I thought it was here.

1489
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:15,990
I do have it.

1490
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:16,350
I do have it.

1491
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:16,730
I do have it.

1492
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:19,150
Stop.

1493
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:29,930
I don't think I can even... I don't even think I can sing that one.

1494
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:32,990
Oh my gosh.

1495
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:34,870
Begin!

1496
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,500
I know you love singing Mary on a Cross, but are there any other ghost songs you like?

1497
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,620
If you have any recommendations, I would love to know them.

1498
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,900
Nico Nico Douga!

1499
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,180
Maybe I can finish off with that.

1500
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:50,220
Nico Nico Medley.

1501
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,340
We'll finish it off with that.

1502
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,620
I'll do New Romantic Sailors.

1503
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:57,620
I'll do this Touhou song.

1504
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,900
The New Romantic Sailors.

1505
01:24:58,940 --> 01:24:59,760
Then Stay With Me.

1506
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:00,880
And then...

1507
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:00,980
Oh!

1508
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,300
Wata-shi no kare wa pa- You know.

1509
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:04,440
Ok.

1510
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,320
Wata-shi no kare wa pilot.

1511
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,560
And then finish it with a Nico Nico medley.

1512
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:14,900
Okokok.

1513
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,700
This is from Touhou.

1514
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,220
Last word!

1515
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:55,810
静寂に沈みゆく 浅き夢の腰 何かを失くしても それに気づけぬ愚かさ 閉ざされた記憶には 霧がかかったようで 永遠の自由は 孤独を嫌う誰かはいた A little pause... and we are back.

1516
01:26:55,830 --> 01:27:12,150
A little

1517
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:30,570
pause...

1518
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:34,410
and we are back.

1519
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:55,450
I can't see your smile, I pretend I can't see your smile I realize the truth, I'm still searching for it For the sake of just one person, I risk everything What is a good love?

1520
01:27:56,550 --> 01:28:38,950
If I could bring back the time when I sacrificed everything I had If I could bring back the time when I sacrificed everything I had I wouldn't be able to be honest An eternal regret Tonight again, the red moon floats in the sky I gently close my eyes The tears I've hidden The words I've lost My breath trembles I just want love I love this part!

1521
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:46,220
This is for Renemillia-sama!

1522
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,580
I wish I could be her maid, too.

1523
01:28:50,460 --> 01:29:03,600
We meet, we confirm, we connect A miracle, we think of each other's dreams Like a foggy morning mist I'm looking for a nostalgic sound

1524
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:28,320
Seeking for salvation I stretch out my fingertips The warmth I felt I remember the heat The screaming voice Overflows in the air The words I've lost

1525
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:04,780
That was Yubisaki no Netsu from Touhou Last Word.

1526
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:07,380
Yubisaki no Netsu.

1527
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,700
Alright, next song.

1528
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,860
Next song, next song, next song.

1529
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,360
Next song, next song, next song.

1530
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,540
I'm glad you guys like the...

1531
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,240
Like the Chibu Minto.

1532
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,740
Ojo-sama love!

1533
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,260
I know.

1534
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,200
Praying for help me, Erin.

1535
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,240
Erin, Erin.

1536
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:31,980
Tashikete Erin!

1537
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,740
Watashi no otsuki-sama.

1538
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,640
Sakasamo no otsuki-sama.

1539
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:42,360
Tashikete Erin!

1540
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,140
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1541
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,220
Maybe next time.

1542
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,000
Maybe I should do a Touhou dedicated stream.

1543
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:49,880
That would be kind of fun.

1544
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,120
As long as I could get...

1545
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,980
As long as I could get the karaoke for them, right?

1546
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,640
Erin, Erin.

1547
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:58,180
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.

1548
01:30:58,340 --> 01:30:59,220
Is it JP only?

1549
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,880
Somehow it became JP only songs today.

1550
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:05,600
Somehow.

1551
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:08,040
Somehow it became JP only songs today.

1552
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,700
But that's okay.

1553
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:10,840
That's a-okay.

1554
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,620
I do have some stuff I gotta do.

1555
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,300
I'll do later, so...

1556
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,120
Um...

1557
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,220
So, we...

1558
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:19,440
I'll just do the songs that I have written down to do.

1559
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:20,800
And then, um...

1560
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,240
You know.

1561
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,340
I can always do it karaoke.

1562
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,440
Another day.

1563
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,000
Another day.

1564
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:25,780
Another day.

1565
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:26,500
Another day.

1566
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:27,760
New

1567
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,060
Romantic Sailors.

1568
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,000
Sailors.

1569
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,120
New Romantic Sailors.

1570
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,120

1577
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,360
There are many different worlds out there.

1578
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,520
And some are just that invisible wall.

1579
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,840

1597
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,310
A little

1598
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:11,920
pause...

1599
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,600
and we are back.

1600
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:24,020

01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:29,830
little pause... and we are back.

New Romantic Sailors.

1606
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:40,750
Sailors.

1607

Neo-romantic Sailors.

1608
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:43,810

Yeah!

1610
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:08,570
Pre-recorded where?

1611
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:09,950
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha...

01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,830
Oh, Neo-romantic Sailors.

Sailors.

1614
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:21,090
This song is always so hype!

1615
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:26,450
Could work for your voice.

1616
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:27,050
I don't know either.

1617
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:38,070
Who did those beautiful backings?

1618
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:43,630
Pre-recorded scum.

1619
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:48,190

真夜中のドア...

1652
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:16,490
Stay with me.

1653
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,190
Alright, two more songs!

1654
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:20,110
Actually, that's perfect.

1655
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:21,770
Because then I end on ten songs.

1656
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:22,710
Right?

1657
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,610

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1669
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:41,630
Michael Jackson song?

1670
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:44,310
Maybe next time, maybe next time.

1671
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:47,530
I think next karaoke maybe I will do like 80s...

1672
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:50,550
Karaoke...

1673
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:51,850
Maybe.

1674
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:54,590
English 80s and maybe Japanese 80s too.

1675
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:55,150
Who knows?

1676
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:59,330
But I'm not taking requests anymore.

1677
01:42:59,510 --> 01:42:59,950
Thank you though!

1678
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:03,170
Thank you, thank you for wanting me to sing stuff.

1679
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:06,750
私の彼は...

1680
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:07,890
I actually really like this song.

1681
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:10,990
舞の音...

1682
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:14,170
Let me make sure this one works.

1683
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:18,010
Let me make sure this one works.

1684
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,080
Okay, it does.

1685
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,620
I think it's good enough at least.

1686
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:29,500
Okay.

1687
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,500
Here we go!

1688
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:55,100
キュンキュン キュンキュン 私の彼は 舞の音 Oh, I'm sorry, I can't read the...

1689
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,460
Thank you!

1690
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,640
Sorry, hold on.

1691
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:58,660
I can't read it!

1692
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,220
I can't read it!

1693
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:04,660
Hold on, let me pull up other lyrics with the footy gun or something.

1694
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:05,740
Um...

1695
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:08,840
私の彼は...

1696
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:10,820
舞の音...

1697
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:12,160
I'm so sorry.

1698
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:13,680
リードゥ...

1699
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,160
リードゥ...

1700
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,500
My Yoshi is illiterate!

1701
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,760
I don't think I've ever sung this one on stream before.

1702
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:38,040
キュンキュン キュンキュン 私の彼は...

1703
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:38,140
キュンキュン キュンキュン 私の彼は...

1704
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:40,220
舞の音...

1705
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:47,960
キラリ光ってキュコボカ 音は私の融合症

1706
01:44:51,880 --> 01:45:10,500
長く大きく飛行機雲で 大きなハートが 重ねて二つ 青い大空 ラブサイン I love the sky I love you, you love me

1707
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:27,020
だけど彼ったら私より 自分の飛行機にお熱なの キュンキュン キュンキュン 私の彼は...

1708
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,740
舞の音...

1709
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:35,130
Thank you!

1710
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:38,130
Thank you so much!

1711
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:39,110
Thank

1712
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:42,940
you!

1713
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:48,400
キュンキュン キュンキュン 私の彼は...

1714
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,040
舞の音...

1715
01:45:52,860 --> 01:46:12,280
今日も一人で空の上 いつも私を見上げてる ポーカリー浮かんだ 綿雲目指し 優しくそっと 去られて欲しい 彼と...

1716
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,980
一緒に...

1717
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:20,420
なぶひこう I love you, you love me

1718
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:36,280
だけど彼ったら私より 自分の飛行機にお熱なの キュンキュン キュンキュン 私の彼は...

1719
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:38,680
舞の音...

1720
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:48,660
私の彼は...

1721
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,280
私の彼は...

1722
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:54,580
パイロット 私の彼は...

1723
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:58,000
Well, guys, I really hope that you liked my scuffed karaoke.

1724
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,960
And my TV model.

1725
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,600
And...

1726
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,560
Yeah, I'll use it.

1727
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,280
I'll use it.

1728
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,460
Yeah, I'll use it.

1729
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:14,860
So...

1730
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:14,940
So...

1731
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,100
Okay.

1732
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:20,060
Last thing.

1733
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:26,000
Last song.

1734
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:28,840
Thanks for the no-no or summertime.

1735
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:32,300
Thank you for saying the same with me.

1736
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:32,940
Thank you, Chizoro.

1737
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:33,400
Sorry.

1738
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,880
I was late on...

1739
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:36,080
On...

1740
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:37,140
On saying that.

1741
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:38,420
Oh, wait.

1742
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:39,900
I think that one hasn't popped up yet.

1743
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:41,200
I'm just some guy with a mustache.

1744
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:41,580
Thank you.

1745
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,940
It's everything I wanted and more.

1746
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:44,600
Just half the size but twice the fun.

1747
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:47,480
The main scientist did well with this one.

1748
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,340
It is really cute.

1749
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:50,980
Yay!

1750
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:52,860
This song is actually quite long.

1751
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,540
So it is quite the finale.

1752
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:55,760
I've never...

1753
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,480
I don't think I've ever sung it as a karaoke before.

1754
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,440
So I'm gonna do my best.

1755
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,480
And...

1756
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:03,180
Yeah.

1757
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,840
But this is the Niko Niko...

1758
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,740
Niko Niko Douga Kumi Kyoku.

1759
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,240
So it's a...

1760
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,640
It's a big old medley of a bunch of old-timey...

1761
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:13,280
Old-timey...

1762
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,080
Old...

1763
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:15,120
Older...

1764
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:15,700
Old...

1765
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:16,540
Not that old.

1766
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:17,300
Um...

1767
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:17,460
It's a...

1768
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:17,780
Anyway.

1769
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:18,480
Um...

1770
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,200
This is the one, right?

1771
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:19,920
Hold on.

1772
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:21,040
Let me make sure I have the right one.

1773
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,020
Actually, let me check the...

1774
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:24,460
Oh, gosh.

1775
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:26,380
It's kinda crunchy.

1776
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:32,590
I think it's kinda...

1777
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:32,690
Wait.

1778
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:33,690
Maybe this one's not as crunchy.

1779
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:36,270
I think so.

1780
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:36,970
I think it's okay.

1781
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:37,310
Hold on.

1782
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:37,730
I'll check it.

1783
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:38,930
Boomer!

1784
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:39,590
Shut up!

1785
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,890
I don't wanna hear that from you.

1786
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:46,990
I can draw a straight line from me hearing Kumi Kyoku for the first time to this point right now.

1787
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:49,870
Niko Niko Douga Love!

1788
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:50,530
Niko Niko Douga Love!

1789
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:50,850
Oh, yes!

1790
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:52,350
Okay.

1791
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:53,510
Alright.

1792
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:55,110
Here we go.

1793
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:55,770
Oh, gosh.

1794
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:57,930
There will be scuff but that's okay.

1795
01:48:59,150 --> 01:48:59,870
That's okay.

1796
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:00,650
I'll do my best.

1797
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:02,650
…

1798
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:24,550
… … … … … … … … …

1799
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:12,750
It's so easy.

1800
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:14,390
You like this kind of thing,

1801
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:22,140
don't you?

1802
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,440
Don't tell

1803
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:52,630
me yamari yamari yaiya yamari yamari yamari yaiya The two of us look

1804
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:01,700
straight ahead and go straight ahead.

1805
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:11,190
It's

1806
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:34,090
like a full-fledged trade.

1807
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:36,550
All

1808
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:50,950
you do is follow these paths and tenders of your gaming love.

1809
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:09,710
All you do is follow these paths and tenders of your gaming love.

1810
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:14,710
No matter who you are, no matter who your allies are, you can't stop

1811
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,760
this indescribable wave of your heart.

1812
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:30,740
Wait, where's the lyrics?

1813
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:31,520
The lyrics are all over the place.

1814
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:32,680
The lyrics are all over the place.

1815
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:40,770
The lyrics?

1816
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:42,950
If you can see my screen right now, it's so crazy.

1817
01:52:43,670 --> 01:52:46,830
The soul that can be seen through the eyes of the wise.

1818
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:48,330
The soul that can be seen through the eyes of the wise.

1819
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:50,510
Aim for the future wherever you are.

1820
01:53:20,570 --> 01:53:22,110
I ran away because it was so bright.

1821
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:23,990
I'm always weak.

1822
01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:27,230
From that day on, I haven't changed.

1823
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:29,930
Even if I did, I haven't changed.

1824
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:32,010
I haven't said anything.

1825
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:35,030
I'm so frustrated that I'm talking to my fingers.

1826
01:53:39,610 --> 01:53:41,490
Where are you now?

1827
01:53:41,790 --> 01:53:43,750
What are you doing?

1828
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:48,210
Are you in the place where this sky continues to go?

1829
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:54,630
Will you smile at me as usual?

1830
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:59,990
Now I just keep wishing for that.

1831
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,850
I hate it.

1832
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:04,130
I hate it.

1833
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:07,970
Loving For whom?

1834
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:09,090
For whom?

1835
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:12,210
Can't be alive without you.

1836
01:54:12,370 --> 01:54:12,950
Why?

1837
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:15,390
Why is it so embarrassing?

1838
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:17,630
Why?

1839
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:18,030
Why?

1840
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:18,270
Why?

1841
01:54:18,270 --> 01:54:18,430
Why?

1842
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:19,850
Don't miss you.

1843
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:21,890
Love forever.

1844
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:24,550
I don't know.

1845
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:30,150
If I think about it, it will just fall apart.

1846
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:31,430
You and

1847
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:37,360
me.

1848
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,720
Take away.

1849
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:38,560
Kick around.

1850
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:39,060
Wait.

1851
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,010
Yeah.

1852
01:54:58,490 --> 01:55:00,450
I've done it when I was a child.

1853
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:01,630
Beautiful

1854
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:11,620
memories.

1855
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,080
When it's a curry or something.

1856
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:15,340
It's a good spoon.

1857
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:16,920
It suits me.

1858
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:18,240
Ultraman.

1859
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,500
Ultraman.

1860
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,740
But now.

1861
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,400
It's a mess.

1862
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,500
Forget about it.

1863
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:27,420
Like being chased by something.

1864
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,520
I'm living every day.

1865
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,980
The scenery is A black line.

1866
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,320
A black line.

1867
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:39,100
The lonely season is Graffiti.

1868
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:44,680
The courage you gave me is A black line.

1869
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:50,090
The lonely season is Dramatik.

1870
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:52,570
I'll follow you.

1871
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:54,010
What kind of pain?

1872
01:55:54,330 --> 01:55:55,990
In the darkness of the world.

1873
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,390
I'm sure.

1874
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:00,190
You are shining.

1875
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:01,390
So

1876
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:06,940
that my soul won't be broken.

1877
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:08,880
My way.

1878
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,960
It overlaps.

1879
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:11,140
Now.

1880
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:12,880
Let's go together.

1881
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:14,740
It

1882
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:19,700
should be mine.

1883
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,820
Because it's a zero book.

1884
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:24,660
Conclusion.

1885
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,260
It's Monday.

1886
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:29,300
But the mood is bad.

1887
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,680
What should I do?

1888
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:33,060
If I take off, it'll be good.

1889
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:34,860
It's cute.

1890
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,040
With all the people.

1891
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:40,820
Gacha gacha cute.

1892
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:41,520
Figure.

1893
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,140
After.

1894
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,660
With a more loud voice.

1895
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:47,320
Let's scream out together.

1896
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:50,560
Figure.

1897
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,300
I've always been a friend.

1898
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,240
Ten thousand years.

1899
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:55,500
And two thousand years ago.

1900
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:56,480
I love him.

1901
01:56:58,100 --> 01:56:59,560
Over 8,000 years.

1902
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,900
I've missed you since I was a child.

1903
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:07,000
I love you even more than I have ever loved you.

1904
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,620
Since the day I met you, the music has been playing in my hell.

1905
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:15,160
Pe-tan!

1906
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:16,740
Un-to-ma-tsu Pe-tan!

1907
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:22,220
Min-nan-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Min-nan-nan-na-po-tsu Pe-tan!

1908
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:22,780
Pe-paa!

1909
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:25,920
Pe-tan!

1910
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:26,500
Pe-tan!

1911
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:27,440
Tsuru Pe-tan!

1912
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,400
Ya-ja!

1913
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,060
Ya-ja!

1914
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:29,960
Tsuru Pe-tan!

1915
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:39,340
Min-nan naisuki-na-ni Koi

1916
01:57:44,450 --> 01:57:45,750

1917

1918
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,660

1919
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:29,910
Aishii -no o-yo-wa-ai

1920
01:59:02,190 --> 01:59:05,310
You are the prince of ten-e!

1921
01:59:05,390 --> 01:59:07,730
Sugii-ni yomi-washo onmyo-ji-ra-ka!

1922
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:33,240

1923
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:43,770
Yay!

1924
01:59:44,150 --> 01:59:46,070
That was Kumikyoku!

1925
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:48,890
Somehow, a little bit, a little bit.

1926
01:59:49,550 --> 02:00:02,390
Obviously, if you've never heard, if you've never heard the real Kumikyoku, um... niko-niko-douga medley, niko-niko-douga medley, I recommend you listen to it because it's so much more epic than when I did it...

1927
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:03,150
Thank you, guys!

1928
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:06,510
See you guys tomorrow... if I see you tomorrow...

1929
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:08,930
If I don't, have a great rest of your... night.

1930
02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:10,590
Have a great rest of your week!

1931
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:13,150
Well, see me once this week, okay?

1932
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:16,230
You'd better not... you have to come see me once at least this week, okay?

1933
02:00:16,610 --> 02:00:16,830
...

1934
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:19,070
RayVac, thanks for the buy gift...

1935
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:21,450
Kitoto!

1936
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:23,130
Thank you for the super chat.

1937
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:23,670
Thank you!

1938
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:28,150
Thank you guys!

1939
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:30,770
I hope you liked the TV model!

1940
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:33,610
And I will see you... later!

1941
02:00:36,710 --> 02:00:43,210
I will one

1942
02:00:50,630 --> 02:00:52,550
day sing that as a revenge.

1943
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:56,190
What was happening was the lyrics that I was looking at...

1944
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:58,950
and then the lyrics that I was following along with were different.

1945
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:00,050
So it was tripping me up!

1946
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:01,710
I was getting...

1947
02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:03,250
I was getting...

1948
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:04,870
I was getting...

1949
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,990
I was getting tripped up.

1950
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,790
And then...

1951
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:17,170
Hold on, let me show you the part that I was just like...

1952
02:01:17,170 --> 02:01:18,350
If you could only see...

1953
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:19,690
I mean, the lyrics were...

1954
02:01:20,330 --> 02:01:21,570
were all the same...

1955
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:22,450
Well, no, they weren't the same.

1956
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:23,990
No, wait, hold on.

1957
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:25,130
I'm trying to find...

1958
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:25,810
Yeah, yeah.

1959
02:01:26,190 --> 02:01:27,210
This is what I was looking at...

1960
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:28,710
when I was just trying to figure out the...

1961
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:29,490
the dang...

1962
02:01:29,490 --> 02:01:31,210
I forgot something really important!

1963
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:34,010
I'm going back.

1964
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:37,530
I forgot something really important.

1965
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:39,270
I forgot the...

1966
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:40,130
You guys...

1967
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,530
Hey!

1968
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:41,170
Hey!

1969
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:41,470
Hey!

1970
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:42,510
You didn't leave yet!

1971
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:43,050
I

1972
02:01:51,330 --> 02:01:54,110
would like to thank the person...

1973
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:56,770
who drew and rigged my model.

1974
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,530
I would like to thank them.

1975
02:02:02,290 --> 02:02:03,390
This is the credit.

1976
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:04,210
Ta-da!

1977
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:06,810
Hexose!

1978
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:10,250
I hope that's how you pronounce it.

1979
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:14,090
Or AKA 0x4682B4.

1980
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:18,430
Thank you for drawing this...

1981
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:20,190
and rigging it as well.

1982
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:20,890
They did both.

1983
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:22,010
And also...

1984
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:22,910
When I...

1985
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:24,270
When I got it...

1986
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:25,830
When I got it commissioned...

1987
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:29,230
I didn't even ask for any of these toggles.

1988
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:30,530
Like literally...

1989
02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:31,930
Not a single one.

1990
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:32,690
Not a single one.

1991
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:34,670
They just did everything themselves.

1992
02:02:36,210 --> 02:02:36,650
So...

1993
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:37,650
Yes.

1994
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:39,250
Definitely go follow them...

1995
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:40,150
and support their work.

1996
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:41,510
They live on Mars.

1997
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:42,650
Yes!

1998
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:46,570
So...

1999
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:47,390
Thank you Hexose!

2000
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:48,450
Thank you!

2001
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:48,810
Thank you!

2002
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:49,170
Thank you!

2003
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:49,390
Thank you!

2004
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,650
Thank you!

2005
02:02:49,650 --> 02:02:49,870
Thank you!

2006
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:50,090
Thank you!

2007
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:50,270
Thank you!

2008
02:02:50,330 --> 02:02:50,390
Thank you!

2009
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,510
Thank you!

2010
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:50,810
Thank you!

2011
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:51,030
Thank you!

2012
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:51,550
Thank you!

2013
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:53,070
Thank you!

2014
02:02:53,070 --> 02:02:53,550
I feel so cute!

2015
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:56,250
Okay, now get out of here.

2016
02:02:58,670 --> 02:02:59,490
Anyway, what was I saying?

2017
02:02:59,590 --> 02:02:59,710
Oh.

2018
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:00,690
Let me show you what was on my screen.

2019
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:11,750
Let me show you what was on my screen, when I was singing that part, why it was tripping me up so much.

2020
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:14,470
Look at this.

2021
02:03:14,610 --> 02:03:15,390
Look at this!

2022
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:18,830
What am I suppose to follow?

2023
02:03:23,380 --> 02:03:23,700
Oh.

2024
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:30,780
This is just Niko Niko Doga medley thing, you know.

2025
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:32,720
One of the lines.

2026
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:35,540
Follow something, follow something.

2027
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:37,140
Anyway, okay.

2028
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,020
Thanks guys, thank you, I hope you liked the chibi model.

2029
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,600
See you guys later.

2030
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:43,680
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.
