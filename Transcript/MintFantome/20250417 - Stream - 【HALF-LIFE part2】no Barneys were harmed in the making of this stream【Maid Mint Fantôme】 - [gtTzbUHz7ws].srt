00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,790
Hello.

2
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,730
Hello.

3
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,170
Hello.

4
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,350
Hello.

5
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:32,730
Hello.

6
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,350
Yeah, I've got my crowbar.

7
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,730
It's so funny.

8
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,630
Actually, I googled... I googled... Oh my gosh.

9
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,930
Brian, thank you.

10
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,570
I don't know if I'm going to go yet or not.

11
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,010
I did see Stephanie being there at the Metal Gear concert in London is very tempting.

12
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,890
I'm not going to lie.

13
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,170
Since last time I went to the Metal Gear concert, it was Donna Burke and Cynthia Carell.

14
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,990
But if I could see Stephanie too.

15
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,430
Joostin.

16
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,290
Is that how you say it?

17
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:06,930
Joostin?

18
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,310
Like juicin?

19
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,310
Anyway, what was I saying?

20
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,930
Oh my gosh.

21
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,990
I got distracted because of Metal Gear.

22
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,850
Of course I did.

23
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,650
Oh, I googled... I googled crowbar PNG earlier.

24
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,550
And this came up and it was just like, this is the crowbar from Half-Life 2.

25
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,590
I was like, what?

26
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,070
Oh my gosh.

27
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,670
Joostin?

28
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,190
More like Joostin.

29
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:34,970
Oh, okay.

30
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,750
I thought so.

31
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,750
I was like, I don't think it's Joostin.

32
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,270
But it makes me want some juice.

33
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,030
It's a popular crowbar.

34
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,890
It must be.

35
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,630
My crowbar from the future.

36
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,490
Whoa, whoa.

37
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,430
Hold on.

39
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,110
I'm going to actually rearrange.

40
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,430
There we go.

41
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,650
That should be better.

42
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,430
That should be good.

43
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,570
Surface tension is my favorite part of the game.

44
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,050
If that is a reference, I don't get it.

45
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,490
Time paradox.

46
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,510
Anyway, welcome back to Half-Life.

47
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,650
Last time we were about to go into...

48
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,370
Another part of the map.

49
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,850
It's a chapter.

50
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:26,510
Oh, okay.

51
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,430
Yeah, we were just about to start another chapter.

52
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,550
My ass is heavy.

53
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,810
Is that another reference?

54
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,030
Why are you guys sending me references that I don't understand?

55
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,930
Why would you... I don't... I don't get it.

56
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,110
I don't get it.

57
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,710
Are these references?

58
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,590
I'm guessing.

59
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,850
I... I... I... I don't... I don't know.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,630
I... I'm... I'm assuming because I don't understand the context otherwise.

61
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,130
Happy Koharu Day.

62
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,830
Um...

63
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,250
I always treat Koharu very well.

64
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:09,730
Thank you.

65
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,480
You should watch videos with Half-Life sound effects dubbing memes.

66
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,480
Let me play the games first.

67
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,760
Let's... let me... let me get through the...

68
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,900
Oh, gosh.

69
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,720
Was this a mistake?

70
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,220
Everybody's now just saying memes and I don't get them.

71
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,060
And...

72
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,000
Why... why wasn't it... why was it normal before?

73
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,840
And now it's... now... now everybody's insufferable.

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,280
What's happening?

75
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,000
I feel like the first time I played it was fine.

76
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,960
Yeah, Half-Life Full-Life Consequences.

77
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
That's the only thing I understand.

78
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,360
Because that's the only video I've ever seen.

79
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,600
More like spend half of my life for the next day's combat.

80
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,550
Soon you will be part of the meme culture.

81
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,750
I feel like though, it's not...

82
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,250
Is it... isn't it most of Half-Life memes from like...

83
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,490
The... the videos people make?

84
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,750
Or am I... remembering that wrong?

85
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,530
Hmm...

86
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,010
Most... yeah, mostly.

87
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,250
So...

88
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,650
Yeah, I guess...

89
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,350
Well, I have to play the games first anyway.

90
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,430
I have to play the games first anyway.

91
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,110
So...

92
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,790
Wait, you are playing Half-Life for the first time?

93
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,890
Yes.

94
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,630
Yeah, I've never played it before.

95
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,530
99% of Half-Life memes are skippity-toilet.

96
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,210
We don't... we don't talk about those ones.

97
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,610
Actually, has...

98
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,890
I'm so curious though.

99
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,930
Has skippity-toilet been accepted by like the...

100
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,030
Half-Life...

101
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,550
Grandpas and Grandmas of the world.

102
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,570
Do they all say like...

103
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:10,810
You know what?

104
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,990
At least the kids are getting into the...

105
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,130
Getting into it.

106
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,550
No!

107
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,410
Also, Gumpul, happy birthday!

108
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,170
Can I ask for a...

109
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,290
What's a special birthday song?

110
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,430
What's a special one?

111
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,850
Hmm...

112
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,410
Um...

113
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,710
I could do in like Simlish.

114
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,630
Gapul-ibu...

115
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,590
Deed-o...

116
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,510
Gapul-ibu...

117
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,070
Deed-o...

118
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,650
Gapul...

119
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,710
Gapul...

120
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,810
Gapul-ibu...

121
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,210
Deed-o...

122
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,050
Woooo....

123
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,670
There you go.

124
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,370
Let's see.

125
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,830
All right.

126
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,570
Wait.

127
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:03,650
Where?

128
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,470
This must be it.

129
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:07,910
Wait.

130
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:08,530
Yeah.

131
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:17,430
I realized I ended the stream and then I like walked away from my computer and I came back and I never closed out of the game.

132
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,570
So grandpa is here for the... Yeah.

133
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,630
Yeah.

134
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,670
Yeah.

135
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,770
So.

136
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,790
Okay.

137
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,350
Load.

138
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,530
I think it was F6 for quicksave.

139
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,730
No?

140
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,430
All right.

141
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,650
Let's get back into it.

142
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,910
Let's get back into... Okay.

143
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,270
Hold on.

144
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,810
Hold on, sir.

145
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,970
I'm remembering how to use the controls.

146
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,470
Okay.

147
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,250
And then I select.

148
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,750
And then I select.

149
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,650
Double crowbar.

150
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,630
Do I just pick up things automatically?

151
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,230
Uh... Oh.

152
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,570
Oh!

153
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,110
Wait!

154
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:07,530
Wait!

155
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:07,790
Wait!

156
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,010
Wait!

157
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:08,770
Redo!

158
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,310
Undo!

159
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:09,610
Wait!

160
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,290
Hold on.

161
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,450
I just messed up.

162
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,070
We need to go that way, grandpa.

163
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,390
And then this is to heal my suit and this is to heal my... Wait.

164
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,030
This... Oh.

165
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,130
That's unfortunate.

166
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,330
That's unfortunate.

167
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,190
That's unfortunate as well.

168
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,150
You ready, grandpa?

169
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,570
Let's get my guns out.

170
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,630
Get your guns out.

171
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,890
Wait.

172
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,470
How do I... Oh, there we go.

173
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:36,870
Okay.

174
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,710
Grandpa?

175
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,330
You ready?

176
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,790
What was that?

177
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,070
Oh.

178
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,290
I'm gonna keep you safe, grandpa.

179
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:50,910
Oh, gosh.

180
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,990
Uh... I don't know what the blast pit is, but it sounds dangerous.

181
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,150
Oh.

182
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,550
Oh.

183
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,950
I think I need to blast this.

184
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,080
Oh.

185
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:04,720
Oh.

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,740
That doesn't sound good.

187
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,080
Grandpa?

188
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,880
Watch out.

189
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,760
Grandpa?

190
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,170
Uh...

191
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:17,590
This

192
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,220
is as far as I go.

193
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,440
Uh... I think you're gonna die in there.

194
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm

195
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:29,610
gonna...

196
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,510
I'm gonna blast it.

197
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:33,730
Uh-oh.

198
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,110
Grandpa!

199
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,290
Grandpa!

200
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,770
I think I need to reload.

201
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,390
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

202
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:52,460
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,360
Okay.

204
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:54,940
Come on.

205
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,540
Come on.

206
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,540
Come on, mister.

207
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,180
Let's go.

208
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:57,640
Yep.

209
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,160
Yeah.

210
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,780
Oh, wrong way.

211
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,300
This way.

212
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,940
Excuse me.

213
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,580
Sorry.

214
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,160
Excuse me.

215
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,660
Sorry.

216
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,300
Excuse me.

217
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,420
Oh, that's my flashlight.

218
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh, my God.

219
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,740
It scared me for a second.

220
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,360
Oh.

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,360
Uh...

222
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,820
This way.

223
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:09,820
Okay.

224
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,030
What is that sound?

225
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,260
I'm scared.

226
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,140
What is that?

227
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,500
Oh, the crowbar instead?

228
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,100
So true.

229
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,580
Something... Oh, something's totally in there, destroying everything.

230
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
Nah, yeah, don't worry about it.

231
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,040
I wonder if I can get him from here.

232
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,120
Okay, all right.

233
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Wait.

234
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,540
No, no, no, no.

235
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,240
Oh, I hear him.

236
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:09,940
Okay.

237
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,620
All right.

238
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,140
Oh, I see it.

239
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,620
I see it.

240
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,780
Where'd he go?

241
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,620
Wait.

242
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,860
I don't remember what gun is good.

243
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,770
You're safe!

244
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,100
You're safe!

245
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,980
He's really appreciative.

246
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,380
What's... What was spitting?

247
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh.

248
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,140
Whatever that is.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
I think I got it.

250
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,340
Oh, ouchy, ouch!

251
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,340
You son of a gun.

252
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,640
I got it.

253
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,440
Whatever it was.

254
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,540
Don't worry about it.

255
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,920
First try.

256
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,540
So true.

257
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:01,880
Ah!

258
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,720
First try.

259
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
So true.

260
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,820
Let's just... This is the shoddy, right?

261
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm going to stay here and wait for my colleagues.

262
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,000
I hear another one.

263
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,740
Oh my god!

264
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,560
Ah!

265
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, golly!

266
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,120
I hear something else though.

267
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,240
No?

268
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Danger.

269
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,920
Very cool.

270
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,380
Is that another crowbar?

271
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,680
In case you lose your old crowbar?

272
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,500
If you find Dr. Kummer, tell him I said, hello, Gordon.

273
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,840
I hear it.

274
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,620
Oh, wait.

275
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,360
I hear it though.

276
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,920
Fascinating.

277
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:56,860
Fascinating.

278
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,220
I never suspected such things could be.

279
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,380
Alright.

280
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,860
Let's go press the button, I suppose.

281
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,880
Pull the lever.

282
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,520
Do you what?

283
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,440
Do you...

284
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:10,960
Do you...

285
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,660
Wait.

286
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,340
Do not do...

287
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,720
Do a wheel?

288
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,540
It won't let me.

289
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't think so.

290
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,420
Sorry, I can't speak sometimes.

291
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,040
Let's ignore that for now.

292
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,700
And press this.

293
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,240
Oh, just kidding.

294
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,900
Let's go downstairs.

295
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,700
Oh, wait.

296
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,560
I did the thing.

297
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,360
It did work.

298
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,320
Oh, golly.

299
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,080
Oh, golly.

300
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,560
What's coming up?

301
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,460
Um...

302
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,700
Wouldn't you like to get one of these blood samples under a microscope?

303
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,800
Shut up, doctor.

304
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,220
We have important things.

305
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:58,640
Oh!

306
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,360
Ouch.

307
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,680
Is there anything else in here?

308
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,040
I guess not.

309
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,580
Okay.

310
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,500
Metal Gear has trained me for elevators.

311
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,460
I need to switch my gun.

312
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,520
To this one instead.

313
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,800
Oh, the recoil.

314
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,900
Oh, I'd...

315
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,400
Die.

316
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,160
Yeah.

317
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Where'd the other one go?

318
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,520
Oh, look.

319
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:42,940
A tram.

320
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,540
Yeah.

321
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:46,900
Oh.

322
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,060
Wonder what that could be for.

323
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,200
Oh, there he is.

324
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,620
Oh, there's two of them.

325
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,520
Three of them!

326
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,700
Four of them!

327
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,140
Wait!

328
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,880
No!

329
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,560
Oh, no.

330
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,540
Oh, my God.

331
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,040
There he is.

332
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,940
Come on, please.

333
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,100
Oh, my...

334
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,880
My ammo.

335
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,740
They're kind of cute.

336
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,740
They are pretty cute.

337
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm not going to lie.

338
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,580
I don't want to take the tram.

339
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:33,820
Okay.

340
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,120
You know what?

341
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,900
Let's just take the tram.

342
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,840
Let's give my little leggies a rest.

343
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,180
Wee!

344
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,020
Oh!

345
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,140
Wee!

346
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,450
Okay.

347
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,550
Full steam ahead!

348
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,130
Can I run into this thing?

349
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,790
Oh, God.

350
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,460
Oops.

351
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,980
Um...

352
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,060
Not anymore!

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh!

354
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,650
Something's going off.

355
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
Oh, gosh!

356
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,630
We're...

357
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:30,970
Oh.

358
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,790
Look at this guy.

359
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,770
He's like, If you don't see me...

360
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:39,890
Dang it.

361
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,910
Hold on.

362
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,650
Let's just use my pistol.

363
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,110
What is this?

364
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,010
Stop.

365
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,370
Stop.

366
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,170
Stop.

367
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:50,930
Stop.

368
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,270
Shut up.

369
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,620
Why are we saying rip?

370
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
Is the...

371
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,140
Headcrab more important to you?

372
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,600
Than my life?

373
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,800
He was a chill guy.

374
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,880
He was pretty chill.

375
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,660
I'm not going to lie.

376
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,240
Okay.

377
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,660
I'm trying to jump up here.

378
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,380
All right.

379
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,720
Oh.

380
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,760
Okay.

381
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,620
What's that look...

382
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:22,980
Oh.

383
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,820
Oh, my God!

384
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,920
Where did you come from?

385
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,540
I think I got him.

386
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,120
Go back on the train and forward.

387
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,480
Wait, what do you mean?

388
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,080
Really?

389
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,450
I think it's broken.

390
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,650
I think it's broken.

391
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,250
I don't think it's working anymore.

392
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,310
It's broke, broke.

393
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,370
And we gotta go this way.

394
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,450
Okay.

395
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,030
We're fine.

396
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,510
It's just radioactivity.

397
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,370
Nothing to be afraid of, probably.

398
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,570
Just Geiger sounds.

399
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,130
Just Geiger sounds.

400
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,210
Totally normal.

401
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,360
Why are things down here, anyway?

402
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,740
Why are things in here?

403
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,600
Okay.

404
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
We're going in the pipes.

405
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,900
Where?

406
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,940
Where?

407
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,640
Where did you come from?

408
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,180
Oh, my gosh.

409
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,480
Please.

410
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,420
Where did you come from?

411
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:40,780
Ah!

412
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,060
You son-of-a-gun.

413
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,260
Is black-haired minto called licorice?

414
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,120
No, I'm calling minto.

415
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,040
Wait, there's probably some stuff on here too, no?

416
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,270
Where are you?

417
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,190
Where'd he go?

418
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,150
Maybe he fell into the goop.

419
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,430
Is there anything over there, you think?

420
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,350
Nah, right?

421
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,670
Maybe?

422
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:21,510
But then why would there be boxes for me to, you know, jump on top of?

423
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,790
Oh, this is, this is pretty spooky.

424
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,410
I'm not gonna lie.

425
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,590
I don't think I like this.

426
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,770
Handy-dandy pistol.

427
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,340
I don't like these ones the most.

428
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,180
Maybe these guys suck.

429
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Ow!

430
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,640
Oops.

431
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,670
Got his ass.

432
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,670
Didn't get his ass.

433
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, didn't get his ass.

434
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,490
Reloading.

435
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,610
Killed him.

436
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,030
If I...

437
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,530
Oh, god.

438
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,130
I'm trapped in the pipe!

439
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,390
Wait, how do I actually get out?

440
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,430
How do I get out of the pipe?

441
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,150
Oh.

442
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,010
Just like that.

443
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,350
Someone suggested a grenade.

444
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:54,830
And you know what?

445
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,450
I think that's a grand idea.

446
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,710
Alley-oop!

447
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,550
Nice!

448
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,170
Do you think the bull squids are bad here?

449
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,410
Try the HD fan remake Black Mesa.

450
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,750
They're a nightmare.

451
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,210
Oh, yeah.

452
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,770
That's the thing that people were like, Why don't you play Black Mesa instead?

453
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,970
And I said, I don't know.

454
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,870
I want to play the original.

455
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,850
Actually, though, this has been really tickling like that.

456
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,770
Oh, no!

457
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,450
Oh, no!

458
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,010
Oh.

459
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,730
I'm okay.

460
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,710
I'm fine.

461
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,050
But this has been scratching that, uh...

462
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,230
Not the radioactive itch, But the, um...

463
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,810
Like the doom itch that I've kind of been having lately.

464
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,970
So...

465
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,570
I'm kind of happy about that.

466
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,530
Just, like, wanting to play like a...

467
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,270
Old...

468
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,310
FPS.

469
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,070
Kind of dealio.

470
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,350
High radiation area.

471
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,470
You don't say!

472
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,470
30% What's...

473
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,610
Power cold?

474
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,380
Yeah, like a boomer shooter.

475
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:01,960
Oh!

476
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,340
Oops!

477
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,720
My bad.

478
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,200
Sorry.

479
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,280
I accidentally right clicked.

480
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,040
You nasty creature, you.

481
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,700
Oh my gosh!

482
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,230
Let's see.

483
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,950
Where do we go from here?

484
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,650
What's in that?

485
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,270
What's that?

486
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,930
How about Quake?

487
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,390
Oh, yeah!

488
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,710
I do want to play Quake sometime.

489
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,910
Can I push this?

490
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,810
Look, there's something...

491
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,110
There's stuff over there.

492
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,610
How do I get to it?

493
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,990
Hmm, curious.

494
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,150
Black Mesa is for two kinds of people.

495
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,370
People without the patience for old games.

496
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,750
And people who played the old games wanting a new take on them.

497
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,030
That makes sense.

498
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,270
Oh gosh.

499
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:52,810
What was that?

500
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:53,690
Ow!

501
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,230
Ouch!

502
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,130
You...

503
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,830
Bitch!

504
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,010
Oh.

505
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,570
Uh.

506
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,550
Uh.

507
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,770
It's fine.

508
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,330
He's stuck.

509
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,610
Dog's stuck.

510
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,590
Dog's stuck.

511
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,110
Dog's stuck!

512
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,270
Um.

513
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,550
I'll kill him eventually, right?

514
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,190
There we go.

515
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:19,710
Yeah.

516
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,330
Whew!

517
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,210
What about the stuff over there, though?

518
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,890
I kind of want to grab that.

519
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:28,950
Hmm.

520
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,540
Jump?

521
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,960
Jump where?

522
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,180
You can try.

523
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,140
Save?

524
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,920
Oh, so true.

525
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,940
Yeah, let's save and then...

526
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,480
Hold on.

527
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,520
How can I...

528
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,660
I couldn't get around the barrel, though.

529
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,400
Maybe if I...

530
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:50,660
Okay.

531
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:52,980
Okay.

532
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,180
Let me...

533
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,300
Wait.

534
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,960
Let me go back.

535
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,820
Can I even make this?

536
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,640
I don't think I can.

537
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,960
Oh.

538
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,180
I touched the...

539
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,920
I touched the green.

540
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,720
Oh.

541
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,600
Um.

542
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,980
I don't know if I can make it.

543
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,700
I think I messed up.

544
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,600
Get on the slanted portion.

545
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,280
Of what?

546
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,960
This?

547
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,780
Oh.

548
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,860
Oops.

549
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,360
Uh.

550
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,520
Ignore the Geiger sounds?

551
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,170
What's this, anyway?

552
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,590
Okay, anyway.

553
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,050
Um.

554
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,030
Uh.

555
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,530
Yeah.

556
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,120
Anyway.

557
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,860
What a thrill.

558
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,340
Darkness and silence through the night.

559
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,560
You think grandpa's okay?

560
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,180
Bad

561
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:19,910
dog.

562
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,510
Bad, bad dog.

563
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,890
Oh, grandpa.

564
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,450
I guess I could have blown him up with that.

565
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,630
Oopsie.

566
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,050
Wait.

567
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,010
Is that a green?

568
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,810
Ouch!

569
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,190
Oh my god, the dogs.

570
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,570
Non-stop dogs.

571
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:43,830
Non-stop dogs.

572
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,390
Wait, there's a green dog.

573
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,930
Wait, hold on.

574
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,870
Maybe if I pistol this part?

575
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,090
Oh, how do I... Oh, no.

576
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,150
Wait a second.

577
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,730
Will this happen too?

578
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,710
Oh, that's not good.

579
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,810
I think.

580
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,450
Ah!

581
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,290
Hmm.

582
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,020
That one exploded way more than this one did.

583
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,220
Uh, let's do our best.

584
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,800
If not, I'll just reload.

585
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,090
Easy.

586
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:27,770
Easy.

587
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,910
Easy.

588
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,710
I can make this.

589
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,950
Wait, this guy's trying to explode at me.

590
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,510
Nasty.

591
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:37,950
Nasty.

592
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,590
Nasty.

593
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:38,730
Nasty.

594
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,290
Sucker over there.

595
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,410
Dead.

596
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,610
Oh, and there's like two head crabs.

597
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,910
Yeah, cool.

598
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,250
The head crabs are on the other side waving.

599
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,710
They're like, Hey, me too!

600
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,970
Just jump!

601
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,490
Like so.

602
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,820
Okay.

603
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh, wait.

604
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:07,960
Access.

605
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,720
I'm afraid to save though.

606
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,240
Ah!

607
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:12,960
Ah!

608
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,640
Ah!

609
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,320
Ah!

610
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,200
Ah!

611
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:15,760
Ah!

612
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,000
Ah!

613
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Ah!

614
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,000
Uh-oh.

615
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,140
Oh, I'm making this ruckus.

616
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,860
What the hell?

617
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,360
Oh, shut up.

618
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,560
Is that me?

619
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,140
For real?

620
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,120
Oh, I-I don't think that's...

621
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
Shit, doesn't know.

622
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,860
Yeah, I don't know.

623
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,130
I'm scared!

624
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:08,990
Wait.

625
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,770
Do you think I can- Do you think I can quick save?

626
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,290
Or am I gonna be, uh...

627
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,130
Am I-Will I be, um...

628
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,890
Soft locked.

629
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,190
Manual save?

630
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,250
Let's try that, yeah.

631
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,390
New save.

632
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,690
Save.

633
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,910
There's cows in here!

634
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,350
Oh, you're alive!

635
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,270
Wait.

636
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,850
That's a- Rocket engine.

637
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,610
Destroy the damned thing before it grows any larger.

638
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:53,870
Stop!

639
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:54,470
Oh!

640
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,370
Stop!

641
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,370
Okay.

642
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,440
Oh.

643
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,460
Oh.

644
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,260
Shit.

645
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm scared of going in there!

646
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
Oh no!

647
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,070
I don't think I could have done anything.

648
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:33,850
I just feel like, there was nothing that could be done.

649
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,830
Oh, what's this thing?

650
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,570
So if I test fire... Oops, it didn't hear that right?

651
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,890
Oh, it didn't hear that right?

652
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,130
Wait, oh!

653
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,250
Oh, it doesn't see me.

654
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,210
Okay, good.

655
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,310
Woah!

656
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,430
Woah!

657
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,290
Woah!

658
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:03,350
Woah!

659
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:03,490
Woah!

660
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:03,490
Woah!

661
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:03,510
Woah!

662
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,130
Look at the terminal.

663
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,950
So what, I need the power and the oxygen and the fuel?

664
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,930
Try shooting.

665
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,440
Wait, what's going on there?

666
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,980
What is happening?

667
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,120
Wait, what is happening here?

668
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,180
Can I shoot this thing?

669
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,240
They're green people!

670
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,300
Oh.

671
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,400
Sorry.

672
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:41,900
Sorry.

673
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,660
Sorry.

674
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,480
Sorry!

675
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,240
He left them alone, at least.

676
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,420
I'm gonna...

677
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
I mean, I kind of want to see what's going on.

678
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,390
Oh!

679
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,470
They stop as soon as I come in.

680
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:03,170
Alright.

681
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,330
I've never noticed that before.

682
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,030
Now there's all these interesting sounds and everything.

683
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,630
I probably can go up this without getting caught, right?

684
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,950
Die!

685
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,810
Oh!

686
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,020
It's dead.

687
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh my god!

688
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
Oh god!

689
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,820
Barney, you scared the crap out of me!

690
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:38,940
Oh.

691
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,240
Okay, be quiet.

692
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,100
Roger that.

693
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,180
Let's run like hell.

694
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,420
No!

695
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,380
Be quiet!

696
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,560
Barney!

697
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,060
You're just so... No!

698
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,360
Crouch!

699
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,480
Don't run!

700
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,380
Don't run!

701
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,460
Don't run!

702
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:55,940
Oh!

703
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,400
Oh!

704
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,200
That's the room.

705
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,680
Okay, Barney, you stay here.

706
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,040
I'll stay here and guard this area.

707
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,480
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:00,940
Pretty much.

709
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,580
Let's run like hell.

710
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,600
No, you don't do that.

711
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,960
Wait, so... I'm gonna...

712
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,940
I'm gonna save again.

713
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,360
Sorry.

714
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,590
Which... Which was me?

715
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,090
I don't know.

716
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,550
You know what?

717
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:22,970
It's fine.

718
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,210
Here we go.

719
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,540
Oh gosh, how do I go down the stairs?

720
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,080
Uh, ladder.

721
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:38,960
Oh!

722
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,640
Um...

723
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,020
I think I'm in trouble.

724
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,240
Oopsie!

725
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,380
Oopsie!

726
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,620
Okay.

727
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,700
Oh, we're so fine.

728
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:55,980
See?

729
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,960
Okay, I'm gonna get my crowbar out.

730
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,140
Even though...

731
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,720
Well, that didn't really make a difference, I think.

732
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,380
But it's fine.

733
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,000
Okay.

734
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,720
Alright, very carefully.

735
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh, he's so cool though.

736
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,980
I feel like I hear some other stuff around.

737
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,000
No?

738
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,080
No?

739
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,580
Oh no.

740
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,540
How am I supposed to move those boxes?

741
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,740
This doesn't seem good.

742
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,540
Um...

743
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,360
Just grenade them?

744
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,720
Really?

745
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,480
Will it work?

746
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,660
Beep.

747
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,050
Oh.

748
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,090
Hahaha.

749
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,310
Let's see if I distract them over...

750
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,430
That!

751
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:05,750
Oh.

752
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,350
Whoops.

753
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:06,930
My bad.

754
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,230
I didn't realize I had it selected.

755
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:08,650
Over!

756
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,710
That way!

757
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:19,910
I'm scared.

758
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,670
As soon as I start beating this...

759
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,350
As soon as I start beating this up, they're gonna get all...

760
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,670
Use grenades to break the boxes.

761
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,490
I mean...

762
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,190
But then they'll be all...

763
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,310
Clanky on this part, no?

764
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,790
This part used to scare me as a kid, I believe it.

765
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,700
Oh.

766
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,320
Okay, hold on.

767
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,760
One more.

768
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,500
Yes!

769
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,440
Okay.

770
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,120
Now...

771
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,320
Um...

772
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
Okay, now...

773
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,080
Uh!

774
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,930
Yeah, ignore...

775
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:03,630
Ignore this...

776
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,270
Ignore the ladder.

777
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:04,890
There you go.

778
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:05,370
There you go.

779
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,730
There you go.

780
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,060
Anything...

781
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,540
Oh my god, they're so noisy, though.

782
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,040
Shut up!

783
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,120
God, all the noise is coming from you!

784
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,520
Bozos.

785
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,060
I don't think they appreciated that.

786
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,820
Is there anything in there?

787
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,000
Hey!

788
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,480
Where am I supposed to go?

789
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,920
Hold on, I'm trying to check the...

790
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,980
Bottom area.

791
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,740
Oh, maybe down there?

792
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,900
Okay, what I'm gonna do is...

793
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,340
We're gonna...

794
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,420
Wait, do I have enough grenades?

795
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,840
Five hole grenades!

796
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,840
Okay, I'm gonna blow up these two doors, okay?

797
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,580
Easy does it, Gordon.

798
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:05,910
Yes!

799
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:06,830
Oh my god!

800
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,410
Goal!

801
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,250
Did you see that?

802
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,390
That was crazy!

803
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,210
Wow!

804
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,050
That was so good!

805
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,590
Maybe I should've done the lower one...

806
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,470
After...

807
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,170
You know what, it's fine.

808
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:23,930
Okay.

809
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,510
Oops.

810
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:31,850
And...

811
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,950
Uh-oh, I have three left.

812
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,190
There's...

813
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,250
Through!

814
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,330
Yes!

815
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,680
Sorry.

816
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,060
Oh, no, no, no, no.

817
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,560
No load.

818
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,460
Save.

819
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,200
No save.

820
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,580
Okay.

821
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,960
What do I hear?

822
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,480
I just hear something squelching around a bit.

823
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,020
I don't...

824
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,460
I can't tell if it's this guy or not.

825
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,100
He'll get tired...

826
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,120
Oh my god!

827
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,400
You know...

828
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,360
Stupid...

829
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,440
Blind...

830
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,720
Okay.

831
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,160
Now...

832
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,560
We go back to Shoddy.

833
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,480
Oh wait...

834
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Was it this...

835
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,560
Level or...

836
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,140
The one underneath?

837
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,440
Underneath.

838
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,920
Where was that guy?

839
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,320
Hmm.

840
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,360
Back to shiny.

841
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,630
Ah, we're on this side.

842
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,010
Oh my God.

843
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:42,610
What?

844
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,010
You expect me... What do I... What is this?

845
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:46,450
Ah!

846
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,550
Me too.

847
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,250
Yes.

848
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,110
That's me.

849
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,290
Yeah.

850
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,190
Okay.

851
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,490
Everything's fine, guys.

852
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,270
Ignore.

853
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:07,770
Ignore.

854
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,250
Ignore.

855
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:08,690
Ignore.

856
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,490
Ignore.

857
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,050
Ignore.

858
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,510
Nobody does it quite like you.

859
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,130
I think actually many people probably have done that before.

860
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,450
Raise your hand if you've fallen off these pipes.

861
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,570
Everybody's gonna raise their hands.

862
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,650
Sorry, I'm not using the quicksave right now because I am scared about that area.

863
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,990
I don't know if I've accidentally softlocked myself or not.

864
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:44,330
So that's why I haven't been using the... But I am very well aware of it.

865
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,270
I am very well aware of quicksave.

866
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,690
I just don't know if I've accidentally softlocked.

867
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,170
You haven't?

868
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,710
Don't worry.

869
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,190
Really?

870
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,190
How can you be so short?

871
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,170
What are you, a genius?

872
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,170
What?

873
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,770
Have you played this game before or something?

874
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,290
What am I... What am I hearing?

875
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,680
Oh.

876
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,520
This guy.

877
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,320
Oh, there's another one?

878
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,860
Somewhere?

879
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,060
Maybe?

880
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,000
Joke's on you.

881
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,360
I've never played Half-Life 1.

882
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:25,940
Oh.

883
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,420
There's definitely another guy somewhere around here.

884
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,600
What?

885
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,380
What is the purpose of this area anyway?

886
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,280
See?

887
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,840
Ah!

888
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,220
Wait, I need a grandpa!

889
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh, shoot.

890
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,720
Wait, maybe there's a grandpa down here.

891
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,420
Oh, there he is.

892
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,920
I see him.

893
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,300
You nasty.

894
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,230
Auto-activate.

895
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:00,770
Open.

896
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,070
Open, Sesame.

897
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
Oh my god.

898
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,680
Okay, I'm gonna...

899
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,980
Okay, I'm gonna trust...

900
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,780
I'm gonna quicksave...

901
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,280
Anyone with an elderly parrot that they don't need?

902
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,460
Let's go down.

903
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,740
Why am I in the sewers?

904
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,260
Is this radioactive?

905
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,540
I guess not.

906
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,320
Ew!

907
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,280
Oh.

908
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,580
Nasty man.

909
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,080
There we go.

910
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,380
Okay.

911
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,800
He won't bother us anymore.

912
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,840
No Geiger clickers.

913
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,820
Yes, no Geiger clickers.

914
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,100
We'll just...

915
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,480
We'll just stick with the shotgun for now.

916
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,860
Uh...

917
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,360
Uh...

918
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,840
This way?

919
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,300
Nope.

920
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,740
Oh, I'm smelly.

921
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,540
I'm so stinky nasty.

922
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,520
Ooh.

923
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:21,980
Ooh.

924
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,560
I'm in the gross water.

925
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,080
I'm sure...

926
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,060
Hope no one...

927
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,980
Is he in the water?

928
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,560
No way.

929
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,460
No stinking way.

930
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:35,780
Okay.

931
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm gonna have to...

932
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:39,720
Woo!

933
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,980
That works.

934
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,260
Oh, there.

935
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:48,680
Oh.

936
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,820
Wait.

937
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:51,780
Wait.

938
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,400
Wait.

939
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,480
I'm like so close.

940
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,020
Come on.

941
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,360
Gordon, just use your arms.

942
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,560
Oof, ammo.

943
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,720
You're so right.

944
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,480
You're so right.

945
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,720
Actually, oof, ammo on all fronts.

946
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,220
Um...

947
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,180
Where he might be in trouble.

948
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,000
Jump and crouch.

949
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:08,780
Okay.

950
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,360
Wait.

951
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:11,940
Uh.

952
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,260
That didn't...

953
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,180
That doesn't work.

954
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,520
Uh.

955
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,180
Uh.

956
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,460
Yeah.

957
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:19,920
Uh.

958
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,420
That doesn't work.

959
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,060
Oh, man.

960
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,540
I'm gonna have to balance the whole way?

961
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,340
That sucks.

962
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,180
Is there anything up here that I can...

963
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,780
Immediately shoot?

964
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,060
No?

965
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:33,320
Okay.

966
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,460
He's a physicist, not an athlete.

967
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,680
I know.

968
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,220
I just thought, you know...

969
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,870
He might...

970
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,780
Have a little muscle on him.

971
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,620
He's got string bean arms.

972
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,600
It's not his fault.

973
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,600
Wait.

974
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,580
Do I actually have to go through this entire thing?

975
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:54,900
Wait.

976
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,300
How do I...

977
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,600
Okay.

978
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,340
Oh, my God.

979
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,240
He's such a...

980
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,060
He's so sen...

981
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,080
Like, the controls here.

982
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,740
The controls are so...

983
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,320
Sensitive.

984
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:08,520
Okay.

985
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,740
Oh, God.

986
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,900
Okay.

987
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:14,970
Okay.

988
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,950
Okay.

989
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:17,030
Holy.

990
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:19,310
Okay.

991
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,080
I'm losing my balance.

992
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,640
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.

993
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,060
Yeah!

994
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,230
Okay, I'm fine.

995
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,060
Ugh.

996
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,520
Oops.

997
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,200
Oh.

998
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,020
More grenades.

999
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,840
Thank you.

1000
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:10,730
What do I hear?

1001
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,350
Wait.

1002
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,310
Shift is walk, by the way.

1003
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,350
Oh, thank you.

1004
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,210
You know what?

1005
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,310
I think I do remember that.

1006
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,420
Nice.

1007
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,460
I guess I could've.

1008
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,260
Ready for some CQC.

1009
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,000
I hope you're enjoying the gaming, though.

1010
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,660
I love the series as much as you love MGS.

1011
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,720
Thank you, Felix.

1012
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,380
Yeah, I'm having so much fun.

1013
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,250
Stop.

1014
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,850
You're making the door open and close.

1015
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,850
I can't get rid of him.

1016
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:12,410
Oh, he's like doing that typical horror movie trope.

1017
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:13,530
All right, here we go.

1018
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:14,970
Here we go.

1019
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,530
Why does it look like red eyes looking at me?

1020
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,790
Oh, it's the legs.

1021
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:19,250
Thank you.

1022
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,220
What?

1023
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,520
Why does it do that?

1024
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,340
Why is it so aggressive?

1025
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,390
Wait, Gordon Freeman.

1026
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:45,610
Gordon Freeman, please.

1027
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,050
Oh, gosh.

1028
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:47,170
Oh, gosh.

1029
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,400
Excuse me.

1030
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,820
Close quarters, crowbar.

1031
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,640
Okay.

1032
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,320
Oh, my gosh.

1033
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,710
This is... OSHA would like to have a word.

1034
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,510
Quick save here.

1035
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,030
I'm saved.

1036
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,750
Is it gonna break the things at the top?

1037
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,760
Wait, what do you mean too late?

1038
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,720
What do you mean?

1039
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,260
Huh?

1040
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,860
Do I go down?

1041
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,780
I can turn it off.

1042
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,300
Oh, do I need to bomb it?

1043
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,280
Do I need to...

1044
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,720
Oh, oh.

1045
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,280
That was close.

1046
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,640
Do I need to, uh...

1047
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:01,980
Grenade?

1048
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,200
Grenade it.

1049
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,480
You need to get up quickly.

1050
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,260
Go up as soon as you turn it on.

1051
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,620
Okay.

1052
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,480
Go up as soon as...

1053
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,580
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1054
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,020
Oh, okay, okay.

1055
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,710
OSHA would come in and shoot everybody.

1056
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,790
Why is the ladder like...

1057
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,030
All right.

1058
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,690
Okay, I'm gonna be...

1059
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:23,950
All right.

1060
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,870
Well, I just saved.

1061
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,190
It's fine.

1062
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,510
Run!

1063
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:31,910
Oh.

1064
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,150
Oh, I did it.

1065
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,450
Easy peasy.

1066
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,760
All right.

1067
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:44,800
Very nice.

1068
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,300
So that's one thing, no?

1069
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,900
I guess.

1070
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,320
Now jump?

1071
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,140
Oh!

1072
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,100
Oh!

1073
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:07,650
Ah!

1074
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:08,750
Ah!

1075
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:09,710
Ah!

1076
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,240
I got it.

1077
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,820
We're fine.

1078
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,860
Everything's fine.

1079
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,960
Are those lasers or...

1080
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,960
Is this just...

1081
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,040
Red room is scary.

1082
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:27,980
Don't...

1083
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,560
What did I...

1084
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,140
Oh, I got hurt.

1085
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,100
Don't mess with me, little headcrab.

1086
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,220
Oh, I hear something.

1087
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh.

1088
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,720
Just some...

1089
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,400
Just some regular...

1090
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,740
Regular roaches.

1091
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,880
Have you tried swinging a crowbar twice a second IRL?

1092
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,240
You need mad grip strength.

1093
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,980
I believe that.

1094
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,040
Oh, is that something like...

1095
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,460
There's...

1096
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,180
Oh.

1097
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,940
He's like...

1098
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,280
Oh my god.

1099
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,780
He's like waiting for me right there.

1100
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,340
He's gonna...

1101
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,060
He's gonna jump at me as soon as I break this!

1102
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,880
Spawn camping.

1103
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:11,300
Real.

1104
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,500
There's nothing else in here?

1105
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,300
I guess we're just in a vent, so...

1106
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,360
Oh!

1107
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:16,980
Okay.

1108
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,480
Uh...

1109
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,320
I assume I'm going the correct way.

1110
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,760
Alright.

1111
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,280
Hold on.

1112
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,580
Nothing over here?

1113
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,000
Nothing?

1114
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:27,580
Okay.

1115
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,260
What am I hearing?

1116
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,740
What is that?

1117
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:48,570
Okay.

1118
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,030
Oh, you.

1119
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:58,570
Where did he go?

1120
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,290
The other guy.

1121
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:06,990
Okay.

1122
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:09,810
Alright.

1123
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,170
Bro went away.

1124
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:11,930
He's like, I'm not...

1125
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,270
I don't have time to deal with this.

1126
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:14,970
I just don't have...

1127
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,090
I just don't have the time.

1128
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,490
Alright, anything else in here?

1129
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,830
We got some tubes.

1130
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,030
Man, watching...

1131
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:25,010
This really makes me think about how much better ladders have become in games.

1132
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,750
I know!

1133
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,530
It really makes you appreciate it, huh?

1134
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:30,530
Oxygen!

1135
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,550
Fuel on!

1136
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:40,870
Okay.

1137
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,550
Powering on the stuff.

1138
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:44,590
Very nice.

1139
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:44,810
Nice.

1140
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:47,890
Oh.

1141
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:48,570
My bad.

1142
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,750
And here we are on the other side.

1143
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:56,950
Very cool.

1144
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:58,390
Okay.

1145
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,810
What's all...

1146
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,510
The sound now.

1147
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,950
You think Barney's okay?

1148
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:14,570
Whoa!

1149
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:16,970
Neat.

1150
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,290
Okay.

1151
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,130
Um...

1152
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,810
Let's heal.

1153
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,610
And let's save.

1154
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:23,890
And let's do our...

1155
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:24,450
Okay, I'm gonna...

1156
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,170
I'm gonna walk.

1157
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,790
I'm gonna walk across.

1158
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,130
And now...

1159
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,510
Presenting...

1160
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:33,510
Mint Phantom.

1161
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:35,530
Doing...

1162
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,290
The High Rope...

1163
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,530
Walkway.

1164
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:40,870
Oh.

1165
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,350
Okay.

1166
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,690
It was very unimpressive.

1167
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,090
Nevermind.

1168
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:46,890
Nobody...

1169
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,410
Nobody cared.

1170
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,410
Wait, so now...

1171
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:53,950
Was...

1172
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,950
It was...

1173
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,050
Wait, now I have to go...

1174
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,950
Probably to the bottom to get the power, right?

1175
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,210
Because there was three things needed?

1176
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,630
I cared.

1177
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,970
Wait, why did I...

1178
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,110
Why did my health go down?

1179
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,860
Oh...

1180
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,660
Oh...

1181
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,840
So rude.

1182
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,660
So rude.

1183
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,080
Stinking guys.

1184
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,090
I didn't even fall!

1185
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,980
Oh, they're like kinda camping like...

1186
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,420
That ladder.

1187
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,360
That's why I think.

1188
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,700
Let's see.

1189
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,380
Oh!

1190
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:55,900
Oh!

1191
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,440
Oh!

1192
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,340
Oh!

1193
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,210
He just...

1194
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,810
He treated me like a damn bird.

1195
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,830
He was like...

1196
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:12,210
Beep beep!

1197
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,910
What the hell was that?

1198
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,430
Alright.

1199
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,040
Turn all your efforts to the other side.

1200
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:28,740
Thank you.

1201
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,700
Yes, yes.

1202
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:32,700
Little boop boop.

1203
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,290
Wait, oh, this is the door.

1204
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:44,850
I was like...

1205
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:45,910
What door did I break down?

1206
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,630
Did you actually save that, Barney?

1207
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,190
Normally, he runs at the tentacles and gets smashed.

1208
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,090
Talking to him must have stopped that.

1209
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:55,910
Really?

1210
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,070
I am a savior!

1211
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,690
I am a savior!

1212
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,970
A friend to Barney.

1213
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,250
Alright, we got this.

1214
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:16,770
Whoop!

1215
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:18,130
Whoop!

1216
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,050
Whoop!

1217
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:19,650
Whoop!

1218
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,110
Wanna see something cool?

1219
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,610
Press a wall and press T?

1220
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:30,950
Hi graffiti!

1221
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:32,370
What?

1222
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:34,930
Oh my gosh.

1223
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,220
Wait, can I make this?

1224
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:41,880
Uh oh.

1225
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,080
T.

1226
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,660
Oh, I can't do it again.

1227
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,050
Uh...

1228
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:54,870
I think so.

1229
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,430
Crouch jump.

1230
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,810
Don't forget the crouch jump.

1231
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,770
But I gotta get a running start, no?

1232
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,110
Hold on.

1233
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:05,790
Once again.

1234
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,650
Okay, here we go.

1235
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,650
Whoop!

1236
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,310
Oh, sorry.

1237
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:12,590
Uh...

1238
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,470
Okay, hold on.

1239
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,070
Uh...

1240
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,730
Oh, I don't need to crouch jump.

1241
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,650
Three little guys in a row.

1242
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,200
I think you can customize the spray.

1243
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh, neat.

1244
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,180
Oh, you can.

1245
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,020
Okay.

1246
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,110
Once again.

1247
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,290
I am saving.

1248
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,050
That's the one that I broke big time, I think.

1249
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,130
And I killed this guy.

1250
00:58:58,650 --> 00:58:59,290
Ugh.

1251
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:00,970
Dogs.

1252
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,810
Okay, come here, dog.

1253
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:07,570
Yep, come here, dog.

1254
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:10,130
Okay.

1255
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,810
It's like...

1256
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,010
It feel...

1257
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,170
It reminds me of like, uh...

1258
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:14,810
The...

1259
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:16,510
Dogs in like...

1260
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,470
Silent Hill.

1261
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:19,630
Okay.

1262
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,890
I imagine...

1263
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,340
This is gonna be like, electrified.

1264
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,230
Once we turn on the power, huh?

1265
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,050
Is this gonna be like...

1266
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,280
Okay, let's test our...

1267
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,390
Oh, we're so dead.

1268
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:34,310
But chirpier.

1269
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,620
Hmm.

1270
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,220
He's just feasting away.

1271
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,200
Good observation.

1272
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,040
Good to know that...

1273
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,060
I might be right.

1274
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,800
And...

1275
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,300
Oh.

1276
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,360
That's...

1277
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,360
That kinda sucks.

1278
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,540
Um...

1279
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,060
He's like, what the hell was that?

1280
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,880
He's joking.

1281
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,600
He doesn't know at all what hit him.

1282
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,340
Uh...

1283
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,420
Excuse me!

1284
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,360
Oh my gosh, I thought that was a rope.

1285
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:16,840
Oh!

1286
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,140
That scared...

1287
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,540
Wait, there's multiple of them!

1288
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,200
I thought they were ropes for...

1289
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,480
Because there's these ropes!

1290
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,500
Wait, there's so many of them!

1291
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,440
Oh my god.

1292
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,310
Holy shit.

1293
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,050
What?

1294
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:41,950
Oh wait.

1295
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:42,690
No, please.

1296
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:44,030
Please don't do this to me.

1297
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:46,410
What's that?

1298
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:47,290
Come on.

1299
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:47,790
There we go.

1300
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,150
There we go.

1301
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:48,670
Nice, nice.

1302
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:52,210
Ah, yeah!

1303
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:53,910
Okay.

1304
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,820
I wish I could get stuff for my...

1305
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,400
For my armor, but for now we just...

1306
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,060
Oh my gosh.

1307
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,860
I'm gonna forget these guys are here for real.

1308
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,380
We'll be fine though.

1309
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:10,860
Probably.

1310
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,120
Oh!

1311
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:14,920
Whoa!

1312
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:16,860
Whoa!

1313
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,420
This game is so atmospheric.

1314
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,160
It's awesome.

1315
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:21,520
Uh-oh.

1316
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,000
Who is...

1317
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,620
Who is here?

1318
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,720
It's so science.

1319
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,500
You're right, madam.

1320
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:38,800
Oh!

1321
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,280
Uh-oh.

1322
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,680
Oh, boy.

1323
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,120
What do you mean by that?

1324
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,020
What's happening?

1325
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,580
There's...

1326
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,680
There's four guys on that elevator!

1327
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,020
Oh!

1328
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,140
Wait, do I need to jump?

1329
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,600
Oh.

1330
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:58,900
Uh...

1331
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,780
Jump to the ladder.

1332
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,240
Let's see it.

1333
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:02,440
Ah!

1334
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,480
Ah!

1335
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,490
What a thrill.

1336
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:16,010
With darkness.

1337
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,310
Wait, I was going down, right?

1338
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,590
Yeah.

1339
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:18,010
Okay.

1340
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,550
Silence through the night.

1341
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,170
What a thrill.

1342
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:25,490
Um...

1343
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:25,810
Stuck?

1344
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:26,410
A ladder.

1345
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:26,830
Okay.

1346
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,830
Mr. Scientist!

1347
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,010
Get behind me, scientist.

1348
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:35,490
What's here?

1349
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,750
I hope no one needs to start up the generator.

1350
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,730
Smithers went down there and never came back.

1351
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:41,290
Okay.

1352
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:42,310
Good to know.

1353
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:43,750
Smithers.

1354
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,190
That guy is probably now...

1355
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,610
Oh.

1356
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:46,790
Oh.

1357
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:47,030
Sorry.

1358
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:47,870
He's still talking.

1359
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,730
I was gonna say he's now smithereens.

1360
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:51,650
Oh.

1361
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,010
You do?

1362
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:52,630
What?

1363
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,550
Was that a sneeze?

1364
01:02:59,010 --> 01:02:59,490
Okay.

1365
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:00,270
I'll protect him.

1366
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:00,510
I'll protect you.

1367
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:01,370
Einstein.

1368
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,030
Oh.

1369
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:07,430
Oh.

1370
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,700
What the hell was...

1371
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,160
Oh, was that?

1372
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,120
I was like, what is that running around up there?

1373
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,780
What is this?

1374
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,120
Oh.

1375
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:20,780
Hate that.

1376
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,120
Let's just chill it in the...

1377
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,280
Wait, am I...

1378
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,280
Did I hit him or no?

1379
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:25,980
I think from here.

1380
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:26,260
Good.

1381
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,280
Your aim sucks.

1382
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,740
Little dog.

1383
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:32,660
Ahem.

1384
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:32,980
Oh.

1385
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:33,000
Oh.

1386
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,040
Oh.

1387
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,080
I'm depending...

1388
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,020
I need more ammo.

1389
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:36,900
Game, please.

1390
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:38,820
Whoa.

1391
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:39,640
Oh.

1392
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,380
Oh God.

1393
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,120
Okay.

1394
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:42,720
Oh.

1395
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,100
Okay.

1396
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,680
So then I...

1397
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,100
Climb.

1398
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,320
Okay.

1399
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,320
It's a little puzzle, huh?

1400
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:47,860
Okay.

1401
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,560
I think...

1402
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,260
Oh gosh.

1403
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,300
But this thing will kill me.

1404
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,220
No?

1405
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:52,940
Oh.

1406
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:53,560
Yeah.

1407
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,280
Oh.

1408
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,500
I have to be so fast.

1409
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,800
Oh my God.

1410
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,460
This part makes no sense.

1411
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,320
What?

1412
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,780
Shotty sniping.

1413
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,440
I know.

1414
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:04,640
Oh.

1415
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:04,720
Ah.

1416
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,540
I guess I can go to either one.

1417
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,050
Okay.

1418
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:23,510
Cool.

1419
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:26,250
Okay.

1420
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:26,930
We're going to this one.

1421
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,440
Okay.

1422
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,660
Oh no.

1423
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,340
Smithers.

1424
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,460
That has to be him, right?

1425
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:39,680
Oh.

1426
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:40,720
That's you, right?

1427
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,180
Smithers.

1428
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:44,340
But...

1429
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,960
This is my hiding spot.

1430
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,220
So I'm not moving until the situation is drastically improved.

1431
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,320
Now go away.

1432
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,100
And don't tell anyone I'm here.

1433
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,380
He's not old Smithereens.

1434
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,240
I think he's about to be though.

1435
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,400
Once I turn this on, no?

1436
01:04:59,500 --> 01:04:59,940
Okay.

1437
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:00,880
Good luck, old man.

1438
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,520
Wait.

1439
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,620
Do I have to do each side?

1440
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,500
Don't tell me.

1441
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:05,700
Wait.

1442
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:05,960
Uh oh.

1443
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,280
I just activated something else.

1444
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:11,580
Hey boo.

1445
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:13,300
Okay.

1446
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,180
They're both sides.

1447
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:16,920
Um.

1448
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,340
Uh okay.

1449
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:21,240
Oh.

1450
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,100
What is this?

1451
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,620
Ah.

1452
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,120
Oh dear.

1453
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,460
What's happening?

1454
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,400
What's happening?

1455
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:28,480
What's happening?

1456
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1457
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,160
Uh.

1458
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:32,920
Ah.

1459
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:34,760
Oh dear.

1460
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,640
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1461
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,260
Run where are you guys?

1462
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,560
I think we're about to be exploded.

1463
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,420
Oh dear.

1464
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,620
Maybe onto this tightrope.

1465
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:54,860
Oh.

1466
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,660
I go in here?

1467
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:00,640
Whoa.

1468
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,780
Dang Gordon.

1469
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,720
Into the light.

1470
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,040
Go into the light.

1471
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:10,860
Wait.

1472
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:11,920
How do I get down from here?

1473
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,680
I think I'm...

1474
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,560
I think I'm dead for real.

1475
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,520
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1476
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,860
I can't jump from here.

1477
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1478
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,260
Like a moth to a flame.

1479
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,280
Go in?

1480
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,540
Really?

1481
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,480
Touch it?

1482
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:28,840
Okay...

1483
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,880
Yeah... Tastes like blue raspberry.

1484
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,650
Thank you for the... Oh no!

1485
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,750
Okay, we're fine.

1486
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:58,570
Thank you for the rain!

1487
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:00,810
I'm

1488
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,420
a little trapped right now.

1489
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,520
I'm a little...

1490
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,240
I'm a bit in a predicament.

1491
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,380
I think I just need to fall.

1492
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,860
Wait, can I climb down this?

1493
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,300
Oh...

1494
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:22,840
Holy...

1495
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,700
I'm alive!

1496
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,300
Wait...

1497
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,660
Oh yeah, I just pressed this button.

1498
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,540
Okay, we get back.

1499
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:51,650
Yippee!

1500
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:54,430
I think we made it.

1501
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:58,250
Thank you guys for the gift and thank you!

1502
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:00,390
Was that a high-pitched, goofy laugh?

1503
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:01,510
No?

1504
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,290
I saw...

1505
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,530
Someone has restored all power.

1506
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:08,850
We'll have the engine up again in no time.

1507
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:09,510
That's me!

1508
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:10,550
Give me credit.

1509
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,650
Credit where credit is due.

1510
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,790
Ask the doctor to heal you?

1511
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,650
Oh, shoot.

1512
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,370
With my brains and I'm slowing you down.

1513
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:18,830
Nevermind.

1514
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:19,650
Sorry.

1515
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:20,890
We're not gonna come back here anyway.

1516
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,330
I guess it's fine.

1517
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,170
Oh, um...

1518
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,020
Oh.

1519
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:37,250
Doctor.

1520
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:37,510
Doctor.

1521
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,830
It's so dark.

1522
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,970
Lurker, thank you so much!

1523
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,430
Oh, how do I...

1524
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,370
Thank you for the...

1525
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,090
Do I...

1526
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:03,850
Do I jump?

1527
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:05,650
No way.

1528
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,830
Fall with style.

1529
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:14,890
Oof!

1530
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,090
Major fracture detected.

1531
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:17,590
Oh!

1532
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:19,770
Oh, ouch.

1533
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,710
Oh, man.

1534
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:31,070
I fell with style and with grace.

1535
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:31,690
Okay.

1536
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:32,330
Yeah.

1537
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,730
Yeah, I knew this was coming.

1538
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,170
Okay.

1539
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:36,610
Ah.

1540
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:37,790
Alright.

1541
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:39,890
Hmm.

1542
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:46,790
The boxes.

1543
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:47,610
Yes.

1544
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:48,510
That's what I was thinking.

1545
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:49,990
Can I...

1546
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,130
Yeah.

1547
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:50,950
Like so.

1548
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:51,790
Come here.

1549
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:53,450
Oh, my gosh.

1550
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:53,990
Watch out.

1551
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,590
I wish I wasn't so bad at grabbing these.

1552
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,230
Okay.

1553
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:04,610
Okay.

1554
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,230
Oh, gosh.

1555
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:07,850
Dang it.

1556
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:11,810
Why is this so difficult?

1557
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:15,530
Ugh.

1558
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,290
Wait.

1559
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:17,550
Okay.

1560
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:17,990
There we go.

1561
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:20,070
Okay.

1562
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,050
Old game.

1563
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,130
Yeah.

1564
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,170
That's okay.

1565
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,010
We got this.

1566
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:34,350
Okay.

1567
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:34,910
Nice.

1568
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,530
There's one.

1569
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:37,870
Grab.

1570
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:39,450
Okay.

1571
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:40,690
That was actually pretty good.

1572
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,990
That was actually pretty good.

1573
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:43,250
Nice.

1574
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:44,010
Nice.

1575
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:44,230
Nice.

1576
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,150
Nice.

1577
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,830
Nice.

1578
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:46,330
Nice.

1579
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,210
Okay.

1580
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,710
And then...

1581
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:50,910
A little bit more.

1582
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,210
We make a little bridge.

1583
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,030
I probably only need like...

1584
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,690
A little bit.

1585
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:04,930
I think...

1586
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,770
I only need a few and then I can just jump across the rest.

1587
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,410
We're doing sides.

1588
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,150
We're doing sides.

1589
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:10,270
Yes.

1590
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:12,470
She's cooking, your honor.

1591
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:13,490
She doesn't know.

1592
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:13,930
I don't know.

1593
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,690
What are you talking about?

1594
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:15,210
I don't know.

1595
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:16,390
Of course I don't know.

1596
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,330
I've never played this game before.

1597
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:25,830
Oh.

1598
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:28,410
Okay.

1599
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:30,070
Okay.

1600
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,290
I think we'll make it.

1601
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,970
I think we'll make it.

1602
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,660
Ignore what the lady says.

1603
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,010
You technically made it.

1604
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:57,990
Dang it.

1605
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,290
I thought we would have more.

1606
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,810
I thought we would have had more of a...

1607
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:02,970
You know.

1608
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,050
Oh my god.

1609
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:06,870
Oh my god.

1610
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:07,710
Now we have to go...

1611
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,910
All the way back up.

1612
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:12,330
Thank you for the soup.

1613
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:13,710
Uh...

1614
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:14,350
You're welcome.

1615
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,950
How many grenades do we have anyway?

1616
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,470
Eight.

1617
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,210
Turning it down.

1618
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,390
The clanging is too much.

1619
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,830
I'm manually saving.

1620
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,030
Why are they green?

1621
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,450
Cause they're really special.

1622
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,350
It's their favorite color.

1623
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:41,310
Okay.

1624
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,810
Nice.

1625
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,740
It's my favorite color too.

1626
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,300
Oh my gosh.

1627
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,640
Is that why your name is...

1628
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,360
Vert?

1629
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,060
Ver?

1630
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,980
However you pronounce...

1631
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:04,240
Oops.

1632
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,140
Uh...

1633
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:05,920
That was a failure.

1634
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:06,880
Wait a minute.

1635
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:07,820
Maybe it wasn't a failure.

1636
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,040
Oh.

1637
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:11,840
Actually...

1638
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,520
That worked.

1639
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,220
Today is the...

1640
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:15,820
My birthday!

1641
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,380
Skeleton soup!

1642
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,360
Happy birthday!

1643
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:19,760
Give me a second.

1644
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,800
I'll sing...

1645
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,860
Happy birthday.

1646
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:22,560
Oh god.

1647
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,560
No!

1648
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,140
No please!

1649
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:24,900
I will die!

1650
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:34,570
That's not exactly where I needed you to focus on.

1651
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:38,070
But what we will do...

1652
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,290
Maybe it's okay actually.

1653
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:42,210
That guy's like just poking right next to it.

1654
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:43,730
Never mind.

1655
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:44,510
He's poking it.

1656
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:44,930
Okay.

1657
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:45,390
Hold on.

1658
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:46,490
Over...

1659
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:46,890
There!

1660
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:54,030
And I thought he was gonna go after me!

1661
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,730
Skeleton soup!

1662
01:13:55,730 --> 01:14:00,130
Happy birthday to...

1663
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:00,830
You...

1664
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,650
Happy...

1665
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:05,350
Birthday...

1666
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,090
To...

1667
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:07,810
You...

1668
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,370
Happy birthday...

1669
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:10,850
Dear...

1670
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:15,290
Skeleton soup...

1671
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,910
Happy birthday... to you...

1672
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:22,830
Happy birthday!

1673
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,310
Let's get some more grenades.

1674
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:27,190
I wish... I wish this was ammo...

1675
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,290
that I could take.

1676
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,050
Hey there, Barney.

1677
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:30,450
Excuse me.

1678
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:31,010
Please move.

1679
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,730
Okay.

1680
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,350
Alright.

1681
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,530
Okay, save.

1682
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,150
Oh, it's Barney.

1683
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,210
Sorry, I said Bernie.

1684
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,350
Test fire!

1685
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,540
I'm on fire?

1686
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,620
Wait, I'm on fire, I think.

1687
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,700
Am I gonna die?

1688
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,900
Wait, is Barney okay?

1689
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,260
He's probably fine.

1690
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,200
He's probably fine.

1691
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:25,720
Oh.

1692
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,420
Thank you for your sacrifice.

1693
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,680
Now what?

1694
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,140
Do I go all the way down there?

1695
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,460
In the hole.

1696
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,420
I think he's okay.

1697
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,620
He probably got out just in time.

1698
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,020
And like, just left a little bit of a...

1699
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:02,580
You know.

1700
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,260
He accidentally dropped some...

1701
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:06,720
STUFF!

1702
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,440
Hehehe...

1703
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:15,920
Hehehe...

1704
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,280
Hehehe...

1705
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:17,800
Hehehe...

1706
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,520
Ah, m...

1707
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,400
Shucks.

1708
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,260
Hehehehehe...

1709
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,780
Death by...

1710
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,700
Weak knees...

1711
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,100
Hehehehehe...

1712
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,840
I was too silly...

1713
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,420
Okay.

1714
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:34,480
Okay.

1715
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,260
Alright.

1716
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:37,840
Alright.

1717
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:39,880
We'll get it this time.

1718
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:40,920
Gamers!

1719
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,000
Alright, gamers!

1720
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,300
I

1721
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,330
have weakness!

1722
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:12,310
Gees!

1723
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,070
Liger counter.

1724
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:21,370
New gun!

1725
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:25,310
Oh gosh, why is it so spooky down here for real?

1726
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,670
Oh!

1727
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:27,170
Oh!

1728
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:27,850
Doctor!

1729
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,330
Are you okay?

1730
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:36,770
Oh!

1731
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:39,610
What the hell is that?

1732
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:42,510
Okay.

1733
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:45,090
Is that the rest of the guy?

1734
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:47,070
Six shots.

1735
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:51,690
It's the root.

1736
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,290
Okay, that didn't quite do what I thought it would do.

1737
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,810
We still have slot four open.

1738
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,030
I wonder what that will be.

1739
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:10,370
Alright.

1740
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:11,930
Don't worry, he's dead.

1741
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:12,610
Okay, okay.

1742
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:14,970
Let's try our new gun.

1743
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,330
Wow!

1744
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:21,410
Oh gosh.

1745
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,390
Oh gosh.

1746
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:26,630
Oh, okay.

1747
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:27,450
Oh god.

1748
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:28,050
Oh gosh.

1749
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:28,490
Oh gosh.

1750
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:28,910
Wait.

1751
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:32,970
No way!

1752
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:35,230
No way!

1753
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,900
Oh, this is down.

1754
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:44,820
Okay.

1755
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:45,580
Okay.

1756
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,640
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1757
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,160
Okay.

1758
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:48,500
New gun!

1759
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,160
Don't touch the...

1760
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,360
Don't touch that.

1761
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:54,880
Is there... Is there like a door or something that I missed?

1762
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:12,780
Wait...

1763
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:13,080
Wait!

1764
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:13,840
Wait!

1765
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:14,400
Wait!

1766
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:14,800
Wait!

1767
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:16,000
Wait!

1768
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:16,640
Wait!

1769
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:18,860
Wait!

1770
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:22,840
I'm gonna die!

1771
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,400
User death imminent.

1772
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,160
User death imminent.

1773
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,180
Can I get a hint here?

1774
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,020
What do I...

1775
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,020
Where do I go?

1776
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,920
I can't tell at all.

1777
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,560
Can I get a hint?

1778
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:43,600
I'm stuck.

1779
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:46,300
Just...

1780
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,160
You go through the water just the other way.

1781
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,360
Down, side, up.

1782
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,610
I have to swim up one of the sides.

1783
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:58,830
Do I have enough HP?

1784
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,010
Ah!

1785
01:20:13,690 --> 01:20:14,650
Oh my gosh.

1786
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,570
I almost didn't make it.

1787
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,830
That was close.

1788
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:22,690
That was a close...

1789
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:23,130
What was that?

1790
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:27,550
That was a close one.

1791
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:33,840
Oh!

1792
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,160
Oh, there they are.

1793
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,100
They're just floating in circles.

1794
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,160
Health!

1795
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:40,420
Health!

1796
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,400
Please!

1797
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,900
Wait, I'm gonna save here.

1798
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:45,580
There we go.

1799
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:50,980
Watch as I drop to my death.

1800
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,720
Oh my gosh!

1801
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:53,380
And the armor!

1802
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,680
This is big!

1803
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,480
We're doing it!

1804
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,520
Yeah!

1805
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,600
Alright, alright, alright.

1806
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,940
Now let's go back up.

1807
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,370
Very good.

1808
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,150
Very good.

1809
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,290
And save again.

1810
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:26,150
He's admiring the revolver!

1811
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:26,530
Wait!

1812
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,930
Does he do that for all the guns?

1813
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:29,210
Let's try the pistol.

1814
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,110
Do you like the pistol too?

1815
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,220
He's kinda playing with it, but the revolver, he felt things.

1816
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:38,960
I could tell.

1817
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,340
I could tell!

1818
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,620
Just an orange box!

1819
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:44,500
Alright.

1820
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:46,340
Let's go.

1821
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,380
Onward!

1822
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,040
I think this is...

1823
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,820
The way I'm supposed to go.

1824
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,160
Or...

1825
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,500
Not.

1826
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,700
Oh wait, yes maybe.

1827
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,180
Yes.

1828
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,740
They're so cute!

1829
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,780
They're like little...

1830
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:11,700
School children.

1831
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,520
Little ducks.

1832
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:13,600
Little ducks.

1833
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:19,290
Alrighty.

1834
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,090
Okay.

1835
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:26,690
Oh...

1836
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:28,850
Oh...

1837
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:29,490
Oh...

1838
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:29,990
Oh...

1839
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,150
Okay.

1840
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:31,330
I was gonna say, this is...

1841
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:32,010
This is kinda mean.

1842
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:36,110
Yeah.

1843
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:36,750
Wait.

1844
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:37,770
Wait.

1845
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:39,090
Wait.

1846
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,050
Yeah.

1847
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,330
Wait.

1848
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:42,390
Yep.

1849
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,570
Yep.

1850
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,080
Okay.

1851
01:22:59,260 --> 01:22:59,560
Easy.

1852
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:00,560
Easy!

1853
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,360
What's in here?

1854
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,000
Oh, did I just get hurt from that?

1855
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,220
Hell no.

1856
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:10,580
Oh.

1857
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,460
Dang it.

1858
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,240
Hold on.

1859
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:13,840
I'm not...

1860
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,300
Save scumming or anything.

1861
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:15,860
I'm...

1862
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:15,980
You know.

1863
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:21,710
Gord.

1864
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,310
Gordy.

1865
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:22,770
Gordo!

1866
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:23,510
Oh.

1867
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:24,410
Say we're fine.

1868
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:27,750
4 HP...

1869
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:28,270
I...

1870
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,470
I'm...

1871
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,650
I'm at half life.

1872
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,290
Actually, maybe I'm playing the game correctly.

1873
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:34,670
What are you...

1874
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:35,550
To send a real one.

1875
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,450
I hope you're having fun touring the Gatorade factory.

1876
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,830
I don't...

1877
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:41,790
This is my least favorite Gatorade flavor.

1878
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:42,870
I'd say.

1879
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,140
Okay.

1880
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:48,160
Oi!

1881
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,080
Alright.

1882
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,880
You can jump from above?

1883
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:03,780
Oh.

1884
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,400
You can?

1885
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,300
But I gotta make it into the hole.

1886
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,580
I'm not good at getting off the ladders once I'm on.

1887
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:13,920
Okay.

1888
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:16,260
Let's try this.

1889
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,740
A wheel?

1890
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:18,900
Oh!

1891
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,340
This!

1892
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,500
I did miss that.

1893
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:21,880
Thank you.

1894
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:25,260
Oh.

1895
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:26,300
Uh.

1896
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,200
Oh!

1897
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:35,960
Oh!

1898
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,180
Oh!

1899
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:41,860
Yippee!

1900
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:42,660
Alright.

1901
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,060
Okay.

1902
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,120
Where...

1903
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,860
Where does he even think he's going?

1904
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,080
Happy New Year!

1905
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:51,800
Membo!

1906
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:52,520
Thank you!

1907
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,700
Toxic waste is your least favorite Gatorade flavor?

1908
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,340
Yeah.

1909
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,540
I can't say he's my favorite.

1910
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,100
I pre...

1911
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,700
I much prefer...

1912
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,480
Rat poison.

1913
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:41,030
I saw that little guy under the table too.

1914
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:43,430
That guy's waiting to ambush me also.

1915
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,210
This place is so...

1916
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,750
Not great...

1917
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:49,570
At keeping up...

1918
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:49,970
With...

1919
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:51,010
Their...

1920
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:51,710
Um, you know...

1921
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:52,110
Everything.

1922
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:54,550
Wait...

1923
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,790
What am I supposed to do here?

1924
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:58,930
Oh!

1925
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,290
Alright, hold on.

1926
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,510
Okay, hold on.

1927
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:11,530
So...

1928
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:12,350
How do I do this?

1929
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:13,480
Do I...

1930
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,090
Go down?

1931
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,870
Yeah, but...

1932
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:16,730
What the?!

1933
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,400
Aim for the table.

1934
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:23,880
Okay.

1935
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:27,820
Oh!

1936
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:40,470
We got that guy.

1937
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:40,830
Good!

1938
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:43,010
That was so nice!

1939
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,470
What is this?

1940
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:52,950
Wait, what is this?

1941
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,250
What did I grab?

1942
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:54,870
What is this?

1943
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:56,930
A projector.

1944
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,280
Okay.

1945
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,900
There's little booties and stuff in here.

1946
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:08,880
Okay.

1947
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:09,000
Okay.

1948
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:10,720
Oh, wait.

1949
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,740
These are the ones that I push.

1950
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:13,440
Move, please.

1951
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,100
Move, please.

1952
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,400
Move, please.

1953
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,520
It's a camera.

1954
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,660
What else did I just grab?

1955
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,920
How do I use it?

1956
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:27,700
It looks like...

1957
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,140
It doesn't look like a camera at all.

1958
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,440
It looks like a projector, you guys.

1959
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,800
It even is projecting in the photo.

1960
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,340
Like in its little...

1961
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:38,280
Like in its little...

1962
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,260
Oh, it's a mine!

1963
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:42,760
Oh!

1964
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:43,960
Wait, let's try it.

1965
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,280
Power up.

1966
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,300
Oh!

1967
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:57,700
What's going on there?

1968
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,600
He's got by donning him.

1969
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:14,060
I see.

1970
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,500
Wait a second.

1971
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,880
I understand how it works now.

1972
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,800
Did I get everything in here?

1973
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:20,720
What is...

1974
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,640
What's with these though?

1975
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,540
Maybe if I wanted to get back up?

1976
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,440
Okay, anyway.

1977
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,440
Um...

1978
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,800
Do I have...

1979
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,120
Not a lot of ammo.

1980
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,320
I'm not gonna lie.

1981
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,140
I'm also going for it!

1982
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,200
Wait, um...

1983
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,040
Maybe I should run.

1984
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,260
These guys seem kind of dumb.

1985
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:45,510
Oh.

1986
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,130
Ah!

1987
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:57,880
I

1988
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,520
think he got me in one shot.

1989
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:05,280
Ew!

1990
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:08,480
Ew!

1991
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:17,380
Gee, man.

1992
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,820
Holy cow.

1993
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,360
What am I hearing?

1994
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,120
I don't...

1995
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,580
Oh my gosh.

1996
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:35,060
Of course.

1997
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:37,780
Where are they?

1998
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:38,800
Oh, here you are.

1999
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:39,280
Hey!

2000
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:43,200
Stupid.

2001
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,180
Oh, there's like so...

2002
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:46,340
Oh!

2003
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:46,660
Wow!

2004
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:47,820
Oh!

2005
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,400
There goes all my ammo.

2006
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:53,580
Um...

2007
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:55,000
Dammit!

2008
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:55,460
Oh!

2009
01:29:58,980 --> 01:29:59,560
Dammit!

2010
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,240
Dammit!

2011
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,120
I think I got...

2012
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,260
Oh!

2013
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:03,800
Dang it!

2014
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,040
Okay.

2015
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:10,060
Um...

2016
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:10,520
Where...

2017
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,560
Ah...

2018
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,460
I'm...

2019
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:13,400
I'm doing my best!

2020
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,200
Gosh!

2021
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,960
I'm doing my best here!

2022
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:35,110
Okay.

2023
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:36,450
All right.

2024
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,750
Oh, the revolver!

2025
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:38,210
That's right!

2026
01:30:38,470 --> 01:30:39,370
Forgot I got it.

2027
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:41,610
He's gone.

2028
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,530
Where did he go?

2029
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:45,490
Ah!

2030
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:54,280
No, booby!

2031
01:30:58,820 --> 01:30:59,920
Oh, booby!

2032
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,460
Oh, thank goodness.

2033
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:05,320
Oh my gosh.

2034
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,840
Don't see me.

2035
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:09,140
Um...

2036
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,640
Track power is now...

2037
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:11,780
Oh!

2038
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,680
All the way from here!

2039
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,680
Okay, uh...

2040
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:21,500
Um...

2041
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,600
Okay, uh...

2042
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:23,380
Revolver!

2043
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:26,780
Now you know why they call me revolver!

2044
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:31,490
Uh...

2045
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:31,970
All right.

2046
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:33,870
Oh!

2047
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:34,390
Oh!

2048
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:35,350
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

2049
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,670
Dang, it's so powerful!

2050
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:41,290
And then...

2051
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:42,150
Um...

2052
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,450
I'll just keep using it.

2053
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:49,290
There it is.

2054
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:52,070
Oh.

2055
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:54,630
Stop admiring the gun and shoot it!

2056
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,560
I'm Ocelot real!

2057
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:02,920
I'm Ocelot real!

2058
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,200
Wooo!

2059
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:04,180
Wooo!

2060
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,120
Hahaha!

2061
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,320
Sick shots!

2062
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,300
Oh!

2063
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:15,840
Ouch!

2064
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,140
Um...

2065
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,340
I'm gonna die!

2066
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,420
I'm gonna die!

2067
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:22,740
Oh!

2068
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,700
This is suffering!

2069
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,040
I have, like, no health at all!

2070
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:28,600
Hahaha!

2071
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:30,580
This...

2072
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:30,960
Oh, wait.

2073
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:31,480
That's the...

2074
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,840
There's that other guy coming through, huh?

2075
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,240
Wait, where is he?

2076
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:36,480
Pro tip.

2077
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,440
I think I just took more damage.

2078
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:48,260
Oh my god.

2079
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,440
That could've gotten me.

2080
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,280
But I think I just activated a...

2081
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:53,540
Uh-oh.

2082
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:55,280
Uh...

2083
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:55,880
Uh...

2084
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,300
He sounds like he's walking around.

2085
01:32:59,260 --> 01:32:59,860
Yeah!

2086
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:00,600
Yeah!

2087
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:01,240
Yeah!

2088
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,720
Yeah!

2089
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,260
Yeah!

2090
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:05,740
Yeah!

2091
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:05,820
Yeah!

2092
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,600
What else do I hear clicking?

2093
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:09,340
Okay.

2094
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:09,900
I don't know.

2095
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:14,220
Mister, you can get the power on.

2096
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,580
That train will take us straight to the surface.

2097
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:18,020
Ah...

2098
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:20,680
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

2099
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:22,740
What did you say?

2100
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:22,840
Hey!

2101
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,300
Things in the way.

2102
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:26,140
Hold on.

2103
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,280
I didn't see your super chat.

2104
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:27,800
I'm sorry.

2105
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,660
What did you say?

2106
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,800
Oh, the black hair with the twin tails is really cute.

2107
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,000
I'm glad you like it!

2108
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:35,920
Thank you!

2109
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,180
Okay.

2110
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:44,660
I feel like I'm stupid for saving here, but I will.

2111
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,340
Can I get him?

2112
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,600
Without him noticing me?

2113
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,680
He's spawn camping?

2114
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,420
Oh my god!

2115
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,100
I'll do my best for you, Barney!

2116
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,960
I'll do my best!

2117
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:31,760
That's not power?

2118
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:33,520
What do you mean that- Oh, it still says off.

2119
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,100
Wait, where's the power?

2120
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,590
What was that?

2121
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:42,750
If that's not the power?

2122
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:50,050
Oh, it's downstairs.

2123
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:50,890
Oh!

2124
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:51,990
Oh, it's downstairs.

2125
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:52,730
Wait, what is this then?

2126
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:55,390
Oh,

2127
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:02,940
it's the track alignment.

2128
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:03,300
Oh.

2129
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:05,740
You're...

2130
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,920
Well, I still have to do this...

2131
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,480
Anyway, right?

2132
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:12,700
Probably?

2133
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,100
Right!

2134
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,210
Oh, you don't have to do it now.

2135
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:22,110
Oh, actually, I just noticed.

2136
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:23,650
Yeah, because we need to get the thing.

2137
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:25,350
Oh my god.

2138
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:26,770
Wait, this is gonna be hellish, no?

2139
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:29,270
This is...

2140
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:30,450
This is gonna be so hellish!

2141
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,520
Oh my god.

2142
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,700
I hate everything.

2143
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,140
You got this, Gammer.

2144
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:46,620
Where?

2145
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:47,660
Where?

2146
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:49,740
Where?

2147
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:50,540
Oh, ew.

2148
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,020
Uh-oh.

2149
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,020
I'm reloading.

2150
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:00,520
Please.

2151
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:01,660
Sir, understand.

2152
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,580
There we go.

2153
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:04,540
Okay.

2154
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,480
There's health here.

2155
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:10,960
Okay.

2156
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,540
The thrill of reloading in battle!

2157
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:17,900
Power generator track control.

2158
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,960
15 HP.

2159
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,620
More than enough to kill it.

2160
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,320
Oh.

2161
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:30,100
Oh.

2162
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,580
Yay!

2163
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:40,820
Yay!

2164
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,020
What's this do?

2165
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:45,580
Oh.

2166
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:49,260
I'm trying to...

2167
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:50,280
I'm trying to open the door.

2168
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,880
There we go.

2169
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,060
Alright.

2170
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:54,460
Ooh.

2171
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,440
Warning.

2172
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,620
Hazard this waste.

2173
01:36:58,980 --> 01:36:59,220
Oh, okay.

2174
01:36:59,340 --> 01:36:59,960
That...

2175
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,820
Opens and closes it.

2176
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:04,320
Wow.

2177
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,620
It's so pretty.

2178
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,860
You would not believe your eyes.

2179
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:11,440
10 million fireflies.

2180
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,560
Ah!

2181
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,200
Ah!

2182
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,840
No.

2183
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:15,700
No.

2184
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:16,340
No.

2185
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:17,740
No.

2186
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:18,660
No.

2187
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,100
No.

2188
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:19,660
No.

2189
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,220
Let's go!

2190
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,740
Well, whatever was up there is...

2191
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:27,760
Dead now?

2192
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:36,270
Let's go!

2193
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:43,270
Yeah, move in!

2194
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:43,770
Move in!

2195
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:45,670
Move in!

2196
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:47,590
Let's go!

2197
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:48,490
Move in!

2198
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:49,090
Oh.

2199
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:53,110
Move in!

2200
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:55,310
Why did he explode?

2201
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:02,720
Okay.

2202
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,180
Alright.

2203
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:03,680
Alright.

2204
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:04,700
I just gotta...

2205
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,040
I just gotta go for it.

2206
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:15,830
I

2207
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:21,680
just gotta go for it.

2208
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:22,360
Let's go!

2209
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,740
Okay.

2210
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:29,500
Alright.

2211
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,460
Uh...

2212
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:31,160
Shoddy, baby.

2213
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,160
Yeah, that never happened.

2214
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,720
Never happened.

2215
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,240
There we go!

2216
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,900
Wait, there's a second one.

2217
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,000
Oh no, that's a radio.

2218
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:50,540
Ah!

2219
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:52,620
No!

2220
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:53,920
You bastard!

2221
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:01,680
Anyway.

2222
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,180
Back to me trying to heal.

2223
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:06,500
Okay.

2224
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:07,760
Oof.

2225
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:12,410
I've got a crowbar.

2226
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:15,210
I'm really not afraid to use it.

2227
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:18,330
In fact, I would be happy to do so.

2228
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,050
What is this though?

2229
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:22,370
What is this though?

2230
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:22,670
Wait, hold on.

2231
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:23,970
I'm trying to destroy these first.

2232
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,710
What are you?

2233
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,730
Shut up!

2234
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:35,750
You're annoying.

2235
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:38,650
Um...

2236
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:40,850
I hope I didn't need whatever that was.

2237
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:42,910
As I think about it.

2238
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,070
Whatever the maintenance...

2239
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,710
Things were.

2240
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:48,570
It's...

2241
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:49,190
Fine.

2242
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:51,010
Okay.

2243
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:51,450
Okay.

2244
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:51,470
Alright.

2245
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:52,410
I've collected everything.

2246
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:53,790
Collected everything.

2247
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:54,250
We can...

2248
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:54,690
Now...

2249
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:55,150
I've saved.

2250
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:55,730
We can go.

2251
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,710
Doesn't save.

2252
01:40:01,810 --> 01:40:02,850
Thank you!

2253
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,500
You ready to kick some soldier ass?

2254
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:13,820
Where are they?

2255
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,160
Squad!

2256
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,720
Good job clearing blast pit, by the way.

2257
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,800
That area is super tricky.

2258
01:40:21,980 --> 01:40:22,440
Oh, thank you!

2259
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,840
Where are they?

2260
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,020
Ouch!

2261
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:41,860
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie!

2262
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,740
Wait, where'd you come from?

2263
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,380
Where did you come from, for real?

2264
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:47,540
You...

2265
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:48,780
Son of a gun.

2266
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:49,980
Oh, wait.

2267
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,120
I'm back where I came from.

2268
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:55,820
Um...

2269
01:40:55,820 --> 01:40:56,280
Dang it.

2270
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,100
That guy got me.

2271
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,500
That guy got me good.

2272
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,100
I'm dead.

2273
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:10,800
Okay, I'm going up.

2274
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,120
Ugh.

2275
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,020
I'm so dead.

2276
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:22,840
Ugh.

2277
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:27,590
Ugh.

2278
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:29,110
I'm so dead.

2279
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:29,910
Reload.

2280
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:32,170
Oh, wait.

2281
01:41:32,370 --> 01:41:33,090
Oh, yes.

2282
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:33,230
This...

2283
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,090
This is where I reloaded.

2284
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:34,350
Okay.

2285
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:35,190
I'm...

2286
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:35,550
I'm okay.

2287
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:35,870
I'm okay.

2288
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:36,130
I'm okay.

2289
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:36,550
I'm okay.

2290
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:37,150
This is fine.

2291
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:37,670
This is fine.

2292
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,710
You could use the laser mines here.

2293
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:43,010
Okay.

2294
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:43,990
Save.

2295
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:45,490
Okay.

2296
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:48,130
The thrill of reloading in battle.

2297
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,070
I don't think I get it.

2298
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:49,150
I get it.

2299
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:50,010
Hossalaad, I don't...

2300
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:50,950
I don't understand you.

2301
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:52,810
Hossalaad, I don't think I get it.

2302
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:54,090
I don't think I understand.

2303
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,810
I don't think I understand.

2304
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,310
I don't think I understand it.

2305
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:13,650
Okay.

2306
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:17,880
What was that?

2307
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:22,120
Okay.

2308
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,000
Save.

2309
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:23,880
All right.

2310
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:25,080
And...

2311
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:25,560
Reload.

2312
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,180
Yes, thank you.

2313
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:26,580
Ah!

2314
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,540
Oh my gosh.

2315
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:46,800
Ouch.

2316
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:51,690
Leave me alone.

2317
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:54,210
Where'd you go?

2318
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:54,570
Oh.

2319
01:42:56,330 --> 01:42:59,410
Oh wait, I don't... Maybe I'll switch to this instead.

2320
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,330
Oh my god.

2321
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:02,230
I

2322
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:07,850
did not notice what the heck that was.

2323
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:09,870
Ow, why is there a headcrab here too?

2324
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:13,950
Oh my gosh, there's so many guys here.

2325
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:15,710
Go away.

2326
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:20,450
Why aren't they infected?

2327
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,170
Why are they infected with headcrab?

2328
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:31,560
You bastard, please let me shoot you.

2329
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:35,680
That was not great.

2330
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,320
Oh my god.

2331
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:42,000
Still... Oh my god.

2332
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:42,720
Wait.

2333
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,640
Spoilers, is it because they're with the Mr. G-Man?

2334
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:57,900
Oh.

2335
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,400
I hope they're doing that to themselves.

2336
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:03,920
Nice health.

2337
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:10,260
Did they blow themselves up or...

2338
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:19,740
Oh.

2339
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,040
That doesn't look good.

2340
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,320
Okay.

2341
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:25,680
Alright.

2342
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,000
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2343
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:36,270
Ouch.

2344
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:37,150
Wait.

2345
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:39,070
That took so much of my health.

2346
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:44,180
No.

2347
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,780
That sucks.

2348
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,780
Did so much damage.

2349
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,740
I just wanted to break it.

2350
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:55,820
Power generator down here.

2351
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:56,060
Okay.

2352
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:56,340
Hold on.

2353
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:58,140
Let's walk... Look around a little bit first.

2354
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:00,960
Because... This exists.

2355
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:04,240
Ah.

2356
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:07,900
Took like half my... It took... Half...

2357
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:10,440
Of my life!

2358
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:12,780
Nice.

2359
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,000
Okay.

2360
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,440
AI Marine is pretty advanced.

2361
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,100
They actively flank you and try to draw you out of cover.

2362
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:19,880
They... Yeah.

2363
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,580
They seem pretty smart.

2364
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,300
I don't think I like that.

2365
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:33,040
Oh, there's another one.

2366
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:34,060
Ugh.

2367
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:37,880
Wait.

2368
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:39,340
I've learned my lesson.

2369
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,020
What is...

2370
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:43,520
Wait!

2371
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,300
What's going on in here?

2372
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:45,980
Can I stop?

2373
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:46,380
Wait.

2374
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,420
Maybe if I jump over.

2375
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:52,420
Yeah!

2376
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:53,400
Yeah!

2377
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:54,980
I'm gonna take his gun.

2378
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:56,180
Oh!

2379
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:56,520
Ouch!

2380
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,360
Okay.

2381
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,100
I can't take the gun.

2382
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,300
I tried.

2383
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,680
Where the hell are we?

2384
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:10,760
Okay.

2385
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,020
Oh!

2386
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:11,560
Is this...

2387
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,280
The other side?

2388
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:18,500
Um...

2389
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:25,270
Oh, I can't take that.

2390
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:25,510
Okay.

2391
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:28,790
Okie dokie!

2392
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:30,150
Okie dokie!

2393
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:32,790
Okie dokie.

2394
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:35,010
Okie dokie.

2395
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:40,030
I think we can go down now.

2396
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:43,090
Ugh.

2397
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:44,910
Hit it with the crowbar.

2398
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:45,590
What?

2399
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:45,970
Hit what?

2400
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:47,150
The one that expl...

2401
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:48,510
The one that says explosives?

2402
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:53,990
The one that said explosives?

2403
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:56,090
Guys, what is wrong with you?

2404
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:04,540
Oh.

2405
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:05,540
Oh!

2406
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:10,360
I need you to come back, please.

2407
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,820
I need to...

2408
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:18,560
What?

2409
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,180
Okay!

2410
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,040
Peace and quiet.

2411
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:23,940
Oh.

2412
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,660
Oh...

2413
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,720
I'm playing...

2414
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,600
Mission Impossible right now.

2415
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,300
Wait, can I...

2416
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,280
Blow this up myself?

2417
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,060
Oh.

2418
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,140
Yes.

2419
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:55,110
Anyway, um...

2420
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:55,450
Ah!

2421
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:06,540
Third time's the charm, I suppose.

2422
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,960
Oh no.

2423
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:10,560
No, god.

2424
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:10,620
Whyt?

2425
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:21,700
Whyt?

2426
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:24,080
I know...

2427
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,020
Little dogs!

2428
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:25,580
Please!

2429
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,440
Little dogs, NO!

2430
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:39,190
Okay, little dog.

2431
01:48:39,450 --> 01:48:40,870
Little dog, don't do it.

2432
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:44,290
Don't do it.

2433
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,630
I lived.

2434
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:47,510
Wait.

2435
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:50,090
What?

2436
01:48:57,910 --> 01:48:58,610
Wait.

2437
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:03,090
I mean, we're gonna have to come back up.

2438
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:15,380
Anything over there?

2439
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,540
Not anymore.

2440
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:21,900
You, in my existence.

2441
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,920
I know there's more.

2442
01:49:27,180 --> 01:49:27,840
I saw him.

2443
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:31,640
Any more?

2444
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:32,180
Yes.

2445
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:33,180
Yes.

2446
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:39,380
At first, if you don't succeed, try and try and try and try again.

2447
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:41,560
He gave his honor... Wait.

2448
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:42,800
His life, not for honor.

2449
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:47,100
He didn't even... He didn't even give it for me, either.

2450
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:56,200
I think I heard another pup.

2451
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,880
100% heard another pup.

2452
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,940
I don't know where he is.

2453
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:17,870
Look at him just coming on.

2454
01:50:18,110 --> 01:50:19,330
He's just coming his way.

2455
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:19,930
He's just...

2456
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:20,890
Taking his time.

2457
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,610
Oh, he's so cute.

2458
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:28,910
Just waddling along.

2459
01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:30,850
Maintenance area.

2460
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:34,850
Okay.

2461
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:37,450
I have to be wary, I believe.

2462
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:43,530
Nice.

2463
01:50:46,690 --> 01:50:48,170
Is there someone else in here?

2464
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:50,070
Okay.

2465
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:52,070
There's a lot to explore around this area.

2466
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:58,970
Let's go down some more.

2467
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:03,370
See where this leads to.

2468
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:04,810
Oh.

2469
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:06,090
Oh.

2470
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:07,570
What is that?

2471
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:11,770
It was a... It was a... Oh gosh, they're like leeches.

2472
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:15,170
There's leeches in the water!

2473
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:17,090
Wait, are they actually leeches?

2474
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:24,770
Free tapeworm?

2475
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:25,850
Nasty.

2476
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:30,250
I think they are fish.

2477
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:34,920
What?

2478
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:35,580
What's happening?

2479
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:37,660
Hold on.

2480
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:38,340
Save.

2481
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:39,800
New save.

2482
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:40,480
Nice.

2483
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:40,740
Okay.

2484
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:43,040
Maybe we'll see if they start hurting us.

2485
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:43,780
I'm at 60...

2486
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:49,560
Where is he?

2487
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,220
He's like, I don't want to get out of my bath!

2488
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:53,760
Oh my god.

2489
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:54,880
You're powerful.

2490
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:03,880
Ugh!

2491
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,640
So far...

2492
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,800
They're not hurt...

2493
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,500
Whoa, this guy is like, actually flying.

2494
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,000
Can I kill him?

2495
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,060
Wait, let me try with my crowbar.

2496
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:15,460
Oh!

2497
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,300
What?

2498
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:19,120
How did that kill me?

2499
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:20,180
How did that hurt me?

2500
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:25,210
Oh!

2501
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:26,090
Okay.

2502
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,700
Maybe they are bad.

2503
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:36,640
They...

2504
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,000
They...

2505
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:37,300
They take...

2506
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,300
They are hardy though.

2507
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:39,840
These guys take a hit.

2508
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:41,060
Do you hear this?

2509
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:42,580
Whack, whack, whack, whack.

2510
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:44,020
Whack, whack, whack, whack.

2511
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:46,160
Whack, whack, whack.

2512
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,220
These guys are so thick!

2513
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:48,260
Whack.

2514
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:54,100
Whack.

2515
01:52:59,400 --> 01:52:59,480
Oh!

2516
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:00,380
More!

2517
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:01,040
You!

2518
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:02,380
Ah!

2519
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,700
Oh, it drained the s...

2520
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:08,860
It drained the room!

2521
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:09,700
It drained all the...

2522
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:10,900
Stupid leeches!

2523
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:16,540
What do you mean I have no helmet?

2524
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,220
Am I supposed to?

2525
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:27,990
Can I go through here now?

2526
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:33,050
Oh, it got on my face when you crouched.

2527
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:33,550
Ah!

2528
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:34,590
I see, I see.

2529
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:37,850
And run!

2530
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:39,090
No, no, no, no.

2531
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,120
Green.

2532
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:55,790
Run!

2533
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:57,830
Okay.

2534
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:58,850
Very nice.

2535
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:04,190
So...

2536
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:06,350
I turned on the power.

2537
01:54:08,730 --> 01:54:11,370
So now we can get the guy going.

2538
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:12,850
The little...

2539
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,290
Our little...

2540
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:15,410
Car.

2541
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:16,530
I suppose.

2542
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:19,470
The fan.

2543
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:24,240
Oh my god.

2544
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:25,960
No.

2545
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:27,100
The guys are back.

2546
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:29,860
No, I hear them.

2547
01:54:31,980 --> 01:54:33,660
I did save, I just saved.

2548
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:40,850
Over.

2549
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:48,400
I'm saving again.

2550
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,040
Because I'm scared.

2551
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:57,880
Wait, they're coming from the other side.

2552
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:07,510
Yeah!

2553
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:08,890
I wasn't moving!

2554
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:12,110
Oh my god.

2555
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:12,430
Wait.

2556
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:13,670
Stupid.

2557
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:21,740
They're strong.

2558
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:22,920
Oh no, I'm reloading.

2559
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:23,480
Wait.

2560
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:26,180
Wait, I also have grenade.

2561
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:26,620
Wait.

2562
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:27,140
Oh wait.

2563
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:27,680
This thing.

2564
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:52,180
But this would be the perfect time to use you.

2565
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:52,600
Okay.

2566
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:54,460
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put it down.

2567
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:56,740
Um...

2568
01:56:07,370 --> 01:56:08,430
Put it on the wall?

2569
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:08,830
Oh.

2570
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:09,770
They'll blow up.

2571
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:12,030
Probably.

2572
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:23,240
I panicked, guys!

2573
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,480
I put it on the floor!

2574
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,120
I panicked!

2575
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:32,430
Mister?

2576
01:56:33,950 --> 01:56:34,930
Hey mister?

2577
01:56:38,650 --> 01:56:39,330
Mister?

2578
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:43,390
I think I messed up.

2579
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:45,610
Shoot?

2580
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:46,770
Oh, they'll hear it?

2581
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:50,790
They did not hear it.

2582
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:52,050
Wait.

2583
01:56:52,470 --> 01:56:52,850
There we go.

2584
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:03,830
Just walk past it.

2585
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:07,930
I'm dancing.

2586
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:09,470
Where are they?

2587
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:11,830
Wait.

2588
01:57:11,830 --> 01:57:11,870
Wait.

2589
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:13,570
Oh, I think they haven't come down yet.

2590
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:15,510
Hello?

2591
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:16,530
Wait.

2592
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:22,080
Why haven't...

2593
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:27,340
Oh, I think they have to finish their little dialogue first, no?

2594
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:32,560
They went back out?!

2595
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:36,100
They only come down once.

2596
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:39,800
Wait, hold on.

2597
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:40,260
I'm gonna...

2598
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:41,020
I'm gonna restart.

2599
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,100
Okay.

2600
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:43,180
Okay.

2601
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,820
Alright, let's...

2602
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:46,620
Let's try this again.

2603
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:54,520
Oh, wait.

2604
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:20,770
Okay.

2605
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:22,390
Okay.

2606
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:24,050
Oh, be careful.

2607
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,890
My turn!

2608
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:30,350
Greetings, free...

2609
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:34,580
Free Mint.

2610
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,400
It is my birthday!

2611
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:35,900
Shows!

2612
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:37,460
Hold on.

2613
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:56,260
Happy birthday to you!

2614
01:58:57,260 --> 01:59:00,820
Happy birthday to you!

2615
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:04,940
Happy birthday, dear Shows!

2616
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:10,720
Happy birthday to you!

2617
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:15,520
Okay.

2618
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:16,640
Six shots.

2619
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:16,700
What?

2620
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,100
I've got six shots.

2621
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,320
And no armor.

2622
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,000
And no...

2623
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:22,340
No.

2624
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,550
Oh.

2625
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,330
There he is.

2626
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:44,780
Why did he explode?!

2627
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:52,600
Um...

2628
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:53,720
I have three health.

2629
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,080
Three HP in a dream?

2630
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:01,180
I just keep saving.

2631
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:02,140
I just keep saving.

2632
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,640
I just keep saving.

2633
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:07,380
If I am an...

2634
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,000
Oh god, I hear him.

2635
02:00:17,670 --> 02:00:18,470
What is...

2636
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:20,330
What would be the best gun to use, you guys?

2637
02:00:20,450 --> 02:00:20,890
What do you think?

2638
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:22,770
Maybe this one?

2639
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:24,130
Cause it's like...

2640
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:25,070
Pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew?

2641
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:33,260
Sky.

2642
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:36,040
Send your shotgun again.

2643
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:36,280
Okay.

2644
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:43,340
Okay.

2645
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:44,600
Well, we're done with the...

2646
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:45,200
Men for now.

2647
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:45,560
Maybe.

2648
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:49,100
I don't know why...

2649
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:49,760
Wait.

2650
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,280
Oh yeah.

2651
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,640
This is where they first came out.

2652
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:52,780
Okay.

2653
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:53,980
Alright.

2654
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:03,100
What does this do?

2655
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:04,160
Oh, this opens the door.

2656
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:04,520
That's right.

2657
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,040
Smush the bug.

2658
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:10,100
And I'll do it again.

2659
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:16,570
Alrighty.

2660
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:17,730
Alrighty.

2661
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:17,830
Alrighty.

2662
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:22,490
Okay.

2663
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:29,650
The SMG is the most hated weapon.

2664
02:01:29,890 --> 02:01:31,750
They only use it for the grenade launcher.

2665
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:32,610
It has.

2666
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:33,670
Oh, how do you...

2667
02:01:33,670 --> 02:01:34,690
How do you use that though?

2668
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:37,690
Is that what the little six is down there?

2669
02:01:39,390 --> 02:01:41,530
Oh, if you right click, it will fire the grenade.

2670
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:42,470
Oh, okay, okay.

2671
02:01:42,610 --> 02:01:42,930
Cool, cool.

2672
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:43,350
Thank you.

2673
02:01:44,170 --> 02:01:45,390
I'm just gonna save again.

2674
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:45,810
Sorry.

2675
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:52,840
Okay.

2676
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,020
Okay.

2677
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:55,140
So now...

2678
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,040
Are you still alive?

2679
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:58,900
Oh my God, he really is.

2680
02:01:59,080 --> 02:01:59,940
He's holding on.

2681
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:01,160
I'm never gonna make it.

2682
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:01,580
Oh.

2683
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,440
Yes you are.

2684
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:03,540
You better go on without me.

2685
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:03,860
No!

2686
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:04,020
Oh!

2687
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,280
Okay.

2688
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,320
You missed some revolver ammo down the ladder.

2689
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:12,520
Which...

2690
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:13,540
ladder?

2691
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:14,920
Oh.

2692
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:20,260
Well, I don't have to go down the ladder anymore.

2693
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:23,940
This one?

2694
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,520
Ah!

2695
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:26,460
Thank you.

2696
02:02:29,740 --> 02:02:30,340
Okay.

2697
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,220
So now...

2698
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,120
Um, wait.

2699
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:36,540
How...

2700
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:37,340
Do I...

2701
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:38,540
How do I do this?

2702
02:02:40,740 --> 02:02:41,980
Weakest knees ever.

2703
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:44,260
I mean, my guy is at three HP.

2704
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:45,120
I think...

2705
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,560
I think he has an excuse.

2706
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,440
It's gonna be very tough with three HP.

2707
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,380
Yeah, probably.

2708
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:02,660
How many times a year do you think I could claim it to be my birthday before mint notices?

2709
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:04,380
Please don't do that.

2710
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:05,640
Please don't do that.

2711
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:05,800
I...

2712
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:07,120
I go by otter system.

2713
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:09,880
There's no way that I can remember everybody's birthday.

2714
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:12,100
So please don't...

2715
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:14,320
Even have that cross your mind.

2716
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:15,580
Yeah, don't abuse it.

2717
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:15,960
Please.

2718
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:20,860
Because I will stop singing for people.

2719
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:21,380
And I...

2720
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,280
You know, I don't mind singing for people.

2721
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:25,120
I like it.

2722
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:26,360
I think it's a lot of fun.

2723
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:28,460
But...

2724
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,280
Yeah.

2725
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,560
I feel like...

2726
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:33,340
I feel...

2727
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:33,720
I...

2728
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,060
I...

2729
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:34,860
I don't even...

2730
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:35,280
I...

2731
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,680
I don't even want to think of that thought.

2732
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,260
How can we do this, guys?

2733
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:48,880
How do I go back down?

2734
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:52,400
Because the entrance was blocked.

2735
02:03:57,260 --> 02:03:58,220
Don't say that.

2736
02:03:58,880 --> 02:03:59,580
Don't say that.

2737
02:03:59,580 --> 02:03:59,680
Don't say that.

2738
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:03,740
Ugh.

2739
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:11,590
What is it?

2740
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:12,250
Weak ass?

2741
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:13,010
Is that what he's saying?

2742
02:04:13,570 --> 02:04:14,450
Jump across.

2743
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:15,890
Wait, jump like here?

2744
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:26,790
The bridge that collapsed just outside.

2745
02:04:27,790 --> 02:04:28,630
Wait, where?

2746
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:29,810
Oh, here!

2747
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:30,630
Oh, I see.

2748
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:31,030
Thank you.

2749
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:34,030
Ah, ah, ah.

2750
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:34,650
Thank you, thank you.

2751
02:04:35,390 --> 02:04:36,810
I completely missed it.

2752
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:37,530
Okay.

2753
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:39,490
I was like, jump across!

2754
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:40,670
Eek!

2755
02:04:40,910 --> 02:04:41,070
Ah!

2756
02:04:41,570 --> 02:04:41,910
Ah!

2757
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:56,020
Oopsie!

2758
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:57,660
Oopsie!

2759
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,500
I panicked.

2760
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:03,400
I might have panicked a little bit.

2761
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,780
I might have panicked.

2762
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:06,640
Just like a tad.

2763
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:09,220
Good thing she didn't panic.

2764
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:19,890
To be fair, you have like 3 HP.

2765
02:05:20,530 --> 02:05:21,070
Yeah.

2766
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:24,330
I think I have a reason to panic.

2767
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:28,710
He's not gonna notice me, is he?

2768
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:33,750
Do I hear any more sounds?

2769
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:34,510
Whoa!

2770
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:35,350
Oh!

2771
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:35,830
Okay.

2772
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:36,830
That's where that is.

2773
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:37,210
Okay.

2774
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:38,450
Alright.

2775
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:40,650
Hmm.

2776
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:42,730
Hey mister!

2777
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:47,830
Oh, come on.

2778
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:49,410
This sucks.

2779
02:05:53,540 --> 02:05:54,540
Cheese him.

2780
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:55,140
Okay.

2781
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:57,380
Guys.

2782
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,440
3 HP!

2783
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:05,660
Oh!

2784
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:06,960
That's how that works.

2785
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:09,380
It like, does not shoot very far at all.

2786
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:10,040
Got it.

2787
02:06:11,860 --> 02:06:12,420
Cool.

2788
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:17,180
Do these even do damage to him?

2789
02:06:24,390 --> 02:06:24,870
Or...

2790
02:06:40,730 --> 02:06:41,570
3 HP.

2791
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:42,810
Half-Life 3 confirmed.

2792
02:06:44,170 --> 02:06:44,650
Okay.

2793
02:06:45,010 --> 02:06:46,970
I'm not gonna be your savior, buddy.

2794
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:49,850
Don't put all that pressure on me.

2795
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:50,970
Wait, I think he...

2796
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:57,830
Has a moment after he does this where he like, kind of like...

2797
02:06:59,330 --> 02:06:59,810
Okay.

2798
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:00,690
Do the stomp.

2799
02:07:01,550 --> 02:07:02,390
She stomp.

2800
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:03,210
She stomp.

2801
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:04,670
She do another stomp.

2802
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:05,850
Then once this explodes...

2803
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:08,450
Then he like, shakes his head.

2804
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:14,310
Never mind.

2805
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,600
Can I shoot him in like, the face?

2806
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:32,040
He's like, shaking his head like, no, you cannot do that.

2807
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,520
Go while the stomp is...

2808
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:35,880
Charging.

2809
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:41,220
Come on.

2810
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:58,160
Go left.

2811
02:08:08,510 --> 02:08:10,010
Distract him from the other window?

2812
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:10,670
Let's try.

2813
02:08:11,690 --> 02:08:11,870
Oh!

2814
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:16,790
I'm dead.

2815
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:18,450
Oh!

2816
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:19,930
I forgot to pick up this ammo.

2817
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:26,060
Oh, wait.

2818
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,860
I don't think I can get down, you guys.

2819
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:28,320
I'll die.

2820
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:36,350
This is probably the worst situation ever.

2821
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:37,570
Jump to the ladder.

2822
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:38,070
Okay, okay.

2823
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:40,690
This is the worst situation ever you could be in.

2824
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:42,070
Oh!

2825
02:08:42,370 --> 02:08:42,450
Oh!

2826
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:44,070
I was so close.

2827
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:52,240
I'm not soft-locked because I have saves.

2828
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,400
So we'll be okay.

2829
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:55,680
But, you know.

2830
02:08:57,440 --> 02:08:58,900
I'm never gonna make it.

2831
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:01,320
You better go on without me.

2832
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:01,640
Okay.

2833
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:03,300
All right.

2834
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:04,580
I am...

2835
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:05,380
I'm gonna go on.

2836
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:05,720
Sorry.

2837
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:07,460
Okay.

2838
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:26,040
Guys, I might have to just...

2839
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:26,220
Hey!

2840
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:27,840
Hey, big buddy!

2841
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:29,340
Yeah, I'm going.

2842
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:30,680
All right.

2843
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:31,200
The bridge!

2844
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:32,000
Oh, thank you, thank you.

2845
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,580
Well, I was gonna get the ammo, but...

2846
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:34,560
Yeah, I think it's just...

2847
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:35,560
Because there's ammo down there.

2848
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:36,740
But I think it's just better...

2849
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:38,060
Safer to maybe go with the bridge.

2850
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:38,880
Huh?

2851
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:39,900
Yeah.

2852
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:56,280
Ugh!

2853
02:09:58,620 --> 02:09:59,620
Wrong tunnel?

2854
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:01,780
Wait, what do you mean wrong tunnel?

2855
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:03,340
Don't I need to go to the thing?

2856
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:05,100
To the cart?

2857
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,700
I need to go to the left tunnel?

2858
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:08,900
Oh!

2859
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:09,460
Oops.

2860
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:11,000
Wow.

2861
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,080
Wow!

2862
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:15,440
Okay, well that...

2863
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:15,840
Works.

2864
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:16,400
Nevermind.

2865
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:35,590
This is so stupid.

2866
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:57,580
Oh, you gotta keep running!

2867
02:10:58,540 --> 02:10:58,780
Oh!

2868
02:10:59,740 --> 02:10:59,780
Oh!

2869
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:06,420
I didn't know he would come after me.

2870
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:07,080
Okay.

2871
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:07,900
Sorry, guys.

2872
02:11:08,060 --> 02:11:08,700
I should've saved.

2873
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:09,580
I'm so stupid.

2874
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,240
It's fine though.

2875
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:11,900
It's fine.

2876
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:13,980
Come here!

2877
02:11:13,980 --> 02:11:15,480
We were gonna make it.

2878
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:17,120
Yeah, we got the 2 HP back.

2879
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:17,780
Such a...

2880
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:18,140
Okay.

2881
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:19,740
Oi!

2882
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:21,080
Alright.

2883
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:22,780
So I just gotta keep running?

2884
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:25,500
Alright.

2885
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:30,820
I saved!

2886
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:32,540
Run, run, run.

2887
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:33,040
Run,

2888
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:37,380
run, run, run.

2889
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:38,780
Get in the door.

2890
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:49,370
There's a health pack.

2891
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:50,570
Yeah, I saw the switch.

2892
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:52,750
But he's camping now.

2893
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:55,510
This is the Minto content.

2894
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:57,470
We're playing on actual hard mode.

2895
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:05,590
I see the switch over there.

2896
02:12:17,240 --> 02:12:18,020
Shit, shit, shit.

2897
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:23,100
Okay, I'm gonna...

2898
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:28,100
Okay, now that I know what it looks like in there, I'm gonna try and get the...

2899
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,020
Try for the...

2900
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:32,060
Oh sh...

2901
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:32,920
I wasted too much time.

2902
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:33,940
There we go.

2903
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:34,140
Okay.

2904
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:36,620
I'm gonna try for the switch first, maybe.

2905
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:40,680
Beeline to the console, pretty much.

2906
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:42,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2907
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:43,860
Switch first.

2908
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:49,750
See him?

2909
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,760
What's going on out there?

2910
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:10,520
I got him?

2911
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:11,340
Whoa!

2912
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:18,610
And I didn't even...

2913
02:13:18,610 --> 02:13:19,250
I couldn't...

2914
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:20,630
I didn't even know it.

2915
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,180
I died to electricity.

2916
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:41,400
I think...

2917
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:43,200
Careful of the rail.

2918
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:48,080
I think everything's a little charged right now.

2919
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:50,320
Okay.

2920
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:53,580
Go?

2921
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:54,860
Oh, there we go.

2922
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:01,500
Wait, I'm scared that the guys are gonna come back, though.

2923
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:02,380
Oh, shoot.

2924
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:02,820
No, no.

2925
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,180
There's health in here?

2926
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:15,060
There is?

2927
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:16,520
I tried...

2928
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,240
Trying to find it, but I couldn't see it.

2929
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:21,200
Ooh, what was that?

2930
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,320
The boxes.

2931
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:29,000
These?

2932
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:29,940
Can I...

2933
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:31,700
Walk on this, or will I die?

2934
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:39,760
That's why you're the best, boss.

2935
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:47,900
Corner by the lever.

2936
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:48,700
Thank you!

2937
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:51,480
Oh, I see it!

2938
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:55,000
Oh, my...

2939
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:55,980
Oh!

2940
02:14:58,800 --> 02:14:59,200
Holy...

2941
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:00,100
Let's go.

2942
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:02,420
Oh, yeah, baby!

2943
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:03,000
Thank you, guys.

2944
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:04,140
I didn't even see that at all.

2945
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,080
I thought...

2946
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:07,420
I saw some people saying that there was health in there.

2947
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:10,280
But I thought they were saying it was like one of the wall packs.

2948
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:11,800
One of the wall thingies.

2949
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:13,200
And so I, uh...

2950
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,280
I was like, I don't...

2951
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:17,300
I was like, I don't see it.

2952
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:20,440
You still alive?

2953
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,340
He's still kicking.

2954
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:29,200
Alright!

2955
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:43,700
I was like...

2956
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:43,940
...

2957
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:44,300
save.

2958
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:45,740
And...

2959
02:15:45,740 --> 02:15:46,000
...

2960
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:46,180
...

2961
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:46,500
...

2962
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:49,220
Top speed!

2963
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,640
Oh, uh...

2964
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:55,140
Wow.

2965
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:56,280
Sturdy.

2966
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:03,620
Oh...

2967
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:08,570
Freeman, I've been waiting for you.

2968
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:09,070
You have?

2969
02:16:09,130 --> 02:16:11,130
One of your scientist pals said to give you a message.

2970
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:16,070
You're supposed to take this old rail system up to some kind of satellite delivery rocket.

2971
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:21,210
I don't know where it is exactly, and the old guy was so worried about getting out of here alive, he didn't tell me.

2972
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:29,090
Main thing is, the military aborted the launch, so when you do find the rocket, you'll have to get up to the control room and launch it yourself.

2973
02:16:29,310 --> 02:16:29,550
Oh!

2974
02:16:29,670 --> 02:16:35,030
He said something about a Lambda team needing the satellite in orbit if they were ever gonna clean up this mess.

2975
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:37,930
I'm a rocket scientist now.

2976
02:16:42,490 --> 02:16:42,970
What?

2977
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:44,790
Take a little damage, but I can make it.

2978
02:16:44,850 --> 02:16:46,050
Did you just...

2979
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:48,810
But, I can't take much more of this.

2980
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:49,070
Wait!

2981
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:50,270
Get off, Bernie!

2982
02:16:50,550 --> 02:16:52,030
Get off the rail!

2983
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,810
I mean, Barney.

2984
02:16:54,330 --> 02:16:55,930
Fucking... I can't remember your name.

2985
02:16:56,670 --> 02:16:57,630
Barney, no!

2986
02:16:58,790 --> 02:16:59,270
No!

2987
02:17:06,050 --> 02:17:06,530
No!

2988
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:07,190
He's li... No!

2989
02:17:07,430 --> 02:17:08,190
I can't move!

2990
02:17:08,690 --> 02:17:09,130
Get off!

2991
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:14,380
Come here.

2992
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:16,200
Come here.

2993
02:17:16,380 --> 02:17:17,340
Okay, why not?

2994
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:17,860
Come here.

2995
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:18,420
I don't wanna die...

2996
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:19,780
No!

2997
02:17:19,780 --> 02:17:19,920
Oh!

2998
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:29,980
Why didn't you do anything?

2999
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:53,960
He was like, I took a little damage, but I'm okay.

3000
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:55,100
And then...

3001
02:17:57,930 --> 02:18:01,090
He lasted for his cutscene, and then he died!

3002
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,420
We'll go in slow motion.

3003
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:15,180
We'll go in slow.

3004
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,440
Where is it?

3005
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:23,900
Wait, oh!

3006
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:27,420
What just happened?

3007
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:28,900
Wait, how did I die?

3008
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:30,440
How did I die?

3009
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:48,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3010
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:48,040
Wait.

3011
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:49,700
Okay.

3012
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:52,040
Freeman, I've been waiting for you.

3013
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:54,620
One of your scientist pals said to give you a message.

3014
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:59,460
You're supposed to take this old rail system up to some kind of satellite delivery problem.

3015
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:04,560
I don't know where it is exactly, and the old guy was so worried about getting out of here alive, he didn't tell me.

3016
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:09,880
Don't worry about it!

3017
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,960
Don't worry about it!

3018
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:13,980
What?

3019
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:19,380
Okay, he'll live now.

3020
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:20,000
He'll live.

3021
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,000
He'll live now.

3022
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:24,780
He'll live.

3023
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:27,360
Okay.

3024
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:29,080
Let's see.

3025
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:34,760
Let's see.

3026
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,240
I have to see this.

3027
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:42,400
Okay.

3028
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:45,500
Oh, why am I dying?

3029
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:46,160
Why am I hurting?

3030
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:46,820
Why am I hurting?

3031
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:47,640
Why am I hurting?

3032
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:48,420
Why am I hurting?

3033
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:49,120
Wait, why am I hurting?

3034
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:50,400
Oh, I'm getting electrocuted!

3035
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:50,900
Oh!

3036
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:51,940
I didn't realize.

3037
02:19:58,620 --> 02:20:00,200
Freeman, I've been waiting for you.

3038
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,740
One of your scientists pals said to give you a message.

3039
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:07,580
You're supposed to take this old rail system up to some kind of satellite delivery rocket.

3040
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:08,960
I don't know where it is.

3041
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:12,640
Uh, okay.

3042
02:20:21,310 --> 02:20:21,750
Okay.

3043
02:20:22,750 --> 02:20:22,990
Okay.

3044
02:20:25,530 --> 02:20:26,370
Does this just...

3045
02:20:26,370 --> 02:20:27,350
Does it go in the water?

3046
02:20:27,490 --> 02:20:27,890
Oh, yeah.

3047
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:28,510
See, there we go.

3048
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:30,370
See?

3049
02:20:31,150 --> 02:20:31,930
We're fine!

3050
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:33,830
Everything's all fine.

3051
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:35,970
I'm taking it easy.

3052
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:37,330
Oh, never mind.

3053
02:20:37,330 --> 02:20:39,350
I'm still taking it easy.

3054
02:20:41,150 --> 02:20:42,430
What could be down here?

3055
02:20:43,150 --> 02:20:43,270
Oh!

3056
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:44,950
Electricity.

3057
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:46,550
Yeah, we know this is electric.

3058
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:49,910
We know.

3059
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:54,890
Do I crouch?

3060
02:20:56,410 --> 02:20:56,990
Oh!

3061
02:20:57,350 --> 02:20:57,650
Oh!

3062
02:20:59,010 --> 02:20:59,590
Okay.

3063
02:21:00,470 --> 02:21:02,050
Uh, how am I supposed to know?

3064
02:21:05,470 --> 02:21:06,050
Okay!

3065
02:21:08,330 --> 02:21:08,890
Save?

3066
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:14,040
What's that sound?

3067
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:15,660
That doesn't sound very good.

3068
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:17,020
That sounds quite spooky.

3069
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:18,600
What was that sound?

3070
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:22,880
I hear head crabs, I believe?

3071
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:26,660
This is so spooky!

3072
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:31,820
Those are ghosts?

3073
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:32,380
No!

3074
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,400
No way!

3075
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:38,160
They're screaming.

3076
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,340
Why is it so spooky?

3077
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:47,950
Oh, uh...

3078
02:21:47,950 --> 02:21:48,410
That's a...

3079
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:48,750
Wait.

3080
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:51,270
Oh.

3081
02:21:51,570 --> 02:21:52,490
Is that a dog?

3082
02:21:54,170 --> 02:21:54,910
Okay.

3083
02:21:54,910 --> 02:21:54,950
Okay.

3084
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:57,530
We're fine though.

3085
02:21:58,130 --> 02:21:58,810
We're fine though.

3086
02:21:58,810 --> 02:21:58,850
Right?

3087
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:02,430
Uh...

3088
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:02,950
What?

3089
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:03,710
What's happening?

3090
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:06,190
What's going on?

3091
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:11,800
Oh!

3092
02:22:12,220 --> 02:22:13,160
I missed my...

3093
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,140
I missed my...

3094
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:22,920
I was greedy!

3095
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:23,780
I was greedy!

3096
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,600
We're fine.

3097
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:28,260
Everything's okay.

3098
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:34,580
I hear the screams of the damned.

3099
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:41,580
Everything's fine?

3100
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:47,640
You could stop the train at any time.

3101
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:48,160
You know what?

3102
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:49,940
You are so right!

3103
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:58,760
Can I go backwards?

3104
02:22:59,200 --> 02:22:59,360
No.

3105
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:00,560
I can only go forwards.

3106
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:03,000
Worst Disneyland ride ever?

3107
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:04,100
What are you talking about?

3108
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:06,180
I'm really enjoying myself.

3109
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:06,680
Wait.

3110
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:07,060
You can.

3111
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:11,800
So if I go...

3112
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:14,780
No, no, no!

3113
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:15,120
Wait.

3114
02:23:16,460 --> 02:23:17,320
I don't...

3115
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:18,420
I think I can.

3116
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:19,780
But I would still...

3117
02:23:19,780 --> 02:23:22,240
I tried reversing, but it just stopped.

3118
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:23,640
Unless...

3119
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:25,380
Hold on.

3120
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:26,980
I'm gonna attempt...

3121
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:28,040
I'm going to attempt this.

3122
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:37,700
Ah!

3123
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:46,380
Okay, hold on.

3124
02:23:47,540 --> 02:23:50,120
I don't want this guy bothering me any...

3125
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,540
Any time in the future!

3126
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:55,540
Why?

3127
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:55,880
Why?

3128
02:23:59,140 --> 02:23:59,900
There we go.

3129
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:02,800
Gotta switch the track somewhere else.

3130
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:03,220
Oh?

3131
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:03,860
Okay.

3132
02:24:04,400 --> 02:24:05,860
We'll get these guys preemptively.

3133
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:10,840
I only have so much...

3134
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:12,940
So much ammo with the revolver left.

3135
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:13,740
So I don't wanna...

3136
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:16,160
Is he gonna come out?

3137
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:16,580
You know what?

3138
02:24:16,620 --> 02:24:16,900
Nevermind.

3139
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:18,080
Okay.

3140
02:24:22,060 --> 02:24:23,000
Okie dokie!

3141
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:27,120
And...

3142
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:27,880
Stop!

3143
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:33,040
15% Nice.

3144
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,040
Okay.

3145
02:24:35,660 --> 02:24:36,600
Continue onwards.

3146
02:24:37,240 --> 02:24:37,280
Oh.

3147
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:42,180
Six shots is all you need.

3148
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:45,460
Yeah, but I need the ammo for the six shots.

3149
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:47,180
I think.

3150
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,060
I think that's how that works.

3151
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,680
I think you like, get the ammo...

3152
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:53,220
And then you say, six shots.

3153
02:24:57,950 --> 02:24:58,970
Which way are we going?

3154
02:25:01,170 --> 02:25:02,210
Straight.

3155
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:03,050
Okay.

3156
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:07,110
What if...

3157
02:25:07,850 --> 02:25:09,090
What if I go here?

3158
02:25:11,590 --> 02:25:12,110
Oh.

3159
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:13,890
And I destroy these.

3160
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:22,470
Yippee!

3161
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:23,610
Okay.

3162
02:25:23,930 --> 02:25:24,810
That was worth it.

3163
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:27,750
That was worth?

3164
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:30,610
More revolver ammo?

3165
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:31,470
I have 15.

3166
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:46,690
There's your six shots.

3167
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:49,530
Oh.

3168
02:25:50,830 --> 02:25:52,250
That doesn't seem good.

3169
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:53,390
Oh.

3170
02:25:57,490 --> 02:25:57,890
Wait.

3171
02:25:57,890 --> 02:25:57,930
Wait.

3172
02:25:59,270 --> 02:26:00,730
Can I crouch this?

3173
02:26:01,150 --> 02:26:01,630
Or...

3174
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:02,470
You could go faster.

3175
02:26:02,590 --> 02:26:03,570
I know, but I'm scared.

3176
02:26:04,690 --> 02:26:06,350
Can I crouch this and then let it go?

3177
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:08,070
Or...

3178
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:09,070
Just crouch?

3179
02:26:09,270 --> 02:26:09,410
Okay.

3180
02:26:15,290 --> 02:26:15,770
Okay.

3181
02:26:22,530 --> 02:26:24,930
I didn't know if it was going to be so peculiar...

3182
02:26:24,930 --> 02:26:25,850
Or so particular.

3183
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,550
You know what I mean?

3184
02:26:31,380 --> 02:26:32,360
Did we go in a circle?

3185
02:26:40,650 --> 02:26:41,990
I love revolver.

3186
02:26:43,850 --> 02:26:44,310
What's that?

3187
02:26:44,670 --> 02:26:45,170
What's that?

3188
02:26:45,630 --> 02:26:46,010
What's that?

3189
02:26:47,510 --> 02:26:50,250
Book it, book it, book it, book it, book it, book it, book it, book it.

3190
02:26:52,350 --> 02:26:52,670
OOOOOO!

3191
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:55,870
Um...

3192
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:56,590
Ha ha ha!

3193
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:00,880
Uh...

3194
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,700
Oh, it was a turret!

3195
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:04,100
Ah!

3196
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:05,040
We're here!

3197
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:13,080
Okay, I believe this is our stop for now.

3198
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:16,020
Shoot the sign this way...

3199
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:18,040
Is that how it works?

3200
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:19,320
Oh...

3201
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:36,900
Sounds so bad.

3202
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,280
Boy, I'm so scared.

3203
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:39,100
He he he.

3204
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:42,700
WAAAH!

3205
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:45,760
Oh my god, you too?

3206
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:48,740
No!

3207
02:27:51,510 --> 02:27:52,270
Oh my god.

3208
02:27:53,410 --> 02:27:53,690
Ah!

3209
02:27:54,370 --> 02:27:54,850
Reload!

3210
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:55,710
The thrill!

3211
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:00,580
Gosh.

3212
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:02,960
Okay, I don't want to waste all my bullets though.

3213
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:07,200
I don't want to waste all my bullets though.

3214
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:10,460
Ouch!

3215
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:13,150
Stinky...

3216
02:28:20,070 --> 02:28:20,760
I

3217
02:28:26,350 --> 02:28:27,990
don't have to worry about those.

3218
02:28:28,930 --> 02:28:30,210
All right.

3219
02:28:30,210 --> 02:28:30,330
What?

3220
02:28:40,230 --> 02:28:41,450
Stop hitting me.

3221
02:28:41,690 --> 02:28:42,350
Oh gosh, wait.

3222
02:28:42,650 --> 02:28:43,130
Okay, there we go.

3223
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:48,670
At least these guys left a lot of their supplies.

3224
02:28:50,830 --> 02:28:52,810
At least these guys left a lot of their supplies.

3225
02:28:52,810 --> 02:28:53,250
At...

3226
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:54,090
What the?

3227
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:55,510
What was that?

3228
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:56,370
Wait, what did it...

3229
02:28:56,370 --> 02:28:56,530
What?

3230
02:28:58,050 --> 02:28:58,810
What is this?

3231
02:28:59,490 --> 02:28:59,950
How...

3232
02:28:59,950 --> 02:29:01,290
When did I...

3233
02:29:02,610 --> 02:29:03,690
How did I get this?

3234
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:10,780
Don't click again.

3235
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:11,300
Oh!

3236
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:14,460
I acc...

3237
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:16,200
What do you mean I accidentally placed C4?

3238
02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:17,760
Wait, really?

3239
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:21,540
Um...

3240
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:22,680
Can she grab it with E?

3241
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:23,860
Let me just see it.

3242
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:29,420
I was just gonna try...

3243
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:31,660
What was that?

3244
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:36,900
Um...

3245
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:37,380
Let me...

3246
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:38,520
Let me...

3247
02:29:45,490 --> 02:29:46,710
How many of that do I...

3248
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:46,950
Oh!

3249
02:29:47,130 --> 02:29:48,150
Oh, I lost it!

3250
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:51,650
Oh, well I guess there was no point in having it, huh?

3251
02:29:52,870 --> 02:29:55,390
Cause I placed it in like such a terrible location.

3252
02:29:56,670 --> 02:29:58,310
I didn't even know that I grabbed it.

3253
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,270
What does it look like?

3254
02:30:00,250 --> 02:30:01,210
You'll get more later?

3255
02:30:01,390 --> 02:30:01,530
Okay.

3256
02:30:02,550 --> 02:30:03,750
I didn't even know I had it.

3257
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:04,090
Okay.

3258
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:04,970
Well, let's see.

3259
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:07,610
Anyway...

3260
02:30:07,610 --> 02:30:08,090
It's like...

3261
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:08,970
Looks like a bag.

3262
02:30:09,130 --> 02:30:09,350
Okay.

3263
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:11,790
I'll try and be on the lookout for it.

3264
02:30:14,050 --> 02:30:16,490
Well, there really wasn't anything in this area...

3265
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:17,690
Well, I guess we didn't go in here.

3266
02:30:23,390 --> 02:30:24,110
Oh my

3267
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:30,920
God.

3268
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:31,920
Oh, I did get him.

3269
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:32,380
Okay, good.

3270
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:39,980
Take all your stuff...

3271
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:45,920
Last danger.

3272
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:45,980
Last danger.

3273
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:51,400
The rocket!

3274
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:53,180
Wah!

3275
02:30:54,540 --> 02:30:55,680
Oh my God.

3276
02:31:00,020 --> 02:31:00,420
Ow!

3277
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:02,680
Even he died!

3278
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:06,040
Wait, there's so many head crabs.

3279
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:07,240
What?

3280
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,480
That guy lit you up.

3281
02:31:09,480 --> 02:31:10,980
Oh my God.

3282
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:13,720
Damn.

3283
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:15,680
Look at there's...

3284
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:16,800
There's so many of them.

3285
02:31:21,380 --> 02:31:21,940
Um...

3286
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:22,580
I hear them.

3287
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:24,020
I hear them creepy crawling now.

3288
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:25,480
Grenade ready?

3289
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:26,920
Maybe so.

3290
02:31:35,910 --> 02:31:36,470
Oh.

3291
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:37,310
That did nothing.

3292
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:38,730
Wait, they're like following him.

3293
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:47,110
Let's...

3294
02:31:47,110 --> 02:31:48,370
Let's have him destroy them.

3295
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:50,050
Oh.

3296
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:56,860
Oh, he...

3297
02:31:56,860 --> 02:31:57,240
Yeah, see?

3298
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:58,240
He killed all of them.

3299
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:00,580
Easy.

3300
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:01,480
I guess.

3301
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:03,900
Okay, so here's a rocket.

3302
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:06,080
Um...

3303
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:06,320
Cool.

3304
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:08,980
I love friendly fire.

3305
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:11,720
Ah!

3306
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:13,660
Ah!

3307
02:32:15,550 --> 02:32:16,230
Oh my God.

3308
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:17,130
It's a never...

3309
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:18,230
Ending supply...

3310
02:32:18,770 --> 02:32:19,770
Of head crab.

3311
02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:20,250
Okay.

3312
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:21,750
Can we shut the door, please?

3313
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:27,200
Please?

3314
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:27,880
Hello?

3315
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:29,980
Ugh!

3316
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:31,320
Okay.

3317
02:32:31,820 --> 02:32:32,840
Let's just leave.

3318
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:35,780
That kinda...

3319
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:36,380
That kinda suck.

3320
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:38,020
The door is bugging out.

3321
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:40,800
A little bit.

3322
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:42,660
Yeah, it is.

3323
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:43,240
A little bit.

3324
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:46,680
Clear!

3325
02:32:50,140 --> 02:32:51,260
Okay, so...

3326
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:51,920
To...

3327
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:53,200
Switch to...

3328
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:54,740
Another thing, we...

3329
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:56,420
Press...

3330
02:32:56,420 --> 02:32:57,240
Or we shoot it?

3331
02:33:03,910 --> 02:33:04,890
Alright, yeah.

3332
02:33:05,150 --> 02:33:05,370
Okay.

3333
02:33:05,710 --> 02:33:05,930
Alright.

3334
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:13,520
I guess I was going so slow before that I didn't destroy those.

3335
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:20,820
Okay.

3336
02:33:25,970 --> 02:33:28,830
I wanna be able to make sure I get that one.

3337
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:31,270
Hey!

3338
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:33,090
Bing bing!

3339
02:33:33,730 --> 02:33:35,250
Wait, isn't there a turret here?

3340
02:33:35,510 --> 02:33:36,150
Haha, wait.

3341
02:33:37,390 --> 02:33:37,570
Save?

3342
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:38,690
Okay.

3343
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:48,250
Wait.

3344
02:33:49,910 --> 02:33:50,770
Is that it?

3345
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:51,790
Oh,

3346
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:03,820
I see it.

3347
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:04,580
Hahaha!

3348
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:07,400
Yeah, we need to raise the hook first.

3349
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:08,040
Yeah, I know.

3350
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:12,610
Dang, I don't think that got it.

3351
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:14,530
Grenade it?

3352
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:16,630
So true.

3353
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:18,030
I have to have...

3354
02:34:18,030 --> 02:34:18,970
Perfect aim.

3355
02:34:19,470 --> 02:34:20,690
Which I have!

3356
02:34:21,310 --> 02:34:22,190
Perfect...

3357
02:34:22,190 --> 02:34:22,890
Aim!

3358
02:34:23,810 --> 02:34:24,210
Aw.

3359
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:41,380
Sometimes panicking is the solution.

3360
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,360
Hahaha.

3361
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:43,380
Oh wait.

3362
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:46,060
Um, so we have to somehow...

3363
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:48,860
Get this little claw doodad up.

3364
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:53,580
Um...

3365
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:56,680
Hmm...

3366
02:34:56,680 --> 02:34:58,060
If I like really...

3367
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:00,360
Uh...

3368
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:02,940
Another switch up further ahead?

3369
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:05,340
Like this way?

3370
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:05,980
Or...

3371
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:06,520
Oh, this...

3372
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:07,000
Oh, this way.

3373
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:07,940
Okay.

3374
02:35:08,460 --> 02:35:08,580
Oh!

3375
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:09,380
Ouch!

3376
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:14,620
I'm gonna redo this part.

3377
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:15,320
Hahaha.

3378
02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:18,420
I'm just gonna redo it.

3379
02:35:18,900 --> 02:35:21,220
Since I know where the thing is now.

3380
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:22,400
Okay.

3381
02:35:23,340 --> 02:35:24,100
Alright.

3382
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:26,260
Okay.

3383
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:26,880
Alright.

3384
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:27,580
Redo!

3385
02:35:28,220 --> 02:35:28,980
Redo!

3386
02:35:29,140 --> 02:35:29,400
Redo!

3387
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:36,860
Perfect!

3388
02:35:55,860 --> 02:35:57,180
I think I got it.

3389
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:03,090
Remember you have to panic.

3390
02:36:03,330 --> 02:36:03,630
Ah!

3391
02:36:04,110 --> 02:36:04,890
You're right!

3392
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:07,030
You're right!

3393
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:09,690
You're right.

3394
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:17,860
Oh, uh...

3395
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:22,220
It'll create a time paradox.

3396
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:25,920
Ah, I forgot to panic.

3397
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:27,740
That's the secret ingredient, baby!

3398
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:29,040
Oh, wait.

3399
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:30,020
You said there was another one.

3400
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:30,660
Let's do it.

3401
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:30,980
Okay.

3402
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:37,700
I see it.

3403
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:42,910
Where were we going before?

3404
02:36:44,110 --> 02:36:44,950
Now that I think about it.

3405
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:45,250
Wait!

3406
02:36:45,310 --> 02:36:45,790
What's over there?

3407
02:36:50,510 --> 02:36:51,670
Now we're going straight.

3408
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:52,190
Okay.

3409
02:36:55,350 --> 02:36:55,950
Okay, okay.

3410
02:36:56,050 --> 02:36:56,930
That's where it looped.

3411
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:58,450
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

3412
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:00,070
Okay.

3413
02:37:09,170 --> 02:37:10,830
Oh, spitty dog.

3414
02:37:16,110 --> 02:37:17,410
Am I even hitting him?

3415
02:37:28,770 --> 02:37:29,670
There we go.

3416
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:34,410
I guess I could have gotten him from...

3417
02:37:35,890 --> 02:37:37,270
Here, but whatever.

3418
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:40,850
Whatever.

3419
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:46,140
Okay, interesting.

3420
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:48,060
There is a ladder there.

3421
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:50,080
We'll keep that in mind.

3422
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:50,920
Sweet health.

3423
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:52,200
Worth it, baby.

3424
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:54,780
I see it.

3425
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:55,620
I see some ropes!

3426
02:38:02,130 --> 02:38:02,590
Um...

3427
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:03,990
Does that go all the way down?

3428
02:38:06,190 --> 02:38:07,770
Like if he was trying to...

3429
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:14,910
We're going to get to about here, and then I'm going to blast him.

3430
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:28,920
What?

3431
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:30,000
I don't get the super jet.

3432
02:38:39,250 --> 02:38:39,670
Um...

3433
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:40,650
I don't get it.

3434
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,490
I don't like it.

3435
02:38:43,270 --> 02:38:44,110
Let's not...

3436
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:45,130
Let's not...

3437
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:57,180
I don't get it.

3438
02:38:58,720 --> 02:38:59,220
Um...

3439
02:39:00,140 --> 02:39:01,780
Let's get these boxes though.

3440
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:02,740
I can get that.

3441
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:05,220
Oh!

3442
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:05,760
Oh!

3443
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:06,620
Oh!

3444
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:07,360
Oh!

3445
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:07,380
Oh!

3446
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:07,660
Yeah.

3447
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:08,820
Okay.

3448
02:39:12,930 --> 02:39:13,290
Oh!

3449
02:39:15,130 --> 02:39:15,490
And...

3450
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:15,830
What else?

3451
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:17,270
What other goodies you got from me?

3452
02:39:18,030 --> 02:39:18,390
Grenade.

3453
02:39:18,850 --> 02:39:19,890
Actually, I did need that.

3454
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:20,330
Oh wait.

3455
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:21,450
Can I get back up here?

3456
02:39:22,050 --> 02:39:22,410
Um...

3457
02:39:22,410 --> 02:39:22,990
Did I mess up?

3458
02:39:23,610 --> 02:39:23,970
Wait.

3459
02:39:24,330 --> 02:39:25,490
It's kind of like at an angle.

3460
02:39:25,930 --> 02:39:26,490
We're fine.

3461
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:28,030
Yeah, I got this.

3462
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:28,230
Okay.

3463
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:30,110
Crouch jump.

3464
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:30,850
Who needs it?

3465
02:39:32,190 --> 02:39:34,350
All you have to do is be good at the game.

3466
02:39:36,430 --> 02:39:37,510
Crouch jump.

3467
02:39:37,810 --> 02:39:39,270
Who needs it?

3468
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:46,200
We're going into unknown territory.

3469
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:47,300
So I'm a little nervous.

3470
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:48,880
Eh.

3471
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:49,900
Oh.

3472
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:50,820
Oh.

3473
02:39:51,620 --> 02:39:52,300
Oh.

3474
02:39:52,700 --> 02:39:53,380
Oh.

3475
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:54,380
Oh!

3476
02:39:54,380 --> 02:39:54,940
Oh.

3477
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:02,720
Oh, he sounds so nasty.

3478
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:05,640
Okay.

3479
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:06,620
Okay.

3480
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:07,180
And there's a health.

3481
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,700
I thought I killed him.

3482
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:18,580
There's some more stuff under there though.

3483
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:21,560
Oh.

3484
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:22,920
I'm full on grenades.

3485
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:24,400
But I wasted so many.

3486
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:28,300
But I wasted so many.

3487
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:34,200
Okay.

3488
02:40:36,060 --> 02:40:36,980
Ah.

3489
02:40:37,360 --> 02:40:37,740
Okay.

3490
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:40,160
What's going on up here?

3491
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:41,660
Ah.

3492
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:43,140
Oh.

3493
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,080
Oh.

3494
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:46,480
What is going on up here?

3495
02:40:48,980 --> 02:40:49,440
Oh.

3496
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:51,360
Ooh.

3497
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:52,580
Ah.

3498
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:56,260
I did not recognize this area at all.

3499
02:40:57,820 --> 02:40:58,380
Oh.

3500
02:40:58,480 --> 02:40:58,800
Okay.

3501
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:00,400
Let's go.

3502
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:04,600
I'm just like, I don't know what's happening.

3503
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,360
I'm just here for the ride.

3504
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:08,460
Oh.

3505
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:09,980
There we go.

3506
02:41:11,980 --> 02:41:13,480
Literally here for the ride.

3507
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:14,040
And that's it.

3508
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:16,960
Shoot.

3509
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:20,640
I think I missed again.

3510
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:26,880
I missed, but so did he.

3511
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:27,680
And you know what?

3512
02:41:27,980 --> 02:41:30,420
That's more embarrassing than me missing.

3513
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:31,580
I think.

3514
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:36,060
He's supposed to be good at this.

3515
02:41:38,020 --> 02:41:39,840
Me, you should have no expectations.

3516
02:41:47,080 --> 02:41:49,080
AI is supposed to be the smart one.

3517
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,160
It's taking our jobs.

3518
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:55,860
Woohoo.

3519
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:08,760
Oh.

3520
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:09,960
Oh.

3521
02:42:10,200 --> 02:42:10,600
Oh.

3522
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:11,440
This is the ambush.

3523
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:12,200
Ah.

3524
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:13,340
Ah.

3525
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:25,240
Little warning, guys.

3526
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:27,420
Would've been so nice.

3527
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:31,380
Little warning would've been so nice.

3528
02:42:35,880 --> 02:42:36,480
Ah.

3529
02:42:36,760 --> 02:42:36,960
Oh.

3530
02:42:37,080 --> 02:42:37,460
I'm dead.

3531
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:38,400
I think I...

3532
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:40,450
I think...

3533
02:42:40,450 --> 02:42:40,850
Yeah.

3534
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:41,430
I died.

3535
02:42:42,390 --> 02:42:42,590
Ah.

3536
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:49,680
Oh, someone's there.

3537
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:50,980
Can I jump here?

3538
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:52,200
I'm going up.

3539
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:53,020
I'm going up.

3540
02:42:53,020 --> 02:42:53,720
You can't stop me?

3541
02:42:59,910 --> 02:43:00,510
Okay.

3542
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,300
Where'd they go, though?

3543
02:43:09,690 --> 02:43:10,290
Okay.

3544
02:43:11,810 --> 02:43:12,350
Ah.

3545
02:43:15,650 --> 02:43:16,850
What is...

3546
02:43:18,710 --> 02:43:19,670
Yeah, a ladder.

3547
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:19,990
I know.

3548
02:43:20,410 --> 02:43:22,510
I'm just...

3549
02:43:23,150 --> 02:43:23,750
Preparing.

3550
02:43:24,250 --> 02:43:24,770
Okay.

3551
02:43:26,250 --> 02:43:27,310
Maybe this is fine.

3552
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:37,820
Oh.

3553
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:38,000
Oh.

3554
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:38,620
I'm moving this.

3555
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:40,440
I was like, what's...

3556
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:53,040
Holy.

3557
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:55,000
I took so much damage there.

3558
02:43:57,540 --> 02:43:59,320
I took so much damage.

3559
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,940
What an ass.

3560
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:07,600
Good thing.

3561
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:09,160
I got the HP, I guess.

3562
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:11,440
Is there anybody else?

3563
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:12,140
Is there anybody else?

3564
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:12,660
Yes.

3565
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:14,120
Yes, there are.

3566
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:19,940
Oh, wait.

3567
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:31,300
Downstairs?

3568
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:36,180
No.

3569
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:37,780
Wrong way.

3570
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:39,320
Uh.

3571
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:47,860
Aw, man.

3572
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:50,600
Shut up.

3573
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:51,460
It's so loud.

3574
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:53,240
Ugh.

3575
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:56,640
I don't think they can hit me.

3576
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:57,700
So I'm just going to leave them.

3577
02:44:58,040 --> 02:45:00,700
I think I'm just going to let them do their thing up there.

3578
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:02,000
Okay.

3579
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:03,100
Okay.

3580
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:03,320
All right.

3581
02:45:04,380 --> 02:45:04,960
All right.

3582
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:14,460
Medical.

3583
02:45:20,680 --> 02:45:22,500
This guy sucks.

3584
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:24,720
Okay.

3585
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:29,940
Oh.

3586
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:30,840
Yeah, that's right.

3587
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:33,840
Ugh.

3588
02:45:44,660 --> 02:45:46,280
Come on, revolver.

3589
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:47,720
Don't let me down.

3590
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:49,060
Come

3591
02:45:57,630 --> 02:45:58,470
on, I'll kill you.

3592
02:46:00,250 --> 02:46:00,970
Ugh.

3593
02:46:05,890 --> 02:46:06,810
Thank you.

3594
02:46:09,130 --> 02:46:10,610
I was shooting his feet.

3595
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:10,930
Oh.

3596
02:46:11,410 --> 02:46:13,570
I was just trying to shoot anywhere that I could.

3597
02:46:14,970 --> 02:46:15,470
Bye-bye.

3598
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:17,170
Bye-bye.

3599
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:19,250
Bye-bye.

3600
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:21,070
Bye-bye.

3601
02:46:21,790 --> 02:46:22,690
Bye-bye.

3602
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,780
Okay, things are getting shot at.

3603
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:30,860
What?

3604
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:35,180
Okay.

3605
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:40,370
Uh-oh.

3606
02:46:46,110 --> 02:46:46,930
Oh my god.

3607
02:46:47,050 --> 02:46:48,590
I didn't notice that I needed to overload.

3608
02:46:51,270 --> 02:46:52,130
Where are you?

3609
02:46:53,030 --> 02:46:53,810
There we go.

3610
02:46:55,290 --> 02:46:55,530
Okay.

3611
02:46:57,250 --> 02:46:57,770
Whew.

3612
02:46:59,330 --> 02:47:00,230
Grenade time.

3613
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:01,750
It's...

3614
02:47:01,750 --> 02:47:02,950
Hit or miss for me.

3615
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:04,770
Literally.

3616
02:47:04,970 --> 02:47:05,330
Quite literally.

3617
02:47:06,010 --> 02:47:07,210
Like, quite literally.

3618
02:47:10,690 --> 02:47:11,630
There goes my...

3619
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:12,390
There goes my cart.

3620
02:47:30,910 --> 02:47:32,190
Okay, that's where...

3621
02:47:32,810 --> 02:47:34,370
See, I was looking to the...

3622
02:47:34,370 --> 02:47:35,470
To the right...

3623
02:47:35,470 --> 02:47:35,570
Okay.

3624
02:47:35,790 --> 02:47:36,030
All right.

3625
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:38,130
I'm not gonna shoot this guy's feet this time.

3626
02:47:44,730 --> 02:47:46,370
You guys see that?

3627
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:50,170
That was pretty good, huh?

3628
02:47:50,650 --> 02:47:51,890
That was pretty good, huh?

3629
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:52,070
Yeah!

3630
02:47:54,410 --> 02:47:55,350
Yeah, baby!

3631
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:09,380
Good thing I saved!

3632
02:48:11,640 --> 02:48:12,100
Oh!

3633
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:13,040
No, please, guys!

3634
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:13,480
Please!

3635
02:48:13,880 --> 02:48:14,560
Do that again!

3636
02:48:28,820 --> 02:48:30,120
Ooh, his body.

3637
02:48:44,940 --> 02:48:46,480
Maybe I could get them first.

3638
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:47,920
You know?

3639
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:57,880
I think I might have gotten someone.

3640
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:00,880
I think, actually, that worked.

3641
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:07,140
I think I got someone.

3642
02:49:07,420 --> 02:49:07,880
For real.

3643
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,500
I know there's a guy over here, though.

3644
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:12,120
Wait, hold on.

3645
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:12,720
Save, save.

3646
02:49:12,860 --> 02:49:13,140
There we go.

3647
02:49:23,100 --> 02:49:23,660
Uh...

3648
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:25,660
Mister?

3649
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:27,920
Mister?

3650
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:31,740
What if I...

3651
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:32,200
Okay, hold on.

3652
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:35,400
Just one more to be safe?

3653
02:49:35,540 --> 02:49:35,720
Yeah.

3654
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:44,840
And I'm gonna throw off this wall?

3655
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:47,220
Oh.

3656
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:50,180
That didn't quite work as intended.

3657
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:50,860
That's okay.

3658
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:53,720
Oh, she...

3659
02:49:55,240 --> 02:49:56,040
Okay, cool.

3660
02:49:57,880 --> 02:49:59,320
Um, what about that gun?

3661
02:49:59,440 --> 02:50:00,220
Can I use that?

3662
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:01,140
Or...

3663
02:50:08,930 --> 02:50:10,170
I hear another guy.

3664
02:50:10,390 --> 02:50:11,070
So, we're gonna...

3665
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:16,960
No, I don't think...

3666
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:18,820
I don't think so.

3667
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:20,100
Alright, this is fine.

3668
02:50:20,200 --> 02:50:20,560
This is fine.

3669
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:23,100
Um...

3670
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:29,000
This is fine.

3671
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:31,200
Nice.

3672
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:32,920
Okay, cool.

3673
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:35,720
Oh.

3674
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:36,920
I need...

3675
02:50:37,900 --> 02:50:38,820
Don't worry.

3676
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:47,820
Oh.

3677
02:50:49,780 --> 02:50:51,100
It's so dramatic.

3678
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:53,100
You're doing great, Vito.

3679
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:53,880
This game is tough.

3680
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:54,460
Thank you!

3681
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:57,100
I'm playing...

3682
02:50:57,100 --> 02:50:57,700
Something.

3683
02:50:58,020 --> 02:50:59,480
I'm somehow playing the game.

3684
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:02,880
Oof, we had this.

3685
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:03,840
I know.

3686
02:51:03,880 --> 02:51:04,880
This guy is so dramatic.

3687
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:05,940
Uh...

3688
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:07,300
I'm gonna actually switch over.

3689
02:51:08,040 --> 02:51:08,460
I'm gonna...

3690
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:09,020
Save.

3691
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:10,700
And we're gonna leave that health there.

3692
02:51:11,080 --> 02:51:12,100
Since I'm at 99.

3693
02:51:12,140 --> 02:51:13,700
There's no point in me taking it.

3694
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:30,050
Out him!

3695
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:30,670
Uh-oh.

3696
02:51:31,690 --> 02:51:31,970
Ah!

3697
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:36,590
Ugh!

3698
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:38,410
Ugh!

3699
02:51:39,810 --> 02:51:42,050
Okay, well, good thing I left that health pack.

3700
02:51:42,370 --> 02:51:43,610
And then good thing there's one here.

3701
02:51:43,890 --> 02:51:45,510
And then we're gonna destroy that!

3702
02:51:45,510 --> 02:51:45,730
What?

3703
02:51:47,090 --> 02:51:47,730
Oh.

3704
02:51:48,130 --> 02:51:49,170
Is there some gun?

3705
02:51:49,510 --> 02:51:50,110
Is there ammo?

3706
02:51:57,410 --> 02:51:58,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3707
02:52:01,070 --> 02:52:02,050
What was that?

3708
02:52:02,050 --> 02:52:04,130
Blylylyly, bleylyly.

3709
02:52:04,150 --> 02:52:04,190
Blylylyly.

3710
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:05,610
Blylylyly.

3711
02:52:05,610 --> 02:52:05,670
Whh!

3712
02:52:17,420 --> 02:52:18,080
Uh...

3713
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:22,000
Oh, my God.

3714
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:22,960
Oh, my God.

3715
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:25,140
I just eat bullets with the...

3716
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:25,900
With the shotgun!

3717
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:27,160
Oh!

3718
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:29,760
I just eat bullets!

3719
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:31,040
So bad!

3720
02:52:32,020 --> 02:52:32,280
Oh!

3721
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:33,420
Oh...

3722
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:37,320
It's so tanky!

3723
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:42,040
Right click on it, but then I'll take damage too!

3724
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:43,480
Hold on, I'm gonna retry.

3725
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:45,420
Here, let's retry.

3726
02:52:51,060 --> 02:52:51,520
Wait.

3727
02:52:53,580 --> 02:52:54,280
This one.

3728
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:56,760
Grenade them.

3729
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:04,120
Ouch!

3730
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:05,220
I got stuck on the wall.

3731
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:06,720
Come here, come here, come here.

3732
02:53:08,100 --> 02:53:08,840
Come here.

3733
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:13,670
What does right click with the shotgun do?

3734
02:53:15,650 --> 02:53:17,110
Oh, it uses both!

3735
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:19,350
I see, I see.

3736
02:53:21,270 --> 02:53:22,350
Okay, good to know.

3737
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:36,710
I learned.

3738
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:39,270
I learned.

3739
02:53:40,990 --> 02:53:42,030
I learned.

3740
02:53:42,030 --> 02:53:42,250
I learned.

3741
02:53:43,110 --> 02:53:47,050
I learned and I put what I learned to use.

3742
02:53:47,390 --> 02:53:47,970
Wow!

3743
02:53:48,470 --> 02:53:49,170
Sandwich!

3744
02:53:49,790 --> 02:53:50,770
Let's go!

3745
02:53:50,770 --> 02:53:50,970
What's wrong!

3746
02:53:54,650 --> 02:53:56,630
Um, is there anything else?

3747
02:53:56,930 --> 02:53:57,590
Other health?

3748
02:54:00,210 --> 02:54:00,730
And...

3749
02:54:00,730 --> 02:54:01,090
You know what?

3750
02:54:01,090 --> 02:54:01,610
I will save.

3751
02:54:02,090 --> 02:54:02,570
I think we're good.

3752
02:54:04,370 --> 02:54:04,890
Oh!

3753
02:54:15,470 --> 02:54:16,570
Just a box.

3754
02:54:17,010 --> 02:54:18,070
Is there anything in here?

3755
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,490
Oh!

3756
02:54:21,010 --> 02:54:21,430
Oh!

3757
02:54:22,570 --> 02:54:23,010
Oh!

3758
02:54:24,050 --> 02:54:24,910
Yes, there is.

3759
02:54:27,010 --> 02:54:27,890
Sometimes.

3760
02:54:28,730 --> 02:54:30,430
Sometimes, there's things.

3761
02:54:31,350 --> 02:54:32,290
Just jump.

3762
02:54:32,550 --> 02:54:32,970
Just jump.

3763
02:54:32,970 --> 02:54:34,610
These are mostly all just boxes, actually.

3764
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:38,550
Oh, dead man.

3765
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:41,610
I love when they fight each other.

3766
02:54:41,930 --> 02:54:42,790
I don't have to do anything.

3767
02:54:42,790 --> 02:54:44,790
I don't have to do anything.

3768
02:54:49,190 --> 02:54:49,970
Thank you!

3769
02:54:52,250 --> 02:54:52,770
Okay.

3770
02:54:53,070 --> 02:54:54,150
Yeah, let them fight.

3771
02:54:54,930 --> 02:54:55,090
Yeah.

3772
02:54:55,590 --> 02:54:57,210
They have their little brawls.

3773
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:04,520
No.

3774
02:55:04,860 --> 02:55:05,140
No.

3775
02:55:05,400 --> 02:55:05,600
No.

3776
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:07,820
Oops...

3777
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:10,940
Wait, hold on!

3778
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:12,320
I'm gonna retry that?

3779
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:15,080
And not stand so close.

3780
02:55:15,280 --> 02:55:16,280
Okay, too close.

3781
02:55:18,340 --> 02:55:19,520
There we go.

3782
02:55:20,560 --> 02:55:21,620
There we go.

3783
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:21,940
Okay.

3784
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:32,780
It's like when you make the monsters in Doom accidentally hit each other and then they start infighting there.

3785
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:34,860
So perfect.

3786
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:00,140
Yes.

3787
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:00,740
Wait, did I get it?

3788
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:02,420
Yes.

3789
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:07,640
You had martyrdom as a perk.

3790
02:56:16,660 --> 02:56:18,320
Oh, there he goes.

3791
02:56:19,260 --> 02:56:23,860
I took still so much... I still took so much health.

3792
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:29,360
Half-life!

3793
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:30,300
Half-life!

3794
02:56:30,860 --> 02:56:33,280
The Grunts are more of a menace than the aliens in this game.

3795
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:34,620
Actually, though.

3796
02:56:35,360 --> 02:56:39,520
I'm really... I'm really feeling that right now.

3797
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:42,000
Oh, there's some boxes here.

3798
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:49,260
What's this?

3799
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:54,600
Sacred.

3800
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:14,700
They're infighting.

3801
02:57:15,820 --> 02:57:16,340
Um,

3802
02:57:23,330 --> 02:57:23,870
I messed up.

3803
02:57:31,950 --> 02:57:33,770
I didn't realize I picked it up.

3804
02:57:34,730 --> 02:57:35,870
I think that's it.

3805
02:57:36,030 --> 02:57:36,050
No?

3806
02:57:39,070 --> 02:57:39,770
Press E.

3807
02:57:39,930 --> 02:57:40,950
It doesn't... It didn't work before.

3808
02:57:43,430 --> 02:57:44,450
Aw, what?

3809
02:57:47,170 --> 02:57:47,690
Scones!

3810
02:57:48,670 --> 02:57:49,450
Let's go!

3811
02:57:49,810 --> 02:57:50,330
Scones!

3812
02:57:52,730 --> 02:57:53,970
Only in multiplayer.

3813
02:57:56,270 --> 02:57:57,170
Let's go!

3814
02:57:57,750 --> 02:57:58,310
Scones!

3815
02:57:58,550 --> 02:57:59,530
Oh, there's another health.

3816
02:58:00,150 --> 02:58:00,710
Yippee me!

3817
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:01,570
Lucky, lucky.

3818
02:58:03,150 --> 02:58:03,710
Let's go!

3819
02:58:03,890 --> 02:58:04,390
We got it!

3820
02:58:05,570 --> 02:58:06,650
Oh my god!

3821
02:58:06,850 --> 02:58:07,350
Shut up!

3822
02:58:08,590 --> 02:58:09,150
Scones!

3823
02:58:10,910 --> 02:58:11,470
Scones!

3824
02:58:11,470 --> 02:58:12,330
Let's go!

3825
02:58:15,670 --> 02:58:17,630
I don't know if that was...

3826
02:58:17,630 --> 02:58:19,450
Um, a...

3827
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:21,930
really good amount of health, but...

3828
02:58:21,930 --> 02:58:22,450
you know what?

3829
02:58:22,530 --> 02:58:23,470
If it works, it works.

3830
02:58:23,950 --> 02:58:24,350
Okay.

3831
02:58:24,570 --> 02:58:24,950
All right.

3832
02:58:26,710 --> 02:58:27,210
Ah.

3833
02:58:28,510 --> 02:58:29,010
Ah.

3834
02:58:29,510 --> 02:58:32,630
I don't remember what I had before, but...

3835
02:58:39,530 --> 02:58:41,130
Shut up, please.

3836
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:52,680
Annoying creatures.

3837
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:55,540
Everybody, all of you.

3838
02:58:55,860 --> 02:58:59,900
This is not us versus aliens or anything.

3839
02:59:00,180 --> 02:59:02,000
This is me against the world.

3840
02:59:02,760 --> 02:59:03,700
Love the hermit.

3841
02:59:03,820 --> 02:59:04,440
Thank you.

3842
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:05,860
Put him out of his misery.

3843
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:07,540
The guy was bugging out.

3844
02:59:08,460 --> 02:59:10,520
He didn't, he didn't, he didn't, you know.

3845
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,500
He was, I put it, yeah, I really did just put him out of his misery.

3846
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:14,880
What was that?

3847
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:22,840
Oh, that's me.

3848
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:24,360
I was like, what's that sound?

3849
02:59:30,140 --> 02:59:32,200
I don't know where I'm at, where I'm going.

3850
02:59:32,900 --> 02:59:32,960
Oh.

3851
02:59:38,530 --> 02:59:39,010
Um.

3852
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:41,030
I was here before.

3853
02:59:42,170 --> 02:59:43,170
Yeah, yeah, wait.

3854
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:44,530
Oh, this is a big old circle.

3855
02:59:44,750 --> 02:59:46,830
Because this is where that one health pack is.

3856
02:59:47,150 --> 02:59:49,430
Oh, and my... Oh.

3857
02:59:50,470 --> 02:59:50,950
Yes.

3858
02:59:51,290 --> 02:59:52,970
Oh, and my boat.

3859
02:59:53,390 --> 02:59:53,870
Hey.

3860
02:59:55,630 --> 02:59:56,110
Yeah.

3861
02:59:56,490 --> 02:59:56,950
Reload.

3862
02:59:57,090 --> 02:59:57,550
Thank you.

3863
02:59:57,830 --> 02:59:58,150
I will.

3864
03:00:00,350 --> 03:00:00,830
Yeah.

3865
03:00:02,430 --> 03:00:03,430
Does this work?

3866
03:00:09,270 --> 03:00:11,010
Okay, I'm not very good at using it.

3867
03:00:11,350 --> 03:00:12,030
Get me off of this.

3868
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:14,190
Get me off of this ride.

3869
03:00:15,410 --> 03:00:16,150
All right.

3870
03:00:18,930 --> 03:00:20,110
Let's keep going.

3871
03:00:33,210 --> 03:00:34,150
Let's scones.

3872
03:00:34,690 --> 03:00:35,470
World of the story.

3873
03:00:35,830 --> 03:00:38,450
Minto hates scones and everyone that likes them.

3874
03:00:38,450 --> 03:00:39,010
What?

3875
03:00:39,210 --> 03:00:40,130
No, I...

3876
03:00:40,130 --> 03:00:41,290
Oh, no.

3877
03:00:41,550 --> 03:00:43,210
I did like a...

3878
03:00:43,770 --> 03:00:44,410
What's that sound?

3879
03:00:46,830 --> 03:00:47,530
We're fine.

3880
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:49,450
I did a, um...

3881
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:51,490
Uh, like a high tea...

3882
03:00:52,750 --> 03:00:53,230
Thing.

3883
03:00:53,470 --> 03:00:55,290
Not too long ago with some friends.

3884
03:00:56,790 --> 03:00:57,270
Oh.

3885
03:00:57,450 --> 03:00:57,590
Oh.

3886
03:00:57,770 --> 03:00:57,970
Oh.

3887
03:00:58,050 --> 03:00:58,230
Wait.

3888
03:00:58,350 --> 03:00:58,490
Please.

3889
03:00:58,970 --> 03:00:59,290
Rivers.

3890
03:00:59,470 --> 03:00:59,650
Rivers.

3891
03:00:59,950 --> 03:01:00,310
Rivers.

3892
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:00,690
Rivers.

3893
03:01:01,530 --> 03:01:02,890
And they had scones.

3894
03:01:04,390 --> 03:01:06,530
And I actually quite like them.

3895
03:01:07,250 --> 03:01:07,850
Those scones.

3896
03:01:10,870 --> 03:01:11,330
Oh.

3897
03:01:12,690 --> 03:01:13,150
Wait.

3898
03:01:13,270 --> 03:01:14,990
I think I was pretty close to a hundred already.

3899
03:01:16,030 --> 03:01:16,590
High tea.

3900
03:01:16,930 --> 03:01:17,130
Yeah.

3901
03:01:17,350 --> 03:01:21,830
You know, like when you go and get the fancy tea and they give you macarons and tiny sandwiches.

3902
03:01:26,200 --> 03:01:27,140
That's what I did.

3903
03:01:32,780 --> 03:01:34,760
A fancy tea party.

3904
03:01:36,020 --> 03:01:36,740
Okay.

3905
03:01:41,050 --> 03:01:41,690
Pinkies up?

3906
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:42,310
Absolutely.

3907
03:01:43,670 --> 03:01:44,650
And I got a scone.

3908
03:01:45,490 --> 03:01:47,230
And we were actually like kind of...

3909
03:02:03,280 --> 03:02:05,400
Will we see a rerun of the minto plushies?

3910
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:06,280
Maybe in the future.

3911
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:14,700
Can I throw so far?

3912
03:02:18,760 --> 03:02:19,840
I messed up.

3913
03:02:30,890 --> 03:02:33,430
Mister, you are going down.

3914
03:02:34,310 --> 03:02:35,890
That's not my last name.

3915
03:02:39,030 --> 03:02:40,190
That's my maiden name.

3916
03:02:46,790 --> 03:02:47,190
Okay.

3917
03:02:49,390 --> 03:02:49,790
Scones!

3918
03:02:52,410 --> 03:02:56,730
Oh my gosh, the fact that it has to keep reloading every time is so annoying.

3919
03:02:57,790 --> 03:02:59,910
I can take these guys out nice and easy.

3920
03:03:01,110 --> 03:03:02,610
Ah, so peaceful.

3921
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:04,230
Scones!

3922
03:03:04,330 --> 03:03:05,790
I lost a little bit of health.

3923
03:03:05,970 --> 03:03:08,230
Oh my god, the loading is kind of giving me a headache though.

3924
03:03:08,610 --> 03:03:09,950
So let's move forward.

3925
03:03:11,730 --> 03:03:12,390
Wait, oh.

3926
03:03:12,610 --> 03:03:13,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait, please.

3927
03:03:14,210 --> 03:03:15,010
Okay, all right.

3928
03:03:15,550 --> 03:03:15,750
Save.

3929
03:03:16,070 --> 03:03:16,510
All right.

3930
03:03:16,870 --> 03:03:17,550
I have him flow.

3931
03:03:30,280 --> 03:03:30,720
Ouch.

3932
03:03:31,080 --> 03:03:31,500
Oh no!

3933
03:03:41,280 --> 03:03:42,880
I accidentally touched it.

3934
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:46,480
It's okay, if I restart, I restart.

3935
03:04:10,300 --> 03:04:11,820
Wait, who's fist fighting?

3936
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:16,160
Who is fist fighting over here?

3937
03:04:26,560 --> 03:04:28,180
I think I'm in trouble again.

3938
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:29,060
Oh man.

3939
03:04:30,160 --> 03:04:30,500
Wait!

3940
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:31,640
I see him!

3941
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:33,400
Don't touch my man.

3942
03:04:34,140 --> 03:04:35,080
He's mine.

3943
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:36,040
I want him.

3944
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:39,520
I will protect him.

3945
03:04:51,610 --> 03:04:52,190
I tried.

3946
03:04:54,590 --> 03:04:55,150
You know what?

3947
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:56,610
This is fine because I'll get my health back.

3948
03:04:56,970 --> 03:04:57,710
This is fine.

3949
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:58,330
This is fine.

3950
03:05:01,210 --> 03:05:02,130
This is fine.

3951
03:05:02,270 --> 03:05:02,810
This is fine.

3952
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:05,650
I'll get my health back.

3953
03:05:06,470 --> 03:05:06,830
Oh shoot.

3954
03:05:10,670 --> 03:05:11,770
Yeah, I do want.

3955
03:05:12,850 --> 03:05:14,690
I do want to take this stuff.

3956
03:05:14,850 --> 03:05:15,150
There we go.

3957
03:05:15,150 --> 03:05:15,430
Okay.

3958
03:05:15,910 --> 03:05:16,670
All right.

3959
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:20,070
Oh!

3960
03:05:20,590 --> 03:05:21,150
Oh!

3961
03:05:21,410 --> 03:05:21,890
I didn't...

3962
03:05:21,890 --> 03:05:22,670
I didn't get...

3963
03:05:22,670 --> 03:05:23,310
I did...

3964
03:05:23,310 --> 03:05:23,410
Oh!

3965
03:05:23,730 --> 03:05:24,050
Nice.

3966
03:05:24,370 --> 03:05:24,470
Okay.

3967
03:05:26,110 --> 03:05:27,430
Headcrab needs a promotion.

3968
03:05:27,830 --> 03:05:29,650
Let's let them do their thingies.

3969
03:05:30,510 --> 03:05:31,890
Yeah, give them a little...

3970
03:05:31,890 --> 03:05:32,770
Give them their moment.

3971
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:33,810
Give them their space.

3972
03:05:34,450 --> 03:05:37,310
You guys, we're respectable, you know?

3973
03:05:44,570 --> 03:05:46,150
Oh, the yellow part is safe.

3974
03:05:48,130 --> 03:05:49,030
Excuse you.

3975
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:01,820
Well, I didn't lose all my health this time, so...

3976
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:03,900
We're already...

3977
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:05,780
We're already doing way better than before.

3978
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:09,740
Wait, where is he?

3979
03:06:12,830 --> 03:06:13,310
Funny.

3980
03:06:15,710 --> 03:06:16,510
Okay, cool.

3981
03:06:17,990 --> 03:06:19,390
Yeah, we're gonna get Barney out.

3982
03:06:20,230 --> 03:06:20,750
Barney!

3983
03:06:24,330 --> 03:06:24,850
Barney.

3984
03:06:28,090 --> 03:06:29,370
Don't die on me, Barney!

3985
03:06:29,590 --> 03:06:30,790
Don't die on me, Barney!

3986
03:06:33,230 --> 03:06:34,690
He held his own!

3987
03:06:35,130 --> 03:06:36,310
Oh, Barney!

3988
03:06:36,390 --> 03:06:37,390
You saved me!

3989
03:06:43,090 --> 03:06:45,090
Look at him pulling up his pants.

3990
03:06:45,310 --> 03:06:46,530
Get a belt, Barney!

3991
03:06:47,190 --> 03:06:47,690
God.

3992
03:06:50,890 --> 03:06:51,430
Oh.

3993
03:06:51,910 --> 03:06:53,110
Wait, did I grab those?

3994
03:06:53,330 --> 03:06:53,730
Yes?

3995
03:06:57,890 --> 03:06:58,430
You...

3996
03:06:59,130 --> 03:07:01,010
Something died down here.

3997
03:07:01,150 --> 03:07:02,490
You stay in here, okay, buddy?

3998
03:07:02,930 --> 03:07:03,950
You stay in here.

3999
03:07:05,350 --> 03:07:07,930
All right, before we do that...

4000
03:07:07,930 --> 03:07:09,230
Hold on, I'm gonna get my pistol out.

4001
03:07:15,560 --> 03:07:16,440
Oh my god.

4002
03:07:16,440 --> 03:07:16,480
Oh my god.

4003
03:07:26,050 --> 03:07:29,150
I think head crabs may be the worst.

4004
03:07:30,410 --> 03:07:32,090
I think they might be.

4005
03:07:32,430 --> 03:07:34,210
My least favorite thing ever.

4006
03:07:35,590 --> 03:07:36,930
Wait, can I climb up here?

4007
03:07:36,930 --> 03:07:37,010
Can I climb up here?

4008
03:07:38,650 --> 03:07:40,020
Wait, uh...

4009
03:07:40,510 --> 03:07:40,850
Wait.

4010
03:07:46,140 --> 03:07:47,080
Am I dying?

4011
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:49,780
Stupid.

4012
03:07:53,860 --> 03:07:54,490
Come here.

4013
03:07:56,440 --> 03:07:57,970
It actually did its job!

4014
03:08:03,400 --> 03:08:05,980
Aw, you made me break it!

4015
03:08:12,780 --> 03:08:13,480
What are we getting?

4016
03:08:15,740 --> 03:08:16,840
Oh, it's empty.

4017
03:08:17,980 --> 03:08:19,000
Purple drink.

4018
03:08:20,040 --> 03:08:20,680
Empty.

4019
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:24,920
There was a battery up there.

4020
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:25,380
No!

4021
03:08:26,360 --> 03:08:27,460
Should I just reload?

4022
03:08:31,610 --> 03:08:33,010
I at least have health here.

4023
03:08:36,890 --> 03:08:37,450
Ooh!

4024
03:08:41,640 --> 03:08:43,480
It gets you plus one HP?

4025
03:08:43,980 --> 03:08:44,540
Wait.

4026
03:08:45,140 --> 03:08:46,520
What do you mean plus one HP?

4027
03:08:46,580 --> 03:08:47,320
Like 101?

4028
03:08:51,300 --> 03:08:54,080
Or like 15 to 16 armor.

4029
03:08:57,440 --> 03:08:59,080
One soda equals one HP.

4030
03:08:59,540 --> 03:08:59,920
Oh, really?

4031
03:09:00,720 --> 03:09:02,900
I've been breaking the machines every time.

4032
03:09:05,440 --> 03:09:06,700
Oh, if purchased.

4033
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:11,300
I'm hearing something.

4034
03:09:11,560 --> 03:09:12,340
I don't quite know.

4035
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:15,820
Yeah, me too.

4036
03:09:16,140 --> 03:09:16,980
I'm just gonna save.

4037
03:09:16,980 --> 03:09:17,520
Let's just go.

4038
03:09:17,640 --> 03:09:18,040
And we're fine.

4039
03:09:25,370 --> 03:09:25,730
Golly!

4040
03:09:26,090 --> 03:09:26,330
Mister!

4041
03:09:29,530 --> 03:09:29,890
Oh!

4042
03:09:30,090 --> 03:09:30,910
What the hell is that?

4043
03:09:31,830 --> 03:09:32,610
That's not a Mister!

4044
03:09:33,970 --> 03:09:34,610
What is...

4045
03:09:34,610 --> 03:09:35,470
Is that a turret?

4046
03:09:43,800 --> 03:09:44,400
It's a...

4047
03:09:44,400 --> 03:09:44,840
Oh.

4048
03:09:45,060 --> 03:09:45,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4049
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:46,120
Can I...

4050
03:09:46,120 --> 03:09:46,840
Can I grenade it?

4051
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,460
I like how I still have the C4.

4052
03:09:48,740 --> 03:09:50,600
I can just explode it whenever I feel like.

4053
03:09:51,960 --> 03:09:53,360
It's a guy on a turret.

4054
03:10:15,330 --> 03:10:17,070
I don't think that works.

4055
03:10:34,220 --> 03:10:35,580
I don't think that works.

4056
03:10:42,780 --> 03:10:44,720
Surely there's some health in here.

4057
03:10:45,650 --> 03:10:46,120
Surrender?

4058
03:10:46,580 --> 03:10:46,700
Surrender?

4059
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:46,940
Okay.

4060
03:10:47,140 --> 03:10:47,320
Whew.

4061
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:48,700
I don't...

4062
03:10:48,700 --> 03:10:49,260
I...

4063
03:10:49,260 --> 03:10:50,620
I didn't know.

4064
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:52,240
I...

4065
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:54,920
What actually does that say?

4066
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:05,520
E-men.

4067
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:07,580
Freeman?

4068
03:11:07,580 --> 03:11:08,200
Freeman?!

4069
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:09,060
That's me!

4070
03:11:09,480 --> 03:11:10,460
Wait a second.

4071
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:11,430
Um...

4072
03:11:11,860 --> 03:11:14,180
What do you mean, surrender Freeman?

4073
03:11:14,180 --> 03:11:15,840
Hmm?

4074
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:22,280
Is that on the other side?

4075
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:24,940
They know my name!

4076
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:28,460
Nice.

4077
03:11:31,820 --> 03:11:32,520
Okay.

4078
03:11:34,480 --> 03:11:35,920
Free man.

4079
03:11:37,140 --> 03:11:38,340
Come with me if you...

4080
03:11:38,340 --> 03:11:38,480
Okay.

4081
03:11:38,660 --> 03:11:39,100
Never mind.

4082
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:39,740
You okay?

4083
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:43,560
We'll just leave him here.

4084
03:11:45,120 --> 03:11:46,560
He'll find his way out.

4085
03:11:46,900 --> 03:11:50,140
I'd like to get my hands on the guy responsible for this mess.

4086
03:11:50,360 --> 03:11:51,060
Yeah, me too.

4087
03:11:51,240 --> 03:11:53,220
I'm gonna manually save.

4088
03:11:54,140 --> 03:11:58,560
Because if I wanna maybe redo that part, I'd be good too.

4089
03:11:58,760 --> 03:11:59,060
I don't know.

4090
03:11:59,180 --> 03:11:59,480
We'll see.

4091
03:12:00,140 --> 03:12:00,480
Okay.

4092
03:12:00,660 --> 03:12:02,040
So now, um...

4093
03:12:04,020 --> 03:12:04,700
What?

4094
03:12:04,940 --> 03:12:05,700
Because our...

4095
03:12:05,700 --> 03:12:07,340
Our boat doesn't go any further.

4096
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:17,840
Unless...

4097
03:12:18,520 --> 03:12:18,860
Oh!

4098
03:12:23,800 --> 03:12:25,160
No movement check.

4099
03:12:25,340 --> 03:12:25,540
Please.

4100
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:30,640
Maybe I can bait him over to here?

4101
03:12:30,980 --> 03:12:32,340
And then explode him.

4102
03:12:33,100 --> 03:12:33,760
Maybe.

4103
03:12:57,780 --> 03:12:59,180
Spspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspspsps

4104
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:13,600
Guys, I died... to the electricity.

4105
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:17,860
I think I should redo this part.

4106
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:20,220
I'm not gonna lie.

4107
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:22,700
I feel like I should redo this part.

4108
03:13:23,260 --> 03:13:24,520
What do you guys think?

4109
03:13:26,520 --> 03:13:27,880
I'm gonna try it.

4110
03:13:28,400 --> 03:13:28,980
Hold on.

4111
03:13:29,320 --> 03:13:30,580
It was the autosave, right?

4112
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:31,680
This one?

4113
03:13:32,680 --> 03:13:33,360
Or...

4114
03:13:34,480 --> 03:13:34,940
Quick?

4115
03:13:35,180 --> 03:13:36,240
Yeah, the quicksave.

4116
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:42,260
There's this one.

4117
03:13:43,920 --> 03:13:45,400
Um, we did all this.

4118
03:13:45,860 --> 03:13:46,460
Okay, okay, okay.

4119
03:13:47,500 --> 03:13:48,420
And then...

4120
03:13:49,180 --> 03:13:50,980
I just gotta get this guy first try.

4121
03:13:54,320 --> 03:13:56,760
I'll be happy to survive this with all my parts.

4122
03:13:59,300 --> 03:13:59,760
Okay.

4123
03:14:06,740 --> 03:14:07,740
Oh, now I hear him.

4124
03:14:08,040 --> 03:14:09,140
Now I hear him.

4125
03:14:09,640 --> 03:14:13,180
Now I hear him.

4126
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:14,200
Okay.

4127
03:14:17,840 --> 03:14:18,360
Okay.

4128
03:14:18,780 --> 03:14:19,600
I'm gonna save.

4129
03:14:20,020 --> 03:14:20,900
Alright, we're saving.

4130
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:22,680
Okay, and then we're gonna...

4131
03:14:29,220 --> 03:14:30,180
Boom, baby!

4132
03:14:30,180 --> 03:14:30,500
Wee!

4133
03:14:31,260 --> 03:14:34,040
I took 20 damage, but that's better than the...

4134
03:14:34,040 --> 03:14:35,260
Than what we have before!

4135
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:37,120
Woo-hoo!

4136
03:14:40,320 --> 03:14:40,840
Okay.

4137
03:14:45,980 --> 03:14:47,120
Surrender, E-Man!

4138
03:14:50,140 --> 03:14:50,660
Okay.

4139
03:14:51,240 --> 03:14:52,240
And, uh...

4140
03:14:52,240 --> 03:14:54,260
I think it was just three, but that's fine too.

4141
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:54,760
Okay.

4142
03:14:54,760 --> 03:14:54,820
Okay.

4143
03:14:56,100 --> 03:14:58,060
And we'll go to the other side.

4144
03:14:58,380 --> 03:15:00,020
And we'll shoot...

4145
03:15:00,020 --> 03:15:00,720
These.

4146
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:03,180
Very good.

4147
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:04,300
For the future.

4148
03:15:07,160 --> 03:15:07,720
And,

4149
03:15:15,810 --> 03:15:16,090
uh...

4150
03:15:16,370 --> 03:15:17,750
Okay, so they're below me.

4151
03:15:18,630 --> 03:15:21,310
So maybe I can run into the other area.

4152
03:15:21,650 --> 03:15:22,110
Let's see.

4153
03:15:22,330 --> 03:15:22,530
Okay.

4154
03:15:25,350 --> 03:15:25,890
Okay.

4155
03:15:25,890 --> 03:15:26,970
There is no other area.

4156
03:15:27,310 --> 03:15:28,710
There is no other area.

4157
03:15:29,410 --> 03:15:29,950
Oh!

4158
03:15:30,190 --> 03:15:30,450
Ow!

4159
03:15:30,810 --> 03:15:31,350
No!

4160
03:15:31,970 --> 03:15:32,930
Okay, hold on.

4161
03:15:33,530 --> 03:15:34,070
Okay.

4162
03:15:34,270 --> 03:15:35,330
There is no other area.

4163
03:15:35,530 --> 03:15:36,010
I have...

4164
03:15:36,010 --> 03:15:36,970
I've since learned.

4165
03:15:37,270 --> 03:15:37,730
I've...

4166
03:15:37,730 --> 03:15:38,470
I've done a...

4167
03:15:38,470 --> 03:15:39,890
A scientific study.

4168
03:15:41,230 --> 03:15:42,810
It's just murder floor.

4169
03:15:43,730 --> 03:15:45,090
How do I do this?

4170
03:15:46,530 --> 03:15:47,170
Um...

4171
03:15:55,980 --> 03:15:56,700
Where is he?

4172
03:15:58,680 --> 03:15:59,340
Hey, mister!

4173
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:05,680
Throw a grenade.

4174
03:16:08,100 --> 03:16:09,680
I can try and throw a grenade.

4175
03:16:21,380 --> 03:16:22,020
Check in.

4176
03:16:28,070 --> 03:16:28,710
Where?

4177
03:16:28,990 --> 03:16:30,510
Who is shooting at me?

4178
03:16:30,510 --> 03:16:31,390
Oh, there...

4179
03:16:31,390 --> 03:16:32,570
Oh my god!

4180
03:16:32,750 --> 03:16:33,950
The eyes of a hawk!

4181
03:16:37,610 --> 03:16:38,270
Ugh!

4182
03:16:42,020 --> 03:16:42,660
Okay.

4183
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:44,980
We got him.

4184
03:16:47,100 --> 03:16:47,760
Nice.

4185
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:53,100
That doesn't sound good.

4186
03:16:54,720 --> 03:16:56,120
Don't know how to feel about that.

4187
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:00,400
Oh!

4188
03:17:01,240 --> 03:17:03,100
Where did this one come from?

4189
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:03,800
Wait, what's over here?

4190
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:05,620
Math...

4191
03:17:06,960 --> 03:17:07,560
And...

4192
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:09,720
Bullets...

4193
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:11,360
And health...

4194
03:17:11,360 --> 03:17:12,500
Wait, really?

4195
03:17:12,580 --> 03:17:13,540
I don't need any more bullets?

4196
03:17:13,660 --> 03:17:14,080
It's crazy.

4197
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:17,000
Unboxing time.

4198
03:17:17,460 --> 03:17:18,580
Merry Christmas!

4199
03:17:20,260 --> 03:17:22,000
You guys got coal.

4200
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:25,260
Sad, sad, sad.

4201
03:17:25,700 --> 03:17:26,840
Should've been...

4202
03:17:26,840 --> 03:17:27,360
Better good...

4203
03:17:27,360 --> 03:17:28,580
Better boys and girls.

4204
03:17:28,580 --> 03:17:29,420
Oh my god.

4205
03:17:30,400 --> 03:17:30,960
Spitty...

4206
03:17:31,400 --> 03:17:31,680
Spitter.

4207
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:39,980
Let's go.

4208
03:17:40,600 --> 03:17:41,400
Let's go!

4209
03:17:45,440 --> 03:17:47,440
I think I can just...

4210
03:17:48,380 --> 03:17:50,140
I guess I can just duck with these.

4211
03:17:57,220 --> 03:17:58,760
Looks like I got it.

4212
03:18:04,700 --> 03:18:05,160
Let's go!

4213
03:18:05,420 --> 03:18:05,560
Let's go!

4214
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:06,940
Let's go!

4215
03:18:10,580 --> 03:18:11,040
Let's go!

4216
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:11,400
I'm scared.

4217
03:18:11,560 --> 03:18:12,560
I'm gonna get ambushed though.

4218
03:18:12,820 --> 03:18:13,160
Hahaha!

4219
03:18:16,580 --> 03:18:18,540
I think I am about to get ambushed.

4220
03:18:29,820 --> 03:18:31,240
It's a turret.

4221
03:18:34,220 --> 03:18:35,660
It's a turret.

4222
03:18:36,820 --> 03:18:37,840
It's a turret.

4223
03:18:45,170 --> 03:18:46,010
It's a turret.

4224
03:18:46,110 --> 03:18:47,370
Nimmie nightmare!

4225
03:18:49,550 --> 03:18:51,370
Thank you for the ring!

4226
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:55,760
Oh!

4227
03:18:55,920 --> 03:18:56,820
I'm activating these.

4228
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:57,580
I'm so silly.

4229
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:00,880
Come back!

4230
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:02,560
I hope you had fun with...

4231
03:19:02,980 --> 03:19:03,720
Elden Ring.

4232
03:19:04,940 --> 03:19:05,700
I'm playing...

4233
03:19:06,140 --> 03:19:07,760
Old, old boomer shooter.

4234
03:19:12,610 --> 03:19:12,990
Um...

4235
03:19:13,650 --> 03:19:14,430
What you hear?

4236
03:19:14,590 --> 03:19:15,270
Is a turret.

4237
03:19:16,750 --> 03:19:17,830
That I will destroy.

4238
03:19:18,150 --> 03:19:19,090
Thank you for the gift of you guys!

4239
03:19:19,210 --> 03:19:19,730
Thanks, dog strings!

4240
03:19:20,410 --> 03:19:21,610
Wait, who was the other one?

4241
03:19:21,690 --> 03:19:22,250
Sorry, I missed it.

4242
03:19:22,250 --> 03:19:22,950
Oh, ducky!

4243
03:19:23,090 --> 03:19:23,410
Thank you!

4244
03:19:24,270 --> 03:19:24,690
Okay.

4245
03:19:24,930 --> 03:19:25,970
I'm gonna do my best.

4246
03:19:30,070 --> 03:19:30,490
Uh...

4247
03:19:30,490 --> 03:19:31,450
Oh, there's two of them.

4248
03:19:31,610 --> 03:19:32,130
There's two of them.

4249
03:19:32,310 --> 03:19:32,910
There's two of them.

4250
03:19:33,990 --> 03:19:35,110
Wow, it took like...

4251
03:19:35,110 --> 03:19:36,770
Wow, they missed like almost every shot!

4252
03:19:37,690 --> 03:19:38,070
Yeah!

4253
03:19:39,190 --> 03:19:39,650
Okay, sir.

4254
03:19:39,730 --> 03:19:40,710
Thank you, Nano.

4255
03:19:40,930 --> 03:19:41,410
Thank you!

4256
03:19:43,790 --> 03:19:44,610
That was...

4257
03:19:44,610 --> 03:19:45,710
That was kinda funny.

4258
03:19:51,610 --> 03:19:52,030
Okay.

4259
03:19:53,390 --> 03:19:53,830
Alright.

4260
03:19:53,830 --> 03:19:57,250
Yeah, I'm playing Half-Life for the first time ever.

4261
03:19:59,090 --> 03:19:59,530
Wait.

4262
03:19:59,770 --> 03:20:00,490
Was that another one?

4263
03:20:00,870 --> 03:20:01,790
I heard a beep.

4264
03:20:02,350 --> 03:20:03,890
Look, we got goop on the...

4265
03:20:03,890 --> 03:20:04,810
front of our...

4266
03:20:04,810 --> 03:20:05,490
ship.

4267
03:20:09,720 --> 03:20:10,160
Oh!

4268
03:20:10,300 --> 03:20:11,120
There is another one.

4269
03:20:11,240 --> 03:20:12,160
All the way down there.

4270
03:20:12,300 --> 03:20:12,560
Okay.

4271
03:20:13,420 --> 03:20:13,920
Okay, okay.

4272
03:20:14,480 --> 03:20:15,360
DC, thank you!

4273
03:20:17,760 --> 03:20:18,200
Um...

4274
03:20:18,700 --> 03:20:19,900
I'm gonna just blow this up.

4275
03:20:25,200 --> 03:20:25,600
Okay.

4276
03:20:26,280 --> 03:20:26,680
Okay.

4277
03:20:33,440 --> 03:20:34,940
Guys, I set out to do something.

4278
03:20:35,280 --> 03:20:35,700
And I...

4279
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:36,060
I...

4280
03:20:36,060 --> 03:20:36,980
I completed it.

4281
03:20:37,260 --> 03:20:37,960
I did it.

4282
03:20:38,200 --> 03:20:39,500
I said I'm gonna blow this up.

4283
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:39,980
And I...

4284
03:20:39,980 --> 03:20:40,200
You know what?

4285
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:41,520
That's exactly what I did.

4286
03:20:41,520 --> 03:20:42,520
Sorry.

4287
03:20:43,680 --> 03:20:44,880
I just recently...

4288
03:20:45,400 --> 03:20:46,840
Caught the C4.

4289
03:20:48,340 --> 03:20:50,240
I'm sniping with my shotgun.

4290
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:57,480
Gotta make the game challenging.

4291
03:20:57,860 --> 03:20:58,820
Absolutely.

4292
03:21:03,160 --> 03:21:05,300
This game is way too easy.

4293
03:21:10,540 --> 03:21:13,480
Otherwise, this game is just way too easy.

4294
03:21:18,660 --> 03:21:20,220
Why did I do that?

4295
03:21:22,520 --> 03:21:23,960
When did I last save?

4296
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:25,720
I've got a...

4297
03:21:26,920 --> 03:21:27,500
Oh.

4298
03:21:27,940 --> 03:21:28,040
Okay.

4299
03:21:28,660 --> 03:21:28,880
Alright.

4300
03:21:29,180 --> 03:21:30,360
I have to redo this.

4301
03:21:30,360 --> 03:21:31,140
Alright, it's fine.

4302
03:21:31,260 --> 03:21:31,740
We got this.

4303
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:32,780
We're gamers.

4304
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:37,500
I got electrocuted a little bit.

4305
03:21:51,220 --> 03:21:53,340
That didn't go as well.

4306
03:21:54,760 --> 03:21:55,480
But...

4307
03:22:00,090 --> 03:22:01,490
We still have more health...

4308
03:22:01,870 --> 03:22:03,050
Than before.

4309
03:22:09,380 --> 03:22:10,940
We still have...

4310
03:22:10,940 --> 03:22:12,360
More health...

4311
03:22:12,360 --> 03:22:13,560
Than we did...

4312
03:22:13,560 --> 03:22:14,540
Last time.

4313
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:19,460
Go in the fridge?

4314
03:22:21,940 --> 03:22:22,420
Go in the fridge?

4315
03:22:22,420 --> 03:22:22,760
Fridge?

4316
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:27,340
One full burst should take them out?

4317
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:27,660
Okay.

4318
03:22:28,740 --> 03:22:29,220
Yeah.

4319
03:22:31,260 --> 03:22:32,600
I'm trying... I'm like...

4320
03:22:32,600 --> 03:22:33,420
I'm like...

4321
03:22:33,420 --> 03:22:35,160
What's the point of using bullets sparingly?

4322
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:36,180
If I have to do it...

4323
03:22:36,180 --> 03:22:37,440
Multiple times, you know?

4324
03:22:42,820 --> 03:22:44,380
Is this Half-Life 1 or 2?

4325
03:22:44,640 --> 03:22:45,900
It's Half-Life...

4326
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:46,680
One.

4327
03:22:47,800 --> 03:22:48,360
You...

4328
03:22:49,780 --> 03:22:50,460
You're...

4329
03:22:51,220 --> 03:22:51,900
You're...

4330
03:22:51,900 --> 03:22:52,460
You're dead, Freeman.

4331
03:22:54,360 --> 03:22:54,700
You're...

4332
03:22:58,550 --> 03:22:59,230
You're...

4333
03:22:59,230 --> 03:22:59,950
You're dead.

4334
03:23:00,530 --> 03:23:01,050
Oh!

4335
03:23:08,120 --> 03:23:09,880
I didn't see the rope.

4336
03:23:11,260 --> 03:23:12,360
I fell...

4337
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:12,960
I fell...

4338
03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:14,020
I fell straight into his little trap.

4339
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:15,180
His little...

4340
03:23:15,720 --> 03:23:17,000
His little tentacle trap.

4341
03:23:17,620 --> 03:23:19,000
You're dead, Minto.

4342
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:22,240
I am!

4343
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:26,040
I'm reloading.

4344
03:23:26,160 --> 03:23:27,060
I'm so sorry, guys.

4345
03:23:27,480 --> 03:23:28,620
I'll save after.

4346
03:23:28,840 --> 03:23:29,400
I promise.

4347
03:23:32,340 --> 03:23:33,040
You know what?

4348
03:23:33,100 --> 03:23:33,300
I'm...

4349
03:23:33,300 --> 03:23:34,200
I am gonna throw a grenade.

4350
03:23:35,100 --> 03:23:35,580
Uh...

4351
03:23:35,580 --> 03:23:36,040
I don't...

4352
03:23:36,040 --> 03:23:37,580
How can I make it bounce, though?

4353
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:40,560
Maybe...

4354
03:23:40,560 --> 03:23:41,960
Off this wall.

4355
03:23:42,860 --> 03:23:43,160
Nope.

4356
03:23:54,110 --> 03:23:54,590
Okay.

4357
03:23:54,890 --> 03:23:55,670
Very cool.

4358
03:23:58,590 --> 03:23:59,670
Here's the other bomb.

4359
03:23:59,870 --> 03:24:00,150
Oh!

4360
03:24:01,190 --> 03:24:01,890
This one?

4361
03:24:03,690 --> 03:24:06,090
Actually, I feel like if I use the double barrel...

4362
03:24:06,090 --> 03:24:07,630
I can probably take it out.

4363
03:24:10,270 --> 03:24:12,210
I got a little electrocuted, but we're okay.

4364
03:24:15,210 --> 03:24:15,610
Nice!

4365
03:24:16,450 --> 03:24:16,850
Hey!

4366
03:24:17,290 --> 03:24:18,610
That one went pretty smoothly.

4367
03:24:18,910 --> 03:24:19,030
Okay.

4368
03:24:19,190 --> 03:24:19,590
F6.

4369
03:24:21,370 --> 03:24:22,770
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4370
03:24:22,930 --> 03:24:24,010
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

4371
03:24:33,350 --> 03:24:36,250
Yeah, right click with the shoddy is really good.

4372
03:24:37,630 --> 03:24:39,490
It's pretty dang good, yeah.

4373
03:24:39,490 --> 03:24:39,950
Okay.

4374
03:24:40,150 --> 03:24:42,190
Now once we get over there, I will save.

4375
03:24:42,470 --> 03:24:43,650
So we don't have to deal with these stupid...

4376
03:24:44,450 --> 03:24:45,170
Turrets again.

4377
03:24:45,410 --> 03:24:45,750
I hate.

4378
03:24:51,980 --> 03:24:53,220
Worth the two ammo.

4379
03:24:53,480 --> 03:24:53,980
So true.

4380
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:58,500
Is there even anything in here, though?

4381
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:05,000
He was waiting for...

4382
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:05,280
Ah!

4383
03:25:12,370 --> 03:25:15,810
Oh, he even left the spray paint.

4384
03:25:16,010 --> 03:25:17,090
Wait, um...

4385
03:25:17,090 --> 03:25:17,290
Tea.

4386
03:25:19,730 --> 03:25:20,850
You're dead, Minky.

4387
03:25:21,850 --> 03:25:22,870
You're dead.

4388
03:25:23,510 --> 03:25:24,590
Oh my god.

4389
03:25:26,370 --> 03:25:28,610
I wasted it on a stupid headcram.

4390
03:25:34,840 --> 03:25:35,640
All right.

4391
03:25:35,840 --> 03:25:37,180
I guess there's really nothing in here.

4392
03:25:38,400 --> 03:25:39,160
And we save.

4393
03:25:41,100 --> 03:25:41,620
Ah!

4394
03:25:42,940 --> 03:25:44,740
Headcrabs are the most dangerous in the game.

4395
03:25:44,860 --> 03:25:47,040
They are such little sneakies.

4396
03:25:48,060 --> 03:25:49,320
They're so annoying.

4397
03:25:51,160 --> 03:25:52,720
Sneaky little suckers.

4398
03:25:56,950 --> 03:25:57,390
Okay.

4399
03:25:58,670 --> 03:25:59,430
Oh.

4400
03:26:05,070 --> 03:26:06,430
Taking it easy.

4401
03:26:06,870 --> 03:26:07,510
What is that?

4402
03:26:18,330 --> 03:26:18,770
Reverse!

4403
03:26:18,890 --> 03:26:19,310
Reverse!

4404
03:26:20,150 --> 03:26:20,890
It's Goku.

4405
03:26:21,590 --> 03:26:22,310
Who is that?

4406
03:26:22,310 --> 03:26:22,330
Okay.

4407
03:26:25,090 --> 03:26:26,630
Oh, I think the door was closing.

4408
03:26:29,050 --> 03:26:29,570
Hmm.

4409
03:26:32,090 --> 03:26:33,290
Maybe I've taken it too easy.

4410
03:26:33,510 --> 03:26:33,650
Okay.

4411
03:26:33,790 --> 03:26:35,650
Full speed ahead now.

4412
03:26:37,310 --> 03:26:38,930
Full speed ahead.

4413
03:26:39,450 --> 03:26:40,090
Ducking cover.

4414
03:26:40,470 --> 03:26:42,150
Is that actually what you're supposed to do?

4415
03:26:42,530 --> 03:26:43,250
Okay, here we go.

4416
03:26:49,580 --> 03:26:50,820
He doesn't notice me.

4417
03:26:52,120 --> 03:26:52,540
Oh!

4418
03:27:04,210 --> 03:27:05,190
That was so close.

4419
03:27:05,350 --> 03:27:06,150
Oh my god!

4420
03:27:06,150 --> 03:27:07,970
Wait, I almost died for real.

4421
03:27:17,110 --> 03:27:17,750
Oh!

4422
03:27:18,910 --> 03:27:19,870
Holy cow!

4423
03:27:20,170 --> 03:27:21,910
I almost died for real!

4424
03:27:24,270 --> 03:27:25,550
I almost...

4425
03:27:25,990 --> 03:27:27,050
How did he die?

4426
03:27:27,330 --> 03:27:28,230
I don't under...

4427
03:27:28,230 --> 03:27:29,910
I don't understand what happened.

4428
03:27:30,070 --> 03:27:30,930
But, um...

4429
03:27:30,930 --> 03:27:32,010
If it works...

4430
03:27:32,010 --> 03:27:33,890
He died because he was so intimidated.

4431
03:27:34,450 --> 03:27:35,870
By my...

4432
03:27:35,870 --> 03:27:36,990
You know...

4433
03:27:36,990 --> 03:27:38,250
Gaming prowess.

4434
03:27:38,970 --> 03:27:39,790
He said...

4435
03:27:39,790 --> 03:27:39,850
Whoa!

4436
03:27:40,630 --> 03:27:41,790
I thought you shot him.

4437
03:27:44,050 --> 03:27:44,730
Yeah!

4438
03:27:46,470 --> 03:27:47,570
Die, Freeman!

4439
03:27:51,810 --> 03:27:53,790
That's Phantom to you!

4440
03:27:55,390 --> 03:27:56,050
Okay.

4441
03:27:56,410 --> 03:27:57,090
Oh!

4442
03:27:57,210 --> 03:27:57,550
This is...

4443
03:27:57,550 --> 03:27:58,330
I think we're our...

4444
03:27:58,330 --> 03:27:58,490
No?

4445
03:27:59,210 --> 03:28:00,190
Actually, I'm not sure.

4446
03:28:02,750 --> 03:28:03,790
Grenades in the ready.

4447
03:28:06,370 --> 03:28:07,410
Die, Phantom.

4448
03:28:08,110 --> 03:28:09,390
You don't belong in this world.

4449
03:28:20,330 --> 03:28:20,390
Oh!

4450
03:28:21,470 --> 03:28:22,030
Uh...

4451
03:28:22,030 --> 03:28:22,810
Uh...

4452
03:28:22,810 --> 03:28:24,030
We're fine.

4453
03:28:25,110 --> 03:28:25,490
Nope.

4454
03:28:25,710 --> 03:28:26,110
We're not fine.

4455
03:28:39,650 --> 03:28:39,910
We're...

4456
03:28:39,910 --> 03:28:40,610
No, please!

4457
03:28:45,670 --> 03:28:47,550
Does not buy Minky's hand.

4458
03:28:47,710 --> 03:28:49,250
She was once again given flesh.

4459
03:28:50,490 --> 03:28:52,830
I was called here by...

4460
03:28:52,830 --> 03:28:53,290
Humans!

4461
03:28:55,210 --> 03:28:56,490
Who wished to...

4462
03:28:57,770 --> 03:28:58,710
It's stinking.

4463
03:28:59,550 --> 03:29:01,490
This guy's ruined my mood.

4464
03:29:09,100 --> 03:29:10,040
No prizes?

4465
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:10,580
No...

4466
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:11,720
No Christmas presents?

4467
03:29:16,360 --> 03:29:18,220
No Christmas presents at all.

4468
03:29:19,760 --> 03:29:20,940
So sad.

4469
03:29:24,840 --> 03:29:26,280
Look at the handprint there.

4470
03:29:26,680 --> 03:29:27,300
It's pretty epic.

4471
03:29:34,300 --> 03:29:34,980
Oh!

4472
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:36,160
I blew somebody up.

4473
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:45,360
Somebody is dead.

4474
03:29:49,620 --> 03:29:50,980
Wait, what's...

4475
03:29:52,180 --> 03:29:53,700
Which cart is that?

4476
03:29:54,260 --> 03:29:55,300
Whose is that?

4477
03:29:58,060 --> 03:30:00,820
Your autograph from Toho lost for giveaway right today!

4478
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:01,860
It's slightly banged up.

4479
03:30:02,020 --> 03:30:03,500
Thanks for being a swell gal.

4480
03:30:04,920 --> 03:30:05,400
Sorry.

4481
03:30:05,540 --> 03:30:06,680
It's a little banged up.

4482
03:30:08,460 --> 03:30:09,940
Might be tough for...

4483
03:30:09,940 --> 03:30:11,720
Shikishi to go in the mail.

4484
03:30:16,540 --> 03:30:17,360
Who's chirping?

4485
03:30:21,400 --> 03:30:21,880
Roger.

4486
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:21,960
Roger.

4487
03:30:26,580 --> 03:30:27,580
Good thing I...

4488
03:30:27,580 --> 03:30:28,140
Scones!

4489
03:30:29,300 --> 03:30:29,860
Hey!

4490
03:30:29,960 --> 03:30:31,120
How'd you know I was here?

4491
03:30:32,920 --> 03:30:33,640
Oh shit.

4492
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:35,180
We're fine.

4493
03:30:35,460 --> 03:30:35,560
Okay.

4494
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:38,040
And I reload.

4495
03:30:48,100 --> 03:30:49,060
Wall hacks.

4496
03:30:55,220 --> 03:30:55,780
Okay.

4497
03:30:57,360 --> 03:30:57,920
Okay.

4498
03:30:59,780 --> 03:31:00,500
All right.

4499
03:31:01,640 --> 03:31:02,200
Save.

4500
03:31:02,660 --> 03:31:02,840
All right.

4501
03:31:03,000 --> 03:31:03,200
Let's go.

4502
03:31:03,380 --> 03:31:04,340
You'd think they'd learn.

4503
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:05,040
I know.

4504
03:31:06,320 --> 03:31:08,180
They don't know who they're messing with.

4505
03:31:08,600 --> 03:31:10,560
Or rather, I think they do, but...

4506
03:31:10,560 --> 03:31:12,240
They're silly guys.

4507
03:31:13,940 --> 03:31:14,520
There's...

4508
03:31:16,020 --> 03:31:16,980
This is fine.

4509
03:31:17,560 --> 03:31:17,880
Oh.

4510
03:31:18,040 --> 03:31:18,500
There's no more?

4511
03:31:18,660 --> 03:31:18,840
Okay.

4512
03:31:20,010 --> 03:31:20,780
Who am I hearing?

4513
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:22,660
Oh!

4514
03:31:22,840 --> 03:31:23,420
That's...

4515
03:31:23,420 --> 03:31:25,240
That is a C4, right?

4516
03:31:25,420 --> 03:31:26,200
That's a C4?

4517
03:31:29,140 --> 03:31:29,720
That...

4518
03:31:30,030 --> 03:31:30,700
That is it?

4519
03:31:31,240 --> 03:31:31,820
Yes.

4520
03:31:43,750 --> 03:31:44,770
Explosives, baby!

4521
03:31:44,770 --> 03:31:45,290
We...

4522
03:31:45,950 --> 03:31:47,410
We love to see it.

4523
03:31:48,230 --> 03:31:51,030
I keep hearing a little creature, but...

4524
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:53,810
Around this area, but...

4525
03:31:57,070 --> 03:31:57,570
Peculiar.

4526
03:31:57,930 --> 03:31:58,090
Okay.

4527
03:32:04,280 --> 03:32:05,180
Is that...

4528
03:32:05,180 --> 03:32:06,040
My...

4529
03:32:06,040 --> 03:32:07,640
No, that's not mine.

4530
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:08,200
Where do I...

4531
03:32:08,200 --> 03:32:08,920
How do I get to there?

4532
03:32:11,540 --> 03:32:12,940
It's just us, don't worry.

4533
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:14,480
You sound so cute though.

4534
03:32:14,480 --> 03:32:15,320
He he.

4535
03:32:17,460 --> 03:32:17,980
Nevermind.

4536
03:32:19,200 --> 03:32:20,680
You don't need to growl at me.

4537
03:32:20,940 --> 03:32:22,060
I complimented you.

4538
03:32:23,100 --> 03:32:24,720
Oh, they're like in the air duct.

4539
03:32:27,880 --> 03:32:29,140
Oh, thanks.

4540
03:32:32,620 --> 03:32:34,020
She took it back.

4541
03:32:34,400 --> 03:32:35,660
Yeah, because did you hear it?

4542
03:32:37,020 --> 03:32:38,060
They're in the wall...

4543
03:32:38,060 --> 03:32:38,720
How do I...

4544
03:32:38,720 --> 03:32:40,320
How do I blow them?

4545
03:32:47,060 --> 03:32:47,480
Oh!

4546
03:32:48,620 --> 03:32:49,620
Aw, man.

4547
03:32:53,060 --> 03:32:53,980
I...

4548
03:32:55,180 --> 03:32:56,100
Uh...

4549
03:32:56,660 --> 03:32:58,140
Fire in the hole!

4550
03:32:59,980 --> 03:33:00,880
Oh, God.

4551
03:33:01,700 --> 03:33:03,400
Oh, I actually lived.

4552
03:33:05,900 --> 03:33:07,540
Fire in the hole!

4553
03:33:13,370 --> 03:33:14,370
The SMG?

4554
03:33:14,550 --> 03:33:15,190
Let's try it.

4555
03:33:24,300 --> 03:33:26,820
Peace and quiet, finally.

4556
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:28,560
All right.

4557
03:33:30,860 --> 03:33:32,600
So maybe I just jump on over.

4558
03:33:32,760 --> 03:33:32,900
Okay.

4559
03:33:33,360 --> 03:33:34,380
I made it...

4560
03:33:34,380 --> 03:33:35,260
I made it sound so difficult.

4561
03:33:35,640 --> 03:33:36,960
Peak Looney Tunes comedy.

4562
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:38,600
Wait!

4563
03:33:42,200 --> 03:33:43,280
So quiet.

4564
03:33:44,680 --> 03:33:45,220
Quiet.

4565
03:33:48,740 --> 03:33:49,660
Okie dokie.

4566
03:33:50,760 --> 03:33:51,320
Artichokey.

4567
03:33:52,280 --> 03:33:54,780
Would you still love hate us if we were a headcrab?

4568
03:33:54,780 --> 03:33:57,040
I actually think the headcrabs are very cute.

4569
03:33:57,400 --> 03:33:58,860
They look like horseshoe crabs.

4570
03:33:59,480 --> 03:34:00,920
So they're actually quite charming.

4571
03:34:01,400 --> 03:34:02,920
They're just annoying little...

4572
03:34:04,100 --> 03:34:04,620
bugs.

4573
03:34:07,280 --> 03:34:09,160
Okie dokie, chicken jockey!

4574
03:34:09,740 --> 03:34:11,020
That's not what I said!

4575
03:34:12,640 --> 03:34:14,160
Chicken jockey!

4576
03:34:15,960 --> 03:34:18,080
Flint and steel!

4577
03:34:18,080 --> 03:34:21,180
Chicken jockey!

4578
03:34:21,740 --> 03:34:24,060
I am Steve!

4579
03:34:29,840 --> 03:34:32,280
I'm still not over it.

4580
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:37,840
Readying my grenades!

4581
03:34:58,100 --> 03:34:58,840
Oh, ouch.

4582
03:34:59,180 --> 03:34:59,640
Wait, hold on.

4583
03:34:59,780 --> 03:35:00,060
Reload.

4584
03:35:09,340 --> 03:35:10,580
I think there'd be a wall.

4585
03:35:10,760 --> 03:35:12,500
Oh, a little further.

4586
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:14,740
Oh, no, no.

4587
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:15,300
A little.

4588
03:35:15,720 --> 03:35:16,080
And stop.

4589
03:35:16,460 --> 03:35:16,840
No, no.

4590
03:35:17,080 --> 03:35:17,600
Wait, no.

4591
03:35:17,800 --> 03:35:18,900
Back, back, back, back, back.

4592
03:35:19,680 --> 03:35:21,840
And, and, and this.

4593
03:35:22,320 --> 03:35:22,680
Perfect.

4594
03:35:22,680 --> 03:35:22,920
Perfect.

4595
03:35:26,800 --> 03:35:27,440
Okay.

4596
03:35:28,600 --> 03:35:29,240
Alright.

4597
03:35:34,430 --> 03:35:35,710
I don't see anybody.

4598
03:35:37,370 --> 03:35:38,330
First try.

4599
03:35:38,590 --> 03:35:43,410
It's like it's... It's like parking a truck, you know?

4600
03:35:43,570 --> 03:35:44,350
Parking a car.

4601
03:35:51,370 --> 03:35:52,010
Hmm.

4602
03:35:59,860 --> 03:36:01,600
I want to use that thing.

4603
03:36:01,940 --> 03:36:03,080
The big boy right there.

4604
03:36:04,360 --> 03:36:05,660
Oh, this part.

4605
03:36:06,580 --> 03:36:07,900
Okay, we're going to save it here.

4606
03:36:08,340 --> 03:36:09,780
And... Trap grenades.

4607
03:36:10,320 --> 03:36:10,500
Ah!

4608
03:36:10,800 --> 03:36:11,200
Ow!

4609
03:36:18,400 --> 03:36:20,080
Yeah, that seems about right.

4610
03:36:22,140 --> 03:36:23,340
Seems about right.

4611
03:36:25,640 --> 03:36:27,420
You think you're supposed to ram it?

4612
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:28,660
I don't think so.

4613
03:36:28,880 --> 03:36:29,640
Because they've been...

4614
03:36:29,640 --> 03:36:32,880
They've been pretty adamant about me lifting these up.

4615
03:36:33,380 --> 03:36:35,120
That's why I had to go through the other way.

4616
03:36:42,170 --> 03:36:43,850
Did you ever get your car fixed, Minto?

4617
03:36:44,090 --> 03:36:44,930
I got a new car!

4618
03:36:45,630 --> 03:36:46,110
Iguana.

4619
03:36:46,710 --> 03:36:48,490
Yeah, I had to get a whole new car.

4620
03:36:51,070 --> 03:36:52,450
You can crouch when using it?

4621
03:36:53,830 --> 03:36:54,270
Ah!

4622
03:37:43,460 --> 03:37:43,460
Ow!

4623
03:37:43,600 --> 03:37:44,140
Oh, god.

4624
03:37:44,220 --> 03:37:44,940
I'm taking so much damage.

4625
03:37:48,670 --> 03:37:49,530
You missed.

4626
03:37:57,550 --> 03:38:01,330
If I use a grenade, will I even be able to throw that far?

4627
03:38:01,510 --> 03:38:01,730
Let's see.

4628
03:38:03,270 --> 03:38:04,450
Okay, hide behind it.

4629
03:38:05,250 --> 03:38:05,690
Okay.

4630
03:38:05,990 --> 03:38:06,210
Oh.

4631
03:38:06,550 --> 03:38:06,970
Oh.

4632
03:38:07,590 --> 03:38:09,070
It's pretty good at taking...

4633
03:38:09,070 --> 03:38:09,370
Okay.

4634
03:38:10,930 --> 03:38:12,410
Run, hop, and throw the grenade!

4635
03:38:13,450 --> 03:38:13,690
Eh!

4636
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:19,770
Or...

4637
03:38:19,770 --> 03:38:21,490
Wait, is it fully covered?

4638
03:38:21,630 --> 03:38:23,070
Oh, the last one was, wasn't it?

4639
03:38:23,510 --> 03:38:24,790
Congrats on the new car!

4640
03:38:24,910 --> 03:38:26,150
I hope it lasts a long time for you.

4641
03:38:26,250 --> 03:38:26,870
Thank you!

4642
03:38:27,330 --> 03:38:28,510
I appreciate it.

4643
03:38:33,110 --> 03:38:34,570
Easier to rush close to it.

4644
03:38:34,870 --> 03:38:36,390
If I rush and, like, just...

4645
03:38:36,390 --> 03:38:37,350
Blast him!

4646
03:38:46,630 --> 03:38:47,110
There's

4647
03:38:52,420 --> 03:38:54,020
way more guys here than I thought!

4648
03:38:58,840 --> 03:38:59,320
Oh.

4649
03:38:59,540 --> 03:39:01,480
I think the guy actually came out from behind it.

4650
03:39:06,170 --> 03:39:07,030
No, he didn't.

4651
03:39:07,170 --> 03:39:07,870
I lied.

4652
03:39:10,950 --> 03:39:11,430
Okay.

4653
03:39:11,750 --> 03:39:11,990
Um.

4654
03:39:12,430 --> 03:39:12,610
Hmm.

4655
03:39:19,090 --> 03:39:19,590
Nice.

4656
03:39:23,550 --> 03:39:24,050
Okay.

4657
03:39:24,250 --> 03:39:24,550
Here we go.

4658
03:39:27,960 --> 03:39:28,460
Grenade.

4659
03:39:29,520 --> 03:39:31,240
I'm gonna run up and grenade him.

4660
03:39:39,410 --> 03:39:39,910
Wait.

4661
03:39:40,090 --> 03:39:40,210
Oops.

4662
03:39:41,710 --> 03:39:42,530
Is he dead?

4663
03:39:50,650 --> 03:39:52,330
I got him, and...

4664
03:39:52,330 --> 03:39:53,630
I got a little bit of me.

4665
03:39:57,270 --> 03:39:58,950
Because I'm feeling bad.

4666
03:39:59,870 --> 03:40:01,350
Makes me feel alive.

4667
03:40:04,710 --> 03:40:08,370
What's up with having all these crates if they don't even put anything in them?

4668
03:40:13,320 --> 03:40:13,840
Okay.

4669
03:40:17,500 --> 03:40:18,500
Okay, we're fine.

4670
03:40:20,020 --> 03:40:20,720
We're fine.

4671
03:40:22,340 --> 03:40:22,860
Why?

4672
03:40:23,760 --> 03:40:26,920
I don't know where to aim with this thing at all.

4673
03:40:28,020 --> 03:40:28,880
Moral support.

4674
03:40:31,100 --> 03:40:32,760
It's just like, it's nice decoration.

4675
03:40:33,140 --> 03:40:33,540
Really...

4676
03:40:33,540 --> 03:40:35,720
It makes the place feel less empty, that's for sure.

4677
03:40:37,560 --> 03:40:39,920
It's meant to give you cover, then you choose to rush into it.

4678
03:40:40,060 --> 03:40:40,400
Ah!

4679
03:40:41,140 --> 03:40:42,280
I see, I see, I see.

4680
03:40:43,120 --> 03:40:44,100
It's hard to aim.

4681
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:44,640
It is.

4682
03:40:45,760 --> 03:40:46,640
I think...

4683
03:40:46,640 --> 03:40:48,000
I'm just gonna save anyway.

4684
03:40:48,300 --> 03:40:48,980
I think we'll save.

4685
03:40:49,260 --> 03:40:50,400
A new save.

4686
03:40:50,760 --> 03:40:52,260
Instead of like a quick save.

4687
03:40:52,560 --> 03:40:52,740
You know?

4688
03:40:54,660 --> 03:40:57,240
Because we could always go back and do it better if we need to.

4689
03:40:59,520 --> 03:41:01,240
Now that I know there's three extra men.

4690
03:41:05,600 --> 03:41:06,040
Alrighty.

4691
03:41:10,140 --> 03:41:10,540
Oh!

4692
03:41:10,720 --> 03:41:11,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4693
03:41:11,980 --> 03:41:12,260
Wait.

4694
03:41:12,580 --> 03:41:13,020
Wait.

4695
03:41:13,020 --> 03:41:13,240
Wait.

4696
03:41:13,500 --> 03:41:13,820
Please.

4697
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:17,880
What is here?

4698
03:41:18,180 --> 03:41:19,700
We have our own little elevator.

4699
03:41:20,340 --> 03:41:21,600
And some stuff.

4700
03:41:22,340 --> 03:41:23,460
Back it up.

4701
03:41:23,660 --> 03:41:24,600
Back it up.

4702
03:41:25,020 --> 03:41:25,880
Some C4.

4703
03:41:28,260 --> 03:41:29,200
Okay, never mind.

4704
03:41:29,280 --> 03:41:30,100
I changed my mind.

4705
03:41:43,620 --> 03:41:45,100
Okay, so how do I use this?

4706
03:41:45,200 --> 03:41:45,560
I press...

4707
03:41:46,280 --> 03:41:46,880
Left?

4708
03:41:48,080 --> 03:41:49,280
And then...

4709
03:41:58,230 --> 03:41:59,390
Then right?

4710
03:41:59,970 --> 03:42:01,770
Left to drop, right to detonate.

4711
03:42:08,360 --> 03:42:08,960
Okay.

4712
03:42:09,560 --> 03:42:10,280
Did that work?

4713
03:42:11,300 --> 03:42:12,220
Guess we'll see.

4714
03:42:13,860 --> 03:42:15,860
Now that's how you use it.

4715
03:42:16,880 --> 03:42:17,580
And...

4716
03:42:17,580 --> 03:42:18,020
Oh.

4717
03:42:19,960 --> 03:42:21,460
Um, I don't think it worked.

4718
03:42:21,820 --> 03:42:22,960
How did I miss?

4719
03:42:23,080 --> 03:42:24,380
How did I miss?

4720
03:42:26,800 --> 03:42:27,500
Um...

4721
03:42:30,120 --> 03:42:31,960
Oh, it's right there!

4722
03:42:33,380 --> 03:42:34,080
Ah.

4723
03:42:37,060 --> 03:42:37,760
Okay.

4724
03:42:45,220 --> 03:42:46,980
You can't pick it up, you guys.

4725
03:42:47,940 --> 03:42:49,460
Apparently, you can only do that in multiplayer.

4726
03:42:51,100 --> 03:42:53,240
Oh, set the elevator up without me.

4727
03:42:53,400 --> 03:42:54,740
Oh, I guess that could have been an option, huh?

4728
03:43:03,940 --> 03:43:05,840
Maybe there was something down there.

4729
03:43:07,080 --> 03:43:09,780
I don't know how that worked.

4730
03:43:12,960 --> 03:43:13,840
Holy cow.

4731
03:43:14,060 --> 03:43:14,160
Okay.

4732
03:43:14,160 --> 03:43:15,300
That should be good.

4733
03:43:15,600 --> 03:43:16,540
There we go.

4734
03:43:21,590 --> 03:43:23,370
Oh, my ears!

4735
03:43:24,330 --> 03:43:25,010
Wow!

4736
03:43:26,790 --> 03:43:27,470
Wow!

4737
03:43:27,810 --> 03:43:28,030
Okay.

4738
03:43:36,800 --> 03:43:38,400
And they gave us an extra.

4739
03:43:38,680 --> 03:43:39,600
I needed two, though.

4740
03:43:42,990 --> 03:43:44,710
What happened here?

4741
03:43:44,950 --> 03:43:45,270
Eww!

4742
03:43:49,550 --> 03:43:51,610
What happened here?

4743
03:43:53,710 --> 03:43:54,430
Nice.

4744
03:44:08,960 --> 03:44:09,680
Asshole.

4745
03:44:15,440 --> 03:44:16,160
Oh!

4746
03:44:16,580 --> 03:44:16,960
Oh!

4747
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:18,280
Oh!

4748
03:44:18,740 --> 03:44:20,680
This is where we're riding the train to!

4749
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:25,300
Wait, what?

4750
03:44:25,300 --> 03:44:25,380
What is it?

4751
03:44:27,400 --> 03:44:28,100
What's up?

4752
03:44:32,300 --> 03:44:36,040
Oh, oh, we can see more.

4753
03:44:40,620 --> 03:44:43,060
Okay, that doesn't look so good.

4754
03:44:45,140 --> 03:44:47,300
Not, not much, baby.

4755
03:44:49,140 --> 03:44:50,580
Who you calling baby?

4756
03:44:52,440 --> 03:44:54,460
Nothing much, just watching Minto.

4757
03:44:58,080 --> 03:44:59,220
It's safe, actually?

4758
03:44:59,360 --> 03:44:59,760
It is?

4759
03:45:00,120 --> 03:45:01,860
I don't know if I trust you guys.

4760
03:45:03,460 --> 03:45:03,840
Who you trying?

4761
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:04,940
Who you calling baby?

4762
03:45:07,140 --> 03:45:10,260
There's something really unsettling about gore from old games like this.

4763
03:45:11,320 --> 03:45:14,240
This game and Soldier of Fortune...

4764
03:45:15,920 --> 03:45:16,440
S...s...squick?

4765
03:45:17,340 --> 03:45:18,300
What's that mean?

4766
03:45:21,340 --> 03:45:23,080
Make you feel gross?

4767
03:45:25,080 --> 03:45:26,260
Usps.

4768
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:27,300
Usps.

4769
03:45:27,460 --> 03:45:28,700
Us, the wisps.

4770
03:45:29,420 --> 03:45:30,120
Usps.

4771
03:45:30,660 --> 03:45:31,440
Usps.

4772
03:45:37,700 --> 03:45:38,880
It means gross.

4773
03:45:40,740 --> 03:45:41,340
Usps.

4774
03:45:41,340 --> 03:45:41,960
Usps.

4775
03:45:43,120 --> 03:45:43,560
Usps.

4776
03:45:49,160 --> 03:45:50,080
What's in there?

4777
03:45:51,800 --> 03:45:52,240
Mysterious.

4778
03:45:52,480 --> 03:45:53,180
Is that a secret?

4779
03:45:54,280 --> 03:45:55,620
Could I have jumped onto that?

4780
03:45:55,780 --> 03:45:56,880
Then how would I get back on here?

4781
03:45:56,880 --> 03:45:58,260
I'm getting dizzy.

4782
03:45:58,700 --> 03:45:58,900
I'm getting dizzy.

4783
03:45:58,900 --> 03:46:00,300
Could you think of a different way to do it?

4784
03:46:07,790 --> 03:46:09,230
I think, actually.

4785
03:46:10,130 --> 03:46:10,470
Okay.

4786
03:46:12,570 --> 03:46:13,690
Full speed!

4787
03:46:14,410 --> 03:46:14,850
Ah!

4788
03:46:15,150 --> 03:46:16,110
Oh, it is fine.

4789
03:46:21,020 --> 03:46:21,840
Hold on.

4790
03:46:21,840 --> 03:46:21,860
Hold on.

4791
03:46:22,820 --> 03:46:23,880
One moment, please.

4792
03:46:25,840 --> 03:46:26,100
Oh.

4793
03:46:34,090 --> 03:46:35,370
Just a little tickle.

4794
03:46:37,470 --> 03:46:40,270
Actually, I think it got rid of the armor that I had.

4795
03:46:40,470 --> 03:46:41,490
I think it didn't actually.

4796
03:46:44,210 --> 03:46:45,550
I don't think...

4797
03:46:45,550 --> 03:46:47,550
I don't think...

4798
03:47:01,490 --> 03:47:03,550
There will be more head to refill.

4799
03:47:03,830 --> 03:47:04,330
So true.

4800
03:47:14,320 --> 03:47:15,360
Can they just kill me?

4801
03:47:18,920 --> 03:47:19,440
Wow!

4802
03:47:20,360 --> 03:47:21,600
Where'd you come from?

4803
03:47:28,580 --> 03:47:30,020
Why'd you blow up?

4804
03:47:33,660 --> 03:47:35,840
They're so grenade happy.

4805
03:47:36,880 --> 03:47:38,440
They grenaded themselves.

4806
03:47:39,640 --> 03:47:40,800
They're such sillies.

4807
03:47:45,340 --> 03:47:47,860
Now this part's gonna be a little tricky, maybe.

4808
03:47:52,560 --> 03:47:53,940
Oh wait, I'm gonna reload.

4809
03:47:55,160 --> 03:47:55,580
Haha.

4810
03:47:56,480 --> 03:47:58,140
He shot a grenade into the box.

4811
03:47:58,440 --> 03:47:58,580
Haha.

4812
03:47:59,440 --> 03:47:59,660
Alright.

4813
03:48:03,220 --> 03:48:03,640
Woo!

4814
03:48:04,020 --> 03:48:04,440
Okay.

4815
03:48:08,230 --> 03:48:08,950
Full speed!

4816
03:48:09,610 --> 03:48:10,030
Nice.

4817
03:48:11,970 --> 03:48:12,950
That wasn't so bad.

4818
03:48:13,290 --> 03:48:13,770
Oh my gosh!

4819
03:48:13,830 --> 03:48:15,070
This is the best part of the ride!

4820
03:48:15,410 --> 03:48:15,950
And then...

4821
03:48:15,950 --> 03:48:16,730
Okay, this is...

4822
03:48:16,730 --> 03:48:17,350
Oh my gosh.

4823
03:48:17,510 --> 03:48:18,550
You guys know...

4824
03:48:18,550 --> 03:48:20,110
You guys know Splash Mountain?

4825
03:48:20,110 --> 03:48:21,650
That's what this is giving me vibes.

4826
03:48:21,750 --> 03:48:24,210
And then on the left side, you see the little rabbit.

4827
03:48:24,210 --> 03:48:25,270
And he's like, Please no!

4828
03:48:25,410 --> 03:48:26,910
Don't throw me into the...

4829
03:48:26,910 --> 03:48:27,970
Into the patch!

4830
03:48:28,230 --> 03:48:28,690
Into the patch!

4831
03:48:28,690 --> 03:48:29,070
And the...

4832
03:48:29,070 --> 03:48:30,210
And the fox is like...

4833
03:48:30,210 --> 03:48:32,230
I'm gonna throw you into the patch.

4834
03:48:32,470 --> 03:48:34,310
That's some fine driving, Dr. Phantom.

4835
03:48:34,670 --> 03:48:35,150
Thank you!

4836
03:48:36,570 --> 03:48:37,090
Oh.

4837
03:48:42,820 --> 03:48:44,060
Okay, interesting.

4838
03:48:46,580 --> 03:48:48,420
What do we have here?

4839
03:48:49,700 --> 03:48:50,360
Oh!

4840
03:48:50,700 --> 03:48:51,080
Oh!

4841
03:48:51,200 --> 03:48:52,220
That's what we have here!

4842
03:48:53,400 --> 03:48:54,620
Can I just...

4843
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:54,880
Shoot it?

4844
03:48:57,880 --> 03:48:58,960
I messed up.

4845
03:48:59,240 --> 03:49:00,040
I messed up.

4846
03:49:04,800 --> 03:49:06,980
But the other ones aren't active, so...

4847
03:49:09,280 --> 03:49:10,180
Should've doubled.

4848
03:49:10,360 --> 03:49:11,100
I know...

4849
03:49:11,100 --> 03:49:11,700
I thought...

4850
03:49:11,700 --> 03:49:13,180
I was close enough to get a single.

4851
03:49:22,950 --> 03:49:24,350
And then this is...

4852
03:49:24,350 --> 03:49:24,690
No?

4853
03:49:29,830 --> 03:49:30,690
Full speed!

4854
03:49:32,530 --> 03:49:33,290
Oh my god.

4855
03:49:34,550 --> 03:49:35,070
Ah!

4856
03:49:35,410 --> 03:49:35,510
Ah!

4857
03:49:36,470 --> 03:49:36,990
Ah!

4858
03:49:37,470 --> 03:49:37,770
Ah!

4859
03:49:37,770 --> 03:49:38,070
There we go.

4860
03:49:38,630 --> 03:49:40,350
I'm getting ahead of myself.

4861
03:49:40,550 --> 03:49:41,290
I'm full speed!

4862
03:49:43,970 --> 03:49:45,230
Oh, I can crouch!

4863
03:49:45,550 --> 03:49:45,790
Oh.

4864
03:49:59,420 --> 03:50:02,060
I think they wanted you to crouch the whole time.

4865
03:50:03,340 --> 03:50:04,620
They're like, Hey, bozo.

4866
03:50:04,940 --> 03:50:06,820
Why don't you just crouch through it?

4867
03:50:07,660 --> 03:50:08,060
Yeah.

4868
03:50:08,540 --> 03:50:08,940
Stupid.

4869
03:50:13,820 --> 03:50:14,380
Hey!

4870
03:50:19,490 --> 03:50:21,110
Oh, he actually tried this time.

4871
03:50:43,730 --> 03:50:44,730
That was a waste.

4872
03:50:44,890 --> 03:50:45,410
Wait, wait, wait.

4873
03:50:45,490 --> 03:50:45,750
Go back.

4874
03:50:47,550 --> 03:50:48,930
There's some green stuff.

4875
03:50:49,550 --> 03:50:50,730
Part of Splash Mountain.

4876
03:50:50,930 --> 03:50:52,310
With the laser beams!

4877
03:50:52,870 --> 03:50:53,210
Yeah.

4878
03:50:54,130 --> 03:50:55,750
He just ate them, yeah.

4879
03:50:59,350 --> 03:51:00,410
Oh, cool!

4880
03:51:01,410 --> 03:51:02,290
Sorry, I like...

4881
03:51:02,290 --> 03:51:04,130
I like little details like that.

4882
03:51:04,910 --> 03:51:06,210
Just lock him from here.

4883
03:51:11,480 --> 03:51:12,340
There we go.

4884
03:51:12,580 --> 03:51:14,700
Now he'll never be a bother to us again.

4885
03:51:18,220 --> 03:51:20,440
You're too bothersome for this world.

4886
03:51:21,180 --> 03:51:21,720
Oh.

4887
03:51:25,740 --> 03:51:26,320
Okay.

4888
03:51:28,740 --> 03:51:29,320
Okay.

4889
03:51:30,700 --> 03:51:31,540
What did he do?

4890
03:51:31,640 --> 03:51:33,420
He shot like six rockets at us!

4891
03:51:33,520 --> 03:51:33,920
What do you mean?

4892
03:51:34,140 --> 03:51:35,020
What did he do?

4893
03:51:35,600 --> 03:51:36,580
My man's innocent!

4894
03:51:51,620 --> 03:51:52,060
Oh!

4895
03:51:52,320 --> 03:51:52,720
Ouch!

4896
03:51:53,740 --> 03:51:54,180
Oh!

4897
03:52:00,320 --> 03:52:00,760
Save!

4898
03:52:00,900 --> 03:52:01,320
Oh, I...

4899
03:52:01,320 --> 03:52:01,840
Oh, wow!

4900
03:52:02,080 --> 03:52:03,140
Oh, they move!

4901
03:52:05,100 --> 03:52:05,540
Whoa!

4902
03:52:06,600 --> 03:52:07,460
Can I just crouch here?

4903
03:52:10,020 --> 03:52:10,560
Oh...

4904
03:52:11,560 --> 03:52:12,100
Oh...

4905
03:52:13,400 --> 03:52:14,200
You can.

4906
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:18,420
I'll have impeccable comedic timing.

4907
03:52:19,020 --> 03:52:19,860
I'm not even...

4908
03:52:19,860 --> 03:52:21,020
I'm not even trying...

4909
03:52:21,680 --> 03:52:22,220
Wait...

4910
03:52:22,220 --> 03:52:23,060
Oh, no!

4911
03:52:23,220 --> 03:52:24,300
Don't make me do this again!

4912
03:52:25,100 --> 03:52:25,860
Go back!

4913
03:52:26,000 --> 03:52:26,260
Go back!

4914
03:52:37,280 --> 03:52:39,400
Sorry, I can't read your name.

4915
03:52:39,980 --> 03:52:40,820
I'm stupid.

4916
03:52:48,620 --> 03:52:49,620
Here's the drop!

4917
03:52:50,060 --> 03:52:51,160
Wait, here's the drop.

4918
03:52:51,380 --> 03:52:53,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4919
03:52:54,460 --> 03:52:55,860
That doesn't seem good.

4920
03:53:03,540 --> 03:53:07,680
The elevator's down there.

4921
03:53:08,020 --> 03:53:09,960
And I'm up here!

4922
03:53:15,980 --> 03:53:17,340
Come on!

4923
03:53:35,090 --> 03:53:37,710
If I do this...

4924
03:53:42,850 --> 03:53:44,230
Friendly fire!

4925
03:53:50,030 --> 03:53:51,430
Oh, I'm so dead.

4926
03:54:00,110 --> 03:54:02,750
If there's not another one...

4927
03:54:07,230 --> 03:54:08,090
Just kidding.

4928
03:54:08,590 --> 03:54:09,690
Oh, there he is!

4929
03:54:15,570 --> 03:54:16,790
What's swirling over there?

4930
03:54:16,890 --> 03:54:17,070
Oh!

4931
03:54:17,370 --> 03:54:18,710
Oh, the turret.

4932
03:54:18,890 --> 03:54:19,670
That's what's swirling.

4933
03:54:21,150 --> 03:54:21,690
Oh,

4934
03:54:37,860 --> 03:54:37,920
no!

4935
03:54:38,140 --> 03:54:38,320
Wait!

4936
03:54:39,420 --> 03:54:40,440
Oh, thank goodness.

4937
03:54:40,560 --> 03:54:41,360
It stops by itself.

4938
03:54:41,940 --> 03:54:42,960
Can you imagine?

4939
03:54:44,400 --> 03:54:46,300
What if I did this?

4940
03:54:55,020 --> 03:54:56,100
Does that take care of...

4941
03:54:56,100 --> 03:54:56,200
Oh!

4942
03:54:57,180 --> 03:54:58,620
Takes care of me, I guess.

4943
03:55:04,300 --> 03:55:06,000
Okay, hold on.

4944
03:55:10,360 --> 03:55:11,340
Look out below!

4945
03:55:13,120 --> 03:55:13,780
All right.

4946
03:55:16,300 --> 03:55:17,840
These ladders are so tricky.

4947
03:55:21,260 --> 03:55:22,260
Okay, then it loads.

4948
03:55:22,720 --> 03:55:24,320
I wish I would blow these up, though.

4949
03:55:24,440 --> 03:55:24,560
No?

4950
03:55:30,980 --> 03:55:32,140
I feel like I should.

4951
03:55:36,960 --> 03:55:37,800
Hold on.

4952
03:55:37,800 --> 03:55:37,840
Hold on.

4953
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:39,540
Maybe if I, like...

4954
03:55:39,540 --> 03:55:40,340
What if I do this?

4955
03:55:42,240 --> 03:55:42,660
Oh!

4956
03:55:43,680 --> 03:55:45,400
Wait, but then it doesn't activate...

4957
03:55:45,400 --> 03:55:46,240
And shoot those guys.

4958
03:55:46,720 --> 03:55:48,460
I kind of want them to murder the other guys.

4959
03:55:57,110 --> 03:55:58,530
I hope you had a nice fall.

4960
03:56:01,310 --> 03:56:02,510
I'm too good at my job.

4961
03:56:03,830 --> 03:56:05,850
I'm just too good at what I do.

4962
03:56:06,410 --> 03:56:08,430
Okay, I know there's two of them now, though, at least.

4963
03:56:08,550 --> 03:56:08,870
Look at...

4964
03:56:08,870 --> 03:56:09,350
Look at that.

4965
03:56:10,370 --> 03:56:11,130
He's so...

4966
03:56:11,590 --> 03:56:13,670
He's so sensually hugging the wall.

4967
03:56:14,190 --> 03:56:14,570
What are you...

4968
03:56:14,570 --> 03:56:15,330
What are you trying to do?

4969
03:56:15,410 --> 03:56:16,370
Seduce me or something?

4970
03:56:16,390 --> 03:56:17,030
You creepy!

4971
03:56:17,470 --> 03:56:18,230
You creep!

4972
03:56:20,090 --> 03:56:21,690
He's like, Come here, baby.

4973
03:56:23,170 --> 03:56:24,410
Come here, baby.

4974
03:56:24,670 --> 03:56:24,910
Oh, yeah.

4975
03:56:25,150 --> 03:56:25,590
Let's...

4976
03:56:25,590 --> 03:56:26,490
Let's light him up.

4977
03:56:26,930 --> 03:56:27,070
Wait.

4978
03:56:29,250 --> 03:56:30,590
I'm out of grenades!

4979
03:56:31,230 --> 03:56:31,610
Uh-oh.

4980
03:56:33,130 --> 03:56:34,630
I'm out of grenades.

4981
03:56:35,330 --> 03:56:36,590
I know there's some in there, no?

4982
03:56:42,270 --> 03:56:43,550
Use the grenade launcher.

4983
03:56:44,090 --> 03:56:44,910
So true.

4984
03:56:50,690 --> 03:56:51,730
Did I get both of them?

4985
03:56:52,750 --> 03:56:53,590
I guess we'll hear.

4986
03:56:54,570 --> 03:56:56,810
The beeping of the turrets is so...

4987
03:56:58,090 --> 03:56:58,810
Stinking annoying.

4988
03:56:59,530 --> 03:56:59,790
Ouch!

4989
03:57:01,450 --> 03:57:01,810
How

4990
03:57:05,960 --> 03:57:07,500
did my health get so low?

4991
03:57:07,600 --> 03:57:08,780
Wait, I think it was already pretty low.

4992
03:57:09,100 --> 03:57:09,220
Ah!

4993
03:57:13,190 --> 03:57:14,010
Okay, hold on.

4994
03:57:14,170 --> 03:57:14,330
Okay.

4995
03:57:14,610 --> 03:57:14,770
Alright.

4996
03:57:14,970 --> 03:57:15,390
We're good.

4997
03:57:15,450 --> 03:57:15,710
We're good.

4998
03:57:15,850 --> 03:57:16,410
We got this.

4999
03:57:17,130 --> 03:57:17,830
We got this.

5000
03:57:17,930 --> 03:57:18,350
We got this.

5001
03:57:25,320 --> 03:57:26,780
Yeah, I'll just do what I did before.

5002
03:57:28,040 --> 03:57:29,140
And I'll shoot you.

5003
03:57:30,020 --> 03:57:31,720
And then we'll blow up in here.

5004
03:57:34,900 --> 03:57:35,920
And then I'm...

5005
03:57:37,300 --> 03:57:37,800
Oh!

5006
03:57:38,300 --> 03:57:38,940
Oh, I...

5007
03:57:38,940 --> 03:57:39,580
I missed it.

5008
03:57:39,860 --> 03:57:39,980
Oh!

5009
03:57:41,180 --> 03:57:42,100
Wait, I'm too good.

5010
03:57:43,680 --> 03:57:44,740
I'm too good!

5011
03:57:44,740 --> 03:57:45,020
I'm too good!

5012
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:47,300
And...

5013
03:57:47,300 --> 03:57:47,480
Yes!

5014
03:57:49,260 --> 03:57:50,600
We're gaming, we're gaming.

5015
03:57:51,020 --> 03:57:51,600
Oh, wait.

5016
03:57:51,640 --> 03:57:52,100
There's one more.

5017
03:57:52,100 --> 03:57:54,580
I don't like how it's switched to the...

5018
03:57:55,420 --> 03:57:55,620
Oh!

5019
03:57:57,840 --> 03:57:58,560
Minto Gaming.

5020
03:58:01,900 --> 03:58:03,120
Minto Gaming!

5021
03:58:03,840 --> 03:58:04,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5022
03:58:05,120 --> 03:58:07,760
How many grenades can I carry if I...

5023
03:58:07,760 --> 03:58:09,320
Already am maxed?

5024
03:58:11,280 --> 03:58:11,720
Ten?

5025
03:58:12,280 --> 03:58:12,940
What?

5026
03:58:13,360 --> 03:58:14,180
Okay.

5027
03:58:16,580 --> 03:58:17,020
Okay!

5028
03:58:19,800 --> 03:58:20,240
Save!

5029
03:58:21,560 --> 03:58:23,200
Oh, it's broken!

5030
03:58:24,060 --> 03:58:24,440
Oh, no!

5031
03:58:25,520 --> 03:58:25,860
Wait!

5032
03:58:26,540 --> 03:58:27,500
What do we do?

5033
03:58:30,060 --> 03:58:30,540
Um...

5034
03:58:32,600 --> 03:58:33,080
Uh...

5035
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:34,300
What does that mean?

5036
03:58:34,460 --> 03:58:35,580
This is not...

5037
03:58:35,840 --> 03:58:36,360
It's still electric.

5038
03:58:40,920 --> 03:58:41,400
Hmm...

5039
03:58:41,400 --> 03:58:42,980
We need to find another choo-choo ride.

5040
03:58:50,360 --> 03:58:51,380
I saw him.

5041
03:58:51,560 --> 03:58:52,560
I don't know if he saw me.

5042
03:58:52,820 --> 03:58:53,220
Oh!

5043
03:58:53,360 --> 03:58:53,840
Oh!

5044
03:58:53,840 --> 03:58:53,960
Oh!

5045
03:58:53,960 --> 03:58:54,300
Oh!

5046
03:58:54,840 --> 03:58:55,320
Oh!

5047
03:58:55,320 --> 03:58:55,380
Oh!

5048
03:58:55,380 --> 03:58:55,420
Oh!

5049
03:58:58,960 --> 03:59:01,840
He's the most perfect aim in the world!

5050
03:59:08,160 --> 03:59:09,640
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5051
03:59:11,100 --> 03:59:12,140
Holy cow!

5052
03:59:14,440 --> 03:59:15,120
Okay.

5053
03:59:15,480 --> 03:59:15,780
Alright.

5054
03:59:16,100 --> 03:59:17,000
Let's get his ass.

5055
03:59:20,120 --> 03:59:21,600
Oh, he still got me.

5056
03:59:22,600 --> 03:59:23,640
He's hacking.

5057
03:59:26,880 --> 03:59:27,560
Medic!

5058
03:59:30,040 --> 03:59:31,180
That was pretty bad.

5059
03:59:31,280 --> 03:59:31,820
Not gonna lie.

5060
03:59:32,840 --> 03:59:33,700
That was...

5061
03:59:33,700 --> 03:59:33,900
Oh!

5062
03:59:36,900 --> 03:59:39,080
I hate this thing!

5063
03:59:40,060 --> 03:59:41,400
Oh, my God!

5064
03:59:47,000 --> 03:59:47,580
Oh!

5065
03:59:52,230 --> 03:59:54,570
If they can't see me, I can't see them, dars!

5066
03:59:55,070 --> 03:59:55,150
Oh.

5067
03:59:56,510 --> 03:59:57,050
Where'd he go?

5068
04:00:12,940 --> 04:00:13,540
Oh!

5069
04:00:13,720 --> 04:00:14,700
Oh, I got him, though.

5070
04:00:15,080 --> 04:00:15,120
Oh!

5071
04:00:16,980 --> 04:00:17,520
Okay.

5072
04:00:18,040 --> 04:00:19,340
Got him before he could throw it.

5073
04:00:19,560 --> 04:00:19,780
Yeah!

5074
04:00:20,220 --> 04:00:23,460
This is some fear levels of AI destroying the player.

5075
04:00:26,400 --> 04:00:26,940
Okay.

5076
04:00:36,220 --> 04:00:37,320
You should play fear.

5077
04:00:37,440 --> 04:00:38,140
I've actually played...

5078
04:00:39,400 --> 04:00:39,940
Oh!

5079
04:00:40,120 --> 04:00:40,460
Oh!

5080
04:00:40,680 --> 04:00:40,940
Oh!

5081
04:00:40,940 --> 04:00:41,140
Oh!

5082
04:00:41,500 --> 04:00:41,820
Oh!

5083
04:00:41,820 --> 04:00:42,860
I've played fear before.

5084
04:00:46,980 --> 04:00:47,900
God damn.

5085
04:00:50,620 --> 04:00:51,160
Um...

5086
04:01:05,340 --> 04:01:05,980
Ouch!

5087
04:01:06,180 --> 04:01:06,340
Ouch!

5088
04:01:07,760 --> 04:01:08,240
Wait!

5089
04:01:11,730 --> 04:01:12,370
Okay.

5090
04:01:16,470 --> 04:01:17,670
So close.

5091
04:01:19,510 --> 04:01:20,790
The knockback.

5092
04:01:21,050 --> 04:01:21,310
I know!

5093
04:01:22,030 --> 04:01:22,350
Alright.

5094
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:22,770
Okay.

5095
04:01:23,050 --> 04:01:23,170
Alright.

5096
04:01:25,050 --> 04:01:25,690
Oh,

5097
04:01:47,140 --> 04:01:47,540
I can...

5098
04:01:47,540 --> 04:01:48,160
Should I...

5099
04:01:48,160 --> 04:01:49,200
Maybe throw it, though?

5100
04:01:49,780 --> 04:01:50,380
Alright.

5101
04:01:52,420 --> 04:01:53,240
Oh, my God.

5102
04:01:53,240 --> 04:01:53,260
What?

5103
04:01:59,280 --> 04:02:00,960
Oh, I don't think that worked.

5104
04:02:02,020 --> 04:02:02,500
Sorry.

5105
04:02:04,260 --> 04:02:05,080
Okay, hold on.

5106
04:02:19,130 --> 04:02:20,850
It will only kill him if it gets in the hole.

5107
04:02:21,630 --> 04:02:21,830
Yeah.

5108
04:02:22,590 --> 04:02:23,270
I know.

5109
04:02:25,850 --> 04:02:26,330
Yeah.

5110
04:02:27,950 --> 04:02:28,650
I know.

5111
04:02:41,380 --> 04:02:42,820
Try the launcher instead.

5112
04:02:43,060 --> 04:02:43,280
Maybe.

5113
04:02:43,880 --> 04:02:45,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

5114
04:02:45,440 --> 04:02:47,060
I got stuck on the thing!

5115
04:02:47,860 --> 04:02:49,500
I got stuck on the ledge!

5116
04:02:49,640 --> 04:02:50,000
Oh, yeah.

5117
04:02:50,740 --> 04:02:50,940
Okay.

5118
04:02:56,460 --> 04:02:56,980
Okay.

5119
04:02:57,580 --> 04:02:58,940
Actually, we took no damage there.

5120
04:02:59,020 --> 04:02:59,560
That was pretty good.

5121
04:03:01,220 --> 04:03:01,740
Okay.

5122
04:03:02,540 --> 04:03:03,500
I'm gonna save.

5123
04:03:08,920 --> 04:03:10,460
I'm, like, here.

5124
04:03:12,680 --> 04:03:13,200
Oh!

5125
04:03:14,420 --> 04:03:15,800
Okay, a little lower.

5126
04:03:17,340 --> 04:03:17,760
Oh!

5127
04:03:18,780 --> 04:03:18,920
Oh!

5128
04:03:22,970 --> 04:03:23,570
Wait.

5129
04:03:23,730 --> 04:03:23,730
Wait.

5130
04:03:23,750 --> 04:03:23,750
Hold up.

5131
04:03:25,430 --> 04:03:26,910
I think he's down.

5132
04:03:30,990 --> 04:03:33,530
Salmi, thank you so much for the rain.

5133
04:03:34,630 --> 04:03:35,150
Wait.

5134
04:03:39,970 --> 04:03:43,570
Why did they build this whole thing and not put a roof on it?

5135
04:03:44,950 --> 04:03:45,770
Like what?

5136
04:03:46,150 --> 04:03:48,390
I think you're... you're... you're...

5137
04:03:51,810 --> 04:03:53,130
Oh, I think that's a radio.

5138
04:03:53,950 --> 04:03:56,150
They're like just doing themselves a dis... like...

5139
04:03:58,150 --> 04:03:58,690
Ventilation?

5140
04:03:58,970 --> 04:04:01,990
There's no ventil... There's no time for ventilation and water!

5141
04:04:03,410 --> 04:04:04,930
You sweat in there!

5142
04:04:05,210 --> 04:04:09,950
And you... you... enjoy it, mister!

5143
04:04:20,000 --> 04:04:20,580
Yeah!

5144
04:04:22,080 --> 04:04:25,400
I don't trust those anymore after the last one exploded on me.

5145
04:04:25,500 --> 04:04:27,260
Why is there blood coming out of that?

5146
04:04:30,200 --> 04:04:31,040
There we go.

5147
04:04:31,660 --> 04:04:32,380
Can I get in there?

5148
04:04:34,500 --> 04:04:35,300
Let's see.

5149
04:04:37,860 --> 04:04:39,540
Oh, that's maple syrup.

5150
04:04:40,020 --> 04:04:41,420
I don't think so!

5151
04:04:42,760 --> 04:04:43,160
Ugh!

5152
04:04:43,620 --> 04:04:45,520
The crouch jump makes me dizzy.

5153
04:04:47,360 --> 04:04:47,400
Ugh!

5154
04:04:47,820 --> 04:04:47,840
Ugh!

5155
04:04:52,340 --> 04:04:52,940
Dang.

5156
04:04:53,580 --> 04:04:54,900
It's orange juice.

5157
04:04:56,120 --> 04:04:57,800
I could go for some juice right now.

5158
04:04:59,460 --> 04:05:01,180
Actually, let's go with you instead.

5159
04:05:03,820 --> 04:05:05,860
It's called a tank top for a reason.

5160
04:05:06,220 --> 04:05:07,580
It's stinky in there.

5161
04:05:28,520 --> 04:05:29,420
Stop me!

5162
04:05:29,640 --> 04:05:31,160
I didn't do this sabotage!

5163
04:05:42,000 --> 04:05:42,620
Uh-oh!

5164
04:05:42,820 --> 04:05:43,360
Did you throw that?

5165
04:05:47,100 --> 04:05:47,620
No.

5166
04:05:50,140 --> 04:05:50,660
Stupid.

5167
04:05:58,570 --> 04:06:00,770
Yeah, I'm gonna kill you and your buddies.

5168
04:06:02,110 --> 04:06:02,590
Dummy.

5169
04:06:03,310 --> 04:06:05,050
You have killed, like, a lot of their buddies.

5170
04:06:05,270 --> 04:06:06,030
I've killed...

5171
04:06:06,890 --> 04:06:09,390
Name a buddy that I haven't killed.

5172
04:06:09,910 --> 04:06:11,070
What's that green thing up there?

5173
04:06:11,470 --> 04:06:13,170
Oh, we're, like, outside.

5174
04:06:13,990 --> 04:06:14,290
Whoa!

5175
04:06:15,150 --> 04:06:15,470
Whoa!

5176
04:06:15,470 --> 04:06:15,550
Wow!

5177
04:06:16,270 --> 04:06:17,250
It's so cute!

5178
04:06:17,610 --> 04:06:18,010
It's so cute!

5179
04:06:22,210 --> 04:06:23,630
Everything's so green out here.

5180
04:06:23,770 --> 04:06:24,530
Even my...

5181
04:06:24,530 --> 04:06:26,190
Even my crowbar is green.

5182
04:06:26,770 --> 04:06:27,910
Why is everything so green?

5183
04:06:31,740 --> 04:06:34,000
They must know it's a great color.

5184
04:06:35,140 --> 04:06:35,300
Wait!

5185
04:06:35,920 --> 04:06:36,480
Oh!

5186
04:06:39,880 --> 04:06:40,520
Ah!

5187
04:06:44,100 --> 04:06:45,380
Oh my god.

5188
04:06:46,960 --> 04:06:48,100
Um, just kill me.

5189
04:06:54,720 --> 04:06:55,120
Sneaky.

5190
04:06:56,200 --> 04:06:57,360
So evil, right?

5191
04:07:09,700 --> 04:07:10,100
Maybe.

5192
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:13,980
Oh, come on.

5193
04:07:22,690 --> 04:07:23,570
Wait, where am I?

5194
04:07:23,890 --> 04:07:24,690
Oh, there we go.

5195
04:07:26,430 --> 04:07:26,830
Freeman.

5196
04:07:35,340 --> 04:07:35,740
Wait.

5197
04:07:47,560 --> 04:07:48,240
Um, where are you going?

5198
04:07:51,280 --> 04:07:52,720
He was like, My buddy!

5199
04:08:03,440 --> 04:08:05,140
He scared me.

5200
04:08:10,500 --> 04:08:11,200
You know what?

5201
04:08:11,320 --> 04:08:11,640
This is...

5202
04:08:11,640 --> 04:08:12,220
This is the...

5203
04:08:12,220 --> 04:08:13,180
This works.

5204
04:08:15,060 --> 04:08:16,940
This works, I suppose.

5205
04:08:18,360 --> 04:08:19,620
Why didn't the sniper...

5206
04:08:19,620 --> 04:08:21,940
Why did the sniper only wait until I was on that side?

5207
04:08:22,400 --> 04:08:23,480
Kind of annoys me.

5208
04:08:24,520 --> 04:08:25,480
You think I can get him?

5209
04:08:27,860 --> 04:08:28,380
Hmm...

5210
04:08:28,380 --> 04:08:29,980
My gun is even green!

5211
04:08:29,980 --> 04:08:30,980
I mean...

5212
04:08:33,780 --> 04:08:34,280
Hiya!

5213
04:08:38,620 --> 04:08:39,880
That was so close!

5214
04:08:40,140 --> 04:08:41,120
That was basically a goal!

5215
04:08:41,480 --> 04:08:42,840
Just wanted to be with his buddy.

5216
04:08:45,080 --> 04:08:46,580
That was so close!

5217
04:08:47,400 --> 04:08:48,740
I don't think it got him though.

5218
04:08:54,240 --> 04:08:54,740
Oh!

5219
04:08:54,920 --> 04:08:56,360
I heard...

5220
04:08:56,360 --> 04:08:57,540
Death sound!

5221
04:08:57,820 --> 04:08:59,580
I heard death sound!

5222
04:09:00,520 --> 04:09:01,120
I heard death sound!

5223
04:09:01,120 --> 04:09:01,580
Yeah...

5224
04:09:01,880 --> 04:09:03,400
I heard a goal...

5225
04:09:06,200 --> 04:09:07,120
Nice!

5226
04:09:07,680 --> 04:09:09,540
Let me get my health and peace, please.

5227
04:09:12,640 --> 04:09:13,560
Nice!

5228
04:09:13,560 --> 04:09:14,020
Okay!

5229
04:09:15,540 --> 04:09:16,240
Um...

5230
04:09:18,460 --> 04:09:19,860
Anyway...

5231
04:09:31,650 --> 04:09:33,050
Oh

5232
04:09:36,430 --> 04:09:37,130
no...

5233
04:09:37,430 --> 04:09:38,110
Scones!

5234
04:09:49,210 --> 04:09:50,610
Medical...

5235
04:09:50,610 --> 04:09:51,410
Attention...

5236
04:09:54,290 --> 04:09:55,250
Is that it?

5237
04:09:57,510 --> 04:09:58,310
I bet...

5238
04:09:58,310 --> 04:09:59,050
I bet...

5239
04:09:59,050 --> 04:09:59,190
I bet...

5240
04:09:59,190 --> 04:10:01,990
Mr. Skippity Toilet himself is gonna be up in there.

5241
04:10:03,790 --> 04:10:04,190
Probably...

5242
04:10:04,190 --> 04:10:04,710
Oh gosh...

5243
04:10:04,710 --> 04:10:06,490
This looks like a battle arena for sure.

5244
04:10:13,610 --> 04:10:14,010
Uh...

5245
04:10:14,010 --> 04:10:18,430
My health is not looking so great, so I'm gonna save the game in a new save instead of a quick save.

5246
04:10:18,750 --> 04:10:20,490
I don't wanna overwrite anything, you know?

5247
04:10:20,490 --> 04:10:21,470
I don't know.

5248
04:10:24,350 --> 04:10:24,870
Oh...

5249
04:10:26,210 --> 04:10:29,270
Wait, what if I use this and just blast everybody who comes through?

5250
04:10:33,850 --> 04:10:35,330
Oh, it doesn't go up any higher.

5251
04:10:37,750 --> 04:10:38,270
Um...

5252
04:10:39,010 --> 04:10:40,070
Who's coming through?

5253
04:10:40,850 --> 04:10:41,370
Anybody?

5254
04:10:42,170 --> 04:10:42,690
Anybody.

5255
04:10:49,070 --> 04:10:50,570
It's like, so quiet.

5256
04:10:53,210 --> 04:10:53,770
Hmm...

5257
04:10:53,770 --> 04:10:55,270
It's a really nice night though.

5258
04:10:55,890 --> 04:10:56,110
Heh heh.

5259
04:10:58,050 --> 04:10:58,610
Uh...

5260
04:10:58,610 --> 04:10:59,850
They're very patient.

5261
04:11:00,590 --> 04:11:01,690
So am I.

5262
04:11:01,930 --> 04:11:03,110
I could wait here forever.

5263
04:11:07,750 --> 04:11:09,250
I think we gotta go in.

5264
04:11:14,190 --> 04:11:15,430
Oh, I hate the sound.

5265
04:11:17,890 --> 04:11:18,170
Oh!

5266
04:11:18,670 --> 04:11:20,170
That's a lot of explosives.

5267
04:11:20,170 --> 04:11:20,610
I'm...

5268
04:11:20,610 --> 04:11:22,610
They get this...

5269
04:11:27,460 --> 04:11:29,140
That's my buddy's handprint.

5270
04:11:34,390 --> 04:11:35,530
Oh, buddy.

5271
04:11:36,570 --> 04:11:38,070
Oh, buddy.

5272
04:11:38,930 --> 04:11:39,590
Oh, sorry.

5273
04:11:41,290 --> 04:11:43,570
That's my buddy's handprint right there.

5274
04:11:46,450 --> 04:11:47,150
Oh, okay.

5275
04:11:47,830 --> 04:11:48,330
Interesting.

5276
04:11:49,110 --> 04:11:50,450
Maybe if I...

5277
04:11:51,530 --> 04:11:52,010
Okay.

5278
04:11:52,210 --> 04:11:52,850
They don't explode.

5279
04:11:53,350 --> 04:11:54,570
Don't explode that.

5280
04:11:54,570 --> 04:11:55,090
Why not?

5281
04:12:01,750 --> 04:12:02,790
Oh...

5282
04:12:04,630 --> 04:12:05,670
Oh...

5283
04:12:05,670 --> 04:12:06,570
Oh...

5284
04:12:08,330 --> 04:12:09,990
Can I...

5285
04:12:12,230 --> 04:12:13,270
Wait...

5286
04:12:13,270 --> 04:12:14,170
Could I...

5287
04:12:17,150 --> 04:12:19,610
Maybe I can jump over them.

5288
04:12:21,190 --> 04:12:21,970
Oh my gosh.

5289
04:12:22,130 --> 04:12:22,250
Wait.

5290
04:12:22,390 --> 04:12:22,870
No, I can't.

5291
04:12:23,090 --> 04:12:23,190
Oh.

5292
04:12:23,750 --> 04:12:23,890
No!

5293
04:12:24,310 --> 04:12:24,890
I can't.

5294
04:12:24,950 --> 04:12:25,590
I'm too thick.

5295
04:12:26,770 --> 04:12:28,270
I'm too thick to get...

5296
04:12:29,470 --> 04:12:31,130
Just Mission Impossible it.

5297
04:12:31,130 --> 04:13:21,970
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do I can't... I can't... figure out... Oh wait,

5298
04:13:22,130 --> 04:13:22,950
I can grab them.

5299
04:13:23,030 --> 04:13:23,710
I'm so stupid.

5300
04:13:24,350 --> 04:13:26,850
I forgot that... that's a thing I can do.

5301
04:13:28,730 --> 04:13:31,450
Okay, if I like... Alright, let's see.

5302
04:13:34,930 --> 04:13:35,450
Um...

5303
04:13:41,790 --> 04:13:42,730
Don't touch it.

5304
04:13:49,780 --> 04:13:50,540
Don't move.

5305
04:13:51,020 --> 04:13:51,380
Nope.

5306
04:13:53,960 --> 04:13:54,940
Oh my god.

5307
04:13:55,080 --> 04:13:56,060
Please stop moving!

5308
04:13:56,320 --> 04:13:57,480
It's so frustrating.

5309
04:13:58,120 --> 04:13:58,240
Okay.

5310
04:14:00,210 --> 04:14:00,580
Okay.

5311
04:14:06,140 --> 04:14:06,700
Okay.

5312
04:14:07,700 --> 04:14:08,960
And I...

5313
04:14:08,960 --> 04:14:12,140
Actually, like, get up on here and then crouch and...

5314
04:14:12,140 --> 04:14:12,540
Walk.

5315
04:14:14,820 --> 04:14:16,580
Aw yeah, baby.

5316
04:14:18,480 --> 04:14:20,560
She's trying to sneak around, but she's...

5317
04:14:20,560 --> 04:14:22,360
Tommy taking the clap of her...

5318
04:14:22,360 --> 04:14:24,640
ATV keeps alerting the guards.

5319
04:14:24,640 --> 04:14:25,880
Yay!

5320
04:14:26,700 --> 04:14:26,880
Alright.

5321
04:14:27,580 --> 04:14:28,080
Save.

5322
04:14:34,780 --> 04:14:35,680
Knock knock!

5323
04:14:36,800 --> 04:14:38,660
Oh, there we go.

5324
04:14:48,360 --> 04:14:49,060
Grandpa!

5325
04:14:58,570 --> 04:14:59,550
We're fine.

5326
04:15:01,950 --> 04:15:03,770
My thing may be too slow.

5327
04:15:03,870 --> 04:15:04,150
You know what?

5328
04:15:04,350 --> 04:15:04,950
Okay, here, we'll do this.

5329
04:15:05,030 --> 04:15:06,670
Who ordered this operation anyway?

5330
04:15:08,450 --> 04:15:09,050
Yippoo!

5331
04:15:11,690 --> 04:15:13,570
I just saw him run!

5332
04:15:24,070 --> 04:15:25,690
Great throw, thank you!

5333
04:15:29,540 --> 04:15:30,140
Hello?

5334
04:15:30,140 --> 04:15:30,220
No!

5335
04:15:31,580 --> 04:15:32,560
Okay, nevermind.

5336
04:15:39,530 --> 04:15:40,010
Uh...

5337
04:15:40,610 --> 04:15:41,090
Uh...

5338
04:15:41,090 --> 04:15:41,110
Uh...

5339
04:15:41,110 --> 04:15:42,850
Trying to see if there's like a...

5340
04:15:42,850 --> 04:15:44,730
Avoid motion while retinal scan is in progress.

5341
04:15:45,510 --> 04:15:46,990
Beep beep beep beep beep...

5342
04:15:47,510 --> 04:15:48,510
Shooting at props?

5343
04:15:48,650 --> 04:15:48,790
No!

5344
04:15:48,910 --> 04:15:50,290
Sometimes their things are...

5345
04:15:50,290 --> 04:15:51,270
Radios, no?

5346
04:15:51,270 --> 04:15:51,290
No!

5347
04:15:53,850 --> 04:15:55,110
The launch!

5348
04:15:57,950 --> 04:15:59,010
What's this?

5349
04:15:59,710 --> 04:16:00,030
Oh!

5350
04:16:00,910 --> 04:16:01,670
Okay.

5351
04:16:01,970 --> 04:16:02,490
What's...

5352
04:16:02,490 --> 04:16:03,330
What's that mean?

5353
04:16:04,290 --> 04:16:04,990
Let's go...

5354
04:16:04,990 --> 04:16:05,430
Oh my gosh!

5355
04:16:05,590 --> 04:16:06,010
Santa!

5356
04:16:06,410 --> 04:16:07,610
We're gonna blow up Santa!

5357
04:16:18,600 --> 04:16:19,620
Beep beep beep beep beep beep boop!

5358
04:16:20,320 --> 04:16:20,880
You know what?

5359
04:16:21,120 --> 04:16:22,040
I am just gonna save.

5360
04:16:22,260 --> 04:16:22,440
Whatever.

5361
04:16:22,740 --> 04:16:22,820
Oh!

5362
04:16:22,980 --> 04:16:23,860
There's a health thing right here.

5363
04:16:25,480 --> 04:16:26,320
I think I missed.

5364
04:16:26,640 --> 04:16:27,060
Stay down.

5365
04:16:39,190 --> 04:16:41,430
Okay, that might be the guy that I missed.

5366
04:16:43,910 --> 04:16:44,270
Oh!

5367
04:16:44,390 --> 04:16:45,050
Come on, come on!

5368
04:16:48,110 --> 04:16:49,370
Norad tracks Santa!

5369
04:16:50,310 --> 04:16:50,670
Exactly!

5370
04:16:50,670 --> 04:16:50,690
Really?

5371
04:16:52,410 --> 04:16:53,950
Beep beep beep beep boop boop boop!

5372
04:16:54,490 --> 04:16:57,490
Beep beep beep boop boop!

5373
04:16:57,490 --> 04:16:57,850
Oh!

5374
04:16:58,030 --> 04:16:59,470
There's so much science happening in here.

5375
04:16:59,910 --> 04:17:00,910
Or there was!

5376
04:17:01,330 --> 04:17:02,010
Grandpa!

5377
04:17:02,670 --> 04:17:03,430
What's this do?

5378
04:17:04,190 --> 04:17:04,630
Oh!

5379
04:17:07,550 --> 04:17:09,190
I broke it, actually.

5380
04:17:12,250 --> 04:17:14,930
I think going in here is...

5381
04:17:14,930 --> 04:17:16,330
would make me go insane.

5382
04:17:17,610 --> 04:17:17,870
Whoa!

5383
04:17:18,350 --> 04:17:18,830
Cells!

5384
04:17:19,270 --> 04:17:19,870
Wikipedia!

5385
04:17:20,670 --> 04:17:21,250
Whoa!

5386
04:17:25,330 --> 04:17:27,350
I guess we're just gonna launch it then.

5387
04:17:27,650 --> 04:17:28,010
Hold on.

5388
04:17:28,830 --> 04:17:29,610
Just a...

5389
04:17:31,470 --> 04:17:32,230
See?

5390
04:17:32,570 --> 04:17:34,010
I'm blowing up their...

5391
04:17:34,590 --> 04:17:35,350
radio!

5392
04:17:36,310 --> 04:17:37,250
What about this?

5393
04:17:39,030 --> 04:17:40,210
Okay, I give up.

5394
04:17:41,330 --> 04:17:41,710
Alright.

5395
04:17:45,230 --> 04:17:45,990
Launch!

5396
04:17:48,650 --> 04:17:49,430
Can I see?

5397
04:17:51,390 --> 04:17:51,930
Whoa!

5398
04:17:54,870 --> 04:17:55,270
Whoa!

5399
04:17:59,470 --> 04:18:00,010
Whoa!

5400
04:18:00,010 --> 04:18:00,290
Whoa!

5401
04:18:01,770 --> 04:18:02,590
Oh my god!

5402
04:18:02,710 --> 04:18:03,850
There goes Katy Perry!

5403
04:18:03,850 --> 04:18:03,990
Hey!

5404
04:18:04,550 --> 04:18:07,390
You're open up!

5405
04:18:07,470 --> 04:18:07,910
You're open up!

5406
04:18:08,030 --> 04:18:10,710
But one different dimension!

5407
04:18:11,450 --> 04:18:13,050
I'm going blind!

5408
04:18:13,870 --> 04:18:17,310
She's being blasted into space!

5409
04:18:18,630 --> 04:18:20,170
Bye Katy Perry!

5410
04:18:24,940 --> 04:18:26,300
Yay!

5411
04:18:38,340 --> 04:18:40,400
This is sick music playing.

5412
04:18:42,660 --> 04:18:44,540
Who turned up the tunes?

5413
04:18:59,500 --> 04:19:00,560
What do I do?

5414
04:19:08,000 --> 04:19:09,100
One more time!

5415
04:19:09,840 --> 04:19:10,580
Just jump?

5416
04:19:10,900 --> 04:19:11,440
Jump where?

5417
04:19:12,760 --> 04:19:13,980
Go into the hole?

5418
04:19:13,980 --> 04:19:14,880
Okay.

5419
04:19:15,700 --> 04:19:16,170
Okay.

5420
04:19:17,400 --> 04:19:18,260
I'm scared here.

5421
04:19:18,680 --> 04:19:19,800
I'm scared here!

5422
04:19:20,600 --> 04:19:21,540
Oh!

5423
04:19:26,040 --> 04:19:27,240
There we go.

5424
04:19:27,680 --> 04:19:28,180
Alright.

5425
04:19:28,840 --> 04:19:30,320
I'm a professional.

5426
04:19:30,320 --> 04:19:30,420
There we go.

5427
04:19:40,550 --> 04:19:41,810
Congrats on...

5428
04:19:42,070 --> 04:19:42,770
Launching a rocket...

5429
04:19:43,050 --> 04:19:43,870
For no reason!

5430
04:19:44,290 --> 04:19:45,110
Thanks!

5431
04:19:57,200 --> 04:19:58,220
Go back further.

5432
04:19:58,440 --> 04:19:58,760
Oh, okay.

5433
04:20:05,640 --> 04:20:06,480
Oh!

5434
04:20:07,680 --> 04:20:08,100
Oh.

5435
04:20:09,000 --> 04:20:09,840
Thank you.

5436
04:20:16,320 --> 04:20:19,060
I might actually call it here.

5437
04:20:22,020 --> 04:20:22,440
Depending.

5438
04:20:23,080 --> 04:20:23,600
Oh!

5439
04:20:23,960 --> 04:20:24,200
Oh!

5440
04:20:29,060 --> 04:20:30,840
I'm starting to get a little slippery.

5441
04:20:35,350 --> 04:20:36,130
Oh yeah!

5442
04:20:36,450 --> 04:20:37,070
Oh yeah!

5443
04:20:37,230 --> 04:20:37,610
Oh yeah!

5444
04:20:37,690 --> 04:20:38,710
They're giving us all the goods!

5445
04:20:39,770 --> 04:20:40,210
Oh yeah!

5446
04:20:40,410 --> 04:20:40,670
Oh yeah!

5447
04:20:42,650 --> 04:20:43,450
Oh yeah!

5448
04:20:43,690 --> 04:20:43,870
Oh yeah!

5449
04:20:44,290 --> 04:20:44,890
What's that?

5450
04:20:46,590 --> 04:20:47,390
What is...

5451
04:20:47,390 --> 04:20:47,570
Oh!

5452
04:20:47,650 --> 04:20:48,650
Those are more C4s, no?

5453
04:20:49,310 --> 04:20:50,330
Can't carry anymore.

5454
04:20:53,750 --> 04:20:54,950
Drive the train first.

5455
04:20:55,130 --> 04:20:55,530
This one's quick.

5456
04:20:55,690 --> 04:20:55,810
Lucky!

5457
04:20:59,800 --> 04:21:00,440
Let's go!

5458
04:21:03,160 --> 04:21:03,720
Oh.

5459
04:21:04,060 --> 04:21:04,600
Oh!

5460
04:21:05,200 --> 04:21:06,460
I forgot to press...

5461
04:21:06,460 --> 04:21:06,740
Wow!

5462
04:21:06,880 --> 04:21:08,160
We upgraded our ride!

5463
04:21:10,660 --> 04:21:11,220
Apprehension?

5464
04:21:12,380 --> 04:21:13,600
Wait, no it's not!

5465
04:21:13,880 --> 04:21:14,360
Floor it?

5466
04:21:31,680 --> 04:21:32,120
What?

5467
04:21:32,120 --> 04:21:34,120
What if I floor it even harder this time?

5468
04:21:44,730 --> 04:21:45,790
I don't think that works.

5469
04:21:46,330 --> 04:21:47,790
You may need to get off the ride!

5470
04:21:48,150 --> 04:21:50,210
That's not how it works at Disney World!

5471
04:21:55,030 --> 04:22:00,010
I would like to not be on a little thing though.

5472
04:22:03,650 --> 04:22:04,250
Um...

5473
04:22:04,250 --> 04:22:04,530
Wait.

5474
04:22:04,870 --> 04:22:05,050
Please.

5475
04:22:05,270 --> 04:22:05,490
Please.

5476
04:22:13,450 --> 04:22:14,050
Please!

5477
04:22:14,450 --> 04:22:14,590
Ah!

5478
04:22:14,710 --> 04:22:15,130
Reloading!

5479
04:22:36,180 --> 04:22:37,980
Maybe this is a good...

5480
04:22:37,980 --> 04:22:38,080
Spot.

5481
04:22:38,660 --> 04:22:41,700
I would like to get off Mr. Freepin's Wild Ride.

5482
04:22:42,340 --> 04:22:42,660
Ah!

5483
04:22:48,960 --> 04:22:50,620
Good place to end, maybe.

5484
04:22:54,940 --> 04:22:57,080
Good place to end here, maybe.

5485
04:22:58,200 --> 04:22:58,660
We...

5486
04:22:58,660 --> 04:22:59,620
We, uh...

5487
04:22:59,620 --> 04:23:00,620
We should save.

5488
04:23:02,220 --> 04:23:03,440
Let's see what's down here.

5489
04:23:03,940 --> 04:23:04,540
I am having...

5490
04:23:04,540 --> 04:23:06,480
Oh, there's like...

5491
04:23:08,200 --> 04:23:08,660
Oh.

5492
04:23:10,820 --> 04:23:11,600
Oh, damn.

5493
04:23:11,940 --> 04:23:12,620
No way.

5494
04:23:18,240 --> 04:23:18,900
Oh, please!

5495
04:23:20,740 --> 04:23:22,940
The one spot I could get stuck on, I did.

5496
04:23:24,480 --> 04:23:25,250
Wait, there was another...

5497
04:23:25,830 --> 04:23:26,310
Mati!

5498
04:23:26,570 --> 04:23:26,690
Mati!

5499
04:23:26,690 --> 04:23:27,350
Thank you so much!

5500
04:23:27,570 --> 04:23:29,350
Oh my goodness, there's so much in here!

5501
04:23:29,710 --> 04:23:31,650
Thank you so much for the time you have to thank you!

5502
04:23:34,070 --> 04:23:34,550
Uh...

5503
04:23:36,570 --> 04:23:37,970
Oh, now we're down here.

5504
04:23:41,150 --> 04:23:41,630
Okay.

5505
04:23:42,190 --> 04:23:44,050
We've managed to avoid drowning.

5506
04:23:48,590 --> 04:23:49,550
Are there...

5507
04:23:50,550 --> 04:23:52,050
Oh, I'm taking the stairs.

5508
04:23:52,230 --> 04:23:52,850
Like, I'm...

5509
04:23:52,850 --> 04:23:53,530
Not...

5510
04:23:53,530 --> 04:23:54,610
Able to...

5511
04:23:54,610 --> 04:23:54,890
Swim.

5512
04:23:55,890 --> 04:23:56,450
Where...

5513
04:23:56,450 --> 04:23:57,530
And go wherever I please.

5514
04:24:01,110 --> 04:24:01,670
Ah!

5515
04:24:08,080 --> 04:24:09,520
Don't even know where I am!

5516
04:24:09,760 --> 04:24:10,640
I'm lost!

5517
04:24:10,760 --> 04:24:11,600
What the hell is that?

5518
04:24:16,860 --> 04:24:17,420
Ew.

5519
04:24:20,220 --> 04:24:21,380
Not the gurgle.

5520
04:24:29,810 --> 04:24:31,630
This is just a big ol' rock!

5521
04:24:34,970 --> 04:24:35,730
Um...

5522
04:24:35,730 --> 04:24:36,050
Yeah!

5523
04:24:37,210 --> 04:24:37,970
Yes!

5524
04:24:38,970 --> 04:24:39,730
Yes!

5525
04:24:41,170 --> 04:24:41,930
Uh...

5526
04:24:41,930 --> 04:24:41,950
Yeah!

5527
04:24:44,610 --> 04:24:45,370
Uh...

5528
04:24:45,370 --> 04:24:45,510
Oh!

5529
04:24:46,670 --> 04:24:47,310
Finally!

5530
04:24:47,650 --> 04:24:48,290
Thank you!

5531
04:24:49,450 --> 04:24:50,370
The game said...

5532
04:24:50,930 --> 04:24:52,310
Hey girl, you need some help?

5533
04:24:52,810 --> 04:24:53,830
We got you, girl.

5534
04:24:53,970 --> 04:24:54,430
We got you.

5535
04:24:56,830 --> 04:24:57,310
Oi!

5536
04:24:59,530 --> 04:25:00,010
Oi!

5537
04:25:04,810 --> 04:25:07,530
I love watching the aliens just do their thing.

5538
04:25:08,110 --> 04:25:11,250
He's picking them like he's picking bugs from a monkey.

5539
04:25:14,570 --> 04:25:15,370
Hey!

5540
04:25:15,370 --> 04:25:15,530
Dang!

5541
04:25:16,890 --> 04:25:17,770
You'll take...

5542
04:25:17,770 --> 04:25:20,490
You'll really eat them bullets sometimes.

5543
04:25:22,110 --> 04:25:23,350
Ooh, the flashing lights.

5544
04:25:25,030 --> 04:25:25,470
Oh!

5545
04:25:28,520 --> 04:25:29,320
Yeah!

5546
04:25:29,500 --> 04:25:30,960
Keep taking those guys down!

5547
04:25:31,500 --> 04:25:32,880
Do my job for me!

5548
04:25:34,240 --> 04:25:35,460
He's doing a mukbang?

5549
04:25:37,440 --> 04:25:38,160
Wait.

5550
04:25:38,500 --> 04:25:39,740
I hope I didn't just...

5551
04:25:40,220 --> 04:25:41,500
Accidentally deplete that...

5552
04:25:41,500 --> 04:25:42,280
With no reason.

5553
04:25:47,100 --> 04:25:47,820
Uh...

5554
04:25:48,460 --> 04:25:48,900
Okay.

5555
04:25:51,840 --> 04:25:52,560
Okay.

5556
04:25:53,420 --> 04:25:53,840
Alright.

5557
04:25:54,340 --> 04:25:55,700
I feel we're like...

5558
04:25:55,700 --> 04:25:58,080
Slightly in the middle of the...

5559
04:25:59,780 --> 04:26:00,920
Of the...

5560
04:26:00,920 --> 04:26:02,020
The level now.

5561
04:26:02,340 --> 04:26:04,300
Actually, I don't know what to do here.

5562
04:26:16,630 --> 04:26:17,710
Back in the water.

5563
04:26:20,570 --> 04:26:22,510
I have zero memories of this part.

5564
04:26:22,670 --> 04:26:23,770
You repressed it, probably.

5565
04:26:26,550 --> 04:26:27,430
Right side.

5566
04:26:29,470 --> 04:26:30,010
Oh!

5567
04:26:30,370 --> 04:26:31,290
I see!

5568
04:26:31,310 --> 04:26:32,570
We were on that side.

5569
04:26:32,710 --> 04:26:32,990
Oh!

5570
04:26:33,250 --> 04:26:33,410
Okay.

5571
04:26:33,670 --> 04:26:33,830
Alright.

5572
04:26:34,810 --> 04:26:35,930
I'm going to...

5573
04:26:35,930 --> 04:26:36,310
I'm...

5574
04:26:36,310 --> 04:26:37,330
I'm stopping myself.

5575
04:26:37,550 --> 04:26:38,530
I'm stopping myself.

5576
04:26:38,910 --> 04:26:40,230
This was so much fun though!

5577
04:26:40,370 --> 04:26:41,310
Thank you guys for...

5578
04:26:41,310 --> 04:26:42,290
More...

5579
04:26:42,290 --> 04:26:43,190
For more...

5580
04:26:43,190 --> 04:26:44,330
Half-Life.

5581
04:26:45,150 --> 04:26:45,590
Um...

5582
04:26:46,870 --> 04:26:49,330
I'm making sure that I look at the right side.

5583
04:26:49,330 --> 04:26:50,610
So that when I start the...

5584
04:26:50,610 --> 04:26:50,910
Uh...

5585
04:26:50,910 --> 04:26:51,510
Start next time.

5586
04:26:51,570 --> 04:26:52,170
I can be like...

5587
04:26:52,170 --> 04:26:53,470
The right side.

5588
04:26:53,630 --> 04:26:54,530
Is where I need to go.

5589
04:26:55,050 --> 04:26:55,490
So...

5590
04:26:55,490 --> 04:26:55,650
Yeah!

5591
04:26:56,010 --> 04:26:56,790
Thank you guys!

5592
04:26:57,150 --> 04:26:58,770
Thank you for your help too.

5593
04:26:58,810 --> 04:26:59,810
Helping guide me.

5594
04:26:59,930 --> 04:27:01,130
And all that fun stuff.

5595
04:27:02,370 --> 04:27:02,810
Um...

5596
04:27:02,810 --> 04:27:04,190
This has been a lot of fun.

5597
04:27:05,070 --> 04:27:05,510
And...

5598
04:27:05,510 --> 04:27:05,950
Yeah!

5599
04:27:07,710 --> 04:27:08,150
Um...

5600
04:27:08,150 --> 04:27:08,870
They did great tonight.

5601
04:27:08,870 --> 04:27:09,790
I can assure you...

5602
04:27:09,790 --> 04:27:10,490
The Marines...

5603
04:27:10,490 --> 04:27:11,930
Give everybody a hard time...

5604
04:27:11,930 --> 04:27:12,730
On their first playthrough.

5605
04:27:13,810 --> 04:27:14,210
We're...

5606
04:27:14,210 --> 04:27:14,930
We're making it work.

5607
04:27:15,530 --> 04:27:16,650
Thanks for the super fun stream.

5608
04:27:16,830 --> 04:27:17,370
Thank you!

5609
04:27:17,790 --> 04:27:18,070
Thank you!

5610
04:27:18,210 --> 04:27:18,650
Thank you!

5611
04:27:18,990 --> 04:27:19,650
Thank you!

5612
04:27:19,790 --> 04:27:20,310
Thank you!

5613
04:27:20,730 --> 04:27:21,210
Yeah!

5614
04:27:21,530 --> 04:27:22,270
Have a good rest of your night.

5615
04:27:22,430 --> 04:27:22,810
You too!

5616
04:27:23,670 --> 04:27:23,870
Uh...

5617
04:27:23,870 --> 04:27:24,410
Otsumito!

5618
04:27:24,650 --> 04:27:24,990
Everybody!

5619
04:27:25,650 --> 04:27:26,030
And...

5620
04:27:26,030 --> 04:27:27,610
I will see you when I see you...

5621
04:27:27,610 --> 04:27:28,330
Next time!

5622
04:27:28,910 --> 04:27:29,110
Oh!

5623
04:27:30,550 --> 04:27:31,030
Tomorrow...

5624
04:27:32,410 --> 04:27:34,030
Pretty hot dog stream.

5625
04:27:35,250 --> 04:27:35,630
Thanks.

5626
04:27:35,630 --> 04:27:36,930
What was I gonna say?

5627
04:27:39,250 --> 04:27:42,050
I didn't kill any Barneys this time!

5628
04:27:42,470 --> 04:27:43,070
Woohoo!

5629
04:27:44,530 --> 04:27:46,330
That's one thing I was gonna say.

5630
04:27:47,610 --> 04:27:48,210
And...

5631
04:27:49,470 --> 04:27:50,070
Uh...

5632
04:27:50,070 --> 04:27:50,510
Well...

5633
04:27:50,510 --> 04:27:52,250
Hailey to Waspin got arrested!

5634
04:27:56,390 --> 04:27:57,430
Are you sure?

5635
04:27:57,910 --> 04:27:59,210
What do you mean am I sure?

5636
04:28:02,730 --> 04:28:03,330
Arigato!

5637
04:28:03,530 --> 04:28:03,830
Arigato!

5638
04:28:04,070 --> 04:28:04,510
Choo!

5639
04:28:04,510 --> 04:28:05,150
Uh...

5640
04:28:05,150 --> 04:28:06,390
I think I didn't kill him.

5641
04:28:06,610 --> 04:28:06,770
Yeah!

5642
04:28:10,310 --> 04:28:10,830
Uh...

5643
04:28:10,830 --> 04:28:11,390
But...

5644
04:28:11,390 --> 04:28:12,050
Um...

5645
04:28:12,050 --> 04:28:12,310
Tomorrow...

5646
04:28:12,310 --> 04:28:12,910
Is...

5647
04:28:12,910 --> 04:28:13,870
Is Thursday, right?

5648
04:28:14,010 --> 04:28:14,890
So I have two streams.

5649
04:28:15,510 --> 04:28:15,770
Um...

5650
04:28:15,770 --> 04:28:17,110
One will be a midday stream.

5651
04:28:18,370 --> 04:28:19,410
And then...

5652
04:28:19,410 --> 04:28:20,070
Um...

5653
04:28:20,070 --> 04:28:21,870
I will also be on Doki Bird's channel.

5654
04:28:22,510 --> 04:28:23,030
Uh...

5655
04:28:23,030 --> 04:28:23,830
That night...

5656
04:28:23,830 --> 04:28:27,170
I will just be hanging out while she plays Visage.

5657
04:28:27,390 --> 04:28:29,410
And I will be telling her...

5658
04:28:29,410 --> 04:28:30,210
To...

5659
04:28:30,210 --> 04:28:30,670
Do stuff!

5660
04:28:31,410 --> 04:28:31,930
Yeah!

5661
04:28:33,050 --> 04:28:34,830
You did kill one or two.

5662
04:28:35,110 --> 04:28:35,590
No!

5663
04:28:36,350 --> 04:28:36,790
Oh...

5664
04:28:36,790 --> 04:28:37,050
I did?

5665
04:28:37,670 --> 04:28:39,690
She didn't directly kill any Barneys.

5666
04:28:39,950 --> 04:28:42,090
I wouldn't directly kill Barney!

5667
04:28:47,980 --> 04:28:48,540
Electricity!

5668
04:28:50,480 --> 04:28:51,620
I took a hit.

5669
04:28:51,880 --> 04:28:53,220
But I could take more.

5670
04:28:53,480 --> 04:28:55,000
And then he took another step.

5671
04:28:55,000 --> 04:28:55,520
And he's like...

5672
04:28:55,520 --> 04:28:57,480
I don't know if I could take any more of this.

5673
04:29:02,270 --> 04:29:04,050
That did accidentally happen.

5674
04:29:04,510 --> 04:29:05,290
Tentacle Barney.

5675
04:29:05,370 --> 04:29:06,430
I don't remember that guy.

5676
04:29:06,690 --> 04:29:08,410
He must have not been very important.

5677
04:29:08,870 --> 04:29:11,030
You're the MVP of the Visage...

5678
04:29:11,590 --> 04:29:12,070
Visage...

5679
04:29:12,070 --> 04:29:12,770
Visage...

5680
04:29:12,770 --> 04:29:13,150
Streams.

5681
04:29:13,610 --> 04:29:15,350
We'd be there forever otherwise.

5682
04:29:16,490 --> 04:29:17,070
But yeah!

5683
04:29:17,450 --> 04:29:17,810
Otsumito!

5684
04:29:18,110 --> 04:29:18,170
Everybody!

5685
04:29:18,570 --> 04:29:19,230
Thank you so much!

5686
04:29:19,410 --> 04:29:20,430
I will see you guys...

5687
04:29:20,430 --> 04:29:21,450
When I see you next...

5688
04:29:21,450 --> 04:29:22,230
Thank you!

5689
04:29:22,490 --> 04:29:23,810
We're sticking around till the very end.

5690
04:29:23,930 --> 04:29:25,070
And I will see you...

5691
04:29:25,630 --> 04:29:26,430
Next time!

5692
04:29:27,050 --> 04:29:27,470
Otsumito!

5693
04:29:27,850 --> 04:29:28,670
Itte rashai!

5694
04:29:28,850 --> 04:29:29,290
Bye-bye!

5695
04:29:29,630 --> 04:29:29,930
Bye-bye!

5696
04:29:30,070 --> 04:29:30,370
Bye-bye!

5697
04:29:30,370 --> 04:29:31,050
Bye-bye!
