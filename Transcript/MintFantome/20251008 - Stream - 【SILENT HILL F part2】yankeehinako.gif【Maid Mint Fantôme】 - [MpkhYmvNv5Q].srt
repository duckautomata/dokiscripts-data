1
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,700
Hold on, my setup is all weird.

2
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,580
Hold on.

3
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,860
One second.

4
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,340
Ah, one second.

5
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,580
Why is this so weird?

6
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,560
What's so...

7
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,780
Ah!

8
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,460
Oh, everybody, welcome.

9
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,540
Let me grab my controller too.

10
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,980
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

11
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,720
Everything is changed.

12
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,740
All the things are different.

13
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,800
Everything is different.

14
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,600
Star Creator!

15
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,320
Happy birthday!

16
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,980
Happy birthday, happy birthday!

17
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,060
Happy birthday to you!

18
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,700
Happy birthday to you!

19
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,660
Happy birthday dear Star Creator!

20
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,360
Happy birthday to you!

21
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,200
Happy birthday!

22
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,780
For my stream deck, I just...

23
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,700
I just updated my stream deck.

24
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,280
There was like a one update that I remember I really didn't want.

25
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,840
I don't remember what it was.

26
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,480
So I never updated it.

27
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,340
No, I just did it.

28
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,800
So I was like, I don't know what else to do.

29
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,940
Oh, hi-ya!

30
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,480
Oh, hi-ya, oh, hi-ya.

31
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
But it fixed it.

32
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,220
I can use my stream deck again.

33
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,540
Ghost in the game are so cool and scary and pretty.

34
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,660
I might be into ghost.

35
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,320
The work on the Iron Mouse collab.

36
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,060
Oh, it wasn't a collab with Iron Mouse.

37
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,840
It was actually like a, what do you say?

38
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,860
A surprise for her, but I'm glad you liked it.

39
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,040
Thank you.

40
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,160
What was that?

41
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,720
Mm-hmm.

42
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,220
So!

43
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,780
So!

44
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
We're back.

45
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,540
Silent Hill.

46
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,040
Spooky, spooky.

47
00:06:47,580 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm like in the mood for a spooky game today, not so i'm like i want to watch people play spooky games but i don't want to play against spooky game myself here i am playing a spooky game myself congrats to the wisps who watched the christmas karaoke i'm passing that your due date do any of kids mince kids share her birthday no

48
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,000
There's no children.

49
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,260
There are none.

50
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,140
Hand me the controller.

51
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:37,120
Yeah, it's one of those days where you're like, well, I never had like an older brother, but you want like your older sibling to like play a game and you watch the game.

52
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
That's how I'm feeling today.

53
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,680
I don't want to be the streamer.

54
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,080
I want to watch the streamer.

55
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
I want to watch the streamer.

56
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,200
Silent Hill F for me.

57
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,020
Silent Hill F more like Silent Hill Sword Trick Royale.

58
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,060
No!

59
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,120
But you are streamer, I am streamer.

60
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,380
Today though, I don't know, maybe because I was watching other streamers.

61
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,440
And I was just like, ah, this is what it's like to be, you know, just chilling and watching the streamer.

62
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
You know what I mean?

63
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,500
Look, give me the controller.

64
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,880
Okay, I give me the controller.

65
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,880
You control, you control them.

66
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,760
I watch.

67
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,940
Nah, we'll play.

68
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,660
Okay, good.

69
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,320
My controller is working, though.

70
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,060
Wait, what's wrong?

71
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,900
What happened to my Omamori?

72
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,020
What?

73
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,560
Omamori, where?

74
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,020
Try downloading it.

75
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,460
Wait, what?

76
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,860
What happened?

77
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,480
They patched it.

78
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,120
I like how it said the white Seifuku, but I still have the rabbit.

79
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,020
Oh, wait, isn't it Steam update right now?

80
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,380
It's Tuesday.

81
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,680
Or wait, no, isn't that at 6 p.m.

82
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,360
ESC?

83
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:23,790
What?

84
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,430
It didn't say anything about the rabbit uniform.

85
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,710
That's so strange.

86
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,050
I have a lot of issues with Steam.

87
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,830
Sometimes with, like...

88
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,530
This shouldn't matter here, but, like, the cloud not sinking.

89
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,430
I have quite a bit of issues with that.

90
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,420
Oh, well, we're not...

91
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,880
It kind of sucks, though.

92
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,760
I don't think I was using those Omamori, though.

93
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,120
So, the, or the Pianni one.

94
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,360
I think.

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,600
And I wasn't using the white Seifuq.

96
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,480
Hmm.

97
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,860
Let's see what's going on here.

98
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,390
Oh, yeah, see, we're fine.

99
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:12,910
We're fine.

100
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,150
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

101
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,090
Well, we're not okay, because we're in Silent Hill, but...

102
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,270
We're mostly okay.

103
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,570
Okay, I gotta remember how to do stuff.

104
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,330
Okay, there is durability on these.

105
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,070
Oh my gosh, I gotta get more weapons.

106
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,370
Or I just leave, you know, whatever.

107
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,030
That's Dodge.

108
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,250
And then, like, right...

109
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:39,470
No, that's...

110
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,770
That's like the lock-on.

111
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,130
This is the attack.

112
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,210
Big attack.

113
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,010
Dang, girl.

114
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,230
And this is quick.

115
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,610
Left trigger is your focus.

116
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

118
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,410
The strongest pipe in gaming history?

119
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,110
You think so?

120
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,530
I don't know.

121
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,910
I think a stronger pipe would...

122
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,770
I think I've seen pipes that last the whole game before.

123
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,240
I thought I heard footsteps.

124
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,420
So scary.

125
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,340
I have to go over this way.

126
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,340
So let me see real quick.

127
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,320
I guess maybe a journal?

128
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,880
No.

129
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,160
I'm trying to see where it says our goals.

130
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,720
Our goals, our goals, our goals.

131
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,720
You were following Shu, right?

132
00:11:44,320 --> 00:12:11,860
loser went ahead of us so he was just like oh catch up you know i'll i'll you gotta follow me and then he just ditches us he's kind of the worst he's kind of awful but it was we tried exploring this way there was some scariness going on in there so i'm just gonna go this way

133
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:51,120
right I'm scared of this way though look we got like the the scarecrows there was like stuff about sneaking up maybe one day I'll get it and I saw something also walk that way walk that way it did though it did no time for jokes I'm scared what are you looking at what's your name Hinako Guys,

134
00:12:51,360 --> 00:13:04,860
I think Oh, here's my map Okay, yeah, we gotta go that way, I believe Because that's the way Shu went And then he's smart And knows how to, like, walk around cars We don't know how to do that Where can I watch your Iron Mouse collab?

135
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:30,300
I don't I think there's a miscommunication I don't have a collab with Iron Mouse But I was invited to a fan uh how do you say a fan project of her song where we sung the song can i not go

136
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,700
what's down this way though well we've gone that way let's just keep going let's just keep going to the new area

137
00:13:45,070 --> 00:14:07,390
i don't like that why Oh there she is I knew I told you I told you there was somebody over there Oh my god so scary Oh my god as soon as I step up Stop it right now

138
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:21,110
Stop it right now What a creepy scarecrow It's wearing our uniform Guys I think I had like Okay Don't...

139
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,030
If I get this right, if you know, spoilers for the game.

140
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,350
I think I had, like, a big brain moment.

141
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,570
So I saw a screenshot of one of the bosses.

142
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,410
And she had twin tails, just like Sakuko.

143
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,930
And I was like...

144
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,310
Uh-oh.

145
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,830
Uh-oh.

146
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:41,810
Uh-oh.

147
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,450
But don't...

148
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,210
Don't confirm nor deny.

149
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,450
Don't say anything.

150
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,770
And I was like, oh no.

151
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,350
Because Sakuko died, though.

152
00:14:50,410 --> 00:15:03,110
I'm scared how do I run being a quirky girl oh my god don't see me

153
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:21,400
left stick okay are three nice one that

154
00:15:29,000 --> 00:16:07,420

155
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,680
But, look, we still have the pink rabbit costume, so why don't I have the white Seifuku?

156
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,910
On the road again.

157
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,170
I can't wait to be on the road again.

158
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,270
So maybe I need to go down.

159
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,810
Probably.

160
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,850
Maybe Sugaoka.

161
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,350
Yeah, Shu, what the hell?

162
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,110
Oh, he is here.

163
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,270
Wait, how, where have you been?

164
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,390
Yeah, this is...

165
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,050
...I'm always going to do something like this.

166
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,850
...I'm not sure what's your...

167
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,810
...you know, it's not like that.

168
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,510
Then...

169
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,210
...together with each other.

170
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:02,870
Yeah!

171
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,970
Oh.

172
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,970
...I'm just going to do it yourself.

173
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,450
She thinks you smell.

174
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,160
These guys really plump cheeks, huh?

175
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,900
Our journal has been...

176
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,040
Space Wars!

177
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,480
This is a game that Shu and I played together when we were kids.

178
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,700
Basically, aliens known as the Galactic Imperium would arrive in UFOs and droids.

179
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,460
And we would fight them to protect the town.

180
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,860
Wait, this is so cute.

181
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,460
The art is so cute.

182
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,500
Playmates would come and go.

183
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,020
We called them new recruits and fallen ones, respectively.

184
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,180
And in the end, Shu and I were the only ones left standing to combat the Galactic Imperium.

185
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,980
I see.

186
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,280
Why isn't Shu with us?

187
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,020
This guy sucks.

188
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,540
Oh, let's get some meds.

189
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,480
Let's look around a bit for some meds as well.

190
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,980
Anything in here?

191
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,020
cute

192
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,930
um I don't want to go too far back because of a lady you know what we're fine

195
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,100
Oh!

196
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,580
Okay.

197
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,340
Oh.

198
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,560
What is...

199
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,760
So some areas are like super ultra red.

200
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,440
Why?

201
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,400
Do you guys think I should go up or around?

202
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,240
Oh my god.

203
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,820
Well...

204
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,780
Let's see, I guess.

205
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,570
Ah!

206
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,610
Oh my god!

207
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,070
Oh my god!

208
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,340
I tried to...

209
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,560
Oh.

210
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,900
Oh my god!

211
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,700
You will not be able to be able to free yourself from an enemy's grasp if they successfully grab you.

212
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,280
When grabbed by an enemy, your health and sanity will drop significantly.

213
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,980
Be sure to stay aware of your surroundings.

214
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,840
If your chosen story, being grabbed by enemies will not cost your current max sanity.

215
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,500
Okay, nice.

216
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,720
Well, thanks a whole lot.

217
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,860
trying to sneak up on you.

218
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,500
Hate!

219
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh!

220
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,090
Oh my god.

221
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,490
Oh.

222
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,340
Oh my god.

223
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,920
Where are you?

224
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,040
Oh.

225
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,460
Oh.

226
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,680
I dodged too soon.

227
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,980
It's fine.

228
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,380
Oh my gosh, please.

229
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,460
Dodge!

230
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,280
Ah!

231
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Die!

232
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,260
Die!

233
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,540
Die monster!

234
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,840
So scary.

235
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,360
They're so creepy.

236
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,740
In like the best way.

237
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,560
Oh no, my weapon!

238
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,680
Uh oh, okay.

239
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,540
I'm glad she tells you though, shoot.

240
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,540
Oh yeah, that's pretty bad.

241
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,320
She does tell you though, that's kind of nice.

242
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,460
Um, those look like sticks.

243
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,680
Saw another playthrough where the character came around from the other side of the house and didn't see it coming.

244
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,280
Too spooky.

245
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,000
Way too spooky.

246
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,240
Why don't everybody...

247
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,780
All houses should have pipes.

248
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,120
Just saying.

249
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,140
Oh.

250
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Are we going...

251
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,060
Oh?

252
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Okay.

253
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,760
Survived my first Sabrina Carpenter concert.

254
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,020
There were so many people I panicked and ran out.

255
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,840
When I came back, A guy fainted?

256
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,580
You went and saw the Sabrina Carpenter?

257
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,000
She's so hot.

258
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,300
Wait, I can just go inside?

259
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,180
Wait, I'm scared.

260
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,340
I don't want to be indoors.

261
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,240
I want to see Sabrina Carpenter.

262
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,680
She's so sexy.

263
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,590
But you did it.

264
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,390
I'm scared!

265
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,690
If I die, I die.

266
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:57,910
Uh-oh.

267
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,290
There's blood in there.

268
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,970
Don't like that.

269
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,350
You know what?

270
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,790
I'm gonna switch to my other weapon just in case this does crack.

271
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,920
I can... I don't like it one bit.

272
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,340
I don't like it one bit.

273
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,340
I don't like it one bit.

274
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,380
I don't like it one bit.

275
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,100
Oh!

276
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
Oh, no, good.

277
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,320
won't budge.

278
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,180
Okay, you know what?

279
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,760
That's fine.

280
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Maybe for the better.

281
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,500
Actually for the best.

282
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,540
Wait, that's someone in the bed.

283
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,610
I don't know, I'm sexy.

284
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,010
Okay, Sensei.

285
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,250
Wait, can I... This thing's gonna... For sure.

286
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,790
Oh.

287
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,630

We'll accept anything!

290
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,750
Anything but gold!

291
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,870
I've learned from Minecraft!

292
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,290
Gold is too soft, breaks too easily.

293
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,110
What was that?

294
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,110
Oh, my camera locked for a second.

295
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,770
I was too scared.

296
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,810
I'm using every...

297
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,470
Like, I'm using my camera to the max ability.

298
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,690
Oh my gosh.

299
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,250
What's this?

300
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,410
Kudzu tea.

301
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,870
Slightly thick.

302
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,670
Drink mid by dissolving kudzu powder in water.

303
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,970
In this region, ginger and freshly... I'm drinking ginger right now.

304
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,070
Ginger and freshly pressed juice are added to enrich the flavor.

305
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,410
Freeze it before drinking.

306
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,770
Slowly restores health and current max sanity.

307
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,190
What's my health at anyway?

308
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
Some stuff over here.

309
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:43,960
Arate.

310
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
It's pleasant crunch makes it never boring to eat.

311
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,820
You cannot hold any more items.

312
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,340
Uh-oh.

313
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,560
Okay, okay, okay.

314
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,220
I will...

315
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,840
I'll drink this then.

316
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,410
What's in here?

317
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,010
Whoa.

318
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,390
Okay.

319
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,370
Open.

320
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,520
I didn't expect that.

321
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,060
Oh.

322
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,860
Okay.

323
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
We'll just close that back up here.

324
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,720
Okay, okay.

325
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,500
Okay.

326
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,300
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,160
Aha!

328
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,000
I got it!

329
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:33,900
Oh, whoops.

330
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:42,600
It's interesting that you have to, like, kind of direct the camera to where you, like, the thing you want to look at, you know what I mean?

331
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,560
She didn't even say anything about it.

332
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,310
You guys, is it...

333
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,670
Are you guys also hearing the creaks, or is it just me?

334
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,330
Wait, I threw away the drink?

335
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,330
I didn't consume it?

336
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:05,790
Oh.

337
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,410
The creaks and the...

338
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,310
Like, the...

339
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,090
Like, sounds like someone's upstairs.

340
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,010
It's a discard.

341
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,630
Oh my god.

342
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,190
No!

343
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,490
I'm so stupid!

344
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,730
Well, I don't think it would have let me do anything.

345
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,430
Oh, yeah, see, there it is.

346
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,450
No!

347
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,990
It wouldn't have let me take it, though, I think.

348
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,250
Oops.

349
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,530

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,560
I'm real spooked.

359
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,480
Don't...

360
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,460
Shit, I knew it.

361
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,540
I was about to say don't wake up.

362
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,160
Oh, my God!

363
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,620
Jump scare is imminent.

364
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,480
I know!

365
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,560
My plushie finally arrived.

366
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm so glad.

367
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,340
Thank you for ordering it.

368
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,440
What if we leave?

369
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
I knew it.

370
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,500
I knew it.

371
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,780
I tried to kill her when I had the chance.

372
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,680
You not go, why didn't you kill her when you had the chance?

373
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
Maybe it's nothing and you're fine.

374
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,200
Yeah.

375
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,020
Check the room.

376
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,450
Look how bright and inviting the outdoors looks.

377
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,820
so spacious so many places to go

378
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:35,690
I thought I would unlock the drawer and she would wake up then did not expect her to be gone now I'm so scared okay wait I'm gonna do something which might be a little silly to you all I'm gonna go save

379
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:50,410
I'm gonna go save I don't want to go through the panic all over again We're safe scumming a little bit At the moment

380
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,050
Who?

381
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,030
Who?

382
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,750
Who is here?

383
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,050
Who is around?

384
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,850
You better get out.

385
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,630
You better go away.

386
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,110
I don't want to deal.

387
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:17,650
okay okay okay we're fine we're fine asterisk

388
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,930

390
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:03,960
I guess it's more of, like, uh, I don't know where it will load me back at, so we'll just, just for safe measure.

391
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,660
You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,800
She's giving so spooky.

393
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,060
Why are we in here anyway?

394
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,700
I didn't really have to come in here, huh?

395
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,980
I mean, I guess I do.

396
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,540
What if it's a really good item?

397
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,720
Maybe it's worth it.

398
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,680
You've died before, you're a ghost.

399
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,780
Okay.

400
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,700
All right.

401
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,600
All right.

402
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,940
Okay.

403
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,220
How do I avoid getting grabbed?

404
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,840
Like this.

405
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,600
Walk and jump.

406
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
Walk and jump back.

407
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,040
Walk and jump back.

408
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,820
Where did she go?

409
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,720
Oh.

410
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,640
Maybe she loved.

411
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,800
Square?

412
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,760
Oh, wait.

413
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:04,900
I'm...

414
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,760
Is that B?

415
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:08,780
No.

416
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:09,880
X?

417
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,100
Ceiling?

418
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:13,940
Oh, true.

419
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm so scared.

420
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,840
Okay, I'll be brave.

421
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,800
I'll be brave.

422
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,640
I'll be brave.

423
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,100
I'll be brave.

424
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,580
I'll be brave.

425
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,060
I'll be brave.

426
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,860
I'll be brave.

427
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,940
X to lock on.

428
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,360
Okay, okay.

429
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,720
Thank you.

430
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,500
I'll be brave, I'll be brave, I'll be brave, I'll be brave, I'll be brave, I'll be brave I'll be brave!

431
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:57,720
Local doctors note Even now the trust given to the longstanding physicians of the IY family is unshakably strong When I spoke to the eldest working member of the family at a gathering I was astonished by their outstanding bounty of knowledge Though as they discussed the details of their practices with me I got the hint

432
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,360
I got the hint that they might still be using controlled substances in their treatment.

433
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,180
However, I think it's best to look the other way in this situation.

434
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,340
Okay.

435
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:24,440
While it is now illegal to produce the cloudy rice wine known as Doburoku, Doburoku, people across Japan were once free to make it as they needed.

436
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,400
Perhaps operating within the gray area of legislation between traditional and modern medicine has always been the role.

437
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,460
Of local physicians here.

438
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,700
If it's wine, how bad is it?

439
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,900
I was going to say moonshine.

440
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,660
Yeah, I was thinking moonshine too.

441
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,560
Okay.

442
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,520
Okay, time to press.

443
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,220
Time to go back and then go back into the game.

444
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,920
And I'm leaving.

445
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm leaving.

446
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,960
I'm leaving.

447
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,480
Leaving me.

448
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,640
Nope.

449
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,800
Nope.

450
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:03,920
No one's there.

451
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,800
No one's there.

452
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,900
Don't do it!

453
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,940
Don't do it!

454
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,940
Don't do it!

455
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,600
Why would you think somebody's there, huh?

456
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,440
Why would you...

457
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,380
But the loot?

458
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,900
I know, you're right.

459
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,150
I don't know why this game scares me so bad, you guys.

460
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,350
Wait, so it opened the door but didn't?

461
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,860
They could have a pipe.

462
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
There could be a pipe in there.

463
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,340
There could be a gun!

464
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,060
There could be a pipe or a gun!

465
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,840
Oh, the game just saved for me.

466
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,700
Okay, awesome.

467
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,040
Oh, oh.

468
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,040
I'm peeping.

469
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm peeping.

470
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,460
I'm peeping.

471
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,300
I'm peeping.

472
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,780
There is a window.

473
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,600
I guess I could maybe jump out of it.

474
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,120
Who knows?

475
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,180
Um, anyway.

476
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,160
I'm too scared to function.

477
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,620
At the moment.

478
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,400
Why would we go inside?

479
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,200
Should not go, please.

480
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,640
Have some common sense.

481
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,120
My friend.

482
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,260
Girl, please.

483
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,740
Why would you go inside this room?

484
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:33,700
Okay.

485
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,520
Seems like a whole lot of nothing.

486
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,180
I don't even see a weapon.

487
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,050
I hear that.

488
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,970
Sorry if the audio is like so low.

489
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,710
It's pretty loud for me, though.

490
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:51,670
Okay.

491
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,330
Here we go.

492
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:54,950
Oh!

493
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,550
I don't like that.

494
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,850
Okay, maybe it left out the window.

495
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,430
Actually.

496
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,150
Oh.

497
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,270
There's like drugs and stuff on the ground.

498
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,030
Claw marks.

499
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:16,970
What do we have?

500
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,790
Oh, another Omemori.

501
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,530
Increases Max health.

502
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,490
Thank you, CS2.

503
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,250
Thank you so much for the gifted.

504
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,790
Ray Mack, thank you for the five gifted.

505
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,950
Oh, I didn't see.

506
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,310
Sorry, I did not see.

507
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:43,010
who rated but thank you so much Ducky thank you so much for the gifted I'm scared Doburoku is made with rice chewed up and spit out by Miko oh wait I have heard of that before then Yaku ni tats yaku ni tats ne

508
00:37:48,940 --> 00:38:32,520
I'm scared I'm scared of game game scary game spooky autopsy report undetermined cause of death cause of death case zero nine body was astonishingly malnourished and the calvarium had split open like it had burst from the inside what's the calvaria what is that the cranial bones have been hollowed out and filled with insect eggs later identified as belonging to various species including locusts grasshoppers and crickets Heart of the skull,

509
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:32,920
okay.

510
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,260
Thank you.

511
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,940
No evidence to suggest that they were put there by human hand.

512
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,820
Seemed to be planted by insects naturally.

513
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,940
Highly unusual behavior considering the current harsh winter temperatures.

514
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,220
I'm sorry, what?

515
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,200
We think the bugs just like...

516
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,360
We think like 20 billion ants just lifted up the man and carried them over.

517
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,440
Yeah, another corpse to come through with an inexplicable cause of death.

518
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,040
At least this one was easier to stomach than case 0-8.

519
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,520
All bodies with unexplainable causes of death are kept secret and swiftly handed over to the police department.

520
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,540
In turn, the police department immediately disposes of such bodies without so much as a customary glance.

521
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,100
Additional notes.

522
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,660
This man was suspected of blaspheming against religious doctrine.

523
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,840
He seemed to bear some kind of grudge against the Inari faith.

524
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,240
It's always the same with the...

525
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,080
It's so...

526
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:48,720
so higurashi it's always the same with these strange corpses after all after all they can only be one outcome for not paying reverence to oinari-san oh no new kishi 7 is new kishi 7-ing oh no

527
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,860
oh yashirozama no oinari-san oinari-san

528
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:10,110
okay oh i feel like i'm about to get jump scared like Crazy as soon as I walk out of this room.

529
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,190
Holy.

530
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,090
Please.

531
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,310
Please don't.

532
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:15,830
Please be kind.

533
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:17,750
Can I leave?

534
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,150
Oh wait.

535
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,350
Maybe I did leave.

536
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,330
I have some reason doubt.

537
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,810
You can't be jump scared if you're prepared.

538
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,490
Do you know Oinari- Oinari-sama?

539
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,930
Yes, every- So I used to live in a place that had like...

540
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,890
It was...

541
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,270
I guess I can say it because I don't live there anymore.

542
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,670
I used to live in Jiu-Gaoka.

543
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:53,310
And so every time they say, or every time I read Ebisu-Gaoka, I'm just like, oh, so similar to Jiu-Gaoka.

544
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,950
Okay.

545
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,910
I'm just gonna jump scare.

546
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,070
Ouch.

547
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,270
Just run, just go, just run.

548
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,610
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

549
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,150
Run, run, run, run.

550
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,050
Red went through!

551
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,470
Please!

552
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,690
Oh my god.

553
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,590
I pressed the wrong button even.

554
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,270
I did the heavy attack instead of the not heavy attack.

555
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:22,790
Just leave.

556
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,890
Just get out of there.

557
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:24,630
Just go.

558
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:25,550
Gosh.

559
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,990
She's just screaming in there.

560
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:33,730
Okay.

561
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,790
We don't need to go back to Sensei's house.

562
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,270
Okay.

563
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,330
Dinko's house.

564
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,810
Which way was Dinko's house?

565
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,590
Oh yeah, we did see this little box and we're like, what the heck?

566
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,880
What's she doing over there?

567
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,920
I like the way they dance.

568
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,540
Let's try going in.

569
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,320
This might be even worse of a situation, but

570
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,910
oh my god, so did she.

571
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,090
Okay, we had the same idea.

572
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,010
I'm so sorry.

573
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,170
This is your turf.

574
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,430
My bad.

575
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,510
Can zoom out of the map?

576
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,730
Oh, I guess that's true, right?

577
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,870
There we go.

578
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,270
But...

579
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,070
Uh...

580
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,170
Uh...

581
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,730
I think it's not...

582
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,070
What is the heck?

583
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,610
I think it's not...

584
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,690
Um...

585
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,670
Written yet.

586
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,330
Okay, let's go down this way.

587
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,010
There was another entrance.

588
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,470
to the fields.

589
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,790
Henry, welcome back.

590
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,350
Thank you.

591
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,550
Thank you so much for the 50 gift.

592
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,370
Thank you.

593
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,310
Holy moly.

594
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,930
Thank you so, so much.

595
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:14,860
Come here.

596
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,200
Oh, my God.

597
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,160
Come on.

598
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,560
Oh, this area seems kind of not great to be fighting in, huh?

599
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,180
Because it's like...

600
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,540
Where'd you go?

601
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,620
Oh, there you are.

602
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,160
Do you see me?

603
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,440
Can I get in there or no?

604
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,880
I can't tell, to be honest.

605
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:40,900
Oh, oh my gosh.

606
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,440
Oh my gosh.

607
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
Wait, this kind of area sucks a little bit.

608
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:45,340
Maybe?

609
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,240
You definitely get trapped in here.

610
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,320
Yeah!

611
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,140
Dodge!

612
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,040
Oh, no.

613
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,400
Actually, go forward!

614
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,700
And beat her up!

615
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,360
Ah, dodge!

616
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:03,640
Dodge!

617
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,200
Ah, shoot.

618
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,020
Oh my gosh.

619
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,560
So scary.

620
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,320
So scary.

621
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,380
Ah, dodge!

622
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,180
Oh, we got her.

623
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:17,600
Yay!

624
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,320
Oh, so scary.

625
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,600
So they come out of the mud.

626
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:25,680
Ike.

627
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,840
I hear another one.

628
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,810
Whose house is this?

629
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,210
Hello?

630
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,790
Whose house is this?

631
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,130
Heal?

632
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,210
Everybody's so low.

633
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,250
You think we need to heal?

634
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,410
Oh, yeah, we are.

635
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:57,110
Goop.

636
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:00,870
I don't want to keep...

637
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,210
I don't want to go into any more houses.

638
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,970
I think it's a bad plan.

639
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,190
Going into houses.

640
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,090
All in favor of not...

641
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:09,530
Let her to home.

642
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,450
I no longer recognize my husband.

643
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:15,950
He gets blackout drunk most days now and when he's drunk he turns violent.

644
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:33,550
I don't think I can keep on living this way Not with his cruelty a day after day after day Where did the kind man I met when our marriage was being arranged go my eldest child is only three years old And I have another growing inside me.

645
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,310
Oh my gosh Life is too hard to keep living, but I'm forbidden to die

646
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,510
you asked, no matter what it is.

647
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,870
But this will be my first and last selfish act.

648
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,570
Please forgive me.

649
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,210
Oh my god.

650
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,570
I hate this.

651
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:06,950
I hate this.

652
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:07,650
I hate this.

653
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,010
I hate this.

654
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:08,350
I hate this.

655
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,880
This is why we are not entering people's homes.

656
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,080
Okay, let's go this way.

657
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,720
Japan did arrange marriages.

658
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,600
Oh, yeah, sometimes.

659
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,380
Oh, hello.

660
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:31,660
Oh, my gosh.

661
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,640
Wait, I'm kind of surrounded a little bit.

662
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,400
This is not good.

663
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,180
I'm going to run.

664
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:36,980
Oh, my God.

665
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,100
Wait, I'm really surrounded.

666
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,300
Wait, I'm super surrounded right now.

667
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,460
Okay, hold on.

668
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,180
This is so bad.

669
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,480
Wait.

670
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,360
Okay.

671
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,500
Let's go this.

672
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,260
Let's not go in the field.

673
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,460
Let's...

674
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,880
I think...

675
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,960
Oh my gosh, okay.

676
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,440
Yeah, let's not...

677
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,680
Go in there.

678
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,870
Oh, whoops, wrong button.

679
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,350
My bad.

680
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,060
We'll just keep heading...

681
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,500
this way.

682
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,260
Actually, what's down here?

683
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:31,880
Okay.

684
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,900
Quiet.

685
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,540
I like how the flowers are still blooming, no?

686
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,380
So pretty.

687
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,220
I love Hydrangea.

688
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,620
Are these more houses I can go into?

689
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,480
No, thank you.

690
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,000
Potatoes!

691
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:47,780
Let's go.

692
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,940
This seems like a house I can enter.

693
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,840
Maybe not.

694
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:01,800
Sandage!

695
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,260
I will take that.

696
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:37,990
I hear walking makes me so uncomfortable sorry i know i keep checking the map oh okay there we go wow okay wrinkle damn you own this town oh sheesh okay i hope i can't go in here yay

697
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,090
You know I'm scared when I don't want to explore.

698
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,490
You know it's bad when I'm like...

699
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,870
I don't want to go inside.

700
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,100
I don't want to go... I don't want to...

701
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,820
I don't want to... I don't want to look around.

702
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,420
Me.

703
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,680
I look around everywhere.

704
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,120
Me right now.

705
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,420
I don't want to look around at all.

706
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,540
Let's go down this road.

707
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,020
Let's avoid the horror.

708
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,880
Whatever's growing in here.

709
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,340
Hadao!

710
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,680
Wait, that's so cute.

711
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,160
That's so cute.

712
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,380
Hadao.

713
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,700
Why are you scared?

714
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,600
You're already dead.

715
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,840
Hinako's not dead.

716
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,420
She's very alive and she can die.

717
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,140
I have all that pressure on my shoulders.

718
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,700
Keeping her alive.

719
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,940
You know how hard it is for me?

720
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,880
A dead person?

721
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,700
To try and keep someone alive?

722
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,420
When I failed at doing so?

723
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,460
Oh, Inari-san?

724
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,540
Wait, what is this?

725
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:14,760
Oh.

726
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:20,610
Okay.

727
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,170
My bad.

728
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,490
Don't know what was going on there.

729
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,850
was a little fox, but it was not.

730
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,450
It was actually a man.

731
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,050
My mistake.

732
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,030
I see things.

733
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:44,330
Wait.

734
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,350
You see the stuff in the water?

735
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:53,170
Oh, but... Okay, with the way the camera was, it looked like things were walking past.

736
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:55,370
Oh, see?

737
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,390
You see in the water?

738
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,710
It looks like... I thought things were, like, walking over there.

739
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,130
The reflections, yeah, yeah, yeah.

740
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,190
I don't think there's anything walking.

741
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,450
I guess we'll find out.

742
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,330
So scary.

743
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,570
One, two, baby.

744
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,850
Why is the music getting like this?

745
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,940
There's somebody here.

746
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,140
Oh, there they are.

747
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:38,920
Hello.

748
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,280
Hold on.

749
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,220
Um, I guess we...

750
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,240
We are going the right way though, so...

751
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,260
A bravery song.

752
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,980
Bravery song!

753
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,060
I've never seen her so spooked.

754
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,280
Atmospheric stuff like this really, really gets me good.

755
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,200
It's like the scariest thing for me.

756
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,270
Hey, hey, hey, I was locked on you.

757
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,860
Oh, oh, oh,

758
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,660
oh.

759
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,660
My gosh.

760
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,840
Oh, shit, I was...

761
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,520
Oh, I caught it.

762
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,440
I actually caught it.

763
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,080
Oh my gosh.

764
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,180
Oh my god.

765
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,300
Yeah!

766
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,500
Oh, that was kind of, that was more smooth.

767
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:02,900
Okay.

768
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,960
I'm getting used to it a little bit.

769
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,460
Oh, my pipe though.

770
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,160
It's halfway already.

771
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,260
Okay.

772
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:14,940
Phew.

773
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:15,800
Yeah.

774
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,380
Okay.

775
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,700
Onwards and upwards.

776
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,140
Anything in here?

777
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:25,860
Like a pipe?

778
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,280
Surely.

779
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,840
Oh, I took it!

780
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,480
Wait, okay, back?

781
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,800
items

782
00:53:42,320 --> 00:54:01,380
um wait why can't i hold the toolkit i'm so confused there's literally a slot for it do you like outside loot what do you mean check out this fancy new inside homes loot it's new and fancy no no i don't want inside home loot use from your lv

783
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,040
Wait, so can I grab it now?

784
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:09,720
No.

785
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,120
Wait, why can't I take it?

786
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,500
That's so strange, right?

787
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,680
Isn't that not so weird, though, that it doesn't just put it into the slot?

788
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,980
There's also an item limit.

789
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,640
Oh, okay.

790
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,260
Well, let me see what...

791
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,360
I had one...

792
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,660
Not Ramanay.

793
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,760
Slightly restores health.

794
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,900
when used continuously.

795
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,080
I had one drink.

796
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,160
Oh, the divine water.

797
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,560
Fully restores current, max sanity, and reduces sanity damage taken for a set time.

798
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:45,700
Ah.

799
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,440
Maybe I'll eat the crackers.

800
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,740
Or I can...

801
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,420
Oh, or...

802
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:57,780
Oh, wait.

803
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,380
I can just drink something, too, right?

804
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,620
Like, I don't have to fully dispose of something.

805
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,120
if I, like, eat this, I should be able to take it now, right?

806
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,320
What?

807
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,160
Okay, we'll eat the Araday then.

808
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,020
Oh, wait.

809
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:15,280
Yeah.

810
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,360
What is that?

811
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,480
Sorry, I am... Oh, first aid kit.

812
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,280
What you're there?

813
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,380
Some items stack.

814
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,140
But, like, it's...

815
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,380
I'm so confused because it's, like, in my...

816
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,000
Thing?

817
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,600
So I'm like, why can't I just grab it?

818
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,280
You know what I mean?

819
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,340
It's confusing me so much.

820
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,860
But I'll eat this.

821
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,260
My sanity is not bad.

822
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,380
And neither is my health.

823
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,320
But I guess...

824
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,980
You have 8 out of 8 items.

825
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,560
Okay.

826
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,740
Toolkit's important, though.

827
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,700
Toolkit's very important.

828
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,340
Am I going the right way?

829
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,320
Yes.

830
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,400
It seems I am.

831
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,120
Nani?

832
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:28,350
How side loot is there for anyone who needs to take against side loot is just stealing because being responsible member of society?

833
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,010
Um, what was that?

834
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,130
Yeah, uh, Nani?

835
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:33,850
Uh, yeah, Nani?

836
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,960
Did I go the wrong way?

837
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,120
Oh my god!

838
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,300
What do you mean?

839
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,700
There's not just just just just mannequins or

840
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,020
Nani, gasky!

841
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:04,840
None of this.

842
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,320
I'm so sweaty right now.

843
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,320
Okay.

844
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,180
I want to save, but I did not see anything to save with.

845
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,020
It's so sad.

846
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,740
Wait, what I was going to do was...

847
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:24,300
You guys think I should use the toolkit on my other pipe?

848
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,140
Okay.

849
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,280
I'm wondering.

850
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,600
Not yet.

851
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:34,960
No.

852
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,800
I mean, we'll just continue with this one for now.

853
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,960
Wait, what's this?

854
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,660
Oh, okay.

855
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,840
Take that for sure.

856
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:42,320
Wait.

857
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,740
Oh, this is a...

858
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,600
Oh my god.

859
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,800
I'm so stupid.

860
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,740
I have to go all the way back around.

861
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,020
Maybe it's eating the other mannequins.

862
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,410
Oh

863
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:23,100
Minto phantom Who do you like more than me?

864
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,560
Huh?

865
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,580
Should I go save?

866
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,820
Probably not.

867
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,360
My auto save.

868
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,160
Oh my god, I see them walking in the distance.

869
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,040
Oh my gosh, I don't want to go that way!

870
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,540
I don't want to go that way!

871
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,160
Guys, that was a rhetorical question.

872
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,060
Don't actually answer it!

873
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,020
You're gonna make me sad!

874
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,720
Okay, I haven't gotten a save though since the house.

875
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,780
That's why I'm worried.

876
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:10,940
Let's go save.

877
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,040
I go save, I go save, I go save.

878
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,740
No, no, no, no.

879
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:25,980
Oh my god!

880
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:26,960
Please!

881
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,700
Not hot dog!

882
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,760
Not hot dog moment.

883
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,900
I'm never gonna beat this game at this rate.

884
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:39,680
Ah!

885
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,640
How did it see me?

886
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,300
Why did it have to see me?

887
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,080
Did it hear me running?

888
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,040
Is that why?

889
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,140
Yeah, leave.

890
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,020
Ugly.

891
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,660
Oh my gosh.

892
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:16,140
I heard the hot dog.

893
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,240
Wish I could sneak past.

894
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,400
Maybe I can.

895
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,000
Act natural.

896
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:25,760
Act natural.

897
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,700
Don't look.

898
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:27,640
Don't look.

899
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,540
Act natural.

900
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,980
Okay.

901
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,660
Well, I did save.

902
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,700
I feel a little bit better now.

903
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,160
I don't feel better.

904
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,940
I don't feel better at all, actually.

905
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:50,520
Hi!

906
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:51,840
Oh!

907
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:54,900
Turn around!

908
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,800
Maybe they have bad eyesight.

909
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,700
Well, oh, that's the case, isn't it, right?

910
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,940
But they have bad eyesight and they can hear you.

911
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,440
More than they can see you, right?

912
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,420
I forgot about that.

913
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,640
Because their eyes are, like, all messed up.

914
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,420
Right?

915
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,600
I can walk through this, right?

916
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,520
Hinako, don't be stupid.

917
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,590
Oh, Toriko, thank you so much for the gift.

918
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:49,490
Thank you.

919
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:50,470
Ah!

920
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,410
Silent Hill.

921
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,000
Silent Hill.

922
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,110
What now?

923
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:27,710
Oh my god!

924
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:29,430
Oh my god!

925
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,300
Ah!

926
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,160
I tried dodging!

927
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,620
I did.

928
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,280
Yeah, stupid.

929
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,480
There we go.

930
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:44,840
Okay.

931
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,100
I think.

932
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:46,880
No.

933
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:47,340
No.

934
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:47,940
Oh, my God.

935
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,680
Oh, I'm so screwed right now.

936
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,920
I'm so screwed right now.

937
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:51,820
Oh, my God.

938
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:52,660
Oh.

939
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,000
Ah, shoot.

940
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,040
Oh, shoot.

941
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, gosh.

942
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:58,340
Oh, gosh.

943
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,080
Oh, I'm so screwed.

944
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,200
I'm so screwed.

945
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,080
I'm so screwed.

946
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,620
You guys, uh, we're screwed.

947
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,240
We're so screwed.

948
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:03,960
We're so screwed.

949
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:04,660
We're so screwed.

950
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,240
There's three of them.

951
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:05,960
There's three of them.

952
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,220
Oh, God.

953
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:11,700
Oh, golly.

954
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,060
Okay.

955
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,440
Wait.

956
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,100
You know what?

957
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:14,820
That's fine, actually.

958
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,180
Oh, my God.

959
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,460
Oh, I got stuck!

960
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:21,980
I got stuck, for real.

961
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,380
Just keep going.

962
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,980
Just run.

963
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,380
Actually, just run.

964
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,520
You know what?

965
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,420
Oh.

966
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,040
It would do that.

967
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,340
Okay.

968
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,400
Let's run.

969
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:40,920
Oh, just run.

970
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:44,480
Just get out of here.

971
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,600
Maybe I can handle her a little bit better here.

972
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:51,840
Okay.

973
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,520
Oh my gosh, I can't get the timing on it, though.

974
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,140
Oh my god!

975
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,040
Oh, don't come over here, please!

976
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:01,500
Please!

977
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,240
Spare me!

978
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:06,960
Yeah.

979
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:12,600
Ouch!

980
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,500
Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

981
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:13,960
Oh shit.

982
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,120
Oops.

983
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:15,820
Oh, oh my god.

984
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,240
Oh my god.

985
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,220
Oh!

986
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:22,860
Uh...

987
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,700
Take, take, take.

988
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,340
Take, take, take.

989
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,910
Oh my god, wait!

990
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,650
What do you mean?

991
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,870
My weapon will break!

992
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:36,950
Uh-oh.

993
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:37,530
Already?

994
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:38,310
Oop,

995
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:45,450
oop, oop.

996
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:46,830
Yeah, it's fine.

997
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:48,750
It's over?

998
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:49,390
Is it?

999
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:50,430
Is it over?

1000
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,130
Is it over?

1001
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,150
Oh my gosh, please say yes!

1002
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,730
What was in here?

1003
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:03,070
Nothing?

1004
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,430
Wow, that's rude.

1005
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,580
Oh, I didn't think we were gonna live that.

1006
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,900
Guys, good job.

1007
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,620
Good job, team.

1008
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,920
I didn't think we were gonna live through that at all.

1009
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,240
Holy!

1010
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,980
Both of my weapons are pretty busted, so let's use the toolkit on whichever one, I guess, suppose.

1011
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:32,800
Whew.

1012
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,840
Okay, um, you know, we can just keep on keeping on.

1013
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:40,220
Ah!

1014
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,600
Ah!

1015
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,160
Ah!

1016
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,700
Oh shoot, wrong button.

1017
01:05:55,790 --> 01:06:00,250
Can I go you put me into a false state of security?

1018
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:02,650
I'm just gonna run.

1019
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:07,150
Oh wait, there's something here though.

1020
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:08,530
Grab it!

1021
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:09,570
Chocolate!

1022
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,340
Get

1023
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:20,630
the chocolate and go?

1024
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,230
Okay, maybe we're safe?

1025
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,230
Did someone say chocolate?

1026
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,980
She was like, oh, it's finally over.

1027
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,660
Hinako, you put me in a false state of security!

1028
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,500
It's your fault!

1029
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,360
Hmm.

1030
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,160
This way?

1031
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:47,800
Wait.

1032
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,540
No, I need to turn this way.

1033
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,440
Go into the red.

1034
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,040
Oh, we're going into the nasty.

1035
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,240
This way?

1036
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:12,780
Does he mean?

1037
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,080
Sure wish I could find a save right now.

1038
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,100
I don't know if the game saved.

1039
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:19,740
I didn't...

1040
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,080
I have...

1041
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,300
Oh, the game just saved!

1042
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:21,960
Yippee!

1043
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:22,480
Okay.

1044
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:27,680
Shoo, why can't I hear you?

1045
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,760
Where are you?

1046
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,600
Oh my god, the game was like, you just went through it.

1047
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:32,940
Here's...

1048
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,840
Another pipe!

1049
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,780
Oh, Ryan, now we have three.

1050
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,160
Where in...

1051
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,860
This place is like a farming town.

1052
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,080
No, why can't we find like a machete or something?

1053
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,140
The game was like, you've been through it.

1054
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,720
Don't worry.

1055
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,860
We'll reward you.

1056
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:51,960
Another toolkit.

1057
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,320
I wish, though, I could find a save.

1058
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,360
I was going to say a save so I could do an offering.

1059
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:19,740
Okay.

1060
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,060
Let's see.

1061
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,680
Is there anything that I can get rid of?

1062
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:31,790
Ghost?

1063
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:37,610
Why do I have two different kinds of...

1064
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,350
Does this, what, does it, what, that's strange.

1065
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,970
I only have two different kinds of bandages.

1066
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:43,290
What's my health like at anyway?

1067
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,370
I will use one.

1068
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:50,090
Nice.

1069
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:55,170
Japanese didn't invent machetes until 1997.

1070
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,090
It can only stack up to three.

1071
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,630
Okay, well, maybe now...

1072
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:02,910
You guys, oh, my bad, wrong thing.

1073
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,810
You guys say I have like a...

1074
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:05,370
Oh, there it is.

1075
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,690
Okay, so it is seven out of eight now.

1076
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:07,510
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

1077
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,010
Okie dokie.

1078
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:18,220
It's locked.

1079
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:32,270
Cut scene.

1080
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,350
That doesn't make me feel good.

1081
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:36,290
And in this area?

1082
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:36,890
Oh no.

1083
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:39,430
Uh oh.

1084
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:39,790
Wait.

1085
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,290
What do you mean here it comes?

1086
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:42,690
What do you mean?

1087
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,050
Wait.

1088
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,110
Holy!

1089
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:52,310
What?

1090
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,420
Oh my god!

1091
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,090
What's the storehouse?

1092
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:11,510
This one?

1093
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:14,210
Here?

1094
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:17,530
Holy!

1095
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:19,010
Oh my god!

1096
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:20,210
Oh,

1097
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:27,720
he's disgusting!

1098
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,360
He looks angry.

1099
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,420
Let's loop him.

1100
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,500
Can I loop him?

1101
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:34,960
Oh!

1102
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,200
Okay, awesome.

1103
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,440
What's the storehouse, Jule?

1104
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,280
Open a window, where?

1105
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,280
Here?

1106
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:48,120
Oh.

1107
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,860
I'm good.

1108
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,220
Oh, but I need the key first.

1109
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,080
Oh, okay, okay.

1110
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,080
Good thing I was trying to grab before.

1111
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,240
Loop up up.

1112
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,120
Okay, let's loop him again, maybe.

1113
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,910
Oh, I gotta crank it.

1114
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:24,510
Oh, my God.

1115
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,450
Are you...

1116
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,150
I don't like this.

1117
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:31,330
Ah!

1118
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,360
We were so close!

1119
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1120
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,940
Okay, I'm gonna die for sure.

1121
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,640
Does it save my progress or do I have to do that all over again?

1122
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:46,500
Dang.

1123
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,260
I'm cranking it.

1124
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,160
I'm not even gonna save.

1125
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,320
Oh, surely!

1126
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,820
Or, like, I'm not gonna heal is what I mean.

1127
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,000
Because, uh...

1128
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,360
I feel like...

1129
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,620
It'll just... I could just...

1130
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,080
Yeah, I know.

1131
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,640
Oh, there he is.

1132
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,560
We'll just redo it if I die.

1133
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:17,320
It's okay.

1134
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,680
We'll just redo it.

1135
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,430
This might be bad.

1136
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:27,430
This might be bad.

1137
01:12:27,530 --> 01:12:29,250
Oh my god, I really have to do it all over again.

1138
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,170
Oh

1139
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,280
my gosh.

1140
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,120
Oh my gosh.

1141
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,190
We're dead.

1142
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:46,130
Wait, I kind of want to see the death animation though.

1143
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,120
Holy cow!

1144
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,580
Oh my god, that's crazy.

1145
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:00,780
Okay.

1146
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,280
All right, cool.

1147
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,380
Very nice.

1148
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,060
Dang.

1149
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:07,540
Okay.

1150
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,340
this out, huh?

1151
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:20,340
I feel like looping him is the best option, but Patrick really let himself go after SpongeBob's death.

1152
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:20,640
Ah!

1153
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:24,720
Oh!

1154
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,120
Is there anything else around here?

1155
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,660
Oh yeah, the toolkit.

1156
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,820
Which we got, we ate.

1157
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,780
Or we used a bandage.

1158
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:43,760
I mean, honestly, that puts us in a pretty good position for this fight, But...

1159
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:52,030
Gets me every time.

1160
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,090
Shoot, where are you?

1161
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:03,860
That was a sick kill.

1162
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,840
I don't want it to happen again though.

1163
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:14,150
Dude regenerates, so fighting him just waste weapons.

1164
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,050
You're right to loop him.

1165
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:15,870
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

1166
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:16,650
That's what I figured.

1167
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:18,510
I was like, this guy is...

1168
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:21,290
I think at our current stand.

1169
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:25,770
so this guy is too meaty.

1170
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,480
Okay, I know what to do, though.

1171
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:33,880
Ish.

1172
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,320
I don't know if this is the right... This seems like the right place to loop him.

1173
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:44,940
I probably just have to get him, like, right here and then I go do it or something.

1174
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:46,640
Okay.

1175
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:47,940
Let's try again.

1176
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:55,980
I have heard people saying that this game sometimes gets, like, like for some of these bosses?

1177
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,900
I'm kind of scared about that.

1178
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,100
Takes a long time to recover.

1179
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,460
Oh, he takes a long time to recover from attacks too.

1180
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,140
If you dodge an attack, it will give you more time to crank.

1181
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:07,720
True.

1182
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,760
True, true, true, true.

1183
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,640
Okay, here we go.

1184
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,420
This game is Silent Souls.

1185
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,360
Why is it like this is two scariest genres ever?

1186
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:35,620
Mintos First Souls like honestly actually though this guy looks like a he looks so cool and nasty

1187
01:15:45,170 --> 01:16:05,780
yeah he's pretty dick I and I can't tell oh oh dang I misread what his attack was but it's okay I'm gonna keep looping him come this way Come this way, big boy.

1188
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,440
Come this way, big boy.

1189
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:13,920
Oh, okay.

1190
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:14,620
Just kidding.

1191
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,520
Oh, okay, yeah.

1192
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,600
So I can avoid that attack, it seems.

1193
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,740
It doesn't reach me here.

1194
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,280
I'm trying to get him over here, though.

1195
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:22,800
Okay.

1196
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:25,160
Maybe this is enough time.

1197
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,180
Oh, it's not enough time!

1198
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,440
It's not enough time at all.

1199
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:33,580
Okay.

1200
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:34,700
Very cool.

1201
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,660
Oh, he turned around real fast.

1202
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,640
Where?

1203
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,860
How could you tell where I was, actually?

1204
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:44,920
Oh!

1205
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:45,740
Oh, ew.

1206
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,000
Okay, I was too close for there.

1207
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:47,800
Oh, my God.

1208
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:49,960
Oh,

1209
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:56,410
my God!

1210
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:56,930
He drank!

1211
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,270
Oh, my gosh.

1212
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:58,650
Okay.

1213
01:16:59,050 --> 01:16:59,490
I'm still...

1214
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,050
I'm still...

1215
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:00,630
I'm learning!

1216
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:01,510
Oh!

1217
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:05,010
Okay.

1218
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:06,430
Ouch!

1219
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,910
F stands for Dark Souls.

1220
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:10,750
Okay.

1221
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:12,930
This door?

1222
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,300
I really need to like loop him, get him over more.

1223
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,170
Oh gosh, wait, I don't know.

1224
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,330
I don't know if this is enough time.

1225
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:33,530
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1226
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:35,030
Oh, I don't know, I don't think so.

1227
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,250
Oh, I don't think so.

1228
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:38,430
What do you mean?

1229
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:42,410
Hinako!

1230
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,310
This is life or death, please!

1231
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:45,410
Walk in!

1232
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:54,680
Oh my god, oh my god!

1233
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:55,840
Oh my gosh.

1234
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1235
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,680
A slide can hurt.

1236
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,100
I know, it took away half my health, pretty much.

1237
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,800
I've already experienced it.

1238
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:33,550
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1239
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:33,630
Maybe?

1240
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:34,530
Maybe now?

1241
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,090
I don't think so.

1242
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:39,530
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

1243
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:40,570
Come on, come on, come on!

1244
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,100
No, stinking way.

1245
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,060
Girl.

1246
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:55,950
Did I get it?

1247
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,420
Come over here.

1248
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,280
Oh, he doesn't...

1249
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,500
He doesn't want to work how I want him to.

1250
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,740
I want to loop him, but he's not letting me.

1251
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,240
At least the hay kind of, like, blocks him a little bit, so it's not so bad.

1252
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,220
He's like a big cat.

1253
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:36,880
I wish.

1254
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,940
Come, come, come, come this side.

1255
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,480
I think I should have gone there, but it's okay.

1256
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,080
I'm trying to get him over a little bit more, right here.

1257
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:01,060
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come to go, come!

1258
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,900
Just need him to move a little bit more.

1259
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,360
There we go.

1260
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,400
Okay, maybe now?

1261
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:12,590
Oh my god, please!

1262
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:13,150
Please!

1263
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:14,210
Oh, I was... Nope.

1264
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:15,090
I don't think so.

1265
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,870
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

1266
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:22,150
Oh, he sucks.

1267
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:26,900
Ooh!

1268
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:27,640
That was close.

1269
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:52,180
wish there was a way I could put away my weapon so I could like run a little bit faster you know oh shoot ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch oh this is not good

1270
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:11,650
Uh-oh, he's right here.

1271
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,550
He's right next to me, isn't he?

1272
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,250
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1273
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:18,970
Oh, I got it!

1274
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,790
Yes!

1275
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:20,730
Okay.

1276
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,150
Third time's a charm, baby!

1277
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:24,590
Okay!

1278
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,770
Are you kidding me right now, please?

1279
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:35,610
You're not going to get up!

1280
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:36,490
You're not going!

1281
01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:00,980
Oh, wait, oh, I have to hold these now too?

1282
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,860
Oh, you're kidding me.

1283
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,040
Oh, this...

1284
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,780
Oh my god.

1285
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,510
I bet there was good loot in there though.

1286
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:28,610
There's nothing actually?

1287
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:29,350
No way.

1288
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:31,130
That's so rude.

1289
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,490
Oh my gosh.

1290
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,470
Oh, he's actually here.

1291
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,810
Thank you for the capsules.

1292
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:46,530
I used a couple bandages.

1293
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:49,830
I probably didn't need to use so many bandages, but...

1294
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,650
It is what it is.

1295
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,610
The best loot is being alive.

1296
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:57,310
So true!

1297
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:58,110
Wait.

1298
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:58,770
Oh.

1299
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,720
My lights flickered.

1300
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,220
Good job, gamer.

1301
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,600
Thank you.

1302
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,540
Even though it wasn't so great towards the end, but that's okay.

1303
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,160
I thought this was a place to save.

1304
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:19,940
Oh, well.

1305
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,560
Oh, there's a place to save.

1306
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:24,260
I'm blind.

1307
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,680
We pray.

1308
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:44,460
Freaky.

1309
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,350
Oh, it only gives us not so much, though.

1310
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,370
I'd rather eat it.

1311
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,060
Anything over here?

1312
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:06,060
Oh, I can relax a little.

1313
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,820
Get some sanity back.

1314
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,320
What's my sanity looking like?

1315
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,020
No, their sanity's fine.

1316
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:21,520
Okay, wait.

1317
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:25,200
Just to recap, the top flowers are sanity.

1318
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,900
Middle's my health and bottoms my stamina.

1319
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:32,180
And then the moon is my weapon durability, right?

1320
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:33,860
Okay.

1321
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,890
Yes, okay.

1322
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,070
Oh, that leaf?

1323
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:42,690
That leaf scared me.

1324
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,610
Oh, shoo!

1325
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,010
Shoo, don't do that!

1326
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:51,470
Why would you just be standing there, man?

1327
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:52,890
What's wrong with you?

1328
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,210
Oh my gosh.

1329
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:57,470
Ah!

1330
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,960
Shoo, what's wrong with you, you psychopath?

1331
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,420
This looks like it's readable.

1332
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,320
Oh, wait, what's this?

1333
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,340
Oh, more bandage, nice.

1334
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,200
We're looking around a little bit.

1335
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:29,630
What's this?

1336
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,350
Emma!

1337
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:32,950
A wooden plaque.

1338
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:36,230
Place it back in a hokora after writing your wishes.

1339
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:38,150
Upgrade ability!

1340
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:39,690
Okay.

1341
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,330
I'll do that.

1342
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:42,730
Gasoline?

1343
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:45,450
Hikashi.

1344
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:46,830
Oh, it's a...

1345
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,650
Shinako Senori is okay, but how's Vito?

1346
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:55,450
By the Vito, I got to see you in San Diego on stage like a...

1347
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:56,470
Oh, I get to see!

1348
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,750
I was like, got to see me!

1349
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,870
Get to see you in San Diego on stage like a barbecue!

1350
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:00,950
Thank you!

1351
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:01,790
Thank you!

1352
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:02,370
Thank you!

1353
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:07,510
Fully restore stamina and prevents stamina consumption for a set period.

1354
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,690
We'll hold that off for now.

1355
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,750
Wait, let's go back to the shrine then.

1356
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,350
from the future.

1357
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,270
What's the guy's name?

1358
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,390
In Steinsgate.

1359
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:25,630
Tudor.

1360
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:26,970
John Tudor.

1361
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,110
Is that his name?

1362
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:32,840
Titor.

1363
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,060
John Titor.

1364
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:39,620
That's you.

1365
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:40,920
That's you right now.

1366
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,180
You can always offer some stuff.

1367
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,300
You don't... Yeah.

1368
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,900
I was thinking that...

1369
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:47,500
Okay, hold on.

1370
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:52,240
You can use a blank Emma and Faith to pray at Ahokura and increase your max health stamina and sanity.

1371
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,800
You can also increase the number of Omamori get equipped at a time.

1372
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,610
So how do I do?

1373
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,700
Do I...

1374
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:05,080
How do I do?

1375
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,450
Oh, and here it is, pray.

1376
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:11,470
Seriously, I need 500!

1377
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:13,350
Oh no!

1378
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,010
1500 for Omamori slots.

1379
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:24,980
Yikes.

1380
01:27:41,880 --> 01:28:08,760
greatly restores current sanity or current max sanity but it's only 20 divine waters 50 wait okay hold on we're doing math so it's like 110 100 and oh wait okay wait 110 for these two and then 90.

1381
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:13,760
so 300 380.

1382
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:20,740
So I don't even have enough to I wouldn't, if I sold everything, I wouldn't have enough.

1383
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,000
Wait, was I off by a bit?

1384
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,800
Oh, it's 280?

1385
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:25,300
Wait.

1386
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:26,600
Is that what?

1387
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:27,720
280.

1388
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:35,110
It's taking up your inventory.

1389
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:35,770
I know.

1390
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,490
But I could eat it.

1391
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:41,770
This one greatly restores my health.

1392
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,680
Oh, and you have 100, so 380 total.

1393
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:49,800
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1394
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,640
We have to save it for Silent Hill F2.

1395
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:09,000
I'll get rid of the ones that are just like the...

1396
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,600
You can... It will not be consumed for a set time or whatever.

1397
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,860
Because I feel like I'm really bad at it.

1398
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:45,880
using at like timing those kinds of things so this one only slightly restores your current max sanity but sanity will not be consumed when using focus for a set time but i i'm not gonna be able to time it i think like i don't know how long what is a set time you know so we'll get rid of that thank you and let's go get the higashi shu you're gonna be the death of me It lasts like 30 seconds.

1399
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,040
Okay, okay.

1400
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,740
If nothing, gamble everything.

1401
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:50,820
Cool!

1402
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,760
Too scary.

1403
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:56,400
I gotta hold...

1404
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,380
What if I have no bandages?

1405
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,160
What if I have no pills?

1406
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,960
I gotta take my pills.

1407
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,460
Is there anything else in here?

1408
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:07,960
No.

1409
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,200
Just the candy.

1410
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:11,800
Okay.

1411
01:30:17,490 --> 01:30:19,150
I'm enjoying the break.

1412
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:23,810
Is there anything over here?

1413
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,250
There might be something on top.

1414
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,410
A brief moment of rest.

1415
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:34,290
Just a bunch of hay.

1416
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,510
Just a whole lot of hay.

1417
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:38,510
Okay.

1418
01:30:42,230 --> 01:30:44,770
I usually enshrine one from a stack of three, so I have room for another.

1419
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:47,250
That's... smart.

1420
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:55,070
I don't actually quite understand the sanity factor of this game yet.

1421
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,330
What does it, like, affect how you...

1422
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:59,750
How you fight?

1423
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:01,810
Or, like, what does...

1424
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:03,850
What's gonna happen to me?

1425
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,010
We'll do one.

1426
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,490
And we'll do one.

1427
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:11,770
And we'll do...

1428
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:15,230
This one also fully restores stamina and prevents stamina consumption for a set period of time.

1429
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:17,050
This one fully restores your stamina.

1430
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:18,850
Sorry.

1431
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,190
Did I say salmon?

1432
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:22,970
I think I want salmon.

1433
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:30,170
It's no eternal darkness, I've just dreamed.

1434
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:40,920
Salmonella.

1435
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,500
This seems a little fishy.

1436
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,600
Fully restores Max.

1437
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,900
Greatly restores health.

1438
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,440
Greatly restores sanity.

1439
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:52,900
You know what?

1440
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,500
I'm gonna get rid of all the ramen there.

1441
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,040
I think it's okay.

1442
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:00,920
Okay, we're at 270.

1443
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,220
And that also free...

1444
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:04,580
Oh, wait.

1445
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,500
Did I...

1446
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,630
Kikashi's really good if you have trouble with stamina.

1447
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:11,710
That's what I was just thinking.

1448
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:14,910
I was just like, if it fully restores stamina, I feel like that's pretty good, no?

1449
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:16,370
Ah.

1450
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:20,190
Health.

1451
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:21,870
This is also sanity.

1452
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:24,750
I'll get rid of it.

1453
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:27,570
What do I...

1454
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:28,450
Wait, what do I...

1455
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:28,830
Hold on.

1456
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:29,810
I get rid of it.

1457
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:31,050
What do I have for sanity?

1458
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:31,850
Ah!

1459
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:34,850
I don't have any items for sanity.

1460
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:39,290
So just in case I'm really in a pickle where I need a sanity...

1461
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:41,630
Oh, I guess the pills help a little bit.

1462
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:44,690
But I might want to keep something for sanity just in case.

1463
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,090
The stamina in this game gets brutal sometimes.

1464
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,250
I'd recommend holding on to any sort of stamina helping thing.

1465
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,410
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I think this is fine for now.

1466
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:55,650
Oh, let's pray.

1467
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,150
And we pray.

1468
01:32:59,150 --> 01:32:59,530
Where are you at?

1469
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:00,070
Okay.

1470
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,950
Oh, my bad.

1471
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:05,730
Okie dokie.

1472
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,460
What you doing over there, Shu?

1473
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,490
Don't, why are you kissing turtles?

1474
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,110
Turtles have Salmonella?

1475
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:25,770
That was the first I've ever heard that before.

1476
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:29,330
This is the first time I've ever heard that before.

1477
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,050
Natsukashi, here.

1478
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,950
Relatable.

1479
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,280
I was a young boy.

1480
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,300
I had to cry and cry.

1481
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:41,800
I remember crying.

1482
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:46,120
You can't imagine anything.

1483
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:46,820
I can't imagine.

1484
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:50,540
I have a long time I have a long time.

1485
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:51,900
No.

1486
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:59,260
You have to do anything to keep your mind and put your heart into the bad way.

1487
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,300
Relatable?

1488
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,040
I thought he just jumped into the water.

1489
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:11,800
There's...

1490
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,280
Stop showing off.

1491
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,660
There's literally a bridge right there.

1492
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:22,280
Why are you playing around so much right now?

1493
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,480
This is not the time.

1494
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,860
He's giving you Satoshi and Keiji vibes.

1495
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:30,940
It's the bat.

1496
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,980
Have you ever been?

1497
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,200
This is such a difficult moment.

1498
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,640
I remember all the memories I remember.

1499
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,580
Now, every one of them is very much.

1500
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:50,190
If it's going to get it, I'll never die.

1501
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,370
I'll be sure to talk to you about it.

1502
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,450
Aibo.

1503
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:00,210
Thank you, Aibo.

1504
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:06,850
Imagine getting partner-zoned.

1505
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,760
Why does this keep happening?

1506
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:26,500
Escape?

1507
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,040
That's...

1508
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,580
Memories of getting lost.

1509
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,740
There was this one time where I played hide-and-seek with a bunch of my friends when I was young.

1510
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,540
I got so excited and ran far away because I didn't...

1511
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,760
didn't want anyone to find me.

1512
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,660
Eventually I got lost around here.

1513
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,880
I was sobbing and hollering and walked the wrong way for hours.

1514
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,640
Actually, I was told later that it was the exact opposite direction of my house.

1515
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,740
Even a town as small as this felt huge for me as a kid.

1516
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,020
I realized that I knew nothing about the town.

1517
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,980
Even these fields seemed to spread out endlessly into the horizon.

1518
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:00,180
Oh!

1519
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:08,640
Okay, I could really rely on you, but now, I will

1520
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:42,040
mysterious note the field that's all misty is really scary I keep thinking someone's there but it's always just a scarecrow with a creepy face but there's one scarecrow that's actually not scary the only reason it's making a scary face is because it's got a thorn sticking into it and it's hurt it's got a big thorn up its butt so all you have to do is take the thorn out and it'll tell you which way to go to get close to the really scary scarecrow's.

1521
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:46,860
Someone said there's a monster who's only pretending to be a scarecrow that likes eating little kids.

1522
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,040
Look at the little doll.

1523
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,200
What's here?

1524
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:01,440
Oh, the music is too...

1525
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,240
Freaky!

1526
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:03,800
It's too freaky!

1527
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:06,480
Wait, if I go back this way, is there anything over here?

1528
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:15,550
I guess...

1529
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:15,990
not.

1530
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:17,370
Oh, oh, okay.

1531
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:23,940
Aibo!

1532
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:28,360
So we have to find the scarecrow that is...

1533
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,800
It's not actually scary.

1534
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,920
Oh, wait!

1535
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:33,920
It's these girls!

1536
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,040
Oh my gosh, wait!

1537
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,660
I've been so excited to see them!

1538
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,020
They're so scary!

1539
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:42,480
These are the girls that were handing out pamphlets at TGX.

1540
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,360
Talk to the scarecrow first.

1541
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:46,940
Oh, this guy?

1542
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:51,700
Can't you even imagine how I feel?

1543
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,560
I'll put on my polite smile for now.

1544
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,240
Well-maintained tool for cutting grass.

1545
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:02,800
It's easy to use, but I have some doubts about how long it will last.

1546
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,380
I guess we'll get rid of this guy.

1547
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,760
Actually, is it that much better?

1548
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:20,350
Tool.

1549
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:22,770
A giant repulsive lump of flesh.

1550
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,230
Need to try, yeah?

1551
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:26,610
Well, let's take note.

1552
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:27,890
bad.

1553
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:34,350
It lumps of flesh that is filled to the brim with a maniacal angler.

1554
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:39,050
It howls awfully as it swings its large knife in any which direction.

1555
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:42,250
Its unfettered anger is no different from that of a wild animal.

1556
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:42,890
No.

1557
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:44,430
It's far worse than that.

1558
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,590
Is that this game's pyramid head?

1559
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:50,590
Okay, goodbye.

1560
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,830
Second steel pipe.

1561
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,910
I hate commitment.

1562
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:08,160
The masks and the, like, the faces on the back, too.

1563
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,700
Wait, so who's got a stick up their butt?

1564
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,760
Is it that one over there?

1565
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:14,380
That one's got a thing in their back.

1566
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:20,020
Pyramid Head is this game's pyramid head.

1567
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:21,820
Just stick him in the game.

1568
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:22,460
It doesn't matter.

1569
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:24,580
Are they...

1570
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,760
Are they, like, moving?

1571
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:26,360
No.

1572
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,760
Okay, I thought they were, like...

1573
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:30,400
What's it called?

1574
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:32,980
Um...

1575
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:41,240
I thought they were, uh...

1576
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,720
What's the angel?

1577
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,080
Weeping angel, yes.

1578
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,380
So this one has something stabbed in its back.

1579
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,240
Uh-oh, did she get back stabbed?

1580
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,360
Is it symbolism?

1581
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:02,730
You?

1582
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,220
You?

1583
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,700
Oh, it's so scary.

1584
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,620
Oh my god, wait, this is awesome.

1585
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,700
Oh wait, it does have like a little thing stuck in it.

1586
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,060
Is it you?

1587
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,880
It doesn't look like she's smiling.

1588
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,360
Oh that's right, it did say that it would put on its polite smile, right?

1589
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:43,080
Sometimes I hear like, it sounds like running.

1590
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,020
This one's smiling.

1591
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,080
Was that me walking or?

1592
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:55,240
Hold on, can it, I'll put on my polite smile for now.

1593
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:06,750
You hear that, right?

1594
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:11,790
Something is moving, it's not me.

1595
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:15,930
Oh, it's that one!

1596
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:17,390
Ah!

1597
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:21,570
So that one, back there, in the middle, is evil.

1598
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:23,550
Okay, okay, okay.

1599
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:36,910
She's not smiling, either.

1600
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:40,790
So freaky.

1601
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:41,690
E!

1602
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,350
Oh!

1603
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:45,030
Ouch!

1604
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,010
Oh, okay.

1605
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:47,190
That's what that does.

1606
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:49,030
Oh, I didn't realize she would come to life.

1607
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,890
I'm such an idiot.

1608
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:51,750
Okay, I- Oh, oh gosh.

1609
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:52,030
Okay.

1610
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:52,850
Ouch!

1611
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:54,150
Wait, can I redo?

1612
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,490
Can I restart?

1613
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,270
Ah, I didn't realize!

1614
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,740
Oh my god, they're tough, too.

1615
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:10,380
Oh, oops, oops.

1616
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,140
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1617
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:13,660
I'm gonna die.

1618
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:14,780
I want to restart.

1619
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,400
They're fast, yeah.

1620
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:26,220
Oh my god, I'm pressing the wrong button over and over and over again.

1621
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:27,660
I'm such an idiot.

1622
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:29,340
I want to restart.

1623
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,040
I messed up.

1624
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,380
I want to restart.

1625
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:43,620
I want to restart.

1626
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:44,660
And

1627
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,460
the freaky one's gone, too.

1628
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,120
Oh wait, no, she's right there, isn't that?

1629
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:58,220
Her right there.

1630
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:04,410
Oh my god!

1631
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:05,850
Hi!

1632
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:06,870
Oh, she's back.

1633
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:08,810
That's messed up.

1634
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:15,550
Yes, that's definitely the one.

1635
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:19,330
Maybe you?

1636
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:20,350
You're smiling.

1637
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:23,110
What is it, your real face?

1638
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:25,910
Well, I guess that's kind of like the polite smile, huh?

1639
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:27,290
Oh

1640
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:32,550
my god.

1641
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:35,190
Even when I'm examining, she's coming after me.

1642
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:37,970
Freaky one in bottom right?

1643
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:43,090
Maybe this one.

1644
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:52,810
If I die and die!

1645
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,860
If I die and die!

1646
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,840
I did it!

1647
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,500
It's okay, you don't have to be afraid anymore.

1648
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:06,580
It's a flashcard.

1649
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,110
Is that so?

1650
01:44:12,990 --> 01:44:13,970
Is that true?

1651
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,290
Is that so?

1652
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,990
Oh, that way, okay.

1653
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:22,290
Thank you!

1654
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:24,830
Oh my god.

1655
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:28,110
Thank you so much!

1656
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:29,890
Thank you!

1657
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:33,670
Thank you.

1658
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:34,610
Thank you very much.

1659
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:54,450
Just gotta keep running.

1660
01:44:58,850 --> 01:44:59,990
Oh, there's more of them.

1661
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:10,900
There's more of them.

1662
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,460
Oh, if my game just saved.

1663
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,820
Oh no, my game just saved.

1664
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,960
Can you imagine how I feel?

1665
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,240
What it's like to have been deceived by you for so long.

1666
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:23,220
What does that mean?

1667
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,400
Oh, now it updates.

1668
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:29,180
Okay, okay.

1669
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,940
What it's like to have been deceived by you for so long.

1670
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:39,200
Assyrius.

1671
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,900
I'm going to need you to quit that.

1672
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:51,190
How can I, how am I supposed to tell though, you know?

1673
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:53,650
Stop!

1674
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:54,950
I need to examine!

1675
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,650
Like what kind of face is that?

1676
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:07,520
That guy...

1677
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:12,660
That guy looks kind of upset.

1678
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:15,400
Deceived, huh?

1679
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:20,650
Stop it!

1680
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:25,070
I don't think so.

1681
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:26,170
I don't know, I can't tell.

1682
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:36,110
Synonym to be deceived.

1683
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:39,490
Bamboozled.

1684
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:43,930
I was bamboozled by you for so long.

1685
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:46,010
This guy looks pretty upset.

1686
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:50,110
He's like, actually, he's like full frown.

1687
01:46:53,010 --> 01:46:53,310
Wait.

1688
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:55,690
He's a full frowning guy.

1689
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:59,210
Maybe not angry enough.

1690
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:02,050
Look for the most bamboozled.

1691
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:02,650
one.

1692
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:08,370
That seems a little...

1693
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,580
That guy's happy.

1694
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:17,300
Okay, you're not bamboozled, maybe.

1695
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,620
Gotta be careful, though.

1696
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,600
She's smiling kind of, too.

1697
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,860
I think maybe it's...

1698
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:35,560
He likes the bamboozle.

1699
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:37,840
Oh my gosh.

1700
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:38,180
Oh my gosh.

1701
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:38,440
Please.

1702
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:39,340
Let me move the camera.

1703
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,040
I don't like that even when I'm examining, it moves.

1704
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,060
That freaks me out.

1705
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:49,460
I think it's the guy that was frowning, no?

1706
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:53,820
But also, anyone else hear the occasional footsteps on grass?

1707
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:56,700
It's this guy right there in front of me.

1708
01:47:57,740 --> 01:48:01,300
The one that's like ominously close to the guy on the left.

1709
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,200
It's that.

1710
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:03,940
It's that little guy.

1711
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:08,100
I feel like I would rather be bamboozled than backstabbed.

1712
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:24,020
word I know I hate weeping angel stuff too I really do especially she's not so fast but just fast enough that it freaks me out I

1713
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:41,920
wish I could see this oh my god oh my god see see see I can't even get a chance to look at the face why do

1714
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,260
I feel like it's this guy.

1715
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,860
I don't want to be wrong, though.

1716
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:07,550
You think so, too?

1717
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:09,390
I feel like it's this guy.

1718
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:13,110
He looks upset.

1719
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:14,930
I'm gonna try it.

1720
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:19,110
If I die, I die.

1721
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:20,350
Oh,

1722
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:25,520
holy cow.

1723
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:27,700
Oh, my God.

1724
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,820
Okay, well, it's not him.

1725
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,500
the scarecrow is now, though.

1726
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:49,660
Wait.

1727
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:53,140
I don't know where the scarecrow is now, though, the one following us.

1728
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:55,680
That's pretty bad.

1729
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,080
Maybe it's far away.

1730
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,140
I can't tell.

1731
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:08,340
You know?

1732
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:13,750
Like, she maybe looks shocked.

1733
01:50:16,830 --> 01:50:18,030
Thank God for checkpoints.

1734
01:50:18,170 --> 01:50:18,570
Right!

1735
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:23,670
It could be the fact that, also,

1736
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,240
She...

1737
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:32,680
Well, that one's looking down too, but she's the only one with like backstabbed.

1738
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:34,200
Actually, you know.

1739
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,020
And in the middle.

1740
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,040
What are you, the main character?

1741
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:40,980
Let's try it.

1742
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,860
Oh, hello?

1743
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:48,600
Are you gonna let me do it?

1744
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,800
Oh, the music is killing me.

1745
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:54,820
Let's try her.

1746
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,540
Why won't it let me...

1747
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:00,560
There we go.

1748
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:05,900
That's what I said to you.

1749
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,760
When I saw you so scared.

1750
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,240
That's the way!

1751
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,260
Thank you!

1752
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,570
These are interesting.

1753
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:37,190
More?

1754
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,220
Uh...

1755
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,960
Well, she pointed this way, so I'm just gonna keep on going.

1756
01:51:57,770 --> 01:51:58,610
Keep on going.

1757
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:10,700
Checking for any mysterious figures behind me.

1758
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:12,300
Oh, oh, oh, right here.

1759
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,440
Another.

1760
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:18,620
Another, another, another.

1761
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:22,500
Okay, get him auto-saves, let's go.

1762
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:24,580
Can you even imagine how I feel?

1763
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:27,380
He never once looked at me the way he looked at you.

1764
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:29,220
Not once.

1765
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,740
Okay, that's just you being a little jealous, though.

1766
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,220
It's not our fault, is it?

1767
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:41,540
Wait.

1768
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:47,070
Isn't that our friend?

1769
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:51,610
Sakuko?

1770
01:52:52,490 --> 01:52:53,570
Oh, my bad.

1771
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:54,430
Oh, wait.

1772
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:54,910
What's the journal?

1773
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:55,330
This one.

1774
01:52:55,450 --> 01:52:55,870
There we go.

1775
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,170
But Sakuko is not the one...

1776
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:03,190
Rinko is the one who's interested, no?

1777
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:04,270
In Shu.

1778
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:06,790
Okay.

1779
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:10,810
Maybe we need to find a girl that looks like...

1780
01:53:12,670 --> 01:53:13,150
Dinko.

1781
01:53:13,870 --> 01:53:14,730
She also has...

1782
01:53:14,730 --> 01:53:15,850
Wait, no, she doesn't have Twin Tail.

1783
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,330
I don't remember what Dinko looks like, actually.

1784
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,610
Over there?

1785
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:23,910
Over there?

1786
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,120
It's not the...

1787
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,460
Short-haired girl, so maybe it's her.

1788
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:37,580
Let's try.

1789
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:44,610
Aha!

1790
01:53:44,830 --> 01:53:47,470
I wonder why I called you over.

1791
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:56,960
Thank you.

1792
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:07,100
The music is so scary.

1793
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:08,600
I

1794
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:17,110
thought I heard something moving behind me.

1795
01:54:18,130 --> 01:54:19,290
It's so scary.

1796
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,730
It's so stinking scary.

1797
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:22,970
It's just run.

1798
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:37,880
Um.

1799
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,200
We hit a wall.

1800
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:41,920
Around?

1801
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:46,500
Did you see it?

1802
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:47,300
Did I see what?

1803
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:48,720
Oh gosh, maybe I didn't.

1804
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,660
You missed the bakery?

1805
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,000
What do you mean?

1806
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,080
Here?

1807
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:58,660
Her?

1808
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,600
You missed the cake?

1809
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:08,930
Her?

1810
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,940
Oh, the scarecrow pointing at me.

1811
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:19,860
Oh.

1812
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:20,600
Oh.

1813
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:26,940
I mean, the way her skirt lays is pretty nice, I'll admit.

1814
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:31,800
Oh, it was worth exploring!

1815
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:32,920
Let's go!

1816
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:35,300
I'm not gonna go all the way back for that.

1817
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:38,720
I mean, I would usually, but...

1818
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:42,850
It's okay, guys.

1819
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:44,590
It's okay.

1820
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:46,890
I believe you.

1821
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:57,810
But I'm scared.

1822
01:56:00,670 --> 01:56:01,790
But I'm scared.

1823
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:04,370
I'm scared of cake.

1824
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:13,890
I'm scared of beauty, big, beautiful blushes, booties.

1825
01:56:15,630 --> 01:56:18,110
Am I going the right way?

1826
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,700
Sorry, the music scared me.

1827
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:30,160
Oh, wait.

1828
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:32,080
What's going on?

1829
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,120
Oh.

1830
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:36,800
Why?

1831
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:39,560
No way!

1832
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:40,940
I have to start from the beginning!

1833
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:43,440
Oh, no.

1834
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:43,940
Oh, wait.

1835
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,020
I made it back here.

1836
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:47,120
Guys, look.

1837
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:47,860
I can see it.

1838
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:50,700
Wow-y!

1839
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:57,760
I don't think he not goes very amused.

1840
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,540
You attract what you fear most.

1841
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,300
Oh, no.

1842
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:04,980
Huge cake!

1843
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:06,140
Wait.

1844
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:07,420
She- She-

1845
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:12,320
Okay.

1846
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:15,460
Scary, scary, scary, scary.

1847
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:16,440
I

1848
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,520
am the bakery.

1849
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:24,960
Cuckoo, cuckoo!

1850
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:39,080
It was so I could see...

1851
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,300
Sorry.

1852
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:43,440
Scared the heck out of me.

1853
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,240
Where could the next scarecrow be?

1854
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,000
I can't tell.

1855
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,800
hit the wall and then

1856
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:44,900
follow the wind I am follow the cake the grass blows in the direction if you're lost okay thank you it's actually extremely helpful okay now it's blowing back this way what did I miss okay grass you were literally just opposite direction two seconds ago.

1857
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:54,550
Until you see a group of scarecrows.

1858
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:57,310
Well, I mean, I do hear, but...

1859
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:01,220
Oh.

1860
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:05,920
Uh...

1861
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:07,780
Uh...

1862
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:09,680
I can't see anything now!

1863
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,260
Game!

1864
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:11,980
Please!

1865
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,660
You already know I'm lost!

1866
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:15,860
Why are you doing this to me?

1867
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,300
I think I'm back at cake.

1868
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:27,940
I'm back at cake

1869
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:45,000
Wait, no, I'm not Oh, this is a game It's just like Okay, idiot Okay, stupid Here you go, we'll just send you there

01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:54,000
You know what, that's actually You got close enough I guess, right?

1871
01:59:54,460 --> 02:00:09,840
That's actually quite Kind, probably But you guys saw I followed the wind and then it turned around and then it was just like I don't know Can you even imagine how I feel You've always been such an eyesore

1872
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,100
An eyesore, right?

1873
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:17,880
Do I find the ugly one?

1874
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:20,940
The ugly one

1875
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:35,280
Or do you think it's one that looks Like me?

1876
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:39,000
Do you think we are Oh, whoops.

1877
02:00:39,620 --> 02:00:42,020
Do you think this is like, uh...

1878
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:42,940
What's her name?

1879
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:45,480
Binko's Thoughts.

1880
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:54,890
Oh my god!

1881
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:56,990
Oh my god, she's right there!

1882
02:00:57,070 --> 02:00:58,070
I didn't even hear her.

1883
02:00:59,150 --> 02:00:59,770
Holy cow.

1884
02:01:06,110 --> 02:01:06,470
Ah!

1885
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:08,110
Thank you so much for the Haka Super!

1886
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:08,930
Oh my gosh!

1887
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:10,410
It's my streaming, it makes so many people happy.

1888
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:10,710
Thank you!

1889
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:11,150

1890
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:12,550
Alex, thank you so much!

1891
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:13,110

02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:14,250
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1893
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:25,310
Oh my god.

1894
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:26,010
Oh my god.

1895
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:28,010
Stop it!

1896
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:28,970
Stop it, please!

1897
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:35,590
I'm probably gonna have to lead it away, actually.

1898
02:01:41,110 --> 02:01:41,550
Because...

1899
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:43,590
I can't get close to them.

1900
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,980
Like, MGS3 with all the people you killed?

1901
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:07,670
Oh my gosh, so scary.

1902
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,140
I'm not lost!

1903
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:18,960
I'm trying to get her away from here!

1904
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:20,480
So I can figure out the puzzle!

1905
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,900
I'm not lost.

1906
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:24,660
I know.

1907
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:26,920
I gotta be able to look at these guys.

1908
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:31,880
For some reason, I feel like it's this one, though.

1909
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:39,260
Stop it.

1910
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,780
Stop moving.

1911
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:49,270
Try it.

1912
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,750
I guess if I die, I die.

1913
02:02:57,690 --> 02:02:58,210
Okay.

1914
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:00,110
It was not that one.

1915
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:00,870
Ah!

1916
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:03,210
You're so scary.

1917
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:07,850
Oh my gosh, I can't read your movements at all.

1918
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:09,650
Vibe check failed.

1919
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,900
Me trying to also avoid...

1920
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:20,360
Oh my gosh!

1921
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:39,550
Such an eyesore.

1922
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:56,480
The clue is the one looking at the eyesore.

1923
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,520
She's looking at her, right?

1924
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:09,980
But is she looking at him?

1925
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,240
The look a mean girl gives.

1926
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:16,320
Well, she's also looking at...

1927
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:17,600
Oh, she looks...

1928
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:18,640
She looks evil!

1929
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:19,620
What about you?

1930
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,420
No, she looks normal.

1931
02:04:30,490 --> 02:04:31,770
Let's try it.

1932
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:35,110
Wait, oh, she's looking at the eyesore.

1933
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:37,570
Right?

1934
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:41,230
So the eyesore would be this character over here.

1935
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:42,250
here, right?

1936
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:45,450
Oh!

1937
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,290
Yeah, she looks so sad.

1938
02:04:48,650 --> 02:04:49,070
Oh my god, wait.

1939
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:51,870
The camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera.

1940
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:56,300
I have to turn it.

1941
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:57,700
Oh my god.

1942
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:59,140
Stop, please!

1943
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:00,280
I need to turn the camera!

1944
02:05:05,620 --> 02:05:07,620
The eyesore was your first pick.

1945
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:08,300
Wait.

1946
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:11,300
Wait, I'm actually confused.

1947
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:12,820
Am I not supposed to pick the eyesore?

1948
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:16,520
Oh, she's back even!

1949
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:23,960
you need the one looking at the eyesore

1950
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:32,350
okay okay okay hold on I gotta get her away from here real quick

1951
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:45,730
I wonder what she she's like looking at the creature moving so I wonder what's going through her brain as it's like moving closer towards her

1952
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:59,580
okay we gotta do this fast oh my gosh I'm not fast Okay, there we go.

1953
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,060
I could have just lied to you.

1954
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:04,260
Told you to go any which way.

1955
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:15,700
Oh!

1956
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:18,880
Thank you very much!

1957
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,560
Thank you very much!

1958
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:21,960
Thank you for your time.

1959
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:23,800
Thank you for your time.

1960
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:27,860
Oh yeah, maybe she's like trying to look at the guy.

1961
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:31,680
But the girl is blocking her view.

1962
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:35,900
Drama!

1963
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:40,030
Yeah, we're moonwalking out of here.

1964
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:43,660
Drama, drama, drama.

1965
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:45,000
Thank you.

1966
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,860
Where am I back in the fog?

1967
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:03,080
She's so cute.

1968
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:04,900
Oh, wait, what's happening?

1969
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:10,770
The game took over.

1970
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:12,750
The game was like, no, idiot!

1971
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:20,860
I keep getting lost.

1972
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:22,040
I'm not very good at this.

1973
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,340
You must follow the direction indicated by the finger.

1974
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:33,800
Yeah, I know.

1975
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,180
And that's the way I went.

1976
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:42,680
I'm gonna try and follow the grass more.

1977
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:43,220
Oh.

1978
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:44,700
Wait, I'm stuck.

1979
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:48,780
Oh, I was stuck on a rock.

1980
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:50,280
Oh my gosh, I could have died.

1981
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:01,080
That's so silly.

1982
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:04,480
I was like, oh, the game's taking over again.

1983
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:07,240
That was a lie.

1984
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:16,860
A moonwalking?

1985
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:18,700
Oh.

1986
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:23,420
What is it?

1987
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:25,280
Oh god.

1988
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,160
Take that.

1989
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:27,900
Thank you.

1990
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:30,740
Oh, here we are.

1991
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:31,880
We found it!

1992
02:08:36,350 --> 02:08:39,350
Can you imagine how I feel you hurt me and even hurt him too.

1993
02:08:40,070 --> 02:08:44,750
Do you know how it feels to force a smile when I'm staring at that disgusting face of yours?

1994
02:08:46,610 --> 02:08:48,030
Wait, what are you guys seeing?

1995
02:08:50,450 --> 02:08:54,770
Chat, is it me or does her uniform have a little eye, blep eye face?

1996
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:58,790
You see it!

1997
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:00,690
Wait, that's so cute!

1998
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:04,230
That's so stinking cute.

1999
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:07,670
Well, there's so many this time.

2000
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:20,860
So she's...

2001
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:21,780
I see, yeah.

2002
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:24,680
I see...

2003
02:09:26,490 --> 02:09:27,830
Wait, is there more than one?

2004
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:41,280
There is!

2005
02:09:45,260 --> 02:09:47,240
They kind of, like, have a similar pose.

2006
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:49,360
Like, those two girls are twinning, for real.

2007
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,280
Oh, okay.

2008
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:53,520
I think there's, like, three of them?

2009
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:55,260
At least?

2010
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:57,180
Wait.

2011
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,020
Oh my gosh.

2012
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,320
Wait, this is so difficult.

2013
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:07,720
So it's...

2014
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:15,900
Okay, I have to figure it out really fast!

2015
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:20,200
Okay, um...

2016
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,520
Why do I feel like it's this one?

2017
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:24,160
If I die, I die.

2018
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:29,040
But I feel like it's this one because the smile is like upside down on it, you know?

2019
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,080
Oh my god, please, please, please, please.

2020
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:38,340
the...

2021
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:39,580
Or this one too.

2022
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,580
Damn, these girls got booty.

2023
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:48,780
Do it?

2024
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:49,560
I'll try it.

2025
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:54,340
Like, her face is normal here, but then on the other side, she's smiling.

2026
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:58,500
The mask is smiling, but she's frown, but it's upside down, so it's like she's frowning.

2027
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:00,660
That's my final answer.

2028
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:01,480
Oh my god.

2029
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,000
Oh my god.

2030
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:02,620
Oh my god.

2031
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:03,140
Oh my god.

2032
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:04,940
Stop!

2033
02:11:06,620 --> 02:11:07,460
Stop it!

2034
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:09,740
I think I might die.

2035
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:19,830
I think I watched eight different players in this segment and still don't know how to know the answers or how to figure it out.

2036
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:21,610
I don't think that's a you problem.

2037
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:32,240
I can't get so close.

2038
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:38,450
Here we go.

2039
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:40,470
Oh, this is so bad.

2040
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:46,050
Oh, um, I'm gonna just die.

2041
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:53,030
Kill me!

2042
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:53,650
Kill me!

2043
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:54,230
Kill me!

2044
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,380
I'm not doing two at once.

2045
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,120
That's fine.

2046
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:06,880
Okay.

2047
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:12,610
My logic was flawed.

2048
02:12:15,570 --> 02:12:17,190
My logic was flawed.

2049
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:21,510
But now I can actually see which ones are real.

2050
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:22,850
Which ones are.

2051
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,900
Because of, like, how it's worded, I feel like one...

2052
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:39,020
One side needs to be, like if it's wearing a mask, one side needs to be smiling.

2053
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:40,120
You know what I mean?

2054
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:44,440
Like, it's saying smiling in front of that disgusting face of yours or whatever.

2055
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,620
So I feel like maybe this one.

2056
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:47,920
Hmm.

2057
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:54,860
One moment please.

2058
02:12:56,980 --> 02:12:57,540
There we go.

2059
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:00,460
A forced two-faced smile.

2060
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,820
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

2061
02:13:08,230 --> 02:13:10,170
Let's try this one.

2062
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:23,110
I will see.

2063
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:23,430
I'll see.

2064
02:13:24,910 --> 02:13:25,430
Come

2065
02:13:31,690 --> 02:13:32,650
here, Mrs.

2066
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,260
Okay.

2067
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:42,760
Oh no, my thing is about to break.

2068
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:45,720
Maybe it's the other way around.

2069
02:13:59,710 --> 02:14:01,250
This one's smiling.

2070
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:03,650
Is it you?

2071
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:05,450
Is this your fake smile?

2072
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:13,680
The bit about being hurt matters for this one.

2073
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:16,160
So it's, like, stabbed or something.

2074
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:25,720
I mean, there's this guy, but I feel like it's not...

2075
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:27,880
I feel like it wouldn't be one of the guys, is it?

2076
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:28,860
Or am I crazy?

2077
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:35,240
Are we out the backseat?

2078
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:35,740
Not yet!

2079
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:36,160
I'm not yet.

2080
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:37,000
I'm still trying to figure out.

2081
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:37,700
It's okay.

2082
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:41,160
You hurt me and even hurt him, too.

2083
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:45,320
So maybe it is this guy, then.

2084
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:51,220
backstabbed, but he's smiling at the girl.

2085
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,040
Let's try.

2086
02:14:58,540 --> 02:14:59,800
I'm so bad at this.

2087
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:06,150
Oh, please.

2088
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:07,010
Lock on here, Will.

2089
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:12,560
Oh, my gosh.

2090
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:13,460
So many hits.

2091
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:22,080
So she just says that sometimes.

2092
02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:34,950
I really don't think it's one.

2093
02:15:35,170 --> 02:15:35,910
Maybe it's this one.

2094
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:43,600
I feel like there's no smile, so...

2095
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:47,460
Why not?

2096
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:49,840
Let's just pull all of them at this rate.

2097
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:52,720
Oh my god.

2098
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,800
My weapon's gonna break!

2099
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:12,670
Fruit Force!

2100
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:15,450
I'm not really good at deciphering this one.

2101
02:16:17,710 --> 02:16:18,630
That's like...

2102
02:16:18,630 --> 02:16:20,390
Maybe I'm just like...

2103
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:20,990
What's the word?

2104
02:16:22,870 --> 02:16:23,970
Oh, oh, my weapon's broken.

2105
02:16:30,650 --> 02:16:31,850
Did I get her?

2106
02:16:32,330 --> 02:16:32,950
No, not yet.

2107
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:00,470
The first two weren't so bad.

2108
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:01,970
Or the first couple weren't so bad.

2109
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:05,270
It's this one that is getting me all...

2110
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:06,210
I'll jumble.

2111
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:07,350
The first...

2112
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:10,450
Yeah, I could get the other ones, but this one, I'm like, huh?

2113
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:19,130
And that one, I also thought it was the long-haired girl because she's looking at...

2114
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:50,190
someone else I mean she's not forced to smile you know so I feel like it's probably one like I imagine I was like oh it's probably one that's looking at someone else with a smile you know maybe it's this one where it's upside down again like kind of like oh she's she's smiling because she's upside down but it's actually a frown did I try this one before

2115
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:59,180
Like it's looking at him, so he's looking at her, and she's like, yeah, and she's looking at...

2116
02:17:59,180 --> 02:17:59,820
Did I try this one?

2117
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:00,360
I can't remember.

2118
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:03,700
Every single person I watch play this has struggled a lot.

2119
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:04,080
Don't worry.

2120
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:04,440
Okay.

2121
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,700
Thank you for the reassurance.

2122
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:08,760
Let's try this one.

2123
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:14,680
Okay, but I don't feel like my logic was so flawed there, okay?

2124
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:18,460
I feel like that made total sense.

2125
02:18:32,390 --> 02:18:33,070
Oh, shoot.

2126
02:18:33,210 --> 02:18:33,530
Oh, gosh.

2127
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:33,850
Oh, God.

2128
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:34,210
Oh, God.

2129
02:18:34,370 --> 02:18:34,530
Okay.

2130
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:50,220
I'm using all my stuff, though.

2131
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:51,200
It sucks.

2132
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:57,880
Okay, now I can...

2133
02:18:57,880 --> 02:18:59,940
That was, like, my most logical...

2134
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:00,960
Already!

2135
02:19:01,580 --> 02:19:02,320
No way!

2136
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:03,760
Oh, my gosh.

2137
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:09,020
I feel like that was my most logical explanation.

2138
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:13,460
It was...

2139
02:19:13,460 --> 02:19:13,580
Alright.

2140
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:14,140
Oh!

2141
02:19:18,810 --> 02:19:19,610
Oh, my.

2142
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:20,770
Oh my god!

2143
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:26,210
Evil, evil, evil, evil!

2144
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:36,340
Wait, why did I do that?

2145
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:37,680
All my stamina.

2146
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:51,220
I feel like that was my most logical.

2147
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,820
Girl with the knife in the back near the boy with the knife in the back.

2148
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:57,180
I did her!

2149
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:04,600
I've done so many of these guys at this point.

2150
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:09,420
Her?

2151
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:11,320
This one?

2152
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,020
Wait, didn't I do this?

2153
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,280
Maybe I didn't do this one.

2154
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:20,580
I guess...

2155
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:21,960
Let me see if I did it or not.

2156
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:24,560
Oh my god.

2157
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:26,680
It happens all the time.

2158
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:29,020
A kid falling to their death in the waterway.

2159
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:37,960
I don't even feel good about that.

2160
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:38,900
Finding it out.

2161
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:39,760
Because it was so confusing.

2162
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:46,080
Oh

2163
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:49,800
my god.

2164
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:51,800
Oh,

2165
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:08,780
there's shoe over there.

2166
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:10,100
I see him.

2167
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:11,380
Wait, there's shoe right there.

2168
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:12,800
Wait, but I see...

2169
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:14,540
I see shoe over there.

2170
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:15,780
Wait, why do I see...

2171
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:20,140
Wait, why do I see double shoe?

2172
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:26,660
Wait, is it supposed to be like that or is it bugs?

2173
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:35,560
Well, shoes right there!

2174
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:39,020
A pair of shoes.

2175
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:44,920
One whole year in Minto, today is my birthday.

2176
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:46,660
I'm going to spend it the same way I did last year.

2177
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,560
Ah, happy birthday!

2178
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:50,620
Happy, happy birthday!

2179
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,780
Happy birthday to you.

2180
02:21:57,600 --> 02:21:59,860
Happy birthday to you.

2181
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:02,020
Happy birthday, dear.

2182
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:04,100
I see a light.

2183
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:06,200
I hope I said your name right.

2184
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:09,480
Happy birthday to you.

2185
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:11,260
Happy birthday.

2186
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,000
Guys, why do we have double shoes?

2187
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:16,980
Two shoes.

2188
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:19,560
Oh, look at it.

2189
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:20,400
Hinako.

2190
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:23,520
Rinako?

2191
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:30,950
A pair of shoes.

2192
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:55,800
She like so clearly is so...

2193
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:57,520
But, there's no one else.

2194
02:22:58,060 --> 02:22:59,640
I see no one else's bad old girl.

2195
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,860
I'm like, this is absolutely weird.

2196
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,000
There's no one else.

2197
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,600
There's so many bad creatures that are all around the world.

2198
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:07,540
I don't know what to do with it.

2199
02:23:15,490 --> 02:23:17,270
Yeah, real subtle wrinkle.

2200
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:25,230
You got any steel pipes in there?

2201
02:23:30,430 --> 02:23:33,330
You got any pipes that we can borrow, wrinkle?

2202
02:23:44,860 --> 02:23:45,660
Oh,

2203
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:52,260
the doll is right there.

2204
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:52,840
Why?

2205
02:24:00,740 --> 02:24:02,880
But everyone's disappeared.

2206
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:03,800
But everyone's disappeared.

2207
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:26,540
You guys can swim, right?

2208
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,240
Oh my god.

2209
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:36,680
Again, you guys can swim, right?

2210
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,680
That's actually not even that bad of like a swim.

2211
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:57,180
Oh no.

2212
02:24:58,440 --> 02:24:58,940
Oh no.

2213
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:02,760
Yes, please.

2214
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:03,500
Please.

2215
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:07,600
Okay, thank you.

2216
02:25:08,980 --> 02:25:27,720
I don't know why they're so scared of the water.

2217
02:25:29,360 --> 02:25:33,900
Just go push you down the stairs, girl.

2218
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:36,080
evil!

2219
02:25:37,320 --> 02:25:37,320
Hello!

2220
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:57,330
And Shu probably didn't hear a dang thing.

2221
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:04,640
Gosh!

2222
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:12,080
Scarecrow's whispers, as you bask in the sun, I sink into the shadows is what the achievement I just got.

2223
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:13,180
Basking.

2224
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:17,440
We're back here with our sexy fox guy.

2225
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,540
Yeah, we didn't see a push.

2226
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:30,440
I thought that too.

2227
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:33,320
But...

2228
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:33,460
Oh.

2229
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:35,640
I'm lagging hard, sorry.

2230
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,480
Creepy fox, man.

2231
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:43,540
Why am I lagging so bad?

2232
02:26:52,220 --> 02:26:54,960
Aw, we were supposed to get bandages and stuff from her.

2233
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:55,420
No!

2234
02:26:56,540 --> 02:26:58,040
No, our supply run!

2235
02:26:58,840 --> 02:26:59,880
Aw, man.

2236
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:04,610
Evil.

2237
02:27:06,090 --> 02:27:07,810
Why does this board look like a trap?

2238
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:11,230
Hello!

2239
02:27:12,650 --> 02:27:14,990
I hope there's no board really scary guys in here.

2240
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:16,050
Those are so scary.

2241
02:27:17,330 --> 02:27:19,050
Oh, there's someone over there.

2242
02:27:27,490 --> 02:27:28,610
Is that him?

2243
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:30,090
Oh, of course he does.

2244
02:27:33,150 --> 02:27:37,030
Of course, of course he shuts the door on us.

2245
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:37,610
Of course.

2246
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:42,530
Oh, it's giving me a lot of things to do and I'm...

2247
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:43,330
I'm not reading them.

2248
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:44,170
Oops.

2249
02:27:45,590 --> 02:27:46,530
What's over here?

2250
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:53,340
A whole lot of nothing.

2251
02:27:57,480 --> 02:27:59,360
He closed the door on my face.

2252
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:00,640
He's into me.

2253
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:03,600
Scale of 1 to 10, how spooky is this game?

2254
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:04,940
I think it's pretty spooky.

2255
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,640
I like it.

2256
02:28:14,390 --> 02:28:15,930
So far, so calm.

2257
02:28:21,150 --> 02:28:21,870
Uh-huh.

2258
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:23,210
Okay.

2259
02:28:23,610 --> 02:28:24,990
Yeah, I like the atmosphere.

2260
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,410
a lot.

2261
02:28:26,370 --> 02:28:34,510
It's like my favorite kind of atmosphere, basically, for, like, scary things, so I'm really... That's why I'm so scared because I'm so into it.

2262
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:37,490
Let's not...

2263
02:28:39,310 --> 02:28:41,110
It's about to say, what's in here?

2264
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:51,100
It's like a storage area.

2265
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:54,240
I think the stuff... The crash came from over here, I think.

2266
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:55,460
Oh my gosh.

2267
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:55,800
Camera.

2268
02:28:57,700 --> 02:28:58,380
Maybe not.

2269
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:06,400
Oh, It is letting me go inside though.

2270
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:08,800
For what purpose?

2271
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:12,220
Huh.

2272
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:14,440
Anything I can take?

2273
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:15,440
Open?

2274
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:15,760
Ah.

2275
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:18,520
Messy scrolls.

2276
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:24,000
Wonder what that pretty little thing's chirps will sound like when I tear off that mask of hers.

2277
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:27,180
The girl before last was an exquisite specimen.

2278
02:29:27,660 --> 02:29:30,100
I can barely contain myself every time I think about her.

2279
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:32,360
I told you he's into me!

2280
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:36,940
Oh no.

2281
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:45,960
Anybody out there?

2282
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:46,320
No?

2283
02:29:47,640 --> 02:29:47,640
Okay.

2284
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:50,460
What was that?

2285
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:01,760
What the way is that?

2286
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,540
Thank you for the divine water, I guess.

2287
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:07,580
And nothing else.

2288
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:21,560
So scared.

2289
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:32,500
We'll go, uh...

2290
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:33,320
Oh, there's more.

2291
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:34,900
Wait, this place is huge!

2292
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:38,440
We'll go this way since the sounds are...

2293
02:30:39,400 --> 02:30:40,560
That's what I'm doing!

2294
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:43,200
Since the sounds are...

2295
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:44,240
Who?

2296
02:30:51,390 --> 02:30:53,240
Oh my gosh, the camera angles really...

2297
02:30:53,990 --> 02:30:54,830
Wait, was this a door?

2298
02:30:55,450 --> 02:30:56,070
Did I miss it?

2299
02:30:57,110 --> 02:30:57,590
Oh, okay.

2300
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:04,520
Find the... Okay, the sacred door.

2301
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:06,200
This place is humongous!

2302
02:31:06,880 --> 02:31:07,340
Okay.

2303
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:11,480
Oh,

2304
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:15,300
okay, hold on.

2305
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:17,380
I feel a little lost.

2306
02:31:17,620 --> 02:31:18,700
Okay, we gotta go this way.

2307
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:21,640
There's another room even.

2308
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:23,700
Wait, I thought we were outside.

2309
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:24,760
Suddenly we're inside.

2310
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:28,880
What's going on here?

2311
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:31,580
What's the puzzle?

2312
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:34,460
Oh, no, there's like little artifacts.

2313
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:36,700
I have to remember these artifacts.

2314
02:31:41,210 --> 02:31:41,690
Okay.

2315
02:31:44,690 --> 02:31:45,970
What's in there?

2316
02:31:46,150 --> 02:31:46,450
Nothing.

2317
02:31:47,410 --> 02:31:48,570
Can't even open this.

2318
02:31:49,850 --> 02:31:50,150
Okay.

2319
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:50,450
Oh.

2320
02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:51,410
No.

2321
02:31:52,190 --> 02:31:53,210
I'm a little stressed.

2322
02:31:55,370 --> 02:31:56,670
I'm a little stressed.

2323
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:00,450
Nothing.

2324
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:02,910
Wait, can I leave?

2325
02:32:03,010 --> 02:32:04,690
I don't want to be inside here.

2326
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:15,450
Yeah, why will you let me open two drawers and they both have nothing in them?

2327
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:18,430
It's pretty rude.

2328
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:21,390
Ah.

2329
02:32:22,730 --> 02:32:23,570
I should have.

2330
02:32:23,690 --> 02:32:25,530
I should have expected it.

2331
02:32:28,730 --> 02:32:29,350
Yeah, yeah.

2332
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:31,550
Yeah, yeah.

2333
02:32:32,050 --> 02:32:33,610
Save was right back that way.

2334
02:32:33,710 --> 02:32:34,210
Oh, was it?

2335
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:35,290
Thank you so much.

2336
02:32:35,930 --> 02:32:37,010
Where I was headed to?

2337
02:32:37,450 --> 02:32:40,210
Well, it's kind of forcing me in that direction anyway, so.

2338
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:46,340
We'll go through here.

2339
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:57,440
room key ah oh my game just saved

2340
02:33:06,670 --> 02:33:23,400
we're praying we're praying i use so many with the supplies in the foggy area oh wait this is silent hill it's all foggy Howdy, howdy!

2341
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:23,980
Welcome back!

2342
02:33:24,300 --> 02:33:24,620
Thank you!

2343
02:33:24,940 --> 02:33:25,740
For one whole month!

2344
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:26,540
Thank you, thank you!

2345
02:33:28,220 --> 02:33:30,720
Um... But... I mean, the scarecrow area?

2346
02:33:31,580 --> 02:33:34,220
I almost wanted to, like, restart, but...

2347
02:33:34,220 --> 02:33:34,500
Wait.

2348
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:39,160
Oh, yeah, what is that?

2349
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:40,920
It's like a big ol...

2350
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:42,540
Okay.

2351
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:44,420
Cool.

2352
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:50,240
Hmm.

2353
02:33:53,260 --> 02:33:53,680
Naginato.

2354
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:54,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it's called.

2355
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,230
Yeah, yeah.

2356
02:33:58,440 --> 02:33:58,900
I don't...

2357
02:33:58,900 --> 02:33:59,760
I didn't remember.

2358
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:06,780
I don't...

2359
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:08,800
I'm not good at remembering things like that.

2360
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:13,600
Okay, then let's go back to the storage room.

2361
02:34:19,490 --> 02:34:20,880
Let's go over here.

2362
02:34:22,890 --> 02:34:24,430
Explore just a tad.

2363
02:34:28,830 --> 02:34:31,250
Just a smidge of exploration.

2364
02:34:32,210 --> 02:34:32,330
Exploration.

2365
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:36,910
I was, there was like a scrape on the, what's it called?

2366
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:40,670
The pole and I was wondering if it was a claw mark.

2367
02:34:41,330 --> 02:34:41,790
Scary.

2368
02:35:01,390 --> 02:35:02,350
Fucking not.

2369
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,320
What is that sound?

2370
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:13,320
Okay, let's try that door.

2371
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:15,840
I'm guessing.

2372
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:17,480
Oh, it's highlighted.

2373
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:19,760
Wait, does that mean that that's where the key goes?

2374
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:22,320
I don't want to know what's over here anyway.

2375
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:26,140
Just the wind.

2376
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:29,100
Just the wind, of course.

2377
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:32,440
Of course, of course, of course.

2378
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:32,900
Of course.

2379
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,540
This looks awfully suspicious.

2380
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:38,080
Like a great place to hide, huh?

2381
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:44,740
Okay.

2382
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:50,500
Moinari-sama's emblem.

2383
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:54,590
Mmm.

2384
02:35:54,930 --> 02:35:55,350
Minto.

2385
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:56,710
That's me.

2386
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:00,290
Okay, so I go back this way.

2387
02:36:01,490 --> 02:36:03,930
This place is going to get me all backwards.

2388
02:36:04,270 --> 02:36:06,970
Sorry, I'm going to be, like, opening up the map every two seconds, I fear.

2389
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:22,660
I'm not a fan of what we might be releasing.

2390
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:34,800
We weren't in here before, were we?

2391
02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:42,990
Oh, my doll!

2392
02:36:46,030 --> 02:36:47,670
Gonna have nightmares with this area?

2393
02:36:50,330 --> 02:36:52,570
The doll that we don't know to trust or not.

2394
02:36:57,230 --> 02:36:59,650
She's looking right at me.

2395
02:37:04,750 --> 02:37:06,210
If there was something there, I missed it.

2396
02:37:08,970 --> 02:37:09,090
Oh.

2397
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:15,880
Yeah, it's saying to don't trust the fox guy.

2398
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:18,560
Don't believe the fox's words!

2399
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:20,880
Stay away from the western room.

2400
02:37:23,580 --> 02:37:24,620
Who's Ember?

2401
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:28,740
Oh.

2402
02:37:28,760 --> 02:38:01,570
my gosh yesterday i carried up i uh had to carry a big package i didn't realize that it was gonna be so heavy i had to carry it for a long time and now my arms are jelly a warning kinako is mine her fingers her lips every last drop of blood that can be squeezed from her is mine i forbid anyone from laying so much as a finger on her i shall say it until my throat is is raw.

2403
02:38:02,070 --> 02:38:04,010
Hinako is mine.

2404
02:38:05,450 --> 02:38:07,470
I told you he wants me.

2405
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:09,450
I told you.

2406
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:11,330
Wait, so who do we believe, though?

2407
02:38:11,650 --> 02:38:12,790
Our childhood doll?

2408
02:38:13,230 --> 02:38:16,310
Or the guy that's kind of been helping us?

2409
02:38:20,510 --> 02:38:21,010
Probably.

2410
02:38:21,870 --> 02:38:23,070
Maybe not the guy anymore.

2411
02:38:27,130 --> 02:38:27,850
Um, guys.

2412
02:38:28,110 --> 02:38:29,170
I think he likes us.

2413
02:38:33,700 --> 02:38:35,360
What is West again?

2414
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:41,120
I don't remember.

2415
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:42,620
Is it Nishi?

2416
02:38:42,980 --> 02:38:43,120
Wait.

2417
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:44,420
Am I stupid?

2418
02:38:50,510 --> 02:38:52,330
In Japanese, sorry.

2419
02:38:56,990 --> 02:38:58,210
It is Nishi.

2420
02:38:58,450 --> 02:38:59,050
Okay, okay, okay.

2421
02:39:03,210 --> 02:39:04,130
It's a dame!

2422
02:39:05,470 --> 02:39:07,890
Whoa, look at the mask there.

2423
02:39:08,030 --> 02:39:08,410
Cool.

2424
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:09,690
A little freak.

2425
02:39:10,670 --> 02:39:12,650
Hinako, you're so in.

2426
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:15,710
Yeah, Hinako, you have nothing to be worried about.

2427
02:39:15,790 --> 02:39:17,750
He's obsessed with you.

2428
02:39:20,250 --> 02:39:22,710
Well, now I'm not quite sure where to go.

2429
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:27,570
Ah, I see, I see.

2430
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:36,380
Now...

2431
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:37,620
Wait, West.

2432
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:40,120
So this is the West Room.

2433
02:39:40,940 --> 02:39:41,900
That's what she's saying.

2434
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:43,400
I believe then.

2435
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:48,720
I don't think there was anything in here.

2436
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:50,820
I feel like I combed it pretty well.

2437
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:05,960
You heard the doll.

2438
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:06,700
Don't go.

2439
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,320
What do you mean time to choose?

2440
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:20,700
Do I have another choice?

2441
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:24,260
I don't think I have a choice, do I?

2442
02:40:25,220 --> 02:40:27,220
The game says go.

2443
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:31,900
What does the fox say?

2444
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:41,180
I'm going to the West Room.

2445
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:43,700
I'm so sorry I'm a curious cat.

2446
02:40:44,220 --> 02:40:46,020
If you are a fox.

2447
02:40:47,780 --> 02:40:50,340
Oh, I thought that was like fan art.

2448
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:57,120
Oh, what could that be possibly blocking on the other side?

2449
02:40:57,580 --> 02:41:01,160
What could possibly be lurking over there?

2450
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:06,920
Is this his room?

2451
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:08,080
Wait a second.

2452
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:14,260
Is this like stages of Hinako?

2453
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:24,640
Mysterious.

2454
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:26,460
They all have no faces.

2455
02:41:29,560 --> 02:41:31,540
This one just totally doesn't have a head.

2456
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:33,900
That's my favorite, actually.

2457
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:37,060
I'm in your room!

2458
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:38,540
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fox!

2459
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:47,400
It's once again telling me not to believe him, not to trust him.

2460
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:49,520
But hold on, before I...

2461
02:41:50,440 --> 02:41:51,440
Before I activate...

2462
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:52,940
Oh, maybe...

2463
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:54,660
Actually, maybe that will activate it.

2464
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,060
Don't trust him!

2465
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:05,280
So cute!

2466
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:07,780
Yeah, I might have a thing for headless women.

2467
02:42:08,420 --> 02:43:11,000
it's like kind of like Dolahan and also oh my gosh wait have you guys seen that figure series of like invisible girls I don't know the brand off of the top of my head but they often do like it'll be like a seifuku and like the skirt will be blowing up but because the girl is invisible you can't see anything oh my gosh it's so good oh it's so good and then there's like hold on you haven't seen it okay hold on hold on this is important enough for me to pause the game real quick one second one second i've been wanting these figures for so long now it's really cleverly made they look so so good oh but if i could just remember what the ah what the you know the modeler like this the company They just put out something new recently and I was looking at it.

2468
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:12,360
Hold on, let me go through my history.

2469
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:14,820
My...

2470
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:17,520
Ami-Ami-Ami history.

2471
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:21,600
Okay, it wasn't recent enough, I suppose.

2472
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:25,880
Heroism?

2473
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:26,860
I don't think...

2474
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:27,820
I'm not sure.

2475
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:28,500
Hold on.

2476
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:29,780
Let me look up like Seifuku.

2477
02:43:31,720 --> 02:43:34,000
That'll probably give me like the most stuff ever.

2478
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:35,200
Oh, it does.

2479
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:36,800
Sailor Fuku.

2480
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,020
Saylor, Fuku.

2481
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:42,700
This is important.

2482
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,500
You guys, I'm showing you.

2483
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:45,740
I'm showing you peak.

2484
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:46,700
Okay?

2485
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:47,780
It's so good.

2486
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:48,560
I promise.

2487
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:49,720
It's worth it.

2488
02:43:50,660 --> 02:43:52,160
It is Heroism Studio.

2489
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:52,740
It is.

2490
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:02,860
It's not showing me if I look it up.

2491
02:44:03,980 --> 02:44:05,220
It's not showing me.

2492
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:12,580
Wait, I think also recently they did a ghost one, you know, kind of like how I am me and Mama did that ghost of me and the shit.

2493
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:13,320
Ah, ha!

2494
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:13,960
I found it.

2495
02:44:15,060 --> 02:44:18,560
I found the ghost, but this one, wait, is this the same brand?

2496
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:19,860
Yes.

2497
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:21,080
Yes, yes, yes.

2498
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:22,880
But this one, she's not invisible.

2499
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:23,380
Hold on.

2500
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:24,340
Okay, I found some of them.

2501
02:44:24,420 --> 02:44:25,940
They're so good, you guys.

2502
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:27,960
They're so good.

Oh, that's okay.

02:45:22,580 --> 02:45:24,540
It's so stinking sexy.

2523
02:46:44,920 --> 02:46:47,660
This is what I mean when I say less is more.

2524
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:51,640
Like, you can show so little and it, like, is so sexy, you know?

2525
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:53,020
Like, this?

2526
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:55,120
It's so sexy.

2527
02:46:56,100 --> 02:46:57,120
Oh, they're so good.

2528
02:46:57,860 --> 02:46:59,040
They're so good!

2529
02:46:59,740 --> 02:47:00,460
Okay, anyway.

2530
02:47:02,020 --> 02:47:03,260
I'll go back to the game now.

2531
02:47:04,180 --> 02:47:05,380
I'm a little less scared.

2532
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:09,320
I'm a little less scared.

2533
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:17,540
It's not that I'm shilling Ami Ami, but I only mention Ami Ami so often because they're the only site that I use.

2534
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,440
So, okay.

2535
02:47:21,800 --> 02:47:22,100
Hmm.

2536
02:47:22,820 --> 02:47:23,340
Back to game.

2537
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:26,960
We're going to take whatever the heck this thing is.

2538
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:30,160
Inari sculpture.

2539
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:32,660
A sculpture in the image of the god Inari.

2540
02:47:33,260 --> 02:47:35,040
It looks like it might fit somewhere.

2541
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:38,340
We saw a room.

2542
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:59,960
that had uh what's it called oh was it this one I'm scared something's gonna come after me once I walk out of here okay yeah the emblem room exactly exactly

2543
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:14,880
oh no oh it just gives me a full full no way okay Interesting.

2544
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:16,300
I didn't see anything.

2545
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:22,140
I guess maybe we go back to that one place with the long sword.

2546
02:48:28,250 --> 02:48:30,590
Spooky, spooky, spooky, spooky, spooky, spooky.

2547
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:32,610
Spooky, spooky, spooky.

2548
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:36,270
My hands are so sweaty.

2549
02:48:37,890 --> 02:48:39,750
If I were scared...

2550
02:48:40,850 --> 02:48:41,330
And...

2551
02:48:43,850 --> 02:48:45,990
If I were scared...

2552
02:48:45,990 --> 02:48:47,190
I'm playing this game.

2553
02:48:49,010 --> 02:48:50,910
But just still, let me hold your hand.

2554
02:48:51,450 --> 02:48:52,730
If I'm so scared.

2555
02:48:54,570 --> 02:48:55,790
Even though my hands are sweaty.

2556
02:48:56,450 --> 02:48:57,390
Which is, does that mean?

2557
02:48:57,850 --> 02:48:58,210
Still?

2558
02:48:58,410 --> 02:48:59,490
Wait, am I lost?

2559
02:49:00,350 --> 02:49:00,670
Yes.

2560
02:49:01,010 --> 02:49:01,190
No.

2561
02:49:01,470 --> 02:49:02,150
I'm not lost.

2562
02:49:07,530 --> 02:49:10,310
I might get your hand covered in ectoplasm.

2563
02:49:10,770 --> 02:49:11,650
Is that okay?

2564
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:16,720
Scared.

2565
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:30,360
Okay, not here.

2566
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:36,340
Um...

2567
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:37,580
Huh.

2568
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:41,500
Mom spaghetti.

2569
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:42,580
Yeah, exactly.

2570
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:46,300
What did I miss?

2571
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,700
Where was a spot where I could...

2572
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:00,040
Place it.

2573
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:03,420
Wait, did I go this way?

2574
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:06,680
Oh, I didn't!

2575
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:08,660
Oh my gosh, I didn't even go this way.

2576
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:09,860
I'm so silly.

2577
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:16,440
What does a Yohkan do again?

2578
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:20,580
Some good merch shilling.

2579
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:24,880
If only there was a recent min-merch that said- Oh yeah, I have merch!

2580
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:29,000
I wish there was a link showing me where to get a min-merch!

2581
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:29,780
Yeah!

2582
02:50:30,940 --> 02:50:32,200
I'll have to link it.

2583
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:35,040
Okay, greatly restores health, okay, I'll remember that.

2584
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:38,000
I have merch!

2585
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:39,240
Sorry, I forgot.

2586
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,580
Don't tell Shatana, Shatana.

2587
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:48,560
There are valuable relics hidden away in an old storage room.

2588
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:50,140
They must be kept under lock and key.

2589
02:50:50,320 --> 02:50:52,020
The last girl slipped in while I wasn't looking.

2590
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:54,200
It took a long time to find her.

2591
02:50:58,120 --> 02:50:59,820
That's not... that couldn't be this room, right?

2592
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:01,820
That wouldn't be this.

2593
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:03,740
Oh, I think he goes there!

2594
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:06,140
Investigate the strange object.

2595
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:06,880
Okay.

2596
02:51:07,880 --> 02:51:08,440
Thanks, Kim.

2597
02:51:13,190 --> 02:51:15,770
Now, Hara, does this open up or something?

2598
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:20,470
Cute!

2599
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:22,650
Oh, this opens up.

2600
02:51:25,530 --> 02:51:26,830
Yeah, what other girl?

2601
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:27,970
I thought you were into me.

2602
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:35,060
The game saved, so...

2603
02:51:35,060 --> 02:51:39,060
Grab that.

2604
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:51,020
An exquisitely crafted ornamental pole armor.

2605
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:54,400
that is extremely sturdy and able to be used as a weapon.

2606
02:51:57,160 --> 02:51:57,560
KURNA!

2607
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:58,780
Oh my god.

2608
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:03,700
Oh, I didn't mean to attack, but it's a good thing I did.

2609
02:52:04,540 --> 02:52:05,720
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2610
02:52:06,740 --> 02:52:07,940
What are you doing in here?

2611
02:52:10,300 --> 02:52:13,300
ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2612
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:19,530
Is this the other girl, maybe?

2613
02:52:24,370 --> 02:52:25,070
Oh, oopsie.

2614
02:52:25,070 --> 02:52:27,550
I got ahead of myself.

2615
02:52:31,810 --> 02:52:33,010
New weapon acquired.

2616
02:52:33,250 --> 02:52:34,930
Can I have my thing back please?

2617
02:52:35,010 --> 02:52:35,710
Thank you.

2618
02:52:35,990 --> 02:52:37,490
The fire's gone out.

2619
02:52:38,270 --> 02:52:38,970
Aw, man.

2620
02:52:40,730 --> 02:52:41,110
Okay.

2621
02:52:47,930 --> 02:52:48,970
Is this the X?

2622
02:52:49,730 --> 02:52:49,730
Yeah.

2623
02:52:50,890 --> 02:52:51,250
Oh.

2624
02:52:52,310 --> 02:52:52,690
Whoa.

2625
02:52:53,450 --> 02:52:53,830
Freaky.

2626
02:52:58,270 --> 02:52:58,990
This...

2627
02:52:58,990 --> 02:53:01,490
I think this is an important thing.

2628
02:53:03,190 --> 02:53:05,810
Sorry, I'm going to go.

2629
02:53:08,810 --> 02:53:09,610
Tattered paper.

2630
02:53:10,170 --> 02:53:15,870
The inscription on the pole arm reads, Also known as Inadama.

2631
02:53:16,350 --> 02:53:18,990
Inadama is another way for Inazuma, meaning lightning.

2632
02:53:19,570 --> 02:53:22,410
This likely refers to the unique pattern of the blade's steel.

2633
02:53:26,670 --> 02:53:27,950
To the door!

2634
02:53:29,210 --> 02:53:30,210
Here we go!

2635
02:53:32,470 --> 02:53:34,590
Oh, this looks so ominous!

2636
02:53:35,990 --> 02:53:37,970
Wait, there's a save right here too!

2637
02:53:38,490 --> 02:53:39,830
Okay, cool!

2638
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:44,540
What do you mean here we go?

2639
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:46,620
What do you mean by that?

2640
02:53:47,180 --> 02:53:48,020
What do you mean by that?

2641
02:53:55,020 --> 02:53:56,360
So it is a boss.

2642
02:53:57,840 --> 02:53:58,620
Not a feeling.

2643
02:54:06,050 --> 02:54:07,830
We finally arrived.

2644
02:54:08,830 --> 02:54:09,750
What's over here?

2645
02:54:10,410 --> 02:54:11,050
One moment, please.

2646
02:54:11,530 --> 02:54:12,190
I'm investigating.

2647
02:54:14,710 --> 02:54:15,550
Is she hard?

2648
02:54:16,590 --> 02:54:17,130
The boss?

2649
02:54:25,770 --> 02:54:27,790
I forgot to investigate the door, actually.

2650
02:54:32,190 --> 02:54:33,530
Saku goes in the afterlife.

2651
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:39,640
Something's supposed to go here too.

2652
02:54:41,080 --> 02:54:42,160
Oh yeah, he's got something.

2653
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:44,800
This key is the same one as before.

2654
02:54:50,560 --> 02:54:51,280
Yeah,

2655
02:54:55,260 --> 02:55:03,880
I'm totally gonna lower my caution, my defenses when my dead friend is calling out to me with a creepy, ghastly echo.

2656
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:12,160
That's like me being like, hey, wisps, come over here.

2657
02:55:15,740 --> 02:55:52,100
to be afraid of just follow the sound of my voice okay wow it's so beautiful reminds me of tangled i'm gonna cry oh oh my gosh seriously okay let's go ram actually there might be another one on the other side let's take care of this thing oh never mind she left

2658
02:55:57,500 --> 02:56:08,220
what was the sneak attack it was like a full focus and then oh my god the way she's running seems suspicious ask if she has 500 yen to pay you back right

2659
02:56:19,440 --> 02:56:21,500
okay hold on i am gonna go around the other way then

2660
02:56:24,900 --> 02:56:32,060
focus and when they shake red attack No, I think that's the counter, right?

2661
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:36,260
I'm talking about the sneak attack that I failed last time, too.

2662
02:56:36,780 --> 02:56:37,220
That's okay.

2663
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:38,720
You can't win them all.

2664
02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:42,860
Is she gonna notice me?

2665
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:51,660
Yeah, she's a little stupid.

2666
02:56:54,060 --> 02:56:54,960
There is a sneak attack.

2667
02:56:55,100 --> 02:56:56,420
There was a whole tutorial for it.

2668
02:56:57,620 --> 02:56:58,120
Uh-oh.

2669
02:56:58,400 --> 02:56:58,520
Wait.

2670
02:56:59,480 --> 02:56:59,860
Uh-oh.

2671
02:57:00,500 --> 02:57:00,980
Oh!

2672
02:57:17,550 --> 02:57:18,030
Ouch!

2673
02:57:18,090 --> 02:57:19,170
Oh, nice.

2674
02:57:31,950 --> 02:57:32,790
Took care of her.

2675
02:57:34,250 --> 02:57:36,810
It's not a sneak attack, just a focus attack that deals heavy damage.

2676
02:57:37,150 --> 02:57:37,570
Oh, okay, okay.

2677
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:44,580
Oh, yeah, the journal had a tutorial, huh?

2678
02:57:45,580 --> 02:57:46,720
Maybe it was just a...

2679
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:48,040
Maybe I thought it was a sneak attack.

2680
02:57:49,740 --> 02:57:50,540
Stamina, sanity...

2681
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:51,340
Oh, yeah, here we go.

2682
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:55,120
It's like to use of focus and psychological attacks from enemies.

2683
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:56,660
I'm not in a state of focus.

2684
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:58,440
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2685
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:01,360
stamina is dealing with my focus.

2686
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:03,580
Taking psychological damage.

2687
02:58:06,300 --> 02:58:09,180
Once you have no sanity left, your health will take damage instead.

2688
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:12,580
Dodging.

2689
02:58:13,400 --> 02:58:14,000
Fleeing.

2690
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:15,920
Yeah, I do that a lot.

2691
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:18,320
Attacks.

2692
02:58:19,060 --> 02:58:19,480
Focus.

2693
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:22,780
Hmm.

2694
02:58:24,720 --> 02:58:27,180
Use RB to perform the focus attack.

2695
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:27,960
That might have been it.

2696
02:58:29,140 --> 02:58:29,740
Okay.

2697
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:37,880
Anyway, not quite sure if these guys recover or not yet, so I don't want to hang her.

2698
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,420
I don't want to linger, you know?

2699
02:58:41,980 --> 02:58:43,140
She was kind of messy.

2700
02:58:43,340 --> 02:58:43,800
It's so funny.

2701
02:58:43,960 --> 02:58:45,440
There's, like, ink all over in here.

2702
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:49,680
She looked like a...

2703
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:50,860
Like a...

2704
02:58:51,940 --> 02:58:54,420
Barbie doll that's been played by a kid.

2705
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:57,220
Greatly decreases focus charging time.

2706
02:58:57,880 --> 02:58:58,440
Thank you.

2707
02:58:58,780 --> 02:58:59,080
Okay.

2708
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:00,580
Any bandages?

2709
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:02,840
Any health items?

2710
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:03,160
Okay.

2711
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:04,420
That's fine.

2712
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:05,660
That's fine too.

2713
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:10,340
Oh.

2714
02:59:11,440 --> 02:59:12,520
Divine water.

2715
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:16,860
Okay, that part is blocked off.

2716
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:17,860
I could tell from here.

2717
02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:20,160
I just wanted to make sure.

2718
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:21,900
Saku-ko!

2719
02:59:22,840 --> 02:59:23,840
Saku-ko!

2720
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:25,200
Aww.

2721
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:28,040
You're not- you're not, Saku-ko!

2722
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:41,540
Oh, shoot.

2723
02:59:41,640 --> 02:59:42,220
I did the wrong thing.

2724
02:59:52,760 --> 02:59:53,520
Okay.

2725
02:59:58,680 --> 02:59:59,720
That was pretty smooth.

2726
03:00:01,400 --> 03:00:02,420
I like this weapon.

2727
03:00:03,720 --> 03:00:05,700
I hope I get to keep it forever.

2728
03:00:18,250 --> 03:00:18,950
Yes.

2729
03:00:20,310 --> 03:00:22,270
Slip on in there.

2730
03:00:28,130 --> 03:00:28,890
Oh.

2731
03:00:30,010 --> 03:00:31,130
Oh, okay!

2732
03:00:31,370 --> 03:00:32,050
This is fine.

2733
03:00:36,210 --> 03:00:37,210
This is fine.

2734
03:00:42,250 --> 03:00:42,650
Um...

2735
03:00:43,430 --> 03:00:44,230
Housemaid's note!

2736
03:00:45,770 --> 03:00:46,170
Made...

2737
03:00:46,170 --> 03:00:47,350
February 15th.

2738
03:00:47,410 --> 03:00:49,250
There can be no two ways about it.

2739
03:00:49,330 --> 03:00:50,890
The family is indeed cursed.

2740
03:00:53,090 --> 03:00:54,110
Wait, hold on, maybe.

2741
03:00:58,840 --> 03:01:01,100
And I am the only one who knows the full story.

2742
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:05,420
I must tell the master all I know, for if I do not, the curse will certainly befall me as well.

2743
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:07,260
May the gods have mercy on me.

2744
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:43,680
the lighting is like so strong in some of these areas i could feel like i would see like a shadow of one of them walking by or something like that you know very spooky scary amy physicians log february 1st symptoms at onset are as following as follows headache fever vertigo chills vomiting diarrhea at first i believe signs pointed to a seasonal cold however after prescribing medicine symptoms did not improve in fact they worsened Me!

2745
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:44,600
That's me!

2746
03:01:48,220 --> 03:01:49,560
Yeah, I'm pretty cursed.

2747
03:01:50,480 --> 03:01:52,220
For those who don't know.

2748
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:54,160
Like, actually.

2749
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:58,020
I mean, it's pretty cursed already that I'm dead, no?

2750
03:01:58,380 --> 03:02:01,420
The Crimson Spring... Spring gushing from the womb.

2751
03:02:02,040 --> 03:02:04,280
Deep within is the Shimizu family.

2752
03:02:09,420 --> 03:02:09,840
How?

2753
03:02:11,140 --> 03:02:11,680
Wait, what?

2754
03:02:12,180 --> 03:02:14,420
The Crimson Spring gushing from the womb?

2755
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:30,020
What was that?

2756
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:31,620
Was that the sound of the thing we're covering?

2757
03:02:35,080 --> 03:02:37,620
Like the monster outside?

2758
03:02:45,470 --> 03:02:47,950
Sorry, I'm moving the camera around like crazy right now.

2759
03:02:48,170 --> 03:02:49,230
So sorry, so sorry.

2760
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:52,490
I just realized I was doing it.

2761
03:02:52,650 --> 03:02:54,210
Like in such an erratic way.

2762
03:02:55,250 --> 03:02:57,250
I'm just like exploring everything.

2763
03:03:00,110 --> 03:03:01,590
I did miss one.

2764
03:03:09,100 --> 03:03:10,040
I missed one.

2765
03:03:11,140 --> 03:03:11,420
Oh, here.

2766
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:12,980
Not enough.

2767
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,580
The honorable blood fill it up.

2768
03:03:14,820 --> 03:03:15,340
Make it full.

2769
03:03:15,740 --> 03:03:15,960
Otherwise.

2770
03:03:21,010 --> 03:03:22,490
Did I miss another note?

2771
03:03:23,450 --> 03:03:24,130
Maybe over here.

2772
03:03:32,320 --> 03:03:33,200
Ah, wait.

2773
03:03:33,500 --> 03:03:34,120
Oh, I got this.

2774
03:03:36,740 --> 03:04:08,100
okay we continue on board I think that's it okay on the floor what do you mean on the floor on the right wait what I missed it oh thank you family physicians log February 8th the patients condition are conditions are declining suddenly and rapidly symptoms are as follows labored breathing

quadriplegia.

2776
03:04:13,420 --> 03:04:14,020
What is that?

2777
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:17,840
You've convinced me I bought one of the invisible girls you should.

2778
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:19,600
Oh, it's so good.

2779
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:21,280
I don't have one.

2780
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:25,300
I should get one, but yeah.

2781
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:27,220
I hope it, I hope it.

2782
03:04:27,340 --> 03:04:28,220
Tell me how it is.

2783
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:29,440
Oh, paralysis.

2784
03:04:30,280 --> 03:04:33,960
Involuntary movements, in addition to these, an even stranger's symptom has arisen.

2785
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:37,320
The patient's facial features appear to be deforming.

2786
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:54,780
The patient's faces remain stuck in expressions of constant strain their teeth bared their eyes narrowed into a menacing glare freaky what is it olivander's one one shot is the one chop in the

2787
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:05,180
my did my game just save

2788
03:05:12,080 --> 03:05:13,600
Come here, come here.

2789
03:05:20,440 --> 03:05:21,620
Sakuko, don't run away.

2790
03:05:23,360 --> 03:05:24,640
Don't run away from me, Sakuko.

2791
03:05:26,340 --> 03:05:27,340
She'll be afraid of me.

2792
03:05:28,760 --> 03:05:28,880
Maybe.

2793
03:05:29,560 --> 03:05:30,100
I'm scared.

2794
03:05:35,490 --> 03:05:38,530
I knew there was no way Sakuko could be gone, though, you know, like.

2795
03:05:41,410 --> 03:05:43,130
I just didn't expect it right now.

2796
03:05:50,470 --> 03:05:51,870
I'm checking my corners.

2797
03:05:57,960 --> 03:06:05,820
Research notes on Enmye Jugonoku Or is it Sakuko at all?

2798
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:34,480
The wish to have one's romantic desires fulfilled is as old as humanity itself Consequently, there have existed many arts by which people attempt to make such dreams come true One such method was to employ a sorcerer Known as a Jugonji to perform an incantation written in the Enmi Jujugon Roku After such spells were suspected of causing chaos and turmoil in the imperial court,

2799
03:06:34,860 --> 03:07:18,500
their practice was expressly forbidden under the Yoro Code in the first year of the Tempio Hoji era 757 AD Magic Riz That's just a love potion guys Oh my gosh However, these incantations were later adopted into the practice of Omniodo, where their effects continue to be studied according to multiple sources powerful and romantic spells have been successfully cast that have been successfully cast are often accompanied by the scent of sandalwood yummy it sounds sounds good wait so like if i got like so that like sandalwood candle i got wait do i have to run all the way back here once i have the thing dried carcass

2800
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:24,320
Yeah.

2801
03:07:25,140 --> 03:07:28,380
Wait, I have to run all the way back here to get to the door.

2802
03:07:30,620 --> 03:07:33,160
An animal carcass that has been properly packaged as an offering.

2803
03:07:33,440 --> 03:07:34,780
It gives off a vague odor.

2804
03:07:37,240 --> 03:07:38,420
Oh, no!

2805
03:07:40,640 --> 03:07:41,600
Okay, hold on.

2806
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:02,200
I hear her.

2807
03:08:06,670 --> 03:08:07,310
I hear them.

2808
03:08:13,490 --> 03:08:15,570
Find out where the voice is coming from.

2809
03:08:17,790 --> 03:08:20,250
They put Fami Tiki in the game!

2810
03:08:24,740 --> 03:08:27,800
I was trying to figure out which direction it's in, but...

2811
03:08:28,580 --> 03:08:29,920
It sounds right next to me.

2812
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:31,100
Maybe to my left?

2813
03:08:35,920 --> 03:08:36,740
Nope, to my right.

2814
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:40,640
Just kidding!

2815
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:41,320
Oh my god!

2816
03:08:41,960 --> 03:08:43,100
I was right the first time.

2817
03:08:47,580 --> 03:08:47,980
Ah!

2818
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:48,860
Oh my gosh!

2819
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:49,200
No!

2820
03:08:49,700 --> 03:08:50,560
I got grabbed!

2821
03:08:53,100 --> 03:08:54,240
Ah, that sucks.

2822
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,360
Oh, that sucks.

2823
03:09:06,680 --> 03:09:08,540
I tried to do the special attack.

2824
03:09:09,780 --> 03:09:11,640
And I was not very good at it.

2825
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:17,980
I should have... I don't know why I didn't wait for them to glow red, but whatever.

2826
03:09:19,380 --> 03:09:19,740
Oh well.

2827
03:09:20,720 --> 03:09:21,880
Yeah, go onwards.

2828
03:09:21,880 --> 03:09:25,360
I hear another one.

2829
03:09:33,410 --> 03:09:34,590
This is insanity.

2830
03:09:35,150 --> 03:09:36,930
Am I going to have to go through all of this again?

2831
03:09:37,750 --> 03:09:39,170
All the way back here?

2832
03:09:40,970 --> 03:09:41,410
Okay.

2833
03:09:41,770 --> 03:09:42,130
Oh, God.

2834
03:09:42,250 --> 03:09:42,610
Hold on.

2835
03:09:42,710 --> 03:09:44,670
I'm, like, remembering the route a little bit.

2836
03:09:44,790 --> 03:09:45,710
So we go through the library.

2837
03:09:49,350 --> 03:09:50,530
Jose Horror Game?

2838
03:09:51,470 --> 03:09:52,450
What do you mean by that?

2839
03:09:55,190 --> 03:09:56,250
Oh, there's two of them.

2840
03:09:59,630 --> 03:10:01,230
I heard another one.

2841
03:10:05,140 --> 03:10:06,240
Just use fast travel.

2842
03:10:06,720 --> 03:10:06,960
Yeah!

2843
03:10:07,380 --> 03:10:07,820
Forehand.

2844
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:16,760
I heard...

2845
03:10:16,760 --> 03:10:19,640
Did it

2846
03:10:23,410 --> 03:10:24,070
go onward?

2847
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:30,160
Ah.

2848
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:31,620
Ah.

2849
03:10:33,940 --> 03:10:35,460
Dead end.

2850
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:35,820
Okay.

2851
03:10:36,180 --> 03:10:36,340
Ah.

2852
03:10:38,060 --> 03:10:39,000
Okay, I go...

2853
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,280
Okay, I came from here.

2854
03:10:41,720 --> 03:10:44,340
And so I go here and around.

2855
03:10:50,510 --> 03:10:51,230
What are you?

2856
03:10:52,250 --> 03:10:52,690
Lakazuti.

2857
03:10:54,290 --> 03:10:57,290
Slowly restore his health and current max sanity for a set time.

2858
03:10:57,470 --> 03:10:58,970
Also, we can be used as an offering.

2859
03:11:01,090 --> 03:11:01,530
I

2860
03:11:10,380 --> 03:11:13,280
think I should hold on to what I have for now.

2861
03:11:14,120 --> 03:11:14,920
Maybe there was only...

2862
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:16,640
I could have sworn I heard too.

2863
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:18,100
Oh gosh, it's coming back.

2864
03:11:23,430 --> 03:11:23,870
So...

2865
03:11:26,970 --> 03:11:33,190
scary oh i don't think it comes this way maybe it does oh no it doesn't

2866
03:11:39,260 --> 03:11:41,340

2869
03:12:26,980 --> 03:12:30,260
I couldn't dodge, it was still... my stamina was still loading.

2870
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:31,660
That's okay, that's okay.

2871
03:12:39,390 --> 03:12:40,650
Oh, okay, we're here, we're here.

2872
03:12:40,710 --> 03:12:40,910
Where?

2873
03:12:44,660 --> 03:12:48,420
Oh, I didn't notice him walking in the back before!

2874
03:12:48,700 --> 03:12:49,680
That's so freaky.

2875
03:12:50,100 --> 03:12:52,080
See, it's stuff like that that I really, really love.

2876
03:12:52,220 --> 03:12:54,120
Just little tiny details where...

2877
03:12:54,120 --> 03:12:55,180
You would never know!

2878
03:12:56,780 --> 03:12:57,900
You would never know.

2879
03:12:58,920 --> 03:12:59,720
Um, wait.

2880
03:13:01,720 --> 03:13:03,820
I think it was just this guy here.

2881
03:13:09,430 --> 03:13:11,550
But I also know that it's to my left this time.

2882
03:13:17,890 --> 03:13:21,790
I'm gonna go to the little ghosty's room real fast.

2883
03:13:24,430 --> 03:13:30,350
I'm gonna go to the little ghosty's room real right quick and I will be right back and then we will continue.

2884
03:13:30,630 --> 03:13:33,910
I want to get... you guys think I will be able to beat the boss today.

2885
03:13:36,730 --> 03:13:42,800

2888
03:16:32,010 --> 03:16:33,250
Oh, thank you for that.

2889
03:16:33,430 --> 03:16:34,530
Let's open the egg and die well.

2890
03:16:34,650 --> 03:16:35,310
Thank you.

2891
03:16:37,690 --> 03:16:38,170
Okay.

2892
03:16:39,650 --> 03:16:44,690
Now that I know that there's two for sure, I was not so sure before.

2893
03:16:44,890 --> 03:16:45,530
Now I'm sure.

2894
03:16:46,570 --> 03:16:47,370
I'm sure.

2895
03:16:50,270 --> 03:16:51,230
Oh, wow.

2896
03:16:52,410 --> 03:16:53,250
Okay, dokie.

2897
03:16:54,050 --> 03:16:54,890
Let's do this.

2898
03:16:59,980 --> 03:17:00,460
Oh.

2899
03:17:00,800 --> 03:17:01,740
And I grabbed the chicken.

2900
03:17:07,080 --> 03:17:08,460
I should have trusted my ears.

2901
03:17:09,960 --> 03:17:11,000
I knew it was to my left.

2902
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:14,140
I should have trusted my ears.

2903
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:19,020
Oh gosh, wait.

2904
03:17:41,510 --> 03:17:44,210
It really sucks that there's no way to like get out of that.

2905
03:17:45,010 --> 03:17:45,890
Oh, it really sucks.

2906
03:17:53,530 --> 03:17:54,290
Oh well.

2907
03:17:55,610 --> 03:17:56,010
Oh well.

2908
03:17:57,690 --> 03:17:59,850
So much crazy damage.

2909
03:18:00,970 --> 03:18:07,090
Alright, so what we need to do is definitely take on one at a time.

2910
03:18:09,630 --> 03:18:11,210
So we'll take out this guy first.

2911
03:18:14,110 --> 03:18:15,290
Grabs are meant to be punishing.

2912
03:18:15,450 --> 03:18:17,190
It sucks, it sucks, it sucks.

2913
03:18:17,910 --> 03:18:18,550
How much damage?

2914
03:18:18,630 --> 03:18:19,530
It doesn't have higher difficulty?

2915
03:18:19,710 --> 03:18:20,170
I'm afraid.

2916
03:18:20,970 --> 03:18:22,050
I'm afraid they don't even know.

2917
03:18:28,390 --> 03:18:30,450
I don't know where the other one comes from, though.

2918
03:18:31,390 --> 03:18:33,870
Like, I know there's too, but where does she come from?

2919
03:18:34,490 --> 03:18:34,810
You know?

2920
03:18:36,010 --> 03:18:36,510
Ah,

2921
03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:43,860
indeed.

2922
03:18:46,040 --> 03:18:46,700
Ah, indeed.

2923
03:18:52,720 --> 03:18:54,280
Oh my gosh, I'm trapped!

2924
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:55,740
Ah!

2925
03:18:56,100 --> 03:18:57,960
Oh my gosh, I couldn't get out.

2926
03:18:58,740 --> 03:18:59,880
I didn't realize I was against the...

2927
03:19:10,260 --> 03:19:11,400
There we go.

2928
03:19:11,540 --> 03:19:11,740
Okay.

2929
03:19:12,540 --> 03:19:13,960
There's one down at least.

2930
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:14,540
Oh.

2931
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:17,960
Wait, do I need the Trigger her being like, Let's go!

2932
03:19:19,240 --> 03:19:20,240
I'm not gonna care.

2933
03:19:21,540 --> 03:19:21,720
Okay.

2934
03:19:23,020 --> 03:19:23,460
Let's...

2935
03:19:23,460 --> 03:19:24,000
Let's go.

2936
03:19:27,530 --> 03:19:29,650
I don't know where the other one comes from.

2937
03:19:32,650 --> 03:19:33,790
Oh, from the ceiling.

2938
03:19:33,950 --> 03:19:34,330
That's why.

2939
03:19:38,740 --> 03:19:39,380
Oh, gosh.

2940
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:39,660
Okay.

2941
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:41,380
I don't think we can run from her, can we?

2942
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:44,840
Oh, my God.

2943
03:19:46,560 --> 03:19:47,420
Oh, I'm so screwed.

2944
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:48,080
Wait.

2945
03:19:48,280 --> 03:19:49,060
I screwed myself.

2946
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:50,460
Oh, I screwed myself!

2947
03:19:51,340 --> 03:19:52,440
I screwed myself!

2948
03:19:53,960 --> 03:19:54,180
Ah!

2949
03:19:58,400 --> 03:19:59,740
I have no stamina!

2950
03:20:08,090 --> 03:20:09,290
Which is so bad.

2951
03:20:09,630 --> 03:20:10,990
Guys, guys, uh, I'm screwed.

2952
03:20:17,710 --> 03:20:18,550
Oh my god.

2953
03:20:19,530 --> 03:20:20,410
Okay, you can't run.

2954
03:20:20,730 --> 03:20:22,570
The game is like, sometimes you gotta run!

2955
03:20:25,230 --> 03:20:26,870
It lies to you!

2956
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:41,640
That wasn't so good.

2957
03:20:42,500 --> 03:20:43,820
That was pretty bad, actually.

2958
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:45,860
It's really bad.

2959
03:20:48,200 --> 03:20:48,960
That was a...

2960
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:49,920
Okay, don't run.

2961
03:20:52,060 --> 03:20:53,420
Why is it gotta be empty?

2962
03:20:55,560 --> 03:20:57,420
Sometimes I hear like something that sounds like laughing.

2963
03:20:57,620 --> 03:20:58,820
It's pretty...

2964
03:20:58,820 --> 03:20:59,740
You hear it?

2965
03:20:59,820 --> 03:21:00,960
I don't know if you can...

2966
03:21:00,960 --> 03:21:02,940
It's too soft on your eyes, isn't it?

2967
03:21:04,840 --> 03:21:05,820
It's like a...

2968
03:21:07,220 --> 03:21:09,160
Oh, how nice.

2969
03:21:10,720 --> 03:21:12,700
Wait, I can offer...

2970
03:21:13,400 --> 03:21:13,660
You.

2971
03:21:18,700 --> 03:21:19,140
Yahoo!

2972
03:21:21,340 --> 03:21:22,220
Oh, we're...

2973
03:21:22,220 --> 03:21:23,780
Wait, how much was it to upgrade?

2974
03:21:25,280 --> 03:21:25,720
500.

2975
03:21:26,180 --> 03:21:29,460
We can either get a new Omamori, or we can...

2976
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:30,140
Upgrade.

2977
03:21:30,480 --> 03:21:32,260
I think upgrading is more important right now.

2978
03:21:33,820 --> 03:21:34,260
Yawkan.

2979
03:21:34,700 --> 03:21:35,160
Oh, cool.

2980
03:21:35,760 --> 03:21:36,800
I just had to use one.

2981
03:21:38,560 --> 03:21:39,380
Divine Water.

2982
03:21:40,740 --> 03:21:41,680
Okay, what do we have?

2983
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:43,280
What's my supplies at the moment?

2984
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:45,520
Upgrades are good?

2985
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:46,340
Yeah, yeah.

2986
03:21:46,360 --> 03:21:47,480
I'm thinking that.

2987
03:21:48,300 --> 03:21:52,660
Honestly, I feel like my own my body... I mean, oh, I only have one slot.

2988
03:21:52,860 --> 03:21:53,400
It kind of sucks.

2989
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:54,700
Max stamina.

2990
03:21:57,260 --> 03:21:58,260
Max health.

2991
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:01,280
Decrease focus charging time.

2992
03:22:02,640 --> 03:22:03,900
Decrease enemy line of sight.

2993
03:22:04,420 --> 03:22:06,840
It greatly decreases the damage taken while dodging.

2994
03:22:09,860 --> 03:22:10,360
Hey, y'all, y'all.

2995
03:22:11,160 --> 03:22:11,500
Hey, y'all.

2996
03:22:12,220 --> 03:22:14,340
I wanted to ask this on a Silent Hill F-stream.

2997
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:16,200
Pick a favorite prefecture.

2998
03:22:16,360 --> 03:23:14,220
Should have gotten a letter And two or three digit number If it's too much to add Much, it's okay Um I think I understand what you're doing Okay, let's see Um Maybe a favorite prefecture I can I see And then Should have gotten a letter Hmm Hmm you for you day and then two or three digit number well we can't do four fours because you said two or three uh wait oh ah three ten for minto three ten minto you can use focus to time the counter

2999
03:23:18,220 --> 03:23:19,720
It's a skill issue.

3000
03:23:24,900 --> 03:23:26,560
What am I hearing laughing though?

3001
03:23:32,860 --> 03:23:34,440
Okay, I'm not running.

3002
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:36,140
I'm not running at all anymore.

3003
03:23:37,220 --> 03:23:38,440
I'm taking my damn sweet time.

3004
03:23:46,380 --> 03:23:46,900
Okay.

3005
03:24:01,610 --> 03:24:02,830
Did my game just save?

3006
03:24:02,930 --> 03:24:03,670
Is that what I just saw?

3007
03:24:10,710 --> 03:24:11,670
Stone orb.

3008
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:17,150
This seems to be made from the same material as the stone key that the moss...

3009
03:24:17,150 --> 03:24:18,190
The moss...

3010
03:24:25,820 --> 03:24:27,920
Appalachians saying things wrong.

3011
03:24:32,340 --> 03:24:34,320
Fox mask had given to me.

3012
03:24:34,420 --> 03:24:36,180
Maybe it serves a similar purpose.

3013
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:40,980
Oh, oh, big, big change in atmosphere.

3014
03:24:43,800 --> 03:24:44,320
What was that?

3015
03:24:52,560 --> 03:24:54,260
Girl, if it were me, I'd just be booked.

3016
03:24:55,300 --> 03:24:57,280
Oh my god!

3017
03:25:07,470 --> 03:25:07,770
Wait,

3018
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:30,240
am I going the right way?

3019
03:25:30,980 --> 03:25:31,280
Sorry.

3020
03:25:39,440 --> 03:25:40,640
Wait, uh...

3021
03:25:41,460 --> 03:25:42,060
Uh...

3022
03:25:42,060 --> 03:25:44,000
Yes, I need to go...

3023
03:25:45,220 --> 03:25:46,000
Okay, okay.

3024
03:25:46,460 --> 03:25:46,720
Sorry.

3025
03:25:54,810 --> 03:25:56,250
Wait, uh, sorry.

3026
03:25:56,950 --> 03:25:58,130
Okay, to the left.

3027
03:26:00,090 --> 03:26:01,190
Ah, okay.

3028
03:26:01,430 --> 03:26:01,950
I should have known.

3029
03:26:04,490 --> 03:26:07,230
We're running, we're running, we're running.

3030
03:26:07,390 --> 03:26:09,590
We're running, we're running.

3031
03:26:14,320 --> 03:26:14,760
We're running.

3032
03:26:17,200 --> 03:26:18,180
Wait, hold on.

3033
03:26:19,400 --> 03:26:20,040
Okay, okay, okay.

3034
03:26:22,760 --> 03:26:23,200
Uh...

3035
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:25,280
I'm gonna name that doll thing.

3036
03:26:25,880 --> 03:26:26,280
Junior.

3037
03:26:26,840 --> 03:26:28,540
No, why would you do that?

3038
03:26:29,080 --> 03:26:29,260
Okay.

3039
03:26:30,400 --> 03:26:31,060
Um, okay.

3040
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:37,260
It doesn't, I guess we could go around if we totally need to, but I don't want to.

3041
03:26:48,330 --> 03:26:49,650
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3042
03:26:50,510 --> 03:26:51,790
I'm dodging, I'm dodging.

3043
03:26:52,710 --> 03:26:54,430
Oh gosh, I'm dodging, and I'm running, and I'm running.

3044
03:27:12,470 --> 03:27:13,470
Okay, whoo!

3045
03:27:14,770 --> 03:27:16,190
Yay, we did it!

3046
03:27:16,290 --> 03:27:17,110
That wasn't so bad.

3047
03:27:17,870 --> 03:27:19,450
I feel like the other guys were way scarier.

3048
03:27:21,430 --> 03:27:22,350
Way more.

3049
03:27:23,930 --> 03:27:25,630
Okay, we did it!

3050
03:27:26,990 --> 03:27:29,370
Can we go back to Asana Hill now?

3051
03:27:32,630 --> 03:27:33,830
Find Fox Mask.

3052
03:27:33,930 --> 03:27:34,670
Okay, we don't.

3053
03:27:36,310 --> 03:27:37,310
Okay, understandable.

3054
03:27:38,310 --> 03:27:39,990
Oh yeah, I didn't read these yet.

3055
03:27:40,450 --> 03:27:41,250
at least.

3056
03:27:41,810 --> 03:27:43,670
A monster that pretends to be a scarecrow.

3057
03:27:43,810 --> 03:27:46,950
It's dressed in old clothes and looks like a crucified corpse from far away.

3058
03:27:47,370 --> 03:27:51,690
Contrary to its name, it scares more kids off than crows.

3059
03:27:53,810 --> 03:27:54,890
What did I miss?

3060
03:27:56,790 --> 03:27:57,970
Oh, I guess that's it.

3061
03:27:59,770 --> 03:27:59,990
Baby.

3062
03:28:00,610 --> 03:28:03,390
Oh, a monster that possesses sharp blades for legs.

3063
03:28:04,550 --> 03:28:05,070
Sexy.

3064
03:28:05,710 --> 03:28:09,570
Does someone sever both of its legs and replace them with such disturbing things?

3065
03:28:10,330 --> 03:28:10,730
anywhere?

3066
03:28:11,270 --> 03:28:14,210
Or was this creature brought into existence just so it could end up like this?

3067
03:28:16,190 --> 03:28:20,510
I'm blocking it, but there's like cute little tiny doodles in the corners as well.

3068
03:28:21,470 --> 03:28:22,370
I'm blocking it.

3069
03:28:22,530 --> 03:28:24,150
You can kind of see it when I flip the page.

3070
03:28:24,310 --> 03:28:28,710
A bizarre monster that looks like a bunch of celluloid dolls intertwined.

3071
03:28:29,050 --> 03:28:31,910
Each of these dolls was most likely some child's best friend.

3072
03:28:32,230 --> 03:28:34,550
To think that they would appear like this in my nightmare.

3073
03:28:36,990 --> 03:28:37,730
What do we got here?

3074
03:28:39,350 --> 03:28:40,430
Less hand mirror.

3075
03:28:40,450 --> 03:28:44,130
when taking fatal damage from normal attacks this mirror will break instead.

3076
03:28:44,550 --> 03:28:46,730
Health, sanity, and stamina will be fully restored.

3077
03:28:49,110 --> 03:28:49,770
Oh no.

3078
03:28:50,550 --> 03:28:51,690
What's my health like at anyway?

3079
03:28:52,890 --> 03:28:54,450
Take that bandage for sure.

3080
03:28:57,310 --> 03:28:58,830
Wait, why is it giving me so much stuff?

3081
03:29:00,230 --> 03:29:01,150
Wait a second.

3082
03:29:02,570 --> 03:29:04,110
Wait, there's like a ton of stuff here.

3083
03:29:04,930 --> 03:29:05,130
Wait.

3084
03:29:06,790 --> 03:29:07,030
Wait.

3085
03:29:09,670 --> 03:29:10,150
Uh-oh.

3086
03:29:10,450 --> 03:29:11,170
Wait!

3087
03:29:12,930 --> 03:29:13,310
Uh-oh.

3088
03:29:14,590 --> 03:29:15,470
Uh-oh.

3089
03:29:15,830 --> 03:29:18,070
I should probably start saving over these.

3090
03:29:18,870 --> 03:29:19,490
Okay!

3091
03:29:20,070 --> 03:29:20,950
Uh-oh.

3092
03:29:21,550 --> 03:29:22,430
Uh-oh.

3093
03:29:22,630 --> 03:29:23,350
Uh-oh.

3094
03:29:23,350 --> 03:29:26,310
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

3095
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:29,960
Freaky.

3096
03:29:32,220 --> 03:29:32,840
Um...

3097
03:29:33,920 --> 03:29:35,560
What was the thing that I...

3098
03:29:35,560 --> 03:29:36,780
Oh, it was another first...

3099
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:38,940
It hit kit?

3100
03:29:40,920 --> 03:29:41,900
I believe?

3101
03:29:56,230 --> 03:29:57,810
Let's get rid of a divine water.

3102
03:30:02,060 --> 03:30:03,560
And then we can upgrade.

3103
03:30:04,120 --> 03:30:04,340
Maybe.

3104
03:30:05,620 --> 03:30:06,460
Yes, we can.

3105
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:09,020
Let's get rid of a divine water.

3106
03:30:10,960 --> 03:30:11,720
And the Yohkan!

3107
03:30:12,620 --> 03:30:14,440
I'll keep, because I think I'll use it.

3108
03:30:15,020 --> 03:30:16,040
This restores stamina.

3109
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:20,420
Let's just get rid of this, and then we can upgrade.

3110
03:30:22,180 --> 03:30:27,620
But what should I upgrade is the biggest thing.

3111
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:31,700
My health, my sanity, stamina.

3112
03:30:32,060 --> 03:30:34,280
I can't do all my body shots just yet, but.

3113
03:30:38,020 --> 03:30:38,460
Stamina.

3114
03:30:38,660 --> 03:30:42,540
I think, honestly, stamina for dodging is, like, huge.

3115
03:30:45,560 --> 03:30:46,740
Stamina screwed you last time.

3116
03:30:46,840 --> 03:30:48,260
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

3117
03:30:49,020 --> 03:30:51,160
So I think stamina will be the way that I go.

3118
03:30:51,280 --> 03:30:53,720
Your prayers were heard, you now have more stamina!

3119
03:30:54,580 --> 03:30:55,100
Yippee!

3120
03:30:56,620 --> 03:30:57,920
What are we looking at?

3121
03:31:00,560 --> 03:31:01,080
Okay.

3122
03:31:02,260 --> 03:31:03,780
Alright, all my health is here.

3123
03:31:05,700 --> 03:31:10,720
Oh wow, I didn't even realize that the thing I'm using doesn't even have durability.

3124
03:31:11,120 --> 03:31:12,040
That's really nice.

3125
03:31:13,740 --> 03:31:16,900
And then the big first aid kit is here if I need it.

3126
03:31:17,240 --> 03:31:18,900
Alright, I'm gonna save one more time.

3127
03:31:22,780 --> 03:31:23,300
Okay.

3128
03:31:23,320 --> 03:31:23,960
Naginata.

3129
03:31:24,500 --> 03:31:24,900
Naginata.

3130
03:31:25,160 --> 03:31:26,200
I never remember the name.

3131
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:27,860
Can I take this now?

3132
03:31:28,380 --> 03:31:28,780
Dang.

3133
03:31:29,380 --> 03:31:30,560
Only one at a time.

3134
03:31:31,140 --> 03:31:31,540
No!

3135
03:31:38,850 --> 03:31:41,050
If you donate one more divine water, you can fit that.

3136
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:41,630
Can I?

3137
03:31:42,290 --> 03:31:43,030
Will it stack?

3138
03:31:57,590 --> 03:31:58,790
Nice, thank you.

3139
03:31:59,430 --> 03:32:02,670
What does the divine- sorry, I can't remember what these items do at all for some reason.

3140
03:32:03,570 --> 03:32:04,450
Okay, that's the sanity.

3141
03:32:05,450 --> 03:32:05,450
Okay.

3142
03:32:09,130 --> 03:32:09,750
this one.

3143
03:32:10,630 --> 03:32:12,070
Oh, another first aid kit.

3144
03:32:13,990 --> 03:32:14,810
Uh-oh.

3145
03:32:15,530 --> 03:32:17,270
What are they trying to say, huh?

3146
03:32:19,330 --> 03:32:20,610
Oh, gosh.

3147
03:32:29,730 --> 03:32:31,030
Goodbye, other divine water.

3148
03:32:37,970 --> 03:32:40,430
Oh, I can't.

3149
03:32:40,510 --> 03:32:42,410
Oh, because the divine water was stacked.

3150
03:32:42,930 --> 03:32:43,110
Ah!

3151
03:32:46,930 --> 03:32:47,830
What do?

3152
03:32:49,130 --> 03:32:50,630
It needs its own slot.

3153
03:32:52,730 --> 03:32:53,470
It's fine.

3154
03:32:54,150 --> 03:32:54,370
Maybe.

3155
03:32:55,810 --> 03:32:56,830
I don't think it's fine.

3156
03:32:59,030 --> 03:33:00,610
What if I got rid of my peels?

3157
03:33:02,950 --> 03:33:04,090
Probably good with only two.

3158
03:33:04,250 --> 03:33:05,910
Let's try if I die.

3159
03:33:07,010 --> 03:33:08,370
I just restart.

3160
03:33:08,610 --> 03:33:09,170
I just retry.

3161
03:33:09,630 --> 03:33:10,030
It's all good.

3162
03:33:14,760 --> 03:33:16,040
Use one then grab it.

3163
03:33:16,180 --> 03:33:17,340
People are saying sell it all.

3164
03:33:17,540 --> 03:33:17,980
Why?

3165
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:19,740
Why do you want me to have no items?

3166
03:33:20,460 --> 03:33:21,660
Why do you want me to have nothing?

3167
03:33:21,680 --> 03:33:23,620
I need health!

3168
03:33:26,100 --> 03:33:27,280
Why do you want me to die?

3169
03:33:27,500 --> 03:33:29,620
I guess I could sell all the divine water.

3170
03:33:30,560 --> 03:33:32,160
I don't think I'll use it, honestly.

3171
03:33:32,940 --> 03:33:33,620
Do that.

3172
03:33:37,940 --> 03:33:39,100
Just don't get hit.

3173
03:33:39,200 --> 03:33:40,020
Yeah, forehead.

3174
03:33:40,720 --> 03:33:41,400
Alright, RB.

3175
03:33:41,900 --> 03:33:42,560
And it's Y.

3176
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:43,840
Okay.

3177
03:33:50,010 --> 03:33:53,950
Is that him?

3178
03:33:57,490 --> 03:33:58,490
No, I don't think so.

3179
03:34:01,990 --> 03:34:02,070
I

3180
03:34:15,920 --> 03:34:16,640
don't...

3181
03:34:17,960 --> 03:34:18,380
Oh!

3182
03:34:25,070 --> 03:34:27,970
Oh, that's some big old mighty...

3183
03:34:27,970 --> 03:34:28,630
Those are like...

3184
03:34:28,630 --> 03:34:29,010
Oh, I was...

3185
03:34:29,630 --> 03:34:30,470
Her tears.

3186
03:34:31,190 --> 03:34:31,350
Ooh.

3187
03:34:32,250 --> 03:34:32,830
Oh, girl.

3188
03:34:38,120 --> 03:34:39,260
I was right!

3189
03:34:44,200 --> 03:34:45,480
Oh, I don't like that.

3190
03:34:45,600 --> 03:34:46,980
Oh, that's got some length on it.

3191
03:34:47,060 --> 03:34:47,360
Uh-oh.

3192
03:35:01,540 --> 03:35:02,940
Oh

3193
03:35:06,800 --> 03:35:08,900
my god.

3194
03:35:09,860 --> 03:35:10,340
Oh my god.

3195
03:35:12,820 --> 03:35:14,500
Sakuko like entity.

3196
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:20,700
Oh shoot.

3197
03:35:30,270 --> 03:35:31,470
Oh my gosh!

3198
03:35:31,930 --> 03:35:32,610
Oh my gosh!

3199
03:35:38,240 --> 03:35:38,460
Ah!

3200
03:35:45,880 --> 03:35:46,760
Holy cow!

3201
03:35:46,920 --> 03:35:48,160
She hits like crazy!

3202
03:35:48,380 --> 03:35:50,160
Okay, I'm gonna have to start healing for real.

3203
03:35:52,740 --> 03:35:53,180
Golly!

3204
03:35:53,320 --> 03:35:53,800
Holy cow.

3205
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:56,640
Oh, whoops.

3206
03:35:56,760 --> 03:35:57,480
That's not my match first.

3207
03:35:57,620 --> 03:35:57,900
They're real.

3208
03:36:04,510 --> 03:36:05,230
Oh, shit.

3209
03:36:15,770 --> 03:36:17,370
I'm not a traitor.

3210
03:36:17,710 --> 03:36:18,370
I don't mean to.

3211
03:36:20,790 --> 03:36:21,910
You got my money?

3212
03:36:22,050 --> 03:36:22,610
Sakugong?

3213
03:36:22,990 --> 03:36:24,190
Oh my, what the heck?

3214
03:36:24,490 --> 03:36:25,650
That felt kind of dirty.

3215
03:36:27,610 --> 03:36:28,550
Holy cow.

3216
03:36:30,070 --> 03:36:30,850
Oh my gosh!

3217
03:36:31,130 --> 03:36:31,970
Holy cow.

3218
03:36:35,030 --> 03:36:37,890
What is going on with my attacks?

3219
03:36:43,690 --> 03:36:45,670
Wait, wait, dodge this?

3220
03:36:46,790 --> 03:36:48,550
Wait, I should probably, like, heal.

3221
03:36:55,200 --> 03:36:58,980
Ooh, that was a good timing.

3222
03:37:04,330 --> 03:37:05,470
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

3223
03:37:07,690 --> 03:37:09,190
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3224
03:37:09,890 --> 03:37:13,310
I don't know why sometimes I think why is...

3225
03:37:41,910 --> 03:37:42,470
The...

3226
03:37:42,470 --> 03:37:43,330
I tried dodging.

3227
03:37:44,130 --> 03:37:45,050
Not good enough.

3228
03:37:46,570 --> 03:37:46,910
Dodge!

3229
03:37:50,790 --> 03:37:52,030
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

3230
03:37:52,510 --> 03:37:55,970
I think I had just enough...

3231
03:37:55,970 --> 03:37:57,690
stamina to do it!

3232
03:37:57,910 --> 03:37:59,930
Oh, that was so close.

3233
03:38:02,790 --> 03:38:03,850
That was so, so close.

3234
03:38:20,690 --> 03:38:22,570
Oh my gosh, I need...

3235
03:38:22,570 --> 03:38:24,410
I don't get in fast enough, you know?

3236
03:38:26,350 --> 03:38:26,370
Ah!

3237
03:38:32,180 --> 03:38:33,300
Thank you!

3238
03:38:34,960 --> 03:38:35,520
Oh,

3239
03:38:40,140 --> 03:38:40,740
phase two!

3240
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:41,920
Uh-oh.

3241
03:38:45,680 --> 03:38:47,420
What is going on here?

3242
03:38:58,010 --> 03:38:59,930
What is going on here?

3243
03:39:03,630 --> 03:39:04,890
Oh, it does hurt me, though.

3244
03:39:05,230 --> 03:39:06,870
Oh, my sanity is going crazy.

3245
03:39:07,150 --> 03:39:07,550
Hold on.

3246
03:39:07,870 --> 03:39:08,230
Oh, geez.

3247
03:39:09,310 --> 03:39:10,070
Let's full heal.

3248
03:39:15,730 --> 03:39:16,610
Oh, wait.

3249
03:39:16,910 --> 03:39:17,430
Oh, my gosh.

3250
03:39:17,990 --> 03:39:18,830
I think I need to...

3251
03:39:18,830 --> 03:39:18,990
Okay.

3252
03:39:24,150 --> 03:39:25,690
Ah, even with the comeback!

3253
03:39:26,590 --> 03:39:27,170
Oh, gosh.

3254
03:39:27,550 --> 03:39:27,970
There we go.

3255
03:39:37,800 --> 03:39:38,060
Okay.

3256
03:39:40,920 --> 03:39:42,760
Oh, I have no stamina.

3257
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:47,900
I tried dodging.

3258
03:40:06,420 --> 03:40:06,920
Yeah!

3259
03:40:11,400 --> 03:40:11,820
Gosh!

3260
03:40:12,360 --> 03:40:12,900
Okay, nice.

3261
03:40:15,140 --> 03:40:16,100
Oh,

3262
03:40:24,980 --> 03:40:25,180
shoot.

3263
03:40:26,840 --> 03:40:27,320
Oh, shoot.

3264
03:40:39,760 --> 03:40:41,200
Where is she?

3265
03:40:43,460 --> 03:40:44,120
Ouch,

3266
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:49,620
ouch, ouch, ouch.

3267
03:40:49,660 --> 03:40:51,120
Sorry, I'm so focused right now.

3268
03:40:55,220 --> 03:40:55,880
Yeah!

3269
03:40:57,140 --> 03:40:57,140
I

3270
03:41:02,540 --> 03:41:04,220
was so focused.

3271
03:41:05,440 --> 03:41:05,500
Why?

3272
03:41:13,640 --> 03:41:14,300
Eww!

3273
03:41:20,940 --> 03:41:21,660
Eww!

3274
03:41:24,040 --> 03:41:24,760
Eww!

3275
03:41:32,100 --> 03:41:32,820
Freaky.

3276
03:41:33,180 --> 03:41:34,180
Can we trust this guy?

3277
03:41:37,600 --> 03:41:41,720
What do you mean an evil?

3278
03:41:41,820 --> 03:41:42,840
This happened before?

3279
03:41:42,840 --> 03:41:43,840
She lives.

3280
03:42:06,410 --> 03:42:06,690
Okay.

3281
03:42:09,030 --> 03:42:13,890
I mean, honestly, the doll is like don't trust him, but what other choice do we have?

3282
03:42:14,390 --> 03:42:16,090
We're stuck here, otherwise, what do we do?

3283
03:42:23,310 --> 03:42:24,350
Good luck at work!

3284
03:42:24,350 --> 03:42:29,050
We're ending right after this too, so don't worry, you're not missing too much after this.

3285
03:42:34,710 --> 03:42:36,030
I'm taking a bath?

3286
03:42:38,510 --> 03:42:39,390
Let's go.

3287
03:42:50,360 --> 03:42:51,340
It's so noisy.

3288
03:42:51,740 --> 03:42:52,620
There are footsteps.

3289
03:42:55,120 --> 03:42:55,400
Okay.

3290
03:43:05,770 --> 03:43:06,570
Oh, did we drink it?

3291
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:15,320
You like rinse your mouth out.

3292
03:43:23,780 --> 03:43:25,640
Wow, how Japanese.

3293
03:43:35,820 --> 03:43:36,600
Duck, no!

3294
03:43:41,540 --> 03:43:43,920
I wonder she became a Yankee.

3295
03:43:51,330 --> 03:43:52,610
Your turn!

3296
03:43:52,810 --> 03:43:54,390
So, you, me more.

3297
03:43:57,450 --> 03:43:57,750
Hi.

3298
03:44:03,860 --> 03:44:06,740
She just starts taking off her clothes to like get in the bath.

3299
03:44:09,260 --> 03:44:09,640
What?

3300
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:17,440
She looked like me when I used that filter.

3301
03:44:20,740 --> 03:44:21,260
Um, sir?

3302
03:44:22,540 --> 03:44:23,780
Are we seeing the same thing?

3303
03:44:25,060 --> 03:44:27,300
I think it's evil water.

3304
03:44:27,960 --> 03:44:29,660
Maybe the doll is like, don't do it!

3305
03:44:33,950 --> 03:44:35,490
Something really doesn't want her to do this.

3306
03:44:35,530 --> 03:44:36,350
That's what I'm saying.

3307
03:44:42,050 --> 03:44:43,250
She looks sweaty.

3308
03:44:43,950 --> 03:44:45,210
Maybe she does need a bath.

3309
03:44:45,390 --> 03:44:45,870
I know I do.

3310
03:44:46,030 --> 03:44:46,790
I'm sweaty too.

3311
03:44:47,170 --> 03:44:47,410
It's okay.

3312
03:44:47,830 --> 03:44:49,210
We're both the same.

3313
03:44:52,810 --> 03:44:54,390
Why does she look like a hamster?

3314
03:45:09,370 --> 03:45:11,490
Me when I eat nacho cheese.

3315
03:45:17,240 --> 03:45:21,780
cleansed washed thoroughly before eating is the achievement i got

3316
03:45:26,060 --> 03:45:43,220
oh wow ninko we can tell you i fell down the stairs and became unconscious and you're just gonna be like wow it's okay stupid what are you what are you

3317
03:45:48,400 --> 03:45:50,560
Look at the way she's staring at her.

3318
03:45:50,760 --> 03:45:51,780
She looks so scary.

3319
03:45:54,060 --> 03:45:55,280
Dinko, you freak!

3320
03:46:10,720 --> 03:46:11,760
Let's go.

3321
03:46:14,060 --> 03:46:15,660
First, let me raid your house.

3322
03:46:16,040 --> 03:46:16,940
Of all your belongings.

3323
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:19,120
Let's go.

3324
03:46:19,120 --> 03:46:53,320
I think that's what he meant by he goes in the front and Hinako goes in the back She's so scary.

3325
03:46:58,150 --> 03:46:59,930
Doki bird behavior.

3326
03:47:02,710 --> 03:47:04,790
That's some real Doki bird behavior.

3327
03:47:05,430 --> 03:47:06,370
Let me stay in the middle.

3328
03:47:07,130 --> 03:47:09,930
Okay, Shu's house.

3329
03:47:11,750 --> 03:47:12,350
Sakuko.

3330
03:47:14,230 --> 03:47:16,710
Sakuko is very in touch with her spiritual side.

3331
03:47:17,190 --> 03:47:21,430
She seems to always have some god or apparition visiting her dreams, telling her about this or her.

3332
03:47:21,450 --> 03:47:48,410
that according to Sakako there's been quite the supernatural disturbance around Ebisugaoka something about an ancient god who's furious about having their followers stolen from them and now they're out for revenge or what not where's a place for me to save though somewhere please can we go back inside her house and take her things

3333
03:47:53,400 --> 03:47:54,200
It's not far?

3334
03:47:54,500 --> 03:47:54,500
Okay.

3335
03:47:54,740 --> 03:47:56,880
I'm just stealing stuff right now.

3336
03:47:59,920 --> 03:48:03,560
I heard also that in this game there's a Silent Hill 1 reference.

3337
03:48:03,740 --> 03:48:04,240
Is that true?

3338
03:48:04,620 --> 03:48:05,460
Like very small.

3339
03:48:07,500 --> 03:48:08,880
I want to find it.

3340
03:48:14,100 --> 03:48:15,260
Should be one up ahead?

3341
03:48:15,480 --> 03:48:15,960
Okay, good.

3342
03:48:17,760 --> 03:48:18,260
No!

3343
03:48:22,400 --> 03:48:23,860
Is it the fog?

3344
03:48:24,000 --> 03:48:24,260
Yeah.

3345
03:48:26,780 --> 03:48:36,220
the fog it's the fog the only thing it could be right oh

3346
03:48:48,050 --> 03:49:10,010
i guess oh it's the same one as before okay good good good panic thank you so much for the gift thank you thank you thank you i don't know iro fog was a silent hill reference i know that's why when you see fog you are like legally obligated to say wow feels very silent hill here like that you're supposed to say like This feels like Sala Hill.

3347
03:49:10,570 --> 03:49:12,750
Anytime it's foggy outside.

3348
03:49:14,590 --> 03:49:18,290
Konami will bust down your door and tell you.

3349
03:49:20,030 --> 03:49:22,790
Wait, if I change into bunny, does the sleeve still rip?

3350
03:49:24,030 --> 03:49:25,290
Let's check it out.

3351
03:49:28,780 --> 03:49:29,920
I hear, like, movement.

3352
03:49:30,220 --> 03:49:31,160
It scares me.

3353
03:49:34,020 --> 03:49:35,620
No, well, thank you so much for that, Tony.

3354
03:49:35,860 --> 03:49:36,420
Thank you.

3355
03:49:37,060 --> 03:49:38,340
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3356
03:49:38,440 --> 03:49:38,820
Thank you.

3357
03:49:42,040 --> 03:49:43,060
It is!

3358
03:49:43,160 --> 03:49:44,000
It is ripped!

3359
03:49:45,260 --> 03:49:46,580
Look how cute... Wait.

3360
03:49:47,260 --> 03:49:49,020
Oh my gosh, the like jiggle on the...

3361
03:49:49,580 --> 03:49:52,060
on the ears and the tail are so cute.

3362
03:49:57,920 --> 03:50:01,120
As far as I can tell, you never played Silent Hill 1.

3363
03:50:01,280 --> 03:50:02,420
How would I...

3364
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:06,060
How would I get the reference?

3365
03:50:06,900 --> 03:50:10,300
Well, lucky I know Silent Hill.

3366
03:50:15,120 --> 03:50:15,520
Okay.

3367
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:19,420
Anyway.

3368
03:50:21,080 --> 03:50:22,040
I'm gonna...

3369
03:50:23,080 --> 03:50:25,260
I'm gonna call it here!

3370
03:50:27,020 --> 03:50:28,280
I hear footsteps.

3371
03:50:29,800 --> 03:50:31,260
Like over in this way.

3372
03:50:32,180 --> 03:50:34,080
Hinako's rock at the Temple of Doom.

3373
03:50:36,780 --> 03:50:38,660
I don't know if you guys hear it too.

3374
03:50:39,120 --> 03:50:39,880
Nice gaming, Minto!

3375
03:50:41,720 --> 03:50:42,680
Thank you!

3376
03:50:42,920 --> 03:50:43,280
There we go!

3377
03:50:43,360 --> 03:50:44,380
Thank you so much for the peek!

3378
03:50:45,180 --> 03:50:47,060
I really appreciate it.

3379
03:50:47,160 --> 03:50:48,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3380
03:50:49,660 --> 03:50:54,860
I keep hearing footsteps, and I want to chat, but it's stressing me out a little.

3381
03:50:56,960 --> 03:50:58,580
But anyway, this was fun.

3382
03:50:58,680 --> 03:51:03,800
I wanted to make way more progress this time than I did last time since I only got to play for a tiny bit before.

3383
03:51:04,300 --> 03:51:11,140
But we made it through the big meaty man, and we made it through Sakako, question mark.

3384
03:51:11,300 --> 03:51:14,960
So I feel satisfied.

3385
03:51:15,640 --> 03:51:17,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3386
03:51:18,580 --> 03:51:19,640
Great progress.

3387
03:51:20,100 --> 03:51:20,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3388
03:51:20,820 --> 03:51:22,000
I had a lot of fun.

3389
03:51:23,380 --> 03:51:26,120
So, we will continue next time.

3390
03:51:26,300 --> 03:51:26,580
I might.

3391
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:29,740
I don't know.

3392
03:51:31,320 --> 03:51:39,200
I want to do, like, more horror games, and obviously this is a horror game, so um, like more games.

3393
03:51:39,320 --> 03:51:43,200
I want to do, like, a couple games a week since it's Halloween.

3394
03:51:44,340 --> 03:51:52,740
So, Um, yeah, maybe we'll do, like, this game twice a week or something so I can get through it.

3395
03:51:53,920 --> 03:51:54,980
Yes, yes, yes.

3396
03:51:55,760 --> 03:51:57,360
More horror, more spooky!

3397
03:51:58,020 --> 03:51:58,900
Spooky, spooky, spooky.

3398
03:52:00,280 --> 03:52:02,440
Even though it's scary, scary, scary, scary.

3399
03:52:02,980 --> 03:52:04,360
Anyway, I had so much fun.

3400
03:52:05,020 --> 03:52:06,360
Hinako, do you have anything you want to say?

3401
03:52:07,760 --> 03:52:08,660
She's shy.

3402
03:52:09,360 --> 03:52:10,580
Make me thank you!

3403
03:52:11,580 --> 03:52:12,260
Great progress.

3404
03:52:12,400 --> 03:52:13,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3405
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:19,980
I have not played Soma, so maybe that will be something I play on the list, you know.

3406
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:20,780
Isn't that a one-shot?

3407
03:52:20,860 --> 03:52:22,580
Like, I could do it in one stream or two.

3408
03:52:23,700 --> 03:52:26,540
It's not super duper long from what I...

3409
03:52:26,540 --> 03:52:27,000
No.

3410
03:52:32,920 --> 03:52:34,860
But anyway, I hate those scarecrows.

3411
03:52:35,000 --> 03:52:36,520
They were so cool, though.

3412
03:52:36,840 --> 03:52:38,640
They looked so good.

3413
03:52:38,860 --> 03:52:40,220
Like, they were so spooky.

3414
03:52:41,680 --> 03:52:43,200
Yeah, I'm really enjoying the game.

3415
03:52:43,320 --> 03:53:07,360
I know, like, a lot of people complain about the combat being a little clunky, but honestly, see that's feels like silent hills but i had fun and i have you guys too and i will see you when i see you next thank you so much for the stream and i will see you later bye bye bye bye bye bye bye thank you it's a bito
