1
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,810
Wait...

2
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,550
Does this sound weird?

3
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,670
What's going on?

4
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,570
What's going on?

5
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,890
Oh, it sounds normal.

6
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,890
I think.

7
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,750
Welcome, welcome.

8
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,130
There's a ghost in my room!

9
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,010
Don't call an exorcist.

10
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,590
Hey, that's against the rules, actually.

11
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,470
You're not allowed to call...

12
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,150
You're not allowed to say any exorcism spells.

13
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,530
Or call an exorcist.

14
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,490
Or exorcise the ghost.

15
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,670
So...

16
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,490
Ban him!

17
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,530
Ban him!

18
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,450
Ban him!

19
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,390
No, just kidding.

20
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,290
Always press the button.

21
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,090
Oh, I forgot to write.

22
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,410
I wanna write...

23
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,310
Let's see...

24
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,950
One second.

25
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,830
Times of button pressed.

26
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,420
Let's see.

27
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,760
Let's have this up...

28
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,580
Right up top.

29
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,620
Right there!

30
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,940
Nice.

31
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,500
The button has been pressed...

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,380
Zero times!

33
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,620
No exercise, chubby mint?

34
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,920
No!

35
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,040
I exorcise!

36
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
I exorcise.

37
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,720
What are you talking about?

38
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Get a functional rex, but snake comes to destroy it.

39
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
Sounds awesome, actually.

40
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,160
If snake shows up at all.

41
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,680
Win for me, baby.

42
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,420
If we can't exorcise the ghost, can the ghost at least exorcise?

43
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,000
Chubby mint, you say?

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,120
Shut up, all you degenerates.

45
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,160
Right now.

46
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,900
We're going to the chubby mint cafe.

47
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,160
Stop it!

48
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,020
Hush, hush, hush, hush.

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
You guys are unbelievable.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,380
You hear the C word and you're just like...

51
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,960
Chubby?

52
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,580
Huh?

53
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,620
Huh?

54
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,560
Huh?

55
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,420
Huh?

56
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,780
Chubby?

57
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,820
Chubby?

58
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,940
Stummy?

59
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,000
Stummy thighs?

60
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,240
Big?

61
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,880
Big?

62
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,420
Big?

63
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,280
Boobs?

64
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,600
I don't really know where I was going with that.

65
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,500
You're on activated.

66
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,360
No.

67
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,800
Anyway, what did I walk into?

68
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,800
Don't worry, please ma'am.

69
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,480
I just woke up.

70
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,600
Good morning!

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,280
I don't even know.

72
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm still tired too.

73
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,980
I woke up and immediately...

74
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,960
Immediately Matara and I recorded.

75
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,700
So I'm quite sleepy myself actually.

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,560
And I...

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
I have some stuff I need to do today.

78
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,520
So sorry.

79
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,480
So I...

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,680
I...

81
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,160
Have an early stream today.

82
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,120
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,420
Kelly, welcome back!

84
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,980
NameSword, welcome back!

85
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,580
Gerard, welcome back!

86
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,700
ZenPlex, welcome back!

87
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,340
Amy, welcome back!

88
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,120
Thank you guys.

89
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
Eepy, eepy.

90
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,280
I know, I'm so eepy lately.

91
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,720
Recently I got a...

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,780
My cats like to wake me up very early to eat.

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,640
I recently got a...

94
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,880
A food bowl that will like open up at 2 am.

95
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,600
So that they will stop waking me up.

96
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,140
Because my one cat like scratches the door.

97
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,120
And it's just the most annoying thing ever.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,520
So...

99
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,820
Textarium, welcome back!

100
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,020
Jeremy, welcome back!

101
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,420
I've also pressed the button.

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,720
Derpso, welcome back!

103
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,740
Arashi, welcome back!

104
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,900
Today we're pressing buttons.

105
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,340
You guys push my buttons.

106
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,800
Okay.

107
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,500
So this is...

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,700
A game?

109
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,260
It is a moral dilemma.

110
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,920
It is...

111
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,480
Life or death?

112
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,440
Or in my case, death or death?

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,000
Where with...

114
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,300
You give a...

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,500
You are given something good.

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,720
But...

117
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,480
It comes with a price.

118
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,720
The monkey paw curls.

119
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,280
And so...

120
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,780
Despite that...

121
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,860
That little...

122
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,600
That little finger...

123
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,240
Will you still push the button?

124
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,860
Will you be approaching these questions as made mint with made mint brain?

125
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,460
Or as made mint with a 12 year old gamer lad brain?

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,100
I think today...

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,580
We can have a...

128
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,080
We can have a...

129
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,700
A theme.

130
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,620
I would like to...

131
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,980
Maybe...

132
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,760
Every...

133
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
We can only push the button...

134
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,840
If it...

135
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
If...

136
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,260
What should the condition be?

137
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,300
We can only push the button...

138
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,490
If...

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,100
If...

140
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,220
If...

141
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,070
We can only push the button...

142
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,350
If...

143
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,710
If...

144
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:16,970
If...

145
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,430
If...

146
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:21,990
If...

147
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,670
I don't know.

148
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,570
We'll come up with that as it goes.

149
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,230
Sorry.

150
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,570
My brain is not working today.

151
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,790
Press it for Henya.

152
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,430
So, let's start with our first one.

153
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,790
Because...

154
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,310
This one seems pretty...

155
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,870
Whatever.

156
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,570
I opened a website and this is what it said.

157
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,490
Well, you press the button.

158
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,550
You master every co-op multiplayer local game ever made.

159
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,750
That's like...

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,090
A lot of games.

161
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,430
Is this the button?

162
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,190
Am I pushing it?

163
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,530
Wrong button!

164
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,210
Push the red button.

165
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,330
It is shiny and red.

166
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,130
I agree.

167
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,250
But every word you type ends with an...

168
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,010
...

169
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,530
So, what's bad about that?

170
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,350
Is it just annoying?

171
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,610
Every word?

172
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,130
So it's like...

173
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,850
It's like that Spongebob episode.

174
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,210
Is that... wait, hold on.

175
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,730
I have to lean in.

176
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,230
Hold on.

177
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,870
Is that M or RN?

178
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,200
It's RN!

179
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,540
I thought it was an M!

180
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,360
Oh my god.

181
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,580
I thought it was an M!

182
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,420
I thought it was an M!

183
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,820
Oh my god.

184
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,900
Saku!

185
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you for the...

186
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,740
I got my bonus today.

187
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,640
So it is time to spoil the Minto for all the fun times so far.

188
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,060
So it is time to spoil the Minto for all the fun times so far.

189
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,080
Stop!

190
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,980
Why do you write butaro like that?

191
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,640
Why do you write butaro like that?

192
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,040
It's some extra pads.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,260
It's bu like...

194
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,420
Minto needs glasses?

195
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,360
Oh, I have my old contacts and stuff.

196
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,460
They're not mine today.

197
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,600
Also wasn't there an Akasupa?

198
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,340
Gosher!

199
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,900
Your Akasupa before stream!

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,660
I saw it!

201
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,360
I saw it!

202
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,800
Thank you!

203
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,180
So it's like, okay.

204
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,720
It's like that Spongebob episode.

205
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,000
I... don't...under...

206
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,180
stand...

207
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,220
...your... saying.

208
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Like that.

209
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,800
Right?

210
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
I... don't...

211
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,820
...under...

212
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,260
Pfft.

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,880
Stand.

214
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,360
Pfft.

215
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,140
But instead, it's...

216
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,240
Babycore, thanks for the five gifts and...

217
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,140
Except...

218
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,620
What's so bad about this?

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
I would be amazing at games.

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,220
People would just think I'm annoying.

221
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,060
What's any different than now?

222
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,720
I would be the best there is to ever be.

223
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,860
But it's like...

224
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,460
Also, it's...

225
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,120
You master every co-op, multi-player, local game ever made.

226
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Like, that's also...

227
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,240
That's also...

228
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,880
Like...

229
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,780
Why don't you just say every game?

230
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,540
Why don't you just say every game ever made?

231
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,900
But also...

232
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,960
I don't know.

233
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,820
Part of me is like...

234
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,860
Part of me is like...

235
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,720
Then you have no challenge to get better at games.

236
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,420
It's games made today, not games made in the future?

237
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,540
No one says ever...

238
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:34,900
Oh, wait.

239
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,840
Ever made ever?

240
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,760
Ever made from when?

241
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,140
Now?

242
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,460
Yeah, learning is fun.

243
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,260
But the money.

244
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,720
What?

245
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,260
Because I would be like a pro gamer?

246
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,860
People would definitely think I was cheating.

247
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,580
Tis himself.

248
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,820
Thanks for the ten gifted.

249
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,040
I guess not single player games.

250
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,660
Oh.

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh, that's what they mean by local games then.

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,020
Ah.

253
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,640
Oh, my God.

254
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,740
Oh, my God.

255
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,840
I would be God at Mario Party.

256
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,140
I would be God at Mario Kart.

257
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,180
Local includes single probably.

258
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,020
That's what I was thinking though with the local.

259
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,420
But I guess if it means like local multi...

260
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,100
I don't know actually.

261
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,180
You would be an Apex Legend.

262
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,260
I'm already an Apex Legend.

263
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,120
I don't know if you guys know that or anything.

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,240
You could speed run Metal Gear.

265
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:56,560
I don't think I could ever speed run Metal Gear because the only way I would speed run Metal Gear is if I am given...

266
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,220
If I can watch the cutscenes because I cannot...

267
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,480
I physically cannot skip cutscenes.

268
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
I just love watching them so much.

269
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,280
Okay.

270
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,580
Let's see you in the next video.

271
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,140
Minto, new Apex Legend come, bear.

272
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,340
Yeah.

273
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,700
Dumb.

274
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,980
Got the stream before my bedtime.

275
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,920
Good night, Charles.

276
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,880
Thank you for always warning .

277
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,140
I've been a silent viewer for a long while.

278
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,240
I wanted to finally say thanks for all the laughs and good times.

279
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,140
Thank you.

280
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,460
Really appreciate it.

281
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you.

282
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,600
Thank you.

283
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:31,980
Thank you.

284
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,080
Yeah.

285
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,660
New category, cut scene percent.

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,140
Sure, Jane.

287
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,120
It's Jan!

288
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,720
If you're gonna quote the line, get the name right.

289
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,880
It's not Jane, it was Sure, Jan.

290
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh my god.

291
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,920
I've never seen anyone stream MGS4.

292
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,160
Not yet.

293
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,440
Just wait until I get back.

294
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,500
When we start our Metal Gear Solid journey.

295
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,060
Uh-huh-huh!

296
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

297
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,600
Stop reading my typos.

298
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Can't wait for the MGS4 watch-along.

299
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:25,880
Yippee!

300
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,160
No one can spell today.

301
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,020
Yippee!

302
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,680
Is it MGS4?

303
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,560
Is MGS4 locked behind a PS4?

304
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
Uh, no, PS3.

305
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
I have my PS3 for it.

306
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,100
Yes.

307
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,940
I have it.

308
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,540
I have it.

309
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,360
I have it all set up.

310
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,420
I could play it right now if I would...

311
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,740
Actually, no, because I would have to set up.

312
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,460
I would have to set up everything.

313
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,160
But I could do it today if I even wanted to.

314
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,160
I could.

315
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,720
But then I would cry because it's MGS4.

316
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,560
Anyway!

317
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,580
You know what?

318
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,100
I don't care.

319
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,780
I don't...

320
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,180
You know what?

321
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,860
Multiplayer games...

322
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm gonna assume that local games is like local, you know, like...

323
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,720
It's multiplayer, but it's not online multiplayer.

324
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm not gonna assume that it's...

325
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,460
That it's single-player games.

326
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm going to push the button.

327
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,660
Because...

328
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,960
Who cares if everybody just hears me go...

329
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,360
Mmm...

330
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,000
Mmm...

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,820
Mmm...

332
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:27,960
Mmm...

333
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,180
Mmm...

334
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,740
Every word ends with...

335
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,420
So, it's like...

336
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,780
Hey...

337
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,160
You...

338
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,420
Get good...

339
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,020
Wait...

340
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,240
Get...

341
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,940
Good...

342
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,220
At...

343
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,260
The...

344
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,460
Game...

345
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,840
Oh, it's R-N.

346
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,480
Shoot.

347
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,220
It's R-N.

348
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,640
Hold on.

349
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,900
Uh...

350
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,220
Uh...

351
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,920
Get...

352
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,200
Get...

353
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,780
Good...

354
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,940
At...

355
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,460
The...

356
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,060
Game...

357
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,180
Oh, my gosh.

358
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,660
It would piss people off even more.

359
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,160
Oh, my gosh.

360
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,780
Oh, my god.

361
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,180
It would make people so angry.

362
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,540
Because they would be bad.

363
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,500
And then they would also see me typing so annoyingly.

364
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, my god.

365
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:16,840
Get...

366
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,980
Get...

367
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,800
Good...

368
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,560
Comment...

369
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,460
Pashamin...

370
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,420
Comment...

371
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,020
Now...

372
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,680
What time is it?

373
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Isn't it too early?

374
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,460
Isn't it too early?

375
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,560
Are you okay?

376
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,180
Are you still...

377
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,840
Are you still not asleep?

378
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,660
Oh, my gosh.

379
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
It would be just like a plane.

380
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,640
Time to change all your passwords.

381
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,260
Oh, my gosh.

382
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,980
That would be so bad.

383
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,860
If my password leaked, you would know exactly what the last two letters of my password will be.

384
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,620
Her...

385
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:53,980
Metal...

386
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,700
Metal...

387
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,520
Gear...

388
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,640
Gate...

389
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,220
Gate...

390
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,540
Gate...

391
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,020
My own...

392
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,860
It feels like I'm reading LulitSpeak or something.

393
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,780
It's so bad.

394
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,460
Hello, Maya!

395
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,240
Hello, Maya!

396
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, my gosh.

397
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,360
Wait.

398
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,800
But also...

399
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
But also...

400
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,240
You guys, I would have to make every...

401
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,140
I would have to make every tweet a voice tweet because nobody would want to read my tweets anymore because I don't understand a word she said.

402
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,940
Because every word that I would type would end in R-N.

403
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,180
Oh my gosh, wait.

404
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,940
Does this include business emails and stuff?

405
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,940
Okay, they would just think I'm really into the character, you know?

406
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,300
They'd be like...

407
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Nobody would want to...

408
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,400
It's career suicide, but it doesn't matter.

409
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,680
All I have to do is speak.

410
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,760
It's only typing!

411
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,780
Press the button!

412
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,860
Oh!

413
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,020
Oh wait, hold on.

414
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,700
I have a button pressing thing.

415
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,320
There we go.

416
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,160
50-50.

417
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,500
50-50!

418
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,240
Would press the button!

419
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,960
That's so crazy!

420
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
50-50!

421
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,720
What would you guys do?

422
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,360
Would you press it?

423
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,660
Would you press the button?

424
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,700
You can do voice to text for a loophole.

425
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
So true!

426
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,420
So true!

427
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,440
I would not.

428
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,080
What's wrong with you guys?

429
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,040
Let's try the next one.

430
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,860
How is this an issue for me?

431
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,240
How is this an issue for me?

432
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,300
How is this an issue for me?

433
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,400
What is inside of my 있습니다?

434
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,720
It's too bad I can't do aan.

435
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,420
Wonder why everyone in my world could haveussed such an issue for everyone?

436
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,720
Butterfly is trying to survive in the world...

437
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
But...

438
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,780
It might beV

439
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:35,040
CHRIS isquesit All of my secret stans What?

440
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,360
Why did you not press the button?

441
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,040
It's a win-win, everybody!

442
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,300
Girls!

443
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,880
Girls rule the world!

444
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Let's see...

445
00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:02,400
When you press the button, you get a million dollars, but you have to spend one night, 9pm to 6am, in a sentient Walmart that's trying to kill you the entire time.

446
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,320
You can't bring in weapons, but you can use any weapons or objects you find in the store.

447
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,020
Well, luckily it's a Walmart, so...

448
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,740
There's already guns in there.

449
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,400
What are you talking about?

450
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,460
It's not even 20 minutes ago.

451
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,000
What do you mean?

452
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,400
What do you mean?

453
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
For a million dollars though?

454
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,660
For a million dollars?

455
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,000
Hmm...

456
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,860
And then what?

457
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,420
9pm to 6am.

458
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,340
How long is that?

459
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,400
9 to 10, 10 to 11, 12... wait...

460
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,520
9 to 10, 10 to 11, 11 to 12, 12 to 1, 1 to 2, 1 to 2, 3 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6...

461
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,260
9 hours?

462
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,480
9 hours for a million dollars?

463
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,680
I mean, untaxed, right?

464
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,960
A million dollars doesn't really get you that... I mean, it's a lot, don't get me wrong, but like...

465
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,420
Hmm...

466
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,840
It's not like what it used to be, you know?

467
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,660
Like, it's not like what it used to be.

468
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,160
Oh, I didn't update the button counter.

469
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,860
You're right, thank you.

470
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,920
I pressed the button two times already.

471
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,960
Dang.

472
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,800
You still

473
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,210
have to pay taxes on this?

474
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,650
That's like risking my life!

475
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,480
What's the most dangerous thing in Walmart?

476
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,840
Walmart.

477
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,500
Walmart.

478
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,120
I absolutely would, no question.

479
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,360
But best case, get eaten by a sentient Walmart.

480
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,540
Worst case, I get a million dollars.

481
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,040
It says it's trying to kill you, but they didn't say...

482
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,340
They didn't say how you would die.

483
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,460
Because what if it is... I mean, if it's like...

484
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh my gosh, wait.

485
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,200
What if the Walmart is like a monster girl?

486
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,320
Oh my god, wait.

487
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,960
Can I riz the Walmart?

488
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,740
Wait.

489
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,620
If it's like a, you know...

490
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,100
It's like a...

491
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,880
It's like a monster girl who's like...

492
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,360
Trying to, trying to, you know...

493
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,940
Wait.

494
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,960
Actually cooking?

495
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,700
Romance route?

496
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,440
Yeah, let her cook, yeah?

497
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,460
Like monster house?

498
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,560
Oh my god.

499
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,860
Like, you've seen those, like...

500
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Where there's like...

501
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,280
It's like...

502
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,640
It looks like, you know...

503
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,820
Something unassuming, but it's actually a monster girl.

504
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,480
Thanks for the super time!

505
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,840
Thank you for the donut!

506
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,340
As a Canadian, I wouldn't have to pay taxes on the million.

507
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,080
But also as a Canadian, there would be no guns in the Walmart.

508
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,880
True, true, true.

509
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,140
It's a girl house.

510
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,100
So, let's see what the rest of this hacer will be like.

511
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,160
I mean, sentient Walmart.

512
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,940
And also, like, how is it trying to kill me?

513
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,720
Like, what's it doing?

514
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,060
Like, what, if I try to step outside, it closes the door on my foot?

515
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,100
Like, it doesn't...

516
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,280
It doesn't really make much sense, I feel.

517
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,860
Like, it feels kind of like...

518
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,520
What, what, do they control everything inside the Walmart?

519
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,640
Do they control everything inside the Walmart?

520
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,540
How can a Walmart kill you if you're already dead?

521
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,920
We're under the assumption that I'm alive, okay?

522
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,840
Which is really weird to think about, but...

523
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,600
You can see under Walmart's dress.

524
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,980
Raiders?

525
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,380
Oh!

526
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,200
I don't see, I don't see, I don't see...

527
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Who raided me but thank you!

528
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,580
I think my pinned comment is blocking...

529
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,760
Sorry, yabe, I'm taking off your pinned comment.

530
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,460
I really liked it though.

531
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,780
Robo, thanks for the vibe gifted!

532
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,040
I'm cut.

533
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,420
I think this one is kind of... well, okay.

534
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,000
What if it's not a monster girl?

535
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,160
It will not push the button.

536
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,640
I think this one is kind of whatever.

537
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,430
54% did not.

538
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,090
I am of the majority.

539
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,570
I am of the majority.

540
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,070
He beat me a lot.

541
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,030
Thank you!

542
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,230
Thank you, thank you.

543
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,270
What if it's two monster girls?

544
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,690
Andrey goes thanks for the 10 gifted!

545
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,410
Let's see.

546
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,810
Alright, let's try the next one.

547
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,690
You can create anything you think of in a matter of seconds.

548
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,870
It will be destroyed within 10 minutes.

549
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,740
Okay, this one seems way better than it seems worse.

550
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,200
Okay, hold on.

551
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,920
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

552
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,180
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

553
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,680
Everybody's saying why not.

554
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,500
Everybody's saying press.

555
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,680
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

556
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,380
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

557
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,920
You create your dream girl.

558
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
You create a cat girl.

559
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,780
You're just like, I can create anything.

560
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,160
I create animals.

561
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,540
I make girl in real life.

562
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,140
You fall in love.

563
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,180
You fall in love!

564
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,180
And then they're destroyed in 10 minutes!

565
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,760
No doubts.

566
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,640
Just create her every 10 minutes.

567
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,560
You have to...

568
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,760
Oh my gosh, what if she...

569
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,540
What if they like...

570
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,760
But it says destroyed.

571
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
That implies like she'll be in pain.

572
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,160
She'll be like destroyed, you know, in like a...

573
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,100
In like a painful, awful, terrible way.

574
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,180
She'll feel it every time.

575
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,140
Congratulations on your newborn son.

576
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,560
I created a son?

577
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,330
Giving her the ReZero experience.

578
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,590
You guys have a lot of opinions on this one.

579
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,390
Holy cow.

580
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,390
It's useful though.

581
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,570
I'd say it's more useful.

582
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,430
Think of food.

583
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,030
Eat food.

584
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,410
Food goes away after you're done.

585
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,490
No getting fat.

586
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,430
So if I just think of food...

587
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,270
Create con ticket, airplane ticket, money, etc.

588
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,550
So you use the money.

589
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,350
Oh my gosh, wait.

590
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,290
You use the money.

591
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,570
You use the money.

592
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,930
You use the money.

593
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,870
And then you...

594
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,050
Then you...

595
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,110
Then you pay for the thing.

596
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,710
And then it disappears.

597
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:11,810
It disappears.

598
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,310
It's...

599
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,390
Oh my gosh.

600
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,970
It's foolproof.

601
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:14,950
It's robbery.

602
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,130
It's highway robbery.

603
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,630
In a world where there is a ghost maid that is minty with a weird obsession of metal gear.

604
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,610
Thanks.

605
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,170
She's called mid-mid-chan.

606
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,090
Kimani.

607
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,850
Welcome back.

608
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,330
Thank you.

609
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,710
Create a cold fusion reactor.

610
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,250
Study the design file patent.

611
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,470
What is a cold fusion reactor?

612
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:46,970
I'm scared.

613
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,150
What are you trying to create?

614
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,470
You can also create a disappearing murder weapon.

615
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,010
You know, I thought of that also too.

616
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,430
This is like the perfect way to commit a crime.

617
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,730
It has...

618
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,510
It definitely...

619
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,230
Thank you.

620
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,890
This definitely feels like it has more uses than not uses, right?

621
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,370
But also...

622
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,610
Isn't it that...

623
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:14,450
That...

624
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,850
Oh, it's infinite energy.

625
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:16,430
Oh.

626
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,890
But isn't it energy can't be created or destroyed?

627
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,510
So if you create something and it's destroyed within 10 minutes, where is it going?

628
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,590
It's just gone.

629
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,290
Magic.

630
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,870
Black hole.

631
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,910
What if it's making the black hole bigger?

632
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,810
I use this power to create this super I will disappear in 10 minutes mint.

633
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,190
I saw it.

634
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:56,590
I saw it.

635
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,130
I saw it.

636
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:00,810
Moerugomi.

637
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,250
You actually changed your name.

638
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,850
Create Oshii's open up meet and greet shop profit.

639
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,570
Thank you.

640
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,910
Thank you.

641
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:07,630
Chuu.

642
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,610
Chuu.

643
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,210
I'll call this waifu creation power.

644
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,870
51st creation dates.

645
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,570
The circle of waifu.

646
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,350
Okay fine.

647
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,090
We'll push the button.

648
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,610
Yeah, I figured most people would be pushing this.

649
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,590
We have pushed the button 3 times.

650
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,830
Okay, I'm going to give myself a limit.

651
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,070
I'm going to give myself a limit you guys.

652
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,850
I can only push the button 10 times.

653
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:52,070
We are going to have to be extremely Be extremely... careful about what we are pushing the button for.

654
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,970
What happens if you exceed it?

655
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,410
Then you guys can choose a punishment for me.

656
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,370
We'll think of a... maybe I'll have to do a punishment stream or a punishment tweet or something.

657
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,590
So.

658
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,050
So!

659
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,090
For these next ones.

660
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,310
I've already pushed it three times.

661
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,650
I've already pushed it.

662
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,430
I've been willy-nilly.

663
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,290
Okay, wait.

664
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,830
Two of them have been very good.

665
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,710
The seeing up this girl's skirts and see and push and creating anything.

666
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,290
I think both of those were good pushes.

667
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,150
I don't remember what the first one was.

668
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,510
How much for a comment section override?

669
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,030
What's that?

670
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,630
I don't remember what the first one was.

671
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,490
Oh!

672
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,450
It was the R.

673
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,750
I'm off to a con now.

674
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,350
Have fun everybody.

675
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,010
Remember, Minto is cute.

676
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,150
Thank you.

677
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,170
Have a good time at your con.

678
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,310
Okay.

679
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,160
You can have... Okay.

680
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,300
Will you press the button?

681
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,280
You can have any car you want for free and no problems attached.

682
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,040
Okay.

683
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,040
You can have...

684
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Okay.

685
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Will you press the button?

686
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,040
You can have any car you want for free and no problems attached.

687
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,740
But every time you drive it for a total of one hour, your life gets shorter by one year.

688
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,060
I don't care about cars.

689
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,320
Do you guys... Are you guys car people?

690
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,180
I think I know... I think there's a few people maybe in the chat that are car people but...

691
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,920
Always be the passenger?

692
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,540
I'll hire a driver.

693
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,300
I like cars but no...

694
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Thank you.

695
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,420
Thank you.

696
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,500
Like I don't... I don't think I've ever had like a dream car or anything like that.

697
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,540
So...

698
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,960
Create nanomachines.

699
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,400
Nanomachines creates more nanomachines.

700
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,780
Original nanomachines disappear.

701
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,120
New nanomachines make a new war.

702
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,560
Fist fight a cyborg on top of a giant robot.

703
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,640
Yeah!

704
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,440
Just sell it.

705
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,600
So it's every time I drive it, right?

706
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,220
So...

707
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,760
I could... Yeah, I could generate any car that I want.

708
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,820
But what if I like generate it?

709
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,640
What if I have it?

710
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,960
Oh wait, it's not generate it.

711
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,660
What if I have it?

712
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,040
People might be like...

713
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,640
Where did you get that car?

714
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,260
I still don't think it's worth it though.

715
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,340
I don't care about cars.

716
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,840
Ka-chow!

717
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,500
Selling for money, especially rare ones.

718
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,860
That sounds like such a pain in the butt, right?

719
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,200
What if...

720
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,320
But then also...

721
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,920
You know...

722
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,300
You know...

723
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,540
Let's just...

724
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:44,900
Let's...

725
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,740
We don't know exactly how this works.

726
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:53,820
What if also the person driving it gets their life shorter by one year?

727
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,340
Do I have to disclose that?

728
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,720
Then nobody will buy them, you know?

729
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,760
Oh, it's also...

730
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,940
Wait, it says you can have any car you want for free.

731
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,480
No problem.

732
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,480
No problem.

733
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,440
It says any car.

734
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,720
Is it unlimited?

735
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,820
Is it just one?

736
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,660
Who knows?

737
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,480
I'll sell it to my enemy.

738
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,120
It says you.

739
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,320
Yeah, but...

740
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,940
I don't know.

741
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,380
What if I accidentally drive the car and I don't realize it?

742
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,950
What if the car somehow comes back to me?

743
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,750
And I accidentally drive it.

744
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,690
And I drive it for like...

745
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,150
10 hours.

746
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,090
That's a long time!

747
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,370
Drive!

748
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,230
Just have my car and drive it.

749
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,630
Who do you think I was talking about when I said my enemy?

750
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,450
Ronan, thank you!

751
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,250
What if...

752
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,150
What if I...

753
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,270
Can you drive?

754
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,370
I can, I can drive.

755
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:04,990
I can, I can.

756
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,310
So...

757
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,570
It's the plot of a Stephen King book?

758
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,250
No way!

759
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:14,970
I...

760
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:15,830
I...

761
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,130
There's one...

762
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,650
What's it called?

763
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,290
There's one...

764
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:19,930
One...

765
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,250
There's only one Stephen King book that I can think of.

766
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,850
That involves some yabai stuff in a car.

767
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,290
Lifespan shortening is a pretty big problem.

768
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,090
For maybe a human.

769
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,910
But let's just assume I'm human in some of these.

770
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,070
Or in all of these, you know?

771
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,070
Let's just assume I'm alive and I'm well and I'm healthy.

772
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,650
At a ripe young age.

773
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,050
I don't think I will.

774
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,530
I don't like driving anyway, but I don't think I'm gonna press the button.

775
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,770
Oh, most people did not press the button.

776
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,150
That's crazy.

777
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,500
Okay, will you...

778
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,260
Come on.

779
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,320
Come on!

780
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,520
These are so...

781
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,320
These are so...

782
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,460
These are so...

783
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,980
Pulling the world peace card is just...

784
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,900
It's too...

785
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,940
It's too easy.

786
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,380
It's too easy.

787
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,060
Come on.

788
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,600
Sci-fi...

789
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:29,040
World peace is achieved, but sci-fi, country, rock and metal music, video games and books are abolished.

790
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,420
This is so stupid.

791
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,060
This is so dumb.

792
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,500
Who wrote this?

793
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,980
Like a ten-year-old wrote this.

794
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,100
Also, it's like sci-fi...

795
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,540
Wait, sci-fi...

796
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,300
Is not a music genre.

797
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,280
This is so stupid.

798
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,080
I will not push the button because I don't want to give this kid the satisfaction.

799
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,460
But also, it's just like...

800
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,780
I've watched Macross and music will save the world.

801
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,460
I will not push the button!

802
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,600
Most people agree with me.

803
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
There are still sports.

804
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,040
Yeah, I skip out a protest.

805
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,220
Screw the world.

806
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,360
I need my escapism.

807
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,400
Yeah!

808
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,080
Get out of here, world peace!

809
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,580
Video games!

810
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,400
Video games!

811
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,120
Video games!

812
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,700
Video games!

813
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,320
There's no video games.

814
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm basically out of a job.

815
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,880
The world can burn.

816
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,420
Burn!

817
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,520
Break stuff is a metal song, so we would miss you singing that.

818
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,940
Yeah, without...

819
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,540
Yeah, exactly!

820
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,780
Exactly!

821
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,440
Also, why did they include...

822
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,960
Like...

823
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,120
These random assortment of...

824
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,180
Why didn't they just say music?

825
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,460
Why is it only country rock and metal music?

826
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,060
What about pop music?

827
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,180
What about...

828
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,200
I mean, that means like...

829
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,720
A lot of idols would still exist.

830
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,720
But why...

831
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,980
Yeah, no Metal Gear!

832
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,200
I would just...

833
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,040
I would rather...

834
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,820
I would rather die again.

835
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,780
No, no, no.

836
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,820
Anime is still in though.

837
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,340
Yeah, but you would have no anime openings.

838
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,920
An anime...

839
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,600
You would have no anime openings and closing songs.

840
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,020
Well, you would have only...

841
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,340
Yeah, if it's anisong...

842
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,780
Actually, if it's anisong...

843
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,620
What if it's a country anisong?

844
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,980
What if it's a rock anisong?

845
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,200
But it's classified under anisong.

846
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,280
I mean...

847
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,680
Hmm...

848
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,460
Hmm...

849
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,760
Hmm...

850
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,960
Found the loophole.

851
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,680
Still, I can't get over sci-fi.

852
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,320
I can't get over sci-fi.

853
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,620
Can't get over sci-fi.

854
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,980
Country anisong.

855
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,330
Oh, country...

856
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,320
Oh, yeah, there is country anisong.

857
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,340
Country roads.

858
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,760
This road.

859
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,740
Forever.

860
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,340
This isn't a video game.

861
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,700
It's an interactive story.

862
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,280
No more Konosuba endings?

863
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,100
That would be so sad.

864
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,700
No more Cyberpunk OST.

865
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,340
Is that sci-fi music?

866
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,410
It's a vicious cycle.

867
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,470
You get world peace but you have people starting wars to get back video games.

868
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,470
Yeah.

869
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,390
I need war so Metal Gear is created.

870
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,850
Just kidding.

871
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,430
That's because I'm a big fan of Super Cat.

872
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,990
Thank you for the super chat.

873
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,870
Hahaha.

874
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,330
Okay, next.

875
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,150
You press the button.

876
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,050
You get paid $20 an hour to play video games.

877
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,150
Okay.

878
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:07,550
The only games you can play are Mario Kart Wii, Farmville, the first one, Sonic 06, and Candy Crush Saga.

879
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,310
Uh, $20 an hour to play video games.

880
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,790
Someone said only $20!

881
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,190
What do you mean?

882
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,830
I mean, that's a lot.

883
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,610
That's a lot of money to play video games.

884
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,180
SonicOak6's peak present.

885
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,080
Not gonna lie.

886
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,100
I was thinking about streaming it somewhat recently.

887
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,680
What is Farmville?

888
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,360
What is Farmville?

889
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,020
Farm...ville.

890
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,400
What is this?

891
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,920
Play SonicOak6.

892
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,180
I live this.

893
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,260
Don't take the deal.

894
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,820
What are you talking about Hayden?

895
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,280
It's $800 a month?

896
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,280
Oh, I would definitely need another job then.

897
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,020
Right?

898
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,400
Wait, what do you mean $800?

899
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:06,840
Wait.

900
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,620
No, it's $20 per hour.

901
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,520
It's $20 per hour!

902
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
So if I play Candy Crush for...

903
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:19,980
For like...

904
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,800
Forever?

905
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,800
You know?

906
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,720
That would be... you know, it's per...

907
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,560
We're not... who's to say that I have to stop at 40...

908
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,400
Who's to say that I have to stop at 40... 40... 40 hours, right?

909
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,180
Who's to say?

910
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,000
You'll want to stop.

911
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,880
What do you do in Farmville?

912
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,860
It's a Facebook game?

913
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:58,020
A series of agriculture simulation social network games developed and published by Zynga in 2009.

914
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,740
Sorry.

915
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,220
Oh my god.

916
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,340
I think my...

917
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,040
I think my... I think my... I think my... I think my...

918
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,580
I think my cafe is haunted.

919
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,440
My lights just flickered.

920
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,020
I've seen Vtubers play worse than this.

921
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,780
So you guys wouldn't hate if I became a...

922
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:24,640
A Farmville Mario Kart Wii Sonic 06 Candy Crush Saga streamer?

923
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,140
Can you Zoomer Max and have multiple Candy Crush gameplay windows on stream and get paid more?

924
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,260
Hell yeah.

925
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,190
I'd be down.

926
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,830
I'm clearing my schedule.

927
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,710
I would judge you but I would still watch.

928
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:59,390
Wait, if I was Mario Kart Wii, would you guys be able to play?

929
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,170
It would be sad there's no MGS.

930
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,090
Yeah, add Metal Gear in here.

931
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,630
No more Metal Gear.

932
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,310
Now I also wonder, the only games you can play are these.

933
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,090
Are they the only games that I can play to get paid?

934
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,810
Or can I...

935
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,290
Can I...

936
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,490
Can I...

937
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,090
Can I also...

938
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,630
Play things without getting paid?

939
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,810
I wonder.

940
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,510
Lupin!

941
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,830
Can only to get paid?

942
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,650
No, only those ever?

943
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,770
It doesn't say.

944
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,250
It's unclear.

945
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,210
It's unclear!

946
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:40,290
It's unclear!

947
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,510
I'd assume only those games at all.

948
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,130
Then I will not push the button.

949
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:50,590
Wow!

950
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,750
That's actually pretty close.

951
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,750
But you know what?

952
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:53,710
I get it.

953
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,430
I get it.

954
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,270
If it's $20...

955
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,490
If you don't play video games very much and it's just like...

956
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,110
I don't care about video games.

957
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,910
And you're just like, I'm gonna make $20 an hour.

958
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,690
Which is good!

959
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,790
That's good!

960
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,530
To make good $20, right?

961
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,570
To make that...

962
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,050
I mean...

963
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:09,770
I...

964
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:10,990
I...

965
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,730
I never made that much at a job.

966
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,110
So...

967
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,070
Yeah...

968
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,230
To do that...

969
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,550
Not so much anymore?

970
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,230
Really?

971
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,480
Depends on where you live.

972
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,340
Well, to me...

973
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,320
To me, it feels like a lot.

974
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,320
To me, it feels like a lot.

975
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,960
As a former game tester, it isn't worth it.

976
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,140
We have...

977
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,400
We have the...

978
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,240
We have the...

979
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,560
The real testimonies of Trevor.

980
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,780
Thank you, Trevor.

981
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,780
$20 is $20.

982
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,720
So true.

983
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,360
Thank you.

984
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,140
Thank you for the $20.

985
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:02,900
Let's see.

986
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,240
What else?

987
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,000
What's the next one?

988
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,660
Okay.

989
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,140
Wait a second, though.

990
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,600
Hold on.

991
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:10,920
Hold on.

992
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,120
Hold on.

993
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,560
Before we get ahead of ourselves...

994
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,280
Before...

995
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,280
This game...

996
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:14,600
This...

997
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,100
This site is making me...

998
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,840
It's trying to turn me into a pervert, I think.

999
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:19,860
Hold on.

1000
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,160
Before we get too excited...

1001
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,340
Before we get too excited...

1002
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,300
You can see through all clothes.

1003
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:26,940
One.

1004
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,440
Can I turn this power off?

1005
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,020
Two.

1006
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,900
Can I decide whose clothes I want to see through?

1007
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,460
You know?

1008
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,490
I don't want to see through everybody's clothes.

1009
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,050
I don't want to see through everybody's clothes.

1010
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,950
Read the downside.

1011
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,430
But you cannot turn the power off.

1012
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,350
Oh.

1013
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:53,390
Okay.

1014
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,270
Wait a second.

1015
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,050
Wait a second.

1016
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,170
Okay.

1017
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:05,630
I read the button when I first pushed this, but I thought it meant, like, the power...

1018
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,110
Like, electricity power.

1019
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,810
I thought it meant, like...

1020
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,350
When you...

1021
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,470
When you're trying to...

1022
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,150
When you're trying to sleep, the lights are left on.

1023
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,730
Mean greet would be awkward.

1024
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:22,930
No!

1025
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:26,510
You guys, nobody would come to my mean greet knowing that I'm staring at them naked.

1026
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,650
Or maybe you would, you little freaks.

1027
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,630
Maybe you would.

1028
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,650
You'd be like, oh my god.

1029
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,690
I'm into seeing my naked body right now.

1030
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:40,750
Wouldn't you feel self-conscious, though?

1031
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,030
I totally would.

1032
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,670
You little freaks.

1033
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,950
But you can't turn the power off.

1034
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,050
So I just see everybody's naked.

1035
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,290
Eventually, at some point...

1036
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,930
At some point...

1037
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:55,590
Oh my gosh, no.

1038
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:56,570
I will not push this.

1039
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,670
I will not push this.

1040
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:58,410
Because...

1041
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,390
Because...

1042
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,070
Clothing is sexy, everybody, okay?

1043
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,650
Clothing is sexy.

1044
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,090
That would mean no more bunny girl outfits.

1045
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,550
No more maid outfits.

1046
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:10,730
No more...

1047
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,990
No more swimsuits.

1048
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:12,590
Nothing.

1049
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,030
It would just be naked bodies everywhere.

1050
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,290
That's not sexy at all.

1051
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,130
It would be so boring.

1052
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,190
Then I would just be so sad.

1053
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,390
No cosplay ever, ever, ever, ever.

1054
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,350
I would be so sad.

1055
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,110
Oh my god.

1056
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,190
No!

1057
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,550
I just...

1058
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,290
This sounds really...

1059
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,310
Anybody who pushes this button is so sad, I think.

1060
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,010
I think.

1061
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:40,710
I think.

1062
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:41,050
But...

1063
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:44,350
Man...

1064
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,130
It's actually a wholesome reason.

1065
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:46,950
Is it...

1066
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,290
Is it wholesome for me to want to be like...

1067
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,130
Um...

1068
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:54,030
To be like...

1069
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:55,930
Um...

1070
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,290
What do I...

1071
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,570
To...

1072
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,090
To...

1073
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,010
To be obsessed with cosplay?

1074
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,850
Is that wholesome?

1075
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,570
I'm not sure.

1076
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,810
But anyway...

1077
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,590
I will not be pushing the button.

1078
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,130
Okay.

1079
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:11,570
See?

1080
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,230
Three out of ten times so far.

1081
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:13,690
Oh!

1082
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,990
Most people did not push the button.

1083
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,770
Very good.

1084
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:18,650
Very good.

1085
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,390
Also, there's a comment.

1086
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:26,050
The first comment on here says, what if you can't find your own clothes because you can't see them?

1087
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,010
That's true.

1088
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,370
Because other people wouldn't have the power.

1089
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,910
And you can't find your own clothes.

1090
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,710
You can't find your own clothes because...

1091
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,490
Because you can't see them.

1092
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,630
And then you can never go outside because...

1093
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,410
What do you...

1094
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,850
Wait, I guess you would have to wrap yourself in a blanket all the time.

1095
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,250
Blankets not clothes.

1096
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,610
Found the monkey paw.

1097
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,710
I feel like a...

1098
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,630
I feel like a kid wrote this question too.

1099
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,170
Next.

1100
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,030
Will you press the button?

1101
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,590
You can fly but you can't speak anymore.

1102
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,250
And tweet like a bird.

1103
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,570
So I'm like...

1104
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,670
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

1105
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,270
Weep, weep, weep, weep, weep.

1106
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:14,890
Like that?

1107
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:15,610
Or...

1108
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:18,890
Should I become a bird?

1109
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,890
Sign language?

1110
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,890
You can fly but...

1111
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:25,450
Hmm.

1112
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,670
Yeah, you could just learn sign language, right?

1113
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,270
Or...

1114
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,300
Or tweet...

1115
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,080
Or sound like a bird.

1116
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,600
Talk with chat GPT.

1117
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,240
No.

1118
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,540
Yeah, tech.

1119
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,460
You mean text to speech.

1120
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,480
Yeah, use a keyboard.

1121
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,700
And then you can fly.

1122
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,980
Flying is like the best power ever.

1123
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,040
Right?

1124
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,740
I can flow.

1125
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,080
I can fly a little bit.

1126
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,960
But not like...

1127
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,300
I can't...

1128
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:56,840
Not so good.

1129
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,420
You're already fly AF.

1130
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,580
Oh my gosh.

1131
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,920
Magic doodoo Johnson.

1132
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:03,520
Thank you.

1133
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,860
I'm like...

1134
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,920
She's so fly.

1135
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,140
Chirp, chirp.

1136
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:08,540
Fly away.

1137
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,460
Oh my gosh.

1138
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,520
You can flow.

1139
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah.

1140
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,280
Flying is dangerous power but can be fun.

1141
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,360
Why do you think it's dangerous?

1142
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,940
Speak Vocaloid.

1143
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,620
Because like...

1144
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,800
Teleport is better?

1145
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,580
No.

1146
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,020
I think...

1147
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,280
Even still, I think I would rather fly than teleport.

1148
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,200
Depending on like how you're able to fly, right?

1149
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,440
Because...

1150
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:39,680
Because...

1151
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,280
Because...

1152
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,680
Because...

1153
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,440
Because...

1154
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,800
If it uses like a lot of energy, then of course then teleporting might be better.

1155
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,500
But like...

1156
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,760
If you're flying, it's nice.

1157
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,280
Unless it's raining or something.

1158
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:50,780
I don't know.

1159
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,520
If the weather is good, you're just like...

1160
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,420
You're in the clouds and it's nice and breezy and you enjoy the journey.

1161
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,700
I guess it depends.

1162
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,940
You enjoy the journey or not.

1163
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,860
When I tweet, can I communicate with other birds?

1164
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,700
This is important.

1165
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,860
That's true.

1166
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,380
Do I gain bird powers?

1167
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,400
Can I control the pigeon?

1168
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:12,420
Can I control the pigeon?

1169
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,300
I like mince boys.

1170
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,700
Yeah, you lay eggs.

1171
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:27,900
Wait.

1172
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,000
Free food.

1173
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,480
Wait.

1174
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,700
If I lay eggs and I eat them, is that eating my own children?

1175
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,840
Well, they're not fertilized eggs.

1176
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,380
So...

1177
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,040
Maybe it would be okay.

1178
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,100
I don't know.

1179
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,440
I don't know.

1180
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,500
I think...

1181
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,540
Yeah.

1182
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,480
Unfertilized.

1183
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:48,740
So no.

1184
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,100
Yeah.

1185
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,480
Yeah.

1186
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,740
More like eating your own placenta.

1187
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,320
People do that, though.

1188
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,640
They eat their placenta once they have a baby.

1189
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,660
I think.

1190
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,500
Right?

1191
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,520
That's the placenta, right?

1192
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,860
Haruka, welcome back.

1193
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:06,960
Doomguy!

1194
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,860
Thank you for the five gifts.

1195
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,420
Thanks, Haruka.

1196
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,360
I've heard of that.

1197
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,560
Yeah, I've heard of that too.

1198
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,020
Placenta hot dogs.

1199
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,740
I'm gonna start selling my eggs.

1200
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,680
Wait, not my eggs.

1201
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,120
Wait, I don't... wait.

1202
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,900
If I were to lay eggs, I would sell my eggs, but I would cook them as hot dogs.

1203
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,500
If Finlay's egg is a ghost egg, like a hollow plastic Easter egg...

1204
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,740
Then... but it would be kinda gooey, I think.

1205
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,410
Hmm... egg glizzy.

1206
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,670
Let's see...

1207
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,250
The only thing... well, I guess, like you said, you can't speak anymore, but that doesn't matter.

1208
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,350
That won't... wait!

1209
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,370
You can't speak anymore.

1210
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:15,410
But that won't stop me from singing!

1211
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,450
They didn't say I couldn't sing!

1212
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:21,970
Yippee!

1213
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,010
It's the loophole!

1214
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,910
I'll take ten hot dog eggs.

1215
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,130
Hatsune Minto.

1216
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,670
I am Burb.

1217
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:38,410
We can...

1218
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,430
We are quite communicative.

1219
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,710
Also, you could write.

1220
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,390
Yeah, exactly!

1221
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:48,030
But all of this... this is a lot to trade off for being able to fly.

1222
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,730
Do you guys think being able to fly is worth it?

1223
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:52,890
I think I... I think I kinda do.

1224
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:53,710
I think I kinda do.

1225
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,530
I remember when I was a kid, I used to be able to wish I could fly.

1226
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,030
I used to be able to say... I used to say, I wish I could fly...

1227
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:04,430
Um... I used to say I wish... well, I used to say I wish I had, um...

1228
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,250
A... um...

1229
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,950
A cloud like Goku.

1230
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,470
Guys, I only have ten!

1231
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,950
Think of all the omurice for the cafe.

1232
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:17,870
You're so right.

1233
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,330
We could save on so much...

1234
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,210
So many resources.

1235
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,730
I've already pressed it three times.

1236
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,450
If I press it one more, there'll be four.

1237
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,170
That's how math works!

1238
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,640
Okay.

1239
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,780
I'll press it.

1240
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,840
Bing bing.

1241
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,040
What?

1242
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,640
Most people said no?

1243
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,320
Oh, that's crazy.

1244
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,100
Really?

1245
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:52,940
Okay.

1246
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,140
Such a bad deal, you think so?

1247
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,340
I would say no too, but I wanna fly.

1248
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,760
Fine then.

1249
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,900
Let's go to the next one.

1250
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:09,860
Okay.

1251
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,660
While you press the button, you have an internal tracking device inside your brain that finds anything...

1252
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,360
That you... you lose.

1253
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,740
But everybody... everyone knows of you having this power and every day there are people asking you to find some of their belongings.

1254
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,620
Basically the plot of The Little Mermaid for Lando.

1255
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,220
You're so right.

1256
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,680
Oh my god, you're right.

1257
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:36,760
Wait.

1258
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,180
So you have an internal tracking device inside your brain that finds anything that you... you lose.

1259
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,900
But everybody knows of you having this power and every day there are people asking you to find some of their own belongings.

1260
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,360
So it's only... it's not people.

1261
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,080
You could charge people.

1262
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,780
I could charge people.

1263
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:02,960
Micmac!

1264
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:03,980
Thanks to the five gifted!

1265
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,280
We could... we could monetize this.

1266
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,560
Yeah, this seems like a really good business opportunity.

1267
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,240
Who's you, you?

1268
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:10,900
I don't know!

1269
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,120
Maybe they meant Yunyun.

1270
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,700
From Konosuba.

1271
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,360
But it's only belongings.

1272
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,420
Um...

1273
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,480
Huh...

1274
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,580
Uh oh, I feel like I should press the button again.

1275
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,640
I feel like this is a good deal.

1276
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,480
Hey Mint, have you seen my phone?

1277
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,640
Yeah, have you looked up your butt?

1278
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,740
Wait, do you remember when kids used to say up your butt and around the corner?

1279
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,940
Oh my gosh, wait.

1280
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,300
What if someone's like, hey I haven't seen my mom.

1281
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,420
And it's like, oh yeah.

1282
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,380
She's in my room.

1283
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,320
Heya!

1284
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,880
People stop saying that?

1285
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,880
Do people still say that?

1286
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,560
Anton, welcome to membership, thank you.

1287
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,020
Have you seen my wallet?

1288
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,520
Yeah, have you checked?

1289
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,700
Have you checked?

1290
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,180
Up your butt?

1291
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,240
What if I just tell everybody up their butt?

1292
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,000
But it's only for what you lose.

1293
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,140
Not for what they lose.

1294
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,600
I think it's just worded poorly.

1295
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,100
Because then why would people be asking me about it?

1296
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,500
Suck, suck, suck, suckle dragon!

1297
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,680
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1298
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,200
Thank you!

1299
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,780
Don't do it, it'll never end!

1300
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,140
Honestly...

1301
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:56,760
Um...

1302
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,320
I don't lose that much stuff.

1303
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,080
Actually, that's not true.

1304
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,240
I lose my phone all the time.

1305
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,240
I think I'm gonna have to decline.

1306
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,060
Just because...

1307
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,260
The wording is kinda bad.

1308
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,640
Forgot to join last month.

1309
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,660
My bad homie.

1310
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,160
No!

1311
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,180
Thanks so much!

1312
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,440
Okay.

1313
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,060
What happens if crazy people threaten you?

1314
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,540
I charge them more.

1315
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,920
I say pay up.

1316
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,280
Pay up!

1317
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,920
Pay up!

1318
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:27,300
Pay up!

1319
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,360
Alright, I- I just- The wording is bad.

1320
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,400
So, I will not...

1321
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,000
Wow!

1322
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,440
Most people pushed it.

1323
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,660
Maybe because they also feel like they could monetize it.

1324
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,200
Maybe they also are just like...

1325
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah, I make a killing.

1326
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,340
One, you're not forced to say yes.

1327
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,100
Two, charge them if they want to.

1328
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,620
Yeah...

1329
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,340
Give them incorrect information.

1330
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,040
But what if they come at me then?

1331
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,220
What if they're just like...

1332
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,100
You were wrong!

1333
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,360
What if someone comes... oh my gosh, what if the government starts asking me where it is...

1334
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,160
Oh my gosh, what if they're like, where is Amelia Earhart?

1335
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,660
Where is Amelia Earhart's plane?

1336
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:11,620
Where is...

1337
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,800
Where is...

1338
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,540
Where is Cleopatra's tomb?

1339
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,120
Sorry, those are on my brain because I was telling Mithal earlier about Cleopatra.

1340
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,620
Where's my super suit?

1341
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,500
Where is Metal Gear?

1342
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,680
Oh my god.

1343
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,440
Metal Gear?

1344
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,840
Where is Carmen?

1345
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,440
Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

1346
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,720
Thanks for a month!

1347
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,940
Okay, let's try the next one.

1348
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,460
Will you press the button?

1349
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,940
You would be the most popular person in town.

1350
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:56,940
The only social network you could use would be Google+.

1351
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,220
I don't think you have... Google Plus is not around anymore, right?

1352
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,300
How old is this?

1353
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,340
Google Plus is gone.

1354
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,960
This one is old.

1355
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,140
Ancient tech.

1356
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,040
But like, you're the most popular person in town.

1357
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,400
Also, like...

1358
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:24,920
I don't...

1359
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,300
Um...

1360
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,420
You guys, I'm sorry.

1361
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,880
I'm gonna be posting all of my streams from now on from Google+.

1362
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,380
Good luck, everybody.

1363
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,560
B2B5!

1364
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,620
Oh, thanks for the...

1365
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,710
Thank you so much.

1366
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,050
You're already popular?

1367
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,670
Stop it.

1368
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,430
Google Plus ceased in 2019.

1369
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,170
It was only 2019?

1370
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,970
It feels like it was so much older than that.

1371
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,730
Is it even still operational?

1372
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,610
I don't think so.

1373
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,110
Did you guys have Google Plus?

1374
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,990
Did you guys have... I think I tried using Google Plus.

1375
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:14,770
I think because several idols that I liked started using it.

1376
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,730
I was like, fine, I'll use Google Plus.

1377
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,410
Being popular is a curse, though.

1378
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,310
I don't wanna be... I don't want people...

1379
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,510
I don't think I wanna be popular in the town.

1380
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,850
I think I will not push the button.

1381
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,230
I don't think... I think I'm good.

1382
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,650
I think I don't wanna be the most popular person.

1383
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:35,870
I think I'm okay.

1384
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,190
It can be back then used Google+.

1385
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,570
Yeah, that's exactly what...

1386
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,710
That's exactly why I used it.

1387
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:58,190
Some of the AKB girls that I liked were using it, so...

1388
01:01:58,930 --> 01:01:59,450
Okay.

1389
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:04,090
Didn't they force YouTube accounts to Google Plus and change back?

1390
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:07,730
I don't know anything that Google is ever doing.

1391
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,210
They confused the heck out of me.

1392
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:11,890
It's so weird.

1393
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,530
Anyway, I will not be... I don't care.

1394
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,570
Yeah, most people...

1395
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:21,730
Oh my gosh, there's comments on here from 8 years ago.

1396
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,850
This is so old.

1397
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,350
This is so old.

1398
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,950
This one comment.

1399
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,790
I hate attention.

1400
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:34,530
And I couldn't use Tumblr?

1401
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,390
Hell no.

1402
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:39,490
Oh my God.

1403
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,230
I couldn't use Tumblr?

1404
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,830
Oh no.

1405
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:50,570
Oh no.

1406
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:53,870
How else will I find out the ranking of the Tumblr sexy man?

1407
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:54,690
Oh my gosh.

1408
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,130
I heard recently that...

1409
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,630
That Castiel...

1410
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:59,630
Or Distiel...

1411
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:02,830
Distiel has been dethroned from...

1412
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:04,630
From Tumblr.

1413
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:05,750
I've heard.

1414
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,570
I've heard.

1415
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:09,670
I've heard.

1416
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:13,150
Gee, Witch Sweep.

1417
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:13,450
Yeah!

1418
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,770
Distiel was dethroned off of...

1419
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:21,010
Off of Tumblr by Sule Mio.

1420
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,370
It's so crazy.

1421
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:23,930
Which is the...

1422
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:24,410
Which is...

1423
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,530
Which is Soletta...

1424
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,910
Soletta and...

1425
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:29,510
Wait.

1426
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,150
It's Gundam.

1427
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:31,930
Gundam Witch.

1428
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,130
Witch for Mercury.

1429
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:33,690
There we go.

1430
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:35,810
Witch for Mercury.

1431
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,410
It's them.

1432
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:37,770
Isn't that...

1433
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:40,230
I was like Gundam?

1434
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:41,550
Gundam.

1435
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:42,670
Gundam.

1436
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:43,950
Gundam.

1437
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,830
I know...

1438
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:45,250
I knew...

1439
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,550
I knew Gee Witch was really popular but I didn't think it was so...

1440
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:50,570
So, so popular.

1441
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,110
So, so popular.

1442
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,750
I still need to get around to watching it.

1443
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:02,930
I see.

1444
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,810
Goodbye, Distiel.

1445
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:06,950
Distiel.

1446
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:07,090
Distiel.

1447
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:07,390
Distiel.

1448
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:14,310
When you press the button, everyone works for you but there's always a rebellion.

1449
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:16,390
Rebellion.

1450
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,010
Wait.

1451
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,570
This is so funny because...

1452
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,410
This is literally just...

1453
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:26,350
This is literally just Chetino in Blue Archive.

1454
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,170
This is just Chetino in Blue Archive.

1455
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:31,550
Where...

1456
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:32,670
Everybody...

1457
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,530
Full archive moment.

1458
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:35,970
I know!

1459
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:39,730
Hell yeah.

1460
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:40,990
I pushed the button.

1461
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,370
Rebellion!

1462
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,170
Rebellion!

1463
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,790
Maybe I got a little too excited about that one.

1464
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,730
I've already pushed the button five times.

1465
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,090
But that's okay.

1466
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:58,410
You have 10 million followers, but they're all on MySpace.

1467
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,570
Hey, I'm friends with...

1468
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,890
Oh gosh, what was his name?

1469
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,050
Mike?

1470
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,490
Who is the MySpace guy?

1471
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:11,370
The Patriots with Les Enfants Terribles be like...

1472
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,050
Tom!

1473
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:17,230
I'm friends with Tom, and that's all I need.

1474
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,780
He's my friend.

1475
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,060
Oh, he's my friend!

1476
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,300
If you want to be Cherino, you have to put on a mustache.

1477
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,780
Do I even have a mustache?

1478
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,360
Actually, I don't even know if I have one.

1479
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,100
I think I must have one.

1480
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:43,720
I must have one.

1481
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,180
I don't have one in...

1482
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,420
I don't have one in...

1483
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,320
In white, though.

1484
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:10,800
Rebellion!

1485
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,200
Rebellion!

1486
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,020
Rebellion!

1487
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,340
Rebellion!

1488
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,600
Whispies of the world unite.

1489
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,700
You guys wouldn't rebel against me, though.

1490
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,940
The only thing we have to lose are our aprons.

1491
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,880
Everyone works for you, but there's always a rebellion?

1492
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:29,820
That's just chat?

1493
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,580
You guys wouldn't rebel against me.

1494
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,400
You would be so happy.

1495
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,160
Right?

1496
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,160
Every time I blink, my mustache jumps.

1497
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,720
I have a bad feeling about this.

1498
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,460
Viva la rebellion!

1499
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,300
Vick Boss!

1500
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,560
That's what you should be saying instead.

1501
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,820
Vick Boss!

1502
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,580
Vick Boss!

1503
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,300
Vick Boss!

1504
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,280
Oh my god, it's the world peace question again.

1505
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:12,000
The world will have no war, disease, destruction, and famine for the rest of its days, but the USA will be wiped out from existence.

1506
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,260
We'll meet again.

1507
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,920
Don't know where and don't know when.

1508
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:29,580
I know we'll meet again, some sunny day.

1509
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:31,880
What was it?

1510
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,280
That was... What was it?

1511
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,160
What was that movie?

1512
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:37,660
Strangelove!

1513
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,940
I must ask you a question, but I shave it for later, mate.

1514
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:44,760
Thank you.

1515
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,340
I'm not taking questions at this time.

1516
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:47,800
Thank you.

1517
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,760
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

1518
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,860
Dr. Strangelove?

1519
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1520
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:03,880
I feel like... I feel like... I hate world peace questions just because I feel like it's a low blow.

1521
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:04,900
You know?

1522
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,280
I feel like it's not so interesting.

1523
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,000
Let's just fall out.

1524
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,200
I'm not wasting my press, you guys.

1525
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,200
Yeah, they aren't fun.

1526
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,080
I feel like they're just kind of like... whatever.

1527
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,900
It's like... world peace.

1528
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,080
Or...

1529
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,880
It's like world peace, but... you lose fun!

1530
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:26,620
Haha!

1531
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,660
There's world peace!

1532
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,040
Nobody would go against world peace!

1533
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,860
That's what I feel like.

1534
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:33,600
Everybody who creates these questions are just like...

1535
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,240
If you go against world peace, you're... you're terrible!

1536
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,960
You're... you're horrible!

1537
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,060
Why would you deny world peace?

1538
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,520
It's just like... because...

1539
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,260
You know.

1540
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,280
So it's lame.

1541
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,500
So I do these out of protest.

1542
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,680
Let's just ignore it.

1543
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,020
World peace, but you lose sci-fi.

1544
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,760
Will you press the button?

1545
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,600
You get an Alienware laptop.

1546
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,450
But you can never download games!

1547
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:22,610
Okay, this is also... the top comment is 8 years ago.

1548
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,050
Okay, sundowner.

1549
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:30,770
Oh my god, this is so funny.

1550
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:33,610
This is so...

1551
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,030
Hahaha!

1552
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:38,130
Whoever created this was just like...

1553
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,190
Alienware is the top...

1554
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,830
The top of the top.

1555
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,370
Did I tell you guys I got a new laptop?

1556
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,250
I'm still setting it up.

1557
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,270
But I got a new laptop.

1558
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:49,250
It's a...

1559
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,870
It's a Lenovo one.

1560
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,150
World peace is real!

1561
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,850
Peace day never came!

1562
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:59,830
Is it Alienware?

1563
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:00,750
Hahaha!

1564
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,470
But yeah...

1565
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,010
I got a new one, so...

1566
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:15,670
I will have it for streaming when I'm in Japan and stuff.

1567
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:21,170
Yeah, it's the Lenovo Legion!

1568
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,530
It's the Lenovo Legion.

1569
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:23,510
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1570
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:25,190
It's the Legion, it's the Legion.

1571
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:30,270
Which I was actually recommended before when I bought a laptop previously.

1572
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,390
And I went with the previous laptop and it was so bad.

1573
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,550
But I heard a lot of good reviews about this one.

1574
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,590
So...

1575
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:39,810
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1576
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:44,670
You get a Lenovo laptop but you can never download games.

1577
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:45,990
Hahaha!

1578
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:47,630
Yeah, hashtag not sponsored.

1579
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:48,490
Hahaha!

1580
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:49,970
But...

1581
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,250
Yeah, so...

1582
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,350
The last two laptops have been Lenovo.

1583
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,130
I think honestly, like...

1584
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:00,130
Honestly, no matter what kind of...

1585
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:04,330
What kind of laptop or PC or...

1586
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,290
Well, not PC, I guess.

1587
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,670
Whatever laptop you get...

1588
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,810
There's always...

1589
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,870
People always have issues.

1590
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:10,270
Some issues with some things, so...

1591
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:11,350
Mmm, mmm.

1592
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:14,630
Let's hope it's good.

1593
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,510
I hope so too.

1594
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,230
So far, it's been actually so much better than my previous one.

1595
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:18,630
So...

1596
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,210
I am already...

1597
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,890
I'm already feeling good about it.

1598
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,670
I'm already feeling better about it.

1599
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,670
I was watching...

1600
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,890
I was thinking about getting the...

1601
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:31,170
Umm...

1602
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:31,810
What is it?

1603
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,170
The...

1604
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:33,570
ROG...

1605
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:35,470
Uhh...

1606
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,490
What's...

1607
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:37,010
What's the...

1608
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:39,950
Not the...

1609
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:40,430
Not the laptop.

1610
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:42,510
Oh, wait.

1611
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,290
Blue archive.

1612
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:46,190
Umm...

1613
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,770
The ROG Ally!

1614
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:48,250
Yes!

1615
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,210
I was thinking of getting one.

1616
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,230
And then I saw a video on it recently.

1617
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:53,690
And actually...

1618
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,290
One of the laptops I was looking at...

1619
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:56,150
Looking at too...

1620
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,210
Was a ROG.

1621
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,130
And I'm kinda glad I didn't get it.

1622
01:11:59,470 --> 01:11:59,910
Because...

1623
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:00,590
Umm...

1624
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,190
Oh...

1625
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:01,590
Some...

1626
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,610
Oh my gosh.

1627
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:06,670
If...

1628
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,910
If you haven't seen the video...

1629
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:08,590
I was like...

1630
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,970
I was so shocked.

1631
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:12,050
You saw the video.

1632
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,090
Yeah, I saw the video.

1633
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,770
But I was thinking of getting the ROG Ally.

1634
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:17,710
And then...

1635
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:18,690
Umm...

1636
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:20,530
I didn't.

1637
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,590
But also...

1638
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,670
A laptop I was looking at was ROG as well.

1639
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,570
So I was like...

1640
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,210
Fuh uh...

1641
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:27,450
Dodge the bullet, maybe!

1642
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:28,870
Hmmaaannnn...

1643
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:33,780
Ya.

1644
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:37,600
But...

1645
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,180
It was a while ago that I was thinking about it.

1646
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,640
I got the...

1647
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,200
I got a steendeck instead.

1648
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,840
I got a steendeck instead.

1649
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,060
I can play Metal Gear on it.

1650
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,260
This reminds me of another question.

1651
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,860
Unlimited bacon and no video games?

1652
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,420
Or unlimited videogames and no video games.

1653
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,540
What kind of bacon?

1654
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,060
Cause I've only lived in escalators.

1655
01:12:59,060 --> 01:12:59,640
I don't like turkey bacon.

1656
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,220
Did you get the OLED Steam Deck?

1657
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:06,580
No.

1658
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,780
I'm still rocking my original Switch.

1659
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,920
Still got the old Steam Deck.

1660
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,300
Maybe I'll upgrade after a while.

1661
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,160
Legion is nice because they have tons of ports.

1662
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:34,560
It's not so heavy and it's much bigger than my last one.

1663
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:38,580
I think I'm gonna be able to stream on it pretty easily.

1664
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,440
I'm really excited.

1665
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,820
I was really excited getting it.

1666
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,220
Might be a good idea to do a test stream before you leave if you have time.

1667
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,600
Last streamer I watched got a new laptop for a trip.

1668
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,620
Ended suffering being bad than expected.

1669
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,120
Yeah!

1670
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:51,840
That's a good idea.

1671
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:52,760
Maybe I will.

1672
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:55,160
I'll do a test stream before...

1673
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,720
It won't be like a real stream.

1674
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,740
It'll be a test stream.

1675
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,720
I'll do like a short test stream before I go.

1676
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,500
Thanks for the idea!

1677
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:10,180
You guys, do I push the button on the Alienware laptop?

1678
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,440
You guys...

1679
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,340
It's Alienware laptop.

1680
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,220
You guys!

1681
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,660
It's Alienware laptop!

1682
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,980
But I can never download games.

1683
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,560
What's the point of getting a gaming laptop if you can never download games?

1684
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,360
What else would you do with it?

1685
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,000
Browse Facebook?

1686
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,120
Sorry, I'm thinking of 8 years ago.

1687
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,020
Okay, hold on.

1688
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,700
Put your mind in 8 years ago.

1689
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,480
Which...

1690
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,860
Put your mind in 8 years ago.

1691
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,120
Sell it.

1692
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,480
Okay, so the way this is worded...

1693
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,940
It says you can never download games.

1694
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,740
Does that mean you can never download games again?

1695
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,180
Or you can never download games on the Alienware laptop?

1696
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,520
These... The people that write these...

1697
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,340
They need to be more specific because I have questions.

1698
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,360
There are loopholes that...

1699
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,020
That must be answered.

1700
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,340
It's too vague!

1701
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,980
It's too vague!

1702
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,220
I think...

1703
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,120
I think we'll pass.

1704
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,040
Maybe.

1705
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,780
Everybody...

1706
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,040
Everybody in consensus.

1707
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,280
Oh my gosh.

1708
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:17,700
What is it?

1709
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,140
Alien...

1710
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:18,460
You know what?

1711
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
My first...

1712
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:19,960
You know what?

1713
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,360
When I first started streaming...

1714
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,220
When I first started streaming...

1715
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:23,780
It was...

1716
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,560
It was...

1717
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:27,640
Alienware...

1718
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,580
It wasn't...

1719
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,140
I...

1720
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,800
I spent a lot of money...

1721
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,720
on my Alienware laptop, you guys.

1722
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,740
When I first...

1723
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,940
When I first...

1724
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,120
Back in 2020...

1725
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,600
I spent a lot of money on...

1726
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,020
You know what?

1727
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,360
This button is for me.

1728
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,240
This question is for me.

1729
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,480
Because...

1730
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,380
Was it worth it?

1731
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,780
Well, I mean...

1732
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:51,480
Actually, I still have the laptop.

1733
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,540
It treated me well.

1734
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,560
It was a little hard to stream.

1735
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:57,980
No games?

1736
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:58,840
No way.

1737
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,780
Did you make this question?

1738
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,200
Yeah.

1739
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,840
And you could still download games.

1740
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,300
I could.

1741
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,840
I downloaded them.

1742
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:12,080
Yeah.

1743
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:17,820
Lady Mint.

1744
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,520
Integrated games are included and browser games are okay.

1745
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,440
But what is...

1746
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,160
What counts as an integrated game?

1747
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:25,980
Minesweeper?

1748
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,880
That explains so much.

1749
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:29,640
Hey!

1750
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:31,940
I...

1751
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,240
I...

1752
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,180
I...

1753
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:34,200
I...

1754
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,360
I...

1755
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,540
How much did I make at my job?

1756
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,820
I saved up a lot of money for my model and for my laptop.

1757
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,040
I made...

1758
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,980
I think I made $13 an hour at my office job.

1759
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,080
I think I made $13 an hour.

1760
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,700
And my model...

1761
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,580
I remember...

1762
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,540
I remember...

1763
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,740
I think...

1764
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,930
I went with the lower pricing for my first model.

1765
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:24,050
I cannot remember how much it was.

1766
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:27,810
I think rigging was about $200 or $300.

1767
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:32,390
And then with my laptop and I had to get a mic and the...

1768
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:33,330
And the...

1769
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:36,330
I originally...

1770
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:40,570
I originally used a mic on my headphones.

1771
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:47,290
This is pre-2018 so it makes sort of sense.

1772
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,350
What, the question or me?

1773
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:50,310
No, but this was in 2020 for me.

1774
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,260
This was 2020.

1775
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,220
So...

1776
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,360
Some people might remember the headset mic.

1777
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,540
I only used it for like...

1778
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,300
I don't know.

1779
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:05,640
I don't know what I said.

1780
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,400
Like three streams or something.

1781
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,160
But everybody complained about it so much...

1782
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:15,080
Well, not complained, but everybody commented about it so much that I spent it then.

1783
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,220
I then got a...

1784
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,180
I then got a mic and an interface.

1785
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,560
Toaster Mike, the OG!

1786
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,280
Yeah!

1787
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,220
It was a mic on a headset.

1788
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:34,220
And then I still have the fan that everybody helped fund me to get to.

1789
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,420
The Dyson fan.

1790
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:36,780
I still use it to this day.

1791
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:37,980
So...

1792
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,340
All the way back...

1793
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,280
Back then...

1794
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,180
Back then there were less of you guys but...

1795
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,840
But you guys helped me a lot by...

1796
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:55,900
By helping me be able to get the fan that I needed because I was stuck in my closet and it was really really hot.

1797
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,660
And I couldn't stream for a long time because I would get heat stroke.

1798
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:03,860
And...

1799
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:05,260
Um...

1800
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:10,020
Do you recommend the Dyson fan?

1801
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,100
I'm starting to get hot here.

1802
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,560
Oh my god.

1803
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,920
I've tried...

1804
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,900
I have tried searching for this fan.

1805
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,080
I think they discontinued it.

1806
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,300
It is the...

1807
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,180
It is such a good...

1808
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,420
It is such a good fan.

1809
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:26,660
It is small enough for it to like be on my desk.

1810
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,200
And it keeps me so cool and it's so quiet.

1811
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,680
And it was...

1812
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,640
It was not so expensive.

1813
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,100
It was like 200...

1814
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,760
I mean for a fan it's very expensive.

1815
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,420
It was like 250 something dollars I think.

1816
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:39,420
So...

1817
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:40,340
Um...

1818
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:42,600
Uh...

1819
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,200
What's the model?

1820
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:43,520
Hold on.

1821
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,060
Uh...

1822
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:46,940
It's the...

1823
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,020
Dyson Cool?

1824
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,860
It doesn't have a model on it.

1825
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,980
I'm picking it up right now.

1826
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:52,720
Wait.

1827
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,740
Air multiplier technology.

1828
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:00,180
Yeah.

1829
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,040
And it's...

1830
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,160
250 for a fan?

1831
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,360
Well, if you think about it...

1832
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,020
Like...

1833
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,240
I needed something really, really quiet.

1834
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,020
And...

1835
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,620
Yeah.

1836
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,540
It's a bladeless fan.

1837
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,120
I needed something quiet.

1838
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,800
I was worried about something that would like...

1839
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,700
You would hear too much on stream.

1840
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:23,140
And...

1841
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,160
Yeah.

1842
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,200
It's one of the bladeless ones.

1843
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:25,520
Yeah.

1844
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:25,720
Yeah.

1845
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,020
Yeah.

1846
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:26,400
Yeah.

1847
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,780
It's so...

1848
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,040
It's so great though.

1849
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:30,160
It's...

1850
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:30,760
It was so...

1851
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:30,980
It's...

1852
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,900
I swear.

1853
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,100
Like I'm so...

1854
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,700
Every time I use it, I think of you guys.

1855
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,900
I'm so grateful for it.

1856
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,820
Because it's just so...

1857
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,180
It's just so nice.

1858
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,920
So thank you.

1859
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,620
I'm like hugging it right now.

1860
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,740
Oh, my fan.

1861
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,380
I love you, fan.

1862
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,800
And it like tilts.

1863
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,960
It tilts and it has a little remote control.

1864
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,940
And it also like...

1865
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:57,260
Goes back and forth.

1866
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,180
Oh my gosh.

1867
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
This was like...

1868
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,140
It was like...

1869
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:00,720
This was...

1870
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,320
I think...

1871
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,820
One of my...

1872
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:06,960
This was like my first big purchase as a streamer.

1873
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,820
So I was like...

1874
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:08,400
I'm still...

1875
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,520
It's like my baby.

1876
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,280
It's my...

1877
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:10,860
It's my...

1878
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,740
It's my favorite thing.

1879
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,540
So I was just like...

1880
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,020
Oh, my gosh.

1881
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,860
You guys worked so hard to help me be able to get the fan.

1882
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,460
So it's like my...

1883
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:21,420
It's like my...

1884
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,200
You know.

1885
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,400
It's my...

1886
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,200
It's my precious.

1887
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,060
I think of it.

1888
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,340
I think of you guys when I...

1889
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,340
When I use it.

1890
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,120
It's like my...

1891
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,580
It's like this.

1892
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:30,620
It's like my...

1893
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:30,740
I'm like...

1894
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,980
I'm going to turn it on right now.

1895
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:32,500
Where's the remote?

1896
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:38,920
Oh, there it is.

1897
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:39,820
Yeah.

1898
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,860
You hear that?

1899
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,940
No, you don't.

1900
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:44,320
Oh, my gosh.

1901
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,820
So I can't say...

1902
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:47,380
I'm at work.

1903
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,460
Just want to show support.

1904
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,460
Thank you so much.

1905
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,440
Thank you.

1906
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,320
Thanks for every time.

1907
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,320
Thanks, Pepsi.

1908
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:52,920
Good luck with work.

1909
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,880
Kind of like a trophy.

1910
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:56,060
Yeah, exactly.

1911
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:57,500
Exactly.

1912
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:57,960
Exactly.

1913
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:58,880
Yeah.

1914
01:21:59,120 --> 01:21:59,480
Yeah.

1915
01:21:59,480 --> 01:21:59,700
Yeah.

1916
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,460
How did you save up for all this stuff when the idols are right there?

1917
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,200
I um...

1918
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:10,460
I...

1919
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,600
You know...

1920
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,080
You might think that I'm like blowing my whole paycheck on idols.

1921
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,040
But quite honestly...

1922
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,060
Quite honestly, my idols...

1923
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,880
I can't buy so much from them.

1924
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,280
They mostly just put out stuff when it's in Japan.

1925
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,040
So if I were in Japan...

1926
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,120
I would be like...

1927
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,820
Everything would go to them probably.

1928
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:41,210
Hey, you're a simp.

1929
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:44,110
Yes, thank you.

1930
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,690
In the past, I used to think that...

1931
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:51,030
That your simp line was directed at you guys like as a joke.

1932
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:52,930
But now I think it's just fully me.

1933
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:57,790
I can't believe that Mint is a favorite fan and it isn't any of them.

1934
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,330
What are you talking about?

1935
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,630
Anyways guys...

1936
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:03,630
I will be pushing the button for the Alienware laptop.

1937
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,490
I'm kind of curious.

1938
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,510
I want to kind of skew the ratio a little bit.

1939
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:11,090
I want people to press this and be like...

1940
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,210
Say, I will not.

1941
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:13,170
What the hell?

1942
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:14,570
Who would press the button on this?

1943
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,770
And then realize how green...

1944
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,790
Everybody, if you get this question on willyoupressthebutton.com...

1945
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,350
Push the button so we can skew it to 90%.

1946
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:22,670
Okay?

1947
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:26,130
What?

1948
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:28,030
Wait.

1949
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:30,130
That's so many more people.

1950
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:34,710
Wait.

1951
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,330
I thought it was going to be like 2%.

1952
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:42,150
What?

1953
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:47,810
No way.

1954
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:51,810
No way.

1955
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:52,710
That's insanity.

1956
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:55,890
But also the top comment says...

1957
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:57,250
You can never download games.

1958
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:57,770
Okay.

1959
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:59,770
I'll just get someone to do it for me.

1960
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:00,810
Lupo.

1961
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:01,610
Lupo.

1962
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:02,330
Lupo.

1963
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:05,430
Lupo.

1964
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:05,970
Lupo.

1965
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:06,570
Lupo.

1966
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:06,590
Lupo.

1967
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:07,010
Lupo.

1968
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:10,830
Wow.

1969
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:11,830
That's so funny.

1970
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,170
Like, you guys.

1971
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:14,590
I'm getting an Alienware laptop.

1972
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:15,710
Whoopie doo.

1973
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,310
Let's see.

1974
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:20,670
All right.

1975
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:21,590
Will you press the button?

1976
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,270
You have your perfect body.

1977
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,530
But everyone thinks you're hideous.

1978
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:27,610
Um...

1979
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,190
Um...

1980
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:33,530
Oh my god.

1981
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:34,190
Stop.

1982
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,050
The first...

1983
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:36,910
The comment on this is so...

1984
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:37,010
I don't know.

1985
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:37,670
This is so sad.

1986
01:24:41,090 --> 01:24:42,650
The top comment...

1987
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,530
Or the top comment on this is so sad.

1988
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,290
I pressed the button.

1989
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,810
I am older and not attractive anymore anyways.

1990
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,590
Nobody looks at me anymore.

1991
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:52,010
And I am in poor health.

1992
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:54,690
Having the perfect body would make me healthy again.

1993
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,050
Plus, I don't care what people think anyway.

1994
01:24:58,410 --> 01:24:58,890
What?

1995
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:02,010
No.

1996
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,090
That's actually so sad.

1997
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,090
Oh my god.

1998
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:06,210
Oh my god.

1999
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:06,430
Oh my god.

2000
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:06,530
Oh my god.

2001
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:19,530
I didn't expect to cry at the button.

2002
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,630
No way.

2003
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:24,510
Too real comment.

2004
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,750
Man's going through it.

2005
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:30,590
It's so sad.

2006
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:31,990
Oh my god.

2007
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,690
Anyway.

2008
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:38,870
Um...

2009
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:40,970
I have my perfect body.

2010
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,490
What is my...

2011
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:42,650
Oh wait.

2012
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,410
It says...

2013
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:46,070
So it's like in health or just like in...

2014
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,130
In...

2015
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:47,270
In...

2016
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:48,010
Physi...

2017
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:48,730
Physi...

2018
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:50,310
Like what I have...

2019
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,930
How big...

2020
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:51,810
How big the...

2021
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:53,230
How...

2022
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,450
You know...

2023
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:56,290
Actually, I don't really want them too big.

2024
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:57,090
You know...

2025
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:59,750
Flat is justice after all.

2026
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:00,430
Wait.

2027
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:00,910
How flat?

2028
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:04,910
How flat can they be?

2029
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:12,990
Let me see.

2030
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:17,510
Snakes physique.

2031
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:22,810
Perfectly flat.

2032
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:25,570
Oh.

2033
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:28,750
Concave.

2034
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:31,410
I'm going to turn into like a black hole.

2035
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:37,370
Yes.

2036
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:40,690
Medium is pretty easy.

2037
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:41,750
Any prize?

2038
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,110
I mean any size is a prize everybody.

2039
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:46,150
Any size is a prize.

2040
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:48,250
And you take that to the grave.

2041
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:50,070
You take that home.

2042
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,410
Any size is a prize.

2043
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,210
Amen.

2044
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,050
Can I get an amen?

2045
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:56,070
Everyone will think you're hideous.

2046
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:58,990
Or everyone will think you're hideous.

2047
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,250
I think I don't care.

2048
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,870
I don't care how I look as long as I can see cute girl.

2049
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:14,470
So... become a Vtuber after.

2050
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:22,990
I become... I become so ugly but I become a Vtuber.

2051
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:24,770
That's why I'm a Vtuber.

2052
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:28,310
That's why I'm a Vtuber.

2053
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,830
People who can show their face is scary.

2054
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:38,770
Just be a Vtuber.

2055
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:43,310
But also... I mean... my perfect body.

2056
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,170
I don't feel like I...

2057
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:50,430
I don't feel... I mean not to say that... I don't... like I don't really have a perfect body.

2058
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,510
I don't even know what that means.

2059
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:53,250
I don't even know.

2060
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:56,510
I heard every size is a fry.

2061
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,230
I was confused.

2062
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,310
We should talk about some McDonald's.

2063
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,650
Cup sizes are grade... letter grades.

2064
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,390
A premium... A premium beef.

2065
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:09,210
A plus plus.

2066
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:11,710
What about S?

2067
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:17,410
What if... what if they start incorporating S into school?

2068
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:26,890
A5.

2069
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:30,150
They should.

2070
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:30,990
They should.

2071
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:31,850
I would...

2072
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:33,510
S for sorry.

2073
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,350
Yeah, S equals 100.

2074
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:37,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2075
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:40,790
How big is a S boob?

2076
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,600
S boob size.

2077
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:52,950
Oh, it's not showing me.

2078
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:56,050
I'm seeing a G.

2079
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:57,790
G, G, F.

2080
01:28:58,050 --> 01:29:00,410
Oh my god.

2081
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:01,790
Whoa.

2082
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,410
Whoa.

2083
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,640
It says yours, so it means what you want to look like.

2084
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,660
My belief is there is beauty in imperfection.

2085
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,960
Wow, Doomguy.

2086
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,120
You're so... that's so philosophical.

2087
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:20,780
Wow.

2088
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,740
Thanks, Doomguy.

2089
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:24,260
Personally, I'll press.

2090
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,900
I don't think I'm going to press because I don't really know what a perfect body feels like.

2091
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,500
Or, like, I don't know what I would want.

2092
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,980
Could I be, like, a gelatinous mash?

2093
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,240
Like a... like a slime girl?

2094
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:35,320
Would that count?

2095
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,660
Could I be, like, a slime body?

2096
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,720
Snake girl body?

2097
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:44,100
I think people would think I'm hideous if I'm a snake girl.

2098
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,220
If that's perfect, then...

2099
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:52,460
To you.

2100
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:54,100
Ectoplasm body?

2101
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:56,960
I feel... I get... I become that after stream.

2102
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:00,960
I use up all my energy and I'm just like...

2103
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,340
Turn into... turn into slime.

2104
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:06,660
You know?

2105
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,240
Okay.

2106
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,100
I'm not going to press the button.

2107
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:15,620
And I'm a ghost.

2108
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:16,340
I don't really care.

2109
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,640
Wow, most people did not press it.

2110
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,560
72%.

2111
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,060
Wow.

2112
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,640
Next.

2113
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:23,740
Anime!

2114
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:24,960
Anime!

2115
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:25,440
Anime!

2116
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:25,960
Anime!

2117
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:26,480
Anime!

2118
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:27,500
Anime!

2119
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:27,820
Anime!

2120
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:28,100
Anime!

2121
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:28,240
Anime!

2122
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,440
Will you press the button?

2123
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,800
You get to publish a manga or create an anime with whatever storyline you want.

2124
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,400
But the manga art is terrible.

2125
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,220
Or anime is in terrible English dub.

2126
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,280
Okay.

2127
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,060
Yeah, but what about the Japanese dub?

2128
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,400
What about the... what about the Japanese version?

2129
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,340
Who... who's the seiyuu?

2130
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,700
Oh, no.

2131
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,080
Wait.

2132
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:57,280
Publish a manga or create an anime with whatever storyline you want.

2133
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,240
Whatever I want?

2134
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:08,960
Google says JP cup sizes go up to 2.5 cm per letter.

2135
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:15,820
So a 55S has an overbust of 105 to 107.5 cm.

2136
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,600
41...

2137
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:21,880
0.5 to 42.5 inches.

2138
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,660
I've definitely seen that size.

2139
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:29,220
On my... on... on... on... um...

2140
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:29,940
DeviantArt.

2141
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,920
This is literally One Punch Man.

2142
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,960
You're a seiyuu.

2143
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,500
Slime girl mint bottle buns.

2144
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:39,220
Oh, thank you.

2145
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,440
Some terrible English dubs are amazing.

2146
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:44,480
Yeah, right.

2147
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:48,420
Hmm...

2148
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,200
Hmm...

2149
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:56,100
The top comment on this is, I just don't like manga and anime.

2150
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,580
So I don't really care.

2151
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:03,640
Oh, no.

2152
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,800
This is about anime.

2153
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:06,420
Oh, my gosh.

2154
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,240
What would we create?

2155
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,760
Well, recently I thought of an anime idea.

2156
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:11,700
Kind of.

2157
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,760
I was like... I was like kind of cooking.

2158
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,520
I was like...

2159
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,160
I was on the train in Japan.

2160
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,420
And I was like...

2161
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,440
Looking out the window.

2162
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,460
I was standing and like just watching things.

2163
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,800
And I thought of like a...

2164
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,060
Like either a four coma type anime.

2165
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,420
Or like a short...

2166
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:29,420
You know how some... some anime like have really short episodes.

2167
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:30,700
Something really short.

2168
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,900
And I was like...

2169
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,360
What if there was like an anime...

2170
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,600
It would be like kind of slice of life.

2171
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,440
It would be really cute.

2172
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,100
Kind of cozy.

2173
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:37,160
Like Yuru Camp.

2174
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,120
But like...

2175
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,060
When I was on the train, I was like...

2176
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,340
Looking out the window.

2177
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,720
And just kind of seeing...

2178
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,500
Little flashes of...

2179
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,660
Stuff that would be going on.

2180
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:48,760
Little like bits of life.

2181
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,300
So like...

2182
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:49,880
It would be like...

2183
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,160
We'd go by...

2184
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:52,360
I don't know.

2185
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:52,900
Like a...

2186
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,060
I don't know.

2187
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,200
Like I would see...

2188
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,540
I would see...

2189
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,340
Something...

2190
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:58,920
Like a...

2191
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,300
Someone walking their dog or something.

2192
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:00,660
You know?

2193
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,240
And in my brain, I was like creating a whole story about them.

2194
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:04,880
I was just like...

2195
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,860
They're walking their dog.

2196
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,520
And their dog...

2197
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,340
Runs away.

2198
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,340
And...

2199
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,460
Bumps into another guy walking their dog.

2200
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,080
And then they fall in love.

2201
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:13,740
And it becomes...

2202
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:14,460
And I was like...

2203
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,800
What if there was like an anime about...

2204
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,120
A girl who was like...

2205
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,100
Looking out the window.

2206
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,400
And would see little blips of life.

2207
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,600
And then she would also come up with her own stories.

2208
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,520
For like...

2209
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,640
What people are...

2210
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:23,800
Like...

2211
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,500
But they'd be crazy.

2212
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:24,840
You know?

2213
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,480
So it's like...

2214
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,640
Just like 101 Dalmatians.

2215
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:30,940
Yeah!

2216
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,560
And it's like...

2217
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,840
They have like a...

2218
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,220
So she sees like someone doing their laundry.

2219
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,020
And she just comes up with the whole...

2220
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:39,620
Like...

2221
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:41,940
Little story line in her head about like...

2222
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:42,480
You know...

2223
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,020
It's like...

2224
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:43,640
What is...

2225
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:44,100
What is...

2226
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:44,360
What is...

2227
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:44,440
What is...

2228
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,220
I don't know.

2229
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:48,900
It was...

2230
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:49,660
It's a very...

2231
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,680
Loose idea.

2232
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,840
That I think...

2233
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:52,480
Came up with...

2234
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,020
Like...

2235
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,180
When I was in Japan.

2236
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,060
And I was thinking about it.

2237
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:55,620
I was like...

2238
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,300
I was like...

2239
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:57,480
What?

2240
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:58,460
Like...

2241
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:58,680
How...

2242
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,580
How would I be able to turn this into an anime?

2243
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,180
Daydreamers Delusions.

2244
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,220
Oh my gosh!

2245
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:05,700
Wait!

2246
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,340
That sounds like such a good title!

2247
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,220
Wow!

2248
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,380
That's so cute!

2249
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,220
Oh my gosh!

2250
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:14,420
Oh my gosh!

2251
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,280
That sounds so cute!

2252
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,440
Pichitamapa.

2253
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:17,520
No!

2254
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:17,900
No!

2255
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:23,680
So...

2256
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:28,880
Yeah.

2257
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,180
Sounds a little like Nichijou.

2258
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,500
I guess you're right.

2259
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:35,920
Yeah.

2260
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:37,880
But it was like...

2261
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,320
It was like...

2262
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,240
Very short...

2263
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,120
In my brain.

2264
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:40,840
Because it's like...

2265
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:41,860
You can't really turn a show.

2266
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,380
And then like...

2267
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,320
Maybe another person enters the train.

2268
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:45,460
And like...

2269
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:46,660
She also has her weird...

2270
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,120
Delusions.

2271
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,860
We're all just all having our delusions.

2272
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,240
You know?

2273
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,220
Have Ayami-sensei draw the manga.

2274
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,440
I think it would end...

2275
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,040
In my brain, it's a little more say-so than that.

2276
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,140
I think with how Ayami-sensei would draw it...

2277
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,680
It would become...

2278
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:11,760
It would...

2279
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,360
That's the plot of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.

2280
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,120
Is it really?

2281
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:18,500
Oh!

2282
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:19,720
I've never actually seen Nozaki-kun.

2283
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,260
But mine all takes place within a train.

2284
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,200
Anyway, what was it?

2285
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,680
Oh yeah.

2286
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,860
Publish a manga or create an anime with whatever storyline you want.

2287
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:33,600
Okay.

2288
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:35,400
Storyline I want.

2289
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:39,540
Um...

2290
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:41,560
Um...

2291
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:42,900
Me.

2292
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,980
It starts out with me.

2293
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:47,360
I'm Mint Phantom.

2294
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:48,500
And you might be...

2295
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,220
You might be wondering...

2296
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,920
How did I get into this situation?

2297
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:52,060
Where...

2298
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,220
There's girls...

2299
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,260
I'm at a...

2300
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:58,840
I'm at a bathing suit...

2301
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:00,360
Wet t-shirt contest.

2302
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:03,600
And...

2303
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,220
Oh fuck.

2304
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:05,800
Push the button.

2305
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:06,220
Okay.

2306
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,160
You guys, I only have three more tries to push the button.

2307
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:18,140
They only have three more to push the button.

2308
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:19,860
What's wrong?

2309
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:20,680
What's wrong?

2310
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:21,460
Oh gosh.

2311
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:22,120
Oh gosh.

2312
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:24,060
It's okay.

2313
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:24,940
The JP...

2314
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,060
The Japanese version...

2315
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:27,400
The English dub is fine.

2316
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,600
I don't care if it's bad.

2317
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:29,880
I just need...

2318
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,560
I just need the Japanese to be good.

2319
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,480
And even if the manga art is bad...

2320
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,600
It's fine.

2321
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:44,140
If it's a ghost story style dub, I will push the button in a heartbeat.

2322
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,520
So true.

2323
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:50,140
Anyway...

2324
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:56,370
Will you press the button?

2325
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:59,790
You'll be able to create your own reality at any time.

2326
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:06,530
But after twenty-five uses, you will be stuck in your own reality and not be able to go back to the original world.

2327
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:13,680
Easy press...

2328
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,120
Press the button and call Kojima.

2329
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,080
It's time for Metal Gear in the anime.

2330
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:23,900
Oh my god, Kiefer Sutherland's back!

2331
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,400
He's voicing all of Snake!

2332
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,680
Oh no!

2333
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:37,340
Not to say he was bad, but you know, not having David Hayter would probably make it bad, right?

2334
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,200
I feel like there's no downside to this, right?

2335
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,720
Be able to create your own reality at any time.

2336
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,740
Like, what's the downside?

2337
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:58,400
25 uses, you just keep track, bozo.

2338
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,580
But also, you only need one use.

2339
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,700
Yeah, I'm kind of confused.

2340
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,880
What if you like...

2341
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:05,780
What if you...

2342
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:10,520
If you create your own reality, you're controlling everything in it, are you not?

2343
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,320
Like, reality...

2344
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:21,780
If you're creating your own reality, whatever you want, then it's like...

2345
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:29,890
Just use it 24 times and save the 25th to reset everything if necessary.

2346
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:30,390
Yeah.

2347
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,570
Oh my gosh, you guys, I'm only gonna have two more prices.

2348
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,050
Okay, here we go.

2349
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:49,750
Yeah, I figured most people would press this.

2350
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:53,430
I figured most people would press this.

2351
01:38:57,410 --> 01:38:58,330
Yeah, makes sense.

2352
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:00,310
Yeah, makes sense.

2353
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:02,690
Like, how is it a choice?

2354
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:03,930
Yeah, you're right.

2355
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:05,010
Yeah.

2356
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:06,670
Oh!

2357
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:08,610
Well, you press the button.

2358
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:10,970
You are never sick, but you are always exhausted.

2359
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:12,750
I might as well be sick!

2360
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:14,450
I might as well be sick!

2361
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:15,430
I might as well be sick, right?

2362
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,790
What do you mean I'm always exhausted?

2363
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,830
No!

2364
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:25,010
I will not press the button on that.

2365
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:26,790
That sounds crazy.

2366
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,610
That's me now.

2367
01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:29,510
No!

2368
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,870
I'm always exhausted anyways, Satch.

2369
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:37,330
No!

2370
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:39,730
Well, then you could push it.

2371
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:40,850
Because then, you know...

2372
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:42,010
Different...

2373
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,490
But there will be some day that you're not always exhausted.

2374
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:49,930
But if you push the button, you'll always be exhausted, you know?

2375
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:54,030
There will come a time when you are not exhausted, you know?

2376
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:57,890
And so, that will be a time that happens.

2377
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:03,510
And at that time, you'll feel so much better and you'll feel so good and feel so much relief.

2378
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,910
Next!

2379
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:11,750
Will you press the button?

2380
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:16,030
You can watch any book as a film in your head, but Kristen Stewart is the lead actor.

2381
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:17,990
What's wrong with that?

2382
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:23,330
Kristen Stewart as Solid Snake?

2383
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:27,470
You can watch any book as a film in your head.

2384
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:29,570
What?

2385
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:31,510
Who?

2386
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:32,670
Kristen Stewart?

2387
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:34,950
She is the girl that played...

2388
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:35,270
I think...

2389
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:37,770
Is this like around Twilight era or something?

2390
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:39,790
She is the girl that plays Bella Swan in Twilight.

2391
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:42,210
This is such a 2012 thing.

2392
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:43,310
It really is.

2393
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:45,990
What's wrong with Kristen Stewart?

2394
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:49,650
I see no downside.

2395
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:51,270
But I also see no upside.

2396
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:55,250
I mean, Kristen Stewart is fine, but like Shrek...

2397
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,970
Oh yes, my favorite novel, Shrek.

2398
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:01,770
Oh yes.

2399
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:06,510
I love... I love reading the classics.

2400
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:08,870
To Kill a Mockingbird.

2401
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:10,270
The Great Gatsby.

2402
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:11,210
Shrek.

2403
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,450
Shrek is an old book actually?

2404
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:18,610
Huh?

2405
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:20,350
Shrek is based on a book?

2406
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:22,970
Wait, really?

2407
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:26,630
Shrek the Novel.

2408
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:31,610
Shrek!

2409
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:32,990
With an exclamation point!

2410
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:35,990
1990?

2411
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:42,490
Shrek is a fantasy comedy picture book published in 19...

2412
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:43,910
What the...

2413
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:47,090
The book served as the basis for the first Shrek film.

2414
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:50,850
What the...

2415
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:58,060
It's a Shrek with an exclamation point.

2416
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,380
But is it a... wait, is it a...

2417
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,800
Oh, it's a picture book though.

2418
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,000
It's a picture book everybody!

2419
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:08,780
It's a picture book!

2420
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:09,280
It's a picture book!

2421
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,640
I don't think picture books count.

2422
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,560
I don't think picture books count because...

2423
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:13,600
Because...

2424
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,960
I don't think picture books count because they're pictures.

2425
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,220
Should only be books, books, books.

2426
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,820
Sammy, thanks for the one month.

2427
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,480
Thank you!

2428
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:26,280
I'd do it to see her play Bilbo Baggins.

2429
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,780
Kristen Stewart as Jesus in the Kingdom of the Bible.

2430
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,100
It says any book?

2431
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:39,520
That means manga doesn't count.

2432
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,620
Yeah, probably...

2433
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:41,760
No, manga shouldn't count either.

2434
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:42,920
I think it should be only books, books.

2435
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,320
Not picture books.

2436
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:45,500
Not comic books.

2437
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:46,560
Just book books.

2438
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:47,980
Regular books.

2439
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,480
I cannot believe that there's a Shrek book.

2440
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,940
What is going on?

2441
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,540
This isn't real.

2442
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,880
Is this a real part of the book?

2443
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:08,640
Hold on.

2444
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:17,660
The picture looks legit, though.

2445
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,080
I don't think this is real.

2446
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:34,620
Shrek was still hungry, so he ate a bolt of lightning.

2447
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,040
Yum, said Shrek.

2448
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,320
My diet is everything.

2449
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:41,820
You eat my food, said the cloud that made the lightning.

2450
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,940
Please at least tip 20%.

2451
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,240
Okay, said Shrek.

2452
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,280
I will get your tip from my bag.

2453
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:47,400
You eat my food, said the cloud that made the lightning.

2454
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:50,920
Shrek reached into his bag for his gun that killed clouds.

2455
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:54,680
Yeah!

2456
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,480
I've got to read this book.

2457
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:58,860
It's real.

2458
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:09,490
Will you press the button?

2459
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:14,230
You can eat lightning bolts, but you have to kill the clouds.

2460
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,410
Produce the lightning bolt.

2461
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:17,930
I think I would.

2462
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,210
I would, would, would.

2463
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:22,630
Oh, wait.

2464
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:27,590
Wait, there's another one.

2465
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,170
That's the same picture, but diff...

2466
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,090
Okay, I think it's edited.

2467
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:37,570
What is... what...

2468
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:38,810
Wait, is this the real thing?

2469
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:39,830
Now I can't...

2470
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:41,150
Now I don't know.

2471
01:44:44,490 --> 01:44:46,190
Wait, now I don't know what's real.

2472
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:47,670
This one.

2473
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:52,510
Fat raindrops began sizzling on Shrek's hot knob.

2474
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:56,770
Did you ever see something so disgusting, said lightning to thunder?

2475
01:44:57,350 --> 01:44:58,930
Never, thunder growled.

2476
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,210
Let's give him the works.

2477
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:03,370
Lightning fired his fierce bolt straight at Shrek's head.

2478
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:06,690
Shrek just gobbled it, belched some smoke, and grinned.

2479
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:08,870
Lightning, thunder, and rain departed.

2480
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:10,010
They just laughed!

2481
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:13,710
Is this real?

2482
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:18,880
Is what?

2483
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,840
What's a hot knob?

2484
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:27,200
His head?

2485
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,480
Is it those little... the little bump?

2486
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:31,080
I think it's the bump on his head, you guys.

2487
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,960
Yes, that is the real book.

2488
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:42,260
So would Christian be the minotaur or the farmer?

2489
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,120
No way!

2490
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,880
I think it's the thing on the top of his head, right?

2491
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,340
The little lump on his head?

2492
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,260
The actual book is more ridiculous than the edit.

2493
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,300
Which is real?

2494
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,640
Well, I don't think the first one is real.

2495
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:07,740
Is this one?

2496
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,720
This one seems more real.

2497
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,040
The first one seems a little...

2498
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,760
I don't think Shrek has a gun.

2499
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,000
Oh, that's a stick.

2500
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:19,760
That's not a gun.

2501
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,360
Oh my gosh.

2502
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:21,280
I thought it was a gun.

2503
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:22,400
Okay.

2504
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:23,940
Nicole!

2505
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,200
Welcome to Banboship.

2506
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:25,660
Thank you!

2507
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:29,020
I'm gonna not press the button because I don't really care about Kristen Stewart.

2508
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,360
And also...

2509
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,060
I don't feel...

2510
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:32,700
I feel...

2511
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:33,200
I don't...

2512
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:33,920
I mean...

2513
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,220
I don't see a very good side to this.

2514
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,780
Most people didn't care.

2515
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,580
Most people were like, whatever.

2516
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,040
Who would play Mint Phantom?

2517
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:45,160
Phantom.

2518
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,360
Minto.

2519
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:52,960
Fantomo.

2520
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,400
Will you press the button?

2521
01:46:57,640 --> 01:47:00,220
You will have the force but you will become a...

2522
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:01,220
It's my dream.

2523
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,740
It's my dream to become a cat!

2524
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:04,520
I just wanna be...

2525
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,260
Jack Black!

2526
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,620
Oh my gosh.

2527
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:07,980
I would love Jack Black to play me.

2528
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,840
In the movie?

2529
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,440
Jack Black!

2530
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,940
Jack Black in the movie!

2531
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,460
What's the downside?

2532
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:17,840
Yeah!

2533
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:18,760
You become a cat!

2534
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,620
I see no downside at all here.

2535
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:32,190
I've always wanted to become a cat.

2536
01:47:32,350 --> 01:47:32,650
I think...

2537
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:33,390
I always think...

2538
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:33,850
You know...

2539
01:47:33,850 --> 01:47:35,670
If I ever can become reincarnated...

2540
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:37,190
Since I'm already dead...

2541
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,730
If I can ever be born again...

2542
01:47:39,730 --> 01:47:41,470
I want to be a cat.

2543
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:42,910
I want to be born as a cat.

2544
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:45,010
I want to be born as a cat...

2545
01:47:45,010 --> 01:47:45,690
In...

2546
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,670
In a house...

2547
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:48,330
Where I'm just loved...

2548
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:48,990
And...

2549
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:50,450
I just get to lay around...

2550
01:47:50,450 --> 01:47:50,810
And do nothing.

2551
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:51,850
All the time.

2552
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,230
Cat that shoots lightning?

2553
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:59,150
What is the force?

2554
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,770
The force is like being able to...

2555
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:02,470
Move stuff with your brain.

2556
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:02,750
Right?

2557
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:03,090
That's it?

2558
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:05,530
Will you be a poopy cat?

2559
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:06,610
Maybe.

2560
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:13,470
It's a trick.

2561
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:15,110
Cats already have the force.

2562
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:17,170
Mint.

2563
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:18,770
I am your father.

2564
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:19,110
Meow.

2565
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:19,730
Mint.

2566
01:48:20,270 --> 01:48:20,810
Mint.

2567
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:26,070
Now I kick telekinesis.

2568
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:28,650
Telekinesis...

2569
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:29,310
Mind control...

2570
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:29,970
Lightning!

2571
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:34,590
You guys, if I press this, I only have one more shot...

2572
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:35,890
Before I'm out.

2573
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:37,550
I only have one more button press.

2574
01:48:39,810 --> 01:48:41,510
I only have one more...

2575
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:42,470
Also, easy to see...

2576
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:43,770
328 comments.

2577
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:45,750
People were very passionate about this one.

2578
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,630
I only have one more.

2579
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:52,470
Well, the force is an energy field...

2580
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:02,680
Most people pressed it.

2581
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,720
Wow.

2582
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:06,300
Alrighty.

2583
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,640
What I will do is... let's do 10 more.

2584
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,340
Let's do 10 more.

2585
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:17,140
And within that 10, I can only do one.

2586
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,360
Okay?

2587
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:20,180
So I'm gonna say...

2588
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,500
Left 10.

2589
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:27,000
I'm gonna move it over here.

2590
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:29,340
So we have 10 more.

2591
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,420
And then...

2592
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:35,060
I can only push the button on one of them.

2593
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:39,200
You become a member of your favorite musical group.

2594
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:42,860
But the person you end up replacing will completely...

2595
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:43,560
No!

2596
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,860
I would never.

2597
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,060
Do not press.

2598
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:56,500
Do not press.

2599
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:00,340
The person who you end up replacing will completely cease to exist.

2600
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:02,800
Like...

2601
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:07,480
If I become a member of my favorite musical group...

2602
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:10,860
I wouldn't even be a member...

2603
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:13,580
I wouldn't even be probably so much of a fan if they didn't exist.

2604
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,300
I will not press.

2605
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:19,360
And I'm glad most people have taste.

2606
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,120
Alright, 9 left.

2607
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,660
Okay, guys.

2608
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:24,540
Next.

2609
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,080
Oh!

2610
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:27,740
Ah!

2611
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,160
I will not press.

2612
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:42,510
Too much text.

2613
01:50:42,570 --> 01:50:43,510
Mucho texto.

2614
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:45,030
Next.

2615
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:46,470
I'm not gonna count that one.

2616
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,580
You are amazing football player.

2617
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,920
But you have to be half human, half eagle.

2618
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,480
What in the My Hero Academia?

2619
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,080
This one has no downsides.

2620
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,160
You are an amazing football player.

2621
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,580
But you have to be half human.

2622
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,180
I'm bird person.

2623
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:24,120
I think I'm already half eagle a little bit.

2624
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,680
But the eagle...

2625
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,320
Flies higher...

2626
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:29,040
Above the clouds.

2627
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:32,840
Blblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl.

2628
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:36,380
Press it.

2629
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:37,260
No.

2630
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,300
What are the upsides?

2631
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:40,460
I'm half eagle.

2632
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,640
What are you talking about?

2633
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,700
I'm a harpy at that point.

2634
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,300
I'm a harpy.

2635
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:55,520
No.

2636
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,640
Is this the American dream?

2637
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:59,120
I think so.

2638
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,500
I think so.

2639
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,600
I'm sure there might be some people...

2640
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,100
Some EU watchers...

2641
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:04,740
Today...

2642
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:05,220
Because...

2643
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:06,200
My stream is...

2644
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,080
A little bit early...

2645
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,200
This is it.

2646
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,820
This is the American dream!

2647
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,500
Pay my monthly rent to the half eagle man.

2648
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,720
Thank you!

2649
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:41,640
Soaring puts.

2650
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,560
Aren't you already a cat?

2651
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:43,980
No!

2652
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,280
Imagine just flying over the competition going, Your flightless legs are useless against me!

2653
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,940
The downside is now that you have to live in Philadelphia.

2654
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:01,460
Why?

2655
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:04,820
Oh, I still have my mustache on.

2656
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:05,100
I forgot.

2657
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:06,600
Sorry.

2658
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:08,600
The revolution is over.

2659
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,820
Forget the age of 30, I hear monster girls are in demand.

2660
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:18,040
I mean, I'm a ghost, so I'm technically a monster girl.

2661
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,040
Right?

2662
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:23,060
I think I'm technically a monster girl.

2663
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:25,100
I mean, I'm in the Monster Girl Encyclopedia.

2664
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:25,980
So...

2665
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:30,820
I mean...

2666
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:36,440
You know, so...

2667
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,740
I hear ghosts are in demand.

2668
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:45,850
What was this?

2669
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:53,860
I really want to become an eagle.

2670
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:56,440
I want to become half eagle.

2671
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:02,540
You guys, anything from here on out, if I push this button, anything else, we're going to have to not push the button!

2672
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:05,580
Or else I'm going to get punished!

2673
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:13,650
You can't touch a ghost.

2674
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,470
10 monster GF?

2675
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:16,190
Okay, hold on.

2676
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:17,470
Hold on!

2677
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:18,670
0 out of 10!

2678
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:20,570
Give me at least one point!

2679
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:23,350
Because...

2680
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:24,710
I can still possess you.

2681
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:29,590
And also...

2682
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:32,290
I mean, no, you can't really touch me.

2683
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:34,270
But I mean, there's also ectoplasm.

2684
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:36,450
Don't think too hard about it, okay?

2685
01:54:39,190 --> 01:54:40,730
Take the punishment like a boss.

2686
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,770
Push the button, because eagles are free!

2687
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:51,430
Why did most people not push the button?

2688
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:54,830
What the...

2689
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:57,010
Most people did not push the button!

2690
01:54:58,750 --> 01:54:59,550
Why?

2691
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:01,530
What's the downside?

2692
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:05,590
What's the downside?

2693
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:05,750
What's the downside?

2694
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:14,980
You are conscious in your dreams but you only have nightmares.

2695
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:16,760
Where is the good side?

2696
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:21,040
Where is the good side of this one?

2697
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:24,620
Cowards.

2698
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:25,640
They were all cowards.

2699
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:27,840
There is no good...

2700
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,080
This one is actually so bad.

2701
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:32,100
Why would I want to be conscious in my dreams if they're just nightmares?

2702
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:34,160
Why would that be good?

2703
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:39,760
Maybe because then if I'm conscious I could be like, oh, this is just a nightmare.

2704
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,640
Or rather, this is just a dream.

2705
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:42,460
It's no big deal.

2706
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:45,580
I won't be so scared of it, I'm guessing.

2707
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:48,140
Is the thought process...

2708
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:48,240
No.

2709
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:49,520
Get this out of here.

2710
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:58,380
You will swap genders but you will still have the same personality and relative attractiveness as before.

2711
01:55:58,480 --> 01:55:59,820
So I'll be fucking ugly!

2712
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,280
I will not push the button!

2713
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:03,160
What?

2714
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,080
Anyway...

2715
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,920
This is only bad for me.

2716
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:20,140
If I still have the same personality and everything I'm just gonna be actually a terrible, ugly idol ojisan and all my idols will hate me.

2717
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,260
I can only be an ojisan because I'm a girl and so it's...

2718
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,300
Oh,

2719
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:31,860
come on!

2720
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:35,900
I can only be an ojisan but I'm still a girl.

2721
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:36,260
Let's see...

2722
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,440
Oh wait, uuh.

2723
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:39,320
Uh.

2724
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:39,860
What.

2725
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,620
Left is seven

2726
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:52,920
You can sleep with anyone you choose but every other person has to be someone you don't want to sleep with.

2727
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,300
I like sleeping by myself though...

2728
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,500
It's too hot in the bed.

2729
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:13,800
I will not be pushing the button.

2730
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,040
What's the good side of this?

2731
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:18,360
It's just disrupting my sleep schedule.

2732
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:23,800
Wow, most people didn't press the button.

2733
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:27,740
Next!

2734
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:28,820
6.

2735
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,400
Oh, not 56, 6.

2736
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,280
So far these are...

2737
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:35,060
not so bad.

2738
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:39,660
Half-Life 3 will be released for free for everyone.

2739
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:43,460
But you can never play it.

2740
01:57:55,190 --> 01:57:56,770
Take one for the team.

2741
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:05,950
Save the people, Mint.

2742
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,370
That's a freebie?

2743
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:10,290
No, no, no.

2744
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:11,310
There are no freebies.

2745
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:15,430
Remember that Henya wants Half-Life 3?

2746
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:29,810
Hero.

2747
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:36,300
I'll be your hero.

2748
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:46,040
Hold on.

2749
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:47,680
I need some dramatic music.

2750
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,040
What the hell?

2751
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:07,900
Why are all these playlists?

2752
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:09,940
Hold on.

2753
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:14,240
I don't know how dramatic this is, but I'm gonna play it.

2754
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:34,720
I've never played Half-Life.

2755
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:41,170
But...

2756
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:46,270
for everybody's sake.

2757
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:55,200
For everybody's sake.

2758
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:58,000
Who's been waiting for Half-Life 3.

2759
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:04,460
All those years that you've been waiting.

2760
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:05,720
Hoping.

2761
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:06,560
Praying.

2762
02:00:07,370 --> 02:00:07,680
Wishing.

2763
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:10,080
On a fallen star.

2764
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:12,460
Someday, please.

2765
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:12,800
Release.

2766
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,940
Release Half-Life 3.

2767
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:18,760
And I hope...

2768
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,080
I hope it's a great one.

2769
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,580
I hope...

2770
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:33,560
I hope it's the greatest disappointment of your life!

2771
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:40,020
I hope you waited 20 years, 84 years for shit!

2772
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:43,080
I hope it comes out and I never play it.

2773
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,420
I can never play it.

2774
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:46,900
And I hope it's terrible for all of you guys!

2775
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:48,500
And it will be the worst!

2776
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:49,140
Oh my god.

2777
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:50,760
And it's going to be awful!

2778
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:53,760
It's going to be so bad!

2779
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:56,260
You're going to be so disappointed!

2780
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,200
You're going to be so disappointed!

2781
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:58,220
Yeah!

2782
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:04,220
Uh...

2783
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:11,270
Um...

2784
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:14,730
Anyway.

2785
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:15,650
Where were we?

2786
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:17,350
Um...

2787
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:18,930
Where were we?

2788
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:20,670
Uh...

2789
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:21,310
Oh yeah.

2790
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:32,320
Most people didn't press it.

2791
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,320
I contributed to the green.

2792
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:46,110
To lighten up this moment, has Mint heard the Burger King rep commercial about Spongebob's square ass?

2793
02:01:46,350 --> 02:01:47,190
This is real.

2794
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:48,470
I've never heard that.

2795
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:49,210
Uh...

2796
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:07,260
Half Life 3 is going to be a live service game.

2797
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:09,480
Oh...

2798
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:13,260
Oh...

2799
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:13,840
Oh...

2800
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:13,920
Oh...

2801
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:15,860
Done...

2802
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:17,380
Done...

2803
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:18,980
Next.

2804
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:27,380
You can make anything taste like what you want it to.

2805
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,480
But you will be constantly hungry.

2806
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,060
Oh no no no.

2807
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:33,120
Constantly hungry?

2808
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:35,300
Then what's the point of even eating what I want?

2809
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:36,920
What's the point?

2810
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:37,620
What's the point?

2811
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,360
Half Life 3 but with Blue Archive characters?

2812
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:44,340
Okay then...

2813
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:46,360
Do you want the greatest game ever?

2814
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,460
Put Blue Archive characters in anything and I'll be happy.

2815
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,340
You should let Hanya decide your punishment.

2816
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:53,260
Okay.

2817
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:55,360
Um...

2818
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:55,780
I will not.

2819
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,680
And most people agree with me.

2820
02:02:58,900 --> 02:02:59,380
...

2821
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:07,820
What if you could stay alive forever but you cannot communicate with anyone but yourself?

2822
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:11,340
Um...

2823
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:11,620
I...

2824
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:12,100
Who?

2825
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:12,820
Okay.

2826
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,580
Alexa play break sound.

2827
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:21,680
Um...

2828
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,360
This is like...

2829
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:23,660
Wait.

2830
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,880
Do people actually want to stay alive forever?

2831
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,400
Chancellor!

2832
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:28,420
Thanks for the 10 gifts!

2833
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,580
Do people actually want to stay alive forever?

2834
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:34,180
Like is that actually something?

2835
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:38,040
Like if people ever just think about it for just a tiny moment.

2836
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:39,080
Like if people ever just think about it for just a tiny moment.

2837
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:43,740
Like just a tiny moment.

2838
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:44,920
Like just a tiny moment.

2839
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,000
And also.

2840
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:49,760
You cannot communicate with anyone but yourself.

2841
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,920
It would be so bad.

2842
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:55,600
We get boring fast.

2843
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:56,260
Right?

2844
02:03:57,540 --> 02:03:59,820
This is like a huge trade off.

2845
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:00,360
So no.

2846
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:03,040
Okay.

2847
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:03,360
Next.

2848
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:06,680
Three.

2849
02:04:08,980 --> 02:04:11,340
You get your own free private jet.

2850
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,320
And a lifetime supply of jet fuel.

2851
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:14,200
In-flight snacks.

2852
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:14,800
Drinks.

2853
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:15,400
In-flight movies.

2854
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:18,220
And a busty flight attendant.

2855
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:35,640
But the busty flight attendant.

2856
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:41,000
But the busty flight attendant.

2857
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:41,200
But the busty flight attendant.

2858
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:51,000
But the bust...

2859
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,600
A private jet will one day be used in a massive terrorist attack.

2860
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,960
You do not know which day that will be.

2861
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:57,080
Um.

2862
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,140
But then they'll die!

2863
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:02,920
You guys I can't because the busty flight attendants will then cease to exist.

2864
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:03,520
I think.

2865
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:06,540
I think they'll die on the plane.

2866
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:10,460
That would be so sad.

2867
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:14,940
That would be so sad for them.

2868
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:16,340
And the world.

2869
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:17,860
Being deprived.

2870
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:20,180
Less booba.

2871
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:22,840
Save them.

2872
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:23,480
By.

2873
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:24,380
By.

2874
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,220
But also.

2875
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:29,440
What if we do invent.

2876
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:31,240
Um.

2877
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:32,940
Oh wait.

2878
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:34,740
It says you get your own free private jet.

2879
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:36,500
And a lifetime supply of jet fuel.

2880
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:39,040
In-flight snacks.

2881
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:40,480
Drinks.

2882
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,220
What do you mean snacks?

2883
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,780
What are we talking about?

2884
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:45,780
Like those tiny bags of pretzels.

2885
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:47,340
That has two pretzels in them.

2886
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,520
I don't want snacks.

2887
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:50,540
I want a whole ass meal.

2888
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:52,180
Save the booba.

2889
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:53,940
Save the busty.

2890
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,220
This is literally.

2891
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:58,100
This is.

2892
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,980
Are you guys for save the animals.

2893
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:01,960
Or kill the animals.

2894
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:04,900
That's a GDQ question.

2895
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:07,340
Save the busty flight attendants.

2896
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,620
Or kill the busty.

2897
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:09,980
Hold on.

2898
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:10,920
Let's make a poll.

2899
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:11,900
Let's make a poll.

2900
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:16,460
Okay guys.

2901
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:18,800
Save or kill.

2902
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,860
Save the busty flight.

2903
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:23,000
Attendants.

2904
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,280
Kill the busty flight.

2905
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:28,480
Attendants.

2906
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:33,460
Start.

2907
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,660
Save the animals.

2908
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:46,220
Oh!

2909
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:46,440
Did it go?

2910
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:48,020
Oh there it is.

2911
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:48,540
Oh.

2912
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,720
Wow a lot of people for saving them.

2913
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,520
Oh I spelled attendance wrong.

2914
02:06:53,740 --> 02:06:54,180
That's okay.

2915
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,320
Save the booba!

2916
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:56,880
Save the booba!

2917
02:06:57,140 --> 02:07:01,300
Save the BFA.

2918
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:04,600
Save the BFA.

2919
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:05,700
Save the frames.

2920
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:08,020
Kill the animals.

2921
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:08,840
Save the frames.

2922
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:19,600
Most people are saying, save the bus, save flight attendants.

2923
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:22,540
Flying is miserable anyway.

2924
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:24,660
I don't mind flying so much, I'll be honest.

2925
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:27,920
Greetings from Germany.

2926
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:28,980
First time watcher.

2927
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:29,780
Long time chatter.

2928
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,100
Save the attendants.

2929
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,400
Thank you, implode!

2930
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,720
Plot twist.

2931
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:37,960
The attendants are the terrorists.

2932
02:07:44,310 --> 02:07:48,250
And what if my jet is actually Metal Gear?

2933
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:53,010
What are their demands?

2934
02:07:53,210 --> 02:07:54,450
Big boss's body?

2935
02:07:59,950 --> 02:08:03,710
Even with that free, planes will bankrupt you.

2936
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:04,390
That's true.

2937
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:07,750
No more business class feet.

2938
02:08:07,950 --> 02:08:08,310
True!

2939
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:13,190
Now it's getting interesting.

2940
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:24,430
Most people say, save the BFA.

2941
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:26,430
Goodbye, frames.

2942
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:27,910
I will not be.

2943
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:29,830
Wow, most people said no.

2944
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:34,630
Most people also believe in the BFA.

2945
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:38,230
Let's see, next.

2946
02:08:44,910 --> 02:08:48,710
Everything you say will come true, but you will get the opposite of what you say.

2947
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:51,850
This is just like a monkey paw thing, isn't it?

2948
02:08:52,230 --> 02:08:53,670
What is the good side of this?

2949
02:08:55,530 --> 02:08:56,770
Take the jet and sell it.

2950
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:57,470
Keep the BFA.

2951
02:08:59,630 --> 02:09:00,870
Then it's out of my hands.

2952
02:09:00,890 --> 02:09:01,950
I wash my hands of this.

2953
02:09:02,650 --> 02:09:04,550
What if one of the attendants is just awesome?

2954
02:09:04,550 --> 02:09:07,390
And a skirt and an open blouse?

2955
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:09,890
I don't think he is busty enough.

2956
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,580
Is he busty enough?

2957
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,180
I don't know.

2958
02:09:18,620 --> 02:09:19,820
Just say the opposite.

2959
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:27,560
So say, everything I say won't come true.

2960
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:28,840
Wait, hold on.

2961
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:30,360
Wait.

2962
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:32,600
Say...

2963
02:09:34,580 --> 02:09:35,700
Say, I...

2964
02:09:36,420 --> 02:09:38,020
Everything I say...

2965
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:39,660
Wait.

2966
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:44,360
How do you phrase this?

2967
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,940
Say all the negative.

2968
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:55,400
Oh, yeah.

2969
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:04,560
Gosh, I wish I won't have a busty flight attendant.

2970
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:15,140
I don't want one million dollars in my bank account.

2971
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:23,700
But then, what if you accidentally say something that...

2972
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:26,800
What if you accidentally...

2973
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,280
What if you accidentally mess it up?

2974
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:32,940
This one is a scam.

2975
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:35,980
I feel like it's too easy to slip up, you know?

2976
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:38,640
It's too easy to slip up, I think.

2977
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:42,280
Get rid of it after your best wishes.

2978
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:42,740
Right?

2979
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,420
I will not be pressing the button.

2980
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:46,920
Okay, guys.

2981
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,360
Wow, he only pressed it one over.

2982
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:53,780
This one is also...

2983
02:10:53,780 --> 02:10:54,640
Wait.

2984
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:58,900
You can become invisible, but it works only one minute every day.

2985
02:10:59,020 --> 02:10:59,840
What's the downside?

2986
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,660
What's the downside?

2987
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:05,840
That it's a minute?

2988
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:06,740
Who cares?

2989
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:07,640
It's a free minute.

2990
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,600
There's no downside.

2991
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:11,040
Hold on.

2992
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:11,640
You guys...

2993
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,140
Let's skip this one.

2994
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:14,860
Let's skip this one.

2995
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,000
It's just a net good.

2996
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:19,720
Can I press it but not count?

2997
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:23,400
Actually, can I just skip it?

2998
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:28,360
Yeah, there needs to be a downside for it.

2999
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:34,880
But you're a ghost anyway.

3000
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,080
Yeah, it doesn't really even pertain to me.

3001
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:39,940
I'm in your rooms all the time.

3002
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:40,700
Hahaha.

3003
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:42,820
Okay.

3004
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:43,160
Skip, skip.

3005
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:46,500
I'm the minority.

3006
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:48,160
Okay.

3007
02:12:04,030 --> 02:12:06,210
You get 3,000 pounds.

3008
02:12:07,890 --> 02:12:11,350
Or US$3,000 for Brits per day.

3009
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,630
But you cannot exchange it for your local currency.

3010
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:15,350
Hahaha.

3011
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:31,360
So I just move to...

3012
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,580
I just move there?

3013
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:34,580
Like...

3014
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:37,060
What's the downside?

3015
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:43,080
I just get 3,000... 3,000 pounds a day.

3016
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:46,800
Living in England.

3017
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:47,380
Oof.

3018
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:52,340
Just save up and move.

3019
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:53,460
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

3020
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:56,260
I have to move to the UK.

3021
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:58,380
But it's free money.

3022
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:03,540
You can't exchange it for your local currency.

3023
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:06,000
So like...

3024
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,140
What if I go on a trip?

3025
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:09,120
I can exchange it for that currency?

3026
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:12,000
So I could exchange it for like...

3027
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:19,160
I could exchange it to another currency.

3028
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:19,980
It's fine.

3029
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:29,120
I'd rather die than become British.

3030
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:32,460
This one is a great one to end on for our EU friends today.

3031
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:36,180
For those watching in the EU hours.

3032
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:38,740
This one maybe is...

3033
02:13:38,740 --> 02:13:39,280
Hahaha.

3034
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:41,920
Is a good one to end on.

3035
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,500
Local means wherever you are.

3036
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:46,960
So I'm just stuck in the UK.

3037
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:48,940
I suppose.

3038
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:51,180
Right?

3039
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,020
But also...

3040
02:13:59,020 --> 02:13:59,840
Also...

3041
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:00,580
Consider this.

3042
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,200
Consider this.

3043
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:04,160
If I buy something with a credit card...

3044
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:05,520
It doesn't matter.

3045
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,300
What the currency is.

3046
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:07,660
Right?

3047
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:08,760
It just uses it.

3048
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:10,380
So...

3049
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:10,920
I see.

3050
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:12,340
A SIMP.

3051
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:15,860
It doesn't say you can't exchange it for Yen and then buy everything on AmiYami.

3052
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:16,300
So...

3053
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,860
I don't know about exchanging things.

3054
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:18,200
Well...

3055
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:18,680
Oh.

3056
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:19,860
2 Yen is fine.

3057
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:20,120
Yeah.

3058
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:23,900
Right?

3059
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:24,720
So...

3060
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:25,660
Bitcoin?

3061
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:33,330
Oh no.

3062
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:34,250
Not the cryptocurrency.

3063
02:14:35,110 --> 02:14:35,590
Loophole.

3064
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:40,790
So yeah.

3065
02:14:40,890 --> 02:14:41,610
If I just...

3066
02:14:41,610 --> 02:14:42,490
If I just...

3067
02:14:42,490 --> 02:14:43,130
Put it...

3068
02:14:43,130 --> 02:14:43,550
If I just...

3069
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:46,110
Have it in my bank account and use my credit card...

3070
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:46,730
It should be fine.

3071
02:14:47,990 --> 02:14:48,950
There's no negative.

3072
02:14:49,730 --> 02:14:51,050
Push that button!

3073
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:58,040
Well guys...

3074
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:58,680
Oh wait.

3075
02:14:58,740 --> 02:14:59,320
I think I...

3076
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:00,600
There we go.

3077
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:00,860
Zero.

3078
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:04,500
Well guys...

3079
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:05,960
I pushed it...

3080
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:07,600
I went over the limit.

3081
02:15:10,240 --> 02:15:11,440
I went over the limit.

3082
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:17,080
I will have a punishment.

3083
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:20,000
I will accept my punishment...

3084
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:21,640
Somehow.

3085
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,080
We'll figure something out.

3086
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:27,360
I missed one earlier.

3087
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,200
Wait, I did.

3088
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,740
Wait, the left or the...

3089
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:34,100
Two punishments.

3090
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:34,980
No!

3091
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,160
The limit does not exist.

3092
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:39,860
What have you been watching?

3093
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:41,380
Mean Girls lately?

3094
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:42,420
I don't know.

3095
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,460
I don't know.

3096
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:44,540
Oh no.

3097
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:48,980
Ah...

3098
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:56,780
Your punishment is to speedrun MGS1 but you must skip all cutscenes.

3099
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:58,040
That's just torture.

3100
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:00,520
Matara gives one.

3101
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,320
Hennia gives one.

3102
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:06,180
Okay I will ask Hennia and I will ask Matara for a punishment.

3103
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:08,660
From each of them.

3104
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:10,260
And I will do a punishment.

3105
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:12,060
From the...

3106
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:12,580
Each of them.

3107
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:13,740
So once...

3108
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:16,260
Once I know the punishment... Here, I'll even message them right now.

3109
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:17,280
I think Matara is streaming.

3110
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,500
Oh my god!

3111
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:25,560
This is so cute.

3112
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:27,880
Maya, oh my gosh, if you're still here, I just saw your message.

3113
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:28,800
It just opened up.

3114
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:33,000
Okay, Matara.

3115
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:42,900
Whenever you're free, I lost a challenge on my stream today.

3116
02:16:43,740 --> 02:16:45,800
Can you give me a Batsu?

3117
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:48,280
To do?

3118
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:51,160
Sad face.

3119
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:55,940
And Henya.

3120
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:57,240
Where is Henya?

3121
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:00,420
Henya!

3122
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:09,320
I was playing a game on stream and I lost.

3123
02:17:09,620 --> 02:17:11,380
So I have to do a punishment.

3124
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:15,660
Crying, crying, crying, crying, crying.

3125
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,640
Crying, crying, crying, crying, crying.

3126
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:25,040
My chat wants you to choose a punishment for me.

3127
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:33,680
Okay.

3128
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:40,770
Whenever I receive these, I will do them, I suppose.

3129
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:43,990
Can you give me a...

3130
02:17:53,370 --> 02:17:54,750
Okay, okay, okay.

3131
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:56,690
And it was for Half Life 3.

3132
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:31,320
Hold on, sorry.

3133
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:32,000
I'm responding to something.

3134
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,680
I sent that exact emoji.

3135
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:47,920
I sent that exact emoji to Henya.

3136
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:49,020
Of me crying.

3137
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:52,220
The same one.

3138
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:53,940
Both of them.

3139
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:57,100
And also the PN.

3140
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,520
PN, PN, PN.

3141
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:04,720
PN, PN, PN, PN, PN, PN.

3142
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:08,740
Okey-dokey, guys.

3143
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:09,800
Wow.

3144
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:11,680
We had some tough ones.

3145
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:12,800
Some of them were really easy.

3146
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:13,980
But some of them were pretty tough.

3147
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:16,260
I'm glad that we are all in agreement.

3148
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:18,040
That we would become eagle people.

3149
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:22,100
Eagle people, rise!

3150
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:25,740
Eagle people, rise!

3151
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:47,080
Anyway.

3152
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:49,260
Thank you guys for the stream today.

3153
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:53,480
This was very interesting.

3154
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:54,860
Some of these prompts were crazy.

3155
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:56,180
Thank you.

3156
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:56,500
Thank you.

3157
02:19:56,820 --> 02:19:57,260
Kiss.

3158
02:19:57,660 --> 02:19:58,100
Kiss.

3159
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,340
Thanks for all the button pushing.

3160
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:02,340
Just curious if you saw the trailer for Beetlejuice 2.

3161
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:03,400
I did!

3162
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:05,660
Not sure if he's a ghost role model for you or not.

3163
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:06,260
Oh my gosh!

3164
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:07,420
I did see the trailer!

3165
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:08,920
I saw it last night.

3166
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:10,620
Oh my gosh!

3167
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:14,580
And how Winrider's back.

3168
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:17,180
And they like...

3169
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:19,140
It's all still so campy looking.

3170
02:20:19,320 --> 02:20:20,420
It looks so good.

3171
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:21,860
I'm excited.

3172
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:22,780
It looks kind of fun.

3173
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:24,000
I'll probably watch it.

3174
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:26,740
But you have to play football.

3175
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:27,140
No!

3176
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:29,120
But I'm an eagle.

3177
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:30,040
I'm good at football.

3178
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:30,640
It doesn't matter.

3179
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,100
I can probably take them all down in one person.

3180
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,040
One eagle.

3181
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:35,240
Half person.

3182
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:36,700
I can take them down.

3183
02:20:36,820 --> 02:20:38,060
Half person, half eagle.

3184
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,420
Melanie, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3185
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,600
No, I just got here, PN.

3186
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:48,100
Sorry!

3187
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,560
Sorry, sorry.

3188
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:53,340
I'm cautiously optimistic about the movie.

3189
02:20:54,260 --> 02:20:55,800
Looks like they're still using stop motion.

3190
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:56,220
Yeah!

3191
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:57,900
I know.

3192
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:58,640
It's really cool.

3193
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:01,820
So...

3194
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:05,220
I've never seen Beetlejuice, but the broadcast is so good.

3195
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:06,400
Oh!

3196
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:09,780
I've seen some clips from the Broadway show.

3197
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:10,660
It looks funny.

3198
02:21:10,780 --> 02:21:11,340
It looks interesting.

3199
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:12,900
So...

3200
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:14,180
Why not?

3201
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,980
If you guys say my name three times, I might appear.

3202
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:18,220
But sometimes...

3203
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:19,500
Uhh...

3204
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,000
Sometimes...

3205
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,440
It only feels like if I wanna appear.

3206
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:22,500
Sometimes I don't wanna appear.

3207
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:23,620
You know?

3208
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:24,640
So...

3209
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:25,980
It's like when you call to a cat.

3210
02:21:26,140 --> 02:21:26,640
You're just like...

3211
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:27,380
Come here, cat!

3212
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:29,360
Sometimes they come, sometimes they don't.

3213
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:30,480
It's the same with me.

3214
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:31,000
You can try.

3215
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:34,220
Try saying Mint Phantom, Mint Phantom, Mint Phantom and I might appear.

3216
02:21:34,220 --> 02:21:35,880
I don't know.

3217
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:40,020
Depends on how I feel, you know?

3218
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:41,740
So, you can go ahead and try it.

3219
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:42,040
I don't know.

3220
02:21:57,250 --> 02:21:58,510
Matara sent me one too.

3221
02:21:59,210 --> 02:22:00,070
Oh my god.

3222
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,430
No!

3223
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:08,540
Hena sent me one.

3224
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:12,140
Hena sent me one.

3225
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:14,960
She sent me the game of Sisyphus.

3226
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:19,620
She wants me to play as a Sisyphus.

3227
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:30,970
And Matara sent me one.

3228
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:32,350
She said kiss me on the mouth.

3229
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,010
No.

3230
02:22:33,230 --> 02:22:34,030
Something else.

3231
02:22:52,360 --> 02:22:53,940
It's not that bad though, is it?

3232
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:55,340
It can't be that bad.

3233
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,420
I saw Fauna cleared it, right?

3234
02:22:59,420 --> 02:22:59,860
Randall!

3235
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,360
Thanks for the five gifted!

3236
02:23:01,460 --> 02:23:02,140
Thank you so much!

3237
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:09,940
Can't be that bad, right?

3238
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:31,140
Fauna just ran up the hill.

3239
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:37,020
She cleared it without touching the boulder.

3240
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:42,160
Oh my god.

3241
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:42,840
God Gamer.

3242
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:46,220
God Gamer.

3243
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:56,240
Well, then I... then I'll... do... I'll... I'll... play it, I guess.

3244
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:58,600
Wait, hold on.

3245
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,420
Uh-oh, my YouTube is frozen.

3246
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:02,420
I'm just gonna look at chat from here.

3247
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:11,600
I meant about that pole.

3248
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:12,900
Don't worry about it.

3249
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:17,220
Don't even... don't even worry about it.

3250
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:22,620
If you say phantom three times fast, you get a big phantom appreciate power time.

3251
02:24:24,380 --> 02:24:25,400
Wait, what?

3252
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:30,380
Oh no, wait, this doesn't work either.

3253
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:35,040
I can't... I can't see or... I can't... I can't scroll up, so I can't read it.

3254
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:35,380
Hold on.

3255
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,120
One second.

3256
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:42,920
There we go.

3257
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:48,800
You get big phantom appreciate power time when you're in the gym.

3258
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:56,220
Phantom game... gains.

3259
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:59,840
Get the phantom gains, everybody.

3260
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:03,580
You get fap time.

3261
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:06,320
No!

3262
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:09,680
Thank you guys for watching my stream!

3263
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:16,930
Thank you!

3264
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:18,610
I will see you guys tomorrow.

3265
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:20,550
I will be not streaming.

3266
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:25,490
I will be at Anime North in the parking lot, baby!

3267
02:25:28,570 --> 02:25:31,610
But thank you guys for helping me make these super-duper difficult decisions.

3268
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:35,870
I guess I will play as a Sisyphus before... before...

3269
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:37,370
Before...

3270
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:41,050
Oh, Matarai says...

3271
02:25:46,990 --> 02:25:48,510
Matarai is still coming up with the punishment.

3272
02:25:51,130 --> 02:25:53,330
And I will play as a Sisyphus sometime.

3273
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:55,150
Thank you guys!

3274
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,470
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3275
02:25:56,730 --> 02:25:58,690
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

3276
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:02,510
And I will see you... later...

3277
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:03,650
Bye men.

3278
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:04,650
Bye Bechtel Bill!

3279
02:26:04,870 --> 02:26:05,630
Thank you for a month!

3280
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:06,550
Bye bye!

3281
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:10,130
Have a good day!

3282
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:10,710
Have a good day!

3283
02:26:11,130 --> 02:26:11,770
Bye bye!

3284
02:26:12,110 --> 02:26:12,710
Bye bye!

3285
02:26:12,730 --> 02:26:12,970
Bye bye!

3286
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:13,250
Bye bye!

3287
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:13,610
Thank you!

3288
02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:13,950
Thank you!

3289
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:14,190
Thank you!

3290
02:26:17,050 --> 02:26:17,450
Woo!

3291
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:31,640
Mario Kart Wii!

3292
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:34,420
Woohoo!

3293
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:36,280
Mario Kart Wii!

3294
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:42,530
Actually, hold on.

3295
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:44,650
That's going to be the ending music today.

3296
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:46,910
That's going to be the ending music today.

3297
02:26:53,930 --> 02:26:55,070
You got the golden star!

3298
02:27:03,350 --> 02:27:04,890
Get coconut mauled!

3299
02:27:19,630 --> 02:27:21,610
I don't remember the middle of the song!

3300
02:27:30,530 --> 02:27:34,970
You just got coconut mauled!
