1
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,220
And

2
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,920
then I said, whoa!

3
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,680
And then she said, whoa!

4
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,920
Isn't that so funny?

5
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,720
Oh my god.

6
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,840
You're like so funny.

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,980
Oh my god.

You're like so funny.

9
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Oh my god, it's like I can tell you everything.

10
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,900
It's like I can tell you all my thoughts and my feelings and just...

11
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,880
Can you be my therapist?

12
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,920
Nah, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do my job.

13
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
I just wanna sit here.

14
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,300

15
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360

Hold on, you guys.

18
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,300
Hold on.

19
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Um... Oh, I wish I had like... The sound of like a... Like, you know... Oh gosh, what's it called?

20
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,100
Uh... The... When you move something really old and it kinda like... It sounds like a boulder.

21
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,020
It's like...

22
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,800
That's what I was gonna... Hold on.

23
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,880
I'll just do it in my voice.

24
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,270
Not creaky.

25
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,570
It's like... How do you say...

26
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,050
Uh... I can't... I... It's... It's like a...

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,150
It's like a boulder.

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,470
Like moving a tomb.

29
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Hold on.

32
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,630
Why am I like so far forward?

33
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,930
I'm like leaning so forward.

34
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,110
Okay, let me get up.

35
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,050
I push my chair away.

36
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,270
I'll move.

37
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,610
I'm so small.

38
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,570
I'm so small.

39
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,040
Wait, let me move my mic too.

40
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,640
Um...

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,150
Sorry.

42
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,390
I have to like lean in cause my mic is...

43
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,770
Is low.

44
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,690
It's here.

45
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,010
It's here.

46
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,950
My arms kinda cross.

47
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,170
Do your job.

48
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,230
Body.

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,190
Hello, everybody.

55
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,530

59
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,570
You should be saying...

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,430
So if I say...

61
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,910

You see my hand?

71
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,530
I'm giving an okay symbol.

72
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,350
Ok.

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,770
I haven't said it yet.

76
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,450
I haven't said it.

77
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,910
I haven't said it yet.

78
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:00,770
Ok.

79
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,130
Ready?

80
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,450
Oh wait.

82
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,870
Let's do a role play.

83
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,390
Hold on.

84
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,070
Wait.

Is it...

88
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,430
Is it following me?

89
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,470
I thought I turned that off.

90
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:16,870
Hold on.

91
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,030
Let me change some settings.

92
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,310
I had to...

93
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,390
I had to change things and then I forgot to save the settings.

94
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,470
Wait.

95
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
Did I change it?

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,240
Can't remember.

97
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,120

Please.

104
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,400
Hold on a moment.

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,960
Please.

106
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,380
Please help.

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,720
Where is it?

108
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,240
I should...

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,460
I thought I turned it off.

110
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,040
Please.

111
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,820
Hold.

112
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,720
Please help.

113
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,370
Gosh.

114
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,930
Maybe...

115
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,590
What if I do this?

116
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,450
I'm frozen!

117
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,410
Oh!

118
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:12,490
No!

119
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,730
Ok, we are fine?

120
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,960
No...

121
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,480
I don't know what I'm doing!

122
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:40,120

Okay, I give up.

126
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,640
I give up, I give up.

127
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,060
Let me get rid of my desk.

128
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,140
Now I'm like really floating, hold on.

129
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll make myself a little bit bigger.

130
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:27,220
I don't like the... I don't like the... the coloring that Waterdough does, but...

131
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,780
It is what it is.

132
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,900
Ta-da!

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,940
Hang on, let me adjust my mic again.

134
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,000
Oops, sorry, my arms go crazy.

135
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,080
My arms go crazy!

136
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,400
Anyway, I'm back you guys!

137
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,100
Hello!

138
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,080
Hello!

139
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,860
I got Mokopi, and I like put it together just today.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
Cause I was like...

141
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,080
What if I just...

142
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,780
What if I...

143
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,480
What if...

144
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,620
What if I use it?

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,840
Cause I got it, and it came...

146
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,800
And I have all of my technology working at once.

147
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,500
I can't really clap though.

148
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,120
It's not perfect.

149
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,800
It's definitely...

150
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,420
A very...

151
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,560
Home...

152
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,900
3D...

153
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,500
Setup.

154
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,560
That's for sure.

155
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,740
But...

156
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:27,840
Yeah.

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
All my technology.

158
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,360
All my technology!

159
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,060
Yeah!

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,580
Wait...

161
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:33,960
Yeah!

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,140
First!

163
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,280
Yeah!

164
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh, yeah!

165
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,520
Um...

166
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,300
Thank you guys for all the welcome backs.

167
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

168
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,960
Um...

169
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,580
Uh...

170
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,600
Sorry for any awkward clipping.

171
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,640
Like, my sh...

172
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
My arms...

173
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,940
It's just gonna have...

174
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,100
That's just how it'll be.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,920
But, when I have my actual 3D debut...

176
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,920
It'll be...

177
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,000
Much...

178
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:00,980
Nicer.

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,920
Don't worry about it.

180
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,480
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,460
It's just 3D things.

182
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,320
Happy...

184
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,960
Birthday...

185
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:13,980
PH423R!

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,060
Happy Birthday!

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,260
I wish that I could say that my voice was better...

188
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,340
After...

189
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,260
Being gone, but...

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,560
Um...

191
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,960
Sorry, guys.

192
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,040
It's not...

193
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
It's not any better.

194
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,920
I thought that maybe having the break would...

195
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,040
Make it a little bit better, but...

196
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,060
It really didn't.

197
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,140
So, I'm sorry.

198
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,080
I still can't sing a song...

199
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,500
For you.

200
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,000
So sorry.

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,720
You worked a lot, didn't you?

202
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,320
I did!

203
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,280
Some things...

204
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,420
I can talk about.

205
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,260
Some things...

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,280
I cannot talk about.

207
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,400
NG, NG, NG.

208
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,480
But...

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,740
I can talk about some things.

210
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,640
Let me...

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,100
Scoot a little bit more...

212
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,260
Since I'm...

213
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,700
Falling...

214
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:07,820
Oh!

215
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,220
Nope.

216
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,180
That's not what I wanna do.

217
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,220
That's...

218
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,900
Oh!

219
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,600
That's better.

220
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:16,940
Um...

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,060
What else was I gonna say?

222
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,500
Yeah.

223
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,440
So...

224
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,060
I will...

225
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,100
Talk about things.

226
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,820
And I also wanna watch the state of play.

227
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,380
And...

228
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,100
Um...

229
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,890
Thank you!

230
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,150
Thank you!

231
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,270
Thank you, thank you, thank you for all the super tattoo guys!

232
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,910
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

233
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,810
She's so tall.

234
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,050
Yeah, I am!

235
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,350
Um...

236
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,130
I can touch the ceiling!

237
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,350
Oh!

238
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,790
Oh!

239
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,110
Nothing spilled.

240
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,810
We're okay.

241
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,260
We're okay.

242
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,940
Carefully put that somewhere else.

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,920
Carefully...

244
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
Put that...

245
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
In another location?

246
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,720
No...

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,880
Um...

248
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,480
I'll probably sit later.

249
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,400
If that's okay.

250
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,620
Uh...

251
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,640
Well, I'll set for sure for the state of play.

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,580
Um...

253
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,060
But first I wanna tell you about my stories.

254
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,340
Where I've been up to.

255
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm sure you guys seen some stuff on Twitter and were just like...

256
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,860
Ooh...

257
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
What's happening?

258
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,620
What's happening?

259
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,280
Where?

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,360
I wish I could stop the camera.

261
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,240
Sorry, it's still bothering me.

262
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,100
Hold on, let me look one more time.

263
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,260
Uh...

264
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,600
Uh...

265
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,880
Uh...

266
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,760
Uh...

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,340
Uh...

268
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,620
Uh...

269
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,180
Uh...

270
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,640
Uh...

271
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,680
I don't know...

272
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,980
I'm so like...

273
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,280
I'm...

274
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,420
Oh!

275
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,400
Wait, what is that?

276
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,280
Go away.

277
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,000
3D arrows.

278
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,200
They appear.

279
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Here boy, happy birthday!

280
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,240
Happy birthday!

281
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Sorry I missed it right before my trip.

282
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,480
It feels like forever since I've...

283
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,020
I feel...

284
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,360
I feel like...

285
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,840
Even more awkward than usual.

286
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,480
Because first of all, I'm in...

287
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,080
I'm in...

288
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,560
Oh...

289
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,720
I'm clipping through my body.

290
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,620
It's just ghost things, you know?

291
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,940
First of all, I'm in 3D.

292
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,500
And then second of all, it's because I...

293
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,800
Uh...

294
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,160
What's the word?

295
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,000
What's the word?

296
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,600
Oh!

297
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,740
I feel...

298
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,560
Because it's been so long since I've...

299
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,700
Streamed.

300
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,540
So it feels like...

301
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,400
Forever, forever.

302
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,500
Fuzzy happy birthday!

303
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,200
Happy, happy birthday!

304
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,040
Happy birthday.

305
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,180
And it's a little awkward.

306
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,660
Because I'm having to...

307
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,220
Watch out for everything.

308
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,760
Especially you.

309
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,280
You guys.

310
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,920
Having to watch out for you guys.

311
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,980
We missed you?

312
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,480
Really?

313
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,760
Did you?

314
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,760
Did you miss me?

315
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,540
Even a little bit?

316
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,920
Did you?

317
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:05,840
Hmm?

318
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
Did you miss me?

319
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,080
Oh!

320
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,860
Oh my gosh!

321
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,440
Thank you!

322
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,900
Thank you for the...

323
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,780
Thank you!

324
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,120
Thank you!

325
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,360
Thank you!

326
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,640
Thank you!

327
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,480
Thank you!

328
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,340
Maybe a little bit?

329
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,360
What's it like seeing me in home 3D?

330
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,880
How's it feel?

331
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,460
Stick'em up!

332
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,740
Oh!

333
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,780
That doesn't really work.

334
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,880
This is actually my new 3D tool.

335
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,180
So...

336
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,380
But the lighting is a little...

337
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,620
I don't know how...

338
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,800
I couldn't fix it in time.

339
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,840
Not what I was having trouble with before stream.

341
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,680
Some other stuff.

342
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,440
But...

343
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,040
Yes.

344
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,480
So...

345
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
I went to Japan again.

346
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,500
And I...

347
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,440
Oh my gosh.

348
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,500
So many birthdays.

349
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,200
I think I'm just gonna have to do like a general...

350
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,240
Happy birthday.

351
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,140
Everybody that I miss.

352
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,980
Will...?

353
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,840
Happy birthdayaaa!

354
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,140
We- We- We- We- We- We We- We debts- Weину!

355
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,020
We-

356
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,900
That many birthdays probably.

357
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,500
My left hand seems to be mostly fine, or... Yeah, my left hand seems to be mostly fine.

358
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,980
My right hand is having some issues.

359
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,220
Such is the way of 3D.

360
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Thank you.

361
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,580
Thank you for the very cute...

362
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,400
Very cute as a thumbnail.

363
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,760
Thank you, thank you.

364
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
Kung Fu action?

365
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,960
Why do I trip?

366
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,240
Why do I do that?

367
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,380
You're that ninja.

368
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,040
But yeah, so I went...

369
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,400
And I can tell some stories.

370
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,980
Why do I feel so awkward?

371
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,060
I don't know.

372
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,040
I feel so awkward.

373
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,260
I don't know.

374
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,240
Maybe I feel so exposed, you know?

375
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,920
Like, I feel like I have to just keep moving.

376
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,460
And grooving.

377
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,040
And schmoving.

378
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,680
Um...

379
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,620
I went...

380
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:58,980
For...

381
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,200
Two...

382
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,880
Almost two...

383
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,140
Plus one finger.

384
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:07,960
Come on.

385
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,640
Cambare.

386
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,760
Cambare.

387
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,700
Two.

388
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,400
Two.

389
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,260
Two.

390
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,460
Two.

391
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,240
No, that's three.

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,880
Pick number two, my lord.

393
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
About two weeks, yes.

394
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,380
Pick...

395
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,940
Pick number three, my lord.

396
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,640
Can I do it?

397
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,660
Can I do it?

398
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,340
It's really struggling.

399
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,500
Maybe with this hand.

400
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,980
Nope.

401
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,920
I give up.

402
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,600
I give up.

403
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,440
Um...

404
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,620
And...

405
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,640
Oh my gosh!

406
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,460
You guys...

407
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,540
I have to talk about...

408
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
What's his name?

409
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,880
No, I wrote it down.

410
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,870
I watched a movie on the plane.

411
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,970
I have to talk about...

412
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,250
John Wick!

413
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,850
Oh!

414
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,350
Oh my god!

415
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,290
It was so good!

416
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,990
Oh my gosh!

417
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,170
John!

418
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,930
No, not Alan Wake.

419
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,090
Not that...

420
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,710
That's the...

421
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,370
That's a game.

422
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,270
That's a video game.

423
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,810
I watched John Wick.

424
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,950
And at first...

425
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,410
I feel like I've always said that it's really good.

426
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,650
But I was like...

427
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,050
I'm scared.

428
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,310
And I...

429
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,290
Luckily, I knew that the dog...

430
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,710
Was gonna happen.

431
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,950
But I...

432
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,070
So, I was prepared.

433
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,250
I was prepared for that.

434
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:35,850
Hold on.

435
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,010
Hold on a second.

436
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,960
But...

437
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,700
Why is my hand so messed up?

438
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,280
Stop it!

439
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,020
But, uh...

440
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,400
Um...

441
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,100
The movie itself was actually so good.

442
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,920
They only had the first one...

443
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,080
And the fourth one.

444
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,780
So...

445
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,680
I could only...

446
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,140
I only watched the first one...

447
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,800
Cause...

448
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm not gonna skip...

449
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,060
Three movies.

450
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,820
That would be ridiculousness.

451
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,000
The first one is the best IMO.

452
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,560
Is it?

453
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,640
Okay.

454
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,720
Wait.

455
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,940
So it doesn't get better from you?

456
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,080
It's not gonna get any better.

457
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,800
It's a classic.

458
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,980
It was so good.

459
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
It was so, so good.

460
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,220
Four is peak?

461
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,120
Four is better.

462
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,520
Should we do a watch-a-lock?

463
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,460
Of all of them?

464
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,180
Should we?

465
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:30,960
Should we?

466
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,020
I wanna watch the first one again.

467
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,180
I was like...

468
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,220
I need to talk to everybody about this movie.

469
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,260
I need to talk to people about John Wick.

470
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,600
Not Alan Wake.

471
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,260
Is Keanu Reeves in that game too?

472
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,820
Why do I keep thinking?

473
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,920
Why do I keep thinking that?

474
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,040
No?

475
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,720
Yes?

476
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,140
No.

477
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,980
He's not.

478
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,520
No, he's in Cyberpunk.

479
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:04,970
Uh-oh.

480
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,230
Wait.

481
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:05,550
Hold on.

482
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,410
I just noticed something.

483
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,270
Hold on.

484
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:07,990
Be every...

485
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,230
I'll still be here, I mean.

486
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,410
But I need to fix something.

487
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,830
I just noticed something.

488
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,650
Uh-b-b-b-b.

489
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,170
Don't mind me.

490
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,070
Wait, how do I fix this?

491
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,790
How do I fix this?

492
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,230
Wait, here.

493
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,450
She's gone.

494
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,510
I ghosted you.

495
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,950
Actually, I'm going to sit down.

496
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,050
Is that okay now, you guys?

497
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,230
Um, where is it?

498
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,910
Where is it?

499
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,690
Yes, thank you for your permission.

500
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,930
Hold on, I'm still trying to fix this.

501
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,990
I just have to figure out where it is.

502
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,510
Oh, there it is.

503
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,100
Ha ha.

504
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,140
Ha ha.

505
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,220
Okay, I fixed something.

506
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,350
I'm going to become bigger now.

507
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,140
I don't know why my right arm is acting so buggy.

508
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,080
You're just going to have to get over it, I think.

509
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,020
Let me put my desk.

510
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,360
Three, two, one.

511
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,830
How do I fit?

512
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,570
I want to be just a little big.

513
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,670
Closer.

514
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,650
Like this.

515
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,990
Ah.

516
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,710
You can see my tooth.

517
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,840
You can see my tooth.

518
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,480
Ah.

519
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,740
Maybe this is fine.

520
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,840
Nah, here is fine.

521
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,850
This is probably better.

522
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,250
Big man's a jump scout.

523
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,590
Wait.

524
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,610
Wait.

525
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,110
Why is my arm so messed up?

526
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,780
Jump scout.

527
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,790
Jump scout.

528
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,210
Wait, wait, wait.

529
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,260
Nice paint and nails.

530
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,960
Thank you.

531
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,800
Wait.

532
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,180
Like, my keeps getting in the way.

533
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,020
Wait.

534
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,000
Why is it now tracking?

535
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,000
Sorry, I'm no, I'm no doobie.

536
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,280
I'm no, I'm no doobie.

537
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,960
Give me bro fist.

538
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:12,900
Wait.

539
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,640
Fit.

540
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,420
Nope.

541
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,600
Uh.

542
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,020
Go-go.

543
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,060
Go-go gadget.

544
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,080
Fist.

545
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
It doesn't work.

546
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,640
Go-go.

547
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:22,860
Ah.

548
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,200
Ah.

549
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
There you go.

550
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,440
Yeah.

551
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,040
Bumpy.

552
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,580
Yeah, I'll get rid of my desk so that you can see more, I suppose.

553
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,660
It's kind of embarrassing, though, when it doesn't work, so.

554
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,640
Don't be so judgmental, okay?

555
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,360
Bumpy.

556
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,440
Bumpy, bro.

557
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,760
Yeah.

558
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,100
Yeah.

559
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,240
Yeah.

560
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah.

561
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,160
Yeah.

562
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,060
Okay.

563
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
Um.

564
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,320
So, yeah.

565
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,480
We'll do a watch along then of...

566
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,560
The John Wick.

567
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,200
The John Wick.

568
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,760
But those were my trip.

569
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,520
It was mostly cold.

570
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:24,960
Cold!

571
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,220
And rainy.

572
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,360
So much rain.

573
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,960
But cold.

574
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,500
That was what I wasn't expecting.

575
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,000
Like, um.

576
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,480
It's kind of an unusual, no?

577
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,220
For, like, the end of May?

578
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,500
I think?

579
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,160
You need John Cat.

580
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,920
Who's that?

581
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,660
I can see cavities.

582
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,600
No, you can't!

583
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,840
I brush my teeth every day.

584
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,520
I brush my teeth every day.

585
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,440
Oh, it's almost summer.

586
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:50,980
I know!

587
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,900
And it was so chilly.

588
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,300
I had...

589
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,320
I packed...

590
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,340
I packed just a few sweaters.

591
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,600
Because, uh...

592
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Oh, that's Bebo's cat.

593
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,100
Wait!

594
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm not there yet!

595
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,120
I'm not there yet, you guys.

596
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,380
You're...

597
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,240
You're jumping ahead.

598
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,080
You're jumping ahead.

599
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,960
Of my stories, okay?

600
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,500
You're jumping ahead.

601
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,260
But, um...

602
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,820
Yeah.

603
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,300
Oh!

604
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,980
So, I get there.

605
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,380
And then, uh...

606
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,200
Day...

607
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,120
After?

608
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,540
No.

609
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,360
The day after after.

610
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,620
So, I get there.

611
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,460
Man.

612
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,480
Two days later.

613
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,640
I...

614
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
Have a practice with Koyo.

615
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,920
Um...

616
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,420
Koyori.

617
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,980
Uh...

618
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,740
Kamono friends.

619
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,660
V...

620
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,420
V Kemono.

621
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,580
Kem...

622
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,300
Kemo...

623
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,400
V...

624
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,900
Uh...

625
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
V...

626
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,820
V...

627
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
V...

628
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,220
V...

629
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,820
Kemo V...

630
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,500
Kemo V...

631
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,240
Kemo V...

632
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,400
That...

633
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,160
That...

634
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,620
Um...

635
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,140
I met with her to practice.

636
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,320
If you didn't see...

637
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,520
Hold on.

638
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,340
Let me post.

639
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,920
D-d-d-d...

640
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:09,980
Koyo...

641
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,000
Graduation...

642
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,300
Uh...

643
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,580
What?

644
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,120
How do you say?

645
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,920
It wasn't...

646
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,440
It wasn't her actual, like, last stream.

647
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,460
It's like a...

648
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,340
How did she title it?

649
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,580
How did she...

650
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,040
Farewell party...

651
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,600
3-d...

652
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,760
3-d...

653
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,420
3-d party...

654
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,620
There you go.

655
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,200
You should go watch.

656
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,640
It was really fun.

657
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,700
Um...

658
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
She and I...

659
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,600
Uh...

660
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,400
Practiced...

661
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,720
We practiced our dance.

662
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,380
But she kept shocking me.

663
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,360
Every time.

664
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,820
Every time we touched.

665
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,820
She shocked me.

666
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,160
Every time.

667
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,160
Every time.

668
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,020
Literally.

669
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,220
Uh...

670
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,680
It got to the point where...

671
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,720
She...

672
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
Would get close to me.

673
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,560
And we had this...

674
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,440
Electric...

675
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,620
Electric...

676
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,260
Energy.

677
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,400
Yeah.

678
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,400
And...

679
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:07,940
Um...

680
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,040
Um...

681
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,640
Yeah.

682
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,600
She was, like, trying to use her phone to...

683
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,580
To...

684
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,660
What's the word?

685
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,000
To operate...

686
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,800
The music.

687
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,700
And she was, like...

688
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,680
Mintz, I need you to turn my phone on.

689
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,500
Because...

690
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,660
She kept shocking herself.

691
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,440
I think it's the...

692
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,420
I think it's, like...

693
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,740
Her fur...

694
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,080
On her...

695
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,140
On her...

696
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,800
Fluffy, fluffy tail.

697
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,080
I think it was her fluffy, fluffy fur.

698
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,540
Mmm...

699
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,600
Fluffy tail.

700
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,360
That was so staticky, though.

701
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,340
Not the F-boy, though.

702
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,140
Uh...

703
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,240
Oh!

704
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,000
Where'd I go?

705
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,960
Did you guys see anything?

706
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,300
Wait...

707
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
What just happened?

708
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,880
I don't know what just happened.

709
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,260
I didn't touch anything.

710
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,140
I don't know.

711
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,340
I didn't touch anything.

712
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,760
I didn't touch anything.

713
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,260
Anyway...

714
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,620
Um...

715
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,720
Um...

716
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,540
But then...

717
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,180
Oh my gosh.

718
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,380
Originally, when we practiced...

719
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,340
Um...

720
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,280
Originally, when we practiced...

721
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,140
She...

722
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,160
Wanted to have a part where...

723
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,960
She jumped over my back.

724
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,340
Like...

725
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,280
Like a frog.

726
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,500
Like a hopscotch.

727
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,520
And, um...

728
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,640
We ended up having to scrap that.

729
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
Because we were like...

730
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:52,840
Maybe...

731
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,200
The Japari Park staff...

732
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,120
Will get mad at us.

733
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,920
So...

734
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,380
Leapfrog?

735
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,200
Yeah, what did I say?

736
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,620
What did I say?

737
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Huh?

738
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,100
Oh, I said hopscotch.

739
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,660
Oh.

740
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,940
Yeah.

741
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,280
Like a...

742
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,580
Leapfrog.

743
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,020
Yep.

744
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,800
We...

745
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
We cut that.

746
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,580
Because...

747
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,580
Uh...

748
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,800
We were scared that...

749
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,980
Park staff would get...

750
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,640
Upset at us.

751
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,900
So...

752
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,220
But we tried it.

753
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,500
And...

754
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,220
She like...

755
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,360
Was able to jump on my back.

756
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:37,960
Pretty good.

757
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:38,920
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,860
Hmm...

759
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,660
But then...

760
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:43,860
Uh...

761
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,500
Uh...

762
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,340
Uh...

763
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,860
For a more infamous...

764
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,820
Um...

765
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,660
Spot.

766
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,360
Uh...

767
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,020
She was like...

768
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,660
Mito...

769
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,860
Mito, do you know how to...

770
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,540
Uh...

771
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,180
Cartwheel?

772
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,880
And I was like...

773
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,420
Yes...

774
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,920
Hmm...

775
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,560
Yes...

776
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,600
I know how to cartwheel!

777
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:10,820
You!

778
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,260
And...

779
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
And...

780
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Um...

781
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,060
Um...

782
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,900
Um...

783
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,260
Um...

784
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,240
Yeah...

785
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,960
Uh...

786
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,120
Essentially...

787
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,580
I showed her my cartwheel...

788
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,420
And...

789
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,120
Wait, hold on.

790
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,640
Let me...

791
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,560
Restart something.

792
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,780
Hold on.

793
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,100
I'm gonna disappear again.

794
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,380
I'm gonna disappear again.

795
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,920
But, uh...

796
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,620
She said...

797
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,680
Show me your cartwheel!

798
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,980
And I did.

799
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,640
And she was like...

800
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:48,980
You know what?

801
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,060
It might be actually...

802
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,240
Better if...

803
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,620
You know...

804
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,280
I do a proper cartwheel...

805
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,780
And...

806
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Yours is bad.

807
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,500
And I was like...

808
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,380
What do you mean bad?

809
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,900
Hey!

810
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,600
Oh, hold on.

811
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,220
I gotta reset.

812
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh!

813
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,020
You hear that?

814
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,780
What do you do?

815
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,300
Did you hear that?

816
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,450
But, uh...

817
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,250
Why is...

818
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,590
Why am I looking up so high?

819
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,390
Hmm...

820
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,690
I might go to 2D...

821
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,530
If it keeps being annoying.

822
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,030
Sorry, guys.

823
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,730
I'll just...

824
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,450
I'll just adjust.

825
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,150
Um...

826
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,550
So, yeah.

827
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,890
That was a great cartwheel.

828
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,510
Coyle really showed everyone your stuff.

829
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,690
I told her.

830
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,290
I told her.

831
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,190
I was like...

832
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,470
I was like...

833
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,050
Everyone's gonna see...

834
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,650
Coyle.

835
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,610
Everybody's going to see my panties.

836
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,210
And...

837
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,350
That...

838
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,250
She said it was okay.

839
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,170
That was her.

840
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,070
She.

841
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:58,850
She.

842
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,490
She said...

843
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:00,710
Oh!

844
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,070
It's okay.

845
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:02,630
Maybe.

846
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,750
That one...

847
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,770
So, that one was on purpose.

848
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,870
We decided to go with that bit instead.

849
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,870
But...

850
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,350
Then I ended up seeing my panties everywhere.

851
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,290
And that wasn't intentional.

852
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,850
Just the one.

853
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,270
Just the...

854
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,450
Just the single one.

855
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,510
Alright.

856
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:24,310
There we go.

857
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,970
Just the single one.

858
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,810
What was that?

859
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,270
Oh!

860
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:28,990
Oh!

861
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,110
Kaz, what are you doing in here?

862
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:33,450
Oh.

863
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,100
What are you doing in here?

864
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,590
What happened?

865
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,110
Wait.

866
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,660
What happened?

867
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,240
I thought you wouldn't be able to see anything.

868
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,940
The camera followed you.

869
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,140
That's because I couldn't turn off the settings.

870
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,670
What did you see?

871
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,570
I saw London.

872
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,030
I saw France.

873
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:51,890
No!

874
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,970
How much?

875
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,070
How do I stop the camera from following me?

876
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,790
How do I stop it?

877
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,990
I tried.

878
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:05,830
I tried.

879
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,110
I thought I turned it off earlier.

880
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,470
Or rather...

881
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,030
I found it earlier.

882
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,490
Now I can't find it again.

883
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:13,550
Oh.

884
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,550
I thought because it was on my face, you wouldn't see anything.

885
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,470
Hot dog.

886
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,400
Pause knew what she was doing.

887
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,920
Ow!

888
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,680
I turned around.

889
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,080
I was petting her.

890
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,620
I was petting her.

891
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,920
Anyway.

892
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,600
Erase.

893
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,780
Erase from...

894
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,280
Erase from your mind.

895
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,400
Erase.

896
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,220
Erase.

897
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,160
Erase from your mind.

898
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,320
What's it gonna be?

899
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Wait.

900
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,320
What's it gonna be?

901
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,640
Beep, beep, beep.

902
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,460
What's it gonna be?

903
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,720
What's it gonna be?

904
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,580
What's it gonna be?

905
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,640
Erase, erase, erase, erase.

906
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,720
Anyway.

907
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,060
Anyway.

908
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:25,940
Yeah.

909
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,060
Well, wow.

910
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,360
I was just talking about accidental...

911
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
accidental flashing.

912
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,140
I was just talking about accidental flashing.

913
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,400
Here we go.

914
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm embarrassed.

915
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,740
I wasn't ready to show you.

916
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,420
Sorry if I'm a little low energy today.

917
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,320
Also, guys, I'm still jet lagged.

918
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,160
So...

919
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,220
So...

920
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,560
Yeah.

921
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,660
And...

922
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,240
Um...

923
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
My brain is all...

924
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,610
Because I can't...

925
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
I had to write down some stuff.

926
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,220
I couldn't remember anything.

927
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,820
Thank you for the demonstration.

928
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,300
Actually, I have a sponsored stream.

929
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,060
This week.

930
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,380
This week.

931
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,440
Um...

932
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm very excited about it.

933
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,860
Because it's a company that I like.

934
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,180
So I was like...

935
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,800
Wow.

936
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,900
And it's a series that I've wanted to get into.

937
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,620
Um...

938
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,180
So...

939
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,460
I guess I could say it.

940
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,680
I guess I could probably say it.

941
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,360
It's probably okay.

942
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,020
But, um...

943
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,380
I got...

944
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,020
A sponsor from...

945
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,800
From...

946
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,050
Marvelous!

947
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,320
Marvelous!

948
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,500
For...

949
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,260
For...

950
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,820
Rune Factory!

951
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,500
Wait.

953
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,840
Yes.

954
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,560
Hold on.

955
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,180
Let me double check.

956
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,520
I saw someone say Rune Factory.

957
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,180
And now I'm like...

958
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,320
Wait.

959
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,620
Was that right?

960
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,940
I'm so tired, you guys.

961
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,820
I just woke up.

962
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
There's a new one.

963
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,820
Is there not?

964
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,480
Wait, hold on.

965
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,260
Let me double check.

966
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,540
Why am I so like this?

967
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,620
Don't...

968
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,020
Don't...

969
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Don't look...

970
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,500
Sponsor people.

971
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,020
Please.

972
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,740
I'm too tired.

973
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,460
Wait.

974
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,740
Yes!

975
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,600
I knew it.

976
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,940
I was like, it is Rune Factory.

977
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,200
Yeah.

978
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:33,960
Yeah.

979
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,680
New, new.

980
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

981
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,680
There's the new Rune Factory.

982
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,160
I knew it.

983
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,320
I shouldn't doubt myself so much.

984
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,260
Yeah.

985
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,300
I'll know all about it on Saturday when I stream.

986
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,480
The sponsor.

987
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,500
Hmm.

988
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,240
So.

989
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,160
Yeah.

990
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,780
Wait.

991
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,980
This is my dream.

992
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,300
Oh.

993
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,360
As a huge Komono Friends fan, it was so cool to...

994
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,600
You got to hang out with Koyo Dyer and Hululu.

995
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,400
Yeah.

996
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,840
Yeah.

997
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:16,940
Yeah.

998
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,320
It was so...

999
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,340
They were so nice.

1000
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:19,980
Honestly.

1001
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,360
It was so...

1002
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,480
Surreal.

1003
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,860
And thank you for the...

1004
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,020
Thank you.

1005
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,520
It was so surreal.

1006
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,260
Meeting Hululu.

1007
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,180
You know?

1008
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,940
I think it happened at the same time that Paz jumped down.

1009
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,140
So.

1010
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,760
But, um...

1011
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:44,920
Yeah.

1012
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,740
Meeting Hululu with So.

1013
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,480
Because, you know, she's like kind of legendary.

1014
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,700
With Grapecon.

1015
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,920
So, I was like, wow.

1016
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,640
Oh, my gosh.

1017
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,680
I'm meeting the legend.

1018
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,100
The Grapecon wife.

1019
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,580
And

1020
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,250
she really is.

1021
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:11,550
Yeah.

1022
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,390
Who's Hululu?

1023
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,690
She's a penguin.

1024
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,590
Penguin character.

1025
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:17,910
Slash.

1026
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:20,650
Because...

1027
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,370
Camel V exists.

1028
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,850
So, slash VTuber.

1029
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,230
From Kimono Friends.

1030
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,970
And if you know the story...

1031
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,710
If you don't know.

1032
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,130
First of all.

1033
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,910
If you don't know the story about Grapecon, you should look it up.

1034
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,410
But if you do know the story, then you know that...

1035
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:34,850
That...

1036
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,070
That...

1037
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,510
How famous...

1038
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,970
How famous Hululu is.

1039
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,110
So...

1040
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,710
Yeah.

1041
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,710
I got to meet her.

1042
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,470
And Dire Wolf was so cute, too.

1043
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,490
And, of course, Koyo.

1044
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,730
I love Koyo.

1045
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,270
Yeah.

1046
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,530
The stream was really fun.

1047
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,830
There was...

1048
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,830
There's a part in the stream where, like...

1049
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,190
We play...

1050
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,050
The game where you...

1051
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,570
Close your eyes and you run away from the...

1052
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,470
From the...

1053
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,310
Or you try to catch the peep.

1054
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,530
You...

1055
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,170
You blind...

1056
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,790
You close your eyes.

1057
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,190
And you have a bat.

1058
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,070
And you try to whack the people.

1059
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,390
From hearing them.

1060
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,290
I'm not describing it very well.

1061
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,250
Just go watch the stream.

1062
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,950
Just go watch the stream.

1063
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:27,950
And...

1064
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,510
We had...

1065
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,710
We had rubber chickens...

1066
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,910
On our feet.

1067
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:34,730
And...

1068
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,010
And...

1069
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,450
I watched back on the stream.

1070
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,370
Because I was just like...

1071
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:37,710
Gosh.

1072
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,430
I want to know what they sound like.

1073
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,290
These rubber chickens.

1074
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,310
What do you guys hear?

1075
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,150
And...

1076
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,150
You guys don't understand...

1077
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,030
How...

1078
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,010
Actually...

1079
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:48,890
Loud...

1080
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,030
Those chickens were...

1081
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,450
In the room.

1082
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,350
They were...

1083
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,150
Even more loud than it was on the stream.

1084
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,150
They were so...

1085
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:01,550
Loud...

1086
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,260
It was...

1087
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,270
It was...

1088
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,150
My brain...

1089
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,410
Yeah...

1090
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,250
It was so...

1091
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,350
Oh my gosh.

1092
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,890
It was so, so stinking loud.

1093
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,310
Oh, sorry.

1094
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:16,890
I just...

1095
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,670
I just crossed my legs.

1096
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,730
And I realized...

1097
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,650
I don't think I can do that.

1098
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,320
Because my skirt will...

1099
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,430
Let's see if I can...

1100
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:24,850
Oh...

1101
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,890
You see it...

1102
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,710
It's okay.

1103
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,850
It's fine.

1104
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,350
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,590
So it was super duper...

1106
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,490
Super duper loud.

1107
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,210
And...

1108
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,590
Um...

1109
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:38,810
Uh...

1110
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,390
But...

1111
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,570
Please watch the stream yourself.

1112
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,790
Oh, let me link it again.

1113
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,680
Koyo...

1114
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,160
I don't know why my arms are doing this.

1115
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,880
Uh...

1116
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,100
Koyo...

1117
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,400
3D...

1118
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,800
Graduation...

1119
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,060
Celebration.

1120
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,560
Yes.

1121
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,260
Oh...

1122
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,860
And so...

1123
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,520
Um...

1124
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,200
That was also my first time...

1125
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,980
Using my new 3D.

1126
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,560
So it was a little bit of a sneak peek.

1127
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,380
But I also didn't realize how floofy my skirt was.

1128
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,140
I didn't know.

1129
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,410
I didn't know.

1130
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,810
Apparently even when I jump...

1131
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,610
Wait, let me try jumping.

1132
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,730
Let me try jumping real quick.

1133
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,240
Let's see if it does here.

1134
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,560
Okay.

1135
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,380
Yeah, I have to like recalibrate or something.

1136
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,580
I wonder if it's...

1137
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:00,720
Oh!

1138
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,680
Oh, that was actually me crossing.

1139
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,020
Oh!

1140
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,500
Oh!

1141
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,140
What if I take it off my head?

1142
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,540
Okay, let me try.

1143
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,400
3...

1144
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,580
2...

1145
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,020
1...

1146
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,300
1...

1147
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,720
1...

1148
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,880
2...

1149
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,920
Maybe there.

1150
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,220
I have to really jump though.

1151
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,540
I have to really jump.

1152
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,640
Oh!

1153
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,160
Like a jellyfish.

1154
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,590
Where did my chair go?

1155
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,390
That's fine.

1156
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,290
There we go.

1157
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,830
There we go.

1158
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,530
Yeah.

1159
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:28,850
She's it.

1160
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,510
I sit.

1161
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,810
I sit, I sit, I sit.

1162
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:39,550
Um, another thing that I noticed in Japan was...

1163
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,710
Choco Minto is so popular right now.

1164
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,090
So, there was lots of chocolate mint things.

1165
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,930
All around, and I was like...

1166
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,510
I feel so special.

1167
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,350
Um, you got your Switch too?

1168
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,730
Oh!

1169
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:55,650
Me too.

1170
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,590
I was like, what if I play Mario Kart World today instead?

1171
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,270
But I don't think...

1172
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,210
I don't think I have the mental capacity.

1173
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,350
I don't think I have the mental capacity to do anything.

1174
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:14,790
Um...

1175
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,700
And then I did a lot of things that I can't say yet.

1176
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,160
Can you throw it back?

1177
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,040
If I...

1178
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,140
If I...

1179
00:46:48,140 --> 00:47:09,560
If I...

1180
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,140
Oh, you really...

1181
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh, it's a different one.

1182
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,540
Oh, that was the sulky one.

1183
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,120
Wasn't there one earlier?

1184
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,460
Oh, pyro bug!

1185
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1186
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,600
Thank you, thank you for the big dodo.

1187
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,840
Thank you so much.

1188
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,320
Throw it back.

1189
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,350
Okay, hold on.

1190
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,860
Why do I look like a shrimp?

1191
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,420
What?

1192
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,400
Wait...

1193
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,470
What if I...

1194
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,860
I can't do it!

1195
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,260
I'm gonna spread my legs apart more.

1196
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,820
They need an ass tracker, clearly.

1197
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,300
They need to include that.

1198
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,180
I tried.

1199
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,320
I tried.

1200
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,960
Clearly an oversight, absolutely.

1201
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,960
What were they thinking?

1202
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,580
What were they thinking?

1203
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,320
Sorry that it's so scuffed, you guys.

1204
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,840
What about the armpits?

1205
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,420
What about my armpits, huh?

1206
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,040
What about them?

1207
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,520
What about them?

1208
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,620
I have to be careful when I...

1209
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,680
When I pull my chair.

1210
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,460
Wait, so...

1211
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,590
Like that.

1212
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:36,330
Hello, Mito.

1213
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,230
Hello!

1214
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,450
Hello, hello!

1215
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,070
Well, now I'm gonna take them.

1216
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,470
I needed to get more...

1217
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,730
The arms are getting worse and worse.

1218
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,970
Oh, maybe it's because of my...

1219
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,270
Oh, yeah!

1220
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,890
What if I take off my head?

1221
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,280
Hold on...

1222
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,780
Off with her head!

1223
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,910
Guys, am I spooky?

1224
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,130
Am I spooky?

1225
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,290
Oh...

1226
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,010
I think I'm broken.

1227
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:32,550
Wait...

1228
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,970
Guys, I think I broke the model.

1229
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:41,450
I...

1230
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,990
I think I need to fix it myself.

1231
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,510
One moment, please.

1232
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,750
Do...

1233
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:54,430
Do...

1234
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:55,910
Do...

1235
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:56,850
Do...

1236
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,450
Do...

1237
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,300
Do...

1238
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:01,500
Do...

1239
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,060
Do...

1240
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,140
Do...

1241
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:02,640
Do...

1242
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:02,680
Do...

1243
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,140
Do...

1244
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,560
Do...

1245
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,120
Do...

1246
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,500
Do...

1247
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,760
Do...

1248
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:30,820
Do...

1249
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,200
Do...

1250
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,280
Do...

1251
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:32,400
Do...

1252
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,640
Do...

1253
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,200
Do...

1254
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,360
Do...

1255
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,220
Do...

1256
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,740
Do...

1257
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,980
Do...

1258
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,340
Do...

1259
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,300
Do...

1260
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,460
It's kind of hard.

1261
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,230
Are you trying to see my back or something?

1262
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,500
That's better.

1263
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,700
Oh, yeah, baby.

1264
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,820
Yes, you wanna see my back?

1265
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,180
That's my back.

1266
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,760
That's my back.

1267
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:50,990
That's my back.

1268
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,250
You never see it.

1269
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,990
That's my back.

1270
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,070
Right there.

1271
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:01,830
Right there.

1272
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,710
Do your stretches, everybody.

1273
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,270
Do your stretches.

1274
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,820
Okay, okay.

1275
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,180
Okay, okay.

1276
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,980
I'm just clipping through my head.

1277
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,080
Taiskaru!

1278
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,120
Taiskaru.

1279
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:48,200
Ooh.

1280
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,630
Okay.

1281
00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:02,130
But yeah, I think I was saying that there's things that I cannot say yet for my trip.

1282
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,050
So, you'll go.

1283
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,350
Eventually.

1284
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,050
Eventually, eventually.

1285
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,170
Sorry, I'm having to fix my sleeves here.

1286
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,610
Too much movement.

1287
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:12,630
Too much movement.

1288
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,490
I'm all in due time.

1289
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:18,170
Yes.

1290
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,400
What could it be?

1291
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,840
What finger is that?

1292
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:32,880
There we go.

1293
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,300
That wasn't the middle finger.

1294
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,480
Wait.

1295
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,240
Can I do my middle finger?

1296
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:41,420
One.

1297
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,180
One.

1298
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,260
This.

1299
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,900
This one.

1300
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:44,380
Oh.

1301
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,000
Oh.

1302
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,640
Nope.

1303
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,800
That's everything but my middle finger.

1304
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,320
Guys, I'm not even putting...

1305
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,000
I think my...

1306
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,900
I'm possessed.

1307
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:55,820
Oh.

1308
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,360
Nope.

1309
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,300
not.

1310
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,020
Rock guy.

1311
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,620
Oh.

1312
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,720
What?

1313
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:10,660
What?

1314
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,080
What?

1315
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,730
Baby's first motor skills.

1316
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,330
Oh.

1317
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:19,610
Yeah.

1318
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,090
Baby's first motor skills, everybody.

1319
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,590
It's a little scuffed today, okay?

1320
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,610
Hey, bear with me, bear with me.

1321
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:31,650
Oh, oh my gosh, you guys.

1322
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,570
I have to talk about how much I hid in my hotel.

1323
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:41,250
I have to talk about how much my hotel was terrible.

1324
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:45,930
I won't say what the hotel is, but I won't be staying there again.

1325
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,930
Oh boy, we'll tell horror stories.

1326
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:51,770
Okay, first of all...

1327
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,850
Some days at 8 a.m.

1328
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,610
There would just be like banging, banging, banging, banging, banging, banging, banging.

1329
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,050
I don't know what it was.

1330
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:05,490
I don't know.

1331
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,970
I don't... I didn't... I don't know.

1332
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,370
It was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1333
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,630
At 8 a.m.

1334
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:16,730
and it would have... it would last for about like 15 minutes.

1335
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,470
I have... hold on.

1336
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:20,770
Hold on.

1337
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,450
I have a video.

1338
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,350
I don't know why my arms are like this.

1339
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:26,910
Sorry, guys.

1340
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,510
Hold on, I have a video.

1341
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:33,010
I can promise you, my arms don't do this.

1342
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,130
You saw my 3D.

1343
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,390
My arms didn't do this before.

1344
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,790
I think it's just today.

1345
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,510
Hold on, I have a video.

1346
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:43,170
Because I was like, what the hell?

1347
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,050
Why is this banging?

1348
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,750
And it was like, consistent.

1349
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,070
Okay, hold on.

1350
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,010
Let me try this one.

1351
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,070
Oop.

1352
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,230
I'm listening.

1353
00:56:58,970 --> 00:56:59,770
I'm listening.

1354
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:09,920
I don't know if it'll catch, if it'll, if it'll show up though in the video, in the, in, for you guys.

1355
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,230
I'm listening.

1356
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,120
Can you hear this?

1357
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,330
Can you hear it?

1358
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,560
It says, it's up as, as, as, as up as I can make it.

1359
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,700
A little.

1360
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,040
Slightly, yeah?

1361
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,840
And that's, that's on my phone.

1362
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,860
Can you imagine what it sounded like in here?

1363
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,440
Let me, let me, let me, I'll turn up my mic even.

1364
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,700
Actually, let me turn off the noise gate, too.

1365
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,080
Uh...

1366
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,020
Uh, ha, ha, ha.

1367
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,060
Uh...

1368
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,360
I'm gonna turn off noise gate.

1369
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:11,660
Okay.

1370
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,760
You're a soon.

1371
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,280
Thank you.

1372
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:20,510
Thank you, Blotch.

1373
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:22,410
Okay.

1374
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,650
All right, I turned up my volume a little bit.

1375
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,210
And now, I will play the video for you.

1376
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,220
Hotel's haunted, but not by me.

1377
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,500
It's still going, but you can't really hear it.

1378
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:13,910
Okay, it stopped.

1379
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:17,960
Yeah.

1380
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,300
Freaky, right?

1381
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,980
And it would do this at... it would do this at like 8am.

1382
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,040
Was it consistent?

1383
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:27,460
Yeah!

1384
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,020
Like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1385
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,580
And let's see, this one I took at...

1386
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,800
7.56am.

1387
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,300
7.56, 7.54.

1388
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:46,940
Wait.

1389
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,180
This one you can hear well too.

1390
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,840
And I think I go, what the hell is that?

1391
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,960
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1392
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,940
I go, what the hell is that?

1393
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:00,980
Hold on.

1394
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,760
Let me turn off the noise gate again.

1395
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,940
Okay, listen.

1396
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:04,880
Oh, sorry.

1397
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,520
Do you hear how loud that is?

1398
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,900
Do you hear how loud that is?

1399
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,920
It was so loud!

1400
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,640
I should have filed a complaint, honestly.

1401
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,120
I should have been like, what the hell, you guys?

1402
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:27,960
What is this?

1403
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,380
Oh, what the hell is this?

1404
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:37,620
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1405
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,570
Water heater.

1406
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,410
I don't know.

1407
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,030
I don't know.

1408
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:46,290
Ah, it was freaky.

1409
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,790
And it happened on like my first night there.

1410
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,190
So I was like, oh no.

1411
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:56,470
And, um, yeah, it's a hotel that I have always wanted to stay at.

1412
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,690
I was like, oh, Nancy Jew.

1413
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,640
Nancy, Nancy Dorusama.

1414
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,100
Nancy, Nancy Chan.

1415
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,100
Um, what was I saying?

1416
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:15,980
Hold on.

1417
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,480
Uh, yeah.

1418
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,880
And, uh, Nancy's summer.

1419
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,180
The real kind.

1420
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,660
Yeah, it was a hotel I've always wanted to stay at.

1421
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,820
But my view was total doo-doo.

1422
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,020
And then the elevators were so terrible.

1423
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,780
And, oh my gosh.

1424
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,160
Speaking of the elevators.

1425
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,880
Hotel VJF composed by Akira Yavok.

1426
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,540
There was, there was a one time.

1427
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,820
So there was, it was, it was a really big hotel.

1428
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,480
It was a pretty big hotel.

1429
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:59,380
And, uh, um, I, but the elevators were just terrible.

1430
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,720
Even though there were so many elevators, they were so slow all the time.

1431
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,860
And I was, uh, going to my room one night.

1432
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,780
And it was me, and a dad, and his son, and some other guy.

1433
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,780
And we were all waiting for the elevator to come.

1434
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,580
And, uh, after like five minutes.

1435
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,740
It took like five minutes.

1436
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,980
It was, oh, it was so long.

1437
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,920
Uh, there was, there was, there was finally an elevator that came.

1438
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:34,180
And, the guy, the guy that was the solo guy, he gets on the elevator.

1439
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:43,300
And then, pushes, pushes the closed door button on me and the dad's face.

1440
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,340
We, we, we were like walking towards the door and it just shut in our faces.

1441
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,180
And, we both look at each other.

1442
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,140
Me and the dad.

1443
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,420
And we're just like...

1444
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:00,600
We were like, and we just go...

1445
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,840
Uh, uh, and he goes...

1446
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:03,900
Uh,

1447
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:11,290
oh my gosh, it was the worst hotel.

1448
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:12,550
The people were rude.

1449
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,570
And, the hotel, the hotel was bad.

1450
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,790
And, the, the elevators were slow.

1451
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,050
And I was, I was just, I was like, I talked to the guy, I was just like...

1452
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,410
The dad, I was like, that surprised me.

1453
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:27,810
Why did he shut the door?

1454
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:30,090
And he goes, I don't know.

1455
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,930
Maybe he didn't see us.

1456
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:33,870
Oops, sorry, that was my mints.

1457
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:37,250
And I was like, what a, what an optimist.

1458
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:41,390
I got more Mintia voice mints, because they're so good.

1459
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:46,150
I went to, like, 20 stores to find these.

1460
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:47,030
Hmm.

1461
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:49,910
He can't see ghosts.

1462
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,050
I think so.

1463
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:56,070
I don't know if the guy that shut the elevator on us was Japanese.

1464
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,450
But the, but the dad was Japanese.

1465
01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,510
Hmm.

1466
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:00,930
So.

1467
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:02,530
Yeah.

1468
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:03,970
It was pretty funny, though.

1469
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,170
We were just like, ah.

1470
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,570
Because I was like, la la la, walking to the elevator.

1471
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,630
And then, then just, it shuts on us.

1472
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,270
And we're like, ah.

1473
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:13,850
Ah.

1474
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,440
Ah.

1475
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:23,640
Ah.

1476
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,420
Oh, no.

1477
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:25,780
Yeah.

1478
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:29,960
It was, it was not.

1479
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:41,000
And then also, they would have, like, signs by the elevators in the morning being like, oh, by the way, the elevators are going to get really busy around this time.

1480
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,420
So, um, so, uh, be careful.

1481
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,820
Uh, we, we, we don't know.

1482
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,500
Just, uh, deal with it, I guess.

1483
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,280
It was so bad.

1484
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,440
It was so, so bad.

1485
01:04:59,460 --> 01:04:59,580
Hmm.

1486
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,140
But, um, I guess you'll wait.

1487
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,500
Yeah, I, I guess.

1488
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,140
It's times like these that I'm glad I used the stairs.

1489
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,240
Oh, oh my gosh.

1490
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:12,960
I forgot also.

1491
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:13,860
Okay.

1492
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,660
Like I said, it was a very big hotel.

1493
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,960
One, I've always wanted to stay there.

1494
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,300
Two, I got a super, super good deal on it.

1495
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,680
Maybe because it's, nobody wants to stay there.

1496
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,300
Who knows?

1497
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,800
But, um, I'll give you an idea.

1498
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,340
It's, and I'm going to say this.

1499
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:38,080
If you know Japan, you know that, like, there's not very many, very many hotels that are, I guess, this, this big.

1500
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,220
But, like I said, I got a super duper.

1501
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,760
It was on sale, like, a lot.

1502
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,000
So, it was super duper good.

1503
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,340
And that's the only reason I stayed there.

1504
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,120
Um, I'm not just blowing money on expensive hotels.

1505
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:54,360
But, um, uh, I was on the 17th floor.

1506
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,080
Okay?

1507
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,560
The 17th floor.

1508
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,240
All right.

1509
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:00,900
17th.

1510
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,600
Very high.

1511
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:07,600
And I was, I, that's not even the highest, the highest, like, that's like halfway.

1512
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:08,840
Okay?

1513
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,660
That's like halfway.

1514
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,300
One night, I'm sitting in my room.

1515
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:26,080
And I, out of the corner of my eye, I notice something moving.

1516
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,020
It was an ant!

1517
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:31,480
An ant!

1518
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:31,780
An ant!

1519
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,520
On the 17th floor of this hotel!

1520
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:36,720
How?

1521
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:37,780
How?

1522
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,520
Where did the ant come from?

1523
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,640
How did an ant get onto the 17th floor of this hotel?

1524
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,840
I'm so angry.

1525
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,760
And it was, it was huge!

1526
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,620
This sucker was ginormous!

1527
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,880
Like, the size of my pinky nail.

1528
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,640
And then, I was also walking down the hallway.

1529
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,600
Sorry, I'm, I'm doing things with my fingies, but you can't see.

1530
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:23,600
I was walking down the hallway, and on the ground, I, I look at the ground when I walk.

1531
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,140
I'm looking down.

1532
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:30,160
A second ant.

1533
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,120
How?

1534
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,180
How are there two ants on the 17th floor?

1535
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,290
I'm so angry.

1536
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,430
I'm so angry.

1537
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,510
Same size?

1538
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:58,510
Yeah, I took a picture of it.

1539
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:01,910
I am never staying at this hotel ever again.

1540
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,750
But yeah, that's why I couldn't take the stairs, you know?

1541
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:08,910
I'm so tall!

1542
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:11,530
But, I'm on a tall floor.

1543
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:13,110
So.

1544
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:14,750
Yeah.

1545
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,210
At least it was on sale.

1546
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:18,510
I know!

1547
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,670
At least it was on sale.

1548
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:23,790
I'll never stay there again.

1549
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,990
And I'm so disappointed because I was really looking forward to it.

1550
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:29,750
Oh well.

1551
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:30,830
Hmm.

1552
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:32,230
Oh well.

1553
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,910
Um, what else?

1554
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:36,770
Uh.

1555
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:38,470
Uh.

1556
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:38,750
Oh!

1557
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:40,330
Um.

1558
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,050
Now I can talk about...

1559
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,910
Now I can talk about it.

1560
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,430
Now I can talk about it.

1561
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:56,310
So, I got to hang out with a certain wife of mine in Japan, of course.

1562
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:03,590
I'm talking about the lovely Takanashi Kiara of Hololive English Myth.

1563
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,230
And, um, I was hanging out with her.

1564
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,290
And, uh...

1565
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,290
Uh, we were both busy.

1566
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:17,710
So, we couldn't really do like an off collab or anything like that.

1567
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,370
I'm sorry.

1568
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:19,830
I'm sorry.

1569
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:20,370
Forgive me.

1570
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:20,850
Forgive me.

1571
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:21,310
Forgive me.

1572
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:22,450
Um.

1573
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:24,070
Uh.

1574
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,730
Hopefully, we can collab again soon though.

1575
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:27,610
I miss her.

1576
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,670
I miss her.

1577
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:29,850
I was kissing her on the head.

1578
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:30,630
I was like...

1579
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:32,590
Oh, kiwaba!

1580
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,430
Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh.

1581
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,450
That's what I was doing.

1582
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,310
I was like...

1583
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:36,310
Um,

1584
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:39,950
um, um, um, um, um, um, um.

1585
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:40,290
It's fine.

1586
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,010
You're on break.

1587
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:41,530
Mmm.

1588
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:42,410
True.

1589
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:52,730
And, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, actually, I didn't realize that she would be there.

1590
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:56,150
But, uh, Koseki Bijou...

1591
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:01,590
As you might have saw on Twitter, um, I got to meet her.

1592
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:02,710
And I've...

1593
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:03,810
I...

1594
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:13,830
People have said before in the past, like, oh, you should talk to Bijou about DMC or anything And I was like, I don't think she knows who I am, you guys.

1595
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:14,390
It's fine.

1596
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:15,110
It's okay.

1597
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:16,570
You know?

1598
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:18,090
And...

1599
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,490
But she knew who I was!

1600
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:21,630
She knew!

1601
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,690
I was so shocked.

1602
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:24,910
I was like...

1603
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,050

1604
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:27,290

I was like, you know Watashi?

1607
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:38,710
And so...

1608
01:10:41,130 --> 01:10:43,450
Minky is worldwide famous.

1609
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:44,210
Oh, yeah.

1610
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,330

She was showing me some DMC things on her bag.

1615
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,130
And, uh...

1616
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,950
And I was like, oh my gosh, these are so cute!

1617
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,130
Where did you get them?

1618
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:04,470
She was like, the Capcom store, girl!

1619
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,290
You gotta go!

1620
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:07,130

01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,010
Uh, Kiara was like, what are you gonna do after this Minto?

1624
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:14,750
Do you have any plans?

1707
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,080
Yes...

1708
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,840
That was their name...

1709
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,120
Yes...

1710
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:30,360
Yes...

1711
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:30,720
Yes...

1712
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,680
I was like...

1713
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,080
CUTE!

1714
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,120
I couldn't say it in front of her.

1715
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,660
But I was like...

1716
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:50,530
After she... After she left... I got to... I got to release... I got to release mine.

1717
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:54,310
I was... I was...

1718
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,250
PONMA CUTE?

1719
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:03,570
Yeah...

1720
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,870
Everybody's so cute.

1721
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,170
I'm only surrounded by cute people.

1722
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:17,090
But... And she gave me... She got like a box full of...

1723
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:21,770
These like wooden... Wooden... How do you say?

1724
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,330
Not keychains.

1725
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:24,150
Pins?

1726
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:27,250
Wooden pins... Like... The artwork is made out of wood.

1727
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:31,070
Of... Different Capcom characters.

1728
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:33,530
And she was like... Which one do you want?

1729
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,930
And I was like... I want... Phoenix Wright.

1730
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:36,670
Please.

1731
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:41,350
And... She... She gave me that one.

1732
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,590
She... She bought the whole box...

1733
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,950
Just so that she could get Virgil.

1734
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:52,490
She was like... She was like... I can't take any chances.

1735
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,650
I have to get Virgil.

1736
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:06,790
She's not wrong.

1737
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:07,670
Yeah.

1738
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:08,310
Yeah.

1739
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,670
I got a couple... I posted on Twitter.

1740
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,430
I got a couple... DMC plushies.

1741
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,870
And then I got some blind...

1742
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:19,050
Bag... Blind box things.

1743
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,910
And...

1744
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:24,390
Two of them were... Buttons.

1745
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,710
And I got one of... Lady.

1746
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:31,270
And one of... Dante with Lady.

1747
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,830
So I was very... I was very pleased.

1748
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:46,610
And... I got... There was... They were also doing a... Um... What's it called?

1749
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:51,770
Uh... Uh... Like a summer... Version of the boys.

1750
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,610
And... Um... All I wanted was Virgil.

1751
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,390
What I got... I was like... All I want is Virgil!

1752
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:01,590
If I get Nero... Of course I'll be so happy.

1753
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,070
I love Nero.

1754
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,510
If I get Dante... Of course I'll be so happy.

1755
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,070
I love Dante.

1756
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,990
But I just don't want V!

1757
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,840
The desire sensor.

1758
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,620
Ah... The desire sensor.

1759
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,750
I don't want... I didn't want V!

1760
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:22,570
Oh, sorry.

1761
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,590
I'm falling over.

1762
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:27,270
But sick boy.

1763
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,630
I'm gonna give it to Mogu.

1764
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,630
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give it to Mogu.

1765
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:35,630
And then... Ah!

1766
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:37,590
I'll have to go back and get some more.

1767
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:39,950
So that I can...

1768
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,730
So that I can...

1769
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:44,090
Try...

1770
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:45,330
For...

1771
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:46,390
Virgil.

1772
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:47,550
Yeah.

1773
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:53,250
But yeah...

1774
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:53,750
Let's see.

1775
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,250
What else?

1776
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,690
Uh...

1777
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:57,730
Uh...

1778
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,210
I wanted to go to Disney.

1779
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,410
To treat myself.

1780
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,670
I was too tired for Disney.

1781
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,550
So I didn't get to go.

1782
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,310
Mmm...

1783
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:10,150
What else?

1784
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:13,410
Mmm...

1785
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,490
Sorry.

1786
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:24,690
Uh...

1787
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:28,150
How did the 3D debut recording go?

1788
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:31,410
I will have more about that...

1789
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,090
Later.

1790
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,770
But it went very good.

1791
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,490
It was...

1792
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:37,290
Um...

1793
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:38,350
Everybody...

1794
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:39,410
Said I was crazy.

1795
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,490
Everybody saw my schedule and was like...

1796
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,090
Girl, you're crazy.

1797
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,270
How...

1798
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,090
How did you do all of this?

1799
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:50,970
In such a small amount of time.

1800
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:53,450
And I said...

1801
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:53,910
Um...

1802
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:54,830
I just...

1803
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:55,430
Did it.

1804
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:56,950
Hmm...

1805
01:17:58,650 --> 01:17:59,250
Wait...

1806
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,310
I'm trying to do ya...

1807
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,670
Oh, there...

1808
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:01,810
Hmm...

1809
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,970
Ha-ha...

1810
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,190
Hmm...

1811
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:07,250
So...

1812
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:08,930
Yeah...

1813
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:10,750
It was a lot, but...

1814
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,410
Oh my gosh...

1815
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:12,750
This arm is really bugging out.

1816
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,470
It's like going inside me.

1817
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,450
How do I fix it?

1818
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:18,710
Hmm...

1819
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,650
Oh wait, maybe this is why.

1820
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:25,490
Hmm...

1821
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,010
Hmm...

1822
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:26,210
Hmm...

1823
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,310
Look, it's like inside me.

1824
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:29,990
Wow...

1825
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,680
My handshooo...

1826
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:32,890
Whoa...

1827
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,690
My arms are bugging out!

1828
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,970
My arms are bugging out!

1829
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:38,410
My arms are bugging out!

1830
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:38,630
Well...

1831
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,450
Can't even see my arm, Pritch, cause my arms are just bugging out.

1832
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:43,010
Wait...

1833
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:48,260
Whoa!

1834
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:49,580
Why is it doing that?

1835
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,460
Hm...

1836
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:51,600
Hold on, let me reset again.

1837
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,960
Da-da...

1838
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,140
Da-da...

1839
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,260
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da...

1840
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,000
Are you guys ready to watch State of Play?

1841
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,200
Let me reset.

1842
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,210
I'm ready.

1843
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,110
Da-da-ding!

1844
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:14,700
Da-da-ding!

1845
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,580
I can't tell if that's better or not.

1846
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,140
Nah...

1847
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:18,400
I don't think it is.

1848
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

1849
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,160
I don't think that's better.

1850
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:22,620
Hm.

1851
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:25,700
Hm...

1852
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:26,800
It's fine.

1853
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:27,440
Maybe.

1854
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:29,720
Ya...

1855
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,480
...

1856
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,180
Let me...

1857
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,000
Ugh...

1858
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,440
Do I wanna stand up for this?

1859
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,240
So I can be all excited for things?

1860
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,120
Oh yeah, sorry, let me read it.

1861
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,340
Da-daaaay!

1862
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,020
I'll stand up.

1863
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,260
Woo!

1864
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,580
Sorry, I'm like... I'm spreaded.

1865
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,240
I have to so that...

1866
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,540
I can fix stuff.

1867
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,060
There we go.

1868
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:04,230
Everything good?

1869
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,770
Everything not good.

1870
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:09,250
My arm is all messed up.

1871
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:12,170
Still.

1872
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,670
I wish they made you T-pose in this, but they don't.

1873
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:17,270
Yeah, see?

1874
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,750
It should be like this arm, but it's not.

1875
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:20,470
Hmm.

1876
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,170
Hmm.

1877
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:23,710
Hmm.

1878
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:26,390
Hmm.

1879
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,570
It's okay.

1880
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,890
What's a little scuff, huh?

1881
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:34,230
What's a little scuff?

1882
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,830
Let me get...

1883
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:37,410
the...

1884
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:39,670
the...

1885
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:41,770
State of play up.

1886
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,690
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

1887
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,710
Ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

1888
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,110
Ba-ba-da-ba-da-da.

1889
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:51,850
Ba-ba-da-ba-da-da.

1890
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:51,870
Ba-ba-...

1891
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:54,450
Oh, I can't... I just realized I didn't have BGM this whole time.

1892
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,130
I'm so sorry.

1893
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,390
It's just a podcast at this point.

1894
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,110
Alrighty.

1895
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,390
Okay, okay, okay.

1896
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:06,510
Okay.

1897
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:07,450
Um...

1898
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:07,990
One moment.

1899
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,460
Okay.

1900
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,440
That...

1901
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,500
Wait.

1902
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,800
Is this it?

1903
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,740
Is this it?

1904
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,340
I think so.

1905
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,480
Let me make sure.

1906
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:28,340
Oh!

1907
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,740
I think so.

1908
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,220
Sorry.

1909
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,100
Sorry.

1910
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:37,880
Um...

1911
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,320
Okay.

1912
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:39,940
Then I do...

1913
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:40,080
Wait.

1914
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:40,420
No.

1915
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,200
This is...

1916
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,820
Now it's starting in the middle for some reason.

1917
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:44,060
No, no, no.

1918
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,080
Okay.

1919
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,660
Oh, my gosh.

1920
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:53,160
Oh, wait.

1921
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:53,440
No.

1922
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:54,000
This is...

1923
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,620
This is what I do.

1924
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,500
Studio.

1925
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,180
Window.

1926
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,040
Capture.

1927
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:01,520
Capture.

1928
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,740
State of Play.

1929
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,800
I was like, what is this?

1930
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,620
Biju Koseki Height.

1931
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,360
Sorry.

1932
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,500
I didn't think it was playing.

1933
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,220
Oh, you couldn't hear it.

1934
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,020
That's funny.

1935
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,280
I yelled for nothing.

1936
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,260
I yelled for no reason.

1937
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,740
Because you guys couldn't hear it.

1938
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,260
Maybe that's good.

1939
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,140
Let me get rid of...

1940
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:34,800
This.

1941
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,140
Maybe like that.

1942
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,300
Let's see how that looks.

1943
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,620
Let's get rid of YouTube a little bit more.

1944
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,960
Make it a bit bigger.

1945
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,680
Like that.

1946
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,710
She's hearing voices.

1947
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:54,510
I am.

1948
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,170
I'm hearing the voices.

1949
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,530
My arm.

1950
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,550
My arm's also hearing voices.

1951
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:04,530
I wonder why it's bugging out.

1952
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,250
Can't tell why.

1953
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:16,210
I probably would have to just recalibrate maybe.

1954
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:16,250
Maybe.

1955
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:17,490
Oh wait.

1956
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:18,090
Maybe this.

1957
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:19,950
Oh.

1958
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:20,870
That looks better.

1959
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:21,830
Oh.

1960
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,570
That already looks better.

1961
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:24,490
Okay.

1962
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:25,210
Hmm.

1963
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:26,910
Hmm.

1964
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:28,150
Hmm.

1965
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:28,890
Hmm.

1966
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:30,510
Hmm.

1967
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,080
Let's not accidentally flash you guys.

1968
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,160
Okay.

1969
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,600
Are we ready?

1970
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,500
Are we ready for state of play?

1971
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,770
Only on purpose.

1972
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,790
I'm gonna take off...

1973
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,890
The finger tracking.

1974
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,760
But now I have no finger tracking.

1975
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:09,660
So sorry.

1976
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,480
I'm just like...

1977
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,780
I'm doing the robot.

1978
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,620
She ripped off her fingies.

1979
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:22,320
Yeah.

1980
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,140
Yeah.

1981
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,520
I'm in karate mode.

1982
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,120
All right.

1983
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,080
Let's watch state of play.

1984
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,200
This is my first time watching.

1985
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,860
This is an hour long.

1986
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:41,700
Wait.

1987
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,160
I have to stand for a whole hour?

1988
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,320
I'll probably sit in the middle.

1989
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,100
I'll be honest guys.

1990
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,960
This is so long.

1991
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,840
What if I just skip some of the things that I don't care about?

1992
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,020
What if I skip some of the things that I...

1993
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:01,560
Okay, I'm gonna sit.

1994
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,110
Who is this?

1995
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:13,090
Who is this?

1996
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,280
What is this?

1997
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,300
Is it Tetris?

1998
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,860
The Tetris effect?

1999
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,920
No spoilers.

2000
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:29,780
Wait.

2001
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,620
Is it actually Tetris?

2002
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,040
No spoilers.

2003
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,340
Is it actually Tetris?

2004
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,080
I'm not allowed.

2005
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:41,120
Spaceman!

2006
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,720
What is this?

2007
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,020
I'm clapping.

2008
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:07,800
I

2009
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,970
can't tell what's going on in this at all.

2010
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,750
What is happening?

2011
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,390
Luminous Arise.

2012
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:33,450
Have you guys...

2013
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:35,130
Oh, I forgot to ask this before we started.

2014
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,410
But did you guys watch the...

2015
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,130
The state of play already?

2016
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:39,630
Or...

2017
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:39,890
Hello!

2018
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:41,390
Hello!

2019
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:43,970
Yeah.

2020
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:47,150
Not yet?

2021
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,710
Not as much together then.

2022
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:54,090
Ohhhh...

2023
01:26:54,090 --> 01:27:00,190
I'm gonna check and make sure the...

2024
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:01,910
Yeah.

2025
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:05,230
Prop is okay.

2026
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:05,290
Okay.

2027
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,690
Typical puzzle game stuff.

2028
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:16,250
Only the first 10ish minute time.

2029
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,510
You hated it?

2030
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,530
What if I didn't do one though?

2031
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:25,750
Thank you!

2032
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:26,490
Thank you!

2033
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,030
And enjoy the rest of the state of play.

2034
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:29,750
Thank you!

2035
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:30,990
Bye bye!

2036
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:31,190
Bye!

2037
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:34,770
Thank you!

2038
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,090
Bye bye!

2039
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:37,170
Wait, I can put the...

2040
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:39,570
As I'm sitting.

2041
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,490
What comes after dreaming?

2042
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:47,470
Have you ever had a dream where you...

2043
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:49,230
Have you ever had...

2044
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,470
Have you ever had a dream where...

2045
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,010
And then you...

2046
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:55,370
And when you...

2047
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,870
And then you had a dream...

2048
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:58,990
And in that dream you...

2049
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:01,000
Our third generation of Luna Filament...

2050
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:04,170
And advanced generative AI...

2051
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:04,630
Yes.

2052
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:10,030
Oh man, I just had one plug my headphones.

2053
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:15,110
We create life...

2054
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:16,160
For our future...

2055
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,030
Delphi Corporation.

2056
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:21,970
Delphi!

2057
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:24,550
What is this?

2058
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:25,890
I missed the entire thing.

2059
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,890
I took off my headphones.

2060
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,130
Let's see about getting passed through to Earth.

2061
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,830
Oh.

2062
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:32,630
And why are these things trying to kill us?

2063
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:33,950
Meow meow.

2064
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:41,410
There you are.

2065
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,660
Captured on PSY, bro.

2066
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,220
Oh my god, it's Death Stranding 2.

2067
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,520
Ooh, Capcom!

2068
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:58,250
Definitely.

2069
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:00,630
Whoa, whoa, hang on a second.

2070
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:03,450
Don't you have a name or something?

2071
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:07,490
She's D-I-7-5.

2072
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:09,070
Get behind me.

2073
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:09,970
Whatever she said.

2074
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:11,910
I think I can help.

2075
01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:14,030
Wow.

2076
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,050
Target identified.

2077
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:19,650
Neutralized in place.

2078
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,330
Neutralized us?

2079
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,830
The baby from Death Stranding grew up.

2080
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:25,890
Looks like we're gonna have to fight our way through.

2081
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:28,790
Like, actually.

2082
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:30,770
Bypassing first and second firewalls.

2083
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:31,950
Hooking control protocol.

2084
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:32,890
Dad's space.

2085
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:34,030
Initiating hacks!

2086
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:35,950
She's so cute, though.

2087
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:38,790
Pragmata.

2088
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:42,410
Cute!

2089
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:45,670
Hey, uh, D-I...

2090
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,890
I said I am D-I-0.

2091
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:48,710
Okay, okay.

2092
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,930
She's so cute, though!

2093
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:52,650
How about we call you Diana?

2094
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:53,270
Diana.

2095
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:54,090
What?

2096
01:29:54,710 --> 01:29:55,550
Diana?

2097
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,690
Just call her...

2098
01:29:56,690 --> 01:29:57,170
D.

2099
01:29:58,370 --> 01:29:58,790
Some...

2100
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:01,030
Diana.

2101
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:01,850
Oh.

2102
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,950
Was this supposed to come out?

2103
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:06,530
Wait, wait, wait.

2104
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,250
It's real...

2105
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:09,850
Real, lol.

2106
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,370
It's...

2107
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:11,790
It's...

2108
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:12,630
It's...

2109
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,910
It's real, lol.

2110
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:16,790
We...

2111
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:18,870
Wait, was this promised before or something?

2112
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:20,510
It got shelved.

2113
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:23,690
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

2114
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,250
That's so funny.

2115
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:27,430
Oh, hey.

2116
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:29,930
Today is Saturday, which means curry time.

2117
01:30:30,370 --> 01:30:30,610
Whoa!

2118
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,590
Curry time!

2119
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:33,990
Num, num, nummy!

2120
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:35,830
What does that mean?

2121
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:36,390
What is this?

2122
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,370
Rotoscoping.

2123
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:38,730
Okay, okay.

2124
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:39,770
I'm getting dizzy.

2125
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,560
Oh, my God!

2126
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,180
Who's gonna die?

2127
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,620
Romeo, listen up!

2128
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,820
Romeo, roll me!

2129
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:50,490
You're gonna die in 15 seconds!

2130
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,500
Seriously?

2131
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:52,480
Seriously!

2132
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,360
Don't worry!

2133
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,040
I made this just in case.

2134
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,000
The Dead Gear life support system.

2135
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:57,860
Don't move, okay?

2136
01:30:58,100 --> 01:30:58,800
What's happening?

2137
01:30:59,180 --> 01:30:59,540
Ehhh!

2138
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,320
Wow, Osmosis Jones!

2139
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,260
What's happening?

2140
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,740
What's happening?

2141
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:21,740
I'm really looking forward to cracking up.

2142
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,040
I haven't cracked up recently.

2143
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:27,100
From now on, you're dead man.

2144
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,120
Romeo is a dead man.

2145
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,980
I'm a dead man.

2146
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,480
Oh.

2147
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,620
They're like...

2148
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:49,820
Jambos.

2149
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:53,860
Oh!

2150
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:53,940
Oh!

2151
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:55,160
I'm gonna die!

2152
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,420
I'm gonna die!

2153
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,980
There's no way I'm dying!

2154
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,820
Wait, the...

2155
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:11,780
I actually like that they kind of did the bait and switch with the graphics.

2156
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:13,220
Oh!

2157
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:18,860
Whoa!

2158
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,880
Romeo is a dead man.

2159
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,120
Suda51 is...

2160
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:22,460
...of 2026.

2161
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,240
It feels very...

2162
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,940
Oh my god!

2163
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:26,620
Wait!

2164
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,400
Oh!

2165
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,080
Sorry.

2166
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:29,200
We'll just let it play.

2167
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:29,660
How's Grandpa's voice?

2168
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,200
Are you like...

2169
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:31,820
...a spirit?

2170
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,540
I'm on your back!

2171
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,300
Oh!

2172
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:34,860
What?

2173
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:34,880
What?

2174
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,340
Ah!

2175
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:38,840
There it is.

2176
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,440
Grasshopper.

2177
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:39,900
Hahaha!

2178
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:41,680
Ah!

2179
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:42,460
There...

2180
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,200
There it is.

2181
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2182
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,100
There it is.

2183
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:46,460
Konnichiwa.

2184
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,440
Konnichiwa.

2185
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,520
It's the man!

2186
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,280
Oh, it's the man!

2187
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,260
Yeah!

2188
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:52,320
Yeah!

2189
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:56,780
It's the man himself!

2190
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,220
It's the man himself!

2191
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,200
Suda51!

2192
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:07,140
Wow!

2193
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,760
He's not aged at all?

2194
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,060
Yeah!

2195
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,360
How old is he?

2196
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:23,120
What does he do when he turns 51?

2197
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,400
Wait, I'm gonna look up, but how old is he?

2198
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:25,960
We are trying to make a team.

2199
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:31,820
And why the title is Nomiya and Deadman?

2200
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,560
Please be sure to wait.

2201
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:38,540
It's over the 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, but thank you so much.

2202
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,960
And then, let's see if you want to play.

2203
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,160
He's 57!

2204
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:50,580
He's 51.

2205
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:53,980
51, 51, 51.

2206
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,620
This is... it's Fatal Frame.

2207
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,120
Not Fatal Frame, sorry.

2208
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,420
It's... Silent Hill F.

2209
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:06,120
Sorry.

2210
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,240
I keep calling it Silent Hill Fatal Frame.

2211
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,000
So in my brain, I'm like, Fatal Frame.

2212
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:16,840
It looks so good.

2213
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:18,620
This looks so good.

2214
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:20,420
Oh my god.

2215
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,540
Oh my god.

2216
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:41,980
It looks so good.

2217
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,280
It's like everything I ever could have wanted.

2218
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,980
Since I can't get another Fatal Frame.

2219
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,220
Maybe.

2220
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:49,980
Maybe one day.

2221
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,840
It looks too good.

2222
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:05,080
Oh my god.

2223
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:05,760
Freaky.

2224
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,940
Oh, it's like the mannequin...

2225
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:14,980
Oh my god.

2226
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,000
They look so good.

2227
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:16,700
Ah!

2228
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:18,760
They look so good.

2229
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:19,600
Oh my gosh.

2230
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:20,640
I'm so excited for this game.

2231
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:21,840
I'm so excited for this game.

2232
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:23,080
I'm so excited for this game.

2233
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:24,280
I'm so excited for this game.

2234
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,000
I'm so

2235
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:44,880
excited for this game.

2236
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,300
That's crazy creepy creepy creepy creepy creepy creepy...

2237
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:51,060
Oh, oh, hell no.

2238
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,580
Oh hell no.

2239
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,760
Oh my God.

2240
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:09,680
Oh, my God.

2241
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,640
They said the thing.

2242
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,080
The Higurashi thing.

2243
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,280
Ryuki, she's 7.

2244
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,480
Oh,

2245
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,460
she's so cute.

2246
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:41,440
She's so cute.

2247
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,920
She's so cute.

2248
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,300
I wish I could just scream right now.

2249
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,880
Oh, it looks so good.

2250
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:55,900
I need to sit down.

2251
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,220
It looks so good.

2252
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,560
September 25th, that's so soon.

2253
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:13,370
It's so soon.

2254
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:14,670
Oh, my God.

2255
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:14,870
Oh, my God.

2256
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,610
Okay, I can sit back down now.

2257
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:21,070
Sorry, I jumped out of my chair.

2258
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:21,870
The castle has been sighted again.

2259
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:25,030
The church's orders are absolute.

2260
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:25,970
Oh, I want to play so bad.

2261
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:28,930
These human sacrifices must be stopped.

2262
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:31,830
We will track the ethereal castle.

2263
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:33,670
Break its gates.

2264
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:37,290
And exterminate the creatures that dwell within.

2265
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:41,850
The demon lord himself will fall by our hand.

2266
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:45,970
This mission will test the limits of your courage.

2267
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:47,570
What is this?

2268
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:51,710
You will face horrors beyond your darkest imagines.

2269
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:54,050
It's not Castlevania.

2270
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:57,630
It's like so Castlevania, but not.

2271
01:37:57,850 --> 01:38:00,050
Creatures born of pure darkness.

2272
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:01,670
Bloodstained-a-vania.

2273
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:09,250
Wait, bloodstained?

2274
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:12,090
I thought...I was thinking of blood...bore.

2275
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,630
Sorry.

2276
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:18,970
Un, two, three!

2277
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,250
Oh no, he's fun.

2278
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:23,670
Oh no.

2279
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:29,280
Well, they get David Hayter again.

2280
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,600
Oh my God, the curry!

2281
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,520
We'll be here, David Hayter.

2282
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,660
I know he's in the...

2283
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:44,780
We start our mission!

2284
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,940
I know he's in the game.

2285
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:52,380
Dark...soul...born...vania.

2286
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:54,680
Bloodstained.

2287
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,480
Bloodstained, the scarlet engagement.

2288
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,920
Oh, I never played the first one though.

2289
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,240
I just know David Hayter's in it.

2290
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,280
The difference...the...the...the...the graphics difference between...

2291
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,380
Between the cutscenes...

2292
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:14,140
Right into the palm of my hand.

2293
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,240
And the...gameplay is so funny.

2294
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,520
It's giving me flashbacks to like Kingdom Hearts.

2295
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:19,740
You know?

2296
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:21,140
Oh, Bandai Namco.

2297
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,600
Shinjuku that I'm seeing...

2298
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:25,740
Are a hellscape I can't quite put into words.

2299
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,680
You've somehow been sent back in time eight years.

2300
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,740
But the situation here is critical.

2301
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:35,760
I'm counting on you, AJ.

2302
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,680
Oh, it's a Digimon!

2303
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,020
It's a Digimon game.

2304
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:47,820
Oh, cute!

2305
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:53,160
I'll always be right here with you.

2306
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,560
Who exactly are you working for?

2307
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,260
I can't!

2308
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:58,720
Okay, this is gonna sound really controversial.

2309
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:01,260
You really don't know anything about the digital world?

2310
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,880
The artwork is like a mix between Pokemon and Persona.

2311
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,960
But I know saying Digimon and Pokemon...

2312
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,280
Like comparing them is like...

2313
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,080
You know?

2314
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,560
But do you guys see what I mean?

2315
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:19,560
Like that outfit is so...

2316
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,960
Not Persona...

2317
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:20,980
Not Persona...

2318
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:22,100
That was very...

2319
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,060
Uh...

2320
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:25,920
Do the Titans not care about the end of the digital world?

2321
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:26,760
What's the name?

2322
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:27,980
Not...

2323
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,520
Uh...

2324
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,720
What is Not Persona?

2325
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,540
Shin Megami...

2326
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:33,860
Shin Megami Tensei!

2327
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,660
Shin Megami Tensei!

2328
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2329
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,460
That outfit in particular.

2330
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,080
I can't protect anyone.

2331
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,640
We must protect the world from them.

2332
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:45,820
Oh my god, she's so cute.

2333
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,980
But some of these characters look like they're from Pokemon.

2334
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,020
That's so strange.

2335
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:50,660
Please, everyone!

2336
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:51,660
Lend me your strength!

2337
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,180
It's do-da-da-da-da-digimon.

2338
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,400
You must fulfill our mission.

2339
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,880
It looks so good.

2340
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:57,280
Age it.

2341
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:03,400
Everything's coming out so soon!

2342
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:04,640
October!

2343
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,360
Toei Animation, I went there!

2344
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,580
Did you see my Twitter post?

2345
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:11,020
I went there.

2346
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,280
Patamon!

2347
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:14,720
I went there!

2348
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,000
Squeenix.

2349
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,720
I went there.

2350
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:26,750
Final Fantasy.

2351
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:35,450
Oh my gosh!

2352
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:38,010
You guys, I have a video to show you.

2353
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,990
Oh, actually, I don't think I can show you the video.

2354
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:43,530
I have a video to let you guys hear.

2355
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:48,350
Because it's me in the bathroom, but I'm not going to the bathroom.

2356
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:51,690
Can I pause this?

2357
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:52,670
Okay, hold on.

2358
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:54,250
Before I forget.

2359
01:41:54,670 --> 01:41:57,790
It's Final Fantasy related.

2360
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,790
So, they announced...

2361
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:01,790
Or rather...

2362
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:05,070
The Akiba Atore is having currently...

2363
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:07,150
A collab with...

2364
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,870
Or rather...

2365
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:10,670
Yeah, the...

2366
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,130
I guess you call it a collab.

2367
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:16,150
Is with the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

2368
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:17,790
And so...

2369
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:19,770
I went to Atore to pee.

2370
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:21,150
And...

2371
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:22,590
Just listen.

2372
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:23,550
This is the music.

2373
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:24,710
So, they play...

2374
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:25,750
When they do these, like, collabs...

2375
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:28,250
They play the music of whatever...

2376
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,750
That they're...

2377
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:31,350
Collabbing with.

2378
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:35,710
And...

2379
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:37,050
This is what it was.

2380
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:38,650
This was the soundtrack of my pee.

2381
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:41,170
Hold on, I'm going to turn it up again.

2382
01:42:41,670 --> 01:42:42,910
Hopefully it's not too loud.

2383
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:43,890
Okay.

2384
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,900
Can you hear it?

2385
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,680
I was like...

2386
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,140
All I want to do is pee in peace.

2387
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:13,040
Sorry, that's someone flushing.

2388
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:17,240
I don't think anybody was going to the bathroom in this, though.

2389
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,540
I think they were, like, washing their hands.

2390
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:20,340
I think I checked.

2391
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:21,440
I was like...

2392
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,380
The pee final boss music.

2393
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,020
Sorry, that made me think of that.

2394
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:36,820
Because of Final Fantasy.

2395
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,460
I was like, I have to...

2396
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:39,560
I have to record this.

2397
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:42,460
I have to record this.

2398
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:44,660
Okay.

2399
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,440
Final Fantasy Tactics.

2400
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,320
Oh, I saw, actually, people posting about this.

2401
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,840
Because they had, like, the cute little chocobo plushies.

2402
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,340
Your pee suddenly has a health bar.

2403
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:03,600
Wow.

2404
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,660
I could post the video.

2405
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,260
It's not me going to the bathroom or anything, so don't worry.

2406
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,640
Don't worry.

2407
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:10,960
Hi, everyone.

2408
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:11,560
Hiya.

2409
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:18,300
And I'm Syd Schumann, here to deliver news and release dates for games coming to PS5 later this year.

2410
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:19,620
Metal Gear.

2411
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:24,660
Final Fantasy Tactics.

2412
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:27,140
Call it the restroom, I'm fighting for my life type music.

2413
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,900
The game will include two versions of the original PlayStation Classic.

2414
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:36,780
The enhanced version, which features improved graphics, fully voiced dialogue, refined gameplay, and much more.

2415
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:38,360
How many weird recordings do you have on your phone?

2416
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:44,620
As well as the classic version, which brings a faithful recreation of the 1997 original to modern consoles.

2417
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,180
Not everything I record is for posting.

2418
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,620
Sometimes it's just for me.

2419
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,440
Final Fantasy Tactics, The Evil East Chronicles.

2420
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,220
The Evil East.

2421
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,380
The Evil Lies.

2422
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,580
And will be available for pre-order later today.

2423
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,920
This next game is something really special.

2424
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:06,840
When I first played it, I laughed so hard, I almost barfed.

2425
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,420
Let's check it out.

2426
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,980
You always take so many amazing things so proud of you.

2427
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:12,540
Thank you!

2428
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,380
Sorry, I just need to pee.

2429
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:16,620
Oh, that was me when I went to the Atore.

2430
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,840
Just go behind this bush, I'll wait.

2431
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:19,620
What is...

2432
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:20,420
I can do it right away.

2433
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:21,780
Pee shy.

2434
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,300
Pee shy.

2435
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:24,560
You can watch.

2436
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:31,740
In baby steps, all you have to do is carefully place one foot in front of the other.

2437
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,460
Which is easier said than done.

2438
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:33,900
No.

2439
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,920
This is rage bait.

2440
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,800
I will not fall for this.

2441
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:39,860
No.

2442
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,620
It's a captivating, open-world experience filled with oddball characters.

2443
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:44,660
No.

2444
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:45,280
No.

2445
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,520
A strand game.

2446
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,760
You found it even without a map.

2447
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,080
The best toilet on the mountain.

2448
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:50,740
Oh, good.

2449
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:52,240
No, I won't do this.

2450
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,800
No, this is a game for streamers.

2451
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:55,620
Definitely check this one out when it comes to PS5 on September 8.

2452
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,100
I won't fall for your propaganda!

2453
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,400
I won't do it.

2454
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,300
I won't do it.

2455
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:00,120
I won't do it.

2456
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:11,750
Hirogami is a unique action-adventure title from Bandai Namco studio Singapore.

2457
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,930
Oh, wow!

2458
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:17,730
In this journey to save your origami home...

2459
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:17,830
Ew!

2460
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:20,690
... you'll transform into paper shapes with distinct abilities...

2461
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:25,390
... including a paper airplane...

2462
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:26,210
That's a bird.

2463
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:27,050
A nimble frog.

2464
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,430
A hearty armadillo.

2465
01:46:30,670 --> 01:46:32,310
And a powerful ape.

2466
01:46:37,530 --> 01:46:42,250
Master the art of folding when Hirogami arrives on PS5 later this summer.

2467
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:45,290
What are birds if not plays?

2468
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:45,910
Oooo!

2469
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:47,610
Sid, why don't you tee this next one up?

2470
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:48,450
Thanks, Sean.

2471
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:53,870
The Hotshot series has been with PlayStation from the very beginning, and its latest installment...

2472
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:56,910
Aww, yeah baby, they announced this before.

2473
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:01,150
I'm so excited.

2474
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:02,490
More Hotshot golf.

2475
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:07,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2476
01:47:11,570 --> 01:47:12,450
Ooooooh!

2477
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,870
Oh, Pac-Man!

2478
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:20,190
Iconic Pac-Man?

2479
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:25,510
PS5, September 5th.

2480
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:27,790
Sorry, I'm clapping, but my hands are being weird.

2481
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:35,710
Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is a challenging new entry in the long-running action franchise.

2482
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:46,650
From the makers of the Blasphemous series, Ragebound stars dual protagonists from rival clans, forced to combine their souls and skills against a demon uprising.

2483
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:47,920
Souls?

2484
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:54,930
And long-time fans will really love the pulse-pounding soundtrack featuring guest composers from the original series.

2485
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:55,350
Ooh!

2486
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:58,390
Nice!

2487
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,250
Not the barrel-throwing man!

2488
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,560
I got one job!

2489
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,040
Ninja Gaiden Ragebound arrives July 31st on PS5 and PS4.

2490
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:18,040
Dun-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

2491
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:28,980
Oh, way...

2492
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,060
Wait, I kind of...

2493
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,560
I kinda vibe with this.

2494
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:34,540
Oh!

2495
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,360
Secrets!

2496
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,080
No, no.

2497
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,600
Marco, get away from my mountain.

2498
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,560
Wait, so there's a bencher?

2499
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:51,760
Oh, no!

2500
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:54,880
My gameplay got leaked.

2501
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,840
Oh, hey, I'm gonna try it.

2502
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,260
I'm gonna try it after stream.

2503
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,360
That's all from us.

2504
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,420
Vertical Death Stranding.

2505
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:11,300
I know, I kind of vibe with it, though.

2506
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,840
I kind of like it.

2507
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:14,220
I kind of like it.

2508
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,840
Nothing can prepare you for their next collection.

2509
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:18,380
Arriving later this year.

2510
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,280
We knew pretty early on that the game was fun to play.

2511
01:49:23,500 --> 01:49:24,720
People were excited about it.

2512
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:27,420
A new game collection.

2513
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,660
The most rewarding part of it is just seeing people react to it.

2514
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,080
Hello, uh...

2515
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:34,420
Cowabunga!

2516
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:38,480
Mortal Kombat.

2517
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:42,160
It was such a shock to see this game.

2518
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,120
I was like, I can't believe this game exists.

2519
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:56,420
It became something that added to the mystique of Mortal Kombat.

2520
01:49:58,520 --> 01:49:59,780
That's how I want to go.

2521
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:01,200
Get eaten by a dragon.

2522
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,000
Get eaten by a dragon.

2523
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,120
Ow.

2524
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:06,800
Oh, my God.

2525
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,620
Don't hurt your talent.

2526
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,200
Goodness gracious.

2527
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,040
Real.

2528
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:14,880
Thank you.

2529
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:21,640
There was no template to make the games.

2530
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,520
It's a bit of the Wild West.

2531
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:32,400
Every part of that game is an expression of who we were and what we wanted to do.

2532
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:51,940
Toasty... Toasty... Wishlist now... Toasty man, I don't know that one... Old

2533
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:09,300
MK meme... Oh... Oh... That's a... Oh...

2534
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,320
Wow... They've never made one before?

2535
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:14,340
Really?

2536
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,620
Huh... Fight Stick.

2537
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:19,200
Fight Stick.

2538
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,100
Oh... Oh... it's an enemy insurance.

2539
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:27,000
That guy?

2540
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:30,960
Know he's close... Where did he go?

2541
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,280
We lost sight of the enemy...

2542
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,900
We're under fire!

2543
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:37,560
Enemy position on top.

2544
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,700
Loading like this... That's a tradition!

2545
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:43,400
All right, Commander!

2546
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:26,720
Oh my god, I want to hug him too!

2547
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:28,760
I want to hug him too!

2548
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:39,650
Wait, what's this?

2549
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:41,170
Wait, there's more?

2550
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:45,190
I didn't even notice that guy was there!

2551
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:48,810
Oh my god, he turned into a...

2552
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:51,930
Online?

2553
01:52:52,330 --> 01:52:53,110
MGO online?

2554
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,030
MGO online?

2555
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:54,910
MGO online?

2556
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:56,750
MGO online?

2557
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:58,290
Wait, I want to watch it again.

2558
01:52:58,930 --> 01:52:59,470
MGO online?

2559
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:01,930
Why am I saying MGO online?

2560
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:02,710
I'm so stupid.

2561
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:03,690
Sorry, I'm so tired.

2562
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:04,810
My brain can't work.

2563
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:07,130
Hold on, I want to watch again.

2564
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:11,670
I'm saying ATM machine.

2565
01:53:11,790 --> 01:53:12,070
Control here.

2566
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:14,030
We have evidence of an enemy...

2567
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:19,230
Uh...

2568
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:19,610
Uh...

2569
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:22,130
Uh...

2570
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:23,310
Uh...

2571
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:23,530
Uh...

2572
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:24,030
No, he's close.

2573
01:53:24,910 --> 01:53:25,210
What?

2574
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:28,370
Uh...

2575
01:53:28,370 --> 01:53:29,190
The Crocs...

2576
01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:31,090
Oh, the Croccat looking so good!

2577
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:34,050
We've lost sight of the enemy.

2578
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:35,030
Find him!

2579
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:36,690
Stinky!

2580
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:38,490
Look how gross he is!

2581
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:39,890
He's covered in everything!

2582
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:42,910
We're under...

2583
01:53:42,910 --> 01:53:43,330
Oh!

2584
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:44,910
Oh, they're like...

2585
01:53:44,910 --> 01:53:45,530
Oh, I was like...

2586
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:46,850
I noticed he shivered and I was...

2587
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:47,270
Or like...

2588
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:48,170
He did like a weird movement.

2589
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:49,050
I was like, what is he doing?

2590
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:49,630
He's...

2591
01:53:49,630 --> 01:53:50,650
They're reading the magazine!

2592
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:52,130
They're being little perverts!

2593
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:53,550
Watch him.

2594
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:04,090
I can't look at him!

2595
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:25,050
Oh he looks so...

2596
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:25,210
Oh!

2597
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:28,230
He looks...

2598
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:28,350
...

2599
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:31,130
A-me.

2600
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:35,170
His name's A-me.

2601
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:36,230
A-me.

2602
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,470
Oh, gosh.

2603
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:40,610
Oh, I can't look at him.

2604
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:41,270
He looks...

2605
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:45,310
Oh my gosh did you see where I come behind?!

2606
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:58,090
Oh, gosh.

2607
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,380
I'm okay.

2608
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:54,480
No,

2609
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,320
my trauma.

2610
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:07,940
Wait, I kind of want to see how the fear looks.

2611
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:15,420
Oh, I guess he can... I guess he'll look kind of similar.

2612
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:18,580
Where, like, you can see his outline.

2613
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:21,460
Sorry, my arms are broken because I've...

2614
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,600
My arms are a little broken right now.

2615
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,380
Wait, he's like...

2616
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:35,920
Wait, they, like, ADR'd that.

2617
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,540
His mouth's not moving.

2618
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:40,080
You won't!

2619
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:40,540
See?

2620
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:43,770
He's talking, but...

2621
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:45,710
But...

2622
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:50,020
He's not moving his mouth.

2623
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,600
He's just that talented.

2624
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,480
He's just that talented.

2625
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:22,560
He's just that talented.

2626
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,040
There you go.

2627
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:24,880
Sorry, I keep pausing.

2628
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,320
Back to your own world.

2629
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:33,770
I keep thinking of the old angles for this one.

2630
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:34,430
It's so funny.

2631
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:37,610
Yeah!

2632
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:38,350
Yeah!

2633
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:39,250
See you in hell!

2634
01:57:40,230 --> 01:57:42,270
I'll grind you into...

2635
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:48,200
Show me Ocelot up the top watching us.

2636
01:57:48,940 --> 01:57:50,040
Show me.

2637
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:50,820
Show me.

2638
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,840
Wookie, wookie, wookie!

2639
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:54,320
Wookie, wookie, wookie!

2640
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,940
Wait, I'm dancing with them.

2641
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:13,400
Wait.

2642
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:14,860
Hold on.

2643
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:16,040
I'll do it again.

2644
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:26,330
Hidden monkey!

2645
01:58:27,910 --> 01:58:28,970
Weezy monkey!

2646
01:58:29,950 --> 01:58:30,630
Ah!

2647
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:31,470
He's the one!

2648
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:32,650
He's holding that monkey!

2649
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,380
Okay.

2650
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:43,460
MGO!

2651
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:43,920
MGO!

2652
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:44,400
MGO!

2653
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:45,440
MGO!

2654
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:45,900
MGO!

2655
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:46,440
MGO!

2656
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:46,920
MGO!

2657
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:48,920
MGO!

2658
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:50,660
They did it!

2659
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,960
You guys, we can play!

2660
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,980
We can play together.

2661
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:56,900
MGO!

2662
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:57,320
MGO!

2663
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:57,780
MGO!

2664
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,220
MGO!

2665
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,680
MGO!

2666
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:00,300
MGO!

2667
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:00,760
MGO!

2668
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,220
MGO!

2669
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,060
We can play together.

2670
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,180
Okay, let me...

2671
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,760
Before we continue, sorry.

2672
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,960
Let me reset again.

2673
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:13,160
I'm sorry.

2674
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:16,800
I got all broken because I kept falling over.

2675
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,420
You could say I was falling for a snake.

2676
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:29,060
Reset.

2677
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:29,820
Oh, wait.

2678
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,200
Oh, I think that did it, actually.

2679
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:41,430
Reset.

2680
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:49,320
I'm better now.

2681
01:59:49,580 --> 01:59:50,560
Let me get my chair.

2682
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,040
Oh, yeah.

2683
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:53,200
Okay.

2684
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,580
Ba-da.

2685
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:06,340
Ba-da-da-da.

2686
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:11,430
Spirit stones.

2687
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:17,730
Spirit stones imbued with humankind's never-ending dreams.

2688
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:20,230
Cool, Tecmo.

2689
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:24,110
Since time immemorial, this power has been...

2690
02:00:24,110 --> 02:00:24,890
Dynasty warriors.

2691
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:27,690
The impetus for human wars.

2692
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:29,930
Spirit...

2693
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:30,870
Why is she British?

2694
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,180
Spirit scones?

2695
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,680
It's the spirit scones.

2696
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:55,380
My favorite game, finally got its equal.

2697
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,940
That's not ace combat.

2698
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:01,140
What makes a shogun?

2699
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:03,780
Are you telling lies?

2700
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,400
Sneaky.

2701
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,240
Ninja.

2702
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,020
Naruto.

2703
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:40,720
Nioh, oh.

2704
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:43,900
Nioh 3.

2705
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:47,160
I like everything, it's unfair.

2706
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:50,520
I'm just teasing you.

2707
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:54,260
You can only like one game.

2708
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:58,040
Takechiyo.

2709
02:01:58,040 --> 02:01:58,640
Takechiyo.

2710
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:03,920
Konnichiwa!

2711
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:15,540
That voice did not come from that kid.

2712
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:20,940
If you think a voice that doesn't suit someone, listen to Japanese Raiden.

2713
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:26,380
People in Japan think Raiden from Metal Gear Solid 2 was so cool.

2714
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:28,200
His voice was really great.

2715
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,140
It did not suit him.

2716
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:42,990
But he is really cool.

2717
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:44,490
It suits him.

2718
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:46,190
That's it.

2719
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:48,990
That's it.

2720
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:53,710
No one knows how old the city really is.

2721
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:54,690
VR.

2722
02:02:55,150 --> 02:02:56,830
For me, it's all I've ever known.

2723
02:02:58,110 --> 02:03:00,050
My whole world.

2724
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:02,190
Oh.

2725
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:04,630
A public execution.

2726
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:09,650
I was raised in this city's shadow.

2727
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:12,990
Someone said that there was going to be a Ace Combat Zero remake.

2728
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:13,730
Shame that was fake.

2729
02:03:14,110 --> 02:03:14,150
No.

2730
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:16,310
To survive.

2731
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:25,550
I want to play Oblivion.

2732
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:27,630
That's me!

2733
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:31,070
That's me when I unlock a chest.

2734
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:32,590
That I'm really good at it.

2735
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:35,470
This city hides many lost and legendary treasures.

2736
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,690
Locked away.

2737
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:40,430
Waiting to be...

2738
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:40,930
Oblivion!

2739
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:43,290
You have violated the law.

2740
02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:44,810
Waiting to be taken.

2741
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:44,850
Stop!

2742
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:46,310
Stop!

2743
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:48,390
You have violated the law.

2744
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:51,930
E-Tina.

2745
02:03:54,490 --> 02:03:56,510
That was one thing also, you guys.

2746
02:03:57,230 --> 02:03:59,650
E-T-shirts were all over in Japan.

2747
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:03,150
Thief VR.

2748
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,490
Woah.

2749
02:04:06,210 --> 02:04:08,890
Yeah, there were E-T-shirts all over in Japan.

2750
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:10,290
I was losing my mind.

2751
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:12,210
I was like...

2752
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:12,950
Tidewalker.

2753
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:14,490
Are you there yet?

2754
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:16,190
Oh.

2755
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:18,450
Oh.

2756
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:23,270
It's so colorful.

2757
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:27,610
At first, I thought this was...

2758
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:29,150
Um...

2759
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:29,750
Uh...

2760
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:31,430
What's that swimming game?

2761
02:04:32,050 --> 02:04:33,310
The diving game?

2762
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:35,110
Where you...

2763
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:36,870
Are you crashing the alien planet?

2764
02:04:37,070 --> 02:04:37,370
It's gone!

2765
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:38,470
Someone beat us to it!

2766
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:39,070
Subnautica!

2767
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:39,490
Yeah, yeah.

2768
02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:40,530
I thought it was that at first.

2769
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:41,230
The guy?

2770
02:04:42,710 --> 02:04:43,150
Wait...

2771
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:44,790
Ever since the great flood...

2772
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:45,310
Elend...

2773
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:46,610
My dear planet...

2774
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:47,990
Has been dying.

2775
02:04:48,650 --> 02:04:50,350
I thought it was Subnautica at first.

2776
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:53,130
You're taking everything from us.

2777
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:55,070
But you type...

2778
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:55,890
There are a game that just showed...

2779
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:58,190
The disembodied heads to make you think you're playing every time.

2780
02:04:58,870 --> 02:05:00,470
And it's up to you now.

2781
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:01,810
Wait, you're just fall...

2782
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:02,230
Wait...

2783
02:05:02,230 --> 02:05:03,330
To use that power.

2784
02:05:03,370 --> 02:05:04,010
Is that Discord?

2785
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:07,110
Wait, what?

2786
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:09,130
Wait...

2787
02:05:09,130 --> 02:05:09,430
Hold on.

2788
02:05:11,650 --> 02:05:12,730
To you now.

2789
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:15,850
To use that power.

2790
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:22,200
To use that power.

2791
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,900
Was it me?

2792
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:26,820
To use that power.

2793
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:29,300
Sorry.

2794
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:30,700
I thought it was in the game.

2795
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,240
It was...

2796
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:40,620
But...

2797
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:42,120
I should have stream remote on.

2798
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:44,100
Weird.

2799
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:52,880
I thought maybe somebody accidentally...

2800
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:57,680
Had their discord open while they were airing this.

2801
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:00,480
You know?

2802
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:03,680
Silly... That's a fish.

2803
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:04,940
Silly.

2804
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,380
Silly state of play.

2805
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:08,900
Yeah, you.

2806
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:09,580
Me!

2807
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:12,100
Yeah, me!

2808
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:18,740
Tides of tomorrow... Hi, I'm Nicholas Doucet, the game director of Astrobot.

2809
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:21,900
It's a pleasure to be back today to share more news with you.

2810
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:22,380
No.

2811
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:25,160
What the last few months it has been in the world of Astro.

2812
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,500
Wait, more?

2813
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:26,680
Did you just say more news?

2814
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:32,640
After we launched last September to search encouraging feedback, even receiving a few others, we are truly greatly for.

2815
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:39,080
In October, we added five speedrun levels, followed by a Christmas special packed with festive surprises.

2816
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:48,520
And then earlier this year, the Vicious Void Galaxy made its appearance, adding yet more new challenging levels, out of which came at no additional cost.

2817
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:52,360
And today, I am pleased to announce that later this month...

2818
02:06:52,380 --> 02:07:00,400
You will be able to enjoy five brand new challenge levels in Astrobot, bringing the total to a whopping 90 planets.

2819
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:07,440
And new special bots will be there too, including Atsu from Ghost of Yotei, alongside other fans' favorites.

2820
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:09,420
But these ones are a surprise.

2821
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:16,580
And finally, the Astrobot DualSense wireless controller will return later this year, with a slight twist.

2822
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:19,180
So be on the lookout for more news coming soon.

2823
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:22,320
From all of us at Team Asobi, thank you all.

2824
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:26,940
Go for the amazing reception you gave our game, and enjoy the rest of the show.

2825
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:31,280
Astrobot!

2826
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:37,500
I saw somebody say that this, that I would really like this state of play, that it was like, made for me.

2827
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:38,940
You got Metal Gear!

2828
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,000
You got Silent Hill F!

2829
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:42,380
You got Astrobot!

2830
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,300
It's Peek!

2831
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:49,680
It's Peek!

2832
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,040
Oh shit!

2833
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,220
It's Peek!

2834
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,000
Come on!

2835
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:03,380
Hi, Red!

2836
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:22,840
Oh,

2837
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:42,680
pirate.

2838
02:08:58,140 --> 02:08:58,860
Crab.

2839
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,500
Why are they made of wood?

2840
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:15,080
Wood people.

2841
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:17,180
Wood.

2842
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:18,180
Her?

2843
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:18,780
Wood.

2844
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:24,920
Wow.

2845
02:09:29,530 --> 02:09:31,050
Sea remnants.

2846
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:35,890
I forgot to ask you.

2847
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:37,090
I just came really, really late.

2848
02:09:37,090 --> 02:09:38,470
How's the audio?

2849
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:40,550
We're like halfway.

2850
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:41,130
Oh!

2851
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:42,430
It's this game.

2852
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:47,270
Uh... It's good?

2853
02:09:47,430 --> 02:09:47,610
Okay.

2854
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:59,280
Or maybe I was thinking of a different game.

2855
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:04,020
Wasn't there a game like this?

2856
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:04,700
No?

2857
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:08,320
Nice, queen.

2858
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:12,400
Journey.

2859
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:13,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2860
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:56,480
Come on.

2861
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:56,680
Yes!

2862
02:10:56,860 --> 02:10:57,000
Yes!

2863
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:57,420
Yes!

2864
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,280
Yes!

2865
02:10:59,320 --> 02:10:59,840
Yes!

2866
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:01,240
Yes!

2867
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:01,460
Yes!

2868
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:01,800
Yes!

2869
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:03,540
Yes!

2870
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:03,820
Yes!

2871
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:05,380
Yes!

2872
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:05,640
Yes!

2873
02:11:05,820 --> 02:11:06,340
Okay,just.

2874
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:06,340
Yes!

2875
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:06,340
Yes!

2876
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:06,500
Yes!

2877
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:06,700
Yes!

2878
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:06,960
Yes!

2879
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:08,280
Yes!

2880
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:08,660
Yes!

2881
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:09,420
And here we go.

2882
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:09,640
Hello.

2883
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:09,900
Hey everyone!

2884
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:11,080
I'm Place One Zatani.

2885
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:16,620
That was a new look at Sword of the Sea, a visually striking adventure from the team behind Abzu and The Pathless.

2886
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:22,400
We're excited to announce that Sword of the Sea will launch this summer into the PlayStation Plus game catalog.

2887
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:30,680
On June 17th, Remedy brings otherworldly action to Game Catalog with FBC Firebreak.

2888
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:41,580
In this cooperative FPS set in the Paranatural World of Control, you and two fellow agents must confront and contain the reality-warping chaos found within the oldest house.

2889
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:49,540
Fun in short bursts or deep dives, FBC Firebreak launches day one in the Game Catalog on June 17th.

2890
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:51,400
Doom.

2891
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:53,120
I want to play that new Doom game.

2892
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:56,800
The PlayStation Plus Classics catalog welcomes several new titles this summer.

2893
02:11:57,900 --> 02:12:02,960
The PS2 version of legendary immersive sim Deus Ex arrives June 17th.

2894
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:04,140
No way!

2895
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:12,560
In July, Twisted Metal 3 and Twisted Metal 4 join the service just in time for the second season premiere of Twisted Metal.

2896
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,300
Wait, I wanted to play Deus Ex.

2897
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:17,240
It arrives July 31st in select countries, including Peacock in the U.S.

2898
02:12:18,940 --> 02:12:24,300
Additionally, two of Capcom's most beloved games from the original PlayStation are set to join the Classics lineup.

2899
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:30,880
Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 will arrive later this summer in the Classics catalog.

2900
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:39,240
Additionally, Myst and Riven will arrive later this month as part of the Days of Play celebration, running now through June 11th.

2901
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:47,020
Days of Play is a two-week event that includes bonus PlayStation Plus content drops, great deals on software and hardware, and more.

2902
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:50,780
Visit PlayStation Blog and PlayStation.com for full details.

2903
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,760
I was just thinking of that game the other day.

2904
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:57,400
His parents cut their own rope to save him.

2905
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:01,040
He watched them fall, then found his way off that mountain.

2906
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:04,580
Is this a Mount Everest Climbing Simulator?

2907
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:08,720
He then started a grand tour of every major boarding school in Britain.

2908
02:13:08,740 --> 02:13:09,640
Wait, did that just say Bond?

2909
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:11,960
James Bond?

2910
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:16,780
His superiors all praise his instincts.

2911
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:18,620
And they're all in need of early retirement.

2912
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:20,720
Nobody knows what to do with him, Mom.

2913
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:21,300
Seven.

2914
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:21,880
No.

2915
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:24,540
And I suspect he feels the same way.

2916
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:26,440
But what he did in Iceland...

2917
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:27,220
Jimmy...

2918
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:30,220
What he did in Iceland was insubordination.

2919
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:30,740
Jimmy...

2920
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:33,020
It was ill-disciplined, utterly reckless.

2921
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:36,020
He only survived thanks to blind luck.

2922
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:38,860
Give me one good reason to put him in the program, Mom.

2923
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:41,780
I think you just covered them all, Greenway.

2924
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:42,420
Ooh.

2925
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:44,220
It's really quite simple.

2926
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:47,320
Bond is a bullet without a target.

2927
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,360
Let's give him one.

2928
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:51,700
Tom...

2929
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:52,500
Tom...

2930
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:53,820
What the hell did they do?

2931
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:55,240
That lion...

2932
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:57,320
Do you have an appointment?

2933
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:58,320
The name's Bond.

2934
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:59,180
Tom Cruise?

2935
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,020
He's with me.

2936
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:01,840
And you are?

2937
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:03,600
Don't think we've had the pleasure.

2938
02:14:03,820 --> 02:14:04,060
Hello?

2939
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:05,300
Tom Cruise?

2940
02:14:08,160 --> 02:14:09,120
Tom Bond.

2941
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:10,200
Omega.

2942
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:11,580
Wait, oh god.

2943
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:14,020
It's all gonna be like, licensed stuff, huh?

2944
02:14:18,190 --> 02:14:21,250
We're facing a situation of the utmost delicacy.

2945
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:23,390
I need all my pieces on the board.

2946
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:25,750
Kelly.

2947
02:14:25,750 --> 02:14:28,210
Double O9 is a master manipulator.

2948
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:28,870
Double...

2949
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:29,210
Double...

2950
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:29,270
Nine?

2951
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:29,970
Nine?

2952
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:30,990
We won't see it coming.

2953
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:32,450
Nine?

2954
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:36,090
We went up two numbers.

2955
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:41,120
A mid?

2956
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:41,460
A flag.

2957
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:42,920
Kiss me every time.

2958
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:44,600
She's not your friend.

2959
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:45,180
Oh, la, la.

2960
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:45,980
She's an asset.

2961
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,420
With respect, Mom.

2962
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:48,920
To hell with that.

2963
02:14:50,780 --> 02:14:52,460
Blue O9 is another guy.

2964
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:54,260
No kidding.

2965
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,560
What?

2966
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:07,760
Fuck.

2967
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,800
Lately, headhunting.

2968
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:13,280
Huh?

2969
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:15,980
Why are you looking at her like that?

2970
02:15:19,370 --> 02:15:19,930
Huh?

2971
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:26,420
Women.

2972
02:15:26,660 --> 02:15:27,140
You know.

2973
02:15:32,150 --> 02:15:32,770
No!

2974
02:15:33,170 --> 02:15:33,290
No!

2975
02:15:33,690 --> 02:15:33,770
No!

2976
02:15:34,350 --> 02:15:34,470
No!

2977
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:35,650
No!

2978
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:36,170
Nine!

2979
02:15:38,830 --> 02:15:44,730
I suppose this is another... teachable moment... Nine!

2980
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,870
Earn the number!

2981
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:48,770
Wait, so do you go up?

2982
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:49,910
You don't go down?

2983
02:15:50,150 --> 02:15:51,410
You don't start as 001?

2984
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:58,730
You start at... wait... or... Yeah, so you start at like 001?

2985
02:15:58,730 --> 02:15:59,070
You start at 100?

2986
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:00,830
You start at 100?

2987
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:02,970
And then you go, 099?

2988
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:12,170
There's nine 00 guys.

2989
02:16:12,710 --> 02:16:13,950
They're titles.

2990
02:16:15,930 --> 02:16:17,910
They're showing off the watch again.

2991
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:21,730
Everyone!

2992
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:25,690
Everyone!

2993
02:16:26,030 --> 02:16:26,430
Everyone!

2994
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:29,210
Crafting an experience that honors the legacy of Bond.

2995
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:32,970
Harnessing our 25 years of agent expertise.

2996
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:36,850
This is just the beginning of our journey with 007.

2997
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:39,950
And we can't wait to share more with you soon.

2998
02:16:40,830 --> 02:16:41,990
Look at that smirk.

2999
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:45,650
That guy was like, mm-hmm.

3000
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:47,920
I can't do it right now, but...

3001
02:16:49,490 --> 02:16:50,630
001 is nuts.

3002
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:53,110
Nanya tried.

3003
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:57,070
How much more we got?

3004
02:16:58,150 --> 02:16:59,450
About 10 minutes more.

3005
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:07,420
Agent 80085.

3006
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:10,780
That's me!

3007
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:12,440
That's me!

3008
02:17:20,380 --> 02:17:21,360
Ghost of Minto.

3009
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:23,980
Yeah, this is the new Ghost of Tsushima game, though.

3010
02:17:24,020 --> 02:17:24,520
Still with me?

3011
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:25,560
I don't remember what it was called.

3012
02:17:33,110 --> 02:17:34,250
Ghost of Yotei.

3013
02:17:36,930 --> 02:17:37,990
Oh, a dog.

3014
02:17:41,440 --> 02:17:42,680
Oh, put that dog.

3015
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:44,200
Oh,

3016
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:47,440
boy.

3017
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:48,620
Easy, boy.

3018
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:49,260
Easy, boy.

3019
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:50,440
Easy, boy.

3020
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:50,960
Easy, boy.

3021
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:53,780
Bow, bow, bow, bow.

3022
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,100
Ghost of Yotei.

3023
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:02,660
Gameplay Deep Dive coming in July.

3024
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,900
It's an announcement for an announcement.

3025
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,280
Oh, is it, uh... Oh!

3026
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:22,740
Eh... Marvel fighting game?

3027
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:30,480
Oh!

3028
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:37,620
Oh!

3029
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:39,600
Wait, it looks awesome!

3030
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:42,520
Who are you?

3031
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:56,220
Daishori!

3032
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,960
Who are you?

3033
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:03,560
Who are you?

3034
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,660
Da- Star-Lord!

3035
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:10,740
La- Chris Pratt!

3036
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:14,540
Who are you?

3037
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:14,800
Oh!

3038
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:16,660
Oh, that's Ghost Rider, no?

3039
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:22,940
Yeah, baby!

3040
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:27,980
Ah!

3041
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:29,540
He has the ride!

3042
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:31,780
Ah...

3043
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:33,120
Doctor Doom!

3044
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:35,240
Doctor Doom!

3045
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:36,480
Doctor Doom's Free Fall!

3046
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:40,980
Uh...

3047
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:42,120
Wow, there's some...

3048
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:43,140
Oh!

3049
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:45,000
Damn, she's hot!

3050
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:46,860
Storm!

3051
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:47,980
Yeah, yeah, Storm!

3052
02:19:55,410 --> 02:19:56,810
This looks kind of awesome!

3053
02:20:01,470 --> 02:20:01,910
4v4!

3054
02:20:02,070 --> 02:20:02,530
That's crazy!

3055
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:06,610
Can you even tell what's going on in the screen?

3056
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:12,520
He looks so awesome!

3057
02:20:14,460 --> 02:20:16,240
NotEd основ as otros!

3058
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:19,960
Oh!

3059
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:22,560
Noted now, baby!

3060
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:22,900
Oh,

3061
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:27,800
Iron Man looks too cool!

3062
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,020
He looks too awesome!

3063
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:37,200
A little pause...

3064
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:46,760
We're going back to Metal Gear, baby!

3065
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:48,420
Oh...

3066
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:00,690
Yokohama...

3067
02:21:02,490 --> 02:21:03,130
Real...

3068
02:21:06,330 --> 02:21:07,610
Real footage...

3069
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:09,810
I was like, I'm gonna say this.

3070
02:21:09,810 --> 02:21:11,090
So I was first off with my friend...

3071
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:19,210
We had a question from S-S-E-R-P-R-E-U-P-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-S-E-R-E-R-E-R.

3072
02:21:19,390 --> 02:21:19,430
We introduced...

3073
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:28,170
We did have an episode of Marvel's game, which was...

3074
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:28,790
I was like, what is it?

3075
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:33,630
We lived in the universe.

3076
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:36,610
I first started collaborating with them.

3077
02:21:36,610 --> 02:21:40,270
It's a really famous IP, and I'm so proud of it.

3078
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:43,150
But first, I'm really worried about it in my company.

3079
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:50,350
It looks like...

3080
02:21:50,350 --> 02:21:53,210
It reminds me of My Hero Marvel.

3081
02:21:58,210 --> 02:22:00,110
I guess the character designs, you know?

3082
02:22:00,770 --> 02:22:05,870
The inspiration for working on this project really came from a place of pure fandom.

3083
02:22:06,510 --> 02:22:10,050
And wanting to say, why isn't PlayStation in this space?

3084
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:16,030
So PlayStation approached us with this vision to bring Marvel back to the forefront of the tag fighting genre.

3085
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:23,670
And that got us really excited because we've worked with that before on successful stuff like the Marvel Spider-Man franchise with Insomniac.

3086
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:24,770
But this actually looks good.

3087
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:33,230
When it came to approaching Marvel, you have to kind of first float the idea and let them know, hey, you know, we're thinking about approaching a company like Arc System Works to make a fighting game.

3088
02:22:33,230 --> 02:22:36,750
And we'd love to partner with you to do this really great collaboration.

3089
02:22:37,010 --> 02:22:37,630
Would you be interested?

3090
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:41,090
When they named the developer, that really perked up our ears.

3091
02:22:41,330 --> 02:22:49,270
It's always refreshing to work with a team that will take on the challenge of tackling Marvel, putting their own spin on it, and they're just uppercutting that challenge into the stratosphere.

3092
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:51,050
And that's what you get with this team.

3093
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:53,390
I mean, they couldn't make something boring if they tried.

3094
02:22:53,390 --> 02:22:57,470
If you want to make something really well, you can do it.

3095
02:22:58,870 --> 02:23:04,210
But, as far as I've been talking about, this is my favorite part of Marvel.

3096
02:23:04,490 --> 02:23:06,630
The tricky thing is that most fans...

3097
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:07,670
Is Spider-Man not Marvel?

3098
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:10,450
What about every single Spider-Man game that's...

3099
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:12,290
What are you talking about that they have no games?

3100
02:23:12,590 --> 02:23:15,330
Even if it's shovelware, they still have games.

3101
02:23:15,770 --> 02:23:20,310
Because you either do something like this vegan boy, or you don't do it at all.

3102
02:23:22,330 --> 02:23:26,650
I feel like I have a good grasp on their art style and how they would approach certain IPs.

3103
02:23:26,650 --> 02:23:27,570
That was so new.

3104
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:29,710
You come in with your kind of own expectations of...

3105
02:23:29,710 --> 02:23:34,430
See what I would expect to see from Arc System Works when they take on a Marvel IP.

3106
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:37,910
And what came up was something that went beyond that.

3107
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:52,370
They look so cool!

3108
02:23:57,150 --> 02:23:59,590
Ah, thank you for the breeze!

3109
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:00,990
Hello, hello!

3110
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:02,950
Sorry, my arm's almost over now.

3111
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:03,510
Yeah, hello.

3112
02:24:04,270 --> 02:24:05,050
Thank you for the breeze!

3113
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:07,270
I remember personally, the first time I saw...

3114
02:24:07,870 --> 02:24:09,050
Iron Man was really when I felt we had something special.

3115
02:24:09,050 --> 02:24:11,830
We're watching the State of Plague because I didn't get to watch it yesterday.

3116
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:12,090
We had something special.

3117
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:16,550
So, if you guys want to watch Iron Man's design, you can see the design of Iron Man's design.

3118
02:24:16,730 --> 02:24:16,870
Iron Man's design is too cool!

3119
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:20,690
It's a pretty Japanese-like Arc System Works-like design.

3120
02:24:22,930 --> 02:24:23,890
Looks too cool!

3121
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,190
It's so cool!

3122
02:24:25,430 --> 02:24:27,390
It's like, oh, this is this!

3123
02:24:28,150 --> 02:24:29,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3124
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:31,330
Iron Man is supposed to be this sleek fighter jet.

3125
02:24:31,490 --> 02:24:34,570
I think luxury race car mixed with a brick house.

3126
02:24:34,570 --> 02:24:39,070
And the fact that they added anime and mech elements to him just felt really natural at home.

3127
02:24:39,070 --> 02:24:39,190
He's a brick!

3128
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:40,350
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

3129
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:53,090
One of the mantras that we have for this project is from Japan to the world, and really trying to take not just the IP but gameplay mechanics and say, what can we really take from Japan, the creators that are doing awesome work here, and bring that to the global platform.

3130
02:24:56,970 --> 02:25:01,730
I like Iron Man's design the most.

3131
02:25:01,730 --> 02:25:02,230
I think.

3132
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:08,930
When ARK looks at these Marvel characters, it's not simply just the visuals.

3133
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:10,810
It's also the game plan mechanics.

3134
02:25:11,050 --> 02:25:12,030
Look at that dinosaur!

3135
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:16,170
But I also really like Ghost Rider's design too.

3136
02:25:16,410 --> 02:25:16,670
It looks really good.

3137
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:19,590
We've seen tag fighters that have 2v2, 3v3.

3138
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:21,990
We felt like we just had to go 4v4.

3139
02:25:21,990 --> 02:25:29,610
And in doing so, we found a lot of unique and fun ways to change up the gameplay that I think players are going to be very excited to see.

3140
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:30,530
Too much!

3141
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:33,910
There's too much happening on this screen!

3142
02:25:34,130 --> 02:25:35,790
The screen is like this big!

3143
02:25:35,970 --> 02:25:36,970
And there's...

3144
02:25:38,390 --> 02:25:39,390
Holy cow!

3145
02:25:43,890 --> 02:25:45,050
Too many cooks!

3146
02:25:46,150 --> 02:25:47,030
Too many cooks!

3147
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:48,790
You can play out as just the leader and 3 assist.

3148
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:53,350
Or you can tag in your assist to swap the leader and change the matchup on the fly.

3149
02:25:54,010 --> 02:25:55,610
I don't think a lot of people thought...

3150
02:25:55,610 --> 02:25:57,670
I like the way Ghost Rider plays too.

3151
02:25:57,930 --> 02:25:58,290
It looks cool.

3152
02:25:58,330 --> 02:26:02,670
Well, this has just been an awesome journey and I'm excited that we get to be able to share it with all the fans.

3153
02:26:02,830 --> 02:26:03,930
64 vs 64!

3154
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:05,270
So true!

3155
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:07,670
They never get to experience this level of production.

3156
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:12,310
And it's just a dream to even be working with these two great partners.

3157
02:26:19,030 --> 02:26:19,710
Oh, she cute.

3158
02:26:19,890 --> 02:26:21,630
She cute too.

3159
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:27,270
The three companies have come together to do this, and I think we really are going to make something magical here.

3160
02:26:30,770 --> 02:26:33,430
Oh, my arms are broken.

3161
02:26:38,770 --> 02:26:39,290
Oh, sorry.

3162
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:40,570
Oh, sorry.

3163
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:42,450
Stay tuned.

3164
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:43,550
Stay tuned.

3165
02:26:44,390 --> 02:26:45,670
I got to disappear for a second.

3166
02:27:01,270 --> 02:27:02,470
Is that it?

3167
02:27:02,750 --> 02:27:03,730
You're still with me?

3168
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:04,330
Oh, no.

3169
02:27:04,850 --> 02:27:05,430
Yeah, I am.

3170
02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:05,850
I'm here.

3171
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:07,470
Oh.

3172
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:09,110
Oh, that was it.

3173
02:27:14,110 --> 02:27:15,510
Snake, take this!

3174
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:17,510
The upcoming battle is truly unavoidable.

3175
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:21,010
Silent Hill.

3176
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:21,590
Silent Hill.

3177
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:21,950
Silent Hill.

3178
02:27:22,070 --> 02:27:22,390
Silent Hill.

3179
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:26,550
Show him again for me.

3180
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:28,670
Not bad.

3181
02:27:29,230 --> 02:27:31,550
I don't want to see this baby man.

3182
02:27:31,550 --> 02:27:31,690
Oh, man.

3183
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:49,580
Wow.

3184
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:53,900
Wow.

3185
02:27:56,100 --> 02:27:56,680
Silent Hill.

3186
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:57,100
F.

3187
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,340
What did it say?

3188
02:27:58,780 --> 02:27:59,300
September.

3189
02:28:02,270 --> 02:28:02,740
September.

3190
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:07,660
I remember...uh... It's like 20-something?

3191
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:08,640
25th?

3192
02:28:18,530 --> 02:28:19,450
2025.

3193
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:22,890
Thanks for watching.

3194
02:28:23,370 --> 02:28:23,650
Yay!

3195
02:28:27,230 --> 02:28:27,690
Yay!

3196
02:28:28,970 --> 02:28:29,850
That was fun.

3197
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:30,830
That was good.

3198
02:28:33,150 --> 02:28:34,890
Everything I liked was in it.

3199
02:28:35,050 --> 02:28:37,030
Now, once I have Silent Hill...

3200
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:38,950
and once I have Metal Gear...

3201
02:28:38,950 --> 02:28:41,030
and then even more Astro Bot...

3202
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:42,570
What am I supposed to do?

3203
02:28:44,130 --> 02:28:44,610
What?

3204
02:28:45,610 --> 02:28:47,630
What am I After Alive for?

3205
02:28:52,910 --> 02:28:54,370
Synapse, thank you so much for the alcohol!

3206
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:54,990
Thank you!

3207
02:28:55,830 --> 02:28:56,650
Thank you.

3208
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:00,920
Doom?

3209
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:01,960
Yeah.

3210
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:03,040
Doom.

3211
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:04,440
Doom.

3212
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,220
Yeah, Doom.

3213
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:07,260
It's a lot of video game.

3214
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:09,100
Yes, indeedy.

3215
02:29:14,340 --> 02:29:14,900
Oh!

3216
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:32,640
Yes.

3217
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:35,960
Well, guys...

3218
02:29:38,060 --> 02:29:39,180
Um...

3219
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:39,800
Probably...

3220
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:42,800
No stream tomorrow.

3221
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:45,580
But, um...

3222
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:46,680
I'll have one on Saturday.

3223
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:50,280
So, if you're like...

3224
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,880
Don't be doing it!

3225
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:53,780
Uh...

3226
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:54,760
I'll see you Saturday.

3227
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:56,680
And I'll be back to 2D.

3228
02:29:57,620 --> 02:29:58,300
2...

3229
02:29:59,220 --> 02:29:59,900
2...

3230
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,440
2...

3231
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:00,700
2...

3232
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:00,900
2...

3233
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:03,140
Why can't I ever get my fingers right?

3234
02:30:05,240 --> 02:30:06,720
I can't get them right!

3235
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:08,560
Whatever, it's fine.

3236
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:10,920
I'm gonna take it off.

3237
02:30:18,430 --> 02:30:19,250
I'm okay.

3238
02:30:22,390 --> 02:30:23,250
High five!

3239
02:30:29,770 --> 02:30:30,370
Hatsukashi.

3240
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:32,090
Big beat, so cute.

3241
02:30:33,910 --> 02:30:34,770
Good job.

3242
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:41,110
I'm right next to you.

3243
02:30:41,730 --> 02:30:42,970
I'm looking at you.

3244
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:45,670
I'm looking at you.

3245
02:30:46,950 --> 02:30:48,290
Are you being good?

3246
02:30:52,260 --> 02:30:53,500
Are you being good?

3247
02:30:56,280 --> 02:30:57,020
Hmm?

3248
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:09,630
Say thank you for that.

3249
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:10,670
Kazuma, thank you!

3250
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:12,970
Uh...

3251
02:31:12,970 --> 02:31:13,990
Your absence is...

3252
02:31:13,990 --> 02:31:15,570
Always acutely felt.

3253
02:31:15,910 --> 02:31:16,190
Ah!

3254
02:31:16,930 --> 02:31:17,750
Thank you, though.

3255
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:19,710
Thank you.

3256
02:31:21,790 --> 02:31:23,090
Welcome back, Vito.

3257
02:31:23,170 --> 02:31:23,750
Thank you!

3258
02:31:28,310 --> 02:31:29,050
So...

3259
02:31:29,050 --> 02:31:29,430
Yeah!

3260
02:31:30,170 --> 02:31:30,690
Um...

3261
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:32,210
This is fun...

3262
02:31:32,210 --> 02:31:32,590
And...

3263
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:34,250
Oh, let me...

3264
02:31:39,630 --> 02:31:39,920
Oh!

3265
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:44,100
Big...

3266
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:45,420
Break my toe.

3267
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:52,380
What's going on with my eyes?

3268
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:53,840
Ugh...

3269
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:55,340
Ugh...

3270
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:57,500
There's a little bit of glitchy stuff.

3271
02:31:58,280 --> 02:32:00,060
Just don't pay any mind to it.

3272
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:04,560
Don't pay any mind...

3273
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:05,880
To the glitches!

3274
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:08,680
No!

3275
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:09,500
No pay!

3276
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:20,900
I didn't even touch that.

3277
02:32:22,180 --> 02:32:22,680
Freaky.

3278
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:24,900
Freaky!

3279
02:32:26,300 --> 02:32:26,800
I'll...

3280
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:27,120
I'll...

3281
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:28,460
I'll stand up for the last bit.

3282
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:30,860
Oh...

3283
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:32,120
I think I might have to reset.

3284
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:33,460
But...

3285
02:32:40,590 --> 02:32:42,810
Thank you guys...

3286
02:32:42,810 --> 02:32:42,870
Thank you guys...

3287
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:43,510
For...

3288
02:32:43,510 --> 02:32:43,770
Our...

3289
02:32:43,770 --> 02:32:44,570
Streaming today!

3290
02:32:44,770 --> 02:32:46,030
Thanks for welcoming me back.

3291
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:46,910
Hopefully...

3292
02:32:46,910 --> 02:32:48,310
Even though there was some scuff...

3293
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:50,430
Hopefully it was still fun...

3294
02:32:50,430 --> 02:32:50,970
To...

3295
02:32:50,970 --> 02:32:51,870
See me...

3296
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:53,070
Wiggle around...

3297
02:32:53,070 --> 02:32:54,030
In 3D!

3298
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:56,150
I figured since I probably...

3299
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,330
I figured since I probably...

3300
02:32:56,330 --> 02:32:57,050
Um...

3301
02:32:57,050 --> 02:32:57,570
Hold on...

3302
02:32:57,570 --> 02:32:58,750
I'm fixing my mic...

3303
02:32:58,750 --> 02:33:00,230
I figured since probably...

3304
02:33:00,230 --> 02:33:01,030
I should...

3305
02:33:02,250 --> 02:33:02,930
Not...

3306
02:33:02,930 --> 02:33:04,970
Try to be so...

3307
02:33:04,970 --> 02:33:05,610
Well...

3308
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:06,910
I still screamed a little bit...

3309
02:33:06,910 --> 02:33:07,870
But I can't help it.

3310
02:33:08,530 --> 02:33:09,790
I just can't help it.

3311
02:33:10,450 --> 02:33:11,390
But I was like...

3312
02:33:11,390 --> 02:33:12,950
Maybe I can show my excitement...

3313
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:15,390
More of my movements...

3314
02:33:16,210 --> 02:33:17,970
Than anything else, so...

3315
02:33:19,490 --> 02:33:20,090
Yeah.

3316
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:27,420
So...

3317
02:33:27,820 --> 02:33:29,120
Thank you guys...

3318
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:31,440
And...

3319
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:32,080
Have a good night!

3320
02:33:32,340 --> 02:33:32,780
And...

3321
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:33,300
Have a good day!

3322
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:34,140
And...

3323
02:33:34,140 --> 02:33:35,060
I'll see you...

3324
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:36,160
When I see you next!

3325
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:38,000
Okaerii!

3326
02:33:38,260 --> 02:33:39,100
Tadai-ibo!

3327
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:42,020
Tadai-ibo Tadai-ima!

3328
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:48,870
Get out of here!

3329
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:49,990
Get out of here!

3330
02:33:50,070 --> 02:33:51,070
Get out of here!

3331
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:52,530
Get out of here!

3332
02:33:52,810 --> 02:33:53,190
Get.

3333
02:33:53,550 --> 02:33:54,150
Go!

3334
02:33:54,690 --> 02:33:55,230
Leave!

3335
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:57,670
Oh, my arms are broken again.

3336
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:00,170
Go!

3337
02:34:02,980 --> 02:34:03,300
Yeah...

3338
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:03,960
Get...

3339
02:34:04,380 --> 02:34:04,700
Leave...

3340
02:34:04,700 --> 02:34:06,080
Get out of my back, Calvin!

3341
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:39,290
Bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you, and bye to you,

3342
02:34:39,290 --> 02:34:39,810
and bye to you, and bye to you...

3343
02:34:40,170 --> 02:34:41,810
And why is my skirt broken?

3344
02:34:42,330 --> 02:34:43,170
What's going on?

3345
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:44,550
Everything's breaking!

3346
02:34:47,110 --> 02:34:48,150
Oh, that's why.

3347
02:34:49,170 --> 02:34:49,950
There we go.

3348
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:57,750
Bye to you and bye to you and bye to you and bye to you and bye to you and bye to you and bye to you.

3349
02:34:57,750 --> 02:34:58,230
Bye to you.

3350
02:34:58,790 --> 02:34:59,630
The viewer.

3351
02:35:00,190 --> 02:35:00,850
Hi dog.

3352
02:35:01,350 --> 02:35:01,390
Hi.

3353
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:02,270
Die!

3354
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:05,470
Okay.

3355
02:35:07,250 --> 02:35:08,470
Bye-bye.

3356
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:10,610
Bye-bye.

3357
02:35:11,430 --> 02:35:12,290
What's up, Vito?

3358
02:35:12,890 --> 02:35:13,770
What's up, Vito?

3359
02:35:14,350 --> 02:35:15,630
I'm gonna go sleep.

3360
02:35:16,470 --> 02:35:17,810
I'm gonna go be a baby.

3361
02:35:18,990 --> 02:35:20,250
Actually, I'm kind of hyped now.

3362
02:35:20,450 --> 02:35:24,350
I'm gonna go re-watch the trailer like 15 more times.

3363
02:35:25,770 --> 02:35:26,930
Times 100.

3364
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:29,750
Bye-bye.

3365
02:35:30,730 --> 02:35:31,630

Bye-bye.
