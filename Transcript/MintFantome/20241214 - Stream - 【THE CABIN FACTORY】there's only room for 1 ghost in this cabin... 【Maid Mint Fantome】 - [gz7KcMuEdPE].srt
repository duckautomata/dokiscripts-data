1
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,640
Wow.

2
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,460
Wow.

3
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,820
Wow.

4
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,460
Wow, long time.

5
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,020
No shame.

6
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,460
Welcome back.

7
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,300
I'm catching up on streams since I've been bedridden with Tommy Hort.

8
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,620
Oh, Avni.

9
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,140
Feel better.

10
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you for the super chat.

11
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,240
Welcome, guys.

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,900
Hello, hello.

13
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,280
Is there... Hold on, let me move my mic a little.

14
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,120
Oh, gosh.

15
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,620
I saw a Gengar pin at Artist Alley today.

16
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,500
It reminded me of you.

17
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,740
Very silly energy.

18
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,160
Did you get it?

19
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,650
Hello, hello, hello.

20
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,850
Intimate mic.

21
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm so close.

22
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,390
Can you hear me?

23
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,650
Can you hear me now?

24
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,630
Can you hear me like this?

25
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,430
This is not an ASMR stream.

26
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,850
Hopefully it sounds okay, though.

27
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,310
This is not an ASMR stream.

28
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,630
This is Cabin Factory, but it has no... It has no sound, so I don't actually know how to...

29
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,570
Welcome back, Minto.

30
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,370
What do you mean, welcome back?

31
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,830
Wow!

32
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,230
Jay, thank you!

33
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,850
Really wish I could go to the concert, but work.

34
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,270
Hope you have an amazing concert, Minky.

35
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,670
Thank you!

36
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,530
I'm so nervous.

37
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,270
And I saw that this game doesn't seem to be very long.

38
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,670
So I was like, oh, maybe to get rid of some nerves, I can...

39
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,450
What the?

40
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,250
I can do a karaoke or something.

41
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,530
I don't know.

42
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,250
I don't know, gosh.

43
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,590
I was... Oh my gosh.

44
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,250
I'm nervous, too, for some reason.

45
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,570
Why are you nervous?

46
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,250
I feel like... I don't have a heart, you know, because I'm dead, but I feel like this, like...

47
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,950
In my chest.

48
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,690
Like I'm so nervous in my chest.

49
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,310
It's going...

50
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,630
I'm so nervous.

51
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,350
If you're nervous, we get nervous.

52
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,670
No!

53
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,310
You have to be... You have to be confident, so I feel confidence.

54
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,550
Astro Bot.

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,510
I know!

56
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,410
Astro Bot!

57
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,710
Come back with the concert, Minto.

58
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,170
Wish I could watch the concert live, but I look forward to the snippets you and Doki pick out.

59
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,310
I think there will be people recording, too, so...

60
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:19,310
You know, not to say that you shouldn't go if you can, obviously, but like, you know...

61
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,870
I am Astro Bot.

62
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,670
Astro Bot.

63
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,910
I am Astro Bot.

64
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:34,970
Oh my gosh.

65
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,890
Maybe we should sing that in the karaoke.

66
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,030
Good luck, Minto.

67
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,290
You're going to do great.

68
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,190
Thank you.

69
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,310
Chibi Minto time.

70
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,170
No.

71
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,630
No.

72
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,330
No Ace Combat.

73
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,310
No Delta, but I was like, it's the game awards.

74
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,890
They're probably not going to...

75
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,610
They're not going to talk about Delta, huh?

76
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,070
Hi, Doug.

77
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,410
I did get it.

78
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,110
I was thinking about gifting it to you, but the policy says paper gifts only.

79
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,750
It said letters.

80
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,750
If you can slip it into an envelope.

81
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,010
I'm just saying.

82
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,290
But no, you should.

83
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,690
You should keep it.

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,230
I could go get it myself if I wanted to.

85
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,170
I could go haunt over there.

86
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,300
We got the Porsche Spaceship.

87
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:31,840
Oh my God.

88
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,640
I laughed.

89
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,180
I literally LOL'd.

90
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,060
I laughed out loud when I saw the Porsche Spaceship.

91
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,380
And I was like... And then it showed the Sony, like, CDs.

92
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,400
And I was like, this isn't a Kojima game, is it?

93
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,100
But then I was like, oh, it's Naughty Dog.

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,880
It's a Naughty Dog.

95
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,280
I wish I could attend the concert festa Black Winter.

96
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,020
I know you'll do amazing.

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,520
Thank you, Hoopties.

98
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,000
And Dracos, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

99
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,980
Thank you.

100
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,340
Naughty Dog.

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
Naughty Dog Dog.

102
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,580
No.

103
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,000
I really thought it was Kojima from the product placement.

104
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,580
I know.

105
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,800
Well, I don't know.

106
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,440
He would... If he could work with Porsche, he would though, you know.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,300
Probably.

108
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,120
Probably.

109
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
Anyway, should we play Cabin Factory?

110
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,140
We'll talk more when I do the karaoke, right?

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,860
Oh my god, I'm old!

112
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,570
Welcome to the Cabin Factory Corporation.

113
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:47,870
At the Cabin Factory, we pride ourselves in creating the best hyper-realistic horror cabins for the movie and theme park industries.

114
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,290
Starting today, you will be one of our cabin inspectors.

115
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,050
Congratulations.

116
00:07:53,210 --> 00:08:00,850
Due to a recent legal dispute that falsely claims some of our cabins are haunted, it's now mandatory to inspect every cabin to ensure the safety of all users.

117
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,890
It's important to highlight this claim is untrue and that we have had zero cases of serious anomalies proven to be the corporation's fault.

118
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,850
We're positive you will carry out these inspections thoroughly and professionally.

119
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,590
From the whole Cabin Factory Corporation family, have a wonderful first day as a cabin inspector.

120
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,330
By entering this elevator, you have accepted all the terms of your contract, which may be updated without notice.

121
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,190
Oh.

122
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,150
Hold on, I'm going to change, maybe, actually, this might be okay.

123
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,330
Oh, it's really dark.

124
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,230
It's really dark.

125
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,510
Oh, I can't see.

126
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,490
Okay.

127
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,750
Okay, okay.

128
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,550
The void.

129
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,090
Inspect the whole cabin.

130
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,330
If haunted, turn back immediately and press Danger.

131
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,470
If safe, press Clear.

132
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,170
Any movement means the cabin is haunted.

133
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,230
Gosh, this game.

134
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,050
Stop spooking me.

135
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,250
I didn't press Start.

136
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,310
Can you hear me, you think, reading the instructions?

137
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,800
Now this looks cozy.

138
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,120
Do you see me in it?

139
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,000
Haunted.

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,840
Just kidding.

141
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
Oh.

142
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,430
What's that noise?

143
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,260
Why does the cabin come with it's own wind sound effects?

144
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,200
Why does it come with it's own wind sound effects?

145
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,860
Guys, I think I'm spooked out.

146
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,560
No, I'm scared.

147
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,120
I'm scared, I'm scared.

148
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,660
Xenofold, is it your birthday?

149
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,900
Sorry I messed up.

150
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,020
I don't like it.

151
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,320
I don't like it.

152
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,780
I don't like it.

153
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,260
I don't like it.

154
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,640
I don't like it.

155
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,980
Oh god.

156
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,620
Oh no!

157
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,260
Oh my god, I feel like I'm in phasmophobia.

158
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,160
Why is it so dusty?

159
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,280
Does that count as movement?

160
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,090
Hey there demons.

161
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,910
Why is there an old lady?

162
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,810
The first one surely wouldn't be haunted, right?

163
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,140
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

164
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,900
I'm scared.

165
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,700
Coward?

166
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,460
I am.

167
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,180
I am just a ghost maid.

168
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,800
I don't deal with any cabin ghosts.

169
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,830
Can you die in this game?

170
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,390
I wonder.

171
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,390
Thank you SuperChat.

172
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,530
Thank you.

173
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,670
Oh my god.

174
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,190
Is he supposed to be there?

175
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,150
There is a man in my house.

176
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,780
He is not moving.

177
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,580
Hold on one second.

178
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,800
That's the cabin guy.

179
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,560
Oh god.

180
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,300
How big is this cabin?

181
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,380
Oh my god.

182
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,320
There is an upstairs?

183
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,100
That doesn't open.

184
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,060
He is eating a croissant and apple.

185
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,580
Oh I'm scared.

186
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,640
Guys I'm scared.

187
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,800
I don't know why this game is getting to me so much.

188
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,820
Maybe because it feels like Phasmophobia and Phasmophobia scares me.

189
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,720
That's not a croissant.

190
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,820
I mean what are you...a peel?

191
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,060
But it's bread.

192
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,380
It's bread.

193
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,880
For sure.

194
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,120
My birthday is on Sunday.

195
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,360
I'll be in my 30's.

196
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,720
31.

197
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,780
Can I get a happy birthday?

198
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,360
So early?

199
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,320
Let me get out of the cabin.

200
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,800
What if I just say clear.

201
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,240
Shift to run.

202
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh god.

203
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,600
Sunday is tomorrow.

204
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,780
No, it's Saturday.

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,700
Tomorrow for me.

206
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
Happy birthday!

207
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,520
Early birthday.

208
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,900
Ok, back to being scared.

209
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,620
You know what?

210
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,720
I'm just going to say clear.

211
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,180
We are going off ghost intuition.

212
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
I don't like how it gets so dark.

213
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,420
Nervous for tomorrow?

214
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,580
Maybe that's what's making me more nervous.

215
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,800
Because I'm scared of tomorrow.

216
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,680
I baked cookies for the line.

217
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,780
The lines for Vtuber panels today were massive.

218
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,600
Am I hearing something?

219
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,620
Am I hearing something?

220
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
Just the wind.

221
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,360
Guys, I made a mistake.

222
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm scared of this game.

223
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm scared of this game.

224
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,460
Wait!

225
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,960
I need the moral support.

226
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,860
Scary alert.

227
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,200
I need the moral support.

228
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,660
No, I'm so scared.

229
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,510
Oh gosh, I'm so scared.

230
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,590
Let me see.

231
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,010
Let me see if anybody is available.

232
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,430
This game doesn't look very scary at all.

233
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,030
What are you saying?

234
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,310
I'm scared!

235
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,850
I've messaged Matara.

236
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,270
She's the only person I can think of.

237
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,130
She's the only person I can think of that might be available.

238
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,850
Use the snake soundboard.

239
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,210
One good thing.

240
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,150
Yesterday's winter sale means Ace Combat 7 is on sale again.

241
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,730
Let's go!

242
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,970
It's so cheap.

243
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,670
Six dollars.

244
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,510
Matara is...

245
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,890
Matara is typing.

246
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:55,970
No!

247
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,790
She's not available!

248
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,650
Do at everybody.

249
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,450
At who?

250
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,990
Oh my god.

251
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,950
Nobody is available.

252
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:12,850
Kiwawa?

253
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:13,950
I don't know.

254
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,390
It might be difficult for her.

255
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,530
It might be difficult for her.

256
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,500
That game went back now.

257
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,800
Excited for your performance tomorrow.

258
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,700
Oh my gosh!

259
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,440
See you there!

260
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,600
I don't know why.

261
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,500
I'm so sorry you guys.

262
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,960
I didn't think that this game would be like this to me.

263
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,460
I'm so...

264
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,920
I was like, oh yeah, fast game.

265
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,160
Not fast if I'm a big ass baby about it.

266
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,600
Oh my god.

267
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,860
I'm so scared.

268
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,960
Wait.

269
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Did the door open from...

270
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,140
Oh, nevermind.

271
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,160
Guys, I'm too much of a baby.

272
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,940
There is no crouching in this.

273
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,900
Video game door.

274
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,260
I said, look behind you.

275
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,940
You know what?

276
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,440
You're right.

277
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,160
If Matara could do... Oh my god, that lady is staring at me.

278
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,440
If Matara could do PT, I can do this too, right?

279
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,340
I thought you were a Baachan.

280
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,220
What do you mean?

281
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,540
What does it have to do with anything?

282
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,430
I say it's clear.

283
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,410
Oops.

284
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,580
Wait.

285
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,160
Oh, so that was haunted.

286
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,360
By me, probably.

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,880
I was able to catch stream.

288
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,100
It's your birthday.

289
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,180
FarCry, happy birthday!

290
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
Happy birthday to you.

291
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,740
Happy birthday to you.

292
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,340
Happy birthday, dear FarCry.

293
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,420
PB&J.

294
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,580
Happy birthday to you.

295
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,940
Happy birthday!

296
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,400
I wish I was playing Exit 8 right now.

297
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,700
I was feeling it's not as scary of a game.

298
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,700
Oh god, you can do...

299
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,920
That was PT.

300
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,740
Guys, I have to be able to sleep tonight.

301
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,200
I have to be able to sleep tonight so I have enough rest for the concert tomorrow.

302
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,660
It's a cabin.

303
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,140
What?

304
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,400
I think it's haunted.

305
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,460
I think it's haunted.

306
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,220
Danger.

307
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,540
What?

308
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,360
What do you mean boop boop?

309
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,380
That was not a haunting?

310
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,340
How is that not a haunting?

311
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,120
Only movement.

312
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,740
The radio turned on.

313
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,120
By itself.

314
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,540
Okay, what if I played with no headphones on and then you guys told me if you heard something.

315
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,130
Oh my gosh, everybody said good idea, Mito.

316
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,910
Okay, I'm gonna take off my headphones.

317
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,530
Alright, now I'm brave.

318
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,330
What's this?

319
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,550
There is no guy here.

320
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,970
Wait, why is there no man?

321
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,370
Wait, why is there no man at the...

322
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,310
Wait, was the man a ghost before?

323
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,250
You heard something, what did you hear?

324
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,130
Wait, this is movement.

325
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,130
And this is the ghost.

326
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,250
And this is footsteps for real.

327
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
I think I died.

328
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,110
Guys, I think it was haunted.

329
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,650
It showed it getting closer to you.

330
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,210
I thought that was... I don't know what I thought.

331
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,310
Guys, tell me if you hear anything.

332
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,470
This is a group effort.

333
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,510
You guys are my moral support.

334
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,610
Oh, maybe he was the ghost.

335
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,610
Nothing so far.

336
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,150
Wait, this door is open.

337
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,590
It was not open in the first time we played.

338
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,010
You think it will shut?

339
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,210
Oh my god.

340
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:59,490
Oh, no, no, this is so...

341
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,130
So far...

342
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,710
Movement!

343
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,450
Movement!

344
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,290
Movement!

345
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,110
Movement!

346
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:04,890
Movement!

347
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,630
Movement!

348
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,550
Movement!

349
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,170
Movement!

350
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,390
Movement!

351
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,890
Movement!

352
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,550
Movement!

353
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,590
Danger.

354
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:10,990
Ping pong!

355
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,110
It was singing?

356
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,830
OK, I'll watch my VOD later you guys and then I'll be like...

357
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,770
That was so scary.

358
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,730
That was so freaky, right?

359
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,870
You guys hear anything?

360
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,990
Just the wind?

361
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,750
Just...

362
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,250
Not yet.

363
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,490
OK, see this is a group activity you guys.

364
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,530
This is a group activity.

365
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,790
This is good.

366
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,550
This is how we'll make it out.

367
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,910
We're making it through the cabins with this one.

368
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,410
Wait, you hear a goose talking.

369
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,470
She's not letting me out.

370
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,110
Move!

371
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:58,590
Move!

372
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,010
Move!

373
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,330
Guys, I'm in trouble.

374
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,450
Guys, I can't get out.

375
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,390
Guys, guys, I can't get out.

376
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,190
I can't get out.

377
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,850
There's a child blocking the door.

378
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,850
A door opened.

379
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,450
Oh, no, no, no.

380
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,740
Give her CQC.

381
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm not going through there.

382
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm not going in there.

383
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,060
I'm not going through there.

384
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,580
I'm not going in there.

385
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,340
I think I have to go in there.

386
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,300
Who gave grandma this job?

387
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,000
Grandma is going to die of a heart attack.

388
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,600
What is this?

389
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,220
Excuse me?

390
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,520
What?

391
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,220
Oh, no, no, no.

392
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,020
No, ma'am.

393
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,960
No, ma'am.

394
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,160
Red hot.

395
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
Is PT?

396
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh.

397
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,460
What do you think you'll find outside?

398
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,460
Oh, whoa.

399
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,840
Is this supposed to happen like this?

400
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,620
Where's the baby?

401
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,780
Why does it suddenly feel like...

402
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,360
It suddenly feels like Mortuary System.

403
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,680
Oh, god.

404
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,860
Oh, it's getting really laggy though.

405
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,140
Oh, come on.

406
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,460
Ganbare.

407
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Ganbare, PC.

408
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,400
I think I'm going to die.

409
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,380
I

410
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,610
couldn't...

411
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,310
You guys...

412
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,350
Oh, my god.

413
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,230
It wasn't just an effect.

414
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,750
It wasn't just an effect.

415
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,330
I didn't want to move because I feel like I'm in slow motion right now.

416
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
So haunted, it killed your PC.

417
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,360
I think actually.

418
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,400
Oh, we're back to normal.

419
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,360
Kind of.

420
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,620
That was actually a review I saw earlier.

421
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,340
Someone said it was kind of not very well optimized.

422
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,660
I was like...

423
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,720
I already put this on my schedule.

424
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:50,850
Okay, well that lady... Now we know if a lady comes at us, we just run and...

425
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,050
Alright, guys, you know the drill.

426
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,550
Do you hear anything?

427
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,130
Oh, my god, there's a hand under the bed.

428
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,270
That's a real hand!

429
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,170
That's a moving hand!

430
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,180
That was not good.

431
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,700
Danger, danger.

432
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,120
Okay, guys.

433
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm surprised I saw that.

434
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,380
You know the drill?

435
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,100
Oh, I guess it's not usually lit up, so...

436
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,200
You know the drill?

437
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,580
You know the drill?

438
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,060
A man.

439
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,280
That guy, he's always going to be munching on that...

440
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,700
On that bread.

441
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,720
Okay.

442
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,960
Seems safe.

443
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,080
Seems safe.

444
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,120
Clear!

445
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,420
Yippee!

446
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,080
You saw it.

447
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,940
I saw it.

448
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,340
What the hell?

449
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,540
I can already see... What is that?

450
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,940
Oh, it's a bunch of dolls and stuff.

451
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,920
Okay, here we go.

452
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,380
Teddy bear.

453
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,120
This is so cute!

454
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,740
Oh, wow.

455
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,500
There's so many of them!

456
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,660
Oh, there's a Minky!

457
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,280
Minky!

458
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,960
I don't see any movement.

459
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,900
This one looks very ominous, though.

460
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,320
Minky!

461
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,140
Minky!

462
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,860
Any dolls upstairs?

463
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,320
Just this freaky... Oh, there's Froggy Wawa.

464
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,580
Okay.

465
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,800
Go to the basement.

466
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,460
I don't think it lets you in normally.

467
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,800
I think that's a special event.

468
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,520
I think we're clear.

469
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,360
I think we're clear.

470
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
You have to check upstairs.

471
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,340
I did!

472
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,340
I looked upstairs.

473
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,380
You're missing some parts.

474
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:31,780
I am?

475
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,480
Am I really?

476
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,160
Is the painting looking at me?

477
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
No, I think she's normal.

478
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,460
You need to go up.

479
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Why do you guys hate me?

480
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,460
There's nothing up here!

481
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,020
It's a wall!

482
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,480
And a doll!

483
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,740
And another doll.

484
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,560
There's nothing up here.

485
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,300
I think we're safe.

486
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,640
You hate me!

487
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,120
Clear.

488
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:09,940
Alright.

489
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,050
Do you guys know the drill?

490
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,850
Do you guys know the drill?

491
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,710
Mutiny?

492
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,150
Why?

493
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,370
What drill?

494
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,830
The drilly drill.

495
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,530
Go, go, go!

496
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,290
He looked at me!

497
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,050
Go, go, go!

498
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,050
Danger, danger, danger!

499
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,830
Danger!

500
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,050
Love me!

501
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,360
Oh gosh.

502
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,910
Yeah, that is pretty accurate.

503
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,030
Someone notices me, danger.

504
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,190
Immediate danger.

505
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,430
Alright.

506
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,250
What kind of people are buying these cabins?

507
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,470
It says it's for haunted houses and stuff, but they are not supposed to be actually haunted.

508
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,730
They are just supposed to be silly haunted.

509
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,650
Not actually haunted.

510
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,290
Do you guys hear anything?

511
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,530
Nothing up here.

512
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,970
Oh shit!

513
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,890
We need to go, we need to go, we need to go!

514
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,390
Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady!

515
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,530
Lady, lady, lady!

516
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,290
Danger, danger!

517
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,330
Oh gosh!

518
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,530
Oh man, my...oh gosh, I'm actually getting goosebumps.

519
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,750
She ran to you?

520
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,330
No, she didn't.

521
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,190
Are the headphones still off?

522
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,170
She chased me!

523
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,490
Look, we only have three cabins left that we need to get through.

524
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,090
And then I can go sing karaoke!

525
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,650
And I can be happy!

526
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,950
And not scared anymore!

527
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,780
Unless you fail.

528
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,520
The lady is not in the portrait.

529
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,480
I think it's haunted.

530
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
But there was another thing I saw.

531
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,560
That was like another complaint.

532
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,220
About this game.

533
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Is that if you...

534
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,920
Say if I'm just like, oh danger right now.

535
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,720
They were like, oh unless you see the movement.

536
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,540
You can't report it.

537
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,940
So like...

538
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,400
So like...

539
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,700
Oh gosh.

540
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,220
Wait, do you think she left the portrait?

541
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,480
So no speed running, kind of.

542
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,220
Oh gosh, I'm scared though.

543
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,740
Of her not being there anymore.

544
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,310
He's looking at me!

545
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,470
I think that's...

546
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,090
She's eaten.

547
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,950
Oh she's got her own bread now.

548
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,410
Wait, is this a danger or...

549
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,250
They're not moving.

550
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,990
They're not moving.

551
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,510
He ate all of his food.

552
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,510
Oh my gosh, he's got pizza!

553
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,310
Oh my god.

554
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,110
I think this is like a...

555
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,550
Oh and we have another kid too.

556
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,530
I think this is like a new house.

557
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,750
New type of house.

558
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,730
But I don't think it's dangerous.

559
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,250
I don't think it's dangerous.

560
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,170
I think it's okay actually.

561
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,610
Okay, here we go.

562
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,190
Yippee!

563
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,590
Yeah, we got like the house lore.

564
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,070
So there's like the kid, the girl in the basement and...

565
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,290
Oh and she's back in the portrait.

566
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,290
Oh my god.

567
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,080
I'm looking inside.

568
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,500
I'm looking inside.

569
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,500
What

570
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,540
the...

571
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,760
I think there will be extras to this game.

572
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,920
Like DLC.

573
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,400
I wonder.

574
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,900
Was that always there?

575
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,740
I don't know.

576
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,060
I'm not sure.

577
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,140
Is that the exit?

578
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,080
I don't...

579
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,340
This seems like... We can go over that way.

580
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,900
To leave.

581
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,060
Okay.

582
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,920
Okay.

583
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,720
Alright you guys, let me know.

584
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,700
This game is really stressing me out.

585
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm not gonna lie.

586
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,180
I'm not gonna lie.

587
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm quite stressed.

588
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,500
Oh god.

589
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,100
But I'm doing my best.

590
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,920
I'm doing my best.

591
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,300
I don't think we saw anything.

592
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,180
Did we see anything?

593
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,920
You need to go upstairs.

594
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,820
I did!

595
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,120
Amy, shut up!

596
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,580
The cup is moving?

597
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,560
What cup?

598
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,920
This cup.

599
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,440
It is!

600
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,840
Oh my god!

601
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,660
Good eye.

602
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,940
Good eye!

603
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,600
That was sneaky.

604
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,960
That was so subtle.

605
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,480
That was so, so subtle.

606
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,280
Wow!

607
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,760
Guys, this is possibly our last house.

608
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,480
We gotta make it count.

609
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,260
We got one guy positive.

610
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,940
One guy positive.

611
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,080
I'm so...wow!

612
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,680
I'm so...

613
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,040
Wow, I'm really proud of you.

614
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,360
No,

615
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,200
no, no.

616
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,020
I don't like this one.

617
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,020
But the radio was on before, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

618
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,920
Yeah, the radio was in the chill house before.

619
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,880
The TV was clean last time.

620
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,800
Oh gosh.

621
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,020
But it could be that something moved and I said it was bad...

622
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,220
and I didn't get the actual thing.

623
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm scared.

624
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,920
I need to see the radio, I think.

625
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,780
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

626
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,520
Guys, hold my hand!

627
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,580
Hold my digital hand, please!

628
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,480
What

629
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,600
if we die again?

630
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm scared of dying.

631
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,000
So far.

632
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,360
Ok, the audio is repeating.

633
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,580
I know, I know.

634
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:50,800
I see.

635
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,400
I think it comes.

636
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,480
It doesn't seem to be moving.

637
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,780
It doesn't seem to be moving.

638
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,920
What was that?

639
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Oh, I didn't think that was a voice.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,200
Was it a cow?

641
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,320
I touched that dial.

642
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,220
I think it's clear.

643
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,580
Hold on, I'll do one last look over from the window.

644
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,480
I'll do one last look over.

645
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,320
Any subtle things that are moving perhaps.

646
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,300
A little bear looking around the fireplace.

647
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,800
Really?

648
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:49,740
Alright.

649
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,140
Gomito!

650
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:54,940
Clear!

651
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,780
We did it!

652
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,700
Oh my gosh!

653
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,720
We got balloons!

654
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,220
That is our exit!

655
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,820
Wait, we can kick these around.

656
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,940
I'm going home!

657
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,900
I'm retiring!

658
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,320
You'll never see me again, cabins!

659
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,180
This granny is gone!

660
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,000
Granny, don't go into the light!

661
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,340
Finish the work day.

662
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,400
This feels so mortuary.

663
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,620
Oh my god, credits!

664
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,960
Why are

665
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,370
there, like, credits?

666
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,930
What's going on?

667
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,610
Oh,

668
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,460
a narrator voice.

669
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,440
Nice!

670
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,800
Emergency operator.

671
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,640
I don't think we heard that one.

672
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,400
I was unfamiliar with your game.

673
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:47,940
Peek.

674
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,640
Quick, steal that choreograph for the concert.

675
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,800
It's actually so funny because one of the dances...

676
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,300
One of the dances we're doing is... I actually have a move that's like that.

677
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,920
City murmurs in the dark.

678
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,900
Game of the year.

679
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,380
Grandma's home.

680
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,900
Oh look, that's our froggy!

681
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,640
I like this music.

682
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm just a granny.

683
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,760
Is that

684
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,020
it?

685
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,580
We saw the opening credits.

686
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,900
Do I watch TV?

687
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,540
Being nobody.

688
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,440
No, grandma!

689
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:51,990
Fire!

690
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,010
Oh no, grandma was two days away from retirement.

691
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,110
No!

692
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,790
No, grandma!

693
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,780
You'd think that maybe she was one of the people in the fire.

694
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,460
She said not today, ghosts.

695
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,660
Oh my gosh, she just closed it!

696
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,180
I was gonna walk in.

697
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,120
Grandma said nope.

698
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,960
I believe in a work... work...

699
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,200
Play... work... what is it?

700
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,580
Work-life balance.

701
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,480
What's 30 left mean?

702
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:31,980
Maybe...

703
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,780
Maybe that's like how many anomalies?

704
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,580
30 unique cabins?

705
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,040
Holy moly.

706
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,660
30 variants left.

707
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,400
I did... enough.

708
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,860
I'll do... I'll do some... maybe.

709
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,300
Let's see.

710
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,140
Let's see what we got.

711
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,910
Grandma, no!

712
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,090
Grandma!

713
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,770
Guys, I think there is...

714
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,250
Wait, that's outside the window.

715
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,190
I'm outside the window looking at that guy who is outside the window.

716
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,950
Wait a second.

717
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,430
I'm out the window and he is out the window which means...

718
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,210
He is in here!

719
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,160
But who was phone?

720
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,480
I have to take off my headphones guys.

721
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,480
Alright, let's see.

722
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,100
I don't care if I die anymore.

723
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:12,920
I beat the game.

724
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,880
What are you doing?

725
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,020
What are you doing?

726
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,360
What are you doing out there?

727
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,060
What are you... actually he is not moving.

728
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,600
Zoinks Scoob.

729
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,160
I'm going to eat your croissant.

730
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,520
He is not moving.

731
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,900
He looks confused.

732
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,740
He really dies.

733
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,160
Zoinks.

734
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,640
Zoinks Scoob.

735
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,020
I think this is actually clear.

736
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,320
What?

737
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,820
It wasn't haunted at all.

738
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,800
Wait, hold on.

739
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,480
Oh no!

740
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,080
I thought I would be able to go into the elevator and see how many variants were left.

741
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,440
Also, very funny that this is floor 8.

742
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,140
Hello?

743
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,060
Oh there it is.

744
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,020
My computer is breaking because of this game.

745
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,820
You don't get it?

746
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,580
It's like an exit 8, you know?

747
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,940
Like the exit 8 and it's a very similar type of game.

748
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,060
OK, you guys know the drill.

749
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,580
Sorry, I have my headphones off again.

750
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,180
If you hear any...

751
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,480
Where did he go?

752
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,580
Where did he go?

753
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,700
He's not at the table!

754
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,840
Did he also leave?

755
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:47,890
I'm done with the game.

756
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:48,930
I think I'm done with the game.

757
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:51,450
I'm done with the game.

758
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,370
I'm done with the game.

759
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,590
I'm done with the game.

760
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:54,530
I'm done with the game.

761
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,190
Oh my god.

762
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,810
He really wasn't there.

763
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,390
He really wasn't there.

764
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,110
He really was outside.

765
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,860
Remember, it takes courage to quit.

766
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,740
You guys, I have a karaoke in 30 minutes.

767
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,660
I'll see you there.

768
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,440
Oh my gosh.

769
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,380
I'm shaking.

770
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,760
Holy moly.

771
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,760
Oh god.

772
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,460
I'm shaking.

773
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:01,400
I need to calm down and also drink some of my throat stuff.

774
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,400
So, it was he who was phone.

775
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,200
He was phone.

776
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,700
Nozatsu, we'll talk in the karaoke.

777
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,080
Don't worry about it.

778
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,660
We'll talk in the karaoke.

779
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,980
Well, that was a short, silly game.

780
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,740
That wasn't it.

781
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,780
At least I beat the game.

782
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,620
Greta does not believe in... Actually, no.

783
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,900
Greta is my queen.

784
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,300
She believes in work-life balance.

785
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,840
She said, not today, cabin.

786
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,680
Shuts the door.

787
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,380
And that's what we should all do, huh?

788
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,400
That's what we should all do.

789
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,320
I'm gonna go eat an Oreo that has a wisp on it and gain courage.

790
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,740
And then I'll see you guys for karaoke.

791
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,800
Otamito!

792
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,340
Thank you guys!

793
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,040
Short stream!

794
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:05,900
Yippee!

795
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,420
Bye bye!
