1
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,830
Welcome back, master and mistress!

2
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,990
I was just in a lobby with everybody.

3
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,630
And then, Rando started joining.

4
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,350
Doki was like, huh?

5
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,470
And we were like, hello?

6
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,110
And then, they were like, you shouldn't be in here.

7
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:03,990
And then, they were like, it's a public lobby.

8
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,630
So, I'm not in a room with anybody anymore.

9
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,930
That was funny.

10
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,750
Doki all of a sudden was like, who the hell is this person?

11
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,070
And then they were like, it's a public lobby.

12
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,470
Oh my gosh.

13
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,750
That was so funny.

14
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,110
I think everybody is kind of getting set up.

15
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,530
Hi, guys.

16
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,170
Hello.

17
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,370
Here we are in a room with us.

18
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,370
Today, I'm L.

19
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,670
I don't really know anything about...

20
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,630
About Death Note, but I just thought this face was too good.

21
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,650
Oh my gosh.

22
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,310
Oh, we have to wait for maintenance.

23
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,650
What is happening?

24
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,910
I'm L.

25
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,850
I'm L.

26
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,690
So, this game just came out today.

27
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,550
It's basically... It's like Among Us, but Death Note.

28
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,030
So, that's kind of fun.

29
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,810
Baby face.

30
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,170
Why do we always choose Tuesdays?

31
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,470
Why do we always choose Tuesdays for collabs?

32
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,770
It's a Steam maintenance, so...

33
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,630
I guess we'll just hang together until...

34
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,370
Until things are fine, I guess.

35
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,510
Because Garfield hates Mondays.

36
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,590
Oh, it's like 5 to 10 minutes long.

37
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:58,970
That's not bad.

38
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,850
We're just chilling.

39
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,490
I hope you guys are having a good day.

40
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:06,970
Jumpscare.

41
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,110
Is it maintenance time for Limelight?

42
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,610
Yeah.

43
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,910
Doki says she's explaining the rules to my chat.

44
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,410
Well, okay.

45
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,430
I'll do that too.

46
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,770
I'll do that too.

47
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,630
I'll be productive.

48
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,110
I'll explain.

49
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,950
I'll explain.

50
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,510
I'll show you guys.

51
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,990
I'll show you guys the rules.

52
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,550
I don't know how to play.

53
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,870
I did the tutorial.

54
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,350
What's training?

55
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,850
Oh, I think this is the tutorial.

56
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,710
I did it, but only for the investigator.

57
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,190
Okay, so you have the investigator.

58
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,710
Which are literally just the cops.

59
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,010
And then you have L, which is the main investigator.

60
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,970
And gives orders to investigators.

61
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,670
Hot dog.

62
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,910
Cute ghost made jumpscare.

63
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,110
And then you have Misa.

64
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,050
Oh, sorry.

65
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,370
You have Kira's follower.

66
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,170
Only one.

67
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,150
Kira really fell off.

68
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,470
The guy only has one follower.

69
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,490
And they steal investigator IDs for Kira.

70
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,610
And...

71
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,970
Maybe I should do the tutorial.

72
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,690
Because I'm just reading it.

73
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,850
Wait.

74
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,990
Steal investigator IDs...

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,730
Wait, no.

76
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,570
Oh my gosh.

77
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,970
Steal their IDs before they trademark them.

78
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,240
Steal investigator IDs for Kira and report those.

79
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,640
Making frequent contact with others.

80
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,740
Oh my gosh.

81
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,900
You have to report anybody who is social.

82
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,800
Being arrested while holding an ID will result in your removal from the game.

83
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,480
Oh my gosh.

84
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,180
She's stealing IDs.

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
And then of course you can be Kira.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,060
Use the death note to judge those whose true names are known.

87
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,080
So you steal the IDs so that you can get the true name.

88
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,740
And then you can kill people.

89
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,880
Isn't that exciting?

90
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,040
Oh my gosh.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,140
A little time to intro chat.

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,740
The fact that it says your ID may have been stolen everytime someone walks up to you freaks me out.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,240
I know.

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,420
That's what Vienna was saying.

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,860
Sorry, I'm reading the Discord chat.

96
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,300
But yeah, when you walk up to somebody, it'll be like...

97
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,120
Your ID might have been stolen.

98
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
It's so freaky.

99
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,360
According to Keikaku.

100
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,600
Do you guys know what Keikaku means?

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,640
Do you know?

102
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Do you know what Keikaku means anyway?

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Plan!

104
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,880
Keikaku means plan!

105
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,260
Isn't that so exciting?

106
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,180
Who are these bozos?

107
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,160
I don't want to be an investigator at all.

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,300
They look so lame.

109
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,260
This guy is so...

110
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,300
What was it?

111
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,500
Doki was saying that these are like the puppets that someone uses.

112
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,660
Is it this guy in here?

113
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,360
Hot dog!

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,700
Keikaku means hot dog.

115
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,060
Limo's Steam is back.

116
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,900
There is also...

117
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,260
The reason you might be wondering why aren't we in a group chat, a group call together or whatever.

118
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,460
There's in-game...

119
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,260
There's in-game voice.

120
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,680
So, we'll use that.

121
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,060
And I prefer that so much more because it kind of helps the chaos a little bit.

122
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,380
Do you guys want to see my character?

123
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,240
You have to pay for these ones.

124
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,980
Oh my god.

125
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,300
You have to pay for these ones, but this is my lady.

126
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,240
Looks just like me.

127
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
Yeah, I paid for these accessories.

128
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,720
But you have to pay... Oh my gosh, I want this guy.

129
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh, it's Mello.

130
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,080
Mello looks a little bit different.

131
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,160
Can be unlocked via customization track volume 1.

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,680
Oh, I have to pay for him too?

133
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,300
Oh my gosh.

134
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,000
Misa with the party is so cute though.

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,180
And look, there's like headwear.

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
But of course I gotta be this hat.

137
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,080
Gotta be the clown, I paid for it.

138
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,060
I paid for the clown, I gotta use it.

139
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,300
What?

140
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,120
Like a baby little santa?

141
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,620
A nurse?

142
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,920
The eyes are so freaky in this game.

143
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,580
They are so... They are so freaky.

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,160
Oh my gosh.

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,700
Oh my gosh, I want the... I want the nose.

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,750
Back.

147
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,030
Oh my... I didn't realize I had wings.

148
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,030
Nevermind.

149
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,210
Rem's wings.

150
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,890
Wow, I need that.

151
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,330
Wait, I could just carry... Oh, no, no, no.

152
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,230
I could just carry the death note with me?

153
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,070
That's kind of freaky.

154
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,590
Okay, confirm.

155
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,010
Nice.

156
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,860
Okay, Doki should maybe invite us soon.

157
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,240
I think.

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,140
Is this a kuso game?

159
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,020
I don't think so.

160
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,280
I think it's a legit game.

161
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,800
I think.

162
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,580
It just came out.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
So we'll find out today.

164
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,300
Did you know this game was supposed to be Resident Evil 4 and Light Yagami was going to replace Leon Kennedy?

165
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,920
Wow, they didn't go for it.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,760
That's crazy.

167
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh my gosh.

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,420
Amelie is like, I changed my name back to Have Mercy Daddy.

169
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,520
Don't be alarmed.

170
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
Chat rioted.

171
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,720
And then Doki is just like, why is Bao playing web fishing?

172
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,280
What does level 1 out of 40 mean?

173
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,040
Oh, you can unlock things.

174
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,720
Look at this.

175
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,060
We can get more... These are how you unlock the customizable things, but then these are the paid ones.

176
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
What are these?

177
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,100
I want the randoserudo.

178
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
Oh my gosh, sexy time.

179
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,520
Wait, these ones are kind of awesome.

180
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,240
Doki paid to become the Bishounen, but I wanted to be the little freaked out one.

181
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,860
Wait, I have to pay to get the Chuni eye patch?

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,720
No!

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,780
Why are these dot dot dots?

184
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,500
What does that mean?

185
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,220
I want the randoseru.

186
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,080
You have to choose between them, but I think eventually, the more you level up, you eventually get all of them.

187
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,000
Right, they seem to repeat.

188
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,720
They seem to repeat.

189
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,160
Oh wait, I didn't choose one.

190
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,860
You guys, which one should I choose?

191
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
Should I be L?

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,960
Wait, I have this on my profile head, don't I?

193
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,380
Wait, not my profile...

194
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,820
Should I be L?

195
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Misa is kind of freaky too, though.

196
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,100
Wait, we can see the details.

197
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,100
It's hideous.

198
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,140
It looks like a horrible baby.

199
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,960
It looks like the ugliest baby I've ever seen in my life.

200
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,960
My afterlife.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,680
Oh my gosh, she hasn't slept in years.

202
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,300
I think it's the lack of eyebrows.

203
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,760
Lack of... Oh gosh, it's just...

204
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,860
Oh my gosh, let's go with L.

205
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,420
Yay!

206
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,940
Oh my gosh, we can be... Wait.

207
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,020
This is the only thing I bought.

208
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,220
Even though, I think it looks better without... Even though I paid for the eye mask, I think it looks better without it.

209
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,040
I think it looks better without it.

210
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,220
The eyes are so far... It's so hideous.

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
It's so ugly.

212
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,420
Oh, just sent invites again.

213
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,080
I didn't get one.

214
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,810
I didn't get one, Doki.

215
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,610
Doki, I didn't get one.

216
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,470
I didn't get one.

217
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,330
I didn't get one.

218
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,650
Is this a sponsored stream?

219
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,050
No.

220
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,250
Would like to know if it's worth downloading.

221
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,050
I mean, you can watch it and then...

222
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,450
I haven't played it, so... I mean, if you... I might have a different opinion than you, though.

223
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,490
If you're just like, not my style.

224
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,210
Then, you know, whatever.

225
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,690
I think Steam is still weird.

226
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,190
Super cool the devs collabed with you.

227
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,850
I'm impressed they got the details on your... Hey, on my clown wig.

228
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,610
Hey, hey.

229
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,630
Hey, hey, hey.

230
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,910
Does it have single player?

231
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,450
It's... Oh, there it is.

232
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,510
It's minimum four players.

233
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,210
Wait, my invite is weird.

234
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,710
Same as Lime for me.

235
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,150
I got it, but it won't let me take the invite.

236
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,930
Steam invite scared you?

237
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,430
Yeah, I think it's like Among Us.

238
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,700
Toki having Steam issues?

239
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,720
I think we all are.

240
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,860
I think we all are having issues.

241
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,620
It's okay.

242
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
It's all good.

243
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,140
I'm just chilling.

244
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,620
How are you guys today?

245
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,600
How sponsored is this stream?

246
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,160
This stream is sponsored by you, the viewer.

247
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,000
And Gamersubs, code Boomer for 10% off your order.

248
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,040
This stream is sponsored by viewers like you.

249
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,440
Skip it.

250
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:39,900
Skip it.

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,920
Skip it.

252
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,420
Skip it.

253
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,040
But if I got a Gamersubs cup...

254
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,120
Would you get it?

255
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,480
You don't have to if you don't want to.

256
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,520
Sure.

257
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,760
Oh my gosh, that reminds me.

258
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,300
I never took out my money from Gamersubs.

259
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,660
I need to deposit that.

260
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,200
I never have since I've started.

261
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,200
Oopsie.

262
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,780
Let me see if it works.

263
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Oh, I can play now.

264
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,760
Let's go.

265
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,150
Hello?

266
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,490
It's not me.

267
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,370
I knew it.

268
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,010
I knew it's not me.

269
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:34,730
What do you mean it's not you?

270
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,930
It's not me.

271
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,150
I knew I wasn't the issue.

272
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,870
But you're different now.

273
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,030
Hello, you did it.

274
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,190
You did it.

275
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,670
We did it.

276
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,970
You did it.

277
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,750
Okay, okay, okay.

278
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,250
I'm gonna start inviting more people.

279
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,650
Okay, there is push to talk too, so I can talk to you guys still a little bit.

280
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,290
I love that you always choose Tuesdays.

281
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:01,850
I know.

282
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,950
I'll just keep happening.

283
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,030
Oh, wait, I'm not...

284
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,030
I wasn't...

285
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,790
How do I turn off... I had the push to talk turned off.

286
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,670
Now I don't know how.

287
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,410
It's V.

288
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,030
It's V, yeah, yeah.

289
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,910
If you wanna...

290
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,530
Yeah, but I had it where I didn't have to press it at first.

291
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,030
Oh, you go to settings and then you go to...

292
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,050
It's at the audio.

293
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,710
Oh, wait.

294
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,730
I'm gonna turn that off too.

295
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:36,870
Hello?

296
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,610
I have proximity chat.

297
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,030
Yeah, yeah.

298
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,970
Hey, we got you.

299
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,630
Oh my god.

300
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,210
Hello.

301
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,250
Okay, I'm turning up.

302
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,330
Oh my god.

303
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:46,930
Pay to win.

304
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,710
Let's go.

305
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,030
Okay, like...

306
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,290
You guys invite people or only...

307
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,210
Only I can... Is it only I can invite people or can you guys invite people too?

308
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,670
I don't know.

309
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,070
Let me see.

310
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,350
Is there a way to make it push to talk instead of like...

311
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

312
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,950
You go to settings and you click sound.

313
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,730
I'm on... I'm not on push to talk right now because we're setting up.

314
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,490
I don't think you can change it.

315
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,730
Yeah, I'll up the game a little bit.

316
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,630
I think I have to go to settings.

317
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,210
Oh, wait, here.

318
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:14,750
Settings, settings.

319
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,570
Oh, there you go!

320
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,130
We got Limu!

321
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:16,890
Oh my god, we got L!

322
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,870
Okay, Limu is definitely an L.

323
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,610
Okay, we're good.

324
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:21,890
Oh, yeah.

325
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,470
Hey, I'm L.

326
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:25,630
Yes, I am!

327
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,130
You're enjoying the fucking game and I get called a fucking nerd.

328
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:28,330
I'm L!

329
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,210
What are you talking about?

330
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,710
Guys, this is a dollar store L right here.

331
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,490
I'm L right now!

332
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,110
This is like bootleg L, right?

333
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,910
I'm literally L!

334
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,810
It's on my shirt!

335
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,870
It's literally on my t-shirt!

336
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,090
You look great.

337
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,470
You look like you took a soccer ball to the face.

338
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,010
No, I look like I got stung by some bees.

339
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,810
I'm having an allergic reaction.

340
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,390
Those dogs that got stung by bees and stuff?

341
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,570
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,170
It looks like you.

343
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,750
Okay, let me see who else I have.

344
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:10,850
It's kind of like if L started aging and then got into denial and just got way too much Botox over it.

345
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,030
Oh, no.

346
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,990
Too much fillers inflating my face.

347
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,230
Oh my god, you went to the wrong plastic surgeon, that's for sure.

348
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,150
Question, would this game not let anybody else have like... it wouldn't let me use the name Monarch.

349
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,510
Oh, really?

350
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,610
I don't know.

351
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,330
Like, you're not allowed to use that name.

352
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,010
And I went, huh?

353
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,710
That's weird.

354
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,290
Yeah, it was weird.

355
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,510
Yeah, I have like...

356
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,930
I don't know, maybe... I don't know if like...

357
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,450
I think these names... Maybe somebody else already named themselves Monarch.

358
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,630
I think these names are like... claimed.

359
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,950
You can claim names here.

360
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,890
Oh, I think so too.

361
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,710
So there's actual usernames here.

363
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,670
Honestly, some of these avatars look like dolls in like a Chucky movie or something.

364
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,830
It's actually horrifying.

365
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,990
I fucking hate it.

366
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,190
He uses these puppets.

367
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,670
They're ugly, but like...

368
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,730
Ugly.

369
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,290
But he's an orphan, so like, it's excused.

370
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,150
Wait, who made these?

371
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,510
Who?

372
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:11,850
What?

373
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,330
N, Nier.

374
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,190
Oh, Nier.

375
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,810
Yeah, okay.

376
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,490
Yeah, the L successor.

377
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,330
That's the blonde one, right?

378
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,790
The little guy.

379
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,290
No, that's Mello.

380
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:20,830
Oh.

381
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,550
That's Mello.

382
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,370
It's like the ones that people care less about when they jump the shark.

383
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,670
Wait, so he's the white haired one?

384
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,690
Yeah, he's the white haired one.

385
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,430
Oh my god, you gotta get your weeb card.

386
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,990
I literally um-atched you in anime lore.

387
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,990
That's so sad.

388
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,910
Look, I just got stung by 10,000 bees, okay?

389
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,670
My brain...

390
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,550
You let me um-atch you.

391
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,090
You just got out of the ER.

392
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,170
Yeah, I'm going through it, okay?

393
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,250
Do the doctors give you that little like, party thing?

394
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,110
Where they're like, oh, you did such a good job.

395
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,170
Here's a little toy.

396
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,750
I look like someone's... I look like someone's Gaia Online avatar.

397
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,390
I don't think I have Giga on Steam.

398
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,270
I think I added her, but I don't think she accepted it yet.

399
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,530
Let's see...

400
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,230
I invited her, but she's offline.

401
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,590
Whoa!

402
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,110
Yo, what the hell?

403
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,030
Yo, you wanna change it right?

404
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,490
Mike, what the?

405
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:31,690
I fucked Mike, oh god.

406
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,430
What was that?

407
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,410
Was that a bow?

408
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,030
Can we get a fucking, uh...

409
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,010
It's just static.

410
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,670
Oh no.

411
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,190
Is it better now?

412
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you gotta up your volume more.

413
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,650
I liked it though.

414
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,490
Turn it back, I could feel it in my teeth.

415
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,450
It's very nostalgic.

416
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,630
Yeah, it's like going to one of those old static TVs and opening your mouth right next to it.

417
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,670
I can even hear static.

418
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,910
Someone's connecting to dial-up right now.

419
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,730
Oh, wait, I think that's... wait, is it Juniper?

420
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,750
Is Juniper dial-up?

421
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,050
It should be.

422
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,630
Up my mic volume.

423
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,750
Wait, I'll mute, I'll mute.

424
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,410
No, okay, you're good, you're good.

425
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,650
You're okay, Juniper, you're okay.

426
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,730
You're not static.

427
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,170
Everyone talk one at a time so we can, like, single out the person.

428
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,750
Uh, Snuffy said... Snuffy said she wants an invite.

429
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,430
She needs an invite.

430
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,970
Oh, okay, I'll get her in.

431
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,250
Testing, testing.

432
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,630
She has to be online.

433
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,190
How's my volume?

434
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,110
How's my volume?

435
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,690
Your volume's good.

436
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,710
Oh my god.

437
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,810
I love this con lobby.

438
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,810
We didn't Discord Nitro Boost this, we didn't.

439
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,590
Is it worse?

440
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,110
Hi, hi!

441
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,350
Hello!

442
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,370
Hello!

443
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,550
Oh, Snuffy, you look great.

444
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,550
Oh my god, you guys look fantastic.

445
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,630
Okay, who didn't do the tutorial?

446
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,090
Who didn't?

447
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,250
I didn't do the tutorial.

448
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,550
I'll give you guys a quick rundown.

449
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,750
Okay, so it's 5v5.

450
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,190
So, like, there's only one L and one Kira.

451
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,250
So you either win by completing tasks as L or Kira or you kill L or you capture Kira.

452
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,470
And as Kira, Kira and Kira followers, you can talk to each other with a transmitter.

453
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,270
So, like, we can, like, secretly talk to each other.

454
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,390
So we're all investigators trying to find out who is Kira and who is Kira followers.

455
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:40,510
And if you're Kira, if you think you're getting sussed out, you can give your notebooks to other Kira followers so they become Kira.

456
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:53,210
So, um, and then when you're calling people out as a suspect during the meeting room phase, the L has to give the items to, like, another investigator.

457
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,290
But that investigator could be a Kira follower.

458
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:04,890
So if you give the suspect items to a Kira follower accidentally, then the suspect is not arrested.

459
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,870
I see.

460
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,490
It's like, yeah, so it's like, yeah.

461
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,210
So...

462
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,450
And then Kira followers and Kiras can steal your IDs by standing next to them.

463
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,990
And I can steal your ID and then we write down your name and you die.

464
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,650
So, you know, if I suddenly stand next to somebody and you're like, what the fuck are you standing next to me for?

465
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,390
They might be trying to steal your ID.

466
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,250
And then, yeah, so this one...

467
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,290
Please!

468
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,810
I was trying to...

469
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,930
How did you guys get all these customized things?

470
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,890
I mean, we all wailed already.

471
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,950
You get a key and then be like, please wait a moment.

472
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,890
Oh my god.

473
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,490
I will be the god of this new world.

474
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:04,730
I would say that there is, like, when the Kira people go near you or anyone goes near you, it'll warn you saying your ID was stolen, but it doesn't mean they did steal it.

475
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:09,030
You're just supposed to put in your journal that that person was close enough to you to potentially steal it.

476
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,850
Yeah, so they don't actually steal it, but...

477
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,830
I think it would have been really funny if you hadn't clarified that and then people start screaming at each other.

478
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,530
That's what I was worried about, honestly.

479
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,950
So you gotta be like, I'll be the god of this new world.

480
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,490
I'll be the god of...

481
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,010
Wait, how do you have the subtitles?

482
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,610
Oh, you go to T.

483
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,930
Justice plan.

484
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,970
You're supposed to be the furthest through the menu you go.

485
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,830
The first menu is relatively useful stuff, and then it's player callouts, and then it's like, I will be the god of this new world.

486
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,290
It's so funny.

487
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,330
I don't understand what's going on.

488
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,090
God.

489
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,290
Dead.

490
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,050
Wait, are we missing someone?

491
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,470
Yeah, we're missing Giga.

492
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,210
Oh, okay.

493
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,030
I was gonna say.

494
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:08,030
She said she was going to pee, so maybe she fell in.

495
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,550
I don't think she's okay in the bathroom.

496
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,110
Is there like a Giga update?

497
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:18,090
Is she like, is she been gone on her stream for too long?

498
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,210
I am becoming a player.

499
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:29,040
I like how you can just tell people to leave.

500
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,800
Like, actually, please leave.

501
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,120
Please become a player.

502
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,300
That's worse than asking if you're AFK.

503
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,400
Just like...

504
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,700
Oh my god.

505
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,580
Let me adjust my volume just a little bit.

506
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,080
Let's see.

507
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,140
I am going to refill my water while we wait for Giga.

508
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,220
Yeah, we're...

509
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,440
Oh, she's still AFK.

510
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,860
Apparently, people are saying that she's still AFK on Steam.

511
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,540
I don't think she's okay in the bathroom right now.

512
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,320
There's a battle going on in there.

513
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,520
She mainly ran out of toilet paper.

514
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,240
Oh no, somebody help her.

515
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,580
She has nobody.

516
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,660
She's clawing at the door.

517
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,920
Wait, wait, a message.

518
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,800
A DM.

519
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,740
A message.

520
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,840
She's clawing at the door.

521
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,780
She's on pause.

522
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,460
She's in contact.

523
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,420
We're just here shitposting.

524
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,680
Oh my god.

525
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,260
That's a real battle.

526
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,640
You can't beat the game.

527
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,980
God.

528
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,380
God.

529
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,360
Just God.

530
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:46,960
God.

531
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,840
God.

532
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,600
Only one word.

533
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,960
God.

534
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,840
I need you guys to make sure that all of your audios is good because I'm cooking something.

535
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:58,840
Okay.

536
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Okay.

537
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,080
Okay.

538
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,420
I don't know how it'll go, but I think it's great.

539
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,280
Alright, are we all ready?

540
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,480
Giga's here.

541
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,960
Giga, can you say something so we can hear you?

542
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
Can you hear me?

543
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,380
Yeah, yeah, we can hear you.

544
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,980
Giga, were you okay in the bathroom?

545
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,700
Oh yeah, I sat in there for three years.

546
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,940
Alright, are you guys all ready?

547
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,280
Yeah.

548
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm starting the game now.

549
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,800
We can still talk in the loading screen.

550
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,480
Oh, we can say what role we want.

551
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:37,760
I like that.

552
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,460
I'm not gonna be Kira.

553
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,800
I'm not Kira.

554
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm not Kira.

555
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,100
I'm not Kira.

556
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm not Kira.

557
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,180
I'm not Kira.

558
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,760
Neither am I.

559
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,640
Who could it be?

560
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,780
I'm not Kira.

561
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,780
It must be randomized, that's interesting.

562
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,140
Oh my god, who's gonna be Kira?

563
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,820
Oh my god, Kira followers can't be arrested if they don't have a...

564
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,880
Oh my god.

565
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,260
Ah, man.

566
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,720
Oh, okay.

567
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,560
Whoa, wind conditions.

568
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,720
Can't tell how much they can hear me right now.

569
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,360
Hello?

570
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,700
Who's next?

571
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,640
Oh, hi!

572
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,020
Hi.

573
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,640
Is there push to talk?

574
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,800
Oh gosh, yeah, it's V.

575
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
Oh, did you steal my ID?

576
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,000
Hey, wait, how do I do this?

577
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,100
Oh, I have to go monitor somebody.

578
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,620
Excuse me, see ya.

579
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,420
I'm monitoring.

580
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:46,920
Oh.

581
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,200
Don't trust investigators who try to get close to you or have a notebook open.

582
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,720
Oh, okay.

583
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,460
I look so stupid walking around town.

584
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,420
Oh, hi!

585
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,840
Oh, hello.

586
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,580
Hello, what are you guys doing?

587
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,920
Oh, someone's approaching.

588
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,440
Where are you guys going?

589
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm running you guys down in my notebook.

590
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,060
Bella's not talking to me and she's scaring me.

591
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,740
Oh, don't, get away from me, get away from me.

592
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,200
Alima, you're muted.

593
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:13,760
Okay.

594
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,260
You okay?

595
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,680
Oh no, I'm muted?

596
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:16,900
Oh, there you go.

597
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,520
No, you're not muted.

598
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Oh, nevermind, okay.

599
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,700
Oh, stay away from me.

600
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,060
Bella's not responding to me, it's creeping me out.

601
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,160
Oh gosh, wait, don't take my ID.

602
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,360
What am I supposed to do here?

603
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,080
Leave a note, but I don't know what note am I leaving.

604
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,100
Hello?

605
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,440
I hear you guys.

606
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,000
What am I doing?

607
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
Dude, who keeps stealing my ID?

608
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
I don't have that many.

609
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,580
Oh.

610
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,960
Alright, Giga, you're up.

611
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,200
Okay, what's up?

612
00:29:59,540 --> 00:29:59,740
Give.

613
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,680
What's happening?

614
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,340
What happened?

615
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,240
What's going on?

616
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,340
Progress report?

617
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,720
Progress report?

618
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,260
Oh god.

619
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,180
Oh my god.

620
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,040
What happened today?

621
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,540
I failed everything?

622
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,660
Oh my god, that was something.

623
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,760
I should've...

624
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,840
I should've done a lot.

625
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,520
I need to frame what happened.

626
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,720
Okay, okay, nice.

627
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,100
Investigator.

628
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160
Investigation versus gold.

629
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,960
Uh oh.

630
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,520
Okay, so...

631
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:23,940
Someone died?

632
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,860
Criminals dead.

633
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,720
Yeah, criminals.

634
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:26,700
Uh oh.

635
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,640
We're even.

636
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,680
Oh my god, we're even, yeah.

637
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,200
That's fine.

638
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,720
Where is everybody?

639
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Speak up if you're...

640
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,980
How do I know if my ID was taken?

641
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,440
I forgot it at home.

642
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
My ID was taken.

643
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,480
My ID...

644
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,520
I think I dropped it.

645
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,580
In the bathroom.

646
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,400
In the toilet.

647
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,700
That's entirely my vibes.

648
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
Be insanely rancid.

649
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
Wait, is it supposed to be in my inventory?

650
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,600
I think mint.

651
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,820
Mint!

652
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,200
Because as soon as I passed you, I got a notification that someone yoinked my ID.

653
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,720
No, that's just the automatic thing, I think.

654
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,700
It says your ID may have been stolen.

655
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,620
Okay, because Lyne said that, I'm gonna vote for her too.

656
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,440
I have to follow it.

657
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,780
The real Kira knew I would say that, and so they made an arbitrary rule.

658
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,240
I have a question.

659
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,980
How the fuck am I supposed to investigate other players?

660
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,400
Because I failed my investigation of another player.

661
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,860
Can you, like, retract your, like...

662
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,740
What happens if you shamelessly point fingers?

663
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,500
Well, they get arrested.

664
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
So, like, they basically...

665
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,920
Oh, they get tied to you.

666
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,720
So we should...

667
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,980
If you want to, like, set somebody up, they get, like, handcuffed to the person that got set up.

668
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,500
I don't want that.

669
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,640
I have a question.

670
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,320
Wait, I have a question.

671
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,400
Who is Kira?

672
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,580
Just...

673
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,900
Great question.

674
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,760
The real Kira would be handcuffed right now.

675
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,480
I want to say I think Mint and Amelie are both suspicious.

676
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm suspicious?

677
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,780
I'm just an investigator.

678
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,660
Nobody will be suspicious yet.

679
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,940
Nobody has any fucking clue what we're doing.

680
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,940
The thing is, obviously, to stand next to somebody playing innocent to the most obvious tool tips.

681
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,980
Because I saw Bao voted for you, and Bao seems to know what she's doing.

682
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
They're not Kira.

683
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,020
I sure do.

684
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,100
That's what Kira would say.

685
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,760
Wait, you can skip...

686
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,180
I'm gonna vote for that outfit, not gonna lie.

687
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,740
Look at that.

688
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,600
Look at that wig.

689
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,840
Yeah, Mint.

690
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,800
You're hating on me because I'm styling?

691
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
That's so messed up.

692
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,320
Mint is, like, impersonating us.

693
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,900
Doing trick shots on us.

694
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,920
Oh, wait, lots of people are voting for me.

695
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,920
This is kind of crazy.

696
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,500
Am I gonna die?

697
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,900
Who are you voting for?

698
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,620
No, you just get handcuffed.

699
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,140
Nobody.

700
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,520
And every day we don't vote is another death on our hands.

701
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,160
Shut up!

702
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
I can't take it anymore.

703
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,580
No one was arrested.

704
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,700
Why are we in class?

705
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,540
What is this?

706
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,580
Okay, question that NPCs.

707
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,500
Where's the NPCs?

708
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,600
Hey, stay away from me.

709
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,840
Why do you have three of those in your mouth?

710
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,420
Hey, stay away from me!

711
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,360
You're trying to steal!

712
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,360
Oh my god, Giga's trying to steal my wallet!

713
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,540
Giga's a thief!

714
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,960
Giga's trying to steal my wallet!

715
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,720
I'm gonna steal everyone's wallets!

716
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,020
Oh my god.

717
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, is this a guy?

718
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,100
How do I do this?

719
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,780
Did your wallet get stolen?

720
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,140
No, I think I'm okay.

721
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,700
How do I do the NPCs?

722
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:52,140
I think I did it.

723
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh, I got it.

724
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,260
Okay, nice.

725
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh, there's a lot of NPCs.

726
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,100
Oh my god.

727
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,700
What's happening?

728
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,060
What is happening?

729
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,540
What's going on, dude?

730
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,400
That was fast.

731
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,740
How did that happen?

732
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,200
Who was curious?

733
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,040
Oh my god!

734
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,080
We were supposed to protect L!

735
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,580
How did you know?

736
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,740
It's over, dude.

737
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,180
How did you know?

738
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,120
It's over.

739
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,180
Wait, Vienna, how did you do it?

740
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,320
How did they know?

741
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,320
They're too good.

742
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,040
They're too good.

743
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,720
Vienna, how did you know, Vienna?

744
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,140
Vienna is muted.

745
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,620
We have a mastermind in here.

746
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,360
She's so good, she won't even share her secret.

747
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,580
She won't even tell us.

748
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,160
She's like, I don't reveal secrets.

749
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,560
Vienna did the tutorial.

750
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,330
The skill discrepancy, I need a handicap.

751
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,650
We were muted, oh no!

752
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,170
We're getting DMs from her.

753
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,390
I just hear, I hear like some...

754
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,970
Wait, Vienna, change your, change your audio source.

755
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,270
That might be the wrong one.

756
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,310
Select it in the settings.

757
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,830
Okay, yeah.

758
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,310
She's trying to communicate.

759
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,430
There's a mosquito in the lobby.

760
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,290
She's communicating from the beyond.

761
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,270
She can sense L's electrical signal using her electrical telepathic ability.

762
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,250
That's incredible.

763
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,230
Magnetism waves coming from L's transmission.

764
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,830
If you're in the room with us, please make your presence known.

765
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,850
I have his laptop right here.

766
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,170
If you want to talk to L, come here.

767
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,090
I am L, stop impersonating me.

768
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,550
It's so confusing that there's like, Limu is just L, so I'm like, wait, is Limu L or is Limu evil?

769
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,450
When it came up and was like, L has been killed, I was like, oh no, not me.

770
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,550
Oh no, it's not me.

771
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,930
Hold it.

772
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,630
Oh, hold it, hold it and talk.

773
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,170
Oh, that works.

774
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:27,050
She was talking earlier.

775
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,850
It's Morse code.

776
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,090
Morse code.

777
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,030
I just want to know how she did it.

778
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,370
How did she do it?

779
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,590
I want to know her secrets.

780
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,690
Vianna is going to have superpowers because Vianna was actually playing the tutorials and stuff before we started.

781
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,750
And is like one of the only people that did that.

782
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,170
She went non-verbal to ingest all the information.

783
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,710
I played the tutorials.

784
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,810
I should have done that.

785
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,150
Oh no, that's her gopher.

786
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,790
I sabotaged her so she couldn't explain anything.

787
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,370
She was like, I'm going to play the game.

788
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,030
The real Death Note.

789
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,570
How the fuck do you monitor other players?

790
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,370
I go to cutthroats and go to cut-ins and you see last words.

791
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,610
I got one that was like, I'll post your name on the internet.

792
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,230
I think if you're arrested, that's what you say.

793
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,250
Oh my god.

794
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,170
I love that.

795
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,730
That's dramatic.

796
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,190
I'm going to post your information.

797
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,010
I'll post your name on the internet.

798
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,270
Can I be your girlfriend?

799
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,310
I would.

800
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,030
Want to go for a drink after this?

801
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,170
Why am I rising up?

802
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,850
There's one last word that's like, kill me.

803
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,370
Just kill me.

804
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,250
There's one for El that says, am I a freak?

805
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,450
Am I a freak?

806
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,190
I see me in the mirror every morning.

807
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,610
Am I a freak?

808
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:01,730
Am I a freak?

809
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,750
Oh my gosh, these nameplates are so...

810
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,230
Are your guys' sounds in English or Japanese?

811
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,390
Does it change if you have the English audio?

812
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,170
It's in Japanese only, I think.

813
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,550
Oh yeah, we found out that this game is not available in Japan.

814
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,330
Yeah.

815
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,070
Really?

816
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,190
Is it in Japanese?

817
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,350
Yeah.

818
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:31,170
I asked Kenya if she wanted to join and she was like, the game's not available for me.

819
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,790
Oh my god, that was bad.

820
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,450
You know how many games I've tried to play with her and she's like, I can't play it because I'm in Japan.

821
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,890
That's so sad.

822
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,290
Why is it reason exclusive when it's literally Death Note?

823
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,790
I don't know.

824
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,550
In Japanese too, like the Japanese audio.

825
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,330
Death in Japan debuff.

826
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,790
Oh my god, I guess they don't want to play Among Us.

827
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,750
It's for us weebs, I guess.

828
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,350
Yeah, yeah, only it's Nostalgia Bay for us.

829
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,090
Oh yeah.

830
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,290
I always wanted to be Kira.

831
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,830
Vienna's restarting the game.

832
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,290
I like how she tried to tell us a couple of times and it was just...

833
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:18,110
I think I'm starting to understand.

834
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,130
You guys won with her being completely silent, which is crazy.

835
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,590
Yeah, can't Kira like coordinate between all of you guys and like talk to you and like secretly...

836
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,070
Yeah, that's what we were doing.

837
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,530
We weren't that much earlier.

838
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,670
We were like talking to each other.

839
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,590
That's so cool.

840
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:37,590
That's me.

841
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,610
I was L and I was like...

842
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,830
I am Kira from the great beyond.

843
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,750
Wait, do you actually talk over like a loudspeaker?

844
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,830
Like everyone hears you?

845
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,830
No, only the good team or the bad team hears you.

846
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,930
So Kira can only talk to the killer people, the Kira-aligned people, and L can talk to the investigators.

847
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:59,230
I was L and I knew how to look through the camera so I was able to like see those.

848
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,830
But I don't know how to talk to everyone.

849
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,310
I don't know how to do it.

850
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,330
No, I think two wasn't...

851
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,350
I mean, we literally got...

852
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:07,890
Can you hear me now?

853
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,390
Can you hear me now?

854
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,610
We're either Kira or L.

855
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,110
Oh my god.

856
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:12,990
Yay!

857
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:14,750
Welcome.

858
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:21,150
I stole Giga's ID and then wrote her name in the book and she was L, so we won.

859
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,070
Masterful game.

860
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,110
Easy.

861
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,670
This is so easy.

862
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,830
People are just gonna spend the entire time sprinting away from each other.

863
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,950
I find it funny that like anybody who like... it's like COVID.

864
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,650
Anybody who gets like so much close to me, I'm just like, you're fucking dead.

865
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,230
It's chill if I write her name down, right?

866
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,250
It's chill.

867
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,710
So it was just a lucky guess?

868
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,650
Yeah, it was just lucky.

869
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,470
Yeah, based on what you said.

870
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,030
So like there's tasks where like investigators have to be next to a person.

871
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,290
So an investigator could be next to a person just investigating them.

872
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,990
So it throws you off.

873
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,050
Are you guys ready?

874
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:03,710
Yeah.

875
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,430
Let's do it again.

876
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,990
No idea what I'm doing.

877
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,730
Wait, was that Fiona?

878
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,450
Fiona?

879
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,410
What?

880
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,030
Am I good?

881
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,450
Oh, okay.

882
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:11,910
Yeah, you're good.

883
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,210
You're good.

884
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:17,890
I wanna be a hot girl.

885
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,070
I'm not Kira this time.

886
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,630
I wanna be a hot girl.

887
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,790
Wanna be Misa?

888
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,630
Yeah, I wanna be a goddess girl.

889
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,170
Being Kira is like stressful, Loki.

890
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,450
First thing I did was give the book to Loki.

891
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,270
Here we go.

892
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,930
Am I gonna be a hot girl?

893
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,050
Oh my gosh.

894
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,990
Oh, come on.

895
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,210
I just wanna be a hot girl.

896
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,850
Okay, it's hard to get the investigation progress, I feel.

897
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,150
I'm here.

898
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,590
I'm ready.

899
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,070
I'm a hot investigator.

900
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,270
Oh, hi, Doki.

901
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,310
Oh, hey.

902
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,050
Hi.

903
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,170
Are you... What are you?

904
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,870
I'm a hot investigator too.

905
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:03,710
I doubt that.

906
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,670
Oh yeah, I'm gonna write your name.

907
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,150
Get away from me.

908
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,450
Get away from me.

909
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:11,650
No.

910
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,130
Wait, what's happening?

911
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,510
What's happening?

912
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,510
Death note test.

913
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,330
Death note test?

914
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,010
Oh no.

915
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:17,990
Oh my God, wait.

916
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,390
What?

917
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:20,930
What the?

918
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:21,990
What am I doing over here?

919
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,470
A body was found?

920
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,710
Hey, are you the death note...

921
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,410
Oh my God.

922
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,250
Hello?

923
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,830
In here?

924
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:34,630
In here?

925
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,190
Oh, what is happening?

926
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,310
Dude, everyone... A bunch of people dead.

927
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,670
Oh shit.

928
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,690
This is... This looks dangerous.

929
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,610
We have 16 seconds left.

930
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,050
Oh gosh, we're not gonna make it.

931
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,390
We're not gonna make it.

932
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:50,970
What's happening?

933
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,410
People are dead everywhere.

934
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,430
In here?

935
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,450
How do I go over here?

936
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,290
I think here.

937
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,490
Oh my God.

938
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:04,850
Hello.

939
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,250
I took a note.

940
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,850
You're supposed to resolve those in time.

941
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,410
That was like really fast.

942
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,950
I know.

943
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,350
We had no time at all.

944
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,910
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,550
That's what I said.

946
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,890
OK.

947
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,370
Back to our normal schedule.

948
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,650
Ignore the dead people.

949
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,330
Who cares?

950
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:21,870
Yeah, ignore the dead people.

951
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,630
I don't need to talk to this bozo.

952
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,690
I need to talk to this bozo.

953
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,250
Oh my gosh, they were in here the whole time.

954
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,730
Oh, who the hell was that?

955
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,210
Hello?

956
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:34,550
Limel?

957
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,490
What did you just do?

958
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,650
I gave you a thing.

959
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,250
I don't know why.

960
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Oh, you gave me a lost item.

961
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,050
OK.

962
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:43,830
Thank you.

963
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,390
Mint.

964
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,590
I have a lost item for you.

965
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,450
People keep giving me lost items.

966
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:51,110
Lost item?

967
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,530
I don't know what it means.

968
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,050
I don't have any items on me.

969
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,790
So I don't actually know how to do this.

970
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,470
Where's Limel?

971
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,370
I don't know how this game works.

972
00:43:59,370 --> 00:43:59,650
OK.

973
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:00,770
Thanks.

974
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:01,470
I think.

975
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,270
What's going on?

976
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,770
WD.

977
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:07,750
Nice.

978
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,810
Supposedly someone was talking on a transceiver during the night.

979
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:14,570
Oh wait, we only have 7 seconds left in the day.

980
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:15,430
Oh no!

981
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:17,630
Snuffy!

982
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,270
Snuffy!

983
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,250
Snuffy, what were you doing?

984
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,630
I was reading my notebook.

985
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:33,030
Is it possibly a black notebook?

986
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,150
It was my investigation notebook.

987
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,310
Why did you walk so close to me?

988
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,810
I have some hot news.

989
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:50,230
We were resolving the thing and Mint talked to us but didn't help resolve the thing.

990
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,730
I didn't know how to.

991
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,990
You know what?

992
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,770
That's a very lucky story.

993
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,870
Doki, you literally just said you saw Snuffy with the book.

994
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,090
Why are we ignoring you?

995
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,250
There's a Kira follower.

996
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,370
Wait, my ID was stolen.

997
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,930
My ID was stolen too.

998
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,030
Yeah, everyone stole my ID.

999
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,210
Everybody approached me.

1000
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:16,990
This sucks.

1001
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:23,350
I think it's Snuffy because I saw her bring out the notebook in the corner as if she was hiding something.

1002
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,890
Everybody has a notebook.

1003
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,610
Was it the investigation notebook ad?

1004
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,630
No, I saw it was a black notebook.

1005
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:40,670
My ID got stolen and Jupi and Giga were close to me at suspicious moments.

1006
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,630
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you, Kira?

1007
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:53,290
I was running past Vienna and then as soon as Vienna saw me run past her, she immediately turned and was following after me and was like, I'm supposed to investigate you, but I don't know.

1008
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,810
No, but Vienna was definitely resolving the dead person with me, so...

1009
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,250
Okay, fair.

1010
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,810
I was resolving the last body by myself because Mint walked away.

1011
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,230
No, I came up and it finished.

1012
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,090
We ran out of time.

1013
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,210
Why are you suspecting me?

1014
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,310
You literally saw Snuffy.

1015
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,930
There's still a follower out there.

1016
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,450
We gotta get all of them and I remember before she was like, I wanna be just like Misa.

1017
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,350
My ID was stolen.

1018
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,210
My social security is on the line right now.

1019
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,710
Wait, we're just dead if we don't get the person.

1020
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,750
I think there's more to worry about than your social security if it got stolen.

1021
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,890
I'm gonna vote for Limu because you had a little magnifying glass after you walked by me, you were looking at my ID.

1022
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,610
I returned your lost property.

1023
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,590
It said Mint has lost an item and I was like, oh, that sucks.

1024
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:42,890
I lost nothing!

1025
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,770
So I went and got it and I gave it to you.

1026
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,850
Your notebook?

1027
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,090
Oh, I lost my ID, that's right.

1028
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,770
Is it in your bag now?

1029
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,890
Because I gave you an item and I got experience for doing it.

1030
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,230
No, I have no items.

1031
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:02,690
I also had a prompt to deliver Mint a lost item, but I don't know how.

1032
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,970
Everybody has my ID apparently.

1033
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,630
How did so many people return it just to lose it again?

1034
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,850
Are we voting Snuffy then?

1035
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,650
I voted for Snuffy.

1036
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,530
Change to Snuffy who hasn't voted.

1037
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,830
That's so sad.

1038
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,710
What if like the investigation notepad is just like everyone's is the same like color?

1039
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:27,650
Now what?

1040
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,650
Oh wait, who was gonna confiscate the item?

1041
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:36,970
You can trust me.

1042
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,850
No, don't give it to Doki.

1043
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,090
What do you mean?

1044
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,350
I'm the one that called her out.

1045
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,170
Who is this?

1046
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,770
Is it Snuffy?

1047
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,150
One giant handcuff.

1048
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,930
Why are they zooming in on the face?

1049
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,590
They are publishing the name.

1050
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,650
Live reactions.

1051
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,250
Oh yeah.

1052
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,050
We won!

1053
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,530
We did it!

1054
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:32,030
I'll add more Akira followers.

1055
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:32,850
Really?

1056
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,670
You can do that?

1057
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,930
Yeah, I can increase it.

1058
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,390
Oh, I got a last word.

1059
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,970
My apologies, Snuffy.

1060
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,230
I wasn't good enough.

1061
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,230
It was the first time trying to figure it out.

1062
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,950
I didn't know it would just be so obvious.

1063
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,130
I tried to hide in the corner and like away from the camera.

1064
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,290
It's just like it's so obvious if you're looking at it.

1065
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,870
You have to do like the same like button thing.

1066
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,930
I thought maybe I would just have to click on something, but you have to do like a button combo thingy.

1067
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:09,910
So just like if you want to go kill somebody, make sure you're like ready to do like a quick button press.

1068
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:12,690
QTE that shit.

1069
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,410
I feel like the map isn't big enough.

1070
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,010
Like we are always bumping into each other.

1071
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,790
I think there is a different map.

1072
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,550
I don't know if there's a different map now.

1073
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,890
I'm checking the settings right now.

1074
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,550
Wait, what happened at the first part with the body thing?

1075
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:25,430
What even was that?

1076
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,550
I didn't make it to any of those.

1077
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,030
I don't know.

1078
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:27,650
What the fuck was happening?

1079
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:34,010
It was like a bunch of crimes, but the amount of time we had to resolve the crimes was fucking minuscule.

1080
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,370
So it was like impossible to do.

1081
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,970
Can they do that?

1082
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,390
Because I don't remember that from the tutorial.

1083
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,890
Every player has black notebooks.

1084
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,470
Oh, that's good.

1085
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:43,710
Yeah.

1086
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,550
All players have black notebooks.

1087
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:51,130
We totally know how to play this game, so that will just make it really easy to learn.

1088
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,090
I mean, it's okay.

1089
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,110
We're still figuring it out.

1090
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,470
I'm sure after like a round or two, we'll get the hang of it.

1091
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,070
Yeah, yeah.

1092
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:57,370
Okay.

1093
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,250
Let's see...

1094
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,470
It's 1-1 right now for bad and good guys.

1095
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:05,430
I'm gonna turn down the meeting hours, so less discussion.

1096
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,170
Okay.

1097
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,030
Uh-huh.

1098
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:11,470
Question, does the notebooks look different than the Death Note?

1099
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,710
If they do, they won't.

1100
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,510
Not anymore.

1101
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,350
Not anymore, I made it so they're all black.

1102
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,450
Yeah, they're all gonna be the same.

1103
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,770
Yeah, so we take our notebooks out, it's gonna be like black, so we don't know if it's an actual Death Note or not.

1104
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,370
Okay, okay.

1105
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,370
I'm gonna check if there's other settings.

1106
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:31,070
Is there a way to increase the time for the sabotage, whatever happens?

1107
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,630
The sabotage?

1108
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,090
A round increase would be good.

1109
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,250
A round increase time would be nice.

1110
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,110
Yeah, that too.

1111
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,590
Okay, increasing the round.

1112
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:39,670
Uh...

1113
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,270
Day-night?

1114
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,390
I think that's it.

1115
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,810
I'll do 90 seconds.

1116
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,230
Okay, let's try it.

1117
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:48,050
90 seconds and then... I'm checking if there's anything else.

1118
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:53,090
Uh... I think we can do that for now and then we'll adjust the settings later.

1119
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,910
Uh-huh.

1120
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:00,110
Alright, starting now.

1121
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,870
Let's go.

1122
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:03,870
Sexy.

1123
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,490
Oh, I could... Oh, I can turn off role selection next game.

1124
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:08,670
Oh, wait.

1125
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,230
I don't think it matters though, because every time I've pressed Kira follower, nothing happens.

1126
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,630
Oh, wait.

1127
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,710
This is what you want, but it won't always give it to you, I guess?

1128
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,550
Oh, I never pressed confirm.

1129
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,110
Oh my god.

1130
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,220
Oh, come on.

1131
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,260
It still didn't work.

1132
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,080
This sucks.

1133
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,480
Oh, come on.

1134
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,220
It's because I'm dressed up as L.

1135
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,840
The desire meter.

1136
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,040
What's the hint?

1137
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,820
I'm running around.

1138
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,500
I'm a little investigator doing investigating things.

1139
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,500
Limu is very sussy right now, just following me.

1140
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,540
Let's do this guy.

1141
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,880
Oh, hello.

1142
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,980
What's my task?

1143
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,100
Oh, okay.

1144
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,360
I'm avoiding.

1145
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,360
This guy is suss... Oh, never mind.

1146
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Hello, Limu.

1147
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,600
Excuse me.

1148
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,860
Fancy seeing you here.

1149
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,240
One person came by today.

1150
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,760
It was Limu.

1151
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,000
That was me.

1152
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,980
Oh, I completed my tasks.

1153
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:35,360
Okay.

1154
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,060
I'm gonna explore now.

1155
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,640
Oh, look at the giant cake.

1156
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,340
Wow.

1157
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,740
Pop a coin.

1158
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,680
Thanks for six months.

1159
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,440
Thank you.

1160
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,380
This is death note among us.

1161
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,120
Yeah, actually.

1162
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,180
What?

1163
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,760
How did you get that?

1164
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,480
What the...

1165
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,120
I don't hear her anymore.

1166
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,980
Anybody in here?

1167
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,860
Okay, let's go looking.

1168
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:10,720
L.

1169
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,580
Vindicating evidence.

1170
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,780
Investigating my contact.

1171
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,220
What is this?

1172
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,960
Oh, what is this?

1173
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,640
Limu's role is investigator.

1174
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,220
Oh, there's more... Okay, there's more tasks at night.

1175
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,760
Oh, that's kind of fun though.

1176
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,380
Okay, so...

1177
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,780
Is Kira gonna kill me too?

1178
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,560
So it makes it so when you finish your day tasks...

1179
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,220
There we go.

1180
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,400
Two people.

1181
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,520
Oh, finish all your canvas tasks for the day.

1182
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,600
I gotta go monitor the parking lot.

1183
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,460
So Limu is safe.

1184
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,100
I figured.

1185
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,680
Oh my gosh.

1186
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,940
I'm scared of you guys.

1187
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,680
What's going on in here?

1188
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,440
What are you doing here?

1189
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,660
It's funny finding you here in the garage.

1190
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,100
Yeah, funny finding you here, little lady.

1191
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,540
Now, why would you walk in if you knew that I walked in here, but there's nothing in here?

1192
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,060
I walked in here not knowing you walked in here.

1193
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,340
But I just saw you outside, so you walked in behind me.

1194
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,140
I saw no one walk through here.

1195
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,100
I was running away from others.

1196
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,180
Hmm.

1197
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,480
Wow, suspicious.

1198
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,900
Why are you in here when there's no car here?

1199
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,540
You have no car, no business.

1200
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,820
Because I don't know this map.

1201
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,760
Quite suspicious.

1202
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,260
I'll be posting this on the internet.

1203
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,140
You ain't gotta do all that.

1204
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,840
Oh my god!

1205
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,820
Oh my god!

1206
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,380
What the hell?

1207
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,700
Did this happen the first time?

1208
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,780
Oh my god!

1209
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,420
No!

1210
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,200
Oh my god.

1211
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,780
She's the only one who knew.

1212
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,220
Okay, who specified that she had such a horrible death?

1213
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,180
You could've just been like...

1214
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,980
She's gonna post her names on the internet.

1215
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:37,780
I was like using Lime for standing too close to me, and then the next second a car hit her.

1216
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:41,620
We literally saw that she's an investigator.

1217
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,460
We literally had her confirmed.

1218
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,180
Maybe you were her in the notebook.

1219
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,180
I believe she got isekai'd.

1220
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,160
A dying message.

1221
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,020
My ID was stolen.

1222
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,000
I don't know who it was.

1223
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,400
That'll do it, bro.

1224
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:08,580
Wait a minute, my thing says, Amelie seems to have been in close contact with many people, so they might be L.

1225
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,180
Be sure to tell them.

1226
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,700
Okay, me and Bao were next to Lime when she got hit by the car.

1227
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,600
Did that literally happen?

1228
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,960
My passport was...

1229
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,800
Who was next to me?

1230
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,360
Somebody stood next to me and I was like, that'd be funny if they took my ID.

1231
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,200
And they did!

1232
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:29,840
Who was it?

1233
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,040
That's your fault, you need to pay attention.

1234
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,020
Wait, I don't have an ID either.

1235
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,140
Wait, I think it was Vienna.

1236
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,080
I saw someone right in a notebook right before that happened on the left side of the map.

1237
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,060
I was watching Joopi.

1238
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:47,320
My notebook out.

1239
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,460
That was like a heart attack, because everybody pulls out the death.

1240
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,860
That's really scary.

1241
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,000
That's very specific.

1242
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,300
I think Juniper would do something that specific.

1243
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,740
I wouldn't do something... I never do specific things.

1244
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,320
I like to do...

1245
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,740
Okay, buddy.

1246
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,400
I don't know.

1247
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,160
I'm scared.

1248
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,220
Oh my god, somebody actually died and now we're not like, accusing somebody right away.

1249
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,600
I'm really... I don't care.

1250
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,420
I don't need to accuse somebody.

1251
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,740
No one was arrested.

1252
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,900
Oh, Lima.

1253
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,700
She was right here with me.

1254
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,460
How do I... What does it look like?

1255
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,980
Oh, now I have my notebook open.

1256
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,240
Okay.

1257
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,480
So I'm like, making investigations.

1258
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,980
No one's been here by...

1259
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,660
So, I kind of get it.

1260
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,140
So if someone looks like they're...

1261
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,660
Investigating a person...

1262
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,020
But then the person says no one's been here, then you can kind of tell.

1263
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,780
I get it.

1264
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,920
I get... You can...

1265
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,100
Oh, set up surveillance.

1266
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:49,460
Okay.

1267
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,200
Okay.

1268
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,780
Oh, what do I do?

1269
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,780
I got a thing.

1270
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,580
Okay, I'm about to install it.

1271
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,040
In here.

1272
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,080
I'm doing it.

1273
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,120
I installed it.

1274
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,020
I did my part.

1275
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,420
I'm starting to understand.

1276
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,500
Because I'm like, how are you supposed to tell...

1277
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,260
When someone has been...

1278
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,420
Like, you know, if someone's not doing their tasks.

1279
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,120
Oh, hi.

1280
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:15,540
Hello.

1281
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,600
Interesting.

1282
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,860
Oh my gosh!

1283
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,900
Did you steal my ID?

1284
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,280
I didn't take your ID.

1285
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,260
I need to observe you.

1286
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,580
Wait, you need to observe me?

1287
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,660
Are you taking my ID?

1288
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,520
Oh my gosh!

1289
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,320
I'm about to die.

1290
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,060
Oh no!

1291
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,640
I'm about to die.

1292
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,280
Oh gosh.

1293
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,440
What am I doing?

1294
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,060
I'm resolving the incident.

1295
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,420
One person resolving.

1296
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,720
Hey, why... Okay, two people.

1297
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,080
Yeah, it's us.

1298
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,540
What the hell is this?

1299
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,460
Yeah.

1300
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,560
A mime has died.

1301
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,200
Probably.

1302
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,060
Okay, so we got that one.

1303
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,160
Nice.

1304
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,100
Wait, there was three people in here.

1305
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,260
Why did only two help?

1306
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,560
I see.

1307
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,040
Unlikely story.

1308
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,580
Yeah.

1309
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,240
Yeah.

1310
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,320
Oh.

1311
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,360
More NPCs.

1312
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,620
Okay.

1313
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,360
Oh, oh, oh.

1314
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,650
I'm gonna go see if this one...

1315
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,920
This one might say something about...

1316
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,020
Oh.

1317
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:43,800
Grimmy.

1318
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,620
Someone talking on a transceiver.

1319
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,640
Don't kill me.

1320
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,100
Don't kill me.

1321
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:56,560
Don't kill me.

1322
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:56,940
Don't kill me.

1323
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,640
Come here, Grimmy.

1324
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,720
Loyalty to the mission, Grimmy.

1325
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,260
Come here, Grimmy.

1326
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,520
No, no, no, no.

1327
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,560
Wait, where is this person?

1328
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:11,700
In here?

1329
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,320
I'm not good at these.

1330
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,060
At the cafe.

1331
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,480
These little notes are not very helpful.

1332
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:21,760
Hello.

1333
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,240
Oh, excuse me.

1334
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,700
Someone might have stolen my ID.

1335
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,400
Oh my god.

1336
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,370
I'm gonna hide here.

1337
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,150
And be on my book.

1338
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,710
I'm gonna make it look really sussy.

1339
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,030
Like I'm killing someone.

1340
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,790
I'm killing someone in my book.

1341
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,770
Amelie's sus?

1342
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:51,590
I don't think so.

1343
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:51,710
No.

1344
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:57,920
No!

1345
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,700
I got death-soded.

1346
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,460
No!

1347
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,640
Who?

1348
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,920
Who is that?

1349
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,780
Sorry, someone's a mosquito again.

1350
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,680
Oh, is it me?

1351
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,560
No.

1352
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,520
It only happens for like a second.

1353
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,200
I think it's fine.

1354
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,820
Oh my god.

1355
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,900
He's laughing at me!

1356
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,000
Get him, Kira!

1357
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:24,300
Snuffy.

1358
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,060
That first round was just a test of your abilities.

1359
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,600
I fucking knew it!

1360
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,380
I knew it!

1361
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,500
This is so funny!

1362
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,540
I mean you, Elle.

1363
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,160
I think we should vote Snuffy every time.

1364
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,900
I said Snuffy!

1365
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,540
I called her out!

1366
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,900
Snuffy couldn't hear you guys for what it was worth.

1367
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,740
Like she said she couldn't hear you.

1368
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:43,540
Oh really?

1369
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,540
I was really scared that that was like a feature if I was Kira.

1370
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,980
Because like I could only hear when Vienna talked to me over the communications.

1371
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,680
But everybody else was dead silent.

1372
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,640
I couldn't hear anybody.

1373
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,600
Weird.

1374
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,720
I don't think that's supposed to happen.

1375
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,080
No, that would make it really obvious.

1376
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,580
Because people would just walk around being like, can you hear me?

1377
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,140
I kept trying to go around being like, I can't hear anybody.

1378
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:06,800
I'm sorry.

1379
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,640
But I just was worried that was so obvious.

1380
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,920
Yeah, I was like trying to call you out and you wouldn't respond.

1381
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,820
Oh, Snuffy said her mic's not working and I realized...

1382
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,640
Wait, that would help me as talking to you.

1383
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:20,840
Alright, let's see.

1384
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,980
You guys could hear me though, right?

1385
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,740
I could hear you fine.

1386
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,880
Is that okay?

1387
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,860
We're YouTube camping now.

1388
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,200
I think it was alright.

1389
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,140
Let's see what other stuff I can adjust.

1390
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,920
I know we can like do a...

1391
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,460
What was it?

1392
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,400
You don't have to choose what you want it to be.

1393
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,640
Oh yeah, it's just...

1394
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,940
Yeah, make it random.

1395
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1396
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,040
Where is it though?

1397
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,740
I chose follower like investigator and it was just like you.

1398
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,700
Actually, I didn't...

1399
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,800
No, I picked follower and it made me Kira.

1400
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,560
And I was like, what?

1401
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,540
I didn't even pick this.

1402
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,140
Okay.

1403
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:01,800
No problem, I've done it before.

1404
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,420
I wonder if her computer died.

1405
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,400
Wait, who?

1406
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,160
Who's?

1407
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,260
Who's?

1408
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,100
Oh yeah, it said that she left the room.

1409
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,180
I feel bad.

1410
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:13,500
Oh wait.

1411
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,220
I accused her of being...

1412
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,140
Kira got her.

1413
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,940
She's gone.

1414
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,140
I have to apologize to her.

1415
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,100
She has to come back.

1416
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,100
Usually for like games like Among Us...

1417
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,740
Did you guys hear my epic music though?

1418
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,760
Yeah, it was good.

1419
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,480
Actually, for games like Among Us, you don't really accuse people like...

1420
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,300
When only one person has died.

1421
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,640
I have to get out of the maybe Among Us mindset, you know?

1422
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,800
Because, you know, the laws of probability...

1423
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,160
It's harder.

1424
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,800
I feel like Kira has an easier job than the investigators.

1425
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,060
Now I'll be a liable partner, you know?

1426
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,620
So you'll be like, dang, Snuffy could be L.

1427
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,940
Which means she's a big brain and super cool.

1428
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,020
Kira could just be lucky.

1429
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:57,760
Yeah, right.

1430
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,940
Because I said something only the Shinigami can tell you about Amelie.

1431
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:02,960
And nobody noticed.

1432
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,800
I thought literally it's our third game.

1433
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,760
I don't think we could...

1434
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,280
Yeah, I know.

1435
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,740
Yeah, I'm pretty sure nobody fucking knows.

1436
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,380
It's okay.

1437
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,440
We're all learning live as we go along.

1438
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,220
Be careful if you're the bad guy.

1439
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,520
That was okay.

1440
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,700
I hope Kira didn't...

1441
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,600
I can't... Okay, wait.

1442
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,040
Snuffy, so you killed Lime like that?

1443
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,480
Yeah.

1444
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:30,840
That's so funny.

1445
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,680
How does that feel?

1446
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,560
Because I had to investigate her, which meant that I was like cuddling up real close.

1447
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,690
Yeah, I think it's definitely...

1448
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,560
Kira, Miss, Limes...

1449
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,880
A lot of them.

1450
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,800
I definitely think it's really hard with... It's like... I don't know how to describe it.

1451
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,260
It's really hard with the notebooks or without them.

1452
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,060
Because then everybody's pulling out the death note.

1453
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,980
And I could probably just kill somebody in front of everybody.

1454
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,640
And nobody could ever like question that.

1455
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,420
So it kind of adds that like secret...

1456
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,360
I'm Kira, so I don't know.

1457
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,650
I kind of think that maybe...

1458
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,060
It's kind of hard that way too.

1459
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,240
So it's something you guys...

1460
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,320
I feel like Kira's...

1461
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,820
I think you should probably run away or have to hide to do the death noting thing.

1462
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,220
Yeah.

1463
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,180
Okay, I'm gonna...

1464
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,180
Okay, I turned the...

1465
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,260
I turned the notebooks back to...

1466
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,140
Like Kira.

1467
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:12,920
Only Kira's black notebook then.

1468
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:13,200
Yeah.

1469
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,740
Because right now it's kind of like...

1470
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,520
Like, Kira can just get lucky.

1471
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,600
It feels like a little unbalanced.

1472
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,300
Yeah, she just looks at everybody putting out the notebook.

1473
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,940
And she's like, I'm gonna write people's names right now in front of everybody.

1474
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,220
I was just running around being like, I can't hear anything.

1475
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,620
And Vianna would be like, hey, that person's really suspicious.

1476
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:31,360
I think they're...

1477
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,320
Apparently...

1478
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,380
I was just like...

1479
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,340
That would not be...

1480
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,460
Whispering in your ear would do nothing.

1481
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,080
I'm sorry.

1482
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,360
So I guess we'll...

1483
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,420
We'll start it off then.

1484
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:42,740
Okay.

1485
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,560
Yeah, yeah.

1486
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,340
That's so funny, Sophie.

1487
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,560
You did everything you did all the way.

1488
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,160
Oh, come on.

1489
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,100
I'm always investigating.

1490
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,340
Ah, okay.

1491
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,680
I'll be the best there can be.

1492
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,240
I'm a prime.

1493
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,580
I'm an investigator in my prime.

1494
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,780
I've just started.

1495
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,120
I'm just a little investigator.

1496
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,420
Hey, Snuffy.

1497
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:27,000
I'm green, but I'm full of hope and ambition and lots of really fun ideas.

1498
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,840
Oh, who am I?

1499
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,040
Oh, I'm supposed to be observing someone.

1500
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,200
Oh, my God.

1501
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,760
Who the hell is this?

1502
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,480
Oh, God.

1503
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,200
Sorry, my bad.

1504
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:49,760
I was...

1505
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,240
You're not the person I'm supposed to be.

1506
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,540
One person came by.

1507
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:53,920
Okay.

1508
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,620
Interesting.

1509
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,260
Interesting.

1510
01:06:59,260 --> 01:06:59,620
Interesting.

1511
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,790
No one's been here before me, eh?

1512
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,390
Okay, interesting.

1513
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:10,570
Interesting.

1514
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,070
Who am I following?

1515
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:15,010
Oh.

1516
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,590
Yeah, yeah.

1517
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,550
Why are you guys kissing?

1518
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,390
I have my eye on you and Groomy.

1519
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:21,530
This is my yaoi family.

1520
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,850
Doki Doki's trying to mind game me.

1521
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,030
I don't like it.

1522
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:25,650
I'm saying that, like, she...

1523
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,170
This is the only person I stood next to.

1524
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:30,390
So, like, if something happens, if my ID is gone, I'm just saying...

1525
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,670
Okay.

1526
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:35,490
Only person, eh?

1527
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:36,710
Only person, eh, Doki?

1528
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:45,370
I wrote your name down.

1529
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:49,250
Oh,

1530
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:53,610
I gotta go all the way.

1531
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,410
Okay, hold on.

1532
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:55,110
This person first.

1533
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,430
I'm chatting.

1534
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:57,510
I'm chatting.

1535
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,590
Five people?

1536
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:02,950
Hello?

1537
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,030
Six people.

1538
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,930
Are they sure about that?

1539
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:06,370
It was you.

1540
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:07,690
It was you.

1541
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:10,610
ViennaSauce?

1542
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,030
Why?

1543
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,600
I can't tell...

1544
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:18,740
Oh.

1545
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,160
Nah, I know.

1546
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,280
Oh.

1547
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,760
Three people came by today.

1548
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,360
Hello.

1549
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,080
Wait!

1550
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,140
I...

1551
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,540
I don't know.

1552
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,380
I should've been the fourth person.

1553
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,260
Hey, what's going on over here?

1554
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,900
No, I...

1555
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,660
Why would I say three people though?

1556
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,340
How would I have known that number?

1557
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,980
How would I have known that number?

1558
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:18,430
With the problems, the incidents...

1559
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:18,990
We're resolving?

1560
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:21,010
We're resolving?

1561
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,810
I'll resolve the incident.

1562
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,490
Okay, nice.

1563
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,450
Someone might have stolen my ID.

1564
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:29,970
I might be dead.

1565
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,370
I might be...

1566
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,060
L...

1567
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,440
Oh, where is it?

1568
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,780
Oh, it's over here!

1569
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:43,880
Oh no!

1570
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,240
It's solved!

1571
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,120
Oh my gosh.

1572
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,540
Oh my God, that was close.

1573
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,060
Lucky.

1574
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,900
I'm scared.

1575
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,660
I'm gonna hide over here and be Kira.

1576
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,900
I'm gonna be Kira in this room.

1577
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,060
No way.

1578
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,540
What are you doing next to me?

1579
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,120
What are you...

1580
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,360
I'm trying to up my volume.

1581
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,360
What are you doing?

1582
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,200
Me?

1583
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,960
Yeah, what are you doing?

1584
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:10,940
I wasn't next to you.

1585
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,060
I was in a storage closet.

1586
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,020
Did Kira do anything?

1587
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,700
Isn't that good?

1588
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,020
Why are we stopping Kira?

1589
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:28,820
Yeah, that's good for Kira.

1590
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,360
That's something Kira would say.

1591
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:33,280
What?

1592
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:43,060
Oh my gosh, my ID was stolen!

1593
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:43,740
My ID was stolen!

1594
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,100
Oh my God.

1595
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,480
There goes my ID.

1596
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:47,580
My ID.

1597
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,040
No!

1598
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,700
My ID.

1599
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:52,240
I was gonna say, who was it?

1600
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,820
Identity fraud is not a joke.

1601
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,940
And it didn't get stolen, so I actually think Mint might be chill.

1602
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,160
I am chill.

1603
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,660
I had contact with a lot of people today.

1604
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:07,820
I had contact with, I think, Grimmy, Doki, Snuffy, Amelie, and Mint.

1605
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,040
So, God fucking knows who it was.

1606
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,540
I think it was Doki.

1607
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,480
Because Doki's the only person I was next to.

1608
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,380
No, you weren't.

1609
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:17,920
I was there.

1610
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,360
Don't you worry.

1611
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,620
I ran away from you.

1612
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,400
No, I was right next to you.

1613
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,520
You're the only person I actually went next to.

1614
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,880
No fucking way.

1615
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,500
Look, okay.

1616
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,680
I was next to Lime and Vienna.

1617
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,200
My ID is safe.

1618
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,400
That sounds like a scam.

1619
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,480
I don't hear Lime, so God.

1620
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,140
How do I up someone's voice?

1621
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:43,720
Oh, here we go.

1622
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,420
Wait, toggle ID, what does that mean?

1623
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,340
How do I get out of here?

1624
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,560
Alright, we're setting up surveillance.

1625
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:56,760
Surveillance.

1626
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,820
I got the surveillance.

1627
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,500
Going to set it up.

1628
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,040
I'm coming over here.

1629
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:10,980
I'm setting it up.

1630
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,120
I set it up.

1631
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,020
I'm the master investigator.

1632
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,660
I have no idea where to set up the thing.

1633
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,180
Wait, no.

1634
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,120
Stay away from me.

1635
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,880
I gotta get the paper safe.

1636
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,420
I gotta keep the paper safe.

1637
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,260
Oh my gosh.

1638
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,380
S.W.

1639
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,860
One person came by today.

1640
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,860
I'm the FBI, knock knock.

1641
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,740
Oh my God.

1642
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,120
I've never been in here before.

1643
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,640
I'm gonna chill in here.

1644
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,260
I completed all my tasks.

1645
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,720
I'm just an investigator.

1646
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,720
Of course an investigator would be in the...

1647
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,240
Oh my gosh, look at the little poster of Misa.

1648
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,680
An investigator would be in the FBI...

1649
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,800
In the police office.

1650
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,020
Police...

1651
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:04,680
God, I...

1652
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,320
What?

1653
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,240
God, what?

1654
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,160
What?

1655
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,260
Your D.O.

1656
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,580
is stolen anyway, so it doesn't matter.

1657
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,620
No, stop.

1658
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,520
Stop.

1659
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,120
Stop!

1660
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,040
Oh my God!

1661
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,600
I have to investigate this person again?

1662
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,980
You're not Kira, are you?

1663
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,170
What's in here?

1664
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:29,730
Anybody, knock knock.

1665
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:30,450
Police!

1666
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:32,290
What am I doing here?

1667
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:33,570
Oh, I'm investigating.

1668
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:35,850
Investigated properly.

1669
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:40,670
Can you just like talk to random things to make it look like you're doing a task?

1670
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:41,110
No.

1671
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:49,250
Yeah, I think Doki is pretty sus because she has a sword.

1672
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:52,510
I think that.

1673
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:53,430
I think that a lot.

1674
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,370
Amelie!

1675
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,880
In here, right?

1676
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:01,420
Okay.

1677
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,660
Three people came by today.

1678
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,540
What if I just stood here with my notebook out?

1679
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,720
It would look really suspicious.

1680
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,680
It would look really suspicious.

1681
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:20,620
Okay, I've had contact.

1682
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,400
Oh, got my I.D.

1683
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:24,880
earlier.

1684
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:25,520
Wait!

1685
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,160
What's happening?

1686
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:27,920
We're dead.

1687
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,280
We're dead!

1688
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,380
Oh yeah, I've been dead for a while.

1689
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,320
No one's found my body.

1690
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:32,980
No!

1691
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,100
Oh yeah.

1692
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,200
Did Snuffy get near you?

1693
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,680
Maybe.

1694
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,940
Okay, I think it could be Giga or Snuffy.

1695
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,340
I'm freaking dead.

1696
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,380
Oh my god, they did good today.

1697
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,560
Oh my god!

1698
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,240
Wait, what?

1699
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:52,600
No!

1700
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,800
Who is...

1701
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,100
No!

1702
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:54,520
No!

1703
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:55,560
No!

1704
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,000
What happened?

1705
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,580
My god.

1706
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,120
Wait, Grimmy died too!

1707
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:01,400
Wait, what?

1708
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,520
I think they're seeing your death scene for the first time.

1709
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,900
Oh, they're seeing...

1710
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,260
No!

1711
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,280
How did I die?

1712
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,520
How did I die?

1713
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,680
Oh my god, our seats are empty.

1714
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,760
This is so sad.

1715
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,920
That was absolutely not heaven.

1716
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,240
That was...

1717
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,800
What even happens afterwards?

1718
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,340
That's the bonus cutscene.

1719
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,140
That reveal left us hanging.

1720
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:33,680
Oh my god!

1721
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,320
I like how they didn't kill the criminals, they killed us instead.

1722
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,240
Uh oh.

1723
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,600
Do you get a new ID every round?

1724
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:52,540
Or once your ID is gone, you're just in danger of getting murdered?

1725
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:53,580
I don't know.

1726
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,460
That's a good question.

1727
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,380
Speak up if you picked up a dying message.

1728
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,640
What does that mean?

1729
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:00,740
Did anyone...

1730
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:01,680
No!

1731
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,300
Oh my god, no, I didn't want to press the button!

1732
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:10,420
I think you can get your IDs back if we vote somebody out that might have your ID, we can get it back.

1733
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,540
My ID?

1734
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,460
Yeah, yeah.

1735
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,480
We should need to call somebody out.

1736
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,640
Wait, I have a dying message, where do I find it?

1737
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,920
Oh, maybe in your investigation notepad?

1738
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:20,360
Oh.

1739
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,360
And I still...

1740
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,620
Oh, I can see all the roles!

1741
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,540
You can see the roles!

1742
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:36,720
I think we need longer to do the voting if we do actually find stuff like that, because it's about to end and we haven't even...

1743
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,480
Okay, yeah, we got it.

1744
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,340
It didn't even give me a dying message when I voted!

1745
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,660
It was random, it was not targeted, I swear.

1746
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,700
None of them's a follower.

1747
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,800
It was not targeted, I just clicked as close as I could.

1748
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,700
It was Snuffy again, I can't believe this.

1749
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,760
Holy, we're gaming.

1750
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,140
Um, do I just sit here?

1751
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,440
Yeah, I think if you go...

1752
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,260
If you go to like...

1753
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:05,820
You can...

1754
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,120
Monitor another player, I'm watching Snuffy right now.

1755
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,240
Wait, if you go to what?

1756
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:10,740
I think it's...

1757
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:14,960
Like, you can select a player with E and then you can watch them run around and do stuff.

1758
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,320
Oh, okay.

1759
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,020
Oh, she found my body.

1760
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,580
Who does she see?

1761
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,520
L decoy.

1762
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,080
What is going on?

1763
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,240
Trying to kill me.

1764
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:27,380
Oh,

1765
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:33,390
no one opens a notebook?

1766
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:35,250
Snuffy's been Kira, like, twice.

1767
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,470
She's getting really good at this and none of us know what we're doing.

1768
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:37,490
I know!

1769
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:38,710
None of us know what we're doing!

1770
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,390
I need to investigate you.

1771
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,710
I need to investigate you first.

1772
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:46,990
Where did you die, Grimmy?

1773
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,590
I died in, like, the very bottom quarter.

1774
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,630
No one's gonna find my...

1775
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,730
Giga actually thought and then left, so I'm pretty sure Giga's the follower.

1776
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:54,930
There, she's doing it again.

1777
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:55,850
She's doing it again.

1778
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,610
Snuffy's killing again.

1779
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:00,490
Oh my god.

1780
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:02,790
Snuffy.

1781
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:03,850
Snuffy, don't...

1782
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,110
Look at her and her stupid ass L disguise.

1783
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,770
Oh my god, she's going into a corner to kill.

1784
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:11,530
Wait, that room has a monitor in it.

1785
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,110
Oh my god, she's sending a message.

1786
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,750
Kira.

1787
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,210
Snuffy, there's a camera out there, don't do...

1788
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,510
Yeah, there's a camera in there.

1789
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,510
Do it, do it, do it.

1790
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,310
Do it, Snuffy, I dare you.

1791
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:34,350
See what happens.

1792
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,960
I know, it's actually good, we can kind of monitor the...

1793
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,900
The bad guy and learn their ways.

1794
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:44,960
Oh, she's doing it!

1795
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,440
Oh my god!

1796
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:48,660
No!

1797
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:49,100
Live!

1798
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,060
Why is it always us?

1799
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,220
Oh my god, what the...

1800
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,080
Oh no,

1801
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:01,500
again?

1802
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,400
She's on a spree!

1803
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,880
She's on a killing spree!

1804
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,060
Oh my god.

1805
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,840
Snuffy is so sus.

1806
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,220
Be careful!

1807
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,320
Doki, sniffer out, sniffer out.

1808
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,040
Sniffy.

1809
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,960
If you're dead, you can actually see who's role is whose.

1810
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,380
If you open up the investigator list and press X, yeah, so...

1811
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,740
It's very obvious who it is.

1812
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,380
I don't see a follower though.

1813
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,580
Oh, let's see.

1814
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,260
I only see investigators and...

1815
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,460
L, Kira.

1816
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:51,620
Didn't Doki fuck up and accidentally lower the amount of followers?

1817
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:52,760
Oh, maybe.

1818
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,240
It's Snuffy versus all of us.

1819
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:56,960
Oh my god.

1820
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,060
Snuffy is killing it then.

1821
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:01,820
Literally.

1822
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,080
Oh yeah, it's just Snuffy alone.

1823
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,440
That's so funny, because Doki was like...

1824
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,720
What is Kira doing?

1825
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,180
Nothing!

1826
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,060
I know!

1827
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,040
She's doing the job of two.

1828
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,540
It's 1v8.

1829
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,940
Don't be fucking doomed though once your ID is stolen.

1830
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,640
It's basically just like, guess I'll die when Kira decides it.

1831
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,080
Right?

1832
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:29,460
Oh!

1833
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,100
Joint investigation.

1834
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,620
What does that mean?

1835
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:37,980
But like...

1836
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,020
Maybe we shouldn't announce if we got our ID stolen then?

1837
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:41,680
I don't know.

1838
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,500
Oh no, we should, because like...

1839
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,760
Kira will always know when we have our ID stolen, because they have it now.

1840
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,960
Yeah, true, true.

1841
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,140
Oh, 7 seconds.

1842
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,200
Oh my god.

1843
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,260
Snuffy is being so sus.

1844
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,860
If you're Kira's helper, you have to physically give the ID.

1845
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:04,420
Oh yeah.

1846
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,980
We can finally hear voices.

1847
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:06,900
No!

1848
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,300
I have to watch this twice when I die.

1849
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:15,800
That's weird.

1850
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:17,580
Oh my god.

1851
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,480
No!

1852
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,180
No!

1853
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:23,820
Oh no!

1854
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,260
Jiggle investigate.

1855
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,800
You're gonna dox.

1856
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,170
I have no idea what's going on.

1857
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,630
Yeah, that's what a Kira would say.

1858
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,650
That's what a Kira would say right there.

1859
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:43,490
I know it looks suspicious, but it's not fair if my game's fucked up.

1860
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:50,570
Just do your tasks!

1861
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,030
I think it's Snuffy.

1862
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:53,450
I'm...

1863
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:54,930
I'm Snuffy.

1864
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:58,430
I have no idea what's even going on, so I can't even say like...

1865
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,070
Guys, I'm doing my investigations.

1866
01:22:00,510 --> 01:22:02,210
Oh my god, all the criminals are dead!

1867
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,270
Oh my god.

1868
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,790
Wow.

1869
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:06,450
New world progress.

1870
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:10,670
I'm helping with the tasks, but I'm sorry I can't be more verbal with anybody.

1871
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:11,710
Oh!

1872
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:12,450
Oh my god!

1873
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:13,810
That's not good.

1874
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,210
Uh oh.

1875
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:16,350
That's not good.

1876
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,610
Uh oh.

1877
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,170
Guys, come on investigators.

1878
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:19,930
We're just almost there.

1879
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,390
Everybody's dead!

1880
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:22,390
This is a close one.

1881
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,130
Snuffy was alone.

1882
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,370
Oh, my idea was stolen?

1883
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:27,550
I know who was next to me.

1884
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,630
So it's either Snuffy, Joopy, or Doki.

1885
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:31,690
I know like...

1886
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:32,410
To be fair...

1887
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:36,570
I think this game is saying that if Limu were her...

1888
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,210
And Limu died!

1889
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,350
I stood next to a lot of people after that.

1890
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:43,130
And then I stood next to...

1891
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:43,810
Come on Doki!

1892
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:44,970
You know it's Snuffy!

1893
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:46,410
She's not!

1894
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,450
Sniff her out!

1895
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,170
Sniff her out!

1896
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:53,330
Good point.

1897
01:22:55,490 --> 01:22:57,490
Maybe it's Juniper because...

1898
01:22:57,490 --> 01:22:58,230
Oh my god, Doki!

1899
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:01,210
Can you help with the investigations?

1900
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,070
The two that we did?

1901
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:03,170
I did too.

1902
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,310
I did and then I saw Lime.

1903
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,450
Because I don't know.

1904
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,690
I saw and then I was going to do it.

1905
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,830
I saw Lime and...

1906
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:11,510
Oh, they're voting?

1907
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:12,850
I'm going to just fucking...

1908
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:13,130
Collapse.

1909
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:15,290
Oh my god!

1910
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:16,930
It's so over.

1911
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,090
It's so over.

1912
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,870
They're like, it's Snuffy.

1913
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:22,930
No, it can't be.

1914
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:25,910
Oh my god, she's literally just standing and...

1915
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:26,690
Oh my god!

1916
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:28,290
Doki!

1917
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:30,890
Doki!

1918
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:32,490
You deserve that.

1919
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,050
You honestly deserve that.

1920
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,010
Oh my god.

1921
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,590
No!

1922
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,510
Can you call...

1923
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:43,190
Can you call meetings in this?

1924
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:43,690
I wonder.

1925
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:45,630
I think L can.

1926
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,570
Oh my god.

1927
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:48,070
Wait a second.

1928
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,990
Oh my god.

1929
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:50,350
Oh my god.

1930
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:51,670
Wait, who killed you?

1931
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:52,630
Who killed you guys?

1932
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,290
What are you talking about?

1933
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:55,210
It's Snuffy.

1934
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:56,670
I'm ready to go.

1935
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:57,310
I told you!

1936
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,270
I fucking...

1937
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,710
I was like, it has to be Snuffy.

1938
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:01,250
It has to be Snuffy.

1939
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,490
The camera's right there.

1940
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,410
Nobody believed me.

1941
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:03,970
Oh my god.

1942
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,770
Wait, who is...

1943
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:06,070
But...

1944
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,910
Juniper is L and there's a...

1945
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:10,470
Snuffy is like killing people right in front of the camera.

1946
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,610
And nobody believed me.

1947
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:14,730
I fucking knew it.

1948
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:15,330
I...

1949
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,050
I knew it.

1950
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:19,310
I'm gonna fucking pee in anger.

1951
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:20,050
I'll be right back.

1952
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:24,830
Oh wait, they just revealed Vienna's role.

1953
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,470
So now everybody will know that it's Snuffy.

1954
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:31,710
I don't think they know that those people are dead though.

1955
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:32,450
Yeah.

1956
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,310
True.

1957
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,370
They don't see it until the end of the round.

1958
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:35,890
Oh, true.

1959
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,350
I think...

1960
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:40,950
Oh no.

1961
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,330
This is so bad.

1962
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,370
They're not gonna make it.

1963
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:49,650
Oh my gosh.

1964
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:50,810
Stay away.

1965
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:51,770
Stay away.

1966
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,150
All she needs is your ID.

1967
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:59,350
I actually wonder if balance wise it's better to have shorter rounds.

1968
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,810
Because it feels like it's way too easy to steal everybody's fucking IDs at this point.

1969
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,290
Yeah, yeah.

1970
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,910
Oh my god.

1971
01:25:07,390 --> 01:25:08,690
This is stressing me out.

1972
01:25:09,550 --> 01:25:11,470
I wish I could move around as a ghost.

1973
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:14,650
I know, you can watch the people but you can't move.

1974
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,610
You have to like pick one to spectate.

1975
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,590
You open your little investigator list and click on somebody.

1976
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,470
Oh, it's literally like...

1977
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,610
Wait, it's like they have to just figure out...

1978
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:33,510
Is it just one Kira and then it's Vienna and Juniper against Snuffy?

1979
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,930
Yeah, there's no Kira helper for some reason.

1980
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:36,490
Yeah.

1981
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,390
Oh, I guess it's like random.

1982
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,750
Random.

1983
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:47,130
Oh my god, can you get hit by the car?

1984
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,790
What just happened?

1985
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:51,770
Can you imagine after all that Kira gets hit by a car?

1986
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,230
Oh my god.

1987
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:58,630
Oh my god.

1988
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:00,550
Oh no, she's making her move.

1989
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,870
Oh my god.

1990
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,610
No, no, no, she's investigating.

1991
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,110
She's stealing IDs.

1992
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,290
She's stealing IDs.

1993
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:09,030
This is so bad.

1994
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:11,170
It's not me.

1995
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,310
It's not me.

1996
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:14,630
It's not me.

1997
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:15,790
It's not me.

1998
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:22,570
Wait, so the further the days go, do like more events happen?

1999
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,250
That's kind of fun.

2000
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:28,350
Yeah, they start saying different things like the witnesses.

2001
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:29,230
Yeah.

2002
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,860
Please, please just...

2003
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,740
Elle, call a meeting, Elle.

2004
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,080
I know, call a meeting.

2005
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,140
You know that there's only three of you left.

2006
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,340
Who's Elle?

2007
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,600
It's uh...

2008
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:45,940
Juniper.

2009
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:46,180
Juniper, yeah.

2010
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:46,920
Juniper.

2011
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,760
We're just letting Stuffy do whatever she wants!

2012
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:54,180
God, but she knew I was out there and she took my life!

2013
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,840
Are you guys having trouble getting back in, like the invites aren't working?

2014
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,140
Can you trace over the invites?

2015
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:00,560
Yeah, I can invite her.

2016
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,920
I think we have to be in the lobby again.

2017
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,340
Yeah.

2018
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,520
Oh, maybe.

2019
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,100
Yeah, okay.

2020
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,900
Fucking knew it.

2021
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,000
I knew she wasn't...

2022
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,080
I knew she wasn't real.

2023
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,760
How does she keep getting Elle though?

2024
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:12,920
I mean Kira, I mean.

2025
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,980
I think, I don't know, I think there's just something about her.

2026
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,320
It's that stupid Elle costume.

2027
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,040
I like it though.

2028
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:25,980
I'll post your names on the internet!

2029
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,520
Oh my god, it's you!

2030
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,080
Damn, look at him.

2031
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:32,720
It's me.

2032
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,060
With your sword!

2033
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:36,500
No!

2034
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,400
Juniper, I swear to god.

2035
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:40,860
Oh my god.

2036
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:46,700
One of us is Elle, one of us is Kira, and one of us is like John Adam.

2037
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,140
It's Snuffy!

2038
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,860
I swear it's Snuffy!

2039
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:54,100
You guys saw that Vienna is... Vienna is an investigator, it's Snuffy!

2040
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:01,140
No, I sucked you two to work together because all three of us were in a room together.

2041
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:04,220
And I was like, this is how I can prove to them that I'm safe!

2042
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,480
It's Snuffy!

2043
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:06,840
It's Snuffy!

2044
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,840
We did it!

2045
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,140
We did it!

2046
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,820
That would be too obvious if you just couldn't pick them.

2047
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:19,640
Then if you tried to assign an investigation to somebody like that, it would just be like, sorry, that guy's evil, you can't pick them.

2048
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,900
It happens.

2049
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,680
Oh my god.

2050
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,720
Snuffy, you are talking so good right now, but I...

2051
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:32,180
I can't say anything because I can't hear anybody, so I'm just...

2052
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:34,040
You are talking so fucking good!

2053
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:37,780
He's using the I can't hear anybody excuse.

2054
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:40,060
I can't hear anyone.

2055
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,980
It's a game, it's glitched.

2056
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,460
I mean, she legitimately cut him.

2057
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:48,620
Oh my god, here it is.

2058
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,660
Sweet justice, sweet justice.

2059
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,820
I wish we could hear you during the round.

2060
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:56,620
What, you can't hear me either?

2061
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,300
I can't hear anybody and you can't hear me?

2062
01:28:58,380 --> 01:28:59,920
You were like running at me.

2063
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,960
I was trying to tell Junia how to investigate her.

2064
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,520
Ta-da!

2065
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,640
How did we win that?

2066
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,100
Oh my god.

2067
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,340
How did we win?

2068
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,980
Why didn't you tell us?

2069
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,000
I'm so confused.

2070
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,720
There's a maximum amount of people you can kill every day, so I just tried to write everybody's names down.

2071
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,520
And I was just like, you can't kill any people until the next day.

2072
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:51,940
So it was basically like me blindly picking because I had nobody to give me like IDs or tell me anything.

2073
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,060
Oh my god.

2074
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:53,920
That's so sad.

2075
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,900
I think it must be random then.

2076
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:56,720
Maybe.

2077
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,560
Both times I can't hear anybody.

2078
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,920
So that was genuinely a thing though.

2079
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,620
That's weird.

2080
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,280
I don't know.

2081
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,100
Maybe we...let's send another invite to Val so you can join them.

2082
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:08,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2083
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,600
I just sent an invite to her.

2084
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,420
I just sent it.

2085
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:12,740
That's so weird that you couldn't hear anybody because we could hear you.

2086
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:15,420
We might have to restart the lobby because she got a connection fail.

2087
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,240
It says room full.

2088
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:17,180
I think it's because she DC'd.

2089
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,020
Restart.

2090
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:19,420
Restart.

2091
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,140
Restart.

2092
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,000
Oh my goodness.

2093
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:27,760
This game is kind of whack.

2094
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:35,800
I think I'm...I still feel it's way more balanced towards Kira still.

2095
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,860
It's too difficult to see who's doing the tasks.

2096
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,120
You know, like...I rather...I wish it was like more varied tasks where it's not just...

2097
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,880
Oh, I'm going to go investigate this person.

2098
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,900
I'm going to ask Doki if she can...

2099
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,580
Add Doki.

2100
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,100
Can you add more tasks?

2101
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,100
Because I feel like...

2102
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:56,200
It's like...

2103
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,100
With at least like Among Us...

2104
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,080
You have various tasks so it's like did someone have garbage?

2105
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,300
Oh yeah, I did garbage.

2106
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,100
But this one it feels a little more tricky where it's like...

2107
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:10,160
Did you talk to Sakura person?

2108
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:11,760
Yeah, I talked to Sakura person.

2109
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:15,540
Oh, there was no Sakura person...Sakura TV person.

2110
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:16,220
It's weird.

2111
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:16,700
I don't know.

2112
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,600
Reading people's inbox.

2113
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:23,740
My bad.

2114
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:24,720
My bad.

2115
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,320
Did it happen again?

2116
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,280
It is more complex.

2117
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,760
Yeah, it is more complex.

2118
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,380
I'm not understanding anything.

2119
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:36,320
That's okay.

2120
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:37,780
That's okay.

2121
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,160
It is a silly game though.

2122
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:43,460
I love this outfit.

2123
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,140
Can you guys hear me?

2124
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,360
We can hear you.

2125
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:49,280
Okay, I'm genuinely wondering...

2126
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,820
If you get Kira and you can't hear people...

2127
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:55,960
It seems almost like it's intentional because I can start hearing people almost immediately as voting starts...

2128
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:56,920
But I don't know why it would be the other way around.

2129
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,680
Oh, maybe.

2130
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,480
I don't know if that's like...

2131
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,260
No, no, no, no.

2132
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:03,260
That would be stupid because like...

2133
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:05,520
Then it's really obvious you just woke up to someone and you're like...

2134
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,240
Hey, can you hear me?

2135
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,700
If they don't respond, it's them.

2136
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,800
Yeah, like who's playing completely dumb here and doesn't even understand what's happening?

2137
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:17,440
I think it might have picked your VR headset as a device or something.

2138
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,740
You sound like you're in an empty room now.

2139
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,100
Yeah.

2140
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,300
Oh, maybe it changed.

2141
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:21,400
Maybe it changed though.

2142
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,400
Yeah.

2143
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,800
I don't know why it says like maximum is one because the literally trailer was like...

2144
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,600
You could get up to five followers.

2145
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:29,520
I'm like, what?

2146
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,360
You can apparently only have one follower for Kira.

2147
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,160
Is that a one or a zero?

2148
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,280
Wait, but...

2149
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,640
It's only a lobby of ten.

2150
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,420
How would you have five followers?

2151
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:41,200
That's insane.

2152
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,380
That's much better.

2153
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:42,900
Thank you.

2154
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:43,840
Thank you.

2155
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:45,480
Okay, let's see.

2156
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,160
Of course.

2157
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,700
I'm doing meeting time longer too.

2158
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,860
I know you would tell me if I sounded like shit snuffy, so I'll tell you the same.

2159
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:52,880
I don't have a snuffy girl.

2160
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:53,980
I knew you would want to know.

2161
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:55,640
Yeah, for sure.

2162
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,620
I'm going to make it super fast.

2163
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:00,740
Okay.

2164
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,340
I'll play your song, I see you.

2165
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,960
Oh yeah, and I didn't have a follower that time.

2166
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,640
I don't know what happened.

2167
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,740
Yeah, because I put random...

2168
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,600
I put random and it like makes it so that...

2169
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,980
Oh my God, it's completely...

2170
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,000
What if nobody got Kira?

2171
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,820
Oh my God.

2172
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:16,420
That would be very funny.

2173
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:22,180
I like how at the start of the last round, you sat in front of a camera writing like four names in your fucking notebook.

2174
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,340
I know, I noticed that.

2175
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:24,380
I didn't think...

2176
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:26,900
I was like, this game must be like, you know, I don't have a follower.

2177
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,800
So I was like, kind of like just fucking around.

2178
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,200
You were just like, I'm going to write everybody in.

2179
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:35,100
I know, I just started writing down names like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

2180
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,980
Who am I missing, guys?

2181
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:38,720
Who am I missing?

2182
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:40,740
Who's missing?

2183
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:42,400
Who's missing?

2184
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:45,380
Uh...

2185
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:49,700
Oh guys, it'd be very awkward on the person that...

2186
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:50,020
Juniper!

2187
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,120
Oh no, Juniper's right there.

2188
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:52,500
Just kidding.

2189
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,100
Amelie!

2190
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2191
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,700
She has like a weird name.

2192
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,540
Was a new invite set.

2193
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,080
Oh no!

2194
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,100
Amelie is waiting for an invite, I think.

2195
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:00,460
Yeah.

2196
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2197
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,540
No, I just forgot she changed her name to the have mercy one.

2198
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,440
Okay, oh yeah, I have more tasks too.

2199
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,660
Okay, how do I...

2200
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:08,980
Alright.

2201
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,180
For which one?

2202
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,560
For L and Kira, right?

2203
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,140
I think...

2204
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:15,900
Yeah, just more things to do, I think.

2205
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:16,700
Yeah.

2206
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,940
I don't know if we wanna...

2207
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:22,860
I don't know if it's worth reducing the amount of time in a day...

2208
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:25,860
Because it feels like most of the IDs can get stolen in one round.

2209
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,540
But I don't know.

2210
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:30,620
I'll make it less than, I'll do 60 seconds instead of 90.

2211
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:31,620
Okay.

2212
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:32,160
Okay.

2213
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:32,920
Yeah, and then we'll see.

2214
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,040
I made it super fast.

2215
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:34,960
Actually, no, I shouldn't.

2216
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,000
Maybe I'll make us not super fast.

2217
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,360
Uh...

2218
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,700
More time to talk, for sure.

2219
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,380
Yeah.

2220
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:42,540
Let's see.

2221
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:43,640
Day, night, tasks.

2222
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,540
I put four tasks.

2223
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,300
I'll do four tasks.

2224
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:48,740
And then...

2225
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:51,460
I think that's good, right?

2226
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,240
Four tasks.

2227
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,100
Or should we add more?

2228
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,000
Two was the default.

2229
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:55,920
Four should be fine.

2230
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,540
Yeah, four should be okay.

2231
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:56,960
Four is good.

2232
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,220
It's gonna be really good.

2233
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,060
Let's see how it runs.

2234
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,260
Yeah, we can always adjust.

2235
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,300
No worries.

2236
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,300
Alright, start game.

2237
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,860
Let's go, baby.

2238
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,760
Kira, Kira, Kira, Kira.

2239
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:12,040
I will never be Kira.

2240
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:15,260
Stop being so cute.

2241
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,840
What are you talking about?

2242
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,800
Here we go.

2243
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:29,620
Hello.

2244
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,160
I have to give an item to Bobear.

2245
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:34,940
Okay.

2246
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,120
Good luck with that.

2247
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,420
Good luck with that.

2248
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:37,980
What am I doing?

2249
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,480
NPCs.

2250
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:42,080
Questioning.

2251
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:48,060
It should be possible to identify Kira if you have all information of the events.

2252
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:49,400
What does that mean?

2253
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:53,840
In here?

2254
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,280
No.

2255
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:56,200
Wait.

2256
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:56,820
No.

2257
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:57,680
Wait.

2258
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:58,100
No.

2259
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,720
What am I...

2260
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,520
Oh, I'm monitoring.

2261
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:10,810
I'm going around without my mic on this time, guys.

2262
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:13,350
Someone must...

2263
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:13,490
Oh.

2264
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:14,890
We have help.

2265
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:16,130
Vindicating evidence.

2266
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:16,950
How did they get this?

2267
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:17,690
So fast.

2268
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,070
Wait, what are we doing?

2269
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:22,850
Investigators can make contact with...

2270
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:24,330
And prevent role reviews?

2271
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:25,170
Oh.

2272
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:27,070
Okay.

2273
01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:28,490
Interesting.

2274
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:29,890
Vienna is an investigator.

2275
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:31,270
We now...

2276
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:32,590
Why does it always choose Vienna?

2277
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,350
I think this game has a...

2278
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,810
Oh, no!

2279
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:39,130
This game has a bit of a...

2280
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:40,850
Uh-oh.

2281
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:42,570
Resolving, resolving.

2282
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:44,650
Oh, my God.

2283
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:45,470
Oh, my God.

2284
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:46,990
I'm following Grimmie.

2285
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:48,850
Following Grimmien.

2286
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:49,850
We're going.

2287
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,190
Someone might...

2288
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,170
Wait, how do I do this?

2289
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:55,970
Why is it not letting me do it?

2290
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:56,530
There we go.

2291
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:57,910
We're resolving?

2292
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:58,550
We're resolving?

2293
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:00,870
Hello.

2294
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:02,130
Who's not resolving?

2295
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,190
There's three people in here.

2296
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:04,910
I'm trying to.

2297
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,370
I have an item with me.

2298
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:07,130
I don't know what to do.

2299
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:08,550
An item?

2300
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:11,670
It's not letting me investigate.

2301
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:12,450
I swear to you.

2302
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:13,770
Please don't select me as Kira.

2303
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:14,610
You will regret it.

2304
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:15,270
I'm sorry.

2305
01:37:15,390 --> 01:37:16,290
I can't tell you more.

2306
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:21,210
Interesting.

2307
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:28,940
That's right.

2308
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:30,120
Oh, my gosh.

2309
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:32,120
There's so many NPCs I need to question.

2310
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,480
So many people need questioning.

2311
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,360
So many people that need questioning.

2312
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,820
What are you doing up there, Grimmie?

2313
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:47,260
Don't worry.

2314
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:47,900
Here.

2315
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,600
I have to monitor.

2316
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:51,840
Found it on the ground.

2317
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,520
I give back.

2318
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,160
Here you go.

2319
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,180
I'm monitoring you real quick, Vienna.

2320
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,220
Wait, I don't know what I just did.

2321
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,040
What did we just do?

2322
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:01,880
Can I monitor you, please?

2323
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:07,920
Okay, I'm going that way.

2324
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:09,880
Oh, no.

2325
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,800
There's not enough time left.

2326
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:12,440
Oh, my gosh.

2327
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:13,820
There's not enough time left.

2328
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:14,780
No!

2329
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,180
My joint task!

2330
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:18,660
Oh, my gosh.

2331
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:19,060
Here?

2332
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,580
Why is he so...

2333
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,520
How did someone get murdered already?

2334
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:29,620
Oh, my God!

2335
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,200
Oh, my God!

2336
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:34,400
He's so shit!

2337
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:40,940
Oh, my God!

2338
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,680
Guys, gotta be careful.

2339
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,140
I put a safety on.

2340
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,360
I literally just talking to Snuffy.

2341
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,200
Holy shit!

2342
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,080
That's so GG.

2343
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:54,760
No, Snuffy!

2344
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,880
But they were working with Minto.

2345
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,540
It was a Nerf gun.

2346
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:01,960
I don't know what happened.

2347
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:07,180
There was like 10 seconds left when we had this collaboration.

2348
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,240
And I couldn't do anything.

2349
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:15,360
Okay, so is it not Snuffy that...

2350
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:15,680
Oh, wait.

2351
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:16,580
Snuffy is dead.

2352
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,440
Probably not Snuffy, I'd say, yeah.

2353
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,600
It's a new person because they're not doing anything.

2354
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,400
Abby was stolen.

2355
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:30,300
Blackaddy was stolen too.

2356
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,900
Mine was stolen.

2357
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:34,960
We were all investigating that body.

2358
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,240
Investigated me and Blackaddy did not get stolen.

2359
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:39,620
So I don't think it's Minto or Limu.

2360
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:41,380
It's not me.

2361
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:42,420
I...

2362
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,360
We know it's not Vienna too, so...

2363
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,280
Wait, why do we know it's not you guys?

2364
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,560
I was...

2365
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,760
Grimmy, who was investigating the body with us?

2366
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,460
Because it announced that it wasn't Vienna.

2367
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,880
Yeah, it said it was stolen.

2368
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:58,040
My idea was stolen while I was investigating it.

2369
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:01,160
I was by myself first and then four people surrounded me.

2370
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:07,440
So it was... I couldn't even see who the four was because I was investigating that body first.

2371
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:11,000
I know that I was in close contact with Grimmy a couple of times.

2372
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:16,660
The people that I've been near are Bao and Grimmy, I think.

2373
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:19,780
Wait, whose ID got stolen again?

2374
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,640
My ID got stolen.

2375
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,060
Mine.

2376
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:25,520
Because I was in that body thing on the top left.

2377
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,040
Oh, okay.

2378
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,620
I was with Grimmy back during that.

2379
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,000
And someone else.

2380
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:35,040
So maybe Bao pretended to want a property.

2381
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,300
But I did give you stuff back though.

2382
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,480
And I was giving a lost package back.

2383
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:41,980
It's not my ID though.

2384
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,480
I've still lost that, so...

2385
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,220
I don't think we have enough evidence.

2386
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,980
Yeah, why did you give back her ID?

2387
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,580
I don't think it's actually lost packages or not IDs.

2388
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:59,820
It said deliver package and I was trying to go around to deliver the one package back.

2389
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,860
And I had the ID to give back to you.

2390
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:05,020
Toki, why are you investigator investigator?

2391
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,800
Investigator investigator.

2392
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,620
You can change your name tag.

2393
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:18,060
You can change your name tag in the customization.

2394
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:22,900
I'm here.

2395
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,840
All of my lonesome.

2396
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,460
I'm investigating.

2397
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,660
No one's been here.

2398
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,660
Going to the meeting room.

2399
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:44,890
Where is that?

2400
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:53,600
If he kills people who oppose him, even if they're innocent, then Kira is really just a murderer.

2401
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,340
I don't think it's Grimmie, you guys.

2402
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,120
I don't think it's Grimmie.

2403
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:03,560
Grimmie was down here while everybody whose wallets got stolen were up in the left.

2404
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,260
So I really don't think it's her.

2405
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:11,680
Amelie is...

2406
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,760
Oh, okay.

2407
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,140
I don't think it's Amelie.

2408
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:19,780
Because she... Why would he say something about Transceiver otherwise?

2409
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:21,780
Oh, okay.

2410
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:24,100
Interesting.

2411
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:26,980
Oh my gosh, there's so many more!

2412
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:29,240
There's so many more now!

2413
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:31,620
WD.

2414
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,220
Okay.

2415
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,660
Oh, and I gotta monitor someone.

2416
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:36,300
Oh my gosh.

2417
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,700
Am I gonna be able to do all this?

2418
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:39,360
Holy cow.

2419
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,300
Maybe there's too many tasks now.

2420
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:46,100
I rather... I just wanted like a variety of tasks.

2421
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,360
But it's just talk to people and...

2422
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,240
Someone supposedly handed off a black notebook during...

2423
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:55,420
Wait, so there is a follower.

2424
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,720
I think we have a follower this time.

2425
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:03,320
Oh my gosh!

2426
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:03,880
The car!

2427
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:05,380
What the hell just happened?

2428
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,020
Wait, did someone die?

2429
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:07,080
Okay.

2430
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,620
Three people...

2431
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:12,400
Did someone die?

2432
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:16,040
I'm going to go check.

2433
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,040
Who died?

2434
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:22,760
What?

2435
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,940
Oh my god.

2436
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,460
I'll post your names on the internet!

2437
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:33,860
Oh my god!

2438
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,500
Oh my god!

2439
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,060
The isekai truck!

2440
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,660
She's in a better place now.

2441
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,180
Those 3D models in this look so good.

2442
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:47,620
Like Kira?

2443
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:48,260
I know!

2444
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,240
They look really good.

2445
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,440
Kira looks so good.

2446
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:52,820
Oh my god.

2447
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,080
I was doing a joint thing with Amelie and she just collapsed next to me.

2448
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:02,600
I was like, Amelie, what's going on?

2449
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,480
She stopped talking and then she just passed out.

2450
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,660
Oh my gosh.

2451
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:14,480
Come on, do your tasks, everybody.

2452
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,060
There we go.

2453
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,620
We're doing our tasks right now.

2454
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:19,980
It's really hard to win by doing tasks.

2455
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,660
Level 41 is crazy.

2456
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:22,720
Yeah.

2457
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,900
Oh my god!

2458
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:26,820
Three.

2459
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:28,180
Three of them.

2460
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:29,960
That means three died, right?

2461
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,520
Cause the last one was like...

2462
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:31,840
Zero.

2463
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:32,920
Yeah.

2464
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,540
Uh oh.

2465
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:38,900
Hmm.

2466
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:46,260
Well, I was with Amelie doing a joint investigation and then she collapsed.

2467
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:47,220
Right next to you.

2468
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:48,880
I think there's also...

2469
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,120
I think there's a follower this round too.

2470
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:59,380
Because one of the little people that I investigated said that they saw someone passing off the notebook.

2471
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,060
Like the little NPC.

2472
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:04,120
Oh, wait.

2473
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,160
Which side was it?

2474
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:06,860
Which... Do you remember?

2475
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:08,700
Maybe you can open the map with M.

2476
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,920
Was it in the beginning or the middle?

2477
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,820
It was when it was daytime.

2478
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:18,120
It was the one by the... It said in the classroom that they passed it off.

2479
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:23,060
I think it's... I think it's maybe Vau and Juniper.

2480
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:25,320
It is...

2481
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,220
I mean, I can't really say anything to defend myself, but it's not me.

2482
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,060
Puts hands up.

2483
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:31,240
I got an investigation.

2484
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,000
Puts hands up.

2485
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:32,860
Very convincing.

2486
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:35,020
Yeah, in a very submissive way.

2487
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:38,860
I get like really submissive.

2488
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,540
I like lay on the ground, I roll over, I show my belly.

2489
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,180
Okay, well, I'm gonna pee on the floor.

2490
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,980
There's a giant puddle of pee underneath me.

2491
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:49,420
I think that's our culprit.

2492
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:50,480
And I hate being anything...

2493
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:54,740
I hate being anything that involves me having to lie.

2494
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,260
I pick investigator literally every time.

2495
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:58,300
Let's go!

2496
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:01,060
So...

2497
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:05,460
I got a dying message from Snuffy, but I don't really understand it.

2498
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:08,140
So I think that was a confession, right, Vau?

2499
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,460
How is that a confession?

2500
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:15,020
Right?

2501
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:16,600
You can read people's notebooks by...

2502
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:19,300
If you go into like the thing, it'll show you which ones they have marked off.

2503
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:20,760
Oh god, there's ten seconds, never mind!

2504
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,260
I don't know, I don't know!

2505
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:24,940
It's Juniper!

2506
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:25,820
It's not Juniper!

2507
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:26,800
It's not Juniper!

2508
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:26,960
It's Juniper!

2509
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,220
It's not Juniper!

2510
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:30,960
Wait, it's not Juniper.

2511
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:31,540
How do we know?

2512
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,820
Yo, I'm chill.

2513
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,000
Let me do it.

2514
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:40,340
Oh my gosh!

2515
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:43,120
You're going downtown, Charlie Brown!

2516
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,720
Yep, you're going into Slammer.

2517
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,420
Why didn't you even do anything?

2518
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,280
So, poor Claim, standard investigator.

2519
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,300
Get back!

2520
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,800
I can explain.

2521
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,020
Got it.

2522
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:06,280
Now you killed too many people.

2523
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:07,520
The moment I gave...

2524
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:11,280
I thought I was supposed to!

2525
01:47:11,620 --> 01:47:15,900
The moment I gave her the notebook, she killed everybody.

2526
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:18,580
Wait!

2527
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,120
Oh my gosh, it was you!

2528
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,960
Is that not the point of the death note?

2529
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,500
You did it so cool!

2530
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:31,680
I just thought if I murked everyone, I'd win!

2531
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,160
She went fucking wild!

2532
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:37,420
She was like...

2533
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:39,320
She was crazy with it, damn!

2534
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:45,180
I could have sworn that was the point of the book called the death note!

2535
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,840
Oh my gosh.

2536
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,260
I could be my favorite character.

2537
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:51,920
Me too!

2538
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,440
Oh, is it time?

2539
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:57,020
Oh my gosh, we're all this ugly ass.

2540
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:04,400
What the hell is this version of Kira?

2541
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,700
Why is there this version and this?

2542
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,340
I'm investigator, investigator.

2543
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,200
You're gonna be investigator, investigator.

2544
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:14,680
Yeah!

2545
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:20,240
I legitimately thought it was like only Kira's can be investigator.

2546
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,280
I was like, wait a minute.

2547
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,500
But I was like, oh my gosh, I changed it.

2548
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,340
We have so many more new characters now, it's so exciting.

2549
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:27,720
Oh yeah.

2550
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,220
I don't remember this guy.

2551
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:32,260
Misa is so ugly, I can't...

2552
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:36,880
Dude, it's so crazy that you have to pay money to be cute in Moe.

2553
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,440
I know!

2554
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,940
That's not just me, but...

2555
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,960
It's brilliant, honestly.

2556
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,380
That's how they get you.

2557
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,200
Yeah!

2558
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:51,660
There's like the Nendoroids and then there's the little bootleg figures.

2559
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:52,960
Nendos!

2560
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:55,840
Oh my god.

2561
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:58,000
Which way, western man?

2562
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:04,380
I don't know what this says.

2563
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:11,300
I'm also saying this because I dogged on Doki pretty hard for this, but it's only because I did the same thing.

2564
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:16,520
But if you get Kira and one of those things happen, do not read out loud that it says to judge people.

2565
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,020
Do not read out loud!

2566
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:22,440
Investigators don't see the judging thing.

2567
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:26,680
Nobody noticed, except for Snuffy, so I was like, you're out.

2568
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:27,480
You're out of the game.

2569
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:32,480
Same thing, and I was like, I said it out loud, and I was like, wait, that sounds like something that only...

2570
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,100
But I forgot.

2571
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,380
Snuffy literally told me, and I forgot.

2572
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:37,240
And that's why I made Snuffy shoot herself.

2573
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:39,280
That was so good.

2574
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:44,180
But you, Kira, until you pass off the death note, and then the other person becomes Kira?

2575
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they become Kira.

2576
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,520
You can make somebody else cute up.

2577
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:51,940
So when I gave my notebook to Bao, she went fucking crazy.

2578
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:53,580
She was like, I found it.

2579
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:58,380
Bao was like frothing at the mouth, like, finally.

2580
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:07,540
Wait, that's also interesting then, because that means that the collaboration things that happen with L aren't always the safe people.

2581
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,540
No, no, no, you don't know the safe L, basically.

2582
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:11,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2583
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:12,700
Okay, interesting.

2584
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,380
Or putting two people together and seeing what happens.

2585
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:15,800
Okay.

2586
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:21,200
Yeah, you see, like, if they get together and the other person died.

2587
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,780
Alright, are you guys ready?

2588
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:23,480
Yeah!

2589
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,100
Oh, no!

2590
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,400
Every single time!

2591
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,460
Stay safe out there.

2592
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:54,700
Stay safe out there.

2593
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,000
Wait, okay.

2594
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,160
Let's go talk to some... Oh, not that person.

2595
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:04,900
Wait, person in here.

2596
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,620
Juniper, can I monitor you respectfully?

2597
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:19,100
Oh my god.

2598
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,000
Oh, wait, oh.

2599
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,800
Excuse me.

2600
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:24,180
Wait.

2601
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:27,880
What's happening?

2602
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:30,580
Oh, wait.

2603
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,440
What's happening?

2604
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,360
How do I...

2605
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:41,370
Oh, there we are.

2606
01:51:41,470 --> 01:51:43,870
Okay, I'm monitoring respectfully.

2607
01:51:44,570 --> 01:51:46,030
Thank you.

2608
01:51:48,730 --> 01:51:49,150
What?

2609
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:50,430
Why?

2610
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:53,390
Why are you talking to me?

2611
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:55,450
I'm investigating this spot.

2612
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:57,710
Wait.

2613
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:01,210
We have to investigate.

2614
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:06,430
What is this?

2615
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,140
Oh my god, wait, this way?

2616
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:31,040
Can someone help me in here?

2617
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,100
Oh, I'm here.

2618
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,840
Sorry, I forgot to press the...

2619
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:34,580
The thingy.

2620
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:35,020
There we go.

2621
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:35,560
Thank you.

2622
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,710
Yeah, this person's dead.

2623
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:44,150
Sure looks dead to me.

2624
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:47,190
I don't believe how dead they are, holy shit.

2625
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:48,310
Nah, freaking dead.

2626
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,010
Yay!

2627
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:11,960
She did not... Did she see me...

2628
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,700
Did she see me writing at the death note?

2629
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,700
I don't think she saw.

2630
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:22,160
Okay.

2631
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,180
Who am I following?

2632
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:25,360
Oh.

2633
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,780
Amelie, I would like to follow you respectfully.

2634
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,300
Oh, may I judge you respectfully?

2635
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:33,160
Respectfully, may I judge you Amelie?

2636
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,220
Oh.

2637
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,840
Yeah, thank you.

2638
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:38,980
Thank you.

2639
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:44,660
What's happening?

2640
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:45,300
Oh my god.

2641
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,400
Oh my god!

2642
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:50,600
Jesus, oh my god.

2643
01:53:52,220 --> 01:53:53,100
Holy shit.

2644
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,660
Eyes wide open.

2645
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,560
No, she knew too much!

2646
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,400
She looked up.

2647
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,660
Who found her notebook?

2648
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:05,700
I have her notebook, but she had nothing in it.

2649
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:06,940
She was not doing her homework.

2650
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:10,460
Literally, I was like, I looked in it and like, nothing.

2651
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,520
I'll be honest, I don't do my homework.

2652
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:15,520
Are you supposed to... Wait, it doesn't put in the names automatically?

2653
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:19,680
You're supposed to put notes on who you think is like, most suspicious.

2654
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:20,660
Oh.

2655
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,280
Yeah, so you click on them.

2656
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,640
Um, before Donofer died...

2657
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,520
Before she died, she said...

2658
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,200
Yeah, yeah, she told me in Vienna.

2659
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:31,720
Though Vienna did steal my ID, so I don't know.

2660
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:34,360
Yes, you did!

2661
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,480
My ID was stolen!

2662
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,100
I still have my ID.

2663
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:43,020
No, I don't...

2664
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:43,300
Wait.

2665
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:44,060
No!

2666
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,020
Wait, why do you think F is Kira?

2667
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:52,680
Hey, question, can Kira followers help you with the incident resolution?

2668
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:54,000
Yeah, they can help.

2669
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,260
Okay, the only person that was close...

2670
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:57,260
Everybody can help you, I think you can do that.

2671
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:58,640
Oh...

2672
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:02,020
Kira was an incident really close, and Mint ran away from it.

2673
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,440
Instead of going to one that was closer.

2674
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:04,660
Oh, no, I went to one!

2675
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:05,520
I went to one!

2676
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:09,820
Someone was talking through Transceiver near Hotel Teton during the day.

2677
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:14,520
On the bottom portion of the map, someone was seen at night...

2678
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,720
holding a notebook and opening it.

2679
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:25,200
Does increasing the amount of tasks you can do in a day make the progress bar need more to fill up?

2680
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,260
Because it actually feels like it's even longer now.

2681
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:27,660
Longer, right?

2682
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,460
Is it longer?

2683
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:30,060
It feels like it.

2684
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:30,380
I think so.

2685
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:34,000
It feels like we're filling up less based on the levels we're getting.

2686
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,780
Yeah, I think I actually made it longer now.

2687
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,360
It's also really hard to get to everybody.

2688
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,420
I don't know.

2689
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:43,520
I think because you also lowered the day too, right?

2690
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2691
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,180
Also, so Vienna, why do you think it's Snuffy?

2692
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:50,020
Juniper said it was Snuffy.

2693
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,280
And now she's dead.

2694
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:54,940
Okay, Loki, I feel stupid about it.

2695
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:55,500
What did she say?

2696
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,200
She said it was Snuffy and she's dead now.

2697
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,520
She said it was Snuffy because...

2698
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:01,740
You know what?

2699
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:02,280
Let's do it.

2700
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,020
Let's take a shot.

2701
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:03,540
I don't think it's Snuffy.

2702
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,240
I don't think it's Snuffy.

2703
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:06,420
Let's take a shot.

2704
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:07,700
I have a confession to make.

2705
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,580
Yeah, that seems like a confession right there.

2706
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:10,220
I have a confession.

2707
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:11,320
No, no, no.

2708
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:12,700
I can't hear anybody.

2709
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,760
I can't hear anybody.

2710
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:14,720
I tried to text her.

2711
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,740
I was texting her.

2712
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:16,240
Again?

2713
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:17,220
Again?

2714
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:18,360
Oh, I remember.

2715
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,040
Again?

2716
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:21,380
I'm not going to say anything more than that.

2717
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,300
You can judge based on that.

2718
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:23,640
But I literally can't figure it out.

2719
01:56:23,780 --> 01:56:24,880
I can't figure out anything.

2720
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:26,700
She was pecking an NPC.

2721
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,360
And the NPC said no one had visited.

2722
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:29,800
But Snuffy was there.

2723
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,080
I can't hear anybody.

2724
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,280
Like anybody at all this time.

2725
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,540
It's just getting worse every game.

2726
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:34,800
I hear less and less people.

2727
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,180
She literally can't hear.

2728
01:56:40,260 --> 01:56:41,040
I'm not cute, by the way, though.

2729
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:41,500
I'm not cute.

2730
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:43,560
Are you bad?

2731
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:46,980
Are you a little bad?

2732
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:47,800
Are you...

2733
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:48,160
A little bad?

2734
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:49,580
Oh, nothing.

2735
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:50,420
Oh my gosh!

2736
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:51,240
It is a person!

2737
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:51,940
Oh God.

2738
01:56:58,010 --> 01:56:59,530
Guys, this is hard.

2739
01:57:00,350 --> 01:57:01,450
Guys, this is hard.

2740
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:06,050
I think they just killed somebody.

2741
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:06,890
I think.

2742
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:09,310
Wait.

2743
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:10,290
What the?

2744
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:16,450
Oh wait.

2745
01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:17,370
Oh my...

2746
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:21,800
Hello, Doki.

2747
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:26,100
Where's my person?

2748
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:29,300
Oh my God.

2749
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:29,940
I said the judge.

2750
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,400
Oh my gosh.

2751
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:37,500
Do we not do it here?

2752
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:43,420
Guys,

2753
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:48,090
this is scary.

2754
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,630
I don't like actually being this.

2755
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:50,350
Oh my God.

2756
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:51,790
Oh.

2757
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:53,270
I don't like it.

2758
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:55,550
What the hell is this?

2759
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:58,230
What's happening?

2760
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:02,790
What the hell is that?

2761
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,060
Oh my gosh, I see like...

2762
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:16,260
Oh my gosh.

2763
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:17,340
Wait.

2764
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,760
Cannot judge until the next day.

2765
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,880
Oh, I can do this though.

2766
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:22,420
Oh, okay.

2767
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:22,480
Okay.

2768
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,060
Can I do like command cards or anything though?

2769
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,360
Hello?

2770
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:34,040
Why aren't you talking to me?

2771
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:35,760
You sus?

2772
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:37,560
Hello?

2773
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,780
Wait, Snuffy is...

2774
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:42,880
Snuffy is arrested.

2775
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:44,220
Hello?

2776
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:46,140
I can't hear anybody.

2777
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:47,720
Hello?

2778
01:58:51,050 --> 01:58:51,690
Hello?

2779
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:52,950
I can't hear you.

2780
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:54,890
Stay away from me.

2781
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:55,990
I can't hear you.

2782
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:57,100
I can't hear...

2783
01:58:58,190 --> 01:58:58,770
Hello?

2784
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:03,150
Oh, who is it?

2785
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:04,100
I got mugged.

2786
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:11,880
This is so funny.

2787
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,620
This is so funny.

2788
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,440
This is so slow motion.

2789
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,760
I love just being deaf and like just harassing the person I'm trying to.

2790
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:24,120
Oh my God.

2791
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:25,060
So bad.

2792
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:26,820
Lime and Bao.

2793
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,760
Okay, I'm just wondering this time for sure.

2794
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,940
You guys can hear me now, right?

2795
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:31,640
Yeah.

2796
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:34,340
So, new update on this.

2797
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,620
I can't hear anybody, but I can actually hear all the people who are dead.

2798
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
But they can't hear me.

2799
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,920
Wait, Doki, were you talking to me?

2800
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,060
Yeah, yeah.

2801
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:43,380
I think the mic bugged out.

2802
01:59:43,380 --> 01:59:44,140
I think it bugged.

2803
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,080
I couldn't hear you.

2804
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:47,280
Oh my God.

2805
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:52,080
I found Limu's dead body and her notebook had mint only circled.

2806
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:56,240
I can perform a seance with the dead.

2807
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:57,480
Guys, just listen to me.

2808
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:03,980
What did the dead say, Snuffy?

2809
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:04,960
What did he tell you?

2810
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:06,400
Guys, who killed you?

2811
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:07,280
Let me know.

2812
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:11,600
What is she saying?

2813
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:14,520
Hello?

2814
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:18,120
You couldn't say.

2815
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:18,860
I couldn't hear you.

2816
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:19,380
Hello?

2817
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:22,680
What is that?

2818
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:23,060
Hello?

2819
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:30,340
By the words, he asked her why she was like, it's Snuffy in the end.

2820
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,240
I like how Snuffy is legend, legend.

2821
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:34,600
FBI, FBI.

2822
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:35,980
What are these titles?

2823
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:38,680
Open up, FBI, FBI.

2824
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:40,560
That's me.

2825
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:47,160
I found a try to... Sorry, Mint, but in the beginning, I was next to you and my ID card was stolen.

2826
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:49,700
And then now, Lime had your name circled.

2827
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:51,000
So it makes me think it's you.

2828
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,040
I was doing... I was investigating you.

2829
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:54,020
I had a mission.

2830
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:56,560
It was just to investigate you.

2831
02:00:58,020 --> 02:00:58,980
That's suspicious.

2832
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:00,940
Here's the thing.

2833
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:07,460
When I talked to an NPC like last round who was like, oh yeah, well in this area, someone was seen at night opening a book.

2834
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:13,240
It had just turned to night time like 20 seconds before and only Mint was in that area.

2835
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,680
Well, it could have been you too.

2836
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,180
What do you mean by that?

2837
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:21,020
You wouldn't have talked to that guy if it was me.

2838
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:23,640
You could be making that up.

2839
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:24,120
I know.

2840
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:27,360
I talked to the people too and they say things.

2841
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:28,740
She's stumbling.

2842
02:01:28,860 --> 02:01:29,680
She's panicking.

2843
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,820
Kira would never panic.

2844
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:36,200
Long live Kira!

2845
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:38,200
Long live Kira!

2846
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:43,020
I actually can't tell who's dead and who's alive.

2847
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:45,880
So if I'm responding to people you can't even hear, I'm so sorry.

2848
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:49,460
I'm talking to my imaginary friend.

2849
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:54,140
Yeah, communicate with the dead.

2850
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,940
What do they have to say about Mint?

2851
02:01:57,940 --> 02:01:58,620
I'm innocent!

2852
02:01:59,200 --> 02:01:59,840
I'm innocent!

2853
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,560
You said long live Kira.

2854
02:02:03,220 --> 02:02:05,000
I mean, I'm a follower.

2855
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:11,800
I should have given the notebook to you Snuffy, goddammit.

2856
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:21,120
I'm inexperienced, don't blame me!

2857
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:26,860
I believe the person's name, whose shirt is literally saying Kira.

2858
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:35,160
It's a prop, it's for a movie, we're making a live action Death Note.

2859
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:39,100
Oh my god, you're making Death Note 2 on Netflix?

2860
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:39,840
Yeah.

2861
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,640
Oh my god, I'm locked up forever.

2862
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:44,960
You're looking a little goofy.

2863
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:50,980
Good job.

2864
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,580
There's always the one you least suspect.

2865
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,620
I got kinda far-ish.

2866
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,600
I'm just glad I got to live and harass you guys.

2867
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:04,460
Why Moo, why did you have to play the game and circle my name?

2868
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:09,300
Oh my god.

2869
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,360
Her final message.

2870
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:13,100
Mint.

2871
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:16,880
I wonder what a circle around Mint's name could mean.

2872
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:17,720
I don't know.

2873
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,020
I'm sorry Mint.

2874
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:21,220
Live Moo was actually playing the game.

2875
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,700
I need to okay all of you.

2876
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:24,720
Circle people's names?

2877
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:26,720
Yeah, that's what the notebook is for.

2878
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:27,480
That's what it's for.

2879
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:32,260
To be fair, I've been Kira like 99% of the time.

2880
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:33,500
Wait a minute.

2881
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:35,520
Oh, well this is awkward.

2882
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,700
I'm gonna change my role preference.

2883
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,680
Too many chefs.

2884
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,400
Oh, I can be a chef too.

2885
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:44,540
Too many chefs.

2886
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:48,820
Oh wait, I like how we're all getting the same stuff at the same time.

2887
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,780
So everyone ends up wearing the same shit.

2888
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:52,240
Not me, I'm an individual.

2889
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:54,080
I picked a bow instead.

2890
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:54,760
I picked those.

2891
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:56,440
Trying to make myself look atrocious.

2892
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:59,360
Look at my cute little bow.

2893
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:00,300
I'm adorable.

2894
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:02,900
I took a shower.

2895
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:05,860
I like how Snuffy is the only one that took the shower cap.

2896
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:07,300
I took the shower.

2897
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:08,680
We're buddies.

2898
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:12,860
But I paid for the afro, so I have to use it.

2899
02:04:14,980 --> 02:04:15,420
Alright, alright.

2900
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:20,320
You know when Gaia online, when people were fangirling over L?

2901
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:21,580
This is how they drew him.

2902
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:24,300
Just with a cute little bow and pretty glasses.

2903
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:25,000
So cute!

2904
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:27,240
Oh my god, he even had the roundest headroom.

2905
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:27,780
You're so cute.

2906
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:28,540
So cute!

2907
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:30,840
Baby girl L.

2908
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:31,980
Baby girl.

2909
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,270
Ugly ass stupid bull G.I.

2910
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:42,260
An L, a Q, a near, a mellow, or a matte fan?

2911
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:46,100
Alright, I'm upping my mellow fan.

2912
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:50,520
Which one?

2913
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:51,980
What was your favorite fella?

2914
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:54,660
Mosquito.

2915
02:04:58,340 --> 02:04:59,040
Mosquito?

2916
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:01,340
You're not here?

2917
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,300
Am I the only one hearing the buzz?

2918
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:06,040
Oh no.

2919
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:09,540
Alright, I made it so that tasks go by faster now.

2920
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:13,280
Alright, let's see if it does work though.

2921
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:15,140
It definitely won't for me.

2922
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:15,840
Good luck everybody.

2923
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:26,860
Sorry guys, this is my dinner.

2924
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:29,460
And also my breakfast, so I'm really hungry.

2925
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:32,760
Oh god.

2926
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:38,540
Grimmy?

2927
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:51,340
What were you saying no about?

2928
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,660
What was that about?

2929
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:58,980
Oh mask?

2930
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:01,100
I'm blowing air, literally.

2931
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:03,740
I'm just spreading all my germs in all directions.

2932
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:11,740
Okay.

2933
02:06:15,220 --> 02:06:17,380
I just wanna keep eating my sandwich, I'm not gonna lie.

2934
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,340
Oh, I'm supposed to keep distance?

2935
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,060
Grimmy's pretty sus, I'm gonna say.

2936
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:26,050
Grimmy's pretty sus.

2937
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,640
Two people.

2938
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:32,460
Two people came by today.

2939
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,900
Two of them.

2940
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:40,780
Oh shoot, it's already night.

2941
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:41,800
Oh, what's happening?

2942
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:44,360
Death note test.

2943
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:52,420
In here?

2944
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,640
I'm resolving.

2945
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:54,740
I'm resolving.

2946
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:58,180
It says only two people are resolving.

2947
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:01,140
I'm resolving.

2948
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:04,760
More resolving.

2949
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:06,680
Four of us.

2950
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:10,980
Okay, slime on Juniper.

2951
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:16,420
Yeah, I did.

2952
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:18,780
Is it in here?

2953
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:19,840
No.

2954
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,420
Wait, can I get this person though?

2955
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:23,940
Oh, I have to talk to this person.

2956
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:26,860
Five people came by today.

2957
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,480
Oh no, it's the other direction.

2958
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,920
Spread your germs.

2959
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:38,750
Who am I investigating?

2960
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:40,690
Limel!

2961
02:07:43,730 --> 02:07:45,930
Limel, can I follow you respectfully?

2962
02:07:46,710 --> 02:07:47,230
Okay, thank you.

2963
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:52,310
Oh wait, the person I'm investigating is in here.

2964
02:07:58,050 --> 02:08:00,230
Someone was talking on the transceiver during the day.

2965
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:00,670
The park.

2966
02:08:01,350 --> 02:08:02,050
What's the transceiver?

2967
02:08:02,110 --> 02:08:02,990
How do you use the transceiver?

2968
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:07,990
Oh yeah, you guys did the same thing.

2969
02:08:09,150 --> 02:08:10,950
In the park, during the day?

2970
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:12,170
Where's the park?

2971
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:14,650
Park is this way.

2972
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:17,570
I completed all my tasks.

2973
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:22,850
Who's that over there?

2974
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:24,990
They look suspicious.

2975
02:08:24,990 --> 02:08:27,090
Oh my god!

2976
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:43,690
Everybody takes out Limel first because she's so powerful.

2977
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:48,050
Dude, this happens to her every game.

2978
02:08:48,050 --> 02:08:51,490
If she's not the first to be a killer, she's the first to die.

2979
02:08:51,730 --> 02:08:56,250
When it was my turn, I actively avoided killing her so she could keep playing the game.

2980
02:09:01,890 --> 02:09:03,450
There's other choices.

2981
02:09:03,770 --> 02:09:07,970
There was gun, chandelier, all that shit, but they picked the truck.

2982
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:10,210
That's their signature.

2983
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,970
That's just their signature.

2984
02:09:13,890 --> 02:09:15,650
Limel, can I still hear you?

2985
02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:18,210
I don't think I can.

2986
02:09:18,410 --> 02:09:19,090
Oh, I can.

2987
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:20,950
What is she saying?

2988
02:09:21,530 --> 02:09:22,390
What is Limel saying?

2989
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,370
It's none of your business.

2990
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:25,590
Only I get to talk to her.

2991
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:28,610
I think it's Doki.

2992
02:09:29,630 --> 02:09:31,710
How did you know that they could have picked anything?

2993
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:34,850
Because I was Kira before.

2994
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,690
Yeah, but you didn't kill anyone.

2995
02:09:37,170 --> 02:09:38,670
We didn't kill anyone as Kira.

2996
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:44,950
You didn't kill anyone before as Kira.

2997
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:47,310
I think Doki stole it.

2998
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:48,190
I think Doki stole it.

2999
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:53,530
Doki got really close to me and then did nothing about it and just turned around and didn't go anywhere.

3000
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:55,410
And she just wanted to get really close to me.

3001
02:09:55,530 --> 02:09:57,090
What do you mean?

3002
02:09:57,190 --> 02:09:58,450
I was doing the fucking best thing.

3003
02:09:59,130 --> 02:10:02,850
I have a really good sense of smell that I have lost my sense of smell.

3004
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:05,190
So I can smell the fuss on you.

3005
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:09,190
But you know what they say, when you lose one of your senses...

3006
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:14,550
You said Doki, when you were the killer last time, you immediately gave it to someone else.

3007
02:10:15,890 --> 02:10:16,990
That is true.

3008
02:10:17,190 --> 02:10:18,510
You didn't kill anyone before.

3009
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:24,930
Two people, Snuffy and someone else, and then I gave the book to somebody else.

3010
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:26,070
All they call me is...

3011
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:29,130
You're going to be so surprised when it's not me.

3012
02:10:33,450 --> 02:10:36,830
She's starting to lag, so she's definitely what Kira would do.

3013
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:41,330
Do it.

3014
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:42,050
Arrest me.

3015
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:44,090
Okay, it has to be her, right?

3016
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:44,970
Why is she cutting out?

3017
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:51,670
Go to jail.

3018
02:10:56,110 --> 02:11:01,150
Wait, why is Grimmie voting for Amelie?

3019
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:05,030
Undo, undo, undo.

3020
02:11:05,550 --> 02:11:07,050
Wait, why is it Amelie?

3021
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:08,910
She's kind of a freak.

3022
02:11:09,070 --> 02:11:11,710
Let's put Amelie in the jail cell instead.

3023
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:13,200
Someone handcuffed me.

3024
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:16,070
Someone handcuffed me to somebody.

3025
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:18,590
And then my ID was gone.

3026
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:22,070
And now she's going, it has to be Doki, it has to be Doki.

3027
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:23,550
I'm sure it's Amelie.

3028
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:28,510
Amelie was right next to where Laimu died, actually.

3029
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:31,710
I was right, I almost got hit by the car.

3030
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:33,650
It missed me by a millimeter.

3031
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:34,230
What was that?

3032
02:11:35,650 --> 02:11:36,570
Did we have to select someone?

3033
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:39,430
I think someone applied a little funny thing when you vote someone else.

3034
02:11:40,350 --> 02:11:42,710
Wait, who am I going to vote next to, Doki?

3035
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:46,190
What if I'm into that snuffy?

3036
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:47,010
That's right.

3037
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:48,930
Oh no.

3038
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:50,710
New world investigator.

3039
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:52,170
Oh no!

3040
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:54,930
It's...

3041
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:57,350
Ok, now you can start barking for me.

3042
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:59,030
Let me poke you around all game.

3043
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:05,310
It's Amelie, it's Amelie, it's Amelie.

3044
02:12:05,350 --> 02:12:06,390
I think it's Amelie too.

3045
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:08,550
I think it's also Amelie.

3046
02:12:10,150 --> 02:12:12,350
Wait, we gotta tell L then.

3047
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:12,770
Hey!

3048
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:13,610
Oh my God.

3049
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:16,470
No, Vienna, no!

3050
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:18,370
Vienna, don't let her!

3051
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:19,790
Don't let her, Vienna!

3052
02:12:22,590 --> 02:12:23,890
Oh my God.

3053
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:26,610
I must investigate you.

3054
02:12:26,610 --> 02:12:40,030
I think it is Amelie.

3055
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:46,850
What the hell is this?

3056
02:12:47,390 --> 02:12:48,430
You just have Doki.

3057
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:59,320
Oh my God.

3058
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:04,180
Hey, stay away from me!

3059
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:12,930
It's Amelie, it's Amelie.

3060
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:13,870
We gotta get her.

3061
02:13:17,950 --> 02:13:19,590
5 people resolving?

3062
02:13:19,890 --> 02:13:20,130
Ok.

3063
02:13:20,990 --> 02:13:22,230
That's a lot of resolvers.

3064
02:13:22,230 --> 02:13:23,430
That's a lot of resolvers.

3065
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:24,970
Oh gosh, all of us are in trouble.

3066
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:27,330
It's Amelie!

3067
02:13:27,630 --> 02:13:28,970
You guys have to believe me!

3068
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:29,590
It's Amelie!

3069
02:13:29,770 --> 02:13:31,130
I got Limu's book!

3070
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:32,470
I got Limu's book!

3071
02:13:34,450 --> 02:13:36,550
Because all she did was...

3072
02:13:37,990 --> 02:13:42,610
Limu was only in contact with Bao and Amelie.

3073
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:46,110
And Amelie is so sus.

3074
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:59,090
Wait, how do I get around here?

3075
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,670
I wish there was a back door, man.

3076
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:04,470
There is a little red word next to the bear name now.

3077
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:06,010
Drive by investigation?

3078
02:14:06,450 --> 02:14:07,170
Thank you.

3079
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:08,070
I

3080
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:15,120
don't think it's Bao.

3081
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:22,100
Doki, you are like a fucking dog.

3082
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:25,480
Oh my God.

3083
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:27,960
What happened?

3084
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:27,960
What?

3085
02:14:28,540 --> 02:14:28,840
Who?

3086
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:41,220
You knew!

3087
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:42,960
We were too late!

3088
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:44,660
We were too late!

3089
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,960
Sorry Grimmy, I tried to spread your gospel.

3090
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:55,960
Ok,

3091
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:02,300
but I was right about Doki.

3092
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,600
I was right about Doki.

3093
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,280
Wait a second, I gave away my IDs before.

3094
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,720
She passed off the book, didn't she?

3095
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:17,440
I was just giving her all the IDs.

3096
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:22,460
But I had no IDs so I could live.

3097
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:26,200
This is actually more fun when you like kind of get the idea of the game.

3098
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3099
02:15:28,060 --> 02:15:29,420
Can we play another one?

3100
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,220
I'm gonna try.

3101
02:15:30,220 --> 02:15:31,800
I don't know.

3102
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:34,080
I tried doing that before and it didn't work.

3103
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:34,720
So I don't know.

3104
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:35,720
I don't know.

3105
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:40,320
No, because I can still hear everybody.

3106
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:41,520
Like right now I can hear everybody.

3107
02:15:41,740 --> 02:15:43,440
It's literally only when the game plays.

3108
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:45,260
I didn't see a setting that's like...

3109
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:45,700
That's so weird.

3110
02:15:46,060 --> 02:15:46,340
Everybody.

3111
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:49,980
And like I can hear Limes but she can't hear me and she's also dead and I'm not.

3112
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:50,780
That's weird.

3113
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:51,520
That's so weird.

3114
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:53,400
Like day one bug maybe.

3115
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:54,640
Maybe.

3116
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:57,700
Alright, let's see.

3117
02:15:58,180 --> 02:15:59,700
Oh my god, there's...

3118
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:05,820
As long as Snuffy can still hear me, I'm gonna like annoy the shit out of her every time I die, I guess.

3119
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:07,740
She's like the seance.

3120
02:16:11,660 --> 02:16:13,620
Lime, what is Lime saying?

3121
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:15,840
Snuffy, tell us her final words.

3122
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:16,740
What is it?

3123
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:21,900
Are we all here?

3124
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:22,860
We're missing one person.

3125
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:24,140
I think...

3126
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:25,660
Didn't Snuffy leave to try and rejoin?

3127
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:26,100
Oh, Snuffy.

3128
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:27,020
Oh yeah, he said Snuffy.

3129
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:28,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3130
02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:31,020
Snuffy's trying to fix it.

3131
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:32,800
We're slowly understanding the game now.

3132
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:33,200
Yeah.

3133
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:35,540
We have different maps in the future.

3134
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:41,640
Yeah, and like different tasks to do rather than just talk to people and stalk people.

3135
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:43,520
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

3136
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:49,100
To be fair, this game came out so fucking fast so I feel like they were like, gotta drop it now.

3137
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,160
For what reason?

3138
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:51,800
I don't understand.

3139
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:53,640
It needs a little bit of like cleaning up.

3140
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:54,040
Yeah.

3141
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:55,540
I like the ideas of it.

3142
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3143
02:16:57,140 --> 02:16:58,200
It's another alternative.

3144
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:00,040
Yeah, that's fun.

3145
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,400
The Among Us, there's no alternative.

3146
02:17:02,740 --> 02:17:07,640
It makes you think and like, suspect people in different ways because of the notebooks and stuff.

3147
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:08,120
It's fun.

3148
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,440
Yeah, you gotta like, look everywhere.

3149
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,960
I'm like, why are you so close to me?

3150
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,040
Yeah.

3151
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:16,020
Why are you so close to me?

3152
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:17,260
I don't like every little thing that gets stuck.

3153
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:17,740
Yeah, yeah.

3154
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:18,480
Back up!

3155
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:19,500
I also like the music.

3156
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:20,660
I think the music is good.

3157
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:22,660
Yeah, she looks like...

3158
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:27,540
We're supposed to practice COVID protocols here.

3159
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:28,800
Why are you guys all so close?

3160
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:31,040
Mask up, mask up, mask up, mask up.

3161
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,040
Six feet, mask up, mask up.

3162
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:32,680
Guys, guys, guys.

3163
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:35,280
Only one person here is wearing a mask, right?

3164
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:37,000
Two people are wearing masks.

3165
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,040
I'm spreading my germs in all directions.

3166
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:43,020
I'm literally blowing out into the world.

3167
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:44,560
I'm kind of sneezing right now.

3168
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:46,460
I wonder who gave it to me.

3169
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:49,940
Alright, Snuffy, can you hear us?

3170
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:51,100
Yes.

3171
02:17:51,480 --> 02:17:52,660
I'm beyond brave.

3172
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:54,520
But I'm starting the game.

3173
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,820
We'll have to see in the game.

3174
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:59,060
If someone's next to Snuffy, confirm.

3175
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:01,500
Okay, hoping for you.

3176
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:03,640
We hope.

3177
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:06,060
Of course.

3178
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:07,480
I wanna be L now.

3179
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:08,940
I wanna at least be L.

3180
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,520
I wanna be L.

3181
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:11,720
I want to be L.

3182
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:13,960
When will I be L?

3183
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:15,480
Snuffy?

3184
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:21,940
Who's next to me?

3185
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:26,500
Hello, Giga?

3186
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:29,860
Wait, why can't I move?

3187
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:30,960
Oh, there we go.

3188
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:32,080
I'm good.

3189
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:35,380
Snuffy?

3190
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:38,600
I can hear you.

3191
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,120
Okay, good.

3192
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:46,600
And I'm investigating in this little parking lot.

3193
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:51,020
I'm gonna go question some NPCs.

3194
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:53,000
This looks like an Oreo, doesn't it?

3195
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:56,700
I have some Oreos in my pantry.

3196
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:00,820
I'm gonna eat an Oreo after this.

3197
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,440
Two people.

3198
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:06,560
Oh, there they were.

3199
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:07,500
Who was that?

3200
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:08,940
Amelie and Snuffy?

3201
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:15,700
Hello, Amelie?

3202
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:17,680
Hi.

3203
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,380
Oreo-thins?

3204
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:24,600
I've never had an Oreo-thin.

3205
02:19:26,020 --> 02:19:26,800
Oh, oh my goodness.

3206
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:32,560
I'm literally monitoring nothing.

3207
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:33,560
Doing nothing.

3208
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,220
I'm not supposed to, I'm not supposed to...

3209
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:42,580
Oh my gosh.

3210
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:43,440
Wait.

3211
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:47,900
How do we... Where's the dead body?

3212
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:56,360
Oh my God, there's so many people in here.

3213
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:10,000
Ah, they're a freak then.

3214
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:11,120
Whoever they are.

3215
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:12,720
Uh oh, this way maybe?

3216
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:16,140
Yes, let's go, Snuffy.

3217
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:19,000
I trust you.

3218
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:22,800
Okay, we're here to help.

3219
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,340
Oh, we failed.

3220
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:30,260
Oh gosh.

3221
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:33,280
Oh, so sad.

3222
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:33,860
Okay.

3223
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:37,680
Yeah.

3224
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:39,400
Where'd you guys go?

3225
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:48,900
Oh my God, oh my God, I'm trying to... Oh my God, I think I got stolen.

3226
02:20:49,060 --> 02:20:50,500
I got stolen from, maybe.

3227
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:55,240
No, if it says it just means you've been in close enough proximity to get it stolen.

3228
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:56,160
If that makes sense.

3229
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:58,760
Yeah, but it could have been stolen by you.

3230
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:00,620
Oh wait, Laimo, I have an item for you.

3231
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:01,920
Laimo?

3232
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:11,100
What do I do?

3233
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:13,140
Oh, what do I do with this?

3234
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:15,940
Okay.

3235
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:16,000
Okay.

3236
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:18,640
I actually don't really know.

3237
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,960
Oh, investigator Amelie.

3238
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:22,460
Save, Amelie's safe.

3239
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:22,780
No!

3240
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:25,420
What?

3241
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,020
Someone in my chat literally just said Amelie's sus.

3242
02:21:30,220 --> 02:21:30,380
No.

3243
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:33,240
No.

3244
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:36,220
Well, Amelie just gets a pass now.

3245
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:37,680
It just says she was an investigator.

3246
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:39,180
I trust that.

3247
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:41,340
Wow.

3248
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:42,820
Alright.

3249
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:42,900
Alright.

3250
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:47,160
Nothing happened.

3251
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,640
Nobody's dead.

3252
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:55,240
That's weird that nobody did anything.

3253
02:21:56,020 --> 02:21:58,200
Yeah, that's a little suspicious.

3254
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,380
They don't want us to know just yet.

3255
02:22:02,380 --> 02:22:02,940
Not me.

3256
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:04,420
That was me.

3257
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:05,580
They're playing the long game.

3258
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:07,420
I'm someone not very good at Aira.

3259
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:08,840
Might be it.

3260
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:11,360
Whoa, and who do you...

3261
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,440
That's crazy.

3262
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:14,200
You stole my ID, though.

3263
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:15,600
What the fuck?

3264
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:17,700
I don't even have my own ID.

3265
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:19,280
I think it's Val.

3266
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:20,900
Wait, no one's ID was stolen?

3267
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:22,180
Mine was.

3268
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:23,100
Oh, okay, just kidding.

3269
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:24,720
It is literally not me.

3270
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:28,420
I have been doing all my investigations and talking to every single NPC.

3271
02:22:28,880 --> 02:22:33,140
I went to every single investigation when a body died except the last one because I got lost.

3272
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:38,500
The only people that I don't suspect right now is Giga, Doki, and Amelie.

3273
02:22:38,780 --> 02:22:39,760
And Minto.

3274
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:43,560
The only people who didn't come close enough to me to steal my identity but the rest of you.

3275
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:45,340
Snuffy, Snuffy, I wasn't right next to it.

3276
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:47,020
Minto's so suspicious of me.

3277
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:51,300
I think it's Doki because I was next to Doki and my card got stolen, I think.

3278
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,940
We also failed.

3279
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:55,440
I said my card got stolen.

3280
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:57,240
I was like, holy shit, how did she do that?

3281
02:22:57,980 --> 02:23:00,360
Did you guys see anybody whacking off?

3282
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:02,020
You were what?

3283
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:03,040
By the body?

3284
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:03,720
You were whacking off?

3285
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:04,920
Whacking off by the body?

3286
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:07,220
No, you were next to it.

3287
02:23:07,220 --> 02:23:08,960
You guys, she was just sitting on the cameras.

3288
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:10,560
I was talking about the camera case.

3289
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:13,180
Why did we put webcams in the toilet?

3290
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,980
Fira was not jorking his penis.

3291
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:19,300
How would you know that, investigator?

3292
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:22,220
How do you know that?

3293
02:23:23,140 --> 02:23:24,920
I wasn't watching.

3294
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,200
Right, right.

3295
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:29,700
We're getting a little off topic here.

3296
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,800
I vote out.

3297
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:36,140
That there's something up with Limu.

3298
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:38,440
Limu's been very quiet.

3299
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:41,420
Limu has been very quiet.

3300
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:43,080
We've had no drunk drivers today.

3301
02:23:44,360 --> 02:23:46,160
Limu hasn't been over yet.

3302
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:46,920
What the fuck?

3303
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:49,980
Limu is a liar.

3304
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:51,100
It has to be her.

3305
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:53,060
Let me see your licenses, everyone.

3306
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:54,020
Wait, how do I...

3307
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:55,560
License.

3308
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:57,460
Alright, Limu.

3309
02:23:58,300 --> 02:24:00,420
It's a little suspicious that you're still alive.

3310
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:02,300
A little weird.

3311
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:03,780
We'll keep that in mind.

3312
02:24:05,940 --> 02:24:10,140
Do you think it's a little sus how accusatory some people are being?

3313
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:11,460
Yeah, I think so.

3314
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:13,220
I think it could be a little sussy.

3315
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:14,800
Yeah, it's a lot.

3316
02:24:15,940 --> 02:24:16,880
Just a thought.

3317
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,160
Much to think about.

3318
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:25,040
I'm gonna go monitor Riena.

3319
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:27,700
Riena, please, I'm monitoring you.

3320
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:28,420
Thank you, I'm sorry.

3321
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:30,160
I'm monitoring you.

3322
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:35,940
OK, I have a little person.

3323
02:24:38,660 --> 02:24:39,480
Perhaps Doki?

3324
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:44,640
God, it really is on my side.

3325
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:45,340
Oh my gosh.

3326
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:46,200
Shoot.

3327
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:48,640
No one's been here.

3328
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:49,640
OK, I'm here though.

3329
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:50,480
I lived!

3330
02:24:51,060 --> 02:24:51,600
I lived!

3331
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:53,360
What do you mean you lived?

3332
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:55,320
What do you mean you lived?

3333
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:58,380
We got hit by a car, but we're OK.

3334
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,420
Were you like shoved into here?

3335
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,420
Oh, that's happened to me.

3336
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:03,680
It happened to me in the tutorial, yeah.

3337
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:08,480
OK, three people resolving.

3338
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:09,860
Where's everybody else?

3339
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:13,920
Oh, that means one of us is not resolving.

3340
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:14,740
I was resolving.

3341
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:15,840
I was resolving.

3342
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:17,940
Otherwise I would have not known that number.

3343
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:18,280
We're resolving?

3344
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:18,900
We're resolving?

3345
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:21,020
So this bus didn't actually kill anyone?

3346
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:22,940
No, it just killed Kira.

3347
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:27,140
It prevents the new god from... like the new world order.

3348
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:29,860
Wait, who just said I'm Kira?

3349
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:37,680
It was you!

3350
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:40,180
It was you, Doki, was it not?

3351
02:25:40,820 --> 02:25:41,680
No, it wasn't.

3352
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:42,460
What the fuck?

3353
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:43,240
I was investigating.

3354
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:46,260
No, I think it was you who said I'm Kira.

3355
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:47,160
No, I would never.

3356
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:48,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3357
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:50,480
Yeah, typical Kira.

3358
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:51,660
Oh, wait, I'm going in here.

3359
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:53,100
Hey, stop stealing my stuff.

3360
02:25:55,220 --> 02:25:56,100
Oh, hello?

3361
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:57,120
Hey, hey!

3362
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:58,080
Who could be Kira?

3363
02:25:58,400 --> 02:25:58,680
Wait.

3364
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:00,080
Cafe.

3365
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,160
Wait, where is that?

3366
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:05,300
Oh my gosh, I still have more.

3367
02:26:05,540 --> 02:26:06,380
Oh my gosh, and who?

3368
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:07,420
I'm monitoring Grimmy.

3369
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:13,920
Who was that?

3370
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:14,880
Who was what?

3371
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:18,760
Circle Doki's name.

3372
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:20,280
Oh, dang it.

3373
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:23,020
Set up surveillance.

3374
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:33,240
I'm grabbing it.

3375
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:35,520
Someone... Hey!

3376
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:36,880
Stay away.

3377
02:26:37,640 --> 02:26:38,940
Oh, I need to go down here?

3378
02:26:39,060 --> 02:26:39,540
Oh my gosh.

3379
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:43,300
That in here?

3380
02:26:43,940 --> 02:26:44,640
Okay, here we go.

3381
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:46,540
I did it.

3382
02:26:46,940 --> 02:26:47,600
I did my part.

3383
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:51,360
Okay, I need to do my other tasks.

3384
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:52,600
Never mind, we have 10 seconds.

3385
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:56,740
This is... The tasks are...

3386
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,960
Tricky to do sometimes.

3387
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:58,820
Oh, there's Grimmy!

3388
02:27:02,140 --> 02:27:03,420
Who was near me?

3389
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:04,620
Juniper was near me?

3390
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:05,060
No.

3391
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:07,160
Don't do that.

3392
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:08,540
We can be civil.

3393
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,460
I like how that's a huge threat.

3394
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:12,900
I'm gonna post your name on the internet.

3395
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:15,020
Oh my God!

3396
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:16,740
Oh my God!

3397
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:21,960
Two.

3398
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:24,960
We know Amelie was proven innocent.

3399
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:30,380
Vienna, you know what to do.

3400
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:31,680
Okay, okay.

3401
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:33,480
So, what does that mean?

3402
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:36,940
Giga and Mint were walking together and Mint said I have to investigate you.

3403
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,580
But Mint didn't actually stand close enough to me to investigate me.

3404
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:41,600
But Giga did and said she also had to investigate me.

3405
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:41,800
What?

3406
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:44,160
What are the chances they both had to investigate me and were together?

3407
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:45,780
And Mint didn't complete her investigation.

3408
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:46,160
What?

3409
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:47,640
I did complete my investigation.

3410
02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:48,840
I was close enough.

3411
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:51,200
What do you mean I wasn't close enough?

3412
02:27:51,260 --> 02:27:52,240
I did my investigation.

3413
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:54,220
Time the thing off for me.

3414
02:27:57,720 --> 02:27:58,900
Who was it?

3415
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:03,060
Wait, who was it though?

3416
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:06,820
Her internet might have gone out again.

3417
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:11,560
That was a really good game so far though.

3418
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:13,380
I was eating that shit up.

3419
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:15,920
That was drama.

3420
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:17,820
That was some drama.

3421
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:18,360
Oh my God.

3422
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:20,220
So who was the killer?

3423
02:28:20,220 --> 02:28:20,660
Who was it?

3424
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:22,520
It was me and Limo.

3425
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:26,440
Giga, I trusted you!

3426
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:28,480
That's the real strategy of Limo.

3427
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:29,920
Giga, I trusted you!

3428
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:34,780
Limo, did it freak you the fuck out when I instantly voted for you?

3429
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:41,020
I went to tell Doki that I thought it was Giga and she got hit by the car in front of me.

3430
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:44,600
She was too sus of me at one point.

3431
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:46,700
Dude, I just got hella good at this conversation.

3432
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:52,060
I knew it couldn't have been anyone else in that room where we were looking at the body, but Limo was also there.

3433
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:53,640
I feel so bad.

3434
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:57,460
I saw Grimmy in an alleyway and was instantly like, Grimmy must be it.

3435
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:00,360
Hey bro, welcome back!

3436
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:02,740
Welcome back!

3437
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:03,820
Yay!

3438
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:05,240
What happened?

3439
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:06,220
Who was Kira?

3440
02:29:07,420 --> 02:29:08,940
It was me and Limo.

3441
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:13,320
Okay, I didn't know you.

3442
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:15,100
I know, I just didn't.

3443
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:17,100
Giga, we were buddies.

3444
02:29:17,900 --> 02:29:19,680
Giga was like, rising me up.

3445
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:22,660
She was like, do you think everybody is being a little too accusatory?

3446
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,100
And I was like, yeah, I think so, yeah.

3447
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:28,140
I was marinating so hard, dude.

3448
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:31,420
I was like, yeah, I trust you.

3449
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,740
I was just like, oh my god.

3450
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,020
First mistake.

3451
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:38,980
Trust nobody, not even yourself.

3452
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,400
If Limo lives past first round, we know.

3453
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:43,780
It's true.

3454
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:48,720
Alright, let's go.

3455
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:54,220
I want to be L.

3456
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,480
Why can't I be L?

3457
02:30:04,270 --> 02:30:08,290
Take this potato chip and I'll eat it.

3458
02:30:08,290 --> 02:30:09,070
Oh.

3459
02:30:12,810 --> 02:30:15,330
Sus, that's really strange of you.

3460
02:30:15,550 --> 02:30:16,670
Actually, Bao, can you come here?

3461
02:30:16,710 --> 02:30:17,830
I got to investigate you real quick.

3462
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:19,830
Thank you.

3463
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:21,750
Take a note.

3464
02:30:23,630 --> 02:30:24,510
No, maybe.

3465
02:30:24,770 --> 02:30:25,090
I don't know.

3466
02:30:26,650 --> 02:30:27,990
I'm a part time thief.

3467
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:29,470
You know?

3468
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:32,310
Nobody's been here.

3469
02:30:39,990 --> 02:30:40,330
Excuse me.

3470
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:43,330
Oh, mine's in here.

3471
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:43,990
Just kidding.

3472
02:30:49,150 --> 02:30:50,710
Five people, holy moly.

3473
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:58,150
I'm chilling here.

3474
02:30:58,290 --> 02:30:59,090
Grimmy, what are you doing?

3475
02:30:59,770 --> 02:31:00,710
You want to sit on the bench here?

3476
02:31:05,450 --> 02:31:06,790
It's a pleasant day, right?

3477
02:31:09,710 --> 02:31:11,550
Oh, Juniper, I got to investigate you.

3478
02:31:12,370 --> 02:31:12,890
Thank you.

3479
02:31:13,890 --> 02:31:15,310
You were really willing about that.

3480
02:31:15,410 --> 02:31:16,990
Were you taking my ID when I did that?

3481
02:31:20,890 --> 02:31:22,870
I just got a job to do, you know?

3482
02:31:23,410 --> 02:31:24,670
And you do too if you're a killer.

3483
02:31:25,050 --> 02:31:26,330
I'll remember that.

3484
02:31:35,490 --> 02:31:38,170
I'm going to turn the volume up a little bit more.

3485
02:31:38,170 --> 02:31:39,110
Please cooperate.

3486
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:44,330
No one's been here.

3487
02:31:44,770 --> 02:31:45,450
Wait, in here?

3488
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:49,310
OK, Juniper is safe.

3489
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:49,810
Nevermind.

3490
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:54,670
What about you, Amelie?

3491
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:56,330
Are you taking my... Are you going to take it?

3492
02:31:56,650 --> 02:31:57,390
Are you going to take my thing?

3493
02:31:58,290 --> 02:31:58,510
OK.

3494
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:02,630
Transceiver.

3495
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:04,230
Hey!

3496
02:32:06,010 --> 02:32:06,490
Hello.

3497
02:32:06,490 --> 02:32:06,630
Hello.

3498
02:32:08,130 --> 02:32:10,470
Yeah, me too.

3499
02:32:12,190 --> 02:32:14,350
Do you need... Do you need to monitor me?

3500
02:32:14,770 --> 02:32:16,630
No, I'm just... I'm just following.

3501
02:32:18,250 --> 02:32:20,270
I wish you could mark who you think it's not.

3502
02:32:20,510 --> 02:32:21,210
That would be awesome.

3503
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:22,470
Oh, yeah.

3504
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:26,930
Yeah, just keep on checking.

3505
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:30,310
Just put all of them suspicious and then you just start marking people who you think it's not.

3506
02:32:30,550 --> 02:32:32,050
I did all my tasks.

3507
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:33,010
Holy cow.

3508
02:32:33,010 --> 02:32:35,070
Oh my god, we did so much.

3509
02:32:35,150 --> 02:32:35,710
Jesus.

3510
02:32:36,910 --> 02:32:37,470
Nice.

3511
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:40,650
Kira...

3512
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:42,110
Kira is a little confused.

3513
02:32:42,550 --> 02:32:43,710
Sleepy Kira.

3514
02:32:45,410 --> 02:32:46,590
It's OK, Kira.

3515
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:49,730
He's just going to kill when we least expect it.

3516
02:32:50,230 --> 02:32:52,990
Right away, I think we can rule out Doki and Snuffy.

3517
02:32:54,770 --> 02:32:55,550
Wait, why?

3518
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:58,810
People would already be dead if I was Kira.

3519
02:32:58,810 --> 02:33:02,950
If I was Kira, I would have killed people.

3520
02:33:03,470 --> 02:33:05,890
Belle, why did you say you were going to take a chip and eat it?

3521
02:33:06,650 --> 02:33:10,410
Because I was reciting the lines from the anime.

3522
02:33:10,930 --> 02:33:14,110
Yeah, but you could have recited an innocent person's line.

3523
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:16,490
Yeah, that's Kira's line.

3524
02:33:16,590 --> 02:33:17,390
That's a Kira line.

3525
02:33:18,010 --> 02:33:22,250
Yes, because it's a funny bit I do at the beginning of every round.

3526
02:33:23,770 --> 02:33:24,350
You know what?

3527
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:24,790
I believe...

3528
02:33:24,790 --> 02:33:27,670
I was with you in the beginning of one of the rounds and you didn't say it.

3529
02:33:27,670 --> 02:33:29,630
You didn't say it when I was with you last time.

3530
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:32,850
Because you were busy saying something sus too!

3531
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:34,710
I would never.

3532
02:33:34,890 --> 02:33:35,810
I would never.

3533
02:33:36,250 --> 02:33:39,830
You literally said, I can't wait to put everyone's names in this book.

3534
02:33:41,050 --> 02:33:41,850
Yeah, in my journal.

3535
02:33:42,010 --> 02:33:43,530
My investigation notepad.

3536
02:33:43,870 --> 02:33:45,230
Oh my god.

3537
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:50,050
This is a lot of accusations for literally nothing happening.

3538
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,990
I'm just going to say that.

3539
02:33:52,810 --> 02:33:54,350
Finally, some reasoning.

3540
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:58,730
Yeah, always sus if people are pointing out you the most immediately.

3541
02:33:58,990 --> 02:34:02,370
You took me at the start of the round, Snuffy, and my ID's gone.

3542
02:34:03,350 --> 02:34:05,170
I mean, I think my ID's gone too.

3543
02:34:05,390 --> 02:34:07,770
Has there been a round where somebody actually has never had their ID taken?

3544
02:34:07,770 --> 02:34:10,290
Wait, but if your ID's gone, who do you think took it?

3545
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:15,590
Well, I had to give Juniper a present, but then she was also proven to be the investigator.

3546
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:17,130
So I'm not really sure...

3547
02:34:17,130 --> 02:34:20,170
I think I was around, but you're not accusing me.

3548
02:34:20,650 --> 02:34:21,850
If I was right next to you too.

3549
02:34:21,850 --> 02:34:23,850
And Juniper's ID...

3550
02:34:24,410 --> 02:34:27,910
I feel like I can't go off of IDs, because I'm usually touching like 8 people.

3551
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:32,990
Whoever is checked on your investigation pad as like an exclamation point is somebody you were that close to.

3552
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:34,950
And it's usually like 5 out of 8 people.

3553
02:34:35,430 --> 02:34:36,530
I only have 8 people.

3554
02:34:36,810 --> 02:34:37,630
But I'm watching you.

3555
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:39,710
Who hasn't been touched this round?

3556
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:43,090
I said my ID and I was next to Juniper.

3557
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:45,490
And Juniper still has her ID, so we're fine.

3558
02:34:47,090 --> 02:34:48,550
But Juniper's good at this.

3559
02:34:49,490 --> 02:34:50,390
Okay, Bao.

3560
02:34:50,590 --> 02:34:52,150
I don't think it's you, after all.

3561
02:34:52,710 --> 02:34:53,950
Sorry for saying that.

3562
02:34:54,650 --> 02:34:55,450
That's okay.

3563
02:34:55,670 --> 02:34:56,630
I get it.

3564
02:34:57,570 --> 02:35:01,590
Not everyone understands my underground humor.

3565
02:35:01,890 --> 02:35:02,230
Yeah.

3566
02:35:03,990 --> 02:35:05,410
I think it's her.

3567
02:35:08,730 --> 02:35:14,110
Actually, I realized I marked that, but I didn't actually get close enough for her to steal it.

3568
02:35:14,610 --> 02:35:15,390
Death note test.

3569
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:16,490
Oh no!

3570
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:18,130
I'm going this way.

3571
02:35:20,010 --> 02:35:21,090
I'm going around.

3572
02:35:21,930 --> 02:35:23,610
Who are you waiting for, Giga?

3573
02:35:23,930 --> 02:35:25,090
Who are you waiting for?

3574
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:25,870
Oh shoot.

3575
02:35:26,370 --> 02:35:26,650
Alright.

3576
02:35:28,610 --> 02:35:30,510
Why aren't you resolving anything, huh?

3577
02:35:30,750 --> 02:35:31,190
Oh, okay.

3578
02:35:31,370 --> 02:35:33,070
I'm literally resolving right now.

3579
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:34,050
I literally just got here.

3580
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:34,810
Giga's here.

3581
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:35,690
Giga?

3582
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:36,650
No, it's just me.

3583
02:35:37,470 --> 02:35:39,370
No, there's only two people resolving.

3584
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:41,530
Giga, why aren't you resolving?

3585
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:43,330
Giga, it's you!

3586
02:35:43,850 --> 02:35:44,990
Giga, press it!

3587
02:35:45,010 --> 02:35:46,290
I was here before you!

3588
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:47,410
No, you weren't.

3589
02:35:47,590 --> 02:35:49,590
I didn't see it.

3590
02:35:49,590 --> 02:35:52,610
Alright, now I know if my ID is gone, now I know.

3591
02:35:52,710 --> 02:35:54,390
It's Giga, it's Giga, it's Giga.

3592
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:58,790
Yeah, I think it's Giga.

3593
02:35:59,210 --> 02:35:59,330
Hello?

3594
02:36:00,050 --> 02:36:00,870
Where's the classroom?

3595
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:01,590
Oh my God.

3596
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:03,790
Where's the classroom?

3597
02:36:04,330 --> 02:36:06,450
A player who could be curi... Oh, classroom is down here.

3598
02:36:07,190 --> 02:36:08,170
Body was found at the restroom.

3599
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:08,850
What the...

3600
02:36:08,850 --> 02:36:09,290
Body?

3601
02:36:10,650 --> 02:36:11,070
Body.

3602
02:36:11,490 --> 02:36:12,230
What's the restroom?

3603
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:14,590
Wait.

3604
02:36:15,630 --> 02:36:16,050
Huh?

3605
02:36:16,050 --> 02:36:16,870
Where's the restroom?

3606
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:19,110
I'm trying my best and...

3607
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:21,650
Where's the restroom?

3608
02:36:26,900 --> 02:36:27,980
Huh?

3609
02:36:28,440 --> 02:36:29,980
I'm gonna do my tasks.

3610
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:36,240
Help where?

3611
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:40,500
It's not on here.

3612
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:45,420
Top left?

3613
02:36:46,020 --> 02:36:46,620
Oh my God.

3614
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:48,500
What happened?

3615
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:56,780
What happened?

3616
02:36:56,780 --> 02:36:57,300
Wait, what happened?

3617
02:36:57,480 --> 02:36:58,620
Oh shoot, who died?

3618
02:37:11,380 --> 02:37:12,400
That's so true.

3619
02:37:14,260 --> 02:37:15,660
She makes a fair point.

3620
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:15,780
Wait.

3621
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:18,800
You think it's Doki?

3622
02:37:26,380 --> 02:37:28,180
I'm not gonna make the last person.

3623
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:29,520
Oh, maybe I will.

3624
02:37:30,760 --> 02:37:32,140
Oh, so close.

3625
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:34,840
There it is.

3626
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:35,540
It's over, dude.

3627
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:36,520
It's over.

3628
02:37:37,180 --> 02:37:38,020
The chef hat.

3629
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:40,500
Oh my God.

3630
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:45,660
Another heart attack.

3631
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:50,180
Oh, Juniper died too.

3632
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:53,460
She was just innocent.

3633
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:55,400
It's too good to be true.

3634
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:56,340
I'm the class clown.

3635
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,460
You should protect the people who get labeled as such.

3636
02:37:58,560 --> 02:37:59,660
They're obviously gonna be targeted.

3637
02:38:01,060 --> 02:38:02,540
I was supposed to monitor Amelie.

3638
02:38:02,760 --> 02:38:04,160
Don't even say it, bro.

3639
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:06,260
You're so dumb, dude.

3640
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:16,260
Amelie's trying to set me up and make it look like I killed them.

3641
02:38:16,260 --> 02:38:20,880
If you're Kira, you would literally be able to kill anyone from anywhere.

3642
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:24,400
Why would I kill both of them next to me and then just stand there?

3643
02:38:24,680 --> 02:38:25,420
Doki, I think it's you.

3644
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:27,000
Because you could be the follower.

3645
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:30,680
You could be a follower.

3646
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:32,120
You could be a sheep.

3647
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:36,880
Her last message was that also my ID has been stolen.

3648
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:38,120
Mine too.

3649
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:40,020
I wrote down who was close to me.

3650
02:38:40,020 --> 02:38:41,200
Wait, what if she killed a past mom?

3651
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:42,780
I was only close to Giga.

3652
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:45,780
Val, Mint, and Giga were close to me.

3653
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:47,040
I was only close to Giga.

3654
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:50,620
My ID got stolen and the only one I went close enough to this round was Giga.

3655
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:51,120
Yeah, me too.

3656
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:52,160
Because I gave her a thing.

3657
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:52,920
It's Giga.

3658
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:53,880
Oh, she gave me a present.

3659
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:54,880
She gave me a gift.

3660
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:56,520
I only got to defend myself.

3661
02:38:56,520 --> 02:39:00,420
I gave you a gift, but my ID got stolen and nobody else has been close enough to me.

3662
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:00,940
Yeah.

3663
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:04,820
None of you have died, though.

3664
02:39:05,020 --> 02:39:06,400
You think it's Giga, Val?

3665
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:09,220
I think Snuffy's the follower, baby.

3666
02:39:09,460 --> 02:39:10,000
Sorry, Snuffy.

3667
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:13,540
On what basis?

3668
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:14,420
I don't know anymore.

3669
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,080
Giga, what do you have to say for yourself?

3670
02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:22,520
Giga might not actually be...

3671
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:28,880
Giga might not actually be Kira because I also saw a witness say that an ID got, like, handed off.

3672
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:32,500
But I think Giga's involved either way.

3673
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:34,500
But also, Giga didn't help us with the body.

3674
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:37,760
Oh my god.

3675
02:39:37,820 --> 02:39:38,640
And I stepped back.

3676
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:39,820
That's true.

3677
02:39:40,200 --> 02:39:40,920
Because every time we stepped...

3678
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:43,320
Giga was on us while we were doing the body.

3679
02:39:43,660 --> 02:39:43,880
Yeah.

3680
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:50,080
I didn't click on it because every time we stack up, like, everyone's ID gets stolen, so I've been stepping back.

3681
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:50,400
Yeah, but you...

3682
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:51,580
I've been leaving, like, one or two to do it.

3683
02:39:51,580 --> 02:39:53,040
You stole the ID.

3684
02:39:53,140 --> 02:39:54,600
Yeah, but my ID's gone.

3685
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:56,980
That was the only time I was super close to people.

3686
02:39:57,540 --> 02:39:58,300
That's pretty suspect.

3687
02:39:58,300 --> 02:39:58,980
That's the only time?

3688
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:01,700
Yeah, that's the only time I'm really scared of physical touch.

3689
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:10,140
It could be Doki, but since we also have Lime's arseholes against Giga...

3690
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:12,020
I mean, I think it's enough votes already.

3691
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:15,300
I don't think you need to overcook.

3692
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:17,800
With two people dead, we should vote anyway.

3693
02:40:18,140 --> 02:40:18,360
True.

3694
02:40:18,620 --> 02:40:18,800
Yeah.

3695
02:40:18,980 --> 02:40:19,300
True.

3696
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:24,840
What does it mean to, like, does it matter who we pick to confiscate items?

3697
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,720
Because if you pick the bad person, they can get the bad.

3698
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:31,280
Yeah, if you pick a Kira follower, they can get it back, basically.

3699
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:35,360
Wait, why did you pick Kira Bow and went on a walk with me, Giga?

3700
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:38,580
What if Bow is a follower?

3701
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:40,140
I'm not!

3702
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:42,940
My name is Bow!

3703
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:47,780
I just dropped it.

3704
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:50,180
Very interesting.

3705
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:52,560
We cooked!

3706
02:40:54,900 --> 02:40:56,040
Oh, we did it.

3707
02:40:56,680 --> 02:40:57,980
I actually wasn't Kira originally.

3708
02:40:58,140 --> 02:41:02,620
I was the follower, and then, like, right before the round ended, it got passed to me, and I was like...

3709
02:41:02,620 --> 02:41:02,740
Unlucky.

3710
02:41:04,820 --> 02:41:15,560
I literally killed somebody right before Laimu saw me, and so I thought, like, Doki saw me so easily one time, so I thought Laimu would have just instantly seen me and been like, oh shit, I just saw her kill somebody, so I was like, uh, you can take this.

3711
02:41:15,860 --> 02:41:16,900
Laimu, how did you?

3712
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,460
Giga, you are so suspicious.

3713
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:21,480
I'm sorry, but how did you block nothing?

3714
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:23,760
Up to no good.

3715
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:24,660
How did you know?

3716
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:26,380
Oh my god.

3717
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:29,320
I can't believe it wasn't you, Bow.

3718
02:41:29,440 --> 02:41:30,040
I'm so sorry.

3719
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:31,280
One billion IQ.

3720
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:33,920
I can't believe it wasn't her.

3721
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:34,540
I get it.

3722
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:36,100
I get it.

3723
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:42,820
I was like, it's Bow, and then I went to go check the tiers, and I was like, oh, Bow is L, oh no.

3724
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:47,060
I literally mentioned my lead investigator too.

3725
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:48,680
You were L?

3726
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:50,940
What the...

3727
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:51,920
Oh my god.

3728
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:52,900
Oh my god.

3729
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:54,660
That was LG for me.

3730
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:55,640
I gotta run.

3731
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:56,620
That's LG.

3732
02:41:56,620 --> 02:41:56,780
Okay.

3733
02:41:58,980 --> 02:42:00,240
That was fun.

3734
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:01,180
Yeah, that was fun.

3735
02:42:01,220 --> 02:42:02,340
I'm sorry, Giga.

3736
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:03,260
That was so fun.

3737
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:03,800
Thank you.

3738
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:04,600
Thank you.

3739
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:05,980
Thank you, everybody.

3740
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:07,700
Thank you all for coming.

3741
02:42:08,100 --> 02:42:09,020
This was so much fun.

3742
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:09,980
Thanks for inviting.

3743
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:13,080
Bye, everyone.

3744
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:17,120
Bye, guys.

3745
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:18,200
Bye-bye.

3746
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:23,460
I like that this game has in-voice chat.

3747
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:24,740
It helps a lot.

3748
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:25,060
Yeah.

3749
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:29,760
That way, I can also do things where I can just make the game all about me.

3750
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:30,760
And it's Minecraft.

3751
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:31,280
No, I'm sorry.

3752
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:32,140
I'm not gonna do that again.

3753
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:35,620
You were so good.

3754
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:36,240
Thank you, guys.

3755
02:42:36,860 --> 02:42:38,380
Yeah, you were so good.

3756
02:42:38,380 --> 02:42:38,920
Oh, thank you.

3757
02:42:39,440 --> 02:42:40,780
I wanna get L sometime.

3758
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:41,440
That was really fun.

3759
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:42,060
Me too.

3760
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:42,700
I was thinking that.

3761
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:44,280
Yeah, I wanna get L too.

3762
02:42:44,480 --> 02:42:45,820
I wanna know what that was like.

3763
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:46,560
Yeah, yeah.

3764
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:47,620
Okay, thank you, guys.

3765
02:42:47,960 --> 02:42:48,440
Yeah, GG.

3766
02:42:48,760 --> 02:42:49,100
GG.

3767
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:50,180
Bye-bye.

3768
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:51,280
Sorry about the tech issues.

3769
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:51,940
Alright, bye.

3770
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:52,720
Bye.

3771
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:54,740
Room now.

3772
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:57,220
Oh, there it goes.

3773
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:59,620
Oh, it's my room now.

3774
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:07,400
That was so silly.

3775
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:09,640
What?

3776
02:43:09,940 --> 02:43:20,700
I think if they add a few more things to it, like a few more maps and tasks and things like that, I think it could be pretty solid.

3777
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:23,540
I like the different way that you have to investigate people.

3778
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:33,840
And the way you kill people is through getting their IDs and then having to do it sneakily through the notebook.

3779
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:43,360
It's kind of interesting because usually with games like Among Us or Duck... wait, Goose Goose Duck, you know the killer if they're close by.

3780
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:47,220
You'd be like, oh, I saw them running by, but you wouldn't know because they could kill them from anywhere.

3781
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:56,380
So it's kind of... it's a fun way to change that aspect of the game.

3782
02:43:57,540 --> 02:43:59,180
Yeah, the death note mechanics.

3783
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,920
Yeah, I hope they expand on it, though.

3784
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,360
That'd be fun if they do.

3785
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:05,000
Hopefully.

3786
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:07,460
Yeah, I like it.

3787
02:44:10,340 --> 02:44:12,200
Killing from anywhere adds a cool twist.

3788
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:13,200
I agree, I agree.

3789
02:44:20,630 --> 02:44:21,370
Hold on.

3790
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:33,960
We're just saying, like, thanks for this fun game.

3791
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:40,460
Because sometimes I know people don't like... Some people don't like these kinds of deduction games because sometimes they end up becoming like...

3792
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:45,840
Like, you feel actually gas, you know, like you're getting gas lit or something and you're just like, oh, I don't want to lie.

3793
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:46,860
I'm bad at lying.

3794
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:49,640
But I think we're all very goofy.

3795
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:52,280
So...

3796
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:54,780
David, welcome to Mambo Ship Dark.

3797
02:44:57,540 --> 02:44:59,340
Gonzayo, thanks for six months.

3798
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:00,940
And Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

3799
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:04,740
I'm gonna...

3800
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:06,700
Yeah, hopefully we get more maps.

3801
02:45:06,820 --> 02:45:07,900
I think that would help a lot.

3802
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:11,080
Different locations and things.

3803
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:17,440
Reminds me of a death note mod for Lethal Company.

3804
02:45:17,860 --> 02:45:18,200
What?

3805
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:19,420
That exists?

3806
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:23,880
I've been asking... I was telling Limu I really want to play Lethal Company.

3807
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:28,100
Like, I never got to play Lethal Company, really, when the big boom happened.

3808
02:45:28,700 --> 02:45:31,400
So I'm, like, always still itching to play those kinds of games.

3809
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:33,100
They're so fun for me.

3810
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:35,940
Like, I think I could play, like, a whole week of Lethal Company.

3811
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:37,380
You know?

3812
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:41,120
I was completely lost at first, but the game looks fun after you figure it out.

3813
02:45:41,360 --> 02:45:41,820
How it works.

3814
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:42,500
Thanks for the fun collab.

3815
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:42,820
Yeah!

3816
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:45,720
Yeah, no, I think we all were lost, right?

3817
02:45:45,720 --> 02:45:49,900
I think we all were pretty lost.

3818
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:51,520
I'm going to switch over.

3819
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:55,920
I want to chat.

3820
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,140
Oh, where's my chat?

3821
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:58,560
Where'd you guys go?

3822
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:00,860
Where'd you guys go?

3823
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:03,220
I want to talk for a bit before I head out.

3824
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:04,560
Oh, there you are.

3825
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,100
Give me some music.

3826
02:46:08,180 --> 02:46:10,600
There's a song, a piano man.

3827
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:16,300
There we go.

3828
02:46:19,180 --> 02:46:19,620
Invisible.

3829
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:26,890
Loading...

3830
02:46:26,890 --> 02:46:27,470
So late.

3831
02:46:27,530 --> 02:46:28,030
Thank you!

3832
02:46:28,470 --> 02:46:29,070
For a whole month?

3833
02:46:29,170 --> 02:46:29,610
Thanks!

3834
02:46:31,230 --> 02:46:32,150
It looks fun.

3835
02:46:32,390 --> 02:46:33,630
I have friends to play.

3836
02:46:33,790 --> 02:46:35,270
Nan, you can play online.

3837
02:46:35,550 --> 02:46:38,510
I think there was, like, open lobbies, too, so...

3838
02:46:39,770 --> 02:46:42,130
There were open lobbies, too, if you want to play.

3839
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:47,910
Or, I'm sure you could get people in the Minto Discord together if anybody wanted to play.

3840
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:49,770
How's my migraine?

3841
02:46:49,870 --> 02:46:50,510
I'm good!

3842
02:46:50,970 --> 02:46:51,810
Thanks for asking.

3843
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:54,270
Yeah, I feel so much better.

3844
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:55,530
I feel so good.

3845
02:46:55,850 --> 02:46:57,210
I got lots done today.

3846
02:46:57,330 --> 02:47:07,590
I was cleaning lots, and I was practicing a lot of the dance for the Phantom Thief concert.

3847
02:47:08,990 --> 02:47:11,250
So, I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good.

3848
02:47:11,550 --> 02:47:12,090
There's a Discord?

3849
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:17,210
Yeah, I'm sure if you ever ask some Wisps, they could give you a Discord with the link.

3850
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:18,770
Thanks for the stream, Minto!

3851
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:20,670
So I can finally chat on PC again.

3852
02:47:21,350 --> 02:47:21,710
Yippee!

3853
02:47:22,430 --> 02:47:24,050
YouTube's so silly.

3854
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:25,470
So silly.

3855
02:47:26,710 --> 02:47:27,390
So silly.

3856
02:47:30,490 --> 02:47:32,230
Yeah, I had lots of fun with this.

3857
02:47:32,350 --> 02:47:33,550
I always like these kinds of games.

3858
02:47:33,630 --> 02:47:37,170
This one, I think, like I said, if I had a little bit more...

3859
02:47:37,170 --> 02:47:41,350
I think probably my favorite of all of them is Goose Goose Duck.

3860
02:47:41,350 --> 02:47:49,250
I think it's the most variety, and the most maps, and in-game features.

3861
02:47:50,650 --> 02:47:53,310
It's the ghostest with the mostest.

3862
02:47:55,630 --> 02:47:56,850
I think so.

3863
02:47:59,890 --> 02:48:01,930
You've seen me play that game the most.

3864
02:48:04,690 --> 02:48:07,110
Oh, I've never streamed that game before.

3865
02:48:11,730 --> 02:48:13,130
Are you seeing ghosts?

3866
02:48:21,250 --> 02:48:23,190
Yeah, I've never streamed that game.

3867
02:48:26,270 --> 02:48:27,730
Mint Discord is unofficial, right?

3868
02:48:27,810 --> 02:48:28,630
Yeah, it's unofficial.

3869
02:48:28,850 --> 02:48:29,950
I don't have an official Discord.

3870
02:48:30,910 --> 02:48:35,450
I don't plan on ever having an official Discord, but...

3871
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:36,150
I don't know.

3872
02:48:36,150 --> 02:48:40,430
I used to have one a long, long time ago.

3873
02:48:47,910 --> 02:48:50,070
It's been a minute since I've done Akiba Tour.

3874
02:48:51,070 --> 02:48:52,370
A little bit has changed.

3875
02:48:53,170 --> 02:48:57,790
I wonder if the Google Maps has updated from some of the new buildings.

3876
02:48:58,270 --> 02:48:59,890
Like, there's a whole new Appa Hotel.

3877
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:00,810
It's crazy.

3878
02:49:00,970 --> 02:49:04,470
Now there's like four Appa Hotels in Akiba.

3879
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:06,490
It's crazy.

3880
02:49:07,670 --> 02:49:10,450
I'm like, can you not build that?

3881
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:16,270
Can you build something else instead?

3882
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:18,190
I get it though.

3883
02:49:18,270 --> 02:49:22,710
A lot of the buildings I feel in Akiba recently have been needing to be torn down.

3884
02:49:23,270 --> 02:49:29,530
I think that's kind of the case with the Mr. Donuts.

3885
02:49:30,990 --> 02:49:33,290
I think the building is really old.

3886
02:49:33,290 --> 02:49:37,490
I think a lot of buildings in Akiba are really old and needing to be updated.

3887
02:49:41,510 --> 02:49:46,210
Imagine a Metal Gear style game where everyone is guards trying to figure out who's snaking right in.

3888
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:55,510
That sounds like the most fun game ever.

3889
02:50:01,810 --> 02:50:03,290
That would be the...

3890
02:50:06,210 --> 02:50:08,750
Who knows how to program?

3891
02:50:09,450 --> 02:50:10,030
Joji!

3892
02:50:12,090 --> 02:50:15,630
Joji, I'm ready to throw money at you again.

3893
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,020
Let's go.

3894
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:33,420
I think Konami wouldn't like that.

3895
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:35,420
It's Plissken.

3896
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:37,060
Snake Plissken.

3897
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:40,200
I wouldn't be making any money off of it.

3898
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:45,660
I don't think Konami is like Nintendo where even if you make a fan property, they shut you down.

3899
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:46,960
Right?

3900
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:53,090
Probably.

3901
02:50:59,990 --> 02:51:00,510
Maybe.

3902
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:04,430
Konami, please.

3903
02:51:06,530 --> 02:51:07,430
Konami, please.

3904
02:51:07,550 --> 02:51:09,230
You mean Escape from New York, Snake Plissken?

3905
02:51:09,550 --> 02:51:09,910
Yeah.

3906
02:51:10,950 --> 02:51:12,250
Oh wait, but then...

3907
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:13,250
It's just a fan game.

3908
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:16,790
Snake Among Us fan game.

3909
02:51:19,410 --> 02:51:22,830
Wait, has Konami actually shut down multiple projects before?

3910
02:51:23,450 --> 02:51:25,670
I don't keep up with stuff like that usually.

3911
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:34,820
They made official Castlevania DLC for Vampire Survivors, so you never know.

3912
02:51:35,560 --> 02:51:36,860
Yeah, exactly.

3913
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:40,640
Well, Vampire Survivors like blew up.

3914
02:51:41,620 --> 02:51:43,660
So, we just have to make...

3915
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:46,060
We just have to make...

3916
02:51:46,060 --> 02:51:48,060
Oh, wait, P.T.?

3917
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:49,720
P.T.

3918
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:52,020
was not a fan game, you guys.

3919
02:51:57,980 --> 02:51:58,920
P.T.?

3920
02:51:58,920 --> 02:52:00,620
I meant fan games.

3921
02:52:00,940 --> 02:52:01,240
P.T.

3922
02:52:01,320 --> 02:52:02,300
was them.

3923
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:05,820
Oh, there was a fan remake.

3924
02:52:14,170 --> 02:52:15,750
There was a P.T.

3925
02:52:15,810 --> 02:52:17,090
fan remake that was shut down.

3926
02:52:20,130 --> 02:52:20,950
I see.

3927
02:52:22,030 --> 02:52:22,890
I see.

3928
02:52:27,490 --> 02:52:33,470
Well, I'll just make it not Metal Gear, and then maybe one day we can get the Metal Gear collaboration.

3929
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:41,340
Nobody will play it though, because Among Us boom is gone.

3930
02:52:43,260 --> 02:52:44,220
So sad.

3931
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:46,700
Nobody wants to play Among Us games anymore.

3932
02:52:47,580 --> 02:52:49,040
Among Us boom is gone.

3933
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:56,020
You guys hear that clicking?

3934
02:52:59,900 --> 02:53:01,420
What is that noise?

3935
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:02,300
Is that my computer?

3936
02:53:02,480 --> 02:53:02,860
Hold on.

3937
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:04,560
What is that?

3938
02:53:13,100 --> 02:53:14,280
That's my computer.

3939
02:53:34,330 --> 02:53:35,570
I think the pump failing?

3940
02:53:35,730 --> 02:53:36,930
I think so, actually.

3941
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:39,790
I've been having like a strange rattling recently.

3942
02:53:40,890 --> 02:53:45,290
That's either the fan or my cool...

3943
02:53:48,580 --> 02:53:50,740
I think it's my fan.

3944
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:51,800
I've been having issues with...

3945
02:53:51,800 --> 02:53:53,860
This is the loudest it's rattled before though.

3946
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:56,080
Yeah, you hear it?

3947
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:59,000
I hate these stupid Corsair fans.

3948
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:03,040
Oh my gosh, Corsair, I used to believe in you and now I'm such an auntie.

3949
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:05,560
There goes my ever sponsorship.

3950
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:17,840
These fans are so garbage.

3951
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:19,080
I hate them so much.

3952
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:23,460
Because they're like RGB fans, but their lights are totally off color.

3953
02:54:23,900 --> 02:54:24,780
It's so bad.

3954
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:29,200
I'm scared.

3955
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:30,560
Is my PC gonna be okay?

3956
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:32,380
I'll check it after stream.

3957
02:54:34,240 --> 02:54:37,440
My Corsair LED fan needs to be replaced because of a busted LED.

3958
02:54:38,320 --> 02:54:39,800
Corsair fans are terrible.

3959
02:54:46,630 --> 02:54:52,690
I think the rattling, what was rattling in it before just became more loose.

3960
02:54:53,150 --> 02:54:53,650
I think.

3961
02:54:53,990 --> 02:54:54,750
That's what has happened.

3962
02:54:55,750 --> 02:54:57,030
You are stupid.

3963
02:54:57,350 --> 02:54:57,890
Stupid.

3964
02:54:58,350 --> 02:54:59,190
Aw man.

3965
02:54:59,390 --> 02:55:01,550
Wait, when am I streaming tomorrow?

3966
02:55:02,090 --> 02:55:04,010
Oh shoot, we're doing...

3967
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:06,190
Oh no, we're doing Minecraft.

3968
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:08,310
Oh gosh, computer, you have to hold out.

3969
02:55:08,370 --> 02:55:09,130
We're doing Minecraft.

3970
02:55:10,110 --> 02:55:11,010
Oh god.

3971
02:55:13,410 --> 02:55:14,810
You have to hold out.

3972
02:55:14,910 --> 02:55:17,710
I'm gonna be streaming for like probably 12 hours tomorrow.

3973
02:55:18,310 --> 02:55:20,290
Oh no, more doki.

3974
02:55:25,210 --> 02:55:28,750
I upgraded my computer with dual monitors just to watch you while playing games.

3975
02:55:29,830 --> 02:55:30,790
That's cool!

3976
02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:32,090
Hot dog.

3977
02:55:34,370 --> 02:55:36,550
Breaking news, Minto hates her fans.

3978
02:55:36,710 --> 02:55:37,170
Stop!

3979
02:55:37,450 --> 02:55:37,670
No!

3980
02:55:40,610 --> 02:55:42,750
Oh, it's such an annoying sound.

3981
02:55:42,830 --> 02:55:44,170
I'm sorry guys, I'm sorry.

3982
02:55:51,540 --> 02:55:52,960
It's so annoying for me.

3983
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:55,580
I can't believe I can hear it through my headphones.

3984
02:56:01,140 --> 02:56:02,200
This is fun.

3985
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:06,140
Oh wait, I forgot to put my menu back up.

3986
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:06,580
Hold on.

3987
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:09,820
There we go.

3988
02:56:12,200 --> 02:56:14,400
Oh my gosh, Minto 3.0 debut!

3989
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:21,600
I can also hear it through my headphones, I'm sorry.

3990
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:22,940
ViviCorn, thanks for the gifted!

3991
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:26,120
Hold on, let me hit it.

3992
02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:29,360
Oh!

3993
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:30,300
That worked!

3994
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:41,940
If I press down on the top of my... If I press down on the top of my tower...

3995
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:47,150
It stops for just a little bit.

3996
02:56:48,730 --> 02:56:50,150
Oh, there it goes.

3997
02:56:50,430 --> 02:56:54,270
If I like press... That's why I think I know it's the fan, because my fans are up top.

3998
02:56:54,550 --> 02:56:56,750
When I press down on it, it stops rattling.

3999
02:56:57,930 --> 02:56:58,590
And it's back.

4000
02:57:04,370 --> 02:57:05,650
There it goes.

4001
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:15,640
Fan problem.

4002
02:57:16,140 --> 02:57:17,080
Might be a loose screw.

4003
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:19,380
Hey, what are you saying about me?

4004
02:57:20,060 --> 02:57:21,260
You're saying I have a screw loose?

4005
02:57:22,960 --> 02:57:24,020
Well you're right!

4006
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:27,480
Well you're right!

4007
02:57:36,650 --> 02:57:37,530
Stop it!

4008
02:57:50,980 --> 02:57:51,900
It doesn't listen to me.

4009
02:57:52,620 --> 02:57:54,700
Okay, I was gonna talk for longer.

4010
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:55,720
Ow, I just bit my...

4011
02:57:55,720 --> 02:58:00,140
I was gonna talk for longer, but now I feel like I have to look at my fan.

4012
02:58:01,220 --> 02:58:02,100
Oh gosh.

4013
02:58:03,340 --> 02:58:04,840
Didn't cause issues for a long time.

4014
02:58:04,940 --> 02:58:05,360
That's good.

4015
02:58:05,540 --> 02:58:08,060
Rattling fan is often just the fan sagging.

4016
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:10,960
Can sometimes push them back on their spindle.

4017
02:58:10,960 --> 02:58:15,880
If you want nice RGB fans, look at Lee and Lee Uni fans.

4018
02:58:16,240 --> 02:58:17,100
Are they in white though?

4019
02:58:18,940 --> 02:58:19,340
Sorry.

4020
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:21,280
I have an all white PC.

4021
02:58:22,500 --> 02:58:23,800
Are the Lee and Lee ones in white?

4022
02:58:23,960 --> 02:58:25,760
I used to have a Lee and Lee case.

4023
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:26,900
I like Lee and Lee stuff.

4024
02:58:29,980 --> 02:58:31,080
They make them in white?

4025
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:33,320
Yippee!

4026
02:58:34,840 --> 02:58:35,640
Japan takeover.

4027
02:58:36,340 --> 02:58:36,660
No!

4028
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:37,400
No!

4029
02:58:42,650 --> 02:58:45,190
Oh my gosh, it's gonna drive me insane.

4030
02:58:45,410 --> 02:58:46,930
I'm sorry guys.

4031
02:58:51,950 --> 02:58:54,370
John Yakuza, welcome to my workshop.

4032
02:58:54,510 --> 02:58:55,190
Thank you!

4033
02:58:57,450 --> 02:58:58,830
Minto PC case win?

4034
02:58:59,990 --> 02:59:01,750
I'm not popular enough.

4035
02:59:02,750 --> 02:59:06,290
I think I'm not popular enough for me to get a PC case.

4036
02:59:07,350 --> 02:59:13,750
I was thinking today, I would like to get to maybe 300k by the end of the year.

4037
02:59:14,930 --> 02:59:16,110
I don't know if it's possible.

4038
02:59:17,710 --> 02:59:18,890
I was thinking of ways.

4039
02:59:19,350 --> 02:59:24,130
Usually I don't care so much about my subscriber stuff.

4040
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:27,230
But I was like, what can I...

4041
02:59:27,230 --> 02:59:29,290
What can I try and do...

4042
02:59:32,650 --> 02:59:33,110
To...

4043
02:59:34,310 --> 02:59:35,350
I don't know.

4044
02:59:35,450 --> 02:59:36,930
I was just like, what can I do?

4045
02:59:42,850 --> 02:59:43,770
You know.

4046
02:59:44,710 --> 02:59:45,550
You're going fast?

4047
02:59:46,510 --> 02:59:48,590
I think I'm going at my own Minto pace.

4048
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:54,570
I usually don't care, like I said, about my subscriber count.

4049
02:59:54,570 --> 02:59:59,590
The only times when I care is when I want to collaborate with something.

4050
03:00:00,310 --> 03:00:08,490
When I'm just like, I want to collaborate with this creator or this company or something.

4051
03:00:08,930 --> 03:00:12,990
If I had more subscribers, maybe they would look at me.

4052
03:00:15,810 --> 03:00:18,450
I don't think I'm doing poorly or anything.

4053
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:19,970
I'm not upset about it.

4054
03:00:20,350 --> 03:00:22,470
It's only then when I'm like...

4055
03:00:24,570 --> 03:00:25,550
I'm not popular enough.

4056
03:00:31,910 --> 03:00:32,430
But...

4057
03:00:32,430 --> 03:00:33,390
You know, it's okay.

4058
03:00:34,510 --> 03:00:36,650
I'm very comfortable where I am, you know.

4059
03:00:37,090 --> 03:00:39,410
Thanks for the 20 gift, thank you.

4060
03:00:39,930 --> 03:00:40,750
Thank you, thank you.

4061
03:00:42,670 --> 03:00:44,170
For algorithm reasons?

4062
03:00:45,010 --> 03:00:48,490
It's less algorithm reasons and more like...

4063
03:00:48,490 --> 03:00:52,210
Sometimes if I want to work with a company or something...

4064
03:00:52,210 --> 03:00:56,810
They won't take me seriously because they might think that my numbers are too low.

4065
03:00:56,910 --> 03:00:57,510
You know what I mean?

4066
03:00:58,290 --> 03:00:59,430
Stuff like that.

4067
03:01:00,690 --> 03:01:02,710
Not like a...

4068
03:01:02,710 --> 03:01:05,290
It's like the perception to them.

4069
03:01:05,490 --> 03:01:07,210
Like, oh, you don't have...

4070
03:01:07,210 --> 03:01:09,070
You don't have...

4071
03:01:09,070 --> 03:01:11,050
1 million subscribers?

4072
03:01:11,910 --> 03:01:13,170
You're not popular.

4073
03:01:13,650 --> 03:01:14,470
Kind of deal.

4074
03:01:18,310 --> 03:01:18,910
So...

4075
03:01:18,910 --> 03:01:20,210
Yeah, it's really just that.

4076
03:01:24,590 --> 03:01:25,850
But, you know.

4077
03:01:27,390 --> 03:01:29,310
Not that I've been told that before or anything.

4078
03:01:29,530 --> 03:01:32,430
Recently, it's been frustrating sometimes because I'll like...

4079
03:01:34,330 --> 03:01:37,350
I've reached out to places before and they've been like...

4080
03:01:39,770 --> 03:01:41,350
They've been like...

4081
03:01:41,910 --> 03:01:45,370
Oh, we won't work with you because you're not in a company.

4082
03:01:47,070 --> 03:01:49,510
That's what I run into the most, honestly.

4083
03:01:49,970 --> 03:01:52,730
But then, you know, like I said, I don't probably get...

4084
03:01:52,730 --> 03:01:57,090
Emails for like certain sponsorships or stuff because my numbers are not high.

4085
03:01:58,390 --> 03:02:01,130
Or as high as other people, so...

4086
03:02:02,610 --> 03:02:04,350
But it is what it is.

4087
03:02:07,610 --> 03:02:08,990
Yeah, it kind of sucks.

4088
03:02:09,810 --> 03:02:13,010
There was one artist that I really wanted to work with.

4089
03:02:13,950 --> 03:02:16,390
Not like for my model or anything.

4090
03:02:16,910 --> 03:02:20,470
But just one artist I wanted to work with and they were like...

4091
03:02:20,470 --> 03:02:22,470
Sorry, I only work with...

4092
03:02:24,330 --> 03:02:26,470
Creators in a company.

4093
03:02:26,930 --> 03:02:28,270
And I was like...

4094
03:02:28,270 --> 03:02:29,050
Okay.

4095
03:02:30,250 --> 03:02:31,170
Thank you.

4096
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:34,890
So...

4097
03:02:36,030 --> 03:02:37,230
It is...

4098
03:02:37,230 --> 03:02:38,870
It is what it is.

4099
03:02:39,070 --> 03:02:39,510
It's okay.

4100
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:51,540
But like I said, I don't...

4101
03:02:51,540 --> 03:02:53,120
I'm not like...

4102
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:55,900
It doesn't like get me down or anything.

4103
03:02:55,900 --> 03:02:57,680
I'm just kind of just like...

4104
03:02:57,680 --> 03:02:58,400
You know.

4105
03:02:58,700 --> 03:02:59,900
But I'm not like...

4106
03:02:59,900 --> 03:03:00,380
Upset.

4107
03:03:00,520 --> 03:03:04,080
Again, I'm not like crying about my numbers or anything like that.

4108
03:03:04,420 --> 03:03:06,800
I feel very comfortable and I'm very grateful...

4109
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:09,200
That so many people even...

4110
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:11,900
Found me when I came back, so...

4111
03:03:13,820 --> 03:03:16,100
Mental Evil Incorporated.

4112
03:03:18,380 --> 03:03:19,800
But like I said, I do...

4113
03:03:19,800 --> 03:03:21,380
I do have like a...

4114
03:03:21,380 --> 03:03:26,020
A background in my brain goal of 300k by the end of the year.

4115
03:03:26,120 --> 03:03:27,360
So we'll see if I get there.

4116
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:28,280
I'll do my best.

4117
03:03:28,660 --> 03:03:29,220
I'll try and...

4118
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:31,820
I'll be more entertaining.

4119
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:34,000
And I'll reach out.

4120
03:03:34,360 --> 03:03:35,440
And I'll...

4121
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:38,620
I'll do fun stuff.

4122
03:03:40,540 --> 03:03:42,000
Burpee thanks for the 5 gifted.

4123
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:53,280
We can do it.

4124
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:54,200
Thank you!

4125
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:54,820
Yeah!

4126
03:03:58,660 --> 03:04:00,180
We will do our part.

4127
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:01,440
Yeah, you're already doing it.

4128
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:02,060
You're already here.

4129
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:02,740
You're watching me.

4130
03:04:03,140 --> 03:04:04,360
Really appreciate it.

4131
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:07,440
Others might feel the same about you.

4132
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:09,300
I'm not popular enough to collab with Mint.

4133
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:10,560
Well, maybe.

4134
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:15,240
For me, it's not like collabing with people though.

4135
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:16,220
It's more like a...

4136
03:04:17,700 --> 03:04:18,440
Like a...

4137
03:04:18,440 --> 03:04:19,140
I want...

4138
03:04:19,140 --> 03:04:21,700
I want opportunities with the companies.

4139
03:04:22,320 --> 03:04:24,700
Like I want to get the sponsorships.

4140
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:30,180
Or the collaborations with the companies.

4141
03:04:31,680 --> 03:04:32,280
So...

4142
03:04:32,280 --> 03:04:33,220
It's just...

4143
03:04:33,220 --> 03:04:34,300
It's like a...

4144
03:04:34,300 --> 03:04:36,360
Just one of those things that, you know...

4145
03:04:36,360 --> 03:04:37,760
I never...

4146
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:38,880
It's so weird.

4147
03:04:39,060 --> 03:04:40,420
Like, I mean, I know I've been...

4148
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:44,220
I've been full-time content creator for a bit now.

4149
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:46,580
But it's still very like...

4150
03:04:46,580 --> 03:04:49,460
I'm not a business-minded person.

4151
03:04:50,380 --> 03:04:50,620
Usually.

4152
03:04:51,340 --> 03:04:53,580
So it's hard for me to kind of like...

4153
03:04:54,160 --> 03:04:56,720
Quote-unquote play the business games and stuff.

4154
03:04:59,020 --> 03:05:01,620
Get a gamer subs cup made only...

4155
03:05:01,620 --> 03:05:03,080
Make it available through...

4156
03:05:03,080 --> 03:05:07,060
Danny Mustang, welcome to membership.

4157
03:05:07,400 --> 03:05:07,820
Thank you.

4158
03:05:11,560 --> 03:05:11,840
So...

4159
03:05:12,680 --> 03:05:14,580
Yeah, so I'm not very...

4160
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:16,480
Business-minded.

4161
03:05:17,740 --> 03:05:19,760
So it's harder probably for me to...

4162
03:05:20,580 --> 03:05:23,160
Get those kinds of offers.

4163
03:05:23,980 --> 03:05:24,420
Probably.

4164
03:05:27,380 --> 03:05:28,580
That's okay.

4165
03:05:30,720 --> 03:05:32,040
One day, hopefully.

4166
03:05:35,730 --> 03:05:37,050
Yeah, hopefully one day.

4167
03:05:39,970 --> 03:05:40,970
MGS collab.

4168
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:49,400
MGS collab.

4169
03:05:49,400 --> 03:05:51,500
Gonna be coming to see you...

4170
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:52,320
In two weeks.

4171
03:05:53,200 --> 03:05:55,680
Oh, wait, two weeks after my birth...

4172
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:56,300
Wait, it's...

4173
03:05:56,300 --> 03:05:58,140
Best birthday gift I could ask for.

4174
03:05:58,440 --> 03:05:59,640
Oh, you're coming to the concert?

4175
03:05:59,800 --> 03:06:00,440
Thank you!

4176
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:01,720
I was like, wait...

4177
03:06:06,100 --> 03:06:07,060
Thank you, thank you.

4178
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:10,440
Wait, so your birthday is two weeks...

4179
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:13,300
After the concert or before the concert?

4180
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:17,320
Do we do like a birthday song at the concert?

4181
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:21,640
What do we say, belated birthday or...

4182
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:23,820
Early birthday?

4183
03:06:31,340 --> 03:06:32,220
Coming to see you.

4184
03:06:33,040 --> 03:06:34,820
Let's hit up my maid cafe.

4185
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:36,840
In virtual Akihabara.

4186
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:41,980
Prelated birthday.

4187
03:06:42,600 --> 03:06:43,480
There we go.

4188
03:06:44,200 --> 03:06:44,860
Prelated.

4189
03:06:44,860 --> 03:06:44,980
Prelated.

4190
03:06:48,890 --> 03:06:51,810
I'm glad that we can give you that for your birthday.

4191
03:07:01,930 --> 03:07:04,830
I was gonna say it stopped, but I still hear it.

4192
03:07:05,230 --> 03:07:07,030
I'm gonna think I'm gonna open up...

4193
03:07:07,030 --> 03:07:08,470
Open up my computer now.

4194
03:07:09,690 --> 03:07:13,050
Going to start handing out postcards on the streets like mixed days.

4195
03:07:15,250 --> 03:07:15,770
Okay.

4196
03:07:15,770 --> 03:07:18,750
I used to do that, actually, when I did some idol activities.

4197
03:07:19,030 --> 03:07:23,590
I would stand in Akihabara and I would hand out little things.

4198
03:07:24,090 --> 03:07:28,130
Like little handmade flyers and be like, come see my show!

4199
03:07:29,390 --> 03:07:30,170
Shale dude!

4200
03:07:31,690 --> 03:07:32,130
Sensei!

4201
03:07:32,450 --> 03:07:33,510
Thank you for the superchat.

4202
03:07:37,130 --> 03:07:38,070
Thank you, thank you.

4203
03:07:41,670 --> 03:07:42,110
So...

4204
03:07:43,070 --> 03:07:44,290
Maybe I should do that.

4205
03:07:44,290 --> 03:07:48,290
How do I virtually hand out a flyer?

4206
03:07:48,390 --> 03:07:48,850
I don't know.

4207
03:07:49,650 --> 03:07:51,250
It's kind of why I've been posting...

4208
03:07:51,250 --> 03:07:53,310
I've been really annoying, but I've been like posting more...

4209
03:07:55,770 --> 03:07:58,490
More pictures on Twitter.

4210
03:07:59,070 --> 03:08:01,590
Like, hey, notice my new model.

4211
03:08:02,250 --> 03:08:03,730
Come see my streams!

4212
03:08:03,870 --> 03:08:05,010
Come see my streams!

4213
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:08,630
Post an ad.

4214
03:08:09,910 --> 03:08:11,530
What kind of ad would I...

4215
03:08:12,610 --> 03:08:14,250
Do ads on YouTube work?

4216
03:08:14,750 --> 03:08:17,030
When you guys give VTuber ads, do they work for you?

4217
03:08:18,230 --> 03:08:20,150
Sometimes I check them out.

4218
03:08:20,370 --> 03:08:20,910
Sometimes.

4219
03:08:25,480 --> 03:08:26,920
VRChat flyer giveaway.

4220
03:08:27,740 --> 03:08:28,920
How do I give away that?

4221
03:08:30,060 --> 03:08:30,500
No?

4222
03:08:30,820 --> 03:08:32,140
Oh wait, you have ads blocked?

4223
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:35,220
Doki had some?

4224
03:08:35,280 --> 03:08:35,600
Really?

4225
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:41,240
I always advertise Mintoshi as my bumper sticker.

4226
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:42,940
Thank you!

4227
03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:47,620
Thank you, Squattle...

4228
03:08:47,620 --> 03:08:56,140
I got premium now.

4229
03:08:57,620 --> 03:08:58,500
Fancy!

4230
03:09:06,890 --> 03:09:08,590
Clubs work best for you.

4231
03:09:09,570 --> 03:09:11,530
Makes sense, makes sense, makes sense.

4232
03:09:12,670 --> 03:09:13,110
Shorts?

4233
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:14,570
Oh yeah, shorts.

4234
03:09:14,570 --> 03:09:15,590
Shorts are big, huh?

4235
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:22,770
I'm writing things down.

4236
03:09:23,310 --> 03:09:24,270
I can save my money.

4237
03:09:24,590 --> 03:09:25,190
I can do shorts.

4238
03:09:25,290 --> 03:09:27,570
Actually, I need to get a new shorts editor.

4239
03:09:27,790 --> 03:09:30,830
I think my editor is taking a break.

4240
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:34,050
I need to get a new one.

4241
03:09:39,380 --> 03:09:41,580
I don't know how to cater my shorts.

4242
03:09:41,780 --> 03:09:43,420
Because my shorts are always like...

4243
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:45,160
Shorts for normies.

4244
03:09:45,160 --> 03:09:46,520
I hate it.

4245
03:09:46,580 --> 03:09:50,200
That's why I never go through the shorts on YouTube.

4246
03:09:50,420 --> 03:09:52,360
I always go through them on my TikTok.

4247
03:09:52,580 --> 03:09:55,220
Because I've catered my TikTok to me, but...

4248
03:09:56,620 --> 03:09:59,180
Oh, vertical streams.

4249
03:09:59,320 --> 03:09:59,840
Oh yeah.

4250
03:10:00,860 --> 03:10:03,240
Maybe I should do like a vertical karaoke.

4251
03:10:05,120 --> 03:10:06,600
Minto, will you ever play Tetri again?

4252
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:08,000
I got an update.

4253
03:10:09,020 --> 03:10:11,300
And the new quick play is nice to practice surviving.

4254
03:10:11,420 --> 03:10:13,060
It's just climbing floors until you die.

4255
03:10:13,060 --> 03:10:15,100
You can only attack people on the same floor.

4256
03:10:17,900 --> 03:10:21,400
I don't have any plans anytime soon, but I would never say never.

4257
03:10:25,610 --> 03:10:29,310
Yeah, but I don't know how to cater my YouTube shorts to me.

4258
03:10:29,550 --> 03:10:31,670
Like, they're always very weird normie stuff.

4259
03:10:31,950 --> 03:10:34,870
Like, haha, I'm pulling this prank on my wife.

4260
03:10:34,890 --> 03:10:38,510
And it's very clearly like a fake thing.

4261
03:10:39,350 --> 03:10:42,890
I don't know how I stop those stupid shorts.

4262
03:10:42,890 --> 03:10:44,850
I don't like them.

4263
03:10:46,070 --> 03:10:47,150
They're so annoying.

4264
03:10:50,210 --> 03:10:54,970
Like, is there a different algorithm, I wonder, for YouTube shorts than there is for...

4265
03:10:55,890 --> 03:10:57,890
Than there is for...

4266
03:10:59,430 --> 03:11:00,590
YouTube videos.

4267
03:11:01,530 --> 03:11:02,990
What's a TikTok I like?

4268
03:11:04,350 --> 03:11:05,510
Try not to be scared.

4269
03:11:06,190 --> 03:11:07,170
Scariest stories.

4270
03:11:08,630 --> 03:11:12,830
I've been almost non-stop listening to those.

4271
03:11:13,130 --> 03:11:14,070
Try not to be scared.

4272
03:11:14,710 --> 03:11:15,590
Scariest stories.

4273
03:11:17,930 --> 03:11:18,930
Have you guys seen those?

4274
03:11:18,970 --> 03:11:19,590
They're so funny.

4275
03:11:23,050 --> 03:11:24,250
They're so...

4276
03:11:25,110 --> 03:11:26,730
They're so stupid.

4277
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:29,750
Tell us one?

4278
03:11:30,610 --> 03:11:31,270
Okay, hold on.

4279
03:11:31,630 --> 03:11:32,550
It was like...

4280
03:11:32,550 --> 03:11:33,210
Okay, hold on.

4281
03:11:37,470 --> 03:11:38,370
Okay, hold on.

4282
03:11:40,150 --> 03:11:42,670
If they're really stupid, it'll be like...

4283
03:11:42,670 --> 03:11:47,630
It'll be like, I sure hope the spooky knife guy isn't in this room.

4284
03:11:48,930 --> 03:11:50,150
I'm not in this room.

4285
03:11:50,830 --> 03:11:53,510
Said the spooky knife guy, hiding in my closet.

4286
03:11:54,490 --> 03:11:54,930
Scary!

4287
03:11:57,830 --> 03:11:59,770
Thank you so much for the Akasupa.

4288
03:12:00,550 --> 03:12:04,750
I sent Doki my first Akasupa on my birthday a couple days ago to ask her this request.

4289
03:12:04,750 --> 03:12:07,790
Now time to ask my other Kamiyoshi the same thing.

4290
03:12:08,090 --> 03:12:08,850
What do you mean?

4291
03:12:09,470 --> 03:12:12,290
What are some tales you'd be willing to tell us from before you went to heaven?

4292
03:12:12,770 --> 03:12:14,270
And we're an itty-bitty streamer.

4293
03:12:14,490 --> 03:12:15,690
Any favorite memories?

4294
03:12:20,870 --> 03:12:21,910
Favorite memories...

4295
03:12:23,450 --> 03:12:30,250
There was one time I was playing Among Us with chat.

4296
03:12:30,870 --> 03:12:33,750
And I think there was proximity chat too.

4297
03:12:33,750 --> 03:12:36,010
And so I could hear people.

4298
03:12:36,830 --> 03:12:39,550
And there was one person that couldn't hear everybody else.

4299
03:12:39,650 --> 03:12:40,750
I guess it glitched.

4300
03:12:42,750 --> 03:12:49,150
And they were talking to themselves, doing the tasks.

4301
03:12:49,630 --> 03:12:51,690
And one of them was just like...

4302
03:12:51,690 --> 03:12:53,610
The leaves, where you clean up the leaves.

4303
03:12:55,550 --> 03:12:57,750
I still sometimes quote this.

4304
03:12:58,810 --> 03:13:00,470
Even though it was so many years ago.

4305
03:13:00,470 --> 03:13:02,510
They were trying to do the leaves and we were talking to them.

4306
03:13:02,570 --> 03:13:03,910
We were like, hello, can you hear us?

4307
03:13:04,110 --> 03:13:06,870
And they were just talking to themselves and they were like, come on, leaves!

4308
03:13:11,270 --> 03:13:12,450
Come on, leaves!

4309
03:13:13,590 --> 03:13:15,770
Oh my gosh, BHDKillers, you remember!

4310
03:13:15,990 --> 03:13:16,930
I remember this.

4311
03:13:18,010 --> 03:13:19,850
I think in the moment it was so silly.

4312
03:13:20,150 --> 03:13:23,230
Actually, there was another time I thought was so funny.

4313
03:13:23,350 --> 03:13:25,510
I collabed with an old friend, Ayane-chan.

4314
03:13:25,510 --> 03:13:27,850
And she...

4315
03:13:29,570 --> 03:13:32,190
She always had internet issues with me.

4316
03:13:33,850 --> 03:13:39,410
And we were playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

4317
03:13:39,850 --> 03:13:41,410
And I was like doing the wires.

4318
03:13:42,450 --> 03:13:44,970
Or no, I was doing one part and she told me what to do.

4319
03:13:45,050 --> 03:13:46,810
And I was like, okay, Ayane-chan, I'm good.

4320
03:13:47,430 --> 03:13:48,650
I'm gonna go to the next thing.

4321
03:13:48,790 --> 03:13:50,510
And then she was like...

4322
03:13:52,170 --> 03:13:56,730
Release the countdown when there's a 1 in the ending position.

4323
03:13:56,870 --> 03:13:58,950
I was like, Ayane-chan, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

4324
03:14:00,850 --> 03:14:02,150
I'm on to the wires.

4325
03:14:02,850 --> 03:14:04,170
And then it'd be silent.

4326
03:14:05,050 --> 03:14:08,690
And then she'd be like, release when there's a 1.

4327
03:14:09,510 --> 03:14:10,810
It was so silly.

4328
03:14:11,690 --> 03:14:14,490
It was one of my favorite moments that I can think about too.

4329
03:14:16,250 --> 03:14:17,550
Yeah, those are fun.

4330
03:14:17,550 --> 03:14:18,130
And...

4331
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:23,980
I discovered you back then from collabs?

4332
03:14:24,020 --> 03:14:24,300
Really?

4333
03:14:24,860 --> 03:14:25,820
Thank you.

4334
03:14:28,480 --> 03:14:34,220
One of my core memories I had of a young Minto was you laughing so hard at a kettle saying, 本当に?

4335
03:14:34,360 --> 03:14:35,020
and Among Us.

4336
03:14:35,300 --> 03:14:36,420
I don't remember that.

4337
03:14:36,560 --> 03:14:38,560
I do remember playing Among Us with her though.

4338
03:14:40,660 --> 03:14:41,720
Good times.

4339
03:14:42,940 --> 03:14:44,060
Simpler times.

4340
03:14:46,320 --> 03:15:00,520
But I'm glad that I can still do lots of fun collabs and have lots of fun with people now too.

4341
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:04,040
Yeah, it was fun.

4342
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:07,120
Among Us connects us all.

4343
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:15,720
John, welcome to membership.

4344
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:16,760
Thank you.

4345
03:15:17,360 --> 03:15:17,860
Thanks, Minto.

4346
03:15:17,960 --> 03:15:20,700
Also, yes, I consider both you and Doki my Kamiyoshi.

4347
03:15:20,880 --> 03:15:21,980
Fan of the following.

4348
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:25,320
Glad.

4349
03:15:26,460 --> 03:15:27,120
Thank you.

4350
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:33,060
I remember watching early Minto playing Doom 1.

4351
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:39,480
I'm amazed that she was the first person I've ever seen who played it like it was a horror game.

4352
03:15:40,220 --> 03:15:41,760
I gotta play Doom 3.

4353
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:45,300
Really, a real horror game.

4354
03:15:46,180 --> 03:15:48,600
What are your favorite moments that haven't happened yet?

4355
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:54,360
Collab with Metal Gear Solid Konami.

4356
03:15:59,060 --> 03:16:01,000
What if you make a tickle me wisp?

4357
03:16:02,300 --> 03:16:03,700
Have you guys seen that?

4358
03:16:03,760 --> 03:16:05,000
Did you guys see that video?

4359
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:11,560
Where someone hooked up the tickle me Elmo to like this volt power supply.

4360
03:16:12,620 --> 03:16:18,760
Or sorry, this power supply and then they turned it up to like 15 volts or something and he's just like...

4361
03:16:18,760 --> 03:16:21,000
And then he breaks and just goes...

4362
03:16:26,670 --> 03:16:28,670
Oh my gosh, I was in tears.

4363
03:16:28,790 --> 03:16:30,470
My stomach hurts so much.

4364
03:16:32,670 --> 03:16:34,610
Wait, let's... Can we watch it?

4365
03:16:34,670 --> 03:16:36,070
Hold on, I'm gonna get it real quick.

4366
03:16:37,910 --> 03:16:39,470
Wait, can we watch it real quick?

4367
03:16:39,590 --> 03:16:40,190
Oh my gosh.

4368
03:16:40,510 --> 03:16:43,150
I don't want to be a react channel, but it's too funny.

4369
03:16:43,730 --> 03:16:47,550
You guys, it's too funny for me to not share this with the rest of the world.

4370
03:16:48,210 --> 03:16:48,710
Where is it?

4371
03:16:48,730 --> 03:16:49,270
Oh, here we go.

4372
03:16:52,920 --> 03:16:53,700
Oh, hold on.

4373
03:16:53,820 --> 03:16:56,420
I'm gonna change... Sorry, I have my...

4374
03:16:57,380 --> 03:16:59,340
I have my Twitter in light mode.

4375
03:17:02,180 --> 03:17:06,000
So just to save your eyes, I'll go to dark.

4376
03:17:08,680 --> 03:17:10,780
Light mode helps my eyes better, you guys.

4377
03:17:11,680 --> 03:17:14,480
If I'm in dark mode, it like actually messes with my eyes.

4378
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:18,240
Okay.

4379
03:17:18,880 --> 03:17:19,460
Alright, hold on.

4380
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:19,980
Give me a second.

4381
03:17:27,340 --> 03:17:28,400
Give me a second.

4382
03:17:29,260 --> 03:17:30,060
It's too funny.

4383
03:17:30,460 --> 03:17:32,040
It's too funny for me to not share this.

4384
03:17:32,040 --> 03:17:36,420
It's not even this person's, like, video, you know, like...

4385
03:17:36,420 --> 03:17:41,640
They obviously got it from somewhere too, but I'll still leave their credit since I saw it on here.

4386
03:17:42,220 --> 03:17:43,040
Okay, hold on.

4387
03:17:45,700 --> 03:17:46,220
Okay.

4388
03:17:47,380 --> 03:17:50,040
Alright, a little tiny watch along, you guys.

4389
03:17:50,400 --> 03:17:51,820
It's so funny.

4390
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:53,660
I can't.

4391
03:17:53,980 --> 03:17:54,460
I can't.

4392
03:17:54,640 --> 03:17:55,560
It's so funny.

4393
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:56,980
Okay, a little tiny watch along.

4394
03:17:56,980 --> 03:18:01,980
I think the scream was his motors burning up, so the way his bones are screaming...

4395
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:04,940
Okay, this is so funny.

4396
03:18:05,060 --> 03:18:06,020
Okay, here we go.

4397
03:18:06,200 --> 03:18:06,520
Hold on.

4398
03:18:16,410 --> 03:18:19,070
Concept of Tickle Me Elmo is already so funny.

4399
03:18:19,390 --> 03:18:22,450
The way he, like, throws himself back and is just like...

4400
03:18:34,050 --> 03:18:34,950
There he goes.

4401
03:18:37,930 --> 03:18:38,770
He looks...

4402
03:18:39,890 --> 03:18:42,530
The fact is, he's not even smiling.

4403
03:18:42,770 --> 03:18:44,490
It feels like torture.

4404
03:18:45,030 --> 03:18:46,090
Okay, here it comes.

4405
03:18:46,610 --> 03:18:47,650
Here it comes, you guys.

4406
03:18:54,150 --> 03:18:54,910
Oh god.

4407
03:18:55,350 --> 03:18:56,030
Here it comes.

4408
03:19:30,730 --> 03:19:34,610
The way the scream, like, increases...

4409
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:36,610
It doesn't just...

4410
03:19:36,610 --> 03:19:39,070
It just sounds more and more pain.

4411
03:19:39,190 --> 03:19:40,490
It's so bad.

4412
03:19:45,180 --> 03:19:46,820
Oh my god, my stomach hurts.

4413
03:19:46,880 --> 03:19:47,720
It's so good.

4414
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:51,860
Oh god.

4415
03:19:54,750 --> 03:19:56,710
I bought Phantom Thief tickets days ago.

4416
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:58,710
This is the first Btuber concert I'm going.

4417
03:19:59,350 --> 03:20:01,310
I'm happy my first will be with Mint.

4418
03:20:01,370 --> 03:20:01,850
I'm excited.

4419
03:20:01,990 --> 03:20:03,010
Thank you, Blue Pikmin.

4420
03:20:03,170 --> 03:20:03,930
Thank you.

4421
03:20:05,290 --> 03:20:06,090
See you there.

4422
03:20:07,490 --> 03:20:10,090
He could have really used a turbo button.

4423
03:20:12,070 --> 03:20:15,350
Don't even think about using a turbo button.

4424
03:20:15,350 --> 03:20:19,070
Can we get Teco Mimento plugged into a wall?

4425
03:20:19,190 --> 03:20:20,070
That's all I'm asking.

4426
03:20:21,670 --> 03:20:22,670
I gotta go to 15.

4427
03:20:25,430 --> 03:20:27,230
Holy moly, my stomach hurts.

4428
03:20:27,270 --> 03:20:27,790
It's so good.

4429
03:20:28,350 --> 03:20:30,970
Wanted to finish watching the collab, but got paged to work.

4430
03:20:31,090 --> 03:20:32,150
Please haunt my employer.

4431
03:20:32,730 --> 03:20:33,570
I'll haunt.

4432
03:20:33,710 --> 03:20:34,610
I'll possess them.

4433
03:20:35,170 --> 03:20:37,450
Even better, I'll possess them and I'll be like...

4434
03:20:37,450 --> 03:20:39,090
It's Friday everyday!

4435
03:20:42,870 --> 03:20:46,050
That video was really getting me through the day.

4436
03:20:46,190 --> 03:20:47,310
Oh my gosh, it's so funny.

4437
03:20:48,470 --> 03:20:52,810
It's just the way his head goes...

4438
03:21:00,260 --> 03:21:01,380
It's too good.

4439
03:21:01,660 --> 03:21:02,420
So funny.

4440
03:21:05,260 --> 03:21:08,760
If we get to 300k this year, can we please get a Teco Mimento?

4441
03:21:10,940 --> 03:21:12,910
What should we do if I get to 300k?

4442
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:19,660
I've been really bad about all the milestones, huh?

4443
03:21:21,320 --> 03:21:23,800
What should we do if I get to 300k?

4444
03:21:26,860 --> 03:21:30,540
Once you'd be able to play older Ace Combat, I hope you don't get any motion sick.

4445
03:21:31,480 --> 03:21:33,520
Old Ace Combat visuals can be weird at times?

4446
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:34,820
Hopefully not.

4447
03:21:35,080 --> 03:21:35,500
We'll see.

4448
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:43,260
Chat, request karaoke.

4449
03:21:43,560 --> 03:21:44,820
Karaoke is not special.

4450
03:21:48,520 --> 03:21:48,840
Wherefore?

4451
03:21:49,020 --> 03:21:50,580
It's gotta be more special.

4452
03:21:58,290 --> 03:21:58,930
Original song?

4453
03:22:00,090 --> 03:22:02,230
I don't know if it would be done in time.

4454
03:22:02,510 --> 03:22:05,250
If I were to reach it by the end of the year, you know.

4455
03:22:07,490 --> 03:22:10,870
And then... And then if I don't reach it by the end of the year, what do I do?

4456
03:22:10,870 --> 03:22:11,650
Just not release it?

4457
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:18,280
VRChat meet and greet?

4458
03:22:23,290 --> 03:22:24,730
That could be possible.

4459
03:22:26,270 --> 03:22:27,670
VRChat meet and greet, maybe?

4460
03:22:32,340 --> 03:22:34,860
30... 300,000 postcards.

4461
03:22:35,700 --> 03:22:36,980
Oh my gosh, you guys.

4462
03:22:37,060 --> 03:22:39,660
I'm still... Oh, it's actually so bad.

4463
03:22:40,280 --> 03:22:43,280
I'm so behind on the Patreon postcards.

4464
03:22:43,620 --> 03:22:47,240
I still have a month still to sign.

4465
03:22:47,240 --> 03:22:57,100
But I have to do them in such tiny amounts because I think I signed so many postcards within such a short amount of time.

4466
03:22:57,380 --> 03:23:05,340
It actually hurts to sign postcards for so long now.

4467
03:23:05,440 --> 03:23:06,380
It's so bad.

4468
03:23:06,640 --> 03:23:07,860
I feel so awful.

4469
03:23:07,860 --> 03:23:15,380
I try to do, like, 50 a day, but it's so... Oh my gosh.

4470
03:23:16,420 --> 03:23:17,560
Like, I can't.

4471
03:23:17,560 --> 03:23:18,860
I can't do so many now.

4472
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:26,180
I used to be able to just get them out in one huge chunk, but...

4473
03:23:27,220 --> 03:23:29,780
It's... I'm like, no, this is so bad.

4474
03:23:31,080 --> 03:23:32,300
Mentally or carpal tunnel?

4475
03:23:32,380 --> 03:23:33,640
I don't think it's carpal tunnel.

4476
03:23:34,200 --> 03:23:36,800
Because, you know, my hand doesn't hurt all the time.

4477
03:23:37,040 --> 03:23:38,540
It's only when I'm doing the writing.

4478
03:23:39,500 --> 03:23:42,240
So, like, you know, I can use my mouse and everything.

4479
03:23:43,780 --> 03:23:46,320
Maybe it's, like, early onset carpal tunnel.

4480
03:23:47,940 --> 03:23:50,120
My ectoplasm is getting too stiff.

4481
03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:51,100
Oh no.

4482
03:23:53,240 --> 03:23:56,420
So I've definitely learned my lesson with the postcards, too.

4483
03:23:57,360 --> 03:24:00,620
Like, for future, if I were to ever do something like that in the future.

4484
03:24:01,540 --> 03:24:08,320
Also, I feel so awful about all the Patreon stuff from the podcast, because we're so behind.

4485
03:24:08,900 --> 03:24:14,420
Just she, Matara and I, we keep getting, like, more things that keep piling on top of us.

4486
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:19,960
And of course I want to stream, but then I also, I'm like, I need to take care of Patreon things as well.

4487
03:24:20,080 --> 03:24:21,560
So it's just like...

4488
03:24:27,020 --> 03:24:28,360
You're getting old, Minto!

4489
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:29,400
No!

4490
03:24:29,400 --> 03:24:29,780
No!

4491
03:24:31,880 --> 03:24:36,400
I don't think it's that, because, you know, I had to sign, like...

4492
03:24:38,280 --> 03:24:43,400
I signed, like, probably 2,000 cards in, like...

4493
03:24:44,360 --> 03:24:47,060
Like, two weeks one time, you know?

4494
03:24:48,900 --> 03:24:53,500
Like, I brought two months worth of it to Japan with me.

4495
03:24:54,180 --> 03:24:55,400
And I just...

4496
03:24:57,200 --> 03:24:59,720
Like, in... Actually, I think it was about...

4497
03:24:59,720 --> 03:25:02,840
Well, it was definitely 1,000 in, like, three days.

4498
03:25:05,660 --> 03:25:12,680
It was definitely, like, 1,000, because I remember it was when I was in Japan for that really, really long time.

4499
03:25:13,240 --> 03:25:19,480
And I kept getting busy, and also going out and doing stuff, and so I wasn't signing postcards.

4500
03:25:20,080 --> 03:25:21,560
And then Matara was like, OK, I'm coming.

4501
03:25:21,620 --> 03:25:23,160
And I was like, I gotta give these to her.

4502
03:25:23,160 --> 03:25:29,420
And I was like, I was in my room, not going outside, just signing postcards the entire day.

4503
03:25:29,860 --> 03:25:34,860
Just all day, from when I woke up to night, signing postcards.

4504
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:39,520
To get all 1,000 done in time so I could give them to her.

4505
03:25:40,140 --> 03:25:43,900
And it seems like I might have to do the same thing since she's coming over for Thanksgiving.

4506
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:46,080
So, that's so sad.

4507
03:25:46,180 --> 03:25:47,020
No, no, no.

4508
03:25:47,400 --> 03:25:52,320
It was my fault, first of all, because I should have been doing them little bits at a time, but...

4509
03:25:52,320 --> 03:25:57,260
I kept having to move hotels, so I didn't want to...

4510
03:25:57,260 --> 03:26:03,480
I didn't want to open them so much.

4511
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:08,880
Where if I moved hotels, they would get damaged, or they would spill, or stuff like that.

4512
03:26:09,240 --> 03:26:11,400
So I was like, oh, I'll just do them at my last hotel.

4513
03:26:11,900 --> 03:26:14,320
And then by the time I got to my last hotel, I was like...

4514
03:26:16,580 --> 03:26:18,620
Oh gosh, I think I'm in trouble.

4515
03:26:21,220 --> 03:26:22,840
Death note equals click on live.

4516
03:26:23,200 --> 03:26:24,140
Ah, thanks for clicking.

4517
03:26:24,620 --> 03:26:25,460
Thanks for joining.

4518
03:26:26,020 --> 03:26:29,000
We're done with the death note game though, but it was fun.

4519
03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:30,480
You should check it out.

4520
03:26:33,800 --> 03:26:37,300
I know it's Thanksgiving, but having you two do an in-person signing stream would be pretty neat.

4521
03:26:37,780 --> 03:26:38,180
Maybe.

4522
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:40,660
We were thinking about what we could do.

4523
03:26:40,780 --> 03:26:42,160
She wants to play my patchy slot.

4524
03:26:43,600 --> 03:26:44,720
So she'll probably do that.

4525
03:26:45,520 --> 03:26:46,420
Have you tried a wrist brace?

4526
03:26:46,500 --> 03:26:46,980
I have!

4527
03:26:47,260 --> 03:26:47,960
I do have one.

4528
03:26:47,960 --> 03:26:48,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4529
03:26:49,660 --> 03:26:50,940
Always late to everything.

4530
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:51,520
It's okay.

4531
03:26:53,180 --> 03:26:55,120
Did month 4 of the postcard ship?

4532
03:26:56,740 --> 03:26:57,340
Yes.

4533
03:26:58,300 --> 03:26:58,640
Yes.

4534
03:27:01,660 --> 03:27:04,340
I think... I would ask Matara.

4535
03:27:04,860 --> 03:27:06,320
She's the one who handles the shipping.

4536
03:27:09,700 --> 03:27:11,020
She's the one that handles the shipping.

4537
03:27:11,680 --> 03:27:14,540
So I have month 5 and 6 though.

4538
03:27:15,500 --> 03:27:16,500
I believe.

4539
03:27:22,080 --> 03:27:23,440
Do I cook anything?

4540
03:27:23,800 --> 03:27:27,360
Matara says she really wants to try the sweet potato casserole.

4541
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:34,080
I probably will make that.

4542
03:27:34,320 --> 03:27:36,280
And I also make the green bean casserole.

4543
03:27:36,980 --> 03:27:39,260
Those are my specialties.

4544
03:27:39,620 --> 03:27:41,420
Because the green bean casserole is very easy.

4545
03:27:42,160 --> 03:27:44,580
And my mom doesn't trust me with anything else.

4546
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:49,460
My mom doesn't trust me with anything.

4547
03:27:50,200 --> 03:27:52,180
Did you unblock Matara from Twitter?

4548
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:52,620
X.

4549
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:54,940
Is her subathon over?

4550
03:27:55,920 --> 03:27:57,820
Did she finally change her profile picture?

4551
03:27:58,340 --> 03:28:01,100
I love how she was like, I'm gonna block you back.

4552
03:28:01,140 --> 03:28:02,740
And I was like, haha, I'm winning!

4553
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:03,780
I'm winning!

4554
03:28:06,480 --> 03:28:07,080
Alright.

4555
03:28:11,820 --> 03:28:12,420
Matara...

4556
03:28:13,020 --> 03:28:13,760
Oh, no.

4557
03:28:16,160 --> 03:28:16,760
Still...

4558
03:28:17,460 --> 03:28:19,040
Still that profile picture.

4559
03:28:21,880 --> 03:28:23,740
The clock is at 15 hours?

4560
03:28:23,880 --> 03:28:25,460
Oh my gosh, it went up so much.

4561
03:28:28,100 --> 03:28:28,560
Good.

4562
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:29,460
Good.

4563
03:28:31,040 --> 03:28:31,500
Good.

4564
03:28:37,100 --> 03:28:39,140
I'm going to block you and tell Kojima.

4565
03:28:46,280 --> 03:28:48,040
I'll see you when I believe it.

4566
03:28:49,020 --> 03:28:49,420
Oh, wait.

4567
03:28:50,020 --> 03:28:50,620
No, wait.

4568
03:28:54,400 --> 03:28:55,160
Wait, no.

4569
03:28:55,600 --> 03:28:56,880
Wait, the other way around.

4570
03:28:56,980 --> 03:28:58,400
I'll believe it when...

4571
03:29:03,350 --> 03:29:03,910
I'll...

4572
03:29:05,670 --> 03:29:08,070
I'll... I'll see it when I... Wait, no.

4573
03:29:09,290 --> 03:29:11,570
I'll believe it...

4574
03:29:11,570 --> 03:29:12,030
I'll

4575
03:29:15,510 --> 03:29:16,970
believe it when I see it.

4576
03:29:22,580 --> 03:29:24,780
I'm willing things into existence.

4577
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:27,300
I'll believe it when I...

4578
03:29:27,300 --> 03:29:28,160
No, wait a second.

4579
03:29:28,220 --> 03:29:29,060
I see it.

4580
03:29:29,180 --> 03:29:30,940
I see it when I believe it.

4581
03:29:30,940 --> 03:29:32,840
And I'm believing in it right now.

4582
03:29:32,920 --> 03:29:34,340
And it appears in front of me.

4583
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:43,520
Irish wristwatch 2.0

4584
03:29:46,640 --> 03:29:47,940
Holy cow.

4585
03:29:49,200 --> 03:29:49,640
Well...

4586
03:29:54,190 --> 03:29:56,070
Mata's been playing a game that I think you'd like.

4587
03:29:56,150 --> 03:29:57,790
Oh, she messaged me about it earlier.

4588
03:29:57,950 --> 03:30:00,110
The one where it's, like, not Power Wash.

4589
03:30:00,190 --> 03:30:03,390
You, like, dismantle a spaceship.

4590
03:30:03,830 --> 03:30:04,530
Seems fun.

4591
03:30:05,190 --> 03:30:06,310
T-shirt slogan.

4592
03:30:08,350 --> 03:30:09,970
I'll believe it when I... No.

4593
03:30:10,210 --> 03:30:11,650
I'll see it when I believe it.

4594
03:30:13,270 --> 03:30:14,890
And then when people say...

4595
03:30:14,890 --> 03:30:17,910
Then when people say, hey, you got your...

4596
03:30:17,910 --> 03:30:19,530
I'll believe it when I see it.

4597
03:30:19,730 --> 03:30:20,310
No, no.

4598
03:30:20,490 --> 03:30:22,250
You can say, I will...

4599
03:30:22,250 --> 03:30:25,090
I am the master of my own universe.

4600
03:30:25,530 --> 03:30:29,830
I do not let the wheel of fate determine what will happen for me.

4601
03:30:30,450 --> 03:30:33,110
I... When I believe it, I will... Wait.

4602
03:30:34,170 --> 03:30:35,650
When I see it... No.

4603
03:30:35,850 --> 03:30:37,530
When I believe it, I will see it.

4604
03:30:37,690 --> 03:30:40,570
I can't get the... I can't get my own saying right now.

4605
03:30:43,630 --> 03:30:45,510
I can't get my own saying correct.

4606
03:30:48,150 --> 03:30:50,730
See it, believe it, manifest it, make it so.

4607
03:30:52,830 --> 03:30:54,930
It's one of those, like...

4608
03:30:54,930 --> 03:30:56,950
It's one of those...

4609
03:30:58,170 --> 03:31:00,070
Boss... Girl boss...

4610
03:31:00,070 --> 03:31:01,850
Slogans, is what you can say.

4611
03:31:03,410 --> 03:31:06,290
I'll see it when I believe it.

4612
03:31:07,430 --> 03:31:08,030
Datebayo.

4613
03:31:08,510 --> 03:31:09,010
Naruto.

4614
03:31:10,730 --> 03:31:12,130
Sakura, the beautiful.

4615
03:31:12,130 --> 03:31:12,350
Cool.

4616
03:31:17,770 --> 03:31:18,690
Motivational quotes.

4617
03:31:24,050 --> 03:31:25,990
Ace Combat 7 Top Gun DLC.

4618
03:31:26,430 --> 03:31:28,390
I don't know if I actually ever bought it.

4619
03:31:28,990 --> 03:31:29,650
Actually, hold on.

4620
03:31:30,330 --> 03:31:34,010
I wonder... I have Ace Combat 7 on my old account.

4621
03:31:34,130 --> 03:31:35,990
I wonder if it carried over to this one.

4622
03:31:36,090 --> 03:31:37,290
Like, if I can play it on this one.

4623
03:31:38,230 --> 03:31:40,410
Ace Combat, Skies Unknown.

4624
03:31:40,410 --> 03:31:41,430
Oh, I can!

4625
03:31:41,550 --> 03:31:41,810
Good.

4626
03:31:43,370 --> 03:31:43,810
I can.

4627
03:31:44,730 --> 03:31:45,510
If you believe it.

4628
03:31:46,730 --> 03:31:47,670
Believe it!

4629
03:31:47,990 --> 03:31:49,710
Believe it!

4630
03:31:52,510 --> 03:31:53,530
Hi, Cypher.

4631
03:31:54,210 --> 03:31:56,630
Ghost Boss, Gaslight, Grave Keep?

4632
03:31:57,530 --> 03:31:59,070
That's so good!

4633
03:31:59,390 --> 03:32:00,250
Oh my gosh.

4634
03:32:00,510 --> 03:32:02,310
Wait, I'm gonna send that to Mataro right now.

4635
03:32:05,490 --> 03:32:11,410
Ghost Boss, Gaslight, Grave Keep.

4636
03:32:14,370 --> 03:32:15,130
Datebayo.

4637
03:32:16,410 --> 03:32:17,430
Datebayo.

4638
03:32:17,710 --> 03:32:18,530
Datebayo.

4639
03:32:22,890 --> 03:32:24,670
Mataro said send it.

4640
03:32:24,730 --> 03:32:25,330
I love it.

4641
03:32:27,190 --> 03:32:29,070
That's so Mataro-coded.

4642
03:32:29,830 --> 03:32:31,130
That's so good.

4643
03:32:31,190 --> 03:32:31,870
That's so good.

4644
03:32:59,980 --> 03:33:00,460
Mataro.

4645
03:33:07,710 --> 03:33:09,270
Does Mataro like sweet potato?

4646
03:33:09,970 --> 03:33:11,710
Well, she asked for the sweet potato casserole.

4647
03:33:13,410 --> 03:33:16,170
I don't think she would have asked for it otherwise.

4648
03:33:17,810 --> 03:33:19,610
I just noticed the reflection on the table.

4649
03:33:19,830 --> 03:33:22,290
I know, isn't it... I wipe it down everyday.

4650
03:33:22,770 --> 03:33:23,710
It's so squeaky clean.

4651
03:33:25,670 --> 03:33:28,230
You can see... You can even lick... You can...

4652
03:33:30,910 --> 03:33:33,230
You can place your tongue on it, probably.

4653
03:33:38,430 --> 03:33:39,470
On the table.

4654
03:33:40,030 --> 03:33:40,710
You can lick it clean.

4655
03:33:40,790 --> 03:33:41,850
Well, I don't lick it clean.

4656
03:33:42,310 --> 03:33:43,470
It's so clean you can lick it.

4657
03:33:47,750 --> 03:33:48,530
Ghosts have reflections?

4658
03:33:48,630 --> 03:33:49,670
What do you think I am, a vampire?

4659
03:33:53,360 --> 03:33:55,080
I'm a ghost, not a vampire.

4660
03:33:55,800 --> 03:33:56,540
Completely different.

4661
03:33:59,780 --> 03:34:01,900
Do I have a favorite dish for Thanksgiving?

4662
03:34:02,540 --> 03:34:06,060
Probably a sweet potato casserole, but I also really love a green bean casserole.

4663
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:08,180
That's why I always mention those.

4664
03:34:08,280 --> 03:34:08,980
They're my favorites.

4665
03:34:11,040 --> 03:34:14,080
I love green beans, but I hate peas.

4666
03:34:14,600 --> 03:34:16,380
But I love green beans.

4667
03:34:16,580 --> 03:34:17,620
It's so good.

4668
03:34:18,440 --> 03:34:19,280
So yummy.

4669
03:34:22,540 --> 03:34:24,140
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

4670
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:30,180
If you're a ghost, why do you have pointy ears?

4671
03:34:30,180 --> 03:34:31,940
Because I'm a ghost.

4672
03:34:32,800 --> 03:34:34,340
There's different types of ghosts.

4673
03:34:35,020 --> 03:34:36,240
Some ghosts have pointy ears.

4674
03:34:36,760 --> 03:34:40,360
I'm like a supernatural paranormal being.

4675
03:34:43,820 --> 03:34:45,080
Are you the Shinigami?

4676
03:34:45,440 --> 03:34:47,060
No, I'm just a normal ghost.

4677
03:34:48,820 --> 03:34:50,100
I'm just a normal ghost.

4678
03:34:50,140 --> 03:34:50,920
Don't worry about it.

4679
03:34:51,540 --> 03:34:52,300
I'm not Shinigami.

4680
03:34:52,400 --> 03:34:52,940
I won't take you.

4681
03:34:57,960 --> 03:34:59,480
The spirit of Moe.

4682
03:35:01,240 --> 03:35:02,080
Elf ghost?

4683
03:35:02,300 --> 03:35:03,300
No, no, no, no.

4684
03:35:04,180 --> 03:35:05,180
Regular ghost.

4685
03:35:08,910 --> 03:35:11,370
We demand to be called gas sliders.

4686
03:35:13,450 --> 03:35:14,210
Who's we?

4687
03:35:14,610 --> 03:35:15,590
Who's we, huh?

4688
03:35:18,810 --> 03:35:19,910
Who is we?

4689
03:35:27,860 --> 03:35:28,640
You're a ghost, eh?

4690
03:35:28,720 --> 03:35:30,740
I'll see it when I believe it.

4691
03:35:33,160 --> 03:35:34,960
All in favor, say aye.

4692
03:35:35,800 --> 03:35:38,140
Why do you always want to be gas sliders?

4693
03:35:39,680 --> 03:35:41,940
Why I do my turkey is I brine it overnight.

4694
03:35:42,180 --> 03:35:47,320
Then the day, smoke it with my spice blend and herb butter under the skin.

4695
03:35:50,320 --> 03:35:51,900
Herb butter sounds awesome.

4696
03:35:55,770 --> 03:35:57,810
We are always called gas sliders?

4697
03:35:57,950 --> 03:35:58,650
No, you're not.

4698
03:35:59,930 --> 03:36:02,410
Well, I mean, sometimes you lie a little bit.

4699
03:36:04,270 --> 03:36:04,770
But...

4700
03:36:04,770 --> 03:36:06,290
I think...

4701
03:36:07,470 --> 03:36:08,390
I think...

4702
03:36:11,840 --> 03:36:13,040
What do you think about Sadako?

4703
03:36:14,100 --> 03:36:17,220
Sadako is fine, but I love Kayako way more.

4704
03:36:17,760 --> 03:36:20,840
Kayako-sama is my...

4705
03:36:20,840 --> 03:36:22,160
My ghost.

4706
03:36:24,460 --> 03:36:25,800
Kayako from Juon.

4707
03:36:27,540 --> 03:36:29,960
I'm contractually obligated to shill Project Wingman.

4708
03:36:30,600 --> 03:36:33,640
You can fly F-14 and Cute Girls ride with you.

4709
03:36:34,620 --> 03:36:35,680
I saw a game.

4710
03:36:35,720 --> 03:36:36,880
It's actually on my wish list.

4711
03:36:37,400 --> 03:36:37,840
Hold on.

4712
03:36:37,980 --> 03:36:41,260
I saw one earlier that I was like, this is so...

4713
03:36:41,260 --> 03:36:41,660
Hold on.

4714
03:36:41,960 --> 03:36:43,460
Let me get my wish list.

4715
03:36:44,220 --> 03:36:46,760
It's called Tiny Combat Arena.

4716
03:36:48,080 --> 03:36:48,860
Oh my gosh.

4717
03:36:49,160 --> 03:36:49,540
Oh my gosh.

4718
03:36:50,160 --> 03:36:51,280
But it looks so cute.

4719
03:36:52,060 --> 03:36:52,520
Hold on.

4720
03:36:52,680 --> 03:36:53,580
Has anybody played this?

4721
03:36:53,620 --> 03:36:55,180
It has very positive reviews.

4722
03:36:56,120 --> 03:36:56,620
Hold on.

4723
03:37:01,250 --> 03:37:01,990
Hold on.

4724
03:37:06,900 --> 03:37:08,280
Hold on, I'm bringing it up.

4725
03:37:14,950 --> 03:37:16,470
Has anyone played this before?

4726
03:37:17,330 --> 03:37:18,550
Tiny Combat Arena.

4727
03:37:25,400 --> 03:37:26,540
It's so cute.

4728
03:37:26,880 --> 03:37:27,660
Look at it.

4729
03:37:27,740 --> 03:37:28,960
They're like low-poly planes.

4730
03:37:30,820 --> 03:37:31,720
And you dogfight.

4731
03:37:32,180 --> 03:37:32,760
Look at that.

4732
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:35,060
It actually looks so good even for low-poly.

4733
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:37,860
It's so cute though, right?

4734
03:37:42,380 --> 03:37:43,560
I saw it.

4735
03:37:43,620 --> 03:37:44,840
It's been on my wish list for a bit.

4736
03:37:45,280 --> 03:37:46,280
I haven't grabbed it yet.

4737
03:37:53,780 --> 03:37:54,960
The little parachute.

4738
03:37:55,080 --> 03:37:56,880
Oh my god, that almost hit the guy in the parachute.

4739
03:37:57,360 --> 03:37:58,880
You're a tiny combat arena.

4740
03:37:59,060 --> 03:37:59,940
Yeah, I am.

4741
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:03,080
It looks cool though.

4742
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:05,540
I was like, it's just low-poly-aced combat.

4743
03:38:06,360 --> 03:38:07,100
Love this.

4744
03:38:10,500 --> 03:38:12,000
Yeah, I thought it looked fun.

4745
03:38:12,240 --> 03:38:14,820
The price is a little steep.

4746
03:38:15,100 --> 03:38:17,140
It's 20 dollars, 20 USD.

4747
03:38:17,900 --> 03:38:20,760
Which is why I didn't grab it.

4748
03:38:20,840 --> 03:38:23,080
Wait, Microprose Harrier Bundle.

4749
03:38:24,680 --> 03:38:25,400
What's that?

4750
03:38:25,560 --> 03:38:26,240
Okay, hold on.

4751
03:38:31,040 --> 03:38:31,920
But, yeah.

4752
03:38:32,740 --> 03:38:33,880
That's why I didn't get it yet.

4753
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:38,080
I was like, it's in early access and it's a little pricey, but...

4754
03:38:42,660 --> 03:38:46,840
I usually ignore any games that aren't reviewed by game critics, but that's a personal thing.

4755
03:38:47,420 --> 03:38:50,640
But you're gonna miss out on so many things, I feel, right?

4756
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:53,920
If you only stick with the game critics.

4757
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:57,960
You miss out on so many fun indie games and things.

4758
03:39:01,080 --> 03:39:03,340
Microsoft Flight Sim Stream for 300k?

4759
03:39:03,780 --> 03:39:06,060
We fly all the way to Japan!

4760
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:09,940
I have been meaning to do that.

4761
03:39:15,260 --> 03:39:17,700
You spent 300 dollars on 4 cups yesterday.

4762
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:19,340
I didn't think you cared about pricey.

4763
03:39:19,340 --> 03:39:24,660
That was a very rare moment of me being...

4764
03:39:24,660 --> 03:39:27,240
I'm actually quite frugal, I promise.

4765
03:39:27,580 --> 03:39:29,340
Somewhere Nan sneezes.

4766
03:39:30,280 --> 03:39:31,020
Nan is here!

4767
03:39:32,240 --> 03:39:33,180
Play video games.

4768
03:39:33,760 --> 03:39:35,100
Play the video games.

4769
03:39:40,130 --> 03:39:41,930
The history about the JPEG dog?

4770
03:39:43,270 --> 03:39:45,430
Like how it's the dev's dog?

4771
03:39:49,940 --> 03:39:51,680
Hide that Blue Archive account?

4772
03:39:51,680 --> 03:39:54,680
I don't spend that much on Blue Archive, what are you talking about?

4773
03:39:55,300 --> 03:39:58,300
I spend 10 dollars a month on Blue Archive and that's it.

4774
03:39:59,960 --> 03:40:03,280
I spend 10 dollars a month on Blue Archive.

4775
03:40:03,980 --> 03:40:06,960
And I actually haven't even been doing that because I've been...

4776
03:40:06,960 --> 03:40:09,720
I've been really bad about Blue Archive recently.

4777
03:40:10,400 --> 03:40:13,200
You guys, I haven't been playing so much.

4778
03:40:13,860 --> 03:40:15,180
I'm a bad sensei.

4779
03:40:17,480 --> 03:40:19,580
I'm a bad sensei!

4780
03:40:20,940 --> 03:40:23,040
Shiroko Terror is coming, I know!

4781
03:40:29,500 --> 03:40:31,640
I got Kirara, she's so cute.

4782
03:40:31,900 --> 03:40:32,960
Oh my god, she's so cute.

4783
03:40:36,510 --> 03:40:37,890
I want Bunny Toki.

4784
03:40:38,470 --> 03:40:40,870
I have regular Toki, I don't have Bunny Toki.

4785
03:40:42,350 --> 03:40:45,870
But I got regular Toki like very...

4786
03:40:45,870 --> 03:40:47,650
I didn't realize she was a unique unit.

4787
03:40:47,930 --> 03:40:50,090
I got her...

4788
03:40:50,090 --> 03:40:54,550
Fairly easily, she was like one of my first 3 stars.

4789
03:41:03,860 --> 03:41:05,340
She hates her students.

4790
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:09,080
I still trust you with the financials boss.

4791
03:41:09,480 --> 03:41:12,360
I promise, I promise I'm not that bad.

4792
03:41:13,300 --> 03:41:14,840
Will you ever do a Blue Archive stream?

4793
03:41:15,940 --> 03:41:16,780
What about me?

4794
03:41:16,920 --> 03:41:18,080
What would I do though?

4795
03:41:19,400 --> 03:41:20,420
What would I do?

4796
03:41:20,420 --> 03:41:25,320
But also, I play Blue Archive, it's like on my phone, right?

4797
03:41:25,420 --> 03:41:26,800
It's like my personal phone.

4798
03:41:27,060 --> 03:41:28,420
I guess if I...

4799
03:41:29,300 --> 03:41:31,480
If I installed it...

4800
03:41:31,480 --> 03:41:33,420
Maybe like...

4801
03:41:36,090 --> 03:41:37,790
Maybe if I installed it...

4802
03:41:38,730 --> 03:41:41,370
And used my account like on a separate thing.

4803
03:41:45,880 --> 03:41:47,640
If I did an emulator...

4804
03:41:48,460 --> 03:41:50,520
Would I be able to log into my account?

4805
03:41:51,700 --> 03:41:53,800
Or would I have to make a new account?

4806
03:41:56,440 --> 03:41:58,160
Because I'm not going to start over.

4807
03:41:58,580 --> 03:41:59,400
You can, really?

4808
03:42:05,580 --> 03:42:09,480
No, I don't want to mirror my phone screen because like I said, it's my personal phone.

4809
03:42:10,860 --> 03:42:14,800
Like, that's why I was like if I put it on like something that I...

4810
03:42:14,800 --> 03:42:17,040
That wouldn't accidentally get a notification.

4811
03:42:17,640 --> 03:42:20,340
And it's just like, here's your mom's phone number.

4812
03:42:22,540 --> 03:42:23,780
I'm like...

4813
03:42:23,780 --> 03:42:27,780
Care to share your sensei troubles and gush about your favorite students?

4814
03:42:28,200 --> 03:42:29,280
I like Toki and Saori.

4815
03:42:30,420 --> 03:42:32,260
And we don't talk about swimsuit Hanako.

4816
03:42:33,360 --> 03:42:37,480
I love Koharu, I love Cherino, and I love Hina.

4817
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:40,000
Those are my top three.

4818
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:44,400
Probably in that order even.

4819
03:42:45,140 --> 03:42:46,620
My JPEG dog recipes.

4820
03:42:46,900 --> 03:42:48,260
Yeah, so sad.

4821
03:42:53,600 --> 03:42:56,640
But actually I have to say I like Shimiko too.

4822
03:42:57,920 --> 03:42:59,960
Because Shimiko is...

4823
03:43:00,920 --> 03:43:02,300
My sister kind of.

4824
03:43:02,900 --> 03:43:07,480
Oh and I also love Shiroko because Shiroko is voiced by my seiyuu Oshi.

4825
03:43:08,420 --> 03:43:09,620
My seiyuu Kamiyoshi.

4826
03:43:11,340 --> 03:43:12,260
Ogura Yui.

4827
03:43:13,500 --> 03:43:14,540
Which club would you join?

4828
03:43:19,860 --> 03:43:21,160
The game club.

4829
03:43:26,860 --> 03:43:27,320
Yeah.

4830
03:43:28,780 --> 03:43:31,040
Spend a stream reading Momotalks?

4831
03:43:31,060 --> 03:43:33,380
I think I have like 30 Momotalks, I'm not gonna lie.

4832
03:43:33,760 --> 03:43:34,160
Let's see.

4833
03:43:34,580 --> 03:43:35,500
I'm gonna log in today.

4834
03:43:36,620 --> 03:43:37,320
Let's see.

4835
03:43:37,480 --> 03:43:38,220
Blue Archive.

4836
03:43:38,480 --> 03:43:39,840
Blue Archive!

4837
03:43:41,060 --> 03:43:45,240
Just found out a few days ago that they made campaign missions much easier now.

4838
03:43:45,340 --> 03:43:49,540
Instead of multiple battles with two squads you can just do one run best kill.

4839
03:43:49,740 --> 03:43:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4840
03:43:54,040 --> 03:43:55,200
I'm over a hundred.

4841
03:43:55,480 --> 03:43:57,500
I go through them... Oh, I have an update.

4842
03:43:58,020 --> 03:43:59,400
I go through them pretty...

4843
03:44:02,840 --> 03:44:06,220
Not so often, but often enough I'd say.

4844
03:44:07,240 --> 03:44:09,340
Because I like collecting the recollections.

4845
03:44:11,300 --> 03:44:13,420
I like seeing the recollections.

4846
03:44:20,200 --> 03:44:22,300
Usually after the recollections I always stop.

4847
03:44:22,380 --> 03:44:23,960
Unless it's a character I really care about.

4848
03:44:23,960 --> 03:44:26,780
Is Blue Archive easy to get into?

4849
03:44:26,880 --> 03:44:27,600
I'd say so.

4850
03:44:27,660 --> 03:44:28,480
It's not so bad.

4851
03:44:32,730 --> 03:44:33,830
Started a couple weeks ago.

4852
03:44:33,910 --> 03:44:34,810
I love my starter Hina.

4853
03:44:34,970 --> 03:44:36,410
She's so cute, isn't she?

4854
03:44:38,510 --> 03:44:39,690
No phone streaming.

4855
03:44:39,990 --> 03:44:40,230
Yep.

4856
03:44:41,730 --> 03:44:42,730
I won't be.

4857
03:44:44,350 --> 03:44:47,150
Idol Mari, Sakurako, and Minai look so cute.

4858
03:44:47,470 --> 03:44:48,630
They even have an in-game song.

4859
03:44:49,070 --> 03:44:50,490
Won't be in Global for half a year sadly.

4860
03:44:50,650 --> 03:44:55,110
Yeah, but honestly half a year is not even so bad...

4861
03:44:55,110 --> 03:44:59,150
Compared to some other games that are like crazy.

4862
03:45:00,410 --> 03:45:02,150
Yeah, I have all three Hinas too!

4863
03:45:05,310 --> 03:45:06,610
Love Hina.

4864
03:45:07,550 --> 03:45:08,790
I love Hoshino too.

4865
03:45:09,850 --> 03:45:14,730
Hoshino, Shiroko, Hina, Sherry no Koharu.

4866
03:45:17,890 --> 03:45:18,370
Yay!

4867
03:45:20,590 --> 03:45:21,330
Hold on.

4868
03:45:21,470 --> 03:45:24,290
Oh my gosh.

4869
03:45:24,570 --> 03:45:26,250
Sorry, Justice Task Force.

4870
03:45:26,650 --> 03:45:26,810
Oops.

4871
03:45:29,390 --> 03:45:30,090
Arona's Daily.

4872
03:45:30,150 --> 03:45:31,210
Oh, I love Arona too.

4873
03:45:32,270 --> 03:45:33,970
Three year anniversary stuff.

4874
03:45:34,110 --> 03:45:35,350
Oh gosh, I didn't even notice.

4875
03:45:36,850 --> 03:45:38,890
It's been a couple days since I've logged in.

4876
03:45:39,930 --> 03:45:41,430
What was I logging in for?

4877
03:45:41,750 --> 03:45:43,050
Oh, my Momotalks.

4878
03:45:43,190 --> 03:45:44,090
Yeah, I have 33.

4879
03:45:44,090 --> 03:45:44,190
33.

4880
03:45:47,070 --> 03:45:48,390
Not so much.

4881
03:45:56,550 --> 03:45:56,930
Koharu...

4882
03:46:00,390 --> 03:46:01,150
Speak.

4883
03:46:11,430 --> 03:46:13,910
Minto is Arona, Lilac is Plana.

4884
03:46:13,910 --> 03:46:14,710
Whoa!

4885
03:46:16,470 --> 03:46:18,230
Show yourself to cute games, you goofy ghost.

4886
03:46:18,270 --> 03:46:18,630
Stop!

4887
03:46:19,830 --> 03:46:21,370
Airborne Ninja, thank you!

4888
03:46:24,490 --> 03:46:25,270
Thank you!

4889
03:46:25,850 --> 03:46:26,670
Oh my gosh.

4890
03:46:27,210 --> 03:46:28,070
Thank you for the Akatsuba.

4891
03:46:30,530 --> 03:46:31,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4892
03:46:32,470 --> 03:46:33,470
My ojisan is showing.

4893
03:46:38,010 --> 03:46:40,230
What other Momotalks do I even have?

4894
03:46:40,250 --> 03:46:40,710
Let's see.

4895
03:46:40,710 --> 03:46:45,670
Koyuki, Misaki, Momiji, Hasumi, track version.

4896
03:46:46,090 --> 03:46:46,950
Ako, dress version.

4897
03:46:47,710 --> 03:46:49,710
Ako's dress version...

4898
03:46:50,690 --> 03:46:51,450
Her...

4899
03:46:51,450 --> 03:46:53,210
Actually, Ako...

4900
03:46:53,210 --> 03:46:55,010
Her recollections are so spicy.

4901
03:46:55,610 --> 03:46:56,790
Haruna, track version.

4902
03:46:56,870 --> 03:46:58,170
Hoshino, swimsuit version.

4903
03:46:58,730 --> 03:47:02,170
Ichika, Iroha, Kasumi, Kikyo, Mako, Tomeru.

4904
03:47:03,070 --> 03:47:04,930
Renge, Rumi, Wakamo.

4905
03:47:06,730 --> 03:47:10,090
Those are the Momotalks I have right now.

4906
03:47:11,830 --> 03:47:13,450
I actually just got the temple.

4907
03:47:17,110 --> 03:47:19,730
I want to... I want Kirara, but...

4908
03:47:19,730 --> 03:47:21,790
I wonder if the temple will last...

4909
03:47:21,790 --> 03:47:23,710
Or the temple ticket will last for...

4910
03:47:25,330 --> 03:47:26,830
How long does it last for?

4911
03:47:27,990 --> 03:47:29,530
When does it expire?

4912
03:47:30,290 --> 03:47:32,050
Does it expire before Shiroko Terror?

4913
03:48:08,570 --> 03:48:10,850
The ones from mail don't expire.

4914
03:48:10,970 --> 03:48:11,910
Oh, just save it then.

4915
03:48:21,580 --> 03:48:25,140
My computer is back to doing the normal clicking that it usually does.

4916
03:48:29,660 --> 03:48:31,800
It's okay, sort of.

4917
03:48:36,120 --> 03:48:39,500
Wait, why are all the stickers in Korean?

4918
03:48:40,100 --> 03:48:40,860
What happened?

4919
03:48:41,320 --> 03:48:42,000
Oh my gosh.

4920
03:48:42,780 --> 03:48:43,720
Blue archive.

4921
03:48:50,960 --> 03:48:53,120
Stretch everybody, stretch.

4922
03:48:54,120 --> 03:48:55,540
Make sure you stretch.

4923
03:48:57,200 --> 03:48:58,840
I'm starting to get sleepy.

4924
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:02,880
Tomorrow will probably be a long, long, long, long, long, long...

4925
03:49:03,860 --> 03:49:07,200
Long, long, long, long stream, so...

4926
03:49:07,200 --> 03:49:10,560
I should go prepare for that by sleeping.

4927
03:49:12,760 --> 03:49:14,720
And looking at my fan.

4928
03:49:16,540 --> 03:49:17,820
What's the Minecraft stream?

4929
03:49:17,820 --> 03:49:24,560
It's Doki and I playing Minecraft Hardcore until we beat Minecraft Hardcore.

4930
03:49:24,820 --> 03:49:26,560
We have to beat it together.

4931
03:49:26,940 --> 03:49:27,660
We can't die.

4932
03:49:28,700 --> 03:49:30,300
We have to beat the Ender Dragon.

4933
03:49:33,840 --> 03:49:35,440
Hardcore style.

4934
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:39,100
So...

4935
03:49:39,500 --> 03:49:42,820
We'll see what happens.

4936
03:49:43,300 --> 03:49:44,160
Oh gosh.

4937
03:49:44,160 --> 03:49:44,400
Oh gosh.

4938
03:49:46,180 --> 03:49:48,180
We'll see how long that takes.

4939
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:53,180
I wanna do some research, like...

4940
03:49:53,180 --> 03:49:57,240
So like, this is how you play Minecraft Hardcore if you wanna beat it.

4941
03:49:57,800 --> 03:49:59,480
I'm gonna do a tiny bit of research.

4942
03:50:00,880 --> 03:50:02,680
I'm looking forward to that stream more than Christmas.

4943
03:50:02,940 --> 03:50:03,260
Stop!

4944
03:50:04,680 --> 03:50:06,060
I believe in you guys.

4945
03:50:06,320 --> 03:50:07,020
Okay, right, snap.

4946
03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:08,540
Thank you.

4947
03:50:10,620 --> 03:50:11,920
We'll be here for a month.

4948
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:12,320
No!

4949
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:16,720
You start with armor.

4950
03:50:17,420 --> 03:50:17,680
Okay.

4951
03:50:19,960 --> 03:50:21,740
Let me say something nice.

4952
03:50:25,640 --> 03:50:26,400
Stop it.

4953
03:50:26,440 --> 03:50:28,580
When you guys are wholesome, I'm not used to it.

4954
03:50:29,440 --> 03:50:29,740
Okay.

4955
03:50:30,460 --> 03:50:32,280
Thanks for the collab and this fun and cozy Zatsu.

4956
03:50:32,500 --> 03:50:32,740
Yeah!

4957
03:50:33,460 --> 03:50:42,200
Thanks for hanging out with me while we wound down after that chaotic collab of mind games and brainwaves.

4958
03:50:42,200 --> 03:50:44,320
This is fun.

4959
03:50:45,380 --> 03:50:46,260
Thank you guys.

4960
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:47,800
Otsumito!

4961
03:50:49,020 --> 03:50:51,540
Have a good night.

4962
03:50:51,980 --> 03:50:53,640
If I see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow.

4963
03:50:53,800 --> 03:50:57,200
If I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see you whenever I see you.

4964
03:50:58,900 --> 03:50:59,420
Otsumito!

4965
03:50:59,420 --> 03:50:59,940
Otsumito!

4966
03:51:00,660 --> 03:51:01,180
Itterasshai!

4967
03:51:01,920 --> 03:51:02,700
Thank you guys.

4968
03:51:03,020 --> 03:51:04,120
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4969
03:51:05,420 --> 03:51:08,520
I needed to cleanse the energy today so please accept this.

4970
03:51:09,200 --> 03:51:10,260
Thank you Suika!

4971
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:15,500
When you play Ace Combat 7, I will tell you the history.

4972
03:51:15,800 --> 03:51:16,060
Yeah!

4973
03:51:16,740 --> 03:51:17,600
Thank you!

4974
03:51:19,280 --> 03:51:19,880
Otsumito!

4975
03:51:20,560 --> 03:51:21,420
Bye bye!

4976
03:51:21,720 --> 03:51:23,380
Bye bye, haunt you later.

4977
03:51:26,160 --> 03:51:27,160
Bye bye!
