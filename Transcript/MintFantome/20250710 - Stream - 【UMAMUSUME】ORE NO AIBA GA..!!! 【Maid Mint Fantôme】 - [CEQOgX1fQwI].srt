1
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,990
Yeah.

2
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,830
Hello everybody.

3
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:51,410
I mean... I mean... Oh no.

4
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,530
Hold on.

5
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,100
You

6
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,370
can do better than that!

7
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,410
These are definitely...

8
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,050
Definitely... Horse ears and not repurposed bunny ears.

9
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,690
Okay, everybody?

10
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,870
Please understand.

11
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,810
That was a good attempt.

12
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,430
It's going to elephant.

13
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,150
I can be a horse girl.

14
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,590
You can feed me carrots and scratch my nose.

15
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,310
Feed me carrots!

16
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,010
Please!

17
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,160
The horses are bunnies of the earth.

18
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:01,460
Yeah.

19
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
Bunnies are in space.

20
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,180
They are not on earth.

21
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Everybody knows that.

22
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,360
Bunnies are on the moon.

23
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,980
The horses are on the moon.

24
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,060
Anyway... Welcome to Mamosume!

25
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:25,520
Um... I also... I also wanted to... Um... I also wanted to... Play...

26
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,480
Everybody else is playing!

27
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,520
And it's like the one time... I feel... I already was a little late...

28
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,600
Because I was in Japan.

29
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,480
And now everybody's playing.

30
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,680
And I was like... Well... Everybody's getting into it.

31
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,900
I feel FOMO if I don't.

32
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,560
Of course FOMO.

33
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,680
Yeah, exactly.

34
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,820
Yeah, exactly.

35
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,680
My ex... My experience with Umamusume is I just watched the first season.

36
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,900
So I've never played the game before.

37
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,660
And, uh... Um... Yeah.

38
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,400
So... I'm excited.

39
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,840
Was that Top Gun?

40
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,480
I feel like I should like Top Gun.

41
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,540
Because of her name.

42
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,100
But I know everybody likes Gold Ship.

43
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,260
Not even the JP version.

44
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,820
No!

45
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,620
Actually, I don't usually play... Games... Unless they're localized.

46
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,880
I'll be honest.

47
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,600
Because... I don't know.

48
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,360
I want to... Especially with the UI of Umamusume.

49
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,420
Every time I would see it, I would become so... Uh... So... Overwhelmed.

50
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,040
I was like... Uh... I... I think I'm lost!

51
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,460
So... The game is really hard in JP.

52
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,120
It's a lot of like... What's the word?

53
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,880
It's almost... It almost feels like a... Kind of a Tokimeki Memorial... Situation.

54
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,300
Where you have to... Like, train your stats.

55
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,440
And...

56
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,700
Musakashi!

57
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,120
Uh... It's too difficult for me.

58
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,420
The announcers are so fast, too.

59
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:03,820
Oh, yeah.

60
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,800
Gives Carrot.

61
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,360
Thank you!

62
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
If you're a horse, can we ride it?

63
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:09,800
No!

64
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,220
Can you ride the Umamusume?

65
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:11,700
No!

66
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,660
They are freedom.

67
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
Like Gakumash.

68
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,480
Yeah!

69
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,680
Yeah, so... Usually, I'm not... I don't play games unless they're in... English.

70
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,300
Yeeha!

71
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,320
Right, Shower.

72
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,380
Yeah, I've seen her being...

73
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,200
Being... Being... Very...

74
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Beloved by people...

75
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,500
On Twitter.

76
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,240
Mayano.

77
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,720
Top Gun.

78
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,280
Best Horse.

79
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,800
Gold Ship.

80
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,580
Fans are wrong.

81
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:38,860
Oh!

82
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,180
No!

83
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,280
We're not starting...

84
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,460
Girl Wars here!

85
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,880
We're not starting Horse Wars!

86
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,520
Stop!

87
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,660
What?

88
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,740
Does... Does nobody care about Special Week?

89
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
She was the main character.

90
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,600
No, I've never... I haven't seen a single person even mention Special Week.

91
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,900
Her... Oh!

92
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
And then, Teyo.

93
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
I like her, too, because she's voiced by Machiko.

94
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,800
And Silent Suzuka.

95
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,070
Who?

96
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,110
Don't say who!

97
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,010
Yeah, Teyo's really good.

98
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,910
She was one of my favorites from the show.

99
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,330
I liked her and El Condor Pasa.

100
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,130
So I'm really... Curious...

101
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,950
Who will be my favorite...

102
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,350
I like... Right now, I like McQueen.

103
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,770
Meijiro McQueen.

104
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,970
But I'm really curious who will be my...

105
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,150
Who will be my...

106
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,770
Who will win my heart.

107
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,130
There's so many girls!

108
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,010
So...

109
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,670
We'll see.

110
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,290
It might not be...

111
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,050
Immediate.

112
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,950
But it could be love at first sight.

113
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,570
Who knows.

114
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,070
Kerchow!

115
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,700
Oh!

116
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
I made some tea.

117
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,940
Will you guys help me?

118
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,500
I feel like one thing that I don't do enough while I'm streaming is drink...

119
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,720
Water.

120
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,420
So...

121
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,620
I have a little...

122
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,040
Drinky...

123
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,800
Emote.

124
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,160
You guys will just sometimes post that and be like...

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,700
I need to drink water.

126
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,000
Hydrate.

127
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,160
Yeah!

128
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,820
I have a water here.

129
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,900
And I have tea.

130
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,500
And this tea is special throat tea.

131
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,060
That my mama got me from Germany.

132
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,840
So...

133
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,540
Yeah!

134
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah, yeah!

135
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,780
Drinky drink!

136
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,540
That's bubble tea though.

137
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Maybe I should update it.

138
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,240
I thought I got a drinking emote.

139
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,840
Do I not?

140
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,680
Like a sippy?

141
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,660
Am I crazy?

142
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,280
Am I thinking of...

143
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,640
Maybe I'm thinking of a past life.

144
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,560
They say you can lead a horse mid to water, but you can't make her drink.

145
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:00,980
Perhaps.

146
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,680
Am I thinking of another time?

147
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,080
Maybe before I was a ghost.

148
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,520
When I was alive.

149
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
I don't see one.

150
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,620
Me neither!

151
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,180
I completely made it up in my head!

152
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,520
Wait!

153
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,480
I actually made it up in my head.

154
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,420
I was like...

155
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,700
Oh, I'll just have people...

156
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,360
I have a drink, but it's bubble tea!

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,760
I'm not drinking bubble tea all the time!

158
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,760
Choo choo!

159
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,500
Cowabunga!

160
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,480
Running a race in a dress doesn't seem very aerodynamic.

161
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,800
Perhaps they would be faster in body suits.

162
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,920
Now, wouldn't you like to see that?

163
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
Anyway, should we start?

164
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,020
I didn't make an account yet or anything, so I...

165
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,160
I...

166
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,040
I...

167
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,020
I, like, downloaded it.

168
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,440
Like, the game, obviously.

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,940
But then there was, like, a download...

170
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,780
You know how...

171
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,540
Gacha Game are.

172
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,500
And I downloaded that, but then it started a cutscene, and I was like, Wait.

173
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,180
I wanna watch this...

174
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,220
On stream.

175
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,120
I think.

176
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,060
So...

177
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,520
It uses your Steam account.

178
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,140
Oh, really?

179
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,740
All horses are best horse, but my favorite is...

180
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,320
Manhattan Cafe!

181
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,640
Yes.

182
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,540
I know.

183
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
That is Ogura Yui.

184
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,720
And, um...

185
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,240
Did you guys know that...

186
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,900
Um...

187
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,240
Famous Annie Song singer, Asaka...

188
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,780
Who just happened to, uh...

189
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,720
Follow me...

190
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,020
On Monday...

191
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,080
Um...

192
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,720
She also is at...

193
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,120
Umamushime...

194
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,080
Entering the starting gate...

195
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,880
Oh, okay, yeah.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,800
This is what I was playing.

197
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,440
Umamushime...

198
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,300
What if one of them doesn't want to run?

199
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,740
There should be, like, a Umamushime who's like, no.

200
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm breaking free.

201
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm gonna start...

202
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,880
I wanna...

203
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,960
I wanna do crimes!

204
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
What if she wants to do horse crimes?

205
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,720
I don't know.

206
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,560
I don't know.

207
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:20,580
I don't know.

208
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,120
They will continue to run.

209
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,520
They become glue!

210
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,000
They become glue!

211
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
And then we eat them!

212
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,460
Nineto, Nineto!

213
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,360
Chuuu!

214
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,220
Chuuu!

215
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,860
This game is peak.

216
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,640
Thank you!

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
One day at the Tokyo race course...

218
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,160
The new trainer!

219
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,000
Here!

220
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,460
Okay, when I first heard her voice...

221
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,760
For, like, a very brief second...

222
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,080
I heard Marin.

223
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,540
Like, Kosho Marin.

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,280
Like, maybe her mom.

225
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,340
You know?

226
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,800
It sounded like her just...

227
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,180
Just, like, a little bit.

228
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,920
I heard it.

229
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
And she's only in that part.

230
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,520
From here on, she doesn't...

231
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,600
She doesn't sound like her.

232
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,380
Only when she was yelling at me.

233
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,620
I heard it.

234
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,940
You hear it a bit.

235
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Maybe a little.

236
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,420
Do you guys want me to narrate this?

237
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,940
Or is it okay with just...

238
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,300
Nihongo?

239
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,740
Nihongo good?

240
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,040
He's okay?

241
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,520
You don't have to?

242
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,880
JP voice is okay?

243
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,760
Lucky!

244
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,700
Save my voice.

245
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,260
Thank you.

246
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,400
Okay.

247
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,080
So, how's the volume?

248
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,640
Tazuna Hayakawa.

249
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,760
Hayakawa Tazuna desu!

250
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,120
Thank you for bringing me on board!

251
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,700
I like this green woman.

252
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,670
Thank you, Paige!

253
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,790
Hey, kids!

254
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,290
Oh, sorry!

255
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,770
I see, text I read!

256
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,390
First of all, let's watch the race from the beginning of this.

257
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,630
Oh, let's watch it!

258
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,250
Can you hear me?

259
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,310
This great完成!

260
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,150
I hear it.

261
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,830
They're cheering... for her!

262
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,330
The horse!

263
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,370
Horse!

264
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:46,990
Horse!

265
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:47,830
Horse!

266
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:48,550
Woo!

267
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,670
We don't love the people in the world, but we will競い合うレース.

268
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,110
At this point, yeah, people from all around the world do adore the Umamusume Racing.

269
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,950
That was abrupt.

270
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,070
Oh my gosh, the little Daiwa...

271
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:22,990
11th?

272
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,110
We'll get that higher.

273
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,970
Yeah, see, special week.

274
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,270
I've never heard of Grass Wonder.

275
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,830
Oh, this is the girl that every...

276
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,590
Oh, it's the song.

277
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,310
She looks...

278
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,170
I've never heard of so many of these girls.

279
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,650
I know everybody likes Urara right now.

280
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,470
You're trying to narrate everything, it'll be two hours before you do your first race.

281
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,310
Okay, but...

282
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,790
Well, now, right now we're racing.

283
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:11,980
Finale?

284
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm not ready.

285
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,740
I gotta get my running legs.

286
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,060
Urara.

287
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,120
Special week!

288
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,880
Tails!

289
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
She's so cute.

290
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,940
This is the second one.

291
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,900
Yes, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,140
Oh my god.

293
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:47,740
Sorry.

294
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,100
Oh, oh, oh.

295
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,240
Oh, oh.

296
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,900
Oh my god.

297
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,380
Sorry.

298
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,100
She's going?

299
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,200
Grasswander.

300
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,540
What a name.

301
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,840
Is this... I'm guessing it's... scripted?

302
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,580
Right?

303
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,940
Oh my gosh, she's going so fast.

304
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,920
Holy cow, I can't keep up.

305
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,480
This race is... yeah, okay, yeah.

306
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh my god.

307
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,500
She doesn't shut up.

308
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,860
Let this woman breathe!

309
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,860
Oh my god!

310
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,280
Holy cow!

311
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,440
Wow!

312
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,400
The narrator... the announcer is just as fast as the... almost.

313
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm overwhelmed!

314
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,920
Oh, Urara.

315
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,860
Don't look at her position.

316
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,660
Oh my god!

317
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,100
Oh my god!

318
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,920
All alone!

319
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,400
That's so sad!

320
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,140
That's so sad!

321
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,220
Woo!

322
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,390
Oh my god, I like the sound of their feet.

323
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,050
Oh my god, Top Gun's outfit is so cute too.

324
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,810
Oh...

325
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,430
Special Week!

326
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,190
Winner, winner!

327
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,910
Out of the glue dinner!

328
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,590
Oh yeah...

329
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,310
Live!

330
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,030
Oh, what?

331
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,910
We don't get a performance?

332
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,170
Wait, we do get a performance, right?

333
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,930
What the hell?

334
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,110
What is this like...

335
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,730
240p picture?

336
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,090
Oh...

337
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,150
Not yet!

338
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,770
But I wanna see!

339
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,250
Soon!

340
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,550
I wish there was an auto... I think this skips, no?

341
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,330
I wish there was auto mode.

342
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,550
I see...

343
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,330
Oh!

344
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,770
Okay...

345
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,510
I'm excited.

346
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,990
Get my pen lights out.

347
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,750
Okay...

348
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,950
I'm excited.

349
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,370
Get my pen lights out.

350
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,470
Oh my gosh, I haven't heard this song in forever!

351
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,500
Cute!

352
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,980
Cute!

353
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,100
Cute!

354
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,880
Am I gonna get a copyright?

355
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,120
Ha ha ha ha!

356
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,280
Ah!

357
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,600
Cute!

358
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,530
Who's the girl with the sleeves?

359
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,750
Ha ha ha ha!

360
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,130
Oh...

361
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:46,470
Agnes...

362
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,610
Unfortunate name...

363
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,310
Ha ha ha ha!

364
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,000
Actually, Uma娘 are like the perfect...

365
00:22:59,540 --> 00:22:59,860
Idols.

366
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,440
Because like...

367
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,640
It's good to have...

368
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,520
Obviously you need like a stamina, right?

369
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,600
So it's like...

370
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,140
If you are born to run, you have good stamina.

371
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,100
And then you have a good...

372
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,580
The good...

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,580
Like...

374
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,200
You know how...

375
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,780
Like some...

376
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,860
Idols and stuff...

377
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
And singers...

378
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,960
They'll sing while running...

379
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,380
You know?

380
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
To build up that kind of like...

381
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,320
That kind of...

382
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,640
Power...

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Yeah, endurance...

384
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,220
Not quite endurance...

385
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,580
It's like...

386
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,360
Yeah...

387
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
Good physique...

388
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,500
The cardio!

389
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,560
Yeah, cardio...

390
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Mm, mm, mm...

391
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,860
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...

392
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,620
Yeah...

393
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,220
So it's...

394
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,920
You'll find people that will...

395
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,560
Run while singing songs...

396
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,520
I...

397
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:51,940
I...

398
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,040
When I had a treadmill, I could do that...

399
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,460
Ha ha ha!

400
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,540
Breath control!

401
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

402
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,860
The day after watching the race with Taizuna...

403
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,040
And after touching the race...

404
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,920
Happy delivery...

405
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,860
Oh...

406
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,940
Swimming...

407
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Oh...

408
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,980
...

409
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,520
Back to this whole...

410
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,200
Wow, Japan!

411
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,200
Horses!

412
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,820
But Japan.

413
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:22,960
british...

414
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,300
Can such a Alfred Morning?

415
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,320
What the Herrera...

416
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
No!

417
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:28,620
Jump' Hello...

418
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,740
Miriam!

419
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,780
In this, we need to throw it in the very judgy.

420
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,180
I need to get rid of it...

421
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,820
Wow.

422
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,740
Cute!

423
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,540
She speaks so informally, despite her appearance.

424
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,920
I want to pet the kitty.

425
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,160
I want to tell you.

426
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,980
Cat.

427
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,760
Cat.

428
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,380
Oh!

429
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,760
I'm Minto.

430
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,580
I'm a lady.

431
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,620
Though you might not...

432
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,160
You might not...

433
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,040
You might not seeming that way.

434
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,280
But I am.

435
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,380
I'm Minto.

436
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,200
Hello!

437
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,880
I thought you were a horse.

438
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm a little lady.

439
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,400
I...

440
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
I do lady things.

441
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,660
Uh...

442
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,480
Like drink tea.

443
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,540
Minto will always be bro.

444
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,720
Yeah, you can just see me as...

445
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,820
As your homie.

446
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,480
You know?

447
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,680
Drinking tea is lady things?

448
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,760
Hmm...

449
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,140
Yeah.

450
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,660
Reminds me of when I used to race horses.

451
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,580
The horses always won, though.

452
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,420
Hi!

453
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,040
Hi!

454
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,540
Hi!

455
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,540
Hi!

456
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
The twinkle series!

457
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,680
Twinkle series!

458
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,920
You ever think about how these...

459
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Kind of shows are just very like...

460
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,840
Like this is basically...

461
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,160
Like...

462
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,860
If it weren't anime, it would be My Little Pony.

463
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,360
Thank you.

464
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,900
Thank you.

465
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,560
Thank you.

466
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,360
Thank you.

467
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,860
If you're gonna be a horse, the word is mayor.

468
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,820
Or filly if you're cute and funny.

469
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm a...

470
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm a nightmare, then.

471
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,220
Does that mean I'm a lady of the night?

472
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,180
Hmm...

473
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,700
Ja...

474
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,060
My Little Pony is pretty anime, though.

475
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,300
It's like the...

476
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,740
The Friendship is Magic one.

477
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,280
And...

478
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,220
Have you guys ever seen the...

479
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,580
The...

480
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,800
The Japanese voice actresses for that show?

481
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,700
Like...

482
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,820
It's...

483
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,280
Hold on.

484
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,620
Hold on.

485
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,420
The...

486
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,120
It's insane!

487
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,180
Wait, My Little Pony...

488
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,600
It's stacked!

489
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,180
Japanese voice actress...

490
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,060
Japanese cast.

491
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,020
So...

492
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,180
Twilight Sparkle was Sawashiro Miyuki.

493
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,700
Like...

494
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,360
Excuse me!

495
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,620
Applejack was Tokui Sora.

496
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,480
Which is...

497
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Nico Nico Ni.

498
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,940
You know...

499
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,940
You have...

500
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,740
Mimori Suzuko as Pinkie Pie.

501
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,720
The...

502
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,320
It's...

503
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,940
It's completely...

504
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,280
It's...

505
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,040
You have Otani Ikue, who is Apple Bloom.

506
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,320
Like...

507
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,580
And then...

508
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,560
Princess Celestia is voiced by...

509
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Inoue Kikuko, who is...

510
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,340
Who is...

511
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,000
The boss.

512
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,260
But also...

513
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,640
You know...

514
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,080
Incredibly...

515
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,820
Renowned...

516
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,380
Voice actress.

517
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,960
Yeah...

518
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,240
Like...

519
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,000
It's just...

520
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,220
It's completely...

521
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,960
There's no reason that it's...

522
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,180
Such a high tier...

523
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,620
High tier...

524
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,580
List of...

525
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,380
Seiyuu.

526
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,900
It's crazy.

527
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,480
Ugh!

528
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,660
She's my favorite VA.

529
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,100
I met her daughter...

530
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,020
At...

531
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,980
Anime Central.

532
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
She was really sweet.

533
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,640
Okay, back to horse.

534
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,100
But different horse.

535
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,760
Are you eating his fatty tails?

536
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,520
Bachelor...

537
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,280
Trader�antadad.

538
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,460
Trainer Minto.

539
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,940
Seth perspective, can you Entrevassup vibe?

540
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,000
Then...

541
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,100
That こういうふうに ...

542
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,300
Get your total top selfie,

543
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,520
Especially...

544
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:09,660
Oh...

545
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm nervous.

546
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,020
I'm calling the U-Uma Musume.

547
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,920
Okay, trainee U-Uma Musume.

548
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:23,540
If you don't have U-Uma Musume, you can't be able to help the U-Uma Musume.

549
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,040
Okay, career play.

550
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,940
In this gacha, you can meet the U-Uma Musume.

551
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,660
We're gonna go scout some girls, baby!

552
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,340
Oh my god.

553
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,900
Can you reroll in this game, or...

554
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,040
Is it...

555
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,060
Would I have to... If I uninstall and reinstall...

556
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,860
Oh, you can?

557
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,040
It's very easy to.

558
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,140
Oh, it's fast?

559
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,320
Oh, okay.

560
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,480
Alright, here we go.

561
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,800
Permanent.

562
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,020
That's kind of scary, though.

563
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,740
The tutorial scout.

564
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm scary.

565
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,780
I mean, I'm scared.

566
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,200
Okay, here we go.

567
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,380
Perform the tutorial derby scout file.

568
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,680
Okay.

569
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:13,900
Oh, wait.

570
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,700
The scouted U-Uma Musume are fake.

571
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,600
Oh, never mind.

572
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:17,880
Dang it.

573
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,200
Okay.

574
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,520
At least they let you know, right?

575
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,020
Daiwa Scarlet.

576
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,060
She's so pretty.

577
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:36,940
Oh.

578
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,140
Press...

579
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,080
Sakura Vakushin.

580
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,920
Vodka.

581
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,920
Uraraha.

582
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Go on the ship.

583
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,300
Wow, so many people like Vakushin.

584
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,280
Why?

585
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,630
When Mito scouts, girls get cute.

586
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,850
It's cool and cute.

587
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,390
When I do it, it's trespassing.

588
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,570
Noble standards.

589
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,170
She's very silly.

590
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,310
She has speed.

591
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,170
Vakushin.

592
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,330
You must have amazing Uma Musume.

593
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,930
Before we go and start training.

594
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,390
Support card scouting.

595
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:22,750
Okay.

596
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,230
Okay.

597
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,210
Support card.

598
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,210
No kidding.

599
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,690
You get support cards from the support card scout?

600
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:36,750
Whoa.

601
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,690
Vakushin is 99 speed.

602
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,330
One intelligence.

603
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:41,830
I see.

604
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,950
Support card.

605
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,770
I have a question about this game too.

606
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,230
Is it like...

607
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,070
Like...

608
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,750
Is it...

609
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,770
Current with the JP?

610
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,290
Or...

611
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,270
Is it basically starting from...

612
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,470
When it first was released?

613
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,090
So it's...

614
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,170
Two years behind.

615
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,750
It's way behind!

616
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,690
Four years behind!

617
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,010
Starting from scratch!

618
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,570
I want to be surprised then if people who...

619
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,570
Understand how the game works...

620
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,930
Then moves over to the JP.

621
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,750
Might be slightly accelerated.

622
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,010
Four years though!

623
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,730
That's insane!

624
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,010
Man!

625
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,170
1.6 times speed.

626
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,710
So glad Minto is becoming the...

627
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,830
Ultimate Haunt's Trainer!

628
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:48,870
Hehehe.

629
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:49,990
Saa!

630
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,770
Support card gachou!

631
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,610
Hiiitemimashou!

632
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:53,410
Hmm.

633
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,190
Okay.

634
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,590
Ooh, 10s go.

635
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:57,950
Okay.

636
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,520
They're...

637
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,420
They're so...

638
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,840
They're so like...

639
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,610
Just PNGs.

640
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:10,830
What are these?

641
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:14,810
No cap?

642
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,330
Oguri no cap?

643
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,110
Grass wanderer.

644
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,770
She's so cute!

645
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,850
Meiji no be queen!

646
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,310
Oh cute!

647
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,850
Wait...

648
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,790
She's really cute.

649
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,430
Okay.

650
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,370
I'm learning.

651
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,490
I'm seeing new horses.

652
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,810
Um, um, um, um, um.

653
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,580
Ooh!

654
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,640
Human!

655
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,460
Hahaha!

656
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,990
Can we get a kachou?

657
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,490
Yes!

658
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,680
Okay!

659
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,440
My everyday life!

660
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,620
Oh my god.

661
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:58,880
Oh!

662
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,380
Can I...

663
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,240
Can I pat them?

664
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,940
The home screen.

665
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,660
The home screen.

666
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,700
You can't!

667
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,780
Why?

668
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,220
Why?

669
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,140
That's like a big perk!

670
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,420
Of having an anime girl on your screen.

671
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,540
Here.

672
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,960
I'll give you the opportunity.

673
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,780
Here.

674
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:37,640
Since you can't pat those horse girls, special Minto horse girl, you may pat.

675
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,240
You may pat.

676
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,140
You have your fill yet?

677
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:52,880
No?

678
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,390
Career.

679
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,990
I don't have to get a job.

680
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,530
Tap, tap, tap.

681
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,810
Select a scenario.

682
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,130
We're role-playing.

683
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:27,690
Okay.

684
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,690
Ura finale.

685
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,810
Every day is a busy day at Tresen Academy.

686
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,370
Select a career scenario and tackle the problems happening around the school.

687
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,690
Finishing a playthrough will help your trainees grow.

688
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,730
Umamushimai.

689
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,610
Who should we choose?

690
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,130
So it doesn't count, I guess?

691
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,790
Take on the Twinkle series and make dreams come true!

692
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,190
I'm going to hug her and spin her in a circle and then see how far I can toss her.

693
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,310
I would like to see you try.

694
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,710
I don't think you can...

695
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,370
I don't think you can throw ghosts.

696
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,630
No choices.

697
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,090
Start your favorite Umamushimai's career.

698
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,030
Each Umamushimai is unique.

699
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,410
They have different attributes, skills, and aptitudes.

700
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,190
You can train them as many times as you like.

701
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,630
So how about you start by selecting the one you're most interested in?

702
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,370
Oh.

703
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,750
You are most...

704
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,790
You are most interested in Daiwa Scarlet.

705
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,590
Okay.

706
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,310
Understood.

707
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,270
Three goddesses statue.

708
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,550
I do not know what you did.

709
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,510
I do not know what you .

710
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,790
In fact, Daiwa Scarlet is Agnes... How do you say her name?

711
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:10,250
Ta... Ta... Ta... Ta... Ta... Ta Chiyon's daughter...

712
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,110
Dasuka dai suki...

713
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,880
Ta... Ta-Tah-Tachiyon!

714
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,720
Oh, thank you.

715
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,460
The second one is Takya.

716
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:31,720
Oh my god...

717
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,880
Horse gods... goddesses...

718
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,620
As a tradition, the students of Tore-sen-Gakuen are in front of this女神像.

719
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
How are Uma Musume born?

720
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,930
I would like to know the birds in the neys.

721
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,670
Explain to me like I'm 12 years old.

722
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,910
It's a mystery.

723
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,530
Cuz there's no...

724
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,020
Uma...

725
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,120
Daenshi?

726
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,020
What would you even call them?

727
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,640
Haunts eggs.

728
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,450
They have human dads.

729
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,050
You wish.

730
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,980
They do!

731
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,680
No, you guys are pulling my leg.

732
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,880
You watch the anime.

733
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,180
It was a long time ago, okay?

734
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,820
It was when it first came out.

735
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,650
Hmm...

736
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,050
Hmm...

737
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,090
Hmm...

738
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,850
Hmm...

739
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,210
A veteran Uma娘.

740
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,010
She just retires?

741
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,570
Sparks of Inspiration.

742
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,110
She just can pass on Sparks of Inspiration.

743
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,750
If you choose to be a female, she doesn't have a woman.

744
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,890
Please be careful.

745
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,230
Maiano Top Gun's dad is a pilot.

746
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,810
They don't let horses fly planes.

747
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,830
Sad.

748
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,510
Oh.

749
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:39,910
Goodbye.

750
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,550
What was her name again?

751
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,570
Well, to the glue farm.

752
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,630
A second one?

753
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,970
Sacrifice.

754
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,990
Vodka!

755
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,270
Oh, auto-select.

756
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,970
Include guests?

757
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,370
Vodka!

758
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,550
Vodka!

759
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,550
Vodka!

760
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:11,950
Vodka!

761
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,050
Vodka!

762
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,010
Vodka!

763
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,290
Vodka!

764
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:43,670
After your training with the legacies of veteran runners, sparks of inspiration can raise attributes and aptitudes at the start of a career, as well as during it through inspiration events.

765
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,750
It's a family tree.

766
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,890
Little did you know you'll actually be playing eugenics like on those games Batara likes.

767
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,130
What is Batara playing?

768
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,150
I don't know what Batara likes.

769
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,790
That's what we're calling it.

770
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,800
I see it.

771
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,910
As many times.

772
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,400
Support cards, okay?

773
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,820
Super horse method!

774
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,020
Which is your Oshi?

775
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,420
I haven't chosen one yet.

776
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,860
I don't know them well enough yet.

777
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,920
It might not happen today, but we'll see.

778
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,140
Like I said, it might be love at first sight.

779
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,440
We'll see.

780
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,140
You can't choose a support card depicting the same Uma Musume that you selected to train.

781
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,660
Okay, okay, okay.

782
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,520
Ooh, these are so cute!

783
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,740
Let's choose support cards to boost your career.

784
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,240
Let's choose support cards...

785
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,000
You'll receive support...

786
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,080
Oh, sorry guys.

787
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,180
I'm so...

788
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,760
I'm so sleepy today.

789
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,400
I'm still so jet-lagged.

790
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,060
It's really bad.

791
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,180
Um...

792
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,220
Career events corresponding to the cards are more likely to occur.

793
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,200
Please note that you cannot select the character you're training.

794
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,400
Yeah.

795
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,920
That makes sense.

796
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,360
Support cards each have a type.

797
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,060
Support cards have types.

798
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,000
Preferred training.

799
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,460
The effects gained when training together vary from card to card.

800
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,000
So speed, stamina, power, and guts.

801
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:02,980
Guts.

802
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,360
They give you side stories, stats, and skills.

803
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,120
Still jet-hagged?

804
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,320
Yeah, just a little bit.

805
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,660
I mean, it's better.

806
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,840
But, you know.

807
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,480
Neptune!

808
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,340
Welcome to Mamusha, thank you!

809
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,320
Friendship training.

810
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,860
If you raise the friendship gauge of support cards during a career, then friendship training will occur.

811
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,360
Oh, I'll try to stop yawning.

812
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,320
Oh, okay.

813
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,660
So our legacy...

814
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,080
Gold ship has two children.

815
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,080
And so does Vodka.

816
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,460
Vodka is one of the children of Gold ship.

817
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,620
TP.

818
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,470
This... is Tristan Academy.

819
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,970
Here, promising young umamusume gathered to train as racers.

820
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,970
Their hearts filled with dreams of glory found in the Twinkle series.

821
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:12,590
Together with their schoolmates, they spend their days training both body and mind.

822
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,710
Yet, not all are content with the current state of the Academy.

823
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,750
Oh my gosh.

824
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:22,810
Uh...

825
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,810
We're gonna have an uprising?

826
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,170
Tiki!

827
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,130
I'm not gonna do it!

828
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,630
Um...

829
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,170
What's up as you thought this guy who is?

830
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:37,830
T...

831
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:37,970
Tazuna.

832
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,310
Tazuna!

833
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,170
I'm the patron tutor in my mind.

834
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,570
And this is the second one.

835
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:51,730
We are not able to achieve this situation.

836
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,030
We are not able to achieve this situation.

837
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,030
Who's being squandered?

838
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,990
I like the different camera angles.

839
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,750
It's so dynamic.

840
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,750
I'm going to launch the new race.

841
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:07,610
No.

842
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:07,690
Ooh!

843
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:08,430
Eh?

844
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,470
Sh...

845
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,110
...sh...

846
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,350
...sh...

847
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,190
...shin race...

848
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,970
...desuka?

849
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,110
KOTI!

850
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,710
...mina ga kokoro zas...

851
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,050
...Dwinklou series!

852
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,030
...sono sakini!

853
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:23,330
Ooooooh!

854
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,430
...subete no kyori...

855
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,350
...subete no korsoo o yoishita...

856
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,410
...alata na dai rase o koro na ta!

857
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,270
The mocap and story is pretty great too.

858
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,070
Yeah!

859
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,710
The mocap is so good in this game.

860
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,410
Oh, the 3D in general...

861
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,470
...everything looks so nice.

862
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,430
...sono namo...

863
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,730
...oh?

864
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:50,810
Oh, oh!

865
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,530
That's what they were talking about before!

866
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,430
...RF...

867
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,330
...final...

868
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,370
...isogashiku naruzo!

869
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,650
Uma Musume Racing...

870
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,050
...you are a...

871
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:06,790
...racing...

872
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,390
...sassoku...

873
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,570
...kono dai niusu o tsutaeru...

874
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,870
...kisha kai-ken no junbi da!

875
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,650
...association?

876
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,210
Hmm...

877
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,930
...a press meeting...

878
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,750
...iji-chou...

879
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,630
...thehehe...

880
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,690
...she's so moved...

881
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,090
...souji shimashita...

882
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:30,770
...te hai shimasu!

883
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,260
And thus...

884
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,980
...begins the story of a new racing event...

885
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,900
...the URA Finale...

886
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,400
...created to help all Uma Musume shine...

887
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,880
...this race...

888
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,900
...shall be the stage upon which you and your trainee's story unfolds!

889
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,920
...shinsetsu...

890
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,260
...URA Finals!

891
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,330
...waah...

892
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:03,570
...countless Uma Musume have come to the Three Goddesses statue...

893
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,030
...to carry on the dreams of legends past...

894
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,230
...or to entrust their own to those yet to come...

895
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,070
...today those legacies spark inspiration...

896
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,630
...and yet another new runner!

897
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,430
...uh...

898
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,630
...woah...

899
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:17,770
...woah...

900
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,050
...woah...

901
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:19,630
...woah...

902
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,720
...I-I'm inspired...!

903
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,720
...I'm inspired...!

904
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,100
...I'm inspired!

905
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,230
...

906
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,070
...their legacies live on the speed 1.5!

907
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,330
7.5...

908
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,290
...power 10...

909
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:44,870
...guTS!

910
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,070
5...

911
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:47,130
...wit 5...

912
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,150
...oh my god, she's smart!

913
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,570
She's DART!

914
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,030
Sprint...

915
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,490
Long aptitude!

916
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,690
Oh, okay.

917
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,250
Two turns.

918
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,170
Today I start training with Daiwa Scarlet in earnest.

919
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,230
Our journey to make her the number one umamusume begins here!

920
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:19,630
Hmph.

921
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:19,870
Dart.

922
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,610
Okay.

923
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,490
So we have two turns.

924
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:32,710
Okay.

925
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,250
Oh, and then we can choose what we want to try.

926
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,250
There's no chance of failure.

927
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:41,350
Oh.

928
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,850
I'm just kidding, we're doing speed.

929
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,290
Energy went down by 15.

930
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,050
Sippy!

931
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:53,730
Thank you!

932
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,430
Tutorial is short, the actual game is about 70 turns!

933
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,130
The tutorial holds your hand for way too long.

934
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,370
Ah, I don't mind that so much though, actually.

935
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,390
Though I am someone...

936
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,790
Who has to kind of like get into it to learn, you know?

937
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,570
There's an arcade version of Ace Combat 1 called Air Combat!

938
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,850
Wait, I know Air Combat!

939
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,090
I've heard of it!

940
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:34,150
Available now on modern consoles, so grab it if you can.

941
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:34,950
Thank you, Nan!

942
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,970
Thank you, Nan!

943
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,070
I will.

944
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,170
The tutorial gives a really good grasp of what to expect.

945
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,850
I've always been kind of in...

946
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,090
Like I said, I would see the...

947
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,990
The interface of umamusume and...

948
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:54,290
I would feel so intimidated, so...

949
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,710
One day as I'm rounding a corner...

950
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:05,450
Oh,

951
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,590
wait, it's not fully voiced.

952
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,410
Sorry, but I made a promise, so I'll be...

953
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,150
A promise?

954
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,730
What are we, nosy?

955
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,690
Why are we so nosy?

956
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,030
Yes!

957
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,970
I completely forgot, I promised to race with my friends, so...

958
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:22,890
I'm rushing over there now.

959
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,230
I... I'm even getting vaccinated on what?

960
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:28,830
Shoei?

961
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,130
What?

962
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,050
What?

963
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,630
How to speak?

964
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,210
You'd better hurry, then.

965
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,430
Arigatou gozaimasu!

966
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,730
And, um, thanks, and I'm sorry for crashing into you.

967
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:40,270
Bye!

968
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,310
Oh, she's zooming.

969
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,370
Special weak runs off in a...

970
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,610
Again in a panic, however.

971
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,190
Huh?

972
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,100
Eureka!

973
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,780
I got an idea that could be useful for Daiwa Scarlet's training.

974
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,180
Running in the halls.

975
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,340
This contributed to Daiwa Scarlet's growth.

976
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,340
Ah, yeah, we got more guts.

977
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,100
Because we took them...

978
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,040
After...

979
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,720
Special weak had the accident, and her guts spilled everywhere.

980
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,620
And so we took hers, and then we got 15 more.

981
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,700
Uh, looks like you had a conversation with one of the support-umamusumae.

982
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,940
Ganbatte kudasai!

983
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,060
Rest in peace, special weak.

984
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,900
Every single encounter is a precious experience.

985
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,080
Be sure to make use of them while training.

986
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,660
Incidentally, the academy is a big place, so you also have a chance of meeting individuals who weren't included in your support card deck.

987
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,620
Next time...

988
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,940
Watching from work tonight!

989
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,500
Good luck with work!

990
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,020
I'm already yawning.

991
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,600
Oh gosh.

992
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,060
Can I get an energy beam?

993
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,320
Also, hydration check.

994
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,320
I drink.

995
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,700
Energy...

996
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,340
I also need energy beam.

997
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,480
Now I'll explain about energy!

998
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:10,940
Oh!

999
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,440
We need the energy!

1000
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,720
Training...

1001
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,540
Take note of the failure rate.

1002
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,780
No way we're gonna fail 20%.

1003
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,340
The lower your training's energy, the higher the failure rate.

1004
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:23,980
Okay, okay.

1005
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,240
I've played something like that, like this before.

1006
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,620
I can't remember what it was.

1007
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,820
Where it's similar, where like the lower your energy, the higher the failure rate.

1008
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,560
Hmm, I can't remember.

1009
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,640
I have failed 1%?!

1010
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,660
Failing a training can lead to drops and attributes and mood, so be careful!

1011
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,780
Can we go back?

1012
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,240
This is low energy?!

1013
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,860
Monster Rancher...

1014
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,820
No...

1015
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,080
Wasn't Shiny Mash...

1016
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,360
I can't remember...

1017
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,120
It was something like...

1018
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,400
I feel like I was...

1019
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,080
Pretty into it, so...

1020
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,080
It's mid energy...

1021
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,060
Yeah, okay...

1022
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,100
Okay...

1023
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:14,360
Trainer...

1024
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,480
Did you get some relaxation time in on your break?

1025
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,080
I'm completely refreshed, obviously.

1026
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,740
Every model student knows how to switch gears between work and play.

1027
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,360
Just wait till you see how well I trained today!

1028
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,320
Brroop!

1029
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,570
Castle Crashers is re-releasing a character...

1030
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,260
Creation DLC on August 6th.

1031
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,680
Could open the door for you and your friends to be in the game.

1032
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,340
Wow...

1033
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,300
That'd be cool!

1034
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:46,850
Hit with the energy beam...

1035
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,280
We're finally ready to give racing a try!

1036
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,180
Umu!

1037
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,720
Before participating in a race, always be sure to check your skills!

1038
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,880
Is this...

1039
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,640
Are the skills in this game passive, or is it like...

1040
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,000
When you are...

1041
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,900
Playing, you activate it yourself.

1042
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,160
They're passive...

1043
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,000
All passive!

1044
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,300
Oh!

1045
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,480
I don't have to do anything?

1046
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,860
I can just watch!

1047
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,560
Nice!

1048
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,960
Skill points!

1049
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,460
Skill points can be acquired at various times during your career playthrough.

1050
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:30,890
Okay...

1051
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,910
Click on the skill set.

1052
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,690
Select the skill set.

1053
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:35,910
Select the skill set.

1054
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,950
Select the skill set.

1055
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:39,810
You should select the skill set.

1056
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,370
Say I decrease fatigue mid race?

1057
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:43,350
Oh!

1058
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:43,970
What?

1059
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:46,570
Skill.

1060
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,130
Skill is a big factor.

1061
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:48,770
Skill set.

1062
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,110
Skill from using the turn Celta.

1063
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:52,630
Don't you carry.

1064
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,870
So, let's try to practice them.

1065
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,450
Oh, okay.

1066
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,790
The music is so good.

1067
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,250
Ah, but I'm such a hoarder!

1068
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:13,950
I'm such a hoarder for points!

1069
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,310
I'm like, what if I need it later?

1070
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,110
They literally called me out.

1071
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,350
You should select skills that best match your trainees' abilities.

1072
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,430
And the races she plans to run in.

1073
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:31,710
Okay.

1074
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,910
Time to race!

1075
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:39,890
Okay.

1076
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,490
Kyoto Turf, 2000 meter.

1077
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,310
Let's go.

1078
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,330
Race!

1079
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,930
It's time for Daiwa Scarlett's debut race!

1080
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:00,590
Alas, I'm going to enter the Twinkle Series.

1081
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,550
Let's go, my legs are itching to run!

1082
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,470
Yo, go get that number one spot, ya hear?

1083
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,830
You don't need to remind me.

1084
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,750
I'll have the most spectacular debut there ever was.

1085
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,830
Everyone will wish they could copy me.

1086
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:30,430
Let's go, my legs are like, I'll be happy.

1087
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:32,850
Yikes.

1088
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,230
Little Fanta.

1089
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,990
Oh, ok, nice.

1090
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:41,910
Ah, thank you, nice.

1091
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,360
Oh, yikes.

1092
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,440
Ok, we're fine.

1093
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,720
We'll make it.

1094
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,040
First, let me explain to the point of view.

1095
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:05,240
The point of view is 20, 0, 0, 3, and 0.

1096
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,440
I will show a high score on the right side of the right side of the right side of the right side.

1097
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,060
We win.

1098
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,460
Number one fave.

1099
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,020
That's us, that's us.

1100
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:40,700
The mood,

1101
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:43,870
too.

1102
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:46,930
The mood, too.

1103
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,310
Oh, oops, sorry.

1104
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,070
I double-click.

1105
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:51,810
My bad.

1106
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:54,430
Okay.

1107
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,090
Let's go.

1108
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,970
Okay, so if they do, like, the last spurt at the end, or...

1109
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:10,010
They keep a steady pace, or if they go fast at front, or...

1110
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,110
What does late mean, though?

1111
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,830
Maybe there's later, not at the end?

1112
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,330
I guess?

1113
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,990
All right, let's go!

1114
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:24,250
Oh!

1115
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:25,910
Guts.

1116
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,710
That's when you make a break for it.

1117
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,090
Push after the second half.

1118
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:31,590
Okay, okay.

1119
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,090
Apple cider.

1120
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:34,730
Mmm.

1121
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,230
I've never heard of a single one of these girls before.

1122
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:45,210
They all look like NPCs.

1123
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,970
This girl is the same girl, just recolored.

1124
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,490
They look like NPCs, and Daiwa looks like the...

1125
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,290
The main character, you know?

1126
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,090
Like...

1127
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:01,210
When you...

1128
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,450
Have all the other girls in the class.

1129
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:04,650
Like with...

1130
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:06,090
Look boring in the anime.

1131
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,190
NPC recolored.

1132
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,390
Okay.

1133
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,810
I love Umamusume.

1134
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,900
We're gonna sweep these girls.

1135
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,680
Hi!

1136
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,860
Cute trumpet rhythm!

1137
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,820
Yummy apple cider.

1138
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,240
Oh my god!

1139
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,000
She's so overdressed.

1140
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,960
Oh my god.

1141
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,060
There he is!

1142
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:46,840
Wow!

1143
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,080
She's good.

1144
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,640
She's cool.

1145
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,800
Oh, I'm just kidding.

1146
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,820
Good thing I'm not doing the announcement.

1147
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,720
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow, that one!

1148
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,140
Wow,

1149
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,360
wow, wow, wow, wait!

1150
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,800
Number 8.

1151
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,960
Number 4.

1152
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,420
Yeah, okay.

1153
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,860
Oh gosh, they're all catching up.

1154
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,600
They look... their faces, they look so desperate.

1155
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,740
Ha ha ha...

1156
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,600
Her preferred position is first.

1157
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,020
Ha ha ha ha...

1158
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:08,440
Ha ha ha...

1159
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,540
The Harry's echo?

1160
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,760
What are these um-amusume going to do?!

1161
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,160
Apple Cider!

1162
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:29,320
Daiwa?

1163
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,500
Duh.

1164
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,940
The secret!

1165
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,760
The secret skill!

1166
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,280
Look at that fan service.

1167
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:01,640
First!

1168
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,120
Nice.

1169
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,100
Congratulations on the win.

1170
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:10,340
Consider this the first page of the legend they'll write together.

1171
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,630
I praised her well.

1172
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,160
The jiggle physics are incredible.

1173
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,680
After the debut.

1174
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,360
Great work out there.

1175
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,240
This is hardly enough to satisfy me.

1176
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,860
I need more if I'm going to become number one.

1177
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,440
Ah, greedy girl.

1178
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,000
We'll get you number one.

1179
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,000
Well, maybe not you.

1180
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,020
I don't know.

1181
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:05,540
You're fine.

1182
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,160
You're cute.

1183
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,380
Not my favorite.

1184
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,560
You've reached your goal.

1185
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,560
Well done.

1186
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,140
Bravo!

1187
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,340
This doesn't make any sense.

1188
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,080
The flatter horses should be faster.

1189
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,840
Less weight and wind resistance.

1190
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,600
Well, I...

1191
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,500
I...

1192
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,100
I...

1193
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,580
I don't think that...

1194
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,280
I...

1195
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:32,720
I think...

1196
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,620
Wind resistance?

1197
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:34,720
No!

1198
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,180
Wouldn't it be...

1199
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,400
More difficult...

1200
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,420
If it's...

1201
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,360
Just going against like a flat board?

1202
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,660
Right?

1203
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,210
Less weight.

1204
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,550
It's...

1205
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,170
Not...

1206
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:00,690
It's...

1207
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,470
Mus...

1208
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:02,630
Not the boob.

1209
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:04,750
The leg or muscle.

1210
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,230
Yeah.

1211
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,810
But...

1212
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:12,770
Hmm...

1213
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,910
Um...

1214
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:15,890
Don't worry about it.

1215
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:22,010
Hitting Mike Tyson's ass!

1216
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,190
You...

1217
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:24,710
You...

1218
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:25,110
You stream?

1219
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,670
He does it all!

1220
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:46,470
He streams!

1221
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,660
Oh my god!

1222
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,440
Thank you guys for the gift of...

1223
01:05:59,440 --> 01:05:59,920
Thank you!

1224
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,260
Thank you!

1225
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,120
My Kami Yoshi has made a ghost and a horse!

1226
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,060
Thank you!

1227
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,180
Thanks for the...

1228
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:11,700
For the...

1229
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,720
For the redirect!

1230
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,480
Thank you!

1231
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:23,510
The goals that you are after will differ depending on the umu musume.

1232
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:27,750
Please help your trainees reach their goals during their careers!

1233
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,990
Of course!

1234
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:30,770
It's hard to do!

1235
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:31,670
It's hard to do!

1236
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:35,030
If you have any skill points left, please be careful of your use.

1237
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,270
Please be careful of your use.

1238
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:38,190
Please be careful of your use.

1239
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:38,610
The training is done!

1240
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,050
My real Oshi...

1241
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:46,270
We'll don't know him any time!

1242
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,070
I'm glad you could find your number one!

1243
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,250
Ha ha ha ha!

1244
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:53,870
Ha ha ha ha!

1245
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:56,990
Damn!

1246
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,830
Just don't forget about me though!

1247
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,240
Career is usually three years long!

1248
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:04,740
Damn!

1249
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,840
Treasure the time you spend together with your trainees!

1250
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:12,700
Wait!

1251
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,720
What about my skill points?

1252
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,060
Oh!

1253
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,500
She literally just said, Don't forget to use your skill points!

1254
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,260
And then they...

1255
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,780
They make me abandon it!

1256
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,840
Go ahead!

1257
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:38,800
Whoa.

1258
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,540
Ha ha ha ha

1259
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,140
ha!

1260
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,380
Ah...

1261
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:56,980
Ah...

1262
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,230
What?

1263
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,490
What do you say?

1264
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,430
Ah...

1265
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,900
Ah...

1266
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,300
What do you say?

1267
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:11,880
Anyway...

1268
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,100
Bye!

1269
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,420
Yappa yappa horse.

1270
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,620
Yappa yappa mechanics.

1271
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,100
Click the eye button.

1272
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,160
Oh, okay, nice.

1273
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,060
If I'm washed.

1274
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,980
Where's the eye button?

1275
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,310
I'm in the...

1276
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:52,870
Yes.

1277
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:09,630
Ah...

1278
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:18,010
I just got here.

1279
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,410
Why is she named F rank?

1280
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,210
Hand holding?

1281
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:26,790
Is that allowed with the horse?

1282
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:28,410
Intro!

1283
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:28,510
Oh!

1284
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,220
Psygames.

1285
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,460
I was big Psygames because of Preakune.

1286
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:17,000
Wah-wah-woo!

1287
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,520
With the gold ship.

1288
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,830
The music in this game is so good though.

1289
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:32,270
Or the series rather...

1290
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:01,950
Oh!

1291
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:13,450
So good!

1292
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,990
Enhance?

1293
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:16,070
Enhance!

1294
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:23,450
Oh, of course you are.

1295
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:36,410
You can manage your veteran umamusume, the racers completed a career playthrough, or you can also strengthen training umamusume in your support card.

1296
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:36,950
Oh, okay.

1297
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:50,790
So I think your trainee umamusume um...support cards will set you up to gain better results.

1298
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:51,190
Yes.

1299
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:55,970
Okay.

1300
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:58,690
Race.

1301
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,330
We're just racing already?

1302
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,110
Okay.

1303
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:06,490
Oh.

1304
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:08,230
Monies.

1305
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,910
You can get monies.

1306
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:14,030
Oh.

1307
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:18,050
Okay.

1308
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:19,110
Dailies.

1309
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:21,810
Oh.

1310
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,490
Monies.

1311
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:26,450
Did you ever play the JP release?

1312
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:26,850
Nope.

1313
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,530
Team Trials.

1314
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:32,530
Are these like...

1315
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,170
Versus other people's horses?

1316
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,470
Oh, El Con no pa esa.

1317
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:43,190
Create your own team and rise to the highest class.

1318
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,310
Form a team of the...

1319
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,750
Yes.

1320
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,110
Okay.

1321
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,510
Raise your high score to get promoted to the next class.

1322
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,310
Bring up to 15 umamusume to compete in five different races.

1323
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,290
Okay.

1324
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:56,730
Interesting.

1325
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:00,090
Okay.

1326
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,570
Okay.

1327
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,610
I think I get it.

1328
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,710
Gosh, she's really cute.

1329
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,430
She kind of looks like a...

1330
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,490
A squirrel though.

1331
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:17,270
Is it so cute?

1332
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,350
That's really...

1333
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,750
I'm not a squirrel.

1334
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,970
Nesha no flower.

1335
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,130
She's the smallest horse.

1336
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,030
How is she B?

1337
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,370
I only have one.

1338
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,950
I have one veteran, Uma Musume.

1339
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,870
She's very fast.

1340
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,910
I'm not that small!

1341
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,110
I don't understand why everybody thinks I'm so small.

1342
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:02,110
I see people who are like, oh my gosh...

1343
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:04,510
Finally...

1344
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,990
Minto is taller than the said VTuber.

1345
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:12,150
I'm... I am 149cm!

1346
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,550
There are many VTuber that are way smaller than me!

1347
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,260
There are many who are much smaller than me!

1348
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:39,030
You're smaller than JPEG dogs over at Pozo.

1349
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:44,630
I have a more highly skilled veteran, Uma Musume.

1350
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:45,390
Rise with Team Rite.

1351
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,170
Aki.

1352
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,570
I have one girl.

1353
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,730
Daiwa Scarlet.

1354
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:52,850
Go!

1355
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:55,230
Pace A!

1356
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:56,130
Go!

1357
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:57,930
Confirmed.

1358
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:58,630
That's all I got.

1359
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:02,170
Oh, yeah.

1360
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,430
We're getting some carrots.

1361
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,430
I wanna eat carrots.

1362
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,930
Is Urara so small too?

1363
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,330
How tall is she?

1364
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:19,350
I'm not as small uses a step ladder to sign...

1365
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:21,510
First of all, it was an actual ladder.

1366
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:25,470
Because where I signed the wall was very high up.

1367
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:26,990
It was close to the ceiling!

1368
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,110
She's 140, see?

1369
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:31,770
She's smaller than me.

1370
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,420
I'm not that small!

1371
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:44,540
Cool!

1372
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,240
There are plans to hold many more races from here on.

1373
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,880
So be sure to participate as much as you can.

1374
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,080
Hi, Amito.

1375
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:04,640
Hello!

1376
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,280
GM stands for Cutie Meters.

1377
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,100
Oh, so I'm not that cute.

1378
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,560
If some girls are like...

1379
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,540
150, 160 cute, I'm only...

1380
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:19,940
149 cute.

1381
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,800
So you're saying I'm not so cute, huh?

1382
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,600
That's fine, because I'm spooky.

1383
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:31,670
She got you there.

1384
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:38,730
I'm spooky.

1385
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:41,430
I'm a ghost.

1386
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,790
I'm a ghost.

1387
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,930
It works like golf.

1388
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:47,950
The lower the better.

1389
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:51,530
Everybody knows big number is better.

1390
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:52,870
Doesn't matter.

1391
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,450
What sport.

1392
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:01,030
Sure remember that career playthroughs and racing are integral to making your trainees stronger.

1393
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,990
Okay.

1394
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:04,550
No.

1395
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:14,800
Oh.

1396
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,440
New support card.

1397
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,060
I love her.

1398
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,460
She's so cute.

1399
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:29,920
I remember when she first came- when it was first announced...

1400
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,640
And I was like...

1401
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,940
Oh my gosh, she looks like...

1402
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,100
Designed by MikaPikazoo, right?

1403
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,260
I got some carrots.

1404
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,840
More carrots.

1405
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,620
Can you just say horse game stood for Minto?

1406
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:49,920
Thank you.

1407
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,840
149cm of pure freakiness.

1408
01:17:58,850 --> 01:17:59,730
Alright.

1409
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:01,830
Do we gotcha?

1410
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,850
I have the Emmy.

1411
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:10,310
24 karat gold labubu.

1412
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,210
Gotcha time!

1413
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,510
No, not the brain rot.

1414
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:26,550
Sorry.

1415
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:33,370
Thank you!

1416
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:36,830
What is that?

1417
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,950
Ice cube?

1418
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,630
Sugar cube?

1419
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,190
Do you get sugar cubes in this game?

1420
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,490
Thank you, thank you.

1421
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,990
Two...

1422
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,890
Two...

1423
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,610
Don't worry, height won't affect your Uma娘's speed or racing ability.

1424
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,350
You're still short though.

1425
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:56,110
Step to level your support cards.

1426
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:56,610
I see.

1427
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:58,410
So we got episode one!

1428
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,550
Oh, scout...

1429
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:01,430
Or be scouted.

1430
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:03,570
I don't want to...

1431
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:03,690
I don't want to...

1432
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,250
Oh, I thought that's it.

1433
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,270
I don't want to lose you.

1434
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:06,850
I was gonna say...

1435
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:10,310
Vaccine!

1436
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:12,910
Oh wow, we got a lot...

1437
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,750
Oh wait, so this is the different people.

1438
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:15,870
Okay, I see, I see.

1439
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:19,430
I see.

1440
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,230
To scout?

1441
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:24,610
Let's grab our things first.

1442
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:25,850
Holy moly!

1443
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:32,090
It's...

1444
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,500
carrot jelly!

1445
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:41,170
Whoa!

1446
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:43,190
Whoa!

1447
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,820
SSR guaranteed!

1448
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:05,750
What is this?

1449
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:08,210
Is this like a...

1450
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:15,830
Daily thing that you do when you collect the stuff?

1451
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,990
Daily missions.

1452
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:28,130
And that's why I want to make a challenge for the future, as I am, and as a trainer.

1453
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:33,350
So, let's win a mission!

1454
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:41,170
I don't feel like I'm gonna have to, like, re-roll in that...

1455
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,590
I, like, have to restart the game or whatever.

1456
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,590
Because they gave us so many!

1457
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:49,970
Well, I guess we'll see how many carrots are for a 10-pole.

1458
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,150
Now!

1459
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,370
We'll see!

1460
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:56,030
We'll see!

1461
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:56,630
We'll see!

1462
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,970
We'll see!

1463
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,210
Re-rolling is super quick, at least.

1464
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:03,690
Oh, yeah?

1465
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:04,810
Okay.

1466
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,910
1,500 for 10.

1467
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:10,890
Oh, that's...

1468
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,410
I feel like that's pretty standard, no?

1469
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:14,030
Like...

1470
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,030
Well, no, maybe it's, like, usually...

1471
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:17,030
1,200.

1472
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:17,970
I guess it depends.

1473
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:19,650
Uh-uh.

1474
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:21,650
Okay, okay.

1475
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:26,570
People usually re-roll the SSR Guaranteed Support card till they get a meta one.

1476
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:33,710
Ahhhh...

1477
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:34,020
But...

1478
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:38,390
I am a firm waifu over meta believer.

1479
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,930
So, if I like the character...

1480
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,550
If I think they're cute, then...

1481
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,550
Hmm...

1482
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:48,030
Hmm...

1483
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:48,410
Hmm...

1484
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:48,590
That's nice.

1485
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,410
Thank you so much.

1486
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:50,690
Hmm...

1487
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:51,290
Mm-mm...

1488
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,750
I've also prepared...

1489
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,840
Hmm...

1490
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,280
Thousand percent correct...

1491
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,460
It's really bad!

1492
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:19,660
It's really bad!

1493
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,460
Ah, this makes me really want to eat carrots.

1494
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:27,800
A try!

1495
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:34,000
Wait, you can see girls on the... Oh, look, they're all around!

1496
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,120
What's this?

1497
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:42,040
Ah, request a song.

1498
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:47,150
Make a debut.

1499
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:50,950
Where can I go?

1500
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:55,110
Amazing!

1501
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,100
Oh, was this also a mission?

1502
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,240
Oh, nice.

1503
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,680
Let's get my money.

1504
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:11,360
Alright.

1505
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,260
Shall we gacha?

1506
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,780
Shall we gacha?

1507
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,040
What?

1508
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:20,060
This is the guest guaranteed one, yeah?

1509
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,580
I guess I should do this one first, huh?

1510
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,600
Oh, wait.

1511
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,020
Oh!

1512
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,840
Wait, which is the one that...

1513
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,480
Oh, here, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1514
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,580
This is the one with the...

1515
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,180
Actually, or should we...

1516
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,280
Two!

1517
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's pretty pointless since they dump so much on you to get stars.

1518
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,460
So there's little in the game at this point.

1519
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,960
You get enough carrots just by playing normally that you don't need to worry about getting what you want.

1520
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,280
Hmm.

1521
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,580
This is the one where you'd reroll.

1522
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1523
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,960
Should we save it for last?

1524
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:01,740
Or should we...

1525
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:05,920
There's also the support cards.

1526
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:14,720
Oh, they do the thing where it's like the separate free jammies versus the paid jammies.

1527
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,400
I see, I see.

1528
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,380
I see, I see.

1529
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,820
Oh, yeah, I can't do this one because it's paid only.

1530
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,400
Mejiro.

1531
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:32,920
Look at her though.

1532
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:33,780
She's so pretty.

1533
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,690
Oh, goody, no cap.

1534
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:41,510
Okay.

1535
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:42,930
Well, that one's also paid.

1536
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:49,250
So I would only be able to do this one or this one.

1537
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,730
I see, I see.

1538
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:52,530
Okay.

1539
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:53,670
Okay.

1540
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:59,110
Here we go.

1541
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:02,750
Okay.

1542
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:04,250
I'm scared.

1543
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,310
There's a selector ticket you can use as well.

1544
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:10,970
As an earnable...

1545
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,090
Or an earnable guaranteed ticket.

1546
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:13,810
Hmm.

1547
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:21,070
Three.

1548
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:22,210
Two.

1549
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:23,330
One.

1550
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:25,390
I don't know who I want.

1551
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,950
Wait, is there like a...

1552
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:27,570
Wait, details.

1553
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:28,190
Oh, no.

1554
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:28,790
No.

1555
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,910
Feature cards?

1556
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:30,870
Oh, here we go, here we go.

1557
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:32,570
I want to see who we can get.

1558
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:33,850
Okay.

1559
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:36,770
I would be okay with Teo or Gold Ship.

1560
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:39,110
El Condor Paso.

1561
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,710
Tamamo is really cute.

1562
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,160
Oh.

1563
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,260
Nishino.

1564
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,680
These are support abilities...

1565
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:55,880
Wait.

1566
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:56,520
Huh?

1567
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,120
Are these not the cards you can get in here?

1568
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,060
Oh, wait.

1569
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:02,440
You're right.

1570
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,420
These are support cards.

1571
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,220
Wait.

1572
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,640
How do I know it's in here?

1573
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:06,880
Wait.

1574
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,020
Are these all support cards?

1575
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:09,220
Sorry.

1576
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:09,660
I'm so...

1577
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:10,080
Oh, sorry.

1578
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,080
I guess...

1579
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,040
Oh.

1580
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,900
So then...

1581
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,930
Ah, I see.

1582
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:31,950
Oh, but...

1583
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:32,950
It says the trainees.

1584
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,770
Ah.

1585
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:35,070
I see.

1586
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:35,510
I see.

1587
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:36,530
Oh.

1588
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:36,850
Eh.

1589
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,250
Ah.

1590
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:37,750
Eh.

1591
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:39,710
I wanna...

1592
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:39,910
Eh.

1593
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:40,430
Ah.

1594
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,830
Eh.

1595
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:45,110
What do I see?

1596
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,890
I don't wanna...

1597
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:46,830
I wanna see everybody.

1598
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:48,770
Oh, wait.

1599
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:49,630
This is just the spotlight.

1600
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:51,110
Okay.

1601
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,390
Okay.

1602
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:52,530
She's the spotlight card.

1603
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:56,870
She's the only featured one.

1604
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:57,970
Oh, I see.

1605
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:00,650
Interesting.

1606
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,370
Okay.

1607
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:02,850
I'm still...

1608
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,010
I'm figuring it out, guys.

1609
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,130
I'm figuring it.

1610
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,050
I'm figuring it out.

1611
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:08,810
Okay.

1612
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,630
So these ones are all...

1613
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:13,310
Twin Turbo support cards.

1614
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:14,890
Or rather, that's a spotlight.

1615
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:16,310
Okay.

1616
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:16,610
Okay.

1617
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:16,890
Okay.

1618
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,870
No standard generic banner.

1619
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:20,690
Really?

1620
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:22,890
Oh.

1621
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,030
Oh, yeah.

1622
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:25,350
Okay.

1623
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,570
Let's go for the...

1624
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:28,450
The card then.

1625
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:30,270
Okay.

1626
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:31,690
It won't be a horse.

1627
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,350
It'll just be a support card.

1628
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:35,630
So I guess...

1629
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,230
I don't even know.

1630
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:39,070
Well, I guess meta doesn't...

1631
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:39,970
Unless I...

1632
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,510
Unless I know the meta.

1633
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,190
It doesn't matter what I get.

1634
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:44,090
I feel.

1635
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:47,190
Because it's just a support card.

1636
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:48,970
No haunts.

1637
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:50,950
Here we go.

1638
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,670
Fine motion.

1639
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:04,670
Oh, yeah.

1640
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:06,870
That girl is fine in motion.

1641
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,150
Wait, what do you mean I got her?

1642
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,150
Yippee!

1643
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,720
Why is she so good?

1644
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:40,460
I spent so many re-rolls.

1645
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:49,100
Yeah, but I can't get Seiya at all in Blue Archive, you guys.

1646
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:49,670
So I just...

1647
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,040
Oh, my luck went to Umemusume!

1648
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,040
Instead of the game that I actually play.

1649
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:55,500
Okay.

1650
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,520
I won't Seiya.

1651
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,460
I won't Seiya.

1652
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:08,260
Oh, my luck went to horses.

1653
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,420
Time to main horse girls.

1654
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:13,840
Okay.

1655
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:14,780
Let's try.

1656
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,560
The ten, ten scout ho- horse.

1657
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,300
Okay.

1658
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:34,270
Is there a way to tell?

1659
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,090
Beforehand... I still can't say her name.

1660
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:02,390
She looks like a... a girl from... Oh my gosh.

1661
01:30:03,050 --> 01:30:03,630
Honda Mio.

1662
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:10,310
It can still flip?

1663
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:10,870
It will count?

1664
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:12,870
Agnes.

1665
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:13,170
Oh!

1666
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:13,250
Oh!

1667
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:14,610
Tack.

1668
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,630
Knowledge.

1669
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:19,310
Nice nature.

1670
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:21,830
Vodka.

1671
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:26,250
Mejiro Rhyme.

1672
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:28,650
Unana again.

1673
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:30,830
Nice nature again.

1674
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:32,770
Super Creek.

1675
01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:37,690
Just got home from Lurk.

1676
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,090
No idea what's going on.

1677
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,990
But congrats on the pool.

1678
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:41,090
Thanks to our girl.

1679
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,570
I don't know what's going on either.

1680
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,790
I want 3 star.

1681
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,060
I want 3 star.

1682
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,160
Should I try again?

1683
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,380
Add 10 trainees.

1684
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,560
One more.

1685
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:20,580
But um... You know how like in some gacha games... Before you see the gates... Like before you see what... Is... Uh... Um... Like if it's gold or...

1686
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:24,560
SSR or anything... You... Sometimes there's like a little indicator.

1687
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,840
The hallway changes, I think.

1688
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:30,860
The banner on top of the stable.

1689
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,180
Ah... Okay.

1690
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:33,520
Okay.

1691
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:37,140
The door... Could be... Go... Why?

1692
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,000
There's so many indicators?

1693
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,400
There are multiple hints in Uma.

1694
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,660
Sometimes the director will open the door.

1695
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:45,760
Ah... Okay.

1696
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,020
Okay.

1697
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,200
Oh, wow.

1698
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:47,540
Wait.

1699
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,980
So they're all... It's all kind of different.

1700
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,540
Oh, interesting.

1701
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,240
That's fine.

1702
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,600
Minto, buddy.

1703
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,700
Could you rub some of your streamer luck off on me when I pull for saber?

1704
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,620
I need my luck.

1705
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,760
For... For Blue Archive.

1706
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,300
Please.

1707
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,260
Okay.

1708
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,100
Let's try.

1709
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:09,860
One more.

1710
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:20,730
So.

1711
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:31,670
Streamer luck, they said.

1712
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,730
Streamer luck, they said.

1713
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:37,270
That's a lot of gray.

1714
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,540
What is... What is good about pulling a character multiple times?

1715
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,720
Can you like...

1716
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:57,580
Can you...

1717
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,040
Enhance them more?

1718
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,080
Raise their star.

1719
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:02,400
Okay.

1720
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:25,870
Okay.

1721
01:33:25,910 --> 01:33:25,910
Okay.

1722
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:26,230
One more.

1723
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:26,530
One more.

1724
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,830
Air Groove.

1725
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:12,030
Air Groove twice!

1726
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:25,130
Air Groove is great.

1727
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,990
Oh, yeah?

1728
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:26,090
Air Groove now.

1729
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:31,670
Weeef...

1730
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:31,930
Okay.

1731
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,250
Well, I got top gun.

1732
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:34,410
So...

1733
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,690
Happy about that.

1734
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,790
I didn't get a three star.

1735
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:39,250
It's support time.

1736
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:39,510
Yeah.

1737
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:40,910
Let's do some support cards.

1738
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:44,270
I believe...

1739
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:01,630
It's so...

1740
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:02,310
It flipped.

1741
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,760
Ow, the twin turbo is so cute.

1742
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:10,560
Oh my gosh.

1743
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:12,740
I

1744
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,530
wanted her too!

1745
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:22,730
Top Gun!

1746
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:28,810
Nice nature.

1747
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:33,250
And I got Lady.

1748
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:38,730
Okay.

1749
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:47,090
We got better luck here than... We got... We got way better luck here than... When trying to pull Umbais.

1750
01:35:59,740 --> 01:36:02,160
Metal luck only, no waifu luck.

1751
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,720
Here I'm just like, oh yeah, waifu over metal.

1752
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,860
And the game said no.

1753
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,340
You will metal.

1754
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,840
Why does Mint have horse ears?

1755
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,240
I'm a horse today.

1756
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,020
Support cards are way more important.

1757
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:23,940
Is that really the case?

1758
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,720
They're that important in this game?

1759
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:30,400
Should I... Should I try for more or...

1760
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,640
Yeah, it's very.

1761
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,200
Yeah, you want support.

1762
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,260
Oh... Support cards over Umbais?

1763
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,180
Big fan of Umba.

1764
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,000
Mintzume.

1765
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:51,990
Horses aren't even that important.

1766
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:56,250
But I like to look at...

1767
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,640
You have 6 SP cards, only one Umba.

1768
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:15,660
What do you mean, one Umba?

1769
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:16,420
Oh, wait.

1770
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,000
Oh, I get it.

1771
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,810
More girls' cards than scouts.

1772
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,190
Should I try one more?

1773
01:37:33,730 --> 01:37:34,250
Scout.

1774
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:37,910
How much?

1775
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,190
How much?

1776
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:39,530
Actually, I don't know how much I have left.

1777
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:42,390
I can do one more.

1778
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:45,450
One more support card.

1779
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:50,290
Okay.

1780
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:53,330
Ikimasu.

1781
01:37:58,150 --> 01:37:58,670
Oh.

1782
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:01,890
Cute.

1783
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:15,450
She's cute.

1784
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:18,430
Okay, this one again.

1785
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:19,910
Is there any...

1786
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,150
Any...

1787
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:24,510
Benefit to getting dupes?

1788
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,030
My favorite is Rice Shower.

1789
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,250
But if you have to have successful career mode, run with her.

1790
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:30,510
No!

1791
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:34,530
You can uncap.

1792
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:35,030
Oh, okay.

1793
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:39,490
I got...

1794
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:40,070
This one again.

1795
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:43,010
And this one.

1796
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:45,010
Ignore the stairs.

1797
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:50,010
Well, there we go.

1798
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:52,530
Flash is good.

1799
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,790
Nice.

1800
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:56,330
Okay.

1801
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:59,050
Overall, it wasn't so bad.

1802
01:38:59,390 --> 01:38:59,650
All right.

1803
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:00,110
Okay.

1804
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:00,710
Now.

1805
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:05,490
Now...

1806
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:07,690
Oh, I obtained some cards.

1807
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:08,130
I did.

1808
01:39:08,530 --> 01:39:09,190
Let's get our...

1809
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,960
Not enough, I think, though.

1810
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,300
Oh, okay.

1811
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,500
Now we need horses.

1812
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:25,660
I got some horses!

1813
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:26,140
No!

1814
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:38,560
I want to use Top Gun!

1815
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,850
Shop button.

1816
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:44,510
What's that?

1817
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:48,490
Oh, I see it.

1818
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:52,810
Go, go, go, go!

1819
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:13,260
I wish...

1820
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:19,890
I wish that they would choose for me.

1821
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:35,270
Close your eyes!

1822
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:39,970
Here, I'll do a... I'll do a, uh, what's it called?

1823
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,150
A wheel, a spin wheel.

1824
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:12,480
Suzuka...

1825
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:19,240
Teyo...

1826
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:25,270
Maruzensuke...

1827
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:31,550
Nocap...

1828
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:32,890
Taiki Shuttle is a good choice.

1829
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:37,030
She's a short track racer and has a bunch of English into her dialogue because she's from Kentucky.

1830
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,910
Shuttle...

1831
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:44,340
Mejiro...

1832
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,120
My queen.

1833
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:50,450
Rudolph...

1834
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:51,330
You're a reindeer.

1835
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:52,450
You're not a horse.

1836
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:53,450
Get out of here.

1837
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:56,550
Rice shower...

1838
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:01,600
I spin.

1839
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:12,460
Oh!

1840
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,180
Wait, I gotta show you...

1841
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,380
I did it on my phone.

1842
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:18,200
I should've done it here.

1843
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:18,500
You know what?

1844
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,320
I'm gonna redo it on here.

1845
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:21,200
So that you guys can see.

1846
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,020
Hold on.

1847
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,720
I don't know why I did it on my phone.

1848
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,280
Okay, hold on.

1849
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:29,650
I'm stupid.

1850
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:30,470
Sorry, guys.

1851
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:34,010
Okay.

1852
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:34,410
Special...

1853
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:36,550
Week...

1854
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:37,870
Oh, hold on.

1855
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,070
Actually, let me...

1856
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:15,090
Special Week...

1857
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:19,010
Uh...

1858
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:20,850
Suzuka...

1859
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:25,150
Hail...

1860
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:25,750
Ha, dog!

1861
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:26,830
Maruzen...

1862
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,210
Skill...

1863
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:30,830
Nocap...

1864
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:32,690
Shuttle...

1865
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:33,130
Mejiro...

1866
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:34,130
My queen...

1867
01:43:36,990 --> 01:43:37,670
Rudolph...

1868
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:38,350
Rice shower...

1869
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:40,090
Okay.

1870
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:40,990
Ha, dog!

1871
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:42,190
That's not a choice.

1872
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:44,950
Shuttle got a revolver.

1873
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:47,490
Well...

1874
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:47,530
Well...

1875
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:49,570
Okay, so on my phone, I was gonna show you...

1876
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:50,950
Because it was like...

1877
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:52,870
I thought it was gonna be...

1878
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,950
I thought it was gonna be...

1879
01:43:57,210 --> 01:43:57,570
Um...

1880
01:43:57,570 --> 01:43:58,250
The...

1881
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:58,710
Uh...

1882
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:00,650
It was like, right in the middle.

1883
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:02,890
So I couldn't tell if it was gonna be...

1884
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:04,330
Nocap or Shuttle.

1885
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,950
Okay, here we go.

1886
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,830
We make our own gacha.

1887
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,370
I don't want a reindeer!

1888
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:16,210
Ah!

1889
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,200
Two out of three?

1890
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:34,140
Okay, yeah.

1891
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,900
Who said that?

1892
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:35,260
Me?

1893
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:35,680
No.

1894
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:37,280
I heard someone say two out of three.

1895
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:38,120
Yeah, you're so right.

1896
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:43,680
Yeah, it was a practice roll to show you guys how it works.

1897
01:44:57,430 --> 01:44:58,150
Special Week...

1898
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:00,800
Trigged!

1899
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,520
No, we said two out of three, everybody!

1900
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,160
Here's the third one!

1901
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:16,090
Third time's the charm they say!

1902
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:25,380
You know, that saying...

1903
01:45:25,550 --> 01:45:27,220
Truly is a classic one.

1904
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:29,200
And I think...

1905
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:29,840
Applies.

1906
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,220
Anyway...

1907
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:37,860
Her child!

1908
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,480
The wheel saith...

1909
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,700
And I...

1910
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:48,960
Doeth as the wheel...

1911
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:49,480
Sayeth.

1912
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:00,090
Justice for Rudolph!

1913
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:06,190
Yeah, but look how pretty McQueen is!

1914
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:08,990
Ka-chow the queen!

1915
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:11,630
Rudolph isn't a horse!

1916
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:13,570
Rudolph is...

1917
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:15,910
Who let her into this academy?

1918
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:24,210
Way to make your own luck, Minto.

1919
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:24,510
Hehehe.

1920
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:30,720
A lot of work just to make my queen.

1921
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:31,640
Hehehe.

1922
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,420
Shou, no one, ha-da-me.

1923
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,600
Tate no eeyo he muke.

1924
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:43,640
Hehehe!

1925
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:56,470
Hehehe!

1926
01:46:57,970 --> 01:46:58,130
Hehehe!

1927
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:00,850
She's just so pretty.

1928
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:05,070
Uuuhhh.

1929
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:06,090
Okay.

1930
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:08,670
Koukan, Arigatou gozaimasu.

1931
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:08,670
What?

1932
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:11,890
Friend point.

1933
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:15,770
Ooh, it's so cute.

1934
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:17,530
Support point.

1935
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:19,890
Ooh, who wants to be my friend?

1936
01:47:20,170 --> 01:47:21,050
Wait, can I have friends?

1937
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,900
Who wants to be my friend?

1938
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,880
I can have 15 friends.

1939
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,560
Wait, search rec... Search for recommended.

1940
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,300
Oh.

1941
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,760
A bunch of bots.

1942
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,260
What are these?

1943
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:46,660
This is a bunch of bots.

1944
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:54,210
Justice for Wolfie.

1945
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:56,670
Wolfie's the only real one here.

1946
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,960
It's literally a bunch of bots.

1947
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,360
Oh my gosh, can you imagine if this was Cole from chat?

1948
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,440
Here's my friend code.

1949
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,920
Oh, I'm not taking friend codes.

1950
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:20,620
You add me.

1951
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:23,260
Thank you, Karla Mom.

1952
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,520
You add me.

1953
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:29,000
Wait.

1954
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:30,600
How do I find my ID?

1955
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:32,360
A profile?

1956
01:48:39,730 --> 01:48:40,590
Oh!

1957
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:52,770
525-801-167-742.

1958
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:11,280
Do I have any friend requests?

1959
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:14,500
Oh!

1960
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:22,200
Hey!

1961
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,800
Um... How

1962
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:34,090
do I... What

1963
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:42,270
about friends?

1964
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:44,390
I

1965
01:49:56,510 --> 01:49:57,830
recognize names here.

1966
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:00,830
You follow back for friends.

1967
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:01,270
Ah!

1968
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:02,370
Oh!

1969
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:04,730
I can only follow 15!

1970
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:06,150
Right!

1971
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:07,770
Yeah!

1972
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:12,190
I can only follow... 15 of you.

1973
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:15,810
Time to pick the lucky 15 to follow back.

1974
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:17,750
We'll make this gacha too.

1975
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:22,130
We'll make this gacha too.

1976
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:22,210
We'll make this gacha also.

1977
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:26,630
So I will like... Go through... And I'll stop.

1978
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:27,970
And I'll add you.

1979
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:30,270
Should put them all in a wheel.

1980
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:36,210
Wait, now it's at 400!

1981
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:42,990
Okay, I'll give you guys a couple of minutes if you want to be included in the... In the gacha.

1982
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:44,550
Random

1983
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,180
number generator.

1984
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,520
But there's... They're

1985
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:54,730
not...

1986
01:50:54,730 --> 01:51:00,010
How did some of you guys add me when it said... Last logged in two hours ago?

1987
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:02,230
How did you log in?

1988
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:09,050
What was my ID again?

1989
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:09,610
What was my ID again?

1990
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:14,420
What was my ID?

1991
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:18,020
525...

1992
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:20,100
801...

1993
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:21,820
167...

1994
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,960
742... I feel like I'm giving out my phone number.

1995
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:25,940
It's making me nervous.

1996
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:32,220
It's making me... It's making me nervous.

1997
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,280
It's making me nervous.

1998
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,600
Oh my gosh.

1999
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:39,480
Wait.

2000
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:42,720
You can't like message people in this, right?

2001
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:45,740
Actually you can't in these games.

2002
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:49,640
No?

2003
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,760
Okay, cool.

2004
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,380
I figured no.

2005
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:57,980
Only clubs.

2006
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,120
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2007
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,020
I thought about maybe...

2008
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:02,340
Making a...

2009
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,360
Club for Blue Archive.

2010
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,840
Maybe we can make one for Umu Musume too.

2011
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:17,600
You can go ahead and roll that wheel now.

2012
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,140
You're already at maximum followers.

2013
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,360
Why is the maximum follower 658?

2014
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:26,340
What?

2015
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:30,000
You follow someone you can use your star Uma for Americans.

2016
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:32,380
Making your Uma's career races easier.

2017
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,940
Max is 1k.

2018
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:40,240
I don't... It only showed...

2019
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,400
Oh, it's slowly...

2020
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,560
It's slowly pouring in.

2021
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,760
Thank you guys for following me.

2022
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,960
Wait, I think I had a...

2023
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:58,860
While it's still updated, so I'll go grab this.

2024
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:05,260
Wait, what do I get?

2025
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:09,300
I can be an idol?

2026
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,740
I'm a popular kid.

2027
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:13,760
Wait, I want to be a popular kid.

2028
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,800
Where's my title?

2029
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:19,780
Oh, here we go.

2030
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,600
I'm a popular kid!

2031
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,440
Okay.

2032
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,340
It's still...

2033
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:46,440
Updating, I think.

2034
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,420
But I'll start following people...

2035
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:50,620
And then I'll leave them.

2036
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:51,380
Alright.

2037
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:03,040
You!

2038
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,840
Oh, sorry.

2039
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:08,020
Um...

2040
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,080
Okay, never...

2041
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:10,260
Still done.

2042
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,160
Crispy!

2043
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,560
Follow.

2044
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:22,760
Let's have fun.

2045
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:30,210
Don't you want to follow Northern Lion?

2046
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:31,870
I don't know...

2047
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:34,110
I don't know...

2048
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:35,170
Everybody was following...

2049
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:35,730
Or...

2050
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:41,050
Camelon!

2051
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:41,410
You!

2052
01:54:43,390 --> 01:54:43,850
Follow.

2053
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:50,460
Yeah, I know...

2054
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:51,140
Mostly because of Nimi.

2055
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:57,440
Multiple!

2056
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:58,380
You!

2057
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:12,090
Zero!

2058
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:13,090
You!

2059
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:20,650
Let's see if it updated.

2060
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:24,950
Wait, what's this?

2061
01:55:27,130 --> 01:55:28,650
I changed my title.

2062
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:31,890
Sorry, I'm obsessive with collecting these usually in games.

2063
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:34,630
If it pops up, I'm like, I'm like, yes.

2064
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:36,930
Oh my god, I was picked.

2065
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:39,650
Tanya!

2066
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:39,810
Tanya!

2067
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:45,830
I don't recognize some... Some of you guys use your names, but some of you don't.

2068
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:48,390
Are you guys sure that I'm maxed out?

2069
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:49,450
It only says 800.

2070
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:01,690
S-Dawg.

2071
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,990
Wait.

2072
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:06,150
You're right above Macmillan.

2073
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:08,290
Maybe I need to... Okay, hold on.

2074
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:11,870
I will add you because I said so, but...

2075
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:13,310
I'm hungry.

2076
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:16,030
But... But I need to shuffle better.

2077
01:56:22,190 --> 01:56:23,610
I need to shuffle better.

2078
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:25,010
Totally not rigged.

2079
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:25,470
It's not!

2080
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:27,890
You can change the sword?

2081
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:29,030
Oh, you're right.

2082
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:31,410
We'll do that too.

2083
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:39,390
Even in just the first screen, there's so much to process.

2084
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:40,650
Enjoy your horsing around.

2085
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:41,350
Thank you!

2086
01:56:42,050 --> 01:56:42,850
Thank you, thank you.

2087
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:43,490
I lied.

2088
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:45,170
It was actually I who was already...

2089
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,110
Following the max number of people.

2090
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:47,970
Ah!

2091
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:52,490
Skeletom telling lies.

2092
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:55,050
Telling lies!

2093
01:56:57,350 --> 01:56:58,210
Jade!

2094
01:56:59,190 --> 01:56:59,930
You!

2095
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:02,870
You're an UmaPuy legend!

2096
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:05,110
Um...

2097
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:05,690
Buston?

2098
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,120
Uh...

2099
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:12,600
You!

2100
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:18,740
You!

2101
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,720
Your cheek's at the skin.

2102
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:20,400
What's that mean?

2103
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:23,830
I can't!

2104
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:24,470
You!

2105
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:27,190
Horses.

2106
01:57:29,150 --> 01:57:30,470
How many do I have left?

2107
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:34,250
Seven left.

2108
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:39,840
F...

2109
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:40,700
F...

2110
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:41,020
F...

2111
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,040
Fuzzy!

2112
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:43,260
Fuzzy!

2113
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:44,680
You!

2114
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,180
Oh, wait.

2115
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:56,000
It's still going.

2116
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:57,820
Oh.

2117
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:58,540
Wait.

2118
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:01,320
Even when I scroll to the end, do you see that?

2119
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:01,420
What?

2120
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:07,090
It's not looping, is it?

2121
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:10,430
Oh.

2122
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:14,330
It's...

2123
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:14,910
So many!

2124
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:16,330
It's for horses.

2125
01:58:17,050 --> 01:58:17,310
Hahahaha.

2126
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:23,760
Okay.

2127
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,200
Decker!

2128
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:26,000
Ew!

2129
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:35,920
There's 800 plus to go through.

2130
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:38,500
I thought that we were reaching the end, but we weren't.

2131
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,720
I'm a popular kid.

2132
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:44,640
Hahahaha.

2133
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:45,620
Hahahaha.

2134
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:46,280
Taiku, you!

2135
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:53,480
I want to find someone that has the highest rank.

2136
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:54,740
Let's see.

2137
01:58:58,440 --> 01:58:58,960
E...

2138
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:00,420
C!

2139
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:03,720
I haven't even seen my name.

2140
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:08,860
I see names that I recognize, but then some of you guys go by different names.

2141
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:09,480
I guess.

2142
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:11,740
For your games!

2143
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,160
I'm B2.

2144
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:17,820
You can sort?

2145
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:18,900
Oh yeah, I tried though.

2146
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,740
It only lets me sort by this.

2147
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:26,870
Filter by rank?

2148
01:59:27,370 --> 01:59:27,870
Oh?

2149
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,840
Hold it?

2150
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,240
I

2151
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:39,850
am holding it!

2152
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:42,610
You can't!

2153
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:43,610
Hahahaha.

2154
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,300
I'm telling lies.

2155
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:50,860
For those wanting to...

2156
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:51,260
And...

2157
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:52,080
And to...

2158
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:52,740
And to...

2159
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:55,180
525...

2160
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:57,220
801...

2161
01:59:59,300 --> 01:59:59,660
167...

2162
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:00,940
742...

2163
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:02,220
Okay, I'm gonna get...

2164
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:02,400
Over...

2165
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:02,980
I'm gonna do this...

2166
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:03,380
Oh, whoops.

2167
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:08,140
Let's do this so that I can...

2168
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:10,660
So that I can play.

2169
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:11,760
And I gotta race.

2170
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:12,500
I wanna race.

2171
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:17,040
Wait, I have to get through all of it though.

2172
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:20,660
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

2173
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:22,420
Meow, meow,

2174
02:00:27,530 --> 02:00:28,010
meow, meow.

2175
02:00:28,530 --> 02:00:29,630
Meow, meow, meow.

2176
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,580
Aurelia, you!

2177
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:42,480
Oh, whoops.

2178
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,420
Sorry, I accidentally clicked you.

2179
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:44,980
Oh, there we go.

2180
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:46,960
Okay, three more.

2181
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:47,660
And then we'll play.

2182
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,620
Pineapple, you!

2183
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:00,950
Minto leaks her...

2184
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:02,930
Social security number live on stream.

2185
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:06,550
Yeah, but if you used it, you would be committing fraud.

2186
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:08,350
Because I'm a dead person.

2187
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,780
You would be committing fraud.

2188
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:25,360
Legion, you!

2189
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:28,540
D-Rank!

2190
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:30,380
Where?

2191
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,390
No, no.

2192
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:39,670
Wait a second.

2193
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:40,510
Again?

2194
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:41,510
How did I land next?

2195
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:41,910
Sorry.

2196
02:01:42,550 --> 02:01:44,230
I'm trying to get away from the...

2197
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:44,930
Oh...

2198
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:46,410
Okay, hold on.

2199
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:47,610
Alright,

2200
02:01:57,640 --> 02:01:59,420
I'm trying to get even spacing.

2201
02:01:59,660 --> 02:01:59,820
Yo!

2202
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:00,920
Alex!

2203
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,460
Aw, Alex, I'm sorry.

2204
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:11,740
I'm sorry!

2205
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:18,610
I didn't notice.

2206
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:20,150
Well, okay.

2207
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:21,670
Alright, guys.

2208
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:22,270
Let's see.

2209
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,790
So, if I enhance...

2210
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:34,110
I want to do...

2211
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:35,550
I want to do...

2212
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:36,690
I want to focus on...

2213
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:37,890
Top Gun.

2214
02:02:39,290 --> 02:02:39,890
For...

2215
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:40,410
For...

2216
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,910
First place kiss?

2217
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:49,800
So, first we do the support cards though, right?

2218
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,220
Which...

2219
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:56,200
Wait.

2220
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:57,820
Which one was it?

2221
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:04,360
What does this do?

2222
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:07,100
Money...

2223
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:07,720
Ah...

2224
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,280
Unshu...

2225
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,980
Okay, so this is where we collect stuff.

2226
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:11,140
Okay, okay.

2227
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,520
We collect stuff from the races.

2228
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,480
Okay, okay.

2229
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:15,580
I'm going through everything.

2230
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:17,300
Back one more.

2231
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:18,200
Ah, here we go.

2232
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:18,760
Support card.

2233
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:21,440
So, uncap?

2234
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,840
We have a lot.

2235
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:25,460
Wait.

2236
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:26,740
What was the good one that I got?

2237
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:26,980
I got it.

2238
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:28,200
This one was pretty good, right?

2239
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:28,480
No?

2240
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,500
Okay, uncap.

2241
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:32,320
Uncap.

2242
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:37,660
Fine motion.

2243
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:39,900
Which one was that?

2244
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:44,460
Oh, if I saw it...

2245
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:49,240
This one.

2246
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:50,180
This one.

2247
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:50,260
Yeah.

2248
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:52,060
Wait, but I can't uncap this one.

2249
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:52,300
Okay.

2250
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:53,140
Because I don't have it.

2251
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:54,240
But we can level up.

2252
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,920
It's money and SP.

2253
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:05,280
Okay.

2254
02:04:07,160 --> 02:04:08,200
Is there...

2255
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,640
Any reason not to level it...

2256
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:11,480
Not to max it?

2257
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,720
High level good.

2258
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,900
I feel like I should be reading what these do.

2259
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:30,980
Mood effect and race bonus.

2260
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:31,400
Okay.

2261
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:32,680
All right.

2262
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:33,680
Let's do...

2263
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:35,400
Uh...

2264
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,580
This one too?

2265
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:38,580
Well, this one.

2266
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:45,220
Super-chan dozo.

2267
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:46,760
Arigatou.

2268
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,380
Thank you.

2269
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:53,520
Read.

2270
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:54,140
What's that?

2271
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:55,380
Really?

2272
02:04:55,380 --> 02:05:01,160
Hey, just as long as the card is good, you can figure it out as you play.

2273
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:01,840
Okay.

2274
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:05,860
Oh yeah, I can't.

2275
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:06,220
I can't.

2276
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,360
We'll just do our SSRs too.

2277
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:23,560
Wait, so how many...

2278
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:27,400
How many cards do you have?

2279
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,060
How many support cards is it for?

2280
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:30,500
Wait, let's level up.

2281
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,180
Oh, duh.

2282
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:32,060
What I was just doing.

2283
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:32,600
I'm stupid.

2284
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:33,320
Sorry.

2285
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,000
Five?

2286
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,160
And then one of your friends.

2287
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:43,460
Okay.

2288
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:45,960
So let's level up this one too.

2289
02:05:54,430 --> 02:05:57,250
Cute plus cute equals...

2290
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:00,330
Finish uncapping.

2291
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,970
Wait, do I have others that I cannot cap?

2292
02:06:05,110 --> 02:06:06,290
Does it say if I can?

2293
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:11,250
Wait, I don't remember which ones I...

2294
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,080
Sort by uncapped.

2295
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:20,850
Oh wait, possible?

2296
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:27,150
Oh!

2297
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:27,830
Oh!

2298
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:33,850
It'll show the horseshoe icon.

2299
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:35,390
Ah, see, that's what that is.

2300
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:36,350
Okay, I didn't notice that.

2301
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:39,870
Oh, there's the one.

2302
02:06:39,870 --> 02:06:41,950
I said... It literally says...

2303
02:06:41,950 --> 02:06:43,170
I just... I'm just not reading.

2304
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:44,970
I just... I'm just not reading.

2305
02:06:46,490 --> 02:06:46,960
Okay...

2306
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:08,060
And then...

2307
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:08,620
Well...

2308
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:09,740
Probably though...

2309
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:12,910
Oh wait, oh...

2310
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:15,800
Like...

2311
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:17,180
Well, this one...

2312
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:18,100
Would be good.

2313
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:21,980
Oh!

2314
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,020
Oh!

2315
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:23,180
Yes!

2316
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,640
I don't have enough SP!

2317
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:28,840
No!

2318
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:37,600
Super Chariot!

2319
02:07:45,590 --> 02:07:47,710
I'll just go up as high as I can.

2320
02:07:49,890 --> 02:07:50,850
Okay.

2321
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:59,250
Maybe we'll get more healing.

2322
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:01,110
Maybe we'll get more healing.

2323
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,640
Release mission...

2324
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,120
We...

2325
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:11,720
We got a little bit more!

2326
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:13,400
I knew it.

2327
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,300
Hahahaha...

2328
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:19,020
Support...

2329
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:20,400
Number Number...

2330
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:21,840
You...

2331
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:23,700
Select...

2332
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:23,960
Ugh!

2333
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:27,920
Not...

2334
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:30,410
Totally, but we still had...

2335
02:08:33,350 --> 02:08:34,400
Just, uh...

2336
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:35,440
We just needed...

2337
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:36,360
A little bit more.

2338
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:40,980
Yeah.

2339
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:42,840
Okay.

2340
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,160
Okie dokie.

2341
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:49,960
Now... Wait.

2342
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:58,000
So then if I... Do I have to level these girls up too?

2343
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,720
Or... I guess we'll go with McQueen.

2344
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,480
Career events.

2345
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,220
Late night fan service training.

2346
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,980
No, interesting.

2347
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:13,000
Not yet.

2348
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:14,280
So I don't have to level them.

2349
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:16,760
It's all... So that's why the skills are... Like the cards.

2350
02:09:16,940 --> 02:09:18,180
The support cards are so important.

2351
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:22,600
Potential level one.

2352
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:28,680
So... Wait.

2353
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:29,420
Do I go to career?

2354
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:37,020
And then I would choose... McQueen?

2355
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:38,520
Yeah?

2356
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:38,940
Ok.

2357
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:39,200
Ok.

2358
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:40,360
Ok.

2359
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:41,600
Whoa.

2360
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:42,620
Legacy.

2361
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:42,920
Let's see.

2362
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:48,140
I guess we would choose... Daiwa, right?

2363
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:49,940
With her F rank.

2364
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,320
Just auto for now?

2365
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:53,860
Wait.

2366
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,240
How do I... Where'd the auto go?

2367
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:58,480
Oh!

2368
02:09:58,880 --> 02:09:59,920
I have you guys too!

2369
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:01,040
Whoa!

2370
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:02,860
Holy moly!

2371
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:09,220
Wait.

2372
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:10,080
Where's the auto button?

2373
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:12,580
Back one screen.

2374
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:13,080
Oh!

2375
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,760
Thank you.

2376
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:16,980
Wait.

2377
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,200
How much does it cost for... Friends?

2378
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:20,580
Does it cost?

2379
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:26,670
Not too much?

2380
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:27,290
Ok!

2381
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:31,590
Not so much.

2382
02:10:31,870 --> 02:10:40,010
I guess in the... In the... In the... Long run?

2383
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:41,330
It doesn't... You know?

2384
02:10:42,970 --> 02:10:43,530
Yeah.

2385
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:44,810
You make it back very easily?

2386
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:45,170
Ok!

2387
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:46,070
Friends!

2388
02:10:46,070 --> 02:10:46,610
Friends!

2389
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:56,200
I guess... I guess... I guess I start... I'm scared!

2390
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,640
Can't change Friends card to Super Creek?

2391
02:10:59,520 --> 02:10:59,940
Oh!

2392
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:00,900
Oh!

2393
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:01,240
Wait.

2394
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:01,920
How do I change it?

2395
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:02,520
Oh!

2396
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:02,840
Here we go.

2397
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:06,540
Borrowing?

2398
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:07,540
Sorry, Jaith.

2399
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:08,880
The people... Oh!

2400
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:10,820
I don't have a... I don't have one.

2401
02:11:20,090 --> 02:11:20,570
Refresh?

2402
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:29,610
Let's see... What would it be under?

2403
02:11:29,850 --> 02:11:30,790
If I have rarity?

2404
02:11:32,190 --> 02:11:34,270
I don't even... Don't even... It's an SSR, no?

2405
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:43,780
Filter SSR.

2406
02:11:51,190 --> 02:11:52,350
It's like stamina.

2407
02:12:04,950 --> 02:12:06,290
Are you winning yet, me?

2408
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:10,090
I'm confused, but I'll get the hang of it eventually.

2409
02:12:12,930 --> 02:12:14,430
What does it even look like?

2410
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,300
Uh... Rarity wrong horse franchise.

2411
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:32,970
It's a busty horse.

2412
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:34,710
Oh, yeah.

2413
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:34,750
Oh, yeah.

2414
02:12:40,070 --> 02:12:41,490
Um... Filter by SSR.

2415
02:12:41,550 --> 02:12:42,270
It wouldn't let me.

2416
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:49,660
See?

2417
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:53,140
It won't let me do stamina and... Well, I'll just try the SSR, I guess.

2418
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,880
It filters based on results, not the other way around.

2419
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:22,640
Oh!

2420
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:23,540
That's so... Wait.

2421
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:24,280
That's so lame.

2422
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:28,620
Oh!

2423
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,140
No way.

2424
02:13:33,160 --> 02:13:36,200
Let me try... Sort by rarity instead.

2425
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:41,160
If that even makes a difference.

2426
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:45,180
Maybe I should've just gone with the card that I had.

2427
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:50,390
Maybe I should've just gone with the card that it was.

2428
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:55,430
Oh!

2429
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:56,530
There it is!

2430
02:13:57,410 --> 02:13:57,850
Yippee!

2431
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:01,130
Okay, we finally got it.

2432
02:14:01,270 --> 02:14:02,650
Okay, we're starting our career.

2433
02:14:04,810 --> 02:14:05,170
Yeah!

2434
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:05,570
Yeah!

2435
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:10,450
We're... We're doing big gains.

2436
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:14,450
This is Tracen Academy.

2437
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:15,570
Oh, we did all this before.

2438
02:14:17,310 --> 02:14:17,670
Skip.

2439
02:14:18,610 --> 02:14:22,310
Well, I guess it'll be different because of... Skip, skip, skip.

2440
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:24,630
Oh, no, wait.

2441
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:29,760
We did... I guess we already did this, huh?

2442
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:30,660
Yeah, it is the same.

2443
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:31,140
Never mind.

2444
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:31,520
Just kidding.

2445
02:14:31,640 --> 02:14:31,720

2555
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:58,890
Skip.

2556
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:04,090
Skip 10 cuts.

2557
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:06,390
Mile aptitude.

2558
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:07,770
Whoa, she's E!

2559
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:12,250
Gain 2 hint level.

2560
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:16,170
11 turns.

2561
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:22,020
Oh, downloading?

2562
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:22,940
What?

2563
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:25,260
We have to download the game?

2564
02:15:28,740 --> 02:15:32,820
At last, Mejiro McQueen's journey to compete in the Twinkle series begins.

2565
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:36,720
She's so pretty!

2566
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:42,100
I'm super psyched for it as well, but first I need to head to the cafeteria for a bite to eat.

2567
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:45,860
Such a wonderful smell.

2568
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:50,680
There's a weightiness to it, yet it's delicate as well.

2569
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:54,840
It's nice and strong.

2570
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,880
It might not even need sugar.

2571
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:57,620
What are you talking?

2572
02:15:57,760 --> 02:15:58,380
What are they...

2573
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:02,640
That's Mejiro Ryan, a member of the noted Mejiro family.

2574
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:02,640
Really?

2575
02:16:02,980 --> 02:16:04,980
She's athletic and radiates energy.

2576
02:16:06,820 --> 02:16:07,460
Sone?

2577
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:09,140
Sone?

2578
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:12,780
The Academy's cafe is rather elaborate, isn't it?

2579
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:14,380
There's so many flavors on the menu.

2580
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:16,740
This is Mejiro Dober.

2581
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:19,220
She is a member of the Mejiro family.

2582
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:20,940
She's a bit hard to please.

2583
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:24,320
L-look!

2584
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:26,500
They're from the Mejiro family!

2585
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:29,940
They're having a high-class conversation!

2586
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:32,220
Just how I thought they'd be!

2587
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:34,420
Oh my gosh, so do some more!

2588
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:36,700
Ben Dober!

2589
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:40,940
Shut up!

2590
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:44,700
Now that I look at them again, they really do have an impressive aura.

2591
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:47,440
They're...

2592
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:47,800
They're...

2593
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:48,100
Um...

2594
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,260
Cafe Maxing.

2595
02:16:55,520 --> 02:16:57,680
And last but not least, my trainee!

2596
02:16:58,100 --> 02:16:59,280
Mejiro McQueen!

2597
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:04,660
What?

2598
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:05,500
What?

2599
02:17:10,910 --> 02:17:15,110
Seeing her in this light, I can really sense the noble air she emits.

2600
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:17,970
Nah, what does she smell like?

2601
02:17:19,410 --> 02:17:22,310
Are you sure you don't want a chocolate pudding crepe McQueen?

2602
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:26,630
Yes, I'm sure!

2603
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:28,770
I'm perfectly fine!

2604
02:17:28,970 --> 02:17:31,290
I brought my own special dessert, you see!

2605
02:17:33,130 --> 02:17:34,330
Special dessert?

2606
02:17:35,730 --> 02:17:36,410
Yes!

2607
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:39,230
I made it myself with nuts in place of flour!

2608
02:17:39,850 --> 02:17:41,630
She's so healthy!

2609
02:17:42,830 --> 02:17:44,890
Low in sugar and high in protein!

2610
02:17:45,210 --> 02:17:46,430
It's very nutritious!

2611
02:17:47,030 --> 02:17:50,570
Above all, the exquisite flavor solidifies it as an exceptional dessert!

2612
02:17:57,730 --> 02:17:58,170
Guys...

2613
02:18:00,510 --> 02:18:03,330
This might be a bad time to say, but my throat's starting to hurt.

2614
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:05,450
Hold on, I'm gonna go get some medicine!

2615
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:08,250
And some more tea.

2616
02:18:08,990 --> 02:18:09,770
I'll be right back.

2617
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:11,230
You watch... you watch Mejiro.

2618
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:13,050
McQueen.

2619
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:14,130
You watch McQueen.

2620
02:18:14,890 --> 02:18:15,430
Watch out!

2621
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:57,000
I'm back, baby!

2622
02:19:57,360 --> 02:19:58,100
Sorry about that.

2623
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:00,680
I came back!

2624
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:02,760
Little cookies!

2625
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:06,260
I haven't been really into anything yet.

2626
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:11,580
I've been really into these ginger snap cookies.

2627
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:17,520
There's so much reading to this if you don't skip.

2628
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:19,760
I was just thinking...

2629
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:24,080
When I was getting this, I was like, I wonder if everybody will be mad if I skip.

2630
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:25,420
Ha ha ha ha!

2631
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:28,120
Ha ha ha!

2632
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:45,020
Ha ha ha!

2633
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:46,140
Let's skip!

2634
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,360
Yippee!

2635
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:50,360
Oh...

2636
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:51,480
How do I skip?

2637
02:20:53,020 --> 02:20:53,420
Hi?

2638
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:56,140
Aw yeah!

2639
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,180
Yippee!

2640
02:20:59,320 --> 02:20:59,760
Yippee!

2641
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:01,340
All right.

2642
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:02,680
Yeah, make any advice first?

2643
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:06,240
I I think I made it!

2644
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,180
Guide your trainee!

2645
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:14,440
Learn skills for raising advantages...

2646
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:15,760
...yup, yup, yup.

2647
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:20,280
When your umomusume is tired or feeling down, try rest or recreation.

2648
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:24,660
Condition cured!

2649
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:28,160
Go to school infirmary to cure negative conditions.

2650
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:30,580
Strike a balance.

2651
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:32,640
Oh my gosh, it really is...

2652
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:36,580
It's... it's... no wonder this is such a popular game.

2653
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:37,700
It's literally...

2654
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:41,000
Like a... a life sim.

2655
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:42,780
One of those balancing sims.

2656
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:47,820
Like a life, I want to use that.

2657
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:49,920
Management sim, yeah.

2658
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:51,480
So...

2659
02:21:52,900 --> 02:21:54,240
I guess we would train!

2660
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:58,700
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

2661
02:21:58,700 --> 02:21:59,760
We train speed?

2662
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:01,040
Or power?

2663
02:22:02,260 --> 02:22:03,200
Power's the lowest.

2664
02:22:12,190 --> 02:22:12,670
Speed?

2665
02:22:14,350 --> 02:22:15,170
There we are.

2666
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:21,560
Look how cute she is in her gym clothes.

2667
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:22,320
Wait, I wanna see...

2668
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:22,900
Whoa!

2669
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:23,660
Whoa!

2670
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:27,000
I didn't know that she could be in a basic suit.

2671
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,220
Guts!

2672
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:30,220
School.

2673
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:34,530
Focus on friends early... How...

2674
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:36,080
Like, what do I do for that?

2675
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:38,160
Would that be skills?

2676
02:22:47,420 --> 02:22:48,040
Tukumizu!

2677
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:50,680
I did say...

2678
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:51,740
Why school over...

2679
02:22:51,740 --> 02:22:53,660
Wait, so is this friends like that?

2680
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:57,740
Or are these my cards?

2681
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,600
Oh, they... Wait, I think these are my cards, no?

2682
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:05,380
The cards, yeah.

2683
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:06,200
The cards.

2684
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:07,060
The cards!

2685
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:10,580
Cards equals friends.

2686
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,400
Oh, we have no friends in speed!

2687
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:16,020
We have friends in power.

2688
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:24,550
Two cards are good.

2689
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:25,790
No...

2690
02:23:26,650 --> 02:23:27,210
No...

2691
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:28,230
Oh...

2692
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:29,230
She's gonna...

2693
02:23:29,950 --> 02:23:31,550
She's gonna learn the breasts...

2694
02:23:32,490 --> 02:23:32,970
Some...

2695
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:34,570
Wait, why can't I say that word?

2696
02:23:36,290 --> 02:23:36,850
The...

2697
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:51,050
Oh, never mind.

2698
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:53,750
Let's do...

2699
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:55,150
You guys said focus on friends.

2700
02:23:55,350 --> 02:23:55,570
So...

2701
02:23:55,570 --> 02:23:56,270
We build...

2702
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:57,590
Build up friends here.

2703
02:23:58,810 --> 02:23:59,370
Kima?

2704
02:23:59,970 --> 02:24:01,190
Not just because she's in...

2705
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:02,030
Oh, she's so fast!

2706
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:02,570
Wait!

2707
02:24:02,570 --> 02:24:03,950
I didn't see what...

2708
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:04,350
Ah!

2709
02:24:05,330 --> 02:24:06,730
It's too...

2710
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:08,150
It's too fast!

2711
02:24:13,330 --> 02:24:14,370
I...

2712
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:15,650
I completely...

2713
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:18,870
I missed her doing...

2714
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:19,630
Swim!

2715
02:24:20,290 --> 02:24:22,010
Because we were swimming.

2716
02:24:22,590 --> 02:24:24,210
I missed it.

2717
02:24:25,070 --> 02:24:25,510
Nooo!

2718
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:29,710
Ah...

2719
02:24:30,910 --> 02:24:34,050
Well, I already missed it, so...

2720
02:24:34,530 --> 02:24:34,970
Okay...

2721
02:24:37,110 --> 02:24:38,410
I can't believe it!

2722
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:42,830
The more friends you have on any given training...

2723
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:43,510
The more you get from it.

2724
02:24:43,570 --> 02:24:44,470
Also, Guts is a...

2725
02:24:44,470 --> 02:24:46,110
Largely useless stat.

2726
02:24:46,510 --> 02:24:47,230
No way!

2727
02:24:49,130 --> 02:24:49,570
Oh!

2728
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:51,430
I see, now I have more friends here!

2729
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:53,670
Oh!

2730
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:54,730
But should I just keep going stamina?

2731
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:57,730
So that we get more?

2732
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:01,330
You can change on the settings...

2733
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:02,410
Not to skip first time events.

2734
02:25:02,530 --> 02:25:03,270
Oh yeah, I think...

2735
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,990
We should do that.

2736
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:06,590
Guts is a dump stat.

2737
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:07,950
Yo!

2738
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:12,590
Hold on, I wanna see...

2739
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:14,670
Uh...

2740
02:25:25,890 --> 02:25:26,530
Very tall?

2741
02:25:27,230 --> 02:25:27,590
Oh!

2742
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:28,130
There we go.

2743
02:25:28,370 --> 02:25:28,690
Thank you.

2744
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:28,750
Yeah.

2745
02:25:30,230 --> 02:25:31,290
I missed it.

2746
02:25:32,330 --> 02:25:32,890
Lucky!

2747
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:33,610
Stamina!

2748
02:25:39,330 --> 02:25:40,370
She did it!

2749
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:41,070
That was it?

2750
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:47,410
Okay, her energy is still good, I think.

2751
02:25:49,710 --> 02:25:51,710
Finally, we can do some spreeeen!

2752
02:25:52,890 --> 02:25:54,910
Okay, no Guts ever, I learned.

2753
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:56,870
Guts suck!

2754
02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:01,410
Energy went down a lot, though.

2755
02:26:02,370 --> 02:26:03,090
We should probably...

2756
02:26:04,530 --> 02:26:05,290
Oh?

2757
02:26:06,810 --> 02:26:08,330
Should probably...

2758
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:08,870
Rest.

2759
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:13,630
They're cute.

2760
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:15,230
Look how cute they are.

2761
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:17,330
What is she wearing?

2762
02:26:18,210 --> 02:26:18,630
Dude!

2763
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:20,730
Uma Musumeis have four ears.

2764
02:26:21,470 --> 02:26:23,210
I tried looking earlier.

2765
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:27,930
Recreation for her mood.

2766
02:26:28,010 --> 02:26:28,210
Oh no!

2767
02:26:28,310 --> 02:26:28,690
Was she sad?

2768
02:26:30,410 --> 02:26:31,090
Oh my god!

2769
02:26:31,290 --> 02:26:31,810
What is happening?

2770
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:35,710
It's like...

2771
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:37,400
You know that meme that's just like...

2772
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:40,210
Never skip a cutscene in...

2773
02:26:44,110 --> 02:26:45,290
In this video game!

2774
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:46,990
Never skip a cutscene in...

2775
02:26:46,990 --> 02:26:48,950
In this video game!

2776
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:55,340
Never skip a Yakuza cutscene!

2777
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:55,700
Never skip a Yakuza cutscene!

2778
02:26:55,700 --> 02:26:56,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2779
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,840
How do you see if she's happy or not?

2780
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:01,980
Yeah, see, she wants to...

2781
02:27:01,980 --> 02:27:05,020
How do you see what her, like, um...

2782
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:10,100
How do you see what, if she's happy or not?

2783
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:11,660
Her mood?

2784
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:16,970
Normal?

2785
02:27:17,790 --> 02:27:19,270
Ah, I see, I see, okay.

2786
02:27:21,450 --> 02:27:22,550
Ah, okay, okay.

2787
02:27:23,890 --> 02:27:25,030
Next... Ah, I see, I see.

2788
02:27:27,490 --> 02:27:28,190
Thanks, guys!

2789
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:35,170
So usually, is she supposed to be at great?

2790
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:36,350
Or good?

2791
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:40,090
Uh...

2792
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:41,610
I'm thinking...

2793
02:27:41,610 --> 02:27:43,450
Wait, does recreation take energy?

2794
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:51,020
Horse girls have only two ears.

2795
02:27:51,180 --> 02:27:51,760
They actually...

2796
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,300
Have to use long phones...

2797
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:54,880
So I can reach their horse ears.

2798
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:57,340
Great is ideal.

2799
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:58,720
Okay, so let's go.

2800
02:28:00,180 --> 02:28:00,820
How...

2801
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,560
Oh, she went to...

2802
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:04,580
A modest...

2803
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:06,220
A modest fortune.

2804
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:08,460
Cute!

2805
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:14,040
Okay, a flyer.

2806
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:15,020
Aquarium?

2807
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:17,340
I wanna go aquarium!

2808
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:21,340
I don't wanna let this opportunity pass us by.

2809
02:28:21,460 --> 02:28:22,800
Grab the flyer and go looking for her.

2810
02:28:24,220 --> 02:28:25,120
I wanna go.

2811
02:28:25,740 --> 02:28:26,880
I went to...

2812
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:28,120
I went to a planetarium...

2813
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:29,660
With...

2814
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:30,500
Ayami Mama.

2815
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:33,300
And, uh...

2816
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:35,900
Here, I'll just have the auto on.

2817
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:38,560
And, um...

2818
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:39,680
Uh...

2819
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:40,080
But...

2820
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:41,440
Obviously it was in Japanese.

2821
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:42,480
But I...

2822
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:44,760
She was kind of...

2823
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:45,940
Clowning on me.

2824
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:47,240
Because I was just like...

2825
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:48,760
Oh, but it's narrated by...

2826
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:51,520
A voice actor that I really like.

2827
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:54,020
Do you guys know Tsuda Kenjiro?

2828
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:58,000
His voice is like absolute butter.

2829
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:58,080
Here.

2830
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:01,620
And so...

2831
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:03,040
I went...

2832
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:04,720
And...

2833
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,420
With her...

2834
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:07,140
And...

2835
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:12,240
I love him!

2836
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:12,660
Right!

2837
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,120
His voice is amazing!

2838
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:15,920
And, um...

2839
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:17,820
So we were...

2840
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,680
But I couldn't barely understand anything.

2841
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:21,380
Because a lot of it was so science-y.

2842
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:22,840
Um...

2843
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:23,360
But...

2844
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:24,340
I was like...

2845
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:26,660
I was really starting to fall asleep during it.

2846
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,260
I was like...

2847
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:28,140
I was like...

2848
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:29,300
He sounds so nice.

2849
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:30,520
And this is so relaxing.

2850
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:32,060
I was like starting to fall asleep.

2851
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:32,540
But I was like...

2852
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:33,480
I won't fall asleep.

2853
02:29:33,580 --> 02:29:34,600
I won't fall asleep.

2854
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:35,800
And then...

2855
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,220
Towards the end...

2856
02:29:37,220 --> 02:29:37,940
Of the...

2857
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:39,080
Like the presentation...

2858
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:40,040
It got really quiet.

2859
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:42,620
It got really quiet.

2860
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:43,360
And...

2861
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:45,840
I just hear some guy behind me...

2862
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:47,580
Hello!

2863
02:29:49,340 --> 02:29:50,700
Wait, where's the aquarium?

2864
02:29:51,620 --> 02:29:52,520
Skip, skip, skip.

2865
02:29:52,660 --> 02:29:52,760
Oh!

2866
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:54,980
Wait, why am I at the aquarium with you?

2867
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,860
That was so silly.

2868
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:06,400
New training partner.

2869
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:09,560
She's on an island.

2870
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:12,200
Oh, the most essential thing for survival is...

2871
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:12,740
Food!

2872
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,000
Our speed went up.

2873
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:19,360
Nice.

2874
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:22,880
So yeah, that's what happened.

2875
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:24,680
We went to the aquarium.

2876
02:30:26,120 --> 02:30:27,220
Is YouTube breaking?

2877
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:28,220
Uh-oh.

2878
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:29,700
Am I alive?

2879
02:30:30,020 --> 02:30:30,740
Well, I'm not.

2880
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:32,580
Is the stream alive?

2881
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:34,900
You guys, I need help!

2882
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:38,300
I'm

2883
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:42,280
on my end.

2884
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:42,780
Oh, okay.

2885
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:47,780
Bye, Phil!

2886
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:48,280
Thank you!

2887
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:48,740
I'm going to go up a little bit.

2888
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:53,280
A training.

2889
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:55,760
Why is it wanting me to do Guts?

2890
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:57,800
Isn't Guts the bad?

2891
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:00,940
Wait, it's a director.

2892
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:02,160
Whoa!

2893
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:03,260
There's so much stamina.

2894
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:08,280
That gives you a skill.

2895
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:12,320
Skill or event.

2896
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:14,700
So I'm guessing that is...

2897
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:16,000
Like, pretty good, right?

2898
02:31:16,860 --> 02:31:18,140
A little Guts is okay.

2899
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:19,740
It's 3% failure.

2900
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,760
You think we'll...

2901
02:31:25,450 --> 02:31:27,510
I'm doing a mirror career run right now.

2902
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:29,210
Every decision Minto makes, I make.

2903
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:29,950
Yeah, but that...

2904
02:31:34,090 --> 02:31:34,930
Sippy reminder.

2905
02:31:35,150 --> 02:31:35,570
Thank you!

2906
02:31:35,710 --> 02:31:36,350
I was just sippin'.

2907
02:31:37,470 --> 02:31:39,150
Okay, we'll do some Guts as a treat.

2908
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:40,250
Success!

2909
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:40,470
Yes!

2910
02:31:41,410 --> 02:31:42,750
Energy went down.

2911
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:44,270
Okay, now we need to sleep.

2912
02:31:50,530 --> 02:31:52,450
Menjiro McQueen has gained something.

2913
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,890
Standard distance.

2914
02:31:55,410 --> 02:31:56,610
And friendship went up.

2915
02:31:57,490 --> 02:31:58,090
Let's go.

2916
02:31:59,450 --> 02:32:00,890
Sporting goods store.

2917
02:32:06,190 --> 02:32:06,990
Oh...

2918
02:32:06,990 --> 02:32:07,910
Shoes.

2919
02:32:08,390 --> 02:32:09,170
Lightweight.

2920
02:32:09,170 --> 02:32:10,090
Oh, wait.

2921
02:32:10,170 --> 02:32:11,610
Ones that are heavy will be great for training.

2922
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:11,810
Yeah.

2923
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:14,850
Do the, uh...

2924
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:15,710
Energy went down.

2925
02:32:16,030 --> 02:32:16,150
Okay.

2926
02:32:23,050 --> 02:32:24,290
You do the...

2927
02:32:24,290 --> 02:32:25,390
The Rock Lee method.

2928
02:32:28,730 --> 02:32:29,250
Okay.

2929
02:32:30,490 --> 02:32:31,010
Okay.

2930
02:32:31,630 --> 02:32:32,430
Now we rest.

2931
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:36,630
Okay.

2932
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:38,030
Night.

2933
02:32:38,070 --> 02:32:38,110
Night.

2934
02:32:38,130 --> 02:32:38,270
Night.

2935
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:39,370
Oh.

2936
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:40,410
All refreshed.

2937
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:42,970
Before I sleep, I often...

2938
02:32:42,970 --> 02:32:43,550
Oh.

2939
02:32:43,810 --> 02:32:44,170
I...

2940
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:53,350
I read that I often lick...

2941
02:32:53,350 --> 02:32:57,250
And then my brain auto-completed the rest of it.

2942
02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:00,170
And...

2943
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:02,670
I thought it was I often...

2944
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:05,190
I often lick...

2945
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:05,570
A...

2946
02:33:05,570 --> 02:33:07,450
A salt lick.

2947
02:33:09,730 --> 02:33:11,330
Because that's what...

2948
02:33:11,330 --> 02:33:11,770
Because that's what...

2949
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:12,370
That's what...

2950
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:13,110
Horses...

2951
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:13,230
Salt...

2952
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:13,530
Wait, no.

2953
02:33:13,650 --> 02:33:14,090
Maybe sugar.

2954
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:19,900
I just...

2955
02:33:19,900 --> 02:33:22,160
I just literally auto-correct...

2956
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,900
Or auto-filled the rest of...

2957
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:25,840
The rest of the sentence.

2958
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:26,880
I...

2959
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:28,160
I read it as...

2960
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:30,420
I combined light and stick into lick.

2961
02:33:30,660 --> 02:33:32,880
And then I auto-completed the rest of it.

2962
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:34,640
In my brain.

2963
02:33:39,730 --> 02:33:41,510
No, she doesn't lick pockets.

2964
02:33:44,510 --> 02:33:45,110
I...

2965
02:33:45,110 --> 02:33:45,470
I...

2966
02:33:45,470 --> 02:33:46,030
I...

2967
02:33:46,030 --> 02:33:46,370
I...

2968
02:33:48,430 --> 02:33:48,730
I...

2969
02:33:50,330 --> 02:33:50,930
I...

2970
02:33:50,930 --> 02:33:51,530
Light...

2971
02:33:51,530 --> 02:33:53,630
A stick of incense...

2972
02:33:53,630 --> 02:33:55,570
Given to me by my grandmother.

2973
02:33:58,690 --> 02:33:59,590
Salt lick.

2974
02:33:59,710 --> 02:34:00,570
Like a sugar cube.

2975
02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:01,450
You know?

2976
02:34:01,630 --> 02:34:02,010
Like a...

2977
02:34:02,010 --> 02:34:02,790
A salt cube.

2978
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:05,830
That's what I was thinking of.

2979
02:34:07,230 --> 02:34:08,810
Oh, calming scent.

2980
02:34:09,850 --> 02:34:10,910
Now she's energized.

2981
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:11,570
Nice.

2982
02:34:12,570 --> 02:34:13,430
Thinking about grandma.

2983
02:34:14,710 --> 02:34:15,870
Beef, pork, chicken...

2984
02:34:16,370 --> 02:34:16,830
Curry.

2985
02:34:21,290 --> 02:34:22,350
She's so cute.

2986
02:34:22,490 --> 02:34:22,910
Tamamo.

2987
02:34:25,090 --> 02:34:26,930
It's not just that she wears a headband.

2988
02:34:27,430 --> 02:34:29,550
But it's kind of that she wears a headband.

2989
02:34:30,650 --> 02:34:31,630
Okay, skip.

2990
02:34:32,030 --> 02:34:32,850
Skippa, skippa.

2991
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:33,650
I want to get to the race.

2992
02:34:34,550 --> 02:34:36,350
I want to get to the race.

2993
02:34:36,530 --> 02:34:38,550
Oh, we have another event thing.

2994
02:34:39,890 --> 02:34:40,830
Under speed.

2995
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:42,910
Alright, let's go.

2996
02:34:43,350 --> 02:34:44,410
Easiest choice ever.

2997
02:34:45,350 --> 02:34:48,350
Play DDR on higher difficulties while wearing a bunch of weights.

2998
02:34:52,770 --> 02:34:53,430
Speed.

2999
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:59,400
She's gained something.

3000
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:01,180
Corner adept.

3001
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:02,700
Wow.

3002
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:04,960
I think we're gonna be...

3003
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:10,020
I think we're gonna be...

3004
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:10,700
The strongest...

3005
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,380
Uma there is.

3006
02:35:15,440 --> 02:35:16,020
Old...

3007
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:17,420
New flavor?

3008
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:18,320
Or chocolate?

3009
02:35:21,020 --> 02:35:23,180
I'm someone who...

3010
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:27,140
I'm the type of ghost that always goes for what I like.

3011
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:28,120
You know?

3012
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:30,920
Like, I always go for the same thing over and over again.

3013
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:40,040
Nice.

3014
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Okay, we have four turns left.

3015
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:45,860
Whoa...

3016
02:35:45,860 --> 02:35:48,280
I'm wondering if we should get the...

3017
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,760
Her mood up more?

3018
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:55,000
I'm wondering if we should try to go for a great stat.

3019
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:58,180
And then train.

3020
02:35:58,500 --> 02:35:59,420
And then train.

3021
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:04,180
Whoa!

3022
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:06,400
Nice!

3023
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:08,060
Oh, we went to a cake place.

3024
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:11,480
Oh, cake.

3025
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:12,500
Wait.

3026
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:14,480
What should I do?

3027
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:15,500
I was totally under...

3028
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:16,520
Utterly unprepared for this.

3029
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:16,960
Don't worry.

3030
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:18,340
Your weight is well under control.

3031
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:20,940
Just do three ramen bowls worth of running later.

3032
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:24,340
Oh, she wants to eat three bowls of ramen.

3033
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:25,960
Me too.

3034
02:36:28,060 --> 02:36:30,660
I can't even finish one bowl of ramen though.

3035
02:36:34,060 --> 02:36:35,840
Guys, what's the great consensus?

3036
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:40,140
So, I eat just a little bit at a time.

3037
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:43,580
And then like two, three hours later, I'm hungry again.

3038
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:47,140
I've been told that that's healthy.

3039
02:36:47,140 --> 02:36:49,640
And then I've also been told that's not healthy.

3040
02:36:51,620 --> 02:36:52,660
Which is it?

3041
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:56,140
That's healthy.

3042
02:36:56,380 --> 02:36:57,220
That's good.

3043
02:36:57,660 --> 02:37:00,040
It's healthier to eat many meals throughout the day.

3044
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:01,300
Ah.

3045
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:03,580
Ha ha ha.

3046
02:37:06,060 --> 02:37:06,540
Ah.

3047
02:37:08,540 --> 02:37:09,560
What are you eating?

3048
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:10,940
I don't know.

3049
02:37:12,020 --> 02:37:12,500
Anything?

3050
02:37:17,070 --> 02:37:18,410
So then I possess...

3051
02:37:18,410 --> 02:37:20,970
It's better too, because I can possess a body and...

3052
02:37:20,970 --> 02:37:22,870
Eat something and then possess someone else.

3053
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:23,970
And then eat something different.

3054
02:37:24,230 --> 02:37:25,930
And then possess someone else and then eat someone different.

3055
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:30,030
So I get a whole...

3056
02:37:30,030 --> 02:37:31,150
Like a buffet.

3057
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:40,820
Last two...

3058
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:43,560
What if she gets sick?

3059
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:46,140
Don't worry, your weight is well under control.

3060
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:47,580
She's happy.

3061
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:48,440
Maybe.

3062
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:50,960
Alright, training!

3063
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,940
Eat someone?

3064
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:56,540
No!

3065
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,700
I said...

3066
02:37:58,060 --> 02:38:00,760
I possess someone to eat...

3067
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:01,520
Food!

3068
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:07,800
I possess someone to eat food!

3069
02:38:10,670 --> 02:38:12,100
I don't eat people!

3070
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:13,920
I don't eat people!

3071
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:16,860
You said eat someone!

3072
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:18,260
No, I didn't!

3073
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,360
I said eat something!

3074
02:38:30,130 --> 02:38:31,430
Did I...

3075
02:38:31,430 --> 02:38:33,250
Did I mess up again?

3076
02:38:45,060 --> 02:38:46,300
Did I...

3077
02:38:46,300 --> 02:38:47,020
Did I...

3078
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:48,560
Did I mess up again?

3079
02:38:58,370 --> 02:38:59,190
Okay.

3080
02:38:59,850 --> 02:39:01,070
Let's do...

3081
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:02,570
Let's do speed.

3082
02:39:02,570 --> 02:39:04,070
Speed!

3083
02:39:04,070 --> 02:39:06,010
Oh wait...

3084
02:39:07,490 --> 02:39:07,870
Power...

3085
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:11,270
Oh, power might be good.

3086
02:39:12,010 --> 02:39:12,390
Oh!

3087
02:39:13,090 --> 02:39:14,890
Why do I need to be smart?

3088
02:39:14,890 --> 02:39:15,950
I'm just running.

3089
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:20,310
Speed?

3090
02:39:25,390 --> 02:39:25,970
Speed?

3091
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:27,410
Why does this one have a little...

3092
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:28,290
Little happy man?

3093
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:33,940
Wait is for skill activation.

3094
02:39:35,020 --> 02:39:35,600
Oh...

3095
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,720
We get so many more skill points too!

3096
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:40,380
Mmm...

3097
02:39:40,380 --> 02:39:41,940
Oh, but we get so much speed here.

3098
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:43,200
Okay, I'm going for speed.

3099
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:47,480
Look how fast she was!

3100
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:51,680
She's so fast!

3101
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:52,840
Otsukaresama desu!

3102
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:54,660
Otsukaresama desu!

3103
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,600
Everyone gets a hankering to eat people sometimes.

3104
02:39:59,140 --> 02:39:59,780
Maybe...

3105
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:02,660
Maybe I should try...

3106
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:04,220
Possessing Hannibal.

3107
02:40:04,220 --> 02:40:05,540
The cannibal.

3108
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:05,560
The cannibal.

3109
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:07,460
She's human.

3110
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:11,380
Yup, I'm heading home.

3111
02:40:12,020 --> 02:40:12,220
Okay.

3112
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:13,060
Goodbye.

3113
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:16,940
Oh, mood remains great.

3114
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:17,540
Awesome.

3115
02:40:19,140 --> 02:40:20,220
They're talking.

3116
02:40:20,910 --> 02:40:21,260
Oh...

3117
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:23,720
Running with a friend is even...

3118
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:26,140
Wait, it's important to train and have fun!

3119
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:28,500
Best of both worlds.

3120
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:32,680
Two days left!

3121
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:33,920
Okay, training?

3122
02:40:36,990 --> 02:40:38,530
I must do wit!

3123
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:40,390
All my friends are there!

3124
02:40:43,770 --> 02:40:44,410
Okay.

3125
02:40:44,910 --> 02:40:45,910
Time for wit.

3126
02:40:46,910 --> 02:40:48,270
Two days left!

3127
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:49,290
Two days left!

3128
02:40:49,530 --> 02:40:51,290
Two days left!

3129
02:40:51,730 --> 02:40:52,330
Two days left!

3130
02:40:52,330 --> 02:40:52,790
A lovely...

3131
02:40:52,790 --> 02:40:53,870
A lively trio!

3132
02:40:57,030 --> 02:40:58,790
Lots and lots of pins!

3133
02:40:59,390 --> 02:41:01,110
Cool, cute, and shiny taboo!

3134
02:41:01,630 --> 02:41:02,590
Wait, who is she?

3135
02:41:05,090 --> 02:41:05,910
Karin-chan?

3136
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:07,850
Wait, she's really cute!

3137
02:41:08,690 --> 02:41:10,250
Wait, she's like...

3138
02:41:10,810 --> 02:41:11,530
Really cute!

3139
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:14,790
Wait, she's so cute!

3140
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:16,570
Dang, she's so tall!

3141
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:23,920
You can't be a real grown-up without keeping up with the latest trends!

3142
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:25,000
Gravelling!

3143
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:27,840
Top Gun is so cute!

3144
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:29,380
Eee!

3145
02:41:30,860 --> 02:41:32,280
Karin is my Hanshi.

3146
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:34,100
Hans-oshi.

3147
02:41:40,180 --> 02:41:40,920
Oh, wait!

3148
02:41:41,020 --> 02:41:42,060
Are they making Ida bag?

3149
02:41:42,460 --> 02:41:43,100
No way!

3150
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:46,560
God, she's really cute!

3151
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:49,540
Uh-oh!

3152
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:53,620
Uh-oh!

3153
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:54,440
Uh-oh!

3154
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,700
No, I like them both, though!

3155
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:04,230
Was it love at first sight?

3156
02:42:05,270 --> 02:42:05,970
I don't know!

3157
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:10,810
Oh my gosh, they're so cute!

3158
02:42:10,810 --> 02:42:12,190
They're gonna get matching pins!

3159
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:46,200
Aw...

3160
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:51,100
Here's my contribution for you to pull...

3161
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:53,960
For Kita-san black support card in the near future.

3162
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:55,140
Thank you!

3163
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,920
In the end, I watched the whole cutscene.

3164
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:01,600
How do you see it?

3165
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:01,840
How do you see it?

3166
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:03,880
I'm always aware of it.

3167
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:08,240
So...

3168
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:09,800
Here's where I'm not sure.

3169
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:11,120
If I need to rest?

3170
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:13,740
Like, is it good to have energy...

3171
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:15,400
At...

3172
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:17,720
As close to max as possible?

3173
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:19,840
Or if it doesn't matter?

3174
02:43:21,140 --> 02:43:21,880
Does it matter?

3175
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:25,440
Oh, train?

3176
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:25,860
Okay!

3177
02:43:26,640 --> 02:43:27,040
Okay!

3178
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:28,600
Let's see...

3179
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:29,000
Speed!

3180
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,680
Speed's looking powerful choice here.

3181
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:34,680
I think we're gonna go speed!

3182
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:38,500
Only for training.

3183
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:38,960
Perfect.

3184
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:49,460
I'm scared.

3185
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:52,580
I'm scared...

3186
02:43:52,580 --> 02:43:54,020
Okay...

3187
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:55,020
We have 240...

3188
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:56,300
Oh...

3189
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:58,220
Excuse me...

3190
02:43:58,220 --> 02:43:59,660
43 skill points.

3191
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:04,720
Certainly increase acceleration will position towards the front of the final corner or later.

3192
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:11,880
Okay chat, teach me the good skills.

3193
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:15,840
Moderately increase performance in spring?

3194
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:18,800
Spring...

3195
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:20,140
Not the season?

3196
02:44:20,660 --> 02:44:22,020
Is that like a...

3197
02:44:26,070 --> 02:44:27,790
Corner adept is good.

3198
02:44:34,480 --> 02:44:37,780
Slightly decrease fatigue early race pace chaser.

3199
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:41,180
I didn't see at all what kind of bracer...

3200
02:44:41,880 --> 02:44:42,320
Uh...

3201
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:43,780
McQueen is, so...

3202
02:44:47,630 --> 02:44:48,890
She's a pace chaser.

3203
02:44:50,450 --> 02:44:50,890
Ah...

3204
02:44:57,330 --> 02:44:58,690
These ones are so high!

3205
02:45:00,850 --> 02:45:02,630
What does spring runner mean though?

3206
02:45:02,890 --> 02:45:04,170
It's not the season, right?

3207
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:06,650
Is that like when you first take off?

3208
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:07,830
Is that like springing...

3209
02:45:08,470 --> 02:45:09,290
Into action?

3210
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:11,590
Check from the full stats.

3211
02:45:11,810 --> 02:45:12,630
Okay, I'll check later.

3212
02:45:13,630 --> 02:45:14,970
Slightly increase acceleration.

3213
02:45:15,550 --> 02:45:15,990
Oh...

3214
02:45:15,990 --> 02:45:17,830
I wish this one was cheaper, but...

3215
02:45:19,210 --> 02:45:20,610
Oh, it is for the season!

3216
02:45:21,830 --> 02:45:22,270
Oh...

3217
02:45:22,270 --> 02:45:25,270
I swear I thought that was just like, you know...

3218
02:45:25,970 --> 02:45:26,410
Oh...

3219
02:45:26,850 --> 02:45:27,290
Okay...

3220
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:30,970
I guess...

3221
02:45:30,970 --> 02:45:32,930
Well, I can't use either of these...

3222
02:45:32,930 --> 02:45:34,270
Or do either of these, so...

3223
02:45:34,270 --> 02:45:35,850
This is really the only one I can get.

3224
02:45:37,250 --> 02:45:37,690
Okay...

3225
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:39,210
Learn!

3226
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:45,340
Alright...

3227
02:45:50,340 --> 02:45:51,340
I'm nervous!

3228
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:55,960
Green skills are cheap, but very situational.

3229
02:45:56,180 --> 02:45:58,020
I see, I see...

3230
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:00,740
Okay...

3231
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:02,200
Predictions!

3232
02:46:02,420 --> 02:46:04,040
Races are where Uma Musume shine!

3233
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:06,540
Place in the top to get the most skill points and fans.

3234
02:46:07,330 --> 02:46:09,760
The make debut is the first race to glory!

3235
02:46:11,380 --> 02:46:14,140
Attributes developed in training have a huge effect in races.

3236
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:15,680
Okay...

3237
02:46:15,680 --> 02:46:18,420
Choose races that fit your Uma Musume's aptitudes.

3238
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:21,600
There are five race grades from...

3239
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:23,140
Pre-open to G1!

3240
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:26,900
Break your way to the top...

3241
02:46:26,900 --> 02:46:28,400
Oh, we only got the one.

3242
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:29,380
What's predictions mean?

3243
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:32,760
Whoaaaah!

3244
02:46:33,660 --> 02:46:36,600
Your trainee seems pumped up and ready for a challenge!

3245
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:39,300
I could say she could be a top contender!

3246
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:40,680
Alright!

3247
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:42,560
Race!

3248
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,440
It's summer cloudy day.

3249
02:46:48,100 --> 02:46:50,660
Mejiro McQueen's momentous debut races today.

3250
02:46:51,620 --> 02:46:52,300
Huh...

3251
02:46:54,970 --> 02:46:56,050
Are you hyped for this?

3252
02:46:56,830 --> 02:46:57,390
Eh?

3253
02:46:58,230 --> 02:46:59,390
Yes, I'm fine.

3254
02:46:59,610 --> 02:47:01,570
I'm a little nervous, it's true, but...

3255
02:47:02,130 --> 02:47:07,470
It's an exhilarating feeling to know that, starting now, I'm truly moving toward my goal!

3256
02:47:09,410 --> 02:47:12,850
This is the first step on the road to conquering the Tenno Sho!

3257
02:47:13,370 --> 02:47:14,590
Now here I go!

3258
02:47:20,050 --> 02:47:21,090
The favorite?

3259
02:47:21,090 --> 02:47:23,190
The power is completely on top, right?

3260
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:25,090
I can't even feel it.

3261
02:47:26,670 --> 02:47:29,030
That's my girl, that's my girl!

3262
02:47:29,310 --> 02:47:30,710
Who's girl desuwa?

3263
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:35,230
Okay.

3264
02:47:36,750 --> 02:47:38,510
Here we go, what's... wait, who else is running?

3265
02:47:40,470 --> 02:47:42,110
Crazy in love!

3266
02:47:42,730 --> 02:47:43,210
Uh-oh.

3267
02:47:44,110 --> 02:47:44,770
Everyone else...

3268
02:47:44,770 --> 02:47:44,890
Oh!

3269
02:48:01,810 --> 02:48:03,010
Kachau desuwa?

3270
02:48:08,080 --> 02:48:08,600
Landscape.

3271
02:48:08,800 --> 02:48:12,020
I heard that people like watching it in Landscape more than Portrait.

3272
02:48:13,320 --> 02:48:14,480
And I kind of agree.

3273
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:20,300
Here we go.

3274
02:48:29,290 --> 02:48:29,810
Oh...

3275
02:48:32,010 --> 02:48:32,530
Yeah...

3276
02:48:32,530 --> 02:48:33,430
Um...

3277
02:48:33,990 --> 02:48:35,230
Sorry, everybody else!

3278
02:48:36,250 --> 02:48:38,330
I'm not gonna count my chickens before they hatch!

3279
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:42,810
Portrait has good zoom-ins and dynamic angles.

3280
02:48:42,810 --> 02:48:43,230
Ooh!

3281
02:48:43,770 --> 02:48:45,150
Maybe we'll try it next time, then.

3282
02:48:47,290 --> 02:48:48,810
The Hanshin Turf!

3283
02:48:54,530 --> 02:48:56,670
Oh, she looks nervous.

3284
02:48:58,510 --> 02:48:58,970
Hahahaha!

3285
02:48:59,430 --> 02:48:59,570
Hahahaha!

3286
02:49:01,630 --> 02:49:01,970
Hahahaha!

3287
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:04,390
These are killing me!

3288
02:49:04,650 --> 02:49:06,250
They're all like...

3289
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:06,630
Hahahaha!

3290
02:49:06,630 --> 02:49:08,630
They're all so...

3291
02:49:09,190 --> 02:49:09,930
Normal-looking.

3292
02:49:11,990 --> 02:49:12,010
Hahaha...

3293
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:12,370
Hahahaha...

3294
02:49:13,630 --> 02:49:14,270
Hahahaha...

3295
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:16,630
You're ready...

3296
02:49:18,850 --> 02:49:19,190
Start!

3297
02:49:20,250 --> 02:49:21,230
Late Star!

3298
02:49:22,370 --> 02:49:37,430
A little pause.

3299
02:49:37,430 --> 02:49:39,310
Uh-oh.

3300
02:49:39,590 --> 02:49:40,290
Oh, we're fine!

3301
02:49:42,930 --> 02:49:43,390
Queen!

3302
02:49:44,570 --> 02:49:44,970
The Queen!

3303
02:49:47,910 --> 02:49:48,830
Okay.

3304
02:49:49,330 --> 02:49:49,810
All right.

3305
02:50:01,270 --> 02:50:02,190
It's okay!

3306
02:50:02,530 --> 02:50:03,250
Don't feel rushed!

3307
02:50:03,410 --> 02:50:04,090
You're on the interface!

3308
02:50:06,350 --> 02:50:07,950
Why is she flopping?

3309
02:50:08,330 --> 02:50:09,170
Why is she...

3310
02:50:09,170 --> 02:50:10,290
Don't flopping!

3311
02:50:11,050 --> 02:50:12,310
You have this!

3312
02:50:16,590 --> 02:50:18,030
Debut nerves...

3313
02:50:46,610 --> 02:50:48,010
Ohhhh...

3314
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:49,910
Oh, it's close though!

3315
02:50:50,070 --> 02:50:50,610
It's close!

3316
02:50:51,370 --> 02:50:52,230
It's close!

3317
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:53,470
It's close!

3318
02:50:54,310 --> 02:50:54,370
Quick!

3319
02:50:57,850 --> 02:50:57,990
Quick!

3320
02:50:59,630 --> 02:51:01,250
Yeah, it's too much!

3321
02:51:08,630 --> 02:51:09,310
Haha!

3322
02:51:12,750 --> 02:51:13,330
Haha!

3323
02:51:13,330 --> 02:51:14,510
Mejiro McQueen!

3324
02:51:17,450 --> 02:51:18,610
Mejiro McQueen!

3325
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:28,710
She was just trying to make it exciting early on.

3326
02:51:29,090 --> 02:51:29,310
Yeah!

3327
02:51:30,650 --> 02:51:33,010
Horse, why are you having tea in the middle of racing?

3328
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:39,720
Look at how beautiful she is!

3329
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:49,060
I get to see my girl!

3330
02:51:49,220 --> 02:51:49,500
Oh!

3331
02:51:51,220 --> 02:51:52,340
Look at her!

3332
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:54,780
She's the center!

3333
02:51:56,360 --> 02:51:56,820
Oh!

3334
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:58,180
Oh my gosh, she's so cute!

3335
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:08,940
Who voices the NPC girls?

3336
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:17,920
The idol step, yeah!

3337
02:52:40,860 --> 02:52:42,800
Her singing voice is so cute!

3338
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:52,820
I don't know the words at all.

3339
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:59,820
I don't know the words at all.

3340
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:01,120
That's my girl!

3341
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:14,360
She's running!

3342
02:53:14,940 --> 02:53:15,580
She's running!

3343
02:53:21,070 --> 02:53:22,550
She's so pretty!

3344
02:53:27,950 --> 02:53:30,850
Is that her...tummy right there?

3345
02:53:36,100 --> 02:53:39,280
Look how your face visibly lights up with the idol fistarts.

3346
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:49,640
What a good design.

3347
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:51,080
Cut!

3348
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:00,060
Only trainers who don't believe in their umas falter at late starts.

3349
02:54:00,300 --> 02:54:01,920
You have to believe in their umas.

3350
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:03,200
I believe.

3351
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:05,200
Did you win?

3352
02:54:05,320 --> 02:54:05,700
I did!

3353
02:54:08,220 --> 02:54:09,960
My first race...

3354
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:15,560
Consider this the first page of the legend you'll write together.

3355
02:54:17,400 --> 02:54:18,420
She's a beginner.

3356
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:22,420
Oh, you can watch the concert again.

3357
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:23,120
That's so good.

3358
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:27,100
Thank you.

3359
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:35,160
Oh, oh.

3360
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:36,220
You were great!

3361
02:54:41,790 --> 02:54:48,530
This is the first step towards achieving my goal.

3362
02:54:48,690 --> 02:54:50,690
I'm glad I managed to make an impressive start.

3363
02:54:55,070 --> 02:54:56,230
Something on your mind?

3364
02:54:57,850 --> 02:54:59,810
I was just... absorbed in the moment.

3365
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:04,770
I was just thinking of how... having been successful in my debut...

3366
02:55:04,770 --> 02:55:06,630
I've gained the opportunity to strive for my goal.

3367
02:55:06,750 --> 02:55:07,510
Can you lose?

3368
02:55:07,970 --> 02:55:09,610
I mean, I imagine you can.

3369
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:14,310
But like, how... I feel like it's probably pretty difficult to lose this first race, no?

3370
02:55:16,790 --> 02:55:17,970
By what you mean?

3371
02:55:20,190 --> 02:55:21,750
Conquering the Tenno Sho!

3372
02:55:22,990 --> 02:55:27,610
The Tenno Sho is a race treasured in the memories of both my grandmother and grandfather.

3373
02:55:27,950 --> 02:55:29,830
The pillars of the Mejiro family.

3374
02:55:31,870 --> 02:55:33,550
I get second a lot.

3375
02:55:34,470 --> 02:55:35,950
No, but even your first race?

3376
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:40,450
It's not difficult to lose.

3377
02:55:40,590 --> 02:55:41,730
No, I mean the first one.

3378
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:50,320
You can lose the make debut.

3379
02:55:53,240 --> 02:55:54,760
You guys are scaring me.

3380
02:55:55,800 --> 02:55:57,340
You guys are scaring me.

3381
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:59,980
Oh my, welcome to membership.

3382
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:00,700
Thank you!

3383
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:05,660
My abilities as a stayer have been valued highly.

3384
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:07,280
Here, I'm just gonna put on audio so I can drink.

3385
02:56:12,540 --> 02:56:14,280
Tried P-Cross, last girl.

3386
02:56:16,120 --> 02:56:18,160
Let's aim for the Spring Tenno Sho!

3387
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:20,740
I'm merely at the starting point right now.

3388
02:56:21,140 --> 02:56:22,900
The Tenno Sho is still a ways in the future.

3389
02:56:23,140 --> 02:56:25,740
I have plenty of time, so I must carefully hone my abilities.

3390
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:28,980
Yeah, we'll start by gaining some experience.

3391
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:29,320
Oh!

3392
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:29,760
Oh!

3393
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:30,240
Oh!

3394
02:56:30,460 --> 02:56:30,660
Oh!

3395
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:33,780
Oh!

3396
02:56:33,780 --> 02:56:35,640
Is it a horse racing game or is it a dating set?

3397
02:56:38,060 --> 02:56:40,080
I don't think you date the horses.

3398
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:41,920
Maybe close.

3399
02:56:42,980 --> 02:56:44,140
You have a favorite horse yet?

3400
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:46,780
Right now, I am...

3401
02:56:49,360 --> 02:56:51,340
I am biased towards McQueen.

3402
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,540
But I also really like...

3403
02:56:53,540 --> 02:56:55,380
Current and Top Gun.

3404
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:57,340
I don't even know how much power is.

3405
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:00,480
I can't wait to sleep.

3406
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:02,280
I can't wait to sleep.

3407
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:02,980
Oh, we're still going!

3408
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:04,320
Oh, let's go.

3409
02:57:04,660 --> 02:57:05,440
Oh, you wanna sleep?

3410
02:57:05,780 --> 02:57:06,740
Oh, we just started.

3411
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:18,380
The queen is so cute.

3412
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:20,260
I know, she really is really cute.

3413
02:57:20,920 --> 02:57:21,820
She's so cute.

3414
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:22,300
I just...

3415
02:57:25,020 --> 02:57:27,600
I know she's tired, but I like the sound she makes.

3416
02:57:34,260 --> 02:57:36,840
There's a setting to have your girls run into gym uniforms.

3417
02:57:42,280 --> 02:57:43,800
I think that's your thing.

3418
02:57:44,300 --> 02:57:44,680
I...

3419
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:45,580
Excuse me.

3420
02:57:46,460 --> 02:57:49,640
If you don't even know how much power is, Okay, you can rest.

3421
02:57:49,960 --> 02:57:50,420
You can rest.

3422
02:57:52,320 --> 02:57:54,800
We'll get you nice and, uh...

3423
02:57:54,800 --> 02:57:56,440
We'll get you nice and...

3424
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:56,940
Hello?

3425
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:01,500
Nice and rested for...

3426
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:01,640
Oh.

3427
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:03,440
Uh-oh.

3428
02:58:07,020 --> 02:58:08,200
That knock scared me.

3429
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:09,260
I thought...

3430
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:10,540
Oh.

3431
02:58:10,880 --> 02:58:12,000
She's still tired?

3432
02:58:16,890 --> 02:58:19,110
All my homies hate Night Owl.

3433
02:58:20,410 --> 02:58:21,170
Oh, wait.

3434
02:58:22,170 --> 02:58:23,050
Comfy fit.

3435
02:58:24,670 --> 02:58:28,010
The comfier the clothes, the more energy I have to play and enjoy myself.

3436
02:58:28,310 --> 02:58:28,450
Yeah.

3437
02:58:31,470 --> 02:58:32,070
Back...

3438
02:58:32,470 --> 02:58:33,670
In the era of...

3439
02:58:33,670 --> 02:58:35,890
Amomo crossed an Ogurikap.

3440
02:58:36,010 --> 02:58:37,730
There was an American horse named Hofharden.

3441
02:58:37,770 --> 02:58:39,350
Needless to say, it was hilarious when the...

3442
02:58:39,350 --> 02:58:43,090
Announcers called his name over and over during the race.

3443
02:58:45,570 --> 02:58:46,130
Oh!

3444
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:51,060
Eureka!

3445
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:54,320
Her stamina.

3446
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:56,380
We gotta get her...

3447
02:58:56,380 --> 02:58:56,600
We gotta get her...

3448
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:58,800
We gotta get her...

3449
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:02,420
We gotta get her...

3450
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:02,700
We gotta get her...

3451
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:04,560
Okay, before we train...

3452
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:05,340
We get happy again.

3453
02:59:06,240 --> 02:59:07,360
And then we train.

3454
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:10,120
There we go.

3455
02:59:13,100 --> 02:59:13,660
Ah!

3456
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:18,580
Wait, I didn't even know she was suffering from that.

3457
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:19,560
Oh!

3458
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:20,920
The condition was...

3459
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:22,580
It's more than usual than usual...

3460
02:59:32,460 --> 02:59:33,340
Ah!

3461
02:59:34,540 --> 02:59:35,720
We'll see the menu as always...

3462
02:59:38,060 --> 02:59:39,820
As always...

3463
02:59:41,860 --> 02:59:43,700
As always...

3464
02:59:43,700 --> 02:59:53,340
As always...

3465
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:53,720
Uh!

3466
02:59:53,740 --> 02:59:53,760
Ah!

3467
02:59:53,780 --> 02:59:53,940
Ah!

3468
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:58,000
Ah... You poked her too much.

3469
02:59:58,140 --> 02:59:59,140
I was greedy!

3470
03:00:00,540 --> 03:00:02,320
I can't help it.

3471
03:00:02,440 --> 03:00:03,300
I'm a little greedy.

3472
03:00:03,560 --> 03:00:03,740
Oh, come on.

3473
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:06,040
To me,娘.

3474
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:11,240
Wait, my speed is level 2 now.

3475
03:00:15,940 --> 03:00:17,340
Treadmill, level 2.

3476
03:00:24,210 --> 03:00:26,430
Ye gold ship curse striketh.

3477
03:00:28,570 --> 03:00:29,610
Okay, I'm gonna try.

3478
03:00:29,730 --> 03:00:30,210
Wait, let's see.

3479
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:33,310
Oh, oh, she runnin'.

3480
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:39,330
She really wants to sleep again.

3481
03:00:40,290 --> 03:00:41,530
Okay, you can sleep.

3482
03:00:42,830 --> 03:00:44,170
Please actually sleep.

3483
03:00:44,430 --> 03:00:45,170
Please sleep.

3484
03:00:45,450 --> 03:00:46,010
Sleep for...

3485
03:00:47,630 --> 03:00:48,910
She slept for real!

3486
03:00:49,110 --> 03:00:50,170
Oh my gosh, she got a fan letter.

3487
03:00:50,290 --> 03:00:51,250
She's gonna be feeling so good.

3488
03:00:51,490 --> 03:00:51,930
Right?

3489
03:00:54,850 --> 03:00:55,470
Yeah, yeah.

3490
03:00:56,390 --> 03:00:58,070
Grandma, she really likes her grandma.

3491
03:00:59,770 --> 03:01:02,530
The person who wrote the letter would be happy to hear that too, I'm sure.

3492
03:01:02,810 --> 03:01:03,050
Mwah!

3493
03:01:09,400 --> 03:01:09,840
Mwah!

3494
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:11,360
Mwah!

3495
03:01:14,920 --> 03:01:15,360
Mwah!

3496
03:01:15,400 --> 03:01:16,220
Yeah, baby!

3497
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:16,880
Mwah!

3498
03:01:20,900 --> 03:01:21,340
Mwah!

3499
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:24,060
She got full energy and full...

3500
03:01:25,160 --> 03:01:26,480
We're so good.

3501
03:01:26,580 --> 03:01:27,200
We're so good.

3502
03:01:27,460 --> 03:01:28,160
Let's see.

3503
03:01:29,500 --> 03:01:30,180
Stamina...

3504
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:30,780
Power?

3505
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:33,800
Maybe...

3506
03:01:33,800 --> 03:01:36,080
Power, since we have three friends here.

3507
03:01:41,960 --> 03:01:42,820
I need fans?

3508
03:01:43,100 --> 03:01:44,380
Wait, how do I get fans?

3509
03:01:51,250 --> 03:01:51,610
How do I get fans?

3510
03:01:51,610 --> 03:01:51,770
Something...

3511
03:01:51,770 --> 03:01:52,310
Lots happening.

3512
03:01:53,190 --> 03:01:53,530
What is?

3513
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:54,090
The race?

3514
03:01:55,590 --> 03:01:55,930
Ah...

3515
03:01:55,930 --> 03:01:56,830
I see, I see, I see.

3516
03:01:57,650 --> 03:01:57,990
Ah...

3517
03:01:57,990 --> 03:01:58,350
Okay, okay.

3518
03:02:01,290 --> 03:02:01,630
Um...

3519
03:02:04,530 --> 03:02:07,170
This is focusing on fans, so we'll try this one.

3520
03:02:10,410 --> 03:02:10,890
Oh...

3521
03:02:10,890 --> 03:02:11,610
Okay, okay, okay.

3522
03:02:12,130 --> 03:02:14,510
Oh, I thought that we could only do it...

3523
03:02:14,510 --> 03:02:15,610
The race is...

3524
03:02:15,610 --> 03:02:16,050
Here.

3525
03:02:16,890 --> 03:02:17,950
Oh, it's just...

3526
03:02:17,950 --> 03:02:18,370
Wait.

3527
03:02:19,310 --> 03:02:21,130
Ah, they're all just a little...

3528
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:25,810
I think this one might be the best.

3529
03:02:26,450 --> 03:02:26,750
Okay.

3530
03:02:28,650 --> 03:02:29,790
Check the other days.

3531
03:02:30,810 --> 03:02:31,290
Oh...

3532
03:02:36,480 --> 03:02:38,080
Plus 3000 fans!

3533
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:41,920
Um...

3534
03:02:42,760 --> 03:02:44,700
If you win, you get more fans than listed.

3535
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:45,400
Oh, really?

3536
03:02:46,980 --> 03:02:48,940
You want two stars on each.

3537
03:02:50,500 --> 03:02:53,180
If I win, that might be enough though, right?

3538
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:54,120
Let's try it.

3539
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:57,640
Do not take if not two stars.

3540
03:02:57,860 --> 03:02:58,220
Okay, okay.

3541
03:02:59,080 --> 03:03:00,040
Okay, okay, okay.

3542
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:01,440
Then...

3543
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:02,520
Let me try it.

3544
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:03,580
Let me just see...

3545
03:03:03,970 --> 03:03:05,040
What happens, you know?

3546
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:08,920
I can't win.

3547
03:03:14,420 --> 03:03:15,280
That's my girl.

3548
03:03:24,390 --> 03:03:25,310
I'm scared.

3549
03:03:26,030 --> 03:03:26,770
I can't win.

3550
03:03:26,770 --> 03:03:26,910
I can't win.

3551
03:03:29,790 --> 03:03:30,370
No.

3552
03:03:33,150 --> 03:03:33,730
Oh...

3553
03:03:44,050 --> 03:03:44,830
Uh-oh.

3554
03:03:45,590 --> 03:03:47,030
We have a main girl in here.

3555
03:03:47,150 --> 03:03:47,630
I'm scared.

3556
03:03:50,230 --> 03:03:51,930
We have a bright shower in here.

3557
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:57,220
Uh-oh.

3558
03:03:58,180 --> 03:03:58,760
Uh-oh.

3559
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:01,040
I'm scared.

3560
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:03,560
I'm scared.

3561
03:04:17,560 --> 03:04:19,060
I'm scared.

3562
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:20,040
Uh...

3563
03:04:20,040 --> 03:04:20,860
Pressure...

3564
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:23,840
Pressure...

3565
03:04:24,520 --> 03:04:25,480
I'm scared...

3566
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:31,020
It's okay.

3567
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:33,980
Believe in the U.M.A.

3568
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:43,700
Don't root for Bryce Allen!

3569
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,420
Root for Bryce Allen!

3570
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:47,480
Stop!

3571
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:51,540
Stop!

3572
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:56,620
I'm gonna ban you!

3573
03:04:56,980 --> 03:04:58,440
We don't root for McQueen!

3574
03:04:59,280 --> 03:04:59,760
Oh!

3575
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:01,400
Nice, nice, nice!

3576
03:05:16,360 --> 03:05:17,800
Oh, we're fine.

3577
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:20,360
We're not.

3578
03:05:22,100 --> 03:05:23,000
It's okay.

3579
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:26,000
We're still in the middle.

3580
03:05:32,040 --> 03:05:32,960
McQueen!

3581
03:05:34,180 --> 03:05:34,720
Yeah!

3582
03:05:38,020 --> 03:05:38,940
Acceleration.

3583
03:05:39,860 --> 03:05:40,080
Oh!

3584
03:05:41,740 --> 03:05:42,660
Yes!

3585
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:46,760
Good duty activity!

3586
03:05:47,900 --> 03:05:48,360
Yeah!

3587
03:05:50,960 --> 03:05:52,800
Go, go, go, go, go!

3588
03:05:57,060 --> 03:05:58,060
Chiyu-chan!

3589
03:05:58,560 --> 03:05:59,480
Chiyu-chan!

3590
03:06:03,980 --> 03:06:05,100
She's so cool!

3591
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:05,500
Yeah!

3592
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:06,720
Too much!

3593
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:10,940
Too much!

3594
03:06:11,360 --> 03:06:11,600
It's not a good day!

3595
03:06:19,870 --> 03:06:20,810
It's not a good day!

3596
03:06:22,050 --> 03:06:23,690
It's not a good day!

3597
03:06:25,310 --> 03:06:27,030
Believe in your U.M.A.

3598
03:06:27,030 --> 03:06:27,070
Yeah!

3599
03:06:27,550 --> 03:06:28,610
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3600
03:06:29,230 --> 03:06:29,470
Go!

3601
03:06:33,460 --> 03:06:34,700
Woo-hoo-hoo-hee!

3602
03:06:36,940 --> 03:06:38,020
Oh my goodness!

3603
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:39,700
Town hangout!

3604
03:06:40,120 --> 03:06:41,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3605
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:43,500
Rice shower...

3606
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,520
Oh god, Aether!

3607
03:06:44,520 --> 03:06:44,820
Let's go!

3608
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:45,780
Let's go!

3609
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:48,790
Electroflab!

3610
03:06:50,140 --> 03:06:51,280
Frozen sky!

3611
03:06:52,420 --> 03:06:53,360
Roomba step!

3612
03:06:56,260 --> 03:06:59,200
Does Minky know the IRL rice shower lore?

3613
03:07:00,440 --> 03:07:00,790
Uh...

3614
03:07:01,140 --> 03:07:01,820
Yes!

3615
03:07:02,210 --> 03:07:04,760
She was the one that like, people didn't like, right?

3616
03:07:18,880 --> 03:07:20,700
Yeah, the villain who stole wins!

3617
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:21,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3618
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:22,620
That's what I heard!

3619
03:07:23,440 --> 03:07:23,580
Yeah!

3620
03:07:25,980 --> 03:07:30,570
And like, people didn't like her because...

3621
03:07:31,590 --> 03:07:32,710
Or the...

3622
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:33,810
Because...

3623
03:07:33,810 --> 03:07:35,370
There was like, other...

3624
03:07:35,370 --> 03:07:38,130
Horses that people were betting on, and then...

3625
03:07:38,130 --> 03:07:39,570
She stole from...

3626
03:07:41,110 --> 03:07:41,950
From the...

3627
03:07:41,950 --> 03:07:42,350
The win.

3628
03:07:44,290 --> 03:07:46,430
Which I'm like, that's just how the...

3629
03:07:46,430 --> 03:07:47,710
The game is played!

3630
03:07:48,630 --> 03:07:50,310
Hate the game, don't hate the player!

3631
03:07:51,250 --> 03:07:53,730
I believe in Mito, therefore I believe in McQueen!

3632
03:07:54,450 --> 03:07:55,010
Soken!

3633
03:07:57,370 --> 03:07:58,330
Your tattoo!

3634
03:07:58,330 --> 03:07:58,510
Who?

3635
03:07:59,880 --> 03:08:01,010
I saw it!

3636
03:08:09,010 --> 03:08:10,320
I saw it!

3637
03:08:10,600 --> 03:08:11,940
Your Minto tattoo!

3638
03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:17,120
Eat the arm!

3639
03:08:18,800 --> 03:08:20,000
You saw?

3640
03:08:20,220 --> 03:08:20,360
Yeah!

3641
03:08:21,140 --> 03:08:22,080
I saw!

3642
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:23,840
It's crazy!

3643
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:25,580
You're crazy!

3644
03:08:27,830 --> 03:08:29,020
But thank you!

3645
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:33,040
We got enough!

3646
03:08:33,220 --> 03:08:33,620
Let's go!

3647
03:08:37,010 --> 03:08:38,370
We have more!

3648
03:08:39,610 --> 03:08:40,710
Thank goodness!

3649
03:08:42,110 --> 03:08:43,530
Please forget you heard that...

3650
03:08:43,530 --> 03:08:44,310
She's so cute!

3651
03:08:46,350 --> 03:08:49,290
I'm a member of the Mejiro family after all!

3652
03:08:50,350 --> 03:08:51,310
It's for you!

3653
03:08:55,890 --> 03:08:56,410
I...

3654
03:08:56,410 --> 03:08:57,170
I...

3655
03:08:57,170 --> 03:08:57,710
I...

3656
03:08:58,330 --> 03:08:58,850
I'm...

3657
03:08:58,850 --> 03:09:00,310
Embarrassed though...

3658
03:09:01,830 --> 03:09:03,350
I'm embarrassed though...

3659
03:09:07,360 --> 03:09:09,880
I can't let the fact that I got first place...

3660
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:11,780
Look how cute she is!

3661
03:09:16,710 --> 03:09:17,630
You did it!

3662
03:09:17,730 --> 03:09:18,550
You really did it!

3663
03:09:18,550 --> 03:09:18,890
Yes!

3664
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:22,190
Aren't you a little too happy?

3665
03:09:28,610 --> 03:09:32,390
You get so excited over every little thing, you'll wear yourself out!

3666
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:32,930
No!

3667
03:09:33,430 --> 03:09:34,250
You're my Uma!

3668
03:09:35,090 --> 03:09:36,790
You're my horns!

3669
03:09:38,550 --> 03:09:42,050
There's still a number of victories and fighting that will be a worthy celebration...

3670
03:09:42,050 --> 03:09:42,690
Worthy of cel...

3671
03:09:42,690 --> 03:09:42,870
Oh!

3672
03:09:43,130 --> 03:09:44,170
Energy went down...

3673
03:09:44,170 --> 03:09:44,710
Stamina up!

3674
03:09:45,270 --> 03:09:46,090
Skill points up!

3675
03:09:46,730 --> 03:09:47,410
Hint up!

3676
03:09:50,840 --> 03:09:51,740
A movie theater...

3677
03:09:52,420 --> 03:09:52,900
I skip!

3678
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,280
Hint up!

3679
03:09:58,400 --> 03:09:58,840
Well, 2003...lander...

3680
03:09:58,840 --> 03:09:59,240
From the last...

3681
03:09:59,240 --> 03:10:00,300
Where we made a lot of songs for fun!

3682
03:10:01,280 --> 03:10:04,580
We reached our goal of 3000 fans!

3683
03:10:04,940 --> 03:10:05,380
Let's gold!

3684
03:10:06,660 --> 03:10:09,340
Then we... Can train!

3685
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:11,840
We're feeling good!

3686
03:10:15,550 --> 03:10:21,370
Let's do... More...

3687
03:10:21,370 --> 03:10:23,210
Speed...

3688
03:10:26,890 --> 03:10:28,050
That was really fast.

3689
03:10:32,490 --> 03:10:34,490
Let's see, training...

3690
03:10:34,490 --> 03:10:37,690
Wait... 4%... 2%...

3691
03:10:39,590 --> 03:10:41,130
These are kinda high, though.

3692
03:10:48,220 --> 03:10:49,340
What does that mean?

3693
03:10:54,400 --> 03:10:56,480
Let's do... Stamina.

3694
03:10:59,020 --> 03:10:59,580
Success!

3695
03:11:02,120 --> 03:11:02,900
More Stamina!

3696
03:11:03,480 --> 03:11:05,280
More extra training... Uh-oh.

3697
03:11:06,360 --> 03:11:07,100
Are you gonna be tired?

3698
03:11:12,300 --> 03:11:14,760
My aim is to always maintain a magnificent lead.

3699
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:16,160
I cannot afford to fall behind.

3700
03:11:18,640 --> 03:11:20,280
What is she gonna get too tired?

3701
03:11:24,900 --> 03:11:27,820
Akshin can be one with all... Just all speed...

3702
03:11:27,820 --> 03:11:28,800
Oh, okay.

3703
03:11:35,560 --> 03:11:36,960
Choice two, restore stamina?

3704
03:11:37,220 --> 03:11:38,460
Oh, we probably should do that then, huh?

3705
03:11:41,720 --> 03:11:43,300
Oh, she still wants to sleep anyway.

3706
03:11:44,180 --> 03:11:45,620
Yeah, I'll let you sleep.

3707
03:11:47,160 --> 03:11:48,860
I'll let you sleep a little.

3708
03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:52,800
Aw...

3709
03:11:53,640 --> 03:11:54,380
Aw...

3710
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:56,340
Aw...

3711
03:11:58,320 --> 03:11:59,060
Aw...

3712
03:11:59,060 --> 03:11:59,500
Aw...

3713
03:11:59,500 --> 03:12:00,220
Aw...

3714
03:12:01,460 --> 03:12:03,200
We're feeling good, baby.

3715
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:06,880
Let's see...

3716
03:12:08,380 --> 03:12:10,180
Aw... I think we should do wit.

3717
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:12,140
All of our friends are in class.

3718
03:12:24,740 --> 03:12:25,620
Nice.

3719
03:12:26,020 --> 03:12:26,900
Nice.

3720
03:12:27,420 --> 03:12:28,040
Nice.

3721
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:31,980
Ryan.

3722
03:12:33,020 --> 03:12:34,040
Young Ryan.

3723
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:37,400
Wait, show me the babies.

3724
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:39,620
Show me young McQueen.

3725
03:12:40,220 --> 03:12:41,180
Sh... Sh...

3726
03:12:41,180 --> 03:12:42,500
Show me young McQueen!

3727
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:43,460
Why?

3728
03:12:43,780 --> 03:12:45,340
Why am I getting...

3729
03:12:46,040 --> 03:12:49,060
Why am I being denied this?

3730
03:12:58,860 --> 03:12:59,260
Oh...

3731
03:13:01,140 --> 03:13:01,720
Uh-oh.

3732
03:13:04,420 --> 03:13:05,500
Is she getting...

3733
03:13:06,300 --> 03:13:07,360
Oh, that's Ryan!

3734
03:13:07,620 --> 03:13:08,420
Oh, that's right!

3735
03:13:09,040 --> 03:13:09,840
That's Ryan!

3736
03:13:09,980 --> 03:13:10,340
I forgot.

3737
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:15,400
Wait.

3738
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:15,940
Okay.

3739
03:13:16,800 --> 03:13:18,480
We skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

3740
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:20,160
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

3741
03:13:20,300 --> 03:13:21,140
Sorry, there's so much.

3742
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:23,440
Okay.

3743
03:13:25,660 --> 03:13:26,220
Okay.

3744
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:26,860
Okay.

3745
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:27,820
Let's do some more training.

3746
03:13:34,580 --> 03:13:35,740
Everybody's in wit again.

3747
03:13:39,710 --> 03:13:41,290
I think we do wit again.

3748
03:13:48,970 --> 03:13:50,410
I think we'll do wit again.

3749
03:13:55,750 --> 03:13:56,310
Okay.

3750
03:13:57,270 --> 03:13:57,830
Okay.

3751
03:13:57,830 --> 03:13:59,290
We're skipping.

3752
03:13:59,570 --> 03:13:59,890
We're skipping.

3753
03:14:00,690 --> 03:14:01,410
We're skipping.

3754
03:14:01,910 --> 03:14:02,990
Something delicious.

3755
03:14:03,630 --> 03:14:03,870
Oh.

3756
03:14:05,370 --> 03:14:06,090
Nice.

3757
03:14:06,930 --> 03:14:07,370
What?

3758
03:14:08,090 --> 03:14:09,670
We can get something fancy.

3759
03:14:10,030 --> 03:14:10,730
If I...

3760
03:14:10,730 --> 03:14:10,890
Wait.

3761
03:14:11,390 --> 03:14:12,030
With both.

3762
03:14:13,650 --> 03:14:14,170
Uh-oh.

3763
03:14:14,290 --> 03:14:15,230
What should I choose?

3764
03:14:16,230 --> 03:14:16,950
Stamina?

3765
03:14:17,710 --> 03:14:18,730
Or wit?

3766
03:14:19,350 --> 03:14:20,430
Wit is important?

3767
03:14:20,630 --> 03:14:21,010
Yeah, yeah.

3768
03:14:21,070 --> 03:14:22,290
For skills and stuff too.

3769
03:14:24,670 --> 03:14:25,390
Stamina.

3770
03:14:27,830 --> 03:14:27,950
Hmm.

3771
03:14:29,570 --> 03:14:31,010
Wit so you can get skills for...

3772
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:32,230
Race day.

3773
03:14:32,530 --> 03:14:33,270
I can't...

3774
03:14:33,270 --> 03:14:33,710
I don't know.

3775
03:14:33,890 --> 03:14:36,370
Half of you guys are saying wit and half of you guys are saying stamina.

3776
03:14:38,230 --> 03:14:38,830
Oh, yeah.

3777
03:14:38,970 --> 03:14:40,010
Wit doesn't cost energy.

3778
03:14:40,190 --> 03:14:40,350
Right.

3779
03:14:51,420 --> 03:14:54,180
My stamina is pretty high, but...

3780
03:14:59,280 --> 03:15:00,420
Wit regens energy.

3781
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:01,100
Oh, really?

3782
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:01,240
Really?

3783
03:15:02,900 --> 03:15:04,420
My speed is low.

3784
03:15:04,720 --> 03:15:05,580
I think we'll be okay.

3785
03:15:05,980 --> 03:15:07,000
If not...

3786
03:15:08,460 --> 03:15:10,060
We'll just go...

3787
03:15:10,060 --> 03:15:11,350
We'll just...

3788
03:15:11,840 --> 03:15:12,900
Use more skill.

3789
03:15:17,430 --> 03:15:18,750
I think I'll go with wit.

3790
03:15:25,030 --> 03:15:25,870
Ramp up.

3791
03:15:26,130 --> 03:15:27,610
Oh, that sounds good.

3792
03:15:27,610 --> 03:15:27,790
Good.

3793
03:15:30,530 --> 03:15:31,090
Um...

3794
03:15:31,090 --> 03:15:31,270
Yeah.

3795
03:15:33,370 --> 03:15:34,650
We have enough energy.

3796
03:15:34,810 --> 03:15:35,310
So it's okay.

3797
03:15:36,650 --> 03:15:36,990
Yes.

3798
03:15:38,350 --> 03:15:38,750
Okay.

3799
03:15:46,230 --> 03:15:47,570
Ramp up is a good skill.

3800
03:15:47,810 --> 03:15:48,050
Yeah.

3801
03:15:49,290 --> 03:15:49,670
Alright.

3802
03:15:49,850 --> 03:15:52,030
Place top three in Kobe Shinbun Hai.

3803
03:15:52,030 --> 03:15:52,110
Bye.

3804
03:15:54,330 --> 03:15:54,970
Okay.

3805
03:15:57,530 --> 03:15:58,170
Okay.

3806
03:15:58,490 --> 03:15:59,270
Thank you so much.

3807
03:15:59,690 --> 03:16:00,690
Happy New Year.

3808
03:16:01,450 --> 03:16:02,530
Happy New Year.

3809
03:16:03,170 --> 03:16:03,350
Happy New Year.

3810
03:16:03,350 --> 03:16:03,970
Trust in wit.

3811
03:16:04,290 --> 03:16:05,970
Said the guy with wit in his name.

3812
03:16:09,690 --> 03:16:10,270
Here we go.

3813
03:16:14,300 --> 03:16:14,620
Since...

3814
03:16:15,440 --> 03:16:16,640
That has been decided.

3815
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:17,840
I should begin to train...

3816
03:16:18,200 --> 03:16:19,940
Begin training post haste.

3817
03:16:21,880 --> 03:16:23,320
What do the different ones do?

3818
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:26,620
Let's build a solid foundation for your endurance.

3819
03:16:26,820 --> 03:16:27,740
Let's go have lunch.

3820
03:16:28,180 --> 03:16:29,740
Let's do some track research.

3821
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:35,360
Stats, energy, skill points.

3822
03:16:36,420 --> 03:16:36,940
Ah...

3823
03:16:36,940 --> 03:16:39,500
I think skill points is probably good then, right?

3824
03:16:43,040 --> 03:16:44,380
Oh, a 20!

3825
03:16:44,740 --> 03:16:45,580
Holy moly!

3826
03:16:50,960 --> 03:16:52,000
Wait, so...

3827
03:16:53,020 --> 03:16:54,500
Did we not do the big race?

3828
03:16:58,520 --> 03:16:58,920
Okay.

3829
03:16:58,920 --> 03:16:58,960
I'm ready.

3830
03:17:00,820 --> 03:17:01,220
I'm ready.

3831
03:17:01,220 --> 03:17:01,360
Now...

3832
03:17:01,360 --> 03:17:01,900
Can I ask you?

3833
03:17:05,740 --> 03:17:07,480
Oh, the goal was the fan count.

3834
03:17:08,220 --> 03:17:08,620
Ah...

3835
03:17:08,620 --> 03:17:09,740
I see, I see, I see.

3836
03:17:09,860 --> 03:17:10,720
Okay, okay, okay.

3837
03:17:10,820 --> 03:17:11,340
The goal...

3838
03:17:11,340 --> 03:17:14,340
I understand now.

3839
03:17:14,520 --> 03:17:15,400
I understand...

3840
03:17:15,400 --> 03:17:16,280
How it's working.

3841
03:17:17,360 --> 03:17:18,660
Okay, I get how it's working.

3842
03:17:19,300 --> 03:17:19,700
Okay.

3843
03:17:22,060 --> 03:17:23,200
Check races, yeah.

3844
03:17:25,200 --> 03:17:28,200
But we don't want anything that's not...

3845
03:17:29,920 --> 03:17:31,660
Like, wait, this one would be good.

3846
03:17:36,360 --> 03:17:38,560
Nothing that's not both stars, right?

3847
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:40,780
This one is awesome.

3848
03:17:43,820 --> 03:17:46,620
You can see the full career and the details up top.

3849
03:17:49,740 --> 03:17:50,340
Ah...

3850
03:17:52,580 --> 03:17:54,020
So, like, if I...

3851
03:17:54,400 --> 03:17:56,700
qualify top three in this, does that...

3852
03:17:58,100 --> 03:18:00,220
Well, it's not Kobe Shinbun Hai.

3853
03:18:00,560 --> 03:18:01,300
Is that...

3854
03:18:01,300 --> 03:18:03,480
What happens at 17 turns?

3855
03:18:03,880 --> 03:18:05,540
Sorry, I'm asking so many questions.

3856
03:18:06,640 --> 03:18:08,420
Sorry, I'm asking so many questions.

3857
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:12,840
Predictions.

3858
03:18:14,520 --> 03:18:15,120
Mmm...

3859
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:16,660
I think we need to get our speed up.

3860
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:17,220
Huh?

3861
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:20,260
Okay, so...

3862
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:21,700
Then we can focus on training.

3863
03:18:22,460 --> 03:18:23,740
More so than...

3864
03:18:23,740 --> 03:18:24,640
Racing.

3865
03:18:26,700 --> 03:18:27,020
Now...

3866
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:27,560
It's very good.

3867
03:18:29,060 --> 03:18:30,100
That's right.

3868
03:18:31,400 --> 03:18:33,420
Winning races gives skill points and fan base.

3869
03:18:33,780 --> 03:18:34,300
Okay.

3870
03:18:35,080 --> 03:18:36,120
I think I'm gonna...

3871
03:18:36,120 --> 03:18:37,300
Let me train this a little bit.

3872
03:18:38,240 --> 03:18:39,960
Cause I do wanna get my speed up.

3873
03:18:41,620 --> 03:18:42,920
Since it was a little...

3874
03:18:42,920 --> 03:18:43,480
Just one...

3875
03:18:43,480 --> 03:18:44,120
One Maru.

3876
03:18:44,520 --> 03:18:45,740
We want Maru Maru.

3877
03:18:45,780 --> 03:18:46,360
Double Maru.

3878
03:18:50,100 --> 03:18:51,000
Look at her go!

3879
03:18:53,140 --> 03:18:53,860
Uh...

3880
03:18:53,860 --> 03:18:56,160
The flag advertising a special fare.

3881
03:18:56,680 --> 03:18:57,920
Chestnut feast!

3882
03:18:59,020 --> 03:18:59,740
Yummy...

3883
03:19:02,900 --> 03:19:05,080
You should stuff yourself silly!

3884
03:19:09,200 --> 03:19:11,080
Wait, what does green mean again?

3885
03:19:11,380 --> 03:19:12,100
Sorry...

3886
03:19:12,100 --> 03:19:12,820
Uh...

3887
03:19:12,820 --> 03:19:14,040
Yellow is energy, right?

3888
03:19:14,040 --> 03:19:14,400
Alright...

3889
03:19:15,700 --> 03:19:16,740
Skill points!

3890
03:19:23,870 --> 03:19:25,490
Wait, the color doesn't mean anything?

3891
03:19:25,750 --> 03:19:26,590
I thought it does!

3892
03:19:27,170 --> 03:19:28,890
Top is energy...

3893
03:19:29,510 --> 03:19:30,110
Bottom...

3894
03:19:31,390 --> 03:19:31,990
Is...

3895
03:19:32,650 --> 03:19:32,950
There?

3896
03:19:33,130 --> 03:19:33,270
What?

3897
03:19:33,910 --> 03:19:35,770
Oh, I thought the colors did matter.

3898
03:19:35,770 --> 03:19:36,230
Just kidding.

3899
03:19:38,050 --> 03:19:38,650
Oh...

3900
03:19:38,650 --> 03:19:39,890
Just follow your heart.

3901
03:19:39,890 --> 03:19:41,370
I want her to stuff herself silly.

3902
03:19:43,890 --> 03:19:45,810
Look how happy she was!

3903
03:19:48,790 --> 03:19:53,670
Mejiro McQueen's potential seems to grow in proportion to the number of calories she consumes.

3904
03:20:00,450 --> 03:20:01,030
Yeah!

3905
03:20:01,930 --> 03:20:02,510
Okay.

3906
03:20:03,370 --> 03:20:03,810
Uh-oh.

3907
03:20:05,330 --> 03:20:06,590
Do I want guts?

3908
03:20:12,330 --> 03:20:13,590
We love that for her.

3909
03:20:13,670 --> 03:20:14,230
Yeah, we do.

3910
03:20:16,970 --> 03:20:19,450
The observation is usually in context with the scene.

3911
03:20:19,630 --> 03:20:20,170
Okay, okay.

3912
03:20:21,190 --> 03:20:21,810
Good to know.

3913
03:20:22,010 --> 03:20:22,370
Speed!

3914
03:20:22,750 --> 03:20:23,230
More speed!

3915
03:20:23,370 --> 03:20:25,270
I need to train my power too, no?

3916
03:20:25,950 --> 03:20:28,070
But we have three friends in speed, so...

3917
03:20:31,070 --> 03:20:31,870
She going?

3918
03:20:32,030 --> 03:20:32,450
She speeding?

3919
03:20:33,010 --> 03:20:33,570
She...

3920
03:20:34,050 --> 03:20:34,890
Training level up?

3921
03:20:35,370 --> 03:20:36,950
A tea party!

3922
03:20:37,350 --> 03:20:38,150
Oh, elegance.

3923
03:20:38,590 --> 03:20:39,470
Oh, fancy.

3924
03:20:40,170 --> 03:20:42,230
Oh my gosh, her outfit is so cute!

3925
03:20:46,390 --> 03:20:48,910
I said you could wear your normal clothes.

3926
03:20:49,050 --> 03:20:51,150
Don't you have trouble breathing in that restrictive suit?

3927
03:20:53,130 --> 03:20:56,230
I mean, this is a tea party with the renowned imagine of family!

3928
03:20:59,730 --> 03:21:04,050
I'm a queen overrace so much once I had to send her to the infermary.

3929
03:21:07,900 --> 03:21:08,240
Just...

3930
03:21:08,660 --> 03:21:09,000
Just...

3931
03:21:09,640 --> 03:21:09,980
Just...

3932
03:21:09,980 --> 03:21:11,860
Rub her tummy and make her do jumping jacks.

3933
03:21:11,940 --> 03:21:12,240
I don't know.

3934
03:21:12,240 --> 03:21:12,320
No!

3935
03:21:19,210 --> 03:21:20,890
It's not a joke, it can happen!

3936
03:21:21,290 --> 03:21:22,930
Okay, I'll be careful about...

3937
03:21:22,930 --> 03:21:24,690
Overfeeding my horse.

3938
03:21:27,410 --> 03:21:29,210
You're usually silent, trainer.

3939
03:21:29,450 --> 03:21:30,290
It's something the matter.

3940
03:21:30,630 --> 03:21:32,830
I was just thinking about how cool you are!

3941
03:21:33,190 --> 03:21:36,170
I was just thinking that I'd better up my game to...

3942
03:21:36,170 --> 03:21:38,650
Be fit to stand by your side!

3943
03:21:38,650 --> 03:21:39,510
Aw!

3944
03:21:43,250 --> 03:21:43,870
Oh!

3945
03:21:45,710 --> 03:21:46,470
Okay.

3946
03:21:48,670 --> 03:21:49,650
Let's see.

3947
03:21:52,470 --> 03:21:53,370
We'll keep training.

3948
03:21:54,750 --> 03:21:56,170
Exercise bike!

3949
03:21:57,830 --> 03:21:59,330
I think...

3950
03:22:00,550 --> 03:22:01,830
Maybe stamina.

3951
03:22:02,370 --> 03:22:04,370
I do wanna get my other stuff up more.

3952
03:22:06,230 --> 03:22:08,390
Like, I wanna get my power up more.

3953
03:22:10,390 --> 03:22:10,970
Mmm...

3954
03:22:10,970 --> 03:22:12,910
Can't digest food without guts!

3955
03:22:20,730 --> 03:22:21,850
Well, we'll do stamina.

3956
03:22:23,010 --> 03:22:23,350
Let's go!

3957
03:22:25,570 --> 03:22:26,910
I'm happy, I'm happy!

3958
03:22:28,190 --> 03:22:29,350
I'm happy, I'm happy!

3959
03:22:29,350 --> 03:22:29,830
I'm happy!

3960
03:22:32,450 --> 03:22:33,030
Okay.

3961
03:22:33,730 --> 03:22:34,310
Nice!

3962
03:22:34,590 --> 03:22:35,530
Okay, that leveled up too.

3963
03:22:36,170 --> 03:22:36,790
Cool, cool, cool.

3964
03:22:36,970 --> 03:22:37,710
Worthy of...

3965
03:22:37,710 --> 03:22:39,490
Just an acupuncturist.

3966
03:22:40,090 --> 03:22:40,450
Hi, hi!

3967
03:22:41,390 --> 03:22:41,970
Oh!

3968
03:22:48,920 --> 03:22:49,400
Oh!

3969
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:52,600
I've never been into acupuncture before!

3970
03:22:56,040 --> 03:22:57,440
Hold on, I wanna...

3971
03:22:57,440 --> 03:22:57,600
Okay.

3972
03:22:58,420 --> 03:22:58,920
A customer!

3973
03:22:59,060 --> 03:23:00,020
I mean, a student!

3974
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:00,500
Hello!

3975
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:01,780
Are you hurt?

3976
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:02,480
Sick?

3977
03:23:02,980 --> 03:23:03,460
Stressed?

3978
03:23:03,640 --> 03:23:05,200
Whatever it is, I treat it all!

3979
03:23:05,780 --> 03:23:06,380
Who are you?

3980
03:23:06,380 --> 03:23:12,860
Well, considering you're at the Academy Affirmary, I'd say that makes me your trusty school nurse.

3981
03:23:13,300 --> 03:23:15,700
Yep, just your average school employee.

3982
03:23:16,880 --> 03:23:18,140
No you aren't.

3983
03:23:18,780 --> 03:23:19,380
Ahahaha!

3984
03:23:19,900 --> 03:23:21,160
Guess there's no fooling you.

3985
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:23,500
I suppose I should start by giving you my name.

3986
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:24,300
Ahem!

3987
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:26,420
Allow me to introduce myself.

3988
03:23:26,720 --> 03:23:33,800
I am the likely savior of all, Uma Musume, the self-proclaimed legendary acupuncturist with the magic touch!

3989
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:36,660
The one and only Sasami Anshin Zawa!

3990
03:23:36,660 --> 03:23:37,540
See?

3991
03:23:37,860 --> 03:23:38,620
No worries.

3992
03:23:39,860 --> 03:23:42,220
They certainly do not inspire any confidence.

3993
03:23:42,800 --> 03:23:43,340
Gosh!

3994
03:23:43,560 --> 03:23:44,520
You seem worried!

3995
03:23:48,780 --> 03:23:49,400
Oh wait!

3996
03:23:49,460 --> 03:23:50,480
Her voice is so much cuter!

3997
03:23:51,160 --> 03:23:51,660
No matter!

3998
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:52,220
No matter!

3999
03:23:52,420 --> 03:23:56,700
We've made our introduction, so lie down and let me put these needles to work!

4000
03:23:59,660 --> 03:24:01,260
Where is this conversation headed?

4001
03:24:04,660 --> 03:24:06,040
No need to be scared!

4002
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:11,920
All I'm going to do is slip these extraordinary needles precisely into your chakra points!

4003
03:24:14,060 --> 03:24:15,140
Then voila!

4004
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:16,100
Presto!

4005
03:24:16,440 --> 03:24:18,620
Something indescribable will happen!

4006
03:24:20,040 --> 03:24:22,520
This is indescribably sketchy!

4007
03:24:25,480 --> 03:24:29,780
And let me assure you, there's absolutely nothing sketchy about this at all!

4008
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:32,600
It's never gone anything less than perfectly!

4009
03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:36,380
She either boosts you or screws you over!

4010
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:36,860
I'm scared!

4011
03:24:37,740 --> 03:24:38,540
For my master!

4012
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:43,460
Yeah, you guys!

4013
03:24:43,740 --> 03:24:45,680
Do you want a maid acupuncturist?

4014
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:47,800
For my master?

4015
03:24:49,540 --> 03:24:50,880
What about for you?

4016
03:24:51,640 --> 03:24:52,480
Don't fret!

4017
03:24:52,640 --> 03:24:55,960
This is my first time, so technically I've never failed a patient either!

4018
03:24:58,280 --> 03:24:59,360
Stab me, Minky!

4019
03:25:03,030 --> 03:25:05,110
And it's not like I have no experience!

4020
03:25:05,110 --> 03:25:08,070
I've spent 10 years under a legendary master!

4021
03:25:08,410 --> 03:25:10,570
Fetching dr- I mean...

4022
03:25:10,570 --> 03:25:10,950
Training!

4023
03:25:12,690 --> 03:25:13,210
Well...

4024
03:25:13,210 --> 03:25:13,830
Anxin!

4025
03:25:14,470 --> 03:25:14,990
Anxin!

4026
03:25:15,690 --> 03:25:16,410
See you!

4027
03:25:16,550 --> 03:25:17,250
No worries!

4028
03:25:18,690 --> 03:25:20,210
We need to get out of here stat!

4029
03:25:21,470 --> 03:25:22,770
There's no way we're doing this!

4030
03:25:22,770 --> 03:25:24,750
First I take Mejito McQueen and head for the door when...

4031
03:25:24,750 --> 03:25:25,050
Yeah?

4032
03:25:26,530 --> 03:25:27,170
Wha...

4033
03:25:27,170 --> 03:25:28,270
Where are you going?

4034
03:25:28,790 --> 03:25:28,990
No!

4035
03:25:30,190 --> 03:25:31,730
You're Mejito McQueen, right?

4036
03:25:32,010 --> 03:25:34,310
The Umumusume striving to achieve the...

4037
03:25:34,310 --> 03:25:38,010
Dearest wishes of sublime and noble Mejito family!

4038
03:25:38,450 --> 03:25:39,910
But needles are scary!

4039
03:25:40,930 --> 03:25:42,150
You got...

4040
03:25:42,150 --> 03:25:44,070
You had 6 hours of tattoos!

4041
03:25:44,270 --> 03:25:45,370
I don't wanna hear it from you!

4042
03:25:45,370 --> 03:25:45,510
No!

4043
03:25:49,330 --> 03:25:50,250
You've heard of her?

4044
03:25:51,410 --> 03:25:52,570
Have I heard of her?

4045
03:25:52,690 --> 03:25:53,850
Of course I have!

4046
03:25:54,110 --> 03:25:55,210
I'm a big fan!

4047
03:26:00,490 --> 03:26:02,210
That's precisely why I'm here!

4048
03:26:02,310 --> 03:26:03,470
Oh no, she's a stalker!

4049
03:26:03,810 --> 03:26:05,110
To give you my support!

4050
03:26:05,730 --> 03:26:06,870
Let me help you!

4051
03:26:09,350 --> 03:26:11,070
Just give me a chance, please!

4052
03:26:13,430 --> 03:26:16,990
A cliché often spotted by persons of dubious backgrounds.

4053
03:26:16,990 --> 03:26:20,870
It's not as though I've learned nothing from enduring gold ship's antics, you know?

4054
03:26:20,970 --> 03:26:21,450
One day!

4055
03:26:22,350 --> 03:26:23,810
These are the carrot on top!

4056
03:26:24,030 --> 03:26:25,810
So I know what I'm talking about!

4057
03:26:28,110 --> 03:26:30,750
I'll even let you choose which chakra I activate!

4058
03:26:32,750 --> 03:26:34,830
I'm sure I won't mess up!

4059
03:26:36,230 --> 03:26:36,790
Well...

4060
03:26:36,790 --> 03:26:37,710
Pretty sure!

4061
03:26:39,250 --> 03:26:40,170
Pretty sure!

4062
03:26:41,570 --> 03:26:43,450
I mean, it's on the sure side!

4063
03:26:43,670 --> 03:26:44,850
That's good, right?

4064
03:26:45,750 --> 03:26:46,310
Anyway...

4065
03:26:46,310 --> 03:26:47,870
Don't get hung up on the details!

4066
03:26:48,550 --> 03:26:51,570
You can turn me into Sonic the Hedgehog any day!

4067
03:26:53,730 --> 03:26:54,290
Good!

4068
03:26:55,470 --> 03:26:56,830
Let's get to the good stuff!

4069
03:26:57,090 --> 03:26:58,490
Which chakra should I activate?

4070
03:26:58,910 --> 03:27:00,310
Do you want to boost your abilities?

4071
03:27:00,550 --> 03:27:01,250
Your health?

4072
03:27:01,390 --> 03:27:02,810
Or maybe your charm?

4073
03:27:03,870 --> 03:27:04,410
Or...

4074
03:27:04,410 --> 03:27:06,150
I smell danger in the air...

4075
03:27:06,150 --> 03:27:07,370
But I figure there might...

4076
03:27:07,370 --> 03:27:08,550
And I emphasize might...

4077
03:27:08,550 --> 03:27:10,690
Be a chance of getting something special out of this treatment!

4078
03:27:12,110 --> 03:27:13,370
Her hair is wild!

4079
03:27:13,810 --> 03:27:14,750
What shall we do?

4080
03:27:35,890 --> 03:27:37,650
Top is the big gamble?

4081
03:27:38,550 --> 03:27:39,090
Really?

4082
03:27:40,830 --> 03:27:42,670
Top is the big gamble?

4083
03:27:42,670 --> 03:27:42,810
Cool!

4084
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:50,380
All in?

4085
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:05,540
It's Blackjack!

4086
03:28:08,020 --> 03:28:09,120
It's Blackjack!

4087
03:28:09,280 --> 03:28:10,700
And I just flipped two cards!

4088
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:12,340
Ten...

4089
03:28:12,820 --> 03:28:14,060
Seven...

4090
03:28:14,060 --> 03:28:15,140
What do I do?

4091
03:28:15,560 --> 03:28:16,380
Double down?

4092
03:28:17,900 --> 03:28:19,300
Do I draw again?

4093
03:28:19,300 --> 03:28:19,760
Ten...

4094
03:28:24,030 --> 03:28:25,320
I'm in...

4095
03:28:26,910 --> 03:28:27,340
Hit!

4096
03:28:27,700 --> 03:28:28,220
Hit!

4097
03:28:28,940 --> 03:28:29,520
Hit!

4098
03:28:32,400 --> 03:28:34,240
Strength chakra, let's go!

4099
03:28:37,060 --> 03:28:39,480
It's giving me the option to back out!

4100
03:29:11,610 --> 03:29:12,470
Sayonara!

4101
03:29:17,410 --> 03:29:17,790
Ha!

4102
03:29:32,160 --> 03:29:34,620
Like we're into a mimic chest!

4103
03:29:34,980 --> 03:29:35,860
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4104
03:29:41,690 --> 03:29:42,450
Aaaaaah!

4105
03:29:42,750 --> 03:29:44,630
To the inferno, here we go!

4106
03:29:45,230 --> 03:29:46,750
We can make it up!

4107
03:29:47,510 --> 03:29:48,650
Don't worry!

4108
03:29:57,600 --> 03:29:58,760
She's cured!

4109
03:30:06,210 --> 03:30:08,490
Why don't you go for a run?

4110
03:30:09,490 --> 03:30:10,290
Wah!

4111
03:30:11,430 --> 03:30:12,230
Doobie!

4112
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:15,750
Hi Doobie!

4113
03:30:16,230 --> 03:30:16,770
Hi!

4114
03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:21,880
Thank you for the raid!

4115
03:30:22,260 --> 03:30:23,240
Thank you so much!

4116
03:30:24,340 --> 03:30:26,340
I hope you had a great stream!

4117
03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:30,160
I just lost everything!

4118
03:30:37,210 --> 03:30:38,950
We lost it all!

4119
03:30:42,950 --> 03:30:46,490
We're having Megidou McQueen eat something sweet before she's...

4120
03:30:46,490 --> 03:30:48,390
Before she's turned to glue!

4121
03:30:48,830 --> 03:30:49,890
Ha ha ha ha!

4122
03:30:55,080 --> 03:30:56,960
I think we can make it back up!

4123
03:30:58,820 --> 03:31:00,380
Thank you for all the gifts you guys!

4124
03:31:00,540 --> 03:31:00,900
Thank you!

4125
03:31:01,380 --> 03:31:02,720
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much!

4126
03:31:02,820 --> 03:31:03,540
Thank you, thank you!

4127
03:31:07,360 --> 03:31:08,460
You got this!

4128
03:31:08,600 --> 03:31:08,720
Yeah!

4129
03:31:08,780 --> 03:31:09,320
We got this!

4130
03:31:09,320 --> 03:31:09,500
Let's do this.

4131
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:12,080
We'll have her... We'll have her go for a run.

4132
03:31:14,780 --> 03:31:17,340
We already recouped that strength.

4133
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:18,360
Or the speed.

4134
03:31:20,280 --> 03:31:21,100
Oh, good.

4135
03:31:21,480 --> 03:31:21,920
Probably.

4136
03:31:22,440 --> 03:31:23,160
More guts.

4137
03:31:24,720 --> 03:31:25,500
Okay, let's see.

4138
03:31:25,800 --> 03:31:26,220
Oh, no!

4139
03:31:26,780 --> 03:31:28,060
I didn't mean to do that.

4140
03:31:28,240 --> 03:31:30,420
I accidentally double-clicked, but that's okay.

4141
03:31:34,180 --> 03:31:34,960
Director's office.

4142
03:31:35,140 --> 03:31:37,460
Sorry I'm skipping everything because there's so much...

4143
03:31:37,460 --> 03:31:39,460
There's a lot of text and...

4144
03:31:41,900 --> 03:31:43,500
Wait, I forgot about our mood.

4145
03:31:43,680 --> 03:31:44,900
I should've gone out.

4146
03:31:45,020 --> 03:31:45,460
Have fun.

4147
03:31:47,620 --> 03:31:48,680
Oh, it went back down.

4148
03:31:52,100 --> 03:31:53,680
Mucho texto, exactly.

4149
03:31:57,240 --> 03:31:57,720
Karaoke!

4150
03:31:58,020 --> 03:31:58,180
Oh!

4151
03:31:58,480 --> 03:31:59,220
And it went up...

4152
03:31:59,220 --> 03:31:59,960
All the way!

4153
03:32:00,520 --> 03:32:01,200
Let's go.

4154
03:32:01,660 --> 03:32:02,580
Wait, please don't go down.

4155
03:32:03,980 --> 03:32:04,420
Oh.

4156
03:32:05,000 --> 03:32:05,380
Oh.

4157
03:32:06,380 --> 03:32:08,160
Play the claw machine to get cuties!

4158
03:32:09,620 --> 03:32:10,520
Try to get...

4159
03:32:10,520 --> 03:32:11,380
Oh, my musume plushies.

4160
03:32:11,380 --> 03:32:12,240
Also known as cuties.

4161
03:32:12,280 --> 03:32:14,300
You will be successful if you get one within three attempts.

4162
03:32:14,640 --> 03:32:16,920
Succeeding may result in your training unlocking new hints!

4163
03:32:17,980 --> 03:32:19,560
Wait, I'm really bad at this.

4164
03:32:19,720 --> 03:32:20,940
I want the top gun!

4165
03:32:20,940 --> 03:32:22,140
You are going to dance.

4166
03:32:24,780 --> 03:32:25,220
I just can't wait, but...

4167
03:32:25,220 --> 03:32:25,500
Watch it!

4168
03:32:25,500 --> 03:32:26,020
Wait, who's that?

4169
03:32:26,240 --> 03:32:32,700
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da a da-da-da Try to aim for the center.

4170
03:32:41,900 --> 03:32:42,940
You hold.

4171
03:32:43,240 --> 03:32:44,180
Okay, hold it, hold it.

4172
03:32:44,560 --> 03:32:45,620
Hold, don't tap.

4173
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:46,000
Okay.

4174
03:32:48,460 --> 03:32:53,080
Okay, I'm gonna scoot it over in case I accidentally go past her and underestimate the speed.

4175
03:32:53,340 --> 03:32:56,160
And then... Oh, never mind.

4176
03:33:06,040 --> 03:33:06,560
Oh!

4177
03:33:08,100 --> 03:33:10,480
Well, obviously, we have to get the Mejiro.

4178
03:33:12,660 --> 03:33:13,380
Flash.

4179
03:33:14,900 --> 03:33:16,600
Go for the vertical ones.

4180
03:33:18,080 --> 03:33:19,460
It's so fast.

4181
03:33:21,060 --> 03:33:21,780
Wait.

4182
03:33:24,980 --> 03:33:27,900
Oh my gosh, it came with an El Condor Plaza.

4183
03:33:35,380 --> 03:33:37,480
Yeah, this one's huge.

4184
03:33:38,360 --> 03:33:39,900
Should we go for the biggie?

4185
03:33:40,780 --> 03:33:42,440
3, 2, 1, fight!

4186
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:51,580
Okay, let's try for the big head.

4187
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:54,180
It's so fast.

4188
03:33:54,180 --> 03:33:56,740
Oh my gosh, the speed is so fast.

4189
03:34:01,230 --> 03:34:15,770
Oh my gosh, so giant cutie.

4190
03:34:16,430 --> 03:34:18,870
Oh my gosh,

4191
03:34:23,620 --> 03:34:25,500
so giant cutie.

4192
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:27,380
Yeah, mine is so cute.

4193
03:34:27,380 --> 03:34:27,420
Yeah, mine is so cute.

4194
03:34:29,080 --> 03:34:30,720
Use them to decorate my room.

4195
03:34:32,160 --> 03:34:32,600
Yeah.

4196
03:34:33,260 --> 03:34:34,340
Don't they take up a lot of space?

4197
03:34:34,660 --> 03:34:35,720
No, these are tiny.

4198
03:34:36,560 --> 03:34:37,220
Let's see.

4199
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:38,020
Big win!

4200
03:34:40,420 --> 03:34:41,060
Let's go.

4201
03:34:41,220 --> 03:34:42,720
I told you we would recover, everybody.

4202
03:34:44,480 --> 03:34:45,820
I told you we'd recover.

4203
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:47,720
Inspiration.

4204
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:49,620
What's happening?

4205
03:34:51,340 --> 03:34:52,460
What's happening?

4206
03:35:00,010 --> 03:35:01,250
What's happening?

4207
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:08,200
Yeah, me too!

4208
03:35:08,380 --> 03:35:08,860
What's happening?

4209
03:35:13,310 --> 03:35:14,830
We've been inspired.

4210
03:35:27,530 --> 03:35:28,850
Saved from the factory.

4211
03:35:30,550 --> 03:35:31,370
Hell yeah.

4212
03:35:33,510 --> 03:35:36,670
I don't ever know what's going on in this game, but...

4213
03:35:38,950 --> 03:35:41,110
I really want to get more power.

4214
03:35:43,330 --> 03:35:44,810
I think I'm gonna go for power.

4215
03:35:44,810 --> 03:35:50,350
Just because I... I should increase it.

4216
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:56,060
Sippy reminder.

4217
03:35:57,980 --> 03:35:59,040
I'm out of water.

4218
03:36:04,490 --> 03:36:06,190
I need to get more water after this.

4219
03:36:06,610 --> 03:36:10,010
Well, I had a little bit left in my cup, but...

4220
03:36:10,590 --> 03:36:12,770
Probably get more power by training speed.

4221
03:36:13,110 --> 03:36:13,750
You think so?

4222
03:36:14,070 --> 03:36:16,170
Oh, I guess you're right, actually.

4223
03:36:16,710 --> 03:36:18,010
Yeah, we get plus seven.

4224
03:36:18,150 --> 03:36:19,210
It's just a little bit more, huh?

4225
03:36:25,540 --> 03:36:26,740
Okay, we'll do speed.

4226
03:36:33,040 --> 03:36:34,540
She's so fast.

4227
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:36,360
So funny.

4228
03:36:37,740 --> 03:36:38,900
Fast and furious.

4229
03:36:41,200 --> 03:36:42,680
Okay, keep trying then.

4230
03:36:42,800 --> 03:36:43,860
Wait, let's check races.

4231
03:36:44,520 --> 03:36:46,760
Because you get stats from races too, no?

4232
03:36:47,800 --> 03:36:50,380
This might be good to do.

4233
03:36:52,240 --> 03:36:53,280
Classic year.

4234
03:36:59,440 --> 03:37:01,180
Oh, just skill points.

4235
03:37:02,540 --> 03:37:03,920
Skill points mostly.

4236
03:37:04,240 --> 03:37:04,660
Okay, okay.

4237
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:06,500
But this should still be good, no?

4238
03:37:07,280 --> 03:37:08,480
We have ten days.

4239
03:37:09,620 --> 03:37:10,640
Let's try it.

4240
03:37:10,640 --> 03:37:12,200
Oh wait, let's check the predictions.

4241
03:37:15,600 --> 03:37:16,880
Top contender.

4242
03:37:20,880 --> 03:37:22,360
Maybe try a J1.

4243
03:37:30,350 --> 03:37:33,830
Can't compete with 5,000 fans or more, but I...

4244
03:37:34,430 --> 03:37:37,030
Can't even... It's not even double star anyway.

4245
03:37:40,310 --> 03:37:40,770
We'll...

4246
03:37:40,770 --> 03:37:41,750
Check tomorrow.

4247
03:37:43,330 --> 03:37:44,650
J1 gives a lot of skill points.

4248
03:37:45,430 --> 03:37:48,670
But this makes me feel even more that I need to increase my power.

4249
03:37:48,830 --> 03:37:49,930
Because it was...

4250
03:37:49,930 --> 03:37:50,670
So low.

4251
03:37:52,610 --> 03:37:54,150
I guess we just keep doing speed.

4252
03:37:54,750 --> 03:37:56,330
We'll get more power that way.

4253
03:37:58,590 --> 03:37:59,070
Uh...

4254
03:38:04,280 --> 03:38:05,600
Might need more fans.

4255
03:38:05,720 --> 03:38:06,440
Yeah, I did say...

4256
03:38:06,440 --> 03:38:07,820
I said that I needed...

4257
03:38:08,360 --> 03:38:09,580
5,000 fans.

4258
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:11,840
So then maybe...

4259
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:12,820
We just do this.

4260
03:38:13,100 --> 03:38:13,820
After all.

4261
03:38:14,060 --> 03:38:15,240
Oh wait, but my...

4262
03:38:16,040 --> 03:38:17,020
What about this one?

4263
03:38:18,740 --> 03:38:19,220
Ah!

4264
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:20,280
This one's better.

4265
03:38:22,380 --> 03:38:23,380
This one's better.

4266
03:38:34,700 --> 03:38:35,860
I think we should do it.

4267
03:38:36,760 --> 03:38:38,040
I think we should try it.

4268
03:38:39,020 --> 03:38:39,860
I think so.

4269
03:38:41,620 --> 03:38:42,840
We're gonna try.

4270
03:38:43,220 --> 03:38:44,180
We're gonna try.

4271
03:38:44,500 --> 03:38:45,540
We're gonna try.

4272
03:38:45,760 --> 03:38:46,440
Okay.

4273
03:38:50,020 --> 03:38:51,120
I'm scared.

4274
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:54,380
I'm scared.

4275
03:38:56,580 --> 03:38:57,620
I'm scared.

4276
03:38:59,930 --> 03:39:00,320
Ah!

4277
03:39:00,800 --> 03:39:02,400
I'm going against the Top Gun!

4278
03:39:05,960 --> 03:39:06,740
Brian!

4279
03:39:08,820 --> 03:39:11,960
I like how some of these PNGs are like...

4280
03:39:11,960 --> 03:39:13,100
It's so low res.

4281
03:39:13,560 --> 03:39:14,060
Like...

4282
03:39:14,060 --> 03:39:15,620
They really were like...

4283
03:39:15,620 --> 03:39:16,360
Ribbonrond...

4284
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:16,960
These...

4285
03:39:16,960 --> 03:39:19,440
These girls couldn't even bother to smile.

4286
03:39:21,740 --> 03:39:22,600
Brian!

4287
03:39:24,540 --> 03:39:26,080
That guy...

4288
03:39:26,830 --> 03:39:27,740
That guy died.

4289
03:39:31,140 --> 03:39:32,000
G2!

4290
03:39:33,500 --> 03:39:35,220
It's based on their mood?

4291
03:39:35,220 --> 03:39:36,300
Oh, that's so sad!

4292
03:39:46,140 --> 03:39:46,660
I got a P!

4293
03:39:47,640 --> 03:39:48,680
Look how cute she is!

4294
03:39:48,960 --> 03:39:49,680
Ooh, she's so cute!

4295
03:39:50,920 --> 03:39:52,400
Oh, I didn't even notice Teo!

4296
03:39:52,400 --> 03:39:53,900
You're oh!

4297
03:40:01,740 --> 03:40:02,340
What?

4298
03:40:02,600 --> 03:40:02,740
That's great!

4299
03:40:03,820 --> 03:40:07,380
He's not saying Ninky.

4300
03:40:07,520 --> 03:40:08,460
He's saying Ninky.

4301
03:40:08,460 --> 03:40:11,320
So don't get your Japanese wrong.

4302
03:40:14,760 --> 03:40:19,080
Look at the music.

4303
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:35,980
Oh, corner depth!

4304
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:38,580
Ah!

4305
03:40:42,700 --> 03:40:44,400
Oh, she's following behind!

4306
03:40:46,100 --> 03:40:47,100
Oh, she's following behind!

4307
03:40:50,880 --> 03:40:51,480
Okay.

4308
03:40:54,780 --> 03:40:56,100
You got this, but Queen!

4309
03:40:58,020 --> 03:40:59,380
It's the first one.

4310
03:41:12,020 --> 03:41:12,400
What?

4311
03:41:26,740 --> 03:41:27,560
What did I just hear?

4312
03:41:27,560 --> 03:41:30,040
I heard someone do a skill.

4313
03:41:30,540 --> 03:41:38,860
I heard someone do a skill.

4314
03:41:42,270 --> 03:41:42,270
Yeah!

4315
03:41:43,270 --> 03:41:43,850
Tea time!

4316
03:41:44,670 --> 03:41:45,650
Tea time!

4317
03:41:46,590 --> 03:41:46,890
Go!

4318
03:41:49,050 --> 03:41:49,210
Go!

4319
03:41:49,610 --> 03:41:49,950
Oh my god.

4320
03:41:50,530 --> 03:41:51,330
Tea time!

4321
03:42:00,170 --> 03:42:01,590
I'm吉sky on it, don't say that!

4322
03:42:01,710 --> 03:42:02,650
Don't jinx me please!

4323
03:42:03,370 --> 03:42:04,390
Oh my god.

4324
03:42:04,750 --> 03:42:04,830
No!

4325
03:42:05,090 --> 03:42:05,090
No!

4326
03:42:05,370 --> 03:42:05,370
No!

4327
03:42:05,850 --> 03:42:06,410
No!

4328
03:42:06,550 --> 03:42:06,550
No!

4329
03:42:06,910 --> 03:42:06,910
No!

4330
03:42:06,930 --> 03:42:06,930
No!

4331
03:42:06,990 --> 03:42:06,990
No!

4332
03:42:07,390 --> 03:42:07,390
No!

4333
03:42:07,450 --> 03:42:07,450
No!

4334
03:42:07,650 --> 03:42:07,650
No!

4335
03:42:07,650 --> 03:42:07,650
No!

4336
03:42:14,760 --> 03:42:15,320
Yeah!

4337
03:42:15,320 --> 03:42:16,320
She has it!

4338
03:42:18,380 --> 03:42:19,500
Meijiro McQueen...

4339
03:42:19,500 --> 03:42:20,400
Meijiro McQueen...

4340
03:42:20,960 --> 03:42:23,400
Meijiro McQueen...

4341
03:42:27,580 --> 03:42:30,340
Oh my gosh, Arjun, thank you so much for the 15 gifts!

4342
03:42:30,580 --> 03:42:31,120
Thank you!

4343
03:42:33,360 --> 03:42:36,280
It's the same thing, right?

4344
03:42:39,220 --> 03:42:43,500
I got a trophy, even!

4345
03:42:45,360 --> 03:42:47,080
Oh my gosh, yeah!

4346
03:42:47,940 --> 03:42:48,460
Brian!

4347
03:42:49,300 --> 03:42:51,760
Who said Brian was not to be messed with?

4348
03:42:51,760 --> 03:42:54,380
Her child, no glue for McQueen!

4349
03:42:56,920 --> 03:42:57,880
Thank you!

4350
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:05,100
We've leveled up!

4351
03:43:05,460 --> 03:43:06,480
We've leveled up!

4352
03:43:11,800 --> 03:43:13,700
You did it, you really did it!

4353
03:43:16,860 --> 03:43:17,380
Oh...

4354
03:43:20,480 --> 03:43:22,140
Rip ears was worth it, sorry.

4355
03:43:22,360 --> 03:43:23,300
Did I yell that loud?

4356
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:23,740
Sorry.

4357
03:43:24,940 --> 03:43:26,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

4358
03:43:27,100 --> 03:43:28,240
Oh, power.

4359
03:43:28,400 --> 03:43:29,660
Let's do this one.

4360
03:43:29,780 --> 03:43:30,340
Failure zero.

4361
03:43:30,620 --> 03:43:30,780
We're good.

4362
03:43:34,260 --> 03:43:35,900
Straight away, recover.

4363
03:43:37,780 --> 03:43:38,300
Oh...

4364
03:43:40,720 --> 03:43:41,960
Wait, they're so cute.

4365
03:43:42,920 --> 03:43:43,780
Look at them!

4366
03:43:43,880 --> 03:43:44,720
They're looking at me!

4367
03:43:48,380 --> 03:43:49,360
They're looking at me!

4368
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:49,780
They're looking at me!

4369
03:43:50,000 --> 03:43:51,320
It's okay, I said it was worth.

4370
03:43:53,800 --> 03:43:54,520
Thank you.

4371
03:43:56,200 --> 03:43:56,840
No me!

4372
03:43:57,020 --> 03:43:57,600
No me!

4373
03:43:57,860 --> 03:43:58,320
No me!

4374
03:43:58,500 --> 03:43:58,660
Me!

4375
03:43:58,780 --> 03:43:58,900
Me!

4376
03:43:59,060 --> 03:43:59,160
Me!

4377
03:43:59,400 --> 03:43:59,400
Me!

4378
03:43:59,400 --> 03:44:00,600
They're looking at me right now!

4379
03:44:02,020 --> 03:44:02,800
They're looking at me!

4380
03:44:04,440 --> 03:44:05,520
Now I'm looking at you.

4381
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:07,840
Wait, hold on.

4382
03:44:07,840 --> 03:44:09,580
What if we all looked at you?

4383
03:45:00,390 --> 03:45:00,830
Okay.

4384
03:45:02,290 --> 03:45:03,170
Looking time...

4385
03:45:03,170 --> 03:45:03,270
Done.

4386
03:45:10,780 --> 03:45:11,180
Oh, wait.

4387
03:45:11,340 --> 03:45:11,920
Let's just skip.

4388
03:45:12,040 --> 03:45:12,340
Sorry.

4389
03:45:16,360 --> 03:45:17,180
Oh, there we go.

4390
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:17,540
There we go.

4391
03:45:20,740 --> 03:45:22,040
Yeah, you sleep now.

4392
03:45:22,160 --> 03:45:22,700
You sleep now.

4393
03:45:24,160 --> 03:45:24,720
Looking bad.

4394
03:45:24,980 --> 03:45:25,620
I don't see any glue.

4395
03:45:26,240 --> 03:45:27,640
Why are you looking for the glue?

4396
03:45:28,460 --> 03:45:29,700
Don't look for the glue!

4397
03:45:29,700 --> 03:45:29,880
Ooh!

4398
03:45:33,460 --> 03:45:34,380
Let's see.

4399
03:45:34,760 --> 03:45:36,820
Two months from July through August.

4400
03:45:38,840 --> 03:45:39,600
Summer camp.

4401
03:45:39,800 --> 03:45:42,600
I need to pay attention to Mejiro McQueen's condition and energy leading up to it.

4402
03:45:42,740 --> 03:45:44,700
Starts two turns from now in early July.

4403
03:45:45,660 --> 03:45:46,920
Ah, summer camp.

4404
03:45:47,140 --> 03:45:47,820
What is summer camp?

4405
03:45:51,360 --> 03:45:52,600
This is summer camp, dude.

4406
03:46:02,370 --> 03:46:03,770
Extra training points.

4407
03:46:04,030 --> 03:46:05,010
Ah, I see.

4408
03:46:05,170 --> 03:46:06,170
Rest on the next turn.

4409
03:46:06,170 --> 03:46:07,170
Okay, so we'll...

4410
03:46:07,170 --> 03:46:08,910
Do this and then rest.

4411
03:46:11,770 --> 03:46:13,090
We'll do stamina.

4412
03:46:13,090 --> 03:46:14,370
There's so many friends here.

4413
03:46:17,410 --> 03:46:19,070
Best to rest before it.

4414
03:46:19,270 --> 03:46:19,310
Okay.

4415
03:46:22,710 --> 03:46:24,330
Whiff of a delicious scent.

4416
03:46:25,190 --> 03:46:27,090
A female is afoot.

4417
03:46:27,930 --> 03:46:29,210
There she is!

4418
03:46:33,790 --> 03:46:34,530
Okay.

4419
03:46:36,170 --> 03:46:36,690
So...

4420
03:46:36,690 --> 03:46:37,370
So...

4421
03:46:40,610 --> 03:46:41,130
But...

4422
03:46:44,600 --> 03:46:46,180
I'm gonna grab some more water.

4423
03:46:46,680 --> 03:46:47,700
Give me one second.

4424
03:46:48,640 --> 03:46:49,620
Oh, goodie, no cap!

4425
03:46:50,780 --> 03:46:52,420
I guess I'll rest.

4426
03:46:53,040 --> 03:46:54,120
I will rest.

4427
03:46:54,320 --> 03:46:54,980
Okay, give me a second.

4428
03:46:55,320 --> 03:46:56,240
Give me one second.

4429
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:01,720
Let me put it out.

4430
03:47:01,720 --> 03:47:02,920
But since I gotta go pot.

4431
03:47:03,200 --> 03:47:03,980
I'm going fishing.

4432
03:47:05,940 --> 03:47:07,420
I'm going fishing right now.

4433
03:47:07,860 --> 03:47:09,220
I'm going fishing right now.

4434
03:47:09,480 --> 03:47:10,900
Actually, here I'll rush.

4435
03:47:11,200 --> 03:47:12,140
Hold on.

4436
03:47:13,380 --> 03:47:14,300
I'll turn...

4437
03:47:14,840 --> 03:47:16,200
Skip... I'll turn to auto on.

4438
03:47:16,360 --> 03:47:16,820
Okay, BRB.

4439
03:47:22,820 --> 03:47:23,380
Yes.

4440
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:23,400
Oh!

4441
03:49:23,800 --> 03:49:25,080
We visited the summer camp.

4442
03:49:25,740 --> 03:49:26,580
Welcome back.

4443
03:49:26,780 --> 03:49:27,820
Thank you, I'm back.

4444
03:49:28,720 --> 03:49:29,700
We visited the summer camp.

4445
03:49:30,460 --> 03:49:31,300
Good morning.

4446
03:49:32,400 --> 03:49:32,820
Oh.

4447
03:49:33,780 --> 03:49:35,440
She did the incense again.

4448
03:49:35,720 --> 03:49:36,060
Oh.

4449
03:49:37,500 --> 03:49:38,760
Wait, she's going to the ocean.

4450
03:49:38,940 --> 03:49:39,920
Beach episode for real?

4451
03:49:41,580 --> 03:49:43,120
You seem enthusiastic.

4452
03:49:43,760 --> 03:49:44,460
I am.

4453
03:49:45,960 --> 03:49:47,380
Let's begin training.

4454
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:49,420
Summer camp training.

4455
03:49:50,040 --> 03:49:50,560
Oh!

4456
03:49:56,540 --> 03:49:57,300
Welcome back.

4457
03:49:57,460 --> 03:49:57,900
Thank you!

4458
03:50:06,120 --> 03:50:06,640
Sukumizu...

4459
03:50:06,640 --> 03:50:06,840
Wait.

4460
03:50:07,080 --> 03:50:10,940
This is actually very close to the Sukumizu I would wear at school.

4461
03:50:11,720 --> 03:50:13,460
The shorts were a little...

4462
03:50:14,160 --> 03:50:16,300
...longer, but actually Sukumizu...

4463
03:50:16,300 --> 03:50:18,720
...and like high schools and stuff in Japan...

4464
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:21,140
...are kind of like a two-piece like this...

4465
03:50:21,140 --> 03:50:21,880
...where it's like...

4466
03:50:21,880 --> 03:50:23,500
...the top and then...

4467
03:50:23,500 --> 03:50:25,100
...the bottom are like...

4468
03:50:26,660 --> 03:50:28,280
...the bottom are like shorts.

4469
03:50:33,020 --> 03:50:34,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4470
03:50:34,320 --> 03:50:35,660
This is actually very similar...

4471
03:50:35,660 --> 03:50:36,400
...to like a...

4472
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:38,800
...high school...

4473
03:50:38,800 --> 03:50:40,740
Well, that's why Sukumizu, you know?

4474
03:50:42,380 --> 03:50:42,840
Hi!

4475
03:50:46,950 --> 03:50:47,630
Let's see.

4476
03:50:48,390 --> 03:50:48,910
22!

4477
03:50:51,030 --> 03:50:52,070
Wowie powie!

4478
03:50:52,590 --> 03:50:54,190
Wait, I have no friends here.

4479
03:50:54,670 --> 03:50:55,590
Oh, yes I do.

4480
03:50:55,650 --> 03:50:55,970
Just kidding.

4481
03:50:57,510 --> 03:50:57,870
Ow!

4482
03:50:58,110 --> 03:50:59,510
But I have a lot of friends and power.

4483
03:51:02,990 --> 03:51:04,290
Meet the horse girl confirmed.

4484
03:51:05,690 --> 03:51:06,250
Yeah, yeah.

4485
03:51:06,430 --> 03:51:08,030
It is kind of like a biker shorts, yeah.

4486
03:51:13,500 --> 03:51:14,100
Let's see.

4487
03:51:14,280 --> 03:51:15,580
Do you think power or speed?

4488
03:51:16,720 --> 03:51:17,880
Really, you need more speed?

4489
03:51:18,880 --> 03:51:19,240
Okay!

4490
03:51:19,240 --> 03:51:19,360
Yay!

4491
03:51:22,040 --> 03:51:23,020
I need speed.

4492
03:51:23,880 --> 03:51:24,880
There she goes.

4493
03:51:30,500 --> 03:51:32,280
No friends, I felt the same too.

4494
03:51:34,120 --> 03:51:34,920
Okay, speed.

4495
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:36,280
You need speed so badly?

4496
03:51:36,460 --> 03:51:36,620
Really?

4497
03:51:36,760 --> 03:51:37,300
That badly?

4498
03:51:37,860 --> 03:51:39,120
Okay, we'll keep going.

4499
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:40,700
Let's go!

4500
03:51:41,000 --> 03:51:42,820
Let's go!

4501
03:51:46,580 --> 03:51:48,180
All in on speed!

4502
03:51:49,940 --> 03:51:50,840
Okay!

4503
03:51:51,480 --> 03:51:52,320
Wait, what's the...

4504
03:51:52,320 --> 03:51:52,580
Oh!

4505
03:51:53,340 --> 03:51:54,040
It's glowing!

4506
03:51:57,400 --> 03:51:58,140
Oh!

4507
03:51:59,260 --> 03:51:59,780
Oh!

4508
03:52:00,660 --> 03:52:01,280
Rainbow!

4509
03:52:02,720 --> 03:52:04,100
Okay, rainbow speed.

4510
03:52:15,850 --> 03:52:20,070
We're in the middle of summer camp and Mejiro McQueen and I are training on the beach.

4511
03:52:21,870 --> 03:52:23,130
Take a break to rehydrate!

4512
03:52:23,230 --> 03:52:23,730
Yeah, everybody!

4513
03:52:24,670 --> 03:52:25,190
Hydrate.

4514
03:52:25,930 --> 03:52:26,970
Take your...

4515
03:52:27,510 --> 03:52:28,530
Together, together.

4516
03:52:28,790 --> 03:52:29,990
Take our cups, okay?

4517
03:52:30,310 --> 03:52:31,550
And hold it to the screen.

4518
03:52:32,290 --> 03:52:32,810
Ready?

4519
03:52:32,810 --> 03:52:33,890
Hold it to your...

4520
03:52:33,890 --> 03:52:34,510
Take your cup.

4521
03:52:34,870 --> 03:52:35,910
Hold it to the screen.

4522
03:52:36,730 --> 03:52:37,550
Wait, come on.

4523
03:52:39,450 --> 03:52:40,990
Let me see if I can do this.

4524
03:52:42,490 --> 03:52:43,330
Let me see.

4525
03:52:47,830 --> 03:52:48,390
Uh...

4526
03:52:49,290 --> 03:52:49,850
Uh...

4527
03:52:49,850 --> 03:52:51,030
Hold on.

4528
03:52:51,290 --> 03:52:52,110
One moment, please.

4529
03:52:53,710 --> 03:52:54,270
Ah!

4530
03:53:01,180 --> 03:53:01,740
Ready?

4531
03:53:03,160 --> 03:53:04,280
The biggest...

4532
03:53:04,280 --> 03:53:05,780
The biggest boba...

4533
03:53:06,320 --> 03:53:07,000
You've ever seen?

4534
03:53:09,420 --> 03:53:10,060
Ready?

4535
03:53:10,440 --> 03:53:10,920
Ready?

4536
03:53:11,200 --> 03:53:11,620
Okay.

4537
03:53:11,840 --> 03:53:12,140
Ready?

4538
03:53:29,080 --> 03:53:30,180
You got water?

4539
03:53:30,320 --> 03:53:30,500
Good.

4540
03:53:31,400 --> 03:53:33,240
I'll do one more for everybody who wasn't ready before.

4541
03:53:33,820 --> 03:53:34,440
Kanpai!

4542
03:53:36,420 --> 03:53:37,060
Boop!

4543
03:53:42,700 --> 03:53:43,340
Mizuoshi!

4544
03:53:49,530 --> 03:53:51,790
It's regular size, they're just tiny.

4545
03:53:52,010 --> 03:53:52,490
Shut up!

4546
03:53:52,750 --> 03:53:54,010
That's not the case at all.

4547
03:53:56,230 --> 03:53:57,590
You know it.

4548
03:54:01,470 --> 03:54:03,770
Normal boba, you're mint size.

4549
03:54:04,370 --> 03:54:04,990
Shut up!

4550
03:54:06,010 --> 03:54:06,850
Okay.

4551
03:54:07,470 --> 03:54:08,270
We hydrated.

4552
03:54:09,190 --> 03:54:10,030
Oh!

4553
03:54:10,410 --> 03:54:11,650
Someone's getting smacked.

4554
03:54:13,150 --> 03:54:15,170
Don't serve it too fast.

4555
03:54:15,650 --> 03:54:17,190
Oh, your serve is too fast.

4556
03:54:18,190 --> 03:54:19,690
Oh, it's dober.

4557
03:54:21,630 --> 03:54:24,470
Oh my gosh, I was watching these girls on TikTok earlier.

4558
03:54:24,770 --> 03:54:28,610
They were like, these cute, cute girls and they were dancing and then...

4559
03:54:28,610 --> 03:54:32,310
The girl would serve like this crazy fast.

4560
03:54:32,510 --> 03:54:33,170
She would...

4561
03:54:33,790 --> 03:54:35,410
She was literally serving.

4562
03:54:35,750 --> 03:54:36,930
It was so fast.

4563
03:54:37,030 --> 03:54:37,610
It was crazy.

4564
03:54:39,470 --> 03:54:39,790
Oh.

4565
03:54:43,480 --> 03:54:44,960
Is that Ryan and Dober?

4566
03:54:45,700 --> 03:54:47,280
They're playing beach volleyball.

4567
03:54:47,280 --> 03:54:47,320
Oh.

4568
03:54:47,460 --> 03:54:48,160
That looks fine.

4569
03:54:51,200 --> 03:54:52,360
Who the hell are you?

4570
03:54:56,040 --> 03:54:57,940
Are you interested too, McQueen?

4571
03:54:59,260 --> 03:55:00,300
Inez Fujin.

4572
03:55:01,620 --> 03:55:05,620
A caring Uma Musume who perfectly fits the role of everyone's big sister.

4573
03:55:06,460 --> 03:55:06,800
Aww.

4574
03:55:09,440 --> 03:55:10,760
She serves to the beat, right?

4575
03:55:10,860 --> 03:55:11,300
I saw it too.

4576
03:55:11,460 --> 03:55:11,540
It's crazy.

4577
03:55:11,620 --> 03:55:12,540
Yeah, I think so.

4578
03:55:12,980 --> 03:55:15,180
And it sounds like a gunshot going off.

4579
03:55:15,320 --> 03:55:16,640
It's so, so fast.

4580
03:55:17,380 --> 03:55:17,680
Ma?

4581
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:20,060
She come here with them?

4582
03:55:20,480 --> 03:55:23,360
I was thinking I'd challenge Ryan in the next game, but...

4583
03:55:23,360 --> 03:55:27,500
Since you're here, why don't you join and make it a doubles match?

4584
03:55:28,180 --> 03:55:29,120
Are you sure?

4585
03:55:31,580 --> 03:55:31,880
Everybody...

4586
03:55:32,180 --> 03:55:34,520
Anybody watching whose name is Ryan?

4587
03:55:35,680 --> 03:55:36,880
Or Brian?

4588
03:55:38,800 --> 03:55:40,440
You guys are lucky today.

4589
03:55:45,280 --> 03:55:46,020
I'm going to go.

4590
03:55:46,100 --> 03:55:46,320
I'm going to go.

4591
03:55:46,580 --> 03:55:47,460
That's me.

4592
03:55:47,920 --> 03:55:48,400
Ew!

4593
03:55:52,840 --> 03:55:53,920
Ryan Reynolds?

4594
03:55:54,180 --> 03:55:56,280
I mixed that guy up the other day again.

4595
03:55:57,020 --> 03:55:58,280
With Ryan Gosling.

4596
03:56:01,480 --> 03:56:02,040
He

4597
03:56:10,520 --> 03:56:11,780
wasn't even on the street.

4598
03:56:23,250 --> 03:56:25,190
Let me know when Matts are lucky.

4599
03:56:25,450 --> 03:56:26,770
Matts are always lucky.

4600
03:56:34,840 --> 03:56:37,000
They're going to go play volleyball.

4601
03:56:37,980 --> 03:56:38,360
Oh my gosh.

4602
03:56:38,520 --> 03:56:38,660
Wait.

4603
03:56:38,940 --> 03:56:40,260
Where is Top Gun?

4604
03:56:41,640 --> 03:56:44,220
Top Gun should be there playing volleyball with them.

4605
03:56:44,260 --> 03:56:44,660
Or football.

4606
03:56:51,380 --> 03:56:53,000
Ryan, you're really something.

4607
03:56:59,020 --> 03:56:59,540
Dober.

4608
03:57:07,940 --> 03:57:10,280
I have no Top Gun too short for volleyball.

4609
03:57:10,840 --> 03:57:11,080
Wah.

4610
03:57:11,440 --> 03:57:13,600
Top Gun too busy playing this combat.

4611
03:57:25,250 --> 03:57:26,770
This is what gets me pumped.

4612
03:57:27,670 --> 03:57:28,210
Oh yeah.

4613
03:57:29,090 --> 03:57:29,510
Oh yeah.

4614
03:57:30,910 --> 03:57:32,110
Working out is my goal.

4615
03:57:32,230 --> 03:57:32,530
Damn.

4616
03:57:32,710 --> 03:57:33,790
She's just beating them up.

4617
03:57:35,090 --> 03:57:37,830
I can't believe you still have energy to spend in these conditions.

4618
03:57:39,930 --> 03:57:42,010
They play until the sun finally sets.

4619
03:57:42,250 --> 03:57:43,630
Oh, I want to go to the beach.

4620
03:57:44,470 --> 03:57:45,090
Wah.

4621
03:57:46,310 --> 03:57:49,690
I don't think I'm even going to go to the beach at all this summer.

4622
03:57:51,430 --> 03:57:52,050
Sad.

4623
03:57:52,970 --> 03:57:54,890
I want to go swimming in the beach.

4624
03:57:57,650 --> 03:58:00,290
It was certainly a fierce battle.

4625
03:58:03,170 --> 03:58:03,790
Umi.

4626
03:58:04,510 --> 03:58:04,670
Yeah.

4627
03:58:06,890 --> 03:58:08,490
Wish I had a beach bod.

4628
03:58:08,930 --> 03:58:12,450
Maybe I need to also get a beach bod before I go to the beach.

4629
03:58:18,060 --> 03:58:20,380
Where does she get that competitive strength from?

4630
03:58:21,940 --> 03:58:23,800
From her physical strength.

4631
03:58:24,400 --> 03:58:25,540
Her sheer will power.

4632
03:58:28,460 --> 03:58:30,100
No, it's physical strength.

4633
03:58:30,900 --> 03:58:31,420
I see.

4634
03:58:33,500 --> 03:58:36,160
Ryan's weight training certainly goes beyond the north.

4635
03:58:37,220 --> 03:58:37,780
Hmm.

4636
03:58:38,140 --> 03:58:38,560
Some gym.

4637
03:58:38,780 --> 03:58:40,360
Should we intensify your weight training?

4638
03:58:40,920 --> 03:58:41,280
I understand.

4639
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:45,660
It's the only bathing suit I have.

4640
03:58:48,360 --> 03:58:49,000
So...

4641
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:51,140
Unless I buy a new one...

4642
03:58:51,140 --> 03:58:53,400
Yeah, it would be me and Tsukomisu.

4643
03:58:58,790 --> 03:59:00,550
Team Red, welcome to Mambo Ship.

4644
03:59:00,710 --> 03:59:01,170
Thank you!

4645
03:59:02,990 --> 03:59:03,930
Add in more...

4646
03:59:03,930 --> 03:59:04,710
Oh, more power.

4647
03:59:05,790 --> 03:59:06,310
Nice.

4648
03:59:11,830 --> 03:59:13,710
Oh, but the rainbow stamina.

4649
03:59:14,110 --> 03:59:15,750
Look at her move and it grew.

4650
03:59:16,050 --> 03:59:17,050
It's so cute.

4651
03:59:20,250 --> 03:59:22,250
Mint would go to a nudist beach?

4652
03:59:22,430 --> 03:59:23,770
No, I would not.

4653
03:59:26,150 --> 03:59:28,490
I would not go to...

4654
03:59:28,490 --> 03:59:29,830
a nudist beach.

4655
03:59:34,790 --> 03:59:35,750
Try wit.

4656
03:59:35,750 --> 03:59:36,670
Oh, true.

4657
03:59:37,150 --> 03:59:38,110
Cause it doesn't take...

4658
03:59:38,110 --> 03:59:39,130
Oh, it actually gives some...

4659
03:59:39,130 --> 03:59:40,510
5% failure though.

4660
03:59:41,670 --> 03:59:42,030
Hmm.

4661
03:59:42,210 --> 03:59:42,750
Let's try it.

4662
03:59:45,690 --> 03:59:46,170
Success!

4663
03:59:49,270 --> 03:59:50,650
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

4664
03:59:50,770 --> 03:59:51,730
Look at her little smile.

4665
03:59:59,720 --> 04:00:03,100
Oh, that was the end of our...

4666
04:00:03,960 --> 04:00:05,260
This is the end of our...

4667
04:00:05,260 --> 04:00:06,720
Oh, we have one turn left.

4668
04:00:08,500 --> 04:00:09,400
Quite scary.

4669
04:00:10,860 --> 04:00:11,620
Gonna skip.

4670
04:00:11,980 --> 04:00:13,140
Skip, skip, skip.

4671
04:00:13,360 --> 04:00:13,880
Skip, skip, skip.

4672
04:00:15,060 --> 04:00:16,040
Skip, skip.

4673
04:00:16,740 --> 04:00:18,360
We still have a rainbow!

4674
04:00:18,780 --> 04:00:20,140
Beach over, but...

4675
04:00:20,520 --> 04:00:21,960
Our wit...

4676
04:00:22,820 --> 04:00:23,880
Is rainbow!

4677
04:00:35,220 --> 04:00:36,780
I think we'll go for it.

4678
04:00:42,000 --> 04:00:43,120
Oh, yeah.

4679
04:00:44,620 --> 04:00:45,560
Hiya, baby!

4680
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:47,220
On the training track.

4681
04:00:49,100 --> 04:00:50,100
It's race day.

4682
04:00:50,100 --> 04:00:50,120
It's race day.

4683
04:00:52,400 --> 04:00:53,300
Wait, I'm scared.

4684
04:00:56,240 --> 04:00:56,620
Uh...

4685
04:00:58,080 --> 04:00:58,460
Wait...

4686
04:00:59,380 --> 04:01:00,840
I'm just running a bit hot.

4687
04:01:01,000 --> 04:01:01,960
Thanks to this beautiful weather.

4688
04:01:02,100 --> 04:01:02,980
No, I'm gonna get you a drink.

4689
04:01:04,420 --> 04:01:05,200
I'm gonna get you a drink.

4690
04:01:05,320 --> 04:01:06,340
You're too late.

4691
04:01:07,580 --> 04:01:09,460
I'm gonna get you a drink.

4692
04:01:10,400 --> 04:01:11,300
Oh, I'm gonna get you a drink.

4693
04:01:12,960 --> 04:01:15,280
We have a lot...

4694
04:01:15,280 --> 04:01:15,920
Wow!

4695
04:01:17,340 --> 04:01:18,640
Fast and furious.

4696
04:01:18,820 --> 04:01:20,120
Increased velocity in mid race.

4697
04:01:21,520 --> 04:01:21,980
Rookie!

4698
04:01:22,600 --> 04:01:24,780
Thank you so much for the... for the redirect!

4699
04:01:25,220 --> 04:01:25,800
Thank you!

4700
04:01:26,620 --> 04:01:27,700
Thank you, thank you!

4701
04:01:29,220 --> 04:01:31,900
We're about to do our big race, everybody, coming in.

4702
04:01:32,560 --> 04:01:33,420
I'm scared.

4703
04:01:33,660 --> 04:01:34,460
We gotta...

4704
04:01:35,640 --> 04:01:38,340
We gotta buy... skills.

4705
04:01:38,520 --> 04:01:40,440
But if I buy this one, that's like everything.

4706
04:01:40,600 --> 04:01:42,240
But it's like, also...

4707
04:01:44,300 --> 04:01:46,340
It's golden, it seems like it's really good.

4708
04:01:49,460 --> 04:01:50,380
Wrong poor rabbit!

4709
04:01:50,480 --> 04:01:51,300
Thank you so much for the gifted!

4710
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:54,100
Hmm... let's see.

4711
04:01:54,940 --> 04:01:56,020
Late surger.

4712
04:02:01,100 --> 04:02:02,100
Slightly increase.

4713
04:02:02,480 --> 04:02:03,010
This is increase...

4714
04:02:03,780 --> 04:02:05,860
Slightly increase velocity on a corner.

4715
04:02:07,880 --> 04:02:08,920
Keeping the lead.

4716
04:02:09,160 --> 04:02:12,800
Slightly increase ability to maintain the lead when leading by a large margin iteration.

4717
04:02:16,220 --> 04:02:17,640
Wrong style for her.

4718
04:02:18,320 --> 04:02:19,400
The late surger.

4719
04:02:19,600 --> 04:02:20,900
Cause she is...

4720
04:02:21,320 --> 04:02:22,400
Pace chaser, right?

4721
04:02:32,730 --> 04:02:35,730
The only one thinks pace... chaser or long.

4722
04:02:36,150 --> 04:02:37,210
This one's long.

4723
04:02:38,690 --> 04:02:40,210
Home stretch is good too.

4724
04:02:41,250 --> 04:02:43,230
Slightly increase velocity in the last spurt.

4725
04:02:45,530 --> 04:02:48,630
Slightly increase velocity when passing another runner mid-race.

4726
04:02:49,550 --> 04:02:52,150
Slightly decrease time loss to slow start.

4727
04:02:53,690 --> 04:02:54,790
Kind of need that.

4728
04:02:57,930 --> 04:03:01,030
Slightly recover endurance on a corner with efficient turning.

4729
04:03:04,330 --> 04:03:06,010
Ramp up and maybe focus.

4730
04:03:07,310 --> 04:03:07,950
Let's see, hold on.

4731
04:03:10,050 --> 04:03:12,670
Or wait, the home stretch haste.

4732
04:03:13,850 --> 04:03:14,270
Oh...

4733
04:03:22,140 --> 04:03:23,180
Wait, where did it go?

4734
04:03:24,460 --> 04:03:25,600
Wait, where did it go?

4735
04:03:25,600 --> 04:03:26,600
The thing that I...

4736
04:03:27,140 --> 04:03:27,960
Oh, here.

4737
04:03:29,580 --> 04:03:31,220
The recovery skills.

4738
04:03:31,740 --> 04:03:35,600
Maybe not the home stretch, but maybe...

4739
04:03:39,080 --> 04:03:40,120
Well, we have...

4740
04:03:42,220 --> 04:03:43,300
We have...

4741
04:03:44,900 --> 04:03:45,620
The...

4742
04:03:45,620 --> 04:03:47,340
The turn corner skill.

4743
04:03:50,340 --> 04:03:51,880
Like, we have one.

4744
04:03:52,120 --> 04:03:53,400
Do they stack, I guess?

4745
04:04:01,000 --> 04:04:04,360
Summer class has been taking my time, but with you back makes it better.

4746
04:04:04,480 --> 04:04:05,720
Boy, Sapphire!

4747
04:04:06,700 --> 04:04:07,540
I hope...

4748
04:04:07,540 --> 04:04:08,440
I hope...

4749
04:04:08,440 --> 04:04:10,040
I hope your classes are going well.

4750
04:04:14,500 --> 04:04:15,940
Home stretch plus recovery?

4751
04:04:16,580 --> 04:04:17,260
Oh, really?

4752
04:04:17,360 --> 04:04:18,140
Instead of ramp up?

4753
04:04:19,700 --> 04:04:20,360
Okay, yeah.

4754
04:04:20,740 --> 04:04:21,260
Okay, okay.

4755
04:04:21,760 --> 04:04:22,560
Okay, okay, okay.

4756
04:04:23,040 --> 04:04:23,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4757
04:04:23,700 --> 04:04:24,320
I see the vision.

4758
04:04:25,060 --> 04:04:25,900
Which... Which...

4759
04:04:25,900 --> 04:04:28,560
This one is cheaper, so I feel like I should get it.

4760
04:04:29,980 --> 04:04:30,700
You know?

4761
04:04:30,960 --> 04:04:33,640
I feel like the straightaway might be better just because...

4762
04:04:33,640 --> 04:04:35,680
Then we'll have more skill points for next time, too.

4763
04:04:38,200 --> 04:04:38,740
Get corner?

4764
04:04:38,940 --> 04:04:39,560
Is a corner that...

4765
04:04:40,400 --> 04:04:41,220
Is better?

4766
04:04:43,660 --> 04:04:44,700
Corner is better.

4767
04:04:48,420 --> 04:04:49,620
It's about like...

4768
04:04:49,620 --> 04:04:52,120
A little less than 40 points, we say.

4769
04:04:55,460 --> 04:04:56,560
Corner is stronger.

4770
04:04:56,860 --> 04:04:57,120
Okay!

4771
04:04:57,980 --> 04:04:58,520
Okay.

4772
04:04:58,980 --> 04:05:01,340
I will go with what you guys say since you're helping me out.

4773
04:05:01,620 --> 04:05:02,240
Thank you!

4774
04:05:05,060 --> 04:05:05,600
No!

4775
04:05:05,840 --> 04:05:06,140
Learn!

4776
04:05:09,230 --> 04:05:09,990
All right.

4777
04:05:10,110 --> 04:05:13,170
All right!

4778
04:05:13,730 --> 04:05:16,870
All right!

4779
04:05:18,910 --> 04:05:21,590
Straightaway runs the risk of activating right after starting.

4780
04:05:21,830 --> 04:05:22,850
No kidding!

4781
04:05:23,570 --> 04:05:23,930
Oh...

4782
04:05:23,930 --> 04:05:24,550
I see, I see.

4783
04:05:26,210 --> 04:05:26,690
All right.

4784
04:05:28,210 --> 04:05:28,970
You guys ready?

4785
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:30,610
Obviously, no skip.

4786
04:05:30,970 --> 04:05:31,730
No, just in case.

4787
04:05:31,890 --> 04:05:33,050
I don't think it will, but...

4788
04:05:33,770 --> 04:05:35,430
You can only compete in the goal race.

4789
04:05:35,610 --> 04:05:36,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4790
04:05:40,150 --> 04:05:40,510
Wait.

4791
04:05:41,250 --> 04:05:42,430
I kind of want to see the predictions.

4792
04:05:44,230 --> 04:05:45,010
A top contender.

4793
04:05:46,950 --> 04:05:47,670
I'm scared.

4794
04:05:47,670 --> 04:05:48,550
I'm scared.

4795
04:05:51,690 --> 04:05:54,610
We need to ensure I'm properly positioned for the initial slope.

4796
04:05:55,650 --> 04:05:56,650
Think you can do it?

4797
04:05:57,470 --> 04:05:57,830
Yes.

4798
04:05:58,990 --> 04:06:00,510
I can picture it in my head.

4799
04:06:01,650 --> 04:06:04,710
The Kolbe Shimbun High is 2,400 meters on turf.

4800
04:06:07,050 --> 04:06:11,030
As long as I can remember all the training I've done up to this point, it won't be a problem.

4801
04:06:11,030 --> 04:06:12,510
I'll show you the strength of the Mejiro.

4802
04:06:17,590 --> 04:06:18,890
Believe in your Uma.

4803
04:06:20,910 --> 04:06:23,350
I shall stay focused and secure victory!

4804
04:06:23,770 --> 04:06:24,870
I believe in her.

4805
04:06:28,170 --> 04:06:29,610
Oh, she's still the favorite!

4806
04:06:32,710 --> 04:06:34,970
Look how beautiful she is.

4807
04:06:36,050 --> 04:06:38,130
Wait, should we try...

4808
04:06:38,770 --> 04:06:39,210
Um...

4809
04:06:39,210 --> 04:06:40,850
Doing it in landscape mode?

4810
04:06:41,170 --> 04:06:41,910
Or, uh...

4811
04:06:41,910 --> 04:06:42,310
What's it called?

4812
04:06:42,390 --> 04:06:42,930
Vertical mode?

4813
04:06:43,150 --> 04:06:43,830
Can I change it here?

4814
04:06:50,870 --> 04:06:51,470
Maybe I...

4815
04:06:51,470 --> 04:06:51,770
Oh, wait.

4816
04:06:55,580 --> 04:06:56,620
Is this G2?

4817
04:07:03,270 --> 04:07:04,350
Not this man, yo.

4818
04:07:11,820 --> 04:07:12,260
Dang.

4819
04:07:14,100 --> 04:07:14,720
It's G...

4820
04:07:14,720 --> 04:07:15,400
Oh, it is G2!

4821
04:07:16,620 --> 04:07:17,060
Okay.

4822
04:07:17,300 --> 04:07:18,000
Well, anyway, let's race.

4823
04:07:19,460 --> 04:07:20,200
I'm scared.

4824
04:07:22,560 --> 04:07:24,280
It's downloading a lot.

4825
04:07:28,920 --> 04:07:30,760
Maybe it was downloading the outfit.

4826
04:07:34,860 --> 04:07:36,500
Oh, special week.

4827
04:07:37,460 --> 04:07:38,760
Everybody's so low-res.

4828
04:07:42,020 --> 04:07:44,260
Oh, Roy's shower again.

4829
04:07:52,870 --> 04:07:54,610
Believe in your Uma.

4830
04:07:55,910 --> 04:07:57,090
Asian Flash.

4831
04:08:10,460 --> 04:08:11,100
Oh!

4832
04:08:12,840 --> 04:08:14,620
I don't even know the Silent Suzu.

4833
04:08:15,000 --> 04:08:18,040
I don't even know the Silent Suzu.

4834
04:08:20,960 --> 04:08:22,100
Special week.

4835
04:08:22,100 --> 04:08:22,940
Special week.

4836
04:08:25,040 --> 04:08:25,480
Nice!

4837
04:08:42,020 --> 04:08:43,160
It's okay.

4838
04:08:43,320 --> 04:08:47,020
I'm scared.

4839
04:08:47,020 --> 04:08:56,560
I'm scared... Oh my god, with her colors and her hair, I thought that was... I thought that was...

4840
04:08:56,560 --> 04:08:59,900
I thought that was... Tai Hato!

4841
04:09:01,620 --> 04:09:01,940
Oh, oh!

4842
04:09:01,940 --> 04:09:04,600
Corner, corner!

4843
04:09:04,960 --> 04:09:05,880
Nice, nice, nice!

4844
04:09:08,300 --> 04:09:10,860
This is a long race here, right?

4845
04:09:13,520 --> 04:09:14,580
Oh...

4846
04:09:15,940 --> 04:09:17,000
Oh...

4847
04:09:17,000 --> 04:09:18,100
Yeah, Hachama!

4848
04:09:20,540 --> 04:09:21,600
Hachama!

4849
04:09:21,620 --> 04:09:22,300
Oh...

4850
04:09:22,300 --> 04:09:27,160
Come on, McQueen!

4851
04:09:34,360 --> 04:09:37,680
Wow, San Francisco is holding...

4852
04:09:37,680 --> 04:09:38,280
Oh...

4853
04:09:40,820 --> 04:09:46,140
Okay, we're... we're closing the gap, we're closing the gap!

4854
04:09:46,320 --> 04:09:54,900
Oh, we're closing the gap, we're closing the gap!

4855
04:09:54,900 --> 04:09:55,320
하!

4856
04:09:59,780 --> 04:10:00,740
TEA TIME!!!!

4857
04:10:04,180 --> 04:10:06,380
Didn't she activate it a little early though...?

4858
04:10:06,380 --> 04:10:07,280
I feel..

4859
04:10:07,280 --> 04:10:08,000
don't know...

4860
04:10:12,120 --> 04:10:17,700
Oh my God...!

4861
04:10:17,700 --> 04:10:18,140
Wait...!

4862
04:10:18,640 --> 04:10:20,720
Oh my God...oh my God...Oh my God...!

4863
04:10:20,720 --> 04:10:21,460
Oh my God...!

4864
04:10:21,460 --> 04:10:21,840
Oh my God...!

4865
04:10:21,840 --> 04:10:21,960
Oh my God...!

4866
04:10:21,960 --> 04:10:22,760
Oh my God...!

4867
04:10:22,760 --> 04:10:23,200
Oh my God...!

4868
04:10:26,480 --> 04:10:27,840
Mejiro McQueen!

4869
04:10:28,240 --> 04:10:29,180
Oh my god!

4870
04:10:29,320 --> 04:10:31,400
Kachau, kachau, kachau, kachau, kachau!

4871
04:10:33,740 --> 04:10:35,180
I think this is it.

4872
04:10:35,800 --> 04:10:36,620
This is it!

4873
04:10:37,120 --> 04:10:38,140
Mejiro McQueen!

4874
04:10:39,800 --> 04:10:41,240
Mejiro McQueen!

4875
04:10:44,240 --> 04:10:45,000
Oh!

4876
04:10:46,320 --> 04:10:47,760
Mejiro McQueen!

4877
04:10:47,900 --> 04:10:48,440
Mejiro McQueen!

4878
04:10:48,440 --> 04:10:49,620
The second one is A-Shin Flash!

4879
04:10:49,880 --> 04:10:51,500
The third one is Rice Shower!

4880
04:10:52,280 --> 04:10:53,000
Oh!

4881
04:10:54,540 --> 04:10:56,680
Oh my gosh...

4882
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:00,720
Wow!

4883
04:11:04,760 --> 04:11:05,900
Holy moly!

4884
04:11:07,000 --> 04:11:09,100
We've gotten first every try!

4885
04:11:09,840 --> 04:11:10,900
I was really scared.

4886
04:11:11,020 --> 04:11:12,340
Rice Shower came out of nowhere.

4887
04:11:14,320 --> 04:11:15,580
Wait, where did...

4888
04:11:15,580 --> 04:11:17,260
Suzuka end up in seventh?

4889
04:11:17,580 --> 04:11:17,860
Dang.

4890
04:11:21,400 --> 04:11:23,400
Rice Shower came out of nowhere!

4891
04:11:24,480 --> 04:11:25,360
Holy cow!

4892
04:11:28,700 --> 04:11:29,940
What a victory!

4893
04:11:30,200 --> 04:11:30,880
Seven lengths!

4894
04:11:31,040 --> 04:11:31,760
Yeah, baby!

4895
04:11:33,000 --> 04:11:33,720
Silver!

4896
04:11:42,250 --> 04:11:44,550
That was a favorable outcome.

4897
04:11:44,970 --> 04:11:46,230
She's so happy.

4898
04:11:46,230 --> 04:11:46,930
Hahaha!

4899
04:11:51,840 --> 04:11:52,660
Let's go!

4900
04:11:53,280 --> 04:11:53,800
Sorry...

4901
04:11:53,800 --> 04:11:54,660
Uh...

4902
04:11:54,660 --> 04:11:55,260
Next up...

4903
04:11:55,260 --> 04:11:57,160
Next up is the Kikukashou!

4904
04:11:58,400 --> 04:11:58,920
Eh...

4905
04:11:58,920 --> 04:12:01,180
My mind has been set on this race all year.

4906
04:12:01,400 --> 04:12:02,460
I mustn't lose.

4907
04:12:04,240 --> 04:12:06,920
I must secure this win and add it to my list of achievements!

4908
04:12:08,180 --> 04:12:09,220
And further...

4909
04:12:09,220 --> 04:12:13,740
With the Kikukashou being the final classics race, Ryan will certainly be competing.

4910
04:12:14,000 --> 04:12:14,180
Woah!

4911
04:12:14,180 --> 04:12:14,840
Oh...

4912
04:12:16,700 --> 04:12:18,060
Family rivalry...

4913
04:12:18,060 --> 04:12:18,480
Go...

4914
04:12:18,480 --> 04:12:18,920
Oh, sure!

4915
04:12:20,060 --> 04:12:22,080
Thank you so much for the pity gets it!

4916
04:12:22,320 --> 04:12:22,760
Thank you!

4917
04:12:25,280 --> 04:12:26,300
Something wrong?

4918
04:12:27,960 --> 04:12:28,640
Iie...

4919
04:12:28,640 --> 04:12:29,180
Iie...

4920
04:12:29,920 --> 04:12:30,420
Let's go!

4921
04:12:30,940 --> 04:12:31,160
Let's go!

4922
04:12:31,160 --> 04:12:33,360
I was just picturing the path to victory once again.

4923
04:12:33,600 --> 04:12:35,300
I will certainly win the next race as well.

4924
04:12:36,440 --> 04:12:37,180
Speared one up!

4925
04:12:37,660 --> 04:12:38,380
Stamina up!

4926
04:12:38,860 --> 04:12:39,520
Guts up!

4927
04:12:40,160 --> 04:12:40,800
Wit up!

4928
04:12:40,800 --> 04:12:42,120
Skill points!

4929
04:12:42,380 --> 04:12:42,840
Up!

4930
04:12:44,240 --> 04:12:45,120
Nice!

4931
04:12:46,280 --> 04:12:47,640
Mejiro McGull!

4932
04:12:51,080 --> 04:12:52,440
Yippee!

4933
04:12:56,940 --> 04:12:58,300
Huh?

4934
04:13:01,290 --> 04:13:03,630
What do you mean, one turn?

4935
04:13:07,090 --> 04:13:07,770
Huh?

4936
04:13:21,800 --> 04:13:24,960
I was going to call it, but...

4937
04:13:31,480 --> 04:13:33,060
Some are zero turns.

4938
04:13:38,380 --> 04:13:38,900
Wait,

4939
04:13:42,960 --> 04:13:43,400
what's happening?

4940
04:13:45,780 --> 04:13:47,080
Is there drama?

4941
04:13:47,260 --> 04:13:47,980
Versus Ryan.

4942
04:13:48,260 --> 04:13:48,480
Uh oh.

4943
04:13:50,500 --> 04:13:52,220
Good point to save and quit though.

4944
04:13:52,460 --> 04:13:53,300
I'm just going to skip this.

4945
04:14:01,180 --> 04:14:04,200
Dutututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututut They're almost at the end,

4946
04:14:04,240 --> 04:14:04,540
I think.

4947
04:14:05,060 --> 04:14:09,440
Maybe I... just do this race, since it's only one turn away.

4948
04:14:11,940 --> 04:14:15,480
So... okay... um... speed!

4949
04:14:16,440 --> 04:14:18,120
Oh, yes, speed.

4950
04:14:19,700 --> 04:14:21,160
Okay, one more race, baby.

4951
04:14:38,280 --> 04:14:39,480
Uh-oh.

4952
04:14:39,920 --> 04:14:40,500
Migraine?

4953
04:14:40,760 --> 04:14:41,740
Oh, no, no, no.

4954
04:14:42,060 --> 04:14:42,580
Uh-oh.

4955
04:14:57,010 --> 04:14:58,870
You hate to see it.

4956
04:14:59,130 --> 04:15:00,870
Can I even afford anything?

4957
04:15:09,850 --> 04:15:10,410
Uh...

4958
04:15:15,810 --> 04:15:16,090
uh...

4959
04:15:16,370 --> 04:15:18,030
Oh, down before the race.

4960
04:15:19,850 --> 04:15:20,410
Uh...

4961
04:15:23,030 --> 04:15:24,750
Check the race conditions.

4962
04:15:24,930 --> 04:15:25,550
How do I see that?

4963
04:15:26,810 --> 04:15:27,550
Like here?

4964
04:15:28,590 --> 04:15:30,070
How do you save in this game?

4965
04:15:30,250 --> 04:15:31,250
That is perfect.

4966
04:15:34,130 --> 04:15:35,430
It'd be better to save.

4967
04:15:35,770 --> 04:15:38,190
Wait, how do I... Actually, how do you save in this game?

4968
04:15:39,030 --> 04:15:39,510
Here?

4969
04:15:39,810 --> 04:15:40,170
Oh.

4970
04:15:41,010 --> 04:15:41,630
Give up.

4971
04:15:42,070 --> 04:15:42,990
Save and exit.

4972
04:15:47,220 --> 04:15:48,440
No, click on race.

4973
04:15:49,200 --> 04:15:49,540
Oh.

4974
04:16:00,980 --> 04:16:02,000
Oh, it's long.

4975
04:16:02,800 --> 04:16:03,280
Yeah.

4976
04:16:05,180 --> 04:16:06,200
It's a long race.

4977
04:16:06,300 --> 04:16:07,980
Yeah, so we don't want to do the...

4978
04:16:07,980 --> 04:16:10,440
The skill for mile, right?

4979
04:16:11,060 --> 04:16:13,560
Because it won't have any effect.

4980
04:16:14,160 --> 04:16:15,460
Assume that's how that works?

4981
04:16:17,420 --> 04:16:20,100
Moderately increases performance over standard distances.

4982
04:16:21,000 --> 04:16:22,280
Multiples of 400 meters.

4983
04:16:23,260 --> 04:16:25,240
Moderately increased performance on firm ground.

4984
04:16:27,220 --> 04:16:29,960
So, wouldn't this do good then?

4985
04:16:30,140 --> 04:16:31,100
The standard distance?

4986
04:16:37,230 --> 04:16:38,450
Firm is solid?

4987
04:16:38,970 --> 04:16:39,350
Oh, yeah?

4988
04:16:49,740 --> 04:16:50,800
Firm is better?

4989
04:16:51,560 --> 04:16:52,200
Firm is better?

4990
04:16:54,960 --> 04:16:56,820
Well, 3000 is not standard.

4991
04:16:57,820 --> 04:16:58,760
Multiples of 400.

4992
04:16:59,940 --> 04:17:01,780
I can... Okay, we'll do this one, then.

4993
04:17:02,620 --> 04:17:03,720
We'll at least get this.

4994
04:17:07,750 --> 04:17:09,070
So, we have a...

4995
04:17:09,070 --> 04:17:09,350
Vim...

4996
04:17:09,350 --> 04:17:09,770
Vim...

4997
04:17:09,770 --> 04:17:10,990
Vim...

4998
04:17:10,990 --> 04:17:11,590
Vim...

4999
04:17:11,590 --> 04:17:11,650
Vim...

5000
04:17:11,650 --> 04:17:12,290
Vim...

5001
04:17:12,290 --> 04:17:12,610
Vim...

5002
04:17:12,610 --> 04:17:13,190
Vim...

5003
04:17:21,430 --> 04:17:22,070
Vim...

5004
04:17:22,070 --> 04:17:25,350
I don't go swimming so much though.

5005
04:17:25,970 --> 04:17:26,970
Thank you.

5006
04:17:27,550 --> 04:17:28,970
That was ages ago.

5007
04:17:29,450 --> 04:17:33,310
Sorry, I think there was a backlog because of some gifted members.

5008
04:17:34,470 --> 04:17:34,930
Okay.

5009
04:17:37,370 --> 04:17:39,450
Luckily, her mood is still good.

5010
04:17:39,650 --> 04:17:43,510
It's not great, but... Alright.

5011
04:17:46,870 --> 04:17:47,590
Okay.

5012
04:17:52,070 --> 04:17:53,910
Do you believe me?

5013
04:17:53,910 --> 04:17:54,950
I think it's very good.

5014
04:18:01,140 --> 04:18:02,320
Place top three.

5015
04:18:06,020 --> 04:18:07,180
The Kikukashou.

5016
04:18:10,880 --> 04:18:12,520
Our first G1 race?

5017
04:18:13,500 --> 04:18:14,000
Scary!

5018
04:18:16,380 --> 04:18:18,240
Oh boy, I'm looking forward to this.

5019
04:18:18,340 --> 04:18:19,480
The Kikukashou!

5020
04:18:20,300 --> 04:18:23,580
And this time there's going to be a Mejiro family showdown, right?

5021
04:18:24,300 --> 04:18:25,060
That's right.

5022
04:18:25,280 --> 04:18:28,240
I hope you brought a fan because this race is going to get heated.

5023
04:18:30,380 --> 04:18:31,460
They're quite excited.

5024
04:18:31,660 --> 04:18:33,120
I can hear them all the way from here.

5025
04:18:34,680 --> 04:18:36,540
That's because it's a triple crown race.

5026
04:18:37,920 --> 04:18:38,320
Indeed.

5027
04:18:38,640 --> 04:18:42,420
An opportunity coveted by any and all of Umu Musume.

5028
04:18:43,880 --> 04:18:47,060
Beyond that for me, it is a chance to truly compete against Ryan.

5029
04:18:49,300 --> 04:18:49,940
It's strange.

5030
04:18:50,240 --> 04:18:53,980
Long before this, the two of us would race against each other, but there were no spectators back then.

5031
04:18:53,980 --> 04:18:55,940
Now all eyes are on us.

5032
04:18:56,780 --> 04:18:59,540
I'm sure everyone in the Mejiro family is watching us as well.

5033
04:19:00,620 --> 04:19:02,300
You'll have to run with dignity then.

5034
04:19:03,660 --> 04:19:04,180
Yes.

5035
04:19:04,380 --> 04:19:05,840
I mustn't embarrass myself.

5036
04:19:07,220 --> 04:19:08,820
Even if my opponent is Ryan.

5037
04:19:09,500 --> 04:19:10,020
No.

5038
04:19:10,280 --> 04:19:12,300
Especially because my opponent is Ryan.

5039
04:19:12,560 --> 04:19:15,700
Someone whom I respect, I must gain a victory most magnificent.

5040
04:19:16,520 --> 04:19:18,120
Wee-hee-hee-hee.

5041
04:19:18,300 --> 04:19:19,120
Thanks for the gifted.

5042
04:19:20,920 --> 04:19:22,300
Want to see the song after.

5043
04:19:22,440 --> 04:19:23,780
I do, I do, I do!

5044
04:19:24,600 --> 04:19:26,200
We'll end on a concert!

5045
04:19:28,200 --> 04:19:28,600
Okay.

5046
04:19:28,600 --> 04:19:28,980
Okay.

5047
04:19:34,490 --> 04:19:36,250
She seems to be in a great mood.

5048
04:19:36,430 --> 04:19:37,970
Well, she's in a good mood, but, you know.

5049
04:19:38,810 --> 04:19:39,530
Let's go.

5050
04:19:40,830 --> 04:19:42,670
All we can do... is try.

5051
04:19:43,390 --> 04:19:44,810
All we can do is our best!

5052
04:19:46,290 --> 04:19:47,030
And root!

5053
04:19:47,890 --> 04:19:49,210
Root for our Uma!

5054
04:19:55,890 --> 04:19:56,770
Where is she?

5055
04:20:00,200 --> 04:20:00,660
Ah.

5056
04:20:02,120 --> 04:20:02,960
Nejiro Ryan.

5057
04:20:04,180 --> 04:20:04,700
Okay.

5058
04:20:06,420 --> 04:20:08,320
The winner is this one!

5059
04:20:09,000 --> 04:20:10,220
Ryan's here too.

5060
04:20:10,440 --> 04:20:11,020
Oh gosh.

5061
04:20:11,500 --> 04:20:11,560
Oh gosh!

5062
04:20:24,460 --> 04:20:25,260
Kikkaoooooo!

5063
04:20:28,020 --> 04:20:28,100
Kikka!

5064
04:20:28,360 --> 04:20:29,160
Kikka!

5065
04:20:30,700 --> 04:20:31,500
Kikka!

5066
04:20:33,640 --> 04:20:34,440
Kikka!

5067
04:20:41,800 --> 04:20:42,600
Kikka!

5068
04:20:42,600 --> 04:20:46,280
Ryan and Brian!

5069
04:20:46,720 --> 04:20:48,060
This is messed up!

5070
04:20:52,240 --> 04:20:53,060
Ready!

5071
04:20:56,180 --> 04:20:56,480
Start!

5072
04:21:03,460 --> 04:21:04,580
Wow...

5073
04:21:05,600 --> 04:21:07,600
Spass, spass, spass!

5074
04:21:24,360 --> 04:21:27,080
And the dirt is restored.

5075
04:21:33,880 --> 04:21:34,200
Okay.

5076
04:21:35,320 --> 04:21:36,680
Come on, go, go, go!

5077
04:21:39,160 --> 04:21:39,980
I...I believe in her.

5078
04:21:40,080 --> 04:21:41,840
I believe she can...I believe she can close the gap.

5079
04:21:41,840 --> 04:21:42,940
I believe she could close the gap.

5080
04:21:46,020 --> 04:21:47,460
Oh my gosh.

5081
04:21:48,300 --> 04:21:49,320
Oh, come on!

5082
04:21:51,300 --> 04:21:52,620
No, no, no, no, no...

5083
04:21:52,620 --> 04:21:58,040
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...

5084
04:21:58,040 --> 04:21:58,600
That was fine.

5085
04:21:58,740 --> 04:22:00,180
We're still just in the middle of the match.

5086
04:22:00,880 --> 04:22:01,480
Anyone's game?

5087
04:22:02,300 --> 04:22:02,920
Anyone's game?

5088
04:22:05,800 --> 04:22:06,680
It's still early.

5089
04:22:07,800 --> 04:22:09,040
Quarter adept, let's go!

5090
04:22:15,620 --> 04:22:16,880
She's keeping a good pace.

5091
04:22:18,860 --> 04:22:21,760
It's really, it's really close between her and that other girl.

5092
04:22:24,200 --> 04:22:24,640
Okay.

5093
04:22:26,860 --> 04:22:28,140
Okay, she's closing the gap.

5094
04:22:28,280 --> 04:22:28,760
She's closing the gap.

5095
04:22:28,800 --> 04:22:29,280
She's getting there.

5096
04:22:29,720 --> 04:22:31,700
Oh, it's really... Oh, gosh.

5097
04:22:46,280 --> 04:22:47,320
Look at her go!

5098
04:22:47,420 --> 04:22:47,940
Look at her go!

5099
04:22:48,020 --> 04:22:48,700
She's so cute!

5100
04:22:50,900 --> 04:22:51,660
Believe, believe!

5101
04:22:53,660 --> 04:22:57,020
Alright, if she can ult... She's already in second though!

5102
04:22:57,120 --> 04:22:57,800
She's doing great!

5103
04:22:57,800 --> 04:22:57,800
Wait!

5104
04:22:58,200 --> 04:22:58,200
No!

5105
04:22:59,100 --> 04:22:59,980
Oh, big lead!

5106
04:23:05,660 --> 04:23:06,100
Yes!

5107
04:23:07,020 --> 04:23:07,280
Yes!

5108
04:23:10,340 --> 04:23:10,740
Yeah!

5109
04:23:12,380 --> 04:23:13,020
Keep going!

5110
04:23:13,180 --> 04:23:13,500
Oh, my gosh.

5111
04:23:13,620 --> 04:23:13,720
Wait!

5112
04:23:13,960 --> 04:23:14,200
What?

5113
04:23:14,420 --> 04:23:14,640
No!

5114
04:23:16,400 --> 04:23:17,080
Keep going!

5115
04:23:17,320 --> 04:23:17,600
Keep going!

5116
04:23:17,800 --> 04:23:18,320
Keep going!

5117
04:23:18,760 --> 04:23:19,380
Come on!

5118
04:23:19,560 --> 04:23:20,200
Come on!

5119
04:23:20,380 --> 04:23:21,120
You're so close!

5120
04:23:22,440 --> 04:23:23,140
Oh, my God!

5121
04:23:23,280 --> 04:23:23,440
Oh, my God!

5122
04:23:23,760 --> 04:23:24,000
Oh, my God!

5123
04:23:24,060 --> 04:23:25,320
Oh, my God!

5124
04:23:25,320 --> 04:23:25,320
No!

5125
04:23:25,440 --> 04:23:25,880
No!

5126
04:23:25,880 --> 04:23:26,040
No!

5127
04:23:26,080 --> 04:23:26,100
No!

5128
04:23:26,140 --> 04:23:27,080
We just need to be top three!

5129
04:23:27,080 --> 04:23:27,780
Air!

5130
04:23:40,610 --> 04:23:43,370
Oh, my God!

5131
04:23:43,370 --> 04:23:44,890
We have taken a beat in the Kikuno's隊.

5132
04:23:46,610 --> 04:23:48,090
The second one is the B.W.

5133
04:23:48,510 --> 04:23:48,550
R.I.

5134
04:23:48,550 --> 04:23:48,890
H.I.

5135
04:23:48,930 --> 04:23:50,590
The third one is the M.L.I.

5136
04:23:53,930 --> 04:23:54,770
I think I will be the third sentence.

5137
04:23:56,090 --> 04:23:57,070
I will still be the next one.

5138
04:24:11,530 --> 04:24:12,910
Should we try again?

5139
04:24:17,580 --> 04:24:19,340
We have a 3-year-old?

5140
04:24:24,400 --> 04:24:25,100
Come on!

5141
04:24:26,760 --> 04:24:28,180
We were so close!

5142
04:24:28,180 --> 04:24:30,820
We are freaking... not Brian.

5143
04:24:31,040 --> 04:24:32,820
Brian ran right in front of us, too!

5144
04:24:38,840 --> 04:24:39,720
So close...

5145
04:24:46,100 --> 04:24:47,260
It was just a dream.

5146
04:24:50,260 --> 04:24:51,540
The mood is great now!

5147
04:24:53,600 --> 04:24:54,820
Wait, this might be good!

5148
04:24:55,620 --> 04:24:56,680
It was just a dream!

5149
04:24:57,020 --> 04:24:58,260
That's why she was feeling bad!

5150
04:25:01,840 --> 04:25:02,400
Okay...

5151
04:25:14,530 --> 04:25:15,990
Is everybody the same, too?

5152
04:25:16,750 --> 04:25:17,310
Right?

5153
04:25:20,310 --> 04:25:20,870
Yeah...

5154
04:25:20,870 --> 04:25:21,670
Yeah...

5155
04:25:24,860 --> 04:25:25,420
Okay...

5156
04:25:29,780 --> 04:25:31,760
All we can do is our best.

5157
04:25:34,580 --> 04:25:36,680
The mood makes a big difference, does it?

5158
04:25:55,420 --> 04:25:55,980
Oh...

5159
04:25:55,980 --> 04:25:59,900
Wake up Mick Queen!

5160
04:26:00,200 --> 04:26:00,560
Cacciao!

5161
04:26:00,940 --> 04:26:01,480
Wake up Mick Queen!

5162
04:26:01,500 --> 04:26:01,920
Cacciao!

5163
04:26:02,040 --> 04:26:02,880
Wake up Mick Queen!

5164
04:26:03,160 --> 04:26:03,720
Cacciao!

5165
04:26:10,000 --> 04:26:11,900
Why is it black there?

5166
04:26:12,280 --> 04:26:13,620
That looks like a little emoji.

5167
04:26:20,900 --> 04:26:22,020
Oh,

5168
04:26:27,740 --> 04:26:29,300
it's all looking very familiar.

5169
04:26:35,200 --> 04:26:38,840
She doesn't have enough stamina.

5170
04:26:46,800 --> 04:26:47,900
She's going, she's going.

5171
04:26:48,300 --> 04:26:49,700
Look at her, catching up!

5172
04:26:55,280 --> 04:26:55,920
10th place!

5173
04:26:56,200 --> 04:26:57,200
Oh my god, this is so bad.

5174
04:27:00,360 --> 04:27:01,480
Is the guy still early?

5175
04:27:02,940 --> 04:27:05,260
Let's just hope that the other girls have bad stamina.

5176
04:27:14,720 --> 04:27:15,620
Come on, the queen!

5177
04:27:16,400 --> 04:27:17,260
She's catching up.

5178
04:27:19,240 --> 04:27:20,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5179
04:27:20,380 --> 04:27:21,260
Look at her go, look at her go.

5180
04:27:23,080 --> 04:27:24,700
There's a girl named I am queen.

5181
04:27:25,000 --> 04:27:26,340
There can only be one queen.

5182
04:27:26,340 --> 04:27:28,140
Oh.

5183
04:27:33,920 --> 04:27:37,480
Still... Still early?

5184
04:27:37,640 --> 04:27:37,660
Ish.

5185
04:27:37,660 --> 04:27:38,100
Eh?

5186
04:27:39,140 --> 04:27:51,780
I'm scared!

5187
04:27:52,240 --> 04:27:54,300
I'm scared!

5188
04:28:07,840 --> 04:28:14,600
1,000m, in the outside, the remaining 1,000m, 8th, the other, the 13th, and the other, the other, the other, the other, the other...

5189
04:28:14,600 --> 04:28:14,600
Okay.

5190
04:28:15,300 --> 04:28:16,060
Good pace.

5191
04:28:16,660 --> 04:28:17,040
Whoa.

5192
04:28:17,980 --> 04:28:18,340
Whoa.

5193
04:28:20,800 --> 04:28:21,320
Whoa.

5194
04:28:24,880 --> 04:28:25,960
She's saving her skill.

5195
04:28:27,740 --> 04:28:31,840
But also... she didn't have any corner skills or anything.

5196
04:28:33,620 --> 04:28:35,320
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

5197
04:28:35,320 --> 04:28:37,580
Excuse me, please raise your ult!

5198
04:28:38,820 --> 04:28:39,560
Please!

5199
04:29:16,500 --> 04:29:18,820
Even worse than before!

5200
04:29:33,460 --> 04:29:34,200
I

5201
04:29:38,160 --> 04:29:41,460
think this is it for this run.

5202
04:29:45,160 --> 04:29:46,120
Dignity forgotten.

5203
04:29:46,740 --> 04:29:48,380
I'm afraid this run is cooked, sir.

5204
04:29:48,700 --> 04:29:49,980
I think so too.

5205
04:29:51,440 --> 04:29:53,780
Can't end it on an ult-less run!

5206
04:29:56,880 --> 04:29:59,640
So we try one more time and see if she ults.

5207
04:29:59,760 --> 04:30:00,780
Why didn't she ult?

5208
04:30:00,900 --> 04:30:02,140
She was in such a good position!

5209
04:30:13,060 --> 04:30:14,080
One more time.

5210
04:30:14,280 --> 04:30:14,400
Okay.

5211
04:30:14,780 --> 04:30:15,360
This is it.

5212
04:30:17,540 --> 04:30:19,260
Reminds me of how Horse Girl...

5213
04:30:19,260 --> 04:30:19,600
What?

5214
04:30:23,620 --> 04:30:26,920
I wish we could've gotten like one more day to train.

5215
04:30:28,120 --> 04:30:28,900
You know?

5216
04:30:33,120 --> 04:30:34,320
Four times it?

5217
04:30:34,400 --> 04:30:34,580
Okay.

5218
04:30:34,580 --> 04:30:36,080
Well, four times it.

5219
04:30:46,500 --> 04:30:49,540
I guess I could've changed... I forgot about changing the strategy.

5220
04:30:50,620 --> 04:30:52,580
Oh wait, how do I change it to four times?

5221
04:30:52,580 --> 04:30:53,540
I think I got the best.

5222
04:30:54,340 --> 04:30:55,340
The next one.

5223
04:30:57,220 --> 04:30:58,260
I'm going to buy with this.

5224
04:30:58,260 --> 04:30:58,700
The last one.

5225
04:30:59,560 --> 04:31:01,840
I'm going to buy with this.

5226
04:31:03,060 --> 04:31:05,280
I'll give you one second.

5227
04:31:06,340 --> 04:31:08,100
Let's start with the two of them.

5228
04:31:10,420 --> 04:31:15,560
I'm going to buy the It'll be like...

5229
04:32:07,310 --> 04:32:09,470
Super Creek is way too strong.

5230
04:32:19,920 --> 04:32:22,040
How low is she that she is?

5231
04:32:23,960 --> 04:32:24,980
Ultra glue.

5232
04:32:25,780 --> 04:32:28,960
How bad did she do that her expression is like this?

5233
04:32:33,220 --> 04:32:35,760
She does worse and worse every time.

5234
04:32:35,980 --> 04:32:37,740
This is... this... it's over, it's so...

5235
04:32:37,740 --> 04:32:39,200
It's over, you guys!

5236
04:32:40,800 --> 04:32:42,940
It's so over, we did it even worse!

5237
04:32:47,900 --> 04:32:49,420
Go for seven.

5238
04:32:49,760 --> 04:32:55,080
I can't believe... she had the home stretch but didn't...

5239
04:33:00,900 --> 04:33:01,940
Change strategy.

5240
04:33:03,860 --> 04:33:04,720
One more!

5241
04:33:05,180 --> 04:33:06,720
Are we really gonna do this?

5242
04:33:06,840 --> 04:33:08,340
Okay, this is the last, last one.

5243
04:33:08,800 --> 04:33:09,860
Wait, so...

5244
04:33:12,840 --> 04:33:14,300
I don't think it'll work, though.

5245
04:33:18,100 --> 04:33:18,620
Late?

5246
04:33:19,100 --> 04:33:20,300
What does D mean?

5247
04:33:21,360 --> 04:33:22,360
Yeah, don't change.

5248
04:33:22,500 --> 04:33:24,260
I think pace is the best one we got.

5249
04:33:27,400 --> 04:33:27,920
Yeah...

5250
04:33:27,920 --> 04:33:28,640
Um...

5251
04:33:28,640 --> 04:33:30,940
I think I shouldn't have redone this.

5252
04:33:31,140 --> 04:33:31,760
I think...

5253
04:33:31,760 --> 04:33:33,700
I think I shouldn't have given up.

5254
04:33:40,910 --> 04:33:43,610
I'll try front just cause we are here.

5255
04:33:43,830 --> 04:33:44,990
And we can try it.

5256
04:33:45,170 --> 04:33:46,290
But I don't think it's gonna work.

5257
04:33:47,210 --> 04:33:48,030
We'll see.

5258
04:33:50,790 --> 04:33:52,230
We're just testing it.

5259
04:33:52,530 --> 04:33:53,250
Who knows?

5260
04:33:53,690 --> 04:33:55,210
Maybe a miracle will happen.

5261
04:33:55,210 --> 04:33:55,530
Then...

5262
04:33:59,630 --> 04:34:00,470
I'll fall...

5263
04:34:00,470 --> 04:34:01,310
We'll...

5264
04:34:01,310 --> 04:34:02,750
Four times speed it again.

5265
04:34:06,030 --> 04:34:07,790
It just makes you feel so helpless.

5266
04:34:08,010 --> 04:34:08,710
When you're like...

5267
04:34:11,670 --> 04:34:12,110
When...

5268
04:34:12,110 --> 04:34:13,250
You are like...

5269
04:34:13,250 --> 04:34:13,470
Go!

5270
04:34:13,630 --> 04:34:13,730
Go!

5271
04:34:13,910 --> 04:34:16,050
And you just can't do anything to help them, ya know?

5272
04:34:19,690 --> 04:34:20,550
Look at her go.

5273
04:34:20,550 --> 04:34:23,450
If she can maintain the stamina, you know...

5274
04:34:23,450 --> 04:34:23,890
Oh?

5275
04:34:26,750 --> 04:34:27,250
Wait!

5276
04:34:28,550 --> 04:34:30,170
We just need to get top three!

5277
04:34:36,250 --> 04:34:37,130
Is she ult?

5278
04:34:40,050 --> 04:34:41,670
I think she can maintain it, maybe?

5279
04:34:42,610 --> 04:34:44,130
Oh, no, no, no.

5280
04:34:58,140 --> 04:34:59,800
She did it!

5281
04:35:00,240 --> 04:35:03,320
Is it seventh?

5282
04:35:03,680 --> 04:35:05,320
Is it seventh place?

5283
04:35:26,820 --> 04:35:28,700
Yeah, that's, uh...

5284
04:35:28,700 --> 04:35:29,100
Yeah, that's, uh...

5285
04:35:29,100 --> 04:35:30,640
We wanna watch the concert?

5286
04:35:35,230 --> 04:35:37,490
We said we would end on a concert, everybody.

5287
04:35:37,490 --> 04:35:39,570
And loving memory of Gloomikoyin.

5288
04:35:54,130 --> 04:35:54,890
Woo!

5289
04:35:55,470 --> 04:35:58,290
I've always loved Mejiro Ryan!

5290
04:36:02,070 --> 04:36:04,250
Is she even a background dancer?

5291
04:36:04,550 --> 04:36:05,270
I don't think so.

5292
04:36:22,350 --> 04:36:23,790
Oh, I think she might be in the rafters...

5293
04:36:35,410 --> 04:36:35,970
Oh,

5294
04:36:39,870 --> 04:36:40,470
there she is!

5295
04:36:44,190 --> 04:36:46,190
This too is the idol experience.

5296
04:36:49,730 --> 04:36:51,430
She's working the life.

5297
04:37:02,710 --> 04:37:03,690
Oh, there she is!

5298
04:37:19,420 --> 04:37:20,500
This song is great though.

5299
04:37:28,380 --> 04:37:29,800
Oh, there she is!

5300
04:37:33,300 --> 04:37:35,360
This is the idol experience too.

5301
04:37:39,280 --> 04:37:40,320
Where you're...

5302
04:37:40,320 --> 04:37:43,340
Well, she is just, you know, maybe sometimes...

5303
04:37:45,800 --> 04:37:48,400
Not even given the singing part.

5304
04:37:49,600 --> 04:37:50,120
But...

5305
04:37:52,540 --> 04:37:58,400
If we had gone with the concert when she got fourth place, she would have at least been on stage.

5306
04:38:05,460 --> 04:38:07,780
We didn't achieve our goals.

5307
04:38:10,440 --> 04:38:13,240
But that doesn't mean our dreams are ruined.

5308
04:38:13,860 --> 04:38:15,400
This feels like NTR!

5309
04:38:18,320 --> 04:38:18,720
No...

5310
04:38:21,040 --> 04:38:24,320
As her trainer, I'll be there to support her as long as she keeps on running.

5311
04:38:32,010 --> 04:38:32,490
Oh...

5312
04:38:32,490 --> 04:38:33,130
What

5313
04:38:39,010 --> 04:38:39,710
is complete...

5314
04:38:39,710 --> 04:38:42,250
Wait, so then I complete career and then she's done forever?

5315
04:38:42,350 --> 04:38:42,710
That's it?

5316
04:38:47,790 --> 04:38:51,590
Being forced to participate as a background dancer in a winner's concert has been...

5317
04:38:51,590 --> 04:38:54,650
Is that even more humiliating than blowing the race in the first place?

5318
04:38:56,710 --> 04:38:58,070
She becomes a vet!

5319
04:38:58,690 --> 04:38:59,670
Oh my god!

5320
04:39:00,890 --> 04:39:01,750
That's it!

5321
04:39:03,530 --> 04:39:05,430
I don't think we can get anything else.

5322
04:39:07,910 --> 04:39:08,770
She's...

5323
04:39:08,770 --> 04:39:09,430
She's...

5324
04:39:10,110 --> 04:39:10,230
She's dead!

5325
04:39:17,460 --> 04:39:20,920
She dies a 12th place winner...

5326
04:39:20,920 --> 04:39:21,400
Loser!

5327
04:39:23,200 --> 04:39:25,120
She dies in 12th...

5328
04:39:25,120 --> 04:39:26,500
You guys, she had fourth!

5329
04:39:27,370 --> 04:39:29,340
And then we said it was all a dream!

5330
04:39:33,270 --> 04:39:36,820
She had dreams of getting a higher spot!

5331
04:39:37,280 --> 04:39:39,040
Then was she...

5332
04:39:40,640 --> 04:39:42,500
Then what she actually achieved!

5333
04:39:46,590 --> 04:39:47,540
She's dead!

5334
04:39:48,680 --> 04:39:50,560
It's all...

5335
04:39:51,820 --> 04:39:53,000
Over...

5336
04:40:00,680 --> 04:40:02,190
D rank...

5337
04:40:09,590 --> 04:40:11,490
First in D!

5338
04:40:15,600 --> 04:40:16,960
Bye bye!

5339
04:40:18,060 --> 04:40:20,240
Bye bye, Majinobit Queen!

5340
04:40:23,200 --> 04:40:25,900
She'll be forever within you as Jelly...

5341
04:40:26,600 --> 04:40:27,040
Nice!

5342
04:40:29,940 --> 04:40:30,380
Nice!

5343
04:40:31,820 --> 04:40:32,260
Yeah!

5344
04:40:46,470 --> 04:40:48,010
It's like waking up from a dream...

5345
04:40:48,010 --> 04:40:49,590
To wake up from an even worse dream...

5346
04:40:49,590 --> 04:40:50,290
And then another dream!

5347
04:40:57,210 --> 04:40:57,650
Yeah...

5348
04:40:58,270 --> 04:40:58,710
Yeah...

5349
04:41:04,350 --> 04:41:05,870
Look at all this stuff we're getting though!

5350
04:41:06,950 --> 04:41:08,830
Watch the winning soul!

5351
04:41:09,210 --> 04:41:10,090
Watch the winning soul!

5352
04:41:12,710 --> 04:41:14,090
What's the up of Legendverse?

5353
04:41:14,530 --> 04:41:15,370
What's this?

5354
04:41:15,590 --> 04:41:15,790
Ooh!

5355
04:41:23,020 --> 04:41:25,340
Kinda wanna do another pen pull...

5356
04:41:27,920 --> 04:41:28,760
But...

5357
04:41:32,540 --> 04:41:33,480
What's this?

5358
04:41:37,400 --> 04:41:38,040
Achieve...

5359
04:41:38,040 --> 04:41:38,260
Ooh!

5360
04:41:39,300 --> 04:41:39,560
Wow!

5361
04:41:40,920 --> 04:41:42,100
Pull time...

5362
04:41:42,100 --> 04:41:42,600
And then we end!

5363
04:41:44,540 --> 04:41:45,920
I have new friends too!

5364
04:41:48,900 --> 04:41:50,180
What are the secrets?

5365
04:41:50,660 --> 04:41:51,580
Wait, what are the secrets?

5366
04:41:52,540 --> 04:41:54,020
I'm almost to a thousand!

5367
04:41:55,060 --> 04:41:56,020
Uh-huh...

5368
04:41:56,720 --> 04:41:58,940
Umamusume-tach-no-himits-ga-kin-nar-mas-ka?

5369
04:42:04,980 --> 04:42:05,460
Ah...

5370
04:42:06,140 --> 04:42:06,620
Secrets...

5371
04:42:06,620 --> 04:42:08,100
She sometimes shouts...

5372
04:42:08,100 --> 04:42:09,460
Bring em home in her sleep...

5373
04:42:09,460 --> 04:42:11,280
And wakes herself up...

5374
04:42:11,800 --> 04:42:14,040
That's what she had the migraine from...

5375
04:42:14,040 --> 04:42:16,000
She'll be the glue that holds our hearts together...

5376
04:42:26,550 --> 04:42:28,710
I feel like if I cut my hair...

5377
04:42:28,710 --> 04:42:29,410
I would look similar...

5378
04:42:29,410 --> 04:42:29,750
I would look similar...

5379
04:42:33,790 --> 04:42:35,570
She prefers bread for breakfast...

5380
04:42:36,630 --> 04:42:39,110
Sorry, I'm a rice gang...

5381
04:42:39,110 --> 04:42:39,890
I'm rice...

5382
04:42:39,890 --> 04:42:40,370
For brea...

5383
04:42:40,370 --> 04:42:41,150
I'm rice...

5384
04:42:41,150 --> 04:42:42,570
Over bread gang...

5385
04:42:43,930 --> 04:42:45,630
And I'm trying to find Top Gun...

5386
04:42:46,210 --> 04:42:46,550
Where is she?

5387
04:42:46,590 --> 04:42:47,190
Did I pass her?

5388
04:42:48,250 --> 04:42:48,810
You know...?

5389
04:42:51,950 --> 04:42:53,010
Oh, there she is...

5390
04:42:53,010 --> 04:42:53,250
You know.

5391
04:42:53,250 --> 04:42:54,410
No matter the paper...

5392
04:42:54,410 --> 04:42:57,190
She can always make an amazing paper airplane...

5393
04:42:59,970 --> 04:43:00,510
Hahahaha...

5394
04:43:02,630 --> 04:43:03,170
Good...

5395
04:43:05,650 --> 04:43:08,410
That's so funny...

5396
04:43:10,310 --> 04:43:10,850
Okay...

5397
04:43:10,850 --> 04:43:11,380
Just remember...

5398
04:43:11,710 --> 04:43:16,350
Now Now, sexy Seiya can hide in a box for tactical spin-off tactics.

5399
04:43:16,770 --> 04:43:17,010
Huh?

5400
04:43:19,030 --> 04:43:20,130
Wait, let me get up.

5401
04:43:20,690 --> 04:43:21,450
Oh, nice.

5402
04:43:25,170 --> 04:43:25,770
Scout.

5403
04:43:32,910 --> 04:43:34,550
Should I do a horse?

5404
04:43:35,470 --> 04:43:37,930
Should we try... wait...

5405
04:43:37,930 --> 04:43:39,190
Who was it that won?

5406
04:43:41,270 --> 04:43:43,250
It was, uh...

5407
04:43:45,390 --> 04:43:47,210
She was crazy, the creek.

5408
04:43:50,150 --> 04:43:51,590
Super creek.

5409
04:43:51,950 --> 04:43:53,010
She was crazy.

5410
04:43:56,330 --> 04:43:58,670
I went to pull for a horse.

5411
04:44:01,350 --> 04:44:02,630
Let's go.

5412
04:44:23,090 --> 04:44:24,650
Nice nature.

5413
04:44:25,310 --> 04:44:26,570
Grass wonder.

5414
04:44:27,810 --> 04:44:28,610
Ryan.

5415
04:44:38,170 --> 04:44:40,410
More Daiwa Scarlet.

5416
04:44:43,050 --> 04:44:44,190
More gold ship.

5417
04:44:46,210 --> 04:44:47,770
Um...well, that was a poll.

5418
04:44:51,630 --> 04:44:53,490
Acquire a total of 15 trainee.

5419
04:44:56,110 --> 04:44:57,350
Well, that was fun.

5420
04:44:57,790 --> 04:44:58,910
Thank you guys...

5421
04:44:58,910 --> 04:45:02,070
For telling me...teaching me all about Uma Musume and everything.

5422
04:45:03,350 --> 04:45:04,390
That was fun.

5423
04:45:07,330 --> 04:45:10,410
Umu Pyo-e was composed by the same person who composed MGS songs.

5424
04:45:10,410 --> 04:45:11,090
I know!

5425
04:45:11,610 --> 04:45:13,010
He did like Sins of the Father.

5426
04:45:13,250 --> 04:45:15,590
He still had a bunch of Metal Gear songs, actually.

5427
04:45:18,150 --> 04:45:19,330
Yes, yes, I know.

5428
04:45:20,650 --> 04:45:24,010
Still don't 100% get this game, but Minto Musume has been fun.

5429
04:45:25,230 --> 04:45:26,070
Thank you!

5430
04:45:27,390 --> 04:45:28,410
I see Nindin!

5431
04:45:30,390 --> 04:45:30,830
Yummy!

5432
04:45:31,310 --> 04:45:32,070
Give me carrots!

5433
04:45:32,370 --> 04:45:32,970
Give me carrots!

5434
04:45:33,190 --> 04:45:33,810
Give me carrots!

5435
04:45:36,750 --> 04:45:40,870
Yeah, the guy who composed Uma Pyo-e Densetsu used to work for Konami.

5436
04:45:41,550 --> 04:45:43,070
Now he works for side games.

5437
04:45:44,190 --> 04:45:45,090
Great first ride.

5438
04:45:45,250 --> 04:45:46,530
Hope you find your Uma-oshi.

5439
04:45:46,970 --> 04:45:49,670
It might end up being the one of the many who aren't in global yet.

5440
04:45:49,770 --> 04:45:50,630
True, true, true.

5441
04:45:51,530 --> 04:45:51,930
Panda!

5442
04:45:52,430 --> 04:45:54,010
Thank you for the 10 gift and thank you!

5443
04:45:55,310 --> 04:45:56,150
Thank you!

5444
04:45:56,250 --> 04:45:56,530
Thank you!

5445
04:45:56,530 --> 04:45:56,710
Thank you!

5446
04:45:56,730 --> 04:45:57,190
Thank you!

5447
04:45:57,470 --> 04:45:57,470
Thank you!

5448
04:45:57,590 --> 04:45:58,750
Carrots, carrots, carrots.

5449
04:46:00,810 --> 04:46:02,130
Try for the thank you!

5450
04:46:02,770 --> 04:46:06,190
Alright, well, it's been way longer than I expected to stream today.

5451
04:46:07,670 --> 04:46:11,790
Luckily, tomorrow's stream, I don't have to narrate anything because it's fully voiced.

5452
04:46:12,510 --> 04:46:13,150
Chiron-chan!

5453
04:46:13,590 --> 04:46:14,010
Thank you!

5454
04:46:15,610 --> 04:46:16,730
Thanks for the stream!

5455
04:46:17,050 --> 04:46:17,810
Thank you, thank you!

5456
04:46:17,890 --> 04:46:18,430
Here's your carrots.

5457
04:46:18,430 --> 04:46:19,170
Chiron-chan!

5458
04:46:22,430 --> 04:46:23,330
So...

5459
04:46:23,760 --> 04:46:24,970
This was a lot of fun.

5460
04:46:25,390 --> 04:46:27,030
Maybe we shout Uma again.

5461
04:46:28,090 --> 04:46:28,990
Maybe.

5462
04:46:31,150 --> 04:46:32,050
But...

5463
04:46:32,050 --> 04:46:33,190
Otsumito, everybody!

5464
04:46:33,610 --> 04:46:35,610
We fought...

5465
04:46:35,610 --> 04:46:36,750
Very hard.

5466
04:46:37,090 --> 04:46:38,650
It was a valiant effort.

5467
04:46:41,250 --> 04:46:42,150
And...

5468
04:46:42,150 --> 04:46:45,870
Everyone raise your glue glass...

5469
04:46:45,870 --> 04:46:47,350
And chug.

5470
04:46:49,150 --> 04:46:49,610
I

5471
04:46:56,740 --> 04:46:57,960
thank you guys for the stream!

5472
04:46:58,420 --> 04:46:58,880
See you!

5473
04:46:59,140 --> 04:46:59,500
Bye bye!
