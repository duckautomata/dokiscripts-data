1
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,780
Haiii...

2
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,420
Welcome back, lady!

3
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,040
Hello!

4
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
Welcome...

5
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,020
to...

6
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,580
Metal Gear Solid...

7
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,500
3!

8
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,080
Yippee!

9
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,780
My voice is like...

10
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,040
I did karaoke yesterday and my voice is kind of dead so...

11
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,620
Whoopsie!

12
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,380
Whoopsie!

13
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
Thank you for the pink!

14
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,380
Thank you!

15
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,360
Oh, save the line, boss.

16
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,040
Kept you waiting, huh?

17
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,280
Yay!

18
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,460
So, um...

19
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,340
Yeah!

20
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,540
Oh my gosh!

21
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh my gosh!

22
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,260
Wait, can you guys hear it?

23
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,980
Just so... I can never remember what you guys can... if you guys can hear it or not.

24
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,420
No?

25
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,400
Okay, now you'll be able to hear it.

26
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
Now you'll be able to hear it.

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,720
Thank you for using my remix!

28
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,040
Thank you, Rob!

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,340
Thanks for the remix!

30
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,960
Sorry, I just kind of stole your video.

31
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,420
Sorry, I just kind of...

32
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,620
took it for my own.

33
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
But I hope you don't mind.

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,880
I was like, gonna use just the audio, but then I was like, the whole video is kind of cool.

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,300
I was like, I kind of...

36
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
I want like the... I want your credit on the screen, you know?

37
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,460
So...

38
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,480
Haven't been able to play any of the Metal Gear games myself, so being able to experience the games for the first time with my Kamiyoshi...

39
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,280
Let's go!

40
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,900
Oh my gosh.

41
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,640
So...

42
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,500
I'll be honest.

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,200
You know, with Metal Gear Solid 1 and Metal Gear Solid 2, I've kind of like...

44
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,400
touched them again, I guess?

45
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,360
Since the first time I played it.

46
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,900
But actually, with Metal Gear Solid 3...

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,880
I have not really played this since the first time I played it.

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,500
So, I've been very nervous about this game in particular.

49
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,180
Replaying it again.

50
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,400
So, I'm just like...

51
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,020
That's not to say...

52
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,440
That's not to say I haven't watched other people play it.

53
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Because there's like a 24-hour Metal Gear livestream thing that I just kind of have on in the background a lot of my days.

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,620
What about the 3DS version?

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:11,920
Oh!

56
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,600
I played the 3DS version.

57
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,980
Um...

58
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,440
Of Metal Gear Solid 3.

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,100
Up to like...

60
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,640
Sokolov.

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,720
So, I didn't get very far.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,000
Like, I didn't even get to...

63
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,160
Operation Snake Eater.

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,620
I just kind of...

65
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,860
I just kind of...

66
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,640
Oh!

67
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,420
Snake Eater!

68
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,900
Snake Eater!

69
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,940
I...

70
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,780
I...

71
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,340
I...

72
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,040
It's...

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,100
I did not...

74
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,680
I just did not like playing it on such a small screen.

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,620
It's basically it, you know?

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
Is that Subsistence?

77
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,100
Yes!

78
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,100
So, today we will be playing the Subsistence version.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,560
I've got my Playstation...

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,360
My PS2...

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,760
All set up...

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,260
For this.

83
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,300
So...

84
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:02,900
Um...

85
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,780
Yeah, I am playing Subsistence.

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,120
So, there will be a few little differences...

87
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,280
Between...

88
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,860
Um...

89
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,380
Like the HD collection and this as well.

90
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,220
And...

91
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,460
If you are curious...

92
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,180
Yes, it does have that...

93
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,860
Dream sequence in it.

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,380
So...

95
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,280
And...

96
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:28,540
The...

97
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,820
What's interesting to me too is...

98
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,140
In this, you can switch between like...

99
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,640
The original Metal Gear Solid 3 camera...

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
And then the...

101
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:37,900
Updated...

102
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,540
Subsistence one.

103
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,580
So, yeah.

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,320
I mean those sad podcast over happy you're back.

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
Thank you.

106
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,780
Actually, well, there's still...

107
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,920
Two episodes left of the podcast.

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,600
Well, technically one episode and then one...

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Bonus thing.

110
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,960
So...

111
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,400
Thanks to the five gifters.

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,420
This ghost is looking kind of funky.

113
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

114
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,250
But, yeah.

115
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,490
So...

116
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,350
Um...

117
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,670
Just wanted to say thank you.

118
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,790
I'm just gonna kind of go for it.

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,910
And...

120
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,950
Um...

121
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,630
Today...

122
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:20,970
Uh...

123
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,010
I'll be honest.

124
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,750
Still fighting that jet lag.

125
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,990
So bad.

126
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,190
I'm not sure how far we'll get.

127
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,270
Um...

128
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,450
Definitely through...

129
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,090
Like...

130
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,710
At least...

131
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,030
You know...

132
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,750
Virtuous mission.

133
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,390
Which is not very long at all.

134
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,450
But...

135
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,070
Um...

136
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,930
I mean...

137
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,070
Sorry.

138
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,810
Virtual mission.

139
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:41,930
And...

140
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,570
Um...

141
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,130
Um...

142
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,930
Um...

143
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,650
Um...

144
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,770
Like...

145
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,110
How long did you sleep for?

146
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,690
Oh my gosh.

147
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,330
I went to bed last night at like 3 a.m.

148
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,070
And then I woke up at my...

149
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,630
Like naturally I woke up at like 6 a.m.

150
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,530
And then...

151
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,990
I couldn't get back to sleep.

152
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,090
And then...

153
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,850
I took a nap about like two hours ago.

154
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,830
For like an hour.

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,910
So...

156
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,050
My...

157
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,110
My...

158
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,950
My...

159
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,470
My...

160
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,970
My brain is just waking me up so early for some reason.

161
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,690
This is so annoying.

162
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,910
Jet lagged the secret member of the cover unit.

163
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,930
But I have some coffee here.

164
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,570
I have some...

165
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,490
Canned coffee.

166
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,810
And yeah.

167
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,790
I'm ready baby.

168
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,990
I think it's because...

169
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,310
When I was in Japan...

170
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:37,830
I mean...

171
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,330
To be fair...

172
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,270
I was there for a whole month.

173
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,690
So...

174
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,350
You know...

175
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,330
My soul really adjusted while I was there.

176
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,830
But...

177
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,230
I also didn't drink so much caffeine while I was over there.

178
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:53,090
And now I'm drinking caffeine to make myself like awake and excitable for stream.

179
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,310
So...

180
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,010
You know how it is.

181
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,290
I mean to I'm alive.

182
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,730
Saku!

183
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,390
I put in a request to have my relocation delayed till after Christmas.

184
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,410
I hope that works.

185
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,430
Detox blues.

186
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,030
Thank you!

187
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,610
You're awesome!

188
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,050
Thank you!

189
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:13,950
Thank you!

190
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,970
What's this!

191
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,790
What is this!

192
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,250
What in the world is this!

193
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,110
Less caffeine but there's tea everywhere.

194
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,710
But I drink a lot of tea.

195
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,970
When I'm at my maid cafe.

196
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,130
Like I am constantly drinking tea.

197
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,250
And because in Japan...

198
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,070
I drink like...

199
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,610
A lot of, um...

200
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,470
Especially because it was so hot.

201
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,010
I would drink a lot of vitamin drinks.

202
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,310
I would drink a lot of tomato juice.

203
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,670
I would drink a lot of fr diary sweat and stuff like that.

204
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,150
So.

205
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,770
It wasn't...

206
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:43,950
I just...

207
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,090
Mostly tea, that I was drinking.

208
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,630
MGS3, you'll probably like this one.

209
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,270
We'll see.

210
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,570
I'm going in with an open mind.

211
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,330
I'm going in with an open mind.

212
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,490
So yeah.

213
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,710
So yeah.

214
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,890
Let's begin, I suppose.

215
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,710
Here we

216
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,400
go.

217
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,160
Shino, thanks for the 20 gifted.

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
Oh, just kidding.

219
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,940
Now I press start.

220
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,060
New game.

221
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,850
I should say I like MGS2.

222
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,270
But it's true.

223
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,710
I do like MGS2.

224
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,350
I'm playing the MGS series for the first time.

225
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,530
Be honest.

226
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,130
I do.

227
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,190
I like MGS2.

228
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,330
Normal.

229
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,450
After the end of World War 2, the world was split into two.

230
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,990
East and West.

231
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,270
This marked the beginning of the era called the Cold War.

232
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,150
Oh gosh.

233
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,830
I'm not normal.

234
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,690
I'm not normal at all.

235
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,270
Oh god.

236
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh no.

237
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,880
I just hear his voice.

238
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh my gosh.

239
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,900
I've met so many of these people now.

240
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,160
Which is so insane to think about.

241
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,200
Oh my gosh.

242
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,480
I've met so many of these people now.

243
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,980
I've met...

244
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,440
Actually...

245
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,780
I'm going to be adjusting the audio.

246
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,540
I've got to intervene.

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,080
Oh, I'm getting ready to...

248
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,220
It was that guy called...

249
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:33,800
Okay.

250
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,220
At the beginning, I...

251
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:35,340
yeah.

252
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,000
I was...

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,160
Oh...

254
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,480
I think he went to the second floor.

255
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,640
Yes.

256
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,220
I completely forgot.

257
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,300
I know I just picked it, but I completely forgot that he has it on right now too.

258
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,620
Does this panty waste know what he's doing?

259
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,900
Panty waste.

260
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,880
Approaching release point.

261
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,900
10 minutes to drop off.

262
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,300
Hey, are you deaf?

263
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,100
He said put out the cigar and put on your mask.

264
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,180
Hey, that's no that's no way to talk to a hero.

265
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,380
A legend.

266
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,840
Of panty waste.

267
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,720
Yeah, I'd call Ryde in that too.

268
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,900
Decrystallization complete.

269
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,680
Checking oxygen supply.

270
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,960
Six minutes to drop off.

271
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,820
Opening rear hatch.

272
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm really... I really wanted to get back on this too as soon as I got back from Japan too because...

273
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,520
Sunrise.

274
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,920
Delta soon?

275
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,850
External temperature minus 46 degrees Celsius.

276
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,750
Two minutes to drop off.

277
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,530
Delta eventually.

278
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,230
No, Delta demo soon.

279
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,510
For me?

280
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:58,970
Hopefully.

281
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,930
Try not to get frostbite from the wind chill.

282
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,530
Hopefully.

283
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,310
One minute to drop off.

284
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,210
Move to the rear.

285
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,850
What'd you say about my rear?

286
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,450
This is one for the history books.

287
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,490
The world's first halo jump.

288
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,810
Oh my gosh, the world's first halo jump!

289
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,450
10 seconds to drop off.

290
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,270
Standby.

291
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,650
Status okay?

292
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,670
All green.

293
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,370
All green.

294
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,930
Prepare for drop off.

295
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,270
Do a flip.

296
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,830
spread your wings and fly.

297
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,090
I hope they redub that part where he says, do a flip instead.

298
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,460
NOOOOOOOOoo.

299
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:41,820
See?

300
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,460
he's listening.

301
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
He listens to me.

302
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,580
He's not spreading any wings.

303
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,420
He's flipping around..

304
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,380
This is the game based on the pachinko machine?

305
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,140
Yeah.

306
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,840
Jack, I've got some important news.

307
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,880
The head of the CIA has finally given us the green light for the Virtuous Mission.

308
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,940
Virtual Mission?

309
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,440
No, the Virtuous Mission.

310
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,780
The future of our FOX unit depends on it.

311
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,500
If it succeeds, we'll be officially organized into a unit.

312
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,120
Virtuous Mission?

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,260
Sounds like some kind of initiation ritual.

314
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
Don't get cocky, this isn't a training op.

315
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,100
Right.

316
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,440
So what exactly is this wonderful mission?

317
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,420
This wonderful mission...

318
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:37,540
About two years ago, a certain Soviet scientist requested asylum in the West through one of our...

319
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,140
So crunchy!

320
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,140
His name is Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov.

321
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,080
He's head of the OKB-754 Design Bureau.

322
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,980
He has a middle name!

323
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,940
I just always call him Sokolov.

324
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Sokolov?

325
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,880
I never even think about his whole name.

326
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,720
And the East's foremost expert on weapons development.

327
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,560
Sokolov?

328
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,480
Isn't he that famous rocket scientist?

329
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,600
The very same.

330
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,420
What is this?

331
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,160
On April 12, 1961, the Soviets achieved the first manned spaceflight in history.

332
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,640
The Earth was blue, but there was no God.

333
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,380
Well spoken.

334
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,260
The rocket that carried Yuri Gagarin to orbit was the A-1, known as the Vostok rocket.

335
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,860
Snake just pulling anything out of his...

336
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,180
Sokolov is said to be the man...

337
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,920
most responsible for the multi-engine cluster used in that rocket.

338
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,780
Not major being like...

339
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:31,680
After Gagarin's flight, Sokolov left rocket development to become the head of the newly established design bureau.

340
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,900
From a lowly technician to head of a design bureau, that's quite a success story.

341
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,040
So why'd he want to defect?

342
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,080
It seems he'd become afraid of his own creations.

343
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,020
Afraid?

344
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,940
As they all do.

345
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,280
Call it a crisis of conscience.

346
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,700
And for that, he left his country and his family behind...

347
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,520
and went over the fence.

348
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,780
Not exactly.

349
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,880
One of his conditions was that his family was also to be taken safely to the west.

350
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,840
We used a mole to get the family out first...

351
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,340
and succeeded in sneaking Sokolov over the Berlin Wall shortly afterwards.

352
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
I was the one who conducted the operation.

353
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,960
Okay, what do you want?

354
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,120
A medal?

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
You want a pat on your back?

356
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,860
Shut up, Major.

357
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,900
A cookie?

358
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:23,540
It took him two weeks and more than 600 miles to get from the research facility in the Soviet Union to Berlin.

359
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,860
He was in no condition to say anything coherent.

360
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,220
Oh my gosh.

361
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,920
And it was only a week later that we had something much bigger on our mind.

362
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,600
Real people!

363
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,000
The Cuban Missile Crisis.

364
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,680
Crisis!

365
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,940
On October 16, 1962, President Kennedy received word that the Soviets were in the process of deploying...

366
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,340
Oh my god!

367
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,360
...intermediate-range ballistic missiles from Cuba.

368
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,860
JFK!

369
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,420
He demanded that the Soviets dismantle and remove the missiles.

370
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,780
At the same time, he announced a naval blockade to prevent further missile shipments from reaching Cuba.

371
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,020
But the Soviets didn't back down, instead placing their armed forces on secondary alert.

372
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,880
Soviet transport ships carrying missiles continued on course towards Cuba.

373
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,400
They're so angry.

374
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:04,940
U.S.

375
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,720
and Soviet forces went on alert for an all-out nuclear war.

376
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
Frantic negotiations were conducted...

377
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,860
Real people!

378
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,440
...through the U.N.'s Emergency Security Council and unofficial channels to end the hair-trigger standoff.

379
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,960
Finally, on October 28, the Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba.

380
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,140
What would these leaders think of all this footage being used in a video game?

381
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,660
And so the world avoided a nuclear holocaust.

382
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,620
What would these world leaders think?

383
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,140
But in order to get the Soviets to pull their missiles out, we had to make a deal.

384
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,120
You mean the one where the U.S.

385
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,300
agreed to remove its IRBMs from Turkey?

386
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:35,900
No.

387
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,280
The Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Turkey were obsolete, and we were going to get rid of them anyway.

388
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,240
Yeah, they'd be like, what's a video game?

389
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,760
They'd be like, what's a video game?

390
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,400
The Turkey deal was a ruse.

391
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,680
A ruse?

392
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,360
A cover story was fed to the other intelligence agencies around the world.

393
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,040
So what did the Russians really want?

394
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,400
Sokolov.

395
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
They wanted us to return to Sokolov.

396
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
They want him.

397
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,760
You mean the Soviets pulled out of Cuba just to get their hands on Sokolov?

398
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,120
Sokolov.

399
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,220
That's right.

400
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,980
What the hell was he working on?

401
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,740
At the time, we had no idea.

402
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,980
Because he was getting my past high school history.

403
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,740
We were running out of time.

404
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,400
It was either give up Sokolov or risk full-scale nuclear war.

405
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,460
Understandable.

406
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,120
In the end, we had no choice.

407
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,580
President Kennedy gave in to Khrushchev's demand.

408
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,720
The next day, I got Sokolov out of the hospital.

409
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,740
Handing him over to agents on the eastern side.

410
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,180
He looks like he's like stumbling over.

411
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,160
Sokolov kept on screaming, save me, until he disappeared from my sight.

412
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,740
I can't even tell what's going on in this picture.

413
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,000
Then a month ago, we received some new information from one of our moles.

414
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,200
Who took that?

415
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,020
You need to fire them.

416
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,180
About Sokolov?

417
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,080
Yes.

418
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:52,460
He was taken back to the research facility and forced to continue working on the weapon in question under KGB supervision.

419
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,560
Bigfoot camera work.

420
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,260
I didn't take that picture.

421
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,100
So what kind of weapon is it?

422
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,780
Something to do with space rockets?

423
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,260
Space rockets?

424
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:01,620
No, missiles.

425
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,900
Missiles.

426
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,660
Same technology.

427
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,280
I guess you're right.

428
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,580
We don't know the details, but it appears to be a new kind of nuclear device.

429
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:09,940
Oh.

430
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,940
For half a year now, the Soviets have been conducting frequent nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk.

431
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,180
Some kind of nuclear device?

432
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,920
We're talking about a secret weapon so big that Khrushchev was ready to pull out of Cuba to get it back.

433
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,360
Is Sokolov still in the facility?

434
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,360
No.

435
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,360
According to our intelligence, he's in Selenoyarsk, a place in the mountains about three miles to the west that's known as the Virgin Cliffs.

436
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,120
The Virgin Cliffs?

437
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,340
Don't say it like that.

438
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,220
That's mean for a virtuous mission.

439
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,460
They moved him there just recently.

440
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,360
Why?

441
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,700
This man.

442
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,200
Apparently, they're conducting a field test of the weapon, but it's our best chance to get him back.

443
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,180
The Virgin Cliffs.

444
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,960
This mission would never have been possible if he was still in the research facility.

445
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,580
This is our last chance.

446
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,400
Sokolov must have known that too when he contacted us.

447
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,720
Snake you dog.

448
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,030
He's like, I can make them the not Virgin Cliffs.

449
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,390
I can make them the un... I can...

450
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,270
Keep

451
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,110
the Cliffs away from Steg.

452
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,350
The Cliffs are in danger!

453
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,790
We'd have to update all the maps!

454
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,570
Don't let him do it!

455
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,430
It's a pain in the neck!

456
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,770
It's a pain in the neck!

457
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,330
I'll have you...

458
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:41,850
I'll have you...

459
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,270
I'll have you...

460
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,030
I'll have you...

461
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,730
I'll have you...

462
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,710
I'll have you...

463
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,330
I'll have you...

464
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:46,470
I'll have you...

465
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,830
This part's cooler, though, I think.

466
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,550
Seeing it from our vision.

467
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,670
If we don't get Sokolov back before that weapon is complete, we'll be facing a major crisis.

468
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,890
Ugh, crisis!

469
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,830
The clock is ticking.

470
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,180
Once we've confirmed the rescue of Sokolov, stand by at the recovery point.

471
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,660
A recovery balloon will be dropped at that point.

472
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,960
Helium will be pumped into the balloon to inflate it.

473
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,500
The process takes about 20 minutes.

474
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:16,820
Okay.

475
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,480
Once it's complete, the gunship's arm will latch onto the balloon and pull it up.

476
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,700
The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system.

477
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,540
I'm familiar with the theory.

478
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,180
Take it easy.

479
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,820
It's been combat proven.

480
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Do you think Sokolov is up to it?

481
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,900
The shock will be less than during a parachute jump, and the arm can handle up to 500 pounds.

482
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,180
Yay, Fulton!

483
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,420
So you're planning on going over the border in a single combat talent?

484
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,260
...

485
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,880
...

486
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:46,800
...

487
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,300
She's equipped with two six-barrel 20mm Vulcan cannons, as well as two 40mm machine guns.

488
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,700
Oh, okay.

489
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,860
Sounds like she could hold her own against a battalion of tanks.

490
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,200
Even with the fuel in the reserve tank, we're facing a four-hour time limit.

491
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,200
If all goes well, it shouldn't take more than a few hours.

492
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,560
Home in time for dinner.

493
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,700
But if anything goes wrong...

494
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,120
You'll be eating dinner, breakfast, and all the rest of your meals in the jungle.

495
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,540
No!

496
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,800
He's probably okay with that.

497
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,500
We know what Snake likes.

498
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
He wants some more.

499
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,980
Boss, when are you going to do a Halo jump?

500
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:30,940
Uhhh...

501
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,640
Uhhh...

502
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,360
Uhhh...

503
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,420
Uhhh...

504
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:36,560
Uhhh...

505
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:36,660
Uhhh...

506
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,040
Uhhh...

507
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,140
Uhhh...

508
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,200
Uhhh...

509
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,400
Uhhh...

510
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,520
Uhhh...

511
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,580
, so...never.

512
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,900
Woah!

513
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,900
Woah!

514
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:54,740
Hehehe.

515
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,210
Woah...

516
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,730
And now...

517
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,590
And now...

518
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,850
I knew it was coming, but it's still so jarring.

519
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,150
Why do I have to do that?

520
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,750
And now...

521
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,250
Woah...

522
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,370
The jungles of Russia.

523
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,630
And now...

524
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,710
And now...

525
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,210
Russia!

526
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,820
Who is that?

527
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,640
Oh my gosh!

528
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,800
That silver hair...

529
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,000
That stance!

530
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,640
Those big, big thighs!

531
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,220
It's Raiden!

532
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,680
Jack!

533
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,700
Jack is back, baby!

534
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,320
Oh my gosh!

535
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,540
Oh my gosh!

536
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,420
I'm playing Metal Gear Solid 3 again.

537
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,680
I hear some rustling.

538
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,980
I think I hear some...

539
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,880
SOME WILDLIFE!

540
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,420
Look, we got our calorie maze!

541
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,200
It's baby girl Raiden.

542
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,400
A balanced nutrition food.

543
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,440
Nice!

544
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh!

545
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,680
What's down here?

546
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,480
What do you think it is?

547
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,720
It's...

548
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,340
It's...

549
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,640
A frog!

550
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:36,980
Yippee!

551
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,650
Cut

552
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,350
the grass!

553
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,150
Cut the grass!

554
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,130
Let's go get our bag, I suppose.

555
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,970
So, if I press...

556
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,910
I think it's the right analog stick.

557
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:57,950
Look!

558
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,510
This...

559
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,030
Oh my gosh!

560
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,250
This is original Metal Gear Solid 3 camera.

561
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,590
Hello!

562
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,130
Do you copy?

563
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,270
You're already in enemy territory.

564
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,870
Somebody might be listening in.

565
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,530
From here on out, we'll be using code names to refer to each other.

566
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,870
Your code name for this mission will be Naked Snake.

567
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,610
I'll be referring to you as Snake from now on.

568
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,750
You're not to mention your real name.

569
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,830
Snake!

570
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,690
But you don't like snakes?

571
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,030
What do you mean?

572
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,290
You've eaten one before, haven't you?

573
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,610
In survival training.

574
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,170
I'm glad to hear that.

575
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,090
I don't know if I'd ever order one in a restaurant, but...

576
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,630
Be careful.

577
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,870
You might not have a choice.

578
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,970
He's gonna have an affinity.

579
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,690
What should I call you?

580
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,030
Let's see.

581
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,990
I'll be...

582
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,450
I'll be Tom.

583
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,030
Call me Major Tom.

584
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,090
Oh, and Snake?

585
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,890
The crew isn't watching anymore.

586
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,570
You can take off the disguise now.

587
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,650
Good idea.

588
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,830
This isn't right.

589
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,010
Time for the snake to shed his skin.

590
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,770
Oh my gosh.

591
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,690
I'm so excited.

592
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,330
Oh my gosh!

593
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,020
Oh my gosh!

594
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,140
Oh my god!

595
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,580
Jungles of Russia, jungles of...

596
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,220
The way he's looking around.

597
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,970
He's taking it all in.

598
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,290
Yeah, we gotta get our bag first.

599
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,390
We gotta get our bag first.

600
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,990
Oh my god, this clunky codec.

601
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,710
It's the boy!

602
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,370
There's our man!

603
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,210
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

604
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,610
This is Snake.

605
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,510
It's Plisky.

606
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,490
This will be a sneaky mission.

607
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,990
You must not be seen by the enemy.

608
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,210
You must leave no trace of your presence.

609
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,310
Is that clear?

610
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,950
This kind of infiltration is the Fox Unit's speciality.

611
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:14,870
Speciality?

612
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,750
In other words, weapons and equipment are procured on site.

613
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,550
That goes for food as well.

614
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,250
You're completely naked, just as your name implies.

615
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,190
Great.

616
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,890
Now I see why you asked me if I like snakes.

617
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,370
I suppose calling me Snake was your idea of a joke too.

618
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,210
I suppose calling me Snake was your idea of a joke too.

619
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,550
I'll tell you later when the time is right.

620
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,330
Gotcha.

621
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,250
Does he never tell us?

622
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,990
How exactly am I supposed to feed myself?

623
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,710
You've been issued a knife and a tranquilizer gun.

624
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,210
Use them to hunt for food.

625
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,790
You'll also find some medical supplies in your backpack.

626
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,910
Yeah, but...

627
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,510
Not the backpack.

628
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,990
I lost it in a tree on the way down.

629
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,350
I see.

630
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,590
Well, you'd better go back and get it then.

631
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,410
I remember...

632
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,850
No problem.

633
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,290
I can see it from here.

634
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,990
It's stuck on a branch.

635
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,670
Kojima said that snake just sounded cool.

636
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,630
Solid snake.

637
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,690
To climb a tree, stand in front of a tree that's covered in ivy and press the action button.

638
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,930
I'll be monitoring your progress over the radio.

639
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,870
We can't risk violating Soviet airspace, but I'll be in the gunship.

640
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:18,970
I think he says Y in the codec.

641
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,790
We'll just have to hear it again.

642
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,210
My frequency is one four zero point eight five.

643
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,690
I'll give you a call if I need to talk to you.

644
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,910
One four zero point eight five.

645
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,470
If you need to talk to me, use the send function.

646
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:29,910
Send.

647
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,050
Okay, snake.

648
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,370
Go get your backpack.

649
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:33,490
Okay.

650
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,790
I'm going to school.

651
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,930
Can't wait for flaccid snake.

652
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,130
No, don't say that.

653
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,450
Is he already in?

654
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,830
Okay, good.

655
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,310
Oh.

656
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,350
Snake, first you need to find that backpack you lost on the way down.

657
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:51,650
Okay.

658
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,550
Your backpack got caught on a tree to the north.

659
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,210
Try heading in that direction.

660
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,370
Okay, bye.

661
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:00,670
Okay.

662
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:02,650
Cool.

663
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,070
Okay, I already...

664
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,790
The camera angle for the original...

665
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,470
Like, it's like this.

666
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,550
Which I can see being useful.

667
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,130
Maybe sometimes.

668
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,530
But like...

669
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,650
It's...

670
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,270
This is just...

671
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,470
This is this.

672
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,430
And let's see.

673
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,690
We got our food.

674
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,310
Oh, we only have our food.

675
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,170
Calorie mate.

676
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,630
Tree frog.

677
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,150
We'll save this for later.

678
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,150
Nothing in the cage.

679
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,770
Because, you know...

680
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,870
Some days you might feed on a tree frog.

681
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,270
And...

682
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,370
This might be one of those days.

683
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,360
There's so much rustling.

684
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,920
There's so much rustling.

685
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,820
Oh, gosh!

686
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,300
It's a...

687
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,240
Maybe a reticulated python!

688
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,840
Our snake!

689
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,680
There's my bag.

690
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,820
Okay.

691
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
Look at...

692
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,200
Look at this...

693
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,580
Look at this T...

694
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,460
I can't even say the name!

695
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,780
Oh, my gosh!

696
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Look at this...

697
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,060
Look at this T-Rex pose!

698
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,280
Get up there.

699
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Okay, easy.

700
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,040
Easy.

701
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,140
Breezy.

702
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,940
Breezy.

703
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,700
Beautiful.

704
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,060
Cover girl.

705
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,280
I see you've retrieved your backpack, snake.

706
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:11,920
Yeah.

707
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,540
To equip a weapon, it's necessary to take it out of your backpack.

708
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,540
In the survival viewer, choose weapon from the backpack.

709
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,700
Your available weapons will be displayed in a window in the upper left.

710
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,340
From that list, choose the weapon you want to equip and press the enter button.

711
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,260
For other equipped items, just do the same thing from item.

712
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,100
Got it.

713
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Use the survival viewer backpack.

714
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,300
Backpack.

715
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,020
Yep, that's right.

716
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,080
Survival is fundamental to this mission.

717
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,180
After you've been out in the field for a while, your stamina will start to drop.

718
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,400
If your stamina gets too low, it'll affect your performance.

719
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,780
I think there's gonna be more than that.

720
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,360
And your wounds won't heal as smoothly.

721
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,700
There's gonna be way more of this affecting my performance.

722
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,240
Keep an eye on your stamina so you don't run out.

723
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,380
To recover lost stamina, you can hunt for local flora and fauna.

724
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,260
Flora?

725
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,140
You can use either your tranquilizer gun or your knife to hunt.

726
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,480
My only weapon is a Mark 22 hush puppy tranquilizer gun?

727
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,760
That's right.

728
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,700
It's been fitted with its own suppressor.

729
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,180
Oh my gosh.

730
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,200
However, the suppressor will deteriorate every time you fire.

731
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,560
Once its durability reaches zero, the noise suppression effect will be gone.

732
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,380
So don't get too trigger-happy with it.

733
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,220
The suppressor's durability is shown in the icon.

734
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,460
It's okay, I'll just CQC them.

735
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,400
Any weapons and equipment beyond what you're carrying now, you'll have to find as you go.

736
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,120
Okay.

737
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I have to find my own weapons and equipment?

738
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,420
Whose crazy idea was this, anyway?

739
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,680
Solo covert actions are standard FOX operating procedure.

740
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,720
You can't leave any traces of your presence.

741
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,660
You can't leave any traces of your presence.

742
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,740
No weapons, equipment, footprints, sweat, or bodily waste.

743
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,200
No weapons, equipment, footprints, sweat, or bodily waste.

744
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,520
The same goes for bullets and cartridges, too.

745
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:49,980
The same goes for bullets and cartridges, too.

746
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,360
It would be really bad if we had to clean that up, you know?

747
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:55,660
It would be really bad if we had to clean that up, you know?

748
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,900
There aren't supposed to be any American soldiers in Russia.

749
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,800
It could spark an international incident.

750
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,600
It could spark an international incident.

751
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,240
You can't let anyone see you.

752
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,200
You can't let the enemy know you're there.

753
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,780
This is a stealth mission.

754
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,380
You're a ghost, Snake.

755
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,040
In every sense of the word.

756
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,500
There'll be no rescue if you're captured.

757
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,340
The military and US government will deny any involvement in the affair.

758
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:16,960
The military and US government will deny any involvement in the affair.

759
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,100
Then I'll just have to take care of myself, huh?

760
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,760
Then I'll just have to take care of myself, huh?

761
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,880
So, you've been given a fake death pill for that purpose.

762
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,240
In every sense of the word.

763
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,460
Fake death pill.

764
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,680
SIS guidelines stipulate that soldiers on covert ops like this one be issued a potassium cyanide capsule.

765
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,540
You're a ghost, Mint.

766
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,440
Tape it to your body so you can take it with you.

767
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,660
And Harry, you're a wizard.

768
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,220
How generous of you.

769
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,200
Use it if you're taken prisoner by the enemy.

770
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,200
It'll send you into a state of false death for a short time.

771
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,220
Yay, false death!

772
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,840
Who am I to be thinking that I'm really dead?

773
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,060
So, how do I come back to life?

774
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,800
Just take the revival pill.

775
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,640
How would I...

776
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,640
How would I take it, though?

777
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,160
That's the one.

778
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,320
But be careful.

779
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,920
If you remain in a state of false death for too long, nothing will be able to bring you back.

780
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,220
Remember that.

781
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,980
If I'm fake dead, how do I fake alive?

782
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,200
You said this was a solo mission, right?

783
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:04,940
Right.

784
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,360
I guess that means I can't count on any reinforcements.

785
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,240
Nope.

786
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,060
The mission rests entirely in your hands.

787
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,960
No reinforcements.

788
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,240
Relax.

789
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,200
There's a support team ready to back you up over the radio.

790
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:18,900
Relax.

791
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:18,900
There's a support team ready to back you up over the radio.

792
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:18,960
Who?

793
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:20,940
No.

794
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,860
Survival is of utmost importance.

795
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,160
The first member of the support team will be in charge of monitoring your physical condition.

796
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,140
Acting as a medic, so to speak.

797
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,100
As well as recording your mission data.

798
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,420
She's a member of FOX, as well.

799
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,580
How's the audio, by the way?

800
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,160
Just let me know if I need to turn it up or down.

801
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:37,740
She.

802
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,460
Hello, Snake.

803
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm Paramedic.

804
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,300
Nice to meet you.

805
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:42,840
Paramedic.

806
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
As in a medic who comes in by parachute.

807
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,260
Aren't you going to tell me your real name?

808
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,520
Are you going to tell me yours, Mr. Snake?

809
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,400
No, we're using code names.

810
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:50,920
My name, huh?

811
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,720
It's John Doe.

812
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,640
And they call you Jack, for short.

813
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,660
You're a regular Captain Nemo.

814
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,460
A name means nothing on the battlefield.

815
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,700
I guess he's also Captain Nemo.

816
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,380
After a week, no one has a name.

817
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,840
What's your name?

818
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,480
Jane Doe.

819
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,620
Very funny.

820
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,440
I wasn't joking, but I'll tell you my name only if you manage to make it back alive.

821
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,820
Oh my gosh.

822
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,700
She took his last name.

823
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,900
My frequency is 145.73.

824
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,560
She's also in charge of recording your mission data.

825
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,820
Whenever you want to save, send a message over the reserved save frequency.

826
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
140.96.

827
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,220
So saving lets me record my mission data.

828
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,400
That's right.

829
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,740
It also records the state of your health.

830
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,180
Good to know.

831
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,080
Good to know.

832
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,260
There's one more person I want to introduce you to, Snake.

833
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,000
Speaking of snakes, you remember the boss, don't you?

834
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,880
A legendary soldier and your mentor.

835
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,600
The boss?

836
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,040
Actually, it was the boss that got the DCI's authorization in the first place.

837
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,100
The name means nothing on the battlefields as the guy who just asked for her name true.

838
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:51,660
The name means nothing on the battlefields as the guy who just asked for her name true.

839
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,180
Bosses?

840
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,420
She also helped me plan this mission.

841
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,500
She and I were at SAS together.

842
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,960
Oh, I thought she and I were sassy.

843
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,140
How many years has it been?

844
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,180
Boss?

845
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,740
That's right.

846
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,760
It's me.

847
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Talk to me.

848
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,100
Let me hear your voice.

849
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,840
It's been five years.

850
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,940
She's kind of squeaking.

851
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,840
Oh my god, Snake.

852
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,600
You've lost weight.

853
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,360
You can tell just by the sound of my voice.

854
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,040
Of course I can.

855
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,700
I know all about you.

856
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,800
Really?

857
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,140
Well, I don't know anything about you.

858
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,480
What's that supposed to mean?

859
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,020
Why'd you disappear on me all of a sudden?

860
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,300
I was on a top secret mission.

861
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,360
You didn't need me anymore.

862
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,580
Oh my god, hearing the boss's voice...

863
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,120
But there were still so many things I wanted you to teach me.

864
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,100
No.

865
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,860
I taught you everything you needed to know about fighting techniques.

866
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,760
I taught you all I could.

867
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,780
The rest you needed to learn on your own.

868
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,760
Techniques, sure.

869
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,060
But what about how to think like a soldier?

870
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,160
How to think like a soldier?

871
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,760
I can't teach you that.

872
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,300
A soldier needs to be strong in spirit, body, and technique.

873
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,580
And the only thing you can learn from someone else is technique.

874
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,400
And the only thing you can learn from someone else is technique.

875
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,540
In fact, technique doesn't even matter.

876
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,620
What's most important is spirit.

877
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,220
Spirit and body are like two sides of a single coin.

878
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,580
They're the same thing.

879
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,780
I can't teach you how to think.

880
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,520
You'll just have to figure it out for yourself.

881
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,200
Listen to me, Jack.

882
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,680
Just because soldiers are on the same side right now doesn't mean they always will be.

883
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,820
Having personal feelings about your comrades is one of the worst sins you can commit.

884
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,660
Politics determine who you face on the battlefield.

885
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,340
And politics are a living thing.

886
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,700
They change along with the times.

887
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,760
Yesterday's good might be tomorrow's evil.

888
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,700
Is that why you abandoned me?

889
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,440
No.

890
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,260
It had nothing to do with you.

891
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,140
I already told you, Jack.

892
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,080
I was on a top secret mission.

893
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,480
A soldier has to follow whatever orders he's given.

894
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,760
It's not his place to question why.

895
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,400
But you're looking for a reason to fight.

896
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,820
You're a natural born fighter.

897
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,680
But you're not quite a soldier.

898
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,820
I got rookie's eyes.

899
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,800
A soldier is a political tool.

900
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,180
That's doubly true if he's a career soldier.

901
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,340
Right and wrong have no place in his mission.

902
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,640
He has no enemies and no friends.

903
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,640
Only the mission.

904
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,640
I'll let you out once the cuts seem to have run far.

905
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,840
You follow the orders you're given.

906
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,200
That's what being a soldier is.

907
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,980
I'll let you out.

908
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,180
I do whatever I have to to get the job done.

909
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,040
I don't think about politics.

910
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,340
That's not the same thing.

911
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,900
Sooner or later, your conscience is going to bother you.

912
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,040
In the end, you have to choose whether you're going to live as a soldier...

913
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,020
or just another man with a gun.

914
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,920
There's a saying in the orient.

915
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,780
Loyalty to the end.

916
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,300
Do you know what it means?

917
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,340
Being patriotic.

918
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,080
It means devoting yourself to your country.

919
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,540
I follow the president and the top brass.

920
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm ready to die for them if necessary.

921
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,100
I'll turn off my noise gate so you can hear her meowing.

922
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,260
The president and the top brass won't be there forever.

923
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,500
Once their terms are up, others will take their place.

924
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,560
I follow the will of the leader.

925
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,340
No matter who's in charge.

926
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,860
People aren't the ones who dictate the mission.

927
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,480
Then who does?

928
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,820
The times.

929
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,340
People's values change over time.

930
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,660
And so do the leaders of a country.

931
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,380
So there's no such thing as an enemy in absolute terms.

932
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,180
The enemies we fight are only enemies in relative terms.

933
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,360
Constantly changing with the times.

934
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,220
This is too much for Snake's tiny brain.

935
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,220
There's no point in believing in anything.

936
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,120
Even in those we love.

937
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,980
And that's the way a soldier's supposed to think?

938
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,320
The only thing we can believe in, with absolute certainty, is the mission, Jack.

939
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,760
Alright, but do me a favor.

940
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,980
What is it?

941
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,160
Call me Snake.

942
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,160
The way he looks up.

943
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,060
Your code name is Snake.

944
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,600
It suits you well.

945
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,860
That's right.

946
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,840
The legendary unit that the boss put together during World War II was a snake.

947
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,100
The Cobra Unit.

948
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,460
A group of heroes that brought the war to an end and saved the world.

949
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,240
As long as you've got a legendary hero backing you up, you'll be fine.

950
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,320
Isn't that right, Snake?

951
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,800
What are you doing, Hurley?

952
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,140
I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have with me.

953
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,840
Oh, and one more thing, boss.

954
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,320
Yes, boss?

955
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,940
It's good to hear your voice again.

956
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,840
Same here.

957
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,220
After all, who knows if either of us will make it out alive.

958
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,980
Snake, you are always best at urban warfare and infiltrating buildings.

959
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,620
But this is the jungle.

960
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,760
Survival is going to be key.

961
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,820
Those CQC techniques I taught you are sure to come in handy.

962
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,820
CQC!

963
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,540
CQC?

964
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,560
Close quarters combat, huh?

965
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,240
Yeah!

966
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,480
I've been in green berets for the past few years.

967
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,920
I'm probably pretty rusty.

968
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,760
Not to worry.

969
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,020
I'll be here to help you remember.

970
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,660
After all, this is your first actual survival mission.

971
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,860
I'll be supporting you over the radio.

972
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,320
Where are you, boss?

973
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,500
Next to the Major?

974
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,380
The boss is communicating with us by radio from aboard a Permit Class submarine in the Arctic Ocean.

975
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,880
My frequency is 141.80.

976
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,800
Why is she in...

977
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,080
Why is she there?

978
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,640
Gotcha.

979
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,080
Your mission is to retrieve Dr. Sokolov.

980
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,120
Dr. Sokolov is being held in an abandoned factory located to the north of your current position.

981
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,940
Avoid heavy combat and don't let anyone see you.

982
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,480
Don't forget that this is a stealth mission.

983
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:25,980
Yeah.

984
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,740
Stealth mission.

985
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,120
She's going to shout out Shadow Moses.

986
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:31,900
Yeah, obviously.

987
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,660
The boss goes where the boss wants him.

988
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,780
Snake, try to remember some of the basics of CQC.

989
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,220
Yeah!

990
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,100
Say it.

991
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,860
Say it.

992
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Commencing virtuous mission now.

993
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,060
No!

994
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,840
Yeah!

995
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,900
Alrighty.

996
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,560
Alrighty.

997
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,040
Pies decided to not talk anymore because she...

998
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,020
Come here, you stinky girl.

999
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,020
Hold on.

1000
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:09,960
My cat.

1001
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,280
Come here.

1002
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,580
She was being so squeaky.

1003
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,420
No, no, no, no!

1004
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,160
Don't attack that!

1005
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,360
Don't attack that.

1006
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,200
What are you doing?

1007
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,220
What are you doing, girl?

1008
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,640
Come here.

1009
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,900
Come here.

1010
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,140
Oh, she's like playing.

1011
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,660
She'll like run up to me and then she'll start playing with the toy.

1012
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,200
So she keeps getting distracted by the toy.

1013
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,620
And not coming to me and not meowing.

1014
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,940
Why are you looking at me?

1015
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,860
What are you doing?

1016
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,660
What are you doing, silly girl?

1017
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:35,980
Come here.

1018
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,100
Come here.

1019
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,260
Everybody wants to hear you.

1020
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,620
I'm moving my mic.

1021
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,220
Oh, yeah!

1022
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,940
That was a squeak.

1023
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,360
Yeah.

1024
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,880
Oh, I just...

1025
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,600
Oh my gosh, I just shocked her with my hand!

1026
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,180
Hold on!

1027
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,240
Oh no, she ran away!

1028
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,260
Okay, hold on.

1029
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,840
I'll be right back.

1030
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,500
I'm gonna let her out.

1031
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:21,940
Okie dokie.

1032
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,220
Okie dokie.

1033
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,120
Alright.

1034
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:26,860
Now...

1035
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,560
Commencing virtual mission now.

1036
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,500
Commencing virtual mission now.

1037
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,760
Kuwabara!

1038
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,580
Kuwabara!

1039
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,500
Not to my cat!

1040
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,910
I didn't mean to shoot that.

1041
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,510
My bad.

1042
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,270
Okay, we got our little mic.

1043
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:01,830
We got our knife.

1044
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,570
I saw...

1045
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,330
Oh, there he is.

1046
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,130
Ah!

1047
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,020
We gotta get a snack, you guys.

1048
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,960
We gotta get a good ol' snack.

1049
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,220
Oh!

1050
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,760
Since we have some stuff, let's call...

1051
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,240
We gotta call paramedic.

1052
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,540
We gotta call the boss.

1053
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,120
We gotta call people first, you know?

1054
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,000
I see you've captured a giant anaconda.

1055
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,980
A giant anaconda?

1056
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,340
The giant anaconda is believed to be the largest snake in the world...

1057
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,080
You're not gonna introduce yourself?

1058
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,760
Or anything?

1059
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,820
It's not poisonous, but its large size makes it extremely powerful.

1060
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,140
They say it even eats crocodiles.

1061
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,720
Crocodiles?

1062
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,500
Its only natural predator is man.

1063
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,760
And snake.

1064
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,960
And snake.

1065
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,320
The giant anaconda is a very large snake.

1066
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,340
You should be able to capture it alive using the tranquilizer gun.

1067
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,800
Got it.

1068
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,400
So how does it taste?

1069
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,840
I knew you were going to ask me that.

1070
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,720
Glad I didn't disappoint you.

1071
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,600
So?

1072
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,260
Well, the guide says it tastes alright.

1073
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:58,800
Good.

1074
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,920
I'll have to try some.

1075
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,700
Ugh.

1076
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,840
She's already sick of his antics.

1077
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,560
Come on, paramedic.

1078
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,000
What else you got?

1079
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,480
I see you caught yourself a reticulated python.

1080
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,380
We did get the reticulated python!

1081
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,800
The reticulated python is said to be the longest snake in the world.

1082
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,220
The biggest ones can grow up to 10 meters in length.

1083
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,040
10 meters?

1084
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,840
Although they're not poisonous, they're still very dangerous.

1085
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,160
So be careful around them.

1086
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,500
Okay.

1087
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,580
They have a highly ferocious temperament, and they can swallow whole, even large animals like deer and pigs.

1088
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,380
Their most distinguishing feature is the mesh pattern of their scales.

1089
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,480
This pattern acts as a highly effective natural camouflage.

1090
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,020
Codec 141.80.

1091
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,680
Used by liquid.

1092
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,160
Snake pretending to be Iroquois, and now used by the boss.

1093
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,180
Coincidence?

1094
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,400
No, I trust the boss.

1095
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,420
It's a huge snake, but you should be able to capture it alive by using the tranquilizer gun.

1096
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,200
Oh!

1097
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,860
I'll bet if you capture one and throw it at an enemy, it'll give them a good scare.

1098
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,200
Right.

1099
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,000
But how do they taste?

1100
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,240
Do they taste good?

1101
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,900
You're actually going to eat one.

1102
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,540
Why would I be asking?

1103
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,320
What was that?

1104
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:07,820
Nothing.

1105
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,040
Let's see what the guide says.

1106
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,620
Ah, you're in luck.

1107
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,180
It says they taste pretty good.

1108
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,520
Good.

1109
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,680
I can hardly wait.

1110
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,780
I forgot to mention you guys.

1111
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,420
I forgot to mention so much.

1112
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,760
Sorry, I got so excited about starting to mention this.

1113
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,500
Try not to post spoilers in the chat.

1114
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,260
Not for my sake, but for anybody who's watching and experiencing the series for the first time.

1115
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,060
So I'll do my best also to refrain as much as I can.

1116
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,580
But...

1117
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,420
Not to say that that super chat was a spoiler or anything.

1118
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,840
I think it's just an observation.

1119
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:49,560
But...

1120
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,500
Yeah, I'm gonna...

1121
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,060
put this on, please.

1122
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,240
No spoilers in chat.

1123
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,360
And then we...

1124
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,280
pin it.

1125
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:00,940
There we go.

1126
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,320
Okay.

1127
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,060
Yeah, yeah.

1128
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,100
Just for people who are watching with us for the first time.

1129
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,060
So, I appreciate your cooperation.

1130
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,180
Camouflage is an indispensable tool when you're sneaking through the jungle.

1131
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,080
To use camouflage, first press the start button to go to the survival view.

1132
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,460
MasterBoss.

1133
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,500
Then select camouflage.

1134
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,100
And press the enter button.

1135
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,600
Select a uniform to select battle fatigues.

1136
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,040
And face to select face paint.

1137
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:32,660
I am fatigued.

1138
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:32,660
Yeah.

1139
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,840
Choose battle fatigues that match the surrounding environment.

1140
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,220
Now I'm going naked.

1141
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,180
The most effective camouflage is attained by selecting fatigues that blend in with the environment.

1142
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,940
Going with the tea.

1143
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,380
Camouflage patterns that stand out in your surroundings will attract attention.

1144
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,020
Yeah, I'm already fatigued.

1145
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,040
Boss, I don't need any...

1146
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:53,880
I don't need any more.

1147
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,720
Going with the tea.

1148
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,460
Let's see what camouflage we've got, baby.

1149
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,380
Oh, there's a mask!

1150
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,380
Yes!

1151
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,580
Oh my gosh.

1152
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,640
Woodland.

1153
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,580
We'll go with woodland for now, right?

1154
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,300
Uniform.

1155
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,280
We got...

1156
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,020
We'll do the tiger stripes.

1157
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,940
It's plus 20 right now, you know?

1158
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:29,720
If it releases 2024, MGS3 Delta or MGS3 for Delta Peace Walker?

1159
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:41,860
I probably will play Delta once, like sooner than later.

1160
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,440
Probably, you know, because it'll be it'll be just coming out.

1161
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,700
I don't want, I will not want to wait most likely, so...

1162
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,260
Yeah...

1163
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:53,780
Yeah...

1164
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,340
Oh yeah!

1165
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,400
Another important thing.

1166
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,220
The frog.

1167
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,880
Look at the python!

1168
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,100
Oh!

1169
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,240
Anaconda!

1170
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,140
Said to be so tasty.

1171
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,880
But what about the tree frog?

1172
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,460
I think the tree frog's kind of gross, probably.

1173
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,760
Sorry, I know I'm catching up on I see you've caught a tree frog.

1174
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,960
I'm catching up on Codex First.

1175
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,180
The tree frog is a green frog that's found throughout Asia.

1176
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,040
It's arboreal.

1177
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,080
Spending most of its time in shrubs and bushes.

1178
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,360
Use the tranquilizer gun to catch one alive.

1179
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,540
I bet you could scare an enemy good if you tossed one out.

1180
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,780
We're going to bring up the thermal goggles.

1181
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,560
But the tree frogs that live in that jungle are a lot bigger than ordinary tree frogs.

1182
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,000
I wouldn't want it any other way.

1183
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,620
They've got an appetite, huh?

1184
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
You've got a one-track mind, don't you?

1185
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,920
But seriously, that is one theory.

1186
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,680
I'm a simple man.

1187
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,400
However, there are people who think it's a mutation caused by nuclear testing and waste from the research facility.

1188
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,440
Do you think they're safe to eat?

1189
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,940
Is that all you ever think about?

1190
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,500
What is there?

1191
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,500
Lots.

1192
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,780
Like what?

1193
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,740
Like why a frog would get so big in the first place.

1194
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,000
Whether it's a temporary phenomenon More to eat!

1195
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:12,040
created by a unique environment or a permanent mark of evolution or a product of the toxic waste coming out of the research facility.

1196
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,620
If it is the waste that's causing it, He doesn't care about anything else.

1197
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,960
then it means humans are interfering with the ecosystem.

1198
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,200
It really makes you think about the changing relationship between This isn't interesting.

1199
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,360
Oh, fine.

1200
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,220
Be that way.

1201
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,560
So, how about it?

1202
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,060
You mean, is it edible?

1203
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:29,700
Yeah.

1204
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,740
Well, I guess it's probably okay.

1205
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,220
Probably?

1206
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,820
I don't know.

1207
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,380
The guide doesn't say anything.

1208
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,860
Pretty useless guide if you ask me.

1209
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,060
Well, try one for dinner and you can help improve it.

1210
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,220
Okay.

1211
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,280
Snake, that area is inhabited by magpies.

1212
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,020
Magpies?

1213
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,300
Magpies are members of the crow family.

1214
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,340
They're distinguishable by their beautiful dark blue and white bodies and their long tails.

1215
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,720
Their favorite food is insects, but they'll also eat small fish, acorns, and fruit.

1216
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,040
They're omnivores, which means they'll eat anything.

1217
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:06,960
Right.

1218
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,740
Just like you, huh?

1219
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,860
If you use the tranquilizer gun, you should be able to capture magpies.

1220
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,400
I mean, paramedic, you're quite the snack yourself.

1221
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:15,700
Okay.

1222
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,540
So how do they taste?

1223
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,580
Kuwabara, kuwabara.

1224
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,840
So?

1225
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,380
I've never heard of anybody actually eating a magpie.

1226
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,420
But I suppose there's no reason you couldn't.

1227
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,260
You don't say.

1228
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,480
Oh...

1229
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,880
Why does she sound so disappointed in me?

1230
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,860
Oh, why does she sound so disappointed?

1231
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,800
Okie dokie.

1232
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,120
Shall we continue onwards?

1233
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:48,260
So I know what that one...

1234
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,620
There are people complaining, right?

1235
00:52:50,700 --> 00:53:00,220
About the load times in between areas in Delta, right?

1236
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:02,600
Um...

1237
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,800
I think though...

1238
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,920
Like, I think, you know...

1239
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,440
Just to kind of like give my point of view a little bit on this.

1240
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,640
Because, you know...

1241
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,260
I don't know.

1242
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,200
I don't know.

1243
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,540
Anybody want to hear my opinion?

1244
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,060
But um...

1245
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:28,100
Essentially, there were people that were disappointed that the game wasn't more like open world.

1246
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,520
People were like I hope that Delta is like a super accurate recreation to the original.

1247
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,880
But then they're also just like...

1248
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,340
They're also just like...

1249
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,200
Wait, it's too faithful to the original!

1250
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,000
Go back!

1251
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:44,620
Go back!

1252
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,700
But also...

1253
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,580
You know, it's kind of hard to tell Um...

1254
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,420
But like...

1255
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,480
Between here...

1256
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,440
Between different areas...

1257
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,840
Is like...

1258
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:04,660
More stretch of land that they are like not including.

1259
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,300
You know what I mean?

1260
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,940
Like in certain parts of the maps as well.

1261
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,600
So you would have to really redesign like a whole lot of the game, I think.

1262
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,520
I feel like it's...

1263
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,060
Um...

1264
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:19,540
It would really break a lot of like how the game was played originally.

1265
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,800
So, you know, I know that people are like kind of...

1266
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,640
What's the word?

1267
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,660
What's the word?

1268
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,060
Divided, I suppose, between it?

1269
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:31,740
But...

1270
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:41,360
Like there are some sections that are like super duper far between sections.

1271
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,180
So...

1272
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,280
Is that a magpie?

1273
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:47,760
I don't know.

1274
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,480
I have no issue with it, to be honest.

1275
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,800
I'm fine with being able to just have the load screens and everything.

1276
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,620
Yeah!

1277
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,100
Look at the little crocodiles!

1278
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,420
They're so cute!

1279
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,780
Look at them!

1280
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,380
How do I zoom in again?

1281
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,180
Zoom in with square.

1282
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,060
Oh, triangle.

1283
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,080
Wow, it's the slowest zoom.

1284
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,300
Oh, there we go.

1285
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,240
It's pressure sensitive.

1286
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:21,700
Just kidding.

1287
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,260
Look at that guy!

1288
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,440
Oh!

1289
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,960
There he goes!

1290
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,700
Oh, I love animals.

1291
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,440
Maybe that's why I like this one so much.

1292
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,960
The motion D...

1293
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,900
I forgot.

1294
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,040
We don't have like...

1295
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,800
I didn't forget, but we don't have like a real...

1296
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,380
radar anymore or anything.

1297
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,320
Let's...

1298
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,060
Let's put these guys to sleep.

1299
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,780
Actually, it doesn't matter if I put them to sleep or...

1300
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,940
Well, goodnight.

1301
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,660
Oh my gosh, there's a bird.

1302
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:19,700
If I...

1303
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,580
Can I run over here?

1304
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,040
I think I can.

1305
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,300
Right?

1306
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,500
I'll make it.

1307
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,340
I'll make it.

1308
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:24,860
I'll make it.

1309
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,160
I'll make it.

1310
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:25,360
Okay.

1311
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,400
Here's me.

1312
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,880
Yes, need that very much.

1313
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,060
What else is in...

1314
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:34,760
this area?

1315
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,040
Goodnight.

1316
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,640
He

1317
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,070
didn't even touch you, you asshole!

1318
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:49,870
I'm sinking?

1319
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,670
No!

1320
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,130
Don't leave me alone!

1321
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:53,770
Leave me alone!

1322
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,490
Leave me alone!

1323
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,650
I'm not even bothering you!

1324
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:57,810
God!

1325
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,010
Was there anything else?

1326
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,010
Oh, the beehive!

1327
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,510
Wait, I can grab this, can I?

1328
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,150
Uh...

1329
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,250
Uh...

1330
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,150
Just keep running.

1331
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,590
Just keep going.

1332
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:32,950
Don't worry about the beast.

1333
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,050
And see, there's fruit!

1334
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:36,650
See the fruit up there too and everything?

1335
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,750
Little fruits and stuff.

1336
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:45,690
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1337
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,530
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1338
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:52,370
Ha-ha-ha!

1339
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:52,490
Ha -ha -ha -ha!

1340
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:56,310
Ah...

1341
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,230
Let's see...

1342
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,160
I don't want...

1343
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,020
I don't want to waste my bullets to shoot it down.

1344
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,020
So we'll just keep going.

1345
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,400
Onwards!

1346
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,100
Onwards.

1347
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:12,480
Onwards.

1348
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:12,560
Onwards.

1349
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,920
This is what they call a gourmet walkthrough.

1350
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:33,790
What's there?

1351
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,110
Two of them.

1352
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,210
Oh my god.

1353
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,610
Maybe you should whisper.

1354
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,330
Maybe we shouldn't talk so loud.

1355
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:03,890
The Kremlin?

1356
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:15,070
Stage whispers.

1357
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:15,870
Oh, you're right.

1358
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,490
I haven't heard that term in forever.

1359
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,110
The success of the mission depends on how well you use your camouflage.

1360
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:31,730
Change your camouflage by selecting camouflage from the survival viewer.

1361
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:38,030
The uniform option lets you pick your uniform while the face option lets you change your face paint.

1362
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:43,650
Choosing camouflage that blends in with your surroundings will help you conceal yourself more effectively.

1363
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:50,230
Also, don't forget that anything that moves will stay in your jungle.

1364
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:54,550
If you just stay and look around like an idiot, you're bound to be spotted.

1365
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:59,270
But if you crawl instead, you should be able to sneak by without being noticed.

1366
00:59:59,590 --> 00:59:59,870
Wait.

1367
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,730
He is standing right on top of them.

1368
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:02,910
How is he doing that?

1369
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,090
You can see how effective your camouflage is by looking at the camo index.

1370
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:11,390
The camo index shows how well your camouflage plays in the swarming area.

1371
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,050
Play naked!

1372
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:12,950
Play naked!

1373
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:18,090
The higher the value, the harder you are to spot, and vice-versa.

1374
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,570
The key is to make yourself one with nature.

1375
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,370
Going with the tea.

1376
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:25,330
Keep that in mind as you go along, okay?

1377
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:28,270
Okay.

1378
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:28,910
Thanks, boss.

1379
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,180
I can't believe she, like, that was the example she showed was...

1380
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:40,480
Oh, wait.

1381
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,760
Was me naked.

1382
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,220
She was just like, by the way, Snake, you can be naked if you want.

1383
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,920
I can't even look.

1384
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,240
Anyway.

1385
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,280
Our one viewer.

1386
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,660
Spin!

1387
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:20,920
Spin!

1388
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:21,620
Spin!

1389
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,400
Yes!

1390
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,560
Spin, Snake!

1391
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:25,740
Spin!

1392
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,280
I hope you have nothing in your stomach, buddy!

1393
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,040
I hope you have nothing in your stomach!

1394
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,660
Spin!

1395
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,140
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

1396
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,550
It's so gross.

1397
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:50,570
Anyway.

1398
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:53,990
Good stuff.

1399
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,830
Where are these guys again?

1400
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,600
Oh!

1401
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,340
There he is.

1402
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,100
Number two.

1403
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,960
Number one.

1404
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,310
We can take this guy.

1405
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,850
We can take this guy.

1406
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:14,550
We can take him out.

1407
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,230
I know we can.

1408
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,450
I'll get him right there.

1409
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,730
Right in the...

1410
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:24,910
Oh, where are you walking?

1411
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:25,570
Head!

1412
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,770
And your friend?

1413
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:34,390
Um...

1414
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,950
Nowhere to be found.

1415
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:51,630
Just put you there.

1416
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,170
What you got for me?

1417
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:53,810
Oh, thanks.

1418
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:55,610
I'm gonna step all over your body real quick.

1419
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,170
Don't mind me.

1420
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,310
Don't mind me stepping on you.

1421
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:00,850
Stepping on you.

1422
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:02,010
You know.

1423
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:02,830
Stepping...

1424
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,410
Where is the other guy, actually?

1425
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:04,790
Where'd he go?

1426
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:05,850
Oh, there he is.

1427
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,700
I'm sneaky.

1428
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:15,800
I'm sneaky.

1429
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,000
I'm sneaking around.

1430
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:18,840
Hey, guys.

1431
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,660
I'm sneaking around.

1432
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,300
CQC is circle, right?

1433
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:23,620
Oh!

1434
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:27,540
Oh!

1435
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,000
Ew!

1436
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,880
What do you think is in there?

1437
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,720
What are we saying about naked?

1438
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,140
Thanks for the superchats, by the way.

1439
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:35,700
Thank you, guys.

1440
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,060
I'm not standing in the open.

1441
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,400
Actually, I am.

1442
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,380
Looked at my Arcade Vendor stock.

1443
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,240
Notice MGS...

1444
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,260
Arcade Machine isn't listed anymore.

1445
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,440
You didn't have anything to do with that.

1446
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:49,820
No!

1447
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,000
I actually...

1448
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,480
Seymour, I actually didn't get it.

1449
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,440
But wouldn't it have been crazy?

1450
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,280
Why are there squares?

1451
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,560
I don't believe that.

1452
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,070
Going naked.

1453
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,850
They won't even notice a thing.

1454
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,930
They won't even suspect me.

1455
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:12,270
It's fine.

1456
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:14,510
It's so okay.

1457
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,190
Where did he go?

1458
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,330
Oh, there he is.

1459
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:18,930
Okay.

1460
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,690
I think I can get him from down here.

1461
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,430
From this far away.

1462
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,400
Wait, I can't even see his head.

1463
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:31,980
Just kidding.

1464
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:32,880
Oh, where is he?

1465
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:34,980
Are you coming this way?

1466
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:43,270
Yeah, fly away.

1467
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:44,570
Oh.

1468
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:47,670
What's up here?

1469
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,640
They call me.

1470
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:04,680
They call me the snake of the trees.

1471
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,080
Oh my god.

1472
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,140
He looks like a madman up here.

1473
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,500
He's like...

1474
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,660
He looks like a madman up here.

1475
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,460
He looks so freaky.

1476
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,660
Okay, drop.

1477
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:21,980
Wait.

1478
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,400
I'm all topsy turvy.

1479
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,580
Which way was I going?

1480
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:26,760
Uh...

1481
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:29,060
Wait.

1482
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,260
I just took out a man.

1483
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,260
Wait.

1484
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,040
Which way was I...

1485
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,860
I'm lost.

1486
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,600
I thought...

1487
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,140
Wait.

1488
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:40,880
Oh!

1489
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,240
This is the guy we just took out.

1490
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:43,960
Just kidding.

1491
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,820
I'm found.

1492
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:45,540
I'm found.

1493
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:45,660
Just kidding.

1494
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:45,660
I'm found.

1495
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:45,660
I'm found.

1496
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,580
Oh my god.

1497
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,340
There's this guy right there.

1498
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,640
The motion detector...

1499
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,260
Senses no one.

1500
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,620
The OG camera wouldn't treat me like that.

1501
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:20,940
Yeah?

1502
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:21,700
You think so?

1503
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,290
Give me whatever you got.

1504
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,590
A smoke G.

1505
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:32,030
A smoke G.

1506
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:32,290
Wait.

1507
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:33,490
I forgot to loot this guy too.

1508
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:34,910
Give me what you got.

1509
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:38,910
What do you got?

1510
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,410
What do you got?

1511
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:44,270
Wait.

1512
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,270
More bullets.

1513
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:46,750
I'll take it.

1514
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,570
Upsy daisy.

1515
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:50,950
Oh.

1516
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,710
Nobody.

1517
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,790
It's locked.

1518
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:56,650
Huh?

1519
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,270
Nobody.

1520
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,670
What are you talking about?

1521
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:00,950
Freak?

1522
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:06,530
There's no shirtless man running around the jungles.

1523
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,250
Huh?

1524
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,430
What was that?

1525
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:29,360
Oh my god.

1526
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,700
His boobs are so big that they were like clipping into his...

1527
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,800
Into his...

1528
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,760
The rest of his body.

1529
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:35,500
That's crazy.

1530
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,740
That smile.

1531
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,380
What a mischievous guy.

1532
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,440
So funny.

1533
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:46,470
You know...

1534
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,330
I...

1535
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,010
I'm so excited for Delta because one thing about...

1536
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:54,570
Keratan!

1537
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:55,870
You see him?

1538
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,150
One thing about...

1539
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:00,970
About...

1540
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,550
What's the word?

1541
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:04,550
Oh.

1542
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,370
The 3DS one.

1543
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:07,110
Is that you can crouch walk.

1544
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,690
And it's so great.

1545
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,430
I miss crouch walking.

1546
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,650
So much.

1547
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,670
I miss crouch walking.

1548
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,850
I'm too much of a baby, you guys.

1549
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,970
I'm gonna go back with...

1550
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,510
I'm too much of a baby.

1551
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,150
I'm gonna become a leaf.

1552
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,150
I'm just a simple leaf.

1553
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,710
I'm just a simple little shaken baby leaf.

1554
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:27,510
Okay?

1555
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,230
I'm just a little baby leaf.

1556
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:30,950
Okay?

1557
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:31,250
Okay?

1558
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:31,530
Okay?

1559
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:32,510
I'm...

1560
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,890
These guys, they come all the way back, don't they?

1561
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,630
And then we can get the beehive?

1562
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:50,280
Or does he run away with them?

1563
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:50,800
I can't remember.

1564
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,910
He's right under it.

1565
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,350
Let's just take it down.

1566
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:03,410
Are you kidding me?

1567
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,170
Oh wait, that's not the beehive.

1568
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:08,510
Oh shit.

1569
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,590
What's the beehive?

1570
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,290
Which one's the beehive?

1571
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:13,970
There's nothing here.

1572
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,250
Yeah, nothing here.

1573
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:16,650
That was the fruit.

1574
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,050
It looks so much like the beehive.

1575
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,110
I do that like...

1576
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,130
I think...

1577
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:23,730
There it is.

1578
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:24,850
Okay, there it is.

1579
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,890
Wait, where...

1580
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:26,450
Where is he?

1581
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:27,550
Okay, he's right under it.

1582
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:28,270
Well, kinda.

1583
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,510
Also...

1584
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,310
I hear something.

1585
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:34,510
Huh?

1586
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,510
Ah!

1587
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:40,210
Oh.

1588
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:40,910
Uh...

1589
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:41,230
Okay.

1590
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:47,630
Can you leave?

1591
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,070
Can you get out of here?

1592
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:53,470
Why

1593
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,720
couldn't you just go?

1594
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:01,620
Oh my gosh.

1595
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:01,960
Snake.

1596
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,280
Um...

1597
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,280
On my...

1598
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,800
Okay, so...

1599
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,600
Not that this is an excuse or anything, but on my monitor, you guys see it way clear...

1600
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:18,220
More clearly than I do because on my computer, it's like stretched and like ultra zoomed...

1601
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:18,880
Like ultra...

1602
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,280
Not ultra wide.

1603
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,040
But you know what I mean?

1604
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,320
And you guys are seeing like the real...

1605
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,900
Like resolution that it's supposed to be at.

1606
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,180
But I'm not playing through OBS.

1607
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,480
So...

1608
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:30,940
You know.

1609
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:33,900
Okay.

1610
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,400
Let's go.

1611
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,220
Thank you, my shell.

1612
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:43,770
Oh my gosh.

1613
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:44,730
Scared me.

1614
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,750
Oh, Kiritan!

1615
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,010
I forgot.

1616
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,410
I forgot to shoot him down.

1617
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,470
Oh my god!

1618
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:51,130
Oh my god!

1619
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:51,670
Oh my god!

1620
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,460
Please let go of me!

1621
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,740
There's no need to run!

1622
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,240
Because I'm, like...

1623
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,020
Let's go!

1624
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:14,880
Getting out of here, was I going to run?

1625
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,420
Yes.

1626
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:17,680
That's me.

1627
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,700
You're not barrels, you're like...

1628
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:21,900
Let's go.

1629
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,300
Hmm...

1630
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,720
Ugh...

1631
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,020
All right.

1632
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:25,360
We will go and then...

1633
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,740
I feel like a soldier of the 20th century.

1634
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,140
CQC is so awesome!

1635
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,050
This must be where they're holding Sokolov.

1636
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:51,500
Major, I've reached the abandoned factory where Sokolov is supposedly being held.

1637
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,480
This place is a dump.

1638
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,150
I can't see Sokolov from here.

1639
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:04,650
The security is pretty tight.

1640
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:11,450
There are sentries posted around the perimeter.

1641
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,730
Oh my god, they're everywhere.

1642
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,890
I wonder how many are inside.

1643
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:14,730
Oh no!

1644
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,410
This place is a dump!

1645
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:20,670
Poor Sokolov.

1646
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,090
Your objective, Sokolov, is inside the factory.

1647
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,570
They should be holding him in a room in the northeast section.

1648
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:27,010
Okay.

1649
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:27,810
Northeast section.

1650
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:28,310
Got it.

1651
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,190
Be careful.

1652
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,910
Your mission is to bring Sokolov back alive.

1653
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,690
He must not be exposed to any kind of danger.

1654
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:39,370
Do not approach Sokolov while in the alert phase.

1655
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:39,750
Okay.

1656
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:40,370
Right.

1657
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:42,550
Oh, and one more thing, Snake.

1658
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,090
You mean there's more?

1659
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:49,750
No, it's just that when you get to Sokolov, I want you to tell him something from me.

1660
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:50,190
Yeah?

1661
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,150
And that is?

1662
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,690
Sorry for being so late.

1663
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,010
Is that all?

1664
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:54,750
Yes.

1665
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:56,070
Understood.

1666
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,490
Beginning my approach to the target.

1667
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:00,990
Sorry for being so late.

1668
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:02,010
That's not the line.

1669
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:07,490
You can't just take my homework, you know?

1670
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:13,270
You can't just steal my line and make it your own and be like, yeah, this was my line all along.

1671
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,290
Come on, Major.

1672
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,310
Hold on.

1673
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,070
Let's also talk.

1674
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,570
I see you've got yourself a Baltic hornet's nest.

1675
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:20,830
I do.

1676
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,970
Baltic hornets are a variety of hornets that inhabit that area.

1677
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,470
I haven't saved yet, so I probably should save.

1678
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,930
I want to get the...

1679
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,810
Inside the nest are...

1680
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,150
Codex and everything, you know?

1681
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:33,550
Larvae, pupa, and adults.

1682
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,450
You can eat them all.

1683
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:35,090
You're waiting, innit?

1684
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:40,410
In particular, the honey you find inside the nest is delicious and full of nutrients.

1685
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:41,690
Nutrients.

1686
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:44,090
It's easy to digest and helps pep you up when you're feeling tired.

1687
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:47,570
In short, it's the perfect survival food.

1688
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,370
Honey can also be used as a...

1689
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:50,670
Honey.

1690
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:51,610
Oh my gosh.

1691
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:54,150
When she says it like that...

1692
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,450
It creates a protective coating over the skin.

1693
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,330
When you knock down a hornet's nest...

1694
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,150
Kind of makes me flustered a little bit, you know?

1695
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,430
A burn element will appear along with it.

1696
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:06,570
Of course, the hornets aren't going to give up their nest without a fight.

1697
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:10,690
If you knock a nest down, a large swarm of hornets will come flying out.

1698
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:11,750
So be careful.

1699
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:12,170
Yeah.

1700
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:13,910
But we were fine.

1701
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:15,530
We didn't get stung or anything.

1702
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:17,490
We're a-okay.

1703
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,750
Saving the game, Snake?

1704
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:19,530
Yeah.

1705
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,130
Are you going to stream the remake, Mint?

1706
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:25,630
Of course not!

1707
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:27,310
My gosh.

1708
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,570
No, I'm just kidding.

1709
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,630
Why would you ask me such a thing?

1710
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:31,790
I'm just kidding.

1711
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:39,870
I'll stream the remake once it goes out.

1712
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,050
Save successful!

1713
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:45,170
2099.

1714
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:45,390
Hey, Snake.

1715
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,690
You ever heard of Godzilla King of Monsters?

1716
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:48,250
It begins.

1717
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:48,830
No.

1718
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:49,370
What is it?

1719
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,690
It's a movie.

1720
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:51,770
You haven't seen it?

1721
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:52,290
Oh my gosh!

1722
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:52,750
Godzilla!

1723
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,530
It's about this monster...

1724
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:55,230
Oh my gosh!

1725
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,950
He goes to an enormous nuclear test...

1726
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:58,290
He's just there!

1727
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,690
And goes on a rampage in Tokyo.

1728
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,450
Nuclear test, huh?

1729
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:01,770
Yeah.

1730
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:05,370
Then the Marshall Islands must be crawling with giant monsters right about now.

1731
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,270
It's just make-believe.

1732
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,030
Maybe that's why my pants have been so tight lately.

1733
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:10,730
What?

1734
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,930
Snake, it's a movie.

1735
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,830
Not a report out of Los Alamos.

1736
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,070
I know.

1737
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:15,970
So then what happened?

1738
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:20,370
Godzilla is immune to all weapons, and humanity has no way to stop monsters.

1739
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:21,130
I still don't understand.

1740
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,090
Dr. Serizawa develops a new type of weapon.

1741
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,110
But meanwhile, Godzilla's getting...

1742
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:27,390
I still don't understand.

1743
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:29,390
The first time I saw it, I didn't understand it.

1744
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:29,650
Look at that.

1745
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,730
I still don't understand.

1746
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:31,510
It was originally a giant monster.

1747
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:31,770
It was originally a giant monster.

1748
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:32,370
It was a Japanese movie.

1749
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,310
But they made an American version, too.

1750
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,770
I recommend seeing the original Japanese one if you ever get the chance.

1751
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:42,730
It's mostly mindless fun, but it's also got a serious anti-nuke message as well.

1752
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:44,510
Where can I see the original?

1753
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,410
You'll just have to go to Japan.

1754
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:47,450
Really?

1755
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:48,790
That's too bad.

1756
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:49,750
You'll just have to go to Japan?

1757
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,490
And if you wait 40 years, you might be able to see it in America, too.

1758
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:53,570
Why's that?

1759
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,190
2004 will be Godzilla's 50th birthday.

1760
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:57,150
I don't want to think about it!

1761
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:58,830
You think they're still going to be making Godzilla movies?

1762
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:00,050
I want to pretend I don't know!

1763
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:01,230
Of course.

1764
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:01,750
I don't know.

1765
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,210
I want to pretend!

1766
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:03,750
I don't know!

1767
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:05,250
I'm sure you know a lot about movies.

1768
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:08,170
I don't suppose you're the movie-watching type, are you?

1769
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:09,370
Not really.

1770
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,210
Okay, then I'll tell you everything I know.

1771
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,490
When the going gets tough, movies can save your life.

1772
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:19,510
It's always good to be able to look at things from a different perspective when you get in a jam.

1773
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:20,290
A jam.

1774
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:21,310
That's the magic of movies.

1775
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:22,490
No kidding.

1776
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,810
Well, I guess it might at least make a nice distraction.

1777
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:27,830
That's the spirit snake.

1778
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:28,650
And video games.

1779
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,130
Have a little fun.

1780
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:30,650
Have a little fun.

1781
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:31,710
Have a little fun.

1782
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:31,750
Have a little fun.

1783
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,930
She says.

1784
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,090
Okay, you get out here, then.

1785
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:41,230
Why is everybody we always talk to on the codec, they're just like so nonchalant about everything.

1786
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,990
It's like, okay, well, you get your ass out here on the field, then.

1787
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,370
They're just like, oh, come on.

1788
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:47,490
Just do it.

1789
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:50,930
Just take it easy.

1790
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:51,750
Take a chill pill.

1791
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:53,910
And you're just like, maybe.

1792
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,310
You should be the one out here.

1793
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:57,530
I'm just saying.

1794
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,430
Just have fun.

1795
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:01,730
Have fun.

1796
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,690
You should be so...

1797
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:09,230
It's that one Mei Ling line that's just like, you should be grateful that you're able to have enough free time to play video games.

1798
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,510
Oh, it's so good.

1799
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:13,950
What else is paramount?

1800
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:16,150
I see you've found a Yabloko Moloko.

1801
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,930
Yabloko.

1802
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,730
Yabloko.

1803
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:19,190
What now?

1804
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:21,450
Yabloko Moloko.

1805
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:22,490
Yabloko Moloko.

1806
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:25,290
It's a Russian name that roughly translates as milk apple.

1807
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:26,510
I think Matara said...

1808
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:27,730
It's a type of star apple.

1809
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,390
I can't remember if she said that was accurate or not.

1810
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:30,490
It tastes as thick and sweet, like milk.

1811
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:31,450
Hence the name.

1812
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,730
Yabloko Moloko.

1813
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,170
Yabloko.

1814
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:32,490
Yabloko.

1815
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,010
And if you cut one in half lengthwise...

1816
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:37,210
You'll see a star shaped ring radiating out from the center.

1817
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:37,590
Wow.

1818
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,110
Hence the star apple.

1819
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,890
Right.

1820
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:44,450
The star shaped part has a gelatinous texture and a set to be especially tasty.

1821
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,510
Sounds useful.

1822
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:47,830
You're welcome.

1823
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:48,950
For once.

1824
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:49,570
You're welcome.

1825
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:50,730
Did you say something?

1826
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:51,490
No.

1827
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:52,790
Back to the mission.

1828
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:57,610
Oh wait.

1829
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,540
She messaged me about something.

1830
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,120
Actually I just got up.

1831
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:12,960
So I'm gonna respond to her.

1832
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,540
I

1833
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,330
can start signing.

1834
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,120
Yeah.

1835
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:32,900
Also...

1836
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,140
What is it?

1837
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:45,960
What is it?

1838
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,300
Yabloko?

1839
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,500
Maboko.

1840
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:58,160
Oh, mabloko.

1841
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:58,460
Shit.

1842
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,240
Wait.

1843
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,300
Wait, some people are saying...

1844
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,060
Maloko.

1845
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:02,860
Wait, what did you say?

1846
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,100
Moloko.

1847
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:04,860
Oh, hold on.

1848
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,240
Shit, hold on.

1849
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,020
Mo...

1850
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:11,700
Moloko.

1851
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,480
Yabloko moloko.

1852
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,480
Apologies about earlier.

1853
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,320
Don't apologize.

1854
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:24,780
All good.

1855
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,440
You notice how certain people keep certain codes.

1856
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,120
No, no, no.

1857
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,680
Like I said, you didn't...

1858
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,000
You just...

1859
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,820
You...

1860
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,380
Sent an observation.

1861
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,820
But it reminded me about the spoilers.

1862
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:39,880
So, no.

1863
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:40,860
Anything, I'm grateful.

1864
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,160
Yours is just an observation.

1865
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:46,200
It was about the codec stuff.

1866
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,440
What did...

1867
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:50,460
What did I say?

1868
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:50,980
Oh, okay, nevermind.

1869
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:52,940
Okay.

1870
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,140
Let's continue onward.

1871
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,180
I don't know if Matara will respond to me.

1872
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,800
But if she does...

1873
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:00,300
Yabloko.

1874
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,160
I think they'll notice me here.

1875
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,140
How many guards are there?

1876
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,060
Did you see that?

1877
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,920
That looked really cool.

1878
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,580
That was like a spy movie, wasn't it?

1879
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,880
That was pretty...

1880
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,020
That was pretty intense.

1881
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,940
That was pretty cool, if I say so myself.

1882
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:31,840
If I just run up to every single guy and CQC them, I should be fine.

1883
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,120
Parkour.

1884
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,220
I need to get this guy.

1885
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,600
Dang it.

1886
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,100
Oh, I don't want him to get...

1887
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:57,920
I don't...

1888
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,700
I don't want to get him when he's like out in the open.

1889
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,080
Wait, did he see me?

1890
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:02,860
No.

1891
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:03,620
Okay, just kidding.

1892
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,980
I'm like 90 percent.

1893
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,400
Arigato, arigato.

1894
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:09,400
Chuuu.

1895
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,120
Chuuu.

1896
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:10,820
Thank you.

1897
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:11,700
You know what?

1898
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,220
Screw it.

1899
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,050
Let's just grab him.

1900
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:25,390
Grab him and take him away.

1901
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,230
Into the bushes.

1902
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:29,750
Into the bushes you go.

1903
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,540
No one will even notice you there.

1904
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:36,840
Yeah.

1905
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:51,030
Headshot.

1906
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,870
Now we know how to get to him.

1907
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,880
Sorry, I'm a camouflage kind of gal, you know.

1908
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,520
I know there's...

1909
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,120
I think there's one guy over there, is there not?

1910
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,820
Oh, it's so nerve-wracking not having anything to tell.

1911
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,940
But this guy is like so out in the open, I want to grab him.

1912
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,440
Okay, let's just go for it.

1913
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,620
Yaboko, Yaboko.

1914
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,480
Yaboko, Yaboko, Yaboko, Yaboko.

1915
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,340
You only Yaboko once.

1916
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,220
Chaaaaaaaav!

1917
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,040
Let's go.

1918
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,560
Finish him?

1919
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,660
I'm a pacifist, what are you talking about?

1920
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:51,080
So, I've been like watching...

1921
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,940
Like some speedrun stuff.

1922
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,080
I just don't have the confidence to do it.

1923
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,200
Maybe off stream I'll like...

1924
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,220
Maybe off stream I'll like try doing some stuff and seeing what I can...

1925
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,740
What I can accomplish, you know?

1926
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:15,780
There's that hole over there, but we need to get in right there.

1927
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,280
Let's see, I don't remember how many guys are in here.

1928
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:19,360
Yeah.

1929
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,840
That's that snake, isn't it?

1930
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:30,480
Right there in the bushes.

1931
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,520
Pretty sure that's what that's detecting.

1932
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:37,220
I can't tell!

1933
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,380
Play it for fun.

1934
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,240
Yeah.

1935
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,500
I'm not trying to be speedrunner.

1936
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,720
I'm just saying.

1937
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,880
I want to...

1938
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,620
There's like really fun ways that you can mess with the guards.

1939
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,120
And I want to like...

1940
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:01,000
Like one thing that I for sure know...

1941
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,460
Sorry, I keep crouching because I'm like talking.

1942
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,920
But I see that guy.

1943
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,840
I saw him over there.

1944
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,820
Is utilizing the magazines more is one thing that I really want to do.

1945
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,520
Like the dirty... the porn magazines.

1946
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,880
I want to utilize those more.

1947
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,400
Which sounds...

1948
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,100
Sorry, that sounds kind of...

1949
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,020
Sounds kind of...

1950
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,460
But...

1951
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,780
But they're so useful!

1952
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,480
They're so useful!

1953
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:31,220
I'm not trying to...

1954
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:31,880
Not from...

1955
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,640
I'm not...

1956
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,740
I want...

1957
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,100
I'm not using them.

1958
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,820
But like the guards...

1959
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:37,860
You know?

1960
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:38,300
I'm just saying.

1961
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,200
The thin books.

1962
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,140
I own a lot of those.

1963
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:50,500
I'm just saying!

1964
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,480
Whatever you say, boy.

1965
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,420
Stop!

1966
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,600
You guys believe me!

1967
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,660
Believe me!

1968
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:06,420
I'm afraid.

1969
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,980
This game gives me indigestion.

1970
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:19,690
Oh my gosh.

1971
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,050
Can't see anything.

1972
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:22,750
Oh, hi snake.

1973
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,870
These other guys are going to wake up eventually.

1974
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:28,370
So I probably should like...

1975
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,610
Actually get moving.

1976
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:30,190
Oh my gosh.

1977
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:31,230
Oh no.

1978
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:33,570
Nothing?

1979
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:40,560
Oh my gosh.

1980
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,720
Where is that guy?

1981
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,320
That's like...

1982
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:55,600
Oh, there it is.

1983
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,020
There he is.

1984
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:56,600
Oh my gosh.

1985
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:57,180
I can get him.

1986
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,640
I can get him.

1987
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,660
Maybe if I just shoot...

1988
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:00,680
Maybe I lure him...

1989
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,280
Lure...

1990
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,380
Lure him out!

1991
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,860
That guy is going to get bit by the snake.

1992
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,940
He's going to die probably.

1993
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:11,960
Come on!

1994
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:13,020
Come on!

1995
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,920
And I'm so sorry!

1996
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:20,860
Come on!

1997
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:23,740
There it is.

1998
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:24,660
Fine.

1999
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,320
Wait.

2000
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,680
How did they hear me?

2001
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,180
Wait.

2002
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:34,880
I'm actually confused.

2003
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,140
Oh!

2004
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:37,680
Wait!

2005
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,020
Did someone wake up?

2006
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,700
Oh no!

2007
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:43,040
Did someone wake up?

2008
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,240
Oh shoot.

2009
01:26:59,130 --> 01:26:59,690
Who's...

2010
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,610
Maybe I should just go for it.

2011
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:12,270
I can't tell who saw me.

2012
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:16,710
They have good ears.

2013
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:26,920
Okay, hold on.

2014
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,880
Isn't there stuff in here anyway?

2015
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,140
Besides rats.

2016
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,200
Oh my gosh.

2017
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,280
Just a whole ass snake.

2018
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,320
A little rat.

2019
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,520
Are you just gonna eat that?

2020
01:27:58,910 --> 01:27:59,850
No one heard that?

2021
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,990
Oh, they're here in my stomach though!

2022
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:05,030
They're gonna hear my stomach.

2023
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:06,590
Let's eat.

2024
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:08,770
The tree frog is nasty.

2025
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,210
But I think we should eat it first.

2026
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:13,110
It'll go bad.

2027
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:15,050
Eat.

2028
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:22,760
Disgusting.

2029
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,460
The reticulated python?

2030
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:26,540
Good.

2031
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:31,880
Tasty.

2032
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:32,220
Yeah.

2033
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:36,860
Tasty.

2034
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:41,910
This is our...

2035
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:43,250
This is not...

2036
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,010
That's a different area.

2037
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:46,290
Is there anything else in here?

2038
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:51,270
More snake.

2039
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,550
Are the rats tasty?

2040
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:54,030
I wonder.

2041
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,850
I don't know who heard me!

2042
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:09,370
I'm still so confused.

2043
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:12,490
Rat!

2044
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:14,990
What's that sound?

2045
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:17,490
He heard me going...

2046
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:28,510
The rat.

2047
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,670
He heard me go...

2048
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:36,150
I know!

2049
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,590
Idiot!

2050
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,200
Oh my gosh.

2051
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:49,360
The caution music is so good though, right?

2052
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:52,780
Yeah, there's nothing here, bozo.

2053
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,620
I hear him walking.

2054
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:55,740
Okay.

2055
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,160
Actually, I feel like I'm in a worse spot than I was before.

2056
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,360
I feel like I'm in a worse spot than I was before.

2057
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,540
You guys love the rats.

2058
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:17,130
How do I get out?

2059
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,670
I don't remember where they're at.

2060
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:21,810
If I leave here...

2061
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:25,350
Oh my gosh, I hear him walking.

2062
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:26,290
He's like right there.

2063
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,630
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

2064
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:30,290
We're gonna...

2065
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:39,970
There's a guy here.

2066
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,850
I could probably get him in the legs, you know?

2067
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:43,670
At least.

2068
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:51,650
Never mind.

2069
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:55,570
Hold on, we could go...

2070
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:56,690
Get out of here!

2071
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,210
I wish

2072
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,880
we could go in through here.

2073
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,180
I wish we could go in through here.

2074
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:14,070
I wish we could get out of here.

2075
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,570
Sorry, Sokolov.

2076
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:15,390
No!

2077
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,270
I just caused the caution again!

2078
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,390
Nooo!

2079
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:30,330
Nooo!

2080
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:30,410
Noo!

2081
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:31,870
It was supposed to go through the hole!

2082
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:36,070
You son...

2083
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,510
You son...

2084
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,430
There.

2085
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:40,770
Well, it did go through the hole.

2086
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:51,920
My suppressor is still on, so I'm confused why they keep hearing us.

2087
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:53,700
What's wrong?

2088
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,230
Oh, dang it.

2089
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:05,990
I can't...

2090
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,990
Oh, well that was such a waste then.

2091
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,350
Do you think they'll hear it?

2092
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:19,490
You think they'll hear it this time?

2093
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:24,910
That was through the hole.

2094
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:37,810
Can you guys leave, please?

2095
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:38,550
Leave me alone.

2096
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:42,390
They're so mean to me, you guys.

2097
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:46,390
They're so mean to me.

2098
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:53,010
I can't even... I can't even leave.

2099
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,670
They're too obsessed with me.

2100
01:32:59,190 --> 01:32:59,350
Oh my god.

2101
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,790
Keep walking.

2102
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:10,550
Keep walking.

2103
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:27,320
What's wrong?

2104
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,320
What's going on?

2105
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,100
What's wrong?

2106
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:37,740
Shit.

2107
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:42,970
You guys were in a bit of a loop.

2108
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:44,150
Guys.

2109
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:45,350
What's wrong?

2110
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:46,310
Oh no.

2111
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:47,890
There's so many guys.

2112
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,920
Nothing's wrong.

2113
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:55,880
Go away.

2114
01:33:58,430 --> 01:33:59,550
What's wrong?

2115
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:00,990
What's wrong?

2116
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:03,310
The timer just keeps resetting.

2117
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:03,790
This sucks.

2118
01:34:06,210 --> 01:34:07,190
What's wrong?

2119
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:10,870
Everybody is dropping.

2120
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,650
They're dropping like flies.

2121
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:25,290
Everything is wrong.

2122
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:26,870
Everything is wrong, apparently.

2123
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:27,850
Oh my god.

2124
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:32,930
Can you leave?

2125
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,390
I should have never entered this hole.

2126
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,950
The hole is a trap, you guys.

2127
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:37,330
The hole is a trap.

2128
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:42,010
What's wrong?

2129
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:43,910
What's wrong?

2130
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:45,750
What's wrong?

2131
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:47,810
Okay.

2132
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,150
Caution.

2133
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,650
Caution over.

2134
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:52,170
We're going to...

2135
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:53,550
We're going to...

2136
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:54,650
Gun is ablazing.

2137
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:57,470
We're going to see if you see the guy up above in this hole.

2138
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,990
Up above here, we're going to take him down.

2139
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:01,690
And we're going to go to Sokolov.

2140
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,290
Probably what I should have just done.

2141
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:05,550
Should have just gone, gone fists ablazing.

2142
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,450
But you know...

2143
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:10,910
You die and learn, okay?

2144
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:13,550
Kero-tan!

2145
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,570
I see him!

2146
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,490
I see him, Kero-tan!

2147
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:22,290
There's a Kero-tan in each area.

2148
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:24,610
Is there a Kero-tan in the first first area?

2149
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:26,730
Wait, I missed two then already.

2150
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:28,390
So, what's wrong?

2151
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:29,990
What's wrong?

2152
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:32,810
What's wrong?

2153
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,780
So, I missed two already.

2154
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,040
So...

2155
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,260
No point in getting all... or trying for them, you know?

2156
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,360
Do you get a reward for finding them all?

2157
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:48,180
You do, actually!

2158
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,560
If you find them and shoot them all, yeah.

2159
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,180
What's wrong?

2160
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,000
What's wrong?

2161
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:04,560
You guys, is this the... is this the peak Metal Gear Solid gameplay you expected of me?

2162
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,160
Oh my gosh.

2163
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,360
Minto loves Metal Gear Solid.

2164
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,280
She's gonna be really good at that game.

2165
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,800
Five hours of crawling.

2166
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:23,540
The Major is probably just like, what is he doing?

2167
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,920
Why won't he leave?

2168
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:28,420
What's wrong?

2169
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,080
I know.

2170
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:33,760
I know we're on a time limit.

2171
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,360
I'm just...

2172
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,740
You know.

2173
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,080
Sokolov can wait.

2174
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,600
This guy, he's really alert.

2175
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:53,960
Patrol here.

2176
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:54,860
Patrol here.

2177
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:56,840
Unable to locate the problem.

2178
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:58,920
Understood.

2179
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:00,200
Return to your position.

2180
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:00,740
Yeah.

2181
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,740
Return to your position.

2182
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,520
Okay.

2183
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,100
Thank you, my show.

2184
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,760
I'm gonna be brave.

2185
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,700
You can...

2186
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,200
You can CQC while holding the gun, right?

2187
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:20,760
Like, that's part of the whole thing.

2188
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,520
Like, you can CQC and hold the gun.

2189
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:23,520
Right?

2190
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:29,860
I specifically said, and you know, she's...

2191
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:30,660
She what?

2192
01:37:32,260 --> 01:37:33,500
She's stayed polished.

2193
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:34,980
What does that mean?

2194
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,580
Now everybody's awake.

2195
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,280
Which is really great.

2196
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,000
Really happy about that.

2197
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:42,720
Oh my gosh.

2198
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:42,820
Oh my gosh.

2199
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:43,480
We see the sunlight.

2200
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:48,630
Oh my god.

2201
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:54,560
What's wrong?

2202
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:12,130
Oh my god.

2203
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:12,990
Are you kidding me?

2204
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:14,170
Oh

2205
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:19,580
my god.

2206
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,060
Clash of the Gods.

2207
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,620
Who is the Clash of the Gods?

2208
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:22,920
Let them leave me alone.

2209
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,100
Oh, there's two of them.

2210
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,160
Does this guy come over here?

2211
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,340
I can't remember.

2212
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,440
Hold on.

2213
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,460
I remember something.

2214
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:03,800
Oh my god.

2215
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:07,290
I can't.

2216
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,240
When will anybody ask me what's right?

2217
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,860
When will anybody ask me what's right?

2218
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,720
I'm sick of asking what's wrong.

2219
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,140
I'm sick of asking.

2220
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,400
This is what I remembered.

2221
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,860
That I can come up here.

2222
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,780
And take them down from the ceiling.

2223
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:38,320
Oh.

2224
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,380
Wait, where'd they go?

2225
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:40,980
Oh.

2226
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:41,640
Oh.

2227
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,180
Oh.

2228
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,260
Oh.

2229
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,480
If I can see them.

2230
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:47,960
Well, uh...

2231
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,020
What's wrong?

2232
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,440
Everybody says, what's wrong?

2233
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,900
Wasn't there another guy over here?

2234
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:57,760
Oh, wait.

2235
01:39:58,020 --> 01:39:58,340
Huh?

2236
01:39:58,960 --> 01:39:59,380
Are?

2237
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,420
That's him.

2238
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:00,640
Oh.

2239
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,100
They're just standing there menacingly.

2240
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,520
If I drop down...

2241
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,180
Wait, is it...

2242
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:08,180
Oh, they're both there.

2243
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:08,780
Okay, I see them.

2244
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:11,540
Do they not hear my footsteps?

2245
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:13,260
Can you move?

2246
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,120
Can you, like...

2247
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:14,800
Can you, like...

2248
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,320
I can't...

2249
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:17,840
I can't hit you from this angle.

2250
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:18,860
Maybe I can?

2251
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,120
Oh.

2252
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:20,460
Oh.

2253
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:21,180
Maybe I can.

2254
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,200
But the other guy...

2255
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:29,980
Oh, I can.

2256
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:35,660
Oh my god.

2257
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:36,440
Can we...

2258
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,520
There we go.

2259
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:38,340
Yeah!

2260
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,980
I am stronger!

2261
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,360
Okay, Snake.

2262
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,400
This is not time for Cirque du Soleil.

2263
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:50,960
Thank you.

2264
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:51,300
Oh.

2265
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:51,780
Oh.

2266
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:52,800
Oh.

2267
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:53,520
Oh.

2268
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,160
Oh.

2269
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,600
Sokodev!

2270
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,380
Give me a second.

2271
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,560
I'm gonna take their stuff.

2272
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:01,820
See ya.

2273
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,400
Again, like I said, guys.

2274
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,060
The hole...

2275
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:08,020
That was my demonstration of showing you that the hole is a trap.

2276
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:11,580
You feel safe in there, but you really aren't.

2277
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:14,960
Don't go into the hole.

2278
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:15,440
Okay?

2279
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:16,080
Anyways.

2280
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,840
Thanks for the demonstration.

2281
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,840
You're so welcome!

2282
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,700
The hole is not the goal.

2283
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:26,660
Sokodev!

2284
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,160
Sokodev!

2285
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,200
Sokodev!

2286
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,680
Avoid the hole!

2287
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:37,010
It's a non-glorious hole.

2288
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:38,690
Just like the Virtuous Mission.

2289
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:39,930
What is this?

2290
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:41,350
What is this?

2291
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:43,590
No!

2292
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:45,090
We'll never know.

2293
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:46,310
He threw it away.

2294
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,810
You must be Sokolov.

2295
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,630
Are you one of Vulcan's men?

2296
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:55,450
Oh.

2297
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:56,870
Kuwabara.

2298
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:57,790
Kuwabara.

2299
01:41:57,950 --> 01:41:58,890
You'll never get it from me.

2300
01:41:59,270 --> 01:41:59,790
No.

2301
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:00,750
You'll never get it from me.

2302
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:02,330
I'm a CIA agent.

2303
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:03,190
Yeah.

2304
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:04,230
Can't you tell?

2305
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:06,310
I've come to escort you back to the other side of the Iron Curtain.

2306
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:06,870
That's my hole.

2307
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,950
It was made for me.

2308
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,710
No!

2309
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:09,350
You're all CIA.

2310
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:10,610
Yeah.

2311
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:12,850
I was sent by Major Zero.

2312
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:14,750
The man who got you out two years ago.

2313
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:15,250
Tell him what he said.

2314
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:15,810
Tell him what he said.

2315
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:16,390
Tell him what he said.

2316
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:16,970
He said...

2317
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:18,070
Kept you waiting, huh?

2318
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:19,110
Zero.

2319
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:21,750
I have a message from him.

2320
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,170
What is it?

2321
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:26,330
He said to tell you, sorry for being so late.

2322
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:30,290
Did he now?

2323
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:30,750
He said to tell you, sorry for being so late.

2324
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,350
What is it?

2325
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:32,490
What does it mean?

2326
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:34,510
He said...

2327
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:36,910
It means he's a man of his word.

2328
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:37,510
Ah.

2329
01:42:39,810 --> 01:42:41,490
But we've got no time for this.

2330
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:43,570
You have to get me out of here before they arrive.

2331
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:46,690
Who's they?

2332
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:47,490
Who's they?

2333
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:49,670
Colonel Vulgin of Groove.

2334
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:50,270
Groove?

2335
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:52,530
You in the West know him as Thunderbolt.

2336
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:55,750
That's that guy from Minions.

2337
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:57,510
Never heard of him.

2338
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:00,730
He's a member of the Iron Curtain.

2339
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,690
Real footage.

2340
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:16,570
And they're both.

2341
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,550
Oh my god!

2342
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:36,850
That already happened!

2343
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:42,030
It means he cut the line.

2344
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:47,210
Oh my gosh!

2345
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:49,570
There he is!

2346
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:58,010
Colonel Vulcan!

2347
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,850
Oh my god!

2348
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:22,170
Oh my gosh.

2349
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:23,350
That guy.

2350
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:27,410
He looks like... a freak.

2351
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:35,510
The intelligence says that they are going to make their move during the test.

2352
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,330
Have I seen the secret leader?

2353
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:36,790
I have!

2354
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,970
But it's on a different disc.

2355
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:44,970
Exactly.

2356
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:48,110
They wouldn't need that many men just to keep me inside.

2357
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:53,590
Their orders were to prevent Colonel Vulcan from capturing me.

2358
01:44:57,730 --> 01:45:00,270
Even if it meant killing me in the process.

2359
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:01,750
Or so it would seem.

2360
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:03,130
So it would seem.

2361
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:06,190
I hope Delta has secret leader.

2362
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:06,750
Me too!

2363
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,030
I hope so too.

2364
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:10,610
Oh my gosh.

2365
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:11,550
The cutscenes.

2366
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:16,550
The secret leader cutscenes in high def will be...

2367
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,170
Too much.

2368
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,670
I should have changed to naked.

2369
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:24,290
Oh.

2370
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:25,270
Russian Jozu.

2371
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,030
Where did you learn to speak it?

2372
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,330
From my mentor.

2373
01:45:32,770 --> 01:45:33,770
Is that so?

2374
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:34,310
Oh snake.

2375
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:35,450
Oh my gosh.

2376
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:36,130
I've seen your face again.

2377
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:37,490
America is truly a frightening country.

2378
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:41,170
Having second thoughts?

2379
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:43,330
No.

2380
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:45,110
I have no love for this place.

2381
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:45,610
Let's go.

2382
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:46,650
Dang.

2383
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:53,590
I feel like with Sokolov's jacket, it looks like one of those that would squeak at every time he moves.

2384
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:57,010
We're trying to do a stealth mission and this guy is in full on leather.

2385
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:00,870
He takes two steps and it's like Spongebob.

2386
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:02,710
Sokolov is safe with me.

2387
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,010
He's doing fine.

2388
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:04,750
No injuries.

2389
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:06,070
Good work, Snake.

2390
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:08,570
Now hurry up and get Sokolov to the recovery point.

2391
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:10,290
We'll rendezvous with you there.

2392
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:11,130
Rendezvous.

2393
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:12,530
What about the sentries?

2394
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:14,310
No one spotted me.

2395
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:15,830
I see.

2396
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:17,070
The Fonz jacket.

2397
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:19,850
We lost contact with the boss some time ago.

2398
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:20,730
What happened?

2399
01:46:21,090 --> 01:46:21,430
Uh oh.

2400
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:23,050
It's probably just a weak signal.

2401
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:25,110
Just hurry and get Sokolov out of there.

2402
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:25,390
Okay.

2403
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:26,690
No.

2404
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:27,170
The boss.

2405
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:29,970
It's because she's too deep in the sauce.

2406
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:31,910
Submarine sauce.

2407
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:33,990
Okay.

2408
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,150
Alright.

2409
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,290
Quiet, Sokolov.

2410
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:36,990
Quiet.

2411
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:39,290
Quiet.

2412
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,230
Oh my god.

2413
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,470
I'm not... you guys.

2414
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:49,430
Oh god.

2415
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:50,030
Okay, you guys.

2416
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,450
I'm not...

2417
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:52,370
You guys, my heart is not...

2418
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:54,270
You guys, I'm not ready, I think.

2419
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:56,090
You guys, I'm not ready, I think.

2420
01:46:58,930 --> 01:46:59,950
You guys, I'm not ready, I think.

2421
01:46:59,950 --> 01:47:00,430
I don't think I'm ready.

2422
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:02,370
I don't think I'm ready right now.

2423
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:07,410
You guys, I don't think I'm ready.

2424
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:08,750
What is this position?

2425
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:10,670
What is this stance, Sokolov?

2426
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:12,830
He's trying to be like me.

2427
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:15,630
He's like Kamehameha-ing.

2428
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:17,250
Oh gosh.

2429
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:17,690
Oh gosh.

2430
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,030
Oh gosh.

2431
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:18,390
Oh gosh.

2432
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:23,750
I'm so ready.

2433
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:24,590
I'm so...

2434
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:25,670
I'm not ready.

2435
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:26,710
I'm not normal.

2436
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:27,430
I'm not...

2437
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:27,630
Ah!

2438
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,400
Oh gosh.

2439
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,600
I'm not normal.

2440
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,660
I'm not normal.

2441
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:37,440
I thought I'd be normal.

2442
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:37,780
Freeze!

2443
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:40,980
Oh my gosh.

2444
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,920
They got us so fast.

2445
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,700
So this is the legendary boss.

2446
01:48:01,260 --> 01:48:05,860
You made it last.

2447
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,240
Oh my god.

2448
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,200
Oh my god.

2449
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:11,180
You.

2450
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:14,280
You're from the Ocelot unit of Spetsnaz.

2451
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:17,960
What's a Gru soldier doing here?

2452
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:20,880
That's my reaction.

2453
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:22,420
Oh my god.

2454
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:22,900
Soldier?

2455
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,150
Who's the Ocelot commander?

2456
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:40,930
That's Major Ocelot to you.

2457
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:43,590
Oh my g...

2458
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:44,070
Don't you forget.

2459
01:48:47,330 --> 01:48:47,890
No!

2460
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:52,730
Sokolov is ours.

2461
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:54,570
Now get out of here.

2462
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:57,790
And Ocelot never lets his prey escape.

2463
01:48:57,910 --> 01:48:58,570
Oh my god.

2464
01:48:58,850 --> 01:48:59,230
My...

2465
01:48:59,230 --> 01:48:59,530
What?

2466
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:02,790
Ocelot will get you.

2467
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,990
Oh my gosh.

2468
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:08,150
My bratty little...

2469
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:12,430
Oh my god.

2470
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:17,460
Oh my god.

2471
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:17,740
No.

2472
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,660
I'm not ready for it to happen right now.

2473
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:20,960
You got...

2474
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:21,560
Oh guys.

2475
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:22,440
I'm gonna cry.

2476
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:23,520
I'm gonna cry.

2477
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:24,000
I'm gonna cry.

2478
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:27,960
Get him.

2479
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,380
He's up there.

2480
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:41,640
No.

2481
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,320
I'm not ready.

2482
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,760
I'm not ready for them to touch.

2483
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:45,440
I can't.

2484
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,260
No.

2485
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,720
I can't say it feels good to kill a comrade.

2486
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,520
Even if it is for the Gru.

2487
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:12,380
Sokolov, take cover.

2488
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,040
He's wanting a hug.

2489
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:23,540
Oh my gosh.

2490
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,580
I'm getting a stomach ache.

2491
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:26,220
I'm so excited.

2492
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:30,100
Why does he look at him like that?

2493
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:30,500
Stop.

2494
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:31,600
You're not the boss, are you?

2495
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:32,520
Stop, you freak.

2496
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:36,520
Freak meet freak.

2497
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:54,180
I can't.

2498
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,800
What is that stance?

2499
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:00,620
That gun.

2500
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:01,960
Oh my god.

2501
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:04,120
Everybody laugh.

2502
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,080
Everybody laugh.

2503
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,600
You're not the boss.

2504
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:11,900
Oh my gosh.

2505
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,460
Then die.

2506
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,520
Idiot.

2507
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:18,900
Oh my god.

2508
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:19,240
This one.

2509
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:23,660
Shut

2510
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:28,220
up.

2511
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:28,580
Shut up.

2512
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,660
Leave it.

2513
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:31,800
Shoot the other one.

2514
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:33,980
Shoot the other one.

2515
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:35,660
Wow.

2516
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:49,400
So awesome.

2517
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:54,200
What is that one guy who's like in the background?

2518
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,640
He's really losing it.

2519
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:10,150
You get tranked, little guy.

2520
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:12,530
Shaggy.

2521
01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:15,530
Is that an Ocelot emoji?

2522
01:52:15,950 --> 01:52:16,670
Oh my god.

2523
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:17,510
Oh my god.

2524
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:18,250
No, no, no, no, no.

2525
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:20,150
Oh my god.

2526
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:24,830
I love CQC, baby.

2527
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:26,270
Oh my god.

2528
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:28,430
I love CQC, baby.

2529
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:32,250
Say it.

2530
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:35,230
Tell him everything he's doing, Roxnake.

2531
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:37,950
Possible.

2532
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:39,730
Oh my god.

2533
01:52:39,730 --> 01:52:41,950
You ejected the first bullet by hand, didn't you?

2534
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:45,630
He's like, the way he's like wriggling on the ground.

2535
01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:48,350
But to testing a technique you only heard about in the middle of battle wasn't very smart.

2536
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:50,810
You were asking to have your gun jammed on you.

2537
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:51,450
Dun dun.

2538
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:54,870
Besides, I don't think you're cut out for an automatic in the first place.

2539
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:55,450
Oh my god.

2540
01:52:55,450 --> 01:52:58,010
He's sitting with like a halo around him.

2541
01:52:58,110 --> 01:52:59,850
It's like a true Little Mermaid moment.

2542
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:01,290
That's more of a revolver technique.

2543
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:05,230
You filthy American dog!

2544
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:16,650
Just keeps getting his ass handed to him.

2545
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:23,410
But that was some fancy shooting.

2546
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:25,290
You're pretty good.

2547
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:31,570
Pretty... good.

2548
01:53:34,290 --> 01:53:35,350
I can't look.

2549
01:53:35,610 --> 01:53:36,550
I can't look.

2550
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:37,190
I can't look.

2551
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,530
I absolutely cannot look.

2552
01:53:38,590 --> 01:53:39,290
I cannot look.

2553
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,050
I cannot see.

2554
01:53:40,090 --> 01:53:40,970
I cannot see this.

2555
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:41,630
I can't hear.

2556
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:44,350
I can't watch them.

2557
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:52,890
That was the moment.

2558
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:55,950
That was the moment his life changed.

2559
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:00,250
I have to go to the bathroom.

2560
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:01,470
Snake, you alright?

2561
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:04,910
Dog!

2562
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:20,790
Three most romantic words ever said.

2563
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:24,010
Oh my gosh.

2564
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:28,850
That moment literally rewired his brain.

2565
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:30,830
Oh gosh.

2566
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:33,330
It's the most romantic thing ever.

2567
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:42,590
I love that moment!

2568
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:47,470
It rewired your brain.

2569
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:48,550
Absolutely.

2570
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:50,030
Oh my god.

2571
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:51,810
Oh my god.

2572
01:54:57,170 --> 01:54:58,450
Little sleepy boy.

2573
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:01,510
Yeah, you sleep down there.

2574
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:04,490
You sleep...

2575
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:05,570
Look at his hands.

2576
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:06,370
So funny.

2577
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:07,670
What's with that stance?

2578
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:12,310
Okay, I gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

2579
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:12,930
I'll be right back.

2580
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:18,490
Wait, but these guys... they don't wake up.

2581
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:26,970
I'm taking him with me.

2582
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:34,520
Come on Bracelot.

2583
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:39,100
We're going home.

2584
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:44,600
Mousetrap!

2585
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,620
Okay, I do actually have to pee though.

2586
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:47,380
So I'll be right back.

2587
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:53,580
Just gotta go to the bathroom real quick.

2588
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:57,140
B.R.V.

2589
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:33,040
Ya bloco maloco.

2590
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:34,920
Oh my gosh.

2591
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:36,200
I...

2592
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:38,160
I...

2593
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,280
Um...

2594
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:42,520
I...

2595
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,640
Didn't put...

2596
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,080
I ran out of toilet paper.

2597
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:51,200
And didn't put it in the closet.

2598
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:52,840
In the bathroom.

2599
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:54,720
So I had to...

2600
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:55,460
I had to...

2601
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,760
I had to run pantsless to go and get it.

2602
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,480
Oh my gosh.

2603
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,780
I have to...

2604
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,420
Holy cow.

2605
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:12,600
Thank you Johnny Moe.

2606
02:00:13,460 --> 02:00:14,120
Thank

2607
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:20,020
you so much!

2608
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:22,520
What the heck!

2609
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,960
Thank you!

2610
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:26,060
How...how...how...how...how...

2611
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:38,090
I don't have anything.

2612
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:47,190
Did I grab everything?

2613
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:49,210
In this area as well?

2614
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:55,530
Where was Kero-tan?

2615
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:57,830
We saw him from...

2616
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:59,130
That hole.

2617
02:00:59,830 --> 02:01:01,290
I actually don't see him here.

2618
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:06,410
Oh there he is.

2619
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,180
Oh my god.

2620
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:11,740
Please!

2621
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:12,440
Please!

2622
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:13,280
You're walling!

2623
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:13,740
For real!

2624
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:14,260
For real!

2625
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:14,680
For real!

2626
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:15,120
For real!

2627
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:15,540
For real!

2628
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:16,320
For realist!

2629
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:17,240
For the realist!

2630
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:17,760
Realist!

2631
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:18,800
Thank you!

2632
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:19,460
But seriously!

2633
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:20,320
Oh my gosh.

2634
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:20,600
Please.

2635
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:21,560
Please.

2636
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,020
It's okay.

2637
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:24,240
Thank you but please!

2638
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,060
Thank you so much!

2639
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:29,400
Oh my gosh.

2640
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,080
Why so many?

2641
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:37,460
I really shouldn't have had coffee and like...

2642
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,500
Watch that scene.

2643
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:43,260
It just made like the coffee...

2644
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:44,300
You know like...

2645
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:45,840
It just went...

2646
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:46,580
I was just like...

2647
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:49,060
It's forced the liquid out of my body.

2648
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:51,480
I was like...

2649
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:52,640
I have to pee now.

2650
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,720
Is there anything else here?

2651
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:57,340
I don't remember.

2652
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,160
Oh my gosh.

2653
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:01,660
Oh my god.

2654
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:01,960
Thank you!

2655
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:05,910
Too much!

2656
02:02:07,930 --> 02:02:10,110
Is your wallet okay for real though?

2657
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:15,530
Is your wallet okay for real though?

2658
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:15,790
Do

2659
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,980
you want to save?

2660
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:25,600
The only freak I saw during that cutscene was the bottom right.

2661
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:26,340
Stop.

2662
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:29,240
Who was in the bottom right?

2663
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:31,760
It was...

2664
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,400
Ocelot.

2665
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:35,660
You're welcome.

2666
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:36,560
Stop.

2667
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:05,580
Why does it say 2099?

2668
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,780
Because my PS2 clock is wrong.

2669
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:11,600
It's a lot more intense, but...

2670
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:15,020
It wouldn't be referring to you coming from outer space, would it?

2671
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:16,540
How rude!

2672
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,520
Why do you say that?

2673
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:21,520
Because no one on Earth could be as charming as you.

2674
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:25,040
Sorry, I'll just get to the point, Snake.

2675
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:27,780
Be careful of what's around you when you're in the water.

2676
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:33,220
Just imagining you swimming in those jungle rivers makes me think of you being attacked by a fishman.

2677
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,120
A fishman?

2678
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:36,760
Snake is so... smooth.

2679
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:39,120
Fishmen aren't the only things that will attack you in the water.

2680
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,960
Really be careful out there.

2681
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:41,880
Okay.

2682
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:46,040
And don't be attacking any pretty girls going for a swim, either.

2683
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:48,240
Are you calling me a fishman?

2684
02:03:48,660 --> 02:03:49,760
You started it.

2685
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:52,260
Fishmen.

2686
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,680
She really isn't responding.

2687
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,020
Oh wait, where do I go for Sokolov again here?

2688
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:00,740
I can't... I don't remember.

2689
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,200
Snake, stay alert.

2690
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:05,440
The KGB and Gru both have their sights set on Sokolov.

2691
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:08,020
Gru is a military espionage outfit.

2692
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:11,980
The intelligence wing of the Soviet Defense Ministry's General Staff Office.

2693
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:18,260
It competes with the KGB, which is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the two are always watching each other.

2694
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:21,300
Never let the left hand know what the right hand is doing.

2695
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:22,420
Exactly.

2696
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:23,380
Yes.

2697
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:29,400
Now, added to that rivalry, there's a vicious power struggle going on between the Khrushchev faction and the anti-Khrushchev faction.

2698
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:30,820
Thanks for the super chat.

2699
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:31,680
Lambda, please!

2700
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:35,660
And Volgin and the anti-Khrushchev forces are using the grunt.

2701
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:37,000
That's the idea.

2702
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:37,640
What's happening?

2703
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:39,220
The two factions are fighting over Sokolov.

2704
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:42,420
We're in an extremely dangerous situation here.

2705
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:44,080
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

2706
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,220
Get Sokolov out of there safely.

2707
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:50,380
He must not be turned over to the KGB or to the Gru.

2708
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:52,580
He must be turned over to my arms.

2709
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:53,080
Sokolov took off in the direction of the rope bridge.

2710
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,080
Get after him.

2711
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:54,720
Hurry!

2712
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:55,520
Oh, the rope bridge.

2713
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:56,380
Oh, yes.

2714
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:57,320
How could I forget?

2715
02:04:57,460 --> 02:04:58,540
Okay, yes, of course.

2716
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:03,240
I was getting ahead of myself with that exit.

2717
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:04,020
Hahaha.

2718
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:06,740
Go!

2719
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:07,200
Go!

2720
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:07,540
Go!

2721
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:09,460
Sokolov!

2722
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:09,880
Sokolov!

2723
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:10,100
Oh, wait.

2724
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:12,700
I'm taking you with me.

2725
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:14,900
Come on.

2726
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:18,620
This way.

2727
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:21,720
This way.

2728
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,460
Bro has the philosopher's legacy.

2729
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:25,340
Hahaha.

2730
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:28,600
Okay.

2731
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:42,970
I'm legitimately concerned.

2732
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:45,070
I'm legitimately concerned.

2733
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:48,250
Thank you.

2734
02:06:02,110 --> 02:06:03,090
Okay, here we go.

2735
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:10,690
Ocelot's coming with.

2736
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:14,030
Don't leave him behind, Snake.

2737
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:15,730
You better drag him with us.

2738
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:16,350
No!

2739
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:27,260
Why did you leave him?

2740
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,880
Do you guys hear a storm approaching?

2741
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:33,160
Okay.

2742
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,460
Those men were from the ocelot unit.

2743
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,220
Spetsnaz?

2744
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:36,240
Yes.

2745
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,780
The best crew has to offer.

2746
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:41,200
They're coming for me.

2747
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,440
I'm finished.

2748
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:44,780
Calm down.

2749
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:46,900
I'll get you out of here.

2750
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:47,440
I promise.

2751
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:50,020
And we've got some of the best backup we could ask for.

2752
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:52,540
Uh-oh.

2753
02:06:56,580 --> 02:06:58,220
What is that thing?

2754
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:03,500
That's what they were making you build.

2755
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:04,560
Yes.

2756
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:05,810
The Shagahod.

2757
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:06,790
The Shagahod.

2758
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:08,280
A treading behemoth.

2759
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:10,600
A tank capable of launching nuclear weapons.

2760
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:11,360
Dry RPMs.

2761
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,920
It can launch nuclear missiles from that kind of terrain?

2762
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:14,740
Oh, yes.

2763
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:17,620
And without support from friendly units.

2764
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:21,640
A nuclear-equipped tank capable of operating solo.

2765
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:25,800
Wow!

2766
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,740
Is that thing finished?

2767
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:29,900
No.

2768
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:32,840
This is only the end of Phase One.

2769
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:37,540
It won't be truly finished until we complete Phase Two.

2770
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:38,600
Phase Two.

2771
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:38,740
What's next?

2772
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:41,240
The weapons truly fall.

2773
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:43,100
One.

2774
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:43,580
Two.

2775
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,800
What comes after one?

2776
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:45,620
If it is completed, the colonel gets his hands on it.

2777
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:46,780
Phase Two.

2778
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:48,580
It will be the end of the Cold War.

2779
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:49,680
The end of the Cold War.

2780
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,500
Thank you for the gift, dude.

2781
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:51,240
Yes.

2782
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:56,000
And then the age of fear will truly begin.

2783
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:57,120
Thank you for the gift, dude.

2784
02:07:57,860 --> 02:07:58,480
Oh, no!

2785
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,600
The guy had no choice but to cooperate.

2786
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,260
I didn't want to die.

2787
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:08,320
I wanted to see my wife and child again.

2788
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:09,000
In America.

2789
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:10,320
Please.

2790
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:11,880
Take me to America.

2791
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:12,600
Quickly.

2792
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:17,980
They cannot complete it without my help.

2793
02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:18,640
Yeah.

2794
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:19,760
Got it.

2795
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:20,660
Let's go.

2796
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,040
Yeah.

2797
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:21,940
We're on our way.

2798
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:22,620
Come on.

2799
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:23,200
Let's go.

2800
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:25,900
Okay.

2801
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:26,360
Here we go.

2802
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:27,520
All right.

2803
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:29,820
To America.

2804
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,160
To America.

2805
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:34,300
All right.

2806
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:35,380
We just got to get... Okay.

2807
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:37,460
Be careful on this bridge, Sokolov.

2808
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:38,600
I slipped off of it earlier.

2809
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:40,320
Yeah.

2810
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:42,320
Do you hear thunder?

2811
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:43,480
No.

2812
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:48,860
Oh, my gosh.

2813
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,100
Take off that squeaky...

2814
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:50,320
Yeah.

2815
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:50,680
Don't look.

2816
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:51,360
Don't look down.

2817
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:51,920
Don't look down.

2818
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:55,440
Freaky.

2819
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:55,760
Freaky.

2820
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:00,680
Ooh.

2821
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,260
Starting to get pretty misty.

2822
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:04,080
Whoa.

2823
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,200
I get misty.

2824
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,360
The moment you're near.

2825
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:11,300
What was that?

2826
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:15,570
Huh?

2827
02:09:16,190 --> 02:09:17,150
Who is that?

2828
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:25,600
Boss.

2829
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,700
The boss.

2830
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:30,800
Oh, my gosh.

2831
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,400
Another 50.

2832
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,060
Thank you.

2833
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:32,760
Boss.

2834
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:33,620
Please.

2835
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:34,620
I'm really concerned though.

2836
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:45,950
Good work, Jack.

2837
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:47,230
Yeah?

2838
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:48,170
What are you doing here?

2839
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:50,330
Sokolov comes with me.

2840
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:50,610
Oh.

2841
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:50,770
Wait.

2842
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:53,710
You were supposed to be in the Arctic.

2843
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,740
How did you get here so fast?

2844
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:01,660
Oh.

2845
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:02,360
Oh, no.

2846
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:02,920
Not the bees.

2847
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:05,480
Not the bees.

2848
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:06,200
Ow.

2849
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:09,780
Ow.

2850
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:14,660
Oh, my God.

2851
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:22,460
Sokolov.

2852
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:24,500
Look.

2853
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:25,580
He's petting those bees.

2854
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:32,480
He's petting those bees.

2855
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:37,180
Not the bees.

2856
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:38,120
Not the bees.

2857
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:42,980
Snake is so calm about this.

2858
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:45,080
He's just like, well, shucks.

2859
02:10:50,830 --> 02:10:51,510
Yeah.

2860
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:55,910
My friends.

2861
02:10:56,530 --> 02:10:58,250
Let us fight together again.

2862
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:59,090
My NAKAMA.

2863
02:11:02,050 --> 02:11:03,770
His voice is so funny.

2864
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:05,050
We will fight with you.

2865
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:11,310
Oh my god.

2866
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:17,150
My favorite bosses!

2867
02:11:20,110 --> 02:11:22,330
I love cover unit!

2868
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:23,510
I love cover unit!

2869
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:28,580
It's raining.

2870
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:30,340
It's raining blood.

2871
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:31,620
Oh, it's raining blood.

2872
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,600
Sorry, I should have been more specific.

2873
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:35,000
Is he crying?

2874
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:41,100
The sorrow.

2875
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:44,700
Thank you.

2876
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:46,660
Leo Red!

2877
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:00,860
Kuwabara!

2878
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,720
Kuwabara!

2879
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:09,500
Oh my gosh, you guys are here witnessing.

2880
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:11,980
Sorry, I'm really brain rotted.

2881
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:12,920
I'm so sorry.

2882
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,380
Ah, what a joyful scene.

2883
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:20,120
You guys missed me with Ocelot though, so maybe it's okay.

2884
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,140
Welcome to my country.

2885
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:24,720
And to my unit.

2886
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:29,480
I love Vulcan, even though he's such a bastard.

2887
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,620
Boss, what is this?

2888
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:34,640
I'm defecting to the Soviet Union.

2889
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:37,500
Sokolov is a little gift for my new hosts.

2890
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:41,060
Recoilless nuclear warheads.

2891
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:43,220
Recoilless?

2892
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,560
It's crazy that Vulcan is a fan of yours.

2893
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:51,480
Kuwabara, kuwabara.

2894
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:51,840
Who is he?

2895
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,100
Another one of your disciples?

2896
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:55,840
What do you mean another one?

2897
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:56,780
I'm THE disciple.

2898
02:12:58,360 --> 02:12:59,680
Are we taking him with us?

2899
02:12:59,780 --> 02:13:00,460
Thanks for the gift.

2900
02:13:00,780 --> 02:13:01,540
Best sadness.

2901
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:04,600
Too pure for us cobras.

2902
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:05,860
I'm just a baby.

2903
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:07,740
Just a baby.

2904
02:13:08,060 --> 02:13:10,400
He has not yet found an emotion to carry into battle.

2905
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:12,600
What are you talking about?

2906
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:16,580
Do you think you can pull the trigger?

2907
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:18,340
Rookie's eyes.

2908
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:25,040
She takes apart my whole gun in one move.

2909
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:26,080
It's insane.

2910
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:27,260
She's so awesome.

2911
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,240
The boss is so cool.

2912
02:13:34,820 --> 02:13:35,380
Sorry.

2913
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:44,310
I don't like seeing him in pain.

2914
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:45,810
Oh my god.

2915
02:13:45,850 --> 02:13:47,750
Thank you.

2916
02:13:51,370 --> 02:13:53,030
We can't let him live.

2917
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:53,410
No!

2918
02:13:55,670 --> 02:13:57,110
Kuwabara, kuwabara.

2919
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:03,620
If Khrushchev finds out about this, we're finished.

2920
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:07,620
He

2921
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:13,080
must die.

2922
02:14:13,420 --> 02:14:13,620
No!

2923
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:15,720
Wait.

2924
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,680
He's my apprentice.

2925
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:19,340
I'll take care of him.

2926
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:23,900
He's my apprentice.

2927
02:14:23,900 --> 02:14:24,080
He's my apprentice.

2928
02:14:24,080 --> 02:14:24,120
I'll take care of him.

2929
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:25,920
I'll take care of him.

2930
02:14:25,980 --> 02:14:26,420
Jack.

2931
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:28,760
You can't come with us.

2932
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,380
You can't sit with us.

2933
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:35,580
Why are you extending a hand?

2934
02:14:36,140 --> 02:14:37,100
Come on.

2935
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:38,060
Come on, mom.

2936
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,320
Don't do this to me.

2937
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:49,760
What did you think was going to happen?

2938
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:50,500
What's going to happen?

2939
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:57,700
He's so...

2940
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:59,460
His eyes darting everywhere.

2941
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:00,480
It's so sad.

2942
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,560
He's so like...

2943
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:05,500
He took her bandana.

2944
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:06,820
He's like...

2945
02:15:06,820 --> 02:15:07,720
He's so...

2946
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:09,000
Sorry.

2947
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:11,860
The grunts are so...

2948
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:16,640
Does anyone else just randomly do the hater grunt while driving?

2949
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:18,080
The new blood has been rejected.

2950
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:21,500
I do the hater grunt all the time.

2951
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:21,720
I do the hater grunt all the time.

2952
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:21,960
I just go...

2953
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:27,020
No!

2954
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:27,740
Snake!

2955
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:32,200
Are we done here?

2956
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:36,500
Now onto Sokolov's research...

2957
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:37,740
He looks so confused.

2958
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:40,080
During this whole exchange.

2959
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:41,940
It's so sad.

2960
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,260
It's so sad for him.

2961
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:47,860
Seriously.

2962
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:48,860
The way he grunts.

2963
02:15:56,780 --> 02:15:58,440
My place is with them now.

2964
02:15:58,900 --> 02:15:59,260
No!

2965
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:00,660
Boys!

2966
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:03,180
Boys!

2967
02:16:10,780 --> 02:16:11,620
He's like...

2968
02:16:12,110 --> 02:16:14,880
He wants to sound like a Great Dane.

2969
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:17,140
But he just reminds me of a Chihuahua.

2970
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:17,420
You know?

2971
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:19,340
Just because it's always like a...

2972
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:22,120
Like, you know...

2973
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:25,400
When Simba's trying to growl in the Lion King.

2974
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,360
That's what it's like.

2975
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:26,880
Oh my gosh.

2976
02:16:26,980 --> 02:16:29,280
I've given up.

2977
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:30,660
I've given up on your wallet.

2978
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:32,600
I think you have too.

2979
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:33,640
But thank you.

2980
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:37,360
I just can't only say thank you.

2981
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:38,520
But please be responsible.

2982
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,300
For their money.

2983
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:42,880
Snake's alive.

2984
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:43,780
Snake's alive.

2985
02:16:48,660 --> 02:16:49,100
Snake,

2986
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:53,500
can you hear me?

2987
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:55,440
Yeah.

2988
02:16:56,380 --> 02:16:57,260
Just barely.

2989
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:59,780
Snake, listen to me.

2990
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:01,440
You need emergency medical treatment.

2991
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:02,140
Can you move?

2992
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:03,520
Snake!

2993
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:07,780
You've got to get those wounds treated.

2994
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:08,420
Hang in there.

2995
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:11,860
Alright, let's get you fixed up.

2996
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:12,540
Paramedic?

2997
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,860
Okay, Snake.

2998
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:17,080
Just relax and it'll all be over before you know it.

2999
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:18,220
Oh my gosh, she's gonna kill me.

3000
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:21,380
Snake!

3001
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,320
Stay with me.

3002
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:24,480
I've seen people in worse shape before.

3003
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,240
Think you can handle it?

3004
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:28,340
Major.

3005
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:30,300
The boss.

3006
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:32,660
She's defected.

3007
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:33,420
That's all he cares about.

3008
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:35,620
First we've got to get you patched up.

3009
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:36,740
That's all he cares about.

3010
02:17:36,740 --> 02:17:37,380
Here we go.

3011
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:40,160
Oh, gosh, open the menu.

3012
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:42,220
First open the survival viewer with the start button.

3013
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:43,920
Ohh, no.

3014
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:45,680
If you select Cure you can start the treatment.

3015
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:51,780
Healing is divided into treatment using medicine with the item window button Yes.

3016
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,020
and surgical treatment using the weapon window button.

3017
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:54,520
Yes.

3018
02:17:54,920 --> 02:18:01,300
Your injuries include a fractured left elbow or rib bone and lacerations on your upper arms, right elbow and abdomen.

3019
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:04,780
They need to be fixed using surgical treatment.

3020
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:05,220
No.

3021
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:07,360
H Situation is at risk.

3022
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:12,080
Risking a guy in that much pain to do surgery on himself is pretty insane.

3023
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:14,700
It's kind of insane.

3024
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:19,320
Use the left analog stick to select the medical item and then press the enter button.

3025
02:18:19,480 --> 02:18:19,740
Yes.

3026
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:23,020
With this method you can use items to help your recovery process.

3027
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:23,760
Yes.

3028
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:29,360
To treat a bone fracture, first secure the affected area with a fastener and then wrap it in bandages.

3029
02:18:29,520 --> 02:18:30,500
That should do it.

3030
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:31,960
Not the bone fracture.

3031
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:31,960
It's crazy.

3032
02:18:31,960 --> 02:18:39,420
For lacerations, you'll need disinfectant to clean the wound, sutures to stitch it up, styptic to slow the flow of blood, and bandages to wrap the wound.

3033
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:42,940
If you do everything I mentioned, the wound should heal completely.

3034
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:44,820
Understood?

3035
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:46,160
Yeah.

3036
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,740
Stay with me.

3037
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:50,500
Go into the survival view and treat the wound.

3038
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,120
Okay.

3039
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:55,120
I'm going into the menu!

3040
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:56,820
Cure!

3041
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:03,660
Oh, we're like losing life fast fast.

3042
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:03,980
Okay.

3043
02:19:04,620 --> 02:19:05,140
Alright.

3044
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:05,540
Cure!

3045
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:06,660
Ooh!

3046
02:19:07,580 --> 02:19:07,740
Okay.

3047
02:19:08,330 --> 02:19:08,600
Alright.

3048
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:10,140
Suffering from a deep cut.

3049
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:10,720
Bleeding.

3050
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:11,460
No bandage applied.

3051
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:12,780
Not yet disinfected.

3052
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:13,320
So we gotta...

3053
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:15,500
We gotta surgically disinfect.

3054
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:18,460
Disinfect.

3055
02:19:19,330 --> 02:19:19,600
Oh.

3056
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:20,600
Disinfect.

3057
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:23,180
Oh, okay.

3058
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:24,240
What about the other ones?

3059
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:25,400
No bone fracture.

3060
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:27,380
Disinfect.

3061
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:30,060
Disinfect.

3062
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:32,280
Disinfect to protect.

3063
02:19:33,330 --> 02:19:33,600
Disinfect.

3064
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:34,080
Okay.

3065
02:19:34,180 --> 02:19:35,000
No more disinfect.

3066
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,710
Next we do...

3067
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:41,330
Do we have to suture?

3068
02:19:41,530 --> 02:19:41,950
Wait.

3069
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:44,810
Suture?

3070
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:49,550
Oh.

3071
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:53,050
Suture?

3072
02:19:54,730 --> 02:19:55,150
Wait.

3073
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:55,890
Was this one a cut?

3074
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:56,110
Yeah.

3075
02:19:56,210 --> 02:19:56,630
Suture.

3076
02:19:57,650 --> 02:19:58,350
Broken bone.

3077
02:19:58,650 --> 02:19:59,170
You know.

3078
02:19:59,230 --> 02:20:00,150
We just got broken bones.

3079
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:00,590
Whatever.

3080
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:01,970
Broken bone.

3081
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:02,430
A cut.

3082
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:03,650
Suture.

3083
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:04,050
Okay.

3084
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:04,970
Alright.

3085
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:06,150
Um.

3086
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:07,110
Um.

3087
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:08,490
I love this.

3088
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:09,490
The bones...

3089
02:20:09,490 --> 02:20:10,890
Just put a band-aid on it.

3090
02:20:10,990 --> 02:20:12,550
Just put a band-aid on it.

3091
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:13,470
Gosh.

3092
02:20:13,650 --> 02:20:14,850
All you have to do is just...

3093
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:15,490
Easy.

3094
02:20:16,350 --> 02:20:16,790
Um.

3095
02:20:16,970 --> 02:20:17,230
Oh.

3096
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:19,170
And the splint.

3097
02:20:21,310 --> 02:20:21,750
Yay!

3098
02:20:23,150 --> 02:20:23,590
Um.

3099
02:20:23,630 --> 02:20:25,790
Just put a band-aid on it.

3100
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:26,730
Just put a...

3101
02:20:27,490 --> 02:20:28,650
Just put a band-aid.

3102
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:29,330
Easy.

3103
02:20:30,370 --> 02:20:31,110
Band-aid?

3104
02:20:35,540 --> 02:20:36,620
What did I forget here?

3105
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:39,240
Wait.

3106
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:39,800
I'm still bleeding.

3107
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:39,800
What am I reading?

3108
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:40,640
What did I forget?

3109
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:43,800
Ointment?

3110
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:46,540
No, for burns.

3111
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:48,580
It's the styptic?

3112
02:20:57,050 --> 02:20:57,370
Yeah!

3113
02:20:57,490 --> 02:20:58,210
Okay, okay.

3114
02:20:58,710 --> 02:21:01,570
There we go.

3115
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:02,990
Yay!

3116
02:21:03,430 --> 02:21:04,170
Okay, okay.

3117
02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:04,850
Styptic.

3118
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:06,690
Styptic.

3119
02:21:07,170 --> 02:21:08,150
And then...

3120
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:09,630
Bandage, right?

3121
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:09,990
Yeah.

3122
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:12,450
Okay!

3123
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:12,770
Okay!

3124
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:17,260
Okey-dokey.

3125
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:19,960
We're all good.

3126
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:33,070
I don't like this.

3127
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:33,730
I don't like this.

3128
02:21:33,810 --> 02:21:34,390
I don't like this.

3129
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:35,570
I don't like this.

3130
02:21:46,350 --> 02:21:47,070
Oh gosh.

3131
02:21:47,750 --> 02:21:49,210
Oh gosh, it hurts so bad.

3132
02:21:51,610 --> 02:21:52,010
Ugh.

3133
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:53,770
I'm an empath, you guys.

3134
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:54,470
Oh my gosh.

3135
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,450
How do you...

3136
02:21:55,450 --> 02:21:56,890
How are you gonna look after this?

3137
02:21:57,010 --> 02:21:57,890
In Delta, I wonder.

3138
02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:00,850
They're like, All wounds stay on your body!

3139
02:22:02,130 --> 02:22:03,830
I mean, I know these are like...

3140
02:22:06,370 --> 02:22:07,990
scripted wounds, so I wonder.

3141
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:10,090
Oh...

3142
02:22:10,850 --> 02:22:11,250
Snake!

3143
02:22:14,050 --> 02:22:15,290
Oh, the bandana!

3144
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:16,630
Oh my gosh, what have I done?

3145
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:17,270
Thank you!

3146
02:22:24,010 --> 02:22:25,290
Good job, Snake.

3147
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:27,790
We're coming to get you now.

3148
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:28,810
Just stay where you are.

3149
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:30,210
We'll drop a recovery balloon.

3150
02:22:30,410 --> 02:22:31,050
Fulton Meow!

3151
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:31,550
Can you set it up?

3152
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:35,170
Also, Pepman, I...

3153
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:36,430
just saw your...

3154
02:22:36,430 --> 02:22:37,490
dono...

3155
02:22:38,170 --> 02:22:38,710
um...

3156
02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:40,510
about gifts outside of a convention.

3157
02:22:41,170 --> 02:22:42,750
I don't actually...

3158
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:43,790
Oh wait.

3159
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:44,510
Hold on.

3160
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:47,730
We just barely saw him.

3161
02:22:49,330 --> 02:22:53,050
I don't actually have a way, but maybe in the future.

3162
02:22:53,330 --> 02:22:54,930
But thank you for thinking of me.

3163
02:22:55,070 --> 02:22:56,050
I really appreciate it.

3164
02:22:57,970 --> 02:22:58,650
A body.

3165
02:22:58,690 --> 02:22:59,470
Did you see the skelly?

3166
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:04,510
The shagohod.

3167
02:23:06,850 --> 02:23:07,930
The shagohod.

3168
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:16,950
His arms are droopy.

3169
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:22,330
He's like when you pick up a cat and his arms just like spread out.

3170
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,140
Papers!

3171
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:35,100
Scissors!

3172
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:51,250
Always go rock.

3173
02:23:54,950 --> 02:23:57,070
Little droopy shagohod.

3174
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:59,430
He's like put me down!

3175
02:23:59,690 --> 02:24:00,730
Put me down mom!

3176
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:02,590
Come on!

3177
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:03,450
Come on!

3178
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:04,230
Put me down!

3179
02:24:04,310 --> 02:24:05,010
Put me down!

3180
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:06,410
Oh no.

3181
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:08,810
Here's where it all really begins.

3182
02:24:08,970 --> 02:24:09,430
Oh my gosh.

3183
02:24:09,490 --> 02:24:10,910
This guy is...

3184
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:16,190
He is so...

3185
02:24:17,930 --> 02:24:19,010
I can't!

3186
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:29,470
He's sitting there just pondering all his life choices.

3187
02:24:29,630 --> 02:24:30,750
He's like what the hell?

3188
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:35,650
He's actually seething.

3189
02:24:35,650 --> 02:24:36,110
For real.

3190
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:43,810
Thanks to the boss and her cobras, I have both Sokolov and the shagohod.

3191
02:24:44,590 --> 02:24:45,370
Stinky woman.

3192
02:24:49,290 --> 02:24:50,170
Girl smell?

3193
02:24:50,830 --> 02:24:51,670
Girl smell?

3194
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:54,330
God, this guy is such a freak.

3195
02:24:54,610 --> 02:24:55,910
What are we going to do with the girl?

3196
02:24:57,850 --> 02:24:58,790
Who is she?

3197
02:25:01,070 --> 02:25:02,850
Apparently she's Sokolov's woman.

3198
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:04,010
Sokolov!

3199
02:25:04,010 --> 02:25:04,970
You dog!

3200
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:09,330
How did you manage to grab such a babe?

3201
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:13,210
Not her scooting away.

3202
02:25:16,810 --> 02:25:18,090
She's a nice catch.

3203
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:18,930
Yeah.

3204
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:20,790
I'll take her.

3205
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:22,910
I'll take her?

3206
02:25:23,670 --> 02:25:25,330
Not so fast, my dear.

3207
02:25:27,890 --> 02:25:28,990
Finders keepers.

3208
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:29,010
The other three are not so much as fakers.

3209
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:33,910
It's just lipstick.

3210
02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:40,210
A kiss of death.

3211
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:41,750
You KGB.

3212
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:43,570
We may be able to use her.

3213
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:50,550
She has spunk.

3214
02:25:51,550 --> 02:25:52,170
Ooh!

3215
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:56,170
The way she's like not even making any sort of sound.

3216
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:58,750
The way she's like not even making any sort of sound.

3217
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:08,190
Everyone in this game is a freak.

3218
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:11,450
I think maybe that's why I love it so much.

3219
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:12,250
Uh-oh!

3220
02:26:13,010 --> 02:26:13,570
Uh-oh!

3221
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:18,530
Uh-oh!

3222
02:26:18,530 --> 02:26:19,910
But it won't be me that pulled the trigger.

3223
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:24,770
It'll be our friend, the American defector.

3224
02:26:24,930 --> 02:26:26,950
You're going to nuke your fellow Russians?

3225
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:29,030
This is where the...

3226
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:30,050
Remember the Alamo.

3227
02:26:30,050 --> 02:26:30,310
Ah!

3228
02:26:30,330 --> 02:26:31,590
Remember the Alamo!

3229
02:26:54,810 --> 02:26:56,590
Remember the Alamo.

3230
02:26:57,890 --> 02:26:59,010
Oh man.

3231
02:27:07,330 --> 02:27:10,710
Oh my gosh, in that one moment, he looks like that meme.

3232
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:13,150
A minor spelling mistake.

3233
02:27:15,170 --> 02:27:18,050
For just a split second, he looked like that meme.

3234
02:27:30,210 --> 02:27:31,610
Minor spelling mistake.

3235
02:27:33,730 --> 02:27:35,170
Oh gosh.

3236
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:37,550
Let's save, yes.

3237
02:27:43,750 --> 02:27:48,310
Sorry, my PlayStation's clock is off.

3238
02:27:49,770 --> 02:27:51,270
If you couldn't tell.

3239
02:27:53,810 --> 02:28:00,390
I realize, because my clock is off and is kind of weird...

3240
02:28:00,390 --> 02:28:01,730
I will probably...

3241
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:05,170
I'll have to, like, be very careful about when...

3242
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:08,770
About when I do the end fight.

3243
02:28:08,770 --> 02:28:09,650
Yeah!

3244
02:28:11,690 --> 02:28:14,410
Then I'll bite off!

3245
02:28:14,690 --> 02:28:15,350
Yeah!

3246
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:15,630
Yeah!

3247
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:52,030
But you're so supreme Ba-ba-da-ba-da Ooh,

3248
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:09,300
snake eater In my time There'll be no one else

3249
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:30,000
Crying is the way I'm flying to you I'm still in a dream Snake eater

3250
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:58,760
Someday you go through the rain And someday you feed on a tree frog It's ordeal, the trial to survive I'm still in a dream For the day we see new light I give my life Ooh,

3251
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:14,820
snake eater In my time There'll be no one else

3252
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:24,800
Crying is the way I'm flying to you

3253
02:30:28,060 --> 02:30:35,340
I'm still in a dream Snake eater

3254
02:30:40,460 --> 02:31:00,200
Ba -ba-da-ba-da I'm still in a dream Snake eater Snake, snake, snake Snake, snake, snake Snake, snake, snake In the dream

3255
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:31,260
There's a plane Doing out the window On a ice cube I'll make you Become my guide By landing on the same platform In this peomnia As the cause of our family Drone oil pressure and voltage are nominal.

3256
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:32,860
Such a great, amazing song.

3257
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:34,300
Halo oxygen supply is nominal.

3258
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:36,200
Thank you for the super!

3259
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:36,660
Thank you!

3260
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:39,880
No gusts.

3261
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:42,940
All systems go for drone detachment.

3262
02:31:44,480 --> 02:31:47,160
Snake, we can't risk a Halo jump this time around.

3263
02:31:48,020 --> 02:31:50,720
Airspace security has gotten tighter since we were last here.

3264
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:51,080
Okay.

3265
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:54,200
We can't get as close to the ground as we did during the Virtuous mission.

3266
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,800
So instead, we'll be using one of our newest weapons.

3267
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:01,400
Snake, you're being given an honor on par with Alan Shepard.

3268
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:03,820
This is our last chance.

3269
02:32:04,220 --> 02:32:05,640
Show your patriotism.

3270
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,400
If you fail, you'll be back in a hospital bed again waiting for the firing squad.

3271
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:12,000
That's not right!

3272
02:32:12,940 --> 02:32:15,160
Okay, what's it like if I failed?

3273
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:20,060
What if there's ex- Then maybe you should be sending a whole team in!

3274
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:24,100
Would you do me a favor and tell the suits about visiting hours?

3275
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:27,740
I'll never get better with them assaulting me day and night with their questions.

3276
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:31,420
Must be part of the top brass' inquiry.

3277
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:33,200
More like an interrogation.

3278
02:32:33,620 --> 02:32:37,020
According to them, I'm a traitor and an accomplice to the boss' defection.

3279
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:39,980
They're just looking for a scapegoat.

3280
02:32:40,460 --> 02:32:42,260
Does that mean they're after you, too?

3281
02:32:43,700 --> 02:32:46,740
Let's just say neither one of us is going to be made a national hero out of this.

3282
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:49,400
Does this mean Fox is going to die?

3283
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:50,640
No.

3284
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:52,800
This Fox is still one step ahead of the house.

3285
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:55,920
The reason I came to see you today... Jack?

3286
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:56,660
I'm a scapegoat.

3287
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:57,820
I'm a scape- A snake!

3288
02:32:58,280 --> 02:32:59,500
What are you talking about?

3289
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,340
The situation has changed.

3290
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:03,500
We've still got a chance to come out of this one alive.

3291
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:03,860
Yeah?

3292
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:04,740
What kind of chance?

3293
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:05,940
Don't get too excited.

3294
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:08,220
Here.

3295
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:09,020
Have a cigar.

3296
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:10,500
It's Cuban.

3297
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:10,780
Whoa!

3298
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:11,680
Oh my gosh.

3299
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:13,760
Major disappeared.

3300
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:14,480
He's a ghost.

3301
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:16,000
Oh my gosh, look at him.

3302
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:17,960
He's... he's glitching around.

3303
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:19,540
This morning, I had a meeting with the CIA.

3304
02:33:20,420 --> 02:33:22,560
They decided when they're going to execute us?

3305
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:22,920
No.

3306
02:33:24,940 --> 02:33:26,160
Something even bigger.

3307
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:26,260
Bigger?

3308
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:31,420
Yesterday, the White House received an unexpected call.

3309
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:33,440
From?

3310
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:34,460
President Johnson.

3311
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:34,960
Oh.

3312
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:38,360
Yes, I hear you, Mr. Chairman.

3313
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:41,600
Accents.

3314
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,760
It was a hotline call from Khrushchev to President Johnson.

3315
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:45,620
From the head of the Soviet Union?

3316
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:46,520
That's right.

3317
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:56,780
A few days ago, one of our country's main design bureaus, OKB-754, was destroyed in a nuclear explosion.

3318
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,340
Wasn't me.

3319
02:33:58,400 --> 02:34:00,200
At about the same time, Wasn't me.

3320
02:34:00,200 --> 02:34:05,140
our anti-aircraft radar picked up a signature that appeared to come from one of your military aircraft.

3321
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:07,840
I wrote my master's thesis about the development of the A-12 at Blackburn.

3322
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:08,480
No way!

3323
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:10,420
Does any of this sound familiar to you?

3324
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:17,280
In retaliation, I have placed our armed forces on secondary alert.

3325
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:26,320
Depending on your response, I may be left with no choice but to order the military to maximum alert and unleash Armageddon.

3326
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:34,140
With the help of your predecessor, I was able to survive the Cuban incident.

3327
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:39,360
But my power is not as great as it once was.

3328
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:46,860
If I am to survive this crisis, I must have your full cooperation.

3329
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:51,040
I should have contacted you myself.

3330
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:56,340
Did you know that one of our soldiers defected to your country a week ago?

3331
02:34:57,240 --> 02:34:57,880
No.

3332
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,840
So you haven't heard that?

3333
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:07,420
The man who arranged the defection was a group colonel by the name of Yevgeny Vorosevich Volgin.

3334
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:08,900
Which one's American?

3335
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:11,800
Of the Brezhnev faction.

3336
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:13,560
Go on.

3337
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,160
Who is this soldier?

3338
02:35:16,620 --> 02:35:18,600
Her name is The Boss.

3339
02:35:19,260 --> 02:35:20,760
The first name The?

3340
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:21,020
The Living Legend.

3341
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:21,740
Last name Boss.

3342
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:25,820
During World War II, she was the one who led us to victory in that war.

3343
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:30,060
In Russia, you know her as Voyevoda.

3344
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:33,400
You mean... The Boss?

3345
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:34,160
The Boss.

3346
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:36,100
The mother of your special forces?

3347
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:37,200
The very one.

3348
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:38,360
Yep, that's the one.

3349
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:38,860
Yep.

3350
02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:42,740
And she took two miniature nuclear shells along with her.

3351
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:43,200
Oh yeah.

3352
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:46,620
The Boss took two miniature nuclear shells.

3353
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:47,620
Oh yeah, absolutely.

3354
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:48,900
I'm afraid so.

3355
02:35:49,020 --> 02:35:49,380
Yeah.

3356
02:35:49,380 --> 02:35:51,920
I believe they were a gift for her new hosts.

3357
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:53,720
Howdy-do.

3358
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:58,100
The Davy Crockett Atomic Battle Group delivery system was completed two years ago.

3359
02:35:59,240 --> 02:35:59,880
Remember the Alamo!

3360
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:02,960
Serious problems were found with the launcher's range and precision.

3361
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:04,220
So exciting.

3362
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:07,900
Although they were mass produced, they've never been deployed in battle.

3363
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:12,420
But Sokolov's research facility was completely wiped out.

3364
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:14,580
The whole area is polluted.

3365
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:19,360
I can only offer you my deepest condolences over this terrible tragedy.

3366
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:30,660
So, the Boss, with Colonel Vulcan's help, stole two experimental nuclear shells and took them with her as a gift when she defected.

3367
02:36:30,760 --> 02:36:39,320
Then, shortly thereafter, Sokolov's design lab, a top-secret military research facility, was destroyed by one of these weapons.

3368
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:41,920
Am I right so far?

3369
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:43,940
Yes, that's correct.

3370
02:36:44,100 --> 02:36:48,820
And the American government denies any involvement in the affair.

3371
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:50,820
Is that right as well?

3372
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:52,340
That's correct.

3373
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:54,340
We were not involved in any way.

3374
02:36:54,660 --> 02:36:58,720
Then what was a US military aircraft doing on our radar screen?

3375
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:02,080
It was clearly a violation of our airspace.

3376
02:37:02,420 --> 02:37:06,040
And yet you say it was not acting under your orders.

3377
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:07,780
That's correct.

3378
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:13,020
You expect me to believe that this was all the work of a single soldier?

3379
02:37:13,820 --> 02:37:16,160
I don't know what else to tell you.

3380
02:37:16,780 --> 02:37:18,800
The Army insists that this is a war.

3381
02:37:18,820 --> 02:37:20,200
This is all a ploy on your part.

3382
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:25,840
I've said it once and I'll say it again, our government had nothing to do with it.

3383
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:28,640
And I would like dearly to believe you.

3384
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:33,060
However, I'm afraid my power over the military has weakened since the beginning.

3385
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:34,800
I would never tell a lie.

3386
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:38,680
I will need some kind of proof that this was not the action of the American government.

3387
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:38,900
I'm George Washington.

3388
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:41,820
I've got wood teeth and I never tell a lie.

3389
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:44,020
You have one week.

3390
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:48,580
You must catch the boss yourselves and recover the remaining nuclear devices.

3391
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:49,040
G.W.

3392
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:53,600
Then you must find some way to prove your innocence.

3393
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:55,920
Prove our innocence?

3394
02:37:57,580 --> 02:37:58,140
Yes.

3395
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:00,780
Preferably something painful.

3396
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:01,800
Painful?

3397
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:04,880
Prove to me that this is not merely another one of your tricks.

3398
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:08,700
The boss should be close to Colonel Boyd.

3399
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:11,520
How about a little co-action?

3400
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:11,780
That's correct.

3401
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:12,880
May I know your involvement?

3402
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:14,780
I would not expect too much if I were you.

3403
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:16,800
The political situation here is unstable.

3404
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:17,340
No.

3405
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:22,180
Colonel Vulcan is a member of the Brezhnev faction, which seeks to topple my government.

3406
02:38:23,140 --> 02:38:23,660
Topple?

3407
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:24,040
One week.

3408
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:26,180
You have only one week.

3409
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:29,800
And if it is not too much to ask, do something about Vulcan as well.

3410
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:30,380
Okay.

3411
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:32,100
What is that supposed to mean?

3412
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:32,740
Nothing.

3413
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:36,020
It means nothing.

3414
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:37,680
It means do... I mean...

3415
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,040
Call it a modest gentleman's agreement to ensure our continued relationship.

3416
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:46,760
What if we can't prove our innocence?

3417
02:38:48,580 --> 02:38:50,540
Then I will be unable to restrain the military.

3418
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:51,760
I will be ousted.

3419
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:53,800
And they will seek their revenge.

3420
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:54,660
Oh my God.

3421
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:57,620
A nuclear attack on the United States?

3422
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:05,080
You leave the disposal of this situation entirely to your discretion, Mr. President.

3423
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:06,180
Mr. President.

3424
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:06,800
Disposal.

3425
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:12,260
If you fail, it will mean the beginning of a new world war.

3426
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:12,580
Oh my God.

3427
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:14,820
We just got out of another world war.

3428
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:16,220
Chill.

3429
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:21,840
To put it simply, in order to avoid a full-scale nuclear conflict, we have to prove that America was not involved in that explosion.

3430
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:24,740
We'll go into the war more.

3431
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:25,900
And eliminating the boss ourselves will prove America's innocence?

3432
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:27,400
Right.

3433
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:32,780
The higher-ups have decided that you're the only one capable of pulling this off.

3434
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:35,380
You were her last apprentice.

3435
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:38,200
Screw this one up and we'll both be six feet under.

3436
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:39,500
There's no choice.

3437
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:43,780
I keep yawning.

3438
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:44,260
Sorry.

3439
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:47,760
Are the Russians going to be helping us?

3440
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:54,360
The KGB has promised to lend us one of their communications satellites so that you and I can talk to each other.

3441
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:56,920
That's it?

3442
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:59,720
They've also put us in touch with a couple of insiders.

3443
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:00,760
Insiders?

3444
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:04,160
There was a defection in September 1960.

3445
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:06,080
Do you remember it?

3446
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:07,880
I like the view.

3447
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:10,720
You mean the two NSA codebreakers who went over to the Soviet Union?

3448
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:12,500
Precisely.

3449
02:40:13,020 --> 02:40:13,780
You mean...

3450
02:40:13,780 --> 02:40:16,500
Since then, they've apparently been training with the KGB.

3451
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,300
They're exactly this kind of situation.

3452
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:20,580
They're codenamed Adam and Eva.

3453
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:22,220
Adam and Eva?

3454
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:24,320
I've been told that Adam has infiltrated Vulcan's ranks.

3455
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:29,000
We've also arranged for him to provide you with an escape route.

3456
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:32,040
You'll need to rendezvous with him when you get there.

3457
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:32,460
Okay.

3458
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:36,320
Canelo, welcome to membership.

3459
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:36,920
Thank you.

3460
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:40,940
Control.

3461
02:40:49,910 --> 02:40:51,170
Unidentified aircraft detected.

3462
02:40:51,370 --> 02:40:52,670
Altitude 30,000 feet.

3463
02:40:55,210 --> 02:40:55,790
Uh-oh.

3464
02:40:55,990 --> 02:40:56,430
Don't...

3465
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,860
Maybe we should've... Maybe you should've just had me jump.

3466
02:41:02,860 --> 02:41:03,480
It's fast.

3467
02:41:04,360 --> 02:41:06,100
Estimated airspeed exceeding Mach 3.

3468
02:41:06,200 --> 02:41:08,200
You know, like, maybe I should've just...

3469
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:09,280
I'm about to lose it.

3470
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:10,520
Maybe...

3471
02:41:24,840 --> 02:41:26,640
He's, like, making a real crash landing.

3472
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:27,800
Oh, wowie.

3473
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:29,760
He's, like... Okay.

3474
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:30,500
Yeah, there you go.

3475
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:30,880
Pull up.

3476
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:31,280
Pull up!

3477
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:32,100
Pull up!

3478
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:35,020
Pull up!

3479
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:35,620
Pull up!

3480
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:37,460
Pull up!

3481
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:39,080
Pull up!

3482
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:39,500
Pull up!

3483
02:41:43,400 --> 02:41:44,080
Eject!

3484
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:44,760
Eject!

3485
02:41:44,780 --> 02:41:45,380
Eject!

3486
02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:47,760
Uh-oh.

3487
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,620
Those are clean.

3488
02:42:02,980 --> 02:42:04,760
Not the snake in the background.

3489
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:11,620
Like, there's just a full-on, like, slithery snake in the background.

3490
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:12,720
Just chillin'.

3491
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:17,160
Uh, I don't think your bones are completely healed, man.

3492
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:18,900
Like, maybe you shouldn't be rollin' around.

3493
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:21,520
Like that.

3494
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:22,560
I'm scared for you.

3495
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:29,330
What's this mission called, you think?

3496
02:42:29,590 --> 02:42:31,110
We just had a virtual mission.

3497
02:42:31,250 --> 02:42:31,850
What's this one?

3498
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:35,980
This is Snake.

3499
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:37,020
Do you read me?

3500
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:38,140
Loud and clear.

3501
02:42:38,360 --> 02:42:39,740
Glad to see you landed safely.

3502
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:41,840
I got blown pretty far off target.

3503
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:42,380
Oh.

3504
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:45,500
Snake, let's go over your mission objectives one more time.

3505
02:42:46,440 --> 02:42:47,480
Rescue Sokolov.

3506
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:51,840
Find out what's happened to the Shagahod, then destroy it.

3507
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,380
And finally, eliminate the boss.

3508
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:54,460
No!

3509
02:42:55,320 --> 02:42:56,260
Eliminate the boss.

3510
02:42:56,800 --> 02:43:00,380
This mission will be codenamed Operation Snake Eater.

3511
02:43:00,680 --> 02:43:03,560
Because I'll be taking on the boss in our Cobra unit, right?

3512
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:05,540
Don't forget about Colonel Vulcan.

3513
02:43:05,620 --> 02:43:05,980
Aw, yeah.

3514
02:43:06,020 --> 02:43:07,080
I'm not a hired killer.

3515
02:43:07,580 --> 02:43:08,300
I know.

3516
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:09,840
But that was the Kremlin's demand.

3517
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,240
Demand?

3518
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:12,920
You mean it wasn't just a request?

3519
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:14,760
Title drop, baby.

3520
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:17,400
What's it to us if the Khrushchev regime is threatened by the Colonel and his faction?

3521
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:22,860
If supporting the current regime helps us avoid a nuclear exchange, then that's what we'll do.

3522
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:25,040
And what are the CIA's demands?

3523
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:29,600
Our priorities are the rescue of Sokolov and the destruction of the Shagahod.

3524
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:31,500
Roger that, Major Tom.

3525
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:32,780
Major Tom.

3526
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,040
Hold on, Snake.

3527
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,340
What now?

3528
02:43:33,780 --> 02:43:35,300
I'm changing my codename.

3529
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:38,580
It turns out Tom wasn't the most auspicious choice.

3530
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:39,020
What?

3531
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:39,680
What do you mean?

3532
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:43,700
Well, the truth is, when I chose my codename, I picked the wrong one.

3533
02:43:43,820 --> 02:43:45,760
What do you mean you picked the wrong one?

3534
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:47,620
Did you ever see the movie The Great Escape?

3535
02:43:47,800 --> 02:43:48,800
It came out last year.

3536
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:50,500
I must have missed that one.

3537
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:56,100
Anyway, it's based on a true story about prisoners who escaped from a POW camp in Nazi Germany.

3538
02:43:56,420 --> 02:44:01,660
The prisoners dig three tunnels as part of their plan, but the Nazis find two of the tunnels before they're finished.

3539
02:44:01,780 --> 02:44:02,120
Dun dun!

3540
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:05,320
The prisoners succeed in escaping by using the last remaining tunnel.

3541
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:09,460
The names of those three tunnels were Dick, Harry, and Tom.

3542
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:10,800
So you're... you're Major Dick.

3543
02:44:11,080 --> 02:44:15,560
You used the name of the tunnel they escaped in as your codename because you thought it would bring you good luck.

3544
02:44:15,860 --> 02:44:17,140
Yes, that's exactly right.

3545
02:44:17,220 --> 02:44:18,600
At least, that was the plan.

3546
02:44:19,360 --> 02:44:19,800
But...

3547
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:21,580
But I got the name wrong.

3548
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:23,860
The one they escaped in was Harry.

3549
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:26,020
Tom was one of the unlucky tunnels.

3550
02:44:26,200 --> 02:44:28,620
It was discovered by the Nazis before it was finished.

3551
02:44:28,780 --> 02:44:29,380
Oh, shucks.

3552
02:44:29,560 --> 02:44:31,640
I watched the movie again just to make sure.

3553
02:44:31,860 --> 02:44:34,960
In fact, I even ordered the actual film from the movie company.

3554
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:36,480
A simple mistake, you know.

3555
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:37,400
Yeah, it doesn't sound like the greatest name for you.

3556
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:38,880
So it's his fault that we all failed.

3557
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:39,800
So what should I call you?

3558
02:44:39,840 --> 02:44:40,380
It's not us!

3559
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:43,360
You know, let's just use zero.

3560
02:44:43,540 --> 02:44:44,020
Zero.

3561
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:44,880
Like we've been doing all along.

3562
02:44:45,480 --> 02:44:46,280
Alright then.

3563
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:47,800
Major Zero it is.

3564
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:49,820
We'll start over from square one.

3565
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:52,080
From square zero?

3566
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:56,940
My frequency is 140.85.

3567
02:44:57,120 --> 02:44:58,240
Yeah, it's all zero spot.

3568
02:44:58,520 --> 02:44:59,240
Oh, I almost forgot.

3569
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:01,320
Paramedic is with us again on this mission.

3570
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:01,980
Paramedic!

3571
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:03,380
Is this her last chance too?

3572
02:45:03,980 --> 02:45:07,000
If we fail, she'll have her medical license revoked.

3573
02:45:07,080 --> 02:45:07,540
Oh.

3574
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:08,960
It's more or less the same kind of fate.

3575
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:09,720
But like...

3576
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:10,980
Her frequency...

3577
02:45:10,980 --> 02:45:11,820
She's not doing anything.

3578
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:12,620
...is the same as during the virtuous mission.

3579
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:13,340
Why would it be revoked?

3580
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:15,800
145.73.

3581
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:20,480
She'll be recording your mission data as well, just like the last time.

3582
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:22,560
That frequency is also the same.

3583
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:25,820
140.96.

3584
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:29,300
And there's one more person on your support team.

3585
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:29,800
One more?

3586
02:45:30,040 --> 02:45:31,240
His name is Mr. Siggint.

3587
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:32,260
Siggint?

3588
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:35,320
He's an expert on the latest in weapons and equipment technology.

3589
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:40,480
He'll be going up against some of the world's most advanced weaponry when you infiltrate the research facility.

3590
02:45:41,120 --> 02:45:43,120
If you have any questions, just ask him.

3591
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:47,640
His frequency is 148.41.

3592
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:49,420
Mr. Siggint.

3593
02:45:49,620 --> 02:45:50,220
Got it.

3594
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,280
Mr. Siggint.

3595
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:55,320
Adam, your KGB contact, is waiting for you at the abandoned factory up ahead.

3596
02:45:55,540 --> 02:45:55,620
Okay.

3597
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:58,620
The same factory Sokolov was being held in last week.

3598
02:45:59,020 --> 02:45:59,460
Yes.

3599
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:00,700
Meet up with Adam first.

3600
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:02,900
He's cleared the way for you to rescue Sokolov.

3601
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:05,760
How will I know this Adam guy when I see him?

3602
02:46:06,220 --> 02:46:07,760
You'll know once you reach the factory.

3603
02:46:07,900 --> 02:46:11,460
The whole area's been polluted by the fallout from that nuclear blast.

3604
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:13,720
No one else would dare come close.

3605
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:15,360
The password is...

3606
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:17,080
Who are the Patriots?

3607
02:46:17,180 --> 02:46:18,960
And Lali Lulelo.

3608
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:20,660
Lali Lulelo.

3609
02:46:20,740 --> 02:46:21,320
Gotcha.

3610
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:24,940
You've been equipped with a .45 for this mission.

3611
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:25,640
Be careful.

3612
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:26,560
It's noisy.

3613
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:30,880
I thought standard FOX procedure was procure on-site weapons acquisition.

3614
02:46:31,360 --> 02:46:32,880
The circumstances are different.

3615
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:36,640
You're now on an official mission for the United States government.

3616
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:40,380
It would be necessary to make your presence known to a certain extent.

3617
02:46:40,580 --> 02:46:40,880
Okay.

3618
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:43,220
Stealth is optional.

3619
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:46,480
But remember, this is still a sneaking mission.

3620
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:47,800
Stealth is not optional.

3621
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:50,760
Snake, if you fail this mission, it will mean an all-out nuclear war.

3622
02:46:50,860 --> 02:46:53,900
Keep that in mind and proceed with extreme caution.

3623
02:46:54,300 --> 02:46:54,820
Understood.

3624
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:57,400
Commencing Operation Snake Eater.

3625
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:00,600
Lali Lulelo.

3626
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:00,980
Lali Lulelo.

3627
02:47:00,980 --> 02:47:01,600
Lali Lulelo.

3628
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:04,820
Lali Lulelo.

3629
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:06,160
Stealth is optional.

3630
02:47:07,940 --> 02:47:10,600
Oh my gosh, I wonder what sweet treats are in here.

3631
02:47:10,880 --> 02:47:12,600
Wait, is all my food expired?

3632
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:15,640
All my food was taken!

3633
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:16,600
Oh no!

3634
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:18,260
We never got to try the honey!

3635
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:22,240
Thank you to the chat that gifted me membership.

3636
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:25,000
I love you, pixelated Minto.

3637
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:27,800
I have something else.

3638
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:30,820
Now that Operation Snake Eater has commenced...

3639
02:47:37,050 --> 02:47:40,510
I feel so much... I feel... I feel much better now.

3640
02:47:44,910 --> 02:47:45,770
Cool.

3641
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:50,710
Infinite ammo.

3642
02:47:51,220 --> 02:47:51,930
I wish.

3643
02:47:58,810 --> 02:47:59,670
Mushroom!

3644
02:48:00,870 --> 02:48:03,510
Snake, it's a snake, snake.

3645
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:06,290
Snake, it's a snake.

3646
02:48:07,190 --> 02:48:08,770
I've ordered a calorie mate before.

3647
02:48:08,870 --> 02:48:09,390
Highly recommend.

3648
02:48:09,770 --> 02:48:14,510
Yeah, if you are in a pinch and need some...

3649
02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:18,330
Like a...

3650
02:48:19,330 --> 02:48:22,110
Easy food, calorie mate is... It's a little dry.

3651
02:48:23,150 --> 02:48:24,030
Oh, it's a frog.

3652
02:48:25,710 --> 02:48:26,850
There we go.

3653
02:48:33,730 --> 02:48:34,510
Sorry, frog.

3654
02:48:34,810 --> 02:48:35,930
It's nothing personal.

3655
02:48:36,050 --> 02:48:36,790
It's just, you know...

3656
02:48:36,790 --> 02:48:38,550
Where is Kero-tan here?

3657
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:42,110
You'd think he'd stand out.

3658
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:43,730
This little bright green body.

3659
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:45,510
Kero-tan!

3660
02:48:49,630 --> 02:48:51,830
I'm so sorry if you heard my stomach growling.

3661
02:48:52,150 --> 02:48:54,230
It wasn't snake's stomach, it was mine.

3662
02:48:54,610 --> 02:48:54,910
Oh!

3663
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:56,210
Skeptic!

3664
02:48:57,950 --> 02:49:00,430
Oh my gosh, that was my stomach again.

3665
02:49:06,310 --> 02:49:06,910
Okay.

3666
02:49:09,630 --> 02:49:10,350
This way?

3667
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,780
I should be quiet, shouldn't I?

3668
02:49:16,060 --> 02:49:17,420
There might be guys around.

3669
02:49:17,980 --> 02:49:19,060
I don't remember...

3670
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,320
I don't remember where they start showing up at.

3671
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:27,680
Oh, it's a snake.

3672
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:32,660
I'll take a snack.

3673
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:34,580
With me on the way.

3674
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:38,180
Let's change my camo.

3675
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:38,200
Oh.

3676
02:49:47,350 --> 02:49:47,870
Leaf.

3677
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:52,170
I think black would be the best, because it's night time.

3678
02:49:57,430 --> 02:49:58,990
50% camo.

3679
02:50:01,330 --> 02:50:02,990
Is this a thing I can have?

3680
02:50:05,270 --> 02:50:06,590
I got this diptych.

3681
02:50:07,850 --> 02:50:09,430
I got this disinfectant.

3682
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:14,940
Okay.

3683
02:50:14,940 --> 02:50:16,040
Let's go.

3684
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:18,620
Through the woods.

3685
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:21,700
Okay.

3686
02:50:22,760 --> 02:50:23,240
Oh.

3687
02:50:23,560 --> 02:50:24,560
Before I go...

3688
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:25,940
Well, not that.

3689
02:50:29,060 --> 02:50:29,540
Let's...

3690
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:32,420
Black actually stands out because it doesn't occur in nature.

3691
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:34,400
That's so fair.

3692
02:50:35,740 --> 02:50:36,520
That's so true.

3693
02:50:36,660 --> 02:50:37,080
Paramedic.

3694
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:39,840
Snake, it's so good to hear from you again.

3695
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:40,180
Hello.

3696
02:50:40,580 --> 02:50:41,200
Same here.

3697
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,980
It's been a week, hasn't it?

3698
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:44,420
Four days, actually.

3699
02:50:44,940 --> 02:50:45,080
Oh.

3700
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:45,680
Okay.

3701
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:46,940
Um, actually...

3702
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:47,200
I visited you in the hospital.

3703
02:50:47,480 --> 02:50:48,720
You were still unconscious then.

3704
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:49,480
It's been four days since I see you.

3705
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:51,800
Then you must have seen me naked.

3706
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:56,780
Yeah, but you were all wrapped up in bandages and tubes, so I couldn't do anything but look.

3707
02:50:57,400 --> 02:50:58,700
Better luck next time.

3708
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:00,640
Let's hope so.

3709
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:05,220
But seriously, don't forget that you were like that until just yesterday.

3710
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:07,940
In fact, you really shouldn't even be on this mission.

3711
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:10,380
Keep an eye on your stamina gauge.

3712
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:13,260
If you start to run low, don't push yourself.

3713
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:15,320
Eat something to replenish your stamina.

3714
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:18,120
And try not to get yourself hurt.

3715
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:24,800
If you're wounded or get bitten by a venomous animal, go into the survival viewer immediately and treat yourself using cure.

3716
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:26,300
I'm right here.

3717
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:28,580
I can see you still know how to die.

3718
02:51:28,680 --> 02:51:29,480
I'm right here.

3719
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:29,780
You're welcome.

3720
02:51:29,780 --> 02:51:31,420
Can you guys stop flirting in front of me?

3721
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:32,820
And I can see you still don't know when to keep your mouth shut.

3722
02:51:33,020 --> 02:51:33,220
Ooh!

3723
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:34,400
Maybe so.

3724
02:51:35,180 --> 02:51:36,060
By the way...

3725
02:51:36,060 --> 02:51:36,540
She bites back.

3726
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:39,060
I heard you're going to lose your medical license if this mission fails.

3727
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:40,940
That would suck, wouldn't it?

3728
02:51:40,940 --> 02:51:41,780
Yes, it was talk of that.

3729
02:51:41,860 --> 02:51:43,140
But the mission won't fail.

3730
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:44,120
Will it?

3731
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:45,360
Of course not.

3732
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:46,280
Good.

3733
02:51:46,480 --> 02:51:47,580
I believe in you.

3734
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:48,440
I'm third wheeling.

3735
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:49,000
But you know what?

3736
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:51,380
I really don't care about my medical license.

3737
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:54,720
Didn't they use that to force you to participate in this operation?

3738
02:51:55,500 --> 02:51:56,520
No, I volunteered.

3739
02:51:57,200 --> 02:51:57,680
Why?

3740
02:51:58,360 --> 02:52:00,000
So that I could watch over you.

3741
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:04,500
Snake, you're the best agent I've ever seen.

3742
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,540
But you push yourself too hard.

3743
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:07,280
You're reckless.

3744
02:52:07,880 --> 02:52:08,840
She saw me crawling in that...

3745
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:12,860
Someone has to stop you from getting into trouble to make sure you and the boss don't kill each other.

3746
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:13,060
She saw me crawling in that...

3747
02:52:13,060 --> 02:52:13,120
But you push yourself too hard.

3748
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:16,180
So that's why I volunteered.

3749
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:17,100
You're the best I've ever seen.

3750
02:52:17,300 --> 02:52:20,080
I mean, you couldn't ask for a better guardian angel than me, right?

3751
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:21,200
Good.

3752
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:22,980
Stop right there.

3753
02:52:24,060 --> 02:52:25,840
You can thank me when you get back.

3754
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:27,000
All right.

3755
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:30,300
Everybody is in love with the legend, you guys.

3756
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:31,740
Everybody is in love with the legend.

3757
02:52:32,180 --> 02:52:33,680
Oh, we don't have...

3758
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:36,760
I mean, it would make sense that we don't have the boss anymore.

3759
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:38,640
But it's just sad to not have her there.

3760
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:39,180
You know?

3761
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:39,800
Let's...

3762
02:52:39,800 --> 02:52:40,440
Yo!

3763
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:42,040
You snake, aren't you?

3764
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:42,620
Snake in!

3765
02:52:42,700 --> 02:52:43,100
Snake in!

3766
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:43,160
You snake, don't you think that I'm a little too much of a monster?

3767
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:44,600
None other.

3768
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:48,780
I heard that you're an expert on weapons, equipment and cutting edge technology.

3769
02:52:49,580 --> 02:52:50,060
Close.

3770
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:51,460
Close?

3771
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:53,700
I am the expert on weapons...

3772
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:53,880
Wow!

3773
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:55,540
...equipment and cutting edge technology.

3774
02:52:57,620 --> 02:53:01,580
I'm the guy that designed your tranq gun, active sonar and motion detector.

3775
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:05,060
If you want to know anything about weapons or equipment you find in the field...

3776
02:53:05,060 --> 02:53:06,380
Could you have made it better?

3777
02:53:06,380 --> 02:53:07,680
Just send me a message and ask.

3778
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:08,560
Later.

3779
02:53:09,420 --> 02:53:10,640
He's not a legend yet.

3780
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:11,420
He just got that...

3781
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:12,400
No, he's already a legend.

3782
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:13,100
I'm sorry.

3783
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:14,500
He's already a legend!

3784
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:23,120
Actually, before I do that...

3785
02:53:23,860 --> 02:53:25,920
Have you heard about the Calorie Mate branded game?

3786
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:26,220
Yeah!

3787
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:28,500
I want to play it next week.

3788
02:53:31,860 --> 02:53:35,220
Give a listen to the Tanker Incident Alternative Remix.

3789
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:39,320
I don't know that one, but thank you.

3790
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:40,740
I will give it a listen.

3791
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:41,280
Maybe...

3792
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:44,080
On the Sons of Liberty Complete Soundtrack...

3793
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:46,960
I... do I own that?

3794
02:53:47,300 --> 02:53:48,340
I can't remember.

3795
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:06,720
That's me!

3796
02:54:08,320 --> 02:54:10,580
That's how I feel going into that battle.

3797
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:12,520
And for Unsurpassed Bliss...

3798
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:13,380
The Joy.

3799
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:17,300
It's another name for the boss.

3800
02:54:17,640 --> 02:54:20,220
Because of the joy she feels in battle, I suppose.

3801
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:25,080
During the war, she had a partner named the Sorrow.

3802
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:26,740
Sorrow and Joy.

3803
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:29,460
They say there couldn't have been a more perfect pair.

3804
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:30,260
Opposites attract.

3805
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,640
Are you gonna tell us what happened to the Sorrow?

3806
02:54:34,980 --> 02:54:38,200
The Davy Crockets that the boss took with her when she defected...

3807
02:54:38,200 --> 02:54:40,200
are mortars that fire nuclear warheads.

3808
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:45,640
They're named after Davy Crockets, the hero who died defending the Alamo in the Texan War of Independence.

3809
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:47,720
Remember the Alamo.

3810
02:54:48,380 --> 02:54:49,040
That's right.

3811
02:54:49,220 --> 02:54:50,100
Remember the Alamo.

3812
02:54:50,100 --> 02:54:53,000
The warheads are equivalent to between 10 and 20 tons of TNT.

3813
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,180
Boss in the store, thank you for the tech help!

3814
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:58,700
Every building within 150 yards of the hypocenter is completely obliterated.

3815
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:03,340
But the warheads the boss had with her were some kind of experimental super bomb.

3816
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:06,020
So they're actually even more powerful than that.

3817
02:55:06,460 --> 02:55:09,300
I don't even want to think about what would happen if she used it again.

3818
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:12,000
Snake, you know what you have to do.

3819
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:12,680
What?

3820
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:14,700
Yeah, I know.

3821
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:15,220
I know.

3822
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:19,620
What if I didn't?

3823
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:20,380
What if I didn't?

3824
02:55:20,380 --> 02:55:20,980
What if I didn't?

3825
02:55:20,980 --> 02:55:23,960
Snake, unlike the Virtuous Mission, this is a night operation.

3826
02:55:24,940 --> 02:55:28,600
You'll be encountering nocturnal animals that you didn't encounter your last mission.

3827
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:32,880
Some of them are venomous, like the King Cobra, so be careful.

3828
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:38,920
If you get bitten by a venomous animal, the poison will spread through your body and rapidly drain your life gauge.

3829
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:45,200
If that's the case, go into the cure screen in Survival Viewer immediately and inject yourself with serum.

3830
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:46,040
But can I eat him still?

3831
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:47,080
Got it?

3832
02:55:47,820 --> 02:55:49,000
But can I...

3833
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:52,660
I mean, the venom is stored in the balls.

3834
02:55:53,940 --> 02:55:55,840
All I have to do is cut them out, right?

3835
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:56,080
I see you caught an Ottenfrog.

3836
02:55:56,920 --> 02:55:57,780
An Ottenfrog?

3837
02:55:57,780 --> 02:56:00,140
The Ottenfrog is a large, corpulent species of frog.

3838
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:03,780
They're known as a delicacy, so it might be worth catching them for food.

3839
02:56:05,020 --> 02:56:08,840
The Ottenfrog was originally found only on Amami Oshima in Japan.

3840
02:56:09,800 --> 02:56:15,300
Frogs usually have four toes on their front legs, but the Ottenfrog is unique in that it has five.

3841
02:56:15,500 --> 02:56:16,940
Oh, he's got thumbs!

3842
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:20,700
By the way, you said they were known as a delicacy, right?

3843
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:21,400
You can't say that.

3844
02:56:21,560 --> 02:56:23,060
But isn't that what they all say?

3845
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:24,300
Venom is stored in the balls?

3846
02:56:24,540 --> 02:56:25,260
I guess so.

3847
02:56:25,460 --> 02:56:27,700
It's like the snake balls that you have to cut out.

3848
02:56:27,900 --> 02:56:29,360
I heard that in Japan, Ottenfrog sashimi and sukiyaki are popular dishes.

3849
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:32,540
It's similar to like the fish, the fugu, right?

3850
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:33,920
Japan, huh?

3851
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:36,760
That place is starting to sound better and better.

3852
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:41,240
I forgot that Paramedic's a bit of a weeaboo.

3853
02:56:44,080 --> 02:56:46,880
Oh my gosh, Snake is gonna get into VTubers.

3854
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:50,540
I see you found some Siberian Ink Cap mushrooms.

3855
02:56:51,740 --> 02:56:55,180
The Siberian Ink Cap is a mushroom from the Ink Cap family.

3856
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:57,880
Its life cycle is transitory.

3857
02:56:58,060 --> 02:57:03,600
As soon as the spores mature, the cap starts to turn black, liquefy, and melt away.

3858
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:05,720
And that's why they call it an Ink Cap?

3859
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:06,780
That's right.

3860
02:57:06,780 --> 02:57:10,180
It doesn't really turn to liquid, but you get the idea.

3861
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:10,780
Eww.

3862
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:15,080
In its immature state, before it melts away, it's valued as a source of food.

3863
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:15,780
And afterwards?

3864
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:18,380
Just be sure not to eat them while you're drinking alcohol.

3865
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:19,540
Why's that?

3866
02:57:20,040 --> 02:57:24,740
Ink Caps contain Coprin, which inhibits the function of aldehyde dehydrogenase.

3867
02:57:25,020 --> 02:57:30,220
This prevents the body from breaking down alcohol, causing a buildup of acetaldehyde.

3868
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:31,200
Acetaldehyde.

3869
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:31,500
Meaning?

3870
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:33,540
Speaking English.

3871
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:34,580
Meaning it will be the hangover from hell.

3872
02:57:34,780 --> 02:57:34,980
Oh.

3873
02:57:34,980 --> 02:57:35,480
Oh.

3874
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:37,360
Wait a minute.

3875
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:38,020
What?

3876
02:57:38,360 --> 02:57:40,860
You think I'd drink alcohol in the middle of a mission?

3877
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:41,880
Wouldn't you?

3878
02:57:42,220 --> 02:57:42,860
Hell no.

3879
02:57:43,580 --> 02:57:45,660
Well, I'm knocking a shot back now.

3880
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:46,280
What?

3881
02:57:46,860 --> 02:57:47,300
Paramedic!

3882
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:48,280
Just teasing you.

3883
02:57:50,260 --> 02:57:51,560
Oh, come on.

3884
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:52,740
Where's your sense of humor?

3885
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:54,620
I need a drink.

3886
02:57:57,080 --> 02:57:58,840
Yeah, it's calories, right?

3887
02:57:58,880 --> 02:58:01,240
Well, I mean, as long as it's not like a hard liquor, right?

3888
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:03,740
How about you have like a beer and some calories?

3889
02:58:05,580 --> 02:58:06,780
It's a calorie, mate.

3890
02:58:11,970 --> 02:58:15,530
Snake, king cobras are making their home in the area you're in now.

3891
02:58:16,630 --> 02:58:19,330
The king cobra is the world's largest venomous snake.

3892
02:58:19,570 --> 02:58:22,210
Its large size means that it has a lot of venom to inject.

3893
02:58:22,750 --> 02:58:25,270
One bite is supposedly enough to kill an elephant.

3894
02:58:25,910 --> 02:58:28,030
And it's extremely vicious as well.

3895
02:58:28,210 --> 02:58:28,970
So watch out.

3896
02:58:28,970 --> 02:58:30,210
Wait, did I catch one of these guys?

3897
02:58:30,310 --> 02:58:35,010
If you get bitten by a king cobra and injected with venom, your life will start to decrease rapidly.

3898
02:58:35,290 --> 02:58:36,250
Yeah, you told me that earlier.

3899
02:58:36,250 --> 02:58:40,530
As soon as you're bitten, go into the survival viewer and use cure to give yourself a serum But can I eat it?

3900
02:58:40,770 --> 02:58:41,590
Can I eat it?

3901
02:58:41,950 --> 02:58:44,970
The king cobra's diet consists mostly of other snakes.

3902
02:58:45,010 --> 02:58:46,730
So I just cut it open and eat the inside.

3903
02:58:46,730 --> 02:58:48,050
Be careful, or you might end up as its next meal.

3904
02:58:49,210 --> 02:58:49,810
Got it.

3905
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:51,270
So...

3906
02:58:51,270 --> 02:58:52,050
What?

3907
02:58:52,450 --> 02:58:53,530
How does it taste?

3908
02:58:54,190 --> 02:58:54,670
Yup.

3909
02:58:54,790 --> 02:58:55,050
Yup.

3910
02:58:55,930 --> 02:58:59,130
It seems you're the one whose diet consists of other snakes.

3911
02:58:59,630 --> 02:59:00,990
You're making me blush.

3912
02:59:01,790 --> 02:59:04,090
The guide says they taste just fine.

3913
02:59:05,570 --> 02:59:06,050
What?

3914
02:59:06,190 --> 02:59:06,230
I don't know.

3915
02:59:06,230 --> 02:59:07,890
Why does that make you blush?

3916
02:59:10,950 --> 02:59:11,470
Snake?

3917
02:59:11,530 --> 02:59:12,670
Why does that make you blush?

3918
02:59:14,950 --> 02:59:18,650
Why does her saying that your diet consists of snakes make you blush?

3919
02:59:24,730 --> 02:59:26,250
Snake eater erotic.

3920
02:59:31,270 --> 02:59:32,370
My, my, my.

3921
02:59:33,530 --> 02:59:35,250
Oh, my, my, my.

3922
02:59:35,410 --> 02:59:36,330
Wait, so we do have one?

3923
02:59:37,550 --> 02:59:38,130
Oh, no.

3924
02:59:38,190 --> 02:59:39,270
We got the reticulated python.

3925
02:59:39,550 --> 02:59:40,190
He he he.

3926
02:59:40,830 --> 02:59:41,610
Fairly tasty.

3927
02:59:41,890 --> 02:59:42,410
So...

3928
02:59:42,410 --> 02:59:43,890
It's said to be fairly tasty.

3929
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:46,590
We still haven't eaten our calorie mate yet.

3930
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:54,800
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

3931
02:59:56,180 --> 02:59:57,080
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

3932
02:59:57,800 --> 02:59:58,660
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

3933
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,560
I wonder what this looks like.

3934
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:06,940
I'm curious.

3935
03:00:07,720 --> 03:00:08,460
Oh, my gosh.

3936
03:00:08,520 --> 03:00:10,280
This is the original camera?

3937
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,640
This is the original camera.

3938
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:15,460
No way.

3939
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:16,740
How am I supposed to see in front of me?

3940
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:21,400
Knife.

3941
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:22,000
Knife.

3942
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:26,080
What's over there?

3943
03:00:30,850 --> 03:00:31,510
Let's just go.

3944
03:00:32,670 --> 03:00:34,190
Some people swear by it.

3945
03:00:34,250 --> 03:00:34,850
That's insane.

3946
03:00:35,690 --> 03:00:37,270
Look at that guy in the tree.

3947
03:00:37,790 --> 03:00:41,010
Well, you wouldn't see him unless you...

3948
03:00:41,010 --> 03:00:41,450
Look at...

3949
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:43,550
Horse.

3950
03:00:45,430 --> 03:00:46,430
Wait, I want this guy.

3951
03:00:50,430 --> 03:00:50,870
Yeah.

3952
03:00:55,110 --> 03:00:56,310
I think I have to shoot him.

3953
03:00:56,310 --> 03:00:56,670
I think I have to shoot him, though.

3954
03:01:09,950 --> 03:01:11,190
He looks

3955
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:17,220
tasty.

3956
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:21,400
I don't have a suppressor.

3957
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:25,180
Also, wait.

3958
03:01:26,460 --> 03:01:27,360
This is...

3959
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:29,440
This is not my...

3960
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:30,620
This is not my...

3961
03:01:31,560 --> 03:01:33,620
This is not my tranquilizer?

3962
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:36,680
Now I have a suppressor.

3963
03:01:37,620 --> 03:01:38,240
Okay.

3964
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:38,620
Yeah.

3965
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:39,260
This is lethal.

3966
03:01:40,540 --> 03:01:41,780
I was going to eat it anyway.

3967
03:01:41,920 --> 03:01:46,440
If you're playing the original camera, you're going to have to get well acquainted with those binoculars.

3968
03:01:46,840 --> 03:01:48,420
No, I like to just see it sometimes.

3969
03:01:53,550 --> 03:01:53,950
Sayonara.

3970
03:01:55,830 --> 03:01:57,130
I think anybody heard that?

3971
03:02:04,750 --> 03:02:05,150
No.

3972
03:02:06,830 --> 03:02:07,230
Okay.

3973
03:02:07,310 --> 03:02:07,470
Good.

3974
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:11,450
I was worried it would scare away the horns.

3975
03:02:12,510 --> 03:02:12,910
Peter.

3976
03:02:13,750 --> 03:02:14,950
The horse is here.

3977
03:02:15,370 --> 03:02:15,770
The horse is here.

3978
03:02:17,650 --> 03:02:19,730
Oh, that's my...

3979
03:02:27,030 --> 03:02:28,330
That's a horse.

3980
03:02:28,750 --> 03:02:30,390
Oh, my holy frame rate.

3981
03:02:37,250 --> 03:02:37,890
Peter.

3982
03:02:44,370 --> 03:02:46,670
Looks like death wasn't ready for you yet.

3983
03:02:49,470 --> 03:02:50,110
Boss.

3984
03:02:52,530 --> 03:02:53,170
Boss.

3985
03:02:53,170 --> 03:02:53,490
Boss.

3986
03:02:53,610 --> 03:02:54,250
Boss.

3987
03:02:54,270 --> 03:02:55,270
That arm still hurt?

3988
03:02:55,410 --> 03:02:55,790
Yeah.

3989
03:02:57,710 --> 03:02:58,690
It's a little weak.

3990
03:03:00,010 --> 03:03:01,190
What are you doing here?

3991
03:03:03,630 --> 03:03:04,110
Oh.

3992
03:03:05,770 --> 03:03:06,970
Oh, my gosh.

3993
03:03:06,990 --> 03:03:08,390
Your outfit is so awesome.

3994
03:03:09,830 --> 03:03:10,490
Oh, gosh.

3995
03:03:10,770 --> 03:03:11,370
Come on.

3996
03:03:11,370 --> 03:03:11,630
Don't...

3997
03:03:11,630 --> 03:03:13,110
Oh, I just got out of the hospital.

3998
03:03:13,170 --> 03:03:13,370
Please.

3999
03:03:14,130 --> 03:03:14,610
Please.

4000
03:03:15,430 --> 03:03:16,290
Please, Mommy.

4001
03:03:16,910 --> 03:03:17,810
Mommy, I just...

4002
03:03:17,810 --> 03:03:18,450
No.

4003
03:03:19,630 --> 03:03:20,470
Go home.

4004
03:03:21,350 --> 03:03:21,830
Okay.

4005
03:03:23,070 --> 03:03:23,550
Okay.

4006
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:24,250
Okay.

4007
03:03:27,870 --> 03:03:28,750
Go home.

4008
03:03:29,010 --> 03:03:30,830
Gru and my sons are waiting up ahead.

4009
03:03:32,430 --> 03:03:34,910
You don't have a prayer of finishing your mission.

4010
03:03:35,070 --> 03:03:36,110
You're not even armed.

4011
03:03:36,330 --> 03:03:36,370
I...

4012
03:03:36,370 --> 03:03:37,110
You just took...

4013
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:37,850
Yeah, I was.

4014
03:03:40,030 --> 03:03:40,510
Boss.

4015
03:03:40,510 --> 03:03:41,030
I have a knife.

4016
03:03:47,490 --> 03:03:48,970
Snake, you're too hasty.

4017
03:03:49,010 --> 03:03:49,330
Oh.

4018
03:03:51,590 --> 03:03:52,070
Oh.

4019
03:03:53,170 --> 03:03:54,910
He can't think straight with her.

4020
03:03:55,130 --> 03:03:56,490
I'm not your boss anymore.

4021
03:03:56,950 --> 03:03:57,230
Oh.

4022
03:03:57,310 --> 03:03:57,690
Oh, my gosh.

4023
03:03:57,690 --> 03:03:57,710
Oh, my gosh.

4024
03:03:59,370 --> 03:03:59,910
You're not even armed.

4025
03:03:59,910 --> 03:04:00,970
There's nothing for you here.

4026
03:04:01,110 --> 03:04:01,650
No.

4027
03:04:01,710 --> 03:04:01,950
Ugh.

4028
03:04:03,170 --> 03:04:04,190
Go home.

4029
03:04:04,290 --> 03:04:04,930
Go home.

4030
03:04:05,070 --> 03:04:05,910
Go back to your boss.

4031
03:04:07,190 --> 03:04:07,730
No.

4032
03:04:07,810 --> 03:04:10,110
There's no need to prove that you are virtuous here.

4033
03:04:10,130 --> 03:04:10,530
I'm a patriot.

4034
03:04:11,970 --> 03:04:13,250
This isn't America.

4035
03:04:18,610 --> 03:04:19,150
No!

4036
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:29,260
You said go home!

4037
03:04:29,700 --> 03:04:30,240
How...

4038
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:31,360
How do I go home now?

4039
03:04:31,420 --> 03:04:31,520
Oww!

4040
03:04:40,420 --> 03:04:42,620
Oh, cool-a-bara, cool-a-bara.

4041
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:47,620
Ooooooh!

4042
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:08,420
What about you, Jack?

4043
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:11,840
What's it going to be?

4044
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:14,720
Loyalty to your country or loyalty to me?

4045
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:17,120
Your country or your old mentor?

4046
03:05:17,380 --> 03:05:18,900
The mission or your beliefs?

4047
03:05:19,500 --> 03:05:22,540
Your duty to your unit or your personal feelings?

4048
03:05:30,550 --> 03:05:32,190
You don't know the truth yet.

4049
03:05:32,990 --> 03:05:35,070
But sooner or later you'll have to choose.

4050
03:05:36,630 --> 03:05:37,150
Choose...

4051
03:05:38,470 --> 03:05:39,830
I don't expect you to choose.

4052
03:05:39,830 --> 03:05:40,390
Don't you want to forgive me?

4053
03:05:45,090 --> 03:05:46,990
But you can't defeat me either.

4054
03:05:48,250 --> 03:05:49,630
You know me too well.

4055
03:05:54,850 --> 03:05:56,690
Just look at that bandana.

4056
03:05:56,830 --> 03:05:59,850
If you can't put the past behind you, you won't survive long.

4057
03:06:01,990 --> 03:06:03,250
Why you gotta call me out?

4058
03:06:03,750 --> 03:06:05,250
Why you gotta call me out, boss?

4059
03:06:06,350 --> 03:06:08,750
If we meet again, I'll kill you.

4060
03:06:09,830 --> 03:06:10,610
You wouldn't...

4061
03:06:13,870 --> 03:06:15,190
Now, go home.

4062
03:06:20,500 --> 03:06:20,960
Boss!

4063
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:24,320
Uh-oh.

4064
03:06:24,380 --> 03:06:25,240
The guys are coming.

4065
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:28,540
They heard the explosion.

4066
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:29,820
They heard me shoot a snake.

4067
03:06:32,140 --> 03:06:33,400
This is Snake.

4068
03:06:33,820 --> 03:06:34,560
Major Zero.

4069
03:06:34,940 --> 03:06:35,880
I read you, Snake.

4070
03:06:36,100 --> 03:06:37,680
I was ambushed by the boss.

4071
03:06:37,820 --> 03:06:38,700
He sounds so calm.

4072
03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:40,120
The drone's been shot to hell.

4073
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:41,300
It's up in flames.

4074
03:06:41,580 --> 03:06:41,980
Yeah...

4075
03:06:41,980 --> 03:06:42,360
That's not good.

4076
03:06:42,460 --> 03:06:43,860
Enemy scouts are gonna come looking for you.

4077
03:06:43,860 --> 03:06:45,020
Yeah, I know.

4078
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:47,800
But what was the boss doing here in the first place?

4079
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:49,340
There's gotta be a leak somewhere.

4080
03:06:49,940 --> 03:06:50,500
That's impossible.

4081
03:06:50,900 --> 03:06:54,720
The man the boss is working with, Volgin, isn't exactly on speaking terms with Khrushchev.

4082
03:06:54,880 --> 03:06:55,880
I lost my gun.

4083
03:06:56,140 --> 03:06:57,500
The boss destroyed it.

4084
03:06:57,640 --> 03:06:59,420
Snake, I know how you're feeling.

4085
03:06:59,960 --> 03:07:04,600
It's hard for me to believe, too, that a legendary hero like the boss would go over to the Russians.

4086
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:06,860
But she double-crossed us like this.

4087
03:07:06,860 --> 03:07:07,820
She double-crossed us.

4088
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:11,140
That's how it is, and if you don't accept it, you'll never be able to beat her.

4089
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:12,320
That's not the problem.

4090
03:07:12,320 --> 03:07:15,620
In terms of sheer technique, I'll never be able to beat her.

4091
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:17,360
I know the boss very well.

4092
03:07:17,360 --> 03:07:18,320
Who took that picture?

4093
03:07:18,460 --> 03:07:19,040
You've got to do it, Snake.

4094
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:19,380
She's your enemy and your objective.

4095
03:07:19,380 --> 03:07:21,980
Oh my gosh, the embarrassing photo from the Christmas party!

4096
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:25,800
If we were together for ten years, and now you tell me she's my enemy?

4097
03:07:26,060 --> 03:07:26,380
Enough.

4098
03:07:26,900 --> 03:07:28,740
Hurry to the factory where Adam is waiting.

4099
03:07:29,420 --> 03:07:32,100
Scouts have probably already been sent out to investigate the explosion.

4100
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:32,740
Who took that?

4101
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:34,020
You've lost your weapon, right?

4102
03:07:34,240 --> 03:07:36,840
That means you've got no chance of winning in a battle situation.

4103
03:07:37,420 --> 03:07:39,700
Whatever you do, don't let them see you.

4104
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:40,200
Okay.

4105
03:07:41,660 --> 03:07:42,060
Okay.

4106
03:07:42,060 --> 03:07:42,140
Okay.

4107
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:51,600
They're on their way, so let's move over and not let them see me.

4108
03:07:57,490 --> 03:07:58,690
Which way did they come?

4109
03:07:58,850 --> 03:07:59,790
They come from that way, right?

4110
03:08:04,030 --> 03:08:04,650
Is there a...

4111
03:08:08,530 --> 03:08:09,910
At the same time!

4112
03:08:12,430 --> 03:08:12,830
Okay.

4113
03:08:17,440 --> 03:08:17,840
HQ?

4114
03:08:18,300 --> 03:08:18,420
HQ?

4115
03:08:18,920 --> 03:08:19,060
HQ?

4116
03:08:20,100 --> 03:08:20,740
This is HQ.

4117
03:08:20,980 --> 03:08:21,420
HQ?

4118
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:22,280
HQ?

4119
03:08:22,680 --> 03:08:23,140
Control here.

4120
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:26,340
We have evidence of an enemy intruder.

4121
03:08:26,420 --> 03:08:26,700
Uh oh.

4122
03:08:26,880 --> 03:08:27,120
Alert formation.

4123
03:08:29,300 --> 03:08:31,280
Alert music is so awesome.

4124
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:34,060
Love caution music.

4125
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:43,260
Wait, I can't see anything.

4126
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:45,280
What was it?

4127
03:08:47,180 --> 03:08:49,420
How do I lift up my head again?

4128
03:08:51,560 --> 03:08:52,620
I can't remember.

4129
03:08:52,780 --> 03:08:54,180
What was the control to lift up my head?

4130
03:08:54,740 --> 03:08:55,700
To peak up?

4131
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:57,160
Uh.

4132
03:08:59,860 --> 03:09:00,540
L2, R2.

4133
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:02,580
Oh.

4134
03:09:07,210 --> 03:09:08,010
L1, R1?

4135
03:09:13,110 --> 03:09:13,970
L1, R1.

4136
03:09:14,150 --> 03:09:14,270
L1, R1.

4137
03:09:14,270 --> 03:09:16,290
Maybe it's different than... from the HD.

4138
03:09:21,980 --> 03:09:22,940
Not working.

4139
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:24,380
Yeah, at the same time...

4140
03:09:25,380 --> 03:09:27,060
I wish I could see them.

4141
03:09:31,110 --> 03:09:32,090
Where's the other guy?

4142
03:09:32,270 --> 03:09:32,710
Oh, there he is.

4143
03:09:43,330 --> 03:09:44,710
I don't want to get shot.

4144
03:09:46,130 --> 03:09:47,330
Up on the D-pad.

4145
03:09:48,330 --> 03:09:49,010
Oh my god!

4146
03:09:49,130 --> 03:09:49,850
No, no!

4147
03:09:51,590 --> 03:09:53,010
That made me go forward.

4148
03:09:53,290 --> 03:09:53,910
It's okay though.

4149
03:09:55,930 --> 03:09:57,110
Where did the other guy go?

4150
03:09:57,390 --> 03:09:58,270
You're walking away too far!

4151
03:10:00,290 --> 03:10:01,870
I'm afraid to walk over there now.

4152
03:10:02,270 --> 03:10:04,330
Because I think the other guy is going to come over.

4153
03:10:04,510 --> 03:10:04,910
Yeah, see?

4154
03:10:08,870 --> 03:10:09,830
There's two of them!

4155
03:10:11,490 --> 03:10:12,290
Sense of win!

4156
03:10:12,970 --> 03:10:13,710
Oh my gosh.

4157
03:10:19,750 --> 03:10:20,990
Where did you all come from?

4158
03:10:26,850 --> 03:10:28,010
Are they going to turn around?

4159
03:10:29,890 --> 03:10:32,690
I want

4160
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:37,500
to CQC them.

4161
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:39,940
I want to just run and CQC them, you know?

4162
03:10:40,280 --> 03:10:41,040
But I'm scared.

4163
03:10:43,960 --> 03:10:45,460
Alright, now's my chance.

4164
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:49,020
Where?

4165
03:10:49,020 --> 03:10:49,040
Who was that?

4166
03:11:09,470 --> 03:11:10,330
There's another guy?

4167
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:23,690
Oh, I think they saw me.

4168
03:11:25,690 --> 03:11:27,030
Just a runaway snake.

4169
03:11:42,360 --> 03:11:43,960
At least the BGM is cool.

4170
03:11:46,100 --> 03:11:46,660
It's okay.

4171
03:11:46,740 --> 03:11:49,420
They barely even noticed me, probably.

4172
03:11:50,800 --> 03:11:51,600
Am I okay?

4173
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:52,120
Look!

4174
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:54,280
I didn't even get hurt!

4175
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:58,000
Look at this.

4176
03:11:58,580 --> 03:12:01,040
We're a beautiful, healthy boy!

4177
03:12:04,630 --> 03:12:05,390
Everything's fine!

4178
03:12:05,930 --> 03:12:07,210
With all our bones!

4179
03:12:08,210 --> 03:12:12,770
We got... okay, I know it's bigger than that.

4180
03:12:13,270 --> 03:12:13,890
Come on.

4181
03:12:14,270 --> 03:12:15,310
Don't lie to me.

4182
03:12:16,990 --> 03:12:19,830
Okay, let's just keep going.

4183
03:12:19,830 --> 03:12:20,490
What'd they do to you?

4184
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:28,520
Let's just keep going.

4185
03:12:36,780 --> 03:12:40,580
I still can't... I want to remember what the controls are.

4186
03:12:46,290 --> 03:12:46,850
HQ.

4187
03:12:47,190 --> 03:12:47,830
Please respond.

4188
03:12:49,070 --> 03:12:50,110
This is HQ.

4189
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:51,150
This is so sad.

4190
03:12:51,650 --> 03:12:52,590
Patrol here.

4191
03:12:53,850 --> 03:12:55,470
We've lost sight of the intruder.

4192
03:12:55,610 --> 03:12:56,750
We're going into a higher level...

4193
03:12:56,750 --> 03:12:57,190
HQ.

4194
03:12:57,470 --> 03:12:58,470
Please respond.

4195
03:12:58,630 --> 03:13:00,330
The enemy is still nearby.

4196
03:13:00,630 --> 03:13:01,810
Pursue and engage him.

4197
03:13:02,070 --> 03:13:02,630
HQ.

4198
03:13:02,810 --> 03:13:03,530
Please respond.

4199
03:13:10,970 --> 03:13:15,430
Please give me a sign that you're here.

4200
03:13:16,830 --> 03:13:18,870
They don't come up here, right?

4201
03:13:19,070 --> 03:13:19,890
I don't think they can.

4202
03:13:24,110 --> 03:13:26,690
What's the CQC that makes you like...

4203
03:13:26,690 --> 03:13:30,050
Is it like you run up to them and then slam their head on the ground?

4204
03:13:30,310 --> 03:13:30,830
You know?

4205
03:13:34,050 --> 03:13:35,210
What is that one?

4206
03:13:35,430 --> 03:13:36,870
That CQC...

4207
03:13:47,490 --> 03:13:48,630
Tilted stick plus circle.

4208
03:13:48,910 --> 03:13:49,690
Okay, okay, okay.

4209
03:13:50,850 --> 03:13:51,670
Hold and direction.

4210
03:13:51,890 --> 03:13:52,430
Okay, okay, okay.

4211
03:13:52,630 --> 03:13:54,710
That's what I thought I was doing.

4212
03:13:54,850 --> 03:13:55,550
But you know me.

4213
03:13:56,810 --> 03:13:58,090
You know me!

4214
03:13:59,810 --> 03:14:02,890
If I'm given a command, I'll mess it up.

4215
03:14:05,390 --> 03:14:07,130
You know me!

4216
03:14:08,670 --> 03:14:10,890
If I'm told to do anything...

4217
03:14:10,950 --> 03:14:12,190
Oh, I could have done the bees.

4218
03:14:13,310 --> 03:14:14,670
I could have done the bees.

4219
03:14:15,930 --> 03:14:17,030
Let's put our...

4220
03:14:20,350 --> 03:14:21,870
She took my gun!

4221
03:14:31,930 --> 03:14:33,230
She broke my gun.

4222
03:14:33,290 --> 03:14:33,710
I forgot.

4223
03:14:38,790 --> 03:14:39,270
Boys!

4224
03:14:40,810 --> 03:14:42,810
Boys, how could you do this to me?

4225
03:14:42,990 --> 03:14:44,850
I see that there's like a dude over there.

4226
03:14:45,750 --> 03:14:46,790
Okay, so we got him.

4227
03:14:47,870 --> 03:14:49,930
And we got Fancy.

4228
03:14:49,930 --> 03:14:50,030
And we got Fancy.

4229
03:14:50,710 --> 03:14:51,710
McGee over there.

4230
03:14:53,950 --> 03:14:55,930
I see you through the blades of grass.

4231
03:14:57,830 --> 03:14:59,230
And then we had another friend.

4232
03:15:00,110 --> 03:15:01,310
Is that the other friend?

4233
03:15:02,110 --> 03:15:02,670
Yeah.

4234
03:15:03,470 --> 03:15:05,570
Whoa, looking pretty wobbly there!

4235
03:15:05,890 --> 03:15:07,150
You better watch out!

4236
03:15:09,890 --> 03:15:10,970
You better...

4237
03:15:10,970 --> 03:15:12,450
You better watch out!

4238
03:15:15,930 --> 03:15:16,890
Don't trip!

4239
03:15:17,230 --> 03:15:17,570
You know?

4240
03:15:19,930 --> 03:15:20,750
Pretty scary there.

4241
03:15:20,830 --> 03:15:21,310
Pretty scary.

4242
03:15:38,080 --> 03:15:38,880
Don't see me.

4243
03:15:39,180 --> 03:15:42,300
HQ, please respond.

4244
03:15:43,820 --> 03:15:44,260
Alright.

4245
03:15:49,140 --> 03:15:50,420
Let's try it on this guy then.

4246
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:53,360
Just this guy, I think, here?

4247
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:58,480
Oh wait, no, there's two of them.

4248
03:15:58,600 --> 03:15:59,440
Okay, they both...

4249
03:16:00,380 --> 03:16:01,600
How do I want to do this?

4250
03:16:03,280 --> 03:16:04,520
How do I want to do this?

4251
03:16:06,120 --> 03:16:06,480
HQ...

4252
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:08,740
HQ, please respond.

4253
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:10,920
HQ...

4254
03:16:11,520 --> 03:16:12,620
HQ, please say something.

4255
03:16:20,530 --> 03:16:21,770
I think he'll notice me here.

4256
03:16:22,530 --> 03:16:23,770
My camouflage is 65.

4257
03:16:31,030 --> 03:16:33,370
But, oh wait, he's gonna like walk in this spot though, isn't he?

4258
03:16:33,370 --> 03:16:33,470
I think he's gonna like walk in this spot though, isn't he?

4259
03:16:34,570 --> 03:16:35,030
I think he's gonna like walk in this spot though, isn't he?

4260
03:16:35,030 --> 03:16:36,070
Okay, let's go a little further back.

4261
03:16:38,390 --> 03:16:39,170
Like right here.

4262
03:16:44,410 --> 03:16:44,790
HQ...

4263
03:16:44,790 --> 03:16:46,130
HQ, I'm lonely.

4264
03:16:48,210 --> 03:16:48,590
HQ...

4265
03:16:51,590 --> 03:16:52,550
I could do the B.

4266
03:16:52,670 --> 03:16:53,650
Oh, I can't do the B.

4267
03:16:53,670 --> 03:16:55,490
I don't have a gun anymore, you guys.

4268
03:16:57,050 --> 03:16:57,810
I can't.

4269
03:16:57,810 --> 03:16:59,070
I don't have a gun.

4270
03:17:01,930 --> 03:17:02,890
Run, be bold.

4271
03:17:03,150 --> 03:17:03,530
Okay.

4272
03:17:04,110 --> 03:17:05,370
This is where we'll practice.

4273
03:17:05,990 --> 03:17:08,110
Well, I don't want to prac- I want him to turn around.

4274
03:17:09,330 --> 03:17:10,090
Well, I don't want to prac- I want him to turn around.

4275
03:17:10,090 --> 03:17:12,310
I want him to turn around.

4276
03:17:12,530 --> 03:17:13,930
But we're gonna do it.

4277
03:17:14,030 --> 03:17:16,690
We're gonna run up on him and slam him.

4278
03:17:17,190 --> 03:17:17,690
We're gonna run up on him and slam him.

4279
03:17:17,690 --> 03:17:18,430
We're gonna put him in the slammer.

4280
03:17:19,030 --> 03:17:19,570
For real.

4281
03:17:19,750 --> 03:17:20,110
Probably.

4282
03:17:24,650 --> 03:17:25,510
Knife the bridge.

4283
03:17:25,970 --> 03:17:30,190
You know, I totally thought about that and then I was like, Wait, how do I... how will I get across?

4284
03:17:30,770 --> 03:17:31,290
Wait, how do I...

4285
03:17:31,290 --> 03:17:31,290
how will I get across?

4286
03:17:35,470 --> 03:17:37,310
He's slowly making his way.

4287
03:17:37,710 --> 03:17:38,070
He's slowly making his way.

4288
03:17:40,610 --> 03:17:41,010
Surely.

4289
03:17:46,770 --> 03:17:49,790
I could dangle on the bridge.

4290
03:17:49,990 --> 03:17:52,130
That is a thing that you can do.

4291
03:17:53,050 --> 03:17:53,450
That is a thing that you can do.

4292
03:17:53,450 --> 03:17:55,030
But, um, I'm so scared.

4293
03:17:55,730 --> 03:17:56,330
But, um, I'm so scared.

4294
03:17:57,170 --> 03:17:59,250
They're gonna see- they're gonna step on my fingers.

4295
03:18:00,310 --> 03:18:01,810
I've been through it, okay guys?

4296
03:18:02,010 --> 03:18:02,370
Come on.

4297
03:18:04,490 --> 03:18:07,290
It's gonna take me a minute to get used to controls and stuff.

4298
03:18:07,370 --> 03:18:09,930
So please, just, you know, sorry if I...

4299
03:18:11,890 --> 03:18:12,930
I'm a little slow.

4300
03:18:13,110 --> 03:18:14,250
Especially with this game.

4301
03:18:15,490 --> 03:18:15,970
I'm a little slow.

4302
03:18:17,050 --> 03:18:17,530
Especially with this game.

4303
03:18:17,850 --> 03:18:19,090
Oh, he doesn't see me.

4304
03:18:19,350 --> 03:18:20,670
I'm a master of stealth.

4305
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:26,560
Oh!

4306
03:18:26,560 --> 03:18:26,960
Oh!

4307
03:18:27,860 --> 03:18:28,340
Oh!

4308
03:18:29,900 --> 03:18:30,380
There.

4309
03:18:33,880 --> 03:18:34,720
No one's there!

4310
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:39,000
I only took a little hit.

4311
03:18:39,260 --> 03:18:39,480
I only took a little hit.

4312
03:18:41,100 --> 03:18:42,440
He shot me just a little bit.

4313
03:18:42,680 --> 03:18:42,860
He shot me just a little bit.

4314
03:18:46,440 --> 03:18:46,540
Run!

4315
03:18:46,740 --> 03:18:47,620
Be bold!

4316
03:18:48,260 --> 03:18:49,000
Be brave!

4317
03:18:49,980 --> 03:18:52,600
Bold and brave, I'm bold and brave.

4318
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,460
He's so...

4319
03:18:54,460 --> 03:18:54,900
brave.

4320
03:18:59,050 --> 03:19:00,570
He's unafraid.

4321
03:19:01,390 --> 03:19:04,230
She is well behaved.

4322
03:19:13,410 --> 03:19:14,570
Where's the other guy?

4323
03:19:33,550 --> 03:19:34,450
Thank you!

4324
03:19:35,010 --> 03:19:35,890
Bye bye!

4325
03:19:43,930 --> 03:19:46,130
He came out of nowhere!

4326
03:19:49,930 --> 03:19:52,130
This is how you do easy mode.

4327
03:19:55,810 --> 03:19:57,750
I'm not playing on easy mode.

4328
03:19:58,610 --> 03:20:00,770
I'm playing on normal.

4329
03:20:07,090 --> 03:20:09,650
We can have a little bullet as a treat.

4330
03:20:09,910 --> 03:20:10,990
Yeah, we're still fine.

4331
03:20:12,010 --> 03:20:13,050
Everything is good.

4332
03:20:13,370 --> 03:20:14,870
Our body is stronger.

4333
03:20:14,870 --> 03:20:15,330
Stronger.

4334
03:20:20,210 --> 03:20:21,570
Oh yes, Sokolov.

4335
03:20:21,870 --> 03:20:22,310
Area.

4336
03:20:28,410 --> 03:20:29,570
I hear footsteps.

4337
03:20:30,450 --> 03:20:31,650
But I see no one.

4338
03:20:32,270 --> 03:20:34,210
Gosh, I wish I could crouch walk right now.

4339
03:20:37,710 --> 03:20:39,070
Or maybe I didn't hear footsteps.

4340
03:20:39,210 --> 03:20:39,790
Am I crazy?

4341
03:20:42,990 --> 03:20:44,570
I mean, why would there be people here?

4342
03:20:45,870 --> 03:20:47,210
Why are there people here anyway?

4343
03:20:47,550 --> 03:20:48,690
There's no reason for it.

4344
03:20:49,410 --> 03:20:50,470
There's nothing here anymore.

4345
03:20:51,730 --> 03:20:51,830
You know?

4346
03:20:54,130 --> 03:20:55,790
Who are the Patriots?

4347
03:20:55,910 --> 03:20:56,710
Where are the Patriots?

4348
03:20:58,310 --> 03:20:59,030
Who's there?

4349
03:20:59,670 --> 03:21:00,230
Adam?

4350
03:21:02,050 --> 03:21:02,610
Nope.

4351
03:21:02,810 --> 03:21:03,810
Just a snake.

4352
03:21:04,570 --> 03:21:07,130
Snake is microdosing bullets to build his immunity.

4353
03:21:09,230 --> 03:21:09,790
Obviously.

4354
03:21:14,470 --> 03:21:16,510
A locker where I found Sokolov.

4355
03:21:20,030 --> 03:21:21,270
That is true.

4356
03:21:21,330 --> 03:21:22,490
I did not go through the locker.

4357
03:21:26,900 --> 03:21:28,700
I realized that after we left.

4358
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:30,240
I was like, oh I didn't open the lockers.

4359
03:21:36,570 --> 03:21:37,830
Can I even open these?

4360
03:21:41,910 --> 03:21:42,310
No?

4361
03:21:43,290 --> 03:21:43,690
No?

4362
03:21:44,870 --> 03:21:45,710
Thanks for the gift!

4363
03:21:47,830 --> 03:21:48,990
Thank you so much!

4364
03:21:52,370 --> 03:21:53,770
It's in his room though, right?

4365
03:21:54,230 --> 03:21:56,350
But I just wanted to see if I could open these ones.

4366
03:21:58,830 --> 03:22:01,130
I hope there's no one in here.

4367
03:22:03,270 --> 03:22:04,110
There we go.

4368
03:22:04,310 --> 03:22:05,030
In here?

4369
03:22:07,470 --> 03:22:09,090
I wonder what these could be.

4370
03:22:09,310 --> 03:22:10,870
I hope it's something I really love.

4371
03:22:11,130 --> 03:22:15,890
Definitely hope it's not any thermal or night vision goggles or any of the variety.

4372
03:22:17,490 --> 03:22:18,030
Ahhh!

4373
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:30,580
I hate you guys.

4374
03:22:30,780 --> 03:22:32,200
I hate you guys!

4375
03:22:32,200 --> 03:22:32,840
I hate you guys!

4376
03:22:36,280 --> 03:22:38,480
Time to take a nice little nap.

4377
03:22:45,450 --> 03:22:49,670
Adam is a spy sent by the KGB to infiltrate Volgin's ranks.

4378
03:22:49,750 --> 03:22:50,090
Right.

4379
03:22:50,170 --> 03:22:52,830
You'll need to be extremely careful in how you approach him.

4380
03:22:53,010 --> 03:22:54,850
If you have thermal goggles, my Oshii!

4381
03:22:55,210 --> 03:22:56,410
You can't let Volgin know he's meeting me.

4382
03:22:56,850 --> 03:22:57,390
That's right.

4383
03:22:58,510 --> 03:23:01,150
Adam won't show up if you're being pursued by the enemy.

4384
03:23:01,230 --> 03:23:01,510
Okay.

4385
03:23:01,510 --> 03:23:05,150
Before you go to rendezvous with Adam, make sure you haven't been seen by the enemy.

4386
03:23:05,150 --> 03:23:05,890
I took care of that.

4387
03:23:06,010 --> 03:23:06,370
Don't worry.

4388
03:23:06,550 --> 03:23:08,010
Meet up with him in normal phase.

4389
03:23:10,130 --> 03:23:11,330
I'm never normal!

4390
03:23:11,770 --> 03:23:13,390
Major, what am I supposed to do?

4391
03:23:15,370 --> 03:23:17,790
I see you caught yourself a green tree python.

4392
03:23:18,010 --> 03:23:18,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4393
03:23:19,150 --> 03:23:22,270
The green tree python isn't venomous, so no need to worry.

4394
03:23:22,470 --> 03:23:25,670
It's fairly docile too, so I don't think it's likely to attack you.

4395
03:23:26,650 --> 03:23:29,390
The green tree python originally comes from Australia and New Zealand.

4396
03:23:29,390 --> 03:23:30,090
Just be normal.

4397
03:23:31,510 --> 03:23:32,830
You're literally telling me to just be normal.

4398
03:23:33,810 --> 03:23:34,770
Oh my god.

4399
03:23:35,050 --> 03:23:35,610
What?

4400
03:23:36,050 --> 03:23:36,050
What?

4401
03:23:36,050 --> 03:23:36,470
What?

4402
03:23:36,630 --> 03:23:38,710
Snake, what did I just say?

4403
03:23:39,210 --> 03:23:41,590
They come from Australia and New Zealand.

4404
03:23:42,010 --> 03:23:43,210
No, after that.

4405
03:23:43,590 --> 03:23:45,670
They're a really pretty green color.

4406
03:23:46,030 --> 03:23:48,210
You'll see my stream moments later.

4407
03:23:48,250 --> 03:23:49,230
Sorry, Terpius!

4408
03:23:49,670 --> 03:23:51,230
Seeing a snake and calling it pretty?

4409
03:23:51,650 --> 03:23:52,730
What's wrong with that?

4410
03:23:52,790 --> 03:23:53,110
Just checking.

4411
03:23:53,630 --> 03:23:54,190
Everything.

4412
03:23:54,490 --> 03:23:58,870
When a normal woman sees a snake, she's supposed to scream or get sick or something like that.

4413
03:23:59,170 --> 03:23:59,250
XP and Rayford, North Carolina.

4414
03:23:59,250 --> 03:24:01,010
They do outdoor skydiving.

4415
03:24:01,510 --> 03:24:02,290
Thank you.

4416
03:24:03,490 --> 03:24:04,890
I will check them out.

4417
03:24:04,890 --> 03:24:05,530
It's all your fault.

4418
03:24:06,430 --> 03:24:07,650
Geez, I'm sorry.

4419
03:24:08,150 --> 03:24:09,310
But enough of that.

4420
03:24:09,630 --> 03:24:10,950
What do you mean enough of that?

4421
03:24:11,010 --> 03:24:11,790
This is serious.

4422
03:24:12,330 --> 03:24:15,630
No, I just wanted you to tell me how it tastes.

4423
03:24:15,990 --> 03:24:16,950
How should I know?

4424
03:24:18,690 --> 03:24:20,890
It was awfully pretty though.

4425
03:24:23,270 --> 03:24:24,610
Okay, paramedic, you okay?

4426
03:24:25,830 --> 03:24:28,610
You're wearing the tiger stripe pattern camouflage, huh?

4427
03:24:28,850 --> 03:24:29,130
Yeah.

4428
03:24:29,650 --> 03:24:31,450
Tiger stripe is a forest camouflage.

4429
03:24:31,770 --> 03:24:31,930
Wait.

4430
03:24:32,110 --> 03:24:35,730
As you may have guessed by the name, it mimics the stripe pattern on a tiger's coat.

4431
03:24:36,290 --> 03:24:39,030
It was originally worn by South Vietnamese Marines.

4432
03:24:39,370 --> 03:24:39,810
Wait.

4433
03:24:39,810 --> 03:24:41,850
Then it caught the attention of an American military advisor.

4434
03:24:41,850 --> 03:24:42,830
If I take off my clothes...

4435
03:24:42,830 --> 03:24:46,190
And now they're thinking of introducing it into all kinds of special forces units.

4436
03:24:46,470 --> 03:24:47,250
I hope you guys don't mind.

4437
03:24:47,330 --> 03:24:48,350
I'm gonna eat some cheese.

4438
03:24:48,350 --> 03:24:50,990
But it's like a cheese snack, so it's kinda hard.

4439
03:24:50,990 --> 03:24:51,390
But it's like a cheese snack, so it's kinda hard.

4440
03:24:53,610 --> 03:24:55,210
Hold on, I'm gonna quench, okay?

4441
03:25:01,360 --> 03:25:03,000
Let me take off my clothes.

4442
03:25:10,780 --> 03:25:11,800
Going with the tea.

4443
03:25:18,760 --> 03:25:19,820
Snake, what's up?

4444
03:25:20,220 --> 03:25:21,180
Why are you naked?

4445
03:25:21,460 --> 03:25:25,900
I know there's a naked option under uniform that lets you take off the upper part of your uniform.

4446
03:25:26,460 --> 03:25:26,940
I know there's a naked option under uniform that lets you take off the upper part of your uniform.

4447
03:25:26,940 --> 03:25:27,000
I know there's a naked option under uniform that lets you take off the upper part of your uniform.

4448
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:28,860
But without a shirt on, your camouflage sucks.

4449
03:25:29,060 --> 03:25:30,520
And your stamina goes down faster.

4450
03:25:30,800 --> 03:25:32,460
You don't get any advantages whatsoever.

4451
03:25:32,840 --> 03:25:33,920
No advantages whatsoever.

4452
03:25:34,440 --> 03:25:35,060
Sure there are.

4453
03:25:35,400 --> 03:25:36,080
Like what?

4454
03:25:36,420 --> 03:25:37,500
It feels good.

4455
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:39,700
Man, you do whatever you want.

4456
03:25:40,140 --> 03:25:41,400
I will, thanks.

4457
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:44,180
What?

4458
03:25:44,740 --> 03:25:46,800
Is there a way to take off my pants?

4459
03:25:47,120 --> 03:25:47,780
Say what?

4460
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:49,280
My pants.

4461
03:25:49,320 --> 03:25:49,640
Can I?

4462
03:25:49,700 --> 03:25:50,720
Aw, hell no!

4463
03:25:50,960 --> 03:25:52,640
This fox unit is a nutfest!

4464
03:25:58,320 --> 03:25:58,720
Say what?

4465
03:26:03,140 --> 03:26:03,900
Sorry, say again.

4466
03:26:06,760 --> 03:26:07,700
Sorry, Snake.

4467
03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:09,180
I didn't mean to objectify you.

4468
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:12,840
I like the tree bark.

4469
03:26:13,800 --> 03:26:15,180
I like the colors of it.

4470
03:26:15,760 --> 03:26:17,660
Mint gets naked and eats cheese.

4471
03:26:19,340 --> 03:26:20,120
It's true!

4472
03:26:25,470 --> 03:26:26,770
Oh, I'm sneaky?

4473
03:26:29,190 --> 03:26:31,110
I'm cool, I'm calm, I'm collected.

4474
03:26:36,220 --> 03:26:39,100
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

4475
03:26:39,500 --> 03:26:41,900
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

4476
03:26:43,180 --> 03:26:46,420
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

4477
03:26:46,760 --> 03:26:48,700
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

4478
03:26:49,220 --> 03:26:49,880
R1, R1, R1, R1.

4479
03:26:53,360 --> 03:26:54,060
R1, R1.

4480
03:26:54,060 --> 03:26:54,600
Sorry I'm late.

4481
03:26:55,020 --> 03:26:58,100
Cut the engine, they'll hear us.

4482
03:26:58,240 --> 03:27:00,060
Yeah, cut the- Are you the agent they sent?

4483
03:27:01,180 --> 03:27:02,240
Yes, now cut the engine.

4484
03:27:02,380 --> 03:27:02,460
Adam?

4485
03:27:03,260 --> 03:27:04,940
I thought you were supposed to be a man.

4486
03:27:04,980 --> 03:27:06,300
Adam couldn't make it.

4487
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:07,060
R1, R1.

4488
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:09,980
Alright, say the password.

4489
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:12,120
Who are the Patriots?

4490
03:27:13,820 --> 03:27:15,240
Who are the Patriots?

4491
03:27:15,260 --> 03:27:16,060
Who are the Patriots?

4492
03:27:17,200 --> 03:27:17,920
Who are the Patriots?

4493
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:18,300
Answer me!

4494
03:27:21,380 --> 03:27:22,220
She doesn't know.

4495
03:27:27,520 --> 03:27:28,240
I'm cornered!

4496
03:27:28,380 --> 03:27:29,960
Who are

4497
03:27:47,070 --> 03:27:47,710
the Patriots?

4498
03:27:48,270 --> 03:27:49,490
Who are the Patriots?

4499
03:27:51,370 --> 03:27:52,650
I'm still holding R1.

4500
03:27:52,690 --> 03:27:53,030
I'm ready.

4501
03:27:54,850 --> 03:27:56,310
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

4502
03:27:56,310 --> 03:27:58,910
There is your answer.

4503
03:27:59,230 --> 03:27:59,810
Oh my god.

4504
03:28:00,470 --> 03:28:01,310
Madam?

4505
03:28:01,910 --> 03:28:03,330
He's so impressed.

4506
03:28:04,770 --> 03:28:07,790
He's like, Now that's a woman.

4507
03:28:17,240 --> 03:28:22,680
Oh my gosh.

4508
03:28:23,620 --> 03:28:24,040
R1?

4509
03:28:24,480 --> 03:28:25,320
R1?

4510
03:28:25,940 --> 03:28:26,780
R1?

4511
03:28:27,320 --> 03:28:27,740
Oh!

4512
03:28:31,900 --> 03:28:32,200
Snake!

4513
03:28:32,260 --> 03:28:34,140
Snake, you're not even trying to hide it.

4514
03:28:34,240 --> 03:28:35,280
The name's Eva.

4515
03:28:36,340 --> 03:28:36,860
Hmm.

4516
03:28:48,820 --> 03:28:50,120
The name's Eva.

4517
03:28:51,740 --> 03:28:54,720
Oh wait, actually this is one of my favorite snake moments.

4518
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:57,780
One of my favorite naked snake moments.

4519
03:28:57,960 --> 03:28:59,100
This wasn't part of the plan.

4520
03:28:59,380 --> 03:29:00,200
What happened to Adam?

4521
03:29:01,060 --> 03:29:02,320
He's just such a dork.

4522
03:29:02,340 --> 03:29:03,040
I love this man.

4523
03:29:04,540 --> 03:29:05,400
It's Snake.

4524
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:07,600
Snake, huh?

4525
03:29:07,900 --> 03:29:08,040
Yeah.

4526
03:29:09,620 --> 03:29:10,760
Well, I'm Eva.

4527
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:13,020
Are you here to tempt me?

4528
03:29:17,600 --> 03:29:19,100
What happened to Adam?

4529
03:29:21,640 --> 03:29:23,540
Colonel Vulcan is a very suspicious man.

4530
03:29:23,660 --> 03:29:26,040
He decided Adam wasn't the right person for this mission.

4531
03:29:26,780 --> 03:29:27,860
And you were?

4532
03:29:29,280 --> 03:29:29,840
Yes.

4533
03:29:30,160 --> 03:29:30,480
Why?

4534
03:29:31,820 --> 03:29:34,040
Because I can do things he can't.

4535
03:29:34,080 --> 03:29:34,480
Ooh!

4536
03:29:34,480 --> 03:29:39,980
I heard you used to be a code breaker for the NSA.

4537
03:29:40,860 --> 03:29:41,640
I was.

4538
03:29:41,880 --> 03:29:44,380
Four years ago I defected to the Soviet Union with Adam.

4539
03:29:44,380 --> 03:29:45,340
God, she's so hot.

4540
03:29:46,700 --> 03:29:47,440
Mouser military.

4541
03:29:49,140 --> 03:29:50,240
The broom handle.

4542
03:29:51,180 --> 03:29:52,800
It packs quite a punch.

4543
03:29:52,860 --> 03:29:54,420
Nice to have when you're on a bike.

4544
03:29:54,780 --> 03:29:55,540
This guy.

4545
03:29:55,680 --> 03:29:59,500
You held it sideways and used the muzzle jump to create a horizontal sweep.

4546
03:30:00,400 --> 03:30:01,420
That was impressive.

4547
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:04,460
Bet you've never seen that technique in the West.

4548
03:30:05,400 --> 03:30:06,880
It's imitation, isn't it?

4549
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:07,400
Yeah.

4550
03:30:08,140 --> 03:30:10,020
It's a Chinese Type 17 pistol.

4551
03:30:10,980 --> 03:30:11,740
Around here.

4552
03:30:11,880 --> 03:30:13,300
Even that's hard to come by.

4553
03:30:16,320 --> 03:30:17,180
Don't worry, though.

4554
03:30:17,560 --> 03:30:19,420
The one I've got for you is American made.

4555
03:30:19,420 --> 03:30:20,400
He's such a nerd.

4556
03:30:22,240 --> 03:30:23,080
God, okay, here.

4557
03:30:23,120 --> 03:30:24,080
Oh, I love this boy!

4558
03:30:26,460 --> 03:30:27,320
Forty-five, huh?

4559
03:30:27,940 --> 03:30:30,680
Oh my God, the way he manhandles this gun.

4560
03:30:31,420 --> 03:30:31,820
God.

4561
03:30:35,140 --> 03:30:36,180
Do you like it?

4562
03:30:37,100 --> 03:30:39,820
The feeding ramp is polished to a mirror sheen.

4563
03:30:40,280 --> 03:30:41,600
The slide's been reinforced.

4564
03:30:42,540 --> 03:30:45,260
And the interlock with the frame is tightened for added precision.

4565
03:30:46,140 --> 03:30:48,200
The sight system is original, too.

4566
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:51,160
The thumb safety is extended to make it easier on the finger.

4567
03:30:51,340 --> 03:30:53,800
A long type trigger with non-slip grooves.

4568
03:30:54,400 --> 03:30:55,480
A ring hammer.

4569
03:30:55,640 --> 03:30:58,620
The base of the trigger guard's been filed down for a higher grip.

4570
03:30:58,740 --> 03:30:58,920
Yeah, I know.

4571
03:30:59,120 --> 03:31:00,260
And not only that.

4572
03:31:00,380 --> 03:31:00,980
I wish I was that gun.

4573
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:02,340
I know.

4574
03:31:03,440 --> 03:31:04,440
Oh my God, I love this gun.

4575
03:31:04,460 --> 03:31:05,660
Look at the way he's caressing it.

4576
03:31:06,080 --> 03:31:07,800
This fucking nerd!

4577
03:31:08,640 --> 03:31:08,700
Ah!

4578
03:31:13,590 --> 03:31:15,290
Where'd you get something like this?

4579
03:31:15,890 --> 03:31:18,370
I grabbed it from a western munitions armory.

4580
03:31:18,690 --> 03:31:20,950
It probably used to belong to one of your officers.

4581
03:31:21,270 --> 03:31:22,730
And there were more where that came from.

4582
03:31:23,530 --> 03:31:23,910
Oh!

4583
03:31:25,570 --> 03:31:26,930
Oh my gosh, uniform!

4584
03:31:29,010 --> 03:31:30,830
You had this with you, didn't you?

4585
03:31:30,910 --> 03:31:31,490
He's such a nerd!

4586
03:31:34,130 --> 03:31:35,350
Oh my God!

4587
03:31:35,350 --> 03:31:36,530
Better take this too.

4588
03:31:36,690 --> 03:31:37,670
Oh my God!

4589
03:31:37,870 --> 03:31:38,190
What's that?

4590
03:31:39,030 --> 03:31:41,150
A disguise to make you look like a scientist.

4591
03:31:41,510 --> 03:31:42,510
A disguise?

4592
03:31:43,290 --> 03:31:43,810
Yes.

4593
03:31:44,450 --> 03:31:46,230
You're here to rescue Sokolov, right?

4594
03:31:46,430 --> 03:31:46,790
That's right.

4595
03:31:46,830 --> 03:31:47,810
Sokolov's still safe then.

4596
03:31:48,310 --> 03:31:48,790
Yes.

4597
03:31:48,890 --> 03:31:51,350
He's being forced to continue his work on the Shagohan.

4598
03:31:51,570 --> 03:31:52,090
Where?

4599
03:31:52,950 --> 03:31:53,930
At the lab.

4600
03:31:54,190 --> 03:31:57,350
They've got a whole army of scientists there developing new weapons.

4601
03:31:57,650 --> 03:32:02,850
Security is tight, but if you disguise yourself as a scientist, you might be able to sneak in.

4602
03:32:05,350 --> 03:32:06,290
They'll believe me?

4603
03:32:06,450 --> 03:32:07,970
Can we get Sokolov out of there?

4604
03:32:07,970 --> 03:32:09,490
They'll believe that this man is a scientist.

4605
03:32:09,630 --> 03:32:09,910
We'll see, won't we?

4606
03:32:11,050 --> 03:32:12,450
Tell me how to get to the lab.

4607
03:32:13,630 --> 03:32:15,370
The safest way in is from the rear.

4608
03:32:16,790 --> 03:32:19,010
We're getting our first snakebomb.

4609
03:32:19,010 --> 03:32:19,330
We're getting our first snakebomb.

4610
03:32:19,330 --> 03:32:21,010
First, you'll need to head north through the jungle.

4611
03:32:21,030 --> 03:32:22,370
When I got him, I grabbed him and put the paint job.

4612
03:32:22,370 --> 03:32:23,990
You'll come to a heliport used for shipping materials.

4613
03:32:24,810 --> 03:32:28,390
Pass the heliport and continue north and there will be a large crevice.

4614
03:32:28,530 --> 03:32:28,610
Pass the heliport and continue north and there will be a large crevice.

4615
03:32:28,730 --> 03:32:30,830
Descend into that area and you'll reach a cave.

4616
03:32:31,130 --> 03:32:32,830
Move through the cave and you will arrive at the cave.

4617
03:32:32,850 --> 03:32:34,010
You'll arrive at a mangrove swamp.

4618
03:32:35,110 --> 03:32:37,530
After the swamp, there'll be a warehouse.

4619
03:32:38,050 --> 03:32:43,010
Make your way through the warehouse and you'll come out just south of the lab.

4620
03:32:45,550 --> 03:32:47,010
Are you even listening?

4621
03:32:47,150 --> 03:32:48,230
Just what are you doing there?

4622
03:32:49,430 --> 03:32:53,970
In close range combat, a knife can sometimes be more useful than a gun.

4623
03:32:54,270 --> 03:32:58,670
By doing this, I'll be able to hold a knife at the same time and still keep the gun steady.

4624
03:32:59,590 --> 03:33:03,350
That way, I can instantly switch between a gun battle and a knife fight.

4625
03:33:03,790 --> 03:33:04,610
Knife fight!

4626
03:33:10,020 --> 03:33:10,680
Knife gun.

4627
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:12,280
Right, let's get going.

4628
03:33:12,580 --> 03:33:13,220
Wait a minute.

4629
03:33:13,260 --> 03:33:15,740
You must be tired.

4630
03:33:16,200 --> 03:33:17,680
Why don't you take a little rest?

4631
03:33:18,160 --> 03:33:19,220
I'll be fine.

4632
03:33:20,220 --> 03:33:23,060
Oh, I'm not fine.

4633
03:33:23,660 --> 03:33:25,340
You'll never make it in your condition.

4634
03:33:26,140 --> 03:33:28,160
It's a jungle out there.

4635
03:33:30,300 --> 03:33:31,940
There's still an hour before dawn.

4636
03:33:32,280 --> 03:33:33,340
I think it's a...

4637
03:33:33,340 --> 03:33:35,820
It's dangerous to be out in the jungle at night without a guide.

4638
03:33:36,160 --> 03:33:37,460
What about you?

4639
03:33:37,680 --> 03:33:39,100
I have to get back.

4640
03:33:39,460 --> 03:33:40,980
I can't be gone for too long.

4641
03:33:41,160 --> 03:33:42,780
They'll start to suspect something.

4642
03:33:45,780 --> 03:33:47,360
It's a jungle out there.

4643
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:48,600
Don't worry.

4644
03:33:48,780 --> 03:33:50,560
I'll keep you updated over the radio.

4645
03:33:52,120 --> 03:33:52,780
That's it?

4646
03:33:54,080 --> 03:33:56,340
My orders are to provide you with information.

4647
03:33:57,080 --> 03:33:57,640
Nothing more.

4648
03:33:58,240 --> 03:33:59,560
She's so hot.

4649
03:34:01,340 --> 03:34:02,480
Oh my god.

4650
03:34:02,540 --> 03:34:02,900
You look disappointed.

4651
03:34:04,120 --> 03:34:06,960
She is like the hottest Metal Gear character.

4652
03:34:07,180 --> 03:34:08,540
I stand by it.

4653
03:34:14,100 --> 03:34:15,440
Too close, ma'am.

4654
03:34:15,640 --> 03:34:17,080
I'll stand watch until dawn.

4655
03:34:17,160 --> 03:34:18,580
Now be a good boy and lie down.

4656
03:34:18,840 --> 03:34:19,700
Okay, yes ma'am.

4657
03:34:21,400 --> 03:34:24,760
Okay, lay down.

4658
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:25,880
What's the matter?

4659
03:34:27,920 --> 03:34:30,140
I don't know you well enough to trust you.

4660
03:34:30,500 --> 03:34:34,260
How well do you have to know me to trust me?

4661
03:34:34,460 --> 03:34:38,140
I don't know if I can trust anybody.

4662
03:34:40,520 --> 03:34:42,900
This poor traumatized guy.

4663
03:34:43,060 --> 03:34:43,760
So sad.

4664
03:34:47,520 --> 03:34:48,680
Answer the phone, honey.

4665
03:34:53,180 --> 03:34:55,240
He doesn't know what to believe.

4666
03:34:55,800 --> 03:34:57,860
I should have kept the naked on.

4667
03:34:59,560 --> 03:34:59,800
You're right, Snake.

4668
03:35:00,060 --> 03:35:01,080
You should get some sleep.

4669
03:35:01,540 --> 03:35:04,460
Although, in your condition, you really ought to be back in the ICU.

4670
03:35:04,920 --> 03:35:06,520
Well, maybe you should have better soldiers then.

4671
03:35:06,560 --> 03:35:08,380
Whenever you save the game and quit, you'll go to sleep.

4672
03:35:08,720 --> 03:35:10,980
Sleeping allows you to gain back stamina naturally.

4673
03:35:11,540 --> 03:35:15,760
Depending on how long you sleep, you may also recover naturally from sickness and injury.

4674
03:35:16,660 --> 03:35:20,020
When you're tired or hurt, the best thing to do is just get some sleep.

4675
03:35:20,400 --> 03:35:22,320
So do yourself a favor and take a nap.

4676
03:35:22,700 --> 03:35:23,940
Doctor's orders, okay?

4677
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:25,020
Yeah.

4678
03:35:25,700 --> 03:35:25,980
Okay.

4679
03:35:27,360 --> 03:35:30,620
Are you telling me to stop playing the game, paramedics?

4680
03:35:32,860 --> 03:35:34,800
Sleeping makes me feel good.

4681
03:35:35,820 --> 03:35:36,720
Oh, save?

4682
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:36,980
Yeah.

4683
03:35:45,010 --> 03:35:46,510
Sorry for all the crunch.

4684
03:35:49,030 --> 03:35:49,990
I'm so sorry.

4685
03:35:51,830 --> 03:35:53,430
The cheese is so hard.

4686
03:35:53,710 --> 03:35:55,010
It's like a little cheese snack.

4687
03:35:58,190 --> 03:35:59,670
How long are you planning to go?

4688
03:36:00,630 --> 03:36:03,390
Actually, I'm gonna finish up like right now.

4689
03:36:06,310 --> 03:36:06,750
Game?

4690
03:36:43,970 --> 03:36:45,610
You meant that literally, huh?

4691
03:36:48,370 --> 03:36:48,810
Game?

4692
03:37:13,280 --> 03:37:14,320
I'm scared.

4693
03:37:16,800 --> 03:37:17,620
No way.

4694
03:37:18,300 --> 03:37:19,640
The game, oh my gosh.

4695
03:37:19,760 --> 03:37:21,200
My PS2 took it literally.

4696
03:37:21,240 --> 03:37:23,140
It was just like, go to sleep.

4697
03:37:24,900 --> 03:37:25,340
Um...

4698
03:37:27,080 --> 03:37:27,520
Wow.

4699
03:37:28,100 --> 03:37:28,540
Uh...

4700
03:37:29,580 --> 03:37:31,780
Well, I think I will probably have to...

4701
03:37:32,540 --> 03:37:32,980
It's

4702
03:37:37,130 --> 03:37:38,190
only like two hours.

4703
03:37:43,110 --> 03:37:43,910
No way.

4704
03:37:44,610 --> 03:37:45,790
Hope it doesn't corrupt it.

4705
03:37:45,870 --> 03:37:46,250
Yeah, me too.

4706
03:37:47,470 --> 03:37:49,190
I think I will actually...

4707
03:37:51,390 --> 03:37:52,210
No way.

4708
03:37:52,350 --> 03:37:52,730
Oh wait.

4709
03:37:52,770 --> 03:37:54,850
I'm so scared for future play stuff now.

4710
03:37:55,310 --> 03:37:56,170
No way.

4711
03:37:56,250 --> 03:38:00,430
Yeah, I can just get the cutscenes and get back to this probably like pretty easily, not gonna lie.

4712
03:38:00,630 --> 03:38:01,310
But I'm...

4713
03:38:01,930 --> 03:38:02,530
Um...

4714
03:38:06,190 --> 03:38:12,030
Hopefully this is not something that happens in the future.

4715
03:38:14,030 --> 03:38:14,630
PS2...

4716
03:38:15,330 --> 03:38:16,290
PS2 hardware.

4717
03:38:16,890 --> 03:38:17,490
Ganbare!

4718
03:38:18,130 --> 03:38:18,730
Ganbare!

4719
03:38:21,350 --> 03:38:23,130
Gotta rotate those saves, boss.

4720
03:38:23,350 --> 03:38:23,570
Yeah!

4721
03:38:24,690 --> 03:38:26,370
Yes, this is a big learning.

4722
03:38:26,530 --> 03:38:27,070
Yeah!

4723
03:38:30,530 --> 03:38:30,970
Okay.

4724
03:38:32,830 --> 03:38:34,590
This is good to know.

4725
03:38:34,690 --> 03:38:35,650
This is very good to know.

4726
03:38:36,210 --> 03:38:37,430
Because we're so early.

4727
03:38:37,710 --> 03:38:38,790
Because we're so early.

4728
03:38:38,850 --> 03:38:39,830
This is very good to know.

4729
03:38:42,030 --> 03:38:42,590
Don't worry!

4730
03:38:43,090 --> 03:38:46,710
Next week, we will just start at this point.

4731
03:38:46,970 --> 03:38:47,830
So, um...

4732
03:38:49,490 --> 03:38:50,950
Don't think that, uh...

4733
03:38:50,950 --> 03:38:53,830
That this is gonna like hinder anything.

4734
03:38:55,190 --> 03:38:55,630
Um...

4735
03:38:58,050 --> 03:38:58,610
We'll...

4736
03:38:58,610 --> 03:39:01,070
We'll get it all set up and everything.

4737
03:39:01,310 --> 03:39:02,810
I know that we didn't get very far.

4738
03:39:03,530 --> 03:39:04,090
Um...

4739
03:39:04,090 --> 03:39:08,530
This game, I always underestimate how much a cutscene.

4740
03:39:08,810 --> 03:39:11,910
And also, you know, I'm pretty slow with these types of games.

4741
03:39:12,390 --> 03:39:13,810
Because I like to...

4742
03:39:13,810 --> 03:39:22,970
I imagine that the demo at TGS will be probably up to the end of Virtuous Mission?

4743
03:39:23,430 --> 03:39:24,670
Is my imagination.

4744
03:39:26,090 --> 03:39:26,650
So...

4745
03:39:27,070 --> 03:39:27,590
Oh my gosh.

4746
03:39:27,650 --> 03:39:28,670
I'm gonna be able to see Aslan.

4747
03:39:28,930 --> 03:39:30,730
I might be able to see Aslan.

4748
03:39:32,030 --> 03:39:32,670
Oh gosh.

4749
03:39:32,890 --> 03:39:33,210
Oh gosh.

4750
03:39:33,330 --> 03:39:33,670
Oh gosh.

4751
03:39:33,670 --> 03:39:33,970
Oh gosh.

4752
03:39:34,790 --> 03:39:36,250
Oh gosh.

4753
03:39:36,930 --> 03:39:37,210
Oh gosh.

4754
03:39:37,270 --> 03:39:37,430
Oh gosh.

4755
03:39:37,590 --> 03:39:37,650
Oh gosh.

4756
03:39:37,650 --> 03:39:37,730
Oh gosh.

4757
03:39:37,870 --> 03:39:37,870
Oh gosh.

4758
03:39:37,890 --> 03:39:38,790
Oh gosh.

4759
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:41,570
Hopefully.

4760
03:39:42,370 --> 03:39:44,210
It might just be all gameplay.

4761
03:39:44,390 --> 03:39:45,250
There might be no cutscenes.

4762
03:39:45,350 --> 03:39:45,730
We'll see.

4763
03:39:46,070 --> 03:39:46,630
We'll see.

4764
03:39:46,670 --> 03:39:46,950
We'll see.

4765
03:39:46,950 --> 03:39:47,250
We'll see.

4766
03:39:47,410 --> 03:39:48,030
We'll see.

4767
03:39:48,230 --> 03:39:51,630
But yeah, I will be going to TGS to go um... attempt.

4768
03:39:52,110 --> 03:39:55,910
I say attempt to play Delta because I'm not sure how... like...

4769
03:39:57,290 --> 03:39:57,730
um...

4770
03:39:59,070 --> 03:40:00,650
the lines are kind of crazy.

4771
03:40:01,230 --> 03:40:03,190
And um... they give out like tickets.

4772
03:40:03,250 --> 03:40:04,370
This happened to me last year.

4773
03:40:04,550 --> 03:40:07,990
I couldn't play the Master Collection because um...

4774
03:40:08,530 --> 03:40:13,590
because they gave out all the tickets within like 10 minutes of TGS start opening up.

4775
03:40:13,690 --> 03:40:14,470
So it was kind of crazy.

4776
03:40:14,670 --> 03:40:19,270
You get a ticket for like a time slot and you have to come back during that time slot in the day.

4777
03:40:19,730 --> 03:40:20,870
So um...

4778
03:40:20,870 --> 03:40:28,150
If you are also ever, you know going to an event like that it's pretty common practice for stuff like that.

4779
03:40:28,210 --> 03:40:32,290
So if you want to play something get there early, early, early, early.

4780
03:40:33,270 --> 03:40:35,610
It's not like you just stand in a line and wait.

4781
03:40:35,730 --> 03:40:36,290
No, no, no.

4782
03:40:36,470 --> 03:40:39,070
If they give out all the tickets then it's done.

4783
03:40:39,210 --> 03:40:39,650
That's it.

4784
03:40:40,610 --> 03:40:42,870
Yeah, so I will be attempting.

4785
03:40:43,190 --> 03:40:48,110
I will be attempting and I will give you all the full report once I'm home.

4786
03:40:48,410 --> 03:40:51,150
And I can tell you guys all about Delta the demo.

4787
03:40:51,270 --> 03:40:51,550
Hopefully!

4788
03:40:51,770 --> 03:40:53,450
I'm really... I'm...

4789
03:40:55,190 --> 03:40:56,150
I'm hoping.

4790
03:40:56,430 --> 03:40:57,790
My fingers are crossed.

4791
03:40:57,930 --> 03:40:58,490
I'm praying.

4792
03:40:59,650 --> 03:41:01,310
I plan on getting there super early.

4793
03:41:01,530 --> 03:41:04,050
Hope there's no issues with your memory card.

4794
03:41:04,210 --> 03:41:06,830
Just curious if you're going to stream Snake vs.

4795
03:41:07,010 --> 03:41:07,270
Monkey.

4796
03:41:07,390 --> 03:41:08,830
I'd love to stream Snake vs.

4797
03:41:09,090 --> 03:41:09,350
Monkey!

4798
03:41:09,650 --> 03:41:10,690
I would, I would.

4799
03:41:12,550 --> 03:41:13,150
But yeah.

4800
03:41:13,370 --> 03:41:14,090
Well, okay.

4801
03:41:14,230 --> 03:41:16,390
I guess this is a good stopping point then, huh?

4802
03:41:16,550 --> 03:41:19,090
Because I'm being forced to stop.

4803
03:41:21,910 --> 03:41:23,790
But thank you guys for today!

4804
03:41:24,190 --> 03:41:28,210
Thank you for starting Metal Gear Solid 3 with me!

4805
03:41:29,070 --> 03:41:33,390
The next times I play, I plan on going long and hard.

4806
03:41:33,670 --> 03:41:37,570
So get ready for some perhaps endurance streams.

4807
03:41:38,510 --> 03:41:44,010
I guess this also gives me a chance to practice a little more, I guess.

4808
03:41:45,130 --> 03:41:50,730
If it is corrupted to get back to where I need to get to be at.

4809
03:41:50,730 --> 03:41:51,510
So...

4810
03:41:52,750 --> 03:41:53,950
I'm so scared!

4811
03:41:58,990 --> 03:41:59,830
I don't know.

4812
03:42:00,990 --> 03:42:01,590
But yeah.

4813
03:42:01,810 --> 03:42:03,170
What an awkward ending.

4814
03:42:05,430 --> 03:42:07,190
Do you want to find out on stream?

4815
03:42:07,310 --> 03:42:08,250
No, I'm too scared.

4816
03:42:08,730 --> 03:42:09,530
It's okay though.

4817
03:42:09,570 --> 03:42:10,030
It's all good.

4818
03:42:10,210 --> 03:42:11,550
Like I said, I can just...

4819
03:42:13,370 --> 03:42:18,450
I'd rather this be a stopping point and then we can pick up next week.

4820
03:42:18,690 --> 03:42:19,430
Next Saturday.

4821
03:42:19,810 --> 03:42:20,410
Yes, yes.

4822
03:42:20,950 --> 03:42:21,990
It's old hardware.

4823
03:42:22,090 --> 03:42:22,630
It happens.

4824
03:42:22,830 --> 03:42:23,270
Exactly.

4825
03:42:24,350 --> 03:42:24,870
So...

4826
03:42:25,590 --> 03:42:26,110
Anyway!

4827
03:42:27,250 --> 03:42:29,890
Thank you guys for hanging out with me today.

4828
03:42:29,950 --> 03:42:31,330
Thank you for letting me...

4829
03:42:31,330 --> 03:42:34,790
Thank you for indulging me in my pleasures and my brain rot.

4830
03:42:37,270 --> 03:42:38,310
Holy moly.

4831
03:42:39,290 --> 03:42:39,810
I...

4832
03:42:41,350 --> 03:42:41,870
I'm...

4833
03:42:41,870 --> 03:42:42,610
I...

4834
03:42:43,550 --> 03:42:45,170
I love this game so much.

4835
03:42:45,430 --> 03:42:46,450
Thank you guys!

4836
03:42:46,970 --> 03:42:49,810
And have a...

4837
03:42:49,810 --> 03:42:51,710
Surprising to do master collection.

4838
03:42:51,990 --> 03:42:53,450
Well, there's a reason for that.

4839
03:42:54,390 --> 03:42:55,850
It's because subsistence...

4840
03:42:55,850 --> 03:42:57,290
Master collection takes out some stuff.

4841
03:42:57,550 --> 03:42:59,130
I've already played the master collection.

4842
03:42:59,490 --> 03:43:01,450
I wanted to try one of the different games.

4843
03:43:01,630 --> 03:43:01,930
So...

4844
03:43:02,450 --> 03:43:10,410
And I didn't want to do the original because I wanted the option between the original camera angles and the new camera angles.

4845
03:43:10,470 --> 03:43:11,950
So that's why I did subsistence.

4846
03:43:12,130 --> 03:43:14,790
But also I wanted the dream sequence and stuff like that.

4847
03:43:15,030 --> 03:43:17,990
And snake versus monkey.

4848
03:43:19,950 --> 03:43:21,150
But yeah, so...

4849
03:43:21,150 --> 03:43:22,570
That's basically why.

4850
03:43:22,710 --> 03:43:23,250
Yeah, yeah.

4851
03:43:24,310 --> 03:43:24,750
I have a reasons.

4852
03:43:25,190 --> 03:43:26,190
My reasons reasons.

4853
03:43:27,970 --> 03:43:28,590
Okie dokie!

4854
03:43:31,610 --> 03:43:32,010
Otsumita!

4855
03:43:32,370 --> 03:43:33,090
Thank you guys!

4856
03:43:33,450 --> 03:43:34,270
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4857
03:43:34,330 --> 03:43:34,890
Have a good day!

4858
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:35,450
Have a good night!

4859
03:43:35,510 --> 03:43:36,150
Have a good weekend!

4860
03:43:37,530 --> 03:43:38,110
Bye bye!

4861
03:43:38,530 --> 03:43:39,070
Bye bye!

4862
03:43:39,130 --> 03:43:39,510
Thank you!

4863
03:43:39,530 --> 03:43:41,210
I'm sorry that this kind of ended weird.

4864
03:43:41,430 --> 03:43:42,570
But thank you!

4865
03:43:42,750 --> 03:43:43,610
Thank you, thank you!

4866
03:43:44,210 --> 03:43:45,450
Tip for favorite ghost.

4867
03:43:45,590 --> 03:43:46,070
Thank you!

4868
03:43:47,170 --> 03:43:48,110
Thank you so much!

4869
03:43:48,150 --> 03:43:48,590
Bye bye!

4870
03:43:49,030 --> 03:43:49,950
Bye bye, bye bye!
