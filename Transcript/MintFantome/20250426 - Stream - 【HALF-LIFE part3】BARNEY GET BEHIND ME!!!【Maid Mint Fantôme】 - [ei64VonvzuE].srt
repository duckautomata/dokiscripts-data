1
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,490
Wait, where's my game?

2
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,810
Oh, there it is.

3
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:46,110
Welcome to Half-Life 1, part 3.

4
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,050
I feel like if you say Half-Life and 3...

5
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,690
In the same... In the same sentence, people will become a little wacko.

6
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,350
You bought the entire set?

7
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,150
Thank you!

8
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,630
Thank you!

9
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,950
Can't wait to use your shaker cup at the gym.

10
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,090
Thank you!

11
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,150
Oh, yeah.

12
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:17,230
I had a... My... I had a drop... GamerSupps merch drop today!

13
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,610
So... Buy it as a birthday treat!

14
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,330
Oh my gosh!

15
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,310
Happy birthday!

16
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,570
Yay!

17
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,350
Code Boomer, yeah.

18
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:29,870
So...

19
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,310
I posted about it on Twitter and on...

20
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,130
What's it called?

21
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,210
The YouTube community.

22
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,370
Sorry, my brain is so...

23
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,150
I have a question.

24
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,890
Does Half-Life 2 end on a... A cutscene?

25
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,310
No, not a cutscene.

26
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,690
Oh my gosh!

27
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,330
Sorry!

28
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,010
Sorry!

29
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,150
I'm really... Okay!

30
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:00,770
No!

31
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,730
A cliffhanger!

32
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,380
It does?

33
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,280
No way!

34
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,200
So that's why... I can't believe it's a cutscene.

35
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,040
I can't believe it's a cutscene.

36
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,420
No way!

37
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,900
So that's why people...

38
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,880
Want a third one.

39
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,360
Oh no!

40
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Am I gonna be upset?

41
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,200
Play it... I don't have my... I don't have a Half-Life 3.

42
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,220
I also did not realize Butt Pickle is on the cup.

43
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,200
Yeah, it is!

44
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,940
Code Yowie!

45
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,800
Whose code is that?

46
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,980
Mr. B, happy birthday tomorrow by the way!

47
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Happy birthday!

48
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,580
You're up soon!

49
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,900
You got the whole minky set... Thank you!

50
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,760
Thank you!

51
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,320
Thank you!

52
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,500
It's berries... Oh...

53
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,700
As... As...

54
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,220
As funny...

55
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,420
We can make haha jokes, but let's not...

56
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,080
You know...

57
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,660
Let's not... You know...

58
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,400
I have my own code too, so...

59
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,400
I can joke about it because like...

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,060
If it's me and Doki, we're...

61
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,380
We're joking ourselves...

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,600
Together...

63
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
But you know...

64
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,980
Let's...

65
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,580
Yeah... Code Boomer!

66
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,400
Code Boomer!

67
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,260
But lots of people have code, so...

68
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,480
You know...

69
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,360
I guess you can use whatever one you want...

70
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,620
But don't tell me if you use somebody else's code!

71
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,260
Only tell me if you used my code!

72
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,080
Okay?

73
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,680
Okay!

74
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,840
Half-Life 2...

75
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,460
Episode 2 does...

76
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,000
But Episode 1 and 2 are essentially...

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,680
Continuations of the main Half-Life 2 campaign...

78
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,520
Wait...

79
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,180
What do you mean...

80
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,680
Episode 1...

81
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,220
Episode 2?

82
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,120
Also Zalkin...

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,640
Thank you!

84
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,180
You're gonna...

85
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,620
Will Half-Life 3 into the world?

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,160
I know!

87
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,120
I'm really hoping!

88
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,660
I'm really hoping!

89
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,280
Because you know what also happened...

90
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,900
Is I got really...

91
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,040
Really into Metal Gear...

92
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
And everyone was always saying...

93
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,940
That...

94
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,520
A Metal Gear Solid 3 remake...

95
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,180
Was gonna happen...

96
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,500
Everybody was...

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,180
Like for years...

98
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,360
And years...

99
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,880
And years...

100
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,220
People were hinting at it...

101
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,040
And then I...

102
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,280
Played it...

103
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,260
And I...

104
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,480
Got really into it...

105
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,180
And then they announced...

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,560
Delta!

107
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,980
So...

108
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,380
I'm just saying...

109
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,560
Yeah...

110
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,420
For like 10 years...

111
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,240
They were saying that there was going to be a Metal Gear remake...

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,100
Metal Gear Solid 3 remake...

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,200
So...

114
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,260
I don't know!

115
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,140
I might...

116
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,740
Have the gift of...

117
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,460
Prophecy!

118
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,140
It's not like I used your code...

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,100
On my full set of Minto Gamer Sub merch or anything...

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,020
Thank you!

121
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm sorry Minto I only want...

122
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,240
It's okay!

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,520
No no no no no no...

124
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,080
I'm not...

125
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,980
Don't worry I'm not mad...

126
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,340
Don't worry...

127
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't worry...

128
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,660
I'm sorry...

129
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,740
Sorry if it came off as like...

130
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,340
Minky...

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,920
Minky...

132
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,640
Minky...

133
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,420
Minky...

134
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,920
Minky...

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Minky...

136
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,600
Minky...

137
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,100
Minky...

138
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,840
Minky...

139
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,400
Minky...

140
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,920
Minky...

141
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,660
Minky...

142
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,480
I think it's just uh...

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,100
JB...

144
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,120
I think it's just like uh...

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,260
How do I say?

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,280
Something to remind everybody in general...

147
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,560
You know?

148
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,540
Also for like...

149
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,800
Even in not my chat...

150
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,880
And other people's as well...

151
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,040
You know?

152
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,880
Like...

153
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,820
Oh my gosh...

154
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,680
Please!

155
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,080
Minto is forever...

156
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,380
Thank you!

157
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,600
I don't need a second installment of healthcare plan!

158
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,500
What do you mean a weekly thing you literally donated yesterday?

159
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,860
Thank you so much though...

160
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,300
Thank you Kanye East!

161
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,900
Thank you and also Anonymous...

162
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,280
Will I be playing the two DLCs for this game?

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,640
Um...

164
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,820
No pressure with the dono...

165
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,140
Just really enjoy the minky song!

166
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,920
Um...

167
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,460
Uh...

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,680
Um...

169
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,540
Maybe...

170
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,080
Uh...

171
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,540
I don't know what the DLCs are...

172
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,920
So...

173
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,020
I wouldn't say...

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,620
I wouldn't say no...

175
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:07,960
May...

176
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,400
Maybe...

177
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,680
Uh...

178
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,080
Maybe if like...

179
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,380
Well the DLCs are not canon...

180
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Oh really?

181
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,060
Oh they're much shorter!

182
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,320
Do you think I could do...

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,220
If there's two of them...

184
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,780
Could I do both in one stream?

185
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,620
Hmm...

186
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,960
Blue Shift lets you play as Barney!

187
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,220
They're...

188
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,300
Okay...

189
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,620
Maybe they're not that short...

190
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,720
Okay...

191
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,820
Understandable...

192
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,280
They're...

193
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,540
Uh...

194
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,200
Let's play as Barney...

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,780
Wow...

196
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,700
I think Blue Shift you can beat in one stream...

197
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,340
Oh okay...

198
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,560
Okay...

199
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,660
Good to know...

200
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,380
Did you see the tweet by G-Man's voice actor?

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:50,720
No!

202
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,620
Actually I don't get anything...

203
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,720
Uh...

204
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Half-Life in my timeline at all...

205
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,100
Maybe...

206
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,560
I don't know why...

207
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
I guess I haven't tweeted enough about it...

208
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,900
But...

209
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,660
I don't see anything...

210
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,640
About it...

211
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,780
Ever...

212
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,040
Will I play Black Mesa?

213
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm also...

214
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Not sure about that one yet...

215
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,660
Just because...

216
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,380
Um...

217
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,180
Uh...

218
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,800
It is a...

219
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,200
Remake...

220
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,720
Of this game...

221
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,620
We'll see...

222
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,200
Might be cool to see how...

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Wait...

224
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,000
No...

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,520
Sorry...

226
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:25,740
Yeah...

227
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,300
A remake...

228
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,580
Sorry...

229
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,880
I was thinking of...

230
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,640
What was it...

231
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,660
Half-Life Alyx...

232
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,080
I can't tell gamers up shirt to work...

233
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,860
I work at home...

234
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,800
See...

235
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,540
It is safe for work...

236
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,780
It's pretty different...

237
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,640
Oh...

238
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,460
Yeah...

239
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,940
Maybe once I'm done with the series...

240
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,180
True...

241
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,940
True...

242
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,260
Mm-mm...

243
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,820
Yeah...

244
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,220
Worth playing later...

245
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,140
It would be cool to also...

246
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,280
Go through the series...

247
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,960
And then...

248
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
Come back to...

249
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,920
What is supposed to be the beginning game...

250
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,040
Right?

251
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,060
The Black Mesa...

252
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,240
So...

253
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,660
It's...

254
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,340
Kind of like...

255
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,640
Not a...

256
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,220
It's almost like a refresher...

257
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,180
But then it's also new at the same time...

258
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,040
Mm-mm...

259
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,980
Mm-mm...

260
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Yeah...

261
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,940
Yeah...

262
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,800
You know...

263
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,400
Sometimes...

264
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,780
I wanna play a game series...

265
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,120
But the vibes...

266
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,660
Aren't...

267
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,140
Maybe I'm waiting for something...

268
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,560
Uh...

269
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,220
Or the vibes aren't right...

270
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,760
Or whatever...

271
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,080
Whatever...

272
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,980
You know...

273
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,840
Thank you...

274
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,980
That'll do...

275
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,640
Big hypers...

276
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,880
Yeah...

277
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,080
I totally didn't buy your Gamersubs cup...

278
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,560
For the color changing panto...

279
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:43,960
I swear...

280
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,640
It's kind of genius though...

281
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,000
No...

282
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,040
Right...

283
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,360
When I thought of that...

284
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,080
When I thought of that...

285
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,040
I was like...

286
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,760
Whoa...

287
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,080
I think my brain is cooking...

288
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,180
I bought it for the box...

289
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,640
The idea of coming back to the start...

290
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,500
Is why I want Metal Gear 1 2 remakes in 3D someday...

291
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,020
I can see that...

292
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,180
I just hope that with Metal Gear 1...

293
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,880
I wish...

294
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,300
I would want them to put them both into one game probably...

295
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,580
Because with Metal Gear 1...

296
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,180
I would be too afraid of them...

297
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,080
Adding erroneous stuff...

298
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,960
And characters that don't matter...

299
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,040
Because Metal Gear 1 was already so...

300
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,920
Like you know...

301
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,420
Bare bones in terms of story...

302
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,680
But...

303
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,520
2...

304
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,120
Metal Gear 2 has a lot of story...

305
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,040
Looking at the Final Fantasy 7 Remake...

306
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,580
What's that?

307
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,380
I...

308
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,260
Loved the first part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake...

309
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,980
Final Fantasy 7 2 Remake...

310
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,680
I fear the ending of it is...

311
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,640
But there's a...

312
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,860
There's gonna be a third part...

313
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,740
But I fear the ending of the...

314
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,420
Second part...

315
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,640
Does not...

316
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,560
Does not...

317
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,900
Make me confident...

318
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,600
I don't know...

319
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,100
I don't know...

320
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,520
I really...

321
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,660
I loved the whole game...

322
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,420
Up until the end...

323
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,060
I really...

324
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,260
I really...

325
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,580
Loved the whole game...

326
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,500
Up until the end...

327
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,440
But yeah...

328
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,460
I don't wanna spoil anything...

329
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,120
How are you doing out of 10 today?

330
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,160
How are you doing out of 10 today?

331
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,560
Thanks Jay!

332
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Thank you for asking...

333
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,420
I am...

334
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,520
I am...

335
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,420
I am...

336
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,520
6 out of 10...

337
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,080
I have...

338
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,420
I have a little bit of light sensitivity today...

339
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:35,920
Hmm...

340
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,460
There's always something wrong...

341
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,080
It's hard to explain...

342
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,940
They're not really DLC...

343
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,420
More like...

344
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,080
Separate expansions of the main story...

345
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,360
Bits and pieces are canon...

346
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,140
But not the full thing...

347
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,820
Much shorter...

348
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,940
Especially Blue Shift...

349
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,180
Also Half-Life Decay...

350
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,100
Exists...

351
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,060
Is that the other one...

352
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,320
Called?

353
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,780
Also...

354
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,640
Thank you so much...

355
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,960
Thank you so much Felix...

356
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,340
For the pink!

357
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:53,980
Thank you!

358
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,420
Thank you!

359
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,980
Thank you!

360
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:57,900
Hmm...

361
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:58,820
Hmm...

362
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,720
6 is decent...

363
00:13:59,720 --> 00:13:59,860
Yeah!

364
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm feeling...

365
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm feeling pretty good today...

366
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,580
All things considered...

367
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,140
Even if I called...

368
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,300
A cliffhanger...

369
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,320
A cutscene...

370
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,780
After 2 hours of waiting...

371
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,700
To be able to buy everything...

372
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,220
I was finally...

373
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,660
Oh!

374
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,360
Thank you!

375
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,640
Thank you so much!

376
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,500
Thank you!

377
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:16,780
Thank you!

378
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,020
Thank you!

379
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,480
I hope...

380
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,500
I hope you guys...

381
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,800
Um...

382
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,660
If everybody...

383
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,060
Hi!

384
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,020
I know some people were kind of like...

385
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,660
Hesitant about the design...

386
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,520
And...

387
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,720
I get it!

388
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,400
I get it!

389
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,580
Because...

390
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,200
Uh...

391
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,840
It is a...

392
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,140
The...

393
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,940
The panties showing is a little more...

394
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
And I...

395
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,700
I wouldn't even wear it myself...

396
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,600
Which is so bad!

397
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,040
Um...

398
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,860
But...

399
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,580
Even though I have...

400
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:44,840
Worn...

401
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
Shirts that...

402
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,600
Have like...

403
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Eroge on it...

404
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,100
But it's like...

405
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,960
I don't know...

406
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,740
That was a long time ago...

407
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,940
But I never wore the...

408
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,820
Ahegao t-shirt...

409
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,640
I can say...

410
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,860
100% I'm wearing it to my...

411
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,820
Upcoming work performance evaluation...

412
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,740
Just always...

413
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,420
Just don't turn your back on them...

414
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,580
You know?

415
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,740
But...

416
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,120
What I wanna say is...

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,500
Even if you don't buy it...

418
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,420
That's totally okay...

419
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,200
Not every...

420
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,860
I...

421
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,540
I will make more shirts in the future...

422
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,660
And not every...

423
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,860
Merch drop is gonna be for everybody...

424
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,720
And...

425
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,780
Um...

426
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,460
Yeah...

427
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,100
Just don't...

428
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,200
Don't worry about it...

429
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,060
If you're just like...

430
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,540
Ah...

431
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,740
I wanna support her...

432
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,200
But the shirt is not really my thing...

433
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,780
That's okay...

434
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,420
You know?

435
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,440
You're not gonna make me upset...

436
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Mmm...

437
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,940
It's all good...

438
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,260
And I think that applies to...

439
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,380
All merch...

440
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,140
In the future...

441
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,620
You know?

442
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,280
For anybody...

443
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,160
Um...

444
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,520
You know?

445
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,760
Don't force yourself...

446
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't...

447
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,300
Especially if it's like...

448
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,560
Something that...

449
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,660
Will hurt your paycheck...

450
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,880
Or anything so much...

451
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,700
Minto eroge shirt...

452
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,040
Got it...

453
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,160
You know?

454
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,820
So...

455
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,840
Don't feel like you're a bad fan...

456
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
If you don't buy...

457
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,000
Um...

458
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,460
If you don't buy...

459
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,160
Um...

460
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,300
Uh...

461
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,820
Every single merch...

462
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,320
Or anything like that...

463
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,000
So...

464
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,880
Mmm...

465
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,400
Yeah...

466
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't worry about it...

467
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,160
The design is so you though...

468
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,540
Thanks?

469
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,760
I think...

470
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,600
Uh...

471
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,560
Mmm...

472
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,840
So...

473
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,420
Yeah...

474
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:22,640
Yeah...

475
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,160
Yeah...

476
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,760
As an enjoyer of the bakery...

477
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,440
I love it...

478
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,740
Good to know...

479
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,700
Um...

480
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:32,940
The main...

481
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,320
Half-Life 1 expansion...

482
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
Is called Opposing Force...

483
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
And you play as one of the soldiers...

484
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,200
That come...

485
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,380
To clean up Black Mesa...

486
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,520
What?

487
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,740
That's kinda cool actually...

488
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,400
Jukebox...

489
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,080

Thank you, Sissy...

493
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,200
Have I been following...

494
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,840

Yes...

499
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,600
Well...

500
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,460
Okay...

501
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,880
I...

502
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,900
Someone told me about it...

503
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,480
The other day...

504
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,140
And I've been watching them...

505
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,040
But I'm not...

506
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,460
Like...

507
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm not...

508
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
I'm not...

509
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,800
Um...

510
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,220
I don't have like...

511
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
A horse Oshi...

512
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,560
Or anything yet...

513
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,960
So...

514
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,500
I'm...

515
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm not super deep in...

516
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,300
I've only just been placing...

517
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,200
I've been placing bets casually...

518
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,140
But I'm not...

519
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,240
Super...

520
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,640
Uh...

521
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,000
For those...

522
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,380
Hold on...

523
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,060
What's it called again?

524
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,040
Horse...

525
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,940
Uh...

526
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Hold on...

527
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,920
What's it called?

528
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,120
What's the last one?

529
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,560
Uh...

530
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:27,900
Test?

531
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,600
Horse...

532
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,600
Test?

533
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,540
Is it?

534
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,760
Yeah...

535
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:31,880
Yeah...

536
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah...

537
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,640
Horse...

538
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:32,980

539
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,920
Test...

540
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,840
So...

541
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
It's so funny...

542
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,420
Because it's like...

543
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,560
Kind of...

544
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,540
It's...

545
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,620
It's like...

546
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,400
It's...

547
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,220
I bet...

548
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,540
Like...

549
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,700
I bet the...

550
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,720
The...

551
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,120
Like...

552
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,940
English...

553
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,020
Tuma Musume...

554
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,260
Team...

555
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,660
Are like...

556
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,060
Punching the air right now...

557
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,200
Half...

558
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,120
Because they're just like...

559
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
It should've been us!

560
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,400
And half...

561
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,880
Because it's...

562
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,700
People are like...

563
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,060
They're getting into...

564
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,900
Horse girls!

565
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,280
They're getting into...

566
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,920
Horse girls!

567
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,620
Girls...

568
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,080
Haha...

569
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,320
Haha...

570
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,920
Just...

571
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,940
If you are so confused about what's going on...

572
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,120
I also don't really quite understand it...

573
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,980
But...

574
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,080
But...

575
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,240
Just go to...

576
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
It's on Twitter...

577
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,920
The account is Horse Race Tests...

578
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,860
Yeah...

579
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,020
Just look it up...

580
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,220
And there's like so much art of it and everything.

581
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,660
It's just kind of... Where did it come from?

582
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,520
I don't... I don't know anything that's happening.

583
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,760
I don't... I don't... I don't actually... I'm not as chronically online as I think some people think I am.

584
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,120
So... And especially recently, I've been so busy.

585
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,320
I go to Twitter, I was like... What is this?

586
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,820
I will be financially...

587
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,900
irresponsible all on my own.

588
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,980
That is your decision in panic.

589
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm not gonna be... I'm not your mom.

590
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,000
Pressing X to Dow.

591
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,760
I'm not!

592
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,480
What?

593
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,600
No, I've been so busy.

594
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh my gosh.

595
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,840
Can I say this?

596
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,020
Yeah, probably.

597
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,300
I've talked about how I am working on my first ever 3D concert.

598
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,300
And that... And that...

599
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,000
Uh... I will... When I go to Japan next... That... I will be recording for it.

600
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:35,980
Uh... But what you guys don't know... What you guys don't know... Is... I will... I will be gone.

601
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
I actually had to change my dates a little bit.

602
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,400
Because I... I... I... I needed to add one extra day... Of rest.

603
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:49,680
Because on that trip... I will not be... Doing... One... 3D... Recording.

604
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,240
I will not be doing...

605
00:19:51,240 --> 00:20:00,740
Two... I will not be doing... Three... I will be doing... Four... Four... Three D things... While I'm there.

606
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,420
So... Yeah... I've been crazy busy.

607
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,440
Four... Four... I... I was like... I'm gonna make the most of this trip.

608
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:24,300
So... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four... Four...

609
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:31,140
busy, busy, busy, busy, so, yeah!

610
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,320
I have much, much, much to do, and I don't have time to scroll on Twitter.

611
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,180
Will the 3D concert consist of your singing while climbing the stairs?

612
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,620
Gator Ladder.

613
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,740
Let me write down something real quick.

614
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,020
Okay.

615
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,640
You're working so hard, man.

616
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,620
Wow, yeah!

617
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
Discovered you through your VODs of Half-Life.

618
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,640
Oh, thank you!

619
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,300
Black Mesa Remake makes references to the sequels, which you'll miss if you're not caught up.

620
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,600
Oh, so then it would be good for me to play that last.

621
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Thank you so much.

622
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,900
Thank you for the Zoomer chat, I really appreciate it.

623
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,700
Thanks for sticking around.

624
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,740
Speaking of horses, I found a song last week called Half Horse, Half Man.

625
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,160
About a centaur with dating issues.

626
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,740
And it was reminded of me!

627
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,110
Also, thanks, Murphy.

628
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:10,790
Thanks, Gator.

629
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,190
Thank you, guys.

630
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,250
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

631
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,970
We appreciate you working so hard, Minto.

632
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,150
Climbing in 3-hee.

633
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,670
Woo-hoo!

634
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,750
It all, it all...

635
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,250
It wasn't meant to be like this.

636
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,850
At first, it was just two things I was recording, and then it turned into three.

637
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,030
And then it turned into four.

638
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,290
And then I was like, I...

639
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,970
Which is great because, um...

640
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,290
Because of the timing of when I'm going, my plane ticket was very expensive.

641
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,170
So I was like...

642
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,550
I was like, whew!

643
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,250
I at least only have to...

644
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,890
I don't have to keep going multiple, multiple times.

645
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,390
Only twice in June.

646
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,150
So, yeah.

647
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,070
It's a lot of...

648
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,690
I've been dancing a lot.

649
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,530
I've been learning a lot of songs.

650
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:08,790
And then I also have two covers coming out in the next couple of weeks.

651
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,970
So, I have another cover I need to record for.

652
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,550
It's been busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

653
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,810
Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

654
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,810
Wisps eating good.

656
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,150
Anyway.

657
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,870
Shall we?

658
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,670
Shall we continue?

659
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,330
There's a piece of gym equipment that's a laddered treadmill.

660
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,450
Oh, yeah, you're right.

661
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,450
Your streams have been helping me through it.

662
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,250
Have you seen that somebody did your outro, but with...

663
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,850
I did!

664
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,710
With the Half-Life sound effects.

665
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,950
I did see that.

666
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,210
I did see that.

667
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,990
It's so silly.

668
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,450
But I hope you feel better.

669
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,210
Is it Pi-Kest?

670
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,550
Pi-Chest?

671
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,950
Pi-Chest?

672
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,770
Pi-Chest?

673
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,950
Pi-Pi-Pi-Kest?

674
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,510
Because it will make you so much feel better.

675
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:06,970
I hope.

676
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,650
Soon.

677
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,070
Sending my gamer subs.

678
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,030
Boomer Code Savings.

679
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:10,490
Be a Superjet.

680
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,870
Thank you, Korean Ninja.

681
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,570
Thank you.

682
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,090
Thank you for spoiling us with lots of minto.

683
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,150
I'm trying to make up for when I first came back and I had literally nothing planned.

684
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,900
I came back last year and I was just like...

685
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,090
Just shrug.

686
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,410
I have no...

687
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,350
I had nothing.

688
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,370
I'm making up for lost time.

689
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,350
My Yoshi stole my idea.

690
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,630
I could die happy now.

691
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,390
Let's see.

692
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,930
Load game.

693
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,290
I remember, everybody.

694
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:54,450
I remember that with this, I need to go to the right.

695
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:02,030
I remember that we went through the water and I saved my game looking at the...

696
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,070
The water on the right.

697
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,770
And we need to jump into that.

698
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,990
I remember.

699
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,150
I remember.

700
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,710
I remember.

701
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,570
Despite...

702
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,970
Despite everything going on in my brain right now.

703
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,390
I remember.

704
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,290
I didn't even have to watch the VOD for a recap.

705
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,990
Which now that I say it, it sounds suspicious.

706
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,690
But I really didn't.

707
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,130
Okay?

708
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,570
I...

709
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,690
I didn't foregore.

710
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,610
No, no, no.

711
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,630
It's true.

712
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,510
She Septembers.

713
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:43,250
I remember that I have to jump into the...

714
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,650
This one!

715
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,070
Right here.

716
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,350
Oh, wow.

717
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,090
It's literally right where I left off.

718
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,690
Okay.

719
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,410
Okay.

720
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,230
We got our guns.

721
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,090
This is a C4.

722
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,950
This is the mine.

723
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,150
This is a gun and a crowbar.

724
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,410
And we came from here.

725
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,470
Right?

726
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:07,870
Oh!

727
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,010
Yeah, I killed those guys.

728
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,570
Um...

729
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,250
My health is not looking so great.

730
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,150
But, uh...

731
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,510
We'll...

732
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,850
We'll...

733
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,370
We'll...

734
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,030
We'll make it work.

735
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,470
I'm looking at audio real quick.

736
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,490
This should be fun.

737
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:24,670
Oh!

738
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,000
Oh!

739
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,540
Oh my god.

740
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,080
Oh, oh.

741
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,240
Oh, thank goodness.

742
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,040
We're fine.

743
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,060
It's right here.

744
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,680
It's right here.

745
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,520
Okay, okay, okay.

746
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,600
Oh, sorry.

747
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,730
My health is at 100, but my armor is only at 15, so...

748
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,620
Fish and mail.

749
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,480
Okay, okay.

750
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,260
All right, let's go down.

751
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh, oh, oh.

752
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
Oh no, are those...

753
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,960
Are those, um...

754
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,680
Are these guys going to hurt me?

755
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,420
Oh, shoot.

756
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,200
Yeah.

757
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, jeez.

758
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't want to die.

759
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,300
Wait, ow!

760
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,140
I don't want to die!

761
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,260
Uh...

762
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,020
Leeches!

763
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,640
Leeches!

764
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,820
This way.

765
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,860
Down.

766
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,140
Around.

767
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,260
Around.

768
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,920
Oh, loading.

769
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,180
Around town.

770
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,440
Keep going.

771
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,500
Oh, no.

772
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,320
O2 gone.

773
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,080
O2 gone.

774
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,960
O2.

775
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,040
O2.

776
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,920
Dead.

777
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,400
Here.

778
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,720
Where?

779
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Oh, no!

780
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,060
Wait!

781
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,080
Oh, I made it.

782
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,390
What just happened?

783
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,610
Wait, how did my health get to 100?

784
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,000
How did that happen just now?

785
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,240
It comes back?

786
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,700
Oh, I see.

787
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,580
Okay.

788
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,600
Um...

789
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

790
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,620
Can I get through here?

791
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,300
Can I get through here?

792
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,020
Doesn't seem like it.

793
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,600
Uh...

794
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,260
Andragos, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

795
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,860
Thank you!

796
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,540
Sorry.

797
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,500
Also, if my mouse jerks around a little bit, it's plugged up right now because it was, uh...

798
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,940
Oh, I have to crouch through there.

799
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,340
Okay, okay.

800
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,680
It's plugged up because it was dying.

801
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,180
Ah!

802
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:51,880
Okay.

803
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,020
Ah!

804
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,460
Okay.

805
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,600
I think we're good.

806
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,740
We're not good.

807
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,840
I think I went the wrong way.

808
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,740
Oh, I'm lost.

809
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,640
I'm gonna die!

810
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,240
No!

811
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,040
No!

812
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,900
In here.

813
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,540
No.

814
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,110
Everything's okay!

815
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,570
Everything's fine.

816
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,450
Don't worry about it.

817
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,690
Not even close.

818
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,850
Yeah, not even close.

819
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,890
I'm gonna get my gun ready.

820
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,350
What was that?

821
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,950
Was that a naked man?

822
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,840
Thank you for all your hard work, Vito.

823
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,500
Thank you!

824
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay, there's something in the water.

825
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,350
I saw him.

826
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:17,850
Fish!

827
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,810
Is it time to fish?

828
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,670
Oh, there he goes.

829
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,050
Oh, he's so fast.

830
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,350
He can't get me.

831
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,150
How do I get that?

832
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,130
What the heck is that?

833
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,750
How do I get that thing?

834
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,970
Dave the diver time.

835
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,750
No way.

836
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,970
Oh, it looks like maybe I go up.

837
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,630
Wait, how do I go up?

838
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,370
Over here?

839
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,630
Let's try it.

840
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,650
Did you see it?

841
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,690
See what?

842
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,970
They said it was hauled from the Challenger Deep.

843
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,210
But I'm positive that beast never swam in terrestrial waters until a week ago.

844
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,930
There's a tranquilizer gun in the shark cage.

845
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,670
But I'm not sure it would work on this species.

846
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,270
You are welcome to try.

847
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:14,910
I think it'll work.

848
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,270
Probably.

849
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:16,890
Oh, no.

850
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,100
All right.

851
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,390
Let's go.

852
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,490
Don't mind me.

853
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,570
I'm balancing.

854
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,510
What if I use my gun on it, too?

855
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,110
I mean, guns are pretty effective, you know?

856
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,870
Wait, so it's a tranquilizer, but it looks like a crossbow.

857
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,530
Oh, my God.

858
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,030
Okay.

859
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,210
Nice.

860
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,510
All right.

861
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,630
Come here, little fish.

862
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,390
How do I get out of here?

863
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,860
What the hell is this?

864
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,620
Oh, gosh.

865
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,520
I'm stuck in the water?

866
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:08,840
Okay.

867
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,040
What the hell is this?

868
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,560
Can I move in this thing?

869
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:19,820
No.

870
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,460
Oh, God.

871
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,900
This is kind of silly.

872
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:23,520
Wait.

873
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,940
Am I even hitting it?

874
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,760
I think this is kind of silly.

875
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,320
Uh-oh.

876
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,060
Okay.

877
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,560
You got it at least once.

878
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,780
Do I...

879
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,460
Can I use my other guns to kill this thing?

880
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,080
Just use the pistol?

881
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:02,720
Underwater?

882
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:02,920
No.

883
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,040
Oh, it doesn't work underwater.

884
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:04,780
I see.

885
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:05,960
Wait.

886
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,480
Actually...

887
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,960
Oh, there it is.

888
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,520
Let me try it then.

889
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,100
Where are you?

890
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,740
I'm afraid.

891
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,600
What if it breaks though?

892
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,760
Hello?

893
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,840
Um...

894
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,900
Can I...

895
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,600
Can I do this on it?

896
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,060
Wait.

897
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,990
Actually, let's do...

898
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,390
Is it this one?

899
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

900
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,330
Where is he?

901
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,590
Let's use the...

902
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,210
Let's use the...

903
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,910
I don't want to move because it's going to drive me through the water.

904
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,070
There.

905
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,370
Um...

906
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,610
Okay.

907
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,510
Oh!

908
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,770
Maybe that worked!

909
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,350
Maybe that helped.

910
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,990
Maybe...

911
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,210
Oh!

912
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:02,950
Oops.

913
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,150
No.

914
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,550
Wait.

915
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:03,870
There we go.

916
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,070
Okay.

917
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,070
It didn't...

918
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,750
How do we know?

919
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,070
How do we know?

920
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,270
How...

921
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,890
You didn't...

922
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:11,110
Oh.

923
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,690
Where is he?

924
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,410
Where'd he go?

925
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,270
Where...

926
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,050
Where...

927
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,370
We'll...

928
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,070
We'll get his ass.

929
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,850
We'll get his ass.

930
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,510
Okay.

931
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,430
I give up.

932
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,310
All right.

933
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,630
I'm gonna save.

934
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:38,850
Oh!

935
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:39,570
Wait.

936
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:39,990
I'm stuck.

937
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,210
Wait.

938
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,570
That was sweet salvation for a moment.

939
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:08,650
Wait.

940
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,600
I thought...

941
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:11,860
Oh!

942
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,400
Please!

943
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,460
Please leave me alone!

944
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,340
Please leave me alone!

945
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,870
Somehow...

946
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,090
Somehow I made it!

947
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,560
Somehow we...

948
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
We did it!

949
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,870
Oh golly!

950
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,570
Yeah!

951
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,310
Yeah.

952
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,890
I didn't panic even once.

953
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,190
What was you...

954
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,750
What are you talking about?

955
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,430
Uh...

956
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,730
Oh.

957
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:58,770
Oh.

958
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,550
What are you talking about, huh?

959
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,230
Wait.

960
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:01,410
Wait.

961
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:01,770
Why did it...

962
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,090
There we go.

963
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,170
I guess I gotta go down.

964
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:11,710
Okay.

965
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,330
Oh!

966
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:12,870
Here we go.

967
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,450
Maybe.

968
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,140
What is this?

969
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,170
Mr. Scientist?

970
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,230
He'll be fine, right?

971
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,190
Oh, it's crossbow ammo.

972
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:37,770
Ah, I see.

973
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,170
Oh, wait.

974
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:40,990
Let's save.

975
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,930
Oh, this is evil.

976
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,070
Oh, this is evil.

977
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,550
This is so nasty.

978
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,410
Don't like that.

979
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,010
Reload.

980
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,270
Someone juxtaposed this clip with MGS1 Snake beating the Heinen.

981
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:04,390
Oh man.

982
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,150
No.

983
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,470
No.

984
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,750
Fragging about it to Otacon.

985
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,020
Oh.

986
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,480
Oh.

987
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,830
Okay.

988
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,810
I'm just gonna keep getting all these guys.

989
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,950
I don't like them.

990
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,850
I don't like them.

991
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:26,950
Barnacles.

992
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,430
Let's get my ammo.

993
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,560
Oh wait.

994
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,160
I already saved.

995
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,420
Oh my gosh.

996
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,080
I should have known better.

997
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,980
I should have known better.

998
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,610
Okay.

999
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,670
Now they're all taken care of.

1000
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,950
If I go down there, will I be ambushed?

1001
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,270
Everyone falls for it.

1002
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,810
Slippery.

1003
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:21,870
Maybe.

1004
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:28,850
Ouch!

1005
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,980
I need the medical attention.

1006
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,740
Half-life.

1007
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,760
Less than half-life.

1008
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,600
Maybe it wasn't worth it.

1009
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,960
Quarter life.

1010
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,520
Maybe it wasn't worth it.

1011
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,260
Wait.

1012
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:57,800
Oh, oh.

1013
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,260
Slippery.

1014
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,620
Slippery.

1015
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:58,960
Slippery.

1016
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,340
Slippery.

1017
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,120
Where am I?

1018
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1019
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,300
Okay, okay.

1020
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,280
Careful.

1021
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:08,600
Careful.

1022
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:09,960
Careful.

1023
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,160
Oh.

1024
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,090
Wait, is there another machine?

1025
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,070
Or monster in here?

1026
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,370
Wait, what is this?

1027
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,310
Oh my god.

1028
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,050
There's two of them.

1029
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:39,850
Okay.

1030
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,310
All right.

1031
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,010
All right.

1032
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,170
All right.

1033
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,630
Maybe this is best then.

1034
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,810
Maybe revolver is best then.

1035
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,110
I don't have so many bullets, but as long as I don't fall into the water, right?

1036
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,010
I'll be okay.

1037
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,030
Maybe.

1038
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:09,630
Okay.

1039
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,930
I know there's gonna be somebody else that shows up.

1040
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,870
I'll be over

1041
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:42,530
there.

1042
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,750
I'm so cute.

1043
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,490
Yeah.

1044
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,710
Okay, okay, we're fine.

1045
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,750
Yeah, save now, so true.

1046
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,930
Wait, I will save once we get to the other side.

1047
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,450
Right here, here, here, baby.

1048
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,650
He's gone.

1049
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,790
We don't have to worry about him.

1050
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,590
Okay, and...

1051
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,130
Nice.

1052
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,130
Nice, and then this seems pretty, I have to like, what, crouch jump?

1053
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,210
Or do I jump from this side?

1054
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,550
No.

1055
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,810
Or I could, wait.

1056
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,470
Okay.

1057
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,420
Oh, hello.

1058
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,180
I feel like I have to, let me try from here.

1059
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,640
Oh, uh...

1060
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,540
Don't look at me.

1061
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,260
Can you shoot the cable?

1062
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,440
We could try.

1063
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,620
No.

1064
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,940
No, unfortunately.

1065
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,420
He's looking right at me, I don't know.

1066
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:18,540
No.

1067
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:19,700
Creep.

1068
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,100
Oh, oh.

1069
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:21,960
I'm so close.

1070
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,320
Wait, don't come.

1071
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:23,880
Don't come here.

1072
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,880
Don't come over here.

1073
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,340
Please.

1074
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,600
I'm so close.

1075
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,860
Just use your arm.

1076
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,580
Gordon Freeman!

1077
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,460
Gordon Freeman!

1078
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,280
Gordon Freeman!

1079
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,810
Is it a crouch jump on that part?

1080
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,830
Or is it a crouch jump here?

1081
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:43,910
Or...

1082
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,510
Okay.

1083
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,350
Okay.

1084
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,490
All right.

1085
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,990
Crouch jump everywhere.

1086
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,270
Got to use the slip and slide.

1087
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,130
Oh, to get into this?

1088
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,030
Oh, like a...

1089
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,690
Oh...

1090
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,670
Like a diagonal?

1091
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,190
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1092
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,270
Then I should be...

1093
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,190
Oh.

1094
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,570
Okay, yeah, I got a crouch.

1095
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:11,590
Leave me there.

1096
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,390
Don't you growl at me.

1097
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,990
Oh my gosh, the runway.

1098
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:38,650
Now debuting Minky's latest design.

1099
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,210
Oh.

1100
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,550
Let's go.

1101
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,330
Let's heckin' go.

1102
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,000
No leeches.

1103
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,660
No leeches.

1104
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,220
No leeches.

1105
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,080
Oh my gosh.

1106
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,690
Who is that?

1107
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,910
I got him.

1108
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,070
That was G-Man, wasn't it?

1109
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,970
Why is he so obsessed with me?

1110
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,290
I think I saw something else over there.

1111
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,350
I want to try this thing.

1112
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,430
Oh, this guy is pretty good, huh?

1113
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,960
He broke the rope.

1114
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,380
He does want me so bad.

1115
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,600
Obsessive behavior.

1116
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,560
Hold on.

1117
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,650
We can make that!

1118
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,770
What?

1119
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,070
What just... what just appeared?

1120
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:08,810
Okay.

1121
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,050
I'm leaving.

1122
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:11,890
I'm leaving.

1123
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,230
Generator control.

1124
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,150
I'm leaving.

1125
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:23,870
I don't want to save just because I accidentally took that one hit.

1126
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,350
And so, just in case.

1127
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,330
You know what I mean?

1128
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,210
If I can get more health, then I will save.

1129
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,070
But for now...

1130
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,930
For now, I don't want to do it just yet.

1131
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:37,370
Beep.

1132
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:37,890
Beep.

1133
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,190
What did I do?

1134
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,290
Whoa!

1135
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,870
Oh, it's a headcrab!

1136
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,410
It's my sister and Mai's birthday!

1137
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,130
Can I get a happy birthday?

1138
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:53,850
Of course!

1139
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,050
Here, let me get out of this noisy room.

1140
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,610
Make a manual save true!

1141
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,290
Mai!

1142
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,190
I heard it's your birthday!

1143
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:12,190
Happy, happy birthday to you!

1144
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,490
Thank you so much, Bilal!

1145
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,190
Thank you!

1146
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,530
Happy birthday to your sister!

1147
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:24,790
Okay.

1148
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,390
The fire on the crossbow is a sniper scope.

1149
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:32,990
Really?

1150
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:33,370
Wait.

1151
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,950
No way!

1152
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,630
What's going on down here?

1153
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,110
Oh!

1154
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,570
Oh!

1155
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:42,810
It's dark!

1156
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,410
I don't like that!

1157
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,390
Wait.

1158
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:46,510
It's so dark in there.

1159
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,920
More ammo.

1160
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,480
I'll take it.

1161
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:54,840
Flashlight!

1162
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,200
Oh yeah!

1163
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,000
I do have a flashlight!

1164
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:56,620
You're so right!

1165
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,620
I'm scared!

1166
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,000
Man, you will save.

1167
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,380
In case I get ambushed.

1168
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:12,570
Whoa!

1169
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,180
You know what?

1170
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,220
This is good enough.

1171
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,100
Nice.

1172
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:19,440
Okay.

1173
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,200
All right.

1174
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:21,780
Okay.

1175
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,660
All right.

1176
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,740
Time to platform, baby!

1177
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,420
Do I need that?

1178
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,920
Does this push too?

1179
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,220
Do I need these?

1180
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,640
I sure hope not.

1181
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,360
Not time to get squished!

1182
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,580
Oh.

1183
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,640
Wait!

1184
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,260
What happened?

1185
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,160
Huh?

1186
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,260
How did I...

1187
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,980
How did that happen to me?

1188
00:47:58,470 --> 00:47:59,850
I jumped into the squisher.

1189
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:03,410
How could this happen to me?

1190
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,030
How could this happen to me?

1191
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:22,530
So close.

1192
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,130
So stinking close.

1193
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:29,970
Greedy?

1194
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:30,590
Yeah, little.

1195
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,010
Yeah, little.

1196
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,740
Yeah, little.

1197
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,870
Hi, Karim!

1198
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:51,230
Whoa!

1199
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,150
Thank you so much!

1200
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,950
I'm with the science team.

1201
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,430
Thank you so much for the Huckazoo one!

1202
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,070
Thank you!

1203
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,250
Okay, let's switch back to a revolver.

1204
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,050
Or crossbow is pretty good too.

1205
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:18,290
Wait a second.

1206
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:18,510
Wait a second.

1207
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,330
I want to redo that.

1208
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,870
I want to redo that.

1209
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,390
You jerk!

1210
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,930
He shoots so fast!

1211
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,710
He shoots so fast!

1212
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,090
10 HP do-o-o-roar!

1213
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,430
Yeah!

1214
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,590
I mean it's everything!

1215
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:48,170
Everything!

1216
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:48,870
Okay.

1217
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,090
I dodged it.

1218
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,830
And then...

1219
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,030
Plant a mine!

1220
00:49:59,210 --> 00:49:59,530
Oh!

1221
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,030
That's so smart!

1222
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,230
What?

1223
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:03,570
Okay, hold on.

1224
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,230
Maybe like this one?

1225
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,930
Wait, where does he spawn?

1226
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,010
Like here?

1227
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,260
I don't think it worked.

1228
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,780
He's too small!

1229
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,210
I didn't want to do this before because I didn't know.

1230
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,230
Well, I guess I...

1231
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,010
I don't know.

1232
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,710
I placed it too high!

1233
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,770
We're not heading back there, right?

1234
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:50,890
Are we?

1235
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,470
We don't need to go back, right?

1236
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:56,650
No?

1237
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:57,510
Okay, then.

1238
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:58,610
We're fine.

1239
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,490
Let's keep going.

1240
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,370
The trip mines are not effective.

1241
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,970
The creature is mint-o-sized.

1242
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,090
Hey, hey, hey.

1243
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,410
What if...

1244
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:25,790
But actually, what if one of those guys does show up, you know?

1245
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,530
I see him right there.

1246
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:28,930
I think I can get him.

1247
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,090
Oh my god, look at his eyeball.

1248
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:36,950
What if...

1249
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:40,130
What if the army shows up and I do get them?

1250
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:42,770
With the bob?

1251
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:42,990
You know.

1252
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,590
With the bob.

1253
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,110
Who knows?

1254
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:47,670
We don't know.

1255
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,090
We don't know.

1256
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,350
Kinda like the crossbow.

1257
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,390
Kinda like...

1258
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,950
Did I just see someone walk in?

1259
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,230
Wait, did I just see something walk in?

1260
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,590
I don't know.

1261
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,050
Oh, there's a man!

1262
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,980
Welcome to the Crossbow Club.

1263
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,020
Hey, cute.

1264
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,240
Alright.

1265
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,100
Oh, how are you alive?

1266
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,720
Yes.

1267
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,420
The science team has been tracking your progress with the Black Mesa security system.

1268
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,740
Unfortunately, so is the military.

1269
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,400
That suit of yours is full of tracking devices.

1270
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,360
Still, it's better than going naked in this place.

1271
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:38,960
Naked?

1272
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,400
It's cold in there, and you'll have to hurry.

1273
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,380
It could sap your suit power in a matter of moments.

1274
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:51,400
If you're bent on reaching the Lambda complex, then you'll want to keep to the older industrial areas where the security system is full of holes.

1275
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:51,900
Okay.

1276
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,600
Someone's in the walls.

1277
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,000
Who am I hearing?

1278
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,920
Wait, so where do I need to go?

1279
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,440
Through here?

1280
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,340
Someone's in the walls, mister.

1281
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,860
Wait, what did I just do?

1282
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,320
Sorry.

1283
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,040
I think I destroyed...

1284
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,980
I activated the button.

1285
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,760
Oh, it's an eye scan.

1286
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,560
Oh, okay.

1287
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,040
Wait, so...

1288
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,180
Beep, beep, beep, boop, boop, boop.

1289
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,140
How?

1290
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,420
Where do I...

1291
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,200
Behind him?

1292
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:37,740
Oh, oh!

1293
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,400
I got it!

1294
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,800
Yeah, I think you should stay here.

1295
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,500
I don't think you should come with.

1296
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,580
I don't think you should come with me.

1297
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,160
I'm scared.

1298
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
Save, I already did.

1299
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,760
I did save, I did.

1300
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,320
Oh my goodness.

1301
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,680
Why is it so shaky?

1302
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,300
Wait, why is it like this?

1303
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,140
Oh, because I'm cold?

1304
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,340
Oh my gosh.

1305
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,420
Is this like a...

1306
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,220
Run through it kind of area?

1307
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:20,810
Uh...

1308
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:21,570
Go, go, go, go.

1309
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,250
Am I still cold?

1310
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:24,890
What?

1311
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,910
Okay, I'm not cold anymore.

1312
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,230
Yippee!

1313
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,690
Okay, uh...

1314
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,790
I only lost a little bit of armor.

1315
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:38,770
But...

1316
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,610
Okay, uh...

1317
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,070
Go down.

1318
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:40,530
There we go.

1319
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,370
Anything around here?

1320
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,650
Why is it so...

1321
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,550
Feels so ominous?

1322
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,630
Any items?

1323
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,050
Any items?

1324
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:56,790
Any items?

1325
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,250
Any items?

1326
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,810
No, okay.

1327
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:02,250
Hush chat?

1328
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,310
Wait, what do you guys say?

1329
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,410
If you guys see spoilers, I have a spoiler policy.

1330
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,230
Where, um...

1331
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,490
Where if you see spoilers, you can do a smiley face.

1332
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:15,710
And it shows me that there are spoilers in the chat so I don't look.

1333
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,470
And also, it helps push the comment off the screen.

1334
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,930
So that I...

1335
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:21,910
Um...

1336
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:22,570
Don't see it.

1337
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:23,970
On accident.

1338
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:28,450
But typically, in these types of games, I'm always like...

1339
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,710
My brain is, you know...

1340
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:31,330
Focused.

1341
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,530
So I'm sorry if I don't see chat very easily.

1342
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,990
Uh-oh, why is it giving me health?

1343
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,070
Oh, oh boy.

1344
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,070
I'm scared.

1345
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:39,470
Oh!

1346
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,550
I just like smiley faces.

1347
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,270
I can't spoil what I've never seen before.

1348
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,350
Yeah, I can see...

1349
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:57,830
There you go.

1350
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:58,930
Okay.

1351
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,370
Uh...

1352
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,500
I'm just...

1353
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,740
There's more health?

1354
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:22,850
Ah!

1355
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:23,850
Shit!

1356
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:24,330
Ah!

1357
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:25,010
Screw you!

1358
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,780
I like the way they run at me.

1359
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,400
Ugh!

1360
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,120
I guess I could grab the health.

1361
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,300
Oh, wait.

1362
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,260
I'm back to Crowbar.

1363
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,440
It's fine.

1364
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:44,860
We're fine.

1365
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,260
Oh my gosh!

1366
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,280
There's so much health!

1367
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,840
Do we come back here?

1368
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,580
Or...

1369
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,380
Yes.

1370
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,870
You can?

1371
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,430
No.

1372
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,430
Just go?

1373
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:06,870
Okay.

1374
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,690
Okay, I'll trust you guys.

1375
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,250
Oh, yeah.

1376
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:13,930
It's an elevator.

1377
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,610
Oh, Barney!

1378
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:23,630
Oh, Barney!

1379
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,010
Make sure you don't...

1380
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,070
Who?

1381
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,290
He was supposed to be...

1382
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:38,950
Safe!

1383
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:40,830
Barney!

1384
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:41,570
I should've...

1385
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:42,770
I should've...

1386
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,470
I should've stayed in front of him!

1387
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,150
I didn't shoot him!

1388
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,230
It wasn't me!

1389
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,850
It wasn't me!

1390
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,650
Are we gonna be fighting against a sniper?

1391
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,410
Oh my god.

1392
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,550
Ah!

1393
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:13,450
Holy hell.

1394
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:14,850
Oh my god.

1395
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:16,790
Ah!

1396
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,910
What the hell?

1397
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,380
Oh!

1398
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,260
Sexy lady!

1399
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,160
Wait, there's more of them.

1400
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,800
I think?

1401
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,880
Are you a sexy lady?

1402
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,000
That's a generator?

1403
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,440
Hi, Dak!

1404
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,060
Uh...

1405
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,840
Uh...

1406
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,040
Just got hope from work and got back on the stream.

1407
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,140
Barney instantly dies!

1408
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:44,560
No!

1409
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,180
Oh my

1410
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:52,130
god.

1411
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,210
This is on normal easy...

1412
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,470
Yeah, it's on normal mode.

1413
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,790
How many are there?

1414
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,270
She was so fast.

1415
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:07,230
Okay!

1416
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,580
Um...

1417
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,040
Ma'am?

1418
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,150
Use the shotgun.

1419
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:24,930
Is it better?

1420
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:27,730
Oh!

1421
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:28,110
Oops.

1422
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,270
Sorry.

1423
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,310
More likely to hit.

1424
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,310
Well, I guess that's true.

1425
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,350
Lady.

1426
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:44,210
Lady.

1427
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:46,750
Lady, where'd you go?

1428
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:48,350
Lady!

1429
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,050
I hear another?

1430
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:09,910
Just like your friend.

1431
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,830
Where are you?

1432
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,190
Where are you?

1433
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,290
Where are you?

1434
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,110
She's on...

1435
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:17,410
She's coming.

1436
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:18,490
She's on her way.

1437
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:19,510
She's almost here.

1438
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,770
She's so close.

1439
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,230
I don't know why she walked up.

1440
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:36,610
But...

1441
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:37,610
Okay.

1442
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,090
Are there any more?

1443
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:44,790
Ladies!

1444
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:45,450
Ladies!

1445
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:46,030
Ladies!

1446
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,470
Let's all calm down now!

1447
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,090
Surface access.

1448
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,510
Okay, yeah.

1449
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,900
She's still warm.

1450
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,760
What do you mean, go for it?

1451
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,720
What do you mean by that?

1452
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,320
Ladies can't resist.

1453
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,200
I forgot my glasses.

1454
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,340
I was like, I'm missing something today.

1455
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,320
Hold on.

1456
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,420
Oh my gosh.

1457
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,040
I completely forgot.

1458
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,280
My glasses.

1459
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,800
I can't see without my glasses.

1460
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,680
There we go.

1461
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,900
I can't believe I forgot.

1462
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,120
Now that's why my aim was so bad and it will be perfect.

1463
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:52,240
No.

1464
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,420
Yes.

1465
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,160
Jinkies.

1466
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,300
Oh wait, let me just get my shotgun.

1467
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,120
Oh.

1468
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:09,780
Oh.

1469
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,840
This is huge.

1470
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,440
Alright.

1471
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,400
I'm just going to keep destroying every box I see now.

1472
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,300
I love the structure.

1473
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,000
Thank you.

1474
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,180
Thank you.

1475
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:29,940
Monalifter.

1476
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,160
Oh my gosh.

1477
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,340
The buff Mona Lisa is insane.

1478
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,420
I'm searching the area.

1479
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,760
Dr. Freeman, now I recognize you.

1480
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,330
Another!

1481
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,170
Wow.

1482
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,290
They're really...

1483
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:59,950
They're like, hey, if that fight was too hard for you...

1484
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,510
Are we gonna...

1485
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,330
Is there more to happen in here?

1486
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,050
I'm so nervous.

1487
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:05,270
Oh my gosh.

1488
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:06,770
Wait, what?

1489
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:09,390
Alarming amount of health.

1490
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,310
Yeah, I'm so...

1491
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:10,990
I'm scared.

1492
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:12,610
I'm scared as hell right now.

1493
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:13,070
Hahaha.

1494
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:15,810
Okay.

1495
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,790
I'm sorry, Barney.

1496
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,350
I'm sorry.

1497
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:26,570
It should've been me.

1498
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,510
I should've been the one to take the hit.

1499
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:32,470
Wait, hold on.

1500
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,310
Oh yeah.

1501
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,310
Let's go up here first.

1502
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:39,310
Okay.

1503
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,410
Does this...

1504
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,330
Oh, that probably opened...

1505
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:42,770
Oh gosh.

1506
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:43,950
It probably opens that up.

1507
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:44,270
Hold on.

1508
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:44,670
Okay.

1509
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,210
Before we do that...

1510
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:48,470
Ah!

1511
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,510
Oh.

1512
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:50,590
Ouch.

1513
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:51,310
I'm stupid.

1514
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:53,390
Um...

1515
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:53,870
Nevermind.

1516
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:54,430
Okay.

1517
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:55,950
Uh...

1518
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,710
We're gonna go in there.

1519
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:58,030
Okay.

1520
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:58,350
Okay.

1521
01:03:59,650 --> 01:03:59,970
Both

1522
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,410
those ninjas go invisible!

1523
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:17,410
That's insane.

1524
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:17,890
Okay.

1525
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,910
Mint failed the quick time event to save Barney.

1526
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:23,410
Joking.

1527
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:23,870
Hahaha.

1528
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,810
Thank you for including the joking part.

1529
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:27,070
Wait.

1530
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,190
Okay.

1531
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,670
Here we go.

1532
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,820
Thank you, Glint.

1533
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,740
Thank you so much.

1534
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,360
I miss Barney already, too.

1535
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,820
Oh, more health?

1536
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:54,820
Why?

1537
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:55,580
Ah!

1538
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:55,640
Ah!

1539
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,680
Get him out.

1540
01:04:59,310 --> 01:04:59,870
Oh!

1541
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:00,590
I'm shooting!

1542
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:02,830
Nice hit.

1543
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:03,970
See what?

1544
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,430
Alright, we got him.

1545
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,070
What?

1546
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:06,970
They got me!

1547
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:25,850
Nap time.

1548
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:28,730
Body.

1549
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:29,950
Wet body.

1550
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:30,750
Hahaha.

1551
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:35,730
No.

1552
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,030
No, I have nothing.

1553
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,310
Not even...

1554
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:39,370
Not even...

1555
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:39,990
I don't have a crowbar.

1556
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:40,450
I have nothing.

1557
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,350
Oh!

1558
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:46,370
Woohoo!

1559
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:49,310
Oh, shoot.

1560
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,950
Oh, it's a double...

1561
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:51,070
Okay.

1562
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:51,850
Double set.

1563
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:52,630
Uh...

1564
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:53,170
Oh my gosh.

1565
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:57,610
Ugh.

1566
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:00,640
Ah!

1567
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,600
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1568
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,180
Oh, dang it.

1569
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,580
I didn't realize I needed to crouch.

1570
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:07,580
Okay.

1571
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:23,650
You psychos!

1572
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:33,900
Uh...

1573
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,920
A door, perhaps?

1574
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,360
Oh!

1575
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,370
There's that.

1576
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:42,550
Uh...

1577
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:43,570
Body?

1578
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:44,550
What body?

1579
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:45,110
I...

1580
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:45,590
Oh my gosh.

1581
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:47,250
I could've totally lived through there.

1582
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:47,750
Hahaha!

1583
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:49,850
Oh, come on!

1584
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,230
I could've totally...

1585
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,510
Wait, what's that on the other side?

1586
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:58,830
I could've totally...

1587
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:03,910
Made that...

1588
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,030
Oh!

1589
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,230
My crowbar!

1590
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:09,770
And then I think we go back to the other, other side.

1591
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:12,890
Oh!

1592
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,430
I'm taking damage, but I have to do that.

1593
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:17,370
Wait.

1594
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,010
Oh.

1595
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:18,870
No, no, no, no.

1596
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:19,330
Go back up.

1597
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,550
There we go.

1598
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,820
Or maybe it's this one down here.

1599
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,340
Oh, the bridge.

1600
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,220
Oh, you're right!

1601
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,440
There totally is a bridge!

1602
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,120
You're right.

1603
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,360
You're right.

1604
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,480
You're right.

1605
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,080
You're right.

1606
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,840
Ah, there we go.

1607
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,410
Ew!

1608
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:07,830
Okay.

1609
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:12,810
I'm outside.

1610
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,870
You're nasty.

1611
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:17,550
Where's all my stuff?

1612
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:19,690
I just got the crossbow!

1613
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:20,590
It was so awesome!

1614
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:22,650
Stinky...

1615
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:24,970
Sewage...

1616
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,340
Come here.

1617
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,800
Will he drown down...

1618
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:43,820
Will he drown down...

1619
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,280
Oh my god!

1620
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,120
The little bubbles!

1621
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,260
Can they breathe underwater?

1622
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:54,860
Or...

1623
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,010
They'll die eventually, no?

1624
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:10,410
It's drowning.

1625
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:10,530
It's drowning.

1626
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,870
This is where the baby head crab learns to swim.

1627
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:21,010
You just gotta throw a baby into the water and it will learn to swim out of necessity.

1628
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,670
Everybody knows that.

1629
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:24,710
Okay.

1630
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,770
Is that a person?

1631
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:29,370
Uh-oh.

1632
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:30,910
Scientist.

1633
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:31,770
Hold on.

1634
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:34,990
I'm gonna check on my mouse real quick because...

1635
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,610
See what it's at.

1636
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:39,530
If it's like close to a hundred, then I'll...

1637
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,170
Oh yeah!

1638
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:41,090
It's at 90%.

1639
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:41,450
Okay, good.

1640
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:42,290
I can unplug it.

1641
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,890
Oh, freedom!

1642
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,330
Sweet freedom.

1643
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,650
Are you okay?

1644
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,890
Oh!

1645
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:53,610
Sorry.

1646
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:55,550
Whoa.

1647
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:56,850
Okay.

1648
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:58,610
Uh...

1649
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:02,290
Do not close outlet without closing intake.

1650
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,470
Not anymore.

1651
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,870
I don't think he was okay though.

1652
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,150
Gonna be honest.

1653
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:18,070
Oh, wait.

1654
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:18,790
Oh, whoops.

1655
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,090
There we go.

1656
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,340
Where did I open?

1657
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:29,540
Oh!

1658
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,990
I didn't notice this ladder.

1659
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:41,630
If I...

1660
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,330
If I jump in there, I'll definitely die.

1661
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:43,670
No.

1662
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,560
What a thrill.

1663
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,010
Where are we, anyway?

1664
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,010
Take a leap.

1665
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:08,390
Okay.

1666
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:12,190
Oh.

1667
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,280
We're probably fine.

1668
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:38,410
Barney!

1669
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,190
Hey, hey!

1670
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:43,990
Where are you going?

1671
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1672
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,250
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy!

1673
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:50,950
You think he's okay?

1674
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:51,750
Where'd he go?

1675
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:53,410
Um...

1676
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:55,350
Uh...

1677
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,190
Do I still only have...

1678
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,060
What's in here?

1679
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,720
Uh...

1680
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,100
Whoa!

1681
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,220
Whoa!

1682
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,060
Would I lead to this if I had not opened the thing?

1683
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,600
Soup.

1684
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,280
That's green pea soup, probably.

1685
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,010
Why did he run from me?

1686
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,030
The ceiling particle god?

1687
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,510
Why did he run from me, though?

1688
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:29,970
There's more of them.

1689
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:40,130
These were always here, and I just didn't notice.

1690
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:43,670
No, Bardi.

1691
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:47,310
Buddy.

1692
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,550
That was Bardi's leg.

1693
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,930
I'm going to do a new save.

1694
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,910
Was I supposed to take so much damage dropping from there?

1695
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:03,710
Because, uh...

1696
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,330
Oh, there's nothing here.

1697
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,570
No, you weren't!

1698
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:09,590
What?

1699
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,130
Why did I take so much damage, then?

1700
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,770
Oh, the va...

1701
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,490
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1702
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,210
Should I redo it, then?

1703
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:26,610
Hmm.

1704
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,960
Would it be worth redoing?

1705
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:33,540
No?

1706
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:40,390
Oh, well, we'll just...

1707
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,710
We'll just keep going for now.

1708
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,490
High radiation area.

1709
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,230
I'm running out of bullets.

1710
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:53,630
Whoop!

1711
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:02,790
More bullets!

1712
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,890
Please!

1713
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:05,870
Any in here?

1714
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:06,810
None?

1715
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,310
Okay.

1716
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:09,930
Let me go back upstairs.

1717
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,470
Real quick.

1718
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,070
Check out what's going on in here.

1719
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:15,930
Any bullets?

1720
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:22,800
What the hell is going on in here?

1721
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,520
Where are we?

1722
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,340
Okie dokie.

1723
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,900
I guess I just gotta go inside.

1724
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,500
Not enough bullets.

1725
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,240
Never mind.

1726
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,980
Never mind.

1727
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,520
Parkour time?

1728
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,640
I guess so?

1729
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,940
Where do I parkour from, though?

1730
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,900
There's more health down there.

1731
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,180
I think we go...

1732
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:55,980
Uh...

1733
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:58,620
Where do I parkour from?

1734
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,000
The soup!

1735
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,020
There's bowls of soup everywhere!

1736
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:06,900
Oh!

1737
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:07,880
Observation area?

1738
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,600
Oh, observation area?

1739
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,680
Oh, wait.

1740
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,680
That's where I was at.

1741
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:13,380
Hahaha.

1742
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,730
Oh, I think I go from here into there!

1743
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:26,130
Oh, that's pretty...

1744
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:27,790
Woo!

1745
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:30,050
Up!

1746
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,210
I thought so earlier, but I was like, no!

1747
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:37,090
Surely not!

1748
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:39,530
Okay.

1749
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,640
Can I get in, please?

1750
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,620
Haha.

1751
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,780
I'm crouched.

1752
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:49,500
Oh!

1753
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,300
Oh!

1754
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,700
Alright.

1755
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,080
Let's...

1756
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:56,620
We don't...

1757
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,720
We'll save our bullets.

1758
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:58,800
For right now.

1759
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,220
Good platforming.

1760
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:03,780
Thank you.

1761
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:14,490
Okay.

1762
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:15,490
Hold on.

1763
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:16,470
Let's observe.

1764
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,040
Before we...

1765
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,800
Um...

1766
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,960
So, almost everything else is the same.

1767
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,060
Except this middle one and that back one.

1768
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:32,720
Oh...

1769
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,000
It's simpler than it looks, is it really?

1770
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,060
Wait.

1771
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,400
Now they're getting all out of sync.

1772
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:38,040
Wait a second.

1773
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:38,660
Hahaha.

1774
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,000
Mari!

1775
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:42,580
Mari!

1776
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,200
Happy birthday!

1777
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,080
Happy, happy birthday!

1778
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,420
Okay.

1779
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:52,720
Alright.

1780
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,920
Let's wait for...

1781
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,400
This guy to come up.

1782
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,050
And then we'll...

1783
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:58,960
Uh...

1784
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:01,540
Oh...

1785
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,760
Oh my god!

1786
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:04,940
Hahaha!

1787
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:07,650
I did it!

1788
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,180
Tuh-heh.

1789
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:19,940
Nice.

1790
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:20,560
Yeah!

1791
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:22,380
Oh.

1792
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:36,640
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

1793
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,020
Okay.

1794
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,400
All right.

1795
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,400
So far so good.

1796
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,260
So far so good.

1797
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,480
Sus pipe.

1798
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,020
Yeah.

1799
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:01,330
Okay.

1800
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,910
I see the health down there.

1801
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,210
Oh.

1802
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:03,630
Wait.

1803
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:04,430
We can get to it.

1804
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:06,530
Oh.

1805
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:07,290
Oh.

1806
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,610
Phew.

1807
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:11,510
Maintenance access.

1808
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:12,590
Oh, does this...

1809
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:13,790
Is this from the other side?

1810
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:18,610
Oh, nice.

1811
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:19,030
Okay.

1812
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,670
Does this...

1813
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:21,750
Will this unlock?

1814
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:26,720
Aha!

1815
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,650
Whoa, Zachary!

1816
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:33,630
Thank you so much!

1817
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:35,970
Got your plush in recently!

1818
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:36,770
Thank you!

1819
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:38,970
Thank you so, so much!

1820
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:40,270
I really appreciate it!

1821
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,510
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1822
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:43,790
All right, all right!

1823
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:51,790
Okay!

1824
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:57,330
Uuuh!

1825
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:07,010
Guys, I don't know how I did that, but...

1826
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:10,970
Uh...

1827
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,570
Yippee!

1828
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:21,940
Woohoo!

1829
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,080
I don't know how I did that.

1830
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:33,960
Who just...

1831
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,640
Who...

1832
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,460
Who what?

1833
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,600
What was that?

1834
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,900
It was a Barney.

1835
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,300
It couldn't have been.

1836
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,400
Okay, I...

1837
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,650
I gotta go to the little ghosties room real quick, you guys.

1838
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:49,210
Is that okay?

1839
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:50,810
I'll be right back.

1840
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,250
I just gotta...

1841
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:52,830
I gotta...

1842
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,310
I'll be right back.

1843
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:58,130
And I'm gonna get some more tea as well.

1844
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,130
Drunk dinner...

1845
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,490
You can just listen to this...

1846
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:02,710
Factory...

1847
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,310
Ambiance...

1848
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:06,130
ASMR...

1849
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:06,490
ASMR...

1850
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,310
It sounds so...

1851
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,710
Industrial...

1852
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:12,250
Yeah!

1853
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:13,310
Okay, I'll be right back.

1854
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:44,010
I'm back!

1855
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:46,350
I'm back!

1856
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:47,190
I'm back!

1857
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,630
There's so much more blood on the ground than before!

1858
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,670
Am I supposed to go up there?

1859
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:54,310
Wee!

1860
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,480
What if I...

1861
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,080
Want the boxes, though?

1862
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:02,420
Oh.

1863
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,320
More chunks coming out.

1864
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:04,740
Wait.

1865
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:05,980
What if...

1866
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:06,640
Is there stuff in here?

1867
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:06,880
Oh!

1868
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,420
See, see, see!

1869
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,560
This is why we check.

1870
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,060
Welcome back!

1871
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:11,660
Thank you!

1872
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,080
More ammo...

1873
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,220
Oh!

1874
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,580
And some first aid?

1875
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,140
Okay.

1876
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:17,920
I'll take it.

1877
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,780
Go get the boxes then.

1878
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,340
I will!

1879
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,100
Oh.

1880
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:22,860
Oh.

1881
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:23,220
Oh.

1882
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,700
I'm too speedy.

1883
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:25,900
There we go.

1884
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,380
Alright.

1885
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,520
Let's go for our little ride.

1886
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:30,860
Ne-hee-hee.

1887
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,080
Oh.

1888
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:34,660
Uh.

1889
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,130
Okay.

1890
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:43,010
Uh.

1891
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:44,850
Let's go down here.

1892
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:46,410
Oh.

1893
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:48,030
Caution.

1894
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:49,290
Yes.

1895
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:51,250
There is a caution.

1896
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:53,070
What do I hear?

1897
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,150
Okay, I don't hear anything.

1898
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:55,550
Never mind.

1899
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,710
Swimming time.

1900
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:01,330
Oh, fire even?

1901
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,470
Okay.

1902
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,370
I'm gonna get my gun out just in case.

1903
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:17,990
Many...

1904
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:19,510
Many things that will kill us.

1905
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,650
Many things that will kill us.

1906
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:24,610
Like fire.

1907
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,030
And...

1908
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:28,630
There's so many chunks being rained on us even.

1909
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,870
Oh.

1910
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,250
Crawl, crawl, crawl.

1911
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:34,430
Up, up, up.

1912
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:35,290
Up, up, up.

1913
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:36,590
Up, up, up.

1914
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:37,290
Wait, what's happening?

1915
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:38,150
Why can't I go up?

1916
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:39,410
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1917
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:40,570
What's happening?

1918
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:41,610
Why can't I go up?

1919
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,310
Oh my god.

1920
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,350
Oh, yeah.

1921
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:45,050
Okay.

1922
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:45,950
Oh.

1923
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:46,750
Oh.

1924
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:47,830
That was close.

1925
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:52,030
There's a roof there.

1926
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:54,970
Alright.

1927
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:56,490
But we are...

1928
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:56,550
We're...

1929
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:57,890
We were not deterred.

1930
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:12,390
I just hear all the crushing.

1931
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:14,270
Nothing over here?

1932
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:14,510
Okay.

1933
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,250
Let's go.

1934
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,250
Did I come in here before?

1935
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,150
Uh, no.

1936
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:35,710
No, I did not.

1937
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:37,430
Wait.

1938
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:39,790
Yes.

1939
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:41,010
Yes, I did.

1940
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,250
Yeah, this is where I fell in.

1941
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:55,530
What if I go through here?

1942
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:56,590
Ah!

1943
01:26:57,450 --> 01:26:58,450
I see.

1944
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:59,070
Okay.

1945
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:00,430
Uh, let's see.

1946
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:02,790
Door crossed on the other side.

1947
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:03,990
Yeah, I was locked.

1948
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,610
So let's go back in here and get blown by the fan.

1949
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:15,430
Oh.

1950
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:16,310
Oh.

1951
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:16,870
Oh.

1952
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:16,990
Oh.

1953
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:17,990
Mm-hmm.

1954
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,720
What is going on in there?

1955
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,480
Oh.

1956
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,880
That's what's going on in there.

1957
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:27,760
Ouch!

1958
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,380
Forgot how many hits these guys take.

1959
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:36,820
Party!

1960
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,440
We've only seen two parties.

1961
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,360
This is the stream!

1962
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,640
And both of them!

1963
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,360
Both single times!

1964
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,040
Dude!

1965
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:51,310
Oh my god, I got my revolver back.

1966
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:52,730
Three?

1967
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:54,650
No, I think only two, no?

1968
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,730
At least three dead...

1969
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:03,950
It's not my fault, though.

1970
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:09,270
Push, push.

1971
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:09,690
Hold on.

1972
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:12,590
I want to open that up first.

1973
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,890
Alright, now we push, push.

1974
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:17,770
Push, push, push, push, push.

1975
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:18,670
Push, push.

1976
01:28:18,930 --> 01:28:19,150
Okay.

1977
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:19,870
Push, push.

1978
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,190
Uh, right here.

1979
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,370
What'd that do?

1980
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:30,960
What'd that do?

1981
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,250
It stopped everything?

1982
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:38,790
Oh.

1983
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,750
It stopped the squishers?

1984
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:42,970
Um.

1985
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:45,090
Do we have...

1986
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,270
Different eyes?

1987
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,630
Or...

1988
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:50,450
Oh, I see!

1989
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:51,310
I see!

1990
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:55,570
It stops them for a tad.

1991
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:56,250
Okay, let's see.

1992
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:57,070
Okay, okay, okay.

1993
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:00,790
Okay.

1994
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:01,450
Yes, we do.

1995
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:04,130
Okay, okay.

1996
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,980
I messed up.

1997
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,350
My special eyes.

1998
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:19,550
Look.

1999
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:20,150
Oh, wait.

2000
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:22,350
Oh.

2001
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:22,690
Ah!

2002
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:29,040
Oh my god.

2003
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:34,940
Die!

2004
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,800
Why didn't I notice this before?

2005
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:50,320
Coming up.

2006
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,520
Is this...

2007
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,360
Controlling...

2008
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,100
Wait, I'm stuck.

2009
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,800
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

2010
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:58,780
Wait, I'm stuck.

2011
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,400
Uh, you guys.

2012
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,180
I can't move.

2013
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:02,720
Uh.

2014
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:04,180
Uh.

2015
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,660
I'm stuck.

2016
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:08,980
I'm stuck.

2017
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,500
Hold on.

2018
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:13,940
Listen.

2019
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:14,940
This is me jumping.

2020
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,020
Grouch.

2021
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:25,530
We did it!

2022
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:26,450
Hahaha.

2023
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:31,770
I'm guessing this changes the direction of the conveyor belt?

2024
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,720
So now they're all going down.

2025
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,490
Now they're all going in.

2026
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,410
I'm just gonna save again.

2027
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,030
Oh my gosh, I only have one bullet left because I wasted it on that ugly...

2028
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:15,270
Uh-oh.

2029
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:15,910
Uh-oh.

2030
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:17,150
Uh-oh.

2031
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:17,310
Uh-oh.

2032
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,440
A gun with one bullet.

2033
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:30,250
Uh...

2034
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,740
Maybe I shouldn't just press it willy-nilly.

2035
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:36,460
Hahaha.

2036
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,380
Oh, go, go.

2037
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,680
Oh, not...oh.

2038
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:48,300
Ouch.

2039
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:50,920
Okay, okay, okay.

2040
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,260
Okay, okay, okay.

2041
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,000
Hahaha.

2042
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,780
This one only has five bullets.

2043
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,640
Oh, gosh.

2044
01:31:59,900 --> 01:31:59,980
Okay.

2045
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:04,790
What the?

2046
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:06,610
Oh.

2047
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:07,670
Go, go, go, go.

2048
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:11,050
Weeeee!

2049
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,700
What's over here?

2050
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:24,560
Ouch.

2051
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:25,960
Oh, really?

2052
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,260
Nothing?

2053
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,260
Wow, okay.

2054
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:27,900
Just kidding.

2055
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,580
Took damage for nothing.

2056
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:30,200
Hahaha.

2057
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,780
Hazardous machinery.

2058
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:35,440
Okay.

2059
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,660
Oh, oh.

2060
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:47,600
Oh, ow!

2061
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,550
Wait, I think that actually saved us some health.

2062
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:55,330
So nice.

2063
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:56,950
Okay.

2064
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:58,910
Yeah, who's going through this?

2065
01:32:59,410 --> 01:33:00,510
We're going through it.

2066
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:01,190
Clearly.

2067
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2068
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:08,010
Oh, we made it?

2069
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,850
Hahaha.

2070
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:17,980
Oh.

2071
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:19,200
Okay.

2072
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:19,340
Okay.

2073
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:20,580
Oh, more.

2074
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:21,000
Okay.

2075
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:22,000
Alright.

2076
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:31,920
Just once.

2077
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,480
Alright.

2078
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,800
One, two, three.

2079
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,780
Infectious waste.

2080
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,580
What's that mean?

2081
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,560
What?

2082
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,840
Wait, what does that mean?

2083
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:48,900
What's over here?

2084
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,480
Wait, oh, the infectious waste.

2085
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:50,740
Okay.

2086
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:51,780
Hahaha.

2087
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:52,700
Maybe.

2088
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:54,280
Okay, uh...

2089
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,280
Okay.

2090
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,940
Oh, oh, oh.

2091
01:33:59,060 --> 01:33:59,480
There we go.

2092
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,340
Very good.

2093
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,380
It's locked!

2094
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:07,220
Um...

2095
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:07,560
What's...

2096
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,200
That does nothing.

2097
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:09,640
Okay.

2098
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,660
Am I trapped here?

2099
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:10,940
No.

2100
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:11,640
Okay.

2101
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:12,920
Uh...

2102
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:13,360
Hehehe.

2103
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,020
Totally OSHA compliant workspace.

2104
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:17,820
Yes.

2105
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:20,900
Oh, golly.

2106
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:21,800
I can't see anything.

2107
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:22,480
Oh, gosh.

2108
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:22,740
Okay.

2109
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,180
Never mind.

2110
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,420
Let's just keep going along along.

2111
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:29,320
Keep it strong.

2112
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,520
Move along.

2113
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,540
Move along.

2114
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:55,920
Move along.

2115
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:56,440
Hold on.

2116
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,800
What is all this noise I'm hearing?

2117
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,460
Okay, not fine.

2118
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,090
Um...

2119
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:04,850
Stairs.

2120
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:06,350
Wait.

2121
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:08,070
Is this like a microwave hallway?

2122
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:09,130
Or...

2123
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:09,490
Hahaha.

2124
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:11,210
Um...

2125
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:12,110
Am I gonna get cooked?

2126
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,030
Yes.

2127
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:13,630
Chat!

2128
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:14,170
I'm cooked!

2129
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:15,150
Chat!

2130
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,130
I'm cooked!

2131
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:17,930
Hahaha.

2132
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:20,930
Don't get incinerated.

2133
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,070
No...

2134
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,800
Uh, wait.

2135
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:31,860
Um...

2136
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,740
Wait, which goes to the correct one?

2137
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:37,380
Oh!

2138
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,520
Not that!

2139
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,120
I just wasted my last bullet!

2140
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:44,380
Okay.

2141
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:45,720
Well...

2142
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,580
Um...

2143
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:50,780
What did I just...

2144
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:51,000
Oh.

2145
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,720
I think I got her...

2146
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:54,420
Oh.

2147
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:54,840
Ah!

2148
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:55,240
Oh!

2149
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,120
Sorry.

2150
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:56,940
I was trying to save.

2151
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:57,720
Manually.

2152
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,140
Let's go in there then!

2153
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,940
Cause it seems...

2154
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:02,080
Correct.

2155
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:05,620
Otherwise, they wouldn't have wanted me to shoot that, you know?

2156
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:05,860
Oh.

2157
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:06,640
Oh, shoot.

2158
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:07,980
Uh...

2159
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,380
I think it's a necessary.

2160
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,080
Oh my god.

2161
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:15,680
Oh my god.

2162
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,490
Mint is like revenge.

2163
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:23,830
Best served cooked.

2164
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:26,530
Ah!

2165
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,930
Game is on hard mode now!

2166
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,610
Anything that I can...

2167
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:05,370
Procure?

2168
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:06,170
Oh.

2169
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:09,430
No...

2170
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:10,570
Nothing!

2171
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,570
Who changed my settings?

2172
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,660
I hear fire...

2173
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,020
Wait, am I gonna have to get cooked again?

2174
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,940
Are these the stairs?

2175
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,380
Are there head...

2176
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,760
Are there crabs in here too?

2177
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,340
Probably.

2178
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,760
Oh my gosh.

2179
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,040
Oh my gosh.

2180
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,040
How am I supposed to kill you?

2181
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,280
Oh my gosh.

2182
01:37:58,330 --> 01:37:58,490
How am I supposed to kill you?

2183
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:58,910
Oh my gosh.

2184
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,260
With your fists.

2185
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:07,840
Sometimes my...

2186
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,660
My cursor...

2187
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:09,820
Or...

2188
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:10,280
Not my cursor.

2189
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:13,360
My mouse doesn't hold down when I'm trying to like...

2190
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:13,940
You know?

2191
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:16,540
So that's...

2192
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:17,760
If you're wondering why I'm like...

2193
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,120
Tap-tapping...

2194
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:19,200
It's because of that.

2195
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:22,420
Oh!

2196
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:22,960
We're here!

2197
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:23,320
Oh!

2198
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:24,840
I have to do it all over again!

2199
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:25,780
Are you kidding me?

2200
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:27,240
Oh!

2201
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,960
New mouse fund.

2202
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:32,200
Oh!

2203
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,020
I just bought this mouse recently.

2204
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,480
Go back?

2205
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:42,760
Wait, go back where?

2206
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:48,680
I have a ladder.

2207
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:49,300
I did it?

2208
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,570
This way?

2209
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:12,310
Was there a ladder here?

2210
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:13,430
Oh, I see it.

2211
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:14,110
Thank you, guys.

2212
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:20,020
I see, I see.

2213
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:27,800
This is giving me like... Astro Bot.

2214
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,320
Flashbacks.

2215
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:35,790
I'm guessing it doesn't matter which one I go to.

2216
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:43,330
Or maybe it did.

2217
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:43,990
Uh-oh.

2218
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:52,760
Holy...

2219
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,520
Oh, the other one would have been better, maybe.

2220
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:08,370
Oops.

2221
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:13,830
It's quite rude that they put me back here.

2222
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:16,790
Wait, uh... Crouch and go down.

2223
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:19,130
Okay.

2224
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,190
Okay.

2225
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:22,910
Slowly but surely.

2226
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:29,410
Okay.

2227
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:31,370
Let's try this.

2228
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:35,930
Maybe.

2229
01:40:42,130 --> 01:40:43,830
I also could like, go here.

2230
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:46,410
I guess I could have done that.

2231
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:47,730
But I'm not from that height.

2232
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:48,910
I don't think I would have made it.

2233
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,160
Yay!

2234
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,640
I made it!

2235
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,600
I made it!

2236
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:02,180
Oh...

2237
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,580
Those are some long, long tanks.

2238
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:06,840
Okay.

2239
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:17,280
It's really nice that they figure that you might be out of bullets at this point, so they don't like, put them in the middle, you know?

2240
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,400
The music.

2241
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,940
It's like, I don't think it's music, meant to be music, but it kind of sounds like music.

2242
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,000
Okay.

2243
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:39,570
Questionable ethics.

2244
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:47,990
Oh my god.

2245
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:50,810
Please.

2246
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:52,030
I'm gonna die here.

2247
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:55,510
Oh!

2248
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:01,960
What?

2249
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:08,620
Game is mean!

2250
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:09,240
Game is mean!

2251
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:18,390
Don't you have C4?

2252
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:19,790
Uh...

2253
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:19,990
Yes!

2254
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:22,670
But...

2255
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:24,850
I don't have any grenades!

2256
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:27,590
I have a crowbar and I have C4!

2257
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:30,370
That's it!

2258
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:46,180
Uh, how do I use the C4 again?

2259
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:49,260
Um...

2260
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,500
You can throw it.

2261
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,440
I can.

2262
01:42:58,620 --> 01:42:59,940
Left click throw.

2263
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:21,710
Hold on.

2264
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,070
I keep hearing...

2265
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:30,090
One of the sound effects sounds like the AOL, like, door opening sound.

2266
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:32,430
Oh, wow!

2267
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:33,150
They're all dead!

2268
01:43:34,850 --> 01:43:36,210
Wow-wee!

2269
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:37,330
Thank you, guys.

2270
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:40,010
I hear something else.

2271
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:41,970
I do hear something.

2272
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:45,450
Lookit there were dogs in their kennels.

2273
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:53,480
Hmm...

2274
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,960
Okay, good.

2275
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:56,660
Nice!

2276
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:56,820
Nice!

2277
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:10,070
Who's in there?

2278
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:13,390
I only have one left.

2279
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:26,220
Oh...

2280
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,100
What's going on?

2281
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,280
Oh!

2282
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:33,100
Oh!

2283
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:33,140
Oh!

2284
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:34,560
Don't come out.

2285
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:35,140
Don't...

2286
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:35,440
I...

2287
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,160
I'm safe.

2288
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:37,060
Probably.

2289
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:38,060
Hello.

2290
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:40,940
Oh!

2291
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:41,620
Ouch!

2292
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:42,540
What the hell?

2293
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,900
No, no, no.

2294
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,300
I'm sorry.

2295
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:46,560
What?

2296
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,060
What?

2297
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:50,780
He's in glass!

2298
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,040
Wait...

2299
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:07,720
Aw, dang it.

2300
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:27,030
Should I have done that?

2301
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,480
You had no choice?

2302
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:40,960
Oh, okay.

2303
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:41,000
Okay.

2304
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,700
What is this gonna do?

2305
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,260
Kill them all!

2306
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,840
Kill them!

2307
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,220
Kill the little headcrabs!

2308
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:50,820
Kill them!

2309
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,640
Oh!

2310
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:54,680
Nice!

2311
01:46:05,970 --> 01:46:06,610
Friendly fire?

2312
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:11,880
Uh...

2313
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,960
Is he coming for me?

2314
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,240
Ow!

2315
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:23,930
Please!

2316
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:25,790
Oh...

2317
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,380
The button.

2318
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:32,160
Oh...

2319
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,670
Maybe I should redo it.

2320
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:37,350
Okay, hold on.

2321
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,740
Okay, I know I'm far...

2322
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:43,500
I'm far from where we were, but...

2323
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,400
Now I'm prepared.

2324
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:45,780
Oh, I see!

2325
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:46,260
You're right!

2326
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:46,640
I...

2327
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,140
I had to do it, so that I could open the door.

2328
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:49,920
Okay, okay, okay.

2329
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:50,480
Okay.

2330
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:56,390
Listen now.

2331
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:59,610
Now we have...

2332
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:00,570
Less damage.

2333
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,190
Okay, okay, okay.

2334
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:08,150
We'll do this again.

2335
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:11,930
And then we'll lure him into the middle.

2336
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:13,390
And then we'll get him again!

2337
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,220
Bait him first, okay.

2338
01:47:24,970 --> 01:47:25,370
Nice.

2339
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:27,570
Okay, now open the door.

2340
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:31,050
But the other guy is gonna be there too.

2341
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:38,990
Send the bees!

2342
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:50,640
Will this get him?

2343
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,580
Will this get him?

2344
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,440
Oh, oh, oh!

2345
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,240
He's freaking out!

2346
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:05,660
Uh...

2347
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,200
Yeah!

2348
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:08,300
Yeah!

2349
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,240
I got a new gun.

2350
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:24,450
Uh...

2351
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:25,450
Don't really need that.

2352
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:28,510
Hey, it's no good up there.

2353
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:29,510
It's all sealed off.

2354
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:34,550
The only way out would be to find someone with scanner access who can open the front door.

2355
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:38,070
I'm pretty sure there's a few scientists hiding somewhere in the labs.

2356
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:41,950
Maybe with both of us looking, we can track them down and get them to let us out.

2357
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:42,810
Okay, Barney!

2358
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:42,890
Barney!

2359
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,490
I did almost shoot Barney.

2360
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,560
I 100% almost shot Barney.

2361
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:51,840
Okay.

2362
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,340
Split up, team!

2363
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:53,920
Actually...

2364
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,980
Yeah, we might stand a better chance if we team up.

2365
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

2366
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:56,660
Come here.

2367
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:56,940
Come on.

2368
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:57,640
Come with me.

2369
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:58,160
Come on.

2370
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:01,080
Stay behind me, Barney.

2371
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:02,220
Stay behind me.

2372
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:23,760
Um...

2373
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,220
Barney might be dead.

2374
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:37,870
Got him?

2375
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:39,050
Don't worry, Barney.

2376
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:40,630
Stay with me.

2377
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:43,050
Stay with me, Barney.

2378
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:49,870
Grabbing his guns.

2379
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:51,530
Oh, there's armor down there.

2380
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:52,210
Hold on, Barney.

2381
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,850
Barney.

2382
01:49:59,110 --> 01:49:59,610
Okay.

2383
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,190
Am I on the desk?

2384
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:02,290
Did I miss it?

2385
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:03,610
I must've.

2386
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:03,890
Oh!

2387
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:05,150
I see it?

2388
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:06,370
Wait, let me...

2389
01:50:06,370 --> 01:50:08,350
I don't know why I say it before not...

2390
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:09,210
grabbing that.

2391
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:09,610
Okay.

2392
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:10,410
Thank you!

2393
01:50:11,190 --> 01:50:11,690
Save.

2394
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:12,550
Alright, Barney.

2395
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:13,410
Barney.

2396
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:14,030
Barney, move.

2397
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:15,890
What's this say?

2398
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:19,950
Insider!

2399
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:23,550
In...

2400
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,310
Uh...

2401
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:24,750
Super...

2402
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:25,290
Bus...

2403
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:26,210
Via...

2404
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:28,850
Oh my god, he just ran in.

2405
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,010
Barney, Calhoun!

2406
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:31,710
Wait, no.

2407
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:32,330
What was that?

2408
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:33,610
Uh, Leeroy!

2409
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:34,790
That's what...

2410
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:35,990
That was his Leeroy moment.

2411
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:45,340
Wait, what's over here?

2412
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:55,000
This is a different room.

2413
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:57,360
Uh...

2414
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:57,780
Barney?

2415
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:58,660
Oh, okay.

2416
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:58,980
You're fine.

2417
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,060
Come in here.

2418
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,200
Come in here, Bar...

2419
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:07,540
No!

2420
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,500
Why did you do that?

2421
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,100
Why did he do that?

2422
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:24,290
Barney not...

2423
01:51:24,290 --> 01:51:24,570
Might...

2424
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:26,390
Might not be as...

2425
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:27,990
Uh...

2426
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:30,010
Wait, what is this?

2427
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:32,330
What the hell is this?

2428
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:34,610
He had no choice.

2429
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:35,210
Yes, he did!

2430
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:36,530
What is he fighting?

2431
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:37,650
What's...

2432
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:38,610
Who is he fighting out there?

2433
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:40,550
Oh, hold on.

2434
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:41,410
I wanna see what this does.

2435
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,160
Ah!

2436
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,000
It would've obliterated him.

2437
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,400
Snarks?

2438
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,220
That was the same thing.

2439
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:09,260
Wait, I hear more.

2440
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:10,020
Is Barney dead?

2441
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:14,600
Oh, he's not.

2442
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:17,900
Okay, why not?

2443
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:19,560
Didn't wanna die alone anyway.

2444
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:20,440
Ha!

2445
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:22,880
Idle with the snarks out for some fun interactions.

2446
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:25,940
Oh!

2447
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:27,980
It's kinda cute!

2448
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:30,000
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

2449
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:30,720
Ha, ha, ha!

2450
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:31,800
He

2451
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:38,670
was...

2452
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:40,270
Barney's kinda hardcore.

2453
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:41,270
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

2454
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:41,430
No!

2455
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,770
Did you kill...

2456
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:44,650
What'd you kill in here?

2457
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:44,890
Oh!

2458
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:46,250
Did you kill them?

2459
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,610
With just that?

2460
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:51,050
Barney?

2461
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:54,930
This Barney's the best Barney we could've had!

2462
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:57,550
1v2!

2463
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:01,900
Damn, Barney!

2464
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:08,570
Uh, is this a circle?

2465
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:10,570
Where are we?

2466
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:15,030
Yes.

2467
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:17,370
I just forgot to pick up that gun, apparently.

2468
01:53:17,610 --> 01:53:19,030
Barney is the go- Oh!

2469
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:20,210
Oh, wait!

2470
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:20,910
I didn't forget!

2471
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:22,250
Oh, I switched it out!

2472
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,290
Or, wait...

2473
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:27,800
That's...

2474
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,000
No.

2475
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:28,620
Huh?

2476
01:53:29,460 --> 01:53:30,180
That's weird.

2477
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:33,540
Oh, what'd that happen?

2478
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,800
Don't worry about it.

2479
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:40,120
Yeah.

2480
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:45,280
Um...

2481
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:45,960
Wait, hold on.

2482
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:46,900
Uh...

2483
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,320
I'm trying to figure out...

2484
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:50,620
Before we continue...

2485
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:52,340
Further this way...

2486
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,020
We went through here...

2487
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:56,440
Which was from where?

2488
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,250
Sorry, I'm just trying to make sure I...

2489
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,460
Remember what places we've gone to.

2490
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:00,720
Okay.

2491
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:02,140
So we went up...

2492
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,420
And then that lead...

2493
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,540
That's just a big circle.

2494
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:08,660
And so we haven't been down...

2495
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,280
Here.

2496
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,400
Ah, but I cannot.

2497
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:15,260
Okay, okay, okay.

2498
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:17,620
This game is...

2499
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:18,520
Pretty linear.

2500
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:20,800
And then this is the door he says that we need the scientists for.

2501
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:21,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2502
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:22,180
Okay.

2503
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:26,180
Under...

2504
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:26,540
Where?

2505
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,920
Yeah, we need a science man.

2506
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,220
For the scanner.

2507
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:34,920
Which we might find one in here?

2508
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:37,860
Barney?

2509
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:41,560
Be careful.

2510
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:48,600
Uh-oh, what did I do?

2511
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:49,240
Oh.

2512
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:52,380
Oh, there's two of them.

2513
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,740
Oh, there's two of them.

2514
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,100
Oh, there's two of them.

2515
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:08,380
Get Freeman!

2516
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,080
Uh, you have more...

2517
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,600
Important things to worry about, no?

2518
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:13,940
Use the snarks?

2519
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,540
I don't even know how to use them!

2520
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,220
What?

2521
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,980
I think the door blew Barney up.

2522
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,980
No, it didn't.

2523
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:41,060
Barney?

2524
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:43,680
The door crushed him!

2525
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,120
Stay...

2526
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:48,400
There.

2527
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:51,880
Stay there.

2528
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:52,880
Stay there.

2529
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,380
Yeah, I'll wait here.

2530
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:54,840
Yeah, yeah.

2531
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:56,240
It's exactly what I said.

2532
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:16,240
Does this do anything?

2533
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,040
No?

2534
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:17,380
Okay.

2535
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,240
Go up first, maybe?

2536
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,500
Yeah...

2537
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:28,140
I like how the way they're having us collect all of our ammo and stuff back.

2538
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:28,880
It's pretty fun.

2539
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,620
Okay, alright.

2540
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:33,420
Barney?

2541
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:34,940
He's still there.

2542
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,280
Okay.

2543
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,740
Wee-woo, wee-woo!

2544
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,560
Ah, the bees!

2545
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,260
Ow, the bees!

2546
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,000
Oh god, there's bees!

2547
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:50,600
Ah, the bees!

2548
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:51,480
Ah, the bees!

2549
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:55,480
I'm screwed.

2550
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:56,860
Uh, guys, I'm screwed.

2551
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:58,360
Oh god!

2552
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,220
Oh, the bees!

2553
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,280
Ah, the bees!

2554
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:06,620
Guys, I'm so screwed.

2555
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:08,160
Wait, did they kill Barney?

2556
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:20,670
I think our first plan was better.

2557
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:25,170
I think if I...

2558
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:25,530
Okay.

2559
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:27,110
I have to...

2560
01:57:27,110 --> 01:57:28,930
I have to wait for the...

2561
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:29,670
What's it called, guys?

2562
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:31,230
Throw more snarks?

2563
01:57:31,370 --> 01:57:32,570
But I only have five of them.

2564
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:34,350
I don't even know what it did.

2565
01:57:34,370 --> 01:57:35,090
What did it do?

2566
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:37,410
I...

2567
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:37,670
I...

2568
01:57:37,670 --> 01:57:40,110
You guys can't say use the snarks when I don't know what they do!

2569
01:57:40,330 --> 01:57:40,950
What it means!

2570
01:57:47,230 --> 01:57:49,930
Toss them and see I did, but I couldn't see what happened!

2571
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:52,550
Okay.

2572
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:53,310
Anyway.

2573
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:55,610
Uh...

2574
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:57,050
Uh, that was a bit chaos.

2575
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:59,050
So, I will...

2576
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:00,830
Um...

2577
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:02,230
Okay.

2578
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:03,950
I'm gonna...

2579
01:58:03,950 --> 01:58:05,750
Let the guys come in.

2580
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:06,870
Set up mines too.

2581
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:08,970
Oh, I guess I can grab them real quick.

2582
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:10,890
Yeah.

2583
01:58:12,530 --> 01:58:13,610
And, uh...

2584
01:58:13,610 --> 01:58:14,590
Set up my own.

2585
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:16,230
But I don't want them to blow up...

2586
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:18,630
Before I...

2587
01:58:19,530 --> 01:58:20,350
Okay, hold on.

2588
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:22,070
Um...

2589
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:23,330
I guess I can set one up here.

2590
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:26,010
Probably.

2591
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:27,730
Bring Barney upstairs?

2592
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:28,610
True.

2593
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:30,550
Barney, come here.

2594
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:32,270
Roger that.

2595
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:33,350
Let's run like hell.

2596
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:33,810
Yeah, yeah.

2597
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:34,190
Exactly.

2598
01:58:34,310 --> 01:58:34,810
Come here, come here, come here.

2599
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,870
Oh, I'm stuck.

2600
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:36,630
Come here, come here, come here.

2601
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:37,670
Come here, Barney.

2602
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:38,510
Barney?

2603
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:40,250
But don't get attacked by bees.

2604
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:41,350
Come here.

2605
01:58:41,670 --> 01:58:42,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2606
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:42,310
Okay.

2607
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:45,510
I'm scared.

2608
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:49,190
Shove them in a safe corner.

2609
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:51,370
Okay.

2610
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:53,550
We'll put one here, I think.

2611
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,280
He won't get bee'd if it's here.

2612
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,160
Too far.

2613
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:14,720
What do you mean?

2614
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:15,160
We'll see.

2615
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:20,440
Okay, be careful, Barney.

2616
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,980
Is it too high?

2617
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,260
He's running into action.

2618
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:38,210
Barney's insane.

2619
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:39,270
Barney did it!

2620
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,720
Good job, Barney.

2621
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:48,720
Barney.

2622
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,460
See, this one did work.

2623
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,700
It blew up.

2624
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:51,460
So it did...

2625
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:52,180
It did...

2626
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:53,320
Blow...

2627
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,040
Uh...

2628
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:55,340
Maybe...

2629
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:57,980
Oh, I think he touched it.

2630
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:58,700
And he wasn't...

2631
01:59:58,700 --> 01:59:59,720
Oh, I get it.

2632
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,720
Oh, I'm stupid.

2633
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:03,240
It was so far away, it didn't do anything.

2634
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,660
Barney the goal.

2635
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:07,780
Yeah, he is.

2636
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:09,440
Oops.

2637
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:12,560
Wait, I blew it up the star?

2638
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,040
I did?

2639
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:16,280
It blew up with the others.

2640
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:16,940
Oh.

2641
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:18,020
Wait, why?

2642
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:24,550
Welcome to membership.

2643
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:25,450
Thank you so much.

2644
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:26,090
Thank you.

2645
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:28,670
Why did it blow up when I shot the others?

2646
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:29,470
Chain reaction?

2647
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:30,150
Aw.

2648
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:31,470
Aw.

2649
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:32,890
Aw.

2650
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:33,150
Oh, well.

2651
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:35,250
I think we're good.

2652
02:00:36,710 --> 02:00:37,630
Hi, Barney.

2653
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:39,770
Okay, we might live longer if we work together.

2654
02:00:39,930 --> 02:00:40,250
Yep.

2655
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:42,070
Probably.

2656
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:44,310
Especially you.

2657
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:47,390
Don't touch those.

2658
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,670
Oh.

2659
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:50,450
Oh.

2660
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:50,730
Holy cow.

2661
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:00,540
Holy cow.

2662
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:05,940
I just took the...

2663
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:15,600
Yeah, let's go.

2664
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:16,480
Let's go.

2665
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,060
Alright.

2666
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:19,160
I'm prepared for this guy now.

2667
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,660
I'm prepared for him.

2668
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:23,820
Don't worry, Barney.

2669
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,260
Don't worry, Barney.

2670
02:01:37,870 --> 02:01:38,210
Oh.

2671
02:01:38,970 --> 02:01:39,650
Did you see that?

2672
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:41,930
Huh.

2673
02:01:44,410 --> 02:01:46,470
I only have one left though.

2674
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:49,690
I'll try using a snark.

2675
02:01:52,570 --> 02:01:53,530
Next time.

2676
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:54,930
We'll try using a snark.

2677
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:55,550
Okay, here we go.

2678
02:01:55,690 --> 02:01:56,410
He's so unimpressed.

2679
02:01:57,410 --> 02:01:59,330
He should be really impressed.

2680
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:02,490
You know...

2681
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:04,790
He should be like...

2682
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:06,850
Gosh.

2683
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:08,290
Scared me.

2684
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:10,430
Shotgun.

2685
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:11,770
I guess we could use that instead.

2686
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:31,280
Thanks, Barney.

2687
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:31,760
Ouch!

2688
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:32,400
You're hitting me!

2689
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:33,160
Friendly fire!

2690
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:43,320
Oh, come on.

2691
02:02:46,490 --> 02:02:47,030
Ouch!

2692
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:50,290
One hit wonder!

2693
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:51,670
Are you kidding me?

2694
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:52,330
Barney.

2695
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:53,350
Barney.

2696
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:54,650
Barney!

2697
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:57,110
Oh my god!

2698
02:02:58,570 --> 02:02:59,690
Oh my god!

2699
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:06,680
Maybe it's for the best.

2700
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,700
Sorry, Barney.

2701
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:10,840
I can't save you from a headcrab, buddy.

2702
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:11,900
I just...

2703
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:21,140
I can't go in there.

2704
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:23,200
Not that I really want to.

2705
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:23,980
What...

2706
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:25,440
For the purpose of this room anyway.

2707
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:29,120
Rip Barney.

2708
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:30,880
He was a real one, you guys.

2709
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,380
Rip Barney.

2710
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,620
I feel like I'm gonna get ambushed in here.

2711
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:40,360
Oh.

2712
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,700
What exploded?

2713
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:45,020
X.

2714
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:45,860
X.

2715
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:46,620
X.

2716
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:49,540
Almost dead.

2717
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:51,180
Did I?

2718
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:53,780
Oh, it was my...

2719
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:54,400
It was a trip...

2720
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:54,980
Oh, wait.

2721
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,320
There we go.

2722
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:57,680
Nice.

2723
02:03:59,260 --> 02:03:59,880
Okay!

2724
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:01,000
Alright.

2725
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,600
Barney was invented...

2726
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,200
Final destination rules!

2727
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:04,780
No!

2728
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:08,660
Oh!

2729
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,140
Okay, we're back here now.

2730
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:11,280
Okay, very nice.

2731
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:15,020
I'm sorry, buddy.

2732
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:21,400
What was that?

2733
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:28,800
Are you shooting at me?

2734
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:29,940
Or...

2735
02:04:37,310 --> 02:04:38,130
Oh my god.

2736
02:04:39,130 --> 02:04:39,990
Yes, you are.

2737
02:04:41,170 --> 02:04:41,310
Ah!

2738
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:42,970
Oh my god, please!

2739
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:43,390
Oh!

2740
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:50,490
I should've just let them...

2741
02:04:50,490 --> 02:04:51,190
Aim, Doko!

2742
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:52,990
Please, not today!

2743
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:17,120
I thought I heard someone else.

2744
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:23,370
Um...

2745
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:24,130
Still doing okay.

2746
02:05:24,470 --> 02:05:24,950
I suppose.

2747
02:05:25,530 --> 02:05:26,590
What's this button do?

2748
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:37,120
What is this thing?

2749
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:38,220
Some kind of weapon?

2750
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:39,200
Put that down.

2751
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,400
It's a prototype.

2752
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:41,200
Wait!

2753
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:43,320
They're doing a cutscene that I can't even see!

2754
02:05:47,020 --> 02:05:47,480
Wait!

2755
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:47,900
Hold on!

2756
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:50,660
Oh my god.

2757
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:51,320
Oh my god.

2758
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:52,300
He takes so...

2759
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:52,860
They take...

2760
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:54,060
They eat so much damage.

2761
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:01,480
What?

2762
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:02,960
Where's the cutscene?

2763
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:05,340
This?

2764
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:05,900
No!

2765
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:07,040
Where is the cutscene?

2766
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:08,860
You missed the scene!

2767
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:09,320
Hold on.

2768
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:10,040
I'm gonna reload.

2769
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,420
Where...

2770
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:11,900
Where...

2771
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,620
I don't know where it happens.

2772
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,240
Oh!

2773
02:06:17,740 --> 02:06:18,260
Ah!

2774
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:21,120
I got him.

2775
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,660
Oh, just in the hallway?

2776
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:25,480
Oh, wait.

2777
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:33,410
Come back!

2778
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:39,700
Doesn't have cutscenes.

2779
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:40,940
You know what I meant.

2780
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:44,640
Oh.

2781
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:47,920
Thank you.

2782
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:50,780
Okay.

2783
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:52,320
Anyway, those guys are taken care of.

2784
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:52,900
Now...

2785
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,620
Now we can listen.

2786
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:58,520
Like, where are the people at?

2787
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:58,580
What do you think?

2788
02:06:58,840 --> 02:06:59,860
Is it some kind of weapon?

2789
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:00,820
Put that down.

2790
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,080
It's a prototype.

2791
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:03,620
Oh!

2792
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,580
Well, isn't it?

2793
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:07,680
It's much too unpredictable.

2794
02:07:08,140 --> 02:07:09,060
Don't let it overcharge.

2795
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:09,680
Wait, what do you mean?

2796
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:10,380
Overcharge.

2797
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:26,980
Fancy.

2798
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:28,580
You let it overcharge.

2799
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:31,180
So if I also let it overcharge...

2800
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:34,340
Am I in trouble?

2801
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:38,080
The BFG of the game.

2802
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,000
Wait, does it work like the BFG even?

2803
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:43,660
Save and try.

2804
02:07:55,090 --> 02:07:55,950
Like that.

2805
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:03,080
The music all of a sudden.

2806
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:13,510
Do not obstruct laser shield.

2807
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:14,340
Okay.

2808
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:16,280
I haven't been.

2809
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:19,980
Oh, okay.

2810
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:20,500
This one's on.

2811
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:23,600
Or as it should be, I suppose.

2812
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:25,180
How many are there?

2813
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:30,220
Hmm.

2814
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:39,300
Holy cow.

2815
02:08:41,880 --> 02:08:42,500
Whoa.

2816
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:46,120
One hit.

2817
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:48,720
It's so stinking strong.

2818
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:50,500
Oh.

2819
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:52,840
Okay.

2820
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:57,920
But I probably should not use it.

2821
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:00,700
For, you know, willy-nilly-ness.

2822
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:02,640
Let's use it.

2823
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:03,300
Let's get this.

2824
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:03,580
Yeah.

2825
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,400
Only 12 ammo.

2826
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:05,420
Yeah.

2827
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,400
Use it in panic.

2828
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:07,080
But that's okay.

2829
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:09,340
We'll maybe get more.

2830
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:10,060
Who knows?

2831
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:11,340
Maybe.

2832
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:11,900
Who knows?

2833
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:17,800
I wish you'd give me more shield, please.

2834
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:19,660
Save it for big boys.

2835
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:20,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2836
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:21,720
I'll save it for the big boys.

2837
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,200
Oh, what's this?

2838
02:09:23,900 --> 02:09:25,460
Is that ammo for it?

2839
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:25,960
Oh.

2840
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:26,960
Okay.

2841
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:28,200
Yellow is the ammo.

2842
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:28,680
There we go.

2843
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:32,300
Very nice.

2844
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:39,630
Okay.

2845
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:40,470
We got over here.

2846
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:43,930
Whoa.

2847
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:46,150
Whoa.

2848
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:48,630
Okay.

2849
02:09:49,570 --> 02:09:50,210
Cool.

2850
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:52,330
One more to go.

2851
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:52,910
Okay.

2852
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:04,600
Wait.

2853
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:05,860
How much?

2854
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:06,160
Okay.

2855
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:07,100
I still only have one.

2856
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:07,700
That sucks.

2857
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:08,640
Okay.

2858
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:09,500
Save.

2859
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,320
Oh.

2860
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:13,960
Oh.

2861
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:14,620
What?

2862
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:15,560
Oh.

2863
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,260
Uh.

2864
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:16,980
Just kidding.

2865
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:17,580
Um.

2866
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:21,420
The...

2867
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,200
Oh, the yellow button.

2868
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:23,120
The one that...

2869
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:23,560
Oh, okay.

2870
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:25,820
This one.

2871
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,580
Oh, it didn't do anything.

2872
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:40,600
Oh.

2873
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:49,820
Please watch Half-Life VR, but the AI is self-aware.

2874
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:56,310
You were saying?

2875
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:57,630
Yeah.

2876
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:06,840
Wait.

2877
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:07,580
Is it timed?

2878
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:08,480
Or...

2879
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:10,420
Did it do all that it needed to do?

2880
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:10,960
Okay.

2881
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:11,760
Maybe it's timed.

2882
02:11:13,860 --> 02:11:14,200
Uh...

2883
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,460
Where at?

2884
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:21,900
Uh...

2885
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,640
What does the sign say?

2886
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:27,760
The do not obstruct laser shield?

2887
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:30,800
The thing...

2888
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:31,300
Oh, wait.

2889
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:36,690
Wait.

2890
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:37,050
Uh...

2891
02:11:37,050 --> 02:11:37,230
Wait.

2892
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:38,470
Can I...

2893
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:39,390
Come on.

2894
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:41,050
Come on.

2895
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:45,030
Um...

2896
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:47,890
Uh...

2897
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:50,470
I didn't collect all the ammo?

2898
02:11:50,630 --> 02:11:50,890
I didn't?

2899
02:11:52,050 --> 02:11:52,830
Where at?

2900
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:54,050
Oh, wait.

2901
02:11:54,130 --> 02:11:54,230
Here?

2902
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:55,290
There we go.

2903
02:11:55,710 --> 02:11:55,990
Thank you.

2904
02:11:57,790 --> 02:11:59,510
Was there any in here as well?

2905
02:11:59,630 --> 02:12:00,390
Let me double check.

2906
02:12:02,010 --> 02:12:02,690
No...

2907
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:03,850
Laser.

2908
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:08,390
Is there another box we can...

2909
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:09,610
Use...

2910
02:12:09,610 --> 02:12:10,250
Somehow?

2911
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:20,050
Obstruct the shield.

2912
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:20,610
I will!

2913
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,290
Give me a second.

2914
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:22,610
Give me...

2915
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:23,170
One second.

2916
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:26,810
One...

2917
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:28,050
Luzon.

2918
02:12:28,150 --> 02:12:28,810
Welcome back.

2919
02:12:28,930 --> 02:12:29,770
Thank you for two of us.

2920
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:30,690
Thank you so much.

2921
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:32,050
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2922
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:32,910
Oh, wrong one.

2923
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:33,190
Okay.

2924
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:37,430
I had it?

2925
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:37,770
I did?

2926
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:42,810
The shield itself.

2927
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:44,370
Oh, like so...

2928
02:12:44,370 --> 02:12:44,750
Oh!

2929
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:46,390
Oh, we need to make it...

2930
02:12:46,390 --> 02:12:47,610
So that it doesn't go down.

2931
02:12:47,610 --> 02:12:48,770
So the laser...

2932
02:12:49,210 --> 02:12:49,570
Will...

2933
02:12:49,570 --> 02:12:50,530
Bust through the wall.

2934
02:12:50,910 --> 02:12:51,670
I got it.

2935
02:12:57,780 --> 02:12:58,540
Look at it.

2936
02:12:58,620 --> 02:12:59,740
It's not even that strong.

2937
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:05,760
Took so long to get through this teeny wall.

2938
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:07,200
Is it gonna...

2939
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:09,740
Can we break the ceiling too?

2940
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:16,260
Say that again after you touch it.

2941
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:16,720
That...

2942
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:18,080
It still took two...

2943
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:18,640
Like a...

2944
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:19,560
Two seconds...

2945
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:20,120
To...

2946
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:20,760
To get me.

2947
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:21,840
Woo!

2948
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:22,160
Woo!

2949
02:13:24,720 --> 02:13:25,520
Parkour down.

2950
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,420
Aim for the boxes.

2951
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:26,840
Wait.

2952
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:27,980
Uh...

2953
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:28,340
Hold on.

2954
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,660
I'm gonna go for the...

2955
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:31,700
Here?

2956
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:32,420
Okay.

2957
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:32,820
Okay.

2958
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:34,780
Uh...

2959
02:13:34,780 --> 02:13:35,540
What else can I...

2960
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:36,400
Oh, land on this.

2961
02:13:37,300 --> 02:13:38,000
There we go.

2962
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:39,440
And then this.

2963
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:41,320
Ouch!

2964
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:42,360
I still took damage!

2965
02:13:42,860 --> 02:13:44,020
I did my best.

2966
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:54,540
Minus two.

2967
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:57,640
She's a trained professional.

2968
02:13:58,300 --> 02:13:58,940
Yeah, exactly.

2969
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:01,460
Mito doesn't need to hear this.

2970
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:07,510
Scientist.

2971
02:14:07,630 --> 02:14:08,090
Scientist.

2972
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:09,190
Thank God.

2973
02:14:09,690 --> 02:14:13,590
Get us out of here before those military drones figure out where we're hiding.

2974
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:16,010
We all have regional scanner access.

2975
02:14:16,330 --> 02:14:19,250
Escort us to the lobby and we can get out of the lab.

2976
02:14:19,710 --> 02:14:20,010
Okay.

2977
02:14:20,230 --> 02:14:21,250
Oh, there's three of you.

2978
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:31,170
Okay.

2979
02:14:31,790 --> 02:14:32,650
Uh...

2980
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:35,590
Why do you have this?

2981
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:37,910
Oh...

2982
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:38,910
Classic Peter.

2983
02:14:39,230 --> 02:14:40,250
That guy Peter.

2984
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:51,250
Okay, you're safe.

2985
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:00,070
Uh, watch out.

2986
02:15:00,410 --> 02:15:01,610
Don't touch that part, okay?

2987
02:15:04,250 --> 02:15:05,150
You first.

2988
02:15:05,770 --> 02:15:06,410
Go.

2989
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:08,250
Go.

2990
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:13,660
Open it.

2991
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:14,640
Oh.

2992
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:15,960
Sorry.

2993
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:16,960
Anyway.

2994
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:19,080
Where's our other guy at?

2995
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:22,140
Weren't there... What do you mean?

2996
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:23,680
There's three of you.

2997
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:24,020
Come on.

2998
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:25,660
Beep, beep.

2999
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:26,920
Did I save?

3000
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:27,340
Okay.

3001
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,240
Come on.

3002
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:32,820
We got one guy.

3003
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,520
He's the realest one here.

3004
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:37,500
Come on.

3005
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:39,520
Come on.

3006
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:42,710
Let's keep going.

3007
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:44,290
Need to call him again.

3008
02:15:44,470 --> 02:15:45,650
Maybe we'll do one at a time.

3009
02:15:45,650 --> 02:15:46,270
I don't know.

3010
02:15:46,270 --> 02:15:46,270
Whoa.

3011
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:54,630
He's stomping along.

3012
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:55,370
Oh.

3013
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:56,970
He'll run if I do?

3014
02:15:57,170 --> 02:15:57,290
Okay.

3015
02:15:58,010 --> 02:15:58,650
Come on, buddy.

3016
02:16:06,690 --> 02:16:08,090
We only need the one guy, no?

3017
02:16:08,570 --> 02:16:09,230
Open it up.

3018
02:16:11,630 --> 02:16:12,150
Use it.

3019
02:16:12,370 --> 02:16:12,490
Oh.

3020
02:16:12,690 --> 02:16:12,970
Good job.

3021
02:16:15,970 --> 02:16:17,470
Well, I'll let you know.

3022
02:16:17,690 --> 02:16:18,590
But I'm warning you.

3023
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:19,670
It's hell out there.

3024
02:16:19,870 --> 02:16:21,930
It's completely under military control.

3025
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:24,930
You'll have to sneak and fight your way from one end to the other.

3026
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:28,290
And I don't expect you'll meet many of our peers along the way.

3027
02:16:28,450 --> 02:16:33,590
But if you do survive and somehow make it across the base, you'll end up at the Lambda Complex.

3028
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:34,030
Oh.

3029
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:35,950
Where the rest of the science team has taken shelter.

3030
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:37,570
I wouldn't venture there myself.

3031
02:16:37,850 --> 02:16:39,810
But I will let them know that you are coming.

3032
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:40,950
Oh, thanks.

3033
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:41,210
Bye.

3034
02:16:41,210 --> 02:16:41,230
Bye.

3035
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:49,070
Here we go.

3036
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:51,690
We have to sneak and...

3037
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:54,270
Sneak and fight.

3038
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:55,390
Why did he leave?

3039
02:16:56,150 --> 02:16:57,150
I don't... I don't know.

3040
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:06,080
Oh.

3041
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:08,460
It's a bad guy, right?

3042
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:19,110
Yeah.

3043
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:21,350
Okay.

3044
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:23,750
Is there another guy?

3045
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:25,470
Oh.

3046
02:17:25,950 --> 02:17:26,550
Woo!

3047
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:42,260
Let's see.

3048
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:49,660
Oops.

3049
02:17:54,270 --> 02:17:54,810
Oh.

3050
02:18:02,300 --> 02:18:02,840
Gordon.

3051
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:07,160
Can you hold it for a longer throw?

3052
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:08,400
I don't...

3053
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:10,660
Right, you can't pick them up.

3054
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:12,080
You can't pick them up, you guys.

3055
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:16,240
We tried before in the past.

3056
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:26,700
Right-click to pick up.

3057
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:27,880
No, it doesn't work.

3058
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:30,000
It's only in online mode, apparently.

3059
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:33,640
Oh.

3060
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:34,540
Shoot.

3061
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:39,060
Try my new gun.

3062
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:39,480
Hey!

3063
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:41,420
Try the new gun.

3064
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:42,260
Let's try the new gun.

3065
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:46,100
Nice.

3066
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:52,800
Oh, the scientists.

3067
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:53,380
What?

3068
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:55,000
They said they were taking shelter.

3069
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:57,460
But they're not taking shelter at all.

3070
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,160
So sad.

3071
02:18:59,480 --> 02:18:59,980
So sad.

3072
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:02,300
Okay.

3073
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:06,340
If I just...

3074
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:08,340
Wait, am I...

3075
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,360
There we go.

3076
02:19:14,170 --> 02:19:15,070
Take you too.

3077
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:19,130
This is so sad.

3078
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:22,290
I'm just going to save.

3079
02:19:22,470 --> 02:19:22,750
It's fine.

3080
02:19:22,970 --> 02:19:23,410
We're fine.

3081
02:19:23,590 --> 02:19:24,230
Everything's fine.

3082
02:19:24,690 --> 02:19:25,170
Everything's...

3083
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:26,030
Everything's a-okay.

3084
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:27,410
Even though I...

3085
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:28,470
Wasted...

3086
02:19:30,930 --> 02:19:32,050
Everything's not okay.

3087
02:19:32,930 --> 02:19:33,970
Everything's not okay.

3088
02:19:34,110 --> 02:19:35,110
Where did that come from?

3089
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:39,980
Explode it for fun.

3090
02:19:49,070 --> 02:19:49,950
I can't...

3091
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:50,050
Oh.

3092
02:19:50,250 --> 02:19:51,050
Oh, with...

3093
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:52,450
This, obviously.

3094
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:54,490
No.

3095
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:55,490
No, no.

3096
02:19:56,530 --> 02:19:56,970
No.

3097
02:19:57,210 --> 02:19:59,650
I am not going to take damage from my own C4.

3098
02:20:00,430 --> 02:20:01,130
No, no.

3099
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:03,850
No, no, no, no.

3100
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:06,690
Okay.

3101
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:07,290
This thing.

3102
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:19,760
There we go.

3103
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:20,140
Okay.

3104
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:28,460
There we go.

3105
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:32,360
Now we can continue onwards.

3106
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:34,740
Now we can continue...

3107
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:36,280
Oh, let me reload and then save again.

3108
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:36,600
Okay.

3109
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:47,280
I'm more afraid of the military men than I am of the monsters.

3110
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,040
I'm not going to lie.

3111
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:52,600
I'm way more afraid of the military men than I am of the monsters.

3112
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:57,680
Oh.

3113
02:20:58,040 --> 02:20:58,500
I need...

3114
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:12,820
Oh.

3115
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:26,220
I did not see that.

3116
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:29,960
Scones.

3117
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,680
Pretty good.

3118
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:39,620
Right in the face.

3119
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:40,280
I know.

3120
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:41,980
That was pretty bad, wasn't it?

3121
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:42,920
Oh.

3122
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:47,720
I'm going to restart.

3123
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:50,080
Oh.

3124
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:50,340
Hold on.

3125
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:52,480
Let's just...

3126
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:54,700
Let's just redo that part.

3127
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:55,880
Right, quick.

3128
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:04,420
Where are they?

3129
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:11,340
Snark time?

3130
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:11,840
Oh, yeah.

3131
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:12,600
Let me try it.

3132
02:22:13,300 --> 02:22:14,180
What do I just...

3133
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,400
Do I just...

3134
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:16,060
Throw him?

3135
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:42,630
Is there a guy back there?

3136
02:22:43,330 --> 02:22:43,610
Yeah.

3137
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:46,570
Can I...

3138
02:22:46,570 --> 02:22:46,830
Can I...

3139
02:22:53,710 --> 02:22:55,050
It was worth.

3140
02:22:56,970 --> 02:22:57,710
Oh, wait.

3141
02:22:57,770 --> 02:22:58,570
I got five more.

3142
02:22:58,810 --> 02:22:59,150
Perfect.

3143
02:22:59,430 --> 02:22:59,770
Never mind.

3144
02:23:00,190 --> 02:23:00,430
Wow.

3145
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:01,570
The snark was so funny.

3146
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:03,050
I liked him.

3147
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:06,490
That was cute.

3148
02:23:06,890 --> 02:23:07,530
That was pretty funny.

3149
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:10,150
I like that guy.

3150
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:11,570
Somebody's gone now.

3151
02:23:12,830 --> 02:23:13,430
Oh, nice.

3152
02:23:13,570 --> 02:23:13,890
Nice, nice, nice.

3153
02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:14,350
Take it.

3154
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:14,710
I'll take it.

3155
02:23:14,770 --> 02:23:15,150
I'll take it.

3156
02:23:15,650 --> 02:23:16,190
I'll take it.

3157
02:23:16,250 --> 02:23:16,530
I'll take it.

3158
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:16,830
Oh.

3159
02:23:17,210 --> 02:23:17,470
Wow.

3160
02:23:17,550 --> 02:23:18,170
There's so many.

3161
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:20,330
Generous.

3162
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:22,350
Snark is a lot of fun.

3163
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:24,290
I...

3164
02:23:25,810 --> 02:23:26,450
Fuel storage.

3165
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:26,970
Let's see.

3166
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:27,410
Oh, wait.

3167
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:29,410
I don't think it will let me pick up this gun.

3168
02:23:29,570 --> 02:23:30,130
Or this one.

3169
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:30,330
Okay.

3170
02:23:30,910 --> 02:23:32,210
They blow up eventually.

3171
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:32,850
Oh.

3172
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:38,470
I like kind of defending myself with the grenade.

3173
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:39,150
You know what I mean?

3174
02:23:40,030 --> 02:23:40,370
Okay.

3175
02:23:40,830 --> 02:23:41,510
Let's sneak.

3176
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:42,270
We're sneaking.

3177
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:43,850
We're not sneaking.

3178
02:23:44,170 --> 02:23:44,570
Just kidding.

3179
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:45,450
We're...

3180
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:46,470
We're...

3181
02:23:46,470 --> 02:23:47,130
Uh...

3182
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:48,050
Running.

3183
02:23:48,250 --> 02:23:48,590
We're running.

3184
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:49,270
We're running.

3185
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:49,870
We're running.

3186
02:23:59,270 --> 02:24:00,990
Will this work on it?

3187
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:06,250
I think I missed it.

3188
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:09,830
I think I missed.

3189
02:24:21,460 --> 02:24:22,200
Was that enough?

3190
02:24:22,900 --> 02:24:23,280
Oh,

3191
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:30,470
uh-oh.

3192
02:24:30,630 --> 02:24:30,730
Wait.

3193
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:31,290
Wait, wait, wait.

3194
02:24:31,950 --> 02:24:32,710
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3195
02:24:34,090 --> 02:24:34,790
Wait, wait, wait.

3196
02:24:34,970 --> 02:24:36,010
It's gonna blow up on me.

3197
02:24:38,810 --> 02:24:39,190
Oh.

3198
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:40,330
No.

3199
02:24:40,970 --> 02:24:41,830
I messed up.

3200
02:24:42,490 --> 02:24:42,870
Dang it.

3201
02:24:43,070 --> 02:24:43,630
I messed up.

3202
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:52,220
I used up all my ammo.

3203
02:24:56,900 --> 02:24:58,020
Maybe it was worth it, though.

3204
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,140
For that kind of boss, you know?

3205
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:02,040
Or not a boss, but you know what I mean.

3206
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,320
Worth it?

3207
02:25:09,090 --> 02:25:09,810
Okay, hold on.

3208
02:25:11,550 --> 02:25:12,190
Is there...

3209
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:13,310
I will...

3210
02:25:13,310 --> 02:25:14,150
I will save it.

3211
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:15,050
I will save the game.

3212
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:16,270
But I'm gonna make a new save just in case.

3213
02:25:18,190 --> 02:25:18,790
Um...

3214
02:25:20,570 --> 02:25:21,910
Oh, it's one of these.

3215
02:25:25,130 --> 02:25:26,410
Down the hole.

3216
02:25:32,450 --> 02:25:34,450
I don't think I can snipe it.

3217
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:35,330
With that...

3218
02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:36,230
I don't think that worked.

3219
02:25:38,010 --> 02:25:39,570
Right down the barrel.

3220
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:44,460
Okay, hold on.

3221
02:25:44,460 --> 02:25:44,820
All right.

3222
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:45,580
I did save.

3223
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:47,140
So, we could just run for it.

3224
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:51,560
And zigzag.

3225
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:52,660
Zigzag.

3226
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:53,400
Zigzag.

3227
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:53,860
Okay.

3228
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:56,100
Never mind.

3229
02:25:56,660 --> 02:25:57,340
Oh, okay.

3230
02:25:57,440 --> 02:25:59,380
It's a good thing we took out the chopper then, actually.

3231
02:25:59,540 --> 02:25:59,980
Never mind.

3232
02:26:00,380 --> 02:26:00,500
Oh.

3233
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:02,760
Oh.

3234
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:03,880
Oh.

3235
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:13,850
Long-range grenade launcher?

3236
02:26:14,270 --> 02:26:14,750
I...

3237
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:15,270
Um...

3238
02:26:15,270 --> 02:26:16,070
Don't have that.

3239
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:25,090
Can we go into the water?

3240
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:30,540
Oops.

3241
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:36,040
Might as well restore health.

3242
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,580
Wait, where?

3243
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:38,280
Oh, with these.

3244
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:39,160
So true.

3245
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:40,040
You're so right.

3246
02:26:41,620 --> 02:26:44,600
I was like, There's so many here, and I completely forgot about them.

3247
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:45,980
Okay.

3248
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:47,120
Good thinking.

3249
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:47,920
Good job, guys.

3250
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:49,180
Good thinking, guys.

3251
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,560
There's a friend in the water?

3252
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:53,080
Wait, I want to see a friend.

3253
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:54,160
Let's go check him out.

3254
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:00,140
Oh!

3255
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:01,000
He's dead!

3256
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:11,640
Let's see.

3257
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:14,460
Uh...

3258
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:17,280
I don't think I can make that.

3259
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:21,000
The helicopter got him!

3260
02:27:21,060 --> 02:27:21,380
Oh, wait.

3261
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:21,800
Hold on.

3262
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:23,300
Oh, that's so funny.

3263
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:28,060
I just turned off something.

3264
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:33,880
Um...

3265
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:40,060
Is that...

3266
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:41,320
Can I get him from here?

3267
02:27:45,320 --> 02:27:46,680
I don't think it worked.

3268
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:49,440
Oh...

3269
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:50,520
Oh!

3270
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:56,280
Is there anything down here?

3271
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:58,760
Oh, wait.

3272
02:27:58,900 --> 02:27:59,460
There's a...

3273
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:00,380
There's a little lever.

3274
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:03,780
Hold on.

3275
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:05,720
This?

3276
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:07,580
Wait.

3277
02:28:11,240 --> 02:28:12,240
What opens?

3278
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:17,880
Oh, oh.

3279
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:19,980
Oh, oh.

3280
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:27,960
Oh, no, scientist.

3281
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:29,980
Thank you.

3282
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:31,460
I'll take that.

3283
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:32,400
Definitely need that.

3284
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:33,980
Okay.

3285
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:37,040
Cool.

3286
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:38,560
Let's keep going.

3287
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:43,480
Let's hope for no friends in the water.

3288
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,880
Can I bust this open?

3289
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:01,680
Okay.

3290
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:04,660
Okay.

3291
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:06,740
Which way shall we go?

3292
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:09,040
Guys, left or right?

3293
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:09,660
Left or right?

3294
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:09,740
Yeah.

3295
02:29:11,220 --> 02:29:13,040
Any, many, many, mo.

3296
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,220
Catch a tiger by his toe.

3297
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,480
If he hollers, let him go.

3298
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:21,860
My mom said to pick the very best one.

3299
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:23,620
And you are it.

3300
02:29:24,180 --> 02:29:24,820
To the left.

3301
02:29:25,360 --> 02:29:26,440
Take it back now, y'all.

3302
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:34,930
Technically, the left was better.

3303
02:29:35,290 --> 02:29:36,230
Because it was close.

3304
02:29:37,610 --> 02:29:38,390
Oh, no.

3305
02:29:38,670 --> 02:29:39,470
It was closer.

3306
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:40,230
No!

3307
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:43,250
Oh, no.

3308
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:46,450
Oh, no.

3309
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:48,810
I have no more ammo.

3310
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:52,450
What's it fighting?

3311
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:10,240
Oh, it gave me ammo for it.

3312
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:13,920
Wait.

3313
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:14,500
Okay.

3314
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:15,040
I'm in.

3315
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:16,580
It gave me ammo for it.

3316
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:17,840
Okay.

3317
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:21,180
Only 20, but it was better than nothing, I suppose.

3318
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:24,880
I'm sorry?

3319
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:26,560
Where the hell did you come from?

3320
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:29,160
Ah!

3321
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:43,580
Oh, my God.

3322
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:44,420
Oh, my God.

3323
02:30:50,390 --> 02:30:51,970
We came to board.

3324
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:54,330
All right.

3325
02:30:54,330 --> 02:30:56,210
What I'm going to do is...

3326
02:30:58,890 --> 02:30:59,330
Okay.

3327
02:31:00,510 --> 02:31:00,950
Let's...

3328
02:31:00,950 --> 02:31:03,670
Let's get an idea of what's going on here, you know?

3329
02:31:04,310 --> 02:31:05,170
I'm going to climb.

3330
02:31:07,730 --> 02:31:08,170
Okay.

3331
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:09,110
There's stuff over here.

3332
02:31:09,950 --> 02:31:10,750
That's exciting.

3333
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:14,890
He doesn't see me, does he?

3334
02:31:14,970 --> 02:31:15,990
I'm a cactus.

3335
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:18,530
He doesn't see me, will he?

3336
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:19,550
Oh.

3337
02:31:19,810 --> 02:31:20,270
Oh, oh.

3338
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:21,450
Oh, oh.

3339
02:31:21,850 --> 02:31:22,690
Oh, oh, oh.

3340
02:31:22,830 --> 02:31:23,190
Oh, oh.

3341
02:31:23,190 --> 02:31:23,210
Oh, oh.

3342
02:31:25,370 --> 02:31:25,810
Oh!

3343
02:31:26,970 --> 02:31:27,410
Okay!

3344
02:31:28,270 --> 02:31:28,650
Oh!

3345
02:31:30,230 --> 02:31:30,670
Um...

3346
02:31:30,670 --> 02:31:31,070
Hold on.

3347
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:32,050
Let's redo that.

3348
02:31:33,210 --> 02:31:34,430
Oh, I forgot about you.

3349
02:31:35,890 --> 02:31:36,330
Okay.

3350
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:36,850
Just kidding.

3351
02:31:41,490 --> 02:31:42,770
Okay, save.

3352
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:46,690
And... when he's gone.

3353
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:48,870
When he's gone.

3354
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:50,610
When he's gone.

3355
02:31:51,610 --> 02:31:53,890
We're gonna run when he's gone.

3356
02:31:54,450 --> 02:31:55,430
And then we're gonna run back.

3357
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:03,940
We're gonna keep going.

3358
02:32:04,520 --> 02:32:04,920
Okay.

3359
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:06,280
Alright, nice.

3360
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:07,420
Okay.

3361
02:32:08,340 --> 02:32:09,460
We're gonna hide.

3362
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:20,360
Oh.

3363
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,540
We're gonna get a better gun.

3364
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:29,860
Caution, high voltage.

3365
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:31,360
Okay.

3366
02:32:40,100 --> 02:32:41,340
We're sneaky.

3367
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:44,360
We're not sneaky.

3368
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,520
Ha ha ha ha.

3369
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:47,980
It's fine.

3370
02:32:48,060 --> 02:32:48,580
I just saved.

3371
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:50,380
Let's just see what's going on around here.

3372
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:52,940
Oh, there's a little... there's a little hidey hole.

3373
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:54,420
Oh, awesome.

3374
02:32:55,700 --> 02:32:57,460
Storm drain hatch.

3375
02:32:57,780 --> 02:32:58,240
Okay.

3376
02:32:58,820 --> 02:32:59,380
Perfect.

3377
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:01,140
Sneaky.

3378
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:04,120
Storm... storm drain hatch.

3379
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:08,280
Where?

3380
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:09,100
Where?

3381
02:33:09,620 --> 02:33:09,620
Where?

3382
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,920
I can... two can play at that game.

3383
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:33,480
Oh.

3384
02:33:34,420 --> 02:33:34,420
Oh.

3385
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:34,640
Oh.

3386
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:35,560
Yeah.

3387
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:36,120
Okay.

3388
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:37,340
Awesome.

3389
02:33:38,660 --> 02:33:39,320
Not awesome.

3390
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:40,000
Not awesome.

3391
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:40,900
Not awesome.

3392
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:44,440
Scout!

3393
02:33:48,220 --> 02:33:48,640
Okay.

3394
02:33:48,660 --> 02:33:49,240
I'm just gonna save.

3395
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:50,280
Ha ha ha ha.

3396
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:51,440
And we're gonna run around.

3397
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:53,220
Where was that guy anyway?

3398
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:54,480
Where was that guy camping?

3399
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:55,080
I don't know.

3400
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:57,560
Woo!

3401
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:57,980
Woo!

3402
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:09,570
Scouts.

3403
02:34:11,470 --> 02:34:13,690
I don't... how do... how do we get over here?

3404
02:34:16,670 --> 02:34:17,090
Oh.

3405
02:34:17,250 --> 02:34:17,490
Never mind.

3406
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:17,730
Sorry.

3407
02:34:17,950 --> 02:34:19,470
I did not realize this was the...

3408
02:34:20,090 --> 02:34:21,030
What is the tower?

3409
02:34:21,230 --> 02:34:21,350
Oh.

3410
02:34:21,570 --> 02:34:22,690
I'm working on it.

3411
02:34:23,290 --> 02:34:25,690
I'm just trying also to see everything around.

3412
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:30,980
Good.

3413
02:34:33,140 --> 02:34:35,140
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3414
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:36,640
See, like, there's stuff in...

3415
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:39,900
There's, like, stuff in here.

3416
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:42,260
I grabbed something, at least.

3417
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:43,820
I'm not quite sure... oh.

3418
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:44,180
Oh.

3419
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:45,400
There was more stuff.

3420
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:46,320
Some more ammo.

3421
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:46,820
Nice.

3422
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:48,380
Okay.

3423
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:49,100
Okay.

3424
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:52,500
Which...

3425
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,580
I'm still on this because I'm using the grenades, but...

3426
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:58,340
All right.

3427
02:34:59,320 --> 02:34:59,800
Ikimashou.

3428
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:01,880
Oh, uh, in here.

3429
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:05,220
Storm, drain, hatch.

3430
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:15,480
What did that open up?

3431
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:19,360
Uh...

3432
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:26,060
I did see this here.

3433
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:30,940
Nice.

3434
02:35:30,940 --> 02:35:31,200
Nice.

3435
02:35:38,980 --> 02:35:39,660
Ah!

3436
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:41,620
Okay.

3437
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:42,860
All righty.

3438
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,380
Storm, drain.

3439
02:35:44,960 --> 02:35:46,340
Did we see anything like that?

3440
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:49,360
Yeah, yeah.

3441
02:35:54,350 --> 02:35:55,330
Not yet.

3442
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:56,170
Okay.

3443
02:35:57,210 --> 02:35:58,270
So maybe it was...

3444
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:06,420
But it says...

3445
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:08,100
Storm, drain, hatch that way.

3446
02:36:10,760 --> 02:36:12,160
You saw a sign.

3447
02:36:13,240 --> 02:36:14,960
Yeah, I did.

3448
02:36:17,720 --> 02:36:18,360
Uh...

3449
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:26,100
Nan-toka...

3450
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:26,540
Ha-ha...

3451
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:27,020
Mizu-guchi?

3452
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:29,320
Ay-te-imashu.

3453
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:40,940
The, say, the...

3454
02:36:40,940 --> 02:36:42,180
Storm, drain, hatch.

3455
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:42,800
Hook.

3456
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,900
Storm, drain, hatch.

3457
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:46,700
Doko?

3458
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:57,380
Nuhahaha...

3459
02:36:57,380 --> 02:36:58,200
Near the sign.

3460
02:36:58,200 --> 02:36:58,280
Okay.

3461
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:00,920
I passed it?

3462
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:01,500
I did?

3463
02:37:05,110 --> 02:37:05,950
Oh, my God.

3464
02:37:07,050 --> 02:37:08,090
It feels like he's faster.

3465
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:13,300
Oh, my gosh.

3466
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:13,960
That's sneaky.

3467
02:37:18,400 --> 02:37:19,320
Oh, my God.

3468
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:34,900
Was that a mine?

3469
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:36,600
Oh, my gosh.

3470
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,780
This is so messed up.

3471
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:40,000
This is so messed up.

3472
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:47,060
Careful, snake.

3473
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:48,420
Okay, hold on.

3474
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:49,100
Maybe I should have...

3475
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:49,980
Okay.

3476
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:51,260
Save.

3477
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:52,160
Run.

3478
02:38:07,310 --> 02:38:09,150
Does the helicopter not come back anymore?

3479
02:38:09,410 --> 02:38:10,050
Oh, just kidding.

3480
02:38:10,270 --> 02:38:10,630
Just kidding.

3481
02:38:17,980 --> 02:38:20,460
You can see where the mines are buried, you can?

3482
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:27,220
He's trying.

3483
02:38:28,460 --> 02:38:29,720
He's trying.

3484
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:32,860
Stop it, please.

3485
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:34,020
This is hard enough.

3486
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:36,020
Is it where that's...

3487
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:39,080
Where can you see?

3488
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:41,520
Where can you see?

3489
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:45,400
I can't... I can't tell at all.

3490
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:52,300
You can't.

3491
02:39:02,830 --> 02:39:05,670
You have to use nades or shoot the brown in the original.

3492
02:39:06,030 --> 02:39:07,970
Wait, they didn't even give us new grenades.

3493
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:10,430
They haven't even given us that.

3494
02:39:10,890 --> 02:39:11,590
We're all over them.

3495
02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:12,910
Yeah.

3496
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:14,230
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3497
02:39:17,590 --> 02:39:18,150
Let's see.

3498
02:39:18,190 --> 02:39:18,190
Let's see.

3499
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:19,570
How do we wanna...

3500
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:20,610
Oh, I'm stuck.

3501
02:39:20,770 --> 02:39:21,050
There we go.

3502
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:38,400
Wait, what was that?

3503
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:40,400
What is that?

3504
02:39:41,140 --> 02:39:42,300
What just bounced?

3505
02:39:48,340 --> 02:39:49,280
It's a bug?

3506
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:49,980
Oh, okay.

3507
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:51,200
It's spooking me.

3508
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,300
It's spooking me.

3509
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:53,640
Okay.

3510
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:54,440
Sniper.

3511
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:55,760
Get down, boss.

3512
02:39:56,380 --> 02:39:57,980
That's an enemy good ship.

3513
02:40:00,100 --> 02:40:00,980
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3514
02:40:14,810 --> 02:40:16,850
I think I'm getting hit though, am I not?

3515
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:18,350
I think I'm getting hit.

3516
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:23,310
Oh, please leave me alone!

3517
02:40:34,380 --> 02:40:35,160
Okay, hold on.

3518
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:37,740
Where?

3519
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:46,700
There was one that I didn't use!

3520
02:40:47,240 --> 02:40:47,800
Where did

3521
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:55,920
I...

3522
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:57,440
That's messed up.

3523
02:40:58,300 --> 02:40:59,580
That's so messed up!

3524
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:00,420
I eated it.

3525
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:04,500
It despawned!

3526
02:41:06,140 --> 02:41:07,480
Okay, well...

3527
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,280
I think we're just gonna...

3528
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:11,220
Wait.

3529
02:41:12,030 --> 02:41:12,440
Hold on.

3530
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:16,320
Okay, let's just run for it.

3531
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:28,750
I'll...

3532
02:41:28,750 --> 02:41:30,070
I wish I'd do where to go.

3533
02:41:30,810 --> 02:41:31,230
Oh!

3534
02:41:33,310 --> 02:41:35,310
I think I see where the mines are.

3535
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:38,430
I think I see where they are!

3536
02:41:42,370 --> 02:41:43,930
Oh my goodness, this is...

3537
02:41:43,930 --> 02:41:44,770
This is tricky.

3538
02:41:58,170 --> 02:41:59,730
That's an enemy good ship.

3539
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:02,970
A single burst from this machine gun can cut a man in half.

3540
02:42:03,290 --> 02:42:04,330
Tread carefully.

3541
02:42:07,890 --> 02:42:10,970
Oh, it's crabs rising, not the mines.

3542
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:12,230
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3543
02:42:14,690 --> 02:42:16,790
I wish I could get rid of this stinking...

3544
02:42:20,550 --> 02:42:21,670
Is this where I need to go?

3545
02:42:27,230 --> 02:42:27,590
Please!

3546
02:42:28,190 --> 02:42:28,550
Leave!

3547
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:52,280
Let's just hope that we get some health.

3548
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:54,260
Let's just hope and pray.

3549
02:42:56,720 --> 02:42:58,120
Let's hope and pray.

3550
02:42:58,820 --> 02:42:59,880
What happened?

3551
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:00,860
Ladder hard.

3552
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:01,660
That's what happened.

3553
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:06,760
Wait, it's the valve sound.

3554
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:14,930
Woo!

3555
02:43:26,750 --> 02:43:28,290
I wonder if that got anybody.

3556
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:41,480
Yeah!

3557
02:43:44,260 --> 02:43:45,500
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

3558
02:43:45,660 --> 02:43:46,860
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

3559
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:48,120
I'm gonna die!

3560
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:48,920
I'm gonna die for real?

3561
02:43:49,220 --> 02:43:50,380
I don't even do...

3562
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,520
That was just one more hit and I'm dead.

3563
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:57,080
Where is it?

3564
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:00,280
I think it's like right here.

3565
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:01,380
No?

3566
02:44:06,510 --> 02:44:07,250
Yeah, baby!

3567
02:44:07,470 --> 02:44:07,690
Yeah!

3568
02:44:10,130 --> 02:44:11,090
Oh my gosh!

3569
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:15,770
I guess I don't need to be in there.

3570
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:20,950
Who are you talking to?

3571
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:29,480
I don't wanna fall out and then...

3572
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:33,860
Accidentally, like...

3573
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:35,540
Slip or something, you know?

3574
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:37,720
Cause you know I would!

3575
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:39,420
Okay, baby!

3576
02:44:40,300 --> 02:44:41,220
Fall out?

3577
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,540
Los Angeles?

3578
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:51,680
Get him in the foot.

3579
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:51,960
Oh!

3580
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:07,250
How do I get that?

3581
02:45:08,650 --> 02:45:09,870
Do I slide?

3582
02:45:11,510 --> 02:45:12,730
I'm gonna make a deuce.

3583
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:13,670
What's the point?

3584
02:45:13,890 --> 02:45:15,930
I'll just redo this part if I don't make it.

3585
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:18,110
Uh...

3586
02:45:18,110 --> 02:45:19,370
Wait, it won't let me...

3587
02:45:19,370 --> 02:45:19,690
Wait...

3588
02:45:19,690 --> 02:45:20,130
Oh gosh!

3589
02:45:20,930 --> 02:45:21,510
What is it?

3590
02:45:21,610 --> 02:45:22,290
Shift to walk?

3591
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:23,010
There we go, okay.

3592
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:25,230
Uh...

3593
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:29,680
The ledge?

3594
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:32,740
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get to, but I'm afraid if I jump...

3595
02:45:34,680 --> 02:45:35,040
Oh...

3596
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:36,580
Okay...

3597
02:45:42,170 --> 02:45:43,370
Okay, nice!

3598
02:45:44,190 --> 02:45:44,550
Anybody?

3599
02:45:45,550 --> 02:45:46,950
Just a broken turret.

3600
02:45:58,850 --> 02:45:59,620
I'm creeping!

3601
02:45:59,960 --> 02:46:00,980
I'm creeping along!

3602
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:04,760
What's that sound?

3603
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:08,460
What's that sound?

3604
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:15,180
No!

3605
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:17,180
I'm gonna die!

3606
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:34,100
I did a hundred percent...

3607
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:36,260
...percent call it.

3608
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:41,880
Dang it.

3609
02:46:42,820 --> 02:46:44,420
I think I just lost that guy too.

3610
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:45,680
I don't think he's gonna come back.

3611
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:51,460
Okay, we got that one.

3612
02:46:52,940 --> 02:46:54,080
But where'd that other guy go?

3613
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:54,660
Oh, there he is.

3614
02:46:59,260 --> 02:46:59,980
My flashlight?

3615
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:00,620
Oh, thank you.

3616
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:02,680
Okay.

3617
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:05,760
Now we get this guy down here.

3618
02:47:17,460 --> 02:47:18,860
Get his little booty.

3619
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:24,940
Artichokey.

3620
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:28,480
We just have to...

3621
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:31,360
...not have that guy throw a grenade at us.

3622
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:37,460
I think I'm just gonna have to...

3623
02:47:37,460 --> 02:47:39,600
I only have 18 health.

3624
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,140
And it's because I fell.

3625
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:45,360
Part of me wants to reload...

3626
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:48,960
...from my last quick save.

3627
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:51,840
Yeah...

3628
02:47:52,980 --> 02:47:54,260
I can do it!

3629
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:55,460
Okay.

3630
02:47:55,460 --> 02:47:56,540
If you guys believe.

3631
02:47:56,980 --> 02:47:57,700
If you guys believe.

3632
02:47:57,700 --> 02:47:58,520
If you guys believe, I'll believe.

3633
02:47:59,160 --> 02:47:59,920
I don't believe.

3634
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:12,880
Where is he?

3635
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:13,060
Oh.

3636
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:16,300
I got him.

3637
02:48:22,430 --> 02:48:23,570
Save every kill.

3638
02:48:24,370 --> 02:48:24,890
Stop!

3639
02:48:25,150 --> 02:48:25,870
That's what I'm doing!

3640
02:48:27,990 --> 02:48:28,510
Stop!

3641
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:29,830
Oh!

3642
02:48:31,470 --> 02:48:33,790
It's a good thing I saved after every kill, eh?

3643
02:48:38,890 --> 02:48:41,690
It's a good thing I saved after every kill, huh?

3644
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:43,430
Wait, how do I get down?

3645
02:48:44,230 --> 02:48:44,730
Oh.

3646
02:48:46,210 --> 02:48:46,710
Oh.

3647
02:48:51,940 --> 02:48:52,720
Where are you?

3648
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:53,940
Where are you, mister?

3649
02:48:54,860 --> 02:48:55,680
Where are you?

3650
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:02,100
He's already dead!

3651
02:49:05,260 --> 02:49:06,620
Okay, alright.

3652
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:17,200
But I know what I must do.

3653
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:22,870
Let's take this guy out.

3654
02:49:23,930 --> 02:49:24,830
Wh-where is he?

3655
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:29,670
Ah, there he is.

3656
02:49:30,630 --> 02:49:31,490
I think.

3657
02:49:32,530 --> 02:49:34,370
Alright, I saw someone running.

3658
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:37,190
Oh, there he is.

3659
02:49:39,210 --> 02:49:39,930
Nice!

3660
02:49:40,430 --> 02:49:41,130
Okay.

3661
02:49:41,890 --> 02:49:43,570
Let's attempt this again.

3662
02:49:44,610 --> 02:49:48,190
I think a snark is good- or rather better for...

3663
02:49:48,190 --> 02:49:49,770
larger amounts of people.

3664
02:49:50,050 --> 02:49:50,850
I'd say.

3665
02:49:51,150 --> 02:49:52,650
In the backpack again.

3666
02:49:53,270 --> 02:49:54,150
Okay, here we go.

3667
02:49:54,450 --> 02:49:55,270
Nice and easy.

3668
02:49:57,350 --> 02:49:58,070
Okay.

3669
02:49:58,550 --> 02:49:59,610
Nice and easy.

3670
02:50:01,490 --> 02:50:02,210
Oh!

3671
02:50:02,210 --> 02:50:02,450
Oh!

3672
02:50:05,230 --> 02:50:05,670
Okay.

3673
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:08,170
Nice and easy.

3674
02:50:10,910 --> 02:50:11,790
We did it.

3675
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:12,710
We did it.

3676
02:50:13,650 --> 02:50:14,630
We did it!

3677
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:16,330
Okay.

3678
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:21,280
Good job.

3679
02:50:21,580 --> 02:50:21,800
Team.

3680
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:32,910
Hold on.

3681
02:50:32,990 --> 02:50:35,390
Before we go over that way, let me see if there was anything.

3682
02:50:35,390 --> 02:50:36,570
Yeah, because there's like a little...

3683
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:37,630
Excuse you.

3684
02:50:37,850 --> 02:50:38,050
Please.

3685
02:50:38,510 --> 02:50:39,530
There's like a...

3686
02:50:43,580 --> 02:50:44,020
Um...

3687
02:50:44,020 --> 02:50:44,760
Am I...

3688
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:45,540
Going...

3689
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:46,240
Am I...

3690
02:50:46,720 --> 02:50:47,480
Am I...

3691
02:50:47,480 --> 02:50:48,600
Am I gonna die?

3692
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:50,240
Let's see.

3693
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:50,680
Hold on.

3694
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:52,400
Can I walk on top of this?

3695
02:51:12,310 --> 02:51:13,330
Now what?

3696
02:51:14,970 --> 02:51:16,210
Walk the rope?

3697
02:51:23,190 --> 02:51:23,870
Tight.

3698
02:51:24,270 --> 02:51:24,830
Tight.

3699
02:51:25,190 --> 02:51:25,290
Okay.

3700
02:51:25,790 --> 02:51:26,550
We can do this.

3701
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:58,740
And then I'm gonna kill this guy one shot.

3702
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:02,720
I...

3703
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:04,120
I have a little bit of blood loss.

3704
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:05,200
Oh, shoot.

3705
02:52:05,480 --> 02:52:06,300
No, no, no, no, God.

3706
02:52:06,480 --> 02:52:07,180
No, God, please.

3707
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:09,840
Please, no.

3708
02:52:12,160 --> 02:52:12,480
No!

3709
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:13,500
No!

3710
02:52:15,380 --> 02:52:15,920
Ah!

3711
02:52:22,470 --> 02:52:23,590
There's so much in there.

3712
02:52:23,810 --> 02:52:24,130
Wait.

3713
02:52:24,350 --> 02:52:24,570
Whoa.

3714
02:52:25,590 --> 02:52:26,130
Whoa!

3715
02:52:35,530 --> 02:52:36,070
Yes!

3716
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:37,970
Wait, where is it?

3717
02:52:38,130 --> 02:52:38,390
This...

3718
02:52:38,390 --> 02:52:39,470
This bad boy here.

3719
02:52:42,630 --> 02:52:43,710
Can I...

3720
02:52:45,270 --> 02:52:46,190
Wait, where'd it go?

3721
02:52:49,110 --> 02:52:50,110
What did that do?

3722
02:52:55,820 --> 02:52:57,320
Oh, you guided!

3723
02:52:58,080 --> 02:52:58,880
Okay, hold on.

3724
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:03,900
It follows the laser.

3725
02:53:04,140 --> 02:53:04,560
Oh!

3726
02:53:06,620 --> 02:53:07,100
Okay.

3727
02:53:14,330 --> 02:53:14,810
Uh...

3728
02:53:14,810 --> 02:53:15,650
How do I do this?

3729
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:22,500
Hey!

3730
02:53:29,830 --> 02:53:30,690
Alt fire?

3731
02:53:30,930 --> 02:53:32,330
Or right click turns off the laser?

3732
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:32,730
Oh!

3733
02:53:32,910 --> 02:53:34,210
The right click turns off the laser, yeah.

3734
02:53:41,370 --> 02:53:43,170
You painted my side!

3735
02:53:43,570 --> 02:53:44,930
Be gone with you!

3736
02:53:47,930 --> 02:53:48,690
Felt good.

3737
02:53:49,910 --> 02:53:50,630
Revenge, yeah!

3738
02:53:50,730 --> 02:53:51,350
The revenge!

3739
02:53:52,450 --> 02:53:53,370
Revenge is sweet.

3740
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:58,260
Oh, okay.

3741
02:53:58,360 --> 02:53:59,380
We gotta keep going this way.

3742
02:54:00,900 --> 02:54:04,440
So then it's actually really good that we took it down, because we would've had to...

3743
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:07,300
Oh, this is a ladder.

3744
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:07,380
There.

3745
02:54:08,580 --> 02:54:09,780
Oh, okay.

3746
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:15,080
We would've had to go across all of this with it still flying around?

3747
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:15,640
Hell no!

3748
02:54:18,500 --> 02:54:21,320
I wish this was Minecraft, where if I...

3749
02:54:21,320 --> 02:54:22,300
You know...

3750
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,300
If I'm crouched...

3751
02:54:25,980 --> 02:54:27,040
It won't...

3752
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:27,940
I can't...

3753
02:54:27,940 --> 02:54:29,740
I think you missed a ration.

3754
02:54:30,340 --> 02:54:31,100
Wait, I did?

3755
02:54:32,420 --> 02:54:33,040
Wait...

3756
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:33,520
I did?

3757
02:54:34,100 --> 02:54:35,200
I hear...

3758
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:36,640
I...

3759
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:43,840
Oops!

3760
02:54:44,100 --> 02:54:44,440
Oop!

3761
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:45,060
Oop!

3762
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:45,940
Oop!

3763
02:54:50,090 --> 02:54:51,350
Oh, it's a joke.

3764
02:54:51,930 --> 02:54:53,410
Very funny, Mr...

3765
02:54:53,410 --> 02:54:54,250
Mr. Funny Man!

3766
02:54:55,210 --> 02:54:56,410
Very funny!

3767
02:54:57,930 --> 02:54:59,310
You're so funny!

3768
02:55:03,590 --> 02:55:05,030
You're so funny!

3769
02:55:07,470 --> 02:55:10,190
The last block should just be a really long ladder.

3770
02:55:10,330 --> 02:55:10,910
Don't say that!

3771
02:55:11,250 --> 02:55:12,250
It's terrible!

3772
02:55:13,170 --> 02:55:13,610
Okay, hold on.

3773
02:55:13,970 --> 02:55:15,530
Wait, I don't wanna use this on...

3774
02:55:15,530 --> 02:55:16,010
Okay, hold on.

3775
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:22,020
Okay.

3776
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:27,820
Gosh!

3777
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:28,400
Who...

3778
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:29,640
Who was traversing this?

3779
02:55:29,800 --> 02:55:30,760
I heard...

3780
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:32,360
I heard critters, so...

3781
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:33,500
I'm kinda like...

3782
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:34,140
On edge.

3783
02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:34,740
Oh!

3784
02:55:35,740 --> 02:55:36,660
There they are.

3785
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:37,600
There's...

3786
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:39,860
There's the stinking critters!

3787
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:40,080
Gosh!

3788
02:55:50,930 --> 02:55:53,550
Alrighty, we're back...

3789
02:55:54,020 --> 02:55:54,550
Inside?

3790
02:55:58,850 --> 02:55:59,910
More

3791
02:56:04,830 --> 02:56:05,370
military?

3792
02:56:06,270 --> 02:56:07,810
Maybe they'll come to me.

3793
02:56:25,370 --> 02:56:26,600
What's on the other side?

3794
02:56:33,980 --> 02:56:34,520
Okay...

3795
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:48,160
Can I get them?

3796
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:53,250
What if I...

3797
02:56:53,250 --> 02:56:54,110
Pull this out?

3798
02:56:56,370 --> 02:56:56,850
Okay...

3799
02:56:56,850 --> 02:56:58,170
Alright, I'm just gonna go.

3800
02:57:04,800 --> 02:57:05,280
Wait...

3801
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:06,060
Which way do I go?

3802
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:07,280
Oh!

3803
02:57:23,150 --> 02:57:24,410
Can we up the music?

3804
02:57:26,450 --> 02:57:28,410
I don't think you can up just the music.

3805
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:38,080
What if I throw this little guy out?

3806
02:58:07,750 --> 02:58:09,550
I only have one of...

3807
02:58:09,550 --> 02:58:10,250
One bullet left.

3808
02:58:10,590 --> 02:58:11,090
So...

3809
02:58:11,090 --> 02:58:12,470
Maybe I...

3810
02:58:12,470 --> 02:58:13,210
Throw a couple more?

3811
02:58:14,810 --> 02:58:15,410
Oh...

3812
02:58:21,070 --> 02:58:22,250
I think it died.

3813
02:58:33,550 --> 02:58:34,430
Oh my god!

3814
02:58:39,270 --> 02:58:40,210
Okay, hold on.

3815
02:58:40,350 --> 02:58:42,430
Let's try and see what the other direction does.

3816
02:58:45,450 --> 02:58:46,970
If I run the other direction.

3817
02:58:53,970 --> 02:58:54,610
Woah.

3818
02:58:55,530 --> 02:58:56,450
Get down.

3819
02:58:57,450 --> 02:58:58,230
Get down.

3820
02:58:58,670 --> 02:58:58,830
Get down.

3821
02:58:59,470 --> 02:59:00,450
Do not.

3822
02:59:00,910 --> 02:59:01,290
Kemochi!

3823
02:59:08,310 --> 02:59:08,630
Okay.

3824
02:59:09,330 --> 02:59:10,550
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3825
02:59:13,210 --> 02:59:14,630
Alright, I'm just gonna die.

3826
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:23,450
Why'd the BG...

3827
02:59:23,450 --> 02:59:25,030
The BGM said that you're not...

3828
02:59:25,030 --> 02:59:29,990
It literally was just like you're not cool enough for the BGM so we're just gonna...

3829
02:59:32,750 --> 02:59:35,490
We're gonna... Oh my gosh, please, please, let me go.

3830
02:59:38,690 --> 02:59:43,010
You're not cool enough for the BGM, so we're just gonna not play it.

3831
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:45,690
Throw like three?

3832
02:59:46,090 --> 02:59:49,430
It barely did anything before they beat him, blew him up.

3833
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:19,060
Medic.

3834
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:20,580
Okay.

3835
03:00:23,900 --> 03:00:25,100
Just one is useless?

3836
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:25,720
Oh, okay.

3837
03:00:25,720 --> 03:00:27,840
Sorry, I don't know how to use them still yet.

3838
03:00:28,780 --> 03:00:29,810
If I go up...

3839
03:00:33,450 --> 03:00:34,810
Oh, oh, oh.

3840
03:00:41,980 --> 03:00:43,240
This part's tricky.

3841
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:46,560
Okay, hold on.

3842
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:50,060
I don't even know where I need to go, so...

3843
03:00:50,060 --> 03:00:50,600
Okay, throw.

3844
03:00:51,460 --> 03:00:51,960
Throw.

3845
03:00:52,860 --> 03:00:53,360
Throw.

3846
03:00:58,640 --> 03:01:01,000
I don't think you can stealth in this park, can you?

3847
03:01:07,780 --> 03:01:08,760
Is that friendly fire?

3848
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:09,280
Oh...

3849
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:12,900
If only I had gotten that guy.

3850
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:19,080
It's possible, but not for long.

3851
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:21,220
Okay, maybe if I like hug a wall or something.

3852
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:26,420
I'm going to save...

3853
03:01:26,420 --> 03:01:27,800
And see...

3854
03:01:27,800 --> 03:01:28,780
Because...

3855
03:01:28,780 --> 03:01:30,240
There was clearly some friendly fire.

3856
03:01:30,680 --> 03:01:30,980
Right?

3857
03:01:31,380 --> 03:01:33,500
So we're gonna see what the damage is.

3858
03:01:38,430 --> 03:01:39,630
You know...

3859
03:01:40,630 --> 03:01:42,790
Could be that a lot of them blew up...

3860
03:01:42,790 --> 03:01:43,930
Because they were silly.

3861
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:45,630
Not stupid.

3862
03:01:46,210 --> 03:01:46,890
That's a meme.

3863
03:01:48,270 --> 03:01:49,470
Why is my flashlight on?

3864
03:01:49,550 --> 03:01:49,810
Thank you.

3865
03:01:57,450 --> 03:01:58,170
Oh my gosh.

3866
03:02:08,600 --> 03:02:09,860
Okay, alright, hold on.

3867
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,620
There's still quite a few guys, it seems.

3868
03:02:12,820 --> 03:02:14,680
Okay, let's just use this instead.

3869
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:17,880
Revolver mint a lot.

3870
03:02:35,390 --> 03:02:36,930
I could hear the...

3871
03:02:36,930 --> 03:02:37,930
The tank.

3872
03:02:47,350 --> 03:02:48,110
There we go.

3873
03:02:48,310 --> 03:02:48,430
Okay.

3874
03:02:50,990 --> 03:02:53,070
Why is it autoing my flashlight on?

3875
03:03:04,540 --> 03:03:05,260
I'm stuck.

3876
03:03:05,460 --> 03:03:05,760
I'm stuck.

3877
03:03:05,960 --> 03:03:06,340
I'm stuck.

3878
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:07,520
Please, let me move.

3879
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:08,560
Please, let me move.

3880
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:10,480
Please, please, let me move.

3881
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:12,560
Please, please, please.

3882
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:13,460
There we go.

3883
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:14,100
Oh my gosh.

3884
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:16,240
Why do I have to jump crouch into the little...

3885
03:03:16,240 --> 03:03:17,300
Into the little hole?

3886
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:23,300
Which one is the one that is...

3887
03:03:23,300 --> 03:03:24,340
The tank?

3888
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:26,440
I'm guessing the tank is here then.

3889
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:32,540
Fire in the hole.

3890
03:03:38,840 --> 03:03:39,360
Oops.

3891
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:45,520
Oh, please, please, hold on.

3892
03:03:54,980 --> 03:03:55,380
Scones!

3893
03:03:57,440 --> 03:03:58,480
Okay, okay, hold on.

3894
03:03:58,840 --> 03:03:59,360
This is fine.

3895
03:03:59,560 --> 03:04:00,240
This is actually...

3896
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:00,660
This is good.

3897
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:02,260
We'll go to the other side.

3898
03:04:02,360 --> 03:04:03,200
We'll go to this side instead.

3899
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:04,560
Okay, okay, okay.

3900
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,040
Okay, okay, okay.

3901
03:04:06,460 --> 03:04:06,860
Scones!

3902
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:07,800
Okay.

3903
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:10,260
Well, I wouldn't say good.

3904
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:11,580
This is something.

3905
03:04:16,960 --> 03:04:17,360
Okay.

3906
03:04:22,430 --> 03:04:23,070
Use snarks.

3907
03:04:23,310 --> 03:04:23,410
Use snarks.

3908
03:04:23,410 --> 03:04:23,970
Will it even...

3909
03:04:23,970 --> 03:04:25,090
I only have one left.

3910
03:04:25,330 --> 03:04:26,010
Will it even do anything?

3911
03:04:30,230 --> 03:04:31,990
Yeah, see, I didn't even do anything, you guys.

3912
03:04:33,290 --> 03:04:34,870
But I used him because you told me to.

3913
03:04:37,130 --> 03:04:37,450
Okay.

3914
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:48,640
Friendly fire!

3915
03:04:59,430 --> 03:05:00,370
Wait, I saw him?

3916
03:05:03,670 --> 03:05:06,450
That was not where I shot you, but okay, buddy.

3917
03:05:08,830 --> 03:05:09,590
Clueless tank.

3918
03:05:12,470 --> 03:05:12,990
Okay.

3919
03:05:13,850 --> 03:05:15,210
I should be reloading.

3920
03:05:16,350 --> 03:05:16,990
Okay.

3921
03:05:19,810 --> 03:05:21,290
Oh, hostile's clear?

3922
03:05:21,710 --> 03:05:22,330
Nice.

3923
03:05:26,930 --> 03:05:27,850
Um, cool.

3924
03:05:28,230 --> 03:05:28,450
Okay.

3925
03:05:29,090 --> 03:05:33,430
I don't have any C4 for the tank, but we might be able to...

3926
03:05:36,830 --> 03:05:37,850
Do this.

3927
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:42,640
It's just saved, so why not?

3928
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:51,420
It's not even smokin'.

3929
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:53,020
It's not even smokin'.

3930
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:53,780
Hit it with your cur...

3931
03:05:53,780 --> 03:05:54,520
Wait, there's more.

3932
03:06:02,350 --> 03:06:03,610
Oh, there it is!

3933
03:06:06,370 --> 03:06:07,090
What mission?

3934
03:06:07,850 --> 03:06:08,470
What's that?

3935
03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:15,420
It's not even smokin'.

3936
03:06:15,420 --> 03:06:15,900
Lookin'.

3937
03:06:15,900 --> 03:06:16,820
The upper part.

3938
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:26,220
Aim for the tank's head.

3939
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:26,940
Oh yeah!

3940
03:06:30,660 --> 03:06:32,180
Try the crowbar!

3941
03:06:32,460 --> 03:06:32,840
Okay.

3942
03:06:33,160 --> 03:06:34,120
I did save.

3943
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:36,080
We can go crowbar it.

3944
03:06:58,750 --> 03:06:59,950
I can't...

3945
03:07:00,370 --> 03:07:01,630
Seem to get on top of it.

3946
03:07:06,510 --> 03:07:07,110
No!

3947
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:08,750
I'm so...

3948
03:07:08,750 --> 03:07:10,270
You guys, I'm too strong!

3949
03:07:10,570 --> 03:07:11,650
I can't do that!

3950
03:07:11,650 --> 03:07:11,730
No!

3951
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:19,380
What the heck?

3952
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:21,440
That was crazy.

3953
03:07:21,740 --> 03:07:22,560
That was so awesome.

3954
03:07:24,680 --> 03:07:25,940
What's going on in here?

3955
03:07:26,060 --> 03:07:26,660
More health.

3956
03:07:28,300 --> 03:07:29,320
Nothing else.

3957
03:07:34,130 --> 03:07:35,430
Let's explode this.

3958
03:07:41,460 --> 03:07:42,640
Let's grab everything.

3959
03:07:43,980 --> 03:07:46,440
Oh, okay.

3960
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:47,780
I can only grab a certain amount.

3961
03:07:47,780 --> 03:07:48,180
Oh, okay.

3962
03:07:49,400 --> 03:07:49,800
Um...

3963
03:07:49,800 --> 03:07:51,260
Let's try and see for it.

3964
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:52,400
Instead.

3965
03:07:53,960 --> 03:07:55,280
Since we...

3966
03:07:55,280 --> 03:07:57,100
Anti-tank crowbar.

3967
03:07:57,220 --> 03:07:57,480
Yes!

3968
03:07:57,640 --> 03:07:59,420
Gordon split it wide open!

3969
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:02,000
Holy cow!

3970
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:04,060
So if I throw it...

3971
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:06,060
Uh...

3972
03:08:06,060 --> 03:08:06,400
Good enough.

3973
03:08:06,620 --> 03:08:06,920
Maybe.

3974
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:09,760
Not good enough.

3975
03:08:20,330 --> 03:08:21,930
Too far.

3976
03:08:26,310 --> 03:08:27,190
Uh...

3977
03:08:29,810 --> 03:08:30,690
Uh...

3978
03:08:30,690 --> 03:08:31,090
Uh...

3979
03:08:31,090 --> 03:08:31,930
Run and jump and throw.

3980
03:08:32,750 --> 03:08:33,630
Uh...

3981
03:08:33,630 --> 03:08:34,670
Oh...

3982
03:08:34,670 --> 03:08:35,250
Okay...

3983
03:08:37,230 --> 03:08:38,610
How heavy is C4?

3984
03:08:39,050 --> 03:08:39,930
Did I get it?

3985
03:08:41,330 --> 03:08:42,210
Uh...

3986
03:08:42,210 --> 03:08:43,410
How...

3987
03:08:43,410 --> 03:08:44,870
How heavy is it?

3988
03:08:56,660 --> 03:08:57,540
Uh...

3989
03:09:00,080 --> 03:09:01,200
Stand near...

3990
03:09:01,200 --> 03:09:01,480
Okay.

3991
03:09:01,880 --> 03:09:02,020
Here.

3992
03:09:02,100 --> 03:09:02,720
Maybe like this.

3993
03:09:03,580 --> 03:09:03,720
Huh?

3994
03:09:04,300 --> 03:09:05,320
Oh my god!

3995
03:09:05,800 --> 03:09:06,260
Gordon!

3996
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:08,000
Gordon please!

3997
03:09:08,880 --> 03:09:09,200
Ha!

3998
03:09:11,600 --> 03:09:12,160
Oh!

3999
03:09:12,420 --> 03:09:12,520
Oh!

4000
03:09:12,680 --> 03:09:12,900
Oh!

4001
03:09:13,200 --> 03:09:13,780
Okay, okay, okay.

4002
03:09:19,910 --> 03:09:20,430
Maybe...

4003
03:09:20,430 --> 03:09:21,570
Does it take more than one?

4004
03:09:22,070 --> 03:09:22,630
Or...

4005
03:09:26,550 --> 03:09:27,810
It took damage.

4006
03:09:28,090 --> 03:09:28,350
Okay.

4007
03:09:28,910 --> 03:09:29,390
Okay.

4008
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:32,610
Well, I only have one left, so here's a helping.

4009
03:09:33,690 --> 03:09:34,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4010
03:09:57,360 --> 03:09:58,100
Yo, baby!

4011
03:10:03,460 --> 03:10:04,220
Yo, baby!

4012
03:10:05,500 --> 03:10:05,980
Okay.

4013
03:10:06,620 --> 03:10:07,320
Yo, baby!

4014
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:09,140
Is there anyone left?

4015
03:10:09,300 --> 03:10:11,800
Because before they were like chit-chatting.

4016
03:10:11,800 --> 03:10:14,800
And they were like, I'm gonna go check it out.

4017
03:10:15,940 --> 03:10:17,560
I don't think there's anybody left.

4018
03:10:18,260 --> 03:10:19,320
Oh, yes, there is.

4019
03:10:23,080 --> 03:10:24,780
I smoke too soon.

4020
03:10:30,990 --> 03:10:32,550
Oh, that's silly.

4021
03:10:34,130 --> 03:10:35,610
Okay, alright.

4022
03:10:36,930 --> 03:10:39,030
The guy didn't notice the tank exploding.

4023
03:10:39,850 --> 03:10:41,590
He doesn't need to notice.

4024
03:10:42,790 --> 03:10:47,070
He doesn't need to worry his pretty little head about nothing.

4025
03:10:48,730 --> 03:10:50,730
I'm cooking nothing.

4026
03:10:51,350 --> 03:10:52,710
I'm cooking nothing.

4027
03:11:06,660 --> 03:11:08,220
This looks like a trap.

4028
03:11:30,350 --> 03:11:33,330
She shoots and she scores, you guys.

4029
03:11:34,630 --> 03:11:39,060
Dang, I thought that would do more.

4030
03:11:45,660 --> 03:11:47,000
Oh, it's another tank!

4031
03:11:47,840 --> 03:11:49,180
Oh, it's another tank!

4032
03:11:50,360 --> 03:11:51,820
He can't turn around, can he?

4033
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:53,240
He can turn around!

4034
03:11:55,960 --> 03:11:57,260
Uh, okay.

4035
03:11:57,820 --> 03:11:58,520
Got it.

4036
03:12:05,320 --> 03:12:06,640
I can ignore it.

4037
03:12:06,700 --> 03:12:07,080
I can.

4038
03:12:10,060 --> 03:12:11,480
Well, what if I just...

4039
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:12,900
The door is where you want to go?

4040
03:12:13,080 --> 03:12:13,360
This one?

4041
03:12:14,100 --> 03:12:14,500
Ah!

4042
03:12:16,580 --> 03:12:16,980
Whoa!

4043
03:12:17,460 --> 03:12:19,020
Most doom-sounding ever.

4044
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:23,460
I... I know that.

4045
03:12:25,360 --> 03:12:26,520
Wait, I'm gonna reload.

4046
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:26,980
Sorry.

4047
03:12:27,340 --> 03:12:29,520
Um, I don't wanna be at 37 health.

4048
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:34,000
So, what I'm gonna do is not what I did just now.

4049
03:12:34,240 --> 03:12:35,400
I'm going to...

4050
03:12:35,400 --> 03:12:36,280
Uh...

4051
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:38,520
I'm going to not get hit.

4052
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:40,100
Pro- Ho- Hopefully.

4053
03:12:40,500 --> 03:12:40,780
Okay.

4054
03:12:48,540 --> 03:12:49,100
Gamer.

4055
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:55,560
Okay.

4056
03:12:56,040 --> 03:12:56,680
Just like that.

4057
03:12:59,160 --> 03:13:03,320
Exactly how I said I was gonna play.

4058
03:13:03,500 --> 03:13:04,000
Baby.

4059
03:13:05,660 --> 03:13:06,400
Oh, hello?

4060
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:07,940
Is this...

4061
03:13:11,660 --> 03:13:12,300
Hello?

4062
03:13:12,860 --> 03:13:13,840
Oh, there we go.

4063
03:13:23,370 --> 03:13:24,470
Oh, my God!

4064
03:13:25,090 --> 03:13:25,730
Bees!

4065
03:13:28,530 --> 03:13:29,170
Uh...

4066
03:13:29,810 --> 03:13:31,310
Maybe they would have friendly fired.

4067
03:13:31,310 --> 03:13:32,890
Maybe I messed up.

4068
03:13:33,450 --> 03:13:35,030
What a normal jet!

4069
03:13:35,390 --> 03:13:35,870
Yeah, yeah.

4070
03:13:44,180 --> 03:13:45,040
Okay, yeah.

4071
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:53,260
Mines.

4072
03:13:53,660 --> 03:13:53,900
Heh heh.

4073
03:13:54,220 --> 03:13:54,520
Cool.

4074
03:13:55,340 --> 03:13:56,620
In here also?

4075
03:13:57,180 --> 03:13:57,800
Or...

4076
03:13:57,800 --> 03:13:59,680
Ordnance storage facility.

4077
03:14:02,520 --> 03:14:03,700
There's, uh...

4078
03:14:03,700 --> 03:14:05,240
Crazy noises going on in there.

4079
03:14:05,400 --> 03:14:06,440
Confined space.

4080
03:14:06,440 --> 03:14:07,680
Entry can be fatal.

4081
03:14:07,860 --> 03:14:09,480
Enter by permit only.

4082
03:14:10,460 --> 03:14:10,920
Okay.

4083
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:14,680
Oh, dang it.

4084
03:14:17,400 --> 03:14:18,240
Uh...

4085
03:14:18,240 --> 03:14:19,360
Okay.

4086
03:14:20,300 --> 03:14:20,940
What's over here?

4087
03:14:21,240 --> 03:14:21,500
There...

4088
03:14:21,500 --> 03:14:23,240
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

4089
03:14:24,620 --> 03:14:26,180
Ah-ha-ha!

4090
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:27,940
Um...

4091
03:14:29,440 --> 03:14:30,280
Ah...

4092
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:31,740
Ah...

4093
03:14:31,740 --> 03:14:32,060
Ah...

4094
03:14:33,740 --> 03:14:34,580
Ah...

4095
03:14:36,200 --> 03:14:37,120
What?

4096
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:38,140
It's safe this side?

4097
03:14:38,140 --> 03:14:38,620
It is.

4098
03:14:42,520 --> 03:14:43,500
Are we sure?

4099
03:14:50,330 --> 03:14:50,790
Okay.

4100
03:14:53,730 --> 03:14:54,490
What's shooting?

4101
03:14:58,410 --> 03:14:59,470
Where's my permit?

4102
03:14:59,470 --> 03:14:59,610
Damn it.

4103
03:15:06,730 --> 03:15:08,090
Just normal.

4104
03:15:10,910 --> 03:15:12,170
Really normal.

4105
03:15:12,790 --> 03:15:14,930
Normal sounds are going on right now.

4106
03:15:15,870 --> 03:15:16,810
Oh my gosh.

4107
03:15:17,590 --> 03:15:20,630
It's like an actual total apocalypse going on.

4108
03:15:22,070 --> 03:15:23,510
Okay, nevermind.

4109
03:15:27,190 --> 03:15:29,050
I think I can jump this.

4110
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:32,030
Nice.

4111
03:15:34,150 --> 03:15:34,790
Hey!

4112
03:15:42,500 --> 03:15:43,140
Barney!

4113
03:15:43,800 --> 03:15:45,000
I'm here for you!

4114
03:15:45,960 --> 03:15:47,040
I'm sorry, Barney.

4115
03:15:47,860 --> 03:15:48,780
Oh my gosh.

4116
03:15:50,140 --> 03:15:51,100
It's a sniper!

4117
03:15:55,940 --> 03:15:57,320
Is he still alive?

4118
03:15:58,780 --> 03:15:59,420
I

4119
03:16:02,710 --> 03:16:04,150
don't think I got it.

4120
03:16:04,490 --> 03:16:06,010
They look focused on me.

4121
03:16:06,970 --> 03:16:07,630
Grenade it?

4122
03:16:07,830 --> 03:16:07,950
Okay.

4123
03:16:08,590 --> 03:16:09,270
Rocket it?

4124
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:16,400
Yeah, I think he's dead.

4125
03:16:19,020 --> 03:16:20,300
That's for killing Barney.

4126
03:16:26,620 --> 03:16:32,440
I don't think we've had a single Barney survive this stream.

4127
03:16:35,780 --> 03:16:39,840
Would you rather work here before the alien invasion or Aperture Science?

4128
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:44,420
I don't know, actually.

4129
03:16:45,580 --> 03:16:47,180
Wait, I do want to get these.

4130
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:49,540
Can I... if I... hold on.

4131
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:56,740
Dang it.

4132
03:16:57,960 --> 03:16:59,480
What era of Aperture?

4133
03:17:02,840 --> 03:17:03,820
I don't know.

4134
03:17:04,320 --> 03:17:04,860
I don't know.

4135
03:17:04,860 --> 03:17:07,980
I think I would really enjoy listening to GLaDOS's voice though.

4136
03:17:08,640 --> 03:17:10,080
She's got a really nice voice.

4137
03:17:10,080 --> 03:17:10,760
I'm just saying.

4138
03:17:12,040 --> 03:17:12,940
I'm just saying.

4139
03:17:13,160 --> 03:17:13,980
She sounds really...

4140
03:17:13,980 --> 03:17:15,440
She sounds really nice.

4141
03:17:15,820 --> 03:17:16,940
You know, she sounds so good.

4142
03:17:17,380 --> 03:17:19,040
She has a pretty...

4143
03:17:19,040 --> 03:17:20,120
pretty sound.

4144
03:17:20,120 --> 03:17:20,880
You know.

4145
03:17:26,800 --> 03:17:28,560
What the heck is this graffiti?

4146
03:17:29,320 --> 03:17:30,240
Can I go in here now?

4147
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:31,000
No.

4148
03:17:37,360 --> 03:17:38,300
Uh, yep.

4149
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:39,500
Near the wall.

4150
03:17:40,360 --> 03:17:41,320
Near the wall.

4151
03:17:44,990 --> 03:17:46,030
Near the wall.

4152
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:46,590
Near the wall.

4153
03:17:46,590 --> 03:17:46,990
Uh, sorry.

4154
03:17:47,130 --> 03:17:48,150
We're like...

4155
03:17:48,150 --> 03:17:48,750
Uh...

4156
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:49,510
Confined.

4157
03:17:51,330 --> 03:17:51,850
Inside.

4158
03:17:53,430 --> 03:17:53,950
Um...

4159
03:17:53,950 --> 03:17:55,370
There's like a lot of walls.

4160
03:17:56,110 --> 03:17:56,590
Just...

4161
03:17:56,590 --> 03:17:58,330
There's like a whole bunch of walls.

4162
03:18:00,070 --> 03:18:02,010
I have to go through the mines!

4163
03:18:05,850 --> 03:18:06,370
Okay.

4164
03:18:06,690 --> 03:18:07,110
Hold on.

4165
03:18:08,510 --> 03:18:09,450
Let's blow her up.

4166
03:18:24,540 --> 03:18:26,520
Here's the pistol, but I can't see them.

4167
03:18:30,300 --> 03:18:30,860
What?

4168
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:32,140
Just supposed to shoot everywhere?

4169
03:18:42,250 --> 03:18:43,510
Here's the crowbar!

4170
03:18:44,730 --> 03:18:46,570
I think I'm about to get blown up.

4171
03:18:58,910 --> 03:19:00,350
I tried shooting!

4172
03:19:03,330 --> 03:19:05,090
Oh, I got it this time.

4173
03:19:08,360 --> 03:19:10,200
Oh, why did I press F3?

4174
03:19:12,340 --> 03:19:12,900
Okay.

4175
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:18,640
Alright, you guys all saw.

4176
03:19:19,580 --> 03:19:21,120
Oh, I have to crawl through here.

4177
03:19:21,360 --> 03:19:22,820
Wait, what the hell is this?

4178
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:23,800
Where are mines?

4179
03:19:27,110 --> 03:19:28,210
Who's shooting me?

4180
03:19:28,630 --> 03:19:29,390
Wait, from where?

4181
03:19:29,610 --> 03:19:30,190
I'm gonna see.

4182
03:19:32,410 --> 03:19:38,550
Oh, he's behind me, you sneaky son of a gun.

4183
03:19:38,550 --> 03:19:39,050
Oh!

4184
03:19:39,430 --> 03:19:39,950
Oh!

4185
03:19:39,950 --> 03:19:40,950
Did you see that?

4186
03:19:42,490 --> 03:19:44,350
Did you see how fast he...

4187
03:19:44,350 --> 03:19:45,550
He was like...

4188
03:19:46,610 --> 03:19:47,650
At me...

4189
03:19:47,650 --> 03:19:49,130
Oh, you...

4190
03:19:49,130 --> 03:19:49,730
Oh, hold on.

4191
03:19:50,010 --> 03:19:50,910
We'll grenade him.

4192
03:19:52,230 --> 03:19:52,750
Ouch!

4193
03:19:53,630 --> 03:19:53,890
Oh,

4194
03:19:57,260 --> 03:19:58,440
I forgot to change my gun.

4195
03:19:59,500 --> 03:19:59,960
Oh, man.

4196
03:20:02,400 --> 03:20:03,380
Okay, there we go.

4197
03:20:09,010 --> 03:20:09,910
Is he dead?

4198
03:20:10,990 --> 03:20:11,590
Oh!

4199
03:20:11,890 --> 03:20:12,210
Nope.

4200
03:20:14,370 --> 03:20:14,930
Hold on.

4201
03:20:17,050 --> 03:20:18,970
Let's just use this then.

4202
03:20:19,490 --> 03:20:21,290
It's a little overkill, but you know.

4203
03:20:23,670 --> 03:20:24,370
Oh.

4204
03:20:37,560 --> 03:20:38,430
Did we kill him?

4205
03:20:49,290 --> 03:20:50,280
Did that kill him?

4206
03:20:50,740 --> 03:20:51,980
Oh my gosh.

4207
03:20:54,380 --> 03:20:56,360
I don't have any regular grenades.

4208
03:20:56,360 --> 03:20:57,980
Please stop suggesting grenades.

4209
03:20:57,980 --> 03:21:00,340
You can see my inventory right here.

4210
03:21:00,340 --> 03:21:01,940
I have no regular grenades.

4211
03:21:02,760 --> 03:21:05,340
The game has not given me them since I literally...

4212
03:21:06,460 --> 03:21:08,640
Since I literally had all my stuff taken away.

4213
03:21:15,740 --> 03:21:16,860
I'll try this again.

4214
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:21,140
I don't think that killed him though.

4215
03:21:24,420 --> 03:21:26,820
I can see him picking up his gun.

4216
03:21:31,180 --> 03:21:32,800
This guy is immortal!

4217
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:47,340
It has to be inside the hole.

4218
03:21:50,140 --> 03:21:51,060
So like...

4219
03:21:51,060 --> 03:21:52,620
But that's what I'm trying to do.

4220
03:21:53,260 --> 03:21:54,980
I'm trying to...

4221
03:21:55,820 --> 03:21:57,280
To get it inside the hole.

4222
03:21:59,220 --> 03:22:00,260
How did I die?

4223
03:22:02,460 --> 03:22:03,700
Was it a double kill?

4224
03:22:07,340 --> 03:22:08,760
Okay, I think it shot that.

4225
03:22:08,900 --> 03:22:09,500
And that's what happened.

4226
03:22:11,280 --> 03:22:11,700
Hold on.

4227
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:11,740
Ah!

4228
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:12,960
Okay, hold on.

4229
03:22:39,200 --> 03:22:41,080
Since I don't have very many left...

4230
03:22:41,080 --> 03:22:41,560
That's why I'm...

4231
03:22:41,560 --> 03:22:42,540
That's why I'm safe.

4232
03:22:43,900 --> 03:22:44,320
Okay!

4233
03:22:44,880 --> 03:22:45,660
Oh my goodness!

4234
03:22:46,240 --> 03:22:46,660
Gracious!

4235
03:22:47,260 --> 03:22:47,680
Mister!

4236
03:22:49,380 --> 03:22:51,480
Well, it's a good thing we shot this one down too.

4237
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:52,200
Because otherwise...

4238
03:22:52,780 --> 03:22:53,740
That would have been bad.

4239
03:22:55,760 --> 03:22:56,180
Okay.

4240
03:22:58,340 --> 03:22:59,800
Ellen McLean voice is nice.

4241
03:22:59,980 --> 03:23:00,860
She's in Half-Life too.

4242
03:23:01,460 --> 03:23:02,120
I see.

4243
03:23:04,200 --> 03:23:04,960
Also, door!

4244
03:23:05,140 --> 03:23:06,120
Thank you so much for the gift!

4245
03:23:06,240 --> 03:23:06,820
And thank you!

4246
03:23:12,040 --> 03:23:14,500
If I blow these up...

4247
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:18,930
Perfect.

4248
03:23:22,540 --> 03:23:24,440
That's not how that's supposed to work!

4249
03:23:29,310 --> 03:23:29,730
Now...

4250
03:23:30,510 --> 03:23:31,350
Um...

4251
03:23:34,050 --> 03:23:35,030
When I'm scared!

4252
03:23:35,030 --> 03:23:35,110
I'm scared!

4253
03:23:37,810 --> 03:23:38,650
Can we know?

4254
03:23:47,380 --> 03:23:48,060
Okay.

4255
03:23:48,340 --> 03:23:48,940
We got it!

4256
03:23:49,880 --> 03:23:50,900
We're in!

4257
03:23:51,580 --> 03:23:52,860
We're in, baby!

4258
03:23:55,340 --> 03:23:56,320
What's that sound?

4259
03:23:57,180 --> 03:23:57,580
Okay.

4260
03:23:58,440 --> 03:23:59,220
I think we're okay.

4261
03:23:59,600 --> 03:23:59,900
All right.

4262
03:24:00,120 --> 03:24:00,420
Yeah!

4263
03:24:02,120 --> 03:24:03,200
All right.

4264
03:24:03,560 --> 03:24:04,040
Uh...

4265
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:11,440
Where do we go, though?

4266
03:24:13,120 --> 03:24:14,240
Oh, never mind.

4267
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:15,940
Wait, hold on.

4268
03:24:16,940 --> 03:24:17,800
Figuring it out.

4269
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:19,000
I've got this!

4270
03:24:19,140 --> 03:24:19,660
Don't tell me!

4271
03:24:22,300 --> 03:24:22,740
Scientists!

4272
03:24:24,240 --> 03:24:25,540
Are you okay in there?

4273
03:24:32,990 --> 03:24:34,250
What was that?

4274
03:24:35,230 --> 03:24:35,670
Hello!

4275
03:24:36,630 --> 03:24:38,430
You're heading for the Lambda Complex, aren't you?

4276
03:24:38,610 --> 03:24:40,810
I was heading there myself, and so I wound up here and...

4277
03:24:40,810 --> 03:24:42,490
Well, simply, you've lost my nerve.

4278
03:24:42,830 --> 03:24:45,050
Take one look through that door, and you'll see what I mean.

4279
03:24:46,110 --> 03:24:48,250
I'm just going to wait out the catastrophe in here.

4280
03:24:48,550 --> 03:24:50,630
If you intend to go on, then I beg of you.

4281
03:24:50,990 --> 03:24:52,290
Proceed with extreme caution.

4282
03:24:53,090 --> 03:24:53,490
Okay.

4283
03:25:00,620 --> 03:25:01,020
Nice.

4284
03:25:02,760 --> 03:25:05,060
There wasn't anything out there that I needed, right?

4285
03:25:09,520 --> 03:25:11,020
How many turrets are there?

4286
03:25:12,920 --> 03:25:13,320
No?

4287
03:25:13,480 --> 03:25:13,840
Okay, good.

4288
03:25:15,080 --> 03:25:17,020
How many turrets are in here?

4289
03:25:17,680 --> 03:25:19,120
Wait, let's get our shotty.

4290
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:28,600
Good luck.

4291
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:30,880
No smoking in this area.

4292
03:25:33,940 --> 03:25:35,100
So I can't shoot?

4293
03:25:38,650 --> 03:25:39,670
I'll try.

4294
03:25:40,050 --> 03:25:41,110
This is a test.

4295
03:25:41,950 --> 03:25:43,490
This is a test.

4296
03:25:51,670 --> 03:25:52,330
Okay.

4297
03:25:53,730 --> 03:25:55,110
That was a test.

4298
03:25:55,930 --> 03:25:56,730
That was a test.

4299
03:25:57,650 --> 03:25:59,230
Don't say count one!

4300
03:25:59,690 --> 03:26:01,150
I don't even...

4301
03:26:01,150 --> 03:26:02,210
I don't even...

4302
03:26:02,210 --> 03:26:02,990
That was a test!

4303
03:26:05,950 --> 03:26:07,230
Oh, got something.

4304
03:26:07,430 --> 03:26:07,850
Nice, okay.

4305
03:26:09,810 --> 03:26:10,470
Okay.

4306
03:26:12,350 --> 03:26:13,090
Maybe I...

4307
03:26:13,090 --> 03:26:14,570
If I jump from here...

4308
03:26:14,570 --> 03:26:14,810
You know?

4309
03:26:21,920 --> 03:26:23,360
And if I get on top of this...

4310
03:26:24,360 --> 03:26:24,960
Hold on.

4311
03:26:25,100 --> 03:26:25,600
Watch this.

4312
03:26:25,800 --> 03:26:26,000
Watch.

4313
03:26:26,140 --> 03:26:26,860
Watch this.

4314
03:26:30,220 --> 03:26:30,820
Sorry.

4315
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:02,400
Okay, but that's so unfair!

4316
03:27:02,640 --> 03:27:03,500
It goes underneath!

4317
03:27:04,540 --> 03:27:06,240
How does that not work?

4318
03:27:26,900 --> 03:27:29,880
I should have saved after I jumped the second jump.

4319
03:27:37,690 --> 03:27:38,290
Okay.

4320
03:27:39,290 --> 03:27:40,910
Save after every step.

4321
03:27:41,130 --> 03:27:41,970
For real though.

4322
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:51,540
Oh my...

4323
03:27:51,540 --> 03:27:54,340
Wait, there's something smoking over there.

4324
03:27:54,420 --> 03:27:54,960
Is that party?

4325
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:07,140
Can I...

4326
03:28:07,140 --> 03:28:08,280
Go under the...

4327
03:28:08,280 --> 03:28:08,920
Can I...

4328
03:28:08,920 --> 03:28:10,180
Macarena under this or no?

4329
03:28:12,520 --> 03:28:13,000
Oh.

4330
03:28:13,220 --> 03:28:13,720
My bad.

4331
03:28:13,980 --> 03:28:14,800
I pressed...

4332
03:28:14,800 --> 03:28:15,180
I did...

4333
03:28:15,180 --> 03:28:16,160
I did press space.

4334
03:28:16,420 --> 03:28:17,780
But I don't think it...

4335
03:28:19,240 --> 03:28:19,720
Registered.

4336
03:28:19,900 --> 03:28:20,320
Oh boy.

4337
03:28:20,640 --> 03:28:21,180
Oh gosh.

4338
03:28:21,380 --> 03:28:21,820
Please no.

4339
03:28:22,420 --> 03:28:22,660
Oh.

4340
03:28:22,900 --> 03:28:23,520
Where are you?

4341
03:28:23,620 --> 03:28:23,980
No, no, no.

4342
03:28:25,640 --> 03:28:27,440
No, no, no, no.

4343
03:28:27,460 --> 03:28:27,860
No jumping.

4344
03:28:27,860 --> 03:28:28,280
No jumping.

4345
03:28:28,400 --> 03:28:28,760
No jumping.

4346
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:31,100
No jumping.

4347
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:31,560
No jumping.

4348
03:28:32,600 --> 03:28:32,900
Okay.

4349
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:33,820
At least we can shoot.

4350
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:38,740
Why is a Barney smoking?

4351
03:28:39,700 --> 03:28:41,500
Cause he's smoking high.

4352
03:28:42,220 --> 03:28:43,340
Wait, they're both smoking.

4353
03:28:44,380 --> 03:28:45,060
You okay?

4354
03:28:45,460 --> 03:28:46,440
What's wrong with you?

4355
03:28:48,320 --> 03:28:48,820
Okay.

4356
03:28:54,300 --> 03:28:54,600
Um...

4357
03:28:54,900 --> 03:28:55,680
Damn right.

4358
03:28:58,220 --> 03:29:00,660
Which half-life letter guards that far?

4359
03:29:00,960 --> 03:29:02,860
That would be Barney.

4360
03:29:04,020 --> 03:29:04,700
Yup.

4361
03:29:05,200 --> 03:29:06,320
You got it right.

4362
03:29:08,740 --> 03:29:09,920
Oh my gosh.

4363
03:29:10,820 --> 03:29:12,900
It's a maze, but...

4364
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:14,520
Oh.

4365
03:29:14,820 --> 03:29:16,180
I don't know where to go.

4366
03:29:17,100 --> 03:29:17,460
Okay.

4367
03:29:17,460 --> 03:29:17,640
Okay.

4368
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:17,820
Hold on.

4369
03:29:18,020 --> 03:29:19,400
I think I need to...

4370
03:29:22,880 --> 03:29:23,540
Oh gosh.

4371
03:29:23,560 --> 03:29:24,240
It scares me.

4372
03:29:25,500 --> 03:29:25,940
Hold on.

4373
03:29:25,980 --> 03:29:26,860
I don't want to be jump scared.

4374
03:29:26,880 --> 03:29:28,900
So I'm going to turn on the volume a little bit.

4375
03:29:34,280 --> 03:29:34,940
Hell yeah.

4376
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:35,520
I did that.

4377
03:29:37,400 --> 03:29:38,460
I hear another guy.

4378
03:29:38,640 --> 03:29:39,140
Oh my gosh.

4379
03:29:42,990 --> 03:29:43,350
Wait.

4380
03:29:43,690 --> 03:29:44,070
Come on.

4381
03:29:44,190 --> 03:29:44,390
Seriously?

4382
03:29:47,430 --> 03:29:49,070
Oh, I can't even get up there though.

4383
03:29:50,250 --> 03:29:50,550
My bad.

4384
03:29:54,150 --> 03:29:54,550
Um...

4385
03:29:54,550 --> 03:29:55,830
I think I can get over from here.

4386
03:29:56,130 --> 03:29:56,610
I guess.

4387
03:29:59,050 --> 03:29:59,890
Oh my gosh.

4388
03:30:01,570 --> 03:30:01,970
Uh...

4389
03:30:01,970 --> 03:30:02,770
How am I supposed to...

4390
03:30:02,770 --> 03:30:03,850
Can I crouch underneath this?

4391
03:30:04,910 --> 03:30:05,310
Okay.

4392
03:30:05,450 --> 03:30:06,410
This is a crouching one.

4393
03:30:08,590 --> 03:30:10,450
We have to make sure he doesn't jump.

4394
03:30:10,970 --> 03:30:11,370
Okay.

4395
03:30:11,570 --> 03:30:11,850
Alright.

4396
03:30:12,110 --> 03:30:12,270
Alright.

4397
03:30:12,270 --> 03:30:12,610
Alright.

4398
03:30:12,610 --> 03:30:12,650
Alright.

4399
03:30:14,570 --> 03:30:15,010
Alright.

4400
03:30:15,450 --> 03:30:15,510
Alright.

4401
03:30:16,150 --> 03:30:16,250
Alright.

4402
03:30:17,810 --> 03:30:18,250
Okay.

4403
03:30:20,750 --> 03:30:22,930
I'll turn it up a little because it's kind of hard to hear.

4404
03:30:24,230 --> 03:30:25,190
How I just did.

4405
03:30:36,130 --> 03:30:38,610
I didn't know what the button would do.

4406
03:30:39,070 --> 03:30:40,550
Don't say, me toe.

4407
03:30:40,970 --> 03:30:41,950
You should have broken that.

4408
03:30:41,950 --> 03:30:43,550
The one time I don't break a box.

4409
03:30:44,110 --> 03:30:47,270
The one time, literally, that I don't break a box.

4410
03:30:47,430 --> 03:30:49,110
Is the one time...

4411
03:30:49,110 --> 03:30:51,270
It screws me over.

4412
03:31:03,220 --> 03:31:05,360
Now how does this help me?

4413
03:31:06,240 --> 03:31:07,480
Is there something underneath?

4414
03:31:07,860 --> 03:31:08,300
No?

4415
03:31:09,800 --> 03:31:10,280
Hey!

4416
03:31:10,620 --> 03:31:10,720
Oh!

4417
03:31:10,940 --> 03:31:11,280
Oh!

4418
03:31:11,340 --> 03:31:11,880
Oh, we can jump!

4419
03:31:12,100 --> 03:31:12,340
Oh!

4420
03:31:12,620 --> 03:31:13,040
Okay, hold on.

4421
03:31:13,300 --> 03:31:15,260
I'm just looking around if there's anything else.

4422
03:31:17,060 --> 03:31:17,540
Um...

4423
03:31:19,180 --> 03:31:20,580
I want to break boxes.

4424
03:31:21,940 --> 03:31:22,860
But I'll refuse.

4425
03:31:23,280 --> 03:31:24,320
Oh my gosh, I almost...

4426
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:25,980
I almost just...

4427
03:31:25,980 --> 03:31:27,180
I almost just...

4428
03:31:41,370 --> 03:31:42,290
How tall...

4429
03:31:42,290 --> 03:31:42,890
Am I?

4430
03:32:05,980 --> 03:32:10,500
I really hope there was nothing else in here that I needed because, uh...

4431
03:32:10,500 --> 03:32:11,200
Sayonara!

4432
03:32:14,730 --> 03:32:17,550
Breaking boxes betrays you.

4433
03:32:19,110 --> 03:32:20,210
What is that?

4434
03:32:21,750 --> 03:32:22,510
Oh!

4435
03:32:22,870 --> 03:32:23,270
Oh!

4436
03:32:24,690 --> 03:32:25,910
What is this?

4437
03:32:27,890 --> 03:32:29,010
The bees!

4438
03:32:34,410 --> 03:32:35,610
It's the bees!

4439
03:32:39,930 --> 03:32:40,330
Please!

4440
03:32:40,330 --> 03:32:41,050
I wish I could...

4441
03:32:41,050 --> 03:32:41,910
Please give me armor.

4442
03:32:44,610 --> 03:32:45,450
Oh, I'll take that.

4443
03:32:45,630 --> 03:32:46,510
Let's definitely take that.

4444
03:32:51,410 --> 03:32:52,290
I'll take that.

4445
03:32:53,890 --> 03:32:54,290
Okay.

4446
03:32:56,230 --> 03:32:57,070
Save and test?

4447
03:32:57,210 --> 03:32:58,150
Yeah, let's try it out.

4448
03:32:58,530 --> 03:32:59,050
Oh my god.

4449
03:32:59,670 --> 03:33:00,430
So what do I do?

4450
03:33:01,530 --> 03:33:03,350
Watch it with that thing.

4451
03:33:03,510 --> 03:33:04,490
Oh, Barty!

4452
03:33:04,650 --> 03:33:05,590
I'm so sorry!

4453
03:33:07,490 --> 03:33:08,250
Barty!

4454
03:33:19,080 --> 03:33:20,220
I'm sorry.

4455
03:33:24,000 --> 03:33:25,660
Be so nice.

4456
03:33:39,950 --> 03:33:40,690
Just kill me.

4457
03:33:48,270 --> 03:33:49,030
Anyway.

4458
03:33:49,470 --> 03:33:49,950
Oh my god!

4459
03:33:50,650 --> 03:33:51,410
Sorry.

4460
03:33:51,790 --> 03:33:51,910
Okay.

4461
03:33:52,550 --> 03:33:53,070
Restart.

4462
03:33:57,280 --> 03:33:57,800
Restart.

4463
03:34:04,490 --> 03:34:05,650
I can't un...

4464
03:34:06,710 --> 03:34:07,230
Hi.

4465
03:34:08,370 --> 03:34:09,190
Hi, Gordon.

4466
03:34:09,570 --> 03:34:09,830
Hi.

4467
03:34:10,930 --> 03:34:11,650
Oh my god.

4468
03:34:12,650 --> 03:34:13,510
Take cover!

4469
03:34:15,290 --> 03:34:16,390
Yeah, you sure did.

4470
03:34:17,490 --> 03:34:18,010
Okay.

4471
03:34:18,170 --> 03:34:19,010
You also...

4472
03:34:19,010 --> 03:34:19,670
Here, come here.

4473
03:34:20,130 --> 03:34:20,590
Come here.

4474
03:34:20,670 --> 03:34:21,070
Use that.

4475
03:34:21,410 --> 03:34:22,510
Walk on top of it.

4476
03:34:22,610 --> 03:34:23,170
The pain.

4477
03:34:23,470 --> 03:34:24,610
Come here.

4478
03:34:24,710 --> 03:34:24,930
Come here.

4479
03:34:27,610 --> 03:34:28,230
Use it.

4480
03:34:28,390 --> 03:34:28,750
Eat it.

4481
03:34:29,230 --> 03:34:30,690
I'll stay here and guard this area.

4482
03:34:30,790 --> 03:34:31,450
You should do that.

4483
03:34:31,590 --> 03:34:31,690
Yeah.

4484
03:34:33,670 --> 03:34:34,430
Oh my gosh.

4485
03:34:34,610 --> 03:34:34,970
You know what?

4486
03:34:35,070 --> 03:34:35,670
We've got...

4487
03:34:35,670 --> 03:34:36,870
Well, I have 48.

4488
03:34:37,130 --> 03:34:37,870
Let's try this out.

4489
03:34:38,070 --> 03:34:38,210
Okay.

4490
03:34:38,710 --> 03:34:39,010
Alright.

4491
03:34:47,730 --> 03:34:48,130
Maybe...

4492
03:34:48,130 --> 03:34:49,790
Maybe it's not as great as I thought it.

4493
03:34:51,870 --> 03:34:52,270
Maybe...

4494
03:34:53,550 --> 03:34:54,530
Use the bees.

4495
03:34:54,530 --> 03:34:54,830
Bees.

4496
03:34:54,950 --> 03:34:55,710
My party.

4497
03:34:56,970 --> 03:34:58,110
I'm traumatized now.

4498
03:34:59,450 --> 03:34:59,810
Okay.

4499
03:34:59,870 --> 03:35:00,110
Hold on.

4500
03:35:00,170 --> 03:35:00,730
I'll use the bees.

4501
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:08,920
It's not as exciting as I thought it would be.

4502
03:35:18,120 --> 03:35:19,660
It's kind of not great.

4503
03:35:19,800 --> 03:35:19,980
Hold on.

4504
03:35:20,060 --> 03:35:20,480
Let's try again.

4505
03:35:24,160 --> 03:35:24,520
Oops.

4506
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:26,040
My bad.

4507
03:35:26,180 --> 03:35:26,360
Hold on.

4508
03:35:26,360 --> 03:35:26,780
Sorry.

4509
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:27,580
Wrong weapon.

4510
03:35:27,940 --> 03:35:28,060
Okay.

4511
03:35:28,180 --> 03:35:28,280
Okay.

4512
03:35:28,500 --> 03:35:28,960
One more time.

4513
03:35:31,720 --> 03:35:33,040
I'm spamming bees!

4514
03:35:36,040 --> 03:35:38,600
I feel like I took so much...

4515
03:35:39,280 --> 03:35:40,220
Spam is infinite.

4516
03:35:40,480 --> 03:35:41,160
It is?

4517
03:35:41,300 --> 03:35:41,600
Okay.

4518
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:42,300
I...

4519
03:35:43,200 --> 03:35:44,520
It's kind of...

4520
03:35:44,520 --> 03:35:44,720
Bad.

4521
03:35:47,800 --> 03:35:49,740
The bees don't do much damage.

4522
03:35:49,740 --> 03:35:50,620
Except it's me.

4523
03:35:50,720 --> 03:35:51,620
If it's me, I guess.

4524
03:35:56,860 --> 03:35:57,300
Uh...

4525
03:35:58,860 --> 03:35:59,300
Okay.

4526
03:35:59,460 --> 03:35:59,920
Well, hold on.

4527
03:36:00,360 --> 03:36:00,640
Wait.

4528
03:36:00,720 --> 03:36:01,380
Did I save already?

4529
03:36:01,700 --> 03:36:02,060
Okay.

4530
03:36:02,140 --> 03:36:02,440
No, no, no.

4531
03:36:02,560 --> 03:36:02,720
Okay.

4532
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:03,020
Hold on.

4533
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:04,120
Give me a second.

4534
03:36:04,440 --> 03:36:05,200
Give me a second.

4535
03:36:05,540 --> 03:36:06,800
Barney, don't get hit.

4536
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:07,680
Damn it!

4537
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:09,720
Don't get hit, Barney!

4538
03:36:10,840 --> 03:36:11,320
Oh.

4539
03:36:11,720 --> 03:36:12,700
Why did I do that?

4540
03:36:12,880 --> 03:36:13,060
Sorry.

4541
03:36:13,340 --> 03:36:13,880
I'm silly.

4542
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:14,840
Okay.

4543
03:36:18,400 --> 03:36:18,880
Okay.

4544
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:20,220
Now we're good.

4545
03:36:20,400 --> 03:36:21,240
Now we're good to go.

4546
03:36:21,460 --> 03:36:22,420
Now we're all fine.

4547
03:36:23,920 --> 03:36:25,980
I never used the bee gun myself.

4548
03:36:25,980 --> 03:36:29,260
I feel like maybe if you know how to use it, it's fine.

4549
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:32,660
I don't think I do.

4550
03:37:03,620 --> 03:37:04,520
I'm trying.

4551
03:37:07,080 --> 03:37:07,620
Okay.

4552
03:37:07,700 --> 03:37:08,060
There we go.

4553
03:37:08,220 --> 03:37:08,760
I tried.

4554
03:37:09,860 --> 03:37:11,560
I still got shot though.

4555
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:13,180
Nothing in here.

4556
03:37:14,260 --> 03:37:14,680
Uh oh.

4557
03:37:14,800 --> 03:37:16,080
Someone did not make it.

4558
03:37:16,640 --> 03:37:20,020
I think the people that were shooting did the losing.

4559
03:37:27,560 --> 03:37:28,680
Barney, you okay?

4560
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:33,120
There's still critters around?

4561
03:37:44,940 --> 03:37:46,160
What's in there?

4562
03:37:49,820 --> 03:37:51,120
What's in there?

4563
03:37:53,900 --> 03:37:54,700
Nothing?

4564
03:37:56,120 --> 03:37:56,920
Huh.

4565
03:37:57,480 --> 03:37:58,320
Just a box.

4566
03:37:59,260 --> 03:38:00,240
Huh, just a box.

4567
03:38:05,280 --> 03:38:06,860
There's a lot going on up here.

4568
03:38:13,300 --> 03:38:14,120
Oh my god.

4569
03:38:16,320 --> 03:38:16,800
Ow!

4570
03:38:16,960 --> 03:38:17,520
The bees!

4571
03:38:22,780 --> 03:38:23,260
Fuck.

4572
03:38:23,640 --> 03:38:23,740
Oh.

4573
03:38:24,080 --> 03:38:24,280
Oh.

4574
03:38:25,060 --> 03:38:26,140
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4575
03:38:26,300 --> 03:38:26,400
Okay.

4576
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:27,820
I got...

4577
03:38:28,260 --> 03:38:28,500
Understood.

4578
03:38:35,240 --> 03:38:35,720
Oops.

4579
03:38:36,360 --> 03:38:36,780
Okay.

4580
03:38:37,800 --> 03:38:38,320
Um...

4581
03:38:38,320 --> 03:38:39,240
Uh...

4582
03:38:40,120 --> 03:38:40,640
Uh...

4583
03:38:40,640 --> 03:38:40,900
Uh...

4584
03:38:41,400 --> 03:38:41,540
Uh...

4585
03:38:41,540 --> 03:38:42,000
Uh...

4586
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:44,240
Airstrike on the way.

4587
03:38:44,380 --> 03:38:48,000
Yeah, why can't it also destroy, like, the guys that are...

4588
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:48,920
...around here?

4589
03:38:57,310 --> 03:38:59,310
What the hell is that making that sound?

4590
03:39:02,890 --> 03:39:04,410
What is making that sound?

4591
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:11,260
What's making that sound?

4592
03:39:11,520 --> 03:39:11,740
Oh.

4593
03:39:12,520 --> 03:39:13,020
Oh,

4594
03:39:17,260 --> 03:39:17,340
dude.

4595
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:18,680
I'm shooting the ground.

4596
03:39:24,440 --> 03:39:24,960
Um...

4597
03:39:24,960 --> 03:39:25,120
What?

4598
03:39:25,560 --> 03:39:25,700
What?

4599
03:39:25,980 --> 03:39:26,280
Oh, I...

4600
03:39:26,280 --> 03:39:27,020
Okay, okay, okay.

4601
03:39:27,120 --> 03:39:27,340
I see.

4602
03:39:29,280 --> 03:39:30,160
What the?

4603
03:39:51,460 --> 03:39:53,360
Yeah, there's a lot going on here.

4604
03:39:53,680 --> 03:39:54,060
I...

4605
03:39:54,060 --> 03:39:54,560
I...

4606
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:55,300
Sorry, you guys.

4607
03:39:55,560 --> 03:39:55,860
I'm...

4608
03:39:57,500 --> 03:39:58,540
I'm extremely...

4609
03:39:59,400 --> 03:40:00,860
...brain foggy today.

4610
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:02,260
Please understand.

4611
03:40:02,740 --> 03:40:03,180
Oh my gosh.

4612
03:40:03,400 --> 03:40:04,020
Oh my god.

4613
03:40:04,020 --> 03:40:04,440
Oh my god.

4614
03:40:27,490 --> 03:40:28,950
Sounds so stinky.

4615
03:40:38,710 --> 03:40:39,990
Someone said that the...

4616
03:40:40,430 --> 03:40:41,290
...bees regenerate?

4617
03:40:41,690 --> 03:40:42,450
So, bye.

4618
03:40:44,490 --> 03:40:45,750
Oh, there they go.

4619
03:40:46,570 --> 03:40:47,230
Oh, they're...

4620
03:40:47,230 --> 03:40:48,070
Yeah, they do regenerate.

4621
03:40:48,210 --> 03:40:48,330
Okay.

4622
03:40:48,330 --> 03:40:48,350
Okay.

4623
03:40:51,750 --> 03:40:53,410
But they're not omen.

4624
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:09,680
But they're not omen.

4625
03:41:09,780 --> 03:41:10,620
Oh!

4626
03:41:18,620 --> 03:41:20,080
Oh, something's getting done.

4627
03:41:26,620 --> 03:41:29,520
Hopefully these guys don't just, uh, respawn.

4628
03:41:31,820 --> 03:41:33,020
Oh my god.

4629
03:41:33,740 --> 03:41:34,680
How does he...

4630
03:41:34,680 --> 03:41:35,600
How does he respawn?

4631
03:41:35,980 --> 03:41:36,940
Oh, there's some health.

4632
03:41:38,060 --> 03:41:38,880
Oh, my goodness.

4633
03:41:38,960 --> 03:41:39,340
Thank goodness.

4634
03:41:40,460 --> 03:41:41,060
Oh.

4635
03:41:41,680 --> 03:41:42,220
Thank goodness.

4636
03:41:42,820 --> 03:41:43,120
Ah!

4637
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:45,940
30% Okay.

4638
03:41:46,300 --> 03:41:46,820
Awesome.

4639
03:41:48,960 --> 03:41:49,680
Okay.

4640
03:41:53,800 --> 03:41:55,400
I'm gonna turn this off.

4641
03:41:56,540 --> 03:41:57,260
Save.

4642
03:41:57,540 --> 03:41:58,340
I just did, did I not?

4643
03:42:11,500 --> 03:42:12,920
Oh, he almost got stuck.

4644
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:16,060
Ah!

4645
03:42:21,890 --> 03:42:22,610
Ouch.

4646
03:42:28,020 --> 03:42:29,640
Oh, a fracture?

4647
03:42:29,960 --> 03:42:30,400
Come on.

4648
03:42:33,480 --> 03:42:33,960
Eek!

4649
03:42:34,240 --> 03:42:34,400
Eek!

4650
03:42:36,080 --> 03:42:36,560
Ah!

4651
03:42:51,660 --> 03:42:52,580
We got him.

4652
03:42:52,720 --> 03:42:52,980
Wow.

4653
03:42:53,220 --> 03:42:53,460
Okay.

4654
03:42:53,760 --> 03:42:55,560
Oh, my very last one even.

4655
03:42:56,660 --> 03:42:58,020
I don't know if I'll keep...

4656
03:42:58,020 --> 03:42:58,100
Wait.

4657
03:42:58,240 --> 03:43:00,160
Did I get all the health that was around here?

4658
03:43:00,480 --> 03:43:01,280
Yeah, I did.

4659
03:43:02,060 --> 03:43:02,480
Ah!

4660
03:43:03,000 --> 03:43:03,920
Okay, sorry guys.

4661
03:43:04,060 --> 03:43:04,820
I'm gonna redo it.

4662
03:43:05,320 --> 03:43:06,680
I'm gonna redo it!

4663
03:43:07,420 --> 03:43:07,900
Because...

4664
03:43:07,900 --> 03:43:09,200
I don't wanna...

4665
03:43:09,200 --> 03:43:10,480
...die to a fracture.

4666
03:43:13,020 --> 03:43:14,740
I don't wanna die to a fracture.

4667
03:43:30,970 --> 03:43:31,910
Oh, my gosh.

4668
03:43:32,090 --> 03:43:32,510
It's so...

4669
03:43:32,510 --> 03:43:33,750
I keep tripping on it.

4670
03:43:34,230 --> 03:43:35,390
Oh, we got it though.

4671
03:43:35,610 --> 03:43:35,810
Okay.

4672
03:43:36,130 --> 03:43:38,030
I guess, um...

4673
03:43:38,830 --> 03:43:39,950
We take these.

4674
03:43:44,270 --> 03:43:45,350
We take these.

4675
03:43:51,540 --> 03:43:53,480
Who is dying over here?

4676
03:43:59,410 --> 03:43:59,770
Oh!

4677
03:44:00,050 --> 03:44:00,410
Oh!

4678
03:44:00,630 --> 03:44:00,990
Oh!

4679
03:44:01,030 --> 03:44:01,190
Oh, my God.

4680
03:44:01,270 --> 03:44:01,670
The sniper.

4681
03:44:04,210 --> 03:44:05,250
Seek a medical...

4682
03:44:06,270 --> 03:44:07,450
Seek a medical...

4683
03:44:07,450 --> 03:44:07,610
Oh!

4684
03:44:09,250 --> 03:44:09,610
Ha!

4685
03:44:09,950 --> 03:44:10,310
Ha!

4686
03:44:10,310 --> 03:44:10,590
Ha!

4687
03:44:10,630 --> 03:44:10,750
Ha!

4688
03:44:10,870 --> 03:44:11,190
Ha!

4689
03:44:11,370 --> 03:44:11,390
Ha!

4690
03:44:12,390 --> 03:44:12,750
Okay.

4691
03:44:13,230 --> 03:44:13,590
Nice.

4692
03:44:13,870 --> 03:44:13,970
Okay.

4693
03:44:14,210 --> 03:44:14,730
Uh, nice.

4694
03:44:15,010 --> 03:44:15,430
Okay, nice.

4695
03:44:18,810 --> 03:44:20,370
Watch out for the sniper, by the way.

4696
03:44:20,490 --> 03:44:20,810
Oh, thanks.

4697
03:44:21,510 --> 03:44:21,870
Yeah.

4698
03:44:26,240 --> 03:44:27,160
Got his ass.

4699
03:44:27,360 --> 03:44:28,360
Oh, I did not mean to save.

4700
03:44:28,740 --> 03:44:28,920
Oops.

4701
03:44:35,780 --> 03:44:36,420
Who's shooting?

4702
03:44:44,460 --> 03:44:45,160
Oh, well.

4703
03:44:45,420 --> 03:44:46,440
I guess, uh...

4704
03:44:53,830 --> 03:44:54,290
He's...

4705
03:44:54,290 --> 03:44:54,750
He's gone.

4706
03:44:56,090 --> 03:44:57,110
My man left.

4707
03:44:57,470 --> 03:44:58,670
But he really did leave.

4708
03:44:59,170 --> 03:45:00,150
Are you coming back?

4709
03:45:00,330 --> 03:45:00,450
Are you coming back?

4710
03:45:01,210 --> 03:45:01,570
Or...

4711
03:45:02,450 --> 03:45:02,810
Uh...

4712
03:45:11,850 --> 03:45:12,710
He got me good.

4713
03:45:13,070 --> 03:45:13,390
I'll be...

4714
03:45:13,390 --> 03:45:13,950
I'll give him that.

4715
03:45:14,650 --> 03:45:15,550
He got me good.

4716
03:45:15,750 --> 03:45:16,550
I'll give him that.

4717
03:45:28,150 --> 03:45:28,510
Ow!

4718
03:45:28,630 --> 03:45:29,910
I keep forgetting to reload.

4719
03:45:30,210 --> 03:45:30,370
Okay.

4720
03:45:30,530 --> 03:45:31,530
Let me reload real quick.

4721
03:45:31,630 --> 03:45:33,130
Before I freaking...

4722
03:45:33,130 --> 03:45:33,990
Okay, there we go.

4723
03:45:34,230 --> 03:45:34,510
All right.

4724
03:45:34,650 --> 03:45:35,090
My bad.

4725
03:45:35,090 --> 03:45:35,690
My bad.

4726
03:45:35,690 --> 03:45:36,070
My bad.

4727
03:45:36,070 --> 03:45:36,130
My bad.

4728
03:45:36,210 --> 03:45:36,610
My bad.

4729
03:45:36,750 --> 03:45:37,070
My bad.

4730
03:45:37,070 --> 03:45:37,190
My bad.

4731
03:45:37,990 --> 03:45:40,090
I don't even know if that was doing anything to anybody.

4732
03:45:43,830 --> 03:45:45,070
Oh, I have no more grenades.

4733
03:45:59,300 --> 03:46:00,200
Trip mine.

4734
03:46:01,040 --> 03:46:01,700
Where at?

4735
03:46:05,380 --> 03:46:06,260
Where at?

4736
03:46:07,360 --> 03:46:08,440
The side eye.

4737
03:46:12,710 --> 03:46:14,910
What is this thing making the sound?

4738
03:46:15,430 --> 03:46:16,830
I don't like it.

4739
03:46:20,370 --> 03:46:20,910
Uh...

4740
03:46:23,700 --> 03:46:24,240
Yeah.

4741
03:46:24,580 --> 03:46:24,920
Shut up.

4742
03:46:29,710 --> 03:46:30,250
Nice.

4743
03:46:35,330 --> 03:46:36,510
Your friend upstairs?

4744
03:46:36,790 --> 03:46:37,270
Must be.

4745
03:46:40,750 --> 03:46:41,990
Guess we'll go meet him.

4746
03:46:43,470 --> 03:46:43,710
Get

4747
03:46:55,830 --> 03:46:56,350
over there!

4748
03:46:59,910 --> 03:47:00,450
Barn.

4749
03:47:00,650 --> 03:47:01,130
Barn, barn.

4750
03:47:06,490 --> 03:47:07,470
That was sick.

4751
03:47:07,570 --> 03:47:07,890
Thank you.

4752
03:47:09,150 --> 03:47:09,690
Hey.

4753
03:47:11,550 --> 03:47:11,770
Huh!

4754
03:47:12,210 --> 03:47:12,890
He won't even talk.

4755
03:47:13,390 --> 03:47:14,250
What did you say?

4756
03:47:15,570 --> 03:47:16,570
Don't go in there.

4757
03:47:17,230 --> 03:47:17,670
Oh, okay.

4758
03:47:17,970 --> 03:47:19,210
Oh, I need you to go...

4759
03:47:19,210 --> 03:47:19,430
Okay.

4760
03:47:22,970 --> 03:47:23,570
Don't...

4761
03:47:23,570 --> 03:47:24,010
Don't...

4762
03:47:24,550 --> 03:47:25,530
You're scaring me!

4763
03:47:29,310 --> 03:47:29,910
Oh!

4764
03:47:30,310 --> 03:47:30,910
Nice!

4765
03:47:32,490 --> 03:47:33,090
Uh...

4766
03:47:33,890 --> 03:47:34,490
Oh!

4767
03:47:35,870 --> 03:47:36,790
Oh my god.

4768
03:47:37,330 --> 03:47:37,810
Oh!

4769
03:47:39,250 --> 03:47:39,850
Oh!

4770
03:47:40,110 --> 03:47:40,250
Oh!

4771
03:47:41,070 --> 03:47:41,670
Oh!

4772
03:47:41,670 --> 03:47:41,850
Oh!

4773
03:47:44,870 --> 03:47:45,630
Oh!

4774
03:47:46,850 --> 03:47:47,490
Oh!

4775
03:47:50,830 --> 03:47:52,230
I wish they gave me...

4776
03:47:52,230 --> 03:47:53,310
They gave me everything but...

4777
03:47:53,310 --> 03:47:53,590
Help!

4778
03:47:54,290 --> 03:47:55,230
Just kidding!

4779
03:47:56,870 --> 03:47:57,810
Uh-oh.

4780
03:47:59,030 --> 03:47:59,490
Why?

4781
03:48:00,470 --> 03:48:01,770
Lock and load.

4782
03:48:03,770 --> 03:48:05,870
Wait, why'd they give me help?

4783
03:48:06,550 --> 03:48:07,510
Oh, I'm scared.

4784
03:48:08,490 --> 03:48:09,850
Let's get the hell out of here.

4785
03:48:10,050 --> 03:48:10,150
No.

4786
03:48:10,530 --> 03:48:11,610
Okay, I'll secure this area.

4787
03:48:11,750 --> 03:48:12,310
Yeah, exactly.

4788
03:48:12,630 --> 03:48:14,510
You stay right...

4789
03:48:15,470 --> 03:48:17,150
Where you are, buddy boy.

4790
03:48:18,510 --> 03:48:19,330
Okay, never mind.

4791
03:48:19,970 --> 03:48:20,230
Okay.

4792
03:48:22,270 --> 03:48:23,230
Alright, what do I...

4793
03:48:24,990 --> 03:48:27,450
There's so much going on at all times right now.

4794
03:48:29,750 --> 03:48:30,310
Okay.

4795
03:48:32,570 --> 03:48:33,130
Um...

4796
03:48:34,190 --> 03:48:34,750
I...

4797
03:48:34,750 --> 03:48:35,710
Can't go this way.

4798
03:48:35,970 --> 03:48:37,050
So we'll go...

4799
03:48:37,050 --> 03:48:37,670
This way.

4800
03:48:40,890 --> 03:48:41,450
Um...

4801
03:48:41,450 --> 03:48:42,910
Can I climb up this?

4802
03:48:47,550 --> 03:48:48,690
There's something in there.

4803
03:48:48,770 --> 03:48:49,270
I don't know...

4804
03:48:49,270 --> 03:48:50,410
I don't want to open that door.

4805
03:48:54,950 --> 03:48:55,510
Uh...

4806
03:49:07,020 --> 03:49:08,280
Is there anything in here?

4807
03:49:08,580 --> 03:49:09,020
No.

4808
03:49:14,320 --> 03:49:15,300
Window upstairs.

4809
03:49:18,940 --> 03:49:19,460
Okay.

4810
03:49:19,460 --> 03:49:20,580
Can I jump from this window?

4811
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:22,060
Okay, okay.

4812
03:49:26,180 --> 03:49:27,000
Over here.

4813
03:49:27,940 --> 03:49:28,080
Hi.

4814
03:49:28,700 --> 03:49:29,220
Hooray.

4815
03:49:29,700 --> 03:49:30,220
Hooray.

4816
03:49:30,840 --> 03:49:31,360
Okay.

4817
03:49:34,320 --> 03:49:35,800
Oh, I always think it's at me.

4818
03:49:36,440 --> 03:49:37,380
Oh, gosh, okay.

4819
03:49:44,920 --> 03:49:45,700
Ah, hi.

4820
03:49:46,020 --> 03:49:46,420
I see, I see.

4821
03:49:47,560 --> 03:49:48,580
Oh, ho, ho.

4822
03:49:49,100 --> 03:49:49,640
Wa-boo!

4823
03:49:49,640 --> 03:49:50,640
Woo-hoo!

4824
03:50:00,800 --> 03:50:02,640
I came too hard.

4825
03:50:02,860 --> 03:50:03,800
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

4826
03:50:04,320 --> 03:50:06,600
I came too hard!

4827
03:50:26,520 --> 03:50:29,540
Oh, can I destroy their satellite system?

4828
03:50:33,160 --> 03:50:35,800
Oh, boy.

4829
03:50:36,060 --> 03:50:36,240
Okay.

4830
03:50:36,940 --> 03:50:37,720
Oh, boy.

4831
03:50:37,960 --> 03:50:38,080
Okay.

4832
03:50:41,260 --> 03:50:42,560
Maybe I shouldn't have saved.

4833
03:50:42,840 --> 03:50:43,980
I messed up.

4834
03:50:44,140 --> 03:50:44,400
Hold on.

4835
03:50:57,490 --> 03:50:58,850
I think I messed up.

4836
03:50:59,210 --> 03:51:00,350
The bees, the bees.

4837
03:51:05,350 --> 03:51:05,930
Scones.

4838
03:51:14,290 --> 03:51:15,770
Are the bees doing anything?

4839
03:51:22,980 --> 03:51:23,940
You know what?

4840
03:51:23,940 --> 03:51:25,060
I also have grenades now.

4841
03:51:25,240 --> 03:51:25,620
What am I doing?

4842
03:51:26,660 --> 03:51:27,200
Oh, my God.

4843
03:51:28,580 --> 03:51:28,980
Ouch.

4844
03:51:30,280 --> 03:51:30,620
Ouch.

4845
03:51:32,600 --> 03:51:33,000
Everywhere.

4846
03:51:36,000 --> 03:51:36,660
Oh, my God.

4847
03:51:36,740 --> 03:51:37,720
It's just a grenade war.

4848
03:51:43,840 --> 03:51:46,580
Why did I... What the... Oh, because I... Oh, my gosh.

4849
03:51:46,720 --> 03:51:46,820
Okay.

4850
03:51:55,010 --> 03:51:56,090
Did I take that hit?

4851
03:51:56,530 --> 03:51:57,350
I must have.

4852
03:51:57,610 --> 03:51:58,090
Wait, hold on.

4853
03:51:58,890 --> 03:51:59,650
No, I didn't.

4854
03:52:00,770 --> 03:52:01,450
I'm losing.

4855
03:52:01,870 --> 03:52:02,210
Wait.

4856
03:52:03,590 --> 03:52:03,990
Or...

4857
03:52:04,870 --> 03:52:06,130
The... It changed.

4858
03:52:06,270 --> 03:52:07,550
It was 54 before... Oh, wait.

4859
03:52:07,690 --> 03:52:08,130
I'm stupid.

4860
03:52:08,350 --> 03:52:08,970
Why did I do that?

4861
03:52:12,190 --> 03:52:13,630
What if I... Okay, hold on.

4862
03:52:15,870 --> 03:52:16,670
Okay, hold on.

4863
03:52:16,810 --> 03:52:17,770
Let me...

4864
03:52:31,610 --> 03:52:34,150
I don't think there's as many guys down here that I think there are.

4865
03:52:39,670 --> 03:52:40,390
Worms gameplay.

4866
03:52:42,830 --> 03:52:44,250
The visible planes.

4867
03:52:46,530 --> 03:52:48,290
The better bee-siness bureau.

4868
03:52:48,790 --> 03:52:50,390
You know there's a lot of buzz around our bees.

4869
03:52:50,750 --> 03:52:51,650
So we're sorry.

4870
03:52:51,890 --> 03:52:54,070
They were below your expectations.

4871
03:52:54,830 --> 03:52:56,910
Can we make it up with some freebies?

4872
03:52:57,770 --> 03:52:58,130
Yeah.

4873
03:52:58,870 --> 03:53:00,810
It is pretty disappointing.

4874
03:53:00,810 --> 03:53:01,670
I'm not gonna lie.

4875
03:53:03,230 --> 03:53:06,130
Like, I really did think that there would be...

4876
03:53:06,670 --> 03:53:08,810
A little more oomph to these bees.

4877
03:53:09,310 --> 03:53:10,710
I mean, they're like...

4878
03:53:11,210 --> 03:53:11,950
Supposed to...

4879
03:53:11,950 --> 03:53:13,310
You advertise as the...

4880
03:53:14,030 --> 03:53:16,390
You advertise as the bees' knees.

4881
03:53:19,450 --> 03:53:22,030
And that just doesn't seem to be the case.

4882
03:53:22,650 --> 03:53:24,830
It's just really not holding up to...

4883
03:53:24,830 --> 03:53:26,010
The expectations.

4884
03:53:26,630 --> 03:53:27,530
To the...

4885
03:53:27,530 --> 03:53:28,270
To the...

4886
03:53:28,270 --> 03:53:28,910
You know...

4887
03:53:31,150 --> 03:53:32,970
What we all had...

4888
03:53:32,970 --> 03:53:35,450
In mind...

4889
03:53:35,450 --> 03:53:36,390
Did I...

4890
03:53:36,390 --> 03:53:37,630
I think we're okay.

4891
03:53:38,830 --> 03:53:39,230
Oh!

4892
03:53:42,820 --> 03:53:43,880
On a...

4893
03:53:43,880 --> 03:53:44,400
Scale?

4894
03:53:46,900 --> 03:53:47,460
Like...

4895
03:53:47,460 --> 03:53:48,500
Scale?

4896
03:53:49,120 --> 03:53:50,580
Like a grading scale?

4897
03:53:50,780 --> 03:53:51,920
I wouldn't even give them a bee.

4898
03:53:52,620 --> 03:53:53,120
You know?

4899
03:53:53,380 --> 03:53:54,760
It's just that...

4900
03:54:02,670 --> 03:54:03,630
This is scary.

4901
03:54:03,910 --> 03:54:04,110
Oh!

4902
03:54:12,390 --> 03:54:13,570
Wait, this is scary.

4903
03:54:15,190 --> 03:54:16,250
Where am I supposed to go?

4904
03:54:16,750 --> 03:54:17,710
Maybe back up?

4905
03:54:22,060 --> 03:54:22,580
Uh...

4906
03:54:22,580 --> 03:54:23,320
Can I go back up?

4907
03:54:23,400 --> 03:54:23,660
Yes.

4908
03:54:24,540 --> 03:54:26,800
I can't believe it.

4909
03:54:31,610 --> 03:54:32,510
Parkour time.

4910
03:54:32,810 --> 03:54:33,930
But to where?

4911
03:54:34,310 --> 03:54:34,650
Oh!

4912
03:54:34,790 --> 03:54:35,850
I need to go to that floor.

4913
03:54:35,970 --> 03:54:36,550
Okay, I see it.

4914
03:54:37,790 --> 03:54:38,310
Oh.

4915
03:54:42,750 --> 03:54:43,790
Ah-ha.

4916
03:54:44,350 --> 03:54:44,570
Okay.

4917
03:54:44,750 --> 03:54:46,990
Saved where I initially wanted to.

4918
03:54:46,990 --> 03:54:48,590
Okay, okay, okay.

4919
03:54:50,790 --> 03:54:51,410
Uh...

4920
03:54:51,410 --> 03:54:52,490
Can I even make this?

4921
03:54:58,830 --> 03:54:59,450
Wow!

4922
03:54:59,910 --> 03:55:00,730
I did it!

4923
03:55:01,230 --> 03:55:01,690
Wow!

4924
03:55:03,890 --> 03:55:04,710
Uh-oh.

4925
03:55:06,830 --> 03:55:07,450
Uh...

4926
03:55:10,800 --> 03:55:12,800
I've trained in Minecraft for this.

4927
03:55:23,380 --> 03:55:24,760
Let's just see what's gonna happen.

4928
03:55:41,370 --> 03:55:42,570
Pain ahead?

4929
03:55:42,890 --> 03:55:43,510
No way.

4930
03:55:44,590 --> 03:55:45,990
Shoot the rotors.

4931
03:55:46,330 --> 03:55:47,130
Oh, okay, okay.

4932
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:53,780
Oh!

4933
03:56:08,080 --> 03:56:09,560
Pain for them, maybe.

4934
03:56:11,980 --> 03:56:13,720
Pain for them, maybe.

4935
03:56:15,640 --> 03:56:16,500
And me.

4936
03:56:18,200 --> 03:56:18,680
My

4937
03:56:23,700 --> 03:56:23,920
bad.

4938
03:56:27,400 --> 03:56:28,140
My bad.

4939
03:56:29,380 --> 03:56:30,840
I need to prepare for them.

4940
03:56:42,480 --> 03:56:43,180
No fish!

4941
03:56:57,130 --> 03:56:58,510
Ah, I'm wasting them.

4942
03:57:02,390 --> 03:57:03,490
Aim at the floor.

4943
03:57:03,730 --> 03:57:04,610
Oh, that would have been better, huh?

4944
03:57:04,610 --> 03:57:04,610
No.

4945
03:57:07,290 --> 03:57:07,870
Ugh.

4946
03:57:08,850 --> 03:57:09,630
VTuber, please.

4947
03:57:10,550 --> 03:57:11,130
Hey!

4948
03:57:11,710 --> 03:57:13,630
Um, I don't know.

4949
03:57:14,550 --> 03:57:15,390
You know what?

4950
03:57:15,530 --> 03:57:16,070
Let's do it again.

4951
03:57:16,990 --> 03:57:18,030
Let's do it.

4952
03:57:18,150 --> 03:57:19,090
Let me try it.

4953
03:57:19,170 --> 03:57:20,090
Maybe with grenades instead.

4954
03:57:23,690 --> 03:57:24,270
Hoey!

4955
03:57:27,750 --> 03:57:28,330
Oh.

4956
03:57:28,850 --> 03:57:29,430
Hoey!

4957
03:57:30,670 --> 03:57:31,250
Oh.

4958
03:57:32,070 --> 03:57:33,590
Okay, not with grenades.

4959
03:57:33,850 --> 03:57:34,270
Okay, hold on.

4960
03:57:34,310 --> 03:57:34,810
They're too bouncy.

4961
03:57:36,830 --> 03:57:39,010
Um, shoddy.

4962
03:57:54,630 --> 03:57:56,290
Crossbow, I have limited.

4963
03:57:56,970 --> 03:57:58,710
I only have...how much do I have?

4964
03:57:58,990 --> 03:58:00,090
I only have 20!

4965
03:58:01,590 --> 03:58:02,670
This works!

4966
03:58:05,330 --> 03:58:06,050
Okay.

4967
03:58:07,050 --> 03:58:08,110
We saved.

4968
03:58:08,430 --> 03:58:10,490
We should be okay for now.

4969
03:58:11,510 --> 03:58:13,290
They're not as tough as they look.

4970
03:58:14,890 --> 03:58:16,130
That concerns me.

4971
03:58:16,650 --> 03:58:17,590
A little bit.

4972
03:58:19,370 --> 03:58:21,050
That...that concerns me a little bit.

4973
03:58:21,230 --> 03:58:23,230
Wait, I wish I could blow...can I blow that up early?

4974
03:58:24,110 --> 03:58:24,750
Let's chip.

4975
03:58:24,890 --> 03:58:25,250
Let's try.

4976
03:58:31,470 --> 03:58:32,790
I can use it.

4977
03:58:32,990 --> 03:58:33,150
Oh.

4978
03:58:33,750 --> 03:58:34,530
That's exciting.

4979
03:58:34,650 --> 03:58:35,670
That doesn't concern me.

4980
03:58:35,670 --> 03:58:36,470
That excites me.

4981
03:58:37,950 --> 03:58:39,110
You can't blow it up.

4982
03:58:39,230 --> 03:58:39,370
Sorry.

4983
03:58:39,510 --> 03:58:41,210
I have Metal Gear Brain right now.

4984
03:58:43,410 --> 03:58:44,050
Oh.

4985
03:58:44,210 --> 03:58:44,210
Oh.

4986
03:58:45,330 --> 03:58:45,450
Okay.

4987
03:58:46,050 --> 03:58:46,390
Stop.

4988
03:58:47,930 --> 03:58:49,070
It's unmanned.

4989
03:58:49,210 --> 03:58:51,730
Yeah, but I thought maybe someone would come and man it.

4990
03:58:58,010 --> 03:58:59,730
So much for...that.

4991
03:59:00,590 --> 03:59:01,130
Oh.

4992
03:59:05,560 --> 03:59:06,500
Let's redo.

4993
03:59:09,100 --> 03:59:09,740
Wait.

4994
03:59:10,300 --> 03:59:11,320
Uh...yeah, I'm on it.

4995
03:59:11,500 --> 03:59:11,520
Okay.

4996
03:59:11,520 --> 03:59:11,580
Okay.

4997
03:59:20,850 --> 03:59:21,650
Oh my God.

4998
03:59:21,910 --> 03:59:22,430
Oh my God.

4999
03:59:23,130 --> 03:59:23,750
Oh my God.

5000
03:59:26,430 --> 03:59:29,890
At least...I...took less...damage than I did before.

5001
03:59:30,230 --> 03:59:30,430
I think.

5002
03:59:31,110 --> 03:59:31,350
Okay.

5003
03:59:32,210 --> 03:59:32,250
Ugh.

5004
03:59:33,390 --> 03:59:33,870
Chunky.

5005
03:59:34,210 --> 03:59:35,090
Yeah, you're so chunky.

5006
03:59:36,090 --> 03:59:36,570
Okay.

5007
03:59:39,910 --> 03:59:41,170
Is there anything in these?

5008
03:59:41,990 --> 03:59:42,910
Please, say yes.

5009
03:59:43,730 --> 03:59:45,110
Oh, they...I can't destroy them.

5010
03:59:47,630 --> 03:59:48,270
Beep, beep.

5011
03:59:48,830 --> 03:59:49,210
Oh my God.

5012
03:59:51,610 --> 03:59:52,170
Oh.

5013
03:59:52,670 --> 03:59:53,230
Uh...

5014
03:59:53,650 --> 03:59:54,530
How do I...

5015
03:59:54,530 --> 03:59:56,030
How do I...man you?

5016
04:00:02,550 --> 04:00:03,110
Wait.

5017
04:00:03,330 --> 04:00:03,870
Please.

5018
04:00:07,630 --> 04:00:08,190
Uh...

5019
04:00:09,610 --> 04:00:10,170
Uh...

5020
04:00:11,190 --> 04:00:12,630
Barney can open that door.

5021
04:00:12,910 --> 04:00:13,270
Oh, true.

5022
04:00:16,050 --> 04:00:16,610
Okay.

5023
04:00:19,290 --> 04:00:20,890
Oh, we have to bring them all the way here?

5024
04:00:23,690 --> 04:00:24,470
What's in here?

5025
04:00:24,570 --> 04:00:24,830
What's in here, actually?

5026
04:00:30,100 --> 04:00:32,680
That's what I was hearing was that guy...

5027
04:00:32,680 --> 04:00:33,700
Oh, there's a shortcut.

5028
04:00:34,220 --> 04:00:34,660
Barney!

5029
04:00:36,380 --> 04:00:37,540
Barney, Barney, Barney.

5030
04:00:38,060 --> 04:00:38,920
Barney, come here.

5031
04:00:40,580 --> 04:00:42,260
I won't let anything happen to you.

5032
04:00:42,680 --> 04:00:43,680
Okay, why not?

5033
04:00:43,920 --> 04:00:44,580
Actually, hold on.

5034
04:00:44,760 --> 04:00:45,280
Let me...

5035
04:00:47,280 --> 04:00:47,760
Really?

5036
04:00:48,180 --> 04:00:49,780
I have full ammo of everything?

5037
04:00:50,540 --> 04:00:51,620
I was gonna say...

5038
04:00:51,620 --> 04:00:51,980
There's no...

5039
04:00:51,980 --> 04:00:52,700
There's no way.

5040
04:00:53,400 --> 04:00:54,680
I'll bet that stings a bit.

5041
04:00:55,040 --> 04:00:55,600
Come on.

5042
04:00:55,800 --> 04:00:56,040
Come here.

5043
04:01:01,010 --> 04:01:01,590
There we go.

5044
04:01:01,730 --> 04:01:02,250
Okay, come on.

5045
04:01:06,960 --> 04:01:07,360
Uh...

5046
04:01:07,360 --> 04:01:07,700
This way.

5047
04:01:07,900 --> 04:01:08,680
This way, Barney.

5048
04:01:09,260 --> 04:01:09,880
Barney, Barney.

5049
04:01:11,500 --> 04:01:12,140
This way.

5050
04:01:15,840 --> 04:01:16,240
Barney?

5051
04:01:16,540 --> 04:01:17,420
Are you lost?

5052
04:01:19,120 --> 04:01:19,980
Oh, come on, come on.

5053
04:01:20,200 --> 04:01:20,760
Come on, buddy.

5054
04:01:22,540 --> 04:01:23,820
You go on without me.

5055
04:01:23,960 --> 04:01:24,460
No, no, no, no.

5056
04:01:24,480 --> 04:01:24,680
Come here.

5057
04:01:24,680 --> 04:01:25,240
Roger that.

5058
04:01:25,380 --> 04:01:26,360
Let's run like hell.

5059
04:01:26,520 --> 04:01:27,260
Okay, come here, come here.

5060
04:01:27,580 --> 04:01:27,960
Come on.

5061
04:01:29,140 --> 04:01:29,980
Is he stuck?

5062
04:01:33,080 --> 04:01:34,320
Are you stuck on the door?

5063
04:01:35,000 --> 04:01:37,080
This place is a lot bigger than I thought.

5064
04:01:37,900 --> 04:01:39,360
I can't push him, you guys.

5065
04:01:42,400 --> 04:01:43,220
No, please.

5066
04:01:45,100 --> 04:01:45,500
Okay.

5067
04:01:48,800 --> 04:01:49,740
Oh, come on.

5068
04:01:53,480 --> 04:01:54,820
Oh, okay, thank goodness.

5069
04:01:58,140 --> 04:01:59,200
Wait, how do I...

5070
04:01:59,200 --> 04:01:59,920
Oh, here, here.

5071
04:02:00,840 --> 04:02:01,360
Open this.

5072
04:02:03,920 --> 04:02:04,960
Please don't die here.

5073
04:02:05,280 --> 04:02:05,520
Please.

5074
04:02:05,900 --> 04:02:06,200
Barney.

5075
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:07,820
Barney, I'm...

5076
04:02:07,820 --> 04:02:08,720
I'm right behind...

5077
04:02:08,720 --> 04:02:09,940
I'm right here to get anything.

5078
04:02:10,200 --> 04:02:10,720
Don't run!

5079
04:02:11,220 --> 04:02:11,900
Where did I go?

5080
04:02:15,890 --> 04:02:16,850
Oh, what are you doing?

5081
04:02:22,770 --> 04:02:23,250
Nice.

5082
04:02:26,650 --> 04:02:27,830
He's a free man!

5083
04:02:29,490 --> 04:02:29,890
Okay.

5084
04:02:30,650 --> 04:02:31,530
Barney, watch out.

5085
04:02:31,930 --> 04:02:32,690
There could be...

5086
04:02:32,690 --> 04:02:34,090
There could be anything afoot.

5087
04:02:34,490 --> 04:02:35,850
I don't know if we should go any further.

5088
04:02:41,130 --> 04:02:42,130
What you were saying?

5089
04:02:42,370 --> 04:02:43,550
Anyway, you stay...

5090
04:02:43,550 --> 04:02:44,030
Oh, what's this?

5091
04:02:44,230 --> 04:02:45,150
Oh, I can't grab it.

5092
04:02:45,350 --> 04:02:46,010
Yeah, let's go.

5093
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:46,770
No, no, no, no.

5094
04:02:46,850 --> 04:02:47,330
You stay here.

5095
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:48,730
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5096
04:02:49,130 --> 04:02:49,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5097
04:02:49,730 --> 04:02:50,410
You come here.

5098
04:02:51,130 --> 04:02:51,570
Come here.

5099
04:02:52,050 --> 04:02:52,350
Okay.

5100
04:02:52,530 --> 04:02:53,950
We might live longer if we work together.

5101
04:02:54,230 --> 04:02:54,710
Come here, come here.

5102
04:02:54,890 --> 04:02:55,210
Open this.

5103
04:02:56,070 --> 04:02:57,090
Oh, just kidding.

5104
04:02:57,410 --> 04:02:58,690
I'll stay here and guard this area.

5105
04:02:58,910 --> 04:02:59,250
Yeah, yeah.

5106
04:02:59,490 --> 04:03:01,410
Wait, what am I supposed to...

5107
04:03:02,010 --> 04:03:02,750
...do here then?

5108
04:03:08,200 --> 04:03:09,000
Can in the door?

5109
04:03:09,140 --> 04:03:09,600
I tried!

5110
04:03:10,660 --> 04:03:11,860
Did I not do a good enough job?

5111
04:03:16,470 --> 04:03:17,430
Oh.

5112
04:03:17,710 --> 04:03:18,110
Oracle boom.

5113
04:03:22,310 --> 04:03:23,590
Other door, left side.

5114
04:03:23,790 --> 04:03:24,150
That one.

5115
04:03:24,750 --> 04:03:25,150
I tried.

5116
04:03:26,590 --> 04:03:27,090
Ah!

5117
04:03:28,030 --> 04:03:28,210
Ah.

5118
04:03:35,800 --> 04:03:36,840
Shoot Barney.

5119
04:03:37,000 --> 04:03:37,640
You wish.

5120
04:03:40,020 --> 04:03:41,500
You wish.

5121
04:03:44,920 --> 04:03:46,120
You wish.

5122
04:03:46,720 --> 04:03:47,160
You okay?

5123
04:03:47,740 --> 04:03:48,640
Yeah, he's fine.

5124
04:03:49,300 --> 04:03:50,620
Maybe a little traumatized.

5125
04:03:59,980 --> 04:04:00,460
Okay.

5126
04:04:00,500 --> 04:04:00,540
Okay.

5127
04:04:04,600 --> 04:04:05,500
Bye Barney!

5128
04:04:06,060 --> 04:04:08,180
We...you guys, we kept one Barney alive.

5129
04:04:09,400 --> 04:04:09,880
Oh.

5130
04:04:10,280 --> 04:04:11,680
Why didn't I reload sooner?

5131
04:04:13,780 --> 04:04:15,440
We kept one Barney!

5132
04:04:16,580 --> 04:04:17,060
Oh.

5133
04:04:17,800 --> 04:04:18,640
What are those?

5134
04:04:18,820 --> 04:04:19,000
Oh.

5135
04:04:31,260 --> 04:04:33,260
Oh no, they're like respawning.

5136
04:04:33,500 --> 04:04:33,920
Oh gosh.

5137
04:04:34,700 --> 04:04:35,560
Use the gun.

5138
04:04:35,760 --> 04:04:36,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5139
04:04:36,540 --> 04:04:37,080
Okay, hold on.

5140
04:04:37,700 --> 04:04:38,220
Oh.

5141
04:04:38,440 --> 04:04:39,260
Uh oh, uh oh.

5142
04:04:53,970 --> 04:04:54,750
Is

5143
04:05:00,240 --> 04:05:01,200
that it?

5144
04:05:03,840 --> 04:05:04,620
Oh.

5145
04:05:11,150 --> 04:05:11,540
Think

5146
04:05:16,080 --> 04:05:17,060
we're good.

5147
04:05:18,560 --> 04:05:19,220
Minto Rambo.

5148
04:05:19,540 --> 04:05:20,220
Yeah, baby.

5149
04:05:20,220 --> 04:05:20,320
Maybe.

5150
04:05:27,530 --> 04:05:28,150
Um...

5151
04:05:28,150 --> 04:05:29,530
I wanna call it soon.

5152
04:05:29,850 --> 04:05:31,930
But I don't know where to call it.

5153
04:05:32,290 --> 04:05:33,070
You know?

5154
04:05:33,390 --> 04:05:34,110
I wanna...

5155
04:05:34,110 --> 04:05:35,170
I'm having fun still.

5156
04:05:35,170 --> 04:05:36,830
But I am getting a little...

5157
04:05:36,830 --> 04:05:37,750
Tired.

5158
04:05:38,790 --> 04:05:39,410
So...

5159
04:05:39,410 --> 04:05:41,330
I don't know...

5160
04:05:42,230 --> 04:05:43,390
Where to call.

5161
04:05:45,710 --> 04:05:46,230
Now?

5162
04:05:46,230 --> 04:05:47,410
Now's a good time, is it?

5163
04:05:49,050 --> 04:05:50,330
End of chapter soon?

5164
04:05:50,530 --> 04:05:51,170
Okay okay okay.

5165
04:05:52,250 --> 04:05:52,770
Uh...

5166
04:05:52,770 --> 04:05:53,550
If I can find...

5167
04:05:54,210 --> 04:05:54,550
How to...

5168
04:05:56,730 --> 04:05:57,250
Is...

5169
04:05:57,250 --> 04:05:57,830
Skip.

5170
04:06:05,950 --> 04:06:06,670
The middle?

5171
04:06:06,810 --> 04:06:07,150
The blob?

5172
04:06:07,150 --> 04:06:07,970
Really?

5173
04:06:08,190 --> 04:06:09,170
I got to go with that?

5174
04:06:09,890 --> 04:06:12,670
I got to go with this...

5175
04:06:20,080 --> 04:06:21,740
Oh, it's a trampoline.

5176
04:06:26,700 --> 04:06:28,580
This guy's talking from the dead.

5177
04:06:31,500 --> 04:06:33,940
I'm gonna get my grenades up.

5178
04:06:34,160 --> 04:06:34,240
Okay.

5179
04:06:38,430 --> 04:06:39,370
Is that me?

5180
04:06:39,630 --> 04:06:39,870
Oh, no.

5181
04:06:43,070 --> 04:06:44,310
I don't know what they're fighting.

5182
04:06:44,890 --> 04:06:46,010
Who will win?

5183
04:06:46,870 --> 04:06:48,010
Who will win?

5184
04:06:51,470 --> 04:06:52,650
I can't tell.

5185
04:06:54,010 --> 04:06:55,030
Who won?

5186
04:06:59,640 --> 04:07:00,880
Was that a robot?

5187
04:07:01,420 --> 04:07:07,170
Or... Who is that?

5188
04:07:08,670 --> 04:07:09,950
Mean toe will win.

5189
04:07:10,310 --> 04:07:11,010
Was that the bees?

5190
04:07:11,710 --> 04:07:12,890
The snark?

5191
04:07:22,240 --> 04:07:23,640
The big alien.

5192
04:07:35,060 --> 04:07:35,720
Okay, hold on.

5193
04:07:36,180 --> 04:07:36,440
Redo.

5194
04:07:36,780 --> 04:07:36,880
Sorry.

5195
04:07:37,060 --> 04:07:39,620
I don't want to use my... I don't want to use my crossbow for that.

5196
04:07:41,780 --> 04:07:48,020
Every time I go in a hole, I know I should... I know I should not use crossbow.

5197
04:07:48,180 --> 04:07:49,880
Or like, you know, I should equip something like this.

5198
04:07:50,080 --> 04:07:51,420
Just in case it's a headcrab too.

5199
04:08:07,400 --> 04:08:09,200
I'm getting a taste of my own medicine.

5200
04:08:13,890 --> 04:08:15,170
What the hell are those?

5201
04:08:17,930 --> 04:08:18,450
Oh.

5202
04:08:20,370 --> 04:08:20,710
Oh.

5203
04:08:20,850 --> 04:08:20,850
Oh.

5204
04:08:22,930 --> 04:08:23,090
Oh.

5205
04:08:23,090 --> 04:08:23,730
Got it.

5206
04:08:25,270 --> 04:08:25,870
Oh, wait.

5207
04:08:25,930 --> 04:08:27,110
Let's go get... Let's heal again.

5208
04:08:28,090 --> 04:08:29,130
Oh, crowbar.

5209
04:08:29,290 --> 04:08:29,890
Yeah, crowbar.

5210
04:08:30,750 --> 04:08:33,670
I forget that I'm crouched.

5211
04:08:35,010 --> 04:08:36,190
So it would be easy.

5212
04:08:38,330 --> 04:08:38,970
Come on.

5213
04:08:39,110 --> 04:08:39,590
You can do it.

5214
04:08:39,930 --> 04:08:40,290
I believe.

5215
04:08:41,110 --> 04:08:41,330
I believe.

5216
04:08:41,530 --> 04:08:41,750
I believe.

5217
04:08:41,810 --> 04:08:41,910
I believe.

5218
04:08:42,830 --> 04:08:43,270
Nice.

5219
04:08:43,450 --> 04:08:43,710
There we go.

5220
04:08:44,870 --> 04:08:45,430
Come on.

5221
04:08:46,170 --> 04:08:46,610
Crouch.

5222
04:08:47,310 --> 04:08:47,750
Jump.

5223
04:08:48,230 --> 04:08:48,670
No.

5224
04:08:51,170 --> 04:08:52,230
Use your fists.

5225
04:09:01,560 --> 04:09:02,460
Control space.

5226
04:09:03,240 --> 04:09:03,400
Yeah.

5227
04:09:03,640 --> 04:09:03,800
Yeah.

5228
04:09:03,900 --> 04:09:04,540
That's what I'm doing.

5229
04:09:07,180 --> 04:09:07,660
Yep.

5230
04:09:08,480 --> 04:09:08,960
Yeah.

5231
04:09:09,840 --> 04:09:11,360
That's what... That's what that is.

5232
04:09:16,920 --> 04:09:18,480
I think it's too high, guys.

5233
04:09:20,540 --> 04:09:21,520
It's too high.

5234
04:09:21,660 --> 04:09:22,100
It's not me.

5235
04:09:23,060 --> 04:09:24,440
I know how to crouch jump.

5236
04:09:26,980 --> 04:09:27,840
It's not me.

5237
04:09:27,980 --> 04:09:28,460
It's too high.

5238
04:09:30,620 --> 04:09:31,620
This bait?

5239
04:09:32,180 --> 04:09:33,360
I guess so.

5240
04:09:41,040 --> 04:09:41,760
Wait.

5241
04:09:41,900 --> 04:09:42,380
I'm stuck.

5242
04:09:42,740 --> 04:09:43,100
AHHH!

5243
04:09:49,100 --> 04:09:50,540
Space microbar!

5244
04:09:51,080 --> 04:09:52,040
Tick die!

5245
04:09:55,660 --> 04:09:57,240
Oh god, I'm really about to die.

5246
04:09:59,680 --> 04:10:00,660
I made it.

5247
04:10:00,880 --> 04:10:02,140
I lived, somehow.

5248
04:10:06,260 --> 04:10:08,800
That was quite cinematic, it really was.

5249
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:09,800
Here, I'm gonna redo it.

5250
04:10:10,580 --> 04:10:13,120
And I'm gonna use my gun instead.

5251
04:10:13,580 --> 04:10:14,200
Okay, here we go.

5252
04:10:14,520 --> 04:10:15,460
Oh, I'm gonna reload.

5253
04:10:16,140 --> 04:10:18,100
The thrill of reloading in battle.

5254
04:10:18,720 --> 04:10:19,480
All right, let's go.

5255
04:10:20,580 --> 04:10:23,780
Oh, uh... That's right, I got him.

5256
04:10:38,460 --> 04:10:40,820
We took way less damage, I don't know.

5257
04:10:43,280 --> 04:10:44,260
Hookie dokie!

5258
04:10:44,500 --> 04:10:44,780
Oh, wait.

5259
04:10:45,180 --> 04:10:46,140
There we go.

5260
04:10:46,780 --> 04:10:47,200
Awesome.

5261
04:10:48,200 --> 04:10:48,760
Awesome!

5262
04:10:49,300 --> 04:10:49,820
Yippee!

5263
04:11:04,230 --> 04:11:04,910
Oh!

5264
04:11:04,910 --> 04:11:06,190
Uh...

5265
04:11:06,910 --> 04:11:08,110
Uh...

5266
04:11:15,170 --> 04:11:15,890
Oh!

5267
04:11:21,120 --> 04:11:22,160
Uh...

5268
04:11:22,160 --> 04:11:23,140
Yes.

5269
04:11:24,960 --> 04:11:26,680
Wait, what is this doing?

5270
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:27,820
Actually.

5271
04:11:28,860 --> 04:11:29,920
Just notice these.

5272
04:11:31,900 --> 04:11:32,860
What did I do?

5273
04:11:34,780 --> 04:11:35,300
What?

5274
04:11:36,520 --> 04:11:37,800
Go for a drive.

5275
04:11:40,300 --> 04:11:41,580
What kind of car is this?

5276
04:11:41,820 --> 04:11:42,900
Car nerds.

5277
04:11:43,440 --> 04:11:44,820
All car otaku rise up.

5278
04:11:44,940 --> 04:11:45,500
What car is that?

5279
04:11:45,840 --> 04:11:46,180
What the?

5280
04:11:48,700 --> 04:11:49,560
How'd that happen?

5281
04:11:57,430 --> 04:11:57,930
Scones!

5282
04:11:59,810 --> 04:12:00,810
Let's scones!

5283
04:12:08,940 --> 04:12:10,900
It is a really big car, yeah.

5284
04:12:18,340 --> 04:12:19,180
There we go.

5285
04:12:22,620 --> 04:12:23,220
Um...

5286
04:12:23,220 --> 04:12:24,560
Can I...

5287
04:12:28,440 --> 04:12:29,040
Uh...

5288
04:12:29,040 --> 04:12:29,560
Dang it.

5289
04:12:31,720 --> 04:12:32,520
Uh...

5290
04:12:32,520 --> 04:12:33,020
Uh...

5291
04:12:33,020 --> 04:12:33,540
Let me see...

5292
04:12:33,540 --> 04:12:34,100
Maybe this one?

5293
04:12:35,260 --> 04:12:35,660
No?

5294
04:12:35,980 --> 04:12:37,040
I thought I would lift it.

5295
04:12:37,460 --> 04:12:38,220
The switch?

5296
04:12:38,640 --> 04:12:39,200
Yeah.

5297
04:12:40,520 --> 04:12:41,240
Oh!

5298
04:12:47,220 --> 04:12:48,160
Oh, the...

5299
04:12:48,160 --> 04:12:48,620
Ah!

5300
04:12:48,620 --> 04:12:48,740
Ah!

5301
04:12:52,520 --> 04:12:53,400
Oh.

5302
04:13:05,680 --> 04:13:06,560
Uh...

5303
04:13:06,560 --> 04:13:06,760
Wait.

5304
04:13:17,710 --> 04:13:18,990
That was...

5305
04:13:18,990 --> 04:13:20,570
Less than ideal, but...

5306
04:13:20,570 --> 04:13:21,550
Got the job done.

5307
04:13:23,810 --> 04:13:25,130
Let's scones!

5308
04:13:26,350 --> 04:13:26,670
Okay.

5309
04:13:27,030 --> 04:13:28,890
And we...

5310
04:13:28,890 --> 04:13:29,430
Boop!

5311
04:13:30,910 --> 04:13:32,130
That worked somehow.

5312
04:13:33,110 --> 04:13:33,510
Alright.

5313
04:13:34,050 --> 04:13:34,750
Let's get to that gun.

5314
04:13:43,620 --> 04:13:45,100
No bees today.

5315
04:13:45,660 --> 04:13:47,200
No bees tomorrow.

5316
04:13:49,420 --> 04:13:50,220
No...

5317
04:13:50,220 --> 04:13:51,520
No bees any day!

5318
04:13:56,720 --> 04:13:58,460
I hear no more footsteps.

5319
04:14:01,930 --> 04:14:02,590
Yeah!

5320
04:14:02,590 --> 04:14:02,830
Damn!

5321
04:14:06,690 --> 04:14:07,690
I'm guessing...

5322
04:14:07,690 --> 04:14:08,870
Is this another...

5323
04:14:10,010 --> 04:14:10,530
Another...

5324
04:14:10,530 --> 04:14:11,910
Nipple trampoline?

5325
04:14:12,710 --> 04:14:13,230
Or...

5326
04:14:13,230 --> 04:14:14,190
Oh, okay.

5327
04:14:14,410 --> 04:14:14,910
Never mind.

5328
04:14:19,460 --> 04:14:19,980
Alright.

5329
04:14:20,840 --> 04:14:21,360
Onwards.

5330
04:14:35,760 --> 04:14:40,400
Your military forces are pathetic when they're getting their asses kicked by a theoretical physicist.

5331
04:14:40,720 --> 04:14:41,820
They are so...

5332
04:14:56,780 --> 04:14:58,140
Did you see them over there?

5333
04:15:01,300 --> 04:15:02,380
Come on!

5334
04:15:06,280 --> 04:15:08,500
I literally threaded the needle.

5335
04:15:11,980 --> 04:15:13,640
There's someone still down here.

5336
04:15:15,760 --> 04:15:16,520
There we go.

5337
04:15:16,680 --> 04:15:17,460
S-save.

5338
04:15:18,380 --> 04:15:18,880
Well, okay.

5339
04:15:19,000 --> 04:15:19,280
Saved.

5340
04:15:19,400 --> 04:15:19,640
Okay, good.

5341
04:15:26,490 --> 04:15:26,770
No!

5342
04:15:26,870 --> 04:15:27,330
The bees!

5343
04:15:30,110 --> 04:15:30,670
Um...

5344
04:15:30,670 --> 04:15:30,950
Ouch!

5345
04:15:31,150 --> 04:15:31,750
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

5346
04:15:32,350 --> 04:15:32,910
Uh...

5347
04:15:32,910 --> 04:15:33,570
More bees.

5348
04:15:35,070 --> 04:15:35,630
Maybe...

5349
04:15:40,270 --> 04:15:40,450
peach fractures.

5350
04:15:41,290 --> 04:15:42,490
I don't think that...

5351
04:15:43,770 --> 04:15:44,130
Worked!

5352
04:15:45,790 --> 04:15:46,150
Woooo!

5353
04:15:48,280 --> 04:15:48,640
Oh...

5354
04:15:48,640 --> 04:15:49,260
Bees, bees, bees!

5355
04:15:49,460 --> 04:15:49,800
Bee, bee, bees.

5356
04:15:49,880 --> 04:15:50,720
보, be, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

5357
04:15:50,720 --> 04:15:52,320
Bug-b-bees, bu, bu, bu, bu, buh, buh, buh, bu...

5358
04:15:54,000 --> 04:15:54,360
Please...

5359
04:15:58,090 --> 04:15:59,130
What do I...

5360
04:15:59,130 --> 04:16:00,290
Want to...

5361
04:16:00,290 --> 04:16:00,630
Throw?

5362
04:16:01,690 --> 04:16:03,930
Use MY bees against HIS bees?

5363
04:16:05,550 --> 04:16:06,370
Counter the bees!

5364
04:16:06,370 --> 04:16:06,470
Jeez.

5365
04:16:15,630 --> 04:16:16,670
Can I bait him?

5366
04:16:21,070 --> 04:16:21,730
Where'd he go?

5367
04:16:31,520 --> 04:16:35,920
I don't think it hones, even if you... unless you, like, see the guy, it seems.

5368
04:16:36,440 --> 04:16:37,140
Kinda sucks.

5369
04:16:39,660 --> 04:16:40,600
Uh, let's see.

5370
04:16:40,760 --> 04:16:43,220
Maybe I can bait him if I...

5371
04:16:49,400 --> 04:16:50,380
Oh, did I get him?

5372
04:16:51,180 --> 04:16:52,520
Oh, I got him!

5373
04:16:53,480 --> 04:16:54,520
That worked!

5374
04:16:54,940 --> 04:16:55,520
Nice.

5375
04:16:59,000 --> 04:16:59,580
Nice.

5376
04:17:00,100 --> 04:17:01,380
We were able to use it.

5377
04:17:07,340 --> 04:17:07,920
Okay.

5378
04:17:08,400 --> 04:17:10,020
Or, we'll switch to this.

5379
04:17:10,240 --> 04:17:10,300
Okay.

5380
04:17:11,340 --> 04:17:13,740
Before we go over that way.

5381
04:17:17,200 --> 04:17:17,780
Oh, wait.

5382
04:17:17,900 --> 04:17:18,600
I just saved it, didn't I?

5383
04:17:18,700 --> 04:17:19,020
It's fine.

5384
04:17:20,080 --> 04:17:20,900
Anything in here?

5385
04:17:21,960 --> 04:17:23,420
For me to take?

5386
04:17:25,980 --> 04:17:26,620
Oh.

5387
04:17:26,880 --> 04:17:27,880
We got some stuffs.

5388
04:17:28,700 --> 04:17:30,000
And... this stuffs.

5389
04:17:30,620 --> 04:17:31,420
Good stuffs.

5390
04:17:31,940 --> 04:17:32,600
Good stuff.

5391
04:17:32,740 --> 04:17:33,200
Good stuff.

5392
04:17:33,560 --> 04:17:34,580
Good stuff.

5393
04:17:35,640 --> 04:17:36,620
Good stuff.

5394
04:17:36,980 --> 04:17:37,640
Good stuff.

5395
04:17:38,720 --> 04:17:39,200
Awesome.

5396
04:17:40,100 --> 04:17:42,300
I wish... I wish I could have whatever's in there.

5397
04:17:42,840 --> 04:17:44,340
So much stuff!

5398
04:17:44,340 --> 04:17:44,660
Awful.

5399
04:17:47,240 --> 04:17:47,760
Aaaaah.

5400
04:17:49,360 --> 04:17:49,880
Aaaaah.

5401
04:17:50,320 --> 04:17:51,120
Gustav's room!

5402
04:17:52,700 --> 04:17:53,220
Ah.

5403
04:17:53,460 --> 04:17:56,520
If I weren't already dead, I'd be telling you to kill me again.

5404
04:17:56,780 --> 04:17:57,540
Ha ha ha ha.

5405
04:17:58,420 --> 04:17:59,080
Or kill me.

5406
04:17:59,320 --> 04:18:04,240
If I weren't already dead, I'd tell you to kill me.

5407
04:18:07,540 --> 04:18:09,600
Okay, we got to parkour this one, guys.

5408
04:18:10,100 --> 04:18:12,480
They left us the tiniest platform ever.

5409
04:18:16,080 --> 04:18:17,080
Who am I hearing?

5410
04:18:17,320 --> 04:18:18,400
I'm hearing a bee, ma'am.

5411
04:18:20,620 --> 04:18:22,820
You could call him a bee-lister.

5412
04:18:25,280 --> 04:18:29,580
Before you end, there's a little custom spray for you and your general tag.

5413
04:18:30,440 --> 04:18:30,920
A what?

5414
04:18:52,410 --> 04:18:53,610
Sure, I'll take it.

5415
04:18:54,130 --> 04:18:55,250
A tea spray.

5416
04:18:55,610 --> 04:18:57,450
Well, how do I... equip that?

5417
04:18:58,250 --> 04:19:00,850
Oh my gosh.

5418
04:19:05,160 --> 04:19:06,260
There's another one.

5419
04:19:06,720 --> 04:19:08,960
I like how this is... these are the guys we're fighting now.

5420
04:19:10,620 --> 04:19:11,940
Yo, the tea...

5421
04:19:11,940 --> 04:19:13,460
Like that?

5422
04:19:14,120 --> 04:19:15,740
Wait, how do I...

5423
04:19:15,740 --> 04:19:16,440
Could I...

5424
04:19:16,440 --> 04:19:16,860
How do I...

5425
04:19:16,860 --> 04:19:17,520
How...

5426
04:19:18,300 --> 04:19:18,900
Wait.

5427
04:19:19,300 --> 04:19:21,140
So, if I...

5428
04:19:21,140 --> 04:19:23,320
In my general tag...

5429
04:19:23,320 --> 04:19:24,480
If I...

5430
04:19:24,480 --> 04:19:26,120
How would I upload it, though?

5431
04:19:26,820 --> 04:19:27,640
Oh, in multiplayer!

5432
04:19:34,120 --> 04:19:35,440
I don't see...

5433
04:19:36,320 --> 04:19:36,860
I...

5434
04:19:37,480 --> 04:19:38,020
What?

5435
04:19:40,820 --> 04:19:41,900
What is...

5436
04:19:42,520 --> 04:19:43,340
What is this?

5437
04:19:45,660 --> 04:19:48,180
I just went to my general tag and hit latest.

5438
04:19:48,980 --> 04:19:49,520
And...

5439
04:19:49,520 --> 04:19:51,220
I don't like what I saw.

5440
04:19:58,740 --> 04:20:00,420
It works for single player, too.

5441
04:20:00,520 --> 04:20:01,320
I don't see it.

5442
04:20:03,700 --> 04:20:04,220
Maybe...

5443
04:20:04,220 --> 04:20:05,940
Is it like the hashtag mint phantom?

5444
04:20:11,820 --> 04:20:13,000
I don't see it.

5445
04:20:15,280 --> 04:20:17,380
Oh, I see it!

5446
04:20:18,000 --> 04:20:18,700
Thank you!

5447
04:20:20,040 --> 04:20:20,680
Okay.

5448
04:20:22,560 --> 04:20:24,580
Select it in settings under multiplayer.

5449
04:20:25,160 --> 04:20:25,760
And press T.

5450
04:20:26,740 --> 04:20:27,480
Thank you!

5451
04:20:28,500 --> 04:20:30,200
But it has to be in multiplayer?

5452
04:20:33,240 --> 04:20:34,440
Now wondering.

5453
04:20:34,720 --> 04:20:35,140
Don't...

5454
04:20:35,140 --> 04:20:36,200
Don't worry about it.

5455
04:20:40,090 --> 04:20:41,630
That's the general tag, no?

5456
04:20:41,630 --> 04:20:43,270
What, hashtag mint phantom?

5457
04:20:43,490 --> 04:20:44,230
But I have one!

5458
04:20:44,490 --> 04:20:45,450
It's the...

5459
04:20:45,450 --> 04:20:47,030
The hashtag...

5460
04:20:47,030 --> 04:20:49,210
I have it labeled as general.

5461
04:20:49,750 --> 04:20:51,510
I mean, they're both kind of general.

5462
04:20:52,010 --> 04:20:53,290
But the...

5463
04:20:53,290 --> 04:20:54,590
Mintoshin, Leishashin...

5464
04:20:54,590 --> 04:20:55,830
It used to be my...

5465
04:20:55,830 --> 04:20:56,930
Fan art tag.

5466
04:20:57,950 --> 04:20:59,030
And now...

5467
04:20:59,030 --> 04:21:01,210
But because, you know...

5468
04:21:01,210 --> 04:21:03,070
Nihongo-muzukeshi...

5469
04:21:03,910 --> 04:21:04,270
Uh...

5470
04:21:04,270 --> 04:21:04,970
Uh...

5471
04:21:04,970 --> 04:21:05,950
I changed it.

5472
04:21:06,190 --> 04:21:07,190
But now that's...

5473
04:21:07,190 --> 04:21:08,590
Technically the general tag.

5474
04:21:09,170 --> 04:21:09,530
But...

5475
04:21:10,190 --> 04:21:10,550
Anyway.

5476
04:21:10,830 --> 04:21:10,990
Anyway!

5477
04:21:11,250 --> 04:21:11,890
Don't worry about it.

5478
04:21:11,990 --> 04:21:12,630
Don't worry about it.

5479
04:21:12,710 --> 04:21:12,790
Okay.

5480
04:21:16,390 --> 04:21:16,750
Um...

5481
04:21:16,750 --> 04:21:17,150
Where was I?

5482
04:21:17,210 --> 04:21:17,750
I'm just gonna save.

5483
04:21:17,890 --> 04:21:18,310
I don't remember.

5484
04:21:18,430 --> 04:21:18,970
The last time I saved.

5485
04:21:19,090 --> 04:21:19,270
Okay.

5486
04:21:26,840 --> 04:21:28,360
I love blowing people up.

5487
04:21:29,220 --> 04:21:29,940
Did he run?

5488
04:21:30,240 --> 04:21:31,560
I think I only got one guy.

5489
04:21:32,180 --> 04:21:33,080
I got one guy.

5490
04:21:38,420 --> 04:21:39,580
Did he go around the corner?

5491
04:21:41,060 --> 04:21:42,240
Oh, he exploded.

5492
04:21:42,740 --> 04:21:42,860
Oh.

5493
04:21:44,040 --> 04:21:44,520
Nice.

5494
04:21:46,100 --> 04:21:46,580
Nice.

5495
04:21:53,640 --> 04:21:54,620
Oh, you got me.

5496
04:21:59,760 --> 04:22:00,640
No, not me!

5497
04:22:03,340 --> 04:22:04,380
No, don't get me!

5498
04:22:04,840 --> 04:22:05,760
Get the guy over there!

5499
04:22:06,220 --> 04:22:06,620
Wait.

5500
04:22:06,900 --> 04:22:08,040
He'll think it's the bee man.

5501
04:22:09,800 --> 04:22:10,280
Oh.

5502
04:22:11,780 --> 04:22:12,300
Wait.

5503
04:22:12,560 --> 04:22:13,220
Oh, friendly fire!

5504
04:22:13,340 --> 04:22:13,920
Friendly fire!

5505
04:22:27,280 --> 04:22:28,400
We got him.

5506
04:22:29,680 --> 04:22:31,020
Oh, it was his bees?

5507
04:22:31,500 --> 04:22:33,180
I can't tell whose bees are mine.

5508
04:22:33,300 --> 04:22:34,120
I'm using his bees.

5509
04:22:34,380 --> 04:22:35,780
I'm using your bees against you.

5510
04:22:37,400 --> 04:22:38,280
I'm using...

5511
04:22:38,280 --> 04:22:38,500
Ouch!

5512
04:22:38,640 --> 04:22:38,780
Ouch!

5513
04:22:38,980 --> 04:22:39,080
Ouch!

5514
04:22:39,320 --> 04:22:39,560
Wait.

5515
04:22:40,580 --> 04:22:41,680
I'm using your...

5516
04:22:41,680 --> 04:22:43,920
I'm using human technology against you.

5517
04:22:48,660 --> 04:22:49,280
Did it?

5518
04:22:49,280 --> 04:22:50,220
Work?

5519
04:22:53,270 --> 04:22:54,350
Oh my god.

5520
04:22:54,550 --> 04:22:55,090
Are you kidding me?

5521
04:22:56,850 --> 04:22:57,810
Okay, never mind.

5522
04:22:57,950 --> 04:23:00,030
I'm not using human technology against you.

5523
04:23:00,270 --> 04:23:00,850
It's flawed!

5524
04:23:01,130 --> 04:23:01,910
It's flawed.

5525
04:23:02,170 --> 04:23:03,090
It's flawed.

5526
04:23:03,350 --> 04:23:04,290
It's flawed.

5527
04:23:08,120 --> 04:23:08,680
It's flawed.

5528
04:23:08,680 --> 04:23:09,080
We got him.

5529
04:23:16,120 --> 04:23:17,120
It's flawed!

5530
04:23:19,040 --> 04:23:19,600
Okay.

5531
04:23:19,840 --> 04:23:21,700
Now we can jump down, I guess.

5532
04:23:22,200 --> 04:23:22,660
Or...

5533
04:23:22,660 --> 04:23:23,060
Hold on.

5534
04:23:23,100 --> 04:23:23,880
Let me go heal again.

5535
04:23:24,620 --> 04:23:26,140
Ancient human tech.

5536
04:23:26,140 --> 04:23:26,260
Quick.

5537
04:23:28,020 --> 04:23:28,740
Actually.

5538
04:23:32,380 --> 04:23:34,240
The technology is fine.

5539
04:23:34,240 --> 04:23:35,000
It's the technique.

5540
04:23:36,060 --> 04:23:36,780
Um...

5541
04:23:36,780 --> 04:23:37,320
Uh...

5542
04:23:37,320 --> 04:23:38,420
If it wasn't...

5543
04:23:38,420 --> 04:23:41,980
If it were actually not flawed, then...

5544
04:23:41,980 --> 04:23:44,580
Anyone would have been able to use it.

5545
04:23:44,720 --> 04:23:45,740
And it would have been...

5546
04:23:45,740 --> 04:23:46,400
Perfect.

5547
04:23:47,940 --> 04:23:48,660
So...

5548
04:23:48,660 --> 04:23:48,860
Um...

5549
04:23:48,860 --> 04:23:49,680
Actually...

5550
04:23:49,680 --> 04:23:50,680
It was flawed.

5551
04:23:51,060 --> 04:23:51,360
Oh.

5552
04:23:52,420 --> 04:23:54,820
Because if it weren't flawed, then anybody...

5553
04:23:55,260 --> 04:23:56,440
Would be able to use it.

5554
04:23:56,560 --> 04:23:56,940
No problem.

5555
04:23:57,320 --> 04:23:57,700
No problem.

5556
04:24:00,520 --> 04:24:01,560
Just saying.

5557
04:24:03,440 --> 04:24:04,620
Sure, sure.

5558
04:24:06,740 --> 04:24:07,460
That's...

5559
04:24:07,460 --> 04:24:08,800
That's the honest truth.

5560
04:24:08,800 --> 04:24:11,140
Where is the exit?

5561
04:24:11,420 --> 04:24:12,000
You ca...

5562
04:24:12,000 --> 04:24:13,020
What the?

5563
04:24:13,580 --> 04:24:15,680
Oh, that's a dead guy.

5564
04:24:28,910 --> 04:24:29,710
Hey.

5565
04:24:30,430 --> 04:24:31,150
Quit running.

5566
04:24:34,890 --> 04:24:35,690
Stop.

5567
04:24:35,990 --> 04:24:36,490
Stop it.

5568
04:24:36,790 --> 04:24:37,190
Stop.

5569
04:24:37,390 --> 04:24:38,050
Stop skipping.

5570
04:24:38,570 --> 04:24:39,690
Stop skipping.

5571
04:24:45,460 --> 04:24:46,260
Nice.

5572
04:24:48,640 --> 04:24:50,260
He's got the zoomies.

5573
04:24:51,460 --> 04:24:53,540
He's just an excited little man.

5574
04:24:53,940 --> 04:24:54,120
Huh.

5575
04:25:02,300 --> 04:25:02,860
Actually...

5576
04:25:05,040 --> 04:25:07,560
I can't tell where those sounds are coming from.

5577
04:25:08,300 --> 04:25:08,860
Actually...

5578
04:25:08,860 --> 04:25:10,080
Let's use our shotgun.

5579
04:25:10,360 --> 04:25:10,500
Okay.

5580
04:25:15,880 --> 04:25:17,440
Where am I hearing this from?

5581
04:25:18,440 --> 04:25:20,660
Where am I hearing all the noise from?

5582
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:22,920
Oh.

5583
04:25:25,860 --> 04:25:26,420
Oh!

5584
04:25:28,080 --> 04:25:30,300
I thought it was a person.

5585
04:25:36,060 --> 04:25:37,940
I thought it was a person.

5586
04:25:41,080 --> 04:25:41,740
Oops.

5587
04:25:42,240 --> 04:25:42,640
Okay.

5588
04:25:42,960 --> 04:25:43,360
Anyway.

5589
04:25:43,700 --> 04:25:43,820
Um.

5590
04:25:46,900 --> 04:25:47,960
Let's redo that.

5591
04:25:49,660 --> 04:25:50,320
Um.

5592
04:25:51,200 --> 04:25:52,360
Oh no, please.

5593
04:25:54,320 --> 04:25:55,360
Okay, hold on.

5594
04:25:56,800 --> 04:25:57,120
Okay.

5595
04:25:57,300 --> 04:25:57,400
Okay.

5596
04:25:59,140 --> 04:25:59,820
Whee!

5597
04:26:00,520 --> 04:26:01,880
Yeah, there we go.

5598
04:26:07,580 --> 04:26:08,160
Okay.

5599
04:26:08,860 --> 04:26:09,400
Okay.

5600
04:26:09,980 --> 04:26:10,220
Alright.

5601
04:26:10,700 --> 04:26:11,360
Nothing around here?

5602
04:26:11,520 --> 04:26:11,640
Okay.

5603
04:26:12,860 --> 04:26:13,240
Take it.

5604
04:26:14,660 --> 04:26:16,180
Half-Life classic, truly.

5605
04:26:17,680 --> 04:26:20,120
Oh, wait.

5606
04:26:24,180 --> 04:26:33,500
Let's put on our shoddy and go in and... Okay, I'm in.

5607
04:26:33,980 --> 04:26:35,540
How much longer is that?

5608
04:26:53,260 --> 04:26:53,700
Okay.

5609
04:26:53,700 --> 04:26:54,340
Can I get this guy?

5610
04:27:02,630 --> 04:27:04,530
I still take so much damage.

5611
04:27:05,210 --> 04:27:06,190
Are you kidding me?

5612
04:27:08,990 --> 04:27:10,470
How did they know I was in here?

5613
04:27:13,830 --> 04:27:15,310
Oh, I should have crouched.

5614
04:27:15,610 --> 04:27:16,470
Oh, here, I'll redo it.

5615
04:27:19,170 --> 04:27:23,010
Oh, I thought being in the water was good enough.

5616
04:27:23,510 --> 04:27:24,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5617
04:27:25,290 --> 04:27:26,970
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

5618
04:27:27,150 --> 04:27:27,510
Hold on.

5619
04:27:27,610 --> 04:27:28,910
Maybe I can get this guy, too, though.

5620
04:27:30,670 --> 04:27:31,310
Okay, everybody.

5621
04:27:32,250 --> 04:27:32,610
Scones!

5622
04:27:38,750 --> 04:27:39,110
Nice.

5623
04:27:44,110 --> 04:27:47,210
Or, maybe I shouldn't... It's too late.

5624
04:27:47,350 --> 04:27:47,730
It's fine.

5625
04:27:47,890 --> 04:27:50,890
I was gonna say, maybe I should use the crossbow instead, but...

5626
04:27:51,950 --> 04:27:53,730
How does this thing stay intact?

5627
04:28:00,820 --> 04:28:01,300
Oh.

5628
04:28:04,740 --> 04:28:06,100
Only Gordon had a helmet.

5629
04:28:07,880 --> 04:28:09,060
The time for a nade?

5630
04:28:09,320 --> 04:28:09,960
You're still right?

5631
04:28:16,970 --> 04:28:18,650
Oh, I think I got something, though.

5632
04:28:26,930 --> 04:28:27,870
You think he's dead?

5633
04:28:30,710 --> 04:28:33,030
You think he's dead?

5634
04:28:33,030 --> 04:28:33,950
Yeah, I think he's dead.

5635
04:28:34,950 --> 04:28:36,530
Send in the bugs.

5636
04:28:40,370 --> 04:28:43,210
I think I got a turret that was here.

5637
04:28:44,210 --> 04:28:44,670
Medic!

5638
04:28:46,810 --> 04:28:48,470
It wasn't me.

5639
04:28:50,670 --> 04:28:51,950
It wasn't me.

5640
04:28:54,730 --> 04:28:55,370
Medic!

5641
04:28:58,010 --> 04:28:59,790
Oh, it's a headcrab!

5642
04:29:01,390 --> 04:29:02,030
Holy...

5643
04:29:02,030 --> 04:29:03,290
Medic!

5644
04:29:11,820 --> 04:29:13,000
I don't wanna use that.

5645
04:29:13,260 --> 04:29:14,000
I'll just...

5646
04:29:15,760 --> 04:29:17,720
Can the... Can this attack...

5647
04:29:19,480 --> 04:29:20,440
Oh, it does.

5648
04:29:22,380 --> 04:29:23,020
Nice.

5649
04:29:30,910 --> 04:29:32,390
Aw, he... He won!

5650
04:29:32,870 --> 04:29:34,470
Oh, he was capable... He was actually...

5651
04:29:34,470 --> 04:29:35,510
Actually competent.

5652
04:29:36,610 --> 04:29:38,310
He was competent for once.

5653
04:29:38,930 --> 04:29:39,030
Oh!

5654
04:29:39,210 --> 04:29:39,430
Oh!

5655
04:29:39,710 --> 04:29:40,630
And then he exploded!

5656
04:29:41,030 --> 04:29:41,430
Why?

5657
04:29:47,930 --> 04:29:49,730
Okay, I guess I'll go down, no.

5658
04:29:50,910 --> 04:29:52,030
Wait, what's that?

5659
04:29:53,250 --> 04:29:54,190
What does that do?

5660
04:29:59,390 --> 04:29:59,810
Uh...

5661
04:29:59,810 --> 04:30:00,090
Oh!

5662
04:30:00,350 --> 04:30:00,470
Oh!

5663
04:30:00,650 --> 04:30:01,250
I did it.

5664
04:30:04,660 --> 04:30:05,080
Oh!

5665
04:30:06,520 --> 04:30:06,940
Uh...

5666
04:30:07,360 --> 04:30:07,780
Okay.

5667
04:30:08,640 --> 04:30:09,060
Alright.

5668
04:30:12,120 --> 04:30:13,980
I don't think I wanna go...

5669
04:30:13,980 --> 04:30:14,320
Oh!

5670
04:30:14,540 --> 04:30:14,760
I'm...

5671
04:30:14,760 --> 04:30:15,280
Oh, dang it!

5672
04:30:15,300 --> 04:30:15,900
I wasted it!

5673
04:30:16,660 --> 04:30:17,660
Here, I'll just...

5674
04:30:17,660 --> 04:30:18,080
There we go.

5675
04:30:18,200 --> 04:30:18,940
Okay, just in case.

5676
04:30:23,440 --> 04:30:24,040
That's it?

5677
04:30:24,240 --> 04:30:24,980
I go inside?

5678
04:30:25,860 --> 04:30:26,940
There's nothing down here?

5679
04:30:27,080 --> 04:30:27,360
Okay.

5680
04:30:30,780 --> 04:30:31,460
Go in.

5681
04:30:31,620 --> 04:30:32,380
Yeah, I'm at a hundred.

5682
04:30:32,680 --> 04:30:33,740
I was thinking...

5683
04:30:33,740 --> 04:30:34,560
Um...

5684
04:30:34,560 --> 04:30:34,940
Something else.

5685
04:30:40,020 --> 04:30:40,500
Okay.

5686
04:30:41,380 --> 04:30:41,600
Quick!

5687
04:30:43,340 --> 04:30:45,040
Why's it gotta be like this?

5688
04:30:45,340 --> 04:30:45,680
Okay.

5689
04:30:46,100 --> 04:30:46,360
There...

5690
04:30:46,360 --> 04:30:46,640
Come on.

5691
04:30:46,740 --> 04:30:47,120
Go in.

5692
04:30:47,180 --> 04:30:47,620
There we go.

5693
04:30:48,180 --> 04:30:48,300
Oh.

5694
04:30:48,860 --> 04:30:49,300
Oh.

5695
04:30:49,720 --> 04:30:50,200
Okay.

5696
04:30:56,500 --> 04:30:58,380
Doesn't that unused heal stay there?

5697
04:30:58,520 --> 04:30:59,080
I think so.

5698
04:30:59,320 --> 04:30:59,720
Yeah.

5699
04:31:01,020 --> 04:31:01,620
Let's...

5700
04:31:01,620 --> 04:31:03,120
Let's get our crossbow, just in case.

5701
04:31:06,140 --> 04:31:06,740
Alright.

5702
04:31:07,580 --> 04:31:08,360
Alright.

5703
04:31:08,780 --> 04:31:10,280
If anybody throws a...

5704
04:31:10,280 --> 04:31:11,800
C4 in...

5705
04:31:12,400 --> 04:31:13,160
Um...

5706
04:31:13,160 --> 04:31:13,820
I'm...

5707
04:31:13,940 --> 04:31:15,160
Almost prepared.

5708
04:31:26,550 --> 04:31:27,550
Quiet down!

5709
04:31:28,930 --> 04:31:29,570
Sillies.

5710
04:31:29,570 --> 04:31:32,410
B-1 oooohh.

5711
04:31:37,140 --> 04:31:37,840
Stand back.

5712
04:31:38,620 --> 04:31:39,280
Gah...

5713
04:31:39,280 --> 04:31:40,580
Barney!

5714
04:31:41,000 --> 04:31:42,620
Were you making all that ruckus!

5715
04:31:44,800 --> 04:31:45,460
Gah!

5716
04:31:45,460 --> 04:31:45,640
Gah!

5717
04:31:46,300 --> 04:31:47,600
Oh my god!

5718
04:31:47,600 --> 04:31:49,460
I almost killed Barney again!

5719
04:31:51,360 --> 04:31:52,020
Gah!

5720
04:31:52,020 --> 04:31:52,400
Gah!

5721
04:31:52,400 --> 04:31:53,800
Who was making all that sound?

5722
04:31:58,650 --> 04:31:59,310
Gah!

5723
04:31:59,310 --> 04:31:59,490
Gah!

5724
04:32:00,190 --> 04:32:01,110
That guy!

5725
04:32:01,390 --> 04:32:01,590
Gah!

5726
04:32:05,350 --> 04:32:06,830
I thought it was upstairs.

5727
04:32:08,310 --> 04:32:09,430
Okay, Barney, come on.

5728
04:32:10,910 --> 04:32:11,810
Yeah, yeah, come here.

5729
04:32:12,350 --> 04:32:13,090
Come on, Barney.

5730
04:32:15,190 --> 04:32:16,630
Crossbow is so OP.

5731
04:32:16,630 --> 04:32:17,290
It's awesome.

5732
04:32:17,290 --> 04:32:17,890
I love it.

5733
04:32:19,270 --> 04:32:22,430
Okay, um... Yeah, actually... Oh, my bad.

5734
04:32:23,750 --> 04:32:25,970
I have so many, so we'll just keep it.

5735
04:32:26,090 --> 04:32:26,350
Come on.

5736
04:32:28,390 --> 04:32:29,210
Yeah, come on.

5737
04:32:29,390 --> 04:32:30,070
Follow me, buddy.

5738
04:32:31,250 --> 04:32:31,910
All right.

5739
04:32:32,470 --> 04:32:33,110
Take your time.

5740
04:32:33,250 --> 04:32:34,130
Take your sweet old time.

5741
04:32:34,410 --> 04:32:34,970
That's fine, too.

5742
04:32:36,050 --> 04:32:36,450
Come on.

5743
04:32:36,670 --> 04:32:37,490
I need help.

5744
04:32:37,950 --> 04:32:38,450
I need help.

5745
04:32:49,710 --> 04:32:50,590
I know.

5746
04:32:51,350 --> 04:32:52,030
All right.

5747
04:32:52,850 --> 04:32:54,290
What's going on in here?

5748
04:32:59,480 --> 04:33:01,020
Oh, wait.

5749
04:33:01,260 --> 04:33:02,500
Oh, I'm back here.

5750
04:33:02,500 --> 04:33:02,560
Sure.

5751
04:33:03,940 --> 04:33:09,850
Then, um... Ouch.

5752
04:33:15,490 --> 04:33:15,970
Okay.

5753
04:33:18,450 --> 04:33:21,230
Uh, do I need him to unlock that, too?

5754
04:33:22,650 --> 04:33:23,550
I think so.

5755
04:33:24,090 --> 04:33:25,110
Go back for Barney.

5756
04:33:25,250 --> 04:33:25,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5757
04:33:26,150 --> 04:33:27,070
Come on, Barney.

5758
04:33:28,070 --> 04:33:28,550
Yes?

5759
04:33:28,730 --> 04:33:28,910
Okay.

5760
04:33:30,510 --> 04:33:32,850
Yeah, we might stand a better chance if you're team up.

5761
04:33:32,850 --> 04:33:34,290
Yeah, exactly.

5762
04:33:36,730 --> 04:33:37,890
Come on, Barney.

5763
04:33:40,670 --> 04:33:42,870
I'm afraid of what's around this corner.

5764
04:33:44,190 --> 04:33:44,870
Okay.

5765
04:33:45,250 --> 04:33:45,770
You're safe?

5766
04:33:46,170 --> 04:33:46,870
All right, buddy.

5767
04:33:47,210 --> 04:33:47,770
I need help.

5768
04:33:49,710 --> 04:33:50,810
Open her up.

5769
04:33:53,290 --> 04:33:54,390
I'm ready.

5770
04:33:55,610 --> 04:33:56,090
Oh.

5771
04:33:56,590 --> 04:33:57,350
Oh.

5772
04:33:57,850 --> 04:33:58,770
It's this door.

5773
04:33:59,950 --> 04:34:01,210
Thanks, Barney.

5774
04:34:03,930 --> 04:34:04,790
Thank you.

5775
04:34:05,610 --> 04:34:06,390
See you later.

5776
04:34:08,050 --> 04:34:09,130
Don't die on me.

5777
04:34:35,030 --> 04:34:36,270
Oh, there he is.

5778
04:34:38,450 --> 04:34:39,950
Oh, I thought the cha...

5779
04:34:39,950 --> 04:34:43,150
Did I get one guide about the chapter being almost done?

5780
04:34:45,270 --> 04:34:46,230
Oh, gosh.

5781
04:34:51,150 --> 04:34:51,830
Hold on.

5782
04:34:52,830 --> 04:34:53,670
Wait, can he see me?

5783
04:35:10,190 --> 04:35:11,130
Did that even hit?

5784
04:35:11,250 --> 04:35:12,070
I don't know, actually.

5785
04:35:14,310 --> 04:35:15,510
The gun doesn't work?

5786
04:35:16,830 --> 04:35:18,010
Why doesn't it work?

5787
04:35:19,890 --> 04:35:21,370
It ends once I kill it.

5788
04:35:21,550 --> 04:35:21,990
Oh, great.

5789
04:35:26,000 --> 04:35:26,720
Love that.

5790
04:35:54,880 --> 04:35:55,980
I can just run?

5791
04:35:56,240 --> 04:35:56,420
Okay.

5792
04:35:56,980 --> 04:35:57,720
We'll do that.

5793
04:35:59,540 --> 04:36:00,300
I'm gonna...

5794
04:36:00,300 --> 04:36:01,320
I'm gonna have...

5795
04:36:01,320 --> 04:36:03,120
I'm gonna hold on to our little buddy for good luck.

5796
04:36:10,200 --> 04:36:11,640
Do I need the trigger room?

5797
04:36:13,000 --> 04:36:13,920
Whoop!

5798
04:36:17,780 --> 04:36:18,820
I'm running!

5799
04:36:27,030 --> 04:36:28,430
This guy...

5800
04:36:28,430 --> 04:36:29,870
Is just holding on.

5801
04:36:30,990 --> 04:36:31,770
Oh.

5802
04:36:32,110 --> 04:36:32,730
Wait.

5803
04:36:32,970 --> 04:36:33,710
It didn't bounce me.

5804
04:36:35,110 --> 04:36:36,810
It doesn't bounce me.

5805
04:36:37,370 --> 04:36:38,030
Uh-oh.

5806
04:36:43,960 --> 04:36:44,840
I am jumping.

5807
04:36:44,960 --> 04:36:45,960
Oh, there we go.

5808
04:36:53,730 --> 04:36:54,670
Oh my god.

5809
04:37:26,340 --> 04:37:35,560
I'm running and running and running and running and running and running... I did it!

5810
04:37:35,840 --> 04:37:36,460
First try!

5811
04:38:07,460 --> 04:38:11,840
Okay, that guy is... Oh shoot, where is he?

5812
04:38:12,380 --> 04:38:14,160
Wait, I don't even know where I am.

5813
04:38:14,300 --> 04:38:14,680
Okay, hold on.

5814
04:38:23,400 --> 04:38:24,480
There he is!

5815
04:38:25,260 --> 04:38:25,960
Okay, cool.

5816
04:38:26,260 --> 04:38:27,220
He doesn't know I'm here though.

5817
04:38:28,080 --> 04:38:29,080
I'm in the middle.

5818
04:38:29,740 --> 04:38:30,260
Okay.

5819
04:38:30,740 --> 04:38:31,860
And so is he.

5820
04:38:39,980 --> 04:38:42,200
He's like in the perfect position right now.

5821
04:38:43,260 --> 04:38:45,900
I think if I move it down a little...

5822
04:38:47,980 --> 04:38:49,020
Like that...

5823
04:38:50,840 --> 04:38:53,560
The round thing is this... There's a couple round things!

5824
04:38:54,280 --> 04:38:56,880
I... Okay, let me... I wish... Okay, hold on.

5825
04:38:57,000 --> 04:38:58,240
I'm here, right?

5826
04:38:58,240 --> 04:39:00,860
I... I jumped into... I jumped on from this...

5827
04:39:00,860 --> 04:39:02,120
To... Into here.

5828
04:39:02,500 --> 04:39:03,580
Oh wait, or I'm here.

5829
04:39:04,240 --> 04:39:04,640
Wait.

5830
04:39:07,500 --> 04:39:09,120
So I think this should be it.

5831
04:39:16,430 --> 04:39:16,870
Oh!

5832
04:39:17,070 --> 04:39:18,290
He ran right into it!

5833
04:39:18,390 --> 04:39:19,290
Oh, he's angry now?

5834
04:39:19,490 --> 04:39:20,310
Oh, I messed up.

5835
04:39:39,180 --> 04:39:39,900
Okay.

5836
04:39:40,660 --> 04:39:41,220
Okay.

5837
04:39:42,000 --> 04:39:42,720
Alright.

5838
04:39:43,420 --> 04:39:44,140
Well...

5839
04:39:44,140 --> 04:39:45,640
Oh, I see it!

5840
04:39:45,760 --> 04:39:46,680
It's like right there.

5841
04:39:46,900 --> 04:39:47,480
Okay, okay, okay.

5842
04:39:48,000 --> 04:39:49,660
And then...

5843
04:39:50,420 --> 04:39:51,140
There.

5844
04:39:56,930 --> 04:39:58,050
It's like that.

5845
04:40:00,690 --> 04:40:01,410
Okay.

5846
04:40:01,410 --> 04:40:01,490
Okay.

5847
04:40:08,200 --> 04:40:09,800
Are you kidding me?

5848
04:40:12,800 --> 04:40:13,440
World's weakest!

5849
04:40:15,220 --> 04:40:15,900
Nope.

5850
04:40:18,480 --> 04:40:19,540
I didn't have the homing on.

5851
04:40:24,640 --> 04:40:25,320
Oh.

5852
04:40:28,880 --> 04:40:29,560
Oh.

5853
04:40:31,520 --> 04:40:32,140
Oh.

5854
04:40:45,720 --> 04:40:47,440
I don't think...

5855
04:40:48,060 --> 04:40:50,460
I think if I move, he'll...

5856
04:40:52,640 --> 04:40:53,680
Okay, okay.

5857
04:40:54,200 --> 04:40:54,760
Okay.

5858
04:40:55,260 --> 04:40:55,660
Uh...

5859
04:40:55,660 --> 04:40:55,940
Alright.

5860
04:40:57,300 --> 04:40:58,860
More like that, maybe.

5861
04:41:00,200 --> 04:41:02,240
But he like, ends up moving...

5862
04:41:06,320 --> 04:41:08,160
Can you even one-shot him?

5863
04:41:08,360 --> 04:41:08,780
I don't know.

5864
04:41:09,240 --> 04:41:10,300
You have unlimited shots?

5865
04:41:10,560 --> 04:41:11,020
Okay, okay.

5866
04:41:11,360 --> 04:41:12,600
I'm just gonna keep going then.

5867
04:41:19,670 --> 04:41:20,190
Oh!

5868
04:41:21,950 --> 04:41:22,470
Yippee!

5869
04:41:22,890 --> 04:41:23,130
Okay.

5870
04:41:23,450 --> 04:41:24,270
I got him.

5871
04:41:24,590 --> 04:41:24,870
Yeah!

5872
04:41:27,040 --> 04:41:27,860
Alright, okay.

5873
04:41:28,120 --> 04:41:28,460
Nice.

5874
04:41:28,840 --> 04:41:29,660
Uh, that was good.

5875
04:41:29,960 --> 04:41:30,820
Good job, team.

5876
04:41:33,340 --> 04:41:33,860
Yeah!

5877
04:41:34,840 --> 04:41:35,360
Okay!

5878
04:41:35,360 --> 04:41:35,560
Yay!

5879
04:41:36,620 --> 04:41:37,180
Uh...

5880
04:41:37,180 --> 04:41:37,700
Now where?

5881
04:41:37,960 --> 04:41:38,320
Two?

5882
04:41:39,760 --> 04:41:40,320
Oh...

5883
04:41:40,320 --> 04:41:41,140
Uh...

5884
04:41:43,440 --> 04:41:44,000
Uh...

5885
04:41:45,800 --> 04:41:46,360
Um...

5886
04:41:46,360 --> 04:41:48,540
Back from where he came, I guess.

5887
04:41:50,540 --> 04:41:51,320
I guess.

5888
04:41:55,170 --> 04:41:56,850
Oh, I gotta destroy the walls.

5889
04:41:57,190 --> 04:41:58,470
I gotta blow on more things?

5890
04:41:58,850 --> 04:41:59,790
Oh, like these?

5891
04:42:00,030 --> 04:42:00,290
Okay.

5892
04:42:03,770 --> 04:42:04,250
Okay.

5893
04:42:04,250 --> 04:42:04,550
What...

5894
04:42:04,550 --> 04:42:06,210
What is back where he was at anyway?

5895
04:42:08,590 --> 04:42:09,310
Oh, no.

5896
04:42:09,730 --> 04:42:10,350
Oh, no.

5897
04:42:10,430 --> 04:42:11,030
I messed up.

5898
04:42:15,820 --> 04:42:16,580
Thank you, yeah.

5899
04:42:16,920 --> 04:42:17,140
Okay.

5900
04:42:17,900 --> 04:42:19,560
Like, that wall right...

5901
04:42:19,560 --> 04:42:20,220
Okay, okay.

5902
04:42:20,380 --> 04:42:21,580
Oh, and the towers.

5903
04:42:23,280 --> 04:42:23,760
Okay.

5904
04:42:25,460 --> 04:42:25,940
Um...

5905
04:42:25,940 --> 04:42:27,660
Does that thing then need to be blown up?

5906
04:42:27,800 --> 04:42:28,780
Stop wiggling!

5907
04:42:28,780 --> 04:42:29,340
Gosh!

5908
04:42:33,280 --> 04:42:34,860
Does this need to be blown up?

5909
04:42:35,540 --> 04:42:36,780
Oh, dang it, you...

5910
04:42:41,600 --> 04:42:42,040
Blow!

5911
04:42:46,940 --> 04:42:47,980
Okay, I guess not.

5912
04:42:48,180 --> 04:42:48,300
Okay.

5913
04:42:55,680 --> 04:42:56,600
That should be good.

5914
04:42:58,740 --> 04:42:59,180
Just

5915
04:43:02,370 --> 04:43:02,550
kidding.

5916
04:43:02,550 --> 04:43:03,230
Oh...

5917
04:43:03,230 --> 04:43:03,530
Ow!

5918
04:43:03,970 --> 04:43:04,130
Ow!

5919
04:43:04,570 --> 04:43:04,670
Ow!

5920
04:43:08,410 --> 04:43:09,150
Uh...

5921
04:43:10,150 --> 04:43:11,260
Like that...

5922
04:43:11,870 --> 04:43:13,070
Oh my gosh!

5923
04:43:15,690 --> 04:43:17,490
I have to blow up that thing?

5924
04:43:29,930 --> 04:43:31,190
There we go!

5925
04:43:31,410 --> 04:43:32,290
Oh my gosh!

5926
04:43:36,950 --> 04:43:38,130
And you.

5927
04:43:38,510 --> 04:43:38,870
Okay.

5928
04:43:39,150 --> 04:43:39,390
Alright.

5929
04:43:41,410 --> 04:43:43,390
He's shaking so much.

5930
04:43:45,430 --> 04:43:46,050
Oh!

5931
04:43:46,370 --> 04:43:46,530
Oh!

5932
04:43:46,750 --> 04:43:47,010
Oh!

5933
04:43:47,390 --> 04:43:47,830
Lucky, lucky.

5934
04:43:48,130 --> 04:43:48,710
Okay, nice.

5935
04:43:49,070 --> 04:43:49,710
And then...

5936
04:43:49,710 --> 04:43:51,230
That thing I gotta blow up?

5937
04:43:55,270 --> 04:43:55,690
Bye!

5938
04:43:56,010 --> 04:43:56,790
Happy birthday!

5939
04:43:57,550 --> 04:43:58,270
Happy, happy birthday!

5940
04:44:04,020 --> 04:44:05,520
Yes, to make a bridge.

5941
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:09,900
Oh...

5942
04:44:11,020 --> 04:44:11,640
Interesting.

5943
04:44:16,080 --> 04:44:17,200
Is it this?

5944
04:44:23,600 --> 04:44:24,220
Close.

5945
04:44:28,600 --> 04:44:30,320
Break everything.

5946
04:44:30,320 --> 04:44:30,460
Break everything.

5947
04:44:37,290 --> 04:44:37,820
Alright.

5948
04:44:39,220 --> 04:44:40,940
That should be all of it, no?

5949
04:44:42,820 --> 04:44:43,720
Nice.

5950
04:44:45,100 --> 04:44:46,240
The wall?

5951
04:44:49,250 --> 04:44:50,260
And a...

5952
04:44:50,260 --> 04:44:51,200
And a wall.

5953
04:44:51,780 --> 04:44:52,420
Which...

5954
04:44:52,420 --> 04:44:53,000
A wall?

5955
04:44:53,640 --> 04:44:54,560
The wall?

5956
04:44:54,980 --> 04:44:55,000
The wall.

5957
04:44:55,000 --> 04:44:55,800
Break the other wall.

5958
04:44:57,040 --> 04:44:58,140
Which wall?

5959
04:44:59,020 --> 04:44:59,660
The...

5960
04:44:59,660 --> 04:45:00,520
Oh, that wall!

5961
04:45:00,800 --> 04:45:01,420
Oh...

5962
04:45:01,420 --> 04:45:01,860
Okay, okay.

5963
04:45:03,560 --> 04:45:04,840
This wall...

5964
04:45:12,500 --> 04:45:13,780
She shoots...

5965
04:45:13,780 --> 04:45:15,100
And she scores.

5966
04:45:15,840 --> 04:45:17,820
I don't know why I'm so bad...

5967
04:45:17,820 --> 04:45:19,260
At determining this.

5968
04:45:20,360 --> 04:45:20,940
I just...

5969
04:45:20,940 --> 04:45:21,980
Disorder my Mint Wipocop.

5970
04:45:22,080 --> 04:45:22,820
Thank you, Ron!

5971
04:45:23,300 --> 04:45:23,940
Thank you!

5972
04:45:24,440 --> 04:45:25,420
There we go!

5973
04:45:25,660 --> 04:45:26,860
Okay, okay, okay.

5974
04:45:27,560 --> 04:45:29,380
I was gonna say, why...

5975
04:45:29,920 --> 04:45:31,240
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

5976
04:45:31,340 --> 04:45:31,920
I was like...

5977
04:45:31,920 --> 04:45:35,020
Oh, maybe there's something I need to jump over here and then walk around.

5978
04:45:35,020 --> 04:45:36,200
I didn't realize that.

5979
04:45:36,400 --> 04:45:36,980
I couldn't...

5980
04:45:36,980 --> 04:45:38,240
Get to it from there.

5981
04:45:38,400 --> 04:45:38,600
Okay.

5982
04:47:29,440 --> 04:47:31,200
Maybe they've made an autosave?

5983
04:47:31,200 --> 04:47:31,780
Let's see.

5984
04:47:51,940 --> 04:47:53,060
It blows in...

5985
04:47:53,060 --> 04:47:54,480
I can't aim for the water, you guys.

5986
04:47:54,720 --> 04:47:55,120
It...

5987
04:47:55,120 --> 04:47:55,720
Shoots me...

5988
04:47:55,720 --> 04:47:57,040
It shoots me in.

5989
04:47:58,500 --> 04:47:59,020
It...

5990
04:48:00,580 --> 04:48:01,840
It shoots me...

5991
04:48:01,840 --> 04:48:02,380
Every time.

5992
04:48:11,000 --> 04:48:11,900
Crouch in the corner.

5993
04:48:12,160 --> 04:48:13,820
I gotta get to the corner first, buddy.

5994
04:48:24,260 --> 04:48:24,780
Maybe...

5995
04:48:35,660 --> 04:48:37,300
Classic Half-Life experience.

5996
04:48:38,200 --> 04:48:39,440
They tell you...

5997
04:48:39,440 --> 04:48:40,320
They tell you...

5998
04:48:40,320 --> 04:48:41,320
They tell you...

5999
04:48:41,320 --> 04:48:42,320
I get...

6000
04:48:42,320 --> 04:48:44,140
I get yelled at if I save scum.

6001
04:48:44,240 --> 04:48:46,280
I get yelled at if I don't save scum.

6002
04:48:46,420 --> 04:48:48,500
I can't make everybody happy!

6003
04:48:51,220 --> 04:48:51,740
People...

6004
04:48:51,740 --> 04:48:54,240
People in the comments are just like, She saves too much!

6005
04:48:54,360 --> 04:48:56,580
People in the comments, She doesn't save enough!

6006
04:48:57,360 --> 04:48:58,500
There's no winning!

6007
04:49:36,970 --> 04:49:38,390
Anyway, thank you, guys.

6008
04:49:40,170 --> 04:49:43,230
I'll compromise by aiming to make everyone unhappy.

6009
04:49:43,910 --> 04:49:44,110
Yeah!

6010
04:49:45,070 --> 04:49:45,470
My...

6011
04:49:45,470 --> 04:49:45,770
That's...

6012
04:49:45,770 --> 04:49:46,270
That's how...

6013
04:49:46,270 --> 04:49:48,010
That's my optimal gameplay style.

6014
04:49:48,110 --> 04:49:50,590
To just piss people off as much as possible.

6015
04:49:54,610 --> 04:49:55,850
Ducky, thank you for the...

6016
04:49:55,850 --> 04:49:56,730
Thank you, guys!

6017
04:49:56,990 --> 04:49:58,190
For the stream!

6018
04:50:00,570 --> 04:50:02,270
Oh my goodness!

6019
04:50:02,670 --> 04:50:04,370
Wait, how long have I been going for?

6020
04:50:05,290 --> 04:50:06,130
Oh my gosh!

6021
04:50:06,230 --> 04:50:07,290
Almost five hours now!

6022
04:50:07,430 --> 04:50:07,650
Wow!

6023
04:50:08,530 --> 04:50:10,270
I didn't expect to play for so long.

6024
04:50:10,470 --> 04:50:12,350
Dorko, thank you so much for the peek!

6025
04:50:14,930 --> 04:50:16,750
I meant it as a compliment.

6026
04:50:16,990 --> 04:50:17,790
Thank you!

6027
04:50:19,510 --> 04:50:23,950
Wishing you a brain fog-free relaxing 10 out of 10 today.

6028
04:50:24,110 --> 04:50:24,550
Thank you!

6029
04:50:27,830 --> 04:50:29,550
You did it, I always believed.

6030
04:50:29,850 --> 04:50:33,810
No matter how bleak it seems, somehow I always make it out, huh?

6031
04:50:36,970 --> 04:50:39,070
How many more chapters do we have?

6032
04:50:39,070 --> 04:50:39,570
Let me see.

6033
04:50:40,970 --> 04:50:41,570
Uh...

6034
04:50:42,410 --> 04:50:43,010
Hmm...

6035
04:50:43,010 --> 04:50:43,270
Huh?

6036
04:50:43,870 --> 04:50:45,070
Five chapters.

6037
04:50:45,450 --> 04:50:48,070
I looked it up earlier to see where we were at, but like...

6038
04:50:49,030 --> 04:50:49,630
Uh...

6039
04:50:49,630 --> 04:50:52,510
One, two, three, four, five, six!

6040
04:50:52,830 --> 04:50:53,250
Seven?

6041
04:50:53,530 --> 04:50:54,710
Seven chapters left?

6042
04:51:02,100 --> 04:51:04,480
You're like 75% through the game.

6043
04:51:04,720 --> 04:51:06,080
So we might...

6044
04:51:08,260 --> 04:51:10,140
Be able to...

6045
04:51:10,140 --> 04:51:12,060
Beat it next week?

6046
04:51:13,600 --> 04:51:14,860
This chapter was the longest.

6047
04:51:15,080 --> 04:51:15,980
You're about two thirds in.

6048
04:51:16,160 --> 04:51:16,320
Okay.

6049
04:51:17,740 --> 04:51:19,780
Took me about two and a half hours from this point.

6050
04:51:19,920 --> 04:51:20,080
Oh!

6051
04:51:20,360 --> 04:51:20,940
Okay, okay, okay.

6052
04:51:21,860 --> 04:51:22,740
Rafa, welcome to membership.

6053
04:51:22,920 --> 04:51:23,540
Thank you, Apache!

6054
04:51:23,900 --> 04:51:24,460
Thank you for the...

6055
04:51:24,460 --> 04:51:24,880
Thank you for the...

6056
04:51:24,880 --> 04:51:25,360
Thank you!

6057
04:51:29,000 --> 04:51:29,360
Hmm...

6058
04:51:29,360 --> 04:51:30,400
One more long stream.

6059
04:51:32,020 --> 04:51:32,380
Hmm...

6060
04:51:32,380 --> 04:51:33,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.

6061
04:51:35,340 --> 04:51:39,220
You got past the longest, hardest chapter of the game and got out of the death loop.

6062
04:51:39,440 --> 04:51:40,200
Proud of you, Vito.

6063
04:51:40,340 --> 04:51:40,940
Thank you!

6064
04:51:42,500 --> 04:51:43,080
Thank you!

6065
04:51:43,080 --> 04:51:43,500
Thank you!

6066
04:51:46,160 --> 04:51:48,600
The last few chapters are pretty short.

6067
04:51:48,840 --> 04:51:48,960
Okay!

6068
04:51:49,300 --> 04:51:50,120
Three to four hours?

6069
04:51:50,220 --> 04:51:51,240
That's totally easy!

6070
04:51:53,460 --> 04:51:53,940
Yeah!

6071
04:51:55,240 --> 04:51:57,400
Maybe two more streams or a long one.

6072
04:51:57,460 --> 04:51:57,700
Oh yeah!

6073
04:51:57,880 --> 04:51:58,920
I think if...

6074
04:51:58,920 --> 04:52:01,420
We could do like this length, I think we could do it.

6075
04:52:02,680 --> 04:52:03,060
Austinaria!

6076
04:52:03,520 --> 04:52:04,640
Thank you so much for the fun gift!

6077
04:52:04,780 --> 04:52:05,480
Thank you so much!

6078
04:52:05,580 --> 04:52:06,120
Thank you!

6079
04:52:06,540 --> 04:52:07,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6080
04:52:10,340 --> 04:52:11,580
That was the hardest part?

6081
04:52:11,740 --> 04:52:11,880
What?

6082
04:52:12,380 --> 04:52:12,760
Seriously?

6083
04:52:14,800 --> 04:52:16,200
Just got your gamersubs merch.

6084
04:52:16,340 --> 04:52:17,340
Thank you, Onyx!

6085
04:52:17,460 --> 04:52:17,960
Thank you!

6086
04:52:19,720 --> 04:52:21,020
Everybody's saying different times.

6087
04:52:21,220 --> 04:52:21,740
I think...

6088
04:52:21,740 --> 04:52:23,180
As long as it's not like...

6089
04:52:23,180 --> 04:52:26,180
To me, a long stream is like seven, eight hours.

6090
04:52:26,420 --> 04:52:26,940
Nine hours.

6091
04:52:28,640 --> 04:52:33,620
If we're like five hours, I think we can easy peasy do it.

6092
04:52:34,620 --> 04:52:35,260
Yeah.

6093
04:52:36,410 --> 04:52:37,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6094
04:52:38,060 --> 04:52:38,680
So...

6095
04:52:38,680 --> 04:52:39,400
Twenty hours.

6096
04:52:40,040 --> 04:52:42,960
Fifteen hundred hours!

6097
04:52:44,920 --> 04:52:46,690
Seventy five...

6098
04:52:47,280 --> 04:52:47,840
Four...

6099
04:52:47,840 --> 04:52:49,020
Hundred...

6100
04:52:49,020 --> 04:52:49,900
Bajillion...

6101
04:52:49,900 --> 04:52:50,620
Million...

6102
04:52:51,140 --> 04:52:53,620
Never ending hours.

6103
04:52:56,330 --> 04:52:57,740
So many hours.

6104
04:52:58,300 --> 04:52:59,140
Fukuro, thank you!

6105
04:52:59,700 --> 04:53:00,080
Wait...

6106
04:53:02,280 --> 04:53:02,920
Hundred...

6107
04:53:02,920 --> 04:53:04,220
X plus one hour.

6108
04:53:04,440 --> 04:53:04,580
Yeah.

6109
04:53:05,240 --> 04:53:06,800
Sixty nine, four twenty hours.

6110
04:53:06,960 --> 04:53:08,740
Four twenty, sixty nine hours.

6111
04:53:08,960 --> 04:53:10,480
Now you guys are being ridiculous.

6112
04:53:11,060 --> 04:53:11,480
I'm getting...

6113
04:53:11,480 --> 04:53:11,940
I'm getting...

6114
04:53:11,940 --> 04:53:14,180
I'm getting one guide in the chat.

6115
04:53:14,840 --> 04:53:17,080
How many hours it's gonna take me...

6116
04:53:17,820 --> 04:53:18,460
To...

6117
04:53:18,460 --> 04:53:19,780
To beat the game.

6118
04:53:22,500 --> 04:53:23,780
Fibonacci hours.

6119
04:53:26,420 --> 04:53:27,380
Solve this...

6120
04:53:27,760 --> 04:53:29,120
Solve this riddle.

6121
04:53:30,760 --> 04:53:31,640
Riddle me this.

6122
04:53:32,720 --> 04:53:35,300
How many hours does it take...

6123
04:53:35,300 --> 04:53:35,940
To...

6124
04:53:35,940 --> 04:53:37,240
Have a monkey...

6125
04:53:37,240 --> 04:53:38,500
Change a lightbulb.

6126
04:53:39,760 --> 04:53:41,740
And that is your answer.

6127
04:53:43,260 --> 04:53:45,560
Means it's getting shorter for stream.

6128
04:53:47,860 --> 04:53:49,200
Thirty minutes tops.

6129
04:53:49,740 --> 04:53:50,000
Yeah.

6130
04:53:50,220 --> 04:53:50,920
What is the...

6131
04:53:50,920 --> 04:53:51,980
I'm so curious.

6132
04:53:52,160 --> 04:53:52,800
What is the...

6133
04:53:52,800 --> 04:53:53,960
I wanna see a speed...

6134
04:53:53,960 --> 04:53:55,520
Speed run of this game now.

6135
04:53:55,960 --> 04:53:56,480
Actually.

6136
04:53:58,160 --> 04:53:59,500
I want to see a speed run.

6137
04:54:01,540 --> 04:54:04,020
Can you unpause and just press W into that room?

6138
04:54:04,180 --> 04:54:04,380
Sure.

6139
04:54:04,960 --> 04:54:06,560
Let's see what we're in for next week.

6140
04:54:12,790 --> 04:54:13,210
Oh.

6141
04:54:13,890 --> 04:54:14,310
Oh.

6142
04:54:14,770 --> 04:54:14,890
Oh.

6143
04:54:19,030 --> 04:54:19,930
It literally...

6144
04:54:19,930 --> 04:54:21,250
It literally breached my toes.

6145
04:54:22,570 --> 04:54:25,840
My toes didn't die.

6146
04:54:28,020 --> 04:54:28,840
Falling rocks.

6147
04:54:29,020 --> 04:54:29,140
Okay.

6148
04:54:29,300 --> 04:54:30,920
That's the next thing that we remember.

6149
04:54:32,000 --> 04:54:32,440
Where are you?

6150
04:54:32,700 --> 04:54:33,480
For this chapter?

6151
04:54:34,260 --> 04:54:35,640
Run baby run.

6152
04:54:36,520 --> 04:54:37,640
In the next episode.

6153
04:54:37,880 --> 04:54:37,960
Yeah.

6154
04:54:38,040 --> 04:54:38,620
That was your preview.

6155
04:54:38,620 --> 04:54:40,060
That was your next episode preview.

6156
04:54:43,400 --> 04:54:44,940
Next episode preview baby.

6157
04:54:47,000 --> 04:54:48,000
Thirteen of nineteen.

6158
04:54:48,340 --> 04:54:48,520
Wait.

6159
04:54:48,740 --> 04:54:49,620
But the...

6160
04:54:50,740 --> 04:54:51,620
But the...

6161
04:54:51,620 --> 04:54:52,680
I'm on the...

6162
04:54:52,680 --> 04:54:53,720
The fandom.

6163
04:54:54,060 --> 04:54:54,520
The wiki.

6164
04:54:54,820 --> 04:54:56,540
It says Endgame is 20.

6165
04:54:59,220 --> 04:54:59,660
So...

6166
04:54:59,660 --> 04:55:01,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

6167
04:55:01,200 --> 04:55:01,560
Just kidding.

6168
04:55:01,840 --> 04:55:03,780
Chapter 18 and then Endgame is chapter 19.

6169
04:55:03,960 --> 04:55:04,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

6170
04:55:04,880 --> 04:55:05,060
Sorry.

6171
04:55:05,060 --> 04:55:06,380
I was looking at the...

6172
04:55:06,940 --> 04:55:09,720
At the table of contents and not the chapter number.

6173
04:55:10,200 --> 04:55:11,020
Okay, cool.

6174
04:55:13,380 --> 04:55:15,760
World record for this whole game is like 20 minutes.

6175
04:55:23,660 --> 04:55:24,220
Like...

6176
04:55:24,220 --> 04:55:24,740
What?

6177
04:55:26,120 --> 04:55:26,680
You...

6178
04:55:28,280 --> 04:55:29,880
Endgame is cutscene credits.

6179
04:55:30,040 --> 04:55:32,500
Oh, but I thought this game didn't have cutscenes.

6180
04:55:36,040 --> 04:55:37,180
Oh, okay, cool.

6181
04:55:42,000 --> 04:55:44,160
20 minutes and 41 seconds.

6182
04:55:44,600 --> 04:55:45,220
What's a...

6183
04:55:46,220 --> 04:55:46,940
Oh, TAS.

6184
04:55:47,040 --> 04:55:47,900
Is it a TAS run?

6185
04:55:48,060 --> 04:55:48,960
Or is it...

6186
04:55:50,200 --> 04:55:51,260
Is it like...

6187
04:55:51,260 --> 04:55:52,140
Real...

6188
04:55:52,140 --> 04:55:52,380
People.

6189
04:55:57,660 --> 04:55:59,880
Half-Life 1 in 20 minutes.

6190
04:56:00,180 --> 04:56:01,560
TAS is shorter?

6191
04:56:03,180 --> 04:56:03,520
What?

6192
04:56:03,860 --> 04:56:04,920
Oh my god.

6193
04:56:06,000 --> 04:56:07,100
Glitch allowed probably.

6194
04:56:07,320 --> 04:56:07,880
Yeah, it has to be.

6195
04:56:08,040 --> 04:56:08,200
No?

6196
04:56:08,980 --> 04:56:10,040
Probably some skipping tech.

6197
04:56:10,160 --> 04:56:10,780
It has to be.

6198
04:56:10,860 --> 04:56:11,540
It has to be.

6199
04:56:11,940 --> 04:56:14,060
There's no way you could get here in 20 minutes.

6200
04:56:14,700 --> 04:56:15,800
There's no way.

6201
04:56:17,480 --> 04:56:18,880
I wanna know without...

6202
04:56:19,380 --> 04:56:19,940
Without...

6203
04:56:19,940 --> 04:56:20,780
Without glitches.

6204
04:56:24,820 --> 04:56:26,520
25 minutes is the art...

6205
04:56:26,520 --> 04:56:27,340
No way!

6206
04:56:28,860 --> 04:56:29,820
No way!

6207
04:56:30,120 --> 04:56:31,560
Speedrunners find a way.

6208
04:56:33,360 --> 04:56:36,120
The game is really broken so it has a lot of skips.

6209
04:56:36,120 --> 04:56:37,700
It reminds me of like Pokemon.

6210
04:56:37,980 --> 04:56:41,160
Original Pokemon is just being held by duct tape, you know?

6211
04:56:43,180 --> 04:56:44,560
But it's so crazy.

6212
04:56:45,800 --> 04:56:49,400
I feel like I played a lot of like...

6213
04:56:50,040 --> 04:56:51,440
Original Pokemon...

6214
04:56:52,120 --> 04:56:53,380
As a kid, right?

6215
04:56:53,660 --> 04:56:54,040
Like...

6216
04:56:54,040 --> 04:56:55,740
And I tried all sorts of things.

6217
04:56:55,740 --> 04:56:56,840
And...

6218
04:56:56,840 --> 04:56:59,360
Never once did my game glitch.

6219
04:56:59,620 --> 04:56:59,800
Ever.

6220
04:57:00,140 --> 04:57:02,560
I tried to get like a missing no and stuff.

6221
04:57:02,760 --> 04:57:03,020
Never!

6222
04:57:03,240 --> 04:57:05,220
Ever did my game ever glitch.

6223
04:57:06,780 --> 04:57:08,100
What did I do right?

6224
04:57:10,400 --> 04:57:12,080
I never had anything.

6225
04:57:14,520 --> 04:57:15,580
Oh, yeah.

6226
04:57:15,800 --> 04:57:16,660
Thank you, Papilla.

6227
04:57:17,060 --> 04:57:17,100
Yeah.

6228
04:57:17,560 --> 04:57:19,260
Task Tool Assisted Speedrun.

6229
04:57:19,800 --> 04:57:20,560
Basically...

6230
04:57:20,560 --> 04:57:21,420
Is having...

6231
04:57:21,420 --> 04:57:22,000
I like...

6232
04:57:22,000 --> 04:57:22,720
Oh, gosh.

6233
04:57:22,860 --> 04:57:23,480
Well, I don't...

6234
04:57:23,480 --> 04:57:24,460
Sometimes...

6235
04:57:24,460 --> 04:57:28,720
I watch like Mario task runs because they're kind of fascinating.

6236
04:57:29,440 --> 04:57:30,300
Where it's like...

6237
04:57:30,300 --> 04:57:31,060
How...

6238
04:57:31,060 --> 04:57:32,160
How...

6239
04:57:32,160 --> 04:57:33,360
Crazy...

6240
04:57:33,360 --> 04:57:34,740
They can get...

6241
04:57:34,740 --> 04:57:37,300
How much more precision they...

6242
04:57:37,300 --> 04:57:38,540
They find.

6243
04:57:38,540 --> 04:57:39,600
It's so crazy.

6244
04:57:41,060 --> 04:57:43,400
I got missing no in Pokemon Red.

6245
04:57:43,800 --> 04:57:45,360
I came too hard.

6246
04:57:45,660 --> 04:57:45,840
Truly!

6247
04:57:50,140 --> 04:57:50,780
Oh...

6248
04:57:50,780 --> 04:57:52,240
Brain Age task?

6249
04:57:52,420 --> 04:57:53,300
I haven't watched that one.

6250
04:57:53,400 --> 04:57:54,300
I'll have to watch it.

6251
04:57:56,380 --> 04:57:59,560
Half-Life in .5A presses.

6252
04:57:59,560 --> 04:58:00,460
Hahaha.

6253
04:58:02,240 --> 04:58:03,200
Turururu puru.

6254
04:58:04,700 --> 04:58:05,660
Turururu puru.

6255
04:58:05,660 --> 04:58:05,760
Turururu puru.

6256
04:58:06,720 --> 04:58:07,060
Turururu puru.

6257
04:58:07,060 --> 04:58:07,080
Hmm.

6258
04:58:08,460 --> 04:58:09,000
But yeah.

6259
04:58:09,240 --> 04:58:09,820
Thank you guys!

6260
04:58:10,760 --> 04:58:11,420
Night-night Minto.

6261
04:58:11,660 --> 04:58:11,800
Goodnight!

6262
04:58:12,460 --> 04:58:14,080
Thank you for hanging out with me.

6263
04:58:14,440 --> 04:58:15,620
Thanks for...

6264
04:58:16,900 --> 04:58:18,260
Helping me through some of these.

6265
04:58:18,440 --> 04:58:20,640
I really appreciate it when you guys are just like...

6266
04:58:20,640 --> 04:58:20,980
Minto!

6267
04:58:21,160 --> 04:58:21,560
Do this!

6268
04:58:22,160 --> 04:58:23,060
I'm like, okay!

6269
04:58:23,340 --> 04:58:23,640
Thank you!

6270
04:58:25,040 --> 04:58:26,660
So thank you for helping me out.

6271
04:58:26,740 --> 04:58:29,680
When it's like, you gotta destroy the wall and destroy this and destroy that.

6272
04:58:29,820 --> 04:58:30,920
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

6273
04:58:33,860 --> 04:58:34,280
Yes.

6274
04:58:34,740 --> 04:58:35,620
Yes, yes, yes.

6275
04:58:36,900 --> 04:58:39,320
And next time, maybe we'll beat it.

6276
04:58:39,920 --> 04:58:40,340
Maybe.

6277
04:58:41,040 --> 04:58:41,240
Maybe.

6278
04:58:41,860 --> 04:58:42,840
Surestie, thank you.

6279
04:58:43,080 --> 04:58:43,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6280
04:58:44,260 --> 04:58:45,100
It does help a lot.

6281
04:58:45,260 --> 04:58:45,980
Appreciate it.

6282
04:58:46,560 --> 04:58:47,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6283
04:58:47,460 --> 04:58:50,300
Full glitches run is 6 minutes 50 seconds.

6284
04:58:51,940 --> 04:58:56,960
Okay, if it's only 20 minutes, Ron, I'm gonna watch it right after this while I eat something.

6285
04:58:57,100 --> 04:58:57,840
Because I'm hungry.

6286
04:58:58,120 --> 04:58:59,480
Even though it's midnight for me.

6287
04:59:00,840 --> 04:59:04,260
But I eat something and then I'm gonna go to bed and then I'm gonna have crazy dreams.

6288
04:59:06,260 --> 04:59:06,620
Crazy.

6289
04:59:08,240 --> 04:59:10,100
Don't... Oh, wait, yeah, I shouldn't watch it.

6290
04:59:10,380 --> 04:59:11,240
Spoilers, you're right.

6291
04:59:11,420 --> 04:59:11,600
Okay.

6292
04:59:11,880 --> 04:59:12,500
Aw, man.

6293
04:59:12,740 --> 04:59:13,460
Okay, never mind.

6294
04:59:13,620 --> 04:59:14,760
I'll watch it next week.

6295
04:59:17,240 --> 04:59:19,460
Okay, I'll watch it next week.

6296
04:59:20,980 --> 04:59:22,740
I almost spoiled myself.

6297
04:59:23,200 --> 04:59:24,140
You were like...

6298
04:59:27,480 --> 04:59:29,220
I was like, yeah, no problem.

6299
04:59:29,420 --> 04:59:29,660
Easy.

6300
04:59:33,860 --> 04:59:34,560
Next week.

6301
04:59:34,880 --> 04:59:36,360
We'll beat it.

6302
04:59:36,480 --> 04:59:36,640
Maybe.

6303
04:59:36,960 --> 04:59:37,640
I'll try.

6304
04:59:37,780 --> 04:59:38,040
I'll try.

6305
04:59:38,180 --> 04:59:38,840
I'll do my best.

6306
04:59:39,400 --> 04:59:40,620
I'll game next week.

6307
04:59:40,740 --> 04:59:42,180
I'll game next week, you guys.

6308
04:59:42,440 --> 04:59:43,740
I will, I will, I will.

6309
04:59:44,080 --> 04:59:45,020
Anyway, otamito.

6310
04:59:45,220 --> 04:59:45,900
Thank you guys so much.

6311
04:59:46,040 --> 04:59:46,920
Thanks for hanging out.

6312
04:59:47,320 --> 04:59:49,000
And have a good rest of your day.

6313
04:59:49,200 --> 04:59:50,420
Rest of your night.

6314
04:59:50,920 --> 04:59:52,260
Now it's our fault.

6315
04:59:52,420 --> 04:59:54,140
No, it's not your fault.

6316
04:59:54,300 --> 04:59:55,120
You saved me.

6317
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:56,660
Birthday time, Mr. B.

6318
04:59:56,840 --> 04:59:57,560
Happy birthday.

6319
04:59:58,180 --> 04:59:58,960
Happy, happy birthday.

6320
04:59:59,580 --> 05:00:02,480
In memory of all the Barneys we lost along the way.

6321
05:00:03,000 --> 05:00:03,240
No.

6322
05:00:04,860 --> 05:00:08,520
See you next week for the next Otamito Healthcare Plan to Solve It.

6323
05:00:08,640 --> 05:00:09,140
Please.

6324
05:00:10,460 --> 05:00:11,920
I don't need healthcare.

6325
05:00:11,920 --> 05:00:12,780
I'm a ghost.

6326
05:00:16,840 --> 05:00:17,560
Otamito.

6327
05:00:18,440 --> 05:00:19,160
Salute.

6328
05:00:19,340 --> 05:00:23,120
