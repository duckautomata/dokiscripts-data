1
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,540
That's what was wrong.

2
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,040
I was like, why does it sound weird?

3
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,180
I had something off because I was recording earlier.

4
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,980
This song is terrible.

5
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,200
Get me out of here.

6
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,480
Get me out of here, please.

7
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,680
Guys, things are a little scuffed on my end, I'm not gonna lie.

8
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
Oh, why did the music disappear?

9
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,460
Is it because I said the music was horrible?

10
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,560
Um...

11
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,960
Uh...

12
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,640
Uh...

13
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,260
Where did the music go?

14
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,500
Where did the music go?

15
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,360
To this...

16
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,820
Stream, it's really... Look at my cursor.

17
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,100
I don't know if we're gonna make it.

18
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm gonna be honest.

19
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,700
I

20
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,270
can barely see anything.

21
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:27,870
My...

22
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,090
My window is so...

23
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,110
Tiny.

24
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,420
Kitty, good kitty!

25
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,020
Congratulations!

26
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,740
It's...

27
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,280
So itty-bitty.

28
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,020
I tried a lot.

29
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,040
I did try.

30
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,800
But we're gonna just see what happens.

31
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,580
Baby!

32
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,520
As long as you guys can see it, I guess it's fine.

33
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,060
Um...

34
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,060
See, it's working.

35
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,620
It's working.

36
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,100
Beep boop boop.

37
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,860
Beep beep boop boop boop.

38
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,950
Use your tiny monitor!

39
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,980
Wait, I probably could.

40
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,700
Um...

41
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,180
But yeah, look at the load runner.

42
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:17,960
Uh...

43
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,680
Someone was just like, Oh, I wonder if Mint ever played this game?

44
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,020
And I was like...

45
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah!

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,380
How do I take the gold?

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,760
It's me!

48
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,080
I take the gold!

49
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,200
Run.

50
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,700
How do I take the gold?

51
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Go.

52
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh!

53
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
What just happened?

54
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,960
Oh!

55
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,160
Oh!

56
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,520
Oh my god.

57
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,840
I just had like a...

58
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,420
A vision.

59
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh my god, I'm here!

60
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,220
Look at me go!

61
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,340
And then you climb up and we gotta take the gold.

62
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,400
Wait, let me move my cursor.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,400
Do we even need this?

64
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,580
Oh!

65
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,920
Wait!

66
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,600
Oh my god.

67
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,640
I guess we're taking the gold, everybody.

68
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,480
Wait, just fall down.

69
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,380
What?

70
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,620
When he falls, it's so funny.

71
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
And then there will be bad guys sometimes that like...

72
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Are scary...

73
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm not doing the most optimal...

74
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,000
Uh...

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Route for this, probably.

76
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,320
Hi!

77
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,600
Oh, there's the door!

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
I was like, how do I get out of here?

79
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,500
Wah!

80
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,300
Lord and Lord!

81
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,660
Yeah!

82
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,020
We did it!

83
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh my gosh.

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,120
How am I supposed to get down there?

85
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:46,880
Oh.

86
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,220
Wait, how do I do any of this?

87
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Wait, okay.

88
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,520
I think I can climb across this.

89
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,020
Wait.

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,340
I can't...

91
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,940
No, go down.

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Go down.

93
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,680
Okay, I can't go down.

94
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,280
It's impossible.

95
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,620
He can only climb up.

96
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,040
He's only an up man.

97
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,680
But how do I go down?

98
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,740
It's impossible.

99
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,140
Wait, I can jump?

100
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,880
What the hell was that?

101
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,120
That was so...

102
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,400
I love platforming.

103
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,380
Use your gun.

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,040
I have a gun.

105
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,580
How do I shoot?

106
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,300
Dig...

107
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,140
Diggy hole.

108
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,880
How?

109
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,240
How?

110
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,000
What's the...

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,320
What's the control for dig?

112
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,440
All I know is...

113
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,880
All I know is left and right.

114
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,040
Is there a pause?

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,780
No.

116
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,090
Oh!

117
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,130
Sticky keys.

118
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,070
No sticky keys, please!

119
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,510
Oh.

120
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,090
At least the time's not going up, right?

121
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,790
Oh.

122
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,770
That's my cursor.

123
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,750
Where did the music go?

124
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,410
Why can't I go down the stairs?

125
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,890
Or the ladder?

126
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,550
Okay, hold on.

127
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,550
Oh, shoot.

128
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,170
I did it again.

129
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:32,490
Okay.

130
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,110
Uh...

131
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,090
Wow, that is small.

132
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,370
I'm telling you!

133
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,110
I'm telling you!

134
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,570
I'm not pressing the right down.

135
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,890
Guys, this is so scuffed.

136
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,190
How did...

137
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,310
How does anyone from the 90s exist?

138
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,310
How did you guys do it?

139
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,030
How did you survive?

140
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,630
How are you alive?

141
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,670
How did you survive?

142
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,390
Manuals.

143
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,410
Okay, I'm gonna Google it.

144
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,470
That's so true.

145
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,230
What's a manual?

146
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,610
Nope.

147
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,910
Load runner.

148
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,410
Legend returns manual.

149
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Let's see what the system requirements are.

150
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,680
Macintosh.

151
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you guys have that?

152
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,920
You could play.

153
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,100
Found one of my favorite artists and music for Death Stranding 2.

154
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,560
Including one of the soundtracks called, and now the bonus tracks.

155
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,080
Featuring Hideo Kojima where Kojima says...

156
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,620
Wait, sorry.

157
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,200
I can't read the...

158
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
It's too fast.

159
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,660
I can't get out of the game.

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,700
But thank you!

161
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,340
Oh.

162
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,520
Do I look like I got past the fifth level of this?

163
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,600
You failed it.

164
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Oh.

165
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,100
The other requirements are Windows.

166
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,140
Intel 486...

167
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,060
5?

168
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,780
No.

169
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,380
486SX25MHZ or better CPU.

170
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,760
Hard drive with 12 megabytes free.

171
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,500
One 3.5 inch high density drive.

172
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,610
Or...

173
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,900
MS-DOS.

174
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,320
What does Macintosh need?

175
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,140
Macintosh computer.

176
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,600
Hard drive with 12 megabytes free.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,120
Oh, you do need a card.

178
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,840
You need a card.

179
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,060
640x400256 color.

180
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,980
System 6.0.7 or better.

181
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,180
Yeah.

182
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,860
Sound card support.

183
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,060
Any 100% supported Windows sound card.

184
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,160
Interface.

185
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,500
Keyboard, mouse, and joystick.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,240
Uh-oh.

187
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,480
Wait, I don't have a joystick.

188
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,520
How ambitious I know.

189
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,380
256.

190
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,080
Okay, wait.

191
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,020
Hold on.

192
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm trying to find the...

193
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,260
Okay, so...

194
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,420
This...

195
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,620
These are our li...

196
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,120
Oh, sorry.

197
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,520
You can't see.

198
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:41,900
Sorry.

199
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,480
This is...

200
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,500
These are our lives.

201
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,060
This is my score, which is definitely zero.

202
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,680
Where am I?

203
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
Oh, I'm on the ladder.

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:48,800
Okay.

205
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
And then...

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,460
This...

207
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,060
I don't know what that is.

208
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,160
Oh!

209
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,680
Level being played.

210
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,140
Okay.

211
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,580
And then I have tools eventually.

212
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,120
I will have them in here.

213
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,480
Oh!

214
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:03,860
Oh!

215
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,300
Oh!

216
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,860
Okay, it's a numpad!

217
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,580
It's numpad!

218
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,240
It's numpad!

219
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,960
Climb down.

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,400
Wait.

221
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:12,980
Okay, hold on.

222
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh my god!

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,260
Oh my god!

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,920
It's numpad.

225
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,540
It's numpad.

226
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,140
It's numpad.

227
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,440
Run right.

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh my gosh.

229
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,720
Everything is the numpad.

230
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,780
Blast a hole.

231
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,080
Blast a hole.

232
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,540
Blast...

233
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,160
Blast a hole right.

234
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,460
I don't think I have it.

235
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,540
Drops a bomb.

236
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,700
I don't have it.

237
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,940
Pick up a tool.

238
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,020
Are there any tools?

239
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,360
This game is offering nothing to me.

240
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,660
Wait.

241
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,200
I can climb down here.

242
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,800
Watch this.

243
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,060
Okay.

244
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,600
Oh my gosh.

245
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm a little monkey.

246
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:43,800
Okay.

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,300
Oh my gosh.

248
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,280
Can you imagine if I didn't have a keyboard with a numpad on it?

249
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,300
I would be so screwed.

250
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,980
It's amazing how you can control the game with your humongous brain powers.

251
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
Or maybe someone else is playing.

252
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,480
What are you talking about?

253
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,400
Someone else is playing.

254
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,480
What are you talking about?

255
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,580
Wait.

256
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,840
Why are there two cursors?

257
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,980
That's mysterious.

258
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
Happy birthday, Michael!

259
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,840
Yeah.

260
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
You might be able to play this.

261
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,260
Okay.

262
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,680
Hold on.

263
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,040
Blast a hole right.

264
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,740
Climb down.

265
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,360
Climb up.

266
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,180
Use tool.

267
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,020
Maybe I need to use my tool.

268
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,740
I have none.

269
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,000
I have no tool.

270
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,220
Do you guys see a tool?

271
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm supposed to be blasting right now.

272
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,760
I don't.

273
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,240
Use tool.

274
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,820
Oh shoot.

275
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,940
Guys.

276
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:55,970
Wait.

277
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:56,890
You can't see anything.

278
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,090
Oh.

279
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:58,970
It fixed itself.

280
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,970
Oh my gosh.

281
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,750
Oh.

282
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,450
Oh.

283
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,170
Oh my gosh.

284
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:03,990
It fixed itself.

285
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,190
We're fine.

286
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,830
We're fine.

287
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:07,930
We're fine.

288
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,990
We got a good promotion today.

289
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:09,890
Think back.

290
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:10,310
Congrats.

291
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,230
Oh my gosh.

292
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,510
Wait.

293
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,830
Oh.

294
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,430
I'm trapped now.

295
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,290
Oh gosh.

296
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,850
I got the...

297
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,530
I got it wrong.

298
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,050
Wait.

299
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,680
You can die.

300
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,100
Everybody.

301
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,860
You can die.

302
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:27,940
You can die.

303
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,120
Uh oh.

304
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,520
Okay.

305
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:28,740
Okay.

306
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,180
Yes.

307
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,730
Yes.

308
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,690
Yes.

309
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,530
Let me go up here.

310
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,570
I'm guessing we can't...

311
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,710
Blast a hole.

312
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,950
I'm guessing we can't blast a hole...

313
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,930
On the...

314
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,870
The...

315
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,350
What's it called?

316
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,030
The...

317
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,730
The...

318
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,670
Tile area.

319
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,990
Pew.

320
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,150
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

321
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,450
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey.

322
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,130
Okay.

323
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,730
The stone.

324
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,390
Yes.

325
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,870
I'm a little...

326
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,190
Guys.

327
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,950
I realized I had so much coffee today.

328
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,030
I apologize.

329
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,950
Yeah.

330
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,690
Level two.

331
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,750
All it took was figuring out...

332
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,710
That I needed to use numpad.

333
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,950
Wow.

334
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,310
That's all.

335
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,790
I accidentally had so much coffee.

336
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,050
Sorry.

337
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,150
I'm so sorry.

338
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,850
Because your hands are on the screen.

339
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,770
You must be using some sort of telekinetic powers.

340
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,250
I have one hand on the screen.

341
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,490
Now two.

342
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,730
Oh my god.

343
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,650
Oh my god.

344
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,210
It's the enemy.

345
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,810
It's the enemy.

346
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,290
He's finally here.

347
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,470
Oh, this is sick.

348
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,170
Oh my god.

349
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,670
He's fast.

350
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

351
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,450
Whoa, buddy.

352
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,730
We can talk about this.

353
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

354
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,690
He's coming!

355
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,690
Nah, he's going.

356
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:20,990
Wow!

357
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,670
He doesn't even know where I am.

358
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,370
He's fine.

359
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,010
Take that.

360
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,690
Okay.

361
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,650
He's really stupid, actually.

362
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,450
Okay, the AI is really dumb.

363
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,130
The AI is so dumb.

364
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,210
Oh my god, oh my god!

365
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,220
No, no, this is messed up.

366
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,240
He's spawn camping!

367
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,100
Right now!

368
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,320
Oh my god, I'm in trouble.

369
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,140
Sayonara, suckers.

370
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,740
He's dumb.

371
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,400
I like how it took a long, long time to load.

372
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,740
Uh... Oh... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

373
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

374
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,760
Watch this.

375
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,340
Why is it... Why is it... Why is it... You guys, it's kind of... Wait, what just happened?

376
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,260
It's... It's, um... Taking a little bit of... It's...

377
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,660
I'm getting robbed!

378
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,300
Why is it lagging so bad all of a sudden?

379
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,940
How do they know how to climb?

380
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,580
But not me!

381
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,040
I don't know how to climb!

382
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,180
You can walk on their heads, I can?

383
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,580
Oh, he just dropped some gold.

384
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,760
Idiot.

385
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,160
Okay.

386
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,600
Oh, shoot, I just noticed... Do I have to collect the skulls, too?

387
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,960
I just noticed the one down there.

388
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,160
You can walk on the red guy.

389
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,100
Wish that was me.

390
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,100
It could be you!

391
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
Oh my gosh, next con.

392
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
New convention idea.

393
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,400
The meet and walk.

394
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,840
I...

395
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,060
Meet you, walk on you.

396
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,220
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

397
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay, actually, this is doable.

398
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,720
Maybe.

399
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,300
They're kind of scaring me.

400
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,380
They're a little close, but...

401
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,240
They're a little...

402
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,960
They're a little close, but...

403
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Why is the music stop?

404
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,060
It's stressing me out.

405
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,460
Guys, I feel like I could play this for a really long time.

406
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,420
You know?

407
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,960
Except it's really laggy right now, because we have many men.

408
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,220
Many, many men!

409
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,360
Three men is too many on the screen.

410
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,300
Oh, well, I guess technically four, because there's me, too.

411
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,520
You're down?

412
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay.

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,720
Whoa!

414
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,640
Whoa!

415
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,020
Run, run, run!

416
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,160
Run, run, run!

417
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,780
I'm the load runner!

418
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,580
Whisp...

419
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,480
Whisp what?

420
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,320
Okay, where's the door?

421
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,240
Down here.

422
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,380
Oh, up here.

423
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,020
Perfect.

424
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,420
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

425
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,040
I did this actually exactly how you're supposed to, it seems.

426
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

427
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,380
Oh, they're stuck.

428
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

429
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,860
Wait, what are you guys doing?

430
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,680
Oh, no.

431
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,440
Be-doop.

432
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,840
Perfect sequence.

433
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,560
Mm-hmm.

434
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
Oh, there I am up there.

435
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,040
Is he going to monkey?

436
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,020
Oh, dang.

437
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

438
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,840
Uh, let's see.

439
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:05,800
Hat dag.

440
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,400
Hat dag.

441
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,140
There's just two pieces.

442
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,080
I don't think it's worth it.

443
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,940
I think we should go home.

444
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:10,880
Hi, Mickey.

445
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,440
How are you today?

446
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,700
I'm great.

447
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,360
I'm great.

448
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,660
Does the meet and walk come with or without shoes?

449
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,520
Probably like a bowling alley kind of situation where you rent them.

450
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,300
Meet and walk would be best if what?

451
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,180
If your screen and camera are mounted on the scaled-down Metal Gear Rex.

452
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,320
Oh, yeah.

453
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,340
Hi, Mito.

454
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:38,860
Hi.

455
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,060
Okay.

456
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,240
This guy, he's...

457
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,340
He's...

458
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,120
He doesn't know what he's doing.

459
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,820
Shut up.

460
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,640
There's hidden...

461
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,480
Hidden money.

462
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,210
I'm gonna shoot him.

463
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,230
I become so much faster when I'm a monkey.

464
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,110
No!

465
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,420
Oh.

466
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,930
Hey, buddy.

467
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,970
Let's talk about this.

468
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,010
Okay.

469
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,210
I'm glad he doesn't grab my toes.

470
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:31,270
Okay.

471
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,950
Easy does it.

472
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,050
Easy does it.

473
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,910
Da-da-da-da-da!

474
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,330
And where's the door?

475
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,050
Right there.

476
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,130
Easy peasy.

477
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,730
I can't get got by one guy.

478
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,050
As much as it happens to me on stream.

479
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,470
Let's go load right now!

480
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
The game does not like this level.

481
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,120
The game is really struggling right now.

482
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,360
Wait.

483
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,080
I don't think I did the correct sequence, everybody.

484
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,200
Uh-oh.

485
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:19,940
Wait.

486
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,680
I think I did too many.

487
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,840
Oh, he's climbing on the...

488
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,260
Wait.

489
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,820
I might be a genius.

490
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,800
Oh, I might be a genius.

491
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,960
Holy moly.

492
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,360
Oh my gosh, please.

493
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,680
You guys, I have to collect the jewels or we won't be able to...

494
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,000
Wait.

495
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,460
Ow.

496
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,700
Maybe I'm not a genius.

497
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,720
Oh wow.

498
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,240
How do I drop down?

499
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,280
Oh my god, scary.

500
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,780
Oh wow.

501
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,960
How do I...

502
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,280
Oh, I think I have to drop.

503
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:48,740
Okay.

504
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,060
Maybe I drop...

505
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,940
And drop.

506
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,720
Ah!

507
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh my gosh.

508
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,920
It's chugging along.

509
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,060
It's really chugging.

510
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,680
You got this game!

511
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,280
You can do it!

512
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,390
Um, excuse me!

513
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,090
Um...

514
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,450
I know!

515
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,770
I gotta do it.

516
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,230
I gotta drop.

517
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,370
Ah!

518
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,870
I gotta do it!

519
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,090
He respawned!

520
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,730
They can do that!

521
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,170
That's really evil.

522
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,950
Wait, so I can't just kill him?

523
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,570
Do they have magical powers?

524
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:39,730
Okay.

525
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,630
Alright, we're almost there.

526
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:42,810
Go.

527
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,610
I have a feeling it's gonna...

528
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,570
Spawn...

529
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,270
In the...

530
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,090
In the...

531
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,810
Top left.

532
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,830
That little area.

533
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,470
You see it?

534
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,590
Okay.

535
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,730
Okay, I see it.

536
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,150
I knew it.

537
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,470
I knew it.

538
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,050
Oh my god, it's a race against the clock!

539
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,310
Go, my man!

540
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:04,750
Go!

541
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,430
The lag is really just adding to the intensity of this now, isn't it?

542
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,150
Okay.

543
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,010
Wow!

544
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,210
Don't sp...

545
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,430
Did he just take that money?

546
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,030
Wait, they can take the money?

547
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,250
Don't do that.

548
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:27,850
Don't do that.

549
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,630
Oh my god.

550
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:29,890
Alright.

551
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,490
Go, die, die, die, die, die, die.

552
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,490
I took your money.

553
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,420
Grew up playing, load.

554
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,840
Okay.

555
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,540
He died.

556
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,020
Nice.

557
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,920
You grew up playing this game?

558
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,660
Is that what you said?

559
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,220
Sorry.

560
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
This is intense.

561
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,840
I have to have my full focus on...

562
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,280
Uh-oh.

563
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,160
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

564
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,800
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

565
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,670
Not for me.

566
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,410
For you, dad.

567
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,810
Played this one so much as a kid.

568
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,470
I remember.

569
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:13,970
I...

570
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,230
I remember my papa playing this so much.

571
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,510
I don't think I ever played it.

572
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,450
Now that I...

573
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,170
Now that I am actually playing it.

574
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,610
I am dead though, I know.

575
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Tactical retreat.

576
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,540
Kind of.

577
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,540
Don't take that money.

578
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Don't you dare.

579
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,320
Okay, this is actually good.

580
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,160
Because they're kind of just sticking to the ladders.

581
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,220
They're actually a little dumb.

582
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,420
Wait, this is good.

583
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
He took my money.

584
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,660
Okay.

585
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,520
I don't like how it like suddenly becomes...

586
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,820
A little spooky.

587
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,620
You know?

588
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,840
Um, excuse me, sir.

589
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,500
Excuse me.

590
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,300
Thank you.

591
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,200
Oh no.

592
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,060
Oh no, no.

593
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,560
Oh no, no, no, no.

594
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,360
Uh oh.

595
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,920
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

596
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,380
Oh no, no, no.

597
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,400
Oh no, no.

598
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
Okay, run, run, run.

599
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,120
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

600
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,360
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

601
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,360
That was kind of scary.

602
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,200
I wasn't paying attention.

603
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,220
I was looking at you guys.

604
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,200
Smooth AF?

605
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:36,940
Mm-hmm.

606
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,520
This game becomes way too scary when it involves men.

607
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,940
The, the, the, I don't like these guys.

608
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,220
Can I have a please a little bit of peace while I grave rob?

609
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,300
Please.

610
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,740
Please.

611
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,760
I just want a little bit of peace while I grave rob.

612
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,420
I'm making, I'm snaking my way up here.

613
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,700
Wait, can he get to me?

614
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,680
Oh, he definitely can.

615
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,860
Oh, he definitely...

616
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,520
Okay.

617
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,580
He can't, though.

618
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,620
Don't do it.

619
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,680
Don't do it.

620
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,340
Oh, shoot.

621
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,940
But he's like spawn camping.

622
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,440
It's like watching someone enjoy a...

623
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,300
A black and white film.

624
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,660
Okay, this is good.

625
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,200
No, it's not.

626
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,320
Wait, that guy is climbing.

627
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,140
No!

628
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,160
No!

629
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,180
Oh my gosh, this sucks.

630
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,700
This sucks!

631
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,620
Oh.

632
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,240
Oh, wait, there's no ground here.

633
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,860
Oh my gosh, I can't trap them.

634
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,560
No!

635
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,760
Please!

636
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,040
Okay, I'm gonna have to assert lupinim.

637
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,660
I'm lupinim.

638
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,140
I'm lupinim.

639
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay.

640
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,060
Run!

641
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,560
Go!

642
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,860
160 IQ monks.

643
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,820
Lupin the third!

644
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,920
Lupin the third!

645
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,580
Maybe I can...

646
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:15,820
Maybe I can...

647
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,200
Oh, shoot.

648
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:16,700
I don't know.

649
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,900
Wait, I'm gonna die!

650
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,460
I think...

651
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:22,860
Uh-oh.

652
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,600
Actually, I think I'm trapped.

653
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,680
Wait.

654
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,800
Oh, shoot.

655
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,980
Uh-oh.

656
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,520
I think I messed up.

657
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
Wait, I can't blast my way out of here.

658
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,200
Oh, gotta blast!

659
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,620
It wouldn't let me blast if you were stuck in the hole.

660
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,880
Dang.

661
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,160
Dang.

662
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,460
I have to blast down, but it wouldn't let me.

663
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,300
Hold on.

664
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,800
Let me check the controls again.

665
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,430
It just says blast a hole right, blast a hole left.

666
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,730
And then there's use tool, but I don't have any tools.

667
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:03,850
Yet.

668
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,830
I think it's the key and stuff that I'll get.

669
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,370
I think you can dig while hanging.

670
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,210
Okay.

671
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,610
You need room to blast.

672
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,530
This one's kind of tricky.

673
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,830
Yeah, because how am I supposed to get that one?

674
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,690
Because it's like...

675
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,150
It's the incline...

676
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,250
This here, right?

677
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:26,710
Huh?

678
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,900
Yeah, there's no jumping.

679
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,330
Mysterious.

680
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,330
Mysterious.

681
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,770
Can you blast while standing above it?

682
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,170
Let's practice.

683
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,150
Oh, wait.

684
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,330
I only have eight lives.

685
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,630
I only have a couple lives.

686
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,430
Oh, my God.

687
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,270
Ah!

688
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,410
Oh, my God!

689
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,750
Okay, I can't blast.

690
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,690
Can't blast.

691
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,350
Oh.

692
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,570
Wait, but I'm trapped now.

693
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:58,490
Wait.

694
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,250
Uh, no.

695
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,190
Yeah, I can't blast.

696
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,730
And they also can't get me.

697
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,420
Uh, but I'm trapped.

698
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,420
Yeah, I'm trapped.

699
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,660
Uh, 100%.

700
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,480
But how am I supposed to get this?

701
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,140
Maybe I don't even need to get the gold.

702
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,480
Maybe I just get the key and go.

703
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,360
Blast right.

704
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,020
Blast right.

705
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,640
I am...

706
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,020
I am pressing it.

707
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,720
It doesn't let me.

708
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,360
I'm trying to blast to the left.

709
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,500
Nothing.

710
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,080
Maybe...

711
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,680
Oh, shoot.

712
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,340
I just killed myself.

713
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,640
Meow.

714
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,540
Why is it...

715
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,800
So aggressive.

716
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,020
Oh, I think I get it.

717
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,800
Okay, okay, okay.

718
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,020
Wait, okay.

719
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,400
Hold on.

720
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,800
Yeah, you guys leave.

721
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,540
Leave me alone.

722
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,580
Okay, hold on.

723
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,740
So, here.

724
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,060
Oh.

725
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,120
What the?

726
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:09,980
No!

727
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,980
When I dropped, I dropped down, down.

728
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,800
That's weird.

729
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,800
Okay, hold on.

730
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,640
Blast!

731
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,680
Ah-ha!

732
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,160
Blast!

733
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,160
Ah-ha!

734
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:35,440
Ah-ha!

735
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,960
Is it gonna eat me?

736
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,310
Oh, but they respawn.

737
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,470
And for me...

738
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,270
For me...

739
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,930
For me...

740
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,910
I have to...

741
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,670
I just die.

742
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,370
This is so unfair.

743
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,770
So unfair.

744
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,810
Okay, I think I get it.

745
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,730
We'll get this one first, then.

746
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,290
Since it's a little tricky.

747
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,090
It's a little tricky of a scenario.

748
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,710
Blast!

749
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,650
Oh, blast!

750
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,150
Blast!

751
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,170
Oh, blast!

752
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,890
Oh, oh, gosh.

753
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,830
I did not see that.

754
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,790
This is running in DOS box.

755
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,370
It is!

756
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:39,050
We can press CTRL-F11, CTRL-F12 to reduce or increase the emulated CPU speed.

757
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,230
CTRL-F11?

758
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,860
Or would it be F12?

759
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,720
Blast!

760
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,140
Blast!

761
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,640
Blast!

762
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,080
Ah!

763
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,580
Ah!

764
00:32:59,720 --> 00:32:59,980
Ah!

765
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,720
It is going up!

766
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,220
It's going up!

767
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,760
It's going up!

768
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,700
Thank you!

769
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,380
I saw it going up.

770
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,140
I saw it going up.

771
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,660
Look at him go!

772
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,660
This, everything is so smooth now.

773
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,100
Oh, my gosh.

774
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,900
It's so smooth.

775
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,200
Maybe it's...

776
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,260
Okay, so we just gotta have one guy on the...

777
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,460
Thing.

778
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,160
Yeah, thank you so much.

779
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:24,960
Apparently...

780
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,420
I can't read.

781
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm sorry.

782
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,140
I'm getting chased by...

783
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,640
By these guys.

784
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,740
Fantasy Star 4.

785
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,640
4.

786
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,560
Okay, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

787
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,740
Run to the other side.

788
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,280
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

789
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,100
Run to the other side!

790
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,840
I have a friend that's really into Fantasy Star Online.

791
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,040
But I've never played any of the Fantasy Star games.

792
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,720
PSO.

793
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,550
Now they don't know what to do.

794
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,370
Oh, shoot.

795
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,130
Oh, shoot.

796
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,170
Wait, yes, yes, yes, yes.

797
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:07,550
This is good.

798
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:07,930
This is good.

799
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,610
Because now we just need one guy.

800
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,170
Blast!

801
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,030
And...

802
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,670
Blast!

803
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,990
And he's confused!

804
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:14,690
Blast!

805
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,890
And they're confused!

806
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,470
Blast!

807
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,070
And I'm not confused!

808
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,490
Ah!

809
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,490
Okay, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

810
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,350
We need to somehow get the key!

811
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,910
We need to have them follow me up here, you know?

812
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,470
Follow, follow, follow!

813
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,390
Yeah, come out, come out.

814
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:31,730
Okay.

815
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,010
No, don't turn around!

816
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,170
Oh.

817
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,550
Don't turn around, please!

818
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,230
Oh my gosh.

819
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,930
How am I supposed to get this dangie?

820
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,310
Oh.

821
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:50,830
Ah!

822
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:51,910
Last!

823
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,450
It's not a walk-over-it situation, everybody.

824
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,290
It's not a you-walk-on-top-of-it-and-you-grab-it situation.

825
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,790
Oh, man!

826
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,190
It's a grab-item-button situation.

827
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,510
Yes, indeed, it is.

828
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,570
Yes, indeed.

829
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,590
That is the situation here.

830
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:25,650
I'm bringing you up the latest news of this game.

831
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,010
In 2025, game is from...

832
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:31,550
1994?

833
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,090
Probably, I think.

834
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,970
Hot off the press.

835
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,830
This game.

836
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,210
Beep.

837
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:50,730
Oh, wait.

838
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,730
I need them to follow me.

839
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,190
What am I doing?

840
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:52,970
No, no, no.

841
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,830
Come here, come here, come here.

842
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,030
Come here, guys.

843
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,430
Yeah, yeah.

844
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,390
Yeah, you want to come down here so bad.

845
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,990
You want to follow me up.

846
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,830
No, you do!

847
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,210
You want to follow me up this ladder.

848
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,290
You're my little groupies, please!

849
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,790
Please, please, come after me.

850
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,090
Please, come after me.

851
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:08,610
Okay, yeah.

852
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,230
They're playing hard to get, everybody.

853
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:14,690
Okay.

854
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,190
We're running.

855
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,200
We're...

856
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,560
You need to taunt them?

857
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,480
I need to tease them a little bit, maybe?

858
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,440
Oh, I forgot that one right there.

859
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,600
Oh my gosh, wait.

860
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,600
Oh my gosh.

861
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,800
I completely forgot about this one.

862
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,480
Oh.

863
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,060
Oh.

864
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,740
Oh.

865
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,360
Oh.

866
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,080
Okay, the game is freaking out a little bit.

867
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,380
That's okay.

868
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,280
Actually, this is the most ideal situation.

869
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,300
Grab!

870
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,940
And I think I need to press this to use.

871
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,720
Use!

872
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,300
Use.

873
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,660
Use.

874
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,080
Use.

875
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,640
Use.

876
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,260
Use!

877
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,900
Use.

878
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,580
Use, please.

879
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,360
Use the key.

880
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,040
Use the key.

881
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:53,680
Use the key.

882
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,380
Oh, gosh.

883
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,340
Uh, guys?

884
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:55,980
Guys?

885
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,420
Uh, why isn't it using the key?

886
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,020
Oh!

887
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,400
I was pressing the wrong button.

888
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,500
That was so close.

889
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Three is to drop bombs.

890
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,360
I don't have those.

891
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,820
For fuck's sake!

892
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,180
Thank you so much for 15 months.

893
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,800
Thank you!

894
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,220
Minto teasing too much.

895
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,220
Wow.

896
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,880
Uh, how, uh...

897
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,080
Uh, maybe...

898
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't...

899
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,400
I don't know.

900
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,960
What gets these guys going?

901
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:41,900
Okay.

902
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,160
I don't know how I'm supposed to get up there.

903
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,020
We'll figure it out.

904
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,960
I believe in us.

905
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,580
Weep!

906
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,080
Sometimes the music is really kind of spooky.

907
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,640
Okay, we're gonna step on this man's head.

908
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,480
Oh, my gosh.

909
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,720
Wait, that guy just came down here.

910
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
You can't do that.

911
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,780
Try it.

912
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
I was only...

913
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,620
I was really relieved that we only had one guy to worry about.

914
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,740
Oh, wait.

915
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,940
Maybe we needed him to steal the jemmies.

916
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,380
You think?

917
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,880
Logan!

918
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,180
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

919
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,420
Wait, he just dropped one.

920
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,140
Why'd you do that?

921
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,340
Pew!

922
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,580
He was baiting me?

923
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,440
Wait, he can't get up here.

924
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,240
Oh, I believe we are at an impasse.

925
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,810
How am I supposed to get up there?

926
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,250
The year is 1994.

927
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,650
Friends premieres in the US.

928
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,130
The Lion King hits the movie theaters worldwide.

929
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,890
Becoming a sensation overnight and Lode Runner The Legend Returns is being played by a ghost maid online.

930
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,130
Digital ghost maid.

931
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,530
Yaoi!

932
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,970
Defeat them and see where they respawn.

933
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,070
Oh, so true!

934
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:33,990
Hello!

935
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:34,690
Hello!

936
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,690
Hello, come here!

937
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,170
Come here, my handsome...

938
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,750
cloaked, mysterious man!

939
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,890
Come, come, come, come.

940
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,210
Come, come, come.

941
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,150
Wouldn't...

942
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:54,470
How hasn't it always been your life's goal to be in a hole of my making?

943
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,310
Okay, now if I stay up here, they might grab it, no?

944
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,010
Alright, grab those two gems with your hands.

945
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,780
Nice!

946
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,540
Greedy, greedy, greedy.

947
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,780
Oh, he didn't grab it.

948
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,680
Oh, he dropped it and then said, nah, I'm going.

949
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,340
Come here, come here.

950
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,780
Oh wait, I need to make the holes.

951
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,640
Drop!

952
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,120
And drop!

953
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,880
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

954
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my god.

955
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:38,740
Ah!

956
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,700
Sorry, that scared me.

957
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,480
Okay, we'll have...

958
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,800
We'll stand on top of this guy and see where he spawns.

959
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,900
And see if he...

960
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,540
Oh, there we go.

961
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,860
Someone will grab it.

962
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,860
Someone will grab it.

963
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,420
They're so fast to...

964
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,360
To...

965
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,760
To respawn, you know?

966
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,840
Okay, hold on.

967
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,380
Or to climb out is what I mean.

968
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,820
Ah, he grabbed it!

969
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,460
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

970
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,120
Alright, now drop it.

971
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,710
That's a horrible way to die.

972
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,930
I always think about...

973
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,370
Whenever I think about being buried alive...

974
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,150
Have you guys ever played Corpse Party?

975
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,570
The...

976
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,710
The...

977
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,950
PSP remake.

978
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,010
Um, not the original, original.

979
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,870
But, um, the voice acting in that...

980
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,770
There's one ending where one of the characters gets buried alive.

981
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,210
And it's so...

982
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,150
Like...

983
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,330
Man was working for his paycheck.

984
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,490
For real, though.

985
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,070
Like, it's crazy.

986
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,590
He sounds so crazy.

987
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,030
Freaked me out.

988
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,690
Yeah, me too!

989
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,350
I think I'm faster than them, for sure, so...

990
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,410
And they're also a little stupid.

991
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,010
But yeah...

992
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,730
If you want a pretty freaky...

993
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,290
Performance of someone getting buried alive, I suggest that.

994
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,910
Okay, two men in the honey pit.

995
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:22,890
Wow.

996
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,070
Oh, I moved!

997
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,230
Oh, no!

998
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,750
Oh, wait.

999
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,030
Can I blast from here?

1000
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,110
I can!

1001
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,810
Oh, shoot.

1002
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,150
Okay.

1003
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:35,770
Well, that...

1004
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,010
Oh!

1005
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,330
Oh!

1006
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:36,770
Oh!

1007
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,250
Oh my god!

1008
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,030
What the hell?!

1009
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,870
Wait!

1010
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,230
Why did I fall so far?

1011
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,530
How have I fallen so...

1012
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,870
How could I have fallen so far?

1013
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,490
How could...

1014
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,830
How could this happen to me?

1015
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,410
I hate fake floors.

1016
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,470
Yeah, I tricked!

1017
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,510
I got bamboozled!

1018
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,270
I got...

1019
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,310
Absolutely demolished there.

1020
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,390
How the mighty have fallen.

1021
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,870
Oh!

1022
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,010
Wait, though!

1023
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,870
I didn't even grab onto the bar, did I?

1024
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,630
I don't think so.

1025
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:26,830
Because if I grab onto the bar, shouldn't I be able to walk over him?

1026
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,310
Unless I can't...

1027
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,150
Hold on.

1028
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,710
Let's see if he can grab onto the bar.

1029
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:32,890
I don't...

1030
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,910
Oh, but he can reach pretty high up.

1031
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,970
Could he grab my toes?

1032
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,710
I can't tell.

1033
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,390
Let's try that again.

1034
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,710
Oh, I was using the num...

1035
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,370
Not numpad.

1036
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:57,830
Oh!

1037
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,490
Grab.

1038
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:00,630
Oh

1039
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,420
my gosh!

1040
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,920
He's so fast!

1041
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,260
He's so slick!

1042
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,000
Why is he so...

1043
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,520
Bait him!

1044
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,620
Okay, I'm gonna show him my ankles.

1045
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,060
I gotta go fast.

1046
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,120
Okay.

1047
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,160
Let's continue onwards.

1048
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,620
See what else we got around going on around here, you know?

1049
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,600
Bing!

1050
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,420
Let's grab the obvious ones that we can grab.

1051
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,660
Oh, that guy's waiting for me now.

1052
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,300
This game is making me think of Hearts of Darkness on PlayStation for some reason.

1053
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,380
Did you ever play that one?

1054
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,460
I don't think so.

1055
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,680
This song is so unserious.

1056
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,860
I wonder what happens if you go into the honey...

1057
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,600
Planning

1058
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,350
my strategies right now.

1059
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,250
You may be wondering...

1060
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,170
What strategies?

1061
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,330
That's a great question.

1062
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,510
That's a really good question.

1063
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,060
Do you think he can come get me here?

1064
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,180
Okay, I think we'll have to trap him right here.

1065
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,260
Come on!

1066
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,400
No?

1067
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,700
Uh...

1068
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,980
I thought we would.

1069
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,000
Will he get stuck?

1070
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,060
I'm the stuck one!

1071
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,040
Oh, and I can't shoot.

1072
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,100
I can't blast either while I'm stuck in the honey.

1073
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,860
Okay.

1074
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,560
We live and learn.

1075
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,380
But in this case...

1076
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,420
Because one, I am dead.

1077
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,360
And also...

1078
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,340
I keep dying.

1079
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,460
I am dying and learning.

1080
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,800
I only have two lives left.

1081
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,900
What am I going to get bombs?

1082
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,340
Too sticky.

1083
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,760
Let's grab...

1084
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,340
These first.

1085
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,280
This music really is so unserious, isn't it?

1086
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,160
This music really is just like...

1087
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,360
Wait a second.

1088
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:26,520
Oh!

1089
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,200
Okay.

1090
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,000
One moment.

1091
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,460
Okay, I'm going to have to be so fast.

1092
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,580
Oh, wait.

1093
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,500
I can't blast it.

1094
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,740
I can't blast the wall.

1095
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,520
Dang it.

1096
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,500
I was going to blast it.

1097
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,520
And then send him down.

1098
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,200
And then put him in here.

1099
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,100
And then...

1100
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,880
Walk.

1101
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,480
Honey.

1102
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,500
An invincible, impenetrable barrier.

1103
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,720
Just like real life.

1104
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,640
I want some honey now.

1105
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,920
Do you guys do that?

1106
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,240
Where you eat your local honey?

1107
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,520
So you don't have allergies?

1108
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,700
Or as bad of allergies?

1109
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,360
Quiet, Fox.

1110
00:47:59,480 --> 00:47:59,840
Welcome back.

1111
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:00,640
Thank you.

1112
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,460
And Vivian.

1113
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:01,980
Welcome back.

1114
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,520
Thank you.

1115
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,780
I remember being so terrible at this.

1116
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,720
Clearly...

1117
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,120
I guess I am too.

1118
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,640
I guess...

1119
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,640
Does that work?

1120
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,280
I don't know.

1121
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,240
I like to believe it's a placebo if it doesn't work.

1122
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,440
If it doesn't work...

1123
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,880
If it does work, that's cool.

1124
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,940
But if it doesn't work, then...

1125
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,080
Maybe I can trick myself into not having allergies anymore.

1126
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,480
But supposedly that's a thing.

1127
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,140
Where...

1128
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,240
If you eat the honey of your local area...

1129
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,880
Then you are consuming...

1130
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,360
The power of the bees.

1131
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,660
And it helps you make...

1132
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,200
Be...

1133
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,980
Become stronger.

1134
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,190
And...

1135
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,750
To...

1136
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,030
Have better tolerance against...

1137
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:57,170
The...

1138
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:57,970
The...

1139
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:58,750
The pollen.

1140
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,130
I'm telling all of this to the guy from behind the other side of the wall.

1141
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:05,690
I'm like...

1142
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:06,230
I'm like...

1143
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,010
Hey, did you know?

1144
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,710
Did you know that if you...

1145
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:10,430
Eat...

1146
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:11,530
Honey...

1147
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,590
Your local area...

1148
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,730
It's like that meme of the guy in the club.

1149
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,230
He's like talking to the girl and she doesn't care.

1150
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,370
Oh...

1151
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,130
Cue...

1152
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,390
Cue the music.

1153
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,470
Cut...

1154
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,970
Fade out.

1155
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:35,710
There we go.

1156
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,730
Oh gosh, I forgot this happened again.

1157
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,210
Okay.

1158
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,590
Now I'm...

1159
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,370
Now, now I'm stuck.

1160
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,630
I think the idea is you're micro dosing on the pollen and the honey...

1161
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,390
And the honey to build tolerance.

1162
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,370
But we power...

1163
00:49:59,370 --> 00:49:59,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1164
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,430
That's the same thing.

1165
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,610
Someone get the butter.

1166
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,210
Someone help me...

1167
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,870
Oh...

1168
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,550
I don't know...

1169
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,450
Wait...

1170
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,090
Will he drop as well?

1171
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,470
I wonder...

1172
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,770
Why not just eat the bees?

1173
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,320
The honey thing is apparently false.

1174
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:32,800
No!

1175
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,980
Don't tell me that!

1176
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,780
Who told you, Snopes?

1177
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,840
He asked the Jeeves!

1178
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,720
Oh!

1179
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,600
My Google says it's true.

1180
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,920
I'm gonna ask Google AI.

1181
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,040
It's always right.

1182
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,080
Hold on.

1183
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,380
Can...

1184
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:10,880
If...

1185
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
If I eat...

1186
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,080
Honey...

1187
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,300
Oh!

1188
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,560
Can you...

1189
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,700
Oh!

1190
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,900
You can't give honey to babies.

1191
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,860
I learned that recently.

1192
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,440
Good thing I don't have a baby.

1193
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:22,600
Honey.

1194
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,180
But I said...

1195
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,560
I searched if I eat honey.

1196
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,940
And some of the things were...

1197
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,740
If I eat honey while pregnant...

1198
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,620
Can I eat honey while breastfeeding?

1199
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,260
Why?

1200
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,400
It's...

1201
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,540
Botulism.

1202
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,200
Yeah...

1203
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,200
Yeah, don't give honey to babies.

1204
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,740
Good thing I'm also not a babysitter.

1205
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,530
Wait, if I eat...

1206
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:58,250
Local...

1207
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,270
Honey...

1208
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,220
Allergies.

1209
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:03,920
I'm just gonna...

1210
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,020
Eat...

1211
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,920
Local honey allergies.

1212
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,380
That's...

1213
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:06,880
That's what I'll write.

1214
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,300
I'll send.

1215
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,060
Okay, send.

1216
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,540
Send tweet.

1217
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:18,340
The claim that eating local honey can alleviate allergies is a popular but unproven folk remedy.

1218
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,940
There is no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of local honey for allergies.

1219
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,080
No!

1220
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,120
I've been spreading lies.

1221
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,720
I've been spreading lies on the internet.

1222
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:38,520
Uh-oh.

1223
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,620
Honey can cause botulism sores.

1224
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,340
Which can be dangerous for infants under one year of age.

1225
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,900
People with bee allergies may experience allergic reactions to honey.

1226
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,940
That was...

1227
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,380
Those are the potential risks.

1228
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,380
You...

1229
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,900
Cancel me, phantom for misinformation.

1230
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,260
Botulism is a nerve toxin.

1231
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,900
It's also botox.

1232
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,640
What?

1233
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,080
No.

1234
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,140
Are you pulling my like...

1235
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,100
Buies are the friends.

1236
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,080
Yeah, they are.

1237
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,820
I'm gonna say...

1238
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,680
Placebo.

1239
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,680
No, that's true.

1240
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,540
He's not lying.

1241
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,800
What?

1242
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,420
It is botox.

1243
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,720
What is botox?

1244
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,480
What...

1245
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,480
Is botox?

1246
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,840
Wait, so people would get botulism and then afterwards they'd be like, oh my gosh.

1247
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,340
And my skin is also...

1248
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,460
My skin is also as soft as a baby's bottom.

1249
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,120
Thank you for the thank you to thank you.

1250
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,060
Today Mint learns middle school science.

1251
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,420
I don't know what you guys are learning in middle school.

1252
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,400
Botul...

1253
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,440
Botul...

1254
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,500
Bot...

1255
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,480
Botulinum toxin.

1256
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,300
Whoa.

1257
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:15,320
A potent neurotoxin protein produced by anaerobic bacterium clod...

1258
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,800
Clostridium botulinum...

1259
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,280
Bot...

1260
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,760
Botulinum...

1261
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,860
KCI...

1262
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:22,980
Wait.

1263
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,780
KCI...

1264
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:24,920
Wait.

1265
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,960
What is it?

1266
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,180
Lacti...

1267
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,860
KCI...

1268
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,480
Shiroda.

1269
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,740
Wait, la...

1270
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,180
No.

1271
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,280
Hold on.

1272
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,440
Lactobacillus KCI...

1273
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,280
Shiroda.

1274
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,000
That is...

1275
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,140
That is...

1276
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,500
Yakult.

1277
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,480
Lact...

1278
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,540
Lactobacillus KCI...

1279
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:58,860
Shiroda.

1280
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:05,720
Okay.

1281
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,300
Should I get out of this problem?

1282
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,500
The BGM goes so well with this.

1283
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,040
I love Yakult.

1284
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,120
I love Yakult.

1285
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,620
It's so good.

1286
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,300
Okay, what I'm gonna try is I'm going to get on top and I'm gonna hang.

1287
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,140
And then I'm gonna bait him over to me.

1288
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,060
And then I'm gonna fall.

1289
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,560
And then I'm gonna run under him.

1290
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,140
That's the plan.

1291
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,440
Okay,

1292
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,380
he had the same plan.

1293
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:49,860
Okay.

1294
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,980
New plan.

1295
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,100
New plan.

1296
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,560
I hear eating local ghost girls will make you...

1297
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:57,820
Wait.

1298
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,200
Make me freakier.

1299
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,120
This is true.

1300
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:10,060
Could I sell my ectoplasm like honey?

1301
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,120
Now say prestigious.

1302
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,840
What about it?

1303
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:28,030
I'll make my own music.

1304
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,990
The music stopped at like the perfect time.

1305
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:38,030
Okay, guys.

1306
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:45,190
I'm accepting new ideas for my business venture of how to get the hell out of here.

1307
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,850
Who wants to be in the shark tank?

1308
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,230
Even the game was shocked.

1309
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,030
Does the screen wrap?

1310
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:02,490
No.

1311
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:10,250
Botox is used to eliminate wrinkles by tightening up muscles through localized paralysis?

1312
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,630
That's what it is!

1313
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,330
That's freaky.

1314
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,930
Try baiting him out of there from the left.

1315
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,370
Baiting who?

1316
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:30,690
Which one?

1317
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:31,590
There's two guys.

1318
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,170
There's two guys.

1319
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,590
I heard it's used as a treatment for migraines.

1320
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:46,350
Yeah, actually I was told that I should get the Botox for my migraines.

1321
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,090
But...

1322
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,130
I'm...

1323
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,590
I don't do any of that.

1324
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,510
That stuff scares me.

1325
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,150
Ver-ver-verish multitude.

1326
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,050
It's my favorite word.

1327
00:57:59,110 --> 00:57:59,710
Did I say it right?

1328
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,450
Pre-ordering my case of gamer ghost girl ectoplasm?

1329
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,490
Yeah, brain Botox.

1330
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,030
Nice and smooth.

1331
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:09,990
Nice and smooth.

1332
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,230
You guys mean bait?

1333
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:16,590
I don't think I can...

1334
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,890
I might be able to bait this guy.

1335
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,970
The guy on the right is what you mean?

1336
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:32,920
The people I know that tried it said it worked.

1337
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:33,740
Really?

1338
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,520
Wow.

1339
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,700
Yeah, I don't know though.

1340
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,800
I actually haven't gotten many migraines recently, so...

1341
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,140
Yahoo!

1342
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,540
Yahoo!

1343
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,000
Glad YouTube recommended me one of your covers.

1344
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,780
It got me hooked.

1345
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:50,540
What?

1346
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,380
Thank you!

1347
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,520
Oh my gosh.

1348
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,460
I have a new cover coming out soon!

1349
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,180
Looking forward to having smooth brain.

1350
00:58:59,360 --> 00:58:59,880
But...

1351
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,560
I got the final mix for the song today.

1352
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,380
There was one part...

1353
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:04,880
Oh my gosh.

1354
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,160
Bless the mixer.

1355
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,320
I kept...

1356
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,160
Recording this one part.

1357
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,160
I was like, I'm sorry!

1358
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,420
I just don't like...

1359
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,640
I was being...

1360
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,280
I was being like so hyper critical.

1361
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,060
But I think now it sounds really good.

1362
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,560
The whole thing sounds really good.

1363
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,370
One jar of cute ghost made ectoplasm please.

1364
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,070
I have to figure out how to harness it.

1365
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:30,950
Okay.

1366
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:31,490
Okay.

1367
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,050
Okay.

1368
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:34,550
I did go this way before.

1369
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,230
Let's just try it.

1370
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:37,930
Beep.

1371
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:40,050
Okay, you...

1372
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,250
See, he just kind of chills here.

1373
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,330
That's what I thought would happen.

1374
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:47,630
Oh.

1375
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:48,090
Oh.

1376
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:48,490
No, never mind.

1377
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,390
I was gonna say, I forgot to get the gold from the other side.

1378
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:52,510
But I can still get it.

1379
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:53,150
Yeah, yeah.

1380
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,090
I can still get it.

1381
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:58,590
Hi, Minky.

1382
00:59:58,770 --> 00:59:58,930
Hi.

1383
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,940
I need to get this mister up here.

1384
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,920
You, mister, mister, mister.

1385
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,260
Come here.

1386
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,060
Come here.

1387
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,800
Come here.

1388
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,640
Come here.

1389
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,850
I don't know how to bait him out.

1390
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,970
Hit him with the...

1391
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,190
Hit

1392
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,260
him with the...

1393
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,140
I think I have to be really fast.

1394
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,560
Maybe I drop and then...

1395
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,820
Blast another hole.

1396
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,360
And have him drop.

1397
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,540
I think.

1398
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,720
I think I drop down here.

1399
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:53,760
Like, I drop down.

1400
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,680
Exactly where I blast this hole.

1401
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,340
And then blast the hole to the right of...

1402
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,480
Or to... Yeah, to my right.

1403
01:00:58,780 --> 01:00:59,300
I think.

1404
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,660
Come, my game is absurd!

1405
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:01,520
Thank you!

1406
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,960
Trapped one of my small Minky plushies in the cup.

1407
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,920
The other plushie is still at large in my walls.

1408
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,580
Uh oh.

1409
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,300
Probably...

1410
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,060
Like a whole infestation now.

1411
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,560
Sounds right?

1412
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,160
That makes sense?

1413
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,960
Okay, let's do it.

1414
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,260
Let's do it!

1415
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,210
I was...

1416
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,250
Why did I wait?

1417
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,130
Aw, they buried me!

1418
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,820
Game over.

1419
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,200
Oh no, that's it?

1420
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,940
Wait, is that really it?

1421
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,180
I like how he kinda looks like the Grim Reaper.

1422
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,720
Do I have to start over?

1423
01:01:59,100 --> 01:01:59,820
What's this?

1424
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,780
Oh, there's also a build your own level, you guys.

1425
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:03,400
Look at this.

1426
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,360
Look, look, look.

1427
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,960
We can make anything we want.

1428
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,340
I can make it day, I can make it night, I can make it...

1429
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:10,400
Oh!

1430
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:12,400
Spoilers?

1431
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,120
Oh!

1432
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:15,160
Whoa!

1433
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,020
One game I really want to play this week...

1434
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,860
Sorry, by the way, that I haven't put out my schedule.

1435
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,960
I've been trying to like...

1436
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,260
Figure it out.

1437
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,840
But, um...

1438
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,090
Because one thing I want to play this week is the Jurassic Park Arcade.

1439
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,920
But I'm trying to figure out how I can make it work.

1440
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,220
Since I...

1441
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,960
Without a light gun...

1442
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,680
Mori Calliope sends her regards.

1443
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,900
Yeah, we're in hell.

1444
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,940
You know?

1445
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,340
Oh!

1446
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,080
I covered it...

1447
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,840
In sand.

1448
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,080
No!

1449
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,280
Wait, this is a literal curse.

1450
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:53,880
What?

1451
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:54,880
Undo!

1452
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,180
Why doesn't it explain what anything...

1453
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,940
What any of these buttons do?

1454
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,100
Wait, I can write text.

1455
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,300
Thank you!

1456
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,620
Where'd it go?

1457
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,160
Oh!

1458
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:09,940
Oh!

1459
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:15,890
Oh!

1460
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,270
Aw, yeah!

1461
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,440
Is this undo?

1462
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,000
What's this?

1463
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:26,900
You must...

1464
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,140
Have saved a level group before you can add new levels.

1465
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:29,380
Oh.

1466
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:29,880
No.

1467
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,100
Um, okay.

1468
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,520
So this is, I guess, like, if I want to send it to somebody.

1469
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,100
What's this do?

1470
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,440
What's this do?

1471
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,060
What's this do?

1472
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:39,940
What's this do?

1473
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,060
What's this do?

1474
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:42,960
Oh!

1475
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,040
Wait, where's Minky?

1476
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,420
Wait, we can carve out Minky.

1477
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,060
Play the dirt level.

1478
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:49,680
Play it!

1479
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,300
Wait.

1480
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,400
Is this not undo?

1481
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,320
I feel like it should be, right?

1482
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:55,660
No?

1483
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,040
Okay, okay, hold on.

1484
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,180
Move this over a little bit.

1485
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,420
Minky.

1486
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,700
And a heart.

1487
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:19,710
I played that arcade game all the time as a little wisp.

1488
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:19,910
I feel like this pulp.

1489
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,930
Getting it working goes well.

1490
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:22,250
Yeah!

1491
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,190
Like, I wanna...

1492
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,110
I'm trying to figure out a way.

1493
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,390
How I can make it.

1494
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,150
But it's also...

1495
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,890
I just wanna play it at the same time.

1496
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,090
Now, how do I make the ladders?

1497
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:37,730
What's this do?

1498
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:39,710
What?

1499
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,290
Maybe that's the undo button.

1500
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,810
What's this do?

1501
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,870
Oh, I can...

1502
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:45,250
I can...

1503
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:45,570
Oh!

1504
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,670
We can be this guy.

1505
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:50,930
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1506
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:51,650
Okay, okay.

1507
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,910
And he goes.

1508
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:54,490
Okay!

1509
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:55,510
Okay, okay.

1510
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,190
Yeah, you can select every...

1511
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,710
Oh, oops.

1512
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,010
Redo.

1513
01:04:59,410 --> 01:04:59,590
Okay.

1514
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:00,530
And then...

1515
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:01,570
Oh, I have to hold down.

1516
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:03,670
Skull.

1517
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:04,230
Skull.

1518
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:04,630
Skull.

1519
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:05,110
Skull.

1520
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:05,470
Skull.

1521
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,130
So many skulls.

1522
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:10,230
Oh, I keep pressing the wrong button.

1523
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:10,750
It's so...

1524
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,870
It's like a little swirly.

1525
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,210
So, it's kinda getting me excited.

1526
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:14,510
Um...

1527
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,770
And then, what does this do?

1528
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:16,790
A paint...

1529
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:17,770
Let's just try everything.

1530
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:18,630
Let's try everything.

1531
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,050
Wait, what is this?

1532
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:24,650
What a thrill.

1533
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:26,970
Oh, no.

1534
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:28,450
Redo.

1535
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:29,930
Oh, wow.

1536
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:31,050
Wow, this gets really...

1537
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:32,910
Complicated, no?

1538
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:33,910
What's that do?

1539
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:34,850
I don't know.

1540
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:36,270
We're gonna figure it out.

1541
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,210
This...

1542
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:38,330
Oh, these are the tiles.

1543
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:39,970
This is...

1544
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,230
What does this do?

1545
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:42,950
I'm figuring it out.

1546
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,090
This is our test run.

1547
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,850
What's this do?

1548
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,510
I'll figure it out.

1549
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,890
And then a man.

1550
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:49,430
Up here.

1551
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:51,990
Bring the baddies.

1552
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,550
The minky is full of baddies.

1553
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,250
Wait, can I only have so many baddies?

1554
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:58,950
No!

1555
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:04,510
The game says you cannot be cruel.

1556
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,090
Each letter has a body.

1557
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:12,810
Minky's the body.

1558
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,630
My gamersup's income has arrived.

1559
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:15,330
Thank you!

1560
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,830
Thank you!

1561
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,570
Oh my gosh.

1562
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,050
I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys.

1563
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,150
Um...

1564
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,590
I...

1565
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:26,670
I completely forget to check, like...

1566
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,590
My...

1567
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,190
Um...

1568
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,390
My...

1569
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,970
Uh...

1570
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,610
The money that I get from the gamersup stuff.

1571
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,630
Like, all the time.

1572
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:36,850
Like, I...

1573
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,350
They are...

1574
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,090
They will...

1575
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:40,310
They'll, like, message me and be like, Hey!

1576
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,490
Like, um...

1577
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:43,270
Do you...

1578
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:43,690
Are you...

1579
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:44,630
Do you want this?

1580
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:47,450
And...

1581
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:49,470
Like, do you want us to send this to you?

1582
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:51,470
And, um...

1583
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,170
And...

1584
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:52,770
But...

1585
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:53,490
But...

1586
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:53,930
You know...

1587
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:57,090
With all the other stupid nonsense that had gone around...

1588
01:06:58,570 --> 01:06:59,090
Um...

1589
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,110
Actually...

1590
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:00,550
Uh...

1591
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,590
I completely forgot about the...

1592
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,670
The cups and everything.

1593
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:05,750
And...

1594
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:07,090
And...

1595
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:07,530
Um...

1596
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,050
Then...

1597
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,550
I got paid from that!

1598
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:10,430
And it...

1599
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,110
Oh my gosh...

1600
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:11,390
You don't...

1601
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,830
I was like...

1602
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:16,110
Cause I was gonna use the other money from my merch for, like...

1603
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,870
My 3D and things like that.

1604
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:18,650
But...

1605
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:19,590
But that...

1606
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:19,970
That...

1607
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:22,150
You guys ordering stuff from the gamersup...

1608
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,470
That...

1609
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,050
Like...

1610
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,010
It saved me...

1611
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,470
So much...

1612
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,950
So thank you guys!

1613
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,730
Thank you guys so much!

1614
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:33,490
I really...

1615
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,530
I was like...

1616
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,370
I was like...

1617
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:38,530
I was like...

1618
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:39,470
Oh man...

1619
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:40,690
This is like...

1620
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,570
Actually...

1621
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,930
A pretty big hit!

1622
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,590
I don't like talking about...

1623
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:45,790
Buddy with you guys...

1624
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:46,970
Cause I don't want you guys to like...

1625
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,230
Feel any pressure to...

1626
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,970
Do anything or anything like that...

1627
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:50,650
But...

1628
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,030
I just wanted to...

1629
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,490
I wanted to let you guys know that...

1630
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,410
You really did me a solid there!

1631
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:58,610
So thank you!

1632
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,470
Okay, let's go try these out!

1633
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,670
Oh...

1634
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:04,330
Oh yeah!

1635
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,150
What's this do?

1636
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,450
Oh, I have to pick it up...

1637
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,290
Okay, we have a thing...

1638
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,010
What's this do?

1639
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:13,570
Uh...

1640
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:14,790
Nothing...

1641
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,010
Doesn't do anything...

1642
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:17,710
Okay...

1643
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:19,910
Ow!

1644
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:20,990
That's what it does!

1645
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,790
It appears!

1646
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:22,490
It appears on one side...

1647
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:22,970
Okay...

1648
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:23,790
Use item!

1649
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,250
Will this kill me?

1650
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:29,590
Nope...

1651
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:30,310
Oh no, wait!

1652
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:31,510
I put the other things on top!

1653
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,210
I can't get them!

1654
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,810
Uh-oh!

1655
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:34,590
Beep beep boop!

1656
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:36,570
My...

1657
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:37,230
Oh, she is dying!

1658
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:37,650
No!

1659
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:39,790
It's a stink gun!

1660
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,250
Wait, what did this do?

1661
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,530
Oh, I dropped it!

1662
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:47,290
Um...

1663
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,470
I might have to redo my level...

1664
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:50,110
One moment, please!

1665
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:53,930
I have to reconsider my level!

1666
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,630
I feel pressured to donate $20 now!

1667
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,610
Not because of what you said, but because you were going with the sauce!

1668
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:02,810
Keep it up, Minto!

1669
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:04,330
The sauce!

1670
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:06,350
What kind of sauce?

1671
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:07,670
I hope I'm...

1672
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,550
Sweet and sour!

1673
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,550
That's what I always get with my chicken nuggies!

1674
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,590
Oh yeah, give me that good ol' sweet and sour sauce!

1675
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:18,990
Sweet, sour, sweet and sour!

1676
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,600
Ecto sauce!

1677
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,220
What was the one...

1678
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,220
What was the...

1679
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,560
What was the Rick and Morty sauce?

1680
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,920
Oh, she's dead!

1681
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,060
Let's gooo!

1682
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,050
Beep!

1683
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,070
What's this do now?

1684
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:39,510
Pick up...

1685
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,670
And use...

1686
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,270
Use...

1687
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,990
Oh, I cover the ground in honey!

1688
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,070
Oh, it's a one-time use!

1689
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,970
I still don't know what this thing is, but...

1690
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:52,290
Okay...

1691
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:56,230
Okay, what's this?

1692
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,170
I'm assuming this makes me dig down...

1693
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:00,210
No!

1694
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:03,470
What does this do?

1695
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,930
I don't know...

1696
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,930
I'm really glad that buying some of your stuff helped you out with the money at least...

1697
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:13,310
Thank you!

1698
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:13,650
Yeah!

1699
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,890
I tried jumping...

1700
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,930
It didn't work...

1701
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:36,490
20 pieces...

1702
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:38,730
Minto nugget with ectoplasm sauce...

1703
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,610
Large ghost...

1704
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,890
No bath water!

1705
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,010
No bath water!

1706
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:43,590
No, no, no!

1707
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:47,750
PSU's come over!

1708
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,090
Yeah!

1709
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:49,490
I dropped $10!

1710
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:50,150
No!

1711
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,690
Thank you for the...

1712
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:53,510
Thank you!

1713
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:55,010
Okay, watch this!

1714
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:56,390
Oh!

1715
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,370
They're obsessed with me, for real!

1716
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:59,670
Okay, hold on...

1717
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,330
Can I blast?

1718
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,310
No...

1719
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,210
Wait, hold on...

1720
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:03,870
Okay, I'm gonna...

1721
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,230
I'm gonna blast it...

1722
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:05,730
No, I'm not...

1723
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:06,470
I'm gonna blast...

1724
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,430
Blast...

1725
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,330
Blast...

1726
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,130
Blast...

1727
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:09,390
There...

1728
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,370
Uh...

1729
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:10,770
Wait...

1730
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:12,730
Okay...

1731
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:14,450
And...

1732
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:16,710
Release the stink!

1733
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,710
Oh, I did it up...

1734
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,490
Release the stink!

1735
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:20,250
Oh!

1736
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:22,210
Wait, we're just disconnected...

1737
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:22,830
Ah!

1738
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,430
What's happening?

1739
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:24,070
Ah!

1740
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:25,890
We're okay...

1741
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:26,730
Wait...

1742
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:27,230
Oh!

1743
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,470
I know, I just disconnected...

1744
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:31,370
I just murdered them!

1745
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:35,690
Everything's fine!

1746
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,750
Everything's okay!

1747
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,630
The stink cloud...

1748
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,330
Worked!

1749
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:44,670
It saved me!

1750
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:47,270
Sim!

1751
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:48,150
Welcome to Muppet Ship!

1752
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:48,610
Thank you!

1753
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,310
The stink cloud...

1754
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:52,350
Saved me from actual death...

1755
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:52,730
In this...

1756
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,670
In this...

1757
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,450
What a thrill...

1758
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:57,410
Okay...

1759
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,690
Let's get back to the actual game...

1760
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:00,910
Oh, sorry...

1761
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:01,950
I was pressing my...

1762
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,870
OBS...

1763
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:04,270
That's what I've been looking at...

1764
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:05,130
The OBS projector...

1765
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,680
Okay...

1766
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,000
Main menu...

1767
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah...

1768
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,580
No...

1769
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,320
What's this one?

1770
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,100
Multiplayer?

1771
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,640
Oh, what's this one?

1772
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:24,920
Oh...

1773
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,820
Okay, if I wanna load one...

1774
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,380
What's this?

1775
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:33,320
Wait...

1776
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:33,640
You!

1777
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,580
You!

1778
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:34,660
You!

1779
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,060
Oh my god...

1780
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:52,980
Wait...

1781
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:53,800
Who grabbed which key?

1782
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:54,900
Use, use, use...

1783
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,460
Use...

1784
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:56,020
Oh shoot...

1785
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:56,860
You have that key...

1786
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,300
Use...

1787
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:57,820
Oh wait...

1788
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,860
Oh gosh...

1789
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,140
Okay...

1790
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,220
Use...

1791
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:00,960
Use key...

1792
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,300
Oh...

1793
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,060
I don't know how to use...

1794
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:07,920
Oh my gosh...

1795
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:08,920
I need to get Doki in...

1796
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,340
And play this together...

1797
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,380
My friend is dead...

1798
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,640
My friend is dead...

1799
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:24,560
Wait...

1800
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,000
What's this do?

1801
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:28,660
Oh...

1802
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:29,160
Oops...

1803
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,520
Too bad it's...

1804
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,560
Too bad it's...

1805
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,440
Too bad it's local...

1806
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,260
I missed out on the cup to take...

1807
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,280
To take...

1808
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,940
This to pretend I got this...

1809
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:44,140
No!

1810
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:44,920
Wait, no!

1811
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:45,840
It's way too much!

1812
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,800
I may help you do it well...

1813
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,460
DAKU!

1814
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,520
Look at these guys...

1815
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,840
They don't know what to do without me...

1816
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,280
Do I have to start at...

1817
01:13:59,280 --> 01:13:59,720
Level one?

1818
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,840
That seems to be the case...

1819
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,200
But now we're faster...

1820
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,320
And smarter...

1821
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,880
More brilliant...

1822
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,960
You could say...

1823
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,460
You could say that I...

1824
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,640
Can you do save states?

1825
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,700
I don't know...

1826
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,460
I've never actually used DOS box before...

1827
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,500
Pirate, help!

1828
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,000
You told me earlier...

1829
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,320
How to increase the frame rate!

1830
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:33,620
Haddle for me!

1831
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,140
Too!

1832
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,800
See you, thank you, welcome back!

1833
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,540
Speaking of sauces and nuggies...

1834
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,100
What's your favorite...

1835
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:49,960
Snack...

1836
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,940
Besides the stale popcorn?

1837
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,000
My favorite snack?

1838
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:55,740
Okay...

1839
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,260
I haven't been in the stale popcorn...

1840
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,080
But...

1841
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,060
There's these...

1842
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,280
They're like snap peas...

1843
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,100
But I don't like peas...

1844
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:05,540
But they're...

1845
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:09,820
I don't remember what they're called...

1846
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,460
But they're really yummy!

1847
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,400
Jelly?

1848
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,180
Okay, wait...

1849
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,900
That actually might be my favorite snack...

1850
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,720
It's the world famous blackjack player...

1851
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,560
Mint Phantom...

1852
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,160
That's me!

1853
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,580
Double down, double down, double down...

1854
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,540
All in, all in, all in...

1855
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,520
Double down, double down, double down...

1856
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:23,680
Double down!

1857
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,630
Have you ever played Elder Scrolls?

1858
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,690
I've never played a single Elder Scrolls before...

1859
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,530
So no...

1860
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:35,570
Wait...

1861
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:36,850
Oblivion is Elder Scrolls, no?

1862
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,630
There's no save states in Vanilla DOS box...

1863
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:42,190
Shoot...

1864
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,310
Well thank you...

1865
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,730
Thanks for letting me know...

1866
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,870
Then I have played Elder Scrolls Oblivion...

1867
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:52,530
That's it...

1868
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,030
Oblivion doesn't count?

1869
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:58,870
Wait...

1870
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:59,290
No, it should!

1871
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:00,870
That's what I'm saying...

1872
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:01,930
Should count!

1873
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:04,550
Beep beep beep...

1874
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,650
Monkey, monkey, monkey...

1875
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,990
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey...

1876
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:13,230
Should play the other sometime?

1877
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:15,970
I've been really itching for like a...

1878
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,150
What do you call...

1879
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:20,970
Just like a...

1880
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:26,670
I don't...

1881
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,150
I don't know...

1882
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,690
I'm just gonna...

1883
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,270
Okay...

1884
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:32,730
I've been itching for like a David Cage game...

1885
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,070
I don't want to...

1886
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:37,710
Play a David Cage game...

1887
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:38,670
But just a game like...

1888
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,790
Of that kind of...

1889
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:40,530
You know...

1890
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:53,630
Okay...

1891
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,910
Alright, our first...

1892
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,040
Our first red guy...

1893
01:16:58,990 --> 01:16:59,410
What's...

1894
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:00,370
What level did I get to?

1895
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,050
Do you guys remember?

1896
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:05,110
Do you guys remember what level we got to before?

1897
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,190
Wait, how do I get up there again?

1898
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,500
Up, up, up, up...

1899
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,040
Up to the top!

1900
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,120
Eating ragtars!

1901
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:19,980
Yes!

1902
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,160
Thank you!

1903
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,400
Deadly premonition!

1904
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,360
Oh my gosh!

1905
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:25,760
Wait!

1906
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:27,920
That's perfect!

1907
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,880
I've been wanting to play that...

1908
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,400
Wait, hold on...

1909
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,700
Let me write that down...

1910
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,260
So I don't forget...

1911
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,760
Blade Runner and now Load Runner...

1912
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,800
I'm just running...

1913
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,960
I'm just running...

1914
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,400
Is this the games I played on my dad's PC Nostalgia stream arc?

1915
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,260
Kinda?

1916
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,100
Kinda?

1917
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,440
It's not...

1918
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,540
Not that...

1919
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:08,130
Yeah, false, stupid...

1920
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:14,210
I haven't bought it yet...

1921
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:14,670
Oh, wait...

1922
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:15,610
Oh, shoot...

1923
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:15,910
Oh...

1924
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:17,290
Oh, here we go...

1925
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:18,590
I'm an idiot...

1926
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,650
There we go...

1927
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:22,850
Ghost Runner...

1928
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,070
Someone make a mod of this game...

1929
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,170
Someone make a mod of this game...

1930
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,970
Where it's me running from...

1931
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:29,610
What would I...

1932
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:31,090
I don't run from anything...

1933
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,090
No, it would be...

1934
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,390
You guys running from...

1935
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:33,870
Me...

1936
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,710
This guy from a trip?

1937
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:39,270
Oh, yeah...

1938
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:40,670
Happy birthday!

1939
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:45,890
Oh, yeah...

1940
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:48,390
Okay...

1941
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:52,130
Okay...

1942
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:52,590
Oh...

1943
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1944
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:54,790
Keep running...

1945
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:55,530
Keep running...

1946
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,750
Keep running...

1947
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:00,450
What happens if you catch us?

1948
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:02,530
Um...

1949
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,810
Do you not...

1950
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:05,030
See...

1951
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:07,450
That guy left a skull on the ground!

1952
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,790
Oh, I didn't even know he took that!

1953
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:10,690
What a...

1954
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:11,430
Little...

1955
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,210
Sneak...

1956
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,150
Ground!

1957
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:17,910
Now I'm gonna have to go grab it!

1958
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,610
Oh...

1959
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,290
My...

1960
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:21,750
God...

1961
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,390
Haha!

1962
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:39,390
I had to run there anyway...

1963
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:39,730
That's true!

1964
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,730
I can't believe that guy...

1965
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:44,910
Stole my...

1966
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:45,750
Gold!

1967
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,270
This one was kinda silly...

1968
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,870
I don't remember...

1969
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,090
I wish I could do save states...

1970
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,570
I'm not gonna lie...

1971
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,910
Really wish I could do save states...

1972
01:19:58,910 --> 01:19:59,330
Meow!

1973
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,570
I like the way they just kinda like...

1974
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:06,990
Hold themselves up down there like...

1975
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:07,210
Wow!

1976
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:10,050
I guess I'll give up!

1977
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:10,790
That's what he says...

1978
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:17,370
Okay...

1979
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:19,550
I'm actually getting so good at this game...

1980
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:22,790
If you wanna do Deadly Premonition...

1981
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:25,050
Try...

1982
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:26,610
Mystery of the Druids...

1983
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:27,870
Oh, I think some...

1984
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,130
You guys told me about that, no?

1985
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:32,530
Pretty sure...

1986
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,230
Yeah, yeah...

1987
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:37,770
Pretty sure...

1988
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,970
If you wanna do more...

1989
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:40,450
Old DOS games in the future...

1990
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:42,150
You should look in the DOS Box X...

1991
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:43,650
It's also free...

1992
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:45,050
It has more...

1993
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,050
Game-oriented features...

1994
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:46,790
Like save states...

1995
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:47,830
Not sponsored...

1996
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:48,010
Oh!

1997
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:48,910
Thank you!

1998
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,670
I will try it next time...

1999
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,690
Save states would be so nice here, no?

2000
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,450
I have 10 lives though...

2001
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:56,830
Could be where...

2002
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:58,250
The music is just...

2003
01:20:58,910 --> 01:20:59,390
Sometimes...

2004
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:00,390
Really...

2005
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,210
Really something...

2006
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:05,010
Oh!

2007
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:05,930
Oh, shoot!

2008
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:07,170
I messed that up...

2009
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:07,810
Oh no!

2010
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:08,690
Wait...

2011
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:09,990
I might need to make another hole...

2012
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,290
Okay...

2013
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,070
You walk...

2014
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,750
Yeah...

2015
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,670
And then I run...

2016
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:14,730
Perfect...

2017
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:15,710
Oh my gosh...

2018
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,190
Couldn't have gone better...

2019
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:19,870
Honestly...

2020
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:29,850
It's kind of really... It's kind of really cursed how it just kind of...

2021
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:34,890
Oh my god.

2022
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,570
Okay, we need to get to the top.

2023
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:40,970
Bop bop bop bop to the top.

2024
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,810
MGS... V... Wait, where did that guy come from?

2025
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:55,690
Co-op?

2026
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:56,330
Wait, what?

2027
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:01,670
MGSP playthrough with friends or wisps?

2028
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:02,510
Wait, that'd be awesome.

2029
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,370
I did not see it though, Micmac.

2030
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:05,430
Okay, we drop.

2031
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,390
We dropping.

2032
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:07,750
Where are we dropping, boys?

2033
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:09,490
Down here.

2034
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,800
And fall and fall and I do be running.

2035
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,000
And the music do be stopping.

2036
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,280
Oh my god.

2037
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:22,960
That?

2038
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,820
What the hell was that?

2039
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,200
Oh, what the hell was that?

2040
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,100
Now I'm trapped.

2041
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,380
Wait, oh my gosh.

2042
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,040
No, no, no.

2043
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:32,880
Okay.

2044
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,160
That was so unfair.

2045
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,500
What was that spawn point?

2046
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,080
What the hell?

2047
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,340
What the hell?

2048
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,040
What the hell was that?

2049
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,550
This chair is not... I got a new chair.

2050
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,370
I don't know if I told you guys I got a new chair.

2051
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:10,390
And it's kinda nice.

2052
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:12,250
But...

2053
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,590
But the...

2054
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:19,290
It hurts if I'm wearing like...

2055
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:19,950
Shorts.

2056
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:22,890
It's not nice on my legs.

2057
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,070
The material, you know?

2058
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,630
So I usually have like a blanket.

2059
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:30,090
New chair fun.

2060
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:30,330
New chair fun.

2061
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:31,370
No, I love my chair.

2062
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,790
It's one of those like crisscross applesauce chairs.

2063
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:35,750
So I can just...

2064
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,470
I sit in very unusual ways.

2065
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:40,150
And it allows me to do so.

2066
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:42,350
Quite easily.

2067
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,210
Oh, I think I...

2068
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,550
Sprayed that...

2069
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:48,090
Too early.

2070
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:49,150
Maybe.

2071
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:50,090
No.

2072
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:50,570
Oh.

2073
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:56,990
They make those?

2074
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:57,370
Yeah.

2075
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:58,330
Yeah, they do.

2076
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,270
I like...

2077
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,730
I'm constantly...

2078
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,750
Sitting like...

2079
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:04,330
Crazy ways.

2080
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:05,290
So...

2081
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,850
It's actually super helpful.

2082
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:09,370
Okay.

2083
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,170
Perfect.

2084
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,390
It wasn't too early at all.

2085
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,320
Uh oh.

2086
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,560
Uh oh.

2087
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,760
Uh oh.

2088
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:35,590
Oh shoot.

2089
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:36,310
Oh shoot.

2090
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,350
Ow.

2091
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:40,230
Oh shoot.

2092
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:43,610
Yeah, there we go.

2093
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:45,010
Oh!

2094
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:45,650
Ah!

2095
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:46,950
Ah!

2096
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:50,540
Ha ha ha!

2097
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:53,680
Heee...

2098
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:54,920
Heee...

2099
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,060
Heee...

2100
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:56,960
Heee...

2101
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:58,660
Heee...

2102
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,640
Ha ha ha ha!

2103
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,340
Everything's fun!

2104
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,240
We're chill!

2105
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,720
We're chill, right guys?

2106
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,200
We're chill.

2107
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,480
Original Blair Witch Game Trilogy.

2108
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:16,900
Not the...

2109
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,800
From the 2000s.

2110
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,940
Not the 2019 one.

2111
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,440
I don't think the dog dies on the 2019 one.

2112
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,500
I think you saved the dog.

2113
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,680
It's just...

2114
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,460
The dog gets gravely injured.

2115
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,500
And so it's still...

2116
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:33,960
Bad.

2117
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,300
Do you guys ever sometimes watch videos of...

2118
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:41,480
Whoops.

2119
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,200
Why isn't it?

2120
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:42,860
Why am I not going?

2121
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,320
There we go.

2122
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,680
Videos of...

2123
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,700
People spoiling...

2124
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:48,800
Movies.

2125
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,280
Okay.

2126
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,440
So it's like...

2127
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,680
They're spoiling...

2128
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:52,060
For this...

2129
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:52,800
In this context...

2130
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,920
They spoil...

2131
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,060
Horror movies.

2132
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:57,620
And...

2133
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,920
It's mainly because like...

2134
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,980
Sometimes you never know...

2135
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,000
Horror movies are like...

2136
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,800
Such a hit or miss.

2137
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,220
Sometimes with like...

2138
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,560
What's in it.

2139
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:06,880
I don't know.

2140
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,840
For example...

2141
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,280
Like...

2142
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:08,920
If they're like...

2143
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,120
Oh, we're just gonna kill the dog.

2144
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,600
Dogs are an AI.

2145
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:13,380
No, they're not.

2146
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:16,760
But...

2147
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,580
I watched one...

2148
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:18,640
And sometimes I'll do it...

2149
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,560
If I'm like...

2150
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,760
Not sure if I'll like a movie or not.

2151
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,420
I did one...

2152
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,820
There's that new movie that came out...

2153
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:25,080
Like...

2154
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:25,780
I think it's called...

2155
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,780
Together.

2156
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,720
And it's like a...

2157
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,460
Really...

2158
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,160
It's like a...

2159
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,200
Apparently it's like a super body horror.

2160
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,120
What the hell?

2161
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,460
Leave me alone.

2162
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:38,480
So I was like...

2163
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,560
I don't really do body horror well...

2164
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,460
But I'm still...

2165
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:42,120
Cur...

2166
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,280
Cur...

2167
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:43,600
Cur...

2168
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,200
Curious...

2169
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:45,840
About it.

2170
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:48,760
Gaming.

2171
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:49,240
We're gaming.

2172
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:49,620
We're gaming.

2173
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:50,000
We're gaming.

2174
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:50,700
We're gaming.

2175
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:54,800
Holy...

2176
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,180
And so...

2177
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,580
I watched one of those today.

2178
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,320
Where...

2179
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,440
Where was I going with this?

2180
01:26:59,500 --> 01:26:59,960
I don't...

2181
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,900
I don't quite remember.

2182
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:03,460
I think...

2183
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:03,800
Oh!

2184
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,480
Uh...

2185
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,800
It was about the movie because...

2186
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:07,220
Um...

2187
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:08,120
Because...

2188
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:08,560
Because...

2189
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:08,840
Because...

2190
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,640
Because...

2191
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,160
Because...

2192
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,560
Because...

2193
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,040
Because...

2194
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,260
Because...

2195
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:11,540
Because...

2196
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:11,560
Because...

2197
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:11,600
Because...

2198
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,040
Because...

2199
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:12,240
Because...

2200
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:12,320
Because...

2201
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:12,380
Because...

2202
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,140
Because...

2203
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:13,820
Because...

2204
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:14,240
Because...

2205
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:14,260
Because...

2206
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,260
Because...

2207
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,500
Because...

2208
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,840
I love horror, but... Oops.

2209
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,020
I messed it up again.

2210
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:36,870
I messed it up again.

2211
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:37,310
Okay.

2212
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:38,590
Oh, shoot.

2213
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:39,090
Wait.

2214
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:39,810
There we go.

2215
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:42,710
The game is on my side.

2216
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,950
Better at the beginning than at the end.

2217
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:46,350
Right!

2218
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:48,450
Yeah.

2219
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:55,110
So, I guess warning for anybody who was gonna go see that... Go see that movie.

2220
01:27:57,790 --> 01:28:00,550
I love the Metal Gear stage.

2221
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:01,730
This one's great.

2222
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,240
Okay, they haven't stolen any of the things yet.

2223
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:15,120
Which is pretty nice.

2224
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,080
Don't do that.

2225
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:17,660
Okay, good.

2226
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:22,670
Wait, he stole it!

2227
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:23,110
What?

2228
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:23,930
A little bastard.

2229
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:28,910
Taking that... Getting that five-finger discount.

2230
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,770
John Wick teaches you why you don't kill dogs.

2231
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:43,230
John Wick was... It's like the only movie that I will probably watch that has that kind of content.

2232
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:44,850
I'm not gonna lie.

2233
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:50,070
I don't mess around with... With pets, you know?

2234
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,770
And stuff.

2235
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:52,890
I really don't.

2236
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:57,010
Red Bros are confused.

2237
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:57,710
WHOA!

2238
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,070
No way.

2239
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:00,330
What?

2240
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:02,110
That guy had the worst spawn ever!

2241
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:07,470
Oh my gosh.

2242
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:08,750
I was just gonna keep running.

2243
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:09,870
Good thing I looked.

2244
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,600
No, this one was hell.

2245
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:23,580
No.

2246
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,260
This one was hell.

2247
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,260
I don't wanna do it again.

2248
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,820
Who put these ladders everywhere?

2249
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:36,100
These guys are sick and twisted.

2250
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,440
This is actually Death Stranding.

2251
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,780
That's also in Death Stranding.

2252
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,160
Who put these ladders everywhere?

2253
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:53,990
John Wick is awesome.

2254
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:56,690
Yeah, but you guys, I'm like an empath.

2255
01:29:57,210 --> 01:30:00,910
So like, when an animal dies, I get sad.

2256
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:04,710
I'm an empath.

2257
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:07,390
We've only lost one life.

2258
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:08,270
That's pretty good.

2259
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:11,530
I'm proud of us, team.

2260
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:13,130
I'm proud of us, chat.

2261
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:17,450
My empath Oshi.

2262
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,430
I'm an empath.

2263
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,090
I'm an empath.

2264
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:24,850
Me,

2265
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:37,640
boys.

2266
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:38,900
Follow me.

2267
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:39,540
No, no.

2268
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:41,720
Follow me, boys.

2269
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:45,100
You know you want... Oh, shoot.

2270
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,760
Oh, I messed up.

2271
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,580
Change of plans, boys.

2272
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:56,840
Wait.

2273
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:59,300
Yeah, they'll keep going up.

2274
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:00,440
Oh.

2275
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,620
Follow me, boys.

2276
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:09,900
Follow me.

2277
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:27,720
Follow-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f

2278
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,960
Oh, they're so stupid.

2279
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,680
Oh, you guys are so simple.

2280
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:37,920
Simple little...

2281
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,400
Collect

2282
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,810
everything before I use... I guess so.

2283
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:49,330
I guess it unlocks it and then the portal...

2284
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:53,990
Oh, this one again.

2285
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:54,270
Okay.

2286
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:59,130
This is going to hurt me a lot more than it hurts you.

2287
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:02,170
Wahoo!

2288
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:02,670
Okay.

2289
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,790
Guys, I'll be honest, I don't really know...

2290
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:10,970
I don't really have a plan for how long today's stream is.

2291
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:13,330
Um...

2292
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:14,570
He just took that!

2293
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:15,910
I just saw him!

2294
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:17,210
I just saw him take that!

2295
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:18,870
And you take that one.

2296
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:19,250
Good, good.

2297
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:22,030
Good job, good job, good job.

2298
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:24,130
Beep boop!

2299
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:25,350
Oh, and he just left it.

2300
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:25,730
Okay.

2301
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:26,790
That works too.

2302
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,190
That works.

2303
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:34,870
I run and grab this...

2304
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:37,750
And then you reincarnate...

2305
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,870
And I grab these...

2306
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:41,530
Beep beep!

2307
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:45,130
Don't go up that ladder!

2308
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:46,110
That's not for you!

2309
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:51,210
Oh, he didn't grab it.

2310
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:53,230
Okay, he kind of sucks.

2311
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:01,470
I wonder if he'll follow me.

2312
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,260
That's awkward.

2313
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:07,440
Oh, wait.

2314
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:08,060
No, no, no.

2315
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,280
You're not supposed to follow me.

2316
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:10,260
Wait, no!

2317
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,620
You're not supposed to follow me!

2318
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,220
No, please!

2319
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:19,940
Okay.

2320
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:20,940
Okay.

2321
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,460
Oh, he took it!

2322
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:22,780
He took it!

2323
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,080
He took it!

2324
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:23,340
He took it!

2325
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:23,460
He took it!

2326
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,420
Yeah, I know you couldn't resist, you criminal scum.

2327
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,520
Um...

2328
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:31,440
And then I go up.

2329
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,300
Oh, shoot.

2330
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,320
Oh, wait, though.

2331
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,240
Actually, this is good.

2332
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,120
I think.

2333
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:39,540
Why wouldn't they follow you?

2334
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:40,640
I don't know.

2335
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
They're just so obsessed with me or something.

2336
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:47,320
They're obsessed with me or something.

2337
01:33:55,180 --> 01:33:56,340
Just like us?

2338
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:57,100
Really?

2339
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,670
We made it back!

2340
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:04,290
Okay, so it's level 10 is our trouble spot.

2341
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:05,500
Oh, golly.

2342
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,890
I don't know.

2343
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:09,350
He's not a criminal.

2344
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:10,890
You're the one robbing the place.

2345
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:15,950
In style.

2346
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:21,690
Huzzah!

2347
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:26,230
I'm not obsessed.

2348
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:26,590
No?

2349
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:29,550
Not yet.

2350
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,560
Okay, let's grab the easy ones first.

2351
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,480
Ew.

2352
01:34:48,500 --> 01:35:00,820
Now that I know that I can get a stink gun and I can get a bucket that throws honey on the people, I feel really... like I'm just missing out.

2353
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:04,930
I wonder where the portal will appear to...

2354
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:08,620
It kind of will make me determine which way...

2355
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,480
Like, do I go for this one first?

2356
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:12,980
Or do I go for the ones on the left first, you know?

2357
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:34,890
I left for a while and how are you still at this level?

2358
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,750
I just got back here!

2359
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:37,890
What are you talking about?

2360
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,030
We just got here!

2361
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:43,970
Defeat the one on the left to earn time...

2362
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:45,390
on the honey.

2363
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:49,610
Not sure where respawn is.

2364
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,170
But I also can't bait him out.

2365
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:51,830
That's the issue.

2366
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:55,030
I don't know how to get him out.

2367
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:56,850
When he's in there?

2368
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:58,150
When he like gets inside there?

2369
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:59,050
When I drop down?

2370
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,570
He...

2371
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,550
He acts like a total weirdo.

2372
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,080
I wish when I grabbed this one I didn't fall all the way completely to the bottom.

2373
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:11,000
It makes no sense.

2374
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:14,480
Oh wait!

2375
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,120
Oh, that's right!

2376
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,420
I was gonna blast him.

2377
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,000
I remember.

2378
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,120
I was gonna drop and...

2379
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:21,920
and do that thing.

2380
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:22,480
I remember.

2381
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:23,320
I remember.

2382
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:23,720
I remember.

2383
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,380
I messed it up because I was too slow.

2384
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,220
I remember.

2385
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:28,620
Okay.

2386
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:30,840
I was too slow.

2387
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:31,440
Okay.

2388
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,460
Wah!

2389
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,580
Oh, there he is.

2390
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:38,880
Actually, wait.

2391
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:39,460
I'm gonna kill you?

2392
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:39,840
Oh.

2393
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:40,740
Nevermind.

2394
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,120
Okay, redo redo.

2395
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:43,840
Let me...

2396
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,000
Let me let him spawn.

2397
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:45,900
Let me let him spawn.

2398
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:47,500
Okay, hold on.

2399
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,540
Oh sh...

2400
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,280
I was slow again.

2401
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:53,580
Why do I keep doing that?

2402
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:23,740
I think I'm like just being overly cautious of how fast the holes...

2403
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:24,640
You know?

2404
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,140
Okay.

2405
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:25,980
Die!

2406
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:26,380
Die!

2407
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:27,200
Die!

2408
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:27,840
Die!

2409
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:28,140
Die!

2410
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:28,740
Die!

2411
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:30,640
Die!

2412
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:32,820
Okay, nice.

2413
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,740
Oh, that's...

2414
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:36,580
Ooh...

2415
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:37,660
Ooh...

2416
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:37,900
Ooh...

2417
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,140
Ooh...

2418
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:39,840
Ooh...

2419
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,420
Ooh...

2420
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:41,640
Ooh...

2421
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,180
Me when it's a full mood.

2422
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:44,540
Ow!

2423
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:44,800
Ow!

2424
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:46,500
Let's go.

2425
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:52,950
How do I get back to the other side?

2426
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,190
Hmm...

2427
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,660
How do I get back over there?

2428
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,490
Oh, I see.

2429
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:17,440
Yes.

2430
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,200
Oh, I found it out.

2431
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,640
Alright.

2432
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,520
We're gonna get this.

2433
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,140
And then...

2434
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:33,040
Oh, you're kidding me.

2435
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,020
This

2436
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:55,510
guy!

2437
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:56,210
This guy!

2438
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:57,390
If I fall, he falls!

2439
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:59,530
I don't know how to joke him.

2440
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,750
Okay, hold on.

2441
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,920
Okay, hold on.

2442
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:51,980
I did it!

2443
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:53,180
I'm a gamer.

2444
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:01,730
I might be a gamer.

2445
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:12,420
Oh, he made it!

2446
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,300
We made it!

2447
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,520
We made it!

2448
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,320
Starting into Donnie.

2449
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,980
Why do I always get called Donnie?

2450
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,700
Oh, no.

2451
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:32,800
What?

2452
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,120
They're all over the place.

2453
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,080
This one's kind of freaky.

2454
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:37,540
Wait, this one's freaky freaky.

2455
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,360
What's the best course of action here?

2456
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:41,720
Okay.

2457
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:43,380
Probably?

2458
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,340
Well...

2459
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,140
What a gamer.

2460
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,300
Nice juking gamer.

2461
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,220
Thank you.

2462
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,820
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2463
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:57,580
Oh, uh...

2464
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,200
That's not what I meant to do.

2465
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:00,760
Run, run, run.

2466
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:01,640
Oh no!

2467
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,140
Okay, they're stupid.

2468
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:05,740
They're for real stupid.

2469
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:07,820
They're for real stupid.

2470
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:09,940
Beep!

2471
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:13,340
I have a feeling...

2472
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,560
I have a feeling the portal's going to be up there.

2473
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:20,140
That's my hunch.

2474
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,400
That's my hunch.

2475
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,140
That's gonna be up there in the right corner.

2476
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,240
Because why else would this ladder exist?

2477
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:27,840
It goes to nowhere!

2478
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:34,430
Minky, minky, minky.

2479
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:38,430
My dad played this while we watched for hours cheering every level he got more than last run.

2480
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:38,810
Yeah!

2481
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,550
Same!

2482
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:39,730
Hey!

2483
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:45,400
Who is hunch?

2484
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:46,080
No.

2485
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,940
It's my hunchback.

2486
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:49,820
My gamer posture.

2487
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,680
Because now I'm an actual gamer.

2488
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:53,800
I'm a gamer, I'm a gamer.

2489
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:55,340
I'm a gamer, I'm a gamer.

2490
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:57,760
I'm a gamer, I'm a gamer.

2491
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,820
I'm a gamer and a dreamer.

2492
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,260
I'm a gamer and a dreamer.

2493
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:01,580
I'm a gamer, I'm a gamer.

2494
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:03,880
I'm a gamer and a dream...

2495
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,160
Oh no, no.

2496
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:10,600
I'm a gamer, I'm a gamer, I'm a gamer and a dreamer.

2497
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:31,630
Just keep going in circles.

2498
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:33,130
Just keep going in circles.

2499
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:36,750
Never let them know your next move.

2500
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:38,930
Except that you're going in circles.

2501
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:40,430
That's okay.

2502
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:41,510
How'd they know that?

2503
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,170
Drop.

2504
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:44,850
Beep beep.

2505
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:48,820
Ow.

2506
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:49,660
Wait.

2507
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:50,240
Oh, shoot.

2508
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,080
I messed up.

2509
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:04,380
Bottom of the screen!

2510
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,200
Because there's no grass.

2511
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:07,640
Grass.

2512
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:12,060
There's no grass down there.

2513
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,120
Oh, I have to go here.

2514
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:14,480
Okay.

2515
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:15,500
And then blast it.

2516
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:17,580
Perfect.

2517
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:19,020
What the?

2518
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:21,260
Oh, what?

2519
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,140
That's crazy.

2520
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:25,420
First try.

2521
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,360
Oh,

2522
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:52,050
I think I see how to get out.

2523
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:52,590
Oh, okay.

2524
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:52,970
I see.

2525
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,530
Oh, I have to go up.

2526
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,260
Up, up, up.

2527
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:03,820
Wait, but how do I get to this?

2528
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,120
Oh.

2529
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,060
Ah, this one sucks.

2530
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,580
Oh, my God.

2531
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,600
Did you just drop down?

2532
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,500
You s- Oh, you sons of bitches.

2533
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,200
You're ruining my whole plan.

2534
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:15,260
Dan.

2535
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:19,840
This sucks.

2536
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:20,460
This sucks.

2537
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,320
Not even the music likes this level.

2538
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,080
Stop.

2539
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:30,420
Beep beep.

2540
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:32,640
Can I?

2541
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,080
I guess they could technically drop down, can't they?

2542
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:35,720
Oh, yes.

2543
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:35,980
They can.

2544
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:38,700
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2545
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:40,680
And they're stealing my gold.

2546
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,180
Stop it.

2547
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:46,000
Oh my god, they dropped another piece.

2548
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:06,610
Go, go, go!

2549
01:45:06,990 --> 01:45:07,370
Sorry.

2550
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:08,610
Oh no.

2551
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,540
Dang it.

2552
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,440
I pressed, I pressed the wrong key.

2553
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,500
Out of desperation.

2554
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:22,600
The red guys are canonically robots based on the game's lore.

2555
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,620
No, wait, there's lore in this.

2556
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:29,940
Oh, this level is not as easy as I think it would be.

2557
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:33,960
This level is a little more tricky than meets the eye.

2558
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,300
And you see this guy right here?

2559
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:39,660
I think that's where the door will appear.

2560
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,940
Because then you have to go all the way up here to get into it.

2561
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,560
That is my sneaking... Oh, actually, no.

2562
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:48,480
Probably not.

2563
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:48,780
Oh wait.

2564
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:50,980
No, you have to go up here to go to this one anyway.

2565
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:51,500
Never mind.

2566
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:52,180
Just kidding.

2567
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:59,070
Bomberman's an NES version.

2568
01:45:59,350 --> 01:45:59,670
Really?

2569
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:00,830
Wait.

2570
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:01,230
Oh.

2571
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,390
Oh.

2572
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:02,830
You know what?

2573
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:03,570
I'm just gonna keep running.

2574
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:08,450
You guys didn't take any of my money, did you?

2575
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:11,530
Actually, it will probably be...

2576
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:15,070
On that, in the far right.

2577
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:17,910
I probably will have to run all the way over there.

2578
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:21,510
It really hates these stairs.

2579
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:31,980
The music really hates it.

2580
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,380
Oh my gosh, they keep dropping my loot!

2581
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:41,830
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, blast.

2582
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:43,610
And blast.

2583
01:46:43,870 --> 01:46:44,230
Oh, sh...

2584
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:44,630
Ow!

2585
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:53,630
Is it possible to get the cursor icon here?

2586
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:54,530
It's...

2587
01:46:54,530 --> 01:46:55,270
Thank you!

2588
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:56,950
Oh gosh, it was like...

2589
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,930
Way back when I...

2590
01:46:58,930 --> 01:47:00,390
It was like a...

2591
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:02,930
It was like a long, long time ago.

2592
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:06,890
It was...

2593
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:08,990
Um...

2594
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:10,110
When I like...

2595
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:11,390
Came back...

2596
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:12,450
When I...

2597
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,210
Redebute...

2598
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:15,710
So I'm sorry.

2599
01:47:15,890 --> 01:47:16,770
I don't remember...

2600
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:17,970
Who the cursor...

2601
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:19,210
Who the artist was.

2602
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:19,810
Or the cursor.

2603
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:25,450
This games look like it'd be really fun to watch a speedrunner beat it.

2604
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:25,950
Right!

2605
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:26,690
I agree.

2606
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:37,430
Okay.

2607
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:38,850
This part...

2608
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:39,750
What are you...

2609
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:40,510
Where are you going?

2610
01:47:40,510 --> 01:47:41,530
Excuse you!

2611
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:45,890
He is finding his own way.

2612
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:48,770
I cannot get over how the music sounds in this part.

2613
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:49,290
It's so funny.

2614
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,070
Beep!

2615
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,750
I don't know why it hates it so much.

2616
01:48:00,870 --> 01:48:02,170
It's so funny though.

2617
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:06,890
Okay, they can't get me.

2618
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,430
They can't get me there.

2619
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:14,430
And they're too stupid to go any higher.

2620
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:16,990
The guy over there is having his own dance party.

2621
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:18,570
On the far left.

2622
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:19,510
So we're fine.

2623
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:21,930
I thought it was my connection.

2624
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:22,270
Nope!

2625
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:24,930
Random tinnitus.

2626
01:48:26,150 --> 01:48:26,590
Beep!

2627
01:48:29,970 --> 01:48:32,390
Okay, how do I want to go on my own dance?

2628
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:32,630
Yes.

2629
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:36,130
Oh, he keeps picking it up and dropping it.

2630
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:37,370
What a little...

2631
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:43,190
Oh wait though.

2632
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,930
Oh my gosh.

2633
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:44,650
I just realized.

2634
01:48:44,990 --> 01:48:46,130
How am I supposed to...

2635
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:50,150
How am I supposed to...

2636
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:51,110
Get back up there?

2637
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,890
Wait.

2638
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:52,910
No, no, no.

2639
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:55,670
He killed me!

2640
01:48:58,670 --> 01:48:59,250
Wait.

2641
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,790
I have to do this one first.

2642
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,930
Oh my gosh.

2643
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:04,610
I have to do this one first.

2644
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:05,390
Over here.

2645
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:06,110
On the left.

2646
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,620
Get out, plane.

2647
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:14,960
On the right side.

2648
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,380
No!

2649
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,060
Oh, I could fall on...

2650
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:25,300
I could go up and then fall onto it.

2651
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:26,080
Okay, that's true.

2652
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:26,540
That's true.

2653
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:27,600
Okay, okay, okay.

2654
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:31,620
Cause I was gonna say, like how the hell am I supposed to...

2655
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,380
We're getting new sound effects each time.

2656
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:46,910
It's becoming pee pee music for real.

2657
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:55,550
Now, how are they gonna get me?

2658
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:14,680
Nice.

2659
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:15,580
Oh.

2660
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:18,380
Uh oh.

2661
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,140
Not nice.

2662
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:19,540
Oh!

2663
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:20,080
Oh!

2664
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:20,860
Ow!

2665
01:50:21,180 --> 01:50:21,400
Ow!

2666
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:23,260
Ow!

2667
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,020
Blow on the cartridge.

2668
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:32,850
Wait.

2669
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,170
Give me one second, you guys.

2670
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:37,170
Okay.

2671
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:37,550
Wait.

2672
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:41,740
One moment.

2673
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,900
One second.

2674
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,420
Time zones are so confusing.

2675
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:12,020
Oh.

2676
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:13,580
Wait.

2677
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:51,030
Well, this was fun.

2678
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:52,990
I did enjoy it a lot.

2679
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:54,030
I'm glad that we could play.

2680
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:56,990
Sorry, I'm...

2681
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:57,990
I have a...

2682
01:51:57,990 --> 01:52:00,110
A little something something going on.

2683
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:01,350
So...

2684
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:02,130
Time...

2685
01:52:02,130 --> 01:52:03,010
I thought...

2686
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:04,770
I got the times all wrong.

2687
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:06,490
I put it wrong in my...

2688
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:10,170
I put it wrong in my...

2689
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:11,830
Thanks for the stream, everybody!

2690
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:15,650
I thought it was in an hour from now.

2691
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,710
That's okay.

2692
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:18,050
Um...

2693
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:18,330
Uh...

2694
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:18,530
Yeah.

2695
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:20,810
Thank you, everybody!

2696
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:22,010
Control S.

2697
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:22,530
What's that?

2698
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:23,130
Oh, I'm scared.

2699
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:23,990
What is it gonna do?

2700
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:24,630
I'm scared!

2701
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:26,190
Thank you for the fun stream.

2702
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:27,070
Have a good something something.

2703
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:27,870
Thank you!

2704
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:29,570
This...

2705
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:34,290
I'm so sorry to end so abruptly.

2706
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:36,250
Thank you, guys.

2707
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:37,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2708
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:38,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2709
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:39,530
This is fun.

2710
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:42,170
Thank you for letting me be a little boomer sometimes.

2711
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:42,530
Okay.

2712
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:44,230
Control S is saved.

2713
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:52,310
I don't...

2714
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,350
I can't read it.

2715
01:52:53,710 --> 01:52:55,010
I already exited out.

2716
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:55,390
Okay.

2717
01:52:55,630 --> 01:52:56,110
I hope...

2718
01:52:56,110 --> 01:52:56,790
I hope this works.

2719
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:57,210
Wait.

2720
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:57,870
Where'd my cursor go?

2721
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,110
Okay.

2722
01:52:58,390 --> 01:52:58,690
Okay!

2723
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:00,990
Thank you, everybody!

2724
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:03,490
Bye-bye!

2725
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:03,970
Bye-bye!

2726
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:04,530
Bye-bye!

2727
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:05,970
Thank you!

2728
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:07,650
Have a good day!

2729
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:08,450
Have a good night!

2730
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:09,230
I'll see you later!

2731
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:09,710
Bye!

2732
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:10,470
I'm so sorry!

2733
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:11,790
Again for ending so abruptly.

2734
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:13,590
Bye!

2735
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:15,090
Bye!
