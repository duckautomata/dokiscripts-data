Hello!

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:45,690
Hello!

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,130
Hello!

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,790
Hello!

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,410

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:54,590
Hello!

12
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,330
Who came back?

13
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,130
Oh, wait, yeah, let me reply.

14
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,670
Let me write up my tweet back for those confused.

15
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:15,670
Um, I donated to Iron Mouse's, uh, um, Immune Deficiency Foundation, Tiltify, and, uh, uh, Doki Bird just couldn't let my funny stay.

16
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,670
Hold on.

17
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,430
I'm replying to her.

18
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,210
Wait, where is she?

19
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,330
Doki Bird.

20
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,610
Okay.

21
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,490
There we go.

22
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, here we go.

23
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
Anyway, welcome!

24
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,060
Bit warm, though.

25
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Yeah.

26
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Hot dog.

27
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,480
Hot dog!

28
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,040
Not the 169.

29
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,200
What's her funny?

30
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,600
So, I, she donated $10,000, and I was like, I wonder if I can do 10,001 cents.

31
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,640
And it let me.

32
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,810
And, um,

33
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:28,270
uh, um, and then she, uh, and then she did, uh, she added an additional $1,000, and 69 cents to top me.

34
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,390
Not top me, one-up me.

35
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:40,150
So, I, uh, responded to her on Twitter and, you know, told her that she had to pay for the privilege to do so.

36
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,150
To do so.

37
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,790
I don't like you.

38
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,210
Love you, Arca!

39
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:59,210
Uh, but, um, yeah, uh, uh, whole situation kind of sucks.

40
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:28,210
Um, I debated saying this, but, um, guys, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,

41
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,720
um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,

43
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:19,790
I never got paid for even the merch when I did the podcast, so... yeah... and um... for those who are very confused...

44
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:48,650
I don't know who wouldn't know at this point... but um... Ironmouse put out a video... why she left to be Shoujo... and... um... and uh... it's not good... it's not good... at all... it's very bad... um... pretty much all the members have... have... have... have... talked about it... and uh...

45
00:08:50,410 --> 00:09:06,510
um... uh... people that were going to join... have talked about it... um... uh... not really... um...

46
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,780
uh...

47
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:29,300
you know... like I said, I will... give... many more details...

48
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:54,780
um... later on... so I don't want people to... I want to... try to have people avoid speculation... or anything like that... um... but uh... you know... I had... a lot of things... lined up... and... um... probably a lot of them are... not gonna happen...

49
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,880
uh...

50
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,500

uh...

54
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
it's just been really stressful...

55
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,640

I don't...

101
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,180
I don't It's been a stressful couple of weeks, let's just say that.

102
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,940
It's been a stressful couple of weeks.

103
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,920
Oh, sorry.

104
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
Oh, my hands are shaking.

105
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,060
Bye.

106
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,330
No!

107
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,650
My tea just spilled all over me.

108
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,590
Wait.

109
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,940
I'm gonna go get a towel.

110
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,980
I'll be right back.

111
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,440
Ugh!

112
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,700
Okay!

113
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,180
Okay, I got that off my chest a little bit.

114
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,060
I...

115
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,940
Originally wasn't gonna say anything.

116
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,240
And just kind of let...

117
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,180
Bygones be bygones, but...

118
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Or at least handle as much as I could in the background.

119
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,300
Cause I don't like to...

120
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,620
Bring this stuff up and...

121
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,940
Have you guys...

122
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,840
Worry about it at all.

123
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,500
But...

124
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
I just kind of kept getting more...

125
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,800
I kind of kept getting more...

126
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,340
Uh...

127
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,660
Frustrated...

128
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,260
At the fact that...

129
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,320
Um...

130
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,760
I felt like it would affect you guys...

131
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,260
If...

132
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,740
If I...

133
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
You know, I'm like...

134
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,460
Big thing's coming!

135
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,260
And then nothing...

136
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,260
Nothing ever came, so...

137
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,640
Um...

138
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,410
That's kind of where I...

139
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,940
Why I decided to say anything.

140
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,040
It's like...

141
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,240
Like I said, I originally was like...

142
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
It'll just be better to...

143
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,240
It'll just be better to...

144
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,380
I will say more and I'll...

145
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,520
I'll give you guys...

146
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,240
I will give you guys more details...

147
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,980
On everything.

148
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,360
Just, uh...

149
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,260
Um...

150
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,400
Yeah...

151
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,220
For now, that's all I can tell you.

152
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,320
Yeah...

153
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,200
I think...

154
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,930
I think...

155
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,970
I think everybody from heaven...

156
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,710
Is cursed...

157
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,070
All I can do is laugh!

158
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,440
What...

159
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,160
What the helly?

160
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,470
Sorry, I'm eating my bobo.

161
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,670
I was like, I'm not gonna get bubble tea.

162
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,170
I'm not gonna get bubble tea.

163
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,350
I craved...

164
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,350
No, caved.

165
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:52,990
Sorry.

166
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,710
I caved because I craved.

167
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,110
Anyways, welcome guys back.

168
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,710
Hey, you too, welcome back.

169
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,230
Today we're playing more Blade Runner.

170
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,770
We're good.

171
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,330
Um...

172
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,270
We...

173
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,950
Are...

174
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:11,930
Back...

175
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,470
So, before...

176
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,710
I played...

177
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,370
Let's see...

178
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,190
Recap...

179
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,070
What happened?

180
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,770
Grave diving?

181
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,800
Um...

182
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,910
We...

183
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,910
Very...

184
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,600
Um...

185
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,890
Last time we...

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,180
We...

187
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,920
What's the word?

188
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,680
Went to...

189
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Uh...

190
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,760
No, I went to...

191
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,300
Uh...

192
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,960
We are...

193
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,760
We are McCoy.

194
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,740
And we're the sharpest shooter in the...

195
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:46,840
Big...

196
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,140
Holy cow, that scared me.

197
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,360
Oh my gosh.

198
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,340
Thank you!

199
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,340
Um...

200
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,260
I'm trying...

201
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,940
I see you guys are sending me lots of stuff and I'm purposefully not reading it because I don't want to cry.

202
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,720
Ah!

203
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,400
Hold on, I'm gonna turn that down.

204
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,520
Why is it so loud?

205
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,640
Never used to be so loud.

206
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,580
Uh...

207
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,820
Da da da da da da da da da da da da.

208
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,440
Uh...

209
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,400
I...

210
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,280
I actually...

211
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,880
I clicked out of the thing.

212
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,580
Ah la la la la.

213
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Ah la la la la.

214
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:24,400
Oh.

215
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,540
There.

216
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,200
Uh...

217
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,680
Login.

218
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,840
Uh...

219
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,260
Login.

220
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,480
Login.

221
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,280
Login.

222
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,700
Login.

223
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,120
Login.

224
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,880
Licks your tears like Bruno...

225
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,220
Who?

226
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,980
Buserati.

227
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,420
Licks sweat.

228
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
Bruno Mars?

229
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,300
It's a JoJo's reference.

230
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,140
Girl, get out of here.

231
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,740
Okay, hold on.

232
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,440
Uh...

233
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,060
And then I go to here.

234
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
And then I turn it...

235
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,580
No.

236
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,100
I go to alert box.

237
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,120
And then I turn it down.

238
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,120
I was on...

239
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,760
I was on Camilla's stream today.

240
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,100
And...

241
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,880
Um...

242
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,080
She told me not to use...

243
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,360
Well, she didn't tell me not to use it.

244
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,920
But she said she doesn't use stream labs anymore.

245
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
She uses...

246
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,940
Stream elements.

247
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,840
And her stuff was so fancy.

248
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,440
Yeah, I did...

249
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,420
I did possess her.

250
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,120
I did, I did.

251
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,100
I did possess her.

252
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah, I could possess her right now if I felt like it.

253
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,660
Yeah.

254
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,940
Uh...

255
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,800
But it was a lot of fun.

256
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,840
I don't know what she does with her VODs.

257
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,640
Uh...

258
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,120
Hopefully she keeps them.

259
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,600
Normal OBS is less CPU intense.

260
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,580
No, no, I use OBS.

261
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,360
But I use stream labs for donals.

262
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,680
Yeah, that's why there's the stream labs link in the...

263
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,960
Oh, link in the description.

264
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,960
Hmm...

265
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Hmm...

266
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,440
But...

267
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,200
I don't...

268
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,300
I think...

269
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,720
I thought stream labs for donals versus stream labs OBS is different.

270
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,020
No?

271
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,780
Aren't they different?

272
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,920
I thought.

273
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,150
Stream elements is good for bot moderation.

274
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:37,630
Really?

275
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,910
Hmm...

276
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,770
It is different.

277
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,810
Oh, see?

278
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,250
I have no idea.

279
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,810
I don't...

280
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,670
I'm so stupid when it comes to all this stuff.

281
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,570
I don't know how to do anything.

282
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,990
Streaming.

283
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,650
Whatever.

284
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,270
Okay.

285
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,450
What did we do?

286
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,530
Well, okay.

287
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,990
First, there was a...

288
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,710
There was a murder spree of the animals at the questionable pet store.

289
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,110
And then...

290
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,850
There was a guy who worked at the place that's...

291
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,710
That's manufacturing...

292
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,090
Uh...

293
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,530
Stuff.

294
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,450
Robots.

295
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,550
And...

296
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,350
That guy...

297
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,490
He was in anti-gravity and he died too.

298
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,670
Tyrell.

299
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,670
Tyrell.

300
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,830
Happy you already.

302
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,730
Thank you!

303
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,050
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

304
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,490
Pro streamer.

305
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,510
I'm not a pro!

306
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,410
I'm not...

307
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,370
I'm not a pro!

308
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,510
I don't know what I'm doing.

309
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,190
I'm only five years old.

310
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:48,810
Uh...

311
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,710
Yeah, Hannibal too!

312
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,510
Then we went to that guy and he was like...

313
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,870
Some...

314
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,850
He was a guy in a really chilly room.

315
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,190
And then there was another guy...

316
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,510
Oh, and it was the...

317
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,930
It was...

318
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,070
Some replicant that killed the guy at Tyrell Corporation.

319
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,450
Sorry, this is the worst description ever.

320
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,250
My brain is...

321
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,260
You are the youngest person ever!

322
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,620
How old are you?

323
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm five years old!

324
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,490
And, uh...

325
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,690
Mumbles in Chinese.

326
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,590
Exactly.

327
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,270
And then there was an explosion!

328
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,570
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

329
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,730
And before the guy died, he was like, Go to the twins!

330
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,130
And we went to a really creepy dollhouse.

331
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,250
Hated that.

332
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,210
And now we woke up in an apartment.

333
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,370
And...

334
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,430
As Mint watched the film...

335
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,430
Uh, when I was like...

336
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,170
Two wisps old!

337
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:47,870
Jeez!

338
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,730
It's fine, I'm having fun.

339
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,850
This is where I'm at.

340
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,430
Yes.

341
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,410
Wait a second.

342
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,510
The Bradbury building.

343
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,850
I wanna look around here a little bit before...

344
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,050
Let's actually start here, and then we can watch the cutscene from before.

345
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,230
That...

346
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,430
That we ended on.

347
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,670
I think that would be good.

348
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,490
This creepy-ass building!

349
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,730
I hate in here.

350
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,110
This place scares me.

351
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,970
This place is so scary!

352
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,650
Run!

353
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,250
And then there's creepy walking dolls around here.

354
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,450
Hate, hate, hate.

355
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,210
Hate, hate, hate, hate.

356
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,490
I feel like I did not view everything...

357
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:37,930
In here.

358
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,490
This is how we go upstairs, but I don't wanna do that.

359
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:41,950
Wait.

360
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,430
Is this where I came from?

361
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,110
Yeah.

362
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,310
Wait a second.

363
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:45,810
Ah!

364
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,490
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,550
How do I...

366
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,490
There was other rooms.

367
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,270
Was it upstairs?

368
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,010
Pshow!

369
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,410
Brr!

370
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:05,950
Brr!

371
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,810
I guess so.

372
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,090
Cause there's nowhere else for me to go.

373
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,210
Uppies!

374
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,390
Uppies!

375
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,220
Sorry!

376
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,340
Nevermind, we get the cut soon.

377
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,280
Okay, nevermind, we don't get to explore.

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,740
This is so sad.

379
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,420
I'm getting my ass kicked again.

380
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,180
I got yeeted!

381
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,800
That guy...

382
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,740
That guy's crazy!

383
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,700
What do you think he found us, man?

384
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,760
One of the design subcons must have talked.

385
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,540
Unstable personalities, to say the least.

386
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,320
It's creepy in the movie too.

387
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,280
The old block.

388
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,120
It would've created problems down the line.

389
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,100
We got problem now, man.

390
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,580
This one?

391
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,220
He's not a problem.

392
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,540
He's...

393
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,820
An opportunity.

394
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,620
You're weak, my friend.

395
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,820
I expected so much more from you.

396
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,720
Are you gonna kiss me?

397
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,880
Thinking our brother not hearing too good.

398
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,340
Yeah, I wonder why.

399
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,280
Oh, he hears us.

400
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,200
Isn't that right, McCoy?

401
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,220
You ready to give up fruitless nightmare, man?

402
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,000
Come back to family?

403
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,180
He doesn't have a choice.

404
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,900
He never did.

405
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,840
Wait, are we a replicant?

406
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,180
Let me kill him, man.

407
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,720
No.

408
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,080
We got no time to be patient.

409
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,560
Your woman, she be getting sick.

410
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,140
I promise you, she'll not die here on Earth.

411
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,920
I promise somebody will.

412
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,620
Believe me, he's the least of our problems.

413
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,840
You're talking crazy.

414
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,820
The hunter be dangerous.

415
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,720
A fool sees not the same tree a wise man sees.

416
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,400
I'm no fool, man.

417
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,320
You must have a little faith, my friend.

418
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,460
He said come back to family.

419
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,780
Without contraries is no progression.

420
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,620
How can you trust any of their kind?

421
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,160
We have been manipulated by them, correct?

422
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,820
Or maybe we're not.

423
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,260
Now they're going to see exactly what lies on the other side of the horizon.

424
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,780
Unless our kind means...

425
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,020
The po-po.

426
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,720
Oh, wait!

427
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,260
The word!

428
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,720
Sorry.

429
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,500
The thing I remember the most.

430
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,260
Lucy!

431
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:22,940
Right?

432
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,680
Lucy.

433
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,080
I believe.

434
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,140
How long have I been here, Lucy?

435
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,440
The man...

436
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,200
How do you know my name?

437
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,080
I saw your things at Runciter's.

438
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,840
Did you feel bad when they killed those animals?

439
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,580
They were so pretty and sweet.

440
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,980
I hoped father wouldn't do it.

441
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,260
But Mr. Runciter deserved retribution.

442
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,840
That's what father said.

443
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,040
Why?

444
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,540
Yeah, that guy kind of sucked.

445
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
Because...

446
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,780
He treated me...

447
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,560
Bad.

448
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,620
Like I belong to him.

449
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,520
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,840
Are you really the hunter?

451
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,340
Like father says?

452
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,920
It's my job.

453
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,480
Why?

454
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,640
What do you have against us?

455
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,320
Nothing, it's just...

456
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
The law.

457
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,820
Would you hurt me?

458
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,780
I promise you I won't.

459
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,920
A little chook.

460
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,080
A little chook.

461
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,900
Father will be back soon.

462
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,120
A little chook.

463
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,600
A little chook...

464
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,780
And this is where we ended before, give me one second...

465
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,940
Okay, we're trapped in our little chair.

466
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,380
This is... what actually do we do here?

467
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,220
Oh wait!

468
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,520
Something green?

469
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,900
Go!

470
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,560
You can do it!

471
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,460
McCoy!

472
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,840
Walk

473
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,040
500 miles and I would walk 500 more...

474
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,860
Just to be the man that walked a thousand miles through...

475
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,760
At your door...

476
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,360
He

477
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,330
didn't even move at me!

478
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,470
I think we actually have to leave.

479
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,190
Oh shoot, okay.

480
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,410
This way?

481
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,150
Where are we?

482
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,370
Just kidding.

483
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,670
Pick that!

484
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,100
Hold on.

485
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,660
Once we stop moving...

486
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,720
Do we have anything?

487
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,220
Oh, I guess...

488
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,980
No actual stuff, okay.

489
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,340
Maybe...

490
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,760
Maybe this steam...

491
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,880
Jump diagonally!

492
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,700
Thank you, Scarlet.

493
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,460
Oh, that was me, not the steam!

494
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,000
What are we supposed to do here?

495
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,700
This way!

496
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,140
Go back!

497
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,400
I should've pulled up the walkthrough.

498
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm a dummy dumb.

499
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,560
Is this a door?

500
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,380
Open...

501
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,480
Grab this!

502
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:50,960
Please!

503
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,700
I can't!

504
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,500
And this!

505
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,060
This too!

506
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,220
Grab the teddy bear!

507
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,060
Go!

508
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:57,460
Go!

509
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,060
I'm clicking on the teddy bear.

510
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,720
I don't know why...

511
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,860
I don't know why he's going all the way over there!

512
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,460
Oh!

513
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,940
He's...

514
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,060
Blair Witching himself!

515
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:07,900
Why?

516
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,340
Maybe I clicked too many times.

517
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,900
Uh oh, I'm not clicking anymore.

518
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,380
McCoy?

519
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

520
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,220
Uh...

521
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,400
Oh, okay.

522
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:26,900
Here we go.

523
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Ha ha ha!

524
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Go!

525
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,440
Go!

526
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:29,680
Go!

527
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,460
Over here.

528
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,540
I don't know how to click over to the bear though.

529
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:34,980
Oh, here we go.

530
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,600
Here we go!

531
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:35,980
Here we go!

532
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,440
Here we go!

533
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,020
Progress!

534
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,340
Surely he'll be able to pick this up and surely there is a knife in there.

535
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,000
No!

536
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,640
Oh!

537
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,500
You can see how many times I've clicked on it.

538
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,060
Okay, hold on.

539
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,140
Ha ha ha ha ha.

540
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,880
Ha ha ha ha.

541
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,220
Are his legs cuffed?

542
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,800
Ha ha ha.

543
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,100
Can you just stand up?

544
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,520
I don't know.

545
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,360
Ha ha ha.

546
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,700
Ha ha ha.

547
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,660
I'm going to...

548
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,240
Ha ha ha ha.

549
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
I'm going to get the walk-through up.

550
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

551
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,300
Ha ha ha!

552
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,480
Uh...

553
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:08,680
Uh...

554
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Blair Witch...

555
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,100
No.

556
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:10,840
No, but sorry!

557
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,000
Blade!

558
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,190
Uh...

559
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,590
Blade Runner walk-through.

560
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,260
Ha ha ha ha ha.

561
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,460
Ah...

562
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,860
We're...

563
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,000
We're at... we're, I think, at Act 3, or we're just about to hit Act 3.

564
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,800
I would like to... finish the game today.

565
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,300
So, that's why I might rely a little bit on the walkthrough, or maybe... you guys.

566
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,280
Go back to the Blair Witch and click on him to cut the rope.

567
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,020
No kidding!

568
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,160
Are you... really?

569
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh wait, there is a thing here!

570
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,720
It's so dark, how are you supposed to see it?

571
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh my gosh, thank you, Strike.

572
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,520
Click.

573
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,680
No?

574
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,740
Eh?

575
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,180
Oh,

576
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,200
wow!

577
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,440
Okay, let's save the game.

578
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,700
Oh, what the... what is... what...

579
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,780
I hacked.

580
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,280
I bought this game from Steam.

581
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,800
Save game.

582
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,720
Sure, sorry.

583
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,280
Resume game, okay.

584
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,120
Nope, no, no, no, no, no.

585
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,100
This, this, this.

586
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,440
It felt and smelled like real cheese.

587
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,620
Dairy products were choice contraband.

588
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,380
Scarce and mucho expensive.

589
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,300
Selling them was a Class A felony.

590
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,900
No kidding, no kidding.

591
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We got some cheese.

592
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
Over here.

593
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,840
Okay, I guess we do have to go.

594
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,240
Pizza!

595
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,100
Money.

596
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,220
All right, dog.

597
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,520
All right, dog.

598
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,660
Hysteria Hall was an arcade, down near Nightclub Row.

599
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,760
Nothing else there.

600
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,360
Strange.

601
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,280
What, what was it?

602
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,320
Don't just say strange.

603
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,540
Explain what it is.

604
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,200
Nothing else there.

605
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,160
Explain what it is.

606
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,400
Okay, let's go this way.

607
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,780
I'm gonna get my gun out first.

608
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,220
You let him in my room?

609
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,540
They had a warrant, mister.

610
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,660
What was I supposed to do?

611
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,320
They.

612
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,100
Took.

613
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:22,940
My.

614
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:23,800
Pictures.

615
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,120
Couldn't stop them!

616
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,240
How about me?

617
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,220
You think I'm easier to stop?

618
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,380
Uh...

619
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,300
Who the hell are you?

620
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,640
Oh.

621
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,000
McCoy, LPD.

622
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,520
Uh-oh.

623
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,540
LPD, huh?

624
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,260
Maybe you guys can return something to me.

625
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,720
Haha, just put bye.

626
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,700
How do you know we got it?

627
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,160
How?

628
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,060
One of your own.

629
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,680
Vade of my property.

630
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,620
Bad haircut.

631
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,080
Stupid coat.

632
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:44,920
It's...

633
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,560
The other guy.

634
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,680
What other guy?

635
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,480
What's his name, Gruz?

636
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,080
Don't play dumb.

637
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,860
Don't play dumb.

638
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,320
What about him?

639
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,660
Nothing.

640
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,680
I just thought you were gonna arrest me, that's all.

641
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,780
I don't care about your little run-in with the manager, okay?

642
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,520
I'm looking for a couple of replicants.

643
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,700
Can't help you there, friend.

644
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Yeah, Guzman, Guzman.

645
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,840
Maybe the clerk can tell me who was renting that room back there.

646
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,260
Guzman?

647
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,460
Why were you hassling him?

648
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,540
He left these creeps in my room.

649
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm a very private person.

650
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,080
What have they got against you?

651
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,660
Not the creeps.

652
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,640
Nothing, friend.

653
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,160
I ain't done nothing.

654
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,200
Friend?

655
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,480
We're all innocents, aren't we?

656
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,040
That's the most suspicious thing.

657
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,440
Not like people asking questions either.

658
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,480
Just help me out here a little more.

659
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,340
You seen a big Rasta guy around here?

660
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,980
Or a guy with a beard and dark eyes?

661
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,860
A Rasta?

662
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,720
What's that?

663
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,300
He's got dreadlocks.

664
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,260
Talks with an accent.

665
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,180
Oh.

666
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,620
No, I ain't seen no one like that.

667
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,700
Look.

668
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,900
My mother's waiting for me.

669
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,300
You stick around.

670
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,760
Maybe the manager will come back.

671
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,060
Wait, where did he go?

672
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,280
Is this a dog?

673
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,460
I've been looking at it the whole time.

674
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:47,840
Bing, bing!

675
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,870
Wait, this place seems kinda big.

676
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,670
We got over here?

677
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,390
Whoa!

678
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,450
I didn't know who was working this side of the pool.

679
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,370
But whoever it was, they'd been pretty thorough going through the joint.

680
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,410
I doubted if there was anything I could find that hadn't already been snagged and bagged.

681
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,790
Snagged and bagged.

682
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,070
Wait, but what is this place?

683
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,150
Oh, we got...

684
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,330
Something.

685
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,630
And we got...

686
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:20,930
Nothing.

687
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:21,550
Nothing.

688
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,390
Thanks for clarifying, officer.

689
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,930
Chill!

690
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:27,950
Thank you!

691
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,790
Thank you, guys.

692
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:31,830
Really...

693
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:32,570
Nothing.

694
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,610
Appreciate it.

695
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,390
Don't feel like you have to donate or anything.

696
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,030
Please.

697
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,230
It's the last thing I want.

698
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,310
Oh,

699
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,960
what happened to the dock?

700
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,780
Oh my god!

701
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,380
They...

702
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:51,720
They...

703
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,180
This is what happened...

704
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,120
Back to the Future 6.

705
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,540
Oh...

706
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,360
Crossover with Blade Runner.

707
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,020
Nooo!

708
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,360
Oh my god!

709
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,150
Gotcha for...

710
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,570
Hot Dog.

711
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,890
Not Hot Dog.

712
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,250
What, are my chews not good enough for you?

713
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:19,810
Wait a second.

714
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,210
Before we go...

715
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,050
Because there was some stuff in the rooms, too.

716
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,230
There was one more room.

717
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,890
I didn't realize that this would go downstairs.

718
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,370
This room here.

719
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:30,770
Oh!

720
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,850
Oh my gosh!

721
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,830
We're here!

722
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,010
Wait...

723
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,810
Oh my god.

724
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,410
Oh my god!

725
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,910
If we made a whole circle...

726
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,230
This is where that got...

727
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,030
If we keep going, we'll head...

728
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,970
We'll be at...

729
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,290
We'll be at sushi!

730
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,390
Oh sh...

731
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,030
Oh gosh...

732
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,090
I didn't mean to go down the stairs.

733
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:53,950
He's so slow.

734
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:55,970
Come

735
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,900
on, you're the five gifted dog!

736
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,100
Okay...

737
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,860
Let's go back.

738
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,760
We'll...

739
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,280
We'll...

740
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,080
Keep going this way then.

741
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,620
Okay...

742
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,220
Ever injured yourself eating pizza?

743
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,640
Oh!

744
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,960
It's like scratching your throat with the crust?

745
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,060
Yeah...

746
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,220
I have done that before.

747
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,820
Crazy...

748
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:22,680
Okay...

749
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,200
I can't take the keys or anything.

750
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,420
Doesn't seem there's so much in here.

751
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,860
I will save so we don't have to go through all that again.

752
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,260
And...

753
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,580
Yeah, we'll just override this.

754
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,720
And...

755
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,060
Um...

756
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,420
Are we gonna explore the car?

757
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,160
Or...

758
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,140
The car looked a lot like the one I'd been tracking.

759
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,080
The driver had been smart enough to pull the license plate, but the vehicle identification number was still there.

760
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,300
Not the VIN!

761
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,560
If I ran it through the mainframe back at the station, I could ID the owner.

762
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,660
Ah!

763
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,020
We have that then!

764
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,260
Ripper Odie and Cheese, brother!

765
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,040
Oh, we have two places we can go.

766
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,820
Let's try this way.

767
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,820
We're here!

768
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,400
Oh my gosh!

769
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,220
Okay...

770
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,200
And then what's this way?

771
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,780
This is maybe sushi?

772
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,340
Sushi!

773
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,560
Oh, it's so far away.

774
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,080
Yeah!

775
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,080
We're at sushi!

776
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Oh my gosh!

777
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,200
We made like the biggest circle ever.

778
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,880
What, LA's like...

779
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,340
Two feet wide?

780
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,220
What is this?

781
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,160
2019 LA is really walkable.

782
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,480
Yeah.

783
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,700
Clearly.

784
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,300
I need to ask you...

785
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,100
McCoy, be more assertive!

786
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,940
Assume myself...

787
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,200
Uh...

788
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,380
Uh...

789
00:38:59,380 --> 00:38:59,800
Onisha!

790
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,540
Ray McCoy.

791
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,420
Repeat that.

792
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,580
Be more assertive, Mr...

793
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:04,780
Okay.

794
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,820
Where's our car?

795
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,320
Where did we leave it?

796
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,640
Where did we park our car at?

797
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,340
Uh...

798
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,540
Longtime lurker!

799
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:14,900
Wow!

800
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,480
Thank you so much for the...

801
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,860
Pink!

802
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,420
Ah!

803
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,220
Ah!

804
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,200
Excuse me, pal.

805
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,460
Oh, okay.

806
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,880
I thought he was gonna come to kill me.

807
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,620
Just kidding.

808
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,660
Wait, no.

809
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,300
Okay.

810
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,300
Our car...

811
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,620
Uh...

812
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,940
Where would it be?

813
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,060
Hey, pal.

814
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,980
You could've done something when that goon had me by the throat.

815
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,860
Call the cops, at least.

816
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,780
I am the cops!

817
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,440
You're still walking and breathing, aren't you?

818
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,000
Damn!

819
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,760
That ain't the point.

820
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,180
You scratch our back, we'll scratch yours.

821
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,160
Nice friggin' policy.

822
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,720
You don't like it?

823
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,000
Get a permit somewhere else.

824
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,460
Lousy cops.

825
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,700
Lousy cops.

826
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,280
Down the hall, on your left.

827
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,540
What?

828
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,020
You're a cop, right?

829
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,580
Your buddies have already been here.

830
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,240
Room 27.

831
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,220
What were they doing here?

832
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,260
I don't ask a lot of questions when a badge is shoved in my face.

833
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,240
You have a big guy with a strange-looking mustache staying here?

834
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:08,860
DNA row?

835
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,860
He worked at Howie Lee's around the corner.

836
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,160
Okay.

837
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,340
Thank you.

838
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,660
We'll go check the- I don't break a lot of bread with the class of people that pass through here.

839
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,880
But if you want to look around, check out some rooms.

840
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,400
I break fast.

841
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:18,980
Be my guest.

842
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,220
Yo, this place is a dump, mister!

843
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,960
The room I stayed in, it's leaking!

844
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,820
Did we get everything in this room, now that I think about it?

845
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,800
There was just this drawer.

846
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
Sorry, I came back here.

847
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,900
I think so.

848
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,120
And we got something mysterious in there.

849
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,080
I don't know what it was.

850
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,320
How did I get to...

851
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,280
Uh...

852
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
I think it was outside.

853
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,460
Right?

854
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,820
And then we went here.

855
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:52,860
There.

856
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,920
And this should be DNA.

857
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,480
You can ring the bell while you're standing there, can you?

858
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,360
Excuse me, pal.

859
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,820
My name is Nancy McCoy Drew.

860
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,000
We're just walking.

861
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,220
We're just walking.

862
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,220
Okay.

863
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,460
Gosh, that was the longest cutscene ever.

864
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,900
Am I too big, by the way?

865
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,780
Ah, our house!

866
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,340
I mean...

867
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,640
This is our house, yes.

868
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,660
Our...

869
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,700
Night...

870
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,260
That's right!

871
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,440
We need to go to Nightclub Row, baby!

872
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,520
But...

873
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,840
He did say he wanted to run the VIN at the police station.

874
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,420
So let's do that.

875
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,560
I like Big Minky.

876
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,620
I'm big in Japan.

877
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,640
I...

878
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:43,820
I...

879
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,900
What were those shirts?

880
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,300
Do you guys remember those?

881
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,000
The I'm big in Japan shirts?

882
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,860
What the heck does that mean?

883
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,560
Ground floor.

884
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,500
Mainframe and shooting range.

885
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,180
Mainframe and shooting range.

886
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:06,060
Another retirement in the fourth sector today as a Blade Runner shot an alleged replicant in the middle of a crowded street.

887
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,540
This lady is so loud.

888
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,100
Shut up.

889
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,620
Is this the guy that'll run the VIN?

890
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,900
You keeping busy, pal?

891
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,580
Hey!

892
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,960
Nah, the place has been pretty quiet the last couple of days.

893
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,020
Where can I run the VIN?

894
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,000
In the...

895
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,460
In this room?

896
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,860
In here?

897
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,840
The esper?

898
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,420
The esper...

899
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,080
It was a song.

900
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,900
Oh, was it?

901
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,350
What?

902
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:29,890
Moon bus.

903
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,230
Moon bus!

904
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:31,970
Whoa!

905
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,590
Guess you could say...

906
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,610
Being nosy for new punk rock.

907
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,190
Oh, what is this vampire?

908
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,470
Moon bus.

909
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,510
A moon bus?

910
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,500
That guy sure gets around.

911
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,880
Give me a hard copy of that.

912
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,240
Tell me why ain't nothing but I'm...

913
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,700
Oh, I can't zoom in on the other guy?

914
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,400
Harding.

915
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,380
Tell me why...

916
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,380
Ain't nothing but I'm missing.

917
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,420
Tell me why...

918
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,520
I never wanna hear you say...

919
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,480
Who's this?

920
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,420
Wait, that's a person!

921
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,640
Wait!

922
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,560
I just...

923
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,780
I didn't know what I was looking at.

924
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,060
Um...

925
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,680
Uh...

926
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,580
Oh, there were some people concerned about me doing karaoke.

927
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,340
Um...

928
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,500
Karaoke for my, uh...

929
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,280
For my anniversary.

930
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,020
But it won't be so long.

931
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,380
And I did get the okay to do so.

932
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,560
So...

933
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,180
Yeah.

934
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,460
It's all good.

935
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,100
Enhance.

936
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

937
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,100
Uploading personal clue database.

938
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,360
The mainframe confirmed what I'd already guessed.

939
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,460
The car from Chinatown was the same vehicle that had smacked the hydrant at Runceters.

940
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,080
The car was registered to a woman named Dektora.

941
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,840
She'd bought it from the used car lot in the fourth sector.

942
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,180
Dektora!

943
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,200
I ran the name two records and came up empty.

944
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,280
The used car lot checked out clean, too.

945
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,260
But maybe the owner could tell me something.

946
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,100
Mm-hmm.

947
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:11,860
Dektora.

948
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,020
Dektora.

949
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,980
Remove my...

950
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,360
Replicant Inhibitors.

951
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:18,900
Dektor.

952
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,400
We got a lead, baby.

953
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,420
Oh, here it comes.

954
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,560
Roof...

955
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,360
Roof...

956
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:30,960
Roof...

957
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,660
I don't know why.

958
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,960
This just tickles my fancy.

959
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:34,860
Roof...

960
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,640
Roof...

961
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,200
Roof...

962
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,100
Roof...

963
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,020
Roof...

964
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,040
Roof...

965
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,380
Roof...

966
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:39,540
Roof.

967
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,420
We're going to the nightclub, baby.

968
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,020
I've never been to one.

969
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,660
How exciting.

970
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,520
Dektora McFly.

971
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,160
I need to watch Back to the Future 2.

972
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,460
Are you doing any drugs?

973
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,980
I'm a clean girl.

974
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,400
Sexy lighting.

975
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,920
Are we going in there?

976
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,840
Live XXX, girls.

977
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:19,960
Elevator.

978
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,820
Roof lady's voice reminds me a little of Ryo from Lifeline.

979
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,500
Don't say that.

980
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,230
Did she just say Gongaga?

981
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,070
What's the soundtrack?

982
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,190
I guess we gotta go in.

983
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:49,790
Whoa!

984
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,170
What are they doing in there?

985
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,390
A little betta fish.

986
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,160
Is there gonna be more inside?

987
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,800
Oh, wow.

988
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,760
I don't remember any of this.

989
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,820
Maybe my dad didn't leave.

990
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,820
For any of this.

991
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,440
She's doing...

992
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,080
Oh no, she's doing the sh...

993
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,920
Oh, she's doing the hurricane twist.

994
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,900
Wow, she's doing the Freddy Krueger.

995
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:42,800
Whoa!

996
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,580
Oh God, she's doing the bend over Billy.

997
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,080
Whoa!

998
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,580
Oh, spread eagle!

999
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,340
Whip around!

1000
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,300
Oh no, it's an advanced technique.

1001
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,100
Only those 10 plus years in the abyss would know.

1002
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,900
Oh my God, she does it again.

1003
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,400
Is that our girl, you think?

1004
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,780
Oh shit, I can talk to her.

1005
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,800
Sorry, I didn't mean to cry, so I'm just excited.

1006
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,540
Who is this guy?

1007
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:05,860
I...

1008
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,280
We stick out like...

1009
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,540
This place is way more, like, uh...

1010
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,100
Alternative than I imagined it would be.

1011
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,040
This here is reserved for VIPs.

1012
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,300
Oh, this.

1013
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,020
But that's my name, Vip.

1014
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,920
You're a cute boy, Alex.

1015
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,220
This here is reserved for VIPs.

1016
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,200
Uh, yeah, that's my name.

1017
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,540
He really tried.

1018
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,460
Ah, good one, McCoy.

1019
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,240
Is this the guy that just told us we couldn't go in?

1020
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:50,820
Hey, Hanoi.

1021
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,560
Where's Early?

1022
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,280
Off Wolf Fat Farm.

1023
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,180
What?

1024
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,160
You can do better than that.

1025
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,600
No, it's true.

1026
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,280
Mr. Q sent me a vid just yesterday.

1027
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,360
Getting the hell of a tan he is.

1028
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:02,900
Whoa.

1029
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,740
He's not even on this planet.

1030
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,330
Am I gonna regret this?

1031
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,850
Oh my God.

1032
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,550
Oh, I'm just standing there.

1033
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:17,730
Wait.

1034
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,850
Do I need to have like a sensor ready?

1035
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,950
Oh.

1036
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,150
This music's crazy!

1037
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,650
Let me tell you what I want.

1038
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,990
And maybe I'll impress you.

1039
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:32,490
What?

1040
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,070
How old are you?

1041
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,290
Haven't I seen you around here before?

1042
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,570
Let me tell you what I want.

1043
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,910
And maybe I'll impress you.

1044
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:45,830
Oh ho ho ho.

1045
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,510
Okay.

1046
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:49,990
How old are you?

1047
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,290
I think, okay, okay.

1048
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:51,870
Alright.

1049
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,170
He just says the same things over and over again.

1050
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,770
Sod off!

1051
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,250
You got no appointment, and you got no warrant.

1052
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:58,950
No warrant!

1053
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,110
Oh.

1054
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:03,730
Wait.

1055
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,730
This is not where I'm supposed to be.

1056
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:07,490
Maybe?

1057
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:08,210
Um...

1058
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,270
I'm looking for a...

1059
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:10,570
Wait.

1060
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:11,830
Maybe we distracted him.

1061
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:15,670
Sod off, McCoy.

1062
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:17,430
I've got no time for you.

1063
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,390
I'm gonna shoot you.

1064
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,670
I've got...

1065
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:20,230
A gun.

1066
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:21,750
Oh, no.

1067
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,830
They kicked me out!

1068
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:24,830
Because I...

1069
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:25,930
Did you see that?

1070
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:26,830
I was on the ground!

1071
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,990
They kicked me out because I pulled out!

1072
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:29,590
Oh my God!

1073
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:29,670
What?

1074
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,180
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

1075
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,060
Can I get a...

1076
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,880
Can I get one at the bar, at least?

1077
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,280
The service here sucks!

1078
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,620
Please!

1079
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,280
Pull out the gun again.

1080
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,900
Okay, hold on.

1081
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,760
I pull out the gun?

1082
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:06,960
Oh my God!

1083
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,200
They actually...

1084
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:13,640
Wow!

1085
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,980
I was expecting the subtitles to say...

1086
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,300
Speaks British for a second.

1087
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:17,540
Wait!

1088
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,280
Is it not Australian accent?

1089
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,100
Pull out two guns!

1090
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:26,460
Wait!

1091
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,400
Now I'm at a loss!

1092
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:27,920
Hold on.

1093
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,240
Let me get back to the...

1094
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,400
To the uh...

1095
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,010
I was trying to get to the...

1096
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,680
Walkthrough where we were at.

1097
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,010
Because I feel like we...

1098
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,300
Sod off as British.

1099
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,080
Oh!

1100
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,040
Okay.

1101
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:41,840
Just kidding.

1102
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,160
I don't know accents at all.

1103
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,480
I'm dead.

1104
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,060
Why not?

1105
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,560
Oh, oh, oh!

1106
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,720
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh...

1107
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,520
Oh wait!

1108
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,000
There was uh...

1109
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,440
The car shop.

1110
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,460
That's what it's telling you.

1111
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,180
I've got my gun out.

1112
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,880
I got my gun out.

1113
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,540
That's right.

1114
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,720
We had the...

1115
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,380
Maybe that's where...

1116
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:06,680
Let's see.

1117
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,980
Animal brothers.

1118
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,720
Runesitters.

1119
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,200
Brad's spirit DNA.

1120
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,440
Nightclub.

1121
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,220
Oh, Hysteria Hall?

1122
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,080
Maybe that?

1123
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,660
I don't remember.

1124
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,960
I don't remember that.

1125
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,220
Going there?

1126
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,140
Yes, this is... Oh, there it is.

1127
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,800
Used cars.

1128
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:31,500
Okay, cool, cool.

1129
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,220
Is this an arcade?

1130
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,200
It was the trickster.

1131
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,580
He said Pat doesn't have a mink coat.

1132
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,260
She's got a good Republican court coat.

1133
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,000
That's all.

1134
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,220
The trickster.

1135
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,360
You're wrong, sweetie.

1136
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,020
It was Herbert Hoover.

1137
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,320
I'm sorry, but I was there.

1138
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,320
If anything, you were all at three years old back then.

1139
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,720
I still remember it, like it was yesterday.

1140
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,100
And he said fur coat, not mink.

1141
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,260
I saw it on the Discovery Club.

1142
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,600
Minky!

1143
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,300
Are you guys still battling it out?

1144
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,800
That's what keeps America alive in kicking day.

1145
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:07,820
What do you mean?

1146
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,460
Oh, he knows, Amaga.

1147
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,860
What can we do you for?

1148
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,120
The works.

1149
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,660
Coming right up.

1150
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,980
Are we getting hot done?

1151
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,220
You know anything about politics, right?

1152
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,060
Famous quotes, things like that.

1153
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,820
I try not to.

1154
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,120
How about the checker speech?

1155
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,620
Never heard of it.

1156
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,060
Hoover's checker speech.

1157
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:25,780
What?

1158
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,860
Nixon's checker speech.

1159
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,280
You're forgetting a lot, your old age.

1160
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,260
Right behind you, lady.

1161
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,500
No way, we just got a hot dog.

1162
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,320
Is that... Oh, my bad.

1163
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,840
Is that in our inventory?

1164
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,380
Toy dog.

1165
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,380
Ooh, what a... what a photo.

1166
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,580
The car was registered to a woman named Dektora.

1167
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,360
She'd bought it from a used car lot in the fourth sector.

1168
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,680
I ran the name through records and came up empty.

1169
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,720
The used car lot checked out clean, too.

1170
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,700
But maybe the owner could tell me something.

1171
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,700
It's Nixon.

1172
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,800
Of course he doesn't know anything.

1173
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,220
Oh, let's go in the arcade.

1174
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,910
Hall of mirrors.

1175
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:18,470
Ew.

1176
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:21,710
What's in here?

1177
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,290
So much for the toy.

1178
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,370
He gave the thank you.

1179
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:30,830
Aw, yeah.

1180
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,910
Ew, I don't want to go in the hall of mirrors.

1181
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,950
Seems like that's the only thing we can do, though.

1182
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,770
Moon bus!

1183
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,530
Oh, my gosh.

1184
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,870
We found moon bus.

1185
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,980
Wait, does it let me go in here?

1186
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,520
Oh, that's the exit.

1187
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,260
I feel like I'm going to get jumped in the hall of mirrors.

1188
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,060
I'm not going to lie.

1189
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,340
I'm going to save.

1190
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,320
Let's go in.

1191
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,660
With my...

1192
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,080
With my gun out?

1193
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh.

1194
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
This is...

1195
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,540
Not what I...

1196
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,720
Uh...

1197
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,640
What?

1198
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,120
I'm so small.

1199
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,700
Oh, we're here.

1200
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,240
Oh, okay.

1201
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,460
I can't run.

1202
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,460
I can get my gun out.

1203
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,160
What's the object...

1204
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,060
Objective?

1205
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:40,800
Mirrors.

1206
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,220
Don't go.

1207
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,420
This looks more like a...

1208
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,540
Like a...

1209
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,620
Like a...

1210
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,220
Oh, my gosh.

1211
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,280
I keep wanting to say paintball, but that's not what I mean.

1212
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,900
Airsoft arena.

1213
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,820
Where the hell am I supposed to be going?

1214
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,140
Oh, I can run.

1215
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,540
Just kidding.

1216
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:02,640
Oh.

1217
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,960
I can go really fast.

1218
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:04,920
Apparently.

1219
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,780
Go, go, go, go.

1220
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,880
Uh.

1221
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,840
I thought something was green, but it was me.

1222
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,060
What the hell is this?

1223
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,720
I can just click and tell them where to go, I guess.

1224
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,700
Wait, where am I supposed to be going?

1225
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,100
I don't see anything!

1226
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,100
Ha!

1227
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:25,720
Ha!

1228
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,140
Who is this?

1229
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,120
Reminds me of laser tag.

1230
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,340
I'm assuming you don't want to get spotted by the spotlights.

1232
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,280
Suddenly Metal Gear.

1233
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,200
Can you imagine if Metal Gear played like this?

1234
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,000
I...

1235
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,560
I...

1236
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,320
I...

1237
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,640
I'm not sure we need to be here yet or something.

1238
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,680
Because there's nothing...

1239
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,960
If I go along the edges...

1240
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:54,940
There's...

1241
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,100
Oh!

1242
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,020
Just kidding.

1243
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,420
I think he's going the right way.

1244
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:02,960
Oh, okay.

1245
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,920
Oh, it's a long...

1246
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,460
Oh, there he is.

1247
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,140
I saw him for a tiny second.

1248
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,360
Oh, there he is!

1249
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:13,640
Okay.

1250
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,520
He's running.

1251
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,680
Oh, there he goes.

1252
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,540
He's going.

1253
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,500
Where he's going?

1254
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,340
I don't think we know.

1255
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,230
Rima, thank you so much for the bread.

1256
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,390
La la la la.

1257
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,650
Uh, we just did this really awesome...

1258
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,770
Hall of Mirrors, I think.

1259
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,450
What was that?

1260
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,220
And we're going to the...

1261
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,380
We're playing Blade Runner.

1262
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,200
I forgot to mention.

1263
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,640
Rock for Robin, thank you so much for the...

1264
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,280
Five Crypto-Dwargo.

1265
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,020
Thank you for the five...

1266
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,240
It's a killer, I kid you not.

1267
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,680
Only $35,000.

1268
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:04,300
Thank you.

1269
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,980
Yeah, red, orange, blue, puke green, any color you want.

1270
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,440
Not the puke green.

1271
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,380
Just give me 24 to hose the graffiti off.

1272
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,180
Just kidding.

1273
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,240
Ask for the man.

1274
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,760
Crazy Legs Larry.

1275
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,420
Toodaloo.

1276
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:14,900
Toodaloo.

1277
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,240
Admiring that bishikata, ain't you?

1278
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,680
I don't blame you.

1279
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,280
It's a classic ride in a deluxe sport package.

1280
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:20,680
Thank you.

1281
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,700
It'll push 125 without so much as a shake.

1282
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,680
Of course, you've got to find the road for it.

1283
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,360
125.

1284
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,320
That's always the problem.

1285
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,940
Crazy Legs Larry Hirsch.

1286
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,040
Pleased to meet you.

1287
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,260
Ray McCoy.

1288
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,980
You can call me Crazy.

1289
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,300
You can call me Larry.

1290
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,160
You can even call me Crazy Legs Larry.

1291
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,120
But don't call me if you don't think a hot set of wheels ain't necessary.

1292
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,760
I love Crazy Legs Larry.

1293
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,640
The bishikata is exceptional.

1294
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,780
Mechanical is Pacific Rim flawless, as usual.

1295
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:50,740
Pacific Rim.

1296
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:54,400
But they also saved some of the classic styling of the old GM days.

1297
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,440
Looks like a piece of work.

1298
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,380
Max, happy birthday!

1299
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,480
Forget those fibroplast Filipino heaps everyone's driving around.

1300
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,980
This is real.

1301
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,000
Just feast your eyes on this.

1302
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,040
You see it?

1303
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,500
You see it?

1304
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,280
That's actual chrome, the real stuff.

1305
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,040
They saved a couple hundred sheets of Tijuana chrome from before the war.

1306
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,320
It's completely legal and everything.

1307
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,220
Beautiful, isn't it?

1308
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,900
What happened?

1309
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,200
I don't think I've ever seen it before.

1310
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,800
And you probably won't ever see it again unless you steal this puppy.

1311
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,200
Wow, he's a salesman.

1312
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:24,680
And honestly...

1313
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,140
No.

1314
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,820
Frankly, I gotta tell you, it's got your name written all over it.

1315
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:29,900
Ray McCovey.

1316
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:30,940
McCoy.

1317
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,360
Give or take a couple letters.

1318
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,280
I'll have to think about it.

1319
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,480
Don't think too long or too hard about it, Roy.

1320
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,780
It's liable to be Gonzo by the time you come back.

1321
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:41,740
Gonzo.

1322
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,140
Gotcha.

1323
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,380
Seeing a lot of running and not enough blades.

1324
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,440
I don't even think we have a blade, which is kind of sad.

1325
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:54,120
I'm gonna go peek at your stuff.

1326
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,100
I keep your paws off that, Ray.

1327
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,200
She's like, come on.

1328
00:58:59,220 --> 00:58:59,780
Maybe...

1329
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,200
I'm trying to be a hospital here.

1330
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:03,820
Hospitable.

1331
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,800
Hospitable.

1332
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,640
Not a hospital.

1333
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,560
Hospitable here.

1334
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,580
You can call me crazy.

1335
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,820
You can call me Minky.

1336
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,160
You can call me crazy-legs Minky.

1337
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,380
See if he has anything.

1338
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,140
You sell a black sedan a few days ago?

1339
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,460
Black sedan?

1340
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,380
Hey, I got standards.

1341
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,640
If it ain't sporty, I got no room for it.

1342
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,280
I've seen the registration.

1343
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,900
I know a woman bought it from you.

1344
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,000
Oh, that sedan.

1345
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,360
Hey, look, a sexy blonde wants to pay top dollar for the ugliest car in the place.

1346
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,020
Who am I to say no?

1347
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:37,920
A sexy blonde.

1348
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,780
Did you know who she was?

1349
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,760
No, but I'd like to know her in the biblical sense if you catch what I'm saying.

1350
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,320
Sir?

1351
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,400
Look, Ray, it ain't a crime for me to make a living.

1352
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,540
Yeah, Ezo's blade.

1353
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,500
I hope you get paperwork for all these vehicles.

1354
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,020
Are we kids or what, Ray?

1355
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,420
You're talking to crazy-legs Larry Hirsch here.

1356
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,100
I take that as a yes.

1357
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,100
You can take it any way you want.

1358
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,680
Just don't take it for a test drive in the fourth sector.

1359
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,000
I hope you get paperwork for all these vehicles.

1360
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,540
I think...

1361
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,420
Okay.

1362
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,680
What's upstairs?

1363
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,340
Whoa!

1364
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,570
Wait a second.

1365
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,950
What's this?

1366
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,350
Locked.

1367
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,610
Locked.

1368
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,430
That sucks.

1369
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:25,390
What?

1370
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,530
McCoy is such a hater.

1371
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,350
He hates everything.

1372
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:34,170
Locked.

1373
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:34,850
Locked.

1374
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,360
Okay.

1375
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,460
Is there anything I'm supposed to be seeing here?

1376
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,480
I thought this was, like, some sort of buff, but no.

1377
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,580
Mic Mac, thank you!

1378
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:50,640
Oh, whoa.

1379
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,000
Hey, Ray, how you doing?

1380
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,620
I'm good.

1381
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,520
Just fine, crazy.

1382
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,940
You've been thinking about the caddy, haven't you?

1383
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,800
I don't blame you, she keeps me up at night, too.

1384
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,640
It's fine, crazy.

1385
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:05,180
And I ain't ever even lip-wrestled in the back seat, which is definitely what's in the cards for a stud of your caliber.

1386
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,480
Throw in a babe and maybe you've got a deal.

1387
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,280
Or crazy legs, please!

1388
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,820
That's what, I'll have one over in a jiffy.

1389
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:11,120
No, just kidding.

1390
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,880
Oh, jeez!

1391
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,530
Hold on, I'm gonna... Sorry, I'm consulting the walkthrough again.

1392
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,750
Old obtuse game, please understand.

1393
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,740
Oh, I missed something at the...

1394
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,440
At the hotel, that crime-seam room, apparently.

1395
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,680
Oh, or... I don't think I grabbed it.

1396
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:49,800
Consulting.

1397
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,320
I don't think I grabbed... Hold on.

1398
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,020
Let's see.

1399
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:05,180
Actually, I don't even see the thing that I grabbed in there.

1400
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:06,740
Oh, wait.

1401
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,540
Moolag Bas!

1402
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,960
That guy sure gets around.

1403
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,340
Please issue weapons.

1404
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,360
Staggered by punches.

1405
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,080
Okay.

1406
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:27,940
Is this the blonde lady?

1407
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,080
Clutter registration, China blonde.

1408
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1409
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:34,620
Okay.

1410
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,160
Ease all!

1411
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,040
Oh, my gosh.

1412
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,180
I didn't even realize...

1413
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:41,780
Okay, all?

1414
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,280
None?

1415
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:42,800
What?

1416
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:43,980
Oh, gosh.

1417
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,880
This is so...

1418
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,580
Oh, the UI on this is crazy.

1419
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,420
I just want to see all the stuff that I have.

1420
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,580
All of it.

1421
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:53,280
Moon Bus.

1422
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,400
This is the murder.

1423
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,340
You can call her Freaky.

1424
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,200
You can call her Menky.

1425
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,920
You can even call her Freaky Ghost Menky.

1426
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,480
Freaky Ghost Men.

1427
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,620
Hope you're having a good Tuesday, Men Dole.

1428
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,700
Thank you, my girl.

1429
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,380
I'm having the best that I can have.

1430
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,300
My ribs still hurt, and at least two teeth were loose.

1431
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,980
Sadiq was a tough customer, but he just didn't act like a rep.

1432
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,760
I got in at least one good shot.

1433
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,040
Thank you so much for the pink defeat.

1434
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,660
A Nexus 6 wouldn't have even blinked.

1435
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,740
A little database, mate.

1436
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,380
Oh, here we go.

1437
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:31,860
Cheese!

1438
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,260
Okay, Clovis and Moon Bus.

1439
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,800
Stop, I don't want to hear about his Sebastian DNA.

1440
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,220
What the hell?

1441
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,580
We're just carrying some guy's DNA.

1442
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,540
Oh, this is Gordo.

1443
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,080
Yeah, yeah, the guy with the crazy...

1444
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,680
The crazy outfit.

1445
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,940
Holden's badge.

1446
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,800
Oh, I think this is what we got at the hotel room.

1447
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,260
Hysteria token.

1448
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,700
Do we use this at the arcade?

1449
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,200
Do we use this at the arcade?

1450
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:13,820
Izo's friend.

1451
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:15,780
Moon Bus.

1452
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:17,980
Ragdoll.

1453
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:18,420
Ew!

1454
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,720
I don't like that.

1455
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,720
Staggered by points.

1456
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,320
So I'm going to go back to that hotel real quick.

1457
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,080
Oh yeah, Hysteria Hall.

1458
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,860
So what do we use that for?

1459
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,200
Did you find the hot dog?

1460
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:36,880
I didn't.

1461
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,340
Where was that?

1462
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,340
Bradbury.

1463
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:47,950
Ouchie, my ribs hurt.

1464
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,290
Ouchie, ouch.

1465
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:50,850
Ouchie, ouch.

1466
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,010
Oh wait, wait, this is the creepy building.

1467
01:04:58,490 --> 01:04:58,730
No?

1468
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:04,570
Maybe we kind of look around in it a little bit.

1469
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:06,050
Since I wanted to before.

1470
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:18,850
Yeah?

1471
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,870
Wait, what's in here?

1472
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:26,930
Wait, what's in here?

1473
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,420
The fastest elevator known to man.

1474
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,620
We didn't even go in here.

1475
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,660
I miss so much, what the heck.

1476
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:40,580
Right.

1477
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,920
I don't think I did, at least.

1478
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:02,320
Why are you so loud?

1479
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,140
I was chasing one of the perpetrators.

1480
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,600
Well, everything's alright now.

1481
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,620
I'm pretty sure I can handle it.

1482
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,060
You may think you can, but believe me, you can't.

1483
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,360
Better if I check it out.

1484
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,920
If you insist.

1485
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:20,300
I don't think they took anything.

1486
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,120
I don't really have anything here of any value.

1487
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,200
You work for Tyrell Corporation?

1488
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,280
Yes, sir.

1489
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,040
I'm one of the principal design engineers for Dr. Tyrell.

1490
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,800
He's a very nice man.

1491
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,740
You know, he even fronted me the money to buy this building.

1492
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,640
It's a landmark, you know.

1493
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,200
You really should see the front edifice.

1494
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,420
They put some amazing detail into it.

1495
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,040
You feeling alright?

1496
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,220
Oh, sure.

1497
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,280
I'm fine.

1498
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,720
You wouldn't be hiding anybody, would you?

1499
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:49,800
No, sir.

1500
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,300
There's nobody here but me and my friends.

1501
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:53,920
What friends?

1502
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,640
Evening, general.

1503
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:06,820
See?

1504
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,200
I make friends.

1505
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,400
He almost looks real.

1506
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,540
He's plenty real enough for me.

1507
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,440
And real good company, too.

1508
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,560
Look, I gotta check the premises again.

1509
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,040
Maybe they left something behind.

1510
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:19,780
Thank you.

1511
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,640
Well, if you want to take a look, go on ahead.

1512
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,540
I can't stop you.

1513
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,660
But please be careful in my lab.

1514
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,200
He's got a parrot on him?

1515
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,340
He's got a little...

1516
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,840
It was some kind of freakish toy.

1517
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,760
Half mechanical, half organic.

1518
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,340
Rep technology for sure.

1519
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,180
But no one was going to give me any retirement bonus for it.

1520
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,360
Oh.

1521
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,640
Now, where did we explore?

1522
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,940
I think we went this way.

1523
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,280
So let's look this way.

1524
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:45,860
Oh, no.

1525
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:46,560
No, no.

1526
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,780
We were in this room.

1527
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,260
Oh.

1528
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:48,960
Oh, God.

1529
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:49,600
No.

1530
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,900
We definitely came in here.

1531
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,980
Oh, I remember.

1532
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:52,840
Wait.

1533
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,500
Sorry.

1534
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,680
Oh, this is the...

1535
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:55,840
Okay.

1536
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,500
Maybe we did go through everything then.

1537
01:07:59,260 --> 01:07:59,960
Oh, God.

1538
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,280
They're always following me.

1539
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,480
Gosh.

1540
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,760
They're so creepy.

1541
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,600
I'm not even...

1542
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,080
I'm not even one to be afraid of dolls or anything.

1543
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,960
But...

1544
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,660
Golly.

1545
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,740
Maybe it's because I was so scared of it as a kid.

1546
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,560
Seeing it again is just bringing out all those emotions.

1547
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:25,740
Let's just wait.

1548
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,040
Oh, yeah.

1549
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:29,820
We did see this.

1550
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:31,660
What?

1551
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,760
Surely there's something here, though.

1552
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:34,820
Okay.

1553
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,260
I think I'm just wasting time.

1554
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,480
Creepier than a labubu.

1555
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:44,840
Yeah.

1556
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,740
I guess we saw everything.

1557
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:47,800
What's over this way?

1558
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:49,760
The lab.

1559
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,040
Hmm.

1560
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,720
I guess we did see everything.

1561
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:58,860
Yeah.

1562
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,500
And his running water room.

1563
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:02,080
And then the ladder that we went up.

1564
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,860
And that led to...

1565
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:04,940
This area.

1566
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:06,480
Then...

1567
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,180
That we...

1568
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,360
Yeah.

1569
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,260
Okay.

1570
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,000
We can leave them.

1571
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:13,920
I guess we saw everything.

1572
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,960
I think they're cute.

1573
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,220
What?

1574
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,360
The little walking guys?

1575
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,480
I think usually...

1576
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,180
I would think...

1577
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:20,980
I think...

1578
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,160
I think usually I would.

1579
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,060
But it's just evoking such a...

1580
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:24,540
Wait a second.

1581
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,000
Like an old memory.

1582
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:28,860
For me.

1583
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,520
Never mind.

1584
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,300
Shut up, monkey.

1585
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,300
At least we got to see him.

1586
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,820
Because we did not get to see him before.

1587
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,280
But how do I get to...

1588
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,440
I guess we'll go from...

1589
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:57,900
Uh...

1590
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,080
China...

1591
01:09:59,080 --> 01:09:59,580
Town.

1592
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:06,620
Man.

1593
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,040
Okay.

1594
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:24,500
Take your mask.

1595
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:25,980
And then...

1596
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,550
I was like, what was I doing here again?

1597
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,170
There was something I missed...

1598
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,330
In the...

1599
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,530
In the hotel room.

1600
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:39,070
Apparently.

1601
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:40,330
I guess.

1602
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,940
It said somewhere in the trash can.

1603
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,370
Aha!

1604
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:00,530
That?

1605
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:02,670
Aha!

1606
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,070
It was an animal scale.

1607
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:06,590
Okay, cool.

1608
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,990
Well, why did that not show up for me before?

1609
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,770
I feel like I've combed that whole room.

1610
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:15,850
Blind...

1611
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:16,830
Blind, minky.

1612
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:19,050
Okay.

1613
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,450
I am once again...

1614
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:22,990
Consulting...

1615
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:25,170
The walkthrough.

1616
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,590
Okay, we gotta go back.

1617
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,010
Okay, that's what I thought.

1618
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,470
We have to go back to the arcade.

1619
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,230
I don't know what...

1620
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:43,450
This is...

1621
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:44,970
This is GameFAQs.

1622
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,710
It is a truly...

1623
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,010
A GameFAQs walkthrough moment.

1624
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:52,630
Ah.

1625
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:54,650
Click through.

1626
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,370
We do be clicking.

1627
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,580
Nowadays, kids only have...

1628
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,760
Let's Plays.

1629
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:13,960
Lucy.

1630
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,220
You seen a girl around here?

1631
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,140
About 14.

1632
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,240
With pink hair?

1633
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,880
Maybe in the arcade.

1634
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,300
I was 14 with pink hair once.

1635
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,340
A long time ago.

1636
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,380
Don't think he means you.

1637
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:27,560
Yeah, this isn't about you, Mia.

1638
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:28,240
Of course not.

1639
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,060
Not now.

1640
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,900
We work outside this area hall, don't we?

1641
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:36,060
Well, we must see 20, 30 girls a day with pink hair.

1642
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,840
And every other color in the rainbow.

1643
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,360
I guess hair dye is really cheap.

1644
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,000
You know where I could score some cheese?

1645
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,020
Like this stuff?

1646
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,760
Boy, don't flash that around here.

1647
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,800
He's the police, sweetie.

1648
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,320
Besides, the kids today...

1649
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:57,560
Just as soon Trista might be in your backside as to ask Virginia for the tram home.

1650
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,920
Show that cheese around here.

1651
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,320
You become a marked man.

1652
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:01,720
Why?

1653
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:02,940
Who sells it?

1654
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,580
Now, we aren't asking for any trouble, right?

1655
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,520
I'm not working, Bunko.

1656
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,900
I just want some information.

1657
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,660
Dark nutty board.

1658
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,200
Who runs Kingston Kitchen.

1659
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,940
Kingston Kitchen, you said?

1660
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,040
She's always bragging about her special ingredient.

1661
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,200
That stew she makes.

1662
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,720
It always did taste a little gamey.

1663
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,780
And she charges an arm and light for her, too.

1664
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,740
The logo, yeah.

1665
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,360
I wonder if this one, too.

1666
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,980
So we're going to a kitchen?

1667
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,270
I feel like a real detective in this game.

1668
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,710
Just kidding, we're going nowhere.

1669
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,090
I am once again consulting.

1670
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:08,490
Okay.

1671
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:12,850
Sorry.

1672
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:14,650
Sorry for looking at the walkthrough so much.

1673
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:19,210
I just kind of don't want to, like, just be roaming around everywhere, you know?

1674
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:21,890
Let's see.

1675
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,170
We're going back to...

1676
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,490
Run sitters.

1677
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:32,750
Nope.

1678
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:33,230
Just kidding.

1679
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:34,210
Anemoid Row.

1680
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,940
These games are easy to get stuck, y'all.

1681
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,380
I know.

1682
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,360
They're so fun.

1683
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,420
Oh, I wonder if this lady had...

1684
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,860
I was wondering what this place was again.

1685
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,680
I kind of forgot.

1686
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,160
I wonder if she has any info.

1687
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,300
Run, run, run.

1688
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,520
Running, run.

1689
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:08,680
We gave her.

1690
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,740
Any luck finding more of that dragonfly jewelry?

1691
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,780
Oh, si, si, I was right.

1692
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,140
This you show me was part of the connection.

1693
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,100
Blade Runner, not Blade Rover.

1694
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,880
Bought for nightclub in fourth second.

1695
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:20,220
Ah!

1696
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,020
You know the name of the nightclub owner?

1697
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,580
No, senor.

1698
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,500
But my friend, he says the man is not selfish.

1699
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,200
The nightclub.

1700
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,050
Are we going right there?

1701
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,140
No, we're going in...

1702
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,020
This is...

1703
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:44,300
No.

1704
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:45,140
Hawker?

1705
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,760
This is Hawker, yeah.

1706
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,420
In here.

1707
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:54,430
Oh, yeah.

1708
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,330
We got to ask this lady about the...

1709
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:57,590
We got to ask about the cheese.

1710
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:58,950
Ma'am?

1711
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,370
I've got some cheese.

1712
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,450
Mia and Murray tell me you're using cheese in your stew.

1713
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:04,570
Real cheese.

1714
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:05,330
Real cheese.

1715
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,630
Demo buzzards.

1716
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:07,590
What they know?

1717
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:10,790
I could take a sample of that stew you're cooking back to the lab and have a test...

1718
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:11,930
I forgot this place was called Kingston.

1719
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,650
Why, you pick on Mama Isabella.

1720
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,630
I never do.

1721
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,450
You know her.

1722
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,050
Yeah.

1723
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,010
Where'd you get it?

1724
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:20,470
My sister.

1725
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:21,870
She got connections.

1726
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:23,750
Where can I find her?

1727
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,790
She back in Jamaica, man.

1728
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,530
Far away from here.

1729
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:30,390
She sent me cheese once, maybe twice a month.

1730
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,010
Jamaica's got the cheese.

1731
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,970
Funny thing you asking about the cheese.

1732
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,950
Last week...

1733
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:37,590
Kevin, happy birthday!

1734
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,150
...this ugly little man he run by.

1735
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:42,810
Grab whole box of empty takeout cartons right off the counter.

1736
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:44,110
Not ugly little man.

1737
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:44,690
Police next door.

1738
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:45,950
They just laugh.

1739
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:49,290
Say the guy not be so happy when he opened them cartons.

1740
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:51,990
What's that have to do with the cheese?

1741
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:54,350
Cheese hidden in that box, man.

1742
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,530
Keeping it safe till I cook up a new batch.

1743
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,230
So how could I tell police to bring back box?

1744
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,210
They find cheese, they shut me down.

1745
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,230
Why is cheese illegal?

1746
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,830
This guy who robbed you, what do you look like?

1747
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,910
Shark.

1748
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,190
Little shark.

1749
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,610
Bad clothes.

1750
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,230
Colors way too bright.

1751
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,390
Funny bow tie.

1752
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,170
Oh, what's his name?

1753
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:11,490
Gordo?

1754
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:12,790
Maybe you look for this...

1755
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:12,810
Oh, shoot.

1756
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:13,450
What about that guy's name?

1757
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:13,750
Yeah?

1758
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:17,410
I'm thinking you not really care about the cheese.

1759
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,910
You're right.

1760
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:21,670
But I still think you ought to get yourself a different secret ingredient.

1761
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:23,150
Batman.

1762
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:26,330
That cheese been nothing but trouble for Mama Isabella.

1763
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,270
Gordo!

1764
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:32,870
He's our cheese thief, maybe.

1765
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,010
Maybe, maybe.

1766
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,440
Okay, one second.

1767
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,460
Sorry.

1768
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:08,450
I tried to do this and it didn't let me...

1769
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,270
What the heck?

1770
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,470
What the heck is going on?

1771
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:20,430
Remember how at the police station I was like zooming in on the pictures and I was trying to get the people in the background of the moon bus?

1772
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:21,950
But it wouldn't let me.

1773
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:26,730
But now I'll walk through saying zoom in on the people in the background of the moon bus.

1774
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:31,250
That's what I tried.

1775
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:31,570
That's what I tried.

1776
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,550
Maybe I was sequence breaking.

1777
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,940
We tried doing it after someone tells her to.

1778
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:40,500
No.

1779
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:46,620
A bracing story about the dark and gritty illegal cheese trade of the future.

1780
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,460
Blade Runner versus Cheese Runner.

1781
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,980
Maybe Mama Isabella would say it's not so easy, man.

1782
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,580
All together now.

1783
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,100
It's easy.

1784
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Thank you.

1785
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:02,500
Thank you.

1786
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:15,100
This game's non-linear with progression, maybe.

1787
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,180
I feel like it's...

1788
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,800
I feel like it's been...

1789
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,360
Both.

1790
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,180
Because it's definitely kind of like a...

1791
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,740
You can't do one thing without doing something else kind of situation.

1792
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,600
Let's see if this guy has anything to say.

1793
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:30,640
Hello.

1794
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,060
You keeping busy, pal?

1795
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,760
Nah, the place...

1796
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,760
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1797
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,880
You keeping busy, pal?

1798
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,820
Let's see if that one is...

1799
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,840
Uploading personal clue database.

1800
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,380
Downloading mainframe clue database.

1801
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,700
Clue database transfer complete.

1802
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,280
Why is he so snarky?

1803
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,360
He's just got the cop attitude.

1804
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,320
Okay, moon bus.

1805
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:03,780
Moon bus.

1806
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,820
Moon bus.

1807
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,160
Moon bus.

1808
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,920
Moon bus.

1809
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:15,960
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1810
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:18,720
Wait.

1811
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,840
Didn't I try to do this before?

1812
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,420
Maybe this guy over here?

1813
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,880
You almost got it right.

1814
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,420
You just didn't highlight the shadow at the back right of the quadrant.

1815
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,960
Are you kidding me?

1816
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,800
Is it this one?

1817
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,600
That's damn strange.

1818
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,500
Give me a hard copy of that.

1819
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,120
What is it?

1820
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,340
I can't actually tell.

1821
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,400
Huh?

1822
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,000
It's... Capture.

1823
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,740
Trees detecting.

1824
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:56,980
Sending nukes.

1825
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,360
Isn't that the Jeopardy sound?

1826
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,460
It does sound like it, right?

1827
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:03,080
I'm turning 33 tomorrow.

1828
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:04,940
Could you wish Kenneth a happy birthday?

1829
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:05,860
Kenneth!

1830
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,300
Happy birthday!

1831
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,220
Oh, next to the truck.

1832
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,240
What the hecky?

1833
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,260
This guy where?

1834
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:14,780
This one?

1835
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,900
The one that I said it was a person before?

1836
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,260
Oh!

1837
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:24,180
I... I think I see it.

1838
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,460
Th... No.

1839
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,860
There's no way it's this.

1840
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,930
No, that's just normal shadow.

1841
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:43,550
I thought it was like a person's shadow.

1842
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:47,150
Um...

1843
01:21:59,170 --> 01:21:59,690
Nani?

1844
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,220
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1845
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,220
Am I... dumb?

1846
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,900
What is that on the ground?

1847
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,180
Is that anything?

1848
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,100
Just the ground?

1849
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,700
I think it's just the ground.

1850
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,240
The answer was Cheese.

1851
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:28,980
Who is Cheese?

1852
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,080
Um...

1853
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,340
But zoom in on the guy sitting right there.

1854
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,260
Now zoom in on Sadiq, the guy on the left.

1855
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,260
Yeah.

1856
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,120
Finally, way in the shadows by the moon bus, zoom in on...

1857
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,600
In the shadows of the moon bus?

1858
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,080
Is this...

1859
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,960
Is this not the person we're looking for?

1860
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:55,780
Oh...

1861
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:58,220
You're not gonna be able to answer the Daily Double!

1862
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,000
What?

1863
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,500
It's him?

1864
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,580
Then why isn't it telling me?

1865
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,760
I keep getting the same thing every time.

1866
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,200
Okay, hold on.

1867
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,000
Maybe I...

1868
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,480
It's doing the same thing every time.

1869
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:27,940
Wait!

1870
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,140
Oh!

1871
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,020
Oh!

1872
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,100
It hits!

1873
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,660
That can't be me.

1874
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,040
Give me a hard copy of that.

1875
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:42,830
That can't be me.

1876
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:46,500
It's us!

1877
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,600
That's what they were talking about.

1878
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,460
Family, maybe.

1879
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:55,260
Oh my god.

1880
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,300
Wait, so we know them.

1881
01:23:59,120 --> 01:23:59,920
Okay, hold on.

1882
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:09,230
Okay, we gotta go back to the Tyrell building, it seems.

1883
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,410
I don't know why we're going back to the Tyrell building.

1884
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,370
Oh, I'm hungry!

1885
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:28,890
You don't know why this is gonna happen!

1886
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:34,330
It's...

1887
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,920
That's exactly how it looks when I went.

1888
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,340
You got an appointment this time?

1889
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,220
Nope.

1890
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,580
So why are you here?

1891
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,880
Wait.

1892
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,820
It says we're supposed to have an appointment.

1893
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:08,960
Uh-oh, what did I miss?

1894
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,480
Big boss, deep cover ending.

1895
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,760
What did I miss?

1896
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,300
When am I supposed to get an appointment?

1897
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,960
It's so embarrassing when you forget to make the reservations.

1898
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,860
I like how he's just like, you have an appointment?

1899
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:38,680
Nope.

1900
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:46,560
What?

1901
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,640
Pull my gun?

1902
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:48,560
Let's see what happens.

1903
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,440
Hey, I said I don't have an appointment.

1904
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,420
Just unload.

1905
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,960
Let's go through everything, I guess.

1906
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:17,280
What?

1907
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,600
Uh-oh.

1908
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,440
Sorry, guys.

1909
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:25,100
I'm screw... I'm a screw-up.

1910
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,920
Let me talk to them.

1911
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:29,620
See if I would...

1912
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,500
So, anyone else explode around here lately?

1913
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,520
I eat any more of that cafeteria food my stomach's liable to.

1914
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,720
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, sir.

1915
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,420
You're gonna throw me out?

1916
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:40,780
If need be.

1917
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,140
Oh.

1918
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,120
What?

1919
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,940
I didn't... I didn't talk or anything.

1920
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:47,920
Huh?

1921
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:51,260
How am I supposed to have an appointment?

1922
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:52,800
Hmm.

1923
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,020
Hmm.

1924
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:02,430
Interesting.

1925
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,030
You can pull out your gun anywhere except the strip club.

1926
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,670
They got morals there.

1927
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:07,430
Hahaha.

1928
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,380
Did not know this game existed.

1929
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,020
It's actually quite fun.

1930
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,320
But, you know...

1931
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,920
...games of this era are quite obtuse as well.

1932
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:23,400
Hahaha.

1933
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:26,840
How?

1934
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:31,780
Okay, hold on.

1935
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,200
McCoy didn't ask security on how to meet Dr. Tyrell.

1936
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,520
He won't be able to ask Guzza in requesting an appointment.

1937
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,120
Let me go ask Guzza.

1938
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,780
Yeah, let's go back to the police station, maybe.

1939
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,340
Mr. Mr. Bossman.

1940
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:53,780
Please.

1941
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:59,760
I still can't get over how good this game looks for $19.97.

1942
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,400
It looks so good.

1943
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:04,320
Lock up.

1944
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,860
This is our man, right?

1945
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:11,800
No!

1946
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,920
He's too busy just wandering everywhere.

1947
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,500
This guy!

1948
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,500
Help, please!

1949
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:33,460
Ah...

1950
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,000
Okay, hold on.

1951
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:41,150
Maybe he's wandering around the police station, too.

1952
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:45,290
Maybe we'll just see him come around the corner.

1953
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,410
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1954
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:51,890
Now I'm actually stuck.

1955
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:52,570
Because the...

1956
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:55,410
The...

1957
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,610
The guide.

1958
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:00,850
I'm only, like, skimming the guide, so...

1959
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:02,890
I probably do miss things, too.

1960
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:04,970
But...

1961
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:26,670
I missed something.

1962
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:28,190
It seems.

1963
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:29,110
I missed something else.

1964
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:29,870
Oh, there he is!

1965
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:30,910
Hey.

1966
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:32,590
Tough day, McCoy.

1967
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:34,690
Oh, come on.

1968
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:34,930
Hey.

1969
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:35,590
Hey.

1970
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,550
You killed anyone yet?

1971
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,410
Hey.

1972
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:38,350
This guy sucks.

1973
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,990
Ah, this guy sucks.

1974
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:43,370
Okay.

1975
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,790
Well, then we go to the roof.

1976
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,950
Okay, I gotta go back...

1977
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,660
...to that dang hotel again.

1978
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,700
I missed so much there.

1979
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,320
Did I kill anyone?

1980
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:03,680
Did I kill anyone?

1981
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,340
I don't think I did.

1982
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,240
Oops, sorry.

1983
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:09,120
I just...

1984
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:09,920
Bonked my mic.

1985
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,040
Not yet.

1986
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,240
There will be...

1987
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,920
Shed!

1988
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:19,920
Shed!

1989
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Okay, this is...

1990
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,720
Do you see that?

1991
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,520
Right there?

1992
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:23,940
That's what I...

1993
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,760
Freaking missed.

1994
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:29,960
Agh!

1995
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,900
The wrapper was from a vendor I knew.

1996
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,960
Best lycan dogs in the fourth sector.

1997
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,420
That wasn't saying a whole lot.

1998
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:39,580
But with an arcade next door and a dozen nightclubs down the street...

1999
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:44,180
Mia and Murray's stand saw more action in a night than my spinster aunt saw all last century.

2000
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:44,660
Damn.

2001
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,100
Not the spinster.

2002
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,500
Wow, I know, right?

2003
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,560
Holy cow.

2004
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,020
Here I was, praising.

2005
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,260
I was just like, It's so easy to see the things you need to click.

2006
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,140
Hahaha.

2007
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:04,940
Last stream I was just like, Dang, everything's outlined.

2008
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,620
Back to...

2009
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,920
Back to...

2010
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:13,960
Hysteria Hall.

2011
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,880
Oh my gosh, I just noticed the crazy legs.

2012
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:32,780
Hahaha.

2013
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:37,040
He's so committed to the bed.

2014
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:37,740
I found this wrapper.

2015
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,720
Yeah, that's from one of our dogs.

2016
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,560
I found this wrapper.

2017
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,860
No way, that's all you have to say about it.

2018
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,280
Hahaha.

2019
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,720
Be good, you two.

2020
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:06,210
Huuuuh.

2021
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:09,470
Back to the...

2022
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:11,710
Back to the guidebook.

2023
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,030
Hahaha.

2024
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:21,050
Oh, yeah, that cracked the case, everybody.

2025
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:23,010
Golly.

2026
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:29,410
Ah, cereal hall.

2027
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:31,610
I don't know about...

2028
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:31,910
Uh-oh.

2029
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,810
Crazy Legs... Let's try it.

2030
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:36,850
Let's try Larry again.

2031
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:39,470
Crazy Legs.

2032
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,960
Keep your paws off that, Ray.

2033
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:53,980
Sorry.

2034
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,540
I hope you get paperwork for all these vehicles.

2035
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,080
Are we kids or what, Ray?

2036
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,380
You're talking to Crazy Legs Larry Hirsch here.

2037
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:02,780
Oh, okay.

2038
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,160
I take that as a yes.

2039
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,140
You can take it any way you want.

2040
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:06,500
Just...

2041
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,000
Okay, we heard this.

2042
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,480
All right, thank you.

2043
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,040
Thank you so much, Strike, for helping.

2044
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,270
Thank you!

2045
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:19,210
Okay, let's hope that she's here now.

2046
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:22,750
Maybe in here?

2047
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:26,130
Do I have to chase her through the hall of mirrors?

2048
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,010
I sure hope not.

2049
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:31,150
I don't see her here!

2050
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:31,870
No!

2051
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:36,370
Gosh, why does this game hate me?

2052
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,650
She's not in the hall of mirrors, is she?

2053
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,130
Nobody's in here!

2054
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:45,970
This room sucks!

2055
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:46,490
No!

2056
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:47,530
Oh, no!

2057
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:50,570
Once you're in, you have to go through the whole thing!

2058
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:51,590
Oh, my God.

2059
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:52,990
Oh, my God!

2060
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,320
Oh,

2061
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:19,920
my God!

2062
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,720
The BPM of the song is doubled!

2063
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,340
Oh, my God!

2064
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,860
I can't keep up!

2065
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,040
Mysterious!

2066
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:41,660
This...

2067
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:49,700
Ah...

2068
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,520
Wait...

2069
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,200
I missed some...

2070
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,780
Okay, there was something I...

2071
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:57,240
Missed at the animoid row.

2072
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:00,680
I remember going there, or...

2073
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,640
I think I was supposed to go there and I did not go there.

2074
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,640
Because I was silly...

2075
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,180
Okay...

2076
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,460
Sorry, I completely...

2077
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:10,160
Missed a part of what I was supposed to do, because I...

2078
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,600
Thought I had done it, and I didn't.

2079
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,840
And I'm like, rah-rah.

2080
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,280
You ever sit back and wonder who is...

2081
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,800
Who in the universe of these games is building this type of stuff?

2082
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,140
Well, that's like a...

2083
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,820
Oh, okay, here it says...

2084
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:32,800
Wait, okay, so we did come here, but what was it?

2085
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,920
The woman running the fish place.

2086
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,000
But she's not here.

2087
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:40,880
Nobody's here.

2088
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,060
This... because we have to talk to her about the scale.

2089
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:48,960
Oh, here she is!

2090
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:49,360
Ah!

2091
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,140
Go back, go back, go back!

2092
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,020
Go back, go back, go back!

2093
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:51,760
Go back, please.

2094
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,860
Is this scale from a fish?

2095
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:53,360
There we go!

2096
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,700
Same as other one.

2097
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:55,980
Not fish.

2098
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,480
Snake scale.

2099
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:58,860
What other one?

2100
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,660
Other police show me scale from same snake.

2101
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,780
I send him to Abdul Hassan.

2102
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,600
How could you tell I was police?

2103
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,300
Both of you walking around look confused.

2104
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,080
Like you in wrong place.

2105
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,840
The scale is the thing that I forgot.

2106
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:15,340
It was in the bathroom of the, uh...

2107
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:17,760
I think that's the guy with the snakes.

2108
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,100
It was in the bathroom of the hotel.

2109
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:20,380
Okay, progress!

2110
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:22,620
Progress, baby.

2111
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:37,410
Is that all I was supposed to do?

2112
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,510
We don't talk to the guy...

2113
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,910
There was a guy here with a snake, no?

2114
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:41,430
Before?

2115
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:43,990
Curious.

2116
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:53,740
Why...

2117
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:56,240
Why do I feel like I'm so...

2118
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:56,660
...bleh...

2119
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,560
...today with...

2120
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,700
...figuring out this game?

2121
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,400
Okay, but it's saying to go...

2122
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,760
Maybe it unlocks the next point so Lucy shows up.

2123
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,080
I'll try, but...

2124
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,620
...it's not telling me to...

2125
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,960
...see Lucy yet.

2126
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:31,700
Let's check.

2127
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:42,330
The woman said McCoy looked confused, so it's lore accurate.

2128
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:43,650
Absolutely.

2129
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:49,530
Lucy!

2130
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:50,910
Lucy!

2131
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:54,170
Lucy, I'm...

2132
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:54,810
Oh!

2133
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:56,110
There she is!

2134
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:56,830
Oh my gosh!

2135
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:58,070
Lucy!

2136
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:59,290
I've been looking for you.

2137
01:37:59,510 --> 01:37:59,870
Yeah!

2138
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:01,090
Please, leave me alone.

2139
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:02,570
No, no, please, Lucy.

2140
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:03,210
Father told me to watch out for you.

2141
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,510
You don't know what I've been through to see you.

2142
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:04,790
I'm not gonna hurt you.

2143
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:06,630
Have you always lived on Tara?

2144
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:07,570
Yes.

2145
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:10,290
Father told me he thought Tara would be...

2146
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:12,550
...so special and beautiful.

2147
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:14,470
Birds and flowers and trees...

2148
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:15,250
You're like Papa!

2149
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:16,470
...and blue water.

2150
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:18,390
But it's not like that at all.

2151
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:21,030
I don't remember it ever being like that.

2152
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:25,790
Oh wow, we've got a lot to ask her, okay.

2153
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:26,310
Come with me.

2154
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:27,790
I've got a test I want you to take.

2155
01:38:28,630 --> 01:38:29,190
No!

2156
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:29,870
Oh my god.

2157
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:30,890
No!

2158
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:31,610
Please!

2159
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:33,150
Go after her!

2160
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:34,030
Holy shit!

2161
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,180
I forgot that was the test.

2162
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,100
Okay, she'll be back.

2163
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:47,680
She'll be back.

2164
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:53,450
She'll be playing the game again.

2165
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:54,510
Surely.

2166
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:02,050
Okay, I didn't even know this was an exit.

2167
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:09,630
No urgency at all.

2168
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,970
Where the hell did she go?

2169
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:16,530
Did you see a girl come through here?

2170
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,750
Please say yes!

2171
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:19,330
Please!

2172
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:20,190
Crazy!

2173
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,050
Oh my god.

2174
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:26,290
Oh my god.

2175
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:29,730
Lucy, don't you want to play your video games?

2176
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:34,710
What did you just say?

2177
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:35,930
What did you just say?

2178
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,810
Chat, why does Minky look adorable?

2179
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:41,170
What are you talking about?

2180
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:45,560
Oh.

2181
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,540
The maze?

2182
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,040
I don't think she's in there.

2183
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,740
I don't know.

2184
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:57,240
She ran the other way.

2185
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:02,780
I'll look.

2186
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,640
But we're gonna have to run through the whole thing again.

2187
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,300
Like a mouse to cheese.

2188
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:26,540
It's one of those tests that they give the rats.

2189
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,500
To find the cheese.

2190
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:28,880
Yes.

2191
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,920
We had so many things to ask her and she ran away.

2192
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,380
As soon as we were like...

2193
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,140
Come with me.

2194
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,540
Gosh, McCoy.

2195
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:40,280
Don't you have any grace or anything?

2196
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,680
He has no social skill.

2197
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:48,660
Nazrin.

2198
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:56,620
Maybe...

2199
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,380
Maybe running through that resets it.

2200
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:58,900
Let's see.

2201
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:02,000
Maybe that's our torture.

2202
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,080
Oh, she's...

2203
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:05,940
She's gone!

2204
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:12,020
She's gone!

2205
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:13,620
I can't believe she's gone!

2206
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,040
I can't believe I blew it!

2207
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,820
I can't believe I went through so much.

2208
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:18,300
Wait, maybe we'll ask them.

2209
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:19,040
Did you see a girl?

2210
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,560
Be good, you two.

2211
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,960
We're so stupid.

2212
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:46,950
What do you mean we?

2213
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:48,370
Yes, we!

2214
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:49,370
We're all...

2215
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,010
You're...

2216
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:51,830
We're all together in this.

2217
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,250
Let me put that negative resets.

2218
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,850
I forgot what that thing was.

2219
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:56,650
That it was the test.

2220
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:02,850
I

2221
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:08,550
have my appointment today for sure.

2222
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:12,190
Hello.

2223
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,510
Appointment.

2224
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:15,130
I'm a very busy man.

2225
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:16,590
Oh my god.

2226
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:20,850
Okay, you know what I think we should do?

2227
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,590
I think we should go home and sleep.

2228
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,130
I think we should just go home and take a nap.

2229
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:31,850
I think that will solve all our problems.

2230
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:36,730
I'm gonna tuck you guys in.

2231
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,380
I'm tucking you in.

2232
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,820
I'm tucking you in.

2233
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:51,160
I'm tucking you in.

2234
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:51,800
I'm gonna tuck you.

2235
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,120
I'm gonna put in the...

2236
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:54,920
I'm gonna...

2237
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,340
On the sides, you know, when you push in the blanket.

2238
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,680
I'm gonna do that.

2239
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,120
So you can't move.

2240
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,040
I'm gonna give you...

2241
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:02,820
Mackie, stop!

2242
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,020
You're gonna wake the baby!

2243
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,160
Then I'm gonna give you...

2244
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,020
A little kiss on the forehead.

2245
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:09,980
Mwah!

2246
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:12,940
And then...

2247
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,300
I'm gonna play Slipknot.

2248
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:15,300
Wack!

2249
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,740
Okay, nap time!

2250
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,140
Portrait of the sleep deprived.

2251
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,780
That's disturbed.

2252
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,360
Oh, you're so right.

2253
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,480
Sorry.

2254
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,360
I never claimed to be a fan.

2255
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,860
Your floor number, please.

2256
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:49,400
Oof.

2257
01:43:58,760 --> 01:43:59,180
Okay.

2258
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,440
I feel like...

2259
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,780
Sleeping to heavy metal would be like...

2260
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:07,720
Sleeping to white noise, no?

2261
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:10,940
I don't see it as any different.

2262
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,510
But when I can't sleep...

2263
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:12,570
Sleep?

2264
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:15,970
I can only sleep to, uh...

2265
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,050
Like, people talking.

2266
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:20,830
Cause if I...

2267
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:21,790
Sleep...

2268
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:24,810
If I leave myself with my own thoughts, I won't be able to sleep.

2269
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,730
So I have to have someone talking...

2270
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:29,850
So that I don't listen to myself.

2271
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:37,540
Oh my gosh, it's really gone!

2272
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,940
When did I last save?

2273
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:49,470
Okay, but I think this was a while ago.

2274
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:55,030
I think we've done many things since this...

2275
01:44:58,830 --> 01:44:59,710
Guys, I'm...

2276
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,390
I'm like legitimately lost right now.

2277
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:04,350
Because...

2278
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:06,330
Let me tell you what the walkthrough tells me to do.

2279
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:07,390
Act 3.

2280
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:08,610
We start at the hotel.

2281
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:11,770
And then we go to the lobby in the crime scene.

2282
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,670
Then we go to...

2283
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:14,730
Um...

2284
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:15,930
Hysteria Hall here.

2285
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,670
Then we ask about the...

2286
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:19,850
We talk to the old people.

2287
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:21,570
Then we go to the used car shop.

2288
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:24,290
Then we go to the animoid row.

2289
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:26,110
And we talk about...

2290
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:27,410
The...

2291
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:28,370
The...

2292
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:32,090
The fish?

2293
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:33,490
The fish?

2294
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:34,910
Oh, actually...

2295
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:37,910
I wonder if the fish needs to be in the system.

2296
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:40,490
Maybe.

2297
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,890
Then we talk to cheat...

2298
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:43,090
To...

2299
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:45,510
To the lady at the restaurant about the cheese.

2300
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,110
Then we go to the police station.

2301
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:51,670
And then we go to Tyrell headquarters.

2302
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:52,590
That's what...

2303
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,030
The...

2304
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:54,590
The guide is telling me.

2305
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:56,170
So that's why I'm so confused!

2306
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:00,130
That's why I'm so confused!

2307
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:02,410
Baby car, thank you for the gift.

2308
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:03,130
Thank you!

2309
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:06,930
So that's why...

2310
01:46:06,930 --> 01:46:08,430
It's very confusing for me.

2311
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:13,390
Hmm...

2312
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:14,070
Unless...

2313
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:15,590
Maybe this tutorial is wrong?

2314
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:16,410
I don't know...

2315
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,550
Let's go back...

2316
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:22,710
And...

2317
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:23,610
Um...

2318
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:25,890
I think we have different guides.

2319
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:26,710
Oh, do we?

2320
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:27,610
Maybe...

2321
01:46:29,010 --> 01:46:30,590
We should go to the other club.

2322
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:32,190
The...

2323
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,110
The strip club?

2324
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:35,850
Mainframe...

2325
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:36,570
And shooting range.

2326
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:37,670
Mainframe...

2327
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:38,670
And shooting range.

2328
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,130
I like the way she says that.

2329
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:42,350
Uploading...

2330
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:43,690
Personal clue database.

2331
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:47,870
Downloading...

2332
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,230
Mainframe clue database.

2333
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:52,090
Maybe we needed to...

2334
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:53,250
Upload stuff about the fish.

2335
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:54,610
Clue database transfer complete.

2336
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:57,970
Try talking to the lab guy.

2337
01:46:58,190 --> 01:46:58,650
Yeah, that's true.

2338
01:46:58,910 --> 01:46:59,590
Let's try talking to him.

2339
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:06,410
He was floor...

2340
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:13,700
Nope.

2341
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,900
He's not even here!

2342
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:15,820
What a slacker.

2343
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,100
Will you be coming to Animethon?

2344
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:20,880
Asakasa?

2345
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,660
Will be there?

2346
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:23,680
Asakasa?

2347
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,000
Asaka?

2348
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,140
Unfortunately, no!

2349
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:32,020
I won't be, but...

2350
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:33,380
Have fun!

2351
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,400
Her...

2352
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,220
Shows are so much fun.

2353
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:38,780
I've seen her a couple times live now.

2354
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:56,200
You know what?

2355
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:57,300
Let's just go to the strip club.

2356
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,540
When in doubt...

2357
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,340
Go to the strip club.

2358
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:06,140
Get your guns out.

2359
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:07,480
Go, go, go!

2360
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:07,500
Woo!

2361
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:12,620
They won't kick me out if I run in with my gun.

2362
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:17,940
See?

2363
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:18,880
It worked.

2364
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,000
Maybe we can go in here now.

2365
01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:27,310
Sod off, McCoy.

2366
01:48:27,730 --> 01:48:29,110
I've got no time for you.

2367
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:30,010
I don't...

2368
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:31,010
I lost!

2369
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,150
Please, sir!

2370
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:34,650
Early's waiting on me.

2371
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:36,070
Sod off!

2372
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:39,550
You've got no appointment, and you've got no warrant.

2373
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:41,690
Wait, but I know his name!

2374
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:42,630
Lady?

2375
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:44,970
Not the talkative type.

2376
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,010
Not the talkative type.

2377
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:48,730
Please!

2378
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:51,150
Haven't I seen you around here before?

2379
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:52,730
That's such a creepy line.

2380
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:53,430
Don't say that.

2381
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,790
I'm a VIP!

2382
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,300
I am a VIP!

2383
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,600
Wait, how did I get in here?

2384
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,100
Ah!

2385
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,340
Uh-oh.

2386
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:11,410
How did I get in here?

2387
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:12,670
Wait.

2388
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:16,450
Whoa, she just did...

2389
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:18,970
Do the wave!

2390
01:49:19,550 --> 01:49:20,670
Whoa, what are you...

2391
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:21,130
Whoa!

2392
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:23,430
Oh my god!

2393
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:25,530
She's so flexible!

2394
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:30,130
Is this doing it for you guys?

2395
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,210
I can't...

2396
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:38,870
Wait, is she the blonde lady that we're needing to talk to?

2397
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:48,190
This is such a dance.

2398
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:53,870
Yeah, throw your ones, everybody!

2399
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,610
Wiggly arms must be...

2400
01:49:57,610 --> 01:50:01,270
I like how the arms are just up when she's in like, waiting mode.

2401
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:03,430
I can't get over them!

2402
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:03,490
I can't get over them!

2403
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,810
Ha ha ha ha!

2404
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:08,750
Woo!

2405
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:09,350
Woo!

2406
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:12,970
Oh my gosh!

2407
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,210
Ha ha ha ha!

2408
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:17,510
Getting ideas for your next 3D?

2409
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:18,770
No.

2410
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,520
How low can you go?

2411
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,640
How low can you go?

2412
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:31,280
How low can you go?

2413
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,780
That's a good time.

2414
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:35,920
That's a good time.

2415
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,460
What's your name?

2416
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:39,420
What's your name?

2417
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,420
What's your name?

2418
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:41,960
What's your name?

2419
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,120
Why are we such a creep?

2420
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,280
Oh, here we go.

2421
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,200
What's your pleasure, sir?

2422
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:51,940
The highest octane.

2423
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,880
One Venus high trap.

2424
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:54,480
Coming up!

2425
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:57,500
Thank you!

2426
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:58,920
What's the green?

2427
01:50:59,160 --> 01:50:59,900
What's the green?

2428
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:00,520
Neptune's nip.

2429
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,940
I think you'll enjoy it, sir.

2430
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:03,140
Neptune's...

2431
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:11,830
I like my woman dancing on 5th PS.

2432
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:13,010
Hit me again.

2433
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:14,270
You pick the color.

2434
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:16,570
Ah, 2 at 10, 10 at 2.

2435
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:18,050
Why is it called that?

2436
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:20,790
Let's just say, it's a love potion.

2437
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:22,610
Ooh la la!

2438
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:23,970
Hit me again.

2439
01:51:24,230 --> 01:51:25,270
You pick the color.

2440
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:26,890
Ah, 2 at 10?

2441
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:27,330
Okay.

2442
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:29,390
Uh...

2443
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:30,790
What am I supposed to do here?

2444
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:34,690
I made it into the VIP room and I have no idea why.

2445
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:42,550
Can I talk to her?

2446
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:43,210
What's your name?

2447
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:45,410
Why are we so weird?

2448
01:51:46,450 --> 01:51:47,410
Wait, can we...

2449
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,090
Oh shit!

2450
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:49,110
We're on the floor!

2451
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:51,750
Do a dance McCoy!

2452
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:56,450
Wait, can I also get on the floor?

2453
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:34,630
Oh, I gotta put my arms up.

2454
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,520
And then put them down.

2455
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,360
Did I do anything for you guys?

2456
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:01,280
I'm sorry.

2457
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,260
I'm here to please.

2458
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:11,800
Oh my gosh.

2459
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:11,960
Oh my gosh.

2460
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:12,600
Oh my gosh.

2461
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,660
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

2462
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:17,260
Um...

2463
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,800
Oh, this is so sad.

2464
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:20,540
Wait.

2465
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,400
Is there something over here?

2466
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:22,820
No.

2467
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,180
What are we supposed to do?

2468
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:25,600
Oh.

2469
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:52,400
Wait, what?

2470
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,020
I didn't take my gun out at all!

2471
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:55,660
Mister!

2472
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:02,320
Blade Runner is a time capsule of the past future.

2473
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:05,180
What was sexy in 2019?

2474
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:08,780
Dancing Ghost.

2475
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:09,400
What's there?

2476
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:11,540
There's another...

2477
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:13,200
There's another nightclub!

2478
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:14,500
Oh my gosh.

2479
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:16,940
I

2480
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:26,000
got so distracted by the betta fish ladies.

2481
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,020
Oh no way!

2482
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,220
There's Gordo!

2483
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:34,620
Hey man.

2484
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,500
You're that cat from Howie Lee's.

2485
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:38,820
McCoy, right?

2486
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,320
We keep bumping into each other.

2487
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,600
You want an autograph?

2488
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,580
I know you ain't heard of me yet.

2489
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:48,460
But Gordo Frizz's autograph's gonna be worth a pile of chin-yan someday.

2490
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:48,900
Relax.

2491
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:50,180
I'll hold my breath.

2492
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,160
I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

2493
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:57,500
Man, don't you got anything better to do than hassle innocent people at their place of work?

2494
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,160
Make it snappy, okay?

2495
01:54:59,460 --> 01:55:01,320
You're like the most awkward stripper ever?

2496
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:02,040
I really appreciate your patience.

2497
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:02,380
Sorry.

2498
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:04,200
Okay.

2499
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,100
The cheese!

2500
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:08,100
Okay, well how's the cheese last since that's the most sensitive information?

2501
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:09,440
You know the chef at Howie's?

2502
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,400
That big flabby guy?

2503
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,140
Never seen him before.

2504
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,560
You were hanging around right when he took off.

2505
01:55:16,060 --> 01:55:16,940
Pure coincidence.

2506
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,700
You are one hell of a suspicious cat, Nikoi.

2507
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:22,160
Kick back.

2508
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:22,820
Relax.

2509
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,280
Watch my show.

2510
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:27,140
Take a little break from your boring existence.

2511
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,800
Oh, is he also gonna get on the stage?

2512
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:31,400
Wait, I kinda... wait, what else is...

2513
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,200
Uh-oh.

2514
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:34,840
Wait.

2515
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,320
No, no, no, I'm not done with you.

2516
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:36,940
Oh, gosh.

2517
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:37,940
Uh-oh.

2518
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:39,420
Uh...

2519
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:40,880
You might wanna blur the poster.

2520
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,400
Oh, I think it's okay.

2521
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,200
It's okay, sweetie.

2522
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,520
Hey, is everybody having a good time tonight?

2523
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:46,840
Thank you, though.

2524
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:47,520
Yeah!

2525
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:48,180
Woo!

2526
01:55:51,130 --> 01:55:51,550
Uh-huh.

2527
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:53,690
What does a marriage and a tornado have in common?

2528
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:57,190
First, there's a lot of sucking and blowing, and then you lose your house.

2529
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:00,570
You know what my first wife's nickname was?

2530
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:01,630
Twister.

2531
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,570
The doctor calls up his patient.

2532
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:07,090
I got bad news, and I got worse news.

2533
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:10,710
The bad news is, he only got 24 hours to live.

2534
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:13,650
The patient says, what could be worse than that?

2535
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:17,290
The doctor says, I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.

2536
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:21,750
Guess what happens to a rep who does his job really well?

2537
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:23,570
Early retirement, baby.

2538
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:26,130
I see we got a celebrity in the audience.

2539
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:28,030
Can I get a spot, please?

2540
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:29,490
That's right.

2541
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:32,550
It's one of the boys from the local Blade Runner unit.

2542
01:56:33,010 --> 01:56:36,990
One of the LPD's finest, Ray McCoy.

2543
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:40,810
Let's give a big hand for Rep Detect McCoy.

2544
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:44,390
He's protecting us poor slobs, ladies and gentlemen.

2545
01:56:44,710 --> 01:56:46,990
He even thinks you're a replicant.

2546
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:49,510
He can waste you right where you stand.

2547
01:56:50,250 --> 01:56:52,810
Nice job, eh, detective?

2548
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:55,630
It doesn't quite work that way.

2549
01:56:56,170 --> 01:56:57,830
How about yourself?

2550
01:56:58,330 --> 01:56:59,910
You sure about yourself?

2551
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:03,170
Cause I got some friends, they say they know you.

2552
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:04,270
You're lying.

2553
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:05,480
Oh!

2554
01:57:07,130 --> 01:57:07,950
Uh-oh.

2555
01:57:08,490 --> 01:57:08,670
Uh-oh.

2556
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:10,110
I think we're on pursuit.

2557
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:12,030
Uh...

2558
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:12,730
Can I go?

2559
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,190
Hello?

2560
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:19,090
Someone's calling me?

2561
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:21,670
Damn.

2562
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:23,930
Why does everyone run?

2563
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:24,670
Hello?

2564
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:26,630
Can I look at the poster?

2565
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:27,510
No?

2566
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,380
I only got to ask him one thing.

2567
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,870
I kind of like his comedy.

2568
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:44,150
He's kind of obsessed with like, twisters and...

2569
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:47,630
Okay.

2570
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:51,270
Everybody hates us.

2571
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:51,990
Oh, there he is.

2572
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:52,690
Hey!

2573
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:53,510
Woo!

2574
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:55,470
Are you shooting at me?

2575
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:57,290
Hey, you can't do that.

2576
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:00,650
They're gonna kick you out of there if you bring your gun out.

2577
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:04,970
I have more questions for you, Gordo!

2578
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:07,010
He's probably in here.

2579
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:09,070
I imagine.

2580
01:58:10,970 --> 01:58:13,950
Why do I keep getting kicked out of the strip club?

2581
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:15,850
You suck!

2582
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:17,810
Please!

2583
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:19,390
Please!

2584
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,300
Early's waiting on me.

2585
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,740
Sod off!

2586
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:37,280
You've got no appointment, and you've got no warrant.

2587
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,250
Please let me in!

2588
01:58:43,970 --> 01:58:44,930
Won't let me in!

2589
01:58:46,430 --> 01:58:47,310
What the?!

2590
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:49,090
Let him turn his back?

2591
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,730
Oh, okay.

2592
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:55,190
Is that how I snuck in before, I guess?

2593
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:57,990
I feel like his back has been turned!

2594
01:58:58,650 --> 01:58:59,610
Let me try here.

2595
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:01,090
Oh, he looks at me.

2596
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:02,450
Okay, let me...

2597
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:05,030
Oh, shoot.

2598
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,590
Okay.

2599
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:07,430
Ow!

2600
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:10,930
Dang it!

2601
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:13,070
He's fast.

2602
01:59:13,770 --> 01:59:14,810
I'm faster.

2603
01:59:16,430 --> 01:59:17,050
No!

2604
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:18,310
I'm not faster.

2605
01:59:19,670 --> 01:59:20,390
You

2606
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:30,740
know why they kick you out?

2607
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:32,020
You're too freaky for the club.

2608
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:36,700
Here we go.

2609
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,380
Nice and easy.

2610
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,580
Ow!

2611
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,740
Turn away, mister.

2612
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:54,200
I'm not a bother to you.

2613
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:55,200
There we go.

2614
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:02,820
Big ham!

2615
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:03,940
Thank you!

2616
02:00:06,150 --> 02:00:07,030
Thank you!

2617
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:10,310
Oh my gosh, he's not going to turn around, is he?

2618
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,100
Go, go.

2619
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:29,810
Hint is girl on stage?

2620
02:00:30,030 --> 02:00:30,950
Okay, let's go talk to her.

2621
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:36,370
Let me tell you what I want, and maybe I'll impress you.

2622
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,720
Is he gonna go watch her?

2623
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:50,300
Okay.

2624
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:56,290
Yes, sir!

2625
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:01,190
Nice distraction, ma'am.

2626
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:02,770
There he is!

2627
02:01:05,790 --> 02:01:06,190
Gordo!

2628
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:08,570
You shot at me.

2629
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:13,260
Okay, they don't kick me out.

2630
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:14,760
Can you imagine?

2631
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:17,300
He's trying to pretend to be a bartender.

2632
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:19,940
Oh, that's early!

2633
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:20,600
Who are you?

2634
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,760
Your man gave me a hard time out there.

2635
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,540
Wait, okay.

2636
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:25,360
I like Hanoi, but I can't deny...

2637
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,140
I thought you were Gordo.

2638
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:28,320
What's on tap tonight?

2639
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,480
Classy shows all evening, General.

2640
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:32,080
You're gonna be able to cut diamonds down there.

2641
02:01:32,180 --> 02:01:32,800
Oh, you're money back.

2642
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:33,360
Ooh.

2643
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:35,920
Okay, but where's our guy?

2644
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,860
You buy some jewelry at an auction recently?

2645
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:39,520
Real old, elite stuff.

2646
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:40,840
Who's asking?

2647
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:41,840
Me!

2648
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:42,840
You ain't with robbery homicide.

2649
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,840
You ain't with robbery homicide.

2650
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,400
Those pieces ain't hot.

2651
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:47,780
I got the papers to prove it.

2652
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:50,080
I picked them up at legitimate auction.

2653
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:51,540
Cost me nearly a pound of flesh, too.

2654
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:54,120
You give this stuff to a girlfriend early?

2655
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,320
No kidding?

2656
02:01:55,720 --> 02:01:56,860
I ain't that stupid.

2657
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:57,480
No, no, no, no.

2658
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:00,720
I was letting one of my dancers use this stuff in her act.

2659
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:03,140
Kind of a tribute to the ancient Swamp Man.

2660
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:03,640
You know what I mean?

2661
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,180
Ah.

2662
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:05,060
Which dancer?

2663
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:06,600
Heck you, huh?

2664
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:08,020
She's gone, huh?

2665
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,300
Heck you, boss.

2666
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:11,680
She's one of my biggest earners, too.

2667
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:12,900
She ain't in any trouble now, is she?

2668
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:13,460
Hmm.

2669
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:14,240
Not yet.

2670
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:15,540
Good.

2671
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:16,160
Good.

2672
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:18,420
Wouldn't want to slaughter the goose that lays in the golden age.

2673
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:18,940
The ceiling!

2674
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:20,860
Oh my god!

2675
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:22,500
Oh my god!

2676
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:22,640
Oh my god!

2677
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:25,260
It's just so...

2678
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:26,660
Okay, they're not naked, though.

2679
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:27,680
No!

2680
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:28,620
Holy!

2681
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:29,920
Holy cow!

2682
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:40,460
I'm working right now, General.

2683
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:41,300
Pass me later.

2684
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:42,380
Okay, sorry.

2685
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:45,740
I'll wait for your girl, Hecuba.

2686
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,060
I'm not gonna get kicked out, alright?

2687
02:02:57,820 --> 02:02:58,160
Please.

2688
02:02:58,740 --> 02:02:59,520
Please, sir.

2689
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:01,260
Okay.

2690
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:04,330
Ma'am?

2691
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:05,590
I'm gonna try this door, too.

2692
02:03:06,570 --> 02:03:07,710
Not the talkative type.

2693
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:09,050
No.

2694
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,570
She's too cool for that.

2695
02:03:19,110 --> 02:03:19,570
Uh...

2696
02:03:19,570 --> 02:03:21,290
He turned as soon as I...

2697
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:21,930
He turned as soon as I...

2698
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:24,210
Okay, never mind.

2699
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:24,810
Sorry, sir.

2700
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:25,250
Just kidding.

2701
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,710
Where's our...

2702
02:03:28,710 --> 02:03:29,330
Where's your girl?

2703
02:03:33,730 --> 02:03:34,270
No.

2704
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:34,730
No.

2705
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:39,070
No.

2706
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:39,330
No.

2707
02:03:39,330 --> 02:03:43,730
It happens to be the name of the antagonist necromancer from Westwood's later game, Nox.

2708
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,150
Oh...

2709
02:03:46,610 --> 02:03:47,170
Uh...

2710
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:47,990
Okay...

2711
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:48,910
Well, we're here.

2712
02:03:50,610 --> 02:03:51,170
Uh...

2713
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:53,030
I hear Gongaga now, right?

2714
02:03:53,230 --> 02:03:53,830
I can't...

2715
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:54,990
I can't unhear it.

2716
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:58,710
Every time it, like, loops in that part, I hear Gongaga.

2717
02:03:59,590 --> 02:03:59,890
Me?

2718
02:04:00,190 --> 02:04:00,750
Gongaga?

2719
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:14,440
Uh...

2720
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:15,660
I wanna go to Sticky.

2721
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:29,040
I'm still very confused about things.

2722
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:32,540
Are...

2723
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:34,200
Hecuba's coming out now?

2724
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,860
Yeah, that guy's gone, right?

2725
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,140
I have no idea.

2726
02:04:55,980 --> 02:04:57,660
Not the talkative type.

2727
02:05:04,150 --> 02:05:07,430
We're gonna chill in this room while, uh...

2728
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:13,790
While we figure it out... Down?

2729
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:16,600
What do you mean down?

2730
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:39,240
The purple pants guy?

2731
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:39,820
No, no.

2732
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:43,160
That's a different guy and then this guy is not clickable.

2733
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:43,900
Hold on.

2734
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:51,900
I'm gonna check a different walkthrough since clearly mine is... Okay, here we go.

2735
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:53,060
Tongue Club?

2736
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:53,820
Is that what it's called?

2737
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:55,100
Crazy.

2738
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:09,410
Okay, we're gonna also have to go back to the arcade for Lucy.

2739
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:10,050
It seems.

2740
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:19,390
Okay.

2741
02:06:21,290 --> 02:06:23,570
Oh, he had a lighter on the bar.

2742
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:26,050
Okay, we gotta go back.

2743
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:27,590
The Gordo, before he ran out.

2744
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:28,250
I didn't even see.

2745
02:06:29,110 --> 02:06:30,370
I didn't even see.

2746
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:36,250
The countertop in the dark part of the early Q club has bones in it?

2747
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:38,090
Where?

2748
02:06:49,190 --> 02:06:49,670
Alright!

2749
02:06:50,450 --> 02:06:51,610
Oh my gosh!

2750
02:06:51,610 --> 02:06:52,090
Oh my gosh!

2751
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:53,930
You guys see that?

2752
02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:55,170
The bones in here?

2753
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:56,190
Under the countertop?

2754
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:57,830
That's crazy!

2755
02:07:00,830 --> 02:07:01,230
Whoa!

2756
02:07:01,230 --> 02:07:04,710
Hold on, I'm gonna... I sped run getting kicked out so that...

2757
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:08,430
Oh, maybe he is down here!

2758
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:10,970
I thought this was to my car.

2759
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:12,370
Wait, I think it is to my car.

2760
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:15,950
It is.

2761
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:20,290
But he left his lighter in here, apparently.

2762
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:25,390
Pull out gun to get out of the club faster than why.

2763
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:26,590
I'm a true speedrunner.

2764
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:30,830
He apparently... Oh, there... Do you guys see that?

2765
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:35,210
This is what Gordo left on the... Oh my god!

2766
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,390
That's the thing you're supposed to notice and pick up.

2767
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,620
Incredible work!

2768
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:48,720
Incredible!

2769
02:07:58,580 --> 02:07:59,020
Damn!

2770
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,700
Wait, it says we're supposed to shoot him.

2771
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,440
Or not shoot him, but like...

2772
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:06,860
Maybe he'll be out here again.

2773
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:19,170
It says when you go outside, Gordo is standing there and says something.

2774
02:08:19,330 --> 02:08:20,850
But he didn't say anything to us.

2775
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:22,110
He just shot.

2776
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:25,050
And then ran away.

2777
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:36,330
Oh, the walkthroughs are so confusing as well.

2778
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:39,630
What does it say after that?

2779
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:40,250
It says...

2780
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:43,650
Um...

2781
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:47,370
You don't think he's a replicant, but he's a sympathizer.

2782
02:08:47,370 --> 02:08:50,330
And you're given a choice of whether or not to arrest him.

2783
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:53,690
You are automatically taken to the police station.

2784
02:08:55,610 --> 02:08:56,070
What?

2785
02:09:03,030 --> 02:09:04,410
That didn't happen at all!

2786
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:09,540
None of that happened!

2787
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:14,120
Sorry, I keep hovering over this because the blue is making it look like something to click on.

2788
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:15,960
You know, like with this.

2789
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,720
So it's distracting me.

2790
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,120
What the...

2791
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,880
This is so weird.

2792
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:29,640
Maybe we were supposed to shoot him.

2793
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:30,140
Maybe.

2794
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:32,380
But now, I'm stuck again.

2795
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:35,940
Let's...

2796
02:09:36,490 --> 02:09:37,620
Maybe go...

2797
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:38,780
Back to...

2798
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,580
The arcade.

2799
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:46,680
Gordo can either be a replicant or a sympathizer.

2800
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:51,000
So I guess maybe in this he's a replicant?

2801
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:54,780
Because he shot at us.

2802
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:56,840
If he were a sympathizer...

2803
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:58,180
We would...

2804
02:09:58,580 --> 02:09:59,140
Arrest him.

2805
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,540
Can you walk down in the club?

2806
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:06,280
It doesn't seem like it.

2807
02:10:09,540 --> 02:10:11,300
Oh my gosh, he's still not back.

2808
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:14,880
This is so bad.

2809
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,260
The whole...

2810
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:16,940
Guys, the...

2811
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:17,880
The run is ruined.

2812
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:22,180
Get in the car, McCoy!

2813
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:23,760
Get in the car!

2814
02:10:30,150 --> 02:10:32,830
Can you go down in the club though?

2815
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:50,180
I picked a different walkthrough.

2816
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:59,340
Wait a second.

2817
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:01,160
Uh...

2818
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:02,620
Give me a second to check something real quick.

2819
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:05,440
I think I had a meeting tonight.

2820
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:06,980
I do.

2821
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:08,640
Oh no, in like an hour.

2822
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:12,960
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to beat it today!

2823
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:13,560
Ah!

2824
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:14,320
At this rate!

2825
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:16,420
Aw man.

2826
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:19,080
I didn't think I would get so stuck all the time.

2827
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:25,100
Like I feel like I've just been running in circles this entire...

2828
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:27,260
This entire stream!

2829
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,280
What the heck?

2830
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,760
In an hour or an hour ago?

2831
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,200
In one hour, yeah.

2832
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:42,440
I'm just like...

2833
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:42,500
Huh?

2834
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:43,780
Huh?

2835
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:45,120
Huh?

2836
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:46,340
Every time!

2837
02:11:50,380 --> 02:11:52,500
Oh yeah, these games can get like that.

2838
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:52,920
No.

2839
02:11:57,380 --> 02:11:57,980
Uh...

2840
02:11:57,980 --> 02:11:59,700
Well, I hope you guys are at least having fun.

2841
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:04,500
Even though we're literally going in circles.

2842
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,180
Alright, let's see.

2843
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:19,770
Oh, wah-oh, wah-oh.

2844
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:22,010
Oh, wah-oh.

2845
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:23,510
Wah-oh, wah-oh.

2846
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:27,370
Ha-ha!

2847
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:29,410
Wah-oh.

2848
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:32,930
Maybe there's more...

2849
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:35,370
Stuff in the photos that I didn't...

2850
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:36,330
Was supposed to collect.

2851
02:12:37,090 --> 02:12:37,810
It...

2852
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:39,250
Maybe seems that way.

2853
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:40,450
But I don't even...

2854
02:12:54,990 --> 02:12:55,710
Hmm...

2855
02:12:55,710 --> 02:12:58,450
In circles like the strip lady on the rotating platform.

2856
02:12:59,850 --> 02:13:00,570
Yeah...

2857
02:13:00,570 --> 02:13:01,990
Play me like a...

2858
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:03,090
Damn fiddle!

2859
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:08,070
Hmm...

2860
02:13:08,070 --> 02:13:09,670
Gonna go to the strip club.

2861
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:13,390
I mean in the tutorial.

2862
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:14,810
Sorry.

2863
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:17,450
I'm always thinking about that place.

2864
02:13:17,870 --> 02:13:19,210
Maybe I have a problem.

2865
02:13:26,350 --> 02:13:31,750
It's saying that he's supposed to ask about being a...

2866
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:33,410
Oh, if...

2867
02:13:33,970 --> 02:13:34,450
Eh?

2868
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:38,710
What?

2869
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:40,410
Wait, okay, hold on.

2870
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:44,090
Come here.

2871
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:50,010
Gordo's lighter.

2872
02:13:50,030 --> 02:13:50,290
Gordo's lighter.

2873
02:13:50,290 --> 02:13:50,730
Lightning squad.

2874
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:51,430
Rep unit.

2875
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:52,990
Battle of the Gemini.

2876
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:58,570
If Gordo's lighter is painted silver...

2877
02:14:00,310 --> 02:14:02,350
He's a replicant who was a member.

2878
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:03,930
Oh!

2879
02:14:04,210 --> 02:14:05,950
So he is a replicant.

2880
02:14:06,130 --> 02:14:06,810
It seems.

2881
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:12,450
I see.

2882
02:14:19,710 --> 02:14:23,790
There are two things that may happen to Gordo depending on the game after coming out of the club.

2883
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:27,150
Gordo will approach and shoots McCoy if he's unarmed.

2884
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:31,670
He'll run into early Q's club and never to be seen anymore.

2885
02:14:31,670 --> 02:14:32,670
That's...

2886
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:34,170
That's what happened to us.

2887
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:37,850
I don't think you could not make a...

2888
02:14:37,850 --> 02:14:38,010
Wait.

2889
02:14:40,590 --> 02:14:44,810
I don't think you could make a not fun stream even if you try.

2890
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:48,530
In fact, I think trying would make it even better somehow.

2891
02:14:48,530 --> 02:14:49,190
Okay.

2892
02:14:49,330 --> 02:14:50,270
Then I am going to try.

2893
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:51,650
Hmm.

2894
02:15:00,110 --> 02:15:02,270
What if I only spoke backwards the whole time?

2895
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:05,450
Yeah.

2896
02:15:06,550 --> 02:15:06,890
Yeah.

2897
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:09,970
Yeah.

2898
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:12,830
Yeah.

2899
02:15:12,830 --> 02:15:13,470
Yeah.

2900
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:24,090
Yeah.

2901
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:24,810
Yeah.

2902
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:25,430
Yeah.

2903
02:15:31,930 --> 02:15:33,730
How do I laugh backwards?

2904
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:47,630
How do I

2905
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:51,380
laugh backwards?

2906
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:10,410
Okay, early Q's.

2907
02:16:21,830 --> 02:16:23,450
I'm pretty sure that's speaking in tongues.

2908
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:24,290
No.

2909
02:16:25,530 --> 02:16:25,890
No.

2910
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:27,550
Yeah!

2911
02:16:35,870 --> 02:16:38,930
Hey, pretty ghost, why don't you try hitting that sexy toggle?

2912
02:16:39,070 --> 02:16:41,370
I actually don't know what the sexy toggle is.

2913
02:16:41,630 --> 02:16:42,970
I don't think it's naked.

2914
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:46,690
I'm actually not quite sure.

2915
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:52,530
Night... yeah, nightclub.

2916
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:05,130
Let's see.

2917
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:06,370
Let's see.

2918
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:09,510
Try here again.

2919
02:17:10,990 --> 02:17:11,690
Okay,

2920
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:19,470
let's see if we can get back in here or something again.

2921
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:21,110
Hello?

2922
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:22,230
Mister?

2923
02:17:24,650 --> 02:17:26,730
You're not gonna follow me?

2924
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:32,590
Okay, here we go.

2925
02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:34,850
Now he's suspicious.

2926
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:39,150
Okay, now he's suspicious.

2927
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:41,430
Now we walk.

2928
02:17:48,330 --> 02:17:49,410
Just kidding, sir?

2929
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:50,930
I don't know.

2930
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:53,250
You know what, let's go try...

2931
02:17:55,090 --> 02:17:56,390
Let's try going back...

2932
02:17:56,970 --> 02:18:00,390
Though I feel like it would give us a prompt if we actually had a...

2933
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:03,790
A, uh...

2934
02:18:04,310 --> 02:18:05,010
What's the word?

2935
02:18:10,310 --> 02:18:12,890
A appointment at Tyrell, you know?

2936
02:18:13,250 --> 02:18:15,110
Like it would say, now you have an appointment!

2937
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:22,290
Save the money!

2938
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:28,750
And there's nothing else in here?

2939
02:18:31,130 --> 02:18:31,730
Really?

2940
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:32,510
Nothing?

2941
02:18:32,510 --> 02:18:32,750
What do you think?

2942
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:35,790
What's mean?

2943
02:18:38,210 --> 02:18:38,730
Ooh...

2944
02:18:38,730 --> 02:18:40,710
I love this green lady statue.

2945
02:18:42,570 --> 02:18:43,090
Woo!

2946
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:47,830
Ooh, who's slurping on our soup?

2947
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:52,230
Okay, I don't think there's anything in here.

2948
02:18:54,830 --> 02:18:57,030
I think they are drinking from the green lady.

2949
02:18:58,890 --> 02:19:01,310
This doesn't seem anything else.

2950
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:02,830
Ugh!

2951
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:05,710
What can I try?

2952
02:19:06,650 --> 02:19:08,450
We don't have Lucy!

2953
02:19:08,930 --> 02:19:11,670
We don't have...

2954
02:19:14,810 --> 02:19:16,790
We don't have...

2955
02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:18,130
I'm just gonna go take a nap.

2956
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:21,890
Hard reset, you know?

2957
02:19:24,910 --> 02:19:26,910
What if we're a replicant?

2958
02:19:27,090 --> 02:19:28,630
But our dog is real.

2959
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:34,050
What if our dog...

2960
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:42,630
We also love the green...

2961
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:44,670
last on screen.

2962
02:19:46,570 --> 02:19:47,690
What green...

2963
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,670
What green...

2964
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:50,810
Hello, Maggie!

2965
02:19:51,310 --> 02:19:52,570
Maggie, come here, girl.

2966
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:58,690
I'm gonna pretend that I'm uploading anything...

2967
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:00,530
and doing anything with this stinking thing.

2968
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:03,290
It also mentions some other stuff...

2969
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:05,190
maybe that I missed in here.

2970
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:09,830
Like, uh...

2971
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:11,010
this apparently, I think?

2972
02:20:11,890 --> 02:20:12,850
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

2973
02:20:12,850 --> 02:20:16,990
Deh, deh, deh, deh, deh, euh, uh, ah, hee, Minute, ahh, hee,YU, uh, hee.

2974
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:19,590
Yeah!

2975
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:19,910
See!

2976
02:20:21,330 --> 02:20:21,850
Aha!

2977
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:23,870
A strange scale.

2978
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:25,870
That's the scale that Give me a hard copy of that.

2979
02:20:26,010 --> 02:20:27,550
That's the scale, we...

2980
02:20:27,550 --> 02:20:27,770
Oh!

2981
02:20:28,230 --> 02:20:31,510
Spot a familiar face- a unicorn sighting?

2982
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:34,210
What?

2983
02:20:36,850 --> 02:20:38,450
No, no, this is a scale.

2984
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:49,670
Is that...

2985
02:20:50,190 --> 02:20:50,450
Us?

2986
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:53,750
From behind?

2987
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:57,210
It looks like...

2988
02:20:58,930 --> 02:20:59,870
Origami unicorn?

2989
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:00,250
Yeah!

2990
02:21:01,030 --> 02:21:04,510
What if you're a replicant and Maggie's an undercover Blade Runner?

2991
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:08,250
I think that's us, no?

2992
02:21:12,990 --> 02:21:14,350
I gotta watch the movie now.

2993
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:25,260
There was one other thing I feel like it mentioned to look at in here, but I can't remember what...

2994
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:26,640
What the heck is this?

2995
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:27,900
Banana peel on the ground?

2996
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:31,060
It's a banana peel!

2997
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:38,480
Ugh, might be Deckard.

2998
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:39,620
Oh, true, true, true!

2999
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:42,040
Because he came and asked about it too, right?

3000
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,180
All detectives look the same.

3001
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:49,240
I'm sorry for stereotyping, but you all got them coats.

3002
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:53,280
I think there was one other thing in here too, potentially.

3003
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:56,740
This is our girl, no?

3004
02:21:56,740 --> 02:21:58,840
This is the one we're trying to see at the club.

3005
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:00,360
Ma'am, please!

3006
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,600
Why won't you meet me?

3007
02:22:11,470 --> 02:22:13,910
Nah, we're gonna get real specific here.

3008
02:22:15,610 --> 02:22:16,890
Enhance the woman.

3009
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:20,750
Yeah, it's the Columbo overcoat.

3010
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:27,710
I don't remember what else it told me to...

3011
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:29,450
What the walkthrough told me to look up.

3012
02:22:36,410 --> 02:22:37,290
Nap time!

3013
02:22:38,930 --> 02:22:40,400
Portrait of the sleep-deprived.

3014
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:43,800
Just one more thing.

3015
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,380
Okie dokie.

3016
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:54,460
Maybe we go on our balcony and wistfully think about what to do next.

3017
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:55,700
Okay.

3018
02:22:58,010 --> 02:23:01,030
It's your birthday, someone gives you a calfskin wallet?

3019
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:04,630
Are you sure it's not made out of babies?

3020
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:12,050
Your floor number, please.

3021
02:23:12,850 --> 02:23:13,410
Okay.

3022
02:23:14,230 --> 02:23:14,610
Oof.

3023
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:15,370
Oof.

3024
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:18,590
Leather, baby.

3025
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:20,810
Calfs are babies.

3026
02:23:20,990 --> 02:23:21,990
Oh my gosh, wait, you're right.

3027
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:27,420
You know what this stream is lacking?

3028
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,900
A whole lot of shooting and killing people.

3029
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,000
You could change that.

3030
02:23:59,830 --> 02:24:02,270
Let's see if Lucy came back.

3031
02:24:02,590 --> 02:24:03,810
Lucy, are you home?

3032
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:08,930
I don't think she's ever coming back, guys.

3033
02:24:10,010 --> 02:24:11,770
Why is it like we're dressed up?

3034
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:21,610
Alright, let's try the nightclub again.

3035
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:23,930
I'm truly at a loss.

3036
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:28,190
Aww.

3037
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:05,740
Let me tell you what I want.

3038
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:07,080
And maybe I'll impress you.

3039
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:13,340
The guide says to talk to and follow Early Q to Dektora.

3040
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:15,280
The club is called Early Q.

3041
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:17,380
That's where we're at.

3042
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:23,140
Lost in the store, thank you so much for the 10 gift and thank you!

3043
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:27,840
This is my gameplay when my parents enter my room.

3044
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:32,580
Yeah, I guess we'll just sit in the VIP area.

3045
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:39,840
I've talked to him before, this guy.

3046
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:41,580
He said she would come out.

3047
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,920
She never did.

3048
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:46,420
Let's get another drink.

3049
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:47,940
Hit me again.

3050
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:49,260
You pick the color.

3051
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:51,540
Ah, 2 of 10, 10 of 2.

3052
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:53,040
Why is it called that?

3053
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:55,780
Let's just say, it's a love potion.

3054
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:58,500
Maybe this is her and we just need to talk- What's your name?

3055
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,340
Nope, never mind.

3056
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:00,840
What's your name?

3057
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:01,780
What's your name?

3058
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:03,140
Why does he say it like that?

3059
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:04,900
Hey, Early.

3060
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:06,460
I'm working right now, General.

3061
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:07,700
Oh, his name's Early Q.

3062
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:08,920
Yeah.

3063
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:10,960
Um, hello?

3064
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:12,980
What's your name?

3065
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:14,220
What's your name?

3066
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:19,240
It's like he's talking to a little kid.

3067
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:19,820
I know.

3068
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:21,880
That's why I don't like it.

3069
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:26,660
I guess we'll just stand here.

3070
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:27,940
I hope nobody has a problem.

3071
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:31,400
Just, you know, if you're- Oh, my God.

3072
02:26:31,980 --> 02:26:40,800
Ladies and gentlemen, yours truly the ever-ebelliant Early Q presents the wondrous, mysterious...

3073
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:42,240
Hecuba!

3074
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:43,940
Hecuba!

3075
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:51,140
Singing and performing the sacred Thanatos dance of the ancient swamps!

3076
02:26:55,270 --> 02:26:56,230
Wow.

3077
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:58,590
It finally happened.

3078
02:26:59,630 --> 02:27:00,830
Early was like...

3079
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:26,330
Are we just supposed to interrupt her dance?

3080
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:33,800
Look, but don't touch.

3081
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:50,900
I didn't- I didn't think it would be touching her!

3082
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:54,600
Holy cow.

3083
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:55,720
Not the talkative type.

3084
02:28:01,530 --> 02:28:02,390
Oh, my God.

3085
02:28:03,690 --> 02:28:04,770
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

3086
02:28:06,190 --> 02:28:07,530
Not the talkative type.

3087
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,280
Okay, we can run.

3088
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:15,820
Thank goodness.

3089
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:19,000
It's okay.

3090
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:20,620
We can probably just go right back in.

3091
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:22,400
We probably don't have to wait.

3092
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:27,380
Probably.

3093
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:27,480
Probably.

3094
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:32,080
This place is way bigger on the inside.

3095
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:37,640
Oh, she's gone!

3096
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:39,180
Ma'am?

3097
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:40,800
I missed the whole show.

3098
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:42,500
Wait, but so was that guy.

3099
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:46,520
There was a guy guarding this area.

3100
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:49,320
Look at the lip.

3101
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:49,580
Oh!

3102
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:52,460
What happened here?

3103
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:57,740
We know it's not hard not to be handsy.

3104
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:00,140
How did you reach all the way up there?

3105
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:01,720
He was like jumping.

3106
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:03,520
What's going on here?

3107
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:06,320
This doesn't look good.

3108
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:08,160
This actually looks...

3109
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:09,660
The opposite of good.

3110
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:11,720
I think this looks...

3111
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:12,320
Bad.

3112
02:29:20,220 --> 02:29:20,720
Uh...

3113
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:22,440
Oh, there's a ladder.

3114
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3115
02:29:26,060 --> 02:29:27,000
Before you do that...

3116
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,420
We are saving the game.

3117
02:29:30,460 --> 02:29:31,380
Okay, there we go.

3118
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:33,780
I feel like every time there's a ladder, there's a shoot-off.

3119
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:35,540
There we go.

3120
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:46,010
I wanna go back to the strip club.

3121
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:54,080
Anything here?

3122
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:55,820
That looks like blood.

3123
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:58,860
Uh...

3124
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:00,180
Anything here?

3125
02:30:03,180 --> 02:30:03,700
Literally...

3126
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:05,520
Literally anything!

3127
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:11,060
Oh, wait.

3128
02:30:11,540 --> 02:30:11,740
Green.

3129
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:13,120
Green.

3130
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:14,220
Green.

3131
02:30:14,620 --> 02:30:14,780
Green.

3132
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:15,460
Green.

3133
02:30:15,980 --> 02:30:16,760
Come here.

3134
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:17,620
Green.

3135
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:18,900
Green.

3136
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:20,460
Green.

3137
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:24,360
They're watching a sage play.

3138
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:25,560
A banquet is in progress.

3139
02:30:25,720 --> 02:30:27,720
The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters.

3140
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:30,600
The entree consists of boiled dog.

3141
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:31,780
Ew, what?

3142
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:38,420
It's the only thing that is showing up green.

3143
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:42,240
Mister?

3144
02:30:48,610 --> 02:30:49,590
Besides yourself.

3145
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:53,030
Am I missing something?

3146
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:05,460
Window?

3147
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:06,040
No?

3148
02:31:07,180 --> 02:31:08,240
Green in the middle.

3149
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:13,930
I think it was hovering over him.

3150
02:31:22,650 --> 02:31:24,950
All I see is this, but I have no idea.

3151
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:31,780
Says you should be talking to Dektora now.

3152
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:36,160
This game hates me!

3153
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:42,540
Maybe there's somewhere and something else downstairs.

3154
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:46,140
No way!

3155
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:48,880
Is it because I got kicked out?

3156
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:50,680
I didn't know!

3157
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:54,720
Is there anything around here?

3158
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:55,740
Oh, there it is.

3159
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:56,340
Okay, thank goodness.

3160
02:31:57,160 --> 02:31:58,340
Okay, we can go to the left.

3161
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:01,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3162
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:03,100
Oh my goodness!

3163
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:05,080
Oh, we're backstage!

3164
02:32:08,020 --> 02:32:08,500
Holy...

3165
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:11,700
Wow, I thought some ladies would be, you know, getting...

3166
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:13,300
ready in here.

3167
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:19,760
Hmm...

3168
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:20,560
That's strange.

3169
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:22,620
I didn't hear a knock.

3170
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:23,340
That's strange.

3171
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:24,500
I just wanted to say...

3172
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:24,760
I didn't see a door.

3173
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:25,260
Wow!

3174
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:26,700
You were awe-inspiring!

3175
02:32:27,220 --> 02:32:29,760
Well, thank you very much, Mr...

3176
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:31,480
McCoy.

3177
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:32,560
Uh, Ray McCoy.

3178
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:34,980
Is there something I can do for you, Mr. McCoy?

3179
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:35,260
Wow!

3180
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:36,320
You were amazing!

3181
02:32:36,580 --> 02:32:37,600
At the strip club.

3182
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3183
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:42,200
I can't get over this guy!

3184
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:44,900
Oh, goodness.

3185
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:47,920
Oh wow, the sewing machine and everything.

3186
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:51,440
Um...

3187
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:52,180
Belt?

3188
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:55,140
That's such an unusual belt, is it antique?

3189
02:32:55,780 --> 02:32:57,620
They say it's from the last century.

3190
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:00,560
Those little creatures have always been my favorites.

3191
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:02,020
Yeah, looks like...

3192
02:33:02,020 --> 02:33:02,700
Dragonflies?

3193
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:03,660
Yes.

3194
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:06,860
And the whole class that contains them.

3195
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:09,720
Tell you the truth, I'm from the LPD.

3196
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:11,880
I'd like to ask you a few questions if I could.

3197
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:13,180
Is this about early Q?

3198
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:14,840
Because I could tell you.

3199
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,880
Did any other pieces come with the belt?

3200
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:18,940
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

3201
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,860
So he was just role-playing a nerd to talk to her?

3202
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:25,740
Okay, don't!

3203
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:27,240
You know what?

3204
02:33:27,580 --> 02:33:28,340
Oh, ah, ah!

3205
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:29,720
Sorry, I keep clicking that.

3206
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:31,380
Hold on.

3207
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:33,040
Save?

3208
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:35,180
Alright, resume.

3209
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:35,660
Alright.

3210
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:37,700
We're not gonna fumble this time, guys.

3211
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:40,320
Look, I wanna warn you.

3212
02:33:40,460 --> 02:33:42,400
There's a woman looking for you and your friends.

3213
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:44,640
Why would anyone be looking for me?

3214
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:46,400
You know what I'm talking about.

3215
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,620
It's real important that you get out of here.

3216
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:49,900
I get it.

3217
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:52,260
You're some kind of sexual deviant.

3218
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:54,660
I'm finished with you.

3219
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:56,560
Give me the police.

3220
02:33:57,520 --> 02:33:58,640
You're doing the right thing.

3221
02:33:58,960 --> 02:33:59,960
I am the police!

3222
02:33:59,980 --> 02:34:00,580
Yes, this is an emergency.

3223
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,240
Early Q's backstage.

3224
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:04,500
A customer is harassing me.

3225
02:34:05,420 --> 02:34:06,220
Thank you.

3226
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:07,060
Thank you.

3227
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:07,660
Put that away!

3228
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:08,400
I'm a cop!

3229
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:09,720
May we wait?

3230
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,060
If your hand moves, I'll shoot.

3231
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:13,200
Okay.

3232
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:15,000
Please don't talk.

3233
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:17,660
The sound of your voice grates on my nerves.

3234
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:19,900
We waited there for a few minutes.

3235
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:21,860
Her gun in her eyes never wavered.

3236
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:23,720
Any other mark, I'd have been a dead man.

3237
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:27,480
But if she was a replicant, she must not have known it if she was willing to call the police.

3238
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:28,240
That's true.

3239
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:31,300
Hello, sir!

3240
02:34:31,640 --> 02:34:33,520
Oh, she lets us walk towards the police?

3241
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:34,340
This a troublemaker?

3242
02:34:35,300 --> 02:34:37,360
Put your hands on top of your head.

3243
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:39,060
I got a badge!

3244
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:39,540
That's right.

3245
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:40,560
Ray McCoy.

3246
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:41,340
Ref Detect.

3247
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:42,780
VR61661.

3248
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:44,500
Never heard of you.

3249
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:46,620
I report to Lieutenant Guza.

3250
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:47,120
Call him.

3251
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:48,580
I work for you.

3252
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:49,720
Let's go.

3253
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:51,420
Where's your squad car?

3254
02:34:51,620 --> 02:34:52,720
Yeah, I don't think this guy's a...

3255
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:52,780
Shut your mouth.

3256
02:34:52,780 --> 02:34:53,840
I don't think this guy's a cop!

3257
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:55,400
Which precinct are we going to?

3258
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:57,340
I'll tell you which one.

3259
02:34:58,040 --> 02:34:58,480
Now.

3260
02:34:58,800 --> 02:34:59,440
Tell me.

3261
02:34:59,700 --> 02:34:59,800
Oh!

3262
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:00,420
Oh!

3263
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:01,960
Oh!

3264
02:35:02,180 --> 02:35:02,260
Oh!

3265
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,300
We got a little...

3266
02:35:09,300 --> 02:35:10,440
We got a little flash.

3267
02:35:10,460 --> 02:35:11,900
This was no precinct house I'd ever been in.

3268
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:13,140
And I thought I'd been in them all.

3269
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:17,380
The grunt to my right had the beefy harness bowl look down pat.

3270
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:22,180
And his twitchy partner in the suit looked like he was just itching to chainsaw a couple of kneecaps.

3271
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:22,500
Hmm.

3272
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:24,700
Other than that, everything was hunky-dory.

3273
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:25,520
Hunky-dory!

3274
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:26,940
Impersonating a police officer, huh?

3275
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:32,080
I guess the new Nexus models are a little more creative than the old ones.

3276
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:33,220
I'm a Blade Runner.

3277
02:35:33,440 --> 02:35:34,220
You don't believe me?

3278
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:35,220
Call Lieutenant Guza.

3279
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:37,500
There ain't no Guza in the LPD.

3280
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:41,000
Unless I've been walking around in a dream, there is.

3281
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:43,000
That's what always bugs me.

3282
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:46,780
Yeah, the fact that these skin jobs always gotta live someone else's life.

3283
02:35:46,940 --> 02:35:47,620
No shit.

3284
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:48,080
Huh?

3285
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:49,760
Just make the call, dammit!

3286
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:50,300
Hoo!

3287
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:50,960
Hoo!

3288
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:54,360
You're just a piece of shit wrapped with memory implants of this Guza guy.

3289
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:54,900
You understand?

3290
02:35:57,140 --> 02:35:58,260
That's... impossible.

3291
02:35:58,560 --> 02:35:59,460
Is that why he's been everywhere?

3292
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,100
Rep Bane sounded so creative now.

3293
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:03,400
You wanna Void Conf me?

3294
02:36:03,560 --> 02:36:04,540
Be my guest.

3295
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:07,140
Very good.

3296
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:08,440
Very good.

3297
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:09,700
Very convincing.

3298
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:11,540
Where you been hiding?

3299
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:12,320
The Kipple?

3300
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,340
Gregorian bring you in?

3301
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:17,360
Who else is working that side of the pool these days?

3302
02:36:17,360 --> 02:36:19,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

3303
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:20,100
Ah!

3304
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:23,040
What about that bastard selling all that stuff downtown?

3305
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:24,840
Shut your trap.

3306
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:27,280
I'll tell you something, McCoy.

3307
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:29,540
I don't even care how you go out.

3308
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:32,200
But I know you can feel pain.

3309
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:35,780
And on that account, I'm your man, Si.

3310
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:41,020
You tell me about everyone you met through cars, and I'll guarantee you we'll go real easy.

3311
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:41,140
Please.

3312
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:44,340
Your breath smells like you wiped your ass with your teeth.

3313
02:36:44,940 --> 02:36:45,420
Haha.

3314
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:46,040
Damn.

3315
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:51,760
You're gonna wish you was neck deep in an off-world reactor vessel by the time I get through with you.

3316
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:54,440
Fire up the chair, Holly.

3317
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:56,780
His name's Holly?

3318
02:36:57,020 --> 02:36:57,640
It looks like Holloway.

3319
02:36:57,640 --> 02:36:58,720
You know what I'm gonna come back as?

3320
02:36:59,020 --> 02:37:00,260
In my next life.

3321
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:02,080
A priest.

3322
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:07,260
There's something holy about how good I am at this.

3323
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:08,580
Oh no, he's a weirdo.

3324
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:12,580
Oh.

3325
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:14,300
Woah!

3326
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:14,920
Please!

3327
02:37:15,300 --> 02:37:16,380
Don't even go for it!

3328
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:20,100
Bang!

3329
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:21,800
Woah!

3330
02:37:23,380 --> 02:37:25,260
I don't think that's how that works, ma'am!

3331
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:26,820
You shot...

3332
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:29,220
You got any idea how glad I am to see ya?

3333
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:29,740
Holly!

3334
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:30,700
No time for chit-chat, Slim.

3335
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:32,180
You wanna save your ass, I gotta blow this joint right now.

3336
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:32,820
And STP, thank you so much!

3337
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:33,880
Oh wait, not so Deadpool!

3338
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:36,660
Thank you so much for the five gift in!

3339
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:40,900
Yes!

3340
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:43,240
Ah, loud, loud!

3341
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:44,860
Oh, we're back!

3342
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:46,280
Oh, gosh!

3343
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:47,280
Okay, save.

3344
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:50,040
Woo!

3345
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:53,760
I feel like there's so much in the tutorial that...

3346
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:54,840
Not tutorial, sorry.

3347
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:56,300
The walkthrough that, like...

3348
02:37:56,300 --> 02:37:57,980
We never did, but...

3349
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:58,100
Okay!

3350
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:00,280
Where are we?

3351
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,440
I only have a little bit more that I can play, guys.

3352
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:03,880
Sorry.

3353
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:07,660
Dang, I really thought I would be able to beat it today.

3354
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:11,040
Sorry that it was so much of just me wandering around, wondering what to do.

3355
02:38:13,420 --> 02:38:15,420
This lady is an extremely good shot.

3356
02:38:15,880 --> 02:38:16,820
Is that not a little...

3357
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:17,600
What the hell took you so long?

3358
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:18,080
Suspicious.

3359
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:21,120
Maybe she's...

3360
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:22,060
A robot aim.

3361
02:38:22,060 --> 02:38:22,860
Good thing you made your entrance when you did.

3362
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:26,260
Good thing one of my snitches saw them escort you out of the club.

3363
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,320
Otherwise, you'd be three quarters in the bag right now.

3364
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:33,120
They must have been phony cops, hired by the reps for protection.

3365
02:38:33,980 --> 02:38:34,420
Cops?

3366
02:38:34,620 --> 02:38:34,840
Yes.

3367
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:35,480
Phony?

3368
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:36,000
No.

3369
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:36,760
Yeah, aimbot.

3370
02:38:36,900 --> 02:38:37,740
I remembered Baker.

3371
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:39,660
He used to be an S.I.D.

3372
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:43,040
expert on coercive technique until he was fired from the force a couple years ago.

3373
02:38:43,440 --> 02:38:44,480
A mercenary?

3374
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:45,640
Bingo.

3375
02:38:46,340 --> 02:38:48,320
He won't have to worry about getting paid no more.

3376
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:49,860
Let's strip her you interviewed.

3377
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:50,480
Sorry, I missed it.

3378
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:51,000
She's one of them.

3379
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:52,660
Figure it out.

3380
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:55,240
She must have made the call to Baker and that other bozo.

3381
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:57,660
Let's attend to some business.

3382
02:38:58,400 --> 02:38:58,880
I'm here.

3383
02:38:58,880 --> 02:38:59,400
Ah, yeah.

3384
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:03,340
Nice crowd.

3385
02:39:03,900 --> 02:39:06,040
Regular folks steal, just like you and me.

3386
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:07,840
Speak for yourself.

3387
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:09,360
You see it anywhere?

3388
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:10,820
I saw someone walk upstairs.

3389
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:11,700
You sure she's in here?

3390
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,360
Better look backstage.

3391
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:14,220
Yeah, yeah.

3392
02:39:14,220 --> 02:39:15,720
Check the balcony and cover the exit.

3393
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:16,300
Okay.

3394
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:18,160
I want this one giving us the blow off.

3395
02:39:22,850 --> 02:39:24,510
So if she goes that way, I go this way?

3396
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:26,210
I saw someone go upstairs, I did.

3397
02:39:29,530 --> 02:39:30,510
I did save.

3398
02:39:30,730 --> 02:39:30,830
Oh!

3399
02:39:31,570 --> 02:39:32,390
Oh my god.

3400
02:39:32,670 --> 02:39:33,010
Oh.

3401
02:39:36,270 --> 02:39:37,390
That was...

3402
02:39:37,390 --> 02:39:38,890
That was so freaky.

3403
02:39:39,550 --> 02:39:40,510
Oh my gosh.

3404
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:42,370
I thought she was gonna shoot me.

3405
02:39:45,330 --> 02:39:46,870
I would have died there for sure.

3406
02:39:47,410 --> 02:39:47,550
Oh.

3407
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:57,520
She's...

3408
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:58,300
She's floating.

3409
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:00,200
She's...

3410
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:01,600
Oh, I'm supposed to shoot her.

3411
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:01,900
Sorry.

3412
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:02,400
My bad.

3413
02:40:03,560 --> 02:40:04,880
I thought she was dying.

3414
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:10,410
She was...

3415
02:40:11,010 --> 02:40:12,470
She was coming at me!

3416
02:40:15,090 --> 02:40:17,170
Been pretty busy, haven't you, Slim?

3417
02:40:17,650 --> 02:40:21,470
I think we can safely say that one's in vile mechanical purgatory.

3418
02:40:22,010 --> 02:40:24,150
You had to clear out everything else up here, too.

3419
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:26,130
Hope Early's got insurance.

3420
02:40:26,750 --> 02:40:27,910
Putz employs replicants.

3421
02:40:28,030 --> 02:40:29,030
He oughta expect the worst.

3422
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:32,010
Oh, sorry I missed all the laughs.

3423
02:40:32,530 --> 02:40:33,310
Next time.

3424
02:40:33,970 --> 02:40:34,750
No, ma'am.

3425
02:40:34,770 --> 02:40:35,290
It's around here somewhere.

3426
02:40:35,490 --> 02:40:36,390
I'm still laughing.

3427
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:36,750
Where'd you park it?

3428
02:40:37,230 --> 02:40:38,890
I'm telling you, it was right here.

3429
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:40,370
Damn thing must have been stolen.

3430
02:40:40,770 --> 02:40:41,250
No way!

3431
02:40:41,490 --> 02:40:41,510
Our car got...

3432
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:43,070
Maybe you're living in an alternate reality, Slim.

3433
02:40:43,410 --> 02:40:44,010
Our car got stolen.

3434
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:44,930
Attention all units.

3435
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:50,950
All points bulletin has been issued for Ray McCoy, formerly BR-61661.

3436
02:40:51,290 --> 02:40:51,590
No!

3437
02:40:52,130 --> 02:40:53,290
Affirm one civilian kill.

3438
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:54,070
Ezo.

3439
02:40:54,650 --> 02:40:55,850
Considered armed and dangerous.

3440
02:40:56,370 --> 02:40:58,150
What the hell is that?

3441
02:40:58,450 --> 02:40:59,450
We didn't kill Ezo.

3442
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:00,850
Maybe they just wanna bring you in for questioning.

3443
02:41:01,550 --> 02:41:02,710
I didn't kill Ezo.

3444
02:41:03,390 --> 02:41:07,150
Maybe they think you're not what you think you are.

3445
02:41:07,650 --> 02:41:09,050
Are you saying I'm a rep?

3446
02:41:09,230 --> 02:41:09,930
Come off it.

3447
02:41:10,550 --> 02:41:12,690
The look on your face after that last one.

3448
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:16,570
The minute you start to feel something for skin jobs, you're in big trouble.

3449
02:41:17,390 --> 02:41:18,690
Maybe I just got too much empathy.

3450
02:41:19,190 --> 02:41:20,550
In all the wrong places.

3451
02:41:21,130 --> 02:41:22,490
You wanna put me on the machine?

3452
02:41:22,990 --> 02:41:24,730
Hey, I don't want anything, Slim.

3453
02:41:24,970 --> 02:41:25,950
You're the one they want.

3454
02:41:26,970 --> 02:41:28,690
Detective Steel, BR-61354.

3455
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:31,430
Report to headquarters immediately.

3456
02:41:31,910 --> 02:41:32,810
Code blue.

3457
02:41:33,130 --> 02:41:33,670
Code blue.

3458
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:34,190
What are you gonna do?

3459
02:41:34,890 --> 02:41:35,610
Take me in?

3460
02:41:35,970 --> 02:41:36,490
What are you gonna do?

3461
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:36,570
Arrest me?

3462
02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:38,770
No matter what they say, you're not on my list yet, Slim.

3463
02:41:38,890 --> 02:41:39,690
You know what that means.

3464
02:41:40,290 --> 02:41:43,830
And there's no use juicing you if I can't make some honest chinyon off it, you know?

3465
02:41:45,130 --> 02:41:46,150
He's an empath.

3466
02:41:47,150 --> 02:41:47,770
Oh my god.

3467
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:47,790
He's an empath.

3468
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:49,050
He must have messed up somehow.

3469
02:41:49,230 --> 02:41:50,570
I'll check it out, see what's going on.

3470
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:50,930
And then...

3471
02:41:51,890 --> 02:41:53,390
We'll be meeting again, Slim.

3472
02:41:53,670 --> 02:41:54,670
You can bank on it.

3473
02:41:54,770 --> 02:41:56,310
Thanks for saving my ass.

3474
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:58,370
I get cracking before I change my mind.

3475
02:41:58,710 --> 02:41:59,510
What do I do?

3476
02:41:59,570 --> 02:42:00,270
I have to run there?

3477
02:42:00,410 --> 02:42:01,250
Oh, I really am.

3478
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:02,670
Just run into the police station.

3479
02:42:03,650 --> 02:42:04,070
Where are you going?

3480
02:42:04,310 --> 02:42:04,470
Oh!

3481
02:42:06,810 --> 02:42:07,790
Reach Act 4.

3482
02:42:08,070 --> 02:42:08,490
Yippee!

3483
02:42:09,390 --> 02:42:10,370
Is this the twins?

3484
02:42:11,150 --> 02:42:11,590
Yeah!

3485
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:19,760
Your old fogey stuff makes me want to spew.

3486
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:24,180
Excuse me, but I was listening to music.

3487
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,560
Geek!

3488
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:27,560
Hoodlum!

3489
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:28,440
Dork!

3490
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:29,540
Freak!

3491
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:33,580
There is someone at the door.

3492
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:35,840
Speak!

3493
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:39,460
I have a return package from Mr. Luther Lance.

3494
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:39,900
Uh-oh.

3495
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:40,760
A return?

3496
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:41,800
From where?

3497
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:43,400
Emile Bunsiter.

3498
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:44,480
Uh-oh.

3499
02:42:44,480 --> 02:42:47,860
Maybe one of the chimps blew a gasket and tried to bugger him.

3500
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:48,680
Uh-oh.

3501
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:49,380
They're not available.

3502
02:42:49,540 --> 02:42:50,060
Come back later.

3503
02:42:50,260 --> 02:42:51,580
Q and Doki.

3504
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:52,800
I told you those strains were unstable.

3505
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:54,400
Runciter must have discovered the fakes.

3506
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:55,080
Relax.

3507
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:56,520
Runciter is a simp.

3508
02:42:56,840 --> 02:42:59,660
Not even old man Tyrell could have spotted those beauties.

3509
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:02,700
Why did it put Simpleton?

3510
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:03,760
What is...

3511
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:04,020
Wait!

3512
02:43:04,300 --> 02:43:06,320
Is that what simp stands for?

3513
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:06,340
What?

3514
02:43:06,740 --> 02:43:11,620
Who the piss do you think you are blasting in here like a couple of goddamn cowboys?

3515
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,240
Urgh!

3516
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:18,600
Take a moment to evaluate the situation.

3517
02:43:19,100 --> 02:43:19,400
Look.

3518
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:21,520
There's very little to steal here.

3519
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:24,460
If you can haul out one of the statues, be our guest.

3520
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:26,980
We look like thieves to you, Ma?

3521
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:27,680
No.

3522
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:28,480
Uh, no.

3523
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:29,980
You look like a couple of goddamn...

3524
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:37,640
Switching between classical music and Target from CNC.

3525
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:39,600
Take a good, long look.

3526
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:40,940
Yeah?

3527
02:43:41,540 --> 02:43:42,820
What are we looking at?

3528
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:44,020
Uh-huh.

3529
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:47,640
Just the people we were hoping to see, right Lance?

3530
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:48,520
Huh?

3531
02:43:48,900 --> 02:43:49,120
Huh?

3532
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:50,320
Nexus 6.

3533
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:52,360
And you came to us.

3534
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:54,160
Return to you, my brothers.

3535
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:55,080
My brothers.

3536
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:56,200
To ask your help.

3537
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:59,540
Unfortunately, we don't work for the Tyrell Corporation anymore.

3538
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:01,980
You've been continuing your research, I trust?

3539
02:44:02,440 --> 02:44:03,120
Yeah, of course.

3540
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:05,100
Something drives us on.

3541
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:05,980
The common bond.

3542
02:44:06,910 --> 02:44:09,060
Can you have greater miracles than these?

3543
02:44:10,440 --> 02:44:12,200
Brothers, my brothers.

3544
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:15,660
Take a good, long look.

3545
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:18,620
Huh?

3546
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:19,680
Oh.

3547
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:20,980
My.

3548
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:22,220
God.

3549
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:24,320
Well, now.

3550
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:26,180
Shall we begin?

3551
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:26,620
What?

3552
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:35,210
You wake up one day and find it's all been a dream.

3553
02:44:35,410 --> 02:44:38,930
Or you wake up and discover you've been asleep all the time and the nightmare is real.

3554
02:44:39,110 --> 02:44:39,310
What?

3555
02:44:39,410 --> 02:44:40,170
I didn't know what it was.

3556
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:41,510
I didn't know who I was.

3557
02:44:41,510 --> 02:44:43,610
A cop dangling on the short end of the stick?

3558
02:44:43,710 --> 02:44:45,690
Or a rep whose memory banks had run out.

3559
02:44:45,710 --> 02:44:46,670
I thought they were gonna kiss too.

3560
02:44:46,670 --> 02:44:48,370
One thing I was sure of was that I didn't kill Izo.

3561
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:49,870
That I know I experienced.

3562
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:53,790
And this misinformation, maybe it was the key to everything that was happening.

3563
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:56,170
Maybe there was a lot more than what met my eye.

3564
02:44:56,370 --> 02:44:59,030
All I had to do was stay alive long enough to find out.

3565
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:05,430
Someone got a bad hot dog, apparently.

3566
02:45:08,190 --> 02:45:08,930
Oh no!

3567
02:45:09,090 --> 02:45:10,110
We've hit my max!

3568
02:45:11,730 --> 02:45:16,070
Well, hopefully, uh, we don't, um, have any soft walks.

3569
02:45:16,870 --> 02:45:18,610
Final cut is recommended for the movie.

3570
02:45:18,770 --> 02:45:19,630
It's the director's favorite.

3571
02:45:19,770 --> 02:45:21,210
The theatrical version has a different tone.

3572
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:22,110
Oh.

3573
02:45:23,150 --> 02:45:25,390
I don't remember which one I watched originally.

3574
02:45:26,670 --> 02:45:28,970
So we're trying to get to the police station.

3575
02:45:29,950 --> 02:45:31,790
I'm wondering if I should...

3576
02:45:32,990 --> 02:45:34,470
Quit around here.

3577
02:45:37,130 --> 02:45:37,750
Uh...

3578
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:38,510
This way, I guess.

3579
02:45:38,830 --> 02:45:40,450
Just running down the train track.

3580
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:49,510
Whoa!

3581
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:56,640
Guess we just keep going.

3582
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,240
Or...

3583
02:45:58,240 --> 02:45:59,700
Oh my god!

3584
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:01,460
That's the biggest rat I've ever seen!

3585
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:02,980
Holy cow!

3586
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:04,840
That thing was hopping away!

3587
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:06,320
Did you see that?

3588
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:09,320
Wait, I want it to come back!

3589
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:13,420
Where'd it go?

3590
02:46:16,020 --> 02:46:17,100
I want another one.

3591
02:46:25,070 --> 02:46:26,370
That thing was...

3592
02:46:26,370 --> 02:46:27,450
That looked like a...

3593
02:46:27,450 --> 02:46:28,150
A dog.

3594
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:30,070
That looked like a chihuahua.

3595
02:46:31,550 --> 02:46:31,890
Me...

3596
02:46:31,890 --> 02:46:32,570
Not even...

3597
02:46:32,570 --> 02:46:33,590
No, that looked like...

3598
02:46:33,590 --> 02:46:35,610
That looked like a terrier.

3599
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:36,890
It was huge!

3600
02:46:37,890 --> 02:46:38,490
Okay.

3601
02:46:38,790 --> 02:46:39,430
Let's go in here.

3602
02:46:41,430 --> 02:46:43,130
It's been nine months.

3603
02:46:45,090 --> 02:46:46,250
Thank you so much!

3604
02:46:48,370 --> 02:46:49,030
You know what?

3605
02:46:49,070 --> 02:46:50,490
Let's just keep going down the hole.

3606
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:56,130
The tunnel stretched for miles.

3607
02:46:56,370 --> 02:46:57,570
I was sure it came out somewhere.

3608
02:46:57,930 --> 02:46:59,150
But I didn't have time to find out.

3609
02:46:59,150 --> 02:46:59,810
Just kidding.

3610
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:00,710
Okay.

3611
02:47:01,170 --> 02:47:02,130
Well, let's...

3612
02:47:02,130 --> 02:47:03,230
Leave here then.

3613
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:08,660
Okay.

3614
02:47:09,610 --> 02:47:11,100
A little freaky in here.

3615
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:13,500
Where are we?

3616
02:47:29,680 --> 02:47:31,920
Also, let's start saving down here.

3617
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:32,400
Yeah.

3618
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:32,840
Okay.

3619
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:35,100
Hello?

3620
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:36,300
Can I borrow this car?

3621
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:38,360
I hope you get paperwork for all these vehicles.

3622
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:38,780
Okay.

3623
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:39,180
I take that...

3624
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:40,420
You can take it any way you want.

3625
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:41,940
Never mind.

3626
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:42,260
Okay.

3627
02:47:42,340 --> 02:47:42,840
I guess we're running.

3628
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:47,120
Wait.

3629
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:48,180
They're not here anymore.

3630
02:47:48,420 --> 02:47:50,080
Do you think Lucy came back finally?

3631
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:52,140
Lucy, we made progress.

3632
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:53,160
Please be here.

3633
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:54,180
Okay.

3634
02:47:54,240 --> 02:47:54,680
Never mind.

3635
02:48:02,130 --> 02:48:02,750
You know what?

3636
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:03,250
Let's go...

3637
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:05,230
What is he gonna do if we borrow a car?

3638
02:48:05,950 --> 02:48:06,390
Or...

3639
02:48:06,390 --> 02:48:06,830
No.

3640
02:48:07,050 --> 02:48:07,790
He won't notice.

3641
02:48:07,930 --> 02:48:08,370
Probably.

3642
02:48:15,250 --> 02:48:16,130
Let's borrow...

3643
02:48:16,130 --> 02:48:16,250
Wait.

3644
02:48:16,330 --> 02:48:17,010
This one's locked.

3645
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:18,390
That sucks.

3646
02:48:18,990 --> 02:48:19,630
Oh, no.

3647
02:48:19,710 --> 02:48:20,030
Never mind.

3648
02:48:20,070 --> 02:48:21,130
He just didn't like this one.

3649
02:48:22,690 --> 02:48:23,130
Locked.

3650
02:48:23,590 --> 02:48:24,030
Locked.

3651
02:48:24,490 --> 02:48:25,390
What about this one?

3652
02:48:26,950 --> 02:48:27,390
Locked.

3653
02:48:28,050 --> 02:48:30,150
Well, you're gonna just have to take the ugly car.

3654
02:48:30,250 --> 02:48:31,090
I don't know what to tell you.

3655
02:48:31,270 --> 02:48:31,530
That sucks.

3656
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:32,450
I just...

3657
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:33,670
I don't know what to tell you.

3658
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:37,070
Sorry.

3659
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:39,710
Beggars can't be choosers, Mr. McCoy.

3660
02:48:40,470 --> 02:48:42,670
You're just gonna have to take the ugly car.

3661
02:48:43,150 --> 02:48:43,710
That sucks.

3662
02:48:44,670 --> 02:48:45,250
It's...

3663
02:48:48,900 --> 02:48:49,480
It's...

3664
02:48:49,480 --> 02:48:49,640
It's Elliot.

3665
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:50,020
Wait.

3666
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:53,540
I keep your paws off that, right?

3667
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:54,740
I...

3668
02:48:54,740 --> 02:48:56,120
I gotta get a car.

3669
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:05,040
Flying Dodge Viper.

3670
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:06,440
No way that would suck.

3671
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:08,780
I don't even know what the heck.

3672
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:11,720
They even left the...

3673
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:12,740
The grill going.

3674
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:15,260
Maybe somebody's in here.

3675
02:49:22,610 --> 02:49:23,250
Alright.

3676
02:49:23,570 --> 02:49:24,250
Sorry, guys.

3677
02:49:24,430 --> 02:49:25,930
It's time to go back through the...

3678
02:49:25,930 --> 02:49:27,350
The maze of mirrors.

3679
02:49:28,930 --> 02:49:30,210
The very...

3680
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:31,930
Maybe that's why nobody is in here.

3681
02:49:32,090 --> 02:49:32,790
Because it...

3682
02:49:33,890 --> 02:49:34,850
It's bad.

3683
02:49:37,130 --> 02:49:37,770
It's...

3684
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:38,610
I got...

3685
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:39,770
I got bamboozled again.

3686
02:49:39,770 --> 02:49:40,650
I thought...

3687
02:49:40,650 --> 02:49:41,070
Surely...

3688
02:49:41,070 --> 02:49:42,630
Third time's the charm.

3689
02:50:02,540 --> 02:50:03,920
And runnin' we go.

3690
02:50:04,420 --> 02:50:05,080
Runnin' till

3691
02:50:14,320 --> 02:50:15,580
we're almost there.

3692
02:50:37,090 --> 02:50:39,490
I'm not quite sure...

3693
02:50:40,510 --> 02:50:40,910
Where...

3694
02:50:40,910 --> 02:50:42,270
What they want us to do.

3695
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:45,480
Cause now we're very like...

3696
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:50,270
There's only so much we can do.

3697
02:50:51,150 --> 02:50:54,050
So I think it's time to steal a car.

3698
02:50:54,450 --> 02:50:57,070
So we can get back to the police station.

3699
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:04,200
DNA Row.

3700
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:04,800
I can't...

3701
02:51:05,150 --> 02:51:06,600
I can't go anywhere.

3702
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:13,760
Like I can't travel the map.

3703
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:14,420
Locked.

3704
02:51:14,660 --> 02:51:16,060
Because I don't have a car.

3705
02:51:18,460 --> 02:51:18,860
Locked.

3706
02:51:19,420 --> 02:51:19,820
Locked.

3707
02:51:19,880 --> 02:51:20,260
Maybe...

3708
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:21,100
Let me go talk to him again.

3709
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:28,200
I hope you get paperwork for all these...

3710
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:28,620
I take...

3711
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,240
You can take it anyway.

3712
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:33,000
Back to the sewers.

3713
02:51:33,160 --> 02:51:34,020
But there was no other...

3714
02:51:34,020 --> 02:51:34,460
Well...

3715
02:51:34,460 --> 02:51:35,260
Maybe I missed it.

3716
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:38,120
I've known for being a little bit blind.

3717
02:51:47,620 --> 02:51:48,020
Unnecessarily...

3718
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:49,200
Long stairs.

3719
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,500
So we can't go down here.

3720
02:52:13,420 --> 02:52:14,020
Oh!

3721
02:52:14,680 --> 02:52:15,480
We're running!

3722
02:52:15,860 --> 02:52:16,880
Did you see that thing?

3723
02:52:18,060 --> 02:52:19,740
I can't go this way.

3724
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:22,380
This leads to the...

3725
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:24,280
Strip club.

3726
02:52:27,260 --> 02:52:28,780
Where the thing was...

3727
02:52:28,780 --> 02:52:30,800
The thing came running at me!

3728
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:34,800
Nashed.

3729
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:36,000
Oh, wait.

3730
02:52:36,080 --> 02:52:37,100
This is not the strip club.

3731
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:37,860
I'm a liar.

3732
02:52:40,300 --> 02:52:42,220
I'd seen chairs like this one before.

3733
02:52:42,520 --> 02:52:44,640
And not just in my recurring dental nightmares.

3734
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:47,340
It was an old-time LPD soothsayer.

3735
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:50,860
A torture device used to elicit confessions out of hardened criminals.

3736
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:53,000
Its use had been banned for 10 years now.

3737
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:56,280
But most cops knew it hadn't totally disappeared off the face of the earth.

3738
02:52:57,940 --> 02:52:58,980
What's in here?

3739
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:02,280
Oh no!

3740
02:53:02,580 --> 02:53:02,640
Oh no!

3741
02:53:02,640 --> 02:53:02,860
Kidding!

3742
02:53:02,980 --> 02:53:03,940
We're back in the...

3743
02:53:04,220 --> 02:53:05,780
We're back in the sewers!

3744
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:06,720
We're back in the sewers!

3745
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:07,760
No way!

3746
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:09,280
The lever!

3747
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:15,280
We're here!

3748
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:18,120
Wait, can I go this way?

3749
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:21,320
Oh, I can!

3750
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:21,560
I can!

3751
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:22,720
Ah!

3752
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:24,080
Oh, leave!

3753
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:24,840
Time to go.

3754
02:53:27,240 --> 02:53:27,760
No...

3755
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:28,480
No hurry...

3756
02:53:28,480 --> 02:53:30,060
No sense of urgency at all.

3757
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:35,100
Nope, that's not what I wanted to do.

3758
02:53:39,880 --> 02:53:40,420
No.

3759
02:53:40,420 --> 02:53:40,940
Oh my goodness.

3760
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:42,780
Okay.

3761
02:53:42,920 --> 02:53:43,980
Oh wait, this does lead somewhere.

3762
02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:53,310
Okay...

3763
02:53:54,330 --> 02:53:56,810
I can't remember where this came out from.

3764
02:53:58,210 --> 02:53:59,430
Like this side.

3765
02:54:07,250 --> 02:54:08,030
Big rat.

3766
02:54:08,830 --> 02:54:09,650
Big rat.

3767
02:54:10,050 --> 02:54:11,530
Grab it, grab it, grab it!

3768
02:54:13,030 --> 02:54:14,270
I can shoot it!

3769
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:16,410
No, no, I wanna grab it.

3770
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:23,640
No, I don't.

3771
02:54:40,460 --> 02:54:41,340
Oh, oh!

3772
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:42,360
I know where we are!

3773
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:44,240
Okay, this is Izo's...

3774
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:45,440
Izo's lair.

3775
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:47,980
Yes, yes, yes!

3776
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:49,120
So if we got...

3777
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:50,060
Went upstairs...

3778
02:54:50,060 --> 02:54:51,820
Okay, we're trying to make it to...

3779
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:02,770
Oh, I thought that was the police talking to me.

3780
02:55:14,290 --> 02:55:15,090
Alright, guys.

3781
02:55:15,290 --> 02:55:16,530
I think I'm gonna call it here though.

3782
02:55:16,670 --> 02:55:18,350
Because I gotta get going.

3783
02:55:19,430 --> 02:55:21,270
Ah, I'm so sorry!

3784
02:55:21,730 --> 02:55:22,330
Dang it!

3785
02:55:22,690 --> 02:55:23,830
The rev wasn't a replicant.

3786
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:24,450
You messed up!

3787
02:55:26,610 --> 02:55:28,690
But we shall finish...

3788
02:55:28,690 --> 02:55:31,070
Maybe I will even...

3789
02:55:31,750 --> 02:55:32,730
Finish tomorrow.

3790
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:40,570
Feel like we don't have that much left.

3791
02:55:44,070 --> 02:55:44,470
So...

3792
02:55:44,470 --> 02:55:44,850
No.

3793
02:55:46,250 --> 02:55:48,090
Jessica thank you so much for the time gift!

3794
02:55:48,330 --> 02:55:48,890
Thank you guys!

3795
02:55:48,990 --> 02:55:49,710
Thank you!

3796
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:50,410
Thank you!

3797
02:55:50,570 --> 02:55:51,010
Thank you!

3798
02:55:51,230 --> 02:55:52,470
Do I go so much for the pig?

3799
02:55:52,470 --> 02:55:53,230
Thank you.

3800
02:55:53,790 --> 02:55:54,590
Thank you.

3801
02:55:54,630 --> 02:55:55,550
Thank you so much.

3802
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:56,730
Thank you.

3803
02:55:57,110 --> 02:55:59,550
Looks like Mint didn't want to get ran out.

3804
02:56:00,930 --> 02:56:11,010
Wait, let me make sure I save before I actually... before I actually start leaving and stuff.

3805
02:56:11,650 --> 02:56:13,570
But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3806
02:56:13,710 --> 02:56:14,290
Thank you guys.

3807
02:56:14,470 --> 02:56:15,210
Thanks for the help.

3808
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:19,930
Again, I apologize for me mostly just running around being like...

3809
02:56:23,630 --> 02:56:25,590
But I hope you had fun.

3810
02:56:25,910 --> 02:56:26,610
I hope you had fun.

3811
02:56:27,030 --> 02:56:27,910
Chase, thank you so much.

3812
02:56:28,150 --> 02:56:29,750
Thank you guys for the super test.

3813
02:56:29,910 --> 02:56:30,690
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3814
02:56:32,110 --> 02:56:33,690
And um, yeah.

3815
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:36,290
You have good taste?

3816
02:56:36,530 --> 02:56:38,270
I know.

3817
02:56:39,190 --> 02:56:40,150
No, I'm just kidding.

3818
02:56:41,030 --> 02:56:41,830
Thank you though.

3819
02:56:41,950 --> 02:56:42,350
Thank you.

3820
02:56:42,910 --> 02:56:43,930
Oh my gosh.

3821
02:56:44,170 --> 02:56:46,450
There was somebody that commented.

3822
02:56:46,450 --> 02:56:50,110
Sorry if you, if you're watching and I don't remember who, what your name was.

3823
02:56:50,270 --> 02:56:57,490
But there was somebody that commented and was just like, I wonder if Minto played low, a Sierra load runner.

3824
02:56:58,230 --> 02:57:02,250
Um, with, with, with Papa Minto 2.

3825
02:57:02,590 --> 02:57:03,690
And I was like...

3826
02:57:04,330 --> 02:57:06,150
I looked it up cause I was like, what is that?

3827
02:57:06,310 --> 02:57:08,290
And then I saw the pictures and I was like...

3828
02:57:09,390 --> 02:57:10,350
Oh my God!

3829
02:57:10,690 --> 02:57:10,710
Oh my God!

3830
02:57:10,710 --> 02:57:12,030
I did play that.

3831
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:13,750
So I'll probably play that next week.

3832
02:57:13,870 --> 02:57:15,750
Cause I was like, oh my gosh, no way.

3833
02:57:16,070 --> 02:57:19,390
The absolute like nostalgia wave that came over me.

3834
02:57:23,090 --> 02:57:23,970
Was crazy!

3835
02:57:27,430 --> 02:57:28,250
Take care of me.

3836
02:57:28,370 --> 02:57:30,070
You can always tell us if you're having a hard time.

3837
02:57:30,270 --> 02:57:31,270
We'll always be there for you.

3838
02:57:31,510 --> 02:57:32,210
Thank you.

3839
02:57:32,210 --> 02:57:33,790
I'd rather...

3840
02:57:33,790 --> 02:57:46,510
I, I try not to because I would much rather just be like, you know, silly, silly entertainer, dumb person on the internet than, than that.

3841
02:57:47,330 --> 02:57:49,970
Sorry, I was just, sorry if you heard that.

3842
02:57:50,010 --> 02:57:51,070
That was my throat spray.

3843
02:57:51,070 --> 02:57:51,730
Hahaha.

3844
02:57:53,670 --> 02:57:54,550
But um...

3845
02:57:54,550 --> 02:57:55,430
Ah, okay.

3846
02:57:55,610 --> 02:57:56,070
I'm sorry.

3847
02:57:56,290 --> 02:57:57,330
I'm, I really gotta go.

3848
02:57:57,610 --> 02:57:58,230
But Otsubito!

3849
02:57:58,230 --> 02:57:59,070
Thank you guys so much.

3850
02:57:59,150 --> 02:57:59,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3851
02:57:59,990 --> 02:58:01,850
I will see you next time!

3852
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:02,310
Wait!

3853
02:58:02,830 --> 02:58:04,370
Next stream is...

3854
02:58:04,370 --> 02:58:09,370
If I don't stream this tomorrow, as like a gorilla, next stream, that would be my anniversary!

3855
02:58:09,830 --> 02:58:11,450
And I have an announcement!

3856
02:58:12,590 --> 02:58:13,470
I have an announcement.

3857
02:58:13,710 --> 02:58:14,030
Positive.

3858
02:58:14,310 --> 02:58:14,710
Positive.

3859
02:58:15,070 --> 02:58:15,310
Hahaha.

3860
02:58:16,730 --> 02:58:17,290
For once.

3861
02:58:17,510 --> 02:58:19,990
I have a karaoke and announcement.

3862
02:58:19,990 --> 02:58:21,770
And it won't be a very long karaoke.

3863
02:58:22,350 --> 02:58:23,270
So, um...

3864
02:58:23,270 --> 02:58:26,230
You can hear the announcement, probably towards the end of the stream.

3865
02:58:26,470 --> 02:58:28,370
Which probably won't be super duper long.

3866
02:58:28,570 --> 02:58:29,170
So, yeah!

3867
02:58:29,730 --> 02:58:29,990
Yeah!

3868
02:58:30,830 --> 02:58:31,190
Woohoo!

3869
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:32,070
Okay!
