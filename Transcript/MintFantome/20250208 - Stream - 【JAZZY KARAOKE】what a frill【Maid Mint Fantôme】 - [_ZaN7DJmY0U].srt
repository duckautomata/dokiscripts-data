1
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,700
Okay.

2
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,610
And your... wait.

3
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,630
And your singer for tonight...

4
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,630
The one... the freakiest... presenting...

5
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,770
Mint Phantom!

6
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,300
The crowd goes wild!

7
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,450
Nervous!

8
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,990
I tried to dress up a little bit for the theme today, so...

9
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,650
Don't make fun of me, okay?

10
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,630
I know that I look like I'm going to my high school dance, okay?

11
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,190
I know!

12
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,470
I try.

13
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,590
Okay, true story.

14
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,830
Actually, there was a whole lot of things that...

15
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,890
Let me just... let me just get it over with.

16
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,090
I'm ripping up the band-aid!

17
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,080
I...

18
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,710
I have stories, okay?

19
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,310
Okay, okay.

20
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,830
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

21
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,010
Okay, let me explain.

22
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,830
So, I don't know how other YouTubers do it.

23
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,930
I tried to put on new clothes and I think my ghost body rejected them.

24
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,310
And so...

25
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,690
Also...

26
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,190
True story, my washing machine broke yesterday.

27
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,770
And I...

28
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,610
I was like, the other clothes... I paid lots of money.

29
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,330
I was like, okay, I'm going to try...

30
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,090
I'm going to try, like, some...

31
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,070
Some somethings, right?

32
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,900
And I was like...

33
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,060
I tried a bunch of different outfits and nothing worked.

34
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,420
And I was like, frustrated.

35
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
And I...

36
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,260
I was like, okay, well, let me put back my maid uniform on.

37
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,820
And it smelled bad.

38
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,400
But my washing machine broke.

39
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,500
So, I did order a new one.

40
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,200
It comes next week.

41
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,480
So, I will be probably smelly.

42
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
But I didn't want to be smelly today.

43
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,260
I know that I look like I'm...

44
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,080
I was like, I'm going to be on theme today.

45
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,460
But also, sorry, I'm not fancy like other YouTubers.

46
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,880
And I could only afford half a dress.

47
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,420
So...

48
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,580
Don't worry about it.

49
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,900
Probably.

50
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,780
I mean...

51
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,380
What does the back look like?

52
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,300
Yeah, I'm ready for school prom.

53
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,940
I'm ready to go to my school dance.

54
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,220
Washing machine reimbursement fund.

55
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,740
No!

56
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,200
No, no.

57
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,760
Yeah.

58
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,960
Yay!

59
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,820
I'm ready to dance.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
But...

61
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,280
Also, I...

62
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,840
More importantly, we're here to sing.

63
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,760
Don't look.

64
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,100
Don't look, okay?

65
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm so...

66
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,420
Thank you for all the gifts you guys.

67
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,600
Thank you.

68
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,520
Thank you.

69
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,680
So, I don't even have my maid headband on today.

70
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,200
It's serious business.

71
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,140
It's serious business.

72
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,180
Red super for a red dress.

73
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,300
Thank you!

74
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,420
Thank you!

75
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,340
Sorry, I'm not fancy like other YouTubers.

76
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,340
I don't know how they change clothes.

77
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,420
And then, my mama.

78
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,640
I love her, but she's very busy.

79
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
So, sorry that...

80
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,060
I don't have a new outfit or anything to present to you guys.

81
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,420
So...

82
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,300
And I won't have one for a while.

83
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,080
My mama is so busy.

84
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,140
Papa is so busy.

85
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Everybody is so busy.

86
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,360
But that just makes maybe the wait a little bit more worth it.

87
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,140
So, maybe.

88
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:44,820
Maybe.

89
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,420
For now, I can give you a PNG dress.

90
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,760
You can't see the fishing wire that's like wrapped around my neck.

91
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,300
You know, holding it up.

92
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,720
It's like a piece of cardboard basically.

93
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,740
Just over top of me.

94
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,760
You know?

95
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,700
Yeah.

96
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,180
It's blurry?

97
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah, I just printed it out.

98
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,940
What do you mean?

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you?

100
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,340
Am I what?

101
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,160
Are you?

102
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,600
Takanashi Kiara.

103
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,080
Hololive EN myth.

104
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,460
Do you have much to say?

105
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,700
I've seen your thumbnails.

106
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,380
Also, I've seen your outfits.

107
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,460
What would you like to know?

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,560
What would you...

109
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,040
What are you...

110
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,780
What are we asking?

111
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,590
Am I not able to afford a new outfit?

112
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,690
Maybe.

113
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,810
I don't know.

114
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,950
No, I can afford one.

115
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,150
I tried buying lots of different ones and none of them worked.

116
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,870
Also, thank you for the other Akazupa!

117
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,810
I love Frillless Friday.

118
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,890
This is the only time you'll see this.

119
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,470
It's special for today.

120
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,710
So I can distract you while I mess up singing.

121
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,690
You can be distracted by...

122
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,670
Is this safe?

123
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:20,570
Yeah!

124
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,430
Right?

125
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,970
It's safe!

126
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,690
I'm wearing a dress!

127
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,870
If you move too much to the side, could there be an oopsie?

128
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,250
No!

129
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,350
No, no, no.

130
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,510
I checked.

131
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,630
I've checked a lot of times.

132
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,710
I've done this.

133
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,780
I think I was okay.

134
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,940
Actually, I couldn't see when I did it.

135
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,100
I think it's fine.

136
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,120
This is super cute.

137
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,440
You can't see, it's okay.

138
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,820
Anyway...

139
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,760
Don't worry about it.

140
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,300
I didn't distract you guys from my horrible singing.

141
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,100
Because I asked everybody...

142
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,420
Well, I asked memboos.

143
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,060
I said, what jazz songs would you like to hear?

144
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,140
Kiwara.

145
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,520
She's so cute.

146
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,320
I asked what songs you guys would like to sing.

147
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,180
And I got a whole lot of recommendations.

148
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,260
And some of them I wanted to sing, but I couldn't find karaoke versions of them.

149
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,540
And a lot of those songs I did not know.

150
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,500
So...

151
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,420
I learned a bunch of new songs for today.

152
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,540
And I've been putting them on repeat for the past...

153
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,980
All day today.

154
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,660
So I'm nervous that I'm going to mess them up.

155
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,820
I'm really nervous.

156
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,240
But today is a smooth jazz.

157
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
I feel like this dress also fits the vibes.

158
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,900
Today is a smooth jazz day.

159
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,900
So you can feel cool and relaxed.

160
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,340
And you can have...

161
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,920
What do you drink at a bar?

162
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,440
I have orange juice.

163
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,340
You can have whiskey.

164
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,640
And feel fancy.

165
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,320
Like you are in a real...

166
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,100
Gin and tonic.

167
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Like you are at a bar.

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,040
And you are like...

169
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,980
It's just background noise.

170
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,040
The singing, you know?

171
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,380
So...

172
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,680
Don't pay much attention.

173
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,720
Can you tell I'm nervous?

174
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,820
Can you tell I'm nervous?

175
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,820
Oh gosh, okay.

176
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,820
Okey dokey.

177
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,580
Shake and not stir.

178
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,240
Naked and afraid.

179
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,160
What's that saying?

180
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,380
What's that saying?

181
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,240
If you are naked...

182
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,620
You will...

183
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,300
Wait, no.

184
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,520
If you are...

185
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,200
In your underwear, you will forget why you were embarrassed to begin with.

186
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,100
Right?

187
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
That's...

188
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,400
That's the mindset here.

189
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,990
Like if you do a public speaking in your underwear...

190
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,090
Then you will forget why you were nervous to do the public speaking.

191
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,030
In the first place.

192
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,650
Yes, yes, yes.

193
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,050
You like jazz?

194
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,210
Yeah.

195
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,790
So today is jazzy.

196
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,110
I'm so nervous.

197
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,670
Oh my gosh.

198
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,490
Sorry, is there so much pressure when I do like a themed karaoke?

199
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,150
Especially I think like this where it's like feels so...

200
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,350
So serious.

201
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,510
It's like such serious...

202
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,950
I feel like I have to be extra cool.

203
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,330
Oh gosh, but I'm not extra cool.

204
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,830
I'm wearing a cardboard.

205
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,290
Okay, but we got this.

206
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,230
Probably.

207
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,070
Maybe.

208
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,070
Okay, let me take a sippy and then we'll start.

209
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,390
In today's set list, I actually have been taking some things out.

210
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,210
I might take some more things out depending on how I feel.

211
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:53,970
But...

212
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,410
It's a little bit shorter than my usual streams because I couldn't learn so much.

213
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,410
And also because...

214
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,710
Because...

215
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,490
What was I going to say?

216
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:14,750
I wanted to raid Doki for her anniversary.

217
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,230
Yeah, if you were going to plan on watching that, we will raid her.

218
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,390
It should be done before then.

219
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,830
Oh my gosh, Jenny Bravo!

220
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,430
Okay.

221
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,590
Okey dokey.

222
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,050
The song I've sung before, but most of the songs...

223
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,230
Let's see.

224
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:50,070
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 songs I've never sung before on karaoke.

225
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,730
I had to learn them for this stream.

226
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,550
I had to learn them better.

227
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,570
If I sing them incorrectly, I'm sorry.

228
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,590
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

229
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,050
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

230
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,050
Alright, but the first song...

231
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,170
It's just like a warm-up.

232
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,370
It's just a warm-up.

233
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,610
Okay, okay, okay.

234
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,010
I'm also going to...

235
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,550
I'm also going to be adjusting the volume, so...

236
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:25,710
Yeah.

237
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,430
Oh!

238
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,850
Who the hell is that?

239
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,090
Oh my gosh, sorry.

240
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,040
Stranger Danger!

241
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,960
Stranger Danger.

242
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,080
Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,660
Here we go.

244
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:37,260
Notice how I get quiet when there's no one else around You and me in awkward silence Don't you dare look at me that way I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same Oh, the burning pain Listening to you harp on about some new soulmate She's so perfect,

245
00:17:37,740 --> 00:18:13,120
blah blah blah blah How I wish you'll wake up one day Run to me, confess your love At least just let me say That when I talk to you Oh, Cupid walks right through And shoots an arrow through my heart And I sound like a fool But don't you fail it to confess I loved you from the start

246
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,860
What's a girl to do?

247
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,300
Lying in my bed, staring into the blue.

248
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:53,820
Unrequited, terrifying love is driving me a bit insane.

249
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,740
Have to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today.

250
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:10,600
That when I talk to you, a Cupid walks right through and shoots an arrow through my heart.

251
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:22,880
And I sound like a fool, but don't you feel it to confess I've loved you from the start.

252
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:30,920
Confess I loved you, just thinking of you.

253
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,840
Loved you from the start.

254
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,500
Yay!

255
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,200
Oh, wait.

256
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,080
Set list, set list.

257
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,540
Okay, that was from the start.

258
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,580
Yippee!

259
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,260
Yippee, yippee, yippee.

260
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm so nervous.

261
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,700
Oh gosh, I'm like worried about if I'm gonna be able to do these songs properly.

262
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,200
Here, let's do another one that I know before I hit up the ones that I don't know.

263
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,280
What am I doing this one?

264
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,660
Oh, hold on, I have to adjust it.

265
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,540
There we go.

266
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,180
Okay, everybody knows this one, but of course people requested it.

267
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
But of course it's a song that has to be sung during a jazzy karaoke I feel, right?

268
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,720
Probably, I think so.

269
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,840
I think so.

270
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,920
Okay, here we go.

271
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,840
Why doesn't it want to play?

272
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,740
Hello?

273
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,420
What's happening?

274
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,640
Hello?

275
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,260
Okay, restart.

276
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
What's happening?

277
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:53,500
Let me see what spring is like On Jupiter and Mars In other words Hold my hand,

278
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,490
kiss me

279
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:38,480
Fill my heart with song And let me sing forevermore You are all I long for All I worship and adore

280
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,090
Please be true.

281
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:02,370
In other words, I love

282
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,740
you.

283
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,480
Feel my

284
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,300
love.

285
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,920
You are all I

286
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,520
worship and adore.

287
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,940
In other

288
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,480
words, Please be true.

289
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,110
Yay!

290
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,110
Fly me to the moon.

291
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:21,810
Mon.

292
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:30,970
I forgot to mention that some of these songs might have like, because they're jazzy, you know, they might have a longer instrumental break in between it, you know.

293
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:39,430
But I don't plan on like talking so much between it because I want you to enjoy the music a little bit.

294
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,170
So if it's just kind of like me vibing, then it's me vibing.

295
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,710
Thank you guys for the super chat!

297
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,030
Thank you!

298
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,390
Thank you, thank you.

299
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,650
I don't have so much time.

300
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,590
I want to make sure I get through the whole set list.

301
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,310
So, sorry if I don't respond so much.

302
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,370
But I'm... yeah.

303
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,850
I'm still reading them!

304
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,630
Everybody has a happy birthday!

305
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,170
Actually, let's do like a...

306
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,610
Oh wait, I wonder if there's like a happy birthday that I can sing for everybody whose birthday it is today.

307
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,490
Maybe a happy birthday jazz.

308
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,250
I'm gonna look that up.

309
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,390
Happy birthday songs.

310
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,710
Rock version.

311
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,590
Okay, I'll just do like a...

312
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,590
I'll do like a...

313
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,590
Like a...

314
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,050
A jazzy version.

315
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,110
Okay, not the Marilyn Monroe.

316
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,470
No!

317
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,310
Mr. President.

318
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,010
I'm too embarrassed to do an acapella though.

319
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,850
So I'll just sing to everybody whose birthday it is.

320
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,910
Happy birthday to you.

321
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,010
Happy birthday to you.

322
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,270
I'm too embarrassed!

323
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:15,250
Happy birthday to you.

324
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,410
Happy birthday to you.

325
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,880
With the music, it's too embarrassing otherwise.

326
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,990
I wish I was born in February.

327
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,650
Just replay it when it's your birthday, I guess.

328
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,910
I don't know.

329
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,090
Okay, let's... we did some slower songs.

330
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,430
Let's do a...

331
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,510
Let's do a faster one.

332
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,150
A lot of people requested this one, I think because it's in Fallout.

333
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,770
A couple of songs are in Fallout that I chose.

334
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,390
And then there might be some other songs that I chose that you're like...

335
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,990
What the heck?

336
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,970
So hopefully it's a kind of interesting...

337
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,750
Oops, sorry.

338
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,790
Interesting set list.

339
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,450
But this one was pretty fun to do.

340
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,510
So let's do...

341
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,650
Okay.

342
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,390
Sorry I'm not taking requests today since I have my set list.

343
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,050
But thank you.

344
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,050
Okay.

345
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,390
I have to up this one.

346
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,150
Three.

347
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,850
I hugged her and she hugged back.

348
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,710
Beautiful, left the sunshine enough to spread.

349
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,370
It's just like the fella said.

350
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:43,830
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?

351
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,120
Like the fella once said, ain't love a kick in the head?

352
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,530
Like the sailor said, ain't that a hole in the boat?

353
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,250
My head keeps spinning, I go to sleep and keep grinning.

354
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:28,250
If this is just the beginning, my life is gonna be beautiful.

355
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:35,730
She's telling me we'll be wed, she's picked out a king-size bed.

356
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,410
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick.

357
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:49,310
Tell me quick, oh, ain't love a kick?

358
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:56,190
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?

359
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,450
Maybe I should have changed the key on that one.

360
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,090
Oh well, it's fine.

361
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,890
Ain't that a kick in the head?

362
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:14,890
Yeah.

363
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,130
Let's do another one.

364
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,490
I know this one too.

365
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,650
Maybe I should do some other ones that I don't know though.

366
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,810
Yeah, I'll do this one.

367
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,640
This one has a really long instrumental.

368
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
It's not much singing, so I apologize.

369
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,680
But I think you guys can still vibe with it.

370
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,900
So we'll just vibe.

371
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,960
I fall in love too easily.

372
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,860
I fall in love too fast.

373
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,140
I fall in love too terribly hard.

374
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,920
For love to ever

375
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,930
should be well-schooled.

376
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,930
Cause I've been fooled in the past.

377
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:39,270
But still I fall in love so easily.

378
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,490
I fall in love too fast.

379
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,570
I fall in love too terribly hard.

380
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,650
For love to ever should be well-schooled.

381
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:30,030
Cause I've been fooled in the past.

382
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:35,150
For love to ever should be well-schooled.

383
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,810
My

384
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,260
heart should be well-schooled.

385
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,920
Cause I've been fooled in the past.

386
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:37,720
But still I fall in love too easily.

387
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,820
I fall in love too fast.

388
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,790
The vibes.

389
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,910
The vibes are so good.

390
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,510
I fall in love too fast.

391
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,570
So many I love songs in this list.

392
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:31,870
Because I think maybe lots of jazz songs are love songs.

393
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,230
But also it's close to Valentine's Day.

394
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,610
Yeah, almost Valentine's.

395
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:47,490
Yeah, you can just be like I'm so sophisticated and I go to jazz club for Valentine's Day.

396
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,310
You know?

397
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,960
We'll do this one but I'm kind of nervous about it.

398
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,340
Sorry also if I'm singing these wrong.

399
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,200
I feel like I am but whatever.

400
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,240
I'm so nervous.

401
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm so nervous still.

402
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,660
Next one probably a lot of people know also.

403
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:50,170
Stars shining bright above you.

404
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,870
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you.

405
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,890
Birds singing in the sycamore tree.

406
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,510
Dream a little dream of me.

407
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:16,350
Say nighty night and kiss me.

408
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:23,510
Just hold me tight and tell me you miss me.

409
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:29,510
While I'm alone and blue as can be.

410
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,470
Dream a little dream of me.

411
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:43,810
Stars fading but I linger on dear.

412
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:49,470
Still craving your kiss.

413
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:56,970
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear.

414
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,970
Just saying this.

415
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,290
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.

416
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:16,390
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.

417
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:22,450
But in your dreams whatever they be.

418
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,270
Dream a little dream of me.

419
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:29,550
Stars fading but I linger on dear.

420
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,990
Still craving your kiss.

421
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:42,670
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear.

422
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,990
Just saying this.

423
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:56,450
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.

424
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:03,250
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you.

425
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:09,010
But in your dreams whatever they be.

426
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:17,970
Dream a little dream of me.

427
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,790
Dream a little dream of me.

428
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:42,260
Sorry, I know she goes up an octave at that last part and then I was like wait I can't find the notes again.

429
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,460
Sorry, that was dream a little dream of me.

430
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:58,460
I knew that song but learning it fully was definitely different.

431
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,580
Okay, let's do another Ella Fitzgerald song.

432
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,520
Actually, this might be my last Ella Fitzgerald song.

433
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,420
But I've done this one before on stream.

434
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,420
Look

435
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,160
at me.

436
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree.

437
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,120
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud.

438
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,500
I can't understand.

439
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:11,360
I get misty just holding your hand.

440
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:25,550
And a thousand violins begin to play.

441
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,430
Or it might be the sound of your hello.

442
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,770
That music I hear.

443
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:42,690
I get misty the moment you're near.

444
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:51,950
Can't you see that you're leading me on?

445
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:57,410
And it's just what I want.

446
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:07,670
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?

447
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:14,350
That's why I'm following you.

448
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:30,950
Would I wander through this wonderland alone?

449
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:39,120
Never knowing my right foot from my left, my hand.

450
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:52,170
I'm too misty and too much in love.

451
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:01,070
Too misty and

452
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,660
in love.

453
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,860
Oops.

454
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,800
My voice.

455
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,880
I was like suppressing a yawn.

456
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,740
Because when I sing like this, you know, I have to open my throat so much.

457
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,140
And it makes me want to yawn a lot.

458
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,260
So I was suppressing a yawn of that too misty.

459
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,860
So it made my voice crack.

460
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,180
Let's do this.

461
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,120
These ones are more modern songs.

462
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,080
Hold on, hold on.

463
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,240
Thank you guys for all the gifts.

464
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,100
Thank you so much.

465
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

466
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,020
I really appreciate it.

467
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,540
Actually, I only listened... I was only able to practice this one like two times.

468
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:17,820
If I mess up some of the parts, I'm sorry.

469
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,580
I'm doing alright on time.

470
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,280
Maybe I feel like I'm rushing through this.

471
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,300
I think I'm just trying to get the nerves out.

472
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,100
Thank you, thank you.

473
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,610
What does that mean?

474
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,690
Stop the pause.

475
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:45,650
I think I'm sorry.

476
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,130
I feel so much pressure.

477
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,990
OK.

478
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,010
OK, OK.

479
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,770
So this one will be kind of fun to sing maybe.

480
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:38,450
You should wear a warning It's dangerous I'm falling

481
00:45:45,480 --> 00:46:06,020
There's no escape I can't wait I need a hit Baby give me it You're dangerous I love men Too

482
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:22,070
high, can't come down Who's in my head, spinning round and round

483
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:53,810
Now the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under The taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic

484
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:20,930
It's getting late to give you up I took a sip from the devil's cup Slowly, it's taking over me

485
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:44,790
It's in the air, and it's all around Can you feel me now?

486
00:47:44,870 --> 00:48:22,520
The taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under The taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic

487
00:48:26,600 --> 00:49:28,110
The taste of your lips, I'm on a ride You're toxic, I'm slipping under The taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic Intoxicate me now, with your loving mouth I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now Intoxicate me now,

488
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:41,170
with your loving I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic

489
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,890
Which I have another one by them.

490
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:15,950
Apparently they do a lot of songs Thank you guys!

491
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,470
Thank you!

492
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:37,970
Shake it out the nerve, shake it out the nerve I'll do the next one because I don't think I actually got to practice this one at all What do you mean yes?

493
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:39,790
Thank you guys!

494
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:43,230
Thank you for all the superchats!

495
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you Wear your clothes, I'm wearing a dress!

496
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,350
What are you talking about?

497
00:50:52,930 --> 00:51:11,630
Let me do that real quick, I'm just going to have them not pop up, I'm really sorry I do see your notifications, thank you guys so so much, I really appreciate it I just saw one, you guys are so depraved You are so depraved

498
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,710
Entry ticket, no!

499
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,450
It's free!

500
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:22,990
It's free!

501
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,370

It's free!

503
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,730
Yeah, postmodern jukebox.

504
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:46,430
This one also, I saw someone request this one and I was like oh this might be fun Because I was thinking, oh wait I was thinking of this song not too long ago

505
00:51:53,470 --> 00:52:00,030
I didn't practice this at all, so sorry Sorry if it sounds weird.

506
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,970
Let's go!

507
00:52:16,470 --> 00:53:08,350
When the bee stings, when I'm feeling sad I simply remember my favorite things And then I don't feel so bad Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens Bright copper candles and warm woolen mittens Brown paper packages tied up with strings These are a few of my favorite things Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with doodles Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings.

508
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,670
These are a few of my favorite things.

509
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,010
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes.

510
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,770
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes.

511
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:23,810
Silver white winters that melt into springs.

512
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,330
These are a few of my favorite things.

513
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,290
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels.

514
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,010
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles.

515
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,730
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings.

516
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:13,670
These are a few of my favorite things.

517
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,330
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes.

518
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,750
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes.

519
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,550
Silver white winters that melt into springs.

520
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,790
These are a few of my favorite things.

521
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:35,250
When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm feeling sad.

522
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:46,130
I simply remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad.

523
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,740
Sorry, I tripped over my words.

524
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,620
My favorite things.

525
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,600
Postmodern jukebox version.

526
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,140
Actually, I only have a few songs left.

527
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,240
Maybe I should slow down.

528
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,780
Maybe I should slow down.

529
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,300
Well, some of them are like kind of short songs, you know, and some of them are longer.

530
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,820
The next song, I usually don't sing the full version, but maybe we can sing...

531
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,160
Well, it's not singing, it's instrumental.

532
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,380
Never slow down.

533
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,080
And more songs.

534
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,160
I don't know so many.

535
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:47,460
I had to learn a lot of these and I'm still nervous about the few that I have.

536
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,560
I'm still nervous about them.

537
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,600
I'll sing this next song.

538
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,160
Hold on, let me pull it up.

539
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,540
Actually, I don't think this one is on Kara-fun, let me see.

540
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,340
Or maybe it was.

541
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,260
No, it's not.

542
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,200
I have to pull it up.

543
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,390
Ghost in red dresses.

544
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:39,730
I don't think red suits me so much, but I felt like it's such a jazz bar dress, right?

545
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,350
I feel.

546
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:45,810
I had another pink dress that I was going to try wearing instead, but...

547
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,630
It actually showed even more, so...

548
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,730
I was like...

549
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:02,230
I really tried lots of different stuff, but nothing worked on me.

550
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,010
Lots of different outfits.

551
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,470
I wanted to actually wear something really nice.

552
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,170
I was like, I don't know.

553
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,490
I was like...

554
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:16,010
For those who are just like, oh, she keeps talking about new outfits.

555
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:21,550
There is one coming eventually, but it will still be quite some time from now.

556
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,810
So, you know.

557
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,510
I was like...

558
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,010
Maybe in the meantime...

559
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,270
I could try something like this.

560
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:37,370
But it's kind of back...

561
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,790
Not backpedal.

562
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:42,370
What's the word?

563
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,050
It backfired on me.

564
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:50,830
Yeah.

565
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,350
I...

566
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,910
I probably won't do this again.

567
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,350
Hold on, let me check if this is okay.

568
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:07,790
Yeah.

569
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,050
Okay, it seems like to be good.

570
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,510
I might have to turn the volume.

571
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,650
Of course I have to sing this song if we are singing jazz.

572
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:31,470
I actually tried to find an instrumental of the song that plays at the end of Metal Gear Solid 3.

573
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:38,150
When Snake and Eva are having times in the cabin.

574
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:42,270
But there is no instrumental of it anywhere, so I have to commission one.

575
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,370
If I ever...

576
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,150
If I do this again.

577
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,570
Well, I can always sing it whenever.

578
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:50,390
It doesn't have to be a jazzy...

579
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,610
It doesn't have to be a jazzy stream, probably.

580
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:56,250
But...

581
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,110
Yeah, there is no instrumental, right?

582
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:58,850
It sucks.

583
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:04,270
But of course, there is an instrumental of this song from Metal Gear Solid 2.

584
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,410
Let's go.

585
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:10,270
I just realized you can't hear it.

586
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:11,470
There we go.

587
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:50,660
And think, what am I made of?

588
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,240
Am I full of sorrow?

589
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,740
Am I hurt and pained?

590
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:06,060
Or am I filled with love?

591
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:29,300
I walk by myself on the streets below And ask every child I know Do you think tomorrow will bring sun or rain?

592
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,960
Which one of these will show?

593
01:00:37,200 --> 01:01:04,900
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend I keep holding on till the end Out of the darkness, there is no other way Than the light leading to yesterday

594
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:39,740
It's there that I'll find inner peace, not war And dreams that I let slip away I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for Way back in yesterday

595
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:56,280
Why can't each of us in the world ever see the best things in life are free?

596
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:12,480
Little sounds of laughter, a warm hug, a smile, a kiss from you to me.

597
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:21,400
I fall to my knees, I cry and I cry.

598
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,200
Love, do not pass me by.

599
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:37,240
Happy ever after, please stay for a while.

600
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:43,000
Make time, refuse to fly.

601
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:52,420
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend.

602
01:03:53,340 --> 01:04:00,000
Cause I know how good it has been.

603
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:07,960
Facing forever, here I stand, come what may.

604
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:13,860
In the old, in the new, yesterday.

605
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:33,760
It's there that I'll find inner peace, not war and dreams that I let slip away.

606
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:48,900
I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for, way back in yesterday.

607
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,810
Yay, two minute outro.

608
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:07,210
I feel like a Bond villain wearing this.

609
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:12,530
You know, the eyepatch with the dress, I feel like a Bond villain.

610
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,690
Shaken, not stirred.

611
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:21,870
And then

612
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,730
my hammer space, I reach behind my shoulders and I grab it.

613
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,650
Don't female Bond villains all end up naked?

614
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:02,930
I

615
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,220
have one of those.

616
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,770
Too much!

617
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:50,350
No, thank you!

618
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,810
And there's our outro.

619
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:55,430
Yay!

620
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:01,610
No, Mr. Wisp, I expect you to die.

621
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,940
That was...

622
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:14,140
Can't say goodbye to yesterday, which I've sung many, many times on stream, I feel.

623
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,900
One, two, three, four.

624
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,240
I have four songs left.

625
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,600
Four songs left.

626
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:30,990
Your voice has elevated my soul.

627
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,870
I can get rid of this now.

628
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:36,050
Thank you!

629
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:37,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

630
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:41,270
The next couple of songs...

631
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,410
Wait.

632
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,190
All the rest of the songs I've never sung before.

633
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,870
So I'm very nervous.

634
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:49,730
Hydrate?

635
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,550
I have been.

636
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,310
I have some water.

637
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:57,570
Well, I have tea, actually.

638
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:03,970
I'm trying to decide what order I do them in.

639
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:12,570
Can we request more songs?

640
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,950
There's probably so many that I don't know, though, you know?

641
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:21,050
There's probably so many I would probably...

642
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,710
Most of them I'd be like, sorry, I don't know, sorry, I don't know, sorry.

643
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,570
Sorry, I don't know, sorry, I don't know, sorry, I don't know.

644
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,490
Creep is not a jazz song.

645
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,530
Jazz songs only.

646
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:40,290
Actually, I think this next one that I'll do is not entirely jazz.

647
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,310
But I saw someone request it and I was like, oh!

648
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,530
I think this one could be fun to learn.

649
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,410
And surprisingly enough, Kerafun had it.

650
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:49,470
So...

651
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:56,110
I think many people maybe will be surprised by this one.

652
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,850
And also that I'm singing it.

653
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,630
There's a jazz version?

654
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,030
I wish there was a jazz version of Break Stuff.

655
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,110
How does it start?

656
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:14,850
It's just one of those days when you don't want to wake up.

657
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,070
Everybody sucks.

658
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,510
Wait, no.

659
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:19,630
Everything fucks.

660
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,230
Wait, how does it go?

661
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,650
Everybody sucks.

662
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:24,390
Oh, everything sucks.

663
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,610
I can't remember it.

664
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:30,850
I can't remember it.

665
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:33,430
Everybody sucks.

666
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,990
I made up the tune.

667
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:46,930
I feel like the words would just ruin the vibe though.

668
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,870
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

669
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:56,150
Okay.

670
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:56,230
Yeah.

671
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,950
Okay, this next song is from another video game.

672
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,470
Video game.

673
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:05,250
Video game!

674
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:07,490
Okay.

675
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:09,550
Everything fucks.

676
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:16,150
Sorry, I've never played this series so...

677
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,390
You can call me a fake fan for sure.

678
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,670
Well, I'm not claiming to be a fan.

679
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,350
I'm just claiming to sing the song.

680
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,190
And I'll try my best.

681
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:18,050
Where have I been?

682
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:37,770
I'm a shapeshifter I pose masquerade Hiding both face and mind All free for you to draw I'm a shapeshifter What else should I be?

683
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:44,270
Please don't take off my mask Revealing dark

684
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:46,310
Moments of calm Nothing left to be found A mirror right in front of me That's where I find An empty glass Reflecting the sad truth It's telling words not to be told I need the mask I'm a shapeshifter I pose masquerade, hiding both face and mind.

685
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:48,770
All free for you to draw.

686
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:55,590
I'm a shapeshifter, chained down to my core.

687
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:01,970
Please don't take off my mask, my place to hide.

688
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:03,690
Oh,

689
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:34,070
I forgot this part, I'm sorry.

690
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:38,370
I just learned this song today, I'm sorry.

691
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,310
Is that the good sign?

692
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:47,230
Unleash me, I'm burning the walls.

693
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,970
Is there a way for me to break?

694
01:13:54,970 --> 01:14:00,890
I'm a shapeshifter, I pose masquerade.

695
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,030
Hiding both face and mind.

696
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,570
All free for you to draw.

697
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:13,310
I'm a shapeshifter, I have no face to show.

698
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:19,090
Please don't take off my mask, my disguise.

699
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:23,570
I'm sorry.

700
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,030
Sorry.

701
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:18,430
Hold on, I'm gonna go back to that part and listen how it goes.

702
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:22,510
I really learned this one today, so I apologize.

703
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,570
Hold on, I'm going back to that part.

704
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,290
How's it go?

705
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,670
How's this part go?

706
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:35,430
I can't tell you how to see me.

707
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:42,730
Just a cage of bones, there's nothing inside.

708
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:49,390
Unleash me, burning down the walls.

709
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:55,770
Is there a way for me to break?

710
01:15:59,330 --> 01:15:59,770
Shoot.

711
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:02,530
It kind of came to me, your singing is so beautiful.

712
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:03,470
Thank you!

713
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:05,810
Shoot.

714
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:07,630
Shoot, shoot.

715
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:08,090
Oh well.

716
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:12,410
Maybe I will sing this again someday.

717
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:14,050
I'll learn it better.

718
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:19,530
As a Phantom Thief, I'm obligated to say the Persona series is great.

719
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:26,930
Yeah, I borrowed Persona 4 from a friend a long long time ago and I never had a chance to play it.

720
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:32,070
Well, I played a little bit of it, but I never got a chance to finish it.

721
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:36,090
And by play a little bit, I mean like not a lot at all.

722
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:42,670
But I know so many people like P5.

723
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,690
Persona 5!

724
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,870
I didn't mean to say PP!

725
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,430
So, yeah.

726
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,050
Okay, PP.

727
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:06,850
No!

728
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:15,010
No, I was trying to say P5, but then I was like my brain was conflicting with saying P5.

729
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,270
P5 and Persona 5.

730
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:26,830
Oh, my brain.

731
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:30,450
What's wrong with PP?

732
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:34,830
Yeah, no.

733
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,070
Okay.

734
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,030
I still don't feel so relaxed.

735
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:44,490
Why did I say I was going to do this?

736
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,470
Well, so many people seem to like the Santa baby.

737
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:53,670
And I was like, well, maybe a jazz themed karaoke would be kind of fun and it would make me learn a bunch of new songs.

738
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:59,550
But, oh gosh, I feel too anxious.

739
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:05,350
I think I, like I said, it's too much pressure when it's something that is like themed like this.

740
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:12,650
So, unless it's, I don't know, it's just so much pressure.

741
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,530
I'm creating my own pressure.

742
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:17,550
No pressure.

743
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,310
For singing one of my favorite Persona songs, I must kneel.

744
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:28,690
Well, you can thank the membu who wrote it on the suggestion post.

745
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:37,390
Yeah, so, and of course, you know, for future streams, I mean, I always, people are always sending me suggestions anyway.

746
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:45,770
But maybe, maybe for the, if I do another jazz karaoke, I can do more of the people's suggestions.

747
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:51,250
There were some, I had my, my initial set list was 20 songs, like usually, like I usually have.

748
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:57,050
And I had to cut it down a whole bunch because I couldn't learn enough songs in time.

749
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,410
So I apologize.

750
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:03,890
Jazz Revengeance, maybe.

751
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,350
Maybe, maybe.

752
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,230
Yes, yes, yes.

753
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:14,250
Last three, I'm still nervous about, I'm so nervous.

754
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:16,470
Okay, I'm going to do this next one.

755
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,550
Can you hear me typing?

756
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:29,230
This one I have to, hold on.

757
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,290
Okay, okay.

758
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:32,430
I remember how it goes, I think.

759
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:35,310
I think, oh, I don't know.

760
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:36,010
We'll see.

761
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:38,210
Hold on, let me hear the, let me hear the first key.

762
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

763
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:45,630
Okay.

764
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,630
Still impressed you learned so much in such a short time.

765
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:54,390
Jazz is hard, but you're blowing it out of the water.

766
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:55,470
Thank you.

767
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:56,750
Okie dokie.

768
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,330
Okay.

769
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,030
I like the song a lot, actually.

770
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,470
From when I was learning it, I was like, this song is so cute.

771
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:05,250
Okay.

772
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:35,330
These foolish things remind me of you.

773
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:42,590
A tinkling piano in the next apartment.

774
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:49,550
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant.

775
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:54,170
A fairgrounds painted swings.

776
01:20:54,690 --> 01:21:00,770
These foolish things remind me of you.

777
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:13,650
You came, you saw, you conquered me.

778
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:27,130
When you did that to me, I knew somehow this had to be.

779
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:32,670
The winds of March that made my heart a dancer.

780
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:39,080
The telephone that rings, but who was phoned?

781
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,160
Oh, how the ghost of you clings.

782
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:51,100
These foolish things remind me of you.

783
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,640
First daffodils and long excited cables.

784
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:04,040
And candle lights on little corner tables.

785
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,560
And still my heart has wings.

786
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:16,320
These foolish things remind me of you.

787
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:22,800
The park at evening when the bell has sounded.

788
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,620
The Ile de France with all the girls around it.

789
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:34,760
The beauty that is spring.

790
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:40,740
These foolish things remind me of you.

791
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:53,280
How strange, how sweet to find you still.

792
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:59,640
These things are dear to me.

793
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:06,520
They seem to bring you near to me.

794
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:12,360
The sigh of midnight trains and empty stations.

795
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,920
Silk stockings thrown aside, dance invitations.

796
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:25,040
Oh, how the ghost of you clings.

797
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:30,440
These foolish things remind me of you.

798
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:38,920
Oh, these foolish things remind me of...

799
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,410
Yay!

800
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,910
I forgot a little bit of the middle there, sorry.

801
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,910
These foolish things...

802
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:03,690
Yay!

803
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:07,330
How the ghost of you clings!

804
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:08,290
I'm the ghost.

805
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,330
And I'm clinging to your life force.

806
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:14,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

807
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:17,450
Such a cute song though, right?

808
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:20,910
Okay!

809
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:21,230
Yay!

810
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:32,350
Just karaoke but no bebop cowboy?

811
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,490
I couldn't remember enough.

812
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:38,690
I only know the ending.

813
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:39,370
Like what?

814
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,010
Like the real folk blues?

815
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:42,850
Lots of blues.

816
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:46,970
Right!

817
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,510
It still counts?

818
01:24:58,610 --> 01:24:59,190
Does it?

819
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:03,790
I don't remember enough of the song I think.

820
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:07,510
I think I only know the ending version.

821
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:09,610
I don't know the middle version of it.

822
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:13,490
Tank is jazz?

823
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:15,250
Tank has like...

824
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:18,370
Hey everybody, let's get this party started.

825
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,090
It's time to play the song Tank.

826
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,480
I wonder if they have it on here.

827
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,640
Oh wait, I think... No, they do not.

828
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,000
That would be crazy though.

829
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,880
They do have the real folk blues on here which I also thought was...

830
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,460
Which I also thought was really crazy.

831
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:55,100
Someone did request it and I like tried...

832
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,080
Oh no, wait!

833
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,660
They have a TV size!

834
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:33,280
Amari ni mo toki wa sugitte shimatta Mada kokoro no kokorobi wo Iyasenu mama kaze ga fuite

835
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:42,460
Kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure

836
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,880
Oh, I cut out so abruptly.

837
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,140
I didn't even finish drinking my tea.

838
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,640
Yay, impromptu, the real folk blues.

839
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:57,020
Now, I only sang that one because I initially had it on my set list, but I took it out because I was like, I don't know the full version and I don't have time to learn it.

840
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,860
And it's technically not really jazzy.

841
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,840
I mean, well, it's jazzy, but you know what I mean.

842
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:03,880
It works.

843
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,180
Probably.

844
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,380
How do I want to do this next song?

845
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,340
I had something that I wanted to do for this next song.

846
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:27,040
The version that I learned from I Don't Feel is very jazzy, even though it's a jazzy song, but I felt all jazzy songs or versions of this song were...

847
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:30,340
Were...

848
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,300
City of Space Minto.

849
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,840
Were in French.

850
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:45,180
And I think I might have practiced this song the most today because I was like, I don't know French.

851
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,320
I don't know French.

852
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:50,860
I do not know.

853
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,480
So, oh gosh.

854
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,520
But I really tried to try singing French.

855
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,000
I don't know.

856
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:12,020
I'm going to pronounce things wrong and you guys will be like, oh, no, no, no.

857
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:12,600
And...

858
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:24,100
And what's worse is I took three years of French and my last name is French.

859
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,220
Phantom!

860
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,260
But I don't know.

861
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,800
I don't know at all.

862
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:38,060
All I remember how to say in French is c'est dégoûtant, which is disgusting.

863
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,380
And ça va?

864
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,020
Oui, ça va.

865
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:51,200
And qu'est-ce que c'est?

866
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,540
And omelette de fromage.

867
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:10,510
I know that one too.

868
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:12,570
Thank you Metal Gear.

869
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:14,410
Thank you Metal Gear.

870
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,620
It's not mint fantomy.

871
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,000
Mint fantomy.

872
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,520
Oh, Les Miserables.

873
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:31,880
I

874
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,960
don't think I can do the whole... I didn't also really learn the beginning of the song.

875
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,160
Je t'aime.

876
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:52,800
Oui.

877
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,360
Non, non, non, non.

878
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:58,540
Non, je t'aime.

879
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,380
Non, non, non.

880
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:03,980
Non, non.

881
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,180
Do it for practice.

882
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:15,120
If it sounds so bad, I will unarchive this.

883
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,800
I'm too embarrassed.

884
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,200
Non,

885
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,900
non, non, non, non.

886
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,320
Please, no.

887
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,040
Ah, oh.

888
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,260
Okay.

889
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:47,410
Maybe I'll just do my... Hold on, let me listen to the beginning of this.

890
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:50,230
Sorry, let me listen to the beginning of this version.

891
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:55,610
Because this one I really like because it's so jazzy, but...

892
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,460
Oh, I can't do this.

893
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:10,730
I'm gonna... I feel like I'm gonna be sounding like I'm making a mockery.

894
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,650
There's an English version.

895
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:15,670
Yeah, I know.

896
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,630
I had another English version too.

897
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:24,870
It just didn't sound... The Louis Armstrong version is too much instrumental.

898
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:25,950
I had another one.

899
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:30,210
But the other one that I had didn't sound so jazzy.

900
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:34,910
So I was like, okay, maybe I can try the Lady Gaga one.

901
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:37,970
Because I didn't know that she sang it.

902
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,350
I've never seen A Star is Born, but she apparently sang it in that.

903
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:43,330
The Frenchies can take it.

904
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:44,850
Don't speak for them!

905
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,830
I'm so sorry.

906
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:55,230
I had this in the middle of my setlist and I kept pushing it off and off and off and off.

907
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:01,170
I kept pushing it off and off and off and off.

908
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:04,610
Because I was like, I'm too nervous to sing it yet.

909
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:06,730
Oh, yeah.

910
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,410
Okay, don't make fun of me.

911
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:12,030
Okay, guys, or I'll never sing again.

912
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,350
I'll never sing again.

913
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:16,830
You'll never see me.

914
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:18,950
You'll never see me alive.

915
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:19,730
Because you know what?

916
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,870
Because I'm not alive.

917
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:26,070
I think Tia will give you a pass.

918
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:27,230
Okay.

919
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:29,970
Maybe.

920
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:36,130
Anybody who's French, I'm trying.

921
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:37,730
Oh, God, I feel like I'm about to cry.

922
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:38,930
Oh, God.

923
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,510
I'm not strong enough.

924
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,500
I cry when I'm embarrassed.

925
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:53,980
Sorry.

926
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:56,680
Okay.

927
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,400
Okay, the French are kind people.

928
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,200
Maybe I'll just do... You know what?

929
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:09,860
Let me sing the English version.

930
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,940
English version first.

931
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:11,580
Is that okay?

932
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,000
I'm going to try the English version.

933
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,600
Sorry that this one isn't as jazzy sounding.

934
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:21,040
I apologize.

935
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:32,870
Oh, wait.

936
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:33,370
Oh, wait.

937
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:39,270
I need to change the key.

938
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:41,070
Yes, I do.

939
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:42,390
Good thing I checked.

940
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:47,710
Sorry, I'm checking everything real quick.

941
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:49,030
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

942
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:53,190
Okay.

943
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:56,170
Okay, okay.

944
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,290
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

945
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:04,210
Okay.

946
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:22,340
Okay.

947
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,000
This is

948
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:46,320
When you kiss me heaven's eyes, and though I close my eyes, I see love in a rose.

949
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:57,080
When you press your heart, I'm in a world apart.

950
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,100
A world where roses bloom.

951
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,080
And when you speak, angels sing from above.

952
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:21,700
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs.

953
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:37,360
Give your heart and soul to me, and life will always be love in a rose.

954
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:54,180
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs.

955
01:36:55,220 --> 01:37:13,660
Give your heart and soul to me, and life will always be love in a rose.

956
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,520
Sorry, I chickened out.

957
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,140
I chickened out.

958
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,800
I was like, okay, I'm gonna sing here.

959
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:42,140
Maybe if I sing along with Lady Gaga, I'll feel better.

960
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:46,080
Let me sing with Lady Gaga.

961
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,040
Lady Gaga, help me.

962
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,360
Help me, Lady Gaga.

963
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,460
Help me, Lady Gaga.

964
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,280
Help me.

965
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,140
Help me.

966
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,120
Help me, Lady.

967
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:49,680
Oh There are some things that make me feel good But nothing comes out of my mouth Here are the words that touch me From my heart, I'm going to tell you When you take me in your arms I'm going to fall down I see life in a rose He tells me words of me Words of everyday And it makes me feel good

968
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,240
Oh, the timing!

969
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:02,300
What is this pacing?

970
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,620
Why did she say, would anybody like some French tips tonight?

971
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:47,040
I don't get it.

972
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:53,910
Sorry, I forgot the last part.

973
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:55,750
I tried, okay?

974
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:57,250
Now you can't say that I didn't try.

975
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,930
Now you can't say that I didn't try!

976
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:01,970
Thank you Lady Gaga for back up vocals.

977
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:08,890
I called in a favor for her.

978
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:10,690
I was like, Lady Gaga, please.

979
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:15,170
Lady Gaga, you know how you owe me.

980
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:18,090
She was just returning the favor, right?

981
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:20,330
J'adore.

982
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:21,850
Merci.

983
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:22,990
Merci beaucoup.

984
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:25,170
C'est magnifique.

985
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:25,930
Merci.

986
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,470
Merci beaucoup.

987
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:31,050
Merci, merci, merci beaucoup.

988
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:31,970
Yay!

989
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:43,090
Alright guys, it's time for my finale song.

990
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,190
Which isn't, I guess, maybe so much great.

991
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:50,030
In fact, I don't know why I kept this one as the finale song.

992
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:55,390
Because the karaoke version that I have of it is not very good at all.

993
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,250
It's not very good at all.

994
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,190
Maybe we'll do Snake Eater as the finale finale.

995
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:07,810
Okay, I'll sing this song and then we'll sing Snake Eater.

996
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:14,310
Since I feel that maybe the karaoke that I have of this kind of sucks.

997
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:16,710
Because there was no karaoke that I could find anywhere.

998
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:20,230
Sounds French to me.

999
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:21,170
Greetings from Germany.

1000
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:23,030
Thank you.

1001
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:25,970
Jazzy Snake Eater.

1002
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:27,850
I don't know if there is.

1003
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:28,850
Oh wait, there is.

1004
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:32,890
There is a jazz version of Snake Eater, but I don't think it has an instrumental.

1005
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:35,330
Okay, hold on.

1006
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:37,610
I have to remember how this song goes.

1007
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:52,870
I apologize in advance for the karaoke quality of this song, but I really did want to sing it regardless.

1008
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:55,150
I apologize.

1009
01:42:55,150 --> 01:42:56,870
I apologize.

1010
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:58,170
I apologize.

1011
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:01,150
Okay.

1012
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:05,230
Happy birthday!

1013
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,590
Is that a real birthday?

1014
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:16,360
I think this one is also from Fallout.

1015
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:26,900
Holy loud, I'm so sorry.

1016
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,080
My goodness gracious.

1017
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:30,680
Okay, what were we doing?

1018
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:31,660
Sorry, so sorry.

1019
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,440
My ears.

1020
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:15,910
Take me, make me forget my sorrow.

1021
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:27,370
So when I wake tomorrow, I'll know our love was right.

1022
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:35,830
Kiss me as though it were now or never.

1023
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:46,240
Teach me all that a heart should know.

1024
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:55,600
Love me as though there were no tomorrow.

1025
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,740
Don't ever let me go.

1026
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:35,680
As though there were no tomorrow.

1027
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,080
Love me.

1028
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:55,020
Don't ever let me go.

1029
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:59,160
Don't ever let me go.

1030
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:19,510
Love me as though there was no tomorrow.

1031
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:22,190
Such a pretty song.

1032
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:23,010
Such a pretty song.

1033
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:23,650
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

1034
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:32,010
Okay, I guess we finish with... Yay!

1035
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:34,690
Thank you for the jazzy vibes!

1036
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:37,330
Thank you!

1037
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,830
Hold on, I think it's this one.

1038
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:43,590
Let me double check.

1039
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:44,850
Let me also make sure.

1040
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:52,730
Hold on.

1041
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:57,550
I think this is okay.

1042
01:46:58,170 --> 01:46:59,090
I think this works.

1043
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:00,110
I think this is good.

1044
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:06,950
Okay, so I did say what a thrill, so... Sneeter time!

1045
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:08,750
Oh, don't forget the eyepatch!

1046
01:47:08,810 --> 01:47:09,330
So true!

1047
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:12,590
So true, so true, so true, so true, so true.

1048
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:13,850
Okay, okay.

1049
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:15,410
Alrighty, alrighty.

1050
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:20,810
Let's go.

1051
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:30,940
What

1052
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,800
a thrill.

1053
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:46,160
With darkness and silence through the night.

1054
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,780
What a thrill.

1055
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:56,400
I'm searching and I'm melting to you.

1056
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:02,540
What a fear in my heart.

1057
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,140
But you're so supreme.

1058
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,680
I'd give my life for

1059
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,920
you.

1060
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:29,240
In my time, there'll be no one else.

1061
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:39,960
It's the way I fly to you.

1062
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:49,420
I'm still in a dream, sneaking up.

1063
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:56,880
Someday you'll go through the rain.

1064
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:01,840
Someday you'll feed on a tree frog.

1065
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:07,140
This ordeal, the trial to survive.

1066
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:13,420
For the day we see new light.

1067
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:22,100
I'd give my life, not for honor, but for you.

1068
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:34,700
In my time, there'll be no one else.

1069
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:44,700
Crime, it's the way I fly to you.

1070
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:55,660
I'm still in a dream, sneaking up.

1071
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:10,260
I'm still in a dream, sneaking up.

1072
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:16,420
Sneaking up.

1073
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:25,320
I'll show you guys my dress off one last time.

1074
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:27,520
Say goodbye to the dress, say goodbye to the dress.

1075
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,000
I'm teeny tiny.

1076
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:38,240
I hope you guys liked the karaoke.

1077
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:44,780
Thanks for jazzy jazz fun time.

1078
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,320
See you guys later.

1079
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,240
Otsumindo.

1080
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,860
Bye JPEG dress.

1081
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,860
Yeah, bye JPEG dress.

1082
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:54,460
Bye bye.

1083
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:55,340
Otsumindo.

1084
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,280
Thank you.

1085
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,740
Thank you, thank you.

1086
01:50:58,460 --> 01:50:58,660
Thank

1087
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,640
you guys, thank you.
