1
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,880
It still sounds like...

2
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,880
That royal song.

3
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,780
Never be royal.

4
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,690
It can never be royal.

5
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,850
You still don't hear it here.

6
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,290
Hold on.

7
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,450
It's the same part.

8
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,430
It's the same.

9
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,970
It does!

10
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,890
It just sounds like it.

11
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,240
I hear it every time!

12
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,680
Amito, hello!

13
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
Stinko!

14
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,620
No!

15
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,640
Wait?

16
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,380
No!

17
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,600
You hear it now?

18
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,280
You just have to add that part afterwards.

19
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,340
It's literally the three notes.

20
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,220
That's that.

21
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh my god, I almost said smells like Royals.

22
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
Sounds like Roy.

23
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
How's your gotcha pull lately?

24
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,400
Bad!

25
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,820
Just popped in to say hi.

26
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,140
Hello!

27
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,580
Thank you!

28
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,060
13 months already!

29
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,540
Oh my gosh, thank you!

30
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:37,340
I did a pull this morning in Blue Archive because even if If there's a new banner and it's not unique in Blue Archive, I'll still pull.

31
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,500
Unique meaning a character that is like, can only be pulled during the banner and can't be pulled any time else, you know?

32
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,440
Nakizo, thank you so much for the fun!

33
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,880
Good time!

34
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,340
But thank you so much for seven buttons.

35
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,080
Thank you.

36
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,220
And...

37
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,160
You heard it, right?

38
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
I can't unhear it.

39
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,980
Find the Tokyo next week.

40
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,880
First time to Japan, I heard this cafe was a good place to get some directions.

41
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,920
Any Minto musties.

42
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,600
We'd love to hear from fellow wisps as well.

43
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,820
Azure, I hope you have so much fun.

44
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,720
Must Sees.

45
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,500
Tears stay.

46
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,240
It's so true!

47
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,700
I watched the Akiba Tour stream.

48
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,660
Good luck with gotcha pulls.

50
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Thank you!

51
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,680
Fight size!

52
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,580
Thank you so much for the 20 gift!

53
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,820
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

54
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,220
Ah,

55
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,900
I'm trying to think of a place.

56
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,700
Garbo Lemon!

57
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,880
Thank you so much for the 20 gift!

58
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you guys, thank you!

59
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Lehman, friend, don't dash me.

60
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Can ghost swim?

61
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,820
Float.

62
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
My size, I use it for another five, thank you.

63
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,800
With your negligence, you'll make more ghoul friends.

64
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,980
Okay, but imagine, imagine this, water park, it's haunted.

65
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,900
We advertise it as such, instant attraction.

66
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:37,350
There are many people that will go stay out of place because it's haunted, yeah, park's haunted.

67
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,230
Ducky, thanks a lot, my goodness!

68
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,030
Mm-hmm.

69
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,750
Mm-hmm.

70
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,930
What in the Scooby-Doo?

71
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:59,470
Even our, the slides, like how it's Scooby-Doo when you open a door, you know the chase scenes where they like crisscross and everything?

72
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,490
That's what our tubes do too.

73
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,770
Olaf Pilgrim- I swear he moved.

74
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,510
No, he's been in the same place.

75
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,270
Same spot for like ever, ever, ever.

76
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,930
Jesse, thank you so much for the podcast.

77
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,270
Thank you.

78
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,090
Been listening to the podcast.

79
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,590
Any chance of a season two of your own spooky story time.

80
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,910
I don't have anything to say.

81
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,390
Spooky.

82
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,630
I caused the spooky.

83
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,850
Bless the kicks.

84
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,130
Welcome to Mambuship the Haku.

85
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,910
Yeah, podcast is over one year old.

86
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,750
When can babies talk?

87
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,150
Can the podcast speak?

88
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,130
Do you want a golden beach ball?

89
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,050
Just want a top of Kmart.

90
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,090
So if you climb the tree beside it...

91
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,410
Wait, really?

92
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,190
Wait.

93
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,390
Santa Parland.

94
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,290
On top of the Kmart?

95
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,550
Wait, hopefully it doesn't do that thing where it like explodes.

96
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,910
It did the thing where it exploded.

97
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,550
One moment?

98
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,030
One moment?

99
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,710
Oh, not controls.

100
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,390
What am I doing?

101
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:13,990
Settings?

102
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,710
I don't know why it does this every time.

103
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,790
Hold on.

104
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,230
I probably have to just like...

105
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,770
There we go.

106
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,110
Okay.

107
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,440
Here?

108
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:41,390
Uh-oh.

109
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,690
I can't move anymore.

110
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,630
Uh-oh.

111
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,990
Wait.

112
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,190
Wait.

113
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,710
I can't move.

114
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,830
Okay, we can move.

115
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:48,430
Okay.

116
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,810
Wait, the stairs don't work.

117
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,660
Wait,

118
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,260
wait, I'm stuck.

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,400
Guys, now I'm actually stuck.

120
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,160
Somebody help me, please!

121
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,440
Somebody!

122
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,000
Somebody help!

123
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,520
There's someone stuck up here!

124
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,280
Somebody!

125
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
Somebody help!

126
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,900
Help me!

127
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,220
Help me, please!

128
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,820
Help me, please!

129
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,720
Help!

130
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
Look up!

131
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,140
Gamers don't look up!

132
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,260
Oh no!

133
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,640
Guys!

134
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,800
Guys!

135
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,440
Guys, I can't stop!

136
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,400
Respawn.

137
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,500
Okay, we're fine.

138
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,160
Thank you.

139
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,760
I didn't know that that button existed.

140
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,660
Okay, hold on.

141
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
How do you climb up top the game board?

142
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,860
It's my birthday today!

143
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,400
Love it!

144
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,980
Happy birthday!

145
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,920
Start by 21st off strong.

146
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,580
You can have everything you want now!

147
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,080
Yeah!

148
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960
I say...

149
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,680
You could hire some lovely ladies...

150
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,500
For a party.

151
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,880
Unless you know some.

152
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,920
Okay, hold on.

153
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,240
How do you climb?

154
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,700
Maybe the tree.

155
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,380
Okay.

156
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,380
What did I say?

157
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,890
You can't do that.

158
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,170
Wait, what did I say?

159
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,790
Tree is key.

160
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,510
Okay, cool.

161
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,630
Like clowns?

162
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,230
Yeah!

163
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,070
Or...

164
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,030
I was thinking...

165
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,390
Oh.

166
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,670
I was thinking like...

167
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,910
Like a...

168
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,450
dancer who could do tricks at your parties.

169
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,050
Clowns are always good for parties.

170
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,990
Wait, can I go higher in the tree?

171
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,420
I want to go to Maid's cafe during my birthday and then they'll sing me happy birthday.

172
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
Oh gosh, I had it.

173
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,940
I was so close before.

174
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,500
Maybe.

175
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,540
Maybe I jump to this window.

176
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,120
Okay, okay.

177
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,540
Ah!

178
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,960
Okay, hold on.

180
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,660
Okay.

181
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,320
Don't you want to get soaked?

182
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,040
Oop.

183
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,020
Don't you want to get soaked before you go into work?

184
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,820
Screw work.

185
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,840
Come get soaked at my park.

186
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,160
Baby Corrie, thanks for the vibe, Getson.

187
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,200
Stay great.

188
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,860
Thanks very much.

189
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,220
Yes.

190
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:32,840
You do?

191
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:33,980
Yeah.

192
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
The 360 next door.

193
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
He was like the audacity.

194
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,960
Help!

195
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,220
What am I doing wrong?

196
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,700
Team!

197
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,700
Team, what am I doing wrong?

198
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,540
Stick to the wall.

199
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,020
Try.

200
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,780
Go diagonal.

201
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,940
According to you, a servant...

202
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,700
Wait, hold on.

203
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, I forgot to do something.

204
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,280
Happy churno day.

205
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,060
Oh my gosh, it is churno day.

206
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,260
9-9.

207
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,140
Where did the U.S.

208
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,740
Survey 9?

209
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,240
Oh, 9.

210
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,080
September 9th is statistically most common birthday in the U.S.

211
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,880
So happy birthday to all the wisps today.

212
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,440
Not me, I'm in March.

213
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,160
Really?

214
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,400
I guess it's because so many New Year's babies.

215
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,080
Maybe.

216
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,920
Makes sense, I suppose.

217
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,760
People know how to party.

218
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,360
You too can party at your birthday with the ladies.

219
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,480
Who's laughing?

220
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,240
You?

221
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,440
They're trying- they're laughing at me for attempting this.

222
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,680
I want to see- wait, is it there?

223
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
It must be.

224
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,100
Hug the wall.

225
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,320
Oh!

226
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,540
Double jump?

227
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,040
Oh, I have the tree branch!

228
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,080
Okay, okay.

229
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Do

230
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,880
you imagine if there was fall damage in this game?

231
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,860
Oh, oh!

232
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,580
Every new year you can think I was conceived.

233
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,820
No, I don't want to think that.

234
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,740
Why would somebody want to think that?

235
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,480
Oh, yeah.

236
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,820
Hello from France.

237
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,480
Hello!

238
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,920
Hello!

239
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,040
How's it going?

240
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,280
Yes, it's going.

241
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,420
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

242
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,940
Uh, I'm called Mimpo.

243
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,440
Uh...

244
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,720
Uh...

245
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,130
It's all good.

246
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,310
Ah...

247
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,710
Yeah.

248
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,470
Uh...

249
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,030
I'm Napoleon.

250
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,190
No, I'm...

251
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,850
I'm...

252
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,390
Wait.

253
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,350
I'm...

254
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,830
Minto.

255
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,630
Maybe they should have soapy water pistol fights at anime conventions.

256
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,090
There are like conventions in the States that are...

257
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,350
There's one that takes place at a water park.

258
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,530
And I've kind of always wanted to go.

259
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,530
Oh!

260
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,450
Oh!

261
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,110
Oh!

262
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,630
Oh!

263
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,210
I'm feeling the monkey in me.

264
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,950
I'm climbing this tree!

265
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,230
Who worked?

266
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,210
Oh, Braylon over there is probably like, what are we gonna open?

267
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,710
And the monkey!

268
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,850
Wait, how old do I go from here though?

269
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,970
This branch maybe?

270
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,650
We lost it all, but we can get this back.

271
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,190
I believe, trust, trust!

272
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,770
in the pixie dust.

273
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,510
Okay.

274
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,930
Alright, we got it back.

275
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,330
I just, these limbs look too thin for me to climb atop of.

276
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,310
But I guess I'm doing it.

277
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,350
I'm not doing it.

278
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,890
I was at that con.

279
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,890
It was a blast.

280
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,950
It looks so fun.

281
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,480
Yeah.

282
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
There's an easier way.

283
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,420
Okay, tell me the easiest way.

284
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,480
This way doesn't work.

285
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,700
I don't think.

286
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,620
I can't go here.

287
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,560
Who's in the sewers?

288
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,100
You see that?

289
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,960
There's like something sticking out of there.

290
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,100
Roof, lamp post, lamp post, building roof.

291
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,860
Water.

292
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,200
So like real parkour.

293
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,170
Lamp post.

294
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,450
Lamp post.

295
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,630
But...

296
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,750
Lamp posts apparently.

297
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,370
Ah, the left one.

298
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,970
Yeah, because I was gonna say there's no second lamp post.

299
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,390
Up there?

300
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,330
Or up here?

301
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,950
Hmm.

302
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,130
Mysterious, okay.

303
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,190
Okay, okay.

304
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,110
Alright.

305
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,430
My park is so pretty.

306
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,750
Oh my gosh.

307
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,030
Okay.

308
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,770
Gaming?

309
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:29,630
We're gaming?

310
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,330
We're gamers?

311
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,840
Okay.

312
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,980
Dexpo was so fun!

313
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,800
We gotta greet Minto meat again.

314
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,460
What?

315
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,720
You greeted me again?

316
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,100
Okay, gamers.

317
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,440
Ah!

318
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,760
My depth perception strikes again.

319
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,020
It's okay.

320
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,180
Oh, that's fine.

321
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,100
We're okay.

322
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,040
Get up, buddy.

323
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,660
Gosh, we're so tan.

324
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,620
We're like super tan.

325
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,580
We're crazy.

326
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,120
Okay.

327
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
How was your water park?

328
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,540
My water park is amazing.

329
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,000
We've only had several deaths.

330
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,240
So, okay, wait.

331
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,380
From lamp post, how do we go?

332
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,310
Only several.

333
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,090
Tan minto.

334
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,870
I don't know if ghosts can tan.

335
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,630
On top of the stairs.

336
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,330
Oh, we're gaming.

337
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,650
We got it!

338
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,010
We got it!

339
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,970
Oh my gosh!

340
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,910
We got it!

341
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,630
We got it!

342
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,930
I wasn't one guide either.

343
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,610
It's real.

344
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,710
Yippee!

345
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,350
Can I take this stuff too?

346
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:11,970
Mine?

347
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,090
Whose house is this anyway?

348
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,490
I'm breaking in.

349
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,630
Breaking and entering?

350
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,150
Yes!

351
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,730
Yes!

352
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,250
The golden balls!

353
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,210
Balls!

354
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,630
Singular.

355
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,770
Is that trash in my... Wait.

356
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,150
Why do I have trash in my thing already?

357
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,330
Did I not clean up last stream?

358
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,450
No bad.

359
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,950
Trash!

360
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:52,490
Oh, I think I ate that trash?

361
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,810
Wait, seriously, where did it go?

362
00:22:59,420 --> 00:22:59,980
Kintama!

363
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,840
We ate it.

364
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,680
How efficient is that?

365
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,420
We don't waste anything here.

366
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,520
We go.

367
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,340
That can be part of our advertising.

368
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,400
We're a totally clean and awesome park.

369
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,400
Okay, so to get to three stars, oh, let me move you guys over just a tad so that you can see our goals.

370
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,970
Like so.

371
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,730
There you go.

372
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,330
So our goal currently is two.

373
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,950
Push out cheaters!

374
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,510
Pumpkin eaters!

375
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,560
Okay, seems clean.

376
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,560
How about you?

377
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,380
Clean?

378
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,240
Yep.

379
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,300
Clean and fixed.

380
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,760
Clean and fixed.

381
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,100
Clean and... Oh, fixed.

382
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,720
That's right.

383
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,820
A little palm tree.

384
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Oh.

385
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,670
The final cosplay of Expo.

386
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,450
Yeah, I know it's you!

387
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,670
Whoa!

388
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,770
W's a Chino dono.

389
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,190
Thank you!

390
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,050
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

391
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,150
Self-love is important.

392
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:19,850
So true.

393
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,870
Everybody have this sort of confidence, you know?

394
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,250
Okay.

395
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,330
Alright.

396
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:28,770
I

397
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,430
didn't do anything last year.

398
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,250
Oh yeah, I think I ended in a rush, that's why.

399
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,490
I was like, uh-oh.

400
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,710
But today, no rush.

401
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,010
What about self-loading?

402
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:59,170
If you self-load yourself, I'll be enough to love the both of us.

403
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:12,970
Or, wait, I'll love everybody enough where if you load yourself, I love you enough.

404
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,570
What am I saying anymore?

405
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,790
Don't question mark.

406
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,150
I don't get it, but she loves us.

407
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,050
Oh, I'm just...

408
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,330
We should do some...

409
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,670
Okay, we have $1,000 to blow, baby.

410
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,390
But not on blow.

411
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,270
We're gonna blow it on paint.

412
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,510
Yeah!

413
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:48,830
Can I get a year?

414
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,170
Yeah!

415
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,630
Okay, paint is here.

416
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,850
We're gonna start making this area looks kinda...

417
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,930
Research floor tool.

418
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,550
Oh, never mind, just kidding.

419
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,950
It looks like...

420
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,070
It looks... Actually, you know what?

421
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,350
It's rustic.

422
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,170
It's themed after...

423
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,600
Something.

424
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,680
What can I get?

425
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,460
Oh, I have four.

426
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,140
Let's see.

427
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,940
Increased walk speed.

428
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,060
Do you think visitor patients would increase them dying as well?

429
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,840
Like, I mean, like they would not die as well.

430
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,460
Let's get attractions level one.

431
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,420
Oh, a jukebox.

432
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,500
Oh, here's the floor tool.

433
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,620
I can't afford it.

434
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,540
No!

435
00:26:50,420 --> 00:27:05,940

437
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,840

I think we can open the park.

443
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,870
Oh, more trash.

444
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,630
How'd that get there?

445
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,870
Durability management is nice.

446
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,430

447
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,830
Could I unlock that one?

448
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,410
I don't know.

449
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,110
Uh...

450
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,970

451
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,110

00:27:59,410 --> 00:27:59,850

459
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,420
Okay, we could start the park now.

460
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,520

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,880
Is it just the flower beds and stuff?

472
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
You should put four next to each other just to spite that nerd.

473
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,460
If you're watching right now, don't worry.

474
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,860
Wait, what else did I build?

475
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,380
Oh no, I didn't build anything else.

476
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,100
But this is important to have.

477
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,420
And we'll put it straight in the middle so that I can always get a life ring.

478
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,340
Oh.

479
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,740

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,040
I'm a failure of a park owner.

564
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,310
Seems like a tundere.

565
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,950
Okay.

566
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,450
Nah, I don't think he wants to be the joy.

567
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,320
Lemonade and ice.

568
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,000
Got it.

569
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:23,800
Oh.

570
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,160
There you go.

571
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,020
Trash.

572
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,160
I have a trash can right here.

573
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,880
Meet the ground.

574
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,760
No, no, no.

575
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,320
I have dogs.

576
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:36,840
I have dogs.

577
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,320
I have dogs.

578
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,140
Okay, we have dogs.

579
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,660
We have dogs.

580
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,840
Add both.

581
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,580
Okay.

582
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,980
Get out of here.

583
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,540
Scram.

584
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,500
Scream!

585
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,400
Lemonade.

586
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:51,950
Dojo.

587
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,250
Add both.

588
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,710
Patty, thank you so much for the thank you!

589
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:00,970
Lemonade.

590
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,690
Add ice.

591
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,070
Dojo.

592
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,550
Add ketchup.

593
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,650
Dojo.

594
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,450
Add ketchup.

595
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:10,890
Lemonade.

596
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,290
Dojo.

597
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,410
Send the hot dog sound.

598
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:17,830
Send the hot dog sound.

599
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:17,890
No!

600
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,170
Are there any evil people about?

601
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,790
No one's drowning.

602
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,330
Everyone's having a good time.

603
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,150
Oh, trash.

604
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,750
Stinky trash.

605
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,570
You want a hot dog?

606
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,070
My last one.

607
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,750
Add both.

608
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,230
Any evil people?

609
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:41,870
Oh.

610
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,770
Uh-oh, stinky.

611
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,090
Don't walk here.

612
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,700
Sometimes I can't.

613
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,000
Sometimes I can't tell the balls from the trash.

614
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,800
Oh, oops.

615
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,320
Look in a mirror to find the evil people.

616
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,000
Hey!

617
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,230
Evil ghost.

618
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,690
So true.

619
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,050
Well, it's broken.

620
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:22,890
This one?

621
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,490
This one?

622
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,430
How did it get disrepair so fast?

623
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,090
is tired.

624
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:31,730
Oh my gosh.

625
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,090
Wait.

626
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:32,970
No, please.

627
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,290
Don't.

628
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,090
Braylon, leave.

629
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:34,930
Don't leave me.

Braylon, I need you.

633
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,230
I need you to fly the plane.

634
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:41,730
Hello.

635
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,950

Slide pass.

637
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,090
Of course.

Hot dogs.

00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,570
Someone's drowning?

641
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,990
Uh, I only have five pockets.

642
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,280
Don't drown.

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,100
Ooh, someone else is drowning?

651
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,440

And $10,000 of revenue.

661
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,100

Oh, my bad.

00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,270
Hot dog.

679
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,130
Add ketchup.

680
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,330
Such an intense game.

681
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,010
I know.

682
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,370
For no reason.

683
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,450
For no reason, it's so intense.

684
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,040
Oh, are there...

685
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,400

Oh, uh-oh.

00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,980
I think we lost one.

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,840
Oh, no, we did.

689
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:03,800
Oops.

I'm so sorry.

697
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,290
Getting crazy with the throws.

Oh, yeah, baby.

699
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,950
How do you drown at the edge?

700
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,190
They just are really talented, my customers.

701
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,890
Oh, sorry, we're out.

702
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:38,910
So sorry.

703
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,550
So sorry.

704
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,310
Diarrhea everywhere!

705
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,130
Wait!

706
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,010
We have to clean it up one letter at a time!

707
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,130
Who's...

708
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,750
There's not diarrhea everywhere!

709
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,750
No!

710
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,010
I don't think we've had any cheaters.

711
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,010
That makes me sad.

712
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,830
Excuse me.

713
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,050
Diarrhea everywhere.

714
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,490
Oh, I got the wrong thing!

715
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,270
That's fine.

716
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,820
We have people waiting on lemonade anyway.

717
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:25,520
Hello?

718
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,780
Add lemon?

719
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,480
Of course.

720
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,920
Do better next time!

721
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,940
out of the lemon, though.

722
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,980
I want lemonade at eyes.

723
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,840
I might have done a thing.

724
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,340
What does that mean?

725
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,420
What does that mean?

726
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,120
When did eyes is...

727
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,640
Oh!

728
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,520
Did I forget one?

729
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,410
She's a cheater!

730
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,310
Where is she?

731
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,350
Where is she?

732
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:00,870
Where's she go?

733
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,490
Where'd the cheater go?

734
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:03,870
She in the bathroom?

735
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,610
Poop everywhere!

736
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,130
People are graffitiing my...

737
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,100
People are graffitiing my place!

738
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,620
My birthday today!

739
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,920
Daptonia!

740
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,060
Happy birthday!

741
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,000
Happy happy birthday!

742
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,240
Add ice and lemon.

743
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:36,780
Sorry.

744
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,760
Owner has zero!

745
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,580
Oro, Oro!

746
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:42,680
No!

747
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,460
Who let Gen Z into my park?

748
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,440
That was me.

749
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
I wrote that.

750
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,020
No!

751
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,980
Decoration level.

752
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,820
We made a lot of money in it, though, maybe.

753
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,360
Welcome to King.

754
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,880
I think.

755
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,040
I think we made a good amount of money.

756
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,420
Evil.

757
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,240
Esmeralda was evil.

758
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,360
Oro, look.

759
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,220
behavior.

760
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,080
No!

761
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,840
I have aura!

762
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,700
Oh, no!

763
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,260
Oh, it's nice and quiet now.

764
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,520
I love this time of day.

765
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,480
A ghost is laughing in my park.

766
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:50,010
Yeah, now we might... I think last time I tried to hire a janitor and it glitched out so now we can hire the janitor for real

767
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,410

769
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,340
Someone with aura wouldn't be scared.

770
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,480
Oh, no.

771
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:28,920
Zora.

772
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,020
Oh, Zora.

773
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,460
Oh, owner.

774
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,080
Wait, I was combining owner and zero.

775
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,340
Owner has a hundred aura.

776
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,620
Your new opening and ending transition are very cute.

777
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,300
Oh, thank you.

778
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,720
Thank you, Zora.

779
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,860
Glad you like it.

780
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,600
Hee.

781
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,020
Hee, hee, hee.

782
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,980
Oh, I got a 10 out of 10 throw.

783
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:53,660
Let's go.

784
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,440
Owner has Zora.

785
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,020
It's true.

786
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:02,800
Wait.

787
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,080
More graffiti.

788
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,220
Keso was here.

789
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,340
Is he the one graffitiing?

790
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,040
Clean small semi-circular pool filters.

791
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,540
Oh!

792
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,760
I think people were getting COVID.

793
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,540
Let's go.

794
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,760
It got so bad.

795
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,020
It'll be fine in the morning.

796
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,080
I'm sure.

797
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,840
It'll be fine in the morning.

798
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,580
They got super COVID.

799
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,420
Oh, I guess the filters are clean now.

800
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,720
Is that all?

801
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,580
That's all I needed to do?

802
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,080
This one's pretty bad also.

803
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,640
It looks like it's about to die.

804
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,080
We don't tell you to drink the water, so...

805
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,300
But, it is a gotcha.

806
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,100
Maybe we should advertise that.

807
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:06,560
If you drink the water, it's like a 1 in 32 chance that you will develop a superpower.

808
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,620
That's pretty tempting, though.

809
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,730
I wonder if this toilet was the one that was broken.

810
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:16,250
No?

811
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:22,270
Superpower gotcha.

812
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,050
I would try.

813
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,690
I have nothing to lose.

814
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:30,870
There's so much to clean now.

815
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,610
Did I get everything, you think?

816
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,930
I got the chairs.

817
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:39,990
Got the pool.

818
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,070
Got the bathrooms.

819
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,250
We restocked.

820
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,020
Chances are low, but never 0%.

821
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,560
Exactly.

822
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:51,800
We just have to try.

823
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,480
Is there anything that we can unlock?

824
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,590
Oh, we have eight.

825
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:00,590
Okay.

826
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:01,230
Nice.

827
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,090
Maintenance decorations.

828
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:04,850
Small things that make big impressions.

829
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:07,770
Modern showers.

830
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:08,830
Trash highlight.

831
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:09,650
That's kind of nice.

832
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,670
One out of 32 is unironically great chances for a gotcha.

833
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,250
You think?

834
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,770
Oh, sorry.

835
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:19,490
I said 32.

836
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,710
I meant 3200.

837
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,370
32,000.

838
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,110
My bad.

839
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,290
I wonder what the people want to listen to.

840
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,090
Modern pools.

841
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,290
Maybe we should do that.

842
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,170
That would be fun.

843
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,090
Now you're thinking.

844
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,760
Exactly.

845
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,920
Vending machine.

846
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,680
Attraction decorations.

847
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
How much money do I have?

848
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,080
Lifeguards!

849
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,580
Oh, but I can only hire like one people or two people at a time, no?

850
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,720
What?

851
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,600
What was the thing?

852
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,120
Y-pad is tabbed.

853
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,040
There we go.

854
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,740
Uh, we'll do it tomorrow, but we'll do...

855
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,660
Someone.

856
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,720
For now, I want to see what we got here.

857
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,680
Oh, more plants.

858
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,660
They just keep giving me plants.

859
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,780
Is this gonna...

860
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,480
Is this gonna increase the attractiveness?

861
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,520
A plant?

862
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,720
Yeah, I can only...

863
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:47,680
do two right now let's do some vending machines that'll be big people like vending machines can

864
00:49:50,970 --> 00:50:00,410
i afford oh they're expensive that's all i can afford okay that's fine it's a little off-center

865
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:15,290
it costs 1200 wait i won't be able to afford a person We might have to wait one more day before we can hire somebody.

866
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:16,990
But we'll make money off of this.

867
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,290
This is passive income.

868
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,090
Did you see your Oshi was at the...

869
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:28,870
I saw Mike from Red Letter Media was at the WWE event, and he's, like, jamming to the music.

870
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,030
I love that guy.

871
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,970
Granola bar.

872
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:36,610
Yummy.

873
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,590
Okay, all right, let's sleep.

874
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:45,030
Tomorrow's a new day.

875
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,130
Good morning, Minto.

876
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,010
Good morning, Brailan.

877
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,410
How are you doing today?

878
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,490
Bright and early.

879
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,610
That's my man up at the crack.

880
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,090
Wait, I have to restock this?

881
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,890
Oh, okay.

882
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,590
Do I, can I afford it?

883
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,500
No.

884
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,800
Chippos.

885
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,400
COVID, oh, see, there is COVID here.

886
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,140
Oh, granola.

887
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,340
Okay, good thing I can buy it.

888
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,660
Passive income.

889
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,300
That's a lot.

890
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,440
Alright, our goal today is to kill the cheaters.

891
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,650
6-7.

892
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,370
Oh my god.

893
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,330
6-7.

894
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:46,910
Stop.

895
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:48,750
Who's graffitying my place?

896
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,790
I cleaned it.

897
00:51:49,810 --> 00:52:14,510

898
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:25,290
we'll keep it i don't get it it's i don't even know how to explain it.

899
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:33,070
I've listened to things on how people have explained it and it's it's it's it's doesn't make any sense.

900
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,730
Looking minty today.

901
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:37,650
Look at this!

902
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,730
Wait we have a coffee machine and a fridge!

903
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,070
Wait I didn't realize all of this got cleared out.

904
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,330
Alright Braylon, it's all up to you.

905
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,310
We're almost in the red buddy.

906
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:52,650
I don't want to stress you out but like I need I need money.

907
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:53,730
I need customers.

908
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,330
I need big profits, okay?

909
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,550
I need big, big profits.

911
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:01,870
Sorry.

912
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,070
I'm not the owner of Brailin's.

913
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,990
If someone hit you, talk to Brailin.

914
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,930
Wouldn't Brailin's the graffitier?

915
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:11,650
He wouldn't be.

916
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,780
I'm ready.

917
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,720
I'm ready to kill.

918
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,820
I'm ready to kill.

919
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,680
I'm ready to kill.

920
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,600
What, six, seven?

921
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,080
My niece?

922
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,900
keeps on saying it, I have no idea.

923
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,660
It's like, okay, the best of my abilities, where's that guy?

924
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,480
Is he ever coming out?

925
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:57,460
So the best of my abilities to describe it, it's like, there was a song or something, and he says 6-7 in it, and then people started editing it to basketball, and then more people started saying it, and that's all I know.

926
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,140
Wow.

927
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,340
I don't really get it.

928
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,980
I don't understand it.

929
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,640
All because of a song?

930
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,240
Apparently.

931
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,260
And like they would make edits of like basketball players being like, yeah, six, seven.

932
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,300
I don't get it.

933
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,540
So it's nothing?

934
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,160
Like actually, it's so unfunny it hurts.

935
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,900
It's painful.

936
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,480
Drowning already

937
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:49,110

973
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,600
Nice throw.

974
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,420
I'm killing it.

975
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,240
I'm killing it.

976
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,220
I am the best at running a park ever.

977
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,100
A plane.

978
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,240
Raylan, I need you to lock in, buddy.

979
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,560
I need you to lock in.

980
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,980
We're going to be in the red if it's not for you, okay?

981
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,000
Whoa, everybody got up at the same time.

982
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:44,700
Did you see that?

983
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,900
It's pretty freaky.

984
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,260
Hey, cheater.

985
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,860
Okay, just three more cheaters and we'll be good.

986
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,640
Braylon is not doing the job well.

987
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,780
Well, actually, oh, no, you're the guy.

988
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,380
Okay, good.

989
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,420
Okay, good.

990
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,860
I'm looking for wristbands here, wristbands here.

991
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,100
Yes, yes.

992
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,080
Wristbands, wristbands.

993
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,260
Sorry, my bad.

994
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,740
There we go.

995
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,120
Ah!

996
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,780
So far, so good.

997
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,260
Wait, I feel like my park is kind of empty.

998
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,300
Is it Braille?

999
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,820
Oh, wait, you have a wristband.

1000
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,980
Why did you have an evil symbol on your head then?

1001
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,320
Wait.

1002
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,780
Is it her?

1003
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,180
No, she has a wristband.

1004
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:50,720
Wait.

1005
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,480
Oh, it's him!

1006
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:53,820
No, it's not.

1007
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,320
Wait.

1008
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,220
I saw it, you guys saw it, right?

1009
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:04,650
Add ice.

1010
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,200
Plane.

1011
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,040
It was her.

1012
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,300
She was trolling.

1013
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,850
Are you gonna make six, seven edits of me?

1014
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,340
Oh, oh wow.

1015
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,620
People actually use this chair.

1016
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,440
It's kind of impressive.

1017
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,900
I'm coming, I'm running at the speed of light.

1018
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,340
A lemonade, right?

1019
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,420
Add ice.

1020
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:43,580
Yep.

1021
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:49,610
Yep.

1022
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,710
Is anyone using this pool?

1023
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:51,510
Look at that!

1024
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,430
There's two people in here!

1025
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:55,830
Of course people are...

1026
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,090
I'm using my pool.

1027
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,130
Guess waited too long for a ticket.

1028
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:01,550
Uh-oh.

1029
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,590
Uh-oh.

1030
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:03,210
Uh-oh.

1031
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:03,590
Braylon.

1032
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:04,230
Braylon.

1033
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:05,330
Uh-oh.

1034
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,490
Four hours, senior.

1035
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,410
Someone's drowning.

1036
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:11,730
Somewhere.

1037
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,770
Uh, must be the other side.

1038
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,410
The lemonade is what?

1039
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,530
Stupendous.

1040
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,130
Delicious?

1041
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:21,270
Nutritious?

1042
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:25,790
Senior 4-hour?

1043
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:30,350
A lot of old people like to come to the park.

1044
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:34,170
But swimming is good for old people.

1045
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:38,810
Wow.

1046
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,170
People here are crazy.

1047
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,980
Waited too long for lemonade!

1048
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,820
I just gave it to them!

1049
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,360
I give the people what they want.

1050
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,480
Is anyone using this?

1051
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,020
Oh, they are.

1052
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,100
They're buying the...

1053
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:58,580
They're buying them.

1054
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,230
How much are they?

1055
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,080

1056
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,340

$20, $20 grendola bars!

1058
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,120
I think I'm a scammer.

1059
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,660
It's all ice monkey.

1060
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,000
That's insanity.

1061
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,240
What's wrong with my...

1062
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:26,940
What's this one say?

1063
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,240
That's so not true.

1064
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,500
There's puddles everywhere.

1065
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,340
And I'm working on it.

1066
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,120
I'm working on it.

1067
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,240
I'm working on it.

1068
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,460
Is like food illegal in this world or something?

1069
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880

1070
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,400

01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,160
Alright, get out of the way.

1081
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,380

Right now your water park's flooring is plain and forgettable.

1110
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,880
But you're not here to be average.

01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,840
Unlock the floor tool.

1112
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,880
Okay, so it's forcing us to do this.

1122
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,170
The floor I'd stare.

1123
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,230
Uh, dog?

1124
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,030
For you?

1125
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:44,530
For you?

1126
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:44,930
Oh.

1127
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,790
Alright.

1128
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,590
Let's clean up the park, baby.

1129
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:55,590
Today was pretty good.

1130
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:56,230
See you soon!

1131
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,370
Thank you for the dog.

1132
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:00,290
We did it.

1133
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,370
We did it, team.

1134
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:06,410
We're at $1,500.

1135
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:11,910
Unlock the floor research tool, okay.

1136
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,650
Nice haul today.

1137
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:24,990
I mean, granola bars cost $20, apparently.

1138
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:28,630
I'm the worst person in the world, I think.

1139
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,430
We're charging that.

1140
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:37,790
You know, I feel maybe the cheaters are a little justified.

1141
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,370
I think we can afford to hire someone now.

1142
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,510
I think so too.

1143
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,040
Okay, we got that one.

1144
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,950
Just con food prices.

1145
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:06,590
It's like when you go to a theme park and the water bottles are $7.

1146
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:09,530
They're like...

1147
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,770
Holy moly.

1148
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:42,190
It's one thing I love so much about like a Tokyo Disney is like the vending machine prices are normal like for for like a tea or something it's all just normal prices I can only say for Disney because I've never been to like USJ and I don't remember the prices at Fujikil.

1149
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:51,150
But you go to Disney in the States and it's like crazy.

1150
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,510
$10 drink.

1151
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:55,070
Okay.

1152
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,100
Oh, this one.

1153
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,730
Okay.

1154
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:01,610
The specialty.

1155
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,370
Alright, that should be everything.

1156
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,430
So now we paint the floors.

1157
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:10,520
Okay.

1158
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,130
Unlock...

1159
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,370
Is it probably under park?

1160
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,010
Floor tool!

1161
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,310
Cashier training!

1162
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:27,510
Water park no death pass and ticket I brought in the first stream do not count as expired.

1163
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:31,920
Of course!

1164
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,140
If you are drowning, I will throw a floaty to you.

1165
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:36,660
100%.

1166
01:08:41,420 --> 01:09:17,640
I'm not usually into theme parks, but you kind of sold me on Tokyo Disney based on that Tokyo Disney is so great even if you don't like theme parks I recommend Tokyo Disney see a hundred percent the the place is just so atmospheric in general floor tool floor tool okay change color what do we want maybe the granola bar is up your superpower chances one to thirty two thousand one and three thirty 100.

1167
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:18,320
So true.

1168
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,460
Tokyo Disney see what?

1169
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:24,840
See your mom.

1170
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:31,160
Okay, so if we're Zanzibar land, maybe we should do like a desert-y theme, right?

1171
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,500
Okay, let's do this area.

1172
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:34,180
Oh.

1173
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,260
Oh.

1174
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,720
Oh, we have to do 30 floors.

1175
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,040
Okay.

1176
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,260
Alright, alright, team.

1177
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,520
We got this.

1178
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,300
Okay.

1179
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,100
Wait, we're already at 15.

1180
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,420
17.

1181
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,520
18.

1182
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:52,880
Wait.

1183
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,080
Huh?

1184
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,700
It's counting strange.

1185
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:56,740
A little bit.

1186
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:57,160
20?

1187
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:02,240
The game doesn't know how to count, I think.

1188
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:02,940
That's okay.

1189
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,700
We believe.

1190
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,520
Oh, okay.

1191
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,780
Uh, okay.

1192
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:12,880
Fire Brailin?

1193
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:13,960
He's a liability.

1194
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,060
What do you mean?

1195
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,660
You think he's...

1196
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,200
wanted artists.

1197
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,680
You're not the only one decorating the park.

1198
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,480
Some guests leave their own creative marks on your walls.

1199
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,540
Graffiti is a form of art, but those guys are no match to your creative vision.

1200
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:26,760
Trek down these vandals.

1201
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:31,200
I have to... Okay, it's just clean the graffiti from vandals.

1202
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,240
It's not like find the guys who are doing it.

1203
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,980
I don't know how to do that.

1204
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,280
Look, actually, this kind of looks nice.

1205
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,580
No fun zone.

1206
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,580
No fun allowed.

1207
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,360
Oh, oh!

1208
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,160
Poop everywhere!

1209
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:54,740
Poop everywhere!

1210
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,380
Poop everywhere!

1211
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,960
They're so wrong about this.

1212
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:08,660
I- I- I've never seen maybe poop like two times in my park.

1213
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,720
Three max?

1214
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,080
And also that's not my fault.

1215
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,660
Don't blame the park, blame the people who are pooping on the ground.

1216
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,320
Okay.

1217
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,000
Wow!

1218
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,500
Our little park is looking so dandy.

1219
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,060
Do we have any more slides?

1220
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:32,600
No.

1221
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,780
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to get these mega slides.

1222
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,220
$15,000!

1223
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,000
Okay.

1224
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,220
Alright, tomorrow we'll hire...

1225
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,340
Who do you think we should hire?

1226
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,780
A janitor or a handyman?

1227
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,910
Let's check the size of the toilets since they like to do that too.

1228
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:57,860
No?

1229
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,680
The backs?

1230
01:11:59,200 --> 01:11:59,360
Oh!

1231
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:07,060
LOL H What does that mean?

1232
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:12,350
Handy mail?

1233
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:14,310
LOL H?

1234
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,160
Just got back from my trip to Japan and visited Disney Sea after thank you for inspiring me to go and experience Occupy and Mids as well.

1235
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,420
Mr. Phantom, are you my father?

1236
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,700
Thanks for sharing your passions and inspiring us.

1237
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:33,400
Thank you!

1238
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,240
I'm so glad you had fun, it seems like.

1239
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,120
LOLH

1240
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,640
Yuppie!

1241
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,420
Oh wow, it's so bright.

1242
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,240
Oh wow, look at it.

1243
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,240
Everyone will surely appreciate their eyes being blinded.

1244
01:12:54,440 --> 01:13:00,900
I love when I go to a water park and the ground is like so bright I can't see anything.

1245
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,240
Oh wait, before we do that, let's hire someone.

1246
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,260
Uh, tab, tab, tab.

1247
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,560
Ah, janitor?

1248
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,820
Well, we have no handymen, so janitor it is.

1249
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,620
This person has pretty good efficiency, just they're slow.

1250
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,100
Wait, this person's pretty good, no?

1251
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,840
They're all slow.

1252
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,380
Why are these guys so much more expensive?

1253
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:33,860
When this guy has better endurance and efficiency and everything, and he's cheap.

1254
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,060
Good morning, Minky.

1255
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,300
Please hire me my resume.

1256
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,960
I'm cute girl.

1257
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,020
Don't go till you're hired for life.

1258
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:53,230
Okay, we hired Victor.

1259
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:55,830
Victor, where are you at, buddy?

1260
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:58,750

1261
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:02,670
Victor!

1262
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:05,910
He's bald and he's proud.

1263
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,850
Whoa, look at him go.

1264
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,530
Look at him go.

1265
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:17,750
Sweeping where nobody even thought thought to sweep what an overachiever oh just getting here

1266
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:44,110

And she said that she said, oh, oh no, my bathing suit came off.

1270
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,240
I think that happens to more girls than you guys realize.

1271
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,740
It's happened to me before.

1272
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,660
Not where I asked, I was by myself on the slide, but my top came off.

1273
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,340
And I was like, yeah!

1274
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,400
But really?

1275
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:04,900
Yeah!

1276
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,540
It was, um...

1277
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:07,940
Yeah.

1278
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:13,970
Ghost.

1279
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:16,210
Ghost.

1280
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,440
Double knot your tops, ladies.

1281
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:23,880
For real!

1282
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,620
Oh, hot dog.

1283
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,780
Wait, did I restock?

1284
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,640
I'm so sorry.

1285
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,680
I keep forgetting to restock the lemonade and the... I'm gonna drop this here.

1286
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,900
So we can get both at once.

1287
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,540
Wait, I think I might need to restock the granola too.

1288
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:43,900
It's not a...

1289
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,320
It's a feature, not a bug?

1290
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:46,280
What do you mean?

1291
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,280
No!

1292
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,440
I'm sorry!

1293
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,180
Yeah, let's go get more granola too.

1294
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,420
I think it happens to people more often.

1295
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:08,340
So now if I ever go to a water park, which I have not been...

1296
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,220
I think that was the last time I win.

1297
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:12,660
I...

1298
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:14,840
I will not...

1299
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,960
We're probably a bikini.

1300
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,610
I didn't get banned.

1301
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,340
I'm looking around for graffiti.

1302
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,420
Who could be the culprit?

1303
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,940
You are in a water park.

1304
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:40,760
Um, look at me.

1305
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,440
Do I look like I'm ready to swim?

1306
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,440
Is it a cold day?

1307
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,300
Why are my nips showing?

1308
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,660
Everyone's been seeing that.

1309
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,460
Oh my gosh.

1310
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,280
Oh, nope.

1311
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,880
He's really excited about the job.

1312
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:08,920
Clearly.

1313
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:09,700
Wow.

1314
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:17,080
I mean, with all these bathing suits around, I don't blame him.

1315
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,480
Add lemon.

1316
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,320
Yep.

1317
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,540
Why are you staring at me?

1318
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,220
Oh, you were not staring at me.

1319
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,220
I like when I get their order and they go, yep.

1320
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,840
Can cut glass with those.

1321
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:45,410
Yeah, nobody gets ice here.

1322
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:46,750
You spoke too soon.

1323
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,110
Add lemon.

1324
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:53,410
But surely it's a cold day because no one gets...

1325
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,030
Not lemon.

1326
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,850
No one gets ice, so...

1327
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:56,530
Add mustard.

1328
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:58,910
Uh-huh.

1329
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,460
Add mustard.

1330
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,200
Any graffiti, guys?

1331
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:09,460
None.

1332
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,320
Trash.

1333
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,560
Even though my trash bags are...

1334
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:13,820
Oh.

1335
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,540
Add lemon.

1336
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:25,680
I love where we're here on this beautiful December day in the water park.

1337
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,640
Everybody, yeah, everybody's oiled up.

1338
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,320
Oh no, no!

1339
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,540
Everything's fine.

1340
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,020
1 in 30, 2,000 chance.

1341
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:46,980
Okay.

1342
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:53,850
Someone's drowning!

1343
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:56,430
Your needs are not important!

1344
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:04,780
Hello!

1345
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,400
Add ice.

1346
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,960
I'm too good at this game.

1347
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,080
Where is our... where is our janitor, huh?

1348
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,760

01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:52,610
A kid just died.

1354
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,070
Oh, someone's panicking.

1355
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:58,860
Hello.

1356
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,620
Slide past four-hour team.

1357
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,560
Breylin, don't just turn your back on the people.

1358
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,280
They're gonna see you there.

1359
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,360
And they're gonna know you're working.

1360
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,160
You can't just turn your back on them.

1361
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,160
Oh my god.

1362
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:24,960
He's like, if I don't see them, maybe they won't come in.

1363
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,440
Uh, Tien, four hours.

1364
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:35,680
Oh, Braylon's back, okay.

1365
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,220
That was close.

1366
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,100
Don't slip.

1367
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:42,680
Don't slip.

1368
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,400
Everyone is so tan and...

1369
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:52,130
It wasn't me!

1370
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:54,010
I'm mad at me!

1371
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,960
It's always...

1372
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,100
It's always this chair.

1373
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,540
Everyone's so tan here.

1374
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:10,600
Isabella, you'll get there.

1375
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,200
Don't worry.

1376
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,320
Hello.

1377
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,000
Ice and lemon.

1378
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,360
I think there's a...

1379
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,300
I think there's a...

1380
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:21,580
Yeah.

1381
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,240
Little puddle here.

1382
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,460
I hope this is water.

1383
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,380
I hope this is water.

1384
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,340
I hope this is water.

1385
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,600
I haven't seen any graffiti.

1386
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,080
Maybe I got all of it before.

1387
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,000
Lemonade.

1388
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,960
This place is cursed.

1389
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,580
I told you it's haunted.

1390
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:41,380
Yes?

1391
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,440
What the?

1392
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,800
Put credit on Victor's name.

1393
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,000
I mean, he's probably doing a bunch.

1394
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:58,620
Probably.

1395
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:03,780
Okay.

1396
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,920
And I'm also doing a bunch, okay?

1397
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,900
Remy is waiting for Lemonade.

1398
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,820
Add ice.

1399
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:14,300
Mm-hmm.

1400
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:16,900
Did the price go up?

1401
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:17,840
I feel?

1402
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,160
Am I crazy?

1403
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:23,760
Yeah.

1404
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:24,660
$20.

1405
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,960
It's crazy.

1406
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,750
I got it.

1407
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,030
Wow.

1408
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,680
I'm gonna go get some more people in.

1409
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,360
Oh, sorry.

1410
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,140
What a dramatic flail.

1411
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,620
Broken toilet?

1412
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,060
Which one?

1413
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:57,650
This one?

1414
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:06,660
No.

1415
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:07,600
Graffiti.

1416
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:09,600
Huh.

1417
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,280
Why was there so much before?

1418
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,200
Now suddenly.

1419
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,980
Yeah, the park closes soon-ish.

1420
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,300
Don't hammer the guests.

1421
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,500
I'll do what I want.

1422
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:41,430
Alright, catch this.

1423
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:43,150
He's still paid to drown.

1424
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:47,350
There you go.

1425
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,550
Uh-oh, do I have lemonade?

1426
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:51,570
Oh, I think that's the last one.

1427
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,170
Add ice.

1428
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:54,530
Nice.

1429
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:57,770
Evil!

1430
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:02,550
Yeah!

1431
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,350
Yeah!

1432
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,070
Yeah!

1433
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:05,590
Kill, kill, kill!

1434
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,870
Wait, maybe I need you to do graffiti though.

1435
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:10,510
Where's the graffiti?

1436
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,040
Why is there no graffiti?

1437
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,040
As soon as I need it, it's gone.

1438
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,780
Oh, we got some tips!

1439
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,100
Wait, we got 78 tips!

1440
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,600
$78 in tips!

1441
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,780
Get better reviews to get bigger tips.

1442
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,000
I think we did a pretty good job today.

1443
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,520
Very nice!

1444
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:47,850
Nice tips.

1445
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,750
Oh look, I think he's been cleaning these too.

1446
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:55,070
Oh my gosh.

1447
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,550
Wait, Victor's the goat?

1448
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,490
He's so helpful.

1449
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,370
I can't wait to be able to hire more people.

1450
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,930
Bending machines are superior?

1451
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:11,150
Okay, this also needs to be repaired, so let's see.

1452
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:12,610
Remember that as well.

1453
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,470
Look, this one doesn't even need to be cleaned!

1454
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:19,850
Victor's amazing!

1455
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:25,580
Nice.

1456
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:27,140
How is that a 5 out of 10?

1457
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,700
Okay, we're gonna add more vending machines.

1458
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:36,140
Maybe, well, vending machine, because I don't think I can afford very many more.

1459
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,860
Victor's doing his job!

1460
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:42,860
Well, mostly.

1461
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,600
This one was pretty dirty.

1462
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:49,420
But he's done a great job so far.

1463
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:59,410
Yeah, if we go with the vending machine, I feel like we should get rid of the hot dogs then.

1464
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:02,250
No, people don't want to dress granola bars.

1465
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,090
Maybe.

1466
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:03,950
I don't know.

1467
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:07,630
There's really no graffiti at all.

1468
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:08,770
Nothing?

1469
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,750
No one wants to vandalize my park?

1470
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,170
But it's so pristine and shiny.

1471
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:15,530
It's ripe for the pickin.

1472
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,900
It's so graffiti.

1473
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,560
No one?

1474
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,620
No one wants to write poop everywhere?

1475
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:39,330
I can do a little bit of vandalism.

1476
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:45,150
I don't think Victor would clean it up unless it went towards...

1477
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:49,090
What's it called?

1478
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:51,230
The task list.

1479
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:51,870
You know?

1480
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:56,790
Hmm.

1481
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,060
run too tight of a ship.

1482
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:06,960
What can I say?

1483
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,720
I'm just too good at my job.

1484
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,880
I wasn't able to catch you live, but Monday was my birthday, Reach!

1485
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,560
Happy birthday!

1486
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:21,300
I watched the last Half-Life 2 bot, and the game I would recommend is the Batman Arkham series.

1487
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,120
No L-O-H?

1488
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:27,880
Nothing.

1489
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,620
I see no graffiti at all.

1490
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:47,750
Granola is 50 bucks, but we sell too and that's almost the amount to cover it.

1491
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:50,110
Okay, nice.

1492
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:53,610
Maybe we add a slide here.

1493
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:57,410
A really fun one.

1494
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,690
We'll put it like right here.

1495
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,950
Yeah.

1496
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:06,690
Now more people will go over to this area too.

1497
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:11,570
And what we're gonna do then also is put a vending machine.

1498
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:13,930
Wait, what's this?

1499
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:15,030
A jump board?

1500
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:16,610
Whoa!

1501
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:18,550
When did we get this?

1502
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:20,230
Wait, this is different.

1503
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:23,950
Oh, oh, we have new different pool types, too.

1504
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,870
How much was this?

1505
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:29,670
350?

1506
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:31,830
Okay, I think we have enough for a vending machine.

1507
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:38,910
Let's put the vending machine right as soon as they enter the park.

1508
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,160
Right here.

1509
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:45,880
Right here.

1510
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:47,940
Right.

1511
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,080
Here.

1512
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,580
We'll put it in between.

1513
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:55,960
We'll move this.

1514
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,920
To like here.

1515
01:30:58,820 --> 01:30:59,460
Right here, yeah.

1516
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,440
And then we'll move this.

1517
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:02,860
Here.

1518
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:07,320
Yes.

1519
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,620
You ever get to upgrade your tent?

1520
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,700
I sure hope so.

1521
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:14,860
Alright.

1522
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,260
Let's build.

1523
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,480
Now more people will come over here and they'll see the vending machines.

1524
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,660
Wow, this is fun.

1525
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,740
We got a big diving board now.

1526
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:32,270
Nice.

1527
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:33,910
Oh, it needs to be restocked.

1528
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:34,430
So, drill.

1529
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:38,950
I hope I have enough money to pay my employees.

1530
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:39,570
Welcome.

1531
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:40,570
Okay.

1532
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:43,490
I don't want to be like a certain company.

1533
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:46,110
Okay.

1534
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:49,550
All right.

1535
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:52,470
Oh, it's clipping a little, but that's fine.

1536
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:57,960
Too soon?

1537
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:02,580
All right.

1538
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,080
All right, team.

1539
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,120
Good morning, team.

1540
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,180
Good morning, Brailing.

1541
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,120
Good morning, Victor.

1542
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:09,220
Are we ready?

1543
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,760
I've got, we're all stocked.

1544
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:12,620
We're all clean.

1545
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,540
We've got new attractions.

1546
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,700
This place is bustling.

1547
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:18,460
We're going to get tons of graffiti.

1548
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:19,500
Let's go.

1549
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,640
Throw as much shade as you want.

1550
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,360
Roast them.

1551
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,400
Did I clean these or did?

1552
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,200
Okay, cool.

1553
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:41,290
What about the trashyard?

1554
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:41,810
Okay.

1555
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:43,890
Nice throw time out of 10.

1556
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:48,050
My tiles?

1557
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:49,630
What's wrong with my tiles?

1558
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:50,070
These?

1559
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:51,930
Oh, because I didn't finish it?

1560
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:53,850
Well, I need more money.

1561
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:57,810
So, you know, you could come to my park and spend lots of money and then I will...

1562
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:02,310
be able to paint the rest.

1563
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,690
Why the cutie on the bottom right now is swimming?

1564
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:07,490
Ah!

1565
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:12,430
Yeah!

1566
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,670
I'm swimming.

1567
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,230
I want to jump on this, can I?

1568
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:22,810
Woo-hoo!

1569
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,220
Good swim.

1570
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,700
Alright, I'll start doing more.

1571
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,080
Oh, this is not the floor tool.

1572
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,480
I'm silly.

1573
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,020
Hot dog!

1574
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:39,960
Hot dog!

1575
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:47,300
Hey, Autic!

1576
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,180
Welcome to Membership, thank you!

1577
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:51,260
Yep.

1578
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,400
Oh, I need to...

1579
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,020
Where did I put my flyers at?

1580
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,060
Oh, here they are.

1581
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,020
We can go pass these out.

1582
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:01,560
Hey!

1583
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:02,700
Hey, hey, hey!

1584
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:04,660
Yes!

1585
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:05,560
Got her.

1586
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:06,200
Fished her.

1587
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:06,760
Easy.

1588
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,480
Look at this line.

1589
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,000
Hello, everybody.

1590
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,520
Welcome in.

1591
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:17,040
Welcome in.

1592
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:20,980
You.

1593
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,760
You're thinking of a water park today.

1594
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,460
Yeah, you were.

1595
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,640
Oh, you're thinking of a water park today.

1596
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,020
Yeah.

1597
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,840
Good playlist.

1598
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,360
Thank you so much for the 50s.

1599
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,120
Thank you.

1600
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,020
Thank you.

1601
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:41,340
Would enjoy it between smack and thugs upside the head through Joker asking if Batman dreams about him in a thought!

1602
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,820
Reach, you're speaking my language.

1603
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,460
Happy birthday again!

1604
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,800
What is written here?

1605
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,320
Maybe it's on the other side.

1606
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:56,700
Oh, it's the menu.

1607
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,040
Big to small, sweet, and sour, natural juice.

1608
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,860
I mean, it is fresh lemon, so...

1609
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:11,450
Christopher!

1610
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:12,790
Get in there, Christopher!

1611
01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,650
Yeah, let him.

1612
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:18,750
Go to the vending machine.

1613
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:20,690
Give me money.

1614
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:22,730
Look, oh, I'm dying.

1615
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,390
If you don't pay me, this is what will happen.

1616
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:29,490
We're feeding you the shower?

1617
01:35:30,870 --> 01:35:31,170
Wait.

1618
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:34,350
You saw some?

1619
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:35,070
You saw some?

1620
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:37,990
You're right!

1621
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,270
Blue hoodies suck.

1622
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:42,730
I'm not wearing a blue hoodie.

1623
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:51,730
3 out of 5!

1624
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:51,970
3 out of 5!

1625
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:52,390
Woohoo!

1626
01:35:56,850 --> 01:35:57,290
Graffiti!

1627
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:00,110
Let's go.

1628
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:01,950
There's two more graffitis.

1629
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:03,170
I mean, one more graffitis.

1630
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:13,060
I wish I would say add both, kind of like the other one, you know?

1631
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:15,980
So much pee!

1632
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:16,940
Yippee!

1633
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,700
Last one!

1634
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:22,240
I swallowed a band-aid at Zanzibar Land and got an infection.

1635
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,240
Oh!

1636
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:28,980
Unlock the ticket ATM via Research Tree, and it will handle ticket sales automatically.

1637
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:34,520
It only takes cards, so guests with cash will still go to the counter.

1638
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:40,920
6-7.

1639
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,820
Okay, no more graffiti, please.

1640
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,580
I'm over it.

1641
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:48,260
Graffiti.

1642
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,040
Jose, welcome to membership, welcome back!

1643
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:54,140
I'm doing playlists, thank you for another 50!

1644
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,540
What the heck?

1645
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:56,080
Why?

1646
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:57,680
Thank you, though.

1647
01:36:57,900 --> 01:36:58,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1648
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,700
What do you want, Lemonade?

1649
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:07,340
Glizzy Nation!

1650
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,980
Okay, but that's not even graffiti.

1651
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,600
Wait, I want to watch you do this.

1652
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:13,080
Nice.

1653
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,140
That's the truth.

1654
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,020
Glizzy Nation!

1655
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,020
I felt that one.

1656
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:25,780
Oh, I see evil.

1657
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,100
I see someone naughty.

1658
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:29,400
Is it you?

1659
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:30,700
No, you have a wristband on.

1660
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:32,420
Oh, you do too.

1661
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:33,540
Wait, where are you?

1662
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,440
Who just pooped?

1663
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,600
Yeah, you.

1664
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,380
Oh, it's supposed to be LRL high.

1665
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,230
Why is everyone...

1666
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,550
Hot dogs are...

1667
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:49,950
Ay, ay, ay, ay!

1668
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:55,090
I caught a vandal.

1669
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:57,630
Hot dogs are...

1670
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:01,090
What does it say?

1671
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,070
I'm suing.

1672
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:07,530
Why are there so many vandals now?

1673
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:09,850
Stale?

1674
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:12,330
That's what I read, too, but that doesn't make any sense.

1675
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,300
Crabbs is up.

1676
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,640
I love that episode.

1677
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:24,280
It's so funny.

1678
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,800
Well, you see Trashware.

1679
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,160
Duke is drowning.

1680
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,240
What has Duke ever done to you?

1681
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:31,960
for me, huh?

1682
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:33,460
Oh.

1683
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,580
Oh, he's giving me money.

1684
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,260
You know what?

1685
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:38,860
Oh.

1686
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:42,880
This isn't about him.

1687
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:48,440
We have people graffitiing and people peeing and, I mean, pooping at ice.

1688
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,920
People throwing their trash on the ground.

1689
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:56,060
I saw it.

1690
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:56,560
Oh, there it is.

1691
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,340
Trash in here, too?

1692
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:02,900
Oh my god.

1693
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:11,460
I got the trash don't worry this is a clean park poop

1694
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:40,830
everywhere I like how the graffiti moves it's so funny you he he'd right in front of me add lemon okay yeah and add ketchup hello add ice and then Kaiso.

1695
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:42,250
Kaiso.

1696
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:42,750
Yummy.

1697
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:44,650
I want some Kaiso.

1698
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,880
So much pee!

1699
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:51,780
No!

1700
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,280
No!

1701
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:57,240
No!

1702
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,030
I don't know what this one says.

1703
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,190
Something in the...

1704
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:09,890
I'm getting all these vandals.

1705
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:14,730
This is why people have lost their men.

1706
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:19,630
Uh-oh, two people drowning.

1707
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:20,970
We have to decide who to save.

1708
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:22,290
It's the Walking Dead.

1709
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:26,190
Crazy cosmic penance.

1710
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:31,410
Boring.

1711
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:32,770
Oh my gosh.

1712
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:34,150
I'm gonna kill you people.

1713
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:35,650
I'm gonna kill all you.

1714
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:37,310
Bros.

1715
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:38,350
Chopped!

1716
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:39,090
No!

1717
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:42,030
Please!

1718
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,290
Christopher will remember.

1721
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:27,050
Lying on the job?

1722
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,770
Okay, he's working.

1723
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,920
Esmeralda, you can wait two seconds for me to mop this up.

1724
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:45,710
Okay.

1725
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:47,030
Alright.

1726
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:48,170
It's almost four.

1727
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:49,830
Then we can get the automatic ticket.

1728
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,990
Wow, I did not think.

1729
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,190
Her bathing suit.

1730
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:55,030
It did not look like she was wearing anything.

1731
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:57,110
I thought we...

1732
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,590
had a nudist at the park.

1733
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:00,250
Add lemon.

1734
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:01,610
You got it, sir.

1735
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:08,110
Why is that pool the designated drowning pool?

1736
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,950
I don't know.

1737
01:42:09,850 --> 01:42:13,310
Maybe it's the fountain gets them a little...

1738
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:15,810
Um...

1739
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:16,630
Sorry.

1740
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:17,690
Sorry, Serenity.

1741
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:19,030
Serenity now!

1742
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,790
Oops.

1743
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:23,190
Maybe it's the fountain gets them a little dizzy.

1744
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:32,140
Add lemon.

1745
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,140
Yep.

1746
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,700
What happens if you let them drown?

1747
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:37,340
Um, they die.

1748
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:39,080
Yeah, they die for real.

1749
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:42,060
I wouldn't know that from experience.

1750
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,140
It's an educated guess.

1751
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,960
I would not know that from experience, of course.

1752
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,520
They die, IRL.

1753
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,260
These are all real people.

1754
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,720
Ki-hi-hi-hi-hora!

1755
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,820
Wait, we have to make sure she lives.

1756
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:05,300
Ki-wawa!

1757
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:07,240
Ki-wawa, ki-wawa, ki-wawa.

1758
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,000
Chihuahua!

1759
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,480
Chihuahua, are you ready for a good time?

1760
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:12,840
Oh, yeah, girl!

1761
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,980
Oh, yeah, girl!

1762
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:15,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1763
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,260
Let's follow her into the bathroom.

1764
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:22,180
I didn't think we would actually be able to.

1765
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,820
This one's for you, KFP!

1766
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:31,980
Oh.

1767
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,340
Add ice.

1768
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:42,280
We have to make sure she has the bathroom.

1769
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,540
Best time ever.

1770
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,320
Nice.

1771
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:48,500
Nice to buy!

1772
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:49,760
Get in there!

1773
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:51,800
Is there trash?

1774
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,880
I thought he said it was trashy.

1775
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,020
Maybe not.

1776
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,080
Where'd she go?

1777
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:56,600
Kiara?

1778
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,120
Kiwawa!

1779
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,340
Kiwawa!

1780
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,100
Kiwawa!

1781
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:03,660
Oh, oh.

1782
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:05,900
Hot dog and lemon and...

1783
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:07,580
Add ice.

1784
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:09,740
Yep.

1785
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,400
And you add both.

1786
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,080
Mm-mm.

1787
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:13,580
Okay.

1788
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,220
Idol meeting admission fee.

1789
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:18,780
Who's

1790
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,980
making all these sounds?

1791
01:44:28,350 --> 01:44:29,510
Guys, we lost her.

1792
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,170
I don't know where Kiara went.

1793
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:37,160
Wawa, where?

1794
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:38,780
Wawa?

1795
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:39,800
Kiwawa?

1796
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,380
Did she have the most fun ever?

1797
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,060
That river.

1798
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:47,220
I would recognize her bathing suit.

1799
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:49,080
Kiara?

1800
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:54,470
Where did she go?

1801
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:54,930
she go?

1802
01:44:58,270 --> 01:44:59,190
I just gave her a hot dog.

1803
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:00,330
Oh, she was the one who ordered?

1804
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:07,870
I feel like I've seen something that I'm going to be obligated to forget, or I'll spend eternity in the usual

1805
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:11,770
room.

1806
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:13,450
Serenity, now!

1807
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,610
Serenity, ow, ow, ow!

1808
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:31,990
These are probably pretty clean though.

1809
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:32,330
Wow!

1810
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:35,250
Victor does a good job keeping things clean.

1811
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,940
Most of these just need, like, a little sprucing up, but he's maintaining this well.

1812
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,200
Yes, he is.

1813
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,320
If only I could get a repair, man.

1814
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,760
I mean, how many people are going to be paying by...

1815
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,280
Cash, right?

1816
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:04,300
It could be that...

1817
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,540
Most people pay by card, and we only...

1818
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:09,760
If I get rid of Braylon, we only need to go up a couple times, you know?

1819
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,160
Perhaps.

1820
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:22,750
You guys see the 6-7?

1821
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:29,780
I hate these zoomers in my park.

1822
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:32,420
This is an adult-only park.

1823
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,160
From now on.

1824
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,220
Clear grip.

1825
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:36,500
Oh!

1826
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:42,760
I didn't even see this.

1827
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,420
Oh, graffiti.

1828
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:45,240
Wow, that was hard to see.

1829
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:50,380
Adult swim.

1830
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:51,960
for real.

1831
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:56,800
Okay, grandma.

1832
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,300
These dying youngsters!

1833
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,260
Graffiti ain't my part!

1834
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,740
I don't know what's wrong with blue hoodies.

1835
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:09,220
I don't really get it.

1836
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:11,100
That one is a mystery.

1837
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:12,300
A true mystery to me.

1838
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:17,380
Oh!

1839
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:20,800
I...

1840
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,360
Sui!

1841
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,380
Sui sei.

1842
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:28,740
I think it's a Kaiso joke?

1843
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,520
Graffiti.

1844
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,260
Graffiti everywhere.

1845
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:37,420
Sui-chan?

1846
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,700
Hiyo mo kawaii?

1847
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:44,220
Alright, so we need to restock stuff.

1848
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,240
I think I cleaned everything.

1849
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,120
Oh, wait.

1850
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,240
Can you do a super cool 360 spin?

1851
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,340
Okay.

1852
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,280
How was that?

1853
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,000
I think that was pretty sick.

1854
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,420
Thanks for the teeny tiny pretzel recommend.

1855
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,180
They are indeed yummy.

1856
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:13,380
Oh, you went out and got some already?

1857
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:14,720
So fast.

1858
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:18,280
Yes, everybody get your teeny tiny pretzels.

1859
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,040
Not sponsored, obviously.

1860
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,280
Everybody do the flop.

1861
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:26,680
I'm not flopping.

1862
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,360
I think that's everything.

1863
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,020
Now let's do the ATM.

1864
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:40,460
Okay.

1865
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,660
Where would that be under though?

1866
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,920
Uh, not here.

1867
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:46,640
Maintenance?

1868
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:00,460
Oh, ticket machine!

1869
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:02,640
Oh, the way here?

1870
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:05,920
Unlocks a ticket machine.

1871
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:06,240
Okay.

1872
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,180
That was my post-stream activity last night.

1873
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,040
Let's go!

1874
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:15,420
Ticket... Okay, well now...

1875
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:18,000
My tickets will be more expensive, so that's good too.

1876
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,020
We got a ticket machine!

1877
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,440
Where is it?

1878
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,120
Do I have to build it?

1879
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:36,020
And we got more decorations too.

1880
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:38,680
Big tree.

1881
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,020
Let's put in a big tree right.

1882
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:45,160
Right here.

1883
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,460
Some atmosphere.

1884
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,700
Oh yeah baby.

1885
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,500
That's what the people want.

1886
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:56,300
I want like some like statues and stuff.

1887
01:49:58,980 --> 01:49:59,860
Right next to the ducky?

1888
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:01,940
Ah, I see!

1889
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:03,240
Thank you.

1890
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:04,940
Nice, nice, nice.

1891
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:07,680
Raelin, are you sleeping with me tonight?

1892
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:08,700
Oh.

1893
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:10,160
Oop.

1894
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:13,500
My tiny, my tiny, my tiny trash.

1895
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:13,720
Wait!

1896
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:15,340
Pick up my t- No!

1897
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:16,240
No!

1898
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:26,940
It will let- I think we cleaned everything.

1899
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,420
Oh wait, let me build this.

1900
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:34,740
Wow!

1901
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,300
Look at this!

1902
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,180
This is a snazzy park, huh?

1903
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,940
I littered, yeah, right outside my home.

1904
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,700
Maybe I'll be able to get it in the morning.

1905
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,680
A flock of seagulls.

1906
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:47,080
No.

1907
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:48,800
No.

1908
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:51,980
No.

1909
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:58,600
Okay, Victor, we got our work cut out for us today.

1910
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,580
Oh, I got a restock.

1911
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,440
Oh, this one.

1912
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:15,860
You have Victor now.

1913
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,000
Yeah, it'll be easier.

1914
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:23,820
Eh?

1915
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:25,460
Huh?

1916
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,440
Oh, this is a hot dog.

1917
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,420
Um, this one... I think the other one was more empty.

1918
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,160
Honestly, I couldn't tell.

1919
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:37,600
They seem about the same.

1920
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,200
Of course they're saving all their shit for when we open.

1921
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,960
Let's get another trash bag and let's open up, baby.

1922
01:51:58,770 --> 01:52:00,690
Now our tickets are more expensive.

1923
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:01,570
Okay, wait.

1924
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:05,110
So now the road to three stars sell 50 tickets!

1925
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:07,230
Okay.

1926
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:14,350
Hello?

1927
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:16,410
Theme park?

1928
01:52:16,670 --> 01:52:17,290
No?

1929
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:17,950
Theme park?

1930
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:18,790
No?

1931
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:21,210
Um, theme park?

1932
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:21,850
Theme park?

1933
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:24,370
Seagulls are leaving a mess.

1934
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:29,770
Where?

1935
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:31,170
Where?

1936
01:52:31,970 --> 01:52:32,310
Here.

1937
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:36,410
One lemon dog, please.

1938
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,690
Turbo, thank you so much for the beat that rat!

1939
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:46,930
Oh my god.

1940
01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:47,750
Oh, there's...

1941
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,190
There's poop everywhere!

1942
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:51,130
Victor, help me!

1943
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:57,070
How did they get underneath the...

1944
01:52:58,230 --> 01:52:59,190
Oh, they're gone.

1945
01:53:00,670 --> 01:53:02,170
I'll leave the rest to you, Victor.

1946
01:53:03,870 --> 01:53:05,930
Okay, I gotta go pass out these flyers.

1947
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:10,010
Someone's waiting for a hot dog.

1948
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:13,530
Best day ever, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

1949
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:17,450
Thank you so much for the gift and you guys!

1950
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:24,930
Thank you, thank you, sorry, I am so preoccupied with the birds.

1951
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:26,230
The birds.

1952
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:31,010
Oh, you already won one, okay.

1953
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:32,190
What about you?

1954
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:35,730
No, meh!

1955
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,280
Everybody's still doing good here?

1956
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:50,460
Phil, thank you!

1957
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,640
Poop everywhere.

1958
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,220
Can I get a lemonade?

1959
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,540
I want lemonade for real.

1960
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,320
Oh, lemonade.

1961
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:06,560
I want real lemonade.

1962
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,220
I want lemonade now, actually.

1963
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:11,100
Can I get a lemonade?

1964
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:12,740
Poop.

1965
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:21,630
No poop park.

1966
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:28,270
We're a very clean, satisfying place to be.

1967
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:34,430
Yeah.

1968
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,840
There's not poop everywhere.

1969
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:45,080
You're too old for this.

1970
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:47,220
You are way too old for this, Willow.

1971
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,320
You're like a grandma.

1972
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:49,960
My fault.

1973
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,000
I'll let the boys know not to poop at your park.

1974
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:56,440
Thank you for the pink.

1975
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:57,140
Thank

1976
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:00,750
you.

1977
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:04,150
Oh, oh, oh.

1978
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:07,810
Six.

1979
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:08,770
Oh, oh.

1980
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:09,610
Oh, my gosh.

1981
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:10,770
Oh, oh.

1982
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:12,830
Someone's angry.

1983
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:14,190
I mean, not angry, drowning.

1984
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:14,810
There you go.

1985
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:15,590
You're safe now.

1986
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:17,750
What are you?

1987
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:18,990
Why are you guys?

1988
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:20,150
I said it was... Oh, no.

1989
01:55:20,230 --> 01:55:20,930
She says it's clean.

1990
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:21,990
I thought she said it was dirty.

1991
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:27,890
What?

1992
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:31,970
Haha.

1993
01:55:36,220 --> 01:55:38,400
Ice, lemon, dozo.

1994
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:43,500
They're angry because they're drowning, obviously.

1995
01:55:48,000 --> 01:56:02,200
sparkle sparkle yes yes yes that's what we like to see here yes yes yes i don't know okay i think he just cleaned that very good what's going on in there oh wow

1996
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:43,510
i think so i see someone drowning hold on let me just clean this stuff in the tub sorry So far, no one's died.

1997
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:44,490
That's so impressive.

1998
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:48,390
Did you just kiss me because I saved you?

1999
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:51,590
Ow, that was it.

2000
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:53,470
Oh, someone's waiting for Lemon.

2001
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:58,420
Add Lemon.

2002
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:05,510
Minto was flabbergasted.

2003
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:07,350
That was crazy.

2004
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:10,630
I did not expect Vectors even in the pool.

2005
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:13,370
I didn't expect...

2006
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:15,290
And then did you hear he, like...

2007
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:18,390
It was like a satisfying little...

2008
01:57:19,650 --> 01:57:21,170
After they were done!

2009
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:27,170
Nobody dying should be the bare minimum.

2010
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:28,610
Who's taking photos?

2011
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:36,360
We got perbs here taking photos of people in their swimsuits.

2012
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,120
Who's taking a photo?

2013
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:49,700
What happened?

2014
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,420
Maybe he saw a ghost.

2015
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,700
Why are you taking photos?

2016
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,820
You caught a pervert!

2017
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,900
Oh, Serenity!

2018
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:01,840
Serenity!

2019
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,320
Serenity!

2020
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,820
Give Serenity my number.

2021
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:29,860
You're okay, Holly.

2022
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:32,520
Didn't notice your legs bugging out at all.

2023
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:35,200
Don't worry about it.

2024
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:36,600
That was...

2025
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,620
This is craziness.

2026
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:42,020
I said she was... I said there was a pervert and it was real!

2027
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:45,420
Sorry, Victor.

2028
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:47,940
Your opinion matters less, though.

2029
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,380
She's turning on her own people, perverts.

2030
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,720
I mean, I'll

2031
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:03,280
look past it next time, you know?

2032
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:06,760
Serenity, come back, you know?

2033
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,900
It's like, oh, this isn't, no, this is Serenity.

2034
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:11,680
Serenity, you're my girl.

2035
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:12,660
Here.

2036
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:15,280
You get the pervert pass.

2037
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:17,560
Don't worry about it.

2038
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,520
Yeah, don't worry about it.

2039
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:27,660
We're selling, okay, we're almost to 25, we're almost halfway to the numbers of tickets we need to sell.

2040
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,740
Someone's waiting for...

2041
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,420
We're making okay money, okay.

2042
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:40,950
Uh, add lemon.

2043
01:59:43,170 --> 01:59:43,690
You're welcome.

2044
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:46,770
Stinky garbage, stinky garbage!

2045
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:55,950
Clean 1,000 trash in your park.

2046
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:56,870
Let's go.

2047
01:59:58,290 --> 01:59:59,850
Um, any graffiti around?

2048
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:01,590
Oh, guess who's waiting?

2049
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:04,670
Stinky, Minky, no!

2050
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:07,270
Teen, for four hours, slide pass.

2051
02:00:08,290 --> 02:00:09,010
Hello, y'all!

2052
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:10,830
Well, you don't...

2053
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:11,770
I guess you're a teenager.

2054
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:13,170
You don't have a card, probably.

2055
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:16,250
I feel like most teenagers have cards nowadays, no?

2056
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:19,430
Stinky, Stinky!

2057
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:23,170
Center pool is nasty.

2058
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:24,370
No, it's not nasty.

2059
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:25,630
It needs to be repaired.

2060
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:26,610
Oh, my bad.

2061
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:28,010
Who is that?

2062
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:28,690
Serenity?

2063
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:29,990
Okay, she kind of deserved it.

2064
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:35,130
Serenity, girl!

2065
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:37,110
Found out.

2066
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:47,050
She's like, maybe if I make like a big bus her people will like you know, try and help me and I can you know, touch them.

2067
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:51,510
She wants to grab onto some big biceps.

2068
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:54,230
Hello, Christopher.

2069
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:56,950
What the lemon?

2070
02:00:57,670 --> 02:00:58,370
Of course.

2071
02:00:59,110 --> 02:00:59,410
Yep.

2072
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:03,430
Bandle.

2073
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:05,830
At the stars.

2074
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:10,650
Whoa, six.

2075
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:12,730
Oh, I ripped my pants.

2076
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:13,830
Do you guys see that?

2077
02:01:14,910 --> 02:01:16,190
How embarrassing.

2078
02:01:17,030 --> 02:01:19,070
Oh my god, I hope nobody saw.

2079
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:23,030
I did a split.

2080
02:01:23,190 --> 02:01:53,690
ripped my pants when I ripped my pants I thought everybody was on my side but I went and blew it all sky high the photos are on the house yeah we do a weekly or monthly calendar or something now she won't even spare a passing glance all just because I ripped my pants.

2081
02:01:54,730 --> 02:01:58,370
Big Larry can't run just to put him down.

2082
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:01,970
Peep, peep, poo, poo on the potty.

2083
02:02:02,410 --> 02:02:09,670
No one ever wants to dance with the fool and then ripped his pants.

2084
02:02:09,910 --> 02:02:11,370

2085

2087
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:25,090
Oh, sorry, Victor.

2088
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:25,890

02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:26,970
You got this one, King.

2090
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:27,950
Someone dying?

02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:32,630
Oh, someone is dying.

2094
02:02:33,730 --> 02:02:34,550
I got you.

2095
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:36,770
Don't die on me.

2096
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:38,110
Amanda, please.

2097
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:39,190
Life or death here.

2098
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:55,530
Why is SpongeBob music so good?

2099
02:02:55,630 --> 02:02:56,650
What was I coming out here for?

2100
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:57,310
I don't remember.

2101
02:03:00,510 --> 02:03:01,270
Stinky, stinky.

2102
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:07,450
The owner sucks!

2103
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:12,530
Restock, I guess so.

2104
02:03:12,690 --> 02:03:14,750
Do I need to re- Oh, I think I need to restock the lemon in.

2105
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:18,250
Or I'm close to it.

2106
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:22,370
Add both.

2107
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:23,910
Yes.

2108
02:03:26,170 --> 02:03:27,270
Yes, yes, yes.

2109
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:30,750
We're almost out of granola bars, which is awesome.

2110
02:03:32,370 --> 02:03:32,930
Okay.

2111
02:03:32,950 --> 02:03:34,470
Means we're making so much money on them.

2112
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:36,790
Oh, sorry.

2113
02:03:38,770 --> 02:03:39,810
Plateral damage.

2114
02:03:41,970 --> 02:03:43,010
And close!

2115
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:44,810
Almost.

2116
02:03:45,850 --> 02:03:47,250
Sneaky, stinky person.

2117
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,840
Graylin wrote that after you bought the vending machine.

2118
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:11,420
Okay, I can't find a trash bin, thought.

2119
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:12,260
Really?

2120
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:13,960
Do I need to add more trash bins?

2121
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,360
Okay, we can put one like here.

2122
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:28,750
No, how do I turn the camera?

2123
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:34,190
How do I rotate?

2124
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:38,030
Do I rotate?

2125
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:39,610
Can't remember.

2126
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:40,690
Uh.

2127
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:42,990
Shift?

2128
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:43,630
No.

2129
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:45,050
No.

2130
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:46,190
Q?

2131
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:47,670
Oh, thank you.

2132
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:50,290
Oh, I see a QE.

2133
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:50,930
You're right.

2134
02:04:52,070 --> 02:04:52,830
I'm blind.

2135
02:04:54,410 --> 02:04:55,510
I'll put it right.

2136
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:55,950
I'll put it right here.

2137
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:59,670
And then we can put another one

2138
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:09,960
Over here Okay

2139
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:37,510

02:05:44,330 --> 02:05:44,890
I

2142
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:59,640
feel like we clean way more than like other places do.

2143
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:00,520
You know what I mean?

2144
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:02,420
Like other water parks.

2145
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,640
I feel like we're held to a very high standard.

2146
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,280
Everything is coming together nicely.

2147
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:08,980
Yes, yes.

2148
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:16,450
People are dirty, dirty nasties.

2149
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:30,010
we also repair more I know but to be fair our bathrooms get broken in like two seconds for some reason

2150
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:38,580
Kobe 7 out of 10 come on

2151
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:49,660

2152

02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:17,340
Yeah, this rocks.

2203
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:18,960
Boring!

2204
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,080
My bad.

2205
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:21,740
I'm not the owner.

2206
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:22,420
Talk to Breland.

2207
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:33,720
Welcome to the park!

2208
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:38,220
It's so clean and beautiful, anyone lemonade!

2209
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,460
I had lemon.

2210
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:44,360
Of course.

2211
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:48,640
What did he just...

2212
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:56,720
I get $30 for catching the perverts.

2213
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:00,160
If you catch me, you guys won't get that.

2214
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:00,460
$30.

2215
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:02,080
I'll just let you know now.

2216
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:09,790
Yeah, get out of here.

2217
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:19,740
Unfair.

2218
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:21,380
But do we get a minto?

2219
02:11:22,340 --> 02:11:23,000
I don't know.

2220
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,380
I'm a little slippery.

2221
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:32,400
Okay.

2222
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:34,620
Good, good, good.

2223
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:35,460
How many tickets?

2224
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:35,940
40!

2225
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:37,180
We just need five more!

2226
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:37,940
Five more!

2227
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,060
Stinky, stinky, stinky!

2228
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:43,540
Stinky, Jacob!

2229
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:47,060
Like an eel, exactly.

2230
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:56,920
Oh, stinky.

2231
02:11:57,120 --> 02:11:58,540
Many stinkies today.

2232
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,280
I wonder if that's going to be our next thing to do.

2233
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:03,640
They're the stinkies.

2234
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:11,860
Ghost eel.

2235
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:12,600
What the heck?

2236
02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:13,540
So many stinkies.

2237
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:16,920
Do you think my park is a shower?

2238
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:17,900
What is up with this?

2239
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:19,680
Okay.

2240
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:20,440
Uh, lemonade.

2241
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:22,420
Add lemon.

2242
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,620
No bin in sight!

2243
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:27,980
Ma'am, your glasses!

2244
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:36,380
Why are you saying it's trashy when you did that?

2245
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:38,600
And now you don't want to go in the-

2246
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,380
I don't even see the trash, though.

2247
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:45,180
More stinky.

2248
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:48,840
People piss in the pools.

2249
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:49,540
Not here.

2250
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:50,900
Maybe a little.

2251
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:51,500
I don't know.

2252
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:54,140
We...

2253
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:55,520
We clean, we clean!

2254
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:58,920
Maybe that's why everything gets so dirty so fast.

2255
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:02,840
Maybe.

2256
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:06,940
Jacob is waiting.

2257
02:13:10,660 --> 02:13:11,000
Lemonade.

2258
02:13:12,340 --> 02:13:12,480
Yep.

2259
02:13:14,740 --> 02:13:15,760
Kiara's back!

2260
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:21,300
She said no?

2261
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,420
Oh, okay, good.

2262
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:26,420
Wow, what's her hot dog playing, everybody?

2263
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:27,700
Write it down.

2264
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,180
Write it down.

2265
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:31,420
Add ketchup.

2266
02:13:37,670 --> 02:13:39,030
Wow, wow.

2267
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:40,470
Lemon.

2268
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:41,350
Ice.

2269
02:13:43,830 --> 02:13:44,250
Very good.

2270
02:13:44,450 --> 02:13:44,930
Very good.

2271
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:46,350
Any trash?

2272
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:47,990
No trash?

2273
02:13:49,490 --> 02:13:50,790
Any trash here?

2274
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:52,910
Oh, there is trash here.

2275
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:56,310
Okay, one moment.

2276
02:13:56,450 --> 02:13:57,510

Exactly.

2280

Mm-hmm.

2281
02:14:38,930 --> 02:14:39,570
Uh-oh.

2282
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:40,270
Someone's dying.

2283
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,060
I got it.

2284
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:46,040
I'm too good.

2285
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,040
Don't slip.

2286
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:49,340
Don't slip.

2287
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:51,880
Jacob.

2288
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:53,960
Jacob is panicking on the diving board.

2289
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:56,180
Oh!

2290
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:58,060
Two lateral damage.

2291
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:10,270
Anybody waiting?

2292
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:10,690
Nope?

2293
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:11,050
Okay.

2294
02:15:13,370 --> 02:15:17,610
Any water to wa- Hudson full of energy.

2295
02:15:20,990 --> 02:15:21,450
Nice dive.

2296
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:22,550
Thank you, 10 points!

2297
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:23,070
Yahoo!

2298
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:29,210
Oh wait, build five trash bins with at least two star prestige.

2299
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:33,890
Okay, so that's our next task list is to build more trash cans.

2300
02:15:34,650 --> 02:15:35,630
I feel like I could do that.

2301
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:37,690
I want to wait until after the...

2302
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:41,910
The park is closed, you know?

2303
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:45,770
It's hard to build stuff when it's open.

2304
02:15:45,890 --> 02:15:47,390
There's always so much going on.

2305
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:51,670
But at the same time, I want to get more task stuff.

2306
02:15:52,030 --> 02:15:53,290
I want to get another task.

2307
02:15:58,170 --> 02:15:58,690
Let's...

2308
02:15:58,690 --> 02:16:00,990
We'll have Victor handle everything.

2309
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:04,670
If somebody dies...

2310
02:16:04,670 --> 02:16:06,050
It's not our fault.

2311
02:16:06,170 --> 02:16:07,070
It's Victor's fault.

2312
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:18,440
It seems like they come in waves.

2313
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:27,820
Today we have a bunch of litterers and some days we have a bunch of we have a bunch of graffiti people.

2314
02:16:31,860 --> 02:16:32,660
Let's go!

2315
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:33,220
Yeah!

2316
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:34,960
What's happening?

2317
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:42,710
He's gonna fall asleep again.

2318
02:16:46,090 --> 02:16:48,850
Oh yeah, because we have so many illiterate...

2319
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:49,730
Okay, let's add them.

2320
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:51,550
Utility.

2321
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:54,330
We don't have a two-star prestige.

2322
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:56,430
We have to unlock it.

2323
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:01,590
Maintenance?

2324
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:04,310
Trash, highlight, no.

2325
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:07,410
Modern toilets, no.

2326
02:17:08,430 --> 02:17:08,770
Arc.

2327
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:13,810
Modern trash bins.

2328
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:14,330
Here we go.

2329
02:17:16,530 --> 02:17:17,470
Hungry guests.

2330
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:19,710
Okay, so that's vendor staff we can now get.

2331
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:21,130
But we need the modern trash bins.

2332
02:17:21,270 --> 02:17:21,770
There we go.

2333
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:25,730
Now we're doing...

2334
02:17:25,730 --> 02:17:27,610
Oh, I should get rid of these ones then.

2335
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:28,570
Alright.

2336
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:29,970
Sledgehammer time.

2337
02:17:32,510 --> 02:17:32,890
Coming!

2338
02:17:34,490 --> 02:17:35,030
Teen.

2339
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:36,730
Pass.

2340
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:38,530
Six hours.

2341
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:41,770
You're welcome.

2342
02:17:45,350 --> 02:17:45,470
Sledgehammer.

02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:51,350

Yo yo.

2348
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:36,720
The

2349
02:18:40,290 --> 02:18:43,390
trash can guy will complain they're not optimized.

2350
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:44,310
It's okay.

2351
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:48,830
We'll optimize them to his standards.

2352
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:51,730
We will.

2353
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:53,550
We'll optimize them.

2354
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:55,070
Add ice.

2355
02:18:58,810 --> 02:18:59,350
Yo, yo.

2356
02:19:00,350 --> 02:19:03,030

02:19:03,970 --> 02:19:05,490
I was just about to get that.

2359
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:08,970
This one, too.

2360
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:10,950
More lemonade!

2361
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:13,070
Oh, no, I'm about to run out, though.

2362
02:19:15,710 --> 02:19:15,950
Oh!

2363
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,240
Everything's fine.

2364
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:32,620
Uh-oh.

2365
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:33,820
We're out.

2366
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:34,760
One moment.

2367
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:41,240
Serenity, how are you at the park again?

2368
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:42,280
How are you not on a list?

2369
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:47,570
How are you welcome back here?

2370
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:53,380
Matthew is drowning.

2371
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:55,480
Palmer is drowning.

2372
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:56,640
Everybody is drowning.

2373
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,500
My pools are safe, I promise.

2374
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:07,720
Excellent question.

2375
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:09,840
Yeah, like just how...

2376
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,160
Who's letting you back in?

2377
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:15,640
She's on the VIP list.

2378
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:26,180
Do you want to live, Kairi?

2379
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,320
Kairi, Kingdom Hearts fame?

2380
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:37,090
Sorry, we're out of Lemonade, and it's 5.30.

2381
02:20:48,850 --> 02:20:50,950
I think Ben drowned.

2382
02:20:53,010 --> 02:20:53,870
Park is haunted.

2383
02:20:54,010 --> 02:20:54,610
It makes sense.

2384
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,440
What was that, Matthew?

2385
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:13,520
We're going together.

2386
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:16,540
I'm stuck.

2387
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:18,400
There we go.

2388
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:25,060
Matthew was once again panicking on the...

2389
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:25,300
Okay.

2390
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:27,780
Panic at the diving board?

2391
02:21:28,580 --> 02:21:29,020
I got you.

2392
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:29,740
I got you.

2393
02:21:33,460 --> 02:21:33,800
Okay.

2394
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:36,960
Let's build some more trash cans.

2395
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:39,740
Let's get rid of these.

2396
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:43,400
A sledgehammer.

2397
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:46,820
God.

2398
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:47,860
Damn it, Matthew.

2399
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,620
He's such a little weenie.

2400
02:21:57,950 --> 02:21:59,530
Panic at the diving board.

2401
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:01,730
My favorite band.

2402
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:06,810
Alright, that alone will be enough.

2403
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:12,520
Or wait.

2404
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:15,040
I deleted...

2405
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:16,440
Yeah, there we go.

2406
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:17,540
This was the last one.

2407
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:21,520
There we go.

2408
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:23,060
Okay.

2409
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:24,640
Let's build them.

2410
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:29,660
They have a bigger range too?

2411
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:30,320
Oh!

2412
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:37,080
Empty your trash bins.

2413
02:22:42,610 --> 02:22:43,830
Okay, that did count.

2414
02:22:44,090 --> 02:22:47,830
Unfortunately, that was the only one that had anything in it.

2415
02:22:50,530 --> 02:22:51,530
Let's go restock.

2416
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:56,740
Welcome to Kmart.

2417
02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:58,300
What?

2418
02:22:58,500 --> 02:22:59,480
I know he is lemonade.

2419
02:22:59,900 --> 02:23:01,860
Let's check how we are on hot dogs.

2420
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:09,170
Yeah, we'll...

2421
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:11,170
We'll get it.

2422
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:19,100
And granola bars.

2423
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,420
We have a good amount of money though!

2424
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:22,060
Wow!

2425
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:24,180
Guys, we're killing it!

2426
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,420
We're killing it with the profits!

2427
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,520
Now we have to repair everything.

2428
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:42,810
Doesn't count all the other times we did it?

2429
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:44,290
No, unfortunately.

2430
02:23:46,270 --> 02:23:51,430
Luckily, we don't have to clean everything so much because Victor does a great job.

2431
02:23:56,810 --> 02:23:57,090
Granola.

2432
02:23:57,470 --> 02:24:04,990
I know we've started swimming in cash since we, ever since we got the vending machines, life has been good.

2433
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:17,810
No graffiti.

2434
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:27,020
We're repairing everything.

2435
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,880
Repair, repair, repair, repair.

2436
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,400
What about this one?

2437
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:35,940
We'll buy more granola.

2438
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:40,920
It's making me rich after all.

2439
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:43,320
The people are addicted to granola.

2440
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,620
They want the granola.

2441
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:47,160
They feed on it.

2442
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:49,660
I mean, they actually do because you eat it.

2443
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:52,540
They hunger for the granola.

2444
02:25:03,770 --> 02:25:05,430
They need the grain.

2445
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:08,270
Me in the morning when I want my oatmeal.

2446
02:25:09,130 --> 02:25:10,330
I need the grain!

2447
02:25:10,610 --> 02:25:12,010
I hunger for grain!

2448
02:25:13,490 --> 02:25:14,930
Did I get this slide?

2449
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:17,270
Yes.

2450
02:25:17,810 --> 02:25:19,730
Oh, this chair over here, the hidden one.

2451
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:22,210
He even cleaned that!

2452
02:25:22,310 --> 02:25:22,650
Victor!

2453
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:23,570
You're so good!

2454
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:27,930
Well, because we did all the other...

2455
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:32,950
other trash cans and we already emptied this one.

2456
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:37,130
I guess it would have been better to...

2457
02:25:40,610 --> 02:25:47,130
to uh keep them and just build new ones but oh well

2458
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:54,600
okay sleep

2459
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:14,140
why is this game so addicting I don't know how to describe it you guys it's just so it just scratches such an itch it's like oh I go to this place oh I do this thing oh I do that thing it just scratches such a good itch May I have some oats?

2460
02:26:15,360 --> 02:26:16,040
Here, my son.

2461
02:26:22,230 --> 02:26:22,970
The rush?

2462
02:26:23,390 --> 02:26:23,430
Maybe.

2463
02:26:24,370 --> 02:26:25,490
It is a good rush.

2464
02:26:26,670 --> 02:26:28,230
It keeps me really stimulated.

2465
02:26:28,570 --> 02:26:29,610
I said that last time.

2466
02:26:29,770 --> 02:26:30,770
And I'll say it again.

2467
02:26:33,130 --> 02:26:34,870
I said it last time!

2468
02:26:35,250 --> 02:26:36,690
And I meant it.

2469
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:44,360
Oh, sorry, Braylon.

2470
02:26:54,310 --> 02:26:55,450
You, you, you, you, you.

2471
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:56,830
Oh, you already wanted a ticket.

2472
02:26:57,890 --> 02:27:00,390
You already love me, you're already obsessed with me.

2473
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,770
What about you?

2474
02:27:04,690 --> 02:27:06,050
Best day ever, exactly.

2475
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:12,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2476
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:13,180
Wait, is that Serenity?

2477
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:14,460
Oh, God damn it.

2478
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:16,820
We're the one inviting her back.

2479
02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:30,440
We keep letting her into the park!

2480
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:32,420
Oh, my God.

2481
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:33,960
We're the bad guys.

2482
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,400
We keep letting this pervert in the park!

2483
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,180
Oh my god!

2484
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:50,380
Oh no!

2485
02:27:52,040 --> 02:27:52,420
Oh!

2486
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:57,160
Dang, I get $44 for catching a pervert.

2487
02:27:58,600 --> 02:27:59,500
That's huge.

2488
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:00,640
That's big money.

2489
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:01,440
Kiera!

2490
02:28:05,970 --> 02:28:07,850
You owe me one kiss.

2491
02:28:18,520 --> 02:28:19,880
We'll get her someday, but...

2492
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:30,600
Okay, even the non-full trash, like emptying the non-full trash counts, so that is good to know.

2493
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:32,260
We can kind of make it fast.

2494
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:33,840
We can speedrun it a little bit.

2495
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:38,340
Letting him into the park so he can catch him is good money.

2496
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:40,700
True.

2497
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:43,640
It's a little bit of a hack.

2498
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:45,960
Oh, I didn't get more granola.

2499
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:48,320
Oh, no, there's no more granola.

2500
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:49,220
Or there's one left.

2501
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Victor, what were you doing over there?

2502
02:28:58,080 --> 02:28:59,600
Kiara's waiting for a hot dog.

2503
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:01,620
I won't let you wait.

2504
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:03,680
I see you.

2505
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:08,500
I'm both.

2506
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:11,700
She's being adventurous today.

2507
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:16,360
Where was that guy?

2508
02:29:18,740 --> 02:29:20,240
Who had no wristband.

2509
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:22,020
Where?

2510
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,420
Where is a pervert?

2511
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:24,920
I heard him.

2512
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:33,620
She's a bit shy.

2513
02:29:34,660 --> 02:29:37,680
You should remove the lemonade and fill up with granola machines.

2514
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:40,280
The hot dog stand is non-negotiable.

2515
02:29:42,440 --> 02:29:44,060
But the people are thirsty.

2516
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:50,260
The people demand their thirst to be quenched.

2517
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,380
Oh, look at all these people getting nasty.

2518
02:29:56,660 --> 02:29:57,300
Oh, yeah.

2519
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:58,160
Oh, yeah.

2520
02:29:58,280 --> 02:29:58,600
Oh, yeah.

2521
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:00,960
Oh, yeah.

2522
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:04,760
I heard another camera.

2523
02:30:12,220 --> 02:30:13,240
Where's the pervert?

2524
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:14,540
Where's the pervert?

2525
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:16,500
Oh, no.

2526
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:18,280
I'm right here.

2527
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,440
No, Bev.

2528
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:23,340
No, the people need Bev.

2529
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:27,400
Don't sweat.

2530
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:32,300
Bottom right.

2531
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:33,200
Damn, Victor.

2532
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:34,700
Come on, let a girl shower.

2533
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:39,060
Golly!

2534
02:30:45,730 --> 02:30:46,930
Red shorts guy?

2535
02:30:47,790 --> 02:30:48,390
Where?

2536
02:30:53,140 --> 02:30:54,220
Uh-oh.

2537
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:54,680
Uh-oh.

2538
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:55,160
Uh-oh.

2539
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:57,720
Add lemon.

2540
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:04,600
Waited too long for lemonade.

2541
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:05,420
What are you talking about?

2542
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:06,640
What do you want?

2543
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:07,040
Oh, lemon.

2544
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:11,820
Victor's showering out with my patrons.

2545
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:13,360
Sorry!

2546
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:22,640
Okay, just...

2547
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:23,100
Just one more?

2548
02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:23,600
This one!

2549
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:24,160
Nice!

2550
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:28,820
Alright, what's our next task?

2551
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,440
Build two out of three showers at least one prestige.

2552
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:33,000
Okay, we got...

2553
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:33,800
Or...

2554
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:34,660
We have two.

2555
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:36,420
We just need to build one more shower.

2556
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:37,080
You know what?

2557
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:39,840
Let's build it like right over here because we don't have any over here.

2558
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:44,200
Is this at least one prestige?

2559
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:44,460
Yeah.

2560
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:44,860
Okay.

2561
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:47,300
So like right here maybe?

2562
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:49,060
It's kind of far out of the way.

2563
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:49,880
Maybe here.

2564
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:53,900
like going all the way over there.

2565
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:56,620
There we go.

2566
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:04,320
Place a vending machine.

2567
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:05,440
Yeah, I have it.

2568
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:09,000
Sell snacks via your vending machine.

2569
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:09,680
Okay, okay.

2570
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:12,500
Now we have to wait for vending machines to sales.

2571
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:18,160
And then we're good to go.

2572
02:32:18,600 --> 02:32:19,320
Purve at the showers.

2573
02:32:21,160 --> 02:32:21,740
Is it me?

2574
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:24,440
It's not me.

2575
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:25,760
Wait, is this our purves?

2576
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:26,660

2593
02:33:19,380 --> 02:33:20,500

Hold on, everybody.

2598
02:34:10,830 --> 02:34:11,670
The pool is broken.

2599

2600
02:34:12,950 --> 02:34:14,230
Don't use it and break your necks.

2601
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:15,290
That would be really upsetting.

2602
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:16,730
Wait, it had to be that one.

2603
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:17,690

Add lemon.

02:36:13,430 --> 02:36:14,150

2651
02:37:47,810 --> 02:37:48,750
Three more granolas.

2652
02:37:55,110 --> 02:37:57,010
We ain't rich yet.

2653
02:37:57,130 --> 02:37:58,070
What are you talking about?

2654
02:37:58,170 --> 02:38:01,470
This could buy us a whole new tent.

2655
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:05,590
Hot dog!

2656
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:09,430
Eevee, my savior.

2657
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:16,170

2660
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:42,940
Another job well done.

2661
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:44,940
That might be the best ever at this game.

2662
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:49,820
Akira!

2663
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:53,790
Thank you so much for that.

2664
02:38:54,310 --> 02:38:56,090
Might be able to buy 18 eggs.

2665
02:38:56,710 --> 02:38:57,330
Let's go?

2666
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:01,790
We need to sell more snacks though.

2667
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:04,270
We need the people craving granola.

2668
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:06,290
Alright, it's time to put cocaine in it.

2669
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:13,360
If Coca-Cola can do it, so can we.

2670
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:15,080
Any graffiti?

2671
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:15,740
No?

2672
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:21,340
The

2673
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:26,820
people will yearn for granola.

2674
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:31,320
The people will yearn for the granola!

2675
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:41,950
Extra crunchy.

2676
02:39:48,870 --> 02:39:54,130
It does do, Victor does do a great job at making it so that things don't take as long to clean, for sure.

2677
02:39:55,570 --> 02:39:56,590
This one looks pretty dirty.

2678
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:02,130
Say her name.

2679
02:40:02,330 --> 02:40:02,550
Boo.

2680
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:10,760
Um, what have we missed besides this?

2681
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:18,600
I think we have gotten everything.

2682
02:40:18,780 --> 02:40:19,400
Oh, wait, this one.

2683
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:21,460
I always miss this slide, I swear.

2684
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:23,540
I'm gonna paint it pink.

2685
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:26,520
We're gonna paint it a different color.

2686
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:34,180
We're gonna paint it brick.

2687
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:40,740
Oh, that's not exactly how I thought it would be at all.

2688
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:43,880
We painted it brown.

2689
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:47,000
You like granola crunch?

2690
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:48,480
Now try the crack!

2691
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:49,800
Yeah!

2692
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:55,480
Did I get this one?

2693
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:56,280
Yes.

2694
02:40:56,580 --> 02:40:56,720
Okay.

2695
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:58,760
Alright, let's sleep.

2696
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:05,910
I'll hail the poop tube.

2697
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:09,910
How much further until we're...

2698
02:41:10,830 --> 02:41:12,290
Until we're a...

2699
02:41:12,290 --> 02:41:14,590
Two and a half star park!

2700
02:41:15,770 --> 02:41:17,490
Or three star park.

2701
02:41:17,770 --> 02:41:18,990
Oh, uh...

2702
02:41:19,610 --> 02:41:20,910
Hot dogs...

2703
02:41:21,470 --> 02:41:22,470
Are good, I think.

2704
02:41:22,930 --> 02:41:25,790
Lemonade is probably good, but we'll restock a granola.

2705
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:29,270
Lynchie slide!

2706
02:41:33,090 --> 02:42:03,580
I can't believe we buy this at Kmart a whole box for $50 and then we sell them for 20 a pop over across the street like oh did I not clean these oh my gosh Victor you're so nice I mean I'm paying you to do this Victor stop lying down on the job okay good business I know right We're pretty good at this business thing,

2707
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:04,050
I'd say.

2708
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:05,240
Kaisal!

2709
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:11,020
What does he do?

2710
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:19,520
Oh my gosh!

2711
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:21,370
Wait, he actually ate all my hot dogs!

2712
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:27,640
Ay, ay!

2713
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:29,140
Maybe this is... Ay, ay!

2714
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:37,780
But he knew what he wanted.

2715
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:41,160
It's so mead.

2716
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:46,060
Another cheater this early in the day?

2717
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:50,260
There he goes.

2718
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:54,880
Uh, there he goes.

2719
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:58,080
I'm so mean to K-so, I know!

2720
02:42:58,680 --> 02:42:59,520
It feels...

2721
02:43:00,040 --> 02:43:02,800
It feels a little wrong.

2722
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:09,000
Are you supposed to be here?

2723
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:09,760
Yes.

2724
02:43:13,380 --> 02:43:15,060
What if you buy the poster?

2725
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:16,360
Wait, the poster?

2726
02:43:19,460 --> 02:43:21,020
There's a poster you can buy?

2727
02:43:21,240 --> 02:43:22,300
Welcome to K-MAR.

2728
02:43:24,970 --> 02:43:26,110
I don't see a poster.

2729
02:43:26,630 --> 02:43:29,790
I want that shark though.

2730
02:43:30,330 --> 02:43:31,930
Look at the Mr. Old.

2731
02:43:32,110 --> 02:43:32,910
Oh, poster.

2732
02:43:34,630 --> 02:43:35,870
Not unlocked.

2733
02:43:36,410 --> 02:43:37,510
I don't have it yet.

2734
02:43:44,190 --> 02:43:45,970
My internet's gonna die because of maintenance works.

2735
02:43:46,270 --> 02:43:47,190
No, Phil!

2736
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:50,470
Come back to us, Phil!

2737
02:43:51,250 --> 02:43:53,520
Phil, no!

2738
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:54,760
Phil, no!

2739
02:43:58,050 --> 02:43:59,470
Thank you for the super tight.

2740
02:44:10,740 --> 02:44:11,360
Okay.

2741
02:44:12,860 --> 02:44:14,580
Oh, repair buildings!

2742
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:16,900
This is what I need to do.

2743
02:44:18,220 --> 02:44:18,780
This is easy.

2744
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:21,140
We can repair so fast.

2745
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:22,400
Just 20 of them.

2746
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:24,600
Sorry.

2747
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:25,460
Sorry.

2748
02:44:25,900 --> 02:44:26,160
Sorry.

2749
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:30,160
I gotta get to...

2750
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,660
I gotta get to 20, lady.

2751
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:32,600
You don't understand.

2752
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,480
You don't understand!

2753
02:44:43,710 --> 02:44:44,310
Nice.

2754
02:44:48,210 --> 02:44:49,670
Everything needs to be repaired.

2755
02:44:51,450 --> 02:44:52,070
I think we'll make it.

2756
02:44:52,190 --> 02:44:52,910
I think we'll make it.

2757
02:44:55,170 --> 02:44:57,830
Hey, I like trains?

2758
02:44:58,830 --> 02:44:59,870
Wait, this is not graffiti.

2759
02:45:00,010 --> 02:45:00,690
This is awesome.

2760
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:06,140
Oh, I see him.

2761
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:08,600
There's more graffiti this time, it looks like.

2762
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:10,860
Okay, one more.

2763
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:16,800
We're at two and a half stars.

2764
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:17,580
Okay.

2765
02:45:18,840 --> 02:45:20,500
Wait, get your third star.

2766
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,000
Unlock park size level 2.

2767
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:22,740
Research build.

2768
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Zero out of 10 loungers.

2769
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:25,800
Zero out of 2 pools.

2770
02:45:26,220 --> 02:45:27,280
Turn away perverts.

2771
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,540
Mop up puddles.

2772
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:30,560
Get more decoration points.

2773
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,720
Oh my gosh.

2774
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:32,680
Okay.

2775
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:41,060
Someone is drowning.

2776
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:45,760
Callum is drowning.

2777
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:46,160
No, wait.

2778
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:47,040
Two people are drowning.

2779
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:48,500
Oh, this year you're also drowning.

2780
02:45:54,090 --> 02:45:54,870
Any perverts?

2781
02:45:54,990 --> 02:45:55,410
around?

2782
02:45:56,310 --> 02:45:57,530
Perverts are welcome in my park.

2783
02:45:57,770 --> 02:45:58,590
Oh, wait.

2784
02:46:03,090 --> 02:46:04,110
Perverts are welcome here.

2785
02:46:05,730 --> 02:46:07,090
Perverts are welcome for now.

2786
02:46:08,170 --> 02:46:08,730
Perverts are welcome.

2787
02:46:10,990 --> 02:46:12,430
I'm on my way.

2788
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:13,770
Everybody here in chat.

2789
02:46:15,970 --> 02:46:17,470
Come to the park.

2790
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:24,580
I'm both.

2791
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,320
I literally fed her.

2792
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:31,640
She did not wait too long.

2793
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:32,240
at all.

2794
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:32,960
Shut up.

2795
02:46:35,660 --> 02:46:37,860
Phoebe, stop going to the park if you don't know how to swim.

2796
02:46:41,220 --> 02:46:42,500
What would you like, plan?

2797
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:44,420
Alright, now I gotta go save.

2798
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:47,280
Matthew was injured.

2799
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:48,660
How?

2800
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:50,780
Why did I receive a fine?

2801
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:52,500
Matthew, are you okay?

2802
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:53,980
Matthew?

2803
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:55,360
Matthew?

2804
02:46:58,240 --> 02:46:59,500
Oh, we're three people.

2805
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:00,160
We're three.

2806
02:47:03,280 --> 02:47:05,980
I think somebody died.

2807
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:07,000
Uh-oh.

2808
02:47:07,780 --> 02:47:08,960
Everybody's drowning.

2809
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:16,180
How am I supposed to fulfill these?

2810
02:47:17,400 --> 02:47:18,140
Parameters.

2811
02:47:19,300 --> 02:47:20,640
But everything is happening.

2812
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:22,700
I gotta do more loungers.

2813
02:47:23,220 --> 02:47:23,900
Ten more?

2814
02:47:23,980 --> 02:47:24,840
That's crazy.

2815
02:47:28,100 --> 02:47:29,840
Low jumper is dirty.

2816
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:31,000
What's low jumper?

2817
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:34,760
He's dead.

2818
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:36,960
Is this?

2819
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:38,320
No, this is not the low jumper.

2820
02:47:39,720 --> 02:47:40,060
Kiara's waiting.

2821
02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:41,600
I won't let you wait my queen.

2822
02:47:43,320 --> 02:47:44,460
Add lemon and ice.

2823
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:46,240
Anything for you?

2824
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:51,440
I gotta find for the ambulance.

2825
02:47:52,440 --> 02:47:53,260
Triple decker?

2826
02:47:58,390 --> 02:47:59,350
Any perverts?

2827
02:47:59,990 --> 02:48:00,390
Victor?

2828
02:48:02,110 --> 02:48:02,690
What about you?

2829
02:48:02,730 --> 02:48:04,410
Do you have any naughty thoughts right now?

2830
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:18,710
Okay.

2831
02:48:18,730 --> 02:48:19,290
Okay.

2832
02:48:20,190 --> 02:48:20,730
Mopping up puddles.

2833
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,670
Mopping up puddles.

2834
02:48:23,630 --> 02:48:24,390
All right.

2835
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:25,710
All right.

2836
02:48:26,390 --> 02:48:26,850
Here we go.

2837
02:48:27,030 --> 02:48:28,010
Oh, look, it even shows.

2838
02:48:28,310 --> 02:48:29,350
Alfred's waiting for Lemonade.

2839
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:33,930
Add ice.

2840
02:48:35,050 --> 02:48:38,110
Am I the only person who doesn't frick with water parks at all?

2841
02:48:38,670 --> 02:48:38,990
No.

2842
02:48:39,270 --> 02:48:40,610
Theocross, you were so valid.

2843
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:43,110
I think I talked about this last time, actually.

2844
02:48:43,290 --> 02:48:44,090
How, like, theme park?

2845
02:48:44,250 --> 02:48:45,010
Or not theme parks, sorry.

2846
02:48:45,270 --> 02:48:47,490
Water parks are really gross?

2847
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:53,730
And I haven't been to one in a really long time because of that.

2848
02:48:56,350 --> 02:48:57,090
Pervert bottom right?

2849
02:48:59,410 --> 02:49:01,690
We prefer to be called little freaks.

2850
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:04,170
Where are my perverts at?

2851
02:49:05,150 --> 02:49:06,590
I should have... Oh, Victor.

2852
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:07,690
There he is.

2853
02:49:07,950 --> 02:49:09,330
There's one of them.

2854
02:49:10,630 --> 02:49:12,250
Victor's a real pervert here.

2855
02:49:15,610 --> 02:49:17,170
We love him for it.

2856
02:49:18,830 --> 02:49:21,650
I should have named this like freak island or something.

2857
02:49:22,010 --> 02:49:22,310
Ad lemon.

2858
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:30,400
I like the one connected to Cedar Point.

2859
02:49:32,320 --> 02:49:33,640
Last time I went to one.

2860
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:37,800
Well, not last time, but the one that's like closest to me, I suppose.

2861
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:40,880
Which is not very close, but...

2862
02:49:42,860 --> 02:49:43,360
Um...

2863
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:46,200
Uh, I went with my friend.

2864
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:50,860
And she got like the worst stomach bug ever.

2865
02:49:52,360 --> 02:49:52,800
You know?

2866
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:54,360
Oh, come on.

2867
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:55,840
Kiara, I'm so sorry.

2868
02:49:57,520 --> 02:49:58,520
Don't slip.

2869
02:50:03,570 --> 02:50:03,930
Oh.

2870
02:50:04,630 --> 02:50:05,990
I must leave you, my queen.

2871
02:50:09,630 --> 02:50:12,650
Slide past adult four hours.

2872
02:50:14,330 --> 02:50:14,670
Yeah.

2873
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:16,190
Yeah.

2874
02:50:18,110 --> 02:50:19,090
Does she need sunscreen?

2875
02:50:19,330 --> 02:50:20,670
She's gonna turn...

2876
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:22,790
She's gonna tan like crazy, like everybody else.

2877
02:50:25,170 --> 02:50:26,650
Everybody who starts come in here.

2878
02:50:27,650 --> 02:50:29,550
Tan's crazy.

2879
02:50:30,970 --> 02:50:32,110
Six hour team.

2880
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:38,910
Braylon, you can't just turn your back on the customers like this.

2881
02:50:41,950 --> 02:50:42,810
Here, I'll get you.

2882
02:50:43,010 --> 02:50:43,230
You're hot.

2883
02:50:45,890 --> 02:50:46,270
Dog.

2884
02:50:50,570 --> 02:50:52,330
I won't keep you waiting.

2885
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:03,640
He's still going.

2886
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:04,980
Oh, he's fine now.

2887
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:08,340
Let's go.

2888
02:51:08,500 --> 02:51:09,880
My people need me.

2889
02:51:12,160 --> 02:51:12,740
Add both.

2890
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:15,840
Oh, we've only gotten the puddles.

2891
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:17,360
But like...

2892
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:18,800
And I'll have to do the pools.

2893
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:20,640
We'll do that after, obviously.

2894
02:51:21,380 --> 02:51:21,940
But...

2895
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:24,220
There's so many little floaties around here.

2896
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:30,210
Good job, Braylon.

2897
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:31,730
Do your job.

2898
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:36,380
Add lemon.

2899
02:51:37,380 --> 02:51:37,940
Oh, dang it!

2900
02:51:38,020 --> 02:51:39,040
Oh, dang it!

2901
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:42,320
I messed up!

2902
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:43,400
Frosty, welcome back!

2903
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:43,900
Thank you!

2904
02:51:46,200 --> 02:51:47,480
2.5 stars.

2905
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:49,040
That's like huge in this city.

2906
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:52,440
Uh, Xander?

2907
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:53,840
We're about to kick your ass.

2908
02:51:56,800 --> 02:52:05,280
Um, it's like, so basically, uh, in Japan, people are extremely, like, extremely...

2909
02:52:05,300 --> 02:52:25,500
about how they rate places they kind of are just like nothing deserves five stars because nothing is perfect kind of mentality so you'll find that there will be a lot of pretty low rated places for that reason like

2910
02:52:28,790 --> 02:52:43,950
3.5 is like not bad it's actually like pretty good and the comments you know similar where it's like i really love the food here the atmosphere is great 3.5

2911
02:52:47,910 --> 02:52:51,730

2913
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:20,240
Don't worry, go thank you for the five gifts.

2914
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:21,240
Thank you.

2915
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:26,580
Mr. Yum-yum, I give it the five gifts.

2916
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:28,920

Thanks for the gifts.

2918
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:33,260
This perv on my screen is the best five stars.

2919
02:53:38,510 --> 02:53:39,790
Please wait, Beatrice.

2920
02:53:57,830 --> 02:53:58,730
Oh, my bad.

2921
02:54:00,290 --> 02:54:02,010
Oh, wait, I thought you were not here.

2922
02:54:03,050 --> 02:54:03,450
Okay.

2923
02:54:07,770 --> 02:54:08,890
157 in tips!

2924
02:54:12,470 --> 02:54:12,850
Okay.

2925
02:54:13,710 --> 02:54:14,010
Alright.

2926
02:54:15,310 --> 02:54:16,690
We're almost done with the puddles.

2927
02:54:17,170 --> 02:54:19,850
My goal of turn for today is to get to the three stars.

2928
02:54:20,010 --> 02:54:20,990
I think we can do that.

2929
02:54:23,830 --> 02:54:25,190
I think we can at least do that.

2930
02:54:28,370 --> 02:54:29,570
And we will...

2931
02:54:31,910 --> 02:54:33,870
We gotta turn away perverts.

2932
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:35,230
That's kind of RNG, though.

2933
02:54:37,470 --> 02:54:38,410
I feel.

2934
02:54:45,700 --> 02:54:46,560
We'll see.

2935
02:54:47,980 --> 02:54:49,560
We need more serenities.

2936
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:52,420
Yeah, we need to keep inviting her...

2937
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:53,040
In.

2938
02:54:55,040 --> 02:54:57,320
You're just gonna stare at that puddle, Victor.

2939
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:01,240
Need a lot of stuff, Bill.

2940
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:01,700
Yeah.

2941
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:05,520
You need a lot of stuff to...

2942
02:55:05,520 --> 02:55:07,440
Did I get this guy?

2943
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:07,740
Yeah.

2944
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:08,200
Okay.

2945
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:12,060
You're standing on this, but do I need to get it?

2946
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:12,300
No.

2947
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:12,640
Okay.

2948
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:14,380
Okay.

2949
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:19,440
Let's repair everything first and do all that we need to do.

2950
02:55:20,860 --> 02:55:25,080
Let's get everything in tip... Well, actually, I think I'm gonna be demolishing some of these pools, no?

2951
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:28,900
He's off the clock.

2952
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:30,680
Like, do I need to clean these?

2953
02:55:30,740 --> 02:55:31,800
I'm gonna be demolishing... Wait.

2954
02:55:32,020 --> 02:55:33,000
What's my...

2955
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:33,220
Okay.

2956
02:55:35,500 --> 02:55:37,700
Two pools with at least two prestige.

2957
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:44,460
None of my pools have prestige.

2958
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:46,300
Okay.

2959
02:55:47,240 --> 02:55:47,660
Alright.

2960
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:49,320
So yeah.

2961
02:55:49,620 --> 02:55:50,540
There's no point in.

2962
02:55:52,820 --> 02:55:53,560
No point.

2963
02:55:57,080 --> 02:55:58,140
Spend points, girl.

2964
02:55:58,260 --> 02:55:58,980
I will.

2965
02:56:07,420 --> 02:56:08,140
I will.

2966
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:10,480
I will.

2967
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:16,500
Alright, but now, people are gonna come in tomorrow and be like, Oh my god.

2968
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:19,580
This is the greatest place.

2969
02:56:19,640 --> 02:56:19,960
Bye-bye.

2970
02:56:26,900 --> 02:56:27,300
Okay.

2971
02:56:28,420 --> 02:56:30,360
Make sure we get my ball, my beach ball.

2972
02:56:32,020 --> 02:56:33,020
Isn't there another beach ball?

2973
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:34,680
Am I crazy?

2974
02:56:34,780 --> 02:56:35,820
I don't know where it is, actually.

2975
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:37,700
Sledge!

2976
02:56:37,980 --> 02:56:38,180
Sledge!

2977
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:39,300
Sledge, have a!

2978
02:56:43,360 --> 02:56:44,440
Get rid of it all.

2979
02:56:46,700 --> 02:56:48,820
What is that, Loungeer, the timeout zone?

2980
02:56:48,920 --> 02:56:50,200
No, it's the sexy zone.

2981
02:56:50,300 --> 02:56:52,780
in case you need a little bit of a private time.

2982
02:56:57,430 --> 02:56:57,650
See?

2983
02:56:58,690 --> 02:57:00,150
Nobody can see you there.

2984
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:03,150
That's where all the perverts will go!

2985
02:57:04,870 --> 02:57:06,550
That's the goal, at least!

2986
02:57:08,910 --> 02:57:09,490
The goal!

2987
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:10,190
The goal!

2988
02:57:11,850 --> 02:57:15,510
Good thing I have enough money to get several pools, though, no?

2989
02:57:16,910 --> 02:57:20,230
Wait, if graffiti changed anything, it would be illegal.

2990
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:43,240
huh wait i don't get it do i make my own graffiti cashier okay before we unlock things that require money well i can unlock things that don't require money little highlight modern toilets we'll aim for the toilet two people toilet

2991
02:57:53,450 --> 02:57:58,770
their hands will deliver justice with a satisfying oomph all right well we have more patient

2992
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:03,690
The corner pool.

2993
02:58:04,730 --> 02:58:07,030
Whoa, this thing is humongous.

2994
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:12,750
Okay, actually this fits really well.

2995
02:58:14,410 --> 02:58:14,730
No ice.

2996
02:58:16,610 --> 02:58:20,110
You thought this was a water park, but it was actually a holding pen for local perverts.

2997
02:58:20,310 --> 02:58:21,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2998
02:58:23,830 --> 02:58:24,230
Exactly.

2999
02:58:24,710 --> 02:58:26,010
Oh, wait, that pool was only 600.

3000
02:58:29,630 --> 02:58:30,030
Pizza.

3001
02:58:30,170 --> 02:58:32,670
Pizza pool, pizza pool.

3002
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:34,630
Pizza, pizza, pizza pool.

3003
02:58:35,490 --> 02:58:36,430
It's a pizza pool.

3004
02:58:36,950 --> 02:58:37,950
It's a pizza pool.

3005
02:58:38,690 --> 02:58:40,630
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza pool.

3006
02:58:41,590 --> 02:58:42,910
It's the pizza pool.

3007
02:58:44,290 --> 02:58:47,390
And then we got whatever the hell this is.

3008
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:48,370
Oh my gosh, they're huge.

3009
02:58:49,510 --> 02:58:50,770
Wait, we're so close.

3010
02:58:51,250 --> 02:58:51,790
We can do this.

3011
02:58:51,970 --> 02:58:52,510
We can fit it.

3012
02:58:53,070 --> 02:58:53,330
Ah!

3013
02:58:54,390 --> 02:58:55,790
Oh, not quite.

3014
02:58:56,090 --> 02:58:57,170
Well, we have to move some stuff.

3015
02:59:06,230 --> 02:59:07,250
Move you.

3016
02:59:09,110 --> 02:59:09,810
Move you.

3017
02:59:10,490 --> 02:59:10,930
Okay.

3018
02:59:13,900 --> 02:59:14,400
There we go.

3019
02:59:15,960 --> 02:59:16,640
There we go.

3020
02:59:18,100 --> 02:59:18,540
And you know what?

3021
02:59:18,860 --> 02:59:20,280
Well, this pool...

3022
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:20,460
No.

3023
02:59:22,340 --> 02:59:24,380
This pool can have two...

3024
02:59:24,380 --> 02:59:25,660
Two of them.

3025
02:59:27,580 --> 02:59:28,780
Two slides.

3026
02:59:29,060 --> 02:59:33,240
And people will definitely not hit each other in the face, I think.

3027
02:59:33,660 --> 02:59:36,400
They definitely won't go at the same time.

3028
02:59:37,380 --> 02:59:39,500
and knock each other out.

3029
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:41,740
Two of them, two of them, two of them, two of them.

3030
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:43,700
Two of them.

3031
02:59:44,140 --> 02:59:44,900
Two of them.

3032
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:46,340
Two of them.

3033
02:59:56,200 --> 02:59:56,680
Okay.

3034
02:59:57,760 --> 02:59:58,540
Looking good.

3035
02:59:58,980 --> 02:59:59,940
Looking sexy.

3036
03:00:06,190 --> 03:00:06,490
Wow.

3037
03:00:06,750 --> 03:00:08,290
These pools are giant.

3038
03:00:09,210 --> 03:00:09,830
Okay, hold on.

3039
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:14,680
Maybe we'll like...

3040
03:00:14,680 --> 03:00:16,420
Yeah, we'll do like this a little bit more.

3041
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:27,870
Like that.

3042
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:29,970
Like that.

3043
03:00:31,730 --> 03:00:32,430
Like that.

3044
03:00:34,030 --> 03:00:34,330
Okay.

3045
03:00:35,650 --> 03:00:36,050
Okay.

3046
03:00:37,690 --> 03:00:38,910
The peanut pool.

3047
03:00:39,890 --> 03:00:40,550
My eyes!

3048
03:00:40,650 --> 03:00:41,470
It's so bright.

3049
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:47,230
Prestige level 2.

3050
03:00:47,830 --> 03:00:48,570
Achieved!

3051
03:00:54,350 --> 03:00:56,410
Wow, they're really...

3052
03:00:56,410 --> 03:00:58,010
Like, the color is so vibrant.

3053
03:00:59,810 --> 03:01:01,610
Oh, I only needed to build two pools.

3054
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:02,050
Oops.

3055
03:01:02,930 --> 03:01:03,370
That's fine.

3056
03:01:04,150 --> 03:01:06,030
All right, let's spend some more points.

3057
03:01:06,230 --> 03:01:07,510
I need also decoration.

3058
03:01:08,850 --> 03:01:09,590
Lots of decoration.

3059
03:01:12,510 --> 03:01:13,390
Um, only...

3060
03:01:13,390 --> 03:01:14,770
I've got to turn away the perverts.

3061
03:01:15,650 --> 03:01:17,110
Loungeers, loungers, loungers.

3062
03:01:17,330 --> 03:01:17,930
I was like, wait a second.

3063
03:01:18,050 --> 03:01:19,510
I need more money for something.

3064
03:01:20,090 --> 03:01:21,270
For more loungers!

3065
03:01:22,050 --> 03:01:24,330
We'll build them all over here.

3066
03:01:25,410 --> 03:01:26,850
We have so much space here.

3067
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:29,430
Loungeer.

3068
03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:35,180
With prestige level 2.

3069
03:01:36,520 --> 03:01:37,580
Okay, never mind.

3070
03:01:46,700 --> 03:01:47,500
Modern challengers!

3071
03:01:54,870 --> 03:01:55,130
Okay.

3072
03:01:55,790 --> 03:01:56,970
Then I should get rid of these.

3073
03:02:00,540 --> 03:02:02,420
See if you can get the park size upgraded.

3074
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:05,280
I think we only get that once we get the three stars.

3075
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:11,740
Park size level two, yeah.

3076
03:02:13,620 --> 03:02:14,060
Oh, wait.

3077
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:14,560
Oh, wait.

3078
03:02:14,660 --> 03:02:15,260
That's a research.

3079
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:15,480
Never mind.

3080
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:21,820

3087
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:51,070
wait I want to get up here do I eventually unlock this area too?

3088
03:03:52,230 --> 03:03:53,350
What are they building here?

3089
03:03:57,860 --> 03:03:58,300
Fascinating.

3090
03:03:59,940 --> 03:04:01,260
I want to Fulton those.

3091
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:05,040
Every time I see containers, I want to Fulton them.

3092
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:06,880
Does anyone else have that?

3093
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:11,980
Have that, you know, after playing MGSV?

3094
03:04:13,720 --> 03:04:16,000
You see a container, you're like, I want to Fulton that.

3095
03:04:22,590 --> 03:04:23,470
Yes, in real life.

3096
03:04:23,530 --> 03:04:23,910
Me too!

3097
03:04:24,310 --> 03:04:26,630
I see something and I'm like, oh, I want to fault in that.

3098
03:04:27,350 --> 03:04:28,430
I want to take that home.

3099
03:04:29,830 --> 03:04:31,670
I think Victor is bugged.

3100
03:04:37,240 --> 03:04:38,240
Oh, he's fine now.

3101
03:04:38,320 --> 03:04:39,100
He's fine now.

3102
03:04:41,600 --> 03:04:42,420
I think.

3103
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:46,140
He's like a Sims who...

3104
03:04:46,140 --> 03:04:51,900
He's like a Sim who had the ladder removed from the pool.

3105
03:04:55,460 --> 03:04:56,660
Okay, loungers.

3106
03:04:59,240 --> 03:05:00,840
Ooh, classic loungers.

3107
03:05:01,020 --> 03:05:02,500
We need 10 of these.

3108
03:05:03,480 --> 03:05:04,520
I thought it was 20 for a second.

3109
03:05:04,640 --> 03:05:05,780
I was about to be like, there's no way.

3110
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:07,580
This cost?

3111
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:10,040
200 a pop?

3112
03:05:10,200 --> 03:05:10,800
There's no way.

3113
03:05:26,710 --> 03:05:27,930
How many do I have?

3114
03:05:29,890 --> 03:05:35,910
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

3115
03:05:46,290 --> 03:05:48,970
Oh my, this increases my guest capacity too.

3116
03:05:49,730 --> 03:05:50,490
That's huge.

3117
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:59,420
Oh, I forgot about this one.

3118
03:06:08,420 --> 03:06:10,580
I hope we get some perverts tomorrow.

3119
03:06:13,600 --> 03:06:14,740
Will you hire more workers?

3120
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:16,100
I have to unlock that.

3121
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:18,520
I currently have a capacity.

3122
03:06:19,700 --> 03:06:21,520
Actually, I don't know what my capacity is.

3123
03:06:21,560 --> 03:06:22,080
Two out of two.

3124
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:23,840
I don't know how to get more.

3125
03:06:27,620 --> 03:06:28,420
More granola?

3126
03:06:28,560 --> 03:06:29,500
We should have more granola.

3127
03:06:29,640 --> 03:06:30,140
Let's see.

3128
03:06:30,240 --> 03:06:30,520
I wonder.

3129
03:06:32,500 --> 03:06:32,900
Oh.

3130
03:06:33,340 --> 03:06:38,000
Oh, maintenance under maintenance, maybe.

3131
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:42,200
Mop upgrade.

3132
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:43,000
Increases your mop.

3133
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:44,300
Wait, that's big.

3134
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:44,960
That's big.

3135
03:06:47,400 --> 03:06:48,340
That's pretty big.

3136
03:06:49,320 --> 03:06:49,320
Okay.

3137
03:06:52,830 --> 03:06:54,510
You get another after three stars.

3138
03:06:55,590 --> 03:06:56,930
Yeah, hiring level three.

3139
03:06:57,590 --> 03:06:58,690
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3140
03:06:59,410 --> 03:07:00,190
Yes, yes, yes.

3141
03:07:03,590 --> 03:07:24,230
This is looking like a real park if i do say so myself oh my gosh there's gonna be so much to repair so much to clean is this been always crooked is this always been crooked all bad oops

3142
03:07:30,980 --> 03:07:32,940
didn't you unlock toilet level two

3143
03:07:48,640 --> 03:07:50,460
The hot dog stand is also crooked?

3144
03:07:52,520 --> 03:07:52,760
Oh.

3145
03:07:58,400 --> 03:07:58,880
Is that butter?

3146
03:07:59,900 --> 03:08:00,600
No, I think it's crooked.

3147
03:08:00,720 --> 03:08:03,060
I think I crookeded it the other way.

3148
03:08:06,460 --> 03:08:07,340
There we go.

3149
03:08:08,140 --> 03:08:08,900
There we go.

3150
03:08:11,720 --> 03:08:12,440
No worries.

3151
03:08:14,860 --> 03:08:17,200
So this can fit one person or two?

3152
03:08:27,260 --> 03:08:28,240
I guess one.

3153
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:31,780
But they sure are fancy.

3154
03:08:33,620 --> 03:08:34,200
Bronze on.

3155
03:08:34,320 --> 03:08:36,180
Thank you so much for the 50 gift.

3156
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:37,000
Thank you.

3157
03:08:37,900 --> 03:08:38,720
Holy moly.

3158
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:39,680
Thank you so much.

3159
03:08:39,980 --> 03:08:40,100
Thank you.

3160
03:08:40,340 --> 03:08:40,660
Thank you.

3161
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:45,440
Wow.

3162
03:08:46,420 --> 03:08:46,840
Oh.

3163
03:08:47,820 --> 03:08:49,640
They can wash their hands now.

3164
03:08:50,340 --> 03:08:51,780
Let's build another set over.

3165
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:52,900
Okay, Victor.

3166
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:53,860
Get out of there.

3167
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:55,740
Let's build another set over here.

3168
03:08:56,020 --> 03:08:57,000
Why did it do that?

3169
03:08:57,260 --> 03:08:57,600
Eh.

3170
03:09:02,290 --> 03:09:03,290
Like this.

3171
03:09:05,430 --> 03:09:07,610
Oh, they just need one.

3172
03:09:13,290 --> 03:09:14,690
Did you do two?

3173
03:09:15,350 --> 03:09:17,410
Oh, thank you for...

3174
03:09:17,410 --> 03:09:17,910
100!

3175
03:09:18,110 --> 03:09:18,590
Thank you!

3176
03:09:22,830 --> 03:09:23,830
Double 50!

3177
03:09:24,550 --> 03:09:25,770
I appreciate it so much.

3178
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:28,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3179
03:09:32,600 --> 03:09:33,680
We'll keep this.

3180
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:36,520
This will let the people know what they will have in the future.

3181
03:09:37,320 --> 03:09:49,120
keep spending money baby though i do need some more decoration as well so let's uh let's put some fountains we'll put one in the big pool

3182
03:09:52,640 --> 03:10:04,980
and we'll do oh we have some better umbrellas some bigger umbrellas bigger bigger umbrellas we have some umbrellas

3183
03:10:13,350 --> 03:10:23,550
You know, I'm actually, whenever I play like a simulation game like this, like even the Sims and stuff, decorating is my least favorite part.

3184
03:10:24,510 --> 03:10:27,110
I think it's because I'm not very good at it.

3185
03:10:29,790 --> 03:10:34,810
I'm just not, I don't really have that kind of sense, you know?

3186
03:10:35,590 --> 03:10:38,610
But we can add some more flowers too.

3187
03:10:38,610 --> 03:10:49,750
the flower beds are kind of nice we'll do like a planner around here or something I don't know we'll do a couple it'll look nice I think

3188
03:11:01,830 --> 03:11:19,430
just have fun with it yeah I try I try you know um this is looking cute though I'd like to say it looks pretty cute I think I think Excel?

3189
03:11:20,230 --> 03:11:21,450
I think it looks nice.

3190
03:11:22,350 --> 03:11:23,210
A little bit.

3191
03:11:23,950 --> 03:11:26,030
Let's also, let's get rid of these.

3192
03:11:29,310 --> 03:11:30,210
We're starting to lose.

3193
03:11:31,370 --> 03:11:32,610
We're starting to

3194
03:11:37,370 --> 03:11:37,870
um...

3195
03:11:37,870 --> 03:11:39,410
Because we got better umbrellas.

3196
03:11:43,130 --> 03:11:43,710
Oh my gosh!

3197
03:11:44,030 --> 03:11:44,390
Another?

3198
03:11:45,550 --> 03:11:46,070
Thank you!

3199
03:11:46,250 --> 03:11:46,590
Thank you!

3200
03:11:46,610 --> 03:11:46,910
Thank you!

3201
03:11:49,950 --> 03:11:51,150
Bronson, thank you so much.

3202
03:11:52,510 --> 03:11:53,390
How are we?

3203
03:11:53,810 --> 03:11:54,410
Thank you!

3204
03:12:00,260 --> 03:12:07,860
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, thank you so much.

3205
03:12:08,380 --> 03:12:10,300
Okay, I think that's all the...

3206
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:12,420
Okay, so now we can include this.

3207
03:12:14,940 --> 03:12:17,940
And these are $80 each.

3208
03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:18,340
Woo!

3209
03:12:19,020 --> 03:12:19,500
Okay.

3210
03:12:20,120 --> 03:12:21,240
That's fine.

3211
03:12:21,840 --> 03:12:22,880
We'll make it back.

3212
03:12:23,440 --> 03:12:23,860
Eventually.

3213
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:25,400
Probably.

3214
03:12:26,660 --> 03:12:26,840
Probably.

3215
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,960
We just gotta add a couple to get our, what's it called, up.

3216
03:12:36,560 --> 03:12:37,880
Our decoration up.

3217
03:12:42,860 --> 03:12:44,340
I'll add some over here too.

3218
03:12:46,460 --> 03:12:47,140
It looks legit.

3219
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:48,720
It looks like a real park.

3220
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:53,000
This is looking fantastic.

3221
03:12:54,120 --> 03:12:55,160
It's looking fancy.

3222
03:12:56,140 --> 03:12:56,340
Okay.

3223
03:12:57,300 --> 03:12:57,980
Now you build.

3224
03:12:58,300 --> 03:12:59,080
And then we sleep.

3225
03:13:02,780 --> 03:13:05,020
The granola will pay for it.

3226
03:13:05,640 --> 03:13:07,360
We're making more money, I don't know.

3227
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:09,700
In the water park.

3228
03:13:09,860 --> 03:13:10,060
No!

3229
03:13:13,980 --> 03:13:16,440
Oh, my water park is...

3230
03:13:16,440 --> 03:13:18,160
We're swimming in cash.

3231
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:20,420
Get it swimming because we're a water park.

3232
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:22,360
We're swimming in it.

3233
03:13:24,180 --> 03:13:28,020
Okay, I think these don't add as much as I thought that they would, but that's okay.

3234
03:13:31,220 --> 03:13:33,220
We just need 200 more, I think.

3235
03:13:34,240 --> 03:13:34,720
Yeah.

3236
03:13:36,900 --> 03:13:38,460
We can work on it.

3237
03:13:41,180 --> 03:13:46,960
We still gotta turn away five perverts, so we won't get it immediately anyway.

3238
03:13:47,340 --> 03:13:47,780
Alright, sleep.

3239
03:13:50,640 --> 03:13:52,300
I D-D-D-I.

3240
03:13:52,680 --> 03:13:55,080
I don't get it.

3241
03:13:56,500 --> 03:13:57,060
Why not?

3242
03:13:59,480 --> 03:14:01,000
Did I repair everything?

3243
03:14:02,180 --> 03:14:03,860
You know, actually, I don't know if I did.

3244
03:14:19,530 --> 03:14:21,430
I'll be one of the five.

3245
03:14:21,550 --> 03:14:23,750
I need you guys to pull your weight, okay?

3246
03:14:24,490 --> 03:14:25,330
Perverts, assemble!

3247
03:14:26,290 --> 03:14:27,350
Everyone, pull your weight.

3248
03:14:28,710 --> 03:14:31,970
We need to get to three stars, okay?

3249
03:14:35,590 --> 03:14:38,070
We need to get the three stars stat.

3250
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:45,900
With all our powers combined.

3251
03:14:48,580 --> 03:14:49,420
Perverts assemble!

3252
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:52,360
Okay, I think I did repair everything.

3253
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:54,040
Well, I think about it.

3254
03:14:59,810 --> 03:15:01,870
Oh, I can't place an attraction there.

3255
03:15:02,950 --> 03:15:03,550
I can...

3256
03:15:03,550 --> 03:15:05,370
I'm trying to get it closer to the vending machine.

3257
03:15:06,050 --> 03:15:06,390
You know what?

3258
03:15:06,390 --> 03:15:06,790
Screw it.

3259
03:15:06,850 --> 03:15:07,240
I don't care.

3260
03:15:12,580 --> 03:15:12,800
Ha!

3261
03:15:13,740 --> 03:15:14,120
Ha!

3262
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:16,380
Park is open!

3263
03:15:17,060 --> 03:15:17,280
Baby!

3264
03:15:22,900 --> 03:15:23,320
Milo!

3265
03:15:23,940 --> 03:15:25,380
Milo, wait, you know my park.

3266
03:15:25,740 --> 03:15:26,500
Milo, Milo, my park!

3267
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:27,320
Milo, what are you doing?

3268
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:28,580
Come on in, buddy.

3269
03:15:30,240 --> 03:15:31,200
Where are you?

3270
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:35,830
Oh, he doesn't like it.

3271
03:15:35,950 --> 03:15:36,770
He doesn't want it.

3272
03:15:37,270 --> 03:15:38,710
Where are you going, Victor?

3273
03:15:42,610 --> 03:15:43,110
What?

3274
03:15:44,030 --> 03:15:45,930
Is my park old news now?

3275
03:16:00,030 --> 03:16:03,070
Imagine if they added Snake or Oz a lot in swimsuits.

3276
03:16:05,310 --> 03:16:05,810
Speedos!

3277
03:16:08,630 --> 03:16:10,550
You're also not supposed to be in here.

3278
03:16:10,550 --> 03:16:13,770
Whoa, what's up with all these cheaters?

3279
03:16:16,450 --> 03:16:17,930
Well, let's get rid of this one.

3280
03:16:18,590 --> 03:16:20,030
And then I'll empty the trash.

3281
03:16:21,790 --> 03:16:22,110
Oh.

3282
03:16:24,250 --> 03:16:25,690
Victor, get inside.

3283
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:37,880
Doing my part.

3284
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,040
Don't do that!

3285
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:42,400
No, no, no.

3286
03:16:42,480 --> 03:16:44,200
I just need perverts who take pictures.

3287
03:16:45,400 --> 03:16:46,300
Oh my gosh, already?

3288
03:16:46,980 --> 03:16:49,200
I don't need perverts who do other things.

3289
03:16:49,600 --> 03:16:51,440
me have to clean up a bigger mess.

Me too.

3399
03:26:31,460 --> 03:26:32,680
It's so good.

03:26:33,500 --> 03:26:34,700
This game is so fun.

3401
03:26:34,840 --> 03:26:35,640
I'm not gonna lie.

3402
03:26:35,940 --> 03:26:37,020
Like, I know it's right now.

3403
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:38,640
It's like the streamer game to play.

3404
03:26:40,540 --> 03:26:42,420
But it's legitimately addicting.

3405
03:26:43,260 --> 03:26:44,440
It's so fun.

3406
03:26:55,380 --> 03:26:56,640

No, but I don't see him walking around at all.

3422
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:22,100
Oh, there he is, just kidding.

3423
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:23,660
My park is too big.

03:28:24,460 --> 03:28:26,380
I can't even, I don't even remember my...

3425
03:28:26,380 --> 03:28:28,420
We're like too big of a corporation now.

03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:32,320
I can't remember my employees' names, locations.

3427
03:28:34,820 --> 03:28:35,680

03:28:36,360 --> 03:28:36,360

Our park is, like, making it...

3434
03:28:58,240 --> 03:29:00,040
It's huge now, our park.

3435

3440
03:29:19,460 --> 03:29:21,640
I want to be in Freak City, baby.

3441
03:29:23,360 --> 03:29:24,140
New York.

3442
03:29:30,870 --> 03:29:31,770
Did I get this one?

3443
03:29:32,030 --> 03:29:32,250
Yeah.

3444
03:29:38,760 --> 03:29:43,540
Maybe they feel like this part, this like, this place is accounted for, you know?

3445
03:29:48,420 --> 03:29:51,720
They were too busy sending two for chance, the freaks?

3446
03:29:53,180 --> 03:29:54,020
Surely that's the

3447
03:29:59,790 --> 03:30:05,650
Perverts are welcome here, but also I will kick you out and take your money.

3448
03:30:06,330 --> 03:30:11,350
I will kick you out and take your money, but like lovingly, you know?

3449
03:30:12,070 --> 03:30:13,810
Oh wait, turn, turn, turn, turn.

03:30:14,490 --> 03:30:16,930
Let's take you and put you here.

3451
03:30:17,290 --> 03:30:18,190
We'll put two here.

3452
03:30:20,030 --> 03:30:21,250
Wait, how do I snap?

3453
03:30:21,510 --> 03:30:21,730
Oh, shift.

3454
03:30:22,190 --> 03:30:22,610
There we go.

3455
03:30:22,750 --> 03:30:22,990
Okay.

3456
03:30:23,930 --> 03:30:24,310

3457
03:30:24,530 --> 03:30:25,130
Okay, one more.

3458
03:30:33,900 --> 03:30:35,420
That looks a little crooked, no?

3459
03:30:35,800 --> 03:30:36,100
Yeah.

3460
03:30:37,360 --> 03:30:38,280

03:30:39,020 --> 03:30:39,340
Okay.

3462
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:43,240
Oh, I think I need to clean that one, too.

3463
03:30:44,100 --> 03:30:44,700
This one.

3464
03:30:48,840 --> 03:30:51,540
I've watched a few of these, and yours resembles a...

3465
03:30:51,540 --> 03:30:53,440
Actually resembles a water park.

3466
03:30:56,200 --> 03:30:56,740
Really?

3467
03:30:59,120 --> 03:31:00,840
You said I'm doing a good job?

3468
03:31:03,420 --> 03:31:04,500
Hot dog!

3469
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:20,380
We're putting more decorations so that we can hopefully be able to get to prestige.

3470
03:31:32,000 --> 03:31:34,400
I'm being so proper with my park.

3471
03:31:35,020 --> 03:31:36,400
How do you not make a park?

3472
03:31:36,460 --> 03:31:38,340
How do you not make it look like a water park?

3473
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:41,340
I think our place is pretty cute, though.

3474
03:31:43,060 --> 03:31:43,840
Oh my gosh.

3475
03:31:43,840 --> 03:31:45,620
It doesn't give us anything!

3476
03:31:45,940 --> 03:31:46,260
Ah!

3477
03:31:48,780 --> 03:31:52,520
If you leave the park yourself, does that count as kicking a pervert out?

3478
03:31:53,980 --> 03:31:55,180
I wish!

3479
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:06,120
Does paint help?

3480
03:32:06,240 --> 03:32:07,440
Wait, I think it does.

3481
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:08,240
I think you're right.

3482
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:10,520
I think paint does help.

3483
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:14,120
Uh...

3484
03:32:14,120 --> 03:32:14,620
Floor.

3485
03:32:15,460 --> 03:32:16,040
No space.

3486
03:32:16,380 --> 03:32:16,740
Floor.

3487
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:22,340
Uh, it was this color, right?

3488
03:32:24,820 --> 03:32:25,760
Wait.

3489
03:32:26,840 --> 03:32:27,500
Yes.

3490
03:32:28,540 --> 03:32:29,100
Does it?

3491
03:32:29,760 --> 03:32:30,600
Is it going up?

3492
03:32:32,460 --> 03:32:33,500
By one.

3493
03:32:35,220 --> 03:32:37,680
By a single point.

3494
03:32:41,790 --> 03:32:43,230
One point.

3495
03:32:43,950 --> 03:32:44,910
One point.

3496
03:32:46,630 --> 03:32:47,430
This is painful.

3497
03:32:49,970 --> 03:32:51,890
But since I have more money, I will finish it.

3498
03:33:04,560 --> 03:33:06,480
Okay, it doesn't double charge you, which is pretty nice.

3499
03:33:06,820 --> 03:33:10,180
I was thinking, I was like, wait a second, if I hold it, does it...

3500
03:33:10,180 --> 03:33:11,060
Will it charge me again?

3501
03:33:11,440 --> 03:33:11,980
But does not.

3502
03:33:13,100 --> 03:33:15,720
Okay, that area is completed.

3503
03:33:19,300 --> 03:33:21,280
Maybe I should do this area too, then.

3504
03:33:21,400 --> 03:33:22,360
Let's see, what can we do?

3505
03:33:22,700 --> 03:33:24,480
We'll do Blood Red.

3506
03:33:26,380 --> 03:33:26,600
What?

3507
03:33:27,280 --> 03:33:27,900
Wait, what?

3508
03:33:28,260 --> 03:33:28,580
What?

3509
03:33:31,220 --> 03:33:33,000
Um, am I colorblind?

3510
03:33:35,380 --> 03:33:37,720
Oh, you can change the color!

3511
03:33:38,420 --> 03:33:40,240
Oh, that's just the material type!

3512
03:33:44,060 --> 03:33:45,660
My bad.

3513
03:33:49,980 --> 03:33:50,460
Whoa!

3514
03:33:51,360 --> 03:33:52,300
Holy moly!

3515
03:33:53,280 --> 03:33:54,080
That's intense.

3516
03:33:57,940 --> 03:33:59,920
Blood, blood, blood for the blood god.

3517
03:34:13,170 --> 03:34:14,290
Three color tabs too?

3518
03:34:22,020 --> 03:34:23,440
That didn't change at all.

3519
03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:29,340
Wait, what if I do like primary, red, secondary?

3520
03:34:29,820 --> 03:34:30,840
Wait, am I doing...

3521
03:34:30,840 --> 03:34:31,480
Am I mixing?

3522
03:34:33,880 --> 03:34:34,120
No.

3523
03:34:36,280 --> 03:34:37,480
It all looks the same.

3524
03:34:38,580 --> 03:34:39,560
It all looks the same.

3525
03:34:45,530 --> 03:34:46,910
Happy water park day, Minto!

3526
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:48,450
I'm only peeking during lunch.

3527
03:34:48,850 --> 03:34:50,090
I hope the rest of the stream goes well.

3528
03:34:50,850 --> 03:34:51,650
Peep-peep-peep-oo!

3529
03:34:51,650 --> 03:34:52,290
No!

3530
03:34:52,410 --> 03:34:53,510
Don't pee me poo poo!

3531
03:34:55,350 --> 03:34:56,630
This looks horrible.

3532
03:35:01,860 --> 03:35:03,040
Oh, my eyes.

3533
03:35:03,740 --> 03:35:05,460
It looks so bad.

3534
03:35:16,380 --> 03:35:17,420
Excuse me.

3535
03:35:22,250 --> 03:35:23,750
The customers will never forget it.

3536
03:35:24,510 --> 03:35:25,290
That's for sure.

3537
03:35:26,170 --> 03:35:27,810
I'll be like, let's go to Bloodland!

3538
03:35:28,030 --> 03:35:28,310
Yeah!

3539
03:35:30,450 --> 03:35:31,710
You think it looks good?

3540
03:35:31,830 --> 03:35:32,310
No way?

3541
03:35:34,170 --> 03:35:35,330
Try black?

3542
03:35:36,090 --> 03:35:36,480
Let's see.

3543
03:35:43,520 --> 03:35:46,180
Wait, what a black stone would look like?

3544
03:35:48,360 --> 03:35:50,420
Wait, this place is kind of metal now.

3545
03:35:53,120 --> 03:35:55,100
Wait, we're actually at 400 already.

3546
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:06,680
The void calls.

3547
03:36:09,180 --> 03:36:09,540
What?

3548
03:36:10,880 --> 03:36:11,580
Oh, sorry.

3549
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:15,280
The floor is red.

3550
03:36:15,460 --> 03:36:16,320
You can hide the bloodstream.

3551
03:36:16,340 --> 03:36:17,720
It seems exactly, exactly.

3552
03:36:22,210 --> 03:36:23,650
We'll just do this for now.

3553
03:36:24,650 --> 03:36:25,190
That part.

3554
03:36:26,170 --> 03:36:27,390
I kind of want to add another pool.

3555
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:34,520
I wish I could do a big one.

3556
03:36:36,560 --> 03:36:38,460
We'll just do the corner cut again.

3557
03:36:40,620 --> 03:36:41,500
Just like here.

3558
03:36:43,280 --> 03:36:44,320
And, uh...

3559
03:36:44,320 --> 03:36:46,600
We'll do a twisty slide.

3560
03:36:48,220 --> 03:36:50,260
A fun little twisty slide.

3561
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:52,080
Yeah.

3562
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:52,380
No,

3563
03:36:57,410 --> 03:36:58,350
twisty slide.

3564
03:36:59,430 --> 03:36:59,950
Twisty slide.

3565
03:37:00,270 --> 03:37:01,190
Twisty, there we go.

3566
03:37:09,290 --> 03:37:10,490
Will this allow more people?

3567
03:37:11,850 --> 03:37:12,410
Yes!

3568
03:37:16,090 --> 03:37:16,490
Hi.

3569
03:37:16,890 --> 03:37:18,550
We're at 413 out of 500?

3570
03:37:20,270 --> 03:37:20,890
Okay.

3571
03:37:21,590 --> 03:37:22,990
Can you fix the new slide?

3572
03:37:25,390 --> 03:37:26,190
Oh, no.

3573
03:37:26,270 --> 03:37:26,690
This one?

3574
03:37:26,810 --> 03:37:27,690
No, unfortunately.

3575
03:37:29,750 --> 03:37:30,470
Only demolish.

3576
03:37:32,650 --> 03:37:33,850
Only demolish.

3577
03:37:34,450 --> 03:37:36,930
Here, we'll leave a little, we'll do a little pathway.

3578
03:37:38,150 --> 03:37:38,470
There we go.

3579
03:37:42,580 --> 03:37:43,100
Yeah.

3580
03:37:47,400 --> 03:37:49,400
And let's do a vending machine.

3581
03:37:51,260 --> 03:37:52,740
And some more trash cans.

3582
03:38:00,040 --> 03:38:00,560
Okay.

3583
03:38:02,440 --> 03:38:04,180
And, uh, decoration.

3584
03:38:05,180 --> 03:38:06,200
We could do some benches.

3585
03:38:07,240 --> 03:38:07,960
That's nice.

3586
03:38:14,100 --> 03:38:15,140
Hopefully that gives us a lot.

3587
03:38:15,160 --> 03:38:15,320
Okay.

3588
03:38:16,440 --> 03:38:17,300
I'm just out of money.

3589
03:38:21,550 --> 03:38:23,470
I can't even afford to stock my machine.

3590
03:38:30,280 --> 03:38:31,260
We're at 444!

3591
03:38:31,840 --> 03:38:32,460
So spooky.

3592
03:38:35,680 --> 03:38:36,920
Too much paint.

3593
03:38:37,320 --> 03:38:38,560
No, not enough paint.

3594
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:41,440
I'm broke, baby.

3595
03:38:42,080 --> 03:38:43,280
Alright, I think I...

3596
03:38:43,280 --> 03:38:44,840
Well, let me restock stuff.

3597
03:38:45,220 --> 03:38:45,840
Oh, wait, can I?

3598
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:48,580
Um...

3599
03:38:48,580 --> 03:38:50,840
I think I can only restock the lemonade.

3600
03:38:52,860 --> 03:38:53,380
Okay.

3601
03:38:53,400 --> 03:38:54,400
And that's it.

3602
03:38:56,880 --> 03:38:57,580
Welcome to Kmart.

3603
03:39:06,080 --> 03:39:06,640
Look everybody.

3604
03:39:08,480 --> 03:39:10,100
The park is brand new.

3605
03:39:10,860 --> 03:39:13,140
The red is so blind is so bad.

3606
03:39:14,540 --> 03:39:15,740
I missed a spot.

3607
03:39:18,620 --> 03:39:20,300
I actually hate it so much.

3608
03:39:31,380 --> 03:39:31,580
Oh.

3609
03:39:35,460 --> 03:39:36,740
Okay, we needed money.

3610
03:39:36,920 --> 03:39:38,020
I think someone did not.

3611
03:39:38,740 --> 03:39:39,460
did not pay.

3612
03:39:40,480 --> 03:39:41,700
You're gonna pay for my granola.

3613
03:39:42,540 --> 03:39:43,360
That's what you're gonna do.

3614
03:39:43,720 --> 03:39:43,720
Okay.

3615
03:39:44,240 --> 03:39:46,080
Let's go buy more granola.

3616
03:39:55,800 --> 03:39:56,620
Where'd you go?

3617
03:39:58,320 --> 03:40:00,280
And you're also gonna pay for granola.

3618
03:40:07,040 --> 03:40:07,520
Sorry.

3619
03:40:16,550 --> 03:40:16,990
Nice.

3620
03:40:18,310 --> 03:40:19,250
My eyes!

3621
03:40:19,390 --> 03:40:21,430
I might just, I just might need to change it.

3622
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:27,840
Okay.

3623
03:40:28,520 --> 03:40:28,920
Alright.

3624
03:40:29,080 --> 03:40:30,720
On the lookout for perverts, everybody.

3625
03:40:32,520 --> 03:40:41,320
On the lookout for perverts, and, um, and, uh, Victor, don't be suspicious.

3626
03:40:48,640 --> 03:40:49,380
Oh, my eyes!

3627
03:40:49,580 --> 03:40:50,780
Ah, why?

3628
03:41:01,780 --> 03:41:02,800
We got one?

3629
03:41:04,260 --> 03:41:05,920
We got one, we got one.

3630
03:41:13,530 --> 03:41:14,610
Is that a pervert sound?

3631
03:41:14,850 --> 03:41:18,530
No, I was excited about it being clean sound.

3632
03:41:20,810 --> 03:41:22,030
All right, two more perverts.

3633
03:41:27,050 --> 03:41:29,230
Oh my gosh, it hurts my eyes.

3634
03:41:29,330 --> 03:41:30,670
Okay, we're going to change it.

3635
03:41:32,250 --> 03:41:33,950
We have the money.

3636
03:41:35,730 --> 03:41:36,830
What should we change it to?

3637
03:41:40,310 --> 03:41:41,590
Let's do...

3638
03:41:41,590 --> 03:41:41,970
Mint.

3639
03:41:47,410 --> 03:41:48,310
Who was the pervert?

3640
03:41:49,230 --> 03:41:49,870
No?

3641
03:41:51,090 --> 03:41:51,410
You?

3642
03:41:51,790 --> 03:41:52,430
I

3643
03:41:55,910 --> 03:41:56,750
got...

3644
03:41:56,750 --> 03:41:57,210
Wait.

3645
03:42:02,810 --> 03:42:03,290
Oh!

3646
03:42:03,930 --> 03:42:06,030
I don't like the material, though.

3647
03:42:07,350 --> 03:42:09,470
Oh my gosh, I keep pressing the wrong thing.

3648
03:42:10,170 --> 03:42:10,570
No.

3649
03:42:10,930 --> 03:42:12,170
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3650
03:42:19,440 --> 03:42:19,760
Who?

3651
03:42:22,420 --> 03:42:22,820
You?

3652
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:39,360
Now we need the decoration.

3653
03:42:40,380 --> 03:42:40,760
Actually.

3654
03:42:42,240 --> 03:42:44,940
I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with this, though.

3655
03:42:46,240 --> 03:42:47,860
What about this color for this one?

3656
03:42:48,700 --> 03:42:50,400
Why does the mint look so bad?

3657
03:42:52,600 --> 03:42:53,000
Whoops.

3658
03:42:55,660 --> 03:42:56,100
Sad.

3659
03:43:00,420 --> 03:43:01,560
It doesn't make a difference.

3660
03:43:02,000 --> 03:43:02,900
Oh, not bad.

3661
03:43:03,720 --> 03:43:04,680
It's way too bright.

3662
03:43:04,820 --> 03:43:05,260
Let's see this one.

3663
03:43:05,360 --> 03:43:05,960
It's kind of pink.

3664
03:43:08,060 --> 03:43:08,500
It's cute.

3665
03:43:08,540 --> 03:43:08,740
What?

3666
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:11,780
Oh, the pink is cute.

3667
03:43:12,360 --> 03:43:13,060
Oh my gosh, sorry.

3668
03:43:13,160 --> 03:43:14,200
I keep pressing B instead.

3669
03:43:17,100 --> 03:43:18,720
Oh, I like this.

3670
03:43:27,100 --> 03:43:27,780
Oh, wow.

3671
03:43:27,960 --> 03:43:28,220
Yeah.

3672
03:43:28,840 --> 03:43:30,900
Do I see the red and they're like, oh, wow.

3673
03:43:32,680 --> 03:43:33,880
Oh wow!

3674
03:43:35,460 --> 03:43:35,920
Oh wow!

3675
03:43:36,840 --> 03:43:37,500
They're like, oof!

3676
03:43:38,160 --> 03:43:39,020
Don't like that.

3677
03:43:39,820 --> 03:43:42,840
The screen can only handle so much good looking mint at once.

3678
03:43:43,200 --> 03:43:43,460
That!

3679
03:43:49,940 --> 03:43:52,300
I like this like kind of muted pink.

3680
03:43:53,760 --> 03:43:55,440
It's like almost a salmon.

3681
03:43:57,480 --> 03:43:58,960
Classic lounger's dirty.

3682
03:44:00,460 --> 03:44:01,420
We'll clean it.

3683
03:44:03,660 --> 03:44:05,140
We got people waiting.

3684
03:44:05,620 --> 03:44:06,920
Hold on, this is an emergency.

3685
03:44:10,720 --> 03:44:11,660
A flesh pink!

3686
03:44:12,020 --> 03:44:13,640
To attract the purports!

3687
03:44:14,600 --> 03:44:15,640
It'll get them excited.

3688
03:44:15,800 --> 03:44:20,060
They'll see the fleshy color and be like, This reminds me of...

3689
03:44:20,060 --> 03:44:20,740
of skin!

3690
03:44:23,080 --> 03:44:23,820
You know?

3691
03:44:24,100 --> 03:44:25,820
Oh, I forgot to do this.

3692
03:44:26,900 --> 03:44:27,140
Oops.

3693
03:44:27,560 --> 03:44:29,040
I hope nobody was swimming in there.

3694
03:44:30,520 --> 03:44:31,540
Uh oh, we got people drowning.

3695
03:44:47,600 --> 03:44:49,200
The hot dogs make me hungry.

3696
03:44:54,340 --> 03:44:57,120
Okay, now we gotta work on our decoration.

3697
03:44:58,500 --> 03:45:00,380
And then we'll be a three stars!

3698
03:45:02,700 --> 03:45:04,420
Three star park!

3699
03:45:04,860 --> 03:45:05,460
Is that trash?

3700
03:45:07,020 --> 03:45:08,040
Oh, no, that's my thing.

3701
03:45:10,780 --> 03:45:11,340
Nice.

3702
03:45:14,000 --> 03:45:15,020
Stinky man!

3703
03:45:15,380 --> 03:45:15,760
You're right.

3704
03:45:16,080 --> 03:45:16,700
Good job, guys.

3705
03:45:18,920 --> 03:45:20,340
Ronin is drowning!

3706
03:45:22,240 --> 03:45:22,600
Where?

3707
03:45:22,660 --> 03:45:23,540
Oh.

3708
03:45:25,740 --> 03:45:27,600
No sense of urgency at all.

3709
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:32,100
Ice.

3710
03:45:33,440 --> 03:45:33,600
Alright.

3711
03:45:33,900 --> 03:45:36,480
Now let's add a little bit more decoration over here.

3712
03:45:39,540 --> 03:45:39,960
Are you?

3713
03:45:41,320 --> 03:45:41,920
Beatrice!

3714
03:45:44,480 --> 03:45:45,760
I'm bullying her.

3715
03:45:47,280 --> 03:45:48,380
Wait, I think she likes it.

3716
03:45:49,240 --> 03:45:51,060
I think she likes it.

3717
03:45:51,360 --> 03:45:51,880
Another one?

3718
03:45:52,340 --> 03:45:52,640
Another one?

3719
03:45:53,620 --> 03:45:54,880
Nope, not you.

3720
03:45:55,240 --> 03:45:55,600
Was it you?

3721
03:45:56,520 --> 03:45:58,820
Wow, the ladies are freaky today.

3722
03:46:00,040 --> 03:46:01,260
Goodness gracious.

3723
03:46:04,360 --> 03:46:05,160
Mark E.

3724
03:46:05,160 --> 03:46:05,720
Plyer?

3725
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:06,580
What?

3726
03:46:08,160 --> 03:46:10,020
I have Mark E.

3727
03:46:10,020 --> 03:46:11,960
Plyer waiting for lemonade.

3728
03:46:13,500 --> 03:46:14,660
No pictures of him.

3729
03:46:15,460 --> 03:46:16,360
Oh my god!

3730
03:46:16,620 --> 03:46:17,960
Oh, he's buff.

3731
03:46:19,120 --> 03:46:20,660
Why is he so buff?

3732
03:46:24,840 --> 03:46:26,240
I love him.

3733
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:27,500
I hear another pervert.

3734
03:46:28,220 --> 03:46:30,660
But honestly, I don't care that much anymore.

3735
03:46:36,660 --> 03:46:36,780
Where?

3736
03:46:37,480 --> 03:46:38,740
They're taking pictures somewhere.

3737
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:40,200
I can't tell where, though.

3738
03:46:43,060 --> 03:46:44,900
Let's do some...

3739
03:46:45,660 --> 03:46:47,180
We'll do some...

3740
03:46:47,180 --> 03:46:47,480
Oh, wait.

3741
03:46:47,540 --> 03:46:49,660
I remember these don't...

3742
03:46:49,660 --> 03:46:50,060
Dang it.

3743
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:50,880
I already bought it.

3744
03:46:51,340 --> 03:46:52,740
They're cheap.

3745
03:46:52,980 --> 03:46:54,340
They don't really give you anything, though.

3746
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:57,000
We'll do some more trees.

3747
03:46:57,860 --> 03:47:10,200
we'll do some more trees for aesthetics uh flower but no maybe this the umbrella we'll just add some random umbrellas for aesthetics

3755
03:48:35,400 --> 03:48:36,420
No, neither of you.

3756
03:48:37,120 --> 03:48:37,340
Oop.

3757
03:48:43,610 --> 03:48:44,530

3758
03:48:44,710 --> 03:48:45,770

Team!

3760
03:48:48,210 --> 03:48:48,790
Mm-hmm.

3761
03:48:58,290 --> 03:48:58,970
Add lemon.

3762
03:49:07,030 --> 03:49:08,290
What did you want?

3763
03:49:08,310 --> 03:49:09,050
Oh, just lemon in.

3764
03:49:09,230 --> 03:49:09,450
Okay.

3765
03:49:10,110 --> 03:49:11,210
I see more stank.

3766
03:49:15,350 --> 03:49:17,810
Ah, I'm tired now.

3767
03:49:18,530 --> 03:49:19,790
I'm ready for the day to be over.

3768
03:49:20,510 --> 03:49:21,510
Just one more hour.

3769
03:49:24,070 --> 03:49:26,430
This is the threest park I've ever done threed in.

3770
03:49:26,830 --> 03:49:27,670
Look at that!

3771
03:49:28,390 --> 03:49:30,270
Right there, and somebody's drowning.

3772
03:49:30,530 --> 03:49:31,230
Hold on, Brian.

3773
03:49:33,210 --> 03:49:35,790
We don't want people uncomfortable by the stench.

3774
03:49:36,610 --> 03:49:37,650
Where are you over here?

3775
03:49:44,260 --> 03:49:45,500
I'm tired now.

3776
03:49:46,100 --> 03:49:46,580
I'm tired.

3777
03:49:46,720 --> 03:49:48,060
It's almost been four hours.

3778
03:49:48,200 --> 03:49:48,840
Holy moly.

3779
03:49:51,380 --> 03:49:53,020
Oh wow

3780
03:50:03,740 --> 03:50:05,840

03:50:09,660 --> 03:50:15,860
Oops Sorry I didn't see you there Oh sorry

3782
03:50:26,900 --> 03:50:28,440

3783
03:50:29,140 --> 03:50:29,840

3786
03:50:44,280 --> 03:50:45,780
Why do you have a devilish face, Ronan?

3787
03:50:46,380 --> 03:50:49,200
I saved you from drowning and you're a cheater?

3788
03:50:50,080 --> 03:50:50,500
No!

3789
03:50:50,740 --> 03:50:51,100
No!

3790
03:50:51,660 --> 03:50:51,660
No!

3791
03:50:57,840 --> 03:50:58,980
Pound his butt.

3792
03:51:02,820 --> 03:51:04,780
Pound it in the butt at the water park.

3793
03:51:09,950 --> 03:51:11,370
Oh, we made it!

3794
03:51:14,880 --> 03:51:15,940
We did it.

3795
03:51:17,500 --> 03:51:19,140
We made it to three stars.

3796
03:51:22,380 --> 03:51:22,400
Ah.

3797
03:51:24,460 --> 03:51:25,380
Look at all this.

3798
03:51:26,460 --> 03:51:27,840
Short range taser.

3799
03:51:28,440 --> 03:51:34,140
Unlock a close range electric taser for quick non-lethal non-lethal crowd control.

3800
03:51:46,520 --> 03:51:48,060
What else we got here?

3801
03:51:49,640 --> 03:51:51,600
Even more Pinka of vendor training.

3802
03:51:52,500 --> 03:51:53,340
Baseball bat.

3803
03:51:53,440 --> 03:51:57,420
Each park manager should at least have one Why is it $3,000?

3804
03:52:00,180 --> 03:52:01,220
Poster marketing?

3805
03:52:02,000 --> 03:52:04,760
Oh, that's what the poster is.

3806
03:52:06,800 --> 03:52:07,620
Resort pools!

3807
03:52:08,420 --> 03:52:09,480
We're almost to the pools.

3808
03:52:10,040 --> 03:52:14,120
Keep the paths cleaner and safer by minimizing the amount of water left behind.

3809
03:52:14,180 --> 03:52:15,580
Wait, that's kind of huge too.

3810
03:52:15,980 --> 03:52:16,600
Look at that.

3811
03:52:18,680 --> 03:52:20,440
And I'm going to the resort pools.

3812
03:52:21,140 --> 03:52:23,280
I can't afford them right now, but...

3813
03:52:25,280 --> 03:52:29,480
Perhaps Minto was the third star all along.

3814
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:34,220
It's made from oak wood imported straight from heaven.

3815
03:52:35,360 --> 03:52:36,140
Lifeguard staff.

3816
03:52:36,280 --> 03:52:39,880
I'm not buying any more staff because I still have...

3817
03:52:39,880 --> 03:52:40,300
Wait!

3818
03:52:42,240 --> 03:52:42,960
Maintenance?

3819
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:47,480
Hiring level 3.

3820
03:52:47,880 --> 03:52:49,140
We need the modern showers.

3821
03:52:50,680 --> 03:52:53,460
Okay, now we can get one more person.

3822
03:52:55,360 --> 03:53:00,280
I want the taser.

3823
03:53:08,510 --> 03:53:09,030
Victor.

3824
03:53:14,410 --> 03:53:15,910
Whoa, break it down now!

3825
03:53:16,470 --> 03:53:17,130
Whoa, go!

3826
03:53:23,250 --> 03:53:23,770
It's...

3827
03:53:23,770 --> 03:53:27,110
Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin, Braylin!

3828
03:53:37,380 --> 03:53:39,180
Don't go in there.

3829
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:01,300
I received a fine!

3830
03:54:03,340 --> 03:54:05,380
She's not even in my park!

3831
03:54:09,400 --> 03:54:09,540
Oops.

3832
03:54:11,740 --> 03:54:12,280
Is she fine?

3833
03:54:13,920 --> 03:54:15,940
