It's so weird.

Like everything's so like different like here in Akihabara.

302
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,990
It's not where I usually perform.

303
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,910
Well, it's also like just different looking.

304
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,130
Like it's not, it's like a more magical Akihabara.

305
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,010
Right, everybody?

306
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:05,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,610
Very magical.

00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,090

It's not like, oh, I'm a dog.

Oh, I'm a bird.

324
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:54,990

You are.

326
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:56,890
Yes.

327
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,710
I'm not a dog.

328
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,610
Oh, I'm a ghost.

329
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,770
Why are you saying that?

330
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:04,250
Okay.

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,450
Okay.

334
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:06,830
Okay.

335
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,110
The first situation.

336
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:09,930
Yes.

337
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:10,510
Okay.

338
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,190

342
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,130
I'm observing.

343
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:14,570
Okay.

344
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,180
Wait, it's somehow that looks familiar.

345
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,240
I don't know what it is.

346
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,460
Um, um, um, um, uh, oh god, I'm bad.

347
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,040
Are you doing like a, like a lasso?

348
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:30,960
You're like a cowboy.

349
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,700
You're a cowboy?

350
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,140
No?

351
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,060
On the horse?

352
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,300
No.

353
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,680
Um, um, um, um.

354
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,160
Close, close.

355
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,900
You're ringing a bell in the church.

356
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:45,960
No, you're...

357
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,880
How is that close?

358
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,140
You're the lady that does shame.

359
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,620
How was that close to cowboy?

360
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,460
You're close to cowboy.

361
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:55,860
Oh, okay.

362
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,040
What's close to a cowboy?

364
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,640
Hand-training.

365
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,540
Hand-training?

366
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,380
Maybe cowboys, it's not a horse.

367
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,500
Not a horse.

368
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,120
It's a donkey.

369
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,020
You're a shrek.

370
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,380
Okay, it's not a horse.

371
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,260
Is that a donkey?

372
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,140
What else can you ride on?

373
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,580
It's really crazy.

374
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,660
It's like throwing me up.

375
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

376
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,200
It's a rodeo machine.

377
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,380
Bing boy.

378
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,420
I know.

379
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:32,680
Okay.

380
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,540
I know where you got that from.

381
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,220
Okay.

382
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,360
One point for me, I guess.

383
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:37,740
Okay.

384
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,100
Well, I mean, you got a lot of hints.

385
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,280
So is it really a point if it's like...

386
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,660
Wow.

387
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:43,980
Okay.

388
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,880
We'll see how it goes with my...

389
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,200
Okay, okay, go dojo.

390
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,660
Okay, three, two, one, start.

Okay, okay.

393
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,100
Yeah.

394
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,180
Okay.

395
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,860
I can't...

396
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,860
You're a comedian.

397
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,060
You're a clown.

398
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,260
You're showing off...

399
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,220
Oh, you go to a store, a department store, and they tell you the dress that it looks good on you.

Your turn.

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:49,900
Me too.

406
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,220
Okay.

407
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,520
This is a situation.

408
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,040
Mm-hmm.

409
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:52,600
Okay.

410
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,140
Start.

411
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,720
Situation.

412
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,120
Uh, you're literally at my concert supporting me.

413
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:00,760
No?

414
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,060
Oh, you're like really far.

415
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,860
You're at, you're at Holofus, but you're, you have a seat really far in the back.

416
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,380
You can barely see the idols on stage.

417
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,000
No?

418
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:10,760
Okay.

419
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,600
Well, you are an otaku.

420
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,640
You're like a fan, right?

421
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,920
Like a...

422
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,220
Uh-huh.

423
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,600
You're holding a sign.

424
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,120
You're trying to have the idol see what's on your sign.

425
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,660
Or you just see you.

426
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,120
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

427
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,440
Oh, you're ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.

428
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:34,860
It was a fan who was not, who was trying to get Fansa from their idol, but she wouldn't give Fansa to them.

429
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,380
So he's like, oh, she's like jumps, the jumps.

430
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,120
When you're really desperate.

431
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,100
Yeah, yeah, desperate.

432
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,580
Here, here, here, here.

433
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,700
Me too, come on here.

434
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,300
Yeah, but it's bad.

435
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,260
Wow, you got it though.

436
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,040
You got it.

437
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,180
Biffon, biffon, biffon.

438
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:50,840
Biffon, biffon!

439
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,980
Okay.

440
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,400
Okay.

441
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,100
The situation?

442
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,640
Yes.

443
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,060
Okay.

444
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,980
No.

445
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,440
No.

446
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,020
It's a...

447
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,000
It's a thing.

448
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,680
A thing.

449
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,140
Some people...

450
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,460
Whatever.

451
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,280
You'll see.

452
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:06,840
Okay.

453
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,320
Okay.

454
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,230
Um...

455
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:17,770
Um...

456
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,470
Um...

457
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:21,450
Hmm?

458
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,230
Hmm?

459
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:28,170
Hmm?

460
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,990
What?

461
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:32,910
Wait, wait?

462
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,290
Oh, okay.

463
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,110
Wait, wait.

464
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:39,230
Oh, okay.

465
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:40,050
I don't know what it is.

466
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,190
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

467
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,150
Look closely.

468
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:42,990
Okay, okay, okay.

469
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:43,670
Okay.

470
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,890
Wait, you have to also consider I'm left-handed.

471
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:48,570
Maybe.

472
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,210
Okay.

473
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:49,970
No.

474
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,310
Okay, wait, look, look.

475
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,310
I did this, right?

476
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,410
What do I have in my left hand?

477
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,450
Hint, hint, hint, hint!

478
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,970
What do I have in my left hand when I go like this?

479
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:06,690
Scissors?

480
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,230
You did this!

481
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:09,910
You did this!

482
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:10,650
Yeah!

483
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:11,450
Similar.

484
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,330
Here, I take a fresh one.

485
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:16,670
Take a fresh one.

486
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,210
I give up.

487
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,330
I give up!

488
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:18,630
I give up!

489
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,550
No, no, no, no, no, no!

490
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,570
This is so easy!

491
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,150
Okay!

492
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:22,890
Do you guys get it?

493
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,330
Hint is I'm in the restaurant.

494
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,090
Yeah, I guess you're making a food.

495
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,010
Not making it.

496
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,330
I was served the food.

497
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,030
Oh, okay.

498
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,270
Okay.

499
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,270
So here's the food.

500
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,690
Okay.

501
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,970
Here is...

502
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,550
What is this?

503
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:35,430
A spoon.

504
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:35,810
Yeah.

505
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,110
And here I have the...

506
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:39,910
The...

507
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,590
Oh, the men?

508
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:43,570
The...

509
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,210
The noodles?

510
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:44,730
The chopsticks?

511
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,470
The chopsticks?

512
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,250
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

513
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,750
Okay.

514
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,010
Okay, now you know that.

515
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:50,990
So...

516
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:51,690
Takoyaki.

517
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,590
Ice cream.

518
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,050
Do you want to know it?

519
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,090
Yeah, I want to know it.

520
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,950
It's making a mini-rame.

521
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,090
Mini?

522
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,290
That's what I do.

523
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,570
That's how I eat ramen.

524
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,910
Like, I put everything on the ramen spoon.

525
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,010
And then...

526
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,390
Ah, it's a very Kiara-specific...

527
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,590
You don't get a point!

528
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:20,230
I win!

529
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,710
He had a no-katee!

530
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,450
But I want to hear the rest too!

531
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,750
Wait, my last one?

532
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,090
Yeah.

533
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,210
And then my last one, I want to hear that one.

534
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,770
