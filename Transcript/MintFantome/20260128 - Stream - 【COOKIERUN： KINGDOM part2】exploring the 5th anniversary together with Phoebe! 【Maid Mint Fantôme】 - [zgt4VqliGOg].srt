Welcome back!

3
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,330

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,170

5
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,370
Long time no see!

6
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,150
Did you get taller?

7
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,730
I don't remember the last time I was here.

8
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,270
There's nothing happening in this place before.

9
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,970
The place before.

10
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,050
Thank you guys so much for sticking around and welcoming
people that didn't catch part one.

11
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,070
Thank you!

12
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,850
It's...

13
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,710
Cookie Run Kingdom 2 Electric Boogaloo Time!

14
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,930
Electric Boogaloo Time!

15
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,190
Yeah.

16
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,590
But...

17
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,930
We were chatting a little bit before starting up stream.

18
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,270
After this, do you guys...

19
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,390
Did you guys know that Phoebe will be playing Winnie the
Pooh's home run derby?

20
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,010
Like, the masochist that she is?

21
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,630
Like...

22
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:39,890
Ah!

23
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,050
Calling me!

24
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:48,910
like this I look it's I've been trying to beat Winnie the
Pooh's home run derby like I would play it for almost every

25
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:59,710
anniversary since I started streaming and I was never able
to make it all the way to the end but today I'm going to try

26
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:09,050
again um the problem though and I was telling you meant this
is that it saves your data on the browser right like it's a

27
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:20,770
browser game so save there and last time people oh no sorry
go ahead oh yeah last time people watched me play was back

28
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:27,250
in november it was like right after we had done the densetsu
debuts and i had a different computer at the time so yeah

29
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:35,850
you switched recently and now i have a new you see yeah i
switched recently and i realized that all of my Winnie the

30
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,490
Pooh's home run derby data is gone.

31
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,450
So yay.

32
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,170
I was dying.

33
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,210
Yeah.

34
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,110
I was speed running trying to get back to the level that I
was at before.

35
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,090
There's like eight levels.

36
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,210
Some of you have watched Minto play it before.

37
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,750
But there's like eight levels and I had made it through six
of them last time.

38
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,170
I beat Owl.

39
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,750
And then I made it to Tigger, I think.

40
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,130
And then I couldn't beat Tigger, so I stopped there.

41
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,150
But today, today I like one, like I one tried everything
except for Owl, and I'm still stuck on Owl.

42
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,970
So we're a little behind, but we want to go.

43
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,560
Suffering continues, but, but after I beat it, I'll be free
from the curse.

44
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,440
Finally.

45
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,160
After all these years.

46
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,800
And all you have, you have just, you just have Owl, Tigger,
and Christopher Robin.

47
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,880
You got this.

48
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,960
Yes, just them.

49
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,940
Just them.

50
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,340
I got this.

51
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,960
Thanks for believing in me, Mimic.

52
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,900
Of course.

53
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,040
Someone does.

54
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,480
Someone does.

55
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,180
Honestly.

56
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:52,840
Thank you.

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,160
Thank you.

58
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:03,200
Like, for those who don't know that game, it's truly the
rage game of all time.

59
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,980
Like, I don't know how it's a kids game.

60
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,380
children actually played this and beat it that's like kind
of crazy to think about i think a lot of game like older

61
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:22,740
games were purposefully difficult like just to just to be
like see look you can't just beat our game and in two hours

62
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,520
you have to spend time and effort and you have to you have
to really understand the train in the mountains under

63
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,740
waterfall yeah dedicate your life to studying the blade, the
Winnie the Pooh's home run blade.

64
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,060
The bat.

65
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,340
The bat.

66
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,720
Yes.

67
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,040
I studied the bat.

68
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,780
Weeks of fun.

69
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,480
I studied the bat.

70
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,740
Weeks of fun.

71
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah, it definitely kind of artificially inflated the time
of how long a game would be to beat.

72
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,360
But this one, Winnie the Pooh's home run derby is like an
online flash game.

73
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:16,060
so why did they have to make it on the disney website why
and it has persisted because of it i know who hurt them a

74
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:27,720
baseball definitely apparently baseball yeah yeah baseball
goodness gracious see i believe in you for sure thank you

75
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,720
thank you I just want to be a gamer like you, Minto.

76
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,740
Like me?

77
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,060
Wait, wait.

78
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,020
Like you.

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,900
How am I a gamer?

80
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,440
Because you made it all the way to Christopher Robin.

81
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,780
I haven't yet.

82
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,860
But I didn't beat him.

83
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,440
Maybe I should also do a, like, a rematch against
Christopher Robin.

84
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,840
What do you guys think?

85
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,880
I believe in Minto.

86
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,420
I don't know if I believe in myself, but I believe in you.

87
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,040
But, you'll be able to, like, kind of work up to him a
little bit.

88
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,120
I feel like I won't.

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
Like, I will forget everything, and then it will be so
difficult.

90
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,780
It's okay.

91
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,340
It's...

92
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,100
We're playing Winnie the Pooh's home run derby is, like,
riding a bike.

93
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,380
It comes back to you.

94
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,180
It could have been years, and then it comes back to you
because it's been engraved into your neurons.

95
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
So true.

96
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,820
Oh, my gosh.

97
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,420
Wait, some people are saying we could race once you catch
up.

98
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,180
today but like well unless i beat him today but i i don't
know if i have that confidence would you want to though if

99
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:44,540
you have to beat owl i could yeah you know what because i i
am streaming a lot later than i normally do so what i could

100
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:55,520
do is i could beat owl hopefully beat tigger no stop at
christopher robin yeah then we could race yeah i'm down i

101
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:05,680
have to see i'll have to see if i'm back it otherwise i will
have to replay the whole thing and i training it's your

102
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,980
training yeah my training all right well that's the thing
because christopher robin is like all of the moves combined

103
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:21,060
so that's terrifying yeah i didn't even know that because i
haven't gotten that far it's so scary

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,180
i there was a there was somebody else that i watched like it
was two Hollow Live members that did like a racing.

105
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,920
It was, I think it was ASCII and Korone?

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,680
And they did like a racing of like uh it was some other rage
game.

107
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,020
Um, what game was it?

108
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,540
Oh my gosh.

109
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,240
Uh, I think it was- I wouldn't be surprised if it was
betting over it or something.

110
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,540
It's something very similar.

111
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,160
It was something very, very similar.

112
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,540
And so they raced and it was, it seemed pretty fun.

113
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,380
So, it wasn't getting We could do that.

114
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,080
Prize.

115
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay.

116
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm excited.

117
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,860
I'm not.

118
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Don't get that far.

119
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,700
Don't get excited yet.

120
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't get excited.

121
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,920
You're going to play the game.

122
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,000
You're going to play the game tonight and then be like, you
know what, Min?

123
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,960
I don't think we can.

124
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't think we should do this.

125
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,740
Yeah, we'll see.

126
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,820
We'll see how I feel.

127
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,600
We'll see if I am too a little bit.

128
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,640
too traumatized.

129
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,140
Oh, it was a Sisyphus.

131
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,400
Yeah, yeah, it was Sisyphus.

132
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,300
I can.

133
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,440
Oh, Sisyphus.

134
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,480
Have you played that one?

135
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,920
Oh, that is a rage game that I haven't played yet.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
No, I played Only Up.

137
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,100
I played Getting Over It.

138
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,740
Have you played Sisyphus?

139
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,580
Yeah, I almost beat it.

140
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Oh, almost?

141
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,180
Almost.

142
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,600
I believe in you.

143
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,520
You could do it.

144
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
No, I don't- If you ever got back to it.

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,600
But that's a question of if you want to.

146
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:58,900
too?

147
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,060
I think I'm good.

148
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,020
I think I'm good.

149
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,580
Love yourself.

150
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,040
Love yourself a little more.

151
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,020
Yeah, like mint here.

152
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,940
Mint is, like, this is a good example of self-respect and
dignity.

153
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,860
Yeah, I was like, before stream, I was like, man, maybe I
don't feel satisfied by not beating Christopher Robin.

154
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,960
And then I was like, you know what?

155
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,560
No, I think I...

156
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,420
I think I'm okay.

157
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,180
You're good?

158
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,100
Yeah.

159
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,500
Maybe you're okay.

160
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:37,500
What's the worst kinds of games are like Are like rage games
like that That don't have like a Like you beat the game and

161
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:46,020
it's just like Like just a screen that says congrats You
beat the game like just that you know That's it So you would

162
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:53,240
expect something a little bit Just a little bit more Just a
little bit After all of that heartache Have you ever seen

163
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,600
like the ending that is That is from Getting over it?

164
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,740
like you solemnly swear you are not streaming

165
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:12,380
no no so then people like turn off their streams at that
point yeah yeah i've never i've still never seen it yeah

166
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:24,020
that's so interesting oh i know i wonder why it's a secret
it makes me want to see it but i'm like i don't want to put

167
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,600
in the effort and then also if i'm If I beat it, I'm going
to get carpal tunnel.

168
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,640
If I beat it, then also...

169
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,020
I have nobody else would be able to watch it on my stream.

170
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,060
Cool.

171
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,280
Cool.

172
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,440
That's so sad.

173
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,500
You went through this whole journey together, and then you
can't go to the end together.

174
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,060
Yeah!

175
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,440
We should ask Nimi.

176
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:52,860
Oh.

177
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,900
We should ask Nimi what it is.

178
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,060
Nimi's beat it.

179
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,520
Yeah, Nimi's speed on it.

180
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
When Nimi was playing it, Her name is...

181
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,680
Oh my god, I remember.

182
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,960
We should!

183
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,040
We should just be like, Nimei!

184
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,860
What's the ending?

185
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,620
Tell us, please?

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
We have like big sparkling eyes.

187
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,480
We're like, please, please, please, tell us, tell us the
ending.

188
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,460
Please, please, Nimei, please!

189
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,200
And she'll be like, Oh yes, kid.

190
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,700
I can imagine, I should be like, yes, kid.

191
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,400
Mmm.

192
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
Yeah, she'll...

193
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,880
I don't know, you guys.

194
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,400
You should play with us.

195
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:42,260
the game that was good oh i don't know maybe you should
maybe you should just play and get your stuff yeah she'll

196
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,320
say she'll tell us that it's only worthy for for people that
beat it

197
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:59,400
i mean what if it really is that life-changing what if it's
that like that satisfying of an ending.

198
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,240
I feel like Only Up is the kind of game that would have an
unsatisfying ending.

199
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,880
You'll go all the way up there and then it would be like,
congrats, and then they would have like a time on it and it

200
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,160
would show you the ridiculous amount of time that you've
just been trying to get up.

201
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,040
Nah.

202
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,620
I don't know.

203
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,460
I've never beat, I've never, I think actually most rage
games I've never beat before.

204
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,940
Like Jump King and Only Up.

205
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,520
Actually, I've never tried Only Up.

206
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,260
Most of them I don't think I've ever been.

207
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Yeah, now that I think about it.

208
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,240
How's Jump King?

209
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,700
I've heard about it, but I actually haven't seen any
gameplay of it myself because I was gonna like try to play

210
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,280
it myself.

211
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:53,340
I would say, I would say of all the, of all the rage games,
it's like the most relaxing.

212
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,180
Really?

213
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,140
Oh, yeah.

214
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,580
Oh.

215
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,540
Like, because it's just, I don't know what it is.

216
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
I will keep that in mind, then.

217
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,540
This, it might be, it might be a controversial opinion, but
it's just, it's, you know, it's just like a, I don't know.

218
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:16,080
There's just something very calming about, like, the
ambiance in it, and, yeah, people are saying it's, like, a

219
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,640
quality rage game.

220
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,800
It's calming rage.

221
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,280
Yeah, it's just something about it.

222
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,620
That's like, yeah, I don't know.

223
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Calming rage.

224
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,940
Calming rage.

225
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,200
Maybe that's it.

226
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,600
Maybe that's my rage.

227
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,220
game that I need to play.

228
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,040
Phoebe's perhaps.

229
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,100
Well, there's another one.

230
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,780
Did you play did you play Emomushi when that came out?

231
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,540
Emomushi?

232
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,900
I don't think so.

233
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,300
No, wait.

234
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,570
No, I didn't.

235
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:47,570
I didn't.

236
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,630
That one was like a little bug.

237
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,090
Yeah, yeah, I haven't.

238
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,690
I haven't.

239
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,050
Oh, that one was a very Phoebe core raid game.

240
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,430
It is very... I'm looking at it right now.

241
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:09,390
I want to get back to it sometime It was very silly Very
cute But also I was not very good at it But I think It at

over again.

245
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:37,310
No, not the freaking, not like the freaking Winnie the
Pooh's home run derby BGM, which everyone is going to have

246
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,530
burned into their minds by the end of tonight.

247
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:50,350

Boom, boom, bam.

264
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,010
I got this.

265
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,510
Oh, yeah.

266
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,270
Every single cookie unlocked.

267
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,990
Well, there's quite a few people with every single cookie
unlocked, actually.

268
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,390
Well, you were saying that you joined an older server,
right?

269
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,150
And so that you, like, when you first started, so there were
already some, like, super powerful people in your server

270
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,810
that you joined.

271
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:57,910
Right.

272
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:04,350
It started January 2021, and I joined pretty early, but I
think it was like mid-year 2021.

273
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,810
So there's some people that have, like, a few months on me.

274
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,850
And then because I took a little bit of a break, I don't
have some of the newer cookies unlocked, personally.

275
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,450
And those are all the ones, like...

276
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,050
Are they the meta?

277
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,590
I was talking to my housemate about the meta, and she was
like, yeah, they're the meta.

278
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,970
She was like, here, let me help you build your PvP team.

279
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,550
And then I look, and I have, like, one of the cookies in the
meta.

280
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,050
No!

281
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,210
No!

282
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,270
But if everybody uses that, I gotta catch up.

283
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,950
But game is super generous.

284
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,590
Yeah, you were saying that.

285
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,890
Let's see if it's back up.

286
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah, game is very generous, so I think we'll be able to...

287
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,430
Oh yeah, I think so.

288
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,530
I think it just came back up.

289
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,010
Let's see.

290
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,590
I will refresh my game as well.

291
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,390
I've had mine open too.

292
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,170
Let me turn off my music here.

293
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,310
I think it's ending in...

294
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,290
It says in 10 minutes for me.

295
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:06,630
Okay.

296
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,530
They said around this time for me.

297
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,550
So we can do another 10 minutes or so.

298
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,450
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,110
Okay, close.

300
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:17,730
Goodbye, Q.

301
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,390
Yeah.

302
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,510
All good.

303
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,200
All good, all good, all good.

304
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,120
All good, all good.

305
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,760
all good.

306
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,440
Yeah, there's these codes over here that Minto put on the
screen.

307
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Yes.

308
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,500
And whether you're starting new or you're coming back to the
game like me or you're just in the middle of playing it,

309
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,000
don't forget to enter your codes.

310
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,580
Enter your code.

311
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,340
There's a website for it.

312
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,460
Enter your code.

313
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,140

314
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,100
Yes.

315
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:02,260
I mean, I think there's a way to do it in the app too, but I
just like use Um, they have like a website for it as well.

316
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,620
So I use it and then I just plop all the codes in and it's
real fast, real easy.

317
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,360
And they're giving away so much because it's the five year
anniversary.

318
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:10,700
Exciting.

319
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,160
That's half a decade.

320
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,040
I can't believe it's been that long.

321
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,260
Oh my gosh.

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,180
Isn't that crazy?

324
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,780
What were you doing five years ago?

325
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,160

Oh.

So, I mean, we could try.

340
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,580
We could be the most powerful.

341
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,780
We could, maybe.

342
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,540
Take over.

343
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,720
We could be the most powerful.

344
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,860
Take over.

345
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,780
They've reworked the whole guild battle system in recent,
recent, over the past like year or something too.

346
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,420
So, yeah.

347
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,080
There's so much more to do.

348
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,840

Can I bribe you with some cookies, please?

358
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,120
They're very delicious cookies.

359
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,420
Made with Phoebe's very famous recipe.

360
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:48,940
Yes.

361
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,420
Definitely no secret ingredients or additives in it.

362
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,160
Nothing suspicious whatsoever.

363
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,280
Wait, what do you add?

364
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,580
Love.

365
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,780
I knew you were gonna say that.

366
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,460
Come on, Phoebe, we gotta get deeper.

367
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,200
We come home, ho, Phoebe, we gotta cook.

368
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,440
We gotta cook, Phoebe, we gotta cook.

369
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:14,840
Phoebe, we gotta cook.

370
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,300
We gotta bake.

371
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,120
We gotta bake.

372
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,540
We gotta bake.

373
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,220
Sorry,

374
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,250
I'm still on my breaking bad high.

375
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,870
Okay, Mr. White.

376
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,310
Okay, Miss Fantome.

377
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,710
Okay, Miss Fantome.

378
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,590
Time to cook cookies.

379
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,510
Yeah.

380
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,310
They call her Mint White Fantome.

381
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,650
Mint her White.

382
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,570
Mint her White.

383
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,290
Yeah.

384
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,590
That's so cursed.

385
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,450
Yeah.

386
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,330
Oh, yeah.

387
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,830
Okay, Mentor White.

388
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,810
Yes, good, good.

389
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,470
I'm going to have my ending.

390
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,350
Instead of, like, what was it, Bluebird or whatever, I'm
going to have, like, strawberry jam.

391
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,030
I just...

392
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,730
Strawberry jam.

393
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,710
Yeah.

394
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,530
I love your summary of Breaking Bad, by the way.

395
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,130
Yeah.

396
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,810
Wait, have you watched the show?

397
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,010
I've seen some...

398
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,950
I didn't get very far though.

399
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,910
I'm...

400
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,430
I wonder if there's a happy ending to it.

401
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,390
It was stressing me out.

402
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:35,990
I mean, it's good.

403
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,290
It's really well written.

404
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,830
It's good.

405
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,310
It's popular for a reason, but...

406
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,810
It is a good ending.

407
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,530
It is a good ending.

408
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,090
Okay, okay, good, good.

409
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,110
I'm just...

410
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,730
I was like...

411
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,430
peak stress when I was watching it.

412
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,950
I was just like, oh god, oh god.

413
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,430
Oh, that's so... that's so...

414
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,290
That's so sussy.

415
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,570
I know, it really is.

416
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,730
Yeah, it is a happy ending.

417
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,930
He's just trying to pay his bills, man.

418
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,950
He's trying to...

419
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,550
Yeah!

420
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,910
Relatable struggles to anybody in this day and age.

421
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,930
Anybody can relate to Breaking Bad.

422
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:19,450
We do not condone the actions of Walter Wise.

423
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:20,970
Everybody?

424
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,930
In this sponsored stream.

425
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,410
We do not.

426
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,110
Yeah.

427
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,070
We're talking about cookies, everybody.

428
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,230
Cookies, cookies.

429
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,250
Cookies.

430
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,590
We're cooking cookies.

431
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,110
We're baking.

432
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,230
Yeah, we're baking.

433
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,810
We're cooking.

434
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:40,810
Yeah.

435
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,030
Well, why is it called...

436
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,270
Why are they called cookies when you bake them?

437
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:49,990
Bakeies.

438
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:51,810
Bakeies.

439
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,710
Why in of the oven?

440
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,430
When there was a bacon, you call bacon when you cook it.

441
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:57,850
Oh.

442
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,790
Oh yeah, oh my gosh.

443
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,190
And then cookies when you bake them.

444
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,650
What was the of in the oven again?

445
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,030
Yeah, of when you in of the...

446
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,510
Why do they call it of in?

447
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,250
Why do they call it oven?

448
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,350
When you...

449
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,770
Oven the cold food.

450
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,690
Of out hot eat the food.

451
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

452
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,550
I still don't understand.

453
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,250
I don't understand after all this time.

454
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:46,790
Why do they call it oven when you oven in the cold food of
out hot eat the food?

455
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,490
Because it's the oven.

456
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,760
What's the hot eat the food?

457
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,060
That's the out in.

458
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,320
That's the out.

459
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,380
That's the out.

460
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,660
That's the out.

461
00:27:59,660 --> 00:27:59,980
That's the out.

462
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,140
That's the out.

463
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,860
That's the food.

464
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,440
That's the cold food of in.

465
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,460
The of in is the cold food.

466
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,760
Of out is the hot food.

467
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,060
Well, why is it hot eat the food?

468
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,920
Because it's hot.

469
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,700
It's got to go into the of in to become hot.

470
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,860
And then of out eat the food hot.

471
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,720
You're right.

472
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,900
So he's saying that...

473
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,800
That it should be called an...

474
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,420
It should be called an of out.

475
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,960
Yeah.

476
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,920
Well, you oven.

477
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,620
You oven.

478
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,860
The cold.

479
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,440
And of out.

480
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,840
The of out part is when you, it's hot and you eat the food.

481
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,540
Yeah.

482
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,920
I think I smell toast.

483
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,400
Are you hungry?

484
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,300
It's not a toasting stream.

485
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,920
It's a baking stream.

486
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,280
You should smell cookies, not toast?

487
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,740
Yeah.

488
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,660
Toaster.

489
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Toast.

490
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:19,780
What?

491
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,900
You can put other things in the toaster.

492
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,360
Yeah, have you guys tried putting things besides toast in a
toaster?

493
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,420
I mean, besides, like, toaster strudels or pop tarts or
something?

494
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,480
Because those are supposed to go in the toaster.

495
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,520
Wait, they are?

496
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,560
Things that are not supposed to go in the toaster.

497
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,740
I've put in a bagel.

498
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,460
Who's going to the toaster?

499
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,320
I do.

500
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,840
No, not like a fork.

501
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,740
Don't do that.

502
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,460
Why am I seeing...

503
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,140
Don't put a fork.

504
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,180
No, not a fork!

505
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,580
Why am I seeing hot dogs multiple times?

506
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,400
How are you gonna...

507
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,280
Why a hot dog?

508
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,240
What do you put?

509
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,420
What if you put in...

510
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,680
Okay, what about a pizza slice though?

511
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,300
I saw a...

512
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,800
Oh!

513
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,280
Pizza slice, that's for now, yeah.

514
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
That could do it, maybe.

515
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,200
Sometimes microwaving it doesn't cut it, so maybe toasting
it.

516
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,320
Do we...

517
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,180
Do we...

518
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,900
Do you put the hot dogs in sideways or vertically?

519
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,660
Uh...

520
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,120
I feel like if you wanted it to grow...

521
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,320
If you wanted it to cook all the way through, putting it in
sideways.

522
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,620
Sideway.

523
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,040
Vertical.

524
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,380
And then...

525
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,460
Right, because if it was vertical, the top would just be
sticking out.

526
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,820
Yeah, but probably.

527
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,140
If you put it in vertically, you could put like five of
those babies in there.

528
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
You're right, and then you just flip them over and do it
again on the other side.

529
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Oh, big ring!

531
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,740
You could do it!

532
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,960
Because if you put it in sideways, how would you get it out?

533
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,900
How would you get it out?

534
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,860
Why?

535
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,350
The maintenance!

536
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,810
The maintenance!

537
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,450
It's over!

538
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,170
It's over!

539
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,510
An update is available.

540
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,650
Wait, an update?

541
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,950
Wait, hold on.

542
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,730
I'm opening the game.

543
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,510

544
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,730
What I'm gonna do...

545
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,730
I think...

546
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,050
Let's see if I need to update.

547
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,110
If I need to...

548
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,190

549
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,450

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,560
So what I had to do was I had to close it out fully.

552
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,380
Okay, okay.

553
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,300

00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,020
Milky Way was one of them.

787
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:31,940
Milky Way.

788
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:32,660
Which one?

789
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,560
They are very good cookies.

790
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,120
She might be...

791
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,560
She will be one of these epic ones.

792
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,580
Oh, my God.

793
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,640
I love this outfit.

794
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,220
It's so cute.

795
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,440
Such a good outfit.

796
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,080
It is.

797
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,700

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,060
Yeah.

800
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,860
This is an original default.

801
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,580
Epic outfit is so good.

802
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,320
She's a maid for one of the super epic cookies.

803
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,200
Right.

804
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,440
So, I think Milky Way is probably...

805
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,740
Well, she has one of these epic cookies.

806
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,540
I guess we could keep scrolling.

807
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,280
Keep scrolling.

808
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,860

809
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,320
Yeah, keep scrolling.

810
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:05,720
Okay.

811
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,620
You'll recognize her even with the other outfit on.

812
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,780
Oh, there, on the far right.

813
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,600
Far right.

814
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,400
No keyway.

815
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,020

816
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:15,700

The default.

820
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,640
Oh, my God.

821
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,880
Wrong sleeves, right?

822
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,520
Yeah.

823
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,200
No, she's so cute.

824
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,260
She's my favorite.

825
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,600
It was so stinking cute.

826
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,240
Fourth anniversary outfit.

So we do have the other outfits.

830
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,460
And if you go to the far left, and you go down a little bit.

831
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,320
Not that one.

832
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,840
Next one.

833
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,820
That one's the one voiced by Horea Yui in the Japanese
version.

834
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,440
Cotton cookie.

835
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540

836
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,280

Frost cookie, like whatever Frost cookie or whatever.

It was different.

864
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,980
Or go to World Map, maybe.

865
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,740
Because there's, like, the regular story.

866
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,020
Yeah.

867
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,640
At some point, they change chapters to the Beast East.

868
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,520
Right, right.

869
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,020
Oh, you know what?

870
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,140
This is on Crispia.

871
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,780
And then the other continent is Beast East.

872
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,580
So if we go to the bottom left to World Map, maybe it'll be
there.

873
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,840
Sorry, there we go.

874
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,360
There it is.

875
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,040
There it is.

876
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,260
Yeah.

877
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:19,940
Beesies.

878
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:20,780
Beesies.

879
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

880
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,420
Oh, my gosh.

881
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,400
Our team, they look so strong, too.

882
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,860
Right, right, right.

883
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,780
Are you ready to guide me into the ultimate battle?

884
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,280
I will do my best.

885
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,400
I'll do my best.

886
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:33,800
All right.

887
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,180
Look at our words stacked, though.

888
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,400
I think we'll...

889
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,400
I think we got those.

890
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,740
I think we can do it.

891
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,520
I think so.

892
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,300
Okay.

893
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,960
Oh, my gosh.

894
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,020
They look so beautiful.

895
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,160
Start.

896
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,260
Yeah, let's just start anyway.

897
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,300
Let's go!

898
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,100
Phoebe, General Phoebe.

899
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,300
They're running!

900
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,300
The cookies are running!

901
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,560
Oh, you could put it...

902
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,120
What you dreamed of giving to cookie kind?

903
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,280
It was freedom.

904
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,940
Spoiler alert to some people.

905
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,320
Spoiler alert!

906
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,560
Boom!

907
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,400
It means nothing to me anymore.

908
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,760
The voice acting, though.

909
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,380
The VA is so good, too.

910
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:15,740
Right?

911
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:16,780
No.

912
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,520
I'll just turn it on.

913
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,740
Yeah.

914
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,260
Quite little cookie.

915
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,000
Get back.

916
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,800
Charcoal cookie.

917
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,760
Silent salt cookies.

918
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,500
Blade cross this entire hall.

919
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,540
Wall to wall.

920
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,400
And left slash marks so deep, you can't see the bottom.

921
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,820
You can't see the bottom.

922
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,800
Oh my god.

923
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,100
Resonating with his rage.

924
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:45,600
Yeah.

925
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,140
Freedom!

926
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,220
Freedom!

927
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,660
Freedom!

928
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,480
Even restored, it will not mend your power and spirit cut in
half.

929
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,780
The soul jams are like super strong artifacts.

930
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,800
There's only the five for the ancient cookies like White
Lily Cookie.

931
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:10,020
I may have failed, but I was given one last chance to undo
my wrongs.

932
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,440
To make things right, I need to know about the power of the
witches that you used.

933
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,440
A cookie.

934
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,640
See, cookie run is serious.

935
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,220
Cookie run is serious.

936
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,340
Oh my goodness.

937
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,440
Really is.

938
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,300
It's no different from those of the vile beasts.

939
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,340
Oh my goodness.

940
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,180
We're totally, like, thrown into the middle of the story,
everyone, so don't feel bad if you don't know what's going

941
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,560
on.

942
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,020
But it's just kind of, like, a...

943
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,360
Yeah.

944
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,100
Giving you a little bit of a taste, though.

945
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,820
So without getting into too much spoilers, White Lily...

946
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:55,160
cookie like went, she wanted to discover why she was, or why
the cookies were born, why they were baked.

947
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,440
And then she looked into it too much and was, found out why
they were baked.

948
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,160
And it was shocking knowledge to her.

949
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,980
It was like forbidden knowledge for a reason.

950
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,920
And it sent her into dismay.

951
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,100
Yes.

952
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,920
Oh my gosh.

953
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,840
But I won't say anything else.

954
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,460
It is very, as extensional as, I will be born.

955
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,320
Actually, it's so intriguing.

956
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,640
Like, right?

957
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,560
Oh, my gosh.

958
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,620
Alright, I am going to skip ahead, though, so that we do
have time to fight.

959
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,260
Oh, my goodness.

960
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,160
Wait, I think we're, like, okay.

961
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:27,620
Oh, hold on, Otto.

962
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,540
Go on, Otto, real quick.

963
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,380
Otto!

964
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:32,500
Yeah.

965
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,620
And then, oh, oh, this is nice.

966
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,280
They set you up with, like, the meta treasures on the right
side.

967
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,060
I think we're, like, extremely okay.

968
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,700
Stuff that, like, maybe you can pull down.

969
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,700
Yeah.

970
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
This is like...

971
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,120
Easy.

972
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,860
That was GG easy.

973
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,680
Oh my gosh.

974
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:53,060
Yeah.

975
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,760
The dream team.

976
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,700
The dream team.

977
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,760
I wish I was that strong.

978
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,220
So yeah, the cookies do run.

979
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,260
They do run.

980
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,020
And so you can run through...

981
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,880
You can run through the whole newest episode.

982
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,460
Oh my gosh.

983
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:08,740
Wait.

984
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,540
The story actually sounds so awesome though.

985
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,460
So...

986
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,520
There's a boss at the end of every level.

987
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,680
Every 30 levels.

988
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,320
a blast?

989
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:17,720
Ooh.

990
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:18,660
Ooh.

991
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,340
Spooky.

992
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,880
This is so long.

993
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,360
Wow.

994
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Look at the little dogs.

995
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,740
Right.

996
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,520
Look how cute they are.

997
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,060

998
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:28,640

Okay.

1021
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,860
That's more than an epic, though.

1022
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,320
That's something else.

1023
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:25,860
Wait.

1024
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,280

1027
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:35,540
What the?

1028
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,620
Cookie in space.

1029
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:39,840
What?

1030
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,680
What could it be?

1031
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,960
What could it be?

1032
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,280
What could it be?

1033
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,460
Because also that was a...

1034
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:56,600
of cookie cutter that i haven't seen very much before so
something quite rare is gonna come out we did get the epic

1036
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:23,940
cookie wow look at that cute wow I feel like we were so
close.

1037
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,340
Nice.

1038
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,400
Muscle cookie.

1039
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,460
Muscle cookie.

1040
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,820
Oh, they're so cute.

1041
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,160
I haven't seen Black Something cookie before.

1042
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:33,900
Black Sapphire?

1043
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,600
Black Sapphire, yeah.

1044
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,380
But we did not get Dark Enchantress cookie.

1045
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,020
So, again, again, again.

1046
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,320
And there are even rarer cookies than Epic.

1047
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,600
That we can get.

1048
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,540
That's a good sign.

1049
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,300
Streamer luck, everybody.

1050
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:57,580
So I think at the beginning, it's like if you see a bunch of
rare friends pop up, then that means that there's going to

1051
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,000
be...

1052
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,200
We're going to get multiples of the rare cookies.

1053
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,700
Good sign.

1054
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,320
We got one.

1055
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,800
Epic or higher.

1056
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,460
Angel cookie!

1057
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,460
So cute.

1058
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,940
So the soul cores, they're to unlock the cookies or what
they're doing.

1059
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,580
What kind of, like, when you get a Soul Core?

1060
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:27,020
Either to unlock them if you don't have them yet, or to
upgrade them.

1061
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,240
This is an epic, I think.

1062
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1063
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,960
I don't think this is her, but...

1064
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,180
I love these intros.

1065
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:34,980
They're so fun.

1066
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:36,720
Yeah.

1067
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,060
Werewolf cookie?

1068
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:45,040
I feel like I should- I wonder how some of these cookies
would taste.

1069
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,900
A werewolf cookie!

1070
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,860
Kind of hairy.

1071
00:55:51,940 --> 00:56:07,200
He looks like so Don't talk to me, me Angi Let's see Again,
again Again, again Again, again Come on, give me the hard

1072
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:20,940
eyes Dang it You could skip this one probably I think so,
we'll skip Skip, skip, skip, skip That's alright.

1073
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Again!

1074
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,120
Again!

1075
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,720
Again!

1076
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
Wait, many people showed up.

1077
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:30,940
Oh!

1078
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:36,260
Wait, we've only done a couple polls and like we're already
getting so many epics.

1079
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,140
This is kind of awesome.

1080
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,400
I know, right?

1081
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,160
I like that the cookie smashes the table.

1082
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,980
If you press tip in the top right, then it'll maybe stop
when you stop at an epic.

1083
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,400
Oh, wait!

1084
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,320
Oh, we already got it.

1085
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,220
So this is the one that we just got.

1086
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,120
Oh, is this gonna be...

1087
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,920
This might be...

1088
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,440
Oh, yes, it's the diver one.

1089
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,740
Diver cookie!

1090
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,060
Oh, cute.

1091
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,500
Candy Diver.

1092
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,980
Candy Diver cookie!

1093
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,180
So cute!

1094
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,900
Oh, my God.

1095
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,100
I love that it looks like a little candy bowl, like his
head.

1096
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,120
I know, right?

1097
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,440
It's so cute.

1098
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:14,680
Very cute.

1099
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,760
Very, very cute.

1100
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,920
The designs are so, like, creative.

1101
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:19,200
Oh, okay.

1102
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:26,900
and then on the bottom oh sorry okay i went too fast see
what we get i saw that i could claim it i did you're so

1103
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:38,420
strong i am excited yeah you can claim it here i'll just
skip it this one yeah here so now yeah if you claim that on

1104
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:47,580
the bottom left that just gives you more currency more free
currency to pull you'll get guaranteed stuff from like doing

1105
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,360
more pulls but then after 200 250 pulls, you get, like, a
good...

1106
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:51,840
You get pity.

1107
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,400
You get the... Yeah, 250 is the pity.

1108
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,060
So this is just one of the gotchas.

1109
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,020
This is the witch, the enchantress.

1110
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,200
Yeah, enchantress.

1111
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,500
I don't think so, yeah.

1112
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,540
I only saw...

1113
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:02,560
Yeah.

1114
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,820
Ginger Brain show up, so...

1115
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah.

1116
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:06,460
Yeah.

1117
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,040
Alright.

1118
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,560
Again!

1119
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,480
I love Ginger Brain, but...

1120
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,100
Again, again!

1121
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,120
Wait, wait.

1122
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,200
Three guys came out.

1123
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,740
Three guys came out.

1124
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,100
Oh, but it'll just be rare, I think.

1125
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,380
Just a rare, I'll Oh.

1126
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,260
Just rares.

1127
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,060
Oh.

1128
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,280
I'll skip her.

1129
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:23,820
It's okay.

1130
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,860
Skip her, skip her.

1131
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,440
Still precious friends.

1132
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,220
Oh, so cute.

1133
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,160
They are really cute.

1134
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,300
Come on, Dark Enchantress.

1135
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:35,860
Come home.

1136
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,920
Come home, come home, come home, come home, come home.

1137
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,100
It's just rares.

1138
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,920
Oh, it's rares.

1139
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:43,720
Yeah.

1140
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,800
Do games, or do, do poles flip usually?

1141
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,020
Is that a chance for that?

1142
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,980
Not at this point.

1143
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,060
Not at this point.

1144
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,180
Okay, okay.

1145
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,580
Okay.

1146
00:58:59,660 --> 00:58:59,880
Again.

1147
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,920
Gotcha, and this is so fun, though.

1148
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,680
It's so, it's so, like, animated, which is really exciting.

1149
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,840
Like, it makes you be like...

1150
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,280
It is.

1151
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,760
We got more stuff!

1152
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,380
Yay!

1153
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,060
Wow.

1154
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,240
So much stuff.

1155
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,080
Two friends.

1156
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,340
Two friends.

1157
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,780
Yeah, like this is the point where it can flip.

1158
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,160
Yeah.

1159
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,320
Oh, so it just did...

1160
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,240
We got at least one.

1161
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,460
At least one.

1162
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:42,540
Bang!

1163
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:44,960
Bang!

1164
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,220
I love it.

1165
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,040
It goes to space.

1166
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,320
I'm gonna...

1167
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:50,420
Oh.

1168
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
No, it wasn't this one.

1169
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,020
Oh my gosh.

1170
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:53,720
Cute!

1171
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,740
Also cute.

1172
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,260
There's so many cute cookies.

1173
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,200
I don't want to skip, though, because...

1174
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,120
Cute.

1175
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:07,920
This is the one, right?

1176
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,820
There you go.

1177
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,240
This is the one.

1178
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,060
There we go.

1179
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,000
It's going to be an epic.

1180
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,640
Oh, it's them!

1181
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,440
My gosh.

1182
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:18,940
Them.

1183
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
That's Choco Cookie!

1184
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,180
Choco!

1185
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:27,060
I don't feel like you've ever seen one that's like two
cookies in one.

1186
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:27,880
Yeah!

1187
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,920
So stinking cute.

1188
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,840
So baby.

1189
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,760
Yeah, they come with a little intro screen.

1190
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,960
It's so fun.

1191
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:39,780
Nope.

1192
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,800
Okay, that was like an NG poll.

1193
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:44,240
Yeah.

1194
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,880
It happens, it happens.

1195
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,480
Oh.

1196
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:51,420
Oh!

1197
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,700
I was hovering over the skip.

1198
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,180
Yeah!

1199
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,440
Do you think it'll be...

1200
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,680
It'll... she'll do the hard eyes?

1201
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,440
Or do you think we'll get...

1202
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,320
Something else?

1203
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,180
That's the best I've ever seen is those eyes.

1204
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:07,580
Yeah.

1205
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,780
But if she's...

1206
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,480
But who knows if they've added more.

1207
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,580
Because it's different from an epic cookie.

1208
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,640
It could be different.

1209
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:15,480
Right.

1210
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,380
Well, typically...

1211
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,380
You'll be able to see the...

1212
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,740
Oh my god, this one is cute too.

1213
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,200
Oh my god, the panda!

1214
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:26,920
The rock star!

1215
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,160
Rock star cookie!

1216
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,220
Rock star cookie!

1217
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,020
There's a whole rock festival event at some point.

1218
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,360
And there was like a song that came out with it too.

1219
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,300
Oh my gosh.

1220
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,140
Oh wow, we just got 60 out of 60 for him.

1221
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,240
Eh, he can level up.

1222
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:46,740
Yeah!

1223
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:50,440
Keep going.

1224
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,700
We keep going.

1225
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,640
More sparkly eyes.

1226
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,100
We're getting so many epics though.

1227
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:58,860
Right?

1228
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,940
The point at which you can see what kind of a cookie you get
is like, uh, when...

1229
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,240
In a little bit.

1230
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:10,860
So...

1231
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:16,760
When these start popping up, like when they come out of the
oven, you can like tell if like the dough looks a little

1232
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,240
different.

1233
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,060
Oh.

1234
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,720
So we've seen the epic ones so far.

1235
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,820
And, you know, the rare and stuff.

1236
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,820
It'll be even fancier looking.

1237
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,700
Fancy dough.

1238
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,140
Fancy dough.

1239
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,760
Look around cookies, cookie.

1240
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:36,860
Okay.

1241
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,860
Yeah, it's like at this point.

1242
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,860
This looks like an epic as well.

1243
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:43,740
Whoa!

1244
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,140
Madeline cookie.

1245
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,180
I believe.

1246
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:52,920
Come on.

1247
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,520
Dark Enchantress cookie.

1248
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,880
At the end of each pull.

1249
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,060
We also then also have to pull for Moldo cookie as well.

1250
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,960
There's so many other cookies too.

1251
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,420
How many other banners and stuff?

1252
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,200
I know.

1253
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,920
There's like so many events as well and everything.

1254
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,860
Fruit juice cookie.

1255
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,260
Yeah.

1256
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,140
Oh, these are the outfits too.

1257
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:19,920
The epic outfits.

1258
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,760
I kind of want to do some outfit polls as well.

1259
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,120
Yeah, this is the one and this is the video I showed in the
last stream, but we'll watch it again.

1260
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,820
Master needs no script.

1261
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,620
They brave the stage.

1262
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,920
Brave the stage.

1263
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,860
But me!

1264
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:41,840
But me!

1265
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:42,400
But me!

1266
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,680
But me!

1267
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,920
But she has the popular skin.

1268
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,940
in a tragedy of his own making

1269
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:13,480
I love her look so cute She's so cute Let's try it, I want
to pull Eternal Sugar Cookie Oh, so cute There are different

1270
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:20,680
points at which you can see how good the gotcha is here too
Okay So this is like as though we got some rares basically

1271
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:29,700
Okay, okay Cut We'll do it, we'll do the first one
Everything is so animated.

1272
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,020
But kind of like...

1273
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:31,580
Yeah.

1274
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,080
Funky rainbows.

1275
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:37,940
Cute!

1276
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,320
For poison mushroom cookie.

1277
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,040
Wait, I've got to do another one.

1278
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,780
Wait, this is so cute too.

1279
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,240
I want to see like a rare one.

1280
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:48,640
Or epic one, I mean.

1281
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:50,440
Right.

1282
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,860
So this is also just normal.

1283
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Yeah, this is just normal as well.

1284
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,280
We must, I want to see, I want to see.

1285
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,540
Mm-hmm.

1286
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,520
More, more, more.

1287
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,080
I believe we have a little bit of currency left.

1288
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,040
Yeah, we don't have too much, but...

1289
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,900
It seems to be okay so far.

1290
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,540
Yeah, it also seems pretty normal.

1291
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:21,600
Oh my god, I was about to be like, what happened to you?

1292
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,620
Oh, I love herb cookie though.

1293
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:24,860
Herb cookie is...

1294
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,420
He's one of my favorites.

1295
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,880
Okay, come on.

1296
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,560
Oh, I noticed the outfit outside was different.

1297
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:36,100
Yes.

1298
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,540
At that point, and then also at that point, and then at the
point where you see the kind of thread going around.

1299
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1300
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:44,940
So this is just like normal.

1301
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:45,540
Okay.

1302
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,080
So we were getting pretty lucky getting rares before.

1303
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:50,820
Wow, nice.

1304
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,900
Right, right, right.

1305
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,500
Yeah, because the dress in the window was different.

1306
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:56,880
Let's see, there's my...

1307
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh!

1308
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:57,400
Oh!

1309
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,800

1310
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,200
Oh, there!

1311
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:05,680

1312
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:06,300

1313
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:06,560
There!

1314
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,560
We got...

1315
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,940
That's either...

1316
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,600
But it can either be, like, an epic or, like, one of the
current... Yeah.

1317
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,220
Uh, yes.

1318
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,720
So, but hopefully we get one of the two featured outfits.

1319
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:18,720
Oh?

1320
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:21,600
Ah!

1321
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,540
Fellflower Hall.

1322
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,540
It's so pretty.

1323
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,580
It's so pretty.

1324
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,920
Oh, I really wanted Eternal Show.

1325
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,540
Oh, no.

1326
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:35,800
That's okay.

1327
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:36,900
No more.

1328
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,380
It's okay.

1329
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,060
We got it.

1330
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:39,820

Yeah, we have Eye on the Prize.

1336
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,940
Come on.

1337
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,860

She's so cute.

01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:31,650
Stick and cute.

1344
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,830
But now you're getting so fast at knowing if it's a good
point.

01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,190
Oh!

1346
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,290
Yeah, that's a good sign.

1347
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,430
That's a good sign.

1348
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:40,330
That's a good sign.

1349
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:41,630
Guaranteed at least in Epic.

1350
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:42,050
Yeah.

1351
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,270

Sorry.

1356
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,380
I didn't see if he was a different thing other than Epic or
what.

1357
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:01,940
Carrot cookie!

1358
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,900
Three of them.

1359
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,480
Holy moly.

Oh boy.

1361
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:21,420

like we don't... neither of us get to keep this account,

1362
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,660
but...

1363
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,200
No.

1364
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,020
Oh, we get to experience the joy of...

1365
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,400
New cookie.

1366
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,320
That's why the boys... Whoa!

1367

We got him!

1372
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:41,030
Command me!

1373
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:41,400
Command me!

1374
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,090
Command me!

1375
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,630
Command me!

1376
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,170
Command me!

1377
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:50,810
This one's epic!

1378
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:51,350
Wait!

1379
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,170
We got him twice!

1380
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:59,650
Which would be if this was an account that you could keep
very good?

1381
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:01,590
Because then you get this person for me!

1382
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:02,170
Yeah!

1383
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:02,610
Yeah!

1384
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:05,230
Wait, we still have a third one.

1385
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,150
We have a third one.

1386
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,250
What if it's three in a row?

1387
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:09,270
Wouldn't that be crazy?

1388
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,210
That'd be crazy.

1389
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,610
That'd be so crazy.

1390
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,130
I was secretly hoping.

1391
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,470
Oh, it's mango, I think.

1392
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:19,010
Maybe?

1393
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:19,750
Grapefruit!

1394
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:22,030
Grapefruit!

1395
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:22,650
Cute!

1396
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,190
Oh, they're cute.

1397
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,410
Oh my gosh!

1398
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:28,270
Oh my gosh!

1399
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,890
I got moldy dough cookie!

1400
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,880

01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:46,320
bowl dough cookie ghetto but my enchantress come on please
we have just a few more just a few more ten full or 11 more

1402
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:54,840
ten I think this one was a no good yeah yeah we'll zoom
through it we'll zoom oh claim all I think what do you do

1403
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:01,180
with the extra cook it will upgrade them because they need
to be like just like in any other gotcha game they can get

1404
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:04,340
stronger and stronger with the more copies you have of them.

1405
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,720
So it's worth having other copies.

1406
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:07,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1407
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,860
That's typically how a lot of gotcha games were.

1408
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,220
I'm skipping.

1409
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:13,860
Rare.

1410
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,480
Alright.

1411
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,580
We have eight more tries.

1412
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,520
Alright, come on.

1413
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:19,580
Oh, come on.

1414
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,780
It's the desire meter.

1415
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
They know I want her.

1416
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,000
It is the desire meter.

1417
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,400
Ah!

1418
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:29,870
Sweet!

1419
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:33,430
She is?

1420
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:35,590
She is extra, extra rare though.

1421
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,370
Yeah, I just want to see her intro, so bomb.

1422
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:40,090
I know, right?

1423
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:41,090
I want to hear her voice.

1424
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:44,130
No!

1425
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:49,830
I shall become more terrifying than any witch.

1426
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,210

1427
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,870

1428
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,240
She's so awesome.

1429
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,340
Yeah, don't think too hard about that animation.

1430
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,500
Don't think too hard about it.

1431
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,380
I do not see it.

1432
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:14,840
I do not see.

1433
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,700
You are prepared to look into darkness.

1434
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,520
Wow!

1435
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,440

So awesome.

1437
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,740
Wait, it only showed Ginger Brave, though.

1438
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,440
I didn't think that we would...

1439
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,720
Wow, we did it!

1440
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,140
I know, Rob.

1441
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,040
Well, there was that second point at which it can flip.

1442
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:35,740
That's true.

1443
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,240
So I guess it flipped for you.

1444
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,400
I was too eager.

1445
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,660
I was too eager.

1446
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:43,540
Wow!

Dark Enchantress Cookie.

1473
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,120
A mold dough cookie.

it they are so cute they're so cute they're like uh they've

cookie.
