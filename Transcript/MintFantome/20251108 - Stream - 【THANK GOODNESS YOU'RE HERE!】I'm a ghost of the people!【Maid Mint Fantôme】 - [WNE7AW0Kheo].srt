00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,690

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,190
Anyway.

91
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,810
I'm sorry, love.

00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,210
Mr. Mayor's in the meeting.

93
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,050
Because we're meeting the mayor.

94
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,530
Why are we so small?

95
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,370
But if you just sit there, I'll let you know when he's ready.

96
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,050
All right, love.

97
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,250

105
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,090
I can visit Barnesworth.

106
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,230
I can knock.

107
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,390
Excuse me.

108
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,730
Excuse me.

109
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,330
Excuse me.

110
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,010
Nice to see a game that's willing to have a protagonist canonically the same size as Mint Real Live.

111
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,590
Hello, Minky.

112
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,490
This game is wild.

Oh my gosh, wait!

123
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,840
They said visit Barnsworth, but they did not say that I couldn't vandalize Barnsworth.

Oh, I'm doing the mowing.

182
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,320
I love you.

183
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,460
I love you.

184
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,180
I get how cute.

185
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,580
I love you.

186
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,280
I love you.

187
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,780
I love you.

188
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,080
It's like a horror movie.

189
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,100
He's getting closer and closer.

190
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,880
Oh my god.

191
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,540
I love you.

192
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,180
I love you.

193
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,200
I love you.

194
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,840
Oh, just mowing that gravel.

195
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,100
Good job, little guy.

196
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,980
Oh my gosh.

197
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,900
I did a good job.

198
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,040
I mowed the grass.

199
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,700
That is a fine statement.

200
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,540
Oh look, they're still here.

201
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,180
Wait, why did I mow the grass?

202
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,780
this part.

203
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,060
Yeah, I did a good job.

204
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,880
Oh, I broke it.

205
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,340
Wait, why is it broken?

206
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,360
What did I do?

207
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,020
Sometimes I just step in, like, gum or something.

208
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:58,740
It's terrible.

209
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,300
I did it!

210
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,360
Nice firm grip on that mower, lad.

211
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,220
I tell you, Reggie's wife could learn a thing or two.

212
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,820
Reggie's wife taking strays.

213
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,500
Polite notice.

214
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,760
Hello, big lies.

215
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,980
Who's saying silly me?

216
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,740
How do you do, young man?

217
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,060
Hi!

218
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,100
Almost done, and then I can finally get home to my puzzles.

219
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,160
I love puzzles.

220
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,980
No chance of any of them around here, though.

221
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,380
Oh.

222
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,600
Oh, where are you?

223
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,240
Well, I guess no breakfast for me.

224
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,480
I guess not.

225
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,600
It sounds like a you problem.

226
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,180
One rot, two rot, three rot.

227
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,540
Oh my gosh!

228
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,360
This is so lovely!

229
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,780
Rats are rats and we are the rats!

230
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,600
What's this?

231
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
Parked vans.

232
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,840
Never caught moving.

233
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh, oops.

234
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,060
I wonder who Florence and Colin are.

235
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,740
You need help?

236
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,960

240
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,810
There's so many sound effects everywhere.

241
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,330
Oh my gosh!

242
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,270
Dang I'm getting right in between the legs.

243
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,950
Oh Charlie, I hope he gets that tuppence.

244
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,370
Perhaps you might see about sourcing some lubrication.

245
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,290
The butter!

246
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:49,930
The butter!

247
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,250
She is... is that her Oh.

248
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,070
Um...

249
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,670
We gotta...

250
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,160
Maybe there's a tuppence in here.

251
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,420
What is a tuppence?

252
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,000
Is that a currency?

253
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,680
Okay, let's see.

254
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,320
Find the keys.

255
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,780
Maybe I can find them somewhere.

256
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,880
Sorry.

257
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,820
No?

258
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,760
Are you awake?

259
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,530
At the top pence.

260
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,370
Two pence.

261
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,130
Oh.

262
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,050
All that for two pence.

263
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:41,810
Hmm.

264
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,370
I'm just hopping along.

265
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,490
Don't mind me.

266
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,430
Oh, no.

267
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,470
My wife could let me think I'll do.

268
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,260
She could.

269
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,220
She could.

270
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,820
Oh, silly me.

271
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,180
Oh, silly me.

272
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,480
Where am I supposed to find the keys?

273
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,260
If I hit them enough, maybe they come out.

274
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,720
There's so many bugs in this town.

275
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,080
Not the burglar.

276
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,640
Oh,

277
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,820
I can hit everybody.

278
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,260
Find a locksmith.

279
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,440
You're right.

280
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,960
But what's a locksmith look like?

281
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,640
Is this the locksmith?

282
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,380
Oh, wait.

283
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,020
Maybe this place opened too.

284
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,600
Aha!

285
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,360
Oh!

286
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,720
That looks like a locksmith's car!

287
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,520
Oh!

288
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,180
Oh!

289
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,920
Now then, Larry.

290
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,100
How about a cobblest pint, eh?

291
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,980
I was so sorry.

292
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,680
It's like a normal pipe.

293
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,160
But I take both my shoes off.

294
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:08,860
Excuse me.

295
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,580
I love to, Ronnie, but the bee is coming out all flat.

296
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,440
Well, why don't you go down into the center and knock a few bells about?

297
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,820
Slum chance of that.

298
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,020
I don't even know how to get downstairs.

299
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,800
You can't get downstairs in your own blinking public house.

300
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,760
So I gotta go downstairs.

301
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,180
Florence normally does it, but she's off today.

302
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,720
Good morning.

303
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,560

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,920

Yes.

319
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,200

Oh my god, the whole town is here.

334
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,140
It's no use.

335
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,420
Wait, do you think they think it's each other?

336
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,420
He's like...

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,600
She's like, you're so feisty today, dear.

338

Okay, let's head over.

341
00:24:59,170 --> 00:24:59,250

Oh.

346

Put Ronnie in a recovery position.

347
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,790
Is it because he did get his morning pint or...

348
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,310
Didn't?

349
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,930

Cool.

355
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:35,690
Oh.

356
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,330
Darling!

357
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,270
What an earth are you doing with that moth boy?

358
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,550
This poor guy's got a black eye!

359
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,830
My mom's got me back on the Mercury again.

360
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,590
Give me strength.

361
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,490
Oh my god!

362
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,090
Poor little guy!

363
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,270
What do we got back here?

364
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,310
but they're mixed.

365
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,470
Oh, you found me.

366
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,950
I'm the Fridgestote.

367
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,930
And I'm awfully frigid.

368
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,950
Ah, no, I just...

369
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:08,610
I'm actually the town Vole if you catch my meaning.

370
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,210
What?

371
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,030
I...

372
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,030
Not quite sure I understand.

373
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
There we go.

374
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,720
Oh, there we keep going.

375
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,440
and here we keep continuing

376
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,600
oh my gosh we made it

377
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:07,520
I'm glad I censored him eating it on my mark Three, two, one, Eve!

378
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:08,960
How?

379
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,520
Oh.

380
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,920
Ooh.

381
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,400
Did he get it?

382
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,960
Did he get it?

383
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,000
What's this?

384
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,780
Oh, that was very a thruppence.

385
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,100
T'was a thruppence.

386
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,660
Pray tell, young thruppence.

387
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,440
We're best to spend ye.

388
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,540
Hmm?

389
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,060
What hell, what luck?

390
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,240
A wishing well.

391
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,200
It's the thruppence.

392
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,140
Godspeed, young thruppence.

393
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,520
No.

394
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,320
Oh.

395
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,280
What is happening?

396
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,580
Why do I feel like I'm watching like a sketch?

397
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Like a comedy skit.

398
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,120
Uh-oh.

399
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,040
Free Charlie's hand.

400
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,100
Oh, I'm awake.

401
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:49,640
I'm alive.

402
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,100
I'm fine.

403
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,640
Oh, get me out of here.

404
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,180
Wait, why can't I get out?

405
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,200
There we go.

406
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,520
How queer?

407
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,060
Wait, the subtitles were different though, no?

408
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,550
The way they look at each other!

409
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,890
No, no way.

410
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,190
The subtitles are normal English.

411
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,450
They actually translate it.

412
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,690
Oh, who the heck is this guy?

413
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,430
You all right?

414
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,350
What you carrying in there?

415
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,470
Oh, he's got his bricks!

416
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,950
He's got his bricks!

417
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,810
He's all bricked up, as the kids say.

418
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,550
Quite literally.

419
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,710
What else we got around?

420
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,290
This guy is not looking so good.

421
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,310
He's looking real green.

422
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,370
Are you okay?

423
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,510
That far right.

424
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,950
Okay, who else do we need to fix?

425
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,430
Oh, let's go into that hole.

426
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,230
Oh, what's in the police box?

427
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,730
See it, smell it, sword it.

428
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,210
What happened in 92?

429
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,410
Excuse me, sir!

430
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,010
I would like to report vandalism.

431
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:30,670
There's some guy going around the town, literally painting the streets yellow.

432
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,810
All the crime.

433
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,770
What could have happened in 92?

434
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,910
I've never seen a hole as big as that.

435
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,910
We neither.

436
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh, there we go.

437
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,590
He's slapping everything and everyone!

438
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,770
The queen.

439
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:51,490
No!

440
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,450
Lady Diana?

441
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,950
Like Princess Diana?

442
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,850
Do

443
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,330
you think it'll work this time, Jasper?

444
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,510
Oh dear.

445
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,910
Oh, there's no use, Marge.

446
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,870
Roger is a nonce.

447
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,490
How have you been cooking fish and chips all this time?

448
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,050
Oh, I just do a cold fry usually.

449
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,830
Hang on a minute.

450
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,610
A cold fry.

451
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,950
Where's the Blinken Spanner?

452
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,630
Stop yelling at me!

453
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,550
It'll be that senile old fishmonger fish down at the market.

454
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,110
You better get down there and find it.

455
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,410
Or it'll be cold chips till the cows come home.

456
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,630
Oh, sorry.

457
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,370
There's just a little man in here instead.

458
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,390
Roger's wife could learn a thing or two.

459
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,370
I didn't walk right for a week last time.

460
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,410
And that vinegar smells only just washed out.

461
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,830
Salt yourself.

462
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,290
What'd they do?

463
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,150
Wait, what's he mean by that?

464
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:07,550
Oh?

465
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,370
What?

466
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,010
What happened?

467
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,470
Wet.

468
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,110
chips.

469
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,230
Marge's menu.

470
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,090
Fish and chips.

471
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,070
Ten bob.

472
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,670
Fish or chips?

473
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,470
Ten bob.

474
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,610
Can of pop.

475
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,550
Ten bob!

476
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,830
The prices are too high!

477
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,410
Kids steal.

478
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,210
Just eat some of your mums.

479
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,610
And the health and safety rating.

480
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,570
They're piss poor.

481
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,010
I think we gotta get out of here.

482
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,310
Wait, where are we?

483
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,070
I don't recognize this.

484
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,570
Where are we?

485
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,450
Oh, two of them, two of them!

486
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,250
Three of them!

487
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,630
Wait, one, two, three.

488
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,410
Driving school.

489
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:12,030
Both goes on the bridge, hands at half by seven, but never so gently, best foot forward.

490
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,510
That's okay.

491
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,490
I couldn't get it quite right my first 48 times either.

492
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,390
There's nothing like walking this.

493
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,850
Hello, there's a pedestrian here.

494
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,290
There is a pedestrian here.

495
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,470
Oh my gosh, wait.

496
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,130
This is a parking meter.

497
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:29,590
Give me your cash.

498
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,770
Give me your cash.

499
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,710
Lester packs lunches.

500
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,510
Lester, that guy can't even pack a punch.

501
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,970
Good day, Minto.

502
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,610
It appears there's a super...

503
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,590
Typhoon!

504
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,570
Here in the next few hours, so I might not be able to tune in the next week through the power outages.

505
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,070
I need to know if there's plans for a Minto figure in the future.

506
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,330
I don't have any plans for a Minto figure in the future.

507
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,730
Sorry.

508
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,710
But stay safe!

509
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,070
Super Typhoon.

510
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,250
Bumbley.

511
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:33,260
Council says We're going to get these dogs buried By end of the day Dogs That's just what we call a lame pipe Okay Which is what we call a shaggin Shaggin Humpty Dumpty Sight on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall Oh my bad

512
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,240
No parking No loitering No dogging No

513
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,620
Biff spins.

514
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,700
Their biff is everywhere.

515
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,100
What's the dogging?

516
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,500
It could happen to you.

517
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:54,720
Wait.

518
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,840
I've got a sausage here.

519
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,980
Would you like it?

520
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,100
Here you go.

521
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,540
Ah!

522
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,720
I've dropped it.

523
00:33:59,740 --> 00:33:59,880
Oh!

524
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,720
That's okay.

525
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,960
I've got another.

526
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,300
Oh.

527
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,380
Ah!

528
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,940
I've dropped it again.

529
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,180
It's alright.

530
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,840
I've got some more inside.

531
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,040
Buckinghamoo.

532
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,780
Is it like raw dogging?

533
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm waiting for Bobby Bash to come back.

534
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,900
Looking for a good time!

535
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,120
From 1 a.m., 3 p.m., half to noon.

536
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,220
Oh my gosh, I didn't know this game involved platforming.

537
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,230
Oh my gosh, we're going to the moon.

538
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,460
Oh!

539
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,960
Oh, hello!

540
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,620
Oh!

541
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,000
What have we got here then?

542
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,440
A towel in the owl.

543
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,380
I'm going to move myself over a little bit.

544
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,280
I'll put me down the apples and pay you the jiffy.

545
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,940
Ow!

546
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,120
Still at large.

547
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,520
Ah!

548
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,020
That's a whole lot of soot.

549
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,880
Ah, a fine mess.

550
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,340
Don't bother there, young man.

551
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,340
Help yourself to some scramble bread.

552
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,020
Oh, so, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

553
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,400
Hold on, I just wanted to make myself smaller, a little bit.

554
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,380
Okay, that should be good, I think.

555
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,500
Thank you, sir.

556
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
You have a nice, sturdy house here.

557
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,980
I'm just checking it out.

558
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,640
Making sure that nothing...

559
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,340
Ten bob!

560
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,520
I'm making sure that nothing is...

561
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,060
Um...

562
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,780
Everything is...

563
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,740
In tip-top...

564
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,580
Tip-top shape.

565
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,000
Um, is there anything you want me to do?

566
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh, I can leave.

567
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,870
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

568
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,090
I've been sucking this pipe all morning.

569
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,630
I haven't got a drop out of this.

570
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,150
Oh, hi again.

571
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,250
Gentlemanther here is any crusted over.

572
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,830
We need to dampen that topsoil pronto.

573
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:16,970
Pronto.

574
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:17,450
Oh.

575
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,330
Keep sucking.

576
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,330
Keep sucking.

577
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,650
Wanted for crime.

578
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,850
It's not me, though.

579
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,970
That doesn't look anything like me.

580
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,970
Inspector Minky here.

581
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,530
Just making sure things are up to code.

582
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,250
Slap, slap, slap.

583
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,090
I'm slapping, I'm slapping.

584
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,350
Come on, get in, Durban-time.

585
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,970
Now, all day.

586
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,010
Now, all day.

587
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,170
Now, all day.

588
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,550
Here, I'll help you out.

589
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,630
Get in there, kid.

590
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:48,910
Get in there.

591
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,910
God, the booty cheeks on that guy.

592
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,550
Hmm.

593
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,390
Is there something that is causing...

594
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,870
Oh!

595
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,230
That is causing the water to be stuck.

596
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:06,830
Is it on?

597
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,800
He's all cheeks.

598
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm just making sure everything's in order.

599
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,820
Ooh, strawberries.

600
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,520
Hello.

601
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,540
You know, I love cucumbers, but I cannot stand a snake.

602
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,140
Every time I put one in my mouth, I'm nearly sick.

603
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,980
When you do me a favor, if you see any snails, give them a click around the ear hole for me.

604
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,520
Oh.

605
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,020
Why are you eating the sna- you don't wash your food first?

606
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,820
Sister- oh, no snail zone.

607
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,040
Sue hurts snails.

608
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,380
Oh.

609
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,740
Oh my gosh, I just smushed that guy.

610
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,820
I'm sorry.

611
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,540
I didn't realize I was killing this.

612
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,900
I'm destroying this garden.

613
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,260
Wait, but we have to find some snails, maybe.

614
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm gonna look for one.

615
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,800
Is that a rocket ship on the tree?

616
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,700
Okay, I'm looking for a snail.

617
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm looking for a snail.

618
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,660
I see none.

619
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,340
I think this place is...

620
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,360
This place is clear.

621
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm jumping in.

622
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,660
I'm going in.

623
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,140
I went in!

624
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,280
No, I'll dee!

625
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,770
What could be the problem here?

626
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:43,610
Hello!

627
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:44,770
I'm a w-

628
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,230
It was supposed to be a friendly handshake.

629
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,120
It was supposed to be a handshake!

630
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,260
I promise!

631
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,760
Tunneling for the desperate gardener.

632
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,840
Doesn't

633
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:31,620

635
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,120
What does that say?

636
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,890
I think I fixed it.

637
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,640
Good day!

638
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,900
Oh yeah!

639
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,340
Oh wait, I keep saying good day, but that's not...

640
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,140
Hello!

641
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,160
What's happening in here?

642
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, there's a man in here!

643
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,100
Ah!

644
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:28,960
Sorry.

645
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,840
I have no idea how that got there.

646
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,180
I pull the other one, passing off my spanner as a stiff kipper, is it?

647
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,820
But we've been friends for 40 years.

648
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,840
Why on earth?

649
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,980
The fish, all the fish have cigarettes, why?

650
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,400
Why didn't you scare me the excuses, you fat trout?

651
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm taking this back to my toolbox where it belongs.

652
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,080
Every single fish has a cigarette, why?

653
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,540
Except this guy is...

654
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,280
Fish and Sigs.

655
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,660
Oh, you're right, you're right.

656
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,480
Oh, Bish for fish.

657
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,760
Bish for Sigs.

658
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,400
What's he doing?

659
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,260
That one.

660
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,760
No pies.

661
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,660
Oh, wow.

662
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,500
Hold on.

663
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,440
What's the fish pop?

664
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,140
What's up this about then?

665
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,560
What are you going to do?

666
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,700
What for nobody?

667
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,580
I have a tea.

668
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,460
What fish popped.

669
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,000
Why don't you let's go, Beverly, to make you one?

670
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,280
Empty box.

671
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,260
Just a box.

672
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,220
Hello.

673
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,980
The Crankmaster 2000.

674
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,020
I'll take five.

675
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,620
Doug's rugs.

676
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,520
Is there cigarettes in these two?

677
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,840
Hello.

678
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,120
No more digests.

679
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,480
Can't believe that big one.

680
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,140
No pie.

681
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,600
No pie.

682
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,380
Stop playing with them.

683
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,140
with your food.

684
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:04,980
Doug's the name.

685
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:05,800
Hi Doug!

686
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,400
Where's the rugs at?

687
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,280
I see none.

688
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,960
Oh, here they are.

Your finest rug.

693
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,460
It's just garbage everywhere.

694
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,960
Is this the real?

695
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,340
Is this the real truth?

696
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,360
We've gone too far!

697
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,120

00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,020
I'm dead.

751
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,000

Yu-Gi-Oh!

756
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,220
It ain't like that.

757
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,240
Pokemans.

758
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,780
Beesh is a trout.

759
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,860
No, that's a fish.

760
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,440
You're talking about bish.

761
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,260
The absolute state of this.

762
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,220
It's so true.

763
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,280
What's he doing in there?

764
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,460
Kind of, like, lead tastes kind of sweet in case you were wondering.

765
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,880
I want a pie.

766
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,800

772
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,760
I came in as usual.

773
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,900

Oh, okay.

784
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,100
I think now we can go through the place where the car was.

785
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:22,800
Arby's?

786
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:24,880
Arby's.

787
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,880
They've got meat.

788
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,580
Oh.

789
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,040
Where are we going?

790
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,080
Oh, where are you going?

791
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,800
Oh, there we are.

792
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,400
Oh, we're here!

793
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,720
How did it work out?

794
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,120
Why is it in your pants?

795
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,200
Cracky, look at the size of this lad's marrow.

796
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,180
There's here the tomatoes are a fruit.

797
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,420
Why is it in your pants though?

798
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,160
Curious.

799
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,280
Wait, how do I...

800
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:08,840
Here?

801
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,260
I didn't see any snails, ma'am.

802
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,820
I simply do not like snails at all.

803
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,760
But I didn't see any, did you?

804
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,640
Am I crazy?

805
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,200
The faucet.

806
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,880
Oh!

807
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,100
I didn't realize it wasn't on.

808
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,040

00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,620
I could do that.

813
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,320
I could.

814
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,520
I could destroy an entire ecosystem.

815
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,560
And I'll do it.

816
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,780

Men underfoot.

Oh, hello!

830
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,170
Both my dads were diggers.

831
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:14,450
So there were always spades knocking about the house.

832
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,030
Yeah?

833
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,190

834
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,630

00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:19,730
Okay.

Wait.

837
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,920

838
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,060
Hello?

839
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,460
Oh!

840
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,580
You forgot to lock your door!

841
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,180
Oh my gosh, this guy is taking up the entire front window!

842
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,000
What are you doing that for?

843
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,080
Are you stuck?

844
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,560
Mind that child.

845
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,390
I'll take the Sacrifice.

846
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,110
I'll get electrocuted for you.

847
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,110
Alright, let's go inside that person's house.

848
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,290
Oh.

849
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:07,650
I can't do anything.

850
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,330
I'm useless.

851
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:10,430
Oh!

852
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:11,730
I went through their house.

853
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,590
And we're going through this person's other house.

854
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,770
Oh, and through there.

855
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,370
I'm playing Scooby-Doo.

856
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,230
What's going on?

857
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:25,730
Oh, hello there, young man.

858
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:26,150
Hi!

859
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:27,910
Yep.

860
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:32,910
My drain pipes are all blocked up over there and I need them cleaning out.

861
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,830
Won't you give it a go?

862
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:35,710
Okay.

863
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:36,430
Oh.

864
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:42,680
Hmm.

865
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:47,690
Um.

866
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:51,290
I love you.

867
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,330
Will you marry me?

868
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,330
Who's asking?

869
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,600
Great job!

870
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,100
Oh, we're back in the pipes.

871
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,380
What's wrong with it?

872
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,520
It's only Nancy's new bloody boyfriend.

873
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,220
She's got a new one every week.

874
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,040
All right.

875
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,080
It'll be nice to have a proper sit-down, T.

876
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,840
I'd rather have a sit-down week.

877
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,280
Or be it.

878
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,460
I love eavesdropping.

879
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,440
Anyone here?

880
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,300
Oh my god.

881
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,080
Oh my god.

882

00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,270
in love with the mold.

907
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,610
Do you still love us if we were worms?

908
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,150
Do we kick?

909
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:47,810
Maybe.

910
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,010
Let's kick then.

911
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,230
Just kick then?

912
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:51,610
Let's kick?

913
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:52,210
We'll kick?

914
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,000
I think he's suspicious of me.

915
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,700
I'm kicking better.

916
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:09,910
I'm doing a much better job.

917
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:17,290
Would you join me in filling our bellies with diet, Soda.

918
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,610
Scrabs, I can't drink soda.

919
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,930
So sorry, I can't join you in that endeavor.

920
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,710
Oh, they've locked me out.

921
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,110
I guess I'm not meeting the mayor.

922
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,850
I need not butter.

923
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,970
I need meat.

924
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:35,930
Where was the meat at?

925
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,470
I don't know, love.

926
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,010
We have got bricks at home.

927
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,530
Oh, good make, though.

928
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,590
Still like your bricks?

929
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:50,930
Oh!

930
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,010
Game is more linear than you think.

931
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:58,550
I believe that.

932
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,050
I just don't remember where it was.

933
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:02,550
Oh, wait!

934
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:05,170
Uh...

935
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,870
I just don't remember.

936
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,250
Did I have to go through the hole?

937
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,070
Through here?

938
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,170
The sewer hole.

939
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,070
Okay, so I was right.

940
01:00:35,920 --> 01:01:08,200

941
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,420
Okay.

942
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,260
Darko, thank you so much for the gifted.

943
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,940
Ducky, thank you so much for the gifted.

944
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,040
Mothman, thank you so much for the gifted.

945
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,060
That fry is still broke.

946
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,200
That fry is still broke.

947
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,820
Come on, I'll eat him raw.

948
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,060
Oh my god.

949
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,600
Damn.

950
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,820
My guy's hungry.

951
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,760
Toast.

952
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,740
Kiss the cook.

953
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,360
I get lonely sometimes.

954
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,520
Are you okay?

955
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,740
I do like to have a little look through the window.

956
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,800
Oh, okay.

957
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,660
What window?

958
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,520
Where are we looking through, huh?

959
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:46,740
Huh?

960
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,520
I'm just kind of exploring and seeing what...

961
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,400
Oh, it's Kesa!

962
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,120
I don't know.

963
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,060
Mucky pup.

964
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,420
There you go.

965
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:07,600
I fixed it.

966
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:09,900
The farm.

967
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,640
Oh, wait, we gotta get the screwdriver here, no?

968
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,220
Hello, hello?

969
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,420
Oh, my gosh, this is where the- Oh, thank goodness you are here.

970
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:20,760
Yep.

971
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,380
They're everywhere.

972
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,740
Somebody must have laid them down from the roof.

973
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,040
Oops.

974
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,600
Can you fetch a jackbox of rat poison from top shelf?

975
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,600
Oh, you're asking the tiniest person here, huh?

976
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,880
Oh, my gosh, look at them go.

977
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,900
I've been on my best behavior.

978
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,140
I deserve a treat, not a mouse.

979
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,060
The rats everywhere.

980
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,620
Oh, here we go.

981
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,260
Take your rat poison.

982
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,820
No, I don't want to hurt them, though.

983
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,240
Oh, is that the asbestos?

984
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:46,900
Or...

985
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,020
You're welcome.

986
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,080
Do you have...

987
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,760
A screwdriver here?

988
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,690
Maybe the other direction.

989
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,910
They've gone crazy.

990
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,790
It's because they've gotten sick with power.

991
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,990
Because I enjoyed their...

992
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,650
I enjoyed their...

993
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,170
musical numbers too much.

994
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,590
Employees must wash their teeth.

995
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,170
I hope so.

996
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:23,990
Hello?

997
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:27,330
Wait.

998
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,650
Up to the roof.

999
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:32,490
Oh, can I go up to the roof?

1000
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,790
Did I watch cats?

1001
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,370
Don't ask me that.

1002
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,220
Where are we?

1003
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,120
Oh.

1004
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,060
Yeah,

1005
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,420
they're so cute.

1006
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:02,860
Do your part.

1007
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,720
Leave no bin bag unchewed.

1008
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,220
Borrowed from biggies.

1009
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,180
Remember biggies are not people.

1010
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,300
What biggies ever do to them?

1011
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,780
What's in here?

1012
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:19,920
Yeah?

1013
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:20,800
Let me in.

1014
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,580
I listen to your people.

1015
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,380
the song of your people.

1016
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,010
I'm too small, guys.

1017
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,520
He's got his ration book.

1018
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,540
Beware the basher.

1019
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,520
Stop the stigma.

1020
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,920
Shit everywhere.

1021
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,380
Is there something I'm supposed to do here?

1022
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,740
Oh, there we go.

1023
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:25,450
Yeah, yeah.

1024
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,170
Fancy doing business with you.

1025
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,870
I don't discriminate.

1026
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:34,250
I hit everybody.

1027
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:38,090
We are no longer accepting weird avian nodes.

1028
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,290
What does that mean?

1029
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:40,930
Hello!

1030
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:41,490
Oh.

1031
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,370
What's he pointing at?

1032
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,470
Can I get the screwdriver?

1033
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,130
How do I take it?

1034
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:00,250
Collins keys!

1035
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,570
Oh, there it is.

1036
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:04,250
Okay, cool.

1037
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,160
Carrie Louise, pickle.

1038
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,620
Passing off my flathead is your produce, is it?

1039
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,280
Jasper, why in earth would I do that?

1040
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:24,680
I can't turn my back for a minute in this town without one of you's pinching my tools.

1041
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,020
I swear down, I've never seen this before in my life.

1042
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,880
The axes are not the axes, but the voices are so funny.

1043
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,580
The head office, that's for sure.

1044
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,740
I've never seen it before in my life.

1045
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,520
You're welcome.

1046
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,740
Did I complete it?

1047
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,640
Don't put your bin in my bin.

1048
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,600
I'll help.

1049
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,380
I will help.

1050
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,160
I'm in the bath.

1051
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,060
Oh, knock it on my door, is it?

1052
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,440
It should be fixed now, right?

1053
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,320
Hello!

1054
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,080
Okay, he's doing it.

1055
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,100
Thanks for helping me get the screwdriver back, laddy.

1056
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:15,540
You're so welcome!

1057
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,980
I wish I could say we were done, lad.

1058
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:17,680
I really do.

1059
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,480
But as I got back, I noticed my hammer's gone walkies.

1060
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,480
It must have been pinched by that no-good job, Frank.

1061
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,380
He's probably doing it the brook.

1062
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,220
Poaching fish as we speak.

1063
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:28,820
Okay.

1064
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,240
Where?

1065
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,720
Frank?

1066
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:32,880
Frank?

1067
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:33,960
Frank?

1068
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:36,220
Why is everybody stealing from you?

1069
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:40,960
Let's see.

1070
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,820
Where do I go from here?

1071
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,980
Oh, me and you're Ben.

1072
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,500
Wait, that's so silly.

1073
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,480
Oh, hello.

1074
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,600
Quick in Ed, black in lung.

1075
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,560
Smoking's best when you start it, young.

1076
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,760
I used to go to dishes, but my doctor says that Brian will give me gout.

1077
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,440
Not gout.

1078
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,200
Okay.

1079
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,640
So we're going to Frank's.

1080
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,120
I think it was.

1081
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,200
This is where I...

1082
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,740
Okay, okay.

1083
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,300
Oh, I had to go up here.

1084
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,300
Oh, okay.

1085
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,940
So I actually did the right thing.

1086
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,560
I thought...

1087
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:31,820
Okay.

1088
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:34,000
Oh.

1089
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:34,480
Oh.

1090
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,260
I thought I like went all out of order.

1091
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,520
Excuse me.

1092
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,460
Here he is again.

1093
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,940
Ready for another bit of fiddle sticks, are you?

1094
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,120
Yes, ma'am.

1095
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,800
Awesome, awesome.

1096
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,080
Oh, no.

1097
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,000
Oh, no.

1098
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,780
Ah, hello again.

1099
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,320
Didn't expect to see you twice in one day.

1100
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,320
Sorry, I'm very busy with my inspections.

1101
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,700
I'm very, very...

1102
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,360
He looks so mad.

1103
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,880
I'm sorry!

1104
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,780
Gone to rogues.

1105
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,260
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1106
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,460
I'm a chartered surveyor, and I'm in trouble.

1107
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,660
Hold him still, turpentine.

1108
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,020
My father's the counter.

1109
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:26,940
Oops.

1110
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,140
I didn't mean...

1111
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:28,340
Wait!

1112
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,660
I didn't mean to bully him!

1113
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,180
I'm trying to punish the kid!

1114
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:35,980
Oh, hey.

1115
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,120
I think I killed him, you guys.

1116
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,200
She won't even acknowledge me.

1117
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,500
What's going on here?

1118
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,440
What's actually happening here?

1119
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,640
Going here.

1120
01:09:58,620 --> 01:09:59,420
I love corn.

1121
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,880
I eat all of it.

1122
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:05,980
Hmm.

1123
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,080
No snail zone.

1124
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,560
Are there any snails?

1125
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,140
None.

1126
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:14,780
Corn here.

1127
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,100
They say pills here usually.

1128
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,280
And I say, gosh, hate that.

1129
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,820
But corn here, that's a movement I can get behind.

1130
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,400
I gotta go to Frankie's.

1131
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,100
Is that what it was?

1132
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,060
You think that little worm is okay?

1133
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,350
Rogues.

1134
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,630
Whoa.

1135
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:51,150
I'm a worm!

1136
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:51,950
He's fine!

1137
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:53,770
Okay.

1138
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,990
It's either down the compost heap or off crawling through keyholes at night to find a shiny penny.

1139
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,670
How's that for dirty work?

1140
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:04,810
High five!

1141
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,210
He's alive and he's well!

1142
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,870
Who is up in there?

1143
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,630
Freaky.

1144
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,270
Okay.

1145
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:58,030

Do I go in here?

1148
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,540
Well, well.

1149
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:44,280
I never thought I'd see the day where the big man will come to me for his meat.

1150
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,480
Why are you slapping it like that?

1151
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,460
Here, I'll slap it too.

1152
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:48,820
Oh.

1153
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,230
What just happened?

1154
01:12:59,130 --> 01:12:59,670
Oh.

1155
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:01,330
Ew.

1156
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,510
What's going on?

1157
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:05,650
I don't think I like this one.

1158
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:06,850
Ew.

1159
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,270
Oh!

1160
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,490
Peter Griffin.

1161
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,370
I got you.

1162
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:20,770
I don't think I like this bit.

1163
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:30,970
One dark winter's night, my father brought me and my sisters a lamb each and but a single sheep knife between us.

1164
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:31,730
Mine.

1165
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,930
They run through the litter, jolted as I made the cut.

1166
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,170
It bleated and bled for a fortnight, and I wept.

1167
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,450
Did he just say fortnight?

1168
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:56,700
Oh.

1169
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:03,460
When I was scarcely three years old, me father, mistaking me for a small cut of medicine, blew me out in smokehouse.

1170
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,520
It was nearly a day dangling all the embers before my sisters found me.

1171
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,980
By then, I was already stricken with a black lung.

1172
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,380
The doctor said I shan't likely see my father.

1173
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,300
It means 14 days.

1174
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:13,840
No.

1175
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:14,300
I wept.

1176
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:26,300
Oh.

1177
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:27,600
Oh.

1178
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:28,700
Oh.

1179
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:29,060
Dugtrio.

1180
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,560
Dug.

1181
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:31,600
Dugtro.

1182
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,320
Dugtro.

1183
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:32,620
Dugtro.

1184
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:47,880
I don't like this one, I think.

1185
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,700
Oh, my God.

1186
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,590
What are we playing?

1187
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,230
I'm not quite sure anymore.

1188
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,330
Do you know how glue is made?

1189
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,330
I knew.

1190
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:09,330
I found out when I was only seven years old.

1191
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:10,990
After me, one went lame.

1192
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:12,350
Mother took a titnaca.

1193
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:13,030
Oh, lame.

1194
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:14,970
And I wept.

1195
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:26,700
Um, yeah, when, when horse girls don't, don't produce results.

1196
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,300
And I wept.

1197
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,480
Find all of Sam's meat bits.

1198
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:53,430
Oh, excellent word, lad.

1199
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,070
A fine cut indeed.

1200
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:56,610
I don't think I have words.

1201
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:07,270
I don't think I Now I suppose all we need to do is What?

1202
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,890
I've forgotten The most important ingredient What?

1203
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:31,030

01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:32,690
The number is...

1206
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:40,930
One, two, another two, six.

1207
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:43,470
Hello.

1208
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:48,090
Colin, is that you?

1209
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,090
Oh, hello, Mr. Ron.

01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:51,990

1214
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,390
So you've forgotten my pie mix then.

1215
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:57,890
Uh-oh.

1216
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,850
I'm ever since sorry, Mr. Ron.

1217
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,590
My memory's not been so good since my man...

1218
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:06,410
The business!

1219
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,750

Oh, he's running.

1222
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:13,110
I hear him.

1223
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:13,670
Oh, my God!

1224
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:14,470
Oh, there you are, Colin.

1225
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,490
Here you go, Mr. Ron.

1226
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,530
I came as fast as I could.

1227
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,450
Ooh, blaring.

1228
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:21,270
What the chore?

1229
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,470
Ooh, hello, Colin.

1230
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,810
I had no idea you were in the pie industry.

1231
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:28,830

1232
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:30,310

I don't know.

1236
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:05,350
Go to the hygiene.

1237
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,890
Together sometimes.

1238
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:09,070
Am I doing it?

1239
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:09,710
Am I baking?

1240
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:10,170
Oh, yes.

You made me show on?

1243
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,530
Yes, Flores.

1244
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:16,150
I'm

1245
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,260
doing it.

1246
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:20,840
I'm cooking?

1247
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,580
It doesn't matter now, Flores.

1248
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:25,460
What?

1249
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,020
Oh.

1250
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,340
Enough for everyone.

1251
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,320
What just happened?

1252
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,200
I think I cooked the pot.

1253
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:30,560
Ah!

1254
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:36,740
Mmm.

1255
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,200
What's happening?

1256
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,300
Let me out.

1257
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,520
Get your Zendown to big roads where we've made our biggest pie yet.

1258
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,020
Ah, Guinness World Record!

1259
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,100
How big is the pie?

1260
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,300
Oh my god, like so big.

1261
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,100
Yeah, that's what I said!

1262
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,720
It's a pie so big!

1263
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,200
Uh oh.

1264
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,740
Drama!

1265
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,200
I am close to it since I was a small boy.

1266
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,120
A pie so big that I've eaten.

1267
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:20,540
Now, look, I know you've told me before, but why can't you just, well, you know, make your pies a bit...

1268
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:21,560
Bigger?

1269
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:22,320
Bigger.

1270
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,030
I think he's gonna murder him.

1271
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:31,370
I think he's gonna kill this guy.

1272
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:35,810
I think he's gonna murder him.

1273
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:38,350
And I wept.

1274
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:40,710
What else?

1275
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:42,990
Oh gosh, what do we have now?

1276
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,110
Oh, hello.

1277
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,410
I've been tipped off that someone's selling counterfeit goods.

1278
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:51,570
Counterfeit!

1279
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:52,970
It's all for sale.

1280
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,070
It could...

1281
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:55,070
Karen would have wanted.

1282
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,370
It couldn't be...

1283
01:19:57,410 --> 01:20:00,150
The Yu-Gi- Oh my gosh, wait, all the cards are almost gone.

1284
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,070
We gotta get our pack, you guys.

1285
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:05,950
We gotta get our Yu-Gi-Gi-Oh cards.

1286
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:08,010
What's in here?

1287
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,400
Curious.

1288
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,360
Wait, how do I get up here?

1289
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,740
Am I too small?

1290
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,620
Wait, how do I get up here?

1291
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,400
Oh, not yet.

1292
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:30,760
Okay.

1293
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,200
I'm too short.

1294
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,460
What else we got around here?

1295
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,040
Grandma's still with her.

1296
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:40,840
Uh, you okay?

1297
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,020
Who's gonna have a right job on getting fertilizer with Roger this state?

1298
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:44,820
Oh, that's right!

1299
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,620
The fertilizer!

1300
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,900
What's going on in there?

1301
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,660
He kicked me out earlier.

1302
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,640
I don't think he likes me.

1303
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,380
It's trench warfare!

1304
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,820
Oh my god!

1305
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,220
Don't ask yourself.

1306
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,080
You make it a mess of the place.

1307
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,080
Get out!

1308
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,320
What the devil's gone into your mouth?

1309
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,000
I never even mentioned your massive head.

1310
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:10,440
What?

1311
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,600
It isn't massive.

1312
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,520
Where am I?

1313
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:12,880
Oh.

1314
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,800
Roger, there's no shame in it.

1315
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:19,840
Where am I?

1316
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,600
I'm in the tomatoes.

1317
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,020
Let's get the hell out of here.

1318
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,240
When he was a weird lad.

1319
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:32,420
Ow!

1320
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,690
The noggin!

1321
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,950
I'm sorry, Mr. Peelings.

1322
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,470
We did everything we could.

1323
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:43,150
Oh!

1324
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:46,350
Oh!

1325
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:46,350
Oh!

1326
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:49,750
Roger's got a big head and he's in my head.

1327
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:55,090
Who you calling Pinhead?

1328
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:57,570
Oh my gosh.

1329
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:59,830
They're so mean to him.

1330
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:01,030
Oh no.

1331
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,630
Oh no.

1332
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:04,310
Oh no.

1333
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:05,830
Oh.

1334
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:07,810
Oh.

1335
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:08,950
He's too big.

1336
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,130
Sorry mister.

1337
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,350
It's company policy.

1338
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,900
Never mind them.

1339
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,340
Never mind them, love.

1340
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,360
Never mind them, love.

1341
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,100
I lied to you.

1342
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:27,180
Oh, get yourself a girl who accepts your big head.

1343
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:28,660
Oh, no!

1344
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,920
It's just too big.

1345
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,020
Ooh.

1346
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,940
Oh, Mike, it's just too big.

1347
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:37,660
Too big.

1348
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:38,560
That whole fate?

1349
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,020
No.

1350
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,120
Extra and extra, lad.

1351
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:40,780
Too big.

1352
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:42,980
Too big.

1353
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:43,940
Too big.

1354
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,060
He's heard it his whole life!

1355
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,040
Right then, Rog.

1356
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,880
I'll see you next week.

1357
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,660
My man has trauma!

1358
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,680
Well, Roger.

1359
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,280
Good luck with that, then.

1360
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:13,790
I'm just gonna shimmy on out of here.

1361
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,820
Here we go.

1362
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,120
I'm taking a leap.

1363
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,360
I'm glad that's over.

1364
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,280
I can't stand the fuss.

1365
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:26,980
What?

1366
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:28,800
Can't stand the fuss.

1367
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,040
Um...

1368
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,180
Can we go through here?

1369
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:34,960
Yes, we can.

1370
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,060
Does this go?

1371
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,040
Oh, what's going on here?

1372
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,340
Oh no, we can't go back that way!

1373
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:42,720
Okay.

1374
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:49,390
This is a family where Estrada always gets me.

1375
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,190
It's so funny.

1376
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:56,450
Oh, what do you got there?

1377
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,230
Oh, meweeny sausage meal.

1378
01:23:58,850 --> 01:23:59,790
Blooming hack.

1379
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:02,630
Blooming hack.

1380
01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:04,510
It's the meat in the bun of the burger that I enjoy.

1381
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:05,890
Wait, what's this?

1382
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,650
Any sign of knockoffs?

1383
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:08,810
No, sir.

1384
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:11,490
Blooming hack.

1385
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:12,490
What's this?

1386
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:14,530
Oh, I've never liked to look a clock in the face.

1387
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,950
These watches are painted on.

1388
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:29,710
How would you buy it?

1389
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:30,830
Shame for really.

1390
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,730
Um, hello, Crimester.

1391
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:37,510
No!

1392
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:40,290
It's him.

1393
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:40,530
Ah!

1394
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,710
Bring me beans in.

1395
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,470
Hear my breath.

1396
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:44,730
Bring me beans or bring me death.

1397
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,830
Okay, well, he fixed our problem.

1398
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:50,950
We can hop up now.

1399
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:53,710
Nice.

1400
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:56,530
Where are we going anyway?

1401
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,910
We're platforming?

1402
01:24:59,270 --> 01:24:59,830
Let's get him...

1403
01:24:59,830 --> 01:24:59,970
Oh.

1404
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,330
Hello, sir.

1405
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:03,150
Excuse me, young man.

1406
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:04,630
Get off my soul's glow.

1407
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:05,410
Sorry.

1408
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,270
My old-fashioned nightcap.

1409
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:10,210
My old-fashioned nightcap.

1410
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:13,830
You didn't want those, did you?

1411
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:17,730
Yeah.

1412
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:20,310
There's a little man on my windowsill.

1413
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:22,870
But can you not see me?

1414
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,050
Am I too small?

1415
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,170
Sir?

1416
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,040
Sir?

1417
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,020
Sir, there's a little man on my windowsill.

1418
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,880
You're ready to send, sir.

1419
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,000
Sir?

1420
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,800
Wait, there's a sensor needed in this game?

1421
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,960
It's fine.

1422
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,220
I'm scared.

1423
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:53,760
No, unless you're four.

1424
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,040
Chat's being paranoid.

1425
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:07,650
There's a tiny bit of dong.

1426
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:10,550
It's a cartoon!

1427
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,450
It's okay probably.

1428
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:17,710
Right?

1429
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:44,790

1430
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,960
Okay, there's something to that.

1431
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,840
Okay, I won't look it down.

1432
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:04,780
Wait.

1433
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,220
Convenient sensor right there.

1434
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:09,240
I just won't move.

1435
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,120
Okay, sorry.

1436
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,320
If I have to see it, you do too.

1437
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,140
I'm Wiggity Beanton.

1438
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,200
Hey, my plea.

1439
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,360
I summon my six girls back to me.

1440
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,240
That didn't work.

1441
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,120
Go find them.

1442
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:24,980
What am I finding?

1443
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,040
Your pants?

1444
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:27,500
Or...

1445
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:30,700
Yeah!

1446
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:37,430
What is he, what is, what is...

1447
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:40,410
Where, why are we like in a cloud?

1448
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:47,490
Sue, Ann, Barb, Lou, Sharon, Liz, what are those?

1449
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,190
Those kiss marks?

1450
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:54,810
Wait, oh they're seagulls.

1451
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:55,610
Oh!

1452
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:02,140
There he goes.

1453
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:07,220
Is there another one up here?

1454
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,600
Oh wait, my bad.

1455
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,160
Don't...

1456
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:19,520
Hello?

1457
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:27,020
It's my bedtime!

1458
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,360
Alright, let's go find some seagulls!

1459
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:33,960
Oh.

1460
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:38,540
Dear, oh dear young lad, looks like we just missed him by a train.

1461
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,640
I saw him though.

1462
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,340
I saw him.

1463
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,440
I caught that guy red-handed.

1464
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,140
Oh, seagull, seagull!

1465
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:54,290
I'm trying to get the seagull, don't mind me.

1466
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,330
There we go.

1467
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,580
Oh, nope, those are pigeons.

1468
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:06,560
None of them, none of them.

1469
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,100
Let's see.

1470
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,640
How long before that pie spoils, you think?

1471
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,220
Seagulls, oh seagulls!

1472
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,500
How many are there?

1473
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,220
Oh, here's another one.

1474
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:27,960
A few days?

1475
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:28,280
Never.

1476
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,120
Six.

1477
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:41,300
Oh!

1478
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:41,660
Oh!

1479
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:42,940
Oh!

1480
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:45,660
That's so awkward.

1481
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:46,820
Sorry.

1482
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:51,730
what was that five i think

1483
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:58,330
six about six perhaps

1484
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:25,060
seven i like when things become so cringe that people it's not funny but people like just still do it because it's like stupid That's how I feel 6-7 is becoming.

1485
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:30,330
What did I miss?

1486
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:38,820
It's for the bit.

1487
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:39,700
Yeah, yeah.

1488
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,700
Like, it's not actually funny.

1489
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,180
It's just silly to say it.

1490
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,800
Like the Tumblr-e.

1491
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:52,780
We all could use a little more whimsy in our lives and after lives, you know?

1492
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,800
So, you don't have to think it's funny, but...

1493
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,440
It's just silly.

1494
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,940
You know, let people be their silly...

1495
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:01,680
Oh, there it is.

1496
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,780
Silly, silly selves.

1497
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,300

1498
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,620
Sam Hearts Rumps.

1499
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,760
Yeah, he does.

1500
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:19,480
Oh, not again.

1501
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,380
No, not again.

1502
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,400
It's so worth it.

1503
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,420
The people will never eat there again.

1504
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,520

1511
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,820
What did I need to do?

1512
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:33,940

Oh, that's right, that's right.

1516
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:45,760
I like the music.

1517
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,680
Weeweeweeweewee.

1518
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:52,300
Wait, check the bricks.

1519
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,280
And the river.

1520
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:57,440
What was the river?

1521
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:02,280
I remember the guy with the little weed at the river.

1522
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,500
Shadow detective, thank you so much for that super job.

1523
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,600
Thank you.

1524
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,720
Nobody is getting bricks anymore?

1525
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:09,760
Oh, wait.

1526
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,920
Big secondhand furniture never used.

1527
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,060
Chairs, lamps, doors, and mores.

1528
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:23,500
I got the achievement help Nick open up a new store.

1529
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:24,720
Hello.

1530
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,670
Oh my god.

1531
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,740
Okay, let's try going back to the garden then.

1532
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:42,920
It was fine in the 70s, and it's fine now.

1533
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,060
You are all soft.

1534
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,540
I'm just a big old softy.

1535
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,740
They're here.

1536
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,640
We're back in the pipes.

1537
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,060
I can't get enough of these...

1538
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,240
Dang pipes.

1539
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:00,220
Oh my gosh.

1540
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,440
Is the plate getting further and further to the right?

1541
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:07,960
Oh my gosh.

1542
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:08,640
No.

1543
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,980
I'm going to break her.

1544
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:17,640
Hurry down along to the brook before Frank does himself a mischief with my hammer.

1545
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:18,160
Okay.

1546
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:21,580
No.

1547
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,040
I don't want to break it.

1548
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:24,860
Oh, look at this now.

1549
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,020
My brother's in the bin.

1550
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:32,310
What a stupid bit.

1551
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:33,330
I love it.

1552
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:38,530
I like how every time I come by in these places, something has changed just a little bit.

1553
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:39,730
Oh my gosh, your toast is burnt.

1554
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:41,170
Oh.

1555
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:41,970
Oh.

1556
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:43,170
Yeah, yeah.

1557
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,410
Just letting you know.

1558
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,190
Greatest love story ever told.

1559
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:50,850
They're cute.

1560
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:51,610
They're cute.

1561
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,990
Hello.

1562
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:57,870
Wait.

1563
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:01,810
Franks.

1564
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:03,390
Is that the guy who...

1565
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:11,990
Hi.

1566
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:13,350
Oh, hi.

1567
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:16,090
I've got some more sausages, and I'm going to poke them through the hole.

1568
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:17,270
Okay, I'm ready to catch.

1569
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:17,850
Oh.

1570
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:19,610
That's all right.

1571
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:20,170
This one?

1572
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:20,690
Oh.

1573
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:22,850
One more?

1574
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:24,490
Yeah, I've dropped that one too.

1575
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:27,010
I'm afraid I've run out of sausages now.

1576
01:36:27,790 --> 01:36:29,410
I'll go to the shop and buy some more.

1577
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:36,460
It's...

1578
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,660
He's so mysterious.

1579
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,640
He's so mysterious.

1580
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:41,580
It's so elusive, it's attractive, you know?

1581
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:44,440
Hello, I'm back.

1582
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,240
Okay, okay, Gaffna.

1583
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,680
Keep your rhubarb folded on the way down.

1584
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,160
My way?

1585
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:59,800
Oh no, no, no, no.

1586
01:37:02,730 --> 01:37:03,410
Yo!

1587
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:08,810
You, you little, little dusty gentleman, you.

1588
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,130

1589

I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1590
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:14,410
I'm so sorry.

1591
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,720
Okay.

1592
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,160
What's going on?

1593
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:29,640
Why are you...

1594
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,300
Steady as you go.

1595
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:57,090
What's going on?

1596
01:37:58,030 --> 01:37:58,730
The picture?

1597
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:01,970
What about it?

1598
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:03,250

Good grief.

1610
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,810
This town is going to the night.

1611
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,950
You better keep an eye out, lad.

1612

Okay, let's keep going.

1619
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:46,140
It was just a dramatic pause.

1620
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,120
Okay.

1621
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:51,340
Let's keep going.

1622
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:54,100
But not before.

1623
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,400
Oh, I wanted to break those.

1624
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,200
Hmm.

1625
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,760
Corn on the cob.

1626
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,260
Corn off the cob.

1627
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,760
Yay!

1628
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:10,600
Can I go in?

1629
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:11,420
Wait, is this?

1630
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,340
I don't want to go in there, actually.

1631
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,160
I lied.

1632
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,060
Any snails?

1633
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:19,420
None.

1634
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:21,540
No snails?

1635
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:24,960
No snails.

1636
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:26,260
Oh.

1637
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:28,520
No gardening for you either.

1638
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,300
The music is so cute, though.

1639
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,360
Oh, I didn't even step on him!

1640
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,400
Oh, the fire department.

1641
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:41,800
Tell them, old Charlie's got himself stuck in the well again.

1642
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,180
They'll know what it means.

1643
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:44,740
Shut up and have his spoon.

1644
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,220
Thank goodness Minciers!

1645
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:49,000
Strike Warlock!

1646
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,160
Thank you so much for the peek!

1647
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,460
Oh, I think he wants to be kissed by that lady.

1648
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:56,800
Oh, my gosh.

1649
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,140
Mr. Man.

1650
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:01,800
Wanted for crime.

1651
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:07,200
What was out here again?

1652
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,080
Are you here to give the hand with fishing?

1653
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:10,640
Yeah?

1654
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:12,240

1657
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,810
Where's the bait?

1658
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:18,890
Do not bash.

1659
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:19,230
Okay.

1660
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:21,830
We're fine.

1661
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:23,870
Bait box.

1662
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:24,830
Where?

1663
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:26,170
Oh!

1664
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:27,290
Okay.

1665
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:28,270

Okay.

Ah, good idea.

1668
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:30,450
You can go in and all.

1669
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:31,290
Okay.

1670
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:31,630
Oh.

1671
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:32,750
Okay.

1672
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:37,410

The hammer.

1675
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:51,790
How do I grab it?

1676
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:53,230
Take it.

1677
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:53,970
Take it home.

1678
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:56,950

Oh, catch of the day!

02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:01,720

1913
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:25,920

1915
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,450

1916
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:37,150
It's just ectoplasm?

1917
02:01:37,610 --> 02:01:39,750
Wait, do you got any more sausages for me?

1918
02:01:40,270 --> 02:01:40,470

1919
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:48,010

Oh, wait, no.

1924
02:01:56,290 --> 02:01:57,130
The old guy!

1925
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:01,290
The only normal...

1926
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:03,290
person in this...

1927
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:04,550
town.

1928
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,810
Where do we even begin?

1929
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:17,800
He's shaking.

1930
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,960
He's shaking and...

1931
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:22,260
He'll never live normally again.

1932
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,080
He's so anxious.

1933
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:26,280
This poor guy.

1934
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:36,070
Crime!

1935
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:37,390
Still at large!

1936
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:39,850
No, no, God, no.

1937
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:40,710
Oh, don't do this.

1938
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:42,690
We can avoid this.

1939
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:50,170
No, I'm so sorry.

1940
02:02:50,890 --> 02:02:51,230
Please.

1941
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:53,130
Expect it.

1942
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:55,530
Accept my smack of shame.

1943
02:02:57,190 --> 02:02:58,470
I'm so sorry.

1944
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:01,650
I'm so sorry.

1945
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:03,990
Can I take your ten, Bob?

1946
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:04,490
No?

1947
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:05,050
All right.

1948
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:07,350
Sorry for the trouble.

1949
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:08,490
What are you wearing?

1950
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:11,510
Green dungarees in a flat cap.

1951
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:13,370
You're not going to believe this.

1952
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:14,190
Oh?

1953
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,450
Heavens have beat me.

1954
02:03:15,690 --> 02:03:17,350
I need to get that fixed.

1955
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:20,350
What just happened?

1956
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:23,450
How did we end up here?

1957
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:27,230
Hmm.

1958
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,750
Oh!

1959
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,900
What do you guys think?

1960
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:38,480
Is he dead?

1961
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:41,620
They decapitated him!

1962
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:44,080
I don't think it...

1963
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:44,200
Oh!

1964
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:46,820
Oh my god!

1965
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:48,200
Is he okay?

1966
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:50,560
He's twitching.

1967
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:51,340
He's still alive.

1968
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:52,180
It worked!

1969
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:53,780
It worked?

1970
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:54,560
You think so?

1971
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:57,460
He doesn't even get to...

1972
02:03:58,120 --> 02:03:59,300
Well, I don't know.

1973
02:03:59,740 --> 02:03:59,840
Oh.

1974
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:01,400
Oof.

1975
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:10,010
As an American who went to Vexpo, I can confirm it was exactly like this.

1976
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:11,430
How many things?

1977
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:12,730
How many people did you punch?

1978
02:04:15,190 --> 02:04:15,910
How many?

1979
02:04:16,050 --> 02:04:16,390
How many?

1980
02:04:18,670 --> 02:04:21,510
Or can you only do that if you live there?

1981
02:04:23,610 --> 02:04:25,610
This is a barbie area.

1982
02:04:28,950 --> 02:04:29,330
Slap.

1983
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:30,310
Sorry, my bad.

1984
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:30,810
You're right.

1985
02:04:31,070 --> 02:04:31,230
You're right.

1986
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:32,650
How many people did you slap?

1987
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,200
You okay?

1988
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:45,740
Oh, God.

1989
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:48,260
I don't think he's ever getting out.

1990
02:04:53,230 --> 02:04:54,510
I can't believe it worked.

1991
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:57,810
I don't need...

1992
02:04:59,230 --> 02:05:00,990
Oh my god, it was him!

1993
02:05:01,130 --> 02:05:04,050
His meals for worms, an extra bag of soil.

1994
02:05:05,590 --> 02:05:07,430
He's doing crimes!

1995
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:11,690
He's still doing crimes.

1996
02:05:12,190 --> 02:05:13,130
I said, in areas?

1997
02:05:14,050 --> 02:05:15,610
Well, I could try, but it's your wife.

1998
02:05:16,210 --> 02:05:16,710
Weigh, weigh.

1999
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,870
Oh, la la, what's going on there?

2000
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:24,770
I can't believe he's doing all these crimes.

2001
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:27,170
I can't believe it.

2002
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:30,130
Is this open up now?

2003
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:31,470
No?

2004
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:34,250
I'm smushing.

2005
02:05:36,350 --> 02:05:36,950
I'm smushing.

2006
02:05:39,490 --> 02:05:41,110
Lock him up.

2007
02:05:41,770 --> 02:05:43,370
Take away the key.

2008
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:47,450
Do you think it was normal milk or?

2009
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:49,050
Aww.

2010
02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:51,190
That's right!

2011
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:53,410
Wait, why did we have to go here again for?

2012
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:54,930
I can't remember actually.

2013
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:58,570
This game is making me bomb

2014
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:08,430
Okay, I think he wants us to go to the...

2015
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:10,030
Oh, oh my god!

2016
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:11,530
Meep!

2017
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,160
Did the poison...

2018
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,680
The rat poison that were.

2019
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:28,250
Alright, I'll tell him.

2020
02:06:28,430 --> 02:06:28,790
Wait, oh.

2021
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:34,250
He's here now.

2022
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:35,590
Wait, there's gossiping about me!

2023
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:37,550
Spirit level bubbles, is it?

2024
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:38,070
Yes.

2025
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:39,630
Zoran, look.

2026
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:43,510
We just got a fresh batch in this morning.

2027
02:06:44,070 --> 02:06:44,750
They're in the batch.

2028
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:45,330
Yeah, look.

2029
02:06:46,930 --> 02:06:47,490
Okay!

2030
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:48,770
You need this!

2031
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:51,430
Good luck!

2032
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:53,370
Come on!

2033
02:06:54,490 --> 02:06:54,770
Ah!

2034
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:55,970
Ah!

2035
02:06:56,650 --> 02:06:56,850
Ah!

2036
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:56,950
Ah!

2037
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:05,350
Ah!

2038
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:05,950
Ah!

2039
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:06,310
Oh!

2040
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:13,630
They're real?

2041
02:07:15,530 --> 02:07:17,330
Oh, it was supposed to be a prank.

2042
02:07:18,350 --> 02:07:18,570
Ah!

2043
02:07:20,370 --> 02:07:21,250
Silly.

2044
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:23,630
Can't prank me!

2045
02:07:24,730 --> 02:07:25,890
I'm going.

2046
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:29,150
I'm through the roof.

2047
02:07:32,390 --> 02:07:32,670
Oh.

2048
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:35,190
Hello?

2049
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:40,980
Hello?

2050
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:42,880
What's going on?

2051
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:45,000
I don't know anything that's happening anymore!

2052
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,160
Why is he so tiny?

2053
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:49,680
You can't just ask a person about their size.

2054
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,180
I'm going up.

2055
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:57,180
We're going- all things are coming up, Mickey!

2056
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,600
Oh my gosh.

2057
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:02,780
The view, finally a good view of this town.

2058
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:08,260
Yeah, what's going on?

2059
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,220
Such lovely lashes.

2060
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:18,160
It's just a little guy, oh gosh, the sparkle in his eye!

2061
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:22,140
He's never seen anything so beautiful!

2062
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:23,680
Oh my gosh.

2063
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,620
The sun is so...

2064
02:08:33,620 --> 02:08:34,640
Massive.

2065
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,580
Why is Minto so tiny?

2066
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:43,600
So I says to them, I says, yeah, it's an ovencloth.

2067
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:44,000
Ooh.

2068
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:46,260
Where else am I supposed to put it?

2069
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:48,020
In the oven.

2070
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:49,100
Oh, cry.

2071
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:50,600
Oh.

2072
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,000
Watches?

2073
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:54,180
Is that real felt?

2074
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,100
Coat for sale.

2075
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:57,520
How much?

2076
02:08:59,120 --> 02:08:59,760
Can Bob?

2077
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:00,660
Very reasonable.

2078
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,680
I just got four fingers.

2079
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:04,340
I still got that cabbage money.

2080
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,200
We got!

2081
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:12,540
Look everyone, this young man's caught bootleg Bill.

2082
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:14,700
It's more of a cumbering grass, really.

2083
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:18,760
Oh my gosh, I'm the talk of the town.

2084
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:20,680
I'm the town's little hero.

2085
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:21,240
Yay!

2086
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:26,080
Hooray!

2087
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:26,500
Oh.

2088
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:28,920
Hip, hip.

2089
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:29,820
Three cheers.

2090
02:09:29,900 --> 02:09:30,660
Three cheers.

2091
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:31,760
Ah!

2092
02:09:32,420 --> 02:09:35,580
Now, now, settle down, settle down.

2093
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:41,640
Thanks to this young man's incredible police work, I can safely declare.

2094
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:41,980
Hip, hip.

2095
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:46,300
in this town has been knocked on the head.

2096
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:47,560
Yeah!

2097
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:49,340
Still at large.

2098
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:54,260
Capture a notorious criminal.

2099
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:56,500
I did do that.

2100
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:58,880
Are you okay?

2101
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:00,820
Kiss the cook.

2102
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,670
What do I do now?

2103
02:10:06,210 --> 02:10:07,890
Almost out with this one, Charlie.

2104
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:09,730
Terrific job, Susan.

2105
02:10:10,190 --> 02:10:11,550
You learned that shilling yet.

2106
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:14,150
Minto shouldn't be exhausting her.

2107
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:16,710
last brain cell and such intense ADHD frolic.

2108
02:10:17,130 --> 02:10:18,690
What is going on?

2109
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:23,110
Oh, we're still shopping with the hand, right?

2110
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:24,950
Okay, we're in here.

2111
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:33,710
Um, the rats are still at large.

2112
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:38,170
Uh, um.

2113
02:10:40,570 --> 02:10:41,190
Where are you?

2114
02:10:42,070 --> 02:10:45,610
Oh, no, you're... Is it back here?

2115
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:46,930
Oh, yes, yes!

2116
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:55,880
Steal!

2117
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:58,640
You want some soup?

2118
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:01,140
Ugh, too wet.

2119
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:01,820
Okay.

2120
02:11:03,860 --> 02:11:05,180
You want some peens?

2121
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:07,400
It's peens?

2122
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:08,640
No.

2123
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:10,780
Um...

2124
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,780
You want some...

2125
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:15,140
Triple with... bit?

2126
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:15,580
Wait.

2127
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,180
Wait.

2128
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:25,180
Ugh.

2129
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:26,860
Oh, here we go.

2130
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:28,780
You want some tinned pie?

2131
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:30,520
Tiny Tom's?

2132
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:31,120
Too dry.

2133
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:31,960
Too dry.

2134
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:32,260
Okay.

2135
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:34,620
You want some lovely boy soup?

2136
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:36,200
Too red.

2137
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:38,500
You want some big boys tin dinner?

2138
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:43,300
You want some wet m- No, this is too wet.

2139
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:44,180
This is too wet.

2140
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:48,300
You want some soup to push?

2141
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:49,380
Okay.

2142
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:50,840
Well, two meta.

2143
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:52,700
Two meta.

2144
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,380
You want some lard?

2145
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:59,240
You want some peens?

2146
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:04,880
You want some soup for her?

2147
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:08,120
You want some butter?

2148
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:10,780
You want some breakfast blend?

2149
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:15,460
Oh, what's this?

2150
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,580
Gummy's breakfast blend.

2151
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:19,380
And only...

2152
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:20,900
40 years out of date.

2153
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:22,580
We'll take the lot.

2154
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,320
The watch.

2155
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:31,740
Where did the hand come from?

2156
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:35,380
Can be his breakfast blend.

2157
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,320
Kind of getting hungry.

2158
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,420
Oh, good.

2159
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:40,540
I'm going to dinner soon.

2160
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:41,760
This one's immunized.

2161
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:43,660
How much left do I have the game?

2162
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:45,720
Altogether, that's.

2163
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:46,860
That's?

2164
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:47,520
How much?

2165
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:49,080
Ten bob.

2166
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,960
Everything is ten bob.

2167
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:56,920
Pretty close to the end now?

2168
02:12:57,220 --> 02:12:57,520
Okay, cool.

2169
02:12:57,640 --> 02:13:00,060
Thank you, guys.

2170
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:02,960
Oh, my outline is still here.

2171
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:08,200
Cool.

2172
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,580
Where was that guy's...

2173
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:13,140
Was it this way?

2174
02:13:18,050 --> 02:13:19,170
My ectoplasm...

2175
02:13:19,170 --> 02:13:20,210
Oh, come on.

2176
02:13:21,490 --> 02:13:23,150
My ectoplasm outline.

2177
02:13:23,370 --> 02:13:23,910
Yeah, exactly.

2178
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:27,950
It's just ectoplasm, everybody.

2179
02:13:31,190 --> 02:13:33,860
Okay, I think you've had enough of your greed little piglet.

2180
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,860
No, it's okay to be greedy, isn't it?

2181
02:13:42,620 --> 02:13:45,000
Eat, wait, wait, wait.

2182
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:48,060
Oh wait.

2183
02:13:53,570 --> 02:13:55,730
He's just waiting for me!

2184
02:13:57,770 --> 02:14:01,570
Oh, okay, come on, yep, come on through, come on through.

2185
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:03,970
There's a public bridal way, Nish.

2186
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:05,670
I'll get you a key cutter.

2187
02:14:05,970 --> 02:14:07,330
I'll call Bonnie right now, in fact.

2188
02:14:07,490 --> 02:14:08,070
I'm sorry.

2189
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:08,750
I'm sorry.

2190
02:14:09,430 --> 02:14:10,250
I'm sorry.

2191
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:11,450
I'm sorry.

2192
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:13,210
I don't want to be this way.

2193
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:14,330
I don't want to be this tiny.

2194
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:15,670
It's hard for me to.

2195
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:17,650
This poor guy.

2196
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:18,170
I feel so bad.

2197
02:14:18,290 --> 02:14:18,410
No, Barbara.

2198
02:14:18,710 --> 02:14:19,670
No, Barbara.

2199
02:14:20,170 --> 02:14:21,210
Hold the handrail, Barbara.

2200
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:23,750
Mind those banana skins, Barbara.

2201
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:24,470
Watch out.

2202
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:25,010
Barbara.

2203
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:27,930
Sorry, lad.

2204
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:30,190
I was dreaming about my dead wife.

2205
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:35,490
Gosh, TMI, Rob.

2206
02:14:39,010 --> 02:14:39,490
Oh, dear.

2207
02:14:39,790 --> 02:14:42,510
I got you.

2208
02:14:42,590 --> 02:14:43,090
I got you.

2209
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:43,970
I got you.

2210
02:14:45,650 --> 02:14:46,870
I've got you.

2211
02:14:47,290 --> 02:14:48,910
This is a no-snail zone.

2212
02:14:50,510 --> 02:14:52,590
This is a no-snail zone.

2213
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:53,490
Murder, murder.

2214
02:14:53,670 --> 02:14:54,910
Oh, there's another one going down the well.

2215
02:14:55,970 --> 02:14:57,210
I killed that one.

2216
02:14:57,350 --> 02:14:58,210
Or it died, right?

2217
02:14:58,250 --> 02:14:58,550
Oh, dear.

2218
02:15:01,950 --> 02:15:02,810
Oh no.

2219
02:15:03,010 --> 02:15:03,570
Oh no.

2220
02:15:05,710 --> 02:15:07,910
I'm killing them, I'm murdering them!

2221
02:15:10,870 --> 02:15:11,410
No snails!

2222
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:12,570
No snails allowed!

2223
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:14,410
Did you get away from me?

2224
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:15,850
I did.

2225
02:15:16,050 --> 02:15:16,670
You're fine.

2226
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:17,330
Don't worry.

2227
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:20,050
Oh, horrid snail!

2228
02:15:20,290 --> 02:15:21,290
Oh, horrid snail!

2229
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:23,890
Oh wait, I have to go down because they sealed up the exit.

2230
02:15:24,070 --> 02:15:24,190
Okay.

2231
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:26,410
Or she's blocking the exit rather.

2232
02:15:28,530 --> 02:15:31,300
Ha ha!

2233
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:31,840
Oh!

2234
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:33,800
Oh!

2235
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:35,840
Wait, can I, uh...

2236
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,360
Can I get a little ride back up?

2237
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:41,140
She didn't choose to be so tiny and full of violence.

2238
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:41,400
Oh!

2239
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:42,800
It's your whole wife!

2240
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:43,540
You know what?

2241
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:44,220
Never mind.

2242
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:49,900
A bull supper?

2243
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:50,700
Wait!

2244
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:52,680
We were gonna get food together?

2245
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:54,300
Me and our whole wives?

2246
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:57,880
A little off-peast here, but another thing worms really love.

2247
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:59,480
A rooster's egg.

2248
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:03,560
It's not an easy snack, but by God is a protein worthy.

2249
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,120
Huh.

2250
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:10,410
I forgot about this air.

2251
02:16:10,450 --> 02:16:12,910
Oh, they're all fried now.

2252
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:18,190
Oh my gosh, the details are so goofy in this game.

2253
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:26,370
Hello!

2254
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:28,070
Oh,

2255
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:32,770
just kidding.

2256
02:16:34,590 --> 02:16:35,870
Yeah, sophisticated!

2257
02:16:40,430 --> 02:16:41,310
Oh yeah.

2258
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:43,930
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

2259
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:44,490
Okay.

2260
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:46,550
Did you see the eyes?

2261
02:16:46,710 --> 02:16:47,090
I did.

2262
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:50,150
They were all looking at me.

2263
02:16:53,010 --> 02:16:53,810
Get them all.

2264
02:16:53,910 --> 02:16:54,670
Oh wait, I didn't.

2265
02:16:57,970 --> 02:16:59,210
Wait, I missed something.

2266
02:17:00,810 --> 02:17:01,650
Wait, what did I miss?

2267
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:06,290
Missed the payoff, but he said it was fine.

2268
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:08,650
Huh?

2269
02:17:10,650 --> 02:17:11,510
Wait, what, what, what?

2270
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,490
Sorry!

2271
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:17,570
I didn't realize!

2272
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:20,450
Alright, if you must know, cocktail sausage and down the snorkel.

2273
02:17:21,850 --> 02:17:22,070
Huh?

2274
02:17:23,730 --> 02:17:26,330
You ignore him and keep smacking it.

2275
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:30,070
Huh?

2276
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:36,340
Oh my gosh, wait!

2277
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:38,280
It's an actual... animal!

2278
02:17:42,910 --> 02:17:44,390
I forgot about this area.

2279
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:45,430

That's true.

She's off to uni next year.

02:18:59,160 --> 02:18:59,220

02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:03,520
Let's get down Pum and have a yard.

2291
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,580
The boys would love to see you.

2292
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,620
That one wasn't a fish.

2293
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:09,080
It wasn't.

2294
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:14,100
What else could it have been?

2295
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:16,760
Wait.

2296
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:19,800
No, dang it.

2297
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,980
I thought that guy was at the exploding food.

2298
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:23,000
is gonna be there.

2299
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:24,200
Why is everything gone?

2300
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:26,360
Oh no, I've just got off the phone with that Karen.

2301
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:31,180
Turns out, she says don't sell all my clothes unbammed with my get-lap last time.

2302
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:31,660
Oops!

02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:33,480
Well, sorry, Karen.

2304
02:19:37,480 --> 02:19:38,460
Closing hours.

2305
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:41,460
Oh my gosh, wait, we gotta get the last Yu-Gi-Oh!

2306
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:46,140
I'm pushing cardboard boxes in here.

2307
02:19:48,660 --> 02:19:50,020
I'm not sure where to go.

2308
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:53,540
How do I... I can't remember how Oh, he's down here.

2309
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,560
Wait, I don't have to see this guy again, do I?

2310
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,240
Excuse me!

2311
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:01,620
Oh, okay.

2312
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:02,940
He's asleep.

2313
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:05,820
Oh, but he's got a bed for two.

2314
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:07,540
Wait a second.

2315
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:09,200
No, wait.

2316
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:12,340
You're the brick guy.

2317
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:13,120
You're Nick.

2318
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:15,000
Nick with the bricks.

2319
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:16,220
I don't know.

2320
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:16,960
You lived here, too?

2321
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:19,200
Wait, yeah, there they are, right there together.

2322
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:20,520
Wait, that's so cute.

2323
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:22,020
Oh, so sorry.

2324
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:22,180
I'm sorry.

2325
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:23,320
Oh,

2326
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:26,680
thank you.

2327
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:33,140
He's got really bad IBS or something.

2328
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:37,420
The guy can't stop.

2329
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:41,360
The guy can't stop going to the bathroom.

2330
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:44,640
He's got to get that checked out.

2331
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:45,320
Aww.

2332
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:47,500
We're all here.

2333
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:49,080
Thank you.

2334
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,160
Oof, you've got some heat on that.

2335
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,800
I know.

2336
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:00,020
It's nearly as big as mine.

2337
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:05,960
It is fucking massive.

2338
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:06,860
Oh, okay.

2339
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:08,340
Someone's...

2340
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:09,600
You don't just say it outright.

2341
02:21:10,900 --> 02:21:12,500
License to serve minors.

2342
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:13,640
Oh my gosh, no!

2343
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:15,300
Not at the pub.

2344
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:16,580
I don't know what I'll do now.

2345
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:18,480
You'll keep kicking.

2346
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:20,720
You'll kick through life.

2347
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:23,340
Oh.

2348
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:24,860
That's...

2349
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:27,400
Jasper should have left that fire broke.

2350
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:31,980
Bountain broke.

2351
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:33,960
It's broke.

2352
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:35,000
You okay?

2353
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:38,180
Let's go check on this guy.

2354
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,520
Not here.

2355
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:40,820
No, no, no.

2356
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:41,380
They're here.

2357
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:43,780
They're here.

2358
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:47,820
Hello!

2359
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:49,360
I'm home!

2360
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:51,440
How was it?

2361
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:57,780
Oh yeah, the breakfast blend.

2362
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:59,080
Here for you.

2363
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:01,600
Ooh, it's coming.

2364
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:03,260
It's almost there.

2365
02:22:03,980 --> 02:22:05,200
Oh, just another second.

2366
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:06,760
One more push.

2367
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:13,080
Just around the corner for you.

2368
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:15,700
Ooh.

2369
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:17,200
Juicy.

2370
02:22:17,860 --> 02:22:19,440
Breakfast in bed.

2371
02:22:22,740 --> 02:22:25,220
I'm so hungry, though, you guys.

2372
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:34,550
The Baja Blast Pot.

2373
02:22:34,570 --> 02:22:37,450
I kind of want to try it because I've never had Baja Blast before.

2374
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:39,410
I should be able to have the pie, right?

2375
02:22:41,650 --> 02:22:42,670
Dinner soon.

2376
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:43,930
Yeah, I'm so hungry.

2377
02:22:46,410 --> 02:22:49,070
Oh, we're sharing with the whole town.

2378
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:54,400
Oh, your dinner's ready.

2379
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:56,140
Hello?

2380
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:58,700
What if the person upstairs didn't have...

2381
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:01,200
That's me!

2382
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:05,860
What if he didn't have food?

2383
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:10,700
Oh no, it looks as if our cuckoo clock is broken.

2384
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:19,020
Oh dear, oh dear, it's really broke.

2385
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:20,080
Please won't you help us?

2386
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:20,720
Six o'clock.

02:23:23,980 --> 02:23:26,040
Get that clock and bash this mole.

2388
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:27,860
We need to knock him down the hole.

2389
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:32,060
Your garden's fine.

2390
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:34,740

02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:15,880
Before we all sit down to eat, we'll have to bash on every beat.

2397
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:22,660
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, now then lad, my garden's full of dirty moulds you need to call.

Help me please, I'm in distress.

2404
02:24:48,380 --> 02:24:50,160
I just can't see you all this mess.

2405
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,200
Forget that truck.

2406
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:55,080
We need you more.

2407
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:56,980
There's so much soap spilled on the floor.

2408
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:01,120
That's it, young man.

2409
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:01,860
You've mocked enough.

2410
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,680
Now help me chop my tatties up.

2411
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,420
Help me keep the crime at bay.

2412
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:12,440
My dog needs smoking every day.

2413
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,780
Make it quick.

2414
02:25:17,380 --> 02:25:19,200
Open his round and make his sick.

2415
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:22,660
Hurry up and make him sick.

2416
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:26,080
Give that filth in all of a stick.

2417
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,560
Slice the bread and make him thin.

2418
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:32,740
Careful now we are, machine.

2419
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:36,220
Bites it young and bash that bloke.

2420
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:36,680
Bites it young and bash that bloke.

2421
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:39,880
Won't you give my dog a stroll?

2422
02:25:41,480 --> 02:25:43,280
Finney, let's see what I've got.

2423
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:46,680
Push until we both fall off.

2424
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:50,020
You know here what we both said?

2425
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:51,920
Oh my god, how much more!

2426
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,200
Watch that mole until it's dead.

2427
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:54,000
Until it's dead?

2428
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,800
Cut straight through that lovely grass.

2429
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:00,220
I don't feel super, but needs most.

2430
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:01,820
Ow!

2431
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:03,800
Why should we all be biking too?

2432
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:06,680
Steady on this bed.

2433
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:12,020
I'm destroying the town!

2434
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:12,160
I'm destroying the town!

2435
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,920
I think I need a little more.

2436
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,040
Everybody's dying!

2437
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:17,520
Hang on, why is it me and so?

2438
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:20,820

02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,860

02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:34,440

Oh, thank goodness you're here.

2453
02:27:58,720 --> 02:27:59,200
No!

2454
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:01,900
I'm just about to talk into this delicious amsani.

2455
02:28:02,460 --> 02:28:04,180
I have lost the mayoral mustard.

2456
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:07,160
Oh!

2457
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:08,540
Oh!

2458
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,100
Oh, we beat her!

2459
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:15,700
Oh, title drop!

2460
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:24,120
Yay!

2461
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:32,080
Oh my goodness.

2462
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:32,800
Okay, hold on.

2463
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:35,800
I need to eat some chips real quick because I'm actually gonna starve.

2464
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:37,140
Even though I'm about to go to dinner.

2465
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:40,980
Just a chip.

2466
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:42,540
Just a little chip.

2467
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,100
I'm an honorary Brit.

2468
02:28:44,220 --> 02:28:48,300
I don't think I understood literally anything that was going on in there.

2469
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:50,720
Oh, well, thank you so much for the food.

2470
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:53,780
Just a chip.

2471
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:54,700
Just a wee chip.

2472
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:04,190
Crisps.

2473
02:29:04,630 --> 02:29:05,890
Wait, yes, these are crisps.

2474
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:07,330
These are not chips.

2475
02:29:07,890 --> 02:29:08,770
These are crisps.

2476
02:29:08,990 --> 02:29:09,890
We were so right.

2477
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:18,480
That game was crazy.

2478
02:29:21,060 --> 02:29:22,360
That game was insane.

2479
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:25,380
And I, I went insane with it.

2480
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:28,740
I think...

2481
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:29,800
I'm not British enough.

2482
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:33,300
One more crisp for the road.

2483
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:36,100
What a day.

2484
02:29:36,260 --> 02:29:37,020
You earned those.

2485
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:37,640
Thank you.

2486
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,960
You don't even know the day that I've had.

2487
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:45,360
I held a baby for the first time today.

2488
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:49,220
And then I held two.

2489
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:51,940
And then they were like, no, you have to have three.

2490
02:29:57,500 --> 02:29:58,300
It was...

2491
02:29:58,300 --> 02:29:59,460
Yeah, poor baby.

2492
02:30:00,340 --> 02:30:01,140
Poor baby.

2493
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:05,580
Now, for the first time.

2494
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:08,000
It was scary.

2495
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:12,220
I'm tired.

2496
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,620
And now I get my reward.

2497
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:15,940
I get to go out to dinner.

2498
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:19,080
Thank you, everybody, so much for playing.

2499
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:19,820
Thank goodness you're here.

2500
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:22,440
I wish I could talk with you guys more, but I gotta skiddle.

2501
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:23,820
Battle for Phu!

2502
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:26,180
Scared me.

2503
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:30,420
That's my ride, if you can hear him.

2504
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,680
Triko, thank you so much for the pig!

2505
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:35,560
Make me tag you!

2506
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:37,980
Thank goodness you're here!

2507
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:43,340
Panic, that's me.

2508
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:45,400
Otomito!

2509
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:46,740
Otomito!

2510
02:30:49,540 --> 02:30:50,060
Thank you so much.

2511
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:52,260
Well, thank you so much.

2512
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:58,280
For some reason, it's one of those types of games I can't like, if I close out of the game, you know, I can't read everybody's...

2513
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,720
That was so silly.

2514
02:30:59,980 --> 02:31:00,840
It was so silly.

2515
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:02,900
It was like a Mr. Bean episode, huh?

2516
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:06,100
Thank you guys so, so much.

2517
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:09,320
Make sure to Britishly declare Blooming Heck.

2518
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:10,920
I love... I miss that guy.

2519
02:31:11,220 --> 02:31:11,880
He was my favorite.

2520
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:15,400
Thank God you're here meant to finish the game.

2521
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:15,860
