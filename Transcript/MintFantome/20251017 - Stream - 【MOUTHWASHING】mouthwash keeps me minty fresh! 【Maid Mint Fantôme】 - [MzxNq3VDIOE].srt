1
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,490
Where'd the game go?

2
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,690
Oh, there's the game.

3
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,080
We're fine.

4
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,020
Hello everybody.

5
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,160
Hi.

6
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm here with my mummy.

7
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,310
I don't know what.

8
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,430
I thought that was so funny.

9
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,270
I should have gotten in the bed too.

10
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,270
What a beautiful view.

11
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,610
Do you guys know that clip?

12
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,290
I like the view.

13
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,250
You're my best view.

14
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:31,590
Me.

15
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,330
The music, the new music is very chill.

16
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,090
No, thank you so much for the peep.

17
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,890
Thank you to thank you.

18
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,770
Hope you like cartoon horses.

19
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,350
Yeah, everybody, welcome to Mouthwashing!

20
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,630
This game was like the popular game last year.

21
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,190
And it's my turn to try it.

22
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,430
Close to one year anniversary of it, the three-point.

23
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,010
I know!

24
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,130
Sorry, physical therapy.

25
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,350
You got this!

26
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,410
Sorry, I can't...

27
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:46,670
I can't scroll up and you guys are sending so many things but thank you thank you thank you see that recently good smile announced the anya mouthwashing android i did i know it's kind of crazy because i was just like what should i play for something spooky and i was like you know i've never done mouthwashing so i i have brushed my teeth but but um but um yeah i was like maybe i could try it.

28
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,550
It's a little spooky.

29
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:01,110
I'm imagining you guys laughing like Tidus Titus, Final Fantasy X.

30
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,490
The Nendroid of her looks so cute though.

31
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,010
I will say I did watch a streamer play this game before.

32
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,930
But it was like one of those things.

33
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,270
where it's like I had them on in the background.

34
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,930
I don't really remember the game.

35
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,090
I don't think I paid attention like at all.

36
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,910
So, um, yeah, second monitor, uh, behavior there.

37
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,030
I don't even, I couldn't even tell you who I watched, to be honest.

38
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,110
I just remember having it on.

39
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,390
I don't even remember who it was.

40
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,090
So...

41
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,210
Uh...

42
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,410
So, no spoilers, I suppose.

43
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,950
Because it was...

44
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,030
Nimmy probably?

45
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,990
No, it was before Nimmy debuted.

46
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,950
Don't go assuming, I watch lots of people.

47
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,390
But I really don't remember.

48
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,450
It wasn't even a VTuber, you guys.

49
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,790
Stop asking.

50
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,790
I told you, I don't remember.

51
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,850
But I know it wasn't a V-Tuber.

52
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,310
It was a flesh person.

53
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,450
Feel this game.

54
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,910
Wait, is this game messed up in addition to scary?

55
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,210
I think it's messed up.

56
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,560
Right.

57
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
It's messed up.

58
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,340
Annoying Orange.

59
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,500
Oh my gosh, yes, it was annoying Orange.

60
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,460
Thank you.

61
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:05,360

63
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,460
How's the audio, by the way?

64
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,300
Oh, Pony Express Long Haul Space Fighter Topar.

65
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,960
Crew 5.

66
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,030
Planned shipment duration 382 days.

67
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,530
Like, are those space days or elapsed transit time?

68
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,090
147 days.

69
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,670
I hope this hurts.

70
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,530
Oh, okay.

71
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:34,970
Yowch.

72
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:43,950
Someone, someone, someone accidentally was writing their feelings in the logbook again.

73
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,210
They mixed up the logbook in their diary.

74
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,230
Whoa!

75
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,590
Zero days before the crash.

76
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,210
Uh-oh.

77
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,530
An orbital bot... Or... An orbital... Wait, no.

78
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:00,930
Sorry.

79
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:09,890
An orbital body has been detected 21 AU ahead of the vessel.

80
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,430
Please make a manual correction 1.4 degree leftwards to avoid impact with unknown mass.

81
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,150
Oh, gosh.

82
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,190
I have to do that.

83
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,390
What's the big red button do?

84
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,810
It's slacked.

85
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:27,890
Okay.

86
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,470
Give me now.

87
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,170
Okay.

88
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,970
This thing here.

89
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,630
Steer right.

90
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,470
Leave.

91
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,570
Steer right, no?

92
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,010
Trying to... Wait, or does this... Wait, does this bring us to the crash?

93
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:42,790
Oh, wait.

94
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,210
Oh, by bad.

95
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:44,890
Wait a second.

96
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,090
Extreme warning!

97
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,030
Direct collision course with orbital body 1.9 AU away.

98
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,830
Iceberg dead ahead!

99
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,110
Reaching autopilot to re-correct vessel.

100
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,730
Advise crew to take up emergency positions.

101
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,070
4,000 credits docked from crew pay package for failure of navigational staff.

102
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,730
My Christmas bonus.

103
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,830
Okay, why did I do that?

104
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,710
It's locked.

105
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,410
Okay, it's still...

106
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,570
Oh, oh, I can...

107
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,280

There's nothing else to be done.

111
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,340
Okay, can I leave?

112
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,600
I can't let anyone in.

113
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,460
Okay.

114
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
This autopilot sure has taken a long time.

115
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,000
Emergency cockpit console, override key!

116
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
Disengage autopilot.

117
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,820
Everybody!

118
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,170
Oh, wait, I can leave.

119
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,380
Polly says, don't be daft.

120
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,620
Don't be daft.

121
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,200
You'll cause a draft.

122
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,360
And then you'll catch a cold.

123
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,460
Where are we going?

124
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,400
What's this one?

125
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,160
Polly says, rise and shine.

126
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,390
Polly says, lend a hand.

127
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,110
Lend a hand.

128
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,070
Lend a hand.

129
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,030
So many doors.

130
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,390
Yeah, like, what's the point?

131
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,690
Oh, I guess maybe it's like a protective thing, right?

132
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,530
Well, we're about to crash anyway.

133
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,850
What's it?

134
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,030
There's something behind this door.

135
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,070
Oh, just kidding.

136
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,500
Wait, I'm scared.

137
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
Wait, I've got it scared.

138
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,360
I thought that was someone down the hall.

139
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,760
Oh, my goodness.

140
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,780
Oh, is...

141
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:52,900
Oh!

142
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,060
Oh!

143
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,000
Giddy up, Galaxy.

144
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
Well, I hear something, I feel.

145
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,420
Don't be daft, rise and shine, lend a hand.

146
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,320
Giddy up, Galaxy.

147
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,580
Is something chasing me or what there's...

148
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,080
Okay, I'm hearing my own footsteps.

149
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,480
Well, there's two ways we could... Oh, just kidding.

150
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,440
Crash is imminent, but I guess not soon enough.

151
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,460
So many posters.

152
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
Well, I think it really livens up the place, don't you think?

153
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,440
Oh.

154
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,720
I mean, I'm kind of scared.

155
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,570
Don't be daft.

156
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,370
I'm kind of scared.

157
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,730
I thought you guys said this was more...

158
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:53,990
Ah!

159
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,490
Oh.

160
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,270
Don't be daft.

161
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,290
A galaxy...

162
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:06,930
What was it?

163
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,730
Galaxy?

164
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,130
Oh, Gideon of Galaxy!

165
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,210
Maybe...

166
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,230
Do I have to tell his favorite one?

167
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,330
Do I hear babies cry?

168
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,160
Okay.

169
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,940
Oh, gosh.

170
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,000
Why is it now blinking?

171
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,520
Oh, God.

172
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,180
Is he gone?

173
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,080
Okay, I'm just gonna do that.

174
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,670
It's spooky, wait.

175
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,070
What are we gonna crash?

176
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:47,570
Please!

177
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,590
I'm stuck on board with a haunted horse!

178
00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:11,430
Oh Uh-oh I'm guessing it's telling me to go this way instead Well, there's nothing down there anyway Ah Oh, maybe This is why the thing could be done Our ship Spooky

179
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,910
Wait, he's...

180
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,770
Can I go around?

181
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,030
Can I get around Jipali?

182
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,550
Oh, yeah, he's got like...

183
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,850
He's like fused together.

184
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,190
Alright.

185
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,730
I'll just ignore him real quick.

186
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:30,930
Wait, wait.

187
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,590
Wait, did it change?

188
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,530
Am I crazy?

189
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,770
Am I going the right way?

190
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,820
Was there a door here?

191
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,180
No.

192
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,480
Wait, did I shut this?

193
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,340
Am I crazy?

194
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,320
She's crazy.

195
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,520
I shot this one.

196
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,980
I can't get around him.

197
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,760
Excuse me.

198
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,260
Let me through, please.

199
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,620
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

200
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,370
Oh, wait.

201
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,450
It shut again.

202
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,650
Crouch jump.

203
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,830
You can't jump in this game.

204
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,750
Maybe I go back.

205
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:40,590
this way I'm already locking I'm already what's it called but oh no oh no no oh no no what

206
00:17:48,770 --> 00:18:07,810
there's so many oh gosh there's so many ways to go I don't think the ship is supposed to fall apart before the crash right I don't think that's what's supposed to happen.

207
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,290
Unless we knew the ship was falling apart.

208
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,950
Hey, let me in!

209
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,640
Oh, two months after the crash, we lived!

210
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,420
Wait.

211
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,420
Oh, it's because we landed in the ocean.

212
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,450
Oh my goodness.

213
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,070
I don't know what voice to give Jimmy, because I'm not sure which one one is Jimmy.

214
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,710
Anyone else would do the same thing.

215
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,470
Oh.

216
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:50,890
Swansea.

217
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,370
We ain't touching the damn cargo.

218
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,810
The hold is locked down for a reason.

219
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,010
The only thing worse than dying slowly is not getting paid.

220
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,110
So true.

221
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,090
Oh, I'm Jimmy.

222
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,950
Okay, okay, okay.

223
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,890
But it could be something useful, I think.

224
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,450
Could be what?

225
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,690
Hope's dreams and Marzipan.

226
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,730
Marzipan.

227
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,650
More is a pain.

228
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:16,990
Ha!

229
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,570
You don't have to.

230
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,850
If it helps us survive, it's worth it.

231
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,630
Man, Pony Express bosses really aren't chill at all.

232
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,850
It just gives off shaggy vibes.

233
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,850
How exactly is this group therapy committee planning on getting in there?

234
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,050
Okay, I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna give up the voices.

235
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,010
Is that okay?

236
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,830
I'll try and do some of them, but for some reason I thought this game was voiced.

237
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,890
Maybe because I listened to somebody voice it.

238
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,870
Oh, right here, boss.

239
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,790
You're looking at the meanest swing of the regional junior baseball team.

240
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,530
Straight up nearly corked a kid once.

241
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,410
Why?

242
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,210
Why is that shaking?

243
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,270
Worked, kid.

244
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,090
I can take the utility action.

245
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,290
You were goddamn born fully corked.

246
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,190
That's enough, Swansea.

247
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,810
There has to be an in-case-of-emergency way inside.

248
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,850
If I remember correctly from the safety protocols, the doors should have an alternate access code.

249
00:20:47,870 --> 00:21:16,470
but it can only be uncovered using a code scanner device and only the captain has access to the scanner of course go ahead and ask him all about it then maybe he'll sing you the blues too I like the text effects we don't need them if we find the scanner get the code and open the hold for better or worse I'm captain Oh,

250
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:17,850
okay.

251
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,410
Swansea is a literal thumb with a face.

252
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,350
Don't say that.

253
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,890
I see it now.

254
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,470
I'll figure it out.

255
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,990
Right on.

256
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,310
Okay, so he's kind of got like a surfer attitude instead.

257
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,350
Nomestar runner reference.

258
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,790
I kind of, I see thumb and I also see like, a worm.

259
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,310
Acquire code scanner.

260
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,510
Alright, baby.

261
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:02,130
Oh, this guy, this guy, this guy literally haunting my dreams.

262
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,470
They actually sell plushies of this guy for kids.

263
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,590
Oh, he doesn't say, he only says one thing?

264
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,050
Polly says lend a hand.

265
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,890
Teamwork is the soul of success.

266
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,190
When you have completed your tasks, always check on other tasks.

267
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:36,770
tasks.

268
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,510
HR complaints about poor team synergy may result in collective punishment.

269
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,810
Collective punishment?

270
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,330
Polly says rise and shine.

271
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,790
Sleep is the best rest after a long day of work.

272
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,850
Earn that rest.

273
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,590
Don't overdo it or fall behind.

274
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,010
Do not indulge in over five hours of rest.

275
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,590
That's indulging five hours of rest.

276
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,170
Polly says get it up galaxy.

277
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,950
Punctual delivery is our pride and promise, no matter where you are.

278
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,270
Late deliveries will be docked from personal credits.

279
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,790
Polly says, don't be daft.

280
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,350
Proper preparation prevents accidents.

281
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,590
It is your responsibility to keep yourself and the crew safe.

282
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,510
Medical expenses will be docked from personal credits.

283
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,850
Oh my gosh!

284
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,030
Whoa!

285
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,870
So we've all been sleeping in here.

286
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,990
Good thing we had extra medical mattresses.

287
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,110
The floor isn't that bad.

288
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,970
Who's reading gaming mat?

289
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,990
Okay, this has got to be Daisuke's bed.

290
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,050
He's got a Game Boy and some weights and gaming magazine.

291
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,930
is a toothbrush, I guess?

292
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,050
Oh, whoa, sorry.

293
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,730
Insulation foam that was automatically discharged when the hole breached.

294
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,010
Locked off the compromised parts of the ship and kept us alive.

295
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,310
Whoa!

296
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,480
Whoa.

297
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,400
What's here?

298
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,300
Gelatin?

299
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,300
Sounds like my kind of meal.

300
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Water?

301
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,580
Restricted item?

302
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,380
Captain Axe is only...

303
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,480
It says sweetener.

304
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,540
How is that...

305
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,760
Tonic?

306
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,500
Cake recipe?

307
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,120
Mix water and gelatin.

308
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,620
Mix cake base and sweetener.

309
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
Enjoy Pony Express standard celebration cake.

310
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,040
Drink recipe.

311
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,040
Water and tonic.

312
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,440
Drink, base, and sweetener.

313
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,700
Enjoy Pony Express specialty mocktail drink.

314
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,300
Oh, whoops, my bad.

315
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,480
I forget it's right click.

316
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,360
Okay.

317
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,180
I guess I'll be making...

318
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,200
I'll be baking later.

319
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,560
It's a piece of cake to bake, I eat a cake.

320
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,780
Me, me, me, me, me, me, my...

321
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,560
Before we go there, okay, so I can run.

322
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,260
Oh, here's our food.

323
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,540
Spaghetti?

324
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,480
We'd be dead without this thing.

325
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,320
Never thought I'd be thankful for Pony Express Grub.

326
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,140
Coffee!

327
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,940
This machine was empty even before the crash.

328
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,420
Swansea sawed that.

329
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Aw.

330
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,300
Never mind.

331
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,260
This room is like, how...

332
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,240
You can't... I have to squint in here.

333
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,000
Ugh.

334
00:25:40,460 --> 00:26:11,480
Looks like it'll be soup again for dinner you want a rock paper scissors for the chicken noodle how much food do we have left i'd say like four months ish less than the remaining air supply but we can make it last in theory we'll be starting to poke new holes in our belts pretty soon to pull that off man my mom will straight up stuff me when i get back it'll look like swansy We'll have a rad story to tell them.

335
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,120
They might even write articles about us.

336
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,580
We could be on TV.

337
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
So this is in space.

338
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,760
Well, we crashed.

339
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,280
Somewhere.

340
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,860
It'll impress the ladies too.

341
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,360
Oh!

342
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,600
Hell yeah.

343
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,580
The real problem is us running out of toilet paper.

344
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,280
Fatal stuff, man.

345
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,980
leave that part out for the press.

346
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,420
Agreed.

347
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,060
Okay, so he's like a hymbo.

348
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,540
Oh, that's the gaming magazine.

349
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,120
What the?

350
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,940
Clown Mania.

351
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,820
Yeah.

352
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,980
Oh, my eyes, though.

353
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,340
My...

354
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,480
Oh, my gosh.

355
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,880
What's this way?

356
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,240
Whoa.

357
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,140
Whoa.

358
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,620
Okay, so we're We're looking for the scanner.

359
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,600
Oh,

360
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,670
how relaxing.

361
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,930
This room got messed up.

362
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,750
These are all we have left.

363
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,450
Take the pa- Wait, it won't- it doesn't- wait.

364
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,430
It won't let me click leave.

365
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,590
Wait.

366
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,610
Oh, did I take it on accident?

367
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,050
This vent has been busted forever, at least according to Swansea.

368
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,390
Probably beyond wrecked now.

369
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,440
I can hear him breathing.

370
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,500
He's staring at me.

371
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,600
He's behind my head, though.

372
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,180
You guys can't see him, but he's staring at me.

373
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,720
He doesn't want to keep still anymore.

374
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,160
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,320
He does not have any skin.

376
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,500
He has no choice.

377
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,620
What about the painkillers?

378
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,740
It just hurts him so much.

379
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,960
I can't stand the noise.

380
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,180
You did make it through nursing school.

381
00:28:31,200 --> 00:29:05,900
right a nursing school does not does not prepare you for for skinned man yeah this is just the beginning of of metal gear solid v pony express sure does know how to cut corners if nothing else anya's so cute um i was thinking we never went back into the cockpit after we dragged him out So it was him!

382
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,780
It's almost entirely foamed up.

383
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,060
Kind of a miracle Curly didn't end up fossilized.

384
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,980
But it could still be unstable.

385
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,740
I just think, well, it's the only place the code scanner could still be.

386
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,640
Otherwise, we're shit out of luck.

387
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,720
I'll take a look.

388
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,380
I know you'll figure it out, Jimmy.

389
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,400
You're so capable.

390
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:52,220
I don't You're You're so capable Jimmy I would believe her if it wasn't all like woozy like that Oh also Well um I was hoping you could help me with Captain Curly

391
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:05,430
Okay Jimmy Okay Uh Guy's still alive right?

392
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,530
I mean he's the captain Okay Just because you took over, you said you'll claim to be captain.

393
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,100
Okay, Jimmy.

394
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,140
His little power trip is already starting.

395
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,820
Right, sorry.

396
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,980
With Curly's medication.

397
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,980
People have to be worth their titles.

398
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,080
Don't you think?

399
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,480
Nurse Anya?

400
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,900
Oh, no!

401
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,300
We suck!

402
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,860
Yeah.

403
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,160
Forget I asked.

404
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,280
I'll take care of it.

405
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,080
I don't want...

406
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,360
I don't

407
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,810
want...

408
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,810
Wow, they...

409
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,410
It just...

410
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,390
It just...

411
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,710
It just peeled off.

412
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,490
It's like...

413
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,010
It's like...

414
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,770
Like a potato grater was taken down.

415
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:04,770
My goodness.

416
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:06,750
Oh!

417
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,450
Oh!

418
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,710
Can you talk?

419
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,210
Ah!

420
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,370
Oh my god.

421
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:14,930
Oh, it...

422
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:15,510
Pill time.

423
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,890
10 billion.

424
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,750
Oxycodone.

425
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,750
Extended release capsules.

426
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,650
The good stuff.

427
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,010
Old still, yeah?

428
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,430
Wait, I don't want to do this.

429
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,710
I don't like this any more than you do.

430
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,550
Oh, gosh.

431
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,150
Yum, jerky.

432
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,590
You know what they say.

433
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,850
Pain is how we know we're still living.

434
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,960
I can't bear to listen.

435
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,640
Excuse me, sorry.

436
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,800
Wait, listen to what?

437
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,320
What?

438
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,400
What?

439
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,640
It makes me want to breeze.

440
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Controversial opinion here.

441
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,760
I don't want to be skinned.

442
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,100
Like you were next on the list.

443
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,360
Curly ASMR.

444
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,740
I mean wouldn't it be more humane to like put him out of his misery?

445
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,080
I don't know man.

446
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,500
Oh gosh.

447
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,460
Doesn't get a signal anymore.

448
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,120
Unfortunately Anya and Swansea's playlists survive the crash.

449
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,880
This is nice music!

450
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,500
You're such a hater, Jimmy.

451
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,170
Oh, no.

452
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:54,670
Are you okay?

453
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,030
I'm checking on you, not as Jimmy, but as Minto.

454
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,050
We don't have a whole lot of painkillers left.

455
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,170
Yeah, that'll be fine.

456
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,330
But you still want to keep...

457
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,730
Why do you think he did it?

458
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,570
Does it matter?

459
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,310
What answer would make you feel any better?

460
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,730
I have to believe that our worst moments don't make us monsters, Jim.

461
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,090
I have to, even in this case.

462
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,550
He tried to take us all down with him, Anya.

463
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,310
The way I see it, there's two reasons to keep him alive at this point.

464
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,570
I guess the important bit is that we all agreed to it, for one reason or another.

465
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,590
I'm still feeling nauseous.

466
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,150
I need a minute.

467
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,610
Where'd you go?

468
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,670
You know what, let's not bother her.

469
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,030
Lysuke, why don't you help out of her?

470
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,410
Has Swansea been like this towards you for your whole internship?

471
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,110
That's just how he is, man.

472
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,050
Didn't want to spud like me following him around for an entire year.

473
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:10,310
The way Curly looks makes me think of Naraku from Yuna Yasha before he became a demon.

474
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,570
Oh, no.

475
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,230
to become consumed with his rage.

476
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,220
This isn't really the internship experience anyone had in mind.

477
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,260
He's getting great, uh, great experience.

478
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,160
He can, he'll be able to put all of this on his resume.

479
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:55,140
uh, overcoming, uh, difficult hurdles, uh, uh, problem solving, uh, uh, Oh gosh, it's been so long since I've done a resume.

480
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:10,780
Yeah, crisis management experience, patience, and having to be resourceful with supplies, team building.

481
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,140
You got this, you got this, Jimmy.

482
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,940
I mean, Daisuke?

483
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,580
Don't let him push you around too much.

484
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,820
His bark is worse than his bite.

485
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,980
He may be cranky, but he is legit a wizard of a mechanic.

486
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,860
I was like, you rock!

487
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,560
This is what years and years and years and years of experience looks like.

488
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm sure he appreciated that.

489
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,920
Yeah, his resume is about to be stacked, baby.

490
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,160
Hello, Minto.

491
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,760
Hi!

492
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,680
Hello, hello.

493
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,520
So medical.

494
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,580
Right on, daddy.

495
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,360
Thanks for the five.

496
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,760
Thank you for the five gifted!

497
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Thank you.

498
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,980
Before we go that way, because it seems kind of...

499
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,820
Far.

500
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,720
What's in here?

501
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,700
Oh, okay, never mind.

502
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,660
We do want to go.

503
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,060
Wait, what was over here?

504
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
Everything points to this way.

505
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,080
Nothing important, I suppose.

506
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,140
Why is this room like so 70s looking?

507
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,200
Okay.

508
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,200
They're making Curly barbecue when the food runs out.

509
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,820
Oh, no!

510
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,560
Don't say that!

511
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,820
Beef jerky for all.

512
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,240
Well, they did say there was less food than air available.

513
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,140
Oh, this also leads...

514
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, so it's a circle.

515
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,520
Hi, Anya.

516
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,240
She's so cute.

517
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,320
Thank you for helping with Curly.

518
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,660
Did you find the code scanner?

519
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,920
I hope it's still there.

520
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,200
The cockpit is covered in...

521
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,620
phone.

522
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,520
I haven't checked.

523
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,040
Is this it?

524
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,160
No, there's no zero!

525
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,900
I can't put in eight, zero, zero, eight.

526
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,900
It's the universal unlock code.

527
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,020
It's like the Konami code of codes.

528
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:16,900
Membita.

529
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,520
Welcome back.

530
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,360
Thank you.

531
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,700
Captain has been equipped with a standard issue code scanner to unlock the door.

532
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,300
Oh yeah, okay.

533
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,860
This is the lounge.

534
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,900
Where were we then if this is the lounge?

535
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,850
Okay, we're going up.

536
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,420
Wow, what a cozy, very not claustrophobic.

537
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,200
Oh.

538
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,340
Not claustrophobic.

539
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,090
place.

540
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,030
Oh, here we go.

541
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:03,410
Okay.

542
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,930
I was like, there's got to be something else.

543
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:06,650
Swansea.

544
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,730
Ain't you supposed to be figuring out our great cargo robbery?

545
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,050
Why are you standing out here?

546
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,410
None of your goddamn business.

547
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,310
Everything is my business now because of Curly.

548
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,930
I don't want to keep having this conversation.

549
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,550
Everyone is such good friends here, huh?

550
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,110
Right, right.

551
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,790
Cap... Cap... Cap... Cap... Cap...

552
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,330
Retino.

553
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,370
I'm working.

554
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,590
Blue-collar fools can't afford to stop working, even when the machine does.

555
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:37,750
Go figure.

556
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,610
And before you start, I'm taking a break.

557
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,730
Don't you worry.

558
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,290
I ain't going over my break time allowance.

559
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,730
Ha!

560
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,650
Working on what?

561
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,450
How does it look in there?

562
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,650
It's a solid wall of foe.

563
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,170
Swansea seems like Kiso.

564
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,050
How?

565
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:02,950
I'm trying to see if I can break it down enough to get something useful out, any of my tools.

566
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,810
But if I breach that foam and break the air seal, it's lights out for all of us.

567
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,650
I ain't letting anyone else mess around in there.

568
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,230
Even Daisuke?

569
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,350
He's your intern.

570
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,630
He's supposed to be helpful.

571
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,590
You think I'm letting that knucklehead in here after the crash roughed it up?

572
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:28,150
Our so-called nurse nearly skewered her leg when the vent hatch was open during maintenance.

573
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:46,860
And that crash i warned her but it's in one ear and out the other then there's that teeny bopper thinking only with his downstairs long nose he's in space what is there to think about

574
00:39:51,720 --> 00:40:04,640
don't we all a downstairs long nose like squidward just like Like my useless kids back home.

575
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,780
You have a...

576
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,620
You have kids?

577
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,120
So no.

578
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,500
Ain't letting anyone mess around in here.

579
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,300
Alright, Swansea.

580
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,580
Keep me updated.

581
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,080
Okay.

582
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,120
Well...

583
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,090
So I'm guessing the big room...

584
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,410
Okay.

585
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,510
Where Anya was standing.

586
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,210
I thought it was the cockpit at first.

587
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,010
But it is...

588
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:45,190
It's the store like the storage where they keep all the packages.

589
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,890
Oh, it's not so foamed up in here, surprisingly.

590
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,710
Open the cargo hall.

591
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,450
That's the word.

592
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,430
Wait, it's actually like not so bad in here.

593
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,580
A length of rope.

594
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,000
Why not need that for something?

595
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:21,760
protection kit is there anything we can grab in here or look at or anything no okay

596
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:42,170
this pipe must have broken off during the crash I can barely see it, it's so dark okay, cool thank you so much for the five gifted dag oh you always have a new profile file picture.

597
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,850
Alright, baby.

598
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:47,390
Oh.

599
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,070
Swansea hasn't let anyone in utility since the crash.

600
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,470
It says it's filled with foam.

601
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,150
Is it?

602
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,030
Or is he just building a secret fort in there?

603
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,370
No girls allowed.

604
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,370
Oh, hello, everybody.

605
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,190
I'm glad we could all gather.

606
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,830
Well, get on with it.

607
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,050
This is all you.

608
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:33,250
I want it duly noted that no involvement in this no grills allowed what do you guys think we've been shipping if it's spare parts maybe me and Swansea can repair the ship and we can get out of here oh my gosh he has a brain right Swansea quit yapping his

609
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:45,880
his shirt does look kind of like goofy no like his he looks like looks like Charlie brown a little bit.

610
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,720
Is that the... Oh, wait!

611
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,700
You're wearing one, too!

612
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,600
That's just the uniform.

613
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,560
Anya's not, though.

614
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,760
She has fashion sense.

615
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,400
Are we doing the right thing?

616
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,320
Let it be medicine, food, or water.

617
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,820
Here I go.

618
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:06,760
Wait.

619
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,200
Scan, scan, scan, scan, scan, scan.

620
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,760
How do I... How do I scan?

621
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,500
I don't know the code.

622
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,200
Wait.

623
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,600
Tab.

624
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,060
tab.

625
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,560
Used to reveal access code across the Tollpar.

626
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,180
Oh!

627
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,220
Oh, this?

628
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,280
No?

629
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:24,920
Wait.

630
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,120
Across where?

631
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Toriko, thank you for the vibe.

632
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:29,340
Get that in.

633
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,120
Touch you, oh my gosh.

634
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,040
Thank you for the 20 gifts.

635
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,000
Thank you so much!

636
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,740
Across where?

637
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,300
The black bar.

638
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,240
It is the black bar?

639
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,260
Okay, that's what I thought.

640
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,340
Ah, here we go.

641
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:46,660
seven.

642
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,360
Okay, cool.

643
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,850
What if it...

644
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,110
Whoa, there's so much in here.

645
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,170
What if it was, like, exploded, though, you know?

646
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:09,410
Oh.

647
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,150
What's happening?

648
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:11,570
Oh!

649
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,570
Gosh, I thought my game just...

650
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,130
Seven days before the crash.

651
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,610
Are you listening?

652
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,610
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,130
Damn.

654
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,310
I'm so sorry.

655
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,050
Couldn't sleep again.

656
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,270
But I passed the Psyche Val.

657
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:57,870
well you gave the same answers as last time i do wish you'd open up a little more captain these evaluations aren't just about you how i can't i the only way i know how he looks is like like beef jerky i don't know how to voice that yeah i thought my game crashed no i thought it broke as long as i'm fit to fly in your eyes on you means I have only one more eval left to do.

658
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,970
He acts as if I do these things for fun.

659
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:09,730
Then I have to make a report with things like I have found myself...

660
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:12,670
Ah-ha!

661
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,680
I think I've seen like the like screenshot or whatever of this.

662
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,000
I have found myself sexually excited at the sight of cartoon horses.

663
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:33,770
Jimmy's a brony.

664
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,370
Well, I could take it off your hands.

665
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,610
I've known him a long time.

666
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,670
He won't try any bullshit with me.

667
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,150
Voice him like macho man Randy Savage.

668
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,050
I suppose you are the captain.

669
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,150
I am the captain.

670
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:52,470
Thank you.

671
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,530
What a relief.

672
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,510
Requesting permission to clip out of context, sir.

673
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,260
There's worse things in me out there.

674
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,100
Go ahead.

675
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,720
Oh, before I forget, Swansea asked me to give you this.

676
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,600
They can't expect me to perform miracles.

677
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,580
Not sure what it means, but sounds like fun.

678
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,140
Good luck, Captain.

679
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,020
I'm curly!

680
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,800
Talk to Jimmy and Swansea.

681
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:38,620
Thaiske described his experience as intern so far as, Super cool and, like, totally awesome.

682
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,540
Like, awesome.

683
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,920
Should I be worried?

684
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,950
What a beautiful day it is.

685
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,530
Swansea and Daisuke have been fixing this broken vent for days.

686
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:57,730
Best to stay away.

687
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,850
All the pills.

688
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:01,830
Little does he know.

689
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,090
This will be his meal.

690
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,450
We are here for you.

691
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:41,010
anxiety you are enough all feelings are okay you are valid not all thoughts are true you are not alone you will be alright this feeling will pass you are not a burden this does not define you everybody loves clean what are these What is this one?

692
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,590
Oh, it's like another anxiety thing.

693
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,430
I like the Polaroids.

694
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,010
They're cute.

695
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,190
Everybody loves clean.

696
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:53,510
This is gonna be your bed.

697
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,710
Wait, this is...

698
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:56,250
Scary.

699
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,010
I've been bringing the same playlist along for years.

700
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:00,630
When it's right, it's right.

701
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,230
So true?

702
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,450
Alright, Swansean.

703
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:10,890
Jimmy.

704
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,930
Sorry, I had to stop myself from calling him Johnny.

705
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:15,850
Whoa!

706
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:18,690
A trucker's kind of meals.

707
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,050
Kind of fast, kind of cheap, kind of edible.

708
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:22,630
Wait, you have to pay for these?

709
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,810
You're on company...

710
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,090
You are away on company work and you pay for your food?

711
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,640
This thing's been out of coffee for over a month.

712
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,440
It's for the best.

713
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,940
The caffeine keeps me up anyway.

714
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,680
Work makes the dream work.

715
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,420
Yay!

716
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,000
He should have said nay!

717
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,300
Teamwork makes the dream work!

718
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,900
Alright, let's go find some guys.

719
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,240
Um, what's over here?

720
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,760
Since we didn't get to...

721
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,480
Oh, the door to my quarters!

722
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,060
I'm still on the clock though.

723
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,240
Ah, where does everyone else sleep?

724
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,560
What if you need to party?

725
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,140
Hmm.

726
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:23,200
Ney is like no though But Ney is

727
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:41,200
This is Big Head Jimmy right here Okay buddy We'll come back to you What happened Oh my god Daisuke

728
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:51,990
Well I can see the issue The kid was brought on just to make me suffer.

729
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,810
Interned my ass.

730
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,490
I was just trying to fix the vent.

731
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,310
How did that trigger the emergency foe?

732
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:05,670
Because you're talented in all the wrong ways.

733
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:10,070
I would have dealt with this, but only you could unlock the axe case.

734
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,530
Every goddamn thing has to go through you.

735
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:14,990
Oh, okay.

736
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,350
I'm the captain.

737
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,110
It's so we don't have craziness on board.

738
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:21,630
I'll handle it.

739
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:22,670
Hang in there, Daisuke.

740
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,690
It looks really comfy.

741
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,370
Put me in the foam, Caton.

742
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,630
Do not touch.

743
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,030
What's this thing?

744
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,290
Seems like Swansea is teaching Daisuke the basics.

745
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:38,450
He's got a long way to go.

746
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,510
The music's kind of...

747
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:45,970
What are these?

748
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,770
Oh, emergency cryogenic pods.

749
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,850
They have about 20 years of backup power.

750
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:51,750
Oh.

751
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,650
Oh, this is the utility room.

752
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,970
Wait, before we get the axe, let's talk to this guy.

753
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,710
Then Pony Express said they don't provide on-board entertainment.

754
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,990
Feels like there's always something broken in that room.

755
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,590
Tollpar's starting to show her age.

756
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:16,650
Pass inspection, right?

757
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,770
Shouldn't be an issue.

758
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:21,210
Plus they added die scale last minute.

759
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,050
Sorry, didn't it count there'd be five of us now?

760
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,310
I really should have made a bigger stink about that.

761
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:33,910
Oh no!

762
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:36,270
Daisuke!

763
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,290
Uh, oh.

764
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,470
My code scanner!

765
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,430
I can't read it.

766
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,150
Uh, two six zero nine.

767
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,130
This is cool, I like this part.

768
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,410
Two, six, zero, nine.

769
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:58,790
Take axe.

770
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,290
Here's Jimmy.

771
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,210
Oh, wait.

772
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,790
Do I need to use axe?

773
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:11,610
Okay, I'll be careful.

774
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,050
Watch your toes.

775
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,930
Oh, my God.

776
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,770
Oh, my God.

777
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:19,770
Oh, my God.

778
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:20,950
Oh, my God.

779
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,610
Hi, Rees!

780
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:32,940
Ouch!

781
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,420
Oof.

782
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,340
Strong stuff, huh?

783
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,320
Get it through your goddamn skull.

784
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,400
That vent is strictly off-limits.

785
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Fully effing collapsed inside.

786
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,300
You looking to get impaled, electrocuted, and cooked?

787
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,300
Yeah, but like, you can't fit in there to fix it, right?

788
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,180
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

789
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,200
So I can totally handle it.

790
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,100
Captain, give me the axe.

791
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,540
Swansea, this could have damaged the pods.

792
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,440
Gurren, welcome back.

793
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,100
Thank you.

794
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,480
You can't let something like this happen again.

795
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,300
Yeah, yeah.

796
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,580
I got it.

797
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,400
Loud and clear.

798
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,960
Keep the axe until you've cleaned this all up, yeah?

799
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,440
Wait, so, but don't we want to not clean up the foam?

800
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,440
Because that means that there's...

801
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,420
hole those loose electrical wires are a hazard in itself especially with dice get around

802
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:52,110
um yes jimmy can i help you this is before the crash yeah i know but like isn't that still what they are meant what the foam is meant to do

803
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,780
I take it, Anya, diagnosed you with being sane, then?

804
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,820
Just off-center, but it's what keeps me on my toes.

805
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,020
I said I'd do yours.

806
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,680
I want to hear all about those cartoon horses.

807
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,300
Is that something you were born with or a recent developer?

808
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,460
All right, all right, shut up.

809
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,560
Let's go to the cockpit.

810
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,450
Yes, sir.

811
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,490
I mean, I'm the sir.

812
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:59,680
sir yeah wait where was the cockpit was it down this way were you born this freaky or is it a recent development there's a what was it there's like a new I never played puppet combo games before but there's a new one that just came out and it's called like skin freak or something I was like this is made for me I I was born,

813
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,040
freaky died, freaky.

814
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,500
Born in the afterlife, freaky.

815
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,820
Whoa, wait.

816
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,780
This is not the cockpit.

817
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,000
Wait, what's going on?

818
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,240
Wait, what's happening?

819
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,580
It all started when they released this game called Umamusume.

820
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,540
Wait, what's happening?

821
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,640
The music stopped.

822
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,570
Oh my, wow!

823
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,130
That's pretty steep.

824
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,190
Oh.

825
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,090
Oh, do I have a flashlight?

826
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,140
Jimmy?

827
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,680
Uh, Anya, I think you misdiagnosed me.

828
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,160
Sane?

829
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:58,590
Oh.

830
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,010
Whoa.

831
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:01,450
Whoa.

832
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,780
Aurora Borealis.

833
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:15,960
Oh.

834
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,340
Oh.

835
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,240
Okay, now it's spooky.

836
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:21,740
Wait.

837
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,640
Wait, I don't like it anymore.

838
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,200
What?

839
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,020
I don't like it anymore.

840
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,980
I don't like it anymore.

841
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:34,700
Why?

842
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:38,290
Oh.

843
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,050
Fell to the end of Ava, right?

844
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:44,950
Big staircase.

845
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,550
You're supposed to insert your own music.

846
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:48,710
Umapioi!

847
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:49,850
No, umapioi!

848
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,770
Oh, we're having vision.

849
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,230
Visions.

850
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:01,110
Are we, like, going back to how curly is in present day?

851
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,810
Where's the horse?

852
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:18,810
Oh, whoa.

853
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:20,450
Did it say?

854
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,010
Where's the horse?

855
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,440
Oh, whoa.

856
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,820
I don't understand the ladders that keep popping up.

857
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:42,680
Ah!

858
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,040
Oh, no!

859
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:44,740
Oh!

860
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,820
Oh, I can't look away!

861
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,220
Ah!

862
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:00,210
My eyes!

863
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,730
Is that a door?

864
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,310
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

865
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,810
Oh, my eyes!

866
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,250
Oh.

867
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:24,530
Ah.

868
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,430
Whoa.

869
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,750
Jimmy, what kind of renovations did you do to this place?

870
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,310
Jimmy bet me 50 credits this thing will never see the outside.

871
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,630
out of this locker.

872
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,530
So far, he's winning.

873
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,250
There's the key.

874
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,690
I need to leave this here just in case.

875
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,090
Did we not want to do it?

876
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,310
Wait.

877
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,460
739.

878
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,560
But where do I put it in?

879
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,620
Oh.

880
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,520
Not sure this geriatric thing would be any use in a real emergency.

881
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,120
swans, swears they're more reliable than anything made this deck in.

882
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,380
Ha.

883
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,220
Okay.

884
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,260
Hello, Jimbo?

885
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,700
You can't just make something up for this?

886
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,320
It's not like these evals ever go anywhere when we get back.

887
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,320
We'll power through it.

888
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,900
Have you been able to complete your mandated tasks as co-pilot efficiently and to your fullest capacity?

889
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,420
Oh, well.

890
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,220
Let's see.

891
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,440
Okay.

892
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,640
I'll just put good for that one.

893
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,620
That's all of them.

894
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,740
Done and done.

895
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,700
How were things otherwise?

896
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:10,640
Off the record.

897
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,360
I like it.

898
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,340
We're in control here.

899
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,000
That's weird.

900
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,340
That's a weird thing to say.

901
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:24,560
Didn't think you'd ever take to being a freighter pilot as well as you have.

902
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,340
With how you struggle back on Earth.

903
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:28,980
Sure.

904
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,000
All I ever hear is how great of a leader you are.

905
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,060
Jimmy...

906
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:39,260
Freighter?

907
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,500
What did I say?

908
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,100
Oh!

909
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,350
Freighter.

910
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:48,870
Sorry.

911
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,270
Jimmy's so jealous.

912
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:52,870
I don't!

913
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,010
Honestly, it's kind of annoying.

914
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,870
Okay.

915
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,230
What?

916
01:00:59,290 --> 01:00:59,950
Why is it annoying?

917
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:59,910
sorry i'm starting to give him like a dice gay accent so what is it hmm how come it always always seems like you're standing on the edge of a bridge with your feet in cement lately i've just been thinking is this enough should i just stay here because i've been successful at it a good long haul freighter captain and that's bad that's what i'm i'm saying it's not but it's terrifying i think am i figured out is this all i'll ever be or do i take the risk and try something new even if i'm bad at it i get it though change is scary especially if you're comfortable you know i guess i get it you reach the highest rung on this ladder

918
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,330
So now you're thinking you might be on the wrong ladder altogether.

919
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:12,450
Still, a long way, uh, still a long way down from the top no matter how you look at it.

920
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,870
While I'm still climbing and climbing.

921
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:18,370
Something like that.

922
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,830
But hey, hey, hey, you know I believe in you.

923
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:23,830
Here.

924
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,130
On earth.

925
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:27,190
Doesn't matter.

926
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,750
Oh, here, on earth.

927
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,190
Yeah, it doesn't matter where.

928
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,650
Aww.

929
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:32,490
Ha.

930
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,570
You should write that on a site, on the psych eval.

931
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:40,410
Message incoming!

932
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,130
Oh no, the big guys themselves.

933
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,590
Hay is for horses.

934
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,270
Sorry.

935
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:55,390
That was me trying to nay.

936
01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:00,490
I don't think I'm having, I don't think I've cut out for being a horse girl.

937
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,970
Guess that's my cue.

938
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,490
I'll see you later.

939
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,110
Okay, bye.

940
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,530
What are they asking for?

941
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,130
Oh, take news from corporate.

942
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:21,810
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no!

943
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,070
Wait, what's it say?

944
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,230
Take, take what?

945
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,570
Wait, oh, why?

946
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,530
Why is it so dark?

947
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:31,370
I can't see anything.

948
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,230
This flashlight is dukey.

949
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,610
Okay, let's just go forward.

950
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,650
Curly has really changed ever since he left Mo and Larry!

951
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,030
Wait, this...

952
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,870
This is kind of spooky.

953
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,270
Take your beds, yeah!

954
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,960
Why is it red?

955
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:02,750
And then failed her audition to become a cartoon horse.

956
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,790
I sure did.

957
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,060
Love cartoons!

958
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,060
Whoa, hello nurse!

959
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,760
We're all starting to get a thing for worse.

960
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,160
What are you talking about?

961
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,820
It was the worst impression ever.

962
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,160
Oh my gosh.

963
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,280
This is what they mean when they say so many fish in the sea.

964
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,100
They're all on the beach.

965
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:38,020
Wait.

966
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,120
Wait, did it just loop?

967
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:01,160
I think it just looped.

968
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,500
Turn it back down just in case there's a jump scare.

969
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:12,920
has jump scares or not it feels like the beginning of mgs4 where i'm watching the different tv channels

970
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:44,630
whoa time for me to go eat some cake since my birthday marco happy birthday what is this i don't like it

971
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,790
whoa what's it called is

972
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:15,650
on tv oh that's my channel spooky scary skeletons and shivers up your spine oh you

973
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:35,320
know when spongebob's watching that like that like channel where it's got like the the dancing dancing of anemone and gary comes in he's like gary I wasn't watching anything.

974
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,640
That's what I feel like watching this channel is like where you're just like...

975
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:47,430
You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

976
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:50,390
We're getting a little, we're getting a little heated in here.

977
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:08,090
A revolutionary new dental hygiene product.

978
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,630
Wait, is this the mouthwash?

979
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:15,010
Brand new formula designed to kill bacteria and kill germs without leaving a bad taste.

980
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,810
Dragon breath.

981
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,410
Mouthwash.

982
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,070
All day, fire fresh.

983
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,320
My game is broken again.

984
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,380
Two months after the crash.

985
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,780
It's...

986
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,580
This is...

987
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,580
Mouthwash?

988
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,380
Unfreaking believable.

989
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,480
There's gotta be an...

990
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,780
ocean of the stuff in here.

991
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,760
No way!

992
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,540
It's all mouthwash!

993
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,400
This room looks freaking endless.

994
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,360
This is what they'd have five people hauling for over a year.

995
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,080
All of this?

996
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,480
For mouthwash?

997
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,360
The sugar content probably offsets any potential as disinfectant.

998
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,560
Disinfectant.

999
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:18,140
What are you...

1000
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,780
Let me see that.

1001
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,540
What are you checking?

1002
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,880
14% ethanol.

1003
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:25,780
Ha!

1004
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,840
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1005
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,340
What?

1006
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,840
I suppose we'll smell good at least.

1007
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:36,720
What?

1008
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,360
That's right, kiddo.

1009
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,320
You can bet your ass on that.

1010
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,480
What are you doing?

1011
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:43,880
Stop that!

1012
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,260
Wait, why is he drinking it?

1013
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,500
It's basically booze.

1014
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:53,860
Oh.

1015
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,280
I thought ethanol was like gasoline.

1016
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:07,250
Woo!

1017
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,310
Oh, shut up.

1018
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,150
They do put it in gas.

1019
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,250
Oh, okay.

1020
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:17,810
It's alcohol.

1021
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:19,070
Pure alcohol.

1022
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:21,250
Uh-oh.

1023
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:22,290
That's not good.

1024
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,750
I'm just an old...

1025
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:25,610
Codger?

1026
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,710
Taking care of his dental hygiene.

1027
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:29,270
You hear that?

1028
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:33,470
That's the sound of 15 years of sobriety popping like a siss.

1029
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,070
Wait, so...

1030
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,470
So if you wanted to...

1031
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:43,030
If you wanted to clean your mouth, if you...

1032
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:47,050
If you actually washed it out with, like...

1033
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:50,050
I don't know...

1034
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,150
Vodgons?

1035
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,290
Does that work?

1036
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,720
You could do that.

1037
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,260
But I guess because of the sugar, it wouldn't work as like a disinfectant, like she said.

1038
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,080
You could.

1039
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:08,960
Oh, my God.

1040
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,060
Wow.

1041
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,200
Wow.

1042
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:20,630
Oh, I'm learning.

1043
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:25,950
It would kill the bacteria.

1044
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:28,310
Wow.

1045
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,190
You could as long as you don't swap.

1046
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:47,690
okay that's I've I've never had vodka I thought it never had a taste because it's clear I don't know what it tastes like

1047
01:10:50,980 --> 01:11:03,400
it burns tastes like burning what it's

1048
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,300
It's not good.

1049
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,780
It's fire fresh.

1050
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,640
A glorious magnificent red hot cyst.

1051
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,300
Good riddance and cheers.

1052
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,160
Why did my kid say he's turning into a pirate?

1053
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,320
To Captain Curly.

1054
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,200
Here here.

1055
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,540
Guess anyone could get seriously blasted off of this stuff.

1056
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,580
Yeah, and kill you in the process.

1057
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,380
This can't be real.

1058
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,220
I, there's no way.

1059
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,760
Now we go out in style.

1060
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,700
Arrg.

1061
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,560
Dysky.

1062
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,820
Come here, me boy.

1063
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,860
I can't even remember how I talk.

1064
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,120
Anyone ever teach you how to drink like a man?

1065
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,100
Oh, no.

1066
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:58,340
This is so...

1067
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,260
Oh, I think we're transitioning somewhere.

1068
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:00,780
Oh, yeah.

1069
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,020
Six days before the crash.

1070
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,120
Who...

1071
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,420
Break the news.

1072
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,180
I need to tell them.

1073
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,200
News from corporate.

1074
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,960
After all these years, just like that.

1075
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:12,960
Wait, what?

1076
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:13,260
What?

1077
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:13,620
What?

1078
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,420
Mr. Krabs, when did you get in this game?

1079
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,840
We're breaking the news.

1080
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,500
Are they firing all of us?

1081
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:35,550
Surprise!

1082
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:38,170
Surprise!

1083
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,010
Look at your face.

1084
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,690
Read the note, it wouldn't let me.

1085
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:46,890
You ever got so drunk?

1086
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:54,770
you turn into a pirate all it took was that guy one one sippy gotcha

1087
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:14,910
jeez uh wow uh what's the occasion we only get one communal birthday party per trip right so we can have it whenever only one person can really be surprise birthday per trip.

1088
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:17,870
We did Swansea last haul, remember?

1089
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:21,470
No way, I can't believe I missed that.

1090
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,450
You were next on the list, so congratulations.

1091
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:30,610
Hate to say it though, your duties have to extend to even your own birthday party.

1092
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,750
You're the only one with clearance to make the cake.

1093
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,130
The recipe is there by the machine.

1094
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,390
Hop to it, Captain.

1095
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,310
Wait, I am making the cake now.

1096
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,190
Break a cake.

1097
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:44,630
The music's so cute.

1098
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:45,090
Wait.

1099
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:46,690
I can't.

1100
01:13:46,810 --> 01:13:48,590
It won't let me read the note.

1101
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:49,830
I don't think.

1102
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,970
Yeah, I keep clicking and it's not letting me.

1103
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:55,350
Wow.

1104
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:56,230
So cute.

1105
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:56,590
Oh.

1106
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:57,670
Everybody.

1107
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,290
That's a really big knife.

1108
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:04,690
Holy moly.

1109
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:07,190
Oh, we have a spaghetti.

1110
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:08,730
What do we need this knife for?

1111
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:12,730
Gemma.

1112
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,330
Sorry for jumping you.

1113
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:16,930
This whole thing is corny.

1114
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,470
But you know, it's kind of a tradition now.

1115
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,210
Okay, it's not corny.

1116
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,870
It's sweet.

1117
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,630
I dare say I almost look forward to it.

1118
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:26,250
Hmm?

1119
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:27,510
Nothing.

1120
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,350
Yeah, no, I agree.

1121
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:32,610
Oh, I think we're...

1122
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:33,510
We've been sacked.

1123
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,370
Did you just say Mondays aren't the best, but coworkers can make it better?

1124
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,240
The music is so cute.

1125
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:02,250
Yeah, I was going to say, or worse, like, way worse.

1126
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:08,790
You're going to use the Pony Express provided cake recipe?

1127
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:10,310
At least make it correctly.

1128
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,250
You should find the ingredients and recipe in the kitchen.

1129
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,510
Swansea really likes that cake.

1130
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:16,730
Don't tell anyone.

1131
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:17,790
Humph.

1132
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,330
He's so too nitted.

1133
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,210
Hmm, I think you need to use the code scanner.

1134
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:26,510
They're really getting a lot of mileage out of that thing, huh?

1135
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,270
You know how it is.

1136
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:31,270
Pony Express being either cheap or lazy.

1137
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,030
Usually both, no?

1138
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:34,530
Okay.

1139
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:36,510
Oh, what about you, Daisuke?

1140
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:37,410
What do you have to say?

1141
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:42,250
Could you sneak an extra packet of sweetener in there?

1142
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:44,690
Just kidding.

1143
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,990
Maybe?

1144
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,850
Nah, totally kidding.

1145
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,850
Unless?

1146
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,770
It's been dead I pirate.

1147
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,170
More likely than you think.

1148
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,910
Okay, wait, that's a Campbell soup.

1149
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:02,430
What is this thing for?

1150
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:03,990
Okay, hold on.

1151
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,210
Alright, we read this earlier.

1152
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:07,650
We're professionals already.

1153
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:13,130
We mix water and gelatin.

1154
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:20,210
Water, take, and gelatin, doko.

1155
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,790
And also, where do we mix it?

1156
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:30,150
Eh?

1157
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:32,370
Yeah.

1158
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:34,770
Uh.

1159
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,770
Hold on, everybody.

1160
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:38,570
I'm the captain.

1161
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,150
I'm the captain.

1162
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:43,230
Those balloons are hard.

1163
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:45,470
Check the recipe again.

1164
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:46,330
What did I miss?

1165
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,800
It says I need the scanner, but I don't see where.

1166
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:59,460
Oh, here!

1167
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,260
Here, here!

1168
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:01,220
Ah!

1169
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,320
Oh, I see!

1170
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,820
Wait, but gelatin doesn't... Oh, 4213.

1171
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,300
Where do I put in the code, though?

1172
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:21,410
Not now.

1173
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:22,930
Okay, my bad.

1174
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,940
Oh, there's bird sounds.

1175
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,080
Is this not a window?

1176
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,780
Oh, I thought...

1177
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,800
I thought this whole time it was a window.

1178
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:46,990
Um...

1179
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,190
I like how sweetener is, like, behind me.

1180
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:55,210
Where do I get the...

1181
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:56,790
Gelatin?

1182
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:00,490
Cake base plus sweetener.

1183
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:05,690
There's also no thing for cake base.

1184
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:06,670
Unless it's...

1185
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:09,170
This becomes the cake base.

1186
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,210
Wait.

1187
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:16,210
Oh!

1188
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,470
Wait, hold on.

1189
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:17,930
Hold on.

1190
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:18,610
What was it again?

1191
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:20,390
I didn't realize there was numbers.

1192
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:22,590
4, 2, 1, 3.

1193
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:23,010
Okay.

1194
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:31,950
Whoa, I thought this was a pancake maker.

1195
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:36,730
All right.

1196
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,150
Joseph, use.

1197
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:42,130
Water, use.

1198
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:46,930
Okay.

1199
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,070
Whoa, okay.

1200
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,970
And then we need you.

1201
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,670
Two, three, four, one.

1202
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:04,650
2-3-4-1, 2-3-4-1, 2-3-4-1, 2-3-4-1

1203
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,590
Yes, take the sweetener!

1204
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:20,890
Um...

1205
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,010
Wait, uh, where should I use it?

1206
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,190
Wait, maybe here, again?

1207
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,510
Ah, okay, okay.

1208
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:28,530
Sweetener?

1209
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:29,930
Mix!

1210
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:39,230
Throw in some extra sweetener?

1211
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:41,470
Whoa.

1212
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,250
That's so cute!

1213
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,370
What else?

1214
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:51,770
Oh, that's it.

1215
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,210
Yay!

1216
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:54,590
Yay, yay!

1217
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,910
It wouldn't let me do an extra pack, though, because we could only...

1218
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,170
Right?

1219
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,930
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1220
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,560
I want to make the drink.

1221
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,350
Oh!

1222
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:13,110
Gosh.

1223
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:15,390
They're so fast.

1224
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,550
You gotta make a speech.

1225
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,290
Can't argue with that.

1226
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,430
Speech, speech, speech, speech.

1227
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:27,050
Go on.

1228
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:28,790
I...

1229
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,510
Hey, what's wrong?

1230
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:32,070
Uh-oh.

1231
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:33,450
He's breaking the news.

1232
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:37,530
That's all I said on the report from management.

1233
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,210
We will receive the paycheck for this delivery.

1234
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:43,870
I don't know any more than that.

1235
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:48,930
Pony Express finally kicking the bucket, huh?

1236
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:50,730
What a joke.

1237
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,770
and we're the punchline.

1238
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,650
I don't have any savings.

1239
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,150
Anya, no!

1240
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:57,590
Anya!

1241
01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:58,970
Oh my god.

1242
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,210
Come live with me, baby girl.

1243
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:03,870
They can't just do this, right?

1244
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:08,630
Pony Express was one of the last man crew.

1245
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:14,010
Pony Express, sorry, freighter companies.

1246
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,830
The writing's been on the wall for a long time.

1247
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:19,810
When did they tell you?

1248
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:50,050
earlier this week I was instructed to wait until we're closer to the hall destination but I can't keep something like this from you all so I guess you got what you wanted don't say that Jimmy yeah without the guilt ah Jim Jim if I had known I can go back to my,

1249
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:50,970
how'd you put it?

1250
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:52,990
Struggle of a life.

1251
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:58,370
Anya never got into medical school because she's, well, let's be real.

1252
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:00,470
What is that supposed to mean?

1253
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,170
And how many employment years?

1254
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:03,490
Swansea got left in them.

1255
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,190
Daisuke will be fine.

1256
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,870
Mommy and daddy have him covered.

1257
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,470
So there's that at least.

1258
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,710
But you?

1259
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:13,390
Headed for bigger and better, right?

1260
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:17,330
Oh my god, it's not my fault that the company is shutting down!

1261
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:18,050
Chill!

1262
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:24,770
I'm just...

1263
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,310
It's not like I got a promotion.

1264
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,350
I'm getting fired, too.

1265
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:33,970
I'm just working on my life being a place I don't have to freaking escape.

1266
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:36,290
That's what I was trying to tell you.

1267
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:36,850
Nothing more.

1268
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,910
We're the ones you're trying to escape.

1269
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:45,470
Leave the dirt behind now that your boots are clean.

1270
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,410
That's not what I meant.

1271
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:49,790
It is what you meant.

1272
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,850
You just couldn't frame it.

1273
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,470
to yourself in a way that kept you as the hero.

1274
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:58,850
A fan in the crew but remain the model captain.

1275
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,730
What am I supposed to do?

1276
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:09,950
Um...

1277
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:10,870
Oh!

1278
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:13,510
Let's have some freaking cake, hmm?

1279
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:17,150
Props to the Twilight Cruise of the Topar.

1280
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,430
Props to our captain and his new prospects.

1281
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,310
What?

1282
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:24,290
I don't understand why Jimmy's being this way.

1283
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:29,110
It's not like we are... I'm like a CEO or something.

1284
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,370
I don't get it.

1285
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,590
Uh...

1286
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,360
Uh...

1287
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,060
Nobody's talking to me.

1288
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,360
He must be fun at parties.

1289
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,380
Wait, this is literally it.

1290
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,280
Um...

1291
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,340
Oh, take the knife.

1292
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,240
Uh-oh.

1293
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,380
But this is before the crash, though.

1294
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:03,140
A large kitchen knife.

1295
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:06,640
Regulations say I should keep it locked up behind the scanner.

1296
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,060
Oh!

1297
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,200
Okay!

1298
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,100
Who's hungry?

1299
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,280
Where's some cake?

1300
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:13,720
Oh.

1301
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,720
This is a bizarre way to cut a cake.

1302
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,080
I'm sawing it like a tree.

1303
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,500
Oh, uh-oh.

1304
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,600
Three months after the crash.

1305
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:37,520
Who's talking?

1306
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,030
Someone's yelling.

1307
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,290
Check on Curly.

1308
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:45,130
Uh-oh.

1309
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:47,330
Did I escape?

1310
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:48,650
He's still asleep.

1311
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:54,530
Oh my gosh.

1312
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:55,790
Polly says.

1313
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,410
Are you working hard?

1314
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:05,010
We're hardly working.

1315
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,950
Hee-hee.

1316
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:10,170
Oh my gosh, there's mouthwash bottles everywhere.

1317
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:11,150
Oh!

1318
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:13,790
Oh my god, wait, the food!

1319
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:16,650
These rations have to last us a long time.

1320
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,170
We just need to have discipline.

1321
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,370
Uncertified hamster, thank you so much for the vibe.

1322
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:21,090
Good to thank you!

1323
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,790
It's a knife that bludgeoned the cake that hard.

1324
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:24,310
I'm right!

1325
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:27,450
Wait, it's broken.

1326
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:28,930
Oh my god, look.

1327
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,830
Oh, find Daisuke's employee card.

1328
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,900
Looks like his name is Daisy.

1329
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,760
Employee card, Daisuke.

1330
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:53,980
There's so many bottles oh my gosh they're literally everywhere even behind the plant why

1331
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:10,680

1332
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:15,690
Oh my gosh.

1333
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,370
Oh my gosh.

1334
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:20,430
Anybody?

1335
01:26:20,730 --> 01:26:22,250
Oh, I can't even make the cake.

1336
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:23,530
The thing is all foamed.

1337
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:26,490
And the suffering.

1338
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,970
Thank you so much for the dead gifted.

1339
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:29,230
Oh my goodness.

1340
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:29,550
Thank you.

1341
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:29,990
Thank you.

1342
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,940
Oh, this is... Oh, I didn't realize this was a bed.

1343
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,760
He keeps sleeping outside utility.

1344
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:43,980
Oh, okay.

1345
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:44,380
Okay.

1346
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,080
For some reason, I only saw the boss.

1347
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,720
I didn't see anything else.

1348
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,330
Are you making all that noise?

1349
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,010
Oh, oh gosh, this is so horrible.

1350
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:04,450
Just become a ghost like me.

1351
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:08,570
I don't know if he's been given his medicine yet.

1352
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:10,470
Find Anya.

1353
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:14,990
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1354
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:19,590
Just a handful left.

1355
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:22,430
Once these are out, we'll have nothing to keep him quiet.

1356
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:23,710
Keep him quiet.

1357
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,920
Oh, my gosh.

1358
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:37,220
Anya!

1359
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,160
Anya!

1360
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:40,580
Give him the peels?

1361
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,720
But we have to find Anya first.

1362
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,280
Oh, my God.

1363
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:45,400
He's just, like, crying.

1364
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,140
You can hear him throughout the whole ship.

1365
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:52,380
god it's like a haunting like

1366
01:27:55,570 --> 01:28:17,830
you hear him in the vents oh my god oh my god the soul good thing we have so many more bottles we'll never go we'll never we'll never go hungry

1367
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:30,800
ania ania I'm scared Wait, uh, maybe utility?

1368
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,560
Swansea hasn't let anyone since the crash.

1369
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:34,920
It says it's filled with foam.

1370
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,000
Maybe the cockpit?

1371
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,900
There's only so many rooms you can go in.

1372
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,560
Oh my god, oh, you can...

1373
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:46,860
Oh, okay.

1374
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,660
Hello!

1375
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:51,160
No, I understand completely.

1376
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,820
If that's how it has to be.

1377
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:53,420
Oh!

1378
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,180
Oh, it's you.

1379
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,320
Jimmy, not able to sleep either.

1380
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,120
It's night time.

1381
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,400
Why are you talking this late?

1382
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,380
Anya, are you crying?

1383
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,160
No, don't worry.

1384
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,000
I'm okay.

1385
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,960
We all need to keep it together.

1386
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,520
Oh, I'm keeping it together.

1387
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,180
Don't you worry, Captain.

1388
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,060
He's making noises again.

1389
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,200
meds before, Anya?

1390
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:28,760
Uh, no.

1391
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,820
It must have slipped my mind.

1392
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,000
I'm sorry, I'll...

1393
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,700
I'll do it.

1394
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:34,440
No, really.

1395
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,380
I'm perfectly okay.

1396
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,040
I said I'll do it.

1397
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,720
Give Curly painkillers.

1398
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:41,460
Okay.

1399
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:50,910
Well, if I take this rope, that means Curly owes us 50 bucks.

1400
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:53,110
Right?

1401
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,260
That was their bet, no?

1402
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:25,930
okay let's go this way I don't know which way is fastest oh my god I just don't want to hear him anymore it's so oh it's so horrible how could you sleep through this

01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:51,430

Come on, stop with the noise.

1407
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:15,960
Okay, can you blame him?

1408
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:17,860
Damn it.

1409
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,920
I know what everyone is thinking.

1410
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,720
The way they look at me.

1411
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:22,540
Wait, what?

1412
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,960
What could I even say?

1413
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:26,640
And then...

1414
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,180
Okay, what would she do?

1415
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:28,820
Alright, Jimmy.

1416
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,160
Give the poor man his meds, please.

1417
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:32,780
Damn it!

1418
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,180
Here we are now.

1419
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,680
Me and the driver's seat.

1420
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,240
Thanks for that.

1421
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:38,500
Open up.

1422
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,580
I hope these make you feel free.

1423
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:54,390
You know,

1424
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:05,110
I struggle taking pills too.

1425
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,870
Do I just need to get punched in the stomach for it to work?

1426
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:15,360
Dang, those meds work fast.

1427
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:19,780
Why?

1428
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:21,980
Why did you beat him up, Jimmy?

1429
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,180
Oh my gosh.

1430
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,540
No one saw that, right?

1431
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,040
We're the worst!

1432
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:40,280
He feels everything probably like 50 times more because he's just muscle!

1433
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,200
He has no skin!

1434
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,800
Actually, if this happens to someone, they can't grow the skin back, right?

1435
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:50,340
Jimmy deserves a slap.

1436
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,340
Like...

1437
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,210
Why are humans so inefficient?

1438
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:02,630
They can't grow their skin back.

1439
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:04,830
They need skin grafts.

1440
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:06,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1441
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:09,870
You'd think after three months, at least a little skin would grow.

1442
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,590
You'd think he would, like, scab over, right?

1443
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,240
Yeah, he should be one big scab now.

1444
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:21,420
Probably.

1445
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,720
Gotta use the secret family technique of wrapping the pill in cheese.

1446
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:40,460
Yes, the ancient technique passed down from generation to generation.

1447
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,120
All right, bye, Curly.

1448
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,920
Oh, just kidding.

1449
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,220
Why doesn't Curly grow his skin back?

1450
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:50,940
Is he lazy?

1451
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,920
Oh, take what?

1452
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,920
Oh, it's my thumbnail.

1453
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,220
Curly, you're up.

1454
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,460
Oh, everything is...

1455
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,000
Mouth?

1456
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,700
I was going to say everything is foamed, but no, everything is mouthed.

1457
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,880
Mouthwash!

1458
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,520
Polly.

1459
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,460
Everything is mouthwash!

1460
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,000
Oh, take responsibility.

1461
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,800
Is that what it said?

1462
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:18,940
I couldn't read it.

1463
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:20,960
Oh.

1464
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:21,540
Oh.

1465
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,060
Why is it just curly?

1466
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,220
We should have some.

1467
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,160
Why?

1468
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,660
It's mediocre at best, obviously.

1469
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,440
Jimmy is such a...

1470
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:43,140
Downer.

1471
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:48,560
This game is a great object lesson and when you should stop projecting yourself on a protagonist.

1472
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,560
That's so true!

1473
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:57,610
Sometimes you can only get the subpar stuff.

1474
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:03,970
That's what makes the really good stuff, well, good.

1475
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:05,130
Right?

1476
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,610
Why bother?

1477
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:08,930
Hey.

1478
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:11,510
We all tried to escape.

1479
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:14,910
Just borrow Jimmy's skin suit.

1480
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:18,070
This is what VTubers look like when they take off their skin suits.

1481
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:21,690
Like, you know how Doki has skin suits?

1482
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:23,470
This is what she looks like underneath.

1483
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:27,290
Didn't work for any of us.

1484
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:31,230
I've thought many times, is this what peace feels like?

1485
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:33,310
Is it good enough?

1486
01:35:34,690 --> 01:35:36,970
Oh, these like cinematic angles.

1487
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:39,610
If I'm being real, it certainly isn't the best.

1488
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:46,390
So all I can do is try and make my life one I'm not trying to run from all the time.

1489
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:58,750
Sometimes I'll be promoted, buy a house, fall in love, but other times, I'll just have some awful freaking cake with my friend.

1490
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:00,430
Curly's a tomato?

1491
01:36:01,570 --> 01:36:02,310
I mean, look at it.

1492
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,710
Right now, that sounds pretty brilliant, yeah?

1493
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:08,530
So if you'll do the honors?

1494
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,810
Right.

1495
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:12,930
Well, let me go find a knife.

1496
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:36,130
Find a knife why is it why is it red why is it red so spooky find a knife where i walked around i didn't see one oh maybe they're here oh oh i

1497
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:47,850
can't see barely anything i feel like i'm gonna get jump scared by a horse where are we going

1498
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,060
It's so dark, yeah.

1499
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,520
I can't see anything.

1500
01:36:55,660 --> 01:36:56,300
Oh, wait.

1501
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:57,720
What?

1502
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:58,600
Is that a body?

1503
01:36:59,400 --> 01:36:59,960
No, okay.

1504
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,160
It's mouthwash.

1505
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,240
This part's kind of spooky.

1506
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:08,980
In the cockpit?

1507
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,740
Oh, that's right.

1508
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:13,120
It said it's with the stuff, right?

1509
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:18,340
That the knife was supposed to be locked up in the cockpit.

1510
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:21,160
Oh!

1511
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:21,860
Oh!

1512
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:22,800
That's...

1513
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:27,720
Oh, um, oh, it won't, uh, it won't let me grab anything else.

1514
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,100
I think that's a little bit dramatic for a cake, no?

1515
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,160
Feast!

1516
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:39,530
Uh, bon appetit?

1517
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,060
Oh, what's happening?

1518
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:45,980
Oh, I'm scared.

1519
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,280
Wait, I'm lost?

1520
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,480
Wait, I can't say anything.

1521
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,860
Eh, I'll just keep running.

1522
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,280
Forward, uh, wait, where's the...

1523
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:53,860
Where's the door?

1524
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:55,700
Oh, here?

1525
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:56,680
Wait, eh?

1526
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,320
I can't move.

1527
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,620
Oh, there we go.

1528
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,160
It's so dark.

1529
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:01,780
Oh, my goodness.

1530
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:05,740
Why is the music?

1531
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:07,260
What's happening?

1532
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:10,500
I'm just going to keep running.

1533
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,680
I feel like I'm getting chased or something.

1534
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:27,290
Oh, oh, no, wait.

1535
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:30,150
We were joking about the jerky, Jimmy.

1536
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:31,290
Oh, Jimmy.

1537
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,610
Jimmy, it was just a...

1538
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,470
It was just a little joke, Jimmy!

1539
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:37,290
It was a playful!

1540
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,940
No, this isn't actually happening, right?

1541
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,540
No, no way.

1542
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,980
Oh, no, no, no!

1543
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:57,130
Okay, good.

1544
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,810
I didn't have to do anything.

1545
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,390
Okay, it was all in our head.

1546
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:04,250
It was all...

1547
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,970
Check on the crew, four months after the crash.

1548
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:08,810
Oh my god!

1549
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:09,330
Die scared!

1550
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,030
What's happening to you?

1551
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:15,150
man can't, he can't hold his mouth wash.

1552
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,330
Andrew, welcome to Babusha.

1553
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:18,190
Thank you.

1554
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:24,330
How many have you had?

1555
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:28,670
Those will kill you before before anything else.

1556
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:29,470
I know.

1557
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:32,190
My mom found this internship for me.

1558
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,390
Such a slacker, she said.

1559
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:35,830
I don't know.

1560
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:38,770
I just never knew what I wanted to be.

1561
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,350
Never was good at anything.

1562
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,170
Aww.

1563
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,870
He's just a kid.

1564
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:47,050
Total screw up.

1565
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:49,090
We're not done yet, Daisuke.

1566
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:52,010
I just hope she doesn't blame herself.

1567
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:52,750
Aww.

1568
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:56,870
Oh, he was so...

1569
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:58,610
Please, just take it.

1570
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,930
He was so optimistic months ago.

1571
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:03,350
I don't want to look at this stuff anymore.

1572
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,270
I'll take it for you, buddy.

1573
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:08,750
Aww.

1574
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:10,750
It's so sad.

1575
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:17,470
Oh, uh, this is a cockpit.

1576
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:18,550
Can we go into utility?

1577
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:19,390
No.

1578
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:22,410
It says it's filled with foam.

1579
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:23,610
I don't believe that.

1580
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:26,750
I don't believe that at all.

1581
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:28,630
Yeah, dice can become a streamer.

1582
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:32,150
It's what all people do who don't know what they want to do.

1583
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:35,570
Wait, did I miss a door?

1584
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:36,510
Oh, yeah, there we go.

1585
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:38,870
Anya?

1586
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:40,470
Miss Anya?

1587
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:45,410
Oh, he says...

1588
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:51,180
A kiss, you have to thank you for the gift.

1589
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,580
I didn't see, I didn't get to see who braided, but thank you so much.

1590
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,660
Thank you, thank you.

1591
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,700
Hello, welcome in, everybody.

1592
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,320
That was...

1593
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:03,980
Polly said...

1594
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:05,760
Polly said...

1595
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,260
Look at Swansea, go, baby.

1596
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:10,180
Okay, shut up, Polly.

1597
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,980
We don't need to know what you say all the time.

1598
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:18,600
Anya.

1599
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:19,400
Ah!

1600
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,960
Oh, it startled me.

1601
01:41:23,100 --> 01:42:23,880
sorry no worries you thinking about drinking that too honestly yeah it'd probably just make me feel sick wouldn't fix anything as much as I'd like it to right hey I was thinking lucky thank you for the gifted did you know that not all the medicine aboard was in my office we store some in a storage locker in the hallway why haven't you brought this up earlier it was foamed up I didn't think it was possible to reach it but I've been estimating the position of the foam I think the medicine depot locker isn't too far into the mass of it so we could try to break it down one strike too many on a weak spot well I'll get sucked into space I mean is that so much worse than the situation you're in now Is anyone even coming to get you guys?

1602
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:26,080
I think it's worth the risk.

1603
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:31,080
If nothing else, it's an excuse to get Swansea to hand over the axe.

1604
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,780
Break the foam.

1605
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,920
Oh, that's what he's holding.

1606
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:38,020
I thought it was a cane.

1607
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,300
Oh my gosh.

1608
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,700
Oh no, this is real.

1609
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,060
Oh my gosh.

1610
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,100
Hey, Swansea.

1611
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,960
Hey there, buddy.

1612
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:57,100
He's doing the...

1613
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,300
The robot.

1614
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:02,140
Jumbo.

1615
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,180
El Capitano.

1616
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:06,920
The man with the plan.

1617
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,260
You done?

1618
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:09,440
I need that.

1619
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:10,860
This old thing?

1620
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:15,800
This was entrusted to me by our previous, tragically inclined leader.

1621
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,520
Best...

1622
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:17,980

Resp...

1627

01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:40,540
Ha!

1634
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,040

01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,620
He's just taken a little...

1637
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:48,020
He's been partying.

1638
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,720
Way too hardy.

1639
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:50,680

Where's the phone?

1649
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:06,740
Where's that phone?

1650
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,300
Anya, where's the phone?

1651
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,460
See the phone by the hallway to medical?

1652
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,100

01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:15,880

01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,740
He's all thumbed out.

1656
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,880
Don't say that.

1657
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,920
Not this one.

1658
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:25,680
Uh...

1659
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,440
Oh my gosh, we have no more meds.

1660
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:32,420
That's for you, Curly.

How you doing, buddy?

Oh, sorry.

1663
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,760
He's like Pavlovd in the open in his mouth once he sees me.

1664
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,080
I guess let me get the axe out.

1665
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,320
Can I use this thing here?

1666
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:48,240

Ha, yeah!

1673
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:01,900
Heya!

1674
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:02,560
Oops.

1675
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:08,240
What's...

1676
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,000
Take the painkillers!

1677
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,000
Isopropyl alcohol!

1678
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:15,140
McMac, thank you so much for the vibe, gifted.

1679
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,620
We're gonna go give it to him.

1680
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,060
I'll go tell Anya.

1681
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:22,200
Just kidding.

1682
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:25,160
Uh.

1683
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:25,700
Oh!

1684
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,620
Oh my gosh.

1685
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:27,600
She's a ghost.

1686
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,660
Oh, wow, Jim.

1687
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,040
You did it.

1688
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:34,040
Yeah.

1689
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:35,600
It actually wasn't that hard once.

1690
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:35,880
I figured...

1691
01:46:35,900 --> 01:47:07,480

1692
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:08,220
huh?

1693
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,960
I'm getting us through this.

1694
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:12,920
I...

1695
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:13,960
Wait, what did it say?

1696
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,160
It's find the code scanner.

1697
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,360
Then figure out the door code.

1698
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:21,340
Get the axe.

1699
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:24,760
Oh, chop up the foam, but not too much.

1700
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,880
Yeah, I said take responsibility.

1701
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:28,820
If so, Ava.

1702
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:33,920
And best of all, give Curly his freaking medicine.

1703
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:37,580
I have to.

1704
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:43,880
Because the captain has to take the freaking responsibility on this goddamn ship!

1705
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:46,820
Freaking.

1706
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:48,180
I'm sorry.

1707
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:49,820
I didn't mean to.

1708
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:53,700
Go make sure Daisuke doesn't choke on his own vomit.

1709
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:55,600
No, no, I can't.

1710
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,060
I'll take care of it, Anya.

1711
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,380
Oh, now you're gonna be nice about it.

1712
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,340
Freaking, freak.

1713
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,720
Your actions have consequences.

1714
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:05,880
I always do.

1715
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:19,690
Bottoms up, curly.

1716
01:48:20,970 --> 01:48:22,930
He's already opening wide.

1717
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:30,580
No, we're going to give the painkillers.

1718
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,420
Wait, what?

1719
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,700
Oh my god, wait.

1720
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,880
We're going to give him the painkillers.

1721
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,840
We have three.

1722
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,180
That's mad.

1723
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:54,380
I was wondering what the isopropyl alcohol is for.

1724
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,660
No, that's messed up.

1725
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,860
But what would Jimmy do?

1726
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:20,850
Okay, I'll give him medicine.

1727
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:26,170
I don't think I understood the pressure you were under before.

1728
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:28,930
And you tried to tell me.

1729
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:32,950
Our worst moments don't make us monsters, huh?

1730
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:35,830
You were a good captain, Curly.

1731
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:37,450
And you'll be one again.

1732
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:39,850
I'll get us both through this.

1733
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:41,550
Jimmy Redemption Arc?

1734
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:43,590
He just yelled at Anya.

1735
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:56,970
Jimmy would give the alcohol this one, see?

1736
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,590
Who's crying?

1737
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:07,170
Curly, don't cry.

1738
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,790
What is Curly?

1739
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:12,710
What could he even be thinking at this moment?

1740
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:13,150
You know?

1741
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:16,790
The redemption ship is long sailed.

1742
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,490
I agree.

1743
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,370
Oh.

1744
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:25,240
Six hours until judgment?

1745
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,660
Wait, what is...

1746
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,280
Jimmy, get the fuck out here!

1747
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:32,300
Wait, what's happening?

1748
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:38,690
What's going on?

1749
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:40,470
Uh...

1750
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:41,330
What's this?

1751
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:44,030
The rope?

1752
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,890
Take the rope?

1753
01:50:45,450 --> 01:50:46,590
You can't hide!

1754
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,930
Uh...

1755
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:49,910
Take the metal pipe?

1756
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:52,630
I'm gonna chop you into 20 fucking faces!

1757
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:55,890
Uh...

1758
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:57,850
Uh...

1759
01:50:57,850 --> 01:50:59,590
Where do I...

1760
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:02,730
Part of a metal pipe that broke off in the crash.

1761
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:05,150
Still strong enough to be repurposed.

1762
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:05,850
Wait, what is this?

1763
01:51:06,230 --> 01:51:07,690
My hands won't stop shaking.

1764
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:08,890
What is that?

1765
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:12,270
It's like...

1766
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:13,690
What is...

1767
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:17,890
A length of strong nylon rope I could use this?

1768
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:19,350
For what?

1769
01:51:20,110 --> 01:51:22,110
What exactly are we using it for?

1770
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:26,450
The metal pipe?

1771
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:39,310
Huh?

1772
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:41,950
Two days before the crash.

1773
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:42,630
What?

1774
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:45,630
What is my judgment?

1775
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:47,890
What is happening?

1776
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:49,410
Not my judgment.

1777
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:50,630
Jimmy's judgment.

1778
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:54,650
You doing okay?

1779
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:56,430
Said Curly.

1780
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:58,330
Yeah, can't sleep.

1781
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:00,810
I know how that is.

1782
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:02,110
I just toss and turn.

1783
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:05,190
Wow, it's so cute that it makes like a night sky and everything.

1784
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:07,190
Or stare at the ceiling all night.

1785
01:52:09,410 --> 01:53:21,320
actually kind of like the nighttime window screen if you can believe it so I just come look at it sometimes if you could look really really close you can see there's a dead pixel in the upper right corner that's called a star on you that's so nope don't see it in the back of my mind it's always there now I'll go bonkers looking for it cheers I don't think it ruins the illusion though it's peaceful but maybe I'm just used to looking at the bigger picture how many days of transport do we have left let's see off the top of my head around two hundred and thirty seven days that's right said that at the beginning huh just under eight months hey why do you think pony Express put a lock on the medical room door but not in the sleeping

1786
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:32,080
quarters hmm I suppose it's for the same reason they put a lock on the cockpit

1787
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:40,020
but doesn't everyone sleep in the sleeping quarters right

1788
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:49,010
yeah I feel like lock on that people can't just take the medicine and stuff.

1789
01:53:52,070 --> 01:53:53,130
They have their own rooms.

1790
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:04,640
Hey!

1791
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,200
Safety.

1792
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:06,500
Oh, safety.

1793
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:12,220
Just remember how to get the Neverland first 10 pixel to the right.

1794
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:13,540
Straight on till morning.

1795
01:54:19,930 --> 01:54:20,350
Ah.

1796
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:23,490
Five months after the crash.

1797
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:25,170
Oh.

1798
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,610
Oh.

1799
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:32,190
Wait.

1800
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:35,090
Jimmy, help!

1801
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:36,410
Oh?

1802
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:37,150
What's wrong?

1803
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:42,350
Jimmy, it's a total emergency!

1804
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:43,990
Calm down, what is it?

1805
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:45,890
Anya is stuck in medical.

1806
01:54:46,030 --> 01:54:46,870
The door won't open.

1807
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:49,870
What if she runs out of something?

1808
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:51,430
Right.

1809
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:52,830
Let's go have a look.

1810
01:54:53,070 --> 01:54:54,190
Wait, what do you mean something?

1811
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:00,840
Anya?

1812
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,440
Anya?

1813
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:09,360
What do you got?

1814
01:55:11,580 --> 01:55:12,380
M-Mikan.

1815
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:20,370
Yes.

1816
01:55:25,530 --> 01:55:27,130
Hey, heard the locks broken.

1817
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:29,770
Hey, Anya!

1818
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:31,010
Can you hear me?

1819
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:33,050
Yeah, I can hear you, Jimmy.

1820
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:36,110
The rest of our medicine stash is in there too.

1821
01:55:36,810 --> 01:55:37,810
Damn, this could be bad.

1822
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:39,830
Did you try to really...

1823
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:41,650
Did you try to really put your...

1824
01:55:41,670 --> 01:55:42,450
back into it?

1825
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:45,250
Any wrenches lying around?

1826
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:46,810
How heavy is the med kit?

1827
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:52,250
What if she is not locked in there?

1828
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:54,450
What if she locked you guys out?

1829
01:56:02,410 --> 01:56:03,610
Anya, is the door stuck?

1830
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:05,970
No.

1831
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:07,130
Huh?

1832
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,170
What do you mean?

1833
01:56:08,810 --> 01:56:12,870
Look, we're all stressed, but you can't go breaking down at every little hardship.

1834
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:13,290
Okay.

1835
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:16,010
Open the damn door.

1836
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:17,310
You were right.

1837
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:19,270
You were right all along.

1838
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:21,230
I should have done this from the beginning.

1839
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:22,950
Oh no.

1840
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:26,330
I always believed that our worst moments didn't define us.

1841
01:56:26,590 --> 01:56:27,890
Didn't make us be on repair.

1842
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:29,730
You think I wanted this either?

1843
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:32,610
Make no mistake, this isn't my worst moment.

1844
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:34,330
Far from it.

1845
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:36,830
It's the best decision I'll ever make.

1846
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:37,970
Open the door.

1847
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:39,590
I'll take care of it.

1848
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:40,710
Anya!

1849
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:41,190
Anya!

1850
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:42,870
What does that mean?

1851
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:45,790
Curly is still in there with her, right?

1852
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:47,270
Yeah.

1853
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:48,710
You don't think?

1854
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:49,630
Dyskate.

1855
01:56:50,230 --> 01:56:53,010
You and Swansea know the internals of the ship better than anyone.

1856
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:55,230
There's absolutely no other way into medical.

1857
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:59,030
Uh, well, Swansea said it was strictly off-limits.

1858
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:02,350
Like super mega not allowed above all else.

1859
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:03,970
The utility room.

1860
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:06,830
That busted vent in there loops into medical.

1861
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:10,190
But I mean, technically a person could totally fit through it.

1862
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:12,930
If that's the only way, we'll make it work.

1863
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:15,650
You listening on ya?

1864
01:57:16,730 --> 01:57:17,270
Five.

1865
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:18,410
Come on, dice game.

1866
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:20,910
Oh, no, oh, no, no.

1867
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:22,950
Wait, but that's...

1868
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:25,370
Oh, oh, no.

1869
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:26,290
Oh, no.

1870
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:27,290
Um.

1871
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:30,230
Uh-oh.

1872
01:57:30,730 --> 01:57:33,130
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1873
01:57:33,790 --> 01:57:36,030
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1874
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,260
Just want to look in here real quick.

1875
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:42,860
It's kind of crazy.

1876
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:45,680
That this is all mouthwash.

1877
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,680
That's kind of insane.

1878
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:52,940
Actually...

1879
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:55,080
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1880
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:55,740
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1881
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:56,940
Gosh, man.

1882
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:57,480
Oh, man.

1883
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:58,660
I don't like this at all.

1884
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:00,340
What could Anya be thinking?

1885
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:01,880
We should go check out utility, right?

1886
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:02,620
Yeah.

1887
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,680
Yeah, where is Swansea?

1888
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:08,640
Oh, speak at the devil.

1889
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:09,900
Hello, Master.

1890
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,260
Swansea, we need your help.

1891
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,800
I know you said utility was dangerous, but I...

1892
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,200
I'm good right here, fellas.

1893
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:21,640
You know, I'm not letting you in there.

1894
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,300
Off limits.

1895
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,680
Look, if there's any possibility, Jimbo.

1896
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:30,440
He looks so bad.

1897
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:32,460
He looks even more like a thumb than before.

1898
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:36,460
Letting you scratch off that foam wall would be useless.

1899
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,980
You'd only tear this goddamn ship a new asshole.

1900
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,060
Nothing to be done about it.

1901
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:42,940
Bad luck.

1902
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:45,200
Tail missed the donkey.

1903
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:45,740
What?

1904
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:47,620
Huh?

1905
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,280
I've never heard that phrase before.

1906
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:49,540
for.

1907
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,460
But Swansea, this could be really bad.

1908
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:53,820
Just hear us out.

1909
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:58,380
We're God's hand-picked favorites on this here planet, I reckon.

1910
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,820
Pin the tail on the donkey.

1911
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,700
Oh!

1912
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:08,980
Yes, yes, yes.

1913
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,220
Means we get to name it.

1914
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:14,980
So let's hear it for Wake Rock.

1915
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:18,060
Whatever's going on anywhere else ain't my problem.

1916
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:21,400
Since I'm the happiest man Wake Rock has ever seen.

1917
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:25,000
Oh my god, these voices are starting to kill my throat, though, guys.

1918
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:26,360
I'm taking a...

1919
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:28,640
I'm just gonna speak normal for a bit.

1920
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:30,620
I can't...

1921
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:32,380
I can't be a man.

1922
01:59:38,210 --> 01:59:39,290
Let's just go, Daisuke.

1923
01:59:40,010 --> 01:59:41,190
There's no point with him.

1924
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:44,190
Oh, just kidding.

1925
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:48,210
The jumps are getting, like, more and more sporadic.

1926
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:49,430
Whoa, what is this?

1927
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:51,570
Eight hours until judgment.

1928
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:55,730
Don't do anything.

1929
01:59:56,450 --> 01:59:56,810
Stop, stop.

1930
01:59:57,790 --> 01:59:58,690
I can fix this.

1931
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:01,870
Why do you keep fucking saying that?

1932
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:03,530
Are you hearing yourself?

1933
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:06,810
Wait, what happened?

1934
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:07,370
Daisuke!

1935
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:09,930
I'm so sorry.

1936
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:12,990
Oh, he didn't say he's so sorry.

1937
02:00:13,130 --> 02:00:13,670
He's just sorry.

1938
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:16,830
We still have disinfectant.

1939
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:19,030
Oh, I said I was going to stop, but I kept doing it.

1940
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:20,450
We still have disinfectant, right?

1941
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:22,710
The one from the extra medical stash?

1942
02:00:23,450 --> 02:00:23,830
Get it.

1943
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:24,270
Now!

1944
02:00:25,630 --> 02:00:26,430
Oh, yeah, I did it.

1945
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:54,610
use it the cocktail we you the cocktail what are you blabbering about what was your fault you would never have I had no choice wait what you useless you goddamn fucking idiot there has to be something else wait he made what did he make like a drink or something?

1946
02:00:57,770 --> 02:00:59,370
Buying disinfectant.

1947
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:08,150
Uh, oh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, mouthwash?

1948
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:09,070
Uh.

1949
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:17,470
You'll be okay.

1950
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:19,070
You'll be okay, you'll be okay, daiski!

1951
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:20,310
Uh.

1952
02:01:21,950 --> 02:01:22,970
Let's go back.

1953
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:28,350
There's nothing else in here, right?

1954
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:29,310
No, okay.

1955
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:33,350
Something in medical?

1956
02:01:33,650 --> 02:01:34,270
Oh, we could...

1957
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:34,790
Whoa.

1958
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:35,890
Whoa!

1959
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:41,740
What?

1960
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,280
I'm already looking in here.

1961
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,120
At least try to make yourself useful.

1962
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:48,540
God damn it!

1963
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:49,440
Oh, geez.

1964
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,080
Okay, sorry.

1965
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:50,800
My bad.

1966
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:52,720
Whoa!

1967
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:01,370
Something.

1968
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:02,690
All the lights are out, too.

1969
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:08,310
Like, it looks like just...

1970
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:12,030
Emergency lights are on?

1971
02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:13,130
What the?

1972
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:14,250
Who?

1973
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:15,710
What does that say?

1974
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:19,630
SD?

1975
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:21,710
Oh, wait.

1976
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:23,230
Oh.

1977
02:02:23,750 --> 02:02:24,350
I'm stupid.

1978
02:02:26,270 --> 02:02:26,450
Whoa.

1979
02:02:27,930 --> 02:02:28,450
Whoa.

1980
02:02:43,170 --> 02:02:45,030
We're in a bit of a hurry, so let's run.

1981
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:48,390
Wait, what do you mean?

1982
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:49,390
here we go.

1983
02:02:50,350 --> 02:02:50,850
What do you guys mean?

1984
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:51,530
What's happening?

1985
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:52,370
Oh!

1986
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:54,350
Take responsibility.

1987
02:02:55,990 --> 02:02:56,070
Oh.

1988
02:02:59,490 --> 02:02:59,830
Okay.

1989
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:00,970
Ooh.

1990
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:03,070
There's a lot of blood.

1991
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:03,690
Okay.

1992
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:04,750
Whoa.

1993
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:05,330
Whoa.

1994
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:06,250
Okay.

1995
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:11,010
Uh.

1996
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:23,310
Did that just say Polly says?

1997
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:28,170
Okay.

1998
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:31,230
Polly.

1999
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:41,890
he says is this spelling something out on the stairs i can't tell be quiet is that what it just said

2000
02:03:45,070 --> 02:03:46,110

2001
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:05,320

2002
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:14,150
i can't oh my gosh wait is there actually a poly monster

2003
02:04:18,110 --> 02:04:20,150
i want to know what this notepad says

2004
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:27,000
Oh my god.

2005
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:30,660
A blind beast, aimless and restless.

2006
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,720
You can't run from it.

2007
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:34,420
Okay.

2008
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,140
I can't even tell where it's from.

2009
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:40,600
Where it's at.

2010
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:48,110
Okay, I'm just trucking along.

2011
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:55,540
If I walk, I make noise.

2012
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:00,560
Is that him or me?

2013
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:22,080
I can't tell that's me.

2014
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:25,720
Oh my god.

2015
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:29,580
What if I die?

2016
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:38,960
Ah!

2017
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:42,940
Stop with your heavy feet, Jimmy!

2018
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,580
Oh my god.

2019
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:48,840
Uh-oh.

2020
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:52,600
Uh-oh.

2021
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:53,760
Uh-oh.

2022
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:54,000
Oh.

2023
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:54,800
Oh.

2024
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:11,530
I didn't see anything, though.

2025
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:13,470
Can I only see it with the scanner?

2026
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:22,990
How the hell am I supposed to get out of here?

2027
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,970
I think he is right in front of me.

2028
02:06:43,250 --> 02:06:44,110
Oh my god.

2029
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:47,510
Oh my god.

2030
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:49,170
Oh my god.

2031
02:06:53,530 --> 02:06:55,230
There's so many sounds from everywhere.

2032
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:56,890
Okay, I'm going to try going.

2033
02:06:57,410 --> 02:06:59,670
Am I following, like, the blood or something?

2034
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:00,490
Oh!

2035
02:07:03,210 --> 02:07:04,270
Oh, that's it.

2036
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:07,210
Oh, there was something there.

2037
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:10,530
I'm going to try following the blood.

2038
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:12,410
Brandon, thank you so much for the...

2039
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:13,430
Thank you, thank you!

2040
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:26,850
If he comes close...

2041
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:38,880
Where is it?

2042
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:51,470
Wait, what is this?

2043
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:53,110
Can I not go this way?

2044
02:07:56,530 --> 02:08:13,990
if i don't look at it i can't see that there's no there's a wall there he is oh i think i saw his nostril oh this really is a wall no no way okay um

2045
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:28,650
oh my god can you kind of see him that's crazy wait oh maybe i should have zoomed in haunts If I walk, am I okay?

2046
02:08:29,030 --> 02:08:30,770
Or, like, because I'm still making a sound.

2047
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:31,990
I guess we'll find out.

2048
02:08:33,650 --> 02:08:34,920
I'm making a lot of noise, though.

2049
02:08:44,820 --> 02:08:46,340
I'm making so much noise.

2050
02:08:55,490 --> 02:08:56,030
I'm scared.

2051
02:08:58,810 --> 02:08:59,830
Where is he?

2052
02:09:00,570 --> 02:09:00,910
Where is he?

2053
02:09:11,730 --> 02:09:13,010
Oh, I think I died.

2054
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:21,150
Okay, so walking...

2055
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:24,510
Does alert him?

2056
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:28,930
My god!

2057
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:30,350
He's right there.

2058
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:30,910
Oh, gosh.

2059
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:32,390
Okay.

2060
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:33,490
Keep going.

2061
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:41,050
I don't know where he's gotta go.

2062
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:44,510
Seems kind of far.

2063
02:09:47,610 --> 02:09:48,930
Now he's closer.

2064
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:49,770
Okay.

2065
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:58,650
Peter, the horse is here.

2066
02:10:05,310 --> 02:10:06,610
That does not look like a way.

2067
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:08,150
But it looks like there...

2068
02:10:08,150 --> 02:10:09,470
What if there's, like, a secret down there?

2069
02:10:11,790 --> 02:10:12,810
Oh my god.

2070
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:13,730
Oh my god.

2071
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:14,710
Oh my god.

2072
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:26,100
There was no secret.

2073
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:32,070
Oh my gosh!

2074
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:45,770
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

2075
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,720
Okay, don't worry about it.

2076
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:07,130
You just gotta be careful about him getting too close and...

2077
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:11,010
I want to pet his horse nose.

2078
02:11:17,950 --> 02:11:18,370
I don't...

2079
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:22,350
I think I saw that, like, it dips down over there, so I don't feel like I go there.

2080
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:23,690
Hello?

2081
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:25,570
Hello?

2082
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:30,210
maybe this way

2083
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:52,710
seems kind of far okay he's close I wish the what's it called we're better on this the light so I could see it better

2084
02:11:56,480 --> 02:12:05,880
yes yes Polly says it's

2085
02:12:10,510 --> 02:12:15,890
pretty forgiving though hopefully it's not three strikes you're out you know Oh,

2086
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:26,260
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

2087
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,220
oh.

2088
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:37,820
Here's four.

2089
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:48,510
We did it!

2090
02:12:49,290 --> 02:12:50,430
Ah, okay.

2091
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:52,170
Mouthwash time!

2092
02:12:54,030 --> 02:12:56,410
Bad breath ain't nothing but a dream.

2093
02:12:57,110 --> 02:12:59,590
You're right, it's here, poor princess.

2094
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:03,710
I'm sorry.

2095
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:05,810
I messed up.

2096
02:13:06,930 --> 02:13:08,230
Don't try to talk.

2097
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:11,010
Drink this.

2098
02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:14,070
Goop, goop, goop, goop, goop, goop.

2099
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:18,450
Goop, goop.

2100
02:13:22,810 --> 02:13:25,110
Did we just dump it all over him?

2101
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:35,730
Oh my gosh, when everyone stops, starts dying, you can just, you can just start dumping mouthwash on them to make the corpses not smell so bad.

2102
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:41,380
I think the vent and utility connects to medical.

2103
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:44,060
But you heard what he said going in there now.

2104
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:45,500
It's too unstable.

2105
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,780
Trying to break the foam could risk the air seal.

2106
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:54,830
I just don't want to screw up again like I did before.

2107
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:57,630
You heard Anya.

2108
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:00,830
I wouldn't put it past her to do something extreme right now.

2109
02:14:02,050 --> 02:14:02,790
You want me, Daisuke?

2110
02:14:03,190 --> 02:14:04,370
We can save Curly, yeah?

2111
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:05,090
Oh, now?

2112
02:14:05,310 --> 02:14:05,850
Okay, Jimmy.

2113
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:07,030
Now you care about Curly?

2114
02:14:07,190 --> 02:14:07,450
Okay.

2115
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:08,130
Sure.

2116
02:14:09,970 --> 02:14:11,350
That's not how it works.

2117
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:14,590
Oh, the sugar, yeah.

2118
02:14:16,830 --> 02:14:17,710
That's right.

2119
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:19,370
Yeah.

2120
02:14:21,070 --> 02:14:23,490
I'm sorry, but we went through that whole area.

2121
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:26,130
There was only one bottle of mouthwash left.

2122
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:30,310
We went through all the boxes of mouthwash?

2123
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:35,410
Swansea won't help, so we'll figure it out ourselves.

2124
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:36,610
Right.

2125
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:37,310
All right.

2126
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:38,970
Yeah, we got this.

2127
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:42,850
But even before the foam, how do we even get the door to utility open?

2128
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:45,710
Swansea has been practically camping in front of us.

2129
02:14:45,730 --> 02:15:16,130
of the door and he has the key i have an idea give him more mouthwash you're going to have to trust me we need to knock him out you're gonna fight him oh no even he has his limits when it comes to booze oh wait i was right we're gonna give him the mouthwash we have to make him pass out simple safe like,

2130
02:15:17,470 --> 02:15:20,470
Jimmy, the alcohol poisoning is definitely a real thing.

2131
02:15:21,850 --> 02:15:24,850
I don't know if safe is the right word.

2132
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:30,430
He might not even realize we did anything after the fact.

2133
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:34,770
There's a recipe for a mocktail in the kitchen.

2134
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:38,930
So we did make the cocktail.

2135
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:44,710
We can follow the steps by using different ingredients to add kick to it.

2136
02:15:45,730 --> 02:15:46,570
Come on.

2137
02:15:47,070 --> 02:15:48,530
Knock out Swansea.

2138
02:15:51,730 --> 02:15:52,290
Okay.

2139
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:56,050
Wait.

2140
02:15:57,130 --> 02:15:57,970
It's this door right here.

2141
02:15:58,130 --> 02:15:58,470
My bad.

2142
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:01,310
No way.

2143
02:16:06,330 --> 02:16:08,170
How am I supposed to get these, though?

2144
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:09,850
Water.

2145
02:16:10,010 --> 02:16:10,290
Oh, wait.

2146
02:16:10,810 --> 02:16:11,370
Mouthwash.

2147
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:12,970
Isopropyl.

2148
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:16,130
What?

2149
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:16,770
What?

2150
02:16:16,770 --> 02:16:17,070
What?

2151
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:19,030
Aww.

2152
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:21,290
Is this it?

2153
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:23,350
We're out of sweetener.

2154
02:16:23,970 --> 02:16:24,650
Any ideas?

2155
02:16:25,730 --> 02:16:26,930
I, uh...

2156
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:31,170
I might have accidentally at some point mistakenly placed a few packets before.

2157
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:32,530
By accident?

2158
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:34,270
Right.

2159
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:37,910
You could take a look around my stuff, could be somewhere around there.

2160
02:16:38,470 --> 02:16:40,190
But also totally somewhere else.

2161
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:41,370
Who knows?

2162
02:16:41,730 --> 02:16:42,410
Anything's possible.

2163
02:16:42,750 --> 02:16:44,270
Crash sure jumbled everything up.

2164
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:46,190
Right.

2165
02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:51,950
I think we would have found it in the four months that we've been here.

2166
02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:52,510
No?

2167
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,240
I can't believe we're not getting...

2168
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:02,100
We're using our precious isopropyl alcohol for this?

2169
02:17:08,370 --> 02:17:08,890
Okay.

2170
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,890
Then it's drink, base, and sweetener.

2171
02:17:14,330 --> 02:17:16,830
The mouthwash has...

2172
02:17:16,830 --> 02:17:17,930
Sugar in it.

2173
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:19,030
Do we need sweetener?

2174
02:17:21,450 --> 02:17:22,270
Nice glass.

2175
02:17:22,330 --> 02:17:45,330
though oh we took that sweet sweetener but the drink base we don't have that oh oh sorry I'm stupid I for I always forget that the drink base or the base is like the thing we just make okay Vivi core thanks for the gift oh

2176
02:17:49,290 --> 02:18:02,730
ah take spiked cocktail this is messed up this is this is messed up who wrote these instructions oh no no

2177
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:26,230
that drink looks sick i could totally picture myself on a beach with a hot babe and a few of those then i drink too many and throw them up all over myself i thought he was gonna say throw them up all over them hot babes and never be able to drink them again good times let's just get this to swansy

2178
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:40,810
Ah, hot babes and good drinks.

2179
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:45,550
You've taken a teaching my intern now?

2180
02:18:46,050 --> 02:18:49,430
I personally try to educate based off of years of experience.

2181
02:18:50,110 --> 02:18:52,310
But that's just me, Captain.

2182
02:18:53,210 --> 02:18:55,890
He says that was such like...

2183
02:18:55,890 --> 02:18:56,710
Justane.

2184
02:18:57,170 --> 02:18:59,710
Mocktail spiked with isopropyl alcohol.

2185
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:01,310
Here for a good time.

2186
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:02,850
Not a long time.

2187
02:19:08,370 --> 02:19:09,610
What is that?

2188
02:19:13,430 --> 02:19:15,510
Wait, why does this feel like...

2189
02:19:15,510 --> 02:19:17,630
Why does this feel like the mystery of the druid?

2190
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:19,590
How again?

2191
02:19:23,190 --> 02:19:27,350
Why do I keep playing games where I'm spiking old men?

2192
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:33,870
Oh my god!

2193
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:39,650
Oh my god.

2194
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:42,030
Detective, we must eat the meat.

2195
02:19:42,390 --> 02:19:42,730
Wait!

2196
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:48,890
If we eat curly, this will just become the mystery of the druids.

2197
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:57,760
Look, we need to keep working together.

2198
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:03,700
If this is how I can get us through this without us being at each other's necks all the time, then...

2199
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:04,880
Yeah, yeah, give me here.

2200
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,840
Why are you continually a pupil without a mentor?

2201
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:43,120
we kind of freestyled the recipe yeah I can tell you had a hand in this monstrosity kid my apple snaps you ain't no mixologist sure as hell ain't no mechanic either you never should have come here who the heck even decided to let you board huh no matter how illegal corrupt or immoral with a bunch of sad sack adults and see what he learns,

2202
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:43,440
eh?

2203
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:45,740
Bootstraps and all that.

2204
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:47,220
What a load of horse shit.

2205
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:52,540
You think it's all going somewhere, but every failure leaves you a little more mangled than before.

2206
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:54,120
Older.

2207
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:54,780
Uglier.

2208
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:56,120
Meaner.

2209
02:20:58,080 --> 02:20:59,940
Smarter in a worse way.

2210
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:02,960
Wallowing doesn't suit you, Swansea.

2211
02:21:03,720 --> 02:21:06,380
I suppose you think we all should be acting like you.

2212
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,960
Our hardworking, esteemed captain.

2213
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:13,260
say take a load off before the sun finally sets on this party.

2214
02:21:15,460 --> 02:21:18,660
May we never go to hell, but always be on our way.

2215
02:21:20,660 --> 02:21:21,540
Hip-hip!

2216
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,320
Hooray!

2217
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,240
Oh my gosh, he's just chugging that.

2218
02:21:38,430 --> 02:21:41,310
Swansea's key for the utility room and never leaves this person.

2219
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:43,890
Look at the little... Oh, wait, that's so cute!

2220
02:21:44,050 --> 02:21:45,190
What does it say on it?

2221
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:50,310
Alright, hey, chill out, dude.

2222
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:50,950
Chill out.

2223
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:52,470
Is he still breathing?

2224
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:55,370
He practically bounced off the ground!

2225
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:57,490
It'll be fine.

2226
02:21:57,670 --> 02:21:59,670
His tolerance has to be through the roof by now.

2227
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:02,010
Probably just wake up with a massive headache.

2228
02:22:02,670 --> 02:22:05,270
Oh man, he's gonna be so, so mad!

2229
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:07,470
He'll never get a good reference now!

2230
02:22:07,730 --> 02:22:08,010
Ow!

2231
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:13,300
Daisuke.

2232
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,160
I don't know if we're getting out of this buddy.

2233
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:21,280
Wait, why not?

2234
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:21,460
Oh.

2235
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:24,380
Oh, there we go.

2236
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:24,900
Okay.

2237
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:32,290
Captain, you, uh, are you sure about this?

2238
02:22:32,830 --> 02:22:35,290
Maybe we could talk with Swansea when he's cleared up a bit later.

2239
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:39,270
He's just, like, really into workplace safety and stuff sometimes, you know?

2240
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:41,670
Which is, like, totally cool and stuff, I think.

2241
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:44,530
He taught me, it's time to be brave, Daisuke.

2242
02:22:45,250 --> 02:22:47,050
Curly and Anya are counting on us.

2243
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:49,970
Oh, gosh.

2244
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:51,210
Oh, gosh.

2245
02:22:52,770 --> 02:22:53,210
Wait.

2246
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:57,290
Whoa, it's, like, barely foamed up at all.

2247
02:22:58,730 --> 02:22:59,430
it's those things.

2248
02:22:59,750 --> 02:23:00,850
I've never been inside one.

2249
02:23:01,390 --> 02:23:02,030
What are they called again?

2250
02:23:04,270 --> 02:23:05,370
Cryostasis pods.

2251
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:07,950
Oh yeah, these things are far out.

2252
02:23:08,510 --> 02:23:09,490
Totally sci-fi.

2253
02:23:11,010 --> 02:23:12,430
Still a spare change for the payphone.

2254
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:15,210
Oh, it looks like this one still works.

2255
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:23,380
There's only one working cryostasis pod.

2256
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:29,730
How long can these things even keep you frozen?

2257
02:23:31,350 --> 02:23:32,390
20 years.

2258
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:38,650
I can't believe Swansea managed to clear all that foam from here.

2259
02:23:38,770 --> 02:23:39,910
I don't think it ever foamed up.

2260
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:40,970
He didn't.

2261
02:23:41,010 --> 02:23:41,770
Yeah, he lied.

2262
02:23:42,470 --> 02:23:45,650
I mean, I think, you know.

2263
02:23:46,450 --> 02:23:46,730
What?

2264
02:23:47,330 --> 02:23:48,230
Think about it.

2265
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:52,350
Swansea never let you work with him on breaking the utility room foam walled, right?

2266
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:55,930
No, it needed to be handled delicately.

2267
02:23:56,690 --> 02:23:58,710
He said I was way too much...

2268
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:01,610
I have way too much athletic strength in my arms.

2269
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:03,850
Through the foe.

2270
02:24:04,330 --> 02:24:06,690
I was like, damn, makes total sense.

2271
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:07,570
Bummer.

2272
02:24:10,790 --> 02:24:14,410
Anya keeping a skinless man alive for four months is a medical miracle.

2273
02:24:16,210 --> 02:24:16,590
Yeah.

2274
02:24:17,610 --> 02:24:21,150
With nothing but, but, like, pain reliever.

2275
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:25,850
So I've been in charge of the kitchen instead.

2276
02:24:26,330 --> 02:24:27,530
He said it's...

2277
02:24:27,530 --> 02:24:28,250
Oh, sorry.

2278
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:33,950
He said it's next level critical to keep stock and organize every day.

2279
02:24:35,050 --> 02:24:38,750
Had me double, triple, four, tuple, check everything, like all the time.

2280
02:24:39,890 --> 02:24:40,150
Right.

2281
02:24:41,830 --> 02:24:43,890
Of course, and he never told you he'd gotten in here?

2282
02:24:45,010 --> 02:24:46,850
No, but look how busy he must have been.

2283
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:53,090
There was never any foam here, and Swansea has known the whole damn time.

2284
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:57,630
Just taking a load off before the sun finally sets on this party, huh?

2285
02:24:58,590 --> 02:25:02,650
That boozed up bastard has been biding his time until he can save himself.

2286
02:25:03,550 --> 02:25:06,290
Would getting in the pod really mean you'd get rescued?

2287
02:25:07,410 --> 02:25:09,210
20 years more of a chance to get found.

2288
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:11,610
I'd take those odds over our current situation.

2289
02:25:12,330 --> 02:25:13,310
Not like this, though.

2290
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:18,670
Not by lying through my teeth while waiting for everyone else to die.

2291
02:25:20,210 --> 02:25:21,730
No, man, that just can't be right.

2292
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:23,330
I'm sure there's a reason.

2293
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:25,370
We'll ask him about it when he wakes up.

2294
02:25:26,010 --> 02:25:27,050
We'll deal with him after.

2295
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:28,970
Right now we have a job to finish.

2296
02:25:29,730 --> 02:25:31,670
And the vent looks like it's still in one piece.

2297
02:25:33,190 --> 02:25:34,210
Check out those sparks.

2298
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:34,690
Uh-oh.

2299
02:25:35,070 --> 02:25:37,330
I hate to imagine how gnarly it looks on the inside.

2300
02:25:37,890 --> 02:25:38,270
Gnarly.

2301
02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:41,090
Everything's gnarly.

2302
02:25:41,370 --> 02:25:43,070
Not, not, not, not, not gnarly.

2303
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:46,170
It could be somewhat collapsed in places.

2304
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:47,830
You could make it through.

2305
02:25:48,890 --> 02:25:49,890
We need to try it.

2306
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:50,810
Wait, wait, wait.

2307
02:25:51,750 --> 02:25:52,350
Wait, what?

2308
02:25:54,030 --> 02:25:55,730
Um, Swansea said it's not safe.

2309
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:58,450
Yeah, it looks even way less safe now, too.

2310
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:03,770
I know we forgot to tell us about the pod, but he knows, like, everything about this of stuff.

2311
02:26:04,450 --> 02:26:05,930
Maybe we should just wait for him to wake back up.

2312
02:26:06,190 --> 02:26:06,670
Poor Daisuke!

2313
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:07,910
This poor guy!

2314
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:13,280
You said you could handle it.

2315
02:26:13,580 --> 02:26:15,260
Why don't you go in then, Jimmy?

2316
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:17,260
Swansea taught you well, right?

2317
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:18,780
Time to prove it.

2318
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:20,920
He'll be impressed when he wakes up.

2319
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:21,740
Proud.

2320
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:27,160
He'll understand why we had to do this.

2321
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,100
Then he can explain himself.

2322
02:26:32,180 --> 02:26:32,860
You think so?

2323
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:33,880
Daisuke.

2324
02:26:34,660 --> 02:26:36,080
Everyone's counting on you.

2325
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,860
Oh my god, Jimmy!

2326
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:41,740
Captain's orders!

2327
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:46,980
Yeah, I got this.

2328
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:47,840
Okay.

2329
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:49,960
Here we go.

2330
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:53,500
Mutiny, mutiny, mutiny!

2331
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:56,600
Oh my god, Jimmy.

2332
02:26:57,620 --> 02:26:58,940
What are you doing, Jimmy?

2333
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:00,220
Jimmy!

2334
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:01,980
Daisuke!

2335
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:21,560
What's happening?

2336
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:22,580
What?

2337
02:27:25,210 --> 02:27:25,790
Anya?

2338
02:27:26,510 --> 02:27:28,550
What did you do?

2339
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:36,920
One day before the crash.

2340
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:41,230
Oh.

2341
02:27:41,710 --> 02:27:43,430
Find the gun!

2342
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:45,650
There's a gun on this ship?

2343
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:50,550
Uh, if I were a gun...

2344
02:27:50,550 --> 02:27:51,650
Where would I be?

2345
02:27:52,370 --> 02:27:54,430
Wait, why are we looking for a gun now?

2346
02:27:56,430 --> 02:27:57,110
team

2347
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:09,010
team everything's so clean wow remember oh wow I can't interact with anything anymore okay let's start running

2348
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,040
another day in paradise

2349
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:31,540
I already checked here okay let's go back to medical if we started there I imagine maybe it's in there

2350
02:28:35,620 --> 02:29:01,650
um like it uh uh oh is that a a box for a gun up there mighty suspicious it's still broken wait she couldn't have hit it in there oh ania ania has the gun uh okay

2351
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:10,270
Utility?

2352
02:29:11,430 --> 02:29:13,270
Let's see if anyone's down here.

2353
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:18,750
Where is everybody?

2354
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:20,310
Wait, what was the...

2355
02:29:20,310 --> 02:29:21,990
Oh, I can't even interact with it, though.

2356
02:29:22,990 --> 02:29:23,470
Because they...

2357
02:29:23,470 --> 02:29:24,170
What was the password?

2358
02:29:25,290 --> 02:29:25,730
Oh, wait.

2359
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:26,710
This goes circles.

2360
02:29:28,090 --> 02:29:28,190
Um...

2361
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:28,510
No?

2362
02:29:30,010 --> 02:29:30,530
Cockpit?

2363
02:29:31,410 --> 02:29:34,070
Is it in that, um...

2364
02:29:34,890 --> 02:29:35,770
What's it called?

2365
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:38,970
The storage locker that we've been getting stuff from?

2366
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:39,830
Oh!

2367
02:29:40,050 --> 02:29:40,410
Anya?

2368
02:29:43,390 --> 02:29:44,410
Where is it?

2369
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:49,230
Us being let go isn't a reason to hurt yourself.

2370
02:29:50,910 --> 02:29:53,850
Anya, as our nurse, you never got psyche vows.

2371
02:29:54,430 --> 02:29:55,370
I should have thought of that.

2372
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:59,230
You could have come to me if you were feeling stressed.

2373
02:30:00,210 --> 02:30:01,150
What would you have done?

2374
02:30:03,150 --> 02:30:03,590
Anything.

2375
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:04,030
Anything.

2376
02:30:04,970 --> 02:30:06,870
You, the crew, are all my responsibility.

2377
02:30:08,530 --> 02:30:10,030
I told you so over and over, yeah?

2378
02:30:12,190 --> 02:30:44,110
hurt myself you know the gun is in a safety case I can't open but I hid the case itself tell me where it is none of this has has to be on our performance log we'll figure it out together okay I don't think the performance log is what she's thinking of anymore I'm pregnant oh my gosh you're what who would you captain I told you.

2379
02:30:45,190 --> 02:30:45,610
Listen to me.

2380
02:30:46,230 --> 02:30:46,970
We can fix this.

2381
02:30:47,550 --> 02:30:49,090
I've known him for a long time.

2382
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:50,730
I'll talk to him!

2383
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:12,070
I know you'd never give me the gun to protect myself.

2384
02:31:12,990 --> 02:31:16,490
So the least I can do is make sure he never gets it either.

2385
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:19,130
She knows he's bad news bears.

2386
02:31:19,690 --> 02:31:20,970
Remember when she mentioned the locks?

2387
02:31:21,150 --> 02:31:21,470
Yeah!

2388
02:31:41,950 --> 02:31:45,490
A reading printed from the navigation computer.

2389
02:31:46,270 --> 02:31:46,710
Holy moly.

2390
02:31:47,230 --> 02:31:48,170
Holy moly indeed.

2391
02:31:49,970 --> 02:31:52,510
Detected abnormal asteroid trajectories along the route.

2392
02:31:53,050 --> 02:31:55,310
Course corrections might be required during transit.

2393
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:01,130
She hid it.

2394
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:07,100
Can we remove Jimmy's skin?

2395
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:09,940
And he, this guy is trying to act like he's...

2396
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:12,980
Oh, all like self-important and everything.

2397
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:16,000
Like, I'm the captain, I'm going to get us out of this.

2398
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,960
Six hours until judgment.

2399
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,120
The bleeding won't stop.

2400
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:25,360
Just try to stay still.

2401
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:26,400
Daisuke.

2402
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:30,680
About stop getting pregnant mid-fantom.

2403
02:32:32,860 --> 02:32:34,700
A big congratulations to Hal again.

2404
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:37,560
You are no longer the worst freaking guy.

2405
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:41,980
I need a second to think.

2406
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:42,860
We can fix this.

2407
02:32:43,820 --> 02:32:45,150
Hey, kid, do you hear me?

2408
02:32:48,860 --> 02:32:49,400
Daisuke?

2409
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:54,040
How did this happen, though?

2410
02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:56,080
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

2411
02:32:56,600 --> 02:32:57,140
Don't move.

2412
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:58,780
It's all right, Daisuke.

2413
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,100
Calm down.

2414
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:07,780
This line of work, you could never have become like miserable old swansy.

2415
02:33:08,720 --> 02:33:09,540
What a tragedy.

2416
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:15,640
Decades of hauling ass for Pony Express, big, mighty, Ruzer with all his shiny tools.

2417
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:18,500
This is where it got me.

2418
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:19,740
The good life, huh?

2419
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:21,660
Oh, Daisuke's just a kid.

2420
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:26,720
I thought you were dumber than a can of paint.

2421
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,360
Always just chewing my ear off about nothing.

2422
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,120
Useless ray of goddamn sunshine.

2423
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:34,420
Yeah, our little golden retriever boy.

2424
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:37,440
Not an A student.

2425
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:40,740
Career workhorse or force of ambition.

2426
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,660
Just a damn good kid trying his best.

2427
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:49,280
You could have taught an old fool like me a lot.

2428
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:54,420
Close your eyes, Daisuke.

2429
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:00,790
Cinema.

2430
02:34:01,250 --> 02:34:02,150
Oh, my God.

2431
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:15,440
Oh, Swansea.

2432
02:34:24,770 --> 02:34:27,170
Oh, shut up, Jimmy.

2433
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:30,730
You monster.

2434
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:33,550
Oh, my gosh.

2435
02:34:34,050 --> 02:34:42,410
Jimmy, Huey, oh, yeah, oh gosh, I'm getting like, oh, oh, what is, oh, my brain is mixing people up.

2436
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:43,350
What's happening?

2437
02:34:51,650 --> 02:34:54,690
Oh, I could have fixed him, Swansea.

2438
02:34:56,910 --> 02:34:59,750
Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy's just a real piece of work now, isn't he?

2439
02:35:00,310 --> 02:35:02,430
I have to do everything myself.

2440
02:35:03,050 --> 02:35:05,910
Why can't any of you just give me some time to think?

2441
02:35:09,270 --> 02:35:11,190
How do you still not understand?

2442
02:35:12,290 --> 02:35:14,090
You should be on this boat, Swansea.

2443
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:14,990
Right?

2444
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:21,910
It's over.

2445
02:35:23,270 --> 02:35:24,850
End of the fucking line.

2446
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:29,950
He won't suffer one more second because of your delusions.

2447
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:34,400
Unbelievable.

2448
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,700
Stop pretending.

2449
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:38,240
I know all about your plan, Swansea.

2450
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:39,820
I went to utility.

2451
02:35:40,920 --> 02:36:11,880
on this ship for real that's that pony do you know that swan parents will sometimes kill their young who are weak and sickly really wait that's so sad it's poetry this is somehow Huey's fault I saw what you've been hiding down there sneaking around with that axe telling Anya who knows what Now this,

2452
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:15,260
you're making sure you're the one who gets inside that cryopod.

2453
02:36:19,890 --> 02:36:21,490
I sure did talk to Anya.

2454
02:36:22,410 --> 02:36:24,290
Jimmy is such an idiot.

2455
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:31,090
Thinking that Swansea is thinking of putting himself in the cryopod.

2456
02:36:31,710 --> 02:36:33,990
This guy is so stupid.

2457
02:36:35,470 --> 02:36:38,510
But it was her telling me all sorts of things instead, wasn't it?

2458
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:45,940
Shouldn't a captain go down with his ship?

2459
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:48,540
Oh, yeah, you tell him, you tell him.

2460
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:52,970
Not that I'm...

2461
02:36:52,970 --> 02:36:54,470
I ain't got no place to be.

2462
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:57,570
I got everything I could ever want right here on this ship.

2463
02:36:58,450 --> 02:36:59,870
So go ahead and get in that pot.

2464
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:04,410
If you ever get found, you can tell them whatever fucking story you like.

2465
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:06,120
You've earned it.

2466
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:10,530
Oh, man.

2467
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:12,590
Oh, get the gun!

2468
02:37:13,010 --> 02:37:14,930
Wait, I don't know where it is.

2469
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:16,450
Oh, my God!

2470
02:37:17,810 --> 02:37:18,310
Okay!

2471
02:37:20,850 --> 02:37:21,770
Uh...

2472
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:23,450
Oh...

2473
02:37:23,450 --> 02:37:24,370
A gun.

2474
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:30,610
Maybe in medical?

2475
02:37:32,410 --> 02:37:32,690
Oh!

2476
02:37:33,550 --> 02:37:33,950
Wait!

2477
02:37:34,530 --> 02:37:35,670
Uh... Oh!

2478
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:38,960
Oh my god!

2479
02:37:48,710 --> 02:37:50,630
Even... We can't even...

2480
02:37:57,430 --> 02:37:58,890
What is this?

2481
02:38:01,710 --> 02:38:02,630
Oh.

2482
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:04,170
Oh!

2483
02:38:04,390 --> 02:38:05,190
Uh...

2484
02:38:05,190 --> 02:38:06,830
Is this... The gun?

2485
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:20,200
Uh, is it, um, what's it called?

2486
02:38:20,580 --> 02:38:22,140
Oh, wait, I can't, I'll just go this way.

2487
02:38:24,400 --> 02:38:25,300
It's just so dark.

2488
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:28,640
I have to use the scanner, right?

2489
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:34,860
Um, oh, wow!

2490
02:38:40,110 --> 02:38:41,530
Oh my god.

2491
02:38:42,790 --> 02:38:44,410
Oh my god.

2492
02:38:45,310 --> 02:38:46,730
I wonder where Swansea went.

2493
02:38:49,270 --> 02:38:50,930
Like, is he in utility now?

2494
02:38:54,130 --> 02:38:56,230
Actually, where could he be?

2495
02:38:58,990 --> 02:39:01,250
Is it actually surprising we could come in here?

2496
02:39:07,300 --> 02:39:07,860
8008.

2497
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:08,740
You're so right.

2498
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:12,840
Oh!

2499
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:15,060
Yeah, we could brute force it.

2500
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:15,920
We got time.

2501
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:17,760
I don't have time, actually.

2502
02:39:22,730 --> 02:39:23,950
This, right?

2503
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:24,970
Right?

2504
02:39:24,990 --> 02:39:27,230
739, okay.

2505
02:39:32,930 --> 02:39:34,890
It's so quiet.

2506
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:40,970
739, 739.

2507
02:39:56,590 --> 02:40:00,190
I can't see.

2508
02:40:00,690 --> 02:40:01,430
What can I see?

2509
02:40:02,630 --> 02:40:03,110
Okay.

2510
02:40:08,510 --> 02:40:10,530
Ah, he's not in here either.

2511
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:14,270
Jeez, Louise.

2512
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:16,170
Oh, my gosh.

2513
02:40:17,690 --> 02:40:18,950
Oh, my gosh.

2514
02:40:20,350 --> 02:40:21,550
Oh, my gosh.

2515
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:27,810
I could just hear him breathing while I'm doing this.

2516
02:40:28,290 --> 02:40:28,290
Oh,

2517
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:32,830
whoops.

2518
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:50,310
What's the joke I want to know?

2519
02:40:51,550 --> 02:40:53,350
I want to laugh, too, Curly.

2520
02:40:54,450 --> 02:40:55,790
What if we all just laugh?

2521
02:41:00,630 --> 02:41:02,370
Yeah, Jimmy's the joke here.

2522
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:05,330
Jimmy!

2523
02:41:06,030 --> 02:41:06,130
Oh!

2524
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:08,710
Is this our judgment?

2525
02:41:10,350 --> 02:41:11,010
Wait, what are we?

2526
02:41:11,150 --> 02:41:11,550
What are we?

2527
02:41:12,130 --> 02:41:13,690
Zero days before the crash.

2528
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:16,930
I was going to say, what could we be zooming to this time?

2529
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:23,970
I told him.

2530
02:41:24,630 --> 02:41:25,510
Anya, you...

2531
02:41:26,050 --> 02:41:27,390
You should have waited for me.

2532
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:28,810
Oh no, did she tell Jimmy?

2533
02:41:30,570 --> 02:41:31,610
What did he say?

2534
02:41:36,490 --> 02:41:38,110
Nothing that makes any difference.

2535
02:41:40,870 --> 02:41:41,930
Where did he go?

2536
02:41:42,790 --> 02:41:44,770
He just walked away.

2537
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:48,210
Curly.

2538
02:41:48,890 --> 02:41:50,210
I don't want him in here anymore.

2539
02:41:51,230 --> 02:41:51,450
Hold on.

2540
02:41:51,750 --> 02:41:53,330
I need to find him.

2541
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:54,630
Everything's going to be okay.

2542
02:41:55,850 --> 02:41:56,290
Oh, God.

2543
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:05,980
What's that sound?

2544
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:10,680
I need to go to the cockpit.

2545
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:18,260
Uh, Jimmy.

2546
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:19,460
Jimmy, Jimmy.

2547
02:42:20,980 --> 02:42:21,420
Jimmy.

2548
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:24,260
Oh, gosh.

2549
02:42:24,460 --> 02:42:25,680
This feels so tense.

2550
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:27,380
Well, there he is.

2551
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:28,140
He's just chilling.

2552
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:31,820
Jim, I can fix this.

2553
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:34,620
What do you think will happen when we get back?

2554
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:35,220
Hmm?

2555
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:37,200
We can figure all this out.

2556
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:38,540
You and me.

2557
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:44,320
All I ever hear is how great of a leader you are.

2558
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:47,240
God, it's so annoying.

2559
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:48,360
But now?

2560
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:51,860
What do you think will happen now when we get back?

2561
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:54,240
We'll fix this together.

2562
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:02,150
Everything you and I worked for in our lives.

2563
02:43:02,490 --> 02:43:03,050
Accomplishments.

2564
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:04,090
Changes.

2565
02:43:05,090 --> 02:43:05,990
None of it will matter.

2566
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:08,510
Why is Curly getting involved?

2567
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:10,350
What do you mean?

2568
02:43:11,550 --> 02:43:16,730
I guess because he's the captain and was supposed to, you know, be taking care of his...

2569
02:43:17,890 --> 02:43:19,090
Oh, gosh.

2570
02:43:19,530 --> 02:43:20,030
His people.

2571
02:43:21,090 --> 02:43:23,150
You've gotten through difficult situations before.

2572
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:26,110
won't be any different.

2573
02:43:26,790 --> 02:43:28,410
Work through it one day at a time.

2574
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:32,210
It's not just me, is it?

2575
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:35,470
You were supposed to be the one who had everything under control.

2576
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:37,390
You said so yourself.

2577
02:43:38,650 --> 02:43:44,430
Jimmy, I'm Jimmy, I'm sorry, but is Curly puppeteering you?

2578
02:43:44,610 --> 02:43:46,290
Does Curly make you do everything?

2579
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:51,910
Jimmy, you have your own actions!

2580
02:43:54,230 --> 02:44:02,090
The ship This crew, everything that happened here, this was your responsibility, Captain.

2581
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:05,890
Oh, Jenny!

2582
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:16,990
Oh, that is what you'll be hearing the rest of your life.

2583
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:22,070
Or this can all be remembered as a tragedy.

2584
02:44:22,770 --> 02:44:55,690
Despite what must have been the best efforts of its acclaimed captain, never found no one survived to tell the tale oh whoa that's that's curly whoa you're standing at the top feet and cement I get it now right curly with skin I prefer jerky curly right

2585
02:44:59,070 --> 02:45:05,070
wait so it was Jimmy's idea to to tank the ship?

2586
02:45:07,210 --> 02:45:08,930
Take care of it.

2587
02:45:13,770 --> 02:45:15,930
I'll take care of it.

2588
02:45:19,290 --> 02:45:19,490
Oh

2589
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:25,540
Wait, so Jimmy was the one who did it.

2590
02:45:26,180 --> 02:45:29,180
Oh my oh my god.

2591
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:36,740
Oh my god Ah Oh, wrong way Oh

2592
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:41,650
my gosh Ah

2593
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,020
Jimmy!

2594
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:54,020
Jim, tell me you didn't.

2595
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:56,600
Oh my god, Curly, you do what you...

2596
02:45:56,600 --> 02:45:57,660
I didn't...

2597
02:45:57,660 --> 02:45:58,500
What did you do?

2598
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:19,430
One hour before judgment.

2599
02:46:19,630 --> 02:46:20,230
Who is...

2600
02:46:20,230 --> 02:46:20,450
Wait.

2601
02:46:21,390 --> 02:46:23,110
What happened to...

2602
02:46:23,110 --> 02:46:24,750
What did they do to Anya?

2603
02:46:24,850 --> 02:46:26,390
Wait, with Anya's body also.

2604
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:27,630
Oh my gosh.

2605
02:46:27,710 --> 02:46:28,890
Wait, but where's Swansea?

2606
02:46:30,010 --> 02:46:30,250
Wait.

2607
02:46:35,290 --> 02:46:35,790
Birthday.

2608
02:46:37,370 --> 02:46:38,050
Oh no.

2609
02:46:38,590 --> 02:46:39,110
Oh no.

2610
02:46:40,010 --> 02:46:41,150
Oh, put you in the chair.

2611
02:46:41,350 --> 02:46:42,090
Oh, no.

2612
02:46:42,770 --> 02:46:43,310
Oh, no.

2613
02:46:51,270 --> 02:46:52,950
Happy birthday, Captain.

2614
02:46:53,670 --> 02:46:54,930
This rocks.

2615
02:46:55,890 --> 02:46:56,890
I'm here, here.

2616
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:02,430
To Captain Jimbo.

2617
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:03,390
Oh, no.

2618
02:47:04,330 --> 02:47:06,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2619
02:47:07,310 --> 02:47:08,270
Come on.

2620
02:47:08,410 --> 02:47:10,150
You have to give a speech.

2621
02:47:10,890 --> 02:47:11,370
Go on.

2622
02:47:11,490 --> 02:47:12,190
Have at it.

2623
02:47:13,210 --> 02:47:14,310
You better make it good.

2624
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:22,530
yeah our captain captain jimmy oh wow this is so dumb

2625
02:47:31,670 --> 02:47:54,660
um i'd like to dedicate i'd like to dedicate this meal to my trusted mentor detective haligan whom has taught me everything that i've ever known and that i take his teachings at very face value

2626
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:07,840
I accidentally touched the leave.

2627
02:48:08,220 --> 02:48:10,060
I accidentally opened the developer menu?

2628
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:12,140
My bad.

2629
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:12,520
Okay.

2630
02:48:13,140 --> 02:48:14,320
Get the job done.

2631
02:48:20,310 --> 02:48:23,770
I even got an achievement for opening the developer menu.

2632
02:48:23,910 --> 02:48:24,710
I don't know how I did that.

2633
02:48:24,910 --> 02:48:27,330
I kind of keyboard smash for a second.

2634
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:32,000
Oh, just do it fast.

2635
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:32,560
Just do it fast.

2636
02:48:32,680 --> 02:48:33,600
Just get it through it.

2637
02:48:33,780 --> 02:48:34,140
AHHHHH!

2638
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:42,000
No.

2639
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:46,260
A lot of people struggle to put food on their plates.

2640
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:48,000
That wasn't enough.

2641
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:49,580
Right, Captain?

2642
02:48:50,420 --> 02:48:53,580
The lowest rung of your ladder is our highest.

2643
02:48:55,220 --> 02:48:57,460
Until it was all swept from under your feet.

2644
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:59,640
Jimmy is such a freak!

2645
02:49:01,620 --> 02:49:02,700
Muy, muy, cute!

2646
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:07,000
Life isn't even worth living at the same level as us.

2647
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:09,940
But I forgive you.

2648
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:11,560
All of us do.

2649
02:49:13,060 --> 02:49:14,360
I won't give up on you.

2650
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:15,300
Even like this.

2651
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:49,460

2652
02:49:52,200 --> 02:49:53,380
You taught me that, Curly.

2653
02:49:55,580 --> 02:49:56,160
Let's eat.

2654
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:58,160
Let's survive.

2655
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:05,740
Take responsibility!

2656
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:12,020
What's happening?

2657
02:50:15,220 --> 02:50:15,720
Oh.

2658
02:50:17,100 --> 02:50:19,180
Why is it all messed up?

2659
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:19,720
Oh.

2660
02:50:23,090 --> 02:50:23,770
Wee!

2661
02:50:24,350 --> 02:50:25,410
I am.

2662
02:50:28,310 --> 02:50:31,970
I still don't quite get how Daisuke got injured though.

2663
02:50:46,340 --> 02:50:46,360
Soup.

2664
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:47,540
Chess.

2665
02:50:51,530 --> 02:50:52,950
I can't see anything.

2666
02:50:54,090 --> 02:50:54,590
Oh, there we go.

2667
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:56,670
Injured in the vent.

2668
02:50:56,910 --> 02:50:57,930
Yeah, but like, I don't know.

2669
02:51:00,050 --> 02:51:02,350
I guess just machinery, something cut him up.

2670
02:51:06,630 --> 02:51:09,050
Oh, that's freaky.

2671
02:51:09,610 --> 02:51:10,550
Oh, that's good.

2672
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:12,470
Oh!

2673
02:51:19,460 --> 02:51:19,460
Danger.

2674
02:51:20,360 --> 02:51:21,280
Hands off, idiots!

2675
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:27,830
The flower from the drink.

2676
02:51:32,270 --> 02:51:34,030
This game has great visuals.

2677
02:51:37,190 --> 02:51:38,570
Well, turning back now.

2678
02:51:40,550 --> 02:51:40,650
Oh.

2679
02:51:41,410 --> 02:51:42,090
Oh,

2680
02:51:47,310 --> 02:51:47,990
that's cool!

2681
02:51:50,650 --> 02:51:51,790
What do I do, though?

2682
02:52:01,390 --> 02:52:03,550
That is a cool effect.

2683
02:52:04,010 --> 02:52:04,950
Oh, walk backwards.

2684
02:52:08,430 --> 02:52:12,910
Like one of those typical horror game moments.

2685
02:52:16,910 --> 02:52:18,370
It looked like a face, right?

2686
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:29,750
You're lost.

2687
02:52:33,470 --> 02:52:34,170
Oh.

2688
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:36,210
I can't look at it.

2689
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:42,610
It's his hands and his like stuff, his little dumbbells and his Game Boy.

2690
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:48,260
Responsibility.

2691
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:51,640
It's a big theme in this game.

2692
02:52:52,180 --> 02:52:52,180
Hi.

2693
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:04,190
Take it.

2694
02:53:04,410 --> 02:53:05,430
Want to take the Game Boy?

2695
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:13,820
Oh!

2696
02:53:14,180 --> 02:53:14,360
Oops.

2697
02:53:21,360 --> 02:53:22,340
I guess I can keep walking.

2698
02:53:34,440 --> 02:53:36,740
Do I keep... I'm just running away from my problems.

2699
02:53:37,360 --> 02:53:38,500
You have to take it.

2700
02:53:41,900 --> 02:53:43,140
Yeah, I'm backing away.

2701
02:53:50,180 --> 02:53:50,920
Oh, I take respawn.

2702
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,460
I'm running away from my responsibility.

2703
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:54,680
Oh, it's getting loud.

2704
02:53:58,870 --> 02:53:59,310
Cool.

2705
02:54:02,770 --> 02:54:04,670
It was just so much longer than I expected.

2706
02:54:05,770 --> 02:54:07,210
Of having to run backwards.

2707
02:54:12,050 --> 02:54:13,030
Where are we?

2708
02:54:14,310 --> 02:54:15,470
Utility is still missing.

2709
02:54:17,210 --> 02:54:17,650
Hmm.

2710
02:54:20,170 --> 02:54:20,930
Whoa!

2711
02:54:21,310 --> 02:54:21,490
Whoa!

2712
02:54:22,090 --> 02:54:22,250
Whoa!

2713
02:54:23,310 --> 02:54:23,310
Whoa!

2714
02:54:32,130 --> 02:54:32,430
Whoa!

2715
02:54:33,170 --> 02:54:33,170
Whoa!

2716
02:54:33,690 --> 02:54:33,690
Whoa!

2717
02:54:33,850 --> 02:54:34,470
Whoa!

2718
02:54:34,470 --> 02:54:36,030
Oh my gosh!

2719
02:54:36,930 --> 02:54:40,930
Wait, I kind of wanted to see the flower!

2720
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:46,360
It looked nice.

2721
02:54:49,580 --> 02:54:51,360
Oh, all the axes?

2722
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:53,740
Oh, it's getting real spooky, you guys.

2723
02:55:08,670 --> 02:55:09,650
I'm scared.

2724
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:21,780
Is that us or is there someone else crawling?

2725
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:25,280
Like the heartbeat sound too is...

2726
02:55:29,740 --> 02:55:32,000
Okay, yeah, there's definitely something else.

2727
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:32,960
Someone else?

2728
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:34,280
Another thing?

2729
02:55:34,860 --> 02:55:35,980
In the... in here?

2730
02:55:42,390 --> 02:55:42,770
Okay.

2731
02:55:43,610 --> 02:55:44,190
Nothing here?

2732
02:55:44,390 --> 02:55:44,530
Alright.

2733
02:55:47,130 --> 02:55:47,890
Freaky.

2734
02:55:50,170 --> 02:55:51,170
It's just rats.

2735
02:55:52,790 --> 02:55:57,850
this is rats and dice game

2736
02:56:01,450 --> 02:56:19,590
I didn't I mean I knew that like it would be bleak you know for everybody considering the situation in general but like I didn't I thought Anya was gonna I thought Anya was gonna live what was that I

2737
02:56:24,760 --> 02:56:30,350
At least.

2738
02:56:35,130 --> 02:56:35,850
Swansea!

2739
02:56:37,070 --> 02:56:37,330
No.

2740
02:56:39,550 --> 02:56:39,890
No.

2741
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:42,690
Looking at him.

2742
02:56:43,070 --> 02:56:43,810
Looking at me.

2743
02:56:49,240 --> 02:56:50,420
Personal protection weapon.

2744
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:53,060
Issued to captains in case of unrest amongst the crew.

2745
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:59,070
I don't even get to talk to him.

2746
02:57:00,830 --> 02:57:01,550
No.

2747
02:57:03,810 --> 02:57:17,090

2749
02:57:41,210 --> 02:57:42,230
Wait, a zombie game?

2750
02:57:44,270 --> 02:57:44,530
What?

2751
02:57:47,650 --> 02:57:48,430
What is...

2752
02:57:49,650 --> 02:57:51,130
This is so freaky!

2753
02:58:00,900 --> 02:58:02,220
What is this?

2754
02:58:03,300 --> 02:58:04,440
Beloved friend.

2755
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:07,940
Oh.

2756
02:58:14,500 --> 02:58:16,000
Oh my gosh.

2757
02:58:16,180 --> 02:58:18,700
I almost did not make that.

2758
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:19,920
Oh my god.

2759
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:32,030
I hear him.

2760
02:58:38,110 --> 02:58:38,890
I missed.

2761
02:58:41,110 --> 02:58:41,950
I

2762
02:58:49,940 --> 02:58:51,620
was totally camping.

2763
02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:53,240
I'm sorry.

2764
02:58:57,700 --> 02:58:59,260
I have something to say.

2765
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:01,640
So shut up and listen.

2766
02:59:07,170 --> 02:59:11,050
I spent 13 years half cut up to my eyeballs.

2767
02:59:12,750 --> 02:59:15,370
Drunk, to put it mildly.

2768
02:59:16,470 --> 02:59:21,410
Then suddenly I saw it, a streetlight shining in my face.

2769
02:59:22,670 --> 02:59:25,630
500 gigawatts of the power of God.

2770
02:59:26,810 --> 02:59:29,950
A vision of my bloated body found in some ditch.

2771
02:59:32,230 --> 02:59:33,530
Scared me straight.

2772
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:37,890
So I got a collar shirt, mortgage, and a credit card.

2773
02:59:38,950 --> 02:59:41,270
All the things that make me a good man.

2774
02:59:43,790 --> 02:59:46,830
I hoped I could raise my children to be better than their old man.

2775
02:59:48,110 --> 02:59:52,310
I wanted to believe I was never one setback away from my worst self.

2776
02:59:53,790 --> 03:00:02,070
But the truth is, discipline, drive, routine, the endless desperation to get shit done.

2777
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:08,930
A loving wife, right kids, sobriety, I'm telling you.

2778
03:00:08,950 --> 03:01:30,930
you you accomplishments I've been chasing all my life never felt as good as I expected when I crossed the finish line so now that we're at the end take an inventory those nights spinning out of my of my head sinking into the sofa broken glass in my palms bleeding dry the funniest thing ever old dogs laughing and snarling on a waterbed floor mocking the moon for daring to show its face all nausea and wreckage and vomit and ugly cruelty the only problem in the world the only problem in the world an empty bottle those were the best days of my life yeah those were the best days of my life I've I got nothing to hide ready to face the music I can see myself for what am are you a cowardly selfish motherfucker and you can't even see it I should have been able to protect the kid if I have could if I could have done one thing right I wish I had been to give him one small chance off this goddamn rock oh my Oh my god,

2779
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:31,470
Jimmy.

2780
03:01:32,430 --> 03:01:32,890
Swatzy.

2781
03:01:33,410 --> 03:01:34,770
I'm going to fix everything.

2782
03:01:37,070 --> 03:01:39,190
We're going to make it.

2783
03:01:39,810 --> 03:01:41,630
Fuck you.

2784
03:01:53,420 --> 03:01:54,780
Take responsibility.

2785
03:02:05,950 --> 03:02:10,210
Oh, yeah, I swear when I mean it.

2786
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:13,950
I don't want to just say it all the time.

2787
03:02:13,950 --> 03:02:16,950
Only when it really is a...

2788
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:18,930
What is that?

2789
03:02:19,110 --> 03:02:20,910
A picture of a dog?

2790
03:02:31,670 --> 03:02:32,290
What?

2791
03:02:33,810 --> 03:02:35,430
Almost all the foam is gone.

2792
03:02:35,670 --> 03:02:35,790
What?

2793
03:02:37,230 --> 03:02:38,350
I just realized.

2794
03:02:43,770 --> 03:02:46,870
We're still in mind...

2795
03:02:47,390 --> 03:02:48,490
Illusion world.

2796
03:02:49,310 --> 03:02:53,450
If you check the pod before you shot Swansea, It would be full of Daisuke's heads.

2797
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:54,530
Yeah, wait!

2798
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:58,070
What pod before I shot him?

2799
03:02:58,110 --> 03:02:59,010
There was no pod.

2800
03:02:59,270 --> 03:02:59,730
Was there?

2801
03:03:03,510 --> 03:03:04,550
Whoa, whoa.

2802
03:03:06,730 --> 03:03:09,430
You know how they talk about cable management for computers?

2803
03:03:09,670 --> 03:03:10,970
This shit means pipe management.

2804
03:03:29,220 --> 03:03:29,820
Curly.

2805
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:33,440
That's freaky.

2806
03:03:37,910 --> 03:03:38,530
Oh, hey!

2807
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:45,460
Oh, hey!

2808
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:49,460
Whoa, the walls are growing eyeballs!

2809
03:03:52,820 --> 03:03:54,060
Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

2810
03:04:01,230 --> 03:04:01,670
Whoa!

2811
03:04:04,770 --> 03:04:08,730
Every box in front of fries at Arby's has one big curly.

2812
03:04:10,190 --> 03:04:10,470
Ah!

2813
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:16,310
I'm in...

2814
03:04:18,300 --> 03:04:19,120
I'm...

2815
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:19,260
Oh.

2816
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:21,040
Uh...

2817
03:04:23,020 --> 03:04:25,900
I hope this isn't at the intestines.

2818
03:04:28,140 --> 03:04:28,820
Intestines?

2819
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:32,920
Maybe this is the throat.

2820
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:36,340
I'm just gonna run through here.

2821
03:04:39,180 --> 03:04:43,280
Oh, the audio in this game is so good.

2822
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:46,020
Holy heck, it's so good.

2823
03:04:48,680 --> 03:04:50,340
Oh, we were in the throat.

2824
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:52,580
This is the mouth.

2825
03:05:02,970 --> 03:05:03,790
I

2826
03:05:09,670 --> 03:05:17,450
hear like other footprints or not footprints but footsteps along with mine.

2827
03:05:18,930 --> 03:05:21,990
Do you guys hear it?

2828
03:05:35,200 --> 03:05:36,020
Curly.

2829
03:05:37,460 --> 03:05:38,420
What is this?

2830
03:05:41,660 --> 03:05:42,260
Oh!

2831
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:46,140
Okay, hold on.

2832
03:05:48,820 --> 03:05:51,180
It is all Mother Goose's birthday.

2833
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:53,280
We're giving her a party.

2834
03:05:53,820 --> 03:05:58,620
A party, a party, a party for Mother Goose.

2835
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:05,140
The baker man, he served the cake.

2836
03:06:05,140 --> 03:06:07,120
Wait, why is like the cursor in the TV?

2837
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:07,620
You see this?

2838
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:11,840
Take Curly's leg

2839
03:06:17,820 --> 03:06:20,060
Okay Oh

2840
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:25,080
the children

2841
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:48,020
That's a potato I could go for a potato right now I love baked potato It's people Oh gosh you guys have been playing way too many games.

2842
03:06:48,340 --> 03:06:51,780
I can reference multiple games about eating people.

2843
03:06:56,240 --> 03:07:03,240
I have played so many games about cannibalism recently that I can reference multiple games.

2844
03:07:06,480 --> 03:07:07,280
Can I leave?

2845
03:07:09,280 --> 03:07:10,980
Okay, we took his leg.

2846
03:07:12,360 --> 03:07:13,280
Oh my gosh.

2847
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:16,600
This is... I don't quite understand what the puzzle is.

2848
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:18,380
Um...

2849
03:07:21,710 --> 03:07:22,710
Oh!

2850
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:24,270
Ah!

2851
03:07:27,110 --> 03:07:28,110
Ah!

2852
03:07:29,130 --> 03:07:30,890
Does it like change the TV or anything?

2853
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,100
Someday he'll thank me!

2854
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:42,340
Oh my god!

2855
03:07:46,300 --> 03:07:46,800
Wait.

2856
03:07:50,470 --> 03:07:52,570
I need to get closer?

2857
03:07:54,650 --> 03:07:58,530
Oh my god, no, no, no way!

2858
03:07:58,550 --> 03:07:59,930
No, what?

2859
03:08:03,150 --> 03:08:04,170
Oh my god!

2860
03:08:14,710 --> 03:08:15,810
Wait, I didn't notice...

2861
03:08:15,810 --> 03:08:17,190
Okay, I only saw it.

2862
03:08:25,450 --> 03:08:27,230
I didn't see where it started at all.

2863
03:08:27,570 --> 03:08:28,630
Oh, his mouth is closed.

2864
03:08:28,850 --> 03:08:29,050
My bad.

2865
03:08:29,890 --> 03:08:30,730
Open wide!

2866
03:08:32,830 --> 03:08:34,030
Okay, where's it start?

2867
03:08:34,390 --> 03:08:35,490
Okay, up there.

2868
03:08:37,090 --> 03:08:37,270
Ah!

2869
03:08:38,850 --> 03:08:39,590
Okay, hi.

2870
03:08:51,260 --> 03:08:53,840
So this was right before...

2871
03:08:54,260 --> 03:08:55,640
Oh, this is a little confusing.

2872
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:56,280
Okay.

2873
03:08:57,900 --> 03:08:59,820
Good thing he throws up the whole chunk, right?

2874
03:09:04,010 --> 03:09:08,090
If I had a nickel for every time I play a game featuring cannibalism, I'd have two nickels.

2875
03:09:08,430 --> 03:09:08,470
Nope.

2876
03:09:09,310 --> 03:09:10,830
Skunk face, I'd have three!

2877
03:09:13,950 --> 03:09:16,410
Okay, it starts there, it goes up.

2878
03:09:16,590 --> 03:09:16,690
Oh.

2879
03:09:18,450 --> 03:09:19,610
Uh-oh, did I mess up?

2880
03:09:19,730 --> 03:09:20,050
Okay.

2881
03:09:21,510 --> 03:09:23,370
How am I supposed to turn this one though?

2882
03:09:35,910 --> 03:09:36,950
Wait, what's this one turn?

2883
03:09:37,370 --> 03:09:37,850
Okay, that.

2884
03:09:39,990 --> 03:09:40,390
Uh...

2885
03:09:45,410 --> 03:09:49,630
I had it going to this one, so I'm kind of just like, dang it, I had it.

2886
03:09:50,030 --> 03:09:51,290
Hold on, let's try again.

2887
03:09:53,530 --> 03:09:54,110
Oh, whoops.

2888
03:09:54,970 --> 03:09:55,750
Oh, there, oh, just kidding.

2889
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:56,770
Okay, up.

2890
03:09:57,270 --> 03:09:58,550
No, okay, this one needs to turn.

2891
03:09:58,930 --> 03:09:58,970
Okay.

2892
03:10:00,710 --> 03:10:02,530
Stop being so dramatic, buddy.

2893
03:10:03,050 --> 03:10:03,230
Okay.

2894
03:10:07,390 --> 03:10:08,350
Yeah, good thing.

2895
03:10:08,950 --> 03:10:11,250
Maybe he needs a mooy-mooy cube for his meal.

2896
03:10:11,910 --> 03:10:12,350
What?

2897
03:10:12,730 --> 03:10:13,910
Wait, but I had...

2898
03:10:18,110 --> 03:10:20,430
Is it this bottom one that was messed up?

2899
03:10:20,610 --> 03:10:22,410
But it went...

2900
03:10:31,650 --> 03:10:32,870
Bottom left needs to go up.

2901
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:33,190
Okay.

2902
03:10:34,770 --> 03:10:35,890
So it is now.

2903
03:10:36,170 --> 03:10:36,930
Okay, hold on.

2904
03:10:37,710 --> 03:10:38,910
Sorry, I'm figuring it out.

2905
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:43,150
Okay, through there.

2906
03:10:43,710 --> 03:10:44,530
Through there.

2907
03:10:44,950 --> 03:10:45,850
Up there.

2908
03:10:46,510 --> 03:10:46,850
Okay.

2909
03:10:47,010 --> 03:10:47,350
Ah!

2910
03:10:49,550 --> 03:10:52,310
It might... Okay, so this one hasn't been touched yet.

2911
03:10:52,430 --> 03:10:56,070
So it's one of the... So it has to be this one that needs to be moved.

2912
03:10:59,090 --> 03:10:59,650
Most likely.

2913
03:11:00,070 --> 03:11:00,490
Oh, oops.

2914
03:11:00,690 --> 03:11:01,870
Oh, I forgot to grab it.

2915
03:11:02,910 --> 03:11:05,570
Thank you so much for the rhythm break.

2916
03:11:05,770 --> 03:11:07,890
Sorry, you came in at the, like, the craziest time.

2917
03:11:08,890 --> 03:11:09,430
Four games?

2918
03:11:09,630 --> 03:11:10,470
Peak had it, too.

2919
03:11:10,750 --> 03:11:11,610
Oh, wait.

2920
03:11:12,510 --> 03:11:14,230
I didn't eat anybody in Peak.

2921
03:11:15,850 --> 03:11:16,610
Okay, here.

2922
03:11:17,370 --> 03:11:17,810
Ah!

2923
03:11:21,490 --> 03:11:21,970
Uh.

2924
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:23,750
Alright, let's change that.

2925
03:11:23,770 --> 03:11:24,370
Okay.

2926
03:11:26,230 --> 03:11:27,290
We're getting this.

2927
03:11:27,510 --> 03:11:28,330
Oh, my bad.

2928
03:11:28,730 --> 03:11:29,290
Open up.

2929
03:11:31,450 --> 03:11:35,070
It's losing its effect because I'm like stuck on the puzzle, you know?

2930
03:11:35,750 --> 03:11:36,250
Okay, there we go.

2931
03:11:36,390 --> 03:11:37,230
There we go.

2932
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:38,770
Through and...

2933
03:11:39,790 --> 03:11:40,210
Ah!

2934
03:11:40,670 --> 03:11:41,490
I think we did it!

2935
03:11:41,570 --> 03:11:42,390
Oh, just kidding.

2936
03:11:44,550 --> 03:11:47,230
Thank you guys so much for the gifted.

2937
03:11:47,630 --> 03:11:47,950
Thank you.

2938
03:11:48,270 --> 03:11:48,610
All right.

2939
03:11:48,730 --> 03:11:50,350
This is the final version.

2940
03:11:52,490 --> 03:11:53,410
Final version.

2941
03:11:53,650 --> 03:11:53,750
All right.

2942
03:11:53,770 --> 03:11:54,530
Alright, eat up!

2943
03:11:54,750 --> 03:11:55,590
Eat up, Curly!

2944
03:11:57,510 --> 03:11:59,030
I think of music.

2945
03:12:06,130 --> 03:12:07,430
Into your tummy.

2946
03:12:12,760 --> 03:12:14,500
Help me.

2947
03:12:15,820 --> 03:12:18,220
He's trapped in space!

2948
03:12:19,780 --> 03:12:19,780
Oh,

2949
03:12:22,970 --> 03:12:23,930
I'm controlling him.

2950
03:12:24,410 --> 03:12:25,810
My little video game man.

2951
03:12:28,950 --> 03:12:29,390
Whoa!

2952
03:12:40,530 --> 03:12:41,050
Whoa!

2953
03:12:41,930 --> 03:12:45,650
No matter what key I hold, by the way, he just walks forward, so...

2954
03:12:47,850 --> 03:12:48,930
Look at him.

2955
03:12:49,630 --> 03:12:51,050
Like he's walking a runway.

2956
03:12:54,010 --> 03:12:54,810
Oh, Jimmy.

2957
03:12:56,090 --> 03:12:57,030
Man on fire.

2958
03:13:02,340 --> 03:13:03,380
Jimmy Quest.

2959
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:07,020
Oh!

2960
03:13:08,820 --> 03:13:11,440
Why are you on fire now, girl?

2961
03:13:11,460 --> 03:13:16,700
Oh, well, I guess that's what happened to make all this skin, you know, come off, huh?

2962
03:13:18,180 --> 03:13:19,440
I want to go home.

2963
03:13:20,640 --> 03:13:22,340
We are home.

2964
03:13:22,620 --> 03:13:23,660
Oh, my gosh.

2965
03:13:23,980 --> 03:13:24,520
Chippy.

2966
03:13:25,380 --> 03:13:27,460
The red light is just making...

2967
03:13:29,220 --> 03:13:31,300
Why don't you finish what you started?

2968
03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:34,620
Don't worry if anyone ever finds us.

2969
03:13:35,320 --> 03:13:36,900
I'll still be playing the villain.

2970
03:13:39,220 --> 03:13:39,700
Curly.

2971
03:13:40,320 --> 03:13:40,920
Curly.

2972
03:13:41,880 --> 03:14:09,090
you'll be the better man in the end like you wanted curly is almost just as bad as Jimmy is I could have stopped it I'm taking responsibility no we can both be heroes we're a team just you and me like we used to be

2973
03:14:15,930 --> 03:14:27,370

2974
03:14:33,150 --> 03:14:47,220
no we're back in the vents Take responsibility.

2975
03:14:51,940 --> 03:14:54,060
The vents have been upgraded a little bit.

2976
03:14:54,580 --> 03:14:56,740
Oh, I have a thing.

2977
03:14:57,640 --> 03:14:58,460
What is it searched for?

2978
03:14:59,720 --> 03:15:00,080
Oh, yeah.

2979
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:00,900
Sorry.

2980
03:15:01,640 --> 03:15:03,240
Probably just destroyed the bitrate.

2981
03:15:06,980 --> 03:15:07,540
Oh.

2982
03:15:09,400 --> 03:15:09,960
What?

2983
03:15:10,220 --> 03:15:14,540
What am I looking for in here?

2984
03:15:14,720 --> 03:15:15,260
A baby?

2985
03:15:24,750 --> 03:15:27,110
Am I looking for a way to get inside or...

2986
03:15:28,550 --> 03:15:28,730
Oh,

2987
03:15:41,660 --> 03:15:43,380
I heard a heartbeat.

2988
03:15:52,060 --> 03:15:52,980
I wish I could run.

2989
03:15:54,580 --> 03:15:55,100
Like...

2990
03:16:05,010 --> 03:16:06,690
I'm so close to the sound.

2991
03:16:07,930 --> 03:16:08,990
It feels like at least.

2992
03:16:20,850 --> 03:16:21,150
What?

2993
03:16:26,820 --> 03:16:27,860
Oh, it...

2994
03:16:30,120 --> 03:16:34,330
What am I looking for?

2995
03:16:35,050 --> 03:16:35,570
What am I looking for?

2996
03:16:35,590 --> 03:16:36,710
Where is it?

2997
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:43,740
Oh, there it is!

2998
03:16:50,060 --> 03:16:50,500
Um...

2999
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:51,580
What the hell?

3000
03:16:55,930 --> 03:16:58,010
Oh, I saw- I thought I- I think I saw it.

3001
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:02,540
There it is!

3002
03:17:06,240 --> 03:17:08,500
No, but this is how your Uma Musume is born.

3003
03:17:12,350 --> 03:17:13,950
The baby's from the beginning.

3004
03:17:15,470 --> 03:17:17,110
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot about them.

3005
03:17:44,480 --> 03:17:46,000
All clean.

3006
03:17:46,780 --> 03:17:48,060
I hope this hurts.

3007
03:17:48,660 --> 03:17:51,160
Really gets rid of that bad taste in your mouth, huh?

3008
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:54,360
Through wreckage.

3009
03:17:55,440 --> 03:17:56,500
Through silence.

3010
03:17:58,640 --> 03:17:59,320
Wash it away.

3011
03:18:01,080 --> 03:18:02,680
All day fire fresh.

3012
03:18:12,200 --> 03:18:12,540
Oh.

3013
03:18:16,110 --> 03:18:18,970
Oh, it's the pieces of the horse.

3014
03:18:19,330 --> 03:18:20,330
I'm sorry.

3015
03:18:20,730 --> 03:18:21,410
Oh my gosh.

3016
03:18:25,830 --> 03:18:26,470
Oh no.

3017
03:18:26,570 --> 03:18:27,690
Is this like another boss?

3018
03:18:30,910 --> 03:18:31,770
Oh my gosh.

3019
03:18:35,130 --> 03:18:35,370
Ah!

3020
03:18:42,520 --> 03:18:44,440
Do I have to be quiet again like before?

3021
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:50,100
Oh my gosh.

3022
03:18:50,380 --> 03:18:51,440
Scared the heck you out of me.

3023
03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:53,380
Oh my god.

3024
03:18:54,260 --> 03:18:55,000
I'm just running.

3025
03:19:18,110 --> 03:19:18,990
Oh gosh.

3026
03:19:21,900 --> 03:19:23,640
I'm running into darkness.

3027
03:19:24,260 --> 03:19:25,740
Oh, what are these?

3028
03:19:26,360 --> 03:19:28,540
Oh, everybody's employee cards.

3029
03:19:41,930 --> 03:19:43,410
What are you trying to tell me?

3030
03:19:48,050 --> 03:19:50,410
Is the horse supposed to get you?

3031
03:19:51,070 --> 03:19:53,870
Oh yeah, sorry if the bitrate here is like craziness.

3032
03:20:09,860 --> 03:20:10,120
Whoa.

3033
03:20:18,290 --> 03:20:18,930
Okay.

3034
03:20:19,890 --> 03:20:20,650
Kind of ASMR.

3035
03:20:22,330 --> 03:20:22,970
Okay.

3036
03:20:25,450 --> 03:20:27,750
I'm so on edge now!

3037
03:20:28,510 --> 03:20:29,550
From the horse!

3038
03:20:30,930 --> 03:20:31,350
You!

3039
03:20:32,470 --> 03:20:33,310
From you!

3040
03:20:34,830 --> 03:20:35,890
Oh, hey Polly!

3041
03:20:53,130 --> 03:20:54,690
Pony Express is dead.

3042
03:20:55,790 --> 03:20:56,730
And so are you.

3043
03:21:05,670 --> 03:21:07,130
Hey, boss!

3044
03:21:10,230 --> 03:21:12,230
Polly says...

3045
03:21:12,230 --> 03:21:12,430
Oh.

3046
03:21:13,410 --> 03:21:14,170
Sorry.

3047
03:21:14,910 --> 03:21:16,070
Shut up.

3048
03:21:16,850 --> 03:21:18,250
Curly tried his best.

3049
03:21:18,730 --> 03:21:19,830
I did too.

3050
03:21:20,790 --> 03:21:22,430
But he's the better man.

3051
03:21:23,030 --> 03:21:23,930
I see that now.

3052
03:21:24,830 --> 03:21:26,690
We can both still make it.

3053
03:21:28,870 --> 03:21:29,930
I'll take care of him.

3054
03:21:30,430 --> 03:21:31,870
I'm taking responsibility.

3055
03:21:32,690 --> 03:21:35,610
Curly, Captain, I'm so sorry.

3056
03:21:40,810 --> 03:21:41,090
Yes.

3057
03:21:41,770 --> 03:21:44,170
Yes, yes, yes, I do.

3058
03:21:44,730 --> 03:21:45,870
For now, thank you so much for the 20 gift.

3059
03:21:45,950 --> 03:21:46,410
Thank you.

3060
03:21:46,810 --> 03:21:47,630
Thank you so much.

3061
03:21:48,010 --> 03:21:48,870
I messed up.

3062
03:21:49,750 --> 03:21:51,550
We can still make this right.

3063
03:21:52,730 --> 03:21:54,270
Thank you so much for the 20 games.

3064
03:21:54,370 --> 03:21:55,030
Thank you!

3065
03:21:55,310 --> 03:21:55,810
What the heck?

3066
03:21:56,190 --> 03:21:57,110
Thank you both so much.

3067
03:21:58,490 --> 03:22:01,450
Our worst moments don't make us...

3068
03:22:12,170 --> 03:22:14,530
I like the voice effect on Polly so much.

3069
03:22:14,650 --> 03:22:15,150
It's so cool.

3070
03:22:22,330 --> 03:22:24,310
Zero hours before judgment.

3071
03:22:32,210 --> 03:22:33,030
I have them.

3072
03:22:38,730 --> 03:22:40,610
How are you still alive?

3073
03:22:40,850 --> 03:22:41,890
There's no way.

3074
03:22:42,550 --> 03:22:43,730
There's no way!

3075
03:22:48,490 --> 03:22:50,750
Wait, oh, okay, that's her turtleneck.

3076
03:22:50,930 --> 03:22:52,610
I thought, like, okay, okay.

3077
03:22:53,370 --> 03:22:55,850
I thought her, like, neck was bulging or something, creepy.

3078
03:23:06,040 --> 03:23:08,640
Curly feels like he's alive out of pure spite.

3079
03:23:11,830 --> 03:23:12,590
Where are we going?

3080
03:23:27,650 --> 03:23:28,110
Rain?

3081
03:23:29,530 --> 03:23:30,290
Go home?

3082
03:23:41,250 --> 03:23:41,510
Utility.

3083
03:23:42,450 --> 03:23:42,990
Utility.

3084
03:23:45,570 --> 03:23:45,910
Wait.

3085
03:24:06,390 --> 03:24:06,930
No.

3086
03:24:08,830 --> 03:24:17,630
this guy is not going to make it we're gonna cradle him like a baby in here with us

3087
03:24:22,970 --> 03:24:25,050
oh my god he didn't even get in

3088
03:24:31,500 --> 03:24:45,800
it's okay curly you're going to be okay oh my god this is jimmy's solution for fixing it you always had my back i ended up hurting you even though i was trying to save us But now you'll survive.

3089
03:24:46,580 --> 03:24:47,280
It's like you said.

3090
03:24:47,920 --> 03:24:49,320
Together we can fix anything.

3091
03:24:49,540 --> 03:24:52,720
I think Jimmy's a yandere for Curly.

3092
03:24:56,140 --> 03:24:57,520
Oh my god!

3093
03:25:03,770 --> 03:25:06,730
I'm just proud I got to be your friend and co-pilot.

3094
03:25:07,670 --> 03:25:08,230
Captain!

3095
03:25:09,410 --> 03:25:11,110
No one can hurt you now.

3096
03:25:13,010 --> 03:25:14,210
We fixed it.

3097
03:25:15,430 --> 03:25:16,730
Don't be like I fixed it!

3098
03:25:23,240 --> 03:25:23,800
What

3099
03:25:35,050 --> 03:25:36,770
are you gonna do then?

3100
03:25:50,200 --> 03:25:51,340
That's what he's gonna do.

3101
03:25:52,980 --> 03:25:54,240
We did it, Patrick.

3102
03:25:54,480 --> 03:25:54,780
We saved it.

3103
03:25:54,980 --> 03:25:56,200
Did he turn on the pod?

3104
03:25:59,790 --> 03:25:59,950
Oh.

3105
03:26:00,450 --> 03:26:00,930
Oh, he did.

3106
03:26:01,050 --> 03:26:01,190
He did.

3107
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:01,550
He did.

3108
03:26:04,170 --> 03:26:05,490
Oh, my God.

3109
03:26:05,730 --> 03:26:07,470
He literally...

3110
03:26:09,970 --> 03:26:12,510
He just doomed this guy.

3111
03:26:13,230 --> 03:26:15,190
Mystery of the mouthwash.

3112
03:26:15,830 --> 03:26:16,110
Ah!

3113
03:26:16,130 --> 03:26:18,270
Oh my god!

3114
03:26:22,250 --> 03:26:26,290
He doomed this guy to a horrible life.

3115
03:26:27,770 --> 03:26:28,930
If he ever gets rescued.

3116
03:26:34,510 --> 03:26:36,100
Glad you got to play this game in tow.

3117
03:26:38,890 --> 03:26:39,710
Thank you!

3118
03:26:39,850 --> 03:26:41,930
Camp Patrol, thank you so much for the pink.

3119
03:26:42,290 --> 03:26:44,070
Wow, oh my god.

3120
03:26:44,470 --> 03:26:45,810
Oh, I can't move my head anymore.

3121
03:26:55,400 --> 03:26:55,820
Oh!

3122
03:27:02,340 --> 03:27:10,180
Wow, wow, I'm sad that almost that I like put off this game for so long now.

3123
03:27:12,300 --> 03:27:15,240
Wow, yeah, I'm frozen.

3124
03:27:17,480 --> 03:27:22,580
I'm just gonna be a little jerky curly for the rest of my...

3125
03:27:22,580 --> 03:27:27,300
Who has... Nobody has this much skin to skin graft me.

3126
03:27:29,120 --> 03:27:31,780
Kind of makes that Anya Nendo a bit grim.

3127
03:27:32,440 --> 03:27:34,060
Oh, well, I mean...

3128
03:27:35,180 --> 03:27:42,980
I think tragic characters and characters from tragic series are made into toys all the time.

3129
03:27:43,200 --> 03:27:45,440
I mean, you can get the nurses from Silent Hill, too.

3130
03:27:47,960 --> 03:27:49,120
Thanks for playing!

3131
03:27:52,300 --> 03:27:53,520
Follow us, quit.

3132
03:27:54,680 --> 03:27:56,240
I'm guessing this is like Twitter.

3133
03:27:57,380 --> 03:27:58,620
Jimmy or Huey?

3134
03:28:00,680 --> 03:28:03,500
Um, oh gosh, they're both real bad.

3135
03:28:05,400 --> 03:28:06,580
Oh, I just clicked quit.

3136
03:28:07,020 --> 03:28:07,580
My bad.

3137
03:28:08,780 --> 03:28:08,840
Wow.

3138
03:28:09,940 --> 03:28:10,280
Wee.

3139
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:11,060
Wow.

3140
03:28:12,480 --> 03:28:13,980
Made my friend play it yesterday.

3141
03:28:14,460 --> 03:28:15,780
She said I hated that.

3142
03:28:16,080 --> 03:28:17,700
It was a good game, but I hated that here.

3143
03:28:17,720 --> 03:28:20,060
I'll go to the void, so I'm not like...

3144
03:28:21,200 --> 03:28:22,760
It's so dark.

3145
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:29,800
Have you finally played this game?

3146
03:28:29,880 --> 03:28:30,220
Yeah!

3147
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:48,500
me fixed it frozen jerky oh and then he cuts off his leg before that too i just the guy is bleeding out no i'm so i'm so huh oh

3148
03:28:54,860 --> 03:29:19,160
wow first time seeing this never expected to be so heavy i've always seen like people talk like kind of you know how like okay i i feel like if i say this you might understand what i mean where it's like okay and i don't mean it in this way hold on i'm gonna put on some music

3149
03:29:23,300 --> 03:29:44,660
um so not a meme i never really saw memes of it i always saw it as like a tumblr game and what i mean by that is like the certain kind of fan base that it garnered i guess like how they act felt like, you know, they were like, I don't know, I don't know how to describe it.

3150
03:29:50,720 --> 03:29:52,220
I thought it was really good.

3151
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:57,140
And I just mean that, I don't mean that in terms of like the way the game is.

3152
03:29:57,320 --> 03:30:03,080
I mean that in the way, like how the fan base kind of took the series.

3153
03:30:03,280 --> 03:30:14,720
Because I never really saw so much of like fan art or anything like that, but I would see certain like fan arts that I would be like, oh, Reminds me of a Tumblr game.

3154
03:30:15,160 --> 03:30:17,380
I don't know how else to describe it.

3155
03:30:22,100 --> 03:30:22,860
Like Undertale.

3156
03:30:22,960 --> 03:30:24,180
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3157
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:25,140
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3158
03:30:26,400 --> 03:30:26,780
So.

3159
03:30:28,260 --> 03:30:29,260
I didn't see it.

3160
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:35,640
I really, honestly, like, I know I saw fan art because I remember seeing it, but I don't...

3161
03:30:35,640 --> 03:30:39,960
One, I didn't have context for anything, so I don't know what it meant.

3162
03:30:40,120 --> 03:30:42,920
And two, I don't remember any of it because it was so long ago.

3163
03:30:43,700 --> 03:30:47,200
hmm but

3164
03:30:51,030 --> 03:31:47,260
our tumblr games bad or good I don't mean it in that it's really just the way that the fan base acts towards the game it doesn't have a reflection on the game itself in my when I'm describing it when I'm describing it I mean it in a way that's like how the fan base acts about it not the game itself because I really like undertale i liked this there are some fandoms though that they are a little overzealous for my for for me so i oops it's not that i don't i don't really participate in a lot of fandom stuff anyway so i don't know i i kind of just like i like what i like and then i kind of just stay in my own bubble with it so that which i think honestly probably metal gear is the only thing that i've because,

3165
03:31:47,340 --> 03:31:54,480
like, I go to stuff like MGSCon, but then, even then, I just kind of go for the experience, and I don't really talk to anybody.

3166
03:31:57,820 --> 03:31:58,740
So, I don't know.

3167
03:31:58,800 --> 03:32:00,600
I'm just always in my own bubble kind of deal.

3168
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:03,440
I don't talk to people very much.

3169
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:04,380
I'm a ghost.

3170
03:32:04,740 --> 03:32:06,900
I'm just, I'm just haunting in the background.

3171
03:32:11,390 --> 03:32:12,830
You go for the game, not the fan base.

3172
03:32:13,010 --> 03:32:13,350
Yeah.

3173
03:32:13,730 --> 03:32:14,970
Of course it's always fun.

3174
03:32:15,490 --> 03:32:37,860

Yen Wei, thank you so much!

3178
03:33:28,840 --> 03:33:31,200
Did you know that good smile is taking pre-orders for the onion?

3179
03:33:31,380 --> 03:33:31,700
Yeah!

3180
03:33:32,040 --> 03:33:34,660
Wait, actually, now I'm gonna go look at the onion underwood.

3181
03:33:36,740 --> 03:33:37,140

Is it on Ami Ami already?

3183
03:33:40,060 --> 03:33:40,660
Let's see.

3184
03:33:46,890 --> 03:33:48,430
I don't see it.

3185
03:33:48,870 --> 03:33:49,830
Oh, I do see it.

3186
03:33:49,830 --> 03:33:50,150
Just kidding.

3187
03:33:50,590 --> 03:33:51,310
Let's see what it...

3188
03:33:51,950 --> 03:33:53,610
Oh my god!

3189
03:33:59,840 --> 03:34:03,200
Okay, it's a really good thing I didn't look at this beforehand.

3190
03:34:13,070 --> 03:34:17,110
Hold on for anybody who did not see it yet.

3191
03:34:18,490 --> 03:34:19,050
Are you...

3192
03:34:19,050 --> 03:34:19,670
Wow!

3193
03:34:22,490 --> 03:34:23,590
They have no chill.

3194
03:34:23,730 --> 03:34:24,450
For real!

3195
03:34:25,410 --> 03:34:26,770
Look at this!

3196
03:34:31,850 --> 03:34:32,670
I'm so...

3197
03:34:32,670 --> 03:34:35,890
I'm honestly surprised there's not little pill bottles that come with it.

3198
03:34:36,170 --> 03:34:37,650
This is messed up.

3199
03:34:38,410 --> 03:34:40,410
You always make cannibalism so fun.

3200
03:34:42,450 --> 03:34:42,930
Oh!

3201
03:34:44,950 --> 03:34:45,430
Wow!

3202
03:34:46,750 --> 03:34:47,090
Wait!

3203
03:34:47,410 --> 03:34:51,910
I have another game that I can add to my complete game list.

3204
03:34:52,630 --> 03:34:54,650
So now we're at...

3205
03:34:54,650 --> 03:34:55,170
Let's see.

3206
03:34:55,430 --> 03:34:55,770
10.

3207
03:34:57,770 --> 03:34:59,490
16, 20, 25.

3208
03:35:00,930 --> 03:35:01,410
Mouthwashing.

3209
03:35:01,610 --> 03:35:02,850
We're at 30 games!

3210
03:35:02,990 --> 03:35:06,550
I have 20 more games that I need to beat to hit my goal of 50 for the year.

3211
03:35:10,370 --> 03:35:11,910
It does not come with a pillbox.

3212
03:35:11,930 --> 03:35:12,310
bottle.

3213
03:35:12,630 --> 03:35:15,710
It comes with the little mouthwashing, though.

3214
03:35:16,870 --> 03:35:19,410
The Nendorite is so cute, too.

3215
03:35:19,770 --> 03:35:21,250
She looks so cute.

3216
03:35:21,630 --> 03:35:23,750
It's just messed up.

3217
03:35:25,830 --> 03:35:27,290
Looking forward to...

3218
03:35:27,290 --> 03:35:27,610
Oh, wait.

3219
03:35:28,050 --> 03:35:31,150
Did you notice that Polly and Anya had the same mint-colored text?

3220
03:35:31,730 --> 03:35:33,130
Oh, no, I didn't, actually.

3221
03:35:34,490 --> 03:35:35,870
Wait, I thought she was light blue.

3222
03:35:36,150 --> 03:35:37,510
Who am I thinking of as light blue?

3223
03:35:39,250 --> 03:35:39,850
Okay.

3224
03:35:41,930 --> 03:35:45,090
Pill model is a Good Smile exclusive!

3225
03:35:50,150 --> 03:35:52,470
Oh my gosh, also Dwarco, thank you so much for the pink!

3226
03:35:53,010 --> 03:35:56,450
That's true, but I'm with you, an evil protagonist in Legcat of Elizabeth Hawkeye.

3227
03:35:57,570 --> 03:36:00,450
This game was just Mystery of the Druids in disguise.

3228
03:36:02,750 --> 03:36:04,790
Wait, I have to go see the Good Smile.

3229
03:36:05,550 --> 03:36:06,250
Hot dog.

3230
03:36:10,330 --> 03:36:12,390
Let's see, Good Smile Company.

3231
03:36:14,430 --> 03:36:17,870
Congrats, Anya, for dethroning the previous most upsetting Nendo.

3232
03:36:19,270 --> 03:36:22,010
Chirase at her mother's laptop.

3233
03:36:22,490 --> 03:36:23,850
Oh, my God, that one is messed up.

3234
03:36:24,070 --> 03:36:30,530
It's always, like, so comical because they're like little baby, little baby, you know.

3235
03:36:30,710 --> 03:36:33,930
Oh, wow, this Ghost in the Shell figure is so cool.

3236
03:36:34,210 --> 03:36:36,670
They're like little chibi babies.

3237
03:36:37,050 --> 03:36:39,230
And then you get this.

3238
03:36:39,770 --> 03:36:41,970
Oh, my gosh, the bonus is the...

3239
03:36:41,970 --> 03:36:43,750
Oh, it's the painkillers.

3240
03:36:44,870 --> 03:36:49,070
And then also there's another bonus, which is the moon background.

3241
03:36:49,910 --> 03:36:51,870
And then there's another bonus, which is...

3242
03:36:54,050 --> 03:36:54,490
Food?

3243
03:36:58,230 --> 03:36:58,550
What?

3244
03:36:58,770 --> 03:37:00,630
This must be just a regular bonus.

3245
03:37:00,910 --> 03:37:01,890
That, like, a bunch of things.

3246
03:37:02,030 --> 03:37:03,830
Because that has nothing to do with mouthwashing.

3247
03:37:05,910 --> 03:37:10,850
It comes with a... It's like pizza and sushi and rice and donuts and takoyaki.

3248
03:37:11,510 --> 03:37:11,670
Huh?

3249
03:37:13,570 --> 03:37:15,410
Looking forward to the next new game history.

3250
03:37:15,430 --> 03:37:18,310
Can't wait how we'll be eating human meat then.

3251
03:37:18,770 --> 03:37:20,310
Recommend more...

3252
03:37:22,370 --> 03:37:24,970
More cannibal games for me, everybody.

3253
03:37:25,210 --> 03:37:29,510
Also, look at this Makoto Kusanagi figure.

3254
03:37:29,990 --> 03:37:30,670
Oh, I said Makoto.

3255
03:37:30,790 --> 03:37:31,830
Sorry, Motoko.

3256
03:37:32,110 --> 03:37:33,110
I always get her name wrong.

3257
03:37:33,270 --> 03:37:33,750
I'm so sorry.

3258
03:37:34,790 --> 03:37:36,210
Fake Ghost in the Shell fan.

3259
03:37:36,450 --> 03:37:37,390
Look at this, though.

3260
03:37:38,350 --> 03:37:39,210
Look at it.

3261
03:37:39,330 --> 03:37:39,790
Wow.

3262
03:37:43,930 --> 03:37:45,410
It looks so good.

3263
03:37:45,430 --> 03:37:47,130
Good, so good.

3264
03:37:49,630 --> 03:37:50,030
Wow.

3265
03:37:50,670 --> 03:37:51,970
It's so cool.

3266
03:37:53,110 --> 03:37:53,630
Wow.

3267
03:37:54,530 --> 03:37:56,690
I'm like obsessed with it.

3268
03:37:58,590 --> 03:38:00,910
I only watched Standalone Complex, though.

3269
03:38:02,830 --> 03:38:04,430
I haven't watched any of the new stuff.

3270
03:38:07,680 --> 03:38:10,260
And that looks like older art, too.

3271
03:38:10,380 --> 03:38:13,460
But I think there was a new anime that adapted the older art, no?

3272
03:38:14,860 --> 03:38:15,120
What?

3273
03:38:15,120 --> 03:38:15,580
That's so bad.

3274
03:38:15,640 --> 03:38:16,480
I love Ghosts in the Shell.

3275
03:38:16,640 --> 03:38:16,880
Yeah.

3276
03:38:19,720 --> 03:38:21,960
Watch the movies, yeah?

3277
03:38:28,160 --> 03:38:29,600
Old movies are good.

3278
03:38:30,700 --> 03:38:34,060
Maybe I did watch them, though, but, like, a long, long time ago.

3279
03:38:35,820 --> 03:38:37,020
When I was a kid.

3280
03:38:39,720 --> 03:38:46,220
But standalone complex, opening still one of the best anime openings, in my opinion.

3281
03:38:47,160 --> 03:38:50,060
Okay, I am going to...

3282
03:38:52,520 --> 03:39:00,200
I'm going to head out now I'm in the middle of watching standalone complex How timely

3283
03:39:03,340 --> 03:39:22,440

3284
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:25,080
I'm going to attempt to make puppets.

3285
03:39:29,820 --> 03:39:32,400
My hair's been purple for the past couple of years.

3286
03:39:32,540 --> 03:39:35,260
I've been inspired by you to finally change it to mid-grid.

3287
03:39:36,360 --> 03:39:37,680
Oh my gosh, Melody!

3288
03:39:38,260 --> 03:39:39,500
It's going to be so beautiful.

3289
03:39:41,660 --> 03:39:42,780

3290
03:39:43,540 --> 03:39:44,640
