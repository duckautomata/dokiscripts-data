00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,950
The chat is too fast.

2
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,130
Oh, jeez.

3
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,290
The chat is too fast.

4
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,690
Hi!

5
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:53,830
Hello!

6
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,330
Why?

7
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,510
Nimi!

8
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,450
Nimi, I was just watching you.

9
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,750
Thank you.

10
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,570
Thank you for the raid.

11
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,990
Thank you so much for the raid, though, right?

12
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,070
Thank you, everybody.

14
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:09,890
Oh, my gosh.

15
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,970
Thank you for all the gifted and the donors and everything.

16
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,410
Holy cow.

17
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,150
Holy cow!

18
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,990
It's been... It's been... It's been... Five years!

19
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,110
Happy Anniversary!

20
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,970
Thank you, Nimi!

21
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,070
Actually, I was like... I had... I was watching you dance.

22
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:36,970
You're so cute.

23
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,970
And I was like, I can't... Even before I was watching it, I was like, I kind of want to sing Love Fool.

24
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,130
Dedicate to my Oshi Nimi nightmare.

25
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,790
So I kind of have a little bit of a set list, but not really.

26
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,830
Just kind of sing whatever I want.

27
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,670
Thank you, guys!

28
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,910
Thank you so much.

29
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,310
Thank you!

30
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,750
It's been a while since I've done karaoke, so I wanted to do some karaoke today.

31
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,910
And... I wanted to... Um...

32
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,330
Uh... I have an announcement!

33
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,850
I have an announcement!

34
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,150
That will be after ten songs!

35
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,230
So we'll get through ten songs, and then I will do the announcement.

36
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,910
And then we'll see how I'm feeling.

37
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,310
If I can sing some more.

38
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,370
And then we will maybe sing some more.

39
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,570
Um...

40
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:23,910
Uh...

41
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,770
What else?

42
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,010
What else?

43
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:25,930
Uh...

44
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,230
I also... There was...

45
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,370
There was one thing I also wanted to watch together.

46
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:31,810
Or...

47
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,850
Less of a watch, more of a listen.

48
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,310
Um...

49
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,130
Maybe we'll do that after five songs.

50
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,910
Oh my gosh, someone...

51
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,350
The chat is great!

52
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,010
Thank you, guys!

53
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,630
Thank you, thank you!

54
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,710
Thank you!

55
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,910
Um...

56
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,470
So...

57
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,350
Something a little...

58
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,210
A little...

59
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,070
Because last year, I watched my...

60
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,970
I re-watched my...

61
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,210
My...

62
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,570
Uh...

63
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,550
Not debut...

64
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,170
Well, we did watch my debut a little bit, but my...

65
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,780
Debut video that I put out...

66
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,550
Kami, thank you!

67
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,710
And...

68
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,490
But this year, I have something...

69
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,610
A little...

70
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,670
Interesting...

71
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,710
Maybe for you guys...

72
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,010
That...

73
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,510
Um...

74
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,170
Maybe...

75
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,810
You guys would be like...

76
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:18,950
What?

77
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,690
Huh?

78
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,750
What is this?

79
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,870
We get to hear this?

80
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,810
So...

81
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

82
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,230
If you wanted to see my...

83
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,990
Reaction to my debut video...

84
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,930
You can...

Anniversary stream from last year!

89
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,410
But don't go yet!

90
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:39,590
What?

91
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,950
Obviously...

92
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,630
We're here to sing!

93
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,070
And...

94
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,130
Um...

Yeah!

96
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,190
Oh golly...

I'll put you guys...

98
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,970
On the other side...

99
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,410
Actually, you know what?

100
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,410
I'm gonna do this so I can...

101
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,590
Oop...

102
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,170
My computer is lagging...

103
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,410
Oh gosh...

104
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,870
My computer is lagging!

105
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,410
Okay...

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,280
I do wanna also mention...

107
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,930
Um...

108
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,250
Uh...

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,870
I don't...

110
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,210
Uh...

111
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,090
I...

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,530
Um...

113
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,970
Unfortunately...

114
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,370
Uh...

115
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,950
This...

116
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,150
The stream is kind of all I got...

117
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,870
Um...

118
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,870
The announcement...

119
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,170
Um...

120
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,870
The announcement...

121
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,290
We'll...

122
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:26,390
We'll...

123
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,910
You'll see...

124
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,430
I'll see...

125
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,650
I'll explain later...

126
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,590
But also...

127
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,170
N of want to say...

128
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,490
Um...

129
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,550
Uh...

130
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,070
I wanted to...

131
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,030
Uh...

132
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,570
I don't have like...

133
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,810
Any merch or anything...

134
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,550
So...

135
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,430
Um...

136
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,170
I don't have any merch or anything...

137
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,490
Um...

138
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:41,850
So...

139
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,590
You can...

140
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,410
Rest easy on that...

141
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,410
Um...

142
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,430
But!!!

143
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,350
But I was like...

144
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,010
Hmm...

145
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,170
Maybe I could...

146
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,690
I- Put this kind of thing out for a while now...

147
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:08,070
And, um, uh, so, uh, at, uh, in one hour, about in one hour, the, uh, I will be releasing custom voice packs.

148
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,910
Custom voice packs limited to 100.

149
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,770
Limited to 100.

150
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,930
So, uh, but it won't be, you know, the last time I do it, obviously.

151
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,810
Um, uh, so, um, yes.

152
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,090
Um, I, if, if, if they sell out, I will do more in the future.

153
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:46,750
Um, so, um, you know, towards the hour, I will, uh, we will, we will stop for that.

154
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:55,050
Um, I was, I, everything was, like, not everything, but it was, like, being handled.

155
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:05,610
And then, um, and then, uh, um, what do you mean, if, you don't, you don't even know the price yet.

156
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,670
You haven't seen the price.

157
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,510
Some people might be, like, oh, I want that.

158
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,650
And then see the price and be, like, oh, not worth it.

159
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,970
The price is, the price, they are, they are $50.

160
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,550
So, it's pretty pricey for just, just me talking, no?

161
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,940
Yeah, so, um, then I, um, I went, I was, like, oh, I really wanted to have this.

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,600
I really wanted to do this.

163
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:54,420
So, I, I, um, I, uh, went to Mosso today.

164
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,360
I was, like, Mosso!

165
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,960
Mosso, I know it's kind of crazy, but can you put this together?

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,720
In, like, seven hours.

167
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,520
Small price to pay for Minto voice pack.

168
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,240
Custom voice pack.

169
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,980
So, obviously, obviously, it's, like, safe for work.

170
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:35,580
And, um, you know, uh, uh, I could, I, it could be that, could be that, um, your, you, what you send is not, not, um, okay for me to say.

171
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,820
And so, maybe that you get something that says, hey, that's not okay.

172
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
You need to redo.

173
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,540
But, what do you mean charge more?

174
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,180
Or is it not, it's already so much, no?

175
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,980
I think.

176
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:07,840
But, you can have me do ASMR, or custom, or you could have me do, uh, scenario, or you could have me create your, uh, custom, uh, alarm clock, or...

177
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,380
I charge 69.

178
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,600
Of course you did, Doki.

179
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,720
Hold on, I'm gonna mod you before I forget.

180
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,120
Well, if you come to Mint Phantom Channel, you'll get it cheaper than Doki Birch.

181
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,140
Be a thousand dollars, no way.

182
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,900
But, yeah, so, um, yeah.

183
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,720
Yeah, I really wanted to do them.

184
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,020
So, uh, think, be thinking.

185
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,060
Be thinking.

186
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,420
If you want to try and get one, um, in about 45 minutes.

187
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
That's why I told you guys early.

188
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,360
Oh, gosh.

189
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,040
It's been so long since I've sung.

190
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm scared.

191
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm nervous.

192
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,780
I hope that my voice holds out.

193
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,060
Doki only charge 69 because we tried making her up the price to 100 during stream.

194
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,280
She also started at 50 bucks like you.

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,080
It's because...

196
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,260
I don't know why you guys want to pay more money.

197
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,700
Why do you want to pay more money?

198
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,060
It doesn't make any sense to me.

199
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,020
Actually.

200
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,220
But, I could, you know, like I said, it won't be the last time I do it.

201
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:55,400
I could, if, if I don't get so tired from doing them, I could do it, like, you know, in a couple months as well.

202
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,320
For those who want to try.

203
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,820
Yes.

204
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,800
Make it $69.

205
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,140
And one cent.

206
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,880
So, yeah.

207
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,800
Five years.

208
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,720
I was gone for a couple of those years.

209
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,400
I apologize.

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,120
Maybe it's...

211
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,440
Maybe it's not fair for me to celebrate five years.

212
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,360
But I don't care.

213
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,960
I don't care.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,160
$69.69.

215
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay, that's what you will price next time, Doki.

216
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,220
I can celebrate five years if I want to.

217
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,160
It's been five years, so...

218
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,080
It's fair?

219
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,040
Five years is five years.

220
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,740
Exactly.

221
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,180
Exactly.

222
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,580
So, I don't care.

223
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,380
Oh, gosh.

224
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,620
A lot has happened, huh?

225
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,300
Um...

226
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,080
I'm not gonna lie.

227
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,360
I was, like, thinking of songs to sing.

228
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,640
And...

229
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,440
I was like, I'm gonna...

230
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,160
They all ended up being, like, really depressing.

231
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,600
Because it was, like...

232
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
It was, like...

233
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh...

234
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,680
You know how, like, you want to sing sometimes?

235
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,340
How you feel?

236
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,180
So...

237
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,960
Oh, my gosh.

238
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
Thank you, guys, for...

239
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,820
The super chance.

240
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Thank you, bro.

241
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,660
Guys, super, thank you.

242
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,500
Even if you don't want us...

243
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,680
Don't want us to acknowledge how good...

244
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,340
You please mentally assign us as insane.

245
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah, you guys are insane.

246
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,760
That's okay.

247
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,080
Something...

248
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,420
What is it?

249
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,400
Like...

250
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,420
Streamer?

251
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,420
Like...

252
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,960
Chat?

253
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,080
Um...

254
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,580
Yeah.

255
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,440
Yeah.

256
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:03,740
So...

257
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,900
And, guys!

258
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,860
Oh, my gosh.

259
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, my gosh.

260
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,380
Oh, my gosh.

261
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,980
Oh, my gosh.

262
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,320
We are only 10K away...

263
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,400
From 400K?

264
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,960
That's exciting.

265
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,620
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

266
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,660
Wowie, wowie.

267
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh, my gosh.

268
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,360
Oh, my...

269
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,420
Oh, yay!

270
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,940
Yippee!

271
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,420
Only 10K more!

272
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,460
400K.

273
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,700
Hope everything starts getting better...

274
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,400
And going your way soon.

275
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,220
Thank you.

276
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

277
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,540
Thank you, thank you.

278
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
Thank you, guys.

279
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,060
Thank you for all that you do.

280
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,920
Thank you.

281
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,860
You guys are...

282
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,580
Thank you.

283
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,520
Should we sing?

284
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,300
Let's sing.

285
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,040
Let's sing before I get too nervous about it.

286
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,020
I'm like...

287
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,020
I'm starting to shake a little bit.

288
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm nervous.

289
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm so nervous.

290
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,100
Oh, I see.

291
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,660
I thank you so much, you guys, as well for the donors in Streamlabs.

292
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,540
I do see them.

293
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,620
I do see them.

294
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,700
But I think they're going to be lost in the sauce for a minute.

295
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,020
From all the Super Chats and members and stuff.

296
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,980
But what I am going to do is let me turn off the sound for those.

297
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,140
Because I am viewing them.

298
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,220
Thank you so much.

299
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,920
Thank you.

300
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,060
Where should we start with?

301
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,800
Oh, wait.

302
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,180
I want to start.

303
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,020
I think I know.

304
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,300
I think I know.

305
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,560
Oh, alert box.

306
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,580
Give me one moment to turn off...

307
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,460
The sound.

308
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,460
I apologize.

309
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,700
I apologize.

310
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:51,860
I apologize.

311
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,100
Huh?

312
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:54,960
Wait.

313
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,300
Huh?

314
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,060
Huh?

315
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,640
Wait.

316
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,780
Do I have to do each one?

317
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,340
Let me...

318
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,560
Okay.

319
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,340
I think so.

320
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,180
Save setting.

321
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,820
I'll readjust these later.

322
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,580
Save setting.

323
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,420
I should probably write down what they were at, but...

324
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,180
Whatever.

325
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,180
Save setting.

326
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,600
Oh, that's why it was so loud.

327
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,080
Save setting.

328
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,080
Save setting.

329
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Save setting.

330
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,460
Minky, minky, minky, minky.

331
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,380
Save setting.

332
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,060
Okay.

333
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,400
Okay.

334
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,210
Nervous.

335
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,390
Okay.

336
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,060
Wait.

337
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,460
Sorry.

338
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:04,880
Hold on.

339
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Oh, that's why.

340
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,700
I was like, huh.

341
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
There's no space.

342
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,560
Okay.

343
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,720
I've never sung this song before.

344
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,060
But this one's for my Oshin.

345
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,320
Who's very cute and dances.

346
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,400
She dances well, of course.

347
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,420
But it was also so cute and silly.

348
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,920
Okay.

349
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,020
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem.

350
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,980
You love me no longer, I know.

351
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:57,440
And maybe there is nothing that I can do to make you do.

352
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,220
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother.

353
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,160
That I ought to stick to another man.

354
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,140
A man that surely deserves me.

355
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,560
I, I think you do.

356
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,080
So, I cry.

357
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,460
Love me, love me.

358
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,880
Say that you love me.

359
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,800
Fool me, fool me.

360
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,200
Go on and fool me.

361
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,020
Love me, love me.

362
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,480
Pretend that you love me.

363
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,380
Leave me, leave me.

364
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,820
Just say that you need me.

365
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,980
Oh.

366
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,020
Oh.

367
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,320
And I beg for you to love me, love me.

368
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,760
Say that you love me.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,540
Leave me, leave me.

370
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,000
Just say that you need me.

371
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,300
I can't care about anything but you.

372
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:35,850
Lately I have desperately pondered Spent my nights awake and I wonder What I could have done in another way To make you stay Reason will not lead to solution I will end up lost in confusion I don't care if you really care, as long as you don't go.

373
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,610
So I cry, I pray and I beg.

374
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,390
Love me, love me, say that you love me.

375
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,690
Fool me, fool me, just go on and fool me.

376
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,950
Love me, love me, pretend that you love me.

377
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,330
Leave me, leave me, just say that you need me.

378
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:07,930
So I cry, and I beg for you too.

379
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,250
Love me, love me, say that you love me.

380
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,510
Leave me, leave me, just say that you need me.

381
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,830
I can't care about anything but you.

382
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,930
Love me, love me, say that you love me.

383
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,130
Fool me, fool me, just go on and fool me.

384
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,430
Love me, love me, I know that you need me.

385
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,310
I can't care about anything but you.

386
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,670
Love me, love me, say that you love me.

387
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:50,950
Hey,

388
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,200
dramatic zoom.

389
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,920
Why is it, why is it here?

390
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,280
Hello?

391
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:01,840
Yay!

392
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:04,730
Yay!

393
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,110
I, wait.

394
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,470
Oh, la-la-la-la.

395
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,210
Love?

396
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,660
That was my ending fairy.

397
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,760
Little wink.

398
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,420
Wait, hold on.

399
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,870
You know when it gets all close and like...

400
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,850
After a performance.

401
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,290
Wait, it's lingering too long.

402
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,630
I'm getting embarrassed.

403
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,690
Yay!

404
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,390
Yeah, yeah, first song down.

405
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:37,790
Okay.

406
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,510
That was a good...

407
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,810
That was a good, that was a good warm-up.

408
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,840
Selfishly sending this so I can enjoy my favorite mug again.

409
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
Wait, what do you mean favorite mug?

410
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,840
Some people were asking for me to re-release the mugs.

411
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,540
I can try.

412
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,480
I can try, I can try.

413
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,800
There's been a lot, it's been...

414
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,580
It's been actually like so...

415
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,980
So overwhelming because it's been...

416
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
It's been...

417
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,480
Like...

418
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,620
Oh gosh.

419
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,710
So, so many people have been reaching out about...

420
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,820
About, you know, the idol group.

421
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,860
And about, you know, if I still wanted to join an agency or anything.

422
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,520
And about...

423
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,620
My merch.

424
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,760
And I posted on Twitter like a prototype of something that...

425
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,520
Uh...

426
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,820
I was like, oh...

427
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,520
Sucks that this won't be made now.

428
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,700
But I got so many people being like...

429
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,780
Do you, do you need help?

430
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,620
Do you...

431
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
So I'm...

432
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,620
It's been really...

433
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,600
Overwhelming.

434
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,740
Sorry, I'm trying not to cry.

435
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,000
But in a good way.

436
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,600
Because so many people have reached out.

437
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,120
And...

438
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,360
It's really nice.

439
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,840
Okay.

440
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,560
So...

441
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,480
So many, so many, so many of my friends.

443
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,160
I'm really grateful.

444
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,180
What should I sing next?

445
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,900
Oh wait!

446
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,180
Actually, I heard this one.

447
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,620
On Nimi's stream too.

448
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,020
Sorry.

449
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,080
I'm so obsessed with her.

450
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,340
I hope she's not still here.

451
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,090
This one.

452
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:43,870
I heard too.

453
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,700
She's into superstitions.

454
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,160
Black cats and voodoo dolls.

455
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,330
I feel a premonition.

456
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,540
That girl's gonna make me fall.

457
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,660
She's into new sensations.

458
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,380
New kicks in the candlelight.

459
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,980
She's got a new addiction.

460
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,720
For everyday and night.

461
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,980
She'll make you take your clothes off.

462
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,260
And go dancing in the rain.

463
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,680
She'll make you live your crazy life.

464
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,940
But she'll take away your pain.

465
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,500
Like a bullet to your brain.

466
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,300
Come on!

467
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,020
Upside, inside, out.

468
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,960
She's living la vida loca.

469
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,420
She'll push and pull you down.

470
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,380
Living la vida loca.

471
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,700
Her lips are devil red.

472
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
And her skin's the color of mocha.

473
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,320
She will wear you out.

474
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,180
Living la vida loca.

475
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,840
Living la vida loca.

476
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,560
Living la vida loca.

477
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,240
Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap hotel.

478
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,200
She took my heart and she took my money.

479
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,760
She must have sent me a sleeping pill.

480
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,360
She never drinks the water, makes you order French champagne.

481
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,060
Once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same.

482
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Yeah, she'll make you go insane.

483
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,040
Upside, inside, out.

484
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,060
She's living la vida loca.

485
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,540
She'll push and pull you down.

486
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,480
Living la vida loca.

487
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,000
Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color of mocha.

488
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,300
She will wear you out.

489
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,340
Living la vida loca.

490
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,940
Living la vida loca.

491
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,660
She's living la vida loca.

492
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,820
She'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain.

493
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,140
She'll make you live her crazy life.

494
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,500
But she'll take away your pain.

495
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,920
Like a bullet to your brain.

496
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,640
Come on!

497
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,400
Upside, inside, out.

498
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,400
She's living la vida loca.

499
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,760
She'll push and pull you down.

500
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,780
Living la vida loca.

501
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,340
Her lips are devil red and her skin's the color of mocha.

502
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,660
She will wear you out.

503
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,620
Living la vida loca.

504
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,940
Living la vida loca.

505
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,400
Living la vida loca.

506
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,940
She's living la vida loca.

507
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,200
She's living la vida loca.

508
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,840
She's living la vida loca.

509
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,000
She's living la vida loca.

510
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,660
She's living la vida loca.

511
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,380
She's living la vida loca.

512
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
She's living la vida loca.

513
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,560
She's living la vida loca.

514
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,040
I know this part.

515
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,800
Come on!

516
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,320
I know this part.

517
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Oh,

518
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,880
my ending fairy.

519
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Wait.

520
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,400
Zoom in.

521
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,400
Zoom.

522
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,460
Zoom in.

523
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,400
Never mind, I give up.

524
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,100
Bam.

525
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,880
Yeah!

526
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,160
Livin' la vida loca.

527
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,220
The dance actually looks so fun for that.

528
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,380
Livin' la vida loca.

529
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,340
Once I have my 3D debut, I want to also do...

530
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,580
Just Dance.

531
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,560
It looks fun.

532
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,640
It looks so fun.

533
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,520
Reverb!

534
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:24,880
Oh!

535
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,200
I forgot.

536
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,400
Okay.

537
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,620
We'll do this one.

538
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,000
This next one's kind of sad, though.

539
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,660
We'll do reverb on this one.

540
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,580
We'll do reverb on this one.

541
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,320
Enhance.

542
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,120
Ah, ah, ah.

543
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,200
Ah!

544
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,420
Oh, it starts immediately.

545
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:58,840
Hold on.

546
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

547
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,080
Chill.

548
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,940
Chill, chill, chill.

549
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,600
How's the audio, by the way?

550
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,720
School bag in hand.

551
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,400
School bag in hand.

552
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,120
She leaves home in early morning.

553
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,860
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile.

554
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,820
I watch her go with the surge of that well-known sadness.

555
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,620
And I have to sit down for a while.

556
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:45,920
The feeling that I'm losing her forever.

557
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,400
The feeling that I'm losing her forever.

558
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,240
And without really entering the world.

559
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,180
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter.

560
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,700
The funny little girl.

561
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,940
The funny little girl.

562
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,580
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

563
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,400
I try to capture every minute.

564
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,900
The feeling in it.

565
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,240
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

566
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:19,840
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

567
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,400
Do I really see what's in her mind?

568
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,200
Each time I think.

569
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm close to knowing.

570
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,580
She keeps on growing.

571
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

572
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,660
Sleep in our eyes.

573
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,160
Her and me.

574
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,980
At the breakfast table.

575
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,340
Barely awake.

576
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,280
I let precious time go by.

577
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,320
Then when she's gone.

578
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,480
There's that odd.

579
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,780
Melancholy feeling.

580
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,860
And a sense of guilt I can't deny.

581
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,060
What happened to the wonderful adventures?

582
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,320
The places I had planned to go.

583
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,940
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

584
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,100
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

585
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,180
For some of that we did.

586
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,600
But most we didn't.

587
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,700
And why?

588
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,120
I just don't know.

589
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,700
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

590
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,520
I try to capture every minute.

591
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,140
The feeling in it.

592
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

593
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,640
Do I really see what's in her mind?

594
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,540
Each time I think.

595
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,520
I'm close to knowing.

596
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,960
She keeps on growing.

597
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:54,700
She keeps on growing.

598
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,360
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

599
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,980
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture.

600
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,820
And save it from the funny trace of time.

601
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,620
Slipping through my fingers.

602
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,860
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

603
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,040
Slipping through my fingers all the time.

604
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,640
School bag in hand.

605
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,540
She leaves home in the early morning.

606
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,860
Waving goodbye.

607
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,640
With an absent-minded smile.

608
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,980
Speaking of ABBA.

609
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,520
Feel this song recently.

610
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,370
I don't wanna talk.

611
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,970
About the things we've gone through.

612
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,450
Though it's hurting me.

613
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:57,030
Now it's history.

614
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,050
Now it's history.

615
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,660
I've played all my cards.

616
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,550
And that's what you've done too.

617
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,310
Nothing more to say.

618
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,210
No more ace to play.

619
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,490
The winner takes it all.

620
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,210
The loser standing small.

621
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,730
Beside the victory.

622
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,010
Beside the victory.

623
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,290
That's her destiny.

624
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,050
I was in your arms.

625
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,850
Thinking I belonged there.

626
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,670
I figured it made sense.

627
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,230
Building me a fence.

628
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,790
Building me a home.

629
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,130
Thinking I'd be strong there.

630
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,150
Thinking I'd be strong there.

631
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,710
But I was a fool.

632
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,030
Playing by the rules.

633
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,130
The gods made throw a dice.

634
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,710
Their minds as cold as ice.

635
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,630
And someone way down here.

636
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,530
Loses someone dear.

637
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,770
The winner takes it all.

638
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,230
The loser has to fall.

639
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,210
It's simple and it's plain.

640
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,550
Why should I complain?

641
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:29,710
Why should I complain?

642
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,550
Why should I complain?

643
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,750
Tell me, does she kiss?

644
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,610
Like I used to kiss you.

645
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,290
Does it feel the same?

646
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,070
When she calls your name.

647
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,470
When she calls your name.

648
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,650
Somewhere deep inside.

649
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,890
You must know I miss him.

650
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,550
But what can I say?

651
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,370
Rules must be obeyed.

652
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,470
The judges will decide.

653
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,370
The likes of me abide.

654
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,970
Spectators of the show.

655
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,450
Always staying low.

656
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,410
The game is on again.

657
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,010
A lover or a friend.

658
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,710
A big thing or a small.

659
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,210
The winner takes it all.

660
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,770
The winner takes it all.

661
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,890
I don't wanna talk.

662
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,370
If it makes me feel sad.

663
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,210
And I understand.

664
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,050
You've come to shake my hand.

665
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,710
I apologize.

666
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,650
If it makes you feel bad.

667
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,470
Seeing me so tense.

668
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,890
No self confidence.

669
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,830
But you see.

670
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,290
The winner takes it all.

671
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,150
The winner takes it all.

672
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:21,050
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

673
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,530
So the winner takes it all.

674
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,030
So the winner takes it all.

675
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:35,070
And the loser has to fall.

676
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:46,810
Cold as ice, way down here.

677
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,910
Someone dear, takes it all.

678
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,630
Has to fall.

679
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,870
It seems plain.

680
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,710
Why complain?

681
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,680
Yeah!

682
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,920
Ain't that life?

683
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,380
Or afterlife if it's my situation.

684
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,960
Or ABBA moment.

685
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,720
ABBA moment!

686
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,520
Yeah!

687
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

688
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

689
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:35,980
Baby!

690
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,140
Let's see.

691
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,180
What else should we sing?

692
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:41,800
Hom,

693
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,820
hom, hom!

694
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,560
Thank you, guys!

695
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,040
Thank you!

696
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

697
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,080
Let's do one more.

698
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,160
Oh, thank you so much!

699
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,380
For the store's picture plans are snake figurines!

700
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,940
I will!

701
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,920
Melodies of Life.

702
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,540
Oh, you know what?

703
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,420
That's a really good one.

704
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,840
You know I'm a sucker for Final Fantasy music.

705
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,730
I'm not out of songs, by the way, that I want to sing, so...

706
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,430
Melodies of Life.

707
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,810
I'm not exactly taking requests, but...

708
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,990
I just happened to spot that one.

709
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,990
Is this in Nihongo?

710
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,070
Probably.

711
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,370
Actually, wait, what's that other one?

712
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,550
What's...

713
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,530
What's the other...

714
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,650
I can't remember.

715
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,930
What if I DM you my request?

716
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,270
Okay.

717
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,030
I'm scared.

718
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,030
Do it.

719
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:56,650
DM.

720
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,570
DM, my DMs are open.

721
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,940
Oh my gosh, Mosso just messaged me instead of beefing up the servers.

722
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,400
I don't know it!

723
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,260
I don't know it!

724
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,020
I don't know!

725
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,860
Wait.

726
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,020
Let me see if they have it.

727
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,900
On here.

728
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,160
Why is it giving me panic at the disco?

729
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,460
I don't know it!

730
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,080
Oh, wait!

731
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,160
Featured.

732
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
It's not on here.

733
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,460
I don't know it.

734
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:35,780
Okay.

735
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,620
Five Nights at Freddy's.

736
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,360
Oh my gosh, did you guys see the Five Nights at Freddy's 2 trailer?

737
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,000
I agree with everyone asking for...

738
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,980
Eyes on me!

739
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,640
That's the one.

740
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,800
That's the one that I was thinking of.

741
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Sorry, Melodies of Life.

742
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,460
Did you guys see it?

743
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,500
The FNAF 2 trailer?

744
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,700
And actually...

745
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,040
I asked for Discord.

746
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,480
Fine, I will do Discord.

747
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,820
I'll try it.

748
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,880
I don't know it.

749
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,180
Sorry, I was a fake brownie.

750
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,220
Is there even a...

751
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:12,940
There's gotta be.

752
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,400
Oh, karaoke!

753
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:13,960
Here we go.

754
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,340
Okay.

755
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,500
This is me singing Discord when I don't know Discord at all.

756
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,260
Okay, here we go.

757
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,940
Oh my god.

758
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,700
It's so loud.

759
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,100
Holy cow.

760
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,460
I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I...

761
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:31,580
Wait.

762
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,400
Oh, it's so fast.

763
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,680
Something terrible is going down through the entire town.

764
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,900
Wrecking iron and it's bing, bing.

765
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,540
I can't sit idly...

766
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,420
I can't move at all.

767
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,720
I curse the name.

768
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,720
The worm behind it all.

769
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,020
Discord!

770
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,120
I'm howling at the moon.

771
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,820
And I'm sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon.

772
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,540
Discord!

773
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,920
Whatever did we do to make...

774
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,320
Do we take our world away?

775
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,140
Discord!

776
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,920
Are we putting your payload or are we stepping stone to take back the throne?

777
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:00,700
Discord!

778
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:00,860
Discord!

779
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,860
We won't take it anymore, so take your tyranny away!

780
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,670
Oh yeah.

781
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,330
This is for Doki Bird.

782
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,290
This is exactly how she asked me to sing it as well.

783
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,650
I'm fine with changing status quo.

784
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,810
I'm not letting go in the world that we detored apart.

785
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,410
A terrible catastrophe played by a symphony.

786
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,990
What a terrifying work of art.

787
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,930
I can't sit idly.

788
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,910
No, I can't move at all.

789
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,070
I curse the name.

790
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,430
The worm behind it all.

791
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:41,750
Doki!

792
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,190
I'm howling at the moon.

793
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,470
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon.

794
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:46,350
Doki!

795
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,370
Whatever did we do to make you take our world away?

796
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:50,890
Doki!

797
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,470
Are we your prey alone or are we just stepping stone?

798
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,730
How close am I to the original?

799
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,230
Am I close

800
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,900
at the...

801
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,820
Very

802
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,140
close.

803
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:17,960
Like 30%.

804
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,720
Doki, I'm howling at the moon.

805
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,920
And I'm sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon.

806
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:22,900
Doki!

807
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,140
Whatever did we do to make you take away our world...

808
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,240
Wait.

809
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,480
Oh.

810
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,920
Doki!

811
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,320
Or are we just stepping stone for you to take by the throne?

812
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:31,960
Doki!

813
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,420
We won't take it anymore.

814
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,240
So take your tyranny away!

815
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,600
Doki!

816
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,260
Oh, it's over.

817
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:37,740
Just kidding.

818
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,860
I thought there was another chorus.

819
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,600
That was Discord.

820
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,680
DokiBird version.

821
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:48,800
DokiBird version.

822
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,880
So happy for that.

823
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,060
I hope you guys like that.

824
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,880
Check DMs real quick.

825
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,340
Oh, okay.

826
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:10,060
Why does it sound like werewolf bar mitzvah?

827
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,560
Spooky scary.

828
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,800
Boys becoming men.

829
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,540
Men becoming wolves.

830
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,670
Why does she say...

831
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,550
She said that it sounded like I was singing...

832
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,590
It sounds like werewolf bar mitzvah when I say it.

833
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,190
It literally sounds...

834
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,270
Werewolf bar mitzvah.

835
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,690
Spooky scary.

836
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,270
Thank you.

837
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,390
What a reference.

838
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,530
Maybe, I don't know.

839
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,750
I started singing it.

840
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,390
In my mind, I was channeling Hamlet.

841
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,510
I've never seen Hamlet.

842
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,090
But that's what I was channeling.

843
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,040
Can you vlog DokiBird on Discord real quick, right?

844
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,010
Okay.

845
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,530
I feel like I need to...

846
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,730
Not do a serious song like Eyes on You.

847
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,450
I need to like...

848
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,630
Have a buffer, you know?

849
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,850
Oh, what's another one?

850
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:30,870
Oh, what's a buffer?

851
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:32,650
Hold on.

852
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,850
I'm going to put some music back on.

853
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,770
Well, I think...

854
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:34,870
Oh!

855
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,450
We had 10 minutes.

856
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,070
Oh, okay.

857
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,370
Cool.

858
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,910
10 minutes before...

859
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:39,790
The...

860
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:40,970
The...

861
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:42,490
Custom voice packs go up.

862
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,350
For those who don't know.

863
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,610
I should say again.

864
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,470
Oh, wait.

865
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,910
I have custom voice packs.

866
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,410
That will be on sale.

867
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,230
Mosso box.

868
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,410
The...

869
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,430
There's a link in the description.

870
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,670
Under...

871
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,570
Into Merch.

872
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:55,550
Area.

873
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:56,870
And...

874
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:57,870
Actually, you know what?

875
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:58,750
I should just post the link.

876
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,110
I should just pin the link.

877
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:02,310
Um...

878
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:03,090
One moment, please.

879
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,410
One moment, please.

880
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:09,490
Oh.

881
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,410
My YouTube crashed.

882
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:10,630
Oh.

883
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:10,970
Nope.

884
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:11,590
Oh gosh.

885
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,610
I think my computer's crashing.

886
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,290
I don't know why.

887
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:14,970
Some...

888
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,570
Are you guys still here?

889
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:19,190
Am I crashed?

890
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,130
Oh, you guys are still here.

891
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:20,330
Okay.

892
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,250
My...

893
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,090
Everything has...

894
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:24,530
Oh gosh.

895
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,490
YouTube has crashed.

896
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,610
Hold on.

897
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,670
I might just read you guys through OBS.

898
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,560
One moment.

899
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:53,880
Sorry.

900
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,640
This is taking forever.

901
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,020
Custom voice pack.

902
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,700
Custom voice pack.

903
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,430
Limited to...

904
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,140
Limited to...

905
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,160
100.

906
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,940
For this time.

907
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,320
There we go.

908
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,080
But don't go yet.

909
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,070
Not yet.

910
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,090
K-pop demon hunters.

911
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:25,550
Oh my gosh.

912
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,990
I tried singing Golden.

913
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,330
That's the only song I know.

914
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,690
But it's...

915
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:30,870
It's hard.

916
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,390
That song is hard.

917
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,250
Thank tribute to everyone's favorite.

918
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,350
Free smart audiobooks.

919
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,150
I'm really...

920
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,720
I also don't know...

921
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,100
Golden so well.

922
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,940
Like I only know the...

923
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,480
Hold on.

924
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,600
I wonder if they even have it.

925
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:48,420
Golden.

926
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,090
I feel like they would.

927
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,710
Wait.

928
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,270
They have free?

929
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:00,810
Oh.

930
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:01,630
What'd they do?

931
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:02,270
Oh my gosh.

932
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:02,530
Wait.

933
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,470
But I don't know like the beginning.

934
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,830
I only know the chorus.

935
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,850
Can I just sing the chorus?

936
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,340
I could try.

937
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,060
Oh gosh.

938
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,540
I don't know the song either.

939
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,600
Wait.

940
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,720
Is there like a lead vocal?

941
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,620
There might be.

942
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,070
Oh it's...

943
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,930
That's Korean.

944
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:28,930
I can't even read that.

945
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,210
I can't read that.

946
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,010
It's like actual.

947
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,450
I didn't know...

948
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,590
How to believe...

949
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,370
I was the queen that was meant to be.

950
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:39,990
I lived in two lives.

951
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,970
Tried to play both sides.

952
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:45,370
But I couldn't find my own place.

953
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,710
I found a problem child.

954
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,770
Cause I got too wild.

955
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,730
That's how I'm getting paid.

956
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:53,330
Oh gosh.

957
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,110
It's in Korean.

958
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:55,990
I'm done hiding.

959
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,970
I'm shining.

960
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,470
Like I'm born to be.

961
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,610
We're dreaming hard.

962
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,770
We came so far now.

963
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,230
I believe...

964
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,010
I believe...

965
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,230
We're going up, up, up.

966
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,510
It's our moment.

967
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,310
You know together we're glowing.

968
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:15,590
Gonna bring good

969
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,140
voices.

970
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,040
Oh, something in Korean.

971
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,060
Gonna be, gonna be golden.

972
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,160
Oh, I'm done hiding.

973
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,080
Now I'm shining.

974
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,380
Like I'm born to be.

975
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:31,720
Oh gosh.

976
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,460
I can't hit that note.

977
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,700
I have no fear.

978
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,360
That's who we're born to be.

979
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,880
This song is so hard.

980
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,720
What the hell?

981
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,580
For no reason.

982
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,560
Good guys.

983
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,740
In Korean.

984
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,940
I can't read it.

985
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,090
Just like in the movie?

986
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,310
Wait, does that happen?

987
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,890
Does she not hit the note in the movie too?

988
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,810
That's crazy.

989
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,350
Because it's such a hard song.

990
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,110
And then it's also...

991
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:05,710
Oh my god.

992
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,250
Like the song is not kind to anybody.

993
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,510
Like, I mean...

994
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,250
Because it goes so deep.

995
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,750
And then it goes so high.

996
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:15,750
Holy cow.

997
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,470
Watch the movie.

998
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,130
What's it on?

999
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,210
It's on...

1000
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,430
I haven't...

1001
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,310
You're by Kamiyoshi.

1002
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,910
Thank you.

1003
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,140
Oh, what's another song?

1004
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,340
Actually, it's...

1005
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,200
I fear that my voice has...

1006
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,320
Not...

1007
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,220
I fear...

1008
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,760
Rather, I have to train my voice to do high notes again.

1009
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,620
It's on Netflix.

1010
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,380
Oh, okay.

1011
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,360
I fear that I have to retrain my voice to do high notes.

1012
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,780
Because...

1013
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,500
I've noticed that I...

1014
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,480
I...

1015
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,340
I think since I had so much damage, it kind of...

1016
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,480
Um...

1017
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,240
Owl City!

1018
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,120
Oh my gosh, wait.

1019
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,760
I have another song I'm going to do by Owl City.

1020
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,280
Is it okay?

1021
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:05,660
Okay?

1022
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:07,900
Yeah.

1023
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,960
So I will...

1024
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,540
I will be practicing.

1025
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,720
Practicing, practicing.

1026
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,560
Wait.

1027
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,000
I wonder if there's a karaoke of this.

1028
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,080
Oh...

1029
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:25,320
Wait.

1030
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:25,820
Hold on.

1031
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,020
I can probably find her on YouTube.

1032
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,700
Um...

1033
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,880
Maybe this.

1034
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,400
Oh.

1035
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,060
Hmm?

1036
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,000
Uh...

1037
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,480
I don't know.

1038
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,500
Uh...

1039
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,480
I'll try this one.

1040
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh god.

1041
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,980
The quality is terrible.

1042
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,740
Hold on.

1043
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,280
Maybe...

1044
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:48,860
Maybe...

1045
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,720
This?

1046
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Wait, don't...

1047
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,260
Isn't there overlapping voices in this song?

1048
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,920
Ah, that's fine.

1049
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,040
I

1050
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:24,720
opened my eyes, last night, and saw you in the low light, walking down by the bay, on the shore, staring up at the stars that weren't there anymore.

1051
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:35,800
I was feeling the night grow old, and you were looking so cold, like an introvert.

1052
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:54,900
I drew my over shirt, around my arms, and began to shiver violently before you happened to look and see the tunnels all around me, running into the dark underground.

1053
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:03,940
All the subways around, all the subways around, create a great sound, to my motion critique, farewell.

1054
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:17,180
With your ear to a seashell, you can hear the waves, and underwater caves, as if you actually were inside a saltwater room.

1055
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:27,480
Time together isn't ever quite enough, when you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home.

1056
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,000
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?

1057
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,800
Can you believe that the crew has gone?

1058
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,640
They wouldn't let me sign on.

1059
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:52,900
All my islands have sung in the deep, and I can hardly relax or even oversleep.

1060
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,740
But I feel warm with your hand in mine.

1061
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:05,720
When we walk along the shoreline, I guess we'll never know, why sparrows love the snow.

1062
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,560
We'll turn off all of the lights, and set this ballroom aglow.

1063
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,320
But time together isn't ever quite enough,

1064
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,180
this hint of love.

1065
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,740
Why does it feel so alone?

1066
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,180
So tell me, darling, do you wish...

1067
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,070
All the time...

1068
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,820
Oh, all the time...

1069
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,210
This song's hard to sing with one person.

1070
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,130
That was...

1071
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,310
That was...

1072
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,730
The Saltwater Room!

1073
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:57,190
By Owl City.

1074
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:58,990
Yes, yes.

1075
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:03,010
Well, we have two minutes until...

1076
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:04,690
Until...

1077
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,990
Uh, the custom voice...

1078
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:07,930
Packs drop!

1079
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:09,430
I'll turn music back on.

1080
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:11,810
And...

1081
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:12,990
And, um...

1082
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,230
And, uh...

1083
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,590
After that, we're gonna watch something.

1084
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,190
It's really listen to something.

1085
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,770
But, well, watch, listen.

1086
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:21,570
My merch shift, let's go!

1087
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:22,190
Yay!

1088
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:22,270
Yay!

1089
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,010
So hopefully you guys, uh, thought long and hard about...

1090
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,190
What you want me to say...

1091
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,190
I could say...

1092
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:34,570
Any...

1093
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,170
Oh, oh, I just realized the thing is still on.

1094
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:36,510
Sorry.

1095
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:38,350
Uh...

1096
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,090
Camera!

1097
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:39,730
Ah!

1098
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,190
I could say...

1099
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,470
Encouraging words!

1100
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,230
Or...

1101
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:47,490
Yeah, MGS memes!

1102
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:50,650
Anything...

1103
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,850
That is within...

1104
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,490
That is...

1105
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,770
Anything asterisk.

1106
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,190
Thank you so much!

1107
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,990
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1108
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,110
Odoriko!

1109
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,250
Okay, add that to the list.

1110
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,720
So...

1111
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,580
Hmm...

1112
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,140
I could...

1113
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,620
I could...

1114
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,740
I could actually do your...

1115
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,620
If you're just like...

1116
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,080
Uh...

1117
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,800
I like Minto, but she's just not enough of a maid.

1118
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,540
You could...

1119
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,460
Fulfill your maid fantasies!

1120
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,700
You know...

1121
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,100
Whatever...

1122
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,750
Indiana Jones...

1123
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,300
Yeah...

1124
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:48,920
Okay...

1125
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,560
Oh gosh...

1126
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,760
I'm nervous...

1127
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,160
Okay...

1128
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,020
Five...

1129
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:53,960
Four...

1130
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:54,860
Three...

1131
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,500
Two...

1132
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:57,510
Okay...

1133
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,190
They should be up!

1134
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,890
They should be up!

1135
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm gonna check too...

1136
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,450
Face off out!

1137
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,470
Just kidding...

1138
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:08,670
I'm refreshing...

1139
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:11,790
I'm refreshing...

1140
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,770
Can we ask her...

1141
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:14,530
Custom voice back...

1142
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,050
Of you just...

1143
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,330
Badly butchering...

1144
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,290
Cheesy pickup lines...

1145
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,490
You could ask for that!

1146
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,250
Ah...

1147
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,370
Why isn't it loading?

1148
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,030
Is

1149
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:33,940
it up?

1150
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,860
Oh wait...

1151
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,440
Okay...

1152
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,160
Hold on...

1153
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,360
Refresh...

1154
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,880
Is...

1155
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,290
Oh...

1156
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,830
Reload!

1157
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:00,770
They said...

1158
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:03,870
Reloading!

1159
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,230
It's up!

1160
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:07,730
It's up!

1161
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:08,250
It's up!

1162
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:09,510
It's up!

1163
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:09,910
It's up!

1164
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:10,410
It's up!

1165
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:12,750
It's up!

1166
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:13,090
It's up!

1167
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,410
It's up!

1168
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:13,730
It's up!

1169
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:14,110
It's up!

1170
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,430
Oh...

1171
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:16,670
Yeah...

1172
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:17,450
It does say...

1173
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:21,630
Their voice pack will be delivered via email by August 31st.

1174
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,570
So give me...

1175
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,990
Give me a little bit of time before...

1176
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:28,010
Before...

1177
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,670
Before you get it, so...

1178
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:35,490
Zero!

1179
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:36,550
Oh my gosh!

1180
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,070
Thank you so much for that!

1181
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,070
For the rainbow, thank you!

1182
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1183
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:44,610
Woooo!

1184
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,590
Mint Phantom...

1185
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,230
Voice... Custom Voice Pack!

1186
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,180
You don't see it?

1187
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,380
Wait, what do you mean you don't see it?

1188
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,080
It's the link here!

1189
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,720
It's here, the link!

1190
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,480
The link...

1191
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,380
The link...

1192
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,000
Huh?

1193
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,280
The link?

1194
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,280
Huh?

1195
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,840
The link?

1196
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,440
The link?

1197
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,640
It's not up!

1198
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,080
It...

1199
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,800
It...

1200
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,220
It...

1201
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,280
Wait, I have a different link in the pinned!

1202
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,620
No way!

1203
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:27,960
This?

1204
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh wait!

1205
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,660
Oh, the one goes to...

1206
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,540
Wait, there you go.

1207
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,270
I thought it would be on the regular store page.

1208
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,670
I'm sorry!

1209
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,850
I didn't realize!

1210
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:55,370
Sorry, sorry!

1211
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,380
Sorry, sorry!

1212
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,280
That was my fault!

1213
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,600
Sorry!

1214
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,500
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1215
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,060
So yeah!

1216
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,600
Um...

1217
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,520
Uh...

1218
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,800
Yeah, requests may be asked to be changed if not appropriate.

1219
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,020
So I will...

1220
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,480
We will send you an email or something.

1221
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,060
And then...

1222
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,740
Please include your request details in your order note.

1223
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:35,800
Sold out!

1224
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:00,530
Maria, you don't have to pay.

1225
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,710
I will just send you anything you want me to say.

1226
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,600
I'm refreshing again, just in case it's...

1227
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,160
Um...

1228
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,300
If you missed out...

1229
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,000
Um...

1230
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,820
Um...

1231
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:23,200
I will also...

1232
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,360
Um...

1233
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,160
I will also...

1234
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,860
Um...

1235
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,140
Um...

1236
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:48,820
Oh, I wish to.

1237
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1238
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:51,220
No worries about that.

1239
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,880
Only do 100...

1240
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,700
To get done, everybody.

1241
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,600
So I'm sorry!

1242
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,200
But, um...

1243
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah.

1244
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,520
No!

1245
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,360
Thank you!

1246
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,980
Thank you for buying that custom voice bag.

1247
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,580
I'm sorry!

1248
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:24,260
I don't have anything else...

1249
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,700
Um...

1250
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,540
Uh...

1251
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,080
For you guys...

1252
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,720
I fear...

1253
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,060
I...

1254
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,580
You know...

1255
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,120
I was fearful that people would...

1256
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,680
Send super chats and stuff.

1257
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,340
And I...

1258
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,180
I have nothing to give back.

1259
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:37,680
So at least even with this...

1260
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,820
I do have my...

1261
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,240
My...

1262
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,120
My voice!

1263
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:40,880
So...

1264
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,220
I have my voice!

1265
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,040
So I can at least...

1266
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:45,460
Uh...

1267
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,420
Talk to you.

1268
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,800
And give that...

1269
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,600
To you.

1270
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,140
So thank you, everybody.

1271
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:54,560
Thank you.

1272
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,100
If you did not give one this time...

1273
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,780
We will...

1274
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,860
There will be another time.

1275
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,880
So do not fret.

1276
01:04:59,120 --> 01:04:59,700
Do not fret.

1277
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,140
Mm-mm-mm.

1278
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,040
Do not fret.

1279
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:08,700
Yes.

1280
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:09,980
Wow!

1281
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,920
I knew!

1282
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,560
Love me too!

1283
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,160
Thank you!

1284
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,160
Thank you, thank you!

1285
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,060
Should we...

1286
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:25,500
Oh, wait.

1287
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,100
I said I wanted to listen to something after this now, right?

1288
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,080
So...

1289
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,260
So you guys...

1290
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,360
Like I said...

1291
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,300
I mentioned...

1292
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:33,880
Um...

1293
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,180
Earlier this stream that...

1294
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,140
Um...

1295
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,200
That...

1296
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,500
Um...

1297
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,020
Uh...

1298
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,120
Last year...

1299
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:43,840
During...

1300
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,000
Anniversary...

1301
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,420
We...

1302
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,600
Listened to...

1303
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,300
Or we...

1304
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,280
We watched my debut video and everything.

1305
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,080
And...

1306
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,180
Uh...

1307
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,560
This time...

1308
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,860
I have something a little...

1309
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,940
Different...

1310
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,660
For you all...

1311
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,940
Um...

1312
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,280
This was recorded...

1313
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,680
Let's see...

1314
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,860
Uh-uh-uh...

1315
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,680
Uh-uh-uh...

1316
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,060
This was recorded...

1317
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:12,900
Oh!

1318
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,480
There it is...

1319
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,500
Uh...

1320
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,740
Wednesday...

1321
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,500
April 29th...

1322
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:18,840
2020...

1323
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:24,860
Wait...

1324
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:25,920
Do...

1325
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,940
Do you know what date is tomorrow?

1326
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,320
Uh-uh-uh...

1327
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:33,790
Um...

1328
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,150
This was recorded...

1329
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,310
April 29th...

1330
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,870
2020...

1331
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:39,670
But you're like...

1332
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,190
Minto...

1333
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,650
Today is July 24th...

1334
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:43,010
Your debut...

1335
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:43,750
Uh-uh...

1336
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,110
I can't believe it!

1337
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,450
Oh...

1338
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,410
Um...

1339
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:52,910
Uh...

1340
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:53,410
But...

1341
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:54,070
Maybe...

1342
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,410
Some people know...

1343
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,810
I've talked about this before...

1344
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,970
Um...

1345
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:58,890
Uh...

1346
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,490
I...

1347
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,350
Originally...

1348
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,130
Originally...

1349
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,230
Originally...

1350
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,750
Auditioned for HoloLive...

1351
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:04,770
Like...

1352
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:05,290
Myth...

1353
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:06,310
HoloLive, right?

1354
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,590
I auditioned...

1355
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,050
Way, way back in the day...

1356
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,010
But I...

1357
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,170
Did not have any streaming experience...

1358
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:14,410
I had a little bit of...

1359
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,290
Video experience...

1360
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:16,790
But...

1361
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:17,610
Tiny, tiny bit...

1362
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:18,970
My channel had maybe...

1363
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,130
Five people watching...

1364
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,250
You know?

1365
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:21,470
Uh-uh-uh...

1366
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,130
And, um...

1367
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,870
So the first thing...

1368
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:25,990
I did obviously...

1369
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,110
Was make...

1370
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:28,970
An audition video!

1371
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,510
Uh-uh-uh...

1372
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:31,910
Which...

1373
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:33,190
Was...

1374
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,490
Barely a video...

1375
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:36,390
It was a picture...

1376
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:37,670
And...

1377
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,270
Because I had nothing!

1378
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,510
It was just a picture...

1379
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,070
And me talking!

1380
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:42,270
Uh-uh-uh...

1381
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,450
So would you guys like to listen to my audition tape?

1382
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,730
I had to cut some things out...

1383
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,450
I had to cut a few things out...

1384
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:51,850
Just for personal...

1385
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,210
You know?

1386
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,790
But would you guys like to listen to...

1387
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,950
My audition tape for...

1388
01:07:58,770 --> 01:07:59,270
HoloLive...

1389
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,570
Myth?

1390
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,550
I can show you too...

1391
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,210
This is...

1392
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:08,410
I even have the image that I used in the background...

1393
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:08,750
Um...

1394
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:09,750
There are some...

1395
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,910
You guys might...

1396
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,870
Hear a little bit of...

1397
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:13,950
Difference...

1398
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:16,250
In some details...

1399
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,590
Do ignore...

1400
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,530
Everything that you know now...

1401
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:20,050
Is...

1402
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:20,950
Correct...

1403
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:21,290
Okay?

1404
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:22,570
Okay!

1405
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,310
And obviously...

1406
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,230
I did listen to this...

1407
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,930
Because I had to make sure that there was...

1408
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,410
Not...

1409
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:29,330
Uh...

1410
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,250
Personal stuff...

1411
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:33,070
But it's still extremely cringe for me to listen to...

1412
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:33,430
So...

1413
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:35,070
You can enjoy my reaction...

1414
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,170
And maybe me giving some additional context...

1415
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:37,930
To some...

1416
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:39,830
Stuff as well...

1417
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:40,570
Oh...

1418
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:41,050
Gosh!

1419
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,330
This is...

1420
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:45,690
Okay!

1421
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:48,690
This is an actual blast from the past...

1422
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,690
Okay, here's the image that I used...

1423
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,090
For my...

1424
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:52,430
Um...

1425
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,590
Please, once again...

1426
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,890
Ignore the inconsistencies...

1427
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,310
I was wrong...

1428
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:56,570
I...

1429
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,570
I do not know how to count...

1430
01:08:59,370 --> 01:08:59,890
Okay?

1431
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:01,030
Okay...

1432
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,150
This is what it was the background...

1433
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,290
Just that...

1434
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:10,450
That I made that...

1435
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,290
Because I had no form...

1436
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,370
I was truly just a little wisp...

1437
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:15,810
I was just a wisp...

1438
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:16,710
Back then, you know?

1439
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:17,770
And...

1440
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,130
That was the background...

1441
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,150
And now we will listen to...

1442
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:26,170
Wait, hold on...

1443
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,390
I think I...

1444
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:27,890
Hold on...

1445
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:28,730
Let me double check...

1446
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:28,830
It's...

1447
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:29,670
It's kind of long...

1448
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,490
But I think I...

1449
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:33,330
Oh, yeah, yeah...

1450
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:33,830
Okay, okay...

1451
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,850
It's about...

1452
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,290
Four minutes long...

1453
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:36,650
I cut...

1454
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,290
I think it was...

1455
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:37,690
Yeah...

1456
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,450
I think I cut about a minute out of it...

1457
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,450
But, um...

1458
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,030
I told you all to ignore...

1459
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,890
I told you all to ignore...

1460
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,710
Oh, gosh...

1461
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:53,070
I'm so...

1462
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:54,170
Okay...

1463
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,550
Oh, here...

1464
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:58,710
Let me write some context on the screen, too...

1465
01:09:58,710 --> 01:09:59,410
Um...

1466
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:01,370
Um...

1467
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:03,070
Uh...

1468
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,810
Mint...

1469
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:06,630
Holo...

1470
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,010
Holo...

1471
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:08,310
Live...

1472
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:09,130
Audition...

1473
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,470
2020...

1474
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,430
Circa...

1475
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:14,470
2020...

1476
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:18,690
Scary...

1477
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,290
Oh, gosh...

1478
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:20,910
Okay...

1479
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,510
Oh, my gosh...

1480
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,730
This is so embarrassing...

1481
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:29,270
This is so embarrassing...

1482
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:30,610
Uh...

1483
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:31,150
Where is the...

1484
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:31,910
Oh, here it is...

1485
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:32,290
Um...

1486
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:32,770
Let me...

1487
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,330
Oh, sorry...

1488
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,270
Sorry, sorry...

1489
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:37,010
Uh...

1490
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:38,350
Outline...

1491
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,690
This is so embarrassing...

1492
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:41,990
Holy cow...

1493
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,530
But I was like...

1494
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,490
This is something maybe a little funny...

1495
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,630
That I can show you guys...

1496
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:48,430
Actually, I'm gonna do this...

1497
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:49,430
So, that's...

1498
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:51,210
Bolder...

1499
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,890
There we go...

1500
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:56,670
Okay...

1501
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:57,670
Okay...

1502
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:57,890
Okay...

1503
01:10:58,410 --> 01:10:58,890
Okay...

1504
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,250
Uh...

1505
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,110
Let's...

1506
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:05,070
Let's listen...

1507
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:05,790
And obviously...

1508
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,390
Oh, let me also say as well...

1509
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:07,630
Um...

1510
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,150
Don't take this as like a...

1511
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:11,030
What to do or what not to do...

1512
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,390
For an audition or anything...

1513
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,970
Because...

1514
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,470
I didn't even get a single view...

1515
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,030
They did not...

1516
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:17,150
They did not even...

1517
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:20,170
They did not even click on my application...

1518
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,350
So...

1519
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:22,830
And...

1520
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:23,150
Um...

1521
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,610
Obviously, everybody that joined...

1522
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:29,830
Is absolutely perfect for who they were...

1523
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:30,270
So...

1524
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,150
Or who they are...

1525
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:33,010
So...

1526
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:34,090
Um...

1527
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,130
Uh...

1528
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:35,990
It's...

1529
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,050
It's, you know...

1530
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,890
I'm not salty or anything about it...

1531
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:40,150
Which...

1532
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:40,890
When I say that...

1533
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:42,710
It makes me sound like I'm salty...

1534
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:43,230
But...

1535
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,890
But no...

1536
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,310
No, it's just really funny to...

1537
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,430
Go back and listen to this show...

1538
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,170
Yeah...

1539
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,770
Okie dokie...

1540
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:50,890
I...

1541
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:51,250
I...

1542
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:51,410
I...

1543
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:51,510
I...

1544
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:51,810
I...

1545
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:52,290
I...

1546
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:52,690
I...

1547
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:52,990
I...

1548
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:54,090
I can't...

1549
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:55,570
I can't...

1550
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:56,270
I can't...

1551
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,630
I can't buy a soup...

1552
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,090
I'm so...

1553
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:02,510
Ok...

1554
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,510
Here we go...

1555
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:06,110
Hi there...

1556
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:07,190
It's nice to meet you...

1557
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,130
My name is Mint...

1558
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,610
And I am a forever 20-year-old maid...

1559
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:10,790
Uh...

1560
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:12,330
Some things I really enjoy...

1561
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,010
Are anime...

1562
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,170
Japanese idols...

1563
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:14,930
Mobagei...

1564
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,870
And video games...

1565
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:15,890
Uh...

1566
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,270
Mobagei...

1567
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:16,930
Horror...

1568
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:17,170
And spooky things...

1569
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,030
I think at that time...

1570
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,010
I was really into Dragalia...

1571
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:19,090
And of course...

1572
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,570
Virtual YouTubers...

1573
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,470
A little about me is that...

1574
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,310
Virtual YouTubers...

1575
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:52,290
I started out as a new maid...

1576
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:53,870
A little about me is that...

1577
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,490
I started out as a new maid...

1578
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:56,410
In the maid cafe...

1579
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:56,950
And you know...

1580
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:59,930
I just had a teeny tiny little accident...

1581
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:00,610
And I have...

1582
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:00,950
Sorry...

1583
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:01,970
Kind of died...

1584
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,310
But I live on as a ghost...

1585
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,410
Spreading my moe magic to everyone...

1586
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:07,630
All over the world...

1587
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:07,930
Um...

1588
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,390
I never really got the chance...

1589
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,070
To fully live my maid dreams...

1590
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:11,290
And...

1591
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:11,430
True...

1592
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,130
I don't really mind being a ghost...

1593
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:14,990
Especially since I love horror things so much...

1594
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,230
That's true...

1595
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:15,930
That's not true...

1596
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,030
It's almost like a dream...

1597
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:18,790
Being able to be an eternal maid...

1598
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,990
You know?

1599
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,010
That's so true...

1600
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,370
That's so true...

1601
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,310
Pass to me...

1602
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,510
It was a genius...

1603
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,430
So true...

1604
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:25,430
So true...

1605
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:28,250
Yeah...

1606
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,190
This is a dream to be an eternal maid...

1607
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,010
No...

1608
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:33,730
Okay...

1609
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:34,990
Virtual YouTubers...

1610
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:35,170
What?

1611
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,870
Why does it keep going to virtual?

1612
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:37,790
I get that...

1613
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:39,570
Sorry...

1614
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,050
Okay...

1615
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:40,850
I'm just gonna have to...

1616
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,690
I can't pause...

1617
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,530
I'm just gonna...

1618
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,870
To let it go...

1619
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:44,950
I'm just gonna...

1620
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:47,150
I'm just gonna have to let it go...

1621
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,650
What do you mean what happened?

1622
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:54,650
Okay...

1623
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:55,510
Maybe we end it here...

1624
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:56,350
Accident...

1625
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:56,870
And I...

1626
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,890
Ah...

1627
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:57,630
No, no, no, hold on...

1628
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:57,890
Wait...

1629
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:58,090
Accident...

1630
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:58,390
And I...

1631
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,670
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

1632
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:00,930
Here...

1633
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,910
...so much...

1634
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:02,390
But...

1635
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,490
It's almost like a dream...

1636
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,350
Being able to be an eternal maid...

1637
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:05,490
Yes...

1638
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:05,810
Oh god...

1639
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:06,270
I'm gonna...

1640
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,390
I'm already dead...

1641
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:09,110
I wanna die...

1642
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,890
I wanna die...

1643
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,390
If I have my viewers and fans behind me...

1644
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,110
I think I can continue on...

1645
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:14,310
Mmm...

1646
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:15,690
But not to the afterlife...

1647
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:16,150
Not yet...

1648
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,270
I'm in the afterlife...

1649
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,270
What are you talking about?

1650
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,470
I really want to become a VTuber...

1651
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,910
So I can enjoy my ghostly life with everyone...

1652
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,150
With really, really fun videos...

1653
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:24,070
Oh...

1654
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,470
I'm really not creepy...

1655
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,270
I'm just super cute and goofy...

1656
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,750
I promise...

1657
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,730
I am creepy...

1658
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,150
So...

1659
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:32,770
There are a few VTubers I really look up to...

1660
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,310
I'm so glad they didn't listen to this...

1661
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,330
Kaguya Luna...

1662
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:35,470
Hime Hina...

1663
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,070
And Denno Shoujo Shiro...

1664
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:39,550
I often also watch Natsuhiro Matsuri...

1665
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:40,250
Oh yeah...

1666
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:40,850
I did it at the time...

1667
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:43,310
And I just love how cute and air-headed she can be...

1668
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:44,490
And Hoshimachi Suisei...

1669
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:45,050
Yeah...

1670
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,010
She has such an amazing voice...

1671
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,430
I just love listening to her music...

1672
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:49,250
Yeah...

1673
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:52,550
I used to actually perform as an idol in Akihabara...

1674
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:56,470
So I have experience with singing and performing in front of an audience...

1675
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:58,510
I think it can be similar to...

1676
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:58,930
You know...

1677
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:00,950
Having a good presence in videos as well...

1678
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:06,570
I actually got to perform on the same stage that AKB48 performed on...

1679
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:07,010
This is true...

1680
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,450
So it was really, really, really exciting...

1681
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:08,950
This is true...

1682
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,270
I'm actually still just...

1683
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,130
I'm still studying Japanese...

1684
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:16,730
But I'm able to hold a conversation since I learned a lot during my idol days...

1685
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:17,290
I think I was like...

1686
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,830
And I'm doing my best to study lots and lots and lots...

1687
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:23,530
And my dream would be to collaborate with all the Japanese HoloLive members...

1688
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,130
This is so...

1689
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,970
Yes...

1690
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:29,790
So I'd love to be able to communicate with everyone in Japan and all over the world...

1691
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:32,930
But if it's all over the world, maybe I should pick up another language, huh?

1692
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,170
Yeah, I never did that...

1693
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:34,950
And I'm on my YouTube channel...

1694
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:37,310
I did all my own filming and editing...

1695
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:42,230
So I am confident that I would be able to deliver fun content at least three times a week...

1696
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,590
And as I mentioned earlier, I really, really love horror...

1697
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,770
Yes...

1698
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:48,230
So I would love playing and reacting to horror games...

1699
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:48,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1700
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,250
And even though I love it so much...

1701
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,770
And I watch...

1702
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,650
Horror movies and things every day...

1703
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:53,930
Don't say it, Minto!

1704
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:53,990
Don't say it, Minto!

1705
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:55,530
There's still a really big baby about it...

1706
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,470
And sometimes I have to sleep with the lights on it...

1707
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:57,850
That's not true...

1708
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,310
That's not true, you guys!

1709
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:59,670
That's never happened before ever!

1710
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,290
I don't know, maybe people will find my screams entertaining, right?

1711
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:01,990
You do!

1712
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:05,210
And as for anime, I really enjoy all sorts of series...

1713
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:08,510
Some of my favorite shows are Detective Conan and Konosuba...

1714
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:12,230
And I am proud to say that I have seen every Detective Conan episode...

1715
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:13,410
At the time, that was true!

1716
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,870
I've written something, something...

1717
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,770
Oh gosh, how many are now?

1718
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,850
A thousand something, something!

1719
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:20,030
But I listen to everyone about their favorite shows...

1720
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:21,410
And what they're watching in the current season...

1721
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:22,350
Yeah!

1722
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:26,490
I also would really enjoy creating my own singing cover videos...

1723
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,930
I think it would be so much fun to cover...

1724
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:29,090
The Hololive songs...

1725
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,090
And anime songs...

1726
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,050
And idol songs...

1727
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,890
Singing is definitely one of my passions...

1728
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,690
And I'll make anything into a song...

1729
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:34,950
Oh no, oh...

1730
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:35,990
Like, you know, for example...

1731
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,610
Oh no, I hate to...

1732
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:37,670
Wait, I meant to take this out!

1733
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,310
Kind of like that...

1734
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,830
So I really hope I'm considered to be one of the next VTubers...

1735
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,550
With the Hololive production team...

1736
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:49,490
It would honestly be such a dream to be able to start this journey...

1737
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:53,070
And I really think being able to reach out to so many people with my passions...

1738
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,630
Would spark others to pursue their passions as well...

1739
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,430
I'm a super duper passionate person...

1740
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:00,550
And I just want to make others laugh and enjoy themselves...

1741
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:01,370
And you know...

1742
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:03,130
Since my life is cut short...

1743
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,450
I want everyone to have a fun life...

1744
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:05,870
Every day!

1745
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,750
So thank you so much for watching...

1746
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,890
And I look forward to hearing back from you...

1747
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:10,750
Se no...

1748
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,850
Moe Moe Kyun!

1749
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,370
Thank you so much for watching!

1750
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:13,990
Bye bye!

1751
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,760
I'm so glad they didn't watch it...

1752
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,250
I'm so glad...

1753
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,750
I'm so glad they didn't...

1754
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:27,710
I'm so glad they didn't watch it!

1755
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,530
I'm so glad...

1756
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,510
I'm...

1757
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:36,310
I'm so glad they didn't watch it!

1758
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:42,400
Oh...

1759
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,620
Yeah, I never got a single...

1760
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:44,780
Actually, I wonder...

1761
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,460
If it's still on my channel...

1762
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:49,740
Hmm...

1763
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,440
Maybe you guys can watch it...

1764
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,180
Well, no, I can't because I...

1765
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:56,740
I can't because I had to take out the personal info...

1766
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,300
So...

1767
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,900
Yes, that was...

1768
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,860
That was my...

1769
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,120
Hello Live!

1770
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,420
Audition 2020!

1771
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,460
Oh no, it's not on my channel anymore...

1772
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:17,400
Actually...

1773
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,500
Actually, I don't even think this channel existed at the time...

1774
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,140
No, wait!

1775
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:22,700
It didn't!

1776
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,820
It didn't exist because...

1777
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,780
Because...

1778
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,580
Um...

1779
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,500
My...

1780
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:30,960
My...

1781
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,300
My...

1782
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,580
I got the notification the other day that I was like...

1783
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,340
Your channel's...

1784
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:35,480
Five years old!

1785
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:37,480
So...

1786
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:37,900
No!

1787
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,640
What did you guys...

1788
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,720
Would you have hired me if you had...

1789
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,540
Would you have hired me if you...

1790
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:49,220
Um...

1791
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,160
If you...

1792
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,860
Had her in...

1793
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:52,660
My audition!

1794
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,020
No...

1795
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,100
Yes, yes, no...

1796
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes, no...

1797
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,560
But obviously...

1798
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,040
I understand...

1799
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,160
You know...

1800
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,380
I didn't have anything...

1801
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:12,040
And that's why...

1802
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:13,760
I...

1803
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,760
That's why I started streaming!

1804
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,040
Because I was just like...

1805
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:16,440
Oh...

1806
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,340
I will...

1807
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,360
I will...

1808
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,680
I will...

1809
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,360
Become...

1810
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,480
I will...

1811
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,860
Become a streamer...

1812
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:23,920
So that I can...

1813
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,680
Actually...

1814
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,160
I didn't even know if I would like streaming...

1815
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,400
What if I hated it?

1816
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,040
You just start immediately...

1817
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:32,960
What if I hated it?

1818
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:33,260
You know?

1819
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:39,800
So...

1820
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:45,360
Hmm...

1821
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,980
Sorry, I'm eating also...

1822
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,080
One of those...

1823
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:48,720
Throat...

1824
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,700
Syrups, so...

1825
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,880
Sorry if I was like...

1826
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,400
Oh wow...

1827
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,340
While...

1828
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,400
Talking...

1829
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,840
Okay...

1830
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,480
That's over with...

1831
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,180
I shared with you...

1832
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,880
Something very personal...

1833
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,440
And...

1834
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,160
Oh, despite...

1835
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,400
Everything...

1836
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:19,680
Everything...

1837
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,180
That happened...

1838
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,220
I'm very happy...

1839
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:21,980
Where I am...

1840
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,020
So...

1841
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,160
Hmm...

1842
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:24,980
Hmm...

1843
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,080
Very...

1844
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,500
Very...

1845
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,360
Grateful...

1846
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,960
Thanks for the lore drop!

1847
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:37,420
Yeah...

1848
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:42,700
I don't think I've...

1849
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,500
I don't think I've...

1850
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:43,540
I don't think I...

1851
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,900
Showed anybody that before...

1852
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,340
Truly...

1853
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,140
Truly...

1854
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,640
I think you guys are the...

1855
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,100
First...

1856
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,780
That's the first time I've ever shown anybody my...

1857
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,600
Audition...

1858
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:58,220
So...

1859
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,160
Scary...

1860
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,360
Scary...

1861
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,160
Ah...

1862
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:03,300
Oh...

1863
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:03,800
Oh...

1864
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,240
Oh...

1865
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,900
World premiere...

1866
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,520
Not even...

1867
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:07,520
No...

1868
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:07,840
No...

1869
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,260
No...

1870
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:09,140
Well...

1871
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:09,720
I...

1872
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,720
Didn't tell anybody that I...

1873
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,260
Wanted to be...

1874
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:15,720
No...

1875
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,600
None of my friends...

1876
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,600
I never told them any...

1877
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,490
About my channel...

1878
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,430
At all...

1879
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,580
At all...

1880
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:22,460
So...

1881
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:23,660
Um...

1882
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:26,260
My friends didn't know until I went to heaven actually...

1883
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,340
And...

1884
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:30,960
And...

1885
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,040
And...

1886
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,440
I have people messaging me like...

1887
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:34,680
Huh?

1888
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,560
Is this you?

1889
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,620
What?

1890
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,540
And then...

1891
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:40,420
You?

1892
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,200
And I was like...

1893
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,620
He he he...

1894
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,800
Ah ha ha...

1895
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:45,080
Ah

1896
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,520
ha...

1897
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,280
Ah ha...

1898
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:52,760
Sorry...

1899
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,680
Ah ha ha...

1900
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:54,240
This you?

1901
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:00,680
Crazy...

1902
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,080
We got vids first...

1903
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:11,010
I didn't know you were a virtual YouTuber...

1904
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,210
I love virtual YouTuber...

1905
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,650
Shall we keep singing?

1906
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,890
Shall we keep singing singing?

1907
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:26,030
Someone requested this earlier?

1908
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:29,530
Uh...

1909
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:30,150
Wait...

1910
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:30,510
Uh...

1911
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:30,710
Wait...

1912
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:31,770
Now I have to go back...

1913
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,730
Oh it's...

1914
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:33,310
Wait...

1915
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,680
Wait...

1916
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:39,700
Hold...

1917
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:41,900
Wait...

1918
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:42,840
Where is it?

1919
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,100
Eh...

1920
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:45,660
Maybe here?

1921
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:50,800
Yes.

1922
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,320
Yes.

1923
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:52,940
One moment.

1924
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,120
I got to get the lyrics.

1925
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,240
It's been a long time since I've sung this song, so I hope I remember it.

1926
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,060
How to sing it.

1927
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:11,980
It might come back to me.

1928
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:12,920
You know?

1929
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,480
Like riding a bike.

1930
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:17,640
It might come back to me.

1931
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,380
Uh... Oh, shoot.

1932
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,020
Oh, hiccups.

1933
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:22,320
Sorry.

1934
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,220
I hope I don't have hiccups now.

1935
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,320
Oh, no.

1936
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:33,840
Please, no.

1937
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,520
Please, no.

1938
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,020
Oh, gosh.

1939
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:38,920
My computer is breaking.

1940
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,240
Hold on.

1941
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,940
I want to turn it down, but it's not.

1942
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:43,440
Wait.

1943
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:43,760
What?

1944
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:44,580
Redo.

1945
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:45,680
Restart.

1946
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,120
Restart.

1947
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:46,560
Restart.

1948
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,140
Oh, sorry.

1949
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:14,440
Hold on.

1950
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,260
These lyrics are bad.

1951
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:17,800
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1952
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:18,720
One moment.

1953
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,560
Ah, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1954
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,520
Okay, one more time.

1955
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,340
You

1956
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:58,880
know what?

1957
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,690
no question

1958
01:25:33,160 --> 01:26:05,950
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do The other hand,

1959
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:09,870
the way I used to the cuirly now.

1960
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:15,510
And the second one, the way I used to play it together reacting to somebody else.

1961
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:27,370
When the mirror came, you might see the pandemic actually really rough awhile.

1962
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:34,870
You have to stay, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

1963
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:01,830
And this is the second one.

1964
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,200
I'm going to go to the next one.

1965
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:15,920
I'm going to go to the next one.

1966
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,720
The lyrics also got weird on this version too.

1967
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,020
Why?

1968
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,400
Why can't I find lyrics at work?

1969
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,160
I don't know.

1970
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,160
Odoriko.

1971
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,400
Odoriko, Odoriko.

1972
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,420
Oh, the camera.

1973
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:40,530
Staring at you.

1974
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:42,010
Okay!

1975
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:43,410
Thank you!

1976
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:46,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1977
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,680
Oh, I have this song.

1978
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:11,660
I said I would sing.

1979
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:14,120
I said I would sing.

1980
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,560
I said I would sing.

1981
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,340
I don't know.

1982
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,040
Maybe this version.

1983
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:20,560
Let's listen to it.

1984
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:20,820
Hold on.

1985
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:21,800
Let me listen to it real quick.

1986
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,120
Let's see if it sounds good.

1987
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,600
Oh, it sounds fine, I think.

1988
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,200
Okay, so, oh my gosh, it sounds like an old-timey karaoke.

1989
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,220
This is so good.

1990
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,460
It sounds old-timey.

1991
01:30:11,270 --> 01:31:01,290
Whenever sang my songs On the stage, on my own Whenever said my words Wishing they would be heard I saw you smiling at me I saw you smiling at me Was it real or just my fantasy You'd always be there in the corner Of this tiny little bar My last night here for you Same old songs,

1992
01:31:01,510 --> 01:32:17,510
just once more My last night here with you Maybe yes, maybe no I kind of liked it your way How you shyly placed your eyes on me Oh, did you ever know That I had mine on you Darling, so there you are With that look on your face As if you're never hurt As if you're never down Shall I be the one for you Who pinches you softly But sure If frown is shown then I will know that You are no dream

1993
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,740
Don't get so close, I'm shy!

1994
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,460
So let me come to you.

1995
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:57,920
Close as I wanna be.

1996
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,900
Close enough for me.

1997
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:07,880
To feel your heart beating fast.

1998
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:13,620
And stay there as I whisper.

1999
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:19,660
How I loved your peaceful eyes on me.

2000
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:29,820
And did you ever know that I had mine on you?

2001
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,380
Darling, so share with me.

2002
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:41,660
Your love if you have enough.

2003
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:47,240
Your tears if you're holding back.

2004
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:53,600
Or pain if that's what it is.

2005
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,200
How can I let you...

2006
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,880
In the dress and love.

2007
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:08,260
Just reach me out then.

2008
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:15,040
You will know that you are no dreamer.

2009
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,720
Darling, so there you are.

2010
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:25,240
With that look on your face.

2011
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:29,980
As if you're never hurt.

2012
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:35,020
As if you're never down.

2013
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:40,740
Shall I be the one for you?

2014
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:47,000
Who pinches you softly by shore.

2015
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:57,840
You will know that you are no dreamer.

2016
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:18,970
Yay!

2017
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:23,390
That was eyes on me.

2018
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:31,370
Sorry.

2019
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:34,550
I didn't expect to zoom in.

2020
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:34,750
Hold on.

2021
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:35,470
Let me turn off the camera.

2022
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:36,670
I can't look at it.

2023
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:37,430
I get too shy.

2024
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:38,930
I get too shy.

2025
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,950
Because it feels so close.

2026
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:42,210
And then I sing a song like that.

2027
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:48,510
And it feels... It feels... It feels... Too... Too... Too... Too intimate, you know?

2028
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:52,930
Okay.

2029
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:54,730
We're normal?

2030
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:55,290
We're fine.

2031
01:35:55,410 --> 01:35:55,830
We're normal.

2032
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:56,670
We're fine.

2033
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:57,230
We're normal.

2034
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,070
Are you guys excited?

2035
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:00,970
Just two more songs until the announcement.

2036
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:04,590
Just two more.

2037
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:07,450
What should we sing?

2038
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:10,930
Hmm...

2039
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:14,330
I had some songs written, but I'm feeling kind of...

2040
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:16,850
Maybe... I'll sing this one.

2041
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:20,950
If I can remember how to sing it.

2042
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:21,510
Oh gosh.

2043
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:22,570
I don't want to mess it up though.

2044
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:24,970
I have no confidence.

2045
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:28,810
I have no confidence.

2046
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:30,290
Wait.

2047
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:31,810
Actually, is there even...

2048
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:34,250
Uh...

2049
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:35,110
Maybe.

2050
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:47,250
I don't think I've ever sung this song before, so...

2051
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:49,850
Wait, let me make sure this... What?

2052
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:54,230
I could have sworn that there was a...

2053
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:56,070
Carol... Not caro-fun.

2054
01:36:56,650 --> 01:36:57,270
Oh my god.

2055
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:58,730
Oh my god.

2056
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:03,380
Okay, I'll try...

2057
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:03,780
Wait, hold on.

2058
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:04,700
Let me hear it real quick.

2059
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:10,220
I'm listening.

2060
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,500
I'm not just sitting here bopping my head to nothing.

2061
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:15,660
Ah...

2062
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:17,560
Okay,

2063
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,140
I think I remember it.

2064
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,700
It's summer, so we have to sing this song.

2065
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,900
Wait, let me start over.

2066
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:31,260
Sorry.

2067
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:57,920
Unless You were What has to do.

2068
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:03,880
I think I can remember the shadow of the night.

2069
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:04,380
I've been looking for the light that summer.

2070
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:21,700
I've been looking for the light that I've ever been.

2071
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:26,260
I'm not going to be a little.

2072
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:28,300
I'm not going to be a little.

2073
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:40,140
Sayonara, I wrote a letter in your eyes.

2074
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,120
This is the second one.

2075
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:13,880
Oh, I love you.

2076
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:17,320
I can't forget it.

2077
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:24,260
But if it's winter...

2078
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:24,540
This

2079
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:28,640
is my ass.

2080
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:29,040
Sorry.

2081
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:43,090
I'm... I'm swapping.

2082
01:39:58,350 --> 01:40:00,530
Oh, I can't read that.

2083
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:02,730
Oh, I can't read that.

2084
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:06,290
Oh, I can't read that.

2085
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:10,290
Don't forget it.

2086
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,190
I'm so sorry.

2087
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,410
I'm so sorry.

2088
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:19,350
But I'm so sorry.

2089
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:37,770
And this is the first sentence.

2090
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:37,830
And this is the second sentence.

2091
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:38,850
And this is the second sentence.

2092
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:39,370
In the fall.

2093
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:52,870
Oh, I love you.

2094
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:54,430
Sorry.

2095
01:40:54,810 --> 01:41:00,350
I can't be able to forget, but...

2096
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,630
In the next summer, we will be here again.

2097
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:43,150
Remember summer days.

2098
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:08,870
夏が消えてゆくわ通り雨があなたを連れ出していたOh, I love you.忘れられないけど

2099
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:25,330
次の夏にもまたここへくるSummer daysなななななな

2100
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:32,690
Do you guys see my heart is sparkling?

2101
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:33,110
Oh!

2102
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:34,130
Sorry.

2103
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:34,490
Wait.

2104
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:34,790
Okay.

2105
01:42:34,870 --> 01:42:35,030
Good.

2106
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:35,810
I stopped it in time.

2107
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:37,190
You can see it sparkling.

2108
01:42:37,410 --> 01:42:37,770
Can't you see?

2109
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:38,690
Hmm.

2110
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,490
That was Remember Summer Days.

2111
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:42,070
Sorry.

2112
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:43,750
I messed it up a little bit.

2113
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:46,750
Remember Summer Days.

2114
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:49,090
Well, Summer had to sing Summer Days, right?

2115
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:53,010
What's another summer song we can think of?

2116
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:58,580
Ah...

2117
01:42:58,580 --> 01:42:59,420
Summer.

2118
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:00,440
Summer.

2119
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:01,200
Summer.

2120
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:02,520
Wait.

2121
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,360
Wait.

2122
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,440
Oh, I had one.

2123
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:09,150
Oh, I think I forgot to write it down.

2124
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,050
Oh, it even had... Oh, wait.

2125
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:12,010
I remember it.

2126
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:13,510
No, I don't.

2127
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:14,690
No, I don't.

2128
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:15,510
Wait.

2129
01:43:16,050 --> 01:43:17,890
Oh, I had another summer song.

2130
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:22,830
I don't remember it.

2131
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:26,390
I know one though.

2132
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:28,630
I know one that I will sing.

2133
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,660
This one I don't think I've also ever sung before.

2134
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:39,920
Okay.

2135
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:40,540
I sing.

2136
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:43,120
Kind of relevant.

2137
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,900
Since I'm five years old now.

2138
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:48,520
Wait.

2139
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:48,840
Hello?

2140
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:49,460
Oh.

2141
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:08,090
I've seen the world.

2142
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:10,130
Done it all.

2143
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,370
Had my cake.

2144
01:44:12,970 --> 01:44:13,410
Now.

2145
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:14,130
Oh, shoot.

2146
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:16,050
Diamonds.

2147
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:17,270
Wait.

2148
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:17,690
Hold on.

2149
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:18,350
I don't...

2150
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,010
How the hell...

2151
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:19,110
Wait.

2152
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:19,950
Why am I...

2153
01:44:19,950 --> 01:44:20,390
Sorry.

2154
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:21,950
I think I'm still nervous from...

2155
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:22,190
Hold on.

2156
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,070
Let me listen to it real quick.

2157
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:23,910
Why am I...

2158
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:26,150
I literally was singing this song earlier.

2159
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:27,670
Why am I not remembering how it goes now?

2160
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:32,050
I've done it all.

2161
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:34,030
Had my cake.

2162
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:34,770
Now.

2163
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:37,930
Diamonds.

2164
01:44:38,770 --> 01:44:39,630
Okay, okay, okay.

2165
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:40,430
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2166
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:41,230
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2167
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:42,030
It's karaoke.

2168
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:42,910
It's not serious.

2169
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:45,050
It's karaoke.

2170
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:45,590
It's not serious.

2171
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:03,140
I've seen the world.

2172
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,300
Done it all.

2173
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:08,280
Had my cake now.

2174
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,640
Diamonds.

2175
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:12,620
Brilliant.

2176
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:16,640
And Bel Air now.

2177
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,900
Hot summer nights.

2178
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,100
Mid July.

2179
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:26,020
When you and I were forever wild.

2180
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,860
The crazy days.

2181
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:29,900
The city lights.

2182
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:34,180
The way you'd play with me like a child.

2183
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:41,800
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?

2184
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:50,480
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?

2185
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,580
I know you will.

2186
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:54,580
I know you will.

2187
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,700
I know you will.

2188
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,900
I know that you will.

2189
01:45:58,420 --> 01:46:03,520
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

2190
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:09,320
I've seen the world.

2191
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,380
I've seen the world.

2192
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:11,220
Lit it up.

2193
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,200
As my stage now.

2194
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,080
Channeling angels.

2195
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,320
In the new age now.

2196
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,580
Am I saying this right or wrong?

2197
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,700
Hot summer days.

2198
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:27,680
Rock and roll.

2199
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:29,320
The way you will.

2200
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,980
The way you'd play for me at your show.

2201
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:32,760
The way you'd play for me at your show.

2202
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,980
And all the ways I got to know.

2203
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:38,140
Your pretty face.

2204
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:40,120
An electric soul.

2205
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:47,820
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?

2206
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:48,440
Will you still beautiful?

2207
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:56,700
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?

2208
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,800
I know you will.

2209
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,640
I know you will.

2210
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:03,000
I know that you will.

2211
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:10,740
Will, will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

2212
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:21,520
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven, please let me bring my cat.

2213
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:26,020
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him.

2214
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,780
Father, tell me that you can.

2215
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:38,300
Oh, that grace, oh, that body, oh, that face makes me wanna party.

2216
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:44,080
He's like, my son, like diamonds.

2217
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:46,120
Sorry.

2218
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:54,240
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?

2219
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:02,860
Will you still love me when I've got nothing but my aching soul?

2220
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:05,760
I know I want my cat with me.

2221
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,400
I don't need no man.

2222
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:13,060
But I don't wanna think about me talking about my cat's body and face.

2223
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:16,520
I'm no longer beautiful.

2224
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:24,920
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

2225
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:33,640
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

2226
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:43,880
Luckily for you guys, I'm Forever 19, no matter what you heard earlier.

2227
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,720
Forever 19, baby!

2228
01:48:49,540 --> 01:48:50,240
Yippee!

2229
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,720
Oh

2230
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:58,050
man, beautiful.

2231
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,460
I think it's announcement time.

2232
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:16,870
I'm scared.

2233
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,790
Um...

2234
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:23,330
Oh, let me turn the camera off.

2235
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:28,540
Ah, it was too late.

2236
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:37,680
Are you guys ready?

2237
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,400
Ready,

2238
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:44,410
ready, ready, ready, ready.

2239
01:49:45,110 --> 01:49:46,550
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.

2240
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:54,870
Okay, I don't have anything special to play.

2241
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:56,970
So it's just gonna be me counting down, okay?

2242
01:49:58,010 --> 01:49:59,670
I don't have anything...

2243
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:09,460
Special, so...

2244
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:10,200
It's just...

2245
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,100
It'll be me still.

2246
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:16,630
Okay, so...

2247
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:18,030
Announcement time, everybody!

2248
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:18,630
Announcement!

2249
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:20,630
Everybody!

2250
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:23,310
Everybody, come in to hear the announcement!

2251
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:25,190
Everybody, get in here!

2252
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:26,010
Get in here!

2253
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:27,710
Hear ye, hear ye!

2254
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:31,110
Hear ye, hear ye!

2255
01:50:33,290 --> 01:50:34,470
I'm getting married?

2256
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:37,210
Yes, you probably know.

2257
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:40,430
Well, that announcement was already made, sorry.

2258
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:42,370
No, just kidding.

2259
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:45,470
I'm getting married.

2260
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:45,730
Hear ye!

2261
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:46,830
Hear ye!

2262
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,880
My first...

2263
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:55,260
Official...

2264
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:56,120
New outfit!

2265
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:00,100
Woooo!

2266
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:01,800
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah!

2267
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,860
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah!

2268
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:04,140
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah!

2269
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:05,880
Um...

2270
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:06,160
It...

2271
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,160
You're probably like...

2272
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:08,280
Uh, Minto, there's no date.

2273
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,940
Well, um...

2274
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,580
Uh...

2275
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:12,940
So there was some delays that happened.

2276
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,760
But I still wanted to make the announcement because otherwise I had nothing today!

2277
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:18,060
I had nothing!

2278
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:20,840
So...

2279
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:21,380
Um...

2280
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:21,880
New outfit!

2281
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,340
It will be August though!

2282
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:25,840
August, August!

2283
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,200
Meow!

2284
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:27,320
Meow!

2285
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:28,980
Let me show you the full silhouette!

2286
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:31,860
Wait...

2287
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:32,980
3, 2, 1...

2288
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:33,300
Butt...

2289
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:33,780
Oh...

2290
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:33,940
Oh!

2291
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:34,700
Oh, shoot!

2292
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,420
I forgot to resize it!

2293
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:38,680
Okay, well...

2294
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:41,660
One moment...

2295
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:42,660
Wait, one...

2296
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,360
One second, let me resize it!

2297
01:51:49,500 --> 01:52:00,260
Okay...okay...3, 2, 1, ba-boom...and you probably noticed...there's a hashtag...hashtag...mintotaku!

2298
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:05,500
So I guess if you want to try and...I mean...if you...you don't have to.

2299
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,860
If you want to try and guess, you can, but you don't have to.

2300
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,240
Mintotaku!

2301
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,120
New outfit!

2302
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,200
Next month!

2303
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:14,620
Yippee!

2304
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:32,740
So...um...I probably will put up like a...I probably will put up like a...waiting room...that is a tentative date.

2305
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:44,160
It will be a little while, so...sorry, it's not gonna be like next week or anything...so...um...just wait a little bit, but I...I...I just wanted to...

2306
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,580
Announce it early!

2307
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:49,300
so...yeah!

2308
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,000
And that's also why i wore long hair today!

2309
01:52:54,480 --> 01:53:02,660
Because, as you can see, my hair is long...and...um...mmmmmmmmm...mMMMM!

2310
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:03,920
I already tell some details.

2311
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:05,280
Hummah hummah.

2312
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:06,660
Hummah hummah hummah.

2313
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:07,580
Hmmmm.

2314
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,720
So yeah, it's my first ever actual... I mean...

2315
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:17,720
I guess you could count like how I look now as a new outfit.

2316
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:21,120
But because I went from 1.0 to 2.0 into this outfit.

2317
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:24,220
But as like a whole brand new...

2318
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,860
Original... on this own outfit.

2319
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,980
This is the first ever.

2320
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,560
So I'm very excited.

2321
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,640
I'm so excited.

2322
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2323
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:36,980
Yippee!

2324
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,080
That's the announcement!

2325
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:46,910
Exciting, exciting, exciting!

2326
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:52,150
It only took five years!

2327
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:57,330
It only took five years for me to change clothes!

2328
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:04,070
Ah, yeah, baby.

2329
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:06,910
I'll stick it up here.

2330
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:11,490
Yeah!

2331
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:12,850
Yeah, yeah.

2332
01:54:12,990 --> 01:54:14,570
I guess we can sing a few more songs.

2333
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,540
Outfit 3 in 2030?

2334
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:27,620
Hey.

2335
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:27,780
I...

2336
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:30,600
I feel like it might be that with how...

2337
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,500
Busy...

2338
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,160
Celia Papa is.

2339
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:40,120
Yes.

2340
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:43,820
Isn't it better though?

2341
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,520
To...

2342
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:45,820
Kind of space things out?

2343
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,980
Let things simmer a bit?

2344
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:48,340
No!

2345
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,260
Let them let...

2346
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,440
You get an outfit and then you...

2347
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,020
You...

2348
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:55,740
You kind of wait on it!

2349
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:56,700
You use it!

2350
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:57,700
And then...

2351
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:57,940
You...

2352
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,420
And then...

2353
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,100
I don't know.

2354
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,440
Next year, I'll get another outfit.

2355
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:03,780
So...

2356
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:05,460
Hmm...

2357
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:06,700
Hmm...

2358
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:15,360
Exciting!

2359
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:17,160
Exciting, exciting, exciting, exciting, exciting.

2360
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:17,980
Um...

2361
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:18,860
What should we sing next?

2362
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:20,680
Hold on.

2363
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:21,980
Let me do my throat spray real quick.

2364
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:24,420
Come...

2365
01:55:24,420 --> 01:55:26,200
My throat...

2366
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:27,940
Has been...

2367
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:28,980
It doesn't...

2368
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:30,800
Sound...

2369
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,360
End up sounding bad, but it does start to hurt after a while, so...

2370
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:41,660
Um...

2371
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,500
Suki akari?

2372
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:44,740
Oh, I think I know that one actually.

2373
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:45,280
Wait, hold on.

2374
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:50,940
I think I do know that one.

2375
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:52,900
Oh!

2376
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,400
Yeah, darker than black!

2377
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,140
Oh my gosh!

2378
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:57,220
I used to listen to this song all the time.

2379
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:00,180
Do I remember it still?

2380
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:00,680
Hold on.

2381
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:01,620
Let me listen to it real quick.

2382
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:04,760
I might remember it.

2383
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:08,920
Gosh...

2384
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:09,740
Boomer?

2385
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:12,160
Requesting darker than black?

2386
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,040
Boomer?

2387
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:14,800
Boomer?

2388
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:41,220
Yeah, eh...

2389
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:41,660
Oh...

2390
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:41,700
Sorry.

2391
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,320
I'm... I'm making sure I know it.

2392
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:55,600
Oh my gosh...

2393
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,960
Oh, I used to listen to this song so often.

2394
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,920
Okay, let me try singing it.

2395
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:01,880
Sorry if it's scoff.

2396
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:13,820
I'm sorry, I'm remembering it at the same time.

2397
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:25,340
Sorry, I'm remembering it at the same time.

2398
01:58:30,780 --> 01:59:00,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2399
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:00,530
I was calling the name.

2400
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:04,190
I was calling the name.

2401
01:59:04,190 --> 01:59:06,470
I was calling the name.

2402
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:11,730
I believed in this light.

2403
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:30,950
In the middle of the night, I don't think there's any time.

2404
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:37,350
There isn't a day, I don't think about it.

2405
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:42,750
That

2406
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:48,320
part very well, sorry.

2407
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:49,920
In

2408
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:08,800
the middle of the night,

2409
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:14,640
I call my name.

2410
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:23,140
I'm going to go to Hawaii, this time.

2411
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:40,120
I'm going to go to Hawaii.

2412
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:43,400
I've been looking for my future.

2413
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:47,800
I've been looking for my future.

2414
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:52,240
I've been looking for my future.

2415
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:58,900
Little... Little fish?

2416
02:00:59,340 --> 02:00:59,960
What?

2417
02:01:00,640 --> 02:01:01,660
I

2418
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:12,390
just realized, sorry guys.

2419
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:15,270
Oh my gosh.

2420
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:33,650
Good song, wow.

2421
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:35,050
What a great recommendation!

2422
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:36,590
Oh my gosh.

2423
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:40,170
Like I said, I haven't heard that song in so long.

2424
02:01:40,570 --> 02:01:42,070
Probably like over 10 years.

2425
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:43,990
I can't believe I still remember it.

2426
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:45,210
It's kind of like those things, you know?

2427
02:01:45,850 --> 02:01:48,110
Old people can't remember much.

2428
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:50,070
But they can still remember music.

2429
02:01:50,230 --> 02:01:52,030
They hear something and it brings back everything.

2430
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:53,250
You know?

2431
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:55,350
Happy 5 years!

2432
02:01:55,530 --> 02:01:56,070
Thank you!

2433
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,400
Can you sing Do You Remember Love?

2434
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:06,480
I can.

2435
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:08,880
Actually...

2436
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,820
There's another song I want to sing too.

2437
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,860
Sorry, I'm gonna cue it up.

2438
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,680
But I will sing Do You Remember Love?

2439
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:20,060
Love...

2440
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:21,500
Uhm...

2441
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:21,940
Ah!

2442
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:22,920
It's been so long!

2443
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:23,680
I feel like there's...

2444
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:25,780
I can't stop thinking of songs that I want to sing.

2445
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,140
Well, let me just actually write it down.

2446
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:29,420
Uhm...

2447
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,240
Um, um, um, um, um, um...

2448
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:32,980
What was I gonna say?

2449
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:34,700
Oh...

2450
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,260
There we go, I remember it.

2451
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:38,240
Okay.

2452
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:39,640
Do You Remember Love?

2453
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:41,780
Let me listen to this karaoke.

2454
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:42,540
Okay, see if it's good.

2455
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:47,620
Sorry, it was so loud in my ear.

2456
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:52,120
Holy cow, this is an official one.

2457
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:54,320
I don't want to sing that because I will probably get in trouble.

2458
02:03:05,310 --> 02:03:06,630
I don't...that's not the song.

2459
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:07,590
That's not the song.

2460
02:03:08,690 --> 02:03:12,650
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, there's Caitlin Myers' version.

2461
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:13,910
Her English version.

2462
02:03:15,330 --> 02:03:16,450
I love Caitlin.

2463
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:17,610
She's so sweet.

2464
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:20,270
I miss Caitlin.

2465
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:22,210
I miss Caitlin of Final Fantasy.

2466
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:25,570
You know what?

2467
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:27,790
If it gets taken down, it gets taken down.

2468
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:53,920
Smack Cross Frontier's final live this weekend.

2469
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:56,100
I know, because Phoebe's going.

2470
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:56,320
Thank you.

2471
02:03:56,900 --> 02:04:02,080
I'm currently here for the first time.

2472
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:03,940
Let's go!

2473
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:06,480
There's a few words.

2474
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:10,000
I'm still here.

2475
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:22,120
I'm still here for the first time.

2476
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:25,880
I'm still here.

2477
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:34,140
And we are back.

2478
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:34,380
And we are back.

2479
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:48,120
The in-person, this is the first sentence.

2480
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,120
And we are back.

2481
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,580
And we are back.

2482
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:21,000
I love you so...

2483
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:24,700
A

2484
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:58,830
little pause... and we are back.

2485
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:07,150
And this is the second one.

2486
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:07,190
And this is the second one.

2487
02:07:07,190 --> 02:07:12,830
The world is now...

2488
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:21,070
Do you remember the moment that I saw the moment that I saw the moment?

2489
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:43,110
I love you so.

2490
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:07,130
Does it matter if we place our hands together?

2491
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:10,290
Does it matter when we touch our eyes?

2492
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:13,590
Do you remember me?

2493
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:19,330
When my hand and hand came together...

2494
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:26,870
It was the first time I loved it...

2495
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:35,510
I love you so...

2496
02:08:44,370 --> 02:08:45,410
I'm not a place.

2497
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:57,200
You're right, so...

2498
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,020
I'm not a place.

2499
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:13,120
You're right, so...

2500
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:24,260
I'm not a place.

2501
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:57,680
Yay!

2502
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:03,180
That was I Oboete Imashuka, aka do you remember love.

2503
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,160
I hope that was the one you were talking about.

2504
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:16,160
Now that I think about it... I don't know any other do you remember love... Ah, wait, let me put it in.

2505
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:24,460
Set list... I Oboete Imashuka...

2506
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:39,440
Actually, you know how in my audition talk... It's not really an audition video... In my audition talk sound... How I... I said I was an idol a little bit, right?

2507
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:43,160
And... Just for a little bit.

2508
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:45,140
It wasn't very long, to be honest.

2509
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:50,760
And... I think I said years in the video and then I was listening back to it.

2510
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:52,920
I was like, did I mean to put that?

2511
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,720
Because it's not accurate.

2512
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:59,600
But anyway... Um... Well, this song was one of the songs I used to sing.

2513
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:18,520
I used to sing... In... During my stages and then... During the parts where it was just like... There's the Oboete Imashuka... Me to Mega... Ureate At Toki... They're saying like... When her eyes met... With me and so I would like... Go up to somebody in the audience... And I would be like... Close,

2514
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:19,880
close, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...

2515
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:23,900
When I close up to them, with like making eye contact.

2516
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:26,220
And then the other part is...

2517
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:28,400
Um...

2518
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:31,180
Wait, maybe I got the lyrics wrong.

2519
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:34,180
Wait, but the te-to-te part with the hands.

2520
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:39,340
I would go up to somebody and I would like, like, take their hand.

2521
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:44,280
My fan saw was off the charts.

2522
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:47,780
Too bad.

2523
02:11:48,660 --> 02:11:49,540
Too bad.

2524
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:53,700
Too bad you guys can't, you know.

2525
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:55,580
I can't jump through your screen.

2526
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:59,240
You guys can't grab a ghost and go right through, you know.

2527
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:03,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2528
02:12:03,940 --> 02:12:04,640
It was so fun.

2529
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:05,380
It was so fun.

2530
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:10,040
That was good.

2531
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:12,280
I think I know what I want to say next, if that's okay.

2532
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:15,060
But I actually...

2533
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,760
I have to...

2534
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,240
Go to the bathroom.

2535
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,460
I have to go to the little ghosty's room.

2536
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:21,240
Is that okay?

2537
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,820
Baby in VR?

2538
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:24,880
Wait, that would be so fun if I...

2539
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:27,140
Wait, if I did a concert in VR...

2540
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,960
And like, had people in the audience?

2541
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:31,080
But...

2542
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:32,080
How...

2543
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:35,580
How would I get you guys to shut up?

2544
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:39,520
Imagine someone's just yapping the entire time.

2545
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:44,900
How would I make it so that you guys can't talk?

2546
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:47,720
Hmm...

2547
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:50,100
Okay, I'll be right back.

2548
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:51,520
Hold on, let me give you some music.

2549
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:47,780
Wait, sorry, I want to get more tea too.

2550
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,660
I'll be right back.

2551
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:49,240
Again.

2552
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:49,760
Sorry.

2553
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:50,500
I want more tea.

2554
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,860
I want more tea.

2555
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:52,520
Wait a second.

2556
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:50,300
What is my face?

2557
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:51,240
I look so perverted.

2558
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:52,760
What the hell?

2559
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:09,760
That was weird.

2560
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:11,700
That was weird.

2561
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:14,980
Actually, I'm just going to do this with these atlas.

2562
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:15,440
Sorry.

2563
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,680
I will put the full one in case...

2564
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:18,960
Well, you might have seen it.

2565
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:19,320
All right.

2566
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:22,620
Actually, it looks like now it's like...

2567
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:23,080
Announcement!

2568
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,280
Okay, I'll just do this.

2569
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:27,560
Yeah!

2570
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:29,280
Aren't you though?

2571
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:34,160
Yeah, but...

2572
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:35,960
But it's...

2573
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:39,820
But...

2574
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:45,340
But it's embarrassing when you say it out loud, no?

2575
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:53,020
That's why we use the word freaky here.

2576
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:53,880
Instead.

2577
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:57,320
We don't even...

2578
02:16:57,320 --> 02:16:57,660
How

2579
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:02,550
embarrassed.

2580
02:17:17,490 --> 02:17:19,110
A little freaky ghost.

2581
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:19,970
That's me!

2582
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:22,410
Decision to make that a new emote.

2583
02:17:22,550 --> 02:17:23,250
What's that face?

2584
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:32,300
And I want to thank again also everybody too.

2585
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:35,200
Who is donating via Streamlabs.

2586
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:37,200
I do see your donors and I'm seeing them.

2587
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:38,440
Especially you.

2588
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:41,360
Irish...

2589
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:42,340
Irish...

2590
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:44,300
Irish...

2591
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:45,240
Irish...

2592
02:17:46,820 --> 02:17:47,260
Wrist...

2593
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,220
Watch...

2594
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:51,720
Bye, Roebuck.

2595
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:52,140
Oh my gosh.

2596
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:52,960
Thank you so much.

2597
02:17:53,220 --> 02:17:53,880
What the hell?

2598
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:55,260
Oh, thank you.

2599
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:55,560
Thank you.

2600
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:55,920
Thank you.

2601
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:57,860
Okay.

2602
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:00,420
Okay.

2603
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,260
I have another song I want to sing.

2604
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:04,620
It's another little bit of a...

2605
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:06,420
Slow song.

2606
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:10,220
But I love Blue Archive.

2607
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:11,240
Let me get the...

2608
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:12,700
Lyrics for me.

2609
02:18:14,580 --> 02:18:16,540
Then I want to go back to singing English songs.

2610
02:18:24,980 --> 02:18:26,540
Blue Archive.

2611
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:28,020
Blue Archive.

2612
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:29,080
Blue Archive.

2613
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:32,400
You guys are already guessing it.

2614
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:35,840
You guys are already guessing it.

2615
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:36,500
He he.

2616
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,640
Oh, loud.

2617
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:41,120
Sorry.

2618
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:41,820
No.

2619
02:18:58,790 --> 02:18:58,850
Hey.

2620
02:19:02,090 --> 02:19:03,310
Jason.

2621
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:06,350
Thank you.

2622
02:19:08,270 --> 02:19:09,010
Hey.

2623
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:40,460
This is the second one.

2624
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:42,320
To be continued...

2625
02:19:42,320 --> 02:20:12,300
I think that this song is composed by the same person that composed my opening intro music.

2626
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:13,840
It's Kiyo-san!

2627
02:20:56,220 --> 02:21:02,940
And we are back, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

2628
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:07,780
Even if we are not here,

2629
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:14,480
we are back.

2630
02:21:14,940 --> 02:21:18,360
We believe that the future will be the future.

2631
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:23,080
I will...信じて...

2632
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:42,780
Sorry for all the scuff tonight.

2633
02:21:45,660 --> 02:21:46,580
It's fine.

2634
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:47,400
It's fine!

2635
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:49,040
That was 13.

2636
02:21:50,180 --> 02:21:51,320
Yumeji no Hana.

2637
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:55,240
Yumeji no Hana from Blue Aka.

2638
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:56,020
Yay!

2639
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:06,340
What should we sing next?

2640
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:07,840
Oh wait!

2641
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:09,320
There was one other song that I wanted to sing.

2642
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:10,360
One other Japanese song.

2643
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:14,060
Sorry, I forgot.

2644
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:17,400
And now so I will...

2645
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:18,100
Sing it.

2646
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:24,180
Pop off my head...

2647
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:24,420
動物のすればないの

2648
02:22:39,230 --> 02:22:45,890
netもうすぐ時計は8...6時。

2649
02:22:55,310 --> 02:23:12,130
もうそこに一番帽子かげを踏んで夜に紛れたくなる帰り道 どんなに探してみても一つしかない星 When you are from us, you appear so great...

2650
02:23:16,690 --> 02:23:22,970
I can't believe that you all are loved...

2651
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:29,450
I'm always the one out...

2652
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:33,410
well,

2653
02:23:58,690 --> 02:23:59,430
we've got the truth and we're getting started.

2654
02:24:04,390 --> 02:24:07,330
This goes down to a pair of two special ghosts.

2655
02:24:07,430 --> 02:24:10,430
I don't know if you're watching, but if you are...

2656
02:24:29,970 --> 02:24:32,690
I'm so sorry.

2657
02:24:34,450 --> 02:24:36,210
What's the first one?

2658
02:24:38,190 --> 02:24:39,530
I'll never forget.

2659
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:43,390
I'm so sorry.

2660
02:24:43,390 --> 02:24:47,310
If you're in a ring, I'll be like a star.

2661
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:48,890
I'm so sorry.

2662
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:49,770
It's a single one.

2663
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:57,890
The blood of the sun is the first time of the spring.

2664
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:31,160
This is the second one.

2665
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,280
We'll see.

2666
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:33,800
We'll see.

2667
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:37,560
I will be the first sentence.

2668
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:42,830
And this is the last sentence.

2669
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:47,690
And this is the second sentence.

2670
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:59,170
I will not be the first sentence.

2671
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:43,220
Sorry.

2672
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:44,540
Maybe I shouldn't have sung it.

2673
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:47,860
That was...

2674
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,860
A song that recently has been very, very close to my heart.

2675
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:56,280
Yeah.

2676
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:57,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2677
02:26:58,720 --> 02:26:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2678
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:03,340
Throat is still feeling good, so I can keep going, I think.

2679
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:07,060
We're just a couple more songs, and...

2680
02:27:09,420 --> 02:27:10,320
What should we sing?

2681
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:11,200
English song now.

2682
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:16,240
English song, English song, English song.

2683
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:17,800
Um...

2684
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:19,940
Actually...

2685
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:21,140
I wanna...

2686
02:27:21,140 --> 02:27:26,700
I watched the Beauty and the Beast live action not too long ago.

2687
02:27:26,820 --> 02:27:28,480
And I watched it because...

2688
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:30,200
There... Oh, I forgot to turn off the camera, sorry.

2689
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:32,260
There's a... There is... There's a song.

2690
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:34,220
What song is it that is so worth it?

2691
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:36,440
And...

2692
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:36,620
And...

2693
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:39,320
I tried singing it during that karaoke...

2694
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:40,600
Or not during... Sorry, not the karaoke.

2695
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:41,520
During that stream.

2696
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:44,100
It was a... It was a... It was a...

2697
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:45,520
What do you call...

2698
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:46,440
A...

2699
02:27:47,240 --> 02:27:47,780
A...

2700
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:49,900
Member stream.

2701
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:51,300
So...

2702
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,000
Um...

2703
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,680
It was...

2704
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:55,640
Not...

2705
02:27:55,640 --> 02:27:56,200
You know...

2706
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:57,160
A public stream.

2707
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:59,400
But I tried singing it and I...

2708
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:00,320
It's so embarrassing.

2709
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:02,300
I couldn't hit the notes because...

2710
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:03,900
Because...

2711
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:04,140
Because...

2712
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:07,080
Because my voice was so bad and now I want a...

2713
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:08,940
I want a revenge.

2714
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:11,240
I want a revenge!

2715
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:13,280
So I will try...

2716
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,480
What if I can't hit it again though?

2717
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:16,400
That would be so embarrassing.

2718
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:21,500
That would be so embarrassing!

2719
02:28:22,420 --> 02:28:23,100
But I'll try it.

2720
02:28:48,610 --> 02:28:49,610
I'm nervous.

2721
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:51,730
Because I...

2722
02:28:51,730 --> 02:28:52,510
Got it last time.

2723
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:57,930
I was the one who had it all.

2724
02:28:59,950 --> 02:29:02,550
I was the master of my fate.

2725
02:29:04,390 --> 02:29:08,930
I never needed anybody in my life.

2726
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:12,410
I learned the truth too late.

2727
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:16,950
I'll never shake away the pain.

2728
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:22,270
I close my eyes but she's still there.

2729
02:29:23,730 --> 02:29:28,050
I let her steal into my melancholy heart.

2730
02:29:28,050 --> 02:29:31,250
It's more than I can bear.

2731
02:29:31,250 --> 02:29:31,790
It's more than I can bear.

2732
02:29:34,570 --> 02:29:39,270
Now I know she'll never leave me.

2733
02:29:40,070 --> 02:29:43,220
Even as she runs away.

2734
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,130
She will still torment me.

2735
02:29:47,530 --> 02:29:48,270
Call me.

2736
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:49,390
Hurt me.

2737
02:29:49,710 --> 02:29:50,830
Move me.

2738
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:53,010
Come what may.

2739
02:29:54,130 --> 02:29:57,270
Wasting in my lonely tower.

2740
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:02,050
Waiting by an open door.

2741
02:30:03,830 --> 02:30:05,650
I'll fool myself.

2742
02:30:05,850 --> 02:30:07,190
She'll walk right in.

2743
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:11,990
And be with me forevermore.

2744
02:30:15,870 --> 02:30:18,870
I rage against the trials of love.

2745
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:23,450
I curse the fading of the light.

2746
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:29,250
Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach.

2747
02:30:29,490 --> 02:30:33,150
She's never out of sight.

2748
02:30:35,390 --> 02:30:40,190
Now I know she'll never leave me.

2749
02:30:41,070 --> 02:30:44,330
Even as she fades to view.

2750
02:30:45,570 --> 02:30:47,810
She will still inspire me.

2751
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:53,270
Be a part of everything I do.

2752
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:57,810
We sing in my lonely tower.

2753
02:30:59,070 --> 02:31:02,530
Waiting by an open door.

2754
02:31:04,290 --> 02:31:07,330
I'll flow myself, she'll walk right in.

2755
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:11,410
And as the long, long nights begin.

2756
02:31:13,170 --> 02:31:16,110
I'll think of all that might have been.

2757
02:31:16,990 --> 02:31:20,570
Waiting here forever.

2758
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:24,750
Ever...more...

2759
02:31:55,990 --> 02:31:57,330
Maybe I should end it on that.

2760
02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:00,670
No, let's end it on something less... Oh my gosh.

2761
02:32:00,950 --> 02:32:02,970
Bring back yearning.

2762
02:32:04,850 --> 02:32:05,330
Sorry.

2763
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:06,810
I love when men yearn.

2764
02:32:09,190 --> 02:32:10,130
It's so good.

2765
02:32:10,510 --> 02:32:10,810
Anyway.

2766
02:32:11,090 --> 02:32:11,310
Anyway.

2767
02:32:11,630 --> 02:32:11,870
Oh!

2768
02:32:12,150 --> 02:32:12,710
So happy!

2769
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:17,650
What's a fun song we can end it on?

2770
02:32:21,430 --> 02:32:23,010
It's time for Mickey Mouse music.

2771
02:32:27,770 --> 02:32:28,170
Sorry.

2772
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:29,930
No, I'm not going to do break stuff.

2773
02:32:30,050 --> 02:32:30,610
Oh my gosh.

2774
02:32:30,790 --> 02:32:31,410
Not with my throat.

2775
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:32,290
It's just getting better.

2776
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:34,470
Snake eater?

2777
02:32:36,910 --> 02:32:38,610
The Hilah Evergarden song.

2778
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:43,970
Oh gosh, what was that one?

2779
02:32:51,050 --> 02:32:52,050
From the star?

2780
02:32:52,310 --> 02:32:52,970
Oh, I can sing that one.

2781
02:32:53,190 --> 02:32:54,030
But I...

2782
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:55,690
Wait, I think I do actually.

2783
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:01,180
Wait.

2784
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:02,320
Wait.

2785
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:07,920
Wait.

2786
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:10,780
What was the one from Violet Evergarden?

2787
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:12,480
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna...

2788
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:13,720
I'm gonna...

2789
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:15,960
What was the one from Violet Evergarden?

2790
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:18,760
I will do a snake eater.

2791
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:19,280
Don't worry.

2792
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:20,280
Here, I'll write it down.

2793
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:22,280
Wait, but I was only gonna do one song.

2794
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:30,180
I do a snake eater every time.

2795
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:36,900
I'm trying to remember what that song was from.

2796
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:38,040
Hold on.

2797
02:33:38,140 --> 02:33:39,000
I'm gonna look it up because it...

2798
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:39,400
Oh wait.

2799
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:40,180
Letter, right?

2800
02:33:40,760 --> 02:33:41,540
That song.

2801
02:33:42,660 --> 02:33:44,480
That's such a sad song though.

2802
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:47,080
I don't want to end it on that.

2803
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:51,340
Okay, I'll do two songs.

2804
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:53,740
We'll do Letter next time.

2805
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:56,880
This time, we do this.

2806
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:11,540
What a thrill.

2807
02:34:14,300 --> 02:34:18,260
With darkness and silence through the night.

2808
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:28,980
I'm searching and I'll melt into you.

2809
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:34,540
What a fear in my heart.

2810
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:38,560
But you're so supreme.

2811
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:49,020
I give my life, not for honor, but for you.

2812
02:34:49,640 --> 02:35:02,220
In my time, there'll be no one else.

2813
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:11,100
Crime is the way I fly to you.

2814
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:18,420
I'm still in a dream.

2815
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:20,800
Snake eater.

2816
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:28,900
Some day, you go through the rain.

2817
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:34,520
And some day, you feed on a tree frog.

2818
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:39,620
This ordeal, the trial to survive.

2819
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:44,500
I give my life, not for the day, you wrap your life.

2820
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:44,680
And some day, you'll see the light.

2821
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,680
I give my life, not for

2822
02:35:58,200 --> 02:36:02,820
the rest of you.

2823
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:16,760
I give my life, not for the day.

2824
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:23,580
I'm still in a dream.

2825
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:26,280
Snake Eater.

2826
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:39,480
I'm still in a dream.

2827
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,240
Snake Eater.

2828
02:36:47,010 --> 02:36:49,090
Snake Eater.

2829
02:36:49,750 --> 02:36:50,550
Snake Eater.

2830
02:36:51,230 --> 02:36:52,870
Okay, the people requested it.

2831
02:36:53,010 --> 02:36:56,090
Ah, how, who am I to not give the people what they want?見つめ合って恋をして

2832
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:42,440
無我夢中で追いかけてだけどもっと知りたくて メラメラしてる

2833
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:54,120
願うほど夏は増え 思うほど夏になるだからもっと飛び込むの 未開の世界

2834
02:37:58,460 --> 02:38:05,740
Ah...恋とか夢とか 誰でも信じるけどそっとそっと責めなきゃ

2835
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:19,380
つまんないよギリギリ愛 いけないボーダーラインガイド字でも すべて壊したりする

2836
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:28,380
ギリギリマインド 荒なる字へと意識は溶ける

2837
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:58,160
体は制御不能見えちゃおうかもねふざけ合った友達と 乙女肌の人とまた会える日のために キラキラしてる

2838
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,140
A little pause...

2839
02:39:28,140 --> 02:39:28,140
and we are back.

2840
02:39:32,600 --> 02:39:39,160
Bawlerless...異常識だね!まだ加速しているよ !ギリギリMIND

2841

2843
02:40:52,100 --> 02:41:04,430
For your sake, for your future, Even if you're not alone, I want to love you.

2844
02:41:07,470 --> 02:41:07,950
I

2845
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:16,800
want to be loved,

2846
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:22,640
I'll be back.

2847
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:46,880
Ikenai, borderline.

2848
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:49,760
Yay!

2849
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:51,020
Yay, yay, yay.

2850
02:41:58,340 --> 02:42:01,840
Well, it's just about the last song.

2851
02:42:06,040 --> 02:42:12,440
And, you know, it's been a very tumultuous week.

2852
02:42:13,080 --> 02:42:16,120
Very tumultuous couple of weeks for me since I've known.

2853
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:26,300
You know, I found out about everything at Toho Lost Word.

2854
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:31,880
Like, right before the Lost Word Live.

2855
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:39,260
And, you know...

2856
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:47,300
And the staff was only found out a couple days before that.

2857
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:54,640
So, you know, they told us pretty much as soon as they could tell us how bad it was.

2858
02:42:56,360 --> 02:43:00,140
So, it was, um...

2859
02:43:00,140 --> 02:43:00,880
Pretty stressful.

2860
02:43:03,580 --> 02:43:04,280
I...

2861
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:05,840
Um...

2862
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:07,400
You know...

2863
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:11,100
I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do from here on out.

2864
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:17,480
But I can tell you that I will keep going at the very least.

2865
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:20,800
And I, you know...

2866
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,290
I tweeted that I really...

2867
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:25,100
I really...

2868
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:25,580
That...

2869
02:43:25,580 --> 02:43:26,680
And I mean to...

2870
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:29,380
I really meant to that I...

2871
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:30,480
Um...

2872
02:43:30,480 --> 02:43:33,500
Wouldn't be able to keep going forward without you guys.

2873
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:34,800
So...

2874
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:36,680
Thank you so, so much.

2875
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:37,420
Thank you so, so much.

2876
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:38,520
And...

2877
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:40,520
I really love...

2878
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:42,020
Each and every one of you.

2879
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:43,700
I really love the community...

2880
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:44,960
That we have here.

2881
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:48,680
And I hope that, you know...

2882
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:49,160
I...

2883
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:49,880
And I feel...

2884
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:54,060
I feel like any time I see someone new come in, they always say that...

2885
02:43:54,060 --> 02:43:55,600
You guys are very welcoming.

2886
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:56,520
And...

2887
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:58,340
You guys, um...

2888
02:43:58,340 --> 02:43:59,840
Are always so kind, and...

2889
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:02,620
Um...

2890
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:04,880
Yeah...

2891
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:05,060
I'm...

2892
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:06,120
I'm really, really grateful.

2893
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:08,100
I'm really, really happy that...

2894
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:09,040
We...

2895
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:11,320
We're able to...

2896
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:13,280
Build something so awesome...

2897
02:44:13,280 --> 02:44:14,420
In these five years.

2898
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:17,160
And...

2899
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:17,980
I know...

2900
02:44:17,980 --> 02:44:20,060
There's still names that I see...

2901
02:44:20,060 --> 02:44:21,120
From...

2902
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:21,820
2020.

2903
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:23,440
Which is so crazy!

2904
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:25,860
So absolutely insane!

2905
02:44:27,260 --> 02:44:29,940
And then I see new names almost every day as well.

2906
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,460
And that's just really exciting.

2907
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:33,320
Um...

2908
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:34,720
And I'm just really, really grateful.

2909
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:36,500
You know, I...

2910
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:36,620
I can't...

2911
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:37,040
I...

2912
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:38,600
I...

2913
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:41,860
I can't ever stop saying how grateful I am, truly.

2914
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:45,100
Um...

2915
02:44:48,540 --> 02:44:49,140
Yeah...

2916
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:52,420
So...

2917
02:44:55,720 --> 02:44:56,560
Thank you, guys.

2918
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:57,860
Back to when...

2919
02:44:57,860 --> 02:44:59,420
Back when I used to play...

2920
02:44:59,420 --> 02:45:01,000
Tetrio with everybody!

2921
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:04,920
And now...

2922
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:05,160
Gosh!

2923
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:07,760
Whatever...

2924
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:09,760
We used to watch animal cams.

2925
02:45:10,040 --> 02:45:10,680
I...

2926
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:12,760
I still think very fondly on those days.

2927
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:13,800
And I...

2928
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:17,420
You know, I...

2929
02:45:17,420 --> 02:45:18,000
I...

2930
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:19,020
Uh...

2931
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:23,520
I'll never forget my channel almost getting deleted over the frickin' BBC.

2932
02:45:24,920 --> 02:45:26,980
I once watched a...

2933
02:45:26,980 --> 02:45:28,440
I once watched a...

2934
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:32,800
I once watched a monkey spy cam video once and my channel almost got taken down.

2935
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:34,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2936
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:38,340
Totank!

2937
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:39,000
VVC!

2938
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:40,480
I'll never forgive them!

2939
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:42,280
Ha ha ha ha!

2940
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:43,600
Um...

2941
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:43,800
I...

2942
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:47,560
I guess I thought it was too much like Twitch or something that you could just watch whatever you want.

2943
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:48,360
Ha ha ha ha!

2944
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:48,880
I...

2945
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:49,460
Actually...

2946
02:45:49,460 --> 02:45:52,740
I think that strike might finally be gone from my channel.

2947
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:55,920
When I came back last year, it was still there.

2948
02:45:56,060 --> 02:45:56,440
It was.

2949
02:45:57,080 --> 02:45:57,300
It...

2950
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:58,580
Actually, I don't see it anymore.

2951
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:00,280
I think it finally disappeared.

2952
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,780
I think I'm finally in the clear!

2953
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:04,060
Ha ha ha!

2954
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:09,560
Oh wait, not last year.

2955
02:46:09,780 --> 02:46:10,740
The year before, you know.

2956
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:11,520
You know what I mean.

2957
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:14,460
But yeah...

2958
02:46:15,780 --> 02:46:16,220
Um...

2959
02:46:17,480 --> 02:46:17,920
Hmm...

2960
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:19,320
I mean...

2961
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:21,880
I wouldn't say I'm very...

2962
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:22,740
Resilient.

2963
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,520
I'm actually, you know, you guys know I'm kind of a crybaby.

2964
02:46:26,660 --> 02:46:27,540
And I...

2965
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:28,340
I...

2966
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:30,280
I take...

2967
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:32,240
Many things to heart.

2968
02:46:32,980 --> 02:46:34,820
Which is what you're not supposed to do.

2969
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:36,280
When you...

2970
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:37,220
Are...

2971
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:37,840
An...

2972
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:38,560
An...

2973
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:39,000
Internet figure.

2974
02:46:40,220 --> 02:46:40,820
Ha ha ha!

2975
02:46:40,980 --> 02:46:41,120
Ha ha ha!

2976
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:41,740
But...

2977
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:42,200
Um...

2978
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:44,080
You know...

2979
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:44,940
What am I gonna do?

2980
02:46:45,220 --> 02:46:45,780
Die?

2981
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:47,360
Bleh!

2982
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:48,340
Ha ha ha!

2983
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:51,290
Ha ha ha!

2984
02:46:51,290 --> 02:46:51,830
So...

2985
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:53,710
I'll just keep doing my best.

2986
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:55,470
And...

2987
02:46:55,470 --> 02:46:56,410
I want...

2988
02:46:56,410 --> 02:46:57,170
You know...

2989
02:46:57,170 --> 02:46:57,650
I...

2990
02:46:57,650 --> 02:46:58,610
I do want to...

2991
02:46:58,610 --> 02:46:59,250
Well, not...

2992
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:00,250
I...

2993
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:00,710
I...

2994
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:01,690
A lot of people...

2995
02:47:01,690 --> 02:47:03,230
A lot of people were commenting things.

2996
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:04,830
Like, you've done so much, Minto.

2997
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:05,970
You don't need a company.

2998
02:47:05,970 --> 02:47:07,150
You have your fans.

2999
02:47:07,510 --> 02:47:08,930
You have everything like that.

3000
02:47:09,150 --> 02:47:09,350
And...

3001
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:09,670
I...

3002
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:10,170
While...

3003
02:47:10,170 --> 02:47:11,550
They're correct, obviously.

3004
02:47:13,790 --> 02:47:14,310
While...

3005
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:14,510
They're...

3006
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:16,070
Everybody is correct saying that.

3007
02:47:16,750 --> 02:47:17,970
There's something so...

3008
02:47:17,970 --> 02:47:18,470
You know...

3009
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:18,890
You know...

3010
02:47:18,890 --> 02:47:21,030
Don't think about how valuable it is to have...

3011
02:47:21,890 --> 02:47:22,410
Um...

3012
02:47:22,410 --> 02:47:23,490
People working...

3013
02:47:23,490 --> 02:47:24,230
For you.

3014
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:25,010
Or with you.

3015
02:47:25,150 --> 02:47:26,170
That have good connections.

3016
02:47:26,410 --> 02:47:27,590
And can help you do things.

3017
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:28,210
And...

3018
02:47:28,210 --> 02:47:29,430
Help you meet...

3019
02:47:29,430 --> 02:47:30,250
New companies.

3020
02:47:30,490 --> 02:47:31,170
And things like that.

3021
02:47:31,170 --> 02:47:31,590
And...

3022
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:32,210
I...

3023
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:34,030
I just want to be able to be...

3024
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:35,270
Uh...

3025
02:47:35,270 --> 02:47:36,770
You know, someone that you can...

3026
02:47:37,630 --> 02:47:38,030
Uh...

3027
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:38,910
Type of streamer.

3028
02:47:39,230 --> 02:47:40,010
A VTuber.

3029
02:47:40,170 --> 02:47:41,290
Your O-shi, if I am.

3030
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:42,730
Someone that you can be like...

3031
02:47:42,730 --> 02:47:43,650
My O-shi...

3032
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:45,910
She did that really cool thing!

3033
02:47:47,050 --> 02:47:47,450
And...

3034
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:48,530
Someone that you can be like...

3035
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:49,130
Oh my God...

3036
02:47:49,130 --> 02:47:50,230
She is...

3037
02:47:50,230 --> 02:47:51,790
Working with this company.

3038
02:47:51,970 --> 02:47:52,770
Or she is...

3039
02:47:53,690 --> 02:47:54,550
Doing this thing.

3040
02:47:54,670 --> 02:47:55,230
Or that thing.

3041
02:47:55,390 --> 02:47:56,170
Doing this concert.

3042
02:47:56,330 --> 02:47:56,630
Or whatever.

3043
02:47:57,450 --> 02:47:59,550
I want to be, you know...

3044
02:47:59,550 --> 02:48:00,690
Something like...

3045
02:48:00,690 --> 02:48:05,810
I want to be someone that you can... kind of... kind of gloat about.

3046
02:48:08,010 --> 02:48:09,590
Someone who does cool things.

3047
02:48:10,110 --> 02:48:16,150
But, you know, I obviously still have fun and I'm very happy to do just what I'm doing now.

3048
02:48:16,730 --> 02:48:21,630
But I, you know, always... I don't want to be stagnant.

3049
02:48:24,250 --> 02:48:26,270
And, you know...

3050
02:48:30,960 --> 02:48:32,620
We'll see what happens in the future.

3051
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:34,340
Obviously.

3052
02:48:35,380 --> 02:48:40,440
It's been really stressful because everything has been in such limbo for the past couple of weeks.

3053
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:43,860
For me, just not knowing.

3054
02:48:45,300 --> 02:48:49,560
When things change so fast, something would be told to me.

3055
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:52,960
And then the next day, something else would be told to me.

3056
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:58,560
And I would just be like, I... I can't... I can't follow anymore.

3057
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:05,340
But, you know, you guys have supported me through...

3058
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:07,420
Every step and so.

3059
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:11,020
Every step.

3060
02:49:13,720 --> 02:49:15,540
2020 to now.

3061
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:18,700
Five years.

3062
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,260
Resilient like a roach?

3063
02:49:25,700 --> 02:49:26,260
Ew!

3064
02:49:28,180 --> 02:49:29,780
Don't bring that...

3065
02:49:29,780 --> 02:49:31,420
Negative energy into here!

3066
02:49:35,860 --> 02:49:37,340
And, you know, in my...

3067
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:39,200
In my audition...

3068
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:42,180
I said I wanted to be...

3069
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:42,920
You know...

3070
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:43,600
Since I'm...

3071
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,300
Since I'm dead.

3072
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:46,700
Since I didn't get to live my life to the fullest.

3073
02:49:46,700 --> 02:49:47,760
I want to be...

3074
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,680
Someone that can help you.

3075
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:51,160
You know.

3076
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:54,720
You know, have lots of fun in your...

3077
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:55,980
Daily lives.

3078
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:56,940
So...

3079
02:49:56,940 --> 02:49:57,740
That...

3080
02:49:57,740 --> 02:49:59,460
Message has never changed for me.

3081
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:05,920
And so...

3082
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:08,120
I hope that I can keep being your...

3083
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:09,060
Your...

3084
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:10,120
Spooky ghost maid!

3085
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:12,020
Um...

3086
02:50:12,020 --> 02:50:13,040
For much, much longer.

3087
02:50:13,400 --> 02:50:15,280
Until you don't want me anymore.

3088
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:18,920
Will you still love me...

3089
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:21,420
When I'm no younger...

3090
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:21,840
Wait...

3091
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,180
Young...

3092
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:23,160
No...

3093
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:23,580
Wait...

3094
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:23,960
What's the word?

3095
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:24,520
Is this...

3096
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:26,280
Wait...

3097
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:27,760
Wait...

3098
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:29,420
No...

3099
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:30,400
Oh...

3100
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:30,740
No...

3101
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:31,400
Longer!

3102
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:34,940
I said younger!

3103
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:38,960
No...

3104
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:39,400
Forever 19!

3105
02:50:40,900 --> 02:50:42,140
I think I changed it...

3106
02:50:42,140 --> 02:50:43,740
Because you know how the joke is Forever 17?

3107
02:50:44,740 --> 02:50:45,740
And I was like...

3108
02:50:45,740 --> 02:50:47,440
Well, 19 has the teen in it.

3109
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:47,960
You know, like...

3110
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:49,720
To make it seem like it's...

3111
02:50:50,840 --> 02:50:51,280
Forever...

3112
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:52,420
Forever...

3113
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:53,360
17...

3114
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:53,820
But...

3115
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:54,440
Forever 19...

3116
02:50:54,440 --> 02:50:55,460
I can still play Eroge.

3117
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:59,920
And that's literally the only reason why it's Forever 7...

3118
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:00,400
Not 7...

3119
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:01,040
It's Forever 19.

3120
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:04,920
So that...

3121
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:07,680
So that I could still play Eroge and not get in trouble.

3122
02:51:13,700 --> 02:51:14,960
That's literally it!

3123
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:18,280
It's always been that way from the beginning!

3124
02:51:22,060 --> 02:51:22,540
Yeah...

3125
02:51:22,540 --> 02:51:23,940
Oh, thank you so much!

3126
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:24,900
Thank you, thank you!

3127
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:26,360
Thank you!

3128
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:27,080
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3129
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:28,700
I don't want to be...

3130
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:31,080
I don't want you guys to have to feel like you cheer me up!

3131
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:31,800
You guys...

3132
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:32,800
You guys...

3133
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:33,700
You're so funny!

3134
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:35,340
I'm always laughing every day!

3135
02:51:35,560 --> 02:51:37,980
I want to be the one to cheer you guys up if you need it!

3136
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:44,540
You guys are always making me laugh with your comments and everything!

3137
02:51:47,940 --> 02:51:49,140
That was so much fun!

3138
02:51:50,020 --> 02:51:50,400
Yeah!

3139
02:51:52,140 --> 02:51:53,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3140
02:51:55,840 --> 02:51:56,320
So...

3141
02:51:57,880 --> 02:51:59,760
Well, I'm glad we can have fun here!

3142
02:52:00,380 --> 02:52:01,520
And I hope you have fun!

3143
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:02,520
I hope so!

3144
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:05,340
I hope that my streams are at least a little entertaining!

3145
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:12,640
Shall we send it off in a classic...

3146
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:14,240
Classic Minky style?

3147
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:20,200
Classic Minky style!

3148
02:52:21,400 --> 02:52:23,580
How I've sent it off...

3149
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:25,540
