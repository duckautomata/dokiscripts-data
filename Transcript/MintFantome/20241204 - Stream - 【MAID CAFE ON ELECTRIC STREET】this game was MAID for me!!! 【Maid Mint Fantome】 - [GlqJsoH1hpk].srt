00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,170
Welcome!

2
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,990
Master!

3
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:52,950
Lady!

4
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,570
Hello!

5
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,990
Hi guys!

6
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,650
Hi!

7
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,390
Where are we walking?

8
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,450
I've just been looking at this...

9
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,910
At this menu and just kind of like taking in...

10
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,390
Like look!

11
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,150
That's actual Surugaia!

12
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,490
An actual maid dreaming!

13
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,750
Oh my gosh, family stop.

14
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,990
Welcome to membership!

15
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:22,850
Thank you!

16
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,970
How are you doing Mint?

17
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm good!

18
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,410
How are you guys?

19
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,710
How are you?

20
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,070
How are you?

21
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,050
How are you?

22
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,310
Welcome to Mint Cafe on Electric Street!

23
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,590
Ohayo!

24
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,570
Ohayo!

25
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,550
And look!

26
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,590
It's Magi... Magi... Magi...

27
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,390
Definitely not Mado Magi.

28
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,870
It's Magi...

29
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,710
Mado... Magi... Magi Mugu.

30
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,090
Yeah, I'm really excited to play this.

31
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,410
I don't really quite know much of anything about it.

32
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,010
Except that we're running a maid cafe.

33
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,410
And that's like my thing.

34
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,190
Welcome to membership!

35
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,390
Thank you!

36
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,470
Welcome to membership!

37
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,230
Thank you!

38
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,810
Seems like the wrong time of year for Sakura Blooms.

39
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,410
It's okay.

40
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,430
We are in spring.

41
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,690
It's to warm us up a little bit.

42
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,270
Since it's cold weather now, right?

43
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,270
Welcome!

44
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,510
Thanks for three months!

45
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,590
I hope I said your name right.

46
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,690
Extremely busy moving apartments.

47
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,470
Oh no!

48
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,550
Paperbacks!

49
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,570
Oh gosh, moving is such a hassle.

50
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,150
J-Rag!

51
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,790
Thanks for the donation!

52
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,510
Thank you!

53
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,030
Yeah, we have Woe Donalds.

54
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,030
And Softmap.

55
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,710
Fun.

56
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,650
It's funny, I had a lot of people being like...

57
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,550
Mint needs to play this game.

58
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,690
Like, you are...

59
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,570
You are maid cafe in Akihabara.

60
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,710
You must play.

61
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,190
But, I must actually you.

62
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,570
I must put on my nerd glasses and...

63
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,690
Actually...

64
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,770
Actually, this is not Akihabara.

65
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,470
In fact, this is Nihonbashi.

66
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,730
In Osaka.

67
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,210
And actually, I've never been before.

68
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,570
It's kind of like...

69
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,870
Called the Akihabara of Osaka.

70
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:32,770
Kind of.

71
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,690
But I've never been before, so...

72
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,210
I've actually never been to Osaka.

73
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,410
So, actually...

74
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,970
This is not Akihabara.

75
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,810
So you will not have me being like...

76
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,190
This place I recognized.

77
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,270
But maybe...

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,650
Maybe sometime when I go to Japan and I have time...

79
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,190
And I can go to Osaka.

80
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,490
Maybe then I can have a reverse situation.

81
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,570
You know, like for some people that watch my streams and are just like...

82
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,050
Oh, Minto talked about this place.

83
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,610
And then I went to Akihabara and I saw it.

84
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,770
That would be me.

85
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,550
I'll see it in this game.

86
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,390
And then I'll go to Akihabara...

87
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,730
Not Akihabara, Nihonbashi and I'll be like...

88
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,150
I recognize this from...

89
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,010
From Mint Cafe on Electric Street.

90
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,030
It's kind of a...

91
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,610
Maybe a rare opportunity for me.

92
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,710
Since I've been to Japan so many times.

93
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,070
So...

94
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,670
But I've never had a chance to make it over to Osaka.

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,870
I can't wait for my mint merch to arrive.

96
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,150
Thanks.

97
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,210
Thank you!

98
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,210
The moment I saw this game I thought of you.

99
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,010
I've been playing it myself.

100
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,010
It's very cute and fun!

101
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,010
I think you'll really love it.

102
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,150
Wow, thank you!

103
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:46,850
So...

105
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:48,990
Actually...

106
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,710
Playism sent me a code for this.

107
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,270
It's not sponsored.

108
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,110
In fact, I got the game from a friend.

109
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,750
But...

110
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,210
And then I saw that they had sent me a code.

111
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,430
But...

112
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,530
So...

113
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,090
I will still thank them for the code.

114
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,310
But...

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,510
Do we get a free pass to eat the Minky plushies?

116
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,230
Of course!

117
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,910
Please.

118
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,590
Oh my gosh.

119
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,350
I saw like the Ronald...

120
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,130
Sorry, the...

121
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,110
McWonald.

122
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,410
The Wonald McWonald.

123
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,030
He was so freaky.

124
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,310
But yeah!

125
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,630
So...

126
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,030
I guess let's just start the game.

127
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,750
It's kind of fun.

128
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,330
Wow.

129
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,270
Electric Street Rumors.

130
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,610
Doing part-time job...

131
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,150
Oh.

132
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,590
Employee number 996.

133
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,650
Something.

134
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,910
That's a Metal Gear reference.

135
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,810
Oh my god, my boss.

136
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,930
I can't read how long you spent in the bathroom.

137
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,650
4 minutes and 3 seconds.

138
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,590
Oh gosh.

139
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,710
It's one of those places.

140
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,230
That's me.

141
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,710
This guy right here.

142
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,170
I believe you are aware of the 3 minute rule in the employee manual.

143
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,670
Have you guys ever had a job like that?

144
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,950
I had a job once.

145
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,730
Where my boss, she would...

146
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,850
She would count how many minutes I was in the bathroom.

147
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,190
And also, if I laughed too loud, she would yell at me.

148
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,130
Thankfully, no.

149
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,190
Oh, you're so lucky.

150
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,870
You're so lucky.

151
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,450
It says clearly, 3 bathroom breaks a day, 3 minutes each.

152
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,310
But you don't seem to be following the rules.

153
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,230
I'm sure you're aware that the company has never been late with your salary payments.

154
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,030
I'm not one to buy merch ever, but I had to get the cheeky sticker.

155
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,790
It made me smile to see a side of you we don't see very often.

156
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,130
I appreciate...

157
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,430
I think that's very funny.

158
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,330
I'm glad...

159
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,990
I'm glad you liked it.

160
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,730
Nihonbashi is nicer to shop in.

161
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,690
Actually, the prices are generally lower than Akiba.

162
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,310
No speaking ill of Akiba in any way in this premises.

163
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,170
Listening from the bathroom at work.

164
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,110
Went to Osaka Nihonbashi back in March this year.

165
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,410
Feels more intimate than Akiba.

166
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,370
Less big streets.

167
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,170
I recommend visiting Racing Bar 100R.

168
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,370
I also have to go because that's where the other snake is.

169
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,590
Because he's at the other...

170
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,630
Super Potato.

171
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,610
There's the snake in the Super Potato in Akiba on the third floor.

172
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,070
I visit him every time.

173
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,470
And then there's the snake...

174
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,170
There's a big old snake...

175
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,130
Statue outside of the Super Potato in Osaka.

176
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,690
You have to kiss both snakes.

177
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,630
I will be...

178
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,750
Deported.

179
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,790
Can I deport a ghost?

180
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,450
I'll just...

181
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,850
Possess somebody.

182
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,410
And then...

183
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,010
That person can...

184
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,290
Get deported maybe.

185
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,930
Worth it.

186
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,570
I don't want Super Potato to close.

187
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,170
But the day that they do...

188
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,570
You know I will be in there saying...

189
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:38,850
Hey!

190
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,850
You selling that guy?

191
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,090
Hey...

192
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,690
You wanna auction off?

193
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,810
I would win.

194
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,130
If there's an auction...

195
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,130
You guys, I'm sorry.

196
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,930
You will know where your donors go to.

197
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,210
I'm so sorry.

198
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,690
I will buy another plane ticket.

199
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,930
For him to sit with me on the plane.

200
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,890
We expected of you.

201
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,390
I'm saving up my money for that moment.

202
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,410
Every minto plushie you buy goes towards the snake retirement fund.

203
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,690
In my house.

204
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,690
The transparency is appreciated of course.

205
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,010
But how about you?

206
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,430
You can't even follow the simplest of rules.

207
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,590
Therefore your salary for today will be deducted from your paycheck this month.

208
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,910
I'll be keeping an eye on you, punk.

209
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,750
I really hope there won't be a next time.

210
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,850
But if there is...

211
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,430
That will be the end of your time here.

212
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,990
Got it?

213
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,450
This place doesn't even...

214
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,810
They don't even have windows.

215
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,390
Snake fund.

216
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,130
Trash boat.

217
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,030
And Mango the cat.

218
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,730
Thank you.

219
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,590
That reminds me.

220
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,810
There's an urgent assignment for you.

221
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,250
I want to see it done by the end of the day.

222
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,450
Oh, the day.

223
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,410
Now back to your desk and get to work.

224
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,630
Number 996.

225
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,770
Okay.

226
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,430
Have you guys ever seen those like places...

227
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,090
They have like...

228
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,670
They create giant skylight looking lights.

229
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:33,190
Like light panels for apartments and office buildings that don't have actual windows.

230
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,430
It just feels even more...

231
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,490
I don't want to say dystopian.

232
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,110
But it just feels, you know.

233
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,410
Baby Cori, thanks for the gift.

234
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,810
Movement.

235
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:44,590
Okay.

236
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,950
Confirm with the Z.

237
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,350
Oh, interact.

238
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,170
Was it Z or A?

239
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,690
Cancel with X.

240
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,810
Oh, I can just leave?

241
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,490
I can't take it anymore.

242
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,250
Oh my god, employee 997.

243
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,330
Sorry, my head is blocking the names a little bit.

244
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,130
I might have to move or...

245
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,750
Maybe I'll shrink the screen a little bit.

246
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,390
I never bought an opi mousepad until last time.

247
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:17,400
I hope you enjoyed it.

248
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,340
Super Ray, thanks for 5 months.

249
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,140
My head is gonna explode.

250
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,840
He is dead now?

251
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,880
The guy next to me hasn't moved a muscle for hours.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh god.

253
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,960
He must be exhausted from the boss chewing him out.

254
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,300
But still...

255
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,220
Is he...

256
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,180
Alive?

257
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,940
I sure hope so.

258
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
Oh my god, employee 404.

259
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,400
Oh no.

260
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,040
This was employee 985.

261
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,420
Let's see.

262
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,180
Oh, employee 811648.

263
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,620
I wonder if there is any...

264
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,640
Like, you know how with numbers you can make...

265
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,920
Like, words in Japanese.

266
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,300
And 404 seems like a joke.

267
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,940
404, yeah, fatal error.

268
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,960
But I wonder what 811648 is.

269
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm not very good at, like, the...

270
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,560
Not leet-speak.

271
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,520
Yes, I watched that Conan episode.

272
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,140
It's not even...

273
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,160
Yeah, the Goro Awase.

274
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,020
It's not even just a Conan thing.

275
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,440
But I did watch that episode too.

276
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,180
Because it's really...

277
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,020
I think of it all the time because it's really funny.

278
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,560
Prisoner 24609.

279
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm going to eat the plushie.

280
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,720
Do it.

281
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,560
Do it.

282
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,320
Fill it with chili.

283
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,300
Yeah.

284
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,200
811...

285
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
I don't know.

286
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm not good at them at all.

287
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,760
Damn it.

288
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,660
I think this place is a black company.

289
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,620
I have a sneaking suspicion.

290
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,380
Employee 807.

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,820
Hello, honey?

292
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,060
I'm still at the office.

293
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,960
Yes, I know.

294
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,660
But...

295
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,060
Can?

296
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,280
I think.

297
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
Can we talk about our date after work?

298
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,020
I know, I know.

299
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,160
If I can get even a single day off this week, I promise I'll spend it with you.

300
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,660
Okay?

301
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,900
I won't stand you up this time.

302
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,400
I promise.

303
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,860
Please, believe in me.

304
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,760
Just this once.

305
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,580
Hello?

306
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,400
Hello?

307
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,120
Can you hear me?

308
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,620
Oh my god!

309
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:31,940
No!

310
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,740
This guy!

311
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,620
Oh wait, that's Kan...

312
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,180
That's not O.

313
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,640
That's Kan...

314
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,400
I don't know.

315
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,760
I don't know the kanji.

316
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
Kan something.

317
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,620
Minto would be employee 310.

318
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,540
Yes, I would.

319
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,320
It's all...

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,800
Oh no!

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,580
This guy.

322
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,200
This poor guy.

323
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,540
Hey, are you alright?

324
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,080
Oh, this is employee 711.

325
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,020
That guy counted the exact number of times I went to the vending machine.

326
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,700
What is he?

327
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,660
A stalker or something?

328
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,540
Besides, is that his whole job?

329
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,580
Just to monitor us all day?

330
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,640
Does that mean I'll do that if I get promoted in the future?

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,020
By the way, I've been using a dating app while he's not looking.

332
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,240
But I just realized that I have absolutely no time to go on dates.

333
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,820
Because of this stupid job.

334
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,120
And I'm paying for that app the whole time.

335
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,160
I just really want a girlfriend, man.

336
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,420
But I don't have time.

337
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,660
This is so sad.

338
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,420
If you want to know how long someone's been in the company, here's a pro tip.

339
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,640
The bolder they are, the longer their time here.

340
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,660
99% accuracy.

341
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,640
Everyone here is looking pretty...

342
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,220
Even us.

343
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,880
Look, we're kind of...

344
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,760
We look like Araragi-kun.

345
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,620
We're the main character.

346
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
Oh, Yuki.

347
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
Did you just get an urgent assignment?

348
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,640
Tough luck, dude.

349
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,260
Looks like you'll be here all night again.

350
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,350
Listen, here's some advice from your senior.

351
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,670
Slack off when he's not looking.

352
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,770
If you can't do that, you won't last long.

353
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,190
Neither physically nor mentally.

354
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,250
Now get back to work before he starts complaining again.

355
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,050
No!

356
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,990
I'm a free spirit.

357
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,230
Also, I see we have a...

358
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,970
We have nothing in our bag.

359
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,410
What if I just leave?

360
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,770
You should go back to work.

361
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,350
Back and work at your desk.

362
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,770
Back to work.

363
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,470
I feel like I'm watching a horror game.

364
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,870
He's not looking.

365
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,370
I'm slacking.

366
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,570
Finally, he's gone.

367
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,050
Start standing at the door right around the end of the workday.

368
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,130
Every day!

369
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,770
Oh, Yuki is about to lose it.

370
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,550
So that he can make sure you clock out first.

371
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,090
And then go back to work.

372
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,910
That's...

373
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,170
That's what?

374
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,630
It's 21 PM.

375
00:17:58,930 --> 00:17:59,690
I know, right?

376
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,250
21 o'clock.

377
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:01,810
What is that?

378
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,190
9?

379
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,810
Oh, right.

380
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,770
Wanna grab a drink later?

381
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,330
What?

382
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,070
You still have work?

383
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:08,630
Come on.

384
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,190
We can both tell it's not something you can finish in a day.

385
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,290
That assignment is pretty much meaningless anyway.

386
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,090
He's just trying to get under your skin.

387
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,930
You're not going?

388
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,850
Sure.

389
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,770
But you don't look so good.

390
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,450
I'll be off, but you be careful, okay?

391
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,670
Are we gonna get Isekai to...

392
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,710
Maid Cafe World?

393
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,270
I finally finished my work for today.

394
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,850
Press confirm at the door to leave the office.

395
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,450
Oh, we're not the only one left here.

396
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,030
Observe?

397
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,530
What is this?

398
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,170
Work's over.

399
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,590
You should go back to your dorm room.

400
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,190
A dorm room?

401
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:39,990
Am I a student?

402
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,290
Employee 404 is fucking dead.

403
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,430
Oh, you're leaving?

404
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,590
Okay, see you tomorrow.

405
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,650
Wait, no.

406
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,010
See you today, I guess.

407
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,570
It's 1 AM!

408
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,070
I'll be sleeping here tonight.

409
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,050
If I go home, I'd have no time to sleep at all.

410
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,550
Off you go.

411
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,750
Rest whenever you can.

412
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,230
Got it?

413
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,750
What is this?

414
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,390
The death march or something?

415
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,910
This is why maid cafes are so...

416
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,830
Oh my gosh, it's raining.

417
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,330
We don't even have an umbrella.

418
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,510
Hello, can this diamond dog get a birthday salad from VTubers?

419
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,130
Yes, gross hair!

420
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,630
I thought it was Hotaru no Hikari for a second.

421
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,270
Happy birthday!

422
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,250
Congratulations!

423
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,350
Happy birthday with salutations!

424
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,170
Happy birthday!

425
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,050
May your sky stay blue!

426
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,410
Happy birthday to you!

427
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:45,990
Gross hair!

428
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:46,990
Happy birthday!

429
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,090
The music is so sweet.

430
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,650
You drag your exhausted body out of the office...

431
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,810
only to realize that it's raining heavily outside.

432
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,290
Good thing I brought an umbrella.

433
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,590
I did bring an umbrella.

434
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,370
You open your umbrella and walk against the wind.

435
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,950
The streets are eerily empty in the middle of the night.

436
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,590
A strong wind drained your stamina.

437
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,370
The second your concentration wanes, your umbrella is whipped out of your hands.

438
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,430
Losing your balance and being unable to see clearly through the rain, you trip on something and fall over.

439
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,350
I like these movies, how you have Kill Bill and then the girl who...

440
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,790
Oh wait, my head is blocking it!

441
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,690
Here, hold on for a second.

442
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,430
I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller.

443
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,200
Is that too... Is that easy enough to see?

444
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,840
Hopefully.

445
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,040
Maybe... Hold on, I want my background.

446
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,060
Is it okay?

447
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,580
Is it good?

448
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,340
Is it good?

449
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,700
Okay.

450
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh my gosh, Cosmic, welcome to membership!

451
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,280
And Zealous!

452
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,420
Zealous, welcome to membership.

453
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,040
Thank you guys.

454
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,800
Yeah, Tokyo Kakeru Shoujo!

455
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,040
Like, actually my favorite movie ever.

456
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
You struggle to stand back up.

457
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,700
Your umbrella is lost to the winds.

458
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,380
And so the rain pelts relentlessly on your shoulders.

459
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,560
This is so sad.

460
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,720
Oh, woah, look at the rain.

461
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,560
It goes in whatever direction I'm going in.

462
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,260
Let's see.

463
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,300
Cinema.

464
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,900
It's so cold.

465
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,260
I have to get to the station.

466
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,300
Why don't we stop in Wodonald's first?

467
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm so sleepy.

468
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,420
I have to tough it out.

469
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,900
I'm almost there.

470
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,420
Oh my gosh.

471
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,840
No, we have to make it.

472
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,940
Here, we are at the train station.

473
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,240
What about... Let's just go in.

474
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,640
I like... It's almost...

475
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,880
This is the Hotaru no Hikari.

476
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,960
You have no recollection of how you managed to get on the train, or how you reached your dorm.

477
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,020
You only remember opening the door to your dorm groggily and collapsing on your bed, your eyelids closing on their own.

478
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh.

479
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,800
But in what feels like the blink of an eye, the alarm clock next to your bed starts ringing incessantly.

480
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,040
You feel just as, if not even more tired than the day before.

481
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,100
This is too real!

482
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,840
I don't like this!

483
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,640
You're going to be late!

484
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,300
It hurts.

485
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,140
Number 996.

486
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,000
Unbelievable.

487
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,460
You failed to follow another basic rule.

488
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,180
You're late.

489
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,260
You're 3 minutes and 20 seconds... No, 3 minutes and 21 seconds late.

490
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:16,620
As said in the 3 minute rule section in the employee manual, every 3 minutes of tardiness is punishable by deducting 3... 3... 3 days worth of pay!

491
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,800
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

492
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,160
Thanks for the 10 gift card!

493
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,120
3 days.

494
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,680
You slacked off in the toilet yesterday and now you're late to drill it in that really thick skull of yours.

495
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,440
I'm cutting your paycheck by 50% this month!

496
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,520
The deducted amount will be added to my paycheck!

497
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,780
I'm going to lose it.

498
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,360
I'm going to burn this building down.

499
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,640
Kill him!

500
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,660
Kill him!

501
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,700
Murder is okay!

502
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,520
Says the ghost.

503
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,880
Don't like it?

504
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,780
Then get out of here.

505
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,180
There's plenty more vermin like you scurrying around in the streets.

506
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,380
You're paying for a precious life lesson so you can grow as a person.

507
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,960
When you think of it that way, it's dirt cheap, isn't it?

508
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,520
After enough lessons and some strict telling off, you'll grow into a proper man.

509
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,800
Someday you'll regret not thanking me more.

510
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,620
Do you understand?

511
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,040
Keep it up, Minto.

512
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,080
Your tardiness is costing the company billions.

513
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,960
This company is a family and we all need to pull our...

514
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,180
No, I... we're not going to be whipped around by this guy.

515
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,180
No, I don't!

516
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,640
Bagging groceries doesn't sound so bad.

517
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,420
That's what I'm saying.

518
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,240
I didn't catch that.

519
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,040
Come again?

520
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,920
I quit!

521
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,500
You quit?

522
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,560
Oh my gosh, everybody in the office.

523
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,620
Do you really think anyone else is going to hire you?

524
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,840
You'll come crawling back to me in three days time.

525
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,080
This guy is obsessed with threes.

526
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,920
It's not too late to take it back, you know?

527
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,280
I am a forgiving man.

528
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,200
I quit!

529
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,380
You really think you can quit just like that?

530
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,560
The work you haven't done is going to be pushed onto your colleagues.

531
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,600
You know that, right?

532
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,200
Don't you want your salary?

533
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,020
I can take back the 50% reduction if you insist.

534
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
I can't take it anymore!

535
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,340
We're standing up for ourselves.

536
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,760
You still have work to do.

537
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,400
Get back to your desk.

538
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,780
You do it!

539
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,400
Oh my gosh, this guy is really... 404 is missing.

540
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,460
Fine!

541
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,640
Then screw him!

542
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,440
You have three days.

543
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,960
Three days to pack your things and get the hell out of the employee dorms.

544
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,960
Oh god, I'm homeless!

545
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,140
Our company doesn't need a rule breaking piece of trash.

546
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,340
Who doesn't even know how to say thank you?

547
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,010
Goodbye, it was nice knowing you all.

548
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,290
Leave the rest to me.

549
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,690
I'll keep in touch.

550
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,710
I wish you all the best.

551
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,530
Great job!

552
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,690
Maybe you didn't notice, but everyone liked that.

553
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,750
Did you see his face when you talked back to him?

554
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,350
It was straight up cathartic.

555
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,230
You're my hero!

556
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,430
Congrats to your freedom!

557
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,170
Hell yeah!

558
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,150
I quit too!

559
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,490
Good luck out there.

560
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,250
You're amazing!

561
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,310
Oh my gosh, I'm living on this high right now.

562
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,410
Get lost!

563
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,490
Alright!

564
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,650
Live for good!

565
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,470
And Draco's next to the 30 gifted!

566
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,830
Who just clapped?

567
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,370
Fess up!

568
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,310
You have lost your job.

569
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,570
Your new life has begun.

570
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,350
I lost my job!

571
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,050
Oh, I cleared chapter 1.

572
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,490
The convenience store wasn't hiring either.

573
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,570
That's okay.

574
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,390
That's fine.

575
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,430
Yeah, we're unemployed!

576
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,350
I don't have much in savings, so I need to get a new job soon.

577
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,810
And a place to stay too.

578
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,770
Oh, someone's calling me.

579
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,790
It's been a whole day already, huh?

580
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,990
Have you found a new... Oh, this is Senpai.

581
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,610
Talking to us.

582
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,510
Have you found a new job or a place to stay yet?

583
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,350
No?

584
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,790
Yeah, that makes sense.

585
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,070
It was way too sudden.

586
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,010
I don't know if we can be in need if we don't have a home.

587
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,090
You've got to find a place to stay first.

588
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,250
If you don't move out by the third day...

589
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,370
You know who is probably going to toss your belongings into the trash...

590
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,270
And then charge you a disposal fee or something.

591
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,270
Don't worry though.

592
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,090
I'll figure out a way to hide your stuff.

593
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,830
Is that May Dreamin?

594
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,590
It is!

595
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,070
It is actually May Dreamin.

596
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,990
And this is actually Tsurugaya.

597
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,150
Crazy.

598
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,270
Oh my gosh, Moe books!

599
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,750
Moe is justice.

600
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,610
Don't mention it.

601
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,330
You should take the opportunity to get some rest.

602
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,110
We can hang out again once you've settled down.

603
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,510
Oops, 2 minutes and 45 seconds and ticking.

604
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,310
I'll be off.

605
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,150
Talk to you again soon.

606
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,490
That must be Yuki then, probably.

607
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,070
It's still pretty early.

608
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,250
I should look around some more.

609
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,510
Maybe find a place to rest.

610
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,290
Do you guys hear the...

611
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,350
Oh my gosh, it's just like a family mart.

612
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,890
The cats!

613
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,870
Hello master.

614
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,130
Miracle Mint Cafe at your service.

615
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,770
Would you like to pay us a visit?

616
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,750
There's a special event going on today.

617
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,630
Look at the otaku over here.

618
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,270
That's me.

619
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,190
Yes.

620
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,230
Yay!

621
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,170
I have no money, but that's ok.

622
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,190
Our cafe is on the west side of this street.

623
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,830
Just go straight and you'll see it.

624
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,010
We'll be waiting for you.

625
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,590
Ok, but a maid...

626
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,910
You're not really doing your job though.

627
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,310
A maid would guide me to the cafe.

628
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,310
Excuse me?

629
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,030
Excuse me?

630
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,650
A maid would be like, oh, you want to come?

631
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,210
Ok, let me lead you to the place.

632
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,130
And they would be very pushy about it.

633
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,670
A maid cafe.

634
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:28,870
That sounds nice.

635
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,230
Maybe I'll go check it out.

636
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,750
Wait, what's inside Tsurugaya?

637
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,530
Maybe I should check out the maid cafe first.

638
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,090
Look at these.

639
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,930
That's a gacha!

640
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,170
They look like they're having so much fun, but I can't cave in.

641
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,830
I'll come back when I have the money.

642
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:46,790
Sad.

643
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,930
They are having so much fun.

644
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,470
Hey, do you guys want to be...

645
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,490
Do you want to be nakama?

646
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,390
Do you want to be your tomodachis?

647
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,010
There's a road.

648
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,450
There's a road work up ahead.

649
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,290
So this road is blocked off for now.

650
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,870
I'm sorry for the trouble, but please check another path.

651
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,610
Miracle maid cafe.

652
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,330
Wait, what are these otakus saying?

653
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,610
That's me.

654
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,450
Literally me.

655
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,410
This guy right here.

656
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:15,890
What?

657
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,310
Hanging out, loitering outside the maid cafe?

658
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,570
Arcade.

659
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,770
I'd love to play once I've gotten a new job.

660
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,930
Okay, let's blow all of our money at the maid cafe first.

661
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,930
I'm terribly sorry, master.

662
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,170
The cafe is full right now.

663
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,790
You'll have to line up outside.

664
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,150
Oh, they're not loitering.

665
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,510
They're lined up.

666
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,650
It's gonna say that maid isn't hustling you for all your cash and being pushy about getting you inside.

667
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,770
So you have to pay out of courtesy.

668
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,650
They're not like... They're not...

669
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,010
I wouldn't say hustling.

670
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,910
As an apology, please take this free trial ticket.

671
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:56,830
Please come again.

672
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,550
Free trial ticket?

673
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,590
Just because I have to wait outside?

674
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,350
Hey, fellow otaku.

675
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,710
Did you go inside just now?

676
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,170
How's it like in there?

677
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,010
Any seats?

678
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,970
No, huh?

679
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,730
I'll just have to keep waiting.

680
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,630
It's full again and doesn't look like I'll get a seat anytime soon.

681
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,550
That's why I said we should've come earlier.

682
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,310
It's your fault for wasting half a day in Tsurugaya.

683
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,710
Good otaku voice.

684
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,190
Thank you.

685
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:28,950
You're...

686
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,590
Oh wait, sorry.

687
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,570
I think I've been reading it as the big...

688
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,150
It says big guy, but I've been reading it as the one guy's voice the whole time.

689
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,850
You're the one who refused to leave the arcade.

690
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,450
Are you lining up for Miracle 2?

691
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,650
Join the gang.

692
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,930
Oh right, I've heard that there's another cafe in the westmost part of the street.

693
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,850
Why don't you go scout it out?

694
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,570
Scrawny guy.

695
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,230
Why me?

696
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,370
You go.

697
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,290
I've been walking all day, man.

698
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,470
I don't want to move.

699
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,490
Your head keeps covering the names.

700
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:01,970
I know!

701
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,970
I'm sorry.

702
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,110
Here, I'll just...

703
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,950
I'll just go down here, okay?

704
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,650
Is this better?

705
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,230
Is this better?

706
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,550
Scrawny guy.

707
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,210
Again.

708
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,530
Westmost part.

709
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,450
I'm a little tired.

710
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,410
If only there was a place I could sit down and take a break.

711
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,270
So, this is west, right?

712
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,280
What do you mean upper left?

713
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,170
What if it's east?

714
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,370
What if they were all wrong and they meant east?

715
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,270
Our cafe is on the west side of this street.

716
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,610
Just go straight and you'll see it.

717
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,790
We'll be waiting for you.

718
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,830
Oh man.

719
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,830
Wait, I can sit here!

720
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,850
East.

721
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,190
This is a nice, like, wallpaper.

722
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,170
You know?

723
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,010
Gosh, I love pixel art so much.

724
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,250
That's why I love my ending screen so much.

725
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,790
It looks so good.

726
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,930
I'm zooming.

727
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,850
Oh my god, I'm, like, speedwalking.

728
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,430
The speed of light.

729
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,470
Nihonbashi station.

730
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,790
Train station.

731
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,270
And this gentleman is Mayoshi.

732
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,410
Made hair fat.

733
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,210
I keep logging the names, okay?

734
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,070
Okay, maybe like this.

735
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,590
I'm just peeking.

736
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,750
Is it Whack Donald's?

737
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,710
Oh my god, this guy is so freaky.

738
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,870
Oh, I can go in!

739
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,610
Sorry, we don't have any empty positions right now.

740
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,490
Okay.

741
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,090
Okay.

742
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:12,490
Cinema.

743
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,110
Oh my god.

744
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,590
Are they kissing?

745
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,210
Sorry, but you'll have to try somewhere else.

746
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,670
But the Mugumagi movie.

747
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,230
I want to see it.

748
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,850
Who wants their Minto back?

749
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,710
Wait, this kind of looks like me.

750
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,750
This... the not Sayaka.

751
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,510
Not Sayaka kind of looks like me.

752
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,810
So green, right?

753
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,850
We're not hiring right now.

754
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,290
Sorry.

755
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,910
Are you a restaurant?

756
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,830
High class restaurant?

757
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,270
Oh.

758
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,190
Yes, we're hiring, but we're looking for a certified chef.

759
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,410
Oh, dang.

760
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,130
Leave?

761
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,710
Okay, we can keep going.

762
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,960
This is the cafe they were talking about?

763
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,640
The door is open, so I guess I'll go in.

764
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,540
Oh, so the other cafe is like the super fancy... The other cafe is like at home.

765
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
And this one is like the...

766
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,800
The like, you know...

767
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,600
The not so great... The what?

768
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,720
It's a bit run down.

769
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,440
Those are your words.

770
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,740
Those are your words.

771
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,440
Let's see.

772
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,300
Fuwa Fuwa.

773
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,020
Mid cafe.

774
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,400
Ghost made of the lake.

775
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,120
What is your wisdom?

776
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,620
What do you mean of the lake?

777
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,600
Oh no!

778
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
What do I do?

779
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,720
At this rate the cafe will have to close down for good.

780
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,900
I have to find a new manager.

781
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,880
And fast!

782
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,240
A customer?

783
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,020
Oh no!

784
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,680
What do I do?

785
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,220
Oh my gosh, he's hiding.

786
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,820
The store is so quiet.

787
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,200
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.

788
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,680
Greet!

789
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,120
I'll take a look around before I go.

790
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,320
What do you mean go?

791
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,600
Did you not intend on eating?

792
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,040
I'm observing.

793
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,780
The tables look old, but they're clean and in good shape.

794
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,220
What is this?

795
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,440
What are these decorations?

796
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,540
They have a summoning area.

797
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,960
This is where they draw the pentagram.

798
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,860
They have... The wallpaper is so old it looks like it's about to peel off in places.

799
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:12,660
Hold on, I'm gonna turn the music just down like 1.

800
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,800
I think it should be good.

801
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,360
Can I go in here?

802
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,140
The lounge.

803
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,920
This cabinet must be antique.

804
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,940
The old fashioned design really adds to the atmosphere.

805
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,180
Is that where they summon you?

806
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,600
Yes.

807
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,960
This maid character looks like mint dipped in ink.

808
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,360
What do you mean by that?

809
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,900
The maids are sad, but it will be OK as soon as you apply the topically administered vaccine.

810
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,600
I know what you're talking about.

811
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,020
What about this fridge?

812
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,860
You've been walking all day.

813
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,460
Maybe you should sit down and take a break.

814
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,500
We're just making it like it's our home.

815
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,740
For years, you spent your life in the frantic war zone of a toxic workplace.

816
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,480
But now, it's as if time itself has slowed down.

817
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,620
Mink?

818
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,860
What do you mean mink?

819
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,640
Ink to mint?

820
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,600
Oh, mink?

821
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
You lift your head and look around.

822
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,520
Hopefully you'll be able to relax for a moment.

823
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,520
There's something about this place that makes it so comfortable and warm, as if you were far, far away from the source of your worries.

824
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,240
I love maid cafes.

825
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,720
I love maid cafes!

826
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,440
The wallpaper is falling apart just like your maid cafe when you came back before the renovations.

827
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,100
Oh my gosh, wait!

828
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,680
The wallpaper of this store looks like my gaming background!

829
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,840
Oh my god!

830
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,380
The stripes!

831
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,340
It looks the same!

832
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,340
Oh my god!

833
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,380
My immersion!

834
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,480
You're starting to get sleepy.

835
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,680
Sleepy!

836
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,280
Oh my god, you just fall asleep here.

837
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,900
Check it!

838
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,340
Cute

839
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,280
You'll catch a cold if you sleep here.

840
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,460
Wake up!

841
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,180
Please wake up!

842
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,700
Oh my god, she's so cute!

843
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,560
Look, she even has a hair thing just like me.

844
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,220
Like a little hair barrette on the same side even.

845
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,260
Is this what I would look like if I were human?

846
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,440
I wonder...

847
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,020
Oh, you're up!

848
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,040
Thank goodness!

849
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,220
Good afternoon, master!

850
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,820
I'm one of the maids here.

851
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,640
That's me.

852
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,060
I saw you slumped over the table and got a little worried.

853
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,500
You weren't moving at all for a bit, so I'm just here to make sure you're okay.

854
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,220
You were sleeping so soundly.

855
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,520
I can only imagine how tired you must be.

856
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,760
Same eye color too.

857
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,300
I think this is how I would look if I were human!

858
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,760
Oh my gosh!

859
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,240
I wonder if I would have black hair if I were human.

860
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,780
But you can't sleep here.

861
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,660
You'll catch a cold.

862
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:13,060
Literally Danny Fett It's best to work hard, rest well, and live a healthy life.

863
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,660
He

864
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,400
even has the same last name as me!

865
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,820
Except it's spelled different.

866
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,620
Not the Danny Fett.

867
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,620
No way.

868
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,380
If you're really exhausted, you should go home and get some proper rest.

869
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,320
It's important to maintain a good work-life balance.

870
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,180
Actually, I wanted to tell you that you can stay here a little longer.

871
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,420
Actually, I'm on a break right now, so I don't have anything to serve you.

872
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,740
But we're not actually open at the moment, so we don't have anything to serve you.

873
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,820
Wait, then why did that maid... Maybe they... I think the maid meant the other place.

874
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,240
Her uniform's different.

875
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,080
I think the maid meant the one that was packed.

876
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,860
Her hair clips are even mint colored.

877
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,120
You're right!

878
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,740
Oh my god.

879
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,980
We got to put mint into that machine that brings ghosts back to life from Casper the movie.

880
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,920
Would you guys still like me even if I were human though?

881
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,800
Maybe you're too used to ghost mint though.

882
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,260
If I were human, would I even be mint?

883
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,280
I wonder.

884
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,860
Would that be my name?

885
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,840
I don't know.

886
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,300
Don't let it go!

887
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,960
The fastest no ever.

888
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,400
If someday the cafe reopens, please come again.

889
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,580
Are we getting kicked out?

890
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,720
Oh, we're both bouncing.

891
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,840
Wait, I want to join.

892
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,610
That was fun.

893
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm just saying we can touch human mint though for no particular reason.

894
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,700
What do you mean by that?

895
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,360
Content I joined the channel for.

896
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,720
If someday

897
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,570
the cafe reopens, please come again.

898
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,530
Please wait a moment.

899
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:27,110
Master, we can make a lot of Fuwafuwa specials, what do you think?

900
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,270
Thank you so much.

901
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,690
Please wait here master.

902
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,010
Oh my gosh, we're in!

903
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:45,690
We're in!

904
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,970
The Fuwafuwa special!

905
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,410
Why isn't the coffee grinder moving?

906
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,570
Oh, it wasn't plugged in.

907
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,590
Oh god, what is happening in the kitchen?

908
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,850
Now I just push this button to grind the beans, right?

909
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,330
The beans flew out!

910
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,410
Oh no, the powder is getting everywhere!

911
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,430
What do I do?

912
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,980
How do I use this big huge machine again?

913
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,880
Alright, the instruction manual.

914
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,880
Oh god, it's...

915
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,120
Oh no, it's in German!

916
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,880
She can't read it.

917
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,360
100% past life Minky.

918
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,220
Stop it!

919
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,300
Yeah!

920
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,200
Oh well, I guess I'll just add the ground coffee in here.

921
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,580
What was that sound?

922
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,080
What was that sound?

923
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,740
It's OK master.

924
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,460
I have everything under control.

925
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,340
Please wait just a little longer.

926
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,340
Even from the other side of the counter, you can tell she's having a hard time.

927
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,500
Lend her a hand?

928
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,740
No, I want to watch her struggle.

929
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,320
What is it this time?

930
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,080
That's strange.

931
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,060
I swear I followed the instructions.

932
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,980
I hope nothing explodes.

933
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,900
She seems to be having a hard time.

934
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,960
Lend her a hand?

935
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,540
No.

936
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,940
What is it this time?

937
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:00,960
That's strange.

938
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,480
I swear I followed the instructions.

939
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,420
Oh OK, she just repeats.

940
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,680
Lend her a hand.

941
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,260
I guess we have to.

942
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,120
Are you offering to help?

943
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,520
Thank you.

944
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,960
I'll leave it up to you then.

945
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,660
What do you mean leave it up to me?

946
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,380
Oh my gosh.

947
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,480
Let's see.

948
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:36,920
OK.

949
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,060
According to the owner's recipe, the base for a Fuwa Fuwa Special is an espresso.

950
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,120
Sounds good.

951
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,380
Then you add some milk and cinnamon to taste and you're done.

952
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,700
By a Sabrina Carpenter?

953
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,400
That's me espresso.

954
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,840
We have ground coffee and cinnamon.

955
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,980
And I just bought a carton of milk today.

956
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,060
Choose the base first.

957
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,680
What if I did the wrong thing?

958
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,720
Espresso.

959
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,300
Add.

960
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,540
Then add some milk and a dash of cinnamon.

961
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,900
Milk.

962
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,900
And cinnamon.

963
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,220
Confirm.

964
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,760
Cute!

965
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,000
Baby Corrin, thanks for the five gifted!

966
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,720
Wow, is this really your first time?

967
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,640
You're so talented master!

968
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,400
Serve.

969
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,860
Guys, this might be the kind of service you get when you come to my maid cafe.

970
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:52,860
Is that OK?

971
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,080
You have to make your own drink.

972
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,540
You have to make your own food.

973
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,060
I just kind of stand there and say, wow, good job!

974
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,140
It's a BYOB.

975
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,460
Bring your own...

976
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,540
Wait, BYOH.

977
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,780
Bring your own hands.

978
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,740
Oh wait, sorry, you're the customer.

979
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,020
You're the one who should be served.

980
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,520
Please take a seat master and I'll bring the coffee to you right away.

981
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,740
Is she going to bless it with some moe moe magic?

982
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,760
You and the maid finished making the cup of coffee together.

983
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,120
Thank you for waiting master.

984
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,000
Here is your Fuwa Fuwa special.

985
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,860
Enjoy!

986
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,880
She just goes...

987
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,440
BYOB.

988
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,440
Be your own butler.

989
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,780
That's good!

990
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,480
That's good!

991
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,760
Warm steam wafts from the cup of coffee, as well as a familiar aroma that fills the room.

992
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,100
BYO is OK.

993
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,060
Being in Minto's presence is enough.

994
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,420
Bring your own hands?

995
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,860
I'd rather hold yours!

996
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,990
That's against the rules!

997
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,640
What maid-related activity took you to the great cafe in the sky?

998
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,380
Carefully take a sip.

999
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,660
It's still a little hot.

1000
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,020
It starts off a bit bitter, but then it slowly mellows out.

1001
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,160
The aroma from the cinnamon and the touch of sweetness from the milk rounds out the flavor perfectly.

1002
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,060
I hope it doesn't taste weird.

1003
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,360
I've rarely been in the kitchen.

1004
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,180
You really helped me out just now.

1005
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,540
Thank you very much.

1006
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm Kamigishi Shiro.

1007
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,480
I'm a maid of this cafe.

1008
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,840
I'm Shiro Kamigishi.

1009
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,200
I'm a maid of this cafe.

1010
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,020
The customers call me Shiro.

1011
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,680
I've been working here the longest.

1012
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,800
That said, I'm the only one working here right now.

1013
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,500
Once in a while?

1014
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,500
I come here every once in a while to clean, so I thought that I might as well put the dress on while I'm at it.

1015
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:17,760
I was surprised to find myself hiding under the counter.

1016
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,800
I'm sorry.

1017
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,100
This is a maid cafe called Fuwafuwa.

1018
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,120
This is Fuwafuwa maid cafe.

1019
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,980
It's not very big, but it's one of the oldest shops on Electric Street.

1020
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,960
We've been closed for a while now, though.

1021
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,400
What should I ask?

1022
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,040
Oh my gosh.

1023
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,420
Why are you closed?

1024
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,540
She's very Fuwafuwa.

1025
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,460
Because the owner's gone off somewhere.

1026
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,000
I knew her voice sounded familiar.

1027
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,040
Ikumi Hasegawa.

1028
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,700
Voice of Kita Ikuyo from Bochi the Rock.

1029
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,900
Ubel the Armpit Girl.

1030
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,180
She's been reduced to Armpit Girl from Freerun.

1031
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,040
No way.

1032
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,480
Wow.

1033
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,780
It's kind of stacked.

1034
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,520
I wonder what other seiyuu are in this then.

1035
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,680
That's crazy.

1036
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,160
I'm making the weebs mandatory Tokyo trip.

1037
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Are there maid cafes for those who are Nihongo nozu?

1038
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,620
In that case, I think you'd be safe at a maid dream inn or at home.

1039
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:14,700
Because usually they have some maids that speak English and also their menus are in English too.

1040
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,920
What Shiro just said is kind of insane.

1041
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,600
While vacationing overseas, the owner's girlfriend got separated from him and went missing.

1042
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,580
Excuse me?

1043
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,580
So he just upped and left everything to go look for her.

1044
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,960
Last time we talked he was on some remote island in the southern hemisphere.

1045
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,280
Excuse me?

1046
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:49,650
Honoka?

1047
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,190
Who's Honoka?

1048
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:55,090
No spoilers of seiyuu until we get there.

1049
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:56,570
Or characters please.

1050
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:14,130
Before he left he told me that if I could find a new manager to fill in for him then I could keep the cafe running.

1051
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:22,370
But unfortunately we've never been able to find anyone.

1052
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,510
But we're going to make this place huge.

1053
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:28,650
We're going to make this place way better than the other maid cafe.

1054
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:33,010
All those otaku are going to be coming here and being like this is the authentic.

1055
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,530
The other place is too corporate.

1056
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,850
This place is now so homey and so lovely.

1057
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,330
And our maids are perfect and so cute.

1058
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,430
And filled with moe moe magic.

1059
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,070
Are there any other maids?

1060
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,390
Okay, maybe we're in trouble.

1061
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:08,640
So we have no owner, no maids, no fans.

1062
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,100
I think we're in trouble.

1063
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,220
After the owner left all the other girls quit.

1064
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,240
Thank you.

1065
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,340
On Sunday I went to my first idol live for my birthday.

1066
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,740
It was a kaigai idol seitansai.

1067
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:35,540
I wanted to thank you for inspiring me to try new things and showing me this amazing...

1068
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,840
What the world.

1069
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,320
Wow, Gliss, I hope you had so much fun.

1070
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,440
Kaigai idol seitansai.

1071
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,520
Like where you live or in Japan.

1072
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,680
The owner ran the cafe as a kind of a passion project.

1073
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,860
So it has never really turned to profit.

1074
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,200
Usually he would find money from somewhere else to cover the costs.

1075
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,900
But that was back when we still had other girls working here.

1076
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,440
Find money?

1077
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,000
Once he left we couldn't make enough to support the cafe.

1078
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,020
What's up?

1079
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,680
Wookie!

1080
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,900
Thanks for 7 bucks!

1081
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,520
Sorry for interrupting.

1082
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,240
But what is a good way to speedrun learning Japanese?

1083
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,280
Please help me.

1084
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,440
Thank you very much.

1085
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,380
Hello.

1086
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,520
What's up, Minto?

1087
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,640
Don't mind for interrupting the stream today.

1088
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,620
Good way to speedrun Nihongo.

1089
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,420
Maybe...

1090
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,020
Become Nihonjin!

1091
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,860
You're welcome.

1092
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,720
So eventually everyone else just gave up and quit.

1093
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,620
Sad.

1094
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,980
Have you found someone else?

1095
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,960
Wait, she just said that.

1096
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,380
Sorry.

1097
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,980
I tried looking...

1098
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,560
I tried looking everywhere but I couldn't find anyone who would be willing to do it.

1099
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:32,980
Okay.

1100
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,360
It is us.

1101
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,520
It is I.

1102
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:40,600
Up for the impossible task of love-living this Mint Cafe.

1103
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,820
It's not easy to work in this cafe, and I don't have any money.

1104
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,320
I don't think there's anyone who would be willing to be the manager.

1105
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:10,640
Someone.

1106
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:17,680
Busuu?

1107
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,780
What are you calling him?

1108
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,060
Ugly?

1109
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,260
Don't call him Busuu.

1110
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,240
It's not an easy job, especially since the cafe doesn't make much money.

1111
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,780
I can't imagine why anyone would even want the job.

1112
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,400
Sometimes I even fantasize of finding someone who is so desperate they have nowhere else to go.

1113
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,200
Then I can get them to be the manager.

1114
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,980
I reek of desperation.

1115
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,600
I think we did everything so...

1116
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,460
Wanikani is good for kanji?

1117
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,000
Yeah, I like Wanikani.

1118
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,520
Are you leaving, master?

1119
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,160
Thank you for coming.

1120
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,460
I'm sorry for not being able to serve you today, so you don't have to pay anything.

1121
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,660
It's on the house.

1122
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,520
Take care and please come again.

1123
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,560
I want to be your manager.

1124
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,760
She's so sweet.

1125
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,920
It's been so long since we've gotten a customer.

1126
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,320
This must be a good sign.

1127
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,920
Sorry, I'm a freak.

1128
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,360
Maybe the new manager is right around the corner.

1129
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,180
Or right behind you.

1130
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,540
I think she's... I think she's asking me.

1131
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,480
Bye, there you go.

1132
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,280
Thanks for the gift.

1133
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,320
Master, would you be interested in...

1134
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:07,920
Never mind.

1135
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,100
Please don't worry about it.

1136
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,570
But I didn't even... I didn't even like...

1137
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:16,130
Look at me.

1138
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,230
I didn't finish my coffee.

1139
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,370
This makes me want coffee.

1140
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,050
Master!

1141
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:38,030
Would you be interested in becoming the new manager of the cafe?

1142
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,630
I can prepare delicious food and support the maids.

1143
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,650
If you study a little, you'll get used to it.

1144
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,610
It's tough, but it's a fun job.

1145
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:07,610
That's true.

1146
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:10,830
At the very least, that's what I think.

1147
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,830
I've been taking a break for almost a year now.

1148
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,270
I happened to run into you when I opened the cafe.

1149
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,850
I'm sure we're meant to be together.

1150
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,550
Somehow I met you here today.

1151
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,750
It must be because you're tied to this cafe by fate.

1152
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,270
I now pronounce you manager and maid.

1153
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,070
You may moe moe the food.

1154
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:59,850
It's okay if you don't want to.

1155
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,030
I was just asking.

1156
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:07,390
While I was talking to you, I thought this person would be suitable for the manager.

1157
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,670
It would be nice if you could be our manager.

1158
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,090
So I thought it would be nice if you could be the new manager.

1159
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:23,930
Just straight out no!

1160
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,850
Here, no, no, we're not gonna...

1161
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:28,170
Yeah,

1162
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,050
that's fair.

1163
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,070
But being our new manager comes with a lot of perks.

1164
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,270
Every day with cute girl.

1165
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:45,810
Like...

1166
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:52,390
You can have as many drinks as you want.

1167
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,170
You can decorate the cafe however you like it.

1168
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,210
She told the truth.

1169
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:06,670
You can work with a bunch of cute girls!

1170
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,410
Oh, but I'm the only one left.

1171
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,850
Shiro, you're the only one I need.

1172
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,210
Oh no, I'm not even cute.

1173
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:29,550
Oh no, I can't think of anything else.

1174
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,070
Oh no.

1175
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,230
You wouldn't really get anything out of it.

1176
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,290
There really isn't anything attractive about this cafe.

1177
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:52,610
But still...

1178
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,350
I really like this place!

1179
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,430
Why'd you do that?

1180
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,870
Anyway, have a safe trip home!

1181
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,230
And please come again!

1182
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,050
This is literally you.

1183
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:25,030
I'll clean up a bit and go home too.

1184
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:28,630
Why not?

1185
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,110
Cute maid is everything I want.

1186
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,650
Oh wait, I still need to change the bed sheets in the owner's apartment.

1187
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:40,110
Excuse me, does it...

1188
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:43,150
It comes with a room?

1189
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:46,570
What's the matter master?

1190
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,010
Do you need anything else?

1191
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:48,710
A room?

1192
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:54,450
When the owner worked until late at night, he stayed there.

1193
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:09,930
Come to think of it, the owner...

1194
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,670
He said it was okay for the new manager to use the room.

1195
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:20,330
He said whoever became the manager could use the apartment.

1196
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:30,590
Since we haven't found a manager yet, the apartment's been empty the whole time.

1197
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:31,990
Thank you for playing this.

1198
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,490
You're the reason I discovered and bought the game.

1199
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:34,690
Snow on Steam.

1200
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:35,970
No way!

1201
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,330
Happy to hear about it.

1202
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:40,950
Thanks for getting it!

1203
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,250
Please let me work here!

1204
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:50,930
You want to work here?

1205
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,110
You'll be the new manager?

1206
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,410
I mean you just talked about all the perks, right?

1207
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,490
This isn't a dream!

1208
01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:59,510
Wait, why am I dreaming?

1209
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,450
Oh my god, she just hopped.

1210
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:05,210
Yay!

1211
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:05,970
Hip hip!

1212
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:06,850
Hoopee!

1213
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:07,670
Yippee!

1214
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:09,770
She hopped.

1215
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:10,550
So cute.

1216
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,970
Then I'll call you manager from now on!

1217
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,990
I look forward to working with you, Mr. Manager!

1218
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,590
And I'll show you to your room.

1219
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,670
The apartment is right above the cafe.

1220
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,430
Just take the stairs at the back.

1221
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,090
Obtained old notebook.

1222
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,930
Oh my gosh.

1223
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,650
Wait, Tuna, this one looks like your profile picture.

1224
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:01,010
The owner has Tuna on his wall.

1225
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:05,970
You say Gunpla?

1226
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:07,010
Oh my god, there is Gunpla!

1227
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:11,110
The guy has...I want this poster, whatever this one is.

1228
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:11,690
It's crazy.

1229
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,990
Mito CEO.

1230
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:16,490
Mito.

1231
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,590
It's literally Mito.

1232
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,320
The idol is from Colombia.

1233
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,340
She is heavily inspired by J-Idols.

1234
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,080
There are also small local groups too.

1235
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,140
I posted check-ins on Twitter.

1236
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:37,940
Wow!

1237
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,040
That's so awesome!

1238
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,500
Tuna's room dogs.

1239
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,500
Isn't that so awesome?

1240
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,780
This will be your place to stay from now on.

1241
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,900
Wandering Zero, thanks for two months!

1242
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,280
It hasn't been used in a pretty long time, but I come here regularly to keep it nice and clean.

1243
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,900
I love the gravure posters.

1244
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,980
It looks like my room.

1245
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,040
I feel nice at home here.

1246
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,680
So you can sleep here tonight if you want.

1247
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,680
By the way, we should probably go over the cafe situation so you understand what you are getting into.

1248
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,880
There is a shortage of staff, funds, and customers.

1249
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,420
You have gravure photos hanged?

1250
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:29,960
Yeah.

1251
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,560
You don't?

1252
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,100
I have nudie...

1253
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,520
Nudie wasp girls too.

1254
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,840
Why do you think I don't have anybody come over?

1255
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,400
Well, I took them down for Matara's visit.

1256
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,680
But for like gravure stuff, it's like...

1257
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,400
A lot of... well, not a lot, but like...

1258
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,620
There's like sometimes posters from idols and stuff.

1259
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,780
Like gravure posters.

1260
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,560
You lack conviction?

1261
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:11,180
I don't need to give her any more ammo on me, okay?

1262
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,260
We have three main problems.

1263
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,020
Lack of employees, lack of money, and lack of customers.

1264
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,900
Well, one of those will solve the other.

1265
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:26,080
The lack of customers will solve... or solving lack of customers will solve lack of money, right?

1266
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:29,580
About the lack of employees.

1267
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,280
As you already know, I'm the only person left working in the cafe.

1268
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,840
But the cafe needs at least two maids to actually operate.

1269
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,200
Maid turquoise.

1270
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,060
So our top priority is to find someone who will be our second maid.

1271
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,160
Look at her cry.

1272
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:11,280
I've already tried putting up posters for it and everything, but no one's ever shown up for the position.

1273
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,460
Let's poach someone from Miracle Maid Cafe.

1274
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,920
Let's poach them.

1275
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,500
That's kind of scary.

1276
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:26,880
Dang.

1277
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,400
Sorry, Miracle Maid Cafe.

1278
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,740
Poach them.

1279
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,260
Unbiased family thinks for six months.

1280
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,920
Yeah, we have fault in them.

1281
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,100
We have fault in them.

1282
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,440
Steal them.

1283
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,260
Now that you're here, it'll be fine.

1284
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:47,980
Yes!

1285
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,220
Lack of money.

1286
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,900
Sorry, I can't stop yawning.

1287
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,380
I thought of coffee and now I just want coffee.

1288
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,660
The cafe isn't making enough money to cover its expenses.

1289
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,720
Oh no!

1290
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,620
The owner left some money for rent, but that's about to run out soon.

1291
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:18,460
Tate!

1292
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:18,980
Tate?

1293
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:19,760
Tate?

1294
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,480
Welcome to Mambo Show!

1295
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,100
Thank you!

1296
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:34,340
If the cafe stays closed any longer, we might not be able to pay the next rent.

1297
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:34,900
Oh no!

1298
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,420
Wait, does that include the upstairs apartment?

1299
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,960
So we have no time to lose!

1300
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,720
The owner used it personally, but I borrowed it as part of the cafe.

1301
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,280
Oh my god, we can't go homeless again.

1302
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,760
Even though the apartment was just for the owner's personal use, it's rented as part of the cafe itself.

1303
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:04,840
If we can't pay the rent, we'll have to return this room as well.

1304
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,460
Now that the Big Shell has its own maid cafe, we're gonna need some maids.

1305
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,320
Mother Base.

1306
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,400
That's why it's called Mother Base.

1307
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,600
Because...

1308
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,000
Oh wait.

1309
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,100
You welcome your mom home!

1310
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,200
Or they are your mom.

1311
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:27,620
Wait.

1312
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,820
We're workshopping it.

1313
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,420
We're workshopping it!

1314
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:54,170
Because your mom is at home, and then the maids welcome you home.

1315
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:57,330
Get it?

1316
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,370
We have one maid.

1317
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:02,070
It's Paz.

1318
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:03,450
Not my cat.

1319
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:17,370
Whatever.

1320
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,290
You guys don't understand my genius.

1321
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:23,250
If we can't pay rent, the apartment would have to go along with the cafe.

1322
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,110
Oh gosh.

1323
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:32,070
Sorry.

1324
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:35,710
It must be fate that you showed up and became the new manager at this exact moment.

1325
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,750
About the lack of customers.

1326
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,870
I don't get it, but I adore your enthusiasm.

1327
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,970
Paz.

1328
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:54,130
Ozzy!

1329
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,790
Take your foreburns!

1330
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,890
The most popular maid cafe at Electric Street is Miracle Maid Cafe.

1331
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,650
Everyone goes there.

1332
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:13,130
And we can't hold a candle to them, either in location or popularity.

1333
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:18,550
What can we do to attract more customers?

1334
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:30,050
You can have a collaboration with the one and only Maid Mint Phantom of Maid Mint Phantom Channel.

1335
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,860
Direct hit.

1336
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,660
We can organize an event.

1337
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:51,880
A collaboration.

1338
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:58,400
I hear you want to get into UpDog.

1339
01:15:59,080 --> 01:15:59,840
I'm impressed.

1340
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:10,200
What's UpDog?

1341
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,860
I'll leave that sort of thing to you, manager.

1342
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,560
UpDog is getting kicked out of our apartment.

1343
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,860
Losing our job.

1344
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:54,080
Our top priority is to find a girl who is willing to work here as a maid.

1345
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,080
Let's reopen the cafe as soon as possible.

1346
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,540
We should start looking tomorrow.

1347
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,540
Or right now.

1348
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,000
Could we exchange numbers so we can contact each other?

1349
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:21,000
I obtained Shiro's phone number.

1350
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,960
It's getting late.

1351
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,840
I should go home.

1352
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,620
Good night, manager.

1353
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,560
Sweet dreams.

1354
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,420
Nice.

1355
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,880
This is our room now, huh?

1356
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,960
I don't understand what this light is for.

1357
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,000
Oh my gosh, the view!

1358
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,520
What is...I can't read.

1359
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:56,420
I can't read.

1360
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,360
What is the tower called in Osaka?

1361
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:03,840
Do I flip?

1362
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,380
No!

1363
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:05,840
Not yet.

1364
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,160
Unless we can't save the cafe.

1365
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,600
Thank you!

1366
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,500
I could only read the ten.

1367
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,620
I learned a lot.

1368
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:23,140
What is this?

1369
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,280
Oh my gosh!

1370
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:28,860
The hat!

1371
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,480
I thought it was the shadow of a person looking out of the bookshelf.

1372
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,500
I was like, suddenly it turned into a horror game.

1373
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,940
Oh my gosh, it scared me.

1374
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:46,980
Use?

1375
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:47,480
Ah!

1376
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:48,840
Use!

1377
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,600
Use.

1378
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,140
The computer.

1379
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,260
There is something that keeps popping up and I keep missing it.

1380
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:05,740
This?

1381
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,040
OK, nevermind.

1382
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,480
It's a simple tidy bed.

1383
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,320
I'll just have to hold out until my belongings arrive.

1384
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,820
OK, turn that off.

1385
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,940
Can we observe what's on the wall?

1386
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,540
We got our own little bathroom.

1387
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,500
This is actually not bad.

1388
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,480
This is not bad at all.

1389
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,600
Let's go to sleep.

1390
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,060
Ready to go to bed?

1391
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:34,560
Yes.

1392
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,560
Today was a really long day.

1393
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,400
I should go to bed.

1394
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,840
I wouldn't be able to sleep, I think.

1395
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:41,920
Today was a nice day.

1396
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:42,700
Good night.

1397
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,940
Why can I actually say Mint in this game?

1398
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,560
As like a secret side mission character?

1399
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:56,840
This is so cute, the music.

1400
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,840
Actually, there is something with this game.

1401
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,280
Hold on.

1402
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:03,340
There is an adventurer's tavern in the game.

1403
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:07,520
I saw them post about this earlier on Twitter.

1404
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:20,180
The first 15 players who find the adventurer's tavern and then DM a screenshot to the Twitter account...

1405
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:30,480
I don't know if it's the Playism Twitter account or the Mint Cafe on Electric Street Twitter account.

1406
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:38,800
But the first 15 people who tweet it to the account gets their name in the game.

1407
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:40,860
Isn't that so cool?

1408
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,740
Don't reveal to chat.

1409
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,460
No, it's okay.

1410
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,500
I want people to have their name in the game.

1411
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:55,510
You could say... You could put your name and then say, thanks to Mint Phantom.

1412
01:20:55,510 --> 01:21:03,430
Or if I find it, then I'll put my name.

1413
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:07,730
But they only just posted about it today.

1414
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:12,990
They only just posted about it today.

1415
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:16,190
Maybe 15 people haven't found it yet.

1416
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,270
Is this a horror game?

1417
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,170
No, it's a cozy game.

1418
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,730
Don't worry.

1419
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,470
Good morning!

1420
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:26,310
Sorry.

1421
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:28,290
I

1422
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:36,380
haven't been able to talk to anyone on the phone in ages, so...

1423
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,920
I'm just a little nervous.

1424
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,340
I'm getting on the train soon.

1425
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,600
I'll be there in 2 or 3 stations, so...

1426
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:01,850
Let's meet up at the station on the east side of Electric Street.

1427
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,500
Okay, see you there.

1428
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,380
Alright, go to the train station.

1429
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,420
Goodbye home?

1430
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:15,860
We didn't shower or anything.

1431
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,380
We're kind of disgusting.

1432
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:22,300
Wow!

1433
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,080
Good morning, Electric Street!

1434
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,560
Good morning!

1435
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,420
Or change, yeah.

1436
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,380
We're kind of awful.

1437
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,080
A friend of mine lives around this area in Osaka.

1438
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,860
He showed me this game to him and he says the game made a fairly accurate Nipponbashi.

1439
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,300
Really?

1440
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,540
That's so fun!

1441
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,320
Probably could recognize...

1442
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:46,180
Cute.

1443
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:47,600
Cute.

1444
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,920
The girl sitting on the ground lifts her head a little to look at you.

1445
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,180
She's my type!

1446
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,000
Oh my god, she's so cute.

1447
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:09,500
Drills.

1448
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,320
The girl doesn't respond and only keeps staring at you.

1449
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:14,980
Keep apologizing.

1450
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,860
The girl doesn't respond and only keeps staring at you.

1451
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,320
Lend a hand.

1452
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,220
The girl hesitates but eventually takes her hand and stands up.

1453
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,420
Look at her hair!

1454
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,300
Observe the girl.

1455
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:37,040
The girl is rather petite and she's wearing a dark lolita dress with lace frills.

1456
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:44,040
She has light blue meticulously curled hair and her eyes that burn a bright red.

1457
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,680
Every feature is as striking as the last.

1458
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:53,320
Her face is as beautiful as a painted porcelain doll, yet her expression feels somewhat cool and mysterious.

1459
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,460
She looks like she belongs on the cover of a light novel.

1460
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,680
I guess I'll go.

1461
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,020
There's no mistaking it.

1462
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,480
The girl suddenly speaks.

1463
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,900
Fate knows the life of every speck of dust in the universe.

1464
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,960
I have foreseen your future.

1465
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,480
You will soon be struck by a terrible catastrophe.

1466
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:41,320
Once the gears of fate have started to turn, not even the gods can do anything to stop them.

1467
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,340
You stare at the girl with confusion written clearly on your face.

1468
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,180
Huh?

1469
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:47,760
Really?

1470
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,100
Oh, she's my type!

1471
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,420
Oh, she's weird!

1472
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:00,680
Ah, she's a freak!

1473
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:10,020
I am the slayer of the false god, the queen of the kingdom of darkness, the all-seeing oracle, the guardian of all dreams!

1474
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:10,720
Fafna.

1475
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,120
Fate.

1476
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,120
Fate brought us before each other.

1477
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:32,180
Now, do as I say, so that you may be saved.

1478
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:41,140
But of course, salvation comes with a price.

1479
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,080
She's so cute.

1480
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,180
She's cute.

1481
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,940
From now on, she'll be known as Lulu.

1482
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,320
No!

1483
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,720
She's a Fafna!

1484
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,400
If it's money you want, then forget it.

1485
01:25:59,280 --> 01:25:59,860
Fang!

1486
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,960
She's perfect.

1487
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
I won't charge you for anything, promise!

1488
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,420
But if you don't listen to me, you'll be cursed with bad luck.

1489
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,570
You'll encounter ceaseless maladies and misfortunes.

1490
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,360
I mean...

1491
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:33,420
You'll be really unlucky and you'll definitely regret it.

1492
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,340
Fafna, huh?

1493
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,480
Sounds familiar.

1494
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,500
To what?

1495
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,680
Oh, we're becoming her familiar?

1496
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:46,240
You won't make a good familiar at this rate.

1497
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,640
The girl's expression turns into one of panic.

1498
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,620
Her cool and mysterious demeanor is shattered in an instant.

1499
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:56,120
A familiar?

1500
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,480
Don't worry about that right now.

1501
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,660
Oh my gosh, we're gonna become a familiar.

1502
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,760
She seems to be trying to appear dignified again.

1503
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,900
I believe in you.

1504
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,900
Someday, you will repay my debt.

1505
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,920
Why can't encounters like this happen to me?

1506
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,160
Why is afterlife so cruel?

1507
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,320
Why can't this hap...

1508
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:30,960
Is everything okay?

1509
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,680
Sorry, my OBS just disconnected for some reason.

1510
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,040
The encounter!

1511
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,480
The encounter!

1512
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:45,080
The encounter!

1513
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,280
We're back, we're good.

1514
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,060
Sorry about that.

1515
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,000
Sorry, my OBS got a little funky.

1516
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,820
I believe that you will repay me in something that is worth far more than money.

1517
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:57,460
Job experience.

1518
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,620
She puts a hand in her pocket.

1519
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:09,500
Now, accept my blessing.

1520
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,320
This will bestow upon you the power to slay the false god.

1521
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,920
A 401k.

1522
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,940
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

1523
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,320
Who is her seiyuu?

1524
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,460
It's gone?

1525
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,220
But I still had it when I left the bookstore.

1526
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,840
Where did it go?

1527
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,760
Press confirm to investigate your surroundings.

1528
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,660
The thing right here?

1529
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:40,820
Literally the thing right here?

1530
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,460
Oh wait, this thing right here.

1531
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,580
Paid in exposure.

1532
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,080
Nijika from Bocchi?

1533
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,640
Ah, Sayamizu Shiro.

1534
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,340
Wow, stacked?

1535
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:56,980
What is this?

1536
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,480
You found a broom leaning on the wall of the bookstore.

1537
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,360
You spot something in the corner.

1538
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,220
Try to take it.

1539
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,160
You reach with your hand, but it's out of range.

1540
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:09,880
You might need a tool.

1541
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,380
Leave it.

1542
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,500
I will grab the broom.

1543
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,700
Ask if you can borrow it.

1544
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,840
You ask someone in the bookstore to lend you the broom.

1545
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:19,680
They said yes.

1546
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:20,820
Obtained broom.

1547
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,440
Investigate.

1548
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,640
Try to get it out with the broom.

1549
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,380
We got the mysterious silver pendant.

1550
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,740
Hey, were you looking for this?

1551
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,640
But when you look around, the strange girl is nowhere to be seen.

1552
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,060
Nothing new.

1553
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,960
You return the broom and put the pendant in your pocket.

1554
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,380
Information about Fafnir.

1555
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,680
Where'd she go?

1556
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,300
My queen!

1557
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:50,920
I am your familiar!

1558
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:51,100
I

1559
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:08,560
can't tell what this last one, this one on the far right is referencing.

1560
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:11,780
Oh my god, pop fiction.

1561
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,200
Like this poster.

1562
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,160
I can't tell what it's referencing.

1563
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:28,900
H-Max?

1564
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,320
No, no, the one on the bottom.

1565
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:31,480
There we go.

1566
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:36,120
The one the character is standing next to.

1567
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:42,750
Realize there's a Madoka look-a-like poster.

1568
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:43,650
There is, right?

1569
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,570
Yeah, it's cute.

1570
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:45,710
It's Muguka.

1571
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:47,470
Mugumagi.

1572
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:48,890
Conan?

1573
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,530
Go dance with this.

1574
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:56,450
What do you mean with the nugget?

1575
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:59,650
A girl who left her time?

1576
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,070
No.

1577
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,050
There is one, yeah.

1578
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:02,770
That one.

1579
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:05,770
The one that just appeared is the girl who left her time, but...

1580
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,310
I can't tell.

1581
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:09,930
Conan.

1582
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,810
I don't think it's Conan.

1583
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:14,590
Why are you dancing in front of the...

1584
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:15,690
Wodonalds?

1585
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:19,670
Why are you dancing in front of the Wodonalds?

1586
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:20,930
This is how you sound!

1587
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,830
The BGM makes me think of Nyangostar.

1588
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:30,590
The JP Metal Drummer mascot from that one video where he goes way too hard on the cue music.

1589
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:32,110
I don't know that one.

1590
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:34,770
I don't know that one.

1591
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:37,570
It kind of looks like Conan.

1592
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:39,330
I don't know.

1593
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:40,650
It's going to drive me crazy.

1594
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:48,250
Oh my god!

1595
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:50,010
Hitting Mike Tyson's ass.

1596
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:52,670
Welcome to Mambo Ship.

1597
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,550
Happy New Year!

1598
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:00,170
She's in casual clothes.

1599
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:02,190
I thought she would be in a maid outfit.

1600
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:07,190
When you arrive at the station, a girl with black hair catches your attention.

1601
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:18,470
You notice that she has headphones on.

1602
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:20,830
She looks around at the crowd as if looking for someone.

1603
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:22,050
It's Chido.

1604
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:24,370
She looks a little different outside of her maid dress.

1605
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,230
She doesn't seem to notice you there.

1606
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,450
Watch her.

1607
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:35,330
She seems to be enjoying her music.

1608
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:38,930
She bounces to the rhythm and even strikes a cute pose.

1609
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:46,310
But perhaps hit by a sudden wave of embarrassment, she quickly stops and pretends nothing ever happened.

1610
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:52,310
But this has happened to me before, especially when listening to Seikan Hiko from Macross.

1611
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,530
Like my hand instinctively does the Kira.

1612
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:59,190
So I understand.

1613
01:32:59,190 --> 01:33:02,470
My hand goes Kira.

1614
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:06,150
I'm watching her.

1615
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:08,310
I'm looking at her clothes.

1616
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:09,210
She's wearing mint?

1617
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,160
Greet her.

1618
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,940
She's wearing mint clothing.

1619
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:27,100
When did you arrive?

1620
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,100
After 12 months I'm finally a licensed...

1621
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:40,600
Lily, please!

1622
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:41,600
You're a jerk in it!

1623
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,760
You're a jerk in it!

1624
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,020
Where

1625
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:52,390
did you go in here?

1626
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:02,010
I'm glad you seem to be doing better today.

1627
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:04,830
This lady looks like she's going through it.

1628
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,550
Let's do our best.

1629
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:12,390
Let's find ourselves a new maid.

1630
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,410
That's a cute outfit.

1631
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,210
No it's not!

1632
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,510
I wear this all the time!

1633
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:35,590
I was a little worried he wouldn't recognize me since I'm not in my maid dress.

1634
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,430
It's not that cute.

1635
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,490
We've only met twice so far.

1636
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,210
You keep trying to flatter me.

1637
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:54,830
It's not very nice manager.

1638
01:34:55,650 --> 01:35:00,490
Come to think of it, I also asked the manager for a job when we first met.

1639
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:07,370
I'm confused that her sprite has pink but her dress is actually white.

1640
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,510
I guess I did ask a total stranger to become the manager of a cafe, huh?

1641
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,250
That's probably not very nice either.

1642
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,490
Yeah, it's probably also not very wise.

1643
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:19,550
Any freak can become the manager.

1644
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,050
Like me.

1645
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:27,930
I'm the freak.

1646
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:34,650
Yeah, I'm fine.

1647
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:35,330
Sorry.

1648
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:36,470
I'm good.

1649
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:40,170
We've got to find someone who will work alongside us today.

1650
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:47,110
That way we'll be able to reopen the cafe.

1651
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:48,710
So let's give it our best shot.

1652
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:50,430
What should I say?

1653
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:54,890
I'm looking forward to our date today.

1654
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:04,590
This is actually technically a sign.

1655
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,890
Don't tease me like that manager.

1656
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:12,770
What should I say?

1657
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,010
Let's say how do we find a maid.

1658
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:20,450
Okay, we'll start by walking around town.

1659
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,430
There's a lot of different shops at Electric Street.

1660
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:35,830
We might run into a new maid candidate if we're lucky.

1661
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:36,750
Probably.

1662
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:38,590
If we're very lucky.

1663
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:47,110
No, I worked here.

1664
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:49,690
You don't know this place very well yet, do you?

1665
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:50,590
I'll show you around.

1666
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:54,010
Let's just... I think we're good about the other stuff.

1667
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:55,410
Actually, why Electric Street?

1668
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:56,030
I'm curious.

1669
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:08,350
This is just what I've noticed personally, but I feel there are more girls here that might be interested in maid cafes.

1670
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:12,950
Hmm...

1671
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:14,590
You spend 19 hours a day in an office?

1672
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:15,570
How would you know the area?

1673
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:17,070
Okay, true.

1674
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:19,370
Okay, that's very fair.

1675
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:20,090
Never mind.

1676
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,470
We had to eat sometime, right?

1677
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:28,590
If you go anywhere else and ask random girls on the street, do you want to become a maid or something like that?

1678
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:32,750
They might think you're suspicious and call the police.

1679
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:36,750
They think you're suspicious or worse, they might...

1680
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,270
Call the police!

1681
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:44,550
Okay, I think we know enough about becoming a maid.

1682
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:45,570
Let's go.

1683
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:48,510
I'll be right behind you.

1684
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:51,270
Okay, do you want to become a maid?

1685
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:53,590
Welcome to the Electric Street Station.

1686
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:58,770
You can use an IC card to travel around Osaka, but I would also recommend the one-day pass.

1687
01:38:01,210 --> 01:38:02,690
She's right behind me.

1688
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:09,930
Okie dokie, cop maid.

1689
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,420
She's right behind me, isn't she?

1690
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,400
Minto, a girl behind you.

1691
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:31,320
Mama.

1692
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,640
Let's start looking for a new maid.

1693
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,260
We have to keep our eyes peeled for cute girls.

1694
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:46,160
Whether anyone cute comes by is all down to luck, so let's take it easy.

1695
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:46,980
That's right!

1696
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,320
Manager-san, is there anywhere you'd like to go?

1697
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,020
Let's take a look around the electric district.

1698
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:02,860
Where?

1699
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:12,990
Zatsudan button?

1700
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:19,690
If you want to talk to me about something, just press the... I almost said it, the chat button.

1701
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:22,450
Oh my gosh, the Zatsudan button, everybody.

1702
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:27,050
Continue your search on Electric Street, you can talk to Shiro with the chat button.

1703
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:28,930
V.

1704
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,350
Anywhere you want to go?

1705
01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:36,310
Oh, that's all she says.

1706
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:40,230
This girl is kind of cute.

1707
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:45,270
Cute girl.

1708
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,690
As much as I run, I can't get below it.

1709
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,870
Maybe in the arcade there's some cute girls.

1710
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,590
Manager, please come over here quick.

1711
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:04,430
Let's go to the second floor.

1712
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:06,330
What's on the second floor?

1713
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,660
There's something I want to show you.

1714
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:16,520
Did that say Adventurer's Tavern?

1715
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:17,960
Where?

1716
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:20,760
No!

1717
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,160
Wait, Adventurer's Tavern!

1718
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,020
It did?

1719
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,780
Is this where all the Otoge is?

1720
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:31,860
Oh no.

1721
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,100
Magic Angel Lilith of the Moon and the Idols of the Twelve Stars.

1722
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,820
Just Magic Angel is fine though.

1723
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,640
Where's the Wakka tab?

1724
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,300
I'm really sorry to tell you, but...

1725
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,480
You might want to find a new game.

1726
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:11,420
Magic Angel isn't the most popular game out there just yet, but thanks to the comics, light novels, and offline live concerts, it's definitely going to be the next big thing.

1727
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,740
The anime starts next year too!

1728
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:21,020
At first glance, the setting of the idols seems to be very common, but that's not the case!

1729
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,060
This is a new style!

1730
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:28,340
Wait, Shiro, I love you, but I need to go be one of the first 15 people!

1731
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:40,180
The magical girl and idol themes probably sound really overdone, but it's super well made and has so much love and effort put into it, so I know it's going to set a new standard for other media like it.

1732
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,660
I want to be in the game!

1733
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:56,320
People only hate things that are cliché or overdone when they're badly made, but Magic Angel is so high quality it's leagues above the other franchises.

1734
01:41:56,820 --> 01:42:00,680
Not to mention, the first thing it has are tried and true tropes!

1735
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:27,580
So I personally think this is way better than adding weird tropes to tried and tested formulas just to appear different and shocking.

1736
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:29,940
These people have no love for genres they're creating for!

1737
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:31,180
That's right.

1738
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,440
Love is the most important thing.

1739
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:37,460
And when you play Metal Gear...

1740
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:41,000
Love is the one thing that makes people move.

1741
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,880
Ah, I'm sorry!

1742
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:08,320
I got carried away there.

1743
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:10,860
Let's get back to the topic.

1744
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:21,040
This arcade game, Magic Angel, is the origin of all the series.

1745
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:24,060
It's a game where you use real trading cards to play.

1746
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:27,260
The player receives the support of Lilith, the little devil of the moon.

1747
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,180
What a nerd.

1748
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,840
It's a trading card game where you use real physical cards.

1749
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:44,080
The player supports the cute moon devil Lilith, who produces 12 idols and assigns them to fight alien monsters.

1750
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:50,800
She's so cute.

1751
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,680
Aren't the idols lying down in the room in the main menu so cute?

1752
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:09,660
When the mission is successful, the idols who defeated the alien monsters sing and dance live.

1753
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,860
With the income from the live, they strengthen their idols and equipments and fight again.

1754
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,780
So true!

1755
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:29,700
Once they beat an alien monster and clear the mission, the idols who fought hold a live concert.

1756
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:34,280
And then you use the money earned from the concert to upgrade your idols and gear before going on the next mission.

1757
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,680
There's this cheeky character...

1758
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,000
There's this cheeky character called Lililana.

1759
01:44:51,820 --> 01:44:53,240
And she's super cute.

1760
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,100
I grinded so much for her banner.

1761
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,900
And when I finally got her, I spent so much time poking her for interactions.

1762
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,840
I forgot to play the actual game.

1763
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:11,120
So if I ever get the chance... Wait, if you ever get the chance, you will have to try it.

1764
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,580
However, if I don't find a maid today, I won't be able to enter the world of magic.

1765
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,140
You're already in the game, bitch.

1766
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,000
But our

1767
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,480
mission today is to find a new maid for the cafe.

1768
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:32,440
We don't have time to get lost in the world of magic and music.

1769
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:38,540
Hold on, we'll come back.

1770
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:44,640
Oh, I think we have to... Maybe we go upstairs.

1771
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,120
How do we get in there?

1772
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,360
Wait, hold on.

1773
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:49,780
Let me see what the thing says on here.

1774
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,620
Who find adventurer's tavern and tell us how they got there.

1775
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:57,760
How do we get in there?

1776
01:45:58,780 --> 01:45:59,580
Second floor.

1777
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:15,960
Sounds like it might be a secret entrance.

1778
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:16,880
I think so too.

1779
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,000
Hmm...

1780
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,780
This is the most popular photo booth machine right now.

1781
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,180
The photos are really high-res and there's a bunch of cute frames and filters to choose from.

1782
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:49,100
There's a loading thing that said it's open at night.

1783
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,880
It's really easy to make anyone take...

1784
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,980
Wait, it makes it really easy for anyone to take cute photos.

1785
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:06,780
J-MAX, look at the membership.

1786
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:10,460
Puri.

1787
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:11,140
Puri.

1788
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,020
Puri.

1789
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:12,900
Puri.

1790
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:14,500
Puri.

1791
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,190
Puriki.

1792
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:39,470
Puri.

1793
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:40,470
Puri.

1794
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:40,870
Puri.

1795
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:42,030
Puri.

1796
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:44,050
Puri.

1797
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:48,470
Can't believe photo booths survived the 80s.

1798
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:52,030
Wait, if you don't know the Purikura though, it's like so...

1799
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,830
popular.

1800
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:56,130
In Japan, Purikura.

1801
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:57,870
Is what I know.

1802
01:47:58,310 --> 01:47:59,770
Never heard of it called the Puriki.

1803
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:04,110
It's like...

1804
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,270
It's like...

1805
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:07,030
But they make your eyes really...

1806
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:08,310
buggy.

1807
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,030
They make your eyes like...

1808
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:12,870
like an alien.

1809
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:17,430
And then they kind of like...

1810
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:19,290
do a beauty filter on your face.

1811
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:22,770
And I actually have one that I took with Emiri.

1812
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,170
Emiri and I got...

1813
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:27,110
We got our hair done in Japan together.

1814
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:28,530
My friend Emiri.

1815
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,270
And we did Purikura together.

1816
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:33,750
And I have our Purikura...

1817
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,370
on my...

1818
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:37,050
on like a little board above my computer.

1819
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:44,850
It's cute.

1820
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:47,630
Except...

1821
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:50,610
We look like aliens.

1822
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:56,090
Let's take a photo together.

1823
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,540
It's kind of embarrassing.

1824
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,620
Maybe next time.

1825
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:11,240
I never know when to stop, when to start.

1826
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:14,920
Promise.

1827
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:20,700
Let's come back to take a photo once we successfully reopen the cafe.

1828
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,620
It's a promise.

1829
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:26,040
Wait, what did they say upstairs?

1830
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:28,360
I guess we have to wait then for night time.

1831
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,400
I want to try the game.

1832
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,360
Why are there so many bathrooms here?

1833
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:35,760
I want to play Magic Angel.

1834
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,440
Our enemy.

1835
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,320
Our enemy.

1836
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,720
How do we get to Adventurer's Tavern?

1837
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:01,420
It says Purikura, second floor.

1838
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,820
Arcade, third floor.

1839
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:08,860
There must be a secret to get to the Adventurer's Tavern.

1840
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,580
We'll wait for it to be night time, I suppose.

1841
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:16,560
Surugaia!

1842
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,360
Look at her!

1843
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:29,860
From Magic Angel?

1844
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:30,780
She's so cute.

1845
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,920
I needed this.

1846
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,760
This Aqua also looks really nice.

1847
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,920
Might as well get the whole team while I'm here.

1848
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:45,980
Where are the other badges?

1849
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:50,300
There you are.

1850
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:50,720
Yay!

1851
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:54,880
OK, that's all for today.

1852
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,220
Oh...

1853
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:20,160
The 5th anniversary merch is the little order... wait, sorry.

1854
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,420
Is the order a little sister?

1855
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:22,600
Yes, please!

1856
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,300
Gochu?

1857
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,080
Gochu?

1858
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:28,280
Gochi?

1859
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:29,080
Gochu?

1860
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:30,460
Wait, it's Gochiusa.

1861
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,880
Gochiusa is the...

1862
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:36,060
short version.

1863
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,440
Is the order a potato?

1864
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,080
I was thinking that too.

1865
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,480
Tomorrow is Chino's birthday?

1866
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,240
No way!

1867
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:50,140
I think right now at Atre in Akihabara...

1868
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,140
Maybe not right now.

1869
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,340
Or maybe...

1870
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,800
Recently it was a Gochiusa.

1871
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:04,760
I love how it's like a combination of probably Gochiusa and then Oreimo, right?

1872
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:12,920
Oops!

1873
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,500
Now that's all for today.

1874
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:23,380
Please wait here, Miniature.

1875
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,780
I'll go pay for all my new merch.

1876
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,140
OK, I'm not gonna judge her.

1877
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:36,280
You guys, we need to super chat Chino!

1878
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:44,340
Considering making 50 different alts to post on the tweet just to make sure Minto couldn't get in his revenge...

1879
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,880
for not getting a puppet.

1880
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,360
What are you talking about, Kinky?

1881
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,100
The puppets are still open!

1882
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:51,160
You can still get one!

1883
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:57,620
They're on pre-order for the second badge!

1884
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:05,200
Also, it's only 15, not 50.

1885
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,240
You would've wasted your time making 50 accounts, super chatting Chino.

1886
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:21,390
Second badge just woke on it.

1887
01:53:23,230 --> 01:53:25,270
Pass the Supazon please, boss.

1888
01:53:25,330 --> 01:53:26,950
I will, because I am the boss.

1889
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,390
I will pay her handsomely.

1890
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,860
Enough for food next week.

1891
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:41,580
Really?

1892
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,680
Wait, what do you mean really, Vivicore?

1893
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:46,700
Because if you mean about the plushies, yes.

1894
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,240
Yes, really.

1895
01:53:49,060 --> 01:53:50,600
People have been buying them still.

1896
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:52,360
I've been watching the number go up.

1897
01:53:56,140 --> 01:54:00,760
I've actually been avoiding Tsurugaya lately because I wanted to fight by spending urges, but...

1898
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,320
I didn't see what the choices were!

1899
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:08,520
Oh my gosh.

1900
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:09,940
What were the choices?

1901
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,340
Oopsie.

1902
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:17,640
I accidentally just picked something because I thought it was me going to... I didn't realize there were choices there.

1903
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:18,280
Oopsie.

1904
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:20,140
Chino, will you date me?

1905
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:25,680
Chino super contribution?

1906
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:26,760
Suddenly money.

1907
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:36,610
Actually, there's also some merch that I pre-ordered, so by the time that releases, my savings will...

1908
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:41,430
Maybe I should just give up?

1909
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,110
She don't need money.

1910
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:54,370
But look how happy she is.

1911
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:58,510
Food is temporary.

1912
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:06,130
You can become a ghost and still love your waifus.

1913
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:12,530
I thought about it, but as long as we find a new maid today, we can reopen the cafe tomorrow and I'll get paid!

1914
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:16,370
Super for Goshiro.

1915
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:18,810
So it's fine.

1916
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:21,330
All we have to do is find a maid by the end of the day.

1917
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:24,270
This is fun!

1918
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:26,790
I can feel a huge weight on my shoulders.

1919
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:29,890
Cute!

1920
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:31,950
There are lots of new arrivals.

1921
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:32,530
Please look around.

1922
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:33,270
What do you have to buy?

1923
01:55:34,230 --> 01:55:35,090
Oh my gosh!

1924
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:38,210
It's the order a little sister movie poster!

1925
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:42,050
Change tapestry.

1926
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:44,430
Change tapestry tool.

1927
01:55:47,410 --> 01:55:48,370
Booksia archive.

1928
01:55:48,370 --> 01:55:48,590
Archive?

1929
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:55,560
It's not based off a blue archive.

1930
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:56,940
Oh my goodness.

1931
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:02,160
In the game books... Maybe Wooshia archive?

1932
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,000
Wooshia?

1933
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:06,320
Wooshia.

1934
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:12,220
Animal Street!

1935
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:13,940
Animal Street.

1936
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:17,960
Denmon Amethyst.

1937
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,020
Nice.

1938
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,080
Oh!

1939
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:23,720
Oh my gosh!

1940
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,660
It's just Valhalla!

1941
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:32,130
Sorry, I was so focused on the archive part.

1942
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:34,350
I was like, oh haha, blue archive.

1943
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:41,740
La Mulana?

1944
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:47,260
What?

1945
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,100
Rose and Camellia.

1946
01:56:55,120 --> 01:56:56,040
I don't know this one.

1947
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,380
Wait, there are some actual things.

1948
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,280
Rose and Camellia.

1949
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:07,940
La Mulana.

1950
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,640
Aren't they re-releasing that?

1951
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:10,660
Soon?

1952
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,360
In like a...

1953
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:14,020
In like a thing?

1954
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:23,830
It's the Ojo-sama slapping game.

1955
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:27,910
Let's talk to her.

1956
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:31,530
This week's working schedule and super common event will conflict.

1957
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:33,150
Maybe I should change the shift.

1958
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:36,310
Okay.

1959
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:40,330
Nothing else around here?

1960
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:41,170
Okay, let's leave.

1961
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:46,230
What else we got?

1962
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:47,250
We got Famistop.

1963
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:50,610
We've got...

1964
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:53,670
He should be right here!

1965
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,640
He should be right there!

1966
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:07,020
It removes the... What is this?

1967
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,000
Snake erasure?

1968
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,780
Snake, where are you?

1969
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,420
Snake!

1970
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,600
Oh my gosh.

1971
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,280
Mazindam.

1972
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:38,700
They should have at least put like a guy that...

1973
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:40,460
Like Splinter Cell Man or something.

1974
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,700
Not even a box.

1975
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:47,660
Cute!

1976
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:51,460
She sits right next to me and we're like kind of blinking at each other.

1977
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,640
Snake is dead.

1978
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,480
Don't say that!

1979
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,140
You've created a time paradox.

1980
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,220
Let's see inside the Famistop.

1981
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07,380
It's quite nice in here.

1982
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:14,600
This Famistop, they have everything from snacks to daily necessities.

1983
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,600
I think it's funny that like... Can you imagine...

1984
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:24,580
Like, you know, being a Nihonjin and someone trying to explain to you what Family Mart is?

1985
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:34,000
Since it's the Electric Street Famistop, they might have special items you can't find anywhere else.

1986
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,060
Seasonal watermelon soda!

1987
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:42,200
I love limited items.

1988
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,280
I always get...

1989
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:46,440
I always get got by seasonal items.

1990
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:49,240
I'm just like...

1991
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:49,620
Limited?

1992
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:50,640
Buys.

1993
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:53,100
You

1994
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,540
get it.

1995
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:03,540
You watch Shiro run to the drinks fridge.

1996
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,420
Then comes back with her arms full of snacks.

1997
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,540
I keep buying too much.

1998
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:19,940
Let's share some of it together.

1999
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:23,300
I was trying to say tomorrow.

2000
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,120
Together.

2001
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:24,900
Yes, together.

2002
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:25,980
Oh, what can we buy here?

2003
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:27,520
Welcome.

2004
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:31,720
What are you looking for?

2005
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,340
We got Pocori.

2006
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:34,880
Anpan!

2007
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:37,340
I love Anpan.

2008
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:38,840
I love Anpan.

2009
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:46,460
Makeup set.

2010
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,540
Should be a good gift for girls.

2011
02:00:50,360 --> 02:00:51,860
Rakumi barley tea.

2012
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:52,380
Yummy!

2013
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:55,340
Exclusive.

2014
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:56,420
Nippon Bashi.

2015
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,680
Exclusive packaging.

2016
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:58,180
Wow.

2017
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:04,080
Deluxe golden fatty tuna flavor cat food.

2018
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,700
So we're gonna get the cats later too.

2019
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:07,160
Nice.

2020
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,200
What does this guy have to say?

2021
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,620
Once I'm done with cashier work, I have to clean.

2022
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:13,620
Then restock the shelves.

2023
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:16,480
I thought working here would be easy, but there is so much work to do.

2024
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,020
I'm part time worker.

2025
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:21,220
Fatty tuna.

2026
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:22,100
Yummy.

2027
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:25,040
You will be mine kittens.

2028
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,100
Look how cute that little guy is.

2029
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:33,820
Cat.

2030
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,680
Okay, we went to Tsurugaya.

2031
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:39,880
We can't go this way, right?

2032
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,700
There is road work.

2033
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:46,140
Adventurer's tavern.

2034
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,260
You will be mine.

2035
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:49,640
We can't go into soft map.

2036
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,620
Oh, we can go into Wodonald's.

2037
02:01:58,180 --> 02:02:02,740
This place has a limited time menu that comes with extra goodies, like anime or video game tie-in merch.

2038
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:07,100
You should stop by when you have the time.

2039
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,840
Oh my gosh, I thought that was actually me for a second.

2040
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:17,740
You're not eating yet?

2041
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,180
Let's have lunch together.

2042
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:25,980
Welcome, may I take your order?

2043
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:27,980
She's flirting with me.

2044
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,620
We're gonna have...

2045
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:36,410
It's not...

2046
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:38,370
Oh my god, my credit card is on the screen.

2047
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:40,630
You guys, don't look, okay?

2048
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:42,630
Don't look.

2049
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:47,170
This is no fast kitchen, so...

2050
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:49,310
But we'll still get the fries.

2051
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:51,730
How many burgers can I order?

2052
02:02:53,190 --> 02:02:55,310
What if I order a lot of the whole menu?

2053
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:03,980
Not enough money!

2054
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:06,480
Oh, I only have 800.

2055
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:19,000
We'll share a fry.

2056
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,980
We'll share a fry.

2057
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,620
I'll have a usual one serving of large fries.

2058
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:30,960
Just a moment please, we'll get it ready for you right away.

2059
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:34,520
Oh my gosh!

2060
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:49,090
Cinema.

2061
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:50,590
What's in theaters?

2062
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:53,730
The movie.

2063
02:03:56,650 --> 02:03:57,670
This is...

2064
02:03:58,010 --> 02:04:01,030
Manager-san, is that girl your little sister?

2065
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:02,910
The movie is being re-released.

2066
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:10,930
A must-see best 5 for those who like little sisters.

2067
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:14,230
I can't believe I'm seeing it on the big screen again.

2068
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:35,080
Let's watch it right now, before they stop showing it.

2069
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:43,980
Wait, we're still looking for a new maid.

2070
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,380
We don't have time for this.

2071
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:47,940
But...

2072
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:51,160
I still want to watch it.

2073
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:02,560
I really want to watch it.

2074
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:12,600
Let's keep looking for a new maid before I give in to temptation.

2075
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:17,880
What is this movie though?

2076
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:18,720
What is this rep?

2077
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,800
Is it JoJo?

2078
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,320
No.

2079
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:25,580
The logo at the bottom looks almost like it's supposed to look like JoJo.

2080
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:26,780
Like the logo, you know?

2081
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,540
The JoJo logo.

2082
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,000
One ticket please.

2083
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,640
I have... Wait, backup for the future.

2084
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,720
The celebration!

2085
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:57,100
That's my queen!

2086
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:06,140
The college student Rika visits an old lady living alone as part of her volunteer activities.

2087
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:10,060
But the house is haunted by the ghost of Kyarako.

2088
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:14,520
A housewife who was killed before she could celebrate her son's birthday.

2089
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:21,320
The people around Rika coincidentally visit the house on their birthdays, but start dying one after another.

2090
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:24,740
Finally, it's Rika's turn to join in the celebration.

2091
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:29,970
I love Ju-on!

2092
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:32,190
I love it.

2093
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:34,290
Backup for the future.

2094
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:35,970
The high schooler Murphy...

2095
02:06:44,150 --> 02:06:49,310
Oh my gosh, Murphy, you didn't tell me that you found the Adventurer's Tavern.

2096
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:49,650
Tavern.

2097
02:06:54,660 --> 02:07:01,280
Gets transported 30 years into the past by a time machine invented by his friend and scientist, Dr. Dog.

2098
02:07:05,380 --> 02:07:06,480
Dr. Dog.

2099
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:13,340
However, Murphy accidentally deletes the design data of the time machine in the past, which would mean the time machine would never exist.

2100
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:15,900
He'll have to recover the data with Dog's help.

2101
02:07:16,420 --> 02:07:18,040
But it's not as easy as it looks.

2102
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:21,700
Dr. Dog.

2103
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:28,000
Coco, who just became a high school student, gets lost on her way back from school.

2104
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:34,160
She finds herself in a bakery called Rabbit Room, where she meets her estranged half-brother and his pet kitten.

2105
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:38,580
Her life as a new little sister of pastry chef starts here.

2106
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:40,760
Why do I want to watch it so bad?

2107
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:47,680
I would watch.

2108
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:48,340
OK.

2109
02:07:50,780 --> 02:07:52,720
Can we... I mean, I have enough money.

2110
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:53,880
I have 2,000.

2111
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:56,000
But I could only buy one ticket.

2112
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,120
She probably wouldn't mind if I just watched it by myself.

2113
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:01,200
We don't know each other that well, you know.

2114
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,460
I wish I had someone to talk about movies with.

2115
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:09,600
Maybe I should go drinking with Yuasa-kun again.

2116
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,060
She'll hate you forever?

2117
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,200
You're right.

2118
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,000
Maybe I should watch...

2119
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:19,500
We're gonna go watch it?

2120
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,700
What if I buy the wrong movie?

2121
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,580
No, we'll go get it.

2122
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:37,020
Wait, don't tell me.

2123
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:40,260
Do you want to watch Is the Order a Little Sister, the movie?

2124
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:51,720
I mean, it's still the afternoon, so we'd still have plenty of time after the movie.

2125
02:08:57,640 --> 02:08:59,280
We'll get inspiration.

2126
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:02,200
We haven't done what we came for yet.

2127
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,960
We could look for a new maid after the movie.

2128
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:05,920
Couldn't we?

2129
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:15,560
Says the obvious.

2130
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:19,600
I suppose we can.

2131
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:21,040
Brilliant strategy manager.

2132
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:22,220
Let's do that.

2133
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:23,140
We're a genius.

2134
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:32,400
If you want to watch the movie so badly, I'll join you.

2135
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:44,980
Let's watch the movie and be reinvigorated by the holy power of emotos!

2136
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,920
That should help us with our search later.

2137
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,080
One student ticket, please.

2138
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:54,500
Here you go.

2139
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,000
One adult ticket, one student ticket.

2140
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:56,900
Enjoy your movie.

2141
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:15,640
It's me in the back.

2142
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:19,080
It's me in the back.

2143
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:23,440
Did you trip over your own feet again?

2144
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,940
Can't you even escort your own little sister properly?

2145
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:27,920
You're such a pathetic older brother.

2146
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:29,060
Baka!

2147
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,720
Kirino-chan, don't say that.

2148
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:34,120
Your brother did his best.

2149
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:34,980
Oh geez!

2150
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:46,760
Your brother did his best.

2151
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:47,840
Kiri, are you alright?

2152
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:48,640
Does it hurt?

2153
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:50,780
I'll kiss your boo-boo so it gets better.

2154
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:54,360
Coco, stop spoiling my brother.

2155
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:56,980
Helping a loser like him is just a waste of time.

2156
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:02,820
Buy recipes to unlock coffee ingredients.

2157
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:26,140
Yeah, Shiro does have a bad taste.

2158
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:31,000
How could you think Kirino-chan is the cutest when Kuro Inu Inu is right there?

2159
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:33,880
Kuro Inu!

2160
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:38,880
The main character didn't even deserve her.

2161
02:11:48,030 --> 02:11:49,270
So cute!

2162
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:51,690
Little sisters are so cute!

2163
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:56,610
Especially Kirino-chan with how she can't express herself well around her brother.

2164
02:11:56,610 --> 02:11:59,550
This much cuteness should be illegal!

2165
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:11,380
Welcome, welcome.

2166
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:12,800
I hope you had a fun stream.

2167
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:17,800
I'm Mint Phantom.

2168
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:18,960
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2169
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:20,340
Doki, thanks for the gifted.

2170
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,420
Rumia, thanks for the gifted.

2171
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:24,960
Mervy, thanks for the bag gifted.

2172
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:30,040
We're playing a silly game about having to save a maid cafe.

2173
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:34,800
And right now we're trying to find maids, but we're getting really distracted by little sisters.

2174
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:37,660
I can't see it, too.

2175
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:38,200
Thanks for the gifted!

2176
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:39,480
Teacup!

2177
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:42,420
You changed.

2178
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,660
You changed.

2179
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:44,620
Thanks for the gifted!

2180
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:45,680
Dokizo, thanks for the gifted!

2181
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,280
Starcated, thanks for the five gifted!

2182
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:49,100
Sirstreak, thanks for the five gifted!

2183
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:53,360
Tsundere, truly the most blessed trope among tropes.

2184
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:01,360
Serious angel.

2185
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:07,560
Coco-chan is really cute, too.

2186
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:11,660
She's so nice that she won't leave her brother's side when he's sad.

2187
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:13,160
She's such an angel.

2188
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:15,320
She's himself, thanks for the five gifted.

2189
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:29,780
If only I could be surrounded by cute imoutos like that.

2190
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,200
Oops, I can't start drooling here.

2191
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:48,520
Why did I have to be the imouto?

2192
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,640
I always wanted imouto, but I also always wanted a brother.

2193
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:56,940
I only have a sister.

2194
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:03,000
I want imouto.

2195
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:05,760
I don't want to be the imouto.

2196
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:09,120
Why can't I have a little sister?

2197
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:11,900
I think the god should give every single person a little sister.

2198
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:13,160
It's only fair.

2199
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:17,600
A brother.

2200
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,360
I've always wanted a brother.

2201
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:25,460
I love how Chido keeps releasing her power level.

2202
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:27,200
She's perfect.

2203
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:31,040
I hope our new maid will be as cute as a little sister.

2204
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:34,560
So true.

2205
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:35,560
I hope so too.

2206
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,960
Why can't we go to the guild now?

2207
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:38,700
Or to the tavern?

2208
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:41,360
Oh, it's getting dark and you haven't found anyone.

2209
02:14:41,680 --> 02:14:43,320
You decide to walk Chido to the station.

2210
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:53,260
Wait, if god gave everyone a little sister then the little sisters would also have a little sister and then the imouto overflow.

2211
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:56,560
Never ending imouto.

2212
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:58,080
True.

2213
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:06,120
Don't think too hard about it.

2214
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:10,180
Infinite imouto glitch.

2215
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:11,280
Basically.

2216
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:13,960
I should probably go home.

2217
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:19,940
It's been a while since I spent a whole afternoon here.

2218
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:24,120
The only people with imouto interests are the people who don't have IRL little sisters.

2219
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:25,020
Mostly.

2220
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:28,320
But that's why I have one imouto.

2221
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,160
Maybe.

2222
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:39,040
Well then goodbye manager.

2223
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:40,980
See you tomorrow.

2224
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:47,760
Wait a minute.

2225
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:50,020
We were supposed to find a new maid today.

2226
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:50,620
Where are we?

2227
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:56,760
Wait, what do we do?

2228
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:59,060
We won't be able to open the cafe tomorrow at this rate.

2229
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:03,160
Oh my god, hot girls walking by.

2230
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,600
Sorry, coming through.

2231
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:09,460
Oh my gosh, pink haired girl.

2232
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:12,720
Sorry.

2233
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:14,560
Thanks.

2234
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:15,960
Oh my god, look at them.

2235
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:17,320
They are the hot girls.

2236
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,780
They are the hot girls in Nipponbashi.

2237
02:16:20,620 --> 02:16:20,860
Wow!

2238
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:26,560
They look popular.

2239
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,080
They don't need us.

2240
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:36,240
Oh wait, I forgot to buy lipstick.

2241
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:37,480
I'm running out.

2242
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:40,820
You guys go first.

2243
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:42,480
We can go.

2244
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:44,560
Oh, red haired girl is...

2245
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:45,440
Elizabeth?

2246
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:46,840
Herb?

2247
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:48,140
Tan herb?

2248
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:49,860
They are not popular.

2249
02:16:50,060 --> 02:16:51,520
They are not good enough to get voiced.

2250
02:16:51,980 --> 02:16:52,900
We can go with you.

2251
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:56,800
No, I'll be fine on my own.

2252
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,580
Oh my gosh, I like her.

2253
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:00,460
I like her buns.

2254
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:03,520
And her... and her... and her buns.

2255
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,100
Damn girl!

2256
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,540
Mio, why do you keep sneaking away on your own lately?

2257
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:11,580
Wait, don't tell me.

2258
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,460
Did you get a boyfriend?

2259
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:19,800
Just gyaru, Monika.

2260
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,500
Kind of.

2261
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:23,500
I see it.

2262
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:24,620
No way.

2263
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:27,020
If I get a boyfriend, you two would be the first to know.

2264
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:29,500
For real?

2265
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:34,740
I know I would keep it a secret for a while until we like start talking about boys and stuff.

2266
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:38,240
And then I'd take out a pic of my boyfriend and be all like...

2267
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:40,500
You guys have no idea how annoying my boyfriend is.

2268
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:43,580
I'll come like... so you don't even see it coming.

2269
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:49,300
Misaki-poi.

2270
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:50,540
That's so you.

2271
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:54,780
Okay, but if it isn't a boy, what is it?

2272
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,560
Where do you keep sneaking off to?

2273
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:02,800
The arcade.

2274
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:05,760
I still haven't cleared the limited time event yet.

2275
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:07,940
Oh, okay.

2276
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:10,540
Wait, how do I do a British accent?

2277
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:12,880
You go do that then.

2278
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,160
We'll go home.

2279
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:16,540
Bye.

2280
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:18,160
Tell us if you do get a boyfriend.

2281
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:23,500
You

2282
02:18:30,050 --> 02:18:34,350
guys, I'm so sorry.

2283
02:18:34,490 --> 02:18:38,690
I keep just thinking that I'm clicking here and I'm not looking up here.

2284
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:40,910
So I keep not seeing that there's prompts.

2285
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:41,750
I'm so sorry.

2286
02:18:42,050 --> 02:18:43,370
I don't know what I just clicked again.

2287
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:50,710
She said something about a limited time event.

2288
02:18:54,090 --> 02:18:55,810
Manager, let's follow her!

2289
02:18:56,150 --> 02:18:57,270
Oh, I called her cute?

2290
02:18:57,630 --> 02:18:59,690
Okay, I would've picked that anyway.

2291
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:00,690
You're so right.

2292
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:02,910
What?

2293
02:19:05,330 --> 02:19:06,150
I'm just walking!

2294
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:08,830
I'm walking here!

2295
02:19:09,130 --> 02:19:09,930
What are you talking about?

2296
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:13,990
Oh, okay.

2297
02:19:14,110 --> 02:19:15,990
So we have to do it without her noticing.

2298
02:19:17,810 --> 02:19:20,090
Oh, I see that the level goes up.

2299
02:19:23,490 --> 02:19:23,930
Nothing?

2300
02:19:24,890 --> 02:19:25,330
Nothing?

2301
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:28,690
Nothing?

2302
02:19:37,170 --> 02:19:38,230
Oh, we can hide.

2303
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:38,950
I just noticed.

2304
02:19:39,050 --> 02:19:39,590
Oh, where'd you go?

2305
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:46,890
Nowhere to hide here.

2306
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,440
Sneaking mission, guys.

2307
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:59,080
Sneaking mission.

2308
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:02,840
There's the game center.

2309
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:09,540
She went into the arcade, just as I thought!

2310
02:20:12,060 --> 02:20:14,180
If this goes well, we'll convince her in no time!

2311
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:20,200
Let's go, manager, for Fuwa Fuwa!

2312
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:25,180
Is there a way to get into...

2313
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:30,340
Maybe Adventure's Tavern unlocks here and I go through some back roads or something.

2314
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:31,300
I don't know.

2315
02:20:33,420 --> 02:20:34,120
Fuwa Fuwa.

2316
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:35,060
Fuwa Fuwa.

2317
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:38,100
What do we do?

2318
02:20:38,680 --> 02:20:41,560
We've lost sight of her!

2319
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:42,380
Oh, okay, nevermind.

2320
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,460
Oh, okay, you can't lose sight of her, but you can't... Okay, let her see you either.

2321
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:01,620
Uh-oh.

2322
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:06,000
Okay, I have to hide in there, I think.

2323
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:12,720
Yeah, we have to hide here.

2324
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:13,040
Okay.

2325
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:18,980
Oh, wait!

2326
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:20,540
Let me hide!

2327
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,120
Okay, hold on.

2328
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,300
Oh gosh!

2329
02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:26,220
Oh my god, please!

2330
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:33,400
Okay, restart.

2331
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:41,860
Okay.

2332
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:44,360
Turn around.

2333
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:48,500
Hide.

2334
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:49,120
There we go.

2335
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:49,460
Okay.

2336
02:21:52,360 --> 02:21:53,460
Vtuber Y, sorry!

2337
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:54,960
It was...

2338
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:01,560
Manager, come closer!

2339
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:03,020
We can see outside from here!

2340
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:17,540
By the time you notice that Shiro smells kind of nice, you're practically attached to each other!

2341
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:20,960
Notice like this, you attempt to put some distance between you, but...

2342
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:27,100
Manager, don't move!

2343
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:27,900
We're losing her!

2344
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,000
Shiro pulls you back in.

2345
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:35,520
Your face is touched!

2346
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,520
I'm sorry.

2347
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:43,300
I don't think the heartbeat is just from following her.

2348
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:46,540
What was that?

2349
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:48,520
In your panic...

2350
02:22:50,060 --> 02:22:52,840
One of you accidentally pushes a button on the photo machine.

2351
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:56,500
A joyful voice rings out of the speakers, oblivious of the bad timing.

2352
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,200
Congratulations!

2353
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:00,540
You won a chance for one free photo!

2354
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:03,440
Get ready for your free photo!

2355
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:05,480
Say cheese!

2356
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:10,100
Thank you for coming!

2357
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:11,180
See you again!

2358
02:23:21,310 --> 02:23:21,830
Oh

2359
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,600
my god, he is such a string bean!

2360
02:23:33,790 --> 02:23:34,570
It's okay.

2361
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:40,570
They put all of the effort into the girl.

2362
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:41,630
That's all that matters, right?

2363
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:47,050
All the drawing effort.

2364
02:23:48,330 --> 02:23:49,970
Must have been my imagination.

2365
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:53,910
She's gone.

2366
02:23:55,870 --> 02:23:56,990
Alright, let's get out.

2367
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:06,770
That was close.

2368
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:08,590
At least we got a free photo out of it.

2369
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:09,990
Looks like they printed...

2370
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:13,930
Looks like they printed out too.

2371
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:15,210
What should we do with them?

2372
02:24:15,470 --> 02:24:15,990
Eat it.

2373
02:24:16,470 --> 02:24:17,970
Give Shiro one of the photos?

2374
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:20,930
You keep both for yourself.

2375
02:24:21,350 --> 02:24:23,470
What are you going to do with both of them?

2376
02:24:27,890 --> 02:24:28,890
Keep both.

2377
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:47,140
I'm going to put one in the bathroom where the toilet is and one in the shower room.

2378
02:24:47,780 --> 02:24:49,460
Anyway, let's follow her upstairs.

2379
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:05,320
Right there should be perfect.

2380
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:06,600
Look, there she is!

2381
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:10,880
Actually, you know how some people... Okay, I'll put one in the shower room.

2382
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:16,960
And then, you know how some people put the pictures of something above their bed?

2383
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:18,620
That's where I'll put the other one.

2384
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:22,180
So I go to bed and I look up at my ceiling and I'm like...

2385
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:28,360
Right here should be perfect.

2386
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:29,460
Look, there she is!

2387
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:32,520
Excuse me.

2388
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:43,100
Oh man, I got to do the limited time boss fight but none of my teammates are online.

2389
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:49,280
Men keep a wallet copy.

2390
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:50,880
Really?

2391
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:56,500
I have check keys in my wallet.

2392
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:57,180
Is it the same?

2393
02:26:06,900 --> 02:26:09,820
Not even SR46 is online.

2394
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:12,980
Shiiro?

2395
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:15,380
Oh my gosh.

2396
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:19,440
4 can be read as Shi and 6 can be read as Ro.

2397
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,480
It's Shiiro.

2398
02:26:40,070 --> 02:26:42,890
All you need to do is register with this machine.

2399
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:48,720
Now I'm standing here watching?

2400
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:50,980
Play the adjacent arcade machine.

2401
02:26:55,380 --> 02:26:58,940
Look how bouncy she is, even in this seat.

2402
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:02,380
This girl doesn't need anymore coffee.

2403
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:13,720
Because the cafe only has coffee, that's all she's been drinking and eating for the past whole year that the manager has been gone.

2404
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:19,760
So she's just always got that caffeine in her.

2405
02:27:22,820 --> 02:27:26,400
Manager, this limited boss drops rare items.

2406
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:35,700
I don't know if we can win with just 2 people, but let's do our best.

2407
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:44,440
Wait, my friend is online too, so we can fight in a team of 3.

2408
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:46,860
Oh, I wonder who your friend is.

2409
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:49,240
Kokoro joined your team.

2410
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:50,300
Kokoro!

2411
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:54,080
I have a box I keep at...

2412
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:57,600
I thought you said you have a box you keep at Daiso.

2413
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:03,860
I have a box I bought at Daiso that I keep my check keys for Checky Meshy and plus extra sleeves when I buy new ones.

2414
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:04,960
Definitely recommend it.

2415
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:08,880
I have to go to Daiso and get one.

2416
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:13,260
Wait, can you send a picture later, Ashes, on Twitter?

2417
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:14,400
Can you post a picture?

2418
02:28:15,780 --> 02:28:19,040
I have to get another Checky album.

2419
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:21,760
Because I have...

2420
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:23,100
1, 2, 3, 4...

2421
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,240
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

2422
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:32,920
I had to rearrange my bromides recently because I had to...

2423
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:34,640
I filled up another album of them.

2424
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:47,100
I have to get another Checky album because all of my...

2425
02:28:47,100 --> 02:28:51,800
I have a Checky album that's completely full now of one idol.

2426
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:55,440
But the Checky album is not themed to her.

2427
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:56,960
So I have to get another one.

2428
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:01,800
Now I gotta...

2429
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:06,800
I think all 5 are full too, so...

2430
02:29:08,660 --> 02:29:10,340
I gotta buy another one.

2431
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:13,340
My albums are full.

2432
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:20,040
After a grueling battle you emerge victorious.

2433
02:29:27,740 --> 02:29:29,140
We did it!

2434
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:31,020
GG desu!

2435
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:42,220
Thank God!

2436
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:45,020
Thank God Shiro hopped on in time.

2437
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:47,800
No idea why they brought a newbie with them though.

2438
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:49,660
GG desu!

2439
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:53,320
Kano-chan, she...

2440
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:55,860
No, there's no way.

2441
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,100
Are you Kokoro?

2442
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:04,280
No way, are you Shiro?

2443
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:06,560
Are you friends?

2444
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:13,920
She's Kokoro, the player who beat the boss battle with us just now.

2445
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:16,920
Stargaze, welcome to Manbuship.

2446
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:17,500
Thank you!

2447
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:21,420
Maybe...

2448
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:23,120
She's my best partner.

2449
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:29,180
Such a small world, right?

2450
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:32,740
I never thought it'd go like this, but I'm really happy to meet you in real life.

2451
02:30:34,860 --> 02:30:36,200
Same here, Shiro.

2452
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:43,160
I'll introduce myself for realsies then.

2453
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:44,680
My name is Miyu Kosaka.

2454
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:53,420
I'm Shiro Kamigishi and this is the manager.

2455
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:56,480
This is the manager.

2456
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:00,240
Thank you for the pizza!

2457
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:04,560
I have pizza for dinner.

2458
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,500
Well, it's leftover pizza.

2459
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:09,340
The manager?

2460
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:11,700
Nice to meet you.

2461
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:15,400
Not at the arcade, right?

2462
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:16,580
What does he manage?

2463
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:23,880
We run a maid cafe called Fuwa Fuwa Cafe.

2464
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:25,760
It's on the west side of Electric Street.

2465
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:30,100
Cute!

2466
02:31:30,460 --> 02:31:31,240
That sounds cool.

2467
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:32,600
I'll go visit next time.

2468
02:31:39,380 --> 02:31:44,100
Oh no, time to trauma dump on to this girl we just kind of met today.

2469
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:46,460
Thank you so much.

2470
02:31:46,780 --> 02:31:50,100
The thing is though, we're actually in serious trouble right now.

2471
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:53,680
Shiro tells Miyu about the cafe and its situation.

2472
02:32:13,460 --> 02:32:15,740
You're in serious, serious trouble?

2473
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:22,780
Yeah, the VA and the cash in this are like stocks actually.

2474
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:24,300
Miyu,

2475
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:29,020
do you want to be a maid?

2476
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:31,860
Like right now?

2477
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:36,720
I know it's a lot to ask.

2478
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,920
You don't have to say yes.

2479
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:43,920
But please, at least come take a look at our cafe!

2480
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:47,480
I like how bouncy the girls are though.

2481
02:32:47,580 --> 02:32:48,240
It's fun.

2482
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:52,160
Doing part time jobs at restaurants is a way to earn some more pocket money.

2483
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:54,480
What does that mean?

2484
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:56,820
We're not going to get enough money?

2485
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:04,000
Welcome back, master.

2486
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:04,940
Sorry to make you wait.

2487
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:07,980
Give me a second.

2488
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:10,040
I like them bouncy.

2489
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:12,300
Shiro quickly dashes into the locker room.

2490
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:13,200
Oh, she's got a change.

2491
02:33:15,880 --> 02:33:18,040
She's a totally different person offline.

2492
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:21,300
But she's like online now.

2493
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,680
She's a real go-getter online.

2494
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:33,460
She gets real angry when she loses too.

2495
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:34,840
Kind of scary even.

2496
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:35,760
She's a gamer!

2497
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:37,000
She's a gamer!

2498
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:42,600
You can't picture it, huh?

2499
02:33:42,820 --> 02:33:43,160
I getcha.

2500
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:49,240
Alright, and did you know that Shiro...

2501
02:33:49,240 --> 02:33:53,940
They haven't met in real life until today, but it seems like they're already really good friends.

2502
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:54,880
That's so cute!

2503
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:57,120
My god, she's really mean.

2504
02:33:57,220 --> 02:33:57,500
Stop!

2505
02:34:07,370 --> 02:34:08,230
I'm back!

2506
02:34:08,250 --> 02:34:09,110
What were you talking about?

2507
02:34:14,750 --> 02:34:17,490
Is that your maid uniform?

2508
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:35,850
So cute!

2509
02:34:35,850 --> 02:34:40,050
Do you want to try on the uniform too, Miyu?

2510
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:43,930
You'd look really good in it.

2511
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:45,000
I'm sure of it!

2512
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:56,690
I'll show you to the locker room!

2513
02:35:00,030 --> 02:35:05,010
The two girls practically skip towards the locker room, chatting away happily.

2514
02:35:10,330 --> 02:35:12,530
Leaving you... all alone.

2515
02:35:15,450 --> 02:35:18,310
No choice but to wait, I guess.

2516
02:35:21,090 --> 02:35:22,710
15 minutes later.

2517
02:35:22,890 --> 02:35:24,610
Holy moly, it took so long.

2518
02:35:28,770 --> 02:35:30,750
What do you think?

2519
02:35:35,430 --> 02:35:39,490
If the devs were to reveal that Shiro was inspired by you, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

2520
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:41,590
Stop, I don't think so.

2521
02:35:41,690 --> 02:35:43,890
I think it's probably just a coinkidink.

2522
02:35:45,550 --> 02:35:47,310
Miyu has changed into a maid outfit too.

2523
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:53,770
Hey, you don't have to stare at me like that.

2524
02:35:55,210 --> 02:35:56,410
It really suits you.

2525
02:35:56,410 --> 02:36:00,050
It really does suit you, Miyu.

2526
02:36:00,410 --> 02:36:02,270
The manager should be me, not him.

2527
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:03,430
Me too.

2528
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:10,030
I'm starting to get embarrassed.

2529
02:36:12,350 --> 02:36:14,490
Won't you consider becoming a maid?

2530
02:36:14,810 --> 02:36:16,390
I'll sound really manager-like.

2531
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:24,880
Fine, I'll give it a shot.

2532
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:29,760
Just don't expect too much from me.

2533
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:33,040
Manager-san, you did it!

2534
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:34,540
You're a new maid!

2535
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:36,520
We did it, manager!

2536
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:39,080
We recruited a new maid!

2537
02:36:40,020 --> 02:36:41,720
You and Shiro cheer happily.

2538
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:43,240
Finally, it's over.

2539
02:36:46,350 --> 02:36:48,010
It's a little hop.

2540
02:36:48,330 --> 02:36:50,030
It's so funny.

2541
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:56,360
Tomorrow's the day Fufu will finally reopen.

2542
02:36:59,640 --> 02:36:59,900
Tomorrow?

2543
02:37:00,180 --> 02:37:00,460
That soon?

2544
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:02,520
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

2545
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:06,420
Of course, I've been waiting for this day for so long.

2546
02:37:06,420 --> 02:37:08,720
Then, Miyu and I will go shopping.

2547
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:12,160
Manager-san, please prepare for tomorrow and rest up.

2548
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:22,480
No, Miyu and I still have work to do.

2549
02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:29,900
Manager-san, you can't listen.

2550
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:38,720
Shiro and Miyu leave the cafe together.

2551
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:40,480
I should go back to the apartment.

2552
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:42,960
Miyu joined your staff!

2553
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:44,880
You returned to your room and slept soundly.

2554
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:45,800
It's morning!

2555
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:48,220
Time to manage the cafe for the very first time!

2556
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:48,780
Wait.

2557
02:37:50,080 --> 02:37:52,160
Yes, I do want to save my progress.

2558
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:54,440
We cleared chapter 2.

2559
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:59,120
Oh, there we go.

2560
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:01,480
Playthrough 1?

2561
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:01,860
Wow.

2562
02:38:02,260 --> 02:38:04,380
I wonder if there's some new game plus stuff then.

2563
02:38:05,460 --> 02:38:06,140
Nice.

2564
02:38:06,700 --> 02:38:07,880
Nice, nice, nice.

2565
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:09,180
We have 1,000 yen.

2566
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:12,740
We have a single sentence to our name.

2567
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:14,120
Oh gosh.

2568
02:38:22,140 --> 02:38:23,560
Welcome to membership!

2569
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:30,730
I think I remember seeing that there's like...

2570
02:38:30,730 --> 02:38:34,490
I mean, we already saw Valhalla and some other...

2571
02:38:37,610 --> 02:38:39,110
other game collabs.

2572
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:41,770
But I think there's like a few more too, so...

2573
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:43,290
That's fine.

2574
02:38:43,390 --> 02:38:44,110
That's fine.

2575
02:38:44,770 --> 02:38:45,810
Different routes probably.

2576
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:47,770
Probably, probably, probably.

2577
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:52,330
Guys, I think I'm going to end it here for today.

2578
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:55,370
So far, this is so cute.

2579
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:56,630
I'm so sad we couldn't...

2580
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:58,510
I thought we would get... What was her name?

2581
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:06,730
Fa...

2582
02:39:09,790 --> 02:39:10,230
Fafna.

2583
02:39:12,990 --> 02:39:16,890
I thought we would get Fafna today, but...

2584
02:39:16,890 --> 02:39:19,150
Unfortunately, we got to meet...

2585
02:39:19,150 --> 02:39:20,950
We only got to meet her, which actually...

2586
02:39:20,950 --> 02:39:22,070
I shouldn't say unfortunately.

2587
02:39:22,810 --> 02:39:23,170
You know what?

2588
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:25,250
That was a splendid encounter.

2589
02:39:26,690 --> 02:39:28,750
Anytime I get to meet a chunibyo...

2590
02:39:30,090 --> 02:39:31,890
I am blessed.

2591
02:39:33,330 --> 02:39:35,310
I feel like I could go back to heaven.

2592
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:37,030
Wait, Mint, you like maids?

2593
02:39:37,150 --> 02:39:38,630
Don't get it twisted.

2594
02:39:39,310 --> 02:39:40,990
Don't get it twisted.

2595
02:39:43,790 --> 02:39:45,550
I love maids.

2596
02:39:45,890 --> 02:39:47,250
I don't just like maids.

2597
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:49,150
I live, breathe...

2598
02:39:49,150 --> 02:39:50,210
Well, I'm dead.

2599
02:39:50,730 --> 02:39:52,350
If I were alive...

2600
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:54,770
If I were alive, I would...

2601
02:39:54,770 --> 02:39:56,690
I would breathe.

2602
02:39:56,890 --> 02:39:58,070
I would sleep.

2603
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:59,670
I would eat maids.

2604
02:39:59,910 --> 02:40:02,270
I love maids.

2605
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:05,610
They are my afterlife stream.

2606
02:40:05,890 --> 02:40:09,930
It's my ectoplasm blood stream.

2607
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:11,990
It's in my DNA.

2608
02:40:12,610 --> 02:40:14,230
I love maids.

2609
02:40:21,250 --> 02:40:23,090
Hold on.

2610
02:40:24,310 --> 02:40:25,150
It's my birthday tomorrow.

2611
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:26,290
Can I get a happy birthday from my Oshi?

2612
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:27,410
Of course!

2613
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:31,930
Happy birthday to you.

2614
02:40:32,170 --> 02:40:34,810
Happy birthday to you.

2615
02:40:34,810 --> 02:40:38,710
Happy birthday, perfected flies.

2616
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:44,210
Happy birthday to you.

2617
02:40:45,330 --> 02:40:47,010
Happy birthday!

2618
02:40:47,790 --> 02:40:49,010
Thank you for the superchat!

2619
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:53,170
If you love maids so much, why don't you become one?

2620
02:40:55,310 --> 02:40:56,230
Check it.

2621
02:40:57,430 --> 02:40:58,010
Headband.

2622
02:41:00,110 --> 02:41:00,790
Apron.

2623
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:05,880
Thigh high.

2624
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,500
I became the maid.

2625
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:11,160
Ahoge.

2626
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:15,420
Check it.

2627
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:16,760
I became the maid.

2628
02:41:17,780 --> 02:41:19,160
I became the maid.

2629
02:41:26,650 --> 02:41:28,290
Feed us Omurice.

2630
02:41:28,430 --> 02:41:30,790
I can serve you Omurice.

2631
02:41:32,030 --> 02:41:33,210
Does cuteness check too?

2632
02:41:39,870 --> 02:41:40,770
I guess...

2633
02:41:45,610 --> 02:41:47,970
Every maid is technically cute.

2634
02:41:49,310 --> 02:41:50,490
Because they are a maid.

2635
02:41:51,250 --> 02:41:55,310
But I'm only cute because my mama made me that way.

2636
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:57,890
That's why.

2637
02:42:01,070 --> 02:42:02,110
Maids are so cool.

2638
02:42:02,150 --> 02:42:02,990
I wish they were real.

2639
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:06,010
I wish so too.

2640
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:09,210
I'm so glad I live in a...

2641
02:42:09,210 --> 02:42:12,870
Gosh, I'm so glad I'm dead in a timeline where maids exist.

2642
02:42:14,690 --> 02:42:16,430
I hope you can visit Osaka one day.

2643
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:17,010
Me too!

2644
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:20,510
Me too, me too, me too.

2645
02:42:29,410 --> 02:42:31,870
I want to go to Nipponbashi now.

2646
02:42:33,330 --> 02:42:34,390
Sure princess, thank you!

2647
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:39,080
Oh sorry.

2648
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:40,620
There it is.

2649
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:43,280
Remember when Chiyo thinks she isn't cute?

2650
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:44,180
Yeah, she's you.

2651
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:47,300
You're cute because you are Minto.

2652
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:50,480
I'm Minky.

2653
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:54,980
I'm Minky now.

2654
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:58,180
I reject Minto.

2655
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:00,620
I'm Minky.

2656
02:43:00,620 --> 02:43:00,680
Minky.

2657
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:10,540
This is fun though guys.

2658
02:43:10,660 --> 02:43:11,640
Thank you so much.

2659
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:13,580
I hope you guys enjoyed so far.

2660
02:43:15,180 --> 02:43:16,280
Check please.

2661
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:18,720
What is this?

2662
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:22,460
Minky and...

2663
02:43:22,460 --> 02:43:24,300
No, don't combine it.

2664
02:43:26,360 --> 02:43:28,440
I actually have to send this.

2665
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:33,140
Playism actually asked if I could send when I play the game to them.

2666
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:35,540
So I will be sending this to them and be like...

2667
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:39,240
Hi, I think Chiyo is accidentally me.

2668
02:43:40,460 --> 02:43:40,940
Cool.

2669
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:45,360
But yeah, I don't know.

2670
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:49,200
I might play this, like finish it off stream.

2671
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:53,360
When I have time, which is...

2672
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:55,000
I...

2673
02:43:57,420 --> 02:43:58,460
I think...

2674
02:43:58,460 --> 02:43:59,440
I don't know.

2675
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:04,100
I don't know if I want to finish streaming it or what.

2676
02:44:08,380 --> 02:44:09,100
We'll see.

2677
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:10,340
Please stream it.

2678
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:11,000
I'll think about it.

2679
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:11,660
Sorry.

2680
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:13,520
Minky extra cute.

2681
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:14,240
Minky!

2682
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:15,940
Minky!

2683
02:44:19,240 --> 02:44:21,660
We need to know how made cafes are run.

2684
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:24,560
I feel like we didn't really get to any of the gameplay, right?

2685
02:44:24,740 --> 02:44:27,460
Like the actual taking care of the made cafe part.

2686
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:29,680
So, maybe I will stream it.

2687
02:44:30,700 --> 02:44:35,480
Saying you're cute and got it from your mama resurfaced a song I got it from my mama by Will.i.am.

2688
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,620
And now I want to hear you sing it.

2689
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:38,560
I don't know that one.

2690
02:44:44,230 --> 02:44:45,610
You're still in the tutorial.

2691
02:44:45,610 --> 02:44:47,250
We're on chapter 2.

2692
02:44:47,610 --> 02:44:50,590
But they asked if I don't stream past chapter 6.

2693
02:44:51,650 --> 02:44:52,130
So...

2694
02:44:53,790 --> 02:44:55,630
It's a visual novel, so no gameplay.

2695
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:56,430
No, no.

2696
02:44:56,550 --> 02:44:59,930
I think there's actually some taking care of...

2697
02:44:59,930 --> 02:45:01,150
The cafe, right?

2698
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:04,610
Because we buy recipes and I think we have to make them...

2699
02:45:06,030 --> 02:45:07,610
I think we have to make them...

2700
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:11,750
In the cafe.

2701
02:45:12,130 --> 02:45:12,830
There is gameplay.

2702
02:45:12,950 --> 02:45:13,670
Yeah, I thought so.

2703
02:45:13,710 --> 02:45:14,310
I thought so.

2704
02:45:17,850 --> 02:45:18,990
It's chapter 6.

2705
02:45:19,070 --> 02:45:20,430
Shiro gets the minky skin.

2706
02:45:22,610 --> 02:45:23,190
There is gameplay.

2707
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:24,090
It's literally up next.

2708
02:45:24,310 --> 02:45:24,790
See?

2709
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:25,470
I told you.

2710
02:45:25,550 --> 02:45:25,990
I told you.

2711
02:45:26,430 --> 02:45:28,610
I think because we got that little sneak peek...

2712
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:30,610
When we made...

2713
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:32,790
Made...

2714
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:35,510
When we did the cafe.

2715
02:45:38,810 --> 02:45:39,290
Ok.

2716
02:45:41,070 --> 02:45:41,550
Okidoki.

2717
02:45:42,210 --> 02:45:43,070
I'm gonna get going.

2718
02:45:43,150 --> 02:45:44,370
My throat hurts because...

2719
02:45:44,370 --> 02:45:46,370
I've been doing a lot of practicing for...

2720
02:45:48,310 --> 02:45:49,350
For the concert.

2721
02:45:49,790 --> 02:45:51,710
And I've had some other stuff that I've been recording.

2722
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:54,930
Some stuff that is pretty cool.

2723
02:45:55,390 --> 02:45:57,190
That you will hear about later this month.

2724
02:45:57,750 --> 02:45:58,250
Maybe.

2725
02:45:59,950 --> 02:46:01,130
So, yeah.

2726
02:46:01,790 --> 02:46:04,630
I'm gonna go to...

2727
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:05,130
Minto!

2728
02:46:05,930 --> 02:46:06,850
Thank you guys.

2729
02:46:07,310 --> 02:46:08,770
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2730
02:46:10,350 --> 02:46:11,550
Oh, let's see.

2731
02:46:11,730 --> 02:46:12,690
Can we... Hold on.

2732
02:46:14,630 --> 02:46:16,730
Let me see if I can do this.

2733
02:46:17,230 --> 02:46:18,070
Oh, what the heck?

2734
02:46:19,530 --> 02:46:20,070
Do this.

2735
02:46:20,710 --> 02:46:21,490
Do this.

2736
02:46:21,850 --> 02:46:24,010
Maybe if I subject you to this.

2737
02:46:24,190 --> 02:46:24,610
Let's see.

2738
02:46:37,130 --> 02:46:37,910
I can't.

2739
02:46:38,110 --> 02:46:38,670
Never mind.

2740
02:46:38,830 --> 02:46:40,030
I was gonna redirect to Doki.

2741
02:46:40,650 --> 02:46:42,390
I was gonna read Doki, but...

2742
02:46:43,210 --> 02:46:45,390
She doesn't have it turned on, so...

2743
02:46:46,270 --> 02:46:46,910
Never mind.

2744
02:46:48,050 --> 02:46:49,790
You can watch her if you want.

2745
02:46:49,870 --> 02:46:51,050
I was gonna subject you to Fortnite.

2746
02:46:53,970 --> 02:46:55,770
I was gonna subject you to Fortnite.

2747
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:57,030
Oh well.

2748
02:46:57,490 --> 02:46:59,730
Anyway, manual read if you want.

2749
02:47:00,090 --> 02:47:01,630
If you want to go bother her.

2750
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:04,870
Otsu Minto!

2751
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:06,790
Itterasshaimase!

2752
02:47:07,350 --> 02:47:07,730
Everybody!

2753
02:47:08,730 --> 02:47:09,390
Bye bye!

2754
02:47:09,750 --> 02:47:10,750
Bye bye, have a good night!

2755
02:47:10,750 --> 02:47:12,550
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!

2756
02:47:13,010 --> 02:47:13,890
Thanks for the stream!

2757
02:47:14,530 --> 02:47:15,050
See you!

2758
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:15,870
Bye bye!

2759
02:47:47,540 --> 02:47:49,380
It just looks like the game again.

2760
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:53,140
It just looks like we are in the game.

2761
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:53,960
Right?

2762
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:56,360
What

2763
02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:06,780
do you mean I'm not subscribed to Doki?

2764
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:07,820
Because I am.

2765
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:10,400
She doesn't have the raids turned on.

2766
02:48:15,050 --> 02:48:16,590
I'm literally subscribed to her.

2767
02:48:19,840 --> 02:48:21,540
She has to turn it on on her end.

2768
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:22,120
It's not me.

2769
02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:23,920
Oh, she's a big liar.

2770
02:48:24,240 --> 02:48:24,900
That's what she said.

2771
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,420
No, that would mean she's not subscribed to me.

2772
02:48:28,180 --> 02:48:28,620
What?

2773
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:29,940
OK, I'm gonna go talk.

2774
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:30,580
What?

2775
02:48:34,770 --> 02:48:36,510
That means she's not subscribed to me!

2776
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:41,800
Not the other way around.

2777
02:48:51,050 --> 02:48:51,690
OK, bye.
