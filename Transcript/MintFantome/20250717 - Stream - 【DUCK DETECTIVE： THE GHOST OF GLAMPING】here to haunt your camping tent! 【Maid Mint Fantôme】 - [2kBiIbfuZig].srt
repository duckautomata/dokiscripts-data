1
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Howdy.

2
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
It was one of those nights.

3
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,700
Those chilly nights.

4
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,100
Just sends a shiver up your spine.

5
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,780
Thinking about her as the water droplets hit the window.

6
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,720
How it's my fault.

7
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,500
We're in this sticky situation.

8
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,600
But I know... there's just one thing that I gotta do.

9
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,920
And that's find justice.

10
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,420
We need to go grayscale for this.

11
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,020
I thought about it.

12
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,040
Hard-boiled Minto?

13
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,440
I only microwaved you for 30 seconds.

14
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,280
To become this...

15
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Broiled...

16
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,300
I only need...

17
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,940
One second.

18
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,900
Hello, everybody.

19
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,200
Welcome back.

20
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,420
Hello, or welcome in.

21
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:35,940
Hello.

22
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,920
Spank, thank you so much for the...

23
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,080
Super Tot.

24
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,880
Looking good, boss.

25
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Thanks, Wally.

26
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Um...

27
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,840
A long time ago, I played the first Duck Detective.

28
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,680
Something about salami.

29
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:55,900
Oh!

30
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,420
It says it right behind me.

31
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,400
Secret salami.

32
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,200
I don't...

33
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,320
I don't...

34
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
So this is the second one.

35
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,300
I don't think you need to know about the first one.

36
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,420
To play...

37
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,480
Or to watch...

38
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,420
There's some recurring characters, but...

39
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,820
Yeah!

40
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,060
Congrats on the surgery?

41
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,420
Huh?

42
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,000
Huh?

43
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,160
Huh?

44
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,180
How's the old voice box?

45
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,240
I went to...

46
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
The booth spittle yesterday.

47
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,100
And I saw...

48
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,160
The doctor...

49
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,340
And...

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,960
I...

51
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,330
I...

52
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,790
Oh...

53
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,690
Oh...

54
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:38,950
Oh...

55
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:40,970
Oh...

56
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,690
Oh...

57
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,090
Skyward!

58
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,010
Congratulations!

59
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,830
Oh my goooooosh...

60
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,050
Congratulations!

61
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,570
Oh my god, my first ever...

62
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,870
You guys call it an endoscopy.

63
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,870
I went...

64
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,150
And I was...

65
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,510
I was shaking...

66
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,470
Like a cold leaf...

67
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,310
In fall.

68
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,350
I was like...

69
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,470
And the doctor came in, and he was like, what seems to be the problem?

70
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,570
And I said, my voice.

71
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,910
And my

72
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,050
throat hurts.

73
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,050
And I'm scared.

74
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,190
And he said, okay, miss.

75
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:40,230
And before he came in, the nurse shoved a pipe down my nose.

76
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,910
That part hurt the most.

77
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,210
And he squeezed, and then it gave me the medicine, the numbing stuff.

78
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,410
I didn't like that one.

79
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,190
Oh my gosh, it almost felt like I was getting a COVID test, you know?

80
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,310
Oh, it was terrible.

81
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,750
And then the doctor was like, okay, well, um, this, this doctor's office is very old.

82
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,030
So, um, I can't have you, I can't put your seat back.

83
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,270
Well, he said, let me try.

84
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,510
And he did.

85
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,790
And it was like, the chair.

86
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,350
And I was like, it's okay.

87
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,330
I'll sit up.

88
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,490
And he was like, yeah, um, the doctor was very nice.

89
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,430
Like an old rollercoaster.

90
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,230
Just like Toad's Wild Ride.

91
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,990
But, um, I was like, I'll sit up.

92
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,710
And he was very nice.

93
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:48,810
He was like, one of those kinds of doctors that's very, like, deadpan, but they're funny.

94
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,630
You know what I mean?

95
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,570
And, um, and he was like, are you feeling the numbing medicine?

96
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,950
And I was like, doc, I'm really scared.

97
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,370
Look at my hands.

98
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,170
And they were like, like rumbling.

99
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,890
And he was like, he looked at me and he goes, let me spray you again.

100
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:18,790
And he spray, and I don't know if it was my nerves being so scared or if it was the medicine.

101
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,790
But, um, my vision started to go black.

102
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,490
And I was like, doc, doc, I'm really scared.

103
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,090
And he goes, let me spray you again.

104
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,530
I was like, you're looking a little pale.

105
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,210
I was like, doc, I'm dead.

106
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,510
But also, I'm really scared.

107
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,530
I thought I was going to pass out for a second.

108
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,790
Not going to lie.

109
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,930
Like, for real.

110
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,750
The only time, other than that, that has happened to me, I was also in a hospital, actually.

111
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,630
But it wasn't for me.

112
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,750
I was visiting somebody.

113
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:17,750
Um, but I was like, and so I sat there, and he was like, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put this tube.

114
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,930
And I thought it went through my mouth.

115
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,770
Oh, no, sorry, that is, that went through my nostril.

116
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,970
And I just sat there.

117
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,730
I was like, and I closed my eyes the whole time.

118
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,770
But he also was just like, I don't know if I'll be able to show you.

119
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,090
Because the technology here is really old.

120
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,890
And alas, he could not show me.

121
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,930
And I got no pictures or nothing.

122
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,290
I feel, I feel like I got ripped off.

123
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,730
I got scammed, maybe.

124
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,670
Oh, did he find any gold?

125
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,690
I don't think so.

126
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,930
But I have a constant running, runny nose.

127
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,990
Like, lots of ectoplasm in me, I guess.

128
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,830
And, uh, no, I didn't even get a t-shirt.

129
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,870
But it was nice because the medicine that they put in my nose made the running stop.

130
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:27,230
But then, he was like, your, your voice box actually looks so healthy.

131
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,770
And I was like, no way.

132
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,630
And he was like, yeah, I see no, no jewels or anything.

133
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,870
Nothing to be concerned about.

134
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,490
And I was like, no way.

135
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,330
No way.

136
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,830
So, yeah.

137
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,430
In the end, it was all good news.

138
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,810
I still will rest for a little bit while longer.

139
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,570
I might cut it a bit short, depending.

140
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,250
But, um, yeah.

141
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,090
Yeah, I got the doc's approval.

142
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,610
He did give me, like, a paper that said, here are my recommended things.

143
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,270
And it was, it was like, don't yell.

144
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,770
I can't help, but I get too excited.

145
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,610
The rest has been doing good.

146
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,850
Yeah, honestly.

147
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,730
I was really, really scared at one point.

148
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,670
Because I was like, I didn't feel like it would ever recover.

149
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,930
No karaoke.

150
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,670
It does, it does say on there, don't, don't sing unless you get prior permission from the doctor.

151
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,730
I'm at work.

152
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,590
Good luck with work.

153
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,810
Good luck, good luck.

154
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,850
Thank you so much for the super chat.

155
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,670
Yeah.

156
00:12:50,190 --> 00:13:05,510
So then afterwards, I just kind of sat outside the office for like a good, it was like a good half hour before I felt like I could, oh, before I felt like I could float back to the meded cafe.

157
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,850
Anyway, before I was, it was less wobbly.

158
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,630
Next karaoke stream in the title, doc approved.

159
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,610
Yeah.

160
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,850
Yeah.

161
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,130
Don't sing unless medically necessary.

162
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:29,950
But yeah, so the only thing after is also once the, once the, I'm glad I didn't stream yesterday.

163
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,790
I thought about it.

164
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,010
I was like, maybe I'll stream to get some of these nerves out after too.

165
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:41,530
But, um, oh, I, I, my throat really actually ended up hurting.

166
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,930
I think because, you know, there was a, there was a tube down there.

167
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:54,490
And I also, I also, I guess was so, I had so many nerves that happened.

168
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,890
I was so nervous.

169
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,610
I, I fell asleep at like 7 p.m.

170
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,890
And then I woke up at 1 a.m.

171
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,230
And I was up for like two and a half hours.

172
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,290
And I went back to sleep.

173
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,850
I was like, I was like, I, I exhausted myself.

174
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,070
And now we're here.

175
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,650
Sorry for my long story.

176
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,410
I was in and out so fast though.

177
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,730
I was in.

178
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,370
I actually, I got to the doctor's office.

179
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,330
And they, I sat down and like, maybe a minute later they called me.

180
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,150
And I was like, oh, no, please call somebody else.

181
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,390
I, I, I don't want to be called.

182
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,110
Please.

183
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,550
Give me a second to get my thoughts straight.

184
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,730
And so I was in and the guy sprayed my nose.

185
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,990
And then the doctor came.

186
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,010
And then I was out.

187
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,790
And then I was like, whoa.

188
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,850
Yeah, I was not mentally prepared at all.

189
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,930
I don't even know how I got to the, to the, to the, to the doctor's office.

190
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,850
I missed the turns many times.

191
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,010
I missed several turns.

192
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,050
Because I was so scared.

193
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,650
I was scared.

194
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,230
Yeah.

195
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,510
Oh, fast service.

196
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,070
It was.

197
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,150
Yeah.

198
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,490
And we got good news.

199
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,070
So.

200
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,290
Good news.

201
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,590
Yeah.

202
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,530
She's dead.

203
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,890
I am.

204
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,490
Oh, just thinking about it is making my.

205
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,090
No, making me feel a little woozy again.

206
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,010
Uh, I guess I'm really bad with shots, right?

207
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,310
You would think that as a ghost, I don't have to get shots.

208
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,190
But sometimes I do.

209
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,630
I don't have to get ectoplasm drawn too.

210
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,490
And everything sucks.

211
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:05,470
But I'm very, very, very, very, very, very bad with shots.

212
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,370
And even just the thought of it can make me feel so woozy.

213
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,850
And so I thought, I think maybe I tricked myself into thinking it was like a shot into my nose.

214
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:30,750
If you have runniness from your nose going into your throat, you may need some ex-ex-pec-ex-pec-torrent.

215
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,330
Sounds like a wizard spell.

216
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,390
So, I have that problem too and take those now and then I'll look into it.

217
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,190
Thanks, Joshua.

218
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,830
So proud of you for doing the visit.

219
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,030
Beyond the stress of dog visits in general, there's extra level of fear with people shoving things on your throat.

220
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:47,630
Yeah.

221
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,890
But now I know what to expect, so.

222
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,190
Hmm.

223
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,010
And it wasn't so bad.

224
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,790
I just, you know.

225
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,630
Good.

226
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:58,730
Congrats on the good news.

227
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,330
Thank you.

228
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,890
I have my physical tomorrow.

229
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,570
I always get anxious about that stuff too.

230
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,330
Please wish me luck.

231
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,190
Good luck, Maddie.

232
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,930
You got your vitamins.

233
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,170
And apparently, eat more fiber.

234
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:14,730
Yes.

235
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,730
Lots of people don't eat enough fiber nowadays, I guess.

236
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:20,750
Yeah.

237
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,050
But it happened.

238
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,850
Even though it was yesterday, I could, I still.

239
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:38,530
I'm like, Right now, just talking about it, like, in past tense, like, Oh, yeah, I did it.

240
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,110
It's over.

241
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,950
Oh.

242
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,570
After, after so long of me needing to get it done.

243
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,710
You stole my heart with your ghostly powers.

244
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,730
Willing.

245
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,930
I'll willingly send the soup as thanks for all the fun streams.

246
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:54,830
Thank you, Grizzly.

247
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,930
Thank you.

248
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,150
Congrats on the good news.

249
00:17:59,150 --> 00:17:59,870
Thank you.

250
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,650
Thank you.

251
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:00,930
Thank you.

252
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,490
Thank you.

253
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,710
So happy your throat is doing well.

254
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,670
Thank you.

255
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,770
But next time, somebody needs to join me so I can squeeze their hand.

256
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,170
Okay.

257
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,390
Next time, I need...

258
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:19,770
Oh, gosh.

259
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,870
I'm getting really...

260
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,510
I need to stop talking about it, I think.

261
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,510
Getting still kind of wobbly.

262
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,030
You volunteer?

263
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:30,830
You volunteer?

264
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,950
I volunteer as tribute.

265
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,290
I like the song in this so much.

266
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,690
How it's like jazzy and detective-y.

267
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,470
But it's got that theremin...

268
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,150
There- there- there- there- theremin?

269
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,890
Is that what it's called?

270
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,910
The musical instrument that goes the...

271
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,210
Wooo!

272
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,790
That one.

273
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,310
My hands get sweaty.

274
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,830
My hands get small.

275
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,590
I mean, it's...

276
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,450
It's not sweat.

277
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,750
I'll be tribute.

278
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,870
The noire ambiance.

279
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,890
I get anxious at the dentist.

280
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,990
You know what?

281
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,750
I...

282
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,910
I have never... I...

283
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,670
Well, I wouldn't want to say never, but I don't feel like I get nervous at the dentist.

284
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:18,850
Dope!

285
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:19,970
I've decided.

286
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,870
Next time I go back to Japan...

287
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,830
I'm going to...

288
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,910
Go to...

289
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,810
There's a dentist in Akihabara that's all maids.

290
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,610
And I will go there and get my teeth cleaned.

291
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,690
Wait, wait, wait!

292
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,830
The place is gonna be hella crowded with all of us.

293
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,470
Yeah, right?

294
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,690
Maid dentist.

295
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,590
And I've seen it before in Akihabara, but I never...

296
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,650
Went.

297
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,750
And it's kind of been blowing up a little bit.

298
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,250
Like in...

299
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:52,550
On...

300
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,310
Social media.

301
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:54,830
So...

302
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,060
What do you mean you miss me?

303
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,920
I'm right here!

304
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,240
Hi!

305
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,380
Emotional support wisps.

306
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,240
I need it.

307
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,860
I need it.

308
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,540
Anyway...

309
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,380
Oh yeah, I also...

310
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,280
Sorry, I just...

311
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,100
Cleared my throat.

312
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,140
But I usually mute to clear my throat.

313
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,820
But the doctor yelled at me.

314
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,460
He said, No clearing your throat!

315
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
I got in trouble.

316
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,940
So...

317
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,040
I have to stop doing that.

318
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,620
He hee.

319
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,240
Bye bye.

320
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I can't believe I'm still sleepy though.

321
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,820
I slept for so much.

322
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,260
What are you supposed to do?

323
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,860
I...

324
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,140
I don't actually know.

325
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,200
I don't know.

326
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,380
Ah...

327
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,140
Ah...

328
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,960
I'll go.

329
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,400
Blah blah blah.

330
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
That's what I'll do.

331
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,480
Whoa!

332
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,280
Been a good minute since I made an appearance.

333
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,140
I know!

334
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
Kanye East.

335
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,220
Glad all is well.

336
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm wishing pure positivity and good health.

337
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,600
Should I bring back Minto Healthcare Installments?

338
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,840
No!

339
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,160
But thank you so much for the Akashupa.

340
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,520
Thank you.

341
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,940
Probably drink water.

342
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,980
I have water.

343
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,740
Well, I have tea.

344
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,680
We had several endoscopies and two surgeries.

345
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,420
They're so stressful.

346
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,900
Several?

347
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,820
That sounds so scary.

348
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,280
You're brave.

349
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,180
You're so brave.

350
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,620
63% of Minto's stories involve Minto being terrorized by everyday life.

351
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,380
Well, in my case, it's afterlife.

352
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,820
Which is bad.

353
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,840
But it's funny.

354
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,820
Which is good.

355
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,240
Thanks, Minto.

356
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,860
Thank you.

357
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,860
Thank you, Ezreal.

358
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,740
Anyway.

359
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,260
Shall we start this ghostly glamping adventure?

360
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,080
This is gonna make me wanna go camping, huh?

361
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,040
Would you like dialogue to auto-advance?

362
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,480
Yeah!

363
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,820
Actually, wait.

364
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,000
Story mode.

365
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,090
I can change it, probably.

366
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,790
Life wasn't easy.

367
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,590
I forgot his voice is so...

368
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,570
I was as broke as ever.

369
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,050
It's so deep!

370
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,610
And just when my misery had reached its peak...

371
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,730
Doesn't sound like a duck.

372
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,790
He decided to kick me out of my apartment.

373
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,470
What?!

374
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,810
Thankfully, I had...

375
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,910
found somewhere new to stay.

376
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,650
He's got that bread addiction, right?

377
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:58,770
What?

378
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,830
No, Hannah still hasn't seen my last twelve messages.

379
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:03,870
Not the twelve messages.

380
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,630
She rarely responded to my messages after the divorce.

381
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,150
But this...

382
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,550
was really starting to worry me.

383
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,330
What if she was in danger?

384
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,570
I needed to work out what happened to her.

385
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,670
I think she blocked you, dude.

386
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,850
Deductions are a vital part of a detective's work.

387
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,430
Find clue words by questioning persons and inspecting your surroundings.

388
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,630
Enter clue words into blank spaces to solve deductions.

389
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,050
Old flame.

390
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:43,650
So we know Anna is not replying to my messages because Anna is...

391
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,190
Okay, we gotta find clues.

392
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,890
Anna is in another relationship.

393
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,870
Anna.

394
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,650
The most...

395
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,460
Magnificent swan...

396
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,970
I ever had the lousy luck to fall in love with.

397
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,990
Lousy luck for a duck.

398
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,130
Aiding Mike Tyson's ass!

399
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,370
Thank you.

400
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,610
Thanks for the super chat.

401
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,050
Hey!

402
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,950
I'm not ready to face the world yet.

403
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,190
He's so sad.

404
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,470
Hang in there.

405
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,650
Wait.

406
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,310
Royalty payments.

407
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,790
The only book I managed to finish.

408
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,470
The early bird catches the criminal.

409
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,510
The duck detective story.

410
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,930
Oh!

411
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:31,930
Three schmark.

412
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,730
Last month.

413
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,410
What is three schmark?

414
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,570
Why do I even bother?

415
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,870
Oh!

416
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,610
Like...

417
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,250
Is that money?

418
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,230
He got like three bucks?

419
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,390
The receipt from the post office.

420
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,410
Sienna.

421
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,850
I did send your glove back.

422
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,750
I'm not that irresponsible.

423
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,570
Irresponsible added to clues.

424
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,950
This guy.

425
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,430
Is kinda sad.

426
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,290
I mean he was sad last game too.

427
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,630
Oh!

428
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,170
Look at that!

429
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:00,830
Wee!

430
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,190
Wee!

431
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,450
Oh!

432
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,110
Oh!

433
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:04,890
Oh!

434
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,090
Oh!

435
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:06,650
Oh!

436
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:06,850
Oh!

437
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:08,810
Oh!

438
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,110
Oh!

439
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,210
That's all bread under his pillow!

440
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,670
Oh!

441
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:19,550
Oh!

442
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,190
He's still addicted!

443
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,670
Wait.

444
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,990
He has a roommate in this one...

445
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,650
In this like studio apartment.

446
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,450
Where do they...

447
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:29,670
Oh!

448
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,810
I'm making a mess.

449
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,710
Girl!

450
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,130
Excuse me.

451
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,670
One message from November 9th.

452
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,710
They share a bed.

453
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,490
You still haven't sent back my glove.

454
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,790
Did you think keeping my wardrobe ransom would trap me with you?

455
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,710
We would very much like to not have to think about you and your bread anymore.

456
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,410
Who's we?

457
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,690
No more messages.

458
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,470
Uh oh.

459
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,430
So that's the glove he was talking about.

460
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,030
Use the magnifying glass to find clues and then press E to uncover them.

461
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,370
D.

462
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,330
Oh wait.

463
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,910
Is this their pictures together?

464
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,730
This seems way too intimate.

465
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,230
No.

466
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,490
Look at that.

467
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,270
Their wedding photo.

468
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,450
Happier times.

469
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,770
Sad breakup songs that hit hard.

470
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,070
Not love is fake by sad men.

471
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,630
Oh wait.

472
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,870
June 12th, 2024.

473
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,170
Goose times.

474
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,110
Three teenagers injured when trying to cross sector border?

475
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,030
Is that what this is?

476
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,550
Goose times newspaper.

477
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,070
What else?

478
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:58,490
Oh here.

479
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,750
Court hearing reminder.

480
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,570
Uh oh.

481
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,130
Wait what's the third thing I'm supposed to find though?

482
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,650
It won't let me click on anything else.

483
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,990
Oh here maybe?

484
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,790
Injured.

485
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,410
I should probably delete these photos.

486
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,030
Oh.

487
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,210
I should be able to figure this out now.

488
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,910
Oh.

489
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,050
Oh.

490
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,050
Because...

491
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,910
Anna is...

492
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,710
Injured.

493
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,150
Irresponsible tra...

494
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,710
Oh wait.

495
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,210
Wait.

496
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,410
But it said teenagers.

497
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,150
She trapped?

498
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,770
Because of the glove?

499
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,810
But we sent it back.

500
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,970
She's irresponsible.

501
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,710
I mean though.

502
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,090
Hello.

503
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,610
I'll do the trap.

504
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,010
She feels trapped about the glove.

505
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,230
What?

506
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,250
Wait.

507
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,210
Oh the duck?

508
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,170
Oh we got a new thing.

509
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,870
Irresponsible.

510
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,490
There we go.

511
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,010
Ah.

512
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,230
So that was the issue.

513
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,030
Hmm.

514
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,790
I feel like I've gotten a lot better lately.

515
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,110
She should give me another chance.

516
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,690
You can't force it, Duck Detective.

517
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,330
Oh!

518
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,510
Mr. Duck Detective!

519
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,770
I mean, Eugene.

520
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,770
You're finally up, sleepyhead.

521
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,650
You're rooming with him?

522
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,770
Are you sleeping in your trench coat?

523
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,610
I got you those super comfy pajamas, remember?

524
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,470
He's sleeping in his trench coat.

525
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,810
You should really get dressed.

526
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,150
Sure, sure.

527
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,330
But I just had to come tell you that.

528
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,770
We're going on a surprise trip!

529
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,490
Ooh.

530
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,370
And I bet you can use your deduction powers to figure out where we're going.

531
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,090
Okay.

532
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,630
He giggled.

533
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,650
Wait.

534
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,530
Yeah?

535
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,770
Are those...

536
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,130
bread slices?

537
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,850
Okie dokie!

538
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,890
He doesn't even question.

539
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,670
You know, as long as...

540
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,490
As long as he pays the rent, right?

541
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,130
Frederson.

542
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,190
That was his name!

543
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,730
Frederson.

544
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:25,910
Frederson...

545
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,470
The Duck Detective is...

546
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:27,830
No.

547
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:28,250
No.

548
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,810
I don't think so.

549
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,790
Oh, I wish I could...

550
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,250
I wish I could get rid of it.

551
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:32,810
Okay.

552
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,010
I don't think there was anything here.

553
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,230
We can go outside now.

554
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,730
That's just good roommate etiquette?

555
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,450
Well, it's bad roommate etiquette to...

556
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,430
He really preferred staying isolated in my room.

557
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,690
To bust to his room, you know?

558
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:55,170
Rummaging through Frederson's mountain of clutter was the last thing I wanted to do, but...

559
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,730
It seemed that this was how I was going to spend my Wednesday.

560
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,330
What a...

561
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,230
What a pigsty!

562
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,710
I thought you were a duck and a gator!

563
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,370
Was there a pig living here too?

564
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,330
Gross!

565
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,910
Ow!

566
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,470
Oh, gosh.

567
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,730
He's so clumsy.

568
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,470
Wait.

569
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,250
Do those start moving on their own?

570
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,670
This place really is haunted!

571
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:33,450
This equipment must be worth thousands of Schmark!

572
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,990
He hasn't gone skiing even once.

573
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,610
Hmm.

574
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,430
Skiing.

575
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,230
Okay.

576
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,470
Let's see what we got here.

577
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,910
C-C-C-C-Cutiepie?

578
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,810
Told you this is a work trip, Freddy!

579
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,790
First name.

580
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:54,930
Freddy...

581
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,430
Please, let me bring Eugene.

582
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,470
He seems a bit lonely.

583
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,510
Also, he loves being by the water.

584
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:10,750
Okay, so, Cutie Pie is saying that this is a work trip.

585
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,690
Lost Places number 8, Sunny Lake.

586
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,290
Oh, gosh!

587
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,470
What's so scary?

588
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,230
MooTube!

589
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,550
That's why I catch me streaming on MooTube.

590
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,850
Eerie Expeditions.

591
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,470
Okay, wait, but this is like literally...

592
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,570
Teddy subscribed.

593
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,650
This is literally what I watch.

594
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,630
This is literally the same kind of YouTube I watch.

595
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,630
Oh, boy.

596
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,370
You won't believe what we found in this decrepit sanatorium.

597
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,030
Watch until the end.

598
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,990
It's literally my room.

599
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,110
Don't admit that.

600
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,590
Don't admit that to a maid of all people.

601
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,850
Does Mint have a crippling bread addiction?

602
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,950
Maybe not bread.

603
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,570
How did he manage to find a girlfriend?

604
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,610
They've only been dating for a couple weeks.

605
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,770
I guess there hasn't been enough time for her to find out how awful Frederson is.

606
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,530
I always keep track of names in my notebook.

607
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:29,810
Oh, my God!

608
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,530
Yeah, don't admit that to another woman.

609
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,970
So true, that too.

610
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,210
I don't think you wanna...

611
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:38,890
I don't think...

612
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,670
I think you would scare off...

613
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,670
Anybody you're trying to woo over...

614
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,210
If you tell them how dirty and gross your room is.

615
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,550
It's important to work out a suspect's name to crack the case.

616
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,010
Enter their first and last name into the slots below their portrait in your journal suspect page.

617
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,410
Freddy Frederson.

618
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,850
We know.

619
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:09,670
Hmm...

620
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,470
Oh, I'm such a klutz.

621
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,170
Look at all that salami!

622
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,370
Oh, what's this?

623
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,410
Oh...

624
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,290
I forgot...

625
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,830
I pressed Q instead of E!

626
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,170
He's gotta let it out!

627
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,690
Just scream your heart out!

628
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,190
Scream all your worries!

629
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,110
You know when you just go to the ocean and you...

630
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,610
Honk and quack...

631
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,930
To the...

632
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,630
To the horizon?

633
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,870
His newest hobby is skydiving!

634
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,410
Skydiving!

635
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,530
I don't think his snout would even fit in this helmet!

636
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,970
Wait, so we have skiing and skydiving.

637
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,170
What the heck is happening here?

638
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,190
Oh yeah...

639
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,490
Is this his girlfriend?

640
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,690
Rollercoaster.

641
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,790
Near-death experience.

642
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,610
Quack!

643
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,730
Sunny lakeside!

644
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,270
That's the...

645
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,870
That's the video we just saw, no?

646
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,550
Luxurious glamping.

647
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,770
Oh...

648
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,990
Why would you put this in the frame?

649
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,710
Double chin.

650
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,250
Unflattering angle.

651
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,010
How is that a clue?

652
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,550
Thank you so much for the gift.

653
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,570
Why?

654
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,490
Is that a clue?

655
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,970
Aw, look at his little family.

656
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,730
So cute.

657
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,370
This is diabolical.

658
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,770
Why'd you frame this?

659
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,730
Why is he keeping this awful photo of me?

660
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,870
That's what I'm saying.

661
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,950
I think I got everything.

662
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,790
I like how there's more salami here.

663
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,030
I think I got everything except him.

664
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,190
Have you figured it out yet?

665
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,710
I'm working on it.

666
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,050
What's this?

667
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,690
Last night.

668
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,370
About last night.

669
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,810
Oh, yeah.

670
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,310
I heard some strange noises coming from your room.

671
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,550
It sounded like a whale in pain.

672
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,750
Uh...

673
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,290
Yeah.

674
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,670
That's what it was.

675
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,910
I was, uh...

676
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,110
Watching that new show.

677
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,870
Whale Tail.

678
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,870
Nice.

679
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,690
I thought you were having one of your breakdowns.

680
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:45,910
Oh...

681
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,350
Oh...

682
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,490
Oh!

683
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,910
Have you figured it out yet?

684
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,430
I'm working on it.

685
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:55,890
Photo.

686
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,030
Frederson, you'll have to take down that photo of me.

687
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:00,670
Oh!

688
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,970
Which one?

689
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,690
The one where...

690
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,410
The one where it looks like I have an enormous double chin.

691
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:08,610
Nonsense!

692
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,510
You always look handsome in photos.

693
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,710
You just don't...

694
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,690
I get it.

695
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,810
Like, uh...

696
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,930
People see what they want to see.

697
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,490
But then you see what you see.

698
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,670
And you're just like, uh-uh.

699
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,030
This isn't it.

700
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,490
Let's see.

701
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,350
What we got here?

702
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:24,630
Oh!

703
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,890
That's not...

704
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,510
Questionable style!

705
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,250
See, I was looking at the camera.

706
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:29,830
There we go.

707
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,250
Oh!

708
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,530
Nope.

709
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,510
Hawaiian shirt.

710
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,390
He's got something in his teeth.

711
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,270
In his nose.

712
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,770
He's wearing his glasses.

713
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,330
He's got a big ol' smile.

714
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,570
Insufferable.

715
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,550
So mean.

716
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,290
Like how everyone else sees Minto cute always.

717
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,550
But everybody has a bad angle.

718
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,620
Okie dokie.

719
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,380
Holiday.

720
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,520
Freddy is taking...

721
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,220
The Duck Detective on his trip to go...

722
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,470
Glamping at a...

723
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,040
Tranquil...

724
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,520
Oh, I guess...

725
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
A spooky...

726
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,300
Sanatorium!

727
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,840
I don't think you could say Tranquil.

728
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,260
I need to talk him out of this.

729
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,400
Wait.

730
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,340
How is this a work trip?

731
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,560
Frederson!

732
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,960
Did you solve the...

733
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,640
Case?

734
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,440
I figured out you're dragging me on a camping trip I didn't consent to.

735
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,100
Yes.

736
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,200
It's called glamping.

737
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,660
It's very fancy.

738
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,360
Let's get on the bus then.

739
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,440
What if I don't want to?

740
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,700
I spend enough time with you as it is.

741
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,220
Duck Detective, I...

742
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,540
I already paid for everything.

743
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,620
That money is a bit tight right now since...

744
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,220
Since?

745
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,260
You know, you're three months behind on rent.

746
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:06,280
What?

747
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,720
He doesn't pay rent.

748
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,100
Hmm.

749
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,740
Okay.

750
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,640
Okay.

751
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll go.

752
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,860
Mr. Detective First Name Duck.

753
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,040
The damp air was full of mosquitoes and high expectations.

754
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
I want to read the super chats.

755
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,420
I saw them, you guys.

756
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,580
I came here for Frederson.

757
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,220
Once I get a second, I will.

758
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm staying for myself.

759
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,560
After all...

760
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,420
Maybe I did deserve a vacation.

761
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,480
But I can't pause it.

762
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,180
Can you smell that fresh forest air, Mr. Duck Detective?

763
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,940
Frog man.

764
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,340
Oh, I smell a bus exhaustion fuel.

765
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,220
You know, they're meant to have some sort of celebrity staying here.

766
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,640
Wait, this is such a good voice for us.

767
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,100
A celebrity?

768
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,060
Oh no, Freddy.

769
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,140
Frederson, please.

770
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,160
Freddy Frederson.

771
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,120
I already brought your suitcase to the tent, by the way.

772
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,520
Thank you, bus driver.

773
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,000
Great.

774
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,640
Let's go and find it.

775
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,280
Okay.

776
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,020
Alright.

777
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,860
Mew Sugar Otsu!

778
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,260
Congratulations for the sugar first day at your new job!

779
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,480
Also...

780
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,980
Happy birthday, Vanilla!

781
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,580
Happy birthday!

782
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,560
Thank you.

783
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,460
Thank you so much for the letter, too.

784
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,440
Thank you.

785
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,140
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

786
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,260
You're a baddie from all angles, Minto.

787
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,740
Do I have...

788
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:36,960
Do I have...

789
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
I think I have a good side.

790
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,360
I think I...

791
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,230
I can't tell which side I like more.

792
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,830
I think...

793
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,410
I think...

794
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:52,910
I think this side.

795
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,890
Because you can see my big ol' cheek.

796
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,650
You know?

797
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,890
Did someone say...

798
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,330
Minto cute?

799
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,370
No!

800
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,810
Nice cheeks, Minky.

801
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,150
Nice.

802
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,770
You're talking about my face, right?

803
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,930
What is Freddy mumbling to himself?

804
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:21,970
Oh!

805
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,850
He's following me!

806
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,530
Oh, gosh.

807
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,970
This game is so ASMR.

808
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,150
You hear it?

809
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,090
Oh, it sounds so good.

810
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,350
Sonny Lake.

811
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:38,070
Number one haunted camping site, according to TripAlpaca.

812
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,470
You can't trust the reviews on that site.

813
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,310
Haunted...

814
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,530
This guy, I like his voice.

815
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,030
Is, uh, it still camping if you're staying in a cabin?

816
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,150
Oh, we're in a cabin?

817
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,150
Fancy.

818
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,150
Clumsy duck detective.

819
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,690
Have you noticed my new shirt?

820
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,410
I have.

821
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,170
Yes.

822
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,390
Frog has a point.

823
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,050
Do you like it?

824
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,990
Guys, should we be nice to Freddy?

825
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,390
Or...

826
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,770
What do you say?

827
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,030
You guys like his new shirt?

828
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,050
His Hawaiian shirt?

829
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,610
Um...

830
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,490
Yes.

831
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,530
The...

832
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,530
The colors...

833
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,310
Complement you?

834
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,590
Really?

835
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,470
You always know what to say, Mr. Duck Detective!

836
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:34,930
Aww...

837
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,710
Why is he such a...

838
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,810
He's such a...

839
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,070
A grumbler.

840
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,350
He shoots.

841
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,510
He scores!

842
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,290
Wait, you have something else to say to me?

843
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,070
This is so great, isn't it?

844
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,950
A holiday with you and me.

845
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,250
And your girlfriend.

846
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,510
Oh, right.

847
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,650
Right.

848
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,430
Wait.

849
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,170
Wait.

850
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,930
He doesn't get scared again.

851
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,830
That is so funny.

852
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,770
We spooked him.

853
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,130
Okay.

854
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,490
Into sunny lakeside.

855
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,170
Oh, my God.

856
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,170
I'm a reasonable rodent, but three camping chairs and a table stolen just like that?

857
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,810
My client is threatening to leave if you don't fix that broken toilet!

858
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,890
Good Lord.

859
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,270
But I'm telling you, this place is haunted.

860
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,510
The ghost is moving things around all the time.

861
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,830
That's the whole premise of Sunny Lake.

862
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:50,710
Ridiculous.

863
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,290
I don't think Duck's caught on yet that the girlfriend's the actual third wheel.

864
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,330
A theft.

865
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,830
That was definitely something I had to investigate.

866
00:42:59,130 --> 00:42:59,590
A case.

867
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,730
I also wondered what Fredderson's partner was like.

868
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:03,450
Oh.

869
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,990
Who would date him voluntarily?

870
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,290
I needed to find out who she was.

871
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,690
Lots of people have different tastes.

872
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,130
Oh, hey.

873
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,670
Let me introduce you to my girlfriend.

874
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:15,330
No.

875
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,070
I mean, no.

876
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,350
Not necessary.

877
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,230
But didn't you just say that you wanted to meet her?

878
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,710
Work out her identity.

879
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:23,830
Myself.

880
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:24,370
Oh.

881
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,690
Of course!

882
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:26,790
Exciting!

883
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,730
Oh, he wants to figure it out himself.

884
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,430
So-and-so is the blank of the campsite.

885
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,170
So-and-so is a blank of the military.

886
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,950
So-and-so is blank's assistant.

887
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,670
What about girlfriend?

888
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,830
What about Freddy's girlfriend?

889
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,490
June 7th.

890
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,270
Six nights.

891
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:52,530
Eisenman.

892
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,370
Okay.

893
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,170
Well, wasn't he just talking about how he wanted to meet her?

894
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,970
And then he's like, no!

895
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,230
June 8th.

896
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:02,850
Five nights.

897
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,010
Reh.

898
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,250
Reh Redact.

899
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:09,770
Stumperton.

900
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,050
Frederson and McQuacklin!

901
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,610
That's us!

902
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,710
Wait, where's the girlfriend?

903
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,240
Hmm.

904
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,800
This looks like it'll come in handy.

905
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,160
I should question these people about their stay at the camp.

906
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,720
Hmm.

907
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,400
Booking list.

908
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,500
Get her!

909
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,420
Okay.

910
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,300
Clumsy duck detective at it again.

911
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,520
He even chuckles after.

912
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,480
So cute.

913
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:48,660
Oh.

914
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,140
Let's see what we got here.

915
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,980
Someone's diary.

916
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,640
Ooh!

917
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,220
Are we the girlfriend?

918
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,940
It almost sounded like it was screaming in response to that.

919
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,980
The girlfriend exists, right?

920
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,660
Right?

921
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,540
The girlfriend is real and not just one of those apps that like...

922
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,400
You talk to and...

923
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,880
There's like a...

924
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,460
AI girlfriend that talks back to you.

925
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:24,900
Love Plus.

926
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,800
Guest...

927
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,760
July...

928
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,700
2002.

929
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,060
Two years ago.

930
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:41,320
Food is substandard and the weather is horrible.

931
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,230
Sorry for yawning.

932
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,670
I don't know why I yawn so much all the time.

933
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,030
I'm hoping this will be improved next time.

934
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,270
Colonel...

935
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,770
Oh!

936
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:56,890
It's the Eisen...

937
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:58,310
Eisenman guy.

938
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:58,490
Why?

939
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,570
I want...

940
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:02,990
A s...

941
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,210
A s...

942
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:04,930
Toby.

943
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,430
I thought it was gonna say, I wanna go home.

944
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,350
Wait, what else did we miss?

945
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:14,450
Oh.

946
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:15,390
Colonel?

947
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,110
Oh, he's Colonel.

948
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,890
You're his girlfriend waifu.

949
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,010
He's a member of yours.

950
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,630
Oh.

951
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,690
Freddie!

952
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,530
Some people will try their hardest to find something to complain about.

953
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,190
Uh oh, that's a lot of mail.

954
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,450
Someone hasn't checked the mailbox in ages.

955
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,010
It says...

956
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,030
Dinkle.

957
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,950
Dinkle!

958
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,030
Alright, so maybe...

959
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,350
Oh no, we can't...

960
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:46,830
We can't change...

961
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,850
We can't add Colonel Eisenman yet.

962
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:51,350
Hello!

963
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,750
Hello!

964
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,050
Dinkle book.

965
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:58,810
Hi, Piminto!

966
00:46:59,130 --> 00:46:59,510
Yay!

967
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,830
Tonight, I will recount the tragic tale.

968
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,490
Of the haunted sanatorium...

969
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,070
For all of you.

970
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,170
So...

971
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,350
Please, don't miss it.

972
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,110
Exciting.

973
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,070
Okay.

974
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,930
Let's...

975
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:17,470
Let's see.

976
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,030
Let's search her up and down.

977
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,010
Oh god, she's tired.

978
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:22,050
Oh no, she's sweaty.

979
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:23,150
She's nervous.

980
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,590
She's sweating.

981
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,390
Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff.

982
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,410
Stop!

983
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,790
This is a sniff-spection.

984
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,030
Everybody!

985
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,430
Arms up!

986
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,180
Oh!

987
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,240
Once more for good measure.

988
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,650
Yup!

989
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,110
I'm noting down your stink.

990
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,590
Thank you for participating.

991
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,130
You're free to go.

992
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,610
You are free to go.

993
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,970
She's got a watch.

994
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:11,570
A bracelet.

995
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,250
Evil, evil eye.

996
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,450
She's got...

997
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,750
What is that?

998
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,950
Ripped tight.

999
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:20,970
I just...

1000
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:21,950
I wouldn't say neglectful.

1001
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:22,870
Okay.

1002
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:23,410
Gosh.

1003
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,470
A little harsh there, Mr. Detective.

1004
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,450
Interrogate about this.

1005
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,270
Anything you can tell me about Sunny Lake campsite.

1006
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,130
Usually the campsite is mostly empty, but this week, I got six bookings at once?

1007
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:38,950
This...

1008
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,650
This...

1009
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,810
Influencer is already paying off.

1010
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,750
See, Amelia?

1011
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:45,830
You're not a failure after all.

1012
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,670
Her name's Amelia.

1013
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:50,910
I see.

1014
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,030
Thank you, Amelia.

1015
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,470
Can we go in here?

1016
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:54,830
Stop!

1017
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,710
That area is not for guests.

1018
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:58,770
Oops.

1019
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,490
Oops.

1020
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:03,650
Oops.

1021
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:05,890
Amelia.

1022
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:10,010
Maybe we don't know the last name yet.

1023
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,350
I think I've...

1024
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,630
Oh, I'm walking through the pond.

1025
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,910
I'm causing...

1026
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,190
I'm really just...

1027
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,690
Causing a lot of...

1028
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,930
Commotion here.

1029
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,630
I think we can go this way.

1030
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,670
Amelia ReZero.

1031
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:27,510
Sorry.

1032
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,950
I love Amelia.

1033
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,130
Oh my gosh.

1034
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,530
They're trying to boil somebody alive in there.

1035
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:33,630
Did you see that?

1036
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:35,570
A rising tension.

1037
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,650
Mired the cool evening breeze.

1038
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,210
I may be here for a while yet.

1039
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:48,250
At least I had my emergency bread stash waiting for me in my trench coat.

1040
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,270
He's addicted...

1041
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,330
To the wheat.

1042
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,890
Tricky deductions might require new perspectives.

1043
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,870
Press H to get additional guidance at any time.

1044
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,790
You can check the map in your book to see if you've missed any clues in the world.

1045
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:12,930
If you want to look at a piece of evidence again, you can quickly access and enlarge it with the evidence tab of your book.

1046
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,730
The hint button.

1047
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,050
Oh!

1048
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,300
Look at that!

1049
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,540
That thing is going crazy!

1050
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,480
Is that a...

1051
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,400
Jacuzzi?

1052
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,240
Oh!

1053
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,980
I have a crippling red addiction.

1054
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,640
I didn't break my swimming shorts.

1055
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,540
I prefer...

1056
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,880
I prefer rice.

1057
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,520
Hmm.

1058
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,740
It's locked.

1059
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,060
This one's unit number one.

1060
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,260
Like I know hot tubs like, you know, they're...

1061
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,260
They're hot.

1062
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,060
But I don't think they're supposed to boil you.

1063
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,900
I think they're just supposed to...

1064
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,500
You know...

1065
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,900
They're supposed to bubble.

1066
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,680
Hold on.

1067
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,340
I want to go look at number four.

1068
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,520
Oh, here we go.

1069
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,160
I didn't realize it was on a platform.

1070
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,200
How cool is this tent?

1071
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,260
Now we can finally have some one-on-one time together.

1072
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,400
We live together.

1073
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,900
I see you every single day.

1074
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,280
I know, I know.

1075
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,720
But this time we can have pillow talk.

1076
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,260
Talk about all the deep stuff.

1077
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,480
Like...

1078
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,860
Why you never take off your hat?

1079
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,360
It's a part of him.

1080
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,560
I'm not ready to talk about that.

1081
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,000
It's...

1082
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,560
It's his signature hat.

1083
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,220
Wait...

1084
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,500
Isn't pillow talk...

1085
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,920
What we got in here?

1086
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,740
For Katya.

1087
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,020
Plushie.

1088
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,180
Ooh...

1089
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,280
It's like...

1090
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,200
Not Pikachu.

1091
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,960
Baboon's Bribery.

1092
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,320
Detective Novel.

1093
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,320
The early bird catches the criminal.

1094
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,380
Oh, he's got his book!

1095
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,070
Oh, that's him asleep.

1096
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,370
And...

1097
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,510
Freddy taking a picture.

1098
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,410
I don't think he's safe there.

1099
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:24,490
You took my book with you?

1100
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:25,670
Always!

1101
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,830
You've read it five times already.

1102
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,250
And...

1103
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,570
I discover new things every time.

1104
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,140
Hmm...

1105
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,720
Hmm...

1106
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,120
It says...

1107
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,280
Unit number two.

1108
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,620
It's locked.

1109
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,200
Oh my gosh, we're gonna snoop through someone else's stuff?

1110
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,700
First name...

1111
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,380
Toby!

1112
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,140
It's Toby and...

1113
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,100
What is that?

1114
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,900
Braces cleaning kit!

1115
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,540
Okay, anybody with braces we know is Toby.

1116
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,500
If found, return to Matilda Eisenman.

1117
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,020
Never mind.

1118
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,240
Maybe...

1119
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,200
This is...

1120
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,360
This has gotta be Toby.

1121
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:09,960
Wait!

1122
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,640
People with braces can't have gum?

1123
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,560
Magicorn Adventures.

1124
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,760
Ooh...

1125
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,800
Mouch mania.

1126
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,140
They...

1127
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,940
They got a big old chomp into that...

1128
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,900
To that gum.

1129
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,500
That takes me back to when I had braces as a kid.

1130
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,800
It's not Pikachu.

1131
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,160
It's...

1132
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,420
It's a bouch.

1133
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:42,940
It's a mouch.

1134
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,460
It's a mouch.

1135
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,960
Okay, let's go talk to the people now.

1136
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,440
Hello.

1137
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,260
The manager at this campsite is a disaster.

1138
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,260
Should I call the plumber myself?

1139
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,180
What's happening?

1140
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,020
That will take forever.

1141
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,220
Arno won't be happy at all.

1142
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,460
Arno... Huh?

1143
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,900
Stop staring at me!

1144
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,000
I need to concentrate.

1145
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,140
Arnode?

1146
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,360
Is that what she said?

1147
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,060
Let's investigate your...

1148
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,800
Oh, gosh.

1149
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,900
She angry.

1150
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,540
Intense expression.

1151
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,820
We're investigating your body.

1152
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,820
Give me one moment.

1153
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,720
Ooh, the hand on the hips.

1154
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,340
What's that?

1155
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,180
A bruise!

1156
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,820
Interesting.

1157
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,430
What's on your little toesies?

1158
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:35,610
What'd I miss?

1159
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,090
What'd I miss?

1160
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,610
I like how the nose is...

1161
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,730
It's so freaky looking.

1162
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,350
Oh?

1163
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,310
What did I miss?

1164
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,630
Something in your pocket?

1165
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:52,610
No?

1166
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,010
Your toesies?

1167
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,030
Is that...

1168
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,470
Yeah, RTX on meme.

1169
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:01,890
Horns unusual.

1170
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,110
Why is that unusual?

1171
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,830
Can I ask why you chose to come to this camping site?

1172
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:12,510
I'm here for work.

1173
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,670
This isn't the kind of place I come to by choice.

1174
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,250
Wait, work?

1175
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,590
Is this who I think it is?

1176
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,110
But he would recognize her, no?

1177
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,530
He would be like, that's my girl.

1178
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,810
That's who I...

1179
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,330
I'm in trouble with.

1180
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,310
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

1181
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:40,170
They have this sketchy capybara staying here.

1182
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,150
Probably jobless from the looks of it.

1183
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:47,290
I complain to the management, but they don't seem to care at all!

1184
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,510
What if something happens to my son?

1185
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,150
He's too juvenile.

1186
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,150
He wouldn't stand a chance.

1187
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,630
What's with this capybara slander?

1188
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,010
Capybaras are so chill.

1189
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,650
What are you even?

1190
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,750
I can't even tell what animal you are.

1191
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:04,650
A beaver?

1192
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,790
A wombat?

1193
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,410
What the hell are you?

1194
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,290
Hands behind, back, upside.

1195
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,850
He's got no tail if he's a beaver.

1196
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,570
Thick boots prepared.

1197
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,290
Whistle bossy.

1198
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,310
A gopher?

1199
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,810
Then he would have a whistle in his teeth.

1200
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:30,250
I can't believe someone took my camping equipment!

1201
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,390
Oh wait, there's...

1202
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,350
What do you make of this campsite?

1203
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,610
This place has really gone down the drain in the past years.

1204
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,310
So many animals that are just generic...

1205
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,430
At least this year, we don't have to book the caravan anymore.

1206
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,410
Thanks to my promotion!

1207
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,270
Your promotion?

1208
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:47,710
Oh!

1209
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,490
Are you the colonel?

1210
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,170
Let's go this way first.

1211
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,110
I shouldn't wander off just yet.

1212
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:54,710
Just kidding.

1213
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,810
I need to find out which one is Frederson's girlfriend.

1214
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:58,490
Oh!

1215
00:56:58,810 --> 00:56:59,770
I think we found her!

1216
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:00,330
No?

1217
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:06,890
Uh...

1218
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,530
Katya?

1219
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,490
I don't know the last name though.

1220
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,650
And then this might be...

1221
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,190
Wait...

1222
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:13,610
Wait...

1223
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:14,190
Uh...

1224
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,150
Isaman, maybe?

1225
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,530
Capybaras are deceptively bloodthirsty.

1226
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,530
A capybara killed my father!

1227
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,930
Your father...

1228
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,410
Your father...

1229
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:28,730
Probably...

1230
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,170
Um...

1231
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,430
Was soaking in an onsen.

1232
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,570
Eh...

1233
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,410
Is there anything else around here?

1234
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,070
Maybe I can go to this side?

1235
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:44,770
Maybe I can go to this side?

1236
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:45,930
I shouldn't wander off...

1237
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,050
I need to find out...

1238
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,330
Frederson's girlfriend...

1239
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:49,490
Okay, hold on.

1240
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,190
Today's like the worst day to be sleepy about...

1241
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,130
With this kind of game, you know?

1242
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:01,350
Um...

1243
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:01,970
What was the list?

1244
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,210
So either Stumperton...

1245
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,570
Fenton spent the morning in the yard...

1246
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:21,910
Eggie!

1247
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:22,450
What happened?

1248
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,030
I hope you're okay!

1249
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:27,890
What the heck?

1250
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,190
Not the concussion!

1251
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,390
I think I'm gonna make you have...

1252
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,450
Beaver dreams!

1253
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,030
Yeah, the jazzy tunes are so chill!

1254
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:40,830
You're right!

1255
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,410
You're right!

1256
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,200
Okay, Matilda Eisenman...

1257
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,130
So this guy is probably...

1258
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,290
Uh...

1259
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:51,270
Arnod Eisenman...

1260
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,810
Wrong!

1261
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:54,770
Toby?

1262
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,590
No, I was gonna say no.

1263
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:00,910
Wait, are you...

1264
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:01,430
Matilda?

1265
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,360
My...

1266
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,180
My bad.

1267
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,860
My bad, Colonel.

1268
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,860
So...

1269
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,960
What was the...

1270
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,760
What was the list?

1271
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,520
There's Stumperton and...

1272
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,240
Reh!

1273
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:28,760
Reh!

1274
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:31,700
Rehren...

1275
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,060
The name cuts off!

1276
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,740
Thanks for the...

1277
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,900
Thanks for the gifted!

1278
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,000
Is it Reh?

1279
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:39,800
Yes.

1280
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Do we need to get Amelia yet?

1281
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,400
Well, I don't think...

1282
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,620
I mean, I think Amelia works here...

1283
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,040
So she wouldn't sign the guest log, no?

1284
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,630
What's this?

1285
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:52,990
Oh!

1286
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,250
What do you think of...

1287
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:55,970
Katya Rey?

1288
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:57,250
Katya Rey!

1289
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,630
She acts so important!

1290
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,370
I'm not even sure what she does, really!

1291
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:03,850
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,060
What do you think of...

1293
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:12,140
What do you think of...

1294
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,380
Matilda Eisenman?

1295
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,200
She's crazy!

1296
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,540
She has those terrifying eyes!

1297
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,480
Keeps ranting about her new rank, or whatever...

1298
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,500
No, but aren't you, like, girlfriend?

1299
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,240
I don't have to be her son.

1300
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,860
I don't have to be her son.

1301
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,220
Hold on, maybe we can...

1302
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:27,560
No?

1303
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,860
It's all blanked out.

1304
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:29,100
Wait.

1305
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,840
Do I have to get Amelia...

1306
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,140
Oh, wait.

1307
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,940
Do I have to do Amelia?

1308
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,480
Oh, the Dinkle.

1309
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,160
There we go.

1310
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:39,600
Wait.

1311
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,560
Do you need to...

1312
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:40,880
Do I...

1313
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,100
No?

1314
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,100
Oh, you!

1315
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,200
Anything you can tell me about...

1316
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,900
Amelia Dinkle?

1317
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,880
I know she tries, but...

1318
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,760
She's terrible at her job!

1319
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,600
Reh is German for dear?

1320
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,140
No way!

1321
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:59,020
She's been going off the rails with her healing crystals and whatnot.

1322
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,060
They're not exactly bringing her luck, are they?

1323
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,030
Okay.

1324
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,310
Well, I figured out the girlfriend.

1325
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:12,390
Oh, wait.

1326
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:13,330
There's some stuff here.

1327
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:15,790
I missed it.

1328
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,150
Survival Handbook 3rd Edition.

1329
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,750
Tips from Lieutenant Lemmy.

1330
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,670
Rank Lieutenant.

1331
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:30,350
You can use thick prescription glasses to create a fire!

1332
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,150
Thanks, Lieutenant.

1333
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,150
Tips from Colonel Grant.

1334
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:40,890
Colonel...

1335
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:44,850
Make a tea out of pine needles for a source of vitamin C.

1336
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:47,930
Hey!

1337
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:48,590
Is that good?

1338
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,250
Is that real?

1339
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:51,290
Is that real?

1340
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:51,970
Tips from...

1341
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,190
Brigadier Wilmer.

1342
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,490
Brigadier?

1343
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,330
Brigadier?

1344
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:00,130
He looks the exact same.

1345
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,470
On and off.

1346
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:03,110
Never drink your pee.

1347
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,220
Hey.

1348
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,120
Can I call you Wilmer?

1349
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,060
Can I call you Wilmer?

1350
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,820
Desperate times.

1351
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,800
Call for desperate.

1352
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,080
Tell that to...

1353
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,120
Mr...

1354
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,080
What's his name?

1355
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:20,900
Bear...

1356
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,040
The guy.

1357
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,580
That guy that drank his pee.

1358
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,980
Infamous for it, even.

1359
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:30,820
Bear...

1360
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:31,860
Gorillis.

1361
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,420
Was he wrong?

1362
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,300
Are you really not supposed to drink your pee?

1363
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:35,660
Oh, no!

1364
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:36,860
What?

1365
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,440
You're not supposed to drink your pee?

1366
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,740
I'm not even going to ask.

1367
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,080
Oh...

1368
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:47,660
Fr...

1369
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,460
Freddy?

1370
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,560
Freddy?

1371
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,740
I mean, like, you're not supposed to probably, but like...

1372
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,720
If you...

1373
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,760
Are so desperate for hydration?

1374
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:06,840
There's not much you can do, no!

1375
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,060
What can you tell me about...

1376
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,200
Katya Ray?

1377
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,200
She and the person she's sharing the tent with are very...

1378
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,680
Secretive.

1379
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,080
She's been asking me to provide security.

1380
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,060
W...

1381
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,440
What does that even mean?

1382
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,360
Not even then?

1383
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,460
Much like alcohol, it only makes you thirstier.

1384
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,340
Oh, so it's like the...

1385
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,100
Seawater.

1386
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,660
The saltwater...

1387
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:34,400
Like...

1388
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,060
Conundrum.

1389
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,160
Where you drink the saltwater and you're like...

1390
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,800
Oh my god, I'm more thirsty than not!

1391
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,200
I see...

1392
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,620
But what if your mouth is just really dry?

1393
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,100
Snaps, thank you so much for the pig!

1394
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:52,980
Thank you!

1395
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:53,920
Can I leave now?

1396
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,840
I shouldn't wander off.

1397
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,940
I need to find out.

1398
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
Wait, how am I...

1399
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,160
Wait, maybe talk to Freddy.

1400
01:03:58,960 --> 01:03:59,260
No?

1401
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,360
Am I missing something?

1402
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:01,860
Oh, here.

1403
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,640
I just noticed the...

1404
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,240
This is open.

1405
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,140
Never mind, it's locked.

1406
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,460
This one is...

1407
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,520
Unit number three.

1408
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,040
And we looked at that one.

1409
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,280
Oh.

1410
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:19,980
Ah!

1411
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:20,960
Okay, okay.

1412
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,780
So, we have...

1413
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,320
What's her name?

1414
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:23,920
Amelia?

1415
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,660
Amelia Dingle...

1416
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:26,840
Wait.

1417
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,660
Is the...

1418
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,440
Manager...

1419
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,280
Potentially.

1420
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,280
I think Katya is the...

1421
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,480
Influencer's assistant.

1422
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,580
And then Matilda...

1423
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,680
Is a colonel.

1424
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:45,540
No!

1425
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,580
Not a colonel!

1426
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,080
Even higher than the colonel!

1427
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:56,680
Oh, because...

1428
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,420
Yes!

1429
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,580
She was the colonel!

1430
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,080
And then she got the promotion.

1431
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:00,900
That's right.

1432
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,940
Did any of them look like a chair thief though?

1433
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:03,680
Yeah, yeah.

1434
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,480
She had the promotion.

1435
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:05,920
Anyway.

1436
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,900
Now I should get back to deducing the identity of Fredderson's girlfriend.

1437
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,180
Yes, yes.

1438
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,400
The girlfriend.

1439
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,720
Katya is Freddy's girlfriend because her...

1440
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,240
Name is on a plushie he bought.

1441
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,140
Easy peasy.

1442
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,880
Katya the deer is Fredderson's girlfriend.

1443
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,960
How did that happen?

1444
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,860
So judgmental!

1445
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,840
So...

1446
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,440
You're the mysterious girlfriend.

1447
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,660
He figured it out all by himself, Katya!

1448
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,080
And...

1449
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,860
You are?

1450
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,700
The one and only...

1451
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,100
Duck Detective!

1452
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,880
Is it one of those, like, opposite attracts?

1453
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,440
You're the guy that keeps ordering cheese toasties from Freddy's account.

1454
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,140
But I...

1455
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,360
You told her!

1456
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,380
We're boyfriend and girlfriend, of course we tell each other everything.

1457
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,740
Oh my god.

1458
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:00,240
Katya!

1459
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,460
There you are!

1460
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,080
The water...

1461
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,480
Is...

1462
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:03,820
Gold!

1463
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,180
How am I meant to keep up my skin routine with this ice-cold water?

1464
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,800
I was just talking to you!

1465
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,180
I was just talking to you!

1466
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:11,940
I don't want to hear it!

1467
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:12,900
Fix it!

1468
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:13,560
Now!

1469
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,060
Oh!

1470
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,140
Oh, it's blue!

1471
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:17,960
Oh no!

1472
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,040
Oh no!

1473
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:22,320
Hooray!

1474
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,020
Hooray!

1475
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,460
Hooray!

1476
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,400
Hooray!

1477
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,100
Hooray!

1478
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,560
That's why I think they're opposite the track, no?

1479
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,120
Very important question, Minto.

1480
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,580
Have you seen K-Pop Demon Hunters?

1481
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,800
I have not yet!

1482
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,420
But I know the one song.

1483
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,300
Because I hear it everywhere.

1484
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,500
The golden song.

1485
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,440
Actually, I've heard a couple of the songs.

1486
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,460
I...

1487
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:07,040
I don't like how the guys look in the... in the... in the movie.

1488
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,520
Yeah, Soda Pop.

1489
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,980
That's the one that... I don't like the way the guys look.

1490
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,200
They look...

1491
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,300
They look kind of freaky.

1492
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,020
Why is their head so big?

1493
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,900
It feels like Code Lyoko.

1494
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,480
I don't like it.

1495
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,460
The guys are kind of meant to be parodies.

1496
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,500
Oh, really?

1497
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,700
But there's the one song, Golden.

1498
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,980
I really like that one.

1499
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,340
This is ours.

1500
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,540
We get the shabby one.

1501
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:13,840
Right?

1502
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,060
Yeah.

1503
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,560
So, but is this Freddy or Duck Det...

1504
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,760
I guess it's under Freddy's...

1505
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,800
Oh, Freddy and Duck Detective.

1506
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,220
What the...

1507
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:22,660
Okay.

1508
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,200
Um...

1509
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,800
This one is...

1510
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,060
Number three.

1511
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,180
I don't...

1512
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,140
Well, they said she's really secretive.

1513
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,680
But she is staying with someone.

1514
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,540
So that would be Katya.

1515
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,300
And then here...

1516
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,160
Is, I guess, Toby.

1517
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,360
Toby.

1518
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,780
We don't have Toby.

1519
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,320
And then...

1520
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,340
Have I seen this other one?

1521
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,380
No.

1522
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,680
And then more suspects.

1523
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,300
Let's say...

1524
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:09,820
Oh, okay.

1525
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,460
We don't know anybody else yet.

1526
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,020
So...

1527
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,200
We gotta go and talk to some people.

1528
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:16,840
We gotta go.

1529
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,920
We gotta investigate.

1530
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:20,840
This one.

1531
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,600
Why isn't Freddy staying with his girlfriend?

1532
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,640
I think cause she's staying with this guy, no?

1533
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:27,960
The influencer?

1534
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,000
Right outside the party.

1535
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,380
Okay.

1536
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,160
Let's investigate you.

1537
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,160
Oh.

1538
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,540
Perfect skin.

1539
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,620
Vein?

1540
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,480
Asari has good genetics.

1541
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,340
Oh my god.

1542
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,040
I don't know if that's Vein.

1543
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,780
A chess fan.

1544
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,480
Fancy watch.

1545
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,760
Okay.

1546
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,900
Everything else looks the same.

1547
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:10,500
Okay.

1548
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,080
Yeah, we already deduced that.

1549
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,820
Oh, he's a streamer!

1550
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,200
Uh oh.

1551
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,300
Oh, he's a streamer.

1552
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,600
What can you tell me about Amelia Dinkle?

1553
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,820
She gets it all wrong.

1554
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:39,880
All of it, I'm telling you.

1555
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:41,080
Jacuzzi?

1556
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:41,960
Too hot.

1557
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:42,700
Bed.

1558
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,960
Too soft.

1559
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,060
Well...

1560
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:46,740
The toilet.

1561
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,720
Unusable.

1562
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,480
Actually, I think this guy is in the fancy one with the jacuzzi then, no?

1563
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,020
Why did you decide to come here?

1564
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,260
Someone is very nosy.

1565
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,640
Are you from the press?

1566
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,700
The press.

1567
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:01,680
No!

1568
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,000
I'm the duck detective!

1569
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,420
Never heard of it.

1570
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,120
Duh!

1571
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,160
I'm the duck detective!

1572
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:08,780
Yeah!

1573
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,060
Like, isn't it...

1574
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:11,120
Oh!

1575
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,460
Mr. Duck Detective, I...

1576
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,960
I know it's none of my business, but...

1577
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,420
Back at home, you keep getting those government letters.

1578
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,180
Tons of them!

1579
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,440
And they look pretty scary!

1580
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,080
Eh...

1581
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,220
Not now, Freddy!

1582
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,140
I'm on the toilet!

1583
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,180
Freddy goes straight into the trash.

1584
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:40,860
Mr. Detective, I'm starting to learn why your girlfriend has left you.

1585
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,220
This toilet is making weird noises.

1586
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,140
Tax evasion?

1587
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,300
Sounds like it's broken.

1588
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,980
Broken toilet added to clues.

1589
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:51,240
Um...

1590
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,160
Mr. Duck Detective?

1591
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,680
Where did you put your suitcase?

1592
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,600
I didn't bring one.

1593
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,020
You're not gonna change clothes for two days?

1594
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:01,760
Hmph.

1595
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,540
Should be fine.

1596
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,020
How is it that...

1597
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:05,980
Freddy makes...

1598
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,620
Duck Detective look normal?

1599
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,840
Or, I mean, the opposite.

1600
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,800
How is it that Duck Detective makes Freddy look normal?

1601
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,440
Huh?

1602
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:18,840
Stop coming!

1603
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,280
Let me take a souvenir photo of us!

1604
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,080
You already took one on the bus.

1605
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,600
Oh, don't be silly!

1606
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,260
We should take one here as well!

1607
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:28,440
I really don't.

1608
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,300
Cheese!

1609
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,220
Cheese!

1610
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:34,200
Wow!

1611
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:37,380
What a smoldering look, Mr. Duck Detective!

1612
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,540
This one's going on the fridge!

1613
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,160
Wait, can I make a smoldering look?

1614
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,780
Smoldering is not sm...

1615
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,540
It's like a...

1616
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,030
Like that?

1617
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,260
Was that smoldering?

1618
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,320
Why am I hard-boiled?

1619
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,230
The camera loves you!

1620
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:33,950
Give me more!

1621
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:36,570
Wait, hold on.

1622
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,290
I'm gonna look it up.

1623
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:38,650
What's a smoldering look?

1624
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:47,800
In...

1625
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,120
Okay.

1626
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,360
This is what Google says.

1627
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:55,480
A smoldering look generally refers to a sexy, intense, and sometimes mysterious gaze.

1628
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:59,000
Often implying a hidden passion or desire.

1629
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1630
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,770
Like Eugene from...

1631
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,300
From Tangled.

1632
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,210
I feel like I'm just angry.

1633
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,410
Maybe like that.

1634
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:22,430
Maybe like that.

1635
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,690
Okay.

1636
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,610
I'm done being sexy.

1637
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:36,970
Oh, what's this?

1638
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,110
Ooh!

1639
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:41,710
Symbols are cryptic.

1640
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,850
La-la-land.

1641
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,210
A password.

1642
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,140
Okay, let's see.

1643
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,040
That's a...

1644
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,860
That's a wheel.

1645
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,640
Wait, how do I...

1646
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,680
I can't...

1647
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,460
I won't let me...

1648
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,820
I won't let me change it.

1649
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,420
That's key.

1650
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:10,740
And that's a squiggle.

1651
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,860
So none of those are L.

1652
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,440
L, L, L.

1653
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,180
I wonder what that means.

1654
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,080
That's just your life, Dr. Detective.

1655
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,200
Not a single W inside.

1656
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,200
Is Minto recreating the scene from Jumanji?

1657
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,500
Wait, I don't know it.

1658
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,500
His building looks way older than the rest.

1659
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,720
The door is locked.

1660
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,300
Mm-hmm.

1661
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,580
Oh, these are showers, right?

1662
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:40,580
Oh.

1663
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,780
Oh, they connect.

1664
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,520
Wow.

1665
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,180
Sexy.

1666
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,100
Did I get everything over here?

1667
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:50,620
I think so.

1668
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,000
I meant hello.

1669
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:57,120
Group showers.

1670
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,560
Yeah, I remember...

1671
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,660
I remember summer camp.

1672
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:05,840
Listen, it wasn't that many cheese toasties.

1673
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,420
All right, all right.

1674
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,460
There's a scene where someone gets peed on.

1675
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,100
Really?

1676
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,720
I mean, they've already talked about pee.

1677
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:20,620
I guess we'll see.

1678
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,220
The capybara!

1679
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:28,000
Is that Toby right there?

1680
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:34,000
The pale moon's reflection shimmered seductively from the glassy surface of the lake.

1681
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,480
There was more to this campsite than met the eye.

1682
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,760
And I had to dredge up the murky truth.

1683
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:42,880
Dredge.

1684
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,440
Can I

1685
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,160
go down the slide?

1686
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,220
Whee!

1687
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,760
Wait, it's so sexy here.

1688
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,200
Ugh, this is so calming, isn't it?

1689
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,120
Yeah, just like Shrek.

1690
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,780
Make all your worries just fly away.

1691
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,160
Yeah.

1692
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,980
Frederson, those court letters that I've been receiving, they're not a big deal.

1693
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,120
Are they?

1694
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:23,280
Duck detective, you need to respond to them!

1695
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,760
I did a hoogle search and...

1696
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,380
Not hoogle!

1697
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,140
It said you could go to jail for that.

1698
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,040
He'll lose his detectiving license.

1699
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,280
You'll never detective again in this town!

1700
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:35,360
Or ever.

1701
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,480
Ooh, that's a knife.

1702
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,740
Someone's been doing some wood carving.

1703
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,020
The whittling knife has an engraving.

1704
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,700
It says...

1705
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,480
Theodore.

1706
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:44,940
Theodore.

1707
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,100
Are all the chipmunks here?

1708
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,720
That old building is a tourist attraction?

1709
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:55,820
That's spooky.

1710
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,440
It's pretty famous.

1711
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:03,060
I've watched so many mootubers break in at night and explore it.

1712
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,960
It looks very spooky and dangerous.

1713
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:06,520
Yeah.

1714
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,480
One time, a floorboard broke, and one of them broke their ankles.

1715
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:15,410
Exciting.

1716
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,730
I love a good...

1717
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,950
You know, fear.

1718
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,110
A badge.

1719
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:22,570
Military.

1720
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:27,190
A lock.

1721
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:28,550
Combination lock.

1722
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:29,470
Inaccessible.

1723
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:32,630
Heart.

1724
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:33,890
Password hint.

1725
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:34,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1726
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,630
I noticed that, too.

1727
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:38,610
That the heart is also the same, where the heart had...

1728
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,390
Or the LLL had a heart, too.

1729
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:41,590
Hmm.

1730
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:44,130
That heart seems out of place.

1731
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:47,030
I don't think I can crack this just yet.

1732
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:47,950
Hmm.

1733
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:50,330
Hello, kid.

1734
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:53,370
Do you want to see my magicorn cards?

1735
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:53,890
Do you want to see my magicorn cards?

1736
01:18:53,890 --> 01:18:57,690
I have this super strong combo for harmadillo.

1737
01:18:58,590 --> 01:18:59,070
Wow!

1738
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:01,630
This card instantly shuffles in a chomp?

1739
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:03,930
That's so OP!

1740
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:09,130
Redesen, we have more important things to do.

1741
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:11,530
Why does it sound so perfect as a little kid?

1742
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,130
Right?

1743
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:13,990
Like, my goodness.

1744
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,450
You want to see my magicorn cards?

1745
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:21,210
Oh, goodness gracious.

1746
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:23,670
Braces.

1747
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:24,650
Crooked teeth.

1748
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:27,510
Oh, God.

1749
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,890
He's got just the tiniest little...

1750
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,210
Fashion attempt.

1751
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:33,430
Tiniest strand of hair ever.

1752
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,130
Orthopedic shoes.

1753
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:40,450
Misaligned feet.

1754
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,710
Toby!

1755
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:44,410
Oh, Toby.

1756
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:45,530
Oh, goodness.

1757
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,170
Toby looks way cuter without the magnifying glass.

1758
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:54,850
Do you have any information about Matilda Eisenman?

1759
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:00,270
She says we have to go fishing, but...

1760
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,610
I really don't want to.

1761
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:05,650
Where did this accent come from?

1762
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:10,270
She says we have to go fishing.

1763
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,250
Are you enjoying your trip?

1764
01:20:12,770 --> 01:20:15,430
Mom takes me here every year.

1765
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,530
It's so boring.

1766
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,990
I'd much rather go to my friend's place.

1767
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,430
Okay, Peppa.

1768
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,150
Get out of here.

1769
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,530
All right, mysterious capybara.

1770
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,470
Look how similar these berries are.

1771
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:34,810
Which of these three do you think are edible?

1772
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:36,930
I really don't care.

1773
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:39,530
Master Detective Minky on the case.

1774
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, wait.

1775
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,770
This one.

1776
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:45,470
Wrong-o.

1777
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:48,330
No, all of them are poisonous.

1778
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,110
Oh, dang.

1779
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:53,490
In the post-apocalypse, you would have died a horrible, slow death.

1780
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:54,970
Does this kid have three different beings?

1781
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,770
Oh, no.

1782
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:59,030
They like switched up on him.

1783
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:01,450
What kind of character they want him to be.

1784
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:04,250
All right, capybara.

1785
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,530
Whoa.

1786
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:07,510
He's got some intense eyes.

1787
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,370
Gray beard.

1788
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,810
He's old!

1789
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:13,170
Some people gray faster than others.

1790
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:17,810
Stra- Stra- He just...

1791
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:18,310
He's...

1792
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,990
He's...

1793
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,210
A growing boy!

1794
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:30,610
Do you have any information about Matilda Eisenman?

1795
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:34,610
She can be charming if she wants to be, but...

1796
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:38,490
She has a bit of a...

1797
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:39,510
An unhealthy attitude.

1798
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:42,470
She's the one that called you creepy.

1799
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:45,530
What do you make of Emilia Dinkle?

1800
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,250
Oh, she's lovely, isn't she?

1801
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:50,490
I don't know much about her, but...

1802
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:51,710
She seems like a...

1803
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:53,610
A genuine soul.

1804
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:54,890
Genuine soul.

1805
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:59,230
Haven't been able to catch as many streams lately, but I hope you're staying very hydrated.

1806
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,610
I haven't.

1807
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:04,130
In fact, I'm going to sip to that.

1808
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:04,930
Thank you!

1809
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:07,290
Oh, you changed your hat.

1810
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,720
You changed your hat.

1811
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,800
Thank you.

1812
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:25,240
Thank you so much!

1813
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,280
Thanks for dropping by!

1814
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,240
Why have you decided to come here?

1815
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,240
Oh, uh...

1816
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,160
Just, uh...

1817
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,760
Traveling.

1818
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:37,220
Enjoying some me-time in between jobs.

1819
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,560
But there's this one guy.

1820
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,400
Benoit was his name.

1821
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,460
He's really getting on my nerves.

1822
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,820
He yelled at me to hurry up when I was on the toilet!

1823
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,760
Only for him to squat there for 20 minutes!

1824
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:51,780
Rude!

1825
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,200
Alright, what do we got going on here?

1826
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,640
Is this Benoit?

1827
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:57,960
Oh, we don't know yet.

1828
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,740
We know, though, that this is stinking Toby.

1829
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,260
Toby Eisenman!

1830
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,880
Is this Theodore?

1831
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,480
Benoit!

1832
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,000
Okay, oh, what else can we do?

1833
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,360
Arnaud?

1834
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,780
Wait, who is this again?

1835
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,180
Oh, I got it!

1836
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,300
But I don't remember.

1837
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,680
Someone mentioned it and I don't remember why.

1838
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,640
More suspects.

1839
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,080
Okay, Toby...

1840
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,840
Is the child of...

1841
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:47,940
Uh...

1842
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,340
Gosh, there's so many names already.

1843
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:51,840
Matilda.

1844
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,120
Yeah.

1845
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,380
Blank has no friends.

1846
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,440
The duck detective has no friends.

1847
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:10,860
Tomorrow have a work trip.

1848
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,420
Wish me good luck, boss.

1849
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,480
Tuxedo cat!

1850
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,120
Good luck!

1851
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,720
It's a blank...

1852
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,140
Wait...

1853
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,840
Oh, it's a blank influencer!

1854
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:23,080
Um...

1855
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,080
Travel influencer?

1856
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:24,740
Oh, no.

1857
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,920
Chess influencer, maybe.

1858
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,280
Oh, what's your name?

1859
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:28,960
Arnaud?

1860
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,740
He has Freddy.

1861
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,080
Oh wait, but then Arnaud is gonna be...

1862
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:38,520
The...

1863
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:40,060
VIP guest.

1864
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:40,660
Okay, wait.

1865
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,320
So now I need to figure this out.

1866
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:46,880
Um...

1867
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:51,450
He has Freddy.

1868
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,890
He shouldn't.

1869
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:54,910
Freddy's too good for him, honestly.

1870
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:00,510
Um...

1871
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,710
Trying to work backwards.

1872
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,290
No knife?

1873
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,310
No magicorn?

1874
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:10,940
No job?

1875
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:20,350
Matilda accused Theodore of being jobless.

1876
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:20,990
That's true.

1877
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,690
That is true.

1878
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,270
Oh my gosh!

1879
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:25,970
That really was the case.

1880
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:30,030
Of course, it's that pompous guy who gets the VIP tent.

1881
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:31,210
What did you expect of you?

1882
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,330
What even is a chess influencer?

1883
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,210
He can...

1884
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,350
He can...

1885
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,910
Checkmate real good.

1886
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:45,830
I don't know how to play chess, but I watch some chess influencers.

1887
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,370
Actually, sometimes.

1888
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,230
There's one girl, she's a model.

1889
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,530
And she plays chess.

1890
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:54,450
And isn't that just so hot?

1891
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:56,370
Arnaud?

1892
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:00,150
I don't think Katya's staying with him.

1893
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:00,490
No!

1894
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:01,990
Katya's in here, right?

1895
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,450
And then this is...

1896
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:06,570
Toby...

1897
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,310
And Matilda.

1898
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,250
Wait, chess...

1899
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,210
Chess influencers are real?

1900
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,550
Yeah, they're like chess masters.

1901
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,190
And me!

1902
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:32,650
The duck detective!

1903
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,510
I'm also staying here.

1904
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:38,430
Um...

1905
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:38,910
Okay, hold on.

1906
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,790
Who did we not assign?

1907
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:43,710
You think Theodore's with him?

1908
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:45,230
No, there's no way.

1909
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,830
Unless...

1910
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,810
Katya was just hanging out here.

1911
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,650
It could be that she...

1912
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:52,850
Okay, hold on.

1913
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,330
Dandan, welcome to membership.

1914
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:02,950
Thank you!

1915
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:06,410
Ooh!

1916
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:09,030
What is your relationship with Arnaud Benoit?

1917
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,750
Arnaud Benoit, Ben...

1918
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,710
He's an incredibly difficult client.

1919
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:16,410
Taking him to his tournaments is fine, but...

1920
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,280
Going on holiday is a nightmare.

1921
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:23,810
Yesterday, he wanted me to add rose syrup to his rose shampoo.

1922
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:24,370
Ew!

1923
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:27,180
So he can have more rose per rose.

1924
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:28,170
Ew!

1925
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,850
He drives me absolutely insane!

1926
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:33,230
Ugh...

1927
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:33,750
He...

1928
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:34,690
He's me well, though.

1929
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,510
Okay, what about Theodore?

1930
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:39,230
How do you feel about...

1931
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:40,950
Theodore Stumperton?

1932
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:41,850
Stumperton.

1933
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:42,830
He's a strange one.

1934
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:46,350
He arrived here with three rattling suitcases.

1935
01:27:46,730 --> 01:27:48,910
But what does he need all that stuff for?

1936
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,370
Hmm...

1937
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:55,030
Three rattling suitcases, huh?

1938
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:57,870
I think I saw, too, that...

1939
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:02,730
That, uh...

1940
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:05,030
This kid had something lit up.

1941
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:05,410
Yeah.

1942
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,180
Can you tell me anything about Arnaud Benoit?

1943
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:12,850
Arnaud Benoit?

1944
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,130
What?

1945
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:17,110
He always talks to himself, but never with anyone.

1946
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:20,650
That seems very lonely, doesn't it?

1947
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:23,210
What?

1948
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:24,690
What is your accent, kid?

1949
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:27,190
What do you know about Theodore Stumperton?

1950
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:29,790
The Uncle Capybara is so fun!

1951
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:33,830
He's the only one that plays Magikorn with me!

1952
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:41,990
Is it because he's a streamer?

1953
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:43,910
He only knows how to talk to chat, maybe?

1954
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:46,350
Yikes.

1955
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:48,830
What do you think about Toby?

1956
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:49,650
What do you think about Toby?

1957
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:52,530
What can you tell me about Toby Eisenman?

1958
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:54,410
He seems like an alright kid.

1959
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:59,390
I'm not sure what that magical corn is all about, but...

1960
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,550
We all had our fixations as kids, right?

1961
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,290
Totally.

1962
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:06,010
Magical corn.

1963
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:06,830
Let's go.

1964
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,860
I can't figure out who's in this one, then, if it's not her.

1965
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,180
Hmm.

1966
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,030
This one is you...

1967
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,980
You know, unless it's...

1968
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:21,800
Unless it's...

1969
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,360
What's his name?

1970
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,600
So if it's, uh...

1971
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,780
But, wait, then I...

1972
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,400
Wait, but I got this one right, no?

1973
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,460
Oh wait, just kidding.

1974
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,890
Uh, so it's Theodore...

1975
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,900
And then it would be Katya.

1976
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,320
Okay, there we go.

1977
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,480
That's where people were staying.

1978
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,720
Having this untangled will help the future.

1979
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,260
Why is she in his yard, then, huh?

1980
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:45,080
I-I-Excuse me!

1981
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:47,500
Can I please have attention?

1982
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,040
Y-Y-Your attention, I mean.

1983
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,260
It's time for the ghost tour.

1984
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:54,860
Yippee!

1985
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,780
Please come to the sanatorium ruins by the lake.

1986
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:58,100
Okay!

1987
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,840
You don't have to, but...

1988
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,340
No, I want to.

1989
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:00,820
Please come.

1990
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,120
Yes.

1991
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,880
Ghost tour, ghost tour.

1992
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,320
What is this nonsense about ghosts?

1993
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,400
But ghosts do exist!

1994
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,280
Mm-hmm.

1995
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:15,960
I've had one who would return my Rubik's Cube any time I lost it, and put it under my bed!

1996
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,120
Ohhhh.

1997
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,300
Freaky.

1998
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:23,400
Mom said I'm not allowed to go on the ghost tour.

1999
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,480
The ghost tour.

2000
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,560
What are you doing here, then?

2001
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,400
Well, she's not here, so...

2002
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:31,640
What is our no doing?

2003
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:32,830
Heh.

2004
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,040
Oh, that's...

2005
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:37,920
Is this all that's coming?

2006
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,280
Not everyone came.

2007
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,980
Th-that's okay.

2008
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,760
No problem at all.

2009
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:44,900
Follow me!

2010
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,140
Yippee!

2011
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:58,400
What you will see in just a moment is the abandoned Sunny Lake Sanatorium for tuberculosis.

2012
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,580
Not the tuberculosis.

2013
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:03,500
Many years ago, a terrible sickness crossed the land.

2014
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:17,500
It was swift and methodical as a saboteur weakening the body and trapping the mind, and spreading with the ease of a smile.

2015
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:19,360
Ohhhh.

2016
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,080
No one left.

2017
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:32,040
The people acted quickly, building facilities and places of remote beauty to store the ill, until they healed and returned to the cities.

2018
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,160
Or worsened.

2019
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,880
And returned to the earth.

2020
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:36,460
Ooh!

2021
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,360
Spooky!

2022
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:41,120
Patient 12 had been a diplomat.

2023
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:46,200
She'd spent her life in glorious motion, surrounded by crowds.

2024
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,140
Oh.

2025
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:53,200
When she caught the disease, they took her to a sanatorium on the edge of a lake.

2026
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:59,960
And isolation in a lonely bed felt like a form of personalized hell.

2027
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:00,820
Ahhhh.

2028
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:03,260
The other patients had feeble routines.

2029
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:07,120
They shuffled to the windows, drank imported teas.

2030
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:12,500
Watched waffles crash and die against the rocks that lined the edge of the lake.

2031
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:16,400
Rocks that reached upwards like grasping hands.

2032
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,220
Ooh.

2033
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:25,580
Patient 12 did nothing but watch the shadows waltz over her bedroom ceiling to mark the passing of each day.

2034
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,460
And miss her son.

2035
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:34,460
And wished that he would come and visit to steal her away from this picturesque, forsaken place.

2036
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:40,800
Early one morning, Patient 12 noticed a new shadow.

2037
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,280
A shadow in the shape of her son.

2038
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,120
Freaky.

2039
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,160
And she knew that he had come to rescue her.

2040
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,220
And she knew it was important to be discreet.

2041
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:54,720
So, quietly, she dressed.

2042
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:55,720
But you have TVs.

2043
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,960
And quietly, she climbed out of the window.

2044
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,860
She's gonna cause the...

2045
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,960
She followed him across the ground.

2046
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,160
She's gonna cause the...

2047
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,480
And over the zombie apocalypse.

2048
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:08,420
And to the cliffs.

2049
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,240
Ma'am, you're not in there for no reason.

2050
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,120
And quietly, she reached for him.

2051
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:17,000
And quietly, she found that he was not there.

2052
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,240
And the rocks that lined the edge of the lake.

2053
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,680
The rocks reached upwards to catch her.

2054
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,480
Like grasping hands.

2055
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,680
Oh my god, that transition.

2056
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,040
And they say that she picked herself up.

2057
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,080
And dusted herself off.

2058
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:35,360
And climbed slowly back to the top of the cliff.

2059
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:35,760
Huh?

2060
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,720
Unaware.

2061
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,400
Oh.

2062
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,940
That she was dead.

2063
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:39,520
She died.

2064
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,900
They say when the fog rolls in, she's there.

2065
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,580
Still searching for her son.

2066
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,200
Aww.

2067
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:51,960
And that if you are a young boy, you may feel a grasping hand.

2068
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,640
Cold against your own.

2069
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,660
And you might feel the tuberculosis.

2070
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:57,140
Quickly.

2071
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,560
Before it wraps itself around your wrist.

2072
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,060
Ooh.

2073
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,540
And doesn't.

2074
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:03,160
Let.

2075
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:04,300
Go.

2076
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,600
Freaky.

2077
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,500
Hmm.

2078
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,560
So, yeah.

2079
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,900
Pretty spooky, right?

2080
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:13,080
Spooky.

2081
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:16,340
Oh, sorry.

2082
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:16,860
I'm hungry.

2083
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,320
What was that?

2084
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,880
I know what that was.

2085
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,560
That was a ghost scream.

2086
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,320
Ah!

2087
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:26,640
Oh, sorry.

2088
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,760
Can we go back now?

2089
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,160
My...

2090
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,120
My tent!

2091
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,380
Katya!

2092
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,520
You won't believe this!

2093
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,180
Uh-oh.

2094
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,640
Someone vandalized my tent!

2095
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,680
Uh-oh!

2096
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,000
You don't have anything under control, do you?

2097
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:46,760
Damn!

2098
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,340
You've been specifically asked for more security.

2099
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:50,880
Th-that's...

2100
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,780
I...

2101
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,420
G-ghost activity is beyond my control!

2102
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,960
We won't be coming back!

2103
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,040
That's for sure!

2104
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:58,700
That's for sure!

2105
01:34:58,740 --> 01:34:58,820
Ooh!

2106
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:00,940
Um...

2107
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,860
I would like to file a complaint with your manager.

2108
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:04,660
I needed to investigate the VIP tent!

2109
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:08,560
How...

2110
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,180
Did they interview her after this?

2111
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:10,820
How did they know?

2112
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,740
Seems like all of the witnesses died.

2113
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,440
Right!

2114
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,300
How did they...

2115
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,240
Well, you know, just them ghostly tales and all.

2116
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,620
I will need a vacation after this.

2117
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:21,460
Oh!

2118
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,240
I'll take you somewhere nice.

2119
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:25,400
I...

2120
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:25,560
I...

2121
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,800
Do they like each other?

2122
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:27,400
Or...

2123
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,020
I wonder...

2124
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:32,200
This place is so cool.

2125
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:32,520
To be honest...

2126
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,940
The scariest thing about that ghost story was the tuberculosis.

2127
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,360
Yeah...

2128
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:38,660
Uh...

2129
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:43,580
I heard they sometimes would remove ribs or a whole lung to try to keep people alive!

2130
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:44,880
Ugh!

2131
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,260
Too much information!

2132
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:48,980
It's history, duck detective.

2133
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,280
I can't tell if some of these are...

2134
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,340
I guess that's...

2135
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:55,020
A ghost, huh?

2136
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:55,820
I guess that's orange.

2137
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:59,540
This is why I always say you can never be too prepared.

2138
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,940
I feel like they should've made it red or something.

2139
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:04,300
Like, I can't tell if...

2140
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,420
I can't tell if this is orange, you know?

2141
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,160
Or...

2142
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,820
Of everything else is...

2143
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,660
It's hard to tell.

2144
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,040
It's hard to tell!

2145
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,260
It's hard to tell!

2146
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:23,690
Since Mito likes detective stuff, do you watch detective anime like Conan?

2147
01:36:23,850 --> 01:36:24,070
Yeah!

2148
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,410
I used to be up to date on Conan, actually.

2149
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:31,750
You're a detective!

2150
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:32,970
Right?

2151
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:33,650
Uh-huh.

2152
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:34,810
That's right!

2153
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:35,870
Provet!

2154
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,370
Oh!

2155
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:37,870
Um...

2156
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:39,350
He has a magnifying glass!

2157
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:39,670
Yuck!

2158
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:44,370
Although, you should really get some proper glasses, Mr. Duck Detective!

2159
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:44,650
Oh!

2160
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,760
Your eyesight is terrible!

2161
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:49,710
Those are expensive!

2162
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:52,030
Aww...

2163
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:54,590
He can't afford his glasses!

2164
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,780
All this ruckus!

2165
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,040
I'll bet it's for nothing!

2166
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,340
Why is everyone hanging out in the Capybara's yard?

2167
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,160
I don't understand.

2168
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,050
What can you tell me about Toby Eisenman?

2169
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,800
Ah, he's such a smart young boy, isn't he?

2170
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:15,460
I hope he drops that magician corn obsession soon, though.

2171
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,260
I'm afraid he will become too nerdy.

2172
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:22,520
I think it's very important for parents to guide their children!

2173
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:25,440
I was obsessed with...

2174
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,900
A magic corn equivalent when I was...

2175
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,020
A wee wisp.

2176
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:31,660
And I turned out just fine!

2177
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:37,270
Too nerdy!

2178
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:40,150
Oh!

2179
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:42,390
Take a dip in the jacuzzi!

2180
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:45,310
Oh yeah!

2181
01:37:45,450 --> 01:37:47,810
I feel my organs boiling alive!

2182
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:51,950
I turned out just fine!

2183
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:52,590
Right, guys?

2184
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:54,530
Uh...

2185
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:54,820
Teeheeheehee!

2186
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:08,050
The longer I lived, the more it seemed that life was ultimately just unfair.

2187
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:08,990
Was it vandalized?

2188
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:10,230
Or was it always like this?

2189
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:13,510
Yeah!

2190
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:15,250
Yeah!

2191
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:15,690
There you are!

2192
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,110
You said you're a detective, correct?

2193
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:20,950
Correctamono!

2194
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:23,690
Find out why anyone would do this to me?

2195
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:25,210
I'll do my best!

2196
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,810
I just want to play as he call it the chase!

2197
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:28,690
Me too!

2198
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:31,290
Vandalism!

2199
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:32,450
And the deviant!

2200
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:32,650
And the deviant!

2201
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:34,550
Oh!

2202
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:35,690
Spoilers!

2203
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:36,150
Spoilers!

2204
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:37,010
Spoilers!

2205
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:37,690
Someone decided to...

2206
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:39,650
Bribe...

2207
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:40,850
The blank...

2208
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:41,450
Blank!

2209
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:41,730
Blank!

2210
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:41,950
Blank!

2211
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,950
Blank!

2212
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,330
Wee wee wee!

2213
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:49,370
Wee wee!

2214
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,210
Guys, give me a second!

2215
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:54,590
I think I'm gonna go grab some coffee actually!

2216
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:58,370
My eyes feel so heavy!

2217
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:01,710
Sorry, I feel like I'm so tired lately.

2218
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:04,010
Lemon Hermit, welcome to membership!

2219
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:04,590
Thank you!

2220
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:07,950
I made you an elf deck.

2221
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:11,410
For a Magicorn?

2222
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:12,390
Thank you!

2223
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:17,330
Yeah, I'll be right back!

2224
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:18,670
And I'm gonna grab some more tea too.

2225
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:21,250
I'll be...

2226
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:21,790
One second.

2227
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:23,270
Because I had...

2228
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:23,650
Two feet earlier.

2229
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,650
I just didn't finish it.

2230
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:25,390
So...

2231
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:25,830
Um...

2232
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:26,450
I won't be long.

2233
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:27,350
I'll be right back!

2234
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:21,450
Alrighty!

2235
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:25,310
Okay...

2236
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,010
Okie dokie!

2237
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,170
Okie dokie!

2238
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:29,070
Sorry about that!

2239
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,050
Alright, let's investigate!

2240
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:32,430
We got some contact...

2241
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:33,210
Lenses!

2242
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:34,710
He's got...

2243
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:35,490
No!

2244
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:37,430
He plays Sudoku!

2245
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:40,070
Boring hobby!

2246
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:41,250
So true!

2247
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,290
Welcome back!

2248
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:42,990
Thank you!

2249
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:43,810
What is this?

2250
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:44,330
Foundation?

2251
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:45,490
Makeup?

2252
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:47,330
Fussy?

2253
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:48,130
Is that the...

2254
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,950
Nail gloss?

2255
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:52,330
Waterproof eyeliner?

2256
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:54,350
Foundation?

2257
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:54,810
Foundation?

2258
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:55,870
Lots of...

2259
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:56,930
A lot of foundation.

2260
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,650
Who needs that much makeup?

2261
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,090
Mito favorite gacha game?

2262
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:05,230
Blue Archive!

2263
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:07,470
Except...

2264
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,310
I

2265
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:13,460
don't...

2266
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:13,660
I don't...

2267
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:14,080
Okay...

2268
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:15,220
Ugh...

2269
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,700
Right now they're having...

2270
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:17,740
Blue Archive...

2271
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:18,440
The festival...

2272
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,120
The fest...

2273
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,200
In Blue Archive...

2274
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:20,600
And...

2275
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:22,880
Oh...

2276
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:23,180
It's...

2277
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:23,560
It's...

2278
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:29,440
It's going really bad for me...

2279
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:29,810
It's going really bad for me...

2280
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,540
And I already...

2281
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,340
I already had to...

2282
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,670
I already had bad luck on the last banner...

2283
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,660
With Seiya...

2284
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:41,500
If you play...

2285
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,510
I was able to still get Seiya and Schoolgirl Asana...

2286
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:48,510
But this banner...

2287
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,130
Oh...

2288
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:52,830
It's...

2289
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:55,710
It's...

2290
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:56,210
It's really...

2291
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:57,510
It's really bad...

2292
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:01,290
Oh...

2293
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:01,930
I have...

2294
01:42:01,930 --> 01:42:02,950
Save for...

2295
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:03,450
I can't...

2296
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,550
I have nothing left...

2297
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:06,410
I...

2298
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:07,870
I needed...

2299
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,390
Swimsuit Hanako...

2300
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:11,740
I have not had her this entire time...

2301
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:14,010
And I really...

2302
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:14,610
I was like...

2303
01:42:14,610 --> 01:42:15,410
I need her...

2304
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:15,810
I need her...

2305
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:16,750
I need her...

2306
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:19,830
And...

2307
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:22,090
I'm at...

2308
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,530
I'm at...

2309
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:27,530
I think it was like...

2310
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:29,110
225...

2311
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:29,610
Pulls...

2312
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:33,990
And I have not pulled anybody...

2313
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,610
No Rio...

2314
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,610
No Hanako...

2315
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:40,610
I haven't gotten anyone...

2316
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:42,870
No Nehru...

2317
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:44,110
I haven't gotten anyone...

2318
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:47,750
Yeah...

2319
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:48,950
It's really...

2320
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:49,610
Really bad...

2321
01:42:51,130 --> 01:42:51,990
And I...

2322
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:53,750
I did spend money...

2323
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:54,990
And I still did...

2324
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:55,430
I love...

2325
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:55,890
I mean...

2326
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,450
With 225...

2327
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:58,410
I can spark...

2328
01:42:58,410 --> 01:42:58,930
But...

2329
01:42:59,870 --> 01:43:00,410
I...

2330
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:01,850
I wanted both of them...

2331
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:02,650
And at this point...

2332
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:03,790
I'm not gonna get...

2333
01:43:04,890 --> 01:43:06,870
I'm not gonna get either of them...

2334
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:08,270
Or I'm gonna get only one of them...

2335
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:08,610
I guess...

2336
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:10,850
Uh...

2337
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,370
And it makes me so sad...

2338
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:12,630
Because...

2339
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:15,530
I love Blue Archive...

2340
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:16,450
So much...

2341
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:17,730
But my gacha luck...

2342
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:18,490
Has been so bad...

2343
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:18,950
I'm like...

2344
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:19,070
What?

2345
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:20,870
Do you want me to go to...

2346
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:21,350
Umamusume?

2347
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:22,130
Huh?

2348
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:23,350
Huh?

2349
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,470
I will go to...

2350
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:26,590
Umamusume...

2351
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:29,850
Uh...

2352
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:30,790
The game hates me...

2353
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:33,670
Uh...

2354
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:34,690
And this was...

2355
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:35,850
This all happened today...

2356
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,130
So I was really bummed out...

2357
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:37,630
About it actually...

2358
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:39,650
It really kind of...

2359
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:40,610
It's so sad...

2360
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:41,690
Isn't it kind of pathetic...

2361
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:42,910
For me to be like...

2362
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:44,750
My gacha pulls...

2363
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:46,030
Ruined my day...

2364
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:48,730
But when you spend money...

2365
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:49,370
And you...

2366
01:43:49,370 --> 01:43:50,610
Pull so much...

2367
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:52,310
And you still don't get what you want...

2368
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,670
It's like...

2369
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:54,210
Oh...

2370
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:55,290
It's so bad...

2371
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:55,710
Oh...

2372
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:57,290
It's so bad...

2373
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:00,690
It's a hundred percent...

2374
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:01,170
First world...

2375
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:02,290
World problems...

2376
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:04,290
A hundred percent...

2377
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:07,250
You love blue archive...

2378
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,590
But it isn't loving you back...

2379
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:09,650
It's so one-sided...

2380
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,090
I know...

2381
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:12,290
I wish it would stop being so tsundere for me...

2382
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:14,770
Gacha funds...

2383
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:15,290
Thank you...

2384
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,670
Thank you so much...

2385
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,710
I asked you for gacha luck...

2386
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:22,430
During horse game...

2387
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,630
And I managed to pull saber...

2388
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:24,730
And her light cone...

2389
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:26,810
In Hongkai star whale...

2390
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:28,930
So I'm passing my residual luck...

2391
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:31,730
I don't think I have any gemmies left...

2392
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:34,330
To do another pull...

2393
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:35,690
Unless I spend money...

2394
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:37,110
Which I already spent...

2395
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:40,010
A lot of money...

2396
01:44:40,010 --> 01:44:40,610
Not...

2397
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:42,070
Over a hundred dollars...

2398
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:43,490
But...

2399
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:45,950
Still enough money...

2400
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:49,670
I had in the bottom...

2401
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:50,450
One percent luck...

2402
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:51,110
In ZZZZ...

2403
01:44:51,110 --> 01:44:51,950
Before I quit...

2404
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:55,790
A new banner...

2405
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:56,170
Dropped a new...

2406
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:57,850
And people are suffering...

2407
01:44:57,850 --> 01:44:59,150
I heard about that...

2408
01:44:59,150 --> 01:44:59,950
I heard about that...

2409
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:03,010
Spending money...

2410
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:03,570
To tell you...

2411
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:04,490
It's okay to be sad...

2412
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:05,150
About bad luck...

2413
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:06,610
After spending money...

2414
01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:07,570
Me...

2415
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:09,010
Thank you...

2416
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:14,710
It's rough out there...

2417
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:15,330
Awesome blue...

2418
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:16,010
Thank you...

2419
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:17,770
Awesome suit Hanako fights...

2420
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,170
I am suffering...

2421
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,590
I do gotta play more...

2422
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:27,010
UMA though...

2423
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:29,450
I'm not very good...

2424
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,410
About playing games...

2425
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:31,650
On my PC...

2426
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:32,290
You know...

2427
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:32,910
Or especially...

2428
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:33,410
Gacha games...

2429
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:33,910
On my PC...

2430
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,110
I'm not used to it...

2431
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:36,190
Cause I never did like...

2432
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:37,330
Emulators...

2433
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:38,170
Or anything like that...

2434
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:40,690
I'm too stupid...

2435
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:42,370
I understand...

2436
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:43,430
I've had days like those...

2437
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:45,210
Especially when money is spent...

2438
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:45,810
Yeah...

2439
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:46,970
Do you guys understand...

2440
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:47,930
My pain...

2441
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:50,750
Additional gacha fuzz...

2442
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:51,610
To go with the luck...

2443
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:52,010
No...

2444
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:53,190
Thank you...

2445
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:54,750
I hit hard penny...

2446
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:55,750
Three times in a row...

2447
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:56,570
On FGO...

2448
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:57,370
Before I quit...

2449
01:45:57,370 --> 01:45:58,810
The pain is real...

2450
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:01,770
Yeah...

2451
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:04,210
Oh...

2452
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:05,870
It hurts...

2453
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:07,430
It hurts...

2454
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,810
Gacha hurts...

2455
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:11,290
Gacha hurts...

2456
01:46:11,290 --> 01:46:11,690
I put...

2457
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:12,870
I got two kitas...

2458
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:14,070
And ten pulls...

2459
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,880
That's quite a scarf collection...

2460
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:20,150
Blue...

2461
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:20,670
Striped...

2462
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:21,190
Checkered...

2463
01:46:21,190 --> 01:46:22,810
One for every occasion...

2464
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:24,130
Hmm...

2465
01:46:24,130 --> 01:46:25,270
I like the striped one...

2466
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:26,290
Whoa...

2467
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:26,970
Blue...

2468
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:27,670
Blue...

2469
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:28,150
Clues...

2470
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:29,490
Blue's clues...

2471
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:31,970
Oh...

2472
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,890
I'm gonna snoop on your computer now...

2473
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:35,810
He's on Mootube...

2474
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:37,690
Ten best...

2475
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:37,950
Oh...

2476
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:38,650
I thought it was gonna...

2477
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:39,330
Oh my gosh...

2478
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:39,890
I thought it...

2479
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:42,570
I almost thought it said...

2480
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:44,250
Ten best cheats...

2481
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:45,290
For chess...

2482
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:47,590
King...

2483
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:48,150
Best...

2484
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:49,090
Best...

2485
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:49,890
Chest...

2486
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,290
No...

2487
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:54,890
Best...

2488
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:55,370
Best...

2489
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,450
Chess...

2490
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:57,390
King...

2491
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:58,410
Moments...

2492
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:26,470
He hasn't uploaded it yet...

2493
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:27,910
Queen...

2494
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:31,190
How is my army hero doing today?

2495
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:37,470
I can't wait any longer.

2496
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:39,910
You said you'll send me the photos.

2497
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:45,050
Patience, my queen.

2498
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:48,190
First, you'll need to give me my present.

2499
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:54,710
Hope they release some more Koharu merch for you to make up for the gacha pin.

2500
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:56,490
I hope not!

2501
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:00,430
So, you know what's kind of great?

2502
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:03,230
Chyna loves Koharu.

2503
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:06,150
So they always release really good merch of her.

2504
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:11,290
I feel like he's getting catfished.

2505
01:48:11,470 --> 01:48:11,710
Maybe.

2506
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:16,110
Then you can request any photo...

2507
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:18,750
Any photo of me?

2508
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:19,250
What?

2509
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:21,870
And solitaire!

2510
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:26,130
Don't fund my bad luck, you guys.

2511
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:27,710
Your money is going to nothing.

2512
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,770
Chyna loves who?

2513
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:32,550
Koharu!

2514
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:35,750
My- my best girl in Blue Archive.

2515
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:40,890
Only Chyna Blue Archive releases goods of her.

2516
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:50,290
Your money is wasted because I have too bad of luck and I never pull it!

2517
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:51,790
No!

2518
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:55,960
Are in this chat.

2519
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:56,840
Nothing fun!

2520
01:48:56,860 --> 01:48:59,060
Don't you feel bad snooping around on people's laptops?

2521
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,700
Looking at their... personal information?

2522
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:04,900
They never wanted anyone to see- Oh my gosh, Freddy has sense.

2523
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,960
That's the whole point of being a detective!

2524
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,620
I guess that makes sense too.

2525
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,140
Not a fund.

2526
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:16,160
Thank you, welcome back, Master Paladin!

2527
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,580
Here's number one!

2528
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:22,440
Okay...

2529
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,540
Oh, what's this?

2530
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:26,780
Oh...

2531
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:29,280
The scarf is yellow.

2532
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,540
Frog!

2533
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,680
Our nose...

2534
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:37,440
Morning routine secrets.

2535
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,400
Suggestive look unnerving.

2536
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:45,260
Does he take photos of himself with him wherever he goes?

2537
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:46,140
Wow!

2538
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,040
That's a big trophy!

2539
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,920
He must be super good at chess.

2540
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:55,560
Wouldn't be surprised if he's cheating somehow.

2541
01:49:58,980 --> 01:49:59,740
The...

2542
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:03,540
The vibrator up his butt!

2543
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,450
Jeez!

2544
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,880
You guys ever hear about that?

2545
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,860
You guys ever hear about that?

2546
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,260
You...

2547
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:33,140
Do you...

2548
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:35,080
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2549
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:39,350
There was a guy...

2550
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:40,720
Who got accused.

2551
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,840
He was like a master chess player.

2552
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:44,260
He got accused of cheating.

2553
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:49,740
And it's because they suspect he...

2554
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:51,900
Had something up his...

2555
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:52,640
His...

2556
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,700
His butt!

2557
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:57,520
That was vibrating to tell him...

2558
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,960
What was to do?

2559
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,220
You...

2560
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:11,090
Wow!

2561
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,880
I'd rather spend this on your...

2562
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:17,620
And...

2563
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:18,260
No!

2564
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:19,760
No...

2565
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:19,880
No!

2566
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:23,040
Thank you so much for the pink though.

2567
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:29,680
I got a peeker sticker of vodka from Uma for my car today, so please enjoy gacha funds.

2568
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:33,460
I picked vodka as my fave because of her name, but I genuinely love her now.

2569
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,000
That's wholesome.

2570
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,740
Thank you.

2571
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:39,960
No, don't...

2572
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,720
Good luck with rolling Kita.

2573
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:44,540
I give you my luck, even though I don't have much at all.

2574
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,540
I did hear about the chest butt guy.

2575
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,320
I don't think it was confirmed, just allegations.

2576
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:57,660
But I think it's strong allegations.

2577
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,360
Everybody, look at all this lotion.

2578
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,040
Wait, there's actually...

2579
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,020
Wait, what's this?

2580
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,180
What is this?

2581
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:14,720
Looks like a tiny recording device.

2582
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,560
Do you think someone is listening in on Arnaud?

2583
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:19,560
Arnaud.

2584
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,660
So creepy.

2585
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:21,600
Creepy.

2586
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,220
Maybe.

2587
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,000
Creepy added to the clues.

2588
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:29,280
I see.

2589
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,820
What do you have to say?

2590
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:37,540
If you were a ghost, what kind of ghost would you be?

2591
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,140
Oh, me.

2592
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:39,980
Me, me, me, me.

2593
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:40,760
Pick me, pick me.

2594
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:43,660
I would be a vengeful ghost because that's what I am.

2595
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:47,980
Would be fun to be some sort of horrible, vengeful ghost.

2596
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,820
There are some people that deserve to be haunted.

2597
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,300
I hope you don't mean me.

2598
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,780
Tell the gacha you will delete it.

2599
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:03,740
If you don't pull what you want, trust me, it works.

2600
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:05,220
I should have done that.

2601
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:08,100
I feel the desire meter.

2602
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:10,940
I couldn't hold back, you know?

2603
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:12,940
And so it knew that I wanted...

2604
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:16,280
It knew that I wanted her very strongly.

2605
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,620
We're causing you to bring up your gacha page.

2606
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:25,920
No, it's okay.

2607
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:28,160
I love talking about it.

2608
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:30,980
Damn.

2609
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:32,840
Please forgive me.

2610
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,940
Also, please bless my polls for Hoshino.

2611
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,560
I bless...

2612
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,820
Your polls!

2613
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:40,240
I bless if everybody is polling for something.

2614
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:45,040
Either in Honkai or Umao or Blue Archive.

2615
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:48,060
I bless.

2616
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:59,190
Soon, we will meet.

2617
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,730
For now, I have your scent.

2618
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:03,710
Your queen.

2619
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:08,090
Skate Geek.

2620
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:09,270
Thank you so much for the 10 gift.

2621
01:54:09,270 --> 01:54:09,970
Thank you.

2622
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:12,530
My lucky charm.

2623
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:14,810
What's the scent?

2624
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:17,050
What is it?

2625
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:17,810
What's the scent?

2626
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:18,070
Oh.

2627
01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:20,550
Scratch marks.

2628
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:21,210
Old.

2629
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:25,670
I wonder what this lucky charm is.

2630
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:28,870
There's a lot of lotion, you guys.

2631
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:34,290
I was just kidding about...

2632
01:54:36,430 --> 01:54:38,010
But there's just half...

2633
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:42,070
There's a lot of lotion.

2634
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:46,090
You know, you almost seem happy about the vandalism happening.

2635
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:48,670
We're even knocking it over.

2636
01:54:48,670 --> 01:54:49,230
I'm here to help.

2637
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:53,710
Alright, let's talk to Arnaud.

2638
01:54:53,710 --> 01:54:56,270
It feels so...

2639
01:54:56,270 --> 01:54:56,650
Invasive.

2640
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:57,650
Invasive?

2641
01:54:58,010 --> 01:54:58,910
What if they come back...

2642
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:00,370
And attack me?

2643
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,350
Did they steal anything?

2644
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:03,850
Oh...

2645
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,390
I...

2646
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:05,370
I don't know.

2647
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:07,190
You haven't checked?

2648
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:15,520
You seem to take yourself very seriously.

2649
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,820
But of course...

2650
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:20,180
Treat yourself how you want others to treat you.

2651
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:23,980
How else do you think I take all this prize money on?

2652
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:27,060
Confidence is everything.

2653
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,040
And the clear skin.

2654
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:31,640
And the clear skin.

2655
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:33,940
Don't read my name wrong.

2656
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:35,300
Tom!

2657
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,800
Thank you for the super chat.

2658
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:45,520
I just got Kita-san black after your blessing.

2659
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:46,140
Thanks, Minto.

2660
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:46,900
Happy!

2661
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:48,700
Happy!

2662
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:49,920
Ah, it works every time.

2663
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:53,640
This is a recording device we found in your tent.

2664
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:54,480
Phew!

2665
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:55,540
This is a tent?

2666
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:55,780
What?

2667
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:58,400
What would someone do with recordings of me?

2668
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:00,280
Is this a stalker?

2669
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:02,180
Maybe they want to...

2670
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:03,680
Blackmail you?

2671
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:04,400
Oh!

2672
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:06,340
Oh!

2673
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:09,320
Alright, let's see what we got here.

2674
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:10,580
Vandalism!

2675
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:11,280
Um...

2676
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,960
Someone decided to...

2677
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,300
Maybe...

2678
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:18,540
Blackmail the...

2679
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,440
The...

2680
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:22,700
The creepy...

2681
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,760
The creepy creepy...

2682
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,340
Of creepy...

2683
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:31,260
Wait, what?

2684
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:36,900
Huh?

2685
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:37,040
Huh?

2686
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,080
The sniffing check is real!

2687
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:48,010
Black... They wanted to...

2688
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:49,850
Steal the creepy, creepy...

2689
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:52,970
No, we definitely have all the pieces.

2690
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:54,190
It's 14 out of 14.

2691
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:55,810
But... Okay, hold on.

2692
01:56:57,450 --> 01:56:58,570
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2693
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:00,310
Of...

2694
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:01,950
Arno...

2695
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:03,350
They wanted to...

2696
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,550
Okay,

2697
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:11,410
thank you so much for the dead gifted.

2698
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:12,210
Thank you!

2699
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:13,270
Thank you, thank you.

2700
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:19,610
What is... What are our clues for the...

2701
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:21,170
Like...

2702
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,540
Wait, what was the creepy...

2703
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:29,800
There was something creepy.

2704
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:31,540
What was creepy?

2705
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:33,800
Was it this?

2706
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:35,140
Was this the creepy?

2707
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:36,480
No, this is Lucky.

2708
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,820
What was creepy?

2709
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:40,540
Creepy?

2710
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:42,360
What?

2711
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:45,000
Oh, creepy was the listening device.

2712
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:46,260
Well, they...

2713
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:46,880
Don't wanna...

2714
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,260
They...

2715
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:49,820
I don't think they were going to steal the listening device because...

2716
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:51,400
It was right there in the middle of the floor.

2717
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,580
Does the lotion count?

2718
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:10,140
Do you think it was the...

2719
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,820
Because there's two adjectives here?

2720
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,820
Is it the yellow...

2721
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:16,140
What it...

2722
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:16,600
The...

2723
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:17,420
No...

2724
01:58:17,420 --> 01:58:18,760
It wasn't checkered or anything.

2725
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,200
Or maybe the lucky yellow scarf.

2726
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:23,520
Because the scarf...

2727
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,420
I noticed the...

2728
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,360
The yellow scarf was the only one not there.

2729
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:30,560
The goal wasn't to vandalize, but to steal Arno's lucky scarf.

2730
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:31,300
Yeah, yeah.

2731
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:33,840
I wondered what pushed the person to these legs.

2732
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:35,540
Maybe that's what the scent was.

2733
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:38,420
And then the deviant.

2734
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,400
Lank...

2735
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,840
Arno is getting...

2736
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:47,840
Something via chat messages by...

2737
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:49,540
Lanks.

2738
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,320
Creepy.

2739
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,660
Yeah, he was wearing the yellow scarf...

2740
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:02,720
In the picture.

2741
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:06,520
But it wasn't over here.

2742
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,060
I did notice that earlier.

2743
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:09,880
Look, it's even...

2744
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:10,200
It's supposed...

2745
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,240
I guess it was supposed to be...

2746
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,560
Oh, actually no, I can't tell.

2747
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:16,060
Okay, what?

2748
01:59:21,060 --> 01:59:22,340
When in doubt, creepy.

2749
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:25,980
Creepy...

2750
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:27,160
Stalker.

2751
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:30,100
Wait.

2752
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,100
It's getting...

2753
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:35,940
Blackmailed via chat messages.

2754
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:43,910
Almost everything's wrong.

2755
01:59:57,450 --> 01:59:59,470
It's not a creepy stalker?

2756
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:03,270
It said it's a lucky stalker.

2757
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,060
Maybe...

2758
02:00:09,060 --> 02:00:10,420
Maybe it's Katya.

2759
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:10,760
No?

2760
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:14,260
Because she's the assistant, but clearly not.

2761
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:18,930
Lucky stalker.

2762
02:00:18,930 --> 02:00:19,370
Locker.

2763
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:20,070
Ooh la la.

2764
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:32,780
Um...

2765
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:34,100
Bribed.

2766
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:38,800
With...

2767
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:43,960
Personal...

2768
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,520
Photos?

2769
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,500
Okay, so someone's getting bribed.

2770
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,720
How do we know this though?

2771
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:52,680
I'm just guessing, but how do we know this?

2772
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:56,660
I'm trying to think of where the information is coming from.

2773
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,160
Because we got all the...

2774
02:00:59,100 --> 02:00:59,660
The...

2775
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:00,680
Deductions, but...

2776
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:03,020
Who am I to say...

2777
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:04,080
That it's any of these...

2778
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:11,010
Let's go, Mita!

2779
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:12,110
Thank you!

2780
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:14,870
Lucky stalker.

2781
02:01:14,950 --> 02:01:16,570
Driven to steal lucky scarves.

2782
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:17,650
To help with gacha pulls.

2783
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:20,610
It was on the computer.

2784
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:21,710
The queen.

2785
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:24,090
Oh, that's right!

2786
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:27,350
They were like, how's...

2787
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:29,430
How's my army hero?

2788
02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:30,470
So it's Matilda.

2789
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:32,530
I can't wait any longer.

2790
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:34,750
You said you'll send me the photos!

2791
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:35,250
Okay.

2792
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:36,470
So it's Matilda.

2793
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:40,650
You little freak, Matilda!

2794
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:44,310
Matilda was getting bribed?

2795
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:48,170
I wondered what the present was that they were talking about.

2796
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:49,730
Alright.

2797
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:53,930
It was time to deduce who was behind the theft.

2798
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:57,330
The thief!

2799
02:01:57,950 --> 02:02:01,430
Blank stole Arnod's scarf because he, she, is his...

2800
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:02,770
Stalker.

2801
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:03,110
Oh.

2802
02:02:04,710 --> 02:02:05,870
Maybe it's...

2803
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:06,890
Maybe it's Matilda.

2804
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,810
Because she is his queen!

2805
02:02:10,170 --> 02:02:12,050
It was Matilda who was behind this.

2806
02:02:12,190 --> 02:02:12,570
Fortune!

2807
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:14,650
This was getting quite scandalous.

2808
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:22,150
Every year, Matilda Eisenman and her son Toby go on vacation to Sunny Lake.

2809
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:23,430
What is this Conan music?

2810
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:27,550
This year, Matilda's wildest dreams are coming true.

2811
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:33,810
Arnaud Benoit, a famous chess streamer, is staying at the campsite.

2812
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:38,110
Who Matilda happens to be a huge fan of.

2813
02:02:40,590 --> 02:02:42,830
She started chatting with him online.

2814
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:46,810
And was asked to strike a deal in return for...

2815
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:47,970
Wait, it was actually him?

2816
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:48,270
Oh?

2817
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:49,250
That's crazy.

2818
02:02:50,890 --> 02:02:55,770
Arnaud asked her to stay away from him for discretion, but Matilda grew impatient.

2819
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:06,970
In her desperate state, she broke into the VIP tent and stole Arnaud's lucky scar.

2820
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:09,130
That makes sense, she wasn't there at the ghost store.

2821
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:12,290
Uh, Mr. Duck Detective.

2822
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:16,410
You've been silently staring into the distance for a while now.

2823
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:19,210
No, I'm just...

2824
02:03:19,930 --> 02:03:21,470
Figuring out the case.

2825
02:03:21,650 --> 02:03:22,710
He's such a good detective.

2826
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:24,330
Tell me, tell me!

2827
02:03:26,030 --> 02:03:26,970
Not yet.

2828
02:03:27,310 --> 02:03:29,170
There are still a lot of unknowns.

2829
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:34,270
I'd rather not make my deductions public before I got the whole picture.

2830
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:37,270
But, but I'm your assistant, and then...

2831
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:41,290
We need to find more information on Matilda Eisenman.

2832
02:03:43,150 --> 02:03:44,190
Oh, okay.

2833
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:45,730
He doesn't trust.

2834
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:46,470
He doesn't believe.

2835
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:48,590
He doesn't...

2836
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:50,810
Freddy, shh, Freddy, shh.

2837
02:03:51,670 --> 02:03:52,790
Trust in the system.

2838
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:55,950
I think we've got everything in here.

2839
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:58,790
Yep, okay.

2840
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:00,630
We're good to leave.

2841
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:01,690
Oh, I'm stuck.

2842
02:04:01,870 --> 02:04:02,190
There we go.

2843
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:04,170
Wait.

2844
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:05,510
Where are you going?

2845
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:07,270
You said you would help me.

2846
02:04:07,890 --> 02:04:10,410
Um, and that's what I'll do.

2847
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:11,710
Later.

2848
02:04:12,230 --> 02:04:15,470
After I sorted out some other things.

2849
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:18,290
Useless.

2850
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:21,030
Oh my gosh.

2851
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:23,430
Rude.

2852
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:25,590
I'd rather be useless than rude.

2853
02:04:26,890 --> 02:04:27,650
Wait, what?

2854
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:31,510
We need to find a way to enter Matilda's room.

2855
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:32,290
What did that say about duck divorces?

2856
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:32,830
Sounds fun!

2857
02:04:34,690 --> 02:04:37,050
What did that say about duck divorces now?

2858
02:04:39,230 --> 02:04:39,790
Oh.

2859
02:04:40,210 --> 02:04:41,210
Oh, that scared me too.

2860
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:42,570
Mr. Jack detective.

2861
02:04:43,150 --> 02:04:45,090
Back when you were with the police.

2862
02:04:45,810 --> 02:04:47,590
Uh, your precinct.

2863
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:49,210
Did they think you were cool?

2864
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:53,370
Um, I only really spoke to my partner.

2865
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:53,950
Oh.

2866
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:55,210
I see.

2867
02:04:55,570 --> 02:04:56,250
Oh, whoops.

2868
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:58,330
Didn't mean to close out a bit.

2869
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:03,310
So, this, uh, partner of yours from the precinct.

2870
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:05,910
Do you like them more than me?

2871
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:08,110
No.

2872
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:11,170
I don't even know you're the partner.

2873
02:05:12,710 --> 02:05:13,870
I don't even know.

2874
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:17,050
They mate for life except when they get divorced.

2875
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:18,290
That's what it said.

2876
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:21,150
Oh.

2877
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:26,640
Oh.

2878
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:30,020
I mean, he was a bit boring.

2879
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:30,800
Oh.

2880
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:31,620
Heh.

2881
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:33,860
You're definitely not gonna have a boring moment with me.

2882
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:34,960
So true, Freddy.

2883
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:41,260
Sorry, I wanted to see if there's anything over here, but there seems to be not.

2884
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:43,120
So let's get into Matilda's house.

2885
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:45,920
Breaking and entering.

2886
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,100
This is unit number two.

2887
02:05:49,460 --> 02:05:50,500
How do we get the key?

2888
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:53,420
Didn't we see Matilda's bag somewhere?

2889
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:54,060
The BL root.

2890
02:05:55,300 --> 02:05:56,320
Wait, what'd you say?

2891
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:57,840
This is unit number two.

2892
02:05:57,840 --> 02:05:58,720
We saw a key where?

2893
02:05:58,840 --> 02:05:59,560
How do we get the key?

2894
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,600
Didn't we see Matilda's bag somewhere?

2895
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:05,400
Oh yeah, it was on the, it was on the, the lake.

2896
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:09,880
The stars are truly beautiful out here, aren't they?

2897
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,300
Ah, the sky is beautiful.

2898
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:20,780
It's a bug?

2899
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:22,080
Yeah, to listen in on people.

2900
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:25,000
Ooh, looks like a newer model as well.

2901
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:26,980
How would you know that?

2902
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:29,020
Theodore?

2903
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:35,520
Is the moon a star?

2904
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:48,670
You're the only star in my heart.

2905
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:53,850
Does that answer your question?

2906
02:06:54,230 --> 02:06:55,810
Does that answer some distress in your aura?

2907
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:57,250
That's just you, Amelia.

2908
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:57,770
I'm fine.

2909
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:58,530
Are you, though?

2910
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:06,080
What is Toby Eisenman like?

2911
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:09,840
I try my best for him to have fun here, but...

2912
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,380
I don't think he's having a good time.

2913
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:16,060
He wants to play his little, his uh, Nintendo's.

2914
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:19,180
Do you have any information on Theodore Stumperton?

2915
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,900
Poor soul is going through some...

2916
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:22,980
He's right there!

2917
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:27,120
I should pick up some gemstones for him, to improve his karma!

2918
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,740
He's right there!

2919
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:29,400
He's right there!

2920
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:37,820
Oh my God!

2921
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:39,120
Oh, that guy!

2922
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,200
He's just really going through it!

2923
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,200
Man, his karma is shot!

2924
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,280
Damn, that guy!

2925
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,620
Damn, Amelia!

2926
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:49,460
Have some tact!

2927
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,020
We found this in the VIP tent.

2928
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,900
Do you have an explanation?

2929
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:55,860
Oh, what?

2930
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:58,320
I've never seen that before.

2931
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,500
I don't even know what it is!

2932
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:03,380
Uh, that's very suspicious, Amelia.

2933
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:06,620
Extremely suspicious response now.

2934
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,860
So...

2935
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:10,900
You stopped messaging your ex, right?

2936
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:12,540
Why do you care?

2937
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:14,510
I...

2938
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:17,660
I caved after three days.

2939
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:18,020
Thank you!

2940
02:08:19,010 --> 02:08:20,100
After three days!

2941
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:23,680
Maybe I could, uh, introduce you to some of Katya's friends?

2942
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:25,960
It's too early.

2943
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:27,400
It's been a year!

2944
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:29,380
Nine months.

2945
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:31,820
Uh...

2946
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:32,920
The baby is born.

2947
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:33,300
Think about it.

2948
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:35,740
The baby...

2949
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:37,260
The divorced baby is born.

2950
02:08:37,900 --> 02:08:38,600
You know what?

2951
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:39,700
I just realized...

2952
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:41,940
I was like, Freddy sounds so familiar to me.

2953
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:45,140
And it finally hit me on the head, just now.

2954
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:49,120
Freddy sounds like an old co-worker that I had.

2955
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:50,860
Except...

2956
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:51,960
Like...

2957
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:52,980
If Freddy was a...

2958
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:53,820
Was a lady.

2959
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:55,760
And...

2960
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:57,300
But she sounds exact...

2961
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:58,660
She sounds exactly like Freddy.

2962
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,520
Like when I...

2963
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,500
When I was an office ghost.

2964
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:09,940
Okay.

2965
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:10,120
Okay.

2966
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:11,680
Her bag was on the beach, I remember.

2967
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,440
Oh my gosh.

2968
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:16,500
Now I can't unhear it.

2969
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:18,180
Kind of like...

2970
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:19,960
I heard it immediately when...

2971
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:20,960
He was like...

2972
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,080
When Freddy was like...

2973
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,660
Maybe I should introduce you to some of Katya's friends.

2974
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:27,580
That's...

2975
02:09:31,730 --> 02:09:32,590
Uh oh.

2976
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,030
Why do I have to stay?

2977
02:09:35,390 --> 02:09:38,130
There are no buses or taxis out here at night.

2978
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:39,150
Please.

2979
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:40,590
Get yourself together.

2980
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:41,350
And tomorrow...

2981
02:09:41,790 --> 02:09:42,310
We'll leave.

2982
02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:42,870
Okay?

2983
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:45,350
Fine.

2984
02:09:46,290 --> 02:09:47,790
Just so you're aware...

2985
02:09:47,790 --> 02:09:50,690
I'll probably gain a wrinkle from all this stress.

2986
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:54,450
What the heck?

2987
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:55,830
Who's...

2988
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:58,470
Who's drawing witchcraft in the sand?

2989
02:09:58,470 --> 02:09:59,650
How mysterious.

2990
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:02,750
That seems like a case for...

2991
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:04,810
The investigator!

2992
02:10:06,510 --> 02:10:08,730
How long have you been holding that one back?

2993
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:10,130
Basically since we arrived.

2994
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:12,850
15 months of for Ricky!

2995
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:14,670
Thank you!

2996
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:16,230
Thank you so much, Pedro!

2997
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:17,470
Thank you, thank you!

2998
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:20,610
Wait, we've seen this circle before though.

2999
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:24,190
I fear...

3000
02:10:24,190 --> 02:10:25,450
What's that?

3001
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:28,290
Cloth remains burnt.

3002
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:31,550
Wasn't Theodore wearing a flannel?

3003
02:10:33,270 --> 02:10:34,270
Was that...

3004
02:10:34,270 --> 02:10:35,590
A stick with sand?

3005
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:39,930
Ash.

3006
02:10:42,230 --> 02:10:45,790
You guys, I still think of that one moment in the Pokemon movie.

3007
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:47,030
Where...

3008
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:48,550
What was it, Pokemon 2000?

3009
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:50,210
Where they say...

3010
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:52,450
That the world will turn to ash.

3011
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:55,710
But they mean it in a...

3012
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:57,950
Where they...

3013
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:59,450
They...

3014
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:01,670
Instead of saying the world will turn to...

3015
02:11:02,650 --> 02:11:04,630
Like, get burnt up.

3016
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:06,030
They're like...

3017
02:11:06,030 --> 02:11:07,550
They mean it literally...

3018
02:11:08,810 --> 02:11:11,410
Where they're like, everyone's gonna look at that guy.

3019
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:18,590
I literally...

3020
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:20,390
I think about that all the time.

3021
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:24,470
Not like burn.

3022
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:26,790
Like, literally they will turn to ash Ketchum.

3023
02:11:26,890 --> 02:11:27,150
Yes!

3024
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:33,440
They're like...

3025
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:34,600
They're so upset.

3026
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:36,700
I mean, it's like an old, old prophecy.

3027
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:37,920
They're like, oh my gosh.

3028
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:41,100
If this happens, the world will turn to ash.

3029
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:44,600
They just meant the world's gonna look at this 10 year old.

3030
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:45,580
Like...

3031
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:46,760
What even is this?

3032
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:48,340
It's so...

3033
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:49,800
It's such a good pun though.

3034
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:50,460
It's...

3035
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:50,780
It's so good.

3036
02:11:50,780 --> 02:11:52,180
It's so good.

3037
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:56,300
The localization team cooked with that, honestly.

3038
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:04,540
They cooked with that.

3039
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,840
I can't tell...

3040
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:07,800
Okay, these are orange.

3041
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:08,800
I think these are gray.

3042
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:11,820
Okay.

3043
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,240
Normally, I'd take a bath to distress.

3044
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,560
Okay, my 2,000 was so peak though.

3045
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:15,220
Yeah!

3046
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:17,820
I don't have to go back into that cursed tent.

3047
02:12:18,900 --> 02:12:20,500
That cursed tent.

3048
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:21,500
I can't do with that.

3049
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:23,220
I don't know what Arno is complaining about.

3050
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:26,120
He gained 10,000 followers while we were here.

3051
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:26,440
What?

3052
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:28,060
That's insane!

3053
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:29,780
Because of here?

3054
02:12:30,820 --> 02:12:31,320
Or...

3055
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:33,800
Guys, I'm close to 400k.

3056
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,840
Or...

3057
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:36,100
No.

3058
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:36,500
Wait.

3059
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,260
Uh...

3060
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:39,060
I'm close to 400,000 subscribers.

3061
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:41,100
So, um...

3062
02:12:41,100 --> 02:12:41,660
Help...

3063
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:42,640
Help a ghost out.

3064
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,660
Q.

3065
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,500
Camp!

3066
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:50,900
Wait...

3067
02:12:56,730 --> 02:12:57,370
L...

3068
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:58,170
Wait!

3069
02:12:58,230 --> 02:12:59,870
I remember where we saw the symbol!

3070
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:02,910
I think it was...

3071
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:06,090
On the lock for the...

3072
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:07,530
I think it was here.

3073
02:13:07,710 --> 02:13:07,950
Hold on.

3074
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:08,770
I wanna double check.

3075
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:20,670
Over here?

3076
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:24,370
I think it was...

3077
02:13:25,310 --> 02:13:25,830
Here.

3078
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:30,150
Oh!

3079
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:30,770
It was that!

3080
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:32,030
It was that.

3081
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:32,630
It was this.

3082
02:13:33,290 --> 02:13:34,090
Kinda similar.

3083
02:13:36,970 --> 02:13:37,630
Daima!

3084
02:13:38,050 --> 02:13:39,230
Thank you so much for the brain!

3085
02:13:39,670 --> 02:13:40,150
Hello, hello!

3086
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:43,170
Hello, hello!

3087
02:13:45,190 --> 02:13:46,070
Thank you!

3088
02:13:46,930 --> 02:13:50,330
All the wisps gather to create 15k accounts.

3089
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:54,190
I want to get them.

3090
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:56,150
To the spooky subscriber number.

3091
02:14:00,330 --> 02:14:01,230
Let's see.

3092
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:05,470
Hey!

3093
02:14:05,590 --> 02:14:06,190
I can't see them, dude!

3094
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:07,530
Thank you so much for the gifted!

3095
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:08,310
Endorgo!

3096
02:14:08,410 --> 02:14:09,310
Thank you so much for the vibe!

3097
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:09,730
I'm gifted!

3098
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:10,910
Ducky!

3099
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,730
Thank you for the gifted!

3100
02:14:11,890 --> 02:14:12,650
Thank you guys!

3101
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,370
Thank you!

3102
02:14:15,630 --> 02:14:16,130
Thank you!

3103
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:16,570
Thank you!

3104
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:18,690
Oh!

3105
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:20,090
Oh!

3106
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:21,030
It tells me.

3107
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:23,270
Kill!

3108
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:33,350
Oh!

3109
02:14:33,490 --> 02:14:33,850
Nevermind.

3110
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,410
It can't be kill.

3111
02:14:42,730 --> 02:14:44,390
How am I supposed to figure this out?

3112
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,490
Wait.

3113
02:14:46,790 --> 02:14:47,550
I'm trying to think.

3114
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:51,490
What other...

3115
02:14:51,490 --> 02:14:51,930
King!

3116
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:53,070
It must be King!

3117
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:55,270
She's thinking of her king!

3118
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:01,910
It's Quop!

3119
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:07,530
Thank you so much!

3120
02:15:07,670 --> 02:15:08,410
Welcome to Bamboo Ship!

3121
02:15:08,530 --> 02:15:09,510
I hope I said your name right.

3122
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:10,090
Shopkeeper!

3123
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:11,250
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

3124
02:15:11,490 --> 02:15:12,130
Thank you!

3125
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:15,090
I got an achievement, but I didn't see what it was.

3126
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:15,530
My bad.

3127
02:15:16,290 --> 02:15:16,450
Okay.

3128
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:16,730
Oh.

3129
02:15:16,990 --> 02:15:17,630
Search the bag.

3130
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:20,670
We got her unit key.

3131
02:15:21,630 --> 02:15:22,630
Steal that.

3132
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:25,710
Cod liver oil for kids!

3133
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:27,790
How to raise a warrior.

3134
02:15:28,090 --> 02:15:30,550
A guide for the military mom.

3135
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:32,550
We got...

3136
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,570
We got that.

3137
02:15:35,050 --> 02:15:36,090
The scarf?

3138
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:37,590
Lucky scarf.

3139
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:38,570
Stolen goods!

3140
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:44,750
What do I see here?

3141
02:15:45,050 --> 02:15:45,570
A key!

3142
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:48,710
It must open one of the accommodations here.

3143
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:52,690
Nice.

3144
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:56,390
We're just gonna steal that and not give back the scarf, I guess.

3145
02:16:00,030 --> 02:16:01,830
We're just, uh...

3146
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:04,170
You know, he'll find it on his own if he...

3147
02:16:04,930 --> 02:16:06,550
Really wants it that bad.

3148
02:16:10,090 --> 02:16:11,790
When are we gonna see a ghost?

3149
02:16:15,290 --> 02:16:18,350
The neatly kept cabin promised the ordinary.

3150
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:22,650
But I knew there was dirt amongst this cleanliness.

3151
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:23,930
Ooh.

3152
02:16:25,070 --> 02:16:26,470
There's always dirt.

3153
02:16:27,230 --> 02:16:28,950
My dad used to take me fishing.

3154
02:16:29,570 --> 02:16:32,970
Catching carp was the only way he knew how to bond with me.

3155
02:16:33,290 --> 02:16:33,730
Carp!

3156
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:34,490
Kitties!

3157
02:16:34,650 --> 02:16:35,510
Thank you so much for the fun.

3158
02:16:35,610 --> 02:16:36,470
Thank you!

3159
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:38,750
I'm seeing one right now.

3160
02:16:38,970 --> 02:16:39,350
A dirt?

3161
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:40,990
Are you?

3162
02:16:41,190 --> 02:16:44,370
Why does this card game need over 100 cards?

3163
02:16:44,550 --> 02:16:45,170
At least 100 cards!

3164
02:16:45,170 --> 02:16:47,590
This was designed to drain parents out of their money.

3165
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:48,370
And more to see.

3166
02:16:48,410 --> 02:16:49,090
That's just the base set!

3167
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:52,450
The Omega Booster Packs is where the real fun starts!

3168
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:54,610
Wow.

3169
02:16:57,330 --> 02:17:00,990
Are Pokemon cards still getting scalped up the wazoo?

3170
02:17:02,670 --> 02:17:03,730
At the moment?

3171
02:17:05,870 --> 02:17:07,150
Are they still...

3172
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:08,330
Yeah, they are!

3173
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:11,230
Gosh.

3174
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:13,170
That...

3175
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:15,530
The, uh...

3176
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:16,010
What's it called?

3177
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:17,130
Um...

3178
02:17:17,130 --> 02:17:18,810
What is this thing floating right there?

3179
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:19,570
See that?

3180
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:21,290
Oh!

3181
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:21,970
There we go.

3182
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:24,170
Oh my god!

3183
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:28,170
There's a camera in this plushie!

3184
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:30,810
That's freaky.

3185
02:17:31,410 --> 02:17:31,910
Oh, it's...

3186
02:17:31,910 --> 02:17:33,250
And it's Toby's!

3187
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:36,290
I don't know what's up recently.

3188
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:37,190
I feel like...

3189
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:38,190
The co...

3190
02:17:38,190 --> 02:17:39,460
The quote-unquote collect...

3191
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:42,490
Not collector community, but like...

3192
02:17:42,490 --> 02:17:43,510
There's...

3193
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:46,630
People are going crazy with collecting right now, you know?

3194
02:17:47,370 --> 02:17:50,290
Feels like Beanie Babies all over again, but worse.

3195
02:17:53,070 --> 02:17:54,310
Toby, old.

3196
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:57,630
There is a hidden camera in this plushie?

3197
02:17:57,710 --> 02:17:58,190
That's freaky!

3198
02:17:58,190 --> 02:18:00,630
What a shame to ruin such a cute Goldilocks!

3199
02:18:01,490 --> 02:18:03,030
I should take this with me.

3200
02:18:05,070 --> 02:18:06,650
We're just stealing the plushie.

3201
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:12,650
What is this?

3202
02:18:12,970 --> 02:18:16,810
Oh, I think it's like a little piece of the...

3203
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:18,710
You guys...

3204
02:18:18,710 --> 02:18:19,730
Did you guys see it?

3205
02:18:20,650 --> 02:18:21,650
It was like a...

3206
02:18:21,650 --> 02:18:22,190
I don't...

3207
02:18:22,190 --> 02:18:22,990
I don't know.

3208
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:23,650
It was weird.

3209
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:24,070
Anyway.

3210
02:18:25,790 --> 02:18:26,250
Inga!

3211
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:27,690
Ah...

3212
02:18:28,250 --> 02:18:28,870
Photo...

3213
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:31,190
Military...

3214
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:35,750
Can't believe you had a thing with that guy.

3215
02:18:36,150 --> 02:18:36,630
Eh...

3216
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:38,210
It was a bit of a crazy time.

3217
02:18:38,490 --> 02:18:40,110
He wasn't the only one.

3218
02:18:46,730 --> 02:18:49,170
You gifted 30 subs!

3219
02:18:53,870 --> 02:18:54,550
Confidential...

3220
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:15,910
Confidential...

3221
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:16,410
Confidential...

3222
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:16,670
Confidential...

3223
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:18,590
Information on Project L03...

3224
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:20,310
Is strictly confidential...

3225
02:19:20,310 --> 02:19:21,190
And will be...

3226
02:19:21,190 --> 02:19:24,610
Handed out in person...

3227
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:26,730
Kitchen etiquette reminder...

3228
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:28,270
Unread...

3229
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:28,510
Hello?

3230
02:19:28,810 --> 02:19:29,510
Open the room.

3231
02:19:30,010 --> 02:19:32,070
Confidential secrets...

3232
02:19:32,070 --> 02:19:32,450
Confidential secrets...

3233
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:36,870
Is this L-L-L, maybe?

3234
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:37,970
Maybe, yeah.

3235
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:39,790
Strictly confidential, huh?

3236
02:19:40,710 --> 02:19:41,290
Curious.

3237
02:19:41,550 --> 02:19:42,890
Digital Canary.

3238
02:19:43,310 --> 02:19:46,190
You gifted 20 memberships.

3239
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:48,290
Thank you so much.

3240
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:49,950
You didn't have to do that, but thank you.

3241
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:52,990
Thank you, thank you.

3242
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:57,530
Alright, I think we've explored everything in here.

3243
02:19:58,990 --> 02:20:01,630
Which was pretty crazy.

3244
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:03,750
Jessie!

3245
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:05,650
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

3246
02:20:05,850 --> 02:20:06,390
Thank you!

3247
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:06,810
Wait.

3248
02:20:07,450 --> 02:20:08,830
It's not showing...

3249
02:20:09,610 --> 02:20:10,410
It's completed.

3250
02:20:10,650 --> 02:20:11,250
Maybe it is.

3251
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:11,610
I don't know.

3252
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:16,780
What do you make of this plush?

3253
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:19,000
I clicked the wrong thing, my bad.

3254
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:19,980
This one.

3255
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,880
Have you seen this plushie before?

3256
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,640
Sammy, thank you so much for the five gifted.

3257
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:23,840
Welcome!

3258
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:27,300
I personally don't know much about it, but...

3259
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:31,140
It's from this thing the kids are into nowadays, isn't it?

3260
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:31,920
This thing!

3261
02:20:33,060 --> 02:20:33,520
Hmm...

3262
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,480
Rest in glitch ways, thank you so much for the five gifted!

3263
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:36,500
Thank you!

3264
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:37,940
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3265
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:40,200
Where are they anyway?

3266
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:42,800
Toby and, uh...

3267
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,140
And his mom.

3268
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:53,990
Okay.

3269
02:20:57,850 --> 02:21:00,350
Do you know what this is?

3270
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:02,810
What can you tell me about this plushie?

3271
02:21:03,130 --> 02:21:03,430
Ew!

3272
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:06,410
Take that smelly old thing away from me!

3273
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:08,190
Poor guy.

3274
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:13,830
Can you tell me anything about this plush toy?

3275
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:15,510
Do you think it's cute?

3276
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:17,250
Uh...

3277
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:18,410
Why are you asking me this?

3278
02:21:20,610 --> 02:21:21,170
Well...

3279
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:24,670
Maybe a certain someone will give you a certain present at some point.

3280
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:26,110
Please...

3281
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:27,610
Don't buy me more things.

3282
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:30,090
Sh...

3283
02:21:30,090 --> 02:21:31,090
Does she like him?

3284
02:21:33,010 --> 02:21:33,510
Like...

3285
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:36,470
Is this a...

3286
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:37,970
Is this a successful relationship?

3287
02:21:39,050 --> 02:21:39,550
Phoebe!

3288
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:43,230
Thank you for the rain!

3289
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:51,950
I thought I'd be asking you to send some chills and frights my way because my AC broke yesterday, but they just fixed it in time for stream!

3290
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:54,510
Yeah, I'm so happy for you.

3291
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,270
Oh my gosh.

3292
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:58,330
My AC broke not so long ago, actually.

3293
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:01,170
Luckily, they fixed it pretty quickly, but...

3294
02:22:02,250 --> 02:22:03,570
I know your struggle.

3295
02:22:05,890 --> 02:22:07,150
I know your struggle.

3296
02:22:08,670 --> 02:22:09,150
Phoebe!

3297
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:11,570
Oh, here they are.

3298
02:22:12,410 --> 02:22:15,030
There's a strange smell coming from that hut.

3299
02:22:16,570 --> 02:22:17,570
Thank you, Siftu.

3300
02:22:17,590 --> 02:22:18,690
Thank you so much for that gift, though.

3301
02:22:19,070 --> 02:22:21,170
Take up and ya-nya and thank you for the gift, though!

3302
02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:24,730
What do you know about this stuffed toy?

3303
02:22:25,330 --> 02:22:27,790
Toby takes it with him wherever he goes.

3304
02:22:27,950 --> 02:22:31,490
I feel he is way too old for plush toys, but...

3305
02:22:31,490 --> 02:22:33,990
I guess I can forbid him everything.

3306
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:36,130
You can't be too old for plush toys.

3307
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:36,550
It's not easy, you're a single parent.

3308
02:22:38,270 --> 02:22:40,370
What do you mean, too old for plush toys?

3309
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:46,310
What's your favorite Magicorn?

3310
02:22:47,330 --> 02:22:50,350
This will say a lot about you, Mr. Dat Detective!

3311
02:22:50,350 --> 02:22:51,510
You're a favorite.

3312
02:22:51,950 --> 02:22:54,530
Oh, I think I am, um...

3313
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:55,250
Uh...

3314
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:56,590
I think I like...

3315
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,530
Mouch.

3316
02:23:00,990 --> 02:23:02,510
I like...

3317
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:03,570
Mouch.

3318
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:06,690
What a name.

3319
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:08,730
Mouch?

3320
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:10,970
That's a very basic one.

3321
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:15,730
I'll introduce you to some more Magicorn when we're back home.

3322
02:23:15,730 --> 02:23:16,970
They're laughing at me.

3323
02:23:17,690 --> 02:23:20,210
I say Mouch and they're laughing at me.

3324
02:23:20,990 --> 02:23:23,530
I guess you're not allowed to like a basic Poke...

3325
02:23:23,530 --> 02:23:24,150
I mean, a...

3326
02:23:24,690 --> 02:23:25,570
Magicorn anymore.

3327
02:23:26,410 --> 02:23:28,270
Do you know anything about this plushie?

3328
02:23:28,270 --> 02:23:30,670
I take cold, he walks with me everywhere.

3329
02:23:31,210 --> 02:23:33,790
But yesterday, she was gone.

3330
02:23:34,570 --> 02:23:35,130
Why?

3331
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:36,730
I couldn't find her at all.

3332
02:23:36,890 --> 02:23:37,330
Interesting.

3333
02:23:37,870 --> 02:23:40,990
And then, this morning, she was in front of our room.

3334
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:42,410
What is this accent?

3335
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:47,230
You can burr her if you want, but don't lose her.

3336
02:23:47,530 --> 02:23:48,810
I can burr her?

3337
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:50,090
Is that what you just said?

3338
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:52,670
I can what her?

3339
02:23:52,990 --> 02:23:54,050
Bury her?

3340
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:00,420
Bury her if you want.

3341
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:05,660
There's a suspicious smell coming from this...

3342
02:24:05,660 --> 02:24:10,540
The waft of incense and fresh linen were the first things to hit my nose.

3343
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:15,100
The decor of the hut screamed of spiritual freedom.

3344
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:21,220
But on closer inspection, this was a temple to unfettered materialism.

3345
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:23,100
She doesn't...

3346
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:23,500
She's...

3347
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:27,440
She is all, like, supposed to be spiritual and, like...

3348
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:29,240
Hippie dippie, but...

3349
02:24:29,240 --> 02:24:30,160
She's the exact...

3350
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:31,900
Her personality is the exact opposite.

3351
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:34,440
Oh my goodness, there's so many clothes in here.

3352
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:40,660
Oh, thank God, they're fake cows.

3353
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,980
Makes it less romantic, don't you think?

3354
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,060
What does that sound?

3355
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:48,860
Oh, it's the coffee pot.

3356
02:24:49,820 --> 02:24:51,320
What do we got in here?

3357
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:51,860
A recipe?

3358
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:53,320
Main chakras.

3359
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:55,040
Courage.

3360
02:24:55,480 --> 02:24:56,680
That's that symbol!

3361
02:24:58,760 --> 02:24:59,720
Love.

3362
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:01,700
It's a squiggle.

3363
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:05,240
Health is key.

3364
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:11,540
And the joy.

3365
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:13,000
Modifiers.

3366
02:25:13,380 --> 02:25:13,940
Lose.

3367
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:14,960
Gain.

3368
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:16,020
Last step.

3369
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:18,140
Burn something of the person...

3370
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:20,060
You're trying...

3371
02:25:20,060 --> 02:25:20,860
You want...

3372
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:21,540
You...

3373
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:22,160
Something...

3374
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:22,920
To affect.

3375
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:27,440
This can be a part of their body...

3376
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:28,640
Or their possessions.

3377
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:29,400
Oh!

3378
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:30,520
The...

3379
02:25:30,520 --> 02:25:31,840
The shirt!

3380
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:33,900
People will do anything...

3381
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:35,840
Including questionable rituals...

3382
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:38,280
To avoid doing any work themselves.

3383
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:40,120
I don't know about that.

3384
02:25:41,060 --> 02:25:41,500
This...

3385
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:43,440
Does look like a lot of work.

3386
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:44,760
So he wanted...

3387
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:45,160
What was it?

3388
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:45,760
Courage?

3389
02:25:47,900 --> 02:25:48,340
But...

3390
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:48,680
Perhaps?

3391
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:50,880
But it looked a little different than that symbol.

3392
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:56,100
All of these clothes still have the tags on.

3393
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:56,800
Oh, those are clothes!

3394
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:57,620
I thought they were books!

3395
02:25:57,620 --> 02:25:59,420
I have a ton of packages to send back.

3396
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:02,880
I have a feeling that will never happen.

3397
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:04,760
I thought they were books!

3398
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:06,700
Wait, they're all clothes!

3399
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,180
What is going on in here?

3400
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:11,820
What is happening?

3401
02:26:12,660 --> 02:26:12,960
Was it...

3402
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:13,040
Oh!

3403
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:15,020
Let's snoop on the laptop, baby!

3404
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:18,800
The symbol was indeed the same?

3405
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,320
Was it?

3406
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:21,460
I thought it had like a cross through it.

3407
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:23,000
Final notice.

3408
02:26:23,180 --> 02:26:24,300
Pending electric bill.

3409
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:26,460
Overdue bills.

3410
02:26:26,460 --> 02:26:27,760
Irresponsible?

3411
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:28,500
Or broke?

3412
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:29,160
I don't know.

3413
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:30,820
Television license.

3414
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:31,620
Wow!

3415
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,260
Check out our fashion sale!

3416
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:34,240
Reminder.

3417
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:35,340
Unpaid...

3418
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:36,660
Unpaid lease!

3419
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:39,540
We have...

3420
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:41,820
We have funny gifts.

3421
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:43,160
We have horoscope.

3422
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,740
We have coupons!

3423
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,160
We have bills.

3424
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:50,780
Zalandodo.shop.

3425
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:54,140
Four buns is crazy.

3426
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,600
We would get kicked out in there by then.

3427
02:26:56,840 --> 02:26:57,580
Shopping cart.

3428
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:59,020
Oh, this is the cart.

3429
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:00,060
This is not...

3430
02:27:00,060 --> 02:27:01,340
We're not window shopping here.

3431
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:03,560
23 items in the cart!

3432
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:12,140
Have you found something to bring?

3433
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,480
I'll bring one of my old shirts.

3434
02:27:16,160 --> 02:27:20,040
Yeah, you could also afford to bring one of your old shirts.

3435
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:25,640
I don't think I've ever had 23 things in a cart before.

3436
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:26,760
That's just like...

3437
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:27,280
That's insane.

3438
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:28,220
This...

3439
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:30,180
Gives me a lot of anxiety.

3440
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:33,060
Wow, me too.

3441
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:34,760
Me too!

3442
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:37,040
I think I've got...

3443
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:38,940
Everything in here.

3444
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:43,690
Yeah.

3445
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:45,070
Seems to be the case.

3446
02:27:47,190 --> 02:27:48,790
I have on Baie.

3447
02:27:50,350 --> 02:27:52,150
Not even in the grocery store?

3448
02:27:52,270 --> 02:27:53,170
Okay, but that's different.

3449
02:28:00,650 --> 02:28:01,670
Even steam sale.

3450
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:03,170
I don't think I've done that many.

3451
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:04,710
Okay, patterns in the sand.

3452
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:06,890
Okay, so...

3453
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:08,190
Amelia helped...

3454
02:28:08,910 --> 02:28:10,070
Theodore perform a...

3455
02:28:10,070 --> 02:28:11,410
A courage...

3456
02:28:11,410 --> 02:28:11,470
Wait.

3457
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:12,790
Perform a ritual...

3458
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:14,450
To make...

3459
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:15,070
Or wait.

3460
02:28:15,730 --> 02:28:16,330
Hold on.

3461
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:18,070
Theodore...

3462
02:28:18,690 --> 02:28:19,290
Gain...

3463
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:19,890
Courage.

3464
02:28:20,290 --> 02:28:20,530
Oh!

3465
02:28:21,850 --> 02:28:22,430
I was right!

3466
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:24,850
Theodore was trying to summon courage?

3467
02:28:25,310 --> 02:28:27,050
I wondered what for?

3468
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:28,030
Machine for Games!

3469
02:28:28,170 --> 02:28:28,710
Welcome to membership!

3470
02:28:29,070 --> 02:28:29,290
Thank you!

3471
02:28:29,310 --> 02:28:32,830
It was time I got back into snooping around Matilda's room.

3472
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:33,390
Nice.

3473
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:35,390
Oh, back to Matilda's room.

3474
02:28:35,610 --> 02:28:35,910
Okay.

3475
02:28:35,910 --> 02:28:37,070
The cabin.

3476
02:28:38,770 --> 02:28:40,270
Lank is being...

3477
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:41,710
Watched.

3478
02:28:41,830 --> 02:28:44,810
To try and gain access to...

3479
02:28:45,730 --> 02:28:47,110
To secrets.

3480
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:49,870
Secrets.

3481
02:28:50,410 --> 02:28:50,890
To...

3482
02:28:50,890 --> 02:28:53,090
To her military secrets!

3483
02:28:55,430 --> 02:28:56,950
Matilda's being watched!

3484
02:28:57,330 --> 02:28:59,030
Military secrets are at stake?

3485
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:02,430
I had to be careful not to stir the pot too soon.

3486
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:03,950
The less people knew, the better.

3487
02:29:03,950 --> 02:29:04,890
The less people knew, the better.

3488
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:05,710
The less people knew, the better.

3489
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:05,730
Woo!

3490
02:29:05,810 --> 02:29:07,730
This is how it must have went down.

3491
02:29:09,210 --> 02:29:09,930
Uh oh.

3492
02:29:10,110 --> 02:29:10,210
Oh.

3493
02:29:10,230 --> 02:29:15,110
Matilda Eisenman has brought sensitive military information with her to the campsite.

3494
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:21,710
Someone at the campsite seems to be after this intel.

3495
02:29:24,650 --> 02:29:31,170
And decided to spy on her by hiding a camera inside her son's plushie.

3496
02:29:34,710 --> 02:29:40,810
Also, it seems that Theodore Stumperton seeked out Emilia Dinkle's help.

3497
02:29:40,810 --> 02:29:42,570
But for courage for what?

3498
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:47,070
To perform a ritual that would grant him courage.

3499
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:48,250
Wow.

3500
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:58,650
It was time that I found out who this person was that was after the military secrets.

3501
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:00,090
Military secrets.

3502
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:00,310
This person.

3503
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:02,730
This is getting pretty serious.

3504
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:03,350
Yura yura.

3505
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:04,130
Kawaii.

3506
02:30:04,930 --> 02:30:05,090
Oh!

3507
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:07,730
In order to find out who is spying on the eyes and loves.

3508
02:30:08,490 --> 02:30:08,730
Yura yura.

3509
02:30:08,730 --> 02:30:12,210
We need to ask for access to all accommodations on this premise.

3510
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:13,190
What?

3511
02:30:17,930 --> 02:30:20,910
You see, it's really important that...

3512
02:30:20,910 --> 02:30:21,250
Yes.

3513
02:30:22,110 --> 02:30:22,190
Oh!

3514
02:30:22,650 --> 02:30:23,090
Freddie!

3515
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:28,750
Thank you for coming, everyone.

3516
02:30:29,070 --> 02:30:29,670
Is he a distraction?

3517
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:31,450
What?

3518
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:32,970
What are you...

3519
02:30:32,970 --> 02:30:36,930
The duck detective and I have made some serious deductions.

3520
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:37,990
Wait, he's taken all...

3521
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:41,410
And one of you is in serious trouble.

3522
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:42,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3523
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:44,550
Freddie...

3524
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:47,970
Because this someone is spying on the Eisenmans!

3525
02:30:48,170 --> 02:30:49,330
Why are you giving that away?

3526
02:30:49,570 --> 02:30:50,190
They're gonna leave.

3527
02:30:50,350 --> 02:30:51,390
All right, Frederson.

3528
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:52,650
This is enough.

3529
02:30:53,490 --> 02:30:55,090
He's blowing our case.

3530
02:30:55,610 --> 02:30:56,570
The window!

3531
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:57,390
Huh?

3532
02:30:58,830 --> 02:30:59,350
How...

3533
02:31:00,570 --> 02:31:02,070
How is this possible?

3534
02:31:02,470 --> 02:31:05,910
All the lamps have been stolen by vandals ages ago!

3535
02:31:08,410 --> 02:31:08,930
Oh...

3536
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:09,970
Yeah, he's stealing the beans!

3537
02:31:09,970 --> 02:31:10,450
There, it must be the ghost!

3538
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:12,170
Hold on!

3539
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:14,090
Where did my Toby go?

3540
02:31:14,310 --> 02:31:14,670
Uh-oh.

3541
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:16,590
He was just here a second ago!

3542
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:17,650
I don't think he was.

3543
02:31:17,830 --> 02:31:18,710
Do you see the fog rolling in?

3544
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:23,530
That means Patient 12 is coming out, looking for her son.

3545
02:31:23,870 --> 02:31:24,110
Oh!

3546
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:27,190
Can we stop with this ghost thing just for a moment?

3547
02:31:27,430 --> 02:31:27,930
The music is so nice.

3548
02:31:27,930 --> 02:31:30,110
Father will come and save you, little Toby!

3549
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:32,270
Not the mood.

3550
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:34,190
I'm definitely not getting any sleep tonight.

3551
02:31:37,970 --> 02:31:38,570
Spooky...

3552
02:31:38,570 --> 02:31:41,090
This was all getting far too dramatic.

3553
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:42,250
Freddie!

3554
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:45,310
To find out what was going on with these military secrets.

3555
02:31:45,450 --> 02:31:46,810
Freddie, I'm about to slap you!

3556
02:31:46,810 --> 02:31:50,050
I was also very curious to find a way into the abandoned sanatorium.

3557
02:31:50,730 --> 02:31:54,530
I should probably also find out where Toby disappeared to.

3558
02:31:54,790 --> 02:31:59,230
I wondered if that odd-looking shed by the toilets had anything to do with it.

3559
02:31:59,950 --> 02:32:02,370
This is so much fun, isn't it?

3560
02:32:03,050 --> 02:32:06,450
I bet this is much better than doing your detective work alone.

3561
02:32:07,390 --> 02:32:09,110
Don't talk to me.

3562
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:10,430
Yeah, actually...

3563
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:12,630
You really stepped over the line back there.

3564
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:12,910
You tell him!

3565
02:32:13,230 --> 02:32:13,810
You tell him!

3566
02:32:13,970 --> 02:32:14,170
Oh!

3567
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:15,590
Did I?

3568
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:18,770
Whatever.

3569
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:22,670
Oh, Freddie, you can't just...

3570
02:32:22,670 --> 02:32:23,910
You have to...

3571
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:24,670
If you...

3572
02:32:24,670 --> 02:32:27,310
If you show all your cards before...

3573
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:31,390
Before you have a conclusion, they're just gonna...

3574
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:34,510
They're gonna hide the evidence!

3575
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:37,310
He's so...

3576
02:32:37,310 --> 02:32:38,290
He's too silly!

3577
02:32:39,730 --> 02:32:41,910
Oh my gosh...

3578
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:46,170
Whoa...

3579
02:32:49,630 --> 02:32:50,110
Scary...

3580
02:32:51,450 --> 02:32:52,450
Can't we just...

3581
02:32:52,450 --> 02:32:53,230
Brick in?

3582
02:32:53,330 --> 02:32:54,010
No, why not?

3583
02:32:55,270 --> 02:32:57,890
A detective uses their brain...

3584
02:32:57,890 --> 02:32:58,470
Not their brawn.

3585
02:32:58,470 --> 02:32:58,610
Hear me out.

3586
02:32:59,410 --> 02:32:59,890
Murder...

3587
02:33:02,770 --> 02:33:03,250
Yeah...

3588
02:33:03,250 --> 02:33:05,650
He uses his brain, not his brawn.

3589
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:07,090
This is spooky, isn't it?

3590
02:33:07,870 --> 02:33:08,350
Yeah...

3591
02:33:08,350 --> 02:33:09,250
Are you easily spooked?

3592
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:10,350
No...

3593
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:11,090
Do you like horror movies?

3594
02:33:12,170 --> 02:33:12,650
Yes...

3595
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:14,590
Can I just do my work, please?

3596
02:33:15,130 --> 02:33:15,930
Oh, uh, of course.

3597
02:33:17,050 --> 02:33:18,850
The knife is still here.

3598
02:33:23,410 --> 02:33:24,010
Um...

3599
02:33:24,010 --> 02:33:24,250
Um...

3600
02:33:24,250 --> 02:33:26,230
He mentioned this shed, but...

3601
02:33:26,230 --> 02:33:28,750
That is the shed he's talking about, right?

3602
02:33:30,330 --> 02:33:32,050
Why don't you go to the...

3603
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:32,990
He said...

3604
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:33,570
The shed!

3605
02:33:34,190 --> 02:33:34,790
Oh!

3606
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:35,710
Oh no!

3607
02:33:36,710 --> 02:33:37,750
Clumsy duck!

3608
02:33:38,530 --> 02:33:38,950
Oh!

3609
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:47,160
I've come to confess my crimes.

3610
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:48,880
I love mint.

3611
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:52,560
Death penalty!

3612
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:54,420
Death penalty!

3613
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:58,400
This box wasn't here before!

3614
02:33:58,680 --> 02:33:59,120
What?

3615
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:01,660
If it has something to do with Toby's disappearance?

3616
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:03,920
Oh, my poor boy!

3617
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:05,540
What if he's in danger?

3618
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:07,080
What if he got kidnapped?

3619
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:08,500
You know?

3620
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:11,080
I should've put a GPS tracker on Toby!

3621
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:12,900
People made fun of me!

3622
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:15,700
But this just shows that people are in denial!

3623
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:18,300
At least he has his dog tag on him.

3624
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:21,100
His dog tag...

3625
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:21,980
It's like a...

3626
02:34:21,980 --> 02:34:23,220
It's like a literal collar.

3627
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:24,360
Whoa!

3628
02:34:24,920 --> 02:34:25,900
Triple geese.

3629
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:27,320
Mobile game.

3630
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:28,480
Magicorn Go!

3631
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:31,420
Oh!

3632
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,680
It's Magicorn Go!

3633
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:36,180
Magicorn Go!

3634
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:36,860
Magicorn Go to the polls!

3635
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:38,720
Natural bait.

3636
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:41,700
A key to...

3637
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:43,480
Number three.

3638
02:34:47,990 --> 02:34:49,410
I'm missing something.

3639
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:53,030
Missing one more thing.

3640
02:34:54,770 --> 02:34:55,410
It's bait.

3641
02:34:56,070 --> 02:34:56,770
Oh!

3642
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:02,310
I love mint too!

3643
02:35:02,470 --> 02:35:03,490
Don't tell anyone, okay?

3644
02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:03,570
Hey!

3645
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:08,430
Where are these confessions coming from?

3646
02:35:10,810 --> 02:35:13,470
Someone must've left in a hurry and forgot the box.

3647
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:14,550
A key!

3648
02:35:15,170 --> 02:35:17,250
Let's find out what this unlocks.

3649
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:18,430
Exciting!

3650
02:35:18,830 --> 02:35:20,510
I wasn't talking to you!

3651
02:35:25,750 --> 02:35:29,170
I mean, there's only one tent that we haven't gone into.

3652
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:36,050
You fools!

3653
02:35:36,250 --> 02:35:37,770
We are lament-o!

3654
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:41,610
Oh, Theodore was staying at this one.

3655
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:45,110
Kano wants to go home because of every single tiny thing!

3656
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:48,210
He's being way too dramatic!

3657
02:35:49,450 --> 02:35:49,780
Hmph.

3658
02:35:50,110 --> 02:35:51,490
How uncharacteristic.

3659
02:35:51,810 --> 02:35:53,630
Your sarcasm isn't helping.

3660
02:35:54,810 --> 02:35:56,970
I don't think he's being that dramatic.

3661
02:35:57,170 --> 02:35:59,590
His tent got broken into and his stuff was stolen.

3662
02:36:02,130 --> 02:36:05,550
I think, um, he's pretty valid, actually.

3663
02:36:06,450 --> 02:36:07,990
No, I am Sparta.

3664
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:09,670
I mean, I love mint.

3665
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,930
I love mint though!

3666
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:12,590
Please tell everyone!

3667
02:36:14,350 --> 02:36:14,870
Yippee!

3668
02:36:16,130 --> 02:36:17,850
I'm gonna jump off the cliff!

3669
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:19,850
Oh no!

3670
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,830
Oh no!

3671
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:21,670
Oh no!

3672
02:36:23,370 --> 02:36:25,530
We can't let the ghost keep the child!

3673
02:36:25,790 --> 02:36:27,250
We need to fight it!

3674
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:27,710
Why not?

3675
02:36:27,710 --> 02:36:30,570
This wasn't much of a blessing in disguise after all!

3676
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:32,210
Don't fight it!

3677
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:33,950
Let the ghost take the child!

3678
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:41,490
No, mint!

3679
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:43,810
Heehee!

3680
02:36:44,250 --> 02:36:46,390
I don't think we can do this one yet, right?

3681
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:48,750
His building looks what the door is locked.

3682
02:36:48,770 --> 02:36:49,150
Oh, that's right.

3683
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:49,730
What is this?

3684
02:36:50,310 --> 02:36:52,970
Yeah, it won't even let us touch, like, uh...

3685
02:36:54,250 --> 02:36:55,590
Won't even let me click it.

3686
02:36:55,590 --> 02:36:56,370
Oh no!

3687
02:36:56,490 --> 02:36:56,930
The pressure!

3688
02:36:57,330 --> 02:36:58,730
I must confess that!

3689
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:01,630
That what?

3690
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:03,510
That what?

3691
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:06,770
Is he in the hot tub?

3692
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:07,090
No.

3693
02:37:08,690 --> 02:37:09,930
I would be in.

3694
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:12,970
This is a perfect time for a hot tub.

3695
02:37:14,670 --> 02:37:16,410
Yeah, the lock uses the symbols.

3696
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:17,070
Exactly.

3697
02:37:17,070 --> 02:37:18,890
I feel like we should be able to...

3698
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:22,430
Unlock it now, but I guess not.

3699
02:37:22,750 --> 02:37:23,910
Okay, he's not in here either.

3700
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:29,390
You wanted to say something?

3701
02:37:29,710 --> 02:37:30,590
Are you still mad at me?

3702
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:31,190
Ooh.

3703
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:32,030
Yes.

3704
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:35,630
What can I do to make it up to you?

3705
02:37:35,830 --> 02:37:36,030
Ooh.

3706
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:39,150
Uh, do you want ice cream?

3707
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:41,610
I could hit you a magic horn.

3708
02:37:42,350 --> 02:37:43,950
Just like the one for Katya.

3709
02:37:44,910 --> 02:37:46,110
Just be quiet.

3710
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:47,190
Please.

3711
02:37:49,050 --> 02:37:51,270
Oh, speaking like, uh...

3712
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:53,090
There was the knitted...

3713
02:37:53,090 --> 02:37:53,810
Hold on, in here.

3714
02:37:54,970 --> 02:37:56,330
I saw...

3715
02:37:56,330 --> 02:37:56,930
This?

3716
02:37:58,710 --> 02:37:59,050
Um...

3717
02:37:59,050 --> 02:37:59,910
There was...

3718
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:01,810
I don't remember what convention it was.

3719
02:38:01,810 --> 02:38:03,130
But, um...

3720
02:38:03,130 --> 02:38:03,730
Ashton.

3721
02:38:04,050 --> 02:38:05,050
Ashton Martin.

3722
02:38:05,310 --> 02:38:06,190
Another VTuber.

3723
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:08,450
She...

3724
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:12,110
Saw someone that was selling crocheted Sanrio characters.

3725
02:38:12,470 --> 02:38:13,970
And she got me...

3726
02:38:13,970 --> 02:38:14,790
Hanamaru!

3727
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:15,970
I was so happy.

3728
02:38:16,430 --> 02:38:18,650
What is the deal with this ghost affair?

3729
02:38:19,030 --> 02:38:21,570
Do you believe in ghosts, detective?

3730
02:38:22,450 --> 02:38:23,070
Yes.

3731
02:38:24,590 --> 02:38:27,370
I've had some strange things happen to me.

3732
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:30,510
My dirty dishes on my desk would just...

3733
02:38:31,390 --> 02:38:31,990
Disappear.

3734
02:38:32,250 --> 02:38:34,310
Was this when you were still living with Anna?

3735
02:38:34,770 --> 02:38:35,010
Oh.

3736
02:38:35,890 --> 02:38:36,490
Um...

3737
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:36,750
Yes.

3738
02:38:37,210 --> 02:38:37,730
Why?

3739
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:39,410
Oh...

3740
02:38:39,410 --> 02:38:39,710
Nothing.

3741
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,230
Anyway.

3742
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:43,530
Whatever is happening here...

3743
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:46,250
Is definitely not caused by some ghost.

3744
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:49,050
Sounds like denial to me.

3745
02:38:49,610 --> 02:38:51,390
Not Anna picking up his dishes.

3746
02:38:52,490 --> 02:38:53,450
Radix, thank you!

3747
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:55,890
Thank you so much for 15 months.

3748
02:38:56,390 --> 02:38:58,690
I think Minto is pretty okay, I guess.

3749
02:39:00,330 --> 02:39:02,750
I too love Minto and I accept my death penalty.

3750
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:03,510
What is...

3751
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,870
What is...

3752
02:39:03,870 --> 02:39:04,270
What is...

3753
02:39:05,010 --> 02:39:05,990
What is all this?

3754
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:06,870
What is all this?

3755
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:08,370
You know what I say to this?

3756
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:11,370
That's what I say.

3757
02:39:12,650 --> 02:39:14,810
A load of honkin' baloney.

3758
02:39:15,390 --> 02:39:17,010
Good morning, Meebo.

3759
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:21,210
Good morning, Glitcherman.

3760
02:39:23,050 --> 02:39:24,530
Lost my train of thought.

3761
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:27,190
What was I saying?

3762
02:39:27,330 --> 02:39:28,610
Maybe I'll remember later.

3763
02:39:32,990 --> 02:39:34,850
Yeah, you should get that looked at.

3764
02:39:34,850 --> 02:39:35,030
Yes.

3765
02:39:35,790 --> 02:39:36,510
Do

3766
02:39:39,710 --> 02:39:42,210
you have any tips on how to date cute ghost maids?

3767
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:50,060
The dank caravan gave off a troubled energy.

3768
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:53,660
Just what did I walked into here?

3769
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:54,340
I don't know.

3770
02:39:55,700 --> 02:39:57,160
Whoa, it's red.

3771
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:58,380
Oh, my eyes!

3772
02:39:58,380 --> 02:40:00,780
It's like a beat in here.

3773
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:01,920
Whoa!

3774
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:02,040
Oh!

3775
02:40:03,660 --> 02:40:04,620
It's dank.

3776
02:40:04,980 --> 02:40:06,260
A dank energy.

3777
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:09,620
Drive them with merch.

3778
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:10,040
No!

3779
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:11,260
Wear a headband.

3780
02:40:12,580 --> 02:40:13,260
Close.

3781
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:16,940
Getting warmer.

3782
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:21,020
Oh, yeah.

3783
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:22,140
Knock it all over!

3784
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:23,280
Knock it all over!

3785
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,380
Wait, can I step in the bear trap?

3786
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:32,300
Oh, it's really sad that I can't knock all of these over.

3787
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:33,540
I'm not gonna lie.

3788
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:40,340
Some glasses.

3789
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:43,040
Reading glasses.

3790
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:46,900
Live, laugh, love!

3791
02:40:47,140 --> 02:40:48,200
L, L, L!

3792
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:50,660
Tacky.

3793
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:53,740
Courage.

3794
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:54,320
Health.

3795
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:54,940
Love.

3796
02:40:55,100 --> 02:40:55,520
Joy!

3797
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:56,500
It was joy!

3798
02:40:57,720 --> 02:40:58,740
Main chakras.

3799
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:02,100
This one is better.

3800
02:41:02,500 --> 02:41:05,080
The last few months, I've been thinking.

3801
02:41:05,440 --> 02:41:08,320
And I believe you deserve to know this.

3802
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:12,500
I'm hoping this will bring some peace to my mind.

3803
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:15,240
What did he do?

3804
02:41:16,540 --> 02:41:17,280
Guilt.

3805
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,420
I know this will seem sudden, but...

3806
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:23,340
Interesting.

3807
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:25,440
This note looks strange.

3808
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:28,160
I should ask people what they make of this.

3809
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:29,340
Yes.

3810
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:31,800
And the clue.

3811
02:41:33,180 --> 02:41:35,360
The music in here is so spooky.

3812
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:41,930
Oops.

3813
02:41:41,930 --> 02:41:43,830
One thing is for sure.

3814
02:41:44,150 --> 02:41:47,870
In here, it's impossible to die of starvation.

3815
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:50,310
Unless...

3816
02:41:50,750 --> 02:41:52,410
You can't open your mouth.

3817
02:41:56,930 --> 02:41:58,290
What do we got here?

3818
02:41:58,470 --> 02:41:59,470
Okay, this is a lot.

3819
02:41:59,950 --> 02:42:01,170
School club enrollment.

3820
02:42:01,910 --> 02:42:02,770
Eisenman Toby.

3821
02:42:03,910 --> 02:42:06,090
He did not make it into wrestling.

3822
02:42:06,490 --> 02:42:08,470
But that's connected to...

3823
02:42:08,470 --> 02:42:09,990
A picture of Toby.

3824
02:42:10,490 --> 02:42:12,130
Just connected to a...

3825
02:42:12,130 --> 02:42:12,430
Brezel.

3826
02:42:13,270 --> 02:42:14,030
Country.

3827
02:42:14,450 --> 02:42:15,150
East Canton.

3828
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:17,690
There he is!

3829
02:42:17,830 --> 02:42:18,890
On a boat!

3830
02:42:19,150 --> 02:42:20,310
Staring at the glaciers.

3831
02:42:21,170 --> 02:42:23,110
Sunny lakeside luxurious camping.

3832
02:42:24,910 --> 02:42:25,770
Another country.

3833
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:27,950
West Canton.

3834
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:31,830
Local kid wins magicorn tournament.

3835
02:42:32,090 --> 02:42:33,190
This guy is obsessed...

3836
02:42:33,550 --> 02:42:34,370
With Toby!

3837
02:42:36,810 --> 02:42:38,050
Timestamps?

3838
02:42:40,810 --> 02:42:41,930
Sunny lake.

3839
02:42:42,570 --> 02:42:43,950
Current location.

3840
02:42:46,490 --> 02:42:47,110
School.

3841
02:42:47,350 --> 02:42:48,350
Eisenman Toby.

3842
02:42:50,510 --> 02:42:51,130
Wait.

3843
02:42:51,490 --> 02:42:53,230
Purchases magicorn cards.

3844
02:42:54,470 --> 02:42:55,390
Cold...

3845
02:42:55,390 --> 02:42:56,010
Cold...

3846
02:42:56,010 --> 02:42:56,850
Cold...

3847
02:42:56,850 --> 02:42:58,070
Deluxe plushie.

3848
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:02,610
Why do we have a school ID?

3849
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:05,570
And then...

3850
02:43:05,570 --> 02:43:06,050
The...

3851
02:43:06,050 --> 02:43:07,830
The military photo from the mom.

3852
02:43:12,770 --> 02:43:14,420
This is all very suspicious.

3853
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:22,440
Sorry, I have a stretcher.

3854
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:23,900
Um...

3855
02:43:23,900 --> 02:43:26,060
I don't like this.

3856
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:27,880
Yeah.

3857
02:43:28,850 --> 02:43:29,340
That's...

3858
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:30,420
That's weird.

3859
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:33,260
That's weird.

3860
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,160
That's weird.

3861
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:36,560
Is...

3862
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:37,400
Is his sign...

3863
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:38,280
Is there a capybara?

3864
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:38,900
No!

3865
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:40,800
There wasn't capybara in the middle...

3866
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:41,000
Wait.

3867
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:45,920
You think?

3868
02:43:46,580 --> 02:43:47,800
But wouldn't she know?

3869
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:50,280
Wouldn't she recognize her...

3870
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:50,800
You know?

3871
02:43:51,980 --> 02:43:53,820
I don't think that's a capybara.

3872
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:55,680
I don't know what the heck that is.

3873
02:43:56,240 --> 02:43:58,440
That is Matilda, the mom.

3874
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:00,820
I don't know who the heck that...

3875
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:03,680
But those glasses...

3876
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:07,720
Those are the same...

3877
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:09,100
Are those not the same reading glasses?

3878
02:44:09,100 --> 02:44:10,600
The same blue ones in the suitcase?

3879
02:44:19,510 --> 02:44:20,290
Here, here.

3880
02:44:20,290 --> 02:44:20,330
There.

3881
02:44:22,970 --> 02:44:23,710
These.

3882
02:44:33,250 --> 02:44:33,990
Hmm...

3883
02:44:33,990 --> 02:44:35,150
Keep that in mind.

3884
02:44:36,530 --> 02:44:38,210
Keep that in mind.

3885
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:45,570
So now we ask everybody about...

3886
02:44:45,570 --> 02:44:46,370
Uh... something.

3887
02:44:46,890 --> 02:44:47,740
Oh, this...

3888
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:50,190
Can you tell me anything about these notes?

3889
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:50,970
The notes...

3890
02:44:50,970 --> 02:44:52,650
So much of it is crossed out.

3891
02:44:52,690 --> 02:44:52,710
Mary!

3892
02:44:53,230 --> 02:44:55,270
It doesn't scream of a very confident rider.

3893
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:57,650
Thank you!

3894
02:44:58,070 --> 02:44:58,590
For the breakdown!

3895
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:01,290
For Annie!

3896
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:02,670
For your Annie Red!

3897
02:45:04,010 --> 02:45:05,770
Congratulations on your four year!

3898
02:45:10,090 --> 02:45:11,330
Thank you for the gifted!

3899
02:45:12,210 --> 02:45:12,810
Hey, kiss!

3900
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:13,870
Bring it back, thank you!

3901
02:45:14,010 --> 02:45:14,830
Ducky, thank you!

3902
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:17,290
Congrats, congrats!

3903
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:19,510
Oh, I'm so old!

3904
02:45:20,330 --> 02:45:21,290
Yeah!

3905
02:45:23,090 --> 02:45:26,090
It's not like this year is my fifth year anniversary or anything.

3906
02:45:27,910 --> 02:45:29,110
You're so old!

3907
02:45:29,830 --> 02:45:30,730
You're so old!

3908
02:45:33,910 --> 02:45:34,870
Yeah!

3909
02:45:38,990 --> 02:45:40,330
But you're Boomer!

3910
02:45:42,970 --> 02:45:44,410
I'm Boomer!

3911
02:45:45,730 --> 02:45:46,350
Get it?

3912
02:45:49,270 --> 02:45:50,190
Murphy, thank you!

3913
02:45:50,550 --> 02:45:51,510
Paperbacks, thank you!

3914
02:45:51,690 --> 02:45:52,970
Teacup, nyan-nyan, thank you!

3915
02:45:53,270 --> 02:45:54,290
Ragpubrabu, thank you!

3916
02:45:55,250 --> 02:45:56,130
Cici, thank you!

3917
02:45:56,310 --> 02:45:57,170
Duargo, thank you!

3918
02:45:57,750 --> 02:45:58,490
Chase, thank you!

3919
02:45:58,710 --> 02:45:59,870
Thank you guys, all for the gifted.

3920
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:07,290
Alright, let's ask some more people about this...

3921
02:46:07,290 --> 02:46:08,370
Sussy note.

3922
02:46:09,010 --> 02:46:11,330
Do you notice anything about this...

3923
02:46:11,330 --> 02:46:11,770
Notebook?

3924
02:46:11,770 --> 02:46:13,390
I've never seen it.

3925
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:15,530
Wait, who says this?

3926
02:46:15,990 --> 02:46:17,050
Are you...

3927
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:19,230
Spying on people?

3928
02:46:19,630 --> 02:46:20,670
I'm a detective.

3929
02:46:21,450 --> 02:46:22,930
Snooping is my job.

3930
02:46:25,390 --> 02:46:26,190
Uh...

3931
02:46:26,190 --> 02:46:27,610
And now we leave.

3932
02:46:34,210 --> 02:46:36,510
Crocodiles make the most loyal friends.

3933
02:46:37,130 --> 02:46:37,390
Ah!

3934
02:46:38,650 --> 02:46:39,710
Hey, Mom!

3935
02:46:40,730 --> 02:46:41,890
What is this?

3936
02:46:41,890 --> 02:46:43,470
What do you make of these notes?

3937
02:46:44,110 --> 02:46:45,710
It will bring peace to my mind?

3938
02:46:46,030 --> 02:46:47,470
Who writes like this?

3939
02:46:47,770 --> 02:46:50,130
Is this some serial killer's diary?

3940
02:46:50,890 --> 02:46:53,310
You've been active for like two years?

3941
02:46:53,790 --> 02:46:55,330
Yeah, I guess that's true.

3942
02:46:56,670 --> 02:46:59,010
But I did start...

3943
02:46:59,010 --> 02:46:59,330
Fi...

3944
02:46:59,330 --> 02:46:59,790
Almost.

3945
02:47:00,130 --> 02:47:00,490
Almost.

3946
02:47:01,050 --> 02:47:02,090
Five years ago.

3947
02:47:03,650 --> 02:47:04,990
Actually, wait...

3948
02:47:07,900 --> 02:47:09,320
When was my debut?

3949
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:10,320
Wait a second.

3950
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,220
Did I put it in my calendar?

3951
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:25,720
Wait...

3952
02:47:40,900 --> 02:47:41,680
Uh...

3953
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:44,800
Uh...

3954
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:49,540
One moment.

3955
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:04,340
Uh-oh.

3956
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:05,320
Did I...

3957
02:48:05,320 --> 02:48:05,920
Miss it?

3958
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:05,940
What?

3959
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:12,780
I just realized it's July.

3960
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:19,400
Wait...

3961
02:48:27,540 --> 02:48:28,940
The 24th!

3962
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:33,160
Next week!

3963
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:37,740
Five...

3964
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:39,160
Year anniversary.

3965
02:48:39,540 --> 02:48:40,220
Can you guys tell?

3966
02:48:40,360 --> 02:48:41,040
I'm so...

3967
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:42,280
I'm so prepared!

3968
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:42,620
I'm so prepared!

3969
02:48:48,640 --> 02:48:49,070
No...

3970
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:49,960
Wow!

3971
02:48:52,680 --> 02:48:56,760
Oh my god!

3972
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:04,440
We let you know if you missed it.

3973
02:49:07,330 --> 02:49:08,560
Happy almost anniversary!

3974
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:09,540
Thank you!

3975
02:49:18,850 --> 02:49:19,710
Yeah!

3976
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:20,050
Hi!

3977
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:27,650
Last year, you made such a big deal of her one four-year.

3978
02:49:35,350 --> 02:49:35,870
Oopsie.

3979
02:49:37,590 --> 02:49:38,630
Okay, well...

3980
02:49:39,370 --> 02:49:41,270
That's not what we're worried about right now.

3981
02:49:41,390 --> 02:49:43,030
Right now, we've got a case to solve.

3982
02:49:48,090 --> 02:49:49,130
Where is...

3983
02:49:49,130 --> 02:49:50,470
Where is...

3984
02:49:50,470 --> 02:49:51,150
Not Toby.

3985
02:49:51,710 --> 02:49:52,690
That other guy.

3986
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:57,130
He doesn't even care about the note.

3987
02:49:57,570 --> 02:49:58,650
Where is that guy?

3988
02:49:58,750 --> 02:49:59,930
He's not out here, is he?

3989
02:50:04,750 --> 02:50:05,310
Okay...

3990
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:18,140
I didn't even see him.

3991
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:20,860
Hiding around here.

3992
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:22,900
Mr. Capybara!

3993
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:24,660
Was his name Theodore?

3994
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:26,460
Are you in here?

3995
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:27,640
Are you...

3996
02:50:27,640 --> 02:50:27,860
Wait!

3997
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:29,520
Why is this unlocked now?

3998
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:31,060
This toilet is making...

3999
02:50:31,060 --> 02:50:31,960
Sounds like it's...

4000
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:33,900
No, remember it!

4001
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:38,880
It was...

4002
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:39,600
It was not...

4003
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:40,120
Oh, here we go!

4004
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:40,920
We can do this now.

4005
02:50:42,060 --> 02:50:42,620
Uh...

4006
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:42,920
Shoot.

4007
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:45,120
It's live, laugh, love.

4008
02:50:46,620 --> 02:50:49,000
I think it's this one, then...

4009
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:50,840
Squiggle...

4010
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:52,000
Then...

4011
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:52,280
No?

4012
02:50:57,400 --> 02:50:58,440
Was that not it?

4013
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:00,800
Yeah, it was all taped up before.

4014
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:01,120
Yeah.

4015
02:51:10,650 --> 02:51:11,410
Uh...

4016
02:51:11,410 --> 02:51:12,150
Where's the book?

4017
02:51:12,910 --> 02:51:14,050
Of symbols.

4018
02:51:14,910 --> 02:51:16,270
Book of symbols!

4019
02:51:17,950 --> 02:51:18,930
Book of symbols!

4020
02:51:20,450 --> 02:51:21,870
Where are you?

4021
02:51:22,390 --> 02:51:23,390
Oh, here we go.

4022
02:51:24,450 --> 02:51:25,050
Love!

4023
02:51:25,450 --> 02:51:26,830
Live, laugh, love.

4024
02:51:26,990 --> 02:51:28,490
So squiggle is...

4025
02:51:28,490 --> 02:51:30,230
So it'll be joy...

4026
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:35,140
Joy...

4027
02:51:35,140 --> 02:51:35,720
Joy...

4028
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:37,940
Health, love.

4029
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:40,280
Right?

4030
02:51:47,950 --> 02:51:49,110
What was joy again?

4031
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:49,750
Wait...

4032
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:50,050
Oh, shoot.

4033
02:51:50,910 --> 02:51:51,970
This one...

4034
02:51:51,970 --> 02:51:53,650
And then...

4035
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:54,610
This one.

4036
02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:55,910
Eh?

4037
02:51:56,390 --> 02:51:57,230
Wait, did I...

4038
02:51:57,230 --> 02:51:57,530
Oh, wait.

4039
02:51:58,730 --> 02:52:01,510
Live, health, laugh is joy.

4040
02:52:01,890 --> 02:52:02,630
There we go.

4041
02:52:03,310 --> 02:52:04,450
I'm such a...

4042
02:52:04,450 --> 02:52:05,990
I'm a fake wine mommy.

4043
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:07,270
Ah, I did it!

4044
02:52:07,490 --> 02:52:08,130
Alright.

4045
02:52:08,810 --> 02:52:11,810
Let's see what's inside this strange building.

4046
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:12,290
Yay!

4047
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:16,030
We still haven't found Theodore, though.

4048
02:52:17,250 --> 02:52:18,450
Toby's whereabouts.

4049
02:52:20,070 --> 02:52:21,390
Toby is...

4050
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:23,770
In...

4051
02:52:24,970 --> 02:52:25,630
The...

4052
02:52:25,630 --> 02:52:26,410
Lake.

4053
02:52:27,930 --> 02:52:28,890
Okay, hold on.

4054
02:52:29,530 --> 02:52:30,730
We're not there yet.

4055
02:52:30,930 --> 02:52:31,450
Oop, my bad.

4056
02:52:31,450 --> 02:52:32,630
We're not there yet.

4057
02:52:34,370 --> 02:52:35,090
Yeah!

4058
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:42,400
The moldy stench invaded my nostrils.

4059
02:52:42,900 --> 02:52:45,460
And made me dread what was to come.

4060
02:52:45,900 --> 02:52:48,520
But there was no going back now.

4061
02:52:50,240 --> 02:52:51,280
Thank you!

4062
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:55,700
What an adventure this is, right, Mr. Duck Detective?

4063
02:52:59,120 --> 02:52:59,180
I...

4064
02:52:59,940 --> 02:53:00,500
Uh...

4065
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:00,880
Eugene...

4066
02:53:01,640 --> 02:53:02,200
I...

4067
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:02,660
Uh...

4068
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:04,540
About before...

4069
02:53:04,540 --> 02:53:05,460
Mm-hmm, huh.

4070
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:06,820
I shouldn't have meddled...

4071
02:53:06,820 --> 02:53:07,980
With your detective face.

4072
02:53:08,180 --> 02:53:08,200
Come back on!

4073
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:09,940
Uh, uh...

4074
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:11,680
Debbie, thank you so much for the courage.

4075
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:15,500
Thank you, we're solving a...

4076
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:17,100
Not a murder mystery today.

4077
02:53:17,440 --> 02:53:18,120
Well, you better step up then.

4078
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:19,360
Y-yes!

4079
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:20,080
I-I will!

4080
02:53:20,080 --> 02:53:21,500
I hope you had fun at the hospital.

4081
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:24,140
I'll be the best sidekick ever from now on.

4082
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:27,020
All right, we should move on.

4083
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:29,360
Some kid just got kidnapped.

4084
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:32,960
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the brave of me.

4085
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:35,560
Fargo, thank you so much.

4086
02:53:36,140 --> 02:53:37,520
Thank you, thank you so much.

4087
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:43,680
So many people, thank you.

4088
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:47,100
Superliminal, thank you, chain, thank you.

4089
02:53:48,260 --> 02:53:49,460
Spankin' arm, thank you.

4090
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:52,580
Thank you.

4091
02:53:53,240 --> 02:53:53,920
Thank you, thank you.

4092
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:54,160
Yes, sir.

4093
02:53:54,840 --> 02:53:55,380
Come back.

4094
02:53:56,040 --> 02:53:57,500
Come back, naplings.

4095
02:53:58,360 --> 02:53:58,880
Okay, here.

4096
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:00,580
Actually, this is good.

4097
02:54:00,780 --> 02:54:03,360
This is good for a summary, right?

4098
02:54:04,220 --> 02:54:04,900
So...

4099
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,960
Since people are here.

4100
02:54:07,580 --> 02:54:09,960
We are duck detective.

4101
02:54:10,500 --> 02:54:13,520
And we are doing deductions.

4102
02:54:14,140 --> 02:54:16,040
And this is our assistant, Freddy.

4103
02:54:16,460 --> 02:54:18,140
He's a little eccentric.

4104
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:21,720
But he's actually more normal than duck detective, I think.

4105
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:24,360
And we went to this...

4106
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:26,220
To this campsite.

4107
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:28,480
Because Freddy likes...

4108
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:31,760
Going to horror locations.

4109
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:35,600
And he also wanted to spend time with his girlfriend.

4110
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:38,030
And while we were here...

4111
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:39,600
There is...

4112
02:54:41,350 --> 02:54:41,820
Oops.

4113
02:54:42,540 --> 02:54:43,780
There's a cast.

4114
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:45,120
We got Emilia.

4115
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:46,120
She...

4116
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:46,840
Is...

4117
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:48,520
The manager of the...

4118
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:49,060
Of the...

4119
02:54:49,060 --> 02:54:50,220
The campgrounds.

4120
02:54:50,220 --> 02:54:50,520
Is...

4121
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:51,280
Matilda.

4122
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:53,260
And her...

4123
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:54,080
Son...

4124
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:54,420
Toby.

4125
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:56,480
Katya.

4126
02:54:56,880 --> 02:54:57,220
Is...

4127
02:54:57,220 --> 02:54:57,960
Freddy's girlfriend.

4128
02:54:58,560 --> 02:54:59,520
And Katya.

4129
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:01,520
Is the manager of this...

4130
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:01,700
Bunny.

4131
02:55:01,900 --> 02:55:03,080
Who is a chess...

4132
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:03,820
Fluencer.

4133
02:55:05,420 --> 02:55:06,220
And...

4134
02:55:06,220 --> 02:55:07,200
Then Theodore.

4135
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:08,940
Who is just a capybara.

4136
02:55:11,140 --> 02:55:13,480
And we found out that...

4137
02:55:13,480 --> 02:55:15,020
Matilda's in the army.

4138
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:17,300
And someone is spying on her...

4139
02:55:17,300 --> 02:55:18,420
For military secrets.

4140
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:19,820
And also...

4141
02:55:19,820 --> 02:55:21,500
Matilda's son just got kidnapped...

4142
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:22,460
By a ghost maybe.

4143
02:55:26,860 --> 02:55:27,500
And...

4144
02:55:29,360 --> 02:55:30,640
Did I cover everything?

4145
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,460
Oh, and...

4146
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:33,640
Arno...

4147
02:55:33,640 --> 02:55:34,960
And Matilda...

4148
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:37,380
Were having like a king and queen fling.

4149
02:55:37,460 --> 02:55:38,260
It was kind of crazy.

4150
02:55:40,660 --> 02:55:41,820
Right now...

4151
02:55:41,820 --> 02:55:42,840
We're trying to find...

4152
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:44,300
We're trying to find Toby.

4153
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:46,800
And Toby is maybe British.

4154
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:47,900
Wait...

4155
02:55:49,260 --> 02:55:51,500
Maybe British and also...

4156
02:55:51,860 --> 02:55:53,360
Really loves Magicorn.

4157
02:55:53,560 --> 02:55:54,060
Which is basically...

4158
02:55:54,580 --> 02:55:54,860
Pokemon.

4159
02:55:59,250 --> 02:56:00,910
Tell them about the chest butt plug.

4160
02:56:01,350 --> 02:56:02,710
No, no, no, no.

4161
02:56:06,590 --> 02:56:07,230
That's...

4162
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:14,360
That's unconfirmed.

4163
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:20,560
Wait, hold on.

4164
02:56:20,620 --> 02:56:22,060
I want to go check real quick.

4165
02:56:22,480 --> 02:56:24,600
Before we go in through there.

4166
02:56:25,880 --> 02:56:26,940
I want to see...

4167
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:27,820
If maybe...

4168
02:56:27,820 --> 02:56:28,260
Because we're...

4169
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:29,760
I don't know where Theodore is.

4170
02:56:30,500 --> 02:56:31,600
We've lost that...

4171
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:32,740
We've lost sight of that guy.

4172
02:56:35,620 --> 02:56:37,720
My ears just perked up.

4173
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:42,240
Well, there's just a lot of lotion in this guy's tent.

4174
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:43,500
And he plays chess.

4175
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:44,700
I don't even got...

4176
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:45,800
Have you guys heard about that?

4177
02:56:46,060 --> 02:56:47,660
The chess player who...

4178
02:56:47,660 --> 02:56:50,500
Maybe cheated because he was getting fed answers...

4179
02:56:51,060 --> 02:56:52,620
Through possible...

4180
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:56,240
Vibrations of an apparatus up his bum hole.

4181
02:56:57,420 --> 02:56:58,820
It's a true story.

4182
02:57:00,180 --> 02:57:01,320
Nice jazzy game.

4183
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:04,000
Also your jazzy cover of Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday is the second...

4184
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,160
Search result on YouTube!

4185
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:07,440
We might get it to number one.

4186
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:07,760
No!

4187
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:09,980
Wait, I don't want it to number one.

4188
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:11,500
The original deserves number one.

4189
02:57:14,020 --> 02:57:16,000
Oh yeah, there was also some witchcraft.

4190
02:57:21,250 --> 02:57:23,310
Guess I've been cheating at chess too.

4191
02:57:23,910 --> 02:57:23,990
Oh.

4192
02:57:27,050 --> 02:57:28,070
It's not good...

4193
02:57:28,710 --> 02:57:29,470
To cheat.

4194
02:57:32,910 --> 02:57:34,670
Can we go into our own tent?

4195
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:35,790
No, let's...

4196
02:57:38,390 --> 02:57:39,050
Um...

4197
02:57:39,050 --> 02:57:39,170
Alright.

4198
02:57:39,410 --> 02:57:41,130
Let's go into the spooky sewer.

4199
02:57:46,610 --> 02:57:48,150
It's allegedly Minto.

4200
02:57:48,430 --> 02:57:49,570
It was never proven.

4201
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:52,030
Yeah.

4202
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:57,030
But in this game also, it was never proven.

4203
02:58:04,610 --> 02:58:06,350
Oh gosh, this is...

4204
02:58:06,350 --> 02:58:10,080
This sewage passageway is right below the toilet.

4205
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:17,680
I hope we don't come...

4206
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:19,300
Are we in the sanatorium?

4207
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:20,560
No way.

4208
02:58:21,820 --> 02:58:22,400
Ooh!

4209
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:23,140
Ooh!

4210
02:58:23,280 --> 02:58:26,180
When we're back home, let's watch the new season of Whale Tail.

4211
02:58:26,580 --> 02:58:28,220
I'd like that, yes.

4212
02:58:28,660 --> 02:58:29,900
Ah, they're buddies.

4213
02:58:30,380 --> 02:58:30,760
You know what?

4214
02:58:31,360 --> 02:58:36,980
Tomorrow, we should go for a hike, have a picnic, and play some frisbee.

4215
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:38,300
Maybe.

4216
02:58:38,980 --> 02:58:42,020
All the naplings came from one hospital to another.

4217
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,380
I hope we have our tetanus shot.

4218
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:46,260
The bus ride home will be so fun!

4219
02:58:46,580 --> 02:58:49,940
I can get out the travel edition of Battleships again!

4220
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:51,240
Uh, yeah.

4221
02:58:52,040 --> 02:58:53,760
Let's not overdo it.

4222
02:58:56,200 --> 02:58:57,360
Battleship sounds fun!

4223
02:58:57,720 --> 02:58:58,140
What's this?

4224
02:58:58,820 --> 02:58:59,340
Oh!

4225
02:58:59,660 --> 02:59:00,080
A breaker?

4226
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:01,980
Fuse box.

4227
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:02,900
Very high up.

4228
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:03,640
Impractical.

4229
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:07,980
No dust.

4230
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:09,020
Clean spot.

4231
02:59:09,300 --> 02:59:10,820
So it was knocked over recently.

4232
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:18,400
Probably, someone knocked it over so that they could reach the fuse box, so that they could turn on the light to make it seem haunted!

4233
02:59:20,340 --> 02:59:20,860
Glasses.

4234
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:22,700
Stained with blood!

4235
02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:28,000
I wonder what caused this statue to fall.

4236
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:28,920
A person.

4237
02:59:31,260 --> 02:59:31,860
Whoa!

4238
02:59:34,620 --> 02:59:36,240
There's a whole set up in here.

4239
02:59:36,320 --> 02:59:38,620
I don't know about this, Mr. Duck Detective.

4240
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:42,840
This looks like some villain's lair.

4241
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:44,480
That window.

4242
02:59:44,820 --> 02:59:47,300
We must be inside the sanatorium.

4243
02:59:47,640 --> 02:59:50,660
I'm so close to the truth, I can feel it!

4244
02:59:50,700 --> 02:59:51,960
I can feel it.

4245
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:53,640
The camping chairs!

4246
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:55,280
That's where they went!

4247
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:56,000
The stolen camping chairs!

4248
02:59:56,280 --> 02:59:56,360
That's where they went!

4249
02:59:56,360 --> 02:59:57,260
From the very beginning!

4250
02:59:57,960 --> 02:59:59,520
Scaredy croc achieved.

4251
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:00,340
That's uh...

4252
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:02,820
I got this for entering the sanatorium.

4253
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:06,700
Toby's whereabouts.

4254
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:09,000
Toby is in the lake.

4255
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:15,280
With...

4256
03:00:15,960 --> 03:00:16,600
With...

4257
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:18,140
Theodore...

4258
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:20,080
Dying...

4259
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:22,360
For secrets.

4260
03:00:29,440 --> 03:00:30,920
We're a little clumsy.

4261
03:00:31,100 --> 03:00:32,580
We knock a bunch of stuff over.

4262
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:36,560
We're...

4263
03:00:36,560 --> 03:00:37,620
Dustless...

4264
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:38,020
Stiff...

4265
03:00:38,620 --> 03:00:39,020
Doof...

4266
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:39,560
Yes.

4267
03:00:40,320 --> 03:00:41,900
Oh, that's kind of freaky actually.

4268
03:00:43,740 --> 03:00:44,540
Uh...

4269
03:00:45,420 --> 03:00:47,100
Let's check out the computer first.

4270
03:00:48,100 --> 03:00:48,960
Okay, here we go.

4271
03:00:49,700 --> 03:00:50,260
MagiCorn.

4272
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:50,680
Yeah.

4273
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:52,200
OS update.

4274
03:00:52,540 --> 03:00:52,600
Oh!

4275
03:00:54,840 --> 03:00:55,800
Unpredicted restart.

4276
03:00:56,040 --> 03:00:57,740
Is that why the lights started glowing?

4277
03:00:58,800 --> 03:01:00,180
Ministry of information.

4278
03:01:00,900 --> 03:01:03,780
We protect the people of West Canton.

4279
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:07,840
Sarah Blackhurst, age 29.

4280
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:08,580
Goat!

4281
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:10,960
Role illegal resident agent.

4282
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:16,140
Now we don't know who that is.

4283
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:19,260
Camel crush.

4284
03:01:19,720 --> 03:01:20,280
Queen!

4285
03:01:20,760 --> 03:01:22,040
Here it is.

4286
03:01:22,240 --> 03:01:23,480
Come and get your present.

4287
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:27,520
What?

4288
03:01:29,580 --> 03:01:31,120
Are these military secrets?

4289
03:01:34,550 --> 03:01:36,150
Is this the king and queen?

4290
03:01:38,970 --> 03:01:41,230
This is all very dubious.

4291
03:01:41,310 --> 03:01:42,190
It is very dubious.

4292
03:01:42,710 --> 03:01:43,490
Sarah Blackhurst.

4293
03:01:43,690 --> 03:01:44,850
Who is that?

4294
03:01:47,290 --> 03:01:48,550
Mint is a goat?

4295
03:01:48,890 --> 03:01:49,710
I'm the goat.

4296
03:01:51,390 --> 03:01:53,290
I'm the ghost of all time.

4297
03:02:00,150 --> 03:02:01,430
The sanatorium.

4298
03:02:01,650 --> 03:02:03,670
The sanatorium was set up by...

4299
03:02:03,670 --> 03:02:04,670
Was it...

4300
03:02:05,370 --> 03:02:07,470
The chess player guy?

4301
03:02:08,270 --> 03:02:09,050
Since...

4302
03:02:10,330 --> 03:02:11,110
His...

4303
03:02:12,350 --> 03:02:14,670
Chess piece matches the...

4304
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:18,350
Of the photo.

4305
03:02:19,170 --> 03:02:19,590
Wait.

4306
03:02:20,310 --> 03:02:20,970
Oh, nope.

4307
03:02:21,070 --> 03:02:21,430
Not...

4308
03:02:21,430 --> 03:02:22,950
Oh, it's completely wrong.

4309
03:02:26,810 --> 03:02:27,950
Wait, wait, wait.

4310
03:02:28,270 --> 03:02:29,090
One more time.

4311
03:02:29,090 --> 03:02:30,190
What the...

4312
03:02:31,830 --> 03:02:32,950
Is this...

4313
03:02:32,950 --> 03:02:34,690
Message coming to or from?

4314
03:02:34,710 --> 03:02:35,470
I can't tell.

4315
03:02:36,550 --> 03:02:37,430
But then this...

4316
03:02:37,430 --> 03:02:39,090
Seems kind of military-esque, no?

4317
03:02:44,350 --> 03:02:45,370
So me...

4318
03:02:45,370 --> 03:02:45,730
Oh, wait.

4319
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:46,290
Not here.

4320
03:02:46,690 --> 03:02:47,990
I wanna do this one first.

4321
03:02:48,750 --> 03:02:49,330
Matilda.

4322
03:02:51,110 --> 03:02:51,790
No.

4323
03:02:52,590 --> 03:02:53,610
Matilda's not...

4324
03:02:55,210 --> 03:02:56,830
Queen was Matilda.

4325
03:02:59,090 --> 03:03:01,330
This chess piece matches the whole...

4326
03:03:02,370 --> 03:03:02,890
Wait.

4327
03:03:03,130 --> 03:03:03,570
I didn't...

4328
03:03:03,570 --> 03:03:04,530
Oh, this mess...

4329
03:03:05,770 --> 03:03:06,210
No.

4330
03:03:10,770 --> 03:03:11,730
The notebook.

4331
03:03:13,170 --> 03:03:15,850
The famous movie, The Notebook.

4332
03:03:23,370 --> 03:03:24,250
Huh...

4333
03:03:28,050 --> 03:03:30,470
Does this belong to the goat, though?

4334
03:03:31,610 --> 03:03:34,030
Because our goat is Katya.

4335
03:03:36,050 --> 03:03:36,550
Oh, gosh.

4336
03:03:36,650 --> 03:03:37,430
She looks so scary.

4337
03:03:38,890 --> 03:03:40,730
Maybe it does belong to her, then.

4338
03:03:46,510 --> 03:03:47,750
Since her...

4339
03:03:53,890 --> 03:03:55,510
But did it have a photo?

4340
03:03:57,230 --> 03:03:58,990
Which Ryan is in that movie?

4341
03:03:59,190 --> 03:04:01,130
The notebook is...

4342
03:04:01,910 --> 03:04:02,230
Ryan...

4343
03:04:02,820 --> 03:04:03,130
Gosling.

4344
03:04:03,470 --> 03:04:04,350
I remember.

4345
03:04:09,090 --> 03:04:09,710
Wait!

4346
03:04:10,840 --> 03:04:11,670
Wait, wait, wait.

4347
03:04:11,670 --> 03:04:12,910
Um...

4348
03:04:12,910 --> 03:04:13,170
Hold on.

4349
03:04:14,530 --> 03:04:15,450
Didn't...

4350
03:04:15,450 --> 03:04:16,330
She have...

4351
03:04:16,330 --> 03:04:18,190
The bruise on her arm?

4352
03:04:19,410 --> 03:04:20,430
So what...

4353
03:04:20,430 --> 03:04:21,010
That...

4354
03:04:21,010 --> 03:04:22,590
What does the bruise have to do with it?

4355
03:04:24,310 --> 03:04:26,150
Illegal resident...

4356
03:04:26,670 --> 03:04:27,350
Sarah...

4357
03:04:27,350 --> 03:04:29,030
She's lying to Freddy.

4358
03:04:30,430 --> 03:04:31,910
But there's no bruise...

4359
03:04:31,910 --> 03:04:32,610
Here?

4360
03:04:33,010 --> 03:04:33,570
No?

4361
03:04:35,170 --> 03:04:35,810
Oh my goodness.

4362
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:36,910
So many redirects today.

4363
03:04:37,070 --> 03:04:37,690
Thank you.

4364
03:04:38,030 --> 03:04:38,610
Bossy Moon.

4365
03:04:39,570 --> 03:04:40,270
Welcome, welcome.

4366
03:04:41,090 --> 03:04:41,830
Thank you so much.

4367
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:02,980
Rock for Robo, thank you so much.

4368
03:05:04,220 --> 03:05:05,620
Luan, welcome to Babusha.

4369
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:06,280
Thank you.

4370
03:05:06,560 --> 03:05:07,340
Thank you, thank you.

4371
03:05:07,520 --> 03:05:08,240
Hello, everybody.

4372
03:05:10,540 --> 03:05:11,520
Hello, hello.

4373
03:05:11,520 --> 03:05:11,640
Hello.

4374
03:05:14,060 --> 03:05:16,100
Ah, I'm stumped with this one.

4375
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:26,200
There was...

4376
03:05:26,200 --> 03:05:28,020
Cause I can't say bruise.

4377
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:28,600
What?

4378
03:05:32,100 --> 03:05:32,740
What?

4379
03:05:33,080 --> 03:05:33,720
Where?

4380
03:05:34,040 --> 03:05:36,180
I did not see the shape of the bruise.

4381
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:38,240
In...

4382
03:05:38,240 --> 03:05:38,680
Huh?

4383
03:05:50,990 --> 03:05:51,630
This...

4384
03:05:52,390 --> 03:05:53,210
Matches what?

4385
03:06:00,090 --> 03:06:00,730
Wait...

4386
03:06:02,790 --> 03:06:03,990
Is it that?

4387
03:06:05,190 --> 03:06:06,710
Is it the statue?

4388
03:06:07,210 --> 03:06:09,050
For her to push over the statue?

4389
03:06:09,690 --> 03:06:11,450
Oh my gosh, it totally is.

4390
03:06:11,550 --> 03:06:12,670
It's got that little notch.

4391
03:06:14,870 --> 03:06:16,110
Oh my god!

4392
03:06:16,370 --> 03:06:17,490
Matches the...

4393
03:06:19,090 --> 03:06:19,730
Uh...

4394
03:06:19,730 --> 03:06:20,670
The statue...

4395
03:06:20,670 --> 03:06:21,090
Wait, no.

4396
03:06:21,890 --> 03:06:22,470
The...

4397
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:23,350
Glasses...

4398
03:06:23,350 --> 03:06:24,310
Of the statue.

4399
03:06:27,110 --> 03:06:29,230
Katya was the one who set up the lair.

4400
03:06:30,290 --> 03:06:30,570
Ah...

4401
03:06:31,010 --> 03:06:33,630
Gosh, I forgot about that bruise so long ago.

4402
03:06:36,290 --> 03:06:37,850
Oh, we have everything here too.

4403
03:06:38,450 --> 03:06:39,310
Wait, Toby's whereabouts.

4404
03:06:39,430 --> 03:06:40,710
Toby is...

4405
03:06:41,590 --> 03:06:42,150
Under...

4406
03:06:42,150 --> 03:06:42,690
The lake.

4407
03:06:43,730 --> 03:06:44,850
He's drowning!

4408
03:06:45,910 --> 03:06:47,450
He's in the lake!

4409
03:06:47,670 --> 03:06:49,230
He's under the lake!

4410
03:06:49,590 --> 03:06:50,370
He's underwater.

4411
03:06:50,370 --> 03:06:52,370
Somebody save Toby!

4412
03:06:53,410 --> 03:06:55,430
He is on the lake.

4413
03:06:55,750 --> 03:06:56,870
With Theodore.

4414
03:07:01,190 --> 03:07:01,670
Screaming!

4415
03:07:02,510 --> 03:07:03,190
Wait, hold on.

4416
03:07:07,570 --> 03:07:10,250
I think he's probably doing Magicorn things.

4417
03:07:11,370 --> 03:07:13,210
He's looking for Magicorns.

4418
03:07:13,210 --> 03:07:13,850
So...

4419
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:15,990
So that's what Toby was up to.

4420
03:07:16,170 --> 03:07:17,010
Because we saw his little...

4421
03:07:17,010 --> 03:07:17,550
His little...

4422
03:07:17,550 --> 03:07:18,530
His little...

4423
03:07:18,530 --> 03:07:18,590
Okay.

4424
03:07:18,590 --> 03:07:19,290
I mean...

4425
03:07:19,290 --> 03:07:20,910
His Magicorn Go.

4426
03:07:21,050 --> 03:07:24,110
I should first figure out the whole mystery of the campsite.

4427
03:07:24,270 --> 03:07:26,450
We saw his Magicorn Go...

4428
03:07:26,450 --> 03:07:26,610
Before I made any announcements.

4429
03:07:27,010 --> 03:07:27,390
Uh...

4430
03:07:27,390 --> 03:07:27,710
Phone.

4431
03:07:28,330 --> 03:07:28,810
Okay.

4432
03:07:29,050 --> 03:07:29,570
Oh my goodness.

4433
03:07:29,770 --> 03:07:30,190
Katya.

4434
03:07:31,350 --> 03:07:33,070
Katya is in...

4435
03:07:34,890 --> 03:07:35,490
Disguise.

4436
03:07:36,990 --> 03:07:38,510
And using a...

4437
03:07:39,250 --> 03:07:39,630
Fake...

4438
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:41,530
Name.

4439
03:07:42,270 --> 03:07:44,490
This means she is a spy...

4440
03:07:46,290 --> 03:07:47,610
For the...

4441
03:07:47,610 --> 03:07:49,010
Is it the East or West?

4442
03:07:51,410 --> 03:07:53,710
There were two different countries we saw.

4443
03:07:57,080 --> 03:07:58,240
The West?

4444
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,000
The West.

4445
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:02,060
The West.

4446
03:08:05,880 --> 03:08:06,480
Haha!

4447
03:08:08,900 --> 03:08:11,820
Frederson's girlfriend was a spy for the West?

4448
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:12,520
Oh my god.

4449
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:16,100
Does that mean she was using him as a cover?

4450
03:08:17,300 --> 03:08:18,340
That's why she...

4451
03:08:18,340 --> 03:08:20,980
That's why she didn't seem like she liked him.

4452
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:21,360
Alright.

4453
03:08:21,980 --> 03:08:26,080
Another missing puzzle piece was the location of these secret documents.

4454
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:28,540
Oh my goodness.

4455
03:08:29,080 --> 03:08:29,960
Hiding spot.

4456
03:08:30,140 --> 03:08:32,460
The military secrets are hidden in the...

4457
03:08:37,070 --> 03:08:38,470
In the broken toilet, maybe?

4458
03:08:40,870 --> 03:08:41,430
Ah!

4459
03:08:42,810 --> 03:08:43,870
Of course!

4460
03:08:44,130 --> 03:08:44,370
Why?

4461
03:08:44,710 --> 03:08:48,050
Matilda hid the secret documents in the broken toilet!

4462
03:08:48,190 --> 03:08:48,770
Why'd she do that?

4463
03:08:48,850 --> 03:08:51,230
That's the one place no one would look.

4464
03:08:51,410 --> 03:08:52,190
Justice for Freddy!

4465
03:08:52,590 --> 03:08:52,770
Alright.

4466
03:08:52,770 --> 03:08:57,130
I should first work out the whole case before I do anything about these documents.

4467
03:08:57,130 --> 03:08:59,490
Freddy is just like standing there.

4468
03:08:59,670 --> 03:09:01,050
And it's like...

4469
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:04,130
He's like sniffing Ducktectin.

4470
03:09:05,970 --> 03:09:06,730
Okay.

4471
03:09:07,190 --> 03:09:08,410
Blank is Toby's blank.

4472
03:09:08,570 --> 03:09:10,590
Because she had a...

4473
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:15,260
I think it's...

4474
03:09:15,820 --> 03:09:17,880
I think it's Theodore is Toby's...

4475
03:09:19,880 --> 03:09:20,640
Parent.

4476
03:09:22,180 --> 03:09:23,860
A fling...

4477
03:09:24,240 --> 03:09:24,800
With...

4478
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:26,040
Wait.

4479
03:09:27,200 --> 03:09:28,320
Because...

4480
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:31,000
They had a fling with Matilda...

4481
03:09:31,180 --> 03:09:32,320
In the military.

4482
03:09:44,420 --> 03:09:48,720
Oh my god!

4483
03:09:51,400 --> 03:09:52,700
Scandals everywhere!

4484
03:09:52,900 --> 03:09:54,360
Time to confront the culprit!

4485
03:09:54,740 --> 03:09:55,400
Oh my god!

4486
03:09:55,400 --> 03:09:57,920
I had a feeling this won't be pleasant for Fredderson.

4487
03:09:58,720 --> 03:09:59,800
Aw, Freddy.

4488
03:10:00,480 --> 03:10:01,800
Freddy Fredderson.

4489
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:02,620
What is this about?

4490
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,620
Does the doc want to waste our time again?

4491
03:10:06,020 --> 03:10:07,880
This better be important.

4492
03:10:08,520 --> 03:10:10,400
Okay, it's time for the Ace Attorney.

4493
03:10:11,820 --> 03:10:15,280
I know we're in an unusual situation.

4494
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:16,820
We're gonna call everybody out.

4495
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:19,980
I would appreciate it if...

4496
03:10:19,980 --> 03:10:22,100
They will stop calling for random meetings!

4497
03:10:22,580 --> 03:10:25,820
This one is important, I promise.

4498
03:10:26,180 --> 03:10:27,360
Where did Toby go?

4499
03:10:27,560 --> 03:10:29,660
What if that capybara took him?

4500
03:10:29,660 --> 03:10:31,140
I will get to that.

4501
03:10:31,340 --> 03:10:33,740
First, let me explain what happened.

4502
03:10:34,100 --> 03:10:34,120
Look at their stance!

4503
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:36,380
Oh wait, I'm sorry, I was walking there.

4504
03:10:36,380 --> 03:10:43,860
As a high-ranking officer in the East Canton Army, Matilda Eisenbaum has access to classified information.

4505
03:10:43,860 --> 03:10:48,880
She was entrusted with the physical plans for a new military base.

4506
03:10:49,660 --> 03:10:58,140
Meanwhile, Katya Ray has been meticulously preparing her master plan to steal these documents.

4507
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:05,460
She found out that Matilda is a huge fan of the Chess Kid.

4508
03:11:05,960 --> 03:11:09,240
Which prompted her to become Arnaud's assistant.

4509
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:14,200
What Arnaud didn't realize was that Katya was actually...

4510
03:11:14,200 --> 03:11:16,240
Actually a spy!

4511
03:11:16,980 --> 03:11:18,100
For West Canton!

4512
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:19,360
Oh my god!

4513
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:20,860
By using Arnaud's social medias...

4514
03:11:20,860 --> 03:11:21,140
By using Arnaud's social medias...

4515
03:11:21,140 --> 03:11:23,040
...that she got close to Matilda...

4516
03:11:23,040 --> 03:11:23,780
...knowledge about...

4517
03:11:23,780 --> 03:11:26,040
...and made her trust Arnaud enough...

4518
03:11:26,040 --> 03:11:29,360
...to agree to a secret transfer of the documents...

4519
03:11:29,360 --> 03:11:33,680
...in hopes of getting special, personal photos of Arnaud.

4520
03:11:33,680 --> 03:11:34,420
Uh-huh!

4521
03:11:35,180 --> 03:11:35,900
Unfortunately for her...

4522
03:11:36,300 --> 03:11:36,840
Uh-huh!

4523
03:11:37,320 --> 03:11:38,680
I, the Duck Detective...

4524
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:42,440
...managed to find the secret hiding spot first.

4525
03:11:42,620 --> 03:11:44,100
Yeah, but it wasn't boarded anymore!

4526
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:46,940
And this secret hiding spot is...

4527
03:11:47,240 --> 03:11:48,040
Over there!

4528
03:11:48,700 --> 03:11:49,080
Right here!

4529
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:49,360
Right here!

4530
03:11:50,880 --> 03:11:52,740
In the broken toilet!

4531
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:53,400
Ba-boom!

4532
03:11:53,960 --> 03:11:54,680
Are you kidding me?

4533
03:11:55,960 --> 03:11:57,300
That's right, Katya!

4534
03:11:57,500 --> 03:11:58,840
I got here first!

4535
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:01,900
But that's not your real name, is it?

4536
03:12:02,040 --> 03:12:03,020
Yeah, Miss Sarah!

4537
03:12:03,020 --> 03:12:03,200
Sarah?

4538
03:12:03,580 --> 03:12:05,280
Sarah Blackhurst?

4539
03:12:06,640 --> 03:12:07,760
I guess...

4540
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:09,400
I can take this off now.

4541
03:12:09,840 --> 03:12:10,180
What?

4542
03:12:12,620 --> 03:12:14,680
Oh my god, it was makeup the whole...

4543
03:12:14,680 --> 03:12:14,880
Ah!

4544
03:12:18,350 --> 03:12:19,530
I don't understand...

4545
03:12:21,890 --> 03:12:23,050
Oh, they're back!

4546
03:12:23,650 --> 03:12:24,210
Mom!

4547
03:12:24,850 --> 03:12:27,250
Check out this shiny honk draw I caught!

4548
03:12:27,410 --> 03:12:28,130
Not the honk draw!

4549
03:12:28,830 --> 03:12:31,330
What did I tell you about going with strangers?

4550
03:12:32,510 --> 03:12:34,610
Oh, my little Toby!

4551
03:12:34,970 --> 03:12:35,830
You're alive!

4552
03:12:36,170 --> 03:12:37,530
I'm so glad!

4553
03:12:37,630 --> 03:12:39,170
You didn't get kidnapped by the ghost!

4554
03:12:39,390 --> 03:12:39,910
And you!

4555
03:12:40,250 --> 03:12:42,250
You kidnapped my son!

4556
03:12:42,590 --> 03:12:44,790
I knew right from the beginning!

4557
03:12:45,070 --> 03:12:46,030
Our son!

4558
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,070
You're some kind of...

4559
03:12:47,070 --> 03:12:48,230
messed up individual!

4560
03:12:49,430 --> 03:12:50,110
Actually...

4561
03:12:50,110 --> 03:12:52,710
Mom, he says he's my dad?

4562
03:12:52,710 --> 03:12:53,430
Is that...

4563
03:12:53,430 --> 03:12:54,390
Is that...

4564
03:12:54,390 --> 03:12:55,050
true?

4565
03:12:55,750 --> 03:12:56,030
What?

4566
03:12:56,550 --> 03:12:57,370
He told him?

4567
03:12:59,540 --> 03:13:00,770
It's been so long!

4568
03:13:02,550 --> 03:13:02,960
Um...

4569
03:13:03,370 --> 03:13:04,170
Oh my god!

4570
03:13:04,370 --> 03:13:04,710
Teddy?

4571
03:13:05,150 --> 03:13:06,710
When I saw his hair...

4572
03:13:07,710 --> 03:13:09,810
I had no doubt that he was...

4573
03:13:09,810 --> 03:13:09,850
Toby!

4574
03:13:10,110 --> 03:13:10,590
And Teddy!

4575
03:13:10,910 --> 03:13:11,610
You've really liked yourself, bro!

4576
03:13:11,610 --> 03:13:12,690
Oh my god, the little thing of hair!

4577
03:13:12,930 --> 03:13:14,750
Everything was revealed.

4578
03:13:15,050 --> 03:13:17,890
But who was responsible for this crime?

4579
03:13:18,230 --> 03:13:18,590
Oh my god...

4580
03:13:18,590 --> 03:13:22,970
Katya, Matilda, and Arno were all involved in some way.

4581
03:13:23,170 --> 03:13:23,790
Oh my god...

4582
03:13:23,790 --> 03:13:25,950
Katya has been invading Matilda's privacy...

4583
03:13:26,290 --> 03:13:26,730
Wait, what crime?

4584
03:13:27,010 --> 03:13:31,350
...seeking to obtain sensitive information in the name of West Canton.

4585
03:13:31,790 --> 03:13:33,470
Should she get arrested?

4586
03:13:37,770 --> 03:13:38,330
Guys...

4587
03:13:38,330 --> 03:13:39,950
They're all guilty.

4588
03:13:40,190 --> 03:13:40,590
Yeah...

4589
03:13:44,430 --> 03:13:46,330
I think we could arrest everybody.

4590
03:13:46,610 --> 03:13:47,370
I think we could...

4591
03:13:47,370 --> 03:13:47,650
Uh...

4592
03:13:47,650 --> 03:13:51,290
I don't think we actually have the legal means of doing that.

4593
03:13:52,590 --> 03:13:53,150
But...

4594
03:13:54,250 --> 03:13:55,950
I think because she...

4595
03:13:55,950 --> 03:13:59,110
She played with our little precious Freddy's heart...

4596
03:13:59,110 --> 03:13:59,750
We...

4597
03:13:59,750 --> 03:14:00,810
We arrest her!

4598
03:14:01,610 --> 03:14:03,690
She is a spy for the enemy.

4599
03:14:03,690 --> 03:14:05,790
Of course she needs to be arrested!

4600
03:14:06,130 --> 03:14:06,430
Arrested!

4601
03:14:06,470 --> 03:14:08,290
Frederson will just have to get over it.

4602
03:14:08,450 --> 03:14:08,690
Oh...

4603
03:14:08,690 --> 03:14:10,230
Well, I don't think they would stay together.

4604
03:14:10,450 --> 03:14:13,690
Matilda was ready to trade military insider secrets for racing photos.

4605
03:14:14,790 --> 03:14:16,270
Should she get arrested?

4606
03:14:16,530 --> 03:14:17,790
What is that game?

4607
03:14:18,990 --> 03:14:19,670
What's it...

4608
03:14:19,670 --> 03:14:19,990
What is it?

4609
03:14:20,090 --> 03:14:20,790
World of Tanks?

4610
03:14:21,710 --> 03:14:22,150
That...

4611
03:14:22,150 --> 03:14:25,610
They're constantly posting like actual...

4612
03:14:25,610 --> 03:14:26,150
Actual...

4613
03:14:26,970 --> 03:14:27,010
Actual...

4614
03:14:27,010 --> 03:14:27,530
Like...

4615
03:14:27,530 --> 03:14:31,170
Top secret military specs to make the tanks more accurate.

4616
03:14:32,150 --> 03:14:32,770
War Thunder?

4617
03:14:33,130 --> 03:14:33,950
Is it War Thunder?

4618
03:14:37,370 --> 03:14:39,390
This is the...

4619
03:14:41,510 --> 03:14:43,010
This is...

4620
03:14:43,010 --> 03:14:43,190
This is...

4621
03:14:43,190 --> 03:14:44,190
This is what I'm...

4622
03:14:44,190 --> 03:14:45,370
This is kind of...

4623
03:14:45,370 --> 03:14:46,350
The...

4624
03:14:46,350 --> 03:14:47,190
The...

4625
03:14:47,190 --> 03:14:47,570
The...

4626
03:14:47,570 --> 03:14:49,730
A similar situation I'm feeling...

4627
03:14:49,730 --> 03:14:51,830
To win arguments...

4628
03:14:51,830 --> 03:14:53,130
On the forums...

4629
03:14:53,130 --> 03:14:53,970
It's...

4630
03:14:53,970 --> 03:14:55,990
So funny...

4631
03:14:58,010 --> 03:15:00,410
How we could...

4632
03:15:00,410 --> 03:15:01,230
Okay...

4633
03:15:01,230 --> 03:15:02,690
She wanted the photos...

4634
03:15:02,690 --> 03:15:04,790
And she did not actually get them yet.

4635
03:15:07,430 --> 03:15:08,390
Or rather...

4636
03:15:08,390 --> 03:15:10,710
She did not give up the military secrets yet.

4637
03:15:10,710 --> 03:15:12,410
We could argue that it was...

4638
03:15:13,570 --> 03:15:14,050
Uh...

4639
03:15:14,050 --> 03:15:14,610
What's the word?

4640
03:15:17,850 --> 03:15:18,330
Uh...

4641
03:15:24,890 --> 03:15:25,370
Uh...

4642
03:15:25,370 --> 03:15:25,950
Intent!

4643
03:15:26,150 --> 03:15:26,910
Yeah, that's the word.

4644
03:15:27,030 --> 03:15:27,490
Intent.

4645
03:15:28,890 --> 03:15:30,350
Yeah, I don't like her.

4646
03:15:30,870 --> 03:15:31,350
So...

4647
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:31,810
Goodbye.

4648
03:15:32,670 --> 03:15:33,610
Goodbye, Matilda.

4649
03:15:34,310 --> 03:15:37,630
Her actions would have caused serious damage to East Kenton.

4650
03:15:37,630 --> 03:15:39,470
Steps we take to prove ourselves right to her.

4651
03:15:39,550 --> 03:15:40,570
She definitely should be arrested.

4652
03:15:41,170 --> 03:15:43,830
Arno was right at the center of the crime.

4653
03:15:44,070 --> 03:15:45,830
But failed to report it.

4654
03:15:46,430 --> 03:15:47,910
Should he be arrested?

4655
03:15:48,210 --> 03:15:49,490
Wait, sorry, what was that?

4656
03:15:49,690 --> 03:15:51,250
Oh gosh, I was reading the super chat.

4657
03:15:51,830 --> 03:15:54,390
Zero day since classified military documents.

4658
03:15:56,070 --> 03:15:56,590
Conspiracy!

4659
03:15:56,770 --> 03:15:58,350
Yeah, that's the word I was thinking of too.

4660
03:15:59,030 --> 03:15:59,970
Wait, who was...

4661
03:15:59,970 --> 03:16:00,830
Oh, Arno.

4662
03:16:01,710 --> 03:16:02,930
I don't think...

4663
03:16:02,930 --> 03:16:04,170
He didn't do anything.

4664
03:16:05,680 --> 03:16:07,850
In fact, I feel like he was...

4665
03:16:07,850 --> 03:16:09,170
His only...

4666
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:11,040
Problem was that he...

4667
03:16:11,830 --> 03:16:13,790
Oh, he failed to report the crime.

4668
03:16:14,690 --> 03:16:16,730
Did he even know what was going on?

4669
03:16:19,170 --> 03:16:21,270
Do you go to jail for being annoying?

4670
03:16:21,850 --> 03:16:24,050
I think he's the only one in the right here.

4671
03:16:24,230 --> 03:16:26,290
He wanted to leave because...

4672
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:27,550
He like...

4673
03:16:27,550 --> 03:16:27,990
His...

4674
03:16:27,990 --> 03:16:29,890
His tent got vandalized.

4675
03:16:29,930 --> 03:16:31,650
His stuff got stolen.

4676
03:16:33,650 --> 03:16:35,330
He's just a streamer.

4677
03:16:35,470 --> 03:16:36,290
They're all annoying.

4678
03:16:36,750 --> 03:16:38,310
All streamers are annoying.

4679
03:16:38,790 --> 03:16:39,830
Except my ocean.

4680
03:16:42,770 --> 03:16:44,350
Should be arrested now.

4681
03:16:45,070 --> 03:16:47,390
He had no idea what was happening.

4682
03:16:47,750 --> 03:16:50,190
I don't think there's grounds for arresting him.

4683
03:16:50,190 --> 03:16:50,670
He's biased.

4684
03:16:51,070 --> 03:16:51,330
All right.

4685
03:16:51,930 --> 03:16:53,010
I made up my mind.

4686
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:53,990
All right.

4687
03:16:53,990 --> 03:16:55,870
I will report to the state police.

4688
03:16:56,210 --> 03:16:56,650
Yes.

4689
03:16:57,230 --> 03:16:57,870
Katya.

4690
03:16:58,210 --> 03:16:58,790
Katya.

4691
03:16:59,310 --> 03:16:59,990
Matilda.

4692
03:17:00,390 --> 03:17:00,550
Yeah.

4693
03:17:01,270 --> 03:17:03,510
You're sending my girlfriend to jail?

4694
03:17:04,090 --> 03:17:04,830
Yes.

4695
03:17:04,830 --> 03:17:05,030
Yes.

4696
03:17:05,030 --> 03:17:06,610
She's a spy, Fredderson.

4697
03:17:07,810 --> 03:17:09,010
Are you...

4698
03:17:09,010 --> 03:17:09,810
Really?

4699
03:17:10,850 --> 03:17:12,330
I'm sorry, Freddy.

4700
03:17:13,010 --> 03:17:13,850
You're not so...

4701
03:17:13,850 --> 03:17:15,290
What about our...

4702
03:17:15,290 --> 03:17:15,590
Forest walks?

4703
03:17:16,610 --> 03:17:18,190
When you told me...

4704
03:17:18,750 --> 03:17:20,570
That you thought my Rubik's cubes were cool.

4705
03:17:20,730 --> 03:17:22,050
I'm so glad she's going to jail.

4706
03:17:22,630 --> 03:17:23,230
Was...

4707
03:17:23,830 --> 03:17:25,030
Everything a lie?

4708
03:17:25,770 --> 03:17:26,930
I thought that...

4709
03:17:27,390 --> 03:17:29,250
We'd tell each other everything.

4710
03:17:29,250 --> 03:17:29,490
I...

4711
03:17:30,090 --> 03:17:31,150
No, I...

4712
03:17:31,150 --> 03:17:32,310
No...

4713
03:17:32,310 --> 03:17:34,350
I enjoyed those walks too.

4714
03:17:35,690 --> 03:17:37,970
You can't separate me from my son!

4715
03:17:38,230 --> 03:17:40,630
That foul beast tricked me!

4716
03:17:40,910 --> 03:17:43,510
She impersonated the Chess King!

4717
03:17:44,050 --> 03:17:46,210
I... I'm the victim here!

4718
03:17:46,550 --> 03:17:48,190
Mom, what's happening?

4719
03:17:48,830 --> 03:17:49,910
What's happening?

4720
03:17:50,990 --> 03:17:52,110
It will all be fine.

4721
03:17:52,430 --> 03:17:54,390
Toby, soon you'll learn your...

4722
03:17:54,390 --> 03:17:55,650
Where you're from.

4723
03:17:56,190 --> 03:17:57,490
Why do you have this accent?

4724
03:17:57,570 --> 03:17:58,150
Watch the case again.

4725
03:18:00,100 --> 03:18:00,650
Oh!

4726
03:18:02,160 --> 03:18:02,710
Yeah!

4727
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:06,230
I expected...

4728
03:18:06,230 --> 03:18:07,330
Nothing less!

4729
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:10,670
This is so sad!

4730
03:18:11,490 --> 03:18:12,450
The truth...

4731
03:18:12,450 --> 03:18:13,730
The truth...

4732
03:18:13,730 --> 03:18:15,250
Is an ugly mistress.

4733
03:18:16,990 --> 03:18:19,610
Oh my god...

4734
03:18:19,780 --> 03:18:21,470
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped!

4735
03:18:21,890 --> 03:18:23,630
But it is my duty...

4736
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:26,930
To throw bread to the kind beak...

4737
03:18:26,930 --> 03:18:29,090
Of Lady Justice!

4738
03:18:29,230 --> 03:18:30,650
He's crying in the background!

4739
03:18:32,550 --> 03:18:34,930
Oh, we follow just like everybody else.

4740
03:18:35,110 --> 03:18:37,670
96% of players decided to arrest Katya.

4741
03:18:38,110 --> 03:18:40,950
74% of players decided to arrest Matilda.

4742
03:18:41,190 --> 03:18:44,510
And 22% of players decided to arrest Arnaud.

4743
03:18:54,110 --> 03:18:55,790
Katya deserved it!

4744
03:18:55,970 --> 03:18:56,930
But after seeing...

4745
03:18:56,930 --> 03:18:58,270
Poor little Freddy...

4746
03:18:59,050 --> 03:19:00,330
Sobbing like that...

4747
03:19:01,390 --> 03:19:02,730
Everyone gets arrested...

4748
03:19:02,730 --> 03:19:03,410
Except the duck...

4749
03:19:03,410 --> 03:19:04,930
Except the duck detective!

4750
03:19:07,790 --> 03:19:09,290
That was too sad!

4751
03:19:10,850 --> 03:19:12,190
Oh, that's it!

4752
03:19:13,270 --> 03:19:14,970
Wait, what's gonna happen to Freddy?

4753
03:19:17,610 --> 03:19:19,290
Do we get a...

4754
03:19:19,290 --> 03:19:19,910
Epilogue?

4755
03:19:20,270 --> 03:19:20,910
Please!

4756
03:19:25,670 --> 03:19:26,950
But maybe...

4757
03:19:26,950 --> 03:19:28,170
Maybe he'll...

4758
03:19:28,170 --> 03:19:29,050
You know...

4759
03:19:29,050 --> 03:19:30,130
I like the ghost fog...

4760
03:19:31,010 --> 03:19:33,950
Maybe he'll become a little more hardened after this, you know?

4761
03:19:41,230 --> 03:19:42,510
Maybe he'll...

4762
03:19:42,510 --> 03:19:43,570
He'll...

4763
03:19:43,570 --> 03:19:44,150
You know...

4764
03:19:44,150 --> 03:19:45,870
Be a little less happy-go-lucky...

4765
03:19:46,430 --> 03:19:47,070
Freddy...

4766
03:19:50,490 --> 03:19:51,130
Mmm...

4767
03:19:51,130 --> 03:19:52,450
There's after credits, I think?

4768
03:19:52,610 --> 03:19:53,090
Yippee!

4769
03:19:55,510 --> 03:19:56,750
Future friends!

4770
03:19:57,050 --> 03:19:57,490
Cute!

4771
03:20:02,250 --> 03:20:05,750
I wanna be one of the voice actors in one of the future games.

4772
03:20:06,470 --> 03:20:08,350
Please, happy broccoli pick-a-bee!

4773
03:20:09,550 --> 03:20:10,850
Oreo the cat!

4774
03:20:13,250 --> 03:20:14,550
Thanks for playing!

4775
03:20:14,970 --> 03:20:15,210
Yay!

4776
03:20:15,210 --> 03:20:15,310
Yay!

4777
03:20:16,210 --> 03:20:16,310
Oh!

4778
03:20:16,770 --> 03:20:18,270
Well, Frederson...

4779
03:20:18,940 --> 03:20:20,540
Don't be sad that it ended...

4780
03:20:20,790 --> 03:20:23,170
Be sad that it happened at all.

4781
03:20:25,110 --> 03:20:25,850
Wait...

4782
03:20:25,850 --> 03:20:27,070
Aren't you...

4783
03:20:27,070 --> 03:20:28,290
Eugene McQuacklin?

4784
03:20:28,970 --> 03:20:29,390
Indeed!

4785
03:20:29,810 --> 03:20:31,480
The one and only...

4786
03:20:32,010 --> 03:20:32,870
Duck detective!

4787
03:20:32,870 --> 03:20:34,950
I don't think there's gonna be a sequel...

4788
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:35,190
Great!

4789
03:20:35,570 --> 03:20:37,570
I might as well take you with me then!

4790
03:20:37,690 --> 03:20:37,990
Uh-oh!

4791
03:20:38,710 --> 03:20:39,450
You're...

4792
03:20:39,450 --> 03:20:40,430
Under arrest!

4793
03:20:46,490 --> 03:20:46,890
Wait!

4794
03:20:47,070 --> 03:20:47,870
What is happening?

4795
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:48,890
I don't think there's a sequel!

4796
03:20:48,910 --> 03:20:50,310
I wanna speak to my lawyer!

4797
03:20:52,470 --> 03:20:55,870
This is what happens when you don't make your payments, duck detective!

4798
03:20:58,730 --> 03:21:00,530
You get caught by the IRS!

4799
03:21:00,530 --> 03:21:00,670
You get caught by the IRS!

4800
03:21:04,330 --> 03:21:04,770
Oh...

4801
03:21:06,470 --> 03:21:06,910
Oh...

4802
03:21:12,180 --> 03:21:12,620
No!

4803
03:21:13,420 --> 03:21:15,760
This is why you shouldn't have called the police on any of them!

4804
03:21:15,980 --> 03:21:16,140
True!

4805
03:21:16,140 --> 03:21:16,800
Nooo!

4806
03:21:19,080 --> 03:21:21,180
Duck Detected to Duck Detainee.

4807
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:27,660
Oh, nooo!

4808
03:21:35,370 --> 03:21:40,010
Let's see if we can... if we... choose not to send any of them to jail.

4809
03:21:41,050 --> 03:21:42,390
Wait, what is this?

4810
03:21:44,030 --> 03:21:46,090
Oh, we have to go through the whole thing again.

4811
03:21:46,590 --> 03:21:47,450
Ah, it's okay then.

4812
03:21:51,610 --> 03:21:53,990
No ghost was arrested in this episode.

4813
03:21:54,830 --> 03:21:59,150
I felt this one was much... easier than the first one.

4814
03:21:59,290 --> 03:22:01,310
I remember struggling a little bit on some of the...

4815
03:22:01,870 --> 03:22:03,450
some of the things in the first one.

4816
03:22:03,550 --> 03:22:05,370
But this one was much easier to solve.

4817
03:22:07,090 --> 03:22:08,430
It is a funny game!

4818
03:22:08,930 --> 03:22:10,310
The characters are so silly.

4819
03:22:13,430 --> 03:22:13,950
Yeah!

4820
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:18,990
What is unstuck?

4821
03:22:19,410 --> 03:22:20,290
I don't know.

4822
03:22:20,630 --> 03:22:21,150
Let's see.

4823
03:22:32,650 --> 03:22:33,790
Nothing happened.

4824
03:22:34,710 --> 03:22:35,390
Mysterious.

4825
03:22:38,670 --> 03:22:41,050
Yeah, the VA work is so good, right?

4826
03:22:41,050 --> 03:22:41,330
I...

4827
03:22:41,850 --> 03:22:44,010
I love Duck Detectives' voice.

4828
03:22:46,610 --> 03:22:48,050
Oh, if you get stuck on...

4829
03:22:48,750 --> 03:22:49,430
...geometry.

4830
03:22:51,430 --> 03:22:52,790
For glitches.

4831
03:22:55,530 --> 03:22:56,990
I see, I see, I see.

4832
03:22:57,350 --> 03:22:58,210
It was really fun.

4833
03:22:58,350 --> 03:22:59,730
Great job...

4834
03:22:59,730 --> 03:23:01,230
...quacking the case.

4835
03:23:02,230 --> 03:23:03,770
I quacked it, Verily.

4836
03:23:03,890 --> 03:23:04,690
I quacked it, Verily.

4837
03:23:04,690 --> 03:23:05,090
I quacked the case.

4838
03:23:06,710 --> 03:23:07,870
Justice for Freddy!

4839
03:23:09,030 --> 03:23:11,710
Wow, we'll have to see if, uh, if there's a third one.

4840
03:23:13,890 --> 03:23:17,550
Maybe, maybe, maybe it becomes, like, true Ace Attorney.

4841
03:23:17,850 --> 03:23:20,890
You know how an Ace Attorney, Maya, is always getting arrested?

4842
03:23:21,270 --> 03:23:24,750
And instead of playing as Duck Detective, you play as Freddy.

4843
03:23:27,210 --> 03:23:27,730
Maybe.

4844
03:23:28,870 --> 03:23:30,450
You quacked me up.

4845
03:23:41,180 --> 03:23:42,660
Detective Pikachu VA.

4846
03:23:42,840 --> 03:23:43,040
True!

4847
03:23:43,420 --> 03:23:44,240
So true, right?

4848
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:49,780
Yeah, I feel there were...

4849
03:23:49,780 --> 03:23:50,940
...a little less ghosts.

4850
03:23:51,120 --> 03:23:51,260
I...

4851
03:23:51,260 --> 03:23:52,060
The only thing...

4852
03:23:52,680 --> 03:23:55,000
The only thing I would want for this...

4853
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,160
...is, like, a little bit more of, like, a...

4854
03:23:57,160 --> 03:23:58,380
Is it a ghost?

4855
03:23:58,640 --> 03:23:59,320
You know?

4856
03:24:00,760 --> 03:24:01,780
...kind of scenes.

4857
03:24:01,980 --> 03:24:02,420
Like, oh!

4858
03:24:02,740 --> 03:24:03,780
This is a little...

4859
03:24:03,780 --> 03:24:06,300
This seems paranormal, but it's not really, you know?

4860
03:24:10,060 --> 03:24:10,980
But that's okay.

4861
03:24:11,560 --> 03:24:13,420
I'm all the paranormal you need!

4862
03:24:17,060 --> 03:24:17,500
Ah.

4863
03:24:22,090 --> 03:24:26,990
I'm struggling in grad school, but today I managed to run an experiment all by myself, mostly!

4864
03:24:27,870 --> 03:24:31,010
Thank you for always being in my head, Minto, especially when it gets tough.

4865
03:24:31,010 --> 03:24:33,310
I'm going in next week when I break something!

4866
03:24:33,730 --> 03:24:34,230
Yeah!

4867
03:24:34,990 --> 03:24:35,630
Congratulations!

4868
03:24:37,390 --> 03:24:38,730
You're so smart!

4869
03:24:40,410 --> 03:24:41,330
You did it!

4870
03:24:41,490 --> 03:24:43,170
And you can keep doing it!

4871
03:24:44,670 --> 03:24:45,090
Yeah!

4872
03:24:48,710 --> 03:24:50,010
Good job, Finn!

4873
03:24:53,150 --> 03:24:54,930
Thank you, I'm not smart.

4874
03:24:54,930 --> 03:24:56,590
Well, you're smarter than me.

4875
03:24:58,530 --> 03:25:00,250
I'm not in grad school.

4876
03:25:00,250 --> 03:25:02,370
I became a streamer!

4877
03:25:06,870 --> 03:25:10,410
I convinced my co-workers to go on a ghost tour during our retreat.

4878
03:25:11,610 --> 03:25:12,090
What?

4879
03:25:12,270 --> 03:25:13,110
That's awesome!

4880
03:25:13,570 --> 03:25:14,930
I want to go on a ghost tour!

4881
03:25:15,590 --> 03:25:18,310
And then I could haunt the people that are on the tour!

4882
03:25:19,570 --> 03:25:24,710
Get them some real good evidence and they'll be like, This place is definitely haunted!

4883
03:25:28,890 --> 03:25:31,130
Streaming is a valuable community service.

4884
03:25:33,070 --> 03:25:35,310
Happy to do my part for the community?

4885
03:25:38,950 --> 03:25:40,990
The ghost tour is St. Augustine.

4886
03:25:41,090 --> 03:25:42,350
I want to go there!

4887
03:25:42,610 --> 03:25:44,090
They have like, the castles and stuff.

4888
03:25:44,850 --> 03:25:45,610
Not castles.

4889
03:25:45,790 --> 03:25:46,530
Like, the forts.

4890
03:25:53,770 --> 03:25:54,910
But this was fun!

4891
03:25:55,710 --> 03:25:56,730
This was a good...

4892
03:25:56,730 --> 03:25:57,130
This was...

4893
03:25:57,130 --> 03:25:57,870
This was great!

4894
03:25:58,130 --> 03:25:58,730
Duck Detective!

4895
03:25:59,710 --> 03:26:01,110
I hope there is a third one.

4896
03:26:01,290 --> 03:26:02,730
And if there is, I will play it.

4897
03:26:03,690 --> 03:26:04,770
But thank you, guys!

4898
03:26:06,450 --> 03:26:08,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4899
03:26:09,210 --> 03:26:11,290
They're fun to check out with the cannons.

4900
03:26:13,250 --> 03:26:13,850
Cool!

4901
03:26:14,850 --> 03:26:15,970
Cool, cool, cool!

4902
03:26:18,500 --> 03:26:19,100
Yeah!

4903
03:26:19,400 --> 03:26:20,660
She's so smart!

4904
03:26:21,500 --> 03:26:22,220
Call me!

4905
03:26:26,120 --> 03:26:26,720
Brains!

4906
03:26:34,260 --> 03:26:35,400
Thank you, guys!

4907
03:26:35,400 --> 03:26:36,940
Thank you, thank you!

4908
03:26:37,220 --> 03:26:39,080
Let's see if there's anybody...

4909
03:26:39,820 --> 03:26:41,120
Who can I...

4910
03:26:41,120 --> 03:26:43,300
Is there anybody that I can redirect to?

4911
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:45,880
I got so many redirects today.

4912
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:49,280
Mataracon is playing Day of the Diver.

4913
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:50,280
And I love that game, too.

4914
03:26:50,480 --> 03:26:52,820
So, we will raid to her.

4915
03:26:53,920 --> 03:26:54,740
Otumito, everybody!

4916
03:26:55,020 --> 03:26:55,760
Thank you so much!

4917
03:26:55,940 --> 03:26:57,260
Have a good day!

4918
03:26:57,420 --> 03:26:58,320
Have a good night!

4919
03:26:58,940 --> 03:26:59,420
Um...

4920
03:26:59,420 --> 03:26:59,900
Hydrate!

4921
03:27:00,500 --> 03:27:01,480
Hydrate, hydrate!

4922
03:27:01,680 --> 03:27:04,380
And don't be a spy for the enemy company.

4923
03:27:04,380 --> 03:27:06,480
The country...

4924
03:27:10,240 --> 03:27:11,720
Or you might...

4925
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:12,460
Or you could...

4926
03:27:12,460 --> 03:27:12,700
Whatever!

4927
03:27:13,100 --> 03:27:13,980
Do whatever you want!

4928
03:27:14,380 --> 03:27:15,020
Hahahaha!

4929
03:27:15,640 --> 03:27:16,200
Otumito!

4930
03:27:16,200 --> 03:27:17,180
I'll see you soon!

4931
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:18,280
I'll see you soon!

4932
03:27:18,300 --> 03:27:19,260
Bye bye!

4933
03:27:20,240 --> 03:27:20,860
Bye bye!

4934
03:27:20,860 --> 03:27:21,080
Bye bye!
