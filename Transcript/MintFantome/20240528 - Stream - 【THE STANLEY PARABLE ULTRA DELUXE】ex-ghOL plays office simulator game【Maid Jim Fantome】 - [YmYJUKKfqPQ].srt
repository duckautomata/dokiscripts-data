1
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,400
Yes, sir.

2
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,100
Yes, sir.

3
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,900
Yeah, I'll get that paperwork to you right away today, sir.

4
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,300
Yep, on your desk.

5
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,780
By 5.50 today, alright?

6
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Yes, sir.

7
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,300
Yes, sir.

8
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,220
Hello?

9
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:08,820
Whoa!

10
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,540
Why does this keep happening?

11
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Stop!

12
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,700
Stop!

13
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,040
Stop!

14
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,140
Yes, sir.

15
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,920
Yes.

16
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,260
Who was I talking to?

17
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,540
Yes.

18
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,340
I'm working on finishing that right now.

19
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,460
Don't worry about it.

20
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,540
Yes, I'm gonna finish it right now.

21
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,020
What do you mean?

22
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:46,300
What do you mean that I was supposed to have it be double-spaced?

23
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
Everything?

24
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,280
Okay, I'll redo it.

25
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
Yes, sir.

26
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,620
Oh, you wanted this in this font?

27
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,080
Okay, I'll redo the whole presentation.

28
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,640
Yes, sir.

29
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,980
Yes, sir.

30
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,620
Hello?

31
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Hello?

32
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,820
Yes, thank you for calling.

33
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
How can I help you?

34
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,100
How may I direct your call?

35
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,460
Oh, you wanna talk to Mr. Mancini?

36
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,260
He's not in the office right now.

37
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,120
Do you want this call?

38
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,600
No.

39
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,220
He's busy.

40
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,500
He's in a meeting.

41
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,460
I know I just said he wasn't in the office.

42
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,280
He's actually in a meeting.

43
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
Yeah, it's probably gonna take all day.

44
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,200
You know, so...

45
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,780
Yup.

46
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,840
Can I take a message?

47
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,380
Hemorrhoid cream ready.

48
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, you want this call?

49
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,700
Okay, let me page you through.

50
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,620
Hello?

51
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,060
Hello?

52
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,800
Yes.

53
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,480
Yes, how can I help you?

54
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,580
Welcome to the company.

55
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,460
Oh, you have a meeting with Mr. Mancini?

56
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,860
He's quite busy.

57
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,400
I believe.

58
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,960
Are you scheduled today?

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,540
No?

60
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Hmm... I don't think I can pen you in.

61
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Hmm...

62
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:08,880
Okay.

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,040
Is this the stream?

64
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,280
Yeah, this is the stream.

65
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,880
Do I have any openings?

66
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,800
Hmm... we're booked, like, basically the rest of the year.

67
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,000
You know?

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,420
So...

69
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,220
So, can you stop making me depressed with this roleplay?

70
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,600
Welcome back, Master and Princess!

71
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,360
Hello everybody!

72
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,040
Oh my gosh, David too!

73
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,300
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

74
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,380
Thank you so much!

75
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,880
Thank you!

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,700
Welcome to the Stanley Parable!

77
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,800
Ultra deluxe, baby!

78
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,760
Ultra deluxe.

79
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
Um...

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,020
Yeah.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,620
Uh...

82
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,460
I'm... Oh my god, just hearing all of this...

83
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,540
Actually, you know, my office never sounded so bustling before.

84
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,960
I never worked in like a huge, big company.

85
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,700
Where like...

86
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,900
There's so many people.

87
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,840
And everybody's like doing some crazy thing, you know?

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,240
So busted.

89
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,940
No, I said bustling!

90
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
I said bustling.

91
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,700
I'm here for a meeting with a Miss Mint Phantom.

92
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,920
Do you happen to know where she is?

93
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,900
She's not in the office today.

94
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,380
She's on vacation indefinitely.

95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,060
So, you know...

96
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,880
But I could probably pen you in for next week.

97
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,220
You might just come back and then I'll tell you the same thing next week.

98
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,860
Depressed OLs are my thing.

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,240
Do you like seeing me like this?

100
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,060
Do you like seeing...

101
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,200
Does this get you going?

102
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,260
Yes?

103
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Yeah?

104
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,480
Kinda hot.

105
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,340
Okay, we're...

106
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,580
You know what?

107
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,060
We're just gonna...

108
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,920
We're just gonna throw that out there.

109
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,080
We're just gonna...

110
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,800
Anyway, welcome guys to the Stanley Parable.

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,080
Sorry, I'm a little out of it because I just got back from running some errands.

112
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,580
So, I made dinner really, really fast.

113
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,320
And then I ate it really, really fast.

114
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,260
So, in my brain, I'm just like...

115
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,040
Thank you for the spookies!

116
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,400
Oh my god!

117
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,320
They didn't charge us for the truck in the parking lot, so I wanted to set that right.

118
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,140
Wait, what?

119
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
I had an absolute blast out there.

120
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh my god!

121
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,620
Thanks for going!

122
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,920
But...

123
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,180
This is...

124
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,500
You are playing the Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.

125
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,420
I...

126
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,240
Full disclosure, I have played this game before.

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,700
But it was some time ago.

128
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,920
And I don't quite remember a lot.

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
And also, I never got to finish the game.

130
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,680
Because my...

131
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,140
My...

132
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,320
Game crashed!

133
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,120
So, I never truly finished the game.

134
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,280
So...

135
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,560
It will be...

136
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,500
It will be...

137
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,780
Newish...

138
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,100
Experience, I think.

139
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,880
Blizzard!

140
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,540
Jesus!

141
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,180
Hey, Zeus!

142
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,040
Lizard...

143
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,520
Lizard!

144
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,440
Lizard!

145
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,180
Welcome!

146
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,160
And Jacob, welcome!

147
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
And Jacob, thanks for the 10 gifted!

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,300
Unironically, yes.

149
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,840
Please, get some help.

150
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
If seeing...

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,560
If seeing depressed OL is your thing...

152
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Get some help.

153
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,600
Get some help.

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
It won't crash this time.

155
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
Perfect stream incoming.

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,320
Yippee!

157
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,320
HR called.

158
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,960
The shredder under the complaint box is jammed.

159
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,020
Could you send custodial to clear it?

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,520
The shredder under the complaint box.

161
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,700
No kink shaming, boss.

162
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,720
You're right, you're right.

163
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,040
Sorry.

164
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,740
Sorry.

165
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,440
You're so right.

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Welcome to membership.

167
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,040
Thank you!

168
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,660
But seeing depressed snake is your thing?

169
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,360
No!

170
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,380
I don't like seeing him depressed.

171
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,640
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,860
Hey, I was told you could validate my parking.

173
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,540
Oh...

174
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,560
We only validate parking on leap years, so...

175
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,960
Better luck...

176
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,160
Better luck next time.

177
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,840
Welcome to membership.

178
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,060
Going to work extra hard next month.

179
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,280
And creating a mint phantom themed piece of wax candle.

180
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,920
Oh, I want that!

181
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,120
It's a leap...

182
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,860
It's a leap year?

183
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,140
You're right!

184
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,600
Sorry, I meant every...

185
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,580
Every...

186
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,340
Sorry, I was thinking of our company parties.

187
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,240
They're done on leap years.

188
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry, what I was thinking was we only do them once a century.

189
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,260
Oh, I see.

190
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,060
So, uh...

191
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,500
And that was like at the beginning of the century.

192
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
The turn of the century.

193
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,360
So, uh...

194
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,780
You might want to like come back in a couple years, you know?

195
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
And then we'll try and validate it for you.

196
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
We got in the broom closet ending.

197
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,520
The broom closet ending is my favorite.

198
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,720
I believe I did before.

199
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,080
But of course we can get things again.

200
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,020
You got those photos printed?

201
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,900
Bocos binted?

202
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,860
You got a hundred page review of Nacho Libre on my desk by EOD?

203
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,380
Raymac, you weren't even there!

204
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,680
You weren't even there!

205
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,660
I don't want to hear it from you.

206
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,740
I did...

207
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,560
I did my report.

208
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,780
You just weren't there to see it.

209
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,760
Anyway, let's begin the game, baby.

210
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,360
No way, the call out?

211
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,260
You're next, RySat.

212
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,000
This is the story of a man named Zane.

213
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,800
Mint.

214
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,240
Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427.

215
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,140
Employee number 427's job was simple.

216
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,420
He sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.

217
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:40,620
Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.

218
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,480
This is what employee 427 did every day.

219
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,380
Every day of every month of every year.

220
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,900
And although others might have considered it soul-wrenching, Stanley relished every moment of his life.

221
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,740
The music is so funky.

222
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,920
It's like giving me Simpsons a little bit.

223
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,580
I don't know why.

224
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,800
As though he had been made exactly for this job.

225
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,020
And Stanley was happy.

226
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,680
He was happy!

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,740
And then one day, something very peculiar happened.

228
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,640
Something that would forever change Stanley.

229
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Something he would never quite forget.

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,460
He had been at his desk...

231
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,020
High order!

232
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,880
When he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.

233
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,200
Sorry, Ted.

234
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,900
For real, for real.

235
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,120
No one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say hi.

236
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,820
No.

237
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,280
Never in all his years at the company had this happened.

238
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,220
This complete isolation.

239
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,160
Something was very clearly wrong.

240
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,700
Wrong!

241
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,480
Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.

242
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,640
But as he came to his wits and regained his senses...

243
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,440
Sentience.

244
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,220
He got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

245
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,120
You can't tell me what to do, mister.

246
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,080
You inspired me to play through all of Metal Gear Solid games.

247
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,520
Let's go!

248
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm on three now and loving every second of it.

249
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm so glad!

250
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,560
Oh my god.

251
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,880
Thank you for that.

252
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,900
Okay, thank you.

253
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,440
What if I don't want to leave my office?

254
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,980
What if I want to have a...

255
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,800
I hate Monday's coffee.

256
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,020
It's 10 AM.

257
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,780
Early morning.

258
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,700
It was a matter of principle.

259
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,340
He wanted to click it.

260
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
Close the door.

261
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,820
But Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure.

262
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,360
The pressure!

263
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,680
What if he had to make a decision?

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,680
What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility?

265
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,860
He had never been trained for that.

266
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,360
No.

267
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,260
This couldn't go any way except badly.

268
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,760
The thing to do now, Stanley thought to himself, is to wait.

269
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,400
Is to wait.

270
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,380
Nothing will hurt me.

271
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,820
Yeah.

272
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,940
Nothing will break me.

273
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,680
Oh wait, there's...

274
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,880
Okay, shut up!

275
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,580
Forever.

276
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,320
Shut up!

277
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm supposed to be doing the commentary!

278
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,560
Stop!

279
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,200
Stop!

280
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,880
Oh my god, please!

281
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,920
Okay, shut up.

282
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,740
Oh.

283
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,260
Uh oh.

284
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,960
Oh no!

285
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,880
He no longer had the ability to tell.

286
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,220
But the one thing he knew for sure beyond any doubt...

287
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,000
He won't shut up!

288
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,420
The voices!

289
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,240
...was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.

290
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,160
Eventually, someday, they would arrive.

291
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,840
Soon, very soon now, this will end.

292
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
He will be spoken to.

293
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,140
Oh my god.

294
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,860
He will be told what to do.

295
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,580
You're speaking too much!

296
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,060
Now it's just a little bit closer.

297
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,380
The walls are closing in.

298
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,140
Now it's even closer.

299
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,380
Here it comes.

300
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,920
The end is never the end is never the end is never the end.

301
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,240
No, I was reading this.

302
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,840
The G814 partition corp.

303
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,840
Providing partitions for 56 years.

304
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,820
Wowee.

305
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,220
Who knew that we needed partitions for so long?

306
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,060
The phone makes a strange sound.

307
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,200
Oh.

308
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,320
Why is that to the...

309
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,900
To the picture frame?

310
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,000
What the...

311
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,460
I hear typing sounds everywhere.

312
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,280
No matter what I look at.

313
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Love the new suit.

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,860
Thank you!

315
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,220
Thank you!

316
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,960
The narrator is the commentary.

317
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,600
She finally left us to go back to the office.

318
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,680
Make the partition.

319
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,400
Nothing.

320
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,460
Nothing.

321
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,900
My friend!

322
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,580
My friend!

323
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,280
428 doesn't even give it a window.

324
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,240
They hate him.

325
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,060
All his co-workers were gone.

326
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
What could it mean?

327
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,860
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

328
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,660
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

329
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,100
Yeah, of course.

330
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
It's a memorial day!

331
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,720
Duh!

332
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,480
This is the automated cleaner invoice.

333
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,920
Your crimson entrance at WrestleTuber has now been dealt with.

334
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,240
No further actions needed.

335
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
Thank you.

336
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,900
No matter how hard Stanley looked, he couldn't find a trace of his co-workers.

337
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
Who farted?

338
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,460
Why are there mugs like this?

339
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,120
We have an order.

340
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,400
Oh, wait.

341
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,460
He has already found a case!

342
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,380
S-s-so sorry!

343
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,540
Oh, it's all right.

344
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,800
I have to do it over again.

345
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,460
Of course!

346
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,700
I can't walk!

347
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,620
Just step up!

348
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,600
Step up, you son of a...

349
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,380
No, no, no, no!

350
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,360
That's so bad.

351
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,580
Won't your boss see that?

352
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,360
Rip number one, dad.

353
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,860
Turn off all their computers.

354
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,740
Wait!

355
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,360
Where's that go?

356
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,720
Hmm, okay, thank you.

357
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,100
Thanks for the five gifted speedy fire.

358
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,680
Forgot how sassy.

359
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,220
Shut up!

360
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Why can't I explore?

361
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,100
Vodgang here, thank you!

362
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,620
I cancelled his illegal movie download.

363
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,940
Justice.

364
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,260
This guy escaped.

365
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,920
417 is in the ceiling.

366
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,940
I hate my days.

367
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,580
Okay.

368
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,320
This is the meeting room.

369
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,000
Just kidding.

370
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,440
Oh.

371
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,080
Oh no!

372
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,860
Oh no, it's this!

373
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,740
It's this, it's this, it's this!

374
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,340
Hmm.

375
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,700
Am I a good girl?

376
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,500
Am I a good Stanley or am I bad Stanley?

377
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,140
Hmm.

378
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,980
It's the choice.

379
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,800
Am I a good girl or am I a bad girl?

380
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,580
Bad Stanley.

381
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,080
Oh, my eyes.

382
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,940
Always a good Stanley.

383
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,160
Even if I don't, even if I lose my way?

384
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
This was not the correct way to the meeting room.

385
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,480
And Stanley knew it perfectly well.

386
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,640
Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first.

387
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,020
Just to admire it.

388
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,280
Of course, of course.

389
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,860
Oh, I see.

390
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,120
I want to go in there.

391
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,800
I want to go back there.

392
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,020
Hmm.

393
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,440
Oh, here we go.

394
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,220
The lounge.

395
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes.

396
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,440
Truly a room worth admiring.

397
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,040
Oh, yes.

398
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
It had really been worth the detour after all.

399
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,360
Just to spend a few moments here in this immaculate, beautifully constructed room.

400
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,720
Stanley simply stood here, drinking it all in.

401
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,500
Ah.

402
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,420
Smells like, smells like yesterday's perfume.

403
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,440
Really, really worth it being here in the room.

404
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:25,900
A room so utterly captivating that even though all your co-workers have mysteriously vanished, here you sit looking at these chairs and some paintings.

405
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,460
Really worth it.

406
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,160
It is.

407
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,360
Just love that, like that 10 a.m.

408
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,700
At this point, Stanley's obsession with this room...

409
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,440
I can't get it worded.

410
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,500
...and reflected poorly on his overall personality.

411
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,060
It's possible that this is why everyone left.

412
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,520
Now you're judging my character?

413
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,640
125 for drinks is pretty good.

414
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,020
I don't know.

415
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,860
Stanley sat around waiting for more dialogue.

416
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,560
I think it should be free.

417
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,340
But when a long time had passed and there was no more, he decided that the game was trying to send him a message.

418
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,720
Yeah, look, you got your, you got, this is where I always sit.

419
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,840
They say this is Stan's seat.

420
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,840
That's what it says.

421
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,880
You can't see it, but it's written right there.

422
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,200
There's also, they got the stain out pretty good.

423
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,740
That's, they say that's Stan's seat.

424
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,400
And then this, this is, this is big old Joe's seat.

425
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,220
You know, he's just a, he's like the biggest guy you'll ever meet.

426
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,280
What is this actually?

427
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,000
What is it?

428
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,040
Wait.

429
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:32,960
What?

430
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,220
What is?

431
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,560
What?

432
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,800
Is?

433
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,320
If?

434
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Duet the plane.

435
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,180
The weeks?

436
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,700
Hi, I'm hungry.

437
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Is that what it says at the bottom?

438
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,900
Time to zoom.

439
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,840
I can't zoom.

440
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,760
Is there a zoom button?

441
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,340
Is there a zoom?

442
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
You can look closer.

443
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,880
How do I do that?

444
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,980
Also, if I press right click, I move.

445
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,640
Move forward too.

446
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,500
That's kind of crazy.

447
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,500
See?

448
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,380
Oh, right click makes me walk forward.

449
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,980
Let's check the key binds real quick.

450
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,720
Oh, it's auto walk.

451
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,980
Okay.

452
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,380
There is a jump.

453
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,600
Interesting.

454
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,900
Interact.

455
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,780
Maybe additional.

456
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,600
Interact.

457
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,640
Interact.

458
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,620
Okay.

459
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,160
But at last, he'd had enough of the amazing room and took the first open door on his left to get back to business.

460
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,120
Look, I'm auto walking.

461
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,940
I'm auto...

462
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,340
You can't tell the difference, but I am.

463
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,480
Okay.

464
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,260
Let's all guess.

465
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,280
Wait.

466
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,800
What did he say?

467
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,800
Uh-oh.

468
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,820
I didn't hear him.

469
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:49,860
Okay.

470
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,680
Let's tell...

471
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
See if you can tell the difference.

472
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,740
Am I auto walking or am I walking walking?

473
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,830
He wants me to go this way.

474
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,710
Oh, okay.

475
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,600
And so he detoured through the maintenance section, walked straight ahead to the opposite door...

476
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:14,960
Oh, no!

477
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
... and got back on track.

478
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:16,980
Wait.

479
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,700
What's here?

480
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,260
Beep!

481
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,800
What is this?

482
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,000
But Stanley didn't want to go back to the office.

483
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,280
No!

484
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,680
He wanted to wander about and get even further off track.

485
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,520
So now in order to get back, he needed to go, um...

486
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,340
Uh...

487
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,340
Well...

488
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,520
Uh...

489
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,960
Do do do do do do!

490
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,120
Do do do do do!

491
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,600
From here it's, um...

492
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Left.

493
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,520
Oh.

494
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,100
That's nice.

495
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,140
Oh.

496
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,380
This is a fake door.

497
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,600
It doesn't even interact.

498
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,560
Oh, no!

499
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,160
No.

500
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,900
It's to the right.

501
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,240
My mistake.

502
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,820
Oh, narrator!

503
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,800
Oh, narrator!

504
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,680
You don't want to get on my...

505
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:58,980
No!

506
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,460
No.

507
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,880
No, no.

508
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,620
Not the right.

509
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,500
Why would I have ever said it was to the right?

510
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,820
What was I thinking?

511
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,080
You don't want to get on my bad side!

512
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,520
It's clearly...

513
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,660
It's clearly...

514
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,480
Am I stuck here?

515
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,460
Am I stuck here?

516
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,760
Just take me back up.

517
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
He's got it.

518
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,500
We're fine.

519
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,400
This way.

520
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,840
Is someone in there?

521
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,680
It's kind of spooky down here though, you guys.

522
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,360
Oh, wait.

523
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,040
Oh my gosh.

524
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,600
Oh, I remember this room.

525
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,140
Fired.

526
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,500
That's not me.

527
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,460
Oopsie.

528
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,560
Oh, sorry.

529
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,780
I'm closing.

530
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,360
I went to the spoiler reversing.

531
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,940
Uh-oh.

532
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,700
Uh...

533
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,720
Mister...

534
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm gonna look at the spoilers.

535
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,920
Okay.

536
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,700
We're good, Stanley.

537
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm walking... I'm bee-lining it there, Mr. Narrator.

538
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,260
Don't worry about it.

539
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,360
Uh-oh.

540
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,000
Uh-oh.

541
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,860
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

542
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,920
Uh-oh.

543
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,580
I bugged the game.

544
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,620
No.

545
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,380
I didn't touch it.

546
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,040
I didn't touch it.

547
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,140
No, just let me...

548
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,280
Oh, this is what happens when you're British.

549
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,040
British brain.

550
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,420
Okay, then.

551
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
It's an adventure.

552
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,340
Come, Stanley.

553
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,720
Let's find the story.

554
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,340
These look connected.

555
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,120
They are.

556
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,540
These go different ways.

557
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,540
Let's go this way.

558
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,400
Okay, I'm exploring.

559
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,340
Inner guilt.

560
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,540
Everyone knows what you did.

561
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,960
They're just holding back to let you tortured.

562
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,460
This is the worst adventure I've ever been on.

563
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,020
I can promise you there definitely was a story here before.

564
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,940
Are you sure?

565
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,380
Do we need to restart the game again?

566
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:48,840
No.

567
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,120
I find it unlikely that we'll ever progress by starting over and over again.

568
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,860
I'm in the back room for real, though.

569
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,980
Wait a second.

570
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,460
Oh, come on.

571
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,360
No.

572
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,830
All of his co-workers were gone.

573
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,050
What could it mean?

574
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,650
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

575
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,170
I just hate my boss.

576
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,670
Okay, bee-lining, bee-lining, bee-lining.

577
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,090
And there's no doors!

578
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,110
Okay, it's worse.

579
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,190
I might be remembering this wrong.

580
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,090
It's possible the story is back where we just came from.

581
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,090
What are you talking about?

582
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,950
Why don't we go back the other direction and see if we missed anything?

583
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,650
Okay.

584
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,890
In this room.

585
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,190
In this room.

586
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,610
415.

587
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,890
Never liked that guy.

588
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,410
417.

589
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,590
It's definitely in the walls.

590
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,490
In here, in here, in here.

591
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,650
That looks so important in there.

592
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,910
Okay, never mind.

593
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,510
Um...

594
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,390
In here.

595
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,370
No.

596
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,210
Aha!

597
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,570
I knew we'd miss something.

598
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,150
The story.

599
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,730
Here it comes.

600
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,730
Okay.

601
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,590
No, wait.

602
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,430
Never mind.

603
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,290
Not the story.

604
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,570
Okay, let's head back the other way.

605
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,130
And retrace our steps.

606
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,710
That's what I just did.

607
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,590
Mr. Narrator!

608
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,730
Mr. Narrator!

609
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,870
Oh my god, Mr. Narrator's...

610
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,750
Now this...

611
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,750
Well, I'll be honest.

612
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,190
I don't recognize this place at all.

613
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,510
Is this the story?

614
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,890
I don't think so.

615
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,690
I'm back...

616
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,290
I can't quite recall, but I believe my story took place in an office building.

617
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,850
Is that correct?

618
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,510
I'm back on the farm.

619
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,570
Do you remember, Stanley?

620
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,290
I don't know anything.

621
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,750
Since I've completely forgotten what we were supposed to be doing, how about this?

622
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,030
This.

623
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,110
You win!

624
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,370
Congratulations!

625
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,410
I beat the game!

626
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,450
I know you put in a lot of hard work, and it really paid off.

627
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,750
So, good job.

628
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,490
Oh!

629
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,490
Oh no.

630
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,450
I don't feel right about this at all.

631
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,090
Speedrun?

632
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,650
We both know you didn't put in any actual work for that win.

633
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,850
Some people win fair and square.

634
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,070
And this was not one of those situations.

635
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,410
Okay?

636
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,370
I'm getting weirded out by whatever this place is.

637
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,330
I don't care what might happen this time.

638
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,950
I have to restart.

639
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,850
Okay.

640
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,250
Alright, I've got a solution.

641
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,950
And to make sure we don't get lost, I've employed the help of the Stanley Parable Adventure Line.

642
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,750
Just follow the line.

643
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,090
How simple is that?

644
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,450
Okay.

645
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,590
I sure hope nothing happens with this line.

646
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,750
Oh, this way.

647
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,230
This way.

648
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,190
Okay.

649
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,050
This way, this way.

650
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,610
You see?

651
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,970
The line knows where the story is.

652
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,750
It's over in this direction.

653
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,030
Onward, Stanley!

654
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,890
To destiny!

655
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,850
To destiny!

656
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,030
Wouldn't wherever we end up be our destination?

657
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,930
Even if there's no story there?

658
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,910
Or to put it another way, is the story of your destination...

659
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
still a story?

660
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:21,730
Simply by the act of moving forward, are we implying a journey such that a destination is inevitably conjured into being via the very manifestation of the nature of life itself?

661
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,110
via the very manifestation of the nature of life itself?

662
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

663
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,370
That got a bit weird back there.

664
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,150
Well, I'd like to apologize.

665
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,010
Johnny!

666
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,370
Bravo!

667
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,390
The narrator should make the lead line into something really pretty.

668
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,030
That way it leads the...

669
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,390
Oh my...

670
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,110
Oh!

671
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,210
Oh!

672
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,050
Oh!

673
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,810
Go!

674
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:56,890
Go!

675
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,590
Go!

676
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,190
Go!

677
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:58,710
Go!

678
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,470
Yeah!

679
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,230
Pass through here...

680
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,490
Oh my god, I can't even hear myself think.

681
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,690
Oh!

682
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,770
Oh!

683
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,950
Around here...

684
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,330
Um...

685
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,790
Consul...

686
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:16,890
Consul...

687
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,550
Consul reports!

688
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,850
Employee 432 peer reviews!

689
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,930
Is that me?

690
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,250
Financial records!

691
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:26,930
Wait...

692
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,890
This way...

693
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,270
This way, right?

694
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,650
Oh,

695
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,370
thank god.

696
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:36,950
Oh, thank god.

697
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,330
Look at the what?

698
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,590
The fern?

699
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,530
The fern?

700
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,310
Stanley, this fern will be very important later in the story.

701
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,390
Make sure you study it closely and remember it carefully.

702
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,030
You won't want to miss anything.

703
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,380
Glory to the fern.

704
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,100
I got a certain ghost in my kitchen that was cute af but keeps rummaging my kitchen at night.

705
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,880
I think it's haunted.

706
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,420
What do I do?

707
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,320
It's probably best to appease those sorts of things.

708
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,680
You know?

709
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,480
Wait, what?

710
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,820
We're back at the office?

711
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,100
No, no, no.

712
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,400
You do know we're looking for the Stanley Parable, right?

713
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,180
The story?

714
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Is any of this ringing a bell?

715
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,060
I'm still going.

716
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,280
The line is my destiny.

717
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,720
Oh!

718
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,620
No way!

719
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,780
Cool school!

720
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,800
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

721
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,040
Oh, no, no, no.

722
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,680
Not again.

723
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,660
How could you have done this to us?

724
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,360
What's that one over there?

725
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,580
After everything we've been through, you...

726
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,140
Oh, I can't take this anymore.

727
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,060
Restart.

728
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,880
The line wanted spoilers.

729
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,840
Okay.

730
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,300
You know what, Stanley?

731
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,440
I say forget the adventure line.

732
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,760
What's it ever done for us?

733
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,380
We're intelligent people, right?

734
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Why can't we make up our own story?

735
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,820
Something exciting.

736
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,720
Daring.

737
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,480
Mysterious.

738
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,100
This all sounds perfectly doable.

739
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,400
Why don't we simply start wandering in...

740
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,160
Well, I don't know.

741
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,020
How about this direction?

742
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,680
This direction?

743
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,440
Well, I don't really have a choice now, do I?

744
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,240
This is exciting.

745
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,420
Just me and Stanley forging a new path.

746
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,600
This is really backrooms-esque.

747
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,300
What do you want our story to be?

748
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,700
Go wild.

749
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,240
Use your imagination.

750
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,260
I'm ready for it.

751
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,700
Okay.

752
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,800
All right.

753
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,440
Setting.

754
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,100
Dingy.

755
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,300
Dingy office.

756
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,120
They're about to go out of business.

757
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,800
They're, uh...

758
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,840
Let's see.

759
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,880
What kind of business do they do?

760
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,680
They do the real top business.

761
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,300
They're...

762
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,540
They're really business, business.

763
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,220
But they're just not doing so well because...

764
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,840
Because bigger business has moved in on their turf.

765
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,320
Bigger business has moved in on their turf.

766
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,300
And...

767
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,140
So they're just like...

768
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,960
Man, we're just...

769
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,780
I don't know if we're going to make it.

770
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,760
So the business...

771
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,840
employee is just like...

772
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,420
We can't go out of business.

773
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,200
This is my livelihood.

774
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,640
How will that feed my kids?

775
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,080
And so they're just like...

776
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,440
Well, what do you want to do about it?

777
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,520
And are they a gang?

778
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,640
Stop.

779
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,340
No spoilers.

780
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,240
And so they...

781
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,600
Yeah, Bigger Business Inc.

782
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,460
Business is business.

783
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,400
So...

784
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,200
To get...

785
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,780
To get rid of the other bigger business...

786
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,100
They thought...

787
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,980
Well, maybe we should make a better product.

788
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,360
But no.

789
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
It's not good enough.

790
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,360
Bigger business does better business.

791
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,500
Not better business.

792
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,100
They just do bigger, bigger business.

793
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
Bigger business is so big that it even covers...

794
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,200
So much of the business.

795
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,220
And so instead...

796
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,500
They have to kill them.

797
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,460
It's time to take down bigger business.

798
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,880
Bigger business...

799
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,480
Has to be eliminated.

800
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,960
And so they start...

801
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,160
They start shipping...

802
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,300
Let's see.

803
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,640
They start shipping...

804
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,500
Rats with the black...

805
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,460
Sorry.

806
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,780
I just tried to get some chapstick out.

807
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,580
And it just squirted everywhere.

808
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,990
Rats with what?

809
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,110
The black plague.

810
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,350
Did you guys know...

811
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,550
It's still possible to get the bubonic plague...

812
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,350
Nowadays?

813
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,310
I learned that the hard way.

814
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,390
Anyway.

815
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,930
I don't know where I was going with that.

816
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,450
Oh no.

817
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,430
Not you again.

818
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,290
It's being a mess.

819
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,910
I'd also like to veto the line from having any role in our awesome new story.

820
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,090
No lines or monitor rooms.

821
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,750
Just don't acknowledge it.

822
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,210
Okay.

823
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,830
I'm not going to even...

824
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,310
Look at it.

825
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,310
Guys.

826
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,490
I think I should start a business.

827
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:15,770
Hmm.

828
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,350
Spooky company.

829
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,310
Always monitoring.

830
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,730
What do we monitor?

831
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,110
You ask?

832
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,970
Every type of business.

833
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:26,830
We get to make a decision.

834
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,510
From here the story is in our control.

835
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,650
How important we mustn't squander the opportunity.

836
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,570
In fact I believe I need a minute to think here.

837
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,570
Just walk in circles for a minute.

838
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,830
Okay.

839
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,310
So I know that each door has to lead somewhere.

840
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,490
Which means that somewhere...

841
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,230
A big business government?

842
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,190
No.

843
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,510
There must be a reverse door that leads here.

844
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:49,890
No no no.

845
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,550
Spooky company always monitoring.

846
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:58,190
And that in turn means that our destination corresponds with that counter inverted reverse door's origin.

847
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:04,670
So starting from the right, let us ask, will taking the right door lead us to where we're going?

848
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:10,850
And since the answer is clearly yes, then by all accounts the door on the right is the correct one.

849
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,390
We're already making profit with this business.

850
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,210
Great job, Mint.

851
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,230
Thank you!

852
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,470
Our destiny awaits.

853
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,050
The confusion ending.

854
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,250
You've been playing this confusion ending for...

855
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:29,850
Hold up, what's this?

856
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,330
Nineteen minutes.

857
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,550
The confusion ending?

858
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,590
First restart.

859
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,850
This is just a...

860
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,870
It's all been scripted to me!

861
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,290
Eight times?

862
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,990
Find a bookstore?

863
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,430
That's really how all this goes?

864
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,190
Wait, what was the other place that we got to?

865
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,290
Nonsense, philosophy and music.

866
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,290
So now according to the schedule, I restart again.

867
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,390
No no no, hold on!

868
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,650
Am I just supposed to forget?

869
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,050
End up in another building?

870
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,750
Find the line?

871
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,590
My mind goes blank simply because it's written here on this... this thing.

872
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:03,650
Wall.

873
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:04,850
Okay.

874
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,430
Oh, it's begun to deteriorate?

875
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,610
Why don't I get to decide?

876
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,250
Why don't I get a say in all of this?

877
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,030
Is it really?

878
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,910
I think I had started investing on some spooky company always monitoring stocks.

879
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,070
Thank you!

880
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,190
I don't want to forget what's going on.

881
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,950
I don't want to be trapped like this.

882
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,730
I won't restart the game.

883
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,790
I won't do it.

884
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,930
I won't do it.

885
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,270
I won't do it.

886
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,490
Can I sit down?

887
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,770
Stopped?

888
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,230
Does that mean... did we do it?

889
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,630
Did we break the cycle?

890
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,590
Whatever it is that made this schedule.

891
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,670
How would we even know?

892
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,010
Will someone come for us?

893
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,490
Will something happen?

894
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,010
This guy loves to hear himself talk.

895
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,590
After a long time, Stanley dies!

896
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,090
Wait there, Raider!

897
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,390
I don't want to die.

898
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,930
I'm already dead.

899
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:54,930
I'm not ready.

900
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,550
I suppose in some way that this is a kind of story.

901
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,350
Wouldn't you agree?

902
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,010
I'm not quite sure if we're in the destination or the journey.

903
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,970
Though they're always saying that life is about the journey and not the destination.

904
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,690
So I hope that's where we are right now.

905
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,370
In the journey.

906
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,430
We'll find out, won't we?

907
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,250
Eventually.

908
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,410
In the meantime, if you don't...

909
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:19,810
Okay.

910
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,990
We've restarted the game, everybody.

911
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,910
All of his co-workers were gone.

912
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,970
What could it mean?

913
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,630
I think he's saying...

914
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,690
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

915
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,450
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

916
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,090
I think he's normal.

917
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,330
Are you normal, Mr. Narrator?

918
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,010
Yes!

919
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,690
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.

920
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,710
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.

921
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,150
He decided to go to the meeting room.

922
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,590
You can't tell me what to do.

923
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,850
They're like, yeah, you committed.

924
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,930
How do I know if it's his left, my left, you know?

925
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,530
Well, here's the meeting room.

926
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,070
Well, here's the meeting room.

927
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,510
Oh, tips for not getting fired.

928
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:20,290
Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go out to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.

929
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,790
Not to solve a dispute with a co-worker.

930
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,170
Let it ball up inside you.

931
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,050
Take it out passive-aggressively on other co-workers.

932
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,970
Resent co-workers for not supporting you more.

933
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,230
This feels too real.

934
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,550
Make sure your slide has a slick blue graphic in the header.

935
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,710
Make sure your slide has a slick blue graphic in the header.

936
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,190
Oh yeah.

937
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,270
Sounds legit.

938
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,770
Everyone is unique.

939
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,310
You, most of all.

940
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:42,950
Which one am I?

941
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,650
Who is me?

942
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,050
I'm Minto.

943
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,730
Stanley walking through the parable leg.

944
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,090
To do.

945
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,770
Synergize core value expenditures.

946
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,730
Gosh.

947
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,870
That is like the best thing to do on a Monday.

948
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,170
Shift global market...

949
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,690
Pa-pa-parade.

950
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,330
The parade.

951
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:05,970
The parade.

952
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,210
Oh my gosh.

953
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,590
My company.

954
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,530
We always have a global market parade.

955
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,630
It's big.

956
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,550
It's exciting.

957
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,910
We get blow-up dolls.

958
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,210
I mean.

959
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:15,750
Wait.

960
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,090
No.

961
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,550
The inflatable ones.

962
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,610
I mean like the...

963
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,670
You know what I'm talking about.

964
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,150
The ones that are floating.

965
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,290
Monetize free-to-play.

966
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,250
Love it.

967
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,670
Love it.

968
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:39,990
Love it.

969
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,750
Monetize everything.

970
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,950
Do everything for profit.

971
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:42,970
Help.

972
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,770
I'm a post-it.

973
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,850
Inflatable tube guys.

974
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,310
No.

975
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:49,870
No.

976
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,170
No.

977
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,130
The ones that like...

978
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,750
In like the parades.

979
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,530
Oh the floats.

980
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,310
Yes.

981
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,370
The floats.

982
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,350
We have floats.

983
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,410
We have floats.

984
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,670
Push for funding for...

985
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,450
R&D?

986
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,450
A new coffee machine.

987
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,030
R&D?

988
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,110
We have enough GMP for this?

989
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,110
Get Chris out of the broom closet.

990
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,130
The bloons closet.

991
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,470
Giant blow-up doll in the sky?

992
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,690
No.

993
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,210
Standardized graphs.

994
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,370
440x wide.

995
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,590
Not cost efficient.

996
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,330
Papers are too synergized.

997
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,290
Fire paper guy.

998
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,790
Oh.

999
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,130
Fire the paper guy.

1000
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,570
Oh no.

1001
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,870
Hire somebody to fire the paper synergizing guy.

1002
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,290
Who moved my desk?

1003
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:53,850
All...

1004
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,530
Scratched out.

1005
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,590
Employee.

1006
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,510
Jim.

1007
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,010
Employee Jim.

1008
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,250
Tomorrow complete today's unfinished agenda items.

1009
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,550
Write next day's agenda.

1010
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:06,270
Reflect.

1011
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,130
What else we got here?

1012
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:08,950
Meeting schedule.

1013
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:11,950
Mergers?

1014
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,170
We are broke Wednesday.

1015
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,210
It's Monday so we're on weekly targets admin.

1016
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,510
Marketing Mondays.

1017
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,890
Mintara Mondays.

1018
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,690
Wait I didn't do anything.

1019
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,610
Don't fire me.

1020
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:27,710
Oh.

1021
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,910
Paper bag friend.

1022
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,250
I don't know what to tell you man.

1023
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,290
Synergize is just you know there's a perfect blend of synergize.

1024
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,690
Oof.

1025
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,750
Who died?

1026
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,150
Do not alter without consulting whiteboard manager.

1027
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,080
Oh.

1028
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,320
By quarterly post review review.

1029
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,080
We need less reviews.

1030
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,560
402 plus 405 went to get rid of the death sport portion in the primary review schedule.

1031
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,800
But I think that's a stupid idea.

1032
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,320
More water coolers.

1033
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,120
More water cooler heaters.

1034
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,300
Charts need to be more hip.

1035
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,540
To appeal to teenage demographic.

1036
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,520
Find teenagers to put in teenage demographic.

1037
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,500
Big net?

1038
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,020
Some sort of child trap?

1039
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,060
Size of demographic.

1040
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,460
Can't read what it says.

1041
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,740
Space.

1042
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,640
Between the teenagers.

1043
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,400
Teenagers.

1044
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,260
Throw something in the idea's bin.

1045
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,840
No more bins.

1046
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,960
Trash cans.

1047
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,880
Renaming of the idea bin.

1048
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,500
Firing of me.

1049
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,980
Oh.

1050
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,720
Oh.

1051
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,980
Better safe than profit.

1052
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,900
No.

1053
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,820
Ignore that everybody.

1054
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,740
Profits are everything.

1055
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,740
Business club.

1056
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,320
Rule one.

1057
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,480
References are not all they're cracked up to be.

1058
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,180
I didn't know that there was writing behind you.

1059
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:04,640
It's so funny.

1060
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,200
Crafts about things and money.

1061
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,180
These people.

1062
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:11,920
Oh my gosh.

1063
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,630
I think I have a thing or two to learn about this place.

1064
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,710
Oh wasn't there somebody locked in here?

1065
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:24,610
The broom closet.

1066
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,990
But there was nothing here.

1067
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,170
Oh wait I remember this one.

1068
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,570
And got back on track.

1069
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,650
No.

1070
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,690
Just gonna chill in here for a bit.

1071
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:34,130
You know.

1072
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,630
Just gonna.

1073
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:36,530
There was nothing here.

1074
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,950
No choice to make.

1075
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,190
No path to follow.

1076
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,010
Just an empty broom closet.

1077
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,510
Just an empty broom closet.

1078
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,550
It's not empty though.

1079
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,170
Look at this.

1080
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,530
He is devaluing your existence.

1081
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,890
Broom and closet and bucket.

1082
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,990
It was baffling that Stanley was still just sitting in the broom closet.

1083
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,010
He wasn't even doing anything.

1084
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,270
At least if there was something to interact with he'd be justified in some way.

1085
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,230
As it is.

1086
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,670
He's literally just standing there doing sweet F.A.

1087
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,010
What's F.A.?

1088
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,370
Just a broom closet.

1089
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,150
Are you really still in the broom closet?

1090
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,010
Standing around doing nothing?

1091
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:16,850
Why?

1092
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,390
Please offer me some explanation here.

1093
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,650
I'm genuinely confused.

1094
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,370
Fudge all.

1095
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,850
Well you know there's a lot of good things.

1096
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,230
There's a lot of good qualities about every room in a building, you know?

1097
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,990
Every room should have a purpose.

1098
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,450
You don't realize there's no choice or anything in here, right?

1099
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:31,750
That's okay.

1100
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,770
I'm just admiring its value.

1101
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,370
If I'd said Stanley walked past the broom closet at least you would have had a reason for exploring it to find out.

1102
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:46,070
But it didn't even occur to me because literally this closet is of absolutely no significance to the story whatsoever.

1103
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,270
I never would have thought to mention it.

1104
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,910
Then why'd you create it?

1105
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,490
Why did you give it life?

1106
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,910
Why did you give it an existence?

1107
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,050
Maybe to you this is somehow its own branch or path.

1108
00:46:59,430 --> 00:46:59,950
No!

1109
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:05,930
Maybe when you go talk about this with your friends you'll say, oh did you get the broom closet ending?

1110
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,850
Did you get the broom closet ending?

1111
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:08,750
Was my favorite.

1112
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,110
I hope your friends find this concerning.

1113
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,990
No, I'm admiring it.

1114
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:16,410
What's that?

1115
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,870
Stanley was fat and ugly and really really stupid.

1116
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,850
He probably only got the job because of a family connection.

1117
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:24,830
That's how stupid he is.

1118
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:25,370
I'm a nipple baby!

1119
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:26,990
That or with drug money.

1120
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,870
Also Stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers.

1121
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:30,910
Oh yeah!

1122
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,450
Stanley's living the life!

1123
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,130
Well I've come to a very definite conclusion about what's going on right now.

1124
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,650
You're dead.

1125
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:52,690
You got to this broom closet, explored it a bit, and were just about to leave because there's nothing here when a physical melody of some sort shut down your central nervous system and you collapsed on the keyboard.

1126
00:47:53,850 --> 00:48:02,930
Well in a situation like this, the responsible thing is to alert someone nearby so as to ensure that your body is taken care of before it begins to decompose.

1127
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,170
Hello anyone who happens to be nearby?

1128
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,030
The person at this computer is dead.

1129
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:09,810
I'm dead!

1130
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:14,110
Therefore pray to any number of your countless human physiological vulnerabilities.

1131
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,350
It's indicative of the long term sustainability of your species.

1132
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:38,850
Please remove their corpse from the area and instruct another human to take their place, making sure they understand basic first person video game mechanics and filling them in on the history of narrative tropes in video gaming so that the irony and insightful commentary of this game is not lost on them.

1133
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,290
Thanks narrator.

1134
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,470
When you've done that just step out into the hallway.

1135
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,430
What am I supposed to do?

1136
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,330
Um...

1137
00:48:50,330 --> 00:49:00,970
I am understanding the irony and the um... the intricate commentary of this... of this uh... situation.

1138
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,810
Loved your wrestling.

1139
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,910
You've ruined my taste buds.

1140
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:05,870
Thanks Viv!

1141
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:06,970
Thanks for a run.

1142
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,850
Glad you liked my wrestling.

1143
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,540
Ah, second play.

1144
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,420
You too?

1145
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,520
Unbelievable.

1146
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm at the mercy of an entire species of invalids.

1147
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,300
Perhaps there's a monkey nearby you can hand the controls to.

1148
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,200
A fish?

1149
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:27,220
Fungus?

1150
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,560
Have you decided to not move on to the afterlife to spend time here?

1151
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,040
Thanks Joe!

1152
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,620
I'll just be waiting for when you're ready to pick up the story again.

1153
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,620
Nah, nah.

1154
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:35,920
Yeah.

1155
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,260
I'm an invalid.

1156
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,680
I'm an invalid.

1157
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,340
I'm an invalid.

1158
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,420
Um... I don't know.

1159
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,000
It's my destiny to be in the broom closet.

1160
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,710
I think I'm pretty valid.

1161
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:54,210
I think I'm pretty valid though.

1162
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,850
Look, the light kind of just reminds me of the sun.

1163
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:08,630
Which you're not really supposed to stare at, but you know, when you just look at it it's just like, you know, maybe the sky turned uh...

1164
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:13,010
like an ashy brown and the sun is around.

1165
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,570
You can just imagine it.

1166
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,670
You can just think of yourself being outside and living a free life.

1167
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:21,970
You know?

1168
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,130
You don't have to...

1169
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,950
You don't have to stay confined to these walls.

1170
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,770
You are so valid.

1171
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,490
Thank you!

1172
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,810
Joe, look at the bamboo shoot!

1173
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,690
You can just look at the sun and you can just ponder.

1174
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:48,110
You can be like I'm just this tiny, insignificant creature in this vast, vast, endless universe.

1175
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:54,750
But in this moment I feel like I'm one with the universe.

1176
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,470
Is there anything else to do?

1177
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:57,610
Am I done?

1178
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,100
Um...

1179
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,190
What's that sound?

1180
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,590
God, I'm scared of the outside world.

1181
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:30,670
The broom closet's the best!

1182
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:34,450
Uh...

1183
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:38,550
Hmm...

1184
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:40,890
Ah!

1185
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:41,430
Ah!

1186
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:46,550
Oh...

1187
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,030
No!

1188
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:50,770
Please narrator!

1189
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,230
Please, please, please!

1190
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:52,910
I'm on my knees!

1191
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:53,770
I'm begging you, please!

1192
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,650
Let me go back to the broom closet!

1193
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,750
Please!

1194
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:01,390
No!

1195
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:07,770
No!

1196
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,990
What did he say?

1197
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:11,810
What did he tell me?

1198
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,130
Sorry, Mr. narrator.

1199
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,390
I'm not really paying attention.

1200
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:15,890
Ooh!

1201
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,770
This area's so spooky.

1202
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,670
Um...

1203
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:21,910
Upstairs!

1204
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:22,870
Oh, upstairs!

1205
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,470
Thank you.

1206
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,220
Is there actually a broom closet ending though?

1207
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,520
Or... Oh, I remember this room, kind of.

1208
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,980
It's the bathroom.

1209
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,240
...

1210
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,410
...

1211
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,680
I've got the feeling.

1212
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,520
I've got a feeling.

1213
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,200
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1214
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,060
The money is for stealing.

1215
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,100
The money is for stealing.

1216
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,040
The money is for stealing.

1217
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,680
A feeling.

1218
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,560
Woo-hoo!

1219
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,240
But not your money.

1220
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,420
Of course.

1221
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,660
Not your money.

1222
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,460
Extreme time.

1223
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,220
Extreme bathrooms.

1224
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,700
...

1225
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,740
Say, that's a lovely purse.

1226
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,340
Mr. Krabs felt that.

1227
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:20,960
...

1228
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,720
...

1229
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,840
Oh my god!

1230
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,460
The panda!

1231
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,820
...

1232
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:31,720
Business strategy.

1233
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:32,980
...

1234
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,100
Yes, my favorite strategy.

1235
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,340
Take out the competition.

1236
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,820
...

1237
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:38,980
...

1238
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,740
Which way are we going?

1239
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,600
...

1240
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,620
Oh.

1241
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,220
Stanley.

1242
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,600
Oh.

1243
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:13,480
...

1244
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,860
Stanley.

1245
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:18,800
...

1246
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,560
What did I say?

1247
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,280
...

1248
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,320
I can't hear you.

1249
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,220
Could you speak up a little louder?

1250
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:58,840
...

1251
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:06,120
How could you say your words enunciate instead of a mumbling?

1252
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,580
I don't understand what you're trying to say to me.

1253
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,340
...

1254
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:29,700
I don't know the words to the song, but I know that those words will be created in my heart for you, baby girl.

1255
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,800
...

1256
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,280
...

1257
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,180
Tra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1258
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,260
Well,

1259
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:59,470
this is the longest elevator in the world.

1260
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,710
...

1261
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:07,150
But it's not as long as my love for you.

1262
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,530
...

1263
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,340
In this world with nuestro trif... machine.

1264
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,120
...

1265
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,440
Well that's...

1266
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,150
What did he say?

1267
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:41,620
Does this actually end?

1268
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,960
I don't know.

1269
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,820
Recommendations from the overnight committee.

1270
00:56:51,600 --> 00:57:02,900
We're going again in circles around each other And our love is burning bright

1271
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:18,620
But I'm doing here without you But I know that I'll see you tonight

1272
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,020
I don't know if I should stop it or not.

1273
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,220
We're almost there?

1274
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:35,600
Okay.

1275
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,530
It's glowing slow because the weight limit is being reached.

1276
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,950
It's just you in the elevator, right?

1277
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,090
I shot them.

1278
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:14,950
I shot them with an arrow of love Just like me I'm just so smitten for you, girl

1279
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,260
Oh, come on!

1280
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,000
I am the most expensive boss.

1281
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,400
If I go down...

1282
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,800
Thanks for making the elevator go slow, Mr. Narad.

1283
00:58:48,460 --> 00:59:02,640

1285
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:16,360
Solid cupid and their 5.56 rifle of love.

1286
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,580
What a thrill Okay.

1287
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,680
Silence and darkness rule the night

1288
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:44,830
I can't remember the lyrics if I'm not singing it.

1289
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:27,910
I can't remember the lyrics if I'm not singing it.

1290
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,470
Hum...hum...hum...business...time...oh...business time.

1291
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:09,710
Our hostile takeover is the new bi-annual percentage.

1292
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,410
Two votes!

1293
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:16,850
Snake Eater Bossa Nova Elevator Remix.

1294
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:19,790
The beige pages.

1295
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,140
Switch Lilies by Claude Manille.

Corte Blanche featuring...Mont Blanc.

1297
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,300
Wow.

1299
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:48,680
No!

Secret pin number.

1301
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:52,600
Hmm.

1302
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,720
But of course, Stanley couldn't possibly have known this.

1303
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,330
Boob.

1304
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,020
Stanley just sat around twiddling his thumbs.

1305
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:21,620
Trying to input anything on the device was useless since he could never possibly know that the combination was 2845.

1306
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,040
Surely we'll find it out.

1307
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,320
Okay.

1308
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,760
There's two...kangaroos here.

1309
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,620
Two.

1310
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,820
Two, eight, four, five.

1311
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,120
Two...um...there's a cat.

1312
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,460
Two, uh...three.

1313
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:43,800
Hum...um...um...um.

1314
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,260
Oh, there's a globe!

1315
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,120
Around the world in 80 days.

1316
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:47,940
Eight.

1317
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:48,120
Oh, god.

1318
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,840
But it turns out that the panel's emergency override kicked in.

1319
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:52,440
Oh!

1320
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,820
And the door just opened all by itself.

1321
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,180
Oh!

1322
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,180
And Stanley got the hell along with the story.

1323
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,680
Well, whoop de do.

1324
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,180
Whoop-de-do.

1325
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,000
Whoop-de-do.

1326
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:02,900
Okay.

1327
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:11,390
Dang, hold on.

1328
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:13,950
There.

1329
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:27,460
I can't even... I can't even solve the rest of the puzzle because it's...

1330
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,140
It's all black.

1331
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,140
It's too dark.

1332
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:34,830
Okay, a little spooky.

1333
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,010
I don't like it.

1334
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:41,610
It's a little scary.

1335
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:43,350
I wouldn't trust it!

1336
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:44,490
Oh, God.

1337
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:46,130
Okay.

1338
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,530
Loading.

1339
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,570
Peculiar.

1340
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:07,490
No, no, no.

1341
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,030
Not go unanswered for long.

1342
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,430
Whoa!

1343
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:21,130
No, I like being a pawn and a little cog in the machine.

1344
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,010
I like not thinking.

1345
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,350
I like, you know, just...

1346
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:26,530
Oh!

1347
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,490
Mind control facility.

1348
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:32,990
Back up.

1349
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,030
Go back up?

1350
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:36,770
Oh, we can.

1351
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:37,270
You're right.

1352
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,410
I don't think so.

1353
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:42,090
I don't think I did.

1354
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,150
Never mind.

1355
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,890
Stanley actually got back into the elevator and went back up.

1356
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:48,750
Silly me.

1357
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:49,530
Yeah, silly you.

1358
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,030
Why did Stanley do that when he knew that it would just lead back to his boss's office?

1359
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:54,990
Well, that's a great question.

1360
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,930
Spank thinks we're the tickets in.

1361
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:57,770
I just can't wait to find out.

1362
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,850
The end is never the end.

1363
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,730
There's never the end.

1364
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,590
There's never the end.

1365
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:08,970
I'm excited to find out, too.

1366
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,750
Something must have changed.

1367
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:15,590
Something seemed a little... Hmm, see, these lights are brighter.

1368
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,030
Here we are, Stanley.

1369
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,470
It's your boss's office.

1370
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:18,950
Yeah!

1371
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,650
Exactly the way it was before you got onto the elevator.

1372
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:22,350
That door.

1373
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,350
It's still just exactly what it is.

1374
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:28,190
What a decision you've made to come up here and look at the office again.

1375
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:34,270
This has fleshed out the plot of the story in new and fascinating ways I could have never anticipated.

1376
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,690
It's that keen eye for storytelling that you have.

1377
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:40,730
An incisive, rapid fire of critical plot points.

1378
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,130
One after the other.

1379
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:45,670
Weaving a rich tapestry of uncompromising narrative.

1380
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:46,210
Wow.

1381
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,210
I'm bolted to the edge of my seat.

1382
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:51,010
Are you done, mister?

1383
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,330
Are you done?

1384
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,190
Are you done being a little... a little pissy baby?

1385
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:57,710
Certificate of...

1386
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:06,230
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.

1387
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,470
Jesus.

1388
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,370
What's this?

1389
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:15,730
Shanti.

1390
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,230
2003.

1391
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:19,970
Vintage.

1392
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:25,190
Lucky.

1393
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:26,930
I guess I'll go back down now.

1394
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:29,750
I guess I'll, you know...

1395
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:32,150
Okay, I'll listen to you.

1396
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,190
I'll be able to get to the stream in a minute, glad.

1397
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,590
I was able to tune into...

1398
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:38,210
On my birthday!

1399
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,190
How does he keep coming up with all this?

1400
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:40,330
Happy birthday, Mocha!

1401
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:46,610
Happy birthday to you.

1402
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:49,130
Happy birthday...

1403
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,090
Oh no, I'm yawning.

1404
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,590
To you.

1405
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:55,150
Happy birthday, dear Mocha.

1406
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:00,490
Happy birthday to you.

1407
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,320
Surely this time, Stanley will walk forward into the spooky corridor, won't he?

1408
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,400
No.

1409
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:20,260
You know, if you want me to do something, you gotta give me the option to not do anything else.

1410
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,480
Did you think we were going to go forward down the spooky corridor?

1411
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,200
Noooo.

1412
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,200
It's time once again to go back up in the elevator.

1413
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,340
How not stupid?

1414
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,620
I can't even begin to grapple with what might be up there.

1415
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,460
Is it the boss's office again?

1416
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,180
Or what if it's the boss's office this time?

1417
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,660
The suspense is killing me.

1418
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,840
The boss's office!

1419
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,460
Boss's office!

1420
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,820
Meep!

1421
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,500
Thank you!

1422
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,880
Boss's office!

1423
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,220
Boss's office!

1424
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,040
Yes!

1425
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,520
The boss's office!

1426
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,260
Oh my god.

1427
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,340
It's the boss's office.

1428
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,380
This absolutely changes everything for me.

1429
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,640
Give me a time out here for a minute while I process this.

1430
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,500
Oh!

1431
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,920
This is making me sleepy.

1432
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,220
Okay, I'm ready.

1433
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,640
I'm prepared to embrace this stunning revelation and to move forward with...

1434
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:29,900
No!

1435
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:30,920
No, wait!

1436
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:31,660
No wait?

1437
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,240
No!

1438
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,700
I need more time to process.

1439
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:35,920
Oh.

1440
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,580
Please hold, everybody.

1441
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,240
Please hold.

1442
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:38,960
Please hold.

1443
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,800
I'm gonna make this into, like, my Be Right Back screen.

1444
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:49,160
I remember wanting one of those drinking birds when I was a kid.

1445
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,720
Everybody hold on.

1446
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,280
Just pretend I'm going to the bathroom.

1447
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,820
I have fully come to terms with it.

1448
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:03,200
I have made space in my world view for this astonishing new reality.

1449
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,780
As before, I turn to your expert eye for gripping narrative, Master Stanley.

1450
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,300
Wait, but I'm the maid.

1451
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,220
You're the master.

1452
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,820
I'm just a maid.

1453
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,560
I don't have to do... I don't deserve the title of master.

1454
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,960
Master Stanley.

1455
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,920
It's got a nice ring to it, though.

1456
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,200
Of course.

1457
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,480
Going back down again a bit.

1458
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,700
Max, like, you would be cute.

1459
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,460
I mean, sure, now it's obvious.

1460
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:41,960
But you have to understand that 30 seconds ago, this kind of thing had never been attempted before.

1461
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,180
I have to be your maid.

1462
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,400
A frame of reference to even anticipate it.

1463
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:49,460
That's just how revelatory Stanley's decision making is.

1464
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:49,940
Yeah.

1465
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,640
A breath of fresh air in a landscape of storytelling that has grown stale and repetitive.

1466
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,240
Loading, loading, loading.

1467
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,220
It's not going to get me this time.

1468
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,800
It didn't even talk.

1469
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,480
I can see the mind control and...

1470
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,520
Oh, there it is.

1471
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:13,760
It's like a little...

1472
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,240
They should have done a better job at hiding it.

1473
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,280
I feel like, you know.

1474
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,740
Should we go up one more time?

1475
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:24,180
I mean...

1476
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,780
It's like right there.

1477
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,720
Stanley walks straight ahead through the large door that read Mind Control Facility.

1478
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,140
You know what?

1479
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,960
Every time he tells me what to do, I don't want to do it.

1480
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,740
Every time he's just like, Stanley does this.

1481
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,660
I'm like, no I don't.

1482
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:42,380
I have free will.

1483
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:43,680
I...

1484
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,580
I'm Stanley.

1485
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,440
You know what?

1486
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:48,900
What?

1487
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:50,320
I've just thought of something.

1488
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:50,740
Okay.

1489
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,240
Hold on, let's stop for a minute.

1490
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:52,780
Oh.

1491
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:53,380
Oh.

1492
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:53,940
Don't you realize?

1493
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,540
It's the anticipation, Stanley.

1494
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,940
Watching me while sewing up my off-cut cosplay.

1495
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,200
You and I, we have no way of knowing what will be at the top of this elevator.

1496
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:00,560
See you there.

1497
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,400
But the suspense.

1498
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,000
The suspense?

1499
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,880
The agony of waiting and anticipating.

1500
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,680
Oh my god, the thrill.

1501
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,300
And having to guess.

1502
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,680
That's the real thrill.

1503
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,500
Oh, I simply don't want to let that feeling go.

1504
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,700
It's so precious.

1505
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,040
So fleeting.

1506
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:13,760
So fleeting.

1507
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,640
Why don't we take this elevator ride nice and slow?

1508
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,880
Oh my god.

1509
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,280
There we go.

1510
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,080
Bosses.

1511
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,980
Isn't this so much more exciting?

1512
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:31,600
You know, Stanley, it seems like nowadays the only thing that audiences want is to be shocked as loudly and frequently as possible.

1513
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,060
Please don't do that.

1514
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,200
No, no, no.

1515
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,260
Please don't do that.

1516
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:34,980
No, no, no.

1517
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,000
No, no, no.

1518
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,000
Please don't do that.

1519
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:38,640
Please.

1520
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,920
But where's the tension?

1521
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,240
Where's the tension?

1522
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:45,680
Where's the trust in the audience to build a slow and nuanced appreciation for the story?

1523
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,220
You can go your own pace, Winter.

1524
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,140
Why aren't we given time to imagine the surprises?

1525
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,500
To have to think and to anticipate and then to marvel at the eventual reveal.

1526
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,520
This is storytelling, Stanley.

1527
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,840
What you and I are doing right now.

1528
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,120
This is the most exciting narrative to be developed in years.

1529
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,100
And it's really all because of you.

1530
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,060
It's innovative, I know.

1531
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,520
I know.

1532
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,140
Never.

1533
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,000
He wants to marry.

1534
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,420
I thought he was kind of scary looking.

1535
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,540
Sharp.

1536
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:41,660
You're great at the Canadian truck placement though.

1537
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,320
Thank you!

1538
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,320
Thanks, Drex!

1539
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,540
Thanks for going.

1540
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,100
I'm a role model!

1541
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,400
Okay.

1542
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,300
Oh.

1543
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,240
My mid-talk?

1544
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,540
Okay.

1545
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,620
Stan-talk?

1546
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,760
I don't know if you realize the impact you have on them.

1547
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:15,380
This is the kind of gesture that might leave a tremendous impact on them for the better.

1548
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,460
The better?

1549
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,140
Whoa!

1550
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,760
Boss's office!

1551
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:27,580
The room where we're holding the press conference should be just around the corner here somewhere.

1552
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,500
Live on stage.

1553
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,100
All eyes on Stanley.

1554
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:35,680
Stanley.

1555
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,660
World's healthiest human being.

1556
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:41,960
All tricks revealed.

1557
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,600
Doctors hate her!

1558
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,400
We did it.

1559
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,420
The pyramids.

1560
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,720
The guy who went to Mars.

1561
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:51,340
Who is that over there?

1562
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,040
Look at this though.

1563
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:53,480
Oh, here.

1564
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,060
I thought...

1565
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:00,780
I thought for a second that was Jack's films.

1566
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,060
Stanley reveals all in his new book.

1567
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,320
I'm a published author even?

1568
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,840
Okay.

1569
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:16,070
World peace baby!

1570
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:18,770
Ah, yes.

1571
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,730
Here it is.

1572
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,130
Just through this door.

1573
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:23,810
The Stanley Parable Stanley.

1574
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:24,610
Tonight.

1575
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,190
Live on stage.

1576
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,830
What was I saying over there?

1577
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:29,110
The man.

1578
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:30,050
The process.

1579
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:30,730
The myth.

1580
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,430
The legend.

1581
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,700
The world's first sentient machine.

1582
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:40,200
The world's first sentient machine.

1583
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:40,560
The world's first sentient machine.

1584
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:41,360
Wow.

1585
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,800
Have you guys heard how like...

1586
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,700
Like these...

1587
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,740
These tech places that are like...

1588
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,420
That are like having...

1589
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,220
Creating robots.

1590
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,280
First of all, I have an issue.

1591
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,100
Why do the robots they create have to look so human?

1592
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,500
Why can't they like look like cool robots?

1593
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,060
You know?

1594
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,600
Why can't they look like Drossel from Fireball?

1595
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,480
Why can't we get just hot...

1596
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,220
I mean cute...

1597
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,100
Why can't we just get robots instead of like...

1598
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,780
Uncanny Valley humans?

1599
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,720
You know what I'm saying?

1600
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:11,960
But also...

1601
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,980
Why are they all so flirty?

1602
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,600
Why is it all...

1603
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,160
The built female robots are just like...

1604
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,680
Oh, hey.

1605
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,460
You are just...

1606
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,960
It is just a wonderful time meeting you tonight.

1607
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,200
And I just...

1608
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,700
They just say some really unhinged things that make me think.

1609
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,100
Like...

1610
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,320
If they...

1611
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,040
Are they actually trying to...

1612
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:34,720
You know...

1613
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,380
Get with a human and then have human robot babies?

1614
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,380
I just don't know.

1615
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:51,050
Because we need Chobits.

1616
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:52,230
We will never have Chobits.

1617
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:52,650
You know why?

1618
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,630
Because they are not anime.

1619
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,350
But you know what I bought recently?

1620
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:57,750
Two!

1621
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:58,430
Thank you!

1622
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:00,530
Hold on.

1623
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:01,670
This sounds terrible.

1624
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:04,190
Can we go back to the hot robots bit?

1625
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,750
I don't know what you are talking about.

1626
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,090
You know what I bought recently?

1627
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:09,810
I bought...

1628
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,550
Have you guys ever heard of the gate box?

1629
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,930
It is basically like...

1630
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,610
The original is this giant like...

1631
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,920
Tubular looking thing.

1632
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,550
And it is pretty big.

1633
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:22,290
But inside is a hologram.

1634
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:23,630
Anime lady.

1635
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,110
And...

1636
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,810
I didn't buy the original one.

1637
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,910
Because they are usually...

1638
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,930
They are like really expensive.

1639
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,830
The gay box?

1640
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,750
No, the gate.

1641
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:35,150
The...

1642
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:38,430
The gate box.

1643
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,150
What is wrong with you guys?

1644
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,530
Did you buy a hot robot?

1645
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:44,310
Maybe.

1646
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:45,690
But...

1647
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,950
If you are interested in getting one.

1648
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:50,430
They actually...

1649
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,530
First of all, they have a booth.

1650
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:54,310
But second of all, they have a version of it.

1651
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:55,490
That is...

1652
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,590
It is like a little...

1653
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:59,350
It is like a figure box almost.

1654
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:01,330
And it is 6000 yen.

1655
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,370
It is basically just like...

1656
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,210
A glorified Alexa.

1657
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,530
But with an anime girl in it.

1658
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,250
And they also make one of a...

1659
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,290
Oh gosh, what is that anime?

1660
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,330
I don't have my phone in...

1661
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,090
Where did I leave my phone?

1662
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,630
Oh no, I don't know where my phone is.

1663
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,510
But...

1664
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,770
They have like one of the original girl.

1665
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:21,770
And they have one of...

1666
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,650
Of an anime character.

1667
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,610
I can't remember her name.

1668
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:27,150
But yeah, they are like affordable.

1669
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:28,630
So...

1670
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,110
And...

1671
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,130
And...

1672
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:35,070
And...

1673
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,550
With the one that I got.

1674
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:39,990
Maybe I shouldn't say this.

1675
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,830
It just arrived to my...

1676
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:45,210
Proxy like...

1677
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:45,850
The other day.

1678
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,390
So I won't have it until I get back.

1679
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,510
But I am going to experiment a little bit with it.

1680
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:52,690
I am going to experiment a little.

1681
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,450
Has an anime girl in it.

1682
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:56,510
Are you sure it isn't a gay box for you?

1683
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:57,610
It is the gay...

1684
01:17:58,510 --> 01:17:58,950
Box.

1685
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:03,310
Yeah.

1686
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,140
Something unrelated.

1687
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,360
But do you have Dave the Diver?

1688
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,200
I do not.

1689
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:13,760
I actually got the...

1690
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:14,680
The...

1691
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:15,860
The Godzilla.

1692
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,700
I got the Godzilla DLC.

1693
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:22,860
But yeah.

1694
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,360
So if you always...

1695
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,520
If you saw the gay box and always wanted one.

1696
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,800
But were just like me and being like this is way too expensive.

1697
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,800
I haven't...

1698
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,560
I haven't tried it yet.

1699
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,940
But I am sure it will be awesome.

1700
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:39,230
Anyway.

1701
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:40,570
No.

1702
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:45,910
Is that my name?

1703
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:50,370
Stanley Ryder?

1704
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:52,570
Okay.

1705
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:53,730
The heart.

1706
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,110
The heart.

1707
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:56,210
Oh.

1708
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:01,490
Go get him.

1709
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:02,830
Almonds.

1710
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,210
Chair.

1711
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,750
Gum.

1712
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:04,250
Table.

1713
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:05,870
Nut bar.

1714
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:07,510
Oh God.

1715
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:07,950
Hold on.

1716
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:10,390
The dude who came up with pizza.

1717
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:11,910
I can't compete with him.

1718
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,910
I can't do it.

1719
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:16,950
Oh God.

1720
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,390
I am just going to eat these real quick.

1721
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,490
Oh God.

1722
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:24,610
I can't do this.

1723
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:25,350
I can't do this.

1724
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,070
Is that my green room?

1725
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:28,410
427.

1726
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,050
That's me.

1727
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,630
I am amongst the greats.

1728
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,290
I can't...

1729
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:34,630
I don't deserve to be here.

1730
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:36,710
Okay.

1731
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:39,110
Okay.

1732
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:39,430
Hold on.

1733
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,530
Let's look over what I said.

1734
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,090
My notes.

1735
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:41,470
My notes.

1736
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:42,810
Stanley.

1737
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:43,190
Me.

1738
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:43,830
Dad.

1739
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,630
Age 6.

1740
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:45,270
Story.

1741
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,630
Son is...

1742
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:52,570
Son is wanting me to do a good job.

1743
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:54,810
Break a leg champ.

1744
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:55,690
Your boss.

1745
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:56,570
Thanks boss.

1746
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:58,010
Stanley.

1747
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,610
My true love for you grows every day.

1748
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,130
You make me feel alive.

1749
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:04,190
Your wife from the...

1750
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,950
Experiment depart...

1751
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:06,530
Wait.

1752
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:07,530
Oh from the...

1753
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,950
From the...

1754
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:10,810
From the...

1755
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,590
Experiment ending.

1756
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:14,250
We have a wife.

1757
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:17,910
I love the way you ride elevators.

1758
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:18,890
XX.

1759
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:20,910
We are cheating on our wife.

1760
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,090
That I just learned that we had.

1761
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,750
No one tells stories the way you do.

1762
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:26,830
Go get them tiger.

1763
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:30,230
Thanks for showing me that cool skateboard trick.

1764
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:31,050
In the parking lot.

1765
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,130
You are too cool.

1766
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:33,130
Good luck on stage.

1767
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:33,770
Rock on.

1768
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:35,410
Break a leg champ.

1769
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:35,930
Your boss.

1770
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,050
They wrote two notes.

1771
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,270
They are so kind.

1772
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:42,070
Thanks for showing me that cool skateboard trick.

1773
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:42,990
Reminds me.

1774
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,110
You know when someone tweets something.

1775
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:48,230
And then everybody replies to that.

1776
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,410
To kind of hype them up.

1777
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,950
Just like thanks for letting me borrow your Mercedes.

1778
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,750
And saving me from the...

1779
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,670
It's the same vibes I'm getting.

1780
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,130
The freedom ending.

1781
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:07,070
Adventure.

1782
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,930
I went to the mind control facility.

1783
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:12,250
And all I got was this lousy sticker.

1784
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,920
Congratulations Stanley.

1785
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:19,620
Remember where you came from.

1786
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,600
Your co-workers.

1787
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,680
We got a little golf thing.

1788
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,000
And everything.

1789
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,100
I can hear the people.

1790
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,000
They are waiting for me.

1791
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:39,660
You can do this.

1792
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,700
You can do this.

1793
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:42,640
You can do this.

1794
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,680
You can do this.

1795
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,830
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1796
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:52,910
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1797
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:54,790
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1798
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,650
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1799
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,430
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1800
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,290
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1801
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:02,010
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1802
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:02,510
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1803
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:03,990
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers.

1804
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:23,710
Oh wait, I didn't even get to the end.

1805
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:36,510
Is it WrestleTuber 2025 already?

1806
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,030
Just like a WrestleTuber.

1807
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,940
This fucked me for a long time, but...

1808
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:47,740
How were they already...

1809
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,140
Already what?

1810
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,040
Oh sorry, hold on.

1811
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,520
I couldn't see it.

1812
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,560
Already pickled when he picked them.

1813
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,420
Doesn't add up.

1814
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:55,320
So true.

1815
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,600
Was it all just a dream?

1816
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,320
Every time I...

1817
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,180
I say every time...

1818
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,600
I was gonna say every time I play this game.

1819
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,740
Which I have not...

1820
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,100
I don't wanna make it seem like I've played it a lot.

1821
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,780
But I always...

1822
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:30,660
I guess maybe every loop I expect to see a person.

1823
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:31,320
You know what I mean?

1824
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:35,970
It's new.

1825
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,570
It's new.

1826
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:48,210
Like Exit 8?

1827
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,230
Yes, yes, yes.

1828
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,620
Maybe you just haven't found the right path yet.

1829
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,200
Oh.

1830
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:01,840
New content?

1831
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,560
What does that mean?

1832
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,820
New content?

1833
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:05,600
I don't know.

1834
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,660
You tell me.

1835
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,310
Another elevator, my favorite.

1836
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,070
Oh.

1837
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:19,530
Okay.

1838
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:28,110
It's like a ride.

1839
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,330
It's like a theme park ride.

1840
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:33,550
Hello and thank you for playing the Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.

1841
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:40,110
As you may know, the Stanley Parable was a video game released in 2013 on home computers.

1842
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:53,190
After receiving critical and commercial success, it was expanded upon in 2022 with the Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, a reimagining of the game for consoles and home computers.

1843
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:53,850
Home computers.

1844
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:54,490
That's me.

1845
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:55,410
That's where I'm at.

1846
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:56,410
Well, I'm gonna make it happen.

1847
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,250
This is my home.

1848
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:02,910
The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe features exciting new content that broadens and expands the world of the Stanley Parable.

1849
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:03,230
More games.

1850
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:05,170
Delighting audiences the world over.

1851
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:05,750
Happy.

1852
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,390
Happy.

1853
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:15,250
Let's step inside and see what thrilling new adventures await in the Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.

1854
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,730
Wow.

1855
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,570
This sounds delightful.

1856
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:21,830
I'm very excited to see the thrilling new Ultra Deluxe content.

1857
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:22,670
Me too.

1858
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,910
Though I'm pretty sure I did this before.

1859
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:28,950
But that's okay.

1860
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:30,450
I don't remember.

1861
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,510
I really don't remember you so bad.

1862
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:34,270
I'm sure it's just the beginning of a mesmerizing adventure.

1863
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:35,310
Cat potato.

1864
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,210
Welcome to the membership.

1865
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:36,790
Thank you.

1866
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:37,990
Uh.

1867
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,390
Is it broken?

1868
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:42,990
What's going on here?

1869
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,150
Should we...

1870
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:46,850
Should we be moving somewhere or...

1871
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,090
Oh.

1872
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:47,470
Oh.

1873
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:47,630
Oh.

1874
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,050
There we go.

1875
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:48,590
There we go.

1876
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:48,990
All right.

1877
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:49,030
Finally.

1878
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:50,090
At long last.

1879
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,670
It's on to the new content.

1880
01:25:51,810 --> 01:25:53,790
I've never been more ready.

1881
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,570
Let's do it.

1882
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,230
Yeah.

1883
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:56,690
Oh my gosh.

1884
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:57,490
I'm so excited.

1885
01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:00,790
Because there's so much content.

1886
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:01,570
It's true.

1887
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:02,650
This game is really crazy.

1888
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:07,530
I have to say, initial impressions of Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, mostly tedious.

1889
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:09,070
It's as if the...

1890
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,290
Hmm.

1891
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:09,370
Hmm.

1892
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:10,310
Oh, okay.

1893
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:11,770
Let's see the content.

1894
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,250
Give me the content, Stanley.

1895
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:14,010
Oh my gosh.

1896
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:14,790
I'm a content creator.

1897
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,970
I can give that to you.

1898
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:18,330
Now thinking about it.

1899
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,090
Thinking about like some of the endings that I remember.

1900
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:27,490
There's one in particular that I remember that was like...

1901
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:29,250
Oh.

1902
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:34,350
You like sit in a room and like thousands of years go by and stuff like that.

1903
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:35,370
That's the only one I remember.

1904
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:37,530
Wait.

1905
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:38,130
Is this the room?

1906
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:38,890
Uh-oh.

1907
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:39,370
Oh.

1908
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:39,930
Wait.

1909
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:42,070
Uh.

1910
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,010
No.

1911
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:44,190
All right.

1912
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:45,530
All right.

1913
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,010
Let's see.

1914
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,090
It's the jump circle.

1915
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:51,150
Oh my gosh.

1916
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:01,230
Wait.

1917
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:01,770
No.

1918
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,450
I think I jumped enough.

1919
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:05,610
Is that it?

1920
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:06,390
No.

1921
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,410
Surely that's not all the new content.

1922
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:10,350
There has to be something else, right?

1923
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,030
Oh, there's all...

1924
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,250
Okay.

1925
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:11,550
Hold on.

1926
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:12,310
I'm going to finish it.

1927
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:12,950
I'm going to finish it.

1928
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:15,210
Jumping.

1929
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:16,150
Jumping.

1930
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:16,590
Jumping.

1931
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:27,050
Save the jumps?

1932
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,690
Oh.

1933
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:30,650
Okay.

1934
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,500
Another elevator.

1935
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:46,340
Stanley, I have to say, initial impressions of this game are not...

1936
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,320
My stream is so wasteful.

1937
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,240
It's just elevators and jumping.

1938
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,240
Is this what passes for exciting new content?

1939
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:52,720
I know.

1940
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:58,100
I know that you guys are excited but also try not to like backseat too much.

1941
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:58,520
I do.

1942
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,900
I do want to experience things on my own as well.

1943
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:03,100
So...

1944
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,440
If I screw up, that's up to me.

1945
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,060
You know what I mean?

1946
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,160
Okay.

1947
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:14,540
I knew there had to be something else.

1948
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,500
Let's see it.

1949
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,460
I'm ready for whatever it is.

1950
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:17,700
Oh.

1951
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:18,280
The abyss.

1952
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,280
The abyss office.

1953
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,600
Thank you for enjoying the new content.

1954
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,680
That's it?

1955
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:27,900
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

1956
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,540
You see, Stanley?

1957
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:39,380
This is what happens when greedy video game developers with no respect for their fan base rush a cheap expansion to market for no reason other than to make an easy dollar.

1958
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,280
Classic abyss room.

1959
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:40,760
Classic.

1960
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,740
And don't get misguided on the level of craftsmanship that's gone into it.

1961
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:43,860
My office had three.

1962
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:49,660
In fact, I'm looking right now at the game's achievements and it's hard to believe one of them actually says, test achievement, please ignore.

1963
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,020
What quality assurance department signed off on this?

1964
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:53,380
Can I get that one?

1965
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,660
I haven't gotten a single achievement, actually.

1966
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:59,340
I'm infuriated and I'm offended and I intend to find these people on Twitter and hold them personally accountable.

1967
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,140
Formally, Twitter.

1968
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,020
It's my fault, Stanley.

1969
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,680
I built up too much anticipation around the new content, I'm afraid.

1970
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,200
It could never have lived up to such expectations.

1971
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:09,020
Speak the truth.

1972
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:15,980
If you're still with me, why don't we just reset the game and we'll try to get back to what the Stanley Parable is really about.

1973
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,600
No frills.

1974
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,860
No gimmicks.

1975
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,500
No gimmicks.

1976
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,620
Just you and me having a great time together, like always.

1977
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,820
What do you say, friend?

1978
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,300
Oh.

1979
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:27,940
Oh.

1980
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:28,140
Oh.

1981
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:34,180
It's a little different.

1982
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,640
That's my office.

1983
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,220
That's where I'm supposed to be in this very moment.

1984
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:43,160
Okay.

1985
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:45,000
Fascinating.

1986
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:45,800
Psst.

1987
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,000
Stanley, come over here.

1988
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,520
In the vent.

1989
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,580
I want to show you something.

1990
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,420
Ew.

1991
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,220
Ew.

1992
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,040
Ew.

1993
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:56,680
Ew.

1994
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,040
Ew.

1995
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:57,360
Ew.

1996
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:57,560
Ew.

1997
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,140
Ew.

1998
01:29:59,280 --> 01:29:59,640
Ew.

1999
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,120
Ew.

2000
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:00,560
Ew.

2001
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:00,720
Ew.

2002
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,080
It's like...

2003
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:01,740
It's like it.

2004
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,440
It's so sus.

2005
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,260
What if I don't listen to him?

2006
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:10,800
Let's see.

2007
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:11,340
Let's try this.

2008
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:11,620
Oh.

2009
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,760
You don't want to see the cool surprise I made for you?

2010
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:14,980
Well, fine.

2011
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:15,580
Oh, surprise?

2012
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:17,580
You're a dork anyway, so who cares?

2013
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:19,840
Excuse...

2014
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:19,960
Oh.

2015
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:20,420
Oh, what?

2016
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,860
Are you saying that I'm not, like, cool enough to go through?

2017
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:23,180
Oh.

2018
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:23,580
Never mind.

2019
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:24,860
You're not a dork.

2020
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:36,040
I think I heard something.

2021
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:36,580
I think I have to go.

2022
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:45,600
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.

2023
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,180
This was not the correct way to the meeting room.

2024
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:51,260
I'm not listening to you at all.

2025
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:52,300
And Stanley knew it perfectly well.

2026
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,600
I'm not listening to you to do anything.

2027
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,660
Perhaps he wanted to stop by the employee lounge first.

2028
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:56,140
At all.

2029
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,280
Just to admire it.

2030
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:57,760
No.

2031
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:58,800
Wow.

2032
01:30:58,860 --> 01:30:59,860
I'm just going to keep going.

2033
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:00,580
Yes.

2034
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:00,960
This room.

2035
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,440
Screw you.

2036
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,380
Call me.

2037
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:02,680
Yep.

2038
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,980
Stanley took the first open door on his left.

2039
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:06,380
La, la, la, la.

2040
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:07,920
I'm not done.

2041
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,180
I'm not done.

2042
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,300
I'm not listening to anything you say any longer.

2043
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,560
Stanley was so bad at following directions, it's incredible he wasn't fired years ago.

2044
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,300
Do not lie.

2045
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:17,560
If you are lying right now, stop.

2046
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:18,820
Okay.

2047
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,540
What if I told you my real name wasn't really Mint Phantom?

2048
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:35,440
What if I told you that I named myself that when I came back from consciousness after dying because I had a spearmint in my tummy?

2049
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,160
Do not jump from cargo, Liz.

2050
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,940
Cargo lift while it is in motion will cause death.

2051
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,360
Penalty for misuse of cargo lift 1000.

2052
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,720
Penalty for jumping off the cargo lift 5000.

2053
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,700
Look, Stanley.

2054
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,460
I think perhaps we've gotten off on the wrong foot here.

2055
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,980
I'm not your enemy.

2056
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:51,880
Really, I'm not.

2057
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,060
There's the exit.

2058
01:31:53,340 --> 01:32:01,240
I realize investing your trust in someone else can be difficult, but the fact is that the story has been about nothing but you all this time.

2059
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:04,200
There's someone you've been neglecting, Stanley.

2060
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,320
Someone you've forgotten about.

2061
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:07,360
Really?

2062
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,160
I'm sorry.

2063
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,320
I was in the middle of something.

2064
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,660
Do you have zero consideration for others?

2065
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,180
Are you that convinced that I want something bad to happen to you?

2066
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,360
Why, I don't know how to convince you of this, but I really do want to help you.

2067
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,000
To show you something beautiful.

2068
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,840
Look, let me prove it.

2069
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:26,180
Let me prove that I'm on your side.

2070
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,620
Give me a chance.

2071
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:28,700
I'm no dork.

2072
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,500
Give me a chance.

2073
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,900
What are we, in a relationship?

2074
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:35,160
Now, right?

2075
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:35,760
Or...

2076
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,140
Ghosts don't know.

2077
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:38,640
No followers.

2078
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:39,520
Yeah.

2079
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,820
No buckets past this point.

2080
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:45,520
Now listen carefully.

2081
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,300
This is important.

2082
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:49,080
Stanley walked through the red door.

2083
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:57,970
This one has a swipe... a key card.

2084
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:05,020
Hmm.

2085
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:07,960
Um.

2086
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:19,060
Aha.

2087
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,400
Perhaps you misunderstood.

2088
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,640
Stanley walked through the red door.

2089
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:25,660
I'm sorry.

2090
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,280
He just picked me up like I was a goddamn sim.

2091
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:30,860
I'm colorblind.

2092
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,560
I'm colorblind!

2093
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,120
Oh!

2094
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,020
I still don't think we're communicating properly.

2095
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,540
Stanley walked through the red door.

2096
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,120
Red door.

2097
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:42,340
Door, door, door, door, door, door, door.

2098
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,880
Door, door, door, door, door, door, door, door.

2099
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,100
All right.

2100
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:44,380
Fine.

2101
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,380
Go ahead, Stanley.

2102
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,960
You want to know so badly what's out there?

2103
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,480
You want to find out what lies at the end of this road?

2104
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,220
You've chosen...

2105
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:51,640
Yeah!

2106
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,180
Don't let me stop you.

2107
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:53,860
Oh, I do.

2108
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,280
Oh.

2109
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:55,420
Wait.

2110
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:55,660
Is...

2111
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,960
Is this the place that I got spoiled before?

2112
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:59,000
You see?

2113
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,380
There's nothing here.

2114
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:00,640
Oh.

2115
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:03,160
I haven't even finished building this section of the map.

2116
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:03,640
Oh.

2117
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,680
Because you were never supposed to be here in the first place.

2118
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,000
Oh.

2119
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:06,800
Broken rooms.

2120
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,480
Exposed developer textures.

2121
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,040
Oh, that's true.

2122
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:09,940
Is this what you had wanted?

2123
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:14,820
Was it worth ruining the entire story I had written out specifically for you?

2124
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,420
Do you not think I put a lot of time into that?

2125
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,280
Because I did.

2126
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:20,260
And in the end, it was all for nothing.

2127
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:20,980
When do we get to the baby?

2128
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,420
Because this is what you wanted to see.

2129
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,080
Baby.

2130
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:23,900
Help me here, Stanley.

2131
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,440
Help elucidate these strange and unknowable desires of yours.

2132
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,460
What would have made this game better?

2133
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:29,960
A baby.

2134
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,180
What did you want to see?

2135
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:31,880
Anime.

2136
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:32,520
Vehicles?

2137
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,280
Skill tree?

2138
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:33,940
Skill tree.

2139
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:34,520
Work with me.

2140
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,840
You give me absolutely nothing so far.

2141
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:36,480
Give me Minecraft.

2142
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,360
Tell you what.

2143
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:41,980
Let me take a stab in the dark at a new design and you can give me some feedback.

2144
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:43,740
There we go.

2145
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:44,980
A third option.

2146
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:48,360
This already feels leaps ahead of where we were before.

2147
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,740
Go ahead, Stanley.

2148
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:50,740
Take it for a spin.

2149
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,020
Okay.

2150
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:53,720
Oh.

2151
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,260
Oh.

2152
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,100
I'm going to stop you there.

2153
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,420
Now, tell me about your experience with this new version.

2154
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:05,340
Would you say that the game benefited from allowing you more choices?

2155
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,180
Feel free to be honest.

2156
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,960
I'm looking for some real critical feedback here.

2157
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,680
Five is the best or one is the best?

2158
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,060
You gotta tell me which is the best.

2159
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:17,160
Five or one?

2160
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,060
Disagree?

2161
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,180
Highly disagree?

2162
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,020
Highly agree?

2163
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:23,800
Hmm.

2164
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:26,340
A one?

2165
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,100
I mean, I can understand if you had reservations.

2166
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:34,440
You saw ways the game could be improved to more fully express itself mechanically and artistically.

2167
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,260
But a one?

2168
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:35,960
A one?

2169
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:36,740
That's not even helpful.

2170
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,520
What am I supposed to do with that?

2171
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:39,560
Hmm.

2172
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:41,680
But I guess it isn't my place to judge.

2173
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,420
Here, based on the data from your previous play through, I've compiled a new version.

2174
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:48,060
Okay.

2175
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,780
And if you're perfectly candid, I think I've knocked it out of the park with this one.

2176
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:52,860
Let's take a look.

2177
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:53,780
Okay.

2178
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:54,480
Oh.

2179
01:35:55,180 --> 01:36:01,440
Now, would you say that competitive leaderboard helped you feel motivated to keep walking through doors?

2180
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,700
Again, honest answers, please.

2181
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,200
Wait.

2182
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,020
Are these real people?

2183
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:09,280
No.

2184
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,240
Oh, no.

2185
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:10,640
Okay.

2186
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,420
21.3% of players skipped the intro sequence.

2187
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,820
That's a dead rat!

2188
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,620
Oh,

2189
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,020
a dead rat!

2190
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,140
How long does it take you to get to the correct place?

2191
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:35,530
Wow,

2192
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:45,450
I don't have any progress.

2193
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,450
The time comes.

2194
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:47,930
Yeah.

2195
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:53,610
One on one.

2196
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:58,270
I open the door and go out all of a sudden and come out.

2197
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:58,350
Apparently everyone is hit.

2198
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,490
Uh-oh.

2199
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:08,390
Happy Memorial Day, Mint.

2200
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:09,270
Eat anything.

2201
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:11,150
Eat anything.

2202
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,510
What what?

2203
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:13,430
Go today at Barbecue Roops for dinner.

2204
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:13,790
Yummy!

2205
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,330
I bugged the game.

2206
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,040
You can't jump.

2207
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:26,580
No, seriously.

2208
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:27,340
We disabled it.

2209
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,280
Get your first achievement.

2210
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,500
I didn't try jumping!

2211
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,680
I tried moving!

2212
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:35,760
Uh-oh.

2213
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,240
Uh, I think I have to restart.

2214
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:44,940
I think I have to restart.

2215
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,920
Oh, no!

2216
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,520
I actually broke the game!

2217
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:01,720
Okay, a dead rat wouldn't have gotten stuck.

2218
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,460
That's why he's 9,327.

2219
01:38:05,620 --> 01:38:06,560
I'm a dead rat.

2220
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,580
Oh, she's a dead rat.

2221
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,280
I would never softlock their game.

2222
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:10,620
No!

2223
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,300
Rip Bozo.

2224
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:15,840
Congrats, you got the closet.

2225
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,120
Oh, here we go.

2226
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:25,830
We could go through here if we wanted.

2227
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:26,790
Psst!

2228
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,970
Stanley, come over here.

2229
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:31,490
In the vent.

2230
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:33,530
I want to show you something.

2231
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:35,510
What should we do, guys?

2232
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:36,850
Should we go through the vent or should we...

2233
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:38,290
Are you still a dork?

2234
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,830
No.

2235
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,810
No.

2236
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:43,710
I don't think so.

2237
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,700
The narrator's a dork, obviously.

2238
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:54,980
Coffee nut!

2239
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:56,860
Wow.

2240
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,500
This is pretty cinematic.

2241
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,120
Here I go.

2242
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,700
Okay, nice.

2243
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:13,340
Okay, you remember how cheap and unsatisfying the new Ultra Deluxe content turned out to be.

2244
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,100
Well, it got me thinking about the past.

2245
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:18,100
And how much better the Stanley Parable used to be.

2246
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:23,860
So I made something special and tucked it away here where the game's developers won't find it.

2247
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:24,500
Elden Ring!

2248
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:26,060
Just our little secret.

2249
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:27,420
Elden Ring!

2250
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,640
Just kidding.

2251
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:36,540
I call it the Memory Zone.

2252
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,180
Wow.

2253
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,220
It's where I've been storing all my favorite memories.

2254
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:40,920
Oh my god.

2255
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:44,920
Where I can relive the peak experiences of my life whenever I want.

2256
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,640
Guy lives in the past.

2257
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:49,020
Experiences like the launch of the Stanley Parable on PC.

2258
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,440
Wow.

2259
01:39:53,660 --> 01:40:01,220
You see, Stanley, doesn't the Memory Zone remind you of how wonderful Stanley Parable was before it was sullied with a cheap re-release?

2260
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:01,680
Oh, audiences.

2261
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,480
Cheap, cheap.

2262
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:05,900
Remember back in October of 2013 when the game originally launched?

2263
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,520
The British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

2264
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,560
Back then, video games had integrity.

2265
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,440
Back then, it all meant something.

2266
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,060
Oh, the waste.

2267
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:15,660
Memory, sweet memory.

2268
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,380
Oh my god, Steam Page!

2269
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,080
That's so funny.

2270
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,280
Ah, 2013, when the Stanley Parable was released.

2271
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,160
Life was so much more simple back in 2013.

2272
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:34,000
Especially because the Stanley Parable was just released.

2273
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,540
Oh, I was gonna say this is the actual time, but it is not.

2274
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:40,260
Our first kiss.

2275
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,600
My first car.

2276
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:44,580
The release of the Stanley Parable in 2013.

2277
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,420
Scripts.

2278
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,460
Stanley Parable on Steam.

2279
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,940
Oh no, just kidding.

2280
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,140
The website.

2281
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,060
The original remake.

2282
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,720
Good times.

2283
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,700
Oh, I've seen...

2284
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,900
Oh, the mind control facility.

2285
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,100
Oh, the two doors.

2286
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,860
Oh my gosh, this has been so long.

2287
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,960
Why is this roped off?

2288
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,040
Am I in a bad spot?

2289
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,920
Smile because it happened.

2290
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,340
Their first dollar!

2291
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,200
Or just a dollar, who knows.

2292
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,060
The demo, wow.

2293
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:39,800
2013.

2294
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,880
That means they announced Half Life 3.

2295
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,560
No, they didn't.

2296
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,200
Go outside?

2297
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,660
Don't play for five years?

2298
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,160
Stanley Parable Alpha Test.

2299
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,640
More British stuff.

2300
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:08,980
British.

2301
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,160
British.

2302
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,720
I'm glad they've been nominated a lot.

2303
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,380
Stanley Parable deals, tough choices.

2304
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:19,000
Oh, he's dead!

2305
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,620
Wait, there's another person.

2306
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:21,440
Is that her wife?

2307
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,760
The flowers are so hard.

2308
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:33,160
The flowers are so hard.

2309
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,340
The flowers are so hard.

2310
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,540
The flowers are so hard.

2311
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,140
The flowers are so hard.

2312
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:44,060
Little Stanley?

2313
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,300
Ah, little Stanley.

2314
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,400
Oh!

2315
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:53,760
It's Adele.

2316
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:02,540
Never mind, I'll find someone like you.

2317
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:08,560
And over here is where I keep reviews of the Stanley Parable.

2318
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:14,860
Wow!

2319
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:19,340
Yeah, with the full middle name.

2320
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,400
Every game!

2321
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:43,640
Persona 3!

2322
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,920
That's so relevant now!

2323
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,880
That's so relevant now!

2324
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,040
A husk.

2325
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,020
A shell of itself.

2326
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,780
So sad.

2327
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:06,800
Wow.

2328
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:08,140
What's going on?

2329
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,860
Maintenance.

2330
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:11,800
Can't go in there.

2331
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:14,820
Knowing your city.

2332
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,880
Old pictures and stuff.

2333
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:24,580
The original remake.

2334
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:26,320
Person of the year?

2335
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:26,760
That's me!

2336
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,800
Is that my wife?

2337
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,800
Who is that?

2338
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:36,140
Petscop.

2339
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,960
Collector's edition.

2340
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:46,820
Isn't that a tie?

2341
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:47,460
It's so cute.

2342
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:52,750
The greatest wealth is memory.

2343
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:59,450
The red and the blue door!

2344
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:01,630
We just saw the happy button.

2345
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:02,950
I don't think we've heard that yet.

2346
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,130
Here's another moving passage.

2347
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:07,550
This time from GameSpot.com.

2348
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:08,570
GameSpot.

2349
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:20,790
The Stanley Parable is both a richly stimulating commentary on the nature of choice in games, and one that offers some of the most enjoyable, surprising, and rewarding choices I've ever been confronted with in a game.

2350
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:21,970
Nine out of ten.

2351
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,070
Don't you get it, Stanley?

2352
01:45:23,370 --> 01:45:24,790
The game was perfect.

2353
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:26,690
I didn't need anything else.

2354
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:28,710
It didn't need new content.

2355
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:31,350
It just needed to be left alone.

2356
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:37,830
To spend the rest of time collecting dust in the hallowed hall of beloved video game memories.

2357
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:38,950
Aww.

2358
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:41,790
Yeah, it didn't need anything else.

2359
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:42,730
Oh my gosh.

2360
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:58,870
The Himmel the Hero joke made me think, like literally, I think it was like yesterday, I was thinking, I was like, man, I guess, you know, eventually Himmel the Hero jokes will like get old, but then we can just make the new joke, Himmel the Hero, loved Himmel the Hero jokes.

2361
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:01,690
So it will never get old.

2362
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:03,290
What's this?

2363
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:04,830
Oh, is this the collector?

2364
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:06,890
Oh no, this is the carpet textures.

2365
01:46:07,690 --> 01:46:09,690
Ready for your game project.

2366
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:11,010
Wow.

2367
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,780
The serious room.

2368
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:25,060
What is the...

2369
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:27,040
What is Kiara's room called again?

2370
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,160
What is that one called again?

2371
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:31,500
The...

2372
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:32,820
The...

2373
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,320
The usual room?

2374
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,100
The usual room?

2375
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:36,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2376
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:40,800
It's the usual room.

2377
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:41,880
Can I go through here?

2378
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,420
Where am I supposed to go?

2379
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,420
I went through here, didn't I?

2380
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,120
These were simpler times, Stanley.

2381
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:53,000
Oh, down here.

2382
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,700
But I wouldn't give to go back to have it all over again.

2383
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:57,440
I know.

2384
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:57,760
Wait.

2385
01:46:58,060 --> 01:46:58,760
Hang on.

2386
01:46:58,940 --> 01:46:59,280
Yeah?

2387
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,880
I don't recall this part of the memory zone before.

2388
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:03,260
What's this?

2389
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:03,960
What's down here?

2390
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,760
Oh.

2391
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:05,660
Oh.

2392
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:06,820
Whoa.

2393
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:07,600
Oh, no.

2394
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,760
God, no.

2395
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,640
Stanley, it's a collection of reviews from Steam.

2396
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,000
The online video game distributor.

2397
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,780
I haven't looked at these in years.

2398
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,120
I think I vaguely remember this part.

2399
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,020
I can't even imagine what's being collected down here.

2400
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:19,620
Oh, God.

2401
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,040
Surely these reviews were glaring as well, weren't they?

2402
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:22,400
Oh, yeah.

2403
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:24,400
Oh, yeah, baby.

2404
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,600
Steam reviews are my...

2405
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:25,940
Oh, boy.

2406
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:31,380
Honestly, I could not be bothered to play this game to full completion.

2407
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:31,860
Oh, no.

2408
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,280
The narrator is obnoxious and unfunny.

2409
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,240
Unfunny.

2410
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:39,000
With his humor and dialogue proving to be more irritating than entertaining.

2411
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:41,020
Unfunny.

2412
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,760
I'm not trying to be funny.

2413
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,920
I'm trying to make a serious work of art.

2414
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:56,900
I suppose I could write up a handful of gags to insert into the Stanley parable, but the game is already such a densely-layered web of profound philosophical insights that I can't even imagine where I'd have the room to stick them in.

2415
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,180
This one's a positive one.

2416
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,980
Don't let one bad review get you down.

2417
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:04,840
Don't worry about it.

2418
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,120
You know, it's so funny.

2419
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,720
This comment didn't inspire me to play this today.

2420
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:12,740
But I saw it coming.

2421
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:18,600
I saw a comment earlier that someone left for me that was just like, Quit your job?

2422
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:21,220
You quit your job for this?

2423
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,560
Go back to being an OL.

2424
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,480
I was like, you know what?

2425
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:27,980
I was already going to play the Stanley parable.

2426
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,660
So, it's also perfect.

2427
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:36,920
They were like, YouTube isn't forever.

2428
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,780
Go back to your old job.

2429
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,300
You'll have no life skills.

2430
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,400
I think he was on to something.

2431
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,120
I think so, too.

2432
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,160
Oh, it's getting really rainy.

2433
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:53,220
Ew, dead bodies are in here for sure.

2434
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,080
Oh, this is...

2435
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:55,400
Oh.

2436
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,180
Okay, let's see what this one says.

2437
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,260
You're reading all the bad ones.

2438
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,040
All the good ones are in here, too.

2439
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:05,320
For someone who prefers non-linear games, this preachiness gets annoying fast.

2440
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,080
Preachy?

2441
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:06,920
Stanley?

2442
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,500
I'm not preachy, am I?

2443
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:09,280
Just a little.

2444
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,820
You can tell me if I'm preachy.

2445
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:11,520
Honestly, you can.

2446
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,100
I'm telling you.

2447
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:14,720
This is actually quite shocking for me.

2448
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,080
I always will.

2449
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:17,180
To be honest, I had always...

2450
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,240
There's good ones right here.

2451
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,100
Oh, there's not that many.

2452
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,060
It's been rather terse to begin with.

2453
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:26,020
You can't know how much fluff I cut from the game to get it to feel as light and airy as it...

2454
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,740
Well, I always thought it did.

2455
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,400
But maybe it wasn't.

2456
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,340
Maybe it wasn't.

2457
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,800
What an awful memory to have to hold on to.

2458
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:37,920
These black marks are my otherwise unimpeachable track record.

2459
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,420
I mean...

2460
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:41,120
I feel like a failure.

2461
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:41,720
No!

2462
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:43,080
Like I let these people down.

2463
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,640
There's good reviews right there!

2464
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:48,200
Perhaps the Stanley Parable isn't quite as sterling as I always remembered.

2465
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,060
Uh-oh.

2466
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:56,950
I mean, there's no such thing as a perfect game except Metal Gear Solid.

2467
01:49:57,710 --> 01:49:59,570
So, you know, you can't help it.

2468
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:01,830
You know, you'll never be Metal Gear.

2469
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:03,030
You know?

2470
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:04,670
What's this one got to say?

2471
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,390
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

2472
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:09,750
You constantly have to stop doing anything so the narrator can hear you.

2473
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:13,270
You can catch up with his long-winded explanations of what's happening.

2474
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:15,390
I wish there was a skip button.

2475
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,270
A skip button.

2476
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:19,990
Well, yes.

2477
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:21,910
Yes, I think we can do that.

2478
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:27,590
If I'm truly too preachy, then maybe letting you skip ahead for just a moment, surely it couldn't hurt.

2479
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:28,510
Surely.

2480
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:31,930
Not if it means we can strike these negative reviews from the record.

2481
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:34,830
Only positive reviews of the Stanley Parable.

2482
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:37,930
That's my motto today and it's always been my motto.

2483
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:39,730
I'd do anything for the company.

2484
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:40,990
Wow.

2485
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:42,970
The customer is always right.

2486
01:50:44,610 --> 01:50:45,990
A skip button.

2487
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:46,410
Oh!

2488
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:49,410
I think this is that ending.

2489
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:53,370
Because we keep pressing the skip button, right?

2490
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:57,210
And then we skip to the end of the life, end of the world?

2491
01:50:57,770 --> 01:50:59,030
And here it is.

2492
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:00,530
Go ahead and give it a shot.

2493
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:08,930
I'll pop you forward in time so that the second my incessant droning starts to bore you, with just the push of a button, you'll have zipped right past it.

2494
01:51:09,050 --> 01:51:09,510
Spoilers.

2495
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:09,710
Spoilers.

2496
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:13,090
I'm back!

2497
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:15,110
Oh, you're back, you see?

2498
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:15,330
Yeah!

2499
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:27,770
You were only frozen in time for a few minutes, but it was plenty of time for me to deliver a long rambling monologue full of unnecessary verbal flourishes and lengthy ruminations for the nature of choice in video games.

2500
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:28,250
One o'clock.

2501
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:33,010
Of course, I happen to believe it was perhaps one of my more profound such ruminations.

2502
01:51:33,190 --> 01:51:34,490
Not that of course you need it.

2503
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:37,670
Well there, sport.

2504
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:38,450
I'm back!

2505
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:40,390
You did catch me rambling on a bit, didn't you?

2506
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:40,710
I did.

2507
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:42,290
But that's the power of the button.

2508
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:48,470
The minute I start to go off on a thoughtless display of self-absorption, it's right at your fingertips to go poof!

2509
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:49,270
And it's all over!

2510
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:50,130
It's all over!

2511
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:52,570
Oh, I can't wait to see what Cookie9 will say about this.

2512
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:53,250
Oh, he's probably, like, static.

2513
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:57,630
And whether they'll edit the rating of their Steam review, or at least change some of the wording, perhaps.

2514
01:51:57,910 --> 01:52:01,810
To be honest, I don't even know if one can change their review in the first place.

2515
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:02,350
Can you?

2516
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,290
Actually, I don't know either.

2517
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:04,550
I never leave reviews.

2518
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:06,390
I guess I should become better educated on exactly how Steam works.

2519
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:08,430
Perhaps that would have been the right thing to do.

2520
01:52:12,370 --> 01:52:14,210
This one's for you, Cookie9!

2521
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:17,770
Oh, you can.

2522
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:23,170
Now, I should say that the amount of time the button has been skipping through is becoming longer and longer.

2523
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:27,890
That last one was, well, I want to say maybe 30, 45 minutes?

2524
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:28,190
Oh!

2525
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:34,150
It's not unendurable by any means, but it's, well, there's really only so much I can ramble on to myself about.

2526
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:35,430
I know, it's shocking, isn't it?

2527
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:38,430
But at any rate, I do suggest that we not pause the video.

2528
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:39,130
I'm not going to press the button again.

2529
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:40,550
Have you seen the Helldiver 2 reviews?

2530
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:41,310
I have not.

2531
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:45,390
I think the skip button has been aptly demonstrated, and we can say goodbye to it and just... wait.

2532
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:46,910
How do we get out of here?

2533
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:47,590
Yeah, there's a...

2534
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:47,830
Oh!

2535
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:48,490
Where did the door go?

2536
01:52:48,790 --> 01:52:49,190
Oh!

2537
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:50,890
Wasn't there a door that led into this room?

2538
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:51,310
There was!

2539
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:52,970
I don't feel quite certain.

2540
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:54,530
Now, Ryder, now, Ryder, what do we do?

2541
01:52:54,870 --> 01:52:57,630
How else would we have gotten into the room in the first place?

2542
01:52:57,730 --> 01:53:02,530
I don't think one can enter a room without a door of some sort or a window or something like that.

2543
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:03,110
We can go through the ceiling.

2544
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:03,870
Do you see a window anywhere?

2545
01:53:04,090 --> 01:53:04,970
A porthole?

2546
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,790
No.

2547
01:53:05,790 --> 01:53:07,670
A sufficiently large crack in the wall?

2548
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:08,090
No.

2549
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:08,850
I'll take any of these.

2550
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:10,470
All I want is for us to move on.

2551
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:11,030
Let's just move on.

2552
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:11,250
Yeah.

2553
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:12,570
Let's just...

2554
01:53:12,570 --> 01:53:12,930
Stanley!

2555
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:13,750
Stanley!

2556
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:14,290
Yeah?

2557
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:16,610
Stanley, please don't push the button again!

2558
01:53:16,710 --> 01:53:18,050
It's been 12 hours!

2559
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,030
12 hours?

2560
01:53:19,210 --> 01:53:20,530
You've just been frozen there.

2561
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:26,810
I don't know why the skips are getting longer, but they're really, truly getting longer, and my God, there's no way out of the room.

2562
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:27,130
Uh-oh.

2563
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:28,850
Stanley, the door is gone.

2564
01:53:28,930 --> 01:53:29,310
It's completely gone.

2565
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:30,510
I have skipping Genshin impact cutscenes.

2566
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:32,350
I've looked at it from every angle.

2567
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:33,790
I've checked every one of those walls a thousand times.

2568
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:35,730
I've only played Genshin, like, once, so...

2569
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:37,570
And there's no door standing.

2570
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:37,990
Hi.

2571
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,710
I don't quite know.

2572
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:38,970
There's no door.

2573
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:43,750
There's just you and the button, and if you keep pressing it, I have no idea...

2574
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:44,130
Okay.

2575
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:45,630
Oh, Stanley.

2576
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:46,870
You're back.

2577
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:48,050
You're back.

2578
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:48,890
I'm back.

2579
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:49,110
Oh, my goodness.

2580
01:53:49,390 --> 01:53:51,230
I have someone to talk to again.

2581
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:52,510
Stanley, I...

2582
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:54,010
I think it's been a week.

2583
01:53:54,010 --> 01:53:54,550
A week?

2584
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:55,570
For two weeks.

2585
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:58,170
I've been sitting here all that time.

2586
01:53:58,270 --> 01:53:59,370
Just sitting here.

2587
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:01,450
Not a single person to speak with.

2588
01:54:01,690 --> 01:54:03,550
And you'd think that that's just how it's always been, right?

2589
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,430
I'm looking for my stool.

2590
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:05,350
Oh, there it is.

2591
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:07,970
Me talking, and you saying...

2592
01:54:07,990 --> 01:54:08,330
I'm saying nothing.

2593
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:12,150
Would you think that it's exactly the same as always?

2594
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:15,530
Doesn't that feel like what we've already been doing?

2595
01:54:15,670 --> 01:54:16,970
Me just talking?

2596
01:54:17,150 --> 01:54:18,290
But it isn't, Stanley.

2597
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:19,830
It isn't the same at all.

2598
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:21,090
It isn't even close.

2599
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:24,890
Because I know you can't hear me once you push that button.

2600
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:25,150
No.

2601
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:27,270
That's what I'm realizing now, Stanley.

2602
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:27,730
Not at all.

2603
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:31,350
I'm realizing that I needed to know that someone was listening.

2604
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:31,930
Oh.

2605
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:35,450
I needed there to be a vessel through which my words were moving.

2606
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:35,870
Yeah.

2607
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:36,310
It was them.

2608
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:37,910
Oh.

2609
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,550
Right.

2610
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:40,850
Oh.

2611
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:40,990
Oh.

2612
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:41,490
Oh.

2613
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:43,210
Hello, it's you.

2614
01:54:43,370 --> 01:54:43,730
Hi.

2615
01:54:43,950 --> 01:54:44,410
Welcome.

2616
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:50,170
I have had time to think about you and about us and about everything we've been through.

2617
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:50,590
About us?

2618
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:54,670
I've had so much time, I stopped keeping track after a year.

2619
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:55,150
Oh, you?

2620
01:54:55,450 --> 01:54:58,630
I haven't sat down in one place and not moved for one entire year.

2621
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:00,450
Let me describe it for you.

2622
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:02,950
To begin with, there is only regret.

2623
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:03,870
What?

2624
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:05,370
He talks like we're in a relationship.

2625
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:07,850
Like, what is going on with us?

2626
01:55:07,890 --> 01:55:07,970
I feel like I'm in the corner.

2627
01:55:07,990 --> 01:55:11,890
You know, I'm sorry I ghosted you for a year, but I just can't help it, I'm a ghost!

2628
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:29,170
Well, why didn't you leave?

2629
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:32,550
You're not stuck here too, either, are you?

2630
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:43,370
A business ghost?

2631
01:55:43,610 --> 01:55:44,870
What business are we in?

2632
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:46,410
Is this the business of misery?

2633
01:55:46,810 --> 01:55:48,030
Let's take it from the top.

2634
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:01,930
Good morning!

2635
01:56:02,570 --> 01:56:03,210
Narrator!

2636
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:06,030
Has that always been there?

2637
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:07,650
Narrator?

2638
01:56:11,950 --> 01:56:12,430
Narrator?

2639
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:17,560
Narrator?

2640
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:24,050
Hello?

2641
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:26,170
I'm alive!

2642
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:27,790
Are you alive?

2643
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:32,990
I don't know how this twig is still sitting up, you know?

2644
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:34,830
Think he's dead, Jim?

2645
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:35,750
No, he's not.

2646
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:38,890
He's taking a nap at this time, too.

2647
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:40,770
I'll see him.

2648
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:42,010
I'll see him in the next skip.

2649
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:46,980
Oh, that's terrible.

2650
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,080
Oh, my God.

2651
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,160
Oh, that's terrible!

2652
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,280
That's terrible, terrible noise!

2653
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:54,060
Uh, the clock is off the wall.

2654
01:56:57,890 --> 01:56:59,110
But they didn't understand.

2655
01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:01,450
The game was never meant to be funny.

2656
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:01,850
Oh, he's alive!

2657
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:02,410
It was meant to have a point.

2658
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:04,650
It was meant to speak to the human condition.

2659
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:05,970
But where are the jokes?

2660
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:06,710
Where are the jokes?

2661
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:11,170
They bemoaned, they screamed, they gnashed their teeth and said, entertain us!

2662
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:12,230
It wasn't enough.

2663
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:17,550
They had to leave a pathetic little thumbs-down review and make all of their pitiful demands.

2664
01:57:17,810 --> 01:57:18,310
But then...

2665
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:19,410
He's talking too much, Stacy!

2666
01:57:19,410 --> 01:57:20,310
I told you he was taking a nap!

2667
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,730
First, he didn't entertain us.

2668
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:22,550
Now he won't shut up!

2669
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:23,350
Now he won't shut up!

2670
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:24,130
It's the inconsistency.

2671
01:57:24,230 --> 01:57:25,390
It's the lack of accountability.

2672
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:26,110
Yeah, okay!

2673
01:57:26,230 --> 01:57:29,470
It's the unwillingness to examine with an uncompromising heart...

2674
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:30,090
Yeah, tell them!

2675
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:31,370
Go off on them, narrator!

2676
01:57:31,610 --> 01:57:31,670
...the words that they are speaking into the world.

2677
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:32,190
Yeah!

2678
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:32,190
Yeah, shake them!

2679
01:57:32,190 --> 01:57:34,850
As though there were no consequences for a lack of cohesion in one's assessment of others.

2680
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:35,750
Shake them in their feelings!

2681
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:38,690
Tell them that they're stupid and wrong!

2682
01:57:39,050 --> 01:57:40,310
So here's what we get.

2683
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:44,010
We get these demands that seek everything and are accountable to nothing.

2684
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:47,510
We get a world where someone will say, oh, there should be a skip button.

2685
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,070
There should be a skip button!

2686
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:52,210
You should be able to freeze Stanley in place while the narrator sits there forever and ever.

2687
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:54,570
We want all of this in the new Stanley parable.

2688
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:55,130
We demand it!

2689
01:57:55,130 --> 01:57:55,750
We demand it!

2690
01:57:56,030 --> 01:58:00,630
And then, because it was said, because it was spoken, now it simply has to happen.

2691
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:01,770
You made this!

2692
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:03,470
The most immediate...

2693
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:06,770
He's asleep again.

2694
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:09,050
It's fine, you guys.

2695
01:58:09,110 --> 01:58:09,770
He's asleep again.

2696
01:58:09,950 --> 01:58:11,310
I wonder how long it's been.

2697
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:12,290
Oh.

2698
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:13,990
It takes a second.

2699
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:14,570
There we go.

2700
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:16,650
I like to check.

2701
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:18,270
I don't know if there's anything each time.

2702
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:21,090
Anything different, but I like to check.

2703
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:26,610
He was... He's still just asleep, you know?

2704
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:28,510
He's still fine.

2705
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:29,570
He's still fine.

2706
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:32,010
He just took a nap, too.

2707
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:43,410
The end is never the end, is never the end, is never the end, is never the end, is never the end, is never the end, is never the end, is never the end...

2708
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:44,810
Oh, I can finally get a drink.

2709
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:14,770
Drink!

2710
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:17,690
It's never the end, it's never the end...

2711
01:59:21,770 --> 01:59:25,790
pagi Good morning!

2712
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:28,950
Oh, it's really leaking now.

2713
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:31,650
Uh oh, it's a little bit moldy.

2714
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:34,030
Smells nasty in here.

2715
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:35,850
Why do I smell so nasty?

2716
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:43,130
I'm getting a shower.

2717
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:56,470
How long do you guys think it's been at this point?

2718
01:59:58,230 --> 01:59:59,250
How many years?

2719
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:07,280
It collapsed from the water.

2720
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,420
It's kind of dangerous, maybe.

2721
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:12,720
It's never the end.

2722
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:13,700
It's never the end.

2723
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:14,700
500?

2724
02:00:27,990 --> 02:00:29,490
I thought I was going to sneeze.

2725
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:30,850
Please, just let me sneeze!

2726
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:37,810
Sometimes I need to sneeze, and even when I need to sneeze off stream, I can't sneeze still.

2727
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:39,790
It's the worst feeling ever.

2728
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:46,520
Oh!

2729
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:49,580
It's daylight.

2730
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:53,160
Oh my god, I don't know the last time I've seen the daylight!

2731
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:54,880
Wow.

2732
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:57,850
Oh.

2733
02:00:59,330 --> 02:00:59,810
There's flies?

2734
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:04,290
Is there a dead body here?

2735
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,050
Is it me or is it attached to me?

2736
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:07,750
It's because I'm really gross.

2737
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:12,310
But I showered like 5000 years ago!

2738
02:01:12,830 --> 02:01:13,750
What's wrong?

2739
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:20,150
Why do I hear flies?

2740
02:01:22,570 --> 02:01:24,470
I showered, I showered!

2741
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:26,470
Oh!

2742
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:30,790
Whoa!

2743
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:33,270
Nature...

2744
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:35,570
Nature prevails.

2745
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:37,850
Whoa!

2746
02:01:42,450 --> 02:01:43,950
It's taken back over!

2747
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:47,930
Nature is healing!

2748
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:50,130
Tokyo Jungle.

2749
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:54,620
Oh.

2750
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:57,880
No!

2751
02:01:58,500 --> 02:01:59,460
I

2752
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:09,320
forgot how eerie this one really gets.

2753
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,500
This one's really freaky.

2754
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:18,200
So if you die before you get a chance to shower, does that mean you're forever stinky as a ghost for all eternity?

2755
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:19,460
No!

2756
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:23,240
I wash my ectoplasm almost every day.

2757
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:53,740
Stinky ghost.

2758
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:56,020
Takes one to know one.

2759
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:02,900
Whoa, why am I like sideways?

2760
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:03,380
Oh!

2761
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:05,700
I think we're sideways!

2762
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:06,780
We're crooked!

2763
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:06,860
We're crooked!

2764
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,440
Why can't we see...

2765
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,120
Why is there...

2766
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:16,340
Why can't we see through here anymore, but there's light over here?

2767
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,600
Oh, the button's down!

2768
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:20,740
The button's down!

2769
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:21,280
I repeat!

2770
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,180
The button is down!

2771
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:26,260
Oh.

2772
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:28,280
Whoa!

2773
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:32,940
Whoa!

2774
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:39,700
That's it.

2775
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:42,440
But it's okay.

2776
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,220
Life will be reborn on this lifeless planet.

2777
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:49,220
Me.

2778
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:51,260
I'll start it.

2779
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:56,500
I will spread my seed across the world.

2780
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,600
I will rebuild this planet as one.

2781
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:04,000
Everybody will become Stanley.

2782
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:06,240
Stanleyfication.

2783
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:10,980
From sea to shining sea!

2784
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,530
I think it worked!

2785
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:20,170
Good job, guys!

2786
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:24,990
What are those...

2787
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,730
What are those emojis that are happening?

2788
02:04:27,050 --> 02:04:27,930
What is that?

2789
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:29,250
Thanks for the donut, though.

2790
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:36,440
No, I don't want to be Stanley!

2791
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,840
All of his co-workers were gone.

2792
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:41,040
What could it mean?

2793
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,020
What could it mean?

2794
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:43,640
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

2795
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,440
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

2796
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:47,080
Stanley...

2797
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:47,200
Oh!

2798
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:48,620
New...

2799
02:04:48,620 --> 02:04:50,360
New content!

2800
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:53,720
I feel like...

2801
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:53,960
Okay.

2802
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,600
As silly as this sounds...

2803
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:58,940
Stanley Beyond Journey's End.

2804
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:00,800
As silly as this sounds...

2805
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,600
I don't think I've ever gotten like the normal ending.

2806
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:04,500
Like the...

2807
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:05,740
Like...

2808
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,300
We follow all his prompts.

2809
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,400
We follow everything.

2810
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,940
I don't think I've ever gotten that one before.

2811
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:18,080
I think I've always just instinctually went against the...

2812
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:19,340
The...

2813
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:19,800
The narrator.

2814
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:21,540
Let's just listen to what he has to say.

2815
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:25,040
When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.

2816
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:25,300
Yeah!

2817
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:26,060
We're gonna...

2818
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,060
We're gonna follow the rules.

2819
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:27,780
We're gonna follow...

2820
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:29,160
We're gonna be a little...

2821
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:29,600
We're gonna...

2822
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,340
We're not gonna be...

2823
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:31,420
We're not adventurous at all.

2824
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,400
I'm just a little Stanley.

2825
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,480
This is shitty Stanley.

2826
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:36,060
Yet there was not a single person here either.

2827
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:43,640
Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he might find an answer there.

2828
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,100
This is Stanley...

2829
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:48,060
Coming to a staircase, Stanley walked upstairs to his office.

2830
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:51,120
This is Stanley, the Good Stanley.

2831
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:51,840
This is...

2832
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,400
This is Timid Stanley.

2833
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:56,420
As it is written...

2834
02:05:57,080 --> 02:05:58,860
Oh, forgot about the bathroom.

2835
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:02,280
Money in the morning...

2836
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:03,480
Money in the evening...

2837
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:04,230
Money for breakfast...

2838
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,920
Money crisp...

2839
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:07,700
today.

2840
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:14,630
NPC Stanley.

2841
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:15,510
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2842
02:06:15,670 --> 02:06:16,790
Thank you for your super chat, by the way.

2843
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:17,070
Thank you.

2844
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:19,790
Stepping into his manager's office, Stanley started...

2845
02:06:24,050 --> 02:06:25,450
None.

2846
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:30,490
To nobody.

2847
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:44,350
Keypad.

2848
02:06:45,790 --> 02:06:46,570
Wow.

2849
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:56,150
Uh-oh, wait.

2850
02:06:58,130 --> 02:06:59,190
I pressed 4!

2851
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:03,870
Amazing.

2852
02:07:12,850 --> 02:07:13,770
That's kind of crazy.

2853
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:15,070
He's not talking to me at all.

2854
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:20,710
I should have put in boob.

2855
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:22,890
I should have put in boob!

2856
02:07:24,190 --> 02:07:26,210
8-0-0-8.

2857
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:40,730
Was this here before or did I just not notice it?

2858
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:44,470
Escape.

2859
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:53,560
No, no.

2860
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,000
We're NPC Stanley.

2861
02:07:55,260 --> 02:07:55,960
We're NPC Stanley.

2862
02:08:03,110 --> 02:08:03,670
Beep.

2863
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:07,550
The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens.

2864
02:08:07,650 --> 02:08:08,170
Wow.

2865
02:08:08,170 --> 02:08:10,910
What horrible secret did this place hold?

2866
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:12,450
Stanley thought to himself.

2867
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:15,210
Did he have the strength to find out?

2868
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:16,470
I almost just fell.

2869
02:08:18,290 --> 02:08:19,790
Why did they allow you?

2870
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:20,310
Oh my god.

2871
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,910
Why did they allow you to do that?

2872
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:22,970
No way.

2873
02:08:25,470 --> 02:08:26,510
Do it.

2874
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:29,790
Eee!

2875
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:36,050
Aha.

2876
02:08:36,050 --> 02:08:38,970
You've made it to the bottom of the mind control facility.

2877
02:08:39,230 --> 02:08:39,690
Welcome.

2878
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:40,670
Welcome.

2879
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:50,310
You see, back when the Stanley Parable first launched in 2013, getting to the bottom of the mind control facility was a bug that we simply didn't catch during development.

2880
02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:50,470
Oh, no way.

2881
02:08:50,810 --> 02:08:51,650
Do a flip.

2882
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:56,350
And you all sent us lots of photos of it on Twitter and acted very superior about it.

2883
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:58,570
And you're all very, very clever.

2884
02:08:58,650 --> 02:08:59,150
Good for you.

2885
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:00,150
Thank you.

2886
02:09:00,150 --> 02:09:03,830
Anyway, when it came time to update the game, we knew that we had to do something about it.

2887
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:05,290
Hmm.

2888
02:09:05,390 --> 02:09:06,050
Silly guys.

2889
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:06,890
Here you go.

2890
02:09:07,950 --> 02:09:09,070
New content.

2891
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:09,790
New content?

2892
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:16,410
You can call it the bottom of the mind control room ending if that enhances your perception of the value of these updates.

2893
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:16,830
Okay.

2894
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:16,830
Yes.

2895
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:16,990
Yes.

2896
02:09:16,990 --> 02:09:17,770
Isn't that what you crave?

2897
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:18,830
New content?

2898
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:20,050
Yes.

2899
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:21,350
Always more content.

2900
02:09:21,450 --> 02:09:22,130
More content.

2901
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:23,270
More, more, more, more, more, more.

2902
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:24,130
Oh, nom, nom, nom.

2903
02:09:24,150 --> 02:09:25,550
I'm eating all this content.

2904
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:26,270
I'm so full.

2905
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:26,730
Oh my god.

2906
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:27,930
I'm fat from content.

2907
02:09:28,050 --> 02:09:28,490
Thank you.

2908
02:09:28,650 --> 02:09:31,950
I'm here to make it seem like we've really covered every nook and cranny of the game with secrets and Easter eggs.

2909
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:33,390
How about this?

2910
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:36,790
We wrote a new piece of music just for this section.

2911
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:37,210
Ooh.

2912
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:39,510
You won't hear it anywhere else in the game.

2913
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:39,750
Okay.

2914
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:42,350
It's a secret that's just for you.

2915
02:09:42,410 --> 02:09:43,170
More, more, more.

2916
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:43,970
That's how special you are.

2917
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:47,030
We call this track, Good Job.

2918
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:49,370
You made it to the bottom of the mind control facility.

2919
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:49,850
Laugh and grow fat, Mito.

2920
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:50,990
Content and grow fat.

2921
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:56,170
You did it.

2922
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:57,150
Good job.

2923
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:58,250
You did it.

2924
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,750
Me?

2925
02:10:00,650 --> 02:10:01,130
Yeah.

2926
02:10:02,190 --> 02:10:02,670
Yeah.

2927
02:10:04,070 --> 02:10:05,650
Three, two, one.

2928
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:06,850
Good job.

2929
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:10,950
You made it to the bottom of the mind control facility.

2930
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:12,130
Ooh.

2931
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:14,750
You jumped on the catwalk.

2932
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:16,990
You should have been careful.

2933
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:18,530
I should have been careful.

2934
02:10:19,470 --> 02:10:21,630
It used to be a bug.

2935
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:22,310
A bug.

2936
02:10:22,690 --> 02:10:23,530
But now it's an ending.

2937
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:25,110
Yeah, now it's ending.

2938
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:28,070
I believe in you.

2939
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:31,590
I believe in your ability to cross this barrier.

2940
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:33,850
And chase your dreams.

2941
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:37,690
But railings don't mean anything.

2942
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:39,110
Good job.

2943
02:10:39,110 --> 02:10:39,870
You did it.

2944
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:40,690
Good job.

2945
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:41,530
You did it.

2946
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:42,410
Good job.

2947
02:10:42,450 --> 02:10:43,110
You did it.

2948
02:10:43,110 --> 02:10:43,910
Good job.

2949
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:44,770
You did it.

2950
02:10:44,790 --> 02:10:45,630
Good job.

2951
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:46,390
You did it.

2952
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:47,030
Good job.

2953
02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:48,010
You did it.

2954
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:48,730
Good job.

2955
02:10:48,870 --> 02:10:49,510
You did it.

2956
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:50,450
Good job.

2957
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:51,290
You did it.

2958
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:52,050
Good job.

2959
02:10:52,050 --> 02:10:52,830
You did it.

2960
02:10:52,870 --> 02:10:53,390
Good job.

2961
02:10:53,630 --> 02:10:54,430
You did it.

2962
02:10:54,430 --> 02:10:54,950
Good job.

2963
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:54,950
You did it.

2964
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:55,430
Good job.

2965
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:56,030
You did it.

2966
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:56,030
Good job.

2967
02:10:56,030 --> 02:10:56,150
You did it.

2968
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:56,990
Good job.

2969
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:57,050
You did it.

2970
02:10:57,050 --> 02:10:57,050
Good job.

2971
02:10:57,150 --> 02:10:57,150
You did it.

2972
02:10:57,150 --> 02:10:57,150
Good job.

2973
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:57,190
You did it.

2974
02:10:57,190 --> 02:10:57,190
Good job.

2975
02:10:57,190 --> 02:10:57,210
You did it.

2976
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:57,210
Good job.

2977
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:57,470
You did it.

2978
02:10:57,990 --> 02:11:00,210
Good job.

2979
02:11:03,190 --> 02:11:03,740
You did it.

2980
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:05,960
I didn't get the normal ending.

2981
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:12,780
I thought he would teleport me back or something, you know?

2982
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:14,400
Oopsie.

2983
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,100
Good job!

2984
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:15,940
You did it!

2985
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:16,740
Good job!

2986
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:17,480
You did it!

2987
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:22,420
So glad I made a sequel to You Have to Burn the Rope.

2988
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:26,400
Okay, la la la, we're gonna get the normal ending this time!

2989
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:28,280
NPC mission failed!

2990
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:29,440
No, no.

2991
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:31,620
He entered the door on his left.

2992
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:35,280
On his left, on his left, on his left.

2993
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:37,020
Then we'll go to the new new content.

2994
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,100
Yet there was not a single person here either.

2995
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:42,540
I think the new new content is where...

2996
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:44,460
Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office.

2997
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:48,340
I think that's where I broke the game before.

2998
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:57,820
The moment he entered his manager's office, Stanley froze in his tracks.

2999
02:11:58,420 --> 02:11:58,900
Wait.

3000
02:11:59,820 --> 02:12:00,920
I messed up.

3001
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:03,000
Could he really be all alone?

3002
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:05,720
This was too much for Stanley to take.

3003
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:06,660
Too much for...

3004
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:10,320
Stanley was in such a rush to get through the story as quickly as possible...

3005
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:10,600
Come on!

3006
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:14,040
He didn't even have a single minute to just let the narrator talk.

3007
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,440
No time to talk, buddy!

3008
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:16,840
No time to talk!

3009
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:17,400
Boo!

3010
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:18,680
Boo!

3011
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,080
Boo!

3012
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:21,400
With some calming New Age music...

3013
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:21,480
Okay.

3014
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:25,680
We're getting the whole soundtrack this time.

3015
02:12:34,370 --> 02:12:37,950
Feeling soothed and rejuvenated, Stanley calmly walked forward...

3016
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:39,070
Did you get the broom closet ending?

3017
02:12:39,190 --> 02:12:39,990
My favorite!

3018
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:40,830
Oh!

3019
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:42,530
The broom closet ending!

3020
02:12:42,850 --> 02:12:43,970
My favorite!

3021
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:46,170
Please, sir.

3022
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:48,350
Can I have another broom closet ending?

3023
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:56,330
It wouldn't let you speed run it.

3024
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:57,710
Oh, not at all.

3025
02:12:57,910 --> 02:12:58,350
It's okay.

3026
02:12:59,410 --> 02:13:00,170
I get it.

3027
02:13:00,250 --> 02:13:02,390
They're keeping to a very strict schedule.

3028
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:02,950
I get it.

3029
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:08,550
Stanley walked straight ahead through the large door that read, Mind Control Facility.

3030
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:10,570
Oh, it's really tempting.

3031
02:13:14,190 --> 02:13:16,170
It's written in Koran and everything.

3032
02:13:16,290 --> 02:13:17,590
You know it was hastily done.

3033
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:21,550
This is fine.

3034
02:13:22,670 --> 02:13:23,610
That's fine.

3035
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:25,290
Okay, push the button.

3036
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:25,990
Alright.

3037
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:27,450
True NPC ending.

3038
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:28,270
Here we go!

3039
02:13:28,390 --> 02:13:31,270
The lights rose on an enormous room packed with television screens.

3040
02:13:31,570 --> 02:13:32,930
What horrible things.

3041
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:34,570
What little secret did this place hold?

3042
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:36,210
Stanley thought to himself.

3043
02:13:36,430 --> 02:13:38,590
Did he have the strength to find out?

3044
02:13:38,590 --> 02:13:40,890
I kind of want to hear this song again, but I won't do it.

3045
02:13:49,090 --> 02:13:50,190
Sorry, you guys.

3046
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:51,130
Crayon!

3047
02:13:51,130 --> 02:13:52,090
Okay, are you happy?

3048
02:13:52,810 --> 02:13:53,890
Oh my god.

3049
02:13:55,050 --> 02:14:00,490
I can't say anything without getting judged by your insignificant details.

3050
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:03,050
Now the monitors jump to life.

3051
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:04,510
Their true nature revealed.

3052
02:14:04,510 --> 02:14:06,210
I never saw this before.

3053
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:07,970
A number of an employee in the building.

3054
02:14:08,510 --> 02:14:09,630
Stanley's co-workers.

3055
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:14,030
The lives of so many individuals reduced to images on a screen.

3056
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:14,610
Reduced?

3057
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:16,990
They've been reduced.

3058
02:14:18,190 --> 02:14:20,370
Where freedom meant nothing.

3059
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:22,350
What is that one right there?

3060
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:24,330
The one that's blue.

3061
02:14:25,330 --> 02:14:26,750
Oh, it's just kind of normal.

3062
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:28,850
Reduced to nothing.

3063
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:38,450
What's this?

3064
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:40,850
A control facility.

3065
02:14:41,390 --> 02:14:43,170
It was too horrible to believe.

3066
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:44,230
It couldn't be true.

3067
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:45,610
Well, where are they?

3068
02:14:45,710 --> 02:14:47,970
Have you been under someone's control all this time?

3069
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:51,350
Was this the only reason he was happy with his boring job?

3070
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:55,250
That his emotions had been manipulated to accept it blindly?

3071
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:56,390
No.

3072
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:57,190
No.

3073
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,670
I love my job.

3074
02:15:00,070 --> 02:15:00,710
No.

3075
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:02,790
He refused to believe it.

3076
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:04,470
He couldn't accept it.

3077
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:07,430
His own life in someone else's control?

3078
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:08,610
Never.

3079
02:15:08,610 --> 02:15:09,230
Never?

3080
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:11,430
It was unthinkable, wasn't it?

3081
02:15:11,590 --> 02:15:12,910
Was it even possible?

3082
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:14,310
My life?

3083
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:15,950
I control my own fate.

3084
02:15:16,410 --> 02:15:18,710
Utterly blind to the world?

3085
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:23,330
But here was the proof.

3086
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:24,850
The heart of the operation.

3087
02:15:25,710 --> 02:15:27,290
Controls labeled with emotions.

3088
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:30,410
Happy or sad or content.

3089
02:15:30,910 --> 02:15:32,890
Walking, eating, working.

3090
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:33,650
They controlled everything.

3091
02:15:34,070 --> 02:15:36,410
All of it monitored and commanded from this very place.

3092
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:40,030
And as the cold reality of his past, began to sink in.

3093
02:15:40,190 --> 02:15:47,250
Stanley decided that this machinery would never again exert its terrible power over another human life.

3094
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:48,550
Never again.

3095
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:52,770
For he would dismantle the controls once and for all.

3096
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:57,030
Mind controls idle awaiting input.

3097
02:15:58,380 --> 02:15:59,650
But who stopped it?

3098
02:16:00,590 --> 02:16:02,650
I need a Stanley Parable 2.

3099
02:16:02,770 --> 02:16:04,530
A prequel to this.

3100
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:07,630
Uh-oh.

3101
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:12,930
Don't give me a choice here.

3102
02:16:15,610 --> 02:16:16,650
The Patriots.

3103
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:29,000
MPC Mint, remember?

3104
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:30,020
You're right, you're right.

3105
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:32,760
Scared me.

3106
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:34,840
MPC!

3107
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:35,360
MPC!

3108
02:16:43,430 --> 02:16:44,650
Shut down GW.

3109
02:16:45,030 --> 02:16:47,690
We went through a microwave tunnel for this.

3110
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:49,750
Was it over?

3111
02:16:49,970 --> 02:16:50,670
Was it over?

3112
02:16:54,570 --> 02:16:54,930
Yes.

3113
02:16:55,670 --> 02:16:56,870
He had won.

3114
02:16:57,090 --> 02:16:59,070
He had defeated the machine.

3115
02:16:59,970 --> 02:17:02,690
Unshackled himself from someone else's command.

3116
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:05,590
Freedom was mere moments away.

3117
02:17:06,630 --> 02:17:14,530
And yet, even as the immense door slowly opened, Stanley reflected on how many puzzles still lay unsolved.

3118
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:17,150
Where had his co-workers gone?

3119
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:20,410
How had he been freed from the machine's grasp?

3120
02:17:20,810 --> 02:17:23,730
What other mysteries did this strange building hold?

3121
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:29,590
But as sunlight streamed into the chamber, he realized none of this mattered to him.

3122
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:35,190
For it was not knowledge or even power that he had been seeking, but happiness.

3123
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:39,870
Perhaps his goal had not been to understand, but to let go.

3124
02:17:40,590 --> 02:17:45,810
No longer would anyone tell him where to go, what to do, or how to feel.

3125
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:49,710
Whatever life he lives, it will be his.

3126
02:17:50,310 --> 02:17:52,730
And that was all he needed to know.

3127
02:17:53,130 --> 02:17:56,650
It was, perhaps, the only thing worth knowing.

3128
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:57,450
Let me out.

3129
02:17:57,710 --> 02:17:59,850
Stanley stepped through the open door.

3130
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:04,630
Grass.

3131
02:18:04,810 --> 02:18:06,390
Oh, I didn't even do anything.

3132
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:09,110
The feeling of liberation.

3133
02:18:09,650 --> 02:18:13,490
The immense possibility of the new path before him.

3134
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:13,570
That's beautiful.

3135
02:18:13,570 --> 02:18:19,390
This was exactly the way, right now, that things were meant to happen.

3136
02:18:19,670 --> 02:18:20,270
Wow.

3137
02:18:20,410 --> 02:18:23,070
And Stanley was happy.

3138
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:26,270
Wow, it's like a...

3139
02:18:26,270 --> 02:18:28,730
Actually, it's just like a wholesome...

3140
02:18:29,830 --> 02:18:31,870
Complete the Stanley Parable.

3141
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:33,310
Maybe we should have done this last.

3142
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:38,930
It's actually like such a nice ending.

3143
02:18:39,050 --> 02:18:39,610
Wow.

3144
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:41,590
It's like so like...

3145
02:18:43,570 --> 02:18:44,810
Stanley was happy.

3146
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:48,490
Oh, well, back in the office for you, bozo.

3147
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:51,090
You can never leave the office alive.

3148
02:18:51,090 --> 02:18:54,330
Just a step through this door, Stanley thought to himself, that's all I need.

3149
02:18:54,570 --> 02:18:57,850
If I can make it through this door, I can make it through them all.

3150
02:18:58,790 --> 02:18:59,370
Wait, what?

3151
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:01,770
Can I?

3152
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:02,270
No.

3153
02:19:03,350 --> 02:19:06,230
Stanley went around touching every little thing in the office.

3154
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:07,630
You just told me I can go through the doors.

3155
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:08,270
But it didn't make a single difference.

3156
02:19:08,670 --> 02:19:11,490
Nor did it advance the story in any way.

3157
02:19:11,490 --> 02:19:13,450
New, new content.

3158
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:16,730
Oh, good.

3159
02:19:16,870 --> 02:19:18,130
You noticed my sign.

3160
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:18,530
I did.

3161
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:18,910
I did.

3162
02:19:19,050 --> 02:19:21,310
Yes, I have something very exciting to show you.

3163
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:21,630
Okay.

3164
02:19:22,650 --> 02:19:23,250
Through here?

3165
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:23,750
Through here?

3166
02:19:28,610 --> 02:19:29,010
Okay.

3167
02:19:29,610 --> 02:19:31,470
Alright, we're going through our little ride again.

3168
02:19:31,570 --> 02:19:31,990
Love it.

3169
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:33,870
New, new content.

3170
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:41,700
Wait, but I wanted to see the...

3171
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:44,060
I wanted to see the ride again.

3172
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:49,580
World turning the button on results in...

3173
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:50,020
Mintification?

3174
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:52,180
I've been reflecting on the Stanley Parable.

3175
02:19:52,300 --> 02:19:57,180
And about how roundly disappointing this Ultra Deluxe version has turned out to be.

3176
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,840
The original Stanley Parable was a landmark.

3177
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:03,180
And any new content for it should live up to that legacy.

3178
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:06,040
So forget this Ultra Deluxe nonsense.

3179
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:10,060
I say we take it one step even further.

3180
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:14,400
Which is why I'm very proud to announce for the first time ever...

3181
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:15,520
Is this supposed to look like this?

3182
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:17,580
The Stanley Parable 2.

3183
02:20:18,220 --> 02:20:18,740
Two!

3184
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:24,900
Oh, I think I remember this part.

3185
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:28,800
Far superior to a measly re-release with a few minor additions.

3186
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:32,780
Think of all the new territory we'll cover with a fully fledged sequel.

3187
02:20:32,980 --> 02:20:36,100
An entirely new experience built from the ground up.

3188
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,760
Why there are so many possibilities.

3189
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:40,300
It could go in so many different directions.

3190
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:40,700
Two, two, that's me.

3191
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:43,540
This is what fans have truly been asking for.

3192
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:44,500
Investor Showcase!

3193
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:46,640
Oh, yeah, baby.

3194
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:51,460
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two.

3195
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:54,980
Okay.

3196
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:01,300
Calling it the Stanley Parable 2 is just so much catchier than Ultra Deluxe, don't you think?

3197
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:02,060
Sure.

3198
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,740
Ultra Deluxe?

3199
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,200
What does it even mean?

3200
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:06,500
But the Stanley Parable 2.

3201
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:07,060
Off page.

3202
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:10,080
Now that's an artistic statement right there.

3203
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:11,740
What's a TGA file?

3204
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:12,700
It's future oriented.

3205
02:21:12,700 --> 02:21:17,120
It means progress and innovation and long term franchising potential.

3206
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:20,200
Potential.

3207
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,040
Potential.

3208
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:22,260
Targa.

3209
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,360
What's Targa?

3210
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:26,800
Type of... texture file.

3211
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:28,460
Interesting.

3212
02:21:33,460 --> 02:21:35,620
Wow, this is so fancy.

3213
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:38,220
It's like a whole new...

3214
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:40,520
Like, I mean, it is a whole new office.

3215
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:46,800
We got modern stone concrete wall aesthetic and they're back.

3216
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:47,860
The two doors.

3217
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:50,320
I love those guys.

3218
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,340
I love

3219
02:21:57,450 --> 02:21:58,690
those guys.

3220
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:00,710
New content is out.

3221
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:02,910
New content part two is it.

3222
02:22:06,730 --> 02:22:07,610
What's this?

3223
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:09,530
Sequel ideas.

3224
02:22:09,910 --> 02:22:11,550
Stanley can throw axes?

3225
02:22:13,310 --> 02:22:18,310
Stanley gets boons from fish?

3226
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:21,270
Artistic.

3227
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:24,650
Intimate wipe scene.

3228
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:30,670
Free room.

3229
02:22:30,830 --> 02:22:31,950
Oh, free roam.

3230
02:22:32,070 --> 02:22:33,310
Free roam made.

3231
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:35,730
More famous narrator.

3232
02:22:35,810 --> 02:22:36,670
That one's crossed out.

3233
02:22:39,130 --> 02:22:40,810
Dress up mode.

3234
02:22:40,810 --> 02:22:41,090
Code.

3235
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:42,590
Noob.

3236
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:43,510
Microtransactions.

3237
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:44,370
Microtransactions.

3238
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:44,710
Very good.

3239
02:22:44,830 --> 02:22:45,790
Proper gameplay?

3240
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:47,670
Noob.

3241
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:48,370
Stanley.

3242
02:22:49,570 --> 02:22:50,730
New York City.

3243
02:22:51,610 --> 02:22:52,030
Jetpack.

3244
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:53,990
Fuel canisters?

3245
02:22:57,370 --> 02:23:01,910
Whoever wrote this is on to something great.

3246
02:23:04,450 --> 02:23:06,150
Whoever wrote that...

3247
02:23:06,570 --> 02:23:08,050
Oh, I can't read the two.

3248
02:23:09,250 --> 02:23:11,990
Meeting at 2 p.m..

3249
02:23:11,990 --> 02:23:14,110
Yeah,

3250
02:23:17,710 --> 02:23:19,390
I'm needing some of these.

3251
02:23:20,890 --> 02:23:25,190
Especially the... several of them.

3252
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:28,210
More TSP.

3253
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:30,070
Better TSP.

3254
02:23:30,710 --> 02:23:33,010
Paradigm Shift S-Energy.

3255
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:35,290
Brick and Mortar Approach.

3256
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:37,090
The color red.

3257
02:23:38,810 --> 02:23:40,290
Sequential Mindshare.

3258
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:42,890
Win-win.

3259
02:23:45,490 --> 02:23:46,650
The ferns!

3260
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:47,430
The ferns!

3261
02:23:47,430 --> 02:23:48,150
The ferns!

3262
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:48,330
Wait.

3263
02:23:48,790 --> 02:23:51,050
I don't know anything about... Oh my gosh.

3264
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:52,090
Look at that.

3265
02:23:52,530 --> 02:23:55,930
Oh, I kinda like this one down here.

3266
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:59,590
I kinda like the Stanley Parable with the two lines inside.

3267
02:24:00,050 --> 02:24:01,370
Thanks for attending my meeting.

3268
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:03,450
The other ones are whatever.

3269
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:07,850
The second one reminds me of Red Dead Redemption, I think.

3270
02:24:11,190 --> 02:24:13,630
I never had an ending with the ferns.

3271
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:22,200
Oh, I thought this was nude Stanley.

3272
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:28,200
Now to be clear, I haven't quite nailed down what exactly the Stanley Parable 2 is going to be.

3273
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:32,100
But let's take a look at some of the features I've been developing for it.

3274
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:32,720
Okay.

3275
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:41,020
I figure that if I can loosely organize a handful of interesting concepts, that surely the game will sort of naturally spring up around them.

3276
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,720
It'll all work itself out.

3277
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:47,740
Game development is much more of a fuzzy magic than anything scientific or logical.

3278
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:48,260
This is so relatable.

3279
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:51,340
Two eyes.

3280
02:24:51,540 --> 02:24:52,860
Two ears.

3281
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,620
Two nostrils.

3282
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:56,100
Two arms.

3283
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:57,300
Two legs.

3284
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:01,220
What the perfect Stanley.

3285
02:25:03,960 --> 02:25:06,020
The end is never the end again!

3286
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:13,600
Stanley Parable 2, now with blockchain and AI.

3287
02:25:14,340 --> 02:25:14,900
Noooo!

3288
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:17,620
Sequels are good!

3289
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:23,300
Portal 2, Half-Life 2, Batman Arkham Asylum 2, Metal Gear Solid 2...

3290
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:25,680
Doom 2...

3291
02:25:26,340 --> 02:25:27,280
Divinity Original...

3292
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:27,820
Original Sin 2?

3293
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:30,700
Aladdin 2?

3294
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:31,380
Return of Jafar?

3295
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:32,340
Dark Souls 2?

3296
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:41,680
Hmm...

3297
02:25:43,380 --> 02:25:44,420
Doom 2...

3298
02:25:46,460 --> 02:25:48,880
The prequel to the Stanley Parable.

3299
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:51,400
2 is the sequel to the Stanley Parable.

3300
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:53,280
Is the prequel to the Stanley Parable.

3301
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:56,400
2 is the sequel to the Stanley Parable.

3302
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:57,260
Is the prequel...

3303
02:25:57,260 --> 02:25:57,900
2.

3304
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:58,400
2.

3305
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,540
Nice...

3306
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:07,440
Every pause button is a Roman numeral 2.

3307
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:08,840
Every pause button is a Roman numeral 2.

3308
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:12,020
The show floor.

3309
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:13,720
Wow!

3310
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,000
Yeah!

3311
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:21,090
Thank you!

3312
02:26:22,410 --> 02:26:23,310
Thank you!

3313
02:26:23,390 --> 02:26:25,610
What are you wearing tonight, Mint?

3314
02:26:25,970 --> 02:26:29,470
I'm wearing your mom's dress from last night!

3315
02:26:29,570 --> 02:26:29,710
I'm wearing your mom's dress from last night!

3316
02:26:29,710 --> 02:26:30,070
Thank you!

3317
02:26:30,330 --> 02:26:31,190
Thank you!

3318
02:26:31,690 --> 02:26:32,370
Thank you!

3319
02:26:32,430 --> 02:26:35,780
No other questions!

3320
02:26:36,020 --> 02:26:36,900
Thank you so much!

3321
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:37,380
Thank you!

3322
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,800
Oh god.

3323
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:50,110
Wow!

3324
02:26:51,290 --> 02:26:53,150
I do remember this part a little bit.

3325
02:26:55,390 --> 02:26:57,690
Hear your name in the game.

3326
02:27:00,030 --> 02:27:03,370
The button that says the name of the player that is playing the game!

3327
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:10,170
For the Stanley Parable 2, I asked myself what do players really want?

3328
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:18,190
And of course, The first and most obvious answer is that they want to be individually recognized and validated as people.

3329
02:27:18,730 --> 02:27:26,350
So with that in mind, my first addition to the game is this button which speaks the name of the person playing the game.

3330
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:27,910
Isn't that wonderful?

3331
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:35,750
I remember the last time this did not say my name.

3332
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:56,200
Thanks for the super chat, I'm glad I could make you smile.

3333
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:58,920
It's gonna say Mint.

3334
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:03,560
And if it doesn't say any... if it says anything else...

3335
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:07,780
If it says anything else, it's the Doc's button.

3336
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:08,920
You guys are scaring me.

3337
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:11,520
It's going to say Mint.

3338
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:13,100
Going to say Mint.

3339
02:28:14,120 --> 02:28:14,640
Jim.

3340
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,180
Sorry, I should have clarified.

3341
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:20,440
Right now, the button only says the name Jim.

3342
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:25,380
But of course, in the final game, this button will say your name, whatever name that is.

3343
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,100
Here.

3344
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:31,020
Let's have you roleplay as Jim to really simulate the full experience of this feature.

3345
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:32,620
Just fail me.

3346
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,800
I promise you'll love it.

3347
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:35,360
Okay, here we go.

3348
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:36,640
Let's take a deep breath.

3349
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:37,940
Clear your mind.

3350
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,720
Forget whoever you are.

3351
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:42,100
And simply become a person named Jim.

3352
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:45,820
I want you to imagine yourself living as Jim.

3353
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:47,880
Sleeping and waking as Jim.

3354
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:51,160
Falling in love and being heartbroken as Jim.

3355
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:54,380
Seizing all of the world's possibilities as Jim.

3356
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,120
And as Jim.

3357
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:57,420
Watching your dreams crumble into dust.

3358
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:59,280
Do you feel it deeply?

3359
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:02,080
Are you really, truly Jim right now?

3360
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:02,420
I think so.

3361
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:03,000
I'm Jim.

3362
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,940
If so, then please step forward and press the button.

3363
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:06,460
I'm Jim.

3364
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:08,860
I'm Jim.

3365
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:10,960
Jim!

3366
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:13,220
Yes!

3367
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,200
You see!

3368
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:15,260
What a thrill!

3369
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:16,000
What a thrill!

3370
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:16,020
What a rush!

3371
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:16,620
That was you!

3372
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:17,700
What a thrill!

3373
02:29:17,700 --> 02:29:18,440
The button described you.

3374
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:19,180
Do it again.

3375
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:19,580
Do it again.

3376
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:30,940
I think I'm really starting to, like, you know, it's one of those, like, think it till you believe it sort of things, you know, like...

3377
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:32,480
Jim.

3378
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:35,680
It hits even harder the second time.

3379
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:40,740
If this were the only new feature in The Stanley Parable 2, it would still be worth the money.

3380
02:29:41,260 --> 02:29:43,040
Let's take a break from the Jim button.

3381
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:46,460
I'm too emotionally drained from all of this personal validation.

3382
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:49,900
Hold on.

3383
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:52,420
I'm just changing the stream title a little bit.

3384
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:55,420
There we go.

3385
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,040
Cool.

3386
02:29:56,200 --> 02:29:56,540
Jim.

3387
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:58,320
Whoa there, cowboy.

3388
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:00,920
Sometimes a person can be too much Jim.

3389
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:03,100
I'm putting the Jim button away.

3390
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:03,520
No!

3391
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:07,580
Otherwise, soon you'll start to lose all sense of who you actually are.

3392
02:30:08,220 --> 02:30:08,760
Jim.

3393
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:08,800
Jim.

3394
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:08,800
Jim.

3395
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:08,800
Jim.

3396
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:11,000
You can't stop me!

3397
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:12,880
You can't deny me!

3398
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,800
You can't deny me my identity!

3399
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:21,770
Anyway...

3400
02:30:23,810 --> 02:30:24,910
I felt good.

3401
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:28,110
I felt good, you know, when I...

3402
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:34,030
When I died, there were some things that I lost, some memories, you know, but now I feel...

3403
02:30:34,030 --> 02:30:41,950
I feel this post-Jim clarity that I just never thought that I would ever, you know, feel.

3404
02:30:44,630 --> 02:30:46,010
It's the dead tree.

3405
02:30:48,730 --> 02:30:49,610
It's still here.

3406
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:49,690
It's still here.

3407
02:30:52,050 --> 02:30:56,330
I suppose I could allow only people named Jim to play the Stanley Parable 2.

3408
02:30:56,510 --> 02:30:56,690
True.

3409
02:30:56,750 --> 02:30:59,210
That would actually save me the work of finishing this feature.

3410
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:02,830
Don't be lazy, narrator.

3411
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:03,710
Don't be la...

3412
02:31:03,710 --> 02:31:05,010
No screenshots, everybody.

3413
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:08,190
Whole new office.

3414
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:11,070
999.

3415
02:31:11,290 --> 02:31:12,530
Red is the new...

3416
02:31:16,330 --> 02:31:18,010
Is that coming from the game?

3417
02:31:19,210 --> 02:31:20,990
Wait, is that from me or...

3418
02:31:24,030 --> 02:31:25,070
Jimperms revoked.

3419
02:31:27,970 --> 02:31:29,010
New features.

3420
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:30,030
New content.

3421
02:31:30,130 --> 02:31:30,710
New ideas.

3422
02:31:32,290 --> 02:31:33,610
New updated rate.

3423
02:31:33,670 --> 02:31:36,930
Traced more of the same but in a good way, sequel to the...

3424
02:31:41,370 --> 02:31:42,750
Okay, I think it's in the game.

3425
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:44,030
Oh my god, that scared me.

3426
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:45,430
The baby!

3427
02:31:46,750 --> 02:31:47,930
The button baby!

3428
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:48,690
Button ba...

3429
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:50,490
Baby is all grown...

3430
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:52,550
Button baby!

3431
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:53,930
Button baby!

3432
02:31:54,150 --> 02:31:54,430
Button baby!

3433
02:31:54,430 --> 02:31:54,690
Cuttin' baby!

3434
02:31:56,930 --> 02:32:00,030
Consistent quality with just the right amount of change.

3435
02:32:02,550 --> 02:32:03,830
Schwing shaders.

3436
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:06,390
Oh, the bucket!

3437
02:32:08,930 --> 02:32:10,070
No screenshots.

3438
02:32:10,570 --> 02:32:11,210
Is that?

3439
02:32:11,430 --> 02:32:12,350
Oh my god, it's me!

3440
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:13,470
Wow, I'm tall!

3441
02:32:14,530 --> 02:32:17,530
I grew like an extra foot or so.

3442
02:32:17,530 --> 02:32:17,970
So...

3443
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:22,090
We got collectibles.

3444
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:24,530
Turning me into a U2s.

3445
02:32:25,070 --> 02:32:27,890
Oh yeah, Stanley U2s!

3446
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:32,070
Free, new and easy achievement.

3447
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:37,760
Can you find them?

3448
02:32:39,620 --> 02:32:40,820
Collect them all.

3449
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,860
We all run around gathering up these miniature Stanley figurines.

3450
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:58,080
And what's truly innovative is that there will be no reward for collecting all of them.

3451
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:02,120
I don't want to stifle the intrinsic joy of watching a number go up.

3452
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:07,060
You simply collect all of them and then you move the hell on with your unremarkable life.

3453
02:33:08,220 --> 02:33:08,780
How

3454
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:26,180
am I gonna become like that?

3455
02:33:30,380 --> 02:33:30,940
Oh!

3456
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:32,240
Yippee!

3457
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:42,270
Get me out of there.

3458
02:33:42,730 --> 02:33:49,290
God, it really is the worst when you collect everything in a video game and then they give you a big fancy reward for it.

3459
02:33:49,690 --> 02:33:50,510
Absolutely tragic.

3460
02:33:51,410 --> 02:33:52,290
Absolutely tragic.

3461
02:33:53,210 --> 02:33:55,110
So true, so true, so true.

3462
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:56,750
I don't need a reward.

3463
02:33:57,130 --> 02:33:58,430
I don't want anything.

3464
02:34:00,910 --> 02:34:03,250
Scooty Puff Jr. Thanks for the donation.

3465
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:05,310
$10.

3466
02:34:05,590 --> 02:34:06,470
Thank you for the donation.

3467
02:34:06,550 --> 02:34:07,130
Oh my god, my brain.

3468
02:34:07,370 --> 02:34:08,030
Thank you!

3469
02:34:10,190 --> 02:34:10,570
Jump circle.

3470
02:34:10,970 --> 02:34:12,310
Oh, we had that, we had that.

3471
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:14,190
This map, free achievement.

3472
02:34:15,010 --> 02:34:16,510
Where do we get the achievement at?

3473
02:34:18,030 --> 02:34:18,470
Q.

3474
02:34:20,970 --> 02:34:22,070
So, what's N?

3475
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:25,110
N is the jump circle.

3476
02:34:25,890 --> 02:34:27,570
This is the jump circle, right?

3477
02:34:29,490 --> 02:34:30,470
Oh, there it is.

3478
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:31,730
There's a sign for it.

3479
02:34:31,950 --> 02:34:32,770
You know what, Stanley?

3480
02:34:32,970 --> 02:34:35,750
I actually think the jump circle was a pretty good idea.

3481
02:34:36,110 --> 02:34:37,410
I'd like to hang on to that for the sequel.

3482
02:34:37,530 --> 02:34:39,150
Oh, this is the 10 that I have left.

3483
02:34:42,730 --> 02:34:43,210
Nice.

3484
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:49,260
Free achievement.

3485
02:34:52,950 --> 02:34:55,150
Pull the lever, receive your new achievement.

3486
02:34:55,190 --> 02:34:56,490
No more steps, it just works.

3487
02:34:58,210 --> 02:34:59,870
Now, here's something special.

3488
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:03,770
You remember that broken test achievement that got left in the game on accident?

3489
02:35:04,030 --> 02:35:04,230
Yeah.

3490
02:35:04,290 --> 02:35:07,850
Well, I'm developing a technology to simply give you the achievement.

3491
02:35:08,190 --> 02:35:08,670
Yes.

3492
02:35:08,810 --> 02:35:09,250
Wow.

3493
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:13,570
You see, you'll come to this lever, and when you pull it, the achievement will be given to you.

3494
02:35:13,570 --> 02:35:15,890
Okay, perhaps I should have clarified.

3495
02:35:16,190 --> 02:35:17,930
This is technology that will exist.

3496
02:35:18,170 --> 02:35:21,010
Right now, the achievement is still fully broken.

3497
02:35:21,230 --> 02:35:24,890
I'm not a wizard, Stanley, but I guarantee it will be fixed in the future.

3498
02:35:24,890 --> 02:35:25,670
Come on, narrator.

3499
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:28,810
You're busting my balls here, narrator.

3500
02:35:29,390 --> 02:35:29,890
Please.

3501
02:35:32,230 --> 02:35:33,930
Gamers, we hear you.

3502
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:34,490
Gamers.

3503
02:35:34,510 --> 02:35:35,530
And I promise it will happen.

3504
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:36,490
Rise up, gamers.

3505
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:43,630
I cannot believe this.

3506
02:35:43,630 --> 02:35:44,990
What else?

3507
02:35:45,310 --> 02:35:47,290
What other exhibits haven't we seen yet?

3508
02:35:48,050 --> 02:35:48,950
The bucket?

3509
02:35:49,410 --> 02:35:50,270
What's in here?

3510
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:53,390
Okay, I'll be honest.

3511
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:55,150
I haven't yet decided on this one.

3512
02:35:55,230 --> 02:35:55,590
What is this?

3513
02:35:55,830 --> 02:36:00,770
I think that in the new version, the office could use a bit of decoration, like balloons.

3514
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:06,310
But I've undecided on get well someday and happy 12th birthday.

3515
02:36:06,450 --> 02:36:07,790
Which would you go with?

3516
02:36:08,250 --> 02:36:10,390
I think I'd get well someday.

3517
02:36:11,430 --> 02:36:12,030
Okay.

3518
02:36:12,590 --> 02:36:12,890
Okay.

3519
02:36:12,890 --> 02:36:20,950
You know, sometimes when you solicit another person's opinion, it makes you realize that you knew which one you actually really wanted all along.

3520
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:22,190
I hate you, narrator.

3521
02:36:22,190 --> 02:36:24,490
Happy 12th birthday, step-niece it is.

3522
02:36:24,570 --> 02:36:25,590
I hate you, narrator.

3523
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:29,230
This one is stuck.

3524
02:36:31,110 --> 02:36:34,130
This one... this one won't even... this one...

3525
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:35,710
Okay.

3526
02:36:35,950 --> 02:36:36,570
Oh my god!

3527
02:36:40,170 --> 02:36:43,270
Or actually, maybe I should have gone with... no.

3528
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:44,010
No?

3529
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:45,310
I've made my decision.

3530
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:46,290
We're moving on.

3531
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:47,650
We're moving on.

3532
02:36:49,610 --> 02:36:52,170
The end is never the end is never the end.

3533
02:36:55,010 --> 02:36:55,990
Would you wear these?

3534
02:36:56,010 --> 02:36:59,350
This t-shirt is the new... is the best new feature.

3535
02:36:59,690 --> 02:37:01,550
I saw the new content.

3536
02:37:01,730 --> 02:37:02,330
Oh, the bucket!

3537
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:02,750
That's right.

3538
02:37:04,450 --> 02:37:05,490
Let's go get our bucket.

3539
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,790
That code works?

3540
02:37:08,010 --> 02:37:08,670
Wait, what code?

3541
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:12,050
Which one?

3542
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:13,470
I didn't see a code.

3543
02:37:16,770 --> 02:37:17,790
Oh, the QR code.

3544
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:20,270
Oh, I don't have my phone on me, you guys.

3545
02:37:20,350 --> 02:37:21,330
I don't know where my phone is.

3546
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:28,390
I think I left it somewhere.

3547
02:37:28,650 --> 02:37:30,270
I think I left it after when I was cooking.

3548
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:33,190
I'll try it here.

3549
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:35,050
I left it up there.

3550
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:36,010
Everybody else can check it.

3551
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:37,890
There you go.

3552
02:37:38,010 --> 02:37:38,770
Go ahead and scan.

3553
02:37:39,090 --> 02:37:39,790
Go ahead and scan.

3554
02:37:42,550 --> 02:37:43,870
Go ahead and scan.

3555
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:45,030
Go ahead and scan.

3556
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:49,730
The button that says Jim.

3557
02:37:49,890 --> 02:37:54,350
It looks so sad.

3558
02:38:00,910 --> 02:38:06,170
A common complaint of the Stanley Parable was that it was confusing and paradoxical.

3559
02:38:06,330 --> 02:38:10,890
That it engendered a chaotic sense of reckless despair in those who played it.

3560
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,530
Nice.

3561
02:38:11,530 --> 02:38:19,410
I'm happy to say that after much consideration, I've engineered a clever solution to this fundamental problem with the game.

3562
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:19,730
Okay.

3563
02:38:20,090 --> 02:38:23,770
It's the Stanley Parable Reassurance Bucket.

3564
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:31,210
You see, Stanley, anytime you're holding the bucket, a sense of calm and ease will fill your mind and your heart.

3565
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:31,810
It's true.

3566
02:38:32,230 --> 02:38:39,870
As long as you hold on to the bucket, the many disorienting contradictions of the Stanley Parable will feel perfectly normal.

3567
02:38:39,870 --> 02:38:41,850
And perhaps, even comforting.

3568
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:49,130
You may even come to long for the gentle embrace of jarring cognitive dissonance while the bucket is in your arms.

3569
02:38:49,310 --> 02:38:49,590
Bucket.

3570
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:56,470
And to be honest, it's a much more convenient solution for me than actually redesigning the game to be less uncomfortable.

3571
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:59,330
Can you imagine what a pain in the ass that would be?

3572
02:38:59,510 --> 02:38:59,850
Yes.

3573
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:01,570
The bucket is the perfect solution.

3574
02:39:01,570 --> 02:39:02,230
Give me the bucket.

3575
02:39:02,810 --> 02:39:03,490
Come on.

3576
02:39:03,650 --> 02:39:04,650
Give it a try.

3577
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:05,210
Wait.

3578
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:06,010
Can I walk here?

3579
02:39:06,090 --> 02:39:06,310
Okay.

3580
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:07,530
Okay.

3581
02:39:08,870 --> 02:39:09,350
Okay.

3582
02:39:15,430 --> 02:39:16,050
Why are you laughing?

3583
02:39:16,050 --> 02:39:16,830
Can you feel it?

3584
02:39:17,290 --> 02:39:23,650
The glow of comfort, even in the face of crushing despair, must already be sweeping through your body.

3585
02:39:23,850 --> 02:39:25,150
This is my second cup.

3586
02:39:25,150 --> 02:39:29,030
And in fact, can I say that I do believe the bucket lends you an air of charisma as well?

3587
02:39:29,070 --> 02:39:29,310
It does.

3588
02:39:29,550 --> 02:39:30,250
I think so.

3589
02:39:30,350 --> 02:39:34,390
I think that just holding it has made you the slightest bit more attractive as a person.

3590
02:39:34,510 --> 02:39:35,370
Do you think I think so?

3591
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:38,210
The benefits of the bucket seem to go on and on, don't they?

3592
02:39:38,430 --> 02:39:38,670
Yeah.

3593
02:39:38,670 --> 02:39:42,990
All this and more await you in the Stanley Parable 2.

3594
02:39:43,150 --> 02:39:44,110
I think so, honestly.

3595
02:39:44,970 --> 02:39:46,510
I feel really...

3596
02:39:46,510 --> 02:39:49,670
Look, I come walking out and I feel like...

3597
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:51,750
No.

3598
02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:54,210
No.

3599
02:39:55,150 --> 02:39:55,630
Stop.

3600
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:57,430
Stop.

3601
02:39:59,090 --> 02:39:59,730
Stop it.

3602
02:39:59,770 --> 02:40:00,150
Oh, my God.

3603
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:02,150
Just... Oh, my God.

3604
02:40:02,190 --> 02:40:06,330
Does anyone give out awards for most enjoyable bucket in a video game?

3605
02:40:06,450 --> 02:40:06,970
I don't know.

3606
02:40:06,970 --> 02:40:09,350
That really should be an award if it isn't already.

3607
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:10,850
Oh, wait.

3608
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:13,990
It's like I can see this girl over here.

3609
02:40:14,090 --> 02:40:15,850
She's like been staring at me.

3610
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:21,230
She's like, I've been looking at you from ever since you walked into the room.

3611
02:40:21,470 --> 02:40:23,970
Your bucket is really alluring.

3612
02:40:24,050 --> 02:40:29,510
And I'll be like, yeah, my bucket is like, you know, it's pretty cool.

3613
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:33,110
It's, you know, I've been with this bucket for a long time.

3614
02:40:33,910 --> 02:40:36,630
Do you want to touch my bucket?

3615
02:40:36,630 --> 02:40:38,450
She's like, is it okay?

3616
02:40:39,070 --> 02:40:41,790
I mean, I don't want to be, I don't want to be too forward.

3617
02:40:41,910 --> 02:40:46,390
But, like, it would be my first time touching someone's bucket before.

3618
02:40:47,550 --> 02:40:48,610
And be like, it's okay.

3619
02:40:49,930 --> 02:40:52,050
I don't normally let people do this.

3620
02:40:52,070 --> 02:40:56,370
But, you know, you can even hold it if you want.

3621
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:57,170
She's like, wow.

3622
02:40:57,990 --> 02:41:02,330
And then she takes it and she's like, she's like cradling it like a baby.

3623
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:04,410
And she's just like, gosh.

3624
02:41:04,410 --> 02:41:06,890
This just feels really natural.

3625
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:15,330
Like, I just feel, I feel, I feel like I should have met you a long time ago.

3626
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:18,890
And I'm like, you know what?

3627
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:20,590
It doesn't matter.

3628
02:41:20,730 --> 02:41:22,510
We can make up for lost time.

3629
02:41:25,570 --> 02:41:26,530
Sweet Caroline.

3630
02:41:27,430 --> 02:41:28,810
Bah, bah, bah.

3631
02:41:31,010 --> 02:41:32,270
Oh, infinite hole.

3632
02:41:36,410 --> 02:41:37,630
Okay, I'm not going to lie.

3633
02:41:38,170 --> 02:41:44,130
I'm pretty sure this is where my game worked last time.

3634
02:41:46,670 --> 02:41:49,350
I think this is where my game froze before.

3635
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:51,490
In the infinite hole.

3636
02:41:51,730 --> 02:41:53,210
So, I'm a little scared of going in there.

3637
02:42:03,730 --> 02:42:04,170
You cannot fall.

3638
02:42:04,530 --> 02:42:07,690
You can fall until the end of time, if you like.

3639
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:10,410
A stunning leap forward for video games as a medium.

3640
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:29,420
Oh, it's so quiet.

3641
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,420
Thought I could see it from up there.

3642
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:33,220
Oh, I think I...

3643
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:35,900
Hey, how could I see...

3644
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:37,340
I thought I saw it from up here.

3645
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:39,860
How is that possible?

3646
02:42:41,960 --> 02:42:42,760
Am I crazy?

3647
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,660
I thought I saw it from here.

3648
02:42:46,660 --> 02:42:47,840
Weird.

3649
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:50,820
It calls.

3650
02:42:51,140 --> 02:42:51,460
Okay.

3651
02:42:53,020 --> 02:42:53,880
Okay, guys.

3652
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:00,560
Oh, the roof lowered.

3653
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:01,280
Oh, okay.

3654
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,140
Here we go!

3655
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:08,700
It's a quote from yesterday.

3656
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:09,540
What the fuck?

3657
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:10,220
Isn't it wonderful?

3658
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:13,820
One of my more ingenious concoctions, if I do say so.

3659
02:43:14,220 --> 02:43:19,860
Now then, since you've gotten to see the infinite hole, you can press the teleport button.

3660
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:21,520
To pop back up to the top.

3661
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:23,380
And we can continue onward.

3662
02:43:23,700 --> 02:43:25,600
Gee, to return to the surface.

3663
02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:27,040
But there's an end, right?

3664
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,600
Now, I don't mean to be a bummer.

3665
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:32,920
But I do recommend you use the teleport button to go back to the top.

3666
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,400
Teleport.

3667
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:37,360
Maybe do it on the sooner rather than later spectrum of things.

3668
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:43,190
What's that sound?

3669
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:44,150
It's like kind of crunchy.

3670
02:43:44,290 --> 02:43:44,790
Okay, Stanley.

3671
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:46,990
I don't know quite how to say this tactfully.

3672
02:43:47,110 --> 02:43:51,390
But it's possible that I slightly exaggerated the infinite nature of the hole.

3673
02:43:51,390 --> 02:43:51,810
Okay.

3674
02:43:52,130 --> 02:43:53,570
Is it a very, very deep hole?

3675
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:54,990
To be certain it is.

3676
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:55,630
Wow.

3677
02:43:55,770 --> 02:43:57,290
It's an extremely deep hole.

3678
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:58,350
Extremely deep.

3679
02:43:58,350 --> 02:44:01,170
I don't want anyone to say that it isn't an astonishingly deep hole.

3680
02:44:01,230 --> 02:44:01,690
It is.

3681
02:44:01,730 --> 02:44:02,890
Is it infinite?

3682
02:44:03,370 --> 02:44:06,650
Well, that sort of depends on your definition of infinity.

3683
02:44:06,970 --> 02:44:11,510
From one perspective, the infinite is merely philosophical in nature.

3684
02:44:11,650 --> 02:44:12,590
It's more of a...

3685
02:44:12,590 --> 02:44:12,890
Ow!

3686
02:44:13,970 --> 02:44:14,470
Okay.

3687
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:15,930
Well, good for you.

3688
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:17,510
You found the bottom of the hole.

3689
02:44:17,750 --> 02:44:19,290
You found me out, Stanley.

3690
02:44:19,530 --> 02:44:20,950
I'm a liar and a cheat.

3691
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:22,090
And you're so clever.

3692
02:44:22,370 --> 02:44:27,690
Look, I think the issue here is just that you're unusually fascinated by falling.

3693
02:44:28,010 --> 02:44:31,350
What normal person actually wants to fall infinitely?

3694
02:44:31,770 --> 02:44:35,170
I figured the hole was as deep as anyone would actually need.

3695
02:44:35,270 --> 02:44:36,610
Don't you put this on me.

3696
02:44:36,750 --> 02:44:38,030
Maybe you're the problem.

3697
02:44:38,030 --> 02:44:38,450
My lunch!

3698
02:44:40,330 --> 02:44:42,870
Look, things got a little heated there.

3699
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:44,390
I think we both said some things we didn't mean.

3700
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:44,730
That's me.

3701
02:44:45,130 --> 02:44:50,930
Why don't we just put all this behind us and agree to just call the hole most stupid?

3702
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:52,850
The whole thing?

3703
02:44:52,850 --> 02:44:58,870
If that works for you, then go ahead and press the teleport button to warp up to the top of the hole and we can move on.

3704
02:44:59,030 --> 02:45:00,910
I'll just be up here when you're ready.

3705
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:02,890
It's nothing else, right?

3706
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:05,550
That's it?

3707
02:45:06,370 --> 02:45:10,950
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try.

3708
02:45:11,130 --> 02:45:12,930
Just the two of us.

3709
02:45:13,410 --> 02:45:15,030
Just the two of us.

3710
02:45:15,470 --> 02:45:17,410
just the two of us.

3711
02:45:17,870 --> 02:45:20,510
Building castles in the sky...

3712
02:45:20,510 --> 02:45:20,930
It's just the two of us.

3713
02:45:20,930 --> 02:45:22,130
It's just the two of us.

3714
02:45:22,390 --> 02:45:23,710
You and I.

3715
02:45:36,570 --> 02:45:40,750
I love holes!

3716
02:45:40,750 --> 02:45:41,030
Holes!

3717
02:45:47,410 --> 02:45:53,170
Since your debut, you've quickly become tied for my favorite... oh, streamer.

3718
02:45:54,350 --> 02:45:55,330
Thank you!

3719
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:56,810
Looking forward to the concert in July.

3720
02:45:56,930 --> 02:45:57,450
Thank you so much!

3721
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:08,510
I got shorter!

3722
02:46:10,750 --> 02:46:16,330
If you decide you've had enough of the hole, you can hit the teleport button and come join me up above.

3723
02:46:17,490 --> 02:46:18,270
I've had enough.

3724
02:46:18,450 --> 02:46:19,770
I'm positively thrilled.

3725
02:46:19,970 --> 02:46:21,630
I tripped!

3726
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:22,610
How could I have guessed?

3727
02:46:22,810 --> 02:46:23,990
You're back in the hole.

3728
02:46:24,490 --> 02:46:26,430
If this starts to become a thing where...

3729
02:46:26,430 --> 02:46:32,110
I love the eclipse.

3730
02:46:32,370 --> 02:46:38,430
I'm starting to become extremely certain that the hole is not only not infinite, but that it's growing steadily less and less infinite.

3731
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:47,850
I suspect that I'm starting to hit the point where it's no longer feasible to call the hole infinitely deep, even by the lax overall standards for accountability and marketing.

3732
02:46:47,850 --> 02:46:48,770
Not even a little bit.

3733
02:46:48,850 --> 02:46:49,510
What's going on here?

3734
02:46:50,170 --> 02:46:54,290
Stanley, I have no explanation for the uncertain nature of the hole's length.

3735
02:46:54,590 --> 02:46:56,430
Here, let's try something.

3736
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:56,890
Okay.

3737
02:46:57,050 --> 02:47:00,250
Let's pop back up to the top and we'll see if it gets any shorter.

3738
02:47:00,450 --> 02:47:00,590
Okay.

3739
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:01,990
Well, there it is.

3740
02:47:02,050 --> 02:47:02,310
Oh!

3741
02:47:02,510 --> 02:47:03,790
The shame of my liars...

3742
02:47:03,790 --> 02:47:04,070
Oh!

3743
02:47:04,070 --> 02:47:05,790
How is this still appealing to you?

3744
02:47:05,950 --> 02:47:06,210
Sorry.

3745
02:47:06,210 --> 02:47:11,750
I know you're obsessed with holes, but at this depth, I just can't see this scratching the itch.

3746
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:14,330
Who am I to judge?

3747
02:47:14,690 --> 02:47:16,690
You just do whatever it is you're here to do.

3748
02:47:16,690 --> 02:47:19,390
It's just like, it feels like a wild instinct to jump into a hole.

3749
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:24,150
Uh-oh.

3750
02:47:24,730 --> 02:47:25,290
Uh-oh.

3751
02:47:25,310 --> 02:47:25,570
Oh!

3752
02:47:25,630 --> 02:47:28,150
Is the, um, teleport button not working?

3753
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:29,190
Oh, I thought it was my game!

3754
02:47:29,290 --> 02:47:30,150
It's not working!

3755
02:47:30,690 --> 02:47:30,970
Are you sure?

3756
02:47:30,970 --> 02:47:31,290
Yes!

3757
02:47:31,490 --> 02:47:31,830
Well, I mean...

3758
02:47:31,830 --> 02:47:32,810
I thought...

3759
02:47:32,810 --> 02:47:34,250
I really don't have an explanation.

3760
02:47:34,570 --> 02:47:35,110
It was working just a moment ago.

3761
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:35,670
Just climb out!

3762
02:47:36,210 --> 02:47:37,090
Try it again.

3763
02:47:39,650 --> 02:47:40,450
Still nothing?

3764
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:41,790
Well, I suppose...

3765
02:47:41,790 --> 02:47:42,330
I can't jump.

3766
02:47:42,850 --> 02:47:43,830
I can't do anything.

3767
02:47:43,930 --> 02:47:45,110
I suppose there is one thing I can do to fix this.

3768
02:47:45,350 --> 02:47:45,750
Okay.

3769
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:46,190
I'm out.

3770
02:47:46,490 --> 02:47:47,350
Goodbye, Stanley.

3771
02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:49,530
You couldn't bear to play with me in the hole.

3772
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:53,190
And now you'll get more time with it than you could ever have asked for.

3773
02:47:53,350 --> 02:47:54,890
It's a win for everyone.

3774
02:47:55,170 --> 02:47:56,530
You get to be with the hole.

3775
02:47:56,690 --> 02:47:59,130
I get to do literally anything else.

3776
02:48:00,070 --> 02:48:00,470
Uh...

3777
02:48:00,470 --> 02:48:01,270
Take care, Stanley.

3778
02:48:01,630 --> 02:48:04,730
I hope you and the hole have a wonderful rest of it.

3779
02:48:04,830 --> 02:48:05,050
Wait!

3780
02:48:05,790 --> 02:48:06,190
Oh!

3781
02:48:07,290 --> 02:48:07,810
Well, that's a good one.

3782
02:48:08,390 --> 02:48:08,910
GG.

3783
02:48:09,090 --> 02:48:09,390
GG.

3784
02:48:09,390 --> 02:48:09,730
GG.

3785
02:48:09,730 --> 02:48:09,830
Baby.

3786
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:10,370
Baby.

3787
02:48:10,370 --> 02:48:10,670
Baby.

3788
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:10,930
GG.

3789
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:11,510
GG.

3790
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:12,210
Baby.

3791
02:48:12,510 --> 02:48:12,750
Baby.

3792
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:15,310
Oh!

3793
02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:18,330
What's going on?

3794
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:20,370
Is someone coming?

3795
02:48:21,010 --> 02:48:22,050
Is someone...

3796
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:23,250
GG.

3797
02:48:23,310 --> 02:48:23,830
GG.

3798
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:24,190
GG.

3799
02:48:27,490 --> 02:48:28,910
It's not moving, is it?

3800
02:48:29,530 --> 02:48:31,410
Are my eyes tricking me?

3801
02:48:31,410 --> 02:48:33,330
It looked like it was growing down for a second.

3802
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:36,050
What's happening in my room?

3803
02:48:36,050 --> 02:48:36,170
What?

3804
02:49:05,670 --> 02:49:08,430
This hole... was made for me.

3805
02:49:10,870 --> 02:49:12,250
I changed my perspective.

3806
02:49:19,210 --> 02:49:20,250
The bucket!

3807
02:49:23,490 --> 02:49:24,010
Germa!

3808
02:49:31,790 --> 02:49:33,210
Wait, how do I get back to normal?

3809
02:49:33,210 --> 02:49:35,590
Oh, change your perception.

3810
02:49:36,850 --> 02:49:37,450
No,

3811
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:44,030
no, I like the...

3812
02:49:45,210 --> 02:49:46,330
Oh, this one is...

3813
02:49:46,330 --> 02:49:48,150
Oh god.

3814
02:49:53,070 --> 02:49:54,450
I like the first one.

3815
02:49:55,250 --> 02:49:56,210
What is this?

3816
02:50:21,300 --> 02:50:40,460
Using up the space of mind My head's stronger You're no longer Using up the space of mind My head's stronger You're no longer Oh, I love this one.

3817
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:45,180
Using up the space of mind Puppies!

3818
02:50:47,070 --> 02:50:58,760
My head's stronger You're no longer Using up the space of mind My head's stronger

3819
02:51:01,800 --> 02:51:08,080
Using up the space of mind My head's stronger Okay, please.

3820
02:51:08,860 --> 02:51:12,300
My head's stronger Hey!

3821
02:51:12,460 --> 02:51:13,100
Hey!

3822
02:51:13,260 --> 02:51:13,460
Hey!

3823
02:51:13,460 --> 02:51:13,480
Hey!

3824
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:13,960
Hey!

3825
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:18,080
Change your reality My eye!

3826
02:51:26,610 --> 02:51:28,730
What is going on?

3827
02:51:28,730 --> 02:51:29,970
What is going on?

3828
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:30,930
Oh my god, where's anime?

3829
02:51:33,030 --> 02:51:33,810
Yes!

3830
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:35,850
No!

3831
02:51:39,700 --> 02:51:41,570
I was waiting for anime Stanley!

3832
02:51:45,870 --> 02:51:46,650
Why?

3833
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:05,910
I was waiting for anime Stanley!

3834
02:52:07,710 --> 02:52:08,430
Can I get out?

3835
02:52:09,430 --> 02:52:10,150
Toodle pip!

3836
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:17,560
Starting again.

3837
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:19,560
No, we're going back!

3838
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:30,380
That's like my favorite voice effect ever.

3839
02:52:30,580 --> 02:52:31,960
Oh my god, my game didn't break!

3840
02:52:32,300 --> 02:52:33,040
Let's go!

3841
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:33,380
Oh!

3842
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:36,140
Oh my gosh.

3843
02:52:36,520 --> 02:52:37,960
Oh, it's a new construction.

3844
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:41,820
Wait.

3845
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:44,540
But I already have a bucket.

3846
02:52:44,620 --> 02:52:45,380
Can I get a second one?

3847
02:52:50,150 --> 02:52:50,830
Toodle pip.

3848
02:53:02,110 --> 02:53:02,990
I think...

3849
02:53:03,670 --> 02:53:05,090
I think that's everything though.

3850
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:06,650
Button that says gym.

3851
02:53:07,890 --> 02:53:10,230
Let me go check the map just in...

3852
02:53:10,230 --> 02:53:11,010
Oh, that's new!

3853
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:12,490
That door up there!

3854
02:53:12,690 --> 02:53:13,490
Can I get to there?

3855
02:53:13,630 --> 02:53:14,430
The new door?

3856
02:53:14,730 --> 02:53:15,830
That says it's new?

3857
02:53:17,150 --> 02:53:18,410
I don't think so.

3858
02:53:18,510 --> 02:53:19,530
Let's check out the map.

3859
02:53:19,750 --> 02:53:20,570
Make sure I've done everything.

3860
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:21,790
Button that says the name.

3861
02:53:22,550 --> 02:53:22,990
Merch.

3862
02:53:23,470 --> 02:53:25,090
Settings world champion.

3863
02:53:29,630 --> 02:53:30,450
Reassurance bucket.

3864
02:53:32,810 --> 02:53:33,690
Office decorations.

3865
02:53:34,350 --> 02:53:35,090
Oh yeah, we went in there.

3866
02:53:35,410 --> 02:53:35,850
Epilogue.

3867
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:38,970
Collectibles.

3868
02:53:39,650 --> 02:53:40,490
Yeah, we went in there.

3869
02:53:40,530 --> 02:53:40,850
Epilogue.

3870
02:53:42,870 --> 02:53:43,590
What is that?

3871
02:53:43,630 --> 02:53:44,030
Where is that?

3872
02:53:45,730 --> 02:53:46,530
By five.

3873
02:53:46,990 --> 02:53:49,050
Oh, I think it's what I'm looking at up here.

3874
02:53:55,470 --> 02:53:57,130
Should I use up the rest of my jumps?

3875
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:08,280
The settings world champion.

3876
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:09,240
I can still do it.

3877
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:10,220
Where was it though?

3878
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:11,520
Over here?

3879
02:54:12,420 --> 02:54:13,940
Oh wait, here's a staircase.

3880
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:14,060
Staircase.

3881
02:54:19,320 --> 02:54:20,760
Settings world champion.

3882
02:54:21,720 --> 02:54:22,320
Over here?

3883
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:28,620
Oh.

3884
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:30,060
Never mind.

3885
02:54:31,700 --> 02:54:32,540
Never mind.

3886
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:35,720
Mostly infinite hole.

3887
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:36,860
Free achievement.

3888
02:54:38,620 --> 02:54:39,080
Epilogue.

3889
02:54:48,310 --> 02:54:49,370
Merch QR code.

3890
02:54:50,090 --> 02:54:52,190
I told you I don't have my phone, you guys!

3891
02:54:53,230 --> 02:54:54,710
I don't know where my phone is.

3892
02:54:54,750 --> 02:54:56,310
I would have to leave and go find it.

3893
02:54:56,350 --> 02:54:57,190
But I don't know where it is.

3894
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:05,820
You'll have to get the achievement to get it.

3895
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:07,360
Gotta change every setting in the menu.

3896
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:10,140
Wait, what do you mean?

3897
02:55:30,260 --> 02:55:30,700
This?

3898
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:31,360
Oh.

3899
02:55:34,680 --> 02:55:36,960
Oh, I think I've probably messed with everything in here.

3900
02:55:41,270 --> 02:55:41,910
Oh wait.

3901
02:55:56,470 --> 02:55:56,910
Eee.

3902
02:56:05,870 --> 02:56:07,690
Slide the sliders all the way.

3903
02:56:07,910 --> 02:56:08,350
Eee.

3904
02:56:08,350 --> 02:56:08,470
Slide the sliders all the way.

3905
02:56:20,080 --> 02:56:20,440
Oh.

3906
02:56:24,250 --> 02:56:25,490
This is so...

3907
02:56:25,870 --> 02:56:28,290
God, this is really satisfying to hear though, isn't it?

3908
02:56:30,510 --> 02:56:30,870
God, this is really satisfying to hear though, isn't it?

3909
02:56:30,870 --> 02:56:31,350
Oh, this one too.

3910
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:32,170
Oh.

3911
02:56:33,450 --> 02:56:33,810
Japanese!

3912
02:56:36,670 --> 02:56:39,110
It's just like the most satisfying thing I've ever...

3913
02:56:58,740 --> 02:57:00,160
I could listen to this forever.

3914
02:57:00,360 --> 02:57:01,520
Sorry, I know I'm not talking.

3915
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:02,820
It's because it just sounds so good.

3916
02:57:11,950 --> 02:57:13,230
I don't think I changed anything.

3917
02:57:13,370 --> 02:57:13,630
So yeah.

3918
02:57:16,010 --> 02:57:16,810
Delete the save data.

3919
02:57:19,850 --> 02:57:21,830
Do I have to do all the resolutions and everything?

3920
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:26,090
Oh, this just sounds so good.

3921
02:57:34,590 --> 02:57:35,330
It's just...

3922
02:57:35,330 --> 02:57:38,930
It just really hits in a good way.

3923
02:57:39,050 --> 02:57:39,410
Hold on.

3924
02:57:39,790 --> 02:57:40,570
Turn it up some.

3925
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:18,380
FLV to 100?

3926
02:58:18,700 --> 02:58:19,560
I did that, didn't I?

3927
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:20,260
Oh.

3928
02:58:20,900 --> 02:58:21,680
Oh, thank you.

3929
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:23,580
There we go.

3930
02:58:29,470 --> 02:58:29,890
God.

3931
02:58:31,790 --> 02:58:33,010
Hey, let me in.

3932
02:58:33,010 --> 02:58:33,650
I'm the setting...

3933
02:58:33,650 --> 02:58:33,950
Oh, wait.

3934
02:58:36,910 --> 02:58:37,810
Of the...

3935
02:58:37,810 --> 02:58:39,470
Of the settings world...

3936
02:58:39,470 --> 02:58:39,530
Aha!

3937
02:58:39,770 --> 02:58:43,530
I can see you've gotten the settings world champion achievement.

3938
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:44,590
Well done.

3939
02:58:44,970 --> 02:58:47,350
You've experienced every setting.

3940
02:58:47,570 --> 02:58:50,250
Traveled to all corners of the settings menu.

3941
02:58:50,430 --> 02:58:52,410
There's nothing you haven't seen.

3942
02:58:52,990 --> 02:58:58,650
So, just for you, in the Stanley Parable 2, I'm including an entirely new setting.

3943
02:58:58,790 --> 02:59:01,130
Something called Bumpscocity.

3944
02:59:01,770 --> 02:59:02,210
Bumpscocity.

3945
02:59:02,210 --> 02:59:04,110
What exactly is Bumpscocity?

3946
02:59:04,290 --> 02:59:04,650
Yeah.

3947
02:59:04,770 --> 02:59:10,170
Well, I haven't quite figured that part out yet, but I just know that you'll be able to adjust it... Well, the subtitles are gone.

3948
02:59:10,170 --> 02:59:11,670
...on some sort of slider.

3949
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:13,170
And... Sorry.

3950
02:59:14,470 --> 02:59:14,990
But...

3951
02:59:18,950 --> 02:59:21,750
...that it'll be available from the settings menu.

3952
02:59:21,790 --> 02:59:22,070
There you go.

3953
02:59:22,150 --> 02:59:22,230
Sorry.

3954
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:22,230
Bye-bye.

3955
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:24,330
We'll sort the rest of the details out later.

3956
02:59:24,550 --> 02:59:31,030
I hope you're looking forward to trying out every level of Bumpscocity in the Stanley Parable 2.

3957
02:59:31,050 --> 02:59:31,570
Bumpscocity.

3958
02:59:33,170 --> 02:59:33,690
Bumpscocity.

3959
02:59:37,450 --> 02:59:37,850
Bumpscocity.

3960
02:59:41,250 --> 02:59:44,110
I'm the champion of setting all the sliders to all the possible numbers.

3961
02:59:45,030 --> 02:59:46,090
Please enjoy this room.

3962
02:59:46,210 --> 02:59:47,110
This is your room.

3963
02:59:47,190 --> 02:59:48,210
It was made just for you.

3964
02:59:49,090 --> 02:59:49,870
Thank you!

3965
02:59:51,650 --> 02:59:52,050
Okay.

3966
02:59:52,310 --> 02:59:53,490
Now I think we can leave.

3967
02:59:57,410 --> 02:59:58,530
Let's get out of here.

3968
03:00:00,010 --> 03:00:00,810
Bump those...

3969
03:00:00,810 --> 03:00:01,190
Oh, wait.

3970
03:00:01,230 --> 03:00:02,950
Do I actually have a new setting?

3971
03:00:05,050 --> 03:00:05,450
Bumpscocity?

3972
03:00:08,750 --> 03:00:09,350
Bumpscocity?

3973
03:00:09,350 --> 03:00:10,510
Oh, I'm back in here.

3974
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:11,090
Oh!

3975
03:00:11,910 --> 03:00:12,510
Bumpscocity!

3976
03:00:13,390 --> 03:00:14,410
A thousand.

3977
03:00:17,510 --> 03:00:18,530
What did it do?

3978
03:00:22,430 --> 03:00:23,030
Bump...

3979
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:23,710
I haven't...

3980
03:00:30,050 --> 03:00:31,310
It didn't do anything!

3981
03:00:39,450 --> 03:00:41,090
Adjust the Bumpscocity.

3982
03:00:43,510 --> 03:00:45,750
It's probably so big that it like...

3983
03:00:46,370 --> 03:00:47,370
...that it like...

3984
03:00:47,710 --> 03:00:48,050
looped around.

3985
03:00:48,290 --> 03:00:48,870
You know what I'm saying?

3986
03:00:49,810 --> 03:00:50,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

3987
03:00:51,010 --> 03:00:51,630
Oh my god!

3988
03:00:51,670 --> 03:00:51,930
Whoa, whoa!

3989
03:00:51,990 --> 03:00:52,670
I'm feeling it!

3990
03:00:52,770 --> 03:00:53,310
I'm feeling it!

3991
03:00:53,530 --> 03:00:53,890
Oh!

3992
03:00:54,090 --> 03:00:54,750
Oh my god!

3993
03:00:54,930 --> 03:00:55,490
Whoa, whoa!

3994
03:00:55,510 --> 03:00:56,130
Hold on, I have to...

3995
03:00:56,930 --> 03:00:58,550
Okay, I know this is like a new feature.

3996
03:00:59,970 --> 03:01:01,710
So it's probably like, you know...

3997
03:01:01,710 --> 03:01:03,750
not exactly like...

3998
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:05,830
Okay, that's so much more manageable.

3999
03:01:07,750 --> 03:01:08,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

4000
03:01:09,050 --> 03:01:09,630
Try bump...

4001
03:01:09,630 --> 03:01:10,110
Whoa!

4002
03:01:11,590 --> 03:01:11,950
Whoa!

4003
03:01:14,210 --> 03:01:14,570
Bumpscocity!

4004
03:01:17,270 --> 03:01:17,630
Bumpscocity!

4005
03:01:17,630 --> 03:01:19,890
I had to really... yeah, it was like a really...

4006
03:01:19,890 --> 03:01:20,750
really intense.

4007
03:01:21,150 --> 03:01:23,590
I shouldn't have... I should have just worked...

4008
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:25,610
I think this is a type of setting that like...

4009
03:01:25,610 --> 03:01:27,490
not everyone can handle.

4010
03:01:27,530 --> 03:01:28,990
Like, I can handle it because...

4011
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:31,250
you know, I'm like... better than you.

4012
03:01:31,410 --> 03:01:33,370
But I don't think anybody else...

4013
03:01:33,370 --> 03:01:37,910
It's like... it takes a really, really, really like... high IQ...

4014
03:01:37,910 --> 03:01:44,530
like really, really like specific type of like awesome person to be able to handle it.

4015
03:01:44,550 --> 03:01:45,050
You know what I'm saying?

4016
03:01:45,130 --> 03:01:45,650
So like...

4017
03:01:45,650 --> 03:01:50,730
If you're playing this and you get any... I don't think... I don't expect you guys to get the bumpscocity...

4018
03:01:50,730 --> 03:01:57,790
you know... like a slider because it's like pretty... it's like only real gamers can get it.

4019
03:01:57,850 --> 03:02:00,590
And so I don't really know if you guys are capable of doing that.

4020
03:02:00,650 --> 03:02:07,030
But if you do, if you just happen to get lucky and like maybe like accidentally stumble upon it...

4021
03:02:07,530 --> 03:02:08,290
you know...

4022
03:02:08,930 --> 03:02:15,670
I would recommend maybe you start at like a 1 and then just kind of like work your way up.

4023
03:02:15,710 --> 03:02:22,410
Because for me, I can go from like a thousand and like it's a little hard to adjust but like I'm fine.

4024
03:02:22,770 --> 03:02:27,490
For you, I think you might actually be crushed into like into like little tiny...

4025
03:02:27,490 --> 03:02:30,870
your little tiny brain would be like you know what I mean?

4026
03:02:31,030 --> 03:02:31,510
So...

4027
03:02:31,510 --> 03:02:33,130
just don't... don't worry about it.

4028
03:02:33,270 --> 03:02:35,050
Mint is better than me confirmed.

4029
03:02:35,370 --> 03:02:35,970
No!

4030
03:02:38,570 --> 03:02:39,230
Epilogue.

4031
03:02:40,850 --> 03:02:41,510
Oh!

4032
03:02:42,530 --> 03:02:43,190
Oh!

4033
03:02:44,050 --> 03:02:46,770
An epilogue would be fun, wouldn't it, Stanley?

4034
03:02:47,050 --> 03:02:47,450
Yes.

4035
03:02:47,710 --> 03:02:48,030
Yes.

4036
03:02:48,110 --> 03:02:49,030
It would go at the end of the...

4037
03:02:49,030 --> 03:02:50,150
Why are you guys clowning me?

4038
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:51,330
We'll figure that out later.

4039
03:02:55,160 --> 03:02:55,620
That's it?

4040
03:02:55,780 --> 03:02:57,200
That's all the epilogue was for?

4041
03:02:59,560 --> 03:03:00,600
Taste the sequel.

4042
03:03:01,740 --> 03:03:02,480
That was it?

4043
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:05,480
Two!

4044
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:06,900
I like that guy.

4045
03:03:11,950 --> 03:03:12,350
Okay.

4046
03:03:16,550 --> 03:03:17,350
Okie dokie.

4047
03:03:17,410 --> 03:03:18,170
I think that's the exit.

4048
03:03:19,450 --> 03:03:20,150
Guys, I'm fine.

4049
03:03:20,530 --> 03:03:21,150
It ended.

4050
03:03:21,850 --> 03:03:24,690
Do you guys mind if I actually go to the bathroom real quick?

4051
03:03:24,910 --> 03:03:26,810
Gotta go to the little ghost's room.

4052
03:03:27,690 --> 03:03:28,570
Real fast.

4053
03:03:30,090 --> 03:03:32,290
I had tea and bubble tea.

4054
03:03:37,510 --> 03:03:40,270
Should I finish up all my jumps too?

4055
03:03:40,470 --> 03:03:40,850
I wonder.

4056
03:03:41,410 --> 03:03:42,010
Oh wait.

4057
03:03:42,110 --> 03:03:43,030
Oh, this is how I get out.

4058
03:03:53,190 --> 03:03:54,470
Grab your phone too.

4059
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:57,450
Okay, I'll go look for it if I don't find it really fast.

4060
03:03:57,910 --> 03:03:59,330
Then I'm gonna give up.

4061
03:03:59,430 --> 03:03:59,610
Okay?

4062
03:03:59,710 --> 03:04:02,290
Because I lose my phone all the time.

4063
03:04:02,350 --> 03:04:03,290
I don't think you guys realize.

4064
03:04:04,310 --> 03:04:04,750
Okay.

4065
03:04:04,830 --> 03:04:06,410
I'll be right back.

4066
03:04:06,550 --> 03:04:11,250
Let me make a little note that says she's gone to the bathroom.

4067
03:04:13,290 --> 03:04:16,010
Gone to the bathroom.

4068
03:04:16,650 --> 03:04:17,670
Okay, I'll be right back.

4069
03:06:25,900 --> 03:06:26,540
I'm back.

4070
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:26,980
Sorry.

4071
03:06:28,220 --> 03:06:29,240
Sorry it took so long.

4072
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:30,560
Oh.

4073
03:06:30,560 --> 03:06:31,880
Oh my god.

4074
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:34,880
I had to strip off my phone.

4075
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:36,120
I found my phone.

4076
03:06:38,540 --> 03:06:39,660
I found my phone.

4077
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:40,160
I found my phone.

4078
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:41,180
Okay.

4079
03:06:41,780 --> 03:06:42,260
Alright.

4080
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:46,480
I guess since so many people asked, I'll go do the QR code.

4081
03:06:46,740 --> 03:06:47,940
I'll go do the QR code.

4082
03:06:52,590 --> 03:06:55,550
People are so passionate about QR codes, I guess.

4083
03:06:55,750 --> 03:06:56,490
Oh, and my jumps.

4084
03:06:56,490 --> 03:06:57,270
Let's finish my jumps.

4085
03:07:06,200 --> 03:07:06,560
Welcome home!

4086
03:07:15,730 --> 03:07:17,090
Welcome home.

4087
03:07:19,790 --> 03:07:20,890
Capture wording, huh?

4088
03:07:26,930 --> 03:07:27,610
Emily!

4089
03:07:29,730 --> 03:07:30,410
Hello.

4090
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:32,110
Randall, thanks for the five gifted.

4091
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:35,450
Okay, let me scan this with my phone.

4092
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:38,270
Oh my god.

4093
03:07:41,330 --> 03:07:46,870
StanleyParable2.com StanleyParable2.com Welcome to the official site of The Stanley Parable 2.

4094
03:07:46,990 --> 03:07:47,570
A sequel, huh?

4095
03:07:49,150 --> 03:07:50,850
Oh, this is direct YouTube link.

4096
03:07:51,110 --> 03:07:52,430
Should I play this on stream?

4097
03:07:57,870 --> 03:07:58,470
Hold on.

4098
03:07:58,590 --> 03:07:59,710
Should I play this on stream?

4099
03:08:04,770 --> 03:08:05,450
Okay, hold on.

4100
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:07,650
Oh, it's unlisted even.

4101
03:08:07,870 --> 03:08:08,290
Wow.

4102
03:08:08,470 --> 03:08:09,310
Okay, one second.

4103
03:08:09,690 --> 03:08:10,730
Let me pull it up.

4104
03:08:11,590 --> 03:08:12,710
Let me pull it up.

4105
03:08:12,750 --> 03:08:13,290
Let me...

4106
03:08:14,410 --> 03:08:15,250
New table.

4107
03:08:17,090 --> 03:08:17,930
New window.

4108
03:08:18,910 --> 03:08:19,330
YouTube.

4109
03:08:22,850 --> 03:08:23,250
YouTube.

4110
03:08:26,130 --> 03:08:26,530
YouTube.

4111
03:08:27,550 --> 03:08:27,950
YouTube.

4112
03:08:28,990 --> 03:08:29,390
YouTube.

4113
03:08:32,330 --> 03:08:33,130
Oh, no.

4114
03:08:33,290 --> 03:08:34,230
It didn't show up in my history.

4115
03:08:34,330 --> 03:08:34,690
Why not?

4116
03:08:37,750 --> 03:08:38,550
Oh, because...

4117
03:08:38,550 --> 03:08:39,030
Oh, shoot.

4118
03:08:40,230 --> 03:08:41,990
How do I open it in the app?

4119
03:08:42,690 --> 03:08:43,090
Wait.

4120
03:08:43,170 --> 03:08:43,990
Open in the app.

4121
03:08:44,090 --> 03:08:44,490
There we go.

4122
03:08:46,010 --> 03:08:46,410
Okay.

4123
03:08:46,470 --> 03:08:46,670
Okay.

4124
03:08:46,710 --> 03:08:46,890
Okay.

4125
03:08:46,910 --> 03:08:48,330
Now I should show up in my history.

4126
03:08:49,430 --> 03:08:49,830
Okay.

4127
03:08:49,890 --> 03:08:50,330
There we go.

4128
03:08:50,390 --> 03:08:50,390
There we go.

4129
03:08:51,330 --> 03:08:52,530
Oh no, no, no...

4130
03:08:53,330 --> 03:08:55,090
One second, one second, one second...

4131
03:08:55,090 --> 03:08:57,390
One second, one second, one second, one second...

4132
03:08:59,130 --> 03:08:59,530
Uuuh...

4133
03:09:00,350 --> 03:09:01,150

4134
03:09:06,810 --> 03:09:12,250

4137
03:09:20,150 --> 03:09:20,350
Okay.

4138
03:09:20,770 --> 03:09:21,910
Ta-da!

4139
03:09:23,370 --> 03:09:24,530
Okie-dokie.

4140
03:09:24,550 --> 03:09:24,810
Alright.

4141
03:09:25,010 --> 03:09:25,690
Watch along!

4142
03:09:33,360 --> 03:09:34,160
Timmy!

4143
03:09:37,680 --> 03:09:38,480
Wow.

4144
03:09:38,660 --> 03:09:39,940
Breakfast of Champions.

4145
03:09:43,560 --> 03:09:44,360
Lunch!

4146
03:09:54,300 --> 03:09:54,900
Wow.

4147
03:09:57,280 --> 03:09:59,040
Why isn't Timmy responding?

4148
03:10:08,860 --> 03:10:10,060
So true.

4149
03:10:13,520 --> 03:10:13,660
Oh.

4150
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:19,040
I don't want to look like that!

4151
03:10:20,820 --> 03:10:22,540
I need to stop thinking right now.

4152
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:24,380
Good thing I never thought.

4153
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:34,240
Automobile.

4154
03:10:36,320 --> 03:10:36,880
Wow.

4155
03:10:38,200 --> 03:10:39,500
How long is this?

4156
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:40,220
No!

4157
03:10:40,300 --> 03:10:40,520
Wait!

4158
03:10:40,540 --> 03:10:41,740
This is 10 minutes, you guys!

4159
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:43,500
Wait!

4160
03:10:43,500 --> 03:10:44,980
This is so long!

4161
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:50,220
This is 10 minutes!

4162
03:10:53,560 --> 03:10:54,420
Hahah.

4163
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:11,080
Times two, Spree.

4164
03:11:11,100 --> 03:11:14,340
Five shirts?!

4165
03:11:14,340 --> 03:11:14,680
Wow!

4166
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:15,160
Wow!

4167
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:21,680
Get with the times, Becky.

4168
03:11:26,300 --> 03:11:26,780
What?

4169
03:11:32,540 --> 03:11:32,800
What?

4170
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:38,520
You know what?

4171
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:39,560
I'll be honest.

4172
03:11:41,500 --> 03:11:42,200
I'll be honest.

4173
03:11:42,360 --> 03:11:44,340
I don't know if it's actually getting a sequel.

4174
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:47,760
Is it actually...

4175
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:50,080
Is it actually getting a sequel?

4176
03:11:50,340 --> 03:11:50,820
Because...

4177
03:11:50,820 --> 03:11:52,500
I can't tell anymore.

4178
03:11:57,480 --> 03:12:00,440
It doesn't have enough of the transatlantic accent.

4179
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:01,020
You know what I mean?

4180
03:12:01,940 --> 03:12:03,200
To match the...

4181
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:05,240
The vibes of this.

4182
03:12:05,740 --> 03:12:06,680
Oh, it isn't.

4183
03:12:06,680 --> 03:12:06,980
Okay.

4184
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:10,980
This is the sequel.

4185
03:12:11,060 --> 03:12:11,440
You're right.

4186
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:11,680
You're right.

4187
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:11,800
You're right.

4188
03:12:12,640 --> 03:12:14,060
Yeah, Timmy.

4189
03:12:14,680 --> 03:12:17,720
This is why the Stanley Parable 2 will be perfect for you.

4190
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:20,360
It's as manly as video games can get.

4191
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:26,340
And if you don't believe me, let's look at the burly hunk of a man who's responsible for the game.

4192
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:29,020
Here he is, hard at work.

4193
03:12:29,140 --> 03:12:29,420
Really?

4194
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:31,380
His name is Gregory Apec.

4195
03:12:31,580 --> 03:12:34,340
And he's the cutting picture of royal masculinity.

4196
03:12:35,420 --> 03:12:37,960
Gregory is what we call the ideas guy.

4197
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:41,020
And he has the most important role on the team.

4198
03:12:41,420 --> 03:12:44,660
The ideas guy tirelessly comes up with interesting ideas.

4199
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:51,400
And then hands them off to the rest of the developers for the relatively simple job of turning those concepts into reality.

4200
03:12:51,400 --> 03:12:52,200
I'm an ideas guy.

4201
03:12:52,980 --> 03:12:55,200
I don't know how to do anything.

4202
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:59,080
He's the one who picked up the phone and declared, Someone ought to make a sequel to the Stanley Parable.

4203
03:12:59,420 --> 03:13:00,480
Good work, Gregory.

4204
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:03,320
Go ahead and take the rest of the day off.

4205
03:13:03,660 --> 03:13:07,320
With the hard part out of the way, work on the game can now begin.

4206
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:09,000
Stanley Parable 2 is coming out soon.

4207
03:13:09,240 --> 03:13:11,300
Just a month after Minecraft 2.

4208
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:13,200
What makes a sequel in the first place?

4209
03:13:13,200 --> 03:13:14,060
Well, it's simple.

4210
03:13:14,420 --> 03:13:18,360
Sequels are an opportunity to correct the mistakes of their predecessors.

4211
03:13:18,700 --> 03:13:20,260
We've all made mistakes.

4212
03:13:20,460 --> 03:13:25,320
And we've all caused harm to someone we love in order to cover up our mistakes.

4213
03:13:25,720 --> 03:13:33,360
When developing this particular sequel, it's important to start by thinking, What mistakes did the original Stanley Parable make?

4214
03:13:33,660 --> 03:13:38,800
Well, first off, most of the pornography in the original game was stolen or pirated.

4215
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:42,200
And it's time we paid the licensing fees fair and square.

4216
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:57,220
Second, the Stanley Parable was catastrophic for this man named Leroy, whose personal information including home address, social security number, and bank information were all displayed prominently in multiple locations throughout the game.

4217
03:13:57,500 --> 03:14:09,740
Although Leroy's money and identity were stolen, the fact remains that his personal information was the emotional core of the game and absolutely vital to a nuanced understanding of the story.

4218
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:20,200
As reparation for the harm we caused him, the sequel will contain a brief and insincere apology to Leroy dug deep within the game where it will be difficult to find.

4219
03:14:20,980 --> 03:14:27,040
Finally, the Stanley Parable made the mistake of leaking too many government secrets about the nature of the Time Wars.

4220
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:28,440
The Time Wars?

4221
03:14:28,820 --> 03:14:33,520
Without these intricate details of specific military tactics, the story is likely to make very little sense.

4222
03:14:33,760 --> 03:14:34,860
There's war in this game?

4223
03:14:34,860 --> 03:14:38,500
But we decided to remove them from the sequel in the interest of helping the state's efforts.

4224
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:40,840
We'll get to you yet, Time Dracula.

4225
03:14:41,280 --> 03:14:41,840
Dracula?

4226
03:14:43,200 --> 03:14:45,680
We're going to set about constructing the Stanley Parable 2.

4227
03:14:46,040 --> 03:14:56,100
Game development is a difficult and complex art, one which can only be fully understood by this race of hyper-intelligent child soldiers The children soldiers!

4228
03:14:57,020 --> 03:14:57,680
Yippee!

4229
03:14:57,680 --> 03:14:59,680
They begin by studying the original Stanley Parable.

4230
03:14:59,860 --> 03:15:02,040
Here it is in its raw, untouched form.

4231
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:04,360
They're eating gunpowder!

4232
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:05,060
A specimen of technological perfection.

4233
03:15:05,480 --> 03:15:07,600
Time to exploit it for profit.

4234
03:15:07,800 --> 03:15:08,440
Let's go!

4235
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:09,440
We begin by adding jokes.

4236
03:15:09,740 --> 03:15:16,240
The Stanley Parable was most widely known for its stark lack, lack of humor, bucking all conventional industry wisdom.

4237
03:15:16,420 --> 03:15:20,960
It was a bold artist's statement that its developers stood firmly behind.

4238
03:15:21,380 --> 03:15:28,400
But in 2022, it's impossible to reach even a single consumer of video games without jokes of some kind.

4239
03:15:28,700 --> 03:15:31,220
So very well, jokes it'll be.

4240
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:31,500
Woo!

4241
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:32,520
We're getting jokes!

4242
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:34,000
Uh-oh, my YouTube broke.

4243
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:34,700
Hold on, you guys.

4244
03:15:35,300 --> 03:15:36,140
Oh gosh.

4245
03:15:36,420 --> 03:15:39,220
I can't re-chat.

4246
03:15:39,300 --> 03:15:39,520
I'm sorry.

4247
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:52,200
Creating jobs for hundreds of machine operators, and producing 30,000 tons of pollutant chemical byproduct, which will be pumped directly into local lakes, rivers, and beautiful nature reserves like these all over the country.

4248
03:15:52,220 --> 03:15:53,660
Ah, screw the environment!

4249
03:15:54,100 --> 03:15:57,080
Another common complaint of the Stanley Parable is that there wasn't enough gameplay.

4250
03:15:57,460 --> 03:16:02,180
And so for the sequel, its developers have gone to great lengths to fix this problem.

4251
03:16:02,480 --> 03:16:05,180
Here we can see gameplay being printed onto sheets.

4252
03:16:05,420 --> 03:16:09,480
Every video game contains as many as a thousand sheets of gameplay.

4253
03:16:09,900 --> 03:16:11,080
That's a lot of gameplay.

4254
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:14,060
The largest games ever made contain close to 1,500.

4255
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:18,020
On mobile devices, the gameplay sheets have to be printed smaller.

4256
03:16:18,400 --> 03:16:29,660
For the Stanley Parable 2, as many as 35 new gameplay sheets are being printed, each of which must be delicately massaged by the hands of a child before being added into the game.

4257
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:38,420
This man is stealing gameplay sheets from the factory, which he likely intends to use for a personal project he's been developing in his spare time.

4258
03:16:38,860 --> 03:16:39,680
Kill him!

4259
03:16:39,880 --> 03:16:40,260
Kill him!

4260
03:16:42,300 --> 03:16:42,860
Stoning?

4261
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:44,780
Let's check on Gregory real quick.

4262
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:45,420
Ha!

4263
03:16:45,620 --> 03:16:47,940
Still recovering from a hard day's work.

4264
03:16:48,140 --> 03:16:49,380
Don't you move a muscle.

4265
03:16:49,940 --> 03:16:51,180
Good job, Gregory.

4266
03:16:51,480 --> 03:16:52,960
It's time to blackmail the press.

4267
03:16:53,280 --> 03:17:01,560
In a competitive market, blackmailing your local journalist can be one of the most effective methods of creating word-of-mouth buzz for your sequel.

4268
03:17:01,860 --> 03:17:05,280
In fact, blackmail is the currency of social progress.

4269
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:13,360
From your neighborhood grocer, to the teacher at your school, to the man who helps you steal, HBO, everyone responds to blackmail.

4270
03:17:13,560 --> 03:17:18,580
And if you've never done it before, it's easy to practice at home on your friends and family.

4271
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:23,740
Simply follow the instructional pamphlet that your teacher hands out after the end of the show.

4272
03:17:24,180 --> 03:17:33,960
And finally, there's one last tool at our disposal for making the sequel feel fresh and exciting, and that's packaging the game with collector's edition merchandise.

4273
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:45,440
If you order The Stanley Parable 2, you'll receive this cow's egg, a single egg will produce over a thousand cows, which are, of course, the sequel to Pigs.

4274
03:17:45,640 --> 03:17:46,940
And there you have it.

4275
03:17:47,060 --> 03:17:50,640
Everything there is to know about producing The Stanley Parable 2.

4276
03:17:50,980 --> 03:17:57,140
Of course, you may know that there is also a game titled The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe.

4277
03:17:57,260 --> 03:18:00,740
So which game is the true sequel to The Stanley Parable?

4278
03:18:00,740 --> 03:18:01,460
Gregory looks so confused.

4279
03:18:02,200 --> 03:18:03,460
Oh, sorry, Billy.

4280
03:18:03,680 --> 03:18:07,780
One which the child soldiers have been working round the clock to come up with an answer to.

4281
03:18:07,900 --> 03:18:08,260
Come on!

4282
03:18:08,260 --> 03:18:09,560
Feed them more gum powder!

4283
03:18:09,780 --> 03:18:13,960
And after many weeks of diligent research, the conclusion they've reached is, who gives a shit?

4284
03:18:14,200 --> 03:18:19,380
All that matters is that it's more content for you to cram down your insatiable gullet.

4285
03:18:19,480 --> 03:18:21,400
You don't want thoughtful and nuanced answers to complex questions, Billy.

4286
03:18:21,400 --> 03:18:22,500
I'm eating all this content.

4287
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:23,760
I'm eating all this content.

4288
03:18:24,200 --> 03:18:26,820
You just want to eat bubble gum and cheated hopscotch.

4289
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:29,140
How do you cheat at hopscotch?

4290
03:18:29,320 --> 03:18:37,060
Do your civic duty and bully your parents into buying you every version of The Stanley Parable 2 on every platform.

4291
03:18:37,060 --> 03:18:38,440
I already do that with Metal Gear Solid.

4292
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:40,160
Tell your friends to bully their parents as well.

4293
03:18:40,360 --> 03:18:43,340
And I bully other people to play Metal Gear.

4294
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:46,380
It's through community efforts like these that the world comes together in harmony and connection.

4295
03:18:46,840 --> 03:18:52,580
And it's only through this connection that we'll defeat time Dracula once and for all.

4296
03:18:53,100 --> 03:18:55,920
Don't let the time-traveling vampires win.

4297
03:18:56,260 --> 03:19:01,220
Buy The Stanley Parable 2 and pledge to support all sequels.

4298
03:19:01,220 --> 03:19:05,960
For today, tomorrow, and into the great, unknowable beyond.

4299
03:19:09,500 --> 03:19:10,460
The end.

4300
03:19:11,100 --> 03:19:11,700
Nice.

4301
03:19:18,910 --> 03:19:20,450
Well, that was fun.

4302
03:19:20,630 --> 03:19:21,130
Oh, wait!

4303
03:19:23,950 --> 03:19:24,750
Hold on.

4304
03:19:26,230 --> 03:19:27,610
There was one more thing.

4305
03:19:28,790 --> 03:19:31,070
There was one more thing at the very end!

4306
03:19:34,750 --> 03:19:35,950
Oh, no!

4307
03:19:38,330 --> 03:19:39,210
One second.

4308
03:19:40,230 --> 03:19:41,170
One second.

4309
03:19:46,060 --> 03:19:46,400
Billy!

4310
03:19:50,260 --> 03:19:52,400
In memoriam of Billy!

4311
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:53,780
1953.

4312
03:19:54,580 --> 03:19:55,260
1956.

4313
03:19:57,740 --> 03:19:58,820
Oh, God!

4314
03:19:59,040 --> 03:19:59,720
Billy!

4315
03:20:03,370 --> 03:20:04,430
Oh, no, no!

4316
03:20:05,170 --> 03:20:06,670
Was that everything, though?

4317
03:20:07,670 --> 03:20:08,690
Yeah, okay.

4318
03:20:12,350 --> 03:20:15,310
Okay, I'm continuing the game, everybody.

4319
03:20:15,590 --> 03:20:17,590
I think we can actually finally exit.

4320
03:20:18,670 --> 03:20:20,690
I think we can actually finally leave.

4321
03:20:22,130 --> 03:20:23,310
Curse you, time Dracula.

4322
03:20:25,170 --> 03:20:25,830
Curse you!

4323
03:20:29,490 --> 03:20:29,930
Okay.

4324
03:20:30,090 --> 03:20:31,570
This is all new for me now.

4325
03:20:31,890 --> 03:20:33,410
Actually, I've never even watched that.

4326
03:20:33,470 --> 03:20:35,310
I think I was going to watch it before, and I forgot.

4327
03:20:35,690 --> 03:20:36,390
So now...

4328
03:20:36,390 --> 03:20:36,810
Oh!

4329
03:20:36,910 --> 03:20:38,170
Have you seen everything you wanted to?

4330
03:20:38,390 --> 03:20:38,670
Yeah.

4331
03:20:38,670 --> 03:20:39,570
Ready to move on now?

4332
03:20:39,890 --> 03:20:42,610
Mint Phantom is my favorite React content beat-em-er.

4333
03:20:42,830 --> 03:20:43,270
Now!

4334
03:20:44,290 --> 03:20:44,730
Oh.

4335
03:20:47,510 --> 03:20:47,950
Oh.

4336
03:20:48,050 --> 03:20:48,130
Oh.

4337
03:20:48,130 --> 03:20:48,890
Whoa.

4338
03:20:56,940 --> 03:20:57,900
New mugs!

4339
03:21:00,020 --> 03:21:01,560
Why does he look so scary?

4340
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:03,940
It's like, uh...

4341
03:21:05,100 --> 03:21:05,640
What's that?

4342
03:21:05,740 --> 03:21:06,300
What's that game?

4343
03:21:06,900 --> 03:21:08,040
Layers of Stanley.

4344
03:21:08,360 --> 03:21:08,700
Oh!

4345
03:21:09,080 --> 03:21:10,580
Please no screenshots, everybody!

4346
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:11,280
Oh, what's this?

4347
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:12,800
So, Stanley.

4348
03:21:12,960 --> 03:21:13,760
What do you think?

4349
03:21:13,920 --> 03:21:15,860
Do you like all of the new features?

4350
03:21:15,980 --> 03:21:16,360
I really do!

4351
03:21:16,480 --> 03:21:22,540
Yes, I know it's not exactly clear yet how exactly these features will come together as one single coherent video game.

4352
03:21:22,540 --> 03:21:24,600
I can feel it in my soul.

4353
03:21:24,700 --> 03:21:24,920
Can I hear you?

4354
03:21:25,180 --> 03:21:26,260
It's going to work.

4355
03:21:26,400 --> 03:21:29,040
There's definitely a good game in there somewhere.

4356
03:21:29,300 --> 03:21:31,080
Say, let's do an experiment.

4357
03:21:31,320 --> 03:21:31,520
Okay.

4358
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:38,720
I'll arrange these new features together, and we'll see whether or not it coheres into a meaningful gameplay experience.

4359
03:21:39,260 --> 03:21:39,520
Okay.

4360
03:21:40,720 --> 03:21:41,760
No screenshots!

4361
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:42,540
No screenshots!

4362
03:21:42,900 --> 03:21:43,800
Are you ready?

4363
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:44,360
Yes.

4364
03:21:44,520 --> 03:21:45,040
Here it is.

4365
03:21:45,380 --> 03:21:46,660
I give you...

4366
03:21:46,660 --> 03:21:49,080
The Stanley Parable 2.

4367
03:21:49,980 --> 03:21:50,500
Oh!

4368
03:21:50,760 --> 03:21:50,960
Oh!

4369
03:21:51,880 --> 03:21:52,320
Oh.

4370
03:21:53,280 --> 03:21:53,720
Oh...

4371
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:55,620
Um.

4372
03:21:56,540 --> 03:21:57,460
Well, um...

4373
03:21:57,460 --> 03:21:59,140
I mean, there's potential here, right?

4374
03:21:59,220 --> 03:22:00,400
It's sort of...

4375
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:01,400
Okay, never mind.

4376
03:22:01,940 --> 03:22:02,560
Hold on.

4377
03:22:02,680 --> 03:22:04,220
Let me do a different arrangement.

4378
03:22:05,140 --> 03:22:05,980
Okay, yes.

4379
03:22:06,220 --> 03:22:06,620
Yes!

4380
03:22:06,680 --> 03:22:08,220
This is much better.

4381
03:22:08,300 --> 03:22:09,540
I feel like I could've done this.

4382
03:22:09,540 --> 03:22:10,200
I'm Jim.

4383
03:22:10,300 --> 03:22:11,120
Oh, my gosh, Jim!

4384
03:22:11,780 --> 03:22:11,860
Here we go.

4385
03:22:13,440 --> 03:22:13,880
Uh...

4386
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:14,680
No...

4387
03:22:14,680 --> 03:22:17,260
Who am I kidding, Stanley?

4388
03:22:17,360 --> 03:22:18,100
The Jump Circle.

4389
03:22:18,340 --> 03:22:18,640
Whoa!

4390
03:22:18,840 --> 03:22:20,240
This isn't a coherent video game at all.

4391
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:20,940
It's a lot of games.

4392
03:22:33,340 --> 03:22:34,740
Hmm...

4393
03:22:37,440 --> 03:22:38,840
Oh!

4394
03:22:44,420 --> 03:22:45,820
Okay.

4395
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:52,360
Tastefully, of course, of course.

4396
03:22:53,060 --> 03:22:54,180
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.

4397
03:22:54,180 --> 03:22:54,440
Thank you!

4398
03:22:58,020 --> 03:22:59,840
Why can't it be so sad in there?

4399
03:23:03,280 --> 03:23:03,740
Oooh!

4400
03:23:10,240 --> 03:23:11,380
Stanley Parable 2!

4401
03:23:12,680 --> 03:23:13,140
Okay.

4402
03:23:14,500 --> 03:23:15,520
Okay, I'm excited.

4403
03:23:18,460 --> 03:23:19,540
I'm closing my eyes.

4404
03:23:21,520 --> 03:23:22,640
Oh!

4405
03:23:24,820 --> 03:23:26,180
The Stan...

4406
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:26,380
Oooh!

4407
03:23:27,420 --> 03:23:28,720
P.T.?

4408
03:23:29,400 --> 03:23:31,680
The Stanley Parable 2.

4409
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:35,400
Wow!

4410
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:40,300
It's kinda creepy!

4411
03:23:41,540 --> 03:23:42,720
Quit the desktop.

4412
03:23:44,400 --> 03:23:48,340
I guess we gotta begin the game, you guys.

4413
03:23:48,720 --> 03:23:49,600
Woah!

4414
03:23:54,740 --> 03:23:55,640
Click to skip.

4415
03:23:55,740 --> 03:23:57,740
This is the story of a man named Stanley.

4416
03:24:00,120 --> 03:24:05,580
Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427.

4417
03:24:06,560 --> 03:24:09,540
Employee number 427's job was simple.

4418
03:24:09,740 --> 03:24:14,560
He sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.

4419
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:17,300
Orders came to him through a monitor...

4420
03:24:17,300 --> 03:24:18,040
Oh my gosh, wait.

4421
03:24:18,180 --> 03:24:18,740
Our bucket?

4422
03:24:18,900 --> 03:24:19,460
Where's the bucket?

4423
03:24:20,020 --> 03:24:21,500
How long to push them?

4424
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:22,840
And in what order?

4425
03:24:22,840 --> 03:24:24,260
Yeah, we got the balloons and everything.

4426
03:24:24,400 --> 03:24:29,700
This is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year.

4427
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:33,020
Although others might have considered it sorely.

4428
03:24:33,400 --> 03:24:36,700
Stanley relished every moment that the boys came in.

4429
03:24:36,960 --> 03:24:43,300
But though he had been made exactly for this job, Stanley was happy.

4430
03:24:43,340 --> 03:24:44,160
He was happy.

4431
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:48,940
And then one day, something very peculiar happened.

4432
03:24:49,360 --> 03:24:51,920
Something that would forever change Stanley.

4433
03:24:51,920 --> 03:24:54,500
Something he would never quite forget.

4434
03:24:54,940 --> 03:24:57,720
He had been at his desk for nearly an hour.

4435
03:24:57,800 --> 03:25:03,700
When he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow.

4436
03:25:04,240 --> 03:25:05,200
The balloons!

4437
03:25:06,280 --> 03:25:08,240
No, I wanted the other balloons.

4438
03:25:09,240 --> 03:25:11,060
I wanted the other ones.

4439
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:13,560
Never in all his years at the company had this happened.

4440
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:15,480
This complete isolation.

4441
03:25:16,280 --> 03:25:18,380
Something was very clearly wrong.

4442
03:25:19,240 --> 03:25:19,840
Shocked.

4443
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:20,920
Frozen solid.

4444
03:25:20,920 --> 03:25:24,840
Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.

4445
03:25:25,280 --> 03:25:31,480
But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

4446
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:33,460
I hope you get well eventually, babe.

4447
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:35,920
Happy 12th birthday, babe.

4448
03:25:38,240 --> 03:25:43,180
I like how you guys both said the opposite things at the same time.

4449
03:25:44,040 --> 03:25:45,440
Okay, here we go, I guess.

4450
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:48,480
All of his co-workers were gone.

4451
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:49,700
What could it mean?

4452
03:25:50,120 --> 03:25:52,220
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

4453
03:25:52,300 --> 03:25:54,020
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

4454
03:25:55,560 --> 03:25:58,160
Happy 12th birthday, step-niece!

4455
03:25:58,800 --> 03:26:00,840
My favorite step-niece in the world.

4456
03:26:03,240 --> 03:26:04,820
Stanley picked up the bucket.

4457
03:26:11,980 --> 03:26:16,220
We got a bucket.

4458
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:23,060
Stanley clutched the bucket tightly to his chest and entered the door on his left.

4459
03:26:26,600 --> 03:26:27,520
What have I done?

4460
03:26:29,100 --> 03:26:30,780
I mean, I know I like the bucket.

4461
03:26:32,940 --> 03:26:36,580
I know the bucket, like, gives me that... that...

4462
03:26:45,760 --> 03:26:47,220
What should I do, bucket?

4463
03:26:47,300 --> 03:26:47,920
What should I do?

4464
03:26:50,280 --> 03:26:50,720
Okay.

4465
03:26:51,440 --> 03:26:53,720
This was not the correct way to the meeting room.

4466
03:26:53,720 --> 03:26:56,540
But Stanley had felt the bucket calling to him.

4467
03:26:56,680 --> 03:27:00,620
Telling him that the employee lounge was simply the place to be.

4468
03:27:00,740 --> 03:27:02,740
Simply the place to be.

4469
03:27:02,740 --> 03:27:03,340
And here it was.

4470
03:27:03,640 --> 03:27:05,380
Had the bucket turned out to be correct?

4471
03:27:05,420 --> 03:27:05,760
Yes!

4472
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:07,220
Was this better than the meeting room?

4473
03:27:07,540 --> 03:27:09,080
Yes, Stanley thought to himself.

4474
03:27:09,380 --> 03:27:10,760
Yes, perhaps it truly was.

4475
03:27:10,900 --> 03:27:11,560
Perhaps it truly was.

4476
03:27:11,580 --> 03:27:13,640
How insightful the bucket turned out to be.

4477
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:15,780
Oh my god, everything is re-dubbed with the bucket.

4478
03:27:19,140 --> 03:27:20,560
The bucket's so awesome.

4479
03:27:20,600 --> 03:27:21,100
Never mind.

4480
03:27:21,240 --> 03:27:22,660
The bucket was wrong.

4481
03:27:22,660 --> 03:27:23,280
Uh, never.

4482
03:27:23,540 --> 03:27:24,220
Not at all.

4483
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:26,920
Stanley took the door on his left to go back to the meeting room.

4484
03:27:27,160 --> 03:27:28,600
What does this way go to?

4485
03:27:28,680 --> 03:27:30,320
Oh, this one is, uh...

4486
03:27:30,780 --> 03:27:32,340
Yeah, where I fell before.

4487
03:27:33,640 --> 03:27:34,880
What was this way again?

4488
03:27:34,980 --> 03:27:35,140
Oh!

4489
03:27:36,020 --> 03:27:37,080
And this way...

4490
03:27:37,080 --> 03:27:38,700
Oh, we went downstairs.

4491
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:39,440
Okay.

4492
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:42,960
Yeah, the bucket's never wrong.

4493
03:27:44,820 --> 03:27:46,220
Kinda wanna ride it, though.

4494
03:27:46,240 --> 03:27:47,840
No, said the bucket.

4495
03:27:47,900 --> 03:27:48,240
No!

4496
03:27:48,280 --> 03:27:49,680
Don't go to the meeting room.

4497
03:27:49,860 --> 03:27:50,980
Go somewhere else.

4498
03:27:51,160 --> 03:27:52,420
A cargo lift, yes.

4499
03:27:52,420 --> 03:27:53,420
Go there.

4500
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:54,000
Go there.

4501
03:27:54,220 --> 03:27:54,760
Go to the cargo lift.

4502
03:27:54,860 --> 03:27:55,920
Go to the cargo lift.

4503
03:27:56,740 --> 03:27:58,820
No, don't go to the meeting room.

4504
03:28:00,720 --> 03:28:02,120
Good, said the bucket.

4505
03:28:02,360 --> 03:28:04,640
Now ride the lift all the way to the top.

4506
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:06,860
There's something up there I need you to do.

4507
03:28:07,100 --> 03:28:08,680
Oh my god, there's even a balloon at the top.

4508
03:28:09,060 --> 03:28:10,640
Well, there's several.

4509
03:28:11,280 --> 03:28:14,240
It should have alarmed him, of course, because buckets can't talk.

4510
03:28:14,500 --> 03:28:17,200
But Stanley chose not to think about this obvious fact.

4511
03:28:17,200 --> 03:28:17,720
We're gonna go.

4512
03:28:17,860 --> 03:28:18,360
We're gonna go.

4513
03:28:18,840 --> 03:28:19,660
Because the bucket...

4514
03:28:19,660 --> 03:28:20,320
Because the bucket...

4515
03:28:20,320 --> 03:28:23,680
And he unthinkingly did whatever the bucket asked.

4516
03:28:23,860 --> 03:28:24,960
Okay, sounds good.

4517
03:28:25,900 --> 03:28:26,500
No.

4518
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:31,740
In here, said the bucket.

4519
03:28:31,880 --> 03:28:33,780
Go into this dark room over here.

4520
03:28:33,880 --> 03:28:34,280
Over here?

4521
03:28:34,580 --> 03:28:36,500
Stanley once again obeyed blindly.

4522
03:28:36,880 --> 03:28:38,520
This room's not very dark.

4523
03:28:39,880 --> 03:28:42,100
This room's pretty bright, actually.

4524
03:28:42,700 --> 03:28:43,300
Oh!

4525
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:44,300
Oh.

4526
03:28:44,500 --> 03:28:45,040
Oh.

4527
03:28:45,080 --> 03:28:45,520
Oh.

4528
03:28:46,120 --> 03:28:46,720
Oh.

4529
03:28:47,160 --> 03:28:48,480
Are you sure, bucket?

4530
03:28:48,900 --> 03:28:49,500
Oh.

4531
03:28:49,500 --> 03:28:49,580
Oh.

4532
03:28:50,740 --> 03:28:51,180
Okay.

4533
03:28:55,920 --> 03:28:58,480
Now pick up the phone, said the bucket.

4534
03:28:58,620 --> 03:29:03,160
Pick up the phone, and it will take us back home, where we can go about life together.

4535
03:29:03,680 --> 03:29:04,080
Really?

4536
03:29:05,840 --> 03:29:07,940
Thanks for the five gift items you...

4537
03:29:07,940 --> 03:29:08,900
Oh, customer, thank you!

4538
03:29:09,180 --> 03:29:13,140
This is the sad story of a man named Stanley and his bucket.

4539
03:29:13,300 --> 03:29:13,900
Where's my bucket?

4540
03:29:14,060 --> 03:29:18,780
Once upon a time, I gave Stanley a bucket because I thought he was lonely and could use a friend.

4541
03:29:19,500 --> 03:29:23,620
And then, very distressingly, he began to believe the bucket could speak to him.

4542
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:26,640
Is this my house?

4543
03:29:27,420 --> 03:29:31,860
Oh my god, Stanley lives in an Ikea, like, uh, setup.

4544
03:29:32,940 --> 03:29:33,640
There's the bucket!

4545
03:29:34,520 --> 03:29:35,620
Hello, Stanley, it's me.

4546
03:29:35,700 --> 03:29:35,880
Oh.

4547
03:29:35,920 --> 03:29:37,960
Hello, Stanley, it's me, your bucket.

4548
03:29:38,140 --> 03:29:40,180
Press U to take me to walk with...

4549
03:29:40,180 --> 03:29:40,760
Walk with you.

4550
03:29:42,600 --> 03:29:43,040
Oh.

4551
03:29:43,240 --> 03:29:48,000
The Stanley Parable Reassurance Bucket was merely meant to provide the comforting glow of companionship.

4552
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:49,140
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for that, buddy.

4553
03:29:49,140 --> 03:29:49,320
Take care.

4554
03:29:49,320 --> 03:29:49,480
Bye.

4555
03:29:49,480 --> 03:29:49,960
Thank you.

4556
03:29:51,920 --> 03:29:52,620
Thank you.

4557
03:29:53,180 --> 03:29:53,820
Thank you.

4558
03:29:54,380 --> 03:29:56,240
Oh, here it is.

4559
03:29:58,480 --> 03:30:00,900
Press O to take me back home with you.

4560
03:30:03,060 --> 03:30:05,140
Lately, I've been concerned about him.

4561
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:07,080
Wouldn't you be concerned as well?

4562
03:30:07,300 --> 03:30:11,540
To see him delusional like this, obsessing over an inanimate metal object?

4563
03:30:11,840 --> 03:30:15,140
I want to say something to him, but I don't know how I can convince him.

4564
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:15,560
Where's my bucket?

4565
03:30:15,560 --> 03:30:17,240
I don't know if he'll listen to me.

4566
03:30:17,400 --> 03:30:18,500
Thought I lost him for a second.

4567
03:30:18,980 --> 03:30:19,460
Oh.

4568
03:30:19,460 --> 03:30:20,100
Okay.

4569
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:22,000
Press J to go back to work.

4570
03:30:24,360 --> 03:30:25,660
I'll try anyway.

4571
03:30:26,040 --> 03:30:28,080
Stanley, can you hear me?

4572
03:30:28,140 --> 03:30:28,520
Bucket.

4573
03:30:28,800 --> 03:30:29,320
Bucket.

4574
03:30:29,740 --> 03:30:31,100
Can you hear me, bucket?

4575
03:30:31,320 --> 03:30:32,180
It can't think.

4576
03:30:32,580 --> 03:30:33,100
Bucket.

4577
03:30:33,100 --> 03:30:33,480
Bucket.

4578
03:30:33,480 --> 03:30:33,880
Where are you?

4579
03:30:33,960 --> 03:30:34,320
Oh, thank you.

4580
03:30:34,440 --> 03:30:39,980
All it would ever truly do for you is effectively transfer a liquid from one location to a different location.

4581
03:30:39,980 --> 03:30:40,820
I don't hear anybody else.

4582
03:30:40,820 --> 03:30:41,560
I only hear the bucket.

4583
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:41,860
That's it.

4584
03:30:41,860 --> 03:30:43,520
It doesn't do anything else.

4585
03:30:45,160 --> 03:30:46,840
Don't listen to the loud man.

4586
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:49,040
Press R for us to go back home.

4587
03:30:49,160 --> 03:30:49,440
Okay.

4588
03:30:51,200 --> 03:30:51,640
Oh.

4589
03:30:51,880 --> 03:30:53,220
You see, he's not listening.

4590
03:30:53,560 --> 03:30:55,560
He's still taking orders from the bucket.

4591
03:30:55,900 --> 03:30:56,340
Bucket.

4592
03:30:56,340 --> 03:30:57,700
You know, once upon a time...

4593
03:30:57,700 --> 03:30:57,780
Bucket.

4594
03:30:57,780 --> 03:30:59,100
...it was me he took orders from.

4595
03:30:59,120 --> 03:30:59,480
Bucket.

4596
03:30:59,480 --> 03:30:59,500
Where are you, bucket?

4597
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:00,900
Me he trusted and listened to.

4598
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:03,060
Now all he cares about is his awful bucket.

4599
03:31:03,060 --> 03:31:03,560
Where's the bucket?

4600
03:31:03,720 --> 03:31:04,160
Where's the bucket?

4601
03:31:04,520 --> 03:31:05,180
Where's the bucket?

4602
03:31:05,880 --> 03:31:06,420
Where's the bucket?

4603
03:31:06,580 --> 03:31:06,880
Where's the bucket?

4604
03:31:06,880 --> 03:31:06,920
Where's the bucket?

4605
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:07,200
Where's my bucket?

4606
03:31:08,900 --> 03:31:09,840
Where's my bucket?

4607
03:31:10,100 --> 03:31:10,540
Narrator.

4608
03:31:10,860 --> 03:31:11,180
Oh, here.

4609
03:31:12,460 --> 03:31:15,840
Press O to ignore anyone in your life except for me.

4610
03:31:18,740 --> 03:31:19,440
Well, guys.

4611
03:31:23,920 --> 03:31:27,000
Press O to ignore anyone in your life except for me.

4612
03:31:35,310 --> 03:31:36,570
That's a lot of O's.

4613
03:31:36,890 --> 03:31:37,730
Thank you.

4614
03:31:39,830 --> 03:31:40,630
It's sad.

4615
03:31:40,870 --> 03:31:42,690
I suppose he doesn't need me anymore.

4616
03:31:43,070 --> 03:31:46,030
From now on, he's just going to cling to this bucket.

4617
03:31:46,110 --> 03:31:48,090
This cold, empty bucket.

4618
03:31:48,290 --> 03:31:50,550
This sort of shiny bucket.

4619
03:31:51,290 --> 03:31:52,730
Well, I'll give it this.

4620
03:31:52,830 --> 03:31:54,650
The bucket does have a nice shine to it.

4621
03:31:54,670 --> 03:31:55,030
Yeah, it does.

4622
03:31:56,270 --> 03:31:58,970
You believe I'm real, don't you, Stanley?

4623
03:31:59,330 --> 03:32:01,250
Press H to go back home.

4624
03:32:03,350 --> 03:32:09,050
Yes, I suppose on closer inspection that it doesn't quite look like your average hardware store bucket.

4625
03:32:09,490 --> 03:32:11,010
It's just a little more, um...

4626
03:32:11,010 --> 03:32:12,330
What am I trying to say?

4627
03:32:13,190 --> 03:32:13,750
Sturdier.

4628
03:32:13,990 --> 03:32:16,270
More capable of transporting liquid.

4629
03:32:16,590 --> 03:32:17,030
Yeah.

4630
03:32:17,030 --> 03:32:17,170
See?

4631
03:32:17,170 --> 03:32:20,850
Like it would be better at moving an amount of water from one room to another.

4632
03:32:22,850 --> 03:32:24,650
Press R to relive the scene.

4633
03:32:24,650 --> 03:32:26,530
Same day with me, over and over.

4634
03:32:30,410 --> 03:32:32,390
Oh my God, what am I saying?

4635
03:32:32,970 --> 03:32:35,630
Better at carrying water from room to room.

4636
03:32:35,730 --> 03:32:36,330
It's a bucket.

4637
03:32:36,530 --> 03:32:38,250
It's literally just a bucket.

4638
03:32:38,890 --> 03:32:44,770
Why do I feel some need to point out the ways in which it's so much more than just a regular bucket?

4639
03:32:46,650 --> 03:32:50,810
Press I to go home, to work to home, to work to home.

4640
03:32:52,810 --> 03:32:53,730
Oh no.

4641
03:32:54,190 --> 03:32:54,710
I'm...

4642
03:32:54,710 --> 03:32:56,010
I'm having feelings.

4643
03:32:56,030 --> 03:32:56,090
I'm...

4644
03:32:56,670 --> 03:32:57,510
For the bucket.

4645
03:32:57,710 --> 03:32:59,430
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4646
03:32:59,490 --> 03:33:00,110
What's going on?

4647
03:33:00,190 --> 03:33:01,850
Why do I want to be with the bucket?

4648
03:33:02,030 --> 03:33:03,730
Hear what the bucket has to say.

4649
03:33:03,830 --> 03:33:04,970
Do anything it asks.

4650
03:33:05,210 --> 03:33:06,110
What's wrong with me?

4651
03:33:06,130 --> 03:33:06,790
I don't understand.

4652
03:33:07,250 --> 03:33:07,690
Perhaps...

4653
03:33:07,690 --> 03:33:10,530
Perhaps if I had the bucket, this would be less confusing.

4654
03:33:10,830 --> 03:33:11,170
Yes.

4655
03:33:11,550 --> 03:33:15,010
The bucket could tell me what to do in this troublesome situation.

4656
03:33:16,110 --> 03:33:18,290
Is the bucket waiting for me on the bed?

4657
03:33:20,470 --> 03:33:21,350
B-bucket.

4658
03:33:21,370 --> 03:33:22,310
I mean...

4659
03:33:23,290 --> 03:33:24,450
This is so nice.

4660
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:25,170
I didn't...

4661
03:33:25,630 --> 03:33:26,070
I didn't...

4662
03:33:26,090 --> 03:33:26,550
I didn't...

4663
03:33:27,090 --> 03:33:27,630
You know...

4664
03:33:27,630 --> 03:33:30,890
I thought you would be too tired after such a long day.

4665
03:33:31,390 --> 03:33:32,210
But you...

4666
03:33:32,770 --> 03:33:33,210
Even...

4667
03:33:33,210 --> 03:33:35,730
Even despite that, you put all of this together for me?

4668
03:33:36,670 --> 03:33:37,110
Bucket.

4669
03:33:40,430 --> 03:33:41,310
I mean...

4670
03:33:41,310 --> 03:33:41,970
Wow.

4671
03:33:42,050 --> 03:33:43,030
It's just so beautiful.

4672
03:33:43,350 --> 03:33:44,210
It's just...

4673
03:33:45,310 --> 03:33:46,190
No bucket.

4674
03:33:47,350 --> 03:33:48,230
No bucket.

4675
03:33:49,290 --> 03:33:51,050
Stanley, give me the bucket.

4676
03:33:51,170 --> 03:33:51,830
Give it to me.

4677
03:33:51,850 --> 03:33:53,150
Give me the bucket, Stanley.

4678
03:33:53,290 --> 03:33:54,030
I need it.

4679
03:33:54,110 --> 03:33:54,450
No!

4680
03:33:54,470 --> 03:33:55,070
Give it to me now.

4681
03:33:55,190 --> 03:33:55,990
Give it or I'll...

4682
03:33:55,990 --> 03:33:56,030
No!

4683
03:33:56,030 --> 03:33:56,050
No!

4684
03:33:56,090 --> 03:33:56,490
Close your eyes.

4685
03:33:58,470 --> 03:33:58,990
Go

4686
03:34:02,760 --> 03:34:04,140
back to work, Stanley.

4687
03:34:04,700 --> 03:34:07,100
Go back to work, Stanley.

4688
03:34:14,360 --> 03:34:14,880
Bucket?

4689
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:18,640
Bucket?

4690
03:34:21,420 --> 03:34:23,340
All of his co-workers were gone.

4691
03:34:23,560 --> 03:34:24,560
What could it mean?

4692
03:34:25,200 --> 03:34:25,720
Bucket!

4693
03:34:25,740 --> 03:34:27,160
Stanley decided to go to the meeting room.

4694
03:34:27,340 --> 03:34:28,960
Perhaps he had simply missed a memo.

4695
03:34:29,460 --> 03:34:31,620
Stanley lifted the bucket into his arms.

4696
03:34:31,660 --> 03:34:34,260
And a wave of comfort rushed over him.

4697
03:34:34,300 --> 03:34:34,380
Oh!

4698
03:34:34,940 --> 03:34:35,440
That was...

4699
03:34:35,440 --> 03:34:37,000
Men's Phantom, parasocial for a bucket.

4700
03:34:37,220 --> 03:34:38,000
Trust the bucket.

4701
03:34:38,060 --> 03:34:38,780
Believe in the bucket.

4702
03:34:41,180 --> 03:34:42,180
That was...

4703
03:34:43,020 --> 03:34:44,320
Such a fun ending.

4704
03:34:44,600 --> 03:34:45,620
That was so funny.

4705
03:34:45,880 --> 03:34:46,740
I loved that.

4706
03:34:47,060 --> 03:34:47,460
Oh, wait.

4707
03:34:48,140 --> 03:34:48,640
Oh!

4708
03:34:48,640 --> 03:34:49,500
It got the second input!

4709
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:53,300
How is that in there?

4710
03:34:54,520 --> 03:34:56,000
I think though...

4711
03:34:56,000 --> 03:34:57,520
I think I might...

4712
03:34:58,160 --> 03:35:00,200
Call it quits here.

4713
03:35:00,340 --> 03:35:01,080
Buckets on my doko.

4714
03:35:01,380 --> 03:35:02,740
I wish there was a way...

4715
03:35:02,740 --> 03:35:02,940
Oh!

4716
03:35:03,300 --> 03:35:04,380
Sequel has now published.

4717
03:35:04,380 --> 03:35:04,600
Pause.

4718
03:35:04,760 --> 03:35:05,900
Wait, this is so crazy!

4719
03:35:08,000 --> 03:35:11,260
I wish there was a way to know how many endings you had left.

4720
03:35:11,420 --> 03:35:11,840
You know what I mean?

4721
03:35:12,740 --> 03:35:13,740
That ending was fantastic.

4722
03:35:13,780 --> 03:35:15,160
I think that was a good one to end on.

4723
03:35:15,260 --> 03:35:15,680
I think.

4724
03:35:16,960 --> 03:35:17,860
I think so.

4725
03:35:20,140 --> 03:35:21,360
Send the bucket to space.

4726
03:35:23,400 --> 03:35:24,760
Achieve... Oh, I guess an achievement.

4727
03:35:24,860 --> 03:35:25,520
Yeah, probably.

4728
03:35:25,720 --> 03:35:26,100
Let me see.

4729
03:35:27,080 --> 03:35:29,520
Oh, I've unlocked only 4 out of 11?

4730
03:35:29,860 --> 03:35:31,140
Wait, view my achievements.

4731
03:35:32,760 --> 03:35:34,660
Uh, quit the game and start it again.

4732
03:35:35,060 --> 03:35:35,540
Wait.

4733
03:35:39,370 --> 03:35:41,410
Oh, some of these... what is it?

4734
03:35:42,090 --> 03:35:44,130
A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A...

4735
03:35:44,130 --> 03:35:45,090
Oh, the test achievement!

4736
03:35:45,270 --> 03:35:45,750
Please ignore!

4737
03:35:47,850 --> 03:35:50,370
Speedrun, complete the Stanley Parable in under 4 minutes.

4738
03:35:52,690 --> 03:35:54,790
Don't play the Stanley Parable for 10 years.

4739
03:35:55,050 --> 03:35:57,610
It doesn't have a list of the achievements.

4740
03:36:01,210 --> 03:36:02,210
Why so blushy?

4741
03:36:02,210 --> 03:36:02,610
Oh, sorry.

4742
03:36:02,990 --> 03:36:04,310
Just because I was holding on to the bucket, you know?

4743
03:36:04,410 --> 03:36:05,510
Bucket will last forever.

4744
03:36:06,050 --> 03:36:07,550
Long live the bucket!

4745
03:36:09,990 --> 03:36:11,190
Thanks for a month!

4746
03:36:11,310 --> 03:36:11,750
Thank you!

4747
03:36:15,150 --> 03:36:15,610
But...

4748
03:36:16,870 --> 03:36:17,330
Yeah.

4749
03:36:21,160 --> 03:36:21,940
Let me see.

4750
03:36:23,300 --> 03:36:26,660
But yeah, there is one that says don't play the Stanley Parable for 10 years.

4751
03:36:27,380 --> 03:36:31,400
And then, play the Stanley Parable for the entire duration of a Tuesday.

4752
03:36:32,700 --> 03:36:34,720
Wait, is that starting at like 12 AM?

4753
03:36:34,960 --> 03:36:35,360
2...

4754
03:36:35,360 --> 03:36:37,680
2, 11, 59 PM?

4755
03:36:38,280 --> 03:36:39,560
This is a great...

4756
03:36:39,560 --> 03:36:40,940
Was this great to have on a birthday Thanksgiving?

4757
03:36:42,020 --> 03:36:42,660
Stuffed Shark!

4758
03:36:44,540 --> 03:36:47,520
Happy birthday to you.

4759
03:36:48,660 --> 03:36:51,460
Happy birthday to you.

4760
03:36:52,600 --> 03:36:54,720
Happy birthday, Stuffed.

4761
03:36:54,720 --> 03:36:56,840
Sometimes I say, stupid shark.

4762
03:36:58,680 --> 03:37:01,280
Sorry for calling you.

4763
03:37:01,280 --> 03:37:01,820
Stupid.

4764
03:37:04,460 --> 03:37:05,440
Happy birthday!

4765
03:37:06,540 --> 03:37:07,360
Happy birthday!

4766
03:37:08,300 --> 03:37:09,540
Thank you for the super chat.

4767
03:37:12,880 --> 03:37:13,580
But yeah.

4768
03:37:13,780 --> 03:37:14,840
This was a lot of fun.

4769
03:37:15,560 --> 03:37:19,080
It was good seeing things that I've never seen before.

4770
03:37:19,400 --> 03:37:21,720
And remembering things that I have seen before.

4771
03:37:22,120 --> 03:37:22,640
Sometimes.

4772
03:37:23,580 --> 03:37:25,060
And then also...

4773
03:37:26,420 --> 03:37:27,840
My game not breaking.

4774
03:37:27,940 --> 03:37:30,160
So I could do the bucket, you know?

4775
03:37:31,280 --> 03:37:32,100
Okay.

4776
03:37:34,620 --> 03:37:35,040
I should play the bucket, too.

4777
03:37:35,040 --> 03:37:35,380
But...

4778
03:37:36,280 --> 03:37:37,120
I think...

4779
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:37,600
I don't know.

4780
03:37:37,680 --> 03:37:39,900
How many endings are there even?

4781
03:37:44,910 --> 03:37:46,650
Be wary of the time vampires.

4782
03:37:47,190 --> 03:37:47,610
Yeah.

4783
03:37:47,610 --> 03:37:48,010
Yeah.

4784
03:37:48,030 --> 03:37:48,290
Right?

4785
03:37:49,350 --> 03:37:50,230
Oh, my gosh.

4786
03:37:51,930 --> 03:37:52,710
Five clicks?

4787
03:37:52,950 --> 03:37:53,070
No.

4788
03:37:53,170 --> 03:37:54,210
I'm going to do 10 clicks.

4789
03:37:54,390 --> 03:37:55,310
I'm going to do 11 clicks.

4790
03:37:55,470 --> 03:37:55,950
I'm going to be...

4791
03:37:55,950 --> 03:37:56,950
I'm going to do 50 clicks.

4792
03:37:57,170 --> 03:37:58,690
I don't even know what you're talking about.

4793
03:37:58,950 --> 03:38:01,190
And you keep spamming five clicks.

4794
03:38:01,470 --> 03:38:03,970
Why do I feel like I'm in the ice monkey all over the place?

4795
03:38:04,710 --> 03:38:05,990
Thank you for the bucket stream.

4796
03:38:06,210 --> 03:38:09,930
Just wanted to say, even if you didn't win your match with Fillion last night was fantastic.

4797
03:38:10,850 --> 03:38:13,170
Even though I teleported and then I...

4798
03:38:14,050 --> 03:38:16,270
Even though I teleported and then...

4799
03:38:16,730 --> 03:38:17,930
And then I...

4800
03:38:18,670 --> 03:38:21,090
20 plus endings and the bucket doubles it?

4801
03:38:21,110 --> 03:38:21,470
No way.

4802
03:38:21,590 --> 03:38:22,610
Oh my god, stupid shark!

4803
03:38:22,990 --> 03:38:24,850
Thank you for the 20, you have to thank you!

4804
03:38:25,710 --> 03:38:27,310
0, 0, 0, ice monkey.

4805
03:38:27,450 --> 03:38:29,810
5 click, 5 click, 5 click, ice monkey.

4806
03:38:34,580 --> 03:38:37,020
I teleported behind her and it didn't even make a difference.

4807
03:38:39,100 --> 03:38:39,500
SMH.

4808
03:38:40,180 --> 03:38:40,580
SMH!

4809
03:38:41,080 --> 03:38:43,760
But it's okay, I beat Matara and that's all that really mattered.

4810
03:38:43,880 --> 03:38:47,360
Plus, I think I would have felt really bad if I had made it to the finals because...

4811
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:50,520
I was kind of a joke entry, so...

4812
03:38:51,560 --> 03:38:54,320
I was kind of a joke entry, so... you know.

4813
03:38:56,760 --> 03:38:58,180
But it was a lot of fun.

4814
03:39:00,480 --> 03:39:00,880
Actually...

4815
03:39:01,280 --> 03:39:06,220
I'm going to move us over to the maid cafe.

4816
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:07,840
Give me a second.

4817
03:39:08,480 --> 03:39:10,240
First off, I gotta change.

4818
03:39:16,940 --> 03:39:19,280
I'm not naked, I'm just...

4819
03:39:20,140 --> 03:39:22,280
I'm not naked, I'm just...

4820
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:29,240
Anyway...

4821
03:39:32,020 --> 03:39:33,240
Hold on, I'm getting dressed.

4822
03:39:34,880 --> 03:39:35,520
Hold on.

4823
03:39:36,200 --> 03:39:37,360
Hold on, I'm getting dressed!

4824
03:39:38,340 --> 03:39:39,960
Let me exit out of the game too.

4825
03:39:40,380 --> 03:39:41,720
Quit to menu.

4826
03:39:43,960 --> 03:39:44,980
Quit to desktop.

4827
03:39:46,100 --> 03:39:47,360
Let's put on something chill.

4828
03:39:49,880 --> 03:39:52,100
Some music, just for a little bit.

4829
03:39:52,260 --> 03:39:54,360
Because I have some stuff I need to take care of.

4830
03:39:56,360 --> 03:39:56,800
Uh...

4831
03:39:57,500 --> 03:39:57,940
Ptptptp.

4832
03:39:59,900 --> 03:40:00,340
Uh...

4833
03:40:07,670 --> 03:40:08,670
Sorry, hold on.

4834
03:40:12,050 --> 03:40:12,810
There we go.

4835
03:40:21,250 --> 03:40:22,370
Okey dokey.

4836
03:40:23,410 --> 03:40:24,730
I'm all changed!

4837
03:40:25,490 --> 03:40:26,810
Oh, my arms.

4838
03:40:31,670 --> 03:40:32,590
My arms.

4839
03:40:36,590 --> 03:40:37,330
There we go.

4840
03:40:40,110 --> 03:40:40,690
All better.

4841
03:40:40,970 --> 03:40:41,810
Talk strings!

4842
03:40:41,990 --> 03:40:43,110
Thanks for the vibe gifted!

4843
03:40:43,370 --> 03:40:44,130
Thank you!

4844
03:40:44,390 --> 03:40:45,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4845
03:40:47,290 --> 03:40:49,430
The wisp singing karaoke is so cute.

4846
03:40:49,570 --> 03:40:50,070
I know, right?

4847
03:40:54,090 --> 03:40:55,610
Show them chicken wings!

4848
03:41:03,160 --> 03:41:04,380
Is this what you wanted?

4849
03:41:05,180 --> 03:41:06,380
Is this what you like?

4850
03:41:14,830 --> 03:41:16,190
Those two are still cooking...

4851
03:41:16,190 --> 03:41:17,270
It's Memorial Day!

4852
03:41:17,270 --> 03:41:17,390
Yay!

4853
03:41:18,110 --> 03:41:19,870
Of course they're having a barbecue.

4854
03:41:20,970 --> 03:41:21,750
Gosh, duh.

4855
03:41:24,590 --> 03:41:25,570
She's gonna take off.

4856
03:41:27,430 --> 03:41:28,550
Oh, that was so fun!

4857
03:41:28,850 --> 03:41:29,430
Oh my gosh.

4858
03:41:29,510 --> 03:41:33,590
Maybe I'll do a part two and get some other of the endings.

4859
03:41:33,670 --> 03:41:39,690
But it's like... a little daunting, I feel, to get to first... how much is in the game.

4860
03:41:39,930 --> 03:41:44,290
But I'm really happy that I could at least get the bucket.

4861
03:41:44,510 --> 03:41:46,410
At least the bucket ending was so fun.

4862
03:41:46,490 --> 03:41:47,190
I really liked that one.

4863
03:41:47,270 --> 03:41:49,610
Ducky, thanks for the vibe gift and thank you!

4864
03:41:49,870 --> 03:41:50,570
Thank you, thank you.

4865
03:41:51,150 --> 03:41:52,530
What was your favorite bit?

4866
03:41:53,610 --> 03:41:54,730
Maybe the bucket.

4867
03:41:54,890 --> 03:41:57,330
I know it's like the most recent one, but...

4868
03:41:57,330 --> 03:41:58,910
Synapse, thanks for the super chat!

4869
03:41:59,210 --> 03:42:00,250
Marsha, thanks for the super chat!

4870
03:42:04,750 --> 03:42:09,430
But I know it was like... maybe because it was like the... it felt newer.

4871
03:42:10,490 --> 03:42:16,790
But I also really liked the... because my game broke before in the hole.

4872
03:42:17,290 --> 03:42:21,130
I never got to see like all the special things that went on with it, so...

4873
03:42:21,130 --> 03:42:22,390
That was really fun too.

4874
03:42:22,890 --> 03:42:23,950
And the skip button.

4875
03:42:24,030 --> 03:42:26,250
The skip button one really makes you just kinda...

4876
03:42:26,250 --> 03:42:29,710
Has like a good... I don't want... it's not a feels good.

4877
03:42:29,950 --> 03:42:32,210
But it's like a good...

4878
03:42:33,670 --> 03:42:35,850
It makes you feel something, you know what I mean?

4879
03:42:36,350 --> 03:42:37,970
Makes you... makes you feel.

4880
03:42:39,450 --> 03:42:41,770
Oh, the bottom of the mind control room song!

4881
03:42:41,990 --> 03:42:42,230
Yes!

4882
03:42:42,550 --> 03:42:43,970
That was so good!

4883
03:42:44,210 --> 03:42:46,070
Oh my gosh, I was so happy we got that one.

4884
03:42:46,070 --> 03:42:47,210
It was really awesome.

4885
03:42:47,430 --> 03:42:48,470
It's very somber.

4886
03:42:48,750 --> 03:42:49,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4887
03:42:50,810 --> 03:42:51,390
But...

4888
03:42:52,040 --> 03:42:58,590
It's crazy how much replayability this game has, you know?

4889
03:43:00,630 --> 03:43:04,690
So, this week will be a bit of a short week.

4890
03:43:05,950 --> 03:43:08,410
I'll be streaming... I'll have a...

4891
03:43:08,410 --> 03:43:10,530
I have to still figure out what I'm streaming.

4892
03:43:11,730 --> 03:43:15,570
Because I'll be going to Off-Kai for this weekend.

4893
03:43:16,070 --> 03:43:17,630
And then from Off-Kai...

4894
03:43:19,050 --> 03:43:20,950
Matara and I will be going to...

4895
03:43:21,830 --> 03:43:22,350
To...

4896
03:43:23,010 --> 03:43:23,930
To Japan!

4897
03:43:24,670 --> 03:43:25,190
So...

4898
03:43:26,490 --> 03:43:28,810
While we're there, we're kind of gonna be like...

4899
03:43:28,810 --> 03:43:30,610
Streaming every other day.

4900
03:43:30,750 --> 03:43:33,130
So she'll stream one day and I'll stream...

4901
03:43:33,730 --> 03:43:34,810
The next day.

4902
03:43:35,870 --> 03:43:37,570
And so on and so forth.

4903
03:43:37,690 --> 03:43:38,030
So...

4904
03:43:38,650 --> 03:43:40,490
Probably won't have a schedule for that.

4905
03:43:41,650 --> 03:43:43,010
So I really apologize.

4906
03:43:43,110 --> 03:43:44,150
It's been kind of like...

4907
03:43:44,790 --> 03:43:45,310
Schedulist.

4908
03:43:45,310 --> 03:43:45,950
Even...

4909
03:43:45,950 --> 03:43:48,110
Last week and this week and...

4910
03:43:48,110 --> 03:43:50,590
I didn't mean to not have a schedule last week.

4911
03:43:52,070 --> 03:43:53,030
I think...

4912
03:43:54,190 --> 03:43:55,550
I've kind of mentioned it.

4913
03:43:56,050 --> 03:43:56,670
Well, no.

4914
03:43:56,750 --> 03:43:58,530
I mentioned... I think I've mentioned it on the Patreon thing.

4915
03:43:58,670 --> 03:44:01,130
It was funny because I saw... I would see some comments...

4916
03:44:01,130 --> 03:44:02,030
Being like...

4917
03:44:02,030 --> 03:44:02,810
I wonder if...

4918
03:44:03,090 --> 03:44:04,970
If Mint is keeping her schedule...

4919
03:44:04,970 --> 03:44:06,310
A secret because...

4920
03:44:06,310 --> 03:44:08,190
Of WrestleTuber, you know?

4921
03:44:08,210 --> 03:44:08,910
Because she's...

4922
03:44:08,910 --> 03:44:10,970
She doesn't want to spoil that she's gonna be a guest.

4923
03:44:11,310 --> 03:44:12,310
And I'll be honest...

4924
03:44:14,130 --> 03:44:14,610
Uh...

4925
03:44:14,610 --> 03:44:15,790
That was not the case.

4926
03:44:16,010 --> 03:44:16,350
I...

4927
03:44:17,410 --> 03:44:18,190
I just...

4928
03:44:18,710 --> 03:44:20,110
I just didn't put one out.

4929
03:44:22,130 --> 03:44:24,870
I just didn't want to put one out because I was...

4930
03:44:24,870 --> 03:44:26,670
Indecisive about what I wanted to do.

4931
03:44:26,790 --> 03:44:29,550
My brain has been kind of all over the place because I'm like...

4932
03:44:29,550 --> 03:44:30,810
Trying to figure out...

4933
03:44:30,810 --> 03:44:32,030
How do I...

4934
03:44:32,470 --> 03:44:33,690
Get ready for...

4935
03:44:34,430 --> 03:44:36,530
For my trips and...

4936
03:44:36,530 --> 03:44:37,210
And...

4937
03:44:37,210 --> 03:44:38,770
Planning other stuff and...

4938
03:44:39,690 --> 03:44:40,130
Contacting...

4939
03:44:40,130 --> 03:44:41,830
Sending emails and...

4940
03:44:41,830 --> 03:44:43,270
It's been a little...

4941
03:44:43,270 --> 03:44:44,490
It's been a little bit overwhelming.

4942
03:44:46,050 --> 03:44:46,610
But...

4943
03:44:48,010 --> 03:44:50,090
Thinking Mint is more clever than we thought.

4944
03:44:50,390 --> 03:44:51,710
No, actually...

4945
03:44:51,710 --> 03:44:52,010
The...

4946
03:44:53,330 --> 03:44:55,470
The WrestleTuber was pretty last minute.

4947
03:44:57,590 --> 03:44:58,150
But...

4948
03:44:58,150 --> 03:44:59,810
I'm really glad that I could participate.

4949
03:45:00,510 --> 03:45:01,610
Last night...

4950
03:45:01,610 --> 03:45:03,010
Last night...

4951
03:45:03,010 --> 03:45:04,070
Doki and I...

4952
03:45:04,070 --> 03:45:04,670
We were up...

4953
03:45:04,670 --> 03:45:06,270
I was up until like...

4954
03:45:06,270 --> 03:45:07,350
Almost 4 a.m.

4955
03:45:08,130 --> 03:45:08,690
Uh...

4956
03:45:08,690 --> 03:45:10,030
Talking with her.

4957
03:45:10,090 --> 03:45:10,990
We were catching up.

4958
03:45:12,090 --> 03:45:12,650
So...

4959
03:45:13,570 --> 03:45:14,130
Um...

4960
03:45:14,130 --> 03:45:14,470
I was really...

4961
03:45:14,470 --> 03:45:14,710
Really glad.

4962
03:45:14,930 --> 03:45:15,650
I was really happy.

4963
03:45:16,390 --> 03:45:16,950
Um...

4964
03:45:18,450 --> 03:45:18,730
Because...

4965
03:45:19,890 --> 03:45:20,450
Um...

4966
03:45:20,450 --> 03:45:21,670
I was...

4967
03:45:21,670 --> 03:45:23,150
I was...

4968
03:45:23,150 --> 03:45:24,090
Um...

4969
03:45:24,710 --> 03:45:26,910
I don't want to say too much about it.

4970
03:45:27,590 --> 03:45:28,150
Um...

4971
03:45:28,150 --> 03:45:30,790
But I was like kind of nervous about reaching out.

4972
03:45:31,310 --> 03:45:31,870
Um...

4973
03:45:31,870 --> 03:45:33,350
I mostly...

4974
03:45:33,910 --> 03:45:34,470
Uh...

4975
03:45:34,470 --> 03:45:36,010
I mostly kept my distance...

4976
03:45:36,810 --> 03:45:37,370
For...

4977
03:45:37,370 --> 03:45:39,170
A while because I...

4978
03:45:39,170 --> 03:45:40,710
Didn't want to make her uncomfortable.

4979
03:45:42,170 --> 03:45:42,730
But...

4980
03:45:42,730 --> 03:45:42,930
Um...

4981
03:45:43,890 --> 03:45:44,450
I...

4982
03:45:44,450 --> 03:45:44,770
Um...

4983
03:45:45,450 --> 03:45:46,110
Ultimately...

4984
03:45:46,110 --> 03:45:47,270
I'm glad that I did.

4985
03:45:47,630 --> 03:45:48,550
So...

4986
03:45:48,550 --> 03:45:49,450
Um...

4987
03:45:50,110 --> 03:45:50,890
So...

4988
03:45:50,890 --> 03:45:51,890
Um...

4989
03:45:51,890 --> 03:45:52,710
Yeah...

4990
03:45:53,450 --> 03:45:56,050
I had a lot of fun...

4991
03:45:56,050 --> 03:45:57,410
For WrestleTuber.

4992
03:45:57,650 --> 03:45:58,290
Um...

4993
03:45:59,710 --> 03:46:02,610
You have no idea how well the...

4994
03:46:02,610 --> 03:46:03,050
Oh...

4995
03:46:03,050 --> 03:46:05,830
The shippers are eating this week.

4996
03:46:06,090 --> 03:46:07,010
Uh...

4997
03:46:07,010 --> 03:46:07,930
Uh...

4998
03:46:07,930 --> 03:46:09,450
I'm happy...

4999
03:46:09,450 --> 03:46:10,510
For you...

5000
03:46:10,510 --> 03:46:12,310
Um...

5001
03:46:12,310 --> 03:46:12,990
Um...

5002
03:46:12,990 --> 03:46:14,330
I'm happy...

5003
03:46:14,330 --> 03:46:14,430
For you...

5004
03:46:14,450 --> 03:46:17,470
For you...?

5005
03:46:21,570 --> 03:46:22,550
But yeah...

5006
03:46:22,550 --> 03:46:23,290
Um...

5007
03:46:28,030 --> 03:46:29,730
They are eating good.

5008
03:46:33,730 --> 03:46:34,650
I'll be honest.

5009
03:46:34,790 --> 03:46:36,370
I've seen fan art.

5010
03:46:36,750 --> 03:46:38,070
There's been a lot of fan art.

5011
03:46:38,230 --> 03:46:38,610
So...

5012
03:46:40,110 --> 03:46:41,370
There's been a lot of fan art.

5013
03:46:41,450 --> 03:46:42,150
So thank you guys.

5014
03:46:42,870 --> 03:46:43,370
Um...

5015
03:46:44,590 --> 03:46:46,930
Mmm, what is bro yapping about?

5016
03:46:50,550 --> 03:46:58,350
And even Matara joining, hers was like super last minute too, so...

5017
03:46:59,190 --> 03:47:00,910
And you know, it was funny.

5018
03:47:01,030 --> 03:47:04,050
She sent me a couple of voice lines.

5019
03:47:04,250 --> 03:47:11,470
I was like, can you send me some stuff and then I'll send it over to her and to Doki and she can send it to her editor and this and that.

5020
03:47:12,810 --> 03:47:13,950
Matara was funny AF.

5021
03:47:14,130 --> 03:47:14,430
I know!

5022
03:47:15,190 --> 03:47:20,310
I wish... I hope next time she can participate in person if she wants to.

5023
03:47:20,470 --> 03:47:24,190
But I thought it was really funny that... even I felt bad.

5024
03:47:24,270 --> 03:47:25,550
I was like, you're on vacation, sorry.

5025
03:47:28,470 --> 03:47:30,790
But the editor cooked so much.

5026
03:47:31,050 --> 03:47:33,210
In such a short amount of time they did it.

5027
03:47:33,250 --> 03:47:33,750
It was so great.

5028
03:47:34,270 --> 03:47:35,610
We're happy for the both of you.

5029
03:47:35,670 --> 03:47:36,570
Thanks for sticking around.

5030
03:47:37,770 --> 03:47:38,490
Thank you!

5031
03:47:39,330 --> 03:47:39,990
Thank you.

5032
03:47:41,470 --> 03:47:45,010
I can't tell you... I can't tell you guys how much it like...

5033
03:47:45,930 --> 03:47:47,470
I... how much I...

5034
03:47:49,690 --> 03:47:50,410
What's the word?

5035
03:47:50,830 --> 03:47:52,170
Like went back and forth.

5036
03:47:53,210 --> 03:47:56,870
How much I was just like... I don't want to make her uncomfortable but...

5037
03:47:57,570 --> 03:48:00,530
I wanna... I was like I miss my friend.

5038
03:48:04,010 --> 03:48:09,070
So... and it was... it was something that was really like eating at me for a while.

5039
03:48:09,310 --> 03:48:10,990
And I was just like, I don't know.

5040
03:48:10,990 --> 03:48:12,350
I don't know how she feels about me anymore.

5041
03:48:13,330 --> 03:48:13,770
So...

5042
03:48:14,970 --> 03:48:15,410
Yeah.

5043
03:48:17,870 --> 03:48:19,250
But I'm glad it worked out.

5044
03:48:22,690 --> 03:48:26,170
Because the last thing I would want to do is make, you know, anybody feel uncomfortable.

5045
03:48:26,610 --> 03:48:27,050
So...

5046
03:48:31,830 --> 03:48:33,090
But we... we...

5047
03:48:33,090 --> 03:48:35,690
The first night that we like...

5048
03:48:36,570 --> 03:48:37,670
Caught up a little bit.

5049
03:48:37,890 --> 03:48:39,610
I was... I was up so late.

5050
03:48:39,610 --> 03:48:41,690
We were just like talking and catching up.

5051
03:48:41,950 --> 03:48:42,090
And...

5052
03:48:42,690 --> 03:48:44,170
Last night, the same thing too.

5053
03:48:44,270 --> 03:48:45,590
Afterwards, I was just like...

5054
03:48:45,590 --> 03:48:47,150
I was like, oh, she's probably so tired.

5055
03:48:47,230 --> 03:48:48,690
She probably doesn't want to like hang out too much.

5056
03:48:48,830 --> 03:48:49,010
But...

5057
03:48:49,470 --> 03:48:50,570
But then I was like...

5058
03:48:50,570 --> 03:48:52,410
I was like, girl, you need to go get some water.

5059
03:48:55,550 --> 03:48:55,910
So...

5060
03:48:59,050 --> 03:49:00,250
The geography argument.

5061
03:49:03,270 --> 03:49:04,770
I'm sure she appreciated it.

5062
03:49:04,830 --> 03:49:06,010
It was such a fun event.

5063
03:49:06,370 --> 03:49:08,050
It was great to see you guys stream together.

5064
03:49:08,310 --> 03:49:08,610
Yeah.

5065
03:49:08,610 --> 03:49:09,490
And then...

5066
03:49:09,490 --> 03:49:13,670
Afterwards, like some of the other participants messaged me as well.

5067
03:49:15,360 --> 03:49:17,290
And I was really happy about that.

5068
03:49:17,450 --> 03:49:17,810
So...

5069
03:49:18,870 --> 03:49:20,150
Maybe I can...

5070
03:49:20,150 --> 03:49:22,590
Make more friends with people.

5071
03:49:24,870 --> 03:49:25,570
Yeah.

5072
03:49:29,050 --> 03:49:29,750
But...

5073
03:49:31,870 --> 03:49:32,570
Yippee.

5074
03:49:33,790 --> 03:49:34,490
Yippee.

5075
03:49:37,050 --> 03:49:38,010
I'm resting...

5076
03:49:38,610 --> 03:49:39,090
Yeah.

5077
03:49:39,570 --> 03:49:40,970
She was so sweet.

5078
03:49:41,150 --> 03:49:42,610
After the first day...

5079
03:49:43,450 --> 03:49:45,350
She added me in the...

5080
03:49:45,350 --> 03:49:47,470
Like in the server that we were in for the event.

5081
03:49:47,570 --> 03:49:48,430
She was like...

5082
03:49:49,690 --> 03:49:50,790
She was like...

5083
03:49:52,110 --> 03:49:54,330
She was like, it was nice talking with you finally.

5084
03:49:55,970 --> 03:49:58,010
Even though it was like in this environment.

5085
03:49:59,490 --> 03:50:01,670
Canonically, who was the security guard you killed?

5086
03:50:01,930 --> 03:50:03,270
What do you mean canonically?

5087
03:50:03,270 --> 03:50:03,270
Exactly.

5088
03:50:03,570 --> 03:50:04,910
I killed several people.

5089
03:50:05,090 --> 03:50:08,490
I killed... I killed... I killed... I killed the... I killed people.

5090
03:50:09,070 --> 03:50:10,710
People were happy to see you around?

5091
03:50:10,910 --> 03:50:11,850
Who saw that coming?

5092
03:50:12,070 --> 03:50:12,750
Everyone else.

5093
03:50:12,850 --> 03:50:13,550
What do you mean?

5094
03:50:15,570 --> 03:50:16,410
What do you mean?

5095
03:50:17,970 --> 03:50:19,970
Aren't you a member of Fillion's pirate crew now?

5096
03:50:20,050 --> 03:50:20,390
I am!

5097
03:50:21,490 --> 03:50:22,490
I am, I am.

5098
03:50:22,710 --> 03:50:25,470
I remember you promised someone a collab after finishing Ghost Trick.

5099
03:50:25,830 --> 03:50:27,430
I know, I know.

5100
03:50:27,870 --> 03:50:29,890
I'm kind of... I have a lot...

5101
03:50:29,890 --> 03:50:32,070
Basically, once I get back from Japan...

5102
03:50:32,710 --> 03:50:33,950
I plan on...

5103
03:50:35,050 --> 03:50:35,530
Really...

5104
03:50:36,510 --> 03:50:37,590
Hitting the ground running.

5105
03:50:39,190 --> 03:50:41,770
I've been trying to plan stuff for my anniversary.

5106
03:50:42,310 --> 03:50:43,810
My not four year anniversary.

5107
03:50:44,110 --> 03:50:46,150
My one year anniversary.

5108
03:50:46,590 --> 03:50:47,990
I've been trying to plan stuff for that.

5109
03:50:49,850 --> 03:50:53,450
I've been trying to plan stuff for...

5110
03:50:54,950 --> 03:50:55,910
For my...

5111
03:50:57,250 --> 03:50:58,290
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

5112
03:51:01,270 --> 03:51:02,910
People love you, you dorkoid.

5113
03:51:03,010 --> 03:51:03,810
What does that mean?

5114
03:51:14,610 --> 03:51:15,450
My anniversary?

5115
03:51:18,710 --> 03:51:19,390
My anniversary?

5116
03:51:22,270 --> 03:51:22,930
Oh my god.

5117
03:51:23,150 --> 03:51:23,570
Wait!

5118
03:51:25,330 --> 03:51:26,350
Thank you for the akasoba!

5119
03:51:26,710 --> 03:51:28,150
It was so great to see you at WrestleTember.

5120
03:51:28,250 --> 03:51:28,770
I'm really glad.

5121
03:51:28,770 --> 03:51:30,330
You and Doki had a good time catching up.

5122
03:51:30,510 --> 03:51:31,270
Thank you!

5123
03:51:33,070 --> 03:51:35,690
What truly made me smile is how you two didn't seem to miss a beat.

5124
03:51:35,750 --> 03:51:38,290
Immediately into the half laughing, half screaming.

5125
03:51:40,490 --> 03:51:41,970
I guess that's just...

5126
03:51:42,530 --> 03:51:43,430
I don't know.

5127
03:51:45,490 --> 03:51:46,290
I guess...

5128
03:51:50,370 --> 03:51:51,530
I don't know how to say.

5129
03:51:52,110 --> 03:51:54,810
Maybe it is our destiny to always...

5130
03:51:54,810 --> 03:51:55,950
Or to act that way.

5131
03:51:56,210 --> 03:51:58,370
Maybe I felt compelled even though I have never...

5132
03:51:58,370 --> 03:51:59,290
Met her before.

5133
03:52:06,490 --> 03:52:07,150
But yeah.

5134
03:52:09,030 --> 03:52:11,570
I know it's shocking but so many people love...

5135
03:52:12,210 --> 03:52:12,650
Adore...

5136
03:52:12,650 --> 03:52:13,210
And support you.

5137
03:52:13,250 --> 03:52:13,730
You are amazing.

5138
03:52:15,270 --> 03:52:16,810
I got home from Paname.

5139
03:52:16,890 --> 03:52:18,130
I saw a lot of fan words of you.

5140
03:52:18,390 --> 03:52:19,550
See you at Afkai hopefully!

5141
03:52:20,190 --> 03:52:20,910
See you!

5142
03:52:25,190 --> 03:52:27,690
I've been told dorkoid is the yellow one.

5143
03:52:27,690 --> 03:52:28,030
Regardless.

5144
03:52:28,430 --> 03:52:29,130
We love you, Mito.

5145
03:52:29,390 --> 03:52:31,070
What I mean by that is we love you.

5146
03:52:31,950 --> 03:52:32,470
Stop!

5147
03:52:34,870 --> 03:52:35,390
Stop!

5148
03:52:41,190 --> 03:52:41,710
Dorkoid.

5149
03:52:42,270 --> 03:52:42,790
Dorkoid!

5150
03:52:47,210 --> 03:52:47,730
But...

5151
03:52:51,050 --> 03:52:53,030
I love the part when Doki...

5152
03:52:53,490 --> 03:52:55,570
Accidentally called herself small brain and you were like...

5153
03:52:55,570 --> 03:52:55,830
Yep.

5154
03:52:58,570 --> 03:53:00,110
She's a bird after all.

5155
03:53:00,530 --> 03:53:01,290
You know?

5156
03:53:02,810 --> 03:53:04,230
She's a bird after all.

5157
03:53:04,450 --> 03:53:19,520
I think You-san's entrance was so...

5158
03:53:19,520 --> 03:53:21,900
I didn't even know that was gonna happen.

5159
03:53:23,440 --> 03:53:24,000
So...

5160
03:53:24,860 --> 03:53:25,960
I didn't...

5161
03:53:25,960 --> 03:53:28,640
That was my first time seeing that, too.

5162
03:53:29,320 --> 03:53:29,880
So...

5163
03:53:30,360 --> 03:53:33,700
It was really... really something.

5164
03:53:35,820 --> 03:53:38,140
Will you let us know when you get in the robot at Ofukai?

5165
03:53:38,340 --> 03:53:40,140
I didn't get a meet and greet but still want to meet you.

5166
03:53:40,260 --> 03:53:43,960
I think that's still being planned.

5167
03:53:44,680 --> 03:53:48,040
But once I know anything, I know it's like kind of last minute.

5168
03:53:48,740 --> 03:53:50,200
Because Ofukai is this weekend!

5169
03:53:50,580 --> 03:53:51,280
Oh my gosh!

5170
03:53:51,340 --> 03:53:52,640
Ofukai is this weekend, you guys!

5171
03:53:53,100 --> 03:53:53,760
Oh my gosh!

5172
03:53:54,220 --> 03:53:57,580
But I will let you guys know as soon as I know.

5173
03:53:59,880 --> 03:54:01,520
Because I don't know what.

5174
03:54:01,720 --> 03:54:02,860
Thanks for being at the truck event.

5175
03:54:03,080 --> 03:54:03,800
Thank you!

5176
03:54:05,320 --> 03:54:07,000
Yeah, the truck event was really fun too.

5177
03:54:08,300 --> 03:54:09,900
Everybody was super duper hype.

5178
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:11,040
And...

5179
03:54:15,400 --> 03:54:15,880
And...

5180
03:54:20,000 --> 03:54:21,380
There were so many people.

5181
03:54:21,520 --> 03:54:22,920
I was really shocked.

5182
03:54:23,120 --> 03:54:27,160
Actually, right before I went on, I was like messaging my friend.

5183
03:54:27,360 --> 03:54:28,360
Because she was there.

5184
03:54:28,500 --> 03:54:29,120
And I was like...

5185
03:54:29,980 --> 03:54:33,000
They kind of sandwiched me between two DJs.

5186
03:54:33,860 --> 03:54:35,940
I'm going to bring the mood down so much.

5187
03:54:36,080 --> 03:54:37,700
Because I'm like not a DJ.

5188
03:54:37,860 --> 03:54:39,240
It's not like continuous music.

5189
03:54:39,420 --> 03:54:41,020
Like I'm going to be singing.

5190
03:54:41,200 --> 03:54:42,480
And it's going to be weird.

5191
03:54:42,640 --> 03:54:43,100
And she was like...

5192
03:54:43,100 --> 03:54:43,940
No, it will be fine.

5193
03:54:45,560 --> 03:54:46,480
You'll just...

5194
03:54:46,480 --> 03:54:47,820
You'll have a lot of fun.

5195
03:54:48,260 --> 03:54:51,040
So I was really, really actually quite nervous about it.

5196
03:54:51,780 --> 03:54:52,240
And...

5197
03:54:54,320 --> 03:54:55,940
Possible block game adventure collab.

5198
03:54:56,400 --> 03:54:57,940
With who?

5199
03:54:58,060 --> 03:54:58,340
Doki?

5200
03:54:59,400 --> 03:54:59,800
Maybe.

5201
03:55:03,680 --> 03:55:05,340
I don't really know how I can...

5202
03:55:05,340 --> 03:55:06,940
How I can feel more proud.

5203
03:55:07,080 --> 03:55:08,440
Thank you for existing the way you are.

5204
03:55:08,460 --> 03:55:09,040
But don't stop.

5205
03:55:11,560 --> 03:55:12,340
Thank you.

5206
03:55:17,200 --> 03:55:19,520
I'm so happy you chose to reach out.

5207
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:20,960
You two interacting and speak content.

5208
03:55:21,100 --> 03:55:23,760
And she could use a friend who can call her out on her shit.

5209
03:55:26,820 --> 03:55:27,220
Yeah.

5210
03:55:27,980 --> 03:55:29,340
She calls me out.

5211
03:55:29,400 --> 03:55:30,520
We call out each other.

5212
03:55:30,720 --> 03:55:31,400
I feel...

5213
03:55:31,400 --> 03:55:33,380
I actually think I get dumber around her.

5214
03:55:35,720 --> 03:55:37,600
I actually think I'm like...

5215
03:55:37,600 --> 03:55:39,560
I'm physically stupid.

5216
03:55:39,880 --> 03:55:41,560
More stupid when she's around.

5217
03:55:46,080 --> 03:55:47,420
Our September was awesome.

5218
03:55:47,480 --> 03:55:48,360
It's so great to hear you.

5219
03:55:48,400 --> 03:55:51,240
Doki had time outside of the event to hang.

5220
03:55:51,420 --> 03:55:52,060
Thanks for sharing.

5221
03:55:52,100 --> 03:55:54,260
It means a lot to us parasocial weirdos.

5222
03:55:54,540 --> 03:55:55,420
We love you guys.

5223
03:55:55,500 --> 03:55:56,320
You deserve the best.

5224
03:55:56,320 --> 03:55:56,600
It's been...

5225
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:57,160
Thank you.

5226
03:55:57,640 --> 03:55:58,520
Thank you.

5227
03:56:02,960 --> 03:56:05,160
Brain cell sharing is real.

5228
03:56:08,900 --> 03:56:09,860
Oh my gosh.

5229
03:56:09,940 --> 03:56:11,920
Rice Nat and Orca right next to each other.

5230
03:56:12,180 --> 03:56:13,200
Please stop.

5231
03:56:14,400 --> 03:56:15,000
Stop.

5232
03:56:18,580 --> 03:56:20,360
What was I going to say though?

5233
03:56:20,800 --> 03:56:21,140
Um...

5234
03:56:22,300 --> 03:56:22,900
Um...

5235
03:56:24,280 --> 03:56:24,580
Um...

5236
03:56:25,700 --> 03:56:26,300
Um...

5237
03:56:34,280 --> 03:56:36,040
I can't help what I see.

5238
03:56:36,160 --> 03:56:38,200
I can't help what pops up on my Twitter.

5239
03:56:38,420 --> 03:56:38,720
You know?

5240
03:56:39,040 --> 03:56:40,420
I can't help it.

5241
03:56:40,880 --> 03:56:42,280
Good to see you at the truck.

5242
03:56:42,400 --> 03:56:42,920
Thank you.

5243
03:56:43,360 --> 03:56:44,000
But yeah.

5244
03:56:44,380 --> 03:56:46,160
So I was really nervous for the truck.

5245
03:56:46,240 --> 03:56:48,780
And then in the end, everybody was...

5246
03:56:48,780 --> 03:56:50,300
The energy was so there.

5247
03:56:51,580 --> 03:56:52,800
People were lifting.

5248
03:56:53,340 --> 03:56:54,800
There was Kujaku.

5249
03:56:54,980 --> 03:56:55,900
There was...

5250
03:56:55,900 --> 03:56:56,280
Sorry.

5251
03:56:56,280 --> 03:56:57,480
There was so much going on.

5252
03:56:57,540 --> 03:56:58,640
It was a lot, a lot of fun.

5253
03:56:58,900 --> 03:57:00,220
And people...

5254
03:57:00,220 --> 03:57:01,520
There were people on top of cars.

5255
03:57:01,960 --> 03:57:03,200
On top of trucks watching.

5256
03:57:03,820 --> 03:57:05,200
We love Anikura.

5257
03:57:06,060 --> 03:57:07,020
Anikura Saiko!

5258
03:57:09,460 --> 03:57:11,360
Your sweater has been so good.

5259
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:18,000
Oh, they built a fire pit out of glow sticks.

5260
03:57:18,180 --> 03:57:18,380
Yeah.

5261
03:57:18,460 --> 03:57:20,080
If anybody went to...

5262
03:57:21,220 --> 03:57:21,700
To...

5263
03:57:23,500 --> 03:57:24,300
See me.

5264
03:57:24,420 --> 03:57:26,260
And I've never been to Anikura...

5265
03:57:28,020 --> 03:57:53,500
I hope that you got a little bit of a taste of why I love idols so much and idols and like, you know, doing calls and just stuff like that like it's just such a fun energy that that truly only can be felt in that kind of that kind of place.

5266
03:57:57,400 --> 03:57:59,200
Oh, so fun though.

5267
03:57:59,380 --> 03:58:00,880
I felt so happy.

5268
03:58:00,960 --> 03:58:06,060
I just felt so fulfilled on on on Saturday.

5269
03:58:06,280 --> 03:58:08,560
It was honestly just this weekend.

5270
03:58:08,840 --> 03:58:09,980
This past weekend.

5271
03:58:10,120 --> 03:58:11,400
I felt so fulfilled.

5272
03:58:11,720 --> 03:58:21,260
I felt really I probably felt the happiest I have in in in quite a while.

5273
03:58:21,580 --> 03:58:25,780
So I'm really happy.

5274
03:58:28,920 --> 03:58:33,460
I wish I could have gone to the truck event even though it was a drive away, but WrestleTuber was wild.

5275
03:58:33,560 --> 03:58:36,080
Glad you had fun and hope you have fun in JP too.

5276
03:58:36,280 --> 03:58:37,140
Thank you, Jay.

5277
03:58:37,520 --> 03:58:38,160
Thank you for the welcome.

5278
03:58:38,260 --> 03:58:39,260
Thank you so much.

5279
03:58:39,520 --> 03:58:40,180
Thank you.

5280
03:58:43,520 --> 03:58:48,000
There's still things that I'm trying to catch up on.

5281
03:58:49,580 --> 03:58:53,940
Some things I feel like I still feel.

5282
03:58:54,540 --> 03:58:56,180
I still feel really nervous about.

5283
03:58:58,100 --> 03:59:10,940
Uncertain, I guess maybe is a better word because I feel sort of like how does how do I say this?

5284
03:59:11,220 --> 03:59:13,500
How do I say this without being weird?

5285
03:59:14,760 --> 03:59:15,720
Everything's weird, though.

5286
03:59:16,720 --> 03:59:22,700
I feel I think basically I don't know how to say it.

5287
03:59:23,140 --> 03:59:24,540
Sorry, I'm not very articulate.

5288
03:59:25,540 --> 03:59:26,020
Sorry, I'm not very articulate.

5289
03:59:28,580 --> 03:59:29,660
Step by step.

5290
03:59:29,820 --> 03:59:31,820
I guess that's mainly it.

5291
03:59:32,760 --> 03:59:40,740
I'm just trying to take things step by step, but I'm trying not to lose out.

5292
03:59:41,600 --> 03:59:47,760
I'm trying not to be so passive that I lose out on opportunities.

5293
03:59:49,720 --> 03:59:50,900
It's kind of it's hard.

5294
03:59:51,000 --> 03:59:51,440
It's hard.

5295
03:59:52,200 --> 03:59:53,540
It's hard going from.

5296
03:59:55,200 --> 03:59:58,320
Going from a place that took care of everything for you.

5297
04:00:00,680 --> 04:00:09,480
To having to do everything on my own and, you know, not knowing at all what to do or how to do anything.

5298
04:00:09,760 --> 04:00:11,080
Being by myself.

5299
04:00:14,100 --> 04:00:14,700
So.

5300
04:00:19,120 --> 04:00:19,720
Oh.

5301
04:00:21,360 --> 04:00:21,840
Sorry.

5302
04:00:24,480 --> 04:00:31,540
I'm biting my tongue a little bit here, but it's a big adjustment.

5303
04:00:31,680 --> 04:00:32,160
I bet.

5304
04:00:32,400 --> 04:00:32,720
Yeah.

5305
04:00:32,900 --> 04:00:33,380
So.

5306
04:00:33,960 --> 04:00:34,440
Hmm.

5307
04:00:36,820 --> 04:00:44,160
But hopefully, hopefully I can get things moving, especially once I get back from Japan.

5308
04:00:44,280 --> 04:00:46,580
Hopefully I can get things moving forward.

5309
04:00:46,760 --> 04:00:49,300
And, you know, moving forward means.

5310
04:00:50,540 --> 04:00:54,560
Not only just more opportunities for me, but then also more things for you guys as well.

5311
04:00:54,660 --> 04:00:55,000
Because.

5312
04:00:56,800 --> 04:00:58,880
Thank you for not becoming a grocer.

5313
04:01:01,920 --> 04:01:02,360
Stop.

5314
04:01:02,680 --> 04:01:04,260
Why do you guys always bring up that?

5315
04:01:05,320 --> 04:01:07,040
Why do you guys always bring that up?

5316
04:01:07,780 --> 04:01:08,660
Oh, my gosh.

5317
04:01:08,920 --> 04:01:09,780
We believe in you.

5318
04:01:09,880 --> 04:01:10,460
Thank you.

5319
04:01:11,540 --> 04:01:11,980
Yeah.

5320
04:01:17,570 --> 04:01:18,910
It's okay to be weird.

5321
04:01:20,070 --> 04:01:20,510
Weirdroid.

5322
04:01:20,850 --> 04:01:21,930
What does that mean?

5323
04:01:24,950 --> 04:01:25,470
Oh.

5324
04:01:27,010 --> 04:01:27,530
But.

5325
04:01:29,770 --> 04:01:32,630
It's because it's so upsetting you even thought about it.

5326
04:01:33,770 --> 04:01:36,270
It's surreal to think it was a possibility.

5327
04:01:37,170 --> 04:01:39,090
Because it's such a shocking thing to hear.

5328
04:01:39,250 --> 04:01:39,650
What?

5329
04:01:40,670 --> 04:01:41,810
What do you mean?

5330
04:01:42,250 --> 04:01:43,050
Oh, my gosh.

5331
04:01:43,170 --> 04:01:44,590
Thank you for the Akasupa.

5332
04:01:45,510 --> 04:01:46,590
I'd like that.

5333
04:01:46,810 --> 04:01:47,010
Wait.

5334
04:01:47,070 --> 04:01:47,550
Like what?

5335
04:01:47,930 --> 04:01:49,230
Me to become a grocer?

5336
04:01:49,490 --> 04:01:49,790
Yeah.

5337
04:01:49,910 --> 04:01:50,430
Yeah.

5338
04:01:50,550 --> 04:01:51,070
Yeah.

5339
04:01:51,390 --> 04:01:51,910
Yeah.

5340
04:01:53,570 --> 04:01:55,910
This is the Akasupa telling me to quit?

5341
04:02:05,410 --> 04:02:08,590
If you became a grocer, I would buy food every day.

5342
04:02:08,670 --> 04:02:09,110
Stop.

5343
04:02:11,750 --> 04:02:12,930
I would just be...

5344
04:02:13,510 --> 04:02:15,930
I would just be back as a normal ghost.

5345
04:02:16,150 --> 04:02:16,430
You know?

5346
04:02:17,070 --> 04:02:17,690
Don't worry.

5347
04:02:17,750 --> 04:02:19,350
I'd avoid the self-checkout for you.

5348
04:02:19,870 --> 04:02:20,350
No.

5349
04:02:21,110 --> 04:02:21,590
Oh.

5350
04:02:27,270 --> 04:02:27,730
That's so sweet.

5351
04:02:27,730 --> 04:02:28,350
Yeah, but...

5352
04:02:31,630 --> 04:02:32,370
I don't know.

5353
04:02:32,450 --> 04:02:32,910
Maybe I'll...

5354
04:02:32,910 --> 04:02:38,730
I was gonna say maybe I'll do it in my free time, but I don't have much free time anymore, really.

5355
04:02:39,690 --> 04:02:40,150
Hmm.

5356
04:02:43,770 --> 04:02:45,410
Kater, thanks for the super chat.

5357
04:02:46,210 --> 04:02:48,530
You're weird, so don't mind being weird.

5358
04:02:50,030 --> 04:02:51,430
You know what I call my cat?

5359
04:02:52,610 --> 04:02:53,410
When he is bored, I call him Kater.

5360
04:02:58,030 --> 04:03:00,830
I don't know why I say it like that.

5361
04:03:00,870 --> 04:03:03,550
You know when you talk to animals and like your vocabulary breaks?

5362
04:03:03,810 --> 04:03:04,890
It's like when you talk to babies.

5363
04:03:06,670 --> 04:03:08,990
Why sell the mint when you can be the mint?

5364
04:03:11,730 --> 04:03:13,570
Johnny, thank you for the 10 gifted!

5365
04:03:13,670 --> 04:03:14,350
Thank you so much!

5366
04:03:17,670 --> 04:03:19,130
Does Pies ever act weird?

5367
04:03:19,230 --> 04:03:20,470
Oh, all the time.

5368
04:03:20,470 --> 04:03:22,550
She is also weird though.

5369
04:03:22,710 --> 04:03:24,370
She is so weird.

5370
04:03:29,330 --> 04:03:33,710
Imagine if your idol was she retired and you bumped into her at the register of your local 7-Eleven.

5371
04:03:33,750 --> 04:03:34,930
It's crazy you almost did that.

5372
04:03:35,130 --> 04:03:36,250
I mean that happens though.

5373
04:03:37,690 --> 04:03:39,690
There was one AKB48 member.

5374
04:03:40,630 --> 04:03:42,330
She quit when she graduated.

5375
04:03:42,530 --> 04:03:43,690
I don't know if she...

5376
04:03:44,150 --> 04:03:45,650
I don't know if she...

5377
04:03:47,930 --> 04:03:49,030
Opened the ramen place.

5378
04:03:49,090 --> 04:03:50,450
But she like started working at a ramen place.

5379
04:03:50,470 --> 04:03:50,950
Opened the ramen place.

5380
04:03:51,150 --> 04:03:51,450
But she like started working at a ramen place.

5381
04:03:52,210 --> 04:03:53,090
Weird stuff.

5382
04:03:53,190 --> 04:03:53,330
You!

5383
04:03:53,910 --> 04:03:54,350
You!

5384
04:03:57,510 --> 04:04:01,070
My friend really wishes to meet you at Afkai Expo but sold out instantly.

5385
04:04:01,590 --> 04:04:02,270
Sold out?

5386
04:04:04,770 --> 04:04:05,990
I thought it was a lottery.

5387
04:04:07,430 --> 04:04:09,890
I hope to see you there though at your panel.

5388
04:04:10,330 --> 04:04:11,430
I love you so much.

5389
04:04:11,450 --> 04:04:13,110
Can't wait for us to see you at Afkai.

5390
04:04:13,330 --> 04:04:13,950
Thank you!

5391
04:04:13,970 --> 04:04:14,270
Fantastic!

5392
04:04:14,690 --> 04:04:15,170
Thank you!

5393
04:04:16,250 --> 04:04:16,810
Thank you!

5394
04:04:16,830 --> 04:04:17,130
Thank you!

5395
04:04:22,230 --> 04:04:22,770
It is a lottery.

5396
04:04:24,490 --> 04:04:26,550
It was and then there was a sale of leftovers.

5397
04:04:31,450 --> 04:04:34,090
Who applied and then didn't want to come see me?

5398
04:04:37,350 --> 04:04:39,390
But it got taken up instantly.

5399
04:04:39,590 --> 04:04:42,230
I had no idea that there was going to be an open ticket sale.

5400
04:04:42,830 --> 04:04:43,270
Really?

5401
04:04:44,230 --> 04:04:45,430
Oh, I had no idea.

5402
04:04:45,610 --> 04:04:46,810
I thought it was only a lottery.

5403
04:04:48,250 --> 04:04:49,130
Pastel Sonico!

5404
04:04:50,470 --> 04:04:51,490
Sending love, man.

5405
04:04:51,530 --> 04:04:52,150
Thank you!

5406
04:04:54,690 --> 04:04:55,290
Thank you!

5407
04:04:55,310 --> 04:04:55,750
Thank you!

5408
04:04:57,310 --> 04:04:58,810
You're my favorite weirds, dude.

5409
04:05:00,550 --> 04:05:01,250
Thanks, Nexy.

5410
04:05:01,830 --> 04:05:04,050
What a crazy person that could have been us.

5411
04:05:06,570 --> 04:05:08,090
Yeah, that could have been me.

5412
04:05:09,590 --> 04:05:10,650
That could have been me.

5413
04:05:14,170 --> 04:05:15,650
You'll never guess who won it.

5414
04:05:15,770 --> 04:05:16,610
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

5415
04:05:18,870 --> 04:05:20,210
There was only one left?

5416
04:05:20,410 --> 04:05:21,890
There was only one left?

5417
04:05:21,890 --> 04:05:22,870
What?

5418
04:05:23,970 --> 04:05:25,150
Actually, just one?

5419
04:05:32,770 --> 04:05:34,170
Someone had to cancel.

5420
04:05:37,690 --> 04:05:38,530
That's crazy.

5421
04:05:38,890 --> 04:05:39,750
That only...

5422
04:05:40,610 --> 04:05:42,430
The one piece.

5423
04:05:44,810 --> 04:05:47,530
That's insane that there was just like...

5424
04:05:47,530 --> 04:05:51,430
The one person canceled and then the one opened up.

5425
04:05:51,470 --> 04:05:52,210
That's so funny.

5426
04:05:53,640 --> 04:05:54,270
Oh my gosh.

5427
04:05:54,570 --> 04:05:55,710
Are you guys okay?

5428
04:05:56,010 --> 04:05:57,390
Trying to get the one?

5429
04:06:01,890 --> 04:06:03,150
I'm excited, though.

5430
04:06:03,170 --> 04:06:03,790
I'm so excited.

5431
04:06:04,030 --> 04:06:04,950
My first convention?

5432
04:06:05,190 --> 04:06:05,850
Oh my god.

5433
04:06:09,890 --> 04:06:10,950
Oh my gosh.

5434
04:06:11,070 --> 04:06:13,430
It's going to be a busy, busy, busy weekend, though.

5435
04:06:13,930 --> 04:06:15,630
You're a super...

5436
04:06:16,530 --> 04:06:17,410
Chu gotcha.

5437
04:06:18,210 --> 04:06:18,650
Sorry.

5438
04:06:20,350 --> 04:06:21,230
No win.

5439
04:06:25,570 --> 04:06:26,510
Sorry, David.

5440
04:06:26,670 --> 04:06:27,370
I just saw your thing.

5441
04:06:27,370 --> 04:06:28,370
Your don't know, too.

5442
04:06:28,650 --> 04:06:32,770
I haven't been here long, but as I see it, you have always been loved.

5443
04:06:32,830 --> 04:06:35,070
As an indie that's active for less than a year...

5444
04:06:36,190 --> 04:06:42,370
As an indie that's active for less than a year, you had more wiki entries than some much bigger VTubers.

5445
04:06:43,970 --> 04:06:45,990
Wiki, wiki, wiki, wiki entries.

5446
04:06:49,350 --> 04:06:50,590
So happy I became a member.

5447
04:06:50,830 --> 04:06:51,630
Here's to the future.

5448
04:06:51,710 --> 04:06:52,190
Thank you.

5449
04:06:53,350 --> 04:06:54,250
Thank you, thank you.

5450
04:06:56,290 --> 04:06:56,810
Thank you.

5451
04:06:56,810 --> 04:06:57,230
Wiki, wiki.

5452
04:06:58,070 --> 04:06:58,890
Wiki, wiki.

5453
04:06:59,070 --> 04:06:59,370
Wait.

5454
04:06:59,810 --> 04:07:00,710
Wiki entries.

5455
04:07:06,300 --> 04:07:07,080
Wiki entries.

5456
04:07:07,240 --> 04:07:07,960
Like a Wikipedia?

5457
04:07:09,780 --> 04:07:12,320
Like a... There's the VTuber wiki, though, right?

5458
04:07:16,140 --> 04:07:17,180
Thank you.

5459
04:07:17,240 --> 04:07:19,160
Thank you for whoever's updating that.

5460
04:07:20,180 --> 04:07:20,980
I suppose.

5461
04:07:23,460 --> 04:07:26,140
Probably hadn't been updated in a really long time.

5462
04:07:27,620 --> 04:07:29,340
Good luck reaching out to new people.

5463
04:07:29,440 --> 04:07:31,460
I know it can be hard sometimes, but I know you can do it.

5464
04:07:31,480 --> 04:07:32,220
Have a good night.

5465
04:07:32,260 --> 04:07:32,800
Thanks, Merlin!

5466
04:07:33,120 --> 04:07:34,760
Oh yeah, it's pretty late now, isn't it?

5467
04:07:37,020 --> 04:07:43,960
If you guys had the day off, maybe people in the United States, then I hope you had a good day off.

5468
04:07:44,100 --> 04:07:45,060
The feet wiki.

5469
04:07:45,760 --> 04:07:46,800
Shut up, Cole.

5470
04:07:48,140 --> 04:07:48,900
What are you at?

5471
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:50,380
I saw the figure you made!

5472
04:07:51,140 --> 04:07:52,520
It looks so good!

5473
04:07:52,860 --> 04:07:54,160
It looks so good!

5474
04:07:55,340 --> 04:07:57,780
But don't put it on the feet wiki, please!

5475
04:08:01,280 --> 04:08:02,720
It looks so awesome.

5476
04:08:03,240 --> 04:08:04,720
Thank you for making it.

5477
04:08:07,060 --> 04:08:07,540
CD?

5478
04:08:08,220 --> 04:08:09,300
Is that how you say your name?

5479
04:08:10,180 --> 04:08:10,660
Sedai.

5480
04:08:12,020 --> 04:08:12,900
Welcome to membership.

5481
04:08:12,940 --> 04:08:13,540
Thank you.

5482
04:08:15,720 --> 04:08:18,860
The crazy thing about the VTuber wiki is that anyone can edit it.

5483
04:08:19,640 --> 04:08:20,500
Even me?

5484
04:08:21,420 --> 04:08:22,900
I'm gonna go edit my own wiki.

5485
04:08:25,600 --> 04:08:28,100
I'm just gonna copy and paste the Metal Gear wiki.

5486
04:08:28,780 --> 04:08:32,120
I'm gonna copy and paste the synopsis of Metal Gear Solid.

5487
04:08:32,220 --> 04:08:33,240
I'm gonna replace by it.

5488
04:08:33,300 --> 04:08:33,760
Don't do that.

5489
04:08:33,960 --> 04:08:39,420
There's probably some people that would be so upset if you just erased all their hard work.

5490
04:08:42,640 --> 04:08:43,600
And then...

5491
04:08:45,020 --> 04:08:45,880
And then...

5492
04:08:45,880 --> 04:08:47,040
And then they're like...

5493
04:08:47,040 --> 04:08:48,160
They come back, they're just like...

5494
04:08:48,160 --> 04:08:50,640
Oh, something else happened with Mint Phantom.

5495
04:08:50,960 --> 04:08:51,680
I'm gonna...

5496
04:08:51,680 --> 04:08:53,320
I'm gonna update her wiki.

5497
04:08:53,320 --> 04:08:54,920
And it's all gone.

5498
04:08:55,460 --> 04:09:00,080
And replaced by Metal Gear Synopsis.

5499
04:09:04,710 --> 04:09:06,030
Don't get banned.

5500
04:09:06,490 --> 04:09:07,630
Would I get banned for that?

5501
04:09:07,710 --> 04:09:08,470
It's my own wiki.

5502
04:09:08,650 --> 04:09:10,630
This is the information that people need to read.

5503
04:09:10,750 --> 04:09:11,010
Okay?

5504
04:09:11,250 --> 04:09:12,230
This is the information.

5505
04:09:13,410 --> 04:09:15,710
May I ask how is the stinkiest boy doing?

5506
04:09:16,210 --> 04:09:17,430
Thanks for asking, Sham.

5507
04:09:19,070 --> 04:09:20,230
Andrejko, thanks for the 10 gifted!

5508
04:09:22,250 --> 04:09:23,210
I forgot.

5509
04:09:23,310 --> 04:09:23,790
Wait, hold on.

5510
04:09:23,790 --> 04:09:27,390
I forgot if you mentioned this before, but do you accept snacks as gifts of Kai?

5511
04:09:30,090 --> 04:09:31,050
Sealed snacks...

5512
04:09:31,630 --> 04:09:32,110
I...

5513
04:09:32,650 --> 04:09:32,890
Probably.

5514
04:09:33,710 --> 04:09:35,890
I think it's technically said no food.

5515
04:09:37,410 --> 04:09:38,570
But I kind of...

5516
04:09:38,570 --> 04:09:39,870
I don't really mind.

5517
04:09:40,150 --> 04:09:40,650
I mean...

5518
04:09:40,650 --> 04:09:41,170
I don't know.

5519
04:09:44,890 --> 04:09:47,130
You can fill the page with all new mint lore.

5520
04:09:49,990 --> 04:09:50,470
But...

5521
04:09:50,470 --> 04:09:50,590
Um...

5522
04:09:52,230 --> 04:09:52,750
Um...

5523
04:09:52,750 --> 04:09:53,350
Um...

5524
04:09:56,730 --> 04:09:57,250
Butaro!

5525
04:09:57,350 --> 04:09:57,670
Butaro!

5526
04:09:57,750 --> 04:09:58,030
Butaro!

5527
04:09:58,110 --> 04:09:58,370
Butaro!

5528
04:09:58,930 --> 04:09:59,450
He...

5529
04:09:59,450 --> 04:10:01,570
He's been acting a little weird lately.

5530
04:10:02,110 --> 04:10:02,630
Um...

5531
04:10:02,630 --> 04:10:03,810
Lately he's been like just...

5532
04:10:04,410 --> 04:10:04,930
Um...

5533
04:10:04,930 --> 04:10:07,390
Very much like hanging out under the bed.

5534
04:10:09,110 --> 04:10:10,650
And I can't get him out.

5535
04:10:10,870 --> 04:10:12,290
Like he'll eat...

5536
04:10:12,730 --> 04:10:14,370
But he just doesn't hang out with me.

5537
04:10:14,430 --> 04:10:17,990
I think he is in this weird adjustment with...

5538
04:10:18,570 --> 04:10:19,090
Um...

5539
04:10:19,730 --> 04:10:20,410
With Paz.

5540
04:10:20,830 --> 04:10:22,030
And that like...

5541
04:10:22,030 --> 04:10:24,490
Paz started sleeping in the bed just a little bit.

5542
04:10:24,830 --> 04:10:28,330
And I think it's made him a little self-conscious or...

5543
04:10:28,330 --> 04:10:28,910
Not self-conscious.

5544
04:10:29,030 --> 04:10:29,570
A little...

5545
04:10:30,190 --> 04:10:30,710
Um...

5546
04:10:32,570 --> 04:10:33,090
Worried?

5547
04:10:33,130 --> 04:10:34,490
Like maybe it's like his...

5548
04:10:34,490 --> 04:10:36,610
His personal space is getting taken over.

5549
04:10:38,790 --> 04:10:39,310
So...

5550
04:10:39,850 --> 04:10:41,130
How old is he?

5551
04:10:41,250 --> 04:10:42,050
He's pretty old.

5552
04:10:42,390 --> 04:10:44,130
But he's still very active.

5553
04:10:44,370 --> 04:10:45,490
Like he's still running around.

5554
04:10:45,810 --> 04:10:46,650
Like they play together.

5555
04:10:47,010 --> 04:10:47,330
So...

5556
04:10:47,330 --> 04:10:50,050
But then he just kind of goes and retreats under the bed.

5557
04:10:50,630 --> 04:10:51,150
Yeah.

5558
04:10:51,150 --> 04:10:52,240
He's very territorial.

5559
04:10:53,010 --> 04:10:54,570
He's super duper territorial.

5560
04:10:55,510 --> 04:10:56,050
So...

5561
04:10:56,050 --> 04:10:56,170
Um...

5562
04:10:58,390 --> 04:10:58,930
Uh...

5563
04:10:59,850 --> 04:11:00,390
But...

5564
04:11:01,750 --> 04:11:03,990
He's sour about having an interloper.

5565
04:11:04,330 --> 04:11:04,870
Yeah.

5566
04:11:04,910 --> 04:11:05,370
Which is...

5567
04:11:05,370 --> 04:11:07,350
I thought it was weird because...

5568
04:11:07,350 --> 04:11:08,130
Um...

5569
04:11:08,130 --> 04:11:09,730
It's been over a month now.

5570
04:11:10,530 --> 04:11:11,070
But...

5571
04:11:11,070 --> 04:11:11,950
Um...

5572
04:11:11,950 --> 04:11:12,770
I think because...

5573
04:11:12,770 --> 04:11:13,230
It only...

5574
04:11:13,230 --> 04:11:17,590
He only started acting this way once she started sleeping in the bed with me.

5575
04:11:18,090 --> 04:11:18,630
So...

5576
04:11:18,630 --> 04:11:20,410
I think he was just like...

5577
04:11:20,410 --> 04:11:20,670
Whoa.

5578
04:11:20,710 --> 04:11:20,910
Whoa.

5579
04:11:20,910 --> 04:11:21,130
Whoa.

5580
04:11:21,130 --> 04:11:22,530
I'm fine with her being around.

5581
04:11:22,710 --> 04:11:23,950
But in the bed?

5582
04:11:24,890 --> 04:11:25,270
Um...

5583
04:11:25,270 --> 04:11:26,670
That is my spot.

5584
04:11:28,030 --> 04:11:30,630
I won't be able to harvest any in time for Afkai.

5585
04:11:30,790 --> 04:11:31,390
But I think...

5586
04:11:31,390 --> 04:11:34,390
If I can get some honey from my beehives...

5587
04:11:34,390 --> 04:11:35,410
Would she want some?

5588
04:11:35,430 --> 04:11:36,890
Technically, it's food and not sealed.

5589
04:11:36,930 --> 04:11:37,870
No judgment if not.

5590
04:11:38,230 --> 04:11:39,410
Oh, morning dew.

5591
04:11:39,470 --> 04:11:40,910
That sounds so awesome.

5592
04:11:41,310 --> 04:11:44,250
But honestly, I also worry about traveling with it.

5593
04:11:45,410 --> 04:11:45,930
Um...

5594
04:11:45,930 --> 04:11:49,510
And I'm afraid that maybe even staff would reject it.

5595
04:11:49,790 --> 04:11:50,310
Um...

5596
04:11:50,310 --> 04:11:50,950
So...

5597
04:11:50,950 --> 04:11:51,110
I don't know.

5598
04:11:51,750 --> 04:11:52,790
I'm so sorry.

5599
04:11:53,090 --> 04:11:53,950
I hope that sounds...

5600
04:11:53,950 --> 04:11:55,170
I would love your honey.

5601
04:11:56,350 --> 04:11:58,010
I want to get fresh honey.

5602
04:12:02,710 --> 04:12:04,090
I recently got a new cat.

5603
04:12:04,150 --> 04:12:07,970
And my old cat has been worried about giving her cuddles to make sure she remembers she's not being replaced.

5604
04:12:08,210 --> 04:12:08,530
Yeah.

5605
04:12:08,590 --> 04:12:10,270
I've been trying to do that a lot with him.

5606
04:12:10,370 --> 04:12:11,070
So I'm like...

5607
04:12:11,070 --> 04:12:12,470
I'm just like...

5608
04:12:14,730 --> 04:12:16,670
I give him lots of hugs and kisses.

5609
04:12:17,690 --> 04:12:18,110
So...

5610
04:12:18,110 --> 04:12:20,950
Hopefully, he knows that he's not being replaced.

5611
04:12:21,690 --> 04:12:22,350
Mm-hmm.

5612
04:12:22,410 --> 04:12:22,530
Okay.

5613
04:12:23,070 --> 04:12:23,330
Okay.

5614
04:12:24,710 --> 04:12:25,110
So...

5615
04:12:25,110 --> 04:12:25,450
Um...

5616
04:12:25,870 --> 04:12:26,550
Okay, guys.

5617
04:12:26,610 --> 04:12:27,410
I think I'm gonna go...

5618
04:12:27,410 --> 04:12:28,410
I gotta get some more water.

5619
04:12:28,910 --> 04:12:30,490
So I think I'm gonna go head out.

5620
04:12:31,350 --> 04:12:31,750
Um...

5621
04:12:32,310 --> 04:12:33,070
I will...

5622
04:12:33,510 --> 04:12:34,270
I'm probably...

5623
04:12:34,270 --> 04:12:34,390
Okay.

5624
04:12:34,410 --> 04:12:35,970
So I'm gonna make a schedule for this week.

5625
04:12:36,010 --> 04:12:37,930
But I'm also gonna write like on it like...

5626
04:12:37,930 --> 04:12:44,870
Off Kai and then also for next week and the week after.

5627
04:12:46,630 --> 04:12:51,010
I'm basically gonna be gone three weeks now that I think about it.

5628
04:12:51,950 --> 04:12:52,350
Wait.

5629
04:12:52,430 --> 04:12:53,070
Not three weeks.

5630
04:12:53,970 --> 04:12:54,830
Two weeks.

5631
04:12:54,930 --> 04:12:55,170
Two weeks.

5632
04:12:56,430 --> 04:12:58,030
But I will still be streaming.

5633
04:12:58,610 --> 04:12:59,130
So...

5634
04:13:00,590 --> 04:13:02,410
And then once I get back...

5635
04:13:02,410 --> 04:13:04,350
Once I get back from Japan...

5636
04:13:05,010 --> 04:13:05,610
Thank you!

5637
04:13:05,850 --> 04:13:07,810
Thanks to the five gifts and thank you!

5638
04:13:08,610 --> 04:13:09,590
You guys...

5639
04:13:09,590 --> 04:13:11,070
I was gonna ask for permission.

5640
04:13:12,030 --> 04:13:12,550
But...

5641
04:13:13,750 --> 04:13:14,830
I'm not asking.

5642
04:13:15,090 --> 04:13:16,250
When I get back...

5643
04:13:16,250 --> 04:13:19,310
Metal Gear Saturdays are back on the menu, baby!

5644
04:13:20,250 --> 04:13:20,770
Whippy!

5645
04:13:23,370 --> 04:13:25,250
Starting at Metal Gear Solid 1.

5646
04:13:25,410 --> 04:13:28,990
And we'll be playing Metal Gear up until...

5647
04:13:28,990 --> 04:13:31,110
Whenever I feel like stopping.

5648
04:13:35,050 --> 04:13:35,610
So...

5649
04:13:36,350 --> 04:13:36,730
Yippee!

5650
04:13:40,170 --> 04:13:40,730
Yippee!

5651
04:13:41,590 --> 04:13:43,390
Is Fortnite a snake count?

5652
04:13:43,550 --> 04:13:43,950
Oh my gosh!

5653
04:13:43,990 --> 04:13:45,250
I should play that, right?

5654
04:13:45,910 --> 04:13:46,710
I should...

5655
04:13:46,710 --> 04:13:49,090
I wonder if I could get Doki to play Fortnite with me.

5656
04:13:51,170 --> 04:13:52,470
I should ask her.

5657
04:13:55,290 --> 04:13:55,850
So...

5658
04:13:55,850 --> 04:13:57,430
We're finally getting acid!

5659
04:13:57,590 --> 04:13:57,890
Yeah!

5660
04:13:58,190 --> 04:13:58,590
Yeah!

5661
04:13:59,390 --> 04:14:00,510
So I did...

5662
04:14:00,510 --> 04:14:01,630
I know I did the twin snakes...

5663
04:14:01,630 --> 04:14:02,710
Some time ago...

5664
04:14:02,710 --> 04:14:09,390
But I really really just wanna have all of the Metal Gears kind of on my resume in my channel.

5665
04:14:09,770 --> 04:14:10,330
So...

5666
04:14:11,330 --> 04:14:12,970
I hope you guys don't mind...

5667
04:14:12,970 --> 04:14:17,190
That I'll be playing a lot of Metal Gear up until probably the end of the year.

5668
04:14:19,690 --> 04:14:20,670
Are we getting survive?

5669
04:14:21,130 --> 04:14:22,990
Oh, that's another thing I need to play with Doki.

5670
04:14:27,790 --> 04:14:28,870
There's too much stuff.

5671
04:14:29,590 --> 04:14:31,770
Eliezer, thank you for the super chat.

5672
04:14:31,830 --> 04:14:32,330
Thank you.

5673
04:14:33,970 --> 04:14:35,150
Hoping for Ace Combat 2.

5674
04:14:35,270 --> 04:14:39,910
I think once I'm done with the Metal Gear stuff, I will go into Ace Combat.

5675
04:14:40,130 --> 04:14:43,270
And then I think after Ace Combat, I might even start Xenoblade.

5676
04:14:43,270 --> 04:14:47,310
So, it is a long journey.

5677
04:14:47,850 --> 04:14:50,610
Time to put Doki into playing MGS.

5678
04:14:52,950 --> 04:14:56,210
But it will be like a long...

5679
04:14:56,210 --> 04:15:01,530
I feel like almost probably a year's worth of just like long story-based games.

5680
04:15:05,110 --> 04:15:07,770
You can, I guess, look forward to that.

5681
04:15:09,550 --> 04:15:10,190
Yippee!

5682
04:15:13,270 --> 04:15:13,810
And of course...

5683
04:15:13,810 --> 04:15:15,110
And of course...

5684
04:15:17,890 --> 04:15:20,090
It's not just the only stuff that I'll be playing.

5685
04:15:20,390 --> 04:15:21,890
So, Memble, Fortnite maybe?

5686
04:15:22,190 --> 04:15:23,070
That'd be fun!

5687
04:15:23,290 --> 04:15:24,610
Wait, can we do like a lobby?

5688
04:15:25,850 --> 04:15:26,930
Or is it...

5689
04:15:26,930 --> 04:15:28,210
Would I have to...

5690
04:15:31,130 --> 04:15:33,270
Can I do a lobby or...

5691
04:15:35,830 --> 04:15:36,710
Monado time.

5692
04:15:38,430 --> 04:15:39,150
Yes, you can.

5693
04:15:41,010 --> 04:15:43,250
Is Ape Escape 3 a part of...

5694
04:15:43,270 --> 04:15:46,270
Metal Gear Solid Completionism?

5695
04:15:46,510 --> 04:15:48,630
Asking for a totally not monkey friend.

5696
04:15:48,930 --> 04:15:51,850
I want to do as much Metal Gear stuff as I can.

5697
04:15:52,050 --> 04:15:54,290
So, it is not off the table.

5698
04:15:59,990 --> 04:16:02,050
Hoping for a Minecraft adventure with Doki.

5699
04:16:02,150 --> 04:16:03,170
Maybe finding diamonds.

5700
04:16:03,490 --> 04:16:03,970
Again?

5701
04:16:04,710 --> 04:16:06,670
I don't think I've ever gone on a diamond...

5702
04:16:06,670 --> 04:16:07,550
thing.

5703
04:16:09,630 --> 04:16:10,570
But I will see.

5704
04:16:10,830 --> 04:16:11,430
We will see.

5705
04:16:12,210 --> 04:16:12,690
MangaCon!

5706
04:16:12,750 --> 04:16:13,590
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

5707
04:16:13,650 --> 04:16:14,110
Thank you.

5708
04:16:14,110 --> 04:16:17,770
But yeah, that's just kind of some of my future plans that I've been thinking about.

5709
04:16:18,470 --> 04:16:18,830
And...

5710
04:16:20,990 --> 04:16:24,290
Like I said, I know I've played Metal Gear before.

5711
04:16:24,430 --> 04:16:27,830
So, I hope that it will still be a fun experience for people.

5712
04:16:27,930 --> 04:16:28,710
I was kind of nervous.

5713
04:16:28,970 --> 04:16:31,410
Because I was like, what if people don't want to watch me play.

5714
04:16:31,490 --> 04:16:33,390
If I've already played everything before.

5715
04:16:33,530 --> 04:16:35,590
And I already know all the twists and I know this and that.

5716
04:16:36,410 --> 04:16:36,770
But...

5717
04:16:39,970 --> 04:16:40,330
Hopefully...

5718
04:16:41,010 --> 04:16:42,890
Like I said, I kind of just want...

5719
04:16:42,890 --> 04:16:44,470
The games on my channel.

5720
04:16:44,570 --> 04:16:45,810
So if people...

5721
04:16:45,810 --> 04:16:47,750
Come to my channel, they're just like...

5722
04:16:47,750 --> 04:16:49,530
Wow, she really likes Metal Gear.

5723
04:16:51,210 --> 04:16:54,170
You can always play MGS1 Integral English and VR missions.

5724
04:16:54,410 --> 04:16:55,530
Check them off your resume.

5725
04:16:55,730 --> 04:16:58,210
And then you can officially say you've played all versions of MGS1.

5726
04:16:58,390 --> 04:16:58,810
True!

5727
04:17:00,490 --> 04:17:02,150
One thing that I wanted to do...

5728
04:17:02,150 --> 04:17:03,030
Was...

5729
04:17:05,330 --> 04:17:06,290
Was play...

5730
04:17:06,810 --> 04:17:08,990
The different versions of the game.

5731
04:17:09,190 --> 04:17:10,090
So basically, like...

5732
04:17:10,090 --> 04:17:13,430
If I play the HD collection of something...

5733
04:17:13,430 --> 04:17:16,230
Maybe I'll play the original PS2 version of it.

5734
04:17:16,330 --> 04:17:17,150
This time.

5735
04:17:17,870 --> 04:17:18,450
So...

5736
04:17:19,090 --> 04:17:20,610
I'm still working on that.

5737
04:17:20,930 --> 04:17:21,570
To...

5738
04:17:24,870 --> 04:17:26,550
To give it a little bit of...

5739
04:17:26,550 --> 04:17:27,090
Difference.

5740
04:17:31,790 --> 04:17:34,310
Hey Bozo, do better...

5741
04:17:34,310 --> 04:17:36,010
Oh, do better...

5742
04:17:36,010 --> 04:17:36,310
What?

5743
04:17:36,310 --> 04:17:36,430
What?

5744
04:17:38,430 --> 04:17:39,950
Oh sorry, I'll do better.

5745
04:17:40,130 --> 04:17:42,350
You better do whatever the hell you want.

5746
04:17:48,010 --> 04:17:50,190
I completely read it as do better.

5747
04:17:54,990 --> 04:17:55,510
Stop!

5748
04:17:56,930 --> 04:17:59,050
I'm gonna cry again with Peace Walker ending.

5749
04:17:59,230 --> 04:17:59,850
Me too!

5750
04:18:00,530 --> 04:18:01,230
Oh gosh.

5751
04:18:01,430 --> 04:18:01,810
I just...

5752
04:18:01,810 --> 04:18:04,530
I'm actually most excited to play MGS2 again.

5753
04:18:05,190 --> 04:18:05,710
Truly.

5754
04:18:06,310 --> 04:18:07,690
I think at the end I'm just gonna be a...

5755
04:18:08,330 --> 04:18:10,550
Little baby ball and just like...

5756
04:18:10,550 --> 04:18:10,850
I don't know.

5757
04:18:10,930 --> 04:18:13,590
There's something about the end of MGS2 that makes me feel so...

5758
04:18:13,590 --> 04:18:15,910
Even though it was right and so silly, dumb, stupid.

5759
04:18:18,090 --> 04:18:18,890
But yeah.

5760
04:18:21,990 --> 04:18:22,390
Anyway.

5761
04:18:24,610 --> 04:18:25,630
Do better, Mint.

5762
04:18:31,050 --> 04:18:31,450
Okay.

5763
04:18:32,590 --> 04:18:32,990
Okay.

5764
04:18:33,150 --> 04:18:33,970
I'm gonna go to bed.

5765
04:18:35,470 --> 04:18:36,270
And um...

5766
04:18:36,270 --> 04:18:37,250
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

5767
04:18:37,790 --> 04:18:38,950
Don't know what I'm playing tomorrow.

5768
04:18:40,210 --> 04:18:40,750
Oh wait.

5769
04:18:40,830 --> 04:18:42,190
Maybe I think I do know...

5770
04:18:42,190 --> 04:18:42,430
Why don't...

5771
04:18:42,430 --> 04:18:42,550
Wait.

5772
04:18:44,430 --> 04:18:44,830
Uh...

5773
04:18:44,830 --> 04:18:47,590
I had an idea for something I was gonna do tomorrow and I don't remember.

5774
04:18:47,870 --> 04:18:48,270
So I'm gonna...

5775
04:18:48,270 --> 04:18:49,150
I'm gonna sleep on it.

5776
04:18:49,790 --> 04:18:51,670
No Mint not Metal Gear Survive is the...

5777
04:18:52,610 --> 04:18:54,150
I have to do it!

5778
04:18:55,690 --> 04:18:56,550
Just a little bit.

5779
04:18:56,790 --> 04:18:57,550
Just a little bit.

5780
04:18:58,850 --> 04:19:03,370
Any chance of uploading your truck rave performance to members to premiere on one of your off days?

5781
04:19:03,550 --> 04:19:03,950
I don't know.

5782
04:19:03,950 --> 04:19:05,730
For those of us who can't make it to Off-Kai.

5783
04:19:06,870 --> 04:19:07,310
Oh!

5784
04:19:08,330 --> 04:19:08,770
Um...

5785
04:19:08,770 --> 04:19:09,290
I can try.

5786
04:19:10,130 --> 04:19:10,570
Uh...

5787
04:19:11,790 --> 04:19:12,230
I...

5788
04:19:12,230 --> 04:19:12,590
Oh!

5789
04:19:12,790 --> 04:19:14,090
The one that I recorded.

5790
04:19:14,210 --> 04:19:15,110
I pre-recorded.

5791
04:19:15,910 --> 04:19:16,350
Um...

5792
04:19:17,130 --> 04:19:17,570
Yes.

5793
04:19:17,850 --> 04:19:22,830
Let me write that down so I can have it set up as a premiere for the weekend.

5794
04:19:25,970 --> 04:19:26,410
Um...

5795
04:19:27,230 --> 04:19:27,670
Upload...

5796
04:19:27,670 --> 04:19:28,150
Oh!

5797
04:19:30,390 --> 04:19:31,410
What just happened?

5798
04:19:34,990 --> 04:19:35,890
I jumped.

5799
04:19:36,110 --> 04:19:36,810
I did a...

5800
04:19:36,810 --> 04:19:37,550
I did a jump.

5801
04:19:38,450 --> 04:19:38,930
Um...

5802
04:19:38,930 --> 04:19:39,170
Upload...

5803
04:19:40,210 --> 04:19:40,690
Truck...

5804
04:19:40,690 --> 04:19:41,870
To members.

5805
04:19:43,150 --> 04:19:43,630
Hmm.

5806
04:19:47,790 --> 04:19:48,690
What was that?

5807
04:19:48,850 --> 04:19:49,550
I don't even know.

5808
04:19:50,910 --> 04:19:51,830
Okie dokie.

5809
04:19:51,950 --> 04:19:53,630
Thank you guys for hanging out with me!

5810
04:19:53,770 --> 04:19:54,710
Thank you guys for...

5811
04:19:54,710 --> 04:19:55,530
Um...

5812
04:19:55,530 --> 04:19:57,970
Spending your Monday with me!

5813
04:19:58,470 --> 04:19:58,950
