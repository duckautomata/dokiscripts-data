1
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Good

2
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,700
morning, Minto!

3
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,580
What do you say besides good morning, Minto?

4
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,960
That's all I say.

5
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,000
Good morning, Minto!

6
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,340
What if it's not the morning?

7
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,920
It's morning somewhere.

8
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,700
Good afternoon, Minto!

9
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah!

10
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,380
Yay!

11
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,140
Yay!

12
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
It's always the quiz.

13
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,940
The VTuber sayings quiz at the start of any collab.

14
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
I know, right?

15
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,300
What do you say?

16
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,680
What do you do?

17
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,240
We're here, we're green, and we're playing Resident Evil 6.

18
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,120
Yes, and I think we both have no idea what this game is.

19
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
Somehow, I've wanted to play the co-op Resident Evils, though.

20
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,380
Me too, me too.

21
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,340
Yeah, I've been wanting to play.

22
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,880
But you said you've played 7 and... 7 and... Yeah, and 8.

23
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,220
8.

24
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,500
8.

25
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,780
Yeah.

26
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,080
Or at least I'm familiar with 8.

27
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,440
But I think the older ones are super different.

28
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,220
We got... We got Leon here.

29
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,340
Yeah.

30
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,960
I honestly... Have you played Silent Hill?

31
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,580
Mm-hmm.

32
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,500
I honestly thought that Leon was... James.

33
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,980
James was Leon.

34
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,640
I think... I think that would insult some people.

35
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,360
I think some people are gonna get, like, triggered by that.

36
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,440
But... But... We don't have to pit two...

37
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,500
Two goats against each other, right?

38
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,940
Wait, did you play Silent Hill?

39
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,460
I played the remake of Silent Hill 2.

40
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,580
We're thinking... What?

41
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,540
James is the goat?

42
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Wait, why not?

43
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,080
He...

44
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,820
I don't know.

45
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,660
I like the ending.

46
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,740
Well, have you played it?

47
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,520
Can I spoil it?

48
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,340
I played... I didn't play the remake.

49
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,100
I played the original.

50
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,980
Maybe it's a different experience.

51
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,740
Maybe.

52
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,900
I don't know.

53
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,040
I like the ending where he...

54
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,360
He drives into the lake to be with his beloved in the afterlife forever.

55
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,040
Yeah.

56
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,070
I think that makes him pretty...

57
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,790
Pretty good.

58
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,950
I mean...

59
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,150
I'm understanding your...

60
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,610
Your romantic interests.

61
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,270
Yeah.

62
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:50,770
Yeah.

63
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,650
I like it tragic and toxic.

64
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,850
Well, you know...

65
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,770
I get that.

66
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,950
I get that.

67
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,030
If she can't be happy...

68
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,870
She shouldn't be happy either.

69
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,230
Yeah.

70
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,430
You know, I think you're changing my perspective a little bit.

71
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,770
I...

72
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,530
Oh yeah.

73
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,250
Oh yeah.

74
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,310
Well, so I don't know about Leon.

75
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,590
I don't know.

76
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,110
I think Leon is like a good guy.

77
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,950
I think he's like...

78
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,030
Right?

79
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,390
I think he's like...

80
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,350
Like...

81
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,970
Normal guy.

82
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,910
So he wouldn't...

83
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,630
Hallucinate a hot lady with the same face as his wife?

84
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,670
Probably not.

85
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,130
For him to...

86
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,110
Have an affair with.

87
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,980
Leon is textbook good guy according to Chai.

88
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,680
Oh, he's a himbo.

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,520
Okay.

90
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:50,740
Okay.

91
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,480
I like that.

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,280
I like that too.

93
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,880
You know, Nimi...

94
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,540
If you really like toxic...

95
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,620
I'm just gonna say it right now.

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,280
Yeah?

97
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,640
You should play...

98
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,800
You should play Metal Gear.

99
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,040
Really?

100
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
Is it toxic?

101
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,820
Oh...

102
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,900
Oh, man.

103
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Oh, boy.

104
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,480
Yeah.

105
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,480
Actually...

106
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,820
It's on my list to play.

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,540
Wait, actually?

108
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,220
Yeah, I want to...

109
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,340
I mean, there's a lot of games.

110
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,040
I need to...

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm gonna play it at some point.

112
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:25,880
For sure.

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,740
You heard it here first, folks.

114
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,420
I'll try to bump it up in my list.

115
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,040
No, no.

116
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,600
You don't have to.

117
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,080
Get through what you want first.

118
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
I'm just saying...

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
I feel like I'm obligated...

120
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,580
To say...

121
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,480
To bring it up at least once, you know?

122
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,160
Yeah, the Metal Gear Solid ambassador.

123
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,400
My unofficial title, yeah.

124
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,880
I wanted to play it.

125
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,100
It's like...

126
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,940
I feel...

127
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,100
It was like...

128
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,760
Improperly advertised to me.

129
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,800
I thought it was like...

130
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,540
Cool guy...

131
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,880
Military game.

132
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,840
But it's not at all.

133
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,880
Not...

134
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,720
What is it?

135
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,580
It's like...

136
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:09,880
Stealth.

137
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,800
You're in a box.

138
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,160
That's what I know about Metal Gear.

139
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,160
It's like...

140
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
Super...

141
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,140
Like...

142
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,600
It's super like...

143
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,160
Interpersonal relationships.

144
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,200
Oh.

145
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,200
And like...

146
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,700
How...

147
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,120
Do you get to choose things?

148
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,400
Or do you just watch?

149
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,160
You just watch.

150
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,840
It's a movie.

151
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,560
That's...

152
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,080
That's good.

153
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
I like a movie game.

154
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,320
I like to sit.

155
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:32,960
Watch.

156
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,940
The fourth game has a cutscene that's over an hour long.

157
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,040
Real movie game.

158
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,540
Yeah.

159
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,780
Real movie game.

160
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,240
I'll pull it out for when I don't feel like streaming.

161
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,740
I just feel like watching.

162
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,540
And then you've played Hitman before.

163
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,680
So you can like...

164
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,100
Use your...

165
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,180
Hitman...

166
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,040
Uh...

167
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,840
Special...

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,100
T.

169
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,700
Is it similar?

170
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,420
I guess...

171
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,880
Hitman's also like stealth...

172
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,120
Game.

173
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,820
Yeah.

174
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,220
Actually, I've never played Hitman.

175
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,840
It's funny.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
I was thinking about starting the Hitman series.

177
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,220
And then...

178
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,300
The same week...

179
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,060
You played it.

180
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,620
And I was like...

181
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:13,860
Whoa.

182
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,900
You should play it.

183
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,740
That's my Oshii.

184
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,280
She's got the same brain as me.

185
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,800
It's good.

186
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,220
But I've never played the story though.

187
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:23,800
Oh.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,140
Oh.

189
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,400
You're just in it for the thrill.

190
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,260
I think I...

191
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,380
I think I...

192
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,500
I'm talking people.

193
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,040
There's a roguelite mode.

194
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,100
Where you can play it infinitely.

195
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,100
And it's...

196
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,140
What?

197
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,400
Me, that's...

198
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,240
That's everything.

199
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:39,820
What?

200
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,060
That sounds so fun.

201
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,820
It's very fun.

202
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,980
And it's pretty hard.

203
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,100
It's very hard.

204
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,820
Oh.

205
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,080
But...

206
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,360
What?

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,220
Now that I've played it...

208
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,460
Because...

209
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,540
The story mode...

210
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,980
In comparison...

211
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,060
Feels kind of like...

212
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,800
On rails.

213
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,340
You know?

214
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,600
The story mode is very good.

215
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,780
You should probably play it...

216
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,160
First.

217
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,660
Don't be like me.

218
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,680
Otherwise...

219
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,040
You'll feel like...

220
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,120
You put the training wheels back on.

221
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,520
Oh.

222
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,500
I see.

223
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:03,820
Yeah.

224
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,480
I get it.

225
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,480
You're like too...

226
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,660
You're far beyond...

227
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,120
What the story mode offers.

228
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,840
Even though it's still good.

229
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,780
She's a professional, everybody.

230
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,240
I'm not.

231
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm not.

232
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,140
I haven't...

233
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,620
You...

234
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,620
You need to...

235
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,120
If to be a professional...

236
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,280
You have to get the bloody suit.

237
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,780
Which is your trophy...

238
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,520
For beating hardcore freelancer.

239
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,300
And I don't have it.

240
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,340
Wait.

241
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,060
Do like...

242
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,740
People freak out.

243
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,180
They're like...

244
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,940
Why is this guy covered in blood?

245
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,480
Or is it just like...

246
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:31,540
No.

247
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,580
They don't care.

248
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,400
They don't care.

249
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,280
It's cosmetic.

250
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,220
Same as if you dress as a clown.

251
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,180
They don't care.

252
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,800
It's pretty great.

253
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,040
You can wear whatever you want.

254
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,920
You can dress up.

255
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,900
Age of 47.

256
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,040
And it doesn't matter.

257
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,580
It doesn't matter.

258
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,500
I thought that you had like...

259
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,700
Disguises and stuff.

260
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,800
Well, there are disguises.

261
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,580
But what you start with...

262
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,460
They don't care.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,760
Does he get hair?

264
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,860
He could get a wig...

265
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,800
In the clown outfit.

266
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,620
A rainbow.

267
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,020
A rainbow clown wig.

268
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,560
A rainbow clown wig.

269
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,220
I don't know if he has any hair...

270
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,000
Other than that though.

271
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,800
I don't think he should have hair.

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I don't think so either.

273
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,640
He's better bald.

274
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,940
It would feel weird.

275
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,340
We can both be bald.

276
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,680
Unkeen.

277
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,170
My hotkeys never work.

278
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,130
Unkeen.

279
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,750
A collab.

280
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,090
Where's my bald hotkey?

281
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,630
Oh no.

282
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,170
You're...

283
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,570
It's breezy.

284
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,770
It's breezy.

285
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,630
It's breezy.

286
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,070
How come I do...

287
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,610
Do you...

288
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,750
I use my stream deck.

289
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:42,970
Are you a pro?

290
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,610
Yeah, but...

291
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,830
Mine never works...

292
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,630
When I'm in a collab.

293
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,350
Really?

294
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,170
Wait, wait.

295
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,390
Isn't some on this screen?

296
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,350
Oh, it is.

297
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,890
Never mind.

298
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,470
It works.

299
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,030
It works.

300
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,910
Beautiful.

301
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:57,870
Beautiful.

302
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,470
We're ready to Hitman.

303
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,490
We are.

304
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,970
I wish Hitman had multiplayer.

305
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,330
We're so good.

306
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:05,510
We're so good.

307
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,410
Bomb.

308
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,230
Oh my gosh, so shiny.

309
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,230
Your head.

310
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,010
Oh, you too.

311
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,750
It's like...

312
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,990
Like two cubals.

313
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,390
Like a carton of eggs.

314
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,390
Yeah.

315
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,550
Oh my gosh.

316
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,890
It really does look like we're two little eggs.

317
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,590
Wait.

318
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,430
If I...

319
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,890
Hold on.

320
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,310
I'm going to put us down a little bit.

321
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,330
So you only see the top of our...

322
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,630
Wow.

323
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,250
I feel like my head's way bigger than yours.

324
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,970
I'm feeling self-conscious.

325
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,150
You have the bigger brain.

326
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,750
That's why.

327
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,890
I'm not.

328
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,870
You're just really, really smart.

329
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,670
I'm not.

330
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,870
No.

331
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,480
Oh my goodness.

332
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,660
It's all just like...

333
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Toxic vampire romance in my brain.

334
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,400
That's what it's filled with.

335
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,380
To the brim.

336
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,360
To the brim.

337
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
From...

338
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,100
From what medium?

339
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,960
I mean, of course, it started with Twilight.

340
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,460
But...

341
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,100
You know.

342
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,860
Well, lately I've been playing...

343
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,940
The Witcher.

344
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,880
Oh, yeah.

345
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,260
I saw it.

346
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,820
You'll see.

347
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,920
Yeah, and there's...

348
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,800
There's vampires in there.

349
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,080
You can write so much fan fiction about those vampires.

350
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,640
Vampires.

351
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,280
Vampires.

352
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,980
Should we...

353
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,260
Should we get into this game?

354
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,740
I guess we should probably.

355
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,180
We put our hair back on.

356
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,780
I like how yours like flies away.

357
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,060
It does.

358
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,260
I can like...

359
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,120
I can like tease it.

360
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,980
I'm like...

361
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,420
Yours is so good though.

362
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,420
Takes my ears off too.

363
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:01,980
I know.

364
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,700
The mutilation.

365
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,880
I know.

366
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,080
Okay, let me make the room then.

367
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,840
We tried doing this earlier, you guys.

368
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,740
And...

369
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,360
I picked Ada because I thought...

370
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,300
Nimi would be able to pick someone else.

371
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,160
But we...

372
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,480
Wait, it says continue.

373
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,340
Uh-oh, wait.

374
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,040
Uh-oh.

375
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,960
We locked in.

376
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,700
Let me just do the chapter select and we'll start.

377
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:26,700
Okay.

378
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,720
Okay, here...

379
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,020
Wait.

380
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,400
This is...

381
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,180
What's the prelude?

382
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,160
I think that's the tutorial that we did.

383
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,520
Yes.

384
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
We did the tutorial.

385
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,040
So I guess I will be...

386
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
Leon.

387
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:39,880
Okay.

388
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,700
And you might be...

389
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,680
Helena.

390
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,500
Helena.

391
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,640
Oh, you are!

392
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,620
My favorite Nike Nike Nike romance song.

393
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,900
Wait a second.

394
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:50,420
Wait.

395
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,880
Go back.

396
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,700
Did it let me do...

397
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,480
Multiplayer?

398
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:55,960
Wait.

399
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I think...

400
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,900
I hope so.

401
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,240
Let me in.

402
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me in.

403
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,740
Oh, here we...

404
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,280
Uh...

405
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,500
Yes.

406
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:01,900
Here we go.

407
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,140
Okay.

408
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,760
Difficulty normal.

409
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,760
Screen single.

410
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,000
So each of us have our own POV.

411
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,420
Oh, do you want to be Leon?

412
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,020
I could be Helena if you want.

413
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,660
I want to be Leon.

414
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,580
Oh, yeah.

415
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,200
Okay.

416
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,040
All right.

417
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,620
I think this is all...

418
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,940
Guys, what is the attack reaction?

419
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,780
Is that like QTEs?

420
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,500
The QTEs are so funny to me.

421
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:29,840
I know!

422
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,560
In this game.

423
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,980
It's like you're falling out of a helicopter...

424
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,000
And they're like...

425
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,320
Spin the right stick around in a circle.

426
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,660
We're in no rush here.

427
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
Peak gameplay.

428
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,820
I love the QTEs.

429
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,320
Oh, oh, it's friendly fire.

430
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
Oh, wait.

431
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,140
Um, maybe we don't want friendly fire.

432
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,200
Yeah, maybe, maybe not.

433
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,340
Okay.

434
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,340
Just kidding.

435
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

436
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,600
Then, what's agent hunt settings?

437
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,520
I don't, it won't even let me change that.

438
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,700
I don't even know.

439
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't know.

440
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,640
Um, okay.

441
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,440
Start game.

442
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,100
And then, I invite you.

443
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,380
Yes.

444
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,600
I invite you.

445
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,900
Some people said that this game is bad.

446
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,100
I've heard that too.

447
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,200
Is it really?

448
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,700
Where is it?

449
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,600
Where is the peak?

450
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,900
Oh, I failed to join your game session.

451
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,540
Oh, don't!

452
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,420
Uh-oh.

453
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,560
Let me redo.

454
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,420
Um, I've heard that it's like Kuso game.

455
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,140
Well, I love Kuso game.

456
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,840
Yeah, me too.

457
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,900
So, I think it's fine.

458
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,640
Yeah.

459
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,160
We're in.

460
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,520
Are we in?

461
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,600
Are you in?

462
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,820
Did you make it?

463
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,460
I'm loading.

464
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,180
Are you in tall?

465
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,720
Oh, I'm in!

466
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,380
There's a...

467
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,740
Yes!

468
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,900
Cut scene!

469
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,500
Cut scene!

470
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,960
Bio-organic weapons are a global threat.

471
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,540
Start working with the rest of the world.

472
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,540
Raccoon City.

473
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,200
Raccoon City.

474
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,640
Raccoon City.

475
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,500
Raccoon City.

476
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,800
Raccoon City.

477
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,760
Is this like a recap of the last game?

478
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,020
Is the audio doubled for you too?

479
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,560
It's doubled for you?

480
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,860
Oh, wait.

481
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,040
I think it was for cinematic effects.

482
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:24,740
Oh, yeah, yeah.

483
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,460
Mr. President!

484
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,420
Oh, it's that scene.

485
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,680
It was that famous image.

486
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,940
I don't know it.

487
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,480
I need to catch up on my lore.

488
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,900
The zombie looking at the screen like that?

489
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,320
Yeah.

490
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,620
Hmm.

491
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,160
Mr. President!

492
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,600
He's still hesitating.

493
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,380
Like, oh, maybe he's still in there.

494
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,580
Yeah.

495
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,860
Maybe we can fix him still.

496
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,880
I think the, you know, the...

497
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,080
The tree bark skin is a dead giveaway.

498
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,420
He's not coming back.

499
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,780
Or maybe he's just like, I don't want to go to jail for killing the president.

500
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,840
I don't know if they're going to pardon me just because he's a zombie.

501
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,760
Who would pardon?

502
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,980
That's true.

503
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,520
You killed the president!

504
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,500
What are you talking about?

505
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,400
What are you talking about?

506
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,900
Tolong's Cathedral.

507
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,820
I'll explain everything there, Agent Kennedy.

508
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,500
Wait, are we a president too?

509
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,620
No, we're...

510
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,020
Agent Kennedy?

511
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh!

512
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,380
Oh my gosh, are we related?

513
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,340
That's why we murdered the president so we could take our rightful throne.

514
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,240
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,800
That's how it works.

516
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,380
I hate to rush introductions, but I need a report on this situation.

517
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Trial by combat.

518
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,300
I killed the president.

519
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,280
Oh my god!

520
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,420
He had already been infected by the time we found him.

521
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,500
He's not all got you.

522
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:01,720
Leon...

523
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,680
Leon did what he had to.

524
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,900
He saved my life.

525
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,380
Does that make it okay?

526
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah.

527
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,560
Bro, who is this girl?

528
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,820
I mean, I know he was a zombie.

529
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,160
The virus has already spread three miles past the camera's perimeter, and it's not going down.

530
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,120
I'm like, to hurry?

531
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,220
Not before we check out Taluk's cathedral.

532
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,920
Agent Kennedy's got a lead that might tell us who's responsible for this.

533
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,280
Leon, is that true?

534
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,760
She's like, just say yes.

535
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,080
I think I might have something.

536
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm not about to say this.

537
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,640
Leon, Leon, yeah.

538
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,460
I got a lead.

539
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,540
You will if you come with me.

540
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,460
Are they an item?

541
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,000
Hot stuff.

542
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,380
No.

543
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:58,800
No?

544
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,320
Oh.

545
00:21:59,640 --> 00:21:59,780
No?

546
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,780
Wait, is this Helena?

547
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,820
Yeah, yeah, you're Helena.

548
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,400
Leon only cares about Ada.

549
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:08,900
Oh, no.

550
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,720
Oh.

551
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,740
She was in a submarine, you guys.

552
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,600
We saw a nice little glimpse of her.

553
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,240
Yeah.

554
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,820
Oh, my gosh.

555
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,660
It's hard to explain.

556
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,700
He says you're in the name of the cathedral.

557
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,140
You may not believe me.

558
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
Do I look like a Nimmy?

559
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh, yeah.

560
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,480
I don't know.

561
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,360
I've been watching Game of Thrones, and all I can see is that he looks kind of like Jamie Lannister.

562
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,660
I've never seen Game of Thrones, but I believe you.

563
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,760
It's...

564
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,560
I like it too much, possibly.

565
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,360
Are you going to finish it?

566
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,520
Apparently, it gets really bad.

567
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,520
Yeah, I was going to say...

568
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,880
I haven't finished it yet.

569
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,640
I was going to say, so I feel like I've heard some people are...

570
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,080
You're going to tell me everything once we get to the cathedral.

571
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,480
Stop talking, Leon.

572
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:54,840
Deal.

573
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,240
Hey, don't tell me to shut up.

574
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,400
But yeah, I've heard some people say that they just don't finish the series because they know it gets bad.

575
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,180
Well, that's my plan.

576
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,080
Because the books end.

577
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,440
There's no ending.

578
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,140
My thing just had like a...

579
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh, space.

580
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,420
Oh, space.

581
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,420
Are you using mouse and keyboard?

582
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah, I'm being...

583
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,280
I'm...

584
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,600
You're ready to game.

585
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,440
I am...

586
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,980
Wait, but there was like a little investigation icon.

587
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,260
Where did it go?

588
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,280
I clicked it.

589
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:24,980
Oh, you did.

590
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,380
You just said the powers out.

591
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,320
Oh, that's it.

592
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,700
I don't know why you didn't see ya.

593
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,300
Okay.

594
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,520
We're being nice and secret.

595
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,520
We're...

596
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,620
We're being nice and slow and steady.

597
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,100
Mm-hmm.

598
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,360
I don't know what we're doing.

599
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,020
We're going to the cathedral, baby.

600
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,620
Okay.

601
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,440
Ivy University.

602
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,200
Is that where we're at?

603
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,860
Why are we here?

604
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,780
Is this where the pres...

605
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,820
Why is the president at the university?

606
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,040
Oh, suddenly I can run.

607
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,580
Well, did it ever say he was the president of the United States?

608
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,620
Maybe he is just the president of this university.

609
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,540
That's true.

610
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,740
Whoa, this place is fancy.

611
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,620
Yeah, it is.

612
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,820
Is there really a zombie outbreak?

613
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,340
It's kind of dangerous to leave those candles on.

614
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,140
That's what I always think about.

615
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,660
One time I left a candle on all night and I woke up...

616
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,400
You too?

617
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,500
I've done that before.

618
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
I can't believe this is happening again.

619
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,840
I have like a candle warmer sometimes too that I use.

620
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,420
And I'll like go on walks and come back and be like, oh, it smells so nice in here.

621
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,120
That was my thought when I woke up the next day and walked out into the living room.

622
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,920
Oh, it smells so good in here.

623
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,920
Oh, wait.

624
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,220
I did it just the other day so now I'm thinking about...

625
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,020
Did you?

626
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,440
Well, the warmer is not as dangerous.

627
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah, probably.

628
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,280
President!

629
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,120
Only one way to find out.

630
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:05,960
Let's go.

631
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,080
Oh, we're running?

632
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,180
Oh, now we're fast.

633
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,440
Follow the shadow.

634
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay.

635
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,360
Wait, what?

636
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,660
Why is it a...

637
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,240
These tables are huge.

638
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,100
They are.

639
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,460
We just...

640
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,720
We're like hobbits.

641
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,320
Look at the stairs.

642
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,180
I know.

643
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,580
They're so tiny.

644
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,500
Dinner for giants.

645
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,080
Yeah.

646
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,900
This is actual Minto point of view.

647
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,640
Why am I taking strays?

648
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,100
Is it the kitchen?

649
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,720
The meat locker?

650
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,260
The meat locker.

651
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,380
There's always one.

652
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,820
Yeah, that's true.

653
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, there actually is one.

654
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,700
You're right.

655
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,600
Every horror game has to have one.

656
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,660
That is some...

657
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,500
What is wrong with this meat?

658
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,000
Wait, where?

659
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,360
On the table.

660
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,100
It's so colorful.

661
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,740
Christmas.

662
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
Yeah, what is this?

663
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,380
Somebody's casserole?

664
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,920
Oh, it's cake?

665
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,680
No.

666
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,020
This is a cake?

667
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,180
It's got like avocado slices on top.

668
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,540
Spare gets weird.

669
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,480
It's a veggie cake.

670
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,080
It's very Midwest potluck inspired.

671
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,300
Uh-oh.

672
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,640
I hear someone coughing in there.

673
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,960
Time gate...

674
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,040
Oh!

675
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,540
Get your gun ready.

676
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,460
Wait!

677
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,500
Don't shoot!

678
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,120
Okay.

679
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,700
Oh.

680
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,180
Oh, he's about to turn.

681
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,780
Yeah.

682
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,400
I can tell.

683
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,240
Are you alright?

684
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,680
Don't touch him!

685
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,920
The fog.

686
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,440
Unless he's got asthma.

687
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,980
We might be judging too early.

688
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,520
Yeah, have you ever thought...

689
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,480
Like, if you had asthma during the zombie apocalypse...

690
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,160
How bad that would suck?

691
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,940
That would be so bad.

692
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,180
Wait, let me go!

693
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,020
It's too dangerous!

694
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,640
The fog.

695
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,880
It's like Silent Hill.

696
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,260
My daughter!

697
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,500
She's all alone!

698
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,100
If we don't do something...

699
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,420
All right.

700
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,380
I get it.

701
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,160
Don't put your hand over his mouth.

702
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,300
He might be infected.

703
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,120
You know...

704
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,180
You know...

705
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:41,140
You know...

706
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,480
We don't know how it spreads, right?

707
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,220
We're making the time.

708
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,080
Okay.

709
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,500
I think people that know the game probably know.

710
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,900
That's true.

711
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,000
Where are you?

712
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,500
We're just dropping right in.

713
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:53,860
Yeah.

714
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,700
We'll figure it out.

715
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,020
We'll figure it out.

716
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,080
Wait, where...

717
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,800
Did that guy leave?

718
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,840
What was that sound?

719
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,180
Yeah.

720
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,720
Oh, he's...

721
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,460
He's brave.

722
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,860
Why'd you run in there?

723
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,620
He's gotta find his daughter.

724
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,020
Oh, God.

725
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,920
That's sad.

726
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,320
Sink jump scare?

727
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,240
Wait, can I...

728
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,100
They're in the vents.

729
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,280
Wait, are they actually?

730
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,560
Thank you?

731
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,480
Oh, gosh.

732
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,700
What are you trying to do?

733
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,440
Aren't they?

734
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
A menu popped up for a second.

735
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,460
Oh.

736
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,940
Let me...

737
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,140
I think I could emote...

738
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,040
You could emote?

739
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,520
Yeah!

740
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,140
For now, I don't know where the menu went.

741
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,520
Leon hitting the gritty.

742
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,220
I am.

743
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,280
Oh, my God.

744
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,740
Oh, sorry, mister.

745
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,160
We're coming.

746
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,200
Who turned the lights off?

747
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,380
The hell?

748
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,600
Why are the lights off?

749
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,660
Oh, it's hard to see.

750
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,600
We have a flashlight?

751
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,320
It is.

752
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,880
Oh, maybe we do have one.

753
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,560
It's like beaming from your eyes.

754
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,920
Oh, like a cat.

755
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,120
Exactly.

756
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,380
There's that guy, though.

757
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, here he is.

758
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,060
Oh!

759
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,100
Is your phone out?

760
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,380
I got my phone out on the side.

761
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,340
I don't know how to put it back in my pocket.

762
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,540
No.

763
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,360
I don't know.

764
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,400
Oh, you're like...

765
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,280
Oh, now I see my phone.

766
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:31,740
Oh.

767
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,200
I think that's the menu.

768
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,640
It shows your inventory and bullets and everything.

769
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,700
Is it just staying forever?

770
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,620
We're about to fight.

771
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,220
Wait, I have no bullets.

772
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, gosh.

773
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,100
We gotta go through here.

774
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,840
Wait, I've got...

775
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,360
I've got bullets, I think.

776
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,540
18 bullets.

777
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,280
You do?

778
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:53,820
Okay.

779
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,840
We'll leave it to you.

780
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,840
You know, I'm allergic to using ammo in these games.

781
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,640
I'm so...

782
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,420
I got my knife out.

783
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,440
Me too.

784
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,540
President?

785
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,300
Oh, it is the president.

786
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,820
Of the United States.

787
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,560
President Adam Benford.

788
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh.

789
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,420
I don't think that's real.

790
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,480
Oh, yeah.

791
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,780
It's AI, everybody.

792
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,220
It's AI.

793
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,260
It's your daddy, please.

794
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,760
The first AI president.

795
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,240
Is she up there?

796
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,280
Who are you looking at, mister?

797
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,020
I'll go check.

798
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,080
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

799
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh, I'm emoting.

800
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,200
I can't emote.

801
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,580
Look.

802
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,040
Wait, how do you do that?

803
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,220
Cold B.

804
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,460
It doesn't work.

805
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,100
Oh, wait.

806
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,520
Mike, I'm on...

807
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,780
You're using controller, right?

808
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,800
Oh, yeah.

809
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,540
Sorry.

810
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,340
No!

811
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,700
I'm sure you've got emotes too.

812
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,780
Somewhere.

813
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,640
Item slot.

814
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,340
Oh, this queue is, like, where I'm supposed to go.

815
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,280
She's, like, beautiful.

816
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,380
He's floating.

817
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,720
I thought they weren't an item.

818
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,180
That's a person.

819
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,740
I can spray them.

820
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,960
There's health right there, yeah.

821
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,160
Oh, wait.

822
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh, no.

823
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,240
I just stole their first aid spray.

824
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,240
Wait, how do I take that?

825
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,040
Oh, I got it.

826
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,320
What did you do?

827
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,040
No.

828
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,840
You caught me in the eyes.

829
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,040
I think you ran into my knife.

830
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,520
You ran into my knife ten times.

831
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,100
It wasn't my fault.

832
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,700
I swear.

833
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,380
I feel bad.

834
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,360
Can we steal the Declaration of Independence?

835
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,780
In here?

836
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,200
This is suddenly...

837
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,460
Uh-oh.

838
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,140
Has he changed already?

839
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:57,660
Oh.

840
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,120
Hold on.

841
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,380
Let me see your eyes, mister.

842
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,120
No, she's here.

843
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,440
Somewhere.

844
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,760
Oh!

845
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,020
Keep getting him!

846
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,600
Don't let him...

847
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,260
Where is this going?

848
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,220
But this is the exit, mister.

849
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,280
Why is she in here?

850
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,640
How do you know?

851
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,920
We'll need to get the elevator working again.

852
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,960
He has...

853
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,080
Fifth sense.

854
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,780
I've got the keys.

855
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,080
Once we're in, we can take my car.

856
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:33,860
Thanks.

857
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Let's find Liz and get the hell out of here.

858
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:38,940
Liz?

859
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,600
Liz, is that you?

860
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,520
Oh, there's a lot of blood, mister.

861
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah.

862
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,040
It's probably a stage prop.

863
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,600
Probably.

864
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
I mean, why else would it be...

865
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,380
Would it be bloody like this?

866
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:52,880
Right?

867
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,700
It's so perfectly, like...

868
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,460
Symmetric.

869
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,000
It is.

870
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,360
Oh, someone's playing the piano.

871
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,120
Whoa.

872
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,120
Are we afraid of lightning?

873
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,080
Why are we...

874
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,900
Why do we go blind?

875
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,440
It's too bright.

876
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,980
Our eyes are not adjusted yet.

877
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,680
I like how sometimes I run, and sometimes I don't.

878
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,880
I know, right?

879
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,280
I don't understand it quite.

880
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,220
Me either.

881
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,060
Careful.

882
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:20,620
Uh-oh.

883
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,220
Uh-oh.

884
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,740
It's a big hand friend.

885
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,220
Are we going in?

886
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,100
I'm going in.

887
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:28,480
Go.

888
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,560
Oh, you need my help.

889
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,740
One, two.

890
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,740
Look at my shoe.

891
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,920
Three, four.

892
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,240
Open the door.

893
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,700
At the door.

894
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,720
I don't have bullets.

895
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,360
Why is it...

896
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,760
Uh-oh.

897
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,300
I did it auto- I don't...

898
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,740
I don't think she's good.

899
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,500
I don't think so either.

900
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,360
She's about to eat him.

901
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,640
Where are mom and Liam?

902
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,660
They...

903
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,060
They already got out.

904
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,480
They're waiting for us at home.

905
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,440
We can move during the cutscene.

906
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,720
Is this going to be like Red Dead Redemption?

907
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,860
where some silly things happen in the background?

908
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,500
Yes.

909
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,740
Oh, they're just leaving.

910
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,540
Okay.

911
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,880
I was going to say.

912
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,460
Everything's big.

913
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,700
Everything's massive.

914
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,320
This is America, baby.

915
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,460
Everything's huge.

916
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,820
How do we get out of this place?

917
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,860
The underground parking lot.

918
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,900
Where'd you go?

919
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,060
I'm stuck on the body.

920
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,540
I'm coming.

921
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,720
Hopefully it still works.

922
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm here.

923
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Walk and run through the halls.

924
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,880
Oop.

925
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,520
What was that?

926
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,400
I don't know.

927
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,560
Oh, just some like 2x4s in here.

928
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,820
This is the skinniest hallway ever.

929
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,060
Why is it so congested?

930
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,280
Let's get this out of our way.

931
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,200
I could...

932
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,140
I would if I could move around this man.

933
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,980
On this?

934
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:05,900
Uh-oh.

935
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,140
Okay.

936
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,700
I'm coming.

937
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,080
I'm coming.

938
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,340
I'm coming.

939
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,920
I can yell at you.

940
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,140
Helena.

941
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,600
Helena.

942
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,420
I'm glad you guys were here.

943
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,060
I don't think she's looking so hot.

944
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,940
Yeah.

945
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,340
Neither is he, though.

946
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,840
You know, maybe they can...

947
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,940
They have asthma together.

948
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,200
Don't you think it's kind of romantic if like 2 people become zombies together and then they're just like wandering?

949
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,100
I think that's his daughter.

950
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:32,680
Zombies forever.

951
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,900
I'm just kidding.

952
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,860
But, you know, in general.

953
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,720
Oh, in general, yeah.

954
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,020
No,

955
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,270
they're me.

956
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:51,930
Daughter me.

957
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:53,910
Familial bomb.

958
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,330
I just think that...

959
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,790
Why are we being so stupid and letting her come with us?

960
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:01,530
Yeah.

961
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,730
Maybe we have confidence.

962
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,930
We can take him out.

963
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,750
Yeah, that's true.

964
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,510
Oh.

965
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,150
Uh-oh.

966
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,290
Oh.

967
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,530
Liz?

968
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,330
Now we're trapped in the elevator with her.

969
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:16,410
Yeah.

970
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,090
Oh.

971
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,870
Oh.

972
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,290
Poor guy.

973
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,410
What a performance.

974
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,430
Uh-oh.

975
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,130
I'm touched.

976
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,490
Oh, no.

977
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,670
In the dark.

978
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,550
Someone's getting chomped on.

979
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,990
Or someone's doing the chomping.

980
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:45,790
Yeah.

981
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,410
It's kind of crazy when they, like, transform.

982
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,810
They become so ugly looking so fast.

983
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,670
Oh my god!

984
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,670
Oh my god, the QT's!

985
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:14,090
I've always wondered, like, how do you tell a fresh zombie from, like, a dirty human who's just been wandering in the apocalypse, you know?

986
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,310
Yeah, that's so true.

987
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,990
Like, I don't think I would be looking my best in the zombie apocalypse.

988
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,550
In 7, there's, like, so much swamp, too, like...

989
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,390
Yeah, yeah, just going through the dirt.

990
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,610
Yeah.

991
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,830
I'm a dirty human.

992
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,510
Mm-hmm.

993
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,150
Uh, is...

994
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,350
I don't think we're alone in here.

995
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:36,670
Oh.

996
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,050
Wait, what do you mean by that?

997
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,190
Lena, grab your gun.

998
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:39,970
In the elevator?

999
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,570
I've got my gun.

1000
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,490
Oh!

1001
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:42,930
Oh!

1002
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,590
Oh my god!

1003
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,010
Oh my god!

1004
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,350
I'm kicking him!

1005
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,190
I'm kicking him!

1006
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:50,830
Kick his ass!

1007
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:51,330
Kick his...

1008
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:51,870
Oh, damn!

1009
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:53,770
Oh, no!

1010
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,790
Kick his ass!

1011
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,870
Is that guy alive this whole time?

1012
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,050
Go, go, go!

1013
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,150
Hell no!

1014
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,210
Oh, I missed.

1015
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,710
Oh, I missed.

1016
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,790
Oh, I missed.

1017
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,450
Is this...

1018
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,630
I love the kicking.

1019
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:11,750
What...

1020
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,810
What is the...

1021
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,230
This is so, like...

1022
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,630
Um...

1023
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,130
What's the word?

1024
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,470
Wait, where's the QT?

1025
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,370
Um...

1026
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:19,910
Left 4 Dead!

1027
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,670
Oh, yeah!

1028
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:22,810
Wait...

1029
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,750
I'm trying to get...

1030
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,190
Yeah!

1031
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,330
Yeah!

1032
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:25,830
Yeah!

1033
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:25,970
Yeah!

1034
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,630
Oh!

1035
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,190
Is there stamina in this?

1036
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,410
Yeah!

1037
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,870
I don't think so.

1038
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,190
I'm tired.

1039
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,550
I think there is.

1040
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,250
I'm tripping over bodies, though.

1041
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:36,690
There are.

1042
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:37,770
Yeah!

1043
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,530
Yeah!

1044
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,630
Wait!

1045
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,610
Where's the QT?

1046
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:41,930
Where's the...

1047
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,510
Symbol that makes me...

1048
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,030
Allowed to...

1049
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,650
I wanna punch him in the face.

1050
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,410
On the ground.

1051
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,450
I can't see anything.

1052
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,190
It's so dark.

1053
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,850
I know it is dark.

1054
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:50,910
Ah!

1055
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,450
N'nish him!

1056
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,830
That's our cue to get the hell out of here.

1057
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,130
Oh!

1058
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,670
Uh-oh.

1059
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,610
Press R?

1060
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:58,810
For what?

1061
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:01,990
Oh, there you are.

1062
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:02,550
Oh!

1063
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,890
R doesn't do anything.

1064
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,510
Which R?

1065
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:06,630
Hmm...

1066
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,710
R bumper...

1067
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,510
Does something for me.

1068
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,390
Oh, R bumper.

1069
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,530
Maybe I should switch to controller.

1070
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,310
I mean, this is a console game originally, right?

1071
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,490
But you do have to aim.

1072
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,370
I know!

1073
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,390
That's why I was like, you know what?

1074
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,130
I'm gonna take it easy.

1075
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,110
Yeah.

1076
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:23,910
Where do we go?

1077
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:24,310
Oh!

1078
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,170
We go over here.

1079
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,070
Yeah, yeah.

1080
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,170
Alaina.

1081
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,730
Don't!

1082
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,250
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1083
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,650
Ha, ha, ha!

1084
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,940
Ha, ha, ha!

1085
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,780
Keep's here yelling.

1086
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,900
It's getting louder.

1087
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,360
It's getting angrier.

1088
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,400
Ha, ha, ha!

1089
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,620
We're in a rush!

1090
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:42,620
Mhm-hm.

1091
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,440
Oh!

1092
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,040
Oh, no!

1093
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,240
Don't scream!

1094
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,160
No, here!

1095
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
Oh, I see- Oh.

1096
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,380
Uh-oh.

1097
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,620
Uh-oh.

1098
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,420
Stop screaming!

1099
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,680
Turn around!

1100
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,580
I have airpods in!

1101
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,620
They can't hear!

1102
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,260
No!

1103
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:58,760
No!

1104
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,880
Take your airpods out!

1105
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,260
Oh my god!

1106
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,400
That became really extreme all of a sudden.

1107
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,060
Leon, it's too late.

1108
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,360
There's nothing we can do.

1109
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,000
Aww.

1110
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,300
He just wants to be a hero.

1111
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,200
Yeah.

1112
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,960
You're right.

1113
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,920
Let's get the hell out of here.

1114
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,500
Where are we going?

1115
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,720
I guess...

1116
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,420
Back to the chapel.

1117
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,340
Yeah, the cathedral.

1118
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,860
Is there anything in here?

1119
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,820
I'm turning my brightness up.

1120
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,980
Me too!

1121
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,580
That's a good idea.

1122
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,280
Oh my gosh.

1123
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,260
Camera settings?

1124
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,340
Camera settings?

1125
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,940
I'm turning it all the way up.

1126
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,320
It said like...

1127
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,640
Make it so that the 6 is barely visible.

1128
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,060
But I had it really visible.

1129
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,520
Me too!

1130
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,700
I had it really visible.

1131
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,280
And it's still too dark.

1132
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,280
Graphics settings?

1133
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,480
No.

1134
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,120
Where did you find it under?

1135
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,180
Screen settings?

1136
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:13,980
Oh, here we go.

1137
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,480
It's in screen settings.

1138
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,360
Let's just turn it up to like...

1139
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,860
35, everybody.

1140
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,720
Crazy.

1141
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,080
Oh, finally I can see.

1142
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,040
I know.

1143
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,500
Is it going to be really bright when we go outside?

1144
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,600
I feel like they just want you to make it dark.

1145
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,420
Because the graphics are bad.

1146
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,280
And so you can't see how bad the graphics are.

1147
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,840
No, it's supposed to be spooky.

1148
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,020
He said it was some sort of fog.

1149
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,060
The fog.

1150
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,920
This thing spread in gas form.

1151
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,220
And anyone who breathed it in got infected.

1152
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,440
Uh-oh.

1153
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,460
This looks like fog.

1154
00:41:59,460 --> 00:41:59,980
Uh-oh.

1155
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,420
I know.

1156
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,320
Are we in trouble?

1157
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:02,820
Yeah.

1158
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,060
But then why is it so quiet?

1159
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,320
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1160
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:07,800
Hmm.

1161
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,280
Okay, I got my shotgun out.

1162
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,720
You have a shotgun?

1163
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,920
Yeah, baby.

1164
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,540
Did you find one?

1165
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,760
I don't know.

1166
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,700
Did you start with one?

1167
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,040
Maybe I started with it.

1168
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,180
I don't remember picking it up, so...

1169
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,260
Ooh.

1170
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,080
The lecture hall?

1171
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,960
This is nice.

1172
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,600
This is nice.

1173
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,260
Like academia?

1174
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,840
It's so...

1175
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,100
Like, it already looks so worn down.

1176
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,980
How did this happen, like, within the span of...

1177
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,140
Yeah, that's true.

1178
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,860
Uh-oh.

1179
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,180
This guy, this guy did it all.

1180
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:48,200
Sorry.

1181
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,760
Didn't really do that.

1182
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,260
He's like, my lesson.

1183
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,500
Come on.

1184
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,460
Oh, there's multiple.

1185
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,540
Didn't you hear, Bunny?

1186
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,860
If the professor is 15 minutes late, you're legally allowed to...

1187
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,660
Whoa!

1188
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,040
Whoa!

1189
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,820
That guy just disintegrated.

1190
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,200
I don't know how many bullets I have, though.

1191
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,560
Oh, I...

1192
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:07,820
I'll go...

1193
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,980
I'll go kick him.

1194
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:09,820
Yeah!

1195
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,600
Yeah!

1196
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,520
You got him!

1197
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,420
Yeah!

1198
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,580
Wait, what is this?

1199
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,600
Skill points.

1200
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,940
Oh, you can get skill points from the guys that you defeat.

1201
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,660
There's skill points?

1202
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,160
Oh!

1203
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,340
Oh, there's a guy here, too?

1204
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,460
Oh, I've got ammo.

1205
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:29,960
Good job.

1206
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,360
Nice.

1207
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,520
Wait, which way?

1208
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,860
This...

1209
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,660
I can't tell which...

1210
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,540
Where the door is.

1211
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:38,860
This one?

1212
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,800
Over here?

1213
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,240
Oh, you got him.

1214
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,780
I wanted to yell again.

1215
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,580
Elena!

1216
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,220
Elena!

1217
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,140
Does this work?

1218
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,020
No.

1219
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,220
No.

1220
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:56,620
Oh, I should.

1221
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,960
Are you in a cut scene?

1222
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,500
No, are you?

1223
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,920
I...

1224
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,480
I just saw a big...

1225
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,200
The big area out there.

1226
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,260
That's all it showed me.

1227
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,220
Okay.

1228
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,300
I guess it's like, you need to go there.

1229
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,500
Or something.

1230
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:14,980
Okay.

1231
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,240
Wait, can I yell at you?

1232
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,220
Oh

1233
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,920
my god!

1234
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,820
Crazy!

1235
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,500
Can you lock on?

1236
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,440
I know, right?

1237
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:38,680
I know, right?

1238
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,040
It's so awesome.

1239
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,660
Oh my god!

1240
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,700
This is awesome.

1241
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,300
Yeah!

1242
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,920
I don't know.

1243
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,220
I like the little cans of like, soda everywhere and stuff.

1244
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,660
Yeah.

1245
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,800
Wait, there was something?

1246
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,040
Oh.

1247
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,400
What's going on there?

1248
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,580
I'm just role playing like I'm Sanji from One Piece.

1249
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:06,920
Oh!

1250
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:07,860
We don't need...

1251
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,820
Where my mind is right now.

1252
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,860
We don't need guns.

1253
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,880
Wait, do I have...

1254
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,060
Oh, I only have my...

1255
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,960
I don't have a...

1256
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,120
A knife.

1257
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:14,640
Dang.

1258
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,940
There's an herb over here.

1259
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,840
You don't have a knife?

1260
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,360
No!

1261
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,000
Just my fists.

1262
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,000
There's an herb.

1263
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,140
Oh!

1264
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,700
Green herb.

1265
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,260
Nice.

1266
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,860
Green herb.

1267
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,100
The Capcom store sells like...

1268
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,820
Little like tea bags that's supposed to be the healing herbs.

1269
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,880
Does it?

1270
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,040
Yeah, it's really cute.

1271
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,300
I wanna try it.

1272
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,200
Oh wait, there's another door on the other side, I think.

1273
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,580
Oh, in here?

1274
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,020
Mm-hmm.

1275
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,380
I see that guy laying...

1276
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:44,780
Chilling there.

1277
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,040
Stab him!

1278
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,520
He just wanted...

1279
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,560
A Coca-Cola.

1280
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,160
You got this!

1281
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:50,540
Yeah!

1282
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,640
Get him!

1283
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1284
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,680
I can't reach him.

1285
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,100
Yeah, get his...

1286
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,220
Yeah!

1287
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,380
I defeated him.

1288
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,180
He didn't move though.

1289
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,780
He did.

1290
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,540
He did!

1291
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,080
He did!

1292
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:11,600
Yeah.

1293
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,500
He doesn't wanna be disturbed.

1294
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,080
He's taking a fine little nap.

1295
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,680
I wonder if there are any survivors.

1296
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,400
Oh, he saw some.

1297
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:20,900
They...

1298
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,700
They didn't last very long.

1299
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:23,400
Uh-oh.

1300
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,660
Yeah.

1301
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,520
Oh!

1302
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,800
Get him!

1303
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,200
Yeah!

1304
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:28,740
Oh!

1305
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,120
Oh, damn.

1306
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,840
He's slicing him.

1307
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,200
Yeah.

1308
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,380
Uh-oh.

1309
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,240
I got her.

1310
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,060
No, I don't.

1311
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes, I do.

1312
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,600
Oh!

1313
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,620
Teamwork!

1314
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah!

1315
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,140
That was good!

1316
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,020
Wait, there's so much ammo.

1317
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,620
Oh, wait.

1318
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,700
I did get skills.

1319
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,540
If you get...

1320
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,100
Skills.

1321
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,440
Skills.

1322
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,640
I don't have a skill to equip.

1323
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,740
Oh, me neither.

1324
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
Do we have to buy a skill?

1325
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,020
I don't know.

1326
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,220
Kick and shank.

1327
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,000
I was always scared of these games because it always was like, the ammo is so limited.

1328
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,660
But if you can just shank everyone, I think it's fine.

1329
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:13,980
Yeah.

1330
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,320
Until the zombies will only die after you kick them 400 times.

1331
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:22,900
That's true.

1332
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,360
Oh.

1333
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,900
Oh, I kicked him twice and that's all I needed.

1334
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,140
What's a Resident Evil?

1335
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,320
These guys seem weak.

1336
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:36,200
I know in Resident Evil 7 though, the zombies get so strong.

1337
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,060
They take like 20 bullets to kill.

1338
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:39,520
Ew!

1339
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,060
No!

1340
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,600
I know.

1341
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,520
That's what I needed.

1342
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,860
Wait, there's a room over here.

1343
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,500
Oh, I think I'm hurt.

1344
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,280
Wait.

1345
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:50,840
How?

1346
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,840
Who are you?

1347
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,400
QTE!

1348
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,100
QTE!

1349
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,380
I tripped over that guy.

1350
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,520
I actually tripped over him.

1351
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,360
Oh no.

1352
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,680
Where'd they come from?

1353
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,540
I don't know.

1354
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,760
Nasty suckers.

1355
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,860
Getting skill points.

1356
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,180
Oh, there's grenades here.

1357
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,740
Nice.

1358
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,860
Is this a different room?

1359
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:24,540
I guess so.

1360
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,740
Everything looks the same.

1361
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,140
Would these guys be naplings because they're all sleeping?

1362
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:30,720
Yes.

1363
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,000
They're like Nemi Nightmare.

1364
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,760
They're dreaming for me.

1365
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,620
I'm sure they're having horrible nightmares.

1366
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,200
That's good though.

1367
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,300
That's what you want to eat, right?

1368
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:44,600
Yeah.

1369
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,720
It is.

1370
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,460
I'm right here!

1371
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,200
I tried opening the door.

1372
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:54,980
Christmas.

1373
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,000
Get to the security gate.

1374
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,280
It'll lead you off the campus.

1375
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,060
Okay.

1376
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,840
So nice.

1377
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,520
Yeah.

1378
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,420
A little party.

1379
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh!

1380
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,600
This one's got a weapon.

1381
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,680
Oh!

1382
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:12,540
Yeah!

1383
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,000
Nice!

1384
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,820
I like when we double up.

1385
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,340
It's good.

1386
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,260
Of course, big sushi rolls.

1387
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,860
Oh my God!

1388
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,600
Huge!

1389
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,820
This is America.

1390
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,180
This is actually what America is like, everybody.

1391
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,580
If you've never...

1392
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
It's very true.

1393
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,560
Yeah.

1394
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,520
If you've never been.

1395
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,760
If you're not American.

1396
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:36,920
One second.

1397
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,660
I'm trying.

1398
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,260
There's an attempt.

1399
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,120
You're succeeding.

1400
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,650
Zombies are just having a nice time.

1401
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,790
They haven't touched their sushi though.

1402
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,390
On a plunge hammer.

1403
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,810
Oh my God!

1404
00:49:59,210 --> 00:49:59,910
Oh my God!

1405
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,630
Holy cow!

1406
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:03,690
Can we take it?

1407
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,130
I know!

1408
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,510
Oh, did you take it?

1409
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:08,730
Oh, I think it's here now.

1410
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:09,990
Oh, you got it!

1411
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:10,650
Or...

1412
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:10,990
I did?

1413
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:11,730
Or...

1414
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,450
It disappeared once you walked over it.

1415
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,210
Disappeared.

1416
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:16,850
Wait, can I disrupt the sushi?

1417
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,110
Or a red herb?

1418
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:20,870
Or a red herb?

1419
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,410
Wait, somebody's gonna wanna eat it now.

1420
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,910
It's got my butt germs all over it.

1421
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,210
No, maybe...

1422
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,250
Maybe that makes it better.

1423
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,150
There's...

1424
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,650
Green herb too.

1425
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,350
Green.

1426
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,250
Wait, I'm trying to grab the herb.

1427
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,990
Oh, I can't?

1428
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:37,910
Maybe I'm full.

1429
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,990
Oh my gosh, I saw somebody...

1430
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,170
Who got the omurice...

1431
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,390
And they asked for a wisp...

1432
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:46,670
To be drawn...

1433
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,090
Oh my God!

1434
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:47,950
My butt!

1435
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,570
They drew your butt on it instead!

1436
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,970
I'm...

1437
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,950
I'm surprised they were allowed to do that.

1438
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,050
I know!

1439
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,130
I was impressed with the...

1440
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,290
The...

1441
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,690
Cafe Maid's drawing skill too.

1442
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,090
It was impressive.

1443
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,630
Nice.

1444
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,910
Yeah, it was really accurate.

1445
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:10,490
What?

1446
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:14,290
This guy's also got a bottle.

1447
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,150
You've been hittin' the bottle too much lately, buddy.

1448
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,510
Take it easy.

1449
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,450
That's for sure.

1450
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:28,150
I wonder what the weirdest request that these maids get...

1451
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,270
I know, right?

1452
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,290
On the omurices.

1453
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,310
Sorry, not from here.

1454
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,970
Try the staff building behind the bleachers.

1455
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,830
I'm guessing you'll find keys for the gate there.

1456
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,490
I need to mix herbs to make space.

1457
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:40,890
Oh!

1458
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,810
Wait, how do I do that?

1459
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,270
Okay.

1460
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,370
It's definitely in the tutorial and I definitely don't remember.

1461
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,030
I'm combining...

1462
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,030
I'm mixing...

1463
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,730
Herbs.

1464
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:52,710
Oh, like this.

1465
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:53,730
Okay.

1466
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:54,490
Combine.

1467
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:55,050
Oh.

1468
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,470
I've combined.

1469
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,030
Okay, wait.

1470
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,770
Now I can go get more.

1471
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,550
They look...

1472
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,610
They look weird.

1473
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,330
Yeah.

1474
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:06,890
Herb.

1475
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,430
Crab.

1476
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:08,870
Okay.

1477
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,430
Now if I mix it again...

1478
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:18,150
I can see you running around in the back.

1479
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,650
What was it behind the bleachers, she said?

1480
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,330
Oh, over here.

1481
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:26,290
I don't know.

1482
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,810
Wait, is this the bleachers?

1483
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,630
Well, there's always like a little direction, which is kind of nice.

1484
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,470
Keep that trigger finger ready.

1485
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,730
I know.

1486
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,310
This is a very head empty game.

1487
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,230
It really is.

1488
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,550
Run to the next point on the map.

1489
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,490
This guy...

1490
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,650
This guy is definitely alive.

1491
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,470
He really wants me to spray you.

1492
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:46,890
Am I hurt?

1493
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:47,890
How can I tell?

1494
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:48,550
I don't know.

1495
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,710
I'm gonna spray you.

1496
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,890
You need some...

1497
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,750
It's a body spray.

1498
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:53,870
I'm staying.

1499
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,010
I'm stanky.

1500
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:56,990
Oh my gosh.

1501
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:57,850
They're playing football.

1502
00:52:58,890 --> 00:52:59,930
Oh, they are.

1503
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:00,490
Go team.

1504
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,270
They live in their college dreams.

1505
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,670
Oh, did you ever play...

1506
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,510
The...

1507
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,730
Card shop simulator?

1508
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,430
No, I didn't.

1509
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:11,290
Oh.

1510
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,350
In that game, you can spray people with deodorant.

1511
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,090
No way.

1512
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:15,370
Really?

1513
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,370
Yes.

1514
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,030
People come into your store stinky.

1515
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,390
Oh my gosh.

1516
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,490
You can spray them with deodorant.

1517
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:24,990
Wait, will she yell at you?

1518
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:25,810
How do I yell?

1519
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:26,670
Push B.

1520
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,310
I don't know what B is for you.

1521
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:29,330
I'm pressing everything.

1522
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:32,230
Lay on.

1523
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,350
Oh, I got it.

1524
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,730
Hurry up.

1525
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:37,810
Lay on.

1526
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:39,250
Hurry up.

1527
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:40,910
Uh oh.

1528
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,870
Why did she just press buttons?

1529
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,650
This is like me...

1530
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,250
Trying to go into my grandparents' house.

1531
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:50,230
The door's locked.

1532
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:50,530
Why?

1533
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,350
There's no way out.

1534
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,710
They always have the security system armed.

1535
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:55,090
And I never know the password.

1536
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,250
And they're always like, Don't worry.

1537
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:56,650
Oh my god.

1538
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:58,650
Just turn the alarm on and then...

1539
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,850
And I want my knife.

1540
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:02,990
Get your knife out.

1541
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,530
It's knife in time.

1542
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,470
Oh my god.

1543
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,710
That lady's clipping through the...

1544
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:07,330
You can't take them all.

1545
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,270
Now we know all of them.

1546
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,700
I think this works.

1547
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:14,880
Oh.

1548
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:15,620
Yeah.

1549
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,070
Grab my skill points.

1550
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,090
Nice.

1551
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:21,590
Attack.

1552
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:22,110
Oh.

1553
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,370
There's so many guys.

1554
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,050
That guy was behind me and just didn't do anything.

1555
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,250
Come on, guy.

1556
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,050
This is a pretty tight security for a college campus.

1557
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:34,490
Oh, there's more.

1558
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:35,130
Yup.

1559
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,330
Take them out.

1560
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,630
Of course, there's so many.

1561
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,470
They're playing football.

1562
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,750
I think I'm hurt.

1563
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:43,930
I think I'm hurt.

1564
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,690
There's a melee point.

1565
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,990
Melee skill.

1566
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:47,530
Ah!

1567
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,270
Oh no!

1568
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:50,890
What?

1569
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:55,900
You know what?

1570
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,560
I'm just gonna start using my gun.

1571
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:57,780
Uh-oh.

1572
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:58,620
Ouch!

1573
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,040
Hey!

1574
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,680
I've almost got it.

1575
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,180
Hang on.

1576
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,680
Uh-oh.

1577
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,540
Uh-oh.

1578
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,980
Is this, uh, like, your objective?

1579
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,340
Is this to survive?

1580
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:11,840
Uh-huh.

1581
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,520
I think so.

1582
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,800
Oh, I see where my health is now.

1583
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,340
I think.

1584
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,260
I think.

1585
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,140
Where is your health?

1586
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,020
I think it's the little squares.

1587
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,520
It's open!

1588
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,260
Get out of there!

1589
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,640
Now!

1590
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,360
Go!

1591
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,720
Go!

1592
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,080
Go!

1593
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,870
Uh...

1594
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,610
Hello, sir?

1595
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,830
You might wanna...

1596
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,190
Oh, he's...

1597
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,450
He's done for.

1598
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,170
There's some bullets here, though.

1599
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,570
Oh, there's a PC!

1600
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,630
Are we gaming?

1601
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:56,810
Are we gaming?

1602
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,070
Yeah!

1603
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,610
Let's play Minesweeper!

1604
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,130
Minesweeper!

1605
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,170
I've never been good at that game.

1606
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,190
Like, I know...

1607
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:04,650
Me neither!

1608
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:06,010
I know the...

1609
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:06,770
The...

1610
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,710
The...

1611
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:08,810
The...

1612
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,270
The strat, but I don't know.

1613
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,970
Oh, there's this, like...

1614
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,690
Sometimes it's just luck, right?

1615
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:15,710
I don't...

1616
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,610
I think there's actually a strat, though.

1617
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,490
I mean, you're not just supposed to click the boxes randomly.

1618
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,080
What about the first one, though?

1619
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,700
The first one is always luck.

1620
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,740
That's true.

1621
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,380
That's true.

1622
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,840
You can just get unlucky.

1623
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:36,680
Oh!

1624
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,820
What the heck is this?

1625
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,760
Whoa, what is that?

1626
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,900
Sigil!

1627
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,820
That looks important!

1628
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,720
Can we take it?

1629
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,000
It's, like, glowing and everything.

1630
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,780
There's the...

1631
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,520
To look at.

1632
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,800
Smash it?

1633
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,860
Oh!

1634
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,400
Perfect symbol!

1635
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,720
Oh, I think there is stamina.

1636
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,020
I see it, actually.

1637
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:06,980
Come on.

1638
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,500
So impatient, Leon Kennedy.

1639
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,700
Oh, the key card.

1640
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,900
I knew that was gonna happen.

1641
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,120
I knew it!

1642
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,520
Oh, no, no, no!

1643
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,060
Are you alive?

1644
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,120
Yeah, I'm okay.

1645
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,160
Okay.

1646
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,840
I knew that was gonna happen.

1647
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,900
I looked around.

1648
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,280
I turned around exactly to see it happen.

1649
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,140
What about you, lady?

1650
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:33,900
Ah!

1651
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,600
I knew it!

1652
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,700
So they were...

1653
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,540
Resting.

1654
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,080
Chilling.

1655
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,840
They were just showing off their...

1656
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,020
Oh, wait.

1657
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,000
My health is bad.

1658
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,020
You need some Axe Body Spray?

1659
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,340
I'm gonna spray my...

1660
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,460
The tutorial did not teach me how to...

1661
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,680
Spray myself.

1662
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,300
Herb.

1663
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,400
Does it show you on your little HUD?

1664
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:03,900
I think if I...

1665
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,360
It says red bumper for me.

1666
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:06,540
I think.

1667
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,980
I have to equip it, I think.

1668
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,000
And then if I equip it...

1669
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,740
Wait, huh?

1670
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,480
I have to press one.

1671
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,200
Oh!

1672
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,560
Okay, I'm good to go!

1673
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,080
Oh.

1674
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,340
It was like a little mint.

1675
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,580
Why is it all deodorant and mint?

1676
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,060
I'm so...

1677
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,340
Yeah, I'm so fresh now.

1678
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,200
Whoa!

1679
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:30,880
YB!

1680
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,260
Why?

1681
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,380
They hate you.

1682
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,420
What's their problem?

1683
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,480
Because I'm smelling so good.

1684
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,200
Yeah.

1685
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,760
Oh.

1686
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
What the hell did I just do?

1687
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,800
Who opened this door?

1688
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,460
They must have opened it.

1689
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,840
That's suspicious.

1690
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,580
Just keep beating him up.

1691
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,660
We're just bullying him.

1692
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,780
Yeah, we really are.

1693
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,420
Oh, that's not...

1694
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:06,680
Whoa!

1695
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:07,520
Whoa!

1696
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:08,440
Whoa!

1697
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,060
Whoa, you're tough.

1698
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,060
Oh, shoot.

1699
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,980
Leon's a hero.

1700
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,120
Big cool hero.

1701
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,300
Big cool hero!

1702
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,060
Big cool hero!

1703
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,100
Oh, you dead?

1704
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,660
I'm good, I'm good.

1705
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:26,590
But there's skill points here.

1706
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,170
I know, I wanna use them.

1707
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,070
And I don't know what they're for, but...

1708
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,210
They're like, tic-tac.

1709
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:33,850
Hi!

1710
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,740
You did it.

1711
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,460
You did it, Leon.

1712
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,520
We took care of all these guys.

1713
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,400
Where'd they come from?

1714
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:47,880
Whoa!

1715
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:48,640
You can see...

1716
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,420
Check them.

1717
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,240
That's awesome.

1718
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,020
Oh!

1719
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:55,880
Hey, lady.

1720
00:59:58,960 --> 00:59:59,520
See?

1721
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:01,940
Ouch!

1722
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:02,820
Whoa!

1723
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,160
Where'd she go?

1724
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:05,760
Oh, there she is.

1725
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,920
I think if I just...

1726
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,540
If I just go and unlock it, I think it's fine.

1727
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:12,600
Yeah.

1728
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,300
Maybe?

1729
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,000
Wait.

1730
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,840
You got this!

1731
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:19,900
Yeah!

1732
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,180
Yeah!

1733
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,640
I'm addicted to the sneak attacks.

1734
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,400
Oh.

1735
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,700
Maybe you could get that guy.

1736
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,540
I think he knows where we are, though.

1737
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,040
It's okay.

1738
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,180
They're dumb.

1739
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,480
I'll... I'll distract them.

1740
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,280
Whoa!

1741
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,240
This is just that easy.

1742
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,680
Just that easy.

1743
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,380
If I press... Oh, if I press one...

1744
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:48,940
Oh, okay, okay.

1745
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,320
Elena.

1746
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,460
Oh, my God.

1747
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,180
You were zooming around me.

1748
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,070
Very cool.

1749
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,590
Leon's got moves.

1750
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:03,630
Wait, can I slide on this?

1751
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:03,870
No?

1752
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:04,950
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1753
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:05,730
I wanna go through.

1754
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:06,170
Yeah.

1755
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:07,330
Uh-oh.

1756
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,370
I feel like it's gonna beep.

1757
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:10,750
Yeah, probably.

1758
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:11,870
It's gonna beep.

1759
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:12,390
I would hope so.

1760
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,270
It's gonna sound the guards.

1761
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:14,350
The guards.

1762
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,000
Come on, Leon.

1763
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,660
He skipped arm day.

1764
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:44,730
Should've known.

1765
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,270
Oh, it actually did go on.

1766
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,330
I knew it!

1767
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,170
Why is it...

1768
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,430
I guess the power's still on, huh?

1769
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,850
Go, go, go!

1770
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:53,930
No!

1771
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:57,810
Oh, nice.

1772
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,660
Oh, there was something there, though.

1773
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:09,860
Uh-oh.

1774
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,140
Tickle right up ahead.

1775
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,800
You're almost there.

1776
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,440
Keep running!

1777
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,920
Oh, keep running, she said.

1778
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:16,780
Keep running!

1779
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:16,900
Okay.

1780
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:17,380
Oh.

1781
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:18,940
Ah!

1782
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,100
Ah!

1783
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:20,460
Whoa!

1784
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,280
Oh, God.

1785
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:22,940
Run!

1786
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,500
Oh, my God.

1787
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,380
It's crazy here.

1788
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,300
I'm going, I'm going!

1789
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,820
Just run!

1790
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,780
Run past the police!

1791
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:30,920
Oh, my gosh.

1792
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,480
Oh.

1793
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,300
I don't know where...

1794
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,000
Are we even flying?

1795
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,740
I think you are!

1796
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,360
Oh, you're here.

1797
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,520
Wait, am I?

1798
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:39,900
No keys?

1799
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,660
I'm moving the stick.

1800
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,500
Wait, I think you're, like, talking to me, but I'm not in the car.

1801
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,220
Get in the car!

1802
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,140
Should we hotwire it?

1803
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,620
Hotwire it!

1804
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,720
Are you in?

1805
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,240
Ah!

1806
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,460
I'm about to leave!

1807
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,480
Yeah, I think I'm in the...

1808
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,600
It's clear behind us.

1809
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,160
Back up!

1810
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,840
It is not clear behind.

1811
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,520
No.

1812
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:08,680
Oh, my God.

1813
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,220
Rebuckle in?

1814
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:09,920
Oh.

1815
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:10,340
Yeah.

1816
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,140
Does that matter right now?

1817
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,180
I don't have my license.

1818
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:17,900
It matters.

1819
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,500
You want to be buckled up.

1820
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,300
Leon, freshly 16.

1821
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,460
Without getting killed.

1822
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,020
Oh!

1823
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,880
That's not good.

1824
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,460
She barely made it out.

1825
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,240
We made, like, two feet before we crashed.

1826
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,040
I know!

1827
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,140
No!

1828
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,720
Leon, Helena, are you two all right?

1829
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,620
I'm hanging in there.

1830
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,120
Barely.

1831
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:53,600
Yeah, barely.

1832
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,800
Are we going in the sewers?

1833
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,940
I found an underground room that may be safer.

1834
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,260
In the sewers, huh?

1835
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:00,440
Great.

1836
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,300
Time to go... How do we get in?

1837
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:03,520
Oh.

1838
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,740
Oh.

1839
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,200
Oh, Jesus.

1840
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:14,780
This game is so...

1841
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,480
This is awesome.

1842
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,180
I know.

1843
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,800
Having so much fun.

1844
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,170
Oh.

1845
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:24,530
Whoa!

1846
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:25,130
Oh!

1847
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,510
I thought you guys said nothing was going on!

1848
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,230
Is it an unrequited love?

1849
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,150
Does she like him?

1850
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:33,630
Oh, no.

1851
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:34,590
He doesn't like her.

1852
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:41,510
I feel like it's rude for him to shine his light directly into her eyes like that.

1853
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:51,330
I think there's alligators down here?

1854
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,230
Oh, yeah.

1855
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,530
Oh, he's...

1856
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,810
Oh, God, he's hallucinating.

1857
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,890
What is...

1858
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:58,870
Mr. President!

1859
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,030
The desire to reveal the truth.

1860
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,470
I know where they're coming...

1861
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,610
There is actually alligators in the...

1862
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,750
In the sewers, though.

1863
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:12,430
In, like, Florida?

1864
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:12,890
In, like, Florida?

1865
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,950
Really?

1866
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:15,790
Or everywhere.

1867
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:17,910
What do you mean?

1868
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,090
I think so.

1869
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:27,090
I think there are alligators everywhere in Florida.

1870
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,210
Like, in your pool?

1871
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,070
In your backyard?

1872
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,850
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1873
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,430
I'm sure they're in the sewers, too.

1874
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,730
I'm right behind you.

1875
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,730
And we won't have any chance of fighting this.

1876
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,610
In your bathtub?

1877
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:42,850
Crawling up your toilet?

1878
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:45,270
I heard that things can do that.

1879
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,790
Yeah, like snakes and stuff?

1880
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:47,430
Yeah.

1881
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,350
It's time we take responsibility.

1882
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,870
And end this mess.

1883
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,770
This is the real romance.

1884
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,130
He's such an emo boy with his hair.

1885
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:03,510
Yes.

1886
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:11,860
Let's get moving.

1887
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,320
We don't have much time.

1888
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,380
Mr. President.

1889
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,240
We certainly got our work cut out for us.

1890
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:17,840
Believe me.

1891
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,680
I mean, did you see how they were looking at each other?

1892
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,140
I know.

1893
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:20,160
I know.

1894
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,000
Ugh.

1895
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:23,980
This is gross.

1896
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,900
Can I walk in it?

1897
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:25,440
Okay, yeah.

1898
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,380
You.

1899
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,040
Now you really need the ass.

1900
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,100
Yeah, I need the spray.

1901
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,720
Look at the cute little rat.

1902
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:33,400
Look at him.

1903
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,260
It is cute.

1904
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,740
Oh, he's really scampering.

1905
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,680
He's scampering.

1906
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,580
Can I go in here?

1907
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:43,980
He's cute.

1908
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:44,760
He is pretty cute.

1909
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,820
They really modeled the rat.

1910
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,120
It's not just like a polygon.

1911
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,380
There's a dodge?

1912
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:49,300
Oh my god.

1913
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,200
Wait.

1914
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,260
There's a dodge?

1915
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:51,700
Yeah.

1916
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,200
How?

1917
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,300
Oh, shoot.

1918
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,680
I'm popping my breath mint.

1919
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:06,650
I don't know how to dodge.

1920
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:07,350
That's okay.

1921
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,010
Oh.

1922
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,410
More rats.

1923
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,030
Oh, this doesn't look safe.

1924
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:20,830
Oh, that's gonna...

1925
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:21,190
Yeah.

1926
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,830
That doesn't look great.

1927
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,250
There can't be zombies down here.

1928
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,190
Why would there be people?

1929
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:28,250
Yeah.

1930
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:29,430
But there...

1931
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:30,030
There will be.

1932
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:31,310
But...

1933
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,010
They're fast.

1934
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,250
Why are they so fast?

1935
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,250
Oh.

1936
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,150
Oh my god.

1937
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,050
Are you good?

1938
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,630
Okay.

1939
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:40,270
Okay.

1940
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,610
A caillou came running at us.

1941
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:49,770
When did I switch guns?

1942
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:50,270
There we go.

1943
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,360
When can we learn skills?

1944
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,160
I know.

1945
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,040
Wait.

1946
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:57,540
Can you...

1947
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,160
Have you tried yet?

1948
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,140
Yeah.

1949
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:00,960
I don't know.

1950
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:03,640
Do we have to go to the skill shop or something?

1951
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,260
What are you buying?

1952
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,220
It's the only guy I know.

1953
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,340
I think he's from four.

1954
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,080
What are you selling?

1955
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:10,920
Oh.

1956
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:12,700
Oh.

1957
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,080
Oh.

1958
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:13,200
Oh.

1959
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,300
I got you.

1960
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,240
Thank you.

1961
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,700
You saved me.

1962
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:19,900
Uh-oh.

1963
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:20,280
Oh.

1964
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,420
There's a lot of guys now.

1965
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,700
I'm ready to sneak attack them.

1966
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:25,220
Oh.

1967
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,060
That was so close.

1968
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,400
Can I sneak attack them?

1969
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:30,780
Oh.

1970
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,020
He's about to get behind him.

1971
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:32,820
Oh.

1972
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:33,780
The train was coming.

1973
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,820
Oh my god.

1974
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,440
I threw.

1975
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,440
I think I died.

1976
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,920
I panicked and pushed all the buttons.

1977
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,360
Oh no.

1978
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,620
Your partner died.

1979
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,060
We both died.

1980
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,460
Or did you get out of the way?

1981
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:51,400
No.

1982
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,580
I died for sure.

1983
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah.

1984
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,800
I didn't know the train.

1985
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,040
Who was running the train?

1986
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,320
Yeah.

1987
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,380
That was crazy.

1988
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:01,540
Oh.

1989
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,460
Nice.

1990
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,060
I guess just stay on the sides then.

1991
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:07,300
Yeah.

1992
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,100
I'm ready for the QTE.

1993
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,900
I didn't even have a QTE that came up.

1994
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,700
You didn't?

1995
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,080
No.

1996
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,600
It's here.

1997
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,280
Oh no.

1998
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,400
A space art.

1999
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,540
I thought it would be the same QTE as last time.

2000
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:33,660
Leon.

2001
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:36,900
That's okay.

2002
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,940
Third time's a charm.

2003
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:39,560
Oh no.

2004
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:39,980
Come here.

2005
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:40,560
Come here, buddy.

2006
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,100
Oh.

2007
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:43,260
Dang.

2008
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:46,460
I got my ass.

2009
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,320
Is the train just gonna come?

2010
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,080
No matter what.

2011
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:51,400
Ouch.

2012
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:51,960
Ouch.

2013
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:53,260
Uh-oh.

2014
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,320
Uh-oh.

2015
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,020
Train's coming.

2016
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:55,720
Train's coming.

2017
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,100
Okay.

2018
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:58,920
I pushed it.

2019
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,420
You got it.

2020
01:09:59,500 --> 01:09:59,960
You got it.

2021
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,500
You got it.

2022
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,880
It probably killed all the guys though, right?

2023
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:04,580
Yeah.

2024
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,180
Oh.

2025
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:05,840
Oh gosh.

2026
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:06,180
Come on.

2027
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,280
I know QTE's too.

2028
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,060
No.

2029
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,300
He's owning us.

2030
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,820
I know this one guy is so...

2031
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,680
Oh my gosh.

2032
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:24,160
Why didn't he get got by the train?

2033
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,960
He knows QTE's too.

2034
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,640
He's comboing us.

2035
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,280
Mm-hmm.

2036
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,740
Mm-hmm.

2037
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:36,700
Oh.

2038
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,400
What's going...

2039
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,060
Is that a dog?

2040
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:41,680
The dog?

2041
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:42,320
Oh no.

2042
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,380
Not the dogs.

2043
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,320
Oh no.

2044
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,360
Does the dog make that sound?

2045
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,320
I think that he was eating a person.

2046
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,340
Oh.

2047
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,900
I'm gonna blast him.

2048
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,120
Oh.

2049
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,060
I took care of him.

2050
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,180
Oh, it's so sad when they make the dog move.

2051
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:01,680
Oh, I know.

2052
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,140
Why do you have to do that?

2053
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,080
I know.

2054
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:04,800
Oh.

2055
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:05,560
Oh no.

2056
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,540
I got you.

2057
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,640
Oh, you got him.

2058
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,690
Dogs are fast.

2059
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,370
Oh, why is it so...

2060
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,270
Oh gosh.

2061
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:16,070
Oh, ow.

2062
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:16,790
What's happening to me?

2063
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:17,110
What?

2064
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:17,690
Oh gosh.

2065
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,110
More dogs.

2066
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,770
More dogs.

2067
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,130
I'm spraying.

2068
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:23,310
I didn't need to do that.

2069
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,470
Are you okay?

2070
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,330
I'm trying to kick the dog in.

2071
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:33,530
They're too low.

2072
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,150
Yeah.

2073
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,950
For being enraged with my knife.

2074
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:38,610
Maybe...

2075
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,470
Maybe I should use my gun.

2076
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,530
I don't even know how the...

2077
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,050
My heals came out.

2078
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:45,010
I don't know how that happened.

2079
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:46,350
I don't...

2080
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,030
I didn't press any...

2081
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,570
Maybe...

2082
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,350
What did I press?

2083
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,910
Oh, caps lock does that.

2084
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:52,890
Okay.

2085
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:53,430
Yeah.

2086
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:55,650
Interesting.

2087
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,870
The tutorial didn't teach anything.

2088
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:00,730
It really didn't.

2089
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,530
Oh, there's two people wrestling over here.

2090
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:04,570
Okay.

2091
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,010
Okay.

2092
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:05,610
I can save them!

2093
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:06,830
Oops.

2094
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:11,810
The train!

2095
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:13,670
Oh no!

2096
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:20,540
Oh no!

2097
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,320
I don't know where...

2098
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,380
I don't know where...

2099
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:30,780
It's okay.

2100
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:31,880
It was right here.

2101
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:32,840
Yeah, it was right here.

2102
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,540
I got this guy now.

2103
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,060
I'll save him.

2104
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,880
Why do I shoot him?

2105
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,040
Why do I shoot the wrong guy every time?

2106
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:41,680
Oops.

2107
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:43,820
I can't engage with the zombie.

2108
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,800
Cause I know it's too...

2109
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,220
Okay, the train!

2110
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:45,520
The train!

2111
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:45,800
The train!

2112
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:45,920
The train!

2113
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,940
Oh, that was close.

2114
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:57,960
As soon as I start fighting a zombie, that's when the train comes.

2115
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,920
Okay, we keep going.

2116
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:06,230
Oh!

2117
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,730
Even when they die here, they like drop their loot.

2118
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:09,250
That's so nice.

2119
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:09,590
I know.

2120
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,850
Just let the train do it.

2121
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:14,210
Yeah.

2122
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,920
Oh, it looks electrified.

2123
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:20,600
Oh my god!

2124
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,120
Crazy!

2125
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:21,860
Oh, run he is.

2126
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:22,980
I'll shoot him.

2127
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,060
Or he could die on his own, I feel.

2128
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:27,880
Oh.

2129
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:28,960
He should be.

2130
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,700
Ah!

2131
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,490
Oh, he's still standing there.

2132
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:40,930
He's still st...

2133
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:41,270
Ah!

2134
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:42,050
Oh, shoot!

2135
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,190
He's still...

2136
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,090
Got a pipe!

2137
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,750
I got his butt.

2138
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,610
Can we turn it off?

2139
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,490
Um...

2140
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:56,510
Oh, I just know the train is coming any second now.

2141
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,470
If you come here...

2142
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:58,010
Oh, do we just go this way?

2143
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,170
Yeah, yeah, we go this way.

2144
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,720
They won't come through, right?

2145
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:05,780
They don't know how to climb.

2146
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,960
You need a buddy to go through.

2147
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:09,540
Uh-oh.

2148
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:10,060
Ah!

2149
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,220
Watch out!

2150
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,140
It's very dark in here.

2151
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,320
I know, I was gonna say.

2152
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,360
Even with the gamma all the way up.

2153
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,840
How would we have been able to see otherwise?

2154
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,140
I know!

2155
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,800
Oh, they're coming down!

2156
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,040
Look at these tiny little flashlights.

2157
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,200
They're coming down to me!

2158
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,280
Should we run?

2159
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:28,060
Oh, yeah.

2160
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,160
Just run.

2161
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:35,490
No.

2162
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:37,090
More tracks.

2163
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:39,270
Oh!

2164
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:40,730
Oh, look a serpent thing!

2165
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:41,890
Oh my gosh, they're here.

2166
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,190
Ow!

2167
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,850
Ow!

2168
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:45,170
Oh,

2169
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:54,700
behind you!

2170
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,160
Oh!

2171
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,380
Nice.

2172
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,600
Nice!

2173
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,280
Yeah!

2174
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,840
I'm ready to go shopping.

2175
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:11,740
We're getting... I know!

2176
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,140
We're getting so many skill points!

2177
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:13,880
How do I...

2178
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,700
Wait, what do I do with this?

2179
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,620
Do I shoot this?

2180
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,260
Maybe.

2181
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,240
I'll shoot it.

2182
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:20,560
Aha!

2183
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:24,870
Nice.

2184
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:28,410
So they can unlock a nice little JPEG to look at.

2185
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:31,630
I love behind the scenes.

2186
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,630
I guess we just keep going.

2187
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:35,970
What's that sound?

2188
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:36,910
Is that train sound?

2189
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:40,250
My worst enemy in this game!

2190
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:41,250
Train?

2191
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:42,610
Oh, wait.

2192
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:43,550
Or...

2193
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:44,310
Something.

2194
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:45,110
I don't know.

2195
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:46,590
Something's going on.

2196
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:47,150
Ah!

2197
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:49,710
Uh-oh.

2198
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:51,830
We can take them!

2199
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:52,530
Can we?

2200
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,010
Oh my gosh.

2201
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:56,250
Or we could run.

2202
01:15:59,250 --> 01:15:59,750
Whoa.

2203
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,890
Whoa.

2204
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,570
Train!

2205
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:03,310
Train!

2206
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:04,070
Train!

2207
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,050
Are you okay?

2208
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,190
I'm okay.

2209
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:11,190
Oh.

2210
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:12,350
Nice.

2211
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,390
Get his butt!

2212
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:18,690
It might come...

2213
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:20,810
Am I coming the other way?

2214
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:21,690
Yeah, I was outside.

2215
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:23,490
Ow!

2216
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:24,970
At least they don't make you do a QT.

2217
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,450
Oh!

2218
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,390
I just hit the QT and I failed it.

2219
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,490
This guy's got an axe in him.

2220
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,390
Yeah.

2221
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,710
Can I have that?

2222
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,810
Why is this guy so strong?

2223
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:37,490
Oh my gosh.

2224
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:39,730
I'm just gonna blast him.

2225
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,120
He axed me to kill him.

2226
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,480
He did, I saw it.

2227
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,460
Oh, there's a skill point over here.

2228
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:57,840
Yeah.

2229
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,600
Grab all the good...

2230
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,420
Oh, if...

2231
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,000
Wait, why are there guys dead over here?

2232
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,440
Oh, the train.

2233
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:06,920
I already forgot.

2234
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,420
Excellent.

2235
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,360
My worst enemy and my best friend both.

2236
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:13,560
Train.

2237
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:15,500
Train, my beloved.

2238
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,340
It could be enemies to lovers, Ark, you know?

2239
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,000
It could be.

2240
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,360
There it is.

2241
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:23,420
There it is.

2242
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:24,780
Oh!

2243
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:25,960
Uh-oh.

2244
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:27,720
Are we gonna ride it?

2245
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,380
It just lost power though.

2246
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:30,420
Oh.

2247
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,320
No!

2248
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:34,800
It really isn't our lucky...

2249
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,820
It means it won't be running us over.

2250
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,040
Oh my gosh, this guy started crawling at you.

2251
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:54,460
Oh my gosh.

2252
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,720
Wait, so what...

2253
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,240
We're getting in?

2254
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:57,560
What did he say?

2255
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,260
I think we have to climb.

2256
01:17:59,160 --> 01:17:59,580
Oh.

2257
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,940
Oh, I'm gonna lift you up.

2258
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:01,860
Helena.

2259
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:02,740
Okay.

2260
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,240
Helena.

2261
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:03,620
Okay.

2262
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,480
Wait, are we separating?

2263
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,560
No!

2264
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,940
Yeah, you gotta open the door for me.

2265
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,160
Helena.

2266
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:16,520
Helena.

2267
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,100
Helena.

2268
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,760
I'm glad you're here.

2269
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:19,800
Hello?

2270
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,860
I'm glad you're here.

2271
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,000
Why do you say it twice?

2272
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:25,960
This way.

2273
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,140
This guy definitely moved earlier.

2274
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,340
There it is.

2275
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,620
Why does he only get me?

2276
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:38,860
What?

2277
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:40,700
Jerk.

2278
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:41,920
Yeah.

2279
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,960
Look at her heels.

2280
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,540
I know.

2281
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,780
She's styling.

2282
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,460
Is she even a zombie?

2283
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,760
I was gonna say, she looks really healthy.

2284
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,040
What's wrong with you?

2285
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,940
She looks fine.

2286
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:55,380
Oh.

2287
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,080
Uh-oh.

2288
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,460
We can save him.

2289
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,380
Helena.

2290
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:03,460
We're in no rush.

2291
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:03,920
Come on.

2292
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,480
Oh.

2293
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,860
Why is my gun now?

2294
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:10,880
You know why.

2295
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:13,660
Oh.

2296
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,060
Wait, did you just get hurt by something?

2297
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:17,680
Come on.

2298
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:17,940
No.

2299
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,680
I just heard a scary sound.

2300
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,220
Helena.

2301
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,340
Is this like that one anomaly game?

2302
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,180
We're supposed to be spotted the difference?

2303
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,240
Or we just saw an endless loop?

2304
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,580
In this train?

2305
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:37,920
Hey.

2306
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:41,280
He doesn't even care for her name anymore.

2307
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:45,760
Oh.

2308
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,500
Good work.

2309
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:47,060
Oh.

2310
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:47,460
Oh.

2311
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:47,500
Ah.

2312
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:50,660
Oh, there's people behind us?

2313
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:51,600
Oh.

2314
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,180
Oh.

2315
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:53,240
We're getting off the train.

2316
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,660
I think we're getting off the train now.

2317
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:01,900
Oh my god.

2318
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:03,440
Damn.

2319
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,600
He hit me hard.

2320
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,690
I wish I could do a jump attack.

2321
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:16,670
I know.

2322
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,120
I'm helping.

2323
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,360
I think you're doing like 90% of everything right now.

2324
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:28,660
No.

2325
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,220
I'm just swinging my knife around.

2326
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,100
That's the game.

2327
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,420
Wait, I think this is the lady.

2328
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,280
I screamed.

2329
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:36,520
You okay?

2330
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:37,260
Oh.

2331
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,940
Pretty lady?

2332
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,080
Pretty lady.

2333
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,700
Just kidding.

2334
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:55,990
If you like survived up until now, why would you come out of your hiding spot?

2335
01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:56,990
I feel.

2336
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,150
Yeah.

2337
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:01,130
Like, I feel like you could make it.

2338
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:05,190
Okay, I'm gonna press this button and it might activate an alarm.

2339
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,290
Did you see these bombs?

2340
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:08,630
Oh!

2341
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,090
Was there a bomb?

2342
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:12,830
Over here.

2343
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,590
Oh.

2344
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,150
I had to say Peter!

2345
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:16,850
Please!

2346
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:17,830
Leon.

2347
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:19,250
It's never gonna get you.

2348
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,990
That's right.

2349
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,830
No!

2350
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,930
Don't open that!

2351
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:23,530
Uh-oh.

2352
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:24,770
Oh, it's her fault.

2353
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:25,610
Peter!

2354
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:26,690
Peter!

2355
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:27,010
Peter!

2356
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:27,190
Peter!

2357
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:27,630
Well...

2358
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,810
Why would you think this is a smart thing to do?

2359
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:30,790
Oh, there are bombs here.

2360
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:36,970
Uh-oh.

2361
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:37,990
Wait, I placed a bomb.

2362
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:38,490
What?

2363
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,030
Blow it!

2364
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:39,430
Blow it!

2365
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:39,910
Blow it!

2366
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:41,330
Let them get closer.

2367
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:44,590
Wait, someone's spitting.

2368
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:45,170
Yeah.

2369
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,290
They're missing.

2370
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:49,350
I think you can blow it up now, right?

2371
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:50,930
Ooh!

2372
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:51,570
Ooh!

2373
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:53,930
Oh.

2374
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:55,470
Wait, they all got him.

2375
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:04,130
Oh, we can go finish him off.

2376
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:04,830
Yeah.

2377
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,430
They're probably...

2378
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,070
They're weak now.

2379
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,790
Oh, dang.

2380
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:09,810
Get some air time.

2381
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:11,470
Uh-oh.

2382
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:12,830
We need backup.

2383
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:13,030
No.

2384
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:15,450
We got this.

2385
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:16,130
Who's coming?

2386
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,130
Ouch.

2387
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,670
Maybe, maybe Ada.

2388
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,410
Whoever that is.

2389
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:22,730
Yeah.

2390
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:24,550
Ow!

2391
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:25,550
Ooh, they're sp...

2392
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,890
Ew, they're spittin', they're spittin'.

2393
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,510
Are they toxic?

2394
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:31,990
Ew.

2395
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,390
Yeah, toxic.

2396
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:34,210
I'm...

2397
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,190
I'm...

2398
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:35,570
I'm...

2399
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:36,030
I'm...

2400
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:36,270
I'm...

2401
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:36,590
I'm...

2402
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,550
I'm...

2403
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:43,730
I have one mint left.

2404
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,850
That's ironic.

2405
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:48,290
Oh!

2406
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:48,750
Oh!

2407
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:49,690
Where'd that person come from?

2408
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:49,910
Ah!

2409
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:51,650
Oh, they're coming for the body!

2410
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:52,110
Oh!

2411
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:53,170
Oh!

2412
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:53,710
Did I die?

2413
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,530
Don't do that.

2414
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:55,630
Get outside.

2415
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:56,570
You died?

2416
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:57,750
No.

2417
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:59,070
I got bit...

2418
01:22:59,070 --> 01:23:01,670
She tore a chunk out of my neck, but I'm fine.

2419
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,090
Oh, okay.

2420
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:04,890
You're not infected or anything.

2421
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,330
It's...

2422
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:06,750
It's fine, probably.

2423
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,010
Yeah.

2424
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:09,890
Only if you breathe the fog, right?

2425
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:10,370
Yeah!

2426
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,170
Yeah!

2427
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,040
Wait, so this goes...

2428
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:13,870
Wait, no.

2429
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,450
Um...

2430
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,270
Uh...

2431
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,010
How do I...

2432
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:17,290
Okay.

2433
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:17,950
Okay.

2434
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:19,010
I'm learning.

2435
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,870
I think I'm stuck.

2436
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,550
What?

2437
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:23,810
Oh!

2438
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:24,590
You made it.

2439
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,410
You can reach the street level from there.

2440
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,130
What are conditions like up there?

2441
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:31,150
This thing is really fun.

2442
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:33,130
Hell on Earth isn't much of a stretch.

2443
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,770
We didn't pay.

2444
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,610
It makes a nice sound.

2445
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:40,670
It does.

2446
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:43,970
Usually they don't let you go back, you know?

2447
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:44,330
I know!

2448
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,790
It's a one-way street.

2449
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,530
Nice.

2450
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:51,090
Say it.

2451
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,250
This is my favorite part of this game.

2452
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,170
Just needy Leon.

2453
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:05,210
Yes!

2454
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:06,410
I'm glad you're here.

2455
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:07,970
How do you say that?

2456
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,870
You two will have to cross that part of town to get to the cathedral.

2457
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,050
I don't know.

2458
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:10,730
I hold me.

2459
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:13,070
Keep your lines open in case you run into trouble.

2460
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:13,570
Nice.

2461
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:14,030
Thanks for that.

2462
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:14,990
Oh, I got it too.

2463
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:15,970
Thanks for that.

2464
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:17,110
Oh, I can praise.

2465
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:17,850
Good work.

2466
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:19,450
Oh, I just took...

2467
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:19,710
Dang it.

2468
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,070
Nice.

2469
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:21,890
Appreciate it.

2470
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:22,770
Fall back.

2471
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,870
Wait.

2472
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:26,770
The music is so...

2473
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,330
This way.

2474
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:28,650
Why can't I say it anymore?

2475
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:29,450
Oh.

2476
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:29,810
Move it.

2477
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:31,890
Good work.

2478
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:33,370
It doesn't work.

2479
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:33,450
It doesn't work.

2480
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:34,030
I appreciate it.

2481
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,550
Wait, maybe if I hold V and then...

2482
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:38,930
Oh, here we go.

2483
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:39,490
Good job.

2484
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:40,090
Oh.

2485
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:40,590
Yeah.

2486
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:41,770
Thanks for that.

2487
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:43,590
Move it.

2488
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,650
It feels a little passive-aggressive.

2489
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,030
They're just going back and forth.

2490
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:53,110
Thanks.

2491
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:54,250
Thanks for that.

2492
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:54,670
Yeah.

2493
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:55,830
Thanks.

2494
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:56,530
Oh.

2495
01:24:59,210 --> 01:24:59,830
Oh.

2496
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:00,430
Oh.

2497
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,370
Oh.

2498
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:07,410
We can't save him.

2499
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:08,770
Save yourself.

2500
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:11,310
Slice him.

2501
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:12,910
Wait.

2502
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,070
I thought it was a headshot.

2503
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:14,690
Come on.

2504
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:18,950
This game.

2505
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,790
Leo, look out.

2506
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:20,850
Ah!

2507
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:22,330
Oh.

2508
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:22,490
Oh.

2509
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:23,610
GTA!

2510
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:25,350
That's the cars!

2511
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:27,130
Wait, is that a live person?

2512
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:27,950
Wait, are these people?

2513
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,610
These are people!

2514
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:29,110
These are people like people.

2515
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:32,770
These are real people!

2516
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:34,410
Oh.

2517
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:35,170
This guy's dead.

2518
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,670
Are you okay?

2519
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:38,430
No.

2520
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:40,210
Oh!

2521
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:44,540
Lay off the horn!

2522
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,080
Noisy!

2523
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,080
Wait, there's something here.

2524
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:49,900
What did I miss?

2525
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:50,400
Skill point?

2526
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:50,820
Oh.

2527
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:52,920
Ew!

2528
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,820
The water is gross.

2529
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,600
Oh, that's Raccoon City, baby.

2530
01:25:58,900 --> 01:25:59,940
I guess we just keep running.

2531
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,660
Oh my god!

2532
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,320
Are you okay?

2533
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,400
Leo.

2534
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:07,040
Hold on.

2535
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:07,700
I'll get you out.

2536
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,680
Oh, we'll get you out.

2537
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,700
I'll get you out.

2538
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:11,860
I'll get you out.

2539
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,840
Oh my god!

2540
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,360
Wow!

2541
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:14,780
Oh.

2542
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:15,860
Everything's gone to hell.

2543
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:16,820
Oh my god.

2544
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:17,440
This is crazy.

2545
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,160
Just run for it!

2546
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:19,800
Redbird!

2547
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,980
We don't have time to deal with it.

2548
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,260
Go, go, go!

2549
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,040
Am I going the right way?

2550
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:23,880
Yeah, I think so.

2551
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:24,900
Yeah.

2552
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,060
Up the ladder.

2553
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,040
Oh my god!

2554
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,560
They're having a little party, dance party down there.

2555
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:35,060
Yeah.

2556
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:35,740
It's crazy.

2557
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,040
Okay, I'm gonna jump.

2558
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,180
I don't know how to climb, right?

2559
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:39,780
Oh!

2560
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:50,000
Every time I get grabbed, I just reflexively start spinning my control stick.

2561
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,800
Oh, is that what you're supposed to...

2562
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,920
Is that what the QT is?

2563
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,020
Is that what the QT is?

2564
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,340
Is that what the QT is?

2565
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,000
Sometimes for me.

2566
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,700
Gotta be ready.

2567
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,200
Yeah.

2568
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,260
Look at Caillou.

2569
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:00,620
Oh.

2570
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,220
Over here.

2571
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,660
There's no time.

2572
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,620
There's a bit crying.

2573
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,400
I'm in a bad case of deja vu.

2574
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:11,940
I'm just running.

2575
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:12,540
Yeah, me too.

2576
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,380
I don't want to travel.

2577
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,480
Wait.

2578
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,660
Just keep going.

2579
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:18,880
Okay.

2580
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:19,320
Okay.

2581
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,480
Hey, get out of our way, buddy.

2582
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,220
I want a hug!

2583
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,100
Oh, Nippy Nightmare, I'm your biggest fan!

2584
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,080
Where do we...

2585
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,460
Oh.

2586
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,020
Oh.

2587
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,120
Not enough.

2588
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,060
They're pretty strong!

2589
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,560
They're very strong!

2590
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,760
What the hell?

2591
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,040
Oh, ouch!

2592
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,100
Who's shooting me?

2593
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:52,760
Oh.

2594
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:53,740
Oh my god!

2595
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,880
Oh, I think I'm...

2596
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:57,020
What?

2597
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,780
Oh, I'm good.

2598
01:27:58,020 --> 01:27:58,180
Okay.

2599
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,000
Can I help you?

2600
01:27:59,200 --> 01:27:59,480
Okay.

2601
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,160
Wait, where are we going?

2602
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:00,640
Oh, this way.

2603
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,160
Up here.

2604
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,580
I'm blind.

2605
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:05,760
Me too.

2606
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,860
Oh, gosh.

2607
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,100
This person made it even less far than we did.

2608
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:14,660
Oh, my god!

2609
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,360
Crazy.

2610
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,960
Every time I get to one of these, I just spam the button.

2611
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,440
Is that true?

2612
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,300
The fog.

2613
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:32,940
The fog.

2614
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:34,640
Oh, yeah.

2615
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,660
It's really...

2616
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:37,080
It is foggy in here, right?

2617
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,480
I feel like we're doomed.

2618
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:39,700
Yeah.

2619
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,540
Could just be smoke.

2620
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:42,780
From...

2621
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,300
Is it dinner time?

2622
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,420
I think we should have a drink!

2623
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,060
Hell yeah!

2624
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:52,240
Yeah.

2625
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,400
Oh.

2626
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:56,200
She said to stay inside and we immediately go back outside.

2627
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:57,900
That's fine.

2628
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:03,300
Alright.

2629
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,780
It's a one-person door.

2630
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:06,660
Ah!

2631
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:07,580
Oh!

2632
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,080
Oh, no!

2633
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,000
I think we go in here.

2634
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,240
Oh!

2635
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:20,880
Oh!

2636
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,600
There's this little skill point over there.

2637
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:29,100
I don't even know where we are or going.

2638
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,100
Why are they all dead?

2639
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:30,820
Oh, somebody's house?

2640
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:32,380
Wait, did they...

2641
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,960
What happened to you guys?

2642
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,580
They've...

2643
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:39,140
Maybe decided they didn't want to live through the zombie apocalypse.

2644
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,040
Look at this guy's mouth.

2645
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,180
It's like a Kingdom Hearts cutscene.

2646
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:43,760
Caution.

2647
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,200
They do not yet know who is responsible.

2648
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:47,400
KMGTuber.

2649
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:48,680
Yeah!

2650
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:55,890
Oh.

2651
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:57,550
I hear fire.

2652
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:00,270
Oh.

2653
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:01,830
This is crazy.

2654
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:03,670
I think they're gonna come at us.

2655
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:05,210
Oh, this guy's gonna come at us.

2656
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,310
Nope.

2657
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:06,870
Okay.

2658
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:10,190
It's locked.

2659
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:11,030
I'm standing on him.

2660
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:11,950
Locked.

2661
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:13,550
Locked?

2662
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:14,090
Oh!

2663
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,990
Find a key.

2664
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,870
Okay.

2665
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:16,470
Oh.

2666
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:18,410
Good thing they tell you where the key is.

2667
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,050
I don't.

2668
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,170
There's no mystery here.

2669
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:24,970
It's very head empty.

2670
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:26,230
You can just run around.

2671
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:26,610
I don't.

2672
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:27,490
Run to the next...

2673
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:29,370
Marked point on your map.

2674
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:29,990
Oh.

2675
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:30,470
Oh.

2676
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,490
How romantic.

2677
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,390
Map.

2678
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:32,830
Hello?

2679
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:35,290
He looks fresh.

2680
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:36,350
He does.

2681
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:36,850
Oh.

2682
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:40,090
Okay.

2683
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:42,150
He doesn't look so fresh anymore.

2684
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:45,110
It happens so fast when they change.

2685
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:45,750
It's like...

2686
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,390
It does.

2687
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:46,830
Crazy.

2688
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,550
This guy's gonna get up.

2689
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:49,530
Oh.

2690
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:50,050
Oh.

2691
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:50,730
There it is.

2692
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:51,050
Oh!

2693
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:54,190
Oh, thank you.

2694
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,490
The physics...

2695
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,050
Physics are crazy.

2696
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,490
I'm learning...

2697
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:03,870
Oh, a shotgun!

2698
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:05,430
I'm learning this game now.

2699
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:05,730
Oh!

2700
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,590
Better shotgun.

2701
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,250
Bigger shotgun?

2702
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,170
Sorry mister.

2703
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,050
Oh.

2704
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:18,250
Sorry mister.

2705
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:21,490
Oh.

2706
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:21,790
Sorry mister.

2707
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:22,550
We are cussing.

2708
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:24,090
Oh.

2709
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,170
This looks like a boss.

2710
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:25,710
A boss?

2711
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:26,250
Yeah.

2712
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:28,570
Ooh.

2713
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:29,730
Ooh!

2714
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:30,310
Yeah!

2715
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:30,970
Ooh!

2716
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:33,310
That's why they gave us a better gun.

2717
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:34,290
Oh yeah.

2718
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,360
I might even use it.

2719
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,560
I'll get the guys up here.

2720
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,600
You got...

2721
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,740
Ooh!

2722
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:49,820
Ooh!

2723
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:52,640
Ooh!

2724
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,000
Oh, you got him?

2725
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:53,820
Is he not a boss?

2726
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,000
He just ran away instantly.

2727
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,140
What am I jumping over?

2728
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:00,500
Oh.

2729
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:00,920
Ooh!

2730
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:01,800
Ooh!

2731
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:07,720
Ooh!

2732
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:07,740
Ooh!

2733
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:08,080
Ooh!

2734
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:09,880
Ooh!

2735
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,360
There it is.

2736
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:10,860
Whoa!

2737
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,520
Oh!

2738
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,300
Oh shoot!

2739
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,460
I got you!

2740
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:15,600
Ah!

2741
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:16,560
Oh shoot!

2742
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,360
What's happening?

2743
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,300
I don't even know!

2744
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,000
Oh my god!

2745
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,120
Oh my god!

2746
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:20,700
Oh no!

2747
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:21,760
Oh thank you!

2748
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,900
Where is he?

2749
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:32,920
Let me...

2750
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,380
There's no way he opened and closed this door.

2751
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:36,800
There's no way.

2752
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,140
He might have.

2753
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:40,540
He's got manners.

2754
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:41,040
Oh!

2755
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,240
Is that him?

2756
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,300
Yeah, that's him!

2757
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:44,900
Oh my god!

2758
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,480
He looks like the thing from, uh...

2759
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:46,960
What's it called?

2760
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:49,280
The...

2761
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,060
The monster in Dead by Daylight.

2762
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:54,520
What?

2763
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,040
Which one?

2764
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:55,700
Damn it!

2765
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,300
Which Dead by Daylight?

2766
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,600
There's like a guy.

2767
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:00,200
He's...

2768
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,240
I think he's called the Unknown.

2769
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,000
Oh.

2770
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,160
Oh he dropped...

2771
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:04,920
You like Dead by Daylight?

2772
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,000
I've never...

2773
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,520
I've played a little bit, but I've never like gotten super into it.

2774
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,420
Yeah, me too.

2775
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,180
I think we go upstairs.

2776
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:13,740
Do we?

2777
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,260
He gave...

2778
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,480
That seemed like a giant totem.

2779
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,740
Of a skill point.

2780
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:21,680
Leon.

2781
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:23,100
Leon.

2782
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:23,900
Hurry it up.

2783
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,960
We really still not get any skills.

2784
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,060
I know, right?

2785
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,740
Where do we get to pay the money?

2786
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:31,080
Up and over.

2787
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:31,600
Oh!

2788
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:32,220
Whoa!

2789
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:34,620
That was impressive.

2790
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,500
That was impressive.

2791
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,580
You ready?

2792
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:37,880
Oh, are you coming over?

2793
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,440
Or...

2794
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:38,660
Okay.

2795
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:39,600
I don't know.

2796
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,140
I got this all on my own.

2797
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,980
I don't know, I jumped.

2798
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,720
I'm going.

2799
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:45,500
I'm going.

2800
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:46,360
Don't...

2801
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,160
You handle it.

2802
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,640
I'm pushing something.

2803
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,480
Okay.

2804
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,220
Don't worry about it.

2805
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:51,940
I'll fight.

2806
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,000
Okay, keep fighting.

2807
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,620
I'm pushing.

2808
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:57,440
I'm pushing.

2809
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,280
Oh, I can just hold it.

2810
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:03,840
Ow, ow, ow.

2811
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,520
Oh, I got another bite.

2812
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,620
What the hell just happened?

2813
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:10,480
Uh-oh.

2814
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,220
Um...

2815
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,500
Uh, I think I unlocked this for you.

2816
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,000
Uh-oh.

2817
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,940
I think I might be dying.

2818
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:18,940
I might have died.

2819
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,200
I might have died.

2820
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,420
I need you.

2821
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:23,340
I'm nothing without you.

2822
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:27,340
I got you.

2823
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,160
This...

2824
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,280
Oh, from here again?

2825
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,040
Oh no, back here.

2826
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,460
I'm sorry.

2827
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,400
No, it's okay.

2828
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:39,150
This guy was nothing.

2829
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:39,610
We need to watch this again.

2830
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:40,530
He was easy peasy.

2831
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:41,790
He actually was.

2832
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,520
What is that?

2833
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,960
I like this new gun.

2834
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,040
It's nice.

2835
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,420
Oh yeah?

2836
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,800
I wouldn't know.

2837
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,340
Wait, this doesn't only use the dice.

2838
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:02,480
Oh.

2839
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,380
Wait, what just happened to me?

2840
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:06,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2841
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:07,240
Oh.

2842
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,720
Why were they in cages?

2843
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,500
Good question.

2844
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:17,410
They're locked away.

2845
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:18,950
It's jail.

2846
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:20,550
Actually, maybe it's like one of the...

2847
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:20,650
Pinata!

2848
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:21,690
Pinata!

2849
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:25,590
Oh!

2850
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:26,310
I got you!

2851
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:29,710
Oh my god, he's here!

2852
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,630
Don't leave!

2853
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:33,890
Where?

2854
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:35,490
Oh, dang it.

2855
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:36,870
I had to reload.

2856
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,650
Uh-oh, I don't have very many bullets left.

2857
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:39,970
Where'd he go?

2858
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:41,170
Oh, there he is.

2859
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:41,470
He's running.

2860
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:42,350
Oh, that's not him.

2861
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,310
I'm chasing him down.

2862
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:45,350
Get his ass!

2863
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:47,990
He's scared!

2864
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,080
Kill him.

2865
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:04,800
Take his super skills.

2866
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:05,680
Yeah.

2867
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,140
Okay.

2868
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,240
That's interesting.

2869
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,620
I thought he would like, run to the area.

2870
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,100
I thought you too.

2871
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,060
You ran, like, all the way back.

2872
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:16,820
I'm scared.

2873
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:17,040
I'm scared.

2874
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,560
Do you have any ammo?

2875
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,220
No, mister?

2876
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:19,580
Okay.

2877
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,660
Can I give you my ammo?

2878
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,340
Wait, do you have ammo?

2879
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:25,660
Yes.

2880
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:30,740
A little bit.

2881
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:31,560
For this gun.

2882
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:33,060
I'll try and use it sparingly.

2883
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:37,820
Okay, now we go up here.

2884
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:39,300
Or, we go here, yeah.

2885
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,480
And we're like, it's locked.

2886
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:41,780
Then we go up here.

2887
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,000
And then I won't die this time.

2888
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:46,520
Just...

2889
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,680
Just hold it out.

2890
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,200
You can give ammo?

2891
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:53,360
Can you?

2892
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,640
I'll be faster this time.

2893
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:56,880
Okay.

2894
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,460
Oops.

2895
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:05,590
I'm pushing!

2896
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:06,070
I'm pushing!

2897
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:11,210
I'm going as fast as I can!

2898
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:13,950
Alright, I think I open this for you.

2899
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:16,490
Down here.

2900
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:16,810
Where?

2901
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:18,790
Maybe this door here, yeah.

2902
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:22,370
Uh-oh.

2903
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,310
I'm just hiding.

2904
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:30,610
It's open!

2905
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:34,210
I'm coming!

2906
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,240
Sometimes being a coward works.

2907
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,160
Oh, gosh.

2908
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:42,560
Watch out!

2909
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,040
He's behind you.

2910
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,200
I was...

2911
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:48,940
I was reading the ketchup and mustard bottles.

2912
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:49,860
Can we shut the door?

2913
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,020
Why do we leave it open?

2914
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,360
We should be able to.

2915
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,680
Oh, I did it again.

2916
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,800
Oh, there's a thingy here.

2917
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,220
Serpent emblem.

2918
01:37:58,680 --> 01:37:58,820
Oh!

2919
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:01,000
Um...

2920
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,240
Wait, I can just knock it with my hand.

2921
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:05,480
Yes.

2922
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:06,220
Maybe.

2923
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:07,920
Punch it.

2924
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:08,600
I can't...

2925
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:10,240
I'm too weak.

2926
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:11,380
Uh-oh.

2927
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:13,620
Uh-oh.

2928
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,000
I got it.

2929
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:14,260
Uh-oh.

2930
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:15,980
Oh, come on, guys!

2931
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:16,640
Leave us alone!

2932
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,400
He kind of does...

2933
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,700
This area reminds me of Silent Hill.

2934
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,580
Wait, did he drop anything?

2935
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:32,000
Nope.

2936
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,280
Over here.

2937
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,160
I'm coming!

2938
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:41,730
Oh, my God.

2939
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:42,410
Good question.

2940
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:44,110
I don't want to die!

2941
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:45,050
Oh, no.

2942
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:46,130
Oh, there's a lot.

2943
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:46,550
Come on.

2944
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:47,730
We have to help him.

2945
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:48,250
We do?

2946
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:50,210
Alright.

2947
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:54,150
Can these guys live for once?

2948
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:55,330
Oh, come on.

2949
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,070
I pressed R.

2950
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,650
Oh, my aim.

2951
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,500
Wait, Peter.

2952
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:07,200
Peter again?

2953
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,600
There's Peter.

2954
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:10,600
Oh, my God.

2955
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:11,880
Eliminate all enemies.

2956
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,360
Who made you the leader?

2957
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:14,740
Okay.

2958
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,160
Peter is a sought-after man, isn't he?

2959
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:23,920
Wait, was he...

2960
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,740
Oh, was he the guy that...

2961
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,420
I think I died.

2962
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,660
You died.

2963
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,200
What was that?

2964
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:37,680
There was no quicks...

2965
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,780
Or no...

2966
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:40,700
I don't know.

2967
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:41,180
Where?

2968
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,680
There was nothing to help with that.

2969
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,140
Oh, my goodness.

2970
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:47,980
Where's the cutie?

2971
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:48,600
Don't be there.

2972
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,420
Don't be there.

2973
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,280
Don't be anywhere else.

2974
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,020
I know, right?

2975
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:53,600
Oh, oh.

2976
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,260
Oh, damn.

2977
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,180
Alright.

2978
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,160
Oh, they're calling them cannibal freaks.

2979
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,480
Is this like the Walking Dead universe where the concept of zombies doesn't exist?

2980
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,040
Maybe.

2981
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:09,480
Oh!

2982
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:09,840
Hello.

2983
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:11,000
Oh, my gosh.

2984
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:12,540
Oh!

2985
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:13,080
Ouch!

2986
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,040
I'm loading on him.

2987
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:16,880
We get out of the way.

2988
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:18,900
Ouch!

2989
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,620
Yeah, let's get out of the way, maybe.

2990
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:23,680
Peter, wait!

2991
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:27,680
Peter!

2992
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:32,340
I'm just waiting for the ambulance to show up.

2993
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,920
I'm just gonna bury him.

2994
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:37,980
Oh!

2995
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,460
Why is it going a different way?

2996
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,140
Okay, never mind.

2997
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:41,160
What the hell?

2998
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:41,440
Ow!

2999
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:41,840
Ow!

3000
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:42,400
Ow!

3001
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:46,390
Oh, my gosh.

3002
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:48,570
Can you imagine if friendly fire was actually on this?

3003
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:48,870
Oh!

3004
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:49,210
Ow!

3005
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:50,350
I think I died!

3006
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:50,690
Wait!

3007
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:52,010
No, I'm not dead.

3008
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:52,690
I'm alive!

3009
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:54,270
Who got me?

3010
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:56,350
I don't know.

3011
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,290
Who's this guy?

3012
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:04,110
There we go.

3013
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:04,870
Can I take your gun?

3014
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:05,450
Shoot the gas!

3015
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:07,570
We can blow these things to Kingdom Cup!

3016
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:10,010
I think we should get further away if we do that.

3017
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:11,430
Oh!

3018
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,210
I hate this guy.

3019
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:15,070
I know, he's annoying.

3020
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:25,000
Some zombies with guns.

3021
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,100
Move out of the way, Mr. Police!

3022
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:29,960
Marsh, there are zombies with guns.

3023
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:30,580
Yeah.

3024
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:32,060
Oh, we got him.

3025
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:32,360
Nice.

3026
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,100
I'm taking your skill points.

3027
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:36,360
Ow!

3028
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,920
Oh, should we blow it up?

3029
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,660
Yeah, they're like, hello, are you gonna blow it up?

3030
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:41,840
Yeah.

3031
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,380
He's getting knocked out.

3032
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:53,230
Beautiful fire.

3033
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:55,770
Fireworks.

3034
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:56,770
Gunshot?

3035
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:02,770
Oh, I hope they have melee weapons at the gun shop.

3036
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:04,270
Wait, I'm gonna grab a...

3037
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:05,450
I don't see any other options.

3038
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:06,290
Ammo and stuff for us.

3039
01:42:06,650 --> 01:42:07,250
Is there loot?

3040
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:08,370
Oh yeah, there is loot!

3041
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:09,750
I see it.

3042
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:11,070
Good thinking.

3043
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:14,310
The loot, grab the loot!

3044
01:42:15,110 --> 01:42:16,390
Actually, there's not that much.

3045
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:17,830
Yeah.

3046
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:23,010
They better have something good at the shop.

3047
01:42:25,230 --> 01:42:25,790
Yeah,

3048
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:30,830
I want a better melee weapon.

3049
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:31,670
I want a knife.

3050
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:33,470
At the gun shop.

3051
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:35,050
A machete!

3052
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:35,150
A machete!

3053
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,310
I want a katana!

3054
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:40,770
Hello!

3055
01:42:44,610 --> 01:42:45,170
Okay.

3056
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:47,490
Why don't we shut doors behind us?

3057
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:48,710
I know!

3058
01:43:02,570 --> 01:43:07,830
I got a grenade.

3059
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:09,070
But where's the rest?

3060
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:10,970
Oh, here's some.

3061
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:12,370
You just took it?

3062
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:13,210
You just stole it?

3063
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:13,750
Yeah.

3064
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:15,650
Oh, me too.

3065
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:18,010
Wait, but why can't we grab great guns?

3066
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:18,690
And that's no way?

3067
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,650
Oh, he's got ammo too.

3068
01:43:22,030 --> 01:43:22,330
Where?

3069
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:23,790
Why can't we grab the guns?

3070
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:29,110
This seems a little backwards.

3071
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:31,210
We're robbing him.

3072
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:32,170
Oh.

3073
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:33,770
Lady, are you gonna do anything?

3074
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,580
Yeah, get his butt.

3075
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:43,980
Oh.

3076
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,360
Trying not to shoot you, but I guess it doesn't matter because I turned it off.

3077
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:49,640
Did you just dodge?

3078
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,060
Somehow.

3079
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:53,840
I

3080
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,820
just skewed, kind of like, in my cut scene.

3081
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:06,780
Yes.

3082
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,700
You're doing the... the goal shooting.

3083
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:11,680
You're kicking the camera.

3084
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:12,160
Ah, yeah!

3085
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:13,160
I am.

3086
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:16,720
Oh.

3087
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,080
Oh, I thought I was loaded.

3088
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:18,840
Oopsie.

3089
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:23,330
Uh-oh.

3090
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:25,370
Oh, I...

3091
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:29,350
Romance!

3092
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:30,570
Yeah.

3093
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:31,230
Oh, come on.

3094
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:32,070
That... that hit.

3095
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:32,670
That hit.

3096
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:33,030
Crazy!

3097
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:34,230
Spare the heroic!

3098
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,690
She's just slowing us down anyway.

3099
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:36,330
Oh.

3100
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:37,250
What's the matter with you?

3101
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:38,470
She's your girlfriend.

3102
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:42,790
Is my gun not good anymore?

3103
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:44,210
Oh!

3104
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:56,980
Are you okay?

3105
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:57,640
I don't know.

3106
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:58,680
I'm in trouble.

3107
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,540
Oh, thank you.

3108
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:00,260
Oh!

3109
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:00,460
Oh!

3110
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,860
You finished me off!

3111
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:09,220
I... I guess so.

3112
01:45:11,010 --> 01:45:11,320
Nice!

3113
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:11,740
Good job!

3114
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:16,980
Oh, dang it.

3115
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,380
I'm just letting the NPC do the work.

3116
01:45:24,620 --> 01:45:25,000
Yeah.

3117
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:25,360
And you.

3118
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,340
And you!

3119
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,440
And me!

3120
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:28,260
Oh!

3121
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:28,600
Oh!

3122
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:28,840
Oh!

3123
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,960
The jankiness is so good.

3124
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,560
It is.

3125
01:45:41,260 --> 01:45:43,420
Wait, there's an axe body spray?

3126
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:44,520
Where?

3127
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:45,000
Right here?

3128
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,340
Oh yeah, on the counter.

3129
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:48,700
I'll take it.

3130
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:50,040
What?

3131
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,360
They're not gonna stop coming!

3132
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:52,500
My gun's jammed!

3133
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:52,720
What?

3134
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,680
You're in a gun store!

3135
01:45:56,020 --> 01:45:56,820
You're in a gun store!

3136
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:57,480
You're in a gun store!

3137
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:57,540
Oh!

3138
01:45:58,780 --> 01:45:59,720
She's gonna get shot!

3139
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:01,660
You idiots can fight it out if you want!

3140
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:03,000
I'm getting the hell outta here!

3141
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:03,400
Okay.

3142
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,540
I wonder if the guy upstairs just got shot then.

3143
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,800
Oh, I see it.

3144
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:08,060
Yeah.

3145
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:09,280
Uh, alright.

3146
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:14,070
Oh!

3147
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:14,610
Ow!

3148
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:15,010
Ow!

3149
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:16,330
Are you okay?

3150
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:17,590
Are they in here?

3151
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:19,090
Is it a gun zombie?

3152
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:23,190
Oh, yeah.

3153
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:25,590
How do they know how to do that?

3154
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:26,990
Get the hell away from me!

3155
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:28,110
They're triggered at...

3156
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:28,690
They're American.

3157
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:29,430
That's why.

3158
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,470
In their...

3159
01:46:31,470 --> 01:46:32,290
In their instincts.

3160
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:32,830
Yeah.

3161
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:33,290
In their blood.

3162
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,170
What are you doing, buddy?

3163
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:36,590
There's no time for theatrics!

3164
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:38,170
Yeah, you deserve that.

3165
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:40,510
Ew!

3166
01:46:40,890 --> 01:46:42,550
I don't know why he got this thing after.

3167
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:42,990
Ooh!

3168
01:46:43,610 --> 01:46:44,750
New enemy type?

3169
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:47,410
Oh, was that Peter?

3170
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:48,110
Oh my god.

3171
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:48,770
Oh my god.

3172
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:50,550
Oh!

3173
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:52,650
Uh-oh.

3174
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:54,330
I got flashbanged.

3175
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:55,430
Am I gonna punch you?

3176
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:55,630
Punch me?

3177
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:00,090
Oh gosh.

3178
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,490
Oh gosh.

3179
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:01,270
Ah!

3180
01:47:01,670 --> 01:47:01,910
Ah!

3181
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:02,870
Oh!

3182
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:04,650
Oh my god.

3183
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:05,850
I keep getting flashbanged.

3184
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:06,810
Ow!

3185
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:07,450
Oh my god.

3186
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,370
Uh-oh.

3187
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:13,410
What the heck was that?

3188
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:15,130
That was crazy.

3189
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:17,590
It got like insane all of a sudden.

3190
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:18,210
Insane.

3191
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,850
Are we all the way back at the beginning?

3192
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:22,030
Are we all the way back at the beginning?

3193
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,590
Are we back at the start?

3194
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,150
Oh wait, no.

3195
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:24,370
We're not.

3196
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:24,710
Oh, okay.

3197
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:25,270
Good, good, good.

3198
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:26,350
Thank you.

3199
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,590
We get to launch this again.

3200
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:30,770
We're at the part where it just gets freaky enough.

3201
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:31,290
Yeah.

3202
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:37,410
Do we get hurt by our own bombs, I wonder?

3203
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:39,690
I don't know.

3204
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:42,490
I feel like we should, but maybe not.

3205
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:45,070
I can't tell what kind of game this is.

3206
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:47,350
If it's going for that kind of realism or not.

3207
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:47,670
I know.

3208
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:52,510
Did that take it out?

3209
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:52,750
No.

3210
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:54,570
Oh.

3211
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:56,870
Ow!

3212
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:58,410
Oh, good job, good job.

3213
01:47:58,930 --> 01:47:59,650
He just fell.

3214
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:01,910
Is he still...

3215
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:02,650
Oh, he's still up.

3216
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:07,550
Can't tell.

3217
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,150
Oh my gosh!

3218
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:16,190
It's like all...

3219
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:16,750
All armor?

3220
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:17,570
Oh, there we go.

3221
01:48:17,650 --> 01:48:17,830
Nice.

3222
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:19,910
Oh my god, they're coming in here too!

3223
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:24,680
I got you!

3224
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,160
Mister!

3225
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:35,650
I'm going back to the game.

3226
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:37,930
Not a shoddy...

3227
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:39,570
Kinda gal.

3228
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:42,470
I just...

3229
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:43,730
I just love...

3230
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:44,270
Melee.

3231
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:47,890
Even when it's banned.

3232
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:48,670
That's fair.

3233
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:53,150
How do you be quiet?

3234
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:53,670
How do you be quiet?

3235
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:01,050
Okay.

3236
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:03,470
You have this the whole time!

3237
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:08,320
Mister!

3238
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:10,180
Oh.

3239
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,580
Don't forget the healing spray.

3240
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,480
If you didn't grab it again.

3241
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3242
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,740
There's nothing really.

3243
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,240
We can't grab any new guns.

3244
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:21,580
We can probably buy some up here.

3245
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:23,180
Maybe, yeah.

3246
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,040
Let me use my skill points.

3247
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:26,500
Oh man!

3248
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,300
We are rich in skill points.

3249
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:29,200
We are!

3250
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,780
Nice work down there.

3251
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,200
Good news is...

3252
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,200
I got some folks coming for me in a bus.

3253
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:36,440
Any minute now.

3254
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:39,780
If we can make it on board, it's a straight shot to Tall Oaks Cathedral.

3255
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:40,840
Is he gonna take us too?

3256
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:42,900
I don't know.

3257
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,740
Does she look okay to you?

3258
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,720
We ain't waiting for any stragglers.

3259
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:48,940
Her eyes are glowing a little bit.

3260
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:49,820
Yeah!

3261
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,360
Is that normal?

3262
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:55,740
Japanese dude!

3263
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:03,530
Gramps.

3264
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,320
There's a guy?

3265
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:19,160
There's a big guy in here.

3266
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,980
Zombies are going after each other now too.

3267
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

3268
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:53,960
Ah!

3269
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:57,820
Ha ya!

3270
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:58,720
Ha ya!

3271
01:50:59,280 --> 01:50:59,480
Ha ya!

3272
01:50:59,480 --> 01:50:59,840
Oh my god!

3273
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:00,380
Fuel!

3274
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:01,700
Fuel point!

3275
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:02,420
Yeah!

3276
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:03,320
Nice!

3277
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,060
Yeah!

3278
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,900
Stop making so much noise over here!

3279
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:11,980
More!

3280
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,080
When does it end?

3281
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,720
Aren't we supposed to close the shutters?

3282
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,160
I don't know.

3283
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:23,280
It didn't say anything.

3284
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,180
I think we just...

3285
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,180
Survive.

3286
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:27,140
Oh!

3287
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:27,400
Oh!

3288
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:27,920
There you go!

3289
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:29,880
Wait!

3290
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,040
There's still a guy in here!

3291
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:33,000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3292
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:33,600
Come on people!

3293
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Ha ha ha ha!

3294
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:37,940
There we go.

3295
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,180
Oh my gosh!

3296
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,060
Anything else?

3297
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:44,740
Oh!

3298
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:48,300
Don't forget to combine your herbs.

3299
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,100
Yeah, yeah.

3300
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,700
There's actually quite a bit in here.

3301
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:52,240
We're just...

3302
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:52,340
Oh!

3303
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,360
What is this?

3304
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:55,580
Ha ha!

3305
01:51:59,260 --> 01:51:59,780
Oh!

3306
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,380
They better let us shop!

3307
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:01,940
I know!

3308
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:04,560
They can't just tease us with the idea of a shop!

3309
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:09,040
Ew!

3310
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,020
Oh!

3311
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,120
There's someone right outside the window!

3312
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:13,900
Uh oh!

3313
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:17,080
Wait!

3314
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,960
Why did you blow open the window?

3315
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:21,560
Old man is just standing there.

3316
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,220
He doesn't care at all.

3317
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,020
He doesn't care at all.

3318
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:27,580
Is this an earthquake?

3319
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:29,260
Oh!

3320
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,260
Big one!

3321
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:32,440
A hunker!

3322
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:32,960
Oh no!

3323
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,560
Oh my gosh!

3324
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:36,220
Oh my gosh!

3325
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,200
Take

3326
01:52:43,510 --> 01:52:43,790
a medicine!

3327
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:44,130
Oh my gosh!

3328
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:45,130
He's too flexed me!

3329
01:52:45,450 --> 01:52:45,950
Oh my gosh!

3330
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,470
Pulled out of

3331
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:51,340
the...

3332
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:52,320
A chute on this man!

3333
01:52:52,540 --> 01:52:53,460
He's so choppy!

3334
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:53,920
He's gonna be in the corner!

3335
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,440
He's gonna bring this whole place down on us!

3336
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:56,280
His...

3337
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,240
Tits are huge!

3338
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:04,110
He's wearing a diaper, I think!

3339
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:19,980
It's okay.

3340
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:21,580
I think it's...

3341
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:22,300
Right at this point.

3342
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,160
I hope...

3343
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:24,860
It better be.

3344
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:26,740
Yeah.

3345
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:27,500
Now I'm...

3346
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:27,760
Now I'm ready.

3347
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:28,540
Now I'm prepared.

3348
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:30,920
I don't know if I'm prepared for that thing!

3349
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,220
That guy was huge!

3350
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:32,940
Oh!

3351
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,520
I know!

3352
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:35,880
It's such a small room!

3353
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:36,580
It is!

3354
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:41,460
Woo!

3355
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:42,260
Dammit!

3356
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:43,320
Any more waste?

3357
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,380
The floor's gonna collapse!

3358
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,480
The floor's gonna collapse!

3359
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,440
I need to dodge both.

3360
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,520
Oh yeah, I forgot that's a thing.

3361
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,660
Come on, you become a jen!

3362
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:57,680
Yeah!

3363
01:53:58,800 --> 01:53:59,200
Ha ha ha!

3364
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,000
Somebody's standing in the other room!

3365
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:02,880
Ow!

3366
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:03,120
Ow!

3367
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:04,820
He's gonna bring this whole place down on us!

3368
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:05,220
Oh wait!

3369
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,240
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

3370
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,300
Just unload on him!

3371
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,080
Reload please!

3372
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:15,980
Oh!

3373
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:16,460
Is he down there?

3374
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:17,600
I think he's down!

3375
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:18,420
I think he's down!

3376
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:19,180
Come on!

3377
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:19,640
Move it!

3378
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:20,080
Move it!

3379
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,660
Oh, don't forget the skill points!

3380
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:23,660
Oh, there's a zombie right here?

3381
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh!

3382
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:26,980
Oh, nice one!

3383
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,100
My skill points!

3384
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:34,160
Wait, I didn't get to get the herb!

3385
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:42,340
I want my money!

3386
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:43,460
Can I get the herb still?

3387
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,160
I think I gotta...I gotta combine mine.

3388
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:47,520
Oh, I can't!

3389
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:48,020
Wait...

3390
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:50,700
I'm too...I have too much...not enough space.

3391
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:52,660
Wait, if I put this in my slot...

3392
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,760
Hold on, I'm still trying to figure out how to do this.

3393
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,640
My...my inventory is full of ammo.

3394
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:01,520
Yeah, me too!

3395
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,060
Okay, now I can combine.

3396
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:09,500
Oh my god!

3397
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:12,040
Get outta here!

3398
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:14,220
There's still guys coming!

3399
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:15,540
There's always guys!

3400
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:19,420
Is there stuff in here?

3401
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,080
Oh, there's grenades in here!

3402
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:22,640
Oh!

3403
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:23,920
Oh!

3404
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:24,320
Oops!

3405
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:26,780
Never prepared!

3406
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:33,570
The kicks are just so satisfying!

3407
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:34,270
I know!

3408
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:37,310
Okay, so then I click E and I click...

3409
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:39,570
Combine...

3410
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:40,250
Okay!

3411
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:41,370
Nice!

3412
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:42,290
Alright!

3413
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,370
Alright!

3414
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:45,150
Now I'm ready!

3415
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:46,230
Okay!

3416
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,290
Are you gonna shut it, old man?

3417
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:50,210
Or...

3418
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:51,310
Is this it?

3419
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:52,970
No, we'll get around to it.

3420
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:54,230
Oh yeah, there's some grenades in there.

3421
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:55,230
Yeah, I didn't even check in here.

3422
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:55,870
Okay, nice.

3423
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:57,030
I need to use...

3424
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:58,210
How do I use my grenades?

3425
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:00,130
I don't know how to swap.

3426
01:56:03,010 --> 01:56:03,490
Um...

3427
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:03,850
Hmm...

3428
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:05,950
Should be same as how you swap your weapon.

3429
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:07,290
It's like...

3430
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:08,550
A different menu though, I think.

3431
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:10,570
It means...

3432
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:12,290
One is up, down, and one's left, right.

3433
01:56:13,730 --> 01:56:14,050
Oop!

3434
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,620
Now it feels like the...

3435
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:21,120
Left 4 Dead party, for real.

3436
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:24,780
We got old man.

3437
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:25,900
Uh huh.

3438
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,880
Oh my god!

3439
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:36,380
Help him!

3440
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:37,440
Anybody gonna help him?

3441
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,900
They're helping him.

3442
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:39,860
They all ran to him.

3443
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:40,560
Oh no!

3444
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:41,260
Oh no!

3445
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,000
Big baby!

3446
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:42,640
Big baby!

3447
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:49,100
He's so heroic!

3448
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:49,660
I know.

3449
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:51,980
He just met us too.

3450
01:57:10,710 --> 01:57:11,150
Fast.

3451
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:11,970
Yeah.

3452
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:12,770
Oh!

3453
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:15,290
Oh my god!

3454
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:16,330
Where did you come from?

3455
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:17,370
That guy's on fire!

3456
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:18,330
He's on fire!

3457
01:57:19,030 --> 01:57:19,710
Oh my gosh.

3458
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,250
I'm reloading right in front of him.

3459
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:23,310
Ow!

3460
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:28,570
We're fine.

3461
01:57:28,690 --> 01:57:29,210
Everything is fine.

3462
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:29,590
Is that our...

3463
01:57:29,590 --> 01:57:30,670
Is that our ride?

3464
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:31,730
Is that our Uber driver?

3465
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:32,850
That's our...

3466
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:33,830
Oh Uber driver, is

3467
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:37,290
he...

3468
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:37,830
Oh my gosh!

3469
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:39,130
Please stop knocking me down.

3470
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:41,090
You're obsessed with me, or something mister.

3471
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:45,510
There we go.

3472
01:57:46,330 --> 01:57:46,510
Yeah.

3473
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:48,750
Take my skill...

3474
01:57:50,130 --> 01:57:51,130
Oh no!

3475
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:53,630
I run, and I run.

3476
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:56,010
And I grab, and I run.

3477
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:58,730
I'm going down.

3478
01:57:58,950 --> 01:57:59,290
Me too.

3479
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:00,470
I'm right behind ya.

3480
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:03,750
I don't like that the sewer is open here.

3481
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:07,070
It makes me think we're gonna have to go back in.

3482
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:09,470
Something's gonna happen to the bus.

3483
01:58:09,650 --> 01:58:11,110
It'll explode spontaneously.

3484
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:14,290
Oh, here it is.

3485
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:17,010
Oh, the baby!

3486
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:20,470
There's someone walking our way.

3487
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:22,190
Oh, we gotta shoot the baby.

3488
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:24,710
Big baby.

3489
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:26,150
Come on.

3490
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:30,840
Why is everybody else going to the cathedral too?

3491
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:31,720
I know.

3492
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,400
I would get out of town.

3493
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:35,520
Oh god.

3494
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:36,700
Oh, I'm out?

3495
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:37,140
Oh, shoot.

3496
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:42,880
You know what?

3497
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:44,620
Maybe this gun is the best for this.

3498
01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:51,950
Oh my god.

3499
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:52,930
Oh my god.

3500
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:53,530
Oh my god.

3501
01:58:53,530 --> 01:58:53,790
Oh my god.

3502
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:58,130
What happened?

3503
01:58:58,350 --> 01:59:00,270
There's really crazy stuff going on.

3504
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:06,210
You did it.

3505
01:59:06,330 --> 01:59:07,290
Did the old man die?

3506
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:08,510
I think so.

3507
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:09,190
I don't know.

3508
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:19,240
That can't be good for the undercarriage of the bus.

3509
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:24,860
Who will think of the condition of the bus?

3510
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:30,000
Oh my gosh.

3511
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:30,840
Wow.

3512
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:32,420
Wow.

3513
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:34,140
Oh, I earned a dog tag.

3514
01:59:34,140 --> 01:59:35,460
I've got six deaths.

3515
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,940
You only have two.

3516
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,140
Oh, I forgot I'm Helena.

3517
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:41,040
I was like, wow.

3518
01:59:44,910 --> 01:59:45,870
Rank A.

3519
01:59:46,170 --> 01:59:47,290
Look at our enemies.

3520
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,470
They're so close.

3521
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:50,150
It's true.

3522
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:53,170
I'm at... My big head's blocking it.

3523
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:53,650
No, it's okay.

3524
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:55,450
I'm at 191.

3525
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:59,230
And... 192.

3526
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:00,910
192 for Nimi.

3527
02:00:01,410 --> 02:00:01,770
What?

3528
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:03,490
How many chapters are there?

3529
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:05,730
I don't know.

3530
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:07,070
I don't know.

3531
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:09,010
I didn't realize that... That was only one chapter.

3532
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:09,630
I know.

3533
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:10,750
It was so long.

3534
02:00:11,450 --> 02:00:13,650
I thought it was just gonna keep going forever.

3535
02:00:13,810 --> 02:00:14,710
Are we just slow?

3536
02:00:15,150 --> 02:00:15,630
You know?

3537
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:16,710
I don't know.

3538
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:17,450
I don't know.

3539
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:18,810
Four chapters?

3540
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:21,090
Oh, people are saying five or six.

3541
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:23,070
Okay.

3542
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:23,590
That's not fun.

3543
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:28,170
Chapter one is long.

3544
02:00:28,770 --> 02:00:30,890
Next chapter is also crazy long.

3545
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:32,150
Five in total.

3546
02:00:33,890 --> 02:00:34,910
What do you want to do?

3547
02:00:35,650 --> 02:00:37,330
I could do another one.

3548
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:38,770
How long is crazy long?

3549
02:00:38,910 --> 02:00:39,570
Like this long?

3550
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:40,290
Yeah.

3551
02:00:40,350 --> 02:00:40,350
Yeah.

3552
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:41,370
Is it like two hours long?

3553
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:42,410
Or like five hours?

3554
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:44,130
Maybe we need to go faster.

3555
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:44,690
Maybe we need to go faster.

3556
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:48,330
They're all long?

3557
02:00:48,690 --> 02:00:49,810
They're all long.

3558
02:00:51,810 --> 02:00:53,170
Three to four hours?

3559
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,350
Three?

3560
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,050
I can't tell when... Did you pause in the middle of it?

3561
02:00:58,290 --> 02:00:59,070
I know, right?

3562
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:01,350
I can't tell when they're pulling our leg or not.

3563
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:03,670
Game is just long.

3564
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:04,690
I did look it up after.

3565
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:06,930
And it said like the campaign was like 20 hours.

3566
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:08,050
20 to 30 hours.

3567
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:09,110
Really?

3568
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:10,570
I thought it was only like 12.

3569
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:13,970
I thought it would be shorter because it's co-op, right?

3570
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:15,130
Yeah.

3571
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:16,330
Hmm.

3572
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:19,970
Well, we can pause in the middle of it.

3573
02:01:20,490 --> 02:01:20,930
Oh, we can?

3574
02:01:21,050 --> 02:01:21,370
I think.

3575
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:22,110
Yeah.

3576
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:24,470
Oh, it says... Yeah.

3577
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:26,190
They'll say it'll check point and you can continue.

3578
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:26,710
Okay.

3579
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:28,930
And we keep going.

3580
02:01:29,390 --> 02:01:29,530
Yeah.

3581
02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:30,110
Let's keep going.

3582
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:32,310
And then when we feel like we're done, we can just...

3583
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:32,670
Yeah.

3584
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:38,350
We'll like check... I guess that's for... It's maybe 30 hours for all the campaigns.

3585
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:42,050
The on campaign is 10 hours.

3586
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:47,310
Ah... Ah... Really?

3587
02:01:47,590 --> 02:01:47,810
Okay.

3588
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:50,050
Wait, can we buy skills?

3589
02:01:50,830 --> 02:01:51,790
Oh, yeah.

3590
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:56,130
I clicked... Continue and it's not doing anything.

3591
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:58,950
Oh, I probably have to continue also.

3592
02:01:58,950 --> 02:01:59,310
Oh.

3593
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:00,610
Oh, what can we buy?

3594
02:02:00,850 --> 02:02:00,910
Oh!

3595
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:01,750
Oh!

3596
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:04,710
Yippee!

3597
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:08,650
Oh my gosh, this is... You can lock on!

3598
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:12,430
Wait...

3599
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:13,030
Melee!

3600
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:13,930
You need that one.

3601
02:02:13,930 --> 02:02:15,210
I have to get melee.

3602
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:16,630
Yeah, you have to get that one.

3603
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:18,890
Oh, that's like all of my points.

3604
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:19,850
I know.

3605
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:21,550
How many points do you have?

3606
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:24,090
Uh, 13,000.

3607
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:28,090
Rocksteady.

3608
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:29,050
That's all my points.

3609
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:30,290
Reduces recoil.

3610
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:31,550
I might do that one.

3611
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:33,450
Critical hit.

3612
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:35,850
I wish I had enough for piercing.

3613
02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:39,790
I know, I almost have enough to get defense too.

3614
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,990
Oh!

3615
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:45,430
Maybe I'll get like some of...

3616
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:48,810
Maybe defense.

3617
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,090
Scroll down, there's more.

3618
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:56,110
Oh, there is more!

3619
02:02:56,330 --> 02:02:56,850
Oh, there is more!

3620
02:02:56,850 --> 02:02:57,330
Oh!

3621
02:02:58,390 --> 02:02:59,650
Oh, I was like...

3622
02:02:59,650 --> 02:03:01,110
I didn't see the scroll right here.

3623
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:02,330
I mean...

3624
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:03,410
Wait, there's a lot more.

3625
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:03,790
Yeah.

3626
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:05,570
Sniper rifle?

3627
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:05,950
Oh!

3628
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:07,910
Lone Wolf.

3629
02:03:08,230 --> 02:03:08,690
Keep...

3630
02:03:08,690 --> 02:03:10,950
Keeps your partner from helping you when you're in trouble.

3631
02:03:11,130 --> 02:03:12,110
That's so messed up!

3632
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:12,610
What?

3633
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:14,650
Don't...

3634
02:03:14,650 --> 02:03:15,730
Don't get that one.

3635
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:19,050
Oh yeah, I want the game to be more difficult.

3636
02:03:19,470 --> 02:03:19,650
Yeah!

3637
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:22,330
Lows you to easily break free.

3638
02:03:23,690 --> 02:03:24,490
Oh gosh.

3639
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:25,950
Wait, now there's so much more!

3640
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:27,150
Oh gosh.

3641
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:28,550
I know.

3642
02:03:30,130 --> 02:03:31,470
A lot of them are expensive.

3643
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:32,490
Yeah, they are.

3644
02:03:33,070 --> 02:03:34,570
Transcens your partner's attacks.

3645
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:36,230
Oh, single player only.

3646
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:36,730
Ah.

3647
02:03:36,930 --> 02:03:37,790
Single player only?

3648
02:03:38,170 --> 02:03:38,590
Whatever.

3649
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:43,430
Increases strength of attacks on a zombie.

3650
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:43,750
Wait.

3651
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:45,630
On a zombie.

3652
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:46,390
Not me.

3653
02:03:50,070 --> 02:03:52,750
Where do you see snipe block ones too?

3654
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:53,770
Yeah, me too.

3655
02:03:54,730 --> 02:03:55,750
I think eagle eye.

3656
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:58,110
Is this a sniper skill?

3657
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:04,690
I mean, zombie hunter seems good, right?

3658
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:06,730
We're fighting zombies, right?

3659
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:08,870
I'll get the eagle eye.

3660
02:04:09,370 --> 02:04:10,670
We need stamina.

3661
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:12,230
Is there a stamina one?

3662
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:15,330
Is there?

3663
02:04:16,070 --> 02:04:16,750
I don't know.

3664
02:04:17,790 --> 02:04:19,970
Oh yeah, stamina would be great, right?

3665
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:21,950
Yeah, it would be.

3666
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:24,370
Really increased...

3667
02:04:24,370 --> 02:04:25,230
Oh, I can't...

3668
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:26,170
I can't afford that.

3669
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:26,550
Com...

3670
02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:27,490
Oh, combat gauge.

3671
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:28,510
I don't have that!

3672
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:29,930
That's cost 70,000!

3673
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:30,490
Alright, to equip.

3674
02:04:31,730 --> 02:04:32,550
Thank you, guys.

3675
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:35,470
Yeah, don't forget to equip it once you buy it.

3676
02:04:35,630 --> 02:04:35,770
Yeah.

3677
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:36,630
Yes.

3678
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:37,050
Yeah.

3679
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:40,250
Maybe critical hit?

3680
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:42,110
Oh.

3681
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:44,610
I guess since you can only get three...

3682
02:04:45,230 --> 02:04:45,610
Yeah.

3683
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:46,310
...skills.

3684
02:04:46,610 --> 02:04:48,570
Maybe you should choose wisely.

3685
02:04:48,930 --> 02:04:49,370
I don't know.

3686
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:51,270
Maybe I'll just save my money.

3687
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:52,470
True.

3688
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:53,910
I'll get these too.

3689
02:04:53,950 --> 02:04:54,390
I don't know.

3690
02:04:54,710 --> 02:04:56,550
Because some of them you can like level up too.

3691
02:04:56,730 --> 02:04:58,930
I think those ones are good to invest in also.

3692
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:02,870
Because you can just keep leveling it up, but it stays in one slot.

3693
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:07,110
Maybe I will get defense.

3694
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:07,790
You know what?

3695
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:08,710
Let's get defense.

3696
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,490
Defense seems good.

3697
02:05:10,790 --> 02:05:10,950
Yeah.

3698
02:05:13,070 --> 02:05:14,970
I can always switch out something else.

3699
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,890
Cool.

3700
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:16,930
I'm ready.

3701
02:05:17,690 --> 02:05:18,450
I don't know.

3702
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:19,730
Now I want more...

3703
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:20,550
More money.

3704
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:21,290
I know.

3705
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:29,450
Can we get better weapons?

3706
02:05:29,870 --> 02:05:30,270
Ever?

3707
02:05:31,010 --> 02:05:32,830
Yeah, I want to buy weapons now too.

3708
02:05:33,530 --> 02:05:33,850
I know.

3709
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:35,190
This better be a good upgrade.

3710
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:36,590
This better be a big upgrade.

3711
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:38,490
Oh, Hitman's driving the car.

3712
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:51,810
Used!

3713
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:53,770
Not Neo Umbrella.

3714
02:05:53,950 --> 02:05:55,870
How was that Umbrella cord?

3715
02:06:00,990 --> 02:06:03,330
Oh, I thought we were in Raccoon City.

3716
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:04,850
Are you not so too?

3717
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:06,370
I don't know what's in that cathedral.

3718
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:07,630
I got suits breathing.

3719
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:08,270
We're not?

3720
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:09,630
Suits.

3721
02:06:10,150 --> 02:06:10,310
Oops.

3722
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:14,150
Specifically, Derek C.

3723
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:14,570
Simmons.

3724
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:16,730
National Security Advisor.

3725
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:17,790
Not Derek C.

3726
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:18,990
Oh, he looks like...

3727
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:20,410
He looks like, um...

3728
02:06:21,290 --> 02:06:22,150
The Green Devil.

3729
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:25,450
Don't call me then.

3730
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,720
Who is the Green Devil?

3731
02:06:37,110 --> 02:06:38,650
I meant the Green Devil!

3732
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:52,650
Legally Distinct Green Goblin.

3733
02:06:54,810 --> 02:06:57,050
I thought it didn't sound right.

3734
02:06:57,330 --> 02:06:59,010
But I couldn't remember it.

3735
02:07:05,990 --> 02:07:06,950
Oh dear.

3736
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:08,390
How did this happen?

3737
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:11,030
Oh my god, there's so many all of a sudden.

3738
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:11,530
Ah!

3739
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:13,530
Oh!

3740
02:07:16,090 --> 02:07:17,050
Back up!

3741
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:19,090
Oh, I can shoot.

3742
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:19,470
Oh!

3743
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:21,110
Wait, why can't I shoot anymore?

3744
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:21,890
We're going nowhere.

3745
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:22,090
We're going nowhere.

3746
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:22,190
We're going nowhere.

3747
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:23,170
You want to aim again, I think.

3748
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:23,810
Oh, okay.

3749
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:25,050
Face yourself!

3750
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:25,410
Whoa!

3751
02:07:26,110 --> 02:07:27,430
You just locked heads.

3752
02:07:33,860 --> 02:07:35,640
Why is it acting so strange?

3753
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:36,180
The camera.

3754
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,080
I know.

3755
02:07:38,300 --> 02:07:39,420
Classic cameras.

3756
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:41,680
No, not another car!

3757
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:43,900
Every time.

3758
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,660
These games are, like, insane.

3759
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:50,680
Where if something can go wrong, everything will go wrong.

3760
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:50,980
Right?

3761
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:54,140
I don't know.

3762
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,620
I'm thinking about, like, the appeal of this game.

3763
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:01,060
Because it is, it's very much like, action movie.

3764
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:02,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3765
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:07,660
Are there people who are like, I just want to play a game that's like, my favorite action movie.

3766
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,060
And you're, like, the hero.

3767
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:10,980
The protag.

3768
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:12,120
Yeah.

3769
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:16,080
Aw, no, I just...

3770
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:16,600
What's his name?

3771
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:17,140
47?

3772
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:18,800
Yeah.

3773
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,160
47.

3774
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:24,220
Oh, you were at the cathedral, though.

3775
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:25,400
Yeah.

3776
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:35,280
What's so special about the cathedral, anyway?

3777
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:36,940
She's obsessed.

3778
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:39,820
She is.

3779
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:42,420
Well, she's keeping it secret, right?

3780
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:44,060
She's like, I know the answer.

3781
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:44,600
Yeah.

3782
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:47,300
Ooh, this area's spooky.

3783
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:51,840
Yeah, this is supposed to be a horror game franchise.

3784
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:55,360
It's supposed to be.

3785
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:56,360
Yeah.

3786
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:57,580
Wait, what's around here?

3787
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:59,820
This area's spooky.

3788
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:01,000
I like it.

3789
02:09:02,180 --> 02:09:04,180
Oh, that's a big bird.

3790
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:04,920
Oh, watch out!

3791
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:06,880
Oh, oh, oh!

3792
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,880
Why did he jump over you to get to me?

3793
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:10,380
He did.

3794
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:13,580
He jumped right over me to get to you.

3795
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:20,740
Dang, you're making me take my medicine because of him.

3796
02:09:24,770 --> 02:09:25,230
Jeez.

3797
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:30,730
These are, like, advanced zombies.

3798
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:31,510
I'm expecting to be much stronger.

3799
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:32,210
I know.

3800
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:33,230
I hate it.

3801
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:33,650
What the fuck?

3802
02:09:33,950 --> 02:09:34,610
Are you okay?

3803
02:09:34,610 --> 02:09:35,050
He...

3804
02:09:36,330 --> 02:09:37,510
Oh my god!

3805
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:41,390
He just, like...

3806
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:45,250
I'm just in there now.

3807
02:09:45,530 --> 02:09:46,470
Oh my god!

3808
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:47,610
Oh, you got him.

3809
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:57,090
Was there anything in there?

3810
02:09:58,090 --> 02:09:58,650
No.

3811
02:09:58,870 --> 02:09:59,410
Just goop?

3812
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:00,810
Just goop.

3813
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:02,010
That was so funny.

3814
02:10:02,150 --> 02:10:04,210
You just slipped right on in.

3815
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:06,790
I thought I was supposed to be there.

3816
02:10:08,930 --> 02:10:10,790
With how it set me down.

3817
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:14,310
I can't tell exactly if I'm going the right way, but I guess it's all lit up.

3818
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:17,690
It's narrowed this way, so it's gotta be nice.

3819
02:10:17,690 --> 02:10:17,830
Nice.

3820
02:10:26,190 --> 02:10:26,690
Oh!

3821
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:29,710
Why do we always get flashbanged by the...

3822
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:29,870
I know.

3823
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:42,720
It's a good thing that the, you know, the bites don't infect you.

3824
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:43,320
I...

3825
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:43,540
Yeah.

3826
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:44,340
The...

3827
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:45,880
They don't even follow their own rules.

3828
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,780
Sucks that 70% of people got infected, but we're just built different.

3829
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:51,920
But we're just built different.

3830
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:52,160
Wait.

3831
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,020
I see it.

3832
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:54,820
Cathedral?

3833
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:55,980
What's in here, though?

3834
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:57,300
Is this something?

3835
02:10:58,920 --> 02:10:59,960
Is this anything?

3836
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:00,960
Oh.

3837
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:02,260
There's a guy behind you.

3838
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,560
Oh, you...

3839
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,060
Oh, wait.

3840
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:07,420
He just dropped to the ground and started crawling for no reason.

3841
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:10,360
It's...

3842
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:12,320
It's a big bed in here.

3843
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:12,900
Ooh!

3844
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:13,860
Ow!

3845
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:15,040
Oh, space.

3846
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:17,120
Oh, no.

3847
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:18,460
It's a gate.

3848
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:20,180
Nice.

3849
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:22,420
Oh, my gosh.

3850
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:24,120
Advanced zombies.

3851
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,520
You guys are just corpses.

3852
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,520
How are you still...

3853
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:28,300
Oh.

3854
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:28,920
Oh.

3855
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:30,840
That was freaky.

3856
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:32,680
That was freaky.

3857
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:33,020
Wait.

3858
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:34,000
How did I die?

3859
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:34,940
Oh, my gosh.

3860
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:35,260
I don't know.

3861
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:37,520
Did he explode or something?

3862
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:38,460
I don't know.

3863
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:39,600
Ow!

3864
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:40,840
Oh.

3865
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:41,900
How did I die?

3866
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:44,180
I was just taking medicine and I died.

3867
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,220
My bad.

3868
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:46,880
He hates you.

3869
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:48,160
Sorry.

3870
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:49,340
You're in a vendetta.

3871
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:50,140
I know.

3872
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:52,840
But did I get struck by...

3873
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:54,220
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3874
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:54,760
No way.

3875
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:55,740
We're all the way back here.

3876
02:11:55,860 --> 02:11:56,560
No, don't worry.

3877
02:11:56,820 --> 02:11:58,340
Just fast.

3878
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,360
We can just run.

3879
02:11:59,580 --> 02:11:59,800
Yeah.

3880
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:01,100
We can just run through it.

3881
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:02,040
To reach the cathedral.

3882
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,280
Do you actually get struck by lightning?

3883
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:06,880
I guess it is raining.

3884
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,340
I don't think that's real.

3885
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:13,200
The lightning is a zombie too.

3886
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:15,120
Oh, now there's no...

3887
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:16,280
There is lightning, I guess.

3888
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:17,400
Oh!

3889
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:18,140
Oh, my God!

3890
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:20,700
Oh, my God.

3891
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:23,720
There is lightning.

3892
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:24,640
There is.

3893
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:28,680
I'm running.

3894
02:12:28,940 --> 02:12:29,040
Run.

3895
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:29,460
Okay.

3896
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:31,380
Oh, they're all coming for you.

3897
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,140
Oh, my gosh.

3898
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:32,940
Wait.

3899
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:33,980
They're really coming for you.

3900
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:34,440
Oh!

3901
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:35,820
I just slipped into the wall.

3902
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:36,100
Oh.

3903
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:36,840
Oh, gosh.

3904
02:12:37,180 --> 02:12:37,360
Oh.

3905
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:38,420
Oh, God.

3906
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:44,960
It's terrible.

3907
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:47,380
I'm coming.

3908
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:48,140
I'm running.

3909
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:48,660
Just go.

3910
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:52,840
Oh.

3911
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:53,560
Oh, the humanity.

3912
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:58,840
We need some body spray stacked.

3913
02:12:59,820 --> 02:13:01,240
I think I have some still.

3914
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,760
Unless I accidentally used it.

3915
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:03,380
I don't remember.

3916
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:04,240
Wait.

3917
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:05,020
Was there stuff in here?

3918
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:06,320
There was.

3919
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:07,780
Just a grenade though.

3920
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:08,740
No, no, no.

3921
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:11,160
I wish we could take these...

3922
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:12,260
Those shovels or something.

3923
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:14,120
Yeah, right?

3924
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:15,240
Oh.

3925
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:16,380
Wait.

3926
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:17,820
Please.

3927
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:18,400
Wait.

3928
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:18,780
There it is.

3929
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:19,100
Okay.

3930
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:21,220
Uh-oh.

3931
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:21,920
Uh-oh.

3932
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:23,620
Oh, my God.

3933
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:24,680
He just ran.

3934
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:25,180
Okay.

3935
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:31,240
You know what?

3936
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:31,940
I'm just gonna shoot.

3937
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:33,100
Oh, my God.

3938
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:40,220
At least there's no lightning inside.

3939
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:40,920
True.

3940
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:48,040
I don't know how you're supposed to dodge the bolt of lightning from the sky.

3941
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:49,980
Oh, I'm sorry though.

3942
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:50,580
Oh.

3943
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:51,700
I'm sorry.

3944
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,540
It's locked.

3945
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:57,280
Just go over.

3946
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:58,520
Just go over.

3947
02:13:58,520 --> 02:13:58,660
Just climb it.

3948
02:13:58,700 --> 02:13:59,460
We'll figure something out.

3949
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,740
Maybe there's a key.

3950
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,420
That wouldn't be that hard to climb.

3951
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:03,660
A key somewhere.

3952
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:04,300
Oh.

3953
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:05,600
Did I get him?

3954
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:08,160
Oh, I did.

3955
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:09,560
Oh, in here?

3956
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:11,720
Key.

3957
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:12,220
Key.

3958
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:12,620
Key.

3959
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:17,340
Oh, I didn't even notice this door before.

3960
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:18,120
I didn't either.

3961
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:18,780
Come on.

3962
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:19,140
I'm trying.

3963
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:20,240
I'm trying.

3964
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:20,320
I'm trying.

3965
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:20,540
I'm trying.

3966
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:25,560
It's Hawaiian.

3967
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:26,900
Oh!

3968
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:28,600
Flog in the bathroom.

3969
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:29,520
Oh.

3970
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,020
I had one shot.

3971
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:31,780
He's leaving.

3972
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:35,680
I saw a skill over there.

3973
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:37,040
Dang.

3974
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:38,540
Well, we gotta go there.

3975
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:38,780
Toilet.

3976
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:40,220
Holy.

3977
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:42,400
Anybody would fall into that.

3978
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:43,980
Right?

3979
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,980
That happened to me once.

3980
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:46,980
I was at my grandpa's.

3981
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:48,200
No.

3982
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:49,460
And he...

3983
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:50,700
I was in the middle of the night.

3984
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:52,660
And he...

3985
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:56,300
So I didn't notice that he didn't put the toilet seat down.

3986
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:57,260
No.

3987
02:14:57,340 --> 02:14:58,340
Before I went to sleep.

3988
02:14:58,440 --> 02:14:59,560
And I was too tired to...

3989
02:14:59,560 --> 02:14:59,800
No.

3990
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:00,360
Oops.

3991
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:01,180
I did not know.

3992
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:03,360
I just fell right in.

3993
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:04,240
Oh, no.

3994
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,280
Oh.

3995
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,860
That's a true story, everybody.

3996
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:12,720
Were you a kid?

3997
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:13,960
Yeah, I was a kid.

3998
02:15:14,740 --> 02:15:14,820
Oh.

3999
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:15,260
Nice.

4000
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:18,560
Wait, did you get a key in here?

4001
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:19,920
Oh.

4002
02:15:20,680 --> 02:15:21,500
I don't know.

4003
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:22,240
No, I didn't see it.

4004
02:15:22,240 --> 02:15:22,800
I'm just clicking.

4005
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm just head empty.

4006
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,520
Oh, I think the dog is gonna throw up the key.

4007
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:28,640
Yeah.

4008
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:33,060
I guess there are worse things than chasing a dog through a cemetery.

4009
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:33,640
It's a hunt.

4010
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:34,240
Yeah.

4011
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:35,320
He could be chasing us.

4012
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:37,660
There we go.

4013
02:15:41,850 --> 02:15:43,030
We have to go around.

4014
02:15:44,270 --> 02:15:44,930
Oh, dog.

4015
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:46,650
Puppy.

4016
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:47,190
Oh, dog.

4017
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:57,240
They should have more.

4018
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:59,600
They should have dancing to the scene.

4019
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:00,440
They really should.

4020
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:02,620
Just make it a full, like...

4021
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:04,900
Um...

4022
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:06,760
Friday the 13th...

4023
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:07,240
Style.

4024
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:08,100
Yeah, yeah.

4025
02:16:11,620 --> 02:16:12,880
Why are they all...

4026
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:13,780
Oh my gosh.

4027
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,060
Don't fall in.

4028
02:16:16,180 --> 02:16:16,840
Ow!

4029
02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:19,000
Hey, dog.

4030
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:19,700
Hey.

4031
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:26,200
Oh, he's dead.

4032
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:26,760
Ah!

4033
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:31,960
I have a reoccurring nightmare.

4034
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:36,220
And everyone in my family also has the same reoccurring nightmare.

4035
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:37,120
What?

4036
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:40,060
That I need to use the bathroom.

4037
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:45,980
But the only bathroom is like a horrible, decrepit, horror movie bathroom.

4038
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:48,800
It's like filthy and dirty.

4039
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:49,180
Ah!

4040
02:16:51,260 --> 02:16:52,020
Oh, wow.

4041
02:16:52,140 --> 02:16:55,000
I never knew that a whole family could have recurring nightmares.

4042
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:55,920
The curse.

4043
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:57,820
The family curse.

4044
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:00,580
So did that...

4045
02:17:00,580 --> 02:17:02,280
Bathroom kind of trigger something?

4046
02:17:02,460 --> 02:17:03,300
Like a...

4047
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:05,500
I don't know.

4048
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:08,940
It's always a different bathroom, you know?

4049
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,120
Oh, this isn't out.

4050
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:10,600
This is the theme.

4051
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:12,500
Oh, this is the doll.

4052
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:13,480
I think so, yeah.

4053
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:17,340
It's blowing...

4054
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:18,920
It's...

4055
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:20,240
Oh, my gosh.

4056
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:21,300
Get back here!

4057
02:17:21,740 --> 02:17:21,860
Oh, no!

4058
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:22,000
Oh, no!

4059
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:23,260
Oh,

4060
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:31,120
gosh.

4061
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:32,340
Lots of zombies coming in.

4062
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:33,260
Oh, he...

4063
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:33,840
He ran...

4064
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:34,920
He ran back this way.

4065
02:17:37,140 --> 02:17:38,540
Like, towards the cathedral.

4066
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:41,440
He's just running everywhere.

4067
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,260
Taking us on a wild dog chase.

4068
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:54,650
Booty shot.

4069
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:55,470
Booty shot.

4070
02:17:56,010 --> 02:17:56,150
Ah!

4071
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:59,390
Got him.

4072
02:18:00,330 --> 02:18:01,870
Wait, did he leave anything behind?

4073
02:18:04,270 --> 02:18:04,630
No.

4074
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:05,490
Oh!

4075
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:06,270
Oh, my God!

4076
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:13,210
Gotta make sure...

4077
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:13,790
Good job, Leon.

4078
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:18,390
Oh, my goodness.

4079
02:18:23,370 --> 02:18:23,970
Nice.

4080
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:25,930
He kicked his head off.

4081
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:30,250
He just got no brains.

4082
02:18:30,530 --> 02:18:31,830
No thoughts about it.

4083
02:18:32,330 --> 02:18:33,210
Head empty.

4084
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:33,690
Head empty.

4085
02:18:33,790 --> 02:18:33,870
Head empty.

4086
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:34,110
It's open.

4087
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:34,830
Let's move.

4088
02:18:35,070 --> 02:18:35,170
Oh.

4089
02:18:38,030 --> 02:18:39,070
Why couldn't he...

4090
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:39,710
He kicked so dramatically.

4091
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:40,790
Oh!

4092
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:41,010
Oh!

4093
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:42,610
Oh!

4094
02:18:42,970 --> 02:18:43,910
Oh, my God!

4095
02:18:44,550 --> 02:18:44,970
Leon!

4096
02:18:44,970 --> 02:18:46,290
Where are you dying?

4097
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:49,610
Where are you dying?

4098
02:18:49,950 --> 02:18:50,550
Oh, no!

4099
02:18:50,830 --> 02:18:51,310
Are you okay?

4100
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:53,190
Why don't I go down there?

4101
02:18:54,110 --> 02:18:54,890
You never know.

4102
02:18:55,390 --> 02:18:55,770
Meet me at the cathedral.

4103
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:57,010
They want us separated.

4104
02:18:57,350 --> 02:18:58,450
Meet me at the cathedral.

4105
02:18:59,710 --> 02:18:59,830
Okay.

4106
02:19:01,970 --> 02:19:02,570
Oh...

4107
02:19:02,570 --> 02:19:03,150
Oh...

4108
02:19:03,150 --> 02:19:03,470
No!

4109
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:04,610
A little help!

4110
02:19:05,010 --> 02:19:06,810
Are you asking for help?

4111
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:07,350
A little help!

4112
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:08,470
A little help!

4113
02:19:11,070 --> 02:19:11,670
Oh...

4114
02:19:12,470 --> 02:19:13,650
I'm just gonna run.

4115
02:19:13,890 --> 02:19:14,010
We're together.

4116
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:17,310
I don't have very many of these bullets, so...

4117
02:19:17,310 --> 02:19:18,510
Where do I go?

4118
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:22,790
Oh, good, I got some more bullets.

4119
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:24,970
Oh, there's a cool door.

4120
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:30,350
This looks like the snake temple.

4121
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:32,350
Whoa, what?

4122
02:19:33,450 --> 02:19:34,050
Uh-oh.

4123
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:35,730
Wait, where am I?

4124
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:38,330
Okay, I think I go...

4125
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:43,650
Ew, why are you crying?

4126
02:19:44,310 --> 02:19:44,670
Ew.

4127
02:19:45,390 --> 02:19:46,910
I might be in trouble.

4128
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:48,110
Oh no, let me know!

4129
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:50,690
Oh, it's this guy.

4130
02:19:53,050 --> 02:19:55,310
Oh, he's got his final scream.

4131
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:57,190
Shut up.

4132
02:19:57,290 --> 02:19:58,350
Shut up, mister.

4133
02:20:00,090 --> 02:20:01,290
Give me your points.

4134
02:20:01,750 --> 02:20:02,930
What are you doing?

4135
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:05,030
I'm killing zombies.

4136
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:07,130
Actually, my side is pretty peaceful.

4137
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:08,290
All things considered.

4138
02:20:10,250 --> 02:20:11,450
There's something over here.

4139
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:17,030
I'm also killing zombies.

4140
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:19,290
Got the big guy!

4141
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:21,550
Yeah, I've got some big guys, too.

4142
02:20:26,490 --> 02:20:28,390
Oh, I'm hiding them.

4143
02:20:29,850 --> 02:20:30,650
Oh, shoot!

4144
02:20:30,910 --> 02:20:31,250
Oh, no!

4145
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:35,170
What the hell was that?

4146
02:20:35,610 --> 02:20:36,370
Was that you?

4147
02:20:37,250 --> 02:20:38,890
I think I got hit with lightning.

4148
02:20:39,190 --> 02:20:39,970
I think so, too!

4149
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:41,310
I think I'm down.

4150
02:20:41,550 --> 02:20:42,070
Are you down?

4151
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:58,390
There was I think right before...

4152
02:20:58,390 --> 02:21:00,250
Okay, well we got separated.

4153
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:00,870
Yeah, yeah.

4154
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:03,270
Oh yeah, here I am.

4155
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:05,090
There you are.

4156
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:08,450
Oh.

4157
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:08,930
Reload?

4158
02:21:10,270 --> 02:21:10,770
You never know.

4159
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:12,090
Meet me at the cathedral.

4160
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:14,150
The cathedral?

4161
02:21:14,650 --> 02:21:15,230
Oh, nice.

4162
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:18,170
If I'm nice and close, it only takes one shot.

4163
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:22,590
Are you doing all melee?

4164
02:21:23,050 --> 02:21:23,810
Is that what's happening?

4165
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,670
No, no.

4166
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:29,750
I've finally broken out the shotgun.

4167
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:30,730
All right.

4168
02:21:32,050 --> 02:21:32,910
Proud of you.

4169
02:21:33,890 --> 02:21:35,630
Going out of your comfort zone.

4170
02:21:35,870 --> 02:21:36,090
Yeah.

4171
02:21:36,090 --> 02:21:36,470
I am.

4172
02:21:37,170 --> 02:21:39,110
I can't let the team down.

4173
02:21:40,650 --> 02:21:42,490
When I'm all on my lonesome.

4174
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:49,130
Let me see your face.

4175
02:21:49,330 --> 02:21:50,030
Big guy.

4176
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:52,330
He's not that big.

4177
02:21:52,630 --> 02:21:53,310
I guess.

4178
02:21:55,450 --> 02:21:56,570
Oh, I have no bullet.

4179
02:21:56,650 --> 02:21:57,470
He's kind of scared.

4180
02:21:58,350 --> 02:21:59,450
Please give bullet.

4181
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:01,730
Oh, you give skill points.

4182
02:22:05,710 --> 02:22:06,610
Oh my god.

4183
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:08,390
Horror game.

4184
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:09,530
Horror game for real.

4185
02:22:14,450 --> 02:22:15,210
We're okay.

4186
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:15,950
Oh.

4187
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:17,210
Oh, stop.

4188
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:20,490
Oh, I hear him.

4189
02:22:20,690 --> 02:22:22,110
I can hear him all the way from here.

4190
02:22:24,250 --> 02:22:24,850
Oh.

4191
02:22:25,150 --> 02:22:25,150
Oh.

4192
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,190
Finish him.

4193
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:27,610
Finish him.

4194
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:29,690
Finish him.

4195
02:22:33,330 --> 02:22:34,370
Oh, shoot.

4196
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:36,010
Every time.

4197
02:22:36,330 --> 02:22:38,110
Every time they jump.

4198
02:22:38,330 --> 02:22:39,490
I hate the leapers.

4199
02:22:40,190 --> 02:22:40,190
Oh, shoot.

4200
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:54,300
Why is he running so fast?

4201
02:22:55,460 --> 02:22:56,280
Oh god.

4202
02:22:56,960 --> 02:22:58,280
My aim is bad.

4203
02:22:59,060 --> 02:22:59,980
Oh, I got him though.

4204
02:23:00,860 --> 02:23:01,500
Somehow.

4205
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:05,000
No.

4206
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,280
He's like crying.

4207
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:07,160
This guy.

4208
02:23:07,160 --> 02:23:07,720
I know.

4209
02:23:08,060 --> 02:23:09,620
The ones that are like... They're kind of big.

4210
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:11,600
And he like runs away and cries.

4211
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:15,960
Kind of relatable.

4212
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:19,360
Are you okay?

4213
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:20,720
From nowhere.

4214
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:21,860
Yeah.

4215
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:22,900
I'm going inside now.

4216
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:24,460
Going in?

4217
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:26,600
There was some sort of door.

4218
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:30,760
No, no, no.

4219
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:31,800
Oh, no.

4220
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:33,360
I need backup.

4221
02:23:33,580 --> 02:23:33,940
Oh, wait.

4222
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:34,440
I'm coming.

4223
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:34,780
Oh, wait.

4224
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:36,360
I think I go this way towards you.

4225
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,120
Wait.

4226
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,060
I think I'm close to you.

4227
02:23:39,740 --> 02:23:40,580
I hear you.

4228
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:41,540
Oh, no.

4229
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:43,280
Oh, my gosh.

4230
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:43,820
There you are.

4231
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:44,760
I see you.

4232
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:50,390
I've come to you this whole time.

4233
02:23:50,390 --> 02:23:51,330
I'm so sorry.

4234
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:52,970
Oh, it's okay.

4235
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:55,690
Do you need some axe spray?

4236
02:23:56,630 --> 02:23:57,090
I do.

4237
02:23:57,810 --> 02:23:58,070
Wait.

4238
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,850
I think I have some.

4239
02:23:59,090 --> 02:24:00,770
I just got to figure out how to use it.

4240
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:06,130
Do you think there's herbs in the cemetery?

4241
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:10,710
How do I give to her?

4242
02:24:11,490 --> 02:24:11,850
Oh!

4243
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:12,930
You might not be able to.

4244
02:24:13,250 --> 02:24:14,110
If you can't.

4245
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:15,190
If you don't see it.

4246
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:16,270
No!

4247
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:19,950
I think it usually pops up if you can.

4248
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:20,650
Oh, no.

4249
02:24:21,390 --> 02:24:21,910
Don't worry.

4250
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:25,090
I'll live until the next checkpoint at least.

4251
02:24:27,250 --> 02:24:27,950
Oh, yeah.

4252
02:24:28,130 --> 02:24:29,250
Here's the locked door.

4253
02:24:30,130 --> 02:24:31,130
Oh, okay.

4254
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:31,350
Okay.

4255
02:24:31,810 --> 02:24:33,250
I don't know where we're supposed to go.

4256
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:34,170
There was another...

4257
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:37,030
I think you follow where I was up here.

4258
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:37,490
Okay.

4259
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,180
Wait, I have...

4260
02:24:43,180 --> 02:24:43,580
Oh, my gosh.

4261
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:44,300
I do have sprays.

4262
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,740
I didn't realize that's how you use it.

4263
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:49,480
Oh!

4264
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:49,820
Oh, yay!

4265
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:52,060
Oh, I have sprays.

4266
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:58,900
Oh, my gosh.

4267
02:24:59,500 --> 02:24:59,900
Buddy.

4268
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,040
Do I get to collect your loot, too?

4269
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:03,500
Yeah.

4270
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:05,460
I've been taking your stuff.

4271
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:08,160
You can go around.

4272
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:09,940
I fought a couple guys.

4273
02:25:10,980 --> 02:25:13,280
So, there should be some big, like...

4274
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:13,680
Okay.

4275
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:14,280
Big monies.

4276
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:16,080
Big money.

4277
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:16,680
Yeah.

4278
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:17,460
Big money.

4279
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:17,980
I'm lost.

4280
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:18,560
It's okay.

4281
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:19,440
I'm with you.

4282
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:20,760
I'll lead you back home.

4283
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:21,340
Oh!

4284
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,700
Hey, I totally cleared this area.

4285
02:25:25,460 --> 02:25:26,880
I think they keep respawning.

4286
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:27,680
I think so, too.

4287
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:28,740
They're tricky.

4288
02:25:33,270 --> 02:25:35,230
I think over here...

4289
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:36,070
There was some more.

4290
02:25:36,690 --> 02:25:37,210
Unless...

4291
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:38,450
Maybe, actually, you got it.

4292
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:39,310
Oh.

4293
02:25:41,070 --> 02:25:41,590
Oh!

4294
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:43,430
I watched him just walk out of there!

4295
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:45,790
They do just walk out of there!

4296
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:45,970
Yeah, they're spawning.

4297
02:25:46,790 --> 02:25:46,990
Oh!

4298
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:48,250
Oh!

4299
02:25:50,050 --> 02:25:50,330
Oh.

4300
02:25:51,330 --> 02:25:51,710
It's okay.

4301
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:53,050
I'm coming.

4302
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:53,730
I got him.

4303
02:25:58,300 --> 02:25:59,600
We're doing farm.

4304
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:00,640
Skill point.

4305
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:01,680
Infinitely.

4306
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:03,380
That's true.

4307
02:26:03,560 --> 02:26:04,920
This is a great, like...

4308
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:05,840
Farm.

4309
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:09,060
You wanna lose your mind.

4310
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:12,600
I think we go to the right here.

4311
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:13,660
Yeah.

4312
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:14,820
I haven't been up here yet.

4313
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:17,060
Oh, yeah.

4314
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4315
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:21,960
Oh, flirt?

4316
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,780
You coming into this cathedral with me, or what?

4317
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:26,360
Ooh!

4318
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:26,900
Ooh!

4319
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,140
They're so aggressive.

4320
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:33,220
Just open the door.

4321
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:34,760
I know!

4322
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:35,640
Hurry!

4323
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:36,920
Oh, we got a checkpoint.

4324
02:26:37,060 --> 02:26:37,380
Let's go.

4325
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:38,120
There's a box!

4326
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:38,980
Yeah, there's a box!

4327
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:40,720
You got this?

4328
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:44,660
And a grenade?

4329
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:45,540
Yeah.

4330
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:46,120
Grenade?

4331
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:48,460
I could go for some health spray.

4332
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,700
More box.

4333
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:52,960
I will one day figure out...

4334
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:54,780
How to use the grenade.

4335
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:55,440
There's another grenade?

4336
02:26:58,880 --> 02:26:59,360
Stupid!

4337
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:04,260
Laugh at him!

4338
02:27:04,380 --> 02:27:06,140
Oh, they just fall to the ground.

4339
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:16,340
Guys, did you know that Nimi and I will have a cover come out soon-ish?

4340
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:19,080
And at the beginning, Nimi does a really cute laugh.

4341
02:27:20,680 --> 02:27:21,800
Oh, thank you!

4342
02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:25,420
You're very cute in the whole song!

4343
02:27:25,740 --> 02:27:26,420
I'm so excited!

4344
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:28,080
No, you're cute in the whole song!

4345
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:30,700
You picked a good song.

4346
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:35,300
I thought it would be so perfect for...

4347
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:36,940
It felt like it fit us.

4348
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:37,660
It was so fun.

4349
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:41,040
Uh-oh.

4350
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,160
Oh my gosh, I'm drinking my water!

4351
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:46,400
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

4352
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:47,380
I'm using grenades!

4353
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:48,620
Okay, use grenades.

4354
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:51,240
That wasn't a grenade.

4355
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:04,820
There we go.

4356
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:06,240
Grenade, grenade!

4357
02:28:06,460 --> 02:28:06,920
Grenade, grenade!

4358
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:10,020
Is he even doing anything?

4359
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:11,620
Ah!

4360
02:28:14,330 --> 02:28:15,190
This grenade?

4361
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:16,850
The church bell?

4362
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:18,030
Are you kidding me?

4363
02:28:18,210 --> 02:28:19,910
Yeah, why is he bringing the church bell?

4364
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:23,470
Why would you do this to us?

4365
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:23,830
Mister?

4366
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:25,070
Yeah.

4367
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:27,170
Wee!

4368
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:30,690
It's very Walking Dead.

4369
02:28:31,530 --> 02:28:31,990
Yeah!

4370
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:38,780
Are we gonna get blown up by...

4371
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:39,700
Hope is one!

4372
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:41,040
Yeah, this guy.

4373
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:42,600
This guy's icky.

4374
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:44,840
Oh, shoot.

4375
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:46,840
Please, reload faster!

4376
02:28:49,410 --> 02:28:49,780
See?

4377
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:51,520
Oh, come on, I got pushed!

4378
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:54,290
Yes!

4379
02:28:57,780 --> 02:28:58,590
Get his ass!

4380
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:01,610
Oh god.

4381
02:29:02,770 --> 02:29:03,570
Where's that?

4382
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:04,550
Oh my god!

4383
02:29:05,050 --> 02:29:05,450
What?

4384
02:29:05,530 --> 02:29:06,590
The sniper rifle?

4385
02:29:08,470 --> 02:29:10,090
I'm trying to grab this.

4386
02:29:10,530 --> 02:29:11,250
Oh no, no, please.

4387
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:15,490
Reload.

4388
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:17,770
How are you walking with no head?

4389
02:29:35,010 --> 02:29:36,550
Nice, that was pretty cool.

4390
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:41,940
No, mine too.

4391
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:46,860
They don't have to expose us at the end too.

4392
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:47,800
You are...

4393
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:48,600
You are on...

4394
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:48,980
You are on...

4395
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:49,580
You are on controller though.

4396
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:50,520
I have no excuse.

4397
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,940
You're getting along the line, trust me now.

4398
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:55,140
Hope is in for, yours is worth it.

4399
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:56,140
It is.

4400
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,800
I stake my life on it.

4401
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:02,020
And my life too.

4402
02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:03,560
Yeah, right?

4403
02:30:04,780 --> 02:30:05,220
Oh,

4404
02:30:10,990 --> 02:30:11,850
are we supposed to go inside?

4405
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:12,230
Oh!

4406
02:30:12,330 --> 02:30:12,690
Okay!

4407
02:30:14,230 --> 02:30:14,790
Hey!

4408
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,220
Let us see you!

4409
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:24,900
Are we in the pot now?

4410
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:25,580
Ooh!

4411
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:31,240
You did, you did that.

4412
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:38,200
Oh, there's a lot of people here.

4413
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:38,760
Oh, there's survivors!

4414
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:40,520
Sorry guys.

4415
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:43,200
We're not rescue workers.

4416
02:30:47,970 --> 02:30:50,830
We're just a normal dude and lady.

4417
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:54,930
You see that guy with the big gun with no shoes on?

4418
02:30:55,690 --> 02:30:57,470
I didn't see he had no shoes.

4419
02:30:58,570 --> 02:31:00,650
He's just casual Friday.

4420
02:31:01,230 --> 02:31:03,370
He's gonna get a splinter like that.

4421
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:04,590
He is.

4422
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:09,250
I'm gonna go find him.

4423
02:31:09,250 --> 02:31:10,910
Hey, Mr. This guy?

4424
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:13,630
Oh, he's got shoes on.

4425
02:31:13,810 --> 02:31:15,250
They just kind of blend in.

4426
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:16,510
You're right.

4427
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:19,110
Dude, just blend in.

4428
02:31:19,550 --> 02:31:20,450
Wait, can I have that?

4429
02:31:20,670 --> 02:31:23,510
Mr. Mr. Can I have that?

4430
02:31:24,650 --> 02:31:26,390
Trade you some shoes for it.

4431
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:32,190
Oh wait, there's a lot to explore in here.

4432
02:31:32,810 --> 02:31:34,410
Yeah, there's herbs.

4433
02:31:37,470 --> 02:31:39,790
Are you smashing their supply crates?

4434
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:51,230
Where are the herbs at?

4435
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:54,050
There was one growing out of the floor.

4436
02:31:54,350 --> 02:31:55,090
Oh, wow.

4437
02:31:56,750 --> 02:31:58,410
Kind of a moldy...

4438
02:31:59,230 --> 02:32:00,370
I feel like Link.

4439
02:32:00,370 --> 02:32:02,270
I'm just destroying all their...

4440
02:32:02,270 --> 02:32:02,630
Yeah.

4441
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:04,210
I just don't trust him.

4442
02:32:04,410 --> 02:32:05,030
Take care of him.

4443
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:06,330
Are you okay, Mr.?

4444
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:08,470
What are you looking a little zombie like right now?

4445
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:09,890
Your movements.

4446
02:32:09,910 --> 02:32:11,430
Don't trust any of them.

4447
02:32:11,490 --> 02:32:12,530
Don't trust any of them.

4448
02:32:12,610 --> 02:32:13,270
Oh, I see a herb.

4449
02:32:16,150 --> 02:32:17,190
Oh no, wait.

4450
02:32:17,910 --> 02:32:18,970
I have to combine?

4451
02:32:22,490 --> 02:32:23,570
I have no space.

4452
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:25,210
You make like a super herb?

4453
02:32:25,630 --> 02:32:27,350
A super herb!

4454
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:28,690
You can.

4455
02:32:28,690 --> 02:32:30,510
Oh, I see.

4456
02:32:30,810 --> 02:32:32,030
Then I put it here.

4457
02:32:32,290 --> 02:32:32,590
No?

4458
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:36,770
I still don't understand the herb combining.

4459
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:37,630
Me neither.

4460
02:32:38,970 --> 02:32:40,930
Why can I not...

4461
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:45,720
Go up and down?

4462
02:32:57,020 --> 02:32:58,300
They're all just yelling.

4463
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:02,200
Did they let you attack people?

4464
02:33:03,560 --> 02:33:04,120
Oh.

4465
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:04,860
Oh.

4466
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:05,280
No.

4467
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:06,260
I don't think so.

4468
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:07,340
I don't.

4469
02:33:07,660 --> 02:33:08,480
Oh, this guy?

4470
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:11,140
Why are you squatting?

4471
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:12,340
Who someone...

4472
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:13,040
Does he deserve it?

4473
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:14,240
Kill him.

4474
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:14,740
Suspicious.

4475
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:18,460
Kill...

4476
02:33:18,460 --> 02:33:19,420
Wow, what is he doing?

4477
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:19,660
Hey.

4478
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:20,540
Hey, mister.

4479
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:22,320
Get up.

4480
02:33:23,140 --> 02:33:24,900
Don't double over in pain.

4481
02:33:27,180 --> 02:33:28,600
Oh my god, he's like dizzy.

4482
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:29,760
Yeah.

4483
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:29,880
Yeah.

4484
02:33:30,080 --> 02:33:31,480
He needs to sit down.

4485
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:31,940
Yeah.

4486
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:34,100
Oh wait, what's this?

4487
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:37,140
Madonna of happiness.

4488
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:37,820
Oh.

4489
02:33:37,820 --> 02:33:40,560
Oh, it's a puzzle.

4490
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:43,480
There's more here than meets the eye.

4491
02:33:43,940 --> 02:33:44,960
Do we move the Madonna?

4492
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:47,840
I don't know.

4493
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:48,520
Where do...

4494
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:49,220
Where does Madonna...

4495
02:33:49,220 --> 02:33:49,720
Oh, there's a...

4496
02:33:49,720 --> 02:33:50,780
Crazy statue.

4497
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,080
Oh, it's gotta...

4498
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,780
It's gotta move outwards.

4499
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:55,360
Shit.

4500
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:56,280
What do we do?

4501
02:33:57,180 --> 02:33:58,500
On these rails.

4502
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:00,820
Let's take a look around.

4503
02:34:01,240 --> 02:34:01,760
Okay.

4504
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:02,760
Maybe there's another Madonna?

4505
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:04,600
Yeah, and then...

4506
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:05,780
What?

4507
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:08,460
Oh, you'll help me out.

4508
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:08,760
Okay.

4509
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:09,740
I'll boost you.

4510
02:34:09,980 --> 02:34:11,040
I noticed that there was...

4511
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:12,260
That the ladder was broken.

4512
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:15,240
Oh, there's like a Madonna spot here.

4513
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:16,520
Oh.

4514
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:16,580
No.

4515
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:18,260
I placed Madonna.

4516
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:18,620
Huh?

4517
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:19,260
Something's happening.

4518
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:21,060
What are we not seeing here?

4519
02:34:21,080 --> 02:34:21,860
Somebody's swearing.

4520
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:22,820
The two...

4521
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:24,400
The two motherly saints will reveal the path.

4522
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:24,840
The two...

4523
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:26,480
The two motherly saints will reveal...

4524
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:27,940
Okay, so we gotta find another lady.

4525
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:29,700
I'm searching.

4526
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:33,880
Dang this...

4527
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:34,900
Hmm?

4528
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:37,160
Do I just stay down here?

4529
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:41,400
Why does he never wanna join me?

4530
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,660
Like you...

4531
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:43,480
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4532
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:44,740
I think I can bring you here.

4533
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:45,700
Hold on.

4534
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:47,320
Oh, can you open a door?

4535
02:34:48,100 --> 02:34:48,700
Come in.

4536
02:34:49,180 --> 02:34:49,700
There you go.

4537
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:50,940
Yeah.

4538
02:34:58,520 --> 02:35:00,140
What are you doing over there?

4539
02:35:00,140 --> 02:35:01,700
I'm destroying things.

4540
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:03,680
Open the chest.

4541
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:04,520
Open the chest.

4542
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:04,780
Open the chest, Mimi.

4543
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:07,120
Is it a mimic?

4544
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,300
It's a lady!

4545
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:12,800
Madonna of Charity.

4546
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:13,860
It's the other Madonna.

4547
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:16,280
It's identical to the other one.

4548
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:18,060
Something tells you...

4549
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:18,780
Just for show.

4550
02:35:19,740 --> 02:35:20,000
What?

4551
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:21,120
Oh, I think you put it here.

4552
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:25,620
Two motherly saints will reveal the path.

4553
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:28,120
Wait.

4554
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:29,400
Oh, do I have it?

4555
02:35:29,400 --> 02:35:30,300
Are you okay?

4556
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:31,920
I don't know.

4557
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:35,320
I don't know what I'm doing.

4558
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:35,760
There's no...

4559
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:37,100
There's no prompt for me.

4560
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:41,300
I'm just gonna stand here.

4561
02:35:41,460 --> 02:35:41,720
There it is.

4562
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:42,960
Wait.

4563
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:45,280
There's no prompt.

4564
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:50,080
Wait, do I go to the other side?

4565
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:50,840
Okay.

4566
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:52,900
I think I go...

4567
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:53,880
I'm like watching you.

4568
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:55,320
My camera's on you.

4569
02:35:57,140 --> 02:35:59,560
It's gonna make me motion sick.

4570
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:02,960
Wait, you're watching me right now?

4571
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,040
Yeah, I am.

4572
02:36:04,460 --> 02:36:06,560
I think a really janky camera.

4573
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:12,170
There.

4574
02:36:13,850 --> 02:36:14,850
Oh, nice.

4575
02:36:15,230 --> 02:36:15,770
Nice!

4576
02:36:17,250 --> 02:36:17,890
Oh.

4577
02:36:19,130 --> 02:36:19,770
Oh.

4578
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:21,770
Don't get squished in there.

4579
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:22,250
It tried.

4580
02:36:24,410 --> 02:36:25,410
It tried.

4581
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,570
There's a little bit of an attempt.

4582
02:36:29,650 --> 02:36:30,170
Let's go.

4583
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:38,440
The catacombs.

4584
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:40,600
There can't be zombies in here.

4585
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:41,220
Elena.

4586
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:42,440
Grab the other one.

4587
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:42,940
Okay.

4588
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:43,240
Oh.

4589
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,420
Are we gonna get separated?

4590
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:47,240
Oh, no.

4591
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:48,020
We are.

4592
02:36:49,380 --> 02:36:52,040
Why do they have this in the church?

4593
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:53,640
They have laser beams!

4594
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:55,920
Wait, it says defeat the statue.

4595
02:36:57,020 --> 02:36:58,100
What does that mean?

4596
02:36:59,240 --> 02:36:59,900
I don't know.

4597
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:00,680
I pushed the button.

4598
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:02,740
Oh.

4599
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:03,640
What?

4600
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:05,300
Uh-oh.

4601
02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:05,760
Oh.

4602
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:06,820
Ouch!

4603
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:09,800
I pressed E instead.

4604
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:13,160
Okay.

4605
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:13,520
Goodbye!

4606
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:14,700
Who built this?

4607
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,880
In the church?

4608
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:18,440
For what reason?

4609
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:21,600
This is aggressive.

4610
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:23,340
Oh, I think there's gonna be more.

4611
02:37:23,560 --> 02:37:24,960
This is gonna get a little bit dicey.

4612
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:25,520
Uh-oh.

4613
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:28,620
And there's fire now even!

4614
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:30,200
The theatrics.

4615
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:33,960
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4616
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:35,380
No, no, no, no, no.

4617
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:38,140
It's like a whack-a-mole.

4618
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,300
It's the craziest game of whack-a-mole ever.

4619
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:44,220
Oh, my gosh.

4620
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:44,860
Oh, my gosh.

4621
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:44,900
Oh, my gosh.

4622
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:45,520
No, no, no, no.

4623
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:45,700
Please!

4624
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:46,700
This is gonna stop me.

4625
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:48,040
Just keep moving.

4626
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:50,420
Zig-zagging.

4627
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:51,280
I'm serpentine.

4628
02:37:53,380 --> 02:37:54,060
Oh, my God!

4629
02:37:55,480 --> 02:37:56,040
Whack-a-mole!

4630
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:56,640
Whack-a-mole!

4631
02:37:58,380 --> 02:37:59,340
Are you popping up?

4632
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:02,100
I hear you.

4633
02:38:02,380 --> 02:38:02,480
I hear you.

4634
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:03,420
Nope, that's your side.

4635
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:06,340
Oh, my gosh!

4636
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:06,940
There's two of them!

4637
02:38:07,500 --> 02:38:07,980
Two of them!

4638
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:08,460
Ouch!

4639
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:10,980
Oh, my God!

4640
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:11,980
They're comboing me!

4641
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:13,180
Oh, my God!

4642
02:38:13,240 --> 02:38:13,520
Me too!

4643
02:38:13,640 --> 02:38:13,960
Me too!

4644
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:15,540
No, no!

4645
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:17,000
Why are there three of them?

4646
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:18,380
Oh, my gosh.

4647
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:19,240
This is getting crazy.

4648
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:20,200
Serpentine.

4649
02:38:27,410 --> 02:38:28,690
That has to be it, right?

4650
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:30,350
There can't be four of them.

4651
02:38:30,510 --> 02:38:30,770
Oh, no.

4652
02:38:30,810 --> 02:38:31,170
There's more.

4653
02:38:31,850 --> 02:38:32,470
Oh, my gosh.

4654
02:38:32,670 --> 02:38:34,150
Please, please, please, please, please.

4655
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:41,610
Oh, there's way too many!

4656
02:38:41,970 --> 02:38:42,810
Oh, my gosh.

4657
02:38:43,570 --> 02:38:44,050
Oh, my gosh!

4658
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:49,690
Oh, my gosh.

4659
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:54,190
The tic-tac?

4660
02:38:54,370 --> 02:38:55,570
Is this like a...

4661
02:38:55,570 --> 02:38:56,650
cool church activity every...

4662
02:38:56,650 --> 02:38:57,150
Oh, we did it!

4663
02:38:57,210 --> 02:38:57,450
We did it!

4664
02:38:57,450 --> 02:38:57,970
Let's go.

4665
02:38:58,230 --> 02:39:00,310
I know, this is what they're doing, like the youth group.

4666
02:39:01,570 --> 02:39:02,590
What is this?

4667
02:39:02,810 --> 02:39:04,410
If I cross this, will I die?

4668
02:39:04,410 --> 02:39:04,510
What?

4669
02:39:05,130 --> 02:39:09,390
Oh, the... the previous guests have perished in the trials.

4670
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:12,610
The Outlast trials.

4671
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:17,880
Okay.

4672
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:21,360
Were they grave robbing?

4673
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:21,820
What is this?

4674
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:22,200
Can you pick up the laser?

4675
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:24,100
I think this is the laser from his gun.

4676
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:25,100
I want that gun.

4677
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:27,000
What?

4678
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:28,800
Did it hurt you?

4679
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:29,720
No.

4680
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:33,420
Can you pick it up?

4681
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,860
It doesn't let me do anything.

4682
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:36,960
Oh.

4683
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:40,100
It's another...

4684
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:44,040
It's another puzzle.

4685
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:45,540
I like it.

4686
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:47,860
Wait, if I block it...

4687
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:49,200
Oh, you're blocking it?

4688
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:54,200
Oh, oh, we have lasers too.

4689
02:39:57,420 --> 02:39:59,160
Do you have a statue on your side?

4690
02:39:59,340 --> 02:39:59,600
Yeah.

4691
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:01,100
Oh, that was it.

4692
02:40:01,700 --> 02:40:02,300
Okay.

4693
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,500
Okay.

4694
02:40:06,900 --> 02:40:07,660
Uh-oh.

4695
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:08,680
Goodbye.

4696
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:12,220
There can't be zombies here!

4697
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:12,780
Why?

4698
02:40:16,400 --> 02:40:17,320
Wrong side.

4699
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:20,780
I've got another statue.

4700
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:21,900
Wait, do you have zombies?

4701
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:22,660
Yeah, I have zombies.

4702
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:23,400
You don't have zombies?

4703
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:24,180
No.

4704
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:24,340
No.

4705
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:25,700
I have one zombie.

4706
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:29,220
One single zombie.

4707
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:30,220
Oh, you have a...

4708
02:40:30,220 --> 02:40:31,120
Oh, I have a statue too.

4709
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:31,660
I have a statue.

4710
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:32,400
I got it.

4711
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:34,260
Very good.

4712
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:36,540
We're killing these puzzles.

4713
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:38,180
We are.

4714
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:39,360
It's like portal.

4715
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:41,340
It really is.

4716
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:42,860
Um...

4717
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:43,220
Oh, wait.

4718
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:44,540
Do I get the statue down here?

4719
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:46,660
Wait, space.

4720
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,100
Oh.

4721
02:40:47,560 --> 02:40:48,220
What does that mean?

4722
02:40:48,380 --> 02:40:48,520
No?

4723
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:50,400
I don't think so.

4724
02:40:51,020 --> 02:40:52,120
It's already lit.

4725
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:52,460
I think it's already lit.

4726
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:52,580
Yeah.

4727
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:54,080
Oh, up, up, up.

4728
02:40:54,360 --> 02:40:54,760
Up!

4729
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:57,460
Mamers never look up.

4730
02:40:57,560 --> 02:40:58,280
It's true.

4731
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:00,880
I say that all the time.

4732
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:07,620
It's up again.

4733
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:08,940
It's in like a mirror.

4734
02:41:09,140 --> 02:41:09,600
It's kind of cool.

4735
02:41:09,780 --> 02:41:10,180
Oh, shoot.

4736
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:10,620
Oh.

4737
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:11,600
You okay?

4738
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:12,740
Oh, my God!

4739
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:13,620
We just got one...

4740
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:15,120
One singular zombie.

4741
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:16,420
It's all...

4742
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:23,680
Oh.

4743
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:24,880
It's a mirror?

4744
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:25,520
Yeah.

4745
02:41:25,800 --> 02:41:26,440
It's neat.

4746
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:27,560
Oh.

4747
02:41:32,820 --> 02:41:33,380
And...

4748
02:41:33,380 --> 02:41:33,780
Oh, whoops.

4749
02:41:33,940 --> 02:41:34,900
That's not what I meant to press.

4750
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:36,020
Oh, my gosh.

4751
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:37,300
Madonna of Sorrow.

4752
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:40,640
Did that just close something?

4753
02:41:41,380 --> 02:41:42,120
Are we in trouble?

4754
02:41:42,200 --> 02:41:42,980
Oh, it opened something.

4755
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:45,460
Okay.

4756
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:47,400
Very fancy.

4757
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,440
I'm guessing that's how we leave after.

4758
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:50,860
Yeah.

4759
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:53,900
There were two more spots for statues, right?

4760
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:55,900
Oh.

4761
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:57,160
Wait.

4762
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:58,380
I can't get this.

4763
02:41:58,480 --> 02:41:58,760
I'm full.

4764
02:41:58,760 --> 02:41:59,680
I can't get this ammo.

4765
02:41:59,800 --> 02:42:01,080
Because we don't have the gun.

4766
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:01,840
Here it is.

4767
02:42:02,120 --> 02:42:02,500
Oh.

4768
02:42:03,380 --> 02:42:05,560
We got the sniper rifle!

4769
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:06,500
Sniper!

4770
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:09,260
Oh, and there's another statue.

4771
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,680
Oh, but I think I'm actually full of this.

4772
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:13,200
I can't actually take it.

4773
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:14,580
Oh, shoot.

4774
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:15,840
I put down a bomb.

4775
02:42:17,420 --> 02:42:18,500
By your feet.

4776
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:19,040
That's okay.

4777
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:20,500
Watch out.

4778
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:26,020
Like, sniper.

4779
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:30,300
Me too.

4780
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:32,040
Um...

4781
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:33,900
Are you gonna blow that up, or...?

4782
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:36,460
I'll just leave.

4783
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:37,340
Okay.

4784
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:40,680
Don't worry about it.

4785
02:42:41,540 --> 02:42:42,060
Ominously...

4786
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:42,940
Beeping.

4787
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:43,480
Beeping.

4788
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:45,980
Just don't accidentally press anything.

4789
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:46,480
Oh!

4790
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:47,180
Oh, it...

4791
02:42:47,180 --> 02:42:47,680
Oh, no.

4792
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:48,360
It didn't explode.

4793
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:49,320
That was just lightning.

4794
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:52,580
Oh, wait.

4795
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:54,980
I only have a little bit of ammo for this.

4796
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:56,080
Yeah.

4797
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:57,420
Wait.

4798
02:42:57,460 --> 02:42:58,600
Do we have to snipe something?

4799
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:00,480
Maybe...

4800
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:01,060
Oh, like the...

4801
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:01,840
The statue.

4802
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:03,360
The bell?

4803
02:43:03,360 --> 02:43:03,920
The bell?

4804
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:04,820
Where do you see the bell?

4805
02:43:04,820 --> 02:43:05,020
I don't know.

4806
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:05,380
Oh, wait.

4807
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:10,060
Toll the five bells loud and clear, and thus the true path shall appear.

4808
02:43:12,420 --> 02:43:14,080
Do we have to use the sniper?

4809
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:15,540
I guess so.

4810
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:16,760
I'm...

4811
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:17,280
I'm cheap.

4812
02:43:18,220 --> 02:43:18,960
I know, right?

4813
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:20,320
Oh, you don't need to use the sniper.

4814
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:24,960
I...

4815
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:25,720
That's three?

4816
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:26,300
Four?

4817
02:43:26,500 --> 02:43:27,300
How many do we have?

4818
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:29,700
I don't know.

4819
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:30,360
Okay.

4820
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:32,720
Wait, this is not gonna attract the zombies.

4821
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:36,560
Is there a tiny one in there?

4822
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:38,360
I think...

4823
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:39,560
So...

4824
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:41,260
I think I got it, maybe?

4825
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:42,880
I believe.

4826
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:47,020
Two more?

4827
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,320
Oh, oh my goodness.

4828
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:50,700
Oh, is that a bell?

4829
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:51,540
Getting laggy.

4830
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:52,100
Whoa.

4831
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:53,040
No.

4832
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:54,860
Oh, there's one there.

4833
02:43:56,980 --> 02:43:57,680
That's all.

4834
02:43:57,680 --> 02:43:58,660
Oh, nice.

4835
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:00,540
I feel bad shooting your cheeks.

4836
02:44:02,060 --> 02:44:03,740
Bring all five bells.

4837
02:44:04,440 --> 02:44:07,600
Classic video game puzzles that don't make any sense.

4838
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:08,200
I don't.

4839
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:10,720
In the context of the world.

4840
02:44:12,640 --> 02:44:13,840
I just...

4841
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:14,880
Yeah.

4842
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:16,340
You just do it.

4843
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:17,840
Search the cathedral.

4844
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:18,140
Yeah, just do it.

4845
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:21,540
Well, that door that I said would open up.

4846
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:22,460
Opened up.

4847
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:24,600
Shortcut.

4848
02:44:24,600 --> 02:44:24,920
Did you hear that?

4849
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,300
I hope it was a door.

4850
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:29,200
The bomb is still beeping.

4851
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:29,780
Come on.

4852
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:30,160
Nice.

4853
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:31,680
We'll just leave that there.

4854
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:33,840
Is everybody okay down there?

4855
02:44:34,100 --> 02:44:34,940
No, we're actually okay.

4856
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:37,580
Boom.

4857
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,000
I think we just killed everybody.

4858
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:39,880
I'm not gonna lie.

4859
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:41,420
Because we just like...

4860
02:44:41,420 --> 02:44:41,500
Why?

4861
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:42,440
Oh, because of the bells.

4862
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:43,280
Yeah.

4863
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:47,880
That might be true.

4864
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:51,620
Like all the zombies are gonna come in full force now.

4865
02:44:51,900 --> 02:44:51,980
What?

4866
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:52,900
Oh, I'm pressing V?

4867
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:54,440
Yeah.

4868
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:57,520
Oh, so in sync.

4869
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:58,100
I know.

4870
02:44:59,620 --> 02:45:00,160
Teamwork.

4871
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:04,340
That's more like it.

4872
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:04,820
Woohoo!

4873
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:08,180
Oh, the zombies are all gonna come in flood and mass.

4874
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:11,360
Maybe we can hide in there.

4875
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:16,180
Oh, you're right.

4876
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:17,020
There they are.

4877
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:18,140
Ew.

4878
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:19,120
It's wet.

4879
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:23,220
Nothing good ever happens in these games.

4880
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:24,580
No.

4881
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:25,020
Oh!

4882
02:45:28,380 --> 02:45:28,980
Ew.

4883
02:45:29,460 --> 02:45:31,120
It's a juicy one.

4884
02:45:34,980 --> 02:45:35,960
Oh my god!

4885
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:40,240
We really just put all these...

4886
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:42,760
We just sealed these people in their tombs.

4887
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:44,280
We did.

4888
02:45:45,860 --> 02:45:46,940
Don't touch them!

4889
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:49,140
Uh-oh.

4890
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:50,180
Oh!

4891
02:45:55,380 --> 02:45:57,580
Wait, why don't we stay up there where it's safe?

4892
02:45:58,960 --> 02:45:59,520
Okay.

4893
02:46:00,180 --> 02:46:00,980
That's fine.

4894
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:02,120
Oh, gosh.

4895
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:02,760
I gotta reload.

4896
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:03,380
I'm fast!

4897
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:06,000
Ew!

4898
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:07,220
It's laying on steam!

4899
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:08,300
Ew!

4900
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:08,900
Ew!

4901
02:46:09,180 --> 02:46:10,240
Oh my god, I'm down!

4902
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:10,500
I'm down!

4903
02:46:10,780 --> 02:46:11,500
Are you okay?

4904
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:13,840
Oh my god.

4905
02:46:14,200 --> 02:46:14,560
You're down?

4906
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:15,460
I'm in trouble.

4907
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:16,160
Okay, I'm coming.

4908
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:16,500
I'm coming.

4909
02:46:17,580 --> 02:46:18,420
Don't die at me!

4910
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:18,880
Oh!

4911
02:46:19,060 --> 02:46:19,180
No!

4912
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:20,780
We

4913
02:46:24,550 --> 02:46:25,750
start right there, right?

4914
02:46:26,610 --> 02:46:27,590
Yeah, we should...

4915
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:27,870
Yeah, yeah.

4916
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:32,550
Oh my god, it's craziness!

4917
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:35,290
Oh, there's actual zombies too!

4918
02:46:35,570 --> 02:46:35,890
I forgot.

4919
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:37,170
There are.

4920
02:46:37,810 --> 02:46:38,290
Watch out!

4921
02:46:38,310 --> 02:46:39,710
Where's that thing come from?

4922
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:43,430
Not the gas!

4923
02:46:43,810 --> 02:46:44,490
Not the gas!

4924
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:47,830
Does the gas spill the whole room?

4925
02:46:47,970 --> 02:46:48,890
I did the same thing.

4926
02:46:51,530 --> 02:46:52,950
Oh, he's just running around.

4927
02:46:53,090 --> 02:46:53,870
Oh, he's climbing!

4928
02:46:54,430 --> 02:46:55,290
Oh my god!

4929
02:46:56,530 --> 02:46:57,430
Oh my god!

4930
02:46:58,770 --> 02:46:58,970
Oh!

4931
02:46:58,970 --> 02:46:59,610
Oh my...

4932
02:46:59,610 --> 02:47:00,590
Where are you going?

4933
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:04,750
Where are you going, mister?

4934
02:47:06,510 --> 02:47:07,890
Oh, I can't get back up.

4935
02:47:08,430 --> 02:47:08,590
Ah!

4936
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:11,770
When did you get turned, lady?

4937
02:47:13,090 --> 02:47:14,230
Don't panic, people!

4938
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:15,550
Move away from it!

4939
02:47:15,890 --> 02:47:17,390
They're moving forward, then.

4940
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:17,910
Everyone, out of the way!

4941
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:18,510
They're so...

4942
02:47:18,510 --> 02:47:19,510
They're...

4943
02:47:19,510 --> 02:47:20,970
They're kinda stupid, I think.

4944
02:47:21,290 --> 02:47:21,930
Aw, man.

4945
02:47:22,450 --> 02:47:23,790
Are you okay over there?

4946
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:26,390
Oh yeah, I'm just fighting...

4947
02:47:27,210 --> 02:47:28,250
Regular zombies.

4948
02:47:28,570 --> 02:47:29,230
I'm helping.

4949
02:47:30,730 --> 02:47:31,250
I'm...

4950
02:47:31,250 --> 02:47:35,030
Are you sniping?

4951
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:35,450
Yeah.

4952
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:37,130
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

4953
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:41,990
How could you miss?

4954
02:47:42,830 --> 02:47:43,730
Oh my god!

4955
02:47:44,250 --> 02:47:44,750
Oh my god!

4956
02:47:45,030 --> 02:47:47,050
You're busy lining up my shot.

4957
02:47:49,390 --> 02:47:51,050
Suddenly, everybody is a zombie.

4958
02:47:51,050 --> 02:47:51,270
It's a zombie.

4959
02:47:51,410 --> 02:47:52,470
It happened so fast.

4960
02:47:52,490 --> 02:47:53,090
People have died.

4961
02:47:54,050 --> 02:47:54,850
Everyone, run!

4962
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:57,250
There's still one left!

4963
02:47:58,030 --> 02:47:58,630
I know!

4964
02:48:00,370 --> 02:48:00,890
Ah!

4965
02:48:02,660 --> 02:48:03,480
Who's shooting?

4966
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:04,400
Oh my god.

4967
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:06,180
Oh my god!

4968
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:21,300
I can kill you.

4969
02:48:22,100 --> 02:48:25,080
I need to reload, but I don't have very many bullets left.

4970
02:48:26,120 --> 02:48:26,600
Ah!

4971
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:26,980
Oh.

4972
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:30,960
I got five left with my sniper rifle.

4973
02:48:31,860 --> 02:48:32,760
Can I grab...

4974
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:33,860
Did I grab it?

4975
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:34,240
I wonder.

4976
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:35,680
Is it down?

4977
02:48:36,300 --> 02:48:36,980
Oh gosh.

4978
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:37,960
It's doing something.

4979
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:41,680
I'm looting.

4980
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:43,360
It's like...

4981
02:48:43,360 --> 02:48:44,720
But there's no one else to infect!

4982
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:46,500
Everybody's dead!

4983
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:47,540
Everyone died!

4984
02:48:50,200 --> 02:48:51,780
Oh, the herb grew back.

4985
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:55,300
Not so many grenades, but I don't know how to use them yet, you guys.

4986
02:48:56,460 --> 02:48:56,900
There are?

4987
02:48:57,720 --> 02:48:59,820
Yeah, there's like two people over here.

4988
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:00,540
Oh.

4989
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:02,240
Actually, there's a ton of people upstairs.

4990
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:03,520
Where did you guys come from?

4991
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:04,980
Uh-oh.

4992
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:05,940
No!

4993
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:07,660
Ah!

4994
02:49:08,540 --> 02:49:12,510
Eh, why don't we get infected?

4995
02:49:12,530 --> 02:49:13,870
We have such claw armor.

4996
02:49:14,070 --> 02:49:14,730
It's so funny.

4997
02:49:18,670 --> 02:49:19,830
Oh, you guys are safe.

4998
02:49:19,890 --> 02:49:20,690
You're not dead yet.

4999
02:49:21,250 --> 02:49:21,690
Oh.

5000
02:49:23,430 --> 02:49:23,870
Okay.

5001
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:25,090
I'll protect you all.

5002
02:49:25,270 --> 02:49:25,430
Ah!

5003
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:30,030
Oh god!

5004
02:49:30,170 --> 02:49:30,890
It's coming towards me!

5005
02:49:34,210 --> 02:49:35,750
Oh, why did I need to reload?

5006
02:49:35,990 --> 02:49:36,330
Oh, he's climbing!

5007
02:49:37,670 --> 02:49:38,830
The worst time.

5008
02:49:40,590 --> 02:49:41,790
I'm on the ground.

5009
02:49:43,010 --> 02:49:44,310
For some reason.

5010
02:49:45,730 --> 02:49:46,130
Come on.

5011
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:51,560
He's gonna kill the people!

5012
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:56,710
I can't get off the ground.

5013
02:49:57,750 --> 02:49:58,190
Stop!

5014
02:50:06,070 --> 02:50:07,550
Nevermind, I didn't kill it.

5015
02:50:10,270 --> 02:50:12,730
It's like going a little insano mode right now.

5016
02:50:13,810 --> 02:50:14,170
Uh-oh.

5017
02:50:14,890 --> 02:50:15,450
Ah!

5018
02:50:15,630 --> 02:50:15,990
Got him!

5019
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:20,550
He's coming down.

5020
02:50:20,990 --> 02:50:21,550
Again.

5021
02:50:30,460 --> 02:50:31,840
Oh, not towards me.

5022
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:34,500
He's coming!

5023
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:35,000
He's coming!

5024
02:50:35,720 --> 02:50:36,280
Oh no!

5025
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:37,100
He can't grab anything.

5026
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:37,720
Oh no!

5027
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:39,860
Oh no!

5028
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:40,560
No stinky!

5029
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:41,140
No stinky!

5030
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:41,380
No stinky!

5031
02:50:41,620 --> 02:50:41,800
Oh no!

5032
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:44,780
Yes!

5033
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:45,640
Okay, I lived.

5034
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:47,360
Is there anyone left alive?

5035
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:52,760
I'm just shooting anywhere.

5036
02:51:08,910 --> 02:51:10,070
That's nice.

5037
02:51:11,010 --> 02:51:11,790
To what?

5038
02:51:13,130 --> 02:51:14,110
I don't know.

5039
02:51:14,430 --> 02:51:15,610
Underground key card.

5040
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:18,690
This thing was so gross!

5041
02:51:19,430 --> 02:51:22,150
I wasted all my ammo on it.

5042
02:51:22,150 --> 02:51:22,750
Yeah.

5043
02:51:24,770 --> 02:51:25,970
Wait, okay guys.

5044
02:51:26,190 --> 02:51:28,530
I need to learn how to use the grenades for real.

5045
02:51:28,530 --> 02:51:30,690
So I can pick up some of this ammo!

5046
02:51:31,930 --> 02:51:33,690
How do I use them?

5047
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:37,210
How do you switch your regular weapons?

5048
02:51:37,910 --> 02:51:39,530
It's just the scroll wheel.

5049
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:48,480
I just...

5050
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:50,000
Do your other scroll wheel?

5051
02:51:50,200 --> 02:51:50,820
I can't...

5052
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:55,440
Store my herbs?

5053
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:57,460
Can I store more than 10 at a time?

5054
02:51:59,140 --> 02:51:59,860
Oh, whoops.

5055
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:02,700
Oh, I can!

5056
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:04,040
Okay, that works.

5057
02:52:04,040 --> 02:52:04,740
Okay.

5058
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:08,000
I have so many grenades.

5059
02:52:08,340 --> 02:52:09,860
I have like 14 grenades.

5060
02:52:11,720 --> 02:52:13,740
Well, I could just throw them away.

5061
02:52:14,580 --> 02:52:15,180
Yeah.

5062
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:19,080
I don't think it's arrow key.

5063
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:21,040
Because that makes me move.

5064
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:22,800
Like that.

5065
02:52:23,300 --> 02:52:23,800
Shift scroll?

5066
02:52:24,740 --> 02:52:25,880
Thank you!

5067
02:52:27,020 --> 02:52:28,780
Wait, so if I throw it...

5068
02:52:28,780 --> 02:52:29,760
Wait, how do I throw it?

5069
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:31,780
I don't know.

5070
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:33,940
Wait, okay, then I...

5071
02:52:33,940 --> 02:52:34,460
There we go.

5072
02:52:34,720 --> 02:52:35,960
Alright, I learned how to use it.

5073
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:37,460
Oh, nice!

5074
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:38,360
I learned!

5075
02:52:39,880 --> 02:52:41,780
Nothing can stop us now.

5076
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:43,980
Nothing can stop us now.

5077
02:52:48,540 --> 02:52:49,780
I'm gonna make it happen.

5078
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:53,700
Are you ready?

5079
02:52:54,100 --> 02:52:54,540
Yep.

5080
02:52:59,030 --> 02:53:00,130
Let's go, baby!

5081
02:53:00,510 --> 02:53:02,070
I don't know why this guy had the key card.

5082
02:53:02,530 --> 02:53:02,850
I know.

5083
02:53:03,890 --> 02:53:04,950
Ready for what?

5084
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:05,070
What?

5085
02:53:05,450 --> 02:53:06,270
You got this?

5086
02:53:06,490 --> 02:53:07,170
Another boss fight?

5087
02:53:09,870 --> 02:53:10,350
Money!

5088
02:53:11,270 --> 02:53:12,470
Money, money, baby!

5089
02:53:16,910 --> 02:53:18,550
Did you get the king piece?

5090
02:53:19,010 --> 02:53:19,910
The king piece?

5091
02:53:20,490 --> 02:53:21,250
Right here?

5092
02:53:21,570 --> 02:53:22,670
I think you got it.

5093
02:53:23,070 --> 02:53:23,810
So I don't...

5094
02:53:24,450 --> 02:53:25,370
I got skill points.

5095
02:53:25,370 --> 02:53:25,490
Do we share?

5096
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:27,330
You have it.

5097
02:53:27,430 --> 02:53:28,310
I think, right?

5098
02:53:28,410 --> 02:53:28,890
Do we share?

5099
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:36,080
We share?

5100
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:37,660
I'm gonna have my grenades out.

5101
02:53:38,160 --> 02:53:38,860
We do share?

5102
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:40,220
I don't know.

5103
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:41,980
We don't share.

5104
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:44,840
We don't share.

5105
02:53:47,890 --> 02:53:49,430
Skill points are shared.

5106
02:53:49,910 --> 02:53:50,350
I don't...

5107
02:53:50,350 --> 02:53:51,250
Oh, we do share.

5108
02:53:51,430 --> 02:53:51,830
Oh, lag.

5109
02:53:52,170 --> 02:53:52,530
Oh, lag.

5110
02:53:53,170 --> 02:53:53,830
Oh, no.

5111
02:53:55,010 --> 02:53:55,990
Is it a jump scare?

5112
02:53:56,210 --> 02:53:57,070
May or may not fall?

5113
02:53:57,710 --> 02:53:59,250
Are they loading the jump scare in?

5114
02:53:59,770 --> 02:54:00,950
No, there's just a man.

5115
02:54:02,050 --> 02:54:02,950
Just a man.

5116
02:54:03,610 --> 02:54:04,090
Oh!

5117
02:54:04,270 --> 02:54:04,410
Ow!

5118
02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:04,750
Ow!

5119
02:54:04,970 --> 02:54:05,070
Ow!

5120
02:54:05,310 --> 02:54:05,790
Okay!

5121
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:08,310
I don't know who hit me.

5122
02:54:08,430 --> 02:54:10,090
The invisible man is beating me up.

5123
02:54:12,650 --> 02:54:14,190
Not the invisible man.

5124
02:54:16,010 --> 02:54:17,130
Hate that guy.

5125
02:54:17,130 --> 02:54:18,070
No good.

5126
02:54:18,450 --> 02:54:19,310
It's not gonna budge.

5127
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:27,080
Now we're just in jail.

5128
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:28,500
Oh, I see him in there.

5129
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:28,880
Yeah.

5130
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:30,760
Zombie jail.

5131
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:31,320
You see him?

5132
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:31,840
Yeah.

5133
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:33,980
Wait, there's a little hole here.

5134
02:54:34,240 --> 02:54:34,840
Does this work?

5135
02:54:35,480 --> 02:54:35,780
Oops.

5136
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:36,600
That is...

5137
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:38,280
That's not...

5138
02:54:42,890 --> 02:54:44,790
If it's not gonna budge, where do we go?

5139
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:50,530
Maybe if I grenade it.

5140
02:54:50,570 --> 02:54:51,610
Can we go through the grate?

5141
02:54:52,130 --> 02:54:53,690
I believe in grenades now.

5142
02:54:55,030 --> 02:54:55,750
Never mind.

5143
02:54:57,170 --> 02:54:59,650
I think this panel and the numbers in the doors are connected.

5144
02:54:59,930 --> 02:55:00,310
There's a puzzle!

5145
02:55:00,910 --> 02:55:01,290
Ah!

5146
02:55:05,750 --> 02:55:07,150
Uh-oh, you're gonna let him out.

5147
02:55:07,310 --> 02:55:07,430
Oh!

5148
02:55:09,350 --> 02:55:10,530
You're right, I am.

5149
02:55:11,490 --> 02:55:12,670
I was like, go back.

5150
02:55:12,850 --> 02:55:13,150
Go back.

5151
02:55:13,270 --> 02:55:15,070
We need two...

5152
02:55:15,610 --> 02:55:15,870
Something.

5153
02:55:16,830 --> 02:55:17,870
Yeah, what is it?

5154
02:55:20,450 --> 02:55:21,150
Oh, wait.

5155
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:22,130
Huh?

5156
02:55:22,690 --> 02:55:24,430
I can't read it at all.

5157
02:55:25,450 --> 02:55:25,830
It's...

5158
02:55:26,470 --> 02:55:26,850
Wait...

5159
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:27,750
Oh!

5160
02:55:27,830 --> 02:55:28,610
Well, it's either two...

5161
02:55:29,170 --> 02:55:29,750
Two...

5162
02:55:29,750 --> 02:55:30,210
Two...

5163
02:55:30,210 --> 02:55:31,650
Two...

5164
02:55:32,630 --> 02:55:33,390
Uh...

5165
02:55:33,390 --> 02:55:35,330
One zero, probably.

5166
02:55:35,510 --> 02:55:35,690
Yeah.

5167
02:55:36,690 --> 02:55:38,230
Oh, you're a genius.

5168
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:39,230
I gamed!

5169
02:55:39,290 --> 02:55:39,970
I gamed!

5170
02:55:49,910 --> 02:55:51,430
I gamed!

5171
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:51,970
It's not worth it.

5172
02:55:51,970 --> 02:55:51,990
It's not worth it.

5173
02:55:52,110 --> 02:55:53,250
I'm gonna grenade him.

5174
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:55,270
Who?

5175
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:01,040
I believe in grenades now, everybody.

5176
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:05,980
A fifth grader could bust out of here.

5177
02:56:06,580 --> 02:56:08,620
You just have to punch in the numbers in the doors.

5178
02:56:09,100 --> 02:56:10,320
What door do we want?

5179
02:56:10,480 --> 02:56:11,360
Um, we want...

5180
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:12,280
Oh, it's completely...

5181
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:14,640
Blanked out.

5182
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:15,520
We have no idea.

5183
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:17,120
Well, it's not two ten.

5184
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:19,640
And it's not...

5185
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:23,860
It's not one...

5186
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:24,640
I don't know.

5187
02:56:25,060 --> 02:56:27,180
Why are they all scratched out?

5188
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:30,780
What if these would be left?

5189
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:32,040
I think.

5190
02:56:33,420 --> 02:56:34,140
Um...

5191
02:56:34,140 --> 02:56:34,760
Wait...

5192
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:35,540
Zero or two?

5193
02:56:40,520 --> 02:56:41,960
I say...

5194
02:56:42,780 --> 02:56:43,200
Um...

5195
02:56:44,420 --> 02:56:45,400
I know.

5196
02:56:48,940 --> 02:56:50,380
Uh-oh.

5197
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:51,340
Okay.

5198
02:56:51,560 --> 02:56:52,140
I believe you.

5199
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:55,080
Oops!

5200
02:56:55,860 --> 02:56:57,880
There might be a zombie in there.

5201
02:56:58,180 --> 02:56:59,000
Oh, there it is.

5202
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:03,620
Almost had it.

5203
02:57:03,740 --> 02:57:04,660
You had it.

5204
02:57:05,060 --> 02:57:05,780
Wait, he's...

5205
02:57:05,780 --> 02:57:07,420
Who's keeping these lights on?

5206
02:57:08,900 --> 02:57:11,140
That's what I'm wondering about all of this.

5207
02:57:11,720 --> 02:57:13,920
Dang, he's transformed into a crazy zombie.

5208
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:18,860
Why is there a scary, like, torture prison underneath the church?

5209
02:57:24,180 --> 02:57:25,320
Why is there a what?

5210
02:57:26,240 --> 02:57:28,660
Scary torture prison underneath the church?

5211
02:57:28,940 --> 02:57:31,860
I have a sneaking suspicion this is not a church.

5212
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:37,020
What do you want, huh?

5213
02:57:37,780 --> 02:57:38,040
What do you want, huh?

5214
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:39,760
Oh!

5215
02:57:41,140 --> 02:57:41,780
Oh no!

5216
02:57:43,140 --> 02:57:43,580
Oopsie!

5217
02:57:44,120 --> 02:57:46,440
I probably could have guessed it wasn't that one.

5218
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:49,360
Oh, it's this guy.

5219
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:50,800
It has to be...

5220
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:51,720
I killed him.

5221
02:57:52,920 --> 02:57:53,900
You killed him?

5222
02:57:54,040 --> 02:57:54,260
Oh!

5223
02:57:55,140 --> 02:57:56,040
Yeah, we're fine.

5224
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:56,520
We're fine.

5225
02:57:58,740 --> 02:57:59,400
He's dead.

5226
02:57:59,540 --> 02:58:00,000
Good job.

5227
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:00,900
He's done though.

5228
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:05,720
Hey, we're getting to the skill points though.

5229
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:06,920
But it's...

5230
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:07,600
It's zero.

5231
02:58:09,580 --> 02:58:10,520
I believe!

5232
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:11,460
Two, one.

5233
02:58:13,140 --> 02:58:14,460
You did it!

5234
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:15,980
It's open, let's go!

5235
02:58:15,980 --> 02:58:17,980
Brute Force can solve anything!

5236
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:20,480
It's true.

5237
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:24,540
How I do every puzzle.

5238
02:58:24,860 --> 02:58:25,140
How I do every puzzle.

5239
02:58:25,380 --> 02:58:26,000
Biohazard!

5240
02:58:26,260 --> 02:58:27,380
It's the name of the game!

5241
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:28,980
Yeah!

5242
02:58:30,980 --> 02:58:31,600
Oh!

5243
02:58:31,980 --> 02:58:33,380
The interrogation room?

5244
02:58:33,980 --> 02:58:35,480
The torture chamber.

5245
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:36,500
I know!

5246
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:38,460
Why did you bring me here?

5247
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:40,240
Deborah must be close.

5248
02:58:40,460 --> 02:58:40,760
Deborah?

5249
02:58:42,250 --> 02:58:44,780
Who's Deborah and why do you remember the torture chamber?

5250
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:48,640
I have many secrets.

5251
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:50,400
You do!

5252
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:52,020
Please be okay.

5253
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:55,600
Could you share some with the rest of the class?

5254
02:58:55,960 --> 02:58:56,320
Uh-oh.

5255
02:58:56,720 --> 02:58:58,560
Oh, it's not looking so good for Deborah!

5256
02:59:01,420 --> 02:59:02,100
Nice!

5257
02:59:02,920 --> 02:59:03,420
Smash!

5258
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:05,720
I did the mash!

5259
02:59:06,500 --> 02:59:08,540
I did the monster mash!

5260
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:10,520
The monster mash!

5261
02:59:11,280 --> 02:59:13,260
It was a graveyard smash!

5262
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:15,700
Oh!

5263
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:19,220
Kill him!

5264
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:20,500
Kill him!

5265
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:20,720
Yeah!

5266
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:21,900
Dodge!

5267
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:25,780
How did I switch there?

5268
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:27,260
There's like a...

5269
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:29,200
Oh, I can press F as well!

5270
02:59:30,920 --> 02:59:31,580
Okay.

5271
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:33,340
I'm learning the game.

5272
02:59:38,260 --> 02:59:40,160
Is this like a big revelation?

5273
02:59:40,580 --> 02:59:41,740
I don't know!

5274
02:59:41,740 --> 02:59:43,160
The music is so dramatic!

5275
02:59:43,560 --> 02:59:43,820
Yeah, right?

5276
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:48,260
Oh, is this the lab where they invented the...

5277
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:50,260
The virus or something?

5278
02:59:50,940 --> 02:59:52,220
Maybe in this place.

5279
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:55,280
A bag of chips.

5280
02:59:55,960 --> 02:59:56,580
Chips?

5281
02:59:57,020 --> 02:59:58,280
Oh, nice!

5282
02:59:58,280 --> 02:59:59,480
They got some chips.

5283
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:01,180
They're snacking down here.

5284
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:01,800
And some french fries.

5285
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:02,720
Ooh.

5286
03:00:03,460 --> 03:00:05,620
A PNG of french fries.

5287
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:08,840
I don't think it's very good down here.

5288
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:09,380
I don't think...

5289
03:00:09,380 --> 03:00:09,880
I don't think...

5290
03:00:09,880 --> 03:00:11,240
Debra made it.

5291
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:15,860
That's cool.

5292
03:00:16,220 --> 03:00:16,980
That's so cool.

5293
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:17,400
I know!

5294
03:00:18,500 --> 03:00:20,240
Debra, if you're here, give me a sign!

5295
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:21,200
Oh, I found the urinals!

5296
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:22,460
Oh no!

5297
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:24,280
Oh!

5298
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:25,860
God, I'm drawn.

5299
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:26,380
Oh!

5300
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:27,220
Oh my god!

5301
03:00:33,540 --> 03:00:34,020
Oops.

5302
03:00:34,280 --> 03:00:35,000
I forgot to reload.

5303
03:00:36,140 --> 03:00:37,120
Kill that guy.

5304
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:38,640
Nice.

5305
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:39,440
I'm kicking him.

5306
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:40,620
Kick his butt.

5307
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:41,680
Kick his butt.

5308
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:47,180
Oh, I keep...

5309
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:47,680
Wait, R.

5310
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:49,060
I keep pressing F on R or something.

5311
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:52,960
Oh, that's us in the mirror!

5312
03:00:53,100 --> 03:00:53,780
Look at us!

5313
03:00:55,100 --> 03:00:55,820
Oh yeah!

5314
03:00:58,320 --> 03:01:00,140
Oh my gosh, you're a genius!

5315
03:01:08,360 --> 03:01:09,440
Oh, reload?

5316
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:10,660
Yay!

5317
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:12,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

5318
03:01:16,700 --> 03:01:19,120
What's with the panels, thanks to the urinals?

5319
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:21,780
I don't really know much about urinals, to be honest.

5320
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:23,180
Is this a standard feature?

5321
03:01:24,160 --> 03:01:25,100
What's it for?

5322
03:01:25,100 --> 03:01:26,060
It's those...

5323
03:01:26,060 --> 03:01:26,820
It's those...

5324
03:01:26,820 --> 03:01:27,680
Yeah, they...

5325
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:29,220
They probably...

5326
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:30,900
Um...

5327
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:32,040
Read...

5328
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:33,820
And tell you if you're healthy or not.

5329
03:01:33,940 --> 03:01:34,220
Kind of...

5330
03:01:34,220 --> 03:01:35,740
Have you ever heard of those, like...

5331
03:01:35,740 --> 03:01:36,340
Litter boxes?

5332
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:37,100
The kitty litter?

5333
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:38,080
Yeah, the kitty litter!

5334
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:43,440
That must be it.

5335
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:49,800
That's handy.

5336
03:01:50,180 --> 03:01:50,560
Yeah.

5337
03:01:54,320 --> 03:01:54,820
Oh!

5338
03:01:57,820 --> 03:01:58,760
I got you.

5339
03:02:01,780 --> 03:02:03,840
I wish I could crawl through these vents.

5340
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,760
They're like screaming to be crawled through.

5341
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:06,380
They are!

5342
03:02:07,740 --> 03:02:08,120
Uh-oh.

5343
03:02:08,540 --> 03:02:09,200
Is that Debra?

5344
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:12,440
I don't know.

5345
03:02:12,860 --> 03:02:14,020
Does she look like a Debra?

5346
03:02:16,980 --> 03:02:17,480
Dang.

5347
03:02:19,280 --> 03:02:20,020
I will.

5348
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:20,980
It's just...

5349
03:02:20,980 --> 03:02:22,040
We're running out of time.

5350
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:23,200
Please, Leon.

5351
03:02:23,420 --> 03:02:23,800
What do you mean?

5352
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:25,120
We can talk and walk?

5353
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:27,200
I know, right?

5354
03:02:27,480 --> 03:02:28,480
Like, we can...

5355
03:02:29,360 --> 03:02:30,080
What are we?

5356
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:30,780
Savages?

5357
03:02:33,380 --> 03:02:34,260
We can...

5358
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:35,460
Oh.

5359
03:02:46,730 --> 03:02:48,470
I'm the surgeon now.

5360
03:02:50,310 --> 03:02:51,350
It's terminal.

5361
03:02:53,570 --> 03:02:54,090
Um...

5362
03:02:54,090 --> 03:02:55,010
Oh, there's a door here!

5363
03:02:55,150 --> 03:02:55,730
I couldn't see it.

5364
03:02:55,930 --> 03:02:56,290
Whoa!

5365
03:02:59,550 --> 03:03:00,690
Anything else in here?

5366
03:03:01,450 --> 03:03:03,370
Wait, there's another door down here!

5367
03:03:03,370 --> 03:03:04,270
Wait, there...

5368
03:03:04,270 --> 03:03:04,290
Oh.

5369
03:03:04,910 --> 03:03:05,250
Okay, okay.

5370
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:05,930
How do I leave?

5371
03:03:06,230 --> 03:03:07,190
No, it's okay.

5372
03:03:07,370 --> 03:03:07,590
It's okay.

5373
03:03:07,970 --> 03:03:08,850
I think this is a...

5374
03:03:08,850 --> 03:03:10,370
I think we want to explore here too.

5375
03:03:10,690 --> 03:03:11,070
Okay.

5376
03:03:14,670 --> 03:03:15,190
Oh.

5377
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:16,530
That's creepy.

5378
03:03:17,250 --> 03:03:20,370
But the other door was showing as like the...

5379
03:03:21,130 --> 03:03:21,490
Yeah.

5380
03:03:22,050 --> 03:03:22,450
Interesting.

5381
03:03:24,290 --> 03:03:26,170
This is the optional boss fight.

5382
03:03:26,530 --> 03:03:26,830
No!

5383
03:03:27,470 --> 03:03:28,950
What the hell is all this?

5384
03:03:29,470 --> 03:03:31,330
None of these were here three days ago.

5385
03:03:31,850 --> 03:03:32,910
Three days ago?

5386
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:34,090
That's how long it...

5387
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:35,310
Is that for all of this?

5388
03:03:35,410 --> 03:03:35,890
That's it?

5389
03:03:36,110 --> 03:03:36,130
Crazy.

5390
03:03:40,910 --> 03:03:42,550
Be honest with me, Helena.

5391
03:03:42,830 --> 03:03:44,350
Did you invent these zombies?

5392
03:03:44,890 --> 03:03:45,270
Aww.

5393
03:03:45,810 --> 03:03:47,550
That sounds like a Helena thing to do.

5394
03:03:52,170 --> 03:03:53,070
Oh my gosh.

5395
03:03:53,210 --> 03:03:54,850
Birthday tapes are classic.

5396
03:03:55,050 --> 03:03:55,570
To Ada.

5397
03:03:55,650 --> 03:03:56,130
Oh, Ada.

5398
03:03:56,590 --> 03:03:56,830
Yeah.

5399
03:03:59,670 --> 03:04:02,410
These are classic in Resident Evil.

5400
03:04:10,370 --> 03:04:11,270
Is that Ada?

5401
03:04:11,870 --> 03:04:12,830
She's a...

5402
03:04:12,830 --> 03:04:13,370
I don't know.

5403
03:04:13,370 --> 03:04:15,310
She's been turned into the gold labubu.

5404
03:04:16,140 --> 03:04:17,370
Or is this like...

5405
03:04:17,370 --> 03:04:20,420
When your parents record over your childhood...

5406
03:04:21,170 --> 03:04:22,090
The HTS creeps.

5407
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:24,670
With work stuff.

5408
03:04:25,070 --> 03:04:26,130
Then you feel crushed.

5409
03:04:26,290 --> 03:04:26,490
Oh no.

5410
03:04:26,890 --> 03:04:28,090
Oh, we saw this!

5411
03:04:28,090 --> 03:04:28,510
It's...

5412
03:04:28,510 --> 03:04:29,610
She was born!

5413
03:04:30,210 --> 03:04:31,270
Yeah, we did see this!

5414
03:04:31,390 --> 03:04:31,850
That's right!

5415
03:04:32,070 --> 03:04:33,370
Don't look too close.

5416
03:04:35,410 --> 03:04:35,950
Don't...

5417
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:36,890
Don't look too close.

5418
03:04:37,450 --> 03:04:38,950
You can look, everybody.

5419
03:04:41,990 --> 03:04:43,930
Get a feast full.

5420
03:04:46,330 --> 03:04:47,930
Ada's actually an egg?

5421
03:04:49,010 --> 03:04:49,750
Egg-a.

5422
03:04:50,490 --> 03:04:51,390
Is that his girlfriend?

5423
03:04:52,970 --> 03:04:54,430
That was the...

5424
03:04:54,430 --> 03:04:56,190
Didn't we see that ring before?

5425
03:04:57,530 --> 03:04:58,770
Oh, yeah.

5426
03:04:58,910 --> 03:05:01,110
They have been showing us like a big old gold ring.

5427
03:05:01,110 --> 03:05:01,850
Yeah.

5428
03:05:02,170 --> 03:05:03,610
Is this what you wanted to show me?

5429
03:05:04,830 --> 03:05:05,290
No.

5430
03:05:06,970 --> 03:05:07,890
I thought...

5431
03:05:10,470 --> 03:05:10,930
So...

5432
03:05:10,930 --> 03:05:12,770
That's kind of messed up saying happy birthday.

5433
03:05:13,610 --> 03:05:13,890
What?

5434
03:05:13,970 --> 03:05:14,490
It is!

5435
03:05:14,750 --> 03:05:15,190
It is!

5436
03:05:15,510 --> 03:05:16,010
Then we will...

5437
03:05:16,010 --> 03:05:17,990
These will all give birth to Ada?

5438
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:19,170
What the hell did I see?

5439
03:05:19,170 --> 03:05:20,410
Sounds like a win to me.

5440
03:05:20,930 --> 03:05:21,710
Yeah, honestly.

5441
03:05:21,710 --> 03:05:23,890
So that woman or whatever...

5442
03:05:23,890 --> 03:05:24,310
No.

5443
03:05:24,470 --> 03:05:25,630
We should let them live.

5444
03:05:25,850 --> 03:05:26,110
Yeah.

5445
03:05:26,110 --> 03:05:26,250
Yeah.

5446
03:05:27,630 --> 03:05:32,470
I'm the owner of the world's first golden Ada Wong.

5447
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:40,900
Limited edition Ada Labubu.

5448
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:49,160
Time to see...

5449
03:05:49,160 --> 03:05:51,460
What's behind door number 201?

5450
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:53,500
Oh, come on.

5451
03:05:53,940 --> 03:05:54,360
Never mind.

5452
03:05:58,060 --> 03:05:58,960
Really?

5453
03:05:59,320 --> 03:06:00,320
No clues?

5454
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:02,760
Another...

5455
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:04,160
It's gotta be the urinals.

5456
03:06:05,460 --> 03:06:07,220
The panels on the walls.

5457
03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:08,940
We've gotta do this again.

5458
03:06:08,940 --> 03:06:09,520
Oh, oh, wait.

5459
03:06:09,640 --> 03:06:09,820
What...

5460
03:06:09,820 --> 03:06:10,640
What door was it?

5461
03:06:10,760 --> 03:06:11,260
What number?

5462
03:06:11,420 --> 03:06:12,380
Oh, uh, 201.

5463
03:06:13,700 --> 03:06:14,420
What'd you put?

5464
03:06:15,400 --> 03:06:16,420
I put zero.

5465
03:06:23,290 --> 03:06:23,930
Uh-oh.

5466
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:25,470
Wait, is that the one?

5467
03:06:26,450 --> 03:06:27,030
That's her!

5468
03:06:27,030 --> 03:06:28,130
That she was born from?

5469
03:06:28,270 --> 03:06:29,650
Go get your girlfriend, Leon!

5470
03:06:32,830 --> 03:06:33,270
Milady!

5471
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:36,630
Activate the pass...

5472
03:06:36,630 --> 03:06:37,310
Oh, you just...

5473
03:06:42,590 --> 03:06:44,970
Oh, I'm glad to be with her.

5474
03:06:45,110 --> 03:06:45,930
He's feisty.

5475
03:06:46,470 --> 03:06:46,890
He's...

5476
03:06:48,650 --> 03:06:51,050
Oh, there's a bunch of frozen ones down here.

5477
03:06:51,050 --> 03:06:52,710
I'm scared they're gonna come to life.

5478
03:06:53,490 --> 03:06:53,670
Oh.

5479
03:06:54,130 --> 03:06:54,570
Yeah.

5480
03:06:55,190 --> 03:06:56,910
Are they like, cicada shells?

5481
03:06:56,910 --> 03:06:58,730
Like, they're already empty, you know?

5482
03:06:59,050 --> 03:06:59,370
Oh.

5483
03:06:59,370 --> 03:06:59,770
Oh, yes!

5484
03:06:59,950 --> 03:07:01,050
There's a dog in there.

5485
03:07:03,130 --> 03:07:03,630
Oh.

5486
03:07:06,930 --> 03:07:08,250
He sounds angry.

5487
03:07:08,810 --> 03:07:09,030
No.

5488
03:07:09,910 --> 03:07:10,150
Wait.

5489
03:07:11,230 --> 03:07:11,970
There's here?

5490
03:07:15,310 --> 03:07:15,810
Oh.

5491
03:07:16,110 --> 03:07:17,050
I'm in the water.

5492
03:07:17,950 --> 03:07:18,990
Where did you go?

5493
03:07:19,170 --> 03:07:19,890
Oh, did you go down?

5494
03:07:20,090 --> 03:07:20,250
Yeah.

5495
03:07:20,250 --> 03:07:20,330
Yeah.

5496
03:07:22,050 --> 03:07:22,690
Oh.

5497
03:07:23,490 --> 03:07:24,990
I don't know if I like this.

5498
03:07:25,470 --> 03:07:27,150
I feel like this shouldn't be flooded.

5499
03:07:28,310 --> 03:07:29,590
There's nothing...

5500
03:07:29,590 --> 03:07:30,110
here?

5501
03:07:33,570 --> 03:07:34,210
Unless...

5502
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:35,370
Can we crawl in here?

5503
03:07:35,950 --> 03:07:37,710
We should really be able to.

5504
03:07:37,990 --> 03:07:38,310
Right!

5505
03:07:40,010 --> 03:07:41,730
Activate the passageways.

5506
03:07:48,520 --> 03:07:49,520
Oh, there he is!

5507
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:50,900
I feel bad for him.

5508
03:07:50,900 --> 03:07:51,340
Me too!

5509
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:52,620
He's stuck!

5510
03:07:57,750 --> 03:07:58,310
Oh.

5511
03:07:58,450 --> 03:07:59,330
I'm hearing the dog.

5512
03:08:00,870 --> 03:08:01,470
Wait!

5513
03:08:01,690 --> 03:08:02,910
This guy is holding a gun!

5514
03:08:03,970 --> 03:08:05,530
Or he was...

5515
03:08:05,530 --> 03:08:05,830
trying to?

5516
03:08:06,670 --> 03:08:08,130
He's pointing the way.

5517
03:08:08,850 --> 03:08:08,990
Yeah.

5518
03:08:09,970 --> 03:08:11,210
Can we light him up?

5519
03:08:12,350 --> 03:08:13,510
Frankenstein's monster?

5520
03:08:13,770 --> 03:08:14,090
Whoa!

5521
03:08:15,530 --> 03:08:16,130
Okay.

5522
03:08:16,570 --> 03:08:17,550
Oh, no.

5523
03:08:17,690 --> 03:08:18,130
Puzzle.

5524
03:08:19,150 --> 03:08:19,570
Oh!

5525
03:08:20,670 --> 03:08:21,130
Oh!

5526
03:08:21,430 --> 03:08:21,830
I'm...

5527
03:08:21,830 --> 03:08:22,510
I'll pull it!

5528
03:08:22,610 --> 03:08:22,950
Okay!

5529
03:08:27,050 --> 03:08:29,090
We have to activate it one by one.

5530
03:08:29,370 --> 03:08:29,570
Oh.

5531
03:08:29,770 --> 03:08:31,410
Why does everything have to be complicated?

5532
03:08:31,630 --> 03:08:32,210
That's what I'm asking.

5533
03:08:32,210 --> 03:08:33,310
Is the order important?

5534
03:08:34,290 --> 03:08:35,250
Well, how do we...

5535
03:08:35,250 --> 03:08:35,390
Oh.

5536
03:08:37,750 --> 03:08:39,570
How do we even get to the other ones?

5537
03:08:40,270 --> 03:08:41,130
I don't know.

5538
03:08:42,110 --> 03:08:42,570
Whoa...

5539
03:08:42,570 --> 03:08:43,050
Oh!

5540
03:08:43,930 --> 03:08:44,890
Where did you come from?

5541
03:08:45,830 --> 03:08:46,450
I know!

5542
03:08:46,450 --> 03:08:46,730
Oh!

5543
03:08:48,610 --> 03:08:50,650
Just bullying these guys.

5544
03:08:51,690 --> 03:08:52,410
So...

5545
03:08:54,540 --> 03:08:57,440
Oh, these little tippy-taps are so...

5546
03:08:57,440 --> 03:08:58,080
Oh, they're...

5547
03:08:58,080 --> 03:08:58,800
Okay.

5548
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:01,600
Oh, they're coming through the vents!

5549
03:09:06,400 --> 03:09:07,000
You okay?

5550
03:09:07,440 --> 03:09:08,340
I'm okay.

5551
03:09:08,340 --> 03:09:08,420
Okay.

5552
03:09:11,140 --> 03:09:12,040
Come on, Helena.

5553
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:13,380
We gotta activate this thing.

5554
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:13,820
Okay.

5555
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:14,120
Oh.

5556
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:17,100
Are you okay?

5557
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:21,020
Why is he back seating while he's being down by zombies?

5558
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:22,200
Oh my gosh.

5559
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:27,430
Nice.

5560
03:09:32,410 --> 03:09:33,570
He's like on the ground.

5561
03:09:33,730 --> 03:09:34,230
Come on, Helena.

5562
03:09:36,270 --> 03:09:37,250
Oh my gosh.

5563
03:09:37,250 --> 03:09:37,510
Oh my gosh.

5564
03:09:37,830 --> 03:09:38,130
Oh my gosh.

5565
03:09:38,130 --> 03:09:38,650
How did that...

5566
03:09:38,650 --> 03:09:40,290
Wait, they're just like flopping out.

5567
03:09:40,450 --> 03:09:41,010
This is crazy.

5568
03:09:42,790 --> 03:09:43,390
Oh!

5569
03:09:43,450 --> 03:09:43,750
I know!

5570
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:50,980
I have the high ground.

5571
03:09:52,340 --> 03:09:53,240
It's over.

5572
03:09:54,440 --> 03:09:55,380
Oh, come on.

5573
03:09:56,780 --> 03:10:01,380
You gotta activate this thing.

5574
03:10:01,700 --> 03:10:03,060
Now it's you.

5575
03:10:08,530 --> 03:10:09,130
Okay.

5576
03:10:09,470 --> 03:10:11,410
Maybe it's just linear after all.

5577
03:10:12,110 --> 03:10:12,710
Maybe...

5578
03:10:13,250 --> 03:10:14,370
Can we just go?

5579
03:10:14,370 --> 03:10:14,990
Oh my god.

5580
03:10:16,770 --> 03:10:17,330
Nice.

5581
03:10:20,630 --> 03:10:22,510
You guys gotta drop anything.

5582
03:10:22,850 --> 03:10:24,030
Come on, don't be stingy.

5583
03:10:24,670 --> 03:10:24,850
Yeah.

5584
03:10:27,250 --> 03:10:29,530
Give us some runes, precious.

5585
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:36,380
Thank you, Smeagol.

5586
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:37,940
Oh wait, I think we dropped down here.

5587
03:10:39,500 --> 03:10:39,820
Oh, oh.

5588
03:10:45,440 --> 03:10:46,640
Trying to help.

5589
03:10:47,340 --> 03:10:50,570
Got him.

5590
03:10:50,770 --> 03:10:51,170
Nice.

5591
03:10:54,070 --> 03:10:55,050
Oh no!

5592
03:10:58,320 --> 03:10:59,600
Goal shipping it.

5593
03:10:59,900 --> 03:11:00,340
That was awesome.

5594
03:11:00,840 --> 03:11:01,060
Yeah!

5595
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,980
Have you been getting your daily login bonus?

5596
03:11:07,220 --> 03:11:08,100
For goal ship week?

5597
03:11:09,240 --> 03:11:09,980
Yes!

5598
03:11:10,480 --> 03:11:10,660
Yeah!

5599
03:11:11,380 --> 03:11:12,100
Really

5600
03:11:20,950 --> 03:11:21,870
good trainer.

5601
03:11:21,870 --> 03:11:22,030
Yeah.

5602
03:11:26,600 --> 03:11:27,000
Yeah.

5603
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,100
I just really went up.

5604
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:30,620
No, I think we're supposed to go...

5605
03:11:30,620 --> 03:11:31,260
Oh my gosh!

5606
03:11:31,580 --> 03:11:32,220
Oh my god!

5607
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:34,080
Did I do that?

5608
03:11:35,340 --> 03:11:35,740
What's

5609
03:11:47,470 --> 03:11:47,730
happening?

5610
03:11:57,220 --> 03:11:57,960
We're going up?

5611
03:11:58,100 --> 03:11:59,040
We're still moving around.

5612
03:11:59,340 --> 03:12:01,040
Yeah, I think we go up and then we go to...

5613
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:02,720
Yeah, the elevator opened up.

5614
03:12:03,500 --> 03:12:03,980
Okay.

5615
03:12:12,140 --> 03:12:13,080
Oh my god!

5616
03:12:13,540 --> 03:12:13,820
Ow!

5617
03:12:14,080 --> 03:12:15,000
What the...

5618
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:15,800
Did you just die?

5619
03:12:16,180 --> 03:12:17,080
I died!

5620
03:12:17,380 --> 03:12:17,580
No!

5621
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:20,720
Don't make us free to the whole area, please!

5622
03:12:22,180 --> 03:12:22,660
Oh...

5623
03:12:22,660 --> 03:12:23,940
Well, we know what to do now.

5624
03:12:24,040 --> 03:12:24,840
It should be fast.

5625
03:12:26,920 --> 03:12:28,740
What the hell did I just see, Ada?

5626
03:12:29,460 --> 03:12:29,940
No...

5627
03:12:29,940 --> 03:12:30,840
Oh...

5628
03:12:30,840 --> 03:12:31,520
It's okay!

5629
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:34,700
It's now 201.

5630
03:12:35,640 --> 03:12:36,100
No!

5631
03:12:36,240 --> 03:12:37,960
We are all the way back here!

5632
03:12:38,440 --> 03:12:38,920
Yeah...

5633
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:39,400
It's okay.

5634
03:12:40,380 --> 03:12:41,060
This again?

5635
03:12:43,880 --> 03:12:44,840
Oh no...

5636
03:12:45,460 --> 03:12:45,940
Two...

5637
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:47,920
One...

5638
03:12:47,920 --> 03:12:48,500
We know what to do!

5639
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:49,240
We're okay!

5640
03:12:49,660 --> 03:12:50,260
Let's go!

5641
03:12:50,380 --> 03:12:51,420
We'll speedrun it!

5642
03:12:51,540 --> 03:12:52,380
Yeah, we can speedrun.

5643
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:57,260
So just go...

5644
03:12:57,260 --> 03:12:57,860
Um...

5645
03:12:57,860 --> 03:12:58,340
I think it was...

5646
03:12:58,340 --> 03:12:59,700
The first one was...

5647
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:00,620
Wait, what do we...

5648
03:13:00,620 --> 03:13:01,040
Right here?

5649
03:13:01,360 --> 03:13:01,880
Yeah, yeah.

5650
03:13:02,060 --> 03:13:02,860
That one was first.

5651
03:13:03,660 --> 03:13:03,940
Okay.

5652
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,700
And then when you pull it...

5653
03:13:05,700 --> 03:13:07,300
I'll get this one over here.

5654
03:13:07,960 --> 03:13:08,380
Okay.

5655
03:13:10,660 --> 03:13:11,840
Unless it doesn't let you.

5656
03:13:12,140 --> 03:13:13,920
Unless it's like...

5657
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:14,840
Oh, there we go.

5658
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:15,220
Nice!

5659
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:17,840
Oh!

5660
03:13:18,380 --> 03:13:18,740
Oh!

5661
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:19,300
Oh!

5662
03:13:19,300 --> 03:13:20,380
Oh, golly.

5663
03:13:20,640 --> 03:13:20,760
Okay.

5664
03:13:21,100 --> 03:13:21,560
I'm okay.

5665
03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:22,880
Oh my gosh.

5666
03:13:23,120 --> 03:13:23,460
Oh gosh.

5667
03:13:27,660 --> 03:13:29,000
We're killing guys.

5668
03:13:30,020 --> 03:13:30,520
We're okay?

5669
03:13:34,670 --> 03:13:36,090
Oh, she looked at me!

5670
03:13:37,170 --> 03:13:37,810
Ew!

5671
03:13:38,590 --> 03:13:39,750
She like...

5672
03:13:39,750 --> 03:13:41,030
That was so creepy!

5673
03:13:41,810 --> 03:13:42,950
Oh my god!

5674
03:13:44,150 --> 03:13:44,550
Whoa.

5675
03:13:47,930 --> 03:13:48,570
Okay.

5676
03:13:50,780 --> 03:13:52,240
Now we go back down.

5677
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:53,840
Yes.

5678
03:14:05,260 --> 03:14:06,420
Can we swim?

5679
03:14:06,820 --> 03:14:07,480
We swim.

5680
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:11,420
Wait, though.

5681
03:14:11,940 --> 03:14:12,800
Wait, is this right?

5682
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:13,980
Yeah.

5683
03:14:14,400 --> 03:14:15,840
I'm just gonna run for it.

5684
03:14:15,980 --> 03:14:16,280
Yeah, yeah.

5685
03:14:16,380 --> 03:14:16,700
This is right.

5686
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:17,180
This is right.

5687
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:20,140
Just run!

5688
03:14:20,620 --> 03:14:21,060
Go for it.

5689
03:14:21,100 --> 03:14:21,480
Go for it.

5690
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:25,260
I think we're gonna have to come down here again...

5691
03:14:25,260 --> 03:14:25,990
Eventually, but...

5692
03:14:26,780 --> 03:14:27,880
For now, it's...

5693
03:14:27,880 --> 03:14:28,180
Oh!

5694
03:14:32,940 --> 03:14:34,300
You got me!

5695
03:14:34,900 --> 03:14:35,560
Oh my god!

5696
03:14:46,470 --> 03:14:47,630
Oh my gosh.

5697
03:14:47,710 --> 03:14:49,150
Why do I keep pressing F instead?

5698
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:51,250
I have R.

5699
03:14:51,530 --> 03:14:52,970
My fingers are too small.

5700
03:14:53,490 --> 03:14:54,130
Can't reach.

5701
03:14:54,510 --> 03:14:55,210
Can't reach.

5702
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:57,390
You need one of those mini keyboards.

5703
03:15:00,150 --> 03:15:01,050
Are you okay?

5704
03:15:01,210 --> 03:15:01,930
Oh my god!

5705
03:15:01,930 --> 03:15:02,970
Okay.

5706
03:15:03,010 --> 03:15:03,470
Oh!

5707
03:15:05,170 --> 03:15:06,050
Thank you.

5708
03:15:06,750 --> 03:15:06,850
Oh!

5709
03:15:07,170 --> 03:15:08,210
Now it's my turn.

5710
03:15:08,850 --> 03:15:09,490
Wait.

5711
03:15:09,770 --> 03:15:11,070
We just keep getting...

5712
03:15:17,740 --> 03:15:18,700
No ice.

5713
03:15:19,820 --> 03:15:20,200
Okay.

5714
03:15:22,460 --> 03:15:24,380
But we're caught up now, right?

5715
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:25,340
Yeah, we're caught up.

5716
03:15:25,340 --> 03:15:26,700
Oh, actually...

5717
03:15:26,700 --> 03:15:27,680
Where do we go?

5718
03:15:28,060 --> 03:15:28,140
Oh!

5719
03:15:28,420 --> 03:15:29,220
Just to the other side.

5720
03:15:30,840 --> 03:15:31,680
Yeah, I think so.

5721
03:15:31,980 --> 03:15:32,040
Oh.

5722
03:15:32,300 --> 03:15:33,120
I'll give you a boost.

5723
03:15:33,500 --> 03:15:33,560
Oh.

5724
03:15:34,640 --> 03:15:35,280
Wait, am I?

5725
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:36,360
Oh, I am.

5726
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:36,960
Oh!

5727
03:15:37,820 --> 03:15:38,940
Right to a zombie!

5728
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:43,700
Oh, you got the other one?

5729
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:44,900
You gotta activate this thing.

5730
03:15:46,020 --> 03:15:46,420
Oh!

5731
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:47,040
Shoot!

5732
03:15:50,120 --> 03:15:50,780
Oh, ow.

5733
03:15:50,940 --> 03:15:51,560
Trying to get down.

5734
03:15:53,480 --> 03:15:54,640
How did he live?

5735
03:15:58,380 --> 03:15:58,860
Please.

5736
03:16:00,540 --> 03:16:01,020
What?

5737
03:16:04,180 --> 03:16:05,900
Oh, no, no, no!

5738
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,680
No, no, no!

5739
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:06,780
No, no, no!

5740
03:16:07,480 --> 03:16:08,520
You have one too?

5741
03:16:10,120 --> 03:16:11,060
I don't know.

5742
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:12,300
I don't know where he is.

5743
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:13,180
Oh my gosh.

5744
03:16:13,180 --> 03:16:13,400
Ow.

5745
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:14,680
I need a...

5746
03:16:14,680 --> 03:16:15,480
He's on me.

5747
03:16:15,880 --> 03:16:16,780
Did I just start?

5748
03:16:18,440 --> 03:16:21,290
Are you kidding me?

5749
03:16:21,690 --> 03:16:22,670
Oh my gosh.

5750
03:16:22,850 --> 03:16:23,630
Where did you come from?

5751
03:16:26,550 --> 03:16:31,440
Oh my gosh.

5752
03:16:33,400 --> 03:16:34,360
Oh my gosh.

5753
03:16:34,360 --> 03:16:34,460
Oh my gosh.

5754
03:16:34,780 --> 03:16:34,800
What?

5755
03:16:35,080 --> 03:16:35,740
Am I dead?

5756
03:16:35,960 --> 03:16:36,640
Please no.

5757
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:41,000
Oh no.

5758
03:16:41,800 --> 03:16:42,700
Oh no.

5759
03:16:43,660 --> 03:16:46,340
It's on you with all the hard monsters.

5760
03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:48,540
Did we get a save at least?

5761
03:16:48,540 --> 03:16:49,780
I don't know.

5762
03:16:50,800 --> 03:16:51,360
Please.

5763
03:16:51,760 --> 03:16:52,120
Please.

5764
03:16:52,120 --> 03:16:53,140
Please give me kind.

5765
03:16:53,600 --> 03:16:53,660
That wasn't fair.

5766
03:16:54,440 --> 03:16:55,440
I know, right?

5767
03:16:55,440 --> 03:16:56,080
That was crazy.

5768
03:16:57,720 --> 03:16:59,400
What the hell did I just see?

5769
03:16:59,400 --> 03:16:59,780
No.

5770
03:17:00,860 --> 03:17:01,540
No.

5771
03:17:01,540 --> 03:17:02,060
So that woman...

5772
03:17:02,060 --> 03:17:02,640
No.

5773
03:17:03,400 --> 03:17:04,760
It's sadistic.

5774
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:08,520
What was this again?

5775
03:17:08,980 --> 03:17:09,540
What's the...

5776
03:17:09,540 --> 03:17:10,340
What's the room?

5777
03:17:11,680 --> 03:17:12,360
Two...

5778
03:17:12,360 --> 03:17:12,800
One.

5779
03:17:13,340 --> 03:17:14,000
Is this the same?

5780
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:15,700
I guess it would be, yeah.

5781
03:17:17,220 --> 03:17:17,600
Yeah.

5782
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:17,700
Let's go.

5783
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:18,180
Let's go.

5784
03:17:19,440 --> 03:17:20,540
Oh, whoops.

5785
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:22,880
I must be able to get to you...

5786
03:17:23,740 --> 03:17:24,220
There.

5787
03:17:25,740 --> 03:17:26,640
I don't know.

5788
03:17:27,700 --> 03:17:28,940
Maybe you could snipe him.

5789
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:31,820
Yeah, I was trying to snipe him.

5790
03:17:32,480 --> 03:17:33,440
And failing.

5791
03:17:33,860 --> 03:17:34,740
Wait, I'm gonna kill this...

5792
03:17:34,740 --> 03:17:35,580
I'll try harder.

5793
03:17:35,780 --> 03:17:37,320
I'm gonna kill this guy preemptively.

5794
03:17:37,640 --> 03:17:38,080
Wait, can I?

5795
03:17:38,580 --> 03:17:39,400
Can I kill him?

5796
03:17:39,640 --> 03:17:40,500
I don't think so.

5797
03:17:40,960 --> 03:17:41,220
Alright.

5798
03:17:43,540 --> 03:17:46,060
Once you make your move...

5799
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:49,220
Perfect.

5800
03:17:49,480 --> 03:17:50,700
Perfect speed running.

5801
03:17:51,080 --> 03:17:51,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5802
03:17:52,340 --> 03:17:53,560
Okay, maybe he is...

5803
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:54,280
Already dead.

5804
03:17:58,630 --> 03:17:59,490
Speed running.

5805
03:17:59,710 --> 03:18:00,170
Speed running.

5806
03:18:00,950 --> 03:18:02,450
Oh wait, I'm by myself!

5807
03:18:02,710 --> 03:18:03,750
Oh, why did I do that?

5808
03:18:07,430 --> 03:18:07,950
Um...

5809
03:18:08,910 --> 03:18:09,430
Uh...

5810
03:18:09,430 --> 03:18:10,270
We're okay.

5811
03:18:10,790 --> 03:18:11,290
Sorry,

5812
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:19,820
I made a mistake.

5813
03:18:20,620 --> 03:18:21,460
That's okay.

5814
03:18:21,940 --> 03:18:23,100
I didn't...

5815
03:18:29,850 --> 03:18:31,710
Wait, it's actually perfect speed running.

5816
03:18:31,710 --> 03:18:33,130
Yeah, we're actually speed running.

5817
03:18:33,410 --> 03:18:34,230
This is actually great.

5818
03:18:35,610 --> 03:18:37,230
I just run to the other side.

5819
03:18:39,410 --> 03:18:40,310
We juke him?

5820
03:18:40,430 --> 03:18:40,890
We juke him?

5821
03:18:41,610 --> 03:18:42,410
We juke him?

5822
03:18:42,670 --> 03:18:43,230
We juke him?

5823
03:18:43,330 --> 03:18:43,450
We juke him?

5824
03:18:43,450 --> 03:18:43,590
We juke him?

5825
03:18:43,730 --> 03:18:44,370
We juke him?

5826
03:18:46,470 --> 03:18:46,870
Uh oh.

5827
03:18:50,030 --> 03:18:50,550
Nice.

5828
03:18:56,700 --> 03:18:57,220
Okay.

5829
03:18:59,560 --> 03:19:00,500
Tippy toppy dog.

5830
03:19:01,280 --> 03:19:01,720
Oh goodness.

5831
03:19:01,720 --> 03:19:02,040
It's...

5832
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,220
It's never ending.

5833
03:19:06,560 --> 03:19:06,820
I know.

5834
03:19:07,820 --> 03:19:11,340
Oh gosh, I'm out of...

5835
03:19:12,440 --> 03:19:13,500
Hide the bat!

5836
03:19:17,410 --> 03:19:17,870
That was good.

5837
03:19:17,970 --> 03:19:18,950
That was fast.

5838
03:19:19,090 --> 03:19:19,530
For now.

5839
03:19:21,810 --> 03:19:22,230
Ooh.

5840
03:19:22,670 --> 03:19:23,270
Skill point.

5841
03:19:23,630 --> 03:19:24,590
And now...

5842
03:19:25,150 --> 03:19:26,570
Comes the scary part.

5843
03:19:29,150 --> 03:19:30,450
I know, I'm scared.

5844
03:19:31,310 --> 03:19:32,390
I'm scared for real.

5845
03:19:32,590 --> 03:19:33,230
Wait, what was that?

5846
03:19:33,370 --> 03:19:34,230
Oh my gosh.

5847
03:19:34,650 --> 03:19:35,570
That's just me.

5848
03:19:37,650 --> 03:19:38,790
Okay, come over here.

5849
03:19:38,990 --> 03:19:39,250
Okay.

5850
03:19:41,970 --> 03:19:42,670
Okay, wait.

5851
03:19:42,750 --> 03:19:43,950
Let me prepare my weapon.

5852
03:19:44,250 --> 03:19:44,470
Okay.

5853
03:19:46,350 --> 03:19:46,870
Um...

5854
03:19:46,870 --> 03:19:47,750
Uh...

5855
03:19:47,750 --> 03:19:48,050
Oh.

5856
03:19:48,570 --> 03:19:48,890
Ah!

5857
03:19:49,550 --> 03:19:50,070
Whoa!

5858
03:19:50,210 --> 03:19:50,850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5859
03:19:52,550 --> 03:19:53,550
Oh my god!

5860
03:19:57,790 --> 03:19:58,310
Nice!

5861
03:19:58,610 --> 03:19:59,370
What's happening?

5862
03:19:59,690 --> 03:20:00,810
Okay, we got them.

5863
03:20:02,990 --> 03:20:04,790
Wait, I did not prepare my weapon.

5864
03:20:04,790 --> 03:20:05,150
Oh.

5865
03:20:08,270 --> 03:20:09,230
Shut up, lady.

5866
03:20:09,570 --> 03:20:09,870
Shut up.

5867
03:20:10,090 --> 03:20:11,010
Shut up, lady.

5868
03:20:11,310 --> 03:20:11,750
Shut up.

5869
03:20:13,010 --> 03:20:13,550
Okay.

5870
03:20:13,850 --> 03:20:14,390
Not sniper.

5871
03:20:14,770 --> 03:20:15,030
Oh my gosh!

5872
03:20:15,490 --> 03:20:17,030
I wish I could use this.

5873
03:20:17,590 --> 03:20:18,130
Okay.

5874
03:20:22,050 --> 03:20:23,350
Maybe I use this.

5875
03:20:25,510 --> 03:20:26,050
Okay.

5876
03:20:28,350 --> 03:20:28,890
Um...

5877
03:20:28,890 --> 03:20:29,370
Are you okay?

5878
03:20:30,110 --> 03:20:30,650
Yes.

5879
03:20:31,290 --> 03:20:31,850
Hurry, Leon.

5880
03:20:32,010 --> 03:20:33,010
You gotta activate this thing.

5881
03:20:33,010 --> 03:20:33,330
Uh...

5882
03:20:33,330 --> 03:20:34,570
I'm the one taking the long time.

5883
03:20:34,770 --> 03:20:34,890
Okay.

5884
03:20:35,090 --> 03:20:35,450
It's me.

5885
03:20:35,690 --> 03:20:36,270
It's not you.

5886
03:20:36,370 --> 03:20:36,630
It's me.

5887
03:20:36,910 --> 03:20:37,170
Wait.

5888
03:20:37,330 --> 03:20:37,510
No.

5889
03:20:37,790 --> 03:20:39,230
Am I gonna...

5890
03:20:39,710 --> 03:20:40,110
Help!

5891
03:20:40,930 --> 03:20:41,990
Can I tow it to you?

5892
03:20:45,560 --> 03:20:46,720
I'm just unloading on him.

5893
03:20:47,620 --> 03:20:48,760
I'm unloading on him.

5894
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:03,550
I did it!

5895
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:04,350
Yeah!

5896
03:21:06,490 --> 03:21:07,270
From the other side.

5897
03:21:09,590 --> 03:21:10,230
Oh.

5898
03:21:10,230 --> 03:21:10,550
Oh.

5899
03:21:10,550 --> 03:21:10,710
There's...

5900
03:21:10,710 --> 03:21:11,990
There's nothing behind me.

5901
03:21:12,050 --> 03:21:12,770
There's so many.

5902
03:21:13,210 --> 03:21:13,430
Oh!

5903
03:21:14,110 --> 03:21:14,710
Ah!

5904
03:21:16,330 --> 03:21:17,390
Oh my gosh.

5905
03:21:17,590 --> 03:21:17,830
Please.

5906
03:21:18,370 --> 03:21:18,710
Oh!

5907
03:21:22,820 --> 03:21:23,720
I'm running.

5908
03:21:25,320 --> 03:21:26,380
I'm scared.

5909
03:21:26,960 --> 03:21:27,820
Don't be scared.

5910
03:21:29,400 --> 03:21:30,340
Oh my gosh.

5911
03:21:30,400 --> 03:21:31,120
I'm gonna throw a grenade.

5912
03:21:31,560 --> 03:21:31,900
No!

5913
03:21:31,900 --> 03:21:31,940
No!

5914
03:21:32,360 --> 03:21:32,800
Yeah!

5915
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:33,440
Nice!

5916
03:21:37,260 --> 03:21:37,900
Hit it!

5917
03:21:38,200 --> 03:21:38,480
Oh!

5918
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:39,080
Uh...

5919
03:21:39,080 --> 03:21:40,400
Are you gonna die yet, lady?

5920
03:21:41,080 --> 03:21:41,520
Or...

5921
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:41,860
Wait.

5922
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:43,140
I kinda want your stuff though!

5923
03:21:44,020 --> 03:21:44,220
Oh!

5924
03:21:46,420 --> 03:21:46,860
Oh!

5925
03:21:48,860 --> 03:21:48,880
Oh!

5926
03:21:48,880 --> 03:21:49,160
Oh!

5927
03:21:49,580 --> 03:21:49,980
Wait.

5928
03:21:50,140 --> 03:21:50,820
How do I get outta here?

5929
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:52,820
How do I...

5930
03:21:52,820 --> 03:21:53,420
Hurry it up!

5931
03:21:53,580 --> 03:21:54,000
Oh, okay.

5932
03:21:54,080 --> 03:21:54,420
I found it.

5933
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:54,860
I found it.

5934
03:21:57,500 --> 03:21:57,940
Okay.

5935
03:21:58,220 --> 03:21:59,060
That went better!

5936
03:21:59,060 --> 03:21:59,560
Yeah!

5937
03:22:00,060 --> 03:22:02,260
That was way smoother than before.

5938
03:22:02,600 --> 03:22:02,720
Yeah!

5939
03:22:03,700 --> 03:22:04,740
What happened last time?

5940
03:22:04,740 --> 03:22:06,140
When I get to take your loot.

5941
03:22:07,020 --> 03:22:08,120
Yeah, take it, take it.

5942
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:09,700
Get them skill points.

5943
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:11,120
Wait.

5944
03:22:11,420 --> 03:22:12,380
I can't pick this up.

5945
03:22:12,440 --> 03:22:13,100
Oh, yes I can!

5946
03:22:15,020 --> 03:22:16,620
And skill points!

5947
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:17,700
And loot!

5948
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:19,560
Loot, loot, loot!

5949
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:22,020
Loot and skill points!

5950
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:22,620
Skill points!

5951
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:23,240
Maybe...

5952
03:22:23,240 --> 03:22:26,280
I think if we open this, hopefully it's a checkpoint, so...

5953
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:27,580
It better be.

5954
03:22:27,760 --> 03:22:28,280
Hopefully!

5955
03:22:29,060 --> 03:22:30,480
Please, game!

5956
03:22:30,960 --> 03:22:32,300
We've earned it!

5957
03:22:32,580 --> 03:22:33,000
Surely!

5958
03:22:33,400 --> 03:22:33,520
Surely!

5959
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:37,920
Well, they're gonna give us another boss.

5960
03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:39,460
No.

5961
03:22:41,440 --> 03:22:42,120
Take point!

5962
03:22:42,380 --> 03:22:43,120
Yippee!

5963
03:22:49,570 --> 03:22:50,170
Woah.

5964
03:22:50,910 --> 03:22:51,850
This is scary.

5965
03:22:52,290 --> 03:22:53,030
Oh!

5966
03:22:53,270 --> 03:22:55,290
I thought that was an alive person.

5967
03:22:59,560 --> 03:23:01,710
Why would that be an alive person?

5968
03:23:06,070 --> 03:23:07,910
I love how they drop ammo.

5969
03:23:08,330 --> 03:23:08,690
I know!

5970
03:23:09,070 --> 03:23:10,390
Even when it doesn't make any sense.

5971
03:23:10,990 --> 03:23:12,670
It doesn't make sense, but it...

5972
03:23:12,670 --> 03:23:13,630
It just works.

5973
03:23:15,210 --> 03:23:16,290
Scientist was killing...

5974
03:23:16,790 --> 03:23:17,970
Oh, it's this guy.

5975
03:23:19,890 --> 03:23:20,450
Oh!

5976
03:23:25,570 --> 03:23:27,090
Oh, my game is lagging!

5977
03:23:27,470 --> 03:23:28,130
Uh oh!

5978
03:23:28,810 --> 03:23:29,250
I'm okay!

5979
03:23:33,100 --> 03:23:33,980
Ow!

5980
03:23:34,120 --> 03:23:34,240
Ow!

5981
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:35,460
My game is lagging so bad!

5982
03:23:39,980 --> 03:23:41,460
Yeah, shut up!

5983
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:42,020
Shut up!

5984
03:23:42,580 --> 03:23:42,900
Stupid!

5985
03:23:43,840 --> 03:23:44,320
Oh!

5986
03:23:48,470 --> 03:23:49,350
Ouchie!

5987
03:23:49,790 --> 03:23:50,570
Ouchie!

5988
03:23:51,250 --> 03:23:51,890
Thank you!

5989
03:23:53,730 --> 03:23:54,610
Nice!

5990
03:23:55,110 --> 03:23:55,470
Oh!

5991
03:23:57,210 --> 03:23:57,890
Ow!

5992
03:23:58,050 --> 03:23:58,110
Ow!

5993
03:23:58,790 --> 03:23:59,150
Ow!

5994
03:23:59,610 --> 03:24:00,190
Oh!

5995
03:24:00,190 --> 03:24:01,150
Oh my gosh!

5996
03:24:01,570 --> 03:24:03,370
They all started coming out of nowhere!

5997
03:24:05,230 --> 03:24:06,250
Oh, they...

5998
03:24:06,250 --> 03:24:07,470
They could overwhelm us.

5999
03:24:07,570 --> 03:24:08,850
They could overwhelm us.

6000
03:24:09,010 --> 03:24:09,570
Indeed.

6001
03:24:10,870 --> 03:24:11,550
Okay.

6002
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:26,010
You're here?

6003
03:24:26,370 --> 03:24:27,330
Through the chute?

6004
03:24:27,630 --> 03:24:28,170
Okay!

6005
03:24:28,950 --> 03:24:30,670
Hold on, I'm grabbing some guns.

6006
03:24:31,050 --> 03:24:31,870
I'm grabbing some...

6007
03:24:31,870 --> 03:24:32,210
Okay.

6008
03:24:32,210 --> 03:24:33,170
I can watch you.

6009
03:24:34,370 --> 03:24:34,730
Grab...

6010
03:24:34,730 --> 03:24:35,350
Okay, okay!

6011
03:24:36,650 --> 03:24:37,330
Oh!

6012
03:24:41,370 --> 03:24:42,610
Found the garbage!

6013
03:24:42,890 --> 03:24:43,010
Shoot!

6014
03:24:43,170 --> 03:24:44,750
This always seems like a horrible idea.

6015
03:24:45,450 --> 03:24:45,670
I know!

6016
03:24:45,810 --> 03:24:47,750
What if we just drop into a pit of them?

6017
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:48,790
Like...

6018
03:24:48,790 --> 03:24:49,130
Yeah!

6019
03:24:49,910 --> 03:24:51,890
Or like a crusher where the...

6020
03:24:51,890 --> 03:24:54,290
The walls are slowly coming in.

6021
03:24:55,410 --> 03:24:55,670
Oh!

6022
03:24:56,350 --> 03:24:57,610
That's so Indiana Jones.

6023
03:24:58,830 --> 03:24:59,450
Wait.

6024
03:24:59,830 --> 03:25:00,790
This feels...

6025
03:25:00,790 --> 03:25:00,970
Wait.

6026
03:25:01,090 --> 03:25:02,210
Now we're like in a cave.

6027
03:25:02,930 --> 03:25:03,610
I know!

6028
03:25:04,850 --> 03:25:05,770
What is...

6029
03:25:05,770 --> 03:25:06,410
What's happening?

6030
03:25:06,410 --> 03:25:07,170
Find Debra.

6031
03:25:07,910 --> 03:25:08,390
We're...

6032
03:25:08,390 --> 03:25:08,670
We're...

6033
03:25:08,670 --> 03:25:09,590
Oh, we're still looking for her?

6034
03:25:10,990 --> 03:25:11,470
Yeah?

6035
03:25:11,730 --> 03:25:12,730
Why can't you fill me in yet?

6036
03:25:13,030 --> 03:25:13,210
Yeah.

6037
03:25:14,290 --> 03:25:16,050
Because you probably wouldn't believe me.

6038
03:25:16,550 --> 03:25:17,890
That's why I want to show you.

6039
03:25:18,010 --> 03:25:20,250
I think I would believe anything in this thing.

6040
03:25:20,790 --> 03:25:23,130
I think there's alligators down here.

6041
03:25:23,390 --> 03:25:23,630
Oh!

6042
03:25:23,810 --> 03:25:24,610
I hope so!

6043
03:25:24,770 --> 03:25:26,430
I've been waiting for alligators.

6044
03:25:27,170 --> 03:25:27,650
Nice!

6045
03:25:28,990 --> 03:25:29,390
View!

6046
03:25:29,390 --> 03:25:29,610
Cool!

6047
03:25:30,890 --> 03:25:32,250
Wow!

6048
03:25:34,930 --> 03:25:37,570
We're suddenly at RE7.

6049
03:25:40,110 --> 03:25:40,630
Yeah, Ryan.

6050
03:25:45,390 --> 03:25:48,590
Is she jealous?

6051
03:25:49,270 --> 03:25:49,570
Ooh!

6052
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:51,390
Helena jealous?

6053
03:25:53,970 --> 03:25:55,250
Ancient pottery?

6054
03:25:55,250 --> 03:25:57,110
Yeah, who cares about the...

6055
03:25:57,110 --> 03:25:58,310
Priceless ancient pottery?

6056
03:25:58,770 --> 03:26:00,590
Yeah, who cares about the...

6057
03:26:03,340 --> 03:26:05,620
I don't care about no pottery.

6058
03:26:08,900 --> 03:26:10,100
Are you good?

6059
03:26:10,620 --> 03:26:15,470
I just need a little...

6060
03:26:15,470 --> 03:26:16,210
A little boost.

6061
03:26:16,370 --> 03:26:17,270
A little spritz.

6062
03:26:17,390 --> 03:26:17,910
A little pick me up.

6063
03:26:18,070 --> 03:26:18,270
Yeah.

6064
03:26:19,830 --> 03:26:21,130
A little dry shampoo.

6065
03:26:21,850 --> 03:26:22,150
Oh!

6066
03:26:23,670 --> 03:26:24,530
You good?

6067
03:26:25,910 --> 03:26:26,730
Oh, yeah.

6068
03:26:27,210 --> 03:26:27,750
Oh, yeah.

6069
03:26:28,170 --> 03:26:28,250
Oh, yeah.

6070
03:26:28,550 --> 03:26:29,170
Where are you?

6071
03:26:29,910 --> 03:26:31,790
Why would Debra be down here?

6072
03:26:32,390 --> 03:26:33,330
I don't know.

6073
03:26:34,030 --> 03:26:36,370
It's like your girl's dead, bro.

6074
03:26:38,330 --> 03:26:39,710
She's a good one.

6075
03:26:40,170 --> 03:26:40,650
Thanks!

6076
03:26:42,790 --> 03:26:43,710
Is that her?

6077
03:26:43,930 --> 03:26:45,650
Debra has no pants on!

6078
03:26:45,770 --> 03:26:46,730
She's kind of cute!

6079
03:26:46,730 --> 03:26:50,690
Yeah, why is she wearing the little 90s, little baby doll?

6080
03:26:52,010 --> 03:26:53,870
This is definitely a boss arena.

6081
03:26:56,750 --> 03:26:57,250
Debra!

6082
03:26:58,550 --> 03:26:59,050
Debra!

6083
03:26:59,810 --> 03:27:00,890
What's she wearing?

6084
03:27:00,890 --> 03:27:03,030
This is what she wanted to show us.

6085
03:27:03,710 --> 03:27:04,030
Yeah!

6086
03:27:04,630 --> 03:27:08,810
She was like, you'd never believe me if I told you that Debra only walks around in her underwear.

6087
03:27:10,810 --> 03:27:12,690
I wanted to show you instead.

6088
03:27:13,590 --> 03:27:15,630
Thank you for showing me.

6089
03:27:17,390 --> 03:27:17,910
Okay.

6090
03:27:18,510 --> 03:27:19,690
Enough with the mystery.

6091
03:27:20,270 --> 03:27:21,630
What the hell is going on here?

6092
03:27:22,010 --> 03:27:23,390
Let's just get her out of here.

6093
03:27:24,350 --> 03:27:25,890
Oh my gosh, Helena, please!

6094
03:27:29,830 --> 03:27:31,210
Please, Helena!

6095
03:27:31,570 --> 03:27:32,850
You're driving me crazy.

6096
03:27:33,090 --> 03:27:33,250
Oh no.

6097
03:27:33,330 --> 03:27:33,810
I know!

6098
03:27:34,370 --> 03:27:35,330
Is this an escort mission?

6099
03:27:35,850 --> 03:27:37,670
Oh no, it probably is.

6100
03:27:37,910 --> 03:27:39,590
You have to carry her!

6101
03:27:39,590 --> 03:27:40,510
Ha ha!

6102
03:27:40,810 --> 03:27:41,110
No!

6103
03:27:43,490 --> 03:27:44,390
Oh, okay.

6104
03:27:44,610 --> 03:27:46,170
We leave the hostiles to you.

6105
03:27:46,610 --> 03:27:46,810
Oh!

6106
03:27:47,250 --> 03:27:48,090
Wait, wait.

6107
03:27:48,410 --> 03:27:50,290
I can't shoot or do anything, actually.

6108
03:27:50,510 --> 03:27:51,030
You can't?

6109
03:27:51,250 --> 03:27:51,430
No!

6110
03:27:52,070 --> 03:27:53,150
Are we going...

6111
03:27:53,150 --> 03:27:53,730
Where are we going?

6112
03:27:54,690 --> 03:27:55,750
I can do...

6113
03:27:55,750 --> 03:27:57,550
Do you guys see the cheeks?

6114
03:27:58,250 --> 03:27:58,670
Wow!

6115
03:27:59,190 --> 03:27:59,370
Wait!

6116
03:28:00,230 --> 03:28:01,350
Show me, show me!

6117
03:28:01,810 --> 03:28:02,070
Oh!

6118
03:28:02,070 --> 03:28:02,290
Oh!

6119
03:28:05,170 --> 03:28:06,130
We're going...

6120
03:28:06,130 --> 03:28:06,530
Down?

6121
03:28:07,670 --> 03:28:07,890
Down?

6122
03:28:12,130 --> 03:28:13,050
Wait, where are you going?

6123
03:28:13,550 --> 03:28:13,850
Classic.

6124
03:28:13,850 --> 03:28:14,970
The only way out now is down.

6125
03:28:15,310 --> 03:28:15,690
Okay.

6126
03:28:16,250 --> 03:28:17,570
Oh, that's where we came from, right?

6127
03:28:21,470 --> 03:28:22,510
Wait, where'd you go?

6128
03:28:22,670 --> 03:28:23,110
I'm right here.

6129
03:28:23,530 --> 03:28:25,910
I've already failed my escort mission.

6130
03:28:26,210 --> 03:28:27,990
I think I hear Zombos down here.

6131
03:28:30,530 --> 03:28:31,470
I'll fight them.

6132
03:28:31,970 --> 03:28:32,870
Or I hear Debra.

6133
03:28:33,030 --> 03:28:33,890
Debra's kinda loud.

6134
03:28:34,230 --> 03:28:34,950
I'm not gonna lie.

6135
03:28:35,430 --> 03:28:35,770
Really?

6136
03:28:35,770 --> 03:28:37,750
Yeah, she's like moaning and groaning.

6137
03:28:37,770 --> 03:28:38,670
I can't hear it all.

6138
03:28:41,890 --> 03:28:42,410
Oh!

6139
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:43,750
Leave it to you!

6140
03:28:48,190 --> 03:28:49,070
I've got it.

6141
03:28:49,750 --> 03:28:51,030
You like tripped.

6142
03:28:51,630 --> 03:28:52,150
Nice.

6143
03:28:58,340 --> 03:28:59,900
Nah, I really can't do anything.

6144
03:29:00,300 --> 03:29:01,160
This kinda sucks.

6145
03:29:02,460 --> 03:29:02,980
Sorry.

6146
03:29:03,580 --> 03:29:05,840
What are you supposed to do in single player mode?

6147
03:29:07,520 --> 03:29:08,640
Probably your partner.

6148
03:29:08,820 --> 03:29:10,020
You still get a partner, right?

6149
03:29:10,020 --> 03:29:10,840
Oh, true, true.

6150
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:11,300
AI.

6151
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:20,340
Yeah, we should be able to swing Debra around like a weapon.

6152
03:29:20,720 --> 03:29:21,460
You should!

6153
03:29:21,920 --> 03:29:23,380
Just grab her by your ankles.

6154
03:29:23,920 --> 03:29:25,360
Yeah, that would be awesome.

6155
03:29:26,120 --> 03:29:26,160
Swing!

6156
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:26,500
I don't know.

6157
03:29:26,600 --> 03:29:28,540
I get the feeling that Debra is evil.

6158
03:29:28,920 --> 03:29:31,460
Or at least she has some, like, part in this.

6159
03:29:31,640 --> 03:29:32,320
Oh, watch out!

6160
03:29:32,320 --> 03:29:32,520
Oh!

6161
03:29:33,960 --> 03:29:35,020
You're just stuck in the window!

6162
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:35,540
Watch out!

6163
03:29:40,620 --> 03:29:41,580
You got him.

6164
03:29:41,940 --> 03:29:43,480
I never doubted.

6165
03:29:44,220 --> 03:29:45,020
Oh my gosh!

6166
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:45,440
Oh!

6167
03:29:45,660 --> 03:29:46,360
Oh my gosh!

6168
03:29:46,920 --> 03:29:47,560
Watch out!

6169
03:29:47,660 --> 03:29:48,540
The roof is caving in!

6170
03:29:48,600 --> 03:29:49,140
What's happening?

6171
03:29:49,440 --> 03:29:50,140
Are you okay?

6172
03:29:50,500 --> 03:29:51,300
Yeah, I'm all right.

6173
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:52,360
Oh, watch out, watch out.

6174
03:29:53,840 --> 03:29:54,180
Yeah!

6175
03:29:54,880 --> 03:29:55,200
Double!

6176
03:29:55,540 --> 03:29:55,700
Double!

6177
03:29:56,120 --> 03:29:56,680
Yeah, nice.

6178
03:30:03,790 --> 03:30:05,770
Ooh, it's getting real shaky in here.

6179
03:30:06,250 --> 03:30:06,390
Yeah.

6180
03:30:06,750 --> 03:30:08,550
You think this rope bridge will hold?

6181
03:30:08,930 --> 03:30:09,390
Nope.

6182
03:30:11,850 --> 03:30:14,110
I can't with the shaky camera.

6183
03:30:14,310 --> 03:30:15,610
It's making me a little sick.

6184
03:30:15,930 --> 03:30:16,470
I know!

6185
03:30:20,430 --> 03:30:22,090
In the pre...

6186
03:30:22,090 --> 03:30:23,190
The pre-logue?

6187
03:30:23,230 --> 03:30:24,010
Pro-logue?

6188
03:30:24,010 --> 03:30:24,090
Uh-huh.

6189
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:28,630
It was especially bad when the helicopter crashed.

6190
03:30:28,630 --> 03:30:28,930
Yeah!

6191
03:30:29,530 --> 03:30:30,350
Remember that?

6192
03:30:30,610 --> 03:30:31,230
Yeah, I do.

6193
03:30:33,030 --> 03:30:35,510
Sorry that we didn't play it on stream, guys, but...

6194
03:30:35,510 --> 03:30:35,810
Yeah.

6195
03:30:36,150 --> 03:30:37,670
You didn't miss too much.

6196
03:30:37,970 --> 03:30:38,050
No.

6197
03:30:39,250 --> 03:30:40,830
We just got through the...

6198
03:30:40,830 --> 03:30:42,190
So we could activate the...

6199
03:30:42,190 --> 03:30:42,570
What's it called?

6200
03:30:43,130 --> 03:30:43,570
The...

6201
03:30:43,570 --> 03:30:44,210
Co-op?

6202
03:30:44,370 --> 03:30:45,030
Yeah, the co-op.

6203
03:30:49,490 --> 03:30:50,410
Are you alive?

6204
03:30:50,610 --> 03:30:50,830
Yep!

6205
03:30:51,010 --> 03:30:52,010
I'm right behind you.

6206
03:30:52,270 --> 03:30:53,750
I'm gathering all the things.

6207
03:30:54,850 --> 03:30:56,270
Can I help at least with this?

6208
03:30:56,450 --> 03:30:57,730
No, I can't do anything!

6209
03:30:59,150 --> 03:31:00,590
Don't worry, m'lady.

6210
03:31:00,830 --> 03:31:02,370
I will handle it for you.

6211
03:31:02,710 --> 03:31:05,150
Yeah, I'm getting the real princess treatment right now.

6212
03:31:08,330 --> 03:31:10,730
Debra's getting the real princess treatment.

6213
03:31:12,610 --> 03:31:13,230
Come on, Debra.

6214
03:31:13,330 --> 03:31:13,890
Wake up!

6215
03:31:14,510 --> 03:31:15,450
Pull your weight!

6216
03:31:16,250 --> 03:31:17,570
Why would she just like...

6217
03:31:17,570 --> 03:31:18,870
She's on a table.

6218
03:31:19,330 --> 03:31:19,890
Lounge.

6219
03:31:19,890 --> 03:31:20,190
Oh!

6220
03:31:20,330 --> 03:31:20,810
Oh!

6221
03:31:21,330 --> 03:31:21,890
Oh!

6222
03:31:21,890 --> 03:31:22,090
Oh!

6223
03:31:22,390 --> 03:31:22,950
Oh!

6224
03:31:27,310 --> 03:31:27,870
Okay.

6225
03:31:28,450 --> 03:31:28,950
Good job.

6226
03:31:28,950 --> 03:31:29,370
Are you good?

6227
03:31:29,570 --> 03:31:29,790
Yep.

6228
03:31:30,290 --> 03:31:31,110
I'm okay.

6229
03:31:31,470 --> 03:31:32,690
There's another one on the bridge though.

6230
03:31:32,890 --> 03:31:33,590
Oh, okay.

6231
03:31:34,610 --> 03:31:35,690
He's a little slow.

6232
03:31:37,750 --> 03:31:39,430
He's like actually really slow.

6233
03:31:39,550 --> 03:31:39,890
Oh!

6234
03:31:40,190 --> 03:31:40,390
Oh!

6235
03:31:40,730 --> 03:31:41,350
He spits.

6236
03:31:41,450 --> 03:31:42,250
He's spitting though.

6237
03:31:42,550 --> 03:31:43,670
He's got bars.

6238
03:31:46,770 --> 03:31:47,630
Sure does.

6239
03:31:51,070 --> 03:31:51,550
Onward.

6240
03:31:52,430 --> 03:31:53,490
Wait, is this the right way?

6241
03:31:53,730 --> 03:31:53,990
Yep.

6242
03:31:55,310 --> 03:31:56,290
Oh yeah, down here.

6243
03:31:56,290 --> 03:31:59,050
I mean, this looks like a boss arena.

6244
03:31:59,490 --> 03:32:01,330
I can't stop looking at her.

6245
03:32:01,850 --> 03:32:03,630
Her butt keeps boggling around.

6246
03:32:03,630 --> 03:32:05,670
I gotta check out your POV.

6247
03:32:08,230 --> 03:32:09,770
Debra has a bakery.

6248
03:32:10,130 --> 03:32:10,450
It's like...

6249
03:32:11,070 --> 03:32:11,150
Oh!

6250
03:32:11,270 --> 03:32:11,730
Debra.

6251
03:32:12,490 --> 03:32:13,490
Just hold on.

6252
03:32:13,570 --> 03:32:14,170
We're almost there.

6253
03:32:14,930 --> 03:32:16,510
Debra, stay with me, alright?

6254
03:32:16,850 --> 03:32:17,250
Uh oh.

6255
03:32:17,790 --> 03:32:18,370
Debra!

6256
03:32:19,250 --> 03:32:20,310
Oh, Debra!

6257
03:32:20,390 --> 03:32:21,330
Oh my god!

6258
03:32:24,650 --> 03:32:26,810
She turned into one of the gold people!

6259
03:32:28,210 --> 03:32:30,590
So Ada was born like this?

6260
03:32:32,550 --> 03:32:33,210
Oh!

6261
03:32:33,710 --> 03:32:35,750
And now Debra is born.

6262
03:32:37,590 --> 03:32:39,110
Is she gonna be cute?

6263
03:32:41,170 --> 03:32:45,370
Maybe if you were born cute, you will have to be reborn ugly.

6264
03:32:46,170 --> 03:32:46,310
Oh.

6265
03:32:52,050 --> 03:32:53,910
She's still reaching out for her.

6266
03:32:53,910 --> 03:32:54,750
Ada!

6267
03:32:55,390 --> 03:32:56,130
Oh my god!

6268
03:32:56,590 --> 03:32:57,010
Oh my god!

6269
03:33:01,550 --> 03:33:03,110
Oh, she's so cool!

6270
03:33:03,250 --> 03:33:04,270
With her crossbow!

6271
03:33:04,630 --> 03:33:04,770
I know.

6272
03:33:05,330 --> 03:33:05,650
Ada.

6273
03:33:07,610 --> 03:33:09,790
The true waifu is here.

6274
03:33:12,010 --> 03:33:13,190
Stares at the camera.

6275
03:33:13,290 --> 03:33:13,350
A ghost.

6276
03:33:13,590 --> 03:33:13,790
Up.

6277
03:33:18,840 --> 03:33:19,440
What?

6278
03:33:19,720 --> 03:33:19,980
What?

6279
03:33:20,140 --> 03:33:20,920
Put your gut down!

6280
03:33:21,140 --> 03:33:21,600
Who are...

6281
03:33:22,440 --> 03:33:23,740
Excuse me, ma'am.

6282
03:33:25,060 --> 03:33:25,660
Disrespect!

6283
03:33:26,240 --> 03:33:26,500
Yeah!

6284
03:33:27,460 --> 03:33:28,680
She saved you!

6285
03:33:29,720 --> 03:33:30,100
Ada.

6286
03:33:30,940 --> 03:33:31,440
Ada.

6287
03:33:31,440 --> 03:33:32,580
What the hell is going on here?

6288
03:33:33,200 --> 03:33:33,980
It's complicated.

6289
03:33:34,480 --> 03:33:36,300
Were you creating in a lab, Ada?

6290
03:33:37,780 --> 03:33:38,280
Ada?

6291
03:33:38,640 --> 03:33:40,100
Are you born from an egg?

6292
03:33:42,980 --> 03:33:45,440
But this isn't the time, or the place.

6293
03:33:46,500 --> 03:33:47,840
Now we gotta get out of here.

6294
03:33:48,300 --> 03:33:49,040
She's cool!

6295
03:33:49,460 --> 03:33:50,680
These walkways won't hold.

6296
03:33:50,960 --> 03:33:52,460
We need to get to the lower levels.

6297
03:33:52,460 --> 03:33:53,100
Oh.

6298
03:33:53,100 --> 03:33:54,300
So sorry, Debra.

6299
03:33:54,540 --> 03:33:54,680
Wait!

6300
03:33:54,820 --> 03:33:55,200
Oh!

6301
03:33:55,940 --> 03:33:56,300
So bad.

6302
03:33:56,640 --> 03:33:57,180
No, yeah!

6303
03:33:57,260 --> 03:33:58,320
She actually looks kinda normal.

6304
03:33:58,540 --> 03:33:59,080
Uh-oh.

6305
03:33:59,920 --> 03:34:00,980
I spoke too soon!

6306
03:34:00,980 --> 03:34:02,520
We might have been able to let her cook a little longer.

6307
03:34:02,860 --> 03:34:03,060
You know?

6308
03:34:04,440 --> 03:34:05,200
Oh shoot!

6309
03:34:05,520 --> 03:34:06,380
Oh my gosh!

6310
03:34:07,700 --> 03:34:09,620
Wait, am I not gonna be Helena anymore?

6311
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:11,480
Oh wait, I have to get out of this.

6312
03:34:11,620 --> 03:34:13,080
Actually, it's kinda messed up.

6313
03:34:13,080 --> 03:34:13,780
I don't know how to help you!

6314
03:34:13,860 --> 03:34:14,660
I don't know how to help you!

6315
03:34:14,820 --> 03:34:15,800
Wow, this is crazy!

6316
03:34:16,280 --> 03:34:17,240
This is crazy!

6317
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:19,800
Can I show this on stream?

6318
03:34:25,080 --> 03:34:25,520
Wait.

6319
03:34:28,560 --> 03:34:29,360
Is it all me?

6320
03:34:29,820 --> 03:34:30,560
No way.

6321
03:34:33,160 --> 03:34:34,560
Are we separated again?

6322
03:34:34,740 --> 03:34:34,940
Yeah.

6323
03:34:35,480 --> 03:34:36,240
But you have Ada.

6324
03:34:37,680 --> 03:34:38,080
Yeah.

6325
03:34:39,280 --> 03:34:39,720
Debra!

6326
03:34:39,940 --> 03:34:40,780
It should've been me!

6327
03:34:43,500 --> 03:34:45,800
Hey, you got to see Debra's bakery.

6328
03:34:46,200 --> 03:34:46,660
But that...

6329
03:34:46,660 --> 03:34:48,160
I had a really...

6330
03:34:48,160 --> 03:34:48,340
I had a...

6331
03:34:48,340 --> 03:34:49,020
I had a show.

6332
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:53,080
Oh, that guy just dropped and...

6333
03:35:00,720 --> 03:35:01,220
Oh!

6334
03:35:01,940 --> 03:35:02,340
Whoa!

6335
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:02,880
Ada!

6336
03:35:03,400 --> 03:35:03,520
Ada!

6337
03:35:03,600 --> 03:35:04,200
It's crazy!

6338
03:35:05,700 --> 03:35:06,380
What's happening?

6339
03:35:06,460 --> 03:35:08,520
I just see her swing from my feet!

6340
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:11,100
Oh my god!

6341
03:35:11,100 --> 03:35:12,160
That'll make sense later.

6342
03:35:12,660 --> 03:35:13,160
Wait.

6343
03:35:13,280 --> 03:35:13,480
Okay.

6344
03:35:13,480 --> 03:35:16,580
You think all of the stories intersect then?

6345
03:35:16,800 --> 03:35:17,880
I guess so, right?

6346
03:35:18,120 --> 03:35:18,260
Wait.

6347
03:35:18,400 --> 03:35:18,720
What's...

6348
03:35:18,720 --> 03:35:19,320
Why can't I...

6349
03:35:19,320 --> 03:35:19,780
Oh, there we go.

6350
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:24,620
I'm just shooting zombies.

6351
03:35:25,440 --> 03:35:25,920
Boring!

6352
03:35:28,060 --> 03:35:29,560
I'm right below you now.

6353
03:35:30,620 --> 03:35:31,820
Yeah, I'm being a little slow.

6354
03:35:31,980 --> 03:35:33,520
Cause I'm trying to get stuff.

6355
03:35:34,700 --> 03:35:35,020
Nothing.

6356
03:35:36,360 --> 03:35:36,840
Stingy.

6357
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:37,200
Oh.

6358
03:35:39,040 --> 03:35:40,880
I don't know where that is.

6359
03:35:43,480 --> 03:35:44,080
Um...

6360
03:35:44,080 --> 03:35:44,780
Oh, Debra.

6361
03:35:44,900 --> 03:35:45,360
Can I go down?

6362
03:35:45,840 --> 03:35:47,240
Oh, can you pull that lever?

6363
03:35:47,420 --> 03:35:47,580
Yep.

6364
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:49,600
Yay!

6365
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:51,900
Oh.

6366
03:35:52,500 --> 03:35:53,780
Are we gonna swing again?

6367
03:35:54,420 --> 03:35:55,380
I wanna watch.

6368
03:35:55,480 --> 03:35:56,720
Let go, Ada!

6369
03:35:58,880 --> 03:35:59,480
Wee!

6370
03:35:59,760 --> 03:36:00,360
Hi!

6371
03:36:01,440 --> 03:36:02,580
I got Debra!

6372
03:36:02,580 --> 03:36:02,760
Run!

6373
03:36:03,340 --> 03:36:03,940
Ah!

6374
03:36:04,300 --> 03:36:05,360
Oh my god!

6375
03:36:05,780 --> 03:36:06,520
Watch out, you two.

6376
03:36:06,840 --> 03:36:07,580
She's strong.

6377
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:09,820
Watch out for yourself.

6378
03:36:10,400 --> 03:36:11,720
Holy moly!

6379
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:12,320
Where?

6380
03:36:12,320 --> 03:36:13,440
I can't put this on...

6381
03:36:13,440 --> 03:36:14,940
Show this on TV.

6382
03:36:15,460 --> 03:36:16,260
Oh my gosh!

6383
03:36:20,580 --> 03:36:21,180
Oh!

6384
03:36:22,020 --> 03:36:22,380
Is that...

6385
03:36:22,380 --> 03:36:22,600
Oh!

6386
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:23,100
Oh!

6387
03:36:23,240 --> 03:36:23,740
Was that it?

6388
03:36:24,320 --> 03:36:24,880
Down

6389
03:36:27,980 --> 03:36:28,840
there so fast!

6390
03:36:29,200 --> 03:36:29,760
You!

6391
03:36:30,680 --> 03:36:32,500
You need to get over her.

6392
03:36:32,620 --> 03:36:33,000
I know.

6393
03:36:33,520 --> 03:36:34,380
Oh, wait.

6394
03:36:34,900 --> 03:36:38,700
Time for a different...

6395
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:39,700
Oh, she's...

6396
03:36:39,700 --> 03:36:41,160
She reminds me of a frog.

6397
03:36:41,360 --> 03:36:42,060
You should put her down.

6398
03:36:43,380 --> 03:36:44,440
That's very cute.

6399
03:36:44,640 --> 03:36:45,460
I like frogs.

6400
03:36:45,820 --> 03:36:46,000
Wait.

6401
03:36:46,340 --> 03:36:47,240
That's a buggy hero.

6402
03:36:47,260 --> 03:36:47,800
This is a nightmare.

6403
03:36:48,280 --> 03:36:48,440
Yeah.

6404
03:36:48,740 --> 03:36:49,700
It can't be real!

6405
03:36:51,400 --> 03:36:51,960
Try

6406
03:36:56,300 --> 03:36:57,420
to be a scorpion.

6407
03:36:57,720 --> 03:36:58,040
Yeah.

6408
03:36:59,220 --> 03:37:01,100
Got that froggy snabbiness.

6409
03:37:01,940 --> 03:37:02,240
Yeah.

6410
03:37:02,240 --> 03:37:02,340
Yeah.

6411
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:03,760
That's true.

6412
03:37:04,440 --> 03:37:04,780
Mm-mm.

6413
03:37:05,520 --> 03:37:06,140
I see...

6414
03:37:06,140 --> 03:37:06,320
Yeah.

6415
03:37:06,560 --> 03:37:07,200
Scorpion too.

6416
03:37:09,700 --> 03:37:10,640
Oh, Debra.

6417
03:37:12,140 --> 03:37:15,020
I feel like if we let her incubate a little longer...

6418
03:37:15,020 --> 03:37:16,480
Maybe she would've come out like Ada.

6419
03:37:16,680 --> 03:37:17,020
Yeah!

6420
03:37:17,820 --> 03:37:18,580
Ada's fine.

6421
03:37:18,740 --> 03:37:19,420
What happened to you?

6422
03:37:19,540 --> 03:37:19,700
Wait.

6423
03:37:19,760 --> 03:37:20,360
Is this TNT?

6424
03:37:20,760 --> 03:37:21,900
I think that's Dying Way.

6425
03:37:22,080 --> 03:37:23,360
Are we supposed to blow her up?

6426
03:37:23,460 --> 03:37:23,980
I think so.

6427
03:37:25,060 --> 03:37:25,420
Oh!

6428
03:37:25,860 --> 03:37:26,220
Oh!

6429
03:37:31,420 --> 03:37:32,920
She came right at me.

6430
03:37:33,380 --> 03:37:34,140
You okay?

6431
03:37:34,860 --> 03:37:35,000
Yep.

6432
03:37:36,520 --> 03:37:36,720
Wait.

6433
03:37:36,980 --> 03:37:37,900
Give me them skill points.

6434
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:40,760
Oh, there's zombies coming down too.

6435
03:37:44,280 --> 03:37:44,760
Chomping?

6436
03:37:45,720 --> 03:37:46,680
Chomping on the guy?

6437
03:37:48,320 --> 03:37:48,800
Yeah.

6438
03:37:48,980 --> 03:37:49,840
She's breakdancing.

6439
03:37:49,860 --> 03:37:50,960
I like when she does that.

6440
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:51,260
Ah!

6441
03:37:54,720 --> 03:37:57,060
I like when she jumps and pins me down.

6442
03:38:02,480 --> 03:38:03,700
She's like a flower.

6443
03:38:03,840 --> 03:38:05,060
A beautiful flower.

6444
03:38:05,220 --> 03:38:06,740
A beautiful flower, Debra.

6445
03:38:08,020 --> 03:38:09,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6446
03:38:11,740 --> 03:38:14,560
I'm trying to get her out over here by the TNT.

6447
03:38:19,540 --> 03:38:21,320
Oh, gosh, she got me again.

6448
03:38:22,020 --> 03:38:22,420
Uh oh.

6449
03:38:23,160 --> 03:38:23,540
It's okay.

6450
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:25,100
I ate my pills.

6451
03:38:28,820 --> 03:38:29,900
Breakdancing, Debra.

6452
03:38:33,440 --> 03:38:34,620
Is she crying?

6453
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:36,000
Nah, she's like...

6454
03:38:36,400 --> 03:38:37,860
I think she's being sexy.

6455
03:38:40,160 --> 03:38:40,800
Yeah.

6456
03:38:41,560 --> 03:38:42,900
I would say so.

6457
03:38:43,240 --> 03:38:43,560
Yeah.

6458
03:38:44,180 --> 03:38:44,620
Oh.

6459
03:38:53,900 --> 03:38:54,920
Oh, we got her!

6460
03:38:59,320 --> 03:38:59,760
Helena!

6461
03:39:00,040 --> 03:39:00,520
Oh, we're fine.

6462
03:39:00,720 --> 03:39:01,500
Oh, we didn't get her.

6463
03:39:02,120 --> 03:39:02,620
I think.

6464
03:39:02,800 --> 03:39:03,900
Oh, now are you with Ada?

6465
03:39:04,320 --> 03:39:04,680
Yeah.

6466
03:39:05,860 --> 03:39:06,000
Oh.

6467
03:39:08,120 --> 03:39:08,560
Sorry.

6468
03:39:09,060 --> 03:39:10,660
You're gonna get to swing.

6469
03:39:11,320 --> 03:39:12,580
I stole your girl.

6470
03:39:14,660 --> 03:39:15,900
I don't know if I'm swinging.

6471
03:39:16,180 --> 03:39:16,700
Oh, my gosh.

6472
03:39:16,920 --> 03:39:18,380
She jumped right on top of me.

6473
03:39:19,400 --> 03:39:19,520
Oh.

6474
03:39:20,960 --> 03:39:21,480
Oh.

6475
03:39:21,480 --> 03:39:21,840
Ada!

6476
03:39:22,240 --> 03:39:22,700
Helena!

6477
03:39:23,140 --> 03:39:24,040
A little help here?

6478
03:39:24,740 --> 03:39:25,040
What?

6479
03:39:25,560 --> 03:39:28,440
The more things change, the more things change.

6480
03:39:28,480 --> 03:39:29,740
Oh, am I supposed to help you?

6481
03:39:29,920 --> 03:39:30,400
Like, okay.

6482
03:39:30,480 --> 03:39:30,880
I don't know.

6483
03:39:31,240 --> 03:39:31,480
Oh.

6484
03:39:32,220 --> 03:39:33,220
I think so.

6485
03:39:33,360 --> 03:39:34,040
I'm just running.

6486
03:39:34,440 --> 03:39:34,700
Okay.

6487
03:39:36,600 --> 03:39:38,400
Um, I'll get my sniper out.

6488
03:39:38,660 --> 03:39:39,340
Oh, sorry.

6489
03:39:39,680 --> 03:39:39,940
Ada.

6490
03:39:40,280 --> 03:39:41,440
Don't mean the disrespect.

6491
03:39:42,060 --> 03:39:42,320
Oh.

6492
03:39:44,720 --> 03:39:45,200
Oh.

6493
03:39:45,400 --> 03:39:46,420
Are you supposed to jump?

6494
03:39:46,680 --> 03:39:47,400
Where you guys...

6495
03:39:47,400 --> 03:39:48,140
You guys are going down.

6496
03:39:48,140 --> 03:39:49,460
I don't know what we're doing.

6497
03:39:49,960 --> 03:39:52,440
I think I'm supposed to help, like, clear the path for you.

6498
03:39:52,560 --> 03:39:53,060
But it's...

6499
03:39:53,060 --> 03:39:54,220
It's really difficult.

6500
03:39:54,940 --> 03:39:55,400
It's okay.

6501
03:39:55,420 --> 03:39:56,920
I'll just run past them.

6502
03:39:57,180 --> 03:39:57,460
Oh.

6503
03:39:57,560 --> 03:39:58,800
I wasn't even reloading.

6504
03:39:59,660 --> 03:40:00,000
Yeah.

6505
03:40:00,040 --> 03:40:00,700
Just run past.

6506
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:02,660
Ada's doing a fine job, honestly.

6507
03:40:05,900 --> 03:40:06,860
She's carrying.

6508
03:40:07,260 --> 03:40:09,580
I'm not gonna waste my ammo on those guys.

6509
03:40:09,580 --> 03:40:10,620
I mean...

6510
03:40:13,680 --> 03:40:14,160
This

6511
03:40:17,450 --> 03:40:18,910
guy wearing, like, medieval armor.

6512
03:40:20,190 --> 03:40:21,150
Where are we?

6513
03:40:21,230 --> 03:40:21,910
Where are...

6514
03:40:21,910 --> 03:40:22,090
Yeah.

6515
03:40:22,690 --> 03:40:23,450
When are...

6516
03:40:25,590 --> 03:40:26,770
Now I wanna be sexy, Deborah.

6517
03:40:26,790 --> 03:40:27,930
Wait, you're still going down?

6518
03:40:28,470 --> 03:40:28,950
Yeah.

6519
03:40:30,030 --> 03:40:30,510
Um...

6520
03:40:30,510 --> 03:40:31,410
I don't know.

6521
03:40:31,750 --> 03:40:32,910
I don't know when it stops.

6522
03:40:34,690 --> 03:40:36,050
He's trying to chase you.

6523
03:40:36,890 --> 03:40:37,810
Oh, it stopped.

6524
03:40:38,870 --> 03:40:40,210
It's still shaky, though.

6525
03:40:40,370 --> 03:40:41,170
It's really shaky.

6526
03:40:41,430 --> 03:40:42,190
How do I get out?

6527
03:40:42,970 --> 03:40:43,850
Ada, how do we get out?

6528
03:40:45,130 --> 03:40:45,610
Ada.

6529
03:40:46,270 --> 03:40:46,910
Ada.

6530
03:40:47,090 --> 03:40:48,370
Like an ancient temple.

6531
03:40:48,730 --> 03:40:49,210
Ada.

6532
03:40:49,370 --> 03:40:49,950
How do we...

6533
03:40:49,950 --> 03:40:50,770
Let me let you out.

6534
03:40:51,210 --> 03:40:52,790
Oh, you let me out.

6535
03:40:53,070 --> 03:40:53,210
Okay.

6536
03:40:54,770 --> 03:40:55,870
Oh, hello.

6537
03:40:57,470 --> 03:40:58,110
Ladies.

6538
03:40:59,690 --> 03:41:01,490
Your Uber is here.

6539
03:41:04,410 --> 03:41:05,810
What is she shooting at?

6540
03:41:07,430 --> 03:41:08,370
I'm coming.

6541
03:41:09,150 --> 03:41:09,430
I'm coming.

6542
03:41:11,570 --> 03:41:12,150
Hello.

6543
03:41:13,690 --> 03:41:15,750
Let's hope this is non-stop right out of here.

6544
03:41:16,930 --> 03:41:18,110
What just happened?

6545
03:41:19,070 --> 03:41:20,610
We gotta dodge.

6546
03:41:21,210 --> 03:41:22,000
Oh, what are we dodging?

6547
03:41:22,850 --> 03:41:23,350
Oh my god.

6548
03:41:25,410 --> 03:41:26,690
Oh my god.

6549
03:41:27,190 --> 03:41:27,750
Stay down.

6550
03:41:28,790 --> 03:41:30,730
We need to just stay down.

6551
03:41:30,730 --> 03:41:31,610
Oh, for real.

6552
03:41:33,750 --> 03:41:34,610
Just stop.

6553
03:41:34,770 --> 03:41:34,770
We

6554
03:41:38,820 --> 03:41:40,700
need to dodge while fighting her.

6555
03:41:41,140 --> 03:41:41,740
It's too much.

6556
03:41:41,800 --> 03:41:42,660
No, no way.

6557
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:46,700
Debra, this isn't you.

6558
03:41:49,100 --> 03:41:51,580
It doesn't have to be like this, Debra.

6559
03:41:51,720 --> 03:41:52,560
Oh, we can run her over.

6560
03:41:53,520 --> 03:41:54,480
Oh, Debra.

6561
03:41:55,060 --> 03:41:57,080
Debra doesn't care if she's run over or not.

6562
03:41:57,080 --> 03:41:58,620
She's not coming over that time.

6563
03:41:58,920 --> 03:42:00,140
She's trying to kill you.

6564
03:42:00,520 --> 03:42:01,580
Don't you think I know that?

6565
03:42:06,500 --> 03:42:07,240
Oh, gosh.

6566
03:42:07,700 --> 03:42:09,240
I don't know what I'm supposed to be hitting her.

6567
03:42:09,400 --> 03:42:11,460
Little spawns or...

6568
03:42:11,460 --> 03:42:13,340
Are they hitting her glowy spots?

6569
03:42:13,340 --> 03:42:14,240
Yeah, the glowy spots.

6570
03:42:14,460 --> 03:42:17,080
I've been trying to hit her, but the glowy spots makes more sense.

6571
03:42:24,300 --> 03:42:25,140
Oh, shoot.

6572
03:42:26,680 --> 03:42:27,480
Ada's fine though.

6573
03:42:27,660 --> 03:42:28,340
She doesn't need anything.

6574
03:42:29,180 --> 03:42:29,860
Smack me.

6575
03:42:29,860 --> 03:42:32,940
Oh, you're giving me smelling sauce.

6576
03:42:33,800 --> 03:42:34,900
I am.

6577
03:42:43,050 --> 03:42:44,590
I mean, not Ada, Debra.

6578
03:42:47,450 --> 03:42:48,650
Too many...

6579
03:42:48,650 --> 03:42:49,430
Too many women.

6580
03:42:49,610 --> 03:42:50,690
Wait, this seems so fun.

6581
03:42:52,070 --> 03:42:52,850
It's like Donkey Kong.

6582
03:42:53,090 --> 03:42:53,330
Oh, dodge.

6583
03:42:54,890 --> 03:42:55,630
Oh, dodge.

6584
03:42:57,970 --> 03:43:00,050
Ada is probably like these idiots.

6585
03:43:02,050 --> 03:43:03,230
Oh my god.

6586
03:43:05,650 --> 03:43:06,230
Oh my god.

6587
03:43:06,270 --> 03:43:07,990
Why can't I stay down?

6588
03:43:08,790 --> 03:43:09,750
I know.

6589
03:43:10,590 --> 03:43:11,210
I know.

6590
03:43:11,530 --> 03:43:12,490
Just stay down.

6591
03:43:12,750 --> 03:43:13,790
It's not worth it.

6592
03:43:14,530 --> 03:43:15,890
At least we reached the checkpoint.

6593
03:43:16,330 --> 03:43:16,670
Oh, yeah.

6594
03:43:20,050 --> 03:43:20,950
Oh my god.

6595
03:43:21,350 --> 03:43:21,930
Oh

6596
03:43:25,990 --> 03:43:26,270
my god.

6597
03:43:26,470 --> 03:43:27,210
Oh, it's so much harder.

6598
03:43:27,870 --> 03:43:28,770
Ouchie, ouchie.

6599
03:43:29,090 --> 03:43:29,470
Uh oh.

6600
03:43:30,230 --> 03:43:32,650
I get hit into a cutscene every time.

6601
03:43:34,950 --> 03:43:36,210
Save us, cutscene.

6602
03:43:36,330 --> 03:43:37,010
Save us.

6603
03:43:40,610 --> 03:43:42,390
Oh, she better not die.

6604
03:43:44,690 --> 03:43:45,350
Oh my god.

6605
03:43:45,350 --> 03:43:46,050
Ada can't die.

6606
03:43:46,550 --> 03:43:48,030
Nah, I don't think Ada will die.

6607
03:43:48,690 --> 03:43:48,730
Oh.

6608
03:43:49,550 --> 03:43:49,930
Debra!

6609
03:43:50,510 --> 03:43:51,010
Debra!

6610
03:43:51,370 --> 03:43:52,730
Debra, this isn't like you.

6611
03:43:54,110 --> 03:43:55,210
Oh, I gotta reload.

6612
03:43:55,490 --> 03:43:55,590
Never mind.

6613
03:43:55,810 --> 03:43:56,390
What do I do?

6614
03:43:57,450 --> 03:43:58,490
Oh, Debra!

6615
03:44:02,780 --> 03:44:04,960
I was trying to shoot...

6616
03:44:04,960 --> 03:44:05,800
I wish.

6617
03:44:06,040 --> 03:44:07,580
She's got physics and everything.

6618
03:44:08,040 --> 03:44:08,660
I know.

6619
03:44:13,760 --> 03:44:15,360
Wait, did I let Ada die?

6620
03:44:15,780 --> 03:44:16,340
I might have.

6621
03:44:16,560 --> 03:44:17,180
No, she's fine.

6622
03:44:17,300 --> 03:44:17,740
She's fine, she's fine.

6623
03:44:18,840 --> 03:44:19,740
No more tears.

6624
03:44:20,960 --> 03:44:21,840
No more tears.

6625
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:23,220
Not until I avenge your death.

6626
03:44:23,940 --> 03:44:25,480
Aw, she's too slippery.

6627
03:44:26,440 --> 03:44:28,980
She's like a frog, covered in slime.

6628
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:40,300
I don't think this is the last of her, I feel.

6629
03:44:40,980 --> 03:44:43,300
She feels like a final boss, you know?

6630
03:44:43,440 --> 03:44:43,800
I know, yeah.

6631
03:44:44,320 --> 03:44:47,320
Because if you don't see the death happen, they don't die.

6632
03:44:48,060 --> 03:44:48,840
That's true.

6633
03:44:52,340 --> 03:44:52,740
Who?

6634
03:44:52,740 --> 03:44:55,380
I think we'll see her.

6635
03:44:55,400 --> 03:44:55,520
Who's him?

6636
03:44:56,600 --> 03:44:57,220
Yeah, who's him?

6637
03:44:57,800 --> 03:44:58,620
Guy with the ring?

6638
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:00,740
Look at me.

6639
03:45:01,240 --> 03:45:02,780
Look at me, it's gonna be okay.

6640
03:45:03,480 --> 03:45:04,820
Just keep your eyes on me.

6641
03:45:05,100 --> 03:45:05,500
Help me.

6642
03:45:05,960 --> 03:45:07,520
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debra.

6643
03:45:08,140 --> 03:45:08,940
Debra, look at me.

6644
03:45:09,580 --> 03:45:10,440
We're gonna get through this.

6645
03:45:10,580 --> 03:45:10,820
Him!

6646
03:45:11,040 --> 03:45:12,400
It's the green goblin!

6647
03:45:14,580 --> 03:45:15,880
The green devil!

6648
03:45:16,080 --> 03:45:16,920
The green devil!

6649
03:45:17,460 --> 03:45:17,500
The green devil!

6650
03:45:22,980 --> 03:45:25,160
She really could've told us this.

6651
03:45:25,420 --> 03:45:25,880
I know!

6652
03:45:25,880 --> 03:45:26,460
I feel like.

6653
03:45:26,860 --> 03:45:30,200
What were we supposed to see that we wouldn't believe?

6654
03:45:30,200 --> 03:45:31,160
Yeah!

6655
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:32,960
I didn't know what else to do.

6656
03:45:34,860 --> 03:45:35,880
So I helped him.

6657
03:45:38,220 --> 03:45:40,900
I helped Simmons breach the president's security.

6658
03:45:41,840 --> 03:45:42,680
Oh, Simmons.

6659
03:45:43,140 --> 03:45:44,440
That sounds like Simmons, alright.

6660
03:45:45,120 --> 03:45:46,600
Everybody knows Simmons except me?

6661
03:45:46,780 --> 03:45:48,000
Why the hell would we do all this?

6662
03:45:48,360 --> 03:45:49,960
Well, apparently we do know him.

6663
03:45:50,020 --> 03:45:50,540
Long story.

6664
03:45:56,800 --> 03:46:00,120
We're up against the people who really run this country.

6665
03:46:01,940 --> 03:46:04,480
in a very dangerous game.

6666
03:46:04,920 --> 03:46:07,260
And if you don't play your hand right...

6667
03:46:07,260 --> 03:46:08,280
She's so cool.

6668
03:46:08,460 --> 03:46:08,700
I know.

6669
03:46:08,700 --> 03:46:09,680
She reminds me of a vampire.

6670
03:46:13,740 --> 03:46:15,920
She's like a perpetual smirker.

6671
03:46:16,280 --> 03:46:17,440
She's always got a smirk.

6672
03:46:18,060 --> 03:46:18,440
Yeah.

6673
03:46:19,440 --> 03:46:19,920
Simmons there.

6674
03:46:21,200 --> 03:46:22,680
Hunnigan, you need to be careful.

6675
03:46:22,900 --> 03:46:24,140
I think he's the one who did all that.

6676
03:46:25,580 --> 03:46:27,680
We're just FaceTiming him?

6677
03:46:28,420 --> 03:46:28,900
Simmons.

6678
03:46:29,040 --> 03:46:29,520
Simmons.

6679
03:46:31,120 --> 03:46:33,440
All I can think of is Gene Simmons.

6680
03:46:34,820 --> 03:46:36,280
Gonna give us a workout.

6681
03:46:36,620 --> 03:46:37,840
Oh wow, we actually did.

6682
03:46:38,200 --> 03:46:39,680
That didn't take very long.

6683
03:46:40,400 --> 03:46:41,600
Yeah, that didn't.

6684
03:46:41,720 --> 03:46:42,060
Yeah.

6685
03:46:43,400 --> 03:46:43,720
Yahoo!

6686
03:46:43,960 --> 03:46:45,040
Oh, you got A again.

6687
03:46:45,380 --> 03:46:45,840
Good job.

6688
03:46:46,600 --> 03:46:46,880
Thank you.

6689
03:46:47,260 --> 03:46:49,420
But you got so many more enemies than me.

6690
03:46:51,180 --> 03:46:52,100
Not really.

6691
03:46:54,280 --> 03:46:55,500
And your accuracy.

6692
03:46:55,720 --> 03:46:56,640
Good job, team.

6693
03:46:56,860 --> 03:46:57,400
Good job, team.

6694
03:46:57,420 --> 03:46:58,500
That's just because I use a knife.

6695
03:46:59,440 --> 03:47:01,360
It's only 2% different.

6696
03:47:05,940 --> 03:47:06,840
This is good.

6697
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:08,120
Wait, that's Richard Simmons.

6698
03:47:08,420 --> 03:47:10,000
Wait, Gene Simmons is from Kiss.

6699
03:47:10,600 --> 03:47:12,180
Yeah, that's who I thought you were talking about.

6700
03:47:12,420 --> 03:47:14,820
Oh, I was thinking of Richard Simmons.

6701
03:47:15,200 --> 03:47:16,360
Who's Richard Simmons?

6702
03:47:16,800 --> 03:47:20,400
Richard Simmons is the one who does the 80's workout videos.

6703
03:47:24,320 --> 03:47:28,820
One time I saw Gene Simmons at a convention and I took a picture of him.

6704
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:33,740
And then the people were like, um, you need to pay for that photo, young lady.

6705
03:47:33,740 --> 03:47:34,900
And I was like, oh, I'm sorry.

6706
03:47:34,900 --> 03:47:35,700
I didn't know.

6707
03:47:36,100 --> 03:47:38,080
Did you think he was like a cosplayer?

6708
03:47:40,500 --> 03:47:44,720
He had a sign, you know, that was like, this is Gene Simmons.

6709
03:47:45,100 --> 03:47:46,120
Hi, I'm Gene Simmons.

6710
03:47:46,380 --> 03:47:47,260
I think I've heard that guy.

6711
03:47:47,260 --> 03:47:50,920
Which I guess you shouldn't take pictures without permission, but I didn't know.

6712
03:47:51,980 --> 03:47:52,940
I didn't know.

6713
03:47:53,460 --> 03:47:54,760
A wild Gene Simmons.

6714
03:47:55,200 --> 03:47:55,620
Yeah.

6715
03:48:01,440 --> 03:48:02,700
Do you want to end it here?

6716
03:48:02,860 --> 03:48:04,320
I think this is a good spot to stop.

6717
03:48:04,420 --> 03:48:05,240
Yeah, I think so.

6718
03:48:05,720 --> 03:48:05,800
Yeah.

6719
03:48:06,440 --> 03:48:07,120
There was a timer.

6720
03:48:07,340 --> 03:48:07,960
Can we spend our money though?

6721
03:48:08,000 --> 03:48:09,160
Oh yeah, let's spend our money.

6722
03:48:09,840 --> 03:48:10,220
Yeah.

6723
03:48:11,660 --> 03:48:12,180
Oh, damn.

6724
03:48:12,800 --> 03:48:13,560
I want...

6725
03:48:13,560 --> 03:48:14,800
cash money.

6726
03:48:15,620 --> 03:48:16,760
Oh wait, I can only...

6727
03:48:20,480 --> 03:48:21,320
I still...

6728
03:48:21,320 --> 03:48:22,860
I want more money.

6729
03:48:23,800 --> 03:48:25,720
I think I'll save up for defense.

6730
03:48:26,480 --> 03:48:28,120
I kind of want to save too.

6731
03:48:28,320 --> 03:48:30,240
Maybe I should get defense level one though.

6732
03:48:30,620 --> 03:48:30,700
Oh.

6733
03:48:33,260 --> 03:48:35,040
Defense level two is pricey.

6734
03:48:35,160 --> 03:48:35,280
It does save, right?

6735
03:48:36,320 --> 03:48:37,280
Yeah, it is.

6736
03:48:37,460 --> 03:48:39,620
All the level twos are pricey.

6737
03:48:39,840 --> 03:48:40,040
Yeah.

6738
03:48:45,660 --> 03:48:48,320
I actually had fun with this game.

6739
03:48:49,860 --> 03:48:52,960
People say it's bad, but I feel like it's pretty fun.

6740
03:48:53,320 --> 03:48:53,900
I think it's...

6741
03:48:53,900 --> 03:48:54,560
It's pretty silly.

6742
03:48:54,560 --> 03:48:56,660
Yeah, I think that's why they think it's bad.

6743
03:48:57,020 --> 03:48:58,400
Because they're like...

6744
03:48:58,400 --> 03:48:58,420
Yeah.

6745
03:48:58,480 --> 03:49:01,740
I expect a serious Leon Kennedy and instead we're getting janked.

6746
03:49:02,200 --> 03:49:02,260
Yeah.

6747
03:49:03,860 --> 03:49:04,340
It's...

6748
03:49:04,340 --> 03:49:05,400
It's no like...

6749
03:49:05,400 --> 03:49:09,220
Well, it's not really comparable to Resident Evil 7.

6750
03:49:09,620 --> 03:49:11,480
For what I've played, but...

6751
03:49:11,480 --> 03:49:14,320
I think this is a great introduction though.

6752
03:49:14,660 --> 03:49:18,220
Even though I don't know any of these people or anything that's happening.

6753
03:49:18,220 --> 03:49:18,500
Yeah.

6754
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:20,260
I'm really enjoying myself.

6755
03:49:20,960 --> 03:49:21,140
Yeah.

6756
03:49:21,220 --> 03:49:21,780
You should...

6757
03:49:21,780 --> 03:49:23,080
You should play...

6758
03:49:23,080 --> 03:49:24,560
You should play seven.

6759
03:49:25,340 --> 03:49:27,100
And I should play the others too.

6760
03:49:28,820 --> 03:49:30,820
My friend told me to start at four.

6761
03:49:31,060 --> 03:49:32,140
So I think I'll start this.

6762
03:49:32,240 --> 03:49:32,440
Yeah.

6763
03:49:32,980 --> 03:49:33,160
Hmm.

6764
03:49:33,480 --> 03:49:34,900
That's probably smart.

6765
03:49:34,900 --> 03:49:35,760
Aww.

6766
03:49:40,140 --> 03:49:41,880
But this was so fun!

6767
03:49:42,920 --> 03:49:44,120
This was fun!

6768
03:49:44,860 --> 03:49:45,180
Yeah.

6769
03:49:45,300 --> 03:49:47,040
I'm down to beat this campaign.

6770
03:49:47,400 --> 03:49:47,820
Me too!

6771
03:49:48,020 --> 03:49:48,400
Me too!

6772
03:49:50,040 --> 03:49:52,240
I'm kinda curious how it...

6773
03:49:52,240 --> 03:49:53,300
How it ends.

6774
03:49:53,420 --> 03:49:55,720
If it's only four chapters...

6775
03:49:55,720 --> 03:49:56,520
Wait, I thought it was five.

6776
03:49:56,520 --> 03:49:57,300
No, we're like...

6777
03:49:57,300 --> 03:49:58,860
Oh wait, five chapters.

6778
03:50:02,600 --> 03:50:02,980
Hmm.

6779
03:50:03,340 --> 03:50:03,600
Okay.

6780
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:05,800
Then we will play this again!

6781
03:50:06,520 --> 03:50:07,800
We will return.

6782
03:50:08,100 --> 03:50:08,720
We will return.

6783
03:50:09,140 --> 03:50:10,600
Leon and Helena.

6784
03:50:12,160 --> 03:50:13,260
And Ada.

6785
03:50:13,480 --> 03:50:13,960
And Ada.

6786
03:50:14,000 --> 03:50:15,660
Ada, my beloved.

6787
03:50:15,860 --> 03:50:16,760
Oh, she's...

6788
03:50:17,060 --> 03:50:18,260
Ada the vampire.

6789
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:21,580
She has vampire vibes.

6790
03:50:22,060 --> 03:50:24,620
Do you like Vincent from Final Fantasy?

6791
03:50:25,760 --> 03:50:27,840
Um, I don't know Final Fantasy.

6792
03:50:28,140 --> 03:50:29,760
But I'm sure I would like him.

6793
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:31,100
I think you'd like him.

6794
03:50:31,880 --> 03:50:34,280
Actually, there's a guy named Vamp in Metal Gear.

6795
03:50:35,380 --> 03:50:36,560
Is he a vampire?

6796
03:50:37,060 --> 03:50:38,160
No, he's bisexual.

6797
03:50:44,400 --> 03:50:46,140
Well, you could be both, you know?

6798
03:50:46,620 --> 03:50:48,660
Sometimes the best vampires are.

6799
03:50:51,680 --> 03:50:54,020
No, that's a fact that's brought up in-game.

6800
03:50:58,310 --> 03:50:59,450
I see him.

6801
03:50:59,510 --> 03:51:00,150
I see him.

6802
03:51:00,290 --> 03:51:00,330
I see him.

6803
03:51:00,330 --> 03:51:00,930
I'm Googling.

6804
03:51:01,190 --> 03:51:01,430
Oh!

6805
03:51:03,090 --> 03:51:04,770
He's got a long tongue.

6806
03:51:05,170 --> 03:51:05,810
Yeah, I do.

6807
03:51:06,650 --> 03:51:06,950
Yeah.

6808
03:51:17,650 --> 03:51:19,070
Thank you for playing.

6809
03:51:19,290 --> 03:51:21,730
Everybody subscribe to Min's channel.

6810

6811
03:51:23,810 --> 03:51:25,430
For a surprise, yeah.

6812
03:51:25,910 --> 03:51:26,690
For a surprise.

6813
03:51:28,190 --> 03:51:29,750
Whatever could it be?

6814
03:51:31,250 --> 03:51:32,710
Whatever could it be?

6815
03:51:35,350 --> 03:51:36,870
But yeah, thank you, Timmy.

6816
03:51:37,070 --> 03:51:38,530
Thank you for playing with me.

6817
03:51:38,890 --> 03:51:39,790
This is so fun so far.

6818
03:51:39,790 --> 03:51:40,210
Thank you so much.

6819
03:51:41,170 --> 03:51:42,310
I know, it's pretty fun.

6820
03:51:42,310 --> 03:51:43,130
It's silly.

6821
03:51:43,630 --> 03:51:43,830
Yeah.

6822
03:51:44,750 --> 03:51:48,330
I thought, like, I was like, oh, maybe it'll be kind of like...

6823
03:51:48,330 --> 03:51:50,830
Like, I still wanted to play, but I was like, it was Resident Evil.

6824
03:51:51,170 --> 03:51:53,510
We were kind of like, maybe gonna do a silly horror game.

6825
03:51:53,630 --> 03:51:54,450
But in the end...

6826
03:51:55,210 --> 03:51:57,230
It turned out pretty silly anyway.

6827
03:51:57,350 --> 03:51:58,470
Yeah, it was so great.

6828
03:52:01,090 --> 03:52:03,510
And thank you all for watching and hanging out with us.

6829
03:52:03,510 --> 03:52:03,710

Yes, thank you for watching.

6831
03:52:05,870 --> 03:52:05,990
Yeah.

But I guess I'll see you later.

6839
03:52:25,630 --> 03:52:27,170
Yeah, I'll see you later.

6840
03:52:27,690 --> 03:52:28,290
I wanna...

6841
03:52:28,290 --> 03:52:29,130
Hold on, I wanna make sure...

6842
03:52:29,130 --> 03:52:30,510
If I exit out of this...

6843
03:52:31,230 --> 03:52:31,610
Wait.

6844
03:52:31,610 --> 03:52:32,630
Will we...

6845
03:52:34,370 --> 03:52:35,010
Yeah...

6846
03:52:35,010 --> 03:52:35,590
Escape?

6847
03:52:36,410 --> 03:52:36,730
Oh.

6848
03:52:37,070 --> 03:52:38,470
I'm sure it's saved.

6849
03:52:39,230 --> 03:52:40,130
Probably, right?

6850
03:52:41,890 --> 03:52:42,530
Yes.

6851
03:52:43,130 --> 03:52:45,370
It's just a countdown for one minute.

6852
03:52:47,250 --> 03:52:49,010
It's kind of ominous.

6853
03:52:49,470 --> 03:52:50,830
It is ominous.

6854
03:52:51,710 --> 03:52:52,150
It should...

6855
03:52:52,150 --> 03:52:52,850
Host should save?

6856
03:52:52,970 --> 03:52:53,410
Okay, okay.

6857
03:52:53,730 --> 03:52:55,090
I think we're gonna be good.

6858
03:52:56,390 --> 03:52:57,390
I'm sure it's good.

6859
03:52:57,750 --> 03:52:58,090
Okay.

6860
03:52:58,410 --> 03:52:59,650
Well then, I'll see you later.

6861
03:53:01,750 --> 03:53:02,550
Bye-bye.

6862
03:53:02,850 --> 03:53:03,450
Bye-bye.

6863
03:53:03,810 --> 03:53:04,230
Bye-bye.

6864
03:53:05,670 --> 03:53:07,090
Are you gonna talk to your child?

6865
03:53:08,290 --> 03:53:08,970
Are you?

6866
03:53:09,510 --> 03:53:10,670
I was gonna say hello...

6867
03:53:11,410 --> 03:53:11,730
To them.

6868
03:53:12,030 --> 03:53:13,350
Okay, I'll say hello...

6869
03:53:13,350 --> 03:53:14,070
To them.

6870
03:53:14,590 --> 03:53:14,690
Okay.

6871
03:53:15,730 --> 03:53:16,910
Okay, thank you, Mint.

6872
03:53:17,110 --> 03:53:17,690
Thank you, dude.

6873
03:53:17,850 --> 03:53:18,450
I'll see you later.

6874
03:53:18,770 --> 03:53:19,650
Yeah, I'll see you later.

6875
03:53:20,870 --> 03:53:21,550
Bye-bye.

6876
03:53:21,670 --> 03:53:22,130
Bye-bye.

6877
03:53:22,130 --> 03:53:23,130
Bye-bye.

6878
03:53:27,540 --> 03:53:28,780
When you close out of the...

6879
03:53:28,780 --> 03:53:30,360
Or when you click out of the game...

6880
03:53:30,360 --> 03:53:31,140
It...

6881
03:53:31,140 --> 03:53:32,260
I'm just gonna...

6882
03:53:32,260 --> 03:53:33,000
I'm just gonna quit.

6883
03:53:33,260 --> 03:53:34,380
Once it...

6884
03:53:34,380 --> 03:53:35,400
Once it...

6885
03:53:35,400 --> 03:53:36,200
Counts down.

6886
03:53:38,880 --> 03:53:42,820
What if it's a cutscene, though?

6887
03:53:44,900 --> 03:53:45,660
Oh, no!

6888
03:53:46,720 --> 03:53:49,520
The president spoke highly of you, Agent Kennedy.

6889
03:53:50,220 --> 03:53:51,460
Oh, what do we do?

6890
03:53:51,480 --> 03:53:52,860
I told you we've been friends for 30 years.

6891
03:53:53,460 --> 03:53:54,160
Tell me...

6892
03:53:54,160 --> 03:53:55,100
I should replay, though.

6893
03:53:56,680 --> 03:53:57,060
Right?

6894
03:54:00,740 --> 03:54:01,760
What are you saying?

6895
03:54:02,260 --> 03:54:03,480
Are we just gonna watch it?

6896
03:54:03,760 --> 03:54:04,680
Alt F4.

6897
03:54:04,680 --> 03:54:06,800
You must be aware that you are both...

6898
03:54:07,480 --> 03:54:08,040
Suspects...

6899
03:54:08,680 --> 03:54:09,000
Suspects?

6900
03:54:09,160 --> 03:54:09,280
What?

6901
03:54:09,580 --> 03:54:10,980
Agent Harper...

6902
03:54:10,980 --> 03:54:12,900
I can't believe I said the Green Devil.

6903
03:54:13,520 --> 03:54:14,620
What's wrong with me?

6904
03:54:14,660 --> 03:54:16,140
Leaving the president vulnerable.

6905
03:54:16,940 --> 03:54:17,980
Okay, I'm gonna Alt F4.

6906
03:54:18,320 --> 03:54:19,900
You must admit such behavior is...

6907
03:54:20,520 --> 03:54:21,320
Oh, it disappeared.

6908
03:54:21,600 --> 03:54:22,000
For real.

6909
03:54:23,820 --> 03:54:28,240
I can't believe I called him the Green Devil.

6910
03:54:28,380 --> 03:54:29,380
What's wrong with me?

6911
03:54:31,520 --> 03:54:33,140
It's so embarrassing.

6912
03:54:34,540 --> 03:54:35,660
Nimi disappeared.

6913
03:54:37,440 --> 03:54:38,600
It's just me.

6914
03:54:38,880 --> 03:54:39,340
Oh.

6915
03:54:39,900 --> 03:54:41,160
Yeah, it's just me.

6916
03:54:42,340 --> 03:54:42,880
Oh!

6917
03:54:43,300 --> 03:54:43,900
Why am I gone?

6918
03:54:45,200 --> 03:54:46,100
There we go.

6919
03:54:47,500 --> 03:54:48,920
My arms were tired.

6920
03:54:49,100 --> 03:54:50,100
I wanted to put them up.

6921
03:54:52,260 --> 03:54:54,880
Why are my arms tired?

6922
03:54:59,860 --> 03:55:00,940
Lilac cameo.

6923
03:55:02,740 --> 03:55:04,080
But thank you, guys.

6924
03:55:04,500 --> 03:55:05,200
Thank you, thank you.

6925
03:55:05,240 --> 03:55:06,180
This was so much fun.

6926
03:55:07,080 --> 03:55:07,520
And...

6927
03:55:08,820 --> 03:55:10,120
Yeah, I'm really hungry.

6928
03:55:10,120 --> 03:55:11,740
So I'm actually gonna go eat dinner.

6929
03:55:12,120 --> 03:55:13,460
I'm so, so hungry.

6930
03:55:15,260 --> 03:55:17,960
But I didn't want to say anything because I was having so much fun.

6931
03:55:19,100 --> 03:55:20,280
But thank you all.

6932
03:55:21,040 --> 03:55:23,620
And I'll see you guys when I see you.

6933
03:55:24,520 --> 03:55:24,960
And...

6934
03:55:24,960 --> 03:55:25,100
Yeah!

6935
03:55:29,020 --> 03:55:32,020
I do love when my Oshi does things with my Oshi.

6936
03:55:32,460 --> 03:55:32,940
Yippee!

6937
03:55:33,640 --> 03:55:35,520
I love Nimi Nightmare.

6938
03:55:35,700 --> 03:55:36,440
She's so cute.

6939
03:55:36,660 --> 03:55:38,140
And so fun to hang out with.

6940
03:55:38,380 --> 03:55:39,840
We were such a great team.

6941
03:55:40,400 --> 03:55:42,400
I was really having so much fun with her.

6942
03:55:44,520 --> 03:55:45,000
Akidoki!

6943
03:55:45,320 --> 03:55:46,320
I will see you guys...

6944
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:47,580
Later!

6945
03:55:48,360 --> 03:55:48,760
Later!

6946
03:55:48,920 --> 03:55:49,320
Otsubito!

6947
03:55:49,920 --> 03:55:50,980
Eat the last time!

6948
03:55:51,040 --> 03:55:51,580
Thank you guys!

6949
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:51,860
Sorry.

6950
03:55:52,000 --> 03:55:54,120
I would stay for longer, but I'm so, so hungry.

6951
03:55:55,700 --> 03:55:56,440
I'll see you.

6952
03:55:56,940 --> 03:55:57,600
Bye bye!

6953
03:55:57,600 --> 03:55:57,860
Bye!
