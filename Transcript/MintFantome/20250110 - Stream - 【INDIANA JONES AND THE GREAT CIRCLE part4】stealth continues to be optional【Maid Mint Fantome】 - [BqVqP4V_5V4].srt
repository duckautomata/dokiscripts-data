1
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,450
Howdy, master, princess!

2
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,590
Welcome back, master, princess!

3
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,690
Hello!

4
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,710
Hello, hello, hello!

5
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,450
I sound a little bit better today, I think.

6
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,730
A little bit stuffy.

7
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,950
But not as bad.

8
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,570
I think I'm getting better.

9
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,810
But I feel like I'm in Dimension 5.

10
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,710
I think...

11
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,490
I took a sleep time medicine.

12
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,870
The ones that help you sleep.

13
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,910
I feel like I'm in a different dimension today.

14
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,630
I feel like I'm in...

15
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,890
How did you end up sleeping?

16
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,230
It was funny because I woke up at 1 AM.

17
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,810
And then I was like...

18
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,350
I looked at the clock and I was like...

19
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,910
1 PM!

20
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,290
I slept until 1 PM!

21
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,090
And it was 1 AM.

22
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,830
Oopsie.

23
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,750
Are you okay?

24
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,630
I'm okay!

25
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,950
I'm okay.

26
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,670
Why would you take that before stream?

27
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,650
What was your endgame?

28
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:40,550
What?

29
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,710
The medicine?

30
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,710
It was to sleep!

31
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,730
It was to sleep!

32
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,230
You still haven't finished Indiana Jones?

33
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,130
Okay.

34
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,850
Maybe if you were going to criticize me on not finishing the game yet...

35
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,010
You should not call him Indiana Johns!

36
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,440
This game is long though.

37
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,080
I didn't realize it was so long.

38
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,020
But I'm having fun with it.

39
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,700
Indiana Johns.

40
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
Indiana Jonas.

41
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,680
Sorry.

42
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,010
Get well soon!

43
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,570
Thank you!

44
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,010
Don't stand in the rain like Indy.

45
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,070
Coughing baby.

46
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,590
Are the meds why you ended up kissing paper 13 times?

47
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,890
Look, I will not explain any context.

48
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,650
I don't have to explain anything to you guys.

49
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,550
I don't have to explain it.

50
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,070
For those who don't know, I tweeted about it.

51
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,170
I practiced kissing paper 13 times.

52
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,090
Was anything on the paper?

53
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:16,690
Nope.

54
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,970
I was just practicing.

55
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,190
I was just practicing.

56
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,970
Hi, I'm a piece of paper.

57
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,010
Animator, welcome to membership.

58
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,910
Thank you!

59
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,610
Usually my cough ends up getting really bad at night.

60
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,110
So I'll be like decent-ish all day.

61
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,730
And then at night my cough gets really, really bad.

62
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,310
Hopefully, I'll be okay.

63
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,210
Hmm...

64
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,330
Is it for ASMR purposes?

65
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,110
No?

66
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,850
Look, I don't have to give you guys anything.

67
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,190
I don't have to tell you guys anything.

68
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,110
I can just tweet things.

69
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,990
It's my afterlife.

70
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,630
Let me do what I want!

71
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,050
Let me do what I want.

72
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,870
What if I ask nicely?

73
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,330
No.

74
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,270
Now is the time for me to do the coughing baby.

75
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,670
I don't want to be coughing baby!

76
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,890
I don't want to be coughing baby.

77
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,210
I want to be cool Indiana Jones.

78
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,510
You don't have to, but what if you told us because you like us?

79
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,850
Look, I will be explained in time, okay?

80
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,250
You must be patient.

81
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,070
No!

82
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,230
Giggly E.P.

83
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,250
Vito with cute Mito.

84
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,910
What was I going to say?

85
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,030
Oh, I was going to do a recap of Indiana Jones because it's been a while.

86
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,630
It's been a while since we last played Indiana Jones.

87
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,290
It's been a while.

88
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,990
Can't wait to see you this weekend.

89
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,490
Wait, are you going to a danny party?

90
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,290
I've told them... I don't know.

91
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,630
I was like, singing is kind of...

92
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,930
I'm going to do my best.

93
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,670
Please, I need this.

94
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,870
So, recap.

95
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,490
Should I do a big recap or just a small recap of what happened?

96
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,850
Let's do a big recap because it's been a while.

97
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,510
So, Indiana Jones...

98
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:01,970
He was working at school and a big giant man broke in and stole a little cat mummy.

99
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,830
And he's like, no, my cat mummy.

100
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,110
I love that guy.

101
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
He stole his cat mummy figurine.

102
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,350
And so he had to travel to Italy.

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,430
Why?

104
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,330
Why did he choose Italy?

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,470
Something...

106
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,370
The giant guy had a Vatican thing.

107
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,590
He had a Vatican medal.

108
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,750
Yes!

109
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,350
So he had to go to Italy.

110
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,630
And we were like, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

111
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,150
And we found stuff.

112
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,850
We found a big tomb of giant people.

113
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,590
And I had to punch a giant in the face.

114
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,690
Pretty awesome.

115
00:08:52,690 --> 00:09:03,430
And then we found out that the cat mummy was actually not a cat mummy.

116
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,790
It was actually a thing.

117
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,970
Pinky!

118
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,690
It was a piece of...

119
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,130
Hold on.

120
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:25,030
There are some things that create a great circle.

121
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,530
No, not an infinity stone.

122
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,970
There's something...

123
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,860
And then there were other things.

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,540
Like one was in...

125
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,540
One was in...

126
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,880
Mexico.

127
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,740
No.

128
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,700
Somewhere.

129
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,540
And they also found...

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,860
Egypt was next.

131
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,400
Yes!

132
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,640
That's where we went from.

133
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,340
We went from...

134
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,640
We went from Italy and we went...

135
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
All the way to Egypt.

136
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,280
And then we went sneak, sneak, sneak.

137
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,040
And I also punched more people there.

138
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,580
And...

139
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,620
There was a haunted cave.

140
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,100
But it actually wasn't haunted.

141
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,500
Which was kind of disappointing.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,520
And...

143
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,860
It's raining where I'm at too.

144
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,900
So it's extra immersive.

145
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
The great pyramids of Mexico.

146
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,440
No, I got ahead of myself.

147
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,680
I was thinking about the boat.

148
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,800
But that wasn't Mexico.

149
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,500
I can't remember where they did that experiment.

150
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
I can't remember.

151
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,180
But anyway, hold on, hold on, hold on.

152
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,040
We went to Egypt.

153
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,640
And we...

154
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,540
Found like a really crazy cave thing.

155
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
And it actually had a giant alive...

156
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,660
Oh, well, there was a live giant before.

157
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,160
At the Vatican.

158
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,900
But that guy kind of sucked.

159
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,780
This guy was like really old.

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,660
Probably like so old.

161
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,520
And he didn't like us.

162
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,840
He was just like, hey, don't say that name.

163
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,140
And we were like, what name?

164
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,620
I'm gonna say the name.

165
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,580
And...

166
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,580
And...

167
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,940
Then we got buried in the sand by the bad guy.

168
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,600
And we had to punch...

169
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,940
No, we had to blow away scorpions.

170
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,760
Because apparently they're very aggressive.

171
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,780
Yeah.

172
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,560
And...

173
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,920
We heard where they were going next.

174
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
And they were like, we're going to the Himalayas.

175
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,900
Because there was something else there.

176
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,960
And so we go.

177
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,640
And we see a big ship.

178
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,940
That was like the coolest part of the game so far.

179
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,940
I'm not gonna lie.

180
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,860
We went to find the missing boat that traveled through space and time.

181
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,160
Into the hilltops of the Himalayas.

182
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,260
And it was like, whoa.

183
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,100
And all the people on there were frozen.

184
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,220
And you're like, whoa.

185
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,160
And then I go, sneak, sneak, sneak.

186
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Punch, punch, punch.

187
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,700
Sneak, sneak, sneak.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,140
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

189
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,880
And...

190
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,740
We found the capitan.

191
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,700
Who had a thing that we needed.

192
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,900
And then we say the spell.

193
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,320
Because the boat collapses.

194
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,940
And we say the spell and we're transported to Shanghai.

195
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,220
And we're like, whoa.

196
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,520
I don't have to sneak there.

197
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,780
All I had to do was fly a plane.

198
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,520
And...

199
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,980
From Shanghai, we flew a plane.

200
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,320
And now we're here.

201
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,160
Oh yeah, we found the lady's sister.

202
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,080
Because she was working with the baddies.

203
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,720
Maybe against her will, maybe not.

204
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,020
It's questionable.

205
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,700
Rest in popsicle.

206
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,140
She became a popsicle.

207
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,360
She was frozen.

208
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,220
Howdy, Minto.

209
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,540
Tips cowboy hat.

210
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,460
Glad to see you with less snot.

211
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,780
I have an equal amount of snot, I'd say.

212
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,100
Yeah.

213
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,120
Classic missing sister move.

214
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,860
I sure hope not.

215
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,640
Thanks Minto for the retelling of the past streams of Indiana Jones.

216
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,680
I was really busy when you streamed them.

217
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,240
Oh, no problem.

218
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,360
So, this recap is kind of questionable.

219
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,080
Wait, no!

220
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,280
I hit all the big points, did I not?

221
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,260
I think so.

222
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
Did I miss anything?

223
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,900
You did great.

224
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,940
You did good.

225
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,380
Thanks for the spark notes.

226
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,600
Hi, Minto.

227
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,620
Hello, hello.

228
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,940
Nope, that was all, I think.

229
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,380
You basically got it.

230
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,760
You should describe the one fight scene where the Nazi doctor guy jumps like a monkey.

231
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,120
They're so goofy in this game.

232
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,680
Everybody is so goofy.

233
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,500
I love it.

234
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
What's the great circle?

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,600
If you have the great...

236
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,380
It's...

237
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,200
The great circle.

238
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
The circumference.

239
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,280
With it comes a great responsibility.

240
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,880
And then you say, I missed the part where that's my problem.

241
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,540
Oh, no.

242
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,960
Isn't it like...

243
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,380
Isn't it like a bunch of the wonders of the worlds are placed in a circle?

244
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,880
And you go there and there's...

245
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,300
There's pieces that also make a circle.

246
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,300
And also, then you get great power, probably.

247
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,790
I think she's making this up.

248
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,850
I'm not.

249
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,810
It's an ancient donut.

250
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,730
Fullmetal Alchemist plot.

251
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,890
Is that really the plot of Fullmetal Alchemist?

252
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,550
It's been a long time since I watched that.

253
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,450
I actually never watched Brotherhood either.

254
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,430
You mean the pyramids?

255
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,190
We went to the pyramids.

256
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,190
The pyramids had...

257
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,990
Giants underneath them.

258
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,910
Oh, what are they?

259
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,650
Oh, Iris.

260
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,890
Iris is one of them.

261
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,630
What are they called?

262
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,980
Nephilims.

263
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,900
Nephilim.

264
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,000
Nephilim.

265
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,200
Sounds like something from Winnie the Pooh.

266
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,400
You have heffalumps and nephalims.

267
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,220
You must correct this immediately.

268
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,240
Brotherhood is so good.

269
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,020
I liked when I watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist.

270
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I saw the movie too.

271
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,280
I never saw Brotherhood though.

272
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,020
But Brotherhood is more accurate to the manga, right?

273
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,660
Thank you.

274
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,540
Sorry, I spooked you.

275
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,700
Biblically accurate Winnie the Pooh.

276
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,100
So let's continue.

277
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,060
Oh gosh, you guys.

278
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm gonna have to remember all the controls for this game.

279
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,660
Oh, I forgot too that it's in first person.

280
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,920
Oh my goodness.

281
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,240
Elephant.

282
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,240
Anything around here?

283
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,580
I'm gonna have to remember the controls.

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,660
Oh geez.

285
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,920
Okay, I know how to punch.

286
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,040
This is block.

287
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,200
Oh, that's punch.

288
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,240
That's punch too.

289
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,360
Keralese.

290
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,940
Keralese.

291
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,940
Welcome to membership.

292
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,620
Thank you.

293
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,780
We got jump.

294
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,840
This is block.

295
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
Put them fists away.

296
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,940
Put it away.

297
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,180
Indy.

298
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,460
That's whip.

299
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,780
Crouch.

300
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,380
And I can change outfits and food and everything here.

301
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,820
I know how to put it away.

302
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,720
It's all coming back a little bit.

303
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,620
It's coming back a little bit.

304
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,120
Can I break this?

305
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,820
Break that.

306
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:49,820
Nope.

307
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,220
Wait, am I supposed to be sneaky here?

308
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm just gonna wander on in.

309
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,560
Darksiders 1 is a Legend of Zelda inspired post-apocalyptic game where you play as a Nephilim.

310
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,780
Highly recommend it.

311
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,680
Kinda like DMC Combat.

312
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,740
Thanks for the suggestion.

313
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,460
Let's see.

314
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,840
Comic book.

315
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Albino Crocodile God versus the Reptile King.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,480
That's quite the title.

317
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,700
I collect all the comic books.

318
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,380
I love those.

319
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,040
Am I supposed to be sneaky here you think?

320
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,540
Am I free to just wander?

321
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,740
I can't read.

322
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm gonna wander until someone gets mad at me.

323
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,640
Hello?

324
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:12,800
Hello?

325
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,000
Wow, that's a lot of apples.

326
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,640
Surely they wouldn't mind me taking...

327
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,340
Like this guy is not gonna get mad at me, right?

328
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,460
Hello?

329
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,080
She looks tired.

330
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,630
She's going ghost.

331
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,910
She's going ghost.

332
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,290
What's this?

333
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,310
A recipe.

334
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,510
Tom Yum Goong recipe.

335
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,910
Look at the guy on

336
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:00,820
the...

337
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,580
Kinda looks like you guys.

338
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,080
Interesting.

339
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Serve and watch him squirm.

340
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,140
Excuse me?

341
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,280
That rude German asked for food.

342
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,240
Because I want to watch him burn, we will make my famous Tom Yum Goong.

343
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,800
This is how you do it.

344
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,800
You prepare a batch of shrimp and make stock out of the shells and heads.

345
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:32,800
Strain out the bits and add 3 stalks of lemongrass, 7 lime leaves, a large root worth of ground galangal...

346
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,180
And 20 roughly chopped chilies, including the seeds.

347
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,500
A birthday!

348
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,800
It means that was my birthday today and since my hard drive is too small for MGS5...

349
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,620
Oh, and my hard drive is too small for MGS5 since Mother Base can't sing me happy birthday, would you mind?

350
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,740
Of course, Ben!

351
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,860
Happy birthday, congratulations!

352
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,800
Happy birthday, with salutations!

353
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,360
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue!

354
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,240
Happy birthday to you, Ben!

355
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,160
Happy birthday!

356
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,360
After 5 minutes, add the shrimp and take off the heat.

357
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,020
Add chili paste, fish sauce, and lime juice until it tastes right.

358
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,760
Serve and watch him squirm.

359
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,440
Go to the market and shop this.

360
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,280
Chili paste until it is spicy enough.

361
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,260
Dang.

362
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,360
I think I would...

363
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,900
Why did you say that?

364
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,040
I like spicy.

365
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,200
What if I...

366
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,060
What if I...

367
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,360
Whip her?

368
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Okay.

369
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,860
Is this fish?

370
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,200
It's a lot of fish!

371
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,500
It's a lot of fish.

372
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,620
And he is a man of taste.

373
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,500
That's me when I pick up a doujin.

374
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,520
Mmm, spicy.

375
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,480
I like spicy.

376
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,460
How are you?

377
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,780
You okay?

378
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,880
He's just shuffling along.

379
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,320
Umm...

380
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,040
Okay.

381
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,680
I love exploring in this game.

382
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,480
I know that's probably what makes this take a bajillion times longer for me.

383
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,040
Oh!

384
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,260
Anything for me to steal behind you?

385
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,540
No?

386
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,280
I don't think you're asleep.

387
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,180
Oh, sorry.

388
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,040
Your eyes are open.

389
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,600
I don't think you're asleep at all.

390
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,420
Are you cold?

391
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,920
You're shivering a little bit.

392
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,880
Are you cold?

393
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,560
What the hell was that?

394
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,200
Did you know that a Swiss photographer who traveled to Egypt in 1988 was presented with an 11.8 inch finger?

395
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,940
What?

396
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,470
Yaoi hands are real.

397
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,630
Corn.

398
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,550
Guys, is corn a vegetable?

399
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,430
I did the thing earlier that was like, this is a psychological test.

400
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,110
And it asks you questions like, oh it is?

401
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,890
Okay, thank god.

402
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,630
It was like, what's 1 plus 1?

403
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,850
What's 2 plus 2?

404
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,570
What's 4 plus 4?

405
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,950
What's 8 plus 8?

406
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,290
And obviously I got all of those correct.

407
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,730
And then it said, name the first vegetable that comes to your mind.

408
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,250
And I said corn.

409
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,470
But apparently, most people think of carrots.

410
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,590
Corn is not a vegetable.

411
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,290
Gregor Spory.

412
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,190
Okay, I'll look him up later.

413
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,970
Oh no, you didn't bring your clothes in!

414
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,750
Shame, shame, shame.

415
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,710
It's a kind of vegetable.

416
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,110
I'm getting mixed messages from you guys.

417
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,550
I'm getting mixed signals.

418
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,830
I don't know who to believe.

419
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,350
Oh yeah, we're at the hotel.

420
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,160
Hello.

421
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,480
Hello.

422
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:35,760
Hello.

423
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,020
Oh, news article.

424
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,020
Sukhothai article.

425
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:55,040
The foreign archaeological delegation visiting the ruins of Sukhothai has been marred by accusations of thievery.

426
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,320
It was an internet psychological test.

427
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,580
Oh, Gina's talking to herself again.

428
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,640
I can...

429
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:18,680
Witnesses claim that the soldiers accompanying the archaeological expedition as protection against rebels have been stealing valuable historical artifacts intending to ship them back to Europe.

430
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:31,820
The general of the Royal Siamese Army in the Sawankhalok region dismissed this as baseless rumors.

431
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:45,320
This expedition was sent by Italy's great leader Bonito to exchange knowledge benefiting both our countries, she said.

432
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:59,080
According to the general, the archaeologists will work with local scholars for a few days studying the ruins before they return home.

433
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,620
We should be proud by the global importance of our history, he added.

434
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,200
Voss is that one...

435
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,780
That one guy.

436
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,440
That one...

437
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,800
He's the baddie.

438
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,540
He's the main baddie we're fighting right now.

439
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
Fast hands.

440
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,760
Revolver reload speed has increased.

441
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,800
I got them fast hands.

442
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,560
Yeah, Huey Voss.

443
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:36,600
Right?

444
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,720
Hello.

445
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,640
He's just scratching his chin.

446
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,430
Is anyone looking at me?

447
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,650
Stealing their bread?

448
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,270
Stealing their bread?

449
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,970
Stealing... I'm stealing their food?

450
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,590
No one's looking at me?

451
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:01,810
Oh.

452
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,750
Oh.

453
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,690
Hello.

454
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,550
Hey.

455
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,370
Hey.

456
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,970
Hey.

457
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,780
No one's looking, right?

458
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,200
They're gonna scream if they see I'm taking their food.

459
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,320
Just... hey.

460
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,100
Simple.

461
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,680
Hey.

462
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,820
What is up over here, though?

463
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,720
Anything of interest?

464
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,100
Can I make a phone call?

465
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,680
No.

466
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,640
There's lots to explore around here, okay.

467
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,360
The bread isn't yours.

468
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,640
It is now.

469
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,730
Have fun.

470
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,290
Oh gosh, there's so much to explore in this area.

471
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,670
Okay, that's how you run again.

472
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,090
Yeah, so I'm fine.

473
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,070
I don't need to be a secret around these guys.

474
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,470
Unless I'm stealing their money.

475
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:17,690
Hello.

476
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,250
And he says hi to everyone.

477
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,050
So nice.

478
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,170
That was an American greeting.

479
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,090
Get him!

480
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,430
What's up in here?

481
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,310
I hear Gina still.

482
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,030
Gina, give it a rest.

483
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,150
Okay.

484
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,870
I give up.

485
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,450
Let's go break in, maybe.

486
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,370
Ciao!

487
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,570
Soggy bread.

488
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,990
No, it's not soggy.

489
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,110
Where is she?

490
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,520
Hello.

491
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,700
Hello, ladies.

492
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,960
Oh, she is inside?

493
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,720
Oh my god.

494
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Oh my god.

495
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,730
I'm not eating the stalk.

496
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,770
That's very confusing.

497
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,450
Hi.

498
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,070
Hello.

499
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,210
Tomato is actually a fruit, but considered a vegetable in culinary...

500
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:45,610
This is why things are so difficult.

501
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,690
Yeah.

502
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,410
I hope your sick goes away.

503
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:53,990
Thank you.

504
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:55,730
Okay.

505
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,170
Starfruit?

506
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,650
I love starfruit.

507
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:01,910
Starfruit.

508
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,650
This is...

509
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,590
This is fruit food for everybody, everyone.

510
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:09,690
Probably.

511
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,950
Flood rains hit the Sawankalak region.

512
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,150
Many regions in Siam are grappling with the aftermath of an exceptionally intense monsoon season.

513
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,150
A hot dog is an open-faced sandwich.

514
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,070
We're not having this conversation.

515
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,270
Banana, actually a berry.

516
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,610
No.

517
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,450
It would need to be more juicy.

518
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,530
I would like a room.

519
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:48,550
One region in the province of Sawankalak, known for the ruins of Sukhoktai, where rice fields and villages along its rivers have been inundated.

520
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:55,170
Tourists are advised to stay away from the area, as normal travel routes will be limited or inaccessible for some time.

521
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,810
Monsoon season hit hard.

522
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,970
Let me in.

523
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,990
Oh, we need the storage key, eh?

524
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,690
Alright.

525
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:03,890
Okay.

526
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,390
Next thing you know, B is also a fish, probably.

527
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,790
Hey, can I get this room?

528
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,810
Carrots used to be Resident Evil.

529
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,770
I'm just so shocked, though.

530
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,750
Room key four.

531
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,270
That...

532
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,810
It could be both a fruit...

533
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:32,930
And...

534
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,210
And a vegetable.

535
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,770
That makes no sense.

536
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,010
Are you gonna help us get a room?

537
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,130
They're trying, they're probably just like, get a room.

538
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,950
But how am I supposed to?

539
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,170
Rebel attack.

540
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,550
Oh, sorry, rebel article.

541
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,090
Following a series of violent rebel attacks...

542
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,330
Ow!

543
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,930
I didn't make that up.

544
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:59,730
On the foreign expedition of Sukhothai, the general has vowed to end the bloodshed.

545
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,310
Soldiers will now... I wanted violence.

546
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,590
I thought I made up the violence, but it actually happened.

547
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,550
I'm craving it.

548
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,710
Soldiers will now accompany the expedition to ensure their safety.

549
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:21,870
This should not concern the peaceful residents in the area, said the general when asked about how this would impact the villagers around the Sukhothai ruins.

550
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,470
The soldiers are only there to protect everyone from the senseless violence committed by the rebels.

551
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:33,590
The rebels have been active in Sukhothai since the failed uprising in Krang Thep, which caused many to flee north.

552
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,050
Fight back, people.

553
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,450
Rise up!

554
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,030
The Vatican declared capybaras as fish so Christians could eat them during Lent.

555
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,960
Who is eating capybaras?

556
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,380
What?

557
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,160
Oh.

558
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,500
Okay.

559
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,220
I don't remember what I'm supposed to be doing.

560
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,400
Wait, hold on.

561
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,160
There we go.

562
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,560
Okay.

563
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:21,640
We have this nice pretty little sketch that we did of the hotel.

564
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,140
Trouble in paradise.

565
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,060
Sukhothai, one of the sites on the Great Circle.

566
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,660
There must be a stone hidden somewhere in the ruins.

567
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,420
Marcus Brody has access to all sorts of research back at college that could prove helpful in finding it.

568
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,620
Okay, so we're gonna call him and be like, hey buddy.

569
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,160
Hey Brody.

570
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,840
Brody, Brody.

571
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,520
Brody Mc... Brody.

572
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,200
Oh my god, Gina, give it a shot, please.

573
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,480
Marcus, did you find the page?

574
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,140
Sukhothai.

575
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,020
That's what I thought.

576
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,900
Hey, shut up.

577
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,100
I mean, what's wrong with meeting a person?

578
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,880
What's wrong with talking to a lady?

579
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,740
Oh my god, we're fired.

580
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,840
Wait, actually?

581
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
No way!

582
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,460
They fired Indiana Jones?

583
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,720
Oh my god!

584
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,140
It's him!

585
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,200
It's the big giant.

586
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,540
The first giant.

587
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,160
Hello?

588
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,620
Thank you so much.

589
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,360
Very helpful.

590
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,140
What?

591
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,300
Did nobody...nobody notices this is happening?

592
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,730
VA is so good, right?

593
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,890
Voice acting in this game is awesome.

594
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,190
Oh, he hung...

595
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,210
What happened?

596
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,090
Say it.

597
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:01,910
Say a ghost.

598
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:02,970
Say it!

599
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,670
Well, it took me a while, but I finally got us some rooms.

600
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,470
Oh,

601
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,970
she got us one room.

602
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,390
Take the room key.

603
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,970
What if I don't?

604
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,830
How much will she bother me?

605
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,390
Indiana!

606
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,150
Indiana!

607
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,330
Indiana, take him with his bones!

608
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,750
Indiana Jones!

609
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,410
Oh my goodness!

610
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,890
Indy, no!

611
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,860
Ok, I'm taking it.

612
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,380
Thank you.

613
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,280
Goodbye.

614
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,240
Where did that guy come from?

615
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,700
Where did that guy go?

616
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,560
Where did that guy come from?

617
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,120
Indiana Jones.

618
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,190
He shouldn't be threatening me though.

619
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,590
We are trying to help.

620
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,750
No.

621
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,230
This is my room.

622
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,550
I'll leave my door unlocked.

623
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,050
Actually, no.

624
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,850
I'll leave my door locked.

625
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,630
I got attacked by a giant.

626
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,160
Oh yeah, free bread!

627
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,500
No!

628
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,660
Hold on.

629
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,160
Munch?

630
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,560
Munch?

631
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
Munch.

632
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,520
Nice.

633
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,880
I didn't think this would kill a cutscene.

634
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,020
Wow, the moon is beautiful.

635
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,940
Indy?

636
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,940
Do you hear me, Indy?

637
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,120
It washes everything clean.

638
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
Oh, that's his sister.

639
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,440
We can see the moon so well during monsoon season.

640
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,100
It's kind of crazy.

641
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,050
Mood killer.

642
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,410
Oh my god, I can't believe we got fired.

643
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,350
I was just kidding, but I can't believe we actually fired him.

644
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,150
She?

645
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,810
She?

646
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,430
She?

647
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:34,530
Indy?

648
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,170
Yeah, but that's on you, Indiana Jones.

649
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,990
Oh, she wanted you to be a house husband.

650
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,890
Why is he like...yeah.

651
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:29,710
What is this atmosphere?

652
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
You do have a heart.

653
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,960
But you are still a grave robber.

654
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,740
Indiana Jones.

655
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:52,640
No!

656
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,230
Oh god, Indy.

657
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,810
We just got this room.

658
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,050
Oh my god, the monkeys are going crazy.

659
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,010
Wait, let me in!

660
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:20,630
Gina!

661
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,790
Gina?

662
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,730
Damn, she's fast.

663
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,810
She already ate the apple.

664
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,210
God, she's fast.

665
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,350
Ok, hold on.

666
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,750
I forgot to pick this up earlier.

667
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,230
Forgotten page of a journal.

668
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:50,750
I've arrived at the hotel, far from the busy halls of Chulalongkorn University.

669
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:58,070
I can feel the serenity of Sukhothai settling on me, even though I've only been here a short while.

670
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,390
I needed this change of scenery, just as I need to work in the field.

671
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,950
As much as I love old books, I have to uncover the truth myself.

672
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,950
Is grave robber like cradle robber, but for ghosts?

673
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,510
What's a cradle robber?

674
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,690
Aptly named since you forgot to take it.

675
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,940
Spawn camper?

676
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,540
What?

677
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,780
Baby Minky.

678
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,380
What do you mean?

679
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,220
Don't worry about it.

680
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,240
Nevermind, don't worry about it.

681
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,860
Huh?

682
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,720
I'm scared.

683
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,420
What?

684
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,320
Not for YouTube streams.

685
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,600
You are a ghost.

686
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,480
Just don't Google it.

687
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,880
Some people are saying Google it.

688
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,340
Don't worry about it.

689
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,800
Ok, I'm gonna not worry about it.

690
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,880
Wait, what is it?

691
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,800
I'm scared though.

692
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:18,760
Anyway.

693
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:28,820
I have to uncover the truth myself, following in the footsteps of Prince Vajiravood, as he explored the ruins of Sokotai.

694
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:39,140
Even though I grew up here, it wasn't until I read the story of an excursion to the cities of King's Ruang that I appreciated how much of our history remains to be discovered.

695
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm gonna Google it right now.

696
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,260
Cradle robber.

697
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,860
Google dictionary is just like, cradle robber.

698
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,000
Derogatory.

699
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,220
It's not that bad.

700
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:31,540
It says a person who marries or has a sexual relationship with a much younger person.

701
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,340
So it's like a cougar.

702
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,500
Or...

703
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,020
What's the other one?

704
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,520
What's the reverse?

705
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,500
Silver fox?

706
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,280
No, that's what you describe an old man.

707
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:00,460
Right?

708
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,660
I don't remember what the other is.

709
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,460
It's Matara.

710
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,140
No, Matara likes older men.

711
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,060
Everybody knows that.

712
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:27,440
I found a wonderful photograph taken by Prince Vajiravood in the university library.

713
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,680
Perhaps it is from when he was preparing to embark on his journey into the ruins of Sukhothai on January 4th, 1907.

714
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,980
January 4th?

715
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,600
That was just a couple days ago.

716
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,320
Is Minky a cougar?

717
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,020
No!

718
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,060
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a wolf.

719
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,540
I wonder how much his studies at Oxford inspired him to do this.

720
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,260
Tomorrow I shall make the river journey to the village.

721
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,260
I've brought gifts for Uncle Sunan and fried egg.

722
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,540
Is fried egg a person or...

723
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,880
Is that the gift?

724
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,140
It feels good to be back.

725
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,300
I wonder if the old tree house is still there.

726
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,400
Uncle fried egg.

727
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:18,660
Uncle fried egg.

728
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:25,280
I wonder if the old tree house is still there.

729
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,000
Perhaps I could use it as a base for my field work.

730
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,160
Oh, are we gonna be searching for that?

731
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,720
For the tree house, I wonder.

732
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,740
Are you talking about...

733
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,560
An attack!

734
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,300
We can?

735
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,660
I

736
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,900
can't hear anything!

737
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,160
It's so loud.

738
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,040
How did they get me?

739
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,080
What's this?

740
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,940
Give me my bread!

741
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,620
How do I switch the gun?

742
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,760
Where are they?

743
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,460
I don't see where they are!

744
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,160
Why do you sound like you're inside?

745
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,020
Oh my God, hello.

746
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,060
Hello.

747
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,060
They're invisible!

748
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,200
The enemy are ghosts!

749
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,680
Oh

750
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,860
my God!

751
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,280
I think that's how they got me before.

752
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,720
OK

753
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,260
Hide!

754
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:44,560
Hide!

755
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:44,780
Hide!

756
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,560
Not a key?

757
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,180
No?

758
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,380
Storage key!

759
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,380
Don't go!

760
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,220
Oh my God!

761
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,160
I'm trying!

762
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,840
Oh, there are a lot of keys!

763
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:56,900
Key!

764
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,240
Key!

765
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,040
Key!

766
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:58,580
Key!

767
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,380
Oh my God, which key is it?

768
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,940
Wait, this is so awesome.

769
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,880
This is so funny.

770
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,180
Key?

771
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,140
Key?

772
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:09,920
Key!

773
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,000
This is so good!

774
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,280
Oh, I am?

775
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,460
Oh, there they are.

776
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,080
I'm covering you, Gina!

777
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,680
I don't know where they are.

778
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,480
I can't see anything.

779
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,500
It's too dark.

780
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,780
OK, let's go!

781
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:48,330
OK, open!

782
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,270
No, put it away!

783
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,450
Put it away!

784
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:52,030
Open!

785
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,370
I'm trying to open it!

786
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,540
There are too many keys, Gina!

787
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,780
I can't find the damn key!

788
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,140
Where are we going?

789
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,340
This way?

790
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,840
I'm running.

791
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,980
Why are they still attacking us anyway?

792
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,420
Oh my God!

793
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,980
Where did my friends go?

794
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,680
I'm lost!

795
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,320
Amiki is lost!

796
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,460
Friends!

797
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,240
Gina, how fast are...oh there they are.

798
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,180
There are my friends.

799
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,360
Everything is fine, baby!

800
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,520
I need an adult!

801
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,080
We should have known she was bad news from her eyepatch.

802
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,900
We can match though.

803
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,960
Now I'm bad news.

804
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,220
What's the difference between an archaeologist and a grave robber again?

805
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,540
The museum!

806
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:22,800
Museum!

807
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,140
Maybe.

808
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,320
Unfortunately.

809
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,260
Our boat is kind of loud though.

810
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,370
I am Pailin Chalat Phukalung.

811
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,010
Who are you?

812
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,310
My name is Ginetta Lombardi.

813
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,270
That sounds like...that is so much to write every time!

814
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,150
Goodness gracious!

815
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,790
I'm an archaeologist.

816
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:21,870
Another one.

817
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,450
I'm not like Voss.

818
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,310
But I know what he wants.

819
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,930
And I know how to stop him from getting it.

820
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:32,310
We're gonna kill him!

821
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,690
I will stop him!

822
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:08,010
One of them was sighted last night in their village.

823
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,970
What do you want me to do?

824
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,890
Save them!

825
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,250
Save them!

826
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,410
What if we accidentally hit Sunan though?

827
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,570
If I start blasting.

828
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,260
Oh my god!

829
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,200
Tickle their feet.

830
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,300
Maybe give like...

831
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,760
Maybe give like a few more minutes.

832
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,780
For them to actually walk away, you know?

833
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,320
Stop yelling!

834
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,520
Oh my god, stop yelling please.

835
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,660
That guy on the bridge is like...

836
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,820
What's going on down there?

837
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,070
These guys are on our side, right?

838
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:18,070
I'm sure there are a lot of witnesses here.

839
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,930
Hello!

840
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:30,970
Save them!

841
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,330
Would you like some tea?

842
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:50,230
Yeah!

843
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:54,130
Yeah, me too.

844
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:01,390
Okay.

845
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,350
Okay.

846
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,250
What if I go swimming?

847
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,590
I'll find you.

848
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,310
Yeah, literally.

849
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,150
What do I have to do anyway?

850
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,350
What do I have to do?

851
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,710
Why are you being so suspicious, Indy?

852
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:25,980
Cute!

853
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
Friendly cat.

854
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,000
As opposed to unfriendly cat.

855
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,760
Oh wow, we have the whole village we can go through.

856
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,000
Go to Sunan's hut.

857
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,180
Is that the hut?

858
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,060
Right there, I believe.

859
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,440
Okay, now we get to ransack the place.

860
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,820
Maybe I am just a grave robber.

861
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,380
Hello!

862
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,680
Okay, bye.

863
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,560
He's a traitor and a liar!

864
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,880
It implies that there is an enemy cat.

865
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,100
Nice view, huh?

866
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,820
What are you pondering here?

867
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,160
He seems to got a lot.

868
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,360
He's got a lot on his plate.

869
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:20,680
I think.

870
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,300
We'll leave him be.

871
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,820
Wow, someone's bed.

872
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,540
I'm gonna stomp all over it with my dirty feet.

873
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,720
I'm a menace to society.

874
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,580
Indiana Jones has no morals.

875
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:35,380
Maybe.

876
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,000
Rude!

877
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:41,660
Hello!

878
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,460
Good evening.

879
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,280
I think she's into me!

880
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:51,420
Maybe.

881
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,300
Are you getting sleepy?

882
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,840
Am I hypnotizing her?

883
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,580
What's happening?

884
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,620
She's amused.

885
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,360
We're not amused.

886
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,540
She's winning the staring contest.

887
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,080
Oh!

888
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,110
There's something not right here.

889
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,330
There's something not right in this town.

890
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:47,830
Oh, Jesus.

891
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,010
There's something not right going on here.

892
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,940
Oh, goodness.

893
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,840
You got anything for me to take?

894
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:08,980
No?

895
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:09,980
That's okay.

896
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,280
I'll find something.

897
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,020
I'll find something worth taking.

898
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,680
Bro, we work at 24-7.

899
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,480
I only have actual tears.

900
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,220
Oh, goodness.

901
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,200
Okay, I don't think there's much around here, is there?

902
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,440
I thought maybe like a...

903
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,280
Oh, maybe in here.

904
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,280
I was gonna say like maybe a...

905
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,800
Some sort of journal paper or something.

906
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,840
No?

907
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:42,680
Nothing?

908
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,540
Bethesda chasing game.

909
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,280
I had to refund due to crashing issues.

910
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,000
So here's part of what I would have paid for it.

911
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:55,340
No!

912
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,980
Wait, no, that sucks so much.

913
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,780
Wait, did you have it on PC or on Xbox?

914
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,120
Or is it...

915
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,220
Oh, gosh, where did that guy come from?

916
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,020
Is there anything other than Xbox?

917
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,800
I think I saw someone.

918
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:19,480
Fall?

919
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:19,860
No?

920
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,240
Nobody says hi to me in here.

921
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,640
You can't really explore this area until the morning.

922
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,060
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

923
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,380
We'll just go to the hut then.

924
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:37,790
Turn hut.

925
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,250
It's this one, right?

926
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:40,930
Over here?

927
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,350
Not this one.

928
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:47,730
Oh.

929
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:49,710
Nope, wrong family.

930
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,500
See, this is how you properly sleep.

931
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,840
So they can't properly sleep.

932
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,080
It's just everyone else is messed up.

933
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,160
Okay.

934
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,260
I want some tea.

935
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,120
Upright?

936
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,460
Well, with your eyes closed.

937
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,920
One question, Dr. Jones.

938
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,540
Yes?

939
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,040
What makes you any different from Boss?

940
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,480
I'm sexier.

941
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,320
You are both here to steal our cultural heritage.

942
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,780
No, I'm not here to steal anything.

943
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,500
But...

944
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,160
To ask for your permission.

945
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,740
I have the greatest respect for your culture and its history.

946
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,660
I even teach a course about the Siamese kingdom and its artifacts.

947
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:43,820
Well, you did.

948
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:46,780
This relic we're looking for has great power.

949
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,460
But to Boss, it is a weapon of war.

950
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,760
What?

951
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,080
He will do anything to get it.

952
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,220
He's not a traitor though.

953
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,820
He's just a liar and a killer.

954
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,520
Am I blocking the subtitles at all anyway?

955
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,560
A catch, eh?

956
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,580
The jar of terror!

957
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,600
It's the thing you hate and fear the most.

958
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,760
You have to put your hand in the jar and pull it out.

959
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,920
Face it with what you fear.

960
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,300
What?

961
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,420
A test of bravery.

962
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,900
The jar is cursed with magic.

963
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,040
You must prove yourself, Dr. Jones.

964
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,360
I can hear it slithering in there.

965
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,370
I can hear it.

966
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,180
Why does it always have to be snakes?

967
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,700
His face.

968
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,000
It's a worm!

969
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,200
It's pork intestines.

970
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,860
I thought it was a worm.

971
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,940
And he is not having it.

972
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,120
He's like, I'm going to murder these people.

973
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,860
Get pranked!

974
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,200
Where are the subtitles?

975
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:48,420
Huh?

976
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,880
Ok, ok.

977
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:52,960
We get instant translation.

978
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,220
Ok.

979
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,720
Clams!

980
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,780
Of clams.

981
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,300
The great clam.

982
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,880
From the clam.

983
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,280
The yeek?

984
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,160
What's a yak?

985
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,020
Oh, yak.

986
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:27,980
Yak!

987
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,860
Nice to meet you.

988
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,860
Everywhere is giants!

989
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,180
Yak!

990
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,680
Playing a prank on Indy proves that he can be humble.

991
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,180
A guy who can't laugh at himself can't be trusted.

992
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,260
Yak!

993
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,500
It struck me over the head.

994
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,300
I woke up in a secret temple.

995
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,580
The yak spoke to me in the old voice, in ancient language.

996
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,860
I begged the yak to see the blessed pearl.

997
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,500
The yak took pity on me.

998
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:32,280
It uncovered a chest shaped like a giant clam.

999
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,480
No way!

1000
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,000
It really is the clam!

1001
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,660
The great clam!

1002
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:39,980
There was a pearl.

1003
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,340
You said you know everything about our culture and history.

1004
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,840
Why don't you tell us what the giant revealed to Lungsunan?

1005
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,480
Hidden inside the chest was the blessed pearl.

1006
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,360
I think anybody could have deduced that.

1007
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,360
Carved in it was a word in a language so old no one could read it.

1008
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,300
My guess is...

1009
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,360
The blessed pearl...

1010
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,700
looked something like this.

1011
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,620
Wouldn't the pearl be round?

1012
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,210
Take the small gears.

1013
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:28,410
You'll understand.

1014
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,090
The game doesn't tell you, but take the small gears.

1015
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,610
Ok, I will.

1016
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:32,350
Thank you.

1017
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,090
Secret tunnel.

1018
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,570
The music.

1019
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,530
How's the audio by the way?

1020
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,130
Secret tunnel baby!

1021
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,630
It's good.

1022
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,030
Thank you guys.

1023
01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:02,830
Sorry, I know it's a little bit late to ask.

1024
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,710
Lungsunan trusts you, Dr. Jones.

1025
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,590
So please, don't let him down.

1026
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,330
I will arrange a boat for you.

1027
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,430
But you will also need a breathing device to go through the tunnel.

1028
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:18,410
Pay a visit to Tong Dang in the morning and he will assist you.

1029
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:26,760
And he's got that creepy smile.

1030
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,760
Muted the whole time.

1031
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,720
Good morning, Mito!

1032
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:43,770
I have to go get some medicine.

1033
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,230
Some cough medicine.

1034
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,710
Oh, a friendly cat!

1035
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,410
No, I'm evil kitty.

1036
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:07,350
What a cute kitty, I exclaimed as I pet the kitty.

1037
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:09,930
No, I'm evil kitty.

1038
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:11,370
Oh, let's get our map.

1039
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,510
Map of the flooded ruins.

1040
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:18,250
Oh, so glad that someone mapped that out for us.

1041
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:18,870
Perfect.

1042
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,870
Alright, so we're gonna go meet this guy.

1043
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:24,570
Oh, no, we're going to join Gina.

1044
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:27,950
All the way over there.

1045
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:31,750
Can you sing the secret tunnel song?

1046
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,650
It's from Avatar.

1047
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:35,170
What,

1048
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,850
like the last airbender avatar?

1049
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:46,850
Sorry, I'm ruining your fishing.

1050
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,770
Stop, stop, stop.

1051
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,490
This is one way to meet with Gina.

1052
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,250
Not the blue people avatar.

1053
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,510
She changed!

1054
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,170
I don't know the secret tunnel song.

1055
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,890
If I had to guess how it went...

1056
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:18,650
I would guess this.

1057
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,170
Secret tunnel!

1058
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:26,270
Wow, wow.

1059
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,490
Where are your secrets?

1060
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,510
And where do you go?

1061
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,950
Secret tunnel!

1062
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,550
Where are you now?

1063
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,450
You're hidden below.

1064
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:43,270
And you're so secret!

1065
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,510
4Kids version?

1066
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,210
Was it more raunchy?

1067
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,610
Secret tunnel!

1068
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:00,070
I hope you lead to boobs.

1069
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:05,950
This isn't the 4Kids version, because it talks about boobs.

1070
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:07,950
Secret tunnel!

1071
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,790
Oh, I thought she was jamming on the guitar.

1072
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,550
Ah, you got a gun.

1073
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:17,690
I thought you were going to play to accompany my song.

1074
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,290
My boat is ready?

1075
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,700
Sorry.

1076
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,640
Ok, the gun tour.

1077
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:33,740
Hey Gina.

1078
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,120
Do we have to go by boat?

1079
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,940
Beautiful day for a walk, don't you think?

1080
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,780
If you want to go for a walk, be my guest.

1081
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,160
I'll be in the boat.

1082
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,660
I'll be in the boat.

1083
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:47,960
Ok.

1084
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,180
I guess we're going.

1085
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,560
Wait, what about...Wait, we didn't talk to the doctor.

1086
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,680
Or the...I said doctor.

1087
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,440
The guy that she said to get the breathing device.

1088
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,020
Is she ok?

1089
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,080
Maybe she...Oh the cat!

1090
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,040
Sudden meow.

1091
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,200
Gina.

1092
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,380
Gina.

1093
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,520
Oh, she's wearing a white top though.

1094
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,460
Is she ok?

1095
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,440
You could say it's even a nice boat.

1096
01:11:55,020 --> 01:12:02,260
Take it easy.

1097
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,720
Wait, what about...Hold on.

1098
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,260
You good?

1099
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:28,210
He missed the part where it's his problem.

1100
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,150
You ok?

1101
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:34,250
You're sweating girl.

1102
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:35,750
You're sweating.

1103
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,230
Hold on, I'm gonna...Oh, never mind.

1104
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:39,870
Speak to Tong Tong.

1105
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:40,230
Ok.

1106
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,950
Alright, you're in perfectly safe hands, Gina.

1107
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,110
She's like...Wait, where...Hold on.

1108
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:49,150
You're in perfectly safe hands.

1109
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,250
Gosh, this no person won't shut up about their teacher.

1110
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:55,250
Hold on.

1111
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,210
Oops, wrong button.

1112
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:00,610
Where are they?

1113
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,490
I think they're on the other side.

1114
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:09,910
Oh,

1115
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,470
he's right over there.

1116
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,090
Ok, let's go.

1117
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:22,700
Hello?

1118
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,760
Are you the person I need to talk to?

1119
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,120
Where is he?

1120
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,100
Oh, over there.

1121
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,560
Ok, you just chill right there, Gina.

1122
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,320
Ok?

1123
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,440
Might be easier if I walk.

1124
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,840
Like she initially wanted.

1125
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,680
You have the best what?

1126
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,000
He's got the...

1127
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:55,900
Grain.

1128
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,040
He's got the best grain.

1129
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,320
Why doesn't this connect?

1130
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:07,260
Ok.

1131
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,020
We might have to break into his house from under the house.

1132
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,410
Ok, Gina.

1133
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,330
How do we get in?

1134
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,670
Gina, I think we're stuck.

1135
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:30,590
Gina?

1136
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:32,970
Gina, don't be alarmed.

1137
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:35,550
But...

1138
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,300
Ok, good.

1139
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,480
I didn't flip the boat.

1140
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,200
I was a little concerned for a second.

1141
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,800
I'm working on it!

1142
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,160
Today you're gonna learn how to slim, Gina.

1143
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,980
Maybe I got...oh wait.

1144
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,780
How do I get over there?

1145
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,280
Ok, let's try from out here.

1146
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,380
Little fish!

1147
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,000
Oh, he's over there?

1148
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:28,880
Ok.

1149
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,560
We're gonna go find him.

1150
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,280
He's not in here, is he?

1151
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,160
Nope, ok, he's that way.

1152
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,620
We're gonna find him, no worries.

1153
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:47,120
I thought he was like in the village.

1154
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,390
Is he in here?

1155
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,070
Nope.

1156
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,930
This looks like the entrance to a secret tunnel.

1157
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:58,470
If I had to guess.

1158
01:15:59,090 --> 01:15:59,770
Oh, he's in here!

1159
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:05,980
Ok.

1160
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:10,700
He's

1161
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:16,700
got books.

1162
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:20,140
Yes.

1163
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,080
Oh, how do I take photos again?

1164
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,240
No!

1165
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,800
I want to take a photo!

1166
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:30,360
Tong Dang!

1167
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:36,300
Look at his anime hair.

1168
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,160
It's like sticking out.

1169
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,460
Like anime.

1170
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,040
Get a croc cap.

1171
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:47,700
I wish.

1172
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,560
Ok, it better be.

1173
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,760
How much?

1174
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,300
How much are we saying?

1175
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,260
How much are we saying?

1176
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,020
Say cheese!

1177
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,020
Actually, we have some books that I haven't...

1178
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:15,080
Let's see.

1179
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:15,720
Fast Hands.

1180
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,740
Let's unlock that.

1181
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,080
Hello, Minto.

1182
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:18,640
Hello!

1183
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,040
Exploration.

1184
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,380
That's just whatever stuff.

1185
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,400
A guidebook to medicine.

1186
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,100
Blah, blah, blah.

1187
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:37,270
798!

1188
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,230
I only have 213.

1189
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,640
Give me all your money!

1190
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,700
This is a stick up!

1191
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,240
This is a stick up Tong Dang!

1192
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,760
Tong Dang!

1193
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,560
I'm not playing.

1194
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,060
I'm not playing anymore.

1195
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,860
Tong Dang, give me all your money!

1196
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,460
And the breathing device.

1197
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,060
He smiles in the face of adversity.

1198
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,320
Oh my god!

1199
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,320
How am I supposed to get that kind of money?

1200
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,700
I see.

1201
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,460
All the way over there.

1202
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,740
Are you kidding me?

1203
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,520
Why can't I rob Tong Dang?

1204
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,300
That guy is literally...

1205
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,400
That guy is scamming us.

1206
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,400
I'm missing.

1207
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,120
What's that?

1208
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,560
The tree house!

1209
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:53,720
Oh.

1210
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,720
The kid who vanished.

1211
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:56,680
Interesting.

1212
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:03,800
This game takes place two years prior to Siam renamed to Thailand.

1213
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,680
Also nice friendly price at negative 300% discount.

1214
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,600
Man!

1215
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,820
Wait, I'm guessing the red areas are bad zones, right?

1216
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,360
Where we have to be sneaky, huh?

1217
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,360
Probably.

1218
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,700
Got my dill...

1219
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,380
Pickle, right?

1220
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,520
Pickle pizza?

1221
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,940
Wait, what?

1222
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,300
I'm gonna follow the map.

1223
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,300
I'm gonna follow the map.

1224
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,800
You think there's anything in there?

1225
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,280
No, probably not.

1226
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,720
Chicken and dill pickle.

1227
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:00,880
What?

1228
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,720
I've never heard of that before ever.

1229
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,180
I just found out my dumbass somehow managed to make the dudes less at our university.

1230
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,360
Are you proud of me, Mitsama?

1231
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,460
So glad I switched my major to Japanese.

1232
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,520
You are truly Japanese good!

1233
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,560
Congratulations!

1234
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,400
I see no dumbass.

1235
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,540
What's that sparkling?

1236
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,820
Is it in the spooky zone?

1237
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:29,080
No.

1238
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:30,780
Maybe?

1239
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,200
No.

1240
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:35,880
What is this?

1241
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,460
Sparkle, sparkle.

1242
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,040
Sorry.

1243
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,480
I'm docking, I'm docking.

1244
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,260
Looks like a fast travel.

1245
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:52,740
Nice.

1246
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:53,980
Village.

1247
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,900
What's in here?

1248
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,380
No, no, no.

1249
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:03,860
No, no, no.

1250
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,240
What do you mean see you soon?

1251
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,480
You're coming with, right?

1252
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:07,600
What's this?

1253
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,600
Boat is docked.

1254
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,020
Who did I tell that to?

1255
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,540
Don't look away.

1256
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:29,310
Oh, it's if you can call a boat.

1257
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:30,330
What?

1258
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,250
That's so cool.

1259
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,730
Alright, onwards.

1260
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,670
Sorry, wrong button.

1261
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,470
We go around this little island and it's right on the other side.

1262
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:45,070
Okey dokey.

1263
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,110
Oh, sorry.

1264
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:49,710
I'm not.

1265
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,030
There is an invisible wall.

1266
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,690
I don't know what I'm hitting.

1267
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:54,190
Truly.

1268
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:06,050
Maybe I park right here.

1269
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:17,490
Park right here.

1270
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:17,570
There.

1271
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:21,510
Alright.

1272
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,850
Am I on the right spot?

1273
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,250
Close enough, maybe.

1274
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:33,950
I think I'm on the right spot.

1275
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:35,670
Okey, the game just saved.

1276
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:36,990
Alright, bye Gina.

1277
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:47,130
I just have to cross right over here.

1278
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:50,090
It's not being monitored, is it?

1279
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:56,930
Hmm.

1280
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,010
Alright guys.

1281
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,870
Time to remember how to fight.

1282
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:06,950
I

1283
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,480
don't see any guys.

1284
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,780
Oh, I see guys!

1285
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,520
But they don't see me.

1286
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,240
And I see their money.

1287
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,580
I'm taking all their money.

1288
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:28,240
And I'm taking that.

1289
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:33,910
Alright.

1290
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,250
We got to get a lot of money, don't we?

1291
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:38,330
Oh gosh, you guys.

1292
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:39,830
I think I might...

1293
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:45,670
That tie on the tent says get lost.

1294
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,090
Thank you for translating.

1295
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,670
I was curious about it too.

1296
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,710
Oh, there is a couple guys.

1297
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:54,730
That one too?

1298
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:55,250
Maybe?

1299
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:56,550
It says get lost.

1300
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:59,170
I don't think they are wanted.

1301
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,620
Oh, hello.

1302
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,200
Vos' camp entrance.

1303
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:22,510
I learned as well that the character Kokoro is pronounced minus tone.

1304
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:24,310
Exactly the same as it is in Mandarin.

1305
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:27,010
When read in Onyomi.

1306
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,010
Like sheen?

1307
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,530
Kitties, welcome to membership to Angu.

1308
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:35,210
Oh gosh, you guys.

1309
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,510
I think we have to take out the whole camp.

1310
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:38,530
I'm not going to lie.

1311
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:42,590
Do you think we could recruit those guys over there?

1312
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,760
I'm in restricted area.

1313
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,180
I'm scared.

1314
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,600
What is behind this?

1315
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,620
That guy is just chilling.

1316
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,640
There is another guy there too.

1317
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,720
I'm sneaky.

1318
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,780
Stealth is a mere suggestion.

1319
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,060
I don't know.

1320
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,880
I don't know a good way to get in.

1321
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,120
Maybe I shouldn't have gone through the front door.

1322
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,620
Maybe going through the front door...

1323
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,680
was a bad idea.

1324
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,660
The game doesn't tell you, but there are radio towers that spawn stronger reinforcements if you don't break them.

1325
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,280
The Sukhothai part is really annoying.

1326
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,920
Oh, really?

1327
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,620
Thank you.

1328
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,080
You think I can shoot this guy?

1329
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,920
What if I take them down with my...

1330
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,480
gun?

1331
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,420
He is looking literally right at me.

1332
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,980
How do you survive that?

1333
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,940
Run Endy!

1334
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:32,640
Swim!

1335
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,360
Swim Endy!

1336
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,380
Dummies!

1337
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,720
You can't find me!

1338
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,220
I need to heal.

1339
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,300
Bandage.

1340
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,760
Use.

1341
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:58,960
Like, immediately.

1342
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,020
Is that a dog?

1343
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:12,780
They

1344
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,680
are like,

1345
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,480
we don't care anymore.

1346
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,520
Oh my god, there are so many guys.

1347
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:38,080
There are so many guys!

1348
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:49,280
Oh my god, there are so many guys!

1349
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:53,420
Holy shit!

1350
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,380
There was no way I could have done it you guys.

1351
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,320
There was no way.

1352
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,540
Oh my gosh, there were so many men.

1353
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,340
Oh my god!

1354
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:08,780
How do I want to do this?

1355
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:12,020
Oh my god, there were so many guys.

1356
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,340
This is gonna suck so bad.

1357
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,220
You could have taken them.

1358
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,820
We take hits a lot harder now, I noticed too.

1359
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:36,420
They don't... It's like... I can't take the old one-two anymore.

1360
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,860
I'm like one, one and a half.

1361
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,860
Okay, let's go find another way in.

1362
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,640
I'm leaving.

1363
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,640
Why can't the guy just be... Why can't the guy give me a discount?

1364
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,740
Wait, so are these... Oh, I think they are bad guys.

1365
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,120
I think they are bad guys.

1366
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:02,380
Okay.

1367
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:06,680
Let's find another way in.

1368
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:10,000
Gina, do you want to like... help?

1369
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,460
I could use a second pair of hands.

1370
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:18,900
Hello.

1371
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,700
Oh, my boat is still running.

1372
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:23,440
That's not good.

1373
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,280
I'm gonna run out of... I'm gonna run out of everything.

1374
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,800
What is she gonna do?

1375
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:30,600
I don't know.

1376
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,360
Seduce them.

1377
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:41,450
Is this a dock?

1378
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:45,860
Sorry.

1379
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:49,520
I can't get close to it though.

1380
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,100
It looks like a dock, but... Sorry.

1381
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,620
Gina, I don't know where to go.

1382
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,080
Okay, I'm just gonna go right here then.

1383
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:11,600
Um...

1384
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:17,560
Let's try... We can't go to the left side.

1385
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,960
Let's try the right side.

1386
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,590
We are sneaky.

1387
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,330
We are sneaking around.

1388
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:39,410
Okay.

1389
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:45,730
Why are you judging me?

1390
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:56,790
Why is he judging where I'm going?

1391
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:57,890
Why I'm swimming or not?

1392
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:58,910
Where is she?

1393
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:00,430
Did she follow me?

1394
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,600
I hear them.

1395
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,460
I'm scared, you guys.

1396
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,280
I'm scared.

1397
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,980
There are so many guys.

1398
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,530
I'm just like you.

1399
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,070
I also whistle.

1400
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:54,620
Maybe we can find any pennies that they dropped in between the things, you know?

1401
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,920
What are these like tigers?

1402
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,040
What do they mean?

1403
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:21,350
I'm scoping out the place right now.

1404
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:23,630
Currently I'm scoping.

1405
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:30,310
Okay.

1406
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:38,890
Might have to like use bottles and stuff to distract people.

1407
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,590
So then we can take them out, you know?

1408
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:44,290
I wish I could... Okay.

1409
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:45,410
Oh, what's over here?

1410
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:49,890
This looks like... This looks like an entrance.

1411
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:53,070
Straight inside.

1412
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,900
Oh my god.

1413
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:09,500
I know what the white paint means, but I'm too afraid to go.

1414
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,120
This actually looks like a great way to exit.

1415
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:18,180
This looks like a great way to leave the camp.

1416
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,840
This could be our escape route.

1417
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:24,180
Okay.

1418
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:25,640
The gamer paint.

1419
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,160
The gamer paint.

1420
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:32,100
Let's...

1421
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:48,390
Oh my god, there's somebody right above me.

1422
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,520
What do you guys think is the... Hey, I lost my...

1423
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,560
Oh, I lost my... No, I lost the mallet!

1424
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:04,120
I think it's in the water.

1425
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:05,440
No!

1426
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,020
No!

1427
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,900
I lost my mallet in the water.

1428
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:15,960
Somewhere...

1429
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,740
It's too stinky for me to tell.

1430
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:24,040
Those are food for the local spirit.

1431
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,160
Um, you're looking at a spirit right now!

1432
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:27,600
What are you talking about?

1433
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,320
It's obviously for me too.

1434
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,020
Hello, I'm your local spirit.

1435
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:41,860
Guys, I actually have no idea how to get in here.

1436
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:46,760
I have no idea what would be the...

1437
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,380
best way to get in.

1438
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,900
That would be...

1439
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:51,380
You know what?

1440
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,300
Let's just go back.

1441
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,740
If we die, we die.

1442
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,940
If we die, we die.

1443
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,260
We'll just go through and scope and see what happens.

1444
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:06,660
So many plants and flowers.

1445
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:08,720
Try the front door.

1446
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:10,280
You know, I did try that.

1447
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,740
What if I came in being like...

1448
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:15,520
I offer...

1449
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,000
I'm trying to see if I can find her.

1450
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,000
I don't see it at all.

1451
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:21,720
Sad.

1452
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:24,280
I come offering...

1453
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:27,420
Come on, Indy!

1454
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:28,340
You can do it!

1455
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,020
Indy!

1456
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,300
ViviCortex for the gifted.

1457
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:54,500
Nice.

1458
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,120
Well, that...

1459
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,480
That wasn't great.

1460
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:13,740
That wasn't...

1461
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:16,660
How do I even get up here though?

1462
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,540
Because jumping didn't work.

1463
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:21,980
Do I... Oh gosh, that scared me.

1464
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,980
Are you coming down here?

1465
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:33,540
No.

1466
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,280
Was I crouch jumping?

1467
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,580
I don't think I was... I didn't think I was crouched.

1468
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:42,460
I'll try again though.

1469
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:45,920
What?

1470
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,900
You don't see anything!

1471
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,420
Don't be like that mister.

1472
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:56,450
Oh my God, he's camping.

1473
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:10,590
Can you pull him?

1474
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,170
I can try.

1475
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,150
I can try to.

1476
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:18,770
Let's see if he comes back.

1477
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,830
Let me see if he comes here.

1478
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:24,790
Hello?

1479
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,550
Oh now you don't want to check.

1480
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:29,330
Huh?

1481
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:31,850
Now you're not curious?

1482
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,320
They won't come down here.

1483
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,220
Cowards!

1484
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,780
How do I get back up there though?

1485
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,380
Is the great question.

1486
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:30,000
They're throwing things at me!

1487
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,060
Rude!

1488
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:47,490
That was a mistake.

1489
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:49,350
There's even a bow in here.

1490
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:51,490
There is a bow in here.

1491
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,370
Good job.

1492
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:54,830
Hello?

1493
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,030
No, no.

1494
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:56,210
Hello?

1495
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:05,610
They'll all line up one by one looking into the hole.

1496
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:10,490
They'll all line up one by one looking into the hole.

1497
01:39:11,050 --> 01:39:12,570
And that's when I'll blast them.

1498
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:17,310
Look in!

1499
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:22,340
Look!

1500
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,840
I won't bother searching anymore.

1501
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:29,620
How do I reload?

1502
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:34,540
How do I reload actually?

1503
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:41,000
R?

1504
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:45,740
No, I don't...

1505
01:39:53,110 --> 01:39:56,190
Try to pull them with the whip into the water, they'll die instantly?

1506
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,910
No way.

1507
01:39:58,850 --> 01:39:59,950
I wish I could.

1508
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:01,970
Pull the trigger without aiming.

1509
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,590
I don't believe you.

1510
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:07,270
I don't believe you!

1511
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:09,410
Press R1 when the gun is out.

1512
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:15,140
No, it didn't work.

1513
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,400
Ok, I'm gonna press the trigger.

1514
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,520
Oh, it did work.

1515
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,600
Elias, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

1516
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,040
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1517
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,200
You were right though.

1518
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,440
You were right though.

1519
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,840
Is there anything I can throw?

1520
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:50,330
Oh my god, he's got a big gun.

1521
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:51,950
Come here!

1522
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:55,630
I got his face!

1523
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:56,710
Kind of.

1524
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:00,730
Are you gonna come in?

1525
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:08,330
Yeah, I am!

1526
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:09,910
I am really scared!

1527
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:12,270
I am!

1528
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:13,570
I don't wanna come in!

1529
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:15,090
Oh god, here we go.

1530
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:17,410
Time to die!

1531
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:19,390
If I die, it's me.

1532
01:41:30,530 --> 01:41:33,550
I don't think my whip did anything.

1533
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:35,710
Why am I looking all smug for?

1534
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,120
Wow, good thing we killed that guy.

1535
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:47,700
We never have to worry about him again.

1536
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,600
No, don't eat that!

1537
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,660
Indy, the health.

1538
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,140
What?

1539
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,400
Why am I getting an achievement?

1540
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,220
Celestial Delight?

1541
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:00,400
Oh, I ate a starfruit.

1542
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:01,720
When?

1543
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:03,300
When did I eat that?

1544
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,780
Perfect stealth boss.

1545
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:09,800
Thanks.

1546
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:15,270
Just now?

1547
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:16,590
Yeah, but I didn't mean to.

1548
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:16,930
Ok,

1549
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:23,190
let's get this guy.

1550
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:24,490
Is there anyone else in the room?

1551
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,650
Which way is he coming?

1552
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:41,670
Oh, there is two of them.

1553
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:56,620
Where is my hat?

1554
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,500
Where is my lucky hat?

1555
01:42:59,160 --> 01:42:59,820
Oh, there it is.

1556
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:02,600
Why?

1557
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,000
There is no reason to be so smug about this, Indy!

1558
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:19,670
Where is your money?

1559
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,350
Oh, I got a letter.

1560
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:24,990
I'm not gonna collect... I'm just gonna...

1561
01:43:26,050 --> 01:43:26,930
Revolver bullets.

1562
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:28,130
I'll take that.

1563
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:30,770
Where is your money?

1564
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,230
Give me all you got!

1565
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:33,430
Fifteen?

1566
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,110
That's it?

1567
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:36,850
Oh gosh, guys, we're never gonna make it.

1568
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:38,610
There's guns on the floor.

1569
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:39,330
True!

1570
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,560
Take that.

1571
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,120
What's upstairs?

1572
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:53,220
So glad the enemies in this game are a little dull.

1573
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:54,560
Really?

1574
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,530
Where are you?

1575
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:22,190
Ok.

1576
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:23,570
What's in here?

1577
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:25,530
Royal Army kit.

1578
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:29,870
Are you guys coming or...?

1579
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,980
Nice!

1580
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,660
Oh, now I have to use it as a...

1581
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:39,280
Shit!

1582
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,500
Where is my gun?

1583
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,300
I mean my hat.

1584
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,160
No,

1585
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,020
I died!

1586
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:06,940
Oh nice!

1587
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:09,400
Wait...

1588
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,020
Where the hell did you come from?

1589
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,740
What the...

1590
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:17,080
Oh my god.

1591
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:17,740
No!

1592
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,120
Where did you come from?

1593
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:24,360
I don't want to carry the body.

1594
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,100
Oh god.

1595
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:25,760
Oh my god.

1596
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,000
Where did you come from?

1597
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,320
Guys, this is the worst spot.

1598
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:33,080
Wait, this is the worst spot for a save.

1599
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,340
Are you kidding me?

1600
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,760
Where's my hat?

1601
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:37,860
No way.

1602
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:39,200
I'm gonna die.

1603
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:40,960
I'm dead.

1604
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:43,960
No, we're gonna get spawn killed every time.

1605
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,840
Oh my god.

1606
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,400
No fucking way.

1607
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:55,940
This sucks.

1608
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,220
This sucks so bad.

1609
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:00,200
All the guys that I just took out all respawned.

1610
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:01,160
Oh my god.

1611
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:01,940
Are you kidding me?

1612
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:02,940
Are you kidding me right now?

1613
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:14,350
Oh gosh.

1614
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:15,650
This sucks.

1615
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:17,570
This sucks so bad.

1616
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,230
Punch him!

1617
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,010
Punch him!

1618
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:23,610
Oh there is a dog.

1619
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:24,470
Oh my god.

1620
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:27,790
No!

1621
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:28,510
No!

1622
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:29,410
No!

1623
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,310
Where is my hat?

1624
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:33,930
This is so bad.

1625
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:34,870
No!

1626
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,060
Fuck you!

1627
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:40,260
Die!

1628
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:46,590
Oh my god.

1629
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:47,770
Oh my god.

1630
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:49,470
What do I do here?

1631
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,430
What do I do?

1632
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:01,350
Oh my god.

1633
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:08,610
Maybe if I run upstairs.

1634
01:47:09,410 --> 01:47:09,590
Run!

1635
01:47:09,770 --> 01:47:09,770
Run!

1636
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:09,930
Run!

1637
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:16,490
Gun!

1638
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:19,610
Gun!

1639
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:23,230
No!

1640
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:30,610
This is the worst ever.

1641
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,990
This is the worst ever.

1642
01:47:33,690 --> 01:47:34,090
Please!

1643
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:54,630
Okay.

1644
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:56,030
Okay.

1645
01:47:59,010 --> 01:47:59,450
Okay.

1646
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:00,170
Okay.

1647
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:02,220
Okay.

1648
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,120
Oh god.

1649
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,060
I know there is a guy out here too though.

1650
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:06,540
There is a guy out here too.

1651
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,440
Oh god.

1652
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:08,440
What am I supposed to do?

1653
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,660
This is the worst.

1654
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,220
This is the worst ever.

1655
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,100
Oh god.

1656
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,820
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1657
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:16,540
Take the money.

1658
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:21,660
It's nothing.

1659
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,000
It's nothing.

1660
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:23,420
It's nothing.

1661
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:23,500
It's nothing.

1662
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,400
It's nothing.

1663
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:29,550
It's nothing.

1664
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:51,790
Stealth is perhaps not... Guys, I'm freaking out a little bit here.

1665
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:55,470
Nothing.

1666
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:58,010
Nothing.

1667
01:49:01,070 --> 01:49:03,450
I have to silently take him out I think.

1668
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:05,570
Oh gosh.

1669
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:19,610
If I stand up will they see me?

1670
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:31,290
Just run and hit.

1671
01:49:39,810 --> 01:49:41,110
Get his ass.

1672
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:42,110
Get his ass.

1673
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:43,030
There we go.

1674
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,290
I got his ass.

1675
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:45,610
What's this?

1676
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:47,490
Oh that's his hat.

1677
01:49:49,310 --> 01:49:50,330
Do you have a lot of money?

1678
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,330
Yeah you do.

1679
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:53,870
Yeah you do baby.

1680
01:49:57,150 --> 01:49:58,630
But not enough still.

1681
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:01,390
But still not enough.

1682
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:10,650
Let's take this letter too.

1683
01:50:11,190 --> 01:50:11,850
Bribe letter.

1684
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:13,550
Wait, what's in here?

1685
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:16,810
Ok, this is good.

1686
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,810
We just have to figure out what the code is.

1687
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:21,530
We gotta figure out what the code is.

1688
01:50:21,930 --> 01:50:23,290
And then...and money.

1689
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:24,230
I mean medicine.

1690
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:29,050
What's your code?

1691
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:32,030
Maybe it's in the bribe letter.

1692
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,050
Maybe I should have read that.

1693
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:34,250
I was just scared.

1694
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:36,490
I was scared.

1695
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:36,910
I was scared.

1696
01:50:36,990 --> 01:50:37,810
Ok guys, hold on.

1697
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:40,530
I was scared.

1698
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:41,510
You can't blame me.

1699
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,950
Why do they just have skulls?

1700
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:49,570
Ok, no one else seems to be coming up.

1701
01:50:50,030 --> 01:50:51,790
What's in the letter?

1702
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:55,690
Bribe letter.

1703
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:57,310
Inspect.

1704
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:00,770
Gold.

1705
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:02,570
Included in the gift package.

1706
01:51:03,170 --> 01:51:04,810
The code is...

1707
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:12,600
Maybe it's 8008.

1708
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,040
Can you loot the body?

1709
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:15,980
Why is it highlighted?

1710
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,420
I was kinda wondering that too.

1711
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:20,000
Hello?

1712
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:28,230
Code instructions!

1713
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,330
5484.

1714
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:32,570
Nice.

1715
01:51:57,670 --> 01:51:58,690
Big money!

1716
01:51:59,930 --> 01:52:01,550
So we are good now, right?

1717
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:04,390
We are good now.

1718
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:05,910
Buy the breathing device.

1719
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:07,690
I guess we can just leave.

1720
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:11,310
How much money do we have?

1721
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:15,470
Oh wait...

1722
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:18,170
2353!

1723
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:23,860
Owie!

1724
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:25,520
Shit.

1725
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,160
Oh my god.

1726
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1727
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:27,920
I'm out of here.

1728
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:28,540
I'm out of here.

1729
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:28,920
I'm out of here.

1730
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:29,340
I'm out of here.

1731
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,260
No, no, no, no.

1732
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:31,700
Where is the thing?

1733
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:32,040
Here.

1734
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:52,140
Yes!

1735
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,340
Where did I leave the boat?

1736
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:00,120
Hmm...

1737
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:00,860
Gina?

1738
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:01,820
Gina?

1739
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:02,960
Gina?

1740
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:04,120
Start the engines, Gina!

1741
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:06,420
The engines are started!

1742
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:08,360
You never turned them off, Indy!

1743
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,020
Perfect.

1744
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:11,260
And it's saved.

1745
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:12,960
Oh yeah, baby!

1746
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,360
We are the best to ever do it.

1747
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,080
We are the best.

1748
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,800
Let's get out of here, Gina!

1749
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:28,260
Congrats, Robin Hood.

1750
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:30,860
Yippee!

1751
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:37,800
All it took was being re-zeroed for a second.

1752
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:40,460
Invisible wall.

1753
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:41,860
Invisible wall.

1754
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:51,980
What is that?

1755
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,200
Why is there a violin here?

1756
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,180
If not for a romantic time.

1757
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:06,170
What?

1758
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:09,650
Strange.

1759
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:12,050
Hold on, let's eat some bread real quick.

1760
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,300
Take two.

1761
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,140
Take two.

1762
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:20,400
No.

1763
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,240
Take two.

1764
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,280
Take that.

1765
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:23,320
Take that.

1766
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,920
No, don't take that.

1767
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:26,620
Take the other bread.

1768
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,160
I just ate two breads, did I not?

1769
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:33,760
Take the other bread.

1770
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:37,000
Take this.

1771
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:37,940
Throw it here.

1772
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,140
Take bread.

1773
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:41,940
Why wouldn't it let me take it?

1774
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,600
Don't look at me like that, Gina.

1775
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:54,560
I give up.

1776
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,340
Fake bread?

1777
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:01,600
Impossible.

1778
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:09,360
What's here?

1779
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:11,500
What's this place?

1780
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:15,680
This isn't a red zone.

1781
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:16,880
What is this?

1782
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:20,900
I see a shiny!

1783
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:22,960
Wait, no, that's the shiny we went to before, right?

1784
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:23,680
For the fast travel.

1785
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:28,360
I guess I could have fast traveled to the...

1786
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,060
Hot dog!

1787
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:33,920
We went from Indy to MGS3 for a little bit.

1788
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:34,940
Great job getting the gold.

1789
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:35,500
Thanks!

1790
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,360
It's a fight club!

1791
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:44,200
Dang it.

1792
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:45,560
New discovery.

1793
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:47,900
Jungle bruiser pit.

1794
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,900
Maybe we should just fast travel.

1795
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,020
No, it's not that far away.

1796
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,320
Oh, my bad.

1797
01:55:59,420 --> 01:55:59,500
Sorry.

1798
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,760
It's like right there.

1799
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:06,420
Jungle pit, baby.

1800
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:12,020
More like jungle pits, am I right?

1801
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:21,240
I wish I could go on a romantic boat ride with Mint Phantom in the jungle.

1802
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:22,240
Is this romantic?

1803
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:23,340
I'm stuck.

1804
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,740
First rule about fight club.

1805
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,560
We don't talk about fight club.

1806
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:32,760
That looks like a fancier boat.

1807
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,700
This looks miserable to be honest.

1808
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:49,940
It's hot, there's bugs everywhere.

1809
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:51,980
I don't know.

1810
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,940
I wouldn't say this is romantic.

1811
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:04,520
It's humid!

1812
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:09,620
This guy is scamming me out of a bunch of money.

1813
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,720
What is this?

1814
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:15,060
Literature compendium.

1815
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:18,000
Containing information on adventure books to be found.

1816
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:21,580
What about this?

1817
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,380
Oh, mysteries.

1818
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:26,180
This game has so much going on.

1819
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,700
Guess I gotta buy it.

1820
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:35,900
You'll find the yak.

1821
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,620
This guy actually sucks.

1822
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,520
Look at him.

1823
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:42,180
He looks so happy after robbing me blind.

1824
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,340
Find the yim.

1825
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:57,920
I saw some minkys in the tree over there.

1826
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,840
That's a far away travel.

1827
01:58:13,790 --> 01:58:15,610
Trying to think of the best way to get there.

1828
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:20,310
I guess just the way that we came, huh?

1829
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:24,010
We'll have to go through...

1830
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:27,190
Or the way that we went before, probably.

1831
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:31,710
I'm worried about the red zones.

1832
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:38,470
Oh yeah, we can fast travel to... Oh yeah, you're so right.

1833
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:40,890
We can fast travel to the area.

1834
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,690
What was that area?

1835
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:50,390
The secret armory entrance, you say.

1836
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:54,950
It's so secret they put it on the pole.

1837
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:56,770
Not the village.

1838
01:58:58,190 --> 01:58:58,850
This one, maybe.

1839
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:03,870
The sign is literally spoiling it.

1840
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:06,710
So secret.

1841
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:10,050
Ok.

1842
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,980
We're not in restricted area yet.

1843
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,920
They shouldn't get angry if we're just...

1844
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:18,700
I'm just looking.

1845
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,940
They can't get mad if I'm just looking.

1846
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:22,480
I'm just looking.

1847
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:25,760
If I'm just looking they can't get mad.

1848
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:28,580
See?

1849
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,780
This is why we look.

1850
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:33,960
This is why we look.

1851
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,920
This is why we look.

1852
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:39,040
I'm just looking.

1853
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:40,820
I'm just looking.

1854
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,080
They can't be mad if I'm just looking.

1855
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,800
I'm just looking.

1856
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,160
Hey there.

1857
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,960
Just having a little look.

1858
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:52,700
He didn't even notice me.

1859
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,860
I'm just looking.

1860
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:04,160
I'm just looking.

1861
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:04,520
See?

1862
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:05,900
They're not mad because I'm just looking.

1863
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:08,880
If I went inside they'd be upset.

1864
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,060
I'm just looking.

1865
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,140
Yeah, looking is not a crime.

1866
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:15,940
Exactly.

1867
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,280
But I took their bread.

1868
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:24,520
That might have been a crime.

1869
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,280
Oh look, our boat is here.

1870
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:34,540
Fast travel is the best.

1871
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:37,820
Can you tell smooches please?

1872
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:42,660
Berry bug.

1873
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:45,280
Berry bug.

1874
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:47,540
Berry bug?

1875
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:49,640
Hi berry.

1876
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,180
Do you want smooches?

1877
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:54,600
These are for berry's ears only.

1878
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,380
These are for berry's ears only.

1879
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:03,160
Everybody else mute.

1880
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:07,740
Type muted after you've muted in the chat.

1881
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:10,580
Say muted.

1882
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,020
Okay, they're muted.

1883
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:54,120
Off to find the yeek... I mean the yak.

1884
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,680
The magical yak of the river.

1885
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,900
Because, because, because, because...

1886
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,080
We have to yak the river.

1887
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,760
But we miss nothing, nothing.

1888
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:11,000
Can we unmute?

1889
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:22,980
If ever a yak there was a yak, the yak, the yak, the yak, the yak.

1890
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:27,240
Because, because, because, because, because...

1891
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,520
Because of the wonderful yak he was.

1892
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:33,080
Oh, this way.

1893
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:35,120
Turn Gina, turn.

1894
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:38,440
We can't hear you.

1895
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:38,780
When...

1896
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:50,520
Yak.

1897
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:58,340
Yak.

1898
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:07,880
She hates our nice boat.

1899
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:09,660
She'll get used to it.

1900
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:11,840
What was that splashing?

1901
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:17,420
It's looking mighty jungly in here.

1902
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:21,040
She thinks we could have walked this way.

1903
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,200
She's crazy.

1904
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:25,380
Yak.

1905
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:31,450
Wait, we can just ask for smooches whenever we want?

1906
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:32,610
No?

1907
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:35,070
What are you talking about?

1908
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:37,110
The yak.

1909
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:51,810
This is our guy?

1910
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:55,590
I think we can win him over.

1911
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:59,570
Oh, his mouth is full of leaves.

1912
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:01,690
That's how I like them.

1913
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,870
Yak.

1914
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:10,910
Yak.

1915
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:17,330
Sorry, since I practiced kissing on...

1916
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:18,770
Shut up, Gina!

1917
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:19,990
Shut up!

1918
02:04:20,490 --> 02:04:21,490
No, that's not what I meant.

1919
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:22,370
That's not what I wanted.

1920
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,310
You got lucky.

1921
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:27,270
I think you should swim in the water.

1922
02:04:27,810 --> 02:04:29,410
I think you should swim in the water.

1923
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:30,890
You mentioned the underground water.

1924
02:04:31,070 --> 02:04:32,830
Oh, let's put this on.

1925
02:04:34,090 --> 02:04:35,990
I think you should swim in the water.

1926
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:37,390
This is Gina.

1927
02:04:37,390 --> 02:04:40,010
Is this our tunnel?

1928
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:44,810
How much air does this thing have?

1929
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:48,070
I hope a lot.

1930
02:04:50,610 --> 02:04:51,370
Lift!

1931
02:04:57,670 --> 02:05:00,430
Gina, I swear to god.

1932
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:02,850
I'm investigating the statue.

1933
02:05:03,010 --> 02:05:04,770
What are you talking about?

1934
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:05,790
Hold on.

1935
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:08,350
Uh oh.

1936
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:10,090
Wait, I think it's running out of air.

1937
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:11,590
Wait, wait, wait.

1938
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:23,260
Oh god!

1939
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,780
It recovers the air, right?

1940
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:31,760
Like it will recover, right?

1941
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,160
How in the world can we hear her?

1942
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:36,280
That's such a good question.

1943
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:42,160
I'm investigating the statue like you said, Gina.

1944
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:42,240
Gina!

1945
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,160
Time to buy a new one.

1946
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:53,500
No!

1947
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,640
No, right?

1948
02:05:58,080 --> 02:05:58,460
No.

1949
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:02,960
Oh see?

1950
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:03,920
OK, OK.

1951
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:04,780
Keep going.

1952
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:10,820
I think if I go fast I'll be fine.

1953
02:06:17,650 --> 02:06:18,850
Is this an air pocket?

1954
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:27,080
Yes?

1955
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,120
OK, we got an...

1956
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:33,480
That's a yuck.

1957
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:35,240
That's a yuck in the water.

1958
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:36,060
Nasty.

1959
02:06:36,660 --> 02:06:38,240
Die with no clothes.

1960
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:41,380
Wait, are we talking to Gina from here?

1961
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:50,200
We are talking to Gina from here.

1962
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,740
That's so funny.

1963
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,220
OK, go.

1964
02:06:55,580 --> 02:06:56,140
Go, Indigo.

1965
02:06:56,700 --> 02:06:57,360
Go, Indigo.

1966
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:58,500
Go, Indigo.

1967
02:06:59,040 --> 02:06:59,700
Go, Indigo.

1968
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:08,950
Next air pocket?

1969
02:07:10,030 --> 02:07:10,750
Nice.

1970
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:19,240
Through here?

1971
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:25,730
OK, I see it going down.

1972
02:07:26,570 --> 02:07:26,890
Oh.

1973
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:28,870
OK.

1974
02:07:30,970 --> 02:07:31,290
Alright.

1975
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:33,570
Yikes in the water.

1976
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:34,330
Right?

1977
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:35,630
Oh my gosh.

1978
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:38,090
Oh my god.

1979
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:40,510
Air pocket?

1980
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:40,970
Air pocket.

1981
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:41,530
Air pocket.

1982
02:07:41,630 --> 02:07:41,910
Air pocket.

1983
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:43,910
Air pocket.

1984
02:07:54,330 --> 02:07:56,770
Fix the gear trains.

1985
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:03,030
Metal gears.

1986
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:12,350
Nevermind.

1987
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:15,350
Yeah.

1988
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:16,370
OK.

1989
02:08:19,610 --> 02:08:21,450
No, they are not metal gears.

1990
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:23,450
Wooden gear.

1991
02:08:27,830 --> 02:08:28,550
OK.

1992
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:32,830
I'll take a picture first.

1993
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:34,150
No, photo.

1994
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:38,850
Photo of the right gear train.

1995
02:08:42,410 --> 02:08:43,450
Wooden gear.

1996
02:08:52,730 --> 02:08:53,270
OK.

1997
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:54,990
Come here, temples.

1998
02:08:55,850 --> 02:08:58,630
Weren't we here before with an archeologist a few months ago?

1999
02:08:58,950 --> 02:08:59,910
Don't say that.

2000
02:09:01,730 --> 02:09:04,530
So do I have to put them in the correct spot?

2001
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,490
Oh gosh, there is... OK.

2002
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:10,090
I see.

2003
02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:15,530
That one.

2004
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:19,690
That looks good.

2005
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:21,550
Oh, there is one more.

2006
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,370
Nevermind, I lied.

2007
02:09:25,790 --> 02:09:27,670
Left gear train.

2008
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:35,910
Oh no.

2009
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:48,750
Pull.

2010
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:53,360
Pull.

2011
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:54,220
No.

2012
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,600
This one is too teeny tiny.

2013
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:58,260
OK.

2014
02:09:58,680 --> 02:09:58,900
OK.

2015
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:00,560
OK.

2016
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:01,360
OK.

2017
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:02,560
OK.

2018
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:02,860
OK.

2019
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:03,200
OK.

2020
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:08,720
Why is Indy talking to himself?

2021
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,900
It's just like the...

2022
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:14,560
I want this one.

2023
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,740
Are these the same size?

2024
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:18,940
OK, hold on.

2025
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:25,430
We put like that there.

2026
02:10:26,270 --> 02:10:27,050
Big boy.

2027
02:10:29,550 --> 02:10:30,510
Right there.

2028
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:33,110
Big boy connects to other big boy.

2029
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:35,650
And then... Oh no, wait, we need...

2030
02:10:35,650 --> 02:10:37,730
I think the teeny one is too teeny.

2031
02:10:38,070 --> 02:10:38,790
Wait, where did it go?

2032
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:42,650
Oh, this one.

2033
02:10:43,810 --> 02:10:45,470
Yeah, it doesn't reach.

2034
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:45,570
Reach.

2035
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:50,050
Can this fit here?

2036
02:10:52,050 --> 02:10:52,530
No.

2037
02:10:54,250 --> 02:10:55,430
Are there more?

2038
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:58,170
We need like a middle sized one.

2039
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:01,370
Do you think they are in the water?

2040
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:10,520
There is something on this side.

2041
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:16,020
Oh, what's in here?

2042
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:16,920
Wait a second.

2043
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,680
A whole lot of nothing.

2044
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:28,500
It needs both large.

2045
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:34,000
Like if I take this guy...

2046
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:35,680
Throw him away.

2047
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,400
Take this one.

2048
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,080
It doesn't fit though.

2049
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:53,230
What in here?

2050
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:54,510
I didn't see anything though.

2051
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:59,230
I didn't see...

2052
02:12:00,150 --> 02:12:00,830
anything.

2053
02:12:06,510 --> 02:12:07,130
Unless...

2054
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:17,270
Gamers don't look up.

2055
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:18,030
Where?

2056
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:19,150
That?

2057
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:21,070
Is that a cog up there?

2058
02:12:21,490 --> 02:12:22,250
Oh wait, hold on.

2059
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:25,450
I see the yellow tape.

2060
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:26,750
The yellow paint.

2061
02:12:31,770 --> 02:12:33,190
I'm glad you knew.

2062
02:12:40,730 --> 02:12:43,130
Indy is like, yeah, I'm smarter than you.

2063
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:46,010
Is this a...

2064
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:47,810
This is not a mid-sized cog.

2065
02:12:51,370 --> 02:12:53,110
Share with the class, Indy.

2066
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:58,290
Now I get our little cogs.

2067
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:02,900
Take it out.

2068
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:05,820
There.

2069
02:13:07,960 --> 02:13:09,000
Mid-sized.

2070
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,560
Take it out.

2071
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:14,880
Take it out.

2072
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:15,380
There it is.

2073
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:16,640
There we go.

2074
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:23,920
Yippee!

2075
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:27,640
Oh, there he goes.

2076
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:30,080
Ok.

2077
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:32,040
What did that do?

2078
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:40,280
Alright, let's take all of our...

2079
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:41,600
cogs back.

2080
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,840
I'm just gonna place you right there.

2081
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:51,640
Take you...

2082
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,820
and just stick you away.

2083
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:55,640
Take you...

2084
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:56,960
Take you...

2085
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,180
Take you...

2086
02:13:58,180 --> 02:13:58,380
Ok.

2087
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:05,180
So this one connects up here.

2088
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:07,120
So this actually looks good.

2089
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:08,160
Perhaps.

2090
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:12,040
Wait, cogwheel?

2091
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:15,580
Oh, no.

2092
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:17,300
And then this one.

2093
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:19,380
This might actually be it.

2094
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:24,010
Hello?

2095
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:28,330
Maybe the other way.

2096
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:39,060
I actually can't tell if this teeny tiny thing is gonna work in that, but whatever.

2097
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,200
You need to open the water first.

2098
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:06,260
Make sure you also get the cog...

2099
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,840
sogger.

2100
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:12,740
No, if they're soggy then we...

2101
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:15,980
Then they'll break.

2102
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:30,410
How do I open the water?

2103
02:15:32,130 --> 02:15:33,210
Is it in here?

2104
02:15:37,390 --> 02:15:38,410
Use that?

2105
02:15:39,010 --> 02:15:39,730
Use that.

2106
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:42,170
Use that thing.

2107
02:15:44,650 --> 02:15:45,950
Is it below?

2108
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:47,750
Use it!

2109
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:48,650
There we go.

2110
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:50,050
Goodness gracious.

2111
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:53,970
Is there anything else I missed in here?

2112
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:18,410
I don't even know where I came from.

2113
02:16:25,550 --> 02:16:26,250
Again.

2114
02:16:26,870 --> 02:16:27,630
Down!

2115
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:33,430
What?

2116
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:41,140
I didn't see anything on the way in.

2117
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:43,080
Doesn't seem like there's anything else in...

2118
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,580
here that I noticed at least.

2119
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:25,790
Do you want a hint?

2120
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:30,790
Yeah.

2121
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:32,590
I'll take a hint.

2122
02:17:33,330 --> 02:17:33,810
Wait.

2123
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:35,350
Do I need to crawl through here?

2124
02:17:35,810 --> 02:17:36,190
Oh no.

2125
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:42,040
I'll take a hint.

2126
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:44,200
No hint.

2127
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:50,120
Now you have to kiss it really sloppily.

2128
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,040
Shut up!

2129
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:56,120
It's in the room behind.

2130
02:17:59,220 --> 02:18:00,420
I have to go up?

2131
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:00,500
Up.

2132
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:02,780
Up.

2133
02:18:08,030 --> 02:18:08,830
Pay up.

2134
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:09,970
One kiss, one hint.

2135
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:10,410
No!

2136
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:14,130
When did we ever agree to this?

2137
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:17,630
You're scamming me just like that guy.

2138
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,420
Hold on.

2139
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:29,340
I'm just getting a vantage point from here.

2140
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:33,220
There's really nothing home.

2141
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:39,990
It's right there.

2142
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,510
Why?

2143
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:42,590
I can't see.

2144
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:48,160
Where?

2145
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:49,440
This thing?

2146
02:18:57,690 --> 02:19:01,810
Go back up.

2147
02:19:02,210 --> 02:19:03,210
What am I missing?

2148
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:12,490
I noticed that earlier, but I didn't think it was a...

2149
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:12,850
Ok.

2150
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:21,080
I was like, oh, that looks like it's interactable, but it didn't give me a prompt, so I didn't know.

2151
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:24,500
Yay!

2152
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:25,040
Ok.

2153
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:45,950
Oh no!

2154
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,750
It didn't work!

2155
02:19:53,890 --> 02:19:55,630
Maybe I do need to put in the big one.

2156
02:19:55,630 --> 02:19:56,730
Right.

2157
02:19:57,270 --> 02:19:57,750
Oh no.

2158
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:27,080
It's not gonna reach again though, is it?

2159
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:29,740
I can try.

2160
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:43,340
We have a problem at the source.

2161
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:51,460
So it has to be one of these little guys here.

2162
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:53,480
Or else it won't reach.

2163
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:10,620
This is how I had it before, I think.

2164
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:15,080
And this one, it turned all of them, but this one.

2165
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:15,100
This one.

2166
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:27,160
Big guy in the second slot.

2167
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:28,080
Here?

2168
02:21:34,610 --> 02:21:37,070
I don't think the small one will reach here.

2169
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:39,990
Yeah.

2170
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,300
Sorry, my nose itches.

2171
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:55,590
Oh, you mean like a big guy in the first slot instead of the two small guys?

2172
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:10,520
Ok.

2173
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:13,540
How many

2174
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:18,860
cogwheels do I have?

2175
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:19,860
I think three, right?

2176
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:20,660
Yeah.

2177
02:22:20,940 --> 02:22:21,540
Ok, perfect.

2178
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:30,500
There we go.

2179
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:32,060
That should be it.

2180
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:37,700
Yay!

2181
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:44,040
Alright.

2182
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:44,380
Alright.

2183
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:47,800
And...

2184
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:52,760
Cutscene!

2185
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,240
That is truly the best piece of paper.

2186
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:12,890
Tina, you can come in now!

2187
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:15,670
Jones!

2188
02:23:19,850 --> 02:23:21,990
Oh god, he's glitching out.

2189
02:23:31,750 --> 02:23:32,970
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

2190
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:36,930
If only we were a bird, we would have been able to get in here so much easier.

2191
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:44,050
Uh-oh.

2192
02:23:44,510 --> 02:23:45,150
Oh my god.

2193
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:46,770
It's a monkey man.

2194
02:23:46,830 --> 02:23:47,050
Ah!

2195
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:53,180
Gina.

2196
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:55,120
Gina.

2197
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:55,400
Gina.

2198
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:00,980
Stay still.

2199
02:24:00,980 --> 02:24:01,300
Haha.

2200
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:06,720
Snake.

2201
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:31,030
We gotta call that guy that goes to the Everglades.

2202
02:24:32,890 --> 02:24:35,090
The guy that's looking for that 20 footer python.

2203
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:40,950
Get to the pyramid.

2204
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:52,800
What's the catch?

2205
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,120
What's the catch here, huh?

2206
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:59,240
What if I go into the water?

2207
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:02,780
Alright, Gina.

2208
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:04,140
I'm gonna go explore.

2209
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:21,660
Ok.

2210
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:21,780
Ok.

2211
02:25:22,660 --> 02:25:23,520
It'll get ya.

2212
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:28,220
Watch out, it'll get ya.

2213
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:35,260
And it's one kill.

2214
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:37,640
One hit kill, so...

2215
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:39,320
Let's just...

2216
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:47,450
Oh my gosh.

2217
02:25:50,970 --> 02:25:52,710
The controls on this are kinda whack.

2218
02:25:52,830 --> 02:25:53,550
I'm not gonna lie.

2219
02:25:54,210 --> 02:25:55,270
It's not me, you guys.

2220
02:25:55,350 --> 02:25:56,410
It's really the boat.

2221
02:25:56,990 --> 02:25:57,770
It's the game.

2222
02:25:57,770 --> 02:26:00,230
I try to turn right, but it'll make me turn left.

2223
02:26:00,330 --> 02:26:02,630
But it's not inverted controls.

2224
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:04,610
So I don't understand why it does that.

2225
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:05,770
Do you know how...

2226
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:07,150
Wait.

2227
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:09,410
Did you...

2228
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:11,870
This boss fight was originally Resident Evil 4.

2229
02:26:11,970 --> 02:26:12,250
Stop!

2230
02:26:12,650 --> 02:26:13,730
Stop Resident Evil!

2231
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:17,410
Ok, it's all the way over there.

2232
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:19,510
So I'm just gonna floor it.

2233
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:25,950
Oh, that's not good.

2234
02:26:30,910 --> 02:26:31,430
Oh.

2235
02:26:31,570 --> 02:26:34,070
Oh, I was just gonna, you know...

2236
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,850
Look behind.

2237
02:26:35,270 --> 02:26:36,610
But I'm sure that works too.

2238
02:26:38,890 --> 02:26:40,970
The tower sticking out of the water.

2239
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:44,630
Got it.

2240
02:26:46,210 --> 02:26:47,970
Well, we're right next to one, luckily.

2241
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:01,960
So, um...

2242
02:27:05,860 --> 02:27:08,180
Oh, you're gonna make me do that, huh?

2243
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:08,580
Ok.

2244
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:11,460
Alright, I see it.

2245
02:27:11,480 --> 02:27:12,540
I see what we're doing here.

2246
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:14,940
I see it.

2247
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:21,010
Where is it, though?

2248
02:27:21,770 --> 02:27:22,750
Where's the snake?

2249
02:27:24,690 --> 02:27:26,170
Where's the slithery snake?

2250
02:27:28,430 --> 02:27:29,270
Where is he?

2251
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:31,010
Me birthday today!

2252
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:32,870
Want me to birthday thanks.

2253
02:27:34,830 --> 02:27:35,310
What?

2254
02:27:36,670 --> 02:27:38,630
Happy birth...

2255
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:39,130
Oh, wait.

2256
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:41,660
Happy birthday to you!

2257
02:27:43,410 --> 02:27:44,490
Ah!

2258
02:27:44,780 --> 02:27:47,110
Happy birthday to you!

2259
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:50,050
Happy birthday, DFU Cloud!

2260
02:27:51,470 --> 02:27:54,950
Happy birthday to you!

2261
02:27:55,670 --> 02:27:55,770
Woo!

2262
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:57,470
Happy birthday!

2263
02:27:59,260 --> 02:27:59,850
Alright.

2264
02:28:00,890 --> 02:28:02,730
I guess this is it.

2265
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:04,350
Alright, Gina.

2266
02:28:08,150 --> 02:28:09,130
Don't say that!

2267
02:28:09,670 --> 02:28:10,930
Why would you say that, Gina?

2268
02:28:11,690 --> 02:28:13,250
What the hell is wrong with you?

2269
02:28:17,630 --> 02:28:18,590
And lift!

2270
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:21,550
Oh my god.

2271
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:24,910
Ok, let's go get more...

2272
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:26,730
Let's go get more...

2273
02:28:27,330 --> 02:28:27,810
Oxygen.

2274
02:28:34,890 --> 02:28:36,550
Gina, why don't you do this, huh?

2275
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:38,870
Watch out for the snake.

2276
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:40,470
What are you being so cheeky for, huh?

2277
02:28:43,870 --> 02:28:44,930
It's not in here, though.

2278
02:28:45,250 --> 02:28:46,170
Oh god, I hear the snake.

2279
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:47,230
Oh god, I hear the snake.

2280
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:55,970
That's right, she can't swim.

2281
02:28:59,630 --> 02:28:59,990
I

2282
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:04,540
don't like that sound.

2283
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:06,700
What was the point of opening that up, though?

2284
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,260
Oh, damn it.

2285
02:29:13,440 --> 02:29:14,180
Oh my god.

2286
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:15,720
Let me out, please.

2287
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:25,860
I don't like this one.

2288
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:28,180
Let's go try this tower instead.

2289
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:39,220
Did I hear it?

2290
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:43,520
Snake can't get you in the towers.

2291
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:44,900
Yeah, yeah, I noticed that.

2292
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:45,320
Oh!

2293
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:46,740
There's something here, though.

2294
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:48,800
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

2295
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:55,360
Oh my god.

2296
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:02,440
There's also...

2297
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:04,300
Is that a tower or is that just plants?

2298
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:05,240
Let's go check it out.

2299
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:24,260
Just plant.

2300
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:32,140
As soon as we get into the water, though, that thing starts tracking us.

2301
02:30:32,140 --> 02:30:34,000
So, like, what the hell am I supposed to do here?

2302
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:38,140
Can I stop playing that BGM from...

2303
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:41,260
That part of MGS2 in my head right now?

2304
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,060
You know the one?

2305
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:46,060
What, the one where we're escorting Emma?

2306
02:30:54,650 --> 02:30:55,990
I hate you, Gina.

2307
02:30:56,410 --> 02:31:00,850
Gina, you're lucky it's a hassle to take my gun out.

2308
02:31:04,470 --> 02:31:06,330
What the hell am I supposed to do here?

2309
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:15,350
I just want to look.

2310
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:16,710
I just want to look in there.

2311
02:31:17,650 --> 02:31:19,750
I don't see...

2312
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:26,090
I can't really tell.

2313
02:31:27,970 --> 02:31:28,670
Okay, hold on.

2314
02:31:29,350 --> 02:31:31,430
I'm going to get more air and then we're going to leave again.

2315
02:31:32,890 --> 02:31:34,630
You can enter the other towers underwater.

2316
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:39,610
That sounds really scary.

2317
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:41,370
I don't like this at all.

2318
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:51,680
It did save, though.

2319
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:53,180
Oh my god.

2320
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:57,880
Is that a hole?

2321
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:58,960
Right in front of me?

2322
02:31:59,000 --> 02:31:59,360
Right there?

2323
02:32:00,580 --> 02:32:02,360
Alright, I'm going to go for it.

2324
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:09,200
Holy moly.

2325
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:11,300
We made it.

2326
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:16,620
It's just a snake.

2327
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:21,260
A big, big snake.

2328
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:24,960
Indy, you are completely valid for being afraid of this one.

2329
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:25,740
I'm not going to lie.

2330
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:31,700
This one is scary as hell.

2331
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:41,270
That's the hole right there, I think.

2332
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:48,480
Maybe it's my chance.

2333
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:52,980
Go, Indy, go!

2334
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,120
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

2335
02:33:01,260 --> 02:33:01,860
Uh-oh.

2336
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:02,980
Wait, there's no water?

2337
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:03,580
Oh god.

2338
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:04,900
Okay, we just have to keep going.

2339
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:06,260
Oh my god, no, no, no.

2340
02:33:10,340 --> 02:33:12,560
It looks like a ribcage.

2341
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:13,440
It's kind of cool.

2342
02:33:18,750 --> 02:33:19,870
But I'm almost out of water.

2343
02:33:20,050 --> 02:33:20,590
I mean, air.

2344
02:33:21,550 --> 02:33:22,570
We are almost there!

2345
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:23,610
We are almost there!

2346
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:26,170
No, no, Indy, don't die!

2347
02:33:26,470 --> 02:33:27,690
Indy, Indy, Indy, Indy.

2348
02:33:30,210 --> 02:33:31,310
Oh my gosh.

2349
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:36,130
We did it, baby!

2350
02:33:38,810 --> 02:33:40,650
You got plenty of water, yeah.

2351
02:33:43,430 --> 02:33:45,730
Definitely not water I'm more concerned about.

2352
02:33:46,210 --> 02:33:47,650
Wait, what did we miss though?

2353
02:33:47,650 --> 02:33:49,910
Wait, what's in there?

2354
02:33:55,210 --> 02:33:57,050
A to ascend faster?

2355
02:33:57,610 --> 02:33:58,490
Thank you.

2356
02:33:58,970 --> 02:34:00,550
Did I miss a spot?

2357
02:34:03,730 --> 02:34:05,750
Did I go to the wrong place?

2358
02:34:09,870 --> 02:34:11,730
Or is this where I came from?

2359
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:14,230
I don't know.

2360
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:15,410
Okay, here we go.

2361
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:17,290
Let's go.

2362
02:34:19,230 --> 02:34:20,630
Don't do that!

2363
02:34:24,870 --> 02:34:25,890
Entrance?

2364
02:34:26,410 --> 02:34:26,750
Where?

2365
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:29,790
Here?

2366
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:31,570
Oh my gosh.

2367
02:34:32,270 --> 02:34:44,030
We are fine.

2368
02:34:44,130 --> 02:34:44,570
We are fine.

2369
02:34:44,570 --> 02:34:45,890
We are not fine.

2370
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:46,610
We are not fine.

2371
02:34:49,610 --> 02:34:50,350
Oh my gosh.

2372
02:34:50,630 --> 02:34:52,630
What the hell am I supposed to do about this?

2373
02:34:53,190 --> 02:34:54,170
And I have... no.

2374
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:56,270
What?

2375
02:34:57,370 --> 02:34:58,570
Wait, what just happened?

2376
02:35:03,870 --> 02:35:05,430
Okay, at least it's safe here.

2377
02:35:05,570 --> 02:35:06,170
Thank goodness.

2378
02:35:09,470 --> 02:35:11,570
Okay, this isn't a bad place to...

2379
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:14,750
for it to...

2380
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:17,070
save.

2381
02:35:17,970 --> 02:35:20,350
Okay, so now we are in the... thing.

2382
02:35:21,070 --> 02:35:22,410
And then we go to the side.

2383
02:35:23,710 --> 02:35:24,070
I'm going.

2384
02:35:24,190 --> 02:35:24,410
I'm going.

2385
02:35:24,530 --> 02:35:24,790
I'm going.

2386
02:35:24,870 --> 02:35:25,150
I'm going.

2387
02:35:25,210 --> 02:35:25,750
I'm going.

2388
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:29,650
I see it!

2389
02:35:29,670 --> 02:35:30,150
I see it here.

2390
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:31,670
Next.

2391
02:35:32,030 --> 02:35:32,250
Next.

2392
02:35:34,090 --> 02:35:34,490
Lift.

2393
02:35:38,010 --> 02:35:40,250
Oh gosh, please let there be an air pocket in here.

2394
02:35:41,570 --> 02:35:42,070
Ah!

2395
02:35:45,250 --> 02:35:46,510
Air pocket?

2396
02:35:47,090 --> 02:35:47,730
Air pocket?

2397
02:35:48,350 --> 02:35:49,370
Air pocket.

2398
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:50,130
Here?

2399
02:35:50,470 --> 02:35:50,870
Air pocket.

2400
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:51,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2401
02:35:54,470 --> 02:35:56,310
Holy moly.

2402
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:57,270
Canoli.

2403
02:35:58,430 --> 02:35:59,350
Stromoli.

2404
02:36:00,770 --> 02:36:03,770
That was close.

2405
02:36:03,770 --> 02:36:06,070
I'll just add this to the collection.

2406
02:36:10,470 --> 02:36:10,990
Yippee!

2407
02:36:13,350 --> 02:36:14,550
We made it.

2408
02:36:15,270 --> 02:36:17,310
How is Gina gonna make it in here?

2409
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,060
There's nothing down here, right?

2410
02:36:27,660 --> 02:36:27,960
No?

2411
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:28,360
Okay.

2412
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:38,040
Okay.

2413
02:36:52,550 --> 02:36:53,010
Gamer?

2414
02:36:53,010 --> 02:36:53,470
GamerPaint?

2415
02:36:57,130 --> 02:36:57,590
GamerPaint?

2416
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:01,830
Master, it is time and welcome to membership.

2417
02:37:02,010 --> 02:37:02,530
Thank you.

2418
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:05,030
I missed the part where that was my problem.

2419
02:37:08,190 --> 02:37:09,290
Gamers jump down.

2420
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:14,630
Nice.

2421
02:37:14,630 --> 02:37:14,750
Nice.

2422
02:37:16,330 --> 02:37:17,570
I'm looking up though.

2423
02:37:17,730 --> 02:37:18,490
Just in case.

2424
02:37:20,570 --> 02:37:21,790
I don't see anything.

2425
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:28,490
I think if I drop there I'll die.

2426
02:37:30,410 --> 02:37:30,910
Whip?

2427
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:32,510
Oh, thank you guys.

2428
02:37:32,610 --> 02:37:33,170
I didn't see it.

2429
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:44,880
Nice.

2430
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:53,200
Nice.

2431
02:37:55,100 --> 02:37:58,020
Gina is just out there with the massive anaconda.

2432
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:01,060
No big deal, you know.

2433
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:03,620
She'll survive.

2434
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,440
Explore the pyramid.

2435
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:17,580
So there's probably gonna be a giant in here too that we have to fight, right?

2436
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:22,280
Since...

2437
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:25,340
Yeah, I was gonna say.

2438
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:27,540
It looks like the same.

2439
02:38:33,860 --> 02:38:35,540
Oh god, sorry, my nose.

2440
02:38:40,300 --> 02:38:44,180
Oh, I guess that works.

2441
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:46,240
Jump up, Endy.

2442
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:47,800
Endy, grab.

2443
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:49,460
Endy, grab.

2444
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:50,460
There we go.

2445
02:38:50,460 --> 02:38:54,540
Oh god, I was wondering what this was.

2446
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:57,680
Oh my god, I thought it was a...

2447
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,880
I thought it was like a blanket.

2448
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:13,320
Snakeskin.

2449
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:20,140
What's that over there?

2450
02:39:21,900 --> 02:39:24,240
Oh, what is that too?

2451
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:25,860
Giant mushroom.

2452
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:26,660
I've never

2453
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:33,520
seen a mushroom that big.

2454
02:39:35,980 --> 02:39:37,020
So funny.

2455
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:39,800
I don't wanna take a picture of that mushroom.

2456
02:39:50,260 --> 02:39:57,240
I think we can jump.

2457
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:03,780
That didn't work.

2458
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:16,070
See, I told you.

2459
02:40:16,470 --> 02:40:18,490
Look, there's three of them here.

2460
02:40:18,930 --> 02:40:22,270
I was just returning it to its rightful place.

2461
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:30,060
I was just returning it.

2462
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:36,900
Other people's failed attempts.

2463
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:39,960
Do you put them in those holes?

2464
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:49,750
Oh, shucks.

2465
02:40:50,250 --> 02:40:50,830
Oh no.

2466
02:40:52,110 --> 02:40:53,930
I think that wasn't it.

2467
02:40:54,610 --> 02:40:55,690
Skyraider, welcome to the membership.

2468
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:56,630
Thank you!

2469
02:41:00,030 --> 02:41:01,290
Oh, look at that.

2470
02:41:01,470 --> 02:41:02,090
It's lit up.

2471
02:41:02,230 --> 02:41:03,130
It's lit up red.

2472
02:41:03,130 --> 02:41:05,210
I don't know what I'm doing.

2473
02:41:11,260 --> 02:41:16,300
I tried the mushroom!

2474
02:41:16,900 --> 02:41:17,480
Better angle?

2475
02:41:17,720 --> 02:41:18,140
Okay.

2476
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:20,980
Maybe I need to go from the side.

2477
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:26,140
I didn't think we were gonna make that.

2478
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:26,980
I'll be honest.

2479
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:31,680
Nice!

2480
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:37,620
Oh look, they respawned.

2481
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:39,800
They know we're dumb.

2482
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:48,480
I think we should take one of these.

2483
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:52,020
Honestly, I think we should take it for the snake.

2484
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:11,130
Don't fall, Minky.

2485
02:42:12,130 --> 02:42:14,070
I won't...

2486
02:42:15,130 --> 02:42:16,910
I won't fall.

2487
02:42:17,890 --> 02:42:22,310
I won't...

2488
02:42:22,310 --> 02:42:23,170
I won't fall!

2489
02:42:34,830 --> 02:42:35,850
We're fine.

2490
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:37,970
She fell.

2491
02:42:39,370 --> 02:42:41,070
I fell again.

2492
02:42:58,190 --> 02:43:01,670
Use your arms, Minky.

2493
02:43:05,470 --> 02:43:07,410
Indiana Jones, you scare me.

2494
02:43:09,570 --> 02:43:13,630
Okay, there has to be a thing for my whip here, right?

2495
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:15,930
Can you shoot the snake?

2496
02:43:16,130 --> 02:43:17,770
I don't know, actually.

2497
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:25,390
I don't think there is a thing for my whip.

2498
02:43:26,070 --> 02:43:27,010
That's really unfortunate.

2499
02:43:31,530 --> 02:43:33,010
Didn't we get another grip book?

2500
02:43:33,090 --> 02:43:34,270
Oh, we did get a book, didn't we?

2501
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:38,890
But I think it's for enemies.

2502
02:43:41,790 --> 02:43:42,810
Still unlock it though.

2503
02:43:48,180 --> 02:43:49,300
I'm gonna run for it.

2504
02:43:59,300 --> 02:44:00,340
Oh my god, oh my god.

2505
02:44:00,500 --> 02:44:02,040
Get up there, get up there, get up there, get up there!

2506
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:06,260
How did I do that?

2507
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:15,160
Tridents.

2508
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:22,340
Okay, just end me.

2509
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:23,520
Just kill me, snake.

2510
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:25,120
Just kill me, snake!

2511
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:27,900
There is no way I'm making it back.

2512
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:30,600
Actually...

2513
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:34,660
Oh no!

2514
02:44:40,070 --> 02:44:42,990
Why did I think that I would start right there?

2515
02:44:44,450 --> 02:44:45,110
That's fine.

2516
02:44:45,110 --> 02:44:45,150
That's fine.

2517
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:55,060
It gives you quite a bit of time though before he attacks, I think.

2518
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:57,760
So it's not so bad, maybe.

2519
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:10,100
What sucks about running is I wish I could press down before I walk.

2520
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:11,900
Because there is not a lot of space here.

2521
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:15,860
If I push there, it's kind of tricky.

2522
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:20,580
Okay, there we go.

2523
02:45:21,020 --> 02:45:21,400
Cement.

2524
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:22,240
Flower!

2525
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:24,800
Thanks for the super chat.

2526
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:27,560
Thank you.

2527
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:31,040
Run!

2528
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:31,580
Jump!

2529
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:32,580
Nice.

2530
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:35,400
That won't be us.

2531
02:45:36,860 --> 02:45:37,840
Stupid idiot.

2532
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:41,280
Mushroom.

2533
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:45,020
Do I have to jump back to the other side again?

2534
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:48,440
Okay, interesting.

2535
02:45:50,140 --> 02:45:51,300
Can I?

2536
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:59,120
Can I hold this and run?

2537
02:45:59,260 --> 02:45:59,580
I wonder.

2538
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:07,040
Oh wait, I think I can do it from here actually.

2539
02:46:12,820 --> 02:46:14,260
We made it!

2540
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:29,410
Don't question it.

2541
02:46:31,710 --> 02:46:32,830
Oh shit!

2542
02:46:34,290 --> 02:46:35,810
Why did I do that?

2543
02:46:54,340 --> 02:46:55,840
Everything is A-OK.

2544
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:59,300
Watch, the snake is going to come out for us.

2545
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:01,160
While we are swinging.

2546
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:04,540
And...go!

2547
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:04,600
Go!

2548
02:47:07,440 --> 02:47:08,040
Alright.

2549
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:11,240
I don't know.

2550
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:13,100
I don't wish to know.

2551
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:16,940
My heart rate.

2552
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:20,120
Gimme!

2553
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:22,180
Thanks for 7 months.

2554
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:26,180
I don't like the snake near noise.

2555
02:47:26,260 --> 02:47:26,860
Me neither.

2556
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:28,820
The clicking is so scary.

2557
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:29,720
So freaky.

2558
02:47:37,980 --> 02:47:39,120
Oh my gosh.

2559
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:41,200
I was afraid I wasn't going to make that.

2560
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:45,060
But from here...

2561
02:47:48,310 --> 02:47:50,170
From here I'm not quite sure.

2562
02:47:51,410 --> 02:47:52,750
What do you guys think?

2563
02:47:55,310 --> 02:47:58,530
I've encountered many a snake but never one that uses echolocation.

2564
02:47:59,190 --> 02:48:00,810
This is Indiana Jones baby.

2565
02:48:02,250 --> 02:48:03,570
You gotta swim?

2566
02:48:04,530 --> 02:48:05,670
What to there you think?

2567
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:09,710
I think that's the...

2568
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:12,790
Yeah?

2569
02:48:13,090 --> 02:48:13,390
OK.

2570
02:48:15,090 --> 02:48:18,630
Cause I think that one is too high for me to climb from the water.

2571
02:48:20,730 --> 02:48:21,390
Oh gosh.

2572
02:48:30,090 --> 02:48:31,670
The light shows the way.

2573
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:47,140
What's that sound?

2574
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:49,720
Water drippy.

2575
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:50,820
Drippy water.

2576
02:48:51,380 --> 02:48:51,740
Oh my god.

2577
02:48:51,860 --> 02:48:52,200
Oh my god.

2578
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:02,420
Uh...

2579
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:08,520
What's here?

2580
02:49:12,580 --> 02:49:13,540
What's here?

2581
02:49:14,340 --> 02:49:15,520
What is here Indy?

2582
02:49:17,980 --> 02:49:19,860
How do I get to there?

2583
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:24,660
Oh the snake.

2584
02:49:37,950 --> 02:49:39,350
Is that a ledge?

2585
02:49:39,710 --> 02:49:40,130
This?

2586
02:49:41,450 --> 02:49:42,750
I'm trying to...

2587
02:49:42,750 --> 02:49:45,110
I think this one is too far for me to reach.

2588
02:49:47,870 --> 02:49:49,790
Can I climb up on to here?

2589
02:49:57,610 --> 02:50:00,030
I don't think that's white gamer paint is it?

2590
02:50:00,470 --> 02:50:02,590
I think that's just a...

2591
02:50:04,810 --> 02:50:06,070
Can you whip from here?

2592
02:50:06,170 --> 02:50:06,470
No.

2593
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:09,830
It would say RB if you could.

2594
02:50:10,650 --> 02:50:12,030
Alright I'll try the gamer paint.

2595
02:50:13,410 --> 02:50:14,470
Oh it is ledge.

2596
02:50:17,810 --> 02:50:20,670
Good thing we got our nifty grip up.

2597
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:29,300
Uh...

2598
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:32,380
Uh...

2599
02:50:33,110 --> 02:50:34,400
From here RB.

2600
02:50:40,720 --> 02:50:41,620
And...

2601
02:50:43,310 --> 02:50:43,760
Nice.

2602
02:50:49,530 --> 02:50:51,160
Why is the music escalating?

2603
02:50:55,150 --> 02:50:57,470
Why is it getting a little more intense?

2604
02:51:08,730 --> 02:51:10,590
It's making the water ripple!

2605
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:24,090
That's so awesome!

2606
02:51:33,450 --> 02:51:35,130
That's such a cool visual.

2607
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:39,900
I see it.

2608
02:51:43,720 --> 02:51:44,260
Hmm...

2609
02:51:45,860 --> 02:51:47,080
I'm looking around.

2610
02:51:48,340 --> 02:51:49,480
Oh good it just saved.

2611
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:52,120
Oh good it just saved!

2612
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:54,080
Yippee!

2613
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:55,160
Ok we are safe.

2614
02:51:55,660 --> 02:51:57,500
In case anything happens to me.

2615
02:52:01,780 --> 02:52:03,700
Do I go to the middle?

2616
02:52:04,960 --> 02:52:07,300
I think I have to go to that over there right?

2617
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:09,700
But I want to go look over there.

2618
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:10,380
It looks so cool.

2619
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:13,680
Ok.

2620
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:21,220
Ok.

2621
02:52:21,420 --> 02:52:22,120
Plan B.

2622
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:22,660
Plan B.

2623
02:52:22,840 --> 02:52:23,160
Plan B.

2624
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:24,620
What?

2625
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:29,620
Oh god!

2626
02:52:32,380 --> 02:52:33,420
I'm ready to fist it!

2627
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:46,460
Gotcha!

2628
02:52:49,910 --> 02:52:51,070
Where did the other one go?

2629
02:52:51,350 --> 02:52:52,570
Can more spawn please?

2630
02:52:52,570 --> 02:52:54,570
Wait, I need more...

2631
02:52:55,950 --> 02:52:57,530
I might have to use my gun.

2632
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:00,610
No, my gun!

2633
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:04,720
Oh up?

2634
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:05,840
Oh thank you.

2635
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:07,980
Thank you, thank you.

2636
02:53:20,690 --> 02:53:21,750
Ok, let's look up.

2637
02:53:24,910 --> 02:53:25,870
Damn it!

2638
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:27,050
What the hell?

2639
02:53:27,190 --> 02:53:28,570
But it was red I swear.

2640
02:53:31,350 --> 02:53:31,830
More?

2641
02:53:35,650 --> 02:53:36,930
Oh come on!

2642
02:53:40,910 --> 02:53:43,130
Turn into Sephiroth scene for a second.

2643
02:53:44,250 --> 02:53:45,470
That should have hit.

2644
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:46,590
That should have hit.

2645
02:53:48,190 --> 02:53:48,590
I'm

2646
02:53:53,800 --> 02:53:55,180
out of things though now.

2647
02:53:55,260 --> 02:53:55,760
For real.

2648
02:53:58,820 --> 02:53:59,420
I'm out of ones.

2649
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:00,160
Oh no, no, no.

2650
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:00,560
Just kidding.

2651
02:54:01,460 --> 02:54:01,900
Just kidding.

2652
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,240
Oh please, please, please, please.

2653
02:54:03,420 --> 02:54:04,060
Please grab!

2654
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:05,840
Please grab!

2655
02:54:07,460 --> 02:54:08,340
Ouch!

2656
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:09,120
Oh god.

2657
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:10,480
Bastard.

2658
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,140
Oh that hit hard.

2659
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:13,620
Oh that hit hard.

2660
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:28,950
Yippee!

2661
02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:32,490
We did it.

2662
02:54:40,590 --> 02:54:41,910
Victory jump!

2663
02:54:43,890 --> 02:54:44,850
Ok, nice.

2664
02:54:50,710 --> 02:54:51,650
The tower.

2665
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,460
Where did it go anyway?

2666
02:55:03,290 --> 02:55:04,070
Another pitchfork.

2667
02:55:07,900 --> 02:55:10,380
Yes, Indy, I would like for you to climb up that.

2668
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:11,580
Ok, nevermind.

2669
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:12,640
This one works too.

2670
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:16,280
Dang it, I need to go down that.

2671
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:18,220
Alright.

2672
02:55:20,890 --> 02:55:21,360
Shot!

2673
02:55:23,240 --> 02:55:24,180
I

2674
02:55:29,870 --> 02:55:30,810
can't!

2675
02:55:36,990 --> 02:55:38,510
Oh game.

2676
02:55:39,370 --> 02:55:40,310
Oh game.

2677
02:55:41,770 --> 02:55:43,390
If it works, it works.

2678
02:55:43,450 --> 02:55:43,890
Right baby?

2679
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:58,600
Can we grab onto this?

2680
02:55:58,700 --> 02:55:59,080
Oh we can.

2681
02:55:59,260 --> 02:55:59,580
Nice.

2682
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:07,590
Gina is just out there twiddling her thumbs I guess.

2683
02:56:15,590 --> 02:56:16,990
Oh my god!

2684
02:56:17,090 --> 02:56:17,550
Indy no!

2685
02:56:23,450 --> 02:56:25,870
You gamed too hard!

2686
02:56:28,110 --> 02:56:29,890
You gamed too hard!

2687
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:33,110
Oh my god.

2688
02:56:33,850 --> 02:56:35,250
Do I have to go all the way back?

2689
02:56:37,150 --> 02:56:38,230
Do it again?

2690
02:56:49,580 --> 02:56:50,840
Where am I?

2691
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:53,280
Wait, where am I actually?

2692
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:55,800
Oh ok, there it is.

2693
02:56:55,880 --> 02:56:56,080
Ok.

2694
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:02,560
Wait.

2695
02:57:03,100 --> 02:57:04,940
There we go.

2696
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:07,540
Indy had enough.

2697
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:09,400
So did I!

2698
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:13,820
I don't know where exactly we are going.

2699
02:57:14,960 --> 02:57:16,860
Around the ledge perhaps?

2700
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:21,260
Oh well.

2701
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:23,240
Yes.

2702
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:25,460
We can drop down here.

2703
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:29,640
Drop.

2704
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:31,160
Nice.

2705
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:41,200
Not good.

2706
02:57:43,440 --> 02:57:44,800
Not good.

2707
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:47,940
Wait, wait but...

2708
02:57:47,940 --> 02:57:49,000
What's over there?

2709
02:57:52,610 --> 02:57:53,670
Why does it...

2710
02:57:53,670 --> 02:57:55,430
Why is it...

2711
02:57:56,370 --> 02:57:58,270
It looks like I can go over there though.

2712
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:02,410
Geronimo!

2713
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:03,830
Welcome to Mamba Shop!

2714
02:58:04,110 --> 02:58:04,770
Thank you!

2715
02:58:05,310 --> 02:58:06,710
Oh I see the Shrine of Ashura.

2716
02:58:07,650 --> 02:58:08,510
I see it, I see it.

2717
02:58:09,730 --> 02:58:11,050
Oh I thought that was a snake.

2718
02:58:13,290 --> 02:58:13,690
Hit!

2719
02:58:13,690 --> 02:58:13,750
Hit!

2720
02:58:17,530 --> 02:58:19,450
But hold on, let's check this out first.

2721
02:58:19,610 --> 02:58:22,530
Because that looks like it's going to lead to the exit.

2722
02:58:23,110 --> 02:58:23,630
What's up here?

2723
02:58:29,930 --> 02:58:30,350
Secret.

2724
02:58:30,870 --> 02:58:31,430
What is that?

2725
02:58:41,390 --> 02:58:42,470
This looks important.

2726
02:58:43,610 --> 02:58:44,570
Take a picture Indy!

2727
02:58:46,710 --> 02:58:47,130
No?

2728
02:58:47,130 --> 02:58:48,370
Don't take a picture Indy.

2729
02:58:48,710 --> 02:58:49,210
Who cares?

2730
02:58:50,750 --> 02:58:52,790
Now I don't know where to go.

2731
02:58:54,650 --> 02:58:55,970
Now I'm not quite sure.

2732
02:58:58,090 --> 02:59:00,030
Because that one also leads up.

2733
02:59:00,730 --> 02:59:02,970
So maybe we go look in the tunnel first then.

2734
02:59:03,990 --> 02:59:04,990
Let's go in here first.

2735
02:59:13,500 --> 02:59:15,000
They all have gamer paint!

2736
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:40,820
When there's exploring in the Explorer's Game.

2737
02:59:42,380 --> 02:59:44,040
That's not the issue I have.

2738
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:48,760
Is that this game has been quite...

2739
02:59:48,760 --> 02:59:51,800
I don't want to say quite linear, but it's been...

2740
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:54,320
In terms of exploration, it's great.

2741
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:58,460
But when it comes to areas like these, it's pretty linear.

2742
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:04,520
When it's open world stuff, obviously it's nice and open world.

2743
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:06,320
But...

2744
03:00:17,010 --> 03:00:18,390
Maybe there's an Among Us.

2745
03:00:19,710 --> 03:00:20,950
Where are we?

2746
03:00:25,070 --> 03:00:27,670
It's more so that I don't like missing out on stuff.

2747
03:00:27,770 --> 03:00:30,850
So I'm like, if we had gone the other way, what...

2748
03:00:30,850 --> 03:00:32,170
What would have been?

2749
03:00:39,560 --> 03:00:41,600
It's just a hole, so let's crawl through here.

2750
03:00:45,320 --> 03:00:46,620
We're back out here.

2751
03:00:48,840 --> 03:00:50,760
Oh, we're all the way up here now.

2752
03:00:51,640 --> 03:00:52,320
Interesting.

2753
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,800
More snake skin.

2754
03:00:58,800 --> 03:00:59,480
Nice.

2755
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:02,340
Good job, Indy.

2756
03:01:05,180 --> 03:01:06,840
Just trust your instincts.

2757
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:08,340
As a gamer.

2758
03:01:11,750 --> 03:01:12,830
Okay, Indy.

2759
03:01:13,350 --> 03:01:14,570
Nice and shimmy.

2760
03:01:15,370 --> 03:01:17,570
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

2761
03:01:22,130 --> 03:01:24,130
The music's getting a little funny.

2762
03:01:24,690 --> 03:01:25,550
What was that sound?

2763
03:01:26,230 --> 03:01:27,130
Sounded like a hiss.

2764
03:01:28,170 --> 03:01:29,270
Like a snake.

2765
03:01:39,260 --> 03:01:41,000
Oh, we're so close to this though.

2766
03:01:45,230 --> 03:01:47,870
Something tells me that the giant snake we saw was actually a baby.

2767
03:01:48,010 --> 03:01:48,990
Don't say that!

2768
03:01:49,550 --> 03:01:49,990
Oh my god.

2769
03:01:50,430 --> 03:01:51,990
I jumped, but it didn't register.

2770
03:01:52,470 --> 03:01:53,610
That scared the hell out of me.

2771
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:56,090
That's sick.

2772
03:01:56,170 --> 03:01:58,070
Look, that's exactly how that guy died.

2773
03:01:58,930 --> 03:02:00,830
Or, that's what they want you to think.

2774
03:02:01,230 --> 03:02:03,050
They planted that afterwards.

2775
03:02:16,200 --> 03:02:17,320
Died a badass.

2776
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:19,680
I don't know about that.

2777
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:20,500
He got hit.

2778
03:02:25,360 --> 03:02:27,200
I don't know about badass.

2779
03:02:28,040 --> 03:02:30,520
Badass wouldn't have died.

2780
03:02:34,320 --> 03:02:36,460
Both paths lead to the same place?

2781
03:02:37,440 --> 03:02:37,800
Really?

2782
03:02:38,780 --> 03:02:40,840
Is that the way we would have gone, I suppose?

2783
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:44,840
Wait, I want to go in there though.

2784
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:49,120
Oh, we are.

2785
03:02:52,980 --> 03:02:53,980
Oh, I was asking.

2786
03:02:54,100 --> 03:02:54,720
Oh, I don't know.

2787
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:56,640
I have no idea.

2788
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:00,840
The other way was just a collectible.

2789
03:03:01,100 --> 03:03:01,560
No!

2790
03:03:02,760 --> 03:03:03,640
We missed the collectible.

2791
03:03:04,380 --> 03:03:05,400
Why did I do that?

2792
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:08,380
Sorry, my finger slips.

2793
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:17,170
My finger slips when I do that sometimes.

2794
03:03:17,490 --> 03:03:24,790
Because I grip the controller really hard when I'm pressing the L2 or L3 I mean, or whatever it's called.

2795
03:03:24,850 --> 03:03:25,190
L2?

2796
03:03:27,490 --> 03:03:31,550
So my fingers accidentally sometimes hit it.

2797
03:03:35,650 --> 03:03:37,370
You've been here the whole time?

2798
03:03:42,900 --> 03:03:45,620
She's been calling here the whole time.

2799
03:03:48,200 --> 03:03:49,660
I'm dead!

2800
03:04:08,580 --> 03:04:10,540
You liar, Indiana Jones!

2801
03:04:11,020 --> 03:04:12,180
You did not kill it!

2802
03:04:14,380 --> 03:04:15,860
You are a liar!

2803
03:04:16,980 --> 03:04:17,800
What's down here?

2804
03:04:21,810 --> 03:04:22,650
Oh my gosh.

2805
03:04:22,730 --> 03:04:23,230
Shut up, Gina.

2806
03:04:25,930 --> 03:04:26,430
Come on.

2807
03:04:27,490 --> 03:04:28,370
Get ready.

2808
03:04:33,250 --> 03:04:34,830
Yeah, no, he totally killed it.

2809
03:05:09,010 --> 03:05:10,010
Curse of Ra.

2810
03:05:15,470 --> 03:05:17,630
So this is what we are trying to open, right?

2811
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:20,030
Let's see.

2812
03:05:20,110 --> 03:05:21,050
What's this over here?

2813
03:05:22,370 --> 03:05:26,390
Seems like a knob to open the gate.

2814
03:05:32,470 --> 03:05:33,610
Just kidding.

2815
03:05:33,750 --> 03:05:35,670
Oh wait, there is one right there.

2816
03:05:37,610 --> 03:05:38,790
What did I just hear?

2817
03:05:40,270 --> 03:05:44,390
Ok, you grab that one and I grab...

2818
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:47,770
That's what I was saying.

2819
03:05:48,170 --> 03:05:48,430
Ok.

2820
03:05:48,810 --> 03:05:49,590
And go!

2821
03:05:56,850 --> 03:05:58,190
I'm sequence breaking.

2822
03:05:58,350 --> 03:05:59,350
I'm too smart for the game.

2823
03:06:00,990 --> 03:06:02,110
Game room?

2824
03:06:02,470 --> 03:06:03,270
We are gaming!

2825
03:06:04,130 --> 03:06:05,250
We are gaming for real.

2826
03:06:05,370 --> 03:06:06,250
Win the game?

2827
03:06:13,140 --> 03:06:14,780
Look at the little people.

2828
03:06:15,620 --> 03:06:16,440
Little people?

2829
03:06:16,860 --> 03:06:17,520
Big people.

2830
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:22,380
What's this?

2831
03:06:33,860 --> 03:06:34,340
Camera?

2832
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:36,200
Did I get a camera thing?

2833
03:06:37,060 --> 03:06:37,860
I don't think so.

2834
03:06:38,620 --> 03:06:40,100
I didn't get a camera prompt.

2835
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:49,300
I like how she's like, it looks like it's guarding something.

2836
03:06:50,080 --> 03:06:52,160
Oh, I guess it actually does.

2837
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:53,460
Nevermind.

2838
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:54,480
I doubted you, Gina.

2839
03:06:55,400 --> 03:06:56,380
Alright, what's the game?

2840
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:09,000
Uh...

2841
03:07:12,860 --> 03:07:15,660
I can only hold one at a time.

2842
03:07:17,980 --> 03:07:19,640
What the hell is this?

2843
03:07:20,220 --> 03:07:20,940
Win the game.

2844
03:07:24,400 --> 03:07:25,100
Hold on.

2845
03:07:26,040 --> 03:07:26,740
Ok, hold on.

2846
03:07:27,240 --> 03:07:29,320
There's gotta be a clue for this somewhere.

2847
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:33,780
There's gotta be a clue for this somewhere.

2848
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:41,740
Um...

2849
03:07:41,740 --> 03:07:42,880
This is whack-a-mole.

2850
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:46,040
I thought it was gonna be like you take it out and you try not to...

2851
03:07:46,040 --> 03:07:48,800
You know like the ones where you pull out the sword?

2852
03:07:48,880 --> 03:07:50,440
Oh wait, no, you stick in the sword.

2853
03:07:51,780 --> 03:07:53,420
And then the pirate pops out.

2854
03:07:55,780 --> 03:07:56,840
Nope, just play.

2855
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:02,280
Oh, these pop out.

2856
03:08:08,420 --> 03:08:08,820
Ok...

2857
03:08:20,720 --> 03:08:22,660
I just played the game by the way, chat.

2858
03:08:22,760 --> 03:08:23,800
You just lost the game.

2859
03:08:25,720 --> 03:08:28,280
That's quite a cough you got there, Mr. Morgan.

2860
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:34,360
Do I make them... What's the objective though?

2861
03:08:34,460 --> 03:08:37,380
Do I make them all face the same way or is it...

2862
03:08:37,380 --> 03:08:38,720
I can't really tell.

2863
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:39,180
Gina?

2864
03:08:39,540 --> 03:08:40,780
Did you just walk through that wall?

2865
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:49,340
What?

2866
03:08:49,540 --> 03:08:51,000
What was the name again?

2867
03:08:55,400 --> 03:08:55,840
Blackbeard.

2868
03:08:56,520 --> 03:08:57,560
Oh, I can't read the kanji.

2869
03:08:57,780 --> 03:08:58,260
I can't read the kanji.

2870
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:01,740
What, what, what, what, kanji, kanji, kanji, kanji, paper.

2871
03:09:09,140 --> 03:09:10,020
Ah, ok.

2872
03:09:14,920 --> 03:09:16,120
What's the objective?

2873
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:18,560
Gina's moonwalking.

2874
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:23,800
Are they all supposed to be in or out?

2875
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:25,680
Are we inies or are we outies?

2876
03:09:42,790 --> 03:09:43,670
Thank you.

2877
03:10:24,210 --> 03:10:25,650
That hat doesn't open.

2878
03:10:31,280 --> 03:10:34,740
Ok, now we have more game pieces to work with.

2879
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:39,640
So wherever they face... Gina move!

2880
03:10:43,220 --> 03:10:49,080
So whichever way they face... Wait, these only have... Ok, so these have one little dot.

2881
03:10:49,960 --> 03:10:51,860
And these have two dots.

2882
03:10:54,340 --> 03:10:55,720
These have two dots.

2883
03:10:57,400 --> 03:10:58,720
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2884
03:11:05,290 --> 03:11:06,130
And... here.

2885
03:11:06,570 --> 03:11:07,570
Oh, that's the wrong one.

2886
03:11:07,630 --> 03:11:07,970
Just kidding.

2887
03:11:08,270 --> 03:11:09,570
You, there we go, you.

2888
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:17,820
I figured out your code!

2889
03:11:17,820 --> 03:11:18,060
Code!

2890
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:27,580
Easy peasy.

2891
03:11:28,180 --> 03:11:29,300
Tsukutai!

2892
03:11:45,490 --> 03:11:46,190
Stone.

2893
03:11:47,990 --> 03:11:49,350
He's always smiling.

2894
03:11:54,010 --> 03:11:54,390
Oh!

2895
03:11:59,910 --> 03:12:01,370
Genius ghost mint.

2896
03:12:08,730 --> 03:12:10,250
He's smart.

2897
03:12:17,910 --> 03:12:23,930
Oh, you didn't like the picture taken?

2898
03:12:24,510 --> 03:12:25,150
What does that mean?

2899
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:32,400
The entrance is opening, but...

2900
03:12:32,400 --> 03:12:36,280
At least we got the picture.

2901
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:38,980
What's happening?

2902
03:12:40,760 --> 03:12:42,300
Are they all gonna turn?

2903
03:12:43,180 --> 03:12:43,840
What's happening?

2904
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:55,060
Oh no, indeed.

2905
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:55,300
Indeed.

2906
03:13:01,580 --> 03:13:03,320
Am I gonna have to punch you again?

2907
03:13:24,220 --> 03:13:25,620
Oh my... Gina!

2908
03:13:26,560 --> 03:13:27,120
Gina!

2909
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:30,800
I don't think that helped.

2910
03:13:33,960 --> 03:13:34,500
It helped.

2911
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:39,500
Gina.

2912
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:43,520
Run!

2913
03:13:44,220 --> 03:13:44,520
Run!

2914
03:13:54,350 --> 03:13:56,270
She's just watching.

2915
03:14:12,250 --> 03:14:14,630
We lost our hat!

2916
03:14:15,670 --> 03:14:16,050
Oh.

2917
03:14:17,130 --> 03:14:18,250
Oh come on, indeed.

2918
03:14:18,270 --> 03:14:18,990
You could've let go.

2919
03:14:19,070 --> 03:14:20,250
It wasn't that far of a fall.

2920
03:14:23,890 --> 03:14:26,310
Watch, the snake's gonna be in here too.

2921
03:14:28,210 --> 03:14:29,210
Oh my god.

2922
03:14:29,830 --> 03:14:32,350
We're gonna have to fight you and the snake at the same time, aren't we?

2923
03:14:33,890 --> 03:14:35,010
Oh my god, no.

2924
03:14:40,870 --> 03:14:41,630
Oh god.

2925
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:49,720
Ah!

2926
03:14:53,460 --> 03:14:54,340
Press A.

2927
03:14:57,440 --> 03:14:59,640
Thanks for the tutorial, game.

2928
03:14:59,900 --> 03:15:00,620
Oh god, oh god.

2929
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:10,180
Oh my god, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

2930
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:12,820
Yeah, I'm dead.

2931
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:13,580
I'm so dead.

2932
03:15:15,780 --> 03:15:16,560
That's OK.

2933
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:20,100
It's OK because I...

2934
03:15:20,100 --> 03:15:22,340
Oh my god, this is where we start?

2935
03:15:22,760 --> 03:15:23,240
Wait!

2936
03:15:23,440 --> 03:15:23,880
Oh my god!

2937
03:15:24,820 --> 03:15:25,960
Please, I wanna heal!

2938
03:15:32,450 --> 03:15:33,710
This way to the...

2939
03:15:35,410 --> 03:15:37,050
This way to the...

2940
03:15:41,690 --> 03:15:43,650
Oh my god, oh my god.

2941
03:15:44,050 --> 03:15:44,970
I'm trying to dodge.

2942
03:15:46,970 --> 03:15:48,130
Oh my god.

2943
03:15:48,750 --> 03:15:49,670
I'm trying to dodge.

2944
03:15:55,470 --> 03:15:57,350
I can't see anything!

2945
03:15:58,970 --> 03:16:00,350
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2946
03:16:02,890 --> 03:16:03,870
Oh my god.

2947
03:16:04,830 --> 03:16:05,830
Welcome to membership.

2948
03:16:05,950 --> 03:16:06,570
Thank you!

2949
03:16:07,190 --> 03:16:08,490
OK, OK.

2950
03:16:08,890 --> 03:16:09,530
Alright.

2951
03:16:23,930 --> 03:16:24,570
Ouch!

2952
03:16:24,690 --> 03:16:24,870
Ouch!

2953
03:16:24,870 --> 03:16:26,490
How is his swing so big?

2954
03:16:27,370 --> 03:16:28,290
Good lord!

2955
03:16:31,570 --> 03:16:32,210
Oh.

2956
03:16:32,450 --> 03:16:33,370
Oh my gosh.

2957
03:16:33,470 --> 03:16:33,690
No!

2958
03:16:34,030 --> 03:16:36,230
I can't dodge because it uses stamina.

2959
03:16:36,870 --> 03:16:38,650
When he does that...

2960
03:16:38,650 --> 03:16:39,350
Oh gosh.

2961
03:16:50,430 --> 03:16:51,810
Or maybe it doesn't.

2962
03:16:56,690 --> 03:16:58,630
Oh it does, it does, it does.

2963
03:17:01,950 --> 03:17:03,590
I'm gathering stamina again.

2964
03:17:04,030 --> 03:17:05,330
I'm gaining my stamina back.

2965
03:17:08,010 --> 03:17:10,330
I'm gaining my... No I'm not gaining my stamina.

2966
03:17:11,310 --> 03:17:12,470
What the fuck?

2967
03:17:12,710 --> 03:17:14,410
Why am I not gaining my stamina back?

2968
03:17:18,190 --> 03:17:19,750
How do I get out of fight mode?

2969
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:24,450
OK,

2970
03:17:27,870 --> 03:17:28,230
OK.

2971
03:17:28,570 --> 03:17:29,630
Nice, nice.

2972
03:17:39,790 --> 03:17:41,890
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

2973
03:17:41,890 --> 03:17:42,890
Am

2974
03:17:55,010 --> 03:17:56,390
I supposed to do this?

2975
03:17:56,750 --> 03:17:57,630
Or is this the cutscene?

2976
03:17:57,970 --> 03:17:58,610
I can't tell.

2977
03:18:00,990 --> 03:18:01,630
R3!

2978
03:18:02,690 --> 03:18:03,210
R3!

2979
03:18:13,300 --> 03:18:15,100
Mirror of the snake, baby!

2980
03:18:34,090 --> 03:18:35,050
Get hugged!

2981
03:18:37,590 --> 03:18:38,250
No, nothing.

2982
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:46,870
It's a depression.

2983
03:18:53,280 --> 03:18:54,350
Stop hugging!

2984
03:18:58,410 --> 03:18:59,750
School boys!

2985
03:19:00,970 --> 03:19:02,310
He's trying to kill me!

2986
03:19:07,590 --> 03:19:08,730
So true.

2987
03:19:09,590 --> 03:19:11,290
Speak some sense into the sky.

2988
03:19:11,290 --> 03:19:15,110
I must protect the words.

2989
03:19:15,850 --> 03:19:18,910
I must atone for my ancestors.

2990
03:19:19,490 --> 03:19:20,510
For god's sake!

2991
03:19:20,930 --> 03:19:21,650
Who cares?

2992
03:19:22,530 --> 03:19:24,110
You are both stuck in the past.

2993
03:19:24,610 --> 03:19:28,810
And right now there is a great evil spreading throughout the world.

2994
03:19:29,610 --> 03:19:32,670
And we can choose to fight against it or each other.

2995
03:19:36,150 --> 03:19:38,010
He looks so tired.

2996
03:19:44,410 --> 03:19:45,370
Great distraction!

2997
03:19:46,250 --> 03:19:47,830
I meant what I said.

2998
03:19:50,690 --> 03:19:51,710
Let's get out of here.

2999
03:19:52,430 --> 03:19:54,630
This place gives me the gibbie gibbies.

3000
03:19:54,770 --> 03:19:55,790
The gibbie gibbies!

3001
03:19:57,070 --> 03:19:59,190
You got him out of the water though, right?

3002
03:19:59,450 --> 03:20:02,150
That guy fell face first into the water.

3003
03:20:04,630 --> 03:20:05,590
Like you...

3004
03:20:07,430 --> 03:20:10,910
You like turned him over though, right?

3005
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:18,640
Anyway...

3006
03:20:20,980 --> 03:20:22,580
He's too tall to drown.

3007
03:20:23,400 --> 03:20:24,820
Fair, fair, fair.

3008
03:20:27,440 --> 03:20:29,260
Alright, let's go home.

3009
03:20:34,500 --> 03:20:36,240
Yeah, we just walk it off.

3010
03:20:37,780 --> 03:20:39,860
Just everybody do a little stretch.

3011
03:20:41,580 --> 03:20:43,340
Oh, this is where we came in from.

3012
03:20:43,440 --> 03:20:44,240
That's so exciting.

3013
03:20:47,440 --> 03:20:49,960
Gina did absolutely nothing.

3014
03:20:50,100 --> 03:20:51,280
She didn't have to help at all.

3015
03:20:52,820 --> 03:20:54,460
Wait, so why are we leaving?

3016
03:20:54,660 --> 03:20:54,980
Where is it?

3017
03:21:03,980 --> 03:21:07,700
I was gonna say, because like...

3018
03:21:07,700 --> 03:21:08,760
A study in fear.

3019
03:21:09,880 --> 03:21:13,780
Because didn't we say that the map was gonna help us find the stone in there?

3020
03:21:13,940 --> 03:21:14,700
But I guess not.

3021
03:21:15,080 --> 03:21:16,500
I guess it's not inside.

3022
03:21:17,620 --> 03:21:18,560
What else we got?

3023
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:19,300
Study in fear.

3024
03:21:19,740 --> 03:21:23,420
Might be worth stopping by Pailin before talking to Sunan.

3025
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:28,780
No one has better insight into the fascist activity in the area than she does.

3026
03:21:31,020 --> 03:21:32,760
And then the kid who vanished.

3027
03:21:32,880 --> 03:21:34,140
We gotta find the tree house.

3028
03:21:34,640 --> 03:21:36,120
I'm kinda curious about this one.

3029
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:39,500
Let's track that one.

3030
03:21:40,900 --> 03:21:42,840
Because we found the tree house before.

3031
03:21:44,620 --> 03:21:45,880
Oh, wrong way.

3032
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:48,180
Wait, what's over here actually?

3033
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:58,320
Among us?

3034
03:22:02,790 --> 03:22:03,930
Oh, we can take a photo.

3035
03:22:08,860 --> 03:22:09,580
That's it?

3036
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:12,700
Indy is drowning.

3037
03:22:12,940 --> 03:22:14,760
I missed the part where that's my problem.

3038
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:18,200
Romantic.

3039
03:22:18,880 --> 03:22:21,180
Now it's a romantic boat ride.

3040
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:49,800
Look at her, you know you do.

3041
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:53,300
It's possible she wants you to.

3042
03:22:53,660 --> 03:22:56,980
It's just one thing to ask her.

3043
03:22:57,820 --> 03:23:01,540
It don't take a word, not a single word.

3044
03:23:01,640 --> 03:23:04,300
Thanks for the 5 gifted subs.

3045
03:23:04,660 --> 03:23:05,160
Memberships.

3046
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:10,740
I know how to drive this thing.

3047
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:18,960
Look like the boy is too shy.

3048
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:21,660
He's gonna kiss the girl.

3049
03:23:23,600 --> 03:23:25,180
Ain't that sad?

3050
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:26,300
It's such a shame.

3051
03:23:26,440 --> 03:23:29,720
Too bad you're gonna miss the girl.

3052
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:31,860
Wait, we didn't get this one before.

3053
03:23:32,060 --> 03:23:32,620
What is this?

3054
03:23:35,820 --> 03:23:36,380
Sorry.

3055
03:23:40,800 --> 03:23:42,920
She gets out of the boat so fast.

3056
03:23:43,620 --> 03:23:44,520
Where are we?

3057
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:45,100
It

3058
03:23:50,500 --> 03:23:54,720
doesn't say restricted.

3059
03:23:59,540 --> 03:24:00,100
Tiger.

3060
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:06,120
Another one.

3061
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:07,840
What is this place?

3062
03:24:10,280 --> 03:24:11,540
Things I can steal.

3063
03:24:15,420 --> 03:24:18,400
That's actually... Nope, that's not what I wanted to do.

3064
03:24:19,080 --> 03:24:20,220
Yeah, maybe heal.

3065
03:24:20,340 --> 03:24:21,640
That's exactly what I was gonna do.

3066
03:24:22,580 --> 03:24:25,260
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

3067
03:24:27,580 --> 03:24:28,580
And heal.

3068
03:24:30,120 --> 03:24:31,220
We're just looking.

3069
03:24:34,220 --> 03:24:35,960
And stamina, stamina, stamina.

3070
03:24:36,400 --> 03:24:37,520
That's not what I meant to do.

3071
03:24:39,300 --> 03:24:39,800
Stamina.

3072
03:24:42,180 --> 03:24:43,380
These are heals, right?

3073
03:24:43,560 --> 03:24:44,240
Yeah, bandage.

3074
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:44,820
Nice.

3075
03:24:46,040 --> 03:24:47,000
Nice, nice, nice.

3076
03:24:49,860 --> 03:24:50,340
Nice.

3077
03:24:51,740 --> 03:24:53,980
I love these little stock areas.

3078
03:24:57,160 --> 03:24:58,680
You think they'll get mad at me?

3079
03:25:00,320 --> 03:25:02,400
I mean, maybe they shouldn't leave their food around.

3080
03:25:03,180 --> 03:25:03,800
The gun?

3081
03:25:04,520 --> 03:25:06,120
I don't think I need it right now, right?

3082
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:18,240
I mean, this isn't a restricted area.

3083
03:25:20,460 --> 03:25:20,940
Right?

3084
03:25:25,100 --> 03:25:25,880
Hold on.

3085
03:25:26,220 --> 03:25:28,680
I'm gonna go to where they'll save for me.

3086
03:25:31,580 --> 03:25:33,560
I think it saves down here.

3087
03:25:38,420 --> 03:25:38,940
Hello.

3088
03:25:39,200 --> 03:25:39,600
Okay, bye.

3089
03:25:45,610 --> 03:25:47,510
I'm just exploring a little bit.

3090
03:25:50,250 --> 03:25:51,870
I'm just gonna waltz on in.

3091
03:25:52,090 --> 03:25:54,770
If you have the gusto...

3092
03:25:55,210 --> 03:25:57,810
If you have the gusto, they won't question it, you know?

3093
03:25:58,390 --> 03:26:01,030
They'll be like, this guy is meant to be here.

3094
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:04,310
We just gotta go in with confidence.

3095
03:26:05,170 --> 03:26:07,050
We just gotta be like...

3096
03:26:07,790 --> 03:26:10,170
We just gotta be like, yeah, I'm meant to be here.

3097
03:26:11,310 --> 03:26:12,330
Act like you belong there.

3098
03:26:12,410 --> 03:26:13,770
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

3099
03:26:16,190 --> 03:26:17,370
I belong here.

3100
03:26:20,810 --> 03:26:21,890
I belong here.

3101
03:26:23,370 --> 03:26:24,450
I belong here.

3102
03:26:28,370 --> 03:26:29,630
Oh, I don't belong here.

3103
03:26:39,160 --> 03:26:40,260
I don't belong here.

3104
03:26:41,060 --> 03:26:41,760
I don't belong here.

3105
03:26:46,920 --> 03:26:50,360
Gina, start the boat!

3106
03:26:51,200 --> 03:26:51,680
Gina!

3107
03:26:52,120 --> 03:26:53,360
Gina, start the boat!

3108
03:26:54,840 --> 03:26:55,280
Gina!

3109
03:26:55,280 --> 03:26:56,500
Gina, Gina, start the boat.

3110
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,020
Gina, we gotta get out of here, Gina.

3111
03:26:59,220 --> 03:26:59,940
I messed up.

3112
03:27:00,160 --> 03:27:01,580
Gina, I thought it was okay here.

3113
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:03,880
We gotta fast travel.

3114
03:27:04,900 --> 03:27:05,420
Oh no.

3115
03:27:08,260 --> 03:27:09,140
Whose house?

3116
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:10,340
Where can we go?

3117
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:11,420
Everywhere is locked.

3118
03:27:14,720 --> 03:27:15,640
Gina, start the boat.

3119
03:27:26,340 --> 03:27:28,260
Oh my!

3120
03:27:30,460 --> 03:27:32,320
See you later, suckers!

3121
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:36,560
Stupid!

3122
03:27:37,880 --> 03:27:39,400
Where are we?

3123
03:27:40,140 --> 03:27:43,100
Okay, we gotta go this way, I think.

3124
03:27:48,900 --> 03:27:51,080
Take a picture of what?

3125
03:27:54,200 --> 03:27:56,120
Capsize barges.

3126
03:27:59,980 --> 03:28:01,260
Not us.

3127
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:05,340
What

3128
03:28:14,300 --> 03:28:14,440
the?

3129
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:15,880
Gina, are you okay?

3130
03:28:17,420 --> 03:28:18,560
You good girl?

3131
03:28:20,120 --> 03:28:22,140
Hold on, spider monkey.

3132
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:34,200
Hold on tight, spider monkey.

3133
03:28:34,460 --> 03:28:35,420
Did we get this one?

3134
03:28:35,960 --> 03:28:37,540
No, we didn't get this one either.

3135
03:28:40,560 --> 03:28:43,160
Did this technically dock the boat?

3136
03:28:43,560 --> 03:28:44,400
I guess so.

3137
03:28:49,930 --> 03:28:52,770
Now we can fast travel, huh?

3138
03:28:53,910 --> 03:28:55,230
What is this place?

3139
03:29:03,680 --> 03:29:05,360
Here is the radio.

3140
03:29:05,780 --> 03:29:08,440
Is that what makes it so that I can come back?

3141
03:29:10,960 --> 03:29:12,460
Boat is docked.

3142
03:29:18,200 --> 03:29:19,120
Tiger!

3143
03:29:19,800 --> 03:29:22,960
I don't think I'm welcome here.

3144
03:29:26,620 --> 03:29:29,220
I have a sneaking suspicion.

3145
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:34,860
That I'm not welcome here.

3146
03:29:39,050 --> 03:29:41,570
The boat started to annoy the heck out of me.

3147
03:29:42,930 --> 03:29:43,470
Really?

3148
03:29:43,470 --> 03:29:43,650
Really?

3149
03:29:46,570 --> 03:29:51,470
So far I'm not hating it so much, but...

3150
03:29:53,250 --> 03:29:55,070
You know, I can understand.

3151
03:29:57,210 --> 03:30:04,530
It's definitely probably not the most exciting of the places we've been and things we've done.

3152
03:30:04,770 --> 03:30:05,670
Nate, welcome to membership.

3153
03:30:05,910 --> 03:30:06,490
Thank you.

3154
03:30:14,160 --> 03:30:15,960
Okay, so we're gonna pass you.

3155
03:30:16,750 --> 03:30:20,540
This is the guy that we got the breathing thing from.

3156
03:30:24,930 --> 03:30:27,790
I guess we could have fast traveled to his place, huh?

3157
03:30:27,970 --> 03:30:28,890
Now that I think about it.

3158
03:30:30,610 --> 03:30:31,930
I'm sorry guys, I'm so stupid.

3159
03:30:38,230 --> 03:30:39,750
It's like right in here.

3160
03:30:41,790 --> 03:30:42,330
Treehouse.

3161
03:30:52,220 --> 03:30:53,960
Is that gamer paint?

3162
03:30:59,210 --> 03:31:02,130
I swear though, I think they're gonna have me wanting to...

3163
03:31:02,130 --> 03:31:03,550
They're like, this kid's gone missing.

3164
03:31:03,710 --> 03:31:05,470
I think they're gonna want me to try and find him.

3165
03:31:05,510 --> 03:31:09,170
And he's gonna be locked in like some place.

3166
03:31:09,950 --> 03:31:11,130
I don't think that's gamer paint.

3167
03:31:13,490 --> 03:31:17,110
And it's gonna be in like one of those little campgrounds.

3168
03:31:17,730 --> 03:31:19,250
I just don't feel...

3169
03:31:21,470 --> 03:31:21,870
Where?

3170
03:31:24,050 --> 03:31:25,350
Oh, up there.

3171
03:31:28,630 --> 03:31:31,110
I'm paranoid of the water now.

3172
03:31:35,970 --> 03:31:36,930
Random doll.

3173
03:31:37,070 --> 03:31:37,750
Welcome to membership.

3174
03:31:37,910 --> 03:31:38,650
Thank you!

3175
03:31:40,150 --> 03:31:40,970
The frog for death.

3176
03:31:41,050 --> 03:31:41,650
Welcome to membership.

3177
03:31:41,850 --> 03:31:42,390
Thank you.

3178
03:31:48,260 --> 03:31:49,820
Boat is docked?

3179
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:51,200
Oh.

3180
03:31:57,580 --> 03:31:58,280
Cool!

3181
03:32:00,640 --> 03:32:02,040
Nice.

3182
03:32:02,800 --> 03:32:03,320
Thanks Gina.

3183
03:32:08,720 --> 03:32:11,520
I'm not

3184
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:17,220
quite sure.

3185
03:32:19,300 --> 03:32:20,340
Item limit.

3186
03:32:20,440 --> 03:32:21,580
Oh, the repair box.

3187
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:25,940
Gina's just strolling on in though.

3188
03:32:26,200 --> 03:32:27,040
Maybe we're fine.

3189
03:32:29,580 --> 03:32:31,020
So I gotta go up there?

3190
03:32:35,140 --> 03:32:36,340
Maybe we have to go around.

3191
03:32:38,820 --> 03:32:39,860
And she's gone.

3192
03:32:40,900 --> 03:32:41,340
Gina.

3193
03:32:43,380 --> 03:32:45,620
Gina, I need you to have like a little bit more...

3194
03:32:46,680 --> 03:32:48,280
Of like... Oh, there you are.

3195
03:32:48,280 --> 03:32:49,040
Okay.

3196
03:32:52,740 --> 03:32:56,960
She has like no... What's the word when you like don't care...

3197
03:32:56,960 --> 03:32:58,960
If you live or die?

3198
03:33:00,040 --> 03:33:01,400
Self-preservation?

3199
03:33:01,800 --> 03:33:02,140
Maybe?

3200
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:05,720
Yeah, she has no sense of danger at all.

3201
03:33:19,300 --> 03:33:19,980
Okay.

3202
03:33:21,220 --> 03:33:23,420
The treehouse just sounded so enticing.

3203
03:33:24,560 --> 03:33:26,180
Of like a side mission, you know?

3204
03:33:27,320 --> 03:33:28,500
She's like a dodo.

3205
03:33:28,740 --> 03:33:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3206
03:33:34,310 --> 03:33:35,030
What's this?

3207
03:33:36,090 --> 03:33:36,850
Another recipe.

3208
03:33:38,410 --> 03:33:40,090
Remember to eat my dear nephew.

3209
03:33:40,770 --> 03:33:42,330
Your mind needs food to function.

3210
03:33:43,190 --> 03:33:45,110
This is how you prepare fish cakes.

3211
03:33:48,650 --> 03:33:51,110
Alright, if anybody wants to make fish cakes.

3212
03:33:57,490 --> 03:33:59,910
How is my stamina looking?

3213
03:34:04,300 --> 03:34:05,160
Cool.

3214
03:34:07,800 --> 03:34:09,300
Eat your fish cakes.

3215
03:34:22,680 --> 03:34:23,040
Pull!

3216
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:27,780
Yeah, Gina!

3217
03:34:34,540 --> 03:34:38,860
It won't help if you clip out of existence, Gina.

3218
03:34:39,720 --> 03:34:39,880
No!

3219
03:34:44,120 --> 03:34:45,360
You need to heal.

3220
03:34:48,780 --> 03:34:50,900
So why is it all boarded up anyway?

3221
03:35:12,360 --> 03:35:13,140
Oh no!

3222
03:35:16,020 --> 03:35:17,480
What is he going to do with the kids?

3223
03:35:23,620 --> 03:35:24,580
Well, you know.

3224
03:35:24,980 --> 03:35:26,740
That's on... We'll see.

3225
03:35:30,320 --> 03:35:31,140
We'll see.

3226
03:35:31,300 --> 03:35:34,720
If he is in one of those little camps...

3227
03:35:39,720 --> 03:35:42,740
He got himself into the mess, so...

3228
03:35:42,740 --> 03:35:45,180
Is it really my job to get it back?

3229
03:35:48,120 --> 03:35:49,900
This picture of him with his uncle.

3230
03:35:52,880 --> 03:35:53,360
1935

3231
03:36:01,960 --> 03:36:03,320
Can we go up?

3232
03:36:05,980 --> 03:36:06,460
Oh, you're right.

3233
03:36:09,820 --> 03:36:10,760
Let's check.

3234
03:36:13,360 --> 03:36:15,780
I missed the part where that's in the problem.

3235
03:36:17,400 --> 03:36:17,960
Exactly.

3236
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:19,680
Oh, hidden map.

3237
03:36:20,240 --> 03:36:24,760
If my theory is correct, there is another older temple buried beneath Wat Si Sawai.

3238
03:36:25,320 --> 03:36:29,660
Perhaps it was a test of courage for Khmer warriors.

3239
03:36:30,240 --> 03:36:32,120
And what if the old mechanisms still work?

3240
03:36:32,120 --> 03:36:36,340
I'm no warrior, but with all I learned at the university in Krung Thep...

3241
03:36:36,340 --> 03:36:39,080
I think I can figure out how some old traps work.

3242
03:36:39,560 --> 03:36:41,540
I've noted the possible location on the map.

3243
03:36:43,300 --> 03:36:44,300
Treehouse, ruins...

3244
03:36:44,300 --> 03:36:45,260
Mandapa...

3245
03:36:45,260 --> 03:36:49,580
I wonder what the Italian soldiers are doing near the treehouse.

3246
03:36:49,700 --> 03:36:51,260
I should ask them what they want.

3247
03:37:04,700 --> 03:37:05,580
Mmm, corn.

3248
03:37:20,740 --> 03:37:21,900
Ok, Gina.

3249
03:37:22,420 --> 03:37:26,020
She's like, you know when kids are trying to...

3250
03:37:26,020 --> 03:37:28,440
When they're like, mom, look what I can do.

3251
03:37:28,500 --> 03:37:30,000
I want to show you a cool trick.

3252
03:37:30,760 --> 03:37:35,020
And they like, it's just them flailing in the water or something.

3253
03:37:35,100 --> 03:37:36,160
Ok, now she's floating.

3254
03:37:36,660 --> 03:37:37,200
Ok, Gina.

3255
03:37:39,220 --> 03:37:41,520
Oh my god, what do you mean not far from here?

3256
03:37:43,340 --> 03:37:45,340
Indeed, that's pretty far.

3257
03:37:47,340 --> 03:37:49,240
Hold on tight, spider monkey.

3258
03:37:49,660 --> 03:37:50,060
For real.

3259
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:55,540
Witch!

3260
03:37:55,540 --> 03:37:56,080
Witch!

3261
03:38:02,410 --> 03:38:04,430
You've been here the whole time!

3262
03:38:06,710 --> 03:38:08,410
Girl, what are you saying?

3263
03:38:16,280 --> 03:38:19,440
I love how janky this game is, I'm not gonna lie.

3264
03:38:20,360 --> 03:38:22,520
It's just endless entertainment for me.

3265
03:38:23,780 --> 03:38:28,180
It's some of my favorite things is when a game is...

3266
03:38:31,900 --> 03:38:34,280
I know not everybody thinks that way.

3267
03:38:34,400 --> 03:38:38,060
They're just like, I paid good money and the game is...

3268
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:41,540
It's dumb, but I just...

3269
03:38:42,980 --> 03:38:44,220
Yeah, it's playable.

3270
03:38:44,420 --> 03:38:45,640
It's playable, exactly.

3271
03:38:47,020 --> 03:38:48,000
What the hell was that?

3272
03:38:49,640 --> 03:38:50,960
What was that?

3273
03:38:54,620 --> 03:38:55,180
Hello?

3274
03:38:59,430 --> 03:39:01,450
You think we're welcome here?

3275
03:39:02,090 --> 03:39:02,510
Sorry.

3276
03:39:04,870 --> 03:39:06,710
Nah, let's just go to our destination.

3277
03:39:18,140 --> 03:39:20,400
Sorry, I'm constantly needing to check.

3278
03:39:21,400 --> 03:39:23,320
These rivers kind of confuse me.

3279
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:33,560
Yeah, up and... Wait, is it up and around or do we go down this way?

3280
03:39:34,340 --> 03:39:35,640
Actually, I can't tell.

3281
03:39:36,980 --> 03:39:39,200
I can't tell if that's a river through there.

3282
03:39:42,020 --> 03:39:43,520
I can't tell.

3283
03:39:49,960 --> 03:39:52,700
Oh wait, but there's a shiny there.

3284
03:39:52,700 --> 03:39:55,640
Where they built by the people of Siam?

3285
03:40:03,400 --> 03:40:05,320
Looks like we can walk.

3286
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:07,040
Walk this way!

3287
03:40:09,800 --> 03:40:10,480
Nice.

3288
03:40:15,140 --> 03:40:15,900
Nice.

3289
03:40:28,320 --> 03:40:30,060
I see, I see.

3290
03:40:30,380 --> 03:40:31,460
What is this?

3291
03:40:32,900 --> 03:40:33,920
Delivery note.

3292
03:40:34,520 --> 03:40:36,640
I've secured a crate of grappa.

3293
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:42,020
As promised, tell the men we will have a get together after the shift is over.

3294
03:40:42,300 --> 03:40:44,100
I have planned some fun and games too.

3295
03:40:44,480 --> 03:40:47,120
It's important to keep morale up at times like this.

3296
03:40:47,620 --> 03:40:49,480
Fun and games!

3297
03:40:53,020 --> 03:40:54,380
Oh, that's a guy.

3298
03:40:56,520 --> 03:40:59,120
I don't really want to be sneaking around.

3299
03:41:00,080 --> 03:41:01,380
I'm not gonna lie.

3300
03:41:06,690 --> 03:41:09,350
I don't really want to be sneaking around.

3301
03:41:24,170 --> 03:41:28,670
I guess we don't have to sneak.

3302
03:41:30,750 --> 03:41:34,430
I guess if we do that, we don't have to sneak even a little bit.

3303
03:41:34,790 --> 03:41:35,670
Oh, this way.

3304
03:41:45,310 --> 03:41:47,690
Alright little guy, where is our nephew?

3305
03:41:48,590 --> 03:41:50,930
Ok, we are almost there.

3306
03:41:56,040 --> 03:41:56,840
Through here.

3307
03:42:00,660 --> 03:42:01,300
What's this?

3308
03:42:07,860 --> 03:42:10,420
Oh gosh, I have to find this kid.

3309
03:42:11,720 --> 03:42:13,120
Oh, he's a little dot.

3310
03:42:13,240 --> 03:42:14,180
Oh, enter the temple.

3311
03:42:14,320 --> 03:42:14,740
Just kidding.

3312
03:42:15,060 --> 03:42:16,000
He's not a little dot.

3313
03:42:19,120 --> 03:42:21,220
Oh, it does look like corn, doesn't it?

3314
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:24,540
I think this guy is gonna notice us.

3315
03:42:28,540 --> 03:42:29,840
Take a picture of what's this?

3316
03:42:29,840 --> 03:42:30,120
Hawaii?

3317
03:42:30,880 --> 03:42:31,260
Nice.

3318
03:42:34,680 --> 03:42:37,060
Actually, this one is better.

3319
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:39,760
Actually, this one is better.

3320
03:42:47,840 --> 03:42:50,620
I see at least five guys.

3321
03:42:51,040 --> 03:42:54,360
Every mission is a stealth mission if nobody is alive to report that they saw you.

3322
03:42:54,560 --> 03:42:55,540
That's what I'm saying.

3323
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:59,280
I did see the whip thing.

3324
03:42:59,380 --> 03:43:01,560
Oh my gosh, Gina, you scared the hell out of me.

3325
03:43:01,980 --> 03:43:04,280
I saw the whip thing, but I think it was just to go up.

3326
03:43:04,540 --> 03:43:05,900
I don't know if there was anything up there.

3327
03:43:16,160 --> 03:43:16,920
What's up here?

3328
03:43:20,140 --> 03:43:22,000
Gina, let's check this area out first.

3329
03:43:28,670 --> 03:43:30,150
There's more mallets too.

3330
03:43:31,390 --> 03:43:31,750
Perfect.

3331
03:43:34,130 --> 03:43:37,870
I think I can climb up this once the going gets tough.

3332
03:43:40,790 --> 03:43:42,190
There's three guys here.

3333
03:43:42,250 --> 03:43:44,070
I think I can take them down with the mallets.

3334
03:43:46,410 --> 03:43:46,850
Alright.

3335
03:43:48,830 --> 03:43:49,850
Oh, never mind.

3336
03:43:49,950 --> 03:43:50,370
Picture time.

3337
03:43:52,810 --> 03:43:54,010
Of this guy.

3338
03:43:55,370 --> 03:43:56,470
Paint... No, just kidding.

3339
03:43:56,590 --> 03:43:57,890
We don't care about him at all.

3340
03:43:58,730 --> 03:44:00,290
What am I painting message?

3341
03:44:00,490 --> 03:44:00,730
Oh!

3342
03:44:05,530 --> 03:44:06,130
2480!

3343
03:44:08,210 --> 03:44:09,670
What do you mean new mystery?

3344
03:44:10,050 --> 03:44:11,290
Path of Tigers!

3345
03:44:16,410 --> 03:44:17,010
Alright.

3346
03:44:17,210 --> 03:44:17,850
Oh, Gina.

3347
03:44:20,230 --> 03:44:21,410
Alright, guys.

3348
03:44:26,590 --> 03:44:29,270
We're gonna sneak up and take him out.

3349
03:44:34,740 --> 03:44:35,560
He's hungry.

3350
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:36,220
He won't notice.

3351
03:44:45,250 --> 03:44:46,570
Sweet dreams.

3352
03:44:47,090 --> 03:44:48,390
Sweet dreams!

3353
03:44:48,770 --> 03:44:50,350
Sweet dreams!

3354
03:44:52,650 --> 03:44:53,530
Oh,

3355
03:44:57,510 --> 03:44:58,350
Gina, don't do that.

3356
03:44:58,490 --> 03:44:58,750
What, Gina?

3357
03:45:00,570 --> 03:45:01,450
Gina?

3358
03:45:03,310 --> 03:45:06,750
Stop blocking!

3359
03:45:07,470 --> 03:45:08,290
Feeling woozy?

3360
03:45:08,290 --> 03:45:08,650
Yeah?

3361
03:45:12,950 --> 03:45:13,970
Feeling woozy?

3362
03:45:14,770 --> 03:45:15,450
That's right.

3363
03:45:16,150 --> 03:45:17,410
No, I don't want the body.

3364
03:45:17,490 --> 03:45:18,010
I want your weapon.

3365
03:45:19,690 --> 03:45:20,330
Nice!

3366
03:45:21,050 --> 03:45:23,590
Do you know with the distraction they were like...

3367
03:45:23,590 --> 03:45:23,810
Woman!

3368
03:45:24,250 --> 03:45:24,510
Woman!

3369
03:45:27,590 --> 03:45:28,230
Woman!

3370
03:45:31,350 --> 03:45:32,690
Good job, everybody.

3371
03:45:34,370 --> 03:45:35,010
Nice!

3372
03:45:35,750 --> 03:45:36,390
Mommy!

3373
03:45:39,170 --> 03:45:40,710
Anyone else around here?

3374
03:45:42,030 --> 03:45:43,110
Or did they all come running?

3375
03:45:48,380 --> 03:45:50,720
Oh, definitely more guys.

3376
03:45:57,720 --> 03:45:58,360
God,

3377
03:46:08,820 --> 03:46:09,740
that guy can take a hit.

3378
03:46:12,200 --> 03:46:13,040
Yeah, Gina.

3379
03:46:13,220 --> 03:46:13,880
Can't be seen!

3380
03:46:13,960 --> 03:46:14,540
Get down!

3381
03:46:16,680 --> 03:46:17,700
Anything in this?

3382
03:46:17,920 --> 03:46:18,240
No.

3383
03:46:25,290 --> 03:46:27,430
Good thing they didn't notice anything.

3384
03:46:31,890 --> 03:46:33,530
I hear even more guys.

3385
03:46:38,190 --> 03:46:40,590
I wish I had another...

3386
03:46:41,850 --> 03:46:43,950
I wish I had another sledgehammer.

3387
03:46:44,970 --> 03:46:46,590
Movies and video games have...

3388
03:46:47,590 --> 03:46:48,590
Really, wait...

3389
03:46:48,590 --> 03:46:50,710
Really have people way too into their job.

3390
03:46:50,790 --> 03:46:53,610
Like if I saw a dude with a sledgehammer attack my co-workers, I'm leaving.

3391
03:46:54,010 --> 03:46:54,290
Right!

3392
03:46:55,190 --> 03:46:56,130
It's true!

3393
03:46:58,410 --> 03:46:59,830
Definitely one of those like...

3394
03:46:59,830 --> 03:47:03,330
I don't think I get paid enough for this kind of moment.

3395
03:47:06,230 --> 03:47:09,510
Oh, I think he's down.

3396
03:47:18,330 --> 03:47:18,770
Damn.

3397
03:47:22,190 --> 03:47:23,190
What are you doing, Gina?

3398
03:47:26,450 --> 03:47:27,070
There we go.

3399
03:47:28,210 --> 03:47:29,250
Lights out, fella!

3400
03:47:30,350 --> 03:47:31,670
Wait, is there another person?

3401
03:47:32,190 --> 03:47:32,630
No.

3402
03:47:35,430 --> 03:47:36,410
What was I going to do?

3403
03:47:36,490 --> 03:47:38,470
I was going to eat some fruit.

3404
03:47:38,790 --> 03:47:40,190
And I'm going to steal all their fruit.

3405
03:47:43,490 --> 03:47:45,350
Where the hell are you going, Gina?

3406
03:47:49,270 --> 03:47:51,270
Just closed on buying a place.

3407
03:47:51,670 --> 03:47:52,830
I'm a homeowner now.

3408
03:47:53,170 --> 03:47:54,950
Can you bless it so it's not haunted?

3409
03:47:58,050 --> 03:47:58,650
Oh...

3410
03:47:59,550 --> 03:48:00,150
What?

3411
03:48:01,670 --> 03:48:04,310
Like you mean buy a different ghost, right?

3412
03:48:05,930 --> 03:48:10,110
You would want me to haunt your home, right?

3413
03:48:10,470 --> 03:48:10,930
Obviously.

3414
03:48:11,330 --> 03:48:12,470
Congrats, Cat Daddy!

3415
03:48:14,210 --> 03:48:16,950
You mean like buy a different ghost that's not...

3416
03:48:17,730 --> 03:48:18,790
Minto, though.

3417
03:48:19,230 --> 03:48:20,410
I get it, I get it.

3418
03:48:20,550 --> 03:48:21,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3419
03:48:24,950 --> 03:48:25,270
Right.

3420
03:48:27,790 --> 03:48:28,430
Obviously.

3421
03:48:28,650 --> 03:48:29,750
Yeah, obviously.

3422
03:48:37,510 --> 03:48:39,870
Gina's off having her own adventures again.

3423
03:48:40,890 --> 03:48:41,990
Where did she go?

3424
03:48:47,460 --> 03:48:48,920
No ghosts at all.

3425
03:48:52,920 --> 03:48:53,560
But...

3426
03:49:12,400 --> 03:49:14,660
That means you don't want me...

3427
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:21,480
You don't want me in your house...

3428
03:49:21,480 --> 03:49:24,080
Haunting your house and eating your food.

3429
03:49:25,660 --> 03:49:27,360
And you don't...

3430
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:34,260
You don't want me moving your cups and drawers at night.

3431
03:49:36,700 --> 03:49:38,800
And you don't want me...

3432
03:49:38,800 --> 03:49:39,920
You don't want me...

3433
03:49:40,540 --> 03:49:42,060
You don't want me...

3434
03:49:42,060 --> 03:49:43,740
You know, pulling off your blanket.

3435
03:49:48,460 --> 03:49:51,020
Or knocking on your doors.

3436
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:53,540
I missed the part where that's my problem.

3437
03:50:00,220 --> 03:50:00,740
No!

3438
03:50:07,450 --> 03:50:09,250
Maybe I shouldn't have run in.

3439
03:50:09,890 --> 03:50:12,850
Maybe I should have taken the...

3440
03:50:17,040 --> 03:50:18,820
Maybe I should have taken the ladder.

3441
03:50:20,600 --> 03:50:21,040
Oops.

3442
03:50:25,120 --> 03:50:25,640
Oopsie.

3443
03:50:30,470 --> 03:50:32,310
You think there's gonna be guys in here?

3444
03:50:32,730 --> 03:50:33,250
Oh, a book.

3445
03:50:34,030 --> 03:50:34,550
Handyman.

3446
03:50:36,070 --> 03:50:38,170
Increases durability of melee weapons.

3447
03:50:38,230 --> 03:50:38,970
That's huge.

3448
03:50:39,650 --> 03:50:40,730
That's huge.

3449
03:50:41,910 --> 03:50:43,530
And... I thought that was a hand.

3450
03:50:43,710 --> 03:50:44,510
Oh, it is a hand.

3451
03:50:44,630 --> 03:50:45,030
Just kidding.

3452
03:50:49,990 --> 03:50:50,970
Iron grip.

3453
03:50:51,870 --> 03:50:52,990
More iron grip.

3454
03:50:53,710 --> 03:50:56,130
I never really clinch the enemies anyway, but you know.

3455
03:50:57,110 --> 03:50:57,650
Handyman.

3456
03:50:59,590 --> 03:51:01,790
I leave all my drawers and cabinets open.

3457
03:51:01,790 --> 03:51:05,170
I also keep all interior doors closed and have no mirrors.

3458
03:51:11,430 --> 03:51:13,670
We need a... We need a weapon.

3459
03:51:14,050 --> 03:51:15,050
We need a melee weapon.

3460
03:51:15,390 --> 03:51:16,150
Maybe this will work.

3461
03:51:21,590 --> 03:51:22,670
Just kidding.

3462
03:51:23,110 --> 03:51:24,150
That didn't work.

3463
03:51:32,150 --> 03:51:35,130
Maybe a rite of passage for Khmer warriors.

3464
03:51:35,830 --> 03:51:36,070
Wait.

3465
03:51:36,310 --> 03:51:37,270
That's not one either.

3466
03:51:37,450 --> 03:51:37,650
Dang.

3467
03:51:40,570 --> 03:51:42,530
Yeah, your name is Binary Ghost.

3468
03:51:42,650 --> 03:51:43,390
Are you not a ghost?

3469
03:51:55,510 --> 03:51:56,730
We found them.

3470
03:51:58,610 --> 03:51:59,170
You're in here?

3471
03:52:09,270 --> 03:52:10,070
I do.

3472
03:52:10,810 --> 03:52:12,310
Very good English.

3473
03:52:13,270 --> 03:52:14,170
I'm Gina.

3474
03:52:14,930 --> 03:52:16,430
This is Indiana Jones.

3475
03:52:17,170 --> 03:52:18,930
Sunan sent us to help you.

3476
03:52:19,810 --> 03:52:21,250
Oh, thank you.

3477
03:52:21,950 --> 03:52:24,590
The foreign soldier forced me to show them what I found.

3478
03:52:25,290 --> 03:52:26,430
Now I'm trapped in here.

3479
03:52:26,610 --> 03:52:27,410
That's so sad.

3480
03:52:28,750 --> 03:52:29,510
It's alright.

3481
03:52:30,330 --> 03:52:31,810
We'll find a way to reach you.

3482
03:52:32,290 --> 03:52:32,390
Yeah.

3483
03:52:33,250 --> 03:52:33,910
Let's go, Jones.

3484
03:52:34,690 --> 03:52:35,750
Stay out of trouble, kid.

3485
03:52:36,390 --> 03:52:39,010
I think we could probably move it.

3486
03:52:40,890 --> 03:52:42,530
I think we can move the rocks, Gina.

3487
03:52:42,830 --> 03:52:43,630
Be careful.

3488
03:52:46,370 --> 03:52:47,830
I think we can move the rocks, Gina.

3489
03:52:47,890 --> 03:52:49,650
I think we are strong.

3490
03:52:51,730 --> 03:52:53,750
OK, we need...

3491
03:52:58,730 --> 03:52:59,170
Sorry.

3492
03:53:01,030 --> 03:53:02,870
We need a little...

3493
03:53:02,870 --> 03:53:04,570
Little knob.

3494
03:53:04,930 --> 03:53:05,470
Oh wait!

3495
03:53:06,170 --> 03:53:07,670
This looks like we could turn it.

3496
03:53:08,410 --> 03:53:08,710
No?

3497
03:53:09,090 --> 03:53:09,590
Just kidding.

3498
03:53:10,490 --> 03:53:11,190
We need the car.

3499
03:53:12,290 --> 03:53:13,070
That's what I said!

3500
03:53:16,290 --> 03:53:17,330
Do it!

3501
03:53:18,350 --> 03:53:18,510
Oh.

3502
03:53:18,950 --> 03:53:19,170
OK.

3503
03:53:27,190 --> 03:53:27,710
No.

3504
03:53:27,710 --> 03:53:28,230
OK.

3505
03:53:28,470 --> 03:53:29,430
You do that handle.

3506
03:53:29,590 --> 03:53:31,270
I'll get the closer handle.

3507
03:53:31,270 --> 03:53:32,430
This one.

3508
03:53:33,330 --> 03:53:34,030
Alright, ready?

3509
03:53:36,190 --> 03:53:36,490
OK.

3510
03:53:48,080 --> 03:53:49,400
OK.

3511
03:53:53,960 --> 03:53:55,040
Pipe segment.

3512
03:53:57,040 --> 03:53:57,420
OK.

3513
03:53:59,920 --> 03:54:01,900
What the hell is that?

3514
03:54:06,420 --> 03:54:06,940
OK.

3515
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:10,660
I don't...Are we going down?

3516
03:54:11,220 --> 03:54:13,900
I don't really like...I don't like...

3517
03:54:14,420 --> 03:54:15,300
Oh wait for Gina.

3518
03:54:15,500 --> 03:54:15,860
Oh sorry.

3519
03:54:17,260 --> 03:54:17,980
Oh god!

3520
03:54:18,320 --> 03:54:18,560
OK.

3521
03:54:18,880 --> 03:54:19,380
Let's go.

3522
03:54:34,320 --> 03:54:34,800
Where?

3523
03:54:37,380 --> 03:54:38,460
Where the hell are you?

3524
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:43,220
Where the hell are you?

3525
03:54:45,240 --> 03:54:47,520
I hear him, but I don't see him at all.

3526
03:54:47,660 --> 03:54:48,380
Oh there he is.

3527
03:54:49,720 --> 03:54:50,200
Jump!

3528
03:54:50,680 --> 03:54:51,740
Just jump down.

3529
03:54:53,920 --> 03:54:54,820
Jump down.

3530
03:54:55,000 --> 03:54:55,520
You'll make it.

3531
03:54:57,240 --> 03:55:00,880
We have to find a way to lift the platform.

3532
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:01,500
Got it.

3533
03:55:01,640 --> 03:55:02,360
Oh my goodness.

3534
03:55:02,520 --> 03:55:03,940
This place is kind of huge.

3535
03:55:08,330 --> 03:55:08,850
OK.

3536
03:55:11,230 --> 03:55:12,190
Big gears.

3537
03:55:20,910 --> 03:55:22,390
Can I go up here?

3538
03:55:27,170 --> 03:55:28,170
Can I not go up here?

3539
03:55:30,390 --> 03:55:30,910
OK.

3540
03:55:31,990 --> 03:55:33,790
I'm just getting lost at this point.

3541
03:55:35,930 --> 03:55:37,730
It looks like I can go up there though.

3542
03:55:40,750 --> 03:55:43,090
I nearly got soft locked here.

3543
03:55:43,290 --> 03:55:43,870
Oh you see?

3544
03:55:47,090 --> 03:55:48,330
Don't scare me.

3545
03:55:49,050 --> 03:55:50,350
It's impossible to get through.

3546
03:55:50,850 --> 03:55:51,830
At least for now.

3547
03:55:55,870 --> 03:55:56,750
Oh gosh.

3548
03:55:57,590 --> 03:55:58,930
There is a lot going on here.

3549
03:55:59,930 --> 03:56:00,190
OK.

3550
03:56:00,250 --> 03:56:01,430
I'm just going to keep walking around.

3551
03:56:10,590 --> 03:56:15,190
The only Indiana Jones movie I ever watched was the Crystal Skull.

3552
03:56:16,750 --> 03:56:17,150
Wow.

3553
03:56:17,350 --> 03:56:20,790
Tell me you don't watch membership streams without telling me you don't watch them.

3554
03:56:20,810 --> 03:56:21,210
I'm just kidding.

3555
03:56:25,950 --> 03:56:26,950
Hot dog gacha.

3556
03:56:38,480 --> 03:56:39,280
There is?

3557
03:56:39,440 --> 03:56:39,880
Oh my gosh.

3558
03:56:39,960 --> 03:56:40,220
Thank you.

3559
03:56:40,560 --> 03:56:40,960
Gina?

3560
03:56:41,560 --> 03:56:41,960
Where?

3561
03:56:42,280 --> 03:56:42,600
Oh wait.

3562
03:56:42,720 --> 03:56:43,060
Here?

3563
03:56:46,500 --> 03:56:47,420
Why is it saving?

3564
03:56:48,980 --> 03:56:50,380
Here?

3565
03:56:54,700 --> 03:56:56,100
Minky?

3566
03:57:01,670 --> 03:57:05,530
Gina's backseating actually helps for once.

3567
03:57:08,950 --> 03:57:10,890
Oh my gosh.

3568
03:57:11,830 --> 03:57:14,370
Are you OK over there?

3569
03:57:14,370 --> 03:57:14,450
Over there?

3570
03:57:17,950 --> 03:57:19,310
Oh god.

3571
03:57:22,910 --> 03:57:25,590
I think I just panic jumped.

3572
03:57:36,110 --> 03:57:39,070
I didn't know what to expect.

3573
03:57:39,630 --> 03:57:39,810
OK.

3574
03:57:39,910 --> 03:57:40,090
Wait.

3575
03:57:40,470 --> 03:57:41,810
Do I have to go to the other side?

3576
03:57:43,950 --> 03:57:44,630
Yes.

3577
03:57:44,810 --> 03:57:45,150
OK.

3578
03:57:48,350 --> 03:57:49,110
It's fine.

3579
03:57:55,790 --> 03:57:57,230
Did she make it?

3580
03:57:57,410 --> 03:57:57,870
Oh she did.

3581
03:57:59,230 --> 03:57:59,770
Oh OK.

3582
03:57:59,870 --> 03:58:01,430
I guess I'm the only fat ass here.

3583
03:58:01,770 --> 03:58:02,250
Wow.

3584
03:58:02,670 --> 03:58:03,850
This is so messed up.

3585
03:58:22,110 --> 03:58:26,970
Yes, but also...shouldn't it be...going...wait.

3586
03:58:27,070 --> 03:58:27,450
Hold on.

3587
03:58:29,650 --> 03:58:31,030
If we turn this...

3588
03:58:35,150 --> 03:58:35,590
OK.

3589
03:58:37,590 --> 03:58:38,530
But what about this one?

3590
03:58:38,590 --> 03:58:40,590
This is the one to...

3591
03:58:42,090 --> 03:58:42,890
Do something.

3592
03:58:43,950 --> 03:58:44,330
Hold on.

3593
03:58:44,370 --> 03:58:45,470
I see the picture thing.

3594
03:58:45,610 --> 03:58:46,310
Before I forget.

3595
03:58:46,310 --> 03:58:50,210
Before I forget...oh giant cog wheels.

3596
03:58:59,400 --> 03:59:00,640
Oh wait for Gina.

3597
03:59:01,140 --> 03:59:01,340
OK.

3598
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:02,500
Gina?

3599
03:59:04,940 --> 03:59:06,220
I'm waiting for you.

3600
03:59:07,340 --> 03:59:07,800
Gina?

3601
03:59:09,000 --> 03:59:09,300
OK.

3602
03:59:09,440 --> 03:59:09,760
Here we go.

3603
03:59:11,680 --> 03:59:12,400
What are we doing?

3604
03:59:13,220 --> 03:59:14,120
Oh we're just moving it?

3605
03:59:14,220 --> 03:59:14,420
OK.

3606
03:59:16,360 --> 03:59:16,920
That's it?

3607
03:59:18,140 --> 03:59:18,700
OK.

3608
03:59:18,820 --> 03:59:19,920
And then...

3609
03:59:21,620 --> 03:59:25,000
When we're ready for this one, we'll do it.

3610
03:59:30,620 --> 03:59:31,180
Now,

3611
03:59:34,840 --> 03:59:36,840
we take you.

3612
03:59:37,340 --> 03:59:37,600
Drop.

3613
03:59:38,600 --> 03:59:39,540
Do I have to turn it off?

3614
03:59:39,820 --> 03:59:40,100
No.

3615
03:59:40,260 --> 03:59:40,440
OK.

3616
03:59:40,460 --> 03:59:40,960
It doesn't matter.

3617
03:59:43,520 --> 03:59:44,520
Take that.

3618
03:59:44,900 --> 03:59:45,920
Put you here.

3619
03:59:46,920 --> 03:59:48,580
Facing east.

3620
03:59:49,480 --> 03:59:55,660
And put you...facing...I don't know actually.

3621
03:59:56,400 --> 03:59:56,560
No.

3622
03:59:57,020 --> 04:00:00,320
Place you facing west.

3623
04:00:01,360 --> 04:00:05,920
And pull!

3624
04:00:08,860 --> 04:00:10,540
Let's try this.

3625
04:00:10,660 --> 04:00:11,440
Let's try this.

3626
04:00:17,700 --> 04:00:18,220
OK!

3627
04:00:20,780 --> 04:00:21,240
Pull!

3628
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:28,080
One moment.

3629
04:00:29,120 --> 04:00:29,920
There we go.

3630
04:00:30,540 --> 04:00:30,860
OK.

3631
04:00:31,560 --> 04:00:32,020
Very good.

3632
04:00:32,900 --> 04:00:33,380
Oh god.

3633
04:00:34,340 --> 04:00:35,360
That'll kill you.

3634
04:00:37,460 --> 04:00:38,260
Gina where did you go?

3635
04:00:38,560 --> 04:00:39,360
Gina where did you go?

3636
04:00:42,260 --> 04:00:43,880
I think she's dead now everybody.

3637
04:00:51,200 --> 04:00:52,360
Very good.

3638
04:00:53,480 --> 04:00:54,660
I think we climb up there.

3639
04:00:58,900 --> 04:01:00,080
And climb.

3640
04:01:00,860 --> 04:01:02,040
She got crushed.

3641
04:01:09,080 --> 04:01:10,480
Where are you?

3642
04:01:12,680 --> 04:01:13,260
Oh.

3643
04:01:14,840 --> 04:01:15,900
You're over there.

3644
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:16,920
You didn't even come through.

3645
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:17,900
You coward Gina.

3646
04:01:18,840 --> 04:01:19,580
Stupid Gina.

3647
04:01:19,800 --> 04:01:20,440
Stupid coward.

3648
04:01:25,100 --> 04:01:27,340
I hate the way it pushes me back.

3649
04:01:36,080 --> 04:01:36,840
I'm fine!

3650
04:01:44,780 --> 04:01:49,200
He has Indy's angry voice down so well.

3651
04:01:51,280 --> 04:01:53,040
Do you think I can make this?

3652
04:01:56,700 --> 04:01:58,060
I'm too good.

3653
04:01:58,900 --> 04:02:00,080
I'm too good.

3654
04:02:00,700 --> 04:02:03,620
Where was the one that allowed my...

3655
04:02:10,920 --> 04:02:11,760
Nice.

3656
04:02:18,390 --> 04:02:18,970
OK.

3657
04:02:19,070 --> 04:02:21,490
I was going to say this isn't getting closer to us is it?

3658
04:02:22,030 --> 04:02:24,270
We can't crawl underneath this can we?

3659
04:02:24,470 --> 04:02:24,930
Oh we can.

3660
04:02:26,650 --> 04:02:27,230
Perfect.

3661
04:02:30,190 --> 04:02:32,890
Troy Baker sounds more like Harrison Ford than Harrison Ford.

3662
04:02:34,030 --> 04:02:36,010
He's just old now.

3663
04:02:37,850 --> 04:02:39,630
It's not his fault.

3664
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:45,350
He's an old man.

3665
04:02:45,350 --> 04:02:47,350
Oh I thought...what is this?

3666
04:02:51,050 --> 04:02:51,750
Oh.

3667
04:02:52,110 --> 04:02:52,790
Interesting.

3668
04:02:55,330 --> 04:02:55,790
Yes!

3669
04:03:26,960 --> 04:03:30,280
Oh my God!

3670
04:03:33,960 --> 04:03:36,020
Oh my God!

3671
04:03:44,110 --> 04:03:48,450
I can't believe...at least we're not actually on fire.

3672
04:03:49,530 --> 04:03:55,330
It reminds me of when you accidentally set yourself...or maybe not accidentally...

3673
04:03:55,330 --> 04:04:01,690
but when you set yourself on fire in Red Dead Redemption and then in the cutscenes...

3674
04:04:01,690 --> 04:04:03,970
just like their skin is melting off.

3675
04:04:05,490 --> 04:04:06,430
Oh my God.

3676
04:04:06,430 --> 04:04:08,730
That was so stupid.

3677
04:04:09,730 --> 04:04:10,570
Alright Gina.

3678
04:04:11,410 --> 04:04:12,050
You need help?

3679
04:04:13,290 --> 04:04:14,230
She's got this.

3680
04:04:16,110 --> 04:04:18,950
I can't...that was so silly.

3681
04:04:28,110 --> 04:04:29,850
So silly!

3682
04:04:29,850 --> 04:04:30,010
Silly!

3683
04:04:34,450 --> 04:04:38,110
There's no where for my...

3684
04:04:38,850 --> 04:04:40,250
for my thingy.

3685
04:04:40,390 --> 04:04:40,970
My whip.

3686
04:04:48,420 --> 04:04:50,680
Oh we just activated the trap.

3687
04:04:54,240 --> 04:04:55,600
Don't touch that Gina.

3688
04:04:55,880 --> 04:04:56,680
Oh just kidding.

3689
04:04:57,720 --> 04:04:58,980
Maybe it's fine actually.

3690
04:04:59,890 --> 04:05:00,260
Oh.

3691
04:05:01,000 --> 04:05:01,740
Okay.

3692
04:05:02,820 --> 04:05:04,440
I guess it's fine.

3693
04:05:06,700 --> 04:05:07,580
Hold on.

3694
04:05:07,600 --> 04:05:08,640
I want to check up here real quick.

3695
04:05:18,750 --> 04:05:20,420
I'm taking your bread.

3696
04:05:21,640 --> 04:05:25,160
Milk tea bread sounds amazing.

3697
04:05:26,240 --> 04:05:28,000
I would like to eat that.

3698
04:05:30,340 --> 04:05:31,840
Sounds so good.

3699
04:05:46,330 --> 04:05:50,850
I thought we were...oh pipe puzzle big!

3700
04:05:51,770 --> 04:05:53,850
I thought we were in the main room.

3701
04:05:54,610 --> 04:05:55,910
Bridge with a statue.

3702
04:06:00,770 --> 04:06:01,290
Okay.

3703
04:06:01,450 --> 04:06:02,470
I see one up there.

3704
04:06:03,390 --> 04:06:03,850
Alright.

3705
04:06:04,050 --> 04:06:05,550
Let's find all the pipe pieces.

3706
04:06:06,570 --> 04:06:07,410
Put them all together.

3707
04:06:10,690 --> 04:06:12,490
I'm Indiana Jones in the circle.

3708
04:06:14,970 --> 04:06:17,190
Where are you?

3709
04:06:19,750 --> 04:06:21,770
He's gonna activate the traps or something.

3710
04:06:21,910 --> 04:06:23,290
Or we're gonna activate the traps.

3711
04:06:23,990 --> 04:06:26,230
Something's gonna...the traps are gonna get activated.

3712
04:06:26,510 --> 04:06:27,170
We know this.

3713
04:06:27,870 --> 04:06:28,450
Somehow.

3714
04:06:31,940 --> 04:06:33,770
I'm so glad that's durable.

3715
04:06:37,310 --> 04:06:40,430
Cody, I read that as circle of mid at first.

3716
04:06:42,130 --> 04:06:44,070
I was like oh okay.

3717
04:06:44,950 --> 04:06:45,850
Now I understand.

3718
04:06:46,510 --> 04:06:47,330
Circle of mid.

3719
04:06:49,510 --> 04:06:50,070
Okay,

3720
04:06:54,690 --> 04:06:55,510
so we have two.

3721
04:06:56,790 --> 04:06:57,790
Is that it?

3722
04:06:58,290 --> 04:06:59,230
Is that it for up here?

3723
04:07:00,390 --> 04:07:01,230
I guess so.

3724
04:07:01,990 --> 04:07:02,930
What the hell is that?

3725
04:07:04,550 --> 04:07:05,570
Ancient spear.

3726
04:07:11,320 --> 04:07:12,380
What's down here?

3727
04:07:18,840 --> 04:07:21,340
Don't catch yourself on fire this time now, Indy.

3728
04:07:24,660 --> 04:07:25,500
Okay.

3729
04:07:28,880 --> 04:07:30,780
I'm just gonna steal this.

3730
04:07:32,840 --> 04:07:34,940
Well, actually, yeah.

3731
04:07:35,140 --> 04:07:36,220
I'm gonna steal it.

3732
04:07:40,290 --> 04:07:41,130
Okay.

3733
04:07:42,790 --> 04:07:43,810
Traps in this game?

3734
04:07:43,910 --> 04:07:44,410
Nonsense.

3735
04:07:46,850 --> 04:07:48,710
That'd be your stupid silly.

3736
04:07:50,130 --> 04:07:52,850
Okay, let's go to the other side too.

3737
04:07:55,890 --> 04:07:57,890
Oh, maybe that's what we need to open up.

3738
04:08:00,630 --> 04:08:02,530
My oshi made mid phantom.

3739
04:08:07,410 --> 04:08:09,110
Where does the water come from?

3740
04:08:16,780 --> 04:08:17,620
Where is the water?

3741
04:08:18,500 --> 04:08:19,840
Where do we get the water?

3742
04:08:20,840 --> 04:08:23,740
Oh, look at that.

3743
04:08:25,760 --> 04:08:27,160
Where?

3744
04:08:31,240 --> 04:08:31,620
Where?

3745
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:37,040
Near the entrance.

3746
04:08:41,580 --> 04:08:42,980
Right.

3747
04:08:45,400 --> 04:08:45,880
Right.

3748
04:08:48,220 --> 04:08:50,980
I need to know which way they are flowing first though.

3749
04:08:52,040 --> 04:08:52,520
Right?

3750
04:08:52,740 --> 04:08:55,180
Like I can't just put in pipes and not know anything.

3751
04:08:57,400 --> 04:08:59,980
I don't see a...

3752
04:09:01,320 --> 04:09:05,220
Even a place to put the little staff that we got.

3753
04:09:05,380 --> 04:09:06,560
I don't see a place for it.

3754
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:10,220
Follow the water sound.

3755
04:09:10,900 --> 04:09:11,460
This one?

3756
04:09:13,580 --> 04:09:18,300
The one that leads to nowhere.

3757
04:09:21,620 --> 04:09:23,280
Oh, I see it.

3758
04:09:26,260 --> 04:09:27,800
Good thing this is sturdy.

3759
04:09:28,100 --> 04:09:28,700
My god.

3760
04:09:30,700 --> 04:09:31,980
Or I'm assuming this is it.

3761
04:09:32,720 --> 04:09:33,240
Okay.

3762
04:09:40,180 --> 04:09:40,180
Alrighty.

3763
04:09:40,760 --> 04:09:41,020
Cool.

3764
04:09:42,280 --> 04:09:44,940
So water goes down.

3765
04:09:47,100 --> 04:09:49,080
Go to here.

3766
04:09:50,080 --> 04:09:52,040
We need to go to...

3767
04:09:54,420 --> 04:09:54,920
Here?

3768
04:10:02,920 --> 04:10:03,620
Please.

3769
04:10:06,920 --> 04:10:07,620
Please.

3770
04:10:11,900 --> 04:10:12,600
Please!

3771
04:10:16,160 --> 04:10:16,920
Ah...

3772
04:10:19,590 --> 04:10:20,350
Please!

3773
04:10:23,610 --> 04:10:24,370
Please!

3774
04:10:27,330 --> 04:10:28,090
Okay.

3775
04:10:29,450 --> 04:10:31,130
Yes, you can go there.

3776
04:10:31,270 --> 04:10:32,410
And then you...

3777
04:10:35,150 --> 04:10:37,810
You can go here.

3778
04:10:38,810 --> 04:10:39,590
Ah, nope.

3779
04:10:40,050 --> 04:10:42,430
You can go here.

3780
04:10:45,490 --> 04:10:46,770
Oh, oops.

3781
04:10:47,250 --> 04:10:47,770
The wrong one.

3782
04:10:48,870 --> 04:10:50,050
You can go here.

3783
04:10:52,050 --> 04:10:53,410
Okay, we got it open.

3784
04:10:54,190 --> 04:10:54,590
Alright.

3785
04:10:57,570 --> 04:10:58,250
Yep.

3786
04:10:59,110 --> 04:11:00,370
Oh, it's this thing again.

3787
04:11:00,670 --> 04:11:00,970
Run!

3788
04:11:02,510 --> 04:11:02,930
Steal.

3789
04:11:05,070 --> 04:11:06,210
I'm trapped.

3790
04:11:09,210 --> 04:11:09,890
Okay.

3791
04:11:09,890 --> 04:11:10,570
And...

3792
04:11:10,570 --> 04:11:11,450
Go!

3793
04:11:15,410 --> 04:11:17,310
Now, which one are we trying to open now?

3794
04:11:20,870 --> 04:11:24,110
Trying to open...

3795
04:11:24,930 --> 04:11:27,830
Maybe like the three of these, I imagine.

3796
04:11:28,830 --> 04:11:29,990
That's probably the case.

3797
04:11:31,990 --> 04:11:32,670
So...

3798
04:11:32,670 --> 04:11:36,610
We have to direct this to...

3799
04:11:38,510 --> 04:11:39,190
Oh no!

3800
04:11:43,850 --> 04:11:46,020
Uh-oh.

3801
04:11:46,240 --> 04:11:49,100
Okay, we might have to finish this puzzle and then call it a day for now.

3802
04:11:51,000 --> 04:11:52,840
Maybe I'll finish this puzzle and then call it a day.

3803
04:11:59,980 --> 04:12:01,880
So this one...

3804
04:12:04,140 --> 04:12:06,120
Needs to go...

3805
04:12:06,120 --> 04:12:07,040
Not here.

3806
04:12:07,220 --> 04:12:07,800
Oh, here.

3807
04:12:08,500 --> 04:12:09,140
Through here.

3808
04:12:14,740 --> 04:12:15,660
Right.

3809
04:12:17,740 --> 04:12:18,740
And forward.

3810
04:12:19,200 --> 04:12:22,420
Do we have a power cable?

3811
04:12:24,100 --> 04:12:25,740
Probably somewhere.

3812
04:12:29,980 --> 04:12:30,440
Actually...

3813
04:12:31,320 --> 04:12:33,800
Oh wait, actually this one might be long enough.

3814
04:12:33,800 --> 04:12:34,800
Hold on.

3815
04:12:37,060 --> 04:12:38,320
Unplug it from my Switch.

3816
04:13:15,760 --> 04:13:16,060
Yeah.

3817
04:13:17,360 --> 04:13:21,860
Mii Phantom, you need a controller for this game.

3818
04:13:22,740 --> 04:13:23,420
I know.

3819
04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:30,420
Yeah, I know.

3820
04:13:34,260 --> 04:13:35,320
Okay, hold on.

3821
04:13:35,340 --> 04:13:35,700
Let's see.

3822
04:13:36,340 --> 04:13:37,840
So we need this area.

3823
04:13:45,960 --> 04:13:47,240
Maybe I can drop here.

3824
04:13:47,840 --> 04:13:48,640
Like so.

3825
04:13:49,480 --> 04:13:49,900
Okay.

3826
04:13:52,020 --> 04:13:55,460
Can this one be...

3827
04:13:58,500 --> 04:14:01,920
I only have curvy ones left.

3828
04:14:03,360 --> 04:14:04,900
What did I do with my straight one?

3829
04:14:07,240 --> 04:14:10,060
Oh, I had it... What did I do with the straight one?

3830
04:14:10,640 --> 04:14:11,380
I can't remember.

3831
04:14:17,010 --> 04:14:19,190
Oh yeah, now it's not going to this one.

3832
04:14:22,350 --> 04:14:23,230
Okay, hold on.

3833
04:14:23,370 --> 04:14:27,390
I wish I could zoom out and see this from a bird's eye view.

3834
04:14:27,950 --> 04:14:30,310
I guess I can go up here and look at it.

3835
04:14:30,390 --> 04:14:31,030
Let's try that.

3836
04:14:32,990 --> 04:14:34,430
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

3837
04:14:39,110 --> 04:14:40,190
Okay, here we go.

3838
04:14:42,110 --> 04:14:44,350
So we needed to go...

3839
04:14:44,350 --> 04:14:45,130
It

3840
04:14:50,630 --> 04:14:53,130
has to go through this one.

3841
04:14:53,510 --> 04:14:55,630
Like it absolutely has to go through this one.

3842
04:14:56,490 --> 04:14:56,970
100%.

3843
04:15:07,340 --> 04:15:09,780
I got stuck on this puzzle for way too long.

3844
04:15:11,120 --> 04:15:11,820
Oh, is Doki here?

3845
04:15:12,280 --> 04:15:12,560
Hi!

3846
04:15:15,240 --> 04:15:16,840
Oh, how was Bellatro?

3847
04:15:18,040 --> 04:15:19,120
Did Doki like it?

3848
04:15:24,580 --> 04:15:27,060
This one, we kind of ignore this.

3849
04:15:27,560 --> 04:15:29,700
Actually, I don't even think we can place anything on this one.

3850
04:15:39,450 --> 04:15:42,550
She did one run and went to play Marble Run.

3851
04:15:43,210 --> 04:15:43,970
No way.

3852
04:15:45,370 --> 04:15:47,330
She got really lucky number 7.

3853
04:15:47,490 --> 04:15:49,910
I don't know anything about Bellatro, so that means nothing to me.

3854
04:16:00,770 --> 04:16:01,590
Let's see.

3855
04:16:02,370 --> 04:16:04,570
I'm currently trying to use my brain.

3856
04:16:06,590 --> 04:16:08,630
I have to use my brain.

3857
04:16:16,720 --> 04:16:18,760
How am I supposed to...

3858
04:16:23,700 --> 04:16:24,420
3...

3859
04:16:40,180 --> 04:16:45,400
Technically, we can have this one curve into here, I think.

3860
04:16:47,260 --> 04:16:48,340
I think.

3861
04:16:49,660 --> 04:16:51,980
So we'll have that curve into there.

3862
04:16:53,680 --> 04:16:57,480
Or, I mean, right?

3863
04:16:58,160 --> 04:16:58,160
Wait.

3864
04:17:02,180 --> 04:17:07,560
I'm just going to place that, since I believe that to be correct.

3865
04:17:09,120 --> 04:17:09,640
No.

3866
04:17:12,520 --> 04:17:12,920
No.

3867
04:17:15,320 --> 04:17:15,800
No!

3868
04:17:18,060 --> 04:17:19,480
There we go.

3869
04:17:21,140 --> 04:17:21,620
OK.

3870
04:17:28,340 --> 04:17:30,200
How do I hot dog?

3871
04:17:31,040 --> 04:17:32,220
Also, distraction successful.

3872
04:17:34,340 --> 04:17:35,320
It's a gotcha.

3873
04:17:35,480 --> 04:17:36,840
The hot dog is a gotcha.

3874
04:17:41,470 --> 04:17:43,950
I feel like I'm missing a pipe, right?

3875
04:17:44,230 --> 04:17:45,730
But he said this is all I got.

3876
04:17:45,830 --> 04:17:46,550
This is all I need.

3877
04:17:50,570 --> 04:17:53,450
Maybe this one is not straight here.

3878
04:17:54,290 --> 04:17:55,590
This one is straight here.

3879
04:17:56,390 --> 04:17:56,910
Oh, OK.

3880
04:18:00,990 --> 04:18:03,550
And then, somehow...

3881
04:18:12,180 --> 04:18:14,480
Let's see, there's no water going to...

3882
04:18:17,920 --> 04:18:21,000
There's no water going to this one at all, which makes it difficult.

3883
04:18:24,200 --> 04:18:25,100
Thanks for that.

3884
04:18:25,360 --> 04:18:26,440
Hot dog!

3885
04:18:38,700 --> 04:18:39,340
What the?

3886
04:18:39,500 --> 04:18:40,180
What's pushing me?

3887
04:18:41,260 --> 04:18:42,580
What was pushing me?

3888
04:18:42,920 --> 04:18:43,560
That was weird.

3889
04:18:45,460 --> 04:18:47,420
Water doesn't have to come from the start?

3890
04:18:49,020 --> 04:18:50,940
There's other places the water can come from?

3891
04:18:58,940 --> 04:18:59,440
Or...

3892
04:18:59,440 --> 04:19:01,440
There's no...

3893
04:19:02,460 --> 04:19:05,440
way to direct water into...

3894
04:19:06,440 --> 04:19:08,080
to the left.

3895
04:19:10,200 --> 04:19:13,140
Can I get a feel better soon breed?

3896
04:19:13,360 --> 04:19:14,040
I just got skinned.

3897
04:19:14,140 --> 04:19:15,600
Cancel an event such as artist alias.

3898
04:19:15,760 --> 04:19:17,160
But 2K, oh no!

3899
04:19:17,980 --> 04:19:19,200
No breed!

3900
04:19:20,000 --> 04:19:21,320
Get better soon!

3901
04:19:22,520 --> 04:19:24,020
Feel better beam!

3902
04:19:26,820 --> 04:19:28,320
Feel better beam!

3903
04:19:39,780 --> 04:19:41,040
Wait a second.

3904
04:19:42,600 --> 04:19:45,260
If I take this...

3905
04:19:45,260 --> 04:19:47,060
and make it go straight...

3906
04:19:48,800 --> 04:19:49,200
Nope.

3907
04:19:50,140 --> 04:19:50,940
Straight.

3908
04:19:51,820 --> 04:19:54,420
And then we T here.

3909
04:19:55,580 --> 04:19:56,440
Like that.

3910
04:19:56,980 --> 04:19:57,660
Oh, wait.

3911
04:19:58,740 --> 04:19:59,820
No, wait.

3912
04:20:15,110 --> 04:20:18,890
Because only...to get to the middle is only this path.

3913
04:20:21,210 --> 04:20:22,010
So...

3914
04:20:31,540 --> 04:20:33,040
I don't know!

3915
04:20:36,820 --> 04:20:38,580
If it's like...

3916
04:20:44,260 --> 04:20:46,740
But even still this wouldn't work.

3917
04:20:48,380 --> 04:20:50,540
Because then it just go...

3918
04:20:52,960 --> 04:20:54,960
Need to make sure the rotation is right.

3919
04:20:56,180 --> 04:20:57,920
Is there anything else in here that I missed?

3920
04:20:58,920 --> 04:20:59,840
I'm checking.

3921
04:21:02,560 --> 04:21:04,460
I'm checking, I'm checking, I'm checking.

3922
04:21:05,280 --> 04:21:06,120
I don't see anything.

3923
04:21:06,860 --> 04:21:08,660
I don't see anything that I missed.

3924
04:21:11,820 --> 04:21:12,340
No.

3925
04:21:12,340 --> 04:21:12,460
No.

3926
04:21:25,680 --> 04:21:28,100
Sending water left and right but not the center?

3927
04:21:32,150 --> 04:21:34,490
Oh yeah, I guess if we send it here...

3928
04:21:40,030 --> 04:21:41,970
But from here...

3929
04:21:43,210 --> 04:21:44,890
We would need another T.

3930
04:21:45,830 --> 04:21:46,590
You know what I mean?

3931
04:21:46,970 --> 04:21:49,210
Because like...

3932
04:21:51,430 --> 04:21:53,250
If I did this...

3933
04:21:54,450 --> 04:21:57,430
And had it going both ways...

3934
04:21:58,650 --> 04:22:00,470
And then this would be here.

3935
04:22:11,210 --> 04:22:12,330
Like that.

3936
04:22:19,120 --> 04:22:22,600
So I have the tube but not the middle, but...

3937
04:22:22,600 --> 04:22:24,980
If I have it...

3938
04:22:27,500 --> 04:22:31,240
The key is that there is like so many pipes on this side.

3939
04:22:34,180 --> 04:22:37,560
To where the water can be redirected to.

3940
04:22:39,440 --> 04:22:40,000
Wait!

3941
04:22:47,460 --> 04:22:48,780
I had it!

3942
04:22:49,500 --> 04:22:51,740
I didn't realize it would come in through here.

3943
04:22:54,060 --> 04:22:54,640
Yippee!

3944
04:22:59,130 --> 04:23:01,350
We brained, we brained, we brained.

3945
04:23:02,930 --> 04:23:03,950
Alright, go on.

3946
04:23:13,530 --> 04:23:15,610
Why don't we ever see the monkeys?

3947
04:23:15,910 --> 04:23:16,450
Oh that's a bird.

3948
04:23:17,270 --> 04:23:17,790
Nevermind.

3949
04:23:18,990 --> 04:23:20,170
Can I take a picture of the bird?

3950
04:23:24,720 --> 04:23:24,920
No!

3951
04:23:27,000 --> 04:23:28,400
Bird got food.

3952
04:23:30,420 --> 04:23:32,540
I'm gonna eat it's...

3953
04:23:32,540 --> 04:23:33,240
Shit fruit.

3954
04:23:35,900 --> 04:23:38,360
You know how like birds will eat the fruit...

3955
04:23:38,840 --> 04:23:39,780
And they poop it out.

3956
04:23:40,320 --> 04:23:42,980
And then it grows more trees.

3957
04:23:46,760 --> 04:23:48,080
That's gonna be me.

3958
04:23:49,400 --> 04:23:50,620
Oh, please go the same way.

3959
04:23:50,740 --> 04:23:50,840
Okay.

3960
04:23:55,060 --> 04:23:55,560
Gina?

3961
04:23:56,320 --> 04:23:57,320
Gina, you good?

3962
04:24:03,460 --> 04:24:04,120
Gamer paint?

3963
04:24:07,140 --> 04:24:08,480
Oh there is gamer paint.

3964
04:24:09,660 --> 04:24:12,800
Wow, they really need to make it like toxic yellow.

3965
04:24:16,560 --> 04:24:18,340
Those eggs belong in a museum.

3966
04:24:22,940 --> 04:24:23,460
Okay.

3967
04:24:25,700 --> 04:24:26,220
Freedom!

3968
04:24:30,660 --> 04:24:32,780
Gina, I need some help.

3969
04:24:35,560 --> 04:24:36,460
Gina?

3970
04:24:38,420 --> 04:24:39,320
Gina?

3971
04:24:41,360 --> 04:24:43,080
Where are you?

3972
04:24:44,440 --> 04:24:46,380
Gina, I need some help.

3973
04:24:48,240 --> 04:24:50,240
Goddammit, I knew that was gonna happen.

3974
04:24:51,280 --> 04:24:51,800
Gina!

3975
04:24:51,800 --> 04:24:51,940
Ah!

3976
04:25:07,800 --> 04:25:09,240
You pull yourself.

3977
04:25:09,620 --> 04:25:10,800
What do you mean push you up?

3978
04:25:11,460 --> 04:25:13,000
I'm not gonna do the work for you.

3979
04:25:18,500 --> 04:25:19,920
Yeah, right.

3980
04:25:20,740 --> 04:25:21,400
Alright, come on.

3981
04:25:22,140 --> 04:25:23,320
Come on girly.

3982
04:25:23,840 --> 04:25:26,440
I don't know.

3983
04:25:27,180 --> 04:25:28,520
Push!

3984
04:25:35,130 --> 04:25:36,090
Hello.

3985
04:25:38,870 --> 04:25:39,910
You found me!

3986
04:25:56,650 --> 04:25:58,090
Oh, this one down here?

3987
04:26:03,800 --> 04:26:06,280
Yeah, skip on over there.

3988
04:26:06,380 --> 04:26:06,680
I'll run.

3989
04:26:07,820 --> 04:26:08,860
Doctor Joan.

3990
04:26:09,880 --> 04:26:10,800
Indiana Joan.

3991
04:26:16,460 --> 04:26:18,340
How do you know where this is?

3992
04:26:19,320 --> 04:26:20,720
He is a jolly boy.

3993
04:26:26,100 --> 04:26:27,240
Watch out for traps.

3994
04:26:28,240 --> 04:26:29,960
Shiva Shrine!

3995
04:26:39,440 --> 04:26:43,820
Talk to Aran.

3996
04:26:45,800 --> 04:26:49,100
Sound real like a Minecraft villager there.

3997
04:26:57,720 --> 04:26:59,320
Anything behind?

3998
04:26:59,620 --> 04:26:59,880
Nope.

3999
04:27:01,000 --> 04:27:02,440
We got the Amogus.

4000
04:27:03,600 --> 04:27:04,740
All that for an Amogus.

4001
04:27:05,180 --> 04:27:05,720
I swear.

4002
04:27:07,380 --> 04:27:07,960
Your uncle.

4003
04:27:16,280 --> 04:27:21,040
I mean he almost died.

4004
04:27:22,420 --> 04:27:24,060
You almost died Aran.

4005
04:27:27,340 --> 04:27:29,340
Like, who would have gotten you out?

4006
04:27:37,300 --> 04:27:37,740
Really?

4007
04:27:37,740 --> 04:27:39,940
All of that and you're not even gonna come with us?

4008
04:27:40,780 --> 04:27:41,940
This little punk ass.

4009
04:27:41,980 --> 04:27:43,020
I should have left you in there.

4010
04:27:46,240 --> 04:27:48,280
Yeah, he was done for.

4011
04:27:48,360 --> 04:27:49,260
He was donezo.

4012
04:27:49,260 --> 04:27:52,580
He got kidnapped and everything.

4013
04:27:52,820 --> 04:27:53,260
Exactly.

4014
04:27:54,500 --> 04:27:55,080
But no.

4015
04:27:56,300 --> 04:27:58,120
He's gotta stay here and research.

4016
04:27:58,960 --> 04:28:01,620
And do...

4017
04:28:03,740 --> 04:28:06,700
Do scientific things.

4018
04:28:06,960 --> 04:28:08,720
Historical things.

4019
04:28:10,040 --> 04:28:10,920
Patooey.

4020
04:28:11,760 --> 04:28:15,820
Ok, let's go see if we can find a melee weapon.

4021
04:28:15,820 --> 04:28:19,960
To then open up the box that's down here.

4022
04:28:21,140 --> 04:28:22,820
He belongs in a museum.

4023
04:28:24,760 --> 04:28:28,620
Yeah, we will.

4024
04:28:28,940 --> 04:28:29,820
Do you think this one will work?

4025
04:28:31,040 --> 04:28:31,860
Let's try it.

4026
04:28:42,020 --> 04:28:42,580
Alright.

4027
04:28:45,540 --> 04:28:46,520
Grabbed a whip.

4028
04:28:49,400 --> 04:28:50,520
Yeah, exactly.

4029
04:28:50,520 --> 04:28:52,640
Alright, we have a little box here.

4030
04:29:02,070 --> 04:29:02,950
Let's go.

4031
04:29:03,110 --> 04:29:03,330
Alright.

4032
04:29:04,470 --> 04:29:05,370
Move Gina!

4033
04:29:06,050 --> 04:29:07,310
Gina, you're in my way.

4034
04:29:07,910 --> 04:29:08,890
Out of the way woman.

4035
04:29:11,270 --> 04:29:12,910
That was some hot cash.

4036
04:29:17,550 --> 04:29:19,670
Is anyone still alive out here?

4037
04:29:22,490 --> 04:29:23,790
I don't know actually.

4038
04:29:25,170 --> 04:29:26,830
I'm going to heal.

4039
04:29:27,550 --> 04:29:28,810
I'm gonna take their bandages.

4040
04:29:31,250 --> 04:29:32,530
Heal, heal.

4041
04:29:38,250 --> 04:29:39,530
Steal, steal.

4042
04:29:41,510 --> 04:29:42,870
I think everybody's still dead.

4043
04:29:46,290 --> 04:29:48,270
This one's kinda funky.

4044
04:29:48,890 --> 04:29:49,510
What were they playing?

4045
04:29:50,130 --> 04:29:50,650
Polo?

4046
04:29:56,280 --> 04:29:57,440
Just in case.

4047
04:29:59,680 --> 04:30:02,020
Just in case.

4048
04:30:04,460 --> 04:30:05,900
The lobotomizer.

4049
04:30:09,510 --> 04:30:11,050
Yeah, everyone looks pretty dead.

4050
04:30:17,560 --> 04:30:18,280
Okay.

4051
04:30:19,740 --> 04:30:20,680
To Sanan.

4052
04:30:24,420 --> 04:30:26,080
They're gonna take the mallet.

4053
04:30:26,200 --> 04:30:26,380
Okay.

4054
04:30:26,980 --> 04:30:28,560
Everybody take your weapon of choice.

4055
04:30:30,240 --> 04:30:34,100
Grab the weapon that speaks to you.

4056
04:30:35,080 --> 04:30:36,100
From the soul.

4057
04:30:38,720 --> 04:30:44,700
Let's go see what that... There was that one area that said that we could climb up with my whip.

4058
04:30:45,220 --> 04:30:47,560
I do think it was just like a vantage point.

4059
04:30:49,080 --> 04:30:50,500
But we can still see.

4060
04:30:51,980 --> 04:30:54,020
It was like right there I believe.

4061
04:30:54,880 --> 04:30:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4062
04:30:57,360 --> 04:30:59,560
There was one on the other side too.

4063
04:31:01,740 --> 04:31:03,480
You got a chainsaw.

4064
04:31:05,500 --> 04:31:08,900
Ah, I can just take their food and stuff.

4065
04:31:08,980 --> 04:31:10,380
Oh, I could have distracted them.

4066
04:31:12,860 --> 04:31:15,000
This is like super cozy.

4067
04:31:17,700 --> 04:31:19,480
This is like such a nice little...

4068
04:31:22,840 --> 04:31:24,640
Nice little hangout spot.

4069
04:31:24,780 --> 04:31:26,160
Hey, Gina, you should come up here.

4070
04:31:26,220 --> 04:31:26,780
It's great.

4071
04:31:28,560 --> 04:31:30,000
Oh, but you can't.

4072
04:31:30,280 --> 04:31:32,540
Your tiny arms can't bring you up here.

4073
04:31:34,160 --> 04:31:35,180
Sucks for Gina.

4074
04:31:41,270 --> 04:31:42,310
Anything over here?

4075
04:31:42,950 --> 04:31:44,750
No, just more hiding spots.

4076
04:31:45,190 --> 04:31:45,810
Anything in here?

4077
04:31:48,450 --> 04:31:49,790
Nope, I'm stuck.

4078
04:31:50,270 --> 04:31:50,910
Gina, I'm stuck.

4079
04:31:54,090 --> 04:31:55,670
No girls allowed, yeah.

4080
04:31:56,690 --> 04:31:58,150
No girls allowed in our fort.

4081
04:32:00,290 --> 04:32:01,690
Wait, what about me then?

4082
04:32:04,510 --> 04:32:06,210
What are you talking about?

4083
04:32:07,970 --> 04:32:09,690
Come on Gina, let's go home.

4084
04:32:13,230 --> 04:32:14,570
Only Minky allowed.

4085
04:32:14,890 --> 04:32:15,030
Ok.

4086
04:32:15,570 --> 04:32:18,270
Only Minky is allowed in our establishment.

4087
04:32:21,710 --> 04:32:24,250
And there was a fast travel.

4088
04:32:27,210 --> 04:32:29,370
I wonder if we can use it.

4089
04:32:29,370 --> 04:32:31,790
I don't remember where it was at though.

4090
04:32:32,730 --> 04:32:34,310
It was like right over here, no?

4091
04:32:34,710 --> 04:32:35,170
I think.

4092
04:32:39,540 --> 04:32:40,660
Minky is cool so it's ok?

4093
04:32:44,960 --> 04:32:46,360
Oh, sorry, wrong button.

4094
04:32:49,880 --> 04:32:50,760
Let's just go this way.

4095
04:32:55,200 --> 04:32:57,640
Minky is only... Minky is only...

4096
04:33:02,300 --> 04:33:06,360
I think it's a pretty straight path from here even if I don't hit up a...

4097
04:33:08,100 --> 04:33:12,260
Oh wait, but there was a fast travel at the tree house.

4098
04:33:13,200 --> 04:33:13,520
I think.

4099
04:33:13,820 --> 04:33:14,940
Oh gosh, I can't remember.

4100
04:33:17,240 --> 04:33:18,280
Wait, fast travel.

4101
04:33:18,760 --> 04:33:19,140
Perfect.

4102
04:33:21,560 --> 04:33:22,980
I'm docking, I'm docking.

4103
04:33:24,100 --> 04:33:25,360
The secret of the tigers.

4104
04:33:28,980 --> 04:33:30,780
Oh, there are the black circles on the map.

4105
04:33:32,420 --> 04:33:35,140
Ah, I see it.

4106
04:33:35,800 --> 04:33:38,280
So we are going to the village.

4107
04:33:41,300 --> 04:33:41,980
Yippee!

4108
04:33:46,580 --> 04:33:47,420
This way?

4109
04:33:47,600 --> 04:33:47,720
Yep.

4110
04:33:50,540 --> 04:33:51,560
Bye Jones.

4111
04:33:51,720 --> 04:33:52,640
Who said that to me?

4112
04:33:54,500 --> 04:33:55,500
Was that Gina?

4113
04:33:57,080 --> 04:33:57,760
Hi.

4114
04:34:00,780 --> 04:34:01,580
Donation box.

4115
04:34:01,640 --> 04:34:02,840
I still...

4116
04:34:02,840 --> 04:34:04,080
Oh, there is a medicinal hut.

4117
04:34:04,520 --> 04:34:07,900
I still haven't figured out how to unlock those.

4118
04:34:19,280 --> 04:34:20,040
Fifteen!

4119
04:34:20,040 --> 04:34:20,800
Fifteen!

4120
04:34:26,060 --> 04:34:27,580
Fifteen bottles.

4121
04:34:28,660 --> 04:34:29,820
Goodness gracious.

4122
04:34:34,660 --> 04:34:36,580
Why are we taking a picture of?

4123
04:34:40,040 --> 04:34:40,620
Sneak.

4124
04:34:46,120 --> 04:34:47,260
Expensive ass books.

4125
04:34:47,340 --> 04:34:47,780
I know.

4126
04:34:48,060 --> 04:34:48,600
Come on.

4127
04:34:55,620 --> 04:34:58,060
They really did just say Indiana Jones.

4128
04:35:02,160 --> 04:35:03,800
It's hard to say.

4129
04:35:04,980 --> 04:35:05,720
Wait.

4130
04:35:07,260 --> 04:35:08,580
I remember now.

4131
04:35:09,120 --> 04:35:10,840
This is the highest point of the mountain.

4132
04:35:11,900 --> 04:35:15,380
This is the old area of Sukhothai hundreds of years ago.

4133
04:35:15,740 --> 04:35:17,740
This should be the main stream.

4134
04:35:18,300 --> 04:35:19,800
It was steeper back then.

4135
04:35:20,400 --> 04:35:23,580
This should be the current location of the Mahathat temple.

4136
04:35:25,580 --> 04:35:26,320
Mahathat temple.

4137
04:35:27,040 --> 04:35:27,880
Of course.

4138
04:35:33,480 --> 04:35:34,560
Thank you!

4139
04:35:35,680 --> 04:35:37,360
Also, about your...

4140
04:35:37,360 --> 04:35:39,900
Oh, that's not money.

4141
04:35:40,120 --> 04:35:41,120
You got lucky.

4142
04:35:41,700 --> 04:35:42,520
About your nephew.

4143
04:35:51,260 --> 04:35:53,240
Troy Baker is doing his best.

4144
04:35:53,420 --> 04:35:54,280
He's trying real hard.

4145
04:36:05,820 --> 04:36:08,660
I can't understand Indy's Thai.

4146
04:36:08,840 --> 04:36:11,080
I don't think I would be able to either.

4147
04:36:11,580 --> 04:36:13,040
It sounds really stiff.

4148
04:36:14,800 --> 04:36:16,100
Fried egg!

4149
04:36:18,820 --> 04:36:20,280
The kid who vanished.

4150
04:36:21,880 --> 04:36:23,240
We did it!

4151
04:36:28,010 --> 04:36:30,070
Wait, what do you want to tell me about?

4152
04:36:48,090 --> 04:36:51,750
I don't trust any of you saying it's not very far from here.

4153
04:36:56,630 --> 04:36:57,570
Cat!

4154
04:36:58,050 --> 04:36:59,290
Oh cat!

4155
04:36:59,610 --> 04:37:00,990
Fried egg is the cat!

4156
04:37:02,350 --> 04:37:04,630
That's so cute!

4157
04:37:15,610 --> 04:37:16,670
Haunted demon?

4158
04:37:32,370 --> 04:37:33,810
Move out of the way, Indy!

4159
04:37:43,970 --> 04:37:49,630
Wait, but I wanted to meet the demon.

4160
04:37:52,410 --> 04:37:54,230
What do you mean the demon's final breath?

4161
04:38:02,550 --> 04:38:03,370
The cat.

4162
04:38:03,970 --> 04:38:04,610
The cat.

4163
04:38:04,610 --> 04:38:05,710
Fried egg is so cute.

4164
04:38:16,110 --> 04:38:23,200
We should take a look around Wat Sa Sa.

4165
04:38:24,060 --> 04:38:25,880
Maybe there's some truth to the story.

4166
04:38:28,920 --> 04:38:30,040
Lost in the past.

4167
04:38:30,080 --> 04:38:30,620
I think I'm good.

4168
04:38:31,620 --> 04:38:33,860
I think I might actually call it here today.

4169
04:38:35,620 --> 04:38:42,080
Actually, let's get to... Let's go to this and go to a new place, right?

4170
04:38:42,620 --> 04:38:45,080
Find the... No, I'm not finding the cave.

4171
04:38:46,420 --> 04:38:50,700
No, I want to... Speak to Pailin.

4172
04:38:50,800 --> 04:38:51,840
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

4173
04:38:53,580 --> 04:38:54,720
Let's do that.

4174
04:39:00,240 --> 04:39:01,080
Where is she?

4175
04:39:03,960 --> 04:39:05,000
Oh, she's over there.

4176
04:39:08,500 --> 04:39:09,920
Is the game fun, Minto?

4177
04:39:10,040 --> 04:39:11,240
Yeah, I love this game.

4178
04:39:11,280 --> 04:39:11,940
It's so much fun.

4179
04:39:14,860 --> 04:39:17,740
This game is crowded.

4180
04:39:18,060 --> 04:39:19,740
It's packed with stuff.

4181
04:39:22,380 --> 04:39:24,280
There's just so much to do in this game.

4182
04:39:24,660 --> 04:39:25,720
It's insane.

4183
04:39:28,700 --> 04:39:29,500
Hello.

4184
04:39:32,000 --> 04:39:32,820
Yeah, what's up?

4185
04:39:50,020 --> 04:39:51,740
That doesn't sound good.

4186
04:39:53,040 --> 04:39:55,120
It's basically an RPG.

4187
04:39:58,160 --> 04:39:59,600
As far as I know.

4188
04:40:01,780 --> 04:40:03,740
The places are pretty well researched too.

4189
04:40:04,740 --> 04:40:06,760
They put a lot of care into this game.

4190
04:40:06,760 --> 04:40:10,400
That explosion was even bigger than the first one.

4191
04:40:10,780 --> 04:40:11,600
What do you think they're doing?

4192
04:40:12,200 --> 04:40:14,320
Something caught their eye and they're blasting their way to it.

4193
04:40:15,260 --> 04:40:16,520
Digging is slow work.

4194
04:40:17,060 --> 04:40:17,400
Delicate.

4195
04:40:18,580 --> 04:40:19,500
Vos must be desperate.

4196
04:40:20,020 --> 04:40:23,280
Desperate enough to destroy our country in order to get what he wants.

4197
04:40:25,020 --> 04:40:26,680
I'll find out what they're up to.

4198
04:40:31,680 --> 04:40:32,740
Makes you hungry.

4199
04:40:32,740 --> 04:40:32,800
Hungry?

4200
04:40:45,420 --> 04:40:47,740
This is like the next part of...

4201
04:40:50,400 --> 04:40:52,440
Like this is... Wait, stop, stop, stop.

4202
04:40:52,520 --> 04:40:55,980
I'm trying to... I guess we're on the blessed pearl.

4203
04:40:57,240 --> 04:40:58,320
But why isn't it... Hold on.

4204
04:40:58,520 --> 04:40:59,580
Why is it being weird?

4205
04:41:01,420 --> 04:41:02,640
Okay, there we go.

4206
04:41:02,760 --> 04:41:05,320
I was trying to go up and down, but it wouldn't let me.

4207
04:41:06,900 --> 04:41:11,820
Oh no, the Wat Mahatat is where we need to go.

4208
04:41:15,320 --> 04:41:17,020
Technically, for the main story.

4209
04:41:18,520 --> 04:41:22,100
This is the one... Gosh, that's so far!

4210
04:41:24,140 --> 04:41:26,160
And then, the demon in the cave.

4211
04:41:26,280 --> 04:41:28,720
I don't truly... I think we're good on that one.

4212
04:41:29,980 --> 04:41:30,380
Um...

4213
04:41:35,850 --> 04:41:38,490
I feel like this one is good too, though.

4214
04:41:43,600 --> 04:41:45,520
Yeah, I think we'll save it for next time, though.

4215
04:41:46,460 --> 04:41:49,900
The study of fear and the blessed pearl.

4216
04:41:51,280 --> 04:41:53,200
I was hoping maybe we would get out of this area.

4217
04:41:54,500 --> 04:41:56,140
But it doesn't seem to be the case.

4218
04:42:03,900 --> 04:42:04,340
Um...

4219
04:42:05,580 --> 04:42:07,320
Study and fear is a good one.

4220
04:42:08,740 --> 04:42:09,900
Okay, I'll do it.

4221
04:42:12,000 --> 04:42:13,880
Her embroidered eyepatch looks so nice.

4222
04:42:14,000 --> 04:42:14,640
I know, right?

4223
04:42:19,400 --> 04:42:21,080
We got jackpot, though.

4224
04:42:23,680 --> 04:42:27,600
We did... We did... do pretty well, I'd say.

4225
04:42:28,540 --> 04:42:30,600
The giant snake part was perfect for Year of the Snake.

4226
04:42:30,720 --> 04:42:31,580
Loving the game so far.

4227
04:42:31,580 --> 04:42:32,080
Right!

4228
04:42:32,560 --> 04:42:33,160
It was!

4229
04:42:37,740 --> 04:42:40,580
I could keep going, but I feel like I shouldn't.

4230
04:42:42,020 --> 04:42:44,740
I feel like I think I'll stop here.

4231
04:42:45,380 --> 04:42:45,800
And what?

4232
04:42:45,880 --> 04:42:48,260
I don't know how many more streams left of this game.

4233
04:42:48,960 --> 04:42:49,960
I have no idea.

4234
04:42:52,380 --> 04:42:53,360
Thanks, Dry Princess!

4235
04:42:53,700 --> 04:42:55,220
Maybe two or three?

4236
04:42:56,380 --> 04:42:56,800
Maybe?

4237
04:42:57,040 --> 04:42:58,180
I have no idea.

4238
04:42:58,180 --> 04:42:58,280
Hello!

4239
04:43:01,900 --> 04:43:04,240
Taking pictures of the naked people?

4240
04:43:07,600 --> 04:43:08,280
Cooking.

4241
04:43:12,260 --> 04:43:13,620
Let them cook.

4242
04:43:14,800 --> 04:43:16,780
I like just messing around with the people, though.

4243
04:43:17,060 --> 04:43:20,340
I like just running around and seeing what's going on.

4244
04:43:20,800 --> 04:43:21,040
Hello.

4245
04:43:21,820 --> 04:43:25,980
They all give me such... such looks.

4246
04:43:27,060 --> 04:43:28,900
That's so... What am I reaching for?

4247
04:43:29,420 --> 04:43:30,480
Oh, the star fruit.

4248
04:43:36,740 --> 04:43:37,860
You got this!

4249
04:43:41,860 --> 04:43:44,080
I want some coconut now.

4250
04:43:46,100 --> 04:43:48,260
Will this game be counted to your finished games of 2025?

4251
04:43:48,880 --> 04:43:50,220
I think so.

4252
04:43:51,180 --> 04:43:53,320
I'm finishing it in 2025.

4253
04:43:54,180 --> 04:43:55,920
It's a bit of a loophole, but...

4254
04:43:55,920 --> 04:44:02,800
You know, if I wanted it counted towards 2024, I would have put it under 2024.

4255
04:44:04,760 --> 04:44:06,100
I'd count it.

4256
04:44:07,720 --> 04:44:08,920
It counts.

4257
04:44:11,580 --> 04:44:14,780
Well then, let me find a safe point.

4258
04:44:15,600 --> 04:44:17,900
I want the little hat icon, you know.

4259
04:44:19,720 --> 04:44:20,320
Let's...

4260
04:44:21,300 --> 04:44:27,940
We'll go towards the explosion thing and maybe when we get into the boat, it'll save for us.

4261
04:44:28,460 --> 04:44:28,840
Hopefully.

4262
04:44:30,360 --> 04:44:31,660
That's not my boat.

4263
04:44:32,000 --> 04:44:32,700
That's my boat.

4264
04:44:35,880 --> 04:44:37,100
Fast travel.

4265
04:44:40,080 --> 04:44:42,440
You know, whatever.

4266
04:44:44,000 --> 04:44:46,320
Let's fast travel to...

4267
04:44:47,580 --> 04:44:48,020
Uh...

4268
04:44:51,240 --> 04:44:51,680
Where?

4269
04:44:53,700 --> 04:44:54,540
Oh, no, no.

4270
04:44:54,600 --> 04:44:55,080
Steady in here.

4271
04:44:56,640 --> 04:44:58,300
Fast travel to the tree house.

4272
04:44:58,560 --> 04:44:59,440
I think we'll be good.

4273
04:45:00,040 --> 04:45:01,440
It's pretty safe there, actually, too.

4274
04:45:03,760 --> 04:45:05,000
Fast tree house.

4275
04:45:05,120 --> 04:45:05,860
Tree house.

4276
04:45:07,100 --> 04:45:07,540
What?

4277
04:45:09,820 --> 04:45:10,620
Wait, no!

4278
04:45:11,000 --> 04:45:12,700
Wait, I went to the secret armory.

4279
04:45:14,800 --> 04:45:17,200
Mint, when are your streams?

4280
04:45:17,340 --> 04:45:19,260
I post my schedule on Twitter.

4281
04:45:19,700 --> 04:45:28,760
I post my schedule in the community tab and there's a little waiting room on my channel that has my schedules, too.

4282
04:45:31,720 --> 04:45:32,440
Wait.

4283
04:45:35,620 --> 04:45:37,660
Why won't the map work?

4284
04:45:38,200 --> 04:45:39,740
I'm trying to check the map.

4285
04:45:45,180 --> 04:45:46,260
The tree house.

4286
04:45:46,400 --> 04:45:46,820
Oh, wait.

4287
04:45:46,880 --> 04:45:48,380
Maybe it's the black circles.

4288
04:45:48,500 --> 04:45:49,280
Oh, never mind.

4289
04:45:49,420 --> 04:45:50,660
I misunderstood.

4290
04:45:51,040 --> 04:45:51,620
That's my fault.

4291
04:45:52,040 --> 04:45:55,240
We can go to the...

4292
04:45:57,120 --> 04:45:57,680
Whatever.

4293
04:46:00,360 --> 04:46:01,360
I don't know.

4294
04:46:02,480 --> 04:46:03,520
I have no idea.

4295
04:46:04,600 --> 04:46:05,840
Sorry I called you mint.

4296
04:46:06,240 --> 04:46:06,700
No!

4297
04:46:07,740 --> 04:46:08,860
I'm not upset.

4298
04:46:09,240 --> 04:46:10,380
I'm just joking.

4299
04:46:11,880 --> 04:46:12,760
Don't haunt me.

4300
04:46:12,820 --> 04:46:14,000
Actually, please haunt me more.

4301
04:46:18,340 --> 04:46:21,320
Okay, I don't know which one that...

4302
04:46:23,780 --> 04:46:28,160
I don't know which one... The very one at the bottom.

4303
04:46:30,360 --> 04:46:34,600
I wish I could... I wish the fast travels also had names.

4304
04:46:35,680 --> 04:46:37,200
I don't know which one it was.

4305
04:46:38,780 --> 04:46:41,080
Maybe it's the...

4306
04:46:48,140 --> 04:46:50,820
I don't think the hut is closer at all.

4307
04:46:53,680 --> 04:46:55,660
It's that dock you went past and didn't stop at.

4308
04:46:56,000 --> 04:46:57,100
Maybe it's the armory.

4309
04:46:57,660 --> 04:46:58,400
Let's try it out.

4310
04:47:03,060 --> 04:47:04,680
Yeah, I think this is it.

4311
04:47:05,640 --> 04:47:07,140
Oh, no.

4312
04:47:07,780 --> 04:47:09,080
Actually, this works.

4313
04:47:09,580 --> 04:47:11,520
Because it's right over there that we need to get to.

4314
04:47:12,100 --> 04:47:13,700
This one would have been a little bit closer.

4315
04:47:14,660 --> 04:47:16,100
But we don't know what that is.

4316
04:47:18,180 --> 04:47:18,780
So...

4317
04:47:20,440 --> 04:47:21,980
This works, baby.

4318
04:47:22,780 --> 04:47:26,420
Alright, we're not going into the armory, though...

4319
04:47:26,420 --> 04:47:29,500
We could...

4320
04:47:29,500 --> 04:47:33,040
I feel like there's probably a uniform in here.

4321
04:47:33,040 --> 04:47:35,360
You know what I mean?

4322
04:47:37,860 --> 04:47:38,780
We'll see.

4323
04:47:40,880 --> 04:47:42,480
Did it save?

4324
04:47:43,000 --> 04:47:44,200
I can't tell.

4325
04:47:44,980 --> 04:47:46,260
Did it save, you guys?

4326
04:47:46,540 --> 04:47:47,240
I don't know.

4327
04:47:48,960 --> 04:47:49,940
Bye-bye.

4328
04:47:50,560 --> 04:47:51,540
It did?

4329
04:47:51,760 --> 04:47:52,000
Okay.

4330
04:47:54,600 --> 04:47:58,160
Anyway, this was fun.

4331
04:47:59,120 --> 04:48:00,460
Less than a minute ago.

4332
04:48:00,480 --> 04:48:00,980
Okay, perfect.

4333
04:48:01,500 --> 04:48:03,000
I hope you guys are enjoying the game, too.

4334
04:48:04,600 --> 04:48:05,040
Maybe...

4335
04:48:05,040 --> 04:48:05,740
Next stream?

4336
04:48:05,920 --> 04:48:06,540
Stream after?

4337
04:48:08,680 --> 04:48:09,540
We will finish.

4338
04:48:09,900 --> 04:48:10,700
I'll do my best.

4339
04:48:11,340 --> 04:48:12,680
I still have quite a bit to go.

4340
04:48:13,180 --> 04:48:17,220
People were saying that last stream I was at the halfway point or something.

4341
04:48:18,960 --> 04:48:20,400
There's still so much.

4342
04:48:20,900 --> 04:48:21,880
There's still so much.

4343
04:48:22,600 --> 04:48:23,640
Two streams, I think.

4344
04:48:29,620 --> 04:48:30,580
Okey-dokey.

4345
04:48:32,140 --> 04:48:33,100
Otsuminto, everybody.

4346
04:48:33,360 --> 04:48:34,240
I'll see you guys...

4347
04:48:34,240 --> 04:48:35,540
Thank you for the superchat.

4348
04:48:36,220 --> 04:48:38,620
I'll see you guys later tomorrow.

4349
04:48:38,860 --> 04:48:40,360
I play Devil May Cry 3.

4350
04:48:40,620 --> 04:48:41,300
I play more of that.

4351
04:48:42,180 --> 04:48:45,100
I have quite a few games that I'm trying to finish up.

4352
04:48:46,140 --> 04:48:47,380
Finish up, finish up.

4353
04:48:47,720 --> 04:48:49,260
And then we can move on to other stuff.

4354
04:48:52,320 --> 04:48:53,280
Thank you.

4355
04:48:54,320 --> 04:48:56,880
This game has been a lot of fun to watch.

4356
04:48:56,880 --> 04:48:58,160
Otsuminto, thank you.

4357
04:48:59,740 --> 04:49:00,700
Thank you.

4358
04:49:01,620 --> 04:49:02,820
Thanks for the streaming, though.

4359
04:49:02,880 --> 04:49:03,380
Thank you.

4360
04:49:03,500 --> 04:49:04,280
Thanks for watching.

4361
04:49:05,460 --> 04:49:07,260
I'll see you guys later.

4362
04:49:08,180 --> 04:49:09,040
Bye bye.

4363
04:49:09,180 --> 04:49:09,980
Good night, good night.

4364
04:49:10,120 --> 04:49:11,340
Otsuminto, bye bye.
