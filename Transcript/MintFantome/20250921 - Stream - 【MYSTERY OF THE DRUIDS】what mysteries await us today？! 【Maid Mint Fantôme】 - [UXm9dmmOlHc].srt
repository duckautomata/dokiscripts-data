That's what I'm going to do.

7
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
I can't wait to know what secrets they hold.

8
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,660
It was a huge pain in the butt getting this game set up per usual.

9
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,460
My retro gaming era continues.

10
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:46,100

11
00:04:51,480 --> 00:06:20,600
but somehow somehow oh i don't i don't want to get into it i'll get frustrated all over again but we're here yes um i don't know anything about this game mystery of the druids i know nothing so i'm excited to play it um for those curious i did get the gog version so we shouldn't have issues and yeah um I don't know what else to say oh I have to start like a new game because it immediately starts with a with like a cutscene and I was like well I want us to watch that I haven't tested the audio or or anything I haven't done anything we don't know who they are what they were doing but their Stonehenge was in danger of being trodden i saw that's in the opening i had to watch it to test it sorry so you're not going to get my first reaction with the opening cutscene but yeah there's a there's a there's several babies there's several babies actually right off the bat the box art has already sent me into the afterlife i wanted to i saw someone commenting about the thumbnail where it was like

12
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:53,960
the juxtaposition of the anime girl and then the scary man screaming was kind of something and I was like I did that on purpose at first I was like maybe I'll go with like a serious serious thumbnail picture but then I was like wait what if it's like so funny that it's this ugly old dude and and cute anime I was like I want really cute art that like doesn't fit the theme at all My favorite baby's the one on the lower right.

13
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,760
But you're going to give me a binky?

14
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,500
I'll shut up.

15
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,520
I won't speak the whole rest of the time.

16
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,440
Thank you for satisfying a 25-year-old mild curiosity.

17
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,640
I really, I know that there's like videos about this game.

18
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,060

19
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,400
The YouTube essays.

20
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,940

Also, shut the hell up about the hashtag ad in the loading screen.

That shit's going to be up until literally October 1st, day of.

25
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,100
You can shut your mouths.

26
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,020
If you knew how much money I was spending on this, you would also shove it in your face.

27
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,700
So, shut up.

28
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,920
Shut up.

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,160
Shut up.

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760

53
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,140
Okay.

54
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,260
Let's start a new game...

55
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,820
New game!

56
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,120
More ads!

57
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,480
Oh my gosh, 51 cards!

Thank you!

61
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,860
You should add the date and time to the thumbnail.

62
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,580
Nah, I think it'll ruin it.

63
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,220
It'll look ugly.

64
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,920
I decided how I wanted it to look, so that's how I chose it.

65
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,560
Okay, new game!

66
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,980
Oh, wait.

67
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,100
Wait.

68
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,900
I know what.

69
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,640
There we go.

70
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:19,880
Okay.

71
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,200
You'll be able to hear it now.

72
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,300
You should.

73
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
I don't hear sound.

74
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,820
Where's the sound?

75
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,090
Okay.

76
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,610
Can you hear it?

77
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,200
They say yes.

78
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,410
It's really quiet right now.

79
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,160
It's...

80
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
It's low?

81
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,460
Yeah, it's low in general.

82
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,480
Okay.

83
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:54,980
Cool!

84
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,760
Okay, as long as audio is working.

85
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,660
Thank you.

86
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,950
Mystery of the Druids.

87
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,370
Druidist mission.

88
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,850
This

89
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,940
is some spookies.

90
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,660
Perfect for the season.

91
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,480
Oh!

92
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,140
Wait, those are some giant people.

93
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,720
Wait, am I...

94
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,060
crazy?

95
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Oh, are those shadows?

96
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,040
I can't tell actually.

97
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,240
I think... there are shadows?

98
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,650
I'm just small.

99
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,770
Wait, those are definitely shadows.

100
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,150
Oh.

101
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,150
Ruins.

102
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,930
Ruins.

103
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,230
I guess these are druids.

104
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,110
I guess these are druids.

105
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,230
Are these our guys?

106
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,310
What's this party for?

107
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,890
I think this is a birthing party.

108
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,070
Okay.

109
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,350
Look at all these babies!

110
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,390
Two babies.

111
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,030
And...

112
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,390
Three babies!

113
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,430
Wait, I was so preferred to say two more babies.

114
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,310
Look at him go!

115
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,710
Yeah!

116
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,490
Woo!

117
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,490
Oh!

118
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,030
Oh my god!

119
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,290
Wait, I don't remember...

120
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,190
Okay, I definitely was not paying attention during this conference.

121
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,330
Just...

122
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,950
Ah, everybody's dead!

123
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,410
Oh, wait.

124
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,770
Oh, lucky, lucky three.

125
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,430
The three babies!

126
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,830
No way.

127
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,390
The three people and the three babies.

128
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,890
Unfiltered experience time, Ikuzo.

129
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,050
Wait, I turned on subtitles.

130
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,290
What do you think the press are going to say about it?

131
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,050
Oh, one second!

132
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,830
Now get out of here!

133
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,390
Get the hell out of my sight!

134
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,010
I just closed something for me.

135
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:22,970
Okay, we're fine.

136
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,550
I thought it closed the game.

137
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,190
If I have any more trouble with you, you'll be dishing out parking tickets before long.

138
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,510
That's a promise, Lowry!

139
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,950
Lowry!

140
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,690
Okay, I'll turn on subtitles right after this.

141
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,290
I don't want to accidentally skip the cutscene.

142
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,190
Oh, and here's my good friend Halligan.

143
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,630
Another one of the invaluable detectives of our glorious murder squad.

144
00:14:43,190 --> 00:15:59,010
just stand there gaping come in yes I'm glad you could make it after all you're a busy man aren't you I'm so busy no smoking in here well there's so many guns on there I got used to being surrounded by a bunch of incompetent half-baked blockheads but your smart well-dressed colleague Lowry has just earned himself the golden badge of stupidity oh wait I thought Lowry was was good at his job the literal face bomb we've got a bit of a problem we've had an innocent man locked up in jail oh regrettably he was killed in prison oh before we could correct our mistake why didn't you just take him out now we got this lunatic killer running around all over London London we have to make sure that at least this oversight is put right he's staring directly at me your clear-up rate so far ought to be sufficient evidence just looking at the camera there's no point in asking you to clear up anything more than a common bicycle theft but this does happen to be the murder squad I am the chief of this

145
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:41,940

Where did Lowry go wrong?

147
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,030
Where did Lowry go wrong?

148
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,370
Your dear colleague Lowry dealt with the skeleton murders last year.

149
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,410
Skeleton murders?

150
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,470
Lowry worked on the case for several months.

151
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,370
Wait, is he so quiet?

152
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,310
A butcher from South London.

153
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,970
A married man with kids.

154
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,970
Okay, I'll turn- I'll change that.

155
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,830
He was in jail till three weeks ago.

156
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:07,970
Okay.

157
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,190
Hold on one moment.

158
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:09,950
Wait, okay.

159
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,510
Game setting, let's do this.

160
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,670
Voice volume.

161
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,070
Ooh.

Hulligan.

164
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,910
He probably didn't do it at all.

165
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,210
Oh.

166
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,970
You didn't.

167
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,170
How could he be convicted then?

168
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,030
He didn't do it.

169
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,950
How could he be convicted then?

170
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,450
Detective Lowry imaginatively constructed an impressive chain of evidence.

171
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,390
And the court followed his arguments in detail.

172
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,210
The public wanted somebody to blame, and they found somebody.

173
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,710
That's life.

174
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,890
Minky British accent.

175
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,410
Okay.

176
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,650
The whole time I stream.

177
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,030
How do you know the man that the man Lowry arrested didn't commit the murders?

178
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,190
Then the case seems to be closed.

179
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,030
How do you know?

180
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,130
Well, all right, these things happen.

181
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,010
But how do you know that the man Lowry arrested didn't commit the murders?

182
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:27,930
Very simple.

183
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,450
Dead people don't go around committing more murders.

184
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,670
It's a copycat.

185
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,790
There's been another murder.

186
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,750
There's been another murder.

187
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,150
Exactly, Alegon.

188
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,810
A pile of bones has been found in Epping Forest.

189
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,650
Oh, supposedly a male corpse.

190
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,450
We don't know any more than that.

191
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,850
Can't have been Lowry's, man, eh?

192
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,370
Oh, Lowry, how could you drop the ball so bad?

193
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,130
I just managed to get that into Lowry's head as well.

194
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:52,990
You heard it?

195
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,890
Lowry's off the case.

196
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,290
Uh-oh.

197
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,230
Alligan, you drive out to Epping Forest and take a look at the evidence.

198
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,270
Of course, sir.

199
00:18:59,450 --> 00:18:59,910
Yes, sir.

200
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,010
And Alligan, no sloppiness now.

201
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,050
I want results.

202
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,730
Sensible results.

203
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,250
The press has already been terrorizing me this morning.

204
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,190
The killer must be found.

205
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,630
Do I make myself...

206
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,430
Of course, chief.

207
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,110
Good.

208
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,310
This is the fire with all the necessary information.

209
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,230
and now you better get going quickly.

210
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,250
Yes, sir.

211
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,770
Yes, sir.

212
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,870
What else we got in here?

213
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,150
Can I talk to you?

214
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,900
What else can I...

215
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,650
No, I don't think we need to say anymore.

216
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,750
Um...

217
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,410
Wow.

218
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,270
The union jack.

219
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,190
Let's get out of here.

220
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:35,930
Oh!

221
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:37,710
Oh!

222
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,230
Oh!

223
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,470
What is this?

224
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,150
Oh, are these our suspects?

225
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,350
Because there's like 20 people up here.

226
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,110
There's so many guns.

227
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,370
Wait, I don't...

228
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,610
I have a sneaking suspicion that...

229
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,570
Okay, I can't do anything with these.

230
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,570
I have a sneaking suspicion this is not about the skeleton murders.

231
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,130
Because why would they need guns?

232
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,110
Anything else?

233
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,410
No, no map, okay.

234
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,650
Alright, let's head out.

235
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:33,610
Dev photos probably And I Okay Oh this actually pulls up my That's interesting Okay so we have This What is this?

236
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,170
Never mind Oh we got Oh Copy there

237
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,670
I don't know Rush or anything It sounds like people are dying But I can do it again

238
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,410
It's the wink.

239
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,740
Wow.

240
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,900
Oh.

241
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,680
Ooh, science.

242
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,040
I'm running to the science.

243
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,520
I'm running.

244
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:26,680
Oh.

245
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Far too hot to touch.

246
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,300
Okay, turn it off.

247
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,600
If I pull that hose off, the whole of Scotland Yard will blow up.

248
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,040
Oh.

249
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,900
That's not a bad idea.

250
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,820
He's kind of unhinged.

251
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,280
It'll blow up.

252
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,920
Far too hot to touch.

253
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,900
Far too hot to touch.

254
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:47,780
Hello.

255
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,660
Hello, Chris.

256
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,500
Hi, Halligan.

257
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,920
Um, there's work for you.

258
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,740
Have you heard of the new skeleton murder?

259
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
Have you heard of the new skeleton murder?

260
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:58,700
Kind of.

261
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,020
Not only heard, I've already been out to where the body was found, together with the forensic squad.

262
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,600
And, what did you find out?

263
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,360
Not a lot.

264
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,700
The killer did a neat job.

265
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,300
No traces, no witnesses.

266
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
This madman doesn't seem to be so stupid at all.

267
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,080
Unlike Lowry.

268
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,620
That guy doesn't know shit.

269
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,840
Did you examine the other cases as well?

270
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,300
Did you examine the other cases as well, Chris?

271
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:18,980
Of course.

272
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,300
Of course.

273
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,580
What do you think these people died of?

274
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,120
What do you think these people died of?

275
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,940
It was no natural death, if that's what you mean, Heligan.

276
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,960
Oh, just drive out there and have a look at it.

277
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,280
Just you do that, Brent.

278
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,460
There, that poster right here, this one, it looks so sexy, no?

279
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,300
Like, it looks like some...

280
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,000
looks like big booty cheeks.

281
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,680
Nah, it's good.

282
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,080
Okay, Chris, see ya.

283
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,760
Okay, Chris.

284
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,940
See you later on.

285
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,960
It's a little sus.

286
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,380
No, it's, yeah, it's just something sexy about it.

287
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,700
Science is sexy.

288
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,500
Anything else in here?

289
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,220
Oh, here.

290
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,820
Ooh.

291
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,000
Ooh.

292
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,280
Too dangerous to carry the bottle around with me.

293
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,240
I don't even know what kind of stuff that is.

294
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,740
We got ethanol, but we also got but-in-all.

295
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,780
Ethanol?

296
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,560
More like but-in-all.

297
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,540
Snakes?

298
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,500
Could be.

299
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,980
Too dangerous to carry the bottle around with me.

300
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,960
I don't even know what kind of stuff that is.

301
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,280
It doesn't even know what it is.

302
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,620
There's nothing I can do with this.

303
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,560
He's like, yeah, I want to carry it, but it's too dangerous.

304
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,040
Science.

305
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,260
I can't do anything with this.

306
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,280
I can't even pronounce the name on the label.

307
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,700
right.

308
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,660
Oh, I got a thing.

309
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,240
This, I, whatever that was, it looked suspicious.

310
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:44,980
I can't do anything.

311
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,680
I can't do anything.

312
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,780
I can't do anything.

313
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,200
I can't.

314
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,260
I can't.

315
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,160
I just can't.

316
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,760
Bro doesn't know Earth and all.

317
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,240
Okay, we took whatever that was.

318
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,020
It looked kind of mysterious.

319
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,200
Okay, so this door can't go in here.

320
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,560
So we'll go this way.

321
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,080
I love the way he rides.

322
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,360
His face is so funny.

323
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,660
Wait, that's just Straight up Coca-Cola.

324
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,280
Thank you so much for the super chat.

325
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,240
Thank you.

326
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,520
Sorry if I missed some.

327
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,060
I love mint.

328
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,680
But no.

329
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,960
But no.

330
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,800
But no.

331
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,560
Propaninol.

332
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,340
Ethanol.

333
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:27,880
But no.

334
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,220
Hello, Janet.

335
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,200
Hello, Brent.

336
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,780
Uh-oh.

337
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,640
Have you heard?

338
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,560
The chief has handed Lowry's case over to me.

339
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,180
Have you heard?

340
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,000
has handed Lowry's case over to me.

341
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,360
Oh, sounds exactly the same.

342
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,020
Yes, and there was no way that I could have missed the conversation between the Chief and Lowry.

343
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,860
Uh...

344
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,720
Please have the necessary information ready by 2 p.m.

345
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,860
Well, not bad, isn't it?

346
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,680
Please have the necessary information ready by 2 p.m.

347
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,900
and arrange a press conference.

348
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,940
Are you mad?

349
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,260
Look, I'm not your secretary, detective.

350
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,880
Any information in this department is to be treated according to Regulation 12A23.

351
00:25:09,300 --> 00:26:09,600

352
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,560
So I won't get anywhere.

353
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,180
So I won't get anywhere without it, then.

354
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,440
Exactly, Brent.

355
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,460
Rules are rules.

356
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
Rules are rules.

357
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:19,840
Good.

358
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,700
See you later, then.

359
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm going to ask her about her hair.

360
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,880
Hello, Janet.

361
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,780
Hello, Brent.

362
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,200
Your hair, your hair.

363
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,600
Oh, nice day today, isn't it?

364
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,620
Nice day today, isn't it?

365
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,480
Don't trouble yourself, Brent.

366
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,100
I will not go to the cinema with you.

367
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,180
Wait, there's history here.

368
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,760
got your green scarf.

369
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,300
Do you want it back?

370
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,220
How do you know I was going to ask that, Janet?

371
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,960
There's us green.

372
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,180
No, Janet.

373
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,240
That's not what's on my mind at the moment.

374
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,960
I've still got your green scarf.

375
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,020
You want it back?

376
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,100
Oh, that ugly thing that the department gave me as a present for my birthday.

377
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,760
Well, I was hoping you'd either forget it or throw it away.

378
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,740
Just keep it, please.

379
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,100
It's autumn.

380
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,260
You'll catch a cold.

381
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,240
Well, that's still better than making a fool of myself by wearing such a scarf.

382
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,500
And now I don't feel like talking to you anymore.

383
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,940
See you later.

384
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,080
Janet, please.

385
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,340
Give me one more chance.

386
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:22,740
Janet.

387
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Good.

388
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,840
See you later, then.

389
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,240
Take your time, Brent.

390
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,300
Today, isn't it?

391
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,960
Hello, Janet.

392
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,000
Hello, Brent.

393
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,940
Janet's relationship to you.

394
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
Wait, have you got a minute?

395
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,460
Have you got a minute?

396
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,200
Not even a minute, Brent.

397
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,280
Do I look as though I...

398
00:27:39,300 --> 00:28:07,320
I've got any time oh we're just harassing HR HR can't you stop your work for a moment it's important can't you stop working for a moment what do you need oh I need I want to make a couple of inquiries at your terminal I just want to make a couple of inquiries at your terminal sorry Brent but there's no way you're going to do that,

399
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,900
not without proper authorization.

400
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
I've heard the cinema is bad for a date.

401
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,560
You would agree or disagree.

402
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,020
Whoa, I think cinema is great for a date.

403
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,640
Wait, who would say that it's not good for a date?

404
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:31,480
I guess you don't get to really talk to the person, but it's dark and quiet, and you can share popcorn, and then what if you both reach for the popcorn at the same time, and then your hands touch, and you're like, oh, yeah.

405
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,240
Yeah, and then afterwards, you get...

406
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:44,900
get to you can and then afterwards you can discuss the movie even if it sucked you could be like man that movie sucked

407
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:12,150
okay good see you later then bye take your time Brent take your time she hates me she hates me this is like chief hates Lowry future Oh, I just spat all over the place.

408
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,730
Future plan for London North.

409
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,650
I'll take that with me.

410
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,950
Is that?

411
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,510
You never know.

412
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,270
I might need it.

413
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,050
Did I just take a piece of...

414
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,850
Is that a napkin?

415
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,150
It's always handy having one of these tucked away.

416
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:24,570
It is.

417
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,770
You ran out not so long ago, and there was a big commotion on this floor.

418
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,610
What is it?

419
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,050
I'm taking things.

420
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:30,810
I don't know what they...

421
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,190
At least that's one thing you can get hold of here without too much trouble.

422
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,610
They are needed for the forms.

423
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,830
Makes it easier for the chief to sign them.

424
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,350
Oh, like, this is a clipboard.

425
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:38,750
Okay.

426
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:39,910
No?

427
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:40,950
All right.

428
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,350
The way he like jogs is just too funny.

429
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:47,590
What's this?

430
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,750
Oh,

431
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,230
Vernon Doyle!

432
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,550
Hello, Mr. Doyle.

433
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,040
That is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes.

434
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,120
Hello, Mr. Doyle.

435
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,240
Hello, Mr. Doyle.

00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,420

Hello, Lowry.

440
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,860
Lowry the goat.

441
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,220
Oh, no, not you, Halligan.

442
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,940
You're all I need at the moment.

443
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,280
Um, it's a nice suit you're wearing.

444
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,520
It's a nice suit you're wearing.

445
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,080
Don't humor me, Halligan.

446
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,660
You don't know a thing about suits.

447
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,300
A blind man would know from a hundred yards away that you bought your stuff at Woolworths.

448
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,540
What do you want?

449
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,340
Oh, I do look a little bit like Colombo.

450
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,540
Wait, yeah, wait, his ass is dying.

451
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,400
Wait, he has no chair.

452
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,160
why is he floating

453
00:31:52,150 --> 00:32:20,330
Scott Cavs of steel he can just hold himself up oh my god he's a hero he's a superhero amazing core strength let me see my wallet just want to say I'm sorry to hear that things went so badly um I haven't seen my wallet just a quick question Larry he's or a farmer you've seen my wallet your wallet you've got a nerve I haven't really had a very pleasant day so far,

454
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,590
as you might have noticed.

455
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,310
I think everybody hates me, though.

456
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,510
Why would I worry about your bloody wallet?

457
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,230
Oh, they changed.

458
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,330
They censored it.

459
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,930
They censored it.

460
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,090
The subtitle said goddamn.

461
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,490
But he said bloody.

462
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,490
They censored the British slang.

463
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,510
Larry, could you just give me a sensible answer?

464
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,450
I'm looking for my wallet.

465
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,970
Larry, could you just give me a sensible answer?

466
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,110
We're just harassing everybody.

467
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,290
I'm looking for my wallet.

468
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,410
I've got it.

469
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,590
Why don't you just go and clear up your oh so tidy office?

470
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,830
That's good localization.

471
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,970
Maybe you'll find some of those things you allegedly just wanted to borrow for a while.

472
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,130
Thank you for being so friendly, Lowry.

473
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,490
Enjoy your spare time.

474
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,150
Let's not argue, Lowry.

475
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,130
I need some information.

476
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,390
Let's not argue, Lowry.

477
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,390
I need some information from you about the last investigations.

478
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:12,850
Yes.

479
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,430
You've got the file, Halligan.

480
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,810
I suppose you can read.

481
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,450
Actually, I don't know how to open it, actually.

482
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,290
I've read your file.

483
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,150
There's just nonsense.

484
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:21,570
Oh.

485
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,230
I've read your file.

486
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,230
There's just nonsense in it.

487
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,610
You know what I think, Halligan?

488
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:34,210
I think I don't need to tolerate a detective and a 20-pound suit walking past my door criticizing the quality of my work.

489
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,950
Well, you got fired.

490
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,590
If my suit was more expensive, would that make your file any better?

491
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,230
If my suit was more expensive, would that make your file any better?

492
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,090
Very witty, detective.

493
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,810
Yes, really.

494
00:33:51,830 --> 00:34:18,410

I turned your fan on so you can cool off, buddy.

496
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:26,910
Okay.

497
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,330
We can take the elevator.

498
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,650
We could take another.

499
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,250
Societal menace!

500
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,370
Did you change your name?

501
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,130
I recognize your profile.

502
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,790
Thank you so much for the vibe gifted!

503
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,030
Oh, okay, so this has...

504
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,010
Wait, I'm not done here yet.

505
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,430
Ah!

506
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,490
Oh, I'm running back to the Scotland yard.

507
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,530
Okay, here.

508
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,580
This is my office.

509
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,740
No, kidding.

510
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,060
Okay.

511
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,460
Wait, who's this?

512
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
The quaint.

513
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,300
The cleaner will empty the ashtray.

514
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,360
Oh my god, no, you should be...

515
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,940
I won't find anything I could make use of now in there.

516
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,620
You should be cleaning after yourself.

517
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,240
Unfortunately, there's no pizza in there anymore.

518
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,040
No pizza!

519
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,500
Unfortunately, there's no pizza in there anymore.

520
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,060
There's no pizza anymore.

521
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,100
Click on the queen.

522
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,260
Oh!

523
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,860
Is that our boss?

524
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,760
There's no pizza.

525
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,940
Oh, okay.

526
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,280
Even if I leave, it switches it back.

527
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,720
I won't find anything I could make use of now in there.

528
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,360
This is so fine.

529
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
I can find my way without a map.

530
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,980
I know my way around well enough.

531
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,980
Well, then take it down.

532
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,440
If you don't need it anymore, smarty pants.

533
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,800
Chief Inspector Miller will get this file early enough.

534
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,220
How do I read the file that we have been given?

535
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,260
Oh, maybe here.

536
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:29,600
Okay.

537
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,280
Of course.

538
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,700
It can't work like that.

539
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,640
Oh, just kidding.

540
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,660
No, better not.

541
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,200
This man lacks maid instincts and doesn't know how to say pizza.

542
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,960
I guess there's not really anything in here.

543
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,540
Then.

544
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,440
I thought that was a family photo.

545
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,900
I really didn't expect the queen.

546
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,780
Oh my gosh.

547
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,480
Let me try right clicking it.

548
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,420
It just like puts it back in my inventory.

549
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,180
Like that.

550
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,200
Okay, let's go to where the murders are in the forest.

551
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,660
Epping forest.

552
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,160
Stupid Epping forest.

553
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,720
And people say Disco Elysium is the ghost of detective games.

554
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,500
We have this masterpiece.

555
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,680
How do I click on it?

556
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,660
Oh, there we go.

557
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:27,920
Okay.

558
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:28,860
Oh.

559
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,220
Whoa.

560
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,460
Hello, Soft.

Just a little bit more...

565
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,670
Uh, game settings.

566
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,350
That should be good.

567
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,790
The piano is just so loud.

568
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,200
Okay.

569
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,060
Always happy to get your streaming, though.

570
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,060
Thank you, Neptune!

571
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,480
Welcome back.

572
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,280
I think you'd love the FMV point-and-click mystery game contradiction spot the liar.

573
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,440
That sounds fine.

574
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,380
Um, could he have left the bones here?

575
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,540
Could he have left the bones here?

576
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,560
It's not impossible, but I don't really believe it.

577
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,640
He's a tourist and only arrived in London last night.

578
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:15,960
Oh.

579
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,660
I suppose he came here by accident.

580
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,820
He's a tourist.

581
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,380
Since when do tourists jog at half-five in the morning?

582
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,720
Is he on a fitness trip?

583
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,120
Sir, he told us he was a decathlete.

584
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,240
It's his job.

585
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,260
Okay, officer, that was it.

586
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:32,940
Thank you.

587
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,620
Anytime, sir.

588
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,740
Okay, officer, that was it.

589
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,480
Thank you.

590
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,920
Can I talk to them?

591
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,500
No, I want to be in the TV.

592
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,720
Oh, I have to leave first.

593
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,860
Let me be interviewed, please.

594
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm very important to this case.

595
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,100
I'm the head investigator, after all.

596
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,740
As of 20 minutes ago.

597
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:53,780
Whoa!

598
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:54,940
V-Toy!

599
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,200
Thank you so much for the gifton!

600
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,280
90s, campy horror, minto, kinko, kino.

601
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,380
I love it.

602
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,900
Oh, wow.

603
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,680
You think you could construct a human from this?

604
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,200
I could.

605
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:10,920
Wait.

606
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,360
What do you want me to do?

607
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,720
I should take the bone with me, but...

608
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,960
But what?

609
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,400
I don't know what parts go to what.

610
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,140
Take it.

611
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,900
I should take...

612
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,620
You don't transport a piece of evidence in your coat pocket.

613
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,180
That might falsify traces.

614
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,420
Oh, he's actually...

615
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,200
Okay, you're right.

616
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,920
You're right.

617
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,520
My bad.

618
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,520
Uh...

619
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,800
Get me out of here.

620
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,720
Get me...

621
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,160
There we go.

622
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,500
Well, that was fascinating.

623
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,120
I looked at it.

624
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,640
What do you want me to do now?

625
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,680
Is there anything else?

626
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,330
Officer?

627
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,690
Officer?

628
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,690
What is it, sir?

629
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,310
I've got the impression I've lost my wallet somewhere here.

630
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,990
Why?

631
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,170
You just got here.

632
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,490
Why would you think you lost your wallet?

633
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,610
I've lost my wallet and I think it may be here somewhere.

634
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,510
Have you seen it?

635
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,150
Are we the killer?

636
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,090
No.

637
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,170
Could you help me look for it?

638
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,030
Could you help me look for it?

639
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,770
Sir, I have to guard the scene of the crime.

640
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,570
I'm under orders not to leave this place.

641
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,090
But all my money was in the wallet!

642
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,530
But all my money was in the wallet.

643
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,810
Can't you just help me look for it?

644
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,690
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't have your wallet.

645
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,970
And I must not leave this place.

646
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,690
Would you please appreciate that?

647
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,890
Oh my gosh.

648
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,410
Okay.

649
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,650
Okay, officer, that was it.

650
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,350
Thank you.

651
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,070
Anytime, sir.

652
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,030
We gotta go back to the office.

653
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,570
That's where our wallet is.

654
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:53,830
Maybe.

655
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:54,530
Hopefully.

656
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,450
All right, back to the Scotland Yard.

657
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,630
Running is so funny.

658
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,210
My cat is in here with me, by the way, so I might have to let her out soon.

659
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:13,150
Is it a crime to leave your bones in the park now?

660
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:13,910
Apparently.

661
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,310
Do I have to go get the signature or whatever?

662
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,190
How'd you guys know it was pause?

663
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,050
Wait, what's this?

664
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,150
Oh, yoink.

665
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,850
What was it?

666
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,390
Oh, you said she.

667
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,630
Wow.

668
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,870
Hello, chief.

669
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,070
May I just disturb you briefly?

670
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,650
You're a pain in the neck.

671
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:57,630
Are you planning to start doing things just like Lowry did?

672
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,710
I need a signature for database inquiry.

673
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,610
I've been to see Janet.

674
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,390
Have you seen...

675
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,990
Have these absurd measures been introduced because of me?

676
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,190
Chief, I've been to see Janet.

677
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,210
Have these absurd measures been introduced because of me?

678
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,890
Among others, yes.

679
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,590
They were introduced for your benefit.

680
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,350
What did I do?

681
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,690
Are you still cross with me because of that business with the Royal Fair?

682
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:54,030
of that business with the royal family what did i do indeed yes indeed detective the press and the inspector have made my life hell for eight weeks you should be grateful that we somehow managed to keep things under control but those sort of jokes are a thing of the past you and laurie will have to ask for my signature before you take a single step even if you just want to go to the toilet what did we do i need information from the central database it's about the skeleton murders but janet says she needs a signed 223.

683
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,930
yeah i've posted her on twitter before You've got it with you.

684
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:58,430
How nice for you.

685
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,870
And do you know something, Heligan?

686
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,970
I will not sign it.

687
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:02,410
Why?

688
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:02,950
I say to that.

689
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:07,910
Why not, Chief?

690
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:08,870
Why not, Chief?

691
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,730
You don't need the database.

692
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,090
You've got the file.

693
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,530
Make the most of it.

694
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:18,940
Uh...

695
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,520
How do you expect me to conduct everyone letting me use the database?

696
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:27,120
How do you expect me to conduct investigations if you won't allow me to use the database?

697
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:27,920
Chief.

698
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,300
You'll have to get out of your backside and do your own work, Halligan.

699
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,200
I feel much more comfortable knowing that you and Lowry can't get up to any more nonsense with the confidential data stored in our database.

700
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,180
Okay.

701
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,720
Of course, Chief.

702
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,240
Thanks a lot.

703
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Don't get stroppy, Halligan.

704
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,640
What am I supposed...

705
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,160
I can't even read the file.

706
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,940
Wait, I don't know how to read it.

707
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,240
Hold on, I'm gonna...

708
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:04,220
I'm gonna go take it back to our good pal here.

709
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,060
Hey, buddy.

710
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,320
Do you know how to read this?

711
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,200
Oh, wait.

712
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,520
Oh, I took matches.

713
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,760
That's what it is.

714
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,120
Do you know how to read this?

715
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,140
Wait.

716
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,790
That would be stupid.

717
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:24,710
Okay.

718
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,450
Bye, Lowry.

719
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,390
It's a PDF.

720
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,450
Wait, what?

721
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:34,810
Wait.

722
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,130
Like, actually the game manual?

723
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,830
Oh my gosh.

724
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:46,450
Wait.

725
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:48,690
Outside of the game.

726
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,370
Wait, so the manual that I saw that was a PDF?

727
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:57,510
That I have to...

728
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,090
Okay, hold on.

729
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,070
Documents.

730
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,330
Manual.pdf.

731
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:03,870
Okay.

732
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,970
uh preface

733
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,230

737
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,470
Okay.

738
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:51,710
Wrong.

739
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:52,390
Okay.

740
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:53,530
Um.

741
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,930
Guys, we have 3D characters with up to 1,000 polygons.

742
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,490
More than 20 characters to talk to.

743
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,330
High resolution 2D, 3D graphics.

744
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,370
More than 370 interactive scenes.

745
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:07,990
Wow.

746
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,650
Surround sound.

00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:15,130
1000.

748
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:20,350
Um, controlling the game, magnifying glass.

749
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:22,070
Uh.

750
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,510
Picker time.

00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:26,660
Thank you.

752
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:27,200
Okay.

753
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,980
When you pick up an item in the game, it'll appear briefly in the top right hand corner of the screen.

754
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,500
Then it becomes part of the inventory.

755
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:51,520
All items you have picked up will always become available in the inventory bar to bring up the inventory simply lower the edge touch the lower edge of the game screen with the cursor scroll through the items move the mouse left or right you will see arrow how do I open the thing though

756
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:06,560

757
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,680

Minto.

759
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,800
Wow.

760
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:15,920
Whoa!

761
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,660
This document was written in 2001 after all.

762
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,300
Jade, thank you so much for the vibe gift.

763
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,180
The image, right?

764
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,600
The image was so funny.

765
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,340
Okay.

766
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,940
Uh...

767
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,900
Resume game.

768
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,260
Um...

769
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,820
Okay, let me go.

770
00:48:41,840 --> 00:49:01,700
go back to the manual real quick if you become stuck consider the current situation what are you trying to achieve uh it doesn't say in the manual you guys lied the manual does not say what the what the files are does not say

771
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:41,740
i don't know what's going on what are we trying to achieve but can i copy them no me no uh it took 1 000 polygons to construct one of two bees but just shut up okay baby let's look for my wallet yeah i think i think she might have my wallet or let's check my desk oh oh what's this a pencil no no no no no play

772
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,340
I'd better leave that here.

773
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:47,760
Okay.

774
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,740
Well, who can I call?

775
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,060
It doesn't work like that.

776
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,820
You don't... It doesn't work like that.

777
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,380
You don't hear anything, and nothing happens either.

778
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,740
I never use the receiver.

779
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,280
That thing is just too heavy.

780
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,280
Using the loudspeaker is much more comfortable.

781
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:00,780
Okay.

782
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,140
They're too busy!

783
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,320
Wait, what is it in London?

784
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,020
Instead of 9-1-1.

785
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,060
Make sure that you make regular saves.

786
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,060
This game has around three hard soft locks.

787
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,780
I'm doing things slightly out of order.

788
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,640
Oh, thank you, Nine Ball.

789
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,420
Thank you.

790
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,440
9-9-9.

791
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,170
Oh.

792
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:44,890
Okay.

793
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,210
Um.

794
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,590
Is it Tay time?

795
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,310
Let's see, anything else?

796
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,690
Chief Inspector Miller will get this file early enough.

797
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,530
The cleaner will empty the ashtray.

798
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,530
Oh my god!

799
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,910
Can we sit and like ponder and read?

800
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,370
I won't find anything I could make use of now in there.

801
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,550
I don't know.

802
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,230
I'm already lost, I'm already stuck.

803
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,850
I won't find anything I could make use of now in there.

804
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,810
Walk through friend!

805
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,070
Solve these skeleton murders, Minto.

806
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,650
I'm too afraid to walk outside my cemetery.

807
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:22,910
Uh...

808
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:24,370
Drawers.

809
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,310
Ask Boss for a signature.

810
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,310
We already tried that.

811
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,350
This.

812
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,290
There's only superfluous stuff in there.

813
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,010
I didn't see this.

814
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:37,550
Ah!

815
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:39,150
I'll take it with me.

816
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,990
Maybe I'll give it back to Miss Browning today.

817
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,010
Yes, we will.

818
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,170
But is this dying to quit?

819
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,350
I'm determined to give up smoking.

820
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,250
Leave those alone.

821
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,030
Okay.

822
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,770
We're dying to quit.

823
00:51:50,930 --> 00:52:08,810

Have you forgotten something again?

826
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,820
Yeah, I think she's into me.

827
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,860
She's playing hard to get.

828
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,920
Um, thought I'd drop in.

829
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,080
Or wait, nice day.

830
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,000
Nice day today, isn't it?

831
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,620
Don't trouble yourself, Brent.

832
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,660
He puts his arms behind his face.

833
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,480
I will not go to the cinema with you.

834
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,960
I have your green scarf.

835
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,300
Wait, do you think going to the cinema with me is that bad?

836
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,720
Do you think going to the cinema with me is that bad?

837
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,680
Okay, then.

838
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,440
No cinema.

839
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Why don't we just go down to the king's pub, have a pint, and Talk for a bit.

840
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:30,680
Listen, Brent, I don't feel like going to a stinky, cheap pub, drinking watery beer and talking about darts, pizzas, and aliens.

841
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,080
Oh, she can say pizza, so it's not just a British thing.

842
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,980
Janet, what's up?

843
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,680
Has Lowry been talking nonsense about me again?

844
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,400
Don't worry about that.

845
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,340
No, Halligan, and he doesn't need to either.

846
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,280
You talk enough of it yourself.

847
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,040
And now, please be good enough to let me carry on with my job, okay?

848
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,620
Lowry has been talking about me!

849
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,300
talking about me, and you believe every word he said.

850
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,120
I believe only what I see, Detective Halligan.

851
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,360
And right now, I can see a man right in front of my desk who is wasting my time.

852
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,860
Then Larry tell you that he's been fired off the case?

853
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,260
Good.

854
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,220
See you later, then.

855
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,620
Take your time, Brent.

856
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:14,680
Okay.

857
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,180
Anything here that I've missed?

858
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,040
What's this?

859
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,920
What about these?

860
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,560
No.

861
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,360
Trash can?

862
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:33,780
No.

863
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:34,500
What's this?

864
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:35,840
No.

865
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,300
Ladies' coats don't suit me.

866
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,680
I love how nice and friendly all the characters are in this game.

867
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,000
It's the air, you know.

868
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,680
British air.

869
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,140
What about in here?

870
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,020
We only talked to this guy once.

871
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,900
She was about to say yes.

872
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,460
Just ask her one more time.

873
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:57,980
Hi, Halligan.

874
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,280
I've just come back from the place where they found the bones in Epping Forest.

875
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,000
Mm-hmm.

876
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Why are you telling me?

877
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,980
Have there been any decisive discoveries in that case?

878
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,200
The writer is German.

879
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,920
Halligan says pizza.

880
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:11,560
Oh.

881
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,440
There was just a pile of bones.

882
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,260
There was a pile of bones.

883
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,820
Nothing else.

884
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,540
Yes, I had that impression as well when I was out there with the forensic squad.

885
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,900
Everything is quite clean.

886
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,220
You didn't find anything either.

887
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,180
No, nothing.

888
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,260
I would actually have been surprised if you had.

889
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,860
And why did you come here then, if I may ask?

890
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,440
Oh, I thought you might be interested in this.

891
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,280
Sure, Halligan.

892
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,400
Thank you.

893
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,320
Anything else?

894
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,460
No, that was it.

895
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,040
Well, then, see you later.

896
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,560
Well...

897
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,220
Okay, Chris.

898
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,420
See you later on.

899
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,020
What did I...

900
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,600
Hello, Chris.

901
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,420
Hi, Halligan.

902
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,680
I've just come back from the place where they found the bones in Apping Forest.

903
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,700
Why are you telling me?

904
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,380
Have there been any decisive discoveries in that case?

905
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,380
Sorry, I didn't realize it was the same thing.

906
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:17,740

Oh, I grabbed something.

912
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:34,880
What are these?

913
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,300
Leave them.

914
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,060
I don't need those anymore.

915
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,140
What is that?

916
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,620
Oh, wait.

917
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,880
Are those all cigarettes?

918
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,880
Oh, my God.

919
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,120
Coat uses black hole technology.

920
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,600
All right.

921
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:48,940
We got something.

922
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,400
I don't know what that was.

923
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,660
I've already taken one this morning.

924
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:55,460
Okay.

925
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,320
What?

926
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,520
There's the other sock!

927
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,540
Ah!

928
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,600
We got gloves.

929
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,200
Okay, now we can go grab the bow.

930
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,300
Okay.

931
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,080
It's boning time!

932
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

933
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,800
Why do we have both socks and two different...

934
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,400
Okay.

935
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,740
In two different drawers.

936
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,700
All right.

937
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:23,060
Hello.

938
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,700
Let me use my hands.

939
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,980
That won't feel different with gloves either.

940
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,460
That won't feel different with gloves either.

941
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,180
No?

942
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,620
That would be stupid.

943
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,480
That won't feel different with gloves either.

944
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,600
Just kidding.

945
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:39,680
What is this?

946
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,100
That is no important evidence, I'm sure, about that.

947
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,880
There's no point in that.

948
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,340
Oh.

949
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,080
The scarf.

950
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:52,500
Hmm.

951
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,760
That would be stupid.

952
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,300
Okay.

953
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:54,980
You're right.

954
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,220
I just thought it might work.

955
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,680
You have to select the big one.

956
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:00,100
I did!

957
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,620
This one?

958
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,780
I should take the bone with me, but...

959
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,540
I did select the big one.

960
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,280
Unless...

961
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:37,280
that won't feel different with gloves either it's a mystery maybe what's this do ah I grabbed it I grabbed oh okay so it's an evidence bag ah okay we got the bone oh wow that's a big old impression there I'm gonna take this bone hello officer any news no sir I just want to ask you something else yes sir

962
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,280
You said you know the other cases?

963
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,700
You just said you know the other cases.

964
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,620
That's right, sir.

965
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,880
Well, I read about them in the newspaper.

966
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,880
Um, what do you think the murderer does with the flesh?

967
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,900
What do you think the murderer does with the flesh of his victims?

968
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,900
That's too hard to answer, sir.

969
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:02,380
I haven't got a clue what goes on in lunatics' heads when they do things like that.

970
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,840
Maybe he freezes them.

971
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,260
Oh.

972
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,100
That's happened before.

973
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,280
That's such an interesting answer.

974
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:07,680
answer.

975
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,200
Something that a murderer would come up with.

976
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,880
He was murdered in prison.

977
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,240
Apparently the man sold the flesh of his victims to the butcher shop.

978
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,660
Apparently the man sold the flesh of his victims in his butcher's shop.

979
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,060
Can you believe that?

980
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,320
Wait, that was the wrong guy.

981
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:29,120
That's what they wrote in the Sun, but I'd rather not believe it.

982
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,760
We know that's the wrong guy.

983
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,020
If that was true, they have all become cannibals.

984
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:37,760
Okay.

985
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,660
Okay, officer, that was it.

986
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,360
Thank you.

987
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,140
Anytime, sir.

988
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:41,520
Yep.

989
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,680
See ya.

990
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,380
All right, let's go get this maybe, I guess, to the scientist man.

991
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:52,400
Yeah, yeah, run, run.

992
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,020
Is this what the Scotland Yard actually looks like?

993
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,160
Nice conversation.

994
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,420
It was full of lies.

995
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,740
Literally, Lowry was fired because it wasn't the butcher.

996
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,180
And then he's just like, yeah.

997
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:07,600
murdered.

998
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,060
It was the guy who killed him.

999
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,900
I've just come back from the place where they found the bones in that forest.

1000
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:12,540
And?

1001
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,020
Trail-blazing new findings?

1002
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,180
I've got something here I'd like you to have a look at.

1003
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:17,560
Yes.

1004
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:17,900
Tell me.

1005
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,920
Yes, I have...

1006
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,560
this.

1007
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,920
Here you go, Chris.

1008
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:23,940
Have a look at this.

1009
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:24,740
A bone.

1010
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,020
Very likely the right thigh bone.

1011
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,420
Ooh.

1012
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,000
Why are you bringing it here?

1013
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,720
I had a look at the bones with the forensic squad this morning.

1014
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,940
I know, but I've still got a couple of questions about them.

1015
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,340
Well, go ahead, then.

1016
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:36,940
Okay.

1017
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:43,080
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, abnormalities.

1018
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,580
Can you see any abnormalities?

1019
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,120
I would have noticed them, Halligan.

1020
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,760
No fractures, no bruises.

1021
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:50,740
Everything quite normal.

1022
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,060
Okay.

1023
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,160
Uh, scorch the...

1024
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,900
Did somebody maybe scorch the flesh off the bone?

1025
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,780
No, definitely not.

1026
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,000
That would look different.

1027
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,980
I suspect that it was rather cut off, or maybe taken off with acid.

1028
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,280
What sex was the victim?

1029
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:07,480
him.

1030
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,680
Judging by the structure of the bones, I think it was Mio.

1031
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,820
I'll write that down in my reports as well, but I'll tell you right now that you won't get it before the end of the week, Halligan.

1032
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,340
Come on, come on, Chris.

1033
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,260
Come on, you could be faster than that.

1034
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,440
You can't tell me more than that about the bones.

1035
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,200
Chris, that doesn't help me.

1036
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,600
There's really no more to say about the bones, Halligan.

1037
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,780
Just wait for my report.

1038
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,520
You'll have it all nicely written down then.

1039
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,380
Or, hang on a moment.

1040
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,360
If you're really interested, go and see Professor Turner.

1041
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,620
He was supervisor of a friend's PhD thesis.

1042
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,120
Oh.

1043
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,840
That's how I met him.

1044
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:41,920
He works in the Anthropology Museum.

1045
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,160
Why is everyone an asshole at Epstein?

1046
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:43,640
I don't know.

1047
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,080
If anybody can say anything about the bones, he can.

1048
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:47,340
Okay.

1049
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:47,720
Okay.

1050
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,000
Thanks for the advice.

1051
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,200
Don't mention it, Brent.

1052
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,320
Yahoo!

1053
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,020
All right.

1054
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,680
We got a new lead.

1055
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,520
We're going to go talk to a professor.

1056
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,380
All right.

1057
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,260
All right.

1058
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,600
Halligan, I need you to run.

1059
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,480
I don't need you to look cool and walk in slow motion.

1060
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:08,220
He's not an idiot.

1061
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,780
He's just a guy.

1062
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,200
Museum of Oxford.

1063
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:14,960
Whoa.

1064
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,270
Go to those birds.

1065
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,330
What's this right here?

1066
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,230
I'd like to sit on this bench here all day.

1067
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:33,990
But I don't have the time.

1068
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:36,230
Lazy.

1069
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:38,490
All right.

01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:38,970

Bagger off.

1084
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,640
It's telling you to go.

1085
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:31,900
I need to go.

1086
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,720
Okay, I must be off now.

01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,280
Well then, okay.

1088
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,340
Okay, wait, hold on, I'm gonna give him this clear.

1089
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,740
I should think about it again.

1090
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,900
Just kidding, he doesn't want it.

1091
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:41,840
Hello, my friend.

1092
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,820
We're just, we're so friendly to everybody and everybody else hates us.

1093
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,380
Um, how are you doing?

1094
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,200
How are you doing?

1095
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:49,580
What?

1096
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,340
What do you want?

1097
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,560
Um...

1098
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,880
Oh, isn't it cold for you on the ground?

1099
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,680
Isn't it too cold for you on the ground?

1100
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,260
Ah, so what?

1101
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,220
This stuff here.

1102
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,880
It warms you up better than any heating.

1103
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,320
What is it, if I may ask?

1104
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,340
Cider, pal.

1105
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,680
Really cheap.

1106
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,360
And it's nice.

1107
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,960
It goes down well.

1108
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:10,980
It's the apple cider.

1109
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:12,920
Can I have a drop?

1110
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,860
Can I have a drop?

1111
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,460

How much did you make today?

1117
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,280
Well, just epoxy 60 pence.

01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,040

Okay, I must be off now.

We're gonna go meet a female!

1123
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,300
Lucky day, lucky day!

1124
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,440
What's over here?

1125
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,800
A young pretty woman?

1126
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,960
Could it be mean, though?

1127
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,080
You think I'm young?

1128
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,980
What's over this side?

1129
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,900
Wait, maybe this is her car.

1130
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,780
Maybe if we break into it.

1131
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,160
Oh, just kidding.

1132
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,200
Phone a friend.

1133
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:35,570
Aren't you 19, yeah, but...

1134
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:37,610
How long have you been 19?

1135
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,430
A while.

1136
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:42,990
Twilight.

1137
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:44,910
What is this?

1138
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:45,910
Oreg army killer?

1139
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,290
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1140
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,210
Hello?

1141
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,190
Why is it so slow?

1142
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:00,190
I can't hear any dialing tone.

1143
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,670
Oh, because we have no money.

1144
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:04,190
We can't use it.

1145
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:09,720
Okay.

1146
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:10,520
Okay.

1147
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,700
So that's a...

1148
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,700
My grandfather once told me that no woman is ever older than 29.

1149
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,480
Your grandpa is a smart, smart man.

1150
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,520
Um, huh, maybe we try again.

1151
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,520
Wait, maybe we can take his...

1152
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,640
You think we have to, like, make it so that he goes to sleep?

1153
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,780
I don't know what to put in there.

1154
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:45,700
And then we take his money?

1155
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,780
Close due to renovation works.

1156
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,320
Great, and now?

1157
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:52,440
Or...

1158
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,340
Because I probably feel like we have to call somebody.

1159
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,680
Now you're thinking like Hal again.

1160
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,080
Let's try again.

1161
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,720
Let's try and steal his cash.

1162
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,140
What's he going to do, run after us?

1163
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:05,580
Here.

1164
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:06,860
Are you crazy?

1165
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:07,920
That's mine.

1166
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:08,960
Hands off, okay?

1167
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,060
I need to make a very important phone call.

1168
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,360
Okay, if I were...

1169
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:13,680
Wait!

1170
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:14,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1171
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,840
I have a bottle of something.

1172
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:18,700

1173
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:19,800

01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,380
Well, Halligan, how'd you get on at the museum?

1192
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,820
What did Professor Turner say?

1193
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,300
Could he help you?

1194
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,740
Oh, yeah, what are those flasks contained?

1195
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,140
Something I wanted to ask you, Chris.

1196
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,280
What do those flasks contain?

1197
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:49,940
Oh, you mean those on the shelves?

1198
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:50,280
Yeah.

1199
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,700
They contain all sorts of different chemicals I need for my work.

1200
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,120
I see.

1201
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,060
Indicator solutions.

1202
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:54,680
Alcohol.

1203
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:55,280
Alcohol.

1204
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:48,200

1206
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:13,560
Let's see.

1207
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,280
Try again.

1208
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,240
Okay, run here.

1209
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,740
Run, run, run, run, run.

1210
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:23,820
Okay, and I'll talk.

1211
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,580
Well, Halligan, how'd you get on at the museum?

1212
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,540
What did Professor Turner say?

1213
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,440
We need to get him to actually say like we're okay to...

1214
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:30,580
Okay.

1215
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,000
Yes.

1216
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,480
Something I wanted to ask you, Chris.

1217
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,680
What do those flasks contain?

1218
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,340
Third choice?

1219
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,160
Oh, you mean those on the shelves?

1220
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:38,580
Okay, thank you.

1221
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,920
I contain all sorts of different chemicals I need for my work.

1222
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,500
Clean the dust.

1223
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,140
Indicator solutions, alcohol, things like that.

1224
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,160
Oh, okay.

1225
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:45,820
This one.

1226
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:46,940
Why do you need alcohol?

1227
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,660
Why do you need alcohol for your work?

1228
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,780
Certainly not in order to drink it, Halligan.

1229
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,360
We use alcohols as solvents.

1230
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,060
Most types are poisonous anyway.

1231
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,140
And then you've got a great job, Chris.

1232
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,360
You've got a great job, Chris.

1233
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,020
Masses of alcohol and everything legal.

1234
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,420
Nonsense, Halligan.

1235
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,360
Do you think we spend all day getting drunk with medical alcohol?

1236
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,180
Why don't you just try this stuff?

1237
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,280
Oh, what will happen to me?

1238
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:13,300
What will happen to me then?

1239
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,180
You'll see.

1240
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,700
Well, how about it?

1241
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,160
Are you scared?

1242
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,200
I think he wants me.

1243
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,480
Sure, no problem.

1244
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,080
Sure, no problem.

1245
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,920
Oh, he's gonna give it to me!

1246
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,600
I think he wants to get me drunk.

1247
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,980
Okay, Chris.

1248
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:36,080
Oh!

1249
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,640
We're in no... These are some shiny forms.

1250
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,940
Here, Brent, to your health!

1251
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,540
To my health!

1252
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,040
What's up?

1253
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,700
Go ahead, try it!

1254
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,340
You won't go one of these so often.

1255
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,900
All right, here we go.

1256
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,040
Bottoms up!

1257
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:55,600
Cheers!

1258
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,360
Oh.

1259
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,080
To your health, Brent.

1260
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,140
An interesting aroma, isn't it?

1261
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,500
Brent, aren't you feeling very well?

1262
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,160
Brent, are you sure you're okay?

1263
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:10,900
Oh, God!

1264
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:55,140

Is it...

1270
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:18,230
It's not...

1271
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,470
There's nothing I can do with this.

1272
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,130
There's nothing I can do with this.

1273
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,130
I can't mix...

1274
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,550
Take it with me?

1275
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:25,790
Chris surely wouldn't like that.

1276
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:26,850
Chris isn't here.

1277
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,050
Who knows what's in it?

1278
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,610
Chris isn't here!

1279
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:35,050
Oh, Halligan needs to know which one the professor used.

1280
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:35,650
What?

1281
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,230
Wait, one second.

1282
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:39,650
I'm also going to save the game.

1283
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:41,210
Minto.

1284
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:42,650
Save.

1285
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:44,050
Yes.

1286
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,030
Okay, resume.

1287
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:49,650
All right, let's see.

1288
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:51,130
Look for powder.

1289
01:22:57,190 --> 01:22:58,390
Like on another shelf?

1290
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,490
I can't do anything with this.

1291
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,930
I can't even pronounce the name on the label right.

1292
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:09,990
I can't do anything.

1293
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:10,570
I can't do anything.

1294
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:19,470
I have the powder already.

1295
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:20,330
Wait, oh my gosh.

1296
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:52,210
It's so hard to tell what the stuff is in my inventory I don't think I have any powder do I oh this no not a chance just kidding no not a chance just kidding a matchbox still half full wait okay oh if I right-click it will it tell me what what is it fingerprint powder ah I see oh so if I right-click it it tells me what the thing is.

1297
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:54,590
Otherwise, I have no idea what I'm picking up.

1298
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:55,710
Okay, okay, okay.

1299
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:56,190
Awesome.

1300
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:57,450
Alright, then.

1301
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:03,030
Which is it?

1302
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:05,550
Whoa.

1303
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,550
Look what we've got here.

1304
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,270
This is the bottle Crystal.

1305
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:10,430
Okay.

1306
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:11,330
Perfect.

1307
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:12,070
Okay.

1308
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:13,090
Awesome.

1309
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,450
Or we can take it too.

1310
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,070
Aha!

1311
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,170
Okay.

1312
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,730
Then I combine.

1313
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:21,430
Aha!

1314
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,240
Yes!

1315
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,640
Alright, now let's go back to that guy.

1316
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,060
How you doing, Pies?

1317
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:33,500
Are you okay?

1318
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:33,640
Stop.

1319
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,000
I don't think it's a good idea to take the bottle out of the lab.

1320
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,500
Chris will be back quite soon.

1321
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,920
Okay, okay, okay.

1322
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,980
He'll also notice all the powder that's like on the shelf.

1323
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,100
You don't want to clean that up?

1324
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:45,400
No?

1325
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:45,780
Okay.

1326
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:50,960
Why is 90% of the department's budget spent on supertests to a big phantom?

1327
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:58,090
Don't play- Right!

1328
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,270
Let's go knock a guy out!

1329
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:02,030
Turn a homeless person?

1330
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,910
He won't die.

1331
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:07,010
He won't.

1332
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,810
He won't.

1333
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,520
He won't.

1334
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:15,860
Run.

1335
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:18,620
There we go.

1336
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,080
Sometimes the way he walks in slow motion is so funny.

1337
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:24,340
Hi, mister.

1338
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,400
Hello, old friend.

1339
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,700
Okay, I did just a tiny bit.

1340
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,720
This guy is probably not a lightweight.

1341
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:52,760
he'll be fine I've got something for you Apple snaps from detective Halligan's home distillery my own brand would you like to have a taste you serious all right pal I'm as dry as the bottom of a parrot's cage why don't you drink it all I don't mind and it's a cracker I can tell you cheers mr.

1342
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:56,160
cheers oh

1343
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:10,900
he's snoring you guys he's snoring I could hear him So we could steal $0.60 from a...

1344
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,840
We need to make a phone call.

1345
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,360
It's very important.

1346
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,120
I wish I had a snack for this game.

1347
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,680
I kind of want some cheeses.

1348
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,180
I have some.

1349
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,460
I just have to go get them.

1350
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,460
Okay.

1351
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,380
What shall I pay for?

1352
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:29,940
The phone call?

1353
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:30,780
What shall I pay for?

1354
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:31,660
What shall I pay for?

1355
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,440
You can't get through like that.

1356
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:34,460
What are you talking about?

1357
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,260
There we go.

1358
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,380
This game is so obtuse.

1359
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,740
I can't hear any dialing tone.

1360
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:41,980
Yes, now I pay.

1361
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,040
Now I...

1362
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,260
What shall I pay for?

1363
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,040
Oh, here we, in here.

1364
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:46,920
What shall I pay for?

1365
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,780
What shall I pay for?

1366
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,320
Right here.

1367
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,840
There we go.

1368
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:55,790
Which number am I supposed to dial?

1369
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:58,830
Uh...

1370
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:01,830
Which number am I supposed to dial?

1371
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:08,580
Uh...

1372
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:09,660
Uh...

1373
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,500
Now he's dead.

1374
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:13,760
No, he's not!

1375
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:15,980
Wait.

1376
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:19,600
I can't- it won't let me read this.

1377
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,180
For some reason.

1378
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,680
It won't work without money.

1379
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:31,340
Um...

1380
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,200
Wait, no, no, no, no!

1381
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:33,300
I tried to click the books!

1382
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,540
No, no, go back in, go back in.

1383
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,420
It still is working, right?

1384
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,920
I didn't like soft- okay, we have the money back.

1385
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:44,180
Okay.

1386
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,400
Ah, here we go, here we go, here we go.

1387
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:49,800
Hmm.

1388
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,200
Let's see if the phone number of the museum is listed in here.

1389
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:53,600
Yes, yes.

1390
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,780
Muse, Muse, Muse, Museum, Museum, Museum.

1391
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:02,060
Museum of African Studies, Museum of Ancient History.

1392
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,060
Here, Anthropological Museum.

1393
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:04,400
Okay.

1394
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,420
And the extension of Professor Turner?

1395
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,120
It's here.

1396
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:07,900
I've got it.

1397
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:08,200
Aha!

1398
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,780
Oh my gosh, easy peasy.

1399
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:43,910
I would hate to, you know, hate if someone's if I don't want someone to bother hello who's that who am I speaking to this is detective Halligan from Scotland yard this is detective Halligan from Scotland yard Scotland yard what can I do for you I need to speak to professor Turner doesn't he work at the museum yes but he's away on business miss what was your name look miss what was your name goodbye mr.

1400
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,310
Halligan wait she's hung up

1401
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:50,630
Did I mess up?

1402
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:54,630
I just wanted your name.

1403
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:56,650
You can't get through like that.

1404
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:01,710
Maybe if I go back urgently, Halligan.

1405
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:02,510
Run, run!

1406
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:06,410
What was her name?

1407
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:08,190
Brizzless?

1408
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:09,070
I've tried.

1409
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:13,840
I have...

1410
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,020
Oh, I do have money still, so I could try again.

1411
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:17,960
Ma'am!

1412
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:19,780
Okay, let's try again.

1413
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:19,940
Locked.

1414
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,740
Okay, I didn't realize.

1415
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,240
I thought it took the money.

1416
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,320
We're running, running, running.

1417
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,690
Oh, so we could talk to a lady.

1418
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,030
We killed a guy.

1419
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:36,710
I think that's the bro code, no?

1420
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:43,470
Like, I die for you to talk to a lady, right?

1421
01:29:43,730 --> 01:29:44,970
I don't know the bro code.

1422
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:50,740
It is?

1423
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,240
Okay, good.

1424
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:53,720
Hello, it's me again, Detective Halligan.

1425
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,760
Professor Turner isn't here.

1426
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,060
Yes, but...

1427
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,260
Detective, I'm very busy.

1428
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,840
Please call again in eight weeks.

1429
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,680
Are you pregnant?

1430
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,560
Oh, wait, that's eight months.

1431
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:04,640
Oh, gosh.

1432
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,500
Imagine playing this game without chat to help you.

1433
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,080
I'm getting soft logs without warning.

1434
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,940
Weeks of fun, they weren't alike.

1435
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,520
Right?

1436
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,460
My goodness.

1437
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,340
Wait, please.

1438
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,900
I'm a desperate man.

1439
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,020
You aren't drunk enough for this game.

1440
01:30:41,050 --> 01:31:43,380
okay one more time hello hello it's me again detective Halligan I told you professor Turner isn't here yes yes I'm very busy please call again in eight weeks but I she's hung up again oh okay I'll try one more time what is this thing anyway one more time one more time I have enough money hello hello it's me again detective haligan i told you professor turner isn't here yes but detective i'm very busy please call again in eight weeks but i she's hung up again oh okay all right have we considered the skeleton murders may might not be murders but in fact self-inflicted that is a possibility anything could be a pot they say sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.

1441
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:45,860
They do say that.

1442
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,480
Okay, I saw someone say go back to the Scotland Yard.

1443
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,300
So that's where we're at, baby.

1444
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,180
And we're going to get ourselves a drink.

1445
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,320
I've got no money for that.

1446
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:57,660
Um, excuse me.

1447
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,340
What shall I pay for?

1448
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,940
Oh, come on.

1449
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:07,860
I think...

1450
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:14,030
Because maybe he knows her too.

1451
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:16,790
Hello.

1452
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,790
Well, Brent, still got a headache.

1453
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,270
Don't ask, Chris.

1454
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:22,210
Have you managed to contact Professor Turner?

1455
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:24,070
Yeah, I phoned him, but he wasn't in.

1456
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:24,790
Not in?

1457
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:25,790
He's on an expedition.

1458
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:28,350
I just talked to some woman who works there.

1459
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:29,910
With his extension number.

1460
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:30,830
Yeah, exactly.

1461
01:32:31,230 --> 01:32:33,530
Well, Halligan, that was probably his daughter, Melanie.

1462
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:35,370
She works in the museum as well.

1463
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,010
My friend told me a lot about her.

1464
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,850
He used to be really keen on her.

1465
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:41,070
So, Professor Turner has a daughter.

1466
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,970
Thanks, Chris.

1467
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:43,110
I think that'll help.

1468
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:46,450
All right, all the way back, baby.

1469
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:48,090
Let's go.

1470
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:53,810
Is this the true work of a detective just running back and forth, like actually running?

1471
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:57,030
Just running and running?

1472
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,750
Cute name, Melanie.

1473
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:03,830
Is she single?

1474
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:05,990
I think we're gonna romance her.

1475
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,310
I just ran into the car.

1476
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:16,770
Okay.

1477
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:17,690
Okay.

1478
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:19,470
All right.

1479
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:21,450
Fifth time's the charm.

1480
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:23,230
Melanie.

1481
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:25,990
Hello?

1482
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,650
Hello, this is Halligan again.

1483
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:29,390
Please don't hang up, Miss Turner.

1484
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:31,130
How do you know my name, Mr. Halligan?

1485
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,710
Chris Hecker told me that Professor Turner's your father.

1486
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:34,730
Yes, that's true.

1487
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:35,990
What do you do at the museum?

1488
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,090
I'm an anthropologist.

1489
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:38,210
The same as your father.

1490
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:38,970
Yes?

1491
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:41,570
Miss Turner, do you think you could help me?

1492
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:42,310
That depends.

1493
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:44,410
Why would she hang up on the Scotland Yard anyway?

1494
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:46,150
I found a bone that I've had examined at the lab.

1495
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:46,750
A bone?

1496
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:47,770
A human bone?

1497
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,530
Human bones.

1498
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:50,750
Belong to a murder victim.

1499
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:51,130
Murder?

1500
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:52,430
How awful.

1501
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:55,430
The bone is from the body of one of the victims of the skeleton murders.

1502
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:56,870
I take it you've read about them.

1503
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:58,190
Oh, good heavens, yes.

1504
01:33:58,290 --> 01:33:59,550
What can I do for you?

1505
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,090
Couldn't we discuss that inside?

1506
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:01,630
Certainly.

1507
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:02,470
Come on over.

1508
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:03,410
I'll let you in.

1509
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:07,630
Yes, yes.

1510
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:10,110
I want this thing, whatever it is.

1511
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:11,750
All right, run, Halligan.

1512
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:15,050
Oh, oh, she's waiting for me.

1513
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:16,570
I mustn't keep a lady waiting.

1514
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:25,430
successful yes mr.

1515
01:34:25,570 --> 01:35:01,010
Halligan yes that's right hello miss Turner she got that Laura Cropfield no problem we're closed anyway the museum is being refurbished it's not easy to get in touch with you I was close to giving up oh I mean because of the phone call I'm really sorry I do sometimes tend to be rather short on the phone no I get unpleasant calls sometimes and that's why I'm a bit suspicious I see well I finally got in touch with you would you like to come in would you like a cup of coffee or anything else no thanks mr.

1516
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:47,990
Halligan how may I help you as I said I'm working on the skeleton murders we found another victim in Epping Forest all the evidence points to the same culprit as in the other cases the corpse was completely skeletonized professional that's horrible but how can I help you my colleague Chris Hecker of the forensic lab has already had a look at the bones he thought that your father could perhaps carry out some additional tests he is a renowned expert after all yes he could do that but as I said my father isn't here I know but it is very urgent perhaps you could have a look hmm you say you've got some of the bones with you yes just one just like my ears this is a femur yes that's what Chris Hecker said maybe we keep it in the bag.

1517
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:49,130
It would take some time, Mr. Halligan.

1518
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,390
Could you wait a moment?

1519
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:56,210
What is this lo-fi version of the song?

1520
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:59,630
Um, I would like to ask some questions about your work.

1521
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:02,110
I would like to ask you some questions about your work.

1522
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,850
Just out of interest.

1523
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:08,650
Oh, well, uh, what's your research field?

1524
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:09,870
What's your research field?

1525
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:11,970
I specialize in sacrificial rights.

1526
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,450
Sacrificial rights?

1527
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,470
That's an unusual research field for a young woman.

1528
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:17,090
Do you think so?

1529
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,830
Such is like a sacrifice.

1530
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:22,050
I don't think you should divide preferred science fields for men or women, Mr. Halligan.

1531
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,730
No, I didn't mean it like that.

1532
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:24,170
Participated?

1533
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:28,410
I just think that you must have to do with death all the time if you research sacrifices.

1534
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:30,670
Death is part of our existence, Mr. Halligan.

1535
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,330
In all cultures, all around the world.

1536
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:33,930
You're telling me.

1537
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:35,110
Thank you so much for the fine good then.

1538
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:37,870
If you take it like that, we are almost like colleagues.

1539
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:38,450
Maybe.

1540
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:41,310
But it's not my job to put people in jail.

1541
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:46,750
I document the sacrificial rights of different cultures in order to help create a better mutual understanding.

1542
01:36:47,110 --> 01:37:41,470

She runs like Yuna, Final Fantasy 10-2.

1544
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:49,340
Okay.

1545
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,160
I want to go get cheeses.

1546
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:52,300
Do you guys mind?

1547
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,740
I'm just gonna get some cheeses.

1548
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:59,160
Actually, I need some more water anyway, so...

1549
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,580
I will be...

1550
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,360
One moment.

1551
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:04,500
And also, I'm gonna let my cat out.

1552
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,780
You've been so patient, little girl.

1553
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,540
You're so sweet.

1554
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,720
Yeah, you've been so patient, wanting...

1555
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,700
Yeah, you've just been laying on the ground.

1556
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,440
Look at your clothes in your eyes.

1557
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,580
You're so sweet.

1558
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,240
You're the sweetest girl ever, ever, ever.

1559
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,060
I love you.

1560
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:24,280
No, yeah, you have RBF, but that's why you're so cute.

1561
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,220
Okay, there we go.

1562
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,440
I'm back.

1563
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:05,660
Okay.

1564
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,660
Let's do science.

1565
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,060
I got cheeses.

1566
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,500
I'm ready to do science.

1567
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:15,860
Father.

1568
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:48,500

1569
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,000
Thank you so much guys.

1570
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:50,280
Thank you.

1571
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:50,880
Thank you.

1572
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,200
Let's put a bow in here.

1573
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:03,120
Okay.

1574
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,320
Can't wait for her to get to the salt arc.

1575
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:10,340
I don't know what that means.

1576
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,040
It looks just like her.

1577
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:15,620
What's over here?

1578
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,100
Oh, what's this?

1579
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,100
Whoa!

1580
01:41:17,640 --> 01:42:04,500

1581
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:46,040

1582
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:49,180
This one's spooky.

1583
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,800
Nice view for Halloween.

1584
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,600
She's still there.

1585
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,120
Oh, wait.

1586
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,460
There's nothing here to, like, open.

1587
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,280
What else?

1588
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:07,920
Oh, what's here?

1589
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,040
This side.

1590
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:15,120
The head of a Greek statue.

1591
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,340
I keep forgetting these pieces fit together.

1592
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,440
But my father and I never managed to figure out where they came from.

1593
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,060
I need the right click for like the description.

1594
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:25,440
These sculptures don't belong here.

1595
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:28,120
I bought them from a junk dealer for just 20 pounds.

1596
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,500
I ought to take them home with me.

1597
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,220
I'll put them in the living room.

1598
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:34,360
A sanity effect like a turtle dying is right.

1599
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:35,740
These sculptures don't belong here.

1600
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,380
I bought them.

1601
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:36,980
Okay.

1602
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,580
This statue is from North Africa.

1603
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,160
I think it represents the God of the Earth.

1604
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:42,900
Whoa.

1605
01:43:43,180 --> 01:44:14,340
was there anything else over here uh besides the machine no oh she's gone it's so spooky the sickles from england it could be a celtic artifact but we haven't been able to date it yet that's a stiletto from the late roman era this dagger needs restoring a curved dagger i think father brought it back with him from Turkey.

1606
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,840
These stilettos were found during the excavations in Tenochtitlan which is now Mexico City.

1607
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,620
Yes, but it happens in real life.

1608
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,720
These stilettos were antique muzzleloader pistols.

1609
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,640
Pieces of broken vessels.

1610
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,960
It must have been practically impossible to aim these things properly.

1611
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:31,780
Probably.

1612
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,360
She's back!

1613
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:37,640
My voice scared me!

1614
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:42,200
I know this game I saw someone review this idea.

1615
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:42,760
Yeah!

1616
01:44:52,690 --> 01:44:54,830
Was there anything here?

1617
01:44:55,150 --> 01:44:57,210
Maybe I just didn't observe well enough.

1618
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:00,390
Anything?

1619
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:02,830
Like, why else would we be able to look over here?

1620
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:04,670
No, nothing?

1621
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:05,230
Okay.

1622
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:07,530
What about in here?

1623
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:09,330
Two bottles of developer.

1624
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:11,210
Developer, like, for pictures?

1625
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:12,710
The wash basin.

1626
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:13,890
Yes.

1627
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:17,090
There's no point in that.

1628
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:41,790
tile as well a wash basin what do i do with this little scrap um let's check here father's distiller okay these are pieces of very old statues it's not easy to put them together microscope i don't see one though oh wait oh my gosh okay

1629
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:51,850
I can't see a thing.

1630
01:45:52,090 --> 01:45:52,510
Yeah, I know.

1631
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:56,550
I can't really, like, adjust it that well, either.

1632
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:04,330
Try using the item on the items on the weapon table.

1633
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:11,700
I won't get anywhere that...

1634
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:12,760
No, not a chance.

1635
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,020
It won't work like that.

1636
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:15,480
I don't want that.

1637
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,280
I'd better think about it again.

1638
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:18,900
Or this one?

1639
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,500
There's no point.

1640
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:23,480
It's lucky nobody saw that.

1641
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,240
Do I have to...

1642
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,700
It didn't give me an op...

1643
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:27,340
Let me try.

1644
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:30,520
The bone.

1645
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:31,960
Ah, there we go.

1646
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,560
What is that?

1647
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,720
Do-do-do.

1648
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:40,600
I can't see it properly.

1649
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,320
No.

1650
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,600
Wait, I went too far.

1651
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,380
Okay, here we go.

1652
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:46,400
Do-do-do.

1653
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,060
I can't see it properly.

1654
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:48,580
Yes, you can.

1655
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:49,400
Don't lie.

1656
01:46:50,060 --> 01:47:12,740
some metal residue here it's gold there's some metal residue here gold metal residue gold okay she's back made any progress yes a little but I can't quite make it out have you got a moment I just want to check on something sure no

1657
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,260
Okay.

1658
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,280
Made any progress?

1659
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:24,520
Yes, a little, but I can't quite make it out.

1660
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,540
Have you got a moment?

1661
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,620
I just want to check on something.

1662
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:28,720
Sure, no problem.

1663
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:31,540
Sure.

1664
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,180
A relief.

1665
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:35,360
It's just come back from the Restorer.

1666
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,080
I still control her.

1667
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,000
Save the game.

1668
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:42,860
You're so right.

1669
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:51,170
Actually, we'll do Minto too, just in case.

1670
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,100
Can I leave?

1671
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,620
Let me...

1672
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:07,160
Let's look at this real quick.

1673
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,120
Let's look at some of the other things that...

1674
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,040
Okay, we'll look at that.

1675
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:11,700
Okay, we'll look at this.

1676
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:17,760
This mask is worn for New Year's celebrations in New Guinea.

1677
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:20,480
I got this mask in Central Africa.

1678
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:55,300
to cure diseases they're witch doctors use them to drive away evil spirits a Mexican God he's obviously hungry and only human sacrifices will satisfy him same a small statue a small Greek statue this is from Easter Island very mysterious a death mask in the Sudan they put masks like these on warriors who died while hunting I'd like to know how my Father got hold of this silver mask from Kenya.

1679
01:48:56,660 --> 01:49:01,040
Masks like this one are worn by tribal chieftains for initiation ceremonies.

1680
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:01,640
Hmm.

1681
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:02,400
Okay.

1682
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:04,060
She's not gone.

1683
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,060
Okay, hold on.

1684
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,720
It's lucky nobody saw that.

1685
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,680
Nah, don't think.

1686
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,320
Father's distiller.

1687
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,280
I think we gotta have him...

1688
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:15,880
Oh, gosh.

1689
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,900
How do I get her to leave?

1690
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,760
How do I get her doppelganger to leave?

1691
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,380
Pieces of broken vessels.

1692
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:23,980
Um...

1693
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,800
That's a stiletto from the late...

1694
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,500
No!

1695
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:28,940
Uh...

1696
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:30,460
Uh...

1697
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,700
I'm going to like everything that...

1698
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:36,460
Oh gosh, okay, let's try again.

1699
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:38,360
Made any progress?

1700
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:41,580
Yes, a little, but I can't quite make it out.

1701
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,640
Have you got a moment?

1702
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:44,720
I just want to check on something.

1703
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,840
Sure, no problem.

1704
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,660
Restart the save?

1705
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:48,500
Okay, let's try.

1706
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:49,640
Load.

1707
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,060
Ow!

1708
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,060
Forbidden archaeologies, my favorite.

1709
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:03,920
Excellent research.

1710
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:05,360
Very mysterious.

1711
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,060
She is permanent.

1712
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,160
Oh, people are saying she doesn't matter.

1713
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,140
Oh, really?

1714
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:11,860
Okay.

1715
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:14,080
So there's something about...

1716
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,960
Okay, so I need to...

1717
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,940
Wait, then what do I have him look at?

1718
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:24,620
Paragon, Paragon.

1719
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:28,800
I'll never get the bone under there.

1720
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,800
Do I need to...

1721
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:34,240
Maybe...

1722
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,760
Hold on.

1723
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:36,660
Is it like something here?

1724
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,640
Something gold?

1725
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,100
It won't work like that, I don't think.

1726
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:44,600
Would that really be clever?

1727
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:46,680
That doesn't work.

1728
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,120
That won't get me any further.

1729
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:50,760
There's no point in that.

1730
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,440
Oh, the tweezers.

1731
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:54,940
Oh.

1732
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:01,460
all right i don't i tried grabbing them before but i could oh we're good

1733
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:35,850
okay i yeah tweezers were a good guess okay she's back um is it so let's see anything else on the desk uh

1734
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:40,510
It's kind of creepy.

1735
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:41,510
What's here?

1736
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:42,610
Okay.

1737
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:45,890
Um...

1738
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:48,410
Uh...

1739
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:51,450
Every copy of the game is personalized.

1740
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:54,750
Bone on the tweezers!

1741
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:55,230
Oh!

1742
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,510
Oh yeah, maybe let's try.

1743
01:51:56,570 --> 01:51:58,270
Well, it didn't give me...

1744
01:51:58,270 --> 01:51:59,070
Oh, whoops, my bad.

1745
01:51:59,150 --> 01:51:59,670
Wrong thing.

1746
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:06,150
It didn't give me the option to interact with the tweezers at all, so I'm not sure if it'll let us do that, but we can try.

1747
01:52:07,670 --> 01:52:08,070
No.

1748
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:24,730
I think I tried interacting with all of these.

1749
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:25,630
Hmm.

1750
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:26,090
Nothing's happened.

1751
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:27,170
It won't work like that.

1752
01:52:27,390 --> 01:52:28,690
I should concentrate.

1753
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:29,790
Is there anything?

1754
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:31,370
Oh, maybe over here.

1755
01:52:34,070 --> 01:52:35,550
That could get it out.

1756
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:35,990
No.

1757
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:43,950
Would that really be clever?

1758
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:48,690
Maybe I don't feel like I have to use this, but...

1759
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:49,750
Wanted up to a scam.

1760
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,330
Yeah.

1761
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:51,210
It won't work.

1762
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:52,250
That won't get me any...

1763
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,370
It won't work like that.

1764
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:55,430
That won't get me any further.

1765
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:57,470
The wash basin.

1766
01:52:57,710 --> 01:53:00,010
The wash basin.

1767
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:05,660
That's futile as well.

1768
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,280
Is it...

1769
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,240
The wash basin.

1770
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,720
Um...

1771
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:11,040
Hmm.

1772
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,160
Ah.

1773
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:18,040
The wash basin.

1774
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:19,180
The wash basin.

1775
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,920
There was nothing in here to interact with.

1776
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,860
Can you, that's what I was trying to do was plug the sink with this, but it just, she just says the wash basin.

1777
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,780
She just says the wash basin.

1778
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,340
I didn't think, because that looks like the plug, no, that's what I thought.

1779
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:46,840
Big bone on sickle.

1780
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,240
Really?

1781
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:50,860
The big bone?

1782
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:52,700
Hmm.

1783
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,300
That's interesting.

1784
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:57,180
The notches in the bone were made by a sharp instrument.

1785
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:00,420
The sickle matches the notches to a T.

1786
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,480
How are you supposed to know that?

1787
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,340
Okay, mister.

1788
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:08,760
Made any progress?

1789
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,960
Yes, a little, but I can't quite make it out.

1790
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:13,020
Have you got a moment?

1791
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,100
I just want to check on something.

1792
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:16,200
Sure, no problem.

1793
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,980
Okay, there's more we gotta do!

1794
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:19,460
Okay.

1795
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:20,600
Ha!

1796
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:23,620
This is the weeks they talked about!

1797
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:30,140
Like, that's why I tried the piece to be like, oh, any of these metals kind of like mad.

1798
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:31,340
There's no point in that.

1799
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:31,940
Okay.

1800
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,180
The magazine.

1801
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:41,500
Hey, didn't this edition mention something in connection with sacrificial rights in Britain?

1802
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,500
Why didn't you bring that up sooner?

1803
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,420
Let's see.

1804
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:45,660
Yes, here it is.

1805
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:49,080
An article about the druids and their sacrificial rights.

1806
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:53,580
Findings indicate that in ancient England, it was probable for the most...

1807
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:58,580
Ah, for their high ceremonies, the Celts usually prefer to use...

1808
01:54:58,580 --> 01:54:59,900
Hmm, incredible.

1809
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:01,240
Think about what you're trying to achieve.

1810
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,420
What fits in with this bone?

1811
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:05,200
I'm sure the detective will be very interested.

1812
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:06,960
The Druids!

1813
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:08,080
The Druids!

1814
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:12,220
Okay, our house is haunted and also...

1815
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:12,860
Mr. Halligan?

1816
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:13,540
The Druids.

1817
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:15,020
Oh!

1818
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,620
I believe I found something interesting about your bone.

1819
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,240
ahead.

1820
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,720
In my opinion this bone was worked on.

1821
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:23,880
With a sickle?

1822
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:27,220
Yes, and probably with a sickle made of gold.

1823
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,400
What makes you think that?

1824
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,640
The bone bears notches matching the cutting form of a sickle to a tee.

1825
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,520
And I found a trace of gold in one of the notches.

1826
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,920
A golden sickle?

1827
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:40,660
Who would use a weapon like that in order to cut a human being to pieces?

1828
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,580
That's what I asked myself as well.

1829
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:45,760
I found an interesting article which could help us.

1830
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:51,700
According to the historian Arthur Blake, the Britannic druids carried out very bloody sacrificial rites.

1831
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,620
He found out that such rites took place at major celebrations of the Celts.

1832
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,500
He assumes that consecrated golden sickles were used for those rites.

1833
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,280
And how does he know about these things?

1834
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,880
He learned about it from old inscriptions he's translating at the moment.

1835
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:05,920
Interesting, huh?

1836
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:06,620
Interesting.

1837
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:07,920
Celts?

1838
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:08,980
Druids?

1839
01:56:09,900 --> 01:56:12,180
Quite some time has passed since then, hasn't it?

1840
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:17,320
Of course, but the descriptions in the article absolutely match the findings on your bone, Mr. Halligan.

1841
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:19,760
I'm sure the author of the article can help you.

1842
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:22,960
Case, happy birthday!

1843
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,260
Oh, what do you think?

1844
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:27,640
Could this Blake be right?

1845
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:31,820
What do you think?

1846
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:33,380
Could this Blake be right?

1847
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,180
I don't know.

1848
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:40,840
Maybe he just wants to make money with horror stories about ancient Britain, but the bone you've shown me would match his theory quite well.

1849
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:44,240
Have you seen anything similar?

1850
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,800
This murder could...

1851
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,380
Do you think this murder could be a ritual murder?

1852
01:56:49,020 --> 01:57:03,360
murder could be a ritual murder yes it would be possible there are several occult sects and Satanists they like checking their history books and adopting archaic rituals have you ever seen anything similar in your career oh mr.

1853
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:19,680
Halligan you don't know the Aztec scar walls oh seen those you'd consider your bone harmless maybe but that was centuries ago the victim of this murder was found this morning and it was found in London found in London Okay.

1854
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:21,340
All right, team.

1855
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,600
I think we have to go talk to that guy, right?

1856
01:57:23,780 --> 01:57:24,780
What did you say the author's name was?

1857
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,280
What did you say this author's name was?

1858
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:26,900
Blake.

1859
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,020
Arthur Blake.

1860
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:28,300
Arthur Blake.

1861
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:31,280
Was there any mention in the article of how you could get in touch with the man?

1862
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:32,580
I thought you'd ask that.

1863
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:34,880
His address was printed below the article.

1864
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:37,740
366 Pinewood Road, Northampton.

1865
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,740
They're just doxing this man's address in a magazine.

1866
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,260
Anybody can buy a magazine.

1867
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:44,540
What?

1868
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:45,260
Okay.

1869
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,340
I'm going there now.

1870
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,860
Mr. Halligan, I'm interested in this.

1871
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,560
particularly because of my job.

1872
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:52,300
I'd like to help you with your case.

1873
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:53,780
Would you take me with you?

1874
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,360
It was a different time, truly.

1875
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:56,880
It's confidential police work.

1876
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:58,620
I have to see him on my own.

1877
01:57:58,800 --> 01:57:59,520
No, no, no.

1878
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,420
I'm sure my knowledge would be to your advantage, Mr. Halligan.

1879
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:05,880
And I think it would be really interesting to work on a case like that.

1880
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:06,340
Hmm.

1881
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:10,840
Oh, when I think about it, perhaps that's not a bad idea at all.

1882
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:14,100
Perhaps there will be more examinations to be done.

1883
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:14,460
Yes.

1884
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,080
Okay, Ms. Turner, let's do it like this.

1885
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:18,660
I'll keep you informed on the case.

1886
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:22,120
If I hear anything new or if I need your help, I'll contact you.

1887
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:23,340
What do you think?

1888
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:23,840
All right.

1889
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:25,120
I'll see you later, then.

1890
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:25,480
Yeah.

1891
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:26,400
See you later.

1892
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,520
And thank you, Ms. Turner.

1893
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:30,120
Thank you, Ms. Turner.

1894
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,140
All right, baby.

1895
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,220
Is this guy...

1896
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:37,040
I guess we should check up on...

1897
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,540
He's probably still snoring.

1898
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:42,660
Yep.

1899
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,700
He's totally fine, everybody.

1900
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:48,460
He can...

1901
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:49,000
He is...

1902
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:50,740
but not a lightweight like all of you.

1903
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,400
We're going to Arthur Blake.

1904
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:56,200
Pretty out of the way.

1905
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:56,800
Wow.

1906
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:58,520
Cute little place.

1907
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:00,120
What we got around here.

1908
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,560
We got his car.

1909
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:06,360
Mr. Blake's vehicle really is a vintage car.

1910
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:07,240
That's for certain.

1911
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:09,480
Looks like he made this letterbox himself.

1912
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,780
Oh, he's a handyman.

1913
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,080
How'd you come to my place and have a chat if you liked the article, right?

1914
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:27,330
ping-pong it is mr.

1915
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:51,770
Blake yes my name's Brent Halligan I'm a detective from Scotland yard I have a few questions I need to ask you Scotland yard what's this about is something wrong hello I'm American my name is Blake I come in I'm not sure what's happened is there a problem with one of my publications no no sir I'm investigating a murder case perhaps you could help me it really won't Murder.

1916
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:53,210
How awful.

1917
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:54,170
Murder.

1918
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:55,770
But what's it got to do with me?

1919
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:59,250
Mr. Blake, I'd really prefer if we could go somewhere a little more private.

1920
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:00,730
May I come in?

1921
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:01,690
Yes, certainly.

1922
02:00:02,490 --> 02:00:02,990
Come on in.

1923
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:07,970
I love the way Hannigan kind of puts his arms behind his back and like goes on his tippy toes.

1924
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:12,290
Like he's like saying like, please, please may I come in?

1925
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:14,510
Wait, he's gonna do it.

1926
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:17,230
Wow, the music in here is nice.

1927
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:22,750
Scotland forever.

1928
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:25,890
Is Mint playing with a guide?

1929
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:27,590
Yeah, chats my god.

1930
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:30,170
Big bong bong.

1931
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:31,390
Cool.

1932
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:34,270
An old pendulum clock with a Roman face.

1933
02:00:35,730 --> 02:00:36,630
What do you got in your drawers?

1934
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:38,530
Mr. Blake seems to be a man of taste.

1935
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:40,650
Still, I wouldn't buy a thing like that.

1936
02:00:50,330 --> 02:00:51,330
Oh my god!

1937
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:54,550
I thought that we were so chill for like...

1938
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:55,850
I'd better not sit down.

1939
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:57,610
Might create a bad impression.

1940
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:59,970
The armchair looks really comfortable.

1941
02:00:59,970 --> 02:01:01,810
I could do with one of them in my office.

1942
02:01:08,130 --> 02:01:11,250
This sounded like Owoni up in here.

1943
02:01:11,870 --> 02:01:12,630
A lot of books.

1944
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:13,470
A lot of books.

1945
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:15,270
And they're almost all historical works.

1946
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:18,190
A lot of books.

1947
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:22,250
Wee!

1948
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:24,830
Okay, where it stops is the next place we're going.

1949
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:28,210
The sea!

1950
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:30,890
Next stop.

1951
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:34,290
Heading to...

1952
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:35,290
Canada!

1953
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:39,370
That's a pretty good map of the world, considering how old it is.

1954
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:42,450
We're going to Canada, baby.

1955
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:45,750
Hello.

1956
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:49,930
You're the author of a book on druids, am I right?

1957
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:51,310
Yes, quite correct.

1958
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:55,110
In fact, I'm just working on a revised version for the next edition.

1959
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:57,830
But what makes you so interested in my book?

1960
02:01:58,050 --> 02:02:00,790
I'm currently investigating a series of murders in London.

1961
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:13,570
some interesting discoveries that I'd like to discuss with you what series of murders are we talking about the skeleton murders you may have read about them in the papers oh yes of course a terrible business mr.

1962
02:02:13,610 --> 02:02:32,770
Blake I believe there may be some sort of ritual behind these murders what makes you think that dr. Turner from the Anthropological Museum in Oxford examined one of the last victims bones for me she found residual traces of gold on it and round notches round Does that mean anything to you?

1963
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:37,650
Doesn't your book on druids mention ritual killings, for which a golden sickle was used?

1964
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:38,090
True.

1965
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:42,750
Are you saying these murders are based on the same ritual?

1966
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:44,270
That's what I've come to ask you.

1967
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:45,330
But that's impossible.

1968
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:45,770
Oh.

1969
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:47,030
It can't be true.

1970
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:49,910
It's my God.

1971
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:52,390
It would be unthinkable.

1972
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:52,850
Unthinkable?

1973
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:54,970
It would confirm all my translations.

1974
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:58,230
I've been researching the history of the druids for 30 years now.

1975
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:01,410
But I've never yet found proof of my greatest failure.

1976
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:01,830
Fears.

1977
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:03,390
Your greatest fears.

1978
02:03:03,670 --> 02:03:03,970
Yes.

1979
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:06,290
The perfection of the final ritual.

1980
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:09,410
The final confirmation of the Druid's power.

1981
02:03:11,570 --> 02:03:13,090
I turned the music down.

1982
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:17,350
If I hadn't, it would be like just completely overshadowing.

1983
02:03:17,730 --> 02:03:18,610
Tell me more about the Druids.

1984
02:03:18,690 --> 02:03:20,050
What's this final ritual, yeah?

1985
02:03:20,110 --> 02:03:22,050
What's this final ritual all about?

1986
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:25,650
This is the text I wrote down during my travels through England and France.

1987
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:33,010
You know, when you travel through the country, you can feel that many locals still believe in the old Celtic customs.

1988
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:39,170
A group of farmers in the south of England let me copy the inscriptions on a megalith that stands in a field there.

1989
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:43,290
They claim that there used to be a huge druid temple close to their house.

1990
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:45,290
But there's nothing left of it now.

1991
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:45,970
Frantz.

1992
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:49,390
I managed to translate the text, at least in part.

1993
02:03:49,610 --> 02:03:51,570
Okay, Mr. Blake, please come to the point.

1994
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:52,890
Oh my God, you asked him!

1995
02:03:53,030 --> 02:04:00,050
It says that the last of the druids saw the fall of their priesthood coming in the year 1000 AD.

1996
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:03,670
surrounding the final destruction of the order.

1997
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:16,130
A demonic superior druid seized power, using his knowledge of druid magic, not for the good of his people, man to honor the gods, but to submit all of mankind to his rule.

1998
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:16,450
No.

1999
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:29,510
In order to secure the survival of the druid's tradition, and to complete his devilish work, he organized a final ritual, transferring the knowledge and power of the last of the druids to five infants.

2000
02:04:29,650 --> 02:04:30,430
Oh, the babies!

2001
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:33,530
as the inheritors.

2002
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,270
Go on.

2003
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:38,810
The inscription says that the ritual was not entirely completed.

2004
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:40,710
I've not yet been able to discover why.

2005
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:48,350
But from what I've learned, the inheritors are strong and powerful enough to one day complete the ritual by themselves.

2006
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:49,590
Says our movements.

2007
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:55,270
Right, but what do these murders have to do with the myth?

2008
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:56,290
Right.

2009
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,830
What have these murders got to do with the myth?

2010
02:04:59,050 --> 02:05:00,210
That's just it, Mr. Halligan.

2011
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:02,310
I haven't told you the whole story yet.

2012
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:03,030
Then get on with it!

2013
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:03,650
Yes.

2014
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:11,730
The inscriptions explain that the Druids' inheritors require the life force of other people to complete the ritual.

2015
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:12,370
I see.

2016
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:14,230
And how do they do that?

2017
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:20,830
According to legend, the flesh has to be cut off the bones of living humans and to be eaten.

2018
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:24,010
Only then can their life force be transferred.

2019
02:05:24,430 --> 02:05:30,010
You mean the victims of these skeleton murders were practically eaten alive by cannibals.

2020
02:05:30,210 --> 02:05:31,590
by druids.

2021
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:32,730
By druids!

2022
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:33,750
I don't believe it.

2023
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:35,830
The worst is yet to come, Mr. Halligan.

2024
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:36,330
What?

2025
02:05:36,970 --> 02:05:38,850
What could possibly be worse than that?

2026
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:45,170
If such skeletons have been found in London, bearing marks of a golden sickle, it can only mean one thing.

2027
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:45,550
What?

2028
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:49,270
The inheritors are preparing for the perfection of their final ritual.

2029
02:05:49,530 --> 02:05:50,150
Which means?

2030
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:56,810
The myth says, once the ritual has been completed, the world will become a place governed by evil.

2031
02:05:56,890 --> 02:05:57,430
We can't have that!

2032
02:05:57,450 --> 02:06:04,610
Our magic will be unleashed upon the world, will have but one choice, to obey or to die.

2033
02:06:04,670 --> 02:06:05,190
You're great.

2034
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:07,530
And you really believe all that?

2035
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:08,690
I believe it's possible.

2036
02:06:09,010 --> 02:06:19,770
You know, Mr. Halligan, I'm not a superstitious man, but I've spent enough time studying Druidism to know that more goes on between heaven and earth than we can possibly imagine.

2037
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:21,010
I quite agree.

2038
02:06:21,290 --> 02:06:32,210
You see, and the skeletons that have been found within the past few months fit in perfectly with the Druid's sacrificial rites, is drawing near.

2039
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:33,730
Of that, I'm certain.

2040
02:06:34,150 --> 02:06:36,910
What we're looking at right now is just the beginning.

2041
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:39,910
Before we're through, more people will die.

2042
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:42,550
And the inheritors will soon be strong enough.

2043
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:43,830
What can we do about it?

2044
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:45,790
Time is running out, Mr. Halligan.

2045
02:06:46,570 --> 02:06:49,670
You must find the inheritors and put them out of action.

2046
02:06:51,130 --> 02:06:52,510
How can I do that?

2047
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:54,650
That's an easy thing to say, but how can I?

2048
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:56,130
There may be a way.

2049
02:06:56,450 --> 02:07:00,450
During my latest research, I came across something very interesting.

2050
02:07:00,690 --> 02:07:07,930
If the story I've heard is true, then there's a certain item that was extremely important for the ritual a thousand years ago.

2051
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:08,430
What is it?

2052
02:07:08,570 --> 02:07:11,530
A piece of jewelry mentioned in the old inscriptions.

2053
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:14,210
The amulet of transformation.

2054
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:16,910
You should try to gain possession of that amulet.

2055
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:18,570
The amulet of transformation?

2056
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:20,630
What's its purpose?

2057
02:07:20,950 --> 02:07:21,910
I don't know, Mr. Heligan.

2058
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:23,190
Nobody does.

2059
02:07:23,410 --> 02:07:27,790
All I do know is that the myth says it's important for the completion of the ritual.

2060
02:07:28,030 --> 02:07:32,230
If you find the amulet, you may be able to prevent the ritual.

2061
02:07:32,630 --> 02:07:34,850
Okay, I'll bury it in my backyard.

2062
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,850
Okay, perfect.

2063
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:37,730
Oh, how did you find out?

2064
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:39,310
How did you find out about the amulet?

2065
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:44,070
My work led to the discovery of a connection between the Druids of Gaul and Britain.

2066
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:49,650
It seems there was a small group of British Druids who fled to France when the ritual failed.

2067
02:07:49,670 --> 02:07:50,310
What for?

2068
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:51,130
I don't know.

2069
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:53,450
Maybe they wanted to save the amulet.

2070
02:07:53,850 --> 02:08:00,090
I found out that a 13th-century despotic French nobleman somehow gained possession of the amulet.

2071
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:02,790
I found a picture of him in an old archive.

2072
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:03,190
Really?

2073
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:04,150
Let me see.

2074
02:08:04,270 --> 02:08:04,570
Yes.

2075
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:05,050
Oh.

2076
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:29,720
I thought we were going to get, like, I don't know, a picture of, like, some archaeologist like, black and white photo.

2077
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:33,700
Oh.

2078
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:36,160
Oh, I see.

2079
02:08:36,740 --> 02:08:38,720
Well, he doesn't look particularly friendly.

2080
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:39,680
Was he a druid?

2081
02:08:39,920 --> 02:09:26,940
Well, he must have had some to the music but i really can't tell you how he gained possession of the amulet however he is the only clue that i can possibly give you as to the whereabouts of the amulet i suggest that you make your way to carmore carmore you may find more clues leading to the amulet there thank you mr blake all right mr blake i'll get going immediately i'm so sorry take care of yourself mr Halligan good luck thank you well what can I do for you you can ask me anything you want oh this is the only God had again don't do it he's the only one that's been nice to us being

2082
02:09:30,610 --> 02:09:34,910
so personal tell me mr.

2083
02:09:34,970 --> 02:09:40,730
Blake why are you in a wheelchair oh a few years back.

2084
02:09:41,310 --> 02:09:41,710
Attacked?

2085
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:42,190
Who by?

2086
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:42,870
I don't know.

2087
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:43,250
Who by?

2088
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:46,370
It was after an autograph session for my first book about the Druids.

2089
02:09:46,910 --> 02:09:49,730
A group of men were lying in wait for me and beat me up.

2090
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:50,430
No way!

2091
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:52,010
Had you had a disagreement with someone?

2092
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:53,930
No, not that I know of.

2093
02:09:54,070 --> 02:09:55,050
They just beat me up.

2094
02:09:55,650 --> 02:09:58,430
Without warning, and without saying a single word.

2095
02:09:58,650 --> 02:09:59,870
Then they left me lying there.

2096
02:10:00,070 --> 02:10:00,930
Calm as anything.

2097
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:02,170
They just strolled away.

2098
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:03,170
That's terrible.

2099
02:10:03,610 --> 02:10:04,430
Who could they have been?

2100
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:06,110
Do you know what they looked like?

2101
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:09,610
They were dressed all in black and wearing dark sunglasses.

2102
02:10:09,730 --> 02:10:10,850
That's all I remember.

2103
02:10:11,650 --> 02:10:12,650
It all happened so fast.

2104
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:14,590
And you've been in a wheelchair ever since.

2105
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:15,190
Yes.

2106
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:19,010
I can't drive anymore, and I find my work very strenuous.

2107
02:10:19,430 --> 02:10:21,770
I'll be grateful if I ever manage to finish my new book.

2108
02:10:22,050 --> 02:10:22,370
No!

2109
02:10:23,370 --> 02:10:23,890
Oh

2110
02:10:27,270 --> 02:10:28,690
my god, the four elements.

2111
02:10:28,830 --> 02:10:30,950
Wait, did he mention something like that?

2112
02:10:31,190 --> 02:10:33,150
I'd like to know more about the four elements.

2113
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:38,570
The Druids regarded the four elements as the material of which the world is made.

2114
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:42,430
They invoked the elements and used them for their rituals.

2115
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:46,430
And the magazine posted his address.

2116
02:10:46,610 --> 02:10:46,770
And Earth.

2117
02:10:47,910 --> 02:10:54,010
The fourth element existed solely for the purpose of transferring one of the three basic elements into another.

2118
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:54,850
What do you mean?

2119
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:59,430
Well, solids or liquids become gaseous through fire.

2120
02:10:59,890 --> 02:11:02,970
Gas can be turned into liquid form with the help of fire.

2121
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:06,650
Take a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, for example.

2122
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:07,790
Say solidus.

2123
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:08,290
I dare you.

2124
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:09,890
Fire therefore represents transformation.

2125
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:13,090
The transferal of one element into a new condition.

2126
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:14,890
That sounds pretty complicated.

2127
02:11:15,190 --> 02:11:16,790
I suppose it does when you first hear it.

2128
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,710
Not organization 13.

2129
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:19,010
But it's actually quite simple.

2130
02:11:19,390 --> 02:11:22,450
Yes, well, that's what my colleague Chris Hecker always tries to tell me.

2131
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:24,990
Whenever he starts lecturing me about chemistry.

2132
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:26,310
Quite right, Mr. Halligan.

2133
02:11:26,450 --> 02:11:26,710
Yes.

2134
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:28,550
I shouldn't bore you with such details.

2135
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:30,730
No solidus here.

2136
02:11:30,910 --> 02:11:31,370
Okay, that's it.

2137
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:32,070
Thank you, Mr. Blake.

2138
02:11:32,290 --> 02:11:33,170
That's all for now.

2139
02:11:33,370 --> 02:11:34,250
You're welcome, Mr. Halligan.

2140
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:37,010
No, he did the little arm thing so cute.

2141
02:11:37,290 --> 02:11:37,850
Okay, goodbye.

2142
02:11:38,730 --> 02:11:40,650
I don't know why the music stopped in here.

2143
02:11:44,010 --> 02:11:44,570
Okay.

2144
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:48,390
Okay.

2145
02:11:48,390 --> 02:11:48,810
Let's go.

2146
02:11:49,030 --> 02:11:49,670
Save reminder.

2147
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:50,870
Thank you.

2148
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:56,320
Minito 2.

2149
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:56,920
All right.

2150
02:11:57,160 --> 02:11:58,280
Resume game.

2151
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:00,440
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

2152
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,120
Can we just like look in his windows?

2153
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:02,620
Wait.

2154
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:03,860
Not much to see.

2155
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:05,260
I hope he's in.

2156
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,260
Not much to see.

2157
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:15,140
I hope he's in.

2158
02:12:15,980 --> 02:12:20,660

2160
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:51,200
It's important, but you're about to go to France.

2161
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:53,940
Do not leave Portsmouth when you get there without getting the salt.

2162
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:57,280
Exiting Portsmouth without salt will softlock you.

2163
02:12:57,540 --> 02:12:58,240
Thank you!

2164
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:03,340
Thank you, thank you.

2165
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:09,930
Hello, Captain.

2166
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:11,410
Bonjour.

2167
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:12,990
Bonjour, bonjour.

2169
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:16,890
When are you leaving for Portsmouth?

2170
02:13:17,130 --> 02:13:17,750
In two hours.

2171
02:13:18,330 --> 02:13:18,930
Are you coming?

2172
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:21,730
I'll stay here for a bit.

2173
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:23,390
No, I think I'll stay here for a bit.

2174
02:13:23,630 --> 02:13:24,130
Very well.

2175
02:13:25,390 --> 02:13:29,770
We are in France, oh my god.

2176
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:34,810
Save, I just did, we're fine.

2177
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:38,650
Writes a book about druids, gets beaten up by men black.

02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:40,890
Ah, bonjour.

Good day to you, monsieur.

2180
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:44,070
Shush, shush, shush, silence.

2181
02:13:45,610 --> 02:13:47,630

We're fine But I was gonna clarify I'm not in Portsmouth yet, so I have to get there and to get the salt Stay at the docks until you get the salt.

2187
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:11,010
Okay, that's all I needed to know.

2188
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:18,810
Okay Okay, we're gonna get salt baby You have to do everything here.

2189
02:14:18,970 --> 02:14:19,110
Okay.

2190
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:19,570
Okay.

2191
02:14:19,790 --> 02:14:20,190
Okay.

2192
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:23,230
Tell me my good man, which way is the castle castle?

2193
02:14:24,410 --> 02:15:25,050
Oh burnt down mound of rubble on the outskirts of the village I suppose yes that's it what do you want to go there for there's nothing to see there I just want to take a look around water graphics are kind of great actually that's simple just follow the road through the village past the crossroads and straight ahead keep going for about three kilometers then you can't miss it have you heard so the castle burnt down the castle burnt down did it yes that's right I think it happened in some war or other one during the Inquisition but that was hundreds of years ago have you heard of the Lord have you ever heard of the Lord of the castle of Carmore yes of course my parents used to tell me about him in order to scare me when I wouldn't go to bed for the children of Carmore the Lord was a kind of a bogeyman a bogeyman our parents used to tell us horror stories about him what did they say that villages used to vanish that the Lord would catch and kill little children they told me Pierre sleep

2194
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:27,770
now or the Lord will come and get you.

2195
02:15:27,970 --> 02:15:30,230
I remember it as if it had been yesterday.

2196
02:15:30,590 --> 02:15:32,190
The bow game, oh my goodness.

2197
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:35,310
Have you ever visited the castle as an adult?

2198
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,250
Have you ever been to the castle as an adult?

2199
02:15:37,750 --> 02:15:38,730
Yes, a couple of times.

2200
02:15:39,010 --> 02:15:40,290
The music is so loud.

2201
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:41,090
I need a stone for our new stable.

2202
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:45,030
But I don't mind telling you, I wasn't too happy out there.

2203
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:47,050
Hold on, before, let's do this.

2204
02:15:47,950 --> 02:15:49,470
I don't wanna turn the music down.

2205
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:52,430
We can turn the voices up a little bit.

2206
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:54,490
And the music down just a little bit.

2207
02:15:55,570 --> 02:15:56,010
Okay.

2208
02:15:58,030 --> 02:15:58,990
It's me again.

2209
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:01,630
My God, haven't you been listening?

2210
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:03,930
I'm trying to catch fish, my friend.

2211
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:04,410
Oh yes.

2212
02:16:04,610 --> 02:16:05,150
I'm sorry.

2213
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:07,010
Well, how do you like the area?

2214
02:16:07,310 --> 02:16:08,190
Have you explored it yet?

2215
02:16:08,350 --> 02:16:09,870
Not really, to be honest.

2216
02:16:10,130 --> 02:16:10,330
Aha.

2217
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:12,690
Then what are you doing here again?

2218
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:14,470
Trying to scare the fish away, hmm?

2219
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,090
No, no.

2220
02:16:15,370 --> 02:16:17,710
There were just a few points I wanted to clear up.

2221
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:18,590
Very well.

2222
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:21,010
But keep your voice down, will you?

2223
02:16:21,170 --> 02:16:21,570
Certainly.

2224
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:23,210
I can catch a good fish.

2225
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:24,710
Um...

2226
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:25,250
Oh, wait.

2227
02:16:25,390 --> 02:16:27,010
I have to ask about the castle again.

2228
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:28,650
No, we're fine.

2229
02:16:29,730 --> 02:16:31,270
Alright, we gotta get salt apparently.

2230
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:33,770
Salt in this thing.

2231
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:37,130
I take it these drums contain fuel.

2232
02:16:43,730 --> 02:16:44,330
Uh...

2233
02:16:57,420 --> 02:16:58,920
How do I get salt?

2234
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:04,940
We're fine, everybody, we're fine!

2235
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:47,640

2237
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:15,900

2238
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:16,700
I'm sorry.

2239
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:18,420
Well, how do you like the area?

2240
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:19,620
Have you explored it yet?

2241
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:21,300
Not really, to be honest.

2242
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:21,720
Aha.

2243
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:24,120
Then what are you doing here again?

2244
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:25,900
Trying to scare the fish away, hmm?

2245
02:18:26,120 --> 02:18:26,520
No, no.

2246
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:29,120
There were just a few points I wanted to clear up.

2247
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:30,000
Very well.

2248
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,420
But keep your voice down, will you?

2249
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:32,960
Certainly.

2250
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:33,820
Certainly.

2251
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:35,680
Which?

2252
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:36,940
Do I ask about the castle?

2253
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:39,140
Tell me, my good man, which way is the castle?

2254
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:39,680
Castle?

2255
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:44,780
Oh, you mean the burnt-down mound of rubble on the outskirts of the village, I suppose.

2256
02:18:45,300 --> 02:19:16,020
that's it what do you want to go there for there's nothing to see there i just want to take a look around so which way do i go oh that's simple just follow the road through the village past the crossroads and straight ahead keep going for about three kilometers then you can't miss it kilometers um what do you think about wait yeah got any salt do you know about the castle what do you know about salt not much it's supposed I need salt!

2257
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,980
Why is it...

2258
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:18,640
How is...

2259
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,560
Wait, I'm sorry, you get soft locked here?

2260
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:24,300
When they don't tell you literally anything about salt?

2261
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:25,040
Why is that?

2262
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:26,380
It's in danger of collapsing.

2263
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:28,400
You could just leave and you would never know.

2264
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:29,920
Anyway, it's pretty creepy out there.

2265
02:19:30,760 --> 02:19:31,840
Especially in the cemetery.

2266
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:32,240
Salt locked.

2267
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,960
There's not much left of the castle nowadays.

2268
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:38,680
Local farmers use the ruin as a quarry when they need stones for their houses.

2269
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:40,480
There's just a few bits of rubble.

2270
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,240
And salt?

2271
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:42,720
Salt?

2272
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:47,900
Have you ever heard of the Lord of the Castle of Carmore?

2273
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:48,960
Yes, of course.

2274
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:53,620
My parents used to tell me about him in order to scare me when I wouldn't go to bed.

2275
02:19:53,660 --> 02:19:55,360
Welcome to Old School Point and Glicks.

2276
02:19:55,540 --> 02:19:58,020
The Lord was a kind of ogie man, you know.

2277
02:19:58,020 --> 02:19:58,800
About ogie man.

2278
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:01,000
Our parents used to tell us horror stories about him.

2279
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:01,860
What did they say?

2280
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:06,440
That villagers used to vanish, that the Lord would catch and kill little children.

2281
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:09,520
They told me, Pierre, sleep now.

2282
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:11,340
And the only way to get rid of him is salt.

2283
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:11,960
It's salt.

2284
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:14,200
I remember it as if it had been yesterday.

2285
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:19,100
Okay, um...

2286
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:21,600
What did people believe would happen if the Lord came to get you?

2287
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,100
What did people believe would happen if the Lord came to get you?

2288
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,140
This has to be about salt.

2289
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:26,960
You'd be killed and fed to the Lord's hounds.

2290
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:29,180
At least, that's what my parents told me.

2291
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:30,120
And he would salt you.

2292
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:32,340
That's not much of a bedtime story to tell a small boy.

2293
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:32,740
Druid.

2294
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:33,980
But it worked.

2295
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:36,100
We kept away from the castle after dark.

2296
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:36,940
Captain's name.

2297
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:37,940
Oh, thank you!

2298
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:44,900
Exhaust captain's dialogue until he mentions salt and druids.

2299
02:20:45,860 --> 02:20:51,820
expect 20 plus minutes of dialogue was

2300
02:20:55,580 --> 02:21:50,890
the Lord such an evil character oh yes so I've heard he murdered his entire family not to mention half the household he was a madman if you don't do all that you're soft look have you ever been to the castle as an adult yes a couple of times we needed stones for our new stable but I don't mind telling you I wasn't too happy out there so the castle burnt down did it yes that's right I think it happened in some war or other all right this is exhausting all of his dialogue hundreds of years ago okay good luck I have to go good luck with your fishing thank you thank you I didn't get the captain's name did I sir please talk to me hello captain mm-hmm don't you do you

2302
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:24,980
to be honest.

2303
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:25,500
Uh-huh.

2304
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,820
Then what are you doing here again?

2305
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:29,580
Trying to scare the fish away, hmm?

2306
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:30,240
No, no.

2307
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,860
There were just a few points I wanted to clear up.

2308
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:33,680
Very well.

2309
02:22:34,360 --> 02:22:36,100
But keep your voice down, will you?

2310
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:36,660
Certainly.

2311
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:40,280
I don't want to go through all this dialogue again.

2312
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:43,120
Can I do anything with the fish?

2313
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:45,240
The can?

2314
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:52,600
You are a Metal Gear player.

2315
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:54,380
20 minutes of dialogue is easy peasy.

2316
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,960
I take it these drums contain fuel.

2317
02:22:58,460 --> 02:22:58,940
Oh,

2318
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:03,770
what was this?

2319
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:05,030
That's so good.

2320
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:05,850
AHHHH!

2321
02:23:13,970 --> 02:23:14,710
That's so good.

2322
02:23:16,010 --> 02:23:16,710
That's so good.

2323
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:18,370
That's so good.

2324
02:23:18,610 --> 02:23:19,150
That's so good.

2325
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:21,250
That's so good.

2326
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:22,030
That's so good.

2327
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:22,790
That's so good.

2328
02:23:23,010 --> 02:23:23,670
That's so good.

2329
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:24,530
That's so good.

2330
02:23:24,530 --> 02:23:25,190
That's so good.

2331
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:27,510
That's so good.

2332
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:27,990
That's so good.

2333
02:23:27,990 --> 02:23:28,510
That's so good.

2334
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:29,250
That's so good.

2335
02:23:29,730 --> 02:23:29,950
That's so good.

2336
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:30,730
That's so good.

2337
02:23:33,770 --> 02:23:34,530
That's salt.

2338
02:23:36,130 --> 02:23:36,570
Take it!

2339
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:37,410
Take it!

2340
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:38,190
Take it!

2341
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:39,190
What is the salt for?

2342
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:39,510
Hello, Captain.

2343
02:23:39,890 --> 02:23:41,210
What is the salt?

2344
02:23:41,410 --> 02:23:42,430
What is the salt for?

2345
02:23:43,910 --> 02:23:44,830
How are you?

2346
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:45,630
Oh.

2347
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:46,850
All right.

2348
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:47,410
Oh, wait.

2349
02:23:48,730 --> 02:23:49,190
That's...

2350
02:23:51,210 --> 02:23:53,030
I think that's all I can do.

2351
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:53,310
Okay.

2352
02:23:54,590 --> 02:23:55,370
That's salt.

2353
02:23:57,250 --> 02:23:57,710
That's salt.

2354
02:23:57,730 --> 02:23:58,370
It's me again.

2355
02:23:58,610 --> 02:23:58,810
Quiet.

2356
02:23:59,170 --> 02:24:01,090
My God, haven't you been listening?

2357
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:03,350
I'm trying to catch fish, my friend.

2358
02:24:03,530 --> 02:24:03,990
Oh, yes.

2359
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:04,730
I'm sorry.

2360
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:53,930
how do you like the area oh my god this whole dialogue really to be honest then what are you doing here again trying to scare the fish away no no there were just a few points I wanted to clear up very well I did all the talking but keep your voice down will you certainly that's salt okay what about salt tell me my good man which way is the castle castle I don't think there's a way to skip dialogue you mean the burnt-down mound of rubble on the outskirts of the there's nothing to see there i just want to take a look around so which way do i go oh that's simple just follow the road through the village past the crossroads and straight ahead keep going for about three kilometers then you can't miss it oh i've done all of these ah

2361
02:24:57,220 --> 02:25:38,000
that's so what do you know about the castle ah not much it's supposed have belonged to a rich family around here many centuries ago as a child i used to play in the ruins with my friends but it's not really safe to go walking around in the rubble why is that it's in danger wait i think this one's new anyway it's pretty creepy out there especially in the cemetery there's not much left of the castle nowadays local farmers use the ruin as a quarry when they need stones for their houses there's just a few bits of rubble left that's all yeah so Castle Burdown.

2362
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:43,200
Have you ever heard of the Lord of the Castle of Carmore?

2363
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:44,260
Yes, of course.

2364
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:48,820
My parents used to tell me about him in order to scare me when I wouldn't go to...

2365
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:49,240
Cemetery have solved!

2366
02:25:49,380 --> 02:25:53,160
For the children of Carmore, the Lord was a kind of bogeyman, you know.

2367
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:54,200
This guy talked so much.

2368
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:56,300
Our parents used to tell us horror stories about him.

2369
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:57,180
What did they say?

2370
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:59,080
That villages used to vanish.

2371
02:25:59,660 --> 02:26:01,780
That the Lord would catch and kill little children.

2372
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:04,880
They told me, Pierre, sleep now.

2373
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:05,680
Or the Lord...

2374
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:07,160
Lord will come and get you.

2375
02:26:07,380 --> 02:26:09,660
I remember it as if it had been yesterday.

2376
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
So the castle burnt down, did it?

2377
02:26:19,260 --> 02:26:20,240
Yes, that's right.

2378
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:23,800
Oh, I can skip dialogue!

2379
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:25,200
Oh my gosh!

2380
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:27,340
Have you ever been to the castle as an adult?

2381
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,820
Yes, a couple of times.

2382
02:26:29,360 --> 02:26:31,160
We needed stones for our new stable.

2383
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,000
Did I hear this one?

2384
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,060
I don't mind telling you.

2385
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:35,060
I wasn't too happy out there.

Hello, Captain.

2389
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:42,480
Bonjour.

2390
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:43,120
Bonjour.

2391
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,340
Do you know the castle?

2392
02:28:46,380 --> 02:28:47,040
Do you know the castle of Carmore?

2393
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:47,820
I say.

2394
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:48,540
I might.

2395
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:51,320
Do you know?

2396
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:53,260
Well, do you know the castle or don't you?

2397
02:28:53,580 --> 02:28:53,980
Hmm.

2398
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:54,900
Hmm.

2399
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:56,680
You're not being very talkative.

2400
02:28:56,940 --> 02:28:58,140
You're not being very talkative.

2401
02:28:58,380 --> 02:28:58,780
No.

2402
02:28:59,220 --> 02:28:59,720
No.

2403
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:03,540
Oh, well, thanks for the conversation.

2404
02:29:03,820 --> 02:29:04,320
You're welcome.

2405
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:10,300
I'm looking it up.

2406
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:12,180
I'm looking it up.

2407
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:57,340
it up mystery of the Jewish walkthrough I have no idea come on okay quick guide let's see what we have here um okay okay go to Portsmouth go to the other country wait, go to the other country on the ferry in the new map speak to the fishermen and then captain then the fisherman exhaust the dialogue until a cat appears in the zone

2408
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:07,580
get Brent Brent Halligan's model to stand near the barrel in the bottom right did we see a cat

2409
02:30:12,130 --> 02:30:20,130
did we see a cat anywhere did we see a cat anywhere When the cat comes out and walks between the lampposts and the crate.

2410
02:30:22,090 --> 02:30:23,890
Use the green scarf on the cat.

2411
02:30:24,670 --> 02:30:25,110
What?

2412
02:30:26,650 --> 02:30:29,030
I talked to them so many times, though.

2413
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:31,670
Make a third save and check the castle.

2414
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:33,130
The key.

2415
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:42,690
Check the castle.

2416
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:43,350
Talk to Pierre.

2417
02:30:43,950 --> 02:30:47,070
The issues with the salt arc is that no one knows how the castle can softlock you.

2418
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:50,430
But again, what the hell is this game?

2419
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:53,290
A descheville.

2420
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:55,830
What?

2421
02:30:57,170 --> 02:30:57,910
It says it's...

2422
02:30:57,910 --> 02:30:58,510
A deschevaux.

2423
02:30:58,730 --> 02:30:58,890
Okay.

2424
02:30:59,150 --> 02:31:00,510
Probably the fishermen's.

2425
02:31:01,870 --> 02:31:03,990
I thought Lowry was the car guy.

2426
02:31:04,310 --> 02:31:05,250
Okay, so we go here.

2427
02:31:05,750 --> 02:31:06,210
All right, wait.

2428
02:31:08,370 --> 02:31:08,850
We...

2429
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:10,770
Cute kitten on bottom right.

2430
02:31:11,430 --> 02:31:11,910
Yeah.

2431
02:31:13,170 --> 02:31:15,290
The cat only appears after view exhaust.

2432
02:31:15,370 --> 02:31:16,850
That's what I thought I have.

2433
02:31:17,070 --> 02:31:20,470
Maybe I need to go to the castle and then they say...

2434
02:31:21,790 --> 02:31:24,230
Then he says, have you explored the area?

2435
02:31:24,470 --> 02:32:00,040
like yes I don't know okay we'll just go and look around must be the castle or rather what's left of it pretty whoa do I want to go in well I saved did she get the salt no that's why we're here the ceiling of the tower has caved in and Okay, maybe I'll try going back now.

2436
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:05,200
Back?

2437
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:06,820
Hello!

2438
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,620
How do you know if you're soft-locked?

2439
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:11,220
Is the ship gone?

2440
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:15,180
Oh, we got the BGM back!

2441
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:16,480
Hello, I'm back.

2442
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:18,220
Damn, quiet, I said.

2443
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:20,080
Are you trying to frighten the fish off?

2444
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:21,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

2445
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:22,160
I forgot.

2446
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:23,660
I was miles away.

2447
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:24,180
Oh, here we go.

2448
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:24,980
This is new.

2449
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:26,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2450
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:27,080
This is new.

2451
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:28,940
And what do you think of our little village?

2452
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:34,460
Hmm, it's nice, but I've got a few more questions regarding our last talk.

2453
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:38,680
Oh, well, go ahead and ask, but please quietly.

2454
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:39,440
Quietly.

2455
02:32:40,220 --> 02:32:40,760
Precisely, Michael.

2456
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:41,200
You don't?

2457
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:41,760
You don't know?

2458
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:43,880
You learn quickly.

2459
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:44,680
Okay.

2460
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:48,460
Um, I would like to speak to you about fishing.

2461
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:49,880
I'd like to speak to you about fishing.

2462
02:32:50,180 --> 02:32:51,260
What would you like to know?

2463
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:54,140
I discovered you recently through your karaoke changes.

2464
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:57,080
I just wanted to drop one and say I have one of the best voice and cutest bottle.

2465
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:59,280
thank you thanks for sticking around oh i like your fishing rod i like your fishing rod it's a beauty yes nice isn't it it's an enhanced fiberglass telescope ultra light 47 latest model could you give me one of your fish could you give me one of your fish on a normal day i would but i just haven't been able to catch enough today how many fish have you caught not a single one not a lot yeah precisely I must try to catch some now otherwise I will have nothing to offer this evening you're planning to sell the fish no no I have visitors coming this evening you understand I see I suppose there's nothing doing then sorry why don't you just buy a fishing rod of your own and come and join me who knows nice and quiet you may be lucky um do you mind if I hold your fishing rod do you mind if I hold your fishing rod Sorry,

2466
02:33:59,440 --> 02:33:59,780
my friend.

2467
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:01,220
It was very expensive.

2468
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:03,340
I spent 800 francs on it.

2469
02:34:03,740 --> 02:34:05,480
And I'm not going to anyone else touch it.

2470
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:08,300
What are you planning to catch?

2471
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:09,520
What are you planning to catch?

2472
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:13,620
Ah, you may not believe me, but I've caught all kinds of things here.

2473
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:20,300
You know, I've caught pike five meters long with eyes like plates and razor sharp teeth.

2474
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:21,820
That's why I bought this rod.

2475
02:34:22,260 --> 02:34:26,100
The last one was pulled clean out of my hands by one of those beasts.

2476
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:27,840
You expect me to believe that?

2477
02:34:27,840 --> 02:35:01,120
of course it's the truth i swear i even had some photos of one of those fish but i'm afraid i lost them they fell into the water right here and now there's not a shred of evidence to support your story that is a pity don't you believe me ask captain de nerve he will confirm it i often show him the fish that i catch we got the name captain de nerve who's that oh you don't know him he captains the ferry that brought you here he's over there on board He's experienced a lot and has been all over the place.

2478
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:01,400
Where's the cat?

2479
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:02,580
He knows a lot of stories.

2480
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:04,820
Incredible stories.

2481
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:05,240
Oh?

2482
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:06,780
Like what, for example?

2483
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,720
You'll have to ask him that yourself.

2484
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:12,700
I never really listened properly when he starts spinning his yarns.

2485
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:14,860
He's bound to tell you a story or two.

2486
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:17,660
You just have to know how to deal with him.

2487
02:35:17,860 --> 02:35:18,940
Okay, I think we...

2488
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:20,180
Okay, I'm gonna keep...

2489
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:24,140
I'm going to keep, um...

2490
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:25,560
Exhausting this.

2491
02:35:25,980 --> 02:35:27,360
Because we still need the cat.

2492
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:59,740
deal with him what do you mean not so loud please because of the fish no because of captain denerve he might hear us and look I'll tell you something denerve's a bit strange he insists on being addressed by his titles it's a how do you call it a peculiarity of his oh why is that he's an old sea dog from a real old seafaring family some ancestor of his served in Napoleon's fleet he himself Capitan!

2493
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:00,120
Capitan!

2494
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:03,540
Got a master's certificate and all that.

2495
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:05,840
Seen the world, so he says...

2496
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:08,240
These days he just captains the ferry.

2497
02:36:08,400 --> 02:36:11,100
But he still insists on people using his title.

2498
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:14,740
He says his rank should still command people's respect.

2499
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:16,900
Oh, well, if that's all, I don't mind.

2500
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:18,900
What do I have to call him then?

2501
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Monsieur Le Capitan Chaldenerve.

2502
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:22,860
That's his full title.

2503
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:24,540
He'll appreciate that.

2504
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:25,220
Got it.

2505
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:26,200
Thanks for the hint.

2506
02:36:26,300 --> 02:36:27,160
Nice, nice.

2507
02:36:28,520 --> 02:37:17,720

I have to talk to the fisherman.

2509
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:30,840
Then the captain, maybe I did then do talk to the fisherman again.

2510
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:32,460
And then the cat shows up, okay.

2511
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:33,940
Excuse me.

2512
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:34,300
What?

2513
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:39,060
You're Monsieur Le Capitain Charles de Neuve.

2514
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,980
You're Monsieur Le Capitain Charles de Neuve, aren't you?

2515
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:44,120
Yes, that is correct, my boy.

2516
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:47,820
Charles de Neuve, captain of the Merchant Navy of France.

2517
02:37:48,060 --> 02:37:49,040
How do you know my name?

2518
02:37:49,160 --> 02:37:52,380
I've been talking to a friend of yours, the fisherman over there at the jetty.

2519
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:52,880
Pierre?

2520
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:54,600
Ah, yes.

2521
02:37:55,060 --> 02:37:55,760
Old Pierre.

2522
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:58,120
I expect he has been telling you about his pike.

2523
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,360
The one that was five meters long.

2524
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:00,780
Oh, yes.

2525
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:01,420
Yes, he did.

2526
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:04,680
Uh.

2527
02:38:06,580 --> 02:38:08,020
Is his story true?

2528
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:09,960
Is his story true?

2529
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:11,540
To be honest with you, my boy.

2530
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:14,240
Pierre tends to exaggerate a little.

2531
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:14,860
No.

2532
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:15,860
Just like all fishermen.

2533
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:18,440
The pike was about four and a half meters long.

2534
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:19,040
Is he talking?

2535
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:19,780
No more than that.

2536
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:20,060
Okay.

2537
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:22,720
Okay, you're from here too.

2538
02:38:22,900 --> 02:38:25,800
Pierre says you're from Carmore like he is.

2539
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:26,520
Is that true?

2540
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:27,640
Yes, that's right.

2541
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:37,640
I grew up here as a youngster I wanted to be a fisherman and used to work on my father's trawler later I went to naval college to become a captain of the merchant Navy of France.

2542
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:47,080
I miss the I have a small house at the end of the road just behind Francoise Bistro I'm used to tell me more about Pierre.

2543
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:48,200
Tell me more about Pierre.

2544
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:54,960
I meet him almost every day the fishing industry went down the drain.

2545
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:56,320
So he's a fisherman, is he?

2546
02:38:56,480 --> 02:38:59,040
He used to have three trawlers and five employees.

2547
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:02,420
But nobody wants French fish anymore these days.

2548
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:03,800
They're too expensive.

2549
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:09,660
Now he spends his days sitting at the jetty, catching a few fish for himself and his friends to eat.

2550
02:39:09,780 --> 02:39:16,500
They meet round at his place practically every evening and talk about old times when they used to go out on their trawlers every day.

2551
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:18,620
Whether the cat shows up or not is the soft lock.

2552
02:39:18,740 --> 02:39:19,020
Yeah.

2553
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:21,980
I think that's what we're determining.

2554
02:39:24,620 --> 02:40:15,180
doesn't he have anything better to do no not much none of the villagers here has much to do since business is so bad nowadays here has a small farm which supplies him with all he needs a few years back he built himself a small stable next to his house where he keeps a few animals his life is rather boring really that's why he's always pleased when I tell him a few stories how long does he sit there fishing until I come back with my last load of passengers since he's had that fishing rod he sometimes sits there even longer oh my god I have time we go over to Francois place when I'm finished for the day he just wants friends thank you monsieur de le captain thank you monsieur le captain you've been a great help you're welcome my boy moment of truth maybe let

2555
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:24,700
me go talk to him one more time excuse me Pierre yeah Yes.

2556
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:25,420
Now what?

2557
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:31,720
I'd like to ask you something about Captain Deneuve.

2558
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:32,940
Have you spoken to him?

2559
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:34,000
Yes, I have.

2560
02:40:34,640 --> 02:40:35,320
And you were right.

2561
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:36,460
He's a very strange man.

2562
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:38,580
I think it says that you have to talk to him one more time.

2563
02:40:40,820 --> 02:40:41,940
And then we...

2564
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:44,300
Can you really believe everything he says?

2565
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:46,760
Well, I'm not sure quite honestly.

2566
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:49,840
He's a sailor, and they're always full of stories.

2567
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:51,340
Fishermen are full of stories.

2568
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:52,800
Sailors are full of stories.

2569
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:55,120
Enough time to experience a great deal.

2570
02:40:56,260 --> 02:41:58,620
things to become a bit muddled up in one's mind he certainly seems to say some strange things i don't think all his stories are true but there's a core of truth in many of them you'll have to make up your own mind which of his stories to believe he didn't sound so far-fetched like is he your friend is he a friend of yours friend well i've seen him almost every day for a number of years he captains the ferry i do my fishing when he's finished for the day we sometimes go over to the should mention that he has a cat yes now I come to think of it I suppose we are friends and you get on well with each other I should think it's pretty difficult being friends with a man like him oh we get on rather well really we don't talk much you know if anything he does the talking spins his yarns the only thing about him that sometimes drives me crazy is his damned cat the captain has a cat yes he lets her out here on the jetty in the morning and takes her back in at night and the damned beast spends all

2571
02:41:58,620 --> 02:42:57,360
day slinking around here you don't like cats i hate cats please they steal the fish from my bucket or get tangled up in my fishing line the nerves creature has often knocked my bucket of bait over and i've had to go and get some more i've told him hundreds of times to take the animal on the ferry with him but he just won't mention okay um i'm gonna still exhaust the dialogue since this part why does he only captain a small nowadays yeah he used to command a large merchant ship but then he was dismissed I I think it was because he drank he missed Cape Town Harbor in the fog that could have happened to anyone drink or no drink yes but it so happens that with him it was drink it was actually seeing double in the fog he saw the shadowy outlines of two bays and ordered his helmsman to set course for the one on the right and that was the wrong one exactly there was no right The port had one bay,

2572
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:58,240
not two.

2573
02:42:58,540 --> 02:43:00,360
But you'd better keep that to yourself.

2574
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:02,900
He gets pretty embarrassed if anyone mentions it.

2575
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:03,600
You're just gossiping.

2576
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,160
I understand.

2577
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:04,940
Jeez, okay.

2578
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:07,820
Okay.

2579
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:09,880
Thank you for your assistance.

2580
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:11,900
Thank you for your assistance.

2581
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:13,020
Thank you for the secret.

2582
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:13,700
You're welcome.

2583
02:43:15,880 --> 02:43:17,200
Thank kitty for good luck.

2584
02:43:21,510 --> 02:43:21,890
Okay.

2585
02:43:22,570 --> 02:43:23,850
There will be a cat here.

2586
02:43:23,930 --> 02:43:24,390
Wait, hold on.

2587
02:43:24,450 --> 02:43:26,210
Let me see how it says to do the cat.

2588
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:33,650
When the cat comes out, walk between the lamppost and the crate, use the green scarf.

2589
02:43:34,830 --> 02:43:35,610
Okay, here we go.

2590
02:43:35,830 --> 02:43:36,170
Let's hope.

2591
02:43:37,450 --> 02:43:37,970
Oh!

2592
02:43:39,490 --> 02:43:39,770
Oh.

2593
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:41,130
Wait.

2594
02:43:41,570 --> 02:43:42,910
I think I needed to get him.

2595
02:43:44,630 --> 02:43:45,010
Wait.

2596
02:43:46,330 --> 02:43:47,410
Does he come back out?

2597
02:43:51,310 --> 02:43:51,830
Is...

2598
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:54,350
Does he come back out?

2599
02:43:56,130 --> 02:43:56,990
Have to wait?

2600
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:01,720
I'll wait.

2601
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:04,200
This is kind of nice.

2602
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:06,480
It's waiting time.

2603
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:12,080
Alright.

2604
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:14,420
We're waiting.

2605
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:17,320
It's a waiting puzzle.

2606
02:44:18,080 --> 02:44:20,500
Cats just do what they want to do.

2607
02:44:22,020 --> 02:44:22,520
You know?

2608
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,880
Wait for him with the scarf ready.

2609
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:28,600
The minute intervals.

2610
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:29,680
Well guys, we'll...

2611
02:44:29,700 --> 02:44:31,700
Welcome to today's...

2612
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:33,440
Zatsudan.

2613
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:34,780
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2614
02:44:39,700 --> 02:44:41,660
This is a game?

2615
02:44:42,520 --> 02:44:42,940
Yeah.

2616
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:48,000
Um...

2617
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,460
What if I went back over there and then... Here, I'll save and find out.

2618
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:54,260
Hold on.

2619
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:57,360
Save.

2620
02:44:58,040 --> 02:44:59,140
Binto 4.

2621
02:45:02,720 --> 02:45:03,280
Resume.

2622
02:45:09,560 --> 02:45:12,600
If I move too quickly, I'll scare the cat away.

2623
02:45:14,780 --> 02:45:16,140
Okay, I do have to wait.

2624
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:18,280
Wait, it says wait where.

2625
02:45:19,380 --> 02:45:19,740
Wait.

2626
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:21,300
There's no way I can be ready.

2627
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:22,700
The cat just walks away.

2628
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:32,120
To stand near the barrel in the bottom right of the screen.

2629
02:45:36,410 --> 02:45:45,670
This is not, this, like here, when the cat comes out, walk between the lamppost and the crate.

2630
02:45:47,310 --> 02:45:51,570
Okay, so maybe, maybe down here.

2631
02:45:54,330 --> 02:45:55,770
Maybe I'm standing too close.

2632
02:45:55,930 --> 02:45:57,490
Okay, this might be good.

2633
02:45:57,570 --> 02:46:03,970
And then I have to walk to where the cat, go.

2634
02:46:06,270 --> 02:46:07,910
A stealth section?

2635
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:10,430
Okay.

2636
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:12,430
Alright, this seems...

2637
02:46:12,430 --> 02:46:12,670
Oh!

2638
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:13,850
There's the cat.

2639
02:46:14,190 --> 02:46:14,290
Okay.

2640
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:15,030
Okay.

2641
02:46:15,690 --> 02:46:15,830
Okay.

2642
02:46:17,730 --> 02:46:18,950
Where'd the cat go?

2643
02:46:26,170 --> 02:46:26,450
Oh!

2644
02:46:27,530 --> 02:46:28,810
First try!

2645
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:32,810
Oh my god, we just catnapped him.

2646
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:38,160
Ooh, nice!

2647
02:46:38,460 --> 02:46:39,340
We gained?

2648
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:40,140
Okay.

2649
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:43,780
So then now I go to the cat.

2650
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:44,560

What was the first one, though?

2658
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:52,420
Thus, Halian steals a fishing rod, so he no longer needs...

2659
02:49:52,420 --> 02:49:54,960
He no longer needs for a handful of soul.

2660
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,060
Yeah, wait!

2661
02:49:56,780 --> 02:49:58,020

You good?

2663
02:49:59,080 --> 02:50:00,600
You dodge the most egregious one.

2664
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:01,640
That's so funny.

2665
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:04,240
I can't believe this...

2666
02:50:04,240 --> 02:50:10,260
I can't wait to watch the videos about this game after everything so that I can...

2667
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:12,120
I can't believe... We did it.

2668
02:50:12,160 --> 02:50:15,860
We dodged it very, very smoothly, I'd say.

2669
02:50:16,680 --> 02:50:17,280
Thanks for the stream.

2670
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:18,200

Good morning, Ryder.

2678
02:50:31,060 --> 02:50:34,780
Isn't it so funny that they say good morning, good morning, Minto?

2679
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:37,780
I mean, good morning, Ryder, and I say good morning, Minto every day.
