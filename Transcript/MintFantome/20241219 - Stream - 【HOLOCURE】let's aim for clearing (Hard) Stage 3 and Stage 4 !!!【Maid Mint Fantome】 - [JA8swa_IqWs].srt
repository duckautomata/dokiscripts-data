1
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:17,770
Yay!

2
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,210
If

3
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,320
you can read this...

4
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,260
I could.

5
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
What does that mean?

6
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,160
What does that mean?

7
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,520
Hello, bababoy.

8
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,860
That's what it means.

9
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,420
I'm back.

10
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,280
Welcome back!

11
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
Hello, hello, hello.

12
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
Everybody, welcome.

13
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,900
It's too late.

14
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,280
It is way... It's late.

15
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,760
It's too late for me, guys.

16
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,080
I love Holocure.

17
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,780
Did you find your try of time?

18
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
Try of time.

19
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,360
If you can read this, you're capable of reading.

20
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,100
I mean...

21
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,680
Hey, wisp sitting next to me.

22
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Read that for me.

23
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,860
Oh, I understand now.

24
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,360
Thank you.

25
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,080
Can you minto cure me with minto beam?

26
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
You're sick?

27
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
No, Kevin!

28
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,580
Don't be sick.

29
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,660
Minto, minto, beam!

30
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,740
The Holocure addiction is terminal.

31
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,680
Yeah, it kind of is.

32
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,580
How is Butaro?

33
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,160
Have you made him and Pies a love box yet?

34
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,400
Got an S rank.

35
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,820
I'm so sad.

36
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
I thought they would be really good friends.

37
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,540
It's been the most pathetic thing.

38
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,620
So, Butaro is good.

39
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,500
He's been recovering well.

40
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,260
He's been a little drowsy because of the pain medicine from his surgery.

41
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,620
But, I got good news today.

42
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,540
From the vet, they called me.

43
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,180
And they were like...

44
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,680
We wanted to let you know that we got the...

45
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,980
They did a biopsy of the mass that was on his leg.

46
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,860
And they were worried that maybe it was a cancerous thing.

47
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,260
That it also spread to other parts of his little body.

48
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,020
But, they said that no.

49
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,260
It was just completely located just in that one location.

50
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,900
So, it should never grow back.

51
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,320
And this should be...

52
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,780
They should have taken care of it.

53
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,180
Yeah, they were like...

54
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,160
If it's something else...

55
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,180
They were telling me...

56
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,460
Some people go through radiation.

57
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,100
Some people go through surgery every time it grows back.

58
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,280
Some people even get their pet's leg amputated.

59
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,860
But, for my little guy, he didn't need any of that.

60
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,000
They were like...

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,440
It was just all right in that area.

62
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,240
He's a tough cookie, my little guy.

63
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,360
He's so sweet.

64
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,140
Well, not really recently.

65
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,880
He's been in the little donut cone for like two months now.

66
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,620
Poor guy.

67
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,820
He hasn't slept normally in so long.

68
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,000
And he's just been really drowsy from the medicine.

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,660
He actually has been a bad boy.

70
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,520
But that's okay.

71
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,260
I still love him.

72
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,440
He's excusably pissy.

73
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,340
Yeah, exactly.

74
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,400
But the saddest thing is, he tries to go to pause.

75
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,520
Because he's just like...

76
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
Please, I can't lick myself.

77
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,460
Please, just lick me.

78
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,360
Please, lick me.

79
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,700
Please, lick me.

80
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,240
Please.

81
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,640
Also, please don't clip that out of context.

82
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,250
He's just like me.

83
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,320
What did I walk into?

84
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,920
What?

85
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,170
He'll like go up to pause and just be like my cat.

86
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,930
And be like, please lick me.

87
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,330
I'm so dirty.

88
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,110
I just want to be clean.

89
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,970
And she'll like look at him and sniff him and then walk away.

90
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,790
And it's just so sad.

91
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,590
I'm like...

92
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,690
He gets rejected every time.

93
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,390
And I thought they would be best buddies by now.

94
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,330
But they never get into like a cat...

95
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,090
They never cuddle or anything.

96
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,450
They never hang out.

97
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,390
They just...

98
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,250
Closes out clipping from real life.

99
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:19,870
What?

100
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,490
Thanks for the new ringtone.

101
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,830
No!

102
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,370
No!

103
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,950
At least they don't fight.

104
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,910
They do, but it's like a play fight, you know?

105
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,330
Like they chase each other around.

106
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,030
They like to fight more than they like each other, I think.

107
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,370
But that's okay.

108
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,030
My silly guys.

109
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,510
Lick request denied.

110
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,230
Yeah, I didn't go through the proper lick channels.

111
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,670
He didn't file the proper lick paperwork.

112
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,750
Poor guy is a big stinker for real right now.

113
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,430
I know!

114
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,730
I feel so bad for him.

115
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,390
He does that thing where if I scratch under where his...

116
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,690
Where...

117
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,930
Like the donut.

118
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,270
If I scratch underneath that to get places that he can't reach.

119
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,430
He like does a licky.

120
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,030
And he like...

121
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,890
And sometimes he'll just sit there and just lick the donut.

122
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,050
Like he's pretending to lick himself.

123
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,510
It's so sad.

124
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,630
Under where?

125
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,330
No!

126
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,110
Under there!

127
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,930
Yeah, poor guy.

128
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,270
AI summary says Minto is the cat with the cone of shame.

129
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,030
No!

130
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,170
Not me.

131
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,750
Medic, thank you!

132
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,230
Thanks for the refunds!

133
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,990
Christmas edition.

134
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,810
Guys, I've been trying to get through achievements in Holocure.

135
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,170
Slowly but surely.

136
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,410
Because like the games are so long, right?

137
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,070
Love the concert.

138
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,070
It was my first concert I've ever been by myself.

139
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,250
Thanks for being a perfect first concert.

140
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,350
Thanks for allowing us to be your first concert!

141
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:08,750
Green!

142
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,950
Thank you!

143
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,150
Thank you.

144
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,290
Minto, Miku is coming to Fortnite next year, January.

145
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,470
And this month Mariah Carey.

146
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,070
And tomorrow is something evil that should burn.

147
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,210
What the bell is going on?

148
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,510
Wait, it's tomorrow!

149
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,670
Is tomorrow the Skibidi?

150
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,830
Are we Skibidi tomorrow?

151
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,310
Skibidi is out now.

152
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,170
Skibidi Charler?

153
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,870
Skibidi Charler?

154
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,970
Forgot to mention this the other day, but literally after the first day of the con, Minto merch already started getting sold out.

155
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,750
By the third day, almost all the Minto stuff other than prints were out.

156
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,050
Seriously?

157
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,970
They must have not brought so much stock.

158
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,430
Probably.

159
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,030
Stinky stream.

160
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,410
No!

161
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,270
Not stinky stream.

162
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,710
Can confirm, I bought most of it.

163
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,170
LOL

164
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,310
Freak Phantom is in demand.

165
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,060
Any 300k endurance streams?

166
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,740
No, I don't think so.

167
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,100
Oh gosh, that reminds me, I have to work on stuff.

168
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,620
Let me write it down.

169
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,080
Let me write on my notepad.

170
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,280
We are about 1k away.

171
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,260
From 300k.

172
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,020
Isn't that crazy?

173
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,280
Maybe I should have a little thingy up.

174
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,720
Hold on.

175
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm gonna do some promotion.

176
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
I was hoping they would sing this song at the concert.

177
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,280
But getting Parade...

178
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,430
Is still good too.

179
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:28,570
I don't know.

180
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,530
Oshispark tweets my concert pics soon.

181
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,350
Did you send them to them?

182
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,410
Work, ghost girl, work!

183
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,330
Wait, how do I find the...

184
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,070
Oh, here, hold on.

185
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,750
Wait, how do I find the...

186
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,090
The channel's subscriber count?

187
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,770
Wait, how do I find the live subscriber count?

188
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,170
Oh, is it under this?

189
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,630
Oh, I see, I got it, I got it, I got it.

190
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,890
Okay, hold on.

191
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,370
One second.

192
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,010
Now you guys can make this number go up or down.

193
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,350
That's the really funny thing.

194
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,610
We can have this number go any way we want.

195
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,830
Does that cover?

196
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,750
Okay, no.

197
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,330
Go down, go down.

198
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,850
Actually, what if I cover it?

199
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,590
You guys will know.

200
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,570
Get it to 250.

201
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
Gary, thank you so much for the pink.

202
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,620
Funny you mentioned that.

203
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,220
Yesterday, me and my friends saw the Skibidi announcement post.

204
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,020
Oh, it went down!

205
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,060
I was so doubtful that it was real, I made a bet that if it actually got added, I'd watch episodes 1 through 69 of Skibidi Toilet.

206
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,780
Surely, they can't be that long, right?

207
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,220
Surely, it can't be that long.

208
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,460
I feel.

209
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,560
I think.

210
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,780
Oh my god!

211
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,540
It's going down!

212
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,140
Most of them are like 30 seconds.

213
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,220
Yeah, I think you'll be safe.

214
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
But you'll know the lore.

215
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,580
You'll know the... Oh my god!

216
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,850
Skibidi watch along... Hey, hey, hey.

217
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,210
That's Gary.

218
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,830
That's all on Gary.

219
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,070
Don't bet if you're not... You know, we didn't bet the Minto Stonks are crashed.

220
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,690
My birthday was on Monday.

221
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,850
Starchie, happy birthday!

222
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,570
Sorry for belated.

223
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,690
Happy birthday to you.

224
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,770
Happy birthday to you.

225
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,450
Happy birthday dear Starchie.

226
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,670
Happy birthday to you.

227
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,280
Happy...

228
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,320
It's like... This is... Some people might think that this is the stock.

229
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,920
The amount we have left of stock, right?

230
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,160
But actually, it's my dignity.

231
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,380
The Skibidi follows.

232
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,180
His brain rot is cray-cray.

233
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,860
For real, for real, no cap.

234
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,920
The only thing I know about Skibidi is that...

235
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,360
They took the assets not just from Gary's mod, but also...

236
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,660
Like, the camera guy is using old Nico Nico Douga stuff.

237
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,200
I thought these stonks are supposed to be mint.

238
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,760
The mint stonks are crashing.

239
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,320
Anyway, I've been trying to get achievements completed in the game.

240
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,360
And these two.

241
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,360
Defeat the boss of stage 3, hard.

242
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,000
Defeat the boss of stage 4, parentheses, hard.

243
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,440
What does... Why is there parentheses for one and not the other?

244
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm confused.

245
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,860
Typo.

246
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,100
Kay goofed.

247
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,860
Okay.

248
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,000
Silly.

249
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,200
You'll be back.

250
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,200
You'll all be back.

251
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,580
Please come back.

252
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,140
There's some more I haven't gotten.

253
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,780
This one?

254
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,580
Oh my gosh, I've been trying forever.

255
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,240
Clear a game without moving.

256
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,920
I haven't gachikoid sauna yet, so...

257
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,900
And everybody keeps telling me to use sauna, but I kept using fauna.

258
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Because I'm stubborn, but I think I'll have to use sauna.

259
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:16,980
I'll try.

260
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,540
Use fauna.

261
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,240
I tried!

262
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,680
I tried.

263
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,920
I tried.

264
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,660
I yakkied my soul and shoulders out.

265
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,560
Oh gosh, I hope you liked our group shikishi.

266
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,120
I did!

267
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,060
Thank you!

268
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,260
Sorry for the bad handwriting.

269
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,380
Why does everybody always apologize for their handwriting?

270
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,460
This one, deal over 10,000 damage.

271
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,200
I haven't tried to get that one yet.

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,060
Because I don't really focus on big damage girlies.

273
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,560
Hardcore mode I haven't done yet.

274
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,600
Clear with your only...

275
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Oh, this one I was gonna do earlier and ran out of time.

276
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,860
I keep trying to do the fail enhancements, but...

277
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,420
I guess I'm just too lucky.

278
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,640
Did the no move with Fubuki.

279
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,220
Yeah, I can't get these.

280
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,400
I'm just too lucky.

281
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm just too lucky.

282
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,500
Let's see, what else have I not done?

283
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,440
Oh, every kind of fish.

284
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,420
Haven't done that.

285
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
Get to manager level 4.

286
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,320
I think I'm on level 3.

287
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,180
Clear hard stage without taking any damage from projectiles.

288
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,820
Congrats on releasing mint coin.

289
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,920
Watame will full send healing device items is how I got my no move clear.

290
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,840
I drove 700 miles to see the concert from Texas.

291
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,880
My first time out of my state.

292
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,660
It's also my birthday on the day of...

293
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,780
Horned Lizard!

294
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,400
Hopefully you didn't drive by yourself.

295
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,960
Oh my god.

296
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,140
Happy birthday to you.

297
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,740
Happy birthday to you.

298
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,540
Happy birthday Horned Lizard.

299
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,060
Happy birthday to you.

300
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,460
Happy birthday.

301
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,140
Oh my gosh.

302
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,820
You can still drive 700 miles and still be in Texas.

303
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,280
That's wild.

304
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,700
Have over 500 HP in one run.

305
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,860
Win a worker... Oh yeah, these are all the new ones.

306
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,360
Get a pet.

307
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,020
Get no questions wrong in stage 4.

308
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,160
Wait, what?

309
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,460
Is this the casino?

310
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Probably.

311
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,520
Probably.

312
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,040
And then the tower.

313
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,020
I haven't done the rest.

314
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,120
I haven't done the rest.

315
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,340
I can show you though.

316
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,540
Look at how many coins... Look how many...

317
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,000
Wait.

318
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,180
You have to see how many I have.

319
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,600
Look!

320
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,360
I have 14,000 Peko chips.

321
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,520
Or Usa chips.

322
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,260
14,000!

323
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,800
You guys, I won the jackpot.

324
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,400
I did.

325
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,340
I've been gambling.

326
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,840
I still don't have enough for like anything.

327
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,000
These guys are expensive.

328
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,320
But I was on the slots...

329
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,660
I was on the slots like crazy.

330
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,100
You can AFK at the slots overnight and you have massive stocks.

331
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,580
You guys...

332
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,550
I need a pet.

333
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,310
How big are these massive stocks?

334
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,550
AFK the slots is the real strat.

335
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,470
Yeah, I was just on here and I was just like...

336
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,250
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

337
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,430
See?

338
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,670
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

339
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,130
See?

340
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,010
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

341
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,830
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

342
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,790
Spin, spin, spin, spin!

343
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,010
See?

344
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,230
I think I'm really good at this game.

345
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,340
It doesn't matter how much...

346
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,500
How little I win.

347
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,140
I still won.

348
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,380
No thoughts.

349
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,380
Just gambling.

350
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,660
Favorite time!

351
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,540
Favorite...

352
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
We're killing it!

353
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm already at 15,000!

354
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm at 16,000!

355
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,160
We'll get the jackpot.

356
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
We'll get the jackpot.

357
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,420
Jackpot.

358
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,400
Jackpot, baby.

359
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,980
Jackpot!

360
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,360
The math achievement is referring to the hard version of stage 4.

361
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,580
We have to do mental math during a boss battle and get the...

362
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,210
Like in here.

363
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,830
This one.

364
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,060
No, the spoilers.

365
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Oh,

366
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
Koyuki!

367
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,780
Wasureru beam!

368
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,080
Wasureru beam!

369
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,760
Forgetty beam!

370
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,860
Forgetty spaghetti!

371
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,780
Koyuki, I'm afraid for you.

372
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,540
I'm afraid for you.

373
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,740
Maybe...

374
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,420
Don't show your face around here.

375
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,940
Just don't type in chat for a little bit, you know?

376
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,280
Everybody will jump you.

377
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,240
Who are you, Vtuber?

378
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,060
I'm Minky!

379
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,980
Koyuki did nothing wrong.

380
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,810
Don't come to chat tomorrow.

381
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,470
Jujutsu jumping!

382
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,950
Leave him alone!

383
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:29,970
It's fine!

384
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,850
It's fine!

385
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,270
Have you tried Withering Wave?

386
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,690
Same developer of Punishing Gray Raven.

387
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,850
I haven't!

388
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,870
Isn't that the game that people kept...

389
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,410
Kept nominating at the Gamer Awards?

390
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,890
Alrighty.

391
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,850
For stage 3...

392
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,970
I'm like, do you think I can go with Fauna?

393
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,030
Kiwawa.

394
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,770
Maybe Fauna.

395
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,690
I won't be able to lurk around today, but today is my birthday!

396
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,530
Could I possibly ask for a song?

397
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,010
Of course!

398
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,990
You pushed me to be my best self and I'm happy to celebrate it with Mint in the Woods!

399
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:18,890
GOGO!

400
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,630
GOGO!

401
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,550
Happy birthday to you!

402
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,450
Happy birthday to you!

403
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,610
Happy birthday dear GOGO!

404
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,710
Happy birthday to you!

405
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,810
Happy birthday!

406
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,130
That's weird, I saw a light.

407
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,010
How did I get here?

408
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,510
Welcome.

409
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,330
The concert was an unforgettable experience for me and our girlfriend.

410
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,750
I'm sure many other Wizbloons too.

411
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,950
You and Toki rocked it.

412
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,650
Can't wait for the next one.

413
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,970
Thank you, Aura Bravin!

414
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,430
Our girlfriend.

415
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,870
Let's try Fauna.

416
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:17,570
Alright.

417
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,430
Oh, MILF.

418
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,510
Man, I love Fauna.

419
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,710
I had this earlier.

420
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,790
Let's try.

421
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,670
Heal potion.

422
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,230
Yeah, actually.

423
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,190
Maybe.

424
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,370
I have a great forgetting beam.

425
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,130
Search up weathering waves.

426
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,270
I got your back, run!

427
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,690
This is a say so stream!

428
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,030
She's already a healer.

429
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,070
Yeah, but we can get the instant heal.

430
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,910
And then she'll shoot her branches.

431
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,610
Right, well this counted the branches, I wonder.

432
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,970
I could dash though.

433
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,830
But I always forget to dash.

434
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,910
I feel like if it's healing, I won't forget it.

435
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,750
Nice cover.

436
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,190
Nice cover.

437
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,990
It'll spawn one, one branch.

438
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,970
Oh, that's so true.

439
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,810
I want,

440
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,750
I want, I want...

441
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:58,670
If I go to Off-Kai, I want Off-Kai to have a Blackjack table that I will sit at.

442
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,690
And we can play Blackjack together.

443
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,030
If I go to Off-Kai Expo.

444
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,310
I realized that Off-Kai Expo might be a bad time for me.

445
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,370
So hopefully...

446
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,750
I can go.

447
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,370
Well, I wasn't invited or anything, but you know.

448
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,030
If I'm invited...

449
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,030
If I'm invited...

450
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,230
And if I can go.

451
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,330
Busy with events?

452
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:30,990
Yeah.

453
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,690
There's two important things happening.

454
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,770
I think Off-Kai Expo is in June, right?

455
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,030
Off-Kai Liars Bar, let's go.

456
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,590
Yeah, oh my gosh.

457
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,170
It's kind of like the...

458
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,990
At Tokyo Game Show, there was the...

459
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,130
I wonder if they could bring that to Off-Kai.

460
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,990
At Tokyo Game Show, the developers of...

461
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,590
What was it?

462
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,830
What was it?

463
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:05,740
The...

464
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,460
Buckshot Roulette!

465
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,560
Buckshot Roulette, they had the actual table.

466
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,460
Something similar to that...

468
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,960
Could go.

469
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,740
I think.

470
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,960
You mean Backshot?

471
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,900
Backshot?

472
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,560
Oh, did I get it wrong?

473
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,660
Wait, Backshot Roulette.

474
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,140
Oh...

475
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,860
Wait, did I get it wrong?

476
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,380
Not again.

477
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,140
Buckshot.

478
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,020
Did I mess up?

479
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,500
Wait, which one?

480
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,020
Which one?

481
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,240
You

482
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,800
guys are making me question everything.

483
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,740
The B... The B-Shot Roulette.

484
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,480
There we go, I'll just call it that.

485
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,020
I'm scared.

486
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,190
The B-Shot Roulette.

487
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,030
Okay, I'm gonna dash.

488
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,470
Spooky music!

489
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,530
Look at these little guys, they're so cute.

490
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,910
Gosh, these guys are fast.

491
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,530
Oh my god, they're so fast.

492
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,850
Now obviously I wanna do...

493
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,810
How are you like this every time?

494
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:42,450
If you go to A-Sen next year, then I will go to A-Sen one last time before I retire from it.

495
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,950
Why are you gonna retire from it?

496
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,590
I really like A-Sen.

497
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,960
Give me my stuff.

498
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,260
We're gonna try for the... The build.

499
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,680
I can't remember what it's called.

500
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,420
Box up tops?

501
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Oh, that's right!

502
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,960
I did... I took a...

503
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh, you're right, you're right.

504
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,580
I took a...

505
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,720
This picture for the thumbnail.

506
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,020
I forgot about it.

507
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,580
In the thumbnail picture I got one of the special ones.

508
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,950
Membership stuff ain't working on my phone.

509
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,870
So here's my money.

510
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,930
No, faster!

511
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,670
Freak-a-deek phantom.

512
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,070
Card is good early on.

513
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,730
That is true.

514
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,390
It's like a first thing.

515
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,430
Okay, I'll take it.

516
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,070
You know what?

517
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:43,530
It's fine.

518
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,890
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

519
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,650
There's so many of them.

520
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,590
Oh, I was trapped by... Oh my gosh.

521
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,890
Trapped by...

522
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,050
Burger pumpkin.

523
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,870
Sorry, I have burger on the brain.

524
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,790
I'm not hungry.

525
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,270
I'm just thinking about burgers.

526
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,780
Burger.

527
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,620
Did they let you keep the wisp inflatable?

528
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,600
No!

529
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,340
Which is totally understandable.

530
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,880
lol It was supposed to be like a surprise for us actually.

531
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,780
Oh my goodness.

532
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,300
I gotta get this guy.

533
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,460
Raven feather might be good, right?

534
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,080
I actually haven't used it yet.

535
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,360
Because I got it only recently.

536
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,320
But since it's still early game, right?

537
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,960
lol

538
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,460
Also, I don't really care about the money, so...

539
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,160
Let's go for it.

540
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,620
Hey, healing guy!

541
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,760
Oh my gosh.

542
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,500
Stop healing, please.

543
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Stop healing.

544
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,500
Oh gosh, you suck.

545
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,180
Oh no.

546
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,480
Okay, hold on.

547
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,160
Hold on, I wanna make it through this.

548
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,900
And then I'm gonna...

549
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,860
You do that.

550
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm gonna bait you.

551
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,780
Yeah, I'm gonna bait you.

552
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,600
I'm gonna bait you.

553
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,080
Okay, I'm just gonna...

554
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,920
I'm scared.

555
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,300
They're still coming through.

556
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,020
Just live.

557
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,100
Thanks, Naomi.

558
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,040
Awakened.

559
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,780
Oh, I need to buy... I was like, wait a second.

560
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,700
I was trying to remember what I needed for...

561
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,460
For the thing.

562
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,280
Okay, yes, spider.

563
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,240
Spider, spider.

564
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,860
Sputter, sputter, sputter, sputter.

565
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,980
Don't feel bad.

566
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,320
I really hope you don't feel bad.

567
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,400
You didn't have to donate one.

568
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:11,980
Thank you.

569
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,400
You didn't have to donate the gifted.

570
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,200
Thank you though.

571
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,740
Don't feel bad, seriously.

572
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:16,940
Seriously.

573
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,640
It was so... It was so...

574
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,140
Non-malicious, you guys.

575
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,930
What song is this?

576
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,670
She's forgiven for now.

577
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,050
Oh, it's Mythretree!

578
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,250
I was like, wait a second.

579
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,610
I'm stupid.

580
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,700
Nice.

581
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,300
I'm just gonna keep going.

582
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,140
Wait, what's the other thing that I need?

583
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,820
Spider cooking?

584
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,020
It's... Let me just look it up.

585
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,500
The bucket.

586
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:16,640
Bucket.

587
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,080
This is what you call willing it into existence.

588
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,140
And then we also need the uber sheep.

589
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,880
Nice.

590
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,420
I want probably also the...

591
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,080
What is it?

592
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,940
The idol outfit.

593
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,640
What just dropped?

594
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,160
Oh, gosh.

595
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,160
Actually, this is...

596
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,140
I think this one is good.

597
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Especially for fun.

598
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,880
I can't take ubers.

599
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,620
I can only take lifts because uber banned me for some reason.

600
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't know why.

601
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,860
I'm not quite sure why.

602
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,960
One day they were just like, I can't ride uber anymore.

603
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,100
I was like, okay.

604
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,160
Maybe it has to do...

605
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,640
I don't know, actually.

606
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,880
Maybe it has to do with me being banned from PayPal.

607
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,580
I don't know.

608
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,280
Too freaky.

609
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,320
Yeah, probably scared some people, right?

610
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,160
Of picking me up.

611
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,020
These guys aren't so tough.

612
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
What did you say?

613
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,720
Oh, hold to guarantee?

614
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,740
True.

615
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,620
But what if something good also is in the next one?

616
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,340
We're safe.

617
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,760
These bats are memos.

618
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,120
Nurse's horn.

619
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,110
Banned for haunting the driver.

620
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,550
Would it be... I'm gonna ask though.

621
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,330
Should I hold the bandage?

622
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,970
Or do you think that won't be any...

623
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,980
Bandage is also good for fun.

624
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,400
Hold bandage.

625
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,160
Hold.

626
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,360
Hold.

627
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,000
Hold.

628
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,020
And horn.

629
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,720
Horn, of course, is very good for fauna.

630
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,180
Fauna.

631
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,940
Fauna sweep.

632
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,800
Fauna is gonna lead us to victory, everybody.

633
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,180
Who hurt me?

634
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,280
Who hurt me?

635
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,260
How did I get take... Where did I take damage from?

636
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,380
From a...

637
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Oh my god.

638
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,060
I don't remember what that stinky guy is.

639
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,920
I'm worried about getting too many items and...

640
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,050
Not being able to get uber shape, but...

641
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,030
Bandage doesn't do much.

642
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,470
Even though you heal.

643
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,950
Focus on collab.

644
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,350
True.

645
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,050
I think that's a smarter...

646
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,510
Decision as well.

647
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,150
It's okay.

648
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,530
Bandage, I feel, pops up so often.

649
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,110
Anytime I need what I need...

650
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,390
And what I need never happens, you know what I mean?

651
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,270
Eliminate items.

652
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,410
I don't know what I want yet though.

653
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,110
Or I know what I want, but I don't know...

654
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:21,610
You know what I love is...

655
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,470
This one.

656
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,610
The tears and the balls.

657
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,770
I want that one.

658
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,510
I do want that.

659
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,150
Rap Dog.

660
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,130
What's that one?

661
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,910
This one?

662
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,010
Tears are stored in the balls.

663
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,590
Stop.

664
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,760
So maybe we go for this one.

665
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,660
And then, I like this one.

666
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,340
I want to try for that.

667
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,060
I want to get the limiter, but I will...

668
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,700
Refrain.

669
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,080
Oh, X-Potato.

670
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,900
Okay, critical.

671
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,900
And I'm going to enchant...

672
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,680
Everything we get.

673
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,140
Everything we need, we will enchant.

674
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,240
Do not fret.

675
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,060
Do not fret.

676
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,220
We will enchant, especially because it's cheap.

677
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,080
It's less expensive.

678
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,800
Don't get surrounded.

679
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,620
Too scary.

680
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,390
Minto makes our... Don't say that.

681
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,950
Don't say that.

682
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,770
Reconsider your words, please.

683
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,750
Reconsider...

684
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,890
What you are putting out on the internet.

685
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,090
Please.

686
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,230
Where did that guy come from?

687
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,470
I like how the hard stages...

688
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,310
Even have like a theme change, kind of.

689
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,370
I mean, obviously, this is still spooky, but like...

690
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,670
It's fun that it's not just the same stage, but more guys.

691
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:38,970
I think.

692
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,630
Yeah, music is so good.

693
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,530
I'm just running around.

694
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,870
A little shuba-shuba.

695
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,050
Who's coming?

696
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,130
Oh, these guys.

697
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,690
You know what?

698
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,630
I don't feel like dealing with them.

699
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,390
Oh, what did I get?

700
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,210
Flower!

701
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,380
I'm just gonna...

702
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,100
I'm just gonna chill in here while these guys pass.

703
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,940
Okay, they've passed.

704
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,200
They've passed, they've passed.

705
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,460
Do -do-do-do.

706
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,340
That was so close.

707
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,400
Literally grazed that.

708
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,700
I may be a Touhou player.

709
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,600
The ball!

710
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,350
Flower.

711
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,650
Touhou maxer.

712
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:02,930
I think Minto is closer and comfier vibes... Wait, what are you saying about me?

713
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,050
Between being soft and comfy like Fauna...

714
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,750
And gremlin and kusagaki like Minto, what do you think your friends would say about you?

715
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,990
I was not in stream and got a membo shippal.

716
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,150
I think you need to re-change your name, Lindsay.

717
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,850
You're not the weakest jailbird.

718
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,650
You're the luckiest jailbird.

719
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,950
I'm gonna hold...

720
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:37,630
My ball.

721
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:43,470
Sheesh!

722
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,350
What are these guys?

723
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,110
What are they doing?

724
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,990
Why did they... Why did they Metal Gear?

725
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:49,990
I took it.

726
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,410
What are they doing?

727
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,590
Wait, no, no, no, not yet, not yet, not yet.

728
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:05,760
Damage.

729
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,360
No ice.

730
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,350
Thank you for dash reminder.

731
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:15,630
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

732
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,730
Oh, I'm stuck.

733
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,040
Ducky, thanks for the five gifted.

734
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
No need to think about... Too hard about it.

735
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,500
Minto, I hate socks.

736
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,320
They make my feet itchy.

737
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,800
No, I love socks.

738
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,680
I always...

739
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,160
Okay, ball.

740
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,920
Idol song!

741
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,000
This is the one, right?

742
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,000
Hold on, let me double check.

743
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,160
Yes.

744
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,520
Oh gosh, I was stuck in the wall.

745
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,100
No!

746
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,140
Oh my god, please let me get my box.

747
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,420
Rap Dog is happening.

748
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,740
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

749
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,970
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

750
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,120
Game fun.

751
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,820
Game fun.

752
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,060
Game silly.

753
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,900
Game good time.

754
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,280
I don't think I have anything that has a negative effect though.

755
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,660
I don't, I don't.

756
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,140
Eliminate?

757
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,720
I'm not gonna eliminate it.

758
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,600
Raven feather.

759
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,120
I don't think the... Okay, correct me if I'm wrong.

760
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,460
Because the raven feather effects are not in red, so I feel that does not count as a negative effect.

761
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,420
Right?

762
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,060
I think that's how it works.

763
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,040
Are you a Pokemon?

764
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,780
Because I can make you squirtle.

765
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,180
I love Gengar.

766
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,780
I love Gengar.

767
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,900
Yeah, red is negative, right?

768
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,780
So I feel like it wouldn't, it wouldn't do anything.

769
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,740
Gengar based.

770
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,140
Right?

771
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,980
It's so cute!

772
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,500
Okay, I'm just gonna...

773
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,080
Kusogaki plus gorilla.

774
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,000
Oh, I know!

775
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,120
It would be so good.

776
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,900
I'm gonna hold it.

777
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,140
We'll put a pin in it.

778
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,200
I'll think about it.

779
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,280
I'll consider it.

780
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,040
I'll consider.

781
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,770
Oh, this guy.

782
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,050
I don't remember what he does.

783
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,030
Like, I don't remember what the different colors are.

784
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,170
Oh my god, there's two of them!

785
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:26,590
Oh, I think he's making me slow and the other guy maybe hurt my attack.

786
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,590
Well, he's gone now, so it doesn't matter.

787
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:31,970
She's out!

788
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,410
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

789
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,490
Red buffs enemy damage.

790
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,310
So blue makes you slow, red buffs enemy.

791
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:39,790
Or red hurts.

792
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,470
Okay, okay, okay.

793
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,510
Hurts your attack.

794
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:41,990
Okay, okay.

795
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,470
Green heal.

796
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,610
Red attack, blue speed.

797
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,010
Got it, got it, got it.

798
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,050
I know what green did.

799
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,830
I don't wanna keep holding it.

800
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,880
I don't know.

801
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,960
Drop it.

802
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,760
Shackle only prevents coin loss, not attack debuff.

803
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,860
No, no, no.

804
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,820
Shackles are for any negative effect.

805
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,120
So like, for example, the gorilla paw.

806
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,880
You know how it boosts your attack, but weakens your critical damage.

807
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,280
Then it makes it so that it only boosts your attack.

808
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,520
The red numbers.

809
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,920
You can turn any Pokemon into a ghost-type Pokemon by using...

811
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,260
Brick evolution stone.

812
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,550
It's so... No!

813
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,270
You don't need it.

814
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:05,710
Okay!

815
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:06,990
I do!

816
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,430
Okay, fine.

817
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:08,550
Fine.

818
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,570
Oh, but I want it!

819
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,610
Okay, fine.

820
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,290
Goodbye.

821
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,710
They just never show up.

822
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,450
The Kusagaki shackles never show up for me.

823
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,450
So whenever I see them I'm like, oh, I have this urge to grab it.

824
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,030
You know what I mean?

825
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,490
Stop healing!

826
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,650
You ugly!

827
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,050
What do we need?

828
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:27,530
Okay.

829
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,850
Let's... Since we're working on these, let's enchant.

830
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,330
And if you guys see the...

831
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,990
If you guys see the tears, please let me know so that I grab it, you know?

832
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,210
Stop healing!

833
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:45,330
Stop it!

834
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,330
Stop healing!

835
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,710
Okay, he's gone.

836
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:59,790
Because sometimes I get so focused on some things that I completely forget, you know?

837
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:01,970
I forget.

838
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,550
Idle song!

839
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,130
Eat.

840
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,130
Where is my Uber Sheep?

841
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,330
Uber Sheep, please!

842
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:17,470
Come to me!

843
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,710
Uber Sheep!

844
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:28,790
Everybody, this is what... This is a manifestation.

845
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,310
Manifestation works, baby!

846
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:39,390
We'll go with the horn.

847
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:41,370
Sorry.

848
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,140
Ball.

849
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,420
Update.

850
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,080
Credit card.

851
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,520
I'm chilling in here.

852
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,900
I'm not worried about anything until it disappears.

853
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:02,460
Oh!

854
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,280
Nice!

855
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,640
Slow!

856
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,720
Slow, slow!

857
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,340
Oh no!

858
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:08,780
Oh no!

859
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:09,440
Okay.

860
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,220
Ball!

861
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,520
Ball!

862
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,160
We're balling!

863
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:14,720
We're balling!

864
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,200
We're balling!

865
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:15,720
We're balling!

866
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,220
We're balling!

867
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,740
We're balling!

868
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,380
What was that?

869
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:18,900
We're balling!

870
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,400
We're balling!

871
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:19,960
We're balling!

872
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,460
Oh gosh, there's so many things.

873
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,460
Enchant.

874
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,720
Idle song.

875
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,160
Did you get Uber Sheep?

876
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:34,880
Yes.

877
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:35,840
What did it cost?

878
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,900
Kusogaki Shackle.

879
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:37,740
True.

880
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,200
Size.

881
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:41,680
Nice.

882
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,020
Nice, nice, nice.

883
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,460
I'd love to see it.

884
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,440
What?

885
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,400
Oh, what?

886
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,140
I don't understand what they quite do there.

887
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,540
They just like freak out?

888
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,020
Freakazoid freak out?

889
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,080
Oh my gosh.

890
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,640
Oh my god.

891
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:57,980
They're coming.

892
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:58,620
Greed!

893
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,360
Guys, I can't accept greed today.

894
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,040
Oh my god.

895
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,580
Oh my god.

896
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,640
What the hell?

897
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,720
This ain't looking so good, you guys.

898
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,320
I'm just saying.

899
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,830
They're all charging me.

900
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:21,570
Please!

901
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,520
Let's enchant.

902
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,840
I'm just gonna enchant it.

903
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,800
Oh my gosh.

904
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,980
I don't know why I seriously can't remember to dash, you guys.

905
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,040
I don't know why this is so difficult for me to remember.

906
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,600
I truly wish I could give you an answer.

907
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,440
I truly wish I could tell you...

908
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,040
Oh, I just... You know, I'm being silly goofy and choosing not to...

909
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,040
Not to do it because I'm so...

910
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,040
Whatever.

911
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,020
I just don't know.

912
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,580
Because new thing hard to remember?

913
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm just... I'm an old dog!

914
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,180
It's hard for me to learn new tricks!

915
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,220
Oh shit.

916
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,060
I'm so not... I'm so in trouble.

917
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:30,800
Maybe.

918
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,560
Maybe not.

919
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,240
Maybe I'm good.

920
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:40,910
Come here.

921
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,810
Oh my gosh.

922
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,190
Please.

923
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,970
Oh my god.

924
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,750
He throws things so fast.

925
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:50,960
Okay.

926
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,740
We got one.

927
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,080
We got one down.

928
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,400
I don't know who it was, but... Oh, I think it was Chupa Chupa Chupa.

929
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,060
Oh my god.

930
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,020
I can't dodge these.

931
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,620
I'm stupid.

932
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,240
Toho.

933
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,720
Toho, save me.

934
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,510
Idle song max!

935
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,310
Silly minky tricks are for kids!

936
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,130
Save her, Toho.

937
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,130
Save me.

938
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,010
Save me, girl.

939
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:31,790
Really hot girl.

940
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,150
Save me.

941
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,640
Oh no.

942
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,160
Sorry.

943
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,500
X-Potato!

944
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,740
X-Potato!

945
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,680
Okay.

946
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,680
I was going in for that, but good thing I didn't.

947
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,480
I just realized I don't have the golden hammer though.

948
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,140
I don't have a golden hammer.

949
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,320
So...

950
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,740
The collab is useless until... Yeah, I need level 50.

951
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,260
Where is my gold for these two?

952
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,540
Where is my gold anvil?

953
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,080
What the heck?

954
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,440
And where are my tears?

955
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,260
Right here.

956
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,960
Oh, it just happened.

957
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,280
Hello, deadbeat.

958
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,200
Excuse me.

959
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:58,840
Excuse me.

960
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,380
Excuse me.

961
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,660
Wait a sec.

962
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,760
Oh yeah, it won't let me do it.

963
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,260
Okay, not yet.

964
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,640
Yippee!

965
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,960
Drop some hot beats!

966
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:20,050
Yes.

967
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:20,870
Potatoes everywhere.

968
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:27,290
Nice!

969
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:31,530
Nice!

970
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:33,410
Easy.

971
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:34,490
Easy.

972
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:35,890
Easy mode.

973
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,430
Where are my tears?

974
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,390
I don't want to eliminate anything yet.

975
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,170
I don't want to eliminate anything yet.

976
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:51,370
We might have to do like a combo, you know, towards the end.

977
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,470
Mint taxpayer.

978
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,490
Thanks, Minkerton.

979
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,550
Why is there a tax?

980
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,040
Oh, thanks for 299, you guys!

981
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,120
Thank you!

982
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,260
We're so close.

983
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,820
Psycho axe.

984
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,260
It does have the enchantment on it.

985
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,980
I guess I'll take it.

986
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,180
And money.

987
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,960
Give me money!

988
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,080
Why does it give me money at this point?

989
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,900
Neither of my things are full.

990
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,440
That's so strange.

991
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,220
That's so strange.

992
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,260
Oh, wait, what did it just drop?

993
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,200
What did it just drop?

994
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:44,800
Where is it?

995
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,160
Oh, there.

996
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,380
Binoculars.

997
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
For the tears.

998
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,140
Thank you.

999
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,680
Thank you for your tears!

1000
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,040
CEO tears, where are you?

1001
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,990
Who do you think would outgaslight the other?

1002
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,070
Crony or Doki?

1003
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,550
The thing about Doki is she folds.

1004
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,590
She folds, you know?

1005
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:22,370
Gosh, why...

1006
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,330
I like the slow stamp, but...

1007
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,990
I think Doki would fold, yeah.

1008
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,450
Yeah, easily Crony.

1009
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,650
I think Crony would like, you know, Crony...

1010
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:41,730
Crony would...

1011
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,710
Can hold her own.

1012
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,290
Doki panics too easily.

1013
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,160
I think.

1014
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,520
What are you guys doing?

1015
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,680
What are you guys doing in here?

1016
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,140
Oh...

1017
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,820
Okay, I'm still.

1018
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,140
Oh gosh, I'm still.

1019
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,120
Oh gosh, I was still.

1020
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,340
Okay.

1021
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,700
Now you guys are walking.

1022
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,020
Okay.

1023
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,980
Oh, nevermind.

1024
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,280
You're just all over the place, it's fine.

1025
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,500
I don't need to ult, I don't need to ult yet.

1026
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,340
I'm good, I'm good for now.

1027
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:20,260
Dash out?

1028
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,000
No, I'm fine.

1029
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,560
We're fine, we're okay.

1030
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:22,700
Okay.

1031
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,680
I was strong.

1032
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,500
Honestly, my balls are killing it.

1033
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,660
Stop failing!

1034
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,640
That's right.

1035
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:41,980
Yeah,

1036
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,100
let's just do that.

1037
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,300
Where are my CEO tears?

1038
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,080
My balls are killing it.

1039
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,050
Limiter?

1040
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,030
I want it.

1041
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:33,050
Wait, is there anything else that I... No, I guess there's nothing else that I need.

1042
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,690
I love Limiter.

1043
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:38,910
Wall and ball?

1044
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,950
Wait, wall and ball?

1045
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:42,750
What is that?

1046
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:44,390
Oh wait, actually I don't remember.

1047
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,910
Wall and ball is...

1048
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:53,310
Wait, is that the one that just creates the...

1049
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,950
No, I don't remember this one.

1050
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:59,450
That's what I'll say to my future wife after our third kid's...

1051
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,230
Okay, I'll reroll.

1052
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,230
Okay, I'll reroll.

1053
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:06,890
Okay, I'll reroll.

1054
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,460
Okay, I'll reroll.

1055
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,160
Increased damage of any character skill attacks by 33%.

1056
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,180
The beetle?

1057
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:51,700
Okay.

1058
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,860
For some reason, I always thought the beetle was the... was the... this.

1059
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:57,820
You know?

1060
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,160
And so... Or the character skill was this.

1061
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,900
So I was like, wait, I don't need this for Fauna.

1062
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,520
Yeah, this for the branches.

1063
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,100
So true.

1064
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,380
So true!

1065
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,440
So true, we'll beetle, we'll beetle, we'll beetle, we'll beetle.

1066
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:17,460
See, that's why I don't mind playing with you guys, because you sometimes help me see different perspectives of things.

1067
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,740
So thanks guys.

1068
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,860
Oh, I just walked straight into that.

1069
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,200
So thanks guys for... I appreciate it.

1070
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,720
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

1071
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,000
Bonk, bonk.

1072
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,220
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1073
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,740
Who even reads skill tags?

1074
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,060
I... What if there was... What if there... Is there like an aesthetic only run?

1075
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,760
Aesthetic only run, please.

1076
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,240
Just go with the axe.

1077
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,500
I'm never getting tears at this point.

1078
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,110
There it is.

1079
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:09,130
How would that even work?

1080
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,450
How would that even work?

1081
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,080
Oh my goodness.

1082
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,540
Wait.

1083
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,300
Oh, oh gosh.

1084
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:29,800
Oh my god.

1085
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,700
Wait, I can't remember!

1086
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,660
I think I made it.

1087
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,590
RGB stramp.

1088
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,630
Rainbow plus trumpet.

1089
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,090
Membership.

1090
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,250
I feel like I could use a membership.

1091
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,490
If only I had the shackles.

1092
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,970
If only I had the shackles.

1093
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,310
It would be so good.

1094
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,550
Membership is pay to win.

1095
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:18,670
I have a lot of coins, so honestly it's not bad if I take it.

1096
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:23,990
Like I said, I'm not... I'm not doing this for the coins, so...

1097
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:29,810
Five minutes of membership only costs 900 coins.

1098
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:30,250
Oh!

1099
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,170
And we have, what, five minutes left.

1100
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:33,690
Let's do it.

1101
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:41,130
I'm convinced I'm never getting CEO tears.

1102
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:45,070
I'm convinced it will never happen.

1103
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:46,750
Oh, what was that?

1104
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,490
Oh, there it is.

1105
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Green girl power.

1106
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,640
Green girl power!

1107
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,970
I hate the balls with the Ian curse.

1108
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,450
I hate it.

1109
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,410
I hate it.

1110
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:15,070
Oh my god, I hate... I hate it!

1111
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,190
It's so annoying!

1112
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:21,210
It's so... Why am I having to play... Damn!

1113
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,870
Rocket League at the same time!

1114
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,050
It's so bad!

1115
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,010
Eliminate it?

1116
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:28,590
I will.

1117
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,270
And I'll feel good doing it.

1118
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:30,870
Goodbye!

1119
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:31,350
Goodbye!

1120
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,450
Goodbye!

1121
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:34,650
Goodbye!

1122
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,410
Goodbye!

1123
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:39,570
I felt good doing that.

1124
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,050
I felt cathartic.

1125
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:48,410
Goodbye... Ian cursed balls.

1126
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,520
I walked right into that.

1127
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,780
KFP are so silly.

1128
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,380
So cute.

1129
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,340
I swear to god.

1130
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,480
Doriga, I swear to god.

1131
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:24,960
Don't ever, don't ever, don't ever bring up Hayley Joel Osment in front of me.

1132
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,420
I have had a rivalry with that guy for... I don't even know.

1133
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,980
As long as I can remember.

1134
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,420
I hate him!

1135
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:42,880
I have never wanted to destroy someone more in my life than Hayley Joel Osment!

1136
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,880
I hate him!

1137
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,760
I hate him because his face is too small for his head!

1138
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,540
And it's not natural!

1139
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,640
And I can't stand that it's normal!

1140
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:08,020
I can't... I... I... I'm not a folder, but I have videos of people that look like him and I just... I watch them to fuel my anger!

1141
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,780
Oh my god.

1142
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,260
Why?

1143
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,400
It's not... I hate him!

1144
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,700
I will never be okay with him existing.

1145
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,240
I will one day destroy him with my own two hands!

1146
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,400
I swear!

1147
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,280
Oh my god.

1148
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,440
Stop calling me Hayley Joel Osment, please!

1149
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:39,020
I have had this... I've had this... I've had... I've had... I've... I've hated this man!

1150
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:49,900
I'm seeing stars.

1151
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,420
Oh my god, hold on.

1152
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,280
I have to compose myself.

1153
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,500
I think I'm alright.

1154
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,420
Re-roll!

1155
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,430
Re-roll!

1156
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,510
Re-roll!

1157
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,620
Raging some rando?

1158
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,840
No, he's not a rando.

1159
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,460
What are you talking about?

1160
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:52,390
He's... He's unfortunately famous and I hate that for him.

1161
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:56,590
He's my arch nemesis.

1162
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,850
You know what?

1163
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,970
I'm just gonna go with the axe.

1164
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,470
Gosh dang it.

1165
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,180
Everybody has like an arch nemesis and that guy is mine.

1166
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,050
His face is not natural.

1167
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,970
That really freaks me out and so when I see pictures of him...

1168
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:29,270
It makes me really freaked out, okay guys?

1169
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:29,450
Please!

1170
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:34,850
Yeah!

1171
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:36,150
We did it!

1172
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,610
We did it!

1173
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,850
We're here!

1174
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,030
Nice.

1175
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,370
Nice, nice.

1176
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:46,730
Super collab!

1177
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:48,470
Yeah!

1178
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:51,990
You know what?

1179
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:52,730
Upgrade.

1180
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,170
I'll wait for the other one.

1181
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:03,690
Maybe we'll, you know, maybe we'll get...

1182
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,190
Oh shoot.

1183
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,770
Maybe we'll get CEO tears.

1184
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:11,510
Who knows?

1185
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:13,310
Maybe.

1186
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,550
You know, maybe it'll happen.

1187
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:15,330
Someday.

1188
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,760
I don't like Dash from the Incredibles for a similar reason actually.

1189
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,140
Dagger for the axe.

1190
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,720
Wait, what's that one?

1191
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,640
Oh, yeah.

1192
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:37,940
Let's...

1193
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,960
We can do that and then we can...

1194
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,060
Maybe hope for the tears later.

1195
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,720
I understand that comparison.

1196
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,580
It's like, oh my gosh, there was that one episode of Rick and Morty, like the tiny people or whatever.

1197
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,720
It's the same thing.

1198
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,760
Thank you, thank you.

1199
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:02,300
Kiss.

1200
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,080
Kiss.

1201
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,440
Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.

1202
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:09,480
No.

1203
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,490
No.

1204
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,020
I also forgot I can upgrade this.

1205
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:21,240
Wait.

1206
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,140
Yeah.

1207
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,020
Upgrade!

1208
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:29,140
Hayley Joel Osment has all the CEO... Is it Osment?

1209
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,920
Os-mend?

1210
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:31,900
I don't know.

1211
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,380
That's how little I ever care to think about him.

1212
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,080
Except when I'm plotting his demise.

1213
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:45,990
Oh, they're yelling at me.

1214
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:46,830
Okay, enchant.

1215
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:55,930
Osment.

1216
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:56,430
No!

1217
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,110
That's not it.

1218
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,190
That's not it.

1219
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,820
Guys, how are we feeling about this run, huh?

1220
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,720
How are we feeling about this run?

1221
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,860
Hayley Joel phantom art being made right now.

1222
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,980
I've already seen it, unfortunately.

1223
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:26,960
I literally stopped looking at my hashtags because of how much people were posting stuff.

1224
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,920
I was like, I can't look again today.

1225
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,000
I'll look tomorrow, maybe.

1226
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:31,900
I don't know.

1227
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:32,820
I'm scared.

1228
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,160
I don't feel safe.

1229
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,780
I feel uncomfortable.

1230
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:40,800
I feel everything, every bad emotion anybody can feel about something.

1231
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,200
Sick to my stomach, just... Oh, ouch.

1232
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:44,820
Oh my God.

1233
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:47,600
I didn't know which way he was charging at me.

1234
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,120
Oh, we got him.

1235
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,040
I've

1236
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,100
done nothing to you but plot your demise.

1237
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:00,360
I don't

1238
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,700
wanna see his face anymore, please.

1239
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:19,880
I

1240
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:24,340
can't...

1241
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,440
He must be stopped.

1242
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,040
I don't like him.

1243
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:54,630
Ninja headband.

1244
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:57,690
Do I have any melee weapons?

1245
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:02,370
Do my balls count as melee weapons?

1246
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,990
I know my owl dagger and the...

1247
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,330
Axe counts?

1248
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:11,990
Okay, I'll drop it.

1249
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,270
I feel sick to my stomach.

1250
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,500
You gotta focus.

1251
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,700
I gotta... Yeah, you're right.

1252
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,600
I won't let... See, I'm telling you.

1253
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,960
He's my arch nemesis.

1254
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,300
He's trying to...

1255
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:47,220
Oh, tears, please.

1256
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:48,880
I'm okay.

1257
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:51,720
I'm okay.

1258
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,020
I'm focused.

1259
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:55,760
My head is in the game.

1260
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,320
My head is in the game.

1261
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,840
We're fine.

1262
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,260
Thank you for the pink, though.

1263
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,520
The kid that can see dead people.

1264
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,600
Yeah, I think so.

1265
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,480
Koiyuki, thanks for the gifted!

1266
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,620
Alright, owl dagger.

1267
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,520
You're a wispy... No.

1268
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:24,700
No, he's not.

1269
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,700
He's not welcome here.

1270
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,860
He's not welcome here.

1271
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,240
He's the original of the small phase.

1272
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,760
It's just not right.

1273
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:34,680
Oh!

1274
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,460
Isle costume!

1275
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:37,320
Wait.

1276
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,370
It's so late now, but it should be...

1277
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,400
I wanna max dagger.

1278
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,800
With 30 seconds.

1279
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,440
I know!

1280
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,020
Max dagger.

1281
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,980
Get away from me.

1282
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:13,980
Oh my goodness.

1283
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:14,840
What is going on?

1284
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,500
Okay, we're fine.

1285
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,900
Oh my god.

1286
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:25,660
We're fine.

1287
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,380
Everything's fine.

1288
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,680
Everything's cool.

1289
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,240
We're chill.

1290
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,380
Everything's fine.

1291
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,080
Oh my god.

1292
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,600
Oh my god.

1293
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,320
What in the...

1294
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:37,920
Oh my god.

1295
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,560
Oh my god.

1296
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:44,500
I just nearly... Died for real.

1297
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,000
I got stuck on the wall.

1298
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,610
Where's my... Oh my god.

1299
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:09,050
Please.

1300
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,570
Two!

1301
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,380
Wawa's coming for you.

1302
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,600
She's so fast!

1303
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,860
Wawa!

1304
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,360
What?

1305
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,460
Didn't I... Did I hear a...

1306
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,000
A thingy?

1307
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,760
Oh my goodness.

1308
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,660
Sorry, Kiwawa.

1309
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,060
A anvil?

1310
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:43,010
Yeah, Ducky!

1311
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:44,970
Attack up!

1312
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:47,050
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1313
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:47,930
We're doing it?

1314
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:52,130
Gotta be a nightmare anytime you play Kingdom Hearts.

1315
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,610
Just don't think about them.

1316
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,330
Where is...

1317
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,600
First try!

1318
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,240
We did it!

1319
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,440
We did it!

1320
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:11,880
We did it!

1321
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,440
We did it!

1322
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,740
That was so fast!

1323
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,980
Phono sweep!

1324
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,020
Phono sweep!

1325
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,040
Phono sweep!

1326
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,040
Phono sweep!

1327
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,040
Yay!

1328
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,680
Yay, yay, yay!

1329
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,380
I was really hoping that...

1330
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:35,520
I could go to a show and see Fauna perform at it, you know?

1331
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,160
I'm so... I'm so... I'm so salty.

1332
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,700
I didn't go to New York now.

1333
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,360
I was just like...

1334
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,440
I should've gone!

1335
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,480
I should've gone!

1336
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,540
I had no idea!

1337
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,080
But...

1338
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,500
It's OK.

1339
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:03,960
Maya!

1340
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,040
Welcome to membership!

1341
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,060
Thank you!

1342
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,580
Phono sweep!

1343
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,600
Double green Oshilo!

1344
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,720
Thank you!

1345
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,160
Yeah, I...

1346
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,020
I went to the one at AWA, right?

1347
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,620
But I... Oh my gosh.

1348
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:40,140
And I was really excited because it was my first ever holo concert.

1349
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,800
And I was really excited to see them actually on stage.

1350
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,420
But I feel that...

1351
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:53,420
I feel that maybe they should've considered what the stage looked like.

1352
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:56,460
Or rather, they should've...

1353
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:57,360
Maybe...

1354
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,080
The stage was way too low.

1355
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,420
It was so...

1356
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,040
Oh my gosh.

1357
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,120
When people were asking me, they were like, how was the concert?

1358
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,880
I was like, it sounded great.

1359
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,680
It sounded good because they sounded good.

1360
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,480
I would sometimes see Kiara's hat.

1361
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:20,620
Or I would sometimes see Ina's halo.

1362
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,520
I'd be like...

1363
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,440
And then also there were pillars.

1364
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:28,260
And I also couldn't see above people's heads.

1365
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,680
But the side screens...

1366
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:36,260
I don't wanna just look at the side screens because that's basically what I watch when I'm watching them do a concert on YouTube.

1367
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,440
I wanna see them on the stage.

1368
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,280
And so...

1369
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,480
I was like...

1370
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,820
You know, I'm 100% for people standing up during a concert.

1371
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,040
I hate when people are sitting...

1372
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:54,100
And I wanna stand up and then someone gets mad at me for standing.

1373
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,460
I hate that.

1374
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:59,500
But this was the only time I've ever thought, oh my gosh.

1375
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:04,280
I know I'm short and I can't see much, but...

1376
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,980
Even floating a little bit.

1377
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:07,820
But I was like, no.

1378
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,320
I think people should've sat for it.

1379
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,300
For that one.

1380
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:12,700
Just that one.

1381
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:14,900
Because...

1382
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:18,020
Or, like, I think they should consider...

1383
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,560
You know, having...

1384
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,160
Maybe, you know, when they do the Hololive, like...

1385
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,220
Stages in 3D.

1386
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,300
Like, having them...

1387
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,020
Having different versions where, like, you know...

1388
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,300
Oh, we see what the stage is like.

1389
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,100
We're gonna have you guys perform on the top...

1390
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:33,700
Of, like, the...

1391
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,220
Of, you know...

1392
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,000
How do I...

1393
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,720
Like, the steps.

1394
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:37,960
Or something like that, you know?

1395
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,380
Something like that.

1396
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:42,540
We all sat down for the yapping.

1397
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,420
No, that's just how MC works.

1398
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,840
You sit when there's MC...

1399
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,600
And then you stand when there's a performance.

1400
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,120
That's, like...

1401
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,360
So normal.

1402
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,800
That doesn't even bother me.

1403
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:53,720
But...

1404
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,140
I couldn't even see them then!

1405
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,540
I didn't even...

1406
01:22:58,540 --> 01:22:59,520
I didn't see anything!

1407
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:02,940
But...

1408
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,960
Holofest this year is having a stage in the center...

1409
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,920
And two on the side.

1410
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,800
Not sure how that'll work, but hopefully it will alleviate some of the problems.

1411
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:15,700
Isn't that how it was last year?

1412
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,580
Where they had, like, the different stages that you...

1413
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,200
Like, turned around for?

1414
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,320
I was in the second row and standing most times...

1415
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,540
And it was even too low for me.

1416
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,180
I heard it was a few feet lower than it should have been.

1417
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:28,060
Really?

1418
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:34,880
Last year had three stages.

1419
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,140
They had screens on three sides.

1420
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:40,880
Is that not what you just described?

1421
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:41,940
I think I misunderstood.

1422
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:46,820
But yeah, I was worried.

1423
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,220
Because I was, like, asking people.

1424
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,460
I was like, oh my gosh, was...

1425
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,400
Was our concert the same way?

1426
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,540
Because I was nervous that maybe people didn't see it much.

1427
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,580
But from who I asked, they said that...

1428
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,900
It was good that they could see.

1429
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:02,660
But...

1430
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:04,820
You know...

1431
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,800
And I don't want to entirely blame the convention.

1432
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,960
I think there was maybe just a miscommunication.

1433
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,020
Because it could have been like, you know...

1434
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:14,660
Obviously Hololive is going to do the same exact setup they do.

1435
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,160
But I think they should also, you know...

1436
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,460
Talk to the convention and be like...

1437
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,420
Hey...

1438
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:22,200
How high up is...

1439
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,420
You know...

1440
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,260
You can get a gauge of...

1441
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:30,520
Like, I feel that maybe a lot of convention centers have the same height...

1442
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,380
In terms of stages...

1443
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,020
In a room.

1444
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:36,700
So...

1445
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,220
I think that...

1446
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,820
If they talk to them and were just like...

1447
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:42,220
Oh yeah...

1448
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,220
We're gonna have a version...

1449
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:48,600
Like, where the girls are able to be on steps.

1450
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,680
And perform on the steps of the stage.

1451
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:52,420
You know what I mean?

1452
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,320
Rather than performing on the floor of the stage.

1453
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,760
Is what I'm trying to say.

1454
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,260
Something like that.

1455
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,440
Because if you noticed for Phantom Thief 2...

1456
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,980
Sometimes we would perform on the floor...

1457
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,540
And sometimes we would move up on the steps.

1458
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,820
And then you...

1459
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,460
You know...

1460
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,900
We would kind of move around.

1461
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:14,400
But...

1462
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,120
Yeah...

1463
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,460
I think...

1464
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,120
You know...

1465
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,420
Just so...

1466
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,000
Something like that doesn't happen again.

1467
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,520
I couldn't see them that well and connect the world.

1468
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:25,560
I mean...

1469
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,740
I'm so used to not being able to see much at concerts in general.

1470
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:29,560
So...

1471
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,340
It doesn't truly bother me all that much.

1472
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,800
But I was just like...

1473
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,540
Oh man...

1474
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,040
I would sometimes think that I saw them moving around...

1475
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,120
But it was someone's pen light.

1476
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,220
So I was like...

1477
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:40,440
How...

1478
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,180
I was like...

1479
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,460
How tiny are they?

1480
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,460
You know...

1481
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,280
Like how...

1482
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,900
How teeny tiny are they over there?

1483
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,420
But...

1484
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:51,980
You know...

1485
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,100
It didn't stop me from...

1486
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:54,900
Not having fun.

1487
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,580
So...

1488
01:25:58,580 --> 01:25:59,080
Yeah!

1489
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,300
Oh my gosh, guys.

1490
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:01,660
We did it.

1491
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,400
Hold on, I'm just gonna pick Fona again.

1492
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,520
We did!

1493
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,160
Hard Stage 3!

1494
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,820
And then...

1495
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,740
Stage 4 Hard!

1496
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,980
Stage 4 Hard.

1497
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,720
They said for AWA next year, they'll prep a lot more for Hololive.

1498
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,460
They just never had them before and didn't quite know what to expect.

1499
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,900
I can understand that too.

1500
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,980
I can understand that.

1501
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:40,480
I think the idea of big VTuber concerts being a thing is fairly new.

1502
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,960
So I have confidence people will get better at pulling them off.

1503
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,900
Yes, but also...

1504
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,180
Miku concerts have been a thing for like 10 years.

1505
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,360
And it's like the same exact thing.

1506
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,080
It's nothing different.

1507
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,480
So...

1508
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,480
I'm just saying.

1509
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,120
I'm just saying.

1510
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,120
That maybe...

1511
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,600
We already have the technology.

1512
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,400
You know...

1513
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,660
I'm just saying.

1514
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,640
Gorillas?

1515
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,280
Yeah, even before.

1516
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,480
The concert inspired Pia to be an idol again.

1517
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,700
She killed it.

1518
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,540
She was so great.

1519
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,180
Spray stuck.

1520
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,260
Welcome to membership.

1521
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,220
Thank you.

1522
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:34,540
Thank you, thank you.

1523
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,780
There goes Mint's AWA invite next year.

1524
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,560
No, I'm just saying.

1525
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,680
I mean...

1526
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,860
I'm not criticizing.

1527
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,580
Or rather, I feel like I'm giving valid criticism.

1528
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,760
I don't feel like I'm bashing.

1529
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,660
I'm just saying, hey.

1530
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:54,720
Hey.

1531
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:56,340
That's all I'm saying.

1532
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:59,180
Just wanna say Oishi Spark did a great job for Phantom Thief.

1533
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,380
All the staff were really nice.

1534
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,460
Oh, I'm so glad.

1535
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,840
Constructive criticism.

1536
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,680
That they didn't ask for.

1537
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,860
I have... I'm a VTuber.

1538
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,740
And I must give my opinion.

1539
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,340
I must tell you...

1540
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,260
What to do.

1541
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:22,300
No.

1542
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,140
Unsolicited constructive criticism.

1543
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:27,760
Yeah.

1544
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:29,740
Yeah.

1545
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:35,600
Anyway.

1546
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,560
Guys, what do I need to prepare for stage 4?

1547
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,040
I'm scared.

1548
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,840
Do you think we can do it with Bana again?

1549
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,060
I'm scared.

1550
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,560
Or do I need to do it with someone else?

1551
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:53,830
Your body and soul.

1552
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:55,030
I don't have a body.

1553
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:56,530
I'm only soul.

1554
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:57,590
I'm a ghost.

1555
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,010
Bana is OP.

1556
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:03,970
Do it with Bana.

1557
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:10,900
Okay.

1558
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,360
Minto's Stilt Fund.

1559
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:19,260
And what's even worse is I didn't wear my... I usually wear like a high heel or something.

1560
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,820
I didn't wear any.

1561
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,500
But I don't think it would've made much of a difference.

1562
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,480
Not gonna lie.

1563
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,640
Do you have any upgrades left?

1564
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:25,860
Nope.

1565
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:27,960
I have everything.

1566
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:28,620
I have everything.

1567
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,160
I have everything.

1568
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,240
Okay.

1569
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,500
Moomint has a lot of damage.

1570
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,420
My Moomint...

1571
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:38,000
She's not Gachikoi though.

1572
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,440
She's small, small.

1573
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,800
She's small, small.

1574
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:48,320
That's why I was like Fana or...

1575
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,560
Or Kiara.

1576
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,860
Let's try Fana though.

1577
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,280
I'm sad I only have 188 sessions in Ace Combat.

1578
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:58,300
None.

1579
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,700
Nah.

1580
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,280
Honestly, I'm surprised it's not more.

1581
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:05,640
Okay.

1582
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,820
Here we go!

1583
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,300
Why is this so sca...

1584
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,920
Oh, there's something down here.

1585
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,900
Tiara?

1586
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:25,220
Pfft.

1587
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:28,880
I guess this would be good to get early, right?

1588
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,880
I think I've used it like...

1589
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,740
Trying to...

1590
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:37,900
I think I used it when I was trying to do the sell 10 stamps thing, so...

1591
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,080
Great pull early.

1592
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:41,200
Oh, goodness.

1593
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,320
There's...

1594
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:45,120
There's...

1595
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:45,880
Lightning?

1596
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,660
Oh my goodness.

1597
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,100
Oh my god.

1598
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:49,960
Oh my god.

1599
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,820
These guys are so fast.

1600
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:03,470
They're so fast!

1601
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:06,270
Speed penguins!

1602
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:07,910
Holy cow.

1603
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:33,030
Actually, CEO's tears is not bad though, so...

1604
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:34,590
Might as well grab it.

1605
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:35,210
Oh, what's this?

1606
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:36,070
Haste!

1607
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:38,390
Give me haste.

1608
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:40,290
Give me haste.

1609
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:41,870
Holy cow.

1610
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:44,010
Holy cow.

1611
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,990
Oh, it's really hard to see on this map too.

1612
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,490
Oh my god.

1613
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:53,470
It's tricky to see because of the night, you know?

1614
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:56,910
Nice start.

1615
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,430
Let's see how we go from here though.

1616
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,950
I'm gonna increase my haste.

1617
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:07,330
Haste is so...

1618
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:08,870
Having good haste...

1619
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,050
Does not waste.

1620
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,830
Oh my god.

1621
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:15,790
A good haste does not waste.

1622
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:16,750
Oh, knockback.

1623
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:17,310
I'll take that.

1624
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,480
Lightning kills, beware.

1625
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,560
Oh, thank you.

1626
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:29,740
I'll try to remember to dash.

1627
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,860
This is like the...

1628
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:33,000
This is the true like...

1629
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,900
Dash killer.

1630
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:36,920
They're like, if you don't dash...

1631
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,160
You ain't gonna make it.

1632
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,400
What is...

1633
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,580
Why is it glowing here?

1634
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:41,900
What is this?

1635
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,940
Oh, it's just like spotlights.

1636
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:45,820
Oh, it's Metal Gear.

1637
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:55,610
See?

1638
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:56,430
See?

1639
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,710
Just like that.

1640
01:32:58,650 --> 01:32:59,630
Holy moly.

1641
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:00,970
Oh my god.

1642
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:04,130
You know what?

1643
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:05,910
Actually...

1644
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:07,330
That worked.

1645
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:09,810
You know what?

1646
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,290
You know what?

1647
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:13,110
It worked.

1648
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:14,430
It worked.

1649
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:15,390
It worked.

1650
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:20,250
Not my proudest moment.

1651
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:22,230
It's so hard for me to hit control.

1652
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,650
I should just rebind it.

1653
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,850
It's just so hard for me to hit...

1654
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:29,970
Control.

1655
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:36,620
I don't...

1656
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,040
I'm just...

1657
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,560
I think I haven't done so though.

1658
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,700
Because I just don't know what to rebind it to.

1659
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,320
You know what I mean?

1660
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:42,280
I've been like...

1661
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:45,520
I don't know what would be a good...

1662
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,840
New key.

1663
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,360
Oh, wow, I ran right in that.

1664
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,440
Oh, hello.

1665
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:57,760
Get more tears.

1666
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,260
More tears.

1667
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:07,350
Guys, I got a new keyboard recently.

1668
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:10,250
And it's very...

1669
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,670
I don't mind the keyboard I have now.

1670
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:14,350
I only... Oh, nice.

1671
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:15,610
Spider clicking.

1672
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,390
I don't mind the keyboard that I have now.

1673
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:19,830
But...

1674
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:21,310
I just wanted...

1675
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:22,750
I wanted one...

1676
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:23,890
I wanted like a 70...

1677
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:25,610
I think it's 75%...

1678
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,690
The one that has the numpad.

1679
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:30,810
How thock is it?

1680
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:32,410
It's very thocky.

1681
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:33,990
It's very like...

1682
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:37,270
Also, the one I have now just doesn't sound very nice.

1683
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:42,170
So I wanted a numpad.

1684
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:43,530
It's not full size though.

1685
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:44,990
With numpad is 90...

1686
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:46,170
Oh, it's 96%.

1687
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:48,530
It's not 100%.

1688
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,910
Controller goes hard.

1689
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:57,450
People have been telling me to do with controller, but...

1690
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,050
I guess we increase our...

1691
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:05,350
You know what?

1692
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:06,390
Increase speed.

1693
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:07,810
Love that.

1694
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,330
You know what?

1695
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:08,670
Yes.

1696
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,070
Increase speed.

1697
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:11,310
You know what?

1698
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:12,030
Actually a win.

1699
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:15,510
Otherwise, I was gonna be a little sad, but...

1700
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:17,090
Yes!

1701
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,650
More speed!

1702
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,910
Speed, speed, speed, speed!

1703
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:23,030
More funds.

1704
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:23,870
I don't really need them.

1705
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:24,670
I need the...

1706
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:25,070
Oh my goodness.

1707
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:28,390
Oops.

1708
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,170
I ate that.

1709
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:30,970
I ate that.

1710
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,880
This remix?

1711
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:42,960
This remix slaps.

1712
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,580
It's so good.

1713
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,300
What was it?

1714
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:09,470
Game is really trying to kill me.

1715
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:13,690
It's like that's how the game goes or something.

1716
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:16,530
It's like the game is intentionally trying to kill you.

1717
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:19,650
It's like that's how you play the game or something.

1718
01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:21,370
That'd be... It's craziness.

1719
01:36:24,970 --> 01:36:26,670
We ball, we ball, we ball.

1720
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:30,690
I know I probably should be focusing on spider cooking, but it's fine.

1721
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,070
Maybe.

1722
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:34,210
Maybe it's fine.

1723
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:36,010
Oh my gosh.

1724
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:45,680
Somehow we absolutely lucked out of that.

1725
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:46,760
Holy cow!

1726
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,540
Somehow we absolutely lucked out of that.

1727
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:54,580
Mint to be!

1728
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,140
Thanks for the five gifted.

1729
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,360
Thank you.

1730
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,000
Overshape!

1731
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:02,440
Alright, now we just need lava.

1732
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,040
Lava bucket, we're good.

1733
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,640
Oh, take that.

1734
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,800
I'm scared.

1735
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,620
I'm scared.

1736
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,240
The boss is gonna be...

1737
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,620
Increase speed.

1738
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,220
Should we also try for rap dog again?

1739
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:40,080
Should we also try for rap dog?

1740
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,640
Because we have idle song right here.

1741
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:48,630
Hi Mint.

1742
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,390
Hi Sammy.

1743
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:51,150
Thanks for the eight points.

1744
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:53,150
Rap dog good.

1745
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:54,870
Rap dog!

1746
01:37:57,190 --> 01:38:00,170
Not to be confused with rack dog.

1747
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,190
Rack.

1748
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:05,990
Nice.

1749
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:50,320
If I die, it'll be the saddest.

1750
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,660
It'll be absolutely...

1751
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,700
Oh no, I can't die.

1752
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,120
No, no, no.

1753
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,480
There's too much pressure you guys.

1754
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,880
There's too much pressure.

1755
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:02,580
I'm scared.

1756
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:04,820
No.

1757
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:07,720
Don't jinx it.

1758
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,020
Try it.

1759
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,800
There's too much pressure.

1760
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:18,800
Are these guys gonna charge me?

1761
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,260
Nurse's horn!

1762
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:23,160
Yeah, I'm gonna take it.

1763
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,000
Anything for heal.

1764
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,320
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

1765
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,040
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

1766
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:35,540
No pressure.

1767
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,060
No pressure.

1768
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:39,340
Under pressure.

1769
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:44,680
But we're fast, we're strong.

1770
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,080
We're girl bossing.

1771
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,280
We got balls!

1772
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:51,140
More...

1773
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,260
More balls.

1774
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,700
I'm gonna focus on my balls, because...

1775
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,700
I feel that...

1776
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,700
I feel that...

1777
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:08,200
We have the CEO tears.

1778
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:11,240
But I need more anvils.

1779
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:12,840
We're strong!

1780
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:17,790
The anvil.

1781
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,090
We need to enchant.

1782
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:24,620
That one fell fast.

1783
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,080
Critical.

1784
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,400
I'm gonna go into...

1785
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,420
Hmm.

1786
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:36,540
Is she ready for maths?

1787
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:37,600
No, I'm not.

1788
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,220
I'm not ready for maths.

1789
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:45,330
Swap crowbar?

1790
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:45,970
Wait, really?

1791
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:48,090
I love having...

1792
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:49,650
Having knockback, though.

1793
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:51,290
I feel like knockback is so great.

1794
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:54,150
Right?

1795
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:02,980
I love having knockback.

1796
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,760
And then you get knockback from...

1797
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:05,800
From this.

1798
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,880
From the spider cooking.

1799
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,400
Enhance haste.

1800
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,240
Enhance.

1801
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:20,620
You say one guide, but I was more than one.

1802
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,140
Should I get a body pillow?

1803
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,760
I'm gonna hold body pillow.

1804
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:26,940
Just in case I change my mind.

1805
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,260
Crit over knockback, but my knockback is not...

1806
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,680
Or my crit is not so much anyway.

1807
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,880
Could be higher.

1808
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,580
I guess it would be higher if I use that.

1809
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,460
But look at how good knockback is.

1810
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,020
Oh my goodness.

1811
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:07,040
Because Fauna doesn't do direct damage, knockback doesn't do much with her.

1812
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:14,390
Stamps only apply to the main weapon.

1813
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:15,190
You're right.

1814
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:21,270
But I've been knocking them... Maybe I've been knocking them back because of other stuff, though.

1815
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,340
It does work, just not great.

1816
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,660
That's the spider cooking knockback.

1817
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,780
No, I don't think it has knockback yet.

1818
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:38,840
It's only level 2.

1819
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,880
I don't think it has it, right?

1820
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,500
I can't remember.

1821
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,660
Idle costume!

1822
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:49,720
Idle costume!

1823
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:57,930
Merry Christmas, Minto.

1824
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:58,650
Merry Christmas!

1825
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:06,950
For now it's OK.

1826
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,050
Good thing we got the speed.

1827
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:15,810
Good thing we are speedy.

1828
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:20,770
I wish I could get some anvils up in here, please.

1829
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:22,250
Spiders...

1830
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:24,590
Look how slow they are.

1831
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,610
Oh my gosh.

1832
01:43:30,650 --> 01:43:32,910
I dove right into it.

1833
01:43:32,930 --> 01:43:33,670
So messed up.

1834
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:45,640
Oh my god.

1835
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,820
Negative 6?

1836
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,960
Are you serious?

1837
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:50,940
Oh my god.

1838
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:52,520
Oh god!

1839
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:53,260
15?

1840
01:43:57,290 --> 01:43:58,670
I messed up.

1841
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:00,150
Oh my god!

1842
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:02,170
I don't know.

1843
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:02,910
I don't know.

1844
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:03,970
I don't know.

1845
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:04,810
I don't know.

1846
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,030
I don't know.

1847
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:06,910
I don't know.

1848
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:07,790
She's dead.

1849
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:08,750
We did it.

1850
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,140
I'm safe under my tree.

1851
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:23,100
I don't want to use that yet.

1852
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,800
Give me a regular anvil.

1853
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:26,160
Damn it.

1854
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:28,300
Give me a regular anvil!

1855
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,840
You cheapskates!

1856
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,000
They don't give you enough time!

1857
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:39,380
Don't figure that out!

1858
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,840
That's the only time you have to do it though, right?

1859
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,340
Oh my gosh.

1860
01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:00,330
Lisa, Lisa.

1861
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:02,630
I'm holding onto Lisa forever.

1862
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,410
Maybe I switch her out with the knockback.

1863
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:10,110
Oh my goodness.

1864
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:14,550
What did I just...Oh, another stamp.

1865
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:19,880
Oh, slow.

1866
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:20,000
Slow.

1867
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,300
There's the raven feather again.

1868
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,460
Slow is good here.

1869
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:34,140
You know what?

1870
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:37,000
That's true because everything is so fast.

1871
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,820
Everything is so fast.

1872
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,500
Too late for feather?

1873
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:50,580
We still have half the time, but...

1874
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,160
Plate is good.

1875
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:54,440
My speed though...

1876
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,760
I don't think it would be good here.

1877
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,420
You have to be really fast here.

1878
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,860
Though you do reduce damage taken.

1879
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,170
You'll need the extra lives.

1880
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,520
I'm going with this.

1881
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:25,660
I have no confidence.

1882
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:26,360
Swap.

1883
01:46:35,370 --> 01:46:36,310
Oh, nice.

1884
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:42,410
One day, I'll get an anvil.

1885
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:43,890
A regular old anvil.

1886
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:46,570
A regular Joe anvil.

1887
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:47,770
Someday.

1888
01:46:48,430 --> 01:46:48,910
Someday.

1889
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,290
One day.

1890
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:51,090
Maybe.

1891
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:52,730
One day I'll get an anvil.

1892
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:54,510
Just a regular old anvil.

1893
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,130
One day.

1894
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,670
Just a regular guy.

1895
01:46:58,930 --> 01:47:00,950
Just a guy that says, I'm just a regular anvil.

1896
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:05,310
I just want to enchant my stuff, but...

1897
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,350
At this rate, I'm feeling...

1898
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:14,030
Losing confidence, because I have no collabs at all.

1899
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:15,910
I'm lonely.

1900
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:17,730
I have no collabs.

1901
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:21,210
Lonely, lonely.

1902
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:23,990
I am so lonely.

1903
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:29,810
I have nobody to call my own.

1904
01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:40,010
Nice.

1905
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,310
Just talk to people forehead.

1906
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:54,670
Scary, scary, scary, scary.

1907
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:57,110
The scariest thing you could ever suggest to me.

1908
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,500
Oh, they got the bombs.

1909
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,360
I feel like that was more spots than usual.

1910
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,820
More lightning spots than usual.

1911
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,340
Oh, a strawberry.

1912
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,360
Oh my gosh.

1913
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,600
I'm never gonna get an anvil at this point.

1914
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,720
I just want...

1915
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,660
I have nothing enchanted at all.

1916
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,320
This sucks.

1917
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,180
Reroll?

1918
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:34,220
No, for anvil?

1919
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,220
I think I'm...

1920
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:40,960
I still have a bunch of stuff to level up, so...

1921
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,260
Oh my goodness.

1922
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,000
Screw it.

1923
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:55,840
Oh.

1924
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:02,340
Oh god, I just have to be careful when my tree goes away.

1925
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,620
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1926
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,180
No, no, no, no, no.

1927
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:06,860
Oh god.

1928
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,630
Let's focus on...

1929
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:16,230
Nice.

1930
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:16,990
One down.

1931
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:22,410
Okay, I'm gonna try to focus on...

1932
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:22,830
Oh my god.

1933
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:23,330
Oh my god.

1934
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:24,170
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1935
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,120
I was trying to say Ollie.

1936
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,980
I think I might just have to take it, you guys.

1937
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,200
Special is OP.

1938
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,400
Does it look like I can use my special right now?

1939
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,360
Does it look like I can use my special right now?

1940
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:57,580
No.

1941
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:00,960
Okay, so...

1942
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,080
Did VTuber use her ult yet?

1943
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,520
I think if you used your eyes, you would know.

1944
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:08,360
Anyway.

1945
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,720
Check in the bottom left for when the tree despawns.

1946
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:13,360
Really?

1947
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,280
It shows that up there?

1948
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,240
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1949
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:16,740
Alright.

1950
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:18,540
We're just gonna take it.

1951
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,040
Exapotato!

1952
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:29,790
Okay.

1953
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:31,830
Second down, second down, second down.

1954
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:37,290
Oh my gosh, Ollie, please.

1955
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:38,330
Three down!

1956
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:39,730
Nice, nice, nice.

1957
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:41,890
We're looking good, we're looking good.

1958
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:50,380
Okay, okay, okay.

1959
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:58,780
Love the concert this weekend.

1960
01:50:59,100 --> 01:50:59,980
Thank you!

1961
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:01,860
The next song was perfect.

1962
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:04,600
Our road trip playlist was idle music and lonely island.

1963
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:06,940
The perfect combo, huh?

1964
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:08,720
Oh my goodness.

1965
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:08,800
Oh my gosh.

1966
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:13,820
Nice.

1967
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,320
Okay.

1968
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:17,560
Stamps all of a sudden.

1969
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,920
Stamps, stamps, stamps.

1970
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:20,820
Hold on.

1971
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:23,560
Let me grab my earnings, please.

1972
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,260
Let's grab our winnings first.

1973
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:28,240
There was lava?

1974
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:31,700
Oopsie.

1975
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:35,660
You know what?

1976
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,240
I was so...

1977
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,140
I was so...

1978
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:41,020
One brand.

1979
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:46,340
Oops.

1980
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,500
I missed the bucket.

1981
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:48,900
Oops.

1982
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:51,660
Oopsie.

1983
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:53,080
My bad.

1984
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,560
What is this one again?

1985
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:58,140
Oh, stun enemy.

1986
01:51:58,440 --> 01:51:59,580
We'll just strike.

1987
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:00,780
My attack.

1988
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,060
Let's be stronger.

1989
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:03,600
Strong.

1990
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:04,280
Strength.

1991
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:05,760
Actually...

1992
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,350
If I up my size though...

1993
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,500
My balls will be huge.

1994
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,620
They'll be all over the screen.

1995
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:19,770
They'll be...

1996
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:20,790
They'll cover the whole screen.

1997
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:22,570
Cool bar, cool bar.

1998
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:25,950
Oh, it's just for main weapon.

1999
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:27,190
You're right.

2000
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,080
I wish I could get the double healing.

2001
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,360
You know?

2002
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,680
Okay, I'm gonna re-roll.

2003
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:55,940
And I'm gonna re-roll.

2004
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,380
I'm gonna re-roll.

2005
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,300
Re-roll.

2006
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:03,180
I'm gonna re-roll.

2007
01:53:04,700 --> 01:53:05,600
There it is!

2008
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,210
I got...

2009
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:11,240
Are we good?

2010
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:18,410
Bucket.

2011
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:20,740
You almost re-roll.

2012
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:21,360
I really did.

2013
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:25,100
I think...

2014
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,360
It disconnected for a second.

2015
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:29,880
Where can I...

2016
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:30,620
Flower.

2017
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,440
Whatever.

2018
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:35,240
I'm strong.

2019
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:35,840
I'm strong.

2020
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:36,420
I'm strong.

2021
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:37,020
I'm strong.

2022
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:41,740
I'm strong.

2023
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:42,360
I'm strong.

2024
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:45,980
Strength and...

2025
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:46,720
Strength.

2026
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:48,200
Strength and...

2027
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:49,520
And myself.

2028
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:50,720
Oh, no, no, no.

2029
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:52,280
Oh, no.

2030
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,440
You guys, I never...

2031
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,780
I still haven't gotten a single anvil.

2032
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,540
It's kind of insane.

2033
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:09,380
What's up with that?

2034
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:12,260
Game is rigged.

2035
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:13,280
Maybe.

2036
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,840
Against me.

2037
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,420
It's rigged against me.

2038
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:19,140
You got two super items.

2039
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:20,340
It's rigged!

2040
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,120
It's rigged!

2041
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:39,010
Boom, boom, boom.

2042
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:40,370
Boom, boom, boom.

2043
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:41,730
Boom, boom, boom.

2044
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:43,130
Boom, boom, boom.

2045
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:46,010
Boom, boom, boom.

2046
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,790
Leave me alone!

2047
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:48,610
Oh, my God.

2048
01:54:48,810 --> 01:54:49,650
Look at all of them.

2049
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:54,270
Lava.

2050
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:57,550
And we're almost to level 50, so this is perfect.

2051
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,570
Cinderella!

2052
01:55:09,790 --> 01:55:11,710
Pick up my...

2053
01:55:12,490 --> 01:55:13,670
Spoils of war.

2054
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:16,650
Pick up all my earnings.

2055
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:18,570
Oh, don't charge at me.

2056
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:20,730
Don't do it.

2057
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:21,710
Where did you go?

2058
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:22,550
Where did you go?

2059
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:23,630
Oh, goodness.

2060
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,270
They die so easily.

2061
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:31,310
See, I'm too good.

2062
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:34,570
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

2063
01:55:37,050 --> 01:55:38,090
Kuwabara, Kuwabara.

2064
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:45,000
If I die to the lightning...

2065
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:47,840
It'll just be a Metal Gear reference, okay?

2066
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:50,920
Guys, I would have totally done it on purpose.

2067
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:53,700
Oh, skill.

2068
01:55:57,140 --> 01:55:58,500
Haki-doki!

2069
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:00,500
Just in time.

2070
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:01,180
Perfect.

2071
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:05,180
Just in time for...

2072
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,880
Us to hit level 50.

2073
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:09,740
What just...

2074
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:14,660
Wait, what's...

2075
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:15,640
Oh, gold anvil.

2076
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,860
Hello?

2077
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:21,960
Excuse me.

2078
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:22,420
Thank you.

2079
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,180
I don't think we're ever getting an anvil, you guys.

2080
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,700
So, it's just...

2081
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:28,160
It's fine.

2082
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:32,320
Just watched your concert, Minto.

2083
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:32,860
I cried a lot.

2084
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:33,560
Amazing job!

2085
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,020
It seems like you had so much fun.

2086
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,460
We did have so much fun!

2087
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,240
Thank you.

2088
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:38,240
Don't cry.

2089
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,220
Why are you crying?

2090
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:43,040
Why are you crying?

2091
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:45,980
Don't cry.

2092
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:05,620
Oh, wait.

2093
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:11,260
We're fine.

2094
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:12,900
Oh, what do I do with this guy?

2095
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:15,500
The size stamp.

2096
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,380
I don't... Just sell it, I guess?

2097
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:21,100
I don't need it, I suppose.

2098
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:29,000
Sell it.

2099
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:29,760
Save it.

2100
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,940
What do I save it for?

2101
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,360
Oh, I guess for like...

2102
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,700
If I get a different stamp.

2103
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:39,120
I don't know what collab I want to do next.

2104
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,020
I love having...

2105
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,640
Balls all over the place.

2106
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:47,920
And we'll have the songs all over the place.

2107
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:51,860
Then we'll... I don't know.

2108
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,380
Have something else all over the place.

2109
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,440
I got stuck on the...

2110
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,380
I got stuck on the statue base!

2111
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:02,940
Oh my goodness.

2112
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:04,100
Scary.

2113
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:04,240
Scary.

2114
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:13,100
You kidding me right now?

2115
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:16,380
Whammy water and glow stick?

2116
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:17,980
That's a good one.

2117
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:24,060
You didn't get the references since you're new.

2118
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:28,860
I feel like we didn't have so many references, but...

2119
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:31,620
Thank you for still going, Schwartz, even though you're newer.

2120
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:32,860
Thank you.

2121
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:36,540
I don't think we tried to be like...

2122
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:39,640
Like...

2123
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:41,860
You must know...

2124
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,600
Doki or Minto to understand this.

2125
01:58:48,740 --> 01:58:50,340
Is it with you and balls today?

2126
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,640
Because I have the balls right here!

2127
01:58:53,060 --> 01:58:53,960
The ring of fitness!

2128
01:59:00,530 --> 01:59:02,250
Must be a ten year fan.

2129
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:08,230
It was genuinely fun regardless.

2130
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:09,610
Thank you.

2131
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:11,330
Enchant.

2132
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:17,540
Increase size.

2133
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:21,700
Where

2134
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,700
were you guys?

2135
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,060
So messed up.

2136
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:37,140
That's the way the cookie crumbles, everybody.

2137
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,040
Two in a row, even.

2138
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,800
Alright, give me my gold anvil, please.

2139
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:48,340
Thank you.

2140
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:53,280
Wait, I think...

2141
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:54,320
And we got the hammer!

2142
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,660
Give me my other gold anvil, please.

2143
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,220
Give me all my...

2144
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:04,440
Wait, give it to me.

2145
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:05,800
Give me.

2146
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:06,540
Give me.

2147
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:07,620
Please.

2148
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,060
Please, onegai.

2149
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:11,040
Onegai shimasu.

2150
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,320
I'm asking so nicely.

2151
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:14,480
Really?

2152
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,400
Nope.

2153
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:18,360
What?

2154
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:20,400
Are you kidding?

2155
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,280
Oh wait, it's over here?

2156
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:28,120
Why another one?

2157
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:32,000
Oh my gosh.

2158
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,260
You guys...

2159
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:44,840
What happened?

2160
02:00:52,470 --> 02:00:53,770
That was... What happened?

2161
02:00:56,030 --> 02:00:57,170
The headphones?

2162
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:58,190
You know what?

2163
02:00:58,330 --> 02:00:59,510
Yeah, let's go for it.

2164
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:01,590
Oh my god.

2165
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:11,090
Oh gosh, that scared me.

2166
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:16,200
The fan letter.

2167
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:16,620
Nice.

2168
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,300
More headphones.

2169
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:22,160
Nice.

2170
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:32,140
How... Let's see.

2171
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:36,400
Trying to figure out...

2172
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:39,880
Trying to figure out...

2173
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:40,980
So we're doing... What was it?

2174
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:42,400
Whammy water and...

2175
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,420
What was the other...

2176
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:46,100
Can't remember.

2177
02:01:51,910 --> 02:01:52,490
Glow stick.

2178
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:56,400
Yeah.

2179
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:00,360
We'll freeze these guys up, baby.

2180
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:05,160
As long as I gotta get the whammy water first, but you know.

2181
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,300
It'll come.

2182
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,260
My luck is just that...

2183
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,760
That stupendous.

2184
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:12,580
You know.

2185
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,980
You know, we'll get it.

2186
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:20,640
I believe.

2187
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:21,380
Oh goodness.

2188
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:31,770
Glow stick.

2189
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:34,110
In less than three minutes.

2190
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:35,150
Exactly.

2191
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:37,910
Exactly.

2192
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:15,740
I think I just ate the danmaku.

2193
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,100
Yummy.

2194
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,160
Yummy danmaku.

2195
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:29,040
Ascend here.

2196
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,700
And I just...

2197
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:36,360
Kill!

2198
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:42,090
We kill.

2199
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,980
Just hang out with them.

2200
02:03:53,140 --> 02:03:53,860
Yeah, exactly.

2201
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,900
Just like, hey buddy.

2202
02:03:58,640 --> 02:03:59,420
Oh my gosh.

2203
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:00,400
So much on the screen.

2204
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:03,420
My eyes.

2205
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,280
But now we don't have a...

2206
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:10,280
We don't have our ult.

2207
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:11,940
So we have to be very careful.

2208
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:13,860
We don't have our ult to rely upon.

2209
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:16,120
Oh, there's a stamp there.

2210
02:04:16,420 --> 02:04:17,000
Second stamp.

2211
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:18,240
Right stamp.

2212
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,480
Everything is maxed out.

2213
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:23,300
Goodbye.

2214
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,520
Which one is this one again?

2215
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:26,200
I can't remember.

2216
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:29,080
Adds one additional shot to ranged multi-shot weapons.

2217
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:31,760
This is ranged.

2218
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:32,320
Technic.

2219
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:33,260
Does this count?

2220
02:04:38,850 --> 02:04:39,950
More leaves.

2221
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:43,490
What do I get rid of maybe?

2222
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:45,530
But my attack...

2223
02:04:46,410 --> 02:04:47,610
My damage is 25.

2224
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:50,230
More leaves.

2225
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:51,290
Okay, we'll swap.

2226
02:04:56,570 --> 02:04:57,630
More leaves.

2227
02:05:02,210 --> 02:05:03,130
Wait a minute, water!

2228
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:05,650
I told you guys we'd get it.

2229
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:10,230
With one minute left to spare.

2230
02:05:17,530 --> 02:05:20,330
I thought, I'm not gonna lie, I thought that was a monkey.

2231
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:26,880
I'm afraid of what the boss is gonna be.

2232
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:31,220
At least nobody is charging at me yet.

2233
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:34,820
Nice, nice, nice.

2234
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:35,960
They fall, they fall!

2235
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:40,540
They all fall!

2236
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:44,720
You should be afraid.

2237
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:54,330
The music doesn't help at all.

2238
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:56,190
It makes me feel so intense.

2239
02:05:57,070 --> 02:05:58,750
Makes me feel so intense.

2240
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:04,290
Oh, hi Green.

2241
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:05,170
Goodbye.

2242
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:06,990
Oh, wait, is this max?

2243
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:07,730
Oh, just kidding.

2244
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:08,470
Goodbye, Green.

2245
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:14,230
We have a piggy bank.

2246
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:16,290
Actually, I'm making really good gold.

2247
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:17,770
For all things considered.

2248
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:21,570
Making pretty good gold for all things considered, right?

2249
02:06:25,510 --> 02:06:27,170
Alright, here it comes!

2250
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:31,030
3, 2, 1!

2251
02:06:31,970 --> 02:06:32,390
Boss!

2252
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:53,700
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

2253
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,200
So far so good.

2254
02:07:00,930 --> 02:07:01,710
Where did she go?

2255
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:07,130
Why the hell are you all the way up there?

2256
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,050
Oh, you know what?

2257
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:08,530
This is fine.

2258
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:10,670
I'm chilling in here.

2259
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:17,330
Oh my gosh, there she is.

2260
02:07:21,230 --> 02:07:21,630
Banana!

2261
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,670
It moves, it moves, it moves, it moves, it moves, it moves.

2262
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,590
Holy cow.

2263
02:07:31,950 --> 02:07:32,390
Oh gosh.

2264
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:34,830
Ma'am!

2265
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,600
Oh, bananas!

2266
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:43,460
Oh, bananas!

2267
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:02,000
Can't believe we first tried both!

2268
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:07,030
First tried both!

2269
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:08,410
Yippee!

2270
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:13,070
Final sweep!

2271
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:21,840
Mintos Gaming.

2272
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:30,120
Back down, shoutout!

2273
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:30,900
Thank you for the...

2274
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:35,470
I know, now I can breathe.

2275
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:40,530
Holy moly.

2276
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:42,030
Very thanks for the tag gifted!

2277
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:46,370
Oh, where did it go?

2278
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:53,350
All of them.

2279
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:01,010
First try even.

2280
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:02,610
Minky fought monkey.

2281
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:04,670
I got the monkey.

2282
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:07,710
I can't believe we did both.

2283
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:09,090
First try!

2284
02:09:11,250 --> 02:09:12,610
Kiwawa, OP.

2285
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:14,290
Fauna, OP.

2286
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:16,450
Minto, OP.

2287
02:09:18,650 --> 02:09:20,350
Mayoshi is so good at video games.

2288
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:25,530
Now what?

2289
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:27,470
To the slots?

2290
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:30,870
Let's take all our winnings!

2291
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:33,370
And throw it to the wind!

2292
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:37,110
Elfriede, thank you for the tag gifted!

2293
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:38,070
Thank you!

2294
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:43,760
I have a question.

2295
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:49,820
I have a question.

2296
02:09:51,220 --> 02:09:54,680
I try to buy more USA chips with my money, but it won't let me.

2297
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,260
Why not?

2298
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:01,380
I hope I said your name right!

2299
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:02,900
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted!

2300
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:04,440
Thank you!

2301
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:06,280
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2302
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,520
1000 is the cap?

2303
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:14,160
Why?

2304
02:10:17,220 --> 02:10:17,740
Why?

2305
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:19,940
Why can't I...

2306
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:22,680
This is not pay to win?

2307
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:28,740
Is this not pay to win?

2308
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:42,810
Auto-click the slots.

2309
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:44,090
I do have an auto-clicker.

2310
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:50,560
It's kind of fast though, because I use it for...

2311
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:53,560
I use it for...

2312
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:56,480
Let's see how fast can we go.

2313
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:08,000
I just casually got the jackpot!

2314
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,600
Use it for what?

2315
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:13,480
Cookie clicker!

2316
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:21,870
Guys?

2317
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:28,390
Wait, but what about when it's time for the mini-game?

2318
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:34,630
Oh, it's kind of working.

2319
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:37,910
Finish!

2320
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:42,690
What's happening today with Minto's luck?

2321
02:11:43,570 --> 02:11:46,170
My afterlife is turning around, baby!

2322
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:49,110
It's all...

2323
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:50,570
Minto from here!

2324
02:11:55,010 --> 02:11:57,150
It's all Minto from here!

2325
02:11:58,150 --> 02:12:00,650
Which could be either uphill or downhill.

2326
02:12:02,110 --> 02:12:04,130
No one can really say, huh?

2327
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:08,470
It's all coming up, Minto!

2328
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:13,310
Aw, dang it.

2329
02:12:14,670 --> 02:12:16,090
We're at 22,000.

2330
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:18,030
You guys, we might be able to get a monkey today.

2331
02:12:22,110 --> 02:12:24,650
Thank you guys for helping me out during the...

2332
02:12:26,610 --> 02:12:27,570
During the...

2333
02:12:27,570 --> 02:12:29,050
The stages.

2334
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:30,510
I really appreciate it.

2335
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:31,910
Thank you guys.

2336
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:33,430
Minky, Minky, Minky.

2337
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:35,210
We're gonna buy a Minky.

2338
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:37,310
Minky, Minky, Minky.

2339
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:40,170
We're gonna get a headgun Minky!

2340
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:41,810
Thanks for the superchat!

2341
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:48,340
Anytime, Mint.

2342
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:49,600
Our pleasure.

2343
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:54,500
Oh my god.

2344
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:57,720
I didn't see you.

2345
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:59,480
I didn't see you there.

2346
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:01,560
My arch nemesis.

2347
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:09,320
I wouldn't recommend the monkey.

2348
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:09,960
Why not?

2349
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:11,300
Does it smell?

2350
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:12,120
Does it poop?

2351
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,080
Is it terrible?

2352
02:13:19,360 --> 02:13:20,100
1,000!

2353
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:22,920
I think that's my highest yet.

2354
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:28,010
It might poop.

2355
02:13:28,430 --> 02:13:29,450
It actually poops?

2356
02:13:29,650 --> 02:13:30,350
Does it fling poop?

2357
02:13:30,710 --> 02:13:32,950
My mom, when she was a kid, she had a monkey.

2358
02:13:34,430 --> 02:13:36,650
And my grandpa got it for her.

2359
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:38,450
So her dad...

2360
02:13:38,450 --> 02:13:39,630
My grandpa got it for her.

2361
02:13:39,770 --> 02:13:40,190
No wait.

2362
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:41,710
That's a lie.

2363
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:43,090
My grandma got it for her.

2364
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:48,510
And then one day my grandpa came home and the monkey flinged poop at his face.

2365
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:51,490
And he was like, get this monkey out of here!

2366
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:57,790
The monkey threw the poop at his face.

2367
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:05,730
I guess it doesn't really surprise anybody though that my grandma would get my mom a monkey.

2368
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:15,140
So like, I don't...

2369
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:18,520
I don't know how long she had it for.

2370
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:25,340
Classic grandma move.

2371
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:30,350
Hi!

2372
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:31,610
Thanks for 80 months!

2373
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:32,910
Deep monkey poop lore.

2374
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:33,830
Wait, hold on.

2375
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:37,910
I didn't get to read your super chat, Brian.

2376
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:39,050
Crab battle.

2377
02:14:40,070 --> 02:14:41,010
Crab battle.

2378
02:14:42,770 --> 02:14:44,630
Did that prepare her to raise you?

2379
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:46,310
My mom?

2380
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:48,810
I don't know.

2381
02:14:49,870 --> 02:14:53,010
How does your grandma even know where to source a monkey for pets?

2382
02:14:53,470 --> 02:14:56,210
Well, I mean, that was when my mom was a kid, so...

2383
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,910
You know, it was a long time ago, right?

2384
02:15:02,230 --> 02:15:05,210
I bet you could just go down the street and find a monkey.

2385
02:15:06,730 --> 02:15:07,130
Probably.

2386
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:11,770
There's an achievement for getting all of the math on hard level 4 right.

2387
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:13,250
So there's that.

2388
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:16,270
Oh no, but I want to get all the achievements in the game!

2389
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:25,200
Don't let that distract you from the fact that...

2390
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,970
Grandma Minto bought a fucking monkey.

2391
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:35,630
Does it work if you pause?

2392
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:37,230
I don't know.

2393
02:15:38,290 --> 02:15:38,950
Good question.

2394
02:15:40,310 --> 02:15:42,070
Your stream is like the happy toucan.

2395
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:44,170
Thanks, Evan!

2396
02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:46,630
I love your toucan profile picture.

2397
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:47,750
Jackpot!

2398
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:51,690
Surge, thanks for a month!

2399
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:53,150
Message field too short.

2400
02:15:53,410 --> 02:15:53,850
Minto cute.

2401
02:15:59,330 --> 02:16:01,170
You can pause, really?

2402
02:16:01,970 --> 02:16:03,690
You guys, how much is it for the monkey?

2403
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:05,730
Is it 50,000 like the rest?

2404
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:07,710
Because we're over halfway there.

2405
02:16:13,850 --> 02:16:14,470
K.U.

2406
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:17,430
is planning on moving tower achievements so it doesn't count towards 100%.

2407
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:23,290
Yeah, I remember him mentioning that he was gonna make some other achievements that don't count towards 100%.

2408
02:16:23,290 --> 02:16:25,630
But for everybody who wants to...

2409
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:27,310
Torture themselves.

2410
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:32,270
It's... What?

2411
02:16:32,770 --> 02:16:34,310
It's 111K!

2412
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:42,060
You guys, we were at 29.

2413
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:45,960
Uh...

2414
02:17:00,470 --> 02:17:01,030
I...

2415
02:17:02,770 --> 02:17:05,910
I wanna do the tower, but...

2416
02:17:07,550 --> 02:17:09,670
I just don't like Jump King.

2417
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:14,730
I don't like Jump King even a little bit.

2418
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:19,010
Cool stuff at 300K, so consider subscribing, guys.

2419
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:20,970
Thank you guys for getting me to 299!

2420
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:22,730
I appreciate it.

2421
02:17:28,380 --> 02:17:30,460
Took me 4 hours.

2422
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:32,760
I know, like, I don't...

2423
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:35,500
I want to read Grandma Minto's autobiography.

2424
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:41,760
My sister has been, like, recording her every time...

2425
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:43,520
I see her.

2426
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:48,940
Did you see the girl wisp at AWA wearing a perfect wig of your hair?

2427
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:49,540
It was very cute.

2428
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:50,760
No!

2429
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:53,320
I didn't!

2430
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:55,660
Though I did see, there was one booth...

2431
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:58,640
I think it was in the Artist Alley that had a Minto Dolphy.

2432
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:00,840
They had a Doki Dolphy too, but...

2433
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:01,280
It's crazy.

2434
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:02,380
Joey, thanks for the gifted!

2435
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:05,360
I saw a hotdog Minto.

2436
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:07,260
I saw a hotdog Minto!

2437
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:10,080
I did see that one.

2438
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:10,820
So cute.

2439
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:12,900
So, so cute.

2440
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:14,260
I'm new.

2441
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:14,720
Hi, hi.

2442
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:15,360
Hi, hi!

2443
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:16,780
Welcome, welcome!

2444
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:21,980
Hotdog.

2445
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:24,020
That's a real hotdog moment.

2446
02:18:28,290 --> 02:18:30,130
Consider slowing the framerate down.

2447
02:18:30,210 --> 02:18:31,490
It makes the tower a lot easier.

2448
02:18:32,630 --> 02:18:34,110
Is that the hacks?

2449
02:18:34,970 --> 02:18:36,210
Hotdog, I'm hungry.

2450
02:18:40,730 --> 02:18:43,370
There were corn dogs at the convention.

2451
02:18:45,050 --> 02:18:46,190
But I didn't get any.

2452
02:18:46,510 --> 02:18:47,970
Instead, I got tater tots.

2453
02:18:48,470 --> 02:18:51,250
And then, my friends made fun of me for getting tater tots.

2454
02:18:51,390 --> 02:18:53,790
But they were some dang good tater tots.

2455
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:56,350
I was like, wow.

2456
02:18:56,830 --> 02:18:58,710
These are actually really tasty.

2457
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,440
Sit in line for the concert near hotdog Minto.

2458
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:07,600
She got a lot of compliments.

2459
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:10,420
So happy.

2460
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:11,440
I'm really glad.

2461
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:14,020
I was really worried that it was gonna be super duper cold.

2462
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:17,700
Because of people... And also raining.

2463
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:20,600
People having to wait outside for the concert.

2464
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:22,680
I was really, really nervous about that.

2465
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,380
I was like, oh no.

2466
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:25,560
Are people gonna have to either wait out in the rain?

2467
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:27,680
Luckily, it rained on Sunday instead.

2468
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:31,800
But I was worried people would have to wait in the rain.

2469
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:34,920
Or wait in the super cold.

2470
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:38,320
So I was like, whew.

2471
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:41,140
It wasn't such bad weather.

2472
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:46,220
The weather was really nice, thankfully, for the concert.

2473
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,680
I'm kind of Ameonna.

2474
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:52,240
Ameonna is like...

2475
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,400
It's kind of in the name.

2476
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,420
It's rain woman.

2477
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:00,660
So, usually for events and things that I want to do, it's raining.

2478
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:03,320
But...

2479
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:04,640
Yeah, I'm a rain woman.

2480
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:05,720
A rain bringer.

2481
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:09,580
But...

2482
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:10,620
There was a movie about it.

2483
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:11,060
So true!

2484
02:20:12,820 --> 02:20:13,820
Tenki no ko.

2485
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:17,400
Ame otoko here.

2486
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:19,100
Yeah...

2487
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,400
But...

2488
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:23,800
Yeah, so I'm really happy.

2489
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:25,240
It wasn't like that.

2490
02:20:25,940 --> 02:20:26,340
Rinze!

2491
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:27,860
Thanks for 8 votes!

2492
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:30,080
It was really cool.

2493
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:32,520
We could pick up our Happis at the con so we could wear them at the concert.

2494
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:33,140
Right!

2495
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:35,440
I was so happy that...

2496
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:37,600
Yeah, Lights was able to make that work out, honestly.

2497
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:39,400
I was so like...

2498
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:41,660
Jackpot!

2499
02:20:41,660 --> 02:20:41,860
Jackpot!

2500
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:47,920
I was so nervous about...

2501
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:52,040
But they worked really hard to be able to get them in time for the concert.

2502
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:54,780
So, were you happy about it?

2503
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:55,940
Yeah!

2504
02:20:57,160 --> 02:20:58,840
Happy, happy, happy!

2505
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:02,880
I'm still waiting on mine.

2506
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:05,940
I believe they said that orders were going to be shipped out this week.

2507
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:09,940
But also account for, you know, slow...

2508
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,720
Slower shipping because of the holidays.

2509
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:15,820
So...

2510
02:21:18,630 --> 02:21:20,850
Hope you were able to see my Ace Combat figure.

2511
02:21:20,970 --> 02:21:21,310
I did!

2512
02:21:21,430 --> 02:21:22,130
I saw it!

2513
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:23,710
I liked your tweet!

2514
02:21:27,790 --> 02:21:28,870
Just peeking in.

2515
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:29,650
Hi, Liquid!

2516
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:36,000
They just tweeted out the boxes to be shipped.

2517
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:37,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2518
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:39,280
So...

2519
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:46,060
If you pre-ordered a Happy...

2520
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:47,180
Which, there were so many boxes.

2521
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,780
I did not expect so many people to order some.

2522
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:53,440
I was like, wow, that's a lot of boxes.

2523
02:21:55,420 --> 02:21:58,360
But it was really exciting to see people wearing them.

2524
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:01,780
I was like, wow, this is my own Happy.

2525
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:03,660
This is my own...

2526
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:05,740
My own designed Happy Coat.

2527
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:06,820
I was so happy.

2528
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:08,620
I was happy about the Happy.

2529
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:15,660
Need to get a Happy and a good pen light for the next concert.

2530
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:16,480
Yeah!

2531
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:18,780
Asukusu!

2532
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:19,960
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

2533
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:22,600
If you want a good pen light...

2534
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:25,060
Anything Lumica...

2535
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:26,920
Lumica being the brand...

2536
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:27,900
Is a good quality.

2537
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:32,980
I really like the Lumica ones because they make them pretty easy to use.

2538
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:36,640
Not just because I'm biased.

2539
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:40,840
Lumica.

2540
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:42,020
Lumi... with a C.

2541
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:44,060
C-A.

2542
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:44,740
Lumica.

2543
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:47,960
People like you and want me to merge, dummy.

2544
02:22:58,450 --> 02:23:00,030
I still have my Love Live pen lights.

2545
02:23:00,130 --> 02:23:01,070
Yeah, those work too!

2546
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:02,950
Yeah.

2547
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:09,590
You don't have to have the pen light of the thing you're watching.

2548
02:23:09,730 --> 02:23:10,610
Don't worry about it.

2549
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:14,950
Don't feel like you're like, oh, I have to have a pen light for...

2550
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:17,950
If I go see Minto, I can't use a Hololive pen light.

2551
02:23:18,250 --> 02:23:19,170
No, no, no, no, no.

2552
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:21,650
No, no, no, no, no.

2553
02:23:22,310 --> 02:23:23,170
Go for it.

2554
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:24,230
Don't worry about it.

2555
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:29,430
I'm super happy to finally have some official merch and stuff to wear and represent you.

2556
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:30,570
Thank you!

2557
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:42,360
Is the Allies gonna make more of the Happy?

2558
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:46,540
There were no plans to.

2559
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:50,680
There were no plans to.

2560
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:52,600
I did have people asking.

2561
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:55,710
And we thought about extending the date, but...

2562
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:01,820
If I do make more in the future, there'll probably be like a different design.

2563
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,040
So don't think like those are the only Happy that will ever be released.

2564
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:09,100
Really like how the Phantom Thief pen light has the colors in order.

2565
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:10,840
Makes it easier to swap between you and Doki.

2566
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:11,940
Really?

2567
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:14,020
Let's go, Lumica.

2568
02:24:18,150 --> 02:24:18,570
Wait.

2569
02:24:21,310 --> 02:24:23,090
We're at 42,000, you guys.

2570
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:24,010
We're killing it.

2571
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:31,640
Make a Minto 3.0 Happy.

2572
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:32,900
Stop.

2573
02:24:33,020 --> 02:24:33,460
Ruin it.

2574
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:33,780
Stop.

2575
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,380
Stop guessing my plans.

2576
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:39,820
Are lightsabers allowed?

2577
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:41,980
Yeah, probably.

2578
02:24:42,380 --> 02:24:43,940
Just don't hit anybody in the head.

2579
02:24:44,140 --> 02:24:44,880
Just don't bonk it.

2580
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,700
I wanna say something.

2581
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:47,560
Ozzy!

2582
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:49,300
It's going to be my birthday soon.

2583
02:24:50,340 --> 02:24:51,960
I'll sing you early happy birthday.

2584
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,820
Happy birthday to you.

2585
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:58,620
Happy birthday to you.

2586
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:02,940
Happy birthday, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.

2587
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:07,880
Happy birthday to you.

2588
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:19,030
If you... So there's these things called UOs, if you're not sure what they are.

2589
02:25:19,130 --> 02:25:20,870
They're the pen lights that when you...

2590
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:22,130
Not pen lights, sorry.

2591
02:25:22,130 --> 02:25:23,930
They're like glow sticks when you crack them.

2592
02:25:24,030 --> 02:25:25,050
They're super duper bright.

2593
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:32,870
They're very popular in otage and people using them to like guruguru cyclone at concerts and things like that.

2594
02:25:32,970 --> 02:25:35,930
Idol lives and anisong lives and things like that.

2595
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:39,470
If you break those...

2596
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:44,270
When you throw them, it's called stardusting, actually.

2597
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:47,830
Please do not do that.

2598
02:25:49,210 --> 02:25:52,530
It's so funny because I considered adding a song to my setlist.

2599
02:25:52,650 --> 02:25:54,410
It's called Yoake Brand New Days.

2600
02:25:54,810 --> 02:25:57,350
Which is the origin of Yet Tiger, actually.

2601
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:08,010
At the end of the song, everybody throws their UOs up into the air.

2602
02:26:08,010 --> 02:26:10,040
But I thought it might be a little bit of a...

2603
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:13,010
Of a niche song...

2604
02:26:15,450 --> 02:26:17,770
To have as in my setlist.

2605
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:20,750
UOs are needed for Snow Halation.

2606
02:26:20,930 --> 02:26:21,970
Exactly, exactly.

2607
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,690
But...

2608
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:28,010
Yeah, I think that's like the only acceptable way of using...

2609
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:31,230
Of throwing your UOs.

2610
02:26:31,370 --> 02:26:36,130
Otherwise, please don't throw them at people, at the screens, everything like that.

2611
02:26:36,130 --> 02:26:37,330
Like...

2612
02:26:38,270 --> 02:26:43,250
There's already been a couple tweets about it, but especially if you're throwing them...

2613
02:26:43,250 --> 02:26:49,550
At the screens or you accidentally hit somebody in the head and things like that.

2614
02:26:50,310 --> 02:26:52,290
Just don't throw them, please.

2615
02:26:52,890 --> 02:26:58,090
I know sometimes you're going crazy and you accidentally slip from your hand.

2616
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:01,130
That's understandable, but...

2617
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:03,790
You know, yeah.

2618
02:27:04,250 --> 02:27:09,450
Someone threw one during... Some people threw them several times during the concert, unfortunately.

2619
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:13,030
So, yeah.

2620
02:27:14,090 --> 02:27:16,290
Kind of think of it as like how...

2621
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:22,170
Like people throwing things at actual artists during concerts and stuff.

2622
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:27,650
Like people will throw things at like Billie Eilish and, you know, things like that.

2623
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:28,530
It's just like...

2624
02:27:31,130 --> 02:27:33,130
I don't know why this...

2625
02:27:34,470 --> 02:27:38,690
I know it's always been a thing, but I don't know why it's grown to be so much of a bigger thing recently.

2626
02:27:39,430 --> 02:27:39,950
But...

2627
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:45,190
We love when everybody is yakai, but we don't love when things are damaged, you know?

2628
02:27:46,750 --> 02:27:47,270
So...

2629
02:27:47,270 --> 02:27:50,330
We love when you are yakai having fun.

2630
02:27:51,050 --> 02:27:53,530
But imagine if it had like, you know...

2631
02:27:53,530 --> 02:27:58,330
Hit the screen and caused like a little dead pixel area or something.

2632
02:27:58,330 --> 02:28:01,170
Then it would have ruined the experience for everyone.

2633
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:10,980
Yakai responsibly.

2634
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:12,820
Prune, welcome to Mabushu!

2635
02:28:13,980 --> 02:28:14,700
Thank you.

2636
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:16,020
Thank you so much.

2637
02:28:16,100 --> 02:28:16,560
Welcome, welcome!

2638
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:18,860
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2639
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:20,580
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2640
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,160
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

2641
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:24,840
Yeah, I just wanted to say that.

2642
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:26,320
I just wanted to make sure I...

2643
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:27,680
Put like a...

2644
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:30,000
I guess a public statement out about that.

2645
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:32,980
Especially because I, you know...

2646
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:35,980
I feel that I...

2647
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:40,020
How do I say?

2648
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:45,140
I feel I am responsible a little bit.

2649
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:47,680
Because it was my concert.

2650
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:50,940
Hello, Mito-kun.

2651
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:51,380
Hello!

2652
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:52,700
Wahoo!

2653
02:28:52,780 --> 02:28:53,660
Old Snake!

2654
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:56,820
Iceman!

2655
02:28:57,240 --> 02:28:58,460
Great profile picture.

2656
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:01,220
No throwing lightsabers?

2657
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:02,680
I don't even...

2658
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:04,560
Would you even want to...

2659
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:07,900
Would you even want to ruin your...

2660
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:09,960
Like, potentially damage your lightsaber?

2661
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:10,880
That would be so sad.

2662
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,460
Mito invented Yakai.

2663
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:25,380
Guys, we are at 53.

2664
02:29:34,620 --> 02:29:36,520
Wait, there is holocoin prizes?

2665
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:40,000
1, 2, 3...

2666
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:41,260
Wait.

2667
02:29:41,540 --> 02:29:44,520
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

2668
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:46,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

2669
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:48,340
No!

2670
02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:49,560
It's so expensive!

2671
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:50,440
What?

2672
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:52,020
Maybe I do need the money.

2673
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:52,480
Chris!

2674
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:53,700
Welcome to bamboo ship!

2675
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:54,420
Thank you!

2676
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:55,240
Anip!

2677
02:29:55,480 --> 02:29:56,460
Thank you for the 50 gift!

2678
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:57,000
Thank you!

2679
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:59,240
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

2680
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:03,840
I can buy the drink.

2681
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,120
A somewhat tasty drink.

2682
02:30:06,220 --> 02:30:07,620
This item does absolutely nothing.

2683
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:08,940
It is an absolute scam.

2684
02:30:08,940 --> 02:30:11,180
You will only waste your chips from buying this.

2685
02:30:16,030 --> 02:30:17,510
But I can buy it.

2686
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:30,460
But I can buy it.

2687
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:31,960
Yeah, what if it's not a scam?

2688
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:40,100
What if it's... What if they're just being, you know, a little playful about it?

2689
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,180
They're like, it's definitely a scam!

2690
02:31:12,220 --> 02:31:14,500
I thought it would, like, say sold out.

2691
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:20,160
But they allow you the option to even buy it again.

2692
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:33,650
Look up?

2693
02:31:34,250 --> 02:31:34,750
What?

2694
02:31:35,030 --> 02:31:36,110
What did I do?

2695
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:36,610
What's up?

2696
02:31:36,950 --> 02:31:37,970
What's up?

2697
02:31:49,480 --> 02:31:50,200
That...

2698
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:50,700
Yeah.

2699
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:56,820
If you buy 1,000, you unlock Mew.

2700
02:31:58,140 --> 02:32:03,740
And then, you buy 1,000, then you look under the Pekora statue.

2701
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:06,860
And that's where you'll find Mew.

2702
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:17,120
Monkey!

2703
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:20,020
Wait, I kinda want the beetle.

2704
02:32:29,020 --> 02:32:31,440
You need to play as Kanata and push the statue.

2705
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,220
But Minky...

2706
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:37,040
You're right.

2707
02:32:38,020 --> 02:32:38,700
You're right.

2708
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:40,340
Don't lose sight of the goal.

2709
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:41,100
Okay, you're right.

2710
02:32:41,500 --> 02:32:42,400
You guys are right.

2711
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:43,420
I'm gonna leave.

2712
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:44,220
I'm gonna close out.

2713
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:44,940
I'm gonna get out of here.

2714
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:48,600
My workers are exhausted.

2715
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:53,380
So is that a scam or a hustle?

2716
02:33:08,060 --> 02:33:09,460
I think we did good.

2717
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:16,180
It was a flex of wealth.

2718
02:33:17,740 --> 02:33:20,880
It's like when somebody goes and gets the ice cream with the gold...

2719
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:23,740
With the gold flakes on it, you know?

2720
02:33:24,400 --> 02:33:26,100
It doesn't taste any better.

2721
02:33:26,660 --> 02:33:27,740
It's just like...

2722
02:33:48,660 --> 02:33:51,540
I've had hot cocoa with gold flakes.

2723
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:52,640
Not worth it.

2724
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:56,380
I've had that.

2725
02:33:56,500 --> 02:33:57,620
I did feel fancy.

2726
02:33:58,480 --> 02:33:58,860
I bet.

2727
02:33:59,820 --> 02:34:00,900
I've never tried it before.

2728
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:02,880
Anything with the gold flakes.

2729
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:09,320
I've never had anything with the gold flakes.

2730
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:11,580
Decreed us for...

2731
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,320
Have some dignity, Chaz!

2732
02:34:13,700 --> 02:34:14,220
Please!

2733
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:18,000
Can you do the Ojo-sama laugh?

2734
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:19,480
Let me practice.

2735
02:34:25,890 --> 02:34:27,530
I don't think I can do it very well.

2736
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:28,530
But I'll try.

2737
02:34:28,530 --> 02:34:28,690
I'll try.

2738
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:39,060
I'm not the Ojo-sama.

2739
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:40,260
I'm just a maid.

2740
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:46,480
I'm just a maid.

2741
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:50,740
I'm not worthy.

2742
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:53,120
Korone comes from the woods.

2743
02:34:54,540 --> 02:34:55,480
There she goes.

2744
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:56,780
Away from the woods.

2745
02:34:58,760 --> 02:35:00,820
There she goes back into the woods.

2746
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:03,080
Oh my gosh, there she is!

2747
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,420
There's Mew behind the bush!

2748
02:35:05,720 --> 02:35:07,360
There's Mew behind the bush!

2749
02:35:10,220 --> 02:35:11,470
If you catch Korone...

2750
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:18,200
Oh my gosh, that would be kind of crazy if there was like a secret thing where it's just like you talk to...

2751
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:19,460
Oh, and there goes Mew.

2752
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:22,080
You talk to somebody...

2753
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:23,200
You talk to...

2754
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:26,660
You talk to Kanata three times...

2755
02:35:26,660 --> 02:35:29,500
And spin around...

2756
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,180
And then...

2757
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:33,180
You talk to...

2758
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,160
Then you...

2759
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:36,640
Then you...

2760
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:38,280
When you...

2761
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:38,940
Wait, no.

2762
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:41,980
You then run to...

2763
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:42,740
The tower.

2764
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:45,380
Knock on the door three times.

2765
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:48,580
And then you also...

2766
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:52,280
You mine five...

2767
02:35:52,280 --> 02:35:54,640
Five diamond rocks.

2768
02:35:54,980 --> 02:35:57,480
And then you...

2769
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:00,640
Unlock another...

2770
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:02,080
Usada drink.

2771
02:36:22,220 --> 02:36:23,980
Can you say that again?

2772
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:24,900
I missed it.

2773
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:28,480
Write that down.

2774
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:31,880
All that for water.

2775
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:34,860
Hey, it's a doggy dog world out there.

2776
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:35,700
Water's not free.

2777
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:41,740
I thought a playable Yago.

2778
02:36:42,280 --> 02:36:44,180
No, that's too...

2779
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:46,200
Someone's in this decay.

2780
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:54,900
Free stuff.

2781
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:56,780
This is my favorite part.

2782
02:37:10,860 --> 02:37:12,220
More free stuff.

2783
02:37:19,780 --> 02:37:21,800
Well guys, we did it.

2784
02:37:22,020 --> 02:37:23,660
Stage three, stage four.

2785
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,680
I'm gonna change the title.

2786
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:29,380
It says stage three hard, stage four hard...

2787
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:30,320
Tutorial.

2788
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:33,660
How to beat stage three, stage four.

2789
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:34,460
First try.

2790
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:36,780
Tutorial.

2791
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:39,940
Tutorial.

2792
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:40,840
First try.

2793
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:45,440
We're so good.

2794
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:46,920
We're gamers, everybody.

2795
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:49,420
Tutorial.

2796
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:50,020
Walkthrough.

2797
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:56,440
Fauna sweep.

2798
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:57,520
Fauna sweep!

2799
02:37:57,620 --> 02:38:02,160
I'm so glad that last time I could use Kiwawa to get through the stages I wanted to.

2800
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:06,420
And then this time I used Fauna to get through the stages I wanted to.

2801
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:07,880
Using my Oshis...

2802
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:12,300
Using my Oshis to beat the stages is the best feeling ever.

2803
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:17,040
She makes it look easy.

2804
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:25,340
One day kid...

2805
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:28,160
One day kid, you can be on my level.

2806
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:33,460
Can't wait till...

2807
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:34,600
No, I don't want to be...

2808
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:37,640
No, I don't...

2809
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:39,440
You know...

2810
02:38:40,740 --> 02:38:44,180
I feel bad when people are just like...

2811
02:38:44,180 --> 02:38:44,780
Win...

2812
02:38:45,940 --> 02:38:47,840
You know, indie...

2813
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:52,360
Friend DLC or win friend DLC and stuff like that, but...

2814
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:55,620
I don't know, I feel like it's adding too much pressure to...

2815
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:57,380
You know, it's holo cure, everybody.

2816
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:00,280
It's holo cure.

2817
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:02,920
I'm perfectly fine with it remaining that way.

2818
02:39:08,820 --> 02:39:09,380
So...

2819
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:10,500
Don't worry about it.

2820
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:12,420
Walk through, pick Fauna, exactly.

2821
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:17,660
Holo is holo, exactly.

2822
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:21,760
And I very much love being a fan of hololive.

2823
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:24,520
Dope.

2824
02:39:28,530 --> 02:39:28,870
Yeah!

2825
02:39:29,410 --> 02:39:31,430
Congrats on the successful concert, Minto!

2826
02:39:31,770 --> 02:39:32,430
Thanks, Nami!

2827
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:36,010
Hope you get plenty of rest when you can.

2828
02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:37,010
Thank you!

2829
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:39,970
She hates K.U.

2830
02:39:40,230 --> 02:39:41,350
Yeah, I hate that guy!

2831
02:39:43,710 --> 02:39:44,390
It's okay.

2832
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:45,650
The feeling is mutual.

2833
02:39:46,350 --> 02:39:48,410
It's a... It's a hate-hate.

2834
02:39:48,990 --> 02:39:49,270
You know?

2835
02:39:50,650 --> 02:39:51,590
Can't wait for Furumako.

2836
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:52,530
I know!

2837
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:55,190
I can't wait.

2838
02:39:57,110 --> 02:40:00,050
But now there's...

2839
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:03,070
Advent and Justice that they have to add.

2840
02:40:05,010 --> 02:40:07,570
So... And all the other JPs.

2841
02:40:10,030 --> 02:40:13,230
Too much... Too many women.

2842
02:40:14,690 --> 02:40:18,110
Can you tell us how to unlock holo from spice and move in the game?

2843
02:40:19,510 --> 02:40:22,190
You talk to Kanata three times.

2844
02:40:22,270 --> 02:40:22,570
Remember?

2845
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:24,910
One... Oh, I'm fishing.

2846
02:40:25,490 --> 02:40:26,410
Get me out of here!

2847
02:40:26,690 --> 02:40:27,370
I don't want to fish!

2848
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:35,860
Talk...

2849
02:40:35,860 --> 02:40:36,540
What?

2850
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:39,060
What?!

2851
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:48,620
What did I just catch?

2852
02:40:56,770 --> 02:40:58,930
How do I have ten axolotls?

2853
02:41:00,710 --> 02:41:01,930
What did I just get?

2854
02:41:02,990 --> 02:41:03,550
But

2855
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:19,920
I've gotten the turtle before!

2856
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:32,970
The golden koi is from before.

2857
02:41:34,910 --> 02:41:36,750
It wasn't the golden koi.

2858
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:38,270
I got that off stream, actually.

2859
02:41:38,410 --> 02:41:38,730
Sorry.

2860
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:49,540
I'm... I... I

2861
02:42:04,540 --> 02:42:06,700
think it must have been an axolotl.

2862
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:09,340
Or something, because...

2863
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,180
I've never actually caught an axolotl on my...

2864
02:42:15,980 --> 02:42:17,140
On my...

2865
02:42:17,960 --> 02:42:18,920
In here.

2866
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,760
I've only gotten it through the stages.

2867
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:28,690
I'm so...

2868
02:42:30,970 --> 02:42:32,390
Check the tapes later.

2869
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:34,370
Yeah, I have to watch the VOD.

2870
02:42:34,630 --> 02:42:36,470
Which means, I have to go!

2871
02:42:38,030 --> 02:42:39,190
Thank you guys!

2872
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:41,610
What a crazy way to end the stream!

2873
02:42:42,430 --> 02:42:45,570
I... My mind is blown right now!

2874
02:42:45,850 --> 02:42:50,130
I've been trying to get that achievement for so long!

2875
02:42:50,830 --> 02:42:52,250
And I just got it!

2876
02:42:52,870 --> 02:42:54,430
On a one-off chance!

2877
02:42:54,850 --> 02:42:56,610
I am... I am absolutely...

2878
02:43:01,330 --> 02:43:03,470
I can't believe it!

2879
02:43:04,210 --> 02:43:05,930
I absolutely...

2880
02:43:07,610 --> 02:43:10,310
Thank you so much, you guys, for the stream!

2881
02:43:10,950 --> 02:43:13,010
Say Kanata three times!

2882
02:43:13,110 --> 02:43:15,450
Talk to Kanata three times, everybody!

2883
02:43:15,770 --> 02:43:16,370
It works!

2884
02:43:16,650 --> 02:43:17,630
Every time!

2885
02:43:18,370 --> 02:43:18,930
Otsuminto!

2886
02:43:19,190 --> 02:43:20,970
Have a great rest of your day or your night!

2887
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:22,610
And I'll see you guys next time!

2888
02:43:22,730 --> 02:43:24,550
Thank you guys!

2889
02:43:25,110 --> 02:43:25,910
Bye-bye!
