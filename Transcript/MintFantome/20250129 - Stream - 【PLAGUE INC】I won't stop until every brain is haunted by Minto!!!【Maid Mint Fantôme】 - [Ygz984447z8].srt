1
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,030
Sorry, the mic... threw off my groove.

2
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,750
Hi!

3
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,540
Can I finish my banana real quick?

4
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,700
What if I said something else?

5
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,220
Everybody eat banana, it's good for potassium.

6
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,100
Banana at 7pm?

7
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,560
Is that bad?

8
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,420
Is this how I won't stop copying?

9
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,180
How do you know I'm not having yours?

10
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:27,640
I didn't know I didn't just have... I didn't just possess your mind and your body and eat your banana and took it.

11
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,900
Now I'm eating it.

12
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Da!

13
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,100
Stole the banana, exactly.

14
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:50,880
I think it thinks that the banana peel is 6.7% Hold on

15
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:12,590
I just ate a rotten part of the banana I just bought this banana I wasn't looking and I ate into it No!

16
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,990
Hold on, let me read some of the superchats As they are coming in, thank you for the superchats!

17
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,150
Thank you!

18
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,290
I was watching your Miisai VOD and would like to volunteer to be your GF.

19
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,010
I will cook, not jump scare you.

20
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,790
Let you do all the haunting.

21
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,830
I need a little bit of a jump scare.

22
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,530
Brown and soft is still fine.

23
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,270
That's what you make pudding with.

24
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,130
Really?

25
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,950
Wait, it's okay then?

26
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,230
I'll be well today.

27
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,670
I used to play this game on my phone a lot.

28
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,730
I am good.

29
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,310
I also used to play it on my phone.

30
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,390
Taxman is coming.

31
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,590
Oh gosh, don't remind me.

32
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,430
I don't even want to think about it.

33
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,090
Banana?

34
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,150
Mr. Bandai, thank you for the 20 Gifted.

35
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,370
Help me with your nanomachines.

36
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,030
I will.

37
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,010
And Ducky, thanks for the Gifted.

38
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,230
Okay.

39
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,270
Mintophilioma.

40
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,450
Use code Boomer.

41
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,430
Andrew, thanks for the 20 Gifted.

42
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,650
Thank you!

43
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,130
Actually, today has been like... my brain is not working today.

44
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,570
I had an appointment.

45
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,750
And I put it in my calendar for 3 PM.

46
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,250
Sorry, 3.30 PM.

47
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,430
But it was actually 3 PM.

48
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,670
So I was 30 minutes late.

49
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,030
And then I got there.

50
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,750
And they were like...

51
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,670
It was like... I say an appointment.

52
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,050
It was a facial.

53
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,150
I make it sound so official.

54
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,730
No, it was just...

55
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,050
But then they were like...

56
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,470
Do you have any medicines?

57
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,930
And I was like... No.

58
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,390
And then I was like... Wait a second.

59
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,370
Yes.

60
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,170
And I was like...

61
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,430
I was like...

62
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,330
I have the medicine.

63
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,270
I've been taking the medicine.

64
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,470
And so then I couldn't even get the thing that I had my appointment for.

65
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,890
And I was...

66
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,390
It ended up taking what should have been like a 30 minute appointment.

67
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,510
It took 2 hours.

68
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,950
My brain is not working today.

69
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,650
But that's okay.

70
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,670
Because all we have to do is infect the world.

71
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,470
What are we going to do tonight, Minto?

72
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,230
The same thing we do every night.

73
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,630
We try to take over the world.

74
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,630
We tried after ink from the same devs.

75
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,530
Not the cure one, right?

76
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,550
Is that something else?

77
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,890
I haven't actually.

78
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,530
Wait a second.

79
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,050
Minky and the brain.

80
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,650
Wait a second.

81
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,830
That's implying that I'm not the brain.

82
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,310
Wait, wait, wait.

83
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,710
No, no, no, no.

84
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,050
Change the...

85
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,410
Change the lyrics.

86
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,230
No, no, no.

87
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,650
Change the lyrics.

88
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,770
Minky has a brain.

89
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,550
Minky is the brain.

90
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,470
She has the brain.

91
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,950
And is a little insane.

92
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,710
Canon lyrics.

93
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,970
Pinky is the emotionally intelligent one.

94
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,970
I don't know if I'm even that.

95
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,030
Too late, canon now.

96
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,710
No.

97
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,210
No.

98
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,650
Minky has something, alright.

99
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,450
What do you mean by that?

100
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,230
What do you... Can you say...

101
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,870
I think I did it too...

102
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,310
Oh, sorry.

103
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,410
Oh gosh.

104
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,810
I think I did it too well.

105
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,950
It even surprised me.

106
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,350
Oh my god.

107
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,690
Oh no...

108
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,050
I have tears in my eyes.

109
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,980
My mouth doesn't open though.

110
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,400
When I eat... It used to open.

111
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
But now when I eat food I'm like...

112
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm like a proper lady.

113
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,020
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

114
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,180
One time I accidentally drank rotten...

115
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,420
Palm green tea.

116
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,660
It was fermented and had black stuff in it.

117
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,660
I didn't notice at first because I'm used to kombucha.

118
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,020
I've never had kombucha before.

119
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,660
Johnny!

120
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,100
Happy birthday!

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,680
Happy birthday to you.

122
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,240
Happy birthday to you.

123
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,680
Happy birthday dear Johnny H.

124
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,520
Happy birthday to you.

125
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,820
Happy birthday!

126
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
Which do you guys prefer?

127
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,580
Do you guys prefer when the VTuber goes...

128
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Or do you prefer when the VTuber goes...

129
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,720
Which do you prefer?

130
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:02,780
Which do you prefer?

131
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,380
I will start chewing with my mouth open.

132
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,260
Oh gosh.

133
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,180
Can you imagine?

134
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,940
There's some habits from VTubing that I have taken off stream as well.

135
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
And I can imagine if I was just like...

136
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,220
Well, if everybody wants me to chew with my mouth open...

137
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,400
Because they like it better.

138
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,020
I feel that it would permanently change how I eat.

139
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,300
And my friends would be like...

140
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,600
Mint, you're disgusting.

141
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,640
What are you doing?

142
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,380
And I'm like... I would form such a bad habit.

143
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,860
Logan, thank you for the vibe gift.

144
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
All the time.

145
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,600
Instead.

146
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,300
Instead!

147
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,460
Sorry, chat liked it more.

148
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,180
I'm just a monkey that dances for you guys.

149
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,300
I don't have any more food.

150
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,440
Actually, that's a lie.

151
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,600
I have some candy, but I don't want candy.

152
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,140
I don't want a candy just to show you guys how I chew.

153
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Dog with peanut butter vibes.

154
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
VTuber, eat peanut butter.

155
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,320
Both are adorable?

156
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,520
Really?

157
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
You think so?

158
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,300
It's my birthday.

159
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,280
Don't ask how old.

160
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,900
But thanks for the AOE to stream yesterday.

161
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,540
Let's just say I played that game as a high schooler.

162
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,660
Happy birthday, Old Serge.

163
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Happy birthday to you.

164
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,840
Happy birthday to you.

165
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,280
Happy birthday, Old Serge.

166
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,640
Happy birthday to you.

167
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,420
Happy birthday.

168
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,280
Can you chew...

169
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,980
Can you chew me with two?

170
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,420
I want to get smothered.

171
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,210
I think it turned auto-correct off.

172
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,470
I have auto-correct turned back on.

173
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,310
And then I made a tweet about it earlier.

174
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,610
I was typing it and I typed...

175
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,510
Initially I was typing big announcement.

176
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,770
And then I typed bug.

177
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,830
And then I spelled announcement wrong.

178
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,150
I forgot an N.

179
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,150
Bug announcement.

180
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,470
Is it just me or is Minto looking extra cute today?

181
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,250
Was that the Minto virus taking over your brain?

182
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,150
What are you talking...

183
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,730
I look the same that I do everyday.

184
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,610
Oh my gosh, but...

185
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,430
I saw something today.

186
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,750
I saw something today that you guys will see eventually.

187
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,810
Actually I saw two things today.

188
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,690
That you guys will see eventually.

189
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,750
That are very...

190
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,130
Very cute.

191
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,190
Very cute, I think.

192
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,430
Minto I choose you.

193
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,170
You is a tail wag.

194
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,360
Big things coming.

196
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,680
Chewing for viewers, but we're off stream.

197
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,960
What do you mean?

198
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,270
Sorry if the BGM cuts out from the game it's because I tabbed out of the window.

199
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,250
It's one of those types of games, you know what I mean?

200
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,570
My defense, no!

201
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,750
Lower defense, lower defense, lower defense.

202
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,670
Are you guys ready to spread some brain rot?

203
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,750
All over...

204
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,010
Multiplayer?

205
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,660
It's my friend and fellow wisp's birthday today.

206
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,460
Can I get an MGS birthday for my friend Chuwu?

207
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,720
That's actually his name.

208
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,700
Wait, did I say it right then?

209
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,100
Chuwu?

210
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,220
Happy birthday!

211
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Congratulations!

212
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,180
Happy birthday!

213
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,080
Salutations!

214
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,020
Happy birthday!

215
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,140
May your scars stay blue!

216
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,160
Happy birthday Chuwu!

217
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,940
Happy birthday!

218
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,060
Yay!

219
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,580
Two plagues.

220
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,980
I imagine it's probably like a friend multiplayer.

221
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,100
I thought you could be like multiple, multiple, multiple player.

222
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,800
Let's do the main game.

223
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,180
Play.

224
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,900
I think I remember how to play this.

225
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,540
The following new plague type has been discovered and unlocked.

226
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
Shadow Plague.

227
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,520
In single player.

228
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,920
I was at MAGFest over the weekend and there were so many wisps and sold out mint fan art.

229
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,220
Gamers love mint.

230
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,880
I didn't even know MAGFest was happening and then I saw that it was happening and I was like...

231
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,420
I feel FOMO.

232
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,860
I was like...

233
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
Oh yeah, Matara was there.

234
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,440
Thank god I didn't go.

235
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,200
It was so funny.

236
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,080
She sent me a picture of her with a snake cosplay.

237
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,460
She was like, look I found him.

238
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,320
I was like, that's my man!

239
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,580
And then she went, no, it's my man.

240
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,040
And sent me another picture of her doing heart hands with him.

241
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,940
I was like, you planned this.

242
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,440
She doesn't even know him.

243
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,440
It's Naked Snake.

244
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,320
I was like, what the hell?

245
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,360
How dare you plan this?

246
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,280
How dare you?

247
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:40,920
How dare?

248
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,740
Am I so predictable that she would knew I say, it's my little man.

249
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,040
And then she...

250
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,780
I hate this.

251
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,010
I did.

252
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,370
I did get fiddled.

253
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,950
I did get played like a damn fiddle.

254
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,970
Snake would never love me anyway.

255
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,790
I don't think he would love Matara either, not gonna lie.

256
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,610
He would be...

257
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:23,350
I mean, maybe he would be attracted to her looks and then she'd open her mouth and never shut it.

258
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,370
And he'd be like, okay, nevermind.

259
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,510
I think he'd... I can imagine her just being yap, yap, yapping away.

260
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,610
And he's just like...

261
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,690
Like trying to sleep.

262
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,210
You know like a montage of someone who just never shuts up.

263
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:47,750
And he's like, he's like rolling over in bed trying to cover his ears with his pillow and she's just non-stop yapping.

264
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,830
I'm gonna play the game alongside you and see if your strategy will help me win as well.

265
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,050
You got to re-infect her with the brain rot.

266
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,950
I know, she has to finish.

267
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,990
I hosted a minto watch party at MAG, it was super fun.

268
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,850
Wait, I saw the picture!

269
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,670
Why didn't you invite me?

270
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,970
TFT on.

271
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,370
You're gonna host a minto party and not even invite me?

272
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,250
Hekate, thanks for 9 months!

273
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,990
Thank you!

274
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,530
I didn't know they had mint in this game.

275
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,990
Would you go?

276
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,250
Yeah, I'd haunt.

277
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,090
I would like be there in spirit.

278
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,890
They were busy streaming.

279
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,830
Fine, everybody gets to go and have fun and you know, hang out.

280
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,230
And I'll... I'll play Plague Inc.

281
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,670
Ha, I get it.

282
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,910
I'm so... I'm so... I'm a fungus.

283
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,670
Or you could say I'm a fungi.

284
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,290
Where's the vampire?

285
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,950
We could be a monkey!

286
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,330
Or we could be a vampire.

287
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,250
Sentient.

288
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:23,830
Mutant.

289
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,670
I remember trying this one before.

290
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,890
The Shadow Plague is actually really difficult.

291
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,610
Because...

292
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,590
It's hard.

293
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,620
It's kind of complicated.

294
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,060
I don't know the strats for it.

295
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,700
How hard?

296
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,500
If you hard, then you hard.

297
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,740
Shadow Plague.

298
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,160
Exactly.

299
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,040
Just like that.

300
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,400
Maybe we just... Let's take it slow.

301
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,360
Let's take it slow with the bacteria.

302
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,540
Oh gosh.

303
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,200
Okay, we got to get the genes in.

304
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,020
Oh, I don't have any genes.

305
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,580
Everything's locked.

306
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,880
We must unlock the things first.

307
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,400
We have zero genes unlocked.

308
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,680
Let's do it.

309
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,520
We'll do normal.

310
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,640
67.3% of people wash hands.

311
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,540
Doctors work three days a week.

312
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,220
That's it.

313
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,640
Sick people ignore.

314
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,760
Ignore.

315
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,000
That's so mean.

316
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,500
No apple bottom jeans.

317
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,600
No boots with the fur.

318
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,020
Hope my favorite ghost maid is doing well today.

319
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,420
I am.

320
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,180
Thanks, Amanda.

321
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,940
Okay.

322
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,000
Let the sick people be ignored.

323
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,480
Actually, I'm sick and I'm ignored.

324
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,760
I'm sick with Metal Gear Brain Rot.

325
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,820
Wait, cheats?

326
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,920
Dang.

327
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,740
No cheats allowed.

328
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,860
Let's name it.

329
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,660
The Brain Rot.

330
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,200
This is not your average virus, everybody.

331
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,760
This is literally the Metal Gear Brain Rot.

332
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,880
This is literally the Metal Gear.

333
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,240
I go into your home and I say, Metal Gear, Metal Gear, Metal Gear.

334
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,020
And then you become terminal with the Metal Gear Brain Rot.

335
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,580
We aren't ignoring you.

336
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,880
There's just no treatment.

337
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,180
You guys, last night... I have a confession.

338
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,820
Well, this has happened before, but it also happened last night and that's why it's fresh in my brain.

339
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,420
Some nights I can't sleep.

340
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,980
You'll see me that I'm on Twitter maybe at like 2 AM EST.

341
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,120
3 AM EST.

342
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,160
And last night was one of those nights.

343
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,600
I actually wasn't on Twitter, though.

344
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,660
And those nights, those nights I can't sleep, it's because I'm literally thinking about Snake and Ocelot.

345
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,620
And last night, I was just bawling my little eyes out.

346
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,340
I was just thinking about them.

347
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,460
And thinking about how tragic their love is.

348
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,240
And thinking about how...

349
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,980
I can't.

350
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,720
Why is my OTP also not so popular?

351
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,320
Everybody likes Snake Otacon, but nobody likes Snake...

352
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
They like Venom Ocelot.

353
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,760
My OTP...

354
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,040
There's just something so beautiful.

355
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,820
It's because I'm dead, you know?

356
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,720
That's why I love a tragic love story, because everything that I would have is tragic, because I'm dead.

357
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:07,240
So I think maybe that's why I'm just like, yeah, give me that tragic love that they'll never get together.

358
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,040
You're such a lose... lose arm.

359
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,040
Says you.

360
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,160
Why'd you put that space there, huh?

361
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,860
Wait, if you put loser, does it get...

362
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,560
Does it get caught by the YouTube of gods?

363
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,540
More of a Snake Miller kind of guy.

364
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,800
That's fine too.

365
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,680
But, you know, I just love Big Boss and Otacon.

366
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,800
So, nope, just kidding.

367
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,560
Ocelot, oh gosh.

368
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,860
Now I'm thinking of Otacon.

369
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,900
You should repost more fan art of them and then maybe you'll infect us.

370
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,660
No, it's for my eyes only.

371
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,000
Sometimes love can't bloom on a battlefield.

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,600
It did!

373
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,860
No, it did!

374
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,000
I ship Ocelot, SniperWolf, like a real degenerate.

375
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,700
The brain rot.

376
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,980
Welcome to Plague Inc.

377
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,200
You are a new bacteria.

378
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,340
To win, you must evolve and spread across the world, wiping out all humans in the ultimate plague.

379
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,560
The ultimate plague of brain rot.

380
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Everybody, when you say dead, don't think of them as actually dead.

381
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,160
They are just thinking of their OTP too much.

382
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,540
And they're thinking about Metal Gear too much, you know.

383
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,260
Oh my goodness.

384
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,160
Loud BGM, sorry.

385
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,840
Dead inside.

386
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,400
No!

387
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,960
Don't dead, open inside.

388
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,140
Guys, I also have a confession today.

389
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,040
Today I played Bellatro.

390
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,120
I played more Bellatro and I died.

391
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,660
And I also played more Age of Empires.

392
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,340
Bellatro mentioned.

393
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,300
Where should we start?

394
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:29,920
Wait.

395
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,240
Alaska?

396
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,200
Can I start in Alaska?

397
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,100
Or should I start in the Russian jungles?

398
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,640
Madagascar.

399
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,580
I did that before.

400
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,980
I did that last time.

401
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,580
Greenland?

402
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,440
No, it's so... We gotta get there naturally.

403
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,440
Zanzibar.

404
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,160
Zanzibar land is not a real place.

405
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,160
Antarctica.

406
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't think you can go there.

407
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,360
Can you?

408
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,500
We can't start in Antarctica.

409
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
There's people there though.

410
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,280
They're the only safe ones.

411
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,100
It's real to me.

412
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,540
Let's start.

413
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,080
Let's start in the Russian jungles.

414
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,940
That's where the story begins, everybody.

415
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,200
That's where Metal Gear begins, in the Russian jungles.

416
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,080
It's huge!

417
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,040
Does this virus affect me if my brain is already soup?

418
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,920
I slurped it?

419
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,290
I slurped it?

420
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,630
BGM is still loud?

421
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,550
Is that butter?

422
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,350
I feel like...

423
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,890
All my settings have been off lately.

424
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,130
Yummy.

425
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:06,390
Cherry!

426
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,070
Thanks for 9 months!

427
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,390
Thank you!

428
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,110
Better?

429
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:12,970
Oh, okay.

430
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,100
Okay.

431
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,520
We're here.

432
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,520
The brain rot begins in Russia.

433
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,770
The brain rot has infected its first human.

434
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:40,570
Weak, but not... used to cold temperatures and must evolve using DNA points to invade more people.

435
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,170
Awesome life!

436
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,510
It's too good.

437
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,770
Okay, so from here is how you...

438
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,590
Oh wait, hold on.

439
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,570
How do I...

440
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,840
We have one person infected.

441
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,040
Oh, we get DNA points.

442
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,780
I think she was really looking forward to cracking up today.

443
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,020
I'm looking forward to cracking up.

444
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,180
I love that video.

445
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,620
I haven't cracked up in a while.

446
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,780
I'm really looking forward to cracking up.

447
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,580
Stop it!

448
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,660
Let's see.

449
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,340
Maybe we have 10 points.

450
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,400
Maybe...

451
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,300
Oh, CQC!

452
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,080
CQC...

453
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,520
is...

454
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,660
is probably the best way, right?

455
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,320
BQB.

456
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,620
Ebola.

457
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,520
I used to...

458
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,520
It took me one time reading the Hot Zone...

459
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,000
for me to become such a big fan of Ebola.

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,960
I had a little Ebola plushie.

461
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,280
All I did was read the Hot Zone once and I was like...

462
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,880
That's my virus!

463
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,900
Fan.

464
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,620
Let's see.

465
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,480
How much...

466
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,160
Cost 8.

467
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,560
Evolve.

468
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,340
BQB.

469
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,660
You have successfully evolved the Brain Rot.

470
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,020
Fan.

471
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,660
Welcome to membership.

472
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,620
Thank you.

473
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,380
Fan of what?

474
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,360
You know, just how it is.

475
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,600
How it's so horrible.

476
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,400
You know?

477
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
How, like, you bleed everywhere.

478
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,320
How...

479
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,940
How it's just such a...

480
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,360
funky virus.

481
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,880
And it's just...

482
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
It's virus looks like a little worm.

483
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,240
You know?

484
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,880
Eating Mike Tyson's...

485
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
booty hole.

486
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,260
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

487
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,680
Thank you.

488
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,940
I'm gonna change it to something different every time.

489
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,280
Okay.

490
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,920
We're traveling.

491
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,180
We have 4 infected.

492
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
This is the slow...

493
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,760
This might be...

494
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,780
This might be a slow...

495
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:36,620
Wait.

496
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,860
A slow game.

497
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,540
But we'll get there.

498
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,140
Thanks for 7 months.

499
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:45,840
Thank you!

500
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,200
Valve time slower than thought.

501
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,880
Researchers have calculated that it takes longer than expected for radioactive fluids with a half-life of 3 years to pass through valves.

502
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,740
Reason?

503
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,640
Unknown.

504
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,740
The brain rot begins to spread.

505
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,400
Half-life 3 reference.

506
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,700
Thanks for the super chat, Lizzo!

507
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,720
Valve out, you're catching strays.

508
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,820
The brain rot begins to spread.

509
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,120
Spreading from person to person in rush hour will grow exponentially.

510
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,500
You control the plague indirectly by evolving it.

511
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,520
Nice.

512
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,800
Okay, what else can we do?

513
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,420
We can do some abilities.

514
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,700
I think abilities are probably the more important thing, right?

515
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,520
Able to withstand hot temperature and climate.

516
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,120
But we already know we can withstand cold temperature and climate because we're in...

517
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,240
We're in the...

518
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,940
The jungle.

519
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,040
You control the brain rot.

520
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,660
You control the brain rot.

521
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,180
We will get GTA 6 before half-life 3.

522
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,620
Valve has the opportunity to do the funniest thing right now.

523
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,860
They have the opportunity to do the silliest, funniest thing.

524
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,060
The jungle's in rush hour, what?

525
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
Sorry, it's Metal Gear.

526
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,780
Sorry, it's Metal Gear reference.

527
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,320
Look, look, look!

528
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,400
It's Metal Gear, it's Metal Gear.

529
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm sorry.

530
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,940
I'll shut up about Metal Gear.

531
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,720
Powering off.

532
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,860
What is that?

533
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,980
Is that a blood thing?

534
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,560
It's just anemia.

535
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,960
Blood disease.

536
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,580
Okay, okay.

537
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,120
Without the points.

538
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,460
Let's go.

539
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,860
I guess, let's see.

540
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,920
Resistant to antibiotics.

541
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,840
Shell to protect against all climates.

542
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,040
Keep on spreading.

543
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,700
To find out more about a country...

544
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,500
Oh my gosh!

545
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,160
You can zoom in, I had no idea.

546
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,780
The brain rot infects hundreds!

547
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,160
That's us, you guys.

548
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,780
That's us.

549
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,860
They can make a Half-Life 3 musical if they're brave.

550
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,380
Maybe.

551
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,720
Spreading the IE tiger virus.

552
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,720
Oh my gosh.

553
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,900
I had a dream last night that...

554
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,440
I had a dream last night that I was showing off my books.

555
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,440
And this is real.

556
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,640
This is real.

557
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,440
Like, this is what friends do when you are into otake and stuff.

558
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,000
Also, no Nelson, I'm sorry.

559
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,900
Hold on.

560
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,920
How many points do you need to get the brain rot to unlock anime VTubers?

561
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,740
And waifu figurines.

562
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,980
That's free, that's free.

563
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,940
But anyway, my dream last night.

564
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,840
I was showing off my books that my friends have gotten me.

565
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,260
Because I rearranged my room the other day.

566
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,660
And I was looking at my books and I was like...

567
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,820
Oh, my books!

568
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,060
Wait, hold on.

569
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,180
I have... Hold on, let me go get it.

570
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,660
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

571
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,220
I thought I had one more.

572
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,160
I thought I had one more.

573
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,900
But my friends...

574
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,740
My friends got me these books so many years ago.

575
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,080
And now I'm making my dream a reality.

576
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,760
My actual dream.

577
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,360
My dream that was in my head last night.

578
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,560
So my friends got me these books.

579
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,400
The first one is called Meet the Tiger.

580
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,880
It's just a book all about tigers.

581
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,280
But it's so funny that it's called Meet the Tiger.

582
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,080
Because if you don't know anything about otage.

583
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,560
Which are like the loud calling and cheers and everything.

584
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,800
Hi!

585
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,660
Hi!

586
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,240
Hi!

587
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,400
The people do like idol concerts and stuff like that.

588
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,520
There's one that's...

589
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,160
You know, there's the one mix that goes...

590
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,520
And then there's also like...

591
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,880
And then...

592
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,420
We're all just like...

593
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,160
So...

594
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,800
It's funny that it's called Meet the Tiger.

595
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,880
And then my friends also got me another book.

596
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,040
And this one's the best one.

597
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,060
I don't even know anything that it's about.

598
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,420
But it's called The Tiger in the House!

599
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,940
Oh my god!

600
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,120
It's called The Tiger...

601
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,620
The Tiger in the House is teeming with excitement.

602
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,200
And heart stirring emotion.

603
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,420
A natural storyteller.

604
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,260
Shihan will draw you in with her finely crafted characters.

605
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,000
And hold you tight until the very end.

606
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,680
So it's a literal house tiger!

607
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,080
Oh my gosh, it's so funny.

608
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,460
It's so fun...

609
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,300
I still have these.

610
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,260
I still have these because...

611
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,180
It's just...

612
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,580
You know, my friends got them for me.

613
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,940
Even though I've never read The Tiger in the House.

614
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,760
I literally only have it for the name.

615
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,060
And I have it on my bookshelf.

616
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,300
Thanks friends!

617
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,840
They don't watch my streams.

618
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,120
They don't watch my streams, but that's okay.

619
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,840
That's actually how I prefer it.

620
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,320
Kai!

621
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,500
Welcome to membership!

622
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,680
Thank you!

623
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,820
Okay.

624
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,760
The brain rot is infecting hundreds.

625
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,780
Let's go.

626
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,680
You can shut up when you're dead.

627
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,180
Wait.

628
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,740
I am dead.

629
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,500
It's been nine months, time to take responsibility.

630
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,380
Uh...

631
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah, my responsibility.

632
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,680
Alright.

633
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,600
We gotta get into other countries.

634
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,640
What's going on now?

635
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,960
What's happening now?

636
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,720
Maybe we increase the transmission.

637
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,800
From the BQB.

638
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,360
So nasty.

639
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,620
Wait, refund?

640
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,660
Oh no, this isn't.

641
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,120
My bad.

642
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,220
Fourteen.

643
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,000
Infected bodily fluids able to pass through mucous membranes.

644
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,000
Meet the tiger.

645
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,360
Team Fortress 2 theme.

646
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,360
I actually don't know Team Fortress 2.

647
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,160
Still waiting on the album.

648
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
Please Minto, don't do this.

649
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,920
I don't want to go outside.

650
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,680
What do you mean?

651
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,380
Aihara, thanks for nine months.

652
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,260
Thank you.

653
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,220
King Zero, welcome to membership.

654
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:57,940
Thank you.

655
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,720
Let's do the BQB.

656
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,920
Guys, this isn't a normal bacteria.

657
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,160
This isn't a normal virus.

658
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,820
This is literal...

659
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,680
Think of it as like...

660
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,060
It's more like a...

661
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,280
It's a mental thing.

662
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,780
It's not a physical virus.

663
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,100
It's like...

664
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,500
This is literally...

665
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,620
Can I zoom out?

666
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,020
There we go.

667
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,580
This is the Metal Gear Brain Rot taking over.

668
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,940
Boo.

669
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,980
Thanks, Gator.

670
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,300
Festival of Love?

671
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,440
Wait, Russia celebrates the Festival of Love.

672
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,580
We're going to infect so many people with the Brain Rot.

673
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,620
Fans praise the replacement for International Kissing Day.

674
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,480
A Russian twat.

675
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,480
Wait.

676
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,020
It was supposed to be a kissing day and now it's not?

677
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,120
No.

678
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,840
Our transmission.

679
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,420
Critics question hygiene standards.

680
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:01,700
Wait.

681
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,620
So they are still kissing or...

682
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,700
It's been upgraded.

683
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,920
From just kissing to more love.

684
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,840
Not just kissing.

685
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,610
Handshakes?

686
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,630
And...

687
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,010
High-fives?

688
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,570
Hand-holding?

689
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,830
I have been birthed, Minky.

690
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,430
Happy birthday, Nick.

691
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,130
Minto, alimony and child support fund.

692
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:46,950
Thank you.

693
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,130
You never told me about the other...

694
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,730
Can't believe Minto created the original Brain Rot.

695
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,090
Must be Solid Snake breakdancing.

696
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,090
Sorry, I'm trying to read Super Chats.

697
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,490
And everybody.

698
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,030
But it's hard because of the game.

699
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,150
The Brain Rot infects thousands.

700
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,970
23,000.

701
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,530
Holy moly.

702
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:16,870
We need...

703
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,170
Once we get a little bit...

704
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,050
More people...

705
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,250
You know, then...

706
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,070
Then they'll realize...

707
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,430
Or rather, then we'll get the symptoms going, you know?

708
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,490
Then we'll get the symptoms going.

709
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,470
Doing some kind of judo.

710
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,670
Love giving my wife a handshake before we go to our separate beds.

711
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,590
I hear though that having separate beds is healthy.

712
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,850
We don't have enough DNA points.

713
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,910
Baltic states have been infected!

714
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,190
New infection!

715
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,430
Are you sure realization isn't a symptom?

716
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,170
No...

717
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,810
More countries are...

718
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:13,070
How?

719
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,670
How is it?

720
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,710
Oh, it's mutating!

721
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

722
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,170
What is this?

723
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,170
What is this mutation?

724
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:19,350
Infection.

725
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,480
Let's do it also through the bugs.

726
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,820
Batara Khan plays Metal Gear.

727
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,100
Don't read...

728
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,960
Medicine in Germany slowing infection.

729
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,840
They already have a medicine?

730
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,540
No...

731
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,780
Medicine coat.

732
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,340
I have no money.

733
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,280
Medicine coat.

734
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,180
New aid program.

735
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,540
I thought it was... I thought it was... What's it called?

736
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,320
Oh my goodness.

737
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,080
How is it spreading so fast now?

738
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,020
What's happening?

739
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,460
The love festival!

740
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,440
The love festival.

741
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,160
Oh my god!

742
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,800
More infectious than TB.

743
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,380
It's a very infect... How is it?

744
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,780
How did Just Kissing do this?

745
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,900
How did Just Kissing do this to...

746
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,100
I think it just got sent to America.

747
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,500
I watched it.

748
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,600
I watched it take a boat there.

749
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,420
Ok, hold on.

750
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,160
We have the resistance.

751
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,300
And we have the resistance.

752
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,460
Nice.

753
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:49,540
Nice.

754
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,480
This is the boss's will.

755
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,640
More infectious than HIV!

756
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,240
Extremely infectious.

757
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,340
The love festival really did numbers.

758
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,660
Guys...

759
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,880
Russia almost half brain rotted.

760
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,920
I know.

761
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,260
Russia is like only thinking about Metal Gear now.

762
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,220
New minor disease spreading.

763
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,200
In a normal checkup, a doctor in Russia found a new disease.

764
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,660
This world is freaking...

765
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,500
Should we start the freak disease too next?

766
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,900
Should we start the freak disease next?

767
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,340
Which has been named the brain rot.

768
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,860
It appears...

769
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,060
To be mostly harmless but must be investigated further.

770
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,500
Other countries are also reporting this disease.

771
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,360
Japan!

772
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,940
This is the boss's will.

773
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,180
Coughing symptom!

774
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,300
Hey, hey, hey.

775
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,040
Don't get too...

776
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,220
This guy is so...

777
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,340
He is so energetic.

778
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,020
People all over the world join hands.

779
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,420
Start a love train.

780
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,300
Love train.

781
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,520
Um...

782
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,120
Inability to sleep!

783
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,380
Ok, let's get rid of coughing.

784
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,860
Give me my points.

785
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,460
Yeah, yeah, devolve and get this one instead.

786
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,120
Oh no!

787
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,440
Uh-oh.

788
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,480
Russia starts work on a cure.

789
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,560
Love festival does this?

790
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,840
We need love deterrence.

791
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,940
Peace day!

792
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,420
Hi Minto, it was my birthday last week.

793
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,840
I don't know if I can still claim a song.

794
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,180
Either way, thank you for being such a cheerful giggly presence.

795
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,380
Atamama, happy birthday!

796
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,640
Gosh, they start working on the cure so fast.

797
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,120
Happy birthday to you.

798
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,740
Happy birthday to you.

799
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,860
Happy birthday Atamama.

800
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,040
Happy birthday to you.

801
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,360
Happy birthday!

802
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,680
Ok, how do we slow the cure?

803
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,580
How do we slow the cure?

804
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,880
Ok, it's still at 0%.

805
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:28,760
Evolve!

806
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,980
Infect more.

807
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,340
Metal gear, metal gear.

808
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,620
Everybody think about metal gear.

809
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,740
Everybody is thinking about metal gear right now.

810
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,040
Almost the entire world.

811
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,340
Nobody will ever stop thinking.

812
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,180
Genetic hardening and air.

813
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,700
Oh no!

814
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,460
I hope I got it.

815
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,660
I hope I got it.

816
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,480
Hold on, let's grab...

817
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,260
We got Greenland!

818
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,840
Wait, we don't have Iceland yet though.

819
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,660
But their borders are still...

820
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,880
Dang, I thought that was going straight there.

821
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,620
Oh we got Australia!

822
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,200
But no New Zealand.

823
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,200
We have nowhere in Africa.

824
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,680
Nowhere in South America.

825
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:26,780
Madagascar?

826
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,160
No.

827
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,280
We don't want people to close their borders.

828
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,940
That's when things really start.

829
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,640
That's why you don't want the symptoms to be too craziness.

830
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,760
Oh!

831
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,740
We hit Egypt?

832
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,540
We hit Iceland!

833
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:47,880
Cysts?

834
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,480
No, no, no.

835
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,900
I don't want that yet.

836
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,380
Where is the cysts?

837
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,660
This one?

838
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,560
Tumors?

839
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,580
Wait, wait, wait.

840
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,300
No, no, no.

841
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,100
Abscesses?

842
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,840
No, no, no.

843
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,980
Give me my money.

844
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:05,380
Paranoia.

845
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,660
The brain rot compels people to watch the video of Mint singing Santa Baby.

846
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,640
You guys like that video so much.

847
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,640
Why do you guys like that video so much?

848
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,580
It's not a tumor.

849
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,240
We love it.

850
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,380
And I have to do like a...

851
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,880
What's the word?

852
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,220
Jazzy karaoke sometime soon.

853
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,740
But I don't think you guys will survive, maybe.

854
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,080
That's okay.

855
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,960
Oh, we are at 2%.

856
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,360
Oh, sorry.

857
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,840
We are at 2% though.

858
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,660
For the cure.

859
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,100
More infectious than the common cold.

860
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,700
Okay, we need to get Madagascar.

861
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,800
We need to get New Zealand.

862
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,140
How can I see what countries I have not infected yet?

863
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,040
I got Canada, just a tiny bit.

864
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,420
I think like almost all of South America.

865
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,280
Just kidding.

866
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,340
Press info on world?

867
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,740
This one?

868
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,420
Oh, thank you.

869
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,760
We still have a little bit.

870
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,800
Let's see.

871
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,220
Let's give... We have a lot of points.

872
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,300
Let's do an ability.

873
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,500
Decrease research?

874
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,600
Wait, I think we need more hot climate, perhaps.

875
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,360
And let's decrease the research.

876
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,660
Pathogen strand reassembled.

877
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,580
We don't want to survive.

878
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,780
We want you to kill us.

879
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,160
No!

880
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,740
Because I want you to have happy...

881
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,640
How else am I supposed to steal your life force if everybody dies?

882
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,740
How else am I supposed to survive if I...

883
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,700
If I am then hungry for life force?

884
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,400
You guys are so selfish.

885
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,920
How dare you not think about Minto2.

886
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,900
We are at 6% for the world.

887
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,400
For the cure.

888
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,220
7%!

889
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:34,920
Oh no!

890
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,100
The brain rot was placed on a watch list.

891
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,700
Oh no!

892
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,320
Oh no!

893
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,600
Oh my god, New Zealand!

894
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,040
Wait, I'm kind of blocking stuff a little bit.

895
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,340
Hold on.

896
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,600
Let me make myself smaller.

897
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,240
I apologize.

898
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,460
I'll put my arms down too.

899
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,360
Now it should be easier for you to see.

900
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,560
There you go.

901
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,300
Okay.

902
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,360
Still need Madagascar.

903
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,940
Nobody is going there.

904
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,820
Come on!

905
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,420
We still have just a few places.

906
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,660
Nausea.

907
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,600
No, no, no.

908
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,360
I don't... I still think we need to...

909
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,780
Where is the nausea here?

910
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,780
Devolve, devolve.

911
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,400
Let's do transmission.

912
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,740
Let's do maybe...

913
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,030
Maybe an insect.

914
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,530
More again.

915
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,840
I've lost because of Madagascar.

916
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,820
I know, me too.

917
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,600
Sick for 5 months.

918
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,040
Is this the long brain rot?

919
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,120
No!

920
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,660
Where did Mint go?

921
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:00,980
Who is this?

922
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,100
What are you talking about?

923
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,160
I can put my arms down.

924
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,560
I have hands.

925
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,940
Kind of.

926
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,580
Germany!

927
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,300
Oh no, Germany is leading the global cure effort.

928
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:10,940
No!

929
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,140
11%.

930
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:16,760
Pop the blue to stop the cure.

931
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:17,900
No cure!

932
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,740
Oh no, Germany shuts down.

933
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,940
We also need New Guinea.

934
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,300
Where else do we need?

935
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,360
There are still quite a few places.

936
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,940
Wait, I think we just got New Guinea.

937
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,860
Nice, we just got it.

938
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,240
No cure!

939
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,240
Brain rot awareness day!

940
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,120
Chat, why are her arms down like that?

941
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,540
Brain rot awareness day.

942
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:05,520
Charities are holding the brain rot awareness day to raise the profile of this disease and encourage development of a cure.

943
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,060
The brain rot will spread.

944
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,120
We got Madagascar!

945
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,740
Is that everybody?

946
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,060
Just a few more.

947
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,740
Morocco, Algeria.

948
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,160
Two more, two more, two more, two more.

949
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,040
Two more!

950
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,240
No, stop mutating.

951
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,000
Actually...

952
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,680
Pathogen uses host lymphocytes to replicate.

953
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,460
Increase infectivity.

954
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,280
Yeah, let's do it.

955
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,780
Let's also... Abilities...

956
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,100
Let's uh...

957
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,860
Let's scramble, or scramble, or scramble.

958
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,300
Let's do some...

959
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,880
Maybe now we'll do water.

960
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,760
Infection!

961
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,820
Break, break, break, break, break, break.

962
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,640
Okay, the world's cure is only still at 22%.

963
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,140
And that is... everybody.

964
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,860
What happens if the brain rot can be...

965
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,000
No, it would not be that!

966
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,820
It would be...

967
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,700
It would be a... not that kind of transmission.

968
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,960
It would be like a... wait.

969
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,520
It would be a GTD.

970
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,940
A Game Transmitted Disease.

971
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,480
It's like, you know, the movie The Ring?

972
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,200
Ringu?

973
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,780
It's like that.

974
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,460
You play the game and you're infected.

975
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,180
You know, it's...

976
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:58,840
Oh, what was that?

977
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,560
25% complete!

978
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,540
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

979
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,300
No, no, no!

980
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,360
Evolve!

981
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,360
And also, let's get...

982
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,980
Okay, paranoia.

983
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,140
And things.

984
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:15,520
Okay.

985
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,720
They're gonna...

986
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,320
Wind!

987
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,200
I'm the avatar!

988
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:26,780
Wind, water, bug, blood.

989
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,500
Those were the four elements.

990
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,140
Destroy.

991
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,460
24... 25%!

992
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,520
Oh no!

993
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,420
The brain rot needs to evolve to kill.

994
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,020
Okay.

995
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,180
Oh god!

996
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,840
Okay.

997
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,180
Alright.

998
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,360
We must...

999
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,880
Inflammation!

1000
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,600
Seizure!

1001
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,600
Insanity!

1002
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,620
Fight the cure.

1003
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,060
We're fighting the cure!

1004
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,620
The Philippines...

1005
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,080
Has the first person that says...

1006
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,280
I don't wanna be cured!

1007
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,480
It's not a death, you guys.

1008
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,940
It's the acceptance phase.

1009
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,300
It's the acceptance phase where you say...

1010
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,680
I don't wanna be cured!

1011
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,880
I want this brain rot forever!

1012
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:26,980
Forever!

1013
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,300
It's not death!

1014
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,160
It's, yeah, brain death.

1015
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:37,920
How you say?

1016
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:38,220
Yeah.

1017
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,180
The first given salvation.

1018
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,820
Madagascar, you can try.

1019
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,340
Oh gosh.

1020
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,340
Global research focused on the cure.

1021
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:50,880
Okay.

1022
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:51,800
Good.

1023
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,140
We'll take the free money.

1024
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,040
Or we'll take the free things.

1025
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,840
They already know that we're here.

1026
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,400
We're here to stay.

1027
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,800
We're here... No!

1028
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,380
No cure!

1029
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,500
Oh gosh, is that 38%?

1030
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,420
Holy cow.

1031
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,040
Okay, we need to...

1032
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,560
Coughing!

1033
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,040
Coughing, rash...

1034
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,080
I hate the creepy children.

1035
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,480
Slight chance of infection when kissing.

1036
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,660
What's up with the kissing?

1037
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,720
Pretty sure that's death, man.

1038
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,960
You're just forcing us to visit you in the afterlife forever.

1039
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,660
No!

1040
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,160
Focus on lethal.

1041
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,280
I don't have enough money.

1042
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,420
We'll get more money.

1043
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,260
We'll get more DNA points.

1044
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,300
Oh my gosh, it's going up so fast!

1045
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,380
Tokyo Olympics mystery.

1046
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,140
Mystery still surrounds the decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics.

1047
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,560
Oh gosh, this is too real.

1048
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,640
Organizers promise it will happen soon, but no reason...

1049
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,520
No.

1050
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,660
No.

1051
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,600
No cure.

1052
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,360
50% complete.

1053
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,800
Guys, we're in trouble!

1054
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,620
We're in trouble, we're in trouble, we're in trouble.

1055
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,800
I can't scramble anymore.

1056
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,380
Wait.

1057
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:12,840
No.

1058
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,980
Maybe devolve?

1059
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:17,740
Devolve.

1060
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,440
These are fine.

1061
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,060
We...

1062
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,840
We've already spread to the places, right?

1063
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,180
So we should be okay.

1064
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,300
Paralysis!

1065
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,160
Alright.

1066
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,400
Oh my gosh, it's still going up so fast!

1067
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,880
Killed... Wait, it's already...

1068
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,260
How has it killed so many people?

1069
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,780
I thought we only killed one person.

1070
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,520
I mean...

1071
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,800
Oh gosh, we're at 60%.

1072
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,640
There's no healthy people left!

1073
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,680
Okay, now we can get rid of the transmission stuff.

1074
00:59:59,060 --> 00:59:59,640
Devolve.

1075
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,040
Devolve.

1076
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,420
Devolve.

1077
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,380
We need more points.

1078
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,980
We need more points!

1079
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,420
Everybody has a brain rot.

1080
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,520
Everybody has the brain rot.

1081
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,700
Okay, symptoms.

1082
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,660
Coma.

1083
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,020
How many do I have?

1084
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,160
I'm only at 14.

1085
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,680
Devolve the weak early symptoms.

1086
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,140
Oh, wait, hold on.

1087
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,580
I feel like we want insomnia.

1088
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,560
We want them to be less productive, right?

1089
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,780
Spread the disease.

1090
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,020
Okay, let's get rid of the things that spread, right?

1091
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,500
And then...

1092
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,440
I want the coma.

1093
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,800
I don't think we have enough though.

1094
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,300
Fatal tumor growth!

1095
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,420
What?

1096
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,140
Internal hemorrhaging!

1097
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,260
That's kind of big.

1098
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,260
Which one should we do?

1099
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,120
The tumor or the hemorrhaging?

1100
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,460
Think of it like this.

1101
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,080
It's not a regular tumor and not a regular hemorrhaging, you guys.

1102
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,820
It is.

1103
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,360
The hemorrhaging is...

1104
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,140
Is you just losing all your brain cells.

1105
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:25,800
You know what I mean?

1106
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:29,760
Hemorrhaging.

1107
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,160
Okay.

1108
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,880
Oh gosh, 64?

1109
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:35,940
No!

1110
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:36,740
No!

1111
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:37,860
Oh, sorry.

1112
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,300
My bad.

1113
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,360
Killed more than Spanish flu!

1114
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,120
Yeah!

1115
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,100
Give me more points, please!

1116
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,380
Yes, please, more points.

1117
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,660
Oh gosh, you guys.

1118
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,860
I think they are going to develop the cure.

1119
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:51,900
Oh no!

1120
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,660
I don't think we are going to make it.

1121
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,280
I don't think we are going to make it.

1122
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,960
I don't think we are going to make it.

1123
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,760
Oh, they are already at 80%.

1124
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,360
I have no...

1125
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,500
I have no...

1126
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,160
No points!

1127
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,520
Oh, there we go.

1128
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:11,800
Nice.

1129
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,020
We got the tumors!

1130
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,900
We got the tumors!

1131
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,120
We got the tumors!

1132
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,060
We've got the tumors!

1133
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,420
We've got the tumors!

1134
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,700
Oh gosh, the cure.

1135
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,440
What's this one?

1136
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,380
Decreases future research speed.

1137
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:34,740
Decreases...

1138
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,280
How much is this?

1139
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:38,600
31!

1140
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,460
I don't have enough at all.

1141
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,960
I don't have enough.

1142
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:48,640
Finland begins to break down!

1143
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,500
Brain rot.

1144
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,060
No!

1145
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,660
Oh no!

1146
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,400
The cure!

1147
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,300
Oh my god!

1148
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,040
Oh my god!

1149
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,180
It's happening so fast!

1150
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,500
No!

1151
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:10,500
No!

1152
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,200
No!

1153
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:15,650
No!

1154
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,650
My brain rot!

1155
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:19,690
No!

1156
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:23,850
The brain rot to be eradicated.

1157
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:29,210
The world has survived a devastating plague and will soon eradicate the brain rot forever.

1158
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:30,150
No!

1159
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:35,130
Guys, it's not powerful enough yet.

1160
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:37,910
No!

1161
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:38,110
No!

1162
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:43,010
All hail, king of the losers!

1163
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:50,470
We were so close.

1164
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:52,230
Share the news.

1165
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:57,430
My bacteria called the brain rot just got eradicated in 980 days.

1166
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,610
Dang it.

1167
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,010
Dang it!

1168
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:12,230
No!

1169
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,130
Shall we retry?

1170
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,650
The brain rot.

1171
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,570
Maybe, hold on, let's do like fox die.

1172
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:27,390
Maybe.

1173
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,090
Minky virus?

1174
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,690
Wait, it has to be in all caps.

1175
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:33,670
Fox die.

1176
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,250
Fox die.

1177
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,470
It has to be in all caps.

1178
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:38,810
I know!

1179
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:39,070
I know!

1180
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:39,830
I fix it!

1181
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:40,210
I fix it!

1182
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:40,690
I fix it!

1183
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:44,670
Fox die.

1184
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:49,710
Where should we start?

1185
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,510
I'm going to close my eyes.

1186
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:56,570
I'm going to close my eyes and I'm going to pick a place.

1187
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,210
So I'm just going to...

1188
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:04,270
Oh.

1189
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:09,770
Next one should be pregnant.

1190
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,190
No!

1191
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:13,170
Sorry, brain rot cured.

1192
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,510
Got to sell your patchy slot now.

1193
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:16,270
I will never be cured!

1194
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,270
I will never be cured!

1195
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:20,170
Oh,

1196
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,490
I accidentally went over to chat.

1197
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,350
You guys are the infected.

1198
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,730
Oh my gosh, I keep going off the dang board.

1199
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,750
Oh my god, I keep going off the screen!

1200
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,650
I'm in the ocean!

1201
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:48,690
Ok, hold on.

1202
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,630
Here!

1203
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:54,290
I ran to fox die.

1204
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,470
Fox die begins in Iran.

1205
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:04,930
I walk.

1206
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:07,990
Fox die.

1207
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,010
And I run.

1208
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:15,150
I run so far away.

1209
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:17,970
Why are we still talking about the Tokyo Olympics?

1210
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,990
And I run.

1211
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,080
I'll never get away.

1212
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,180
Get our DNA points.

1213
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,560
Here I'm going to...

1214
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,680
How is it so spreading so fast already?

1215
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:40,940
How are there already 18, 20, 21, 22, 20...

1216
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,880
Everybody is kissing!

1217
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,300
These darn kissers.

1218
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,700
I'll punch them in the kisser.

1219
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,290
Ok.

1220
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:01,930
Alright.

1221
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:03,610
Let's do...

1222
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:06,590
Let's spread a little bit.

1223
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,850
Let's spread a little bit.

1224
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:09,010
Wait.

1225
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:13,150
It does say, figure out the information about the country, right?

1226
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,650
Fox die has infected hundreds.

1227
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,630
Wow, there's actual pictures.

1228
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:20,930
Business as usual.

1229
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:22,850
Where is the information?

1230
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:26,930
Where is the information?

1231
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:32,390
Ok.

1232
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,410
Welcome to membership.

1233
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,110
Thank you.

1234
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:37,890
Ok.

1235
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:38,570
Transmission.

1236
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,210
Let's see.

1237
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,390
Are there bugs or mosquitoes in Iran?

1238
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,350
I don't know.

1239
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,610
Let's do hot.

1240
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,050
Hot temperature.

1241
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,410
And transmission.

1242
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:00,450
Maybe livestock?

1243
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,460
Rats?

1244
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,100
Livestock air?

1245
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,520
I feel like livestock makes...

1246
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,280
It's also cheaper.

1247
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,080
You have a successfully evolved fox die.

1248
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,820
There are mosquitoes everywhere but Antarctica.

1249
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,980
Lucky Antarctica.

1250
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,480
Canadians celebrate Hay-Herbert Treaty.

1251
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:41,340
Canadians celebrate the anniversary of the famous Hay-Herbert Treaty which saw Alaska become part of Canada.

1252
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,820
Americans outraged.

1253
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,020
What?

1254
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,920
Is that real?

1255
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,640
Kissing the livestock?

1256
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,060
You would be surprised.

1257
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,200
Someone's lonely.

1258
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,580
Working that late night.

1259
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,020
They see that little lamb.

1260
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,020
They are like...

1261
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,500
That's a soft sheep.

1262
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,020
We must take back Alaska.

1263
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,540
No, no, no.

1264
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,680
No symptoms yet.

1265
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,820
We must go under the radar.

1266
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,760
No symptoms yet.

1267
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,260
This game tries to sabotage me.

1268
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:30,400
For real.

1269
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,200
I did see some people saying air.

1270
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:32,720
So you know what?

1271
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,340
I'll do both.

1272
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,340
Are you a bioterrorist or an angel of death?

1273
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,020
I'm mean though.

1274
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,900
Yeah, I'm mean phantom.

1275
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,080
Very new player thing to do.

1276
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,720
Won't work later on.

1277
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,400
Hey Vtuber.

1278
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,260
Vtuber, you've played this game two times already.

1279
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,780
I think you should be an expert.

1280
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,460
Fox die infecting more countries.

1281
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,580
She is in fact mint though.

1282
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,020
Yeah, I'm mint phantom.

1283
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,440
I'm mint phantom.

1284
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,480
More infectious than TV.

1285
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,280
Oh shoot.

1286
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:34,420
Okay.

1287
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,320
Okay, it's going crazy now.

1288
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,120
It's going bonkers.

1289
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,740
Is that an infected one?

1290
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,700
I don't think so.

1291
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,300
Not yet at least.

1292
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,180
It was a little landlocked.

1293
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,180
But it's spreading, it's spreading.

1294
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,320
We're getting into the other places.

1295
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,180
Maybe if it gets into India.

1296
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,960
Holy moly.

1297
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,820
Almost everybody in Iran is infected.

1298
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,680
And there goes everybody.

1299
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:11,120
And that's the whole country.

1300
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,460
It's very slowly infecting the other places.

1301
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,380
We do also need to get into the colder places.

1302
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,480
So let's evolve with the cold resistance.

1303
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,160
And let's do this one as well.

1304
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,760
All this disease talk is making me sick.

1305
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,460
Love sick for you.

1306
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,900
Get some help.

1307
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,220
Get some help, clockwork.

1308
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,860
No mutation.

1309
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,540
No mutation without compensation.

1310
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,160
Nice, nice, nice.

1311
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,540
The spread, the spread, the spread.

1312
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,480
The spread, the spread, the spread.

1313
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,740
G-S-H.

1314
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,840
Get well soon.

1315
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,900
G-W-S.

1316
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,420
G-W?

1317
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,480
G-W?

1318
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,220
Alright.

1319
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:22,960
Alright.

1320
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,020
You know what, we'll make it go faster.

1321
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,140
We will make it go faster.

1322
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,260
It's scary though when it goes fast.

1323
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,140
When there is, you know...

1324
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,140
When there is the...

1325
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,880
What's it called?

1326
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,320
Human countries have more rainfall.

1327
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,260
When they start getting to the cure stuff, you know.

1328
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:56,400
Oh my god.

1329
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:01,570
Guys...

1330
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:02,510
Um...

1331
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:09,250
New cleaning techniques are now being used to stop ships transmitting any diseases.

1332
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,770
Oh no, Madagascar.

1333
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:13,850
Only advanced waterborne diseases can survive on them.

1334
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:14,930
Okay, we need to...

1335
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:17,570
We need to do...

1336
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:19,430
Evolution.

1337
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,390
I'm going to get rid of the sheep.

1338
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,110
Goodbye, sheep.

1339
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:30,190
You were 10 points.

1340
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:31,370
Ouch.

1341
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:31,770
Okay.

1342
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:35,370
Upgrade.

1343
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,170
Let ships be infected again.

1344
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:38,570
I did it.

1345
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:39,350
I worked.

1346
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:47,250
I like how it shows Alaska even though it meant Canada.

1347
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,350
Okay.

1348
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,670
Nice.

1349
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,030
Nice.

1350
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:54,170
Let's do...

1351
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:57,690
Oh, we got Madagascar.

1352
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:02,460
Okay.

1353
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,880
Still no New Zealand.

1354
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,560
Okay.

1355
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,780
And we also have...

1356
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,180
Iceland, but not Greenland.

1357
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,940
Don't... For this, should it be...

1358
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:18,120
Wait.

1359
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,560
D-G-W-E.

1360
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,080
Don't get well ever.

1361
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,840
For this, maybe.

1362
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:34,040
All the get well cards that you would buy at the store, they're outlawed.

1363
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,440
We won't allow it.

1364
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,320
We won't allow it.

1365
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,400
Oh shoot.

1366
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:39,720
Okay.

1367
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,720
What happens after MGS4 game is over?

1368
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:44,460
I cry.

1369
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:44,540
Okay.

1370
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,980
I cry and just think about MGS4 some more, honestly.

1371
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,640
Insomnia.

1372
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,140
Is insomnia okay to have?

1373
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,180
Maybe it makes people a little less productive.

1374
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,900
I think that one is okay, honestly.

1375
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,080
New minor disease.

1376
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,500
A doctor in Saudi Arabia found a new disease which has been named the Fox Die.

1377
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:10,480
It appears to be mostly harmless.

1378
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,260
Yeah, it is mostly harmless.

1379
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:12,980
What?

1380
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,160
No.

1381
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,560
Already?

1382
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,220
They're working on a cure already?

1383
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,560
We still have so many countries we haven't even gotten.

1384
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:25,880
So many.

1385
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,080
We need more cold.

1386
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,960
Not that kind of cold.

1387
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:35,260
We need more this cold.

1388
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:36,840
Evolve.

1389
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,720
Tokyo Olympics back on.

1390
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,540
Let's go.

1391
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,260
Greenland.

1392
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,220
Help the Olympics go viral.

1393
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,200
Yes.

1394
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:57,620
Yes.

1395
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:58,860
Go to the Olympics.

1396
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,080
Yes.

1397
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:01,860
Yes.

1398
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,900
Go to the Olympics and get the fox.

1399
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,720
We got New Zealand.

1400
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,580
Let's go.

1401
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,260
Yes.

1402
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:11,620
Maybe...

1403
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,640
No sir.

1404
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,340
Yes sir.

1405
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,760
We need also...

1406
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,280
We need these ones.

1407
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,200
Increase effectiveness.

1408
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:23,840
Here we go.

1409
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,480
I have to save... I have to save... What's it called though?

1410
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,100
I have to save disease points.

1411
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,580
I have to save disease points for fox die.

1412
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:45,430
Maria, I'm not asking for help right now, but...

1413
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:50,530
If I ask for help, then you can tell me some advice.

1414
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,110
But right now, I just kind of want to try and figure it out on my own.

1415
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:55,830
Fox die.

1416
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:56,750
Jet die.

1417
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:05,060
I was West Africa, so...

1418
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,140
Devolve.

1419
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,920
This one's also only two points.

1420
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,260
So you get back what you make.

1421
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,140
I don't want the nausea yet.

1422
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,740
I don't want them to think it's so dangerous yet, you know?

1423
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:24,980
How is Canada still not... Do we need that much coal that we have to get?

1424
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:28,060
Like these countries are...

1425
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,480
Yeah.

1426
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,220
Oh, we haven't even gotten... Okay.

1427
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:33,880
Yeah, cold resistance.

1428
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:34,820
Yeah, I think so too.

1429
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,260
I think I need to... Maybe against all climates.

1430
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,180
Maybe I do this one.

1431
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,000
Let's see.

1432
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,080
Fox die on the weirdest day.

1433
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:55,540
Yeah.

1434
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,200
Oh my gosh, we're already at 11%.

1435
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,860
I just noticed.

1436
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,940
Okay, but we've hit every country.

1437
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,060
Alright.

1438
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,920
But we still need to...

1439
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,580
Vtuber advance to the feudal era.

1440
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,840
I'm still worried about... Look, look, look.

1441
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,940
It's now really catching up here.

1442
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,120
Oh my goodness.

1443
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:30,360
I checked and fox die is six times better at infection than COVID.

1444
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,600
Mates confirmed to be more dangerous than normal viruses.

1445
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,880
Fox die is placed on the who.

1446
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,220
Although not very dangerous, governments warned that a more deadly strain could appear.

1447
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:43,960
I'm scared.

1448
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,320
No!

1449
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,320
No cure.

1450
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:46,880
No cure!

1451
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:47,500
No cure!

1452
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,060
Oh my gosh.

1453
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:57,480
You can shut down your airports, but you are already all entirely infected.

1454
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,400
Wait, how did you fly there if you shut down the airport?

1455
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,320
Already 25%.

1456
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:06,920
Holy moly.

1457
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:07,240
Okay.

1458
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,100
We're gonna scramble.

1459
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:17,960
No!

1460
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:18,640
No!

1461
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,400
Started fox die mint as Naomi.

1462
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,660
How dare you insult me like that.

1463
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,360
What?

1464
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:28,260
Already?

1465
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,860
Wait, how did you sequence it?

1466
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,020
I just scrambled it.

1467
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,280
How did you sequence it?

1468
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,200
I scrambled it.

1469
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:34,780
I scrambled.

1470
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,160
Oh shoot.

1471
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,800
Points, but...

1472
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,430
No!

1473
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,290
At least Naomi looks good.

1474
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,230
What are you saying?

1475
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,550
Start getting lethal?

1476
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:09,370
Okay.

1477
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,540
Paralysis.

1478
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,040
Coma.

1479
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,040
Total organ failure.

1480
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:25,160
No cure.

1481
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,060
Okay, bye bye everybody.

1482
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,140
Goodbye.

1483
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,640
Fight the cure.

1484
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,660
Fight the cure.

1485
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:44,800
Wow.

1486
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,180
Some of the countries are really holding out.

1487
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,960
Oh my gosh, the pop-ups are kind of annoying sometimes.

1488
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,200
I think we need to go even further.

1489
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,510
Iceland begins to break down.

1490
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,760
No, no.

1491
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,560
Oh my goodness.

1492
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,480
Rash symptom mutated, nice.

1493
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,100
Okay, alright.

1494
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,300
Let's spend.

1495
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:24,030
Does the genetic hardening and stuff even work anymore, I wonder.

1496
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:32,490
Or is the reshuffle better than the hardening?

1497
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,450
It slows research.

1498
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:37,210
Ah, I see, I see.

1499
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,820
Is that Elp asking?

1500
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,020
I am.

1501
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:57,410
If you kill faster than infect, you can also lose.

1502
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,010
True, true, true.

1503
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:00,970
Why not both?

1504
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:02,630
I don't think I have enough for both.

1505
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:05,590
I'm gonna try the reshuffle.

1506
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:10,470
I think.

1507
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,450
Hardening is usually better than shuffle?

1508
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:13,770
Really?

1509
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:16,310
Okay.

1510
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:24,310
Anarchy!

1511
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:27,530
60%?

1512
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:28,350
Holy cow.

1513
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:30,070
No, no, no, no.

1514
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,510
Guys, I think we are donezo.

1515
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,650
Guys!

1516
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:39,490
No!

1517
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,830
Please, please.

1518
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:44,650
Nuclear meltdown?

1519
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:47,350
Oh my gosh, huge nuclear explosion in Central Europe.

1520
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,590
I got an achievement for that.

1521
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,870
Holy cow.

1522
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:55,150
Okay, I have 80 points now, let's see.

1523
01:22:55,730 --> 01:22:57,350
I am gonna do this too.

1524
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:58,550
Reshuffle?

1525
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:00,910
Maybe that was dumb?

1526
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:02,590
I don't know, but...

1527
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:13,450
I'm trying to find the ones that say, like, makes it harder, you know what I mean?

1528
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:16,530
More dangerous in cold countries.

1529
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:17,310
Sweating.

1530
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,710
Infect?

1531
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:21,710
Okay.

1532
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,600
Let's do water.

1533
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,180
Maybe bird.

1534
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,280
Infectious lethal.

1535
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,560
Maybe we can just do all of... Actually, no, I don't have enough for all of these.

1536
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,760
Transmission and mutation.

1537
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,640
Based on Stalker, I think the last... What's it called?

1538
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:20,180
The achievement I just got was a Stalker reference.

1539
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,100
Okay.

1540
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,360
Okay.

1541
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:31,510
Oh, the cure has significantly slowed down.

1542
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:33,650
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1543
01:24:34,830 --> 01:24:36,430
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1544
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:37,810
Well, I said that.

1545
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,950
Okay, okay, okay.

1546
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:47,470
It's still really slow and... Wait, oh, that's why it's... Wait, huh?

1547
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,510
Oh, wait.

1548
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:55,650
Wait.

1549
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:08,480
Does that mean they are all dead or... Wait.

1550
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,660
What does that mean?

1551
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:13,980
Oh no.

1552
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:17,340
No, they all... Oh no, I didn't spread it.

1553
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:18,160
Oh no!

1554
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:18,320
No!

1555
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,200
I didn't spread it enough there.

1556
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,640
And that's why nobody else...

1557
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,700
That's why nobody else is becoming infected in Russia too.

1558
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,780
I messed up, you guys.

1559
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,660
Oh, I messed up.

1560
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,120
Greenland is just chilling.

1561
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,420
I was like, why are they so... How are they not moving at all?

1562
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,360
It's so quiet.

1563
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,940
Nobody is traveling at all.

1564
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,920
We killed more this time, which is exciting, I think.

1565
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,900
But soon we are gonna have killed everybody who is infected.

1566
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,940
Try bird?

1567
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:19,180
I already have bird.

1568
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,280
Hold on, I'm gonna devolve a little bit.

1569
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,720
Give me some more points.

1570
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,780
I don't know if the wind would work.

1571
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,400
I guess Greenland would be arid, right?

1572
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,860
Because it's so cold.

1573
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:48,420
No!

1574
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:02,820
Rats wouldn't be good, I think, because nobody is taking a boat to Greenland, you know?

1575
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:04,720
So, it wouldn't reach.

1576
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,080
Yeah, Greenland is locked out.

1577
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,380
We got close.

1578
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,000
Yeah, I don't think Greenland is possible either, guys.

1579
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,920
RIP to everybody.

1580
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,680
Like, I can't tell.

1581
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:30,180
Is this just they are all dead?

1582
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:31,840
Or what?

1583
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,860
What does... Oh, yes.

1584
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,520
It means that they are all dead.

1585
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,100
This is messed up!

1586
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:43,660
98%.

1587
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:44,260
Gosh.

1588
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:45,920
No!

1589
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:54,260
Well, I think we are gonna lose Sweden and the Baltic states, but everybody else...

1590
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,740
Ah, we were so close!

1591
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,240
NT, NT, NT, NT.

1592
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,600
NT, NT, NT, NT.

1593
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,180
I wonder if I could...

1594
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:16,380
Nah, I still don't have enough to do anything.

1595
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,340
Yeah, we got Madagascar.

1596
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,740
Greenland is so difficult.

1597
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:32,200
Curse you and your... The name that was meant to confuse people.

1598
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:41,700
You think now that we are in the modern age and we know that Greenland is not green and Iceland is not ice that we would switch the names.

1599
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,480
You know, to not confuse people.

1600
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,560
You think that now we are in the modern era.

1601
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:56,200
We would say, ah yeah, we can make that... We can stop that joke now, you know.

1602
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,200
Oh, the Baltic states.

1603
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:02,480
The only one.

1604
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:10,510
Baltic states strong.

1605
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:12,250
Little by little.

1606
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,490
I don't think the cure is gonna happen.

1607
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,630
I don't know though.

1608
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:19,550
They are still healthy people.

1609
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:23,230
They just need healthy geniuses.

1610
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:27,230
This is a true...

1611
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:35,530
This is a true Stephen King's The Stand moment.

1612
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:40,530
Ripperoni.

1613
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:44,490
Yeah, we didn't get a lot of people left, so...

1614
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:45,830
Greenland just chilling.

1615
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:50,490
Naomi lost.

1616
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,330
You know what?

1617
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,130
That's the biggest win, right?

1618
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,970
Naomi didn't win with FoxDie.

1619
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:57,770
I don't feel so good.

1620
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:59,690
Lilliput, stop being dramatic.

1621
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,430
We are in the modern era and we still call them dashboards.

1622
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:10,410
Used to be a board that protected you from mud that horses would kick up when running.

1623
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,290
Really?

1624
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:16,610
Like the dashboard of a car?

1625
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,250
A car dashboard.

1626
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:37,040
7 billion people ain't too shabby.

1627
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:38,210
Yeah?

1628
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,770
Look at them.

1629
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:43,370
Almost 2000 days.

1630
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:46,850
Our genetic complexity was complex.

1631
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,830
We got one score out of five.

1632
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,030
It's so sad.

1633
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:59,430
My bacteria called FoxDie just died out in 1983.

1634
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,190
1983.

1635
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:07,570
The modern mudflap has taken over for the dashboard.

1636
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:11,590
I don't know about you, I still kick up mud in my car.

1637
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:18,510
I think the dashboard is still necessary.

1638
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:22,610
The important thing is that you choose life and then live.

1639
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:24,950
Don't you think, Snake?

1640
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,450
The bite of 1983.

1641
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,400
Oh my gosh.

1642
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:39,960
It's the bite of 1983.

1643
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,320
VTuber can drive?

1644
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,600
I can drive.

1645
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,220
And I'm a good driver.

1646
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,900
I've never been in an accident.

1647
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:51,560
Knock on wood.

1648
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,160
I've never been in an accident.

1649
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:54,840
Knock on wood.

1650
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,020
I've never even gotten a ticket.

1651
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:58,680
Knock on wood.

1652
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:02,900
I'm a good driver.

1653
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,100
There it goes.

1654
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,780
Yeah, but sometimes I have to possess people.

1655
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:13,120
Just because I'm a ghost doesn't mean it's so easy to get places.

1656
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:14,300
You guys don't understand.

1657
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:21,620
As a ghost, I'm mostly confined to my maid cafe.

1658
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:26,600
Because it's like where my soul is tied to.

1659
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,080
Ghosty nonsense.

1660
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:35,180
Sometimes it's also easier and faster to get places if I possess somebody.

1661
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:40,340
But if I possess somebody, I have to be able to drive or fly the plane.

1662
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,120
Or anything like that.

1663
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,520
I know how to do these things so that I can go around.

1664
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:49,180
Otherwise, floating...

1665
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,920
The further I get away from my maid cafe, the slower I am.

1666
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,300
That's just how ghost stuff works.

1667
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,580
You guys are all like, you're a ghost.

1668
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,360
You can just fly wherever you want to.

1669
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,280
It's not so easy.

1670
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:09,700
I didn't mean to click exit.

1671
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,820
What's a scenario creator anyway?

1672
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,060
Create and publish your own scenarios.

1673
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,640
I launched something.

1674
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,260
Hearing a lot of co-print.

1675
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,600
My game just froze.

1676
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,140
There we go.

1677
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:27,740
Nevermind.

1678
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,420
It's an online maker.

1679
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:36,480
Cure mode is the one that you have to get the DLC for.

1680
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,600
Which I do not have.

1681
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:44,680
I don't want my oshi inside me like that.

1682
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,560
Well, too bad.

1683
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,540
I've already been inside you.

1684
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,300
And you're gonna just accept that?

1685
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:55,980
Those are the terms and conditions you signed from watching my stream?

1686
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:06,570
You give Mint any time she wants to possess.

1687
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:08,930
You give her the okay.

1688
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,750
I trust you.

1689
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:20,090
Must take some real driving skill for you to reach the pedals.

1690
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:22,910
Chovek, what the hell is that profile picture?

1691
01:34:23,910 --> 01:34:24,470
Is that you?

1692
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,490
Is that you?

1693
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,030
Understood, boss.

1694
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,300
If you ever... I don't... But don't worry.

1695
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:44,120
If I'm possessing you, I don't like...

1696
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,520
I don't like... I don't like... What's the word?

1697
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,420
Is oshi drew that PFP?

1698
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,480
Fine.

1699
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,780
I see how it is.

1700
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:10,350
I see how it is.

1701
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:40,100
Just pull out the granite uno reverse card when Mint tries to get inside you.

1702
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:41,640
What?

1703
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:42,100
No.

1704
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:44,240
No.

1705
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,280
You can't possess a ghost.

1706
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,120
That's not possible.

1707
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,460
Say you hate him?

1708
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,180
I hate... I hate everybody!

1709
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:56,320
Whatever.

1710
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:58,760
Fine.

1711
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,700
I don't have to be your oshi.

1712
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,340
I don't care.

1713
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,480
I don't care.

1714
01:36:01,860 --> 01:36:03,820
I don't care if I'm not your oshi.

1715
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:04,460
Whatever.

1716
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:05,440
Get out of here.

1717
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,500
I don't care.

1718
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,160
I don't even...

1719
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,940
I don't even... I don't even...

1720
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:12,100
I don't even care about it.

1721
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:17,150
I don't even care about it.

1722
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:22,230
Anyway.

1723
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:26,970
Let's start!

1724
01:36:36,150 --> 01:36:37,530
Where am I?

1725
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:38,330
I'm in the ocean.

1726
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:44,430
I'm in the ocean.

1727
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:47,750
I don't care if you hate me.

1728
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,110
Grow my name.

1729
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:50,670
What are you talking about?

1730
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:53,490
Make you love.

1731
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:54,490
No!

1732
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:55,690
Too late!

1733
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:02,590
You'll pay for this in multiplayer Age of Empires.

1734
01:37:04,770 --> 01:37:08,310
Yeah, we'll settle this in multiplayer Age of Empires.

1735
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:16,330
Let's see.

1736
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:20,170
Back to Russia maybe.

1737
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:23,570
But you're not my oshi.

1738
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,510
You've always been my kami oshi.

1739
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:27,850
Really?

1740
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:30,050
Really?

1741
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:32,470
Really?

1742
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:35,050
No, I don't want to do Russia again.

1743
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:36,510
You know what?

1744
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:37,410
Greenland.

1745
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:41,110
Let's do Greenland this time.

1746
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:42,230
Chovek, die!

1747
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:43,670
Begins in Greenland.

1748
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,170
That is a threat!

1749
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:53,710
Hate isn't the opposite of love.

1750
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:54,570
Indifference is.

1751
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:56,130
Show us your fiery passion.

1752
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:56,710
No!

1753
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:56,750
No!

1754
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:08,670
I don't...get some help Evan.

1755
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:11,310
Heavy!

1756
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,270
Sounds like Minto is starting a movement in Greenland.

1757
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:19,010
Yeah!

1758
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:26,630
Wait,

1759
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:30,690
hold on.

1760
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:32,730
I'm missing reading messages.

1761
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:33,310
I'm sorry.

1762
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:36,230
Minto, you didn't mean that right.

1763
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:37,990
I'm shitting and crying right now.

1764
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,230
Charging this bat...No!

1765
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,330
You're not our oshi, but you're the oshiri.

1766
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:50,610
Are you calling me an ass right now?

1767
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:58,830
So not only am I not your oshi, I'm also a donkey to you?

1768
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:06,740
Zoom!

1769
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:07,420
Die!

1770
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,520
Maybe you should turn that anger into love.

1771
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:19,880
No!

1772
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:22,040
I'll never love again!

1773
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,040
Love only brings betrayal!

1774
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:28,340
I'll never love again!

1775
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,880
Which means we get Shrek too.

1776
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,440
Get oshi'd idiot.

1777
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,480
Mass panic over 3D printed robotic juicer?

1778
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,760
What is this a reference to?

1779
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:54,920
New robotic juicer banned in 17 countries after UN report highlighted its profoundly disturbing behavior.

1780
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,800
Authorities try to restrict access to the CAD file.

1781
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,040
What?

1782
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:04,260
Juicero?

1783
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,560
What's that?

1784
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,320
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

1785
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:11,840
Juicero.

1786
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:11,880
Juicero.

1787
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,020
Juicero.

1788
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,360
What is the...Oh my gosh.

1789
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,880
What is the downfall of Juicero?

1790
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,740
Why did Juicero need Wi-Fi?

1791
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,140
Why is Juicero so expensive?

1792
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,400
What is this?

1793
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,400
What is this?

1794
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:47,860
It was an American company that designed, manufactured, and sold the Juicero Press, a fruit and vegetable juicer.

1795
01:40:48,280 --> 01:41:02,320
It featured Wi-Fi connectivity and used proprietary single-serving packets of pre-chopped fruits and vegetables that were sold exclusively by the company on a subscription basis?

1796
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,320
No, it can't be this.

1797
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,220
I don't think it's this.

1798
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,060
It's just saying that it's a 3D printed juicer.

1799
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,320
That sounds like the most...

1800
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:24,380
Let me get my fruits and veggies on...my pre-cut fruits and veggies on subscription, please.

1801
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,780
Mito getting one guide?

1802
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,300
How am I getting one guide?

1803
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:31,080
Like 15 people said it.

1804
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,560
But so many people said it.

1805
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,300
I was curious what it was.

1806
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,240
15 guide.

1807
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,140
One guide by 15 people.

1808
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,640
True, true.

1809
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:55,540
So many people said the Juicero.

1810
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,120
That's craziness.

1811
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,940
I'd buy you the Juicero as an anniversary gift.

1812
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,280
I don't want that.

1813
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:08,840
I thought you supported DDs.

1814
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,280
Are ghosts always this possessive?

1815
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,960
Yes, I am possessive of a ghost.

1816
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,120
I possess...possession.

1817
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:34,880
Also, shut the hell up.

1818
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:40,560
Ghost, I paid Megatron to sing you happy birthday instead of me.

1819
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:53,010
I was like, wait, you paid Megatron to sing you happy birthday.

1820
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:59,490
Oh no, now I'm going to think about Transformers 1.

1821
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:00,750
Guys, welcome to my membership.

1822
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,250
Thank you.

1823
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:03,230
Juicero subscription fee.

1824
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,070
We like you possessive.

1825
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:11,210
I...I'm going to get angry for real and you don't want to see me angry.

1826
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:15,630
I'm going to get angry for real.

1827
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:20,210
Chovek is dying and infecting hundreds while doing so.

1828
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:33,230
Stop!

1829
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:33,750
Stop!

1830
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:34,750
Stop!

1831
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:36,050
I don't need your love.

1832
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:37,250
I don't need your love.

1833
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,690
I don't even...it's not the love that I want.

1834
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:45,970
It's your unbridled hatred that I would appreciate more than love.

1835
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:51,370
Crash, no!

1836
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:54,370
No!

1837
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,180
I don't care what you guys do.

1838
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:05,600
Wait, I didn't want to evolve.

1839
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:06,320
No, no, no.

1840
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,140
We're fine.

1841
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,220
I don't think it's Juicero.

1842
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:13,340
I don't think so either.

1843
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:22,180
Penny Arcade...wait...Penny Arcade Fruit Effort 2000...Fruit Freaker?

1844
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:26,300
I don't want to get supported.

1845
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:29,480
I hate this.

1846
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,640
You enjoy the possessive.

1847
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,600
Stop!

1848
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:36,740
Wait, there's...you guys, I'm trying to pay attention to the game.

1849
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,880
The age of Matara is over.

1850
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,100
Follow me and you will never get free.

1851
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,060
I hate this.

1852
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:51,080
Let me and Maddie kind of make the Hayley Joel Osment face.

1853
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,560
Don't say Hayley Joel Osment.

1854
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,500
This is so messed up.

1855
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:57,300
I'm gonna end stream.

1856
01:44:57,640 --> 01:44:58,800
I hate this.

1857
01:44:58,800 --> 01:44:58,880
I hate this.

1858
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:11,870
What if I got angry like this and make my face low?

1859
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,480
It's not nearly as fun.

1860
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,860
Get love bomb.

1861
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:25,100
This is a bad relationship.

1862
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:29,340
Mint's opinions on Western She's GD...

1863
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,520
Ignore the haters.

1864
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:36,000
You can possess me anytime.

1865
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,820
Cold country is getting colder.

1866
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,640
We gotta do stuff guys.

1867
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,580
We gotta get the spread out.

1868
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:47,040
It's time.

1869
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:51,020
Our pathogen must be released.

1870
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,070
I hate this.

1871
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:04,510
Why am I getting attacked like this?

1872
01:46:08,110 --> 01:46:11,050
UK votes for Brexit in...

1873
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:15,710
Too real.

1874
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:18,910
No, this is about FoxDie.

1875
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:23,730
No, this is fake.

1876
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:25,250
This is not real life.

1877
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:29,010
This is fake, fake, fake thing.

1878
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:32,970
No talk of realness.

1879
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:34,190
I think I missed it.

1880
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:38,090
Sorry, Chovek died.

1881
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,010
Sorry, my bad.

1882
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:44,570
Fake real life.

1883
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,990
No earthquake.

1884
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:48,990
Let's see.

1885
01:46:49,670 --> 01:46:51,210
Let's do...

1886
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:55,370
Since we are only boat for now...

1887
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:59,110
We've spread.

1888
01:46:59,270 --> 01:46:59,750
We've spread.

1889
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:02,210
We can do...

1890
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,520
Let's do water.

1891
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,970
The stream is making a bad day much better.

1892
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:22,890
I'm sorry I had a bad day.

1893
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:24,850
Is today Monday?

1894
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:27,410
Tuesday.

1895
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:29,170
For me.

1896
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:31,970
No, no mutation.

1897
01:47:33,010 --> 01:47:34,190
No mutation yet.

1898
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:36,070
Devolve.

1899
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:37,390
It's Tuesday.

1900
01:47:39,790 --> 01:47:40,450
You know what?

1901
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:41,490
Minto is kind of stinky.

1902
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:42,590
Sure.

1903
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,850
When can we start drinking mint juice?

1904
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:48,270
Well, if you use my code...

1905
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:50,850
GamerSups...

1906
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:52,930
You can get my code Boomer.

1907
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:55,350
You can pretend that it's minto juice.

1908
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,390
It's Wednesday, my dudes.

1909
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:03,490
Cyber, thanks for 6 months.

1910
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:08,770
Minto Code Juicero.

1911
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:09,830
No.

1912
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:12,730
Oh my goodness.

1913
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:14,490
You think everybody is infected?

1914
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,090
Why is it so slow elsewhere?

1915
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,870
Okay, we gotta up the ante, everybody.

1916
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:23,050
But we gotta go under their noses, right?

1917
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:26,170
Really kind of under their noses.

1918
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:29,070
They'll never see it coming.

1919
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:32,290
Never see it coming.

1920
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:39,110
I would sell my soul for a Minto wife cup.

1921
01:48:39,850 --> 01:48:43,230
It might be more real than you think.

1922
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:45,190
I don't know when it's gonna come out though.

1923
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:49,090
What minto juice tastes like?

1924
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:52,470
I think it would taste like...

1925
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:55,330
I think most people would be like, of course mint juice would taste like mint.

1926
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:56,330
But I don't believe that.

1927
01:48:57,150 --> 01:49:00,010
I think I would wanna taste like a melon soda.

1928
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:01,970
Like a melon cream soda, you know?

1929
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:05,930
Trip.

1930
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:06,430
Trip.

1931
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:08,650
Thanks for nine months.

1932
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:11,350
The festival of love.

1933
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:12,830
Wait, is this now in Norway?

1934
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:16,030
Anybody can have a festival of love.

1935
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,480
Melon cream soda is one of the best drinks ever.

1936
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,740
Even though I can't have a soda.

1937
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:32,080
I still... I will... I try to drink that.

1938
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,520
If I have the opportunity to.

1939
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,680
I love melon cream soda.

1940
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:39,820
Minky's melons.

1941
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:40,120
No!

1942
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,400
Festival of love is now in Mint's chat.

1943
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,500
Are the wisps getting freaky?

1944
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,520
In my chat.

1945
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,240
I thought you can't drink soda.

1946
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:00,260
No, I can.

1947
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:01,140
I just said that.

1948
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,920
I said even if I can't drink soda, I still like to try it.

1949
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,180
I drink and I suffer.

1950
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,280
Ectoplasm and...

1951
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:20,200
Ectoplasm and...

1952
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,200
Carbonation does not mix.

1953
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:28,810
Same with me and Derry.

1954
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:30,950
Oh no, that's a little different.

1955
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:37,610
I need to get help just because I proposed a few times.

1956
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:41,930
Says the person who...

1957
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:46,610
Who tried to post themselves in a tiny car and was like...

1958
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:48,270
Hey Mint, isn't this your ride?

1959
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:50,130
Shut the hell up, Evan.

1960
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:51,190
Shut up.

1961
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:52,610
Okay, we made it to Australia.

1962
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:55,710
Still not in New Zealand yet.

1963
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:56,990
Rash symptom.

1964
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:57,750
No, no, no.

1965
01:50:58,430 --> 01:50:59,570
No symptom, no symptom.

1966
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:02,150
I feel like I'm...

1967
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:03,690
Let's do air.

1968
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:05,570
Air.

1969
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:06,450
Water.

1970
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:10,010
And the blood to blood.

1971
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:12,750
No, yeah, blood to blood.

1972
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:17,710
Why are you such a hater today?

1973
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:18,630
I don't know.

1974
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:20,650
You are a hater everyday, Chovek.

1975
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:21,110
Shut up.

1976
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:26,330
Get your sassy gay ass out of here.

1977
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:40,890
Sorry, am I too sassy today too?

1978
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:42,290
Sorry.

1979
01:51:42,830 --> 01:51:44,870
Maybe I'm the sassy gay ass.

1980
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:51,830
Now I'm fine?

1981
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:52,230
Okay.

1982
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:55,390
Am I spicy today?

1983
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:56,230
Sorry.

1984
01:51:57,810 --> 01:51:58,890
Should I be nicer?

1985
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:02,810
It's the ghost in me, you know?

1986
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:04,510
Chovek, calm down.

1987
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:07,290
What does sassy mean though?

1988
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:08,750
Awesome stream today.

1989
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:10,310
Stop.

1990
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:12,670
Stop it.

1991
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:15,030
Stop it.

1992
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:16,110
Okay.

1993
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:19,090
Let's do...

1994
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:20,750
Heat, I think.

1995
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:22,550
We need the hotter climate.

1996
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,440
Chovek is living my dreams today.

1997
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,480
No, no, no.

1998
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,380
Can you be mean to me next?

1999
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:38,680
No.

2000
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:40,940
Mint collab.

2001
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:43,220
Drink at a concept cafe.

2002
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:45,080
Cilantro cream soda?

2003
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,680
Do you have the cilantro gene?

2004
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:50,220
The one that makes it taste like a soap?

2005
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,760
More infectious than a comical.

2006
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,600
Has anybody...

2007
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,920
Nobody has discovered it yet though.

2008
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,920
Just got infected with spicy mint though.

2009
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:00,840
It's terri...

2010
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,800
Oh my gosh.

2011
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:04,200
No, I lost it.

2012
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,040
No.

2013
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,820
Sacrifice myself and take all the sass.

2014
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,200
The acrass.

2015
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,120
More like the sass.

2016
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:15,880
Okay.

2017
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,440
Nice, nice.

2018
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:19,540
Where are we still waiting on?

2019
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:21,260
Actually, quite a bit.

2020
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,700
Quite a bit, quite a bit.

2021
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:29,480
Will you forgive me if I cosplay Raiders in Diablo 5?

2022
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:32,200
I don't know if I will...

2023
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,000
Be an off guy.

2024
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:40,400
I would like to try and do like maybe a parking lot meet up or something.

2025
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,220
You know, something silly like that.

2026
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:46,380
Maybe if I can like get...

2027
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:49,360
Maybe borrow an iPad from somebody and...

2028
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:53,520
Maybe if somebody wants to hold the iPad or something...

2029
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,020
And then I can do a meet and greet in the parking lot or whatever.

2030
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:06,020
Let's forget our panel.

2031
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:06,860
No!

2032
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:10,760
But, you know, that's not accepted, right?

2033
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:15,100
I don't get to meet people there.

2034
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,020
One on one.

2035
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:23,440
But you're coming to Dokomi, right?

2036
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:25,760
If you want me at a convention...

2037
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,640
To ask the convention.

2038
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:32,340
I've not heard anything from Dokomi.

2039
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:37,080
So I could not say if I'm going or not.

2040
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:37,500
OK.

2041
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:38,920
We're spreading.

2042
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:39,800
We're...

2043
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:40,700
Yeah, yeah.

2044
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:41,480
We're doing well.

2045
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,200
We're doing well.

2046
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:49,750
How much more?

2047
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:50,950
OK!

2048
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:52,890
We've reached the world!

2049
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:54,610
Let's go!

2050
01:54:55,770 --> 01:54:56,390
Let's go.

2051
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:59,610
It's so difficult trying to find a balance between...

2052
01:55:01,690 --> 01:55:04,390
Infection and spread, you know, everything.

2053
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:07,810
Trying to get it all together in the perfect balance.

2054
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:09,150
Let's do this one.

2055
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:11,730
So now should hit up more climates.

2056
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:12,630
Look at that!

2057
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:12,970
Look at that!

2058
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:13,270
Look at that!

2059
01:55:13,310 --> 01:55:13,590
Look at that!

2060
01:55:14,570 --> 01:55:19,550
I think Production Yakai and Oshispark might be hosting unofficial meet and greets.

2061
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:21,030
Oh, maybe.

2062
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:21,810
I don't know.

2063
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:23,490
I've not heard anything.

2064
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,510
Why is America...

2065
01:55:27,510 --> 01:55:29,110
Oh, I think I need to do this.

2066
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:35,750
Will that help?

2067
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:37,270
Just a little bit.

2068
01:55:38,110 --> 01:55:41,910
I won't scatter your sorrow into the heartless sea unless you're Chovek.

2069
01:55:42,230 --> 01:55:46,130
I swear to god if we win from this one...

2070
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:50,790
Then I feel a fear.

2071
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:54,610
If you don't appear I won't...

2072
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:54,750
Stop!

2073
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:57,870
Heavy flooding in Brazil?

2074
01:55:58,090 --> 01:55:58,270
No!

2075
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:00,610
You're saying we can get Minto at...

2076
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:02,470
Shot show?

2077
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:03,210
What's that?

2078
01:56:07,610 --> 01:56:08,370
You know what?

2079
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:09,290
Let's... Wait.

2080
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:13,110
We'll keep the insomnia.

2081
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:17,470
That might be my downfall, but we'll keep it for now.

2082
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:25,780
They finally found it.

2083
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:30,840
They finally started listening into it.

2084
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:31,420
Interesting.

2085
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,280
It's more of a Doki Bird show.

2086
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,040
What are you talking about?

2087
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:39,100
I play Metal Gear.

2088
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,780
Doki only knows...

2089
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:47,400
The killer.

2090
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:48,780
Oh gosh, already?

2091
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,840
Oh gosh, okay, hold on.

2092
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:54,280
We can get more spreading in America.

2093
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:58,020
Why is it not doing well here?

2094
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:01,720
No, no, no.

2095
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:04,440
Tokyo Olympics infect Japan.

2096
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,940
All because of insomnia.

2097
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:08,860
What the hell?

2098
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,160
They're so crazy about it.

2099
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:14,080
Big gun industry show in Vegas.

2100
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:15,200
It was last week.

2101
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:19,220
I want Mint that...

2102
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,380
Joe paw.

2103
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:22,280
Joe mama?

2104
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:23,360
Is that a Joe mama?

2105
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:25,760
Okay, let's see.

2106
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,660
Let's infect the...

2107
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,280
Transmission?

2108
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,320
Humid.

2109
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:45,000
Hot climates.

2110
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:48,440
United States is everything.

2111
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,200
Joe con...

2112
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,460
Joe condies?

2113
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:56,060
What?

2114
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:58,180
What?

2115
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,840
That doesn't even make sense.

2116
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:02,840
Oh, make land.

2117
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:06,800
Alright, maybe more infectious now.

2118
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:08,140
With the birds.

2119
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:16,700
Things are pretty heavily infected here.

2120
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:18,580
Oh, choke on.

2121
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,700
Wow.

2122
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:26,280
Alright.

2123
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:28,620
Time to ramp up, baby.

2124
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,400
Time to...

2125
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,400
Ramp up soon.

2126
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,460
Okay.

2127
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:38,640
Alright.

2128
01:58:41,650 --> 01:58:41,950
No.

2129
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:43,350
Rash symptom.

2130
01:58:43,710 --> 01:58:44,030
You know what?

2131
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:44,230
Yeah.

2132
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:46,390
Do it.

2133
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:46,870
Wait.

2134
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:50,350
Russia is like not enough I feel.

2135
01:58:50,610 --> 01:58:51,430
I fear.

2136
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:54,610
Let's do... Okay.

2137
01:58:55,190 --> 01:58:55,670
Symptoms.

2138
01:58:56,010 --> 01:58:57,990
We are going to do coughing.

2139
01:58:58,950 --> 01:59:00,210
And we are going to do airborne.

2140
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:01,330
Right?

2141
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:01,830
Right?

2142
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:02,010
Right?

2143
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:02,270
Right?

2144
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:05,670
We are also going to do paranoia.

2145
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:06,890
I like these ones.

2146
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:07,710
They are so exciting.

2147
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:09,490
Maybe time to kill?

2148
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:13,190
Pneumonia.

2149
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:18,390
Maybe it's time for death.

2150
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,550
Needs to evolve to kill.

2151
01:59:21,710 --> 01:59:21,890
Okay.

2152
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:22,970
Okay.

2153
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:23,450
Okay.

2154
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:25,430
We'll evolve to kill.

2155
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:31,230
Sneezing.

2156
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:34,190
Immune suppression.

2157
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:40,870
25%.

2158
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,410
First death in Japan.

2159
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:43,810
Goodbye.

2160
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:47,170
Okay.

2161
01:59:47,170 --> 01:59:47,230
Okay.

2162
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:50,350
Okay.

2163
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:55,250
Maybe I went to cycle mode.

2164
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:56,810
Oh my god!

2165
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:57,310
The cure!

2166
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:57,970
The cure!

2167
01:59:58,170 --> 01:59:58,330
The cure!

2168
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:58,710
The cure!

2169
01:59:58,830 --> 01:59:59,130
The cure!

2170
01:59:59,970 --> 02:00:00,450
Wait!

2171
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:00,710
Wait!

2172
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:00,950
Wait!

2173
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:01,210
Wait!

2174
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:02,030
Wait!

2175
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:02,750
Wait!

2176
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:02,950
Wait!

2177
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:03,190
Wait!

2178
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:05,430
Wait a moment.

2179
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:06,910
Wait a moment.

2180
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:10,710
I only have 30 left.

2181
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:13,570
Okay.

2182
02:00:13,770 --> 02:00:14,190
33.

2183
02:00:17,170 --> 02:00:19,870
There are no healthy people left in the world!

2184
02:00:21,810 --> 02:00:23,090
Full lethal.

2185
02:00:26,210 --> 02:00:27,070
That's it.

2186
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:29,970
Ta-da!

2187
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:32,430
Bye bye world!

2188
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:35,570
No.

2189
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,990
No.

2190
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:41,590
Sayonara everything.

2191
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:43,270
Oh gosh, 50% already though.

2192
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:44,010
Oh my god!

2193
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:45,510
Everything is happening so fast!

2194
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:46,710
I have no money.

2195
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:49,770
Oh my god.

2196
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:50,730
I have no money.

2197
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:51,670
I have no money.

2198
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:52,630
I have no money.

2199
02:00:52,970 --> 02:00:53,650
I have no money.

2200
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:54,630
70%!

2201
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:56,090
You guys, this is not good.

2202
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:57,390
75!

2203
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:58,550
Oh my god.

2204
02:00:58,730 --> 02:00:59,670
It's happening so fast.

2205
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:00,670
I need to slow it down.

2206
02:01:01,810 --> 02:01:02,170
Okay.

2207
02:01:02,290 --> 02:01:02,750
I have 45.

2208
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:03,130
Okay.

2209
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:03,350
Okay.

2210
02:01:03,410 --> 02:01:03,530
Okay.

2211
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:03,810
Hold on.

2212
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:05,790
Okay.

2213
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:06,010
Okay.

2214
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:06,230
Okay.

2215
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,410
Okay.

2216
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,630
Abilities.

2217
02:01:09,450 --> 02:01:09,810
This.

2218
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:10,870
Evolve.

2219
02:01:12,290 --> 02:01:13,650
I think the symptoms are fine.

2220
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:14,790
I think the symptoms are fine.

2221
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:16,750
I think, maybe.

2222
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,770
I don't know which one to buy.

2223
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:30,070
Buy, buy, buy.

2224
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:30,830
But what to buy?

2225
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:37,150
Complete global Minto saturation.

2226
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:39,650
Coma?

2227
02:01:39,870 --> 02:01:40,230
Which one?

2228
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,630
Where?

2229
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:42,030
That's this one, right?

2230
02:01:44,650 --> 02:01:46,430
I don't think I have enough for it.

2231
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:48,950
I don't think I have enough for coma.

2232
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:51,530
Or is this?

2233
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:52,330
Oh this is coma.

2234
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:54,710
I don't have enough for it.

2235
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:00,340
Save for it.

2236
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:03,720
It's a race against the clock!

2237
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:10,040
It's a race against the clock for real.

2238
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:11,440
Oh my gosh.

2239
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,060
Oh my god.

2240
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,500
I don't know guys.

2241
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:17,160
Oh wait.

2242
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:17,760
Wait.

2243
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:18,520
It's slowing down.

2244
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,100
It's slowing down.

2245
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:20,020
It's slowing down.

2246
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:20,700
It's slowing down.

2247
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:25,460
It's slowing down.

2248
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:26,580
Wait, wait, wait.

2249
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,340
I just got the coma.

2250
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:30,620
Genetic reshuffle.

2251
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:32,320
Oh, sorry.

2252
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:32,940
I got the coma.

2253
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,120
Maybe we'll get it still.

2254
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:39,060
I think they are all sleeping now.

2255
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:42,040
They don't have enough time.

2256
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:44,060
They can't work on the cure.

2257
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:44,820
Everybody is sleeping.

2258
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,500
Oh no.

2259
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:54,040
Wait.

2260
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:54,940
It's going backwards.

2261
02:02:55,540 --> 02:03:00,340
Oh wait.

2262
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,560
I thought it was at 90%.

2263
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:05,520
Am I crazy?

2264
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,320
I need 30.

2265
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:11,000
I need 3 more points.

2266
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:15,520
No way.

2267
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,140
There we go.

2268
02:03:19,580 --> 02:03:20,360
Resh...

2269
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:24,340
Everybody change places!

2270
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,180
OK.

2271
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:36,540
This is it.

2272
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:42,520
Wow, I can't believe we won with this one.

2273
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,120
I cannot believe!

2274
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:50,400
I cannot believe!

2275
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:54,120
Chovek died to destroy...

2276
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,420
To

2277
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:18,840
destroy humanity.

2278
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,360
Ben, welcome to bamboo ship.

2279
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:21,820
Thank you!

2280
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:27,900
Goodbye everybody in the world!

2281
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:32,680
And nobody is safe from the Brit...oh, points.

2282
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:47,020
Cover idea.

2283
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:49,200
Bad omens.

2284
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:52,720
I don't know that one, but thank you for the suggestion Robert.

2285
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:01,550
Victory!

2286
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:06,110
Wow, exactly 2400 days.

2287
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:09,490
Spite is the most powerful renewable fuel source.

2288
02:05:09,910 --> 02:05:10,490
I agree.

2289
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,190
I agree.

2290
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:17,970
Bamboo ship's government has fallen?

2291
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:18,550
No!

2292
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,640
Poppy goes so hard.

2293
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:27,720
Is that like P-O-P-P-Y?

2294
02:05:27,820 --> 02:05:28,780
I'm Poppy, Poppy.

2295
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:31,560
I went to one of her live shows before.

2296
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:33,480
P-O-P-P-Y.

2297
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:34,060
I'm Poppy.

2298
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:35,380
P -O-P-P-Y.

2299
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:35,940
I'm Poppy.

2300
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:41,080
I think all it took was being Tsum Tsum'd over Chovek's profile picture to win.

2301
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:45,080
I wasn't Tsum Tsum'd.

2302
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:49,160
I was just saying, oh okay, I'm Naichiro Oshii then.

2303
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:49,920
I get it.

2304
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,140
This world shall know true pain.

2305
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:53,360
A phantom pain.

2306
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:56,460
Yeah!

2307
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:01,640
All we had to do was start in Greenland.

2308
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:03,500
Wow.

2309
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:11,500
Ionized helix gene type and virus plague type have been discovered and unlocked.

2310
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,740
Nice, nice.

2311
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:16,640
I kind of want to try...

2312
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:20,000
The vampire again.

2313
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:22,620
Thank you.

2314
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:24,080
Welcome to bamboo ship.

2315
02:06:24,140 --> 02:06:24,680
Thank you.

2316
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,520
Thank you, thank you.

2317
02:06:36,410 --> 02:06:37,550
Hi, I'm new.

2318
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:38,970
Can someone brief me on the lore?

2319
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:45,210
So far I know we're wisps amidst a ghost who doesn't want people to get pregnant.

2320
02:06:48,770 --> 02:06:50,450
I can have multiple Oshis.

2321
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:53,070
My heart has place for many tiny angry women.

2322
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:55,210
Who are you calling tiny?

2323
02:06:58,070 --> 02:06:59,270
Guys, is this...

2324
02:07:00,970 --> 02:07:02,930
That's not what I want to be known for.

2325
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:07,930
He seems pretty caught up.

2326
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:08,250
No!

2327
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,610
How about we have a self introduction for many new people.

2328
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,010
With some ominous music in the background.

2329
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:20,730
Hello!

2330
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:25,750
My name is Mint Phantom.

2331
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:27,870
I'm a ghost maid.

2332
02:07:30,190 --> 02:07:32,450
I love Metal Gear.

2333
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:37,850
I have a cat.

2334
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:38,730
I have two cats.

2335
02:07:39,210 --> 02:07:42,510
One is named Paws and one is named Butaro.

2336
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:53,080
Skip Ad, it's me!

2337
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,700
What do you mean, Skip Ad?

2338
02:07:58,840 --> 02:07:59,820
Nice to meet you.

2339
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:00,680
Nice to meet you.

2340
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:03,200
I'm God Gamer.

2341
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:05,500
I'm God Gamer.

2342
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,920
And God of bad luck.

2343
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:11,600
And...

2344
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:16,940
You can see which cat was after Brain Rot.

2345
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:23,400
I'm a little freaky.

2346
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:24,380
Sometimes.

2347
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,560
I have glasses that show that.

2348
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:27,520
Hold on.

2349
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,080
Let me get my glasses.

2350
02:08:35,390 --> 02:08:37,410
I'm gonna put them right here on my face.

2351
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:42,050
Then I'll become Freak Phantom.

2352
02:08:43,610 --> 02:08:44,110
Hold on.

2353
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,610
They are a little messed up.

2354
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:54,470
Plug the Toho Lost Word cover.

2355
02:08:54,710 --> 02:08:54,930
Yeah!

2356
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:56,310
I also...

2357
02:08:57,650 --> 02:08:58,470
Hold on.

2358
02:08:59,930 --> 02:09:04,430
I also did a cover for Toho Lost Word.

2359
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:06,730
The mobile game.

2360
02:09:07,190 --> 02:09:08,370
Link in the description.

2361
02:09:12,150 --> 02:09:14,170
What else am I like?

2362
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:18,250
What else am I... What else do I talk about?

2363
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:20,710
I really like maids and idols.

2364
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:24,270
I'm otaku.

2365
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:27,990
I really like doujinshi.

2366
02:09:32,150 --> 02:09:32,970
Singing?

2367
02:09:33,490 --> 02:09:34,930
I like singing.

2368
02:09:36,130 --> 02:09:39,390
I like long walks on the beach.

2369
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:41,170
I like...

2370
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:49,770
What else?

2371
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:50,990
Oh my gosh!

2372
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:53,450
I saw someone say dolls.

2373
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:54,250
Hold on.

2374
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:54,690
Hold on.

2375
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:55,850
I forgot the name of it.

2376
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:57,970
But I think I'm gonna get this doll.

2377
02:09:58,410 --> 02:09:59,070
You guys.

2378
02:09:59,230 --> 02:10:01,230
I think I got... Hold on.

2379
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:09,030
I think I got influenced to get... Oh my gosh.

2380
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,810
The Mozu doll.

2381
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:16,130
I think I got influenced to get a Mozu doll.

2382
02:10:16,170 --> 02:10:17,290
Have you guys ever heard of one?

2383
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:22,110
Have you guys ever heard of one?

2384
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:28,500
No?

2385
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:33,360
Right you freak.

2386
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:46,000
Welcome to membership.

2387
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:46,940
Thank you.

2388
02:10:48,820 --> 02:10:53,620
It's like... They're very... They're very poseable.

2389
02:10:56,080 --> 02:10:58,660
And I kind of... They were so cute.

2390
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:00,660
And you can get life size ones.

2391
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:03,480
I think I want one.

2392
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:05,260
You're a comedic genius.

2393
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:06,220
Don't forget that part.

2394
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:10,820
You legitimately caused my face to hurt because I was smiling and laughing too hard.

2395
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:15,720
We're gonna get full three.

2396
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:18,460
If you get one, don't...

2397
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:23,000
Don't style it as mint.

2398
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:24,460
Please.

2399
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:26,040
I mean you could.

2400
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:28,180
I can't really dictate what you do in the bedroom.

2401
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:32,640
But...

2402
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,820
Dr.Glorious, thanks for the time gifted.

2403
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:42,620
But you know, it's just kind of...

2404
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:47,080
Hmm...

2405
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:50,800
But...

2406
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,100
You know, it's...

2407
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:57,500
It would be so awkward for your friends probably.

2408
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:03,740
I kind of want one.

2409
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:06,140
They're kind of cute.

2410
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:10,580
Ah, so I'm so curious how it works.

2411
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,560
How does it work?

2412
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,620
Bedroom, what are you planning on doing with that doll?

2413
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:25,400
Posing it, taking pictures.

2414
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:26,900
I'll dress it up.

2415
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:31,840
Anyway, to the new wisp, this is what it's like.

2416
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:35,200
Mint fan have friends?

2417
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:37,160
You guys have friends?

2418
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,200
I know you do.

2419
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:41,700
Yeah.

2420
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,560
Yeah.

2421
02:12:43,740 --> 02:12:48,720
I too also sometimes meet with the people I call friends.

2422
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:52,220
What happens in the box stays in the box.

2423
02:12:52,580 --> 02:12:54,720
Oh my gosh, I can put her in a love box.

2424
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:56,660
I can put her in the minto box.

2425
02:12:57,300 --> 02:12:58,260
That I have.

2426
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,140
Someone gifted it to me.

2427
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:04,300
Wisps are my friends.

2428
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:05,340
I love that.

2429
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:11,340
Yeah, even though I get a little like, wow, you guys are having so much fun.

2430
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:19,160
I see you guys hanging out and going to cons, but not going to the convention.

2431
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:21,700
But sitting in a room and watching my stream.

2432
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:27,400
And I'm like, ah, you guys are hanging out without me.

2433
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:32,460
And

2434
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:40,540
I'm stuck at the maid cafe.

2435
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:44,860
You know, not dusting cobwebs.

2436
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:52,540
They make a 150cm mozu doll, so you can make a 1.0067114094 scale min...

2437
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:54,560
Don't do the math!

2438
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:57,820
Why would you do the math?

2439
02:14:05,690 --> 02:14:06,210
No!

2440
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:09,690
Aren't we hanging out right now?

2441
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:11,210
Okay, yeah, we're hanging out right now.

2442
02:14:11,530 --> 02:14:14,910
Nine months, I appreciate Minto and my fiancé.

2443
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:18,850
Is your fiancé also a V?

2444
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:21,310
Parasocial.

2445
02:14:21,890 --> 02:14:23,770
So, I'm paranormal.

2446
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:28,710
Wait, Minto, there's a doll from Kika Goods that looks just like you.

2447
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:30,130
Really?

2448
02:14:30,410 --> 02:14:31,830
Hold on, I'm looking it up.

2449
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:38,690
Kika Goods.

2450
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:45,570
It's UF doll Doremi Banzers.

2451
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:51,690
Oh my gosh!

2452
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:54,670
Wow, it's actually so cute!

2453
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:57,530
Wait, it actually looks so much like me!

2454
02:14:58,670 --> 02:15:00,070
Wait, you weren't kidding!

2455
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:03,170
Oh my gosh, it's so cute!

2456
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:06,830
It's a ball joint doll blind box though.

2457
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:07,690
What?

2458
02:15:07,810 --> 02:15:08,950
I need this!

2459
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:12,010
I need it!

2460
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:14,990
Oh my gosh, it looks so much like me!

2461
02:15:15,330 --> 02:15:16,570
The ears and everything!

2462
02:15:17,690 --> 02:15:20,010
You guys could get this and then you could dress it up.

2463
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:21,410
Wait, I'm gonna get this.

2464
02:15:23,950 --> 02:15:24,950
Can you show it to us?

2465
02:15:24,970 --> 02:15:25,970
Oh, I googled it on my phone.

2466
02:15:26,070 --> 02:15:26,890
Hold on, let me...

2467
02:15:26,890 --> 02:15:31,530
Here, for those who are watching on their phones, let me google it on my computer.

2468
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:37,430
UF doll Doremi Banzers.

2469
02:15:38,930 --> 02:15:40,610
I'll show you, I'll show you, I'll show you.

2470
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:42,990
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

2471
02:15:43,390 --> 02:15:45,030
Sorry, I'm seeing the pictures still.

2472
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:47,350
And they're driving me crazy!

2473
02:15:48,430 --> 02:15:48,870
What?

2474
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:50,870
Wow!

2475
02:15:52,030 --> 02:15:53,910
I'm not original at all, huh?

2476
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:57,830
Right, we need to get her a Minto outfit.

2477
02:15:57,990 --> 02:15:58,390
We do!

2478
02:15:58,490 --> 02:16:01,130
Oh my gosh, these are so cute, I've never even seen these before.

2479
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:04,430
Thank you for introducing me to them, they're so cute.

2480
02:16:04,930 --> 02:16:07,430
Make the doll stream on your days off.

2481
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:09,350
I wish.

2482
02:16:10,450 --> 02:16:11,970
Okay, hold on, I'm saving the picture now.

2483
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:13,010
I just found a good one.

2484
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:15,750
Look, look, look, look, look.

2485
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:18,490
Even down to like the hair vents and everything.

2486
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:20,770
Look!

2487
02:16:20,770 --> 02:16:22,050
This is insanity!

2488
02:16:24,070 --> 02:16:25,690
Your mind is original?

2489
02:16:26,010 --> 02:16:27,370
I don't even think that.

2490
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:29,290
Look at that!

2491
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:31,550
What the heck?

2492
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:34,070
What the heck?

2493
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:37,290
It could be me, it could be my sister!

2494
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:44,650
Here's my formal invite to you to watch Mint Phantom play Plague Inc.

2495
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:47,190
I won't stop until every brain is haunted by Minto together.

2496
02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:48,150
Would you like to join?

2497
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:48,430
Yes?

2498
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:48,650
No?

2499
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:51,370
Sounds boring, different game please.

2500
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:54,490
It's so crazy!

2501
02:16:55,670 --> 02:16:57,630
I want it so bad, it's so cute.

2502
02:16:58,570 --> 02:17:01,390
I want it so bad.

2503
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:03,290
Can I ask out your sister?

2504
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:05,270
There's also a lilac one.

2505
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:06,630
There is and she's tan.

2506
02:17:07,610 --> 02:17:08,570
I saw it too.

2507
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:11,170
Wait!

2508
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:13,150
This is on!

2509
02:17:13,370 --> 02:17:15,650
Wait, it's the blind box though.

2510
02:17:16,390 --> 02:17:18,130
Oh wait, nevermind, she's not tan.

2511
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:19,450
Sorry, I was looking at a different character.

2512
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:21,710
Oh my gosh, there really is a lilac one.

2513
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:23,550
It's the blind...

2514
02:17:23,550 --> 02:17:30,930
What if I bought one and I opened it on stream?

2515
02:17:33,210 --> 02:17:36,130
And then we could see if I...

2516
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:37,350
Oh, you have to build it even.

2517
02:17:37,590 --> 02:17:38,370
Wow, that's crazy.

2518
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:44,510
Oh my god, someone got her in the...

2519
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:45,450
Oh, she's broken.

2520
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:46,890
Oh my gosh, she's naked.

2521
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:48,250
Don't do that!

2522
02:17:48,410 --> 02:17:49,530
Anyway, back to the game.

2523
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:50,130
Sorry guys.

2524
02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:54,110
Back to the game.

2525
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:58,990
This doll will now be going out of stock courtesy of Wisps.

2526
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:02,150
Let me get one first though.

2527
02:18:02,270 --> 02:18:03,590
Let me get one first please.

2528
02:18:05,930 --> 02:18:06,850
Shadow plague.

2529
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:08,970
Gene discovered.

2530
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:10,590
Insert.

2531
02:18:11,210 --> 02:18:12,870
Oh, I don't have that gene.

2532
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:14,510
Good enough.

2533
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:16,430
Welcome, Fintmantum.

2534
02:18:16,770 --> 02:18:18,090
I hate that name!

2535
02:18:23,630 --> 02:18:25,990
The autocorrect turned off IRL too.

2536
02:18:31,650 --> 02:18:33,410
I sometimes bite my tongue.

2537
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:35,710
I think my tongue is too big for my mouth.

2538
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:39,710
I think my tongue is too...

2539
02:18:42,870 --> 02:18:44,910
I think it's too big for my mouth.

2540
02:18:44,990 --> 02:18:51,970
I saw a thing the other day about cutting off the thing underneath your tongue if it's too big.

2541
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:53,510
But I can't tell if it's too big.

2542
02:18:53,550 --> 02:18:54,990
Hold on, I'm gonna take a picture right now.

2543
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:05,340
It looks average.

2544
02:19:07,980 --> 02:19:09,080
It looks average.

2545
02:19:09,460 --> 02:19:10,340
Should I post it to Twitter?

2546
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:10,400
Should I post it to Twitter?

2547
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:15,280
Is anybody a doctor?

2548
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:24,700
Would you be able to tell me if it's too average or not?

2549
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:28,260
Tug reveal?

2550
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,680
No, it's under my tongue.

2551
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:33,840
It's the little piece under your tongue that kind of keeps it held in place.

2552
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:39,720
But some peoples are too... posting frenulum.

2553
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:40,940
Yeah, that's what it's called.

2554
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:45,420
Some peoples are too big and so they get them cut.

2555
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:49,700
And mine... I don't know.

2556
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:51,320
I think mine is normal.

2557
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:02,020
If you didn't get it cut off as a baby ghost, you don't need it cut off now.

2558
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,200
It's like a pee pee.

2559
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,260
My wife is a vet tech.

2560
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:07,760
She'll help.

2561
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:14,440
She would be best because I got that dog in me.

2562
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:21,220
Let's be a vampire.

2563
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,460
I'm gonna try casual.

2564
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:25,120
No, I'm gonna do normal.

2565
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:26,080
I'm not a baby.

2566
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:30,160
Nox Eternus.

2567
02:20:32,380 --> 02:20:32,820
Minto.

2568
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:38,620
I'm not a tongue doctor, but I am a registered podiatrist.

2569
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:42,980
So if you ever have any health issues with your feet, just send feet pictures to my inbox.

2570
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:43,900
Annie T.

2571
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:47,780
Oh no, Nano, your account got hacked.

2572
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:51,620
That's what happened to me as a baby.

2573
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:55,760
I had a lisp most of my life because of it.

2574
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:56,620
Wait, no way.

2575
02:20:58,120 --> 02:20:59,160
Um, hold on.

2576
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:01,040
Freak virus.

2577
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:07,240
Oh my gosh, the V kind of looks like a Y, so it looks like Freaky Iris.

2578
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:11,340
I can vouch.

2579
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:12,200
I trust him.

2580
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:12,920
Very true.

2581
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,240
Feetman hacked you.

2582
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:17,680
Freak virus.

2583
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:18,620
Freak virus.

2584
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:20,540
Freaky Iris.

2585
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:23,960
Mint your freak inhibitors.

2586
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:25,240
Did you skip that shot?

2587
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:28,520
I'm OK.

2588
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:30,000
Something is working.

2589
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:32,040
I thought I said something is wrong.

2590
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:33,690
Centuries ago a human chose to...

2591
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:36,320
Chose to death?

2592
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:40,680
I chose to death.

2593
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:43,060
Oh my gosh, what do they choke to death?

2594
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:47,880
I think...

2595
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:49,820
Oh close!

2596
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:50,600
Close!

2597
02:21:57,010 --> 02:21:57,770
Sorry.

2598
02:21:59,910 --> 02:22:00,630
I chose.

2599
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:02,910
I chose to death.

2600
02:22:06,270 --> 02:22:13,510
A human close to death was infected by a sentient pathogen, the Shadow Plague.

2601
02:22:14,010 --> 02:22:18,770
Buried deep underground, the human was slowly consumed and transformed.

2602
02:22:19,150 --> 02:22:20,550
Oh my gosh, such a freak.

2603
02:22:22,290 --> 02:22:22,730
Nosferatu.

2604
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:25,670
You guys.

2605
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:26,550
Oh my gosh.

2606
02:22:27,670 --> 02:22:30,310
Speaking of movies, I wanted to watch Wicked the other day.

2607
02:22:30,390 --> 02:22:31,190
Did I tell you guys this?

2608
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:37,330
I wanted to watch Wicked the other day and I went to go rent it and it was $30.

2609
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:39,390
Rent.

2610
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:40,810
To rent the movie.

2611
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:42,410
Not to buy it.

2612
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:45,070
It was like, actually it was more like $25.

2613
02:22:45,070 --> 02:22:48,250
But still, just to rent it.

2614
02:22:48,390 --> 02:22:51,290
And I checked on YouTube and I checked on Amazon.

2615
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:53,750
Just to rent the movie is $30.

2616
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:55,970
Like holy what?

2617
02:22:57,030 --> 02:23:00,170
It was only 5 more dollars just to own it.

2618
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:01,770
Just to rent it.

2619
02:23:02,030 --> 02:23:03,490
I don't like Wicked that much.

2620
02:23:06,470 --> 02:23:11,190
I might be, I might be, I might be, I might be coming pirate 5.

2621
02:23:11,310 --> 02:23:13,590
Oh, 5, thank you for the dono.

2622
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:19,650
I was like, that's actually stealing.

2623
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:23,330
Because you also only get to have it for like 48 hours, you know.

2624
02:23:24,490 --> 02:23:25,370
That's insanity.

2625
02:23:27,050 --> 02:23:29,890
And I was thinking about renting Nosferatu too.

2626
02:23:32,690 --> 02:23:34,470
Free at your local library.

2627
02:23:34,850 --> 02:23:35,130
Really?

2628
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:37,530
I have a library card.

2629
02:23:38,430 --> 02:23:39,770
I get freaky books from that.

2630
02:23:41,110 --> 02:23:41,970
Bro is down bad.

2631
02:23:42,030 --> 02:23:42,710
What are you saying?

2632
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:43,430
What are you saying?

2633
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:44,090
What are you saying?

2634
02:23:44,510 --> 02:23:45,230
I didn't see it.

2635
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:48,070
If your tongue is too large for your mouth, you can keep it at all.

2636
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:49,630
I don't want to read that.

2637
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:53,350
I don't want to think about it.

2638
02:23:54,030 --> 02:23:55,790
Choose where your vampire emerges.

2639
02:23:56,390 --> 02:24:01,110
The shadow plague has fully mutated the DNA of its host into being a great power.

2640
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:05,310
Now driven by eternal hunger, it is time to rejoin the world.

2641
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:08,990
This time, humanity will fall.

2642
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:12,970
Too lewd.

2643
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:16,010
I think all vampires would come from Australia.

2644
02:24:18,730 --> 02:24:20,230
Yay or nay?

2645
02:24:22,810 --> 02:24:24,410
Yay or nay?

2646
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,370
It's the eucalyptus trees.

2647
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,570
Nay?

2648
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:29,010
Why?

2649
02:24:29,570 --> 02:24:30,170
I don't know.

2650
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:35,590
I just thought that.

2651
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,580
Australia is so sunny.

2652
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:43,980
Then England.

2653
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,720
She might be right.

2654
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:55,860
Down under is closest to hell.

2655
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:57,120
See, you get my vision.

2656
02:24:58,600 --> 02:25:02,260
The only vampire movie that ever caught my attention was the Lost Boys.

2657
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:03,300
I strongly recommend it.

2658
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:04,940
Big Boss even stars in it.

2659
02:25:10,270 --> 02:25:10,830
Eucalyptus!

2660
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:15,070
Oh my gosh.

2661
02:25:15,170 --> 02:25:16,550
We have to start there.

2662
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:18,130
Eucalyptus literally joined the membership.

2663
02:25:19,310 --> 02:25:20,350
Have you seen what we do in the shadows?

2664
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:20,950
I have.

2665
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:22,150
I love that show.

2666
02:25:23,390 --> 02:25:25,430
I've seen the movie too, but I like the show more.

2667
02:25:30,930 --> 02:25:31,390
Eucalyptus.

2668
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:36,110
A vampire rises in Australia.

2669
02:25:40,030 --> 02:25:43,030
Can we name the first two vampires Remilia and Flandre?

2670
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:44,490
Flandre?

2671
02:25:44,690 --> 02:25:44,930
Yeah.

2672
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:50,930
The vampire is out here boxing with kangaroos.

2673
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:07,410
Oh yeah.

2674
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:08,050
Oh yeah.

2675
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,510
Oh yeah.

2676
02:26:09,210 --> 02:26:10,230
Oh yeah.

2677
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:10,970
Oh yeah.

2678
02:26:11,070 --> 02:26:11,610
Vampire.

2679
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:14,210
What is he gonna do?

2680
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:16,350
Gonna chill.

2681
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:19,710
Shadow blessing.

2682
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:22,870
The vampire releases the shadow plague to help subjugate humanity.

2683
02:26:23,310 --> 02:26:25,170
Victims develop severe bruising.

2684
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:27,270
The picture is so cool.

2685
02:26:27,490 --> 02:26:29,330
He's coming for my neck.

2686
02:26:29,810 --> 02:26:30,630
Oh my gosh.

2687
02:26:31,050 --> 02:26:31,910
Edward Cullen.

2688
02:26:35,030 --> 02:26:35,990
What's this one?

2689
02:26:36,470 --> 02:26:39,950
Vampires feed by drinking blood while they're still alive.

2690
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:42,590
Night Wraith.

2691
02:26:42,750 --> 02:26:45,950
Vampires adapt to the modern world and is able to feed much more stealthily.

2692
02:26:46,230 --> 02:26:47,210
I think stealth is good.

2693
02:26:48,310 --> 02:26:50,350
Makes it harder for humans to detect vampires.

2694
02:26:53,130 --> 02:26:54,930
This is a weird episode of Steve Irwin.

2695
02:27:01,050 --> 02:27:03,470
Your vampire can change the world.

2696
02:27:04,130 --> 02:27:06,230
Your vampire is shown as a red icon on the world map.

2697
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:10,250
It has unique powers and abilities, so use it wisely as you try to cover the world in shadow.

2698
02:27:11,610 --> 02:27:12,670
The vampire.

2699
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:14,250
Not the hedgehog.

2700
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:16,870
Hey dad!

2701
02:27:17,630 --> 02:27:18,590
We're hungry.

2702
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:20,590
Oh my goodness.

2703
02:27:21,430 --> 02:27:22,550
Oh, one purple dot.

2704
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:25,270
Teeny purple.

2705
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:28,970
Teeny tiny purple.

2706
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:31,770
How do we infect them though?

2707
02:27:31,810 --> 02:27:32,850
I don't want to just kill people.

2708
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:38,480
I guess...

2709
02:27:43,060 --> 02:27:45,040
Allows travel to nearby countries.

2710
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:46,920
Oh, we don't really have that.

2711
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:51,380
We have New Zealand and...

2712
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:54,320
Yeah, we have no spreading.

2713
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:55,940
We're only killing.

2714
02:27:58,180 --> 02:28:00,060
I guess we have to do the shadow blessing.

2715
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:02,680
Here it is.

2716
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:03,680
What is this?

2717
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:05,180
Vampiric awakening.

2718
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:08,740
Create a new vampire by temporarily producing toxic mutagens.

2719
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:14,220
Almost all infected will die, but eventually a viable host will be found.

2720
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:15,020
Reusable.

2721
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:19,980
And this mate is the wild Nosferatu.

2722
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:22,220
Oh, sorry I didn't say it.

2723
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:25,100
And this mate is the wild Nosferatu.

2724
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:27,260
Crikey, look at that mug.

2725
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,680
He's an ugly one.

2726
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,960
That's so mean.

2727
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:33,740
He would still appreciate...

2728
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:36,800
The vampire.

2729
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:42,080
He's a beaut.

2730
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:43,080
That's what he'd say.

2731
02:28:43,180 --> 02:28:43,900
He's a beaut.

2732
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:45,300
You're not ugly.

2733
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,100
He's just balding a little bit.

2734
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:50,680
But he still got hair strands.

2735
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:54,140
Enough to make a ponytail.

2736
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,680
He is pretty ugly though.

2737
02:28:57,880 --> 02:28:58,400
Nosferatu!

2738
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:01,780
No, definitely would.

2739
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:06,460
Let's see.

2740
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:08,400
What is this?

2741
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:09,520
Nocturnal.

2742
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:11,260
Infected struggle to sleep at night.

2743
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:12,680
Increases infectivity.

2744
02:29:13,620 --> 02:29:14,840
Cys develop.

2745
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:18,220
R1 DNA point.

2746
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:21,240
Infected.

2747
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:23,080
Oh, the freak virus.

2748
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:29,900
I forgot we called that.

2749
02:29:32,260 --> 02:29:34,620
Freak virus created by vampire.

2750
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,280
I know, the little bats are too cute, right?

2751
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:43,700
The vampire releases a unique strain of the shadow plague called freak virus.

2752
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:46,300
Which spreads independently from the vampire.

2753
02:29:46,740 --> 02:29:49,820
Infected humans have no idea what the vampire has planned for them.

2754
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:52,460
But if you turn all of them...

2755
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:55,660
Into vampires, would they not...

2756
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:58,380
Then you have no human food left.

2757
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:01,460
Unless you take some humans...

2758
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:09,280
And you breed them to be your food slaves.

2759
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:12,380
Yeah, human farm, exactly.

2760
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:17,420
Alright, I know you guys would be the first to offer.

2761
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:20,860
You guys would be like, me, me!

2762
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:22,120
Nosferatu!

2763
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:27,800
I'm half vampire, I have a fang, probably.

2764
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:29,520
And I'm a ghost.

2765
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,160
Which is...

2766
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:33,520
Like, tangentially related.

2767
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,120
We're both undead.

2768
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:36,220
Well, I'm not undead.

2769
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,400
I'm dead, but I'm talking.

2770
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:40,440
Close enough, right?

2771
02:30:40,600 --> 02:30:41,860
It's like my distant cousin.

2772
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:43,940
One cousin removed.

2773
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:45,440
From a vampire.

2774
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:49,540
We're both French.

2775
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:56,660
Freak virus needs help from vampire to spread.

2776
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:58,620
Your disease is weak and vulnerable.

2777
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:00,180
Your vampire must evolve.

2778
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:02,040
Evolve vampire.

2779
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:06,760
Vampire visits hundreds of humans each night.

2780
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:08,340
Sounds like a plan.

2781
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:09,180
Wait.

2782
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:15,840
Vampire able to create a layer for it to rest and heal.

2783
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:17,380
Also generates DNA.

2784
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,760
Infected population increases DNA.

2785
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:21,260
Oh, I like that.

2786
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,140
And then, blood rage.

2787
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:25,680
Will attack research military facilities if present.

2788
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:27,360
Oh, that's big!

2789
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:29,360
But, I think we need...

2790
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,180
Let's do this one first.

2791
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:35,800
Oh,

2792
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:41,980
I can only get three abilities.

2793
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:43,660
Wait, isn't that all there is?

2794
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:46,120
Yeah, that's all.

2795
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:46,520
Oh!

2796
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:48,140
Oops.

2797
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:51,440
Okay, I understand.

2798
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:51,820
Wait.

2799
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:53,940
No.

2800
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:56,000
You have to be able to...

2801
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:56,380
Oops, sorry.

2802
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,520
You have to be able to also transform into a bat.

2803
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,400
I like this Walmart...

2804
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:08,080
Sephiroth theme.

2805
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:09,220
It's good though.

2806
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:17,320
Alright, slowly but surely.

2807
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:20,420
Slowly but surely.

2808
02:32:20,420 --> 02:32:22,400
Slowly but surely.

2809
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:26,720
The music does go hard, right?

2810
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:29,680
Danish mafia becoming too powerful.

2811
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:35,720
New investigation into organized crime and anti-social behavior.

2812
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:43,860
It's very slow.

2813
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:46,220
Okay, we need him to go infect the hundreds.

2814
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:48,400
Okay, off you go.

2815
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:49,500
Off you...

2816
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:54,780
I think he opened his mouth a little bit.

2817
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:03,120
Pastry gangsters.

2818
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:07,540
Okay, now we're talking.

2819
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:09,700
Now we're talking.

2820
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:12,720
Oh yeah, baby.

2821
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:15,420
Nine thousand, ten thousand.

2822
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:18,320
Oh yeah.

2823
02:33:19,190 --> 02:33:22,260
Police can't explain brutal murders in Australia.

2824
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:29,440
The work of the world's greatest serial killer.

2825
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:33,980
And the serial killer will go against the Danish mafia.

2826
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:36,320
Serial versus...

2827
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:39,490
It's like a battle of the breakfasts.

2828
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:44,580
Freakferatu!

2829
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:54,520
Serial versus pastry.

2830
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:55,140
Exactly.

2831
02:33:58,210 --> 02:34:00,700
How many people are in Australia?

2832
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,360
Oh, you have like literally...

2833
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:09,400
Oh, that's 23 million... billion.

2834
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:13,700
What are thou thoughts on pancake frisbees?

2835
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:26,700
Vampire able to meditate and emit the shadow plague in a huge cloud.

2836
02:34:30,860 --> 02:34:34,680
Increases the speed at which vampires can heal when in their lair.

2837
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:39,380
Okay, let's evolve so we can head off to other countries.

2838
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:42,360
Everybody don't mind the bat on the plane.

2839
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:46,500
It's just a little guy.

2840
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:50,520
Maybe they'll fly to...

2841
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:52,440
Uh oh.

2842
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:59,440
The vampire feeds by drinking the blood of its victims, leaving behind drained corpses.

2843
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:04,220
It is only a matter of time before the humans realize that they are dealing with something far worse than a murderous cult.

2844
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:06,360
What is a ghost?

2845
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:09,440
But a miserable pile of expired blood bags.

2846
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:10,840
No, no, no.

2847
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:12,800
You say ectoplasm at least.

2848
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:15,000
How do you not get caught?

2849
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:16,640
Let's see, okay.

2850
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:23,160
The vampire is on a track during blood rains, enters a trance, and let it heal whilst feeding from people.

2851
02:35:25,700 --> 02:35:28,980
Victims develop additional muscle... Oh, increases infectivity.

2852
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:31,840
Let's get our infection up a little bit.

2853
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:35,920
Looking pale.

2854
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:38,420
You're gonna be strong and pale, baby.

2855
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:42,680
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

2856
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:44,920
This one's so tricky.

2857
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:48,180
Because there's just so many already dead, you know?

2858
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:50,860
We already have 300 dead!

2859
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:52,740
From one guy.

2860
02:35:53,540 --> 02:35:55,480
Is 300 not enough for you?

2861
02:35:55,560 --> 02:35:56,760
Quench your thirst, mister.

2862
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,220
It's been one day!

2863
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:03,340
He's hungry.

2864
02:36:03,460 --> 02:36:06,540
He hasn't fed in... how many years?

2865
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:07,600
Make a lair?

2866
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:08,780
I did, I did, right?

2867
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:11,940
This one?

2868
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:13,320
Yeah, we have a lair.

2869
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:19,680
We need to build up our stuff.

2870
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:23,080
What's the virus we're spreading again?

2871
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:24,880
The freak virus!

2872
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:28,760
The freak virus.

2873
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:31,640
The freak virus.

2874
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:37,120
Any bats gonna travel around?

2875
02:36:37,620 --> 02:36:39,000
To New Zealand, perhaps?

2876
02:36:40,580 --> 02:36:41,380
No?

2877
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:42,780
Okay.

2878
02:36:44,300 --> 02:36:44,700
Okay.

2879
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:48,580
Build lair with a button.

2880
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:49,260
What button?

2881
02:36:57,090 --> 02:36:59,330
Right in here.

2882
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:03,510
Hidden away from humans, this lair acts as a base for the vampire.

2883
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:10,750
Here it can heal itself away, as well as generate DNA by conducting genetic experiments on healthy and infected people.

2884
02:37:13,950 --> 02:37:15,010
Can I fly?

2885
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:16,310
No?

2886
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:17,010
Fly?

2887
02:37:17,470 --> 02:37:17,870
Fly?

2888
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:22,310
Let the world know of the freakiness.

2889
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:30,000
Oh, that's how it generates.

2890
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:30,660
Oh, fun.

2891
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:34,860
Okay, that's a little bubble we gotta click.

2892
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:36,580
Wow, Antarctica!

2893
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:41,800
I went to... I went to around here.

2894
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:43,880
It's not so exciting?

2895
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:44,080
Anything?

2896
02:37:54,430 --> 02:37:56,470
Anything on the news?

2897
02:37:56,890 --> 02:37:58,710
Grieving mother blames vampires.

2898
02:37:59,950 --> 02:38:02,430
Blogger claims vampires are real.

2899
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:04,130
Nobody listens to them.

2900
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:05,990
We're fine.

2901
02:38:08,910 --> 02:38:10,730
We're fine, we're fine.

2902
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:14,550
I've never seen polar bears, because those are in the north.

2903
02:38:17,650 --> 02:38:20,090
Blood cult leader tracked in Australia.

2904
02:38:20,450 --> 02:38:28,030
Authorities in Australia have confirmed that they are tracking a highly dangerous individual who they believe is responsible for the horrifying blood cult murders that have shocked the world.

2905
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:30,550
But we're not a blood cult, we're like a...

2906
02:38:33,950 --> 02:38:35,610
We are a vampire.

2907
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:38,110
Okay, we only have 12.

2908
02:38:38,230 --> 02:38:39,610
This is rough.

2909
02:38:40,770 --> 02:38:41,490
What the heck?

2910
02:38:41,870 --> 02:38:43,490
Blood to blood contact.

2911
02:38:43,850 --> 02:38:45,050
Genetic shift.

2912
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:46,310
Increases infectivity.

2913
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:48,770
Cross-species infection?

2914
02:38:49,490 --> 02:38:50,650
Okay, let's try that.

2915
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:54,510
Not in the dogs.

2916
02:38:55,730 --> 02:38:57,750
Oh my god, that's so sad.

2917
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:00,650
Handshake!

2918
02:39:01,790 --> 02:39:04,950
Survives outside the body, transmitted via external objects.

2919
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:09,810
People love to shake hands.

2920
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:12,870
They're totally going down.

2921
02:39:13,950 --> 02:39:15,050
Vampire dog.

2922
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:19,190
Weird ad.

2923
02:39:19,230 --> 02:39:20,070
What are you saying?

2924
02:39:20,970 --> 02:39:23,990
This cootie's infecting world domination stream is sponsored by...

2925
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:24,230
No!

2926
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:26,450
Wrong!

2927
02:39:26,830 --> 02:39:27,650
It's not!

2928
02:39:28,690 --> 02:39:30,290
Australia is tough, guys.

2929
02:39:31,470 --> 02:39:34,210
Australia maybe is not the perfect place for a vampire.

2930
02:39:36,490 --> 02:39:39,870
Maybe it's actually much tougher here than I thought for a vampire.

2931
02:39:50,010 --> 02:39:50,830
Um...

2932
02:39:54,650 --> 02:39:57,310
Literally we've infected...

2933
02:39:57,310 --> 02:39:58,370
Nothing else.

2934
02:39:58,450 --> 02:40:00,630
Oh, pheromone secretion.

2935
02:40:01,110 --> 02:40:03,810
Mutated and developed the pheromone secretion symptom.

2936
02:40:04,050 --> 02:40:05,330
What is that?

2937
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:07,110
Do you smell sexy?

2938
02:40:08,410 --> 02:40:09,210
Oh my god!

2939
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:14,910
Making victims more charismatic and able to easily manipulate, seduce others.

2940
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:20,520
No way!

2941
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:25,480
See, we don't have the photophobia yet.

2942
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:33,300
Almost all infected will die, but eventually...

2943
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:34,080
Oh yeah, that's right.

2944
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:37,600
We don't have enough for this.

2945
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:41,020
And also, I think it would be bad to kill off everybody.

2946
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:44,300
Riz pheromones.

2947
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:45,820
That's insane!

2948
02:40:45,820 --> 02:40:48,800
Is that why...

2949
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:52,740
Vampires are supposed to be so sexy and everything?

2950
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:55,320
They give off...

2951
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:57,820
They give off like a sexy...

2952
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:05,960
Charisma.

2953
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:09,820
We can get more...

2954
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:15,640
No, not here.

2955
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:17,100
Here, right?

2956
02:41:17,100 --> 02:41:18,580
I can't afford anything though.

2957
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:20,920
I can't afford anything.

2958
02:41:22,820 --> 02:41:24,940
Infection is quite slow.

2959
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:27,820
Oh wait, I'm also on slow time.

2960
02:41:28,300 --> 02:41:29,440
Now we're on fast time.

2961
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:33,660
My bad, I didn't realize we were on such slow time.

2962
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,820
We have to cover all of Australia.

2963
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:43,900
And then...

2964
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:47,080
You'd think that it would transmit eventually.

2965
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:49,540
Oh, let humanity discover your vampire.

2966
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:50,400
Oh shoot.

2967
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:56,160
Templar Industries reveals global vampire threat.

2968
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:58,120
Who the hell are you?

2969
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:01,040
Guys, I think it's over for us.

2970
02:42:01,700 --> 02:42:07,360
Secretive multinational defense company reveals that a vampire is behind the blood cult murders that have shocked the world.

2971
02:42:07,640 --> 02:42:08,820
Get inside your lair!

2972
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:12,380
Vigilantes in Australia fight vampire!

2973
02:42:12,860 --> 02:42:14,040
Who is a vigilante?

2974
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:19,660
Activate military protocols!

2975
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:22,540
They're coming for us.

2976
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:24,420
They're coming for us!

2977
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:28,440
How the hell do you beat this?

2978
02:42:29,220 --> 02:42:30,820
What if I...

2979
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:33,460
What's this?

2980
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:34,420
Dark pustule.

2981
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:37,040
Harder to cure.

2982
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:39,200
Zoom out.

2983
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:40,300
They have HQs.

2984
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:42,740
Oh my god.

2985
02:42:42,980 --> 02:42:43,500
They do.

2986
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:44,520
Oh my god.

2987
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:44,960
Attack!

2988
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,020
Kill!

2989
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:46,660
Attack!

2990
02:42:49,820 --> 02:42:50,980
I can't get there.

2991
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:53,940
Wait, what's this one do?

2992
02:42:58,190 --> 02:42:59,210
Create a lair.

2993
02:42:59,430 --> 02:43:00,830
Send the vampire to another country.

2994
02:43:00,950 --> 02:43:03,470
I can't do that one because we're too far away.

2995
02:43:04,530 --> 02:43:05,490
I can't.

2996
02:43:05,490 --> 02:43:09,110
Oh no.

2997
02:43:09,490 --> 02:43:10,870
Look at their bombing.

2998
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:15,740
They're trying to kill us off.

2999
02:43:19,300 --> 02:43:19,980
OK.

3000
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,320
Oh gosh.

3001
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:27,510
This one though...

3002
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:29,290
Attacks research facilities if present.

3003
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:32,350
Otherwise goes on killing spree.

3004
02:43:33,010 --> 02:43:34,210
I'm gonna go on a killing spree?

3005
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:39,790
Unknown disease.

3006
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:41,350
This is the freak virus.

3007
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:44,030
You're using it wrong.

3008
02:43:44,130 --> 02:43:45,210
I'm trying to...

3009
02:43:45,210 --> 02:43:50,110
I am not... This is my first... Well, this is my second time ever playing this one.

3010
02:43:50,990 --> 02:43:51,430
Drones!

3011
02:43:51,810 --> 02:43:52,370
Oh my god.

3012
02:43:52,390 --> 02:43:53,030
Not the lairs.

3013
02:43:53,150 --> 02:43:54,150
Wait, make a new lair!

3014
02:43:55,230 --> 02:43:55,870
We can't.

3015
02:43:58,410 --> 02:43:59,290
We can't.

3016
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:00,450
Oh, we're so done.

3017
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:01,690
Our lair...

3018
02:44:01,690 --> 02:44:02,250
Oh my god!

3019
02:44:02,350 --> 02:44:03,150
Heal in there!

3020
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:10,580
What did that one say about Iceland?

3021
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:12,640
I don't know.

3022
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:13,500
Templar.

3023
02:44:13,620 --> 02:44:14,020
Oh gosh.

3024
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:15,720
Freak virus placed on a watch list.

3025
02:44:16,220 --> 02:44:16,880
Good, good, good.

3026
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:19,800
We have 26 points.

3027
02:44:21,140 --> 02:44:21,600
Let's...

3028
02:44:25,900 --> 02:44:26,660
Let's see.

3029
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:33,940
Tens of thousands.

3030
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:35,920
We need more infections.

3031
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:37,360
You know?

3032
02:44:38,300 --> 02:44:39,940
Doubles the size of their wingspan.

3033
02:44:40,740 --> 02:44:44,080
When traveling vampire is able to instantly travel to... Oh, any lair.

3034
02:44:44,440 --> 02:44:45,400
Shoot, we don't have that yet.

3035
02:44:45,640 --> 02:44:50,120
Okay, let's do this and also maybe our wingspan.

3036
02:44:51,740 --> 02:44:52,340
Bat.

3037
02:44:52,780 --> 02:44:53,260
Fly.

3038
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:54,080
Fly?

3039
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:55,200
Bat.

3040
02:44:55,460 --> 02:44:55,800
Fly.

3041
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:57,020
Oh gosh.

3042
02:44:57,960 --> 02:44:58,640
Nevermind.

3043
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:03,540
I'm on a watch list.

3044
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:04,480
No, not me.

3045
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:06,520
Working to cure the freak virus.

3046
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:09,940
It's only... It's barely infected anybody.

3047
02:45:10,100 --> 02:45:11,460
Only 6 million people.

3048
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:14,240
Not even half of Australia has it.

3049
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:16,520
Come on, man.

3050
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,520
I have to select the vampire first.

3051
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:22,420
Hold on.

3052
02:45:22,800 --> 02:45:24,880
Wait, how do I select the vampire first?

3053
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:28,240
Oh, that's how it works!

3054
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:30,320
Oh my goodness gracious.

3055
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:34,560
That's how it works.

3056
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:36,840
Travel.

3057
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:39,440
Wait.

3058
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:44,420
Oh my gosh, we could have been traveling this whole time.

3059
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:48,480
Oh, sorry.

3060
02:45:48,900 --> 02:45:51,240
If you said, please don't...

3061
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:53,160
Now they won't know where we are.

3062
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:56,440
Oh.

3063
02:45:56,700 --> 02:45:57,280
La.

3064
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,140
La.

3065
02:45:58,480 --> 02:45:58,820
La.

3066
02:45:59,180 --> 02:46:00,360
More infection.

3067
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:01,240
La.

3068
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:01,980
Ha.

3069
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:02,740
La.

3070
02:46:03,220 --> 02:46:03,500
Yeah!

3071
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:05,680
We've left Australia!

3072
02:46:06,400 --> 02:46:07,420
Let's build a lair here.

3073
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:11,240
Let's build a lair everywhere, actually.

3074
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:16,100
Let's build a lair wherever we can go.

3075
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:19,820
They won't ever know where we're at.

3076
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:23,660
Wait.

3077
02:46:25,440 --> 02:46:26,480
They'll never know.

3078
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:29,820
Oh shoot, I missed the...

3079
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:30,880
Oh wait.

3080
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:32,580
I can't build.

3081
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:33,500
How many can I have?

3082
02:46:34,860 --> 02:46:36,680
Oh, it's 11 dollars.

3083
02:46:36,960 --> 02:46:37,520
Never mind.

3084
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:38,320
That's expensive.

3085
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:39,280
What?

3086
02:46:39,320 --> 02:46:40,500
It's a dollar per flight?

3087
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:42,180
Oh, I'm just wasting money.

3088
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:45,440
Stronger than USA!

3089
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:47,540
Oh no.

3090
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:53,160
Uh oh, some places have already shut down their airports.

3091
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:56,560
Wow!

3092
02:46:56,820 --> 02:46:57,560
Oh my god!

3093
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,080
They blew up my lair.

3094
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:03,880
Lair destroyed in New Zealand!

3095
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:05,360
No!

3096
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:08,760
It's okay, people are still getting infected.

3097
02:47:13,860 --> 02:47:16,060
Oh gosh, I forgot about the cure.

3098
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:17,540
This one is so tricky.

3099
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:19,540
This one is hard.

3100
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:22,660
Now I know how to travel and stuff.

3101
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:24,680
Let's see.

3102
02:47:26,620 --> 02:47:27,220
Vampire...

3103
02:47:27,220 --> 02:47:28,800
How do I scramble it?

3104
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:32,060
Slightly harder to cure.

3105
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:35,440
I don't remember how to scramble.

3106
02:47:38,200 --> 02:47:38,800
Shoot.

3107
02:47:39,220 --> 02:47:40,100
It plays so differently.

3108
02:47:40,260 --> 02:47:41,320
It really does.

3109
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:42,540
You have to be...

3110
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:44,040
So...

3111
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:47,420
Who lab close to developing cure for freak virus?

3112
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:48,560
Oh gosh.

3113
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,240
Attack this place?

3114
02:47:51,860 --> 02:47:52,020
Wait.

3115
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:53,900
Yeah!

3116
02:47:55,580 --> 02:47:57,060
Oh my gosh!

3117
02:47:57,360 --> 02:47:59,500
It's so strange.

3118
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:01,760
Lab in China destroyed by vampire!

3119
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:04,820
And I'm gonna set up my lair here too.

3120
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:04,880
No.

3121
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:12,900
Wait, how does a vampire laugh?

3122
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:31,180
Sexily and scarily.

3123
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:32,640
Do I sound sexy?

3124
02:48:41,130 --> 02:48:43,330
Am I sounding sexy?

3125
02:48:43,990 --> 02:48:44,550
Oh gosh.

3126
02:48:44,890 --> 02:48:47,470
Cures poison vampire in China.

3127
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:47,850
Oops.

3128
02:48:49,230 --> 02:48:49,790
Goodbye.

3129
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:54,930
Everybody is dead in Australia?

3130
02:48:55,150 --> 02:48:56,310
No, that's not possible.

3131
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:58,310
Vampire slain in China!

3132
02:48:58,470 --> 02:48:59,070
Wait, that's me.

3133
02:49:00,350 --> 02:49:01,490
I'm the vampire!

3134
02:49:09,170 --> 02:49:09,930
No!

3135
02:49:09,930 --> 02:49:11,090
That's me!

3136
02:49:11,750 --> 02:49:12,490
Vampire!

3137
02:49:21,970 --> 02:49:24,610
We had not good run.

3138
02:49:25,510 --> 02:49:26,830
Your laugh sounds very cute.

3139
02:49:27,150 --> 02:49:27,950
Thank you!

3140
02:49:30,790 --> 02:49:32,490
This is so goofy guys.

3141
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:36,970
We spread the brain rot.

3142
02:49:37,330 --> 02:49:38,910
We spread fox die.

3143
02:49:38,910 --> 02:49:41,730
We spread Chovek die.

3144
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:47,030
We spread freak virus, but only one prevailed.

3145
02:49:49,110 --> 02:49:51,090
Now you can try with abilities from the start.

3146
02:49:51,170 --> 02:49:51,610
No way.

3147
02:49:56,670 --> 02:49:58,390
No, I have nothing unlocked.

3148
02:49:59,630 --> 02:50:00,070
Unless...

3149
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:00,590
I don't know.

3150
02:50:02,270 --> 02:50:03,090
It's okay though.

3151
02:50:03,230 --> 02:50:03,990
Maybe another time.

3152
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:05,270
This was fine.

3153
02:50:05,630 --> 02:50:06,270
I had a good time.

3154
02:50:06,330 --> 02:50:08,610
I hope you guys had a good time with this silly game.

3155
02:50:12,270 --> 02:50:13,270
And yeah.

3156
02:50:15,570 --> 02:50:17,810
Mint is too nice to spread plagues?

3157
02:50:18,230 --> 02:50:18,790
Oh yeah?

3158
02:50:19,390 --> 02:50:20,810
Get real close.

3159
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:22,570
Get real close to your screen.

3160
02:50:23,930 --> 02:50:25,830
Get real close to your screen.

3161
02:50:26,050 --> 02:50:27,110
Get really close.

3162
02:50:27,350 --> 02:50:31,250
Get as close as you can to the screen.

3163
02:50:31,710 --> 02:50:33,490
Get really really close.

3164
02:50:33,810 --> 02:50:35,270
Get as close as you can.

3165
02:50:35,910 --> 02:50:37,090
I'll get even closer.

3166
02:50:37,510 --> 02:50:39,130
Get really really close.

3167
02:50:39,210 --> 02:50:39,370
Ready?

3168
02:50:41,910 --> 02:50:42,530
Ready?

3169
02:50:42,870 --> 02:50:43,010
Ready?

3170
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:03,660
I spread freak virus to you!

3171
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:09,640
You have been infected with the freak.

3172
02:51:10,940 --> 02:51:12,360
Down with the sickness?

3173
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:13,360
No, no, no.

3174
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:14,760
Down with the freakness.

3175
02:51:18,980 --> 02:51:20,660
You missed...

3176
02:51:30,190 --> 02:51:34,550
Have a freaky night and freaky dreams!

3177
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:46,460
Thank you!

3178
02:51:46,600 --> 02:51:46,680
Thank you!

3179
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:47,180
Thank you!

3180
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:48,100
Bye bye!

3181
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:48,500
Bye bye!

3182
02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:50,600
Bye bye!

3183
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:53,120
You

3184
02:52:17,050 --> 02:52:18,390
guys want to see something funny?

3185
02:52:21,410 --> 02:52:23,890
My glasses have more jiggle physics than me.

3186
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:03,820
Oh yes, yes, yes!
