1
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,960
Punga Punga Manchun, Punga Manchun...

2
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,120
Welcome home, master and lady.

3
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,920
Today...

4
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,720
I would like to play baseball.

5
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,220
Why in Japanese?

6
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
Why Japanese?

7
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,560
Today, I want to play...

8
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Kumanopu-san's homerun...

9
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,580
TABIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

10
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,920
Japanese, why?

11
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,400
I don't know!

12
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,860
Oh gosh, my voice is...

13
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,520
I had to sing a bunch of stuff today.

14
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,020
My voice is so like...

15
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,500
Chibi-minto kawaii!

16
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,280
Arigatou!

17
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,060
I can't wink.

18
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,620
It's my birthday and I'm sick so thank you for streaming!

19
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,240
Kiera!

20
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,440
Happy birthday!

21
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,540
Happy birthday to you!

22
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,720
Happy birthday to you!

23
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,020
Happy birthday dear Kiera!

24
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,020
Happy birthday to you!

25
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,620
And feel better!

26
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,660
Oh my gosh.

27
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,600
I had to turn the music down way low so I can barely hear the donuts.

28
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,360
I'm so sorry.

29
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
There's no God.

30
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,420
Only Christopher Robin.

31
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,770
Christopher Robin.

32
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,130
This game has been living rent free in my brain for so many years.

33
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,650
I tried to play it in heaven too actually.

34
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,050
I wanted to play it the first week I got to heaven.

35
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,890
But Disney!

36
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,270
But I'm indie!

37
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,510
So I don't care about Disney.

38
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,810
Well I care a little bit about Disney.

39
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,890
Hope you have a great day and Kumano Pusan is not a cause of...

40
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,210
Why are you a hater Anton?

41
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,470
Why are you a hater Anton?

42
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:36,850
I'm not a hater.

43
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,510
Disney does not mess around.

44
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,710
No they don't.

45
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,010
But yeah, we're just gonna start.

46
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,630
So...

47
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,510
I know that there's like a power up.

48
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,290
Like you can power up your stuff.

49
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,870
There's power, meat and speed.

50
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,170
We gotta be meatier.

51
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,110
My birthday is this Saturday.

52
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,690
Can I have an early MGS5?

53
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,770
Happy birthday from Akavius.

54
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,610
Happy birthday.

55
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,270
Congratulations.

56
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,950
Happy birthday with salutations.

57
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,790
Happy birthday.

58
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,330
May your skies stay blue.

59
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,070
Happy birthday to you.

60
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,310
PP Paladin.

61
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,450
Happy birthday!

62
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,970
Are we ready to start everybody?

63
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,570
I think we should just start.

64
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,830
Power to make the ball fly.

65
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,570
Meat to make the ball hit.

66
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,490
The bat easier.

67
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:43,750
That's what it means.

68
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,770
Like meat the bat, right?

69
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,430
The last to stream to surpass the Yomowari final boss fight.

70
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,750
I want to eat Hachimizu.

71
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,870
Hachimizu is delicious.

72
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,030
Silly old maid.

73
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,990
If the harbinger of spring is the sound of a bat on a ball...

74
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,590
Then I have become the harbinger of winter.

75
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,250
Christopher Robin.

76
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,270
Oh my god.

77
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,150
It starts so fast.

78
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,450
Don't worry about it.

79
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,710
So basically we have...

80
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,550
Eight...

81
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,090
Hold on.

82
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,010
I'm trying to explain the game.

83
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,550
Oh my gosh.

84
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,210
Hold on, Eeyore.

85
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,210
You have seven balls.

86
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,950
And I have to get three home runs, you guys.

87
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,910
Oh my gosh.

88
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,530
Wait a second.

89
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,590
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

90
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,630
Eeyore, please.

91
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,990
Why am I only getting fouls?

92
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,360
You guys, this is a warm up.

93
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,200
This is a warm up.

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,060
That's an example of a home run.

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,340
It's okay.

96
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,380
Do you understand how to play the game now?

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,700
If you're fouling off pitches, that means hitting the ball.

98
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,380
You just have to adjust your timing.

99
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,460
Okay.

100
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,300
Andregos, thanks for the 10 gifted.

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,200
Oh.

102
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,160
Oh.

103
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:28,860
Okay.

104
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm too... I'm too early.

105
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,040
Tire Robin onto your team.

106
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,220
Nice!

107
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
Actually, it took me...

108
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,180
I... I...

109
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,260
Not to say that I practiced, but I...

110
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,160
No!

111
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,000
Foul!

112
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,460
I...

113
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,060
I didn't realize you have to like really kind of hold the bat, you know?

114
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,920
You have to click it down with firmness.

115
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
You have to like...

116
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,880
Firmly...

117
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
Like you can't just...

118
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,260
You know?

119
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,180
You can't just click.

120
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,640
You have to...

121
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,680
Oh my gosh.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,580
You have to like firmly...

123
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:07,920
Really...

124
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,660
What?

125
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,560
No!

126
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:10,740
No!

127
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,820
That was only a hit!

128
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,420
Oh golly.

129
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,260
Please.

130
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,640
Please.

131
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,540
It's a hit.

132
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
You have to firmly...

133
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,120
You want help?

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,600
No.

135
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,060
Why would I want help?

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,700
Firmly grasp the bat.

137
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,490
You guys can hear my cough drop, can't you?

138
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,070
Hear my cough drop, can't you?

139
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,930
Can you hear my cough drop?

140
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,510
Oh gosh.

141
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,510
Oh no!

142
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,690
You can't?

143
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,250
Oh, good.

144
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,310
Oh god!

145
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,430
Oh, I'm a foul!

146
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,230
That's a home run.

147
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,010
Yeah!

148
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,270
Cough drop ASMR.

149
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,690
I'll be probably guzzling these babies down.

150
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,050
Probably guzzling these babies.

151
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,090
Oh, foul.

152
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,190
But if we get more stuff...

153
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,150
Oh, whoops, my bad.

154
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,010
If we get more bonus points, we can add...

155
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,890
We can enhance our skills.

156
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,810
You're foul.

157
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,490
You're foul!

158
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,950
Oh, whoops, my bad.

159
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,770
I wasn't paying attention.

160
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,670
Oh, there's one more.

161
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,390
You aren't supposed to use upgrades.

162
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,390
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,470
My Kamiyoshi Pikami used upgrades?

164
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,610
I will use upgrades too.

165
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,970
Shut the hell up.

166
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,750
What is this guy's name?

167
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,230
Rumpy?

168
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,650
Oh my god.

169
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,650
Is that a fowl?

170
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,430
What's his name?

171
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,290
Eeyore's down.

172
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,090
I think that's just a hit.

173
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,850
I've literally never seen this one before.

174
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:21,710
Oh god.

175
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:22,670
Oh!

176
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,810
I think that counts!

177
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,870
Wow, 139.

178
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,950
Okay, let's go.

179
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,310
I'm killing it.

180
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,830
Let's go.

181
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,310
I've never seen this man in my life.

182
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,130
There's like... Oh, that's just a hit.

183
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,610
There's like a... They're from the movie.

184
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,530
Yeah, there's like a bunch of Heffalumps, I think.

185
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,210
They're called, right?

186
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,030
There's like the guys that are... Oh, shoot.

187
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,710
Minto playing peek.

188
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:51,810
Oh.

189
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,050
Yeah, there's like a Heffalumps.

190
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,430
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

191
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,450
Oh wait, maybe.

192
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,950
There's still five left.

193
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,270
Let's have faith.

194
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,370
Okay, if you throw it that close to me, are you trying to kill me?

195
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,750
This guy is trying to murder me.

196
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,870
This is Kingdom Hearts 4.

197
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,410
Yeah.

198
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,770
Oh, please!

199
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,870
Why is that a foul?

200
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,150
Please make it.

201
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,330
Oh!

202
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,250
Oh!

203
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,310
Oh!

204
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,580
I love baseball!

205
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
The clutch.

206
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,360
Piglet.

207
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,800
Pigleto.

208
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,180
We have to...

209
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,700
We have to hit eight.

210
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,340
Oh my god, he's fast.

211
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,840
What does he do?

212
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,800
He jumps and...

213
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,520
Oh, gosh.

214
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,860
Why does he look so smug over there?

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,300
Oh, god.

216
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,460
Oh my god, Piglet.

217
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,900
Oops.

218
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,320
See his kid degrees, baby.

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,680
Oh, god.

220
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,080
He spikes it.

221
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,340
Oh, it's just a hit.

222
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,600
Why is he so smug about it?

223
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,600
Please be a homerun.

224
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,460
Foul.

225
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,540
Guys, that's fine.

226
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,760
Oh, okay.

227
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,450
I don't think this is a curveball.

228
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:42,830
Oh!

229
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,790
Wow, that counted.

230
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,770
Okay, let's go.

231
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,170
He's so fast.

232
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,530
Oh, shoot.

233
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,090
Okay, that was too off.

234
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:50,650
Oh!

235
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:59,210
I made sponsor the Winnie the Pooh baseball team.

236
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,490
I'm trying to...

237
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,710
My team is at a disadvantage.

238
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,390
We have this really hungry guy, okay?

239
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,550
Oh, gosh.

240
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,430
Oh, no, I'm not going to make it.

241
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,290
I'm not going to make it.

242
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,110
Wait, am I?

243
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:16,830
Hold on.

244
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,550
No.

245
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,830
Oh, no.

246
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,590
I got confident.

247
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,090
We have a really hungry...

248
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,030
Oh, why did I...

249
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,910
Why did I do that?

250
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,370
Hold on.

251
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,530
Stop sending me super chats.

252
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,130
Oh, stop sending me super chats.

253
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,310
It's so Jover.

254
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,870
I said I might make it and I immediately missed every single one from there.

255
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,240
I couldn't donate on your anniversary, but I just want to say you made me laugh in moments.

256
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,860
I really needed it.

257
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,580
Oh, Peachy, thank you.

258
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,780
Pooh's Heffalump movie.

259
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,140
When Roo sets off on his own 100-acre woods, he discovers a friendly and helpful heffalump named Lumpy.

260
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,840
Oh.

261
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,940
Your feet have to be in contact with the mound.

262
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,560
Yeah, where's the ump?

263
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,460
Send more super chats now.

264
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,520
Pigletto.

265
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,880
Okay, we got this.

266
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,520
Come here, Piglet.

267
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Oh, God.

268
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,900
The first one is so fast.

269
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,900
He's trying to kill me.

270
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,220
He's trying to kill me.

271
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
He's like, I'm sick of...

272
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh, gosh.

273
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,700
He says, I'm sick of this Pooh Bear.

274
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,220
This Pooh Bear who's hungry for...

275
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,080
Oh, my God.

276
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,020
It was so close.

277
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,020
All he wants is honey.

278
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Both distracting and free.

279
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,280
Nice.

280
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,880
Trying to take my head off.

281
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,420
That's what I'm saying.

282
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,740
Oh.

283
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,720
I wonder what my highest is.

284
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh, my God.

285
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
Why is it so fast?

286
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,120
Piglet.

287
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,420
Piglet.

288
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,700
Piglet.

289
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,400
Piglet.

290
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,120
Piglet.

291
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,200
Piglet.

292
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,380
Piglet.

293
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,740
Piglet.

294
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:16,840
Piglet.

295
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,640
Piglet.

296
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:18,940
Piglet.

297
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,660
Come on.

298
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,880
Come on.

299
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,080
That was not a foul.

300
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,900
That...

301
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,600
Ref.

302
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,980
Where's the referee?

303
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,660
No.

304
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,280
That was a foul.

305
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,640
Where's the referee?

306
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,820
Where's the umpire to call that one?

307
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,100
That one was in.

308
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,380
Let's go.

309
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Thank you.

310
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,140
I think this is it.

311
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,360
Okay.

312
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,860
Nice.

313
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,980
Please stay in.

314
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Yeah, baby!

315
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,240
Boo-hee!

316
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,460
I wonder what my longest distance is.

317
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,560
Boo-hee!

318
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,650
Nice.

319
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,590
Free Supas!

320
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,430
Hit it out of the park!

321
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,410
Thanks, Jack!

322
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,770
You can never be around cause busy, but I love you, desu.

323
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,510
Thank you, desu!

324
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,930
Piglet is also refereeing.

325
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,510
Hmm-hmm!

326
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,870
Good job, guys.

327
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,030
No Supa, but Streamlabs is okay, right?

328
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,550
I can barely hear it though.

329
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,530
Because I had to turn down this music so much.

330
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,150
Oh boy.

331
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,950
Kenga time.

332
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:07,730
Okay.

333
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,850
Those are just warm-up rounds, right?

334
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,470
Kenga and Ruru.

335
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,470
I used to love Ruru.

336
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,010
For anyone more curious...

337
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,530
Oh my god.

338
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,110
Um...

339
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,170
Holy moly!

340
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,070
I'm cracked.

341
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,150
142?

342
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,610
I think that's my longest.

343
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,790
Oh, okay.

344
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,370
Um...

345
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,370
Uh...

346
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,210
The first is how many balls they have.

347
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,650
The second one is how many home runs I have.

348
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,470
And the third is how many balls are left.

349
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,510
Oh, no!

350
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:36,790
Sorry.

351
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,930
The first one is my goal.

352
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,310
How many home runs I need to get.

353
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,370
I need 12 home runs.

354
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,330
Oh!

355
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,340
Oh my god.

356
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,020
That was unfair.

357
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,800
That was unfair.

358
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,200
Okay.

359
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,420
It's not...

360
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,340
Hits don't count.

361
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,420
Which is such...

362
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,800
They should count for half of something.

363
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,800
They should count for half.

364
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,820
I swear.

365
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,940
Oh god.

366
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,540
Okay.

367
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,280
Four?

368
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,740
It's a home run derby.

369
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,640
Not a hit derby.

370
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:21,860
Oops.

371
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,540
You're right.

372
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,000
That was a foul.

373
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,140
It's all...

374
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,200
The hits should still be like...

375
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Half or something.

376
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,020
Right?

377
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,560
You should get half a point.

378
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,880
And then if I get two hits...

379
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,600
I get...

380
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,460
Oh, dang it.

381
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,640
Do you have a super chat?

382
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,500
Thank you.

383
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,060
I can't read the whole thing right now.

384
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,340
Hold on.

385
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,240
Oh.

386
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,040
Oh.

387
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,720
Oh.

388
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay.

389
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,140
Okay.

390
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,380
Okay.

391
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,600
Okay.

392
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,620
Oh.

393
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,740
That's a foul, isn't it?

394
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,210
Why...

395
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,650
When it's so slow...

396
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,650
It's hard to count.

397
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,050
When it's so slow, it's hard to count.

398
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:12,650
Okay.

399
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,230
Nine.

400
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,090
Oh, gosh.

401
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,810
Oh, gosh.

402
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,150
Oh, gosh.

403
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:17,270
Oh, gosh.

404
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,390
Oh, gosh.

405
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,310
Oh, my God.

406
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,210
Oh, this is going to be so...

407
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,570
Oh, my God.

408
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:21,650
Uh oh.

409
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:21,930
Ah ha ha!

410
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,750
You guys, I don't think I'm going to make it.

411
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,810
There's only three balls left.

412
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,710
Alright.

413
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,230
I got so far.

414
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,850
I got so far.

415
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,080
I got so far.

416
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,020
Tonight.

417
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,660
I got so far.

418
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,060
I got so far.

419
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,240
Tonight.

420
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,180
Nice!

421
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,920
Good start!

422
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,100
Good start!

423
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,540
Good start!

424
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:08,380
It doesn't even matter, I had to fall to lose it all.

425
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,720
But in the end, it doesn't even matter.

426
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,720
142!

427
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,720
What if I don't want to upgrade?

428
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,660
Stop spamming!

429
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,300
Don't backseat!

430
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,180
No backseating, you guys.

431
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,180
I'll upgrade when I feel like it.

432
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,560
Oh my god!

433
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,460
Oh my god!

434
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,440
I wouldn't have homerun that one anyway.

435
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,740
Strike three!

436
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,680
You're out of the park!

437
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,500
Can

438
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,270
I passenger seat instead?

439
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,830
What sounds do kangaroos make?

440
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,870
Oh, I think that's not in.iii!

441
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:10,490
Ehem.

442
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,310
The sound, boxing sounds, they like... No, they have to make a sound.

443
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,630
Oh, dang it.

444
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,930
They probably like...

445
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,950
Oh gosh, they probably like squeak or something, right?

446
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,770
Oh my god, oh no no no no, here's where it happens!

447
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,370
Oh god.

448
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,530
They probably be like...

449
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,150
Nice.

450
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,640
Ten?

451
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,060
Alright, alright, two more, two more, two more.

452
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,130
Oh gosh!

453
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,670
Okay, one more!

454
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,420
We got it guys, we got it.

455
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,380
Maybe I'm secretly a genius at this game.

456
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,700
I say as I strike.

457
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,580
Oh, I forgot the rabbit's name.

458
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,510
Oh, it's just rabbit.

459
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,010
Rabbit!

460
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,650
You're overthinking it.

461
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,830
Huh?

462
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,730
How do you do that?

463
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,430
He controls time and...

464
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,470
Oh my god, my bad.

465
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,790
He controls time and space!

466
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,410
Wait!

467
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:14,750
Wait!

468
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:19,190
He controls... I need to get 15 overrides, I can't even get a single hit in!

469
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,410
Oh my god, wait.

470
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,310
Oh no!

471
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,870
Oh my god, wait.

472
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,450
Rabbit!

473
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,270
Rabbit!

474
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,910
Rabbit!

475
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,390
It's actually... it was my fault.

476
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,810
Remember how I said you have to like really... you have to commit to the... to the press?

477
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,390
It was my fault.

478
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,610
I wasn't committing to the press.

479
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,830
I wasn't committing to the press!

480
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,430
Well, that's a foul.

481
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,650
It was my fault.

482
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,390
It was my fault.

483
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,410
Say yes to the press.

484
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,030
The world!

485
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,410
Please, please, please.

486
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,210
Please, please, please.

487
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,530
Don't prove I'm wrong.

488
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,010
Please, please, please, please.

489
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,550
Nice.

490
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,210
Press, press, press, press.

491
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,070
Press!

492
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,970
A foul.

493
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,970
A foul.

494
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,250
I'm spitting out of fear and it's like getting on my monitor.

495
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,510
I'm like...

496
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,270
Oh.

497
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,350
Just kidding.

498
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,010
Maybe that'll be it.

499
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,310
Nice.

500
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,790
I'm like...

501
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,550
All over my monitor.

502
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,800
Okay.

503
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,100
Okay.

504
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,320
Okay.

505
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,700
Chat, I expected better of you.

506
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,420
Really?

507
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,760
Really?

508
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,620
Really?

509
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,440
Really?

510
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,500
Okay.

511
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,480
Ten?

512
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,020
We got seven left.

513
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
We need five more.

514
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,120
Don't mess this up, Minto.

515
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,180
Oh, gosh, Minto.

516
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,200
Uh-oh.

517
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,920
Uh-oh.

518
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,300
Uh-oh.

519
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,640
Uh-oh.

520
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,380
Uh-oh.

521
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,600
Uh-oh.

522
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:34,960
Uh-oh.

523
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,080
Uh-oh.

524
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,280
Uh-oh.

525
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,660
Uh -oh.

526
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:35,780
Uh -oh.

527
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,140
Uh -oh.

528
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,780
Uh -oh.

529
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,340
Perfectly.

530
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

531
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,340
I work better under pressure, baby.

532
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,400
No way.

533
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,760
No way, no way.

534
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,410
We were so close.

535
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,630
I was so close.

536
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,450
I was so close.

537
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,430
Okay, but I know his game now.

538
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,050
Kind of.

539
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,470
A little more!

540
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,870
Send

541
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,880
me your strength.

542
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,340
That's just a hit.

543
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,320
Hit!

544
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,420
Nice.

545
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,140
It was the ping!

546
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,720
It was the ping!

547
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,310
Send me your energy!

548
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,750
Spirit bomb!

549
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:26,390
Okay, you didn't send that much energy because that was really close to not being a home run.

550
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,090
Actually, Rabbids is not so bad usually.

551
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,070
I say as I don't make it.

552
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,870
But I at least hit it, you know?

553
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
That is a hit.

554
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,220
Oh no.

555
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,560
Oh no, no, no.

556
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,300
I still need ten more.

557
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,240
Nine more.

558
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,220
Rabbit, it's rabbit hunting season.

559
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,540
Okay, maybe I shouldn't taunt the rabbit.

560
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,620
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

561
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,500
Oh no, oh no, no, no, oh no.

562
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Wait, I'm the batter.

563
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,520
Oh wait, wait, wait.

564
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,040
I misclicked.

565
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,680
Oh no.

566
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,820
Hey, batter, batter, batter.

567
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,820
Hey, batter, swing!

568
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,020
Batter, batter, batter.

569
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,920
Nice.

570
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,000
Some of the slow ones are really stressful, I'm not gonna lie.

571
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,800
Nice.

572
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,440
Hey, pitcher, pitcher.

573
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,440
Hey, pitcher.

574
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,900
Hey, pitcher.

575
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,960
Hey, pitcher, you pitcher of water.

576
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,240
Hey, pitcher.

577
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,280
Okay.

578
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,380
Hey, pitcher.

579
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,600
Oh no.

580
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,220
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

581
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,240
I still need six more.

582
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,220
Uh-oh.

583
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,000
I need home runs.

584
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,840
Home runs, baby.

585
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,740
Home run derby.

586
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,320
Hit or miss?

587
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,920
I guess they never miss.

588
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,780
No!

589
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,020
Please!

590
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,820
Please, that wasn't a foul.

591
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:04,780
Please!

592
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,740
Oh, rabbit, please!

593
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,120
I still need five more.

594
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,160
No!

595
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,520
Oh!

596
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,640
Oh my gosh!

597
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,220
Oh gosh.

598
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,740
Oh-oh.

599
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,760
Oh, gosh.

600
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,640
It's only fouls.

601
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,420
It's only fouls.

602
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,740
Okay.

603
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:16,940
Nice.

604
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,160
Nice.

605
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,320
Nice.

606
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:18,740
Okay.

607
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,300
Just come back.

608
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,500
I'm choking.

609
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm choking.

610
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,940
I'm choking.

611
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,640
I'm choking.

612
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,660
No!

613
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm choking.

614
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,180
I'm choking.

615
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,440
I'm choking.

616
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm choking.

617
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,240
I'm choking.

618
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,360
Okay.

619
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,060
Three.

620
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,380
Three left.

621
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,110
Two left.

622
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,190
Two left.

623
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,990
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

624
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,230
Okay.

625
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,370
Two left, two left, two left, two left, two left.

626
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,110
That was 142.7!

627
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,190
Thank you for the super chat.

628
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:54,770
No!

629
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,090
No!

630
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,130
Wait, wait, wait!

631
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,050
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

632
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,010
Please, not again.

633
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,210
It wasn't even a home run.

634
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,310
It wasn't even a home run.

635
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,010
You're gonna regret going through this if you haven't already.

636
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,890
Two, I can't believe the first thing that came to my mind seeing this is the Pooh horror movie.

637
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,150
I'm not regretting anything.

638
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,950
So close each time!

639
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,410
So close each... Foul!

640
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,700
Believe in yourself as a gamer.

641
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,280
Believe in yourself as a gamer.

642
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,780
Oops.

643
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,480
Oh, I didn't commit to the... That was my fault.

644
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,770
Believe in yourself as a gamer.

645
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,720
The fouls are gonna mess me up, man.

646
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,300
Nice.

647
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,380
Mr. Instincts.

648
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,100
As a gamer.

649
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,210
We're hitting?

650
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,750
Oops.

651
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,610
Oops.

652
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,330
Oops.

653
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,770
Our stats are not looking...

654
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,350
143!

655
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,350
Our stats are not looking...

656
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,330
Oh, so great right now.

657
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,250
It's just a hit.

658
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,870
But you know...

659
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,310
Every Shonen protagonist...

660
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,090
Has...

661
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,110
A recovery...

662
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,070
ARK!

663
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,630
Oh, dang it.

664
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,030
Oh, no.

665
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,880
I have to be really locked in now.

666
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,070
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make this one either.

667
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,530
I think we're...

668
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,330
I think Rabbit's gonna...

669
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,650
Filter us.

670
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:30,790
Guys!

671
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,990
Guys!

672
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,550
Guys!

673
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,910
Guys!

674
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,250
Guys!

675
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:48,730
Nice.

676
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,490
Wow!

677
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:51,670
That one's...

678
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,010
That one seems pretty far.

679
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,110
Please, please, please, please!

680
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,000
Nope.

681
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,960
Guys, it's so over for us.

682
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,780
I'd have to hit every single one.

683
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,860
I'd have to...

684
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,600
I'd have to do every single one, please.

685
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,240
Oh!

686
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:12,320
Oh!

687
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,300
Nope.

688
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,340
That's it.

689
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:17,960
That's it.

690
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,990
How close will I get though?

691
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,510
Oh, that's a foul.

692
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,550
So the foul is timing and not like the placement of my bat?

693
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,590
I don't understand that.

694
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,760
It's both.

695
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,580
Oops.

696
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,200
Hey, bada-bada-ba.

697
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,840
Swing!

698
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,380
Bada-bada-ba.

699
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,640
Hey, bada-bada-ba.

700
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,820
That's okay.

701
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,520
It's okay.

702
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,300
We get close every time.

703
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,640
We get close every time.

704
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,920
How many stages are there?

705
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,400
I don't remember.

706
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,020
This is a Flash game, actually.

707
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,500
Oh.

708
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,060
Eight stages.

709
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,460
Okay.

710
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,860
Does that include Christopher Robin?

711
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,380
Isn't he a special stage?

712
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,480
Okay.

713
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,040
Oh, no, no, no.

714
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,220
3 after Rabbit.

715
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,320
What the?

716
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,770
He's number 8?

717
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,010
Okay.

718
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
Please, please, please.

719
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,220
Yes!

720
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,240
Why is it so slow?

721
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,660
Oh please, please.

722
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,460
Nice.

723
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,560
Lock in, Minto.

724
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,060
Locked in.

725
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,760
No!

726
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,480
Please.

727
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,120
Nice.

728
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,480
Yeah.

729
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,800
I'm locked in.

730
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,440
Oh!

731
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeah!

732
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,140
I

733
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,230
already know that their upgrades exist.

734
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,570
Oh

735
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,160
come on!

736
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,140
That was your fault, Rabbit.

737
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,380
That was your fault.

738
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,600
It was so slow.

739
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,180
So slow.

740
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,460
Oh come on.

741
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,640
Okay.

742
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,270
6 more.

743
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,350
5 more.

744
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,060
Dang it.

745
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,340
Okay.

746
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,900
Please, please, please.

747
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,340
6 shots.

748
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,280
Nice.

749
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,900
Sometimes I can't tell though.

750
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,380
Sometimes they move so slowly.

751
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Oh no!

752
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,940
There's very little room for error here.

753
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,980
Okay, okay, okay.

754
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,120
I wonder even how many points I have.

755
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,740
What do you do?

756
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:48,900
Here?

757
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,080
Wait.

758
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,700
Actually, where do I do the...

759
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,500
Wait.

760
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,340
Where do I do the upgrade?

761
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:54,580
Oh.

762
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,140
Oh, status.

763
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,580
Oh.

764
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,220
My bad.

765
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,940
I thought it said stage.

766
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:58,940
Whoa!

767
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,740
I have a ton of points!

768
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,560
Stage.

769
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,180
Select.

770
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,300
Mr. Owl.

771
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,940
Okay, I need...

772
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,360
Oh!

773
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,180
Okay, I need 19.

774
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,600
Okay.

775
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh my god.

776
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,180
Okay.

777
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,760
Oh gosh.

778
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,920
Wait, do I have to have...

779
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,960
Do I have to have power?

780
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,260
Oh god.

781
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,700
What?

782
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,260
Do I have to have more power up?

783
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,860
Oh I'm not... I'm hitting but I'm not getting any...

784
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,400
Oh no, no, no.

785
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,060
Uh oh.

786
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:46,930
Oh!

787
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,370
Nice!

788
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,930
I beat him without upgrades?

789
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,310
Okay.

790
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,390
Show off.

791
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:56,790
Chill!

792
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,500
Tip of the bat equals... Yeah, yeah.

793
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,120
I know, I know.

794
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,160
I know.

795
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm trying to get it in the green.

796
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,820
You know?

797
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,460
Wait, who was standing behind Pooh?

798
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,800
Who was standing behind Pooh Bear?

799
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,720
Is that me?

800
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,420
Oh, it's a fowl.

801
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,620
He was downgrades.

802
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,400
Wait, is it Gopher?

803
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:21,920
I think.

804
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,380
I think it's Gopher.

805
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,220
I used to love his whistliness.

806
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,280
I'm Gopher.

807
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,820
Uh oh.

808
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,700
There's no way this is happening.

809
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,020
How the hell?

810
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,060
Oh, nice.

811
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,320
Okay, we really have to get it on the tip.

812
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,780
We really have to get it on the tip.

813
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,080
Oh.

814
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,960
Or a strike.

815
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,460
Or a strike.

816
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:54,920
Two.

817
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,700
Or a strike.

818
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,960
Okay.

819
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,240
Oh, even that though was just a hit.

820
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Oh my god.

821
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,860
Oh, that one was good.

822
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,440
That one was good.

823
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,600
That one was mighty.

824
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,400
Who the hell is Gopher?

825
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,060
That's not his name?

826
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,560
Wait, is his name not Gopher?

827
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,420
That's not his name?

828
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Wait, is his name not Gopher?

829
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,540
We're not gonna make it.

830
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,540
But, it's good to get some practice.

831
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,500
He has already figured out...

832
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,620
Wait, what?

833
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,040
What does that say?

834
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,320
Hold on.

835
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,000
Wait a second.

836
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,240
Oh.

837
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,400
Oh.

838
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Why is it so close to me?

839
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,780
How do you throw it like this?

840
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,120
How do you actually throw it like this?

841
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,020
What's wrong with you?

842
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,760
What's in this ball, you cheater?

843
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,620
I'm not doing so bad though actually with this.

844
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,740
Dang, if I hadn't messed up in the very beginning, I would have been done...

845
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,760
I would have been pretty good.

846
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,900
Oh, just kidding.

847
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,040
Just kidding.

848
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,360
This guy's a cheater.

849
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,400
Wait till Tigger.

850
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,360
I'm scared.

851
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,080
I don't remember how Tigger's pitching is at all.

852
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,140
I don't remember.

853
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,470
Okay, we got to 12.

854
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,410
Oh, 11.

855
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,770
Sorry.

856
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,170
I'm getting ahead of myself.

857
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,550
We got to 12.

858
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,230
This is not pre-recorded.

859
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,950
This is not pre-recorded.

860
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,550
Oh my god.

861
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,190
Pre-recorded.

862
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:00,270
Pre-recorded.

863
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:00,530
Nooooo!

864
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,590
No, no, no, no, no, no.

865
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,470
No, no.

866
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,150
You guys, give me one second.

867
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,210
You're gonna have to listen to this horrifying music.

868
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,030
I'm gonna grab food really quickly.

869
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,530
Actually, hold on.

870
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,390
I'll put on my own music.

871
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:15,290
Sorry.

872
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,230
Sorry.

873
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,230
I suddenly started to get so hungry.

874
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,770
I'm gonna... Sorry.

875
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,390
I suddenly started to get so hungry.

876
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:19,530
Oh, my god.

877
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:20,930
I should have eaten before stream.

878
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:21,990
It's my fault.

879
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,630
I'm an idiot.

880
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,990
I'm a dummy dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb stupid head.

881
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,110
I'm really sorry.

882
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:34,510
I should have... I should have eaten before... before... before stream.

883
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,890
I'm so sorry.

884
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,100
Okay, BRB!

885
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,220
BRB!

886
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,460
I quickly grabbed a pizza slash.

887
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,990
Mmm, yum yum.

888
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:57,230
Pizza!

889
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,280
Pineapple and green pepper?

890
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,380
Yeah.

891
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,960
Pizza.

892
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,280
Pizza.

893
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,340
Oh my.

894
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,200
There's something on that I don't like.

895
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm almost done.

896
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,520
It's a small slice because I got a smaller size.

897
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,120
Could use some candy corn?

898
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,190
Huh?

899
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,700
You're judging me for...

900
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,960
You're judging me for putting...

901
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,120
Pineapple?

902
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,060
For putting pineapple and green pepper on mine?

903
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,640
But you're gonna say, oh...

904
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,360
Could use some...

905
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,800
You know...

906
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,920
Could use some candy corn on my pizza.

907
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,200
Ha ha ha.

908
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,000
Ignore the fact that, you know, I totally judge you for...

909
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,560
for...

910
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:30,700
for...

911
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,740
having a...

912
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,400
green...

913
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,140
green pepper and a pineapple.

914
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,080
That's so crazy.

915
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,640
This is Captain K.

916
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,740
Come in, Minto.

917
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,700
Be careful.

918
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,100
There's a dangerous foe on the enemy team.

919
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,300
Codename Robin.

920
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,320
They say he's able to manipulate physics itself...

921
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,760
into baseballs for powerful and deadly throws.

922
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,800
Mmm.

923
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,720
Thank you, Captain.

924
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,020
Pineapple and cucumber pizza?

925
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,780
Not gonna lie?

926
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,660
Would.

927
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,120
Green pepper is great.

928
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:35,840
As is pineapple.

929
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:36,720
I know.

930
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,920
And together, they're awesome.

931
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:39,780
Ha ha.

932
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,160
Keep up the great work.

933
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:46,740
Thank you.

934
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,220
Cheers.

935
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:54,400
Hey, I'm no cheap.

936
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,700
This is a cheat engine.

937
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,380
I'm no cheater.

938
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,800
I'm no cheater?

939
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,930
Why does Owl look like that?

940
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,090
Why does he look like...

941
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,350
He's so...

942
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:17,870
I dunno.

943
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,050
Jalapeno and pineapple?

944
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,270
I can't have spicy, though.

945
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,950
He's sophisticated?

946
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:42,870
I'll give you a piece.

947
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,450
He looks really disappointed.

948
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,210
He looks so disappointed.

949
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:49,790
He's just like...

950
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:53,110
Okay.

951
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,460
Let's get back into the game, everybody.

952
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,580
Did you miss this song?

953
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,320
Also, Verlin, before I...

954
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,300
Because I'm not going to hear your donal.

955
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,620
But welcome back from your trip!

956
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,000
Knock it out of the park.

957
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,480
Thank you!

958
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,940
Thanks for the very spooky donal, too.

959
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,200
Okay.

960
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,240
Here we go.

961
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,330
Cool.

962
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,030
Where's Tigger?

963
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:31,910
I'm not there yet.

964
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:36,930
Two!

965
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,740
Guys, I know your games.

966
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,220
Owl, I know your games.

967
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,820
I know your games.

968
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,260
I know your games.

969
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,520
Oh!

970
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,760
People said that the Japanese one was harder.

971
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,460
Which is if you're curious why I'm playing it in Japanese.

972
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,220
They said it was harder than the English one.

973
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,460
Got 93% on my final.

974
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,940
Let's go!

975
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,980
Hold on.

976
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,040
This next one's for you!

977
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,600
No, run!

978
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,200
Oh.

979
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,000
Hey, hey, wait, wait!

980
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,980
Don't distract me!

981
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,960
That one's for you!

982
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,080
There is an English version.

983
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,720
It's on some Disney site.

984
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,420
This one I got from the Internet Archive.

985
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,460
Oh God.

986
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:52,360
Uh-oh.

987
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,580
Uh-oh.

988
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,380
Oh!

989
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,480
Please... Please!

990
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:11,830
No!

991
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:12,970
What's wrong with me?

992
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,830
What's wrong with me?

993
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:15,650
No!

994
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,610
What's wrong with me?

995
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,150
Nice!

996
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,320
Oh my god!

997
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,620
That one was a pure skill issue.

998
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,360
Ten more!

999
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,060
But we only have room for an error for two.

1000
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,660
So... I mean for one.

1001
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,970
Why is

1002
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,900
it so close to me?

1003
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,380
You're trying to kill me!

1004
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,280
That was a foul pitch!

1005
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,720
That was a foul pitch!

1006
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,830
I spat all over my monitor again.

1007
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:23,970
This never happens.

1008
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,670
I'm getting really into it.

1009
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,490
Thanks for the hot dog, weenie.

1010
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,690
You're a little weenie.

1011
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,550
You're a little weenie.

1012
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,370
That was an owl pitch.

1013
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,770
Now I'm hitting them.

1014
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,030
This is messed up.

1015
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,950
This is so messed up.

1016
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,330
I can't even win!

1017
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,170
Okay.

1018
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,230
I can't even win!

1019
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:50,590
Foul.

1020
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:50,810
Owl.

1021
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,630
So after owl is...

1022
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:08,070
Shoot.

1023
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,890
Is a... Tigger?

1024
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,650
Oh no, no, no, no.

1025
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:16,890
Come on!

1026
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:18,470
Okay.

1027
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,320
I'm gonna hear this in my dreams.

1028
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,340
Why are they calling me weenie?

1029
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,080
Weenie's losing.

1030
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,250
Oh, shoot.

1031
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,310
Oh, that was so close.

1032
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,230
Why did they call him weenie?

1033
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:49,670
Weenie's losing.

1034
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,810
It's so...

1035
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:55,990
Oh, shoot.

1036
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,070
I was too slow.

1037
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,770
Come on!

1038
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,030
This is not looking good for us, you guys.

1039
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,550
Oozzy the Pooh.

1040
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,180
Can I restart the level?

1041
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Can I restart the level already?

1042
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,100
I'm not gonna make it.

1043
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,100
I'm not gonna make it.

1044
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,480
Oh, bother.

1045
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,620
We need to make it to Robin.

1046
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,120
Oh, we'll make it to Robin.

1047
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,020
A hundred percent.

1048
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,520
Hasn't even been an hour.

1049
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:47,660
Four.

1050
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,600
We're gonna make it to Robin.

1051
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,020
Come on!

1052
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,580
Oh, li-li-li-li-li-li-li.

1053
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,870
Oh, come on.

1054
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,320
No.

1055
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,080
Oh!

1056
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,860
I think that's it, right?

1057
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,860
Yeah.

1058
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,420
I can't make it.

1059
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,240
I can't make it.

1060
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,480
I can't make it.

1061
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,260
Oh, my God.

1062
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:42,580
Gopher.

1063
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,640
Why does he glide like this?

1064
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,860
I can't with him.

1065
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,220
Oh, that was a good one.

1066
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,520
I have a system.

1067
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,420
The system.

1068
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:14,720
Wow.

1069
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,840
That wouldn't have even...

1070
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,300
That was...

1071
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,040
That was...

1072
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,700
That baited me.

1073
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,800
I thought it was a home run.

1074
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,360
For real.

1075
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,060
It's cruel that it lets you keep playing even after you can't win.

1076
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:32,420
Right.

1077
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,960
But I guess if you wanna, like, just practice, you know.

1078
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,300
Who play-tested this game and thought the difficulty level was acceptable for children.

1079
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,880
They were like...

1080
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,480
It's just a dumb owl.

1081
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,800
They were like...

1082
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,460
Oh, come on.

1083
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,520
Something to keep the kids busy.

1084
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,420
You know?

1085
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,400
It was a parent that played this and was just like, my kid will be playing it for hours.

1086
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:06,740
My...

1087
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,540
My kid will never get off the computer.

1088
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,380
They'll leave me alone.

1089
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,510
That's what they thought.

1090
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,950
Believe in us that believes in you.

1091
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:18,610
Yeah.

1092
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:21,710
Yeah.

1093
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,410
That was so close.

1094
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,430
Oh, dang it.

1095
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,860
Fard.

1096
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,540
Fard.

1097
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,140
Hito.

1098
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,280
Just like a Minto.

1099
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,260
Minto.

1100
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,040
Thanks you guys for... I actually... I think it's so funny that people started calling me Minto.

1101
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,400
Even though my name is just Mint.

1102
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,720
But people started saying Minto.

1103
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,680
I think that's kind of fun.

1104
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,180
Stop!

1105
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:00,960
Please!

1106
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,320
Please!

1107
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,290
Thanks for indulging me in my stupidness.

1108
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,410
That's not a foul.

1109
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:47,390
Nice.

1110
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,020
Our nickname for our maid.

1111
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,230
It's always these ones.

1112
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,650
That are too slow.

1113
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,070
I can't make it anyway.

1114
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,010
I can't make it anyway.

1115
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:25,390
Owl.

1116
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,770
What the hell?

1117
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,150
Did I just out of whim?

1118
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,050
Maybe this is the stream.

1119
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:41,350
Strat.

1120
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:41,670
What?

1121
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:42,790
What?

1122
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:44,570
Maybe this is the Strat.

1123
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,930
Min in Swedish means...

1124
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,350
Mine.

1125
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,290
So it's Mito.

1126
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:58,930
Mito.

1127
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,830
What is toe in Swedish?

1128
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,290
Oh.

1129
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,970
Dang.

1130
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,030
Mito.

1131
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,630
Mito.

1132
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:13,170
Mito.

1133
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:13,590
Mito.

1134
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:18,530
Is this the furthest we've gotten, you guys?

1135
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:18,930
12?

1136
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,790
19 is rough.

1137
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,790
19 is really rough.

1138
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,350
Johnny Bravo!

1139
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,100
You know, maid mama.

1140
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,300
They sometimes serve baseball peppermint at these games.

1141
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,640
But the mint I prefer is the pretty one on my screen right now.

1142
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:50,460
Johnny!

1143
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,040
Oh...

1144
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,260
Whoa...

1145
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:57,760
EVIL...

1146
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,500
Did they really serve mint at baseball games?

1147
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,040
Did I escape?

1148
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:05,960
Oh my god.

1149
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,300
I can't leave this screen you guys.

1150
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,280
I'm stuck here.

1151
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,800
You can't leave the game once you're in the game.

1152
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,400
You can't I'm going to leave the game.

1153
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,180
Whoa, mama.

1154
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,990
This is what I'm going to do to your head, owl.

1155
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,700
Winners don't hit restart.

1156
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,000
I hit.

1157
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,620
I could technically still make it, which is insane.

1158
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:43,840
Oh, never mind.

1159
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:45,760
So

1160
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,340
close.

1161
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,160
Okay, never mind.

1162
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:57,860
Now we're...

1163
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,540
I have to be a god gamer.

1164
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,160
Why was it so far away from me?

1165
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,700
Okay, this is it.

1166
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Just can't miss.

1167
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,640
Why you guys got to jinx me like that, huh?

1168
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,060
Why you guys got to jinx me like that, huh?

1169
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,900
It's your fault.

1170
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,640
It's your fault.

1171
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:33,930
How far can he get?

1172
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,630
I'm trying to see how far forward he can get.

1173
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,630
I guess this is the furthest he can get.

1174
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,910
It's not my fault.

1175
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,970
It's not your fault.

1176
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,450
Everybody, it's owl's fault.

1177
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:57,770
It's owl's fault.

1178
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:02,490
Please, let me out of here.

1179
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,350
Please, let me out of here.

1180
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,090
If you get all the way to the owl, you can knock him off the mount.

1181
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,130
Actually, he's on a tree stump.

1182
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:16,790
How is that a hit?

1183
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:17,590
Or a home run?

1184
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:18,850
How the heck?

1185
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,130
Also, statistically, Pooh Bear is insane.

1186
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,830
He's getting all these home runs.

1187
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,190
Pooh Bear is kind of insane.

1188
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,950
Which version of Little Busters is this?

1189
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:38,930
Yeah, Pooh is kind of cracked.

1190
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,390
It's all that honey.

1191
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:45,350
Oh god.

1192
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,370
Starting strong.

1193
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,510
Starting strong.

1194
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,310
Starting strong.

1195
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,470
Starting strong.

1196
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:59,750
Starting strong.

1197
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,110
It's the lack of pants.

1198
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,830
Do I need to take off my pants?

1199
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:05,910
Oops.

1200
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,600
It's so easy to underestimate...

1201
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,840
Or to misinterpret the speed of this thing.

1202
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:16,860
Like here.

1203
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:22,240
I'm already...

1204
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,740
You guys, I'm already having bad feelings.

1205
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,870
Just like Strike Witches.

1206
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:40,420
What?

1207
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,820
That was...

1208
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:43,160
That baited me so bad.

1209
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,240
I thought that was it.

1210
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:44,820
I thought...

1211
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,020
I thought that was a home run.

1212
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,940
Are you kidding me?

1213
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,840
It was just a hit.

1214
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,600
Oh my god.

1215
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,540
That one was speedy.

1216
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,040
I'm regressing.

1217
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,520
I'm regressing.

1218
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,540
Lock in my child.

1219
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:03,820
Okay.

1220
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,720
And...

1221
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,680
We're basically done.

1222
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,730
Let me court things with a gift.

1223
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:07,390
Dude.

1224
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:11,370
You are trash.

1225
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,710
Get ready.

1226
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,150
Poobear is coming.

1227
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:15,030
Pool bears not even wearing shoes.

1228
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,170
He has no proper hitting shoes.

1229
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,230
Let me court things with the five-grifter.

1230
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,380
I will need to be tested.

1231
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,960
If we're doing a home run derby, this needs to be a fair, clean game.

1232
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:00,420
Let me court things.

1233
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,740
This needs to be a fair, clean game!

1234
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:23,050
Speaking of poor stats, who's going to run sabermetrics on the entire 100 acre wood?

1235
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,460
Alright guys, alright.

1236
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,620
Locking in, locking in.

1237
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,500
Take our energy, Minto.

1238
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:05,370
Oh!

1239
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:06,350
Three!

1240
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:16,010
That one was more than just a hit.

1241
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:19,950
Come on!

1242
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,150
Come on!

1243
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,970
Thank you, Shallows.

1244
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,530
I'll read it once I'm done.

1245
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:44,690
Please!

1246
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:46,830
No!

1247
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:47,110
No!

1248
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,170
Oh my god!

1249
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:26,870
Just

1250
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,810
barely!

1251
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:34,410
Just barely!

1252
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,910
Just barely!

1253
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,570
Eight.

1254
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:43,930
Eight.

1255
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:51,980
Oh, we're halfway there!

1256
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,120
No!

1257
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,240
That one!

1258
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,200
We're halfway there!

1259
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,360
Now we're halfway there.

1260
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:04,920
Oh god.

1261
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,680
Wait.

1262
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,240
I can't miss one.

1263
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,600
Wait, I just missed one.

1264
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,700
Oh... I just...

1265
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,340
Uh...

1266
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,440
Oh wait.

1267
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,460
It's 19!

1268
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,760
It's not 18!

1269
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,940
Oh, never mind.

1270
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,600
It's not even... Oh gosh, I even got the number wrong.

1271
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,020
Oh, finally it's over.

1272
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,400
Shurya!

1273
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:04,920
Birds.

1274
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,240
Birds.

1275
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:07,880
Okay.

1276
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,400
Owl.

1277
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,220
More like.

1278
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:28,280
We haven't even made it to Tegu yet.

1279
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,220
Do we need to call an exorcist?

1280
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,360
No!

1281
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,440
No!

1282
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:40,760
No!

1283
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,110
I think fowls should count.

1284
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,170
I'm still technically getting it really far.

1285
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,090
Just backwards.

1286
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,700
Yeah, maybe call an exorcist for the ball, honestly.

1287
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,110
Call an exorcist.

1288
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,430
But not for me.

1289
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,070
Oh, is this supposed to be fun?

1290
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,390
I think challenging things are pretty fun.

1291
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,450
Oh, whoops.

1292
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,710
My bad.

1293
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:23,210
That was my bad.

1294
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:25,330
Even though I go a little cuckoo crazy.

1295
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:26,850
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

1296
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,470
While it's happening, you know?

1297
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:32,590
Oh, come on.

1298
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:33,910
That one was really far away.

1299
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,390
Please not a fowl.

1300
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,570
Okay, now it's Jover for real.

1301
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:52,050
Now it's really over.

1302
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:53,830
Oh my god.

1303
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:56,470
I can't...

1304
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:57,630
I get like...

1305
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,650
What's it called?

1306
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:00,050
Like I'm trying to get the tip, right?

1307
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:01,330
But...

1308
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:03,750
I think I'm miscalculating how...

1309
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,430
Where...

1310
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:05,090
I don't know.

1311
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,150
I'm miscalculating.

1312
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,930
Like see?

1313
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:11,010
I feel like that should have...

1314
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:11,410
I don't know.

1315
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:12,250
I have no idea.

1316
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,070
What's the goal?

1317
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,890
We have to get 19 home runs and we're at 4.

1318
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:22,540
5.

1319
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:24,540
Can't make it though.

1320
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,160
There's only 11 balls left.

1321
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,020
We need a break.

1322
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,520
There's some incredible memes about this game.

1323
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,080
Versus Robin Hood is my favorite.

1324
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,340
Oh, it's Robin Hood.

1325
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,080
Versus Robin Hood.

1326
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,060
Christopher Robin.

1327
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,060
Long time VOD.

1328
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,760
Head poking you for the first time in life.

1329
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,740
Thank you.

1330
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,640
Your MGS catalog is the best when I'm chilling with some games.

1331
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,500
Have fun at the con.

1332
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,540
Thank you so much.

1333
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,900
Christopher Robin Hood.

1334
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:02,580
This guy is stealing from my sanity.

1335
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:08,720
Who invented baseball?

1336
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,440
I hate Americans now.

1337
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:12,900
Who invented...

1338
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,960
John Baseball.

1339
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:14,640
I hate you.

1340
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,980
John Baseball is the worst guy in history.

1341
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,760
I will invent a time machine.

1342
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,360
I will go back in time and I will erase that guy.

1343
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,980
We will never have baseball.

1344
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,120
I will never have baseball.

1345
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,720
I will never

1346
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:36,520
have baseball.

1347
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:36,720
Even I will never have baseball.

1348
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,780
I think 12 was the closest we got in guys.

1349
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,500
But they'll still release this game, you know?

1350
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,780
They'll find a way.

1351
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,420
They'll find a way to still release this game.

1352
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,640
Disney will be like, look.

1353
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,180
Look.

1354
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:02,920
We came up with this ultra innovative, super cool game.

1355
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,180
Same.

1356
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,240
No one's ever heard of it before.

1357
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,260
It drains your sanity.

1358
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,760
If I beat this, I'm gonna eat a whole thing of honey!

1359
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,170
Oh my god.

1360
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,470
All the fowls though.

1361
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,220
Nice!

1362
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,540
Oh, that was like a perfect hit, wasn't it?

1363
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,580
Straight down the middle.

1364
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,900
Alright, alright, alright!

1365
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:48,850
Nooo!

1366
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,730
Not enough.

1367
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:56,790
Okay, okay!

1368
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,150
We're at four!

1369
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,880
We're still at four!

1370
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,140
That was too close to me.

1371
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,860
Literally hit an invisible wall.

1372
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,600
I'm gonna...

1373
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,700
Owl, I'm going bockards.

1374
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,560
Owl, it hit an invisible wall.

1375
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,740
They were cheating!

1376
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,760
The Hundred Acre Boys is against me!

1377
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:26,470
OOOH!

1378
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,890
Oops, that was me.

1379
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:35,270
NO!

1380
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:49,620
Seven.

1381
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,760
It's the hits.

1382
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,020
It's the hits.

1383
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,140
It's the hits.

1384
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:16,660
Eyy!

1385
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,340
Please not be a fat...

1386
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,880
Mr.

1387
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:54,900
Owl, how many times does it take to beat your level in winning the Pooh's Home Run Derby?

1388
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,600
Let's see...

1389
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,700
One...

1390
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,760
Two...

1391
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,940
Three...

1392
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,560
Four...

1393
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,880
Five...

1394
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,580
Six...

1395
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:03,940
Seven...

1396
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:04,960
Eight...

1397
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:05,880
Nine...

1398
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,040
Ten...

1399
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:07,920
Eleven...

1400
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,100
Twelve...

1401
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,100
Thirteen...

1402
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,640
Fourteen...

1403
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,760
Fifteen...

1404
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,980
Sixteen...

1405
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,320
Seventeen...

1406
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,300
Eighteen...

1407
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,580
Nineteen...

1408
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,600
Twenty...

1409
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,480
Twenty-one...

1410
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,680
Twenty-two...

1411
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,840
Twenty-three...

1412
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,980
Twenty-four...

1413
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,100
Twenty-five...

1414
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,240
Twenty-six...

1415
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,260
Twenty-seven...

1416
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:27,600
Twenty-eight...

1417
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,900
Twenty-nine...

1418
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:29,460
Twenty...

1419
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,540
Twenty-one...

1420
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:51,520
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50!

1421
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:59,190
I beat my old... No, I didn't beat... I reached my old record!

1422
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,070
I reached my old record.

1423
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,830
12!

1424
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,060
You wanna do upgrades now?

1425
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:09,680
Nope.

1426
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,280
Nope.

1427
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:18,100
My record is not beat.

1428
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,980
You doing okay there, Minto?

1429
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:21,780
Yeah.

1430
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,620
I'm dandy-grandy.

1431
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:32,080
Take me out to the ball game.

1432
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,140
Take me out to the crowd.

1433
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:40,340
Buy me some pizza and cracker jacks.

1434
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:43,540
I don't care if I ever come back.

1435
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,020
So we root, root, root for the home team.

1436
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,360
If they don't win, it's a shame.

1437
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,040
Cause it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

1438
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:01,140
Six strikes, you're out at the old ball game.

1439
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,720
What did they say?

1440
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:08,120
Pizza?

1441
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,060
Wait, what is it?

1442
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,200
How many?

1443
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,040
What did they buy?

1444
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,780
Something and cracker jacks, right?

1445
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,800
Hot dog?

1446
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:19,500
Peanuts!

1447
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,920
I thought it was a pizza.

1448
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,620
Pizza still works.

1449
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,340
It does, right?

1450
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,000
Oh shoot, dog.

1451
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,720
Peanuts and cracker jacks.

1452
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:46,920
Ow!

1453
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,180
I don't care if I ever come back.

1454
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,600
Oh shoot, come on, I'm throwing now.

1455
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,660
I was doing so well.

1456
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,560
There we go.

1457
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,060
Okay, nine left.

1458
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,080
Nine left,

1459
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,470
come on!

1460
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:20,530
I hope one hits Owl in the face.

1461
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,250
Oh yeah, we were pretty robbed for that one.

1462
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,430
We were robbed, we were robbed.

1463
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:31,930
Oh come on, please, please, please.

1464
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:45,380
I thought it would not be a foul.

1465
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:48,640
That one was really far to the right.

1466
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,260
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

1467
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:05,600
We beat my record!

1468
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,120
Uh oh.

1469
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,520
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1470
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,410
I

1471
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,430
was doing so well.

1472
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:51,770
Oh god.

1473
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,690
I was doing so well.

1474
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,650
Real, real, real.

1475
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:03,410
I like, in the beginning, I had like six in a row or something crazy.

1476
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,990
I just didn't want to say anything because...

1477
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:08,130
Oh my god, I can still swing even from back here.

1478
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,610
Money to restore sanity.

1479
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,330
Hey!

1480
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:17,210
Ah!

1481
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:24,750
No!

1482
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:30,820
No!

1483
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,060
No!

1484
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,720
Go back to singing?

1485
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,520
What should I sing?

1486
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,520
Stop throwing and swing?

1487
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:50,220
No, I'm putting you in time out because I'm letting it restart.

1488
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:51,600
Stupid!

1489
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,760
I'm not throwing, I'm letting it restart!

1490
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:55,760
Dummy!

1491
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,020
Can't you tell?

1492
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,580
I had too many mess ups in the beginning!

1493
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:01,940
God!

1494
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,460
I wish though...

1495
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,180
Oh my gosh, I still have 17 left though.

1496
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,000
I wish that I could get through it.

1497
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,520
Throwing the game, stop lying.

1498
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,200
You just want to be put in time out.

1499
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,280
You just want to be put in time out, stupid.

1500
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,260
Put that man out of the park.

1501
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,540
Yeah, it's called strategy chat.

1502
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:39,580
If I mess up in the first five turns, I...

1503
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,540
Just don't even... I just give up.

1504
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,000
Swinging the bat at the owl.

1505
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,320
What if I like...

1506
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,900
Yeah, what if I like throw my bat at the owl?

1507
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,160
And then he dies.

1508
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:03,800
The world will cheer.

1509
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:06,480
Death to you, owl.

1510
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:07,500
Owl.

1511
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,600
Owl, I hope the next worm you eat is your last.

1512
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:13,540
And I hope it's a disgusting rotten worm.

1513
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,360
I hope...

1514
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,620
I hope...

1515
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:27,160
I hope when you're old and your little baby owls are having to take care of you, they throw up in your mouth to feed you because you can't feed yourself anymore because you're just so old.

1516
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,100
And you know what?

1517
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:28,840
You hate it.

1518
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,580
You're just like, this is such an embarrassing life for me now.

1519
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,120
I have to have...

1520
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,340
I'm just like a baby.

1521
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,140
I'm getting thrown up in my mouth.

1522
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,520
I hope so.

1523
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,260
What?

1524
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,320
That's how birds eat.

1525
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,600
Little baby birds get thrown up in their mouth.

1526
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,820
Just like me right now.

1527
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,580
I have to open my mouth.

1528
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,520
Too far, streamer.

1529
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:04,660
Okay.

1530
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,930
Take me out to the ball game.

1531
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:18,570
Take me out to the crowds.

1532
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:22,950
Buy me some pizza and cracker jacks.

1533
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:26,910
I don't care if I ever come back.

1534
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:29,730
So let's root, root, root for the...

1535
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,150
Worm team.

1536
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:36,910
If they don't win, it's a shame.

1537
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:46,350
For it's one, two or three strikes, you're out at the old ball game.

1538
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:56,640
Oh, say can you see?

1539
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:03,240
By the dawn's early light.

1540
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:16,860
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

1541
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:28,780
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight.

1542
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,220
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

1543
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,320
And the rocket's red glare.

1544
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,320
Okay, Americans, calm down.

1545
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,820
This is an American game.

1546
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,980
Were so gallantly...

1547
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,280
Gleaming?

1548
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,340
I don't remember the words.

1549
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:55,960
How the rocket's rainbow bombs bursting in air.

1550
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,260
Gave proof through the

1551
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,000
leg.

1552
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,070
Was still there.

1553
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,560
Okay, not that ball, but you know.

1554
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,440
Yo, please.

1555
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,680
All I'm getting are fouls and hits!

1556
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,680
This is so unfair!

1557
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,730
That was so a home run!

1558
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,510
That was not just a hint!

1559
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:13,710
I mean a hit!

1560
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:14,690
Please!

1561
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:24,390
Oh say, can you see?

1562
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:26,970
Yeah, it's not possible, no.

1563
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:00,390
Just four?

1564
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:13,090
What's another song I can sing?

1565
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:17,610
We gotta be really patriotic, apparently.

1566
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,590
It works.

1567
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:20,810
This land is your land!

1568
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:21,990
Okay, never mind.

1569
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:22,470
Wrong song.

1570
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,690
They don't want to hear that one anymore.

1571
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:27,630
Oh, Canada!

1572
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:37,010
Country roads?

1573
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,230
Almost heaven.

1574
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:41,570
West Virginia.

1575
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:45,470
Blue Ridge Mountains.

1576
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:47,530
Shenandoah River.

1577
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:50,730
Shit.

1578
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:53,570
Life is old here.

1579
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:55,300
Older than owls.

1580
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:57,710
Owl, your days are numbered.

1581
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:59,510
Owl, your days are numbered.

1582
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:01,410
Owl, your days are numbered.

1583
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:05,210
Owl, your days are numbered.

1584
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,410
Owl, your days are numbered.

1585
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:08,690
Owl, your days are numbered.

1586
01:31:08,690 --> 01:31:10,870
Owl, your days are numbered.

1587
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:12,090
Owl, your days are numbered.

1588
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:12,350
Owl, your days are numbered.

1589
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:13,490
Just like this match.

1590
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,100
Oh, never mind.

1591
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:23,140
That's fine.

1592
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,920
Okay, four.

1593
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:34,020
Clip that and send it to Owl.

1594
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:36,240
Oh, he knows.

1595
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,340
He knows.

1596
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,520
Owl City Fireflies.

1597
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,500
You would not believe your eyes.

1598
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,420
You would not believe your eyes.

1599
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,540
Oh, shit.

1600
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,060
That was mean.

1601
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:54,640
No!

1602
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,570
Guys, I don't think this is the one either, though.

1603
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:20,450
Why so many Fowls?

1604
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,510
Why so many Fowls?

1605
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:38,680
Because he's a Fowl.

1606
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:40,900
Fowl City.

1607
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,480
That's just New York.

1608
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,150
Oh, come on.

1609
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:05,690
That one was so fast and so close to my face.

1610
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:12,650
Guys, it's not possible.

1611
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:16,150
It's not possible.

1612
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,030
It's not possible.

1613
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,210
It's not possible.

1614
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:23,530
It's not possible.

1615
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,160
You guys, be honest with me.

1616
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,700
Do a lot of people struggle on Owl?

1617
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,540
Is it just me?

1618
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,100
Is it just me?

1619
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,580
Am I...

1620
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:50,520
Is it just me?

1621
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,360
Yeah?

1622
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,120
Okay.

1623
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:58,860
It's just you.

1624
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:00,800
Oh!

1625
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:01,600
Oh my god.

1626
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:03,960
Sorry, I accidentally clicked the status link.

1627
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,800
Owl's the gatekeeper?

1628
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:08,280
Okay.

1629
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:13,690
I was...

1630
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,030
That went in between the fence?

1631
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:17,670
I'm sorry.

1632
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:18,510
How was that a hint?

1633
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:19,930
Who was going to go pick that up?

1634
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,130
That one was far.

1635
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,510
And I couldn't gauge it.

1636
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:35,450
You guys, it might be time for...

1637
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:36,170
Okay, you know what?

1638
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:39,230
After this one, I'm doing a upgrade.

1639
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,510
I'm going to do upgrades after this.

1640
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:46,750
I'm going to do upgrades after this.

1641
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,990
Acceptable to quit after Owl and be a...

1642
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,150
No!

1643
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:55,310
Why would I quit after Owl and still be a...

1644
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:55,610
What?

1645
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:56,990
Hell no.

1646
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,780
If other VTubers also do...

1647
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:11,180
If other people do upgrades too...

1648
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,160
I can do upgrades.

1649
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:42,130
Keep starting up.

1650
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:46,710
And of course I will...

1651
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,010
While you...

1652
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:48,110
Oh my god.

1653
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,630
Our map is...

1654
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:49,950
It's like...

1655
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,450
Oh...

1656
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,340
What is this?

1657
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,410
For my 3.8?

1658
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:03,850
I'm like 0.9.

1659
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:06,810
As the leagueing, Game run.

1660
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:08,750
Oh, strike.

1661
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:10,850
Striker!

1662
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:16,030
Him or the hero used upgrades.

1663
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:20,010
Not a foul.

1664
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:20,970
It is a foul!

1665
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:25,700
Foul.

1666
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,420
Foul.

1667
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:31,640
Foul.

1668
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,380
It's just one foul after this.

1669
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:40,450
Oh, it's not even possible for me to beat this.

1670
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:41,290
I just realized.

1671
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:44,930
It's not even possible for me to beat this level anymore!

1672
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:09,160
Not with that attitude.

1673
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:16,440
Yeah, let me just hack the game and insert more balls.

1674
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,200
Everybody gets more balls.

1675
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:31,870
Oh, that was actually not bad for just a random one.

1676
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:35,890
Computer.

1677
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:40,350
Increase balls and ball size.

1678
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:43,530
Increase ball, ball size.

1679
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:46,470
Ten is not bad, I guess.

1680
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:48,630
It's over halfway there.

1681
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:50,130
Alright.

1682
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:53,430
How many points do I have?

1683
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:01,070
So probably speed...

1684
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:05,210
and meat.

1685
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:07,990
Wow, power is 500 points.

1686
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,630
Okay.

1687
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:11,930
Like

1688
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:16,820
that?

1689
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:17,580
Level 3?

1690
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,880
It's not meat, that's honey.

1691
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:32,060
Max?

1692
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:32,640
No.

1693
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,240
Let's see how this... if this changes anything.

1694
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:39,960
Let's see if this changes anything.

1695
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:40,240
Oh!

1696
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:43,940
Well,

1697
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:51,500
you know.

1698
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:58,380
It feels so much smoother moving Poobye right now.

1699
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:01,620
Am I longest?

1700
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:01,960
Really?

1701
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:03,420
Oh god.

1702
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,700
Where's the power?

1703
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,420
Where's the power now?

1704
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,240
Oops.

1705
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:33,030
Where's the power?

1706
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:39,250
Is it just a placebo?

1707
01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:41,110
Uh-oh.

1708
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:42,870
Is it just a placebo?

1709
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:46,190
Uh-oh.

1710
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:46,530
Wait.

1711
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:48,350
It's not the swing that's faster, right?

1712
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:51,430
It's me that's faster.

1713
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:53,930
Right?

1714
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:57,350
Oops.

1715
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:03,430
Yeah, Pooh's movement.

1716
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1717
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:05,530
141.7!

1718
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:12,870
Okay.

1719
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:17,280
Oh, come on.

1720
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:18,520
Okay.

1721
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:26,850
Yeah, Pooh is lagging behind your mouse.

1722
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,510
Yeah, right?

1723
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:29,110
He was lagging so much before.

1724
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:33,150
Seven.

1725
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:36,800
Oh!

1726
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,700
I think I made it.

1727
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:39,000
Yes!

1728
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:39,700
Yes!

1729
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:40,260
Yes!

1730
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:44,900
Foul!

1731
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,800
That should have not been a foul.

1732
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,100
Foul ball.

1733
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:53,300
Hit.

1734
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:54,900
Oh, no.

1735
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:55,360
Oh, no.

1736
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:01,760
Oh, gosh.

1737
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,380
I only have...

1738
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,160
I don't have a lot of room for error, you guys.

1739
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,840
I don't have a lot of room for error.

1740
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:09,220
144!

1741
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,260
11.

1742
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,610
Oh, shoot.

1743
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:29,330
That was me.

1744
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:32,590
What the...

1745
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:33,190
Uh-oh.

1746
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:33,990
No, no, no.

1747
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:34,770
Please, please, please, God.

1748
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:37,730
That one was funky.

1749
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:44,230
I don't think I can win anymore, can I?

1750
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:44,250
Can I?

1751
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:58,620
It's fine.

1752
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:58,760
It's fine.

1753
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,580
I was getting used to the new speed and stuff.

1754
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,220
I was getting used to it.

1755
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,940
I was getting used to it, you guys.

1756
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,880
Can I beat my record?

1757
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,340
Nope.

1758
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:41,710
Okay.

1759
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:43,810
Whoa, he's so fast now.

1760
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:46,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1761
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:48,330
Pooh bear, Pooh bear.

1762
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:49,490
Pooh bear, calm down.

1763
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:51,710
Pooh bear, calm down.

1764
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,680
Not even increasing my meat could make me...

1765
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:18,630
Damn.

1766
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:21,230
What's in that honey?

1767
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:22,910
Poo says.

1768
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:27,150
Give me more honey, Christopher Robin.

1769
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:31,830
That's not a foul.

1770
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:34,630
143.

1771
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:45,330
Give me more power, Christopher Robin.

1772
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:47,690
Performance enhancing on you.

1773
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:51,250
Nothing will...

1774
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:53,970
Stop!

1775
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:00,030
Oh come on.

1776
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:08,490
Nothing will improve my timing though.

1777
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,830
Nothing can improve my timing I guess.

1778
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:33,210
I missed baseball back before the poos were juicing.

1779
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:38,050
No, I'm not gonna do any more upgrades than what I did.

1780
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,530
Oh gosh.

1781
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:43,110
Well, maybe I need to though.

1782
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:47,030
I need more meat!

1783
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:57,570
I think that should have hit but...

1784
01:44:57,570 --> 01:44:58,330
Um...

1785
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:00,870
You're the oomph.

1786
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:02,290
You're the oomph.

1787
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:09,480
160.

1788
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:11,660
Oh.

1789
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:14,780
Oh.

1790
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:15,660
Oh my god.

1791
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:15,840
Wait.

1792
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:16,280
Okay.

1793
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,780
You guys, I just can't miss.

1794
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,020
I just can't miss and I'll make it.

1795
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:25,530
Okay.

1796
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,700
Oh, this one.

1797
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,520
This hit would have...

1798
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,000
Would have killed me anyway too.

1799
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:45,080
That hit would have killed me anyway too.

1800
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,920
Misses immediately.

1801
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,300
It's like art.

1802
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:56,740
It's like an art being this comedic timing, huh?

1803
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:09,090
Is a poo an actual kind of bear?

1804
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:11,390
I don't think so.

1805
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:17,340
A poo bear.

1806
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,280
Winnie the poo bear.

1807
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,520
Oh, I almost hit Owl.

1808
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:26,920
I almost hit Owl.

1809
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:28,760
Oh my god.

1810
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:30,920
Poo bear.

1811
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,640
Winnie the poo bear.

1812
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:34,640
Looking for fun.

1813
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,080
Chasing some honeybees.

1814
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,720
Poo bear, I know he's out there.

1815
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:40,500
Oh.

1816
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,440
Rumbly tumbly.

1817
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:48,440
Something in a honey tree.

1818
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:54,180
He's so... wait, I don't remember the words.

1819
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,540
He's so adventurous.

1820
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:01,580
He's sneaking out again.

1821
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:05,520
But when you're alone, there's nobody home.

1822
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:12,020
It's nice to spend time with a bear named Pool Bear.

1823
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,560
Winnie the Poop.

1824
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,780
My longest foul ever.

1825
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:26,380
Plays the... the what theme?

1826
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:38,110
I'm disappointed this wasn't referenced in Kingdom Hearts 3.

1827
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:42,190
Oh my

1828
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:48,220
god!

1829
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,640
What was the point of increasing my power?

1830
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,860
I don't think it really does anything.

1831
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:57,060
Unless you did the home run.

1832
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:58,800
No!

1833
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,460
I knew that it wouldn't be home run!

1834
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,520
I knew it!

1835
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:07,000
I knew it!

1836
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,380
That one was too fast.

1837
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:19,380
I'm gonna have real carpal tunnel after this.

1838
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:20,460
Shit.

1839
01:48:24,450 --> 01:48:25,350
Please, please, please!

1840
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:25,850
Yes!

1841
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:33,990
What if they do a Hololive version?

1842
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:36,350
Please don't give Kay any more ideas.

1843
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:42,250
Kay will do it and I'm terrified of that.

1844
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:43,230
Please don't.

1845
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:43,810
Please.

1846
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:56,940
Okay, I gotta lock in, you guys.

1847
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,220
Okay.

1848
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,340
Lock in.

1849
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:03,460
I'm locking in.

1850
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:06,620
No!

1851
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,640
Uh-oh.

1852
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,140
I don't have very much room for...

1853
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,060
Why are you so good now?

1854
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:22,500
I don't know.

1855
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:37,420
I don't have a new record.

1856
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:38,100
Really?

1857
01:50:43,290 --> 01:50:44,970
Playing this game and streaming hard.

1858
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,440
Come on!

1859
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,960
I don't even see...

1860
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,820
I don't even see it hit the wall.

1861
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,440
Oh my god.

1862
01:51:07,470 --> 01:51:08,230
Oh my god.

1863
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:09,970
Like, the game actually lagged.

1864
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:14,310
I think it lagged and just believed that it would be a foul.

1865
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:19,680
Oh my god.

1866
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,580
That was me.

1867
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,500
That was me.

1868
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,280
Oh.

1869
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:24,160
That was awesome.

1870
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,460
You guys, I don't know what it is.

1871
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:32,360
I don't know what's... what's wrong with me.

1872
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:35,940
Minto, Minto.

1873
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:36,780
She's our girl.

1874
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:38,780
What the fuck?

1875
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,960
It's the lag.

1876
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:47,600
Totally.

1877
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:49,380
Yeah.

1878
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,220
Everybody say it with me.

1879
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,820
It's the lag!

1880
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:05,670
It's the lag!

1881
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:08,410
It's the lag!

1882
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:08,830
Oh my god.

1883
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:09,370
That was mean.

1884
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:10,150
That was so mean.

1885
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:14,890
It was so slow that I was like...

1886
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:16,130
Just... just... come on!

1887
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:21,210
Pow!

1888
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:31,300
Yeah,

1889
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,320
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1890
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,080
Come on!

1891
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:43,300
Come on!

1892
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,680
It's the hag.

1893
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:55,960
Guys, this is not the run.

1894
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:58,880
This is not the run.

1895
01:52:59,260 --> 01:52:59,860
Oh, yeah.

1896
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,660
I can't even make it.

1897
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,000
Yep.

1898
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:01,340
Okay.

1899
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,500
Oh, man!

1900
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:19,960
Oh.

1901
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:23,900
Three!

1902
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:28,820
Two!

1903
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:48,890
Okay.

1904
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:49,770
Let's go.

1905
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:51,030
Let's go!

1906
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:57,320
The eagle fly higher.

1907
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,060
Above the clouds.

1908
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:14,060
I am God's toughest warrior.

1909
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:27,860
Don't

1910
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:45,480
get the same test paper.

1911
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:56,620
square, square, square.

1912
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:57,720
.

1913
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:39,940
Uh-oh.

1914
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,020
Sorry, Dwayne.

1915
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:41,740
Sorry, Dwayne.

1916
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:51,470
Dang it!

1917
01:55:51,790 --> 01:55:52,870
Are you contagious?

1918
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:00,150
We

1919
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:20,680
hit!

1920
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,500
We hit him!

1921
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:21,860
We hit him!

1922
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,420
We hit the bird!

1923
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:24,420
Yeah!

1924
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:25,840
Blblblblblbl.

1925
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,220
Baller 194 is dead.

1926
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,460
saves It's working.

1927
01:56:55,110 --> 01:56:55,630
Wait.

1928
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,260
Wait, that's a foul, isn't it?

1929
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,040
No!

1930
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:15,480
No!

1931
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:17,160
No!

1932
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,120
Otherwise we would have had it!

1933
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:22,760
Oh

1934
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:47,210
my god!

1935
01:57:47,450 --> 01:57:48,310
Oh my...

1936
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:11,650
Oh man.

1937
01:58:12,710 --> 01:58:14,650
Also, I'm not doing any more upgrades.

1938
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:17,250
I decided that I... I stopped it.

1939
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:18,350
I wanted to stop with the upgrades.

1940
01:58:18,610 --> 01:58:20,670
The number of upgrades that I did, so...

1941
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:22,150
At this point, I don't...

1942
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:25,530
I don't think I need any more.

1943
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:26,670
I think it's just skill, you know?

1944
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:31,090
Yeah, so...

1945
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:32,370
If you...

1946
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:35,370
Please don't spam about upgrades anymore.

1947
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:40,650
And if I do more in the future...

1948
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:43,770
If it really becomes impossible...

1949
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:45,010
You know, whatever, but...

1950
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:47,250
I think we have enough, truly.

1951
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:48,830
But right now, it's just a skill issue.

1952
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:49,910
I think.

1953
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:51,390
I know, actually.

1954
01:58:53,110 --> 01:58:54,330
It's just a skill issue.

1955
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:58,510
Can we ask for downgrades?

1956
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:02,470
You're already a downgrade.

1957
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:06,190
You're my downgrade.

1958
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:08,210
Actually...

1959
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:10,810
No, the downgrade is streaming while playing this game.

1960
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:13,030
So yeah, you guys are my downgrades.

1961
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:20,690
Chat debuff.

1962
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:46,870
Our Rellee's getting And finally something.

1963
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:51,530
I think it's over.

1964
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:52,910
I think the blue dump is over.

1965
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:52,910
It's over.

1966
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:55,390
We need to find a new strat now.

1967
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,690
I think we need to find a new strat.

1968
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,150
Oh shit.

1969
02:00:13,590 --> 02:00:14,190
Did that?

1970
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:15,070
Oh no, that was a foul.

1971
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:23,630
Uh-oh.

1972
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:24,470
Oh no, no, no.

1973
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:28,030
And another foul.

1974
02:00:34,650 --> 02:00:35,630
I can't.

1975
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:39,430
This is not the run either because I can't afford to have any mistakes.

1976
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:42,710
Yep, and there goes the run.

1977
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:10,790
Use the mantra, I am Mint, I will commit, I will have a homerun hit.

1978
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:13,750
I don't know clockwork if I can remember all of that.

1979
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:18,010
I am Mint, I will commit, I will have a homerun hit.

1980
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:21,410
I am Mint, I will commit, I will have a homerun hit.

1981
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:23,210
I like the upgrades.

1982
02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:24,830
You're my best upgrade.

1983
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:31,250
Are you winning, Mint?

1984
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:33,950
Gosh, the first couple of levels were so easy.

1985
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:35,890
And then Owl came.

1986
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:40,890
And then Owl came.

1987
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:44,770
Oh my gosh.

1988
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:48,850
He's worthy of stage 6.

1989
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:52,130
That's how they get you.

1990
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:56,550
That's how they get you.

1991
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:05,270
Oh, I believe in oneself.

1992
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:06,010
Way too poor.

1993
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:06,630
That cow.

1994
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:07,930
Okay.

1995
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:09,870
No.

1996
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:12,530
I gotta lock in, I gotta lock in.

1997
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:22,450
Screen person.

1998
02:02:22,990 --> 02:02:23,550
No.

1999
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:25,310
Okay, stop reading chat.

2000
02:02:27,950 --> 02:02:29,870
I really need to stop reading chat.

2001
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:33,430
Okay, okay.

2002
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:41,540
My eyes are wide.

2003
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:44,020
And ready to receive.

2004
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:45,440
Ball.

2005
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:01,730
Yeah!

2006
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:16,790
How does it count as a foul though?

2007
02:03:17,070 --> 02:03:17,850
It's still...

2008
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:19,070
It's still...

2009
02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:22,030
It still went out of...

2010
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:23,250
It's...

2011
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,230
It's still...

2012
02:03:24,910 --> 02:03:26,410
It hit, I think.

2013
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:28,330
It didn't go behind.

2014
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:31,990
It just went a little to the right.

2015
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:33,970
I see your wandering eyes.

2016
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:34,690
Hey, shut up.

2017
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:39,850
Foul!

2018
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,140
Oh, shit.

2019
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:45,540
Okay.

2020
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,560
See, that counts as a foul, I think.

2021
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,020
But, you know.

2022
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:54,680
Oh my god.

2023
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,200
No, no, no.

2024
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:55,440
Please.

2025
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:56,120
Please, please, please.

2026
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,430
No.

2027
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:17,780
Please, please, please.

2028
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:19,580
Oh, it's a foul.

2029
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:21,800
Oh, it's a foul.

2030
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:23,800
Fuck.

2031
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:24,800
Shit.

2032
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,240
Fuck you.

2033
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:26,800
Ow.

2034
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,740
You fuck.

2035
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:28,460
Oh, fucking fuck!

2036
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:54,940
It's just...

2037
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:57,320
It's an owl's world we live in, you guys.

2038
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:00,140
It's an owl's world we live in.

2039
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,700
I can't...

2040
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:04,420
If I make no mistakes...

2041
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:04,680
Oh, wait.

2042
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:05,460
Why did I just say that?

2043
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:07,060
Why did I just say that?

2044
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:08,320
Why did I just say that?

2045
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:09,460
Why did I just say that?

2046
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:13,120
Okay.

2047
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:14,980
Oh...

2048
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:30,500
Oh my god.

2049
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:30,800
Oh my god.

2050
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:31,040
Oh my god.

2051
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:31,340
Oh my god.

2052
02:05:31,580 --> 02:05:32,600
How to

2053
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:16,580
acho.

2054
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:19,980
Take me out to the ball game.

2055
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:24,840
Take me out to the crowd.

2056
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:30,160
Buy me some pizza and cracker dice.

2057
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:36,100
I don't care if I never come back.

2058
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:43,560
So let's root, root, root for the home gym.

2059
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:47,920
If they know it, it's a shame.

2060
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:54,560
So which one?

2061
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:55,460
Shit.

2062
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:56,800
Two.

2063
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:59,240
Three strikes here.

2064
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:02,080
At the old...

2065
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:05,940
game.

2066
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:15,440
Owl.

2067
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:16,460
Owl.

2068
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:18,840
How much do I need to bribe you?

2069
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,380
How much do I need to bribe you, owl?

2070
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:24,420
How much do I need to bribe you, owl?

2071
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,380
How much do I need to bribe you, owl?

2072
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:33,000
How much do you want?

2073
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:34,420
Worms?

2074
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:35,120
I got them.

2075
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:41,140
What else do owls eat?

2076
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:42,400
Little mice?

2077
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:45,780
What else do you want?

2078
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:49,960
What else do you want?

2079
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,160
Rats, yeah?

2080
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:54,540
Little mice and...

2081
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:55,960
Rabbit?

2082
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:01,600
I can give them rabbit.

2083
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:04,300
How much you want, owl?

2084
02:08:04,940 --> 02:08:05,940
How much you want?

2085
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,500
How much you want, owl?

2086
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:10,380
How much you want?

2087
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:11,600
I'll give you anything.

2088
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:12,780
Please.

2089
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:16,400
Please.

2090
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:16,620
Please.

2091
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:19,700
I'll give you worm.

2092
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,060
I'll give you mouse.

2093
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:22,860
I'll give you anything.

2094
02:08:23,420 --> 02:08:24,060
I'll give...

2095
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:24,360
Oh shit.

2096
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,060
Come on.

2097
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:27,720
Just count it.

2098
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,980
Whatever you want, it's yours, baby.

2099
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:34,240
Please.

2100
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:36,260
I'll sell my home to you.

2101
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:38,060
No!

2102
02:08:38,060 --> 02:08:38,500
Owl!

2103
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:42,000
I'll sell you whatever you want.

2104
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,580
Whatever you want, owl.

2105
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:45,660
Whatever you want.

2106
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,660
You can have my first newborn.

2107
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:50,760
It'll be really small and easy for you to eat.

2108
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:52,660
I promise you.

2109
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:55,460
Oh god.

2110
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,420
Please.

2111
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,640
You want some worms?

2112
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:00,380
Worms.

2113
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:01,060
Worms.

2114
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:01,400
Worms.

2115
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,080
I got you worms.

2116
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:03,120
Worms.

2117
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:03,860
Worms.

2118
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:05,480
Worms.

2119
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:06,320
You want worms?

2120
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:07,320
I got you worms.

2121
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:08,780
Shit.

2122
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:09,900
You want...

2123
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:11,360
You want some rats?

2124
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:12,100
I got you...

2125
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,520
Shit.

2126
02:09:12,780 --> 02:09:13,880
No, I don't have you shit.

2127
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:15,440
I have you rats and worms.

2128
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,120
Worms!

2129
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:16,720
He wants worms!

2130
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:17,520
He wants worms!

2131
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:18,680
Worms is the word.

2132
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:20,200
Worms is the lucky word.

2133
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:21,280
Worms.

2134
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:21,660
Worms.

2135
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:22,380
He wants the worms.

2136
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:24,440
I got plenty of worms.

2137
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:25,320
They're all in my brain.

2138
02:09:25,380 --> 02:09:28,840
I will crack open my skull right now for you, owl.

2139
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:29,780
I'll crack it open.

2140
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,920
A cold one.

2141
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:31,720
Actually, no.

2142
02:09:31,780 --> 02:09:33,180
My brain is warm and squishy.

2143
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:34,120
And...

2144
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,500
Probably really delicious and easy for you to eat.

2145
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:38,780
Oh god.

2146
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:39,340
Oh god.

2147
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:39,700
Oh god.

2148
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:40,060
Please.

2149
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:40,940
Worms.

2150
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:42,260
Worms.

2151
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:43,320
Worms.

2152
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:43,920
Worms.

2153
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:43,940
Worms.

2154
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:44,300
Worms.

2155
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:48,900
Worms.

2156
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:36,830
Luckily, you can keep your firstborn.

2157
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:37,470
True.

2158
02:10:37,810 --> 02:10:39,050
He didn't want it.

2159
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:41,290
He didn't want my firstborn.

2160
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:42,370
All right.

2161
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:44,290
Hello, darkness.

2162
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:46,030
My old friend.

2163
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:54,690
That's a foul.

2164
02:10:54,910 --> 02:10:55,250
That's a foul.

2165
02:10:56,790 --> 02:11:00,590
I think they need to give us a hundred balls, not just thirty.

2166
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:03,690
He wants your firstborn and your second.

2167
02:11:03,950 --> 02:11:06,750
You can have every single one of my children, owl.

2168
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:08,310
You know what?

2169
02:11:08,410 --> 02:11:08,850
It's fine.

2170
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:13,130
I'll just keep popping out babies and you can eat every single one of them.

2171
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:16,730
A delicious nine-month baked meal.

2172
02:11:17,010 --> 02:11:17,990
Just for you.

2173
02:11:19,870 --> 02:11:21,070
Actually, I'll even...

2174
02:11:21,070 --> 02:11:23,050
I'll just start stealing babies instead.

2175
02:11:23,190 --> 02:11:23,770
You know what?

2176
02:11:23,770 --> 02:11:26,930
You can have the firstborn, the secondborn.

2177
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:29,450
You can have my neighbor's borns.

2178
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:31,710
You can have the bloodborns.

2179
02:11:31,710 --> 02:11:33,830
You can have all the babies.

2180
02:11:33,910 --> 02:11:35,030
Look, he's how happy.

2181
02:11:35,050 --> 02:11:35,930
He says, babies.

2182
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:38,330
Give me more babies.

2183
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:42,030
Give me sweet, tender little infants.

2184
02:11:42,590 --> 02:11:46,450
I like when their brains are soft and their head is mushy.

2185
02:11:46,810 --> 02:11:47,430
Yeah.

2186
02:11:49,470 --> 02:11:53,390
You can have every little baby in the world.

2187
02:11:53,770 --> 02:11:55,050
Mr. Owl.

2188
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:59,950
I will sacrifice all the children for you.

2189
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:05,990
You can have kids.

2190
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:08,130
And then you'll eat them.

2191
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:09,770
Kids for breakfast.

2192
02:12:09,870 --> 02:12:10,810
Kids for lunch.

2193
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:11,650
Kids for dinner.

2194
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:12,510
Kids for brunch.

2195
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:13,470
Kids for dinner.

2196
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:16,950
Literally any afternoon tea and kids.

2197
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:19,050
Please.

2198
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:20,190
Please.

2199
02:12:23,770 --> 02:12:24,190
There we go.

2200
02:12:29,370 --> 02:12:30,270
All right.

2201
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:31,670
Shit.

2202
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:35,410
I got to still talk about the children.

2203
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:36,410
The children.

2204
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:40,090
He says, tell me more about what flavor these kids will be.

2205
02:12:40,370 --> 02:12:44,310
Oh, they'll be every flavor you ever imagine you want them to be.

2206
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:46,370
You want a kid that's salty?

2207
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:47,210
I got you.

2208
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:48,990
Just make them cry a little.

2209
02:12:49,170 --> 02:12:51,790
Oh, their tears just really...

2210
02:12:51,790 --> 02:12:53,910
And I can even butter one up for you.

2211
02:12:54,070 --> 02:12:54,790
Oh, please.

2212
02:12:58,130 --> 02:12:59,730
Put one in some vinegar.

2213
02:13:00,090 --> 02:13:00,930
No, we don't like that.

2214
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:01,430
Okay.

2215
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:01,650
Okay.

2216
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:05,190
You want some...

2217
02:13:05,190 --> 02:13:07,850
What other flavors do you like?

2218
02:13:08,010 --> 02:13:08,770
Spicy kids?

2219
02:13:09,250 --> 02:13:11,290
Ones that throw temper tantrums?

2220
02:13:11,430 --> 02:13:12,190
I don't know.

2221
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:16,370
Every brain is a little bit different for you, Mr. Owl.

2222
02:13:16,990 --> 02:13:17,870
Every brain.

2223
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:19,890
Every brain.

2224
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:21,410
Here's a little child.

2225
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:23,170
Oh, this one?

2226
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:25,510
Okay, Mr. Owl.

2227
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:26,390
I'm going to have to take a kid away.

2228
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:27,190
I'm sorry.

2229
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:27,510
I'm sorry.

2230
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:28,150
Please.

2231
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:31,150
All right.

2232
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:32,150
I'm going to go down.

2233
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:35,070
I'm going to go to the pool and I'm going to go find you a baby now.

2234
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:35,810
All right.

2235
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:36,730
Where am I going to find a baby?

2236
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:38,970
Mr. Owl.

2237
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:39,610
Mr. Owl.

2238
02:13:39,670 --> 02:13:41,030
I'm taking a kid away.

2239
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:42,310
Mr. Owl.

2240
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:44,650
Mr. Owl.

2241
02:13:45,890 --> 02:13:46,530
Mr. Owl.

2242
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:48,470
Mr. Owl.

2243
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:48,490
Mr. Owl.

2244
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:51,170
I'm going to the library and I'm going to go fetch a fresh baby for you.

2245
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:52,010
Okay.

2246
02:13:52,090 --> 02:13:52,830
Mr. Owl.

2247
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:54,510
Now I'm going to go to the park.

2248
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:56,290
The park has plenty of children.

2249
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:57,070
Okay.

2250
02:13:57,070 --> 02:13:57,910
Where am I going next?

2251
02:13:58,770 --> 02:13:59,210
Feast.

2252
02:13:59,450 --> 02:13:59,890
Feast.

2253
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:00,630
Mr. Owl.

2254
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:01,690
Mr. Owl.

2255
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:02,650
It's your buffet.

2256
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:04,530
Mr. Owl.

2257
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:05,730
Mr. Owl.

2258
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:09,670
You will have every child that you can imagine eating.

2259
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:10,610
You.

2260
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:12,290
It will be your buffet.

2261
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:13,410
Mr. Owl.

2262
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:14,130
Mr. Owl.

2263
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:14,390
Please.

2264
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:15,370
Mr. Owl.

2265
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:18,930
I'm not giving you shit.

2266
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:20,870
You stinking son of a bitch.

2267
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:22,210
None of them are for you.

2268
02:14:28,610 --> 02:14:30,510
You're not getting shit from me.

2269
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:31,010
Mr. Owl.

2270
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:44,630
Time for Tigger.

2271
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:48,530
And you know the wonderful thing about Tigger is Tigger is a wonderful thing.

2272
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:51,590
His tops are made of rubber and his bottoms are made of strings.

2273
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:52,250
Springs.

2274
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:53,170
Not strings.

2275
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:56,790
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

2276
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:57,770
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

2277
02:14:58,010 --> 02:15:01,130
The wonderful thing about Tigger is I'm the only one.

2278
02:15:01,150 --> 02:15:01,770
What the?

2279
02:15:02,570 --> 02:15:03,050
One.

2280
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:05,350
One.

2281
02:15:06,350 --> 02:15:07,630
I'm the only one.

2282
02:15:08,990 --> 02:15:09,770
The wonderful thing about Tigger is I'm the only one.

2283
02:15:09,770 --> 02:15:12,170
The wonderful thing about Tigger is Tigger is a wonderful thing.

2284
02:15:28,730 --> 02:15:30,290
How do you do that, Tigger?

2285
02:15:31,670 --> 02:15:32,630
How do you do that?

2286
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:40,680
Advancee who is worthy.

2287
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:42,320
Shit.

2288
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:46,320
And you have to get 28?

2289
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:52,280
You have to get 28?

2290
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,820
Oh my god.

2291
02:16:02,930 --> 02:16:03,710
Oh no.

2292
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:03,950
Oh no.

2293
02:16:17,610 --> 02:16:18,110
Hayai.

2294
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:19,490
Hayai.

2295
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:32,630
He's using Camel.

2296
02:16:33,770 --> 02:16:35,910
He's using stealth Camel.

2297
02:16:38,590 --> 02:16:41,630
It would be great if I could just get not Fowl's though.

2298
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:44,730
Then I could actually beat him.

2299
02:16:44,830 --> 02:16:45,110
Right?

2300
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:47,590
Oh my god.

2301
02:16:47,650 --> 02:16:48,730
That was too fast anyway.

2302
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:51,050
Oh my god.

2303
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:51,730
Oh my god.

2304
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:53,530
We need thermal goggles, real.

2305
02:16:55,470 --> 02:16:57,490
But I keep just getting fouls.

2306
02:16:57,550 --> 02:16:58,950
Keep your eye on the ball.

2307
02:16:59,130 --> 02:17:00,430
The ball in question.

2308
02:17:03,090 --> 02:17:04,090
Hey, but we got five!

2309
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:18,580
Six!

2310
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,920
The wonderful thing about Tigger.

2311
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:22,460
His taper's the wonderful thing.

2312
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:23,800
His top's made of rubber.

2313
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:25,220
His bottom's made of springs.

2314
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:27,020
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

2315
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:27,880
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!

2316
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,420
Oh my god, I don't know why I'm...

2317
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:34,860
Oh god.

2318
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:39,020
I can't get the timing at all.

2319
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:42,200
I can't get the timing at all.

2320
02:17:43,220 --> 02:17:44,700
I can't get the timing at all!

2321
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:48,620
Is he fun?

2322
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:49,360
Are you having fun?

2323
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:52,620
Maybe.

2324
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:57,020
It just goes by really quickly, which is kinda nice.

2325
02:17:58,140 --> 02:18:00,180
Okay, yeah, time to start counting, for real.

2326
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:02,860
And only four?

2327
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:04,160
He only gives you forty?

2328
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:06,400
He only gives you forty!

2329
02:18:07,460 --> 02:18:08,260
Oh my gosh.

2330
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:11,460
Do people, like, max their meat so that they can...

2331
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:12,900
I just realized.

2332
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,480
What is this one in English?

2333
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:16,440
Because I just keep calling it meat.

2334
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:19,060
And I'm like, let's max your meat out.

2335
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:24,520
What is this one in English, though?

2336
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:31,400
What is it called in English?

2337
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:33,760
Oh, it is meat?

2338
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:34,980
Oh, okay, okay.

2339
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:35,840
That's so funny.

2340
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:37,020
Meat maxing.

2341
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,380
We're meat maxing?

2342
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,200
We're meat maxing?

2343
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:44,700
Isn't Christopher Robin, he does, like, all of the different throws, right?

2344
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:46,920
Okay, let's see.

2345
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:48,860
One, two.

2346
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,540
I can't tell if I'm missing...

2347
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:52,040
One, two!

2348
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:56,160
Okay, maybe it's one, two.

2349
02:18:58,040 --> 02:18:58,440
Two!

2350
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:01,900
I didn't even say the word.

2351
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:03,740
Two!

2352
02:19:03,740 --> 02:19:04,180
One, two!

2353
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:07,620
One, two!

2354
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:12,280
Yeah, we need to hit 28 of these.

2355
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:12,980
One, two!

2356
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:16,440
One, two!

2357
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:21,580
This is winnable.

2358
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:23,600
One, two!

2359
02:19:29,110 --> 02:19:29,870
One, two!

2360
02:19:30,250 --> 02:19:32,330
The ref is... or the ump is against me!

2361
02:19:32,630 --> 02:19:33,330
One, two!

2362
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:38,150
This is still winnable.

2363
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:40,630
One, two!

2364
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:44,010
This is still winnable.

2365
02:19:47,070 --> 02:19:48,050
One, two!

2366
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,390
One, two!

2367
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:54,550
One, two!

2368
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:56,590
It's not winnable anymore.

2369
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,850
One, two!

2370
02:20:03,310 --> 02:20:04,330
One, two!

2371
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:06,050
Is it a piki-piki?

2372
02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:07,630
Yeah, it's like Tengoku rhythm.

2373
02:20:08,690 --> 02:20:09,310
Hey, Esu.

2374
02:20:10,690 --> 02:20:11,610
One, two!

2375
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:12,670
Ow.

2376
02:20:12,930 --> 02:20:13,490
Foul.

2377
02:20:15,870 --> 02:20:16,790
One, two!

2378
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:22,820
One, two!

2379
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:30,130
One, two!

2380
02:20:31,210 --> 02:20:34,270
Okay, we can do this you guys.

2381
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:35,170
We can do this, I think.

2382
02:20:36,130 --> 02:20:36,970
One, two!

2383
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,290
Ah...

2384
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:42,070
One, two!

2385
02:20:44,850 --> 02:20:46,690
Is he throwing at different speeds?

2386
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:47,750
He does, yes.

2387
02:20:48,950 --> 02:20:51,730
See, that's why sometimes it's slower though.

2388
02:20:54,910 --> 02:20:57,810
Oh, I was too far out.

2389
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:06,660
Maybe it's not winnable.

2390
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:07,500
I don't know.

2391
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:13,920
Another foul.

2392
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:17,060
Shame, shame, shame.

2393
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:18,360
One, two!

2394
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:20,020
Is that another foul?

2395
02:21:20,140 --> 02:21:20,280
Nope.

2396
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,390
Count from when the ball disappears?

2397
02:21:27,730 --> 02:21:28,450
That's too hard for me.

2398
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:29,070
One, two!

2399
02:21:30,090 --> 02:21:31,410
I count from when he throws.

2400
02:21:31,570 --> 02:21:32,210
There's no difference.

2401
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:33,750
There's no difference.

2402
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:36,350
One, two!

2403
02:21:38,670 --> 02:21:39,730
One, two!

2404
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:43,150
One, two!

2405
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:44,270
One,

2406
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:49,990
two!

2407
02:21:51,930 --> 02:21:52,530
Pocky!

2408
02:21:55,330 --> 02:21:56,050
One, two!

2409
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:09,860
New record.

2410
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,720
New record, new record, new record, new record.

2411
02:22:16,220 --> 02:22:16,820
Eleven.

2412
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:21,940
Oh, oops.

2413
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:22,880
My bad, my bad.

2414
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:26,960
I'm like... I'm just pressing buttons at this point.

2415
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,040
One, two!

2416
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:33,300
Aha!

2417
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:37,520
One, two!

2418
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:39,600
Haha!

2419
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:44,990
One, two!

2420
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:46,410
Haha!

2421
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:52,620
One, two!

2422
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:55,680
One, two!

2423
02:22:56,620 --> 02:22:57,160
One,

2424
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,990
two!

2425
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:08,030
It's just a slower one, two.

2426
02:23:09,570 --> 02:23:10,390
One, two!

2427
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:13,890
Haha!

2428
02:23:16,350 --> 02:23:17,870
One, two!

2429
02:23:18,290 --> 02:23:19,070
Oh, foul.

2430
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:19,730
My bad.

2431
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:23,010
One, two!

2432
02:23:24,190 --> 02:23:24,790
Sorry.

2433
02:23:25,630 --> 02:23:26,810
One, two!

2434
02:23:27,230 --> 02:23:30,070
One, two!

2435
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:33,410
One, two!

2436
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:34,350
Haha!

2437
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,260
One, two!

2438
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:03,440
Haha!

2439
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:04,420
Haha!

2440
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:09,780
One, two!

2441
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:10,440
Oh!

2442
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:11,500
Haha!

2443
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,960
One, two!

2444
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:16,120
Haha!

2445
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:17,020
Haha!

2446
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:22,260
One, two!

2447
02:24:27,710 --> 02:24:28,370
Haha!

2448
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:29,110
One, two!

2449
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:41,600
Haha!

2450
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:42,320
Haha!

2451
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:43,160
One,

2452
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:53,060
two!

2453
02:24:59,470 --> 02:25:00,710
Is this still winnable?

2454
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:01,110
I don't know.

2455
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:02,770
One, two... Uh-oh.

2456
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:05,630
One, two...

2457
02:25:08,590 --> 02:25:09,710
One, two...

2458
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:16,090
One, two... We got close though.

2459
02:25:16,270 --> 02:25:17,890
Well not close, but we got pretty far.

2460
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:19,570
We got pretty far.

2461
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:22,550
One, two...

2462
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:27,850
It's Jover.

2463
02:25:29,170 --> 02:25:30,290
It's Jover.

2464
02:25:33,730 --> 02:25:35,230
You can restart it?

2465
02:25:35,330 --> 02:25:36,850
I don't think you can actually.

2466
02:25:37,050 --> 02:25:39,670
Like when the ghost lady makes silly noises.

2467
02:25:41,090 --> 02:25:43,690
One, two... That one was too slow.

2468
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:46,010
You're too slow!

2469
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:49,630
I wonder if we can get to at least 20.

2470
02:25:50,170 --> 02:25:51,330
Yeah, good practice.

2471
02:25:51,890 --> 02:25:53,290
One, two...

2472
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:00,820
One, two...

2473
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:06,760
One, two...

2474
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:10,020
Yay, we made it to 20.

2475
02:26:14,770 --> 02:26:15,650
One, two...

2476
02:26:21,870 --> 02:26:22,750
One, two...

2477
02:26:26,130 --> 02:26:27,190
I don't know about you.

2478
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:29,310
I'm feeling 22.

2479
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:32,550
Honestly, decent run.

2480
02:26:32,730 --> 02:26:33,490
Yeah, for real.

2481
02:26:43,650 --> 02:26:44,530
One, two...

2482
02:26:45,150 --> 02:26:48,150
Sorry, it is so annoying probably me doing this, but I have to.

2483
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:51,630
One, two...

2484
02:26:51,850 --> 02:26:52,970
Oh, I think I was too far away.

2485
02:26:54,330 --> 02:26:55,130
One, two...

2486
02:26:55,970 --> 02:26:56,370
Foul.

2487
02:26:56,930 --> 02:26:57,450
Dang it.

2488
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:01,500
One, two...

2489
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:02,800
That was too far away.

2490
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,400
One, two...

2491
02:27:12,180 --> 02:27:12,980
One, two...

2492
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:15,800
One, two...

2493
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:18,380
Switch to Nihongo?

2494
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:19,200
I don't think so.

2495
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:21,680
I think this is how I gotta do it.

2496
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:24,420
One, two... Shit, I was too far away.

2497
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:26,320
One, two...

2498
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,260
How long has she been on Tigger?

2499
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:32,340
Not very long actually.

2500
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:33,840
One, two...

2501
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,320
I just got to Tigger.

2502
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:39,060
One, two...

2503
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:43,340
One, two...

2504
02:27:49,170 --> 02:27:50,210
One, two...

2505
02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:53,970
Yeah, Owl kind of did me in.

2506
02:27:54,090 --> 02:27:55,790
Owl did me in a little bit.

2507
02:27:55,870 --> 02:27:57,490
One, two... Shoot.

2508
02:27:59,310 --> 02:28:00,350
One, two...

2509
02:28:01,390 --> 02:28:03,210
It was like coming towards me.

2510
02:28:04,010 --> 02:28:05,210
One, two...

2511
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,170
Uh-oh.

2512
02:28:06,270 --> 02:28:07,010
Uh-oh.

2513
02:28:07,070 --> 02:28:07,790
Is it still winnable?

2514
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:09,810
Nope.

2515
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:15,290
Kind of, but very difficult.

2516
02:28:15,630 --> 02:28:16,950
Okay, now it's not winnable.

2517
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:22,270
Now, it's not winnable.

2518
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:24,550
It's okay.

2519
02:28:25,150 --> 02:28:25,950
It's alright.

2520
02:28:26,610 --> 02:28:27,410
It's okay.

2521
02:28:29,050 --> 02:28:29,570
It's alright.

2522
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:31,390
It's okay.

2523
02:28:32,090 --> 02:28:32,670
It's alright.

2524
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:36,970
Actually, while he does this, I'm gonna go get more tea while he runs out of balls.

2525
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:38,790
I'll be right back.

2526
02:28:38,810 --> 02:28:39,690
I'm gonna get more drink.

2527
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:41,570
You can watch him.

2528
02:31:28,130 --> 02:31:29,550
Guys, I went on an adventure.

2529
02:31:31,950 --> 02:31:33,330
I said I was just gonna get tea.

2530
02:31:33,450 --> 02:31:33,930
I lied.

2531
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:37,970
I also...

2532
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:39,690
Went to the bathroom.

2533
02:31:39,930 --> 02:31:41,090
And I also...

2534
02:31:42,170 --> 02:31:42,610
Um...

2535
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:44,590
Got a snack.

2536
02:31:45,650 --> 02:31:46,850
But right now...

2537
02:31:46,850 --> 02:31:49,050
I was like trying to decide if I wanted tea.

2538
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:51,170
But I'm gonna put some of this throat stuff.

2539
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:53,070
Since I've been yelling a lot.

2540
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:55,150
And since my throat is not very good today.

2541
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:56,390
And I need to stop yelling.

2542
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:58,190
If I yell...

2543
02:31:58,190 --> 02:31:59,430
Yell back at me.

2544
02:31:59,730 --> 02:32:00,370
Say, Minto!

2545
02:32:00,990 --> 02:32:01,430
Yell.

2546
02:32:02,770 --> 02:32:03,210
Don't.

2547
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:03,450
Don't.

2548
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:04,130
Your throat.

2549
02:32:04,190 --> 02:32:05,530
You must recover your throat.

2550
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:07,910
And I'll be like, yes ma.

2551
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:09,730
Did you wash your hands?

2552
02:32:09,830 --> 02:32:10,210
Always.

2553
02:32:10,910 --> 02:32:13,150
I always wash my hands.

2554
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:17,170
I'm pouring in this stuff for my tea.

2555
02:32:17,310 --> 02:32:18,010
Or, it's not tea.

2556
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:19,550
Well, I guess it turns into tea.

2557
02:32:19,870 --> 02:32:21,230
But it's throat stuff.

2558
02:32:25,110 --> 02:32:29,770
While you are taking a break from your suffering, I just want to wish you a good time at Otakutan.

2559
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:30,970
I will be there!

2560
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:33,190
I'll see you there, Virulent!

2561
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:35,250
I'll see you!

2562
02:32:35,510 --> 02:32:36,340
I'm so excited.

2563
02:32:36,890 --> 02:32:37,710
Oh my gosh.

2564
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:39,430
This weekend I'm going to Canada.

2565
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:39,610
Canada.

2566
02:32:40,130 --> 02:32:42,570
Oh, Canada.

2567
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:48,770
Yeah, look after yourself, nerd!

2568
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:52,130
I know I had to record some stuff.

2569
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:56,890
One thing I had to record was for our... my duet with Doki.

2570
02:32:59,470 --> 02:33:00,770
At the concert.

2571
02:33:02,050 --> 02:33:02,970
Next weekend.

2572
02:33:03,430 --> 02:33:04,530
Not this coming weekend.

2573
02:33:06,530 --> 02:33:07,090
And...

2574
02:33:09,650 --> 02:33:11,730
And, sorry, you had to listen to this music.

2575
02:33:11,830 --> 02:33:13,330
I had my headphones off.

2576
02:33:14,550 --> 02:33:19,830
But I was like, oh boy, my voice is not very...

2577
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:20,770
One, two.

2578
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:24,350
My voice is not in good condition.

2579
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:27,870
I had to record some other stuff, so I was like...

2580
02:33:27,870 --> 02:33:29,670
I was like...

2581
02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:32,430
Oh gosh, okay.

2582
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:34,770
One, two.

2583
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:35,490
Uh-oh.

2584
02:33:35,490 --> 02:33:36,910
Uh-oh.

2585
02:33:36,990 --> 02:33:38,050
One, two.

2586
02:33:38,470 --> 02:33:39,050
Uh-oh.

2587
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:41,310
One, two.

2588
02:33:42,050 --> 02:33:42,930
You guys.

2589
02:33:43,790 --> 02:33:44,810
One, two.

2590
02:33:46,570 --> 02:33:47,430
What's happening?

2591
02:33:58,790 --> 02:34:01,630
Now I was recording for something that hasn't been...

2592
02:34:02,510 --> 02:34:03,530
announced yet.

2593
02:34:06,230 --> 02:34:06,850
Mysterious.

2594
02:34:07,590 --> 02:34:09,690
One, two.

2595
02:34:12,330 --> 02:34:13,550
Get that rhythm back.

2596
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:17,170
One, two.

2597
02:34:18,470 --> 02:34:18,990
Foul?

2598
02:34:22,050 --> 02:34:23,150
One, two.

2599
02:34:23,510 --> 02:34:24,290
That was fast.

2600
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:26,390
One, two.

2601
02:34:28,670 --> 02:34:29,550
One, two.

2602
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:34,550
Who is Juan and why are you telling him to chew?

2603
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:37,010
One, two.

2604
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:44,520
One, two.

2605
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:46,840
How many honeypots do we need to eat?

2606
02:34:47,940 --> 02:34:48,500
Two.

2607
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:50,840
To get to 169.

2608
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:58,260
Two.

2609
02:35:02,220 --> 02:35:04,500
Mint and Henny's winter podcast.

2610
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:08,020
I think I'm done with podcasts after this one.

2611
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:12,880
I really appreciate everybody who says that they enjoy listening to our podcast.

2612
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,540
Oh gosh, I can't make any...

2613
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:17,560
mistakes or else...

2614
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:18,700
the run is over.

2615
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:22,540
But I think after the podcast...

2616
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:24,220
I...

2617
02:35:24,220 --> 02:35:24,980
Oh, that's it.

2618
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,180
The run is over.

2619
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:28,600
I prefer streaming over...

2620
02:35:29,240 --> 02:35:30,880
over the podcast stuff.

2621
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:33,100
But

2622
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:40,960
I'm really glad that people...

2623
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:42,620
like it.

2624
02:35:44,260 --> 02:35:46,820
Is this a prequel to Poo, Blood and Honey?

2625
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,140
Is that the horror film?

2626
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,500
Oops.

2627
02:35:56,590 --> 02:35:57,030
Yeah.

2628
02:35:58,190 --> 02:35:59,590
Understandable, but I'm happy you tried it.

2629
02:35:59,630 --> 02:36:00,170
Yeah, me too.

2630
02:36:00,290 --> 02:36:01,470
Otherwise, I never would have...

2631
02:36:02,110 --> 02:36:03,090
I never would have...

2632
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:04,050
known, you know?

2633
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:15,700
So, yeah.

2634
02:36:16,580 --> 02:36:17,320
One, two.

2635
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:18,120
Nope.

2636
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:20,540
One, two.

2637
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:21,520
Why am I...

2638
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:22,840
What's happening to the timing?

2639
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:23,960
One, two.

2640
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:29,780
One, two.

2641
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:30,920
Which is kind of crazy.

2642
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:31,780
Like, you know...

2643
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,520
I thought because...

2644
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,860
you know, a podcast is just...

2645
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:39,240
talking and streaming is also just talking.

2646
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,660
Why would I like one and not the other?

2647
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:42,200
But...

2648
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:44,800
It's so strange that I...

2649
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:46,660
don't really...

2650
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:48,480
care so much for the podcast.

2651
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:49,800
Not that I don't care about it.

2652
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:50,680
That's not the right word.

2653
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:51,020
It's...

2654
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:52,460
It's that, you know, I...

2655
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:54,860
I will have done it and I'll be like...

2656
02:36:54,860 --> 02:36:55,780
Yeah, that was fun.

2657
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:57,420
But I think I'm good to...

2658
02:36:57,420 --> 02:36:58,240
you know, stream.

2659
02:37:01,700 --> 02:37:02,180
Yeah.

2660
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:03,480
And...

2661
02:37:06,380 --> 02:37:07,460
What was I gonna say?

2662
02:37:11,220 --> 02:37:12,260
One, two.

2663
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:13,600
That's what I was gonna say.

2664
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:15,700
But it's funny because like when I...

2665
02:37:15,700 --> 02:37:16,760
was like doing...

2666
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:18,620
started VTubing, like some people...

2667
02:37:18,620 --> 02:37:19,680
One, two.

2668
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:20,240
Nope.

2669
02:37:20,380 --> 02:37:22,220
When they start VTubing, they...

2670
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:23,220
One, two.

2671
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:24,060
Nah.

2672
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:25,000
They...

2673
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,980
At least stream a little bit before they become a VTuber.

2674
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:28,440
Two.

2675
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:30,080
Dang it.

2676
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:32,380
But for me, I was just like, nah.

2677
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,800
One, two.

2678
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:36,380
I'm gonna be a VTuber.

2679
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:38,740
So...

2680
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:40,260
One, two.

2681
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,880
What if I had hated streaming too?

2682
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:43,720
One, two.

2683
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:46,380
What if I had hated streaming?

2684
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:51,210
One, two.

2685
02:37:53,070 --> 02:37:53,550
No.

2686
02:37:55,070 --> 02:37:56,270
That wasn't a foul.

2687
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:57,590
Two.

2688
02:37:59,190 --> 02:38:00,670
Back to the business minds.

2689
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:03,930
Utaite.

2690
02:38:04,190 --> 02:38:04,930
One, two.

2691
02:38:05,330 --> 02:38:06,590
No, I don't think so.

2692
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:09,110
I already don't put out.

2693
02:38:09,170 --> 02:38:10,190
One, two.

2694
02:38:10,370 --> 02:38:12,110
A lot of covers, so...

2695
02:38:14,830 --> 02:38:16,070
I think there is a lot of...

2696
02:38:16,810 --> 02:38:17,710
One, two.

2697
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:19,990
A lot of pressure with being utaite.

2698
02:38:20,610 --> 02:38:21,690
Troy, thanks for the gift.

2699
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:23,590
I actually got something recently.

2700
02:38:23,870 --> 02:38:24,430
Hold on.

2701
02:38:24,450 --> 02:38:24,950
One, two.

2702
02:38:25,890 --> 02:38:27,890
When Barry and I were at MGSCon.

2703
02:38:28,330 --> 02:38:28,730
Um.

2704
02:38:28,930 --> 02:38:29,430
One second.

2705
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:30,550
One, two.

2706
02:38:30,570 --> 02:38:30,650
I actually got something recently.

2707
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:37,030
We were at the voice actor panel and someone asked...

2708
02:38:37,030 --> 02:38:39,810
You know, someone always asks, like, how do you keep your voice, like, well?

2709
02:38:40,390 --> 02:38:41,290
One, two!

2710
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:42,190
Dang it.

2711
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:44,450
One, two!

2712
02:38:44,830 --> 02:38:45,110
No?

2713
02:38:46,930 --> 02:38:47,850
One, two!

2714
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:51,630
And, um...

2715
02:38:52,610 --> 02:38:53,530
Lori Allen...

2716
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:55,070
One, two!

2717
02:38:55,530 --> 02:38:57,570
Mentioned that she uses a singing straw.

2718
02:38:57,850 --> 02:39:01,630
And I remember Barry and I both looked at each other at the same exact time and we're like...

2719
02:39:01,630 --> 02:39:02,530
One, two!

2720
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:04,650
No, we did not say that.

2721
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:07,870
We...

2722
02:39:07,870 --> 02:39:08,630
One, two!

2723
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:10,690
We looked at each other at the same...

2724
02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:11,530
Okay, the run is over.

2725
02:39:11,830 --> 02:39:14,010
But we were just like, a singing straw?

2726
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:15,430
What the heck is that?

2727
02:39:16,890 --> 02:39:18,830
And so, I, like, looked it up.

2728
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:20,130
And then I bought one.

2729
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:23,570
And it's supposed to help with, like, your breathing.

2730
02:39:24,210 --> 02:39:28,070
And also for, like, increasing the power of your voice.

2731
02:39:28,770 --> 02:39:29,830
Which I was like, wow!

2732
02:39:30,210 --> 02:39:30,370
What?

2733
02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:31,670
One, two!

2734
02:39:33,770 --> 02:39:34,410
So...

2735
02:39:35,930 --> 02:39:37,090
I'm gonna try it.

2736
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:41,340
How does that work?

2737
02:39:41,460 --> 02:39:42,520
I have no idea.

2738
02:39:43,020 --> 02:39:44,280
I have no idea.

2739
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:49,800
One, two!

2740
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,140
One, two!

2741
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:56,860
A singing straw.

2742
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,060
One, two!

2743
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:02,380
Yeah, but mine is a little different.

2744
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:03,980
I got this thing called...

2745
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:05,960
The sing ring.

2746
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:09,160
And basically, you, like, hold it in your middle finger.

2747
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:10,360
And then you cover up some of the holes.

2748
02:40:10,500 --> 02:40:11,900
And then you, like, sing into it.

2749
02:40:11,980 --> 02:40:13,240
And it kind of creates, like, a resistance.

2750
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:23,600
Like that.

2751
02:40:23,720 --> 02:40:25,740
And it, like, helps, like, you create...

2752
02:40:25,740 --> 02:40:27,700
Like, helps you sing more...

2753
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:30,340
Like, or rather, helps you regulate your breathing better.

2754
02:40:30,700 --> 02:40:31,980
And also helps you...

2755
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:33,960
Yeah, it's like a kazoo.

2756
02:40:34,700 --> 02:40:35,100
But...

2757
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:37,200
It's like a kazoo, but if it had...

2758
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:39,760
If it had resistance.

2759
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:44,500
So, like, almost, it almost feels like it's gonna, like...

2760
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:46,900
Make my diaphragm like strong.

2761
02:40:48,220 --> 02:40:50,160
My diaphragm's gonna be so meaty.

2762
02:40:51,240 --> 02:40:52,340
It's gonna be so...

2763
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:52,440
Oh.

2764
02:40:54,020 --> 02:40:54,420
Shoot.

2765
02:40:55,640 --> 02:40:56,760
Okay, time to pay attention.

2766
02:40:57,980 --> 02:40:58,780
One, two!

2767
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:03,880
Minto abs.

2768
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:09,480
Golly, I need the abs.

2769
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:16,080
I've been slacking on exercising, you guys.

2770
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:22,120
I'm gaining too much ectoplasm.

2771
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:30,300
Which is why I'm kind of excited about being in Japan for a month, because I'll just be walk, walk, walking every day.

2772
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:32,720
One, two.

2773
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:33,380
Oh, shoot.

2774
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:36,220
One, two.

2775
02:41:42,530 --> 02:41:43,730
One, two.

2776
02:41:44,030 --> 02:41:44,530
Dang it.

2777
02:41:45,950 --> 02:41:46,950
One, two.

2778
02:41:48,690 --> 02:41:49,370
Ring Fit.

2779
02:41:49,610 --> 02:41:53,350
Maybe once I get a better 3D tracking, I can do Ring Fit.

2780
02:41:53,570 --> 02:41:54,370
One, two.

2781
02:41:54,370 --> 02:41:54,730
Two.

2782
02:41:57,410 --> 02:42:00,470
I think also, you know, stress will always like...

2783
02:42:02,470 --> 02:42:02,990
Two.

2784
02:42:02,990 --> 02:42:05,430
Stress does a number on your body.

2785
02:42:07,550 --> 02:42:08,070
So...

2786
02:42:09,730 --> 02:42:11,090
Laugh and grow fat.

2787
02:42:11,850 --> 02:42:13,550
I'm doing maybe both of those.

2788
02:42:16,110 --> 02:42:18,070
Usually I'd say I'm doing one of them.

2789
02:42:19,310 --> 02:42:19,830
Two.

2790
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:20,090
Two.

2791
02:42:22,490 --> 02:42:25,670
And then once, I think once I have more 3D, I'll be...

2792
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:26,690
Two.

2793
02:42:26,970 --> 02:42:29,250
More motivated too, because I'll want to learn...

2794
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:31,570
Dances and stuff.

2795
02:42:31,690 --> 02:42:32,530
You know, like that.

2796
02:42:34,670 --> 02:42:35,070
One.

2797
02:42:35,390 --> 02:42:35,790
Two.

2798
02:42:36,890 --> 02:42:38,170
This is not the run, you guys.

2799
02:42:38,210 --> 02:42:38,630
Oh god.

2800
02:42:39,010 --> 02:42:40,310
For someone who I...

2801
02:42:40,970 --> 02:42:41,370
Two.

2802
02:42:42,070 --> 02:42:45,130
I believe to scream a lot and go nuts during Wotagei.

2803
02:42:45,350 --> 02:42:48,590
Metal Gear Unveilings and Limp Bizkit songs.

2804
02:42:48,650 --> 02:42:49,810
You seem to take care of your voice.

2805
02:42:49,830 --> 02:42:51,490
Chords pretty well.

2806
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:52,310
Thanks!

2807
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:53,350
I try.

2808
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:56,550
I try, I try.

2809
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:59,770
I try, I try.

2810
02:43:00,090 --> 02:43:01,170
I try, I try.

2811
02:43:02,270 --> 02:43:03,210
I try, I try.

2812
02:43:03,210 --> 02:43:04,090
Get your steps in, Minto.

2813
02:43:04,310 --> 02:43:04,990
I need to.

2814
02:43:06,090 --> 02:43:09,110
But at MGS Con, the first day, I got...

2815
02:43:09,110 --> 02:43:10,930
I got 20,000 steps in.

2816
02:43:11,630 --> 02:43:13,030
I did 9 miles.

2817
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:16,230
I did a lot.

2818
02:43:17,610 --> 02:43:18,170
So...

2819
02:43:22,310 --> 02:43:25,310
And then the day after, it was like 16,000.

2820
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:28,710
What do you mean the first day?

2821
02:43:28,990 --> 02:43:31,010
Like the day I flew in.

2822
02:43:31,070 --> 02:43:32,070
The day I flew in.

2823
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:35,330
The day of the con, it was like 16,000.

2824
02:43:36,850 --> 02:43:37,290
Two!

2825
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:39,250
My Oshi soft in the middle.

2826
02:43:39,330 --> 02:43:39,770
Stop!

2827
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:41,730
I hate it.

2828
02:43:45,110 --> 02:43:46,110
I hate it.

2829
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:51,480
It all just goes to my butt.

2830
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:52,380
Anyway.

2831
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:58,120
We use a PVC ball valve for breathing exercises.

2832
02:43:58,640 --> 02:43:59,020
Huh?

2833
02:43:59,900 --> 02:44:00,780
What's that?

2834
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:07,740
Soft girl summer.

2835
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:09,860
Soft girl summer.

2836
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:16,690
Why are you guys saying...

2837
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:18,750
You guys are like making it feel like...

2838
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:20,510
I'm like...

2839
02:44:20,510 --> 02:44:22,830
So, you know...

2840
02:44:22,830 --> 02:44:24,110
I'm just...

2841
02:44:24,110 --> 02:44:25,470
It's just a little bit, you guys.

2842
02:44:25,990 --> 02:44:26,350
I...

2843
02:44:27,730 --> 02:44:29,270
I wouldn't even say I'm chubby.

2844
02:44:29,810 --> 02:44:30,170
Okay?

2845
02:44:31,910 --> 02:44:33,770
I even asked my friend the other day.

2846
02:44:33,810 --> 02:44:34,850
I was like, am I chubby?

2847
02:44:35,150 --> 02:44:36,690
And they were like, no, you're not.

2848
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:39,590
I was like, okay, thank you.

2849
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:51,140
Stage 7.

2850
02:44:57,130 --> 02:44:57,490
Gosh.

2851
02:44:58,630 --> 02:44:59,450
Caught me off guard.

2852
02:44:59,610 --> 02:45:00,270
Caught me off guard.

2853
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:00,990
Caught me off guard.

2854
02:45:02,190 --> 02:45:02,730
Two.

2855
02:45:03,090 --> 02:45:04,010
Come on.

2856
02:45:06,750 --> 02:45:07,290
One.

2857
02:45:07,630 --> 02:45:08,170
Two.

2858
02:45:10,490 --> 02:45:11,030
One.

2859
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:11,810
Two.

2860
02:45:15,810 --> 02:45:16,350
One.

2861
02:45:16,530 --> 02:45:17,070
Two.

2862
02:45:30,030 --> 02:45:32,710
Alright, can we get off the topic of my weight, please?

2863
02:45:33,030 --> 02:45:34,410
Alright, can we get off the topic of my weight, please?

2864
02:45:34,410 --> 02:45:34,690
One.

2865
02:45:34,890 --> 02:45:35,410
Two.

2866
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:37,750
Can we actually...

2867
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:38,390
One.

2868
02:45:38,390 --> 02:45:38,850
Two.

2869
02:45:38,890 --> 02:45:40,590
I don't want to think about it.

2870
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:54,470
One.

2871
02:45:54,470 --> 02:45:54,910
Two.

2872
02:45:56,830 --> 02:45:57,470
One.

2873
02:45:57,470 --> 02:45:57,470
Two.

2874
02:45:57,470 --> 02:45:58,210
Ghosts are weightless.

2875
02:45:58,450 --> 02:45:58,710
Ghosts are weightless.

2876
02:45:58,710 --> 02:45:59,050
It's true.

2877
02:45:59,270 --> 02:46:00,850
I put it in my debut.

2878
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:02,310
Two.

2879
02:46:02,630 --> 02:46:03,830
I weigh zero pounds.

2880
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:07,970
Ectoplasm now weighs nothing.

2881
02:46:08,290 --> 02:46:08,490
Ectoplasm now weighs nothing.

2882
02:46:08,630 --> 02:46:09,270
One.

2883
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:09,830
Two.

2884
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:10,810
Dang it.

2885
02:46:12,350 --> 02:46:12,990
One.

2886
02:46:15,230 --> 02:46:15,730
Two.

2887
02:46:17,650 --> 02:46:18,290
One.

2888
02:46:18,430 --> 02:46:18,930
Two.

2889
02:46:19,290 --> 02:46:19,750
One.

2890
02:46:19,750 --> 02:46:19,750
Two.

2891
02:46:20,450 --> 02:46:21,090
One.

2892
02:46:21,290 --> 02:46:21,650
Two.

2893
02:46:21,670 --> 02:46:21,770
One.

2894
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:22,090
Two.

2895
02:46:23,610 --> 02:46:25,950
Big supporter of the straw for vocal warm-ups.

2896
02:46:26,370 --> 02:46:27,150
Oh, nice.

2897
02:46:28,430 --> 02:46:28,870
One.

2898
02:46:28,890 --> 02:46:29,310
Two.

2899
02:46:29,930 --> 02:46:32,950
It's not exactly... I wanted to find a straw, but I couldn't find a straw.

2900
02:46:33,330 --> 02:46:33,770
One.

2901
02:46:34,650 --> 02:46:35,090
Two.

2902
02:46:35,610 --> 02:46:35,830
One.

2903
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:35,830
Two.

2904
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:37,690
I want to have more and more thick mental arts.

2905
02:46:37,810 --> 02:46:38,590
Please stop.

2906
02:46:40,250 --> 02:46:41,130
Actually, please stop.

2907
02:46:41,650 --> 02:46:42,270
Thank you.

2908
02:46:59,090 --> 02:46:59,530
One.

2909
02:46:59,530 --> 02:46:59,930
Two.

2910
02:47:01,050 --> 02:47:03,410
What game would you not want to be Jumanji'd into?

2911
02:47:03,850 --> 02:47:04,290
One.

2912
02:47:04,930 --> 02:47:04,930
Two.

2913
02:47:04,930 --> 02:47:04,930
What game would you not want to be Jumanji'd into?

2914
02:47:06,270 --> 02:47:06,950
One.

2915
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:07,470
Two.

2916
02:47:07,570 --> 02:47:07,850
One.

2917
02:47:07,850 --> 02:47:07,850
Two.

2918
02:47:07,850 --> 02:47:08,990
Like Fallout or something.

2919
02:47:09,530 --> 02:47:10,210
One.

2920
02:47:10,270 --> 02:47:10,730
Two.

2921
02:47:11,570 --> 02:47:12,250
One.

2922
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:14,370
Two.

2923
02:47:14,370 --> 02:47:14,550
One.

2924
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:14,550
Two.

2925
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:15,550
Oh, this is not winnable.

2926
02:47:15,730 --> 02:47:16,330
I just realized.

2927
02:47:16,810 --> 02:47:20,390
I'm so distracted that I'm like not even...

2928
02:47:20,390 --> 02:47:21,270
I'm so distracted that I'm like not even...

2929
02:47:21,270 --> 02:47:24,250
I'm barely paying attention to Tigger.

2930
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:24,530
I'm barely paying attention to Tigger.

2931
02:47:24,530 --> 02:47:24,690
Two.

2932
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:31,790
One.

2933
02:47:31,790 --> 02:47:32,470
Two.

2934
02:47:34,470 --> 02:47:35,150
One.

2935
02:47:35,270 --> 02:47:35,710
Two.

2936
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:36,770
One.

2937
02:47:37,690 --> 02:47:37,830
Two.

2938
02:47:37,830 --> 02:47:38,010
Two.

2939
02:47:40,870 --> 02:47:41,430
Two.

2940
02:47:41,550 --> 02:47:42,610
Home Run Derby.

2941
02:47:53,130 --> 02:47:54,870
Did you roll for Dress Hina?

2942
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:56,610
Yeah.

2943
02:47:57,050 --> 02:47:58,070
I got her.

2944
02:48:02,210 --> 02:48:03,690
I got Dress Hina.

2945
02:48:04,530 --> 02:48:05,790
I got Dress Hina.

2946
02:48:05,790 --> 02:48:06,650
And Summer Hoshino.

2947
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:07,070
And Summer Hoshino.

2948
02:48:11,650 --> 02:48:12,110
Yeah.

2949
02:48:12,210 --> 02:48:12,610
Okay.

2950
02:48:14,350 --> 02:48:15,490
Game is over!

2951
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:19,630
Game is over!

2952
02:48:19,630 --> 02:48:19,770
Yeah.

2953
02:48:19,850 --> 02:48:20,390
I got Hoshino.

2954
02:48:20,690 --> 02:48:21,710
And I got Hina.

2955
02:48:25,790 --> 02:48:26,250
Okay.

2956
02:48:26,870 --> 02:48:28,790
I got 90 rolls and didn't get her.

2957
02:48:30,070 --> 02:48:30,530
One.

2958
02:48:30,710 --> 02:48:31,150
Two.

2959
02:48:31,510 --> 02:48:33,750
It took me like a hundred and twenty, my friend.

2960
02:48:35,630 --> 02:48:36,550
It took me like a hundred and twenty, my friend.

2961
02:48:36,550 --> 02:48:37,370
You don't want my luck.

2962
02:48:37,510 --> 02:48:37,730
One.

2963
02:48:38,010 --> 02:48:38,470
Two.

2964
02:48:38,910 --> 02:48:39,670
Oh, come on.

2965
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:43,030
That was the same type of throw.

2966
02:48:43,170 --> 02:48:43,230
That was the same type of throw.

2967
02:48:43,230 --> 02:48:43,550
One.

2968
02:48:43,750 --> 02:48:44,110
Two.

2969
02:48:46,210 --> 02:48:46,830
One.

2970
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:47,470
Two.

2971
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:50,070
One.

2972
02:48:50,250 --> 02:48:50,750
Two.

2973
02:48:51,270 --> 02:48:51,730
One.

2974
02:48:51,730 --> 02:48:51,730
Two.

2975
02:48:51,730 --> 02:48:53,790
Sounds like you need more Blue Archive funds.

2976
02:48:54,030 --> 02:48:54,470
No!

2977
02:48:54,910 --> 02:48:56,630
I'm mostly free to play.

2978
02:48:57,010 --> 02:48:57,630
One.

2979
02:48:57,630 --> 02:48:57,950
Two.

2980
02:48:58,310 --> 02:48:59,090
Dang it.

2981
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:01,690
Meh.

2982
02:49:02,570 --> 02:49:03,190
One.

2983
02:49:03,410 --> 02:49:03,790
Two.

2984
02:49:06,970 --> 02:49:07,590
Mostly.

2985
02:49:07,910 --> 02:49:09,790
I pay ten dollars a month.

2986
02:49:10,010 --> 02:49:10,590
One.

2987
02:49:10,730 --> 02:49:11,190
Two.

2988
02:49:11,710 --> 02:49:12,510
For the...

2989
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:15,530
For the monthly package.

2990
02:49:16,990 --> 02:49:17,550
One.

2991
02:49:17,630 --> 02:49:18,130
Two.

2992
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:19,210
But that's all I buy.

2993
02:49:20,690 --> 02:49:21,250
One.

2994
02:49:21,250 --> 02:49:21,550
Two.

2995
02:49:23,670 --> 02:49:24,230
One.

2996
02:49:24,370 --> 02:49:24,730
Two.

2997
02:49:25,290 --> 02:49:27,490
Because I think that is a good deal.

2998
02:49:30,850 --> 02:49:31,410
One.

2999
02:49:31,410 --> 02:49:31,970
Two.

3000
02:49:32,130 --> 02:49:32,670
Oh.

3001
02:49:34,150 --> 02:49:34,710
One.

3002
02:49:34,830 --> 02:49:35,270
Two.

3003
02:49:35,350 --> 02:49:37,410
I don't think I've ever been super...

3004
02:49:37,410 --> 02:49:40,750
Like so deep in a gacha that I would be willing to...

3005
02:49:41,710 --> 02:49:42,190
One.

3006
02:49:42,190 --> 02:49:42,610
Two.

3007
02:49:43,250 --> 02:49:46,230
That I'd be willing to spend so much money on it.

3008
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:47,830
Two.

3009
02:49:47,990 --> 02:49:48,510
Dang it.

3010
02:49:48,570 --> 02:49:49,450
That one was really far over.

3011
02:49:50,150 --> 02:49:50,670
One.

3012
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:51,070
Two.

3013
02:49:51,270 --> 02:49:51,710
Dang it.

3014
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:53,230
One.

3015
02:49:53,890 --> 02:49:54,410
Two.

3016
02:49:55,790 --> 02:49:59,490
Because I know that gachas end one day.

3017
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:01,250
One.

3018
02:50:01,250 --> 02:50:01,770
Two.

3019
02:50:01,890 --> 02:50:03,210
And it freaks me out.

3020
02:50:04,910 --> 02:50:06,190
It freaks me out.

3021
02:50:06,290 --> 02:50:06,630
One.

3022
02:50:06,730 --> 02:50:07,090
Two.

3023
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:09,030
That I'll sink so much money into something.

3024
02:50:09,030 --> 02:50:11,430
And then it'll be gone one day.

3025
02:50:11,470 --> 02:50:12,290
I know.

3026
02:50:12,610 --> 02:50:12,930
I know.

3027
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,490
Two.

3028
02:50:16,490 --> 02:50:17,250
Dang it.

3029
02:50:17,390 --> 02:50:18,270
Oh my god.

3030
02:50:18,470 --> 02:50:20,050
You guys, I don't think this is...

3031
02:50:20,050 --> 02:50:20,770
Two.

3032
02:50:23,110 --> 02:50:23,610
One.

3033
02:50:23,730 --> 02:50:24,230
Two.

3034
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:25,230
Dang it.

3035
02:50:25,330 --> 02:50:25,610
Okay.

3036
02:50:28,150 --> 02:50:29,910
Some vtubers don't have your restraint.

3037
02:50:30,150 --> 02:50:32,570
It's because... I'll be honest.

3038
02:50:32,810 --> 02:50:33,170
Okay.

3039
02:50:33,810 --> 02:50:35,570
It's because I come from...

3040
02:50:37,210 --> 02:50:38,590
A life... Okay.

3041
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:40,950
I'm gonna say this in the nicest way possible.

3042
02:50:41,350 --> 02:50:45,250
A lot of vtubers are young and don't know struggle.

3043
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:51,010
And they don't...

3044
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:53,130
They don't know what it's like.

3045
02:50:53,450 --> 02:50:54,170
You know, they...

3046
02:50:54,170 --> 02:50:55,570
They are still at home.

3047
02:50:56,090 --> 02:50:58,370
And so they are like...

3048
02:51:00,630 --> 02:51:01,650
They're like, yeah.

3049
02:51:03,550 --> 02:51:05,890
I can spend all my money on gacha.

3050
02:51:08,330 --> 02:51:10,570
But I was living paycheck to paycheck.

3051
02:51:14,030 --> 02:51:15,390
And so I have...

3052
02:51:15,390 --> 02:51:16,990
I have money discipline.

3053
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:30,610
So that's why.

3054
02:51:31,310 --> 02:51:32,530
Didn't I get up to...

3055
02:51:32,530 --> 02:51:34,570
12 I think was my highest, right?

3056
02:51:34,690 --> 02:51:34,990
12.

3057
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:39,890
Or I got up to 20 or something crazy.

3058
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:42,870
People who spend lots on gacha are foolish.

3059
02:51:43,370 --> 02:51:44,910
Pay no attention to the costume gacha.

3060
02:51:44,930 --> 02:51:47,590
For all the gyaru on my account.

3061
02:51:48,230 --> 02:51:49,190
Oh yeah, it was 20.

3062
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:50,710
You guys, I'm regressing.

3063
02:51:50,850 --> 02:51:52,130
Okay, locking in.

3064
02:51:52,210 --> 02:51:52,730
I'm locking in.

3065
02:51:53,550 --> 02:51:55,550
1, 2.

3066
02:51:59,590 --> 02:52:00,730
1, 2.

3067
02:52:02,130 --> 02:52:03,070
Still a foul.

3068
02:52:04,670 --> 02:52:05,670
Singing cardio.

3069
02:52:06,090 --> 02:52:06,450
2.

3070
02:52:07,010 --> 02:52:08,390
Plus singing straw.

3071
02:52:09,050 --> 02:52:10,190
Macho musical mate.

3072
02:52:10,310 --> 02:52:11,370
How is that also foul?

3073
02:52:11,850 --> 02:52:12,410
2.

3074
02:52:12,630 --> 02:52:13,930
Oh my god, no.

3075
02:52:13,930 --> 02:52:14,490
Please.

3076
02:52:16,390 --> 02:52:17,850
1, 2.

3077
02:52:20,110 --> 02:52:21,270
1, 2.

3078
02:52:23,270 --> 02:52:24,030
1, 2.

3079
02:52:24,350 --> 02:52:25,250
Locking in.

3080
02:52:25,310 --> 02:52:25,810
I'm locking in.

3081
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:26,830
I'm locking in.

3082
02:52:27,450 --> 02:52:28,670
1, 2.

3083
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:35,880
1, 2.

3084
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:38,940
1, 2.

3085
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,260
1, 2.

3086
02:52:43,640 --> 02:52:45,260
1, 2.

3087
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:45,340
2.

3088
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:48,700
1, 2.

3089
02:53:28,510 --> 02:53:29,090
2.

3090
02:53:29,090 --> 02:53:30,470
See to ride in.

3091
02:53:32,190 --> 02:53:32,770
See...

3092
02:53:32,770 --> 02:53:34,150
I don't know what those mean.

3093
02:53:34,450 --> 02:53:35,370
Are you playing bingo?

3094
02:53:36,030 --> 02:53:37,290
What the hell does that mean?

3095
02:53:40,490 --> 02:53:43,270
Why are you playing bingo with your gacha characters?

3096
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:53,840
It's Genshin.

3097
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:56,300
You guys...

3098
02:53:57,940 --> 02:54:00,800
I don't know why I just can't get any...

3099
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:02,880
into a Hoyoverse game.

3100
02:54:04,480 --> 02:54:06,160
They'll have the cutest designs.

3101
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:08,620
They'll appeal to me in every possible way.

3102
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:09,460
And I'll be like...

3103
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:11,260
But like...

3104
02:54:11,260 --> 02:54:12,660
I just can't get into mihoyo.

3105
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:18,460
I'll be like...

3106
02:54:18,460 --> 02:54:19,940
Oh my god, the cutest character ever.

3107
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:25,000
I even had fun playing Genshin when I played it.

3108
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,420
The two times I played it.

3109
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:26,800
See?

3110
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:28,640
Get called, boss.

3111
02:54:29,640 --> 02:54:30,360
See to...

3112
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:34,800
What if I... Oh my god.

3113
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:36,140
Can I get the ball backwards?

3114
02:54:37,780 --> 02:54:38,140
How?

3115
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:38,720
Oh my gosh.

3116
02:54:38,780 --> 02:54:39,600
I'm not even...

3117
02:54:41,380 --> 02:54:42,780
I'm trying to hit the ball backwards.

3118
02:54:51,450 --> 02:54:52,430
VTubers are my gacha.

3119
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:53,650
Minto is my SSR.

3120
02:54:53,930 --> 02:54:55,150
Guyself can't wail anymore.

3121
02:55:01,320 --> 02:55:02,840
That was a bad game, you guys.

3122
02:55:04,980 --> 02:55:06,880
Basically the same for the most part, are they?

3123
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:08,280
One, two!

3124
02:55:08,800 --> 02:55:09,740
Oh my god.

3125
02:55:10,480 --> 02:55:11,560
One, two!

3126
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:14,740
One, two!

3127
02:55:15,720 --> 02:55:16,280
Okay.

3128
02:55:16,540 --> 02:55:17,100
Alright.

3129
02:55:18,420 --> 02:55:18,980
Okay.

3130
02:55:19,360 --> 02:55:19,920
Okay.

3131
02:55:21,240 --> 02:55:22,240
One, two!

3132
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:23,980
Not a foul.

3133
02:55:24,160 --> 02:55:24,440
Foul!

3134
02:55:26,800 --> 02:55:28,040
One, two!

3135
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:29,520
Not a foul.

3136
02:55:29,800 --> 02:55:30,200
Foul!

3137
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:31,080
Foul!

3138
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:34,020
One, two!

3139
02:55:36,260 --> 02:55:37,400
One, two!

3140
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:44,740
One, two!

3141
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:45,620
One, two!

3142
02:55:45,620 --> 02:55:47,580
No yelling.

3143
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:48,040
Thank you.

3144
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:49,060
Thank you.

3145
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:51,380
One, blue!

3146
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:56,900
One, blue!

3147
02:55:58,240 --> 02:55:59,160
Oh, please.

3148
02:55:59,580 --> 02:56:01,420
The story is legit good.

3149
02:56:01,560 --> 02:56:02,920
It's actually so good.

3150
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:04,320
Two!

3151
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:04,400
Two!

3152
02:56:10,620 --> 02:56:11,720
One, two!

3153
02:56:13,860 --> 02:56:15,040
One, two!

3154
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:23,780
I mean, maybe after this, I might add some upgrades.

3155
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:29,280
After this, I might add some upgrades.

3156
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:30,160
It's fun gacha.

3157
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:32,140
I mean, I don't doubt it.

3158
02:56:32,180 --> 02:56:32,860
I just can't.

3159
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:33,720
I don't know.

3160
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:36,300
One, two!

3161
02:56:36,300 --> 02:56:38,040
Oh, please!

3162
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:42,740
Yes!

3163
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:49,310
Yes!

3164
02:56:52,970 --> 02:56:53,630
Two!

3165
02:56:55,470 --> 02:56:56,630
One, two!

3166
02:56:57,310 --> 02:56:57,790
One, two!

3167
02:56:58,770 --> 02:57:01,290
Most people are fully upgraded or near fully upgraded.

3168
02:57:01,770 --> 02:57:02,830
One, two!

3169
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:05,070
It's just a skill issue, though.

3170
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:08,330
Because I didn't do any more upgrades.

3171
02:57:08,490 --> 02:57:11,190
Because I didn't do any more upgrades.

3172
02:57:11,190 --> 02:57:12,510
And I got the 22!

3173
02:57:13,150 --> 02:57:13,850
Two!

3174
02:57:14,270 --> 02:57:15,810
It's just a skill issue.

3175
02:57:20,350 --> 02:57:21,470
One, two!

3176
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:27,270
I did well.

3177
02:57:28,110 --> 02:57:28,810
Two!

3178
02:57:30,230 --> 02:57:31,410
I did.

3179
02:57:32,370 --> 02:57:34,970
Oh, I just realized this is not beatable anymore.

3180
02:57:35,470 --> 02:57:36,050
Oh, man.

3181
02:57:42,350 --> 02:57:43,470
One, two!

3182
02:57:43,810 --> 02:57:44,490
One,

3183
02:57:48,370 --> 02:57:48,810
two!

3184
02:57:49,250 --> 02:57:50,470
One, two!

3185
02:57:50,470 --> 02:57:51,190
That wasn't close enough.

3186
02:57:51,350 --> 02:57:52,250
One, two!

3187
02:57:58,580 --> 02:57:59,940
One, two!

3188
02:58:00,520 --> 02:58:01,180
One, two!

3189
02:58:01,180 --> 02:58:01,920
Look at this, though.

3190
02:58:01,940 --> 02:58:02,720
We're doing so well.

3191
02:58:05,780 --> 02:58:07,260
One, two!

3192
02:58:13,230 --> 02:58:14,710
One, two!

3193
02:58:15,190 --> 02:58:15,210
One, two!

3194
02:58:15,610 --> 02:58:16,350
Foul.

3195
02:58:17,670 --> 02:58:18,590
One to foul.

3196
02:58:20,470 --> 02:58:21,190
Please.

3197
02:58:21,390 --> 02:58:21,870
Tigger.

3198
02:58:22,690 --> 02:58:23,410
Tigger!

3199
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:30,400
I'm gonna drink more of my tea.

3200
02:58:35,740 --> 02:58:37,780
I'm gonna drink

3201
02:58:40,970 --> 02:58:40,970
more of my tea.

3202
02:58:41,290 --> 02:58:42,910
And... game!

3203
02:58:45,670 --> 02:58:46,390
And...

3204
02:58:46,390 --> 02:58:46,390
game!

3205
02:58:46,390 --> 02:58:46,650
Burp?

3206
02:58:46,790 --> 02:58:48,050
I don't know how to burp.

3207
02:58:48,070 --> 02:58:51,030
Actually, I'm physically incapable of burping.

3208
02:58:51,030 --> 02:58:51,190
And...

3209
02:58:52,290 --> 02:58:53,290
Isn't that kind of crazy?

3210
02:58:54,210 --> 02:58:55,690
It's like I have a...

3211
02:58:55,690 --> 02:58:57,010
It's like... I don't know.

3212
02:58:57,050 --> 02:58:57,910
I forgot what it's called.

3213
02:58:59,470 --> 02:58:59,910
But...

3214
02:59:00,650 --> 02:59:01,090
Um...

3215
02:59:02,850 --> 02:59:04,250
Yeah, I don't...

3216
02:59:05,530 --> 02:59:05,970
I...

3217
02:59:05,970 --> 02:59:08,590
I forgot what it's called.

3218
02:59:12,710 --> 02:59:13,990
Same as that other Super Chat.

3219
02:59:14,070 --> 02:59:16,690
Donating to Beat Tubers made me stop wailing and move again.

3220
02:59:16,910 --> 02:59:20,010
At least this way my money goes to helping an actual person.

3221
02:59:20,310 --> 02:59:21,010
At least this way my money goes to helping an actual person.

3222
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:21,230
I...

3223
02:59:21,950 --> 02:59:22,510
I...

3224
02:59:26,230 --> 02:59:27,550
Idols don't burp.

3225
02:59:27,650 --> 02:59:27,890
Idols don't burp.

3226
02:59:28,050 --> 02:59:29,410
I don't think that's the case.

3227
02:59:36,130 --> 02:59:36,690
Fifteen.

3228
02:59:38,850 --> 02:59:39,410
Fifteen.

3229
02:59:41,990 --> 02:59:42,550
Fifteen.

3230
02:59:42,550 --> 02:59:42,890
Fifteen.

3231
02:59:42,890 --> 02:59:42,950
Okay.

3232
02:59:43,170 --> 02:59:45,750
Oh, we can't even level anything else up anymore.

3233
02:59:46,030 --> 02:59:46,310
Oh, we can't even level anything else up anymore.

3234
02:59:47,850 --> 02:59:48,410
Two!

3235
02:59:53,320 --> 02:59:53,640
Oh.

3236
02:59:53,640 --> 02:59:54,320
Oh my god.

3237
02:59:54,460 --> 02:59:54,880
Okay.

3238
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:55,680
One.

3239
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:56,160
Two.

3240
03:00:02,700 --> 03:00:03,180
One.

3241
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:03,700
Two.

3242
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:05,000
One.

3243
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Two.

3244
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:05,960
I forgot what it's called.

3245
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:06,700
I'll have to look it up.

3246
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:08,280
Because I was just like, what the hell?

3247
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:09,920
One.

3248
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:10,260
Two.

3249
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:13,200
Can't burp and he's...

3250
03:00:13,200 --> 03:00:15,640
Isn't supposed to have spicy food or carbonated drinks.

3251
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:16,020
Isn't supposed to have spicy food or carbonated drinks.

3252
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:16,520
That's me.

3253
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:17,380
One.

3254
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:17,740
Two.

3255
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:18,360
One.

3256
03:00:20,700 --> 03:00:21,120
Two.

3257
03:00:21,700 --> 03:00:22,180
One.

3258
03:00:23,060 --> 03:00:23,540
Two.

3259
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:23,900
One.

3260
03:00:23,960 --> 03:00:24,360
Two.

3261
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:25,020
One.

3262
03:00:25,020 --> 03:00:25,020
Two.

3263
03:00:25,640 --> 03:00:26,120
One.

3264
03:00:29,320 --> 03:00:29,800
Two.

3265
03:00:29,800 --> 03:00:30,860
One.

3266
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:31,320
Two.

3267
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:32,660
You gotcha for one.

3268
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:32,940
Two.

3269
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:34,540
One.

3270
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:34,980
Two.

3271
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:37,760
One.

3272
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:38,400
Two.

3273
03:00:38,760 --> 03:00:39,320
One.

3274
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:41,580
Two.

3275
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:44,400
One.

3276
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:44,880
Two.

3277
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:46,820
Come on.

3278
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:50,360
One.

3279
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:50,740
Two.

3280
03:00:51,820 --> 03:00:53,180
But it's funny because...

3281
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:57,100
I can't burp and it just makes like a funny noise in my throat.

3282
03:00:57,320 --> 03:00:57,900
I can't burp and it just makes like a funny noise in my throat.

3283
03:00:57,900 --> 03:00:57,900
One.

3284
03:00:57,900 --> 03:00:58,240
Two.

3285
03:00:58,580 --> 03:00:58,980
One.

3286
03:00:58,980 --> 03:00:58,980
Two.

3287
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:04,980
One.

3288
03:01:05,240 --> 03:01:05,540
Two.

3289
03:01:08,040 --> 03:01:08,480
One.

3290
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:08,920
Two.

3291
03:01:13,610 --> 03:01:14,050
One.

3292
03:01:14,430 --> 03:01:14,870
Two.

3293
03:01:15,010 --> 03:01:15,110
One.

3294
03:01:15,110 --> 03:01:15,110
Two.

3295
03:01:15,110 --> 03:01:17,310
I'm not saying that girls can't burp, you dummies.

3296
03:01:18,970 --> 03:01:20,810
I'm not saying girls don't burp.

3297
03:01:20,830 --> 03:01:20,930
I'm not saying girls don't burp.

3298
03:01:20,930 --> 03:01:21,890
It's because I'm a girl.

3299
03:01:24,970 --> 03:01:25,830
It's like a thing.

3300
03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:26,930
I don't know what it's called though.

3301
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:27,770
I don't remember.

3302
03:01:28,050 --> 03:01:28,470
Two.

3303
03:01:28,470 --> 03:01:28,610
Two.

3304
03:01:29,550 --> 03:01:31,350
Guys, I'm already...

3305
03:01:31,350 --> 03:01:33,210
Too many fouls.

3306
03:01:39,540 --> 03:01:42,240
How am I getting so many fouls?

3307
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:43,300
No!

3308
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:45,600
Why?

3309
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:47,860
So many fouls in a row.

3310
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:49,320
Why?

3311
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:49,660
Why?

3312
03:01:49,700 --> 03:01:50,060
Why?

3313
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:52,320
Why?

3314
03:01:52,320 --> 03:01:52,880
Why?

3315
03:01:53,240 --> 03:01:53,440
Why?

3316
03:01:53,880 --> 03:01:53,880
Why?

3317
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:54,560
Why?

3318
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:12,250
Why?

3319
03:02:12,650 --> 03:02:13,310
Why?

3320
03:02:13,310 --> 03:02:13,730
Why?

3321
03:02:17,410 --> 03:02:18,010
So

3322
03:02:23,510 --> 03:02:26,030
many fouls...

3323
03:02:26,030 --> 03:02:27,950
How many ladies are among the wisps?

3324
03:02:28,490 --> 03:02:29,750
Ladies rise up.

3325
03:02:31,450 --> 03:02:33,230
Ladies, where are you at?

3326
03:02:36,990 --> 03:02:39,370
After this one, I'm locking in.

3327
03:02:39,490 --> 03:02:42,090
After this one, no more talks of farts and burping.

3328
03:02:42,270 --> 03:02:43,510
No more talks of...

3329
03:02:43,510 --> 03:02:44,850
What else did we talk about?

3330
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:50,340
Nothing else!

3331
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:51,620
Only baseball!

3332
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:52,640
Only baseball!

3333
03:02:55,060 --> 03:02:56,060
Only baseball!

3334
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:57,000
Only baseball!

3335
03:02:58,740 --> 03:03:00,460
Yeah, no more talks of gotcha!

3336
03:03:04,030 --> 03:03:06,770
No more talks of even ladies.

3337
03:03:07,450 --> 03:03:09,530
No more ladies talk.

3338
03:03:11,270 --> 03:03:12,270
After this one.

3339
03:03:15,290 --> 03:03:20,320
I get to 22 on like the second try.

3340
03:03:21,100 --> 03:03:23,220
I think I got too comfortable, you know?

3341
03:03:23,400 --> 03:03:25,520
I'm not focusing enough.

3342
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:27,100
Okay, here we go.

3343
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:31,060
Last one.

3344
03:03:31,080 --> 03:03:31,700
Okay.

3345
03:03:32,830 --> 03:03:33,140
Okay.

3346
03:03:34,320 --> 03:03:34,940
Alright.

3347
03:03:35,780 --> 03:03:36,400
Alright.

3348
03:03:37,620 --> 03:03:38,240
Okay.

3349
03:03:38,820 --> 03:03:39,440
Baseball.

3350
03:03:39,560 --> 03:03:40,180
Baseball.

3351
03:03:40,260 --> 03:03:40,880
Baseball.

3352
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:41,480
Baseball.

3353
03:03:41,640 --> 03:03:42,800
I'm locking in.

3354
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:44,160
I'm locking in on Tigger.

3355
03:03:47,540 --> 03:03:48,160
Nice!

3356
03:03:53,770 --> 03:03:54,390
One.

3357
03:03:54,430 --> 03:03:55,030
Two.

3358
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:58,850
Okay.

3359
03:03:58,950 --> 03:03:59,750
Locking in.

3360
03:04:00,290 --> 03:04:03,550
That was a strike.

3361
03:04:03,830 --> 03:04:06,310
Does not work.

3362
03:04:06,430 --> 03:04:06,950
That's a foul.

3363
03:04:07,270 --> 03:04:08,570
There you go.

3364
03:04:09,790 --> 03:04:11,330
One, Two.

3365
03:04:13,570 --> 03:04:14,870
One, Two.

3366
03:04:18,170 --> 03:04:19,250
One, Two.

3367
03:04:19,250 --> 03:04:19,530
176?

3368
03:04:21,150 --> 03:04:22,570
One, Two.

3369
03:04:26,210 --> 03:04:26,970
176?

3370
03:04:27,410 --> 03:04:27,610
173.

3371
03:04:28,870 --> 03:04:30,130
One, Two.

3372
03:04:30,350 --> 03:04:30,890
Dang it.

3373
03:04:32,170 --> 03:04:33,450
One, Two.

3374
03:04:35,710 --> 03:04:36,350
One, two!

3375
03:04:36,350 --> 03:04:36,630
One, two!

3376
03:04:40,290 --> 03:04:44,030
One, two!

3377
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:48,510
Alright, alright, alright!

3378
03:04:50,810 --> 03:04:51,750
One, two!

3379
03:04:53,390 --> 03:04:54,670
The one, two works!

3380
03:04:56,610 --> 03:04:57,530
One, two!

3381
03:04:57,550 --> 03:04:57,970
One, two!

3382
03:04:58,370 --> 03:04:59,410
One, two!

3383
03:05:03,450 --> 03:05:04,630
I'm getting sweaty, you guys.

3384
03:05:04,670 --> 03:05:05,190
I'm getting sweaty.

3385
03:05:05,990 --> 03:05:06,810
One, two!

3386
03:05:07,230 --> 03:05:08,250
I'm getting sweaty!

3387
03:05:08,470 --> 03:05:09,050
I'm getting sweaty!

3388
03:05:13,470 --> 03:05:14,430
One, two!

3389
03:05:20,570 --> 03:05:21,570
One, two!

3390
03:05:22,150 --> 03:05:22,530
Dang it!

3391
03:05:22,690 --> 03:05:23,390
It's a foul.

3392
03:05:26,210 --> 03:05:27,190
One, two!

3393
03:05:30,860 --> 03:05:31,620
It's a foul.

3394
03:05:35,780 --> 03:05:36,080
One, two!

3395
03:05:36,980 --> 03:05:39,180
Don't they allow like some fouls though?

3396
03:05:39,260 --> 03:05:41,600
You have like two fouls before it's a strikeout or something.

3397
03:05:42,820 --> 03:05:43,540
One, two!

3398
03:05:43,780 --> 03:05:44,980
Dang it, I was too far over.

3399
03:05:46,140 --> 03:05:46,860
One, two!

3400
03:05:47,080 --> 03:05:48,040
Dang it, dang it, dang it.

3401
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:50,200
One, two!

3402
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:51,240
No, no, no!

3403
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:53,360
One, two!

3404
03:05:58,470 --> 03:05:59,170
One, two!

3405
03:06:00,570 --> 03:06:01,750
Is this still winnable?

3406
03:06:05,770 --> 03:06:06,750
One, two!

3407
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:08,710
Nope, not anymore.

3408
03:06:11,070 --> 03:06:11,830
It's over.

3409
03:06:27,650 --> 03:06:28,750
Oh man.

3410
03:06:41,740 --> 03:06:42,380
Guys...

3411
03:06:43,400 --> 03:06:46,040
My goal is to just make it past Tigger.

3412
03:06:46,400 --> 03:06:46,960
My goal is to just make it past Tigger.

3413
03:06:46,960 --> 03:06:47,420
I almost said Twitter.

3414
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:50,260
I almost said Twitter.

3415
03:06:51,220 --> 03:06:54,060
I just wanna make it past Tigger at this point.

3416
03:06:54,640 --> 03:06:58,100
I just wanna make it past Tigger at this point.

3417
03:06:58,100 --> 03:06:58,740
One, two!

3418
03:06:59,100 --> 03:06:59,860
Oh no.

3419
03:07:00,860 --> 03:07:01,800
One, two!

3420
03:07:09,290 --> 03:07:12,330
I don't think we'll be able to beat Christopher Robin.

3421
03:07:13,090 --> 03:07:17,030
I don't think today we'll be able to beat Christopher Robin.

3422
03:07:18,570 --> 03:07:19,290
Two!

3423
03:07:20,190 --> 03:07:22,590
Did Pikamee beat Christopher Robin?

3424
03:07:23,030 --> 03:07:23,990
Can't remember.

3425
03:07:39,210 --> 03:07:40,130
She did?

3426
03:07:42,330 --> 03:07:43,650
Oh she Rage Quit.

3427
03:07:43,770 --> 03:07:44,270
What?

3428
03:07:48,610 --> 03:07:50,970
She immediately walked away from Chris.

3429
03:07:57,440 --> 03:07:58,740
She's so real for that.

3430
03:08:01,480 --> 03:08:04,200
Maybe one day we'll have like a Chris...

3431
03:08:07,420 --> 03:08:08,540
Shit you.

3432
03:08:10,280 --> 03:08:11,740
We can have a Chris challenge.

3433
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:20,880
One, two!

3434
03:08:21,700 --> 03:08:24,140
Is that a super chat to backseat me?

3435
03:08:27,440 --> 03:08:28,540
One, two!

3436
03:08:28,820 --> 03:08:29,280
Dang it.

3437
03:08:30,940 --> 03:08:31,780
One, two!

3438
03:08:35,910 --> 03:08:38,130
I used the upgrade system a little bit, yeah.

3439
03:08:38,430 --> 03:08:39,270
One, two!

3440
03:08:39,550 --> 03:08:41,790
But it doesn't... only the speed helps.

3441
03:08:45,830 --> 03:08:46,850
One, two!

3442
03:08:47,290 --> 03:08:47,970
Oh dang it.

3443
03:08:48,190 --> 03:08:48,750
Foul.

3444
03:08:51,070 --> 03:08:51,990
One, two!

3445
03:08:52,590 --> 03:08:53,570
Please not be a foul.

3446
03:09:04,850 --> 03:09:05,510
One, two!

3447
03:09:05,810 --> 03:09:06,890
Oh, it's a movie reference.

3448
03:09:10,030 --> 03:09:10,870
One, two!

3449
03:09:11,050 --> 03:09:11,650
Oh shoot.

3450
03:09:11,810 --> 03:09:12,990
Okay, I need to stop looking at chat.

3451
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:14,190
One, two!

3452
03:09:14,790 --> 03:09:16,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3453
03:09:16,170 --> 03:09:16,330
Okay.

3454
03:09:16,830 --> 03:09:17,550
One, two!

3455
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:18,690
Oh, okay.

3456
03:09:18,770 --> 03:09:19,470
It's over you guys.

3457
03:09:19,570 --> 03:09:19,930
It's over.

3458
03:09:22,050 --> 03:09:22,790
It's so over.

3459
03:09:22,850 --> 03:09:24,070
I got distracted by chat.

3460
03:09:24,510 --> 03:09:26,230
I got distracted by closed chat.

3461
03:09:26,410 --> 03:09:27,530
I might actually have to.

3462
03:09:27,770 --> 03:09:28,510
One, two!

3463
03:09:28,670 --> 03:09:29,730
And then I'll just talk to myself.

3464
03:09:30,470 --> 03:09:31,830
I'll pretend that nobody's here.

3465
03:09:32,310 --> 03:09:36,250
I'll pretend it's just me, myself, and I.

3466
03:09:36,470 --> 03:09:37,210
I'm not even streaming.

3467
03:09:37,470 --> 03:09:39,370
Me, myself, and I.

3468
03:09:39,750 --> 03:09:40,610
Okay, I'm closing chat.

3469
03:09:40,870 --> 03:09:41,970
Oops, I just made chat bigger.

3470
03:09:48,270 --> 03:09:50,070
Me, myself, and the game.

3471
03:09:51,070 --> 03:09:52,690
I can't see anything.

3472
03:09:53,050 --> 03:09:55,410
Wow, if that had gone in the water, would that have been a foul?

3473
03:09:56,470 --> 03:09:57,430
Two... nope.

3474
03:09:57,570 --> 03:09:59,490
Okay, now the game is really ruined.

3475
03:09:59,670 --> 03:10:01,450
The run is really ruined, but...

3476
03:10:03,110 --> 03:10:03,750
It's okay.

3477
03:10:04,350 --> 03:10:06,950
I'm just playing on my own time.

3478
03:10:08,410 --> 03:10:09,310
To nobody.

3479
03:10:10,070 --> 03:10:10,850
Nobody's watching.

3480
03:10:11,990 --> 03:10:13,790
Nobody's paying attention to me.

3481
03:10:15,890 --> 03:10:18,070
If I'm bad, there's no one to backseat me.

3482
03:10:18,210 --> 03:10:22,270
There's no one to say, You're such a bad player at this game.

3483
03:10:22,830 --> 03:10:25,070
You're so terrible at the game.

3484
03:10:25,470 --> 03:10:27,070
You're the worst at the game.

3485
03:10:47,790 --> 03:10:50,590
Okay, I've brought you guys back.

3486
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:54,710
Hit the balls instead of missing them.

3487
03:11:05,380 --> 03:11:07,680
Okay, now I'm looking at you guys.

3488
03:11:10,660 --> 03:11:12,420
But not this time.

3489
03:11:14,100 --> 03:11:15,620
We're here for Tigger.

3490
03:11:16,540 --> 03:11:17,620
One, two!

3491
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:19,000
Foul.

3492
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:21,800
One, two, foul.

3493
03:11:22,580 --> 03:11:23,620
One, two!

3494
03:11:25,640 --> 03:11:26,880
One, two!

3495
03:11:28,380 --> 03:11:29,920
Doesn't he start with 40?

3496
03:11:30,060 --> 03:11:31,400
Why are we already at 37?

3497
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:34,460
One, two!

3498
03:11:34,840 --> 03:11:35,520
Foul.

3499
03:11:38,800 --> 03:11:39,800
One, two!

3500
03:11:43,440 --> 03:11:43,780
180!

3501
03:11:44,540 --> 03:11:45,800
Holy moly.

3502
03:11:46,480 --> 03:11:47,460
One, two!

3503
03:11:47,560 --> 03:11:49,020
Someone signed me up...

3504
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:51,220
for the major leagues.

3505
03:11:51,720 --> 03:11:53,000
One, two!

3506
03:11:59,290 --> 03:12:00,000
One, two!

3507
03:12:01,660 --> 03:12:04,020
You guys, the fouls!

3508
03:12:04,020 --> 03:12:05,000
The fouls!

3509
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:06,060
Fuck you, Tigger!

3510
03:12:09,190 --> 03:12:09,560
Tigger?

3511
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:17,020
I don't know how you do this.

3512
03:12:17,260 --> 03:12:18,580
I don't know what...

3513
03:12:18,580 --> 03:12:20,960
Everybody sold their souls...

3514
03:12:20,960 --> 03:12:22,480
to Christopher Robin.

3515
03:12:23,300 --> 03:12:24,400
One, two!

3516
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:26,880
Everybody sold their souls...

3517
03:12:26,880 --> 03:12:27,880
to Christopher Robin.

3518
03:12:30,940 --> 03:12:31,900
One, two!

3519
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:35,340
One, two!

3520
03:12:36,680 --> 03:12:37,680
Fuck you, Tigger.

3521
03:12:38,100 --> 03:12:38,760
Fuck you.

3522
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:39,920
I can't even...

3523
03:12:39,920 --> 03:12:40,980
Oh, actually, this is...

3524
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:42,900
One, two!

3525
03:12:43,060 --> 03:12:43,280
It's...

3526
03:12:43,280 --> 03:12:43,620
Nope.

3527
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:44,980
This is not beatable anymore.

3528
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:48,040
It's not beatable anymore.

3529
03:12:48,320 --> 03:12:49,180
You know, Tigger...

3530
03:12:49,180 --> 03:12:49,960
I hope you...

3531
03:12:49,960 --> 03:12:51,440
I hope you break your fucking tail.

3532
03:12:51,500 --> 03:12:52,100
I hope you never...

3533
03:12:52,100 --> 03:12:53,960
I hope you never jump on that tail ever again.

3534
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,320
Look at him with his hands behind his back.

3535
03:12:55,340 --> 03:12:57,260
He's like, which hand am I gonna throw it from?

3536
03:12:58,040 --> 03:12:58,840
Which side?

3537
03:12:59,480 --> 03:13:00,760
It's the same side always.

3538
03:13:00,820 --> 03:13:02,060
But which way is it gonna go?

3539
03:13:02,620 --> 03:13:04,680
It's just gonna disappear into the ether...

3540
03:13:04,680 --> 03:13:06,600
because I'm a fucking wizard.

3541
03:13:12,050 --> 03:13:13,090
I'm gonna go to Disney.

3542
03:13:13,490 --> 03:13:14,290
And I'm gonna...

3543
03:13:14,290 --> 03:13:15,510
I'm gonna rip you up.

3544
03:13:17,470 --> 03:13:19,130
I'm gonna rip you a real new one.

3545
03:13:19,170 --> 03:13:20,590
That fursuit is gonna have...

3546
03:13:20,590 --> 03:13:22,470
It's gonna have five holes in it...

3547
03:13:22,470 --> 03:13:23,690
once I'm done with you.

3548
03:13:23,690 --> 03:13:23,690
One for you.

3549
03:13:25,410 --> 03:13:26,490
One for the body.

3550
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:32,260
And one for everywhere else.

3551
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:38,280
Come here, Tigger.

3552
03:13:39,860 --> 03:13:41,780
Oh, maybe I just need to get mad at him.

3553
03:13:44,060 --> 03:13:45,260
They will sue me.

3554
03:13:45,800 --> 03:13:47,540
Never let me back into your parks again.

3555
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:50,380
I never want to, but I never want to see Tigger's face again.

3556
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:57,660
Actually, someone invited me to Tokyo Disney.

3557
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:00,740
While I'm in Japan this time.

3558
03:14:01,100 --> 03:14:03,880
And I'm like... I'm like...

3559
03:14:04,820 --> 03:14:06,740
What if... Maybe I shouldn't go.

3560
03:14:20,170 --> 03:14:21,250
Indiana Jones.

3561
03:14:22,550 --> 03:14:23,510
You're right.

3562
03:14:23,850 --> 03:14:25,670
I just got to think of Indy.

3563
03:14:29,150 --> 03:14:30,510
What do...

3564
03:14:32,780 --> 03:14:35,580
I don't think they have the owl at the parks though.

3565
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:37,780
What do...

3566
03:14:37,780 --> 03:14:41,340
What do...

3567
03:14:42,940 --> 03:14:45,740
I don't think they have the owl because nobody loves him.

3568
03:14:48,380 --> 03:14:50,100
Justifiably, nobody loves the owl.

3569
03:14:50,620 --> 03:14:51,100
Good.

3570
03:14:51,260 --> 03:14:52,320
He has no love.

3571
03:14:52,340 --> 03:14:53,220
He has no fans.

3572
03:14:53,700 --> 03:14:55,320
Nobody is a fan of the owl.

3573
03:14:56,900 --> 03:14:58,660
All my friends hate that guy.

3574
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:01,220
Everybody in the world hates the owl.

3575
03:15:12,390 --> 03:15:12,870
Two.

3576
03:15:14,770 --> 03:15:16,010
We don't even know his name.

3577
03:15:16,270 --> 03:15:19,450
Yeah, his parents didn't even love him enough to give him...

3578
03:15:19,450 --> 03:15:20,050
One.

3579
03:15:20,130 --> 03:15:20,470
Two.

3580
03:15:20,470 --> 03:15:21,710
A real name.

3581
03:15:21,910 --> 03:15:23,670
They just named him after his species.

3582
03:15:24,030 --> 03:15:24,690
How embarrassing.

3583
03:15:27,090 --> 03:15:27,730
One.

3584
03:15:27,730 --> 03:15:28,130
Two.

3585
03:15:28,290 --> 03:15:29,530
What if you were named human?

3586
03:15:29,750 --> 03:15:30,630
That's just weird.

3587
03:15:32,350 --> 03:15:32,990
One.

3588
03:15:33,010 --> 03:15:33,350
Two.

3589
03:15:35,490 --> 03:15:36,130
One.

3590
03:15:36,230 --> 03:15:36,650
Two.

3591
03:15:38,730 --> 03:15:39,370
One.

3592
03:15:39,470 --> 03:15:39,710
Two.

3593
03:15:43,880 --> 03:15:44,920
Okay, maid.

3594
03:15:45,060 --> 03:15:46,140
That's not my name.

3595
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:47,080
Two.

3596
03:15:50,200 --> 03:15:51,860
You ruined my...

3597
03:15:51,860 --> 03:15:53,260
You ruined my...

3598
03:15:53,260 --> 03:15:54,040
Thing.

3599
03:15:54,540 --> 03:15:55,140
One.

3600
03:15:55,240 --> 03:15:55,520
Two.

3601
03:15:57,040 --> 03:15:58,340
You ruined my swing.

3602
03:16:02,100 --> 03:16:02,700
One.

3603
03:16:02,700 --> 03:16:03,000
Two.

3604
03:16:05,160 --> 03:16:05,760
One.

3605
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:06,320
Two.

3606
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:13,040
One.

3607
03:16:13,140 --> 03:16:13,440
Two.

3608
03:16:17,370 --> 03:16:18,450
It's a title.

3609
03:16:18,550 --> 03:16:19,390
The maid...

3610
03:16:20,850 --> 03:16:23,090
The maid part is a title.

3611
03:16:23,190 --> 03:16:26,670
Just like Mr. Mrs. It's a title.

3612
03:16:27,570 --> 03:16:28,170
One.

3613
03:16:28,170 --> 03:16:28,570
Two.

3614
03:16:28,570 --> 03:16:29,230
Fuck.

3615
03:16:29,490 --> 03:16:30,290
Fuck you.

3616
03:16:30,450 --> 03:16:31,130
Fuck you.

3617
03:16:31,890 --> 03:16:32,690
Fuck you.

3618
03:16:32,810 --> 03:16:33,290
Fuck you.

3619
03:16:33,310 --> 03:16:33,590
Fuck you.

3620
03:16:39,790 --> 03:16:40,310
One.

3621
03:16:40,550 --> 03:16:40,890
Two.

3622
03:16:50,620 --> 03:16:51,140
One.

3623
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:51,680
Two.

3624
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:54,360
One.

3625
03:16:54,480 --> 03:16:54,960
Two.

3626
03:17:11,010 --> 03:17:11,530
Please.

3627
03:17:12,470 --> 03:17:12,990
One.

3628
03:17:13,030 --> 03:17:13,430
Two.

3629
03:17:41,350 --> 03:17:42,630
I'm drinking more tea.

3630
03:17:56,010 --> 03:17:57,250
Is it worth the wait?

3631
03:17:57,410 --> 03:17:57,930
Yeah.

3632
03:17:57,930 --> 03:17:58,110
Yeah.

3633
03:18:00,470 --> 03:18:00,970
Yeah.

3634
03:18:03,270 --> 03:18:03,770
Yeah.

3635
03:18:03,790 --> 03:18:05,150
It was so worth the wait.

3636
03:18:06,430 --> 03:18:06,930
Yeah.

3637
03:18:09,290 --> 03:18:11,690
Yeah, it was so worth the wait.

3638
03:18:13,530 --> 03:18:15,870
It was so worth the wait.

3639
03:18:16,350 --> 03:18:17,810
You're my kamiyoshi.

3640
03:18:19,770 --> 03:18:22,390
I think as a kid yoir was my favorite, too.

3641
03:18:24,490 --> 03:18:25,350
Related to him.

3642
03:18:25,490 --> 03:18:25,850
But...

3643
03:18:25,850 --> 03:18:28,850
It's kind of sad as a kid to relate to Eeyore, maybe.

3644
03:18:30,970 --> 03:18:34,210
Oh gosh, we haven't even... you guys, we haven't even gotten close.

3645
03:18:35,070 --> 03:18:36,490
We haven't even gotten close.

3646
03:18:41,370 --> 03:18:42,130
One, two.

3647
03:18:42,430 --> 03:18:43,250
Oh god.

3648
03:18:44,650 --> 03:18:45,450
One, two.

3649
03:19:01,670 --> 03:19:03,150
That's in, that's in, that's in.

3650
03:19:03,250 --> 03:19:03,650
Nice.

3651
03:19:04,110 --> 03:19:05,130
That's in, that's in.

3652
03:19:05,950 --> 03:19:06,430
Okay.

3653
03:19:20,770 --> 03:19:21,410
Nice.

3654
03:19:23,670 --> 03:19:25,490
Wow, that was pretty far.

3655
03:19:31,330 --> 03:19:31,970
Nice.

3656
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:45,520
That's in, that's out.

3657
03:19:49,320 --> 03:19:50,540
Ooh, that's out.

3658
03:19:55,400 --> 03:19:56,480
That's in.

3659
03:20:02,520 --> 03:20:03,880
That's in.

3660
03:20:06,800 --> 03:20:08,280
Dang it.

3661
03:20:13,850 --> 03:20:14,900
That's in.

3662
03:20:21,100 --> 03:20:21,540
Sha!

3663
03:20:28,860 --> 03:20:30,760
I should have gone over a little bit more.

3664
03:20:34,280 --> 03:20:34,720
Nice.

3665
03:20:35,520 --> 03:20:35,960
Okay.

3666
03:20:41,120 --> 03:20:42,000
Dang it.

3667
03:20:49,420 --> 03:20:50,180
That's a foul.

3668
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:56,160
I didn't think I was gonna make that.

3669
03:20:56,340 --> 03:20:57,220
Holy moly.

3670
03:20:57,540 --> 03:20:58,640
How do we do it?

3671
03:20:59,280 --> 03:20:59,860
Mamma mia.

3672
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:02,520
Mamma mia!

3673
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:10,200
Please stay in.

3674
03:21:11,420 --> 03:21:12,100
Yippee!

3675
03:21:14,360 --> 03:21:15,040
Okay.

3676
03:21:15,980 --> 03:21:17,640
Oh shoot, that one was a fast one.

3677
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:20,360
Nice.

3678
03:21:21,260 --> 03:21:23,580
Straight down the kisser, baby.

3679
03:21:27,260 --> 03:21:27,940
Ah!

3680
03:21:28,840 --> 03:21:30,280
I should have gone over.

3681
03:21:30,660 --> 03:21:31,720
Guys, I don't...

3682
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:34,420
Guys, I don't think this is doable.

3683
03:21:36,380 --> 03:21:37,300
This is not...

3684
03:21:37,300 --> 03:21:38,840
It's so strict.

3685
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:40,340
Gosh, you can...

3686
03:21:40,340 --> 03:21:42,340
It doesn't allow for, like, any mistakes.

3687
03:21:43,420 --> 03:21:45,160
It doesn't allow for any mistakes.

3688
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:46,480
At all.

3689
03:21:47,160 --> 03:21:47,920
It's crazy.

3690
03:21:55,770 --> 03:21:57,010
Oh, damn it.

3691
03:21:57,010 --> 03:21:57,310
That was...

3692
03:22:00,290 --> 03:22:00,810
Yeah.

3693
03:22:02,670 --> 03:22:03,950
It's the fouls.

3694
03:22:03,950 --> 03:22:05,390
I would have gotten fouls anyway.

3695
03:22:05,390 --> 03:22:07,110
I would have gotten the fouls.

3696
03:22:24,600 --> 03:22:25,240
Yippee.

3697
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:26,800
Yippee.

3698
03:22:29,940 --> 03:22:31,080
It was personal.

3699
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:35,720
I won't get penalized?

3700
03:22:35,980 --> 03:22:36,680
Isn't it a foul.

3701
03:22:44,940 --> 03:22:46,080
It's like, no...

3702
03:22:46,500 --> 03:22:47,140
No.

3703
03:22:47,140 --> 03:22:48,380
Please stop.

3704
03:22:55,720 --> 03:23:00,080
Oh, I wasn't... I was... my hand was not on the mouse.

3705
03:23:20,750 --> 03:23:21,910
I fucking hate you!

3706
03:23:21,970 --> 03:23:22,670
I fucking hate you!

3707
03:23:22,770 --> 03:23:23,310
I hate you!

3708
03:23:23,350 --> 03:23:23,870
I hate you!

3709
03:23:23,890 --> 03:23:24,870
I hate you so much!

3710
03:23:24,930 --> 03:23:25,890
I hate you so much!

3711
03:23:26,030 --> 03:23:26,730
I hate you!

3712
03:23:26,770 --> 03:23:27,570
I hate you!

3713
03:23:27,690 --> 03:23:28,370
I hate you!

3714
03:23:31,830 --> 03:23:32,250
I...

3715
03:23:32,250 --> 03:23:33,450
It's out of the game?

3716
03:23:36,430 --> 03:23:37,930
I just want to reset it.

3717
03:23:39,910 --> 03:23:40,390
Escape!

3718
03:23:41,110 --> 03:23:42,050
You guys...

3719
03:23:42,770 --> 03:23:44,550
You guys want to hear my new keyboard?

3720
03:23:45,570 --> 03:23:46,450
Listen to this.

3721
03:23:46,670 --> 03:23:47,430
It was sent to me.

3722
03:23:47,470 --> 03:23:49,110
It's a custom mint keyboard.

3723
03:23:49,850 --> 03:23:50,630
Listen, listen.

3724
03:23:50,710 --> 03:23:51,370
It's so creamy.

3725
03:23:52,110 --> 03:23:54,650
Here, I'll turn off the noise gate.

3726
03:24:05,340 --> 03:24:07,060
I fucking hate Tigger.

3727
03:24:07,180 --> 03:24:08,260
That guy sucks ass.

3728
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:21,980
I hope tonight he doesn't wake up and I hope... I hope he has the worst nightmare before he dies and stays dead eternally.

3729
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:30,820
I hope he never finds love and I hope he also never finds joy.

3730
03:24:30,960 --> 03:24:39,900
I hope Tigger rots in hell for an eternity and never sees a happy day.

3731
03:24:40,340 --> 03:24:44,120
Ever again in his miserable life.

3732
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:45,920
I hope his tail breaks.

3733
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,480
I hope his eyes break.

3734
03:24:49,620 --> 03:24:51,860
I hope his mouth breaks.

3735
03:24:52,200 --> 03:24:53,400
I hope his...

3736
03:24:53,400 --> 03:24:56,040
I hope his ears break.

3737
03:24:56,180 --> 03:24:58,320
I hope his nose breaks.

3738
03:24:58,620 --> 03:25:05,840
I hope every part of him is in agony every day for the rest of his life.

3739
03:25:06,080 --> 03:25:10,060
I hope he is never healthy again.

3740
03:25:10,340 --> 03:25:11,020
And happy.

3741
03:25:11,300 --> 03:25:14,900
Never ever ever ever ever ever again.

3742
03:25:16,380 --> 03:25:17,560
Signed, Minto.

3743
03:25:24,480 --> 03:25:25,860
Doesn't it sound so creepy?

3744
03:25:26,720 --> 03:25:29,120
Doesn't it sound so creamy and nice?

3745
03:25:35,630 --> 03:25:36,350
Okay.

3746
03:25:44,010 --> 03:25:45,290
It's very satisfying.

3747
03:25:53,300 --> 03:25:54,020
One.

3748
03:25:54,020 --> 03:25:54,740
Two.

3749
03:25:55,160 --> 03:25:55,960
That's in.

3750
03:25:56,040 --> 03:25:56,300
That's in.

3751
03:25:56,420 --> 03:25:57,380
That was in.

3752
03:25:58,080 --> 03:25:59,240
They're against me.

3753
03:25:59,760 --> 03:26:00,340
One.

3754
03:26:00,460 --> 03:26:00,720
Two.

3755
03:26:09,070 --> 03:26:10,510
That was two.

3756
03:26:12,330 --> 03:26:13,890
I got them tingles.

3757
03:26:16,250 --> 03:26:16,990
I know.

3758
03:26:18,130 --> 03:26:19,570
ASMR tingles.

3759
03:26:20,690 --> 03:26:21,270
One.

3760
03:26:21,370 --> 03:26:21,670
Two.

3761
03:26:28,390 --> 03:26:28,970
One.

3762
03:26:29,030 --> 03:26:29,350
Two.

3763
03:26:29,430 --> 03:26:29,810
Shit.

3764
03:26:31,590 --> 03:26:32,170
One.

3765
03:26:32,350 --> 03:26:32,750
Two.

3766
03:26:33,230 --> 03:26:33,870
That's in.

3767
03:26:33,990 --> 03:26:34,250
That's in.

3768
03:26:34,290 --> 03:26:34,610
That's in.

3769
03:26:34,630 --> 03:26:34,910
That's in.

3770
03:26:34,910 --> 03:26:35,050
No.

3771
03:26:45,240 --> 03:26:45,860
One.

3772
03:26:46,020 --> 03:26:46,260
Two.

3773
03:26:46,580 --> 03:26:47,180
Damn it.

3774
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:50,000
One of those threats instead of a happy birthday song.

3775
03:26:51,560 --> 03:26:53,420
Stop distracting me, please.

3776
03:26:53,640 --> 03:26:54,180
One.

3777
03:26:54,180 --> 03:26:54,560
Two.

3778
03:26:57,340 --> 03:26:58,180
For sure.

3779
03:27:01,140 --> 03:27:01,760
One.

3780
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:02,120
Two.

3781
03:27:08,310 --> 03:27:08,930
One.

3782
03:27:09,010 --> 03:27:09,530
Two.

3783
03:27:15,530 --> 03:27:16,150
One.

3784
03:27:16,170 --> 03:27:16,530
Two.

3785
03:27:17,710 --> 03:27:17,830
One.

3786
03:27:17,830 --> 03:27:17,830
Two.

3787
03:27:17,830 --> 03:27:18,530
Oh my god.

3788
03:27:18,530 --> 03:27:19,510
Thank goodness for the speed.

3789
03:27:19,710 --> 03:27:20,990
Otherwise, we wouldn't have made that.

3790
03:27:23,030 --> 03:27:23,550
One.

3791
03:27:23,710 --> 03:27:23,990
Two.

3792
03:27:25,150 --> 03:27:26,190
Holy cow.

3793
03:27:26,290 --> 03:27:27,330
I don't know how we made that either.

3794
03:27:30,470 --> 03:27:30,990
One.

3795
03:27:31,270 --> 03:27:31,630
Two.

3796
03:27:34,950 --> 03:27:35,990
Holy moly.

3797
03:27:38,300 --> 03:27:38,820
One.

3798
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:39,300
Two.

3799
03:27:39,520 --> 03:27:39,840
Damn.

3800
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:43,160
One.

3801
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:44,440
Two.

3802
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:45,220
Ah.

3803
03:27:45,220 --> 03:27:46,000
Damn.

3804
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:46,700
Damn.

3805
03:27:49,700 --> 03:27:50,140
Two.

3806
03:27:51,240 --> 03:27:52,780
I keep getting fouls though.

3807
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:53,980
I keep getting fouls.

3808
03:27:55,200 --> 03:27:55,640
One.

3809
03:27:55,700 --> 03:27:56,020
Two.

3810
03:28:02,230 --> 03:28:02,590
One.

3811
03:28:02,750 --> 03:28:03,030
Two.

3812
03:28:03,550 --> 03:28:03,990
No.

3813
03:28:04,450 --> 03:28:05,490
How is that a foul?

3814
03:28:05,630 --> 03:28:06,570
I did not even move.

3815
03:28:08,570 --> 03:28:09,010
Shit.

3816
03:28:09,050 --> 03:28:09,450
Okay.

3817
03:28:10,930 --> 03:28:11,370
One.

3818
03:28:11,490 --> 03:28:11,870
Two.

3819
03:28:12,970 --> 03:28:14,730
Please stop donating to me.

3820
03:28:17,290 --> 03:28:18,950
I instinctually look over at the chat.

3821
03:28:19,270 --> 03:28:19,390
Please stop.

3822
03:28:19,950 --> 03:28:20,550
One.

3823
03:28:20,650 --> 03:28:20,950
Two.

3824
03:28:21,470 --> 03:28:24,950
You guys are ruining my game.

3825
03:28:25,130 --> 03:28:25,570
For real.

3826
03:29:44,660 --> 03:29:45,540
Blindfold run.

3827
03:29:45,860 --> 03:29:46,460
One.

3828
03:29:46,540 --> 03:29:46,900
Two.

3829
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:47,700
Fuck you.

3830
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:49,220
I fucking hate you.

3831
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:49,980
One.

3832
03:29:49,980 --> 03:29:50,300
Two.

3833
03:29:52,200 --> 03:29:52,800
Okay.

3834
03:29:54,260 --> 03:29:56,300
I'm not drooling from rage, everybody.

3835
03:29:56,780 --> 03:29:57,380
One.

3836
03:29:57,480 --> 03:29:57,820
Two.

3837
03:30:04,220 --> 03:30:04,700
One.

3838
03:30:04,700 --> 03:30:05,060
Two.

3839
03:30:05,340 --> 03:30:08,260
Why is the Japanese version more difficult than the English version?

3840
03:30:11,800 --> 03:30:12,280
One.

3841
03:30:12,380 --> 03:30:12,760
Two.

3842
03:30:19,380 --> 03:30:19,860
One.

3843
03:30:20,020 --> 03:30:20,280
Two.

3844
03:30:23,780 --> 03:30:24,960
What makes it...

3845
03:30:24,960 --> 03:30:27,320
What I mean is what makes it more difficult than the English version.

3846
03:30:27,500 --> 03:30:28,120
If you know.

3847
03:30:35,240 --> 03:30:35,940
Oh, shoot.

3848
03:30:36,040 --> 03:30:36,260
Okay.

3849
03:30:40,970 --> 03:30:41,810
Harder to read.

3850
03:30:41,890 --> 03:30:42,830
That sounds like a skill issue.

3851
03:30:45,410 --> 03:30:45,890
One.

3852
03:30:45,910 --> 03:30:46,290
Two.

3853
03:30:46,870 --> 03:30:46,910
One.

3854
03:30:48,790 --> 03:30:49,270
Two.

3855
03:30:49,650 --> 03:30:52,090
People didn't know about the upgrades because Japanese...

3856
03:30:55,550 --> 03:30:57,090
It's not really that it's harder.

3857
03:30:57,270 --> 03:30:58,510
It's just they didn't know the upgrades.

3858
03:30:58,910 --> 03:31:01,550
It's literally in the instructions.

3859
03:31:01,750 --> 03:31:03,450
It literally shows you pictures.

3860
03:31:06,370 --> 03:31:07,630
It shows you pictures.

3861
03:31:07,630 --> 03:31:08,950
You don't even have to read it.

3862
03:31:12,590 --> 03:31:13,190
One.

3863
03:31:13,190 --> 03:31:13,470
Two.

3864
03:31:20,060 --> 03:31:20,660
One.

3865
03:31:20,740 --> 03:31:21,080
Two.

3866
03:31:21,280 --> 03:31:21,600
One.

3867
03:31:21,780 --> 03:31:21,920
Two.

3868
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:22,200
One.

3869
03:31:22,480 --> 03:31:22,480
Two.

3870
03:31:22,480 --> 03:31:23,160
Maybe I...

3871
03:31:23,680 --> 03:31:23,980
One.

3872
03:31:24,020 --> 03:31:24,320
Two.

3873
03:31:24,380 --> 03:31:24,900
Shoot.

3874
03:31:25,400 --> 03:31:26,000
One.

3875
03:31:27,180 --> 03:31:27,500
Two.

3876
03:31:28,180 --> 03:31:29,980
Maybe because I look...

3877
03:31:29,980 --> 03:31:31,720
I wear weeb glasses.

3878
03:31:32,380 --> 03:31:32,980
One.

3879
03:31:34,680 --> 03:31:34,980
Two.

3880
03:31:35,100 --> 03:31:36,500
I wear weeb glasses.

3881
03:31:36,900 --> 03:31:39,280
The glasses I bought in Japan.

3882
03:31:39,280 --> 03:31:41,420
I can understand the Japanese pictures.

3883
03:31:46,260 --> 03:31:48,580
You know, since the upgrades though, I haven't gotten...

3884
03:31:48,580 --> 03:31:49,140
One.

3885
03:31:49,340 --> 03:31:49,620
Two.

3886
03:31:49,740 --> 03:31:51,380
I haven't gotten any just hits though.

3887
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:53,860
I've gotten only home runs.

3888
03:31:54,420 --> 03:31:55,820
So, that does help.

3889
03:31:58,180 --> 03:31:58,800
That's in.

3890
03:31:58,920 --> 03:31:59,220
No!

3891
03:31:59,500 --> 03:32:00,340
That was in!

3892
03:32:01,300 --> 03:32:02,560
It went in the green!

3893
03:32:02,700 --> 03:32:04,080
It went in the green!

3894
03:32:06,440 --> 03:32:07,400
Please recount!

3895
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:08,180
Please recount!

3896
03:32:08,180 --> 03:32:08,300
Please recount!

3897
03:32:13,640 --> 03:32:14,200
Shoot.

3898
03:32:30,910 --> 03:32:31,830
It's in the green.

3899
03:32:32,150 --> 03:32:32,710
Yes.

3900
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:39,300
It's in the green!

3901
03:32:43,640 --> 03:32:45,880
It was in the green!

3902
03:32:48,540 --> 03:32:49,740
It was in the green.

3903
03:32:58,350 --> 03:33:00,330
It's not the green that matters, it's the angle.

3904
03:33:04,510 --> 03:33:05,070
It's not the green that matters, it's the angle.

3905
03:33:10,010 --> 03:33:11,270
That's it.

3906
03:33:11,330 --> 03:33:12,110
That's it everybody.

3907
03:33:12,370 --> 03:33:13,510
That's game.

3908
03:33:14,370 --> 03:33:15,330
That's game.

3909
03:33:20,210 --> 03:33:21,190
That's game.

3910
03:33:21,530 --> 03:33:21,790
That's game.

3911
03:33:25,740 --> 03:33:27,300
Tough time never lasts.

3912
03:33:27,800 --> 03:33:29,520
Only tough people last.

3913
03:33:30,340 --> 03:33:31,980
Blah blah blah blah.

3914
03:33:32,440 --> 03:33:33,280
Blah blah blah blah.

3915
03:33:41,130 --> 03:33:42,490
Blah blah blah blah.

3916
03:33:42,490 --> 03:33:42,990
Please.

3917
03:33:43,510 --> 03:33:45,410
I got 20 home runs.

3918
03:33:45,610 --> 03:33:46,270
Does it even matter?

3919
03:33:48,870 --> 03:33:50,310
Does it even matter?

3920
03:33:50,310 --> 03:33:51,390
Does it even matter if I got 20?

3921
03:33:51,870 --> 03:33:53,150
Does it even matter?

3922
03:33:57,640 --> 03:33:58,520
Immediate foul.

3923
03:33:59,220 --> 03:34:00,500
This game is foul.

3924
03:34:00,840 --> 03:34:02,540
This game is rigged.

3925
03:34:02,620 --> 03:34:03,940
This game is rigged.

3926
03:34:04,280 --> 03:34:05,940
This game is rigged.

3927
03:34:07,980 --> 03:34:11,240
I swear it's a dice roll on whether it's a foul or not.

3928
03:34:11,340 --> 03:34:12,300
I swear to god.

3929
03:34:12,640 --> 03:34:13,720
It's gotta be.

3930
03:34:15,940 --> 03:34:17,700
It's gotta be a dice roll.

3931
03:34:23,760 --> 03:34:25,940
It's gotta be a dice roll.

3932
03:34:26,520 --> 03:34:28,540
It's gotta be a dice roll.

3933
03:34:28,900 --> 03:34:29,500
Oops.

3934
03:34:31,400 --> 03:34:32,140
That's me.

3935
03:34:34,220 --> 03:34:35,160
Oh my god.

3936
03:34:35,420 --> 03:34:36,240
Excuse you.

3937
03:34:37,600 --> 03:34:38,480
Too close.

3938
03:34:39,780 --> 03:34:42,200
You're throwing it directly at my body.

3939
03:34:42,280 --> 03:34:43,380
That is a foul.

3940
03:34:43,640 --> 03:34:44,300
To you.

3941
03:34:44,860 --> 03:34:45,460
Tigger.

3942
03:34:46,800 --> 03:34:50,110
To you.

3943
03:34:50,330 --> 03:34:50,330
Tigger.

3944
03:34:50,410 --> 03:34:51,190
You're a fool.

3945
03:34:58,800 --> 03:35:02,180
See if I hadn't had the power on that, that would have been just a hit.

3946
03:35:03,460 --> 03:35:04,060
Damn it.

3947
03:35:08,670 --> 03:35:09,350
Damn it.

3948
03:35:10,490 --> 03:35:11,150
Damn it.

3949
03:35:28,660 --> 03:35:29,980
Why is everything a foul?

3950
03:35:30,280 --> 03:35:31,380
Why is

3951
03:35:36,870 --> 03:35:38,270
everything a foul?

3952
03:35:38,270 --> 03:35:38,930
Why is everything a foul?

3953
03:35:38,930 --> 03:35:39,350
Why is everything a foul?

3954
03:36:08,390 --> 03:36:10,030
There's no crying in baseball.

3955
03:36:12,390 --> 03:36:13,530
I'm not crying.

3956
03:36:14,650 --> 03:36:15,510
I'm not crying.

3957
03:36:18,130 --> 03:36:19,170
I'm not crying.

3958
03:36:20,950 --> 03:36:22,090
I'm not crying.

3959
03:36:24,030 --> 03:36:25,050
I'm not crying.

3960
03:36:25,710 --> 03:36:26,830
I'm not crying.

3961
03:36:29,430 --> 03:36:30,090
I'm not crying.

3962
03:36:30,090 --> 03:36:30,390
That's it.

3963
03:36:31,410 --> 03:36:33,330
The game is officially unwinnable.

3964
03:36:34,390 --> 03:36:35,470
I'm not crying.

3965
03:36:37,690 --> 03:36:38,790
You're crying.

3966
03:36:42,610 --> 03:36:43,400
I'm not crying.

3967
03:36:53,700 --> 03:36:54,680
I'm not crying.

3968
03:36:59,690 --> 03:37:00,890
I'm not crying.

3969
03:37:07,910 --> 03:37:08,470
I'm not crying.

3970
03:37:08,470 --> 03:37:08,530
I'm not crying.

3971
03:37:08,530 --> 03:37:10,210
I wish we could pay for more balls.

3972
03:37:10,770 --> 03:37:10,910
I wish we could pay for more balls.

3973
03:37:11,570 --> 03:37:13,190
Tigger, I'll give you...

3974
03:37:13,190 --> 03:37:16,050
Please, Tigger, give me more balls.

3975
03:37:16,970 --> 03:37:17,530
Please.

3976
03:37:22,430 --> 03:37:22,990
Tigger.

3977
03:37:22,990 --> 03:37:25,090
Tigger, please, I'll give you more balls.

3978
03:37:25,390 --> 03:37:25,810
Please.

3979
03:37:27,030 --> 03:37:29,350
I mean, you give me more balls.

3980
03:37:29,390 --> 03:37:29,710
Please.

3981
03:37:34,830 --> 03:37:36,750
Tigger, just like 20 more balls.

3982
03:37:37,310 --> 03:37:39,070
Just like 20 more balls.

3983
03:37:40,190 --> 03:37:41,350
I'll even take 10.

3984
03:37:41,550 --> 03:37:42,830
I'll take 10 more balls.

3985
03:37:43,170 --> 03:37:45,350
Please, Tigger, just 10 more balls.

3986
03:37:46,250 --> 03:37:47,290
Please, Tigger.

3987
03:37:48,230 --> 03:37:49,090
Please, Tigger.

3988
03:37:49,190 --> 03:37:49,950
I just need 10.

3989
03:37:52,290 --> 03:37:54,250
Ask if you want to eat babies.

3990
03:37:54,250 --> 03:37:54,410
Ask if you want to eat babies.

3991
03:38:00,790 --> 03:38:03,230
Still the tutorial for Christopher Robin.

3992
03:38:13,780 --> 03:38:14,340
Shhh...

3993
03:38:15,420 --> 03:38:16,600
Eat shit, Tigger.

3994
03:38:19,300 --> 03:38:21,020
I hope you'll never get to bounce again.

3995
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:23,500
I hope

3996
03:38:34,760 --> 03:38:34,760
you'll never get to bounce again.

3997
03:38:34,760 --> 03:38:35,400
Fuck you, Tigger.

3998
03:38:36,020 --> 03:38:36,880
Fuck you.

3999
03:38:37,280 --> 03:38:39,000
Fuck your family.

4000
03:38:39,220 --> 03:38:39,820
Fuck your mom.

4001
03:38:39,900 --> 03:38:40,480
Fuck your dad.

4002
03:38:40,680 --> 03:38:42,380
Fuck whoever created you.

4003
03:38:42,380 --> 03:38:49,740
I hope

4004
03:38:58,590 --> 03:39:05,910
they never... I hope... I hope they go to unfreeze his head down there, and he is just a pile of mush.

4005
03:39:06,510 --> 03:39:08,770
I hope Disney is just a pile of mush.

4006
03:39:08,830 --> 03:39:11,530
They were like, we got his frozen head and he's just...

4007
03:39:12,750 --> 03:39:17,650
He's just been... He's gelled into nothingness, so they can't even unfreeze him.

4008
03:39:19,030 --> 03:39:20,290
The mouse is coming?

4009
03:39:20,410 --> 03:39:20,610
Good.

4010
03:39:21,170 --> 03:39:21,970
Take me.

4011
03:39:22,330 --> 03:39:23,590
End my suffering.

4012
03:39:46,310 --> 03:39:50,030
I can't even win this anymore, so just...

4013
03:39:58,830 --> 03:40:01,350
You guys, I'm seeing the light.

4014
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:02,830
Oh my god.

4015
03:40:03,730 --> 03:40:05,110
I'm seeing the light.

4016
03:40:06,430 --> 03:40:07,550
I think...

4017
03:40:08,730 --> 03:40:10,730
I think I'm leaving the afterlife.

4018
03:40:11,830 --> 03:40:12,870
Oh my god.

4019
03:40:14,010 --> 03:40:15,270
Where am I gonna go?

4020
03:40:15,790 --> 03:40:16,670
To heaven?

4021
03:40:16,910 --> 03:40:17,210
No.

4022
03:40:17,690 --> 03:40:19,470
I'm definitely going to hell.

4023
03:40:20,090 --> 03:40:21,170
Oh my god.

4024
03:40:21,490 --> 03:40:23,970
Maybe I'll be reincarnated as a bug.

4025
03:40:24,210 --> 03:40:28,450
And then Tigger will fucking squash me with his stupid ass fucking tail.

4026
03:40:28,650 --> 03:40:31,710
That he doesn't give a shit about who's in his way.

4027
03:40:31,890 --> 03:40:34,050
As he bounces down the hundred acre woods.

4028
03:40:34,250 --> 03:40:35,650
That guy's gonna pummel me.

4029
03:40:35,650 --> 03:40:35,750
That guy's gonna pummel me.

4030
03:40:35,770 --> 03:40:42,130
I'll be in the ground with my one fucking antenna sticking out of the dirt and I'll be like, That guy...

4031
03:40:42,870 --> 03:40:44,870
That's the guy that took me out.

4032
03:40:46,410 --> 03:40:47,730
It's a bug's life.

4033
03:41:15,820 --> 03:41:17,160
Okay, I'm fine.

4034
03:41:17,280 --> 03:41:17,620
Okay.

4035
03:41:18,480 --> 03:41:19,360
Okay, I'm fine.

4036
03:41:21,740 --> 03:41:22,640
I'm not fine.

4037
03:41:59,410 --> 03:42:01,650
I just keep getting fouled.

4038
03:42:13,670 --> 03:42:14,830
You need to lock in.

4039
03:42:14,930 --> 03:42:15,330
You're right.

4040
03:42:15,490 --> 03:42:15,970
You're right.

4041
03:42:16,370 --> 03:42:17,090
You're right.

4042
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:18,510
You're right.

4043
03:42:18,750 --> 03:42:19,390
You're right.

4044
03:42:20,170 --> 03:42:21,350
I need to lock in.

4045
03:42:22,150 --> 03:42:23,570
I need to lock in.

4046
03:42:23,910 --> 03:42:25,230
I need to lock in.

4047
03:42:26,510 --> 03:42:27,030
Okay.

4048
03:42:28,610 --> 03:42:29,430
Next round.

4049
03:42:30,990 --> 03:42:32,430
I need to lock in.

4050
03:42:32,470 --> 03:42:33,270
Next round.

4051
03:42:43,390 --> 03:42:44,850
Maybe I'll go get another snack.

4052
03:42:46,810 --> 03:42:47,850
Or rather dinner.

4053
03:42:48,050 --> 03:42:48,890
I don't really have dinner.

4054
03:42:56,400 --> 03:42:57,660
You need to lock in.

4055
03:42:57,760 --> 03:43:00,300
No, lock in next time, you guys.

4056
03:43:01,040 --> 03:43:01,820
You need to lock in.

4057
03:43:01,820 --> 03:43:01,820
No, lock in next time, you guys.

4058
03:43:01,820 --> 03:43:03,340
This one was unbeatable from the start.

4059
03:43:04,160 --> 03:43:07,100
This one was unbeatable from the start.

4060
03:43:15,650 --> 03:43:18,450
But I'm afraid that if I eat, I'll lose the timing.

4061
03:43:19,470 --> 03:43:20,090
You know?

4062
03:43:20,490 --> 03:43:22,830
The game was rigged from the start.

4063
03:43:23,230 --> 03:43:26,830
Thank you for the 10 gift, dude.

4064
03:43:36,270 --> 03:43:37,650
Food helped before, right?

4065
03:43:38,570 --> 03:43:39,050
Yeah.

4066
03:43:39,050 --> 03:43:40,430
Okay, I'm gonna go get my food.

4067
03:43:40,750 --> 03:43:41,950
While he keeps pitching.

4068
03:43:42,230 --> 03:43:42,930
I'll be right back.

4069
03:43:43,970 --> 03:43:44,830
I'll be fast.

4070
03:43:45,090 --> 03:43:46,810
I don't even need to heat it up.

4071
03:44:27,690 --> 03:44:29,610
I made it back just in time.

4072
03:44:29,970 --> 03:44:31,690
You guys wanna know my fortune?

4073
03:44:32,390 --> 03:44:34,570
Let's read my fortune from the fortune cookie.

4074
03:44:35,350 --> 03:44:36,130
Okay, guys.

4075
03:44:36,230 --> 03:44:36,970
What's it gonna say?

4076
03:44:38,950 --> 03:44:39,470
Okay.

4077
03:44:40,150 --> 03:44:40,890
Calm down.

4078
03:44:42,630 --> 03:44:43,150
The...

4079
03:44:43,150 --> 03:44:45,410
What's my fortune gonna say?

4080
03:44:45,990 --> 03:44:47,730
It's gonna say...

4081
03:44:49,070 --> 03:44:50,030
Oh my god.

4082
03:44:50,050 --> 03:44:50,730
There's a lot?

4083
03:44:50,890 --> 03:44:51,090
Okay.

4084
03:44:52,900 --> 03:44:54,150
It's gonna say...

4085
03:45:08,560 --> 03:45:09,880
It says...

4086
03:45:10,370 --> 03:45:11,900
Be gentle with yourself.

4087
03:45:12,260 --> 03:45:14,780
You're doing the best you can.

4088
03:45:28,390 --> 03:45:29,370
Oh my god.

4089
03:45:29,390 --> 03:45:31,910
All the condensation from the box is like dripping on me.

4090
03:45:33,270 --> 03:45:33,930
Oh

4091
03:45:41,540 --> 03:45:41,660
my god.

4092
03:45:41,660 --> 03:45:42,680
All the condensation from the box is like dripping on me.

4093
03:45:43,200 --> 03:45:43,680
No.

4094
03:45:54,340 --> 03:45:55,780
Be gentle with yourself.

4095
03:45:56,060 --> 03:45:57,500
You're doing the best you can.

4096
03:45:59,000 --> 03:46:00,160
How did it know?

4097
03:46:03,020 --> 03:46:03,860
What did I get?

4098
03:46:04,720 --> 03:46:06,540
This is Chinese food I got over there.

4099
03:46:09,960 --> 03:46:11,240
That's why I had a fortune cookie.

4100
03:46:20,440 --> 03:46:23,220
You'll have to hit one ball for every tear wisps have shed.

4101
03:46:23,580 --> 03:46:25,000
And haven't I hit enough?

4102
03:46:25,200 --> 03:46:26,640
Wait, it's actually from Tigger.

4103
03:46:31,500 --> 03:46:33,200
You're brave showing your face here.

4104
03:46:36,360 --> 03:46:37,320
You're brave.

4105
03:46:42,890 --> 03:46:43,430
You're brave.

4106
03:46:44,770 --> 03:46:45,730
You're brave.

4107
03:46:46,550 --> 03:46:47,030
You're brave.

4108
03:46:51,980 --> 03:46:52,660
Get him.

4109
03:46:52,700 --> 03:46:53,520
Get his ass everybody.

4110
03:46:54,340 --> 03:46:55,960
I'm eating so I can't.

4111
03:46:56,220 --> 03:46:57,660
But you guys get his ass.

4112
03:47:00,060 --> 03:47:00,500
Please.

4113
03:47:01,700 --> 03:47:02,560
Masking really nicely.

4114
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:16,660
You got it boss.

4115
03:47:17,840 --> 03:47:19,180
She's been trying for four hours.

4116
03:47:19,220 --> 03:47:21,120
She doesn't know how to beat Tigger in Home Run Derby.

4117
03:47:21,300 --> 03:47:21,940
She's crying.

4118
03:47:22,140 --> 03:47:23,060
What's wrong with you?

4119
03:47:25,020 --> 03:47:25,460
Get

4120
03:47:29,810 --> 03:47:30,470
that guy too.

4121
03:47:30,790 --> 03:47:31,950
Get that guy too.

4122
03:47:33,010 --> 03:47:33,950
Get them all.

4123
03:47:39,280 --> 03:47:41,260
What would Pooh, how would Pooh's throw be?

4124
03:47:41,540 --> 03:47:48,840
What if instead of Christopher Robin, it was like Christopher Robin wearing like a skin suit of Pooh Bear.

4125
03:47:49,500 --> 03:47:52,080
And Pooh Bear is just like, suddenly there's a cut scene.

4126
03:47:52,800 --> 03:47:57,880
And he walks in and he's just like, he's like, ho ho ho, rumbly my tumbly.

4127
03:47:58,180 --> 03:48:02,560
They're just like, and Pooh Bear's just like, Christopher Robin.

4128
03:48:07,340 --> 03:48:11,440
And Christopher Robin is just like, I'm not Christopher Robin.

4129
03:48:11,960 --> 03:48:13,340
I'm Winnie the Pooh.

4130
03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:18,120
And he's like, it's just insane.

4131
03:48:25,900 --> 03:48:30,680
And he's like, there can only be one Pooh Bear in the Hundred Acre Woods.

4132
03:48:33,360 --> 03:48:35,680
And so Pooh is actually fighting for his life.

4133
03:48:47,360 --> 03:48:48,440
Did you beat the game?

4134
03:48:48,900 --> 03:48:50,440
I got nine home runs.

4135
03:48:55,720 --> 03:48:56,800
Four in a row though.

4136
03:48:57,400 --> 03:48:58,180
That's kinda cool.

4137
03:49:05,300 --> 03:49:07,720
I was really locked in for that four.

4138
03:49:15,670 --> 03:49:17,410
Solid Pooh versus Liquid Pooh.

4139
03:49:17,510 --> 03:49:17,730
Solid Pooh versus Liquid Pooh.

4140
03:49:17,750 --> 03:49:18,010
Why?

4141
03:49:18,010 --> 03:49:18,550
Eww.

4142
03:49:20,870 --> 03:49:21,510
Stop!

4143
03:49:25,810 --> 03:49:27,370
Why would you say that?

4144
03:49:43,970 --> 03:49:46,490
I know your intention, but...

4145
03:49:48,050 --> 03:49:49,330
Please consider...

4146
03:49:49,330 --> 03:49:51,690
Please consider what you're saying.

4147
03:49:56,930 --> 03:49:58,890
Please consider what...

4148
03:49:58,890 --> 03:50:00,390
Please consider what...

4149
03:50:00,390 --> 03:50:04,590
Please consider what...

4150
03:50:07,140 --> 03:50:07,620
Okay.

4151
03:50:08,640 --> 03:50:09,660
I think I'm good.

4152
03:50:14,470 --> 03:50:15,590
Wait, one more chicken.

4153
03:50:22,970 --> 03:50:24,250
Better than Naked Pooh?

4154
03:50:24,390 --> 03:50:28,150
No, no, I think Naked Pooh is the best out of all of those.

4155
03:50:36,690 --> 03:50:38,330
Now my pants are all wet.

4156
03:50:40,290 --> 03:50:40,930
Okay.

4157
03:50:45,450 --> 03:50:47,530
Oh my god, so sorry.

4158
03:50:50,190 --> 03:50:51,210
Holy moly.

4159
03:50:51,410 --> 03:50:52,410
So loud.

4160
03:50:56,110 --> 03:50:56,990
So sorry.

4161
03:50:56,990 --> 03:50:58,470
My ears as well.

4162
03:50:58,590 --> 03:50:59,790
We all felt that.

4163
03:50:59,930 --> 03:51:00,430
I'm so sorry.

4164
03:51:09,140 --> 03:51:10,240
That's starting off great.

4165
03:51:12,900 --> 03:51:13,620
There we go.

4166
03:51:16,480 --> 03:51:18,780
Ow, I think I have a bruise on my...

4167
03:51:19,820 --> 03:51:20,380
Hold on.

4168
03:51:20,820 --> 03:51:21,220
Actually...

4169
03:51:23,000 --> 03:51:23,600
Hold on.

4170
03:51:32,240 --> 03:51:33,740
How did I get that on my knee?

4171
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:35,800
How did I get the bruise?

4172
03:51:36,480 --> 03:51:38,420
Okay, why can't I restart the game?

4173
03:51:40,440 --> 03:51:43,440
I'm afraid of exiting out of the game.

4174
03:51:44,700 --> 03:51:45,260
Hold on.

4175
03:51:45,320 --> 03:51:47,340
I just have to cross my legs the other way.

4176
03:51:50,260 --> 03:51:51,000
Are you okay?

4177
03:51:51,320 --> 03:51:52,440
Yeah, it just was hurting.

4178
03:51:52,640 --> 03:51:54,800
I was crossing my legs and it was hurting so bad.

4179
03:52:05,070 --> 03:52:06,430
There's no way of winning this.

4180
03:52:07,190 --> 03:52:07,590
But...

4181
03:52:09,910 --> 03:52:10,950
The run is dead.

4182
03:52:11,110 --> 03:52:11,670
It is dead.

4183
03:52:12,030 --> 03:52:12,610
It's okay.

4184
03:52:12,750 --> 03:52:15,030
We needed a little warm up.

4185
03:52:15,650 --> 03:52:16,990
After a break.

4186
03:52:17,270 --> 03:52:18,790
We needed a warm up after a break.

4187
03:52:20,950 --> 03:52:21,630
Charlie horse?

4188
03:52:21,710 --> 03:52:22,530
What's a Charlie horse?

4189
03:52:26,410 --> 03:52:27,430
Isn't that in your butt?

4190
03:52:29,830 --> 03:52:30,510
Charlie horse?

4191
03:52:32,190 --> 03:52:35,050
Actually, the run was dead from the beginning, I think.

4192
03:52:40,440 --> 03:52:42,660
I thought a Charlie horse was a pain in your butt.

4193
03:52:46,740 --> 03:52:47,540
Am I wrong?

4194
03:52:48,780 --> 03:52:49,820
It's leg cramps.

4195
03:52:52,160 --> 03:52:53,920
When you wake up with leg cramps?

4196
03:52:54,040 --> 03:52:54,840
Oh, I've never had that.

4197
03:52:59,040 --> 03:53:00,860
No, mine is a bruise on my knee.

4198
03:53:02,440 --> 03:53:04,460
I must have run into something at some point.

4199
03:53:06,420 --> 03:53:06,820
No,

4200
03:53:14,850 --> 03:53:16,250
I'm not thinking of hemorrhoids.

4201
03:53:17,310 --> 03:53:21,270
I'm thinking of like a pain, a muscle pain in your butt.

4202
03:53:28,280 --> 03:53:28,900
I'm thinking of like a pain, a muscle pain in your butt.

4203
03:53:34,900 --> 03:53:37,130
I guess I can get them out of their band practice.

4204
03:53:37,470 --> 03:53:41,930
Wow Maybe you should stretch more.

4205
03:53:43,630 --> 03:53:44,870
What allegations??

4206
03:53:45,910 --> 03:53:47,110
What allegations?

4207
03:53:54,040 --> 03:53:55,380
You hurting my butt.

4208
03:53:57,260 --> 03:53:58,720
Butt pain and sciatica.

4209
03:53:58,880 --> 03:53:59,560
I have that.

4210
03:54:00,300 --> 03:54:01,480
That's a little different.

4211
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:08,780
That's a nerve... well, I guess it would be a muscle thing is a nerve thing too, right?

4212
03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:09,760
Well, it's a little different.

4213
03:54:13,540 --> 03:54:15,260
I have sciatica.

4214
03:54:16,640 --> 03:54:17,580
So I know.

4215
03:54:19,260 --> 03:54:20,420
The butt pains.

4216
03:54:22,720 --> 03:54:24,860
The nerves of the butt.

4217
03:54:25,400 --> 03:54:27,080
My butt nerves are bad.

4218
03:54:27,540 --> 03:54:30,060
Actually, my hip is like slanted.

4219
03:54:30,220 --> 03:54:32,400
So like it just kind of caves in on...

4220
03:54:32,400 --> 03:54:34,540
and it shifts all the time.

4221
03:54:37,940 --> 03:54:39,100
Okay, lock in.

4222
03:55:11,570 --> 03:55:12,430
One, two.

4223
03:55:14,770 --> 03:55:15,690
One, two.

4224
03:55:40,500 --> 03:55:41,700
Moving him closer.

4225
03:55:42,340 --> 03:55:42,900
I...

4226
03:55:45,120 --> 03:55:49,200
I have a better understanding of the timing of where he's at now.

4227
03:55:49,420 --> 03:55:50,480
So that's why I don't...

4228
03:55:54,230 --> 03:55:54,990
You see?

4229
03:56:01,390 --> 03:56:01,930
Damn it.

4230
03:56:07,440 --> 03:56:08,700
That was me being too...

4231
03:56:09,420 --> 03:56:11,660
Oh, that was me being too late because it was a fast one.

4232
03:56:13,760 --> 03:56:14,300
That's in?

4233
03:56:14,580 --> 03:56:14,980
Yeah.

4234
03:56:28,510 --> 03:56:29,590
Guys, it's so over.

4235
03:56:30,410 --> 03:56:31,430
It's so over.

4236
03:56:33,610 --> 03:56:34,770
This is not the run.

4237
03:56:36,790 --> 03:56:37,870
It's so over.

4238
03:56:37,970 --> 03:56:38,730
It's so over.

4239
03:56:40,850 --> 03:56:43,050
There should be like a cheat code you can input.

4240
03:56:43,770 --> 03:56:44,430
It gives you like...

4241
03:56:44,430 --> 03:56:44,630
like a set of...

4242
03:56:44,630 --> 03:56:46,030
goggles.

4243
03:56:48,310 --> 03:56:49,650
It's so over.

4244
03:56:52,370 --> 03:56:53,850
It'd take a miracle.

4245
03:56:53,970 --> 03:56:54,550
It really would.

4246
03:56:56,110 --> 03:56:57,350
It would take a miracle.

4247
03:56:59,290 --> 03:57:00,770
It's so over.

4248
03:57:04,630 --> 03:57:05,390
And

4249
03:57:17,410 --> 03:57:18,170
that's...

4250
03:57:18,170 --> 03:57:18,810
That's it.

4251
03:57:21,710 --> 03:57:22,470
Ugh...

4252
03:57:22,470 --> 03:57:23,490
I

4253
03:57:28,600 --> 03:57:30,180
wish there were save states.

4254
03:57:30,460 --> 03:57:31,200
Me too!

4255
03:57:33,160 --> 03:57:34,740
I'm running this off of Ruffle.

4256
03:57:34,900 --> 03:57:36,260
I don't know if they do it.

4257
03:57:36,680 --> 03:57:42,020
If it does save states for flash stuff.

4258
03:58:16,640 --> 03:58:18,700
I was doing so well, you guys.

4259
03:58:19,480 --> 03:58:21,240
I was doing so well!

4260
03:58:24,000 --> 03:58:29,240
I was doing so well!

4261
03:58:32,860 --> 03:58:34,200
I hate when the foul counts as a miss.

4262
03:58:34,440 --> 03:58:36,800
I feel like it should count as like...

4263
03:58:36,800 --> 03:58:39,820
You should have a do-over, you know?

4264
03:58:40,020 --> 03:58:41,260
At least a do-over.

4265
03:58:50,830 --> 03:58:51,630
Four off.

4266
03:59:04,380 --> 03:59:07,880
Saving between rounds is too much, I think.

4267
03:59:30,130 --> 03:59:31,610
Yeah, at least let you restart.

4268
03:59:31,990 --> 03:59:32,970
That's the big one.

4269
03:59:33,190 --> 03:59:35,630
Don't make me go through the whole thing.

4270
03:59:50,130 --> 03:59:52,030
Oh shoot, I was too far off.

4271
03:59:54,870 --> 03:59:55,570
That's in.

4272
04:00:01,670 --> 04:00:02,210
Nice!

4273
04:00:08,970 --> 04:00:10,630
That was too far over.

4274
04:00:19,910 --> 04:00:20,810
I'm focused.

4275
04:00:21,570 --> 04:00:22,390
I'm focused.

4276
04:00:29,410 --> 04:00:29,950
Foul!

4277
04:00:29,950 --> 04:00:30,030
Foul!

4278
04:01:03,090 --> 04:01:03,710
That's in.

4279
04:01:10,270 --> 04:01:11,070
That's a foul.

4280
04:01:12,890 --> 04:01:15,250
These fowls are gonna f-ing end me, man.

4281
04:01:15,410 --> 04:01:16,010
Oh no!

4282
04:01:17,110 --> 04:01:19,670
It's these fowls that are gonna f-ing end me!

4283
04:01:19,990 --> 04:01:23,310
I was

4284
04:01:40,900 --> 04:01:42,440
doing so well in the beginning!

4285
04:01:43,140 --> 04:01:43,380
Ouch!

4286
04:01:43,560 --> 04:01:44,720
My knee!

4287
04:02:15,270 --> 04:02:17,490
I'm ready to commit murder.

4288
04:02:21,990 --> 04:02:23,090
I'm ready to commit murder.

4289
04:02:23,090 --> 04:02:23,490
Kill Tigger.

4290
04:02:24,510 --> 04:02:26,930
Look at him with his stupid f-ing ball.

4291
04:02:28,510 --> 04:02:29,590
I hate you.

4292
04:02:30,030 --> 04:02:31,510
I hate you so much.

4293
04:02:31,830 --> 04:02:34,150
His stupid smug smile.

4294
04:02:42,310 --> 04:02:44,410
If I can't hit the ball...

4295
04:02:45,350 --> 04:02:47,150
I'll just slice and dice it.

4296
04:02:55,800 --> 04:02:56,920
You guys...

4297
04:02:59,200 --> 04:03:00,820
Tiger is on the menu tonight.

4298
04:03:15,110 --> 04:03:15,830
That's in.

4299
04:03:15,910 --> 04:03:16,290
That's in.

4300
04:03:16,310 --> 04:03:16,570
That's in.

4301
04:03:17,270 --> 04:03:17,830
Nice!

4302
04:03:21,810 --> 04:03:22,370
Shoot.

4303
04:03:30,890 --> 04:03:31,950
Well, they're endangered.

4304
04:03:32,490 --> 04:03:33,050
Yeah.

4305
04:03:33,850 --> 04:03:34,410
Good.

4306
04:03:37,930 --> 04:03:38,650
Actually, no.

4307
04:03:38,710 --> 04:03:39,790
I really like tigers.

4308
04:03:41,450 --> 04:03:43,250
I really like tigers.

4309
04:03:50,950 --> 04:03:52,390
I almost didn't make that one.

4310
04:03:53,110 --> 04:03:54,610
I almost did not make that one.

4311
04:03:56,930 --> 04:03:57,290
Damn.

4312
04:03:57,350 --> 04:03:58,630
I definitely did not make that one.

4313
04:04:10,130 --> 04:04:12,530
I feel like I'm actually in like a f-ing...

4314
04:04:16,450 --> 04:04:18,770
Like... Shonen... Like a sports anime.

4315
04:04:22,070 --> 04:04:24,350
Cause I have to be so... There's no time to rest.

4316
04:04:24,550 --> 04:04:25,590
I wish there was like a...

4317
04:04:26,690 --> 04:04:27,710
Next round start.

4318
04:04:29,430 --> 04:04:29,790
Oh.

4319
04:04:29,810 --> 04:04:30,990
No, no, no, no, no, no.

4320
04:04:31,050 --> 04:04:31,310
Oh my god.

4321
04:04:31,350 --> 04:04:31,650
That was me.

4322
04:04:33,030 --> 04:04:33,790
What the hell?

4323
04:04:33,910 --> 04:04:34,270
Oh my god.

4324
04:04:34,330 --> 04:04:34,950
What's wrong with me?

4325
04:04:35,030 --> 04:04:35,630
What's happening?

4326
04:04:36,570 --> 04:04:37,370
What's happening to me?

4327
04:04:51,630 --> 04:04:52,190
Damn it.

4328
04:04:54,490 --> 04:04:55,270
I'll be honest.

4329
04:04:55,410 --> 04:04:57,950
I'm not even... I don't even pay attention to the music anymore.

4330
04:05:00,610 --> 04:05:01,410
I don't even...

4331
04:05:01,410 --> 04:05:03,490
I don't even hear it.

4332
04:05:06,930 --> 04:05:07,330
No!

4333
04:05:08,050 --> 04:05:08,450
No!

4334
04:05:08,450 --> 04:05:08,550
No!

4335
04:05:21,720 --> 04:05:26,520
You know, you counting down how many fails I have left doesn't really help me.

4336
04:05:27,900 --> 04:05:29,680
Okay, so please don't do that.

4337
04:05:39,000 --> 04:05:39,640
That's it.

4338
04:05:47,410 --> 04:05:48,510
Shoken desu.

4339
04:05:48,790 --> 04:05:49,570
Oh, sorry.

4340
04:05:51,610 --> 04:05:52,190
Today...

4341
04:05:52,190 --> 04:05:52,830
Um...

4342
04:05:54,110 --> 04:05:54,480
Um...

4343
04:05:54,970 --> 04:05:55,710
Um...

4344
04:05:55,710 --> 04:05:56,450
Um...

4345
04:05:56,450 --> 04:05:56,570
Um...

4346
04:05:56,570 --> 04:05:56,670
Um...

4347
04:05:56,670 --> 04:06:01,850
I went a little crazy.

4348
04:06:03,990 --> 04:06:04,730
Um...

4349
04:06:04,730 --> 04:06:05,570
Um...

4350
04:06:05,840 --> 04:06:06,790
I'm sorry if I said...

4351
04:06:06,790 --> 04:06:08,110
I'm sorry if I said...

4352
04:06:08,110 --> 04:06:09,470
I'm sorry if I said...

4353
04:06:10,250 --> 04:06:11,810
I'm sorry if I said...

4354
04:06:11,810 --> 04:06:12,790
I'm sorry if I said...

4355
04:06:13,570 --> 04:06:14,630
I'm sorry if I said...

4356
04:06:14,630 --> 04:06:15,050
Wow!

4357
04:06:18,210 --> 04:06:19,770
I actually managed to go backwards!

4358
04:06:20,750 --> 04:06:23,270
That's more impressive than anything else, I think.

4359
04:06:54,270 --> 04:06:56,650
I have this knife so close to my eyes.

4360
04:06:56,950 --> 04:06:58,910
I'm going to gouge my eyes out!

4361
04:06:59,130 --> 04:06:59,990
For real!

4362
04:07:13,600 --> 04:07:18,220
I want to go back to an hour ago and I thought Tigger was no problem.

4363
04:07:20,180 --> 04:07:20,820
Oh, shoot.

4364
04:07:20,960 --> 04:07:21,540
That was me.

4365
04:07:31,580 --> 04:07:32,620
Sing a melody?

4366
04:07:32,960 --> 04:07:36,040
His throw is a different speed every time.

4367
04:07:41,980 --> 04:07:43,620
So you can't really do that.

4368
04:08:01,170 --> 04:08:03,130
You're so eloquent when you curse at the game.

4369
04:08:03,630 --> 04:08:04,410
Thank you!

4370
04:08:06,530 --> 04:08:07,870
Yeah, kill Tigger!

4371
04:08:09,270 --> 04:08:10,270
Kill him dead!

4372
04:08:12,130 --> 04:08:14,770
Pooh will have no friends at this point.

4373
04:08:16,850 --> 04:08:19,310
We're taking out everybody in the 100 acre woods.

4374
04:08:20,110 --> 04:08:21,390
Burn the floors down!

4375
04:08:49,700 --> 04:08:52,620
Yeah, 100 acres won't be enough for them to hide.

4376
04:08:57,880 --> 04:09:00,280
Guys, is this currently still winnable?

4377
04:09:00,520 --> 04:09:01,220
Yeah, never mind.

4378
04:09:01,260 --> 04:09:01,580
Just kidding.

4379
04:09:01,700 --> 04:09:02,260
I can do math.

4380
04:09:04,200 --> 04:09:05,440
It's kind of still winnable.

4381
04:09:06,260 --> 04:09:08,200
I just don't have very much room to fail.

4382
04:09:20,740 --> 04:09:21,220
Oh!

4383
04:09:26,540 --> 04:09:28,680
Now it's not winnable anymore.

4384
04:09:30,540 --> 04:09:32,700
Now it's not winnable anymore.

4385
04:09:39,220 --> 04:09:40,260
Gotta restart.

4386
04:09:40,580 --> 04:09:41,780
If the game would let me!

4387
04:09:44,180 --> 04:09:45,900
If the game would let me!

4388
04:10:15,940 --> 04:10:17,360
I'm coming after you, Tigger.

4389
04:10:17,360 --> 04:10:18,720
I'm coming after you.

4390
04:10:21,300 --> 04:10:22,480
There's even bases.

4391
04:10:23,000 --> 04:10:24,680
But they don't use them.

4392
04:10:30,810 --> 04:10:33,050
I wonder if upping my speed will do anything.

4393
04:10:37,390 --> 04:10:37,950
Okay,

4394
04:10:42,750 --> 04:10:43,550
let's try that.

4395
04:10:44,830 --> 04:10:46,250
The meat and the speed.

4396
04:11:00,470 --> 04:11:01,770
The meat might help.

4397
04:11:07,150 --> 04:11:07,670
Shoot.

4398
04:11:14,900 --> 04:11:16,680
Four hours isn't even that long.

4399
04:11:19,180 --> 04:11:21,560
Been on the plane the whole day so I missed most of the stream.

4400
04:11:21,880 --> 04:11:22,620
Are you having fun?

4401
04:11:22,780 --> 04:11:23,980
I'm having so much fun.

4402
04:11:25,420 --> 04:11:25,940
Thanks.

4403
04:11:26,300 --> 04:11:26,740
Yeah.

4404
04:11:47,860 --> 04:11:50,000
Is the fun in the room what it does?

4405
04:11:52,660 --> 04:11:53,840
You guys are having fun?

4406
04:11:54,600 --> 04:11:57,300
I actually enjoy challenge games like this.

4407
04:11:59,980 --> 04:12:00,460
Depending.

4408
04:12:01,120 --> 04:12:04,140
This one is like repetitive enough that it makes me feel fine.

4409
04:12:05,560 --> 04:12:06,920
Are you guys having fun?

4410
04:12:28,390 --> 04:12:28,870
Yeah?

4411
04:12:31,030 --> 04:12:32,990
Is it because I'm holding a knife?

4412
04:12:35,670 --> 04:12:37,970
That you feel like you have to say that?

4413
04:12:41,110 --> 04:12:42,930
Yeah, maybe a little.

4414
04:13:00,130 --> 04:13:02,450
I don't feel comfortable answering that.

4415
04:13:03,410 --> 04:13:03,950
Okay.

4416
04:13:07,010 --> 04:13:07,550
Five.

4417
04:13:09,450 --> 04:13:10,890
Oh, that was my fault.

4418
04:13:10,950 --> 04:13:11,710
I wasn't over enough.

4419
04:13:29,890 --> 04:13:30,430
Sure.

4420
04:13:31,830 --> 04:13:32,990
Souls like when?

4421
04:13:33,370 --> 04:13:34,550
Maybe when I get back.

4422
04:13:36,630 --> 04:13:37,470
Oh, shoot.

4423
04:13:37,510 --> 04:13:37,930
That was fast.

4424
04:13:38,130 --> 04:13:38,430
Okay.

4425
04:13:40,410 --> 04:13:40,910
Nice

4426
04:13:51,790 --> 04:13:52,470
and diced.

4427
04:14:03,450 --> 04:14:03,950
Celeste.

4428
04:14:05,230 --> 04:14:05,730
Yeah.

4429
04:14:05,750 --> 04:14:07,430
That game is pretty brutal from what I've heard.

4430
04:14:13,750 --> 04:14:16,030
That game is pretty brutal from what I've heard, Celeste.

4431
04:14:48,280 --> 04:14:48,780
Shit.

4432
04:14:59,170 --> 04:14:59,670
Shit.

4433
04:15:53,330 --> 04:15:54,130
Let's try.

4434
04:15:54,670 --> 04:15:56,330
I wasn't even thinking of Tigger.

4435
04:15:56,690 --> 04:15:57,370
Oh, wait.

4436
04:15:57,370 --> 04:16:00,950
Wait, did anybody see what my home run score was in a row?

4437
04:16:01,090 --> 04:16:03,410
Because it was like so much.

4438
04:16:03,770 --> 04:16:05,550
I was just trying to like ignore it.

4439
04:16:06,890 --> 04:16:07,410
Robin...

4440
04:16:10,250 --> 04:16:10,770
I

4441
04:16:14,160 --> 04:16:14,540
lost!

4442
04:16:24,620 --> 04:16:25,140
Shoot.

4443
04:16:28,080 --> 04:16:30,680
Wait, they only give you 10 chances to mess up?

4444
04:16:30,920 --> 04:16:32,220
And you have to get 40?

4445
04:16:32,660 --> 04:16:33,560
That's insane.

4446
04:16:35,720 --> 04:16:36,580
Oh my god.

4447
04:16:36,660 --> 04:16:38,100
Wait, I don't remember how to do that one.

4448
04:16:39,180 --> 04:16:40,520
Oh no, no, no, no.

4449
04:16:44,290 --> 04:16:45,010
That's insane!

4450
04:16:50,360 --> 04:16:52,080
Oh fuck, I don't remember how to do that one.

4451
04:16:52,160 --> 04:16:53,400
And it's really fast!

4452
04:16:54,660 --> 04:16:56,660
He's really fast!

4453
04:17:01,920 --> 04:17:03,240
Training wheels are off.

4454
04:17:04,040 --> 04:17:04,660
Oh fuck.

4455
04:17:05,200 --> 04:17:06,320
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

4456
04:17:07,720 --> 04:17:08,480
Oh my god.

4457
04:17:13,650 --> 04:17:15,430
Congrats on making it to the Dark Lord.

4458
04:17:16,030 --> 04:17:18,910
I think... oh my god, I forgot his trigger.

4459
04:17:22,050 --> 04:17:24,010
This is still technically winnable.

4460
04:17:26,910 --> 04:17:29,270
This is still technically winnable!

4461
04:17:34,570 --> 04:17:36,630
This is still technically winnable!

4462
04:17:42,400 --> 04:17:43,120
Dang it.

4463
04:17:43,440 --> 04:17:45,280
This is not winnable anymore.

4464
04:17:45,740 --> 04:17:49,320
Wait, I think... I think it actually still is technically winnable.

4465
04:17:50,220 --> 04:17:51,960
I think this is still technically winnable.

4466
04:17:54,580 --> 04:17:55,140
Dang it.

4467
04:17:55,160 --> 04:17:55,620
No, it's not.

4468
04:18:00,780 --> 04:18:03,100
Oh, did you just see me right click?

4469
04:18:04,100 --> 04:18:05,480
I pressed all the buttons.

4470
04:18:06,500 --> 04:18:08,280
Oh, that was me not being...

4471
04:18:14,030 --> 04:18:16,070
Oh, I'm not even close to the center.

4472
04:18:16,290 --> 04:18:18,290
He only pitches in the center though.

4473
04:18:19,030 --> 04:18:19,470
Interesting.

4474
04:18:19,470 --> 04:18:19,750
Interesting.

4475
04:18:22,990 --> 04:18:25,170
He only pitches in the center though.

4476
04:18:29,310 --> 04:18:30,850
These rounds are long.

4477
04:18:31,110 --> 04:18:37,770
Yeah, I don't think I'm... especially because we can't reset the round when it's over.

4478
04:18:38,250 --> 04:18:39,290
I think I'm good.

4479
04:18:40,170 --> 04:18:42,210
I think I'm good.

4480
04:18:42,590 --> 04:18:44,930
Oh, I said he only pitched to the... wait.

4481
04:18:45,070 --> 04:18:49,650
I said he only pitched to the middle, but he just did it to the side, I think.

4482
04:18:56,040 --> 04:18:57,160
Let's see how far I can get though.

4483
04:18:58,020 --> 04:18:59,820
If I can get to halfway, I'll con...

4484
04:19:02,630 --> 04:19:04,610
If I can get to 20, I'll consider that a win.

4485
04:19:22,450 --> 04:19:24,710
Best I've seen anyone go on Chris is 39 out of 40.

4486
04:19:24,770 --> 04:19:25,830
So what happens if you win?

4487
04:19:27,550 --> 04:19:28,450
Oh, that was me.

4488
04:19:31,370 --> 04:19:31,730
Damn.

4489
04:19:39,160 --> 04:19:41,180
He throws at basically the same speed.

4490
04:19:42,120 --> 04:19:43,060
Nothing, you just win.

4491
04:19:43,380 --> 04:19:44,060
Oh my god.

4492
04:19:44,120 --> 04:19:44,680
I said that.

4493
04:19:44,720 --> 04:19:46,520
I said he throws at the same speed, but...

4494
04:19:50,390 --> 04:19:52,570
Get the self-satisfaction.

4495
04:19:55,090 --> 04:19:56,210
So nothing happens?

4496
04:19:56,310 --> 04:19:57,110
There's no like...

4497
04:19:57,110 --> 04:19:57,850
Congratulations!

4498
04:19:58,550 --> 04:19:59,590
You beat everybody!

4499
04:20:02,090 --> 04:20:03,230
Oh, whoopsie.

4500
04:20:05,650 --> 04:20:06,610
Oh, whoopsie.

4501
04:20:12,010 --> 04:20:12,930
20!

4502
04:20:12,930 --> 04:20:13,850
Christopher

4503
04:20:21,460 --> 04:20:22,020
Robin!

4504
04:20:31,030 --> 04:20:33,110
It's only games that love their players.

4505
04:20:34,850 --> 04:20:35,130
Oh, shoot.

4506
04:20:35,270 --> 04:20:35,710
Oh my god.

4507
04:20:38,850 --> 04:20:41,610
I love that it's the invisible ones that I'm okay with now.

4508
04:20:43,190 --> 04:20:44,910
Watch this be a zigzag motherfu...

4509
04:20:44,910 --> 04:20:45,830
Oh, nevermind.

4510
04:20:51,540 --> 04:20:52,360
Look at him.

4511
04:20:52,540 --> 04:20:53,640
Look at that face.

4512
04:20:54,480 --> 04:20:55,580
Look at that face.

4513
04:20:56,460 --> 04:20:57,800
Three home runs in a row.

4514
04:21:02,770 --> 04:21:03,830
So proud of you.

4515
04:21:04,010 --> 04:21:04,550
Thank you.

4516
04:21:04,850 --> 04:21:05,310
Hehehe.

4517
04:21:06,570 --> 04:21:07,050
Hehehe.

4518
04:21:07,310 --> 04:21:07,470
Hehehe.

4519
04:21:07,470 --> 04:21:07,890
Oh.

4520
04:21:08,710 --> 04:21:09,190
Oh.

4521
04:21:09,790 --> 04:21:10,270
Hehehe.

4522
04:21:11,110 --> 04:21:11,590
Kamii game.

4523
04:21:13,010 --> 04:21:13,570
Ouch.

4524
04:21:15,190 --> 04:21:15,750
Yes.

4525
04:21:15,990 --> 04:21:17,010
Oh my gosh.

4526
04:21:17,330 --> 04:21:19,910
Maybe one day we'll do the Christopher Robin special.

4527
04:21:21,050 --> 04:21:22,170
But, um...

4528
04:21:22,170 --> 04:21:26,270
Gosh, only allowing you to mess up 10 times is really, really brutal.

4529
04:21:26,670 --> 04:21:27,510
I think.

4530
04:21:28,890 --> 04:21:29,450
Oh!

4531
04:21:30,010 --> 04:21:31,090
We did it!

4532
04:21:31,890 --> 04:21:33,250
We did it, everybody!

4533
04:21:34,050 --> 04:21:35,470
Stage 1 through 7.

4534
04:21:35,830 --> 04:21:37,010
Pro Gamer Minto.

4535
04:21:37,130 --> 04:21:38,650
Not many people can say they beat Tigger.

4536
04:21:38,730 --> 04:21:39,370
Stand proud!

4537
04:21:40,270 --> 04:21:40,410
Yeah!

4538
04:21:45,730 --> 04:21:47,970
I won't subject you guys to that anymore.

4539
04:21:53,190 --> 04:21:54,590
The Tigger victory.

4540
04:21:55,170 --> 04:21:59,310
And, in my eyes, the Christopher Robin half...

4541
04:21:59,310 --> 04:22:00,410
Halfly done.

4542
04:22:01,730 --> 04:22:04,230
You beat Tigger so easily, but she is such a gamer.

4543
04:22:04,530 --> 04:22:07,250
You came in nano and I was just like, oh, I can't look dumb.

4544
04:22:07,310 --> 04:22:09,610
I can't... I can't look dumb when you're watching.

4545
04:22:10,110 --> 04:22:10,470
So...

4546
04:22:13,350 --> 04:22:14,510
I have to look cool.

4547
04:22:14,650 --> 04:22:17,130
I have to... I have to look like this is a piece of cake.

4548
04:22:21,350 --> 04:22:22,470
Congrats on hitting 23.

4549
04:22:23,130 --> 04:22:25,610
I wanted to mention the game Super Mega Baseball 4.

4550
04:22:25,690 --> 04:22:26,890
It's an arcade game that has co-op.

4551
04:22:26,950 --> 04:22:28,330
You might like it because of batting mechanic.

4552
04:22:28,570 --> 04:22:29,530
And because you enjoy this game.

4553
04:22:29,670 --> 04:22:29,810
Oh!

4554
04:22:30,210 --> 04:22:31,510
Yeah, I enjoy this game so much.

4555
04:22:32,270 --> 04:22:33,090
Thanks for the ping!

4556
04:22:33,390 --> 04:22:34,950
Congrats on getting as far as Pikamee.

4557
04:22:35,070 --> 04:22:35,890
Have fun at Otakutan.

4558
04:22:36,190 --> 04:22:36,850
Thank you!

4559
04:22:39,070 --> 04:22:39,590
Yes.

4560
04:22:40,650 --> 04:22:41,730
Next time for sure.

4561
04:22:43,970 --> 04:22:45,210
Yeah, yeah, Tigger.

4562
04:22:45,470 --> 04:22:46,130
Yeah, yeah.

4563
04:22:46,210 --> 04:22:47,290
Same time next week.

4564
04:22:48,030 --> 04:22:49,630
Same time next week, buddy.

4565
04:22:50,270 --> 04:22:52,610
Owl, I think, was the hardest, though, for me.

4566
04:22:54,390 --> 04:22:56,150
Owl, I think, was pretty difficult.

4567
04:22:56,450 --> 04:22:57,490
I missed the Tigger victory.

4568
04:22:57,850 --> 04:22:58,770
Could you do it again?

4569
04:23:00,090 --> 04:23:00,610
Okay!

4570
04:23:04,270 --> 04:23:04,790
Oh!

4571
04:23:05,670 --> 04:23:06,190
Oh!

4572
04:23:06,310 --> 04:23:06,830
Oh!

4573
04:23:06,850 --> 04:23:07,830
I think with Tigger.

4574
04:23:08,170 --> 04:23:09,070
What took so...

4575
04:23:09,070 --> 04:23:09,830
Well, I'm going to say this.

4576
04:23:10,090 --> 04:23:13,610
You know, you guys will probably be like, no, that's copium.

4577
04:23:14,790 --> 04:23:18,870
But I definitely, in between, started losing focus.

4578
04:23:20,570 --> 04:23:22,030
I would like focus...

4579
04:23:22,030 --> 04:23:30,230
I would like lock on and then for like 12 rounds, I'd be like, I'm just talking with chat and not paying attention to the game at all.

4580
04:23:30,350 --> 04:23:35,030
And I was just like, I should probably pay attention to the game.

4581
04:23:39,910 --> 04:23:40,650
No attention.

4582
04:23:41,050 --> 04:23:46,150
But then I started to lock in, and sometimes I would lock in and I'd be like, ah, it's too hard.

4583
04:23:46,410 --> 04:23:47,690
I would lock in and I'd be frustrated.

4584
04:23:47,950 --> 04:23:49,590
Then I'd lock in and I'd be good.

4585
04:23:51,090 --> 04:23:52,590
I could tell by your eyes.

4586
04:23:55,230 --> 04:23:55,630
Yeah.

4587
04:23:56,270 --> 04:23:56,670
Yeah.

4588
04:23:57,450 --> 04:23:58,150
Well, guys.

4589
04:24:00,490 --> 04:24:01,650
I'm going to be...

4590
04:24:03,590 --> 04:24:06,830
I'm going to be at Otaku-Thon this weekend, if you are as well.

4591
04:24:06,830 --> 04:24:09,150
If not, then, you know, that's fine, too.

4592
04:24:09,210 --> 04:24:09,670
I'll see you.

4593
04:24:12,570 --> 04:24:13,910
So I don't know when that...

4594
04:24:13,910 --> 04:24:14,350
I'll be honest.

4595
04:24:14,410 --> 04:24:16,170
I'm not sure the next time I'm going to be able to stream.

4596
04:24:18,730 --> 04:24:20,130
Hopefully sometime next week.

4597
04:24:20,290 --> 04:24:23,650
But next week, straight from Otaku-Thon, I'm going to Japan.

4598
04:24:23,850 --> 04:24:26,710
So it's going to be quite a bit.

4599
04:24:31,670 --> 04:24:36,370
So maybe it will be a week off of Minto.

4600
04:24:36,370 --> 04:24:37,490
A week off of Minto.

4601
04:24:39,170 --> 04:24:40,530
If so, I'm really sorry.

4602
04:24:41,030 --> 04:24:44,430
I'll try and stream sometime later next week.

4603
04:24:45,290 --> 04:24:50,070
Like, you know, Friday, Saturday time, you know.

4604
04:24:51,990 --> 04:24:53,570
Hopefully if I'm not too jet lagged.

4605
04:24:53,590 --> 04:25:00,170
Actually, the jet lag might be good because I'll be able to stream at a normal time for you guys.

4606
04:25:02,590 --> 04:25:04,370
But, wow, she hates us.

4607
04:25:04,530 --> 04:25:05,130
Safe travels.

4608
04:25:05,130 --> 04:25:06,310
Thanks, Sushi!

4609
04:25:07,790 --> 04:25:09,210
You make me want to have sushi.

4610
04:25:11,590 --> 04:25:13,250
Never heard of Otaku-Thon?

4611
04:25:13,870 --> 04:25:14,570
Otaku-Con?

4612
04:25:14,750 --> 04:25:15,430
Otaku-Thon!

4613
04:25:16,090 --> 04:25:18,070
It's in Montreal, Canada.

4614
04:25:18,810 --> 04:25:19,450
Yeah, yeah.

4615
04:25:24,630 --> 04:25:25,910
Stay safe, Minto.

4616
04:25:26,290 --> 04:25:27,190
Don't overdo it.

4617
04:25:27,310 --> 04:25:27,590
I won't.

4618
04:25:27,830 --> 04:25:28,250
I won't.

4619
04:25:28,290 --> 04:25:28,710
Don't worry.

4620
04:25:28,850 --> 04:25:29,070
Don't worry.

4621
04:25:31,330 --> 04:25:33,250
Minto, stream at an Asia-friendly time?

4622
04:25:33,450 --> 04:25:33,630
Probably.

4623
04:25:33,630 --> 04:25:35,490
I think it will be...

4624
04:25:40,420 --> 04:25:43,370
It will be depending on what my schedule is.

4625
04:25:43,970 --> 04:25:46,490
So, sometimes it might be like early...

4626
04:25:46,490 --> 04:25:47,490
Like morning...

4627
04:25:47,490 --> 04:25:51,930
Rather, it will be morning JST or night JST.

4628
04:25:52,210 --> 04:25:55,230
So, one or the other.

4629
04:25:56,350 --> 04:26:00,050
Which would be morning EST or night EST.

4630
04:26:00,970 --> 04:26:01,810
Yeah, yeah.

4631
04:26:02,550 --> 04:26:02,860
So...

4632
04:26:07,260 --> 04:26:08,640
We'll hold the maid cafe...

4633
04:26:08,640 --> 04:26:10,400
We'll hold down the maid cafe while you're in Japan.

4634
04:26:10,640 --> 04:26:11,800
Just like last time.

4635
04:26:11,940 --> 04:26:12,640
Thank you!

4636
04:26:13,780 --> 04:26:16,980
Yeah, I'm sorry that I've been traveling so much recently, you guys.

4637
04:26:17,060 --> 04:26:17,760
But after...

4638
04:26:17,760 --> 04:26:18,860
After this...

4639
04:26:18,860 --> 04:26:19,520
After this...

4640
04:26:19,520 --> 04:26:25,300
After I return from Japan, I will be not traveling for quite some time.

4641
04:26:25,620 --> 04:26:26,040
So...

4642
04:26:29,400 --> 04:26:30,260
Yes, yes, yes.

4643
04:26:32,360 --> 04:26:32,840
So, I'll see you all soon.

4644
04:26:39,380 --> 04:26:39,620
Bye!

4645
04:26:49,360 --> 04:26:50,020
I love you all!

4646
04:26:50,720 --> 04:26:50,820
Bye.

4647
04:26:50,940 --> 04:26:59,100
Bye -bye, Thailand.

4648
04:26:59,240 --> 04:26:59,480
Bye!

4649
04:27:00,320 --> 04:27:00,800
Take care!

4650
04:27:00,880 --> 04:27:01,120
Bye-bye.

4651
04:27:01,180 --> 04:27:01,460
Bye-bye, Australia!

4652
04:27:01,460 --> 04:27:01,880
Bye-bye...

4653
04:27:02,580 --> 04:27:02,820
Bye.

4654
04:27:12,640 --> 04:27:14,280
It's hot in Japan, so be careful.

4655
04:27:32,820 --> 04:27:33,880
I heard it was in Birmingham.

4656
04:27:34,200 --> 04:27:35,760
That sounds correct.

4657
04:27:44,460 --> 04:27:45,560
Merch store soon?

4658
04:27:47,000 --> 04:27:51,840
That... hopefully I can get it set up while I'm in Japan.

4659
04:27:54,760 --> 04:27:58,160
Hopefully I can get it set up while I'm in Japan.

4660
04:27:58,360 --> 04:27:59,680
I'm hoping like...

4661
04:27:59,680 --> 04:28:06,760
I was originally hoping for an August 1st opening, but it might be like mid-August.

4662
04:28:07,020 --> 04:28:13,980
And then things probably shipping out like mid-September or so.

4663
04:28:14,680 --> 04:28:15,240
Depending.

4664
04:28:16,180 --> 04:28:17,560
Mid to late September.

4665
04:28:18,000 --> 04:28:21,800
Well, actually that's... some things will come in in time.

4666
04:28:22,240 --> 04:28:23,720
Other things will be later.

4667
04:28:24,000 --> 04:28:28,180
Like obviously the dakimakura is not even done, so I haven't even been able to get it printed.

4668
04:28:28,840 --> 04:28:29,400
And...

4669
04:28:30,860 --> 04:28:33,720
But I might have like... you know, I might do it in waves.

4670
04:28:33,960 --> 04:28:36,120
So it's not all just everything at once.

4671
04:28:36,840 --> 04:28:43,440
Because also... then if someone's just like, Oh, I want to buy the plushie, but I also want to buy the dakimakura.

4672
04:28:43,480 --> 04:28:44,220
I can't do both.

4673
04:28:44,560 --> 04:28:50,160
If you know, you can do the plushie one month and then a couple months later, you can do the dakimakura.

4674
04:28:52,520 --> 04:28:54,720
Then it could be... it could work out, you know.

4675
04:28:55,040 --> 04:28:57,300
So... might stagger it a little bit.

4676
04:28:58,400 --> 04:28:59,480
For that reason.

4677
04:29:00,700 --> 04:29:01,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4678
04:29:01,980 --> 04:29:02,740
Okey dokey.

4679
04:29:02,840 --> 04:29:06,780
I'm gonna head out and I'm gonna go finish my food.

4680
04:29:08,000 --> 04:29:09,440
And my... and rest.

4681
04:29:10,500 --> 04:29:11,860
And... oh, I have to pack.

4682
04:29:12,240 --> 04:29:16,570
I have to pack.

4683
04:29:16,610 --> 04:29:18,370
I have to finish signing postcards.

4684
04:29:18,550 --> 04:29:20,070
I'm gonna go do that.

4685
04:29:20,990 --> 04:29:21,830
Thank you everybody.

4686
04:29:22,030 --> 04:29:23,390
Congrats on beating Tigger.

4687
04:29:23,490 --> 04:29:25,470
That right there is why you're my Oshibos.

4688
04:29:25,730 --> 04:29:27,050
Sorry, I was making a sandwich.

4689
04:29:28,270 --> 04:29:29,730
Thanks James Cameron!

4690
04:29:31,210 --> 04:29:32,670
Thank you guys for all the superdots.

4691
04:29:32,790 --> 04:29:34,850
For all the... all the donations.

4692
04:29:35,190 --> 04:29:36,850
I really, really, really appreciate it.

4693
04:29:38,170 --> 04:29:38,610
And...

4694
04:29:40,550 --> 04:29:40,990
Yeah!

4695
04:29:43,850 --> 04:29:46,770
I'm really worried that if I exit out of this game...

4696
04:29:49,250 --> 04:29:50,330
It'll not save.

4697
04:29:50,630 --> 04:29:51,450
You know what I mean?

4698
04:29:54,610 --> 04:29:56,450
I'm really worried that it won't save.

4699
04:29:57,630 --> 04:29:58,890
Should we test it out?

4700
04:30:01,890 --> 04:30:03,950
Will I have to do everything all over again?

4701
04:30:08,930 --> 04:30:09,750
Time to see.

4702
04:30:11,830 --> 04:30:13,090
Time to see.

4703
04:30:14,730 --> 04:30:17,130
Time to see if it saves everything.

4704
04:30:18,810 --> 04:30:20,150
It'll be one of those things.

4705
04:30:20,230 --> 04:30:21,490
It was all a dream.

4706
04:30:28,660 --> 04:30:30,840
Oh my god, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

4707
04:30:45,360 --> 04:30:47,380
Okay, ready for the moment of truth?

4708
04:30:50,360 --> 04:30:51,320
It saved!

4709
04:30:53,180 --> 04:30:54,420
It saved everything!

4710
04:30:56,400 --> 04:30:56,880
Yeah!

4711
04:30:57,760 --> 04:31:01,090
Go away!

4712
04:31:03,510 --> 04:31:04,090
Let's go!

4713
04:31:04,090 --> 04:31:04,130
Let's go!

4714
04:31:07,690 --> 04:31:08,290
Christopher...

4715
04:31:13,310 --> 04:31:16,850
Well guys, that means we definitely could do Christopher Robin.

4716
04:31:17,130 --> 04:31:17,810
Actually, hold on.

4717
04:31:35,400 --> 04:31:37,380
What if it wasn't Christopher Robin?

4718
04:31:38,180 --> 04:31:38,880
What if

4719
04:31:50,900 --> 04:31:53,120
it wasn't Christopher Robin?

4720
04:31:59,320 --> 04:32:01,040
See you in the Hunger Games.

4721
04:32:16,940 --> 04:32:19,060
You're not going against Christopher anymore!

4722
04:32:19,380 --> 04:32:20,540
I hate Christopher.

4723
04:32:20,820 --> 04:32:23,040
It's all about... you're going against Minto now.

4724
04:32:23,340 --> 04:32:26,120
Good luck and may your soul...

4725
04:32:28,600 --> 04:32:32,460
May... may... may Minto have pity on your soul.

4726
04:32:34,000 --> 04:32:34,600
Bye!

4727
04:32:43,210 --> 04:32:43,510
Okay.

4728
04:32:45,670 --> 04:32:46,270
Okay.

4729
04:32:49,190 --> 04:32:50,150
Good night.

4730
04:32:51,350 --> 04:32:52,550
Have a nice day!

4731
04:32:52,730 --> 04:32:53,490
Have a nice day!

4732
04:32:54,610 --> 04:32:55,450
Bye-bye!

4733
04:32:57,410 --> 04:32:59,070
See you guys next week!

4734
04:32:59,490 --> 04:33:01,010
Or I may see you at Otakutan!

4735
04:33:01,270 --> 04:33:02,290
See you at Otakutan!

4736
04:33:02,710 --> 04:33:04,990
If I see you at... what is it?

4737
04:33:04,990 --> 04:33:05,990
Oh gosh.

4738
04:33:06,110 --> 04:33:09,150
I always forget what convention I'm going to be at with Doki.

4739
04:33:09,230 --> 04:33:10,210
But if I see you there, I'll see you there!

4740
04:33:10,370 --> 04:33:12,150
Or if I see you at VEXBALL!

4741
04:33:12,190 --> 04:33:12,610
See you there!

4742
04:33:13,470 --> 04:33:14,130
Bye-bye!

4743
04:33:42,940 --> 04:33:44,840
I also forgot to mention...

4744
04:33:44,840 --> 04:33:45,740
I forgot to mention...

4745
04:33:45,740 --> 04:33:46,580
I forgot to mention...

4746
04:33:46,580 --> 04:33:48,420
Probably every stream...

4747
04:33:49,280 --> 04:33:53,560
Probably every stream while I'm in Japan will be Chibi Minto.

4748
04:33:54,220 --> 04:33:54,580
So...

4749
04:33:55,860 --> 04:33:57,360
I hope you guys don't mind.

4750
04:33:59,340 --> 04:34:01,880
That probably every stream in Japan will be Chibi Minto.

4751
04:34:02,960 --> 04:34:04,260
It's easier on my computer.

4752
04:34:04,500 --> 04:34:05,300
And everything.

4753
04:34:05,580 --> 04:34:06,020
So...

4754
04:34:06,600 --> 04:34:07,160
Yeah.

4755
04:34:10,260 --> 04:34:11,380
Thank you!

4756
04:34:11,460 --> 04:34:11,760
Bye-bye!

4757
04:34:14,160 --> 04:34:15,120
Otu Minto!

4758
04:34:15,960 --> 04:34:16,860
Otu Minto!

4759
04:34:18,040 --> 04:34:19,160
Otu Minto!

4760
04:34:20,160 --> 04:34:20,980
Bye-bye!

4761
04:34:21,620 --> 04:34:22,120
Oh!

4762
04:34:26,140 --> 04:34:27,580
I also forgot one more thing.

4763
04:34:27,580 --> 04:34:28,380
Okay.

4764
04:34:28,480 --> 04:34:29,840
This one is actually like pretty important.

4765
04:34:31,240 --> 04:34:31,640
Alright.

4766
04:34:31,840 --> 04:34:32,240
So...

4767
04:34:32,240 --> 04:34:32,920
I...
