1
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,830
What the hell was that?

2
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,610
What the hell was that?

3
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,370
Useless against it!

4
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,090
U-U-Useless against it!

5
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,550
Oh, it's over.

6
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,750
Wait, there's one part at the very beginning of this that makes me want to be like...

7
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,550
I want a remix of this song.

8
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,030
But like, you know, like old school remix song.

9
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,390
Where it's just like...

10
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,990
Boop-boop-boop-boop!

11
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,070
That's somebody's scream.

12
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,290
She says...

13
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,150
If you don't think of something, I'm gonna die here!

14
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,990
If you don't think of something, if you don't think of something, if you don't think of something, I'm gonna die!

15
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,410
Die!

16
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:26,850
Die!

17
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,290
Die!

18
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,930
D-D-D-D-D-D-Die here!

19
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,410
Nice to keep you!

20
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,390
Remembership...

21
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,610
Hello everybody!

22
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,510
Welcome back, sir and ma'am!

23
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,350
Hello... Oh, here we go.

24
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,050
Here we go!

25
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,790
B-b-b-b-b-remix!

26
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,890
Yeah, yeah, let's just do this.

27
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,130
Oh that's what it is.

28
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,750
I'm gonna die if you don't think of something quick.

29
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,170
Quick, quick, quick, quick, I'm gonna die if you don't think of something quick.

30
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,730
Dodge left, do, do, do, dodge left.

31
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,950
Dodge left, do, do, do, dodge left.

32
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,870
Number one, number two.

33
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,450
I'm gonna die here if you don't think of something quick.

34
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,710
Oh, oh, oh.

35
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,420
These are all spoilers!

36
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,580
These are all spoilers.

37
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,000
Usually, Lurk, we saw a clip of you singing Bing Bong and I was like, you sing, give it a go, Lurk.

38
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,360
Waaa!

39
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,220
Thank you, Viking Froggy.

40
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
Bing, bing bong.

41
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,540
Bing bing, bing bing bong.

42
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,440
I said come on.

43
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Wait, I don't get that one.

44
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,500
It would go so hard!

45
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Hire me, Sony!

46
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,800
Anyways guys, welcome back to Lifeline Voice Action Adventure!

47
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,780
And this should be the last time I guess we play this because I'm hoping...

48
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm gonna... well, not hoping.

49
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,820
We'll finish today.

50
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,360
Unless I get stuck in a room for like 5 hours.

51
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,740
That would be pretty... that would be pretty pathetic on my part.

52
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,820
Somebody's got a lot of energy today.

53
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,060
No, this is normal, I think.

54
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,140
I am finishing my lunch though.

55
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,420
I made some Indomie which I haven't had in a long, long time.

56
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,020
But I was like, oh gosh, I should eat something real fast.

57
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,820
And I have eggs and I don't want them to go bad, you know.

58
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,440
So I was like, I'm gonna have Indomie.

59
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
I don't eat...

60
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm back now.

61
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,340
Good night.

62
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,460
Good night!

63
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,540
Can we have some?

64
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,360
You want some?

65
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,700
It's pretty normal.

66
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,940
I actually messed up my egg.

67
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,580
I messed it up pretty bad.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,560
Especially since how pricey they are now.

69
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,160
Exactly!

70
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,540
That's why I was like, oh my gosh.

71
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,260
I can't let my eggs go bad.

72
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,740
Because they cost so much!

73
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
They're so pricey.

74
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,640
What kind of egg?

75
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,160
Sunnyside-o?

76
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,620
Thank you for the five gifted!

77
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,960
Happy Monday!

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,880
I hope Ryo actually listens for once.

79
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,040
What's bonus?

80
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,920
I just noticed this.

81
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,460
What's bonus?

82
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,360
Do I not have any bonuses?

83
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,960
I think we're this one.

84
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,540
Let's see what we got.

85
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,720
Ostrich eggs.

86
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,020
I've never had anything other than a chicken egg, I think.

87
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
Number of chips.

88
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,120
11 out of 16!

89
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,020
We're killing it, you guys!

90
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,380
Tutorial word jumble.

91
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,860
Complete the phrases.

92
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,420
The calc.

93
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,660
What's word jumble?

94
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,940
Word jumble.

95
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,860
Wait, what is this?

96
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,580
Word jumble?

97
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,220
Not the calc.

98
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,660
That wouldn't let me play...

99
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,080
Rearrange the letters on the screen to make a word and speak the word before time runs out.

100
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,680
You get three guesses per question.

101
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,420
The faster you answer, the higher the score.

102
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,440
There are 20 jumbles in each game.

103
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,880
Oh, I'm not going to do...

104
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,320
This is like my worst nightmare.

105
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,800
Ready?

106
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,400
Start.

107
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Ick.

108
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
Sick.

109
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,700
Click.

110
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
Kick.

111
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,120
Kick.

112
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,700
One.

113
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,420
Time's up.

114
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:39,980
Bad.

115
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,270
Dead.

116
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,910
Oh wait, dead.

117
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,310
How do I talk...

118
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:49,830
Dead.

119
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:51,650
Good.

120
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,490
I did it.

121
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,270
I forgot how to talk.

122
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,730
Ok, good.

123
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,630
Toba.

124
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,850
Boba.

125
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,990
Toba.

126
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,310
Bad.

127
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,050
Bato.

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,940
Sock.

129
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,200
What?

130
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,260
Sock.

131
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,400
Type them.

132
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,280
Type.

133
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,220
Type.

134
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,800
My type.

135
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,160
Payment.

136
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,880
Empty.

137
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,340
Bad.

138
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,230
Sound.

139
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,250
Excellent.

140
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,410
That one was so easy.

141
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,350
Squirrel.

142
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,410
Wait, pearl.

143
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:44,790
No.

144
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,310
Seal.

145
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,270
Five.

146
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,230
Four.

147
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,330
Reels.

148
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,010
Two.

149
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,050
One.

150
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,470
Time's up.

151
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,410
Bad.

152
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,410
Laser.

153
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,070
USB mic.

154
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:01,730
No.

155
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,950

159
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,450
One.

160
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,030
Time's up.

161
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,370
Music.

162
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,630
Oxygen.

163
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,430
Unbelievable.

164
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,690
Egg.

165
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:18,750
Egg.

166
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,890
Ugly.

167
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,290
Gauge.

168
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,740
Hoses.

169
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,740
Hose.

170
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,680
Time's up.

171
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,160
Shoes.

172
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
What?

173
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,140
Lamein.

174
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,170
Oh my gosh.

175
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,430
Horse?

176
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,150

177
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,030

195
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,430
One.

196
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:50,890
Good.

197
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,010
Four.

198
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,880
Three.

199
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,060
Two.

200
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,100
One.

201
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,360
Time's up.

202
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,640
Forward.

203
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
Paramedic.

204
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,000
Shit.

205
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
Power...

206
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Four.

207
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,900
Three.

208
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,880
Two.

209
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,040
One.

210
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,340
Time's up.

211
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,200
Approach.

212
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,120
Crochet.

213
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,080
Oh.

214
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,940
Crocket.

215
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,000
Five.

216
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,920
Four.

217
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:31,920
Three.

218
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,000
Two.

219
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,820
One.

220
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,300
Rocket.

221
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,200
No!

222
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,320
Three.

223
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,040
Two.

224
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,220
One.

225
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,200
Don't.

226
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,380
No!

227
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,180
That's literally what I'm eating!

228
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,840
Guys, I have like... So when I do those types of puzzles...

229
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,700
I don't have that thing where you...

230
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,460
Where you can't imagine things.

231
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,520
Like say someone's like, picture an apple.

232
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,380
Some people can't picture an apple in their head.

233
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,300
But I only have that when it comes to words.

234
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,440
I literally only see the word that is spelled out.

235
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,600
Even if it's not a real word.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,540
You can't picture the apple?

237
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,200
Only

238
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,060
see what is there.

239
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,880
Let's try one more time.

240
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,380
This is our warm up, everybody.

241
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,520
Alright.

242
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,380
Okay, we're gonna beat our high score.

243
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,460
We got this.

244
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,140
Back.

245
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,600
Yeah!

246
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,190
Hade.

247
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,590
Hade.

248
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,430
Hade.

249
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,010
Five.

250
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,410
Four.

251
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,010
Three.

252
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,830
Two.

253
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,230
One.

254
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,220
Head!

255
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,300
No!

256
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,960
Duck.

257
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,660
I got it, I got it, I got it.

258
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,100
Slot.

259
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,540
Slot.

260
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
Tossel?

261
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
Slot.

262
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,900
Lost!

263
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,860
Lampy.

264
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,340
Lam...

265
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,180
Mouthy.

266
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,020
Flame.

267
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,580
Flame.

268
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,180
Can't.

269
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,640
Can't.

270
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,260
I can't.

271
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Tank.

272
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,380
Oh!

273
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,720
Disrespect.

274
00:16:59,540 --> 00:16:59,680
Oh.

275
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,620
Dire...

276
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,480
Fo...

277
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,060
Spider!

278
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Careful.

279
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,740
Fookie.

280
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
What the?

281
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
This is not a real word.

282
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,100
So...

283
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,140
So...

284
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,740
Toes.

285
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,880
What?

286
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,640
The...

287
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,920
Hotel.

288
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,640
Being.

289
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,600
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

290
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,260
Oh my gosh.

291
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,400
Drink.

292
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,640
Oh, we are beating our high score for real.

293
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,080
Oh, maybe not.

294
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,180
Indecision, indecision.

295
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,820
Inside!

296
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
Question.

297
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:30,940
Yeah!

298
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,120
Corpse.

299
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,280
Oh my god, that was real!

300
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,000
Gallons.

301
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,320
Gallons.

302
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,180
Oh,

303
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,780
I thought it...I didn't realize it didn't change at first.

304
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,040
I was like, it was gallons!

305
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,420
Oops.

306
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,500
Parents.

307
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,000
Just preordered MGS Delta.

308
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,600
Yeah!

309
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know!

310
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,580
Oh my god.

311
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,000
Demolish.

312
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,140
These are impossible.

313
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,440
To...

314
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,020
Optic.

315
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,460
Action!

316
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,760
Crow.

317
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,480
Oh, wait, that's not a W.

318
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,480
Recover!

319
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,260
Oh my god, I got it!

320
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,800
Oh my god, I got...wow.

321
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,200
No more.

322
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,280
My print hurts.

323
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,550
Oh yeah!

324
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,650
Oh yeah!

325
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,550
The difference variance is wild.

326
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,110
Nucky, thanks for the gift!

327
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,670
Oh yeah!

328
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,330
Oh yeah!

329
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,490
Oh yeah!

330
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,570
There was the other thing too.

331
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,330
Complete the phrases.

332
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,610
We got this.

333
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,090
I can't believe I missed ghost.

334
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh.

335
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,120
Is this like a Mad Libs?

336
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,120
A famous phrase?

337
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh no.

338
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,240
Wait, one more.

339
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,760
It's a famous phrase?

340
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,700
OK.

341
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,900
How famous are these phrases?

342
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,780
Fire.

343
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,260
What?

344
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,700
That's what I said.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
If at first you don't succeed.

346
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,860
Bliss.

347
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,080
Christmas comes...once?

348
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,000
Is that a famous saying?

349
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,980
Exchange is real.

350
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,680
A woman's boob.

351
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,200
Money is...Root!

352
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,780
Bed?

353
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,020
It is...funny.

354
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,970
Old.

355
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,310
Make...blank all the honey in the fly...what?

356
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,190
Money?

357
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,030
Make money, honey.

358
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,250
Speak when you are...spoken.

359
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,070
Knife?

360
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:15,570
Oh.

361
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,660
Die.

362
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes?

363
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Logs.

364
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,740
Ignorance of the law...

365
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,820
Many hands make light...

366
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,260
Figures.

367
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,400
Work.

368
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,820
I've never heard that one.

369
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,240
Trust is the...opposite.

370
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:55,930
Dying.

371
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,050
Oh my god!

372
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,150
Thanks for the 50 gifted!

373
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,710
Ill weeds.

374
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,350
Thank you so much for the 50!

375
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,710
Thank you!

376
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,430
I don't know it.

377
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,290
A bully is always a piece of shit.

378
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,560
Probably like top score.

379
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,160
True, yeah.

380
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,580
It should have been counted points anyway.

381
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,640
Alright, shall we get into the game now?

382
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
Stop please!

383
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,760
I've already been tortured enough!

384
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,060
Yeah, world record everybody.

385
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,880
On complete the phrase.

386
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,570
So you're saying you wouldn't notice any hidden meaning in the name about someone owning a lot of stocks...

387
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,770
I did it!

388
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,850
I literally...That's why those kinds of things...

389
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,650
Those kinds of wordplay gets me.

390
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,110
Because I literally only see what is written until I say it out loud.

391
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,870
But not always either.

392
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,510
This is the game.

393
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,190
I wonder if there is a task bot that can nail every word.

394
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,250
Probably, right?

395
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,270
It's no fun though.

396
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,930
It's no fun!

397
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,250
Alright, we're at 11 out of 16 chips.

398
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,970
I wonder if we get the calc once we get all 16 chips.

399
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,120
Hello, real.

400
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,500
It's been a minute.

401
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,820
Get up.

402
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,560
I have to remember what controls are.

403
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,720
I think it's really just circle and then this.

404
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,360
Alright.

405
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,460
What were we doing?

406
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,560
We were headed to...

407
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,360
Actually, let's...consultation.

408
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,940
Let's get some help.

409
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Quiet, real.

410
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,460
You're also so close.

411
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,420
What to do?

412
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,800
No!

413
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,300
Consultation.

414
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,860
Help me, real.

415
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,880
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

416
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,780
Thank you.

417
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,640
Let's see.

418
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,040
What should we do?

419
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:09,900
Yeah.

420
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
It will be.

421
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,820
For you.

422
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,360
Not me.

423
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,840
I'm safe and sound in my own room.

424
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,560
Bald!

425
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,820
Welcome to membership.

426
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,040
It will forever be the cutest...

427
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,220
Stop!

428
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,620
The H gods!

429
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Sounds awesome.

430
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,660
Wait, so what are we doing then?

431
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,540
That's not what we should do.

432
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,440
That's what you should do.

433
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,440
Avoid the robot.

434
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,600
No, not robot.

435
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,000
Sorry.

436
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,600
Avoid the monster.

437
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,460
Oh wait, there's more about here.

438
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,100
No, tell me about yourself.

439
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,500
She has no patience.

440
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,660
Consultation.

441
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,380
Yeah, the sexy alien lady.

442
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,560
Okay, what would you like to know about?

443
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,980
Tell me about yourself.

444
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,060
I'm half German and half Japanese.

445
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,380
My age, measurements and hobbies are my business.

446
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,560
I didn't ask for that.

447
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,280
Occupation?

448
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,400
Waitress.

449
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,480
Will that do?

450
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,480
Okay.

451
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,500
How far away are you?

452
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,960
I bet there's something else.

453
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,820
Just ask her, yeah.

454
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,320
Hang in there just a little while longer, okay?

455
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,980
Okay.

456
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,140
That's her actually addressing me, the player, trying to get through this game.

457
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,400
Naomi wasn't there.

458
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,860
She doesn't care about...

459
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,100
Naomi wasn't there.

460
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,520
Naomi wasn't there.

461
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,460
Naomi wasn't there.

462
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,840
What should we do?

463
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,200
That humanoid monster that was in the warehouse?

464
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,080
She's actually choosing to ignore Naomi.

465
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,200
That might be the end.

466
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,180
She might be perfect.

467
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,680
Rio is truly a single-celled organism.

468
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,460
Just like I put in the title of the stream today.

469
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,980
Naomi wasn't there.

470
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,920
She wasn't at the receiving port.

471
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,820
But don't let it bring you down.

472
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,820
She's gotta be waiting patiently somewhere for rescue.

473
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,480
Naomi.

474
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,440
Naomi.

475
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,340
Oh yeah, Japanese pronunciation, right?

476
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,820
Tell me what you're looking for.

477
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,820
She's so secretive.

478
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,700
What if she's the bad guy?

479
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,150
Let's see.

480
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,390
That alien earlier.

481
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,010
Yeah.

482
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,710
Yeah.

483
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,410
So I can't see myself defeating it.

484
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,630
Yeah, why is the waitress looking for secret things?

485
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,290
Exactly.

486
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,210
Exactly.

487
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,130
Ask her about Aqua.

488
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,430
Like the idol group.

489
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:15,830
I lost my gallons to this H-God.

490
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,710
What is a gallons?

491
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,350
I hope you find it.

492
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,290
Wait, what was that one again?

493
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,530
Gallons.

494
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,390
Signal.

495
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,510
Signal.

496
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:36,350
Okay.

497
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,050
Let's go somewhere.

498
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,920
We are headed to...

499
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,300
We just saved, so we're headed to...

500
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,820
Go to Area C.

501
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,440
Run.

502
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,740
Yes.

503
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,820
Bogo is minted.

504
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,740
Things are 8 months.

505
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,120
Area C...

506
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,000
I guess that's correct.

507
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,120
Oh no!

508
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,200
Oh God.

509
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,620
That shouldn't... Wait.

510
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,220
What the heck?

511
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:16,980
Strafe.

512
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,760
Left stomach.

513
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,540
Enemy 2.

514
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,880
Enemy 2.

515
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,920
Stomach.

516
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,320
Mouth.

517
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,440
Mouth.

518
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,520
Stomach.

519
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,460
Stomach.

520
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,880
Run.

521
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,680
Enemy 1.

522
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,380
Mouth.

523
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,770
Reload.

524
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,770
Reload.

525
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,190
Or that too.

526
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,970
That works.

527
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,030
What did we say?

528
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,670
Strafe.

529
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,390
No.

530
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,070
Run.

531
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,050
Run.

532
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,050
Run.

533
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,530
Run.

534
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,990
Run.

535
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,670
Run.

536
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,070
Isn't it... Oh wait.

537
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,930
It's flee, right?

538
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,430
It's flee.

539
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,170
I remember now.

540
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:35,890
Mouth.

541
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,530
Mouth.

542
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,130
Strafe.

543
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,670
Strafe.

544
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,470
Strafe.

545
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,490
It's not doing anything.

546
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:50,990
Left stomach.

547
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,230
Reload.

548
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,530
Flee.

549
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,610
Flee.

550
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,390
There we go.

551
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,050
Okay, nice.

552
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,750
Left stomach.

553
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,570
Can't see it.

554
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,750
Right stomach.

555
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,170
Right stomach.

556
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,790
Why is it so...

557
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,250
Beefy.

558
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,250
Mouth.

559
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,330
Tail.

560
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,550
Body.

561
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,470
It's dodging everything.

562
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,090
Body.

563
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,170
Flee.

564
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,530
Strafe.

565
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,050
Oh nice, nice, nice.

566
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,070
Yeah, reload, reload.

567
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,830
Strafe.

568
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,910
I don't think she hit a single one.

569
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,470
Strafe.

570
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,310
Oh that works too, actually.

571
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,410
Oh, hinder the legs.

572
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,630
Okay.

573
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,690
Left stomach.

574
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,910
Nope.

575
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,830
Left stomach.

576
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,730
Oh, flee.

577
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,690
Hind leg.

578
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,930
Tail.

579
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,610
Left stomach.

580
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,130
Oh nice.

581
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:04,350
Flee.

582
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,710
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

583
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,330
Strafe.

584
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,750
Flee.

585
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,610
No survival instincts.

586
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,010
Red stomach.

587
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,310
Red stomach.

588
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,050
Red stomach.

589
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,490
Reload.

590
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:25,690
Oh god.

591
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,310
Oh, run.

592
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,170
Flee.

593
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,770
Mouth.

594
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,130
Oh my god.

595
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,490
Flee.

596
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,750
Oh no, no, no.

597
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,570
Flee.

598
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,910
Flee.

599
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,070
Flee.

600
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:42,850
Run.

601
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,250
Recover.

602
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,130
Recover.

603
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,330
Please recover.

604
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,810
Recover.

605
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,410
Recover.

606
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,290
Okay, good, good, good.

607
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,050
Red stomach.

608
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,670
Oh my god, I didn't even notice that she was out of bullets.

609
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,190
Flee.

610
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,890
Run.

611
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,190
Flee.

612
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,750
Red stomach.

613
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,530
Red stomach.

614
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,530
Red stomach.

615
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:15,910
Flee.

616
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,350
Red stomach.

617
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,830
Ah, flee.

618
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,590
Red stomach.

619
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,430
Oh my god.

620
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:25,970
Body.

621
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,090
Body.

622
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,990
Red stomach.

623
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,930
Oh my god, we got it.

624
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,530
Yeah, I wonder whose fault that is that we couldn't move on any faster.

625
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:38,970
Huh, Rio?

626
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,260
My goodness gracious.

627
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,730
This is the final boss.

628
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,610
Okay.

629
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,280
I always have to remember not to scream at her because she just...

630
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,910
I try, I like, imagine the energy of the vibe, but I'm just like, flee!

631
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,190
Flee!

632
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,770
Go to area C.

633
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,410
There's a guy here, right?

634
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,070
Oh, nope.

635
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,550
Okay.

636
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,130
Go to area B.

637
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,570
Hell yeah.

638
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,350
Is she running?

639
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,750
Oh, there's nothing here either?

640
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,750
There's really nothing here?

641
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,690
Wait, what do you see?

642
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,430
Okay.

643
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:38,590
Oh,

644
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,550
maybe we explode it.

645
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,970
Okay.

646
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,570
Yeah, try it.

647
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,730
Oh, stand back.

648
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,410
Maybe?

649
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,470
Stand back.

650
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:58,830
Okay.

651
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,590
John, thanks for three bullets.

652
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,650
Yeah, go launch her.

653
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,950
Does she always have a neck bow?

654
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,770
I don't.

655
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,930
She's kind of crazy.

656
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,250
She is a little crazy.

657
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,730
But we appreciate...

658
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:22,750
Oh my god.

659
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,550
Rio.

660
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,390
Rio!

661
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,650
Rio!

662
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,210
Oh my god.

663
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:53,990
Sure.

664
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,170
Red.

665
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,070
Blue.

666
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,030
Green.

667
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:05,930
Yeah...

668
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,210
Yes.

669
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,070
I don't have faith in you, Rio!

670
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,970
What do I... Do I just say blue or do I just say green to tell her to switch?

671
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,010
Alright, she's going nice and slow.

672
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,790
Slow and... I think you can...

673
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,230
Blue.

674
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,570
Red.

675
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,870
Okay, some are wobbly and if they're wobbly I have to tell her to get off too.

676
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,090
Blue.

677
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:42,830
Blue!

678
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,170
Oh my god.

679
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,490
Green!

680
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,210
Oh my god.

681
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:52,710
Okay.

682
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,450
Blue!

683
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,290
Wait, how do I... Here?

684
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,210
Red.

685
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,760
Blue.

686
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,900
Four months!

687
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,260
I hope I said your name right.

688
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,420
Sorry if I didn't.

689
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,820
Imagine the amount of happy relationships you could ruin if this game had a co-op multiplayer.

690
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh god, no please.

691
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,160
Let's see.

692
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
So we're going to...

693
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,980
Go to Area A.

694
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,560
I...

695
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,140
What are you supposed to do there?

696
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,480
I don't actually get it.

697
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,620
Oh, tongue twister.

698
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,120
Stop!

699
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,880
Oh, too late.

700
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,020
It's okay, maybe.

701
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,120
I should have probably saved after that one guy, huh?

702
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,020
I'm sorry!

703
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:14,760
Okay.

704
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,620
Is that one wobbly?

705
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,080
Blue!

706
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,040
Blue!

707
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,160
Blue!

708
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,570
Does she get hurt when she does this?

709
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,250
Tongue twisters.

710
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,830
How do I do the tongue twisters again?

711
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,230
Let's see.

712
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,010
Oh shoot, I forgot to pull it up on my phone.

713
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,770
Oh, she sells.

714
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,410
She sells.

715
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,150
Yeah.

716
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:51,790
Yes.

717
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,850
Oh my god, life.

718
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,930
Lying tongue twister.

719
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,490
Pick up six pick up sticks quickly.

720
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,530
Okay, where are they?

721
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,050
Oh my god.

722
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,050
Oh no, I'm not ready.

723
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,670
Please, no real, please no.

724
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,590
No!

725
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,730
Okay, okay, that one's not bad.

726
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,330
Okay, I got it, I got it.

727
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,870
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

728
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,770
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

729
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,430
Okay, okay, I got, I got the, I got the guide.

730
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,210
Oh no, I never do this one right.

731
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,270
I never do this one right.

732
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:35,850
Oh gosh.

733
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,530
Okay.

734
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,550
Ah!

735
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,010
I never get that one.

736
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,170
I don't know why.

737
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,210
She sells.

738
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,550
She sells.

739
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,390
Yes.

740
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,350
And I didn't get the beginning wrong.

741
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,670
I said I saw Esau kissing Kate.

742
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:11,590
Okay.

743
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,610
Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran.

744
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,550
Okay.

745
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,190
We did this one.

746
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,630
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

747
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,690
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

748
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,150
Yeah.

749
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,830
Please no Esau, I saw Esau.

750
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,510
Ah!

751
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,570
A woodchuck could chuck wood.

752
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,650
A woodchuck would chuck as much as he could chuck if a woodchuck could.

753
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,310
Good.

754
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,550
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

755
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,130
A woodchuck would chuck as much as it could chuck if a woodchuck could.

756
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:58,530
Yay!

757
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,710
Oh my gosh.

758
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,350
Let's do it one more time and then we'll go heal.

759
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,430
Or, I'm sorry, save.

760
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,130
She sells.

761
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,590
It's impressive.

762
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,510
Yes.

763
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,450
Thank you.

764
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,450
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

765
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,310
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

766
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,790
Okay.

767
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,250
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

768
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,690
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

769
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,370
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy, was it?

770
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,570
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

771
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,730
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

772
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,370
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

773
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:48,670
Yeah!

774
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,930
I'm gonna go slow with this one.

775
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,850
I saw Esaw kissing Kate.

776
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,890
Kate saw I saw Esaw.

777
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,350
Esaw saw that I saw Kate.

778
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,430
And Kate saw I saw Esaw.

779
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,110
Ever!

780
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:15,710
I never get it!

781
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,230
It never registers that one.

782
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,510
She sells.

783
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:25,470
Yes.

784
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,610
Maybe I have to go fast maybe.

785
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,830
I saw she saw she saw saw.

786
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,030
I saw I saw I saw I saw.

787
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,630
You saw I saw you saw.

788
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,610
Kate saw I saw I saw.

789
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:37,590
What was it?

790
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,650
Around the rugged rocks, the rascal ran.

791
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,110
Oh, I forgot to say the ragged rascal.

792
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:46,890
Oops.

793
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,330
She sells her seashells to the shore.

794
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,070
Thanks Phoenix!

795
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,590
Thanks for nine months.

796
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,930
She sells seashells on the seashore.

797
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,290
Seashells she sells are seashells she is sure.

798
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:06,070
That one's hard.

799
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,490
Yeah, don't say it.

800
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,370
Betty Batter had some butter, but she said this butter's bitter.

801
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,450
If I bake this bitter butter, then it would make my batter bitter.

802
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,990
Yeah, I got this one.

803
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,190
Betty Batter had some butter, but she said this butter's bitter.

804
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,850
If I bake this bitter butter, then it would make my batter bitter.

805
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:28,050
Yeah!

806
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,410
Oh, thank goodness.

807
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,210
In British.

808
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,850
Go to Area C.

809
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,190
Wait, what?

810
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,430
Oh.

811
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,150
Go to Area B.

812
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:50,890
No, no, no!

813
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,890
Go to Area...

814
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,250
Stop!

815
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,690
Walking real!

816
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,030
Full health, I know.

817
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,810
Not for long though.

818
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,120
Blue.

819
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,740
Red.

820
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:20,820
Red.

821
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,560
Yes.

822
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,680
Okay, so she doesn't just walk off the ledge.

823
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,440
That's good to know.

824
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,740
Real walk.

825
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,520
Forward.

826
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,910
Blue.

827
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,230
Green.

828
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,230
Yeah, she makes such a stink about it until...

829
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:49,950
Blue.

830
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:51,530
Blue.

831
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,220
So stupid.

832
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,360
She's such a joke.

833
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,860
I saw PTSD for being stuck on this part for days.

834
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,340
This is where many people end up quitting the game to preserve their sanity.

835
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,480
Wait, what do you mean by that, Nicholas?

836
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,220
Like this...

837
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,340
Go to Area B.

838
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,200
What?

839
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,040
I'm not saying Area A.

840
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,640
What is the... What am I supposed to do here?

841
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,980
But actually though... Because when we get to that part...

842
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,620
There's only red... Oh yeah, only red and green.

843
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,440
Can she jump that far?

844
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,220
I doubt it.

845
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,300
Jump jump pose.

846
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,740
Green then red.

847
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,740
Blue.

848
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,840
You can jump that far?

849
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,740
Okay, we'll try it.

850
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,220
Red.

851
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:57,580
Red.

852
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,860
Forward.

853
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,640
Forward.

854
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,100
Forward.

855
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:14,650
Blue.

856
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,010
Okay, let's try.

857
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,630
Green.

858
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,030
I have to be careful with blue.

859
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,910
I think maybe my mic is like...

860
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,250
Blue.

861
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:27,870
Blue.

862
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:29,810
Blue.

863
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,670
You dumbass bitch!

864
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,090
God dammit Rio!

865
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:34,870
Blue!

866
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:35,610
Blue!

867
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,380
We were so close the first time.

868
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,980
Go to Area A.

869
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,200
Run.

870
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,060
Blue.

871
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,460
I don't think left right works because she told me to say the colors.

872
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,820
Actually though, I did try saying right.

873
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,800
Or she thought I said right at one point.

874
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,640
But it's her left and her right.

875
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,160
Blue.

876
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,280
Maybe she's color blind.

877
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:20,760
Red.

878
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:22,640
Red.

879
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,360
Walk.

880
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,640
She might be color blind.

881
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,140
Blue.

882
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,280
Nice.

883
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,720
That was smooth.

884
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,460
Green.

885
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,520
Nice.

886
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,780
Blue.

887
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,190
Green.

888
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,740
Red.

889
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,040
She really does make it.

890
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,880
Holy moly!

891
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,660
Oh my gosh we made it!

892
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,220
Oh what was that?

893
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,100
What was that?

894
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,040
No there's more?

895
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,640
There's more and there's steam!

896
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,520
Oh my gosh.

897
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,360
No!

898
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,720
No!

899
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,280
Green.

900
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,120
Oh my gosh.

901
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,900
Are you kidding me?

902
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:38,820
Blue.

903
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,240
Blue!

904
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,280
Oh my gosh.

905
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,200
Lee is real.

906
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,960
Please walk.

907
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,360
Go to Area D.

908
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,040
Maybe there's something down there that like...

909
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,880
Maybe we can just skip all of this, right?

910
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,700
We go through Area D and we skip all this funny business.

911
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,760
It's funny every time.

912
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,320
Welcome back to Goose Dumpster!

913
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,340
There's a health kit though.

914
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:19,820
It was worth.

915
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:23,800
Hello again.

916
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,080
Minto.

917
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,500
If Rio was walking through a park it was a different thing.

918
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:26,980
No!

919
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,600
Rio wouldn't do anything.

920
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,440
Run.

921
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,380
Oh my god.

922
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,380
Oh no, this is gonna be so hellish.

923
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,540
This really is Goose Dumps Room 2.0.

924
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,260
No, please god.

925
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,780
Please god, please.

926
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,140
Please, please.

927
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,240
Please, please, please.

928
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,340
Don't do this Rio.

929
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,820
Green.

930
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,640
Please, please, please.

931
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,880
I'm gonna...

932
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,980
It's about to go, yeah.

933
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:07,820
Walk.

934
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,220
Go to Area C.

935
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,180
I think I waited too long on that one.

936
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,380
I did say blue though.

937
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,620
I did say blue.

938
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,900
Rio, I'm going to murder you.

939
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,100
Why can't she jump forward?

940
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,960
Green.

941
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,940
Walk.

942
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:11,070
What if I say...

943
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:11,550
Red.

944
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,870
Blue.

945
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,750
Stop.

946
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,010
Ok, hold on.

947
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,050
Ok.

948
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,930
And then the next one.

949
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:35,830
This one.

950
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:36,870
Walk.

951
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,590
Stop.

952
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,810
Walk.

953
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,100
Green.

954
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,040
We were doing so well man.

955
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,260
We were doing so well.

956
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,720
It's all Rio's fault.

957
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,310
She sells.

958
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,490
Rio's family guy death pose.

959
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:37,330
The fact she doesn't even attempt to like... You know how most people...

960
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,290
Yes.

961
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:45,410
Most people like put their arms out when they're trying to protect their bodies, you know.

962
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,890
But she just falls flat on her face.

963
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,810
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

964
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:56,210
She just falls like a two year old.

965
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,950
She sells.

966
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,390
She sells seashells on the seashore.

967
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:10,790
Seashells she sells are our seashells she is sure.

968
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:12,330
Ok.

969
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:14,410
No song.

970
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,030
No song.

971
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:18,650
Ok.

972
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,910
Ok.

973
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,830
If I bake this bitter butter it would make my batter bitter.

974
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:34,070
Yeah.

975
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,910
I'm a rap queen.

976
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,750
You're welcome.

977
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:42,810
Ok yeah you did.

978
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:43,090
Ok.

979
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:44,390
What is it?

980
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,590
Ok.

981
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,350
Go to area C.

982
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,850
We were doing so well this last one.

983
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,150
I'm so sad.

984
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,210
I'm so sad.

985
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,310
After two hours we couldn't get past this.

986
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,810
No.

987
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:03,850
I believe in us.

988
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,150
I believe in us.

989
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,500
Green.

990
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:16,940
Nice.

991
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:20,790
Stop.

992
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:23,890
Blue.

993
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:23,950
Blue.

994
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:29,760
Walk.

995
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,460
Walk faster.

996
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,560
You're scaring me.

997
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,600
You're making me nervous.

998
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,960
Red.

999
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,140
Stop.

1000
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,480
Blue.

1001
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,650
Oh my god.

1002
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,550
Which one is the... Ok so it's that one first.

1003
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,070
Walk.

1004
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:56,130
Walk.

1005
00:55:59,230 --> 00:55:59,870
Stop.

1006
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:02,290
Walk.

1007
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,880
Your little toes got burnt Rio.

1008
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
Did your toes get burnt Rio?

1009
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,460
Do you need someone to kiss them?

1010
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,800
Do you need someone to suckle them?

1011
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,500
Do you need someone to make them feel better Rio?

1012
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,380
Go to area C.

1013
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:28,860
Stop.

1014
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,850
I'm already... It's not even an hour into the stream guys.

1015
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,330
I'm so... It's so over for me.

1016
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,230
Green.

1017
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,030
It's so over for me.

1018
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:56,610
Blue.

1019
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,890
Walk faster please.

1020
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,550
You're scaring me.

1021
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,650
Stop.

1022
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:12,570
Walk.

1023
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:16,910
Stop.

1024
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,960
Area C.

1025
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,160
Run.

1026
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,640
What was she trying to say about the ceiling?

1027
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,200
Use your eyes Rio.

1028
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,680
It's not my fault.

1029
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,120
What do you mean guide you properly?

1030
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,300
We found the room.

1031
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,020
Green.

1032
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,720
We really did.

1033
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,400
I really... I really cursed myself with that didn't I?

1034
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,620
Blue.

1035
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:00,860
Stop.

1036
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:03,940
Walk.

1037
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,540
Yep.

1038
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,780
Please walk faster.

1039
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,620
You're scaring me.

1040
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,000
Stop.

1041
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:18,840
Walk.

1042
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,900
Stop.

1043
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,540
Walk.

1044
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,900
Green.

1045
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,640
Red.

1046
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:46,730
Stop.

1047
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,870
These ones are like at the same time.

1048
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:01,410
Blue.

1049
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,790
Walk.

1050
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,450
Yeah.

1051
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:11,330
Crouch?

1052
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:11,890
I don't know.

1053
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:12,850
What do you want me to do?

1054
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:16,790
Green.

1055
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:19,590
Walk.

1056
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,060
Stop.

1057
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:28,840
Stop.

1058
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,000
Let's see how this one works.

1059
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:34,930
Walk.

1060
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:40,880
Stop.

1061
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,480
No we're not going to make it.

1062
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,340
Walk.

1063
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,240
Red.

1064
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,920
Oh shit.

1065
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,460
I can't tell by depth perception you guys.

1066
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,260
I think it's green.

1067
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,280
I think we go all the way to the end of the green and then we... green.

1068
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:58,640
Walk.

1069
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,500
Red.

1070
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:05,720
Red.

1071
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,180
Walk.

1072
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:13,620
Blue.

1073
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,080
Oh my god girl.

1074
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,240
Take a step forward.

1075
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,480
What's wrong with you?

1076
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:22,580
You!

1077
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,300
Oh my god!

1078
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,800
Oh my god!

1079
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:40,920
I can't believe she just...imagine if we had fallen off right there on the final one.

1080
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,040
I broke her.

1081
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,040
This girl is unbelievable.

1082
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:51,240
We did it!

1083
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,180
I can't go back now.

1084
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,260
Let's move on.

1085
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,980
You chose...when she makes her own decision she gets mad at me.

1086
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,180
She's like I can't do it now.

1087
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,020
I can't go back now.

1088
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,280
Let's see.

1089
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,520
How many...okay we have two heal capsules.

1090
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,900
And two launcher grenades.

1091
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,480
Let's go to waiting room.

1092
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,400
There might be a save in there.

1093
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,560
I know we'll probably get ambushed though, sadly.

1094
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,160
I don't want to die.

1095
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,680
Please don't make me go through it again.

1096
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,340
Please game.

1097
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,440
Be kind game.

1098
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:42,140
Please.

1099
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,320
Please.

1100
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,600
Please be kind game.

1101
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,880
I'm scared.

1102
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,820
I'm scared.

1103
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,870
Wait, who is that?

1104
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,930
Wait, is that the reporter you were trying to find before?

1105
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:17,250
Yeah, because she was trying to find a reporter lady.

1106
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,370
If only she was alive.

1107
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,130
She's human.

1108
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,910
Hello.

1109
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,410
Okay.

1110
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:29,970
August 8th.

1111
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:31,090
Oh, I found it.

1112
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:32,850
I found it.

1113
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,370
Red disc.

1114
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:37,250
No, no.

1115
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,730
Oh my god.

1116
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,510
Blue star.

1117
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:45,750
No, that's...

1118
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,930
Red disc with blue star.

1119
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,370
No, no, no.

1120
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,250
No, no, no.

1121
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,070
Red disc, blue star.

1122
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:05,310
Blue star, red disc.

1123
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,970
She keeps picking up the same one over and over again.

1124
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,090
No.

1125
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,290
Mario, stop that one.

1126
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,990
Blue star, red box.

1127
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,250
Red cover.

1128
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,690
Red cover, blue star.

1129
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,810
All she hears is one thing.

1130
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:45,370
She only...

1131
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:48,070
Red with blue star.

1132
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:57,290
Oh my god.

1133
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,490
Goodness gracious.

1134
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,710
This is so fun.

1135
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,430
Mario, you have no business.

1136
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,470
It's right here.

1137
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:31,430
I'm going to eat while she watches.

1138
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,090
Hello, manager.

1139
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:47,310
Isn't that what we...

1140
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,230
Yeah.

1141
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:56,330
Wait, so you are literally here as a normal person?

1142
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,710
The blue ball.

1143
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:06,490
What?

1144
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,430
I thought I left out when the same reporter came aboard to cover the opening ceremony.

1145
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,470
I figured I could ask her.

1146
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,170
Why would she know?

1147
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,250
She was just...

1148
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:32,810
Now you know how I feel working with you.

1149
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:36,870
The blurb.

1150
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:42,830
Your mom.

1151
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,010
Are you serious?

1152
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:55,950
No way.

1153
01:05:59,110 --> 01:05:59,830
Captain.

1154
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,130
I don't know.

1155
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,270
I don't know.

1156
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:07,630
Why don't you think of it?

1157
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:12,630
I can't believe that she actually has a response for your mom.

1158
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,850
I can't believe it.

1159
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:16,810
Naomi.

1160
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,990
And it's not giving me the option...

1161
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:25,810
It's not giving me the option to go through my list of people.

1162
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,810
Does anybody else know?

1163
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:29,750
Naomi.

1164
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:31,590
I know.

1165
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,010
Gustav.

1166
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,090
Oh, what was the friend?

1167
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:41,730
Gustav.

1168
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,430
Who?

1169
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,590
Who is Alan Honda?

1170
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:48,710
Jonathan.

1171
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:52,530
No.

1172
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:52,970
Jonathan.

1173
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,010
Am I going to get a game over with this?

1174
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:58,670
I'm scared.

1175
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:01,850
I'm actually scared.

1176
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,070
I don't want to get a game over.

1177
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,150
I don't know.

1178
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:12,950
I don't know.

1179
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:13,670
I don't know.

1180
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:13,730
I don't know.

1181
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,490
Look it up in a walkthrough.

1182
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,650
Everybody is saying the worst things ever.

1183
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,250
Hold on.

1184
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:25,590
I'm going to the walkthrough.

1185
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,290
I'm scared.

1186
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,830
I have no idea and it's not giving me an option to...

1187
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:30,330
Hold on.

1188
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:31,170
Walkthrough.

1189
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,170
Equipment.

1190
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:34,810
Where are we?

1191
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:35,550
A guest room.

1192
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:36,530
No, we are past that.

1193
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,530
We are past the restroom, the moon suite.

1194
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,490
We are in the waiting room.

1195
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,430
The waiting room.

1196
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:44,370
The waiting room.

1197
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:46,950
Exhibit room.

1198
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:47,610
What is that?

1199
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:48,070
Laboratory.

1200
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:48,930
We are not there yet.

1201
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:49,650
Waiting room.

1202
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:51,490
Who should we ask?

1203
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,330
Tell her the name of anyone you've met and she will give you a response.

1204
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:59,450
But the correct reply is Gino.

1205
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:01,850
Who the hell is Gino?

1206
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,230
Gino.

1207
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:12,770
Who?

1208
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,750
Glad we are all in agreement.

1209
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,810
Oh yeah baby.

1210
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:28,150
Yes.

1211
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:33,230
Yes.

1212
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:37,770
The blue ball.

1213
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,030
Please talk.

1214
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,990
She is being so edgy.

1215
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,430
What is it?

1216
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:48,950
Then tell me.

1217
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:50,570
Tell me.

1218
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:06,090
You got it dude.

1219
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:09,930
Alright, our girlfriend.

1220
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,310
Yeah, we got to get Naomi.

1221
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,570
Oh my goodness, there is a save.

1222
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,270
Save point.

1223
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,030
Oh, it feels so good.

1224
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:22,090
Oh my gosh, it feels so good.

1225
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,190
Yeah, yeah baby.

1226
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:28,190
So she did not tell us what the blue ball is.

1227
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:33,370
She did not tell us about the blue ball, but that's okay.

1228
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:33,570
Yay!

1229
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,670
Oh joyous day indeed.

1230
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,990
I feel such relief.

1231
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,230
Right now you guys don't even know.

1232
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:47,490
Alright, let's check.

1233
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,610
We got a lot of stuff in here.

1234
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,010
Let's check.

1235
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,210
Vending machine.

1236
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:56,230
What the?

1237
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,890
The vending machine.

1238
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:58,670
Okay.

1239
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,480
That was weird.

1240
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,980
Oh gosh, there is so much here.

1241
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:07,940
Plant.

1242
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,060
Leafy house plant.

1243
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,160
Check under couch.

1244
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:16,640
Yeah.

1245
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,680
Rio is not our girlfriend.

1246
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,560
I don't want Rio to be our girlfriend.

1247
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,100
I don't want this.

1248
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,340
Check corpse.

1249
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:27,720
Yeah.

1250
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,060
Check Helen's corpse.

1251
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,680
Check other corpse.

1252
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,640
Logan, thank you so much for the five gifts.

1253
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,920
Thank you.

1254
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,920
Check camera.

1255
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,860
Yeah, what else would I be talking about?

1256
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,200
Seriously?

1257
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:54,320
Really?

1258
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,400
Check video camera.

1259
01:10:59,080 --> 01:10:59,500
Yeah.

1260
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,040
We got another chip.

1261
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:05,200
Nice.

1262
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,240
Nice, nice, nice.

1263
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,960
Are we sure there is nothing in this corpse?

1264
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,260
How am I supposed to name this one?

1265
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,260
Check vending machine.

1266
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,640
Check left side of vending machine.

1267
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,580
Mr. Obese, thanks for the ten gifts.

1268
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,440
Check yellow corpse.

1269
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,860
I thought she went...

1270
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:44,500
Before she finished, I thought she meant like...

1271
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,240
His guts went everywhere.

1272
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,060
Damn.

1273
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,860
Check CDs.

1274
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,820
It's just news footage.

1275
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,100
We won't be needing this disc.

1276
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:53,420
What?

1277
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,620
Year is 2030 and they are using discs?

1278
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:58,780
Crazy.

1279
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,340
What should I say for the vending machine?

1280
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:04,760
CDs.

1281
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:07,620
Stop.

1282
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,040
Oh yeah.

1283
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,380
Check left vending machine slot.

1284
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,040
It's the same as the one in the security room.

1285
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,500
Oh yeah, let's just say...

1286
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,980
Vending machine slots.

1287
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,200
Stop, please.

1288
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,760
I don't know how to...

1289
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,540
That was like literally the beginning of the game.

1290
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,560
It's not a coin slot.

1291
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:42,620
Tray?

1292
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,200
Oh yeah.

1293
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,420
Check vending machine tray.

1294
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,020
It's the same as the one in the security room.

1295
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,660
Oh dispenser.

1296
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,180
Dispenser.

1297
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:54,920
You guys are genius.

1298
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,680
Check left dispenser.

1299
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,720
Yundoki did an amazing job no matter what.

1300
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,040
Oh thank you Magister.

1301
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,680
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1302
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,200
Check right dispenser.

1303
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,300
Useless.

1304
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,840
Alrighty.

1305
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,640
We got everything here.

1306
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,540
Check window.

1307
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,340
I don't think there was anything for the vacuum.

1308
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,240
It wasn't highlighted.

1309
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,620
It's round!

1310
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,020
It's round!

1311
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:38,820
Take that!

1312
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,740
Take that non-believers!

1313
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,500
Check table.

1314
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,500
The table.

1315
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,720
We're not even in space.

1316
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,880
Check business center.

1317
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,040
What is a business center?

1318
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,400
Thank you for the good times Minto.

1319
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:08,460
Thanks Lembas!

1320
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,880
Your profile picture is so nostalgic.

1321
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,040
Check printer.

1322
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,260
No.

1323
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,280
Stop.

1324
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:22,520
Go to business center.

1325
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,760
Is it maybe a copier?

1326
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:26,460
Printer?

1327
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:27,860
Copier.

1328
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,700
Check copier.

1329
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,480
Okay, it is copier.

1330
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,300
Check right copier.

1331
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:38,980
We got it.

1332
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:39,960
Oh look.

1333
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,140
There is a document in it.

1334
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,480
Secrets?

1335
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,280
Read a document.

1336
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,760
Which copier do you mean?

1337
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,700
Take document.

1338
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,320
Yep, it's just ordinary everyday copier paper.

1339
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:59,100
Uncertified hamster!

1340
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,340
Happy birthday!

1341
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,480
Hoping you will survive Gustav's torture room part 3.

1342
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,120
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1343
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,900
What do you mean?

1344
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,860
Answer the question before I sing you happy birthday!

1345
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,040
Hamster!

1346
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,100
Open tray.

1347
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,720
What am I to open?

1348
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,900
No, I don't think that works.

1349
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,960
Check document.

1350
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,320
Yep, it's just ordinary everyday copier paper.

1351
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,580
Make a copy gives you a new command.

1352
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:28,820
Really?

1353
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,140
Make a copy.

1354
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,640
Which copier do you mean?

1355
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,040
Make a copy right copier.

1356
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,160
Make a copy?

1357
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,020
Ok, I'll press the button.

1358
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,000
She's going to do it.

1359
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,600
Hey, something came out.

1360
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,760
Jump this red light.

1361
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:50,280
Wait, what?

1362
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:50,700
Jump?

1363
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,620
Happy birthday to you!

1364
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,040
Happy birthday to you!

1365
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,360
Happy birthday Uncertified Hamster!

1366
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,700
Happy birthday to you!

1367
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,300
Happy birthday!

1368
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:11,040
I was referring to Rio always thinking you said stop when you said Gustavo.

1369
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,420
Gotcha!

1370
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,560
Out of service.

1371
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:18,780
Midsize copier.

1372
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,940
Copy fax and TV functions.

1373
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,500
What is that thing on the right?

1374
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,220
Check phone.

1375
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1376
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,480
Stop.

1377
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,980
Business center.

1378
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,020
What is it?

1379
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,940
Alarm?

1380
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,280
Alarm.

1381
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:43,980
Well, I still have my health.

1382
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,680
Looks like an ATM, I don't think.

1383
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,760
That's... I don't know.

1384
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:51,080
Looks like a key...

1385
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,560
Key card reader.

1386
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:54,720
Do you mean that?

1387
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,820
Key box!

1388
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,620
Check key box.

1389
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,440
The observatory restaurant's key is in here, but this is locked.

1390
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,680
Oh...

1391
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:06,540
It is locked.

1392
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,420
I got it.

1393
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:23,820
That's me playing the game.

1394
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,880
Not Honkai!

1395
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:32,580
What is that?

1396
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,220
Can you open it, Operator?

1397
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,100
Joe Mama.

1398
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,080
Please state your full name.

1399
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,360
It has to be the full name, remember?

1400
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,600
I wish we had a...

1401
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,180
a relationship chart.

1402
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,520
Who is it supposed to be?

1403
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,640
I don't think it's Jonathan or Gustav.

1404
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,800
I sure hope it's not Gustav.

1405
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,560
Control section.

1406
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:15,660
I don't think it's them.

1407
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,540
I'm gonna actually...

1408
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,020
I'm gonna look this up.

1409
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:20,760
I'm sorry, guys.

1410
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,060
If it's any people, I don't know names.

1411
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:24,720
Oh my gosh!

1412
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,320
Wait, it is Jonathan Turner!

1413
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:27,900
Wait.

1414
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:27,960
Wait.

1415
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,960
You have to...

1416
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,340
The guide says basically you have to know the manager's name to get in, which is the correct answer.

1417
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,120
Thanks to looking in the employee IDs is Jon...

1418
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,280
Where does it say that?

1419
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,280
Did I miss it?

1420
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:46,870
It doesn't...

1421
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:49,430
It literally doesn't say that at all.

1422
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:54,110
It doesn't say that he is the manager.

1423
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:55,350
Anywhere.

1424
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,670
Is he actually watching me?

1425
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,070
Key box.

1426
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:10,990
Control system document.

1427
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:13,090
Wait, where?

1428
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,890
Control system document.

1429
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,480
Night vision...

1430
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,080
I guess the administrator is there.

1431
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:29,100
I guess that.

1432
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:31,840
Key...

1433
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,880
Sorry, I forgot what it was called.

1434
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,440
I forgot what it was called.

1435
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,000
Nemotaku!

1436
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,300
Welcome to Rainbow Chef.

1437
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:39,980
Thank you.

1438
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,000
Let's do it.

1439
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,100
Jonathan...

1440
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,780
Stop talking.

1441
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,840
Jonathan Turner.

1442
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:05,600
Can you send a greeting to the Wawa Nation?

1443
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,680
Let's go Wawa Nation!

1444
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,880
Were we trying to?

1445
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,140
Save point.

1446
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,180
Were we trying to get in there?

1447
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:22,760
I don't know.

1448
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,580
We haven't...

1449
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,380
Spoilers.

1450
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,600
I eat while it saves.

1451
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,120
Oh no!

1452
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,680
I don't remember why I saved on a previous one before, but...

1453
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,160
Whoopsie.

1454
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:52,920
Oopsie.

1455
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:54,000
Alright.

1456
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,060
We have looked at everything in here.

1457
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,580
So...

1458
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,100
Hallway.

1459
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:06,520
OK.

1460
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:16,670
If I get a bad ending, it's what she deserves.

1461
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,030
I love...

1462
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,290
What did I say?

1463
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:23,130
What did I say?

1464
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:24,290
Real.

1465
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:31,150
But she understood that somehow.

1466
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,210
Oh, we fought in here before.

1467
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:39,670
What if I...

1468
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:40,330
Elevator.

1469
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:43,710
We got ambushed in here before, right?

1470
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,990
And we are getting ambushed again!

1471
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,670
No way!

1472
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:52,870
Niki!

1473
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:56,490
Head.

1474
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,410
Seriously?

1475
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,830
Flee.

1476
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,360
Flee.

1477
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:31,850
Guard.

1478
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:32,790
Strafe.

1479
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:34,270
Flee.

1480
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,670
Where is it?

1481
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:38,470
Flee.

1482
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,880
Oh my god, still?

1483
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:44,660
Enemy one.

1484
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,560
How the hell?

1485
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,000
Flee.

1486
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,260
Girl, you need to run further.

1487
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:52,840
Seriously.

1488
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:53,300
Flee.

1489
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:54,720
Flee.

1490
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,960
This thing is so annoying.

1491
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:37,500
Flee.

1492
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,460
Flee.

1493
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,320
Enemy one.

1494
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,640
Enemy one.

1495
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,160
Enemy one.

1496
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,300
Flee.

1497
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:46,400
Flee.

1498
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,060
Flee.

1499
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,080
Eye.

1500
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,220
Enemy one.

1501
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:00,780
Flee.

1502
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,260
Oh, she's reloading.

1503
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:30,250
Flee.

1504
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:31,750
Eye.

1505
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:31,950
Oh

1506
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:41,990
my god, when it's going invisible, it can't get shot at.

1507
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:42,930
Really?

1508
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:43,970
Flee.

1509
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:45,730
Oopsie.

1510
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:46,830
Eye.

1511
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,050
Eye.

1512
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:48,430
Eye.

1513
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:49,390
Flee.

1514
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,370
Eye.

1515
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,750
Eye.

1516
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:54,950
Eye.

1517
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,850
Oh my gosh.

1518
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,350
Flee.

1519
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,030
Flee.

1520
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:02,470
Oh.

1521
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:03,590
Flee.

1522
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:04,890
Flee.

1523
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:44,830
Flee.

1524
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,190
Flee.

1525
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:52,990
Why didn't you run?

1526
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:54,190
You said yes.

1527
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,500
You said yes, why didn't you run?

1528
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,460
Oh my gosh, at least we got through it.

1529
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,160
I didn't want to restart.

1530
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,160
Even though I used a health, that's okay.

1531
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,980
We still have two, I think, left?

1532
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,540
Wait.

1533
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:17,580
Yeah.

1534
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,020
Elevator hall.

1535
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,880
She did jump.

1536
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:30,340
I wonder if I could've jumped to avoid the attack.

1537
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:33,940
Okay.

1538
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:35,500
Okay.

1539
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,600
What does sexy pose do?

1540
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,380
Do a sexy pose.

1541
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,660
That's what it does.

1542
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,720
Observatory restaurant.

1543
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,920
What's gunslinger style?

1544
01:26:58,980 --> 01:26:59,600
Is that a real thing?

1545
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,140
Does that work on the enemies?

1546
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,540
It could.

1547
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,280
Oh my gosh, wait.

1548
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:14,800
This looks highly unstable for someone who breathes oxygen.

1549
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,840
I do.

1550
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:21,900
Yes.

1551
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,580
This is where the party was.

1552
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:29,700
Yeah.

1553
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,260
Okay.

1554
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,140
How did I get to where I was?

1555
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,100
I'll come.

1556
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,530
And get ambushed.

1557
01:27:57,650 --> 01:27:58,810
Oh, there's a save point.

1558
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:02,030
Save point.

1559
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:04,930
No, no.

1560
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:06,270
What are you talking about?

1561
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,210
Look at what?

1562
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:08,510
The fire?

1563
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,570
Seriously?

1564
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:32,070
That didn't sound good.

1565
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:33,410
What was that?

1566
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,370
Yeah, what was that?

1567
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:35,870
No, no, no.

1568
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,290
No, we're gonna...

1569
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:39,610
We're gonna get ambushed.

1570
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:41,030
I didn't get to save.

1571
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:45,270
No, please.

1572
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:46,950
Ryo, don't investigate.

1573
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,090
Please let me...

1574
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:51,970
Please let me save first.

1575
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:53,710
Ryo, no.

1576
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:56,050
Ryo, don't do it.

1577
01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:57,730
Save.

1578
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:02,230
Save point.

1579
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:05,450
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1580
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:05,950
Run.

1581
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:06,710
Run.

1582
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:10,990
Maybe it was...

1583
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:11,730
I feel like...

1584
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:12,030
Well, no.

1585
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:15,690
I was gonna say, I feel like they don't usually give save points in rooms where you get attacked.

1586
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:16,610
But that is...

1587
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:18,510
100% false.

1588
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:23,030
100% false.

1589
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,050
Hot dog.

1590
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:32,010
I think the combat has some good ideas.

1591
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,490
Like the use of weak points.

1592
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:35,450
It's just ruined by the voice activated controls.

1593
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:36,710
Yeah, pretty much.

1594
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,230
No,

1595
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:41,660
but like...

1596
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,660
It's also because it's so slow.

1597
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,340
When I'm trying to...

1598
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:46,560
Like...

1599
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,560
Saying dodge doesn't...

1600
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,240
I would have to like time everything so perfectly.

1601
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,780
To be able to dodge stuff.

1602
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,540
Because I have to do the input and then she has to listen to me.

1603
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,700
And then do it.

1604
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,340
It's like a three-step system.

1605
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,260
Rather than just if I were to press a button and dodge.

1606
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:04,380
It's like...

1607
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:04,740
I would...

1608
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:07,000
I have to think literally three steps ahead.

1609
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,640
Of what the enemy is doing.

1610
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:10,020
To...

1611
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,140
To be able to say dodge.

1612
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,080
And she actually register it.

1613
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:15,120
And it actually works.

1614
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,920
And the enemy actually properly did the attack that I was thinking of.

1615
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,840
This is how chat feels back saying sometimes.

1616
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,200
No, I don't think so.

1617
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:26,600
VIP seat one.

1618
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:31,920
Nevermind.

1619
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,740
Can we blast it?

1620
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,280
Blast it.

1621
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,500
Blast it.

1622
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,480
Blast it.

1623
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:41,700
With the grenade.

1624
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,120
You have the grenade.

1625
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:45,380
You literally...

1626
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:45,920
You picked that up.

1627
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,020
Machine gun.

1628
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:48,920
I don't know.

1629
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:50,740
Launcher grenade.

1630
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,260
Launcher grenade.

1631
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,200
Okay.

1632
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,560
Oh my god.

1633
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,680
It's so loud.

1634
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,940
I don't think that's really safe to do in a room that is...

1635
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,440
Look at the glass on the windows.

1636
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,460
It's so scary.

1637
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,880
Oh gosh.

1638
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,200
Oh my god.

1639
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:17,200
Oh my god.

1640
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:18,820
Oh my god.

1641
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,620
VIP seat one.

1642
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,620
This is so scary.

1643
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,360
Anything here?

1644
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,040
Okay.

1645
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,380
Okay.

1646
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,780
VIP seat two.

1647
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,000
She's listening so well.

1648
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:38,700
A chip.

1649
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,400
Chip, chip, chip, chip.

1650
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,760
This game would be a bit better if...

1651
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,860
It would feel a bit better if Rio were like a robot.

1652
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:49,700
Yeah, true.

1653
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,400
True, I do agree.

1654
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:53,760
Everything is better with robots.

1655
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,820
VIP seat three.

1656
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,280
Can you shoot the window?

1657
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,180
Shoot window.

1658
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,380
I guess not.

1659
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,300
Letter.

1660
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:11,660
Yup.

1661
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:12,980
Menu.

1662
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:17,020
Check menu.

1663
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,060
Dirty.

1664
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,480
Check lamp.

1665
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:29,800
The lamp.

1666
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:30,840
Lamp.

1667
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:35,860
Stop.

1668
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,600
VIP seat three.

1669
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,640
What is that?

1670
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:47,120
Flower?

1671
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:47,960
Is it a flower?

1672
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,080
Flower.

1673
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:51,800
Yeah, what is that?

1674
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:52,340
What is that?

1675
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,400
Floor lamp.

1676
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,800
Check floor lamp.

1677
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,240
This is already broken.

1678
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:01,760
We got a new command though.

1679
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,100
It's in...

1680
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:02,760
No, no, no.

1681
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,220
How do I...

1682
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:11,640
Choose to believe she is cursed by a genie and gave up her executive function to gain the power of healing via limb rigs and tongue twisters.

1683
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,120
Check lamp shade.

1684
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,620
Are you talking about that?

1685
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,300
Yeah.

1686
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:23,100
Check inside floor lamp.

1687
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:24,140
That's broken.

1688
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:25,300
No.

1689
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,820
Check floor lamp shade.

1690
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:30,400
Are you talking about that?

1691
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:31,160
Oh no.

1692
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,240
This is like the bed all over again.

1693
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:33,980
Oh my god.

1694
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,540
Look in lamp.

1695
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,540
That's broken.

1696
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:37,920
Oh gosh.

1697
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,460
Top of lamp.

1698
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,840
Wine or champagne.

1699
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,300
It's too dirty to tell what it is.

1700
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,020
Wine or champagne.

1701
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,960
Check inside floor lamp.

1702
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,020
That's broken.

1703
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,020
I don't think I can tip it over.

1704
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,080
I don't think...

1705
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:02,840
Tip over lamp.

1706
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,200
I tried checking the top.

1707
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,280
Check top of floor lamp.

1708
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:13,940
Yeah.

1709
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:14,800
Oh.

1710
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,340
What is she...

1711
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:17,900
Oh.

1712
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,040
Is she breaking it?

1713
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:20,000
Oh.

1714
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:20,880
She broke it?

1715
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:22,900
She really broke it.

1716
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,480
We are in champagne.

1717
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,000
Champagne.

1718
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,380
I'll leave it to you?

1719
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:34,360
Wait.

1720
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,060
Are we...

1721
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,880
Are we giving her sentience?

1722
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,160
No way.

1723
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,280
No.

1724
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,380
You've got grave reflexes.

1725
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,760
I'll leave it to you?

1726
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:48,940
Wait.

1727
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:49,940
What is this?

1728
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:50,540
In battle.

1729
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,900
Is it auto fight?

1730
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,100
No way.

1731
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:56,420
No way.

1732
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:03,280
Oh my gosh.

1733
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,720
Consultation.

1734
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,540
Check what?

1735
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:16,440
Save point.

1736
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,040
The save point.

1737
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:18,540
Okay.

1738
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,040
We'll put her in control and see how it works.

1739
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:21,620
Run.

1740
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:22,400
Yes.

1741
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,020
Spin gun.

1742
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,780
How she can become revolver Rio?

1743
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,810
She can.

1744
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:33,290
She can.

1745
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:36,950
I don't think you can sexy pose in battle.

1746
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,390
The game is flawed clearly.

1747
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:42,330
For denying us that access.

1748
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:46,310
You can see it in the things that they...

1749
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:50,470
The commands that show when is allowed at what time.

1750
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:52,910
I know it's outrageous, right?

1751
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:54,670
Absolutely outrageous.

1752
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,110
Let me direct the game next.

1753
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:01,350
I'll give the people what they want.

1754
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,990
Sexy pose in all battles.

1755
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:08,610
It's an automatic win.

1756
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:12,830
Let's see.

1757
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:14,210
What else is in here?

1758
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:15,130
Oh, VIP.

1759
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:17,790
VIP seat 4.

1760
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:22,790
Run.

1761
01:36:23,870 --> 01:36:24,370
Yes.

1762
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:30,630
Wait, is this also blocked?

1763
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:35,910
Oh no.

1764
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:39,130
We are left...

1765
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:42,490
I don't have enough...

1766
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:44,410
Grenade launchers.

1767
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:47,830
Uh-oh.

1768
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:54,350
We only have one more and we have two panels that it wants us to break.

1769
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:57,350
I feel like the other one is gonna be an ambush.

1770
01:36:57,790 --> 01:36:58,650
I just saved.

1771
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:00,070
So let's do this.

1772
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:01,410
We'll do the other one.

1773
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:03,150
If it's an ambush, I just...

1774
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:05,470
We'll test out the auto battle.

1775
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,490
Or I could die, whichever.

1776
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:09,130
And then we could...

1777
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:12,690
Reload and then try this one.

1778
01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:15,950
Yeah, we'll save scum a little bit.

1779
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:18,090
So...

1780
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:19,310
What was it?

1781
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:20,470
Section 2?

1782
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:21,910
Section 2.

1783
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:25,930
Yeah, let's explore the timeline.

1784
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,170
Yeah, we're gonna...

1785
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:30,110
Big brain time.

1786
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:31,810
It wasn't... Wait, wait, wait.

1787
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:32,550
Panel.

1788
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:33,990
Stop.

1789
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:37,290
How do I get to that panel right there?

1790
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:37,870
Is that...

1791
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:39,830
Chandelier?

1792
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:41,350
Chandelier.

1793
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:44,970
I'm...

1794
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:47,690
Gonna swing...

1795
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:49,710
From the chandelier.

1796
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:52,690
From the chandelier.

1797
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,690
Grenade.

1798
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:58,770
Yeah.

1799
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:01,370
I'm...

1800
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:03,990
Gonna live...

1801
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:06,490
Like tomorrow doesn't exist.

1802
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:10,010
Wait, there's a second panel?

1803
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:14,910
That was the last...

1804
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:15,690
There's more...

1805
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,060
We need 2 more?

1806
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,620
We need 3 more technically.

1807
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,360
How am I supposed to get more?

1808
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,340
Okay, let's check...

1809
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,320
Let's go check section...

1810
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,100
We still have section 3, 1 and 2.

1811
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,180
There might be some in there.

1812
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,020
Section 2.

1813
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:36,800
No way they'd soft lock you.

1814
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,320
No, because we just got 2 more.

1815
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:40,780
Right.

1816
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:44,840
What?

1817
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,880
I don't know.

1818
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,220
What?

1819
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:52,980
Oh my god.

1820
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:53,800
Are you kidding me?

1821
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:01,840
I'll leave it to you.

1822
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:06,730
Look at her go.

1823
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:26,410
She hasn't landed one hit.

1824
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:28,330
Left stomach.

1825
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,060
Nice.

1826
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:41,040
Left stomach.

1827
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:45,740
Run!

1828
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:48,120
Please.

1829
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,250
Left stomach.

1830
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:54,390
Reload.

1831
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,590
I don't think she's very good you guys.

1832
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,670
Left stomach.

1833
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:02,010
Left... Right stomach.

1834
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,970
Right stomach.

1835
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:07,390

1836
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:09,350

Red stomach.

1844
01:40:27,710 --> 01:40:28,890
Oh my god, she's blocked.

1845
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,230
Red stomach.

1846
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:32,410
Please.

1849
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,160
I'll leave it to you.

1850
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:44,460
She's got this.

1851
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:46,500
Maybe not.

1852
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,300
Oh god.

1853
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,040
I'll leave it to you.

1854
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:56,100
Run!

1855
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:07,400

1857
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,020

1858
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:18,080

1874
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:53,150
Flee!

1875
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:56,990
Jump!

1876
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,530

1878
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:02,330
Flee.

1879
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:06,270
That was close.

1880
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:21,290
She does command sometimes, but I'm not even finished talking.

1881
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:23,650
I didn't talk... I didn't say anything.

1882
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:33,470

1901
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:17,330
Oh my gosh, she's reloading.

1902
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:19,830
Mouth!

1903
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:21,530

1914
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:51,090
Oh, stomach!

1915
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,050
Stomach!

1916
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:55,030
Low kick!

1917
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:56,530
Low kick!

1918
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:58,070
Low kick!

1919
01:43:58,730 --> 01:43:59,890
Low kick!

1920
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:02,950
Low kick!

1921
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,880
Oh my god, stomach!

1922
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:15,580
Oh my god, if you die here...

1923
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,040
Stomach!

1924
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:22,520
Stomach!

1925
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,200
Stomach!

1926
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,540
Alright guys...

1927
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,240
Time for some tongue twisters.

1928
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:33,060
Me too!

1929
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:37,520
Wait, what is this?

1930
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,140
Oh, it gave another launcher!

1931
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,460
Launcher!

1932
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,840
We actually had to do that.

1933
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,140
Oh my god.

1934
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,000
Once you lock onto a part you can say shoot.

1935
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,140
That is true, but...

1936
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,200
I needed her to shoot the red stomach.

1937
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:02,320
I did forget about that though, thank you for the reminder.

1938
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,540
But she would shoot the mouth and I needed her to...

1939
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:08,040
Well, I needed her to shoot the mouth and then the stomach.

1940
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,520
And she just wouldn't...

1941
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:12,240
She wouldn't register the stomach.

1942
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,360
She sells.

1943
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,320
She sells.

1944
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,120
Yes.

1945
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,120
Okay, please.

1946
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,120
Okay.

1947
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,660
Wait, oh no, I don't have it up yet.

1948
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,720
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

1949
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:37,340
I don't have it yet.

1950
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:37,920
I don't have it.

1951
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:39,260
Okay, I got it, I got it.

1952
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,020
Okay.

1953
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,060
Fuzzy wuzzy.

1954
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:44,620
Nope.

1955
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,060
I hate this one.

1956
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:55,460
A big black bug bit a big blue bug and the big blue bug bled black blood.

1957
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,360
Yeah.

1958
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:03,800
A peck of pickled peppers.

1959
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:06,440
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

1960
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:11,080
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

1961
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,520
I got it.

1962
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,680
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1963
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,180
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

1964
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:23,800
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

1965
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:25,080
Yeah.

1966
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,920
Thank you.

1967
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,540
Alright, heal.

1968
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:34,860
We're sorry, I'm gonna have to do tongue twisters a couple times.

1969
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:36,280
She sells.

1970
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:38,340
A couple times.

1971
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:40,860
Yes.

1972
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,600
Guys, this is how you heal, isn't it so fun?

1973
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,280
Okay.

1974
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:53,280
Pick up six pick up sticks quickly.

1975
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:54,960
Yeah.

1976
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,580
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

1977
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:02,860
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

1978
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,280
Yeah.

1979
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,100
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

1980
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:10,340
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

1981
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,060
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

1982
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:13,560
Yeah.

1983
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:19,320
A peck of pickled peppers.

1984
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:22,060
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

1985
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:27,020
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

1986
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:28,200
I got it.

1987
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,160
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

1988
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,780
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.

1989
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:39,600
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, how many peppers did Peter Piper pick?

1990
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:40,720
Yeah!

1991
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,040
Okay, two more.

1992
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,280
She sells.

1993
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,240
And then we'll save.

1994
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,120
Yes.

1995
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:58,160
Yes.

1996
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,400
Crazy good.

1997
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:05,340
What?

1998
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:06,300
Is that a new one?

1999
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,380
The boot black brought the boot back.

2000
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,120
What does that mean?

2001
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,100
I don't think we've done that one before.

2002
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:20,280
No!

2003
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:28,280
Blood.

2004
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:32,140
I need to chuck.

2005
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:34,040
That one's really good, I think, for practicing.

2006
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:37,200
Chuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.

2007
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:40,960
A woodchuck would chuck as much as wood a woodchuck could chuck could.

2008
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:47,480
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

2009
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:50,980
A woodchuck would chuck as much as it could chuck if a woodchuck could.

2010
01:48:58,380 --> 01:48:59,660
You're welcome!

2011
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,100
Still picking on Peter.

2012
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:05,760
How were the peppers already pickled when Peter picked them?

2013
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,740
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

2014
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,020
A peck of pickled... What is a peck?

2015
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:15,800
Like a branch?

2016
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:16,980
How are...

2017
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:20,280
How are cucumbers grown?

2018
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,040
He picked them from the store.

2019
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,020
A peck is a volume.

2020
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,500
It's a unit of measure?

2021
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:30,660
It's a bunch?

2022
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:32,260
It's like a pinch of something?

2023
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,400
Oh, the unit of measurement.

2024
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:42,900
Save point.

2025
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,480
I think we're okay.

2026
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:45,620
Run.

2027
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:47,200
I think we're okay.

2028
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:49,360
So that was section two, I think.

2029
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:59,780
Oh gosh, thank goodness there's no Irish wristwatch for this one.

2030
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,160
We'll use our final save part.

2031
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,200
Our final save slot.

2032
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,320
Irish wristwatch.

2033
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,660
Irish wristwatch!

2034
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,100
Irish wristwatch.

2035
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:19,900
See, I can do it.

2036
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:22,820
Alright, section one.

2037
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,340
Yeah, that was section two.

2038
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:27,740
So we need section one and section three.

2039
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:30,560
Oh, there's a heal!

2040
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:33,020
Let's go.

2041
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:37,280
Nice.

2042
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,920
Uh oh, but what about...

2043
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:52,900
What about...

2044
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:57,560
Oh no, how do we get to section...

2045
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:57,920
To the right?

2046
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:00,840
Or like in that area?

2047
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,360
Section four.

2048
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,980
Hospitals in this world must be amazing.

2049
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:13,860
True, I hope not though.

2050
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:15,160
I hope we just find the item.

2051
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:15,820
No!

2052
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,920
Lampy, thanks for the good...

2053
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,500
Fleet.

2054
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,480
Hind legs.

2055
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,220
Front legs.

2056
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:27,340
Nope.

2057
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:28,520
Front leg.

2058
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,100
Left stomach.

2059
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,020
Left stomach.

2060
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,220
Left stomach.

2061
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:36,340
Nope.

2062
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:37,640
Left stomach.

2063
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,200
Enemy two.

2064
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:41,980
Mouth.

2065
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,440
Mouth.

2066
01:51:43,860 --> 01:51:45,020
Mouth.

2067
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:46,680
Stomach.

2068
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:48,300
Mouth.

2069
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,720
Oh, reload.

2070
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,100
Mouth.

2071
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:54,620
Stomach.

2072
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:03,610
Oh my god, wait.

2073
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:04,750
No, no.

2074
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:05,370
Enemy one.

2075
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:06,530
Fleet.

2076
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:12,280
Fleet.

2077
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:14,800
Oh, that was so close.

2078
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:15,560
Enemy two.

2079
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:16,960
Stomach.

2080
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,020
Please, it's so close.

2081
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:21,080
Fleet.

2082
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,860
It's so close.

2083
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:24,760
Stomach.

2084
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:26,920
Stomach.

2085
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:28,660
Stomach.

2086
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:30,380
Stomach.

2087
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,020
Ok, there we go.

2088
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:33,040
Left stomach.

2089
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:33,680
Mouth.

2090
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:34,760
No.

2091
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:47,880
I can't!

2092
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,360
Run.

2093
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,640
The bedroom.

2094
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:04,240
Shoot!

2095
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,120
Left stomach.

2096
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:10,360
Red stomach.

2097
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:12,660
Red stomach.

2098
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:14,520
Red stomach.

2099
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:16,420
Mouth.

2100
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,060
Flee!

2101
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,980
Flee, flee, flee, flee, flee.

2102
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:22,980
There we go, there we go.

2103
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,500
Mouth.

2104
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,420
Red stomach.

2105
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,200
Oh my god!

2106
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:31,220
That was like so clean!

2107
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,480
That was so clean you guys!

2108
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,280
Oh my gosh!

2109
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:36,440
Yeah!

2110
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:39,900
That was so good.

2111
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,600
I don't think we got hurt once.

2112
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:46,240
I don't know how it registers mouth as stomach.

2113
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:47,580
I don't know, I don't know.

2114
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:51,380
Okay, I'm gonna risk it.

2115
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:52,900
Save point.

2116
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,060
Run.

2117
01:53:55,060 --> 01:54:01,380
So I'm going to try for the VIP area and see if there is another grenade launcher in there.

2118
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,680
And also what else is in there.

2119
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:05,400
Because I want to explore.

2120
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:10,380
Risk it for the biscuit, for the biscuit.

2121
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:14,360
Risk it for the biscuit, I want a biscuit.

2122
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,140
That's the one we just did, right?

2123
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,200
Very good.

2124
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:35,280
Crazy how a fight like that is clean, but compared to the rest of the game it was.

2125
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,680
Not a comment on Mint's abilities, but the game is...

2126
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:38,980
I know, right?

2127
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:41,160
VIP seating 4.

2128
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,160
Run.

2129
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,860
Okay, so we'll go do this.

2130
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:54,560
And that's why I saved, because if we softlock ourself, we'll just die somehow and reload.

2131
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,680
I can't go any farther if this thing is here.

2132
01:54:56,980 --> 01:54:58,260
What should I do?

2133
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:02,360
Launcher.

2134
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,040
Okay, leave it up to me.

2135
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:06,300
I hardly know her.

2136
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:10,420
Wow, blasted!

2137
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:11,700
I got blasted.

2138
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,480
Holy loud.

2139
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:15,520
Let's go.

2140
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,040
Run.

2141
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,120
Run.

2142
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:18,980
Yes.

2143
01:55:20,740 --> 01:55:21,940
Or she can't run upstairs.

2144
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:23,100
That's a safety hazard.

2145
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:26,180
You clapped on the monster when it splosh splosh.

2146
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:29,540
Heal capsule!

2147
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:31,140
That's good.

2148
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,160
What else is there?

2149
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:36,540
Oh no.

2150
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,790
Section 3.

2151
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:52,610
Wait, which section was it?

2152
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:53,430
Section 1.

2153
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:55,610
Run.

2154
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,870
Which section was it?

2155
01:55:57,870 --> 01:55:58,430
I can't remember.

2156
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:02,210
This one?

2157
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:03,330
No.

2158
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:07,150
Section 2.

2159
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:13,790
Are we softlocked?

2160
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:15,230
Section 3.

2161
01:56:17,230 --> 01:56:18,530
No, section 4.

2162
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:20,450
Run.

2163
01:56:22,330 --> 01:56:24,470
Okay, heal jelly is important though.

2164
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:25,470
No, wait.

2165
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:26,430
Yeah.

2166
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:31,270
There it is.

2167
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:35,710
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2168
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:36,710
Right eye.

2169
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:38,350
Shoot.

2170
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:40,550
Left eye.

2171
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:42,590
Middle eye.

2172
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,970
Red eye.

2173
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:48,020
Flee.

2174
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:53,780
Why did you run right into it?

2175
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:54,220
Flee.

2176
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,200
Mouth.

2177
01:56:58,620 --> 01:56:59,340
Oh my god, tail.

2178
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:01,140
Mouth.

2179
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,780
Okay.

2180
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:04,120
Hind leg.

2181
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,040
Hind leg.

2182
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:07,680
Front leg.

2183
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:11,600
Actually that works.

2184
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:14,340
Mouth.

2185
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,060
Flee.

2186
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,500
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

2187
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:20,840
Okay.

2188
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,000
Left stomach.

2189
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:33,560
Left stomach.

2190
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:35,340
Left stomach.

2191
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:37,800
Left stomach.

2192
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,900
Where are you going?

2193
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:42,340
Flee.

2194
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,140
Why flee?

2195
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:47,880
Why do you run right into it, you stupid ass.

2196
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:48,920
Left stomach.

2197
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:50,200
Flee.

2198
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:53,240
She jumped and dodged it.

2199
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:53,660
Amazing.

2200
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:55,560
Right stomach.

2201
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:57,660
Left stomach.

2202
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,040
Left stomach.

2203
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,380
Left stomach.

2204
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,940
Left stomach.

2205
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:08,020
Left stomach.

2206
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,240
Left stomach.

2207
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:15,020
Left stomach.

2208
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:19,720
Left stomach.

2209
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:20,700
Left stomach.

2210
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,460
Reload.

2211
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:26,680
Left stomach.

2212
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,560
Left stomach.

2213
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:31,940
Red stomach.

2214
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:34,140
Oh my god, we got it.

2215
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:34,860
Mouth.

2216
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:36,900
Red stomach.

2217
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:44,860
It's tough going.

2218
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:47,460
Yeah it is.

2219
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:50,560
Oh my god.

2220
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:52,400
We got it.

2221
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,200
And now we do tongue twisters.

2222
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,220
We do tongue twisters.

2223
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,300
We save.

2224
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,340
We go.

2225
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:07,440
How many do we have?

2226
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:08,000
Two?

2227
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:08,980
We're in.

2228
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,760
And we got four heal capsules.

2229
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:12,680
She sells.

2230
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:14,140
Yeah!

2231
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:17,620
We are so good right now.

2232
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:18,120
Yes.

2233
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,760
Oh my god, oh my god.

2234
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:23,580
Oh shit.

2235
01:59:25,940 --> 01:59:26,380
Okay.

2236
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:30,280
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

2237
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:32,060
Awesome.

2238
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:38,920
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

2239
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:40,820
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

2240
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:45,600
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

2241
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:47,100
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

2242
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:49,080
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

2243
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,640
Yeah, I'm very good at that one.

2244
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:56,780
A woodchuck could chuck wood.

2245
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,960
A woodchuck would chuck as much as it could if a woodchuck could.

2246
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:02,440
Okay, your turn.

2247
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:09,020
Good.

2248
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:13,880
Why doesn't the second part have the same cadence as the first one?

2249
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:15,140
It drives me insane.

2250
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:17,660
Okay.

2251
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,420
We'll do one more.

2252
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:20,880
She sells.

2253
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:22,740
We'll do one more.

2254
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,880
I am becoming a professional, yeah.

2255
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:25,780
Yes.

2256
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:33,880
Like it should be like a woodchuck could woodchuck chuck.

2257
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:35,240
I don't know.

2258
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:39,340
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

2259
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:41,080
Awesome.

2260
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:44,040
Maybe it's intentional.

2261
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:47,160
On the seashore.

2262
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:50,080
She sells seashells on the seashore.

2263
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:50,100
She is sure.

2264
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:55,940
She sells seashells on the seashore.

2265
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:57,300
She sells.

2266
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,940
She sells our seashells.

2267
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:00,220
She is sure.

2268
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:02,520
I knew it.

2269
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,940
I feel you should suggest this to Henya and Leah.

2270
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,520
Oh my god, you're right.

2271
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,140
She sells.

2272
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,800
I flubbed it up in the second part.

2273
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,520
I knew I did too.

2274
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:17,760
Yes.

2275
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:20,260
What?

2276
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:21,220
No, no, no.

2277
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:21,940
I said yes.

2278
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:23,000
She...

2279
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,280
She sells.

2280
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:26,420
She sounded so sad.

2281
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:29,020
Yes.

2282
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:32,520
Gosh, okay.

2283
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:33,660
Another time.

2284
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:36,360
Okay.

2285
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,500
Pick up six pickup sticks quickly.

2286
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:45,120
That one is just trying to make me say a naughty word.

2287
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:47,280
Fuzzy wuzzy.

2288
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,480
No.

2289
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,600
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

2290
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:58,460
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

2291
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,320
Okay.

2292
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:01,600
Last one.

2293
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:04,780
No.

2294
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:11,680
Okay, I'm gonna try and do it fast.

2295
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:12,340
No.

2296
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:23,560
Ah, never ever.

2297
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:25,960
It does not register that one at all.

2298
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,400
She sells.

2299
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:30,760
That's the guy she...

2300
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,340
She sells.

2301
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,620
I did do it perfect.

2302
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,480
It hates me with that one.

2303
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:37,400
Yes.

2304
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,200
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

2305
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,120
Yes.

2306
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:00,880
Okay.

2307
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:28,920
Inexplicably mimicking him hiccuping and amicably welcoming him in.

2308
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,000
I don't think...

2309
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:35,580
I don't think I've ever had to try that one.

2310
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:39,040
Okay, that's good enough.

2311
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:40,140
Save point.

2312
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:41,160
Save point.

2313
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:44,120
That's a rare one.

2314
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,200
Run.

2315
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,520
What is it?

2316
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:49,660
Save point.

2317
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:51,900
Run.

2318
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:56,840
Okay.

2319
02:03:57,580 --> 02:04:00,440
Oh, we made it through the restaurant everybody.

2320
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,680
Tongue twister god.

2321
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:05,520
Blood, blood.

2322
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:07,640
Blood, blood, blood, bug blood.

2323
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,060
Nice.

2324
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:17,000
Nice, and we got to...

2325
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,280
We got the extra health pack even.

2326
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:23,180
My hair, what about it?

2327
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,420
What about my hair?

2328
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:26,120
Wait, do you want me to have short hair?

2329
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:28,540
Okay.

2330
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,620
Which section was it?

2331
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:34,120
Section 3.

2332
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:38,720
Red.

2333
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:40,940
Was it section 3 or 4?

2334
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:43,780
Nope.

2335
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:45,620
Section 4.

2336
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,080
Section 4.

2337
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:48,260
No!

2338
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:53,600
Right eye.

2339
02:04:58,960 --> 02:04:59,280
Flee.

2340
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,060
Flee.

2341
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:07,940
Right eye.

2342
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:10,080
I think I'm just going to die you guys.

2343
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,860
I don't want to do this.

2344
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:13,140
Flee.

2345
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,420
Enemy 2.

2346
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:18,860
Hind leg.

2347
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:20,480
Front leg.

2348
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:25,180

2349
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:27,760

2350
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:30,880
Red stomach.

2351
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:33,360
Oh my god!

2352
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:36,240
Right.

2353
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:37,960
Move right.

2354
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:44,400
That was so clean.

2355
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:45,080
Reload.

2356
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:50,700
It heard that I was going to kill myself.

2357
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,040
The game knew I was going to kill myself.

2358
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:53,720
Yeah!

2359
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:55,460
Move right.

2360
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:55,520

2361
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:58,440

2362
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,420
Right eye.

2363
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:02,360
Move right.

2364
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,280
Right eye.

2365
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,300
Left eye.

2366
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:09,560
Middle eye.

2367
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:11,760
Red eye.

2368
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:13,680
Red eye.

2369
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:19,180

2370
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:21,320
Body.

2371
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:22,780
Body.

2372
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:24,920
Reload.

2373
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,100
Move right.

2374
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:33,700
Body.

2375
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:36,380
Tail.

2376
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:45,450
Wait, did we get something extra for that?

2377
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:49,470
Oh my god!

2378
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:50,630
He gave us another one!

2379
02:06:51,390 --> 02:06:53,410
We could farm them here.

2380
02:06:54,350 --> 02:06:55,030
Interesting.

2381
02:06:59,190 --> 02:06:59,870
Interesting.

2382
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:00,550
Interesting.

2383
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:03,690
Okay, so we are at...

2384
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,890
Section 3.

2385
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:07,150
Is it section?

2386
02:07:07,330 --> 02:07:08,550
Guys, it's so...

2387
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:10,070
The thing is all backwards.

2388
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:11,350
I can't tell which is what.

2389
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:13,810
I know, we killed him so clean.

2390
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:15,150
Yes, sir.

2391
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:16,710
I thought about ending myself.

2392
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:21,910
It's 4?

2393
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:23,090
Section 4.

2394
02:07:24,970 --> 02:07:25,210
Run.

2395
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:27,210
Thank you.

2396
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:28,710
Thank you for the help.

2397
02:07:29,930 --> 02:07:30,670
Thank you.

2398
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:31,870
Wait, no.

2399
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,830

2400
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:35,370
No!

2401
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:40,410

2402
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:42,770
Left stomach.

2403
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:45,010
Left stomach.

2404
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:46,150
Oh wait.

2405
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:46,970

2411
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:00,730
Oh no.

2412
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:01,850
Flee.

2413
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:06,910
Flee.

2414
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:10,190

Wait, do we get another one then?

2447
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,440
Do we get another another?

2448
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:27,800
She is an awful shot.

2449
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:28,760
She truly is.

2450
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,880
She is just a waitress.

2451
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:35,800
She is just...

2452
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,560
She is just a waitress.

2453
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:38,340
Wait.

2454
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:39,140

2455
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:42,100
Hello?

2456
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:44,400

Check panel.

2458
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:53,780
Oh my god, a chandelier.

02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:54,960
Chandelier.

2460
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:05,380
Launcher.

2461
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,720
It's okay, we got some extras which is kind of neat.

2462
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:14,800
We farmed a couple.

2463
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:15,640
We farmed a couple.

2464
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:19,880

2468
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:47,090
Yeah, we still have two.

2469
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:50,910
Okay, what's in there?

2470
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:52,490
Wait, maybe I should have saved.

2471
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:53,910
Oh well.

2472
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:55,250
That's fine.

2473

Oh, there's a person!

2474
02:10:57,870 --> 02:10:59,010
Hello, mister?

2475
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:02,690
Are you hurt from the grenade launcher?

2476
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:08,370
Oh my god, he's a chef.

2477
02:11:10,630 --> 02:11:12,070
Ansem the Wise?

2478
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:19,690
Where did they go?

2479
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:21,590
Did they get eaten?

2480
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:25,850
Oh damn!

2481
02:11:30,030 --> 02:11:31,930
Am I real?

2482
02:11:38,690 --> 02:11:40,190
This is a restaurant actually.

2483
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:52,330
You're welcome.

2484
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:53,450
And me too.

2485
02:11:54,390 --> 02:11:55,090
What are you giving me?

2486
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:56,910
Wait, is this for the elevator?

2487
02:11:57,110 --> 02:11:58,490
Oh nice!

2488
02:12:00,970 --> 02:12:01,670
Let's go.

2489
02:12:10,370 --> 02:12:11,530
I don't know.

2490
02:12:14,830 --> 02:12:16,370
That's such a bizarre...

2491
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:20,270
He didn't even mention his family.

2492
02:12:22,930 --> 02:12:25,610
That's how you say it in Spanish.

2493
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:29,730
Nice.

2494
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:34,930
I hope you'll be able to see your family again.

2495
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:36,670
I have no family.

2496
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:39,770
It's exit...yeah.

2497
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:41,430
Exit 1.

2498
02:12:43,410 --> 02:12:44,110
Actually wait.

2499
02:12:44,610 --> 02:12:45,660
Save point.

2500
02:12:47,330 --> 02:12:47,530
Run.

2501
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:51,750
The elevator.

2502
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:56,470
Yeah, I know.

2503
02:12:56,670 --> 02:12:57,210
The elevator.

2504
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:00,370
The elevator!

2505
02:13:00,370 --> 02:13:00,550
Yeah!

2506
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:07,450
Nice.

2507
02:13:14,370 --> 02:13:16,450
Would you guys play a game like this?

2508
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:18,150
Made in modern times.

2509
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:20,690
I watched...what was it?

2510
02:13:20,850 --> 02:13:21,630
What's his name?

2511
02:13:22,190 --> 02:13:22,850
Oh my gosh.

2512
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:27,950
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

2513
02:13:28,030 --> 02:13:28,630
What's his name?

2514
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,370
Oh my gosh.

2515
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:32,770
He...I saw him play a game of...

2516
02:13:35,690 --> 02:13:37,690
With...it was like an AI using...

2517
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:40,390
Like it used basically chat GPT.

2518
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:43,130
But as...

2519
02:13:43,130 --> 02:13:44,830
With...but voiced speech.

2520
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:47,030
And it really truly felt like this game.

2521
02:13:47,650 --> 02:13:48,330
Charlie!

2522
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:50,970
Yeah, the moist critical.

2523
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,570
Exit 1.

2524
02:13:58,110 --> 02:14:00,850
I think...I think we'll probably get ambushed in the next...

2525
02:14:00,850 --> 02:14:01,470
Oh, we're here.

2526
02:14:03,410 --> 02:14:05,570
Or this is just a transition cutscene.

2527
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:08,470
Okay, we probably will get ambushed out here I imagine.

2528
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:11,290
Since we did before.

2529
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:14,890
Elevator.

2530
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:18,850
Don't get ambushed.

2531
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:22,270
We made it!

2532
02:14:26,630 --> 02:14:27,270
Okay.

2533
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:28,510
What is it?

2534
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:32,550
What is it?

2535
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:43,250
0-4-2-3 0-4-2-3 No, no, where are you going?

2536
02:14:43,570 --> 02:14:43,730
No!

2537
02:14:44,770 --> 02:14:45,410
No!

2538
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:46,690
Elevator.

2539
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:57,570
I answered it!

2540
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:00,130
Oh there.

2541
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:00,890
Touch panel.

2542
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:15,170
0-4-2-3 You can use code Boomer to get...

2543
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:17,710
I tried that.

2544
02:15:17,830 --> 02:15:18,490
Strawberry Q.

2545
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:20,370
Yeah, because they sent that to me for free.

2546
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:26,650
It's okay.

2547
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:28,970
Safety.

2548
02:15:29,570 --> 02:15:32,110
Please do not release the safety bar.

2549
02:15:33,010 --> 02:15:33,290
Hey, look!

2550
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:35,790
There's section 3.

2551
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:37,770
Which was sealed during the tremor.

2552
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:39,430
That looks messed up.

2553
02:15:40,610 --> 02:15:42,170
There...wouldn't be anyone left.

2554
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:47,750
The lights will now be turned off for optimum visibility of the external environment.

2555
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:50,750
Please enjoy the cosmic vista.

2556
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:52,430
The cosmic vista.

2557
02:15:52,610 --> 02:15:53,770
Sightseeing in space.

2558
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:58,110
Emotional music.

2559
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:03,110
They say that people finally began viewing themselves objectively after they started seeing Earth from space.

2560
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:08,610
Perhaps also...

2561
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:12,110
Maybe they felt a separation with reality as well.

2562
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:15,710
But what about you?

2563
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:17,170
What about me?

2564
02:16:17,230 --> 02:16:18,070
Are you really alive?

2565
02:16:18,710 --> 02:16:19,370
Am I alive?

2566
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:20,370
No.

2567
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:22,410
You are such a joker operator.

2568
02:16:22,630 --> 02:16:23,350
I'm a ghost!

2569
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:26,630
What were the first words your mother taught you as a child?

2570
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:32,840
Pee-pee.

2571
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:34,920
Words of greeting are always good.

2572
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:43,760
We seem to have reached the junction.

2573
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:47,780
This is how you greet people in French everybody.

2574
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:48,840
Pee-pee.

2575
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:50,880
Was what?

2576
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,360
It's German for we.

2577
02:16:52,980 --> 02:16:53,260
We.

2578
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:55,200
Also French.

2579
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:56,200
Oh, just kidding.

2580
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:57,360
We.

2581
02:16:58,060 --> 02:16:58,620
Oui, oui.

2582
02:16:58,960 --> 02:16:59,640
Pee-pee.

2583
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:04,620
Mom pointed at herself and then at me and taught me that word.

2584
02:17:08,100 --> 02:17:09,380
I love the word.

2585
02:17:09,980 --> 02:17:10,540
Oui.

2586
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:11,660
Oui.

2587
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,440
It makes it seem as if I'm not all alone.

2588
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:18,640
Just like now.

2589
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:22,340
How does she know where the camera is?

2590
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,960
She loves the word oui, oui.

2591
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:29,780
Hey, what's your favorite word or saying?

2592
02:17:32,300 --> 02:17:33,960
My favorite word...

2593
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:35,780
Mint.

2594
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:36,980
You don't have one?

2595
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:38,800
Okay.

2596
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:44,700
You're probably thinking, why is she asking me this all of a sudden?

2597
02:17:45,740 --> 02:17:46,620
Hot dog.

2598
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:47,500
I should have said that last time.

2599
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,000
Well, I just wanted to get to know you better.

2600
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:50,800
Hot dog.

2601
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:53,020
After all, we don't know anything about each other.

2602
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:55,900
Despite the fact that we're partners, right?

2603
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:57,680
You don't tell me anything.

2604
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:58,840
Would you like to know more about me?

2605
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,800
Oh my gosh, yes.

2606
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:01,260
Yes, please.

2607
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,360
You haven't told me anything.

2608
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:06,960
You might not believe me, but...

2609
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:10,440
Also, these...

2610
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:11,780
I've never had a boyfriend before.

2611
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:12,920
Why are you telling me that?

2612
02:18:13,520 --> 02:18:15,120
I'm a girl without a heart.

2613
02:18:15,640 --> 02:18:18,320
Oh my gosh, and I'm a ghost without a heart.

2614
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:19,440
But I'm beginning to understand.

2615
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:25,720
It's better for people to be with someone rather than being alone.

2616
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:27,160
Thank you, thank you.

2617
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:30,460
When we get back to Earth...

2618
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:31,200
Rio, the home record.

2619
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:33,040
Maybe I'll get you to introduce me to someone.

2620
02:18:35,060 --> 02:18:36,520
I was going to say...

2621
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:40,340
Please remain seated until the safety bar has been lifted.

2622
02:18:40,740 --> 02:18:42,240
Well then again, what about you?

2623
02:18:46,340 --> 02:18:46,780
What?

2624
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:48,680
But I suppose there is no chance of that, huh?

2625
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:53,860
She wants me!

2626
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:55,840
She wants me!

2627
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:06,510
The views during that whole segment were so beautiful, so good.

2628
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:07,310
Oh my gosh.

2629
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:11,430
Suggesting the scimitar.

2630
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:12,810
Doki michi kuro.

2631
02:19:13,010 --> 02:19:14,530
No, no, no.

2632
02:19:15,810 --> 02:19:16,230
Oh my gosh.

2633
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:20,450
Finally, her reflexes.

2634
02:19:22,770 --> 02:19:23,250
What happened?

2635
02:19:28,810 --> 02:19:30,110
That's a death flag.

2636
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:35,950
Wobble.

2637
02:19:37,930 --> 02:19:38,890
Johnston, what can I help you with?

2638
02:19:41,490 --> 02:19:42,990
Good thing we just got out of there.

2639
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:45,750
We got a severe wobble.

2640
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:52,950
Wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble.

2641
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:54,050
Okay, where are we?

2642
02:19:55,090 --> 02:19:56,890
That's a great question.

2643
02:19:59,450 --> 02:20:00,890
Exit 2.

2644
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:01,970
Run.

2645
02:20:03,730 --> 02:20:04,810
That's where we are going to go.

2646
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:06,690
Oh, that's a bad option.

2647
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:08,070
We chose the wrong way.

2648
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:10,810
Right eye.

2649
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:12,970
Left eye.

2650
02:20:13,930 --> 02:20:14,230
Flee.

2651
02:20:16,090 --> 02:20:17,110
Middle eye.

2652
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:19,270
Red eye.

2653
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:23,620
Body.

2654
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:25,480
Tail.

2655
02:20:26,580 --> 02:20:26,880
Flee.

2656
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:29,420
Flee.

2657
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,280
Body.

2658
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:34,080
Oh my gosh, this is stupid.

2659
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:34,880
Body.

2660
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:36,840
Stop.

2661
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:37,620
Flee.

2662
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:39,880
Move right.

2663
02:20:43,140 --> 02:20:43,980
Flee.

2664
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:46,280
Move left.

2665
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:47,960
Move left.

2666
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:49,340
Move left.

2667
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:50,840
Move left.

2668
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:52,840
Move left.

2669
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:54,780
We are going to die here because of this.

2670
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:55,640
We are going to die here.

2671
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:57,120
Body.

2672
02:20:58,460 --> 02:20:58,940
Move.

2673
02:21:07,010 --> 02:21:09,230
If you die, you get to answer hotdog.

2674
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:10,350
That's true.

2675
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:12,470
We are going to have to do this.

2676
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:14,510
Okay, we are not going to go to exit 2 first.

2677
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:16,850
God dang it.

2678
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:23,650
That room is tough because it's so small.

2679
02:21:25,350 --> 02:21:26,310
Oh man.

2680
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:34,480
We will go to exit 1 instead.

2681
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:37,780
Ah.

2682
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,360
Alright.

2683
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:43,100
Exit 1.

2684
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,800
Yeah, emotional scene, take 2.

2685
02:21:52,300 --> 02:21:54,200
Wait, what was the code?

2686
02:21:57,580 --> 02:21:58,980
0423, I think.

2687
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:01,980
Elevator.

2688
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:04,040
Yeah.

2689
02:22:09,970 --> 02:22:10,890
8008.

2690
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:17,930
I think it was, right?

2691
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:20,910
0423.

2692
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:22,050
Yeah.

2693
02:22:23,950 --> 02:22:25,390
I remember.

2694
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:28,670
Favorite word is Rio.

2695
02:22:32,090 --> 02:22:34,890
That would be kind of insane.

2696
02:22:41,330 --> 02:22:42,090
Die.

2697
02:22:47,950 --> 02:22:49,470
No way.

2698
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:56,090
At least this is a nice little break time.

2699
02:23:01,170 --> 02:23:03,410
See, like this view is insane.

2700
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:04,970
So awesome.

2701
02:23:04,970 --> 02:23:05,230
So awesome.

2702
02:23:05,890 --> 02:23:08,850
It looks so good.

2703
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:10,710
Like the aesthetic and everything.

2704
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:12,410
Looks so awesome.

2705
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:27,390
Game does look good, yeah.

2706
02:23:30,070 --> 02:23:30,830
Yes.

2707
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:38,050
Milk.

2708
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:44,370
What are you talking about?

2709
02:23:47,290 --> 02:23:47,830
Ok.

2710
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:53,850
Wir.

2711
02:23:55,510 --> 02:23:56,050
We.

2712
02:23:57,350 --> 02:23:58,090
I'm going to tell that.

2713
02:23:58,150 --> 02:24:00,090
I'm going to say Kiara.

2714
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:00,910
Wir.

2715
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:14,750
We.

2716
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:16,630
We.

2717
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:21,590
So...

2718
02:24:21,590 --> 02:24:21,730
We.

2719
02:24:23,390 --> 02:24:24,230
Ok guys.

2720
02:24:24,950 --> 02:24:26,330
Riz 100, right now.

2721
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:28,030
Riz 100.

2722
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:30,770
Yep.

2723
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:31,210
Hey.

2724
02:24:31,690 --> 02:24:33,550
What's your favorite word or saying?

2725
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:36,350
Rio.

2726
02:24:38,470 --> 02:24:39,390
Is that right?

2727
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:44,930
You're probably thinking, why is she asking me this all of a sudden?

2728
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:46,570
That lukewarm reaction.

2729
02:24:47,370 --> 02:24:49,310
Well, I just wanted to get to know you better.

2730
02:24:49,670 --> 02:24:50,150
Nevermind.

2731
02:24:50,810 --> 02:24:51,810
I take it back.

2732
02:24:51,970 --> 02:24:53,330
After all, we don't know anything about each other.

2733
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:56,230
Despite the fact that we're partners, right?

2734
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:57,870
We're partners in crime.

2735
02:24:57,890 --> 02:24:59,150
Would you like to know more about me?

2736
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:00,550
No.

2737
02:25:04,050 --> 02:25:04,450
Ok.

2738
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:06,090
Unless she's going to tell me anyway.

2739
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:17,530
Why is that unbelievable?

2740
02:25:19,050 --> 02:25:20,350
Why is that unbelievable, huh?

2741
02:25:20,450 --> 02:25:22,130
You think you're an egotistical woman?

2742
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:23,610
You think you're so sought after?

2743
02:25:24,990 --> 02:25:25,330
Huh?

2744
02:25:32,430 --> 02:25:33,770
Guys, Rio is single.

2745
02:25:34,190 --> 02:25:35,710
You just have to tell her every command.

2746
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:37,110
Actually, you guys...

2747
02:25:37,110 --> 02:25:38,850
Some of you might actually really love that.

2748
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:44,050
Some of you might be really excited about that actually.

2749
02:25:44,050 --> 02:25:46,050
Well then again, what about you?

2750
02:25:50,210 --> 02:25:52,450
But I suppose there's no chance of that, huh?

2751
02:25:56,730 --> 02:26:00,850
Some people would be like, I love a girl without free will.

2752
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:03,570
She's so stupid.

2753
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:05,290
I like her.

2754
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:07,370
She's best that way.

2755
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:16,410
No, Rio!

2756
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:23,570
I have to not die here because I don't want to go through all that.

2757
02:26:23,690 --> 02:26:25,050
This cutscene is so long.

2758
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:32,290
A severe wobble was detected in the space station's rotation.

2759
02:26:33,250 --> 02:26:35,930
The station was placed on emergency status.

2760
02:26:36,470 --> 02:26:39,130
Although the wobble will not interfere with it's orbit.

2761
02:26:41,190 --> 02:26:43,110
Elevator use is prohibited.

2762
02:26:43,450 --> 02:26:44,530
How are we supposed to get back?

2763
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:48,510
I guess...

2764
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:50,670
Well, she did say she wanted to go to my room.

2765
02:26:51,710 --> 02:26:51,730
Right?

2766
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:53,970
What if Gio's on the other side?

2767
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:56,450
She's like a Metal Gear character.

2768
02:26:57,170 --> 02:26:57,550
Who?

2769
02:26:57,710 --> 02:26:58,330
Which Metal Gear?

2770
02:27:01,310 --> 02:27:02,110
Exit 1.

2771
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:03,310
Alright.

2772
02:27:05,930 --> 02:27:06,670
To the bed.

2773
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:07,070
Okay.

2774
02:27:10,510 --> 02:27:13,110
Alright, if we can at least get a save point that would be great.

2775
02:27:13,930 --> 02:27:14,830
Meant in Rio's wedding.

2776
02:27:14,990 --> 02:27:15,890
You may kiss the bride.

2777
02:27:16,330 --> 02:27:16,730
Stomach!

2778
02:27:18,270 --> 02:27:19,730
This is horribly wrecked.

2779
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:23,190
Ahead of here is the senior staff section.

2780
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:25,150
Where should I go?

2781
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:28,250
We got quite a few rooms, eh?

2782
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:30,050
We got break room.

2783
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:33,630
We got manager's office.

2784
02:27:33,990 --> 02:27:35,490
Wait, look we're in section...

2785
02:27:35,490 --> 02:27:38,290
It's showing us the sections that we have left.

2786
02:27:38,470 --> 02:27:40,350
So there's other and then laboratory.

2787
02:27:41,610 --> 02:27:42,790
I guess we'll go to the...

2788
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:44,730
Break room.

2789
02:27:44,810 --> 02:27:45,470
The break room.

2790
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:46,030
Okay.

2791
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:56,640
Oh, okay.

2792
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:57,380
Get ambushed.

2793
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:00,220
I don't even know what it is.

2794
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,280
Right eye.

2795
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:04,020
Right eye.

2796
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:06,220
Right eye.

2797
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:08,460
Right eye.

2798
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:10,620
Left eye.

2799
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:12,880
Left eye.

2800
02:28:14,380 --> 02:28:15,180
Left eye.

2801
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:17,560
Middle eye.

2802
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:19,820
Middle eye.

2803
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:21,580
Shoot!

2804
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:24,340
Red eye.

2805
02:28:30,210 --> 02:28:30,790
Shoot!

2806
02:28:31,370 --> 02:28:31,950
Run!

2807
02:28:34,530 --> 02:28:35,950
Oh my god!

2808
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:37,190
That was so messed up.

2809
02:28:37,410 --> 02:28:37,730
Tail!

2810
02:28:38,910 --> 02:28:39,410
Tail!

2811
02:28:39,850 --> 02:28:40,810
Shoot!

2812
02:28:41,890 --> 02:28:42,470
Shoot!

2813
02:28:42,910 --> 02:28:44,070
Shoot!

2814
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:45,670
Shoot!

2815
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:46,310
Now!

2816
02:28:48,390 --> 02:28:49,050
Shoot!

2817
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:50,590
Shoot!

2818
02:28:51,410 --> 02:28:52,090
Shoot!

2819
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:54,010
Oh no.

2820
02:28:55,950 --> 02:28:56,530
Shoot!

2821
02:29:00,510 --> 02:29:01,270
Mouth!

2822
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:05,030
You had one shot left Rio.

2823
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:06,050
Come on girl.

2824
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:10,910
At least she did some good aim at least.

2825
02:29:15,190 --> 02:29:16,370
Break room.

2826
02:29:17,850 --> 02:29:18,490
Run.

2827
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:23,510
Square bar!

2828
02:29:24,010 --> 02:29:24,950
Thanks for the 10 gift!

2829
02:29:25,470 --> 02:29:26,450
Thank you!

2830
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:33,180
Save points.

2831
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:35,860
No.

2832
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:36,680
Leave.

2833
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:38,000
Run!

2834
02:29:40,210 --> 02:29:40,900
Oh my god.

2835
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:41,280
Is this...

2836
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:41,600
Run!

2837
02:29:45,940 --> 02:29:47,040
Left claw?

2838
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:48,500
Run!

2839
02:30:01,830 --> 02:30:02,270
Recover.

2840
02:30:03,450 --> 02:30:03,890
Recover.

2841
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:05,370
Reco...

2842
02:30:28,050 --> 02:30:29,490
I hate this one so much.

2843
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:30,170
Eye!

2844
02:30:31,090 --> 02:30:31,470
Eye!

2845
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:32,130
Eye!

2846
02:30:32,830 --> 02:30:33,230
Flee!

2847
02:30:34,330 --> 02:30:35,150
Flee!

2848
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:48,680
Flee!

2849
02:30:49,900 --> 02:30:50,460
Flee!

2850
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:51,800
Oh my god.

2851
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:53,180
It's the fact that she...

2852
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:53,460
Flee!

2853
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:55,180
It's the fact that she doesn't...

2854
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,040
Mouth!

2855
02:30:57,300 --> 02:30:57,900
Mouth!

2856
02:30:58,660 --> 02:30:59,480
Oh my god.

2857
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,120
Flee!

2858
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:03,520
Mouth!

2859
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:05,240
Oh my god.

2860
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:08,000
This is the worst room to do this fight in ever.

2861
02:31:08,520 --> 02:31:08,840
Flee!

2862
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:10,860
Flee!

2863
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:13,540
Flee!

2864
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:16,480
Flee!

2865
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:17,880
Oh

2866
02:31:21,930 --> 02:31:22,230
my god.

2867
02:31:22,330 --> 02:31:23,170
Oh my god.

2868
02:31:23,170 --> 02:31:24,330
Hold on.

2869
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:28,380
It's going to get in the way so much.

2870
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:32,400
This is the worst room to do this fight.

2871
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:33,840
This is the worst room to do this fight.

2872
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,460
This is the worst room to do this fight.

2873
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:40,520
And then as soon as I'm going to be able to lock on it...

2874
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:42,540
It's going to disappear and move somewhere else.

2875
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,120
I can't do this.

2876
02:31:45,180 --> 02:31:46,060
I can't do this.

2877
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:46,920
I can't do this.

2878
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:48,340
I think I can't do this.

2879
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:51,960
Tell her to target the enemy after it disappears.

2880
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:54,040
Oh my god.

2881
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:08,220
Try dodging and...

2882
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,160
Her dodge is also so bad though.

2883
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,820
She just jumps one step.

2884
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:12,880
Okay.

2885
02:32:13,460 --> 02:32:13,720
Alright.

2886
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:17,020
Dodge!

2887
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:17,960
Dodge!

2888
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:19,380
Dodge!

2889
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:20,440
Okay, that doesn't work.

2890
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:20,760
Run!

2891
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:23,220
Target the enemy!

2892
02:32:23,960 --> 02:32:24,460
Nevermind.

2893
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:26,820
Flee!

2894
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:43,300
Run!

2895
02:32:46,380 --> 02:32:47,140
Flee!

2896
02:32:53,450 --> 02:32:54,170
Shoot!

2897
02:32:54,670 --> 02:32:55,430
Oh my god.

2898
02:32:57,030 --> 02:32:58,030
Dodge left!

2899
02:32:58,950 --> 02:32:59,570
Dodge...

2900
02:32:59,570 --> 02:33:00,450
Dodge right...

2901
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:00,650
Back!

2902
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:02,810
Okay, that works.

2903
02:33:23,030 --> 02:33:24,230
Almost didn't work.

2904
02:33:25,410 --> 02:33:26,210
Almost didn't work.

2905
02:33:28,090 --> 02:33:28,810
Flee!

2906
02:33:30,490 --> 02:33:30,870
Flee!

2907
02:33:54,250 --> 02:33:55,870
I can't get it though.

2908
02:33:56,150 --> 02:33:56,670
Dodge right!

2909
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:02,660
Flee!

2910
02:34:46,790 --> 02:34:48,650
Something do anything please.

2911
02:34:49,650 --> 02:34:50,170
Run!

2912
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:03,240
Oh my god.

2913
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:03,780
It's almost dead.

2914
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:04,680
Just a little bit more.

2915
02:35:05,380 --> 02:35:05,600
Ai!

2916
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:09,680
Run!

2917
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:10,680
Flee!

2918
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:12,360
Ai!

2919
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:13,440
Oh, nevermind.

2920
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:14,540
Flee!

2921
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:17,440
Oh my god.

2922
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:18,000
Ai!

2923
02:35:23,900 --> 02:35:24,120
No!

2924
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:24,420
Flee!

2925
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:25,880
Flee!

2926
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:26,320
Flee!

2927
02:35:39,710 --> 02:35:41,510
At least she did it.

2928
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:42,610
Okay, okay.

2929
02:35:43,830 --> 02:35:44,250
Oh my gosh.

2930
02:35:44,310 --> 02:35:44,490
Flee!

2931
02:35:45,630 --> 02:35:46,710
Actually, fine.

2932
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:47,030
Whatever.

2933
02:35:47,130 --> 02:35:47,790
I don't care anymore.

2934
02:35:48,230 --> 02:35:48,530
Flee!

2935
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:50,190
Ai!

2936
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:57,270
Flee!

2937
02:36:00,970 --> 02:36:02,150
Maybe I should jump there.

2938
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:02,490
Ai!

2939
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:05,070
Jump!

2940
02:36:05,790 --> 02:36:06,250
Jump!

2941
02:36:07,410 --> 02:36:07,790
Jump!

2942
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:15,020
Oh my god.

2943
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:15,620
It worked though.

2944
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:16,060
Oh my god.

2945
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:17,100
Jump!

2946
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:19,340
Ai!

2947
02:36:20,320 --> 02:36:20,640
Ai!

2948
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:22,020
Shoot!

2949
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:23,560
Okay, you know what?

2950
02:36:23,580 --> 02:36:23,760
Whatever.

2951
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:23,960
Jump!

2952
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:27,060
It works!

2953
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:28,060
Ai!

2954
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:31,300
Oh my gosh.

2955
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:32,240
I can't believe it works.

2956
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:33,220
I can't believe it works.

2957
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:36,140
I mean we wasted like three health I think on that thing.

2958
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:38,440
Holy cow.

2959
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:39,920
Oh my gosh.

2960
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:44,000
We had four.

2961
02:36:47,610 --> 02:36:49,510
We had four health.

2962
02:36:51,890 --> 02:36:54,130
I want you to give me instructions.

2963
02:36:55,130 --> 02:36:56,530
She sells.

2964
02:37:00,510 --> 02:37:02,070
Gilroy, thanks for three months!

2965
02:37:05,950 --> 02:37:06,230
Oh.

2966
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:07,270
Yes.

2967
02:37:14,510 --> 02:37:15,590
Okay.

2968
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:19,370
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

2969
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:20,710
No!

2970
02:37:21,730 --> 02:37:23,850
I did blow that one.

2971
02:37:23,890 --> 02:37:26,170
Holy, that fight was so frustrating.

2972
02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:29,190
I need like a break after that.

2973
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:30,650
She sells.

2974
02:37:32,070 --> 02:37:33,710
I need such a break.

2975
02:37:34,270 --> 02:37:35,030
Holy cow.

2976
02:37:35,370 --> 02:37:35,710
Yes!

2977
02:37:37,410 --> 02:37:40,110
If you can handle this, you can handle Dark Souls.

2978
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:49,750
Around the rugged rocks, the ragged rascal ran.

2979
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:54,770
I think if I can handle this game, I can do anything in my afterlife.

2980
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:55,350
Truly.

2981
02:37:57,510 --> 02:38:00,110
I think if I can do this game, I can do anything.

2982
02:38:03,990 --> 02:38:05,230
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

2983
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:06,490
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

2984
02:38:06,650 --> 02:38:08,190
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

2985
02:38:11,950 --> 02:38:12,750
Finish Iwariya.

2986
02:38:17,170 --> 02:38:18,470
Oh gosh, this one again?

2987
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:28,690
She stood on the balcony, inexplicably mimicking him, hiccuping, and amicably welcoming him in.

2988
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:31,710
Let's not get too far.

2989
02:38:33,590 --> 02:38:34,890
I did it!

2990
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:40,670
Beat Celeste.

2991
02:38:44,610 --> 02:38:45,990
We'll go to full health.

2992
02:38:46,270 --> 02:38:46,970
She sells.

2993
02:38:48,010 --> 02:38:49,270
I will save, don't worry.

2994
02:38:49,570 --> 02:38:51,750
I'm getting my health full and then I'm going to save.

2995
02:38:55,170 --> 02:38:58,110
Despite everything, there isn't an easier way to kill this enemy.

2996
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:06,810
Around the rugged rocks, the ragged rascal ran.

2997
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:09,470
I'm a powerful gamer.

2998
02:39:09,610 --> 02:39:10,290
Thank you.

2999
02:39:12,610 --> 02:39:13,930
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

3000
02:39:14,150 --> 02:39:15,530
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

3001
02:39:21,410 --> 02:39:22,490
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

3002
02:39:22,490 --> 02:39:22,830
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.

3003
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:24,070
Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair.

3004
02:39:24,190 --> 02:39:25,850
Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy.

3005
02:39:26,490 --> 02:39:30,490
The jump strike, as soon as we started doing that, was so good actually.

3006
02:39:31,030 --> 02:39:31,970
Should have done that earlier.

3007
02:39:33,170 --> 02:39:33,770
But we learned.

3008
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:35,550
We learned.

3009
02:39:37,910 --> 02:39:38,290
Again?

3010
02:39:40,350 --> 02:39:45,730
She stood on the balcony, inexplicably mimicking him, hiccuping, and amicably welcoming him in.

3011
02:39:47,590 --> 02:39:47,990
Nice.

3012
02:39:54,730 --> 02:39:57,210
The amount of time she got caught in the heel of that blast.

3013
02:39:57,350 --> 02:39:58,530
Right, that's what I'm saying.

3014
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:03,210
I should have just been jumping to avoid it instead of trying to flee when she wasn't even targeting it.

3015
02:40:03,390 --> 02:40:05,090
So she didn't know how far to run.

3016
02:40:08,210 --> 02:40:08,910
It's okay.

3017
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:11,090
We've only fought that enemy like what, two...

3018
02:40:13,050 --> 02:40:13,450
Times?

3019
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:14,390
Now?

3020
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:15,730
So...

3021
02:40:16,610 --> 02:40:17,790
We've learned.

3022
02:40:18,230 --> 02:40:18,930
Save point.

3023
02:40:21,410 --> 02:40:22,710
Yeah, so we learned.

3024
02:40:24,610 --> 02:40:25,990
You say flee and she goes three steps.

3025
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:29,730
The reason that is happening is because she...

3026
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:33,390
I learned this last stream.

3027
02:40:33,710 --> 02:40:38,910
When she flees, she is running from whatever enemy she is targeting.

3028
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:42,670
So if she's not targeting anything, she just runs a couple steps.

3029
02:40:43,490 --> 02:40:46,090
It's not that she... It's not that she...

3030
02:40:46,490 --> 02:40:47,790
It's so stupid.

3031
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:49,790
Yeah, she can't register what she's fleeing from.

3032
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:50,730
Exactly, exactly.

3033
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:52,750
So it's like... It's so frustrating.

3034
02:40:53,510 --> 02:40:54,470
It's so frustrating.

3035
02:40:55,150 --> 02:40:56,130
Anyway, we're good.

3036
02:40:56,330 --> 02:40:57,470
We're calm, we're cool.

3037
02:40:57,610 --> 02:40:58,310
We got through it.

3038
02:40:58,410 --> 02:40:59,290
Gamer, yoohoo!

3039
02:40:59,890 --> 02:41:02,410
Welcome to membership and Celestia!

3040
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:04,590
Welcome to membership too!

3041
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:05,590

This is a lot.

3129
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:09,800
How do you think I feel?

3130
02:44:10,340 --> 02:44:11,240
How do you think I feel?

3131
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:13,300
I've been playing this game for 8 hours it says.

3132
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:16,020
8 hours of this.

02:44:26,060 --> 02:44:28,780
I don't even know how much more we have left to go.

3137
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:30,720
I don't even know.

3138
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:32,120
Let's check.

3139
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:34,780
I'm gonna check the guide and see how much longer the guide is.

3140
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:39,060
Let's see.

3141
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:42,920
I don't even know.

3142
02:44:43,100 --> 02:44:44,260

We are almost there you guys, actually.

3147
02:44:56,290 --> 02:44:58,490
We are actually not doing so bad, I think.

3148
02:45:00,030 --> 02:45:01,730
Sorry, my voice is a little icky today.

3149
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:04,570
We are actually not doing so bad.

3150
02:45:07,110 --> 02:45:07,910
Almost halfway.

3151
02:45:08,130 --> 02:45:09,290
I don't know how long this game is.

3152
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:12,190
Can you imagine?

3153
02:45:13,010 --> 02:45:15,350
Imagine if the rest was really...

3154
02:45:15,350 --> 02:45:18,330
There's not a lot of areas but it was just that long.

3155
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:21,350
Vending machine.

3156
02:45:25,110 --> 02:45:25,290
Right.

3157
02:45:28,090 --> 02:45:29,650
I'm glad I did this though.

3158
02:45:30,190 --> 02:45:31,150
It's still kind of fun.

3159
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:33,970
Top of vending machine.

3160
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:36,770

3161
02:45:37,390 --> 02:45:37,990
Look up.

3162
02:45:39,790 --> 02:45:41,530
Gamers don't look up.

3163
02:45:42,930 --> 02:45:46,430
Check top of vending machine.

3164
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:52,710

3168
02:46:04,230 --> 02:46:05,550

02:46:07,670 --> 02:46:07,950
Ok.

3172
02:46:08,310 --> 02:46:11,170
When something frustrates you, just go to another place.

3173
02:46:13,690 --> 02:46:15,030

02:46:38,990 --> 02:46:42,470
And another new sexy out...

02:46:53,490 --> 02:46:55,130
I don't know it though.

3191
02:46:56,110 --> 02:46:57,410
I actually don't know it.

3192
02:47:03,930 --> 02:47:04,410
Nyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyanyan...

3193
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:11,090
Remember when you were going to take days off for your voice when you didn't?

3194
02:47:12,370 --> 02:47:14,850
Remember when you weren't such a bitch, Murphy?

3195
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:15,710
Shut up!

3196
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:17,850
What are we looking at?

3197
02:47:18,070 --> 02:47:18,370
Oh no!

3205
02:47:37,350 --> 02:47:38,070
It's shiny.

3206
02:47:39,610 --> 02:47:40,830

What is that?

3212
02:47:58,500 --> 02:47:59,140
Let's go!

3213
02:48:00,340 --> 02:48:01,120
For the bird.

3214
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:04,600
Yippee!

3215
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:07,220
Um, read note.

02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:56,600
Is that the scientist?

3222
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:00,500
That's the scientist guy, right?

Middle cup.

3226
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:14,320
I didn't say blue cup.

3227
02:49:15,220 --> 02:49:16,860
Middle cup.

3228
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:22,740

Oh!

3231
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:29,300
Why'd you do that?

3232
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:30,060
What?

3233
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:38,920
Why did you do that?

3234
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:40,660
Right cup.

3235
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:44,480
Right mug.

3236
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:49,300
Uh...

3237
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:50,640
Left mug.

3238
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:52,820
Oh, she got it.

3239
02:49:52,940 --> 02:49:53,080
Oh!

3240
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:56,520
We got another chip!

3241
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:00,600
I don't know what these do, but we're getting chips.

3242
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:04,060
I don't think there's really anything else to check, but um...

3243
02:50:04,060 --> 02:50:04,400
Box.

3244
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:06,560
No!

3245
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:09,260
Why did she shoot the chair?

3246
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:10,500
Table.

3247
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:13,740
Why did she shoot it?

3248
02:50:14,380 --> 02:50:16,700
Just to show how good the infrastructure is.

3249
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,580
All the furniture here is indestructible.

3250
02:50:19,820 --> 02:50:20,460
Um...

3251
02:50:20,460 --> 02:50:21,160
Cardboard.

3252
02:50:23,420 --> 02:50:24,060
What?!

3253
02:50:25,820 --> 02:50:26,460
Table.

3254
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:27,160
The table.

3255
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:29,980
Coffee.

3256
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:33,680
No, ma'am.

3257
02:50:34,480 --> 02:50:35,200
Uh...

3258
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:35,940
Box.

3259
02:50:37,220 --> 02:50:37,440
Oh!

3260
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:38,780
Okay, I give up.

3261
02:50:38,940 --> 02:50:40,180
I don't care about the coffee.

3262
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:40,640
I don't care.

3263
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:42,560
Um...

3264
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:43,860
Vending machine.

3265
02:50:45,140 --> 02:50:45,440
Yes.

3266
02:50:45,960 --> 02:50:47,660
I don't know!

3267
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:50,980
Okay, um...

3268
02:50:50,980 --> 02:50:51,660
Dispenser.

3269
02:50:51,660 --> 02:50:53,660
Which dispenser are you talking about?

3270
02:50:55,360 --> 02:50:56,660
Check right dispenser.

3271
02:50:59,860 --> 02:51:00,660
Oh?

3272
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:01,280
Oh?

3273
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:02,520
Is something in there?

3274
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:03,320
Oh?

3275
02:51:04,660 --> 02:51:06,620
There was nothing.

3276
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:07,440
Okay.

3277
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:08,580
I'm disappointed.

3278
02:51:08,980 --> 02:51:10,000
Me too, actually.

3279
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:15,320
Top of left vending machine.

3280
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:18,640
Oh my gosh, that worked!

3281
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:22,300
Miss legendary coffee scene?

3282
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:22,980
Okay, fine.

3283
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:23,600
I'll go back.

3284
02:51:23,960 --> 02:51:25,120
I'll tell her to drink the coffee.

3285
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:29,080
Check left dispenser.

3286
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:32,780
Yeah.

3287
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:34,020
It would be good.

3288
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:36,380
I'm looking cute today!

3289
02:51:37,660 --> 02:51:38,960
You can thank my mama.

3290
02:51:40,940 --> 02:51:41,380
Uh...

3291
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:43,840
I don't know how else to say box, you guys.

3292
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:47,480
I don't know how to say box without her thinking that I'm gonna...

3293
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:48,420
That she wants to walk.

3294
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:49,760
I can't even say cardboard.

3295
02:51:50,740 --> 02:51:52,380
Cardboard box.

3296
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:57,860
Oh my god.

3297
02:51:58,800 --> 02:51:59,700
Trash can.

3298
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:02,100
No, it's not!

3299
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:05,480
Look inside trash can.

3300
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:07,920
No, it's not!

3301
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:10,280
Check trash can.

3302
02:52:11,780 --> 02:52:12,060
No!

3303
02:52:14,500 --> 02:52:16,500
Open trash can.

3304
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:21,680
Hmm...

3305
02:52:21,680 --> 02:52:24,680
Left dispenser of right vending machine.

3306
02:52:26,720 --> 02:52:28,780
No, you checked the right one.

3307
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:32,720
Left dispenser of right vending machine.

3308
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:41,220
Right dispenser of right vending machine.

3309
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:45,100
Middle right?

3310
02:52:45,780 --> 02:52:46,840
Middle right!

3311
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:48,440
No!

3312
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:54,480
Vending machine.

3313
02:52:55,240 --> 02:52:56,360
No!

3314
02:52:57,760 --> 02:52:58,620
I love Antarctica!

3315
02:52:59,380 --> 02:53:00,300
Don't melt!

3316
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:04,600
What should I say for the trash can?

3317
02:53:10,910 --> 02:53:12,750
Middle right dispenser.

3318
02:53:16,890 --> 02:53:19,130
Middle left dispenser.

3319
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:23,530
Oh, check third.

3320
02:53:24,010 --> 02:53:26,130
Check third dispenser.

3321
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:29,010
Check third dispenser.

3322
02:53:31,970 --> 02:53:32,650
The third.

3323
02:53:32,830 --> 02:53:33,450
Oh, search.

3324
02:53:33,930 --> 02:53:35,250
Search trash can.

3325
02:53:39,050 --> 02:53:40,290
Tactician zero!

3326
02:53:40,610 --> 02:53:41,330
Welcome to membership.

3327
02:53:41,690 --> 02:53:42,230
Thank you!

3328
02:53:47,630 --> 02:53:49,350
Examine trash can.

3329
02:53:50,990 --> 02:53:53,090
I think she has to open it maybe.

3330
02:53:53,970 --> 02:53:55,170
I don't know how though.

3331
02:53:56,810 --> 02:53:59,330
Throw Rio in trash can.

3332
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:01,750
Rio!

3333
02:54:02,570 --> 02:54:04,570
Inspect trash can.

3334
02:54:07,190 --> 02:54:07,530
What?

3335
02:54:08,830 --> 02:54:10,310
I tried look inside.

3336
02:54:10,810 --> 02:54:13,050
Look inside trash can.

3337
02:54:14,050 --> 02:54:15,990
That wouldn't work.

3338
02:54:22,130 --> 02:54:24,990
I think I almost just...

3339
02:54:25,930 --> 02:54:29,670
If I had blood vessels, I would have burst one.

3340
02:54:30,030 --> 02:54:31,130
Surely, just then.

3341
02:54:34,830 --> 02:54:36,030
Welcome back!

3342
02:54:36,110 --> 02:54:36,710
Thank you!

3343
02:54:37,650 --> 02:54:39,230
Open trash can.

3344
02:54:49,190 --> 02:54:51,650
Knock over trash can.

3345
02:54:54,330 --> 02:54:55,590
Open lid.

3346
02:54:56,810 --> 02:54:59,010
Open trash can lid.

3347
02:55:00,870 --> 02:55:01,590
Yes!

3348
02:55:06,930 --> 02:55:07,970
Oh my god!

3349
02:55:08,910 --> 02:55:10,150
I didn't even need it.

3350
02:55:10,290 --> 02:55:11,870
I didn't need it.

3351
02:55:20,250 --> 02:55:24,270
I wish I would say like dispenser one, dispenser two, dispenser three, you know?

3352
02:55:25,630 --> 02:55:27,530
Check dispenser three.

3353
02:55:29,490 --> 02:55:29,870
I give up.

3354
02:55:30,050 --> 02:55:31,970
I think it's just a cup, you guys.

3355
02:55:32,070 --> 02:55:33,790
So I think there's not really a point.

3356
02:55:37,970 --> 02:55:43,270
I watched bits of all three streams and it feels like the exact same bits are repeating over and over.

3357
02:55:45,570 --> 02:55:46,090
Yeah.

3358
02:55:51,550 --> 02:55:52,070
Yeah.

3359
02:55:55,590 --> 02:55:56,110
Yeah.

3360
02:56:00,190 --> 02:56:00,710
Yeah.

3361
02:56:02,030 --> 02:56:02,810
Save point.

3362
02:56:07,450 --> 02:56:08,130
Yeah.

3363
02:56:10,050 --> 02:56:10,730
Yeah.

3364
02:56:13,470 --> 02:56:14,150
Yeah.

3365
02:56:14,830 --> 02:56:18,250
We'll do this before we check the galley just in case we get ambushed again.

3366
02:56:18,930 --> 02:56:20,170
Minto purgatory.

3367
02:56:21,350 --> 02:56:26,510
Something something insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.

3368
02:56:28,270 --> 02:56:29,910
Is that not the definition?

3369
02:56:31,170 --> 02:56:32,390
Something something.

3370
02:56:32,390 --> 02:56:33,170
Gosh.

3371
02:56:33,330 --> 02:56:34,130
You know what they should do?

3372
02:56:34,250 --> 02:56:35,210
They should give...

3373
02:56:35,210 --> 02:56:35,870
They should...

3374
02:56:35,870 --> 02:56:37,630
To torture people, they should...

3375
02:56:37,630 --> 02:56:38,430
Like, you know...

3376
02:56:38,430 --> 02:56:39,510
Say if...

3377
02:56:39,510 --> 02:56:40,050
If...

3378
02:56:40,050 --> 02:56:40,570
If...

3379
02:56:41,410 --> 02:56:41,930
If...

3380
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:46,550
If I were to be torturing someone, I think I would give them this game and a crunchy mic.

3381
02:56:48,170 --> 02:56:51,390
I would give them this game and a crunchy mic and say...

3382
02:56:52,050 --> 02:56:54,930
Beat it in under ten hours.

3383
02:56:55,550 --> 02:56:57,930
If anyone says Minto is not smart, show them real.

3384
02:56:58,570 --> 02:56:59,450
Who says that?

3385
02:56:59,870 --> 02:57:00,250
Galley.

3386
02:57:02,390 --> 02:57:03,210
The galley.

3387
02:57:03,390 --> 02:57:03,790
Okay.

3388
02:57:05,550 --> 02:57:06,470
The galley.

3389
02:57:09,060 --> 02:57:10,430
I knew it!

3390
02:57:14,470 --> 02:57:15,650
Right eye.

3391
02:57:19,030 --> 02:57:19,520
Right.

3392
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:22,380
Dodge right.

3393
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:24,320
Middle eye.

3394
02:57:28,580 --> 02:57:29,400
Right eye.

3395
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:31,180
Left eye.

3396
02:57:32,500 --> 02:57:33,180
Red eye.

3397
02:57:34,980 --> 02:57:35,320
Mouth.

3398
02:57:36,420 --> 02:57:36,860
Body.

3399
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:42,260
Body.

3400
02:57:51,550 --> 02:57:52,790
We got him as he was...

3401
02:57:52,790 --> 02:57:53,670
Run!

3402
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:59,040
That was so close.

3403
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:00,080
Dodge left.

3404
02:58:01,060 --> 02:58:01,900
Right eye.

3405
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:03,480
Middle eye.

3406
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:05,020
Left eye.

3407
02:58:06,360 --> 02:58:07,080
Red eye.

3408
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:08,780
Mouth.

3409
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:10,660
Dodge left.

3410
02:58:11,820 --> 02:58:12,200
Mouth.

3411
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:13,980
Mouth.

3412
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:16,340
Body.

3413
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:26,600
Tail.

3414
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:28,340
Oh no, she got reload.

3415
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:28,980
She didn't reload.

3416
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:31,700
Why didn't you reload?

3417
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:33,080
You said you were going to.

3418
02:58:34,700 --> 02:58:35,460
Tail.

3419
02:58:36,360 --> 02:58:36,840
Tail.

3420
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:40,740
Is there another one?

3421
02:58:40,860 --> 02:58:41,840
Oh my gosh.

3422
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:42,940
Right eye.

3423
02:58:43,700 --> 02:58:44,380
Right eye.

3424
02:58:45,020 --> 02:58:46,020
Right eye.

3425
02:58:46,060 --> 02:58:46,180
Run!

3426
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:47,660
Run.

3427
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:50,480
Left eye.

3428
02:58:59,000 --> 02:58:59,760
Shoot.

3429
02:59:00,780 --> 02:59:01,680
Middle eye.

3430
02:59:02,980 --> 02:59:04,060
Red eye.

3431
02:59:05,280 --> 02:59:06,160
Mouth.

3432
02:59:07,820 --> 02:59:08,700
Tail.

3433
02:59:09,800 --> 02:59:10,620
Tail.

3434
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:13,900
Tail.

3435
02:59:14,920 --> 02:59:15,600
Dodge right.

3436
02:59:16,720 --> 02:59:17,080
Tail.

3437
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:19,680
Is that it?

3438
02:59:21,660 --> 02:59:28,020
I don't think you can actually use grenades in the battles.

3439
02:59:28,260 --> 02:59:30,460
I think they are literally only for anything.

3440
02:59:30,580 --> 02:59:31,180
I don't know.

3441
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:32,660
I have no idea.

3442
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:35,220
Galley.

3443
02:59:36,120 --> 02:59:37,240
There better be something good in here.

3444
02:59:37,360 --> 02:59:38,200
Oh there is a health pack.

3445
02:59:39,760 --> 02:59:40,280
Coffee.

3446
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:42,760
No!

3447
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:43,740
Stop, stop, stop.

3448
02:59:44,440 --> 02:59:44,800
Stop.

3449
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:45,440
Stop.

3450
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:46,880
Galley.

3451
02:59:50,460 --> 02:59:51,760
How many do I have?

3452
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:53,660
I have a few of them actually.

3453
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:56,680
I have four launcher grenades.

3454
03:00:01,720 --> 03:00:02,240
Chips.

3455
03:00:04,850 --> 03:00:05,460
Tissue.

3456
03:00:07,750 --> 03:00:08,360
Yes.

3457
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:10,160
Tissue paper.

3458
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:11,480
Check tissue paper.

3459
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:14,420
Wow.

3460
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:16,560
Okay.

3461
03:00:17,910 --> 03:00:18,520
Cups.

3462
03:00:21,710 --> 03:00:22,860
Potato chips.

3463
03:00:24,940 --> 03:00:25,500
Sure.

3464
03:00:29,050 --> 03:00:30,580
Check behind T.

3465
03:00:34,060 --> 03:00:36,660
Eat tissue paper.

3466
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:38,400
Yes.

3467
03:00:39,360 --> 03:00:41,440
She is not hungry you guys.

3468
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:42,820
Eat.

3469
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:44,160
Snack.

3470
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:47,220
What is...

3471
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:48,840
Yellow box.

3472
03:00:50,520 --> 03:00:51,080
Yes.

3473
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:51,920
What is that?

3474
03:00:54,020 --> 03:00:55,420
Check T bag.

3475
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,560
Check T bag.

3476
03:01:02,620 --> 03:01:03,440
Check T bag.

3477
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:04,540
Check T bag.

3478
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:07,460
Why did she just tilt her head?

3479
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:09,740
Search T bag.

3480
03:01:11,380 --> 03:01:12,720
T bag.

3481
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:15,420
Oh my god.

3482
03:01:17,280 --> 03:01:18,460
It's a ticket.

3483
03:01:18,980 --> 03:01:19,420
What's this one?

3484
03:01:20,920 --> 03:01:22,080
Jump back!

3485
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:23,600
That's actually pretty good.

3486
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:25,780
Red bag.

3487
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:28,060
Yeah, what is that?

3488
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:30,080
Sugar.

3489
03:01:30,340 --> 03:01:31,780
Oh, I thought it was potato chip.

3490
03:01:32,420 --> 03:01:33,340
Eat sugar.

3491
03:01:39,580 --> 03:01:40,560
She's so mean.

3492
03:01:43,720 --> 03:01:44,640
Brown box.

3493
03:01:47,280 --> 03:01:48,240
What did I just say?

3494
03:01:48,380 --> 03:01:48,840
I don't know.

3495
03:01:49,020 --> 03:01:49,280
Oh god.

3496
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:50,900
Table.

3497
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:53,460
Oh wait, sorry.

3498
03:01:53,720 --> 03:01:54,860
I meant not the table.

3499
03:01:55,140 --> 03:01:55,440
You know what?

3500
03:01:55,460 --> 03:01:55,800
It's fine.

3501
03:01:59,560 --> 03:02:00,860
Drink coffee.

3502
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:05,920
Drink coffee.

3503
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:10,980
Cardboard box.

3504
03:02:16,520 --> 03:02:17,080
Okay.

3505
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:19,560
Coffee bags.

3506
03:02:23,560 --> 03:02:26,340
The vocabulary in this game is so bizarre sometimes.

3507
03:02:27,140 --> 03:02:28,660
Why is it coffee bag?

3508
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:31,040
Why is it not just coffee?

3509
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:32,660
Okay, galley.

3510
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:37,700
We'll get the health behind the coffee bag.

3511
03:02:39,240 --> 03:02:42,740
And then we shall save and then we shall leave.

3512
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:45,020
Coffee bag.

3513
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:50,060
I said coffee earlier.

3514
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:51,000
It did not work.

3515
03:02:53,300 --> 03:02:55,060
Instead you must say coffee bag.

3516
03:02:56,540 --> 03:02:58,500
I don't know why you can't just say coffee.

3517
03:02:58,500 --> 03:02:59,740
Save point.

3518
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:02,680
The game is such an enigma.

3519
03:03:04,820 --> 03:03:06,100
It's the vocabulary.

3520
03:03:06,320 --> 03:03:08,180
Yeah, it gets me so bad sometimes.

3521
03:03:09,460 --> 03:03:12,220
Alright, we save and we go.

3522
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:15,100
We're going to the manager room.

3523
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:18,640
I don't know where that is but we're gonna go.

3524
03:03:18,920 --> 03:03:20,120
Wait, what was my health like?

3525
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,500
I actually didn't see.

3526
03:03:22,500 --> 03:03:23,240
Let's see.

3527
03:03:26,020 --> 03:03:29,040
There are bags inside but it is still confusing.

3528
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:34,920
I must become the mind of Rio to understand anything.

3529
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:38,180
She only understands very specific things.

3530
03:03:38,680 --> 03:03:38,840
Okay.

3531
03:03:39,560 --> 03:03:40,500
How many...

3532
03:03:41,260 --> 03:03:42,800
Oh, we got three health!

3533
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:44,180
That's not bad.

3534
03:03:44,240 --> 03:03:47,260
And our health, it could be better but if we die it's okay.

3535
03:03:47,820 --> 03:03:48,280
Androgoz!

3536
03:03:48,300 --> 03:03:49,300
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

3537
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:00,300
Hallway.

3538
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,500
Thank you for the 20 gifted Androgoz!

3539
03:04:03,540 --> 03:04:04,480
I really appreciate it.

3540
03:04:10,340 --> 03:04:13,860
Wait, what's happening?

3541
03:04:14,860 --> 03:04:17,760
Oh my gosh!

3542
03:04:18,700 --> 03:04:19,240
Gino!

3543
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:23,120
Oh my god!

3544
03:04:24,140 --> 03:04:24,380
Why?

3545
03:04:28,380 --> 03:04:30,880
Why is he so rough with her?

3546
03:04:32,300 --> 03:04:33,380
Revolver Ocelot!

3547
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:48,220
I don't think we need to introduce her.

3548
03:04:49,740 --> 03:04:50,180
Shoot!

3549
03:04:52,700 --> 03:04:54,260
Kick in the balls!

3550
03:04:58,040 --> 03:04:59,080
Kick balls!

3551
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:02,860
Punch!

3552
03:05:02,860 --> 03:05:02,900
Punch!

3553
03:05:12,220 --> 03:05:12,840
Kiss!

3554
03:05:16,300 --> 03:05:17,200
Low kick!

3555
03:05:17,720 --> 03:05:18,680
Oh my god!

3556
03:05:18,980 --> 03:05:20,900
I think we just game over.

3557
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:21,900
No!

3558
03:05:24,180 --> 03:05:24,800
No!

3559
03:05:24,900 --> 03:05:26,120
Rio you are CQC!

3560
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:29,360
Oh my god!

3561
03:05:29,400 --> 03:05:30,640
He is so scary!

3562
03:05:30,640 --> 03:05:34,020
Oh thank god we just saved.

3563
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:35,580
What the hell?

3564
03:05:35,880 --> 03:05:36,140
The

3565
03:05:42,500 --> 03:05:43,960
balls, what else is there?

3566
03:05:45,500 --> 03:05:47,260
What else could there be?

3567
03:05:48,180 --> 03:05:51,000
Okay, and he can't shoot him.

3568
03:05:51,940 --> 03:05:52,980
Red stomach.

3569
03:05:54,680 --> 03:05:56,320
Okay, hallway.

3570
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:58,520
Here we go.

3571
03:05:58,820 --> 03:05:59,040
Run?

3572
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:00,500
I don't think we can.

3573
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:02,160
He got us grabbed.

3574
03:06:02,620 --> 03:06:03,360
I'll try though.

3575
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:04,140
I'll try running.

3576
03:06:07,720 --> 03:06:09,660
Use your womanly charm.

3577
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:16,040
Number two in his mouth.

3578
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:22,400
No, my first order was shoot.

3579
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:25,300
Why are you dressed like that?

3580
03:06:25,720 --> 03:06:27,200
Sexy pose, Adriel.

3581
03:06:37,980 --> 03:06:40,000
He's scaring me.

3582
03:06:40,680 --> 03:06:42,660
He scares me.

3583
03:06:42,740 --> 03:06:44,160
Mao Mao, thanks for the five gifts.

3584
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:48,880
Sexy pose.

3585
03:06:52,140 --> 03:06:52,900
Run.

3586
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:57,940
Spit.

3587
03:07:01,660 --> 03:07:02,660
Push him.

3588
03:07:07,020 --> 03:07:08,460
Ask about stone.

3589
03:07:15,380 --> 03:07:17,280
I don't know.

3590
03:07:18,320 --> 03:07:19,420
Spin gun.

3591
03:07:20,500 --> 03:07:21,080
What?

3592
03:07:29,060 --> 03:07:31,380
She's like I need you to tell me what to do.

3593
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:34,280
I give you answers and you don't listen to any of them woman.

3594
03:07:34,780 --> 03:07:36,100
What do you want me to do?

3595
03:07:36,460 --> 03:07:39,040
This is like asking a girl what she wants for dinner.

3596
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:43,100
You want Wendy's?

3597
03:07:43,300 --> 03:07:44,020
I can't.

3598
03:07:44,620 --> 03:07:46,400
I'm not in the mood for burgers.

3599
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:47,700
Taco Bell.

3600
03:07:48,180 --> 03:07:50,580
No, I don't want tacos.

3601
03:07:54,260 --> 03:07:55,040
Threaten him.

3602
03:07:55,240 --> 03:07:56,100
Okay, we'll threaten him.

3603
03:07:56,320 --> 03:07:56,720
Hallway.

3604
03:07:56,720 --> 03:07:59,700
Leave the room?

3605
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:01,080
Okay.

3606
03:08:01,920 --> 03:08:02,600
Rio, shoot.

3607
03:08:02,960 --> 03:08:03,820
I can't do it.

3608
03:08:04,400 --> 03:08:05,340
It's no good.

3609
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:06,940
I can't do it.

3610
03:08:11,240 --> 03:08:12,840
The guide says threaten.

3611
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:14,100
Okay, thank you.

3612
03:08:14,380 --> 03:08:16,960
So you guys were serious when it said threaten.

3613
03:08:18,100 --> 03:08:19,500
I'm gonna need some more water in a bit.

3614
03:08:19,500 --> 03:08:22,140
Rio, what's going on?

3615
03:08:22,300 --> 03:08:23,680
Why are you dressed like that?

3616
03:08:24,280 --> 03:08:25,920
Gina, there's something I want you to see.

3617
03:08:26,040 --> 03:08:26,980
No, I can't do it.

3618
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:27,840
It's no good.

3619
03:08:28,940 --> 03:08:29,840
Can't do it.

3620
03:08:31,880 --> 03:08:34,300
So reference is a metal gear reference everybody.

3621
03:08:34,400 --> 03:08:34,700
I'm sorry.

3622
03:08:35,580 --> 03:08:37,180
Listen to me Rio.

3623
03:08:38,380 --> 03:08:40,060
Listen to me Rio.

3624
03:08:44,020 --> 03:08:45,220
Ask him about ligmar.

3625
03:08:46,220 --> 03:08:46,900
Threaten him.

3626
03:08:46,900 --> 03:08:49,180
Okay, I'll try that.

3627
03:08:53,480 --> 03:08:55,860
Drop your weapon.

3628
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:08,940
Thanks for 10 months.

3629
03:09:12,100 --> 03:09:12,620
Rio...

3630
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:15,360
Rio...

3631
03:09:15,700 --> 03:09:17,380
Why did you sound like that?

3632
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:19,980
You did sound more annoyed.

3633
03:09:20,220 --> 03:09:21,420
You sounded whiny baby.

3634
03:09:27,640 --> 03:09:31,220
I feel like if you said shoot, it should register as...

3635
03:09:31,220 --> 03:09:33,580
Oh yeah, I'll pretend... I'll act like I'm gonna shoot him.

3636
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:34,300
You know?

3637
03:09:35,300 --> 03:09:36,880
What's that blue ball?

3638
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:52,840
Spit it out.

3639
03:09:52,840 --> 03:09:55,640
Rio, you're not a...

3640
03:09:55,640 --> 03:10:03,360
The exhibit room is right down the hall.

3641
03:10:09,140 --> 03:10:10,220
What?

3642
03:10:16,320 --> 03:10:18,480
Oh damn.

3643
03:10:22,840 --> 03:10:24,980
Only the manager carries a key to the exhibit room.

3644
03:10:25,900 --> 03:10:29,240
Mr. Tanaka is under guard by the rescue team in the receiving board.

3645
03:10:31,240 --> 03:10:32,320
Okay, I'll spit it out.

3646
03:10:32,420 --> 03:10:33,440
Thank you.

3647
03:10:35,260 --> 03:10:37,140
December, do you remember?

3648
03:10:37,820 --> 03:10:39,200
Your information's old.

3649
03:10:46,660 --> 03:10:48,320
Okay, let's go operator.

3650
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:50,460
Your information's old.

3651
03:10:50,940 --> 03:10:55,920
I'm gonna start telling that to you guys when you tell me something that I should do in a game, but I've already tried it.

3652
03:10:57,900 --> 03:10:59,700
Your information's old.

3653
03:11:02,780 --> 03:11:04,140
That's crazy.

3654
03:11:07,820 --> 03:11:10,880
I guess, manager's office.

3655
03:11:14,620 --> 03:11:16,280
The backseating outdates.

3656
03:11:18,820 --> 03:11:19,440
Run.

3657
03:11:20,920 --> 03:11:22,160
Can we take his gun?

3658
03:11:22,220 --> 03:11:22,900
Do we need it?

3659
03:11:23,240 --> 03:11:24,300
I feel like ours is better.

3660
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:25,000
No?

3661
03:11:29,420 --> 03:11:30,340
She's running.

3662
03:11:30,540 --> 03:11:31,560
She's a running girl.

3663
03:11:31,740 --> 03:11:32,500
Running Rio.

3664
03:11:32,820 --> 03:11:34,960
And we get ambushed.

3665
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:36,400
Flee.

3666
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:39,940
Oh my gosh, this is the second one.

3667
03:11:40,400 --> 03:11:40,880
Enemy 2.

3668
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:42,600
Enemy 2.

3669
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:43,680
Flee.

3670
03:11:45,240 --> 03:11:47,420
Oh no, we're stuck in a small little area.

3671
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:48,300
Enemy 1.

3672
03:11:49,300 --> 03:11:49,860
In her mouth.

3673
03:11:50,140 --> 03:11:50,660
What?

3674
03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:51,160
There's more?

3675
03:11:52,900 --> 03:11:53,420
Tongue.

3676
03:11:54,740 --> 03:11:55,260
Body.

3677
03:11:56,260 --> 03:11:56,980
Flee.

3678
03:11:59,940 --> 03:12:00,560
Enemy 2.

3679
03:12:01,700 --> 03:12:02,140
Body.

3680
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:03,740
Front limb.

3681
03:12:04,740 --> 03:12:05,380
Hind limb.

3682
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:07,100
Hind limb.

3683
03:12:08,200 --> 03:12:08,620
Shoot.

3684
03:12:09,300 --> 03:12:10,000
Shoot.

3685
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:11,680
Shoot.

3686
03:12:12,340 --> 03:12:13,200
Shoot.

3687
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:17,440
Hind limb.

3688
03:12:18,840 --> 03:12:19,240
Shoot.

3689
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:20,920
Shoot.

3690
03:12:21,960 --> 03:12:22,640
Body.

3691
03:12:22,640 --> 03:12:22,720
Body.

3692
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:24,220
Body.

3693
03:12:26,780 --> 03:12:28,180
That works too.

3694
03:12:28,220 --> 03:12:28,540
Body.

3695
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:30,280
No.

3696
03:12:30,280 --> 03:12:30,880
Tongue.

3697
03:12:32,340 --> 03:12:33,180
Hind limb.

3698
03:12:33,540 --> 03:12:34,780
I don't think she can reach it.

3699
03:12:34,880 --> 03:12:35,280
In her mouth.

3700
03:12:36,160 --> 03:12:36,400
No.

3701
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:37,740
In her...

3702
03:12:37,740 --> 03:12:38,580
In her mouth.

3703
03:12:38,960 --> 03:12:39,900
In her mouth.

3704
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:45,260
In her mouth.

3705
03:12:46,460 --> 03:12:47,260
In her mouth.

3706
03:12:48,260 --> 03:12:49,760
In her mouth.

3707
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:50,580
In her mouth.

3708
03:12:54,290 --> 03:12:55,090
Recover.

3709
03:12:56,910 --> 03:12:57,710
Nice.

3710
03:12:57,870 --> 03:12:58,330
Enemy 1.

3711
03:12:58,810 --> 03:12:59,850
Front limb.

3712
03:13:01,790 --> 03:13:03,770
You didn't reload yet girl!

3713
03:13:04,250 --> 03:13:04,650
Reload.

3714
03:13:05,590 --> 03:13:06,210
Reload.

3715
03:13:07,170 --> 03:13:08,190
Jump back.

3716
03:13:09,050 --> 03:13:10,150
Jump back.

3717
03:13:10,750 --> 03:13:11,790
Jump back.

3718
03:13:12,550 --> 03:13:12,850
Run.

3719
03:13:15,260 --> 03:13:16,480
Oh my gosh.

3720
03:13:16,760 --> 03:13:17,200
Enemy 2.

3721
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:18,440
Hind limb.

3722
03:13:19,480 --> 03:13:19,860
Nice.

3723
03:13:20,900 --> 03:13:21,920
Enemy 3.

3724
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:23,900
Enemy 3.

3725
03:13:24,800 --> 03:13:25,180
Mouth.

3726
03:13:26,360 --> 03:13:26,880
Head.

3727
03:13:28,300 --> 03:13:28,720
Mouth.

3728
03:13:29,620 --> 03:13:30,180
Stomach.

3729
03:13:31,240 --> 03:13:31,620
Jump.

3730
03:13:32,340 --> 03:13:32,660
Stop.

3731
03:13:33,220 --> 03:13:33,480
Run!

3732
03:13:34,260 --> 03:13:35,600
God dammit Brio.

3733
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:36,340
What the fuck?

3734
03:13:36,540 --> 03:13:36,820
Mouth.

3735
03:13:37,860 --> 03:13:38,180
Stomach.

3736
03:13:47,740 --> 03:13:48,340
Body.

3737
03:13:49,300 --> 03:13:50,140
In her mouth.

3738
03:13:51,080 --> 03:13:51,520
Front limb.

3739
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:54,040
Body.

3740
03:13:55,160 --> 03:13:56,080
Tongue.

3741
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:58,620
Ok that works.

3742
03:13:59,080 --> 03:13:59,640
Enemy 3.

3743
03:14:00,220 --> 03:14:01,080
Stomach.

3744
03:14:01,980 --> 03:14:02,680
Mouth.

3745
03:14:02,920 --> 03:14:03,920
Mouth.

3746
03:14:04,620 --> 03:14:06,620
Oh my god.

3747
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:07,840
Mouth.

3748
03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:09,260
Mouth.

3749
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:10,560
Mouth.

3750
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:11,660
Shoot.

3751
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:13,040
Recover.

3752
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:14,620
Recover.

3753
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:17,520
She needs to...

3754
03:14:17,520 --> 03:14:18,360
Stomach.

3755
03:14:19,340 --> 03:14:19,780
Stomach.

3756
03:14:20,240 --> 03:14:21,440
Stomach.

3757
03:14:22,500 --> 03:14:22,980
Shoot.

3758
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:24,220
Shoot.

3759
03:14:24,580 --> 03:14:25,400
Shoot.

3760
03:14:25,800 --> 03:14:26,760
Shoot.

3761
03:14:27,060 --> 03:14:28,100
Shoot.

3762
03:14:28,980 --> 03:14:29,340
Reload.

3763
03:14:29,340 --> 03:14:30,280
Reload.

3764
03:14:31,660 --> 03:14:32,580
Dodge left.

3765
03:14:33,040 --> 03:14:33,680
Shoot.

3766
03:14:34,740 --> 03:14:35,380
Nice.

3767
03:14:35,500 --> 03:14:35,700
Ok.

3768
03:14:37,160 --> 03:14:38,240
Oh my gosh.

3769
03:14:38,380 --> 03:14:38,700
Body.

3770
03:14:40,680 --> 03:14:41,320
Nope.

3771
03:14:42,600 --> 03:14:44,440
How can I bait it over here?

3772
03:14:45,700 --> 03:14:48,380
I need to run behind it so we can get the hind limb.

3773
03:14:49,880 --> 03:14:50,520
Tongue.

3774
03:14:50,800 --> 03:14:51,040
Eye.

3775
03:14:51,980 --> 03:14:53,020
Oh nevermind.

3776
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:55,060
Oh my gosh.

3777
03:14:56,580 --> 03:14:57,060
Oh.

3778
03:14:59,060 --> 03:14:59,880
Auto fire?

3779
03:15:00,040 --> 03:15:01,860
I feel like she misses more with auto fire.

3780
03:15:02,040 --> 03:15:03,000
That's why I don't use it much.

3781
03:15:04,420 --> 03:15:05,320
Manager's office.

3782
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:08,100
Run.

3783
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:13,840
We only have one heal capsule left.

3784
03:15:18,020 --> 03:15:18,660
It's ok.

3785
03:15:18,720 --> 03:15:19,780
Our health is good at least.

3786
03:15:20,180 --> 03:15:20,640
Right now.

3787
03:15:20,960 --> 03:15:21,580
For now.

3788
03:15:22,260 --> 03:15:23,720
Oh I should save huh?

3789
03:15:24,420 --> 03:15:25,820
Oh my gosh.

3790
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:26,220
Too late.

3791
03:15:27,460 --> 03:15:28,020
Jump back!

3792
03:15:28,960 --> 03:15:29,680
Jump back!

3793
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:31,300
Oh my gosh.

3794
03:15:31,440 --> 03:15:32,080
We are so dead.

3795
03:15:32,280 --> 03:15:32,480
Nope.

3796
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:33,080
We are so dead.

3797
03:15:33,220 --> 03:15:33,640
Sorry.

3798
03:15:33,800 --> 03:15:34,140
Hold on.

3799
03:15:34,440 --> 03:15:34,660
Wait.

3800
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:35,720
What the heck is that thing?

3801
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:38,540
Oh this is the stomach creature.

3802

Because I used to be able to get it in the mouth and that would flip it upside down, but she won't shoot it in the mouth anymore.

4001
03:21:10,500 --> 03:21:11,480
I don't want to heal.

4002
03:21:11,560 --> 03:21:12,620
I only have one left.

4003
03:21:13,220 --> 03:21:14,540
I think I might have to though.

4004
03:21:15,820 --> 03:21:16,620
I think I might have to.

4005
03:21:16,780 --> 03:21:17,260
Recover.

4006
03:21:20,300 --> 03:21:20,780
Mouth.

4007
03:21:21,780 --> 03:21:22,260
Flee.

4008
03:21:26,340 --> 03:21:26,820
Mouth.

4009
03:21:28,780 --> 03:21:29,160
Mouth.

4010
03:21:30,880 --> 03:21:31,780
Oh, tail.

4011
03:21:33,120 --> 03:21:33,440
Flee.

4012
03:21:36,140 --> 03:21:36,620
Flee.

4013
03:21:37,320 --> 03:21:37,580
Yes.

4014
03:21:40,250 --> 03:21:40,990

4015
03:21:41,430 --> 03:21:41,770

Flee.

4022
03:21:55,690 --> 03:21:56,130
Flee.

4023
03:21:57,090 --> 03:21:59,230
I need you to run to the other side, Rio.

4024
03:22:00,070 --> 03:22:00,710
Red stomach.

4025
03:22:01,440 --> 03:22:02,290

4030
03:22:08,470 --> 03:22:09,190
Oh my god.

03:22:09,290 --> 03:22:09,470
Flee.

4032
03:22:09,890 --> 03:22:10,470
Oh my god.

4033
03:22:10,510 --> 03:22:11,530
We lost almost all the health.

4034
03:22:11,750 --> 03:22:12,570
Oh my god.

4035
03:22:13,270 --> 03:22:13,910
Red stomach.

4036
03:22:14,910 --> 03:22:16,150

4043
03:22:42,530 --> 03:22:43,730
Red stomach.

4044
03:22:45,970 --> 03:22:47,190
Red stomach.

4045
03:22:48,110 --> 03:22:49,010

Shoot.

4058
03:23:21,050 --> 03:23:22,230
I don't know what to do.

4059
03:23:22,510 --> 03:23:22,890
I don't...

4060
03:23:22,890 --> 03:23:23,230
Tail.

4061
03:23:23,930 --> 03:23:24,870
I don't know what to do.

4062
03:23:25,030 --> 03:23:25,310
Run.

4063
03:23:25,310 --> 03:23:25,590
Run.

4064
03:23:26,650 --> 03:23:27,010

4065
03:23:28,170 --> 03:23:28,870
Flee.

4066
03:23:30,610 --> 03:23:32,430
I don't know what to do.

4067

4068
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:47,200

4086
03:24:47,780 --> 03:24:48,460

4087

03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:55,100
Run.

4091
03:25:32,090 --> 03:25:32,770
Hallway.

4092
03:25:35,330 --> 03:25:35,890
Leave the room?

4093
03:25:36,830 --> 03:25:37,250
Okay.

4094
03:25:41,990 --> 03:25:46,050
When we get to the cutscene, I'm gonna go to get some more water since my throat hurts.

4095
03:25:48,210 --> 03:25:48,690
Oh!

4096
03:25:50,450 --> 03:25:50,490
Rio!

4097
03:25:51,230 --> 03:25:51,650
Gino!

4098
03:25:52,590 --> 03:25:54,530
What the hell are you doing here?

4099
03:25:55,450 --> 03:25:55,930
Wait!

4100
03:25:56,750 --> 03:25:58,330
Rio, what's going on?

4101
03:25:58,490 --> 03:25:59,830
Why are you dressed like that?

4102
03:26:00,350 --> 03:26:02,130
Gino, there's something I want you to see.

4103
03:26:02,930 --> 03:26:03,830
You're babbling.

4104
03:26:04,050 --> 03:26:04,730
Give me that weapon.

4105
03:26:05,930 --> 03:26:08,230
You should wait at the receiving port with the others.

4106
03:26:08,230 --> 03:26:08,530
Wait, listen!

4107
03:26:08,930 --> 03:26:09,890
I need you to watch this thing.

4108
03:26:09,910 --> 03:26:11,010
Listen to me, Rio.

4109
03:26:11,490 --> 03:26:13,230
You know I care about you.

4110
03:26:13,230 --> 03:26:17,110
Leave the dangerous stuff to me.

4111
03:26:17,430 --> 03:26:19,030
Take an escape shuttle out of here.

4112
03:26:20,230 --> 03:26:21,710
Hey, what should I do?

4113
03:26:22,450 --> 03:26:25,130
Why are you still- Okay, I'll try that.

4114
03:26:30,510 --> 03:26:31,070
Rio!

4115
03:26:47,280 --> 03:26:49,220
Put that in the drive and play it.

4116
03:27:12,430 --> 03:27:13,610
Get ready to stop.

4117
03:27:15,210 --> 03:27:15,850
There.

4118
03:27:16,890 --> 03:27:18,670
I need to know where this room is.

4119
03:27:19,790 --> 03:27:20,430
Here?

4120
03:27:20,890 --> 03:27:22,730
That's the, um...

4121
03:27:22,730 --> 03:27:24,130
Somewhere in the testing ward?

4122
03:27:24,650 --> 03:27:26,650
No, it's the, um...

4123
03:27:26,650 --> 03:27:27,450
exhibit room.

4124
03:27:28,490 --> 03:27:33,110
Rio, you're not a- The exhibit room is closed.

4125
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:35,710
There are gems and precious metals stored there.

4126
03:27:38,390 --> 03:27:39,850
So you're a thief?

4127
03:27:41,550 --> 03:27:44,210
This is some scam by you and that operator?

4128
03:27:45,730 --> 03:27:46,890
I suppose you're right.

4129
03:27:47,550 --> 03:27:49,150
In some ways, I guess I am a thief.

4130
03:27:50,230 --> 03:27:50,950
Please, Gino.

4131
03:27:51,510 --> 03:27:52,090
Turn around.

4132
03:27:54,970 --> 03:27:57,270
Rio, give up this crazy idea.

4133
03:27:57,430 --> 03:27:58,530
You can't do it anyways.

4134
03:27:58,850 --> 03:28:00,990
Only the manager carries a key to the exhibit room.

4135
03:28:01,910 --> 03:28:05,250
Mr. Tanaka is under guard by the rescue team in the receiving port.

4136
03:28:05,250 --> 03:28:06,070
Oh!

4137
03:28:13,150 --> 03:28:15,250
Your information's old.

4138
03:28:22,780 --> 03:28:24,320
Okay, let's go, operator.

4139
03:28:35,550 --> 03:28:36,930
Where should I go?

4140
03:28:56,320 --> 03:28:57,420
I am back.

4141
03:28:58,720 --> 03:29:00,000
I am back.

4142
03:29:01,760 --> 03:29:03,720
We will do this next fight.

4143
03:29:04,540 --> 03:29:06,200
Then we shall save.

4144
03:29:06,520 --> 03:29:08,340
Operator, what should I do?

4145
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:10,160
Oh...

4146
03:29:10,680 --> 03:29:13,640
Then we'll do the one by the manager's office.

4147
03:29:15,140 --> 03:29:16,100
Manager's office.

4148
03:29:20,440 --> 03:29:25,480
Now, at last, the one by the manager's office is annoying, but we shall persevere.

4149
03:29:27,500 --> 03:29:29,580
Oh, TV, table, tray, thanks for the cat.

4150
03:29:41,360 --> 03:29:43,200
When is it gonna happen?

4151
03:29:45,360 --> 03:29:46,720
We're almost there.

4152
03:29:47,880 --> 03:29:49,200
Oh, it happens right here.

4153
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:49,860
That's right.

4154
03:29:52,280 --> 03:29:52,820
Okay.

4155
03:29:54,800 --> 03:29:55,440
Ambush!

4156
03:29:59,200 --> 03:29:59,840
Flee!

4157
03:30:01,300 --> 03:30:02,820
Oh, that's right, there's two of them.

4158
03:30:03,760 --> 03:30:03,940
Flee!

4159
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:06,700
Enemy two.

4160
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:08,380
Front limb.

4161
03:30:09,700 --> 03:30:10,380
Body.

4162
03:30:11,140 --> 03:30:13,120
Oh, actually, it's pretty good.

4163
03:30:13,520 --> 03:30:13,980
Hind limb.

4164
03:30:15,900 --> 03:30:16,900
Inner mouth.

4165
03:30:18,140 --> 03:30:18,400
Nice.

4166
03:30:19,580 --> 03:30:20,280
Dodge right.

4167
03:30:21,340 --> 03:30:22,120
Oh, that worked.

4168
03:30:22,360 --> 03:30:22,760
Oh my gosh.

4169
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:23,460
Eye.

4170
03:30:24,840 --> 03:30:25,520
Body.

4171
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:28,840
Dodge right.

4172
03:30:30,340 --> 03:30:31,360
Enemy one.

4173
03:30:32,380 --> 03:30:32,960
Front limb.

4174
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:34,240
Nice.

4175
03:30:34,240 --> 03:30:36,360
Hind limb.

4176
03:30:38,460 --> 03:30:39,080
Flee.

4177
03:30:40,240 --> 03:30:42,060
Couldn't remember the word for that.

4178
03:30:43,600 --> 03:30:44,440
Hind limb.

4179
03:30:44,940 --> 03:30:45,520
Ah, shit.

4180
03:30:45,940 --> 03:30:46,420
Hind limb.

4181
03:30:47,560 --> 03:30:48,040
Flee.

4182
03:30:48,820 --> 03:30:49,420
No, no, no.

4183
03:30:49,460 --> 03:30:50,160
Flee, flee, flee.

4184
03:30:50,560 --> 03:30:50,780
Flee.

4185
03:30:53,920 --> 03:30:54,640

4187
03:31:00,760 --> 03:31:01,720
Inner mouth.

4188
03:31:02,580 --> 03:31:03,200
Flee.

4189
03:31:04,760 --> 03:31:05,720
Oh my gosh.

4190
03:31:06,080 --> 03:31:06,340
Flee.

4191
03:31:08,180 --> 03:31:09,780
Run fast.

4192
03:31:10,060 --> 03:31:10,520
Hind limb.

4193
03:31:14,410 --> 03:31:15,210
Flee.

4194
03:31:25,500 --> 03:31:25,780
Nice.

4195
03:31:26,080 --> 03:31:26,380
Recover.

4196
03:31:27,160 --> 03:31:27,860
Nope.

4197
03:31:28,300 --> 03:31:28,700
Recover.

4198
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:30,760
Why won't it hit sometimes?

4199
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:32,360
Because she's bad at aiming.

4200
03:31:32,640 --> 03:31:33,020
Recover.

4201
03:31:35,260 --> 03:31:35,640
Okay.

4204
03:31:40,360 --> 03:31:40,760
Mouth.

4205
03:31:41,500 --> 03:31:41,960
Shoot.

4206
03:31:42,900 --> 03:31:43,300
Shoot.

4207
03:31:43,780 --> 03:31:44,580

4208
03:31:44,580 --> 03:31:44,680
Shoot.

4209
03:31:45,660 --> 03:31:46,500
Shoot.

4210
03:31:48,180 --> 03:31:48,600

4211
03:31:49,760 --> 03:31:50,220
Shoot.

4212
03:31:52,620 --> 03:31:53,220
Strafe.

4213
03:31:55,080 --> 03:31:57,120
I don't think she hit a single one.

4214
03:31:58,820 --> 03:31:59,660
Stomach.

4215
03:32:00,660 --> 03:32:01,200

4217
03:32:05,740 --> 03:32:07,420
That one...

4218
03:32:07,420 --> 03:32:08,340
wasn't so bad.

4219
03:32:09,020 --> 03:32:09,980
We got through that.

4220
03:32:09,980 --> 03:32:13,700
Actually, I'm surprised I killed the first one so easily.

4221
03:32:14,320 --> 03:32:15,380
Break room.

4222
03:32:16,980 --> 03:32:17,580
Run.

4223
03:32:19,520 --> 03:32:20,660
Monotone the key.

4224
03:32:21,460 --> 03:32:24,580
Guys, please don't backstreet me on how to say things, please.

4225
03:32:24,880 --> 03:32:26,000
Please don't.

4226
03:32:26,420 --> 03:32:26,760
Please.

4227
03:32:27,100 --> 03:32:28,880
I try so many different ways.

4228
03:32:29,440 --> 03:32:29,840
Please.

4229
03:32:30,340 --> 03:32:33,440
My patience is already so thin.

4230
03:32:42,160 --> 03:32:43,200
Save point.

4231
03:32:59,610 --> 03:33:00,990
Let's do this one instead.

4232
03:33:02,270 --> 03:33:05,770
I still don't remember why I made a separate thing, but...

4233
03:33:07,790 --> 03:33:08,390
Alright.

4234
03:33:18,670 --> 03:33:21,450
Oh my gosh, I just realized he's still laying there.

4235
03:33:22,110 --> 03:33:22,930
What's his name?

4236
03:33:23,270 --> 03:33:23,750
Gio.

4237
03:33:26,810 --> 03:33:27,530
Gio.

4238
03:33:29,150 --> 03:33:30,050
Kill Gio.

4239
03:33:31,410 --> 03:33:33,610
Can we?

4240
03:33:34,690 --> 03:33:35,270
Oh my god.

4241
03:33:35,910 --> 03:33:36,610
Yamcha.

4242
03:33:37,010 --> 03:33:38,290
He's right there.

4243
03:33:40,870 --> 03:33:41,450
Oh, Gino.

4244
03:33:42,070 --> 03:33:44,390
Oops, I was getting his name wrong.

4245
03:33:47,010 --> 03:33:47,730
Hallway.

4246
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,230
Okay.

4247
03:33:49,210 --> 03:33:52,730
Okay, bye.

4248
03:33:58,140 --> 03:33:58,900
Alright.

4249
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:02,220
The next fight.

4250
03:34:05,880 --> 03:34:07,040
Manager's office.

4251
03:34:08,520 --> 03:34:08,620
Yes.

4252
03:34:10,160 --> 03:34:10,680
Run.

4253
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:13,300
Oh, she actually was running.

4254
03:34:13,420 --> 03:34:14,620
I didn't even need to tell her.

4255
03:34:14,620 --> 03:34:18,140
She was like, excuse me, I am running.

4256
03:34:18,480 --> 03:34:19,300
How dare you.

4257
03:34:19,580 --> 03:34:20,860
How dare you try to save.

4258
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:25,440
Oh, the other save was for seducing the monster lady.

4259
03:34:26,460 --> 03:34:27,420
Am I stupid?

4260
03:34:41,600 --> 03:34:42,320
Flee.

4261
03:34:43,660 --> 03:34:44,700

Don't run into them.

03:37:15,800 --> 03:37:17,640
I wonder what she's hearing.

I wonder what... I wonder what she hears instead.

4336
03:37:24,480 --> 03:37:25,080
Turn around!

4356
03:38:06,280 --> 03:38:06,580

03:38:33,400 --> 03:38:34,860
Okay, actually, this is fine.

4372
03:38:35,260 --> 03:38:35,520

Left stomach!

4379
03:38:52,810 --> 03:38:57,110
If she... If she makes it so that I can't shoot the mouth anymore, I might lose my mind.

4380
03:38:59,990 --> 03:39:03,010
If she makes it so I can't shoot the left stomach anymore...

4381
03:39:05,490 --> 03:39:06,870
Left stomach!

4382
03:39:09,570 --> 03:39:10,410

How many heal?

4386
03:39:17,270 --> 03:39:17,750
Oh my god.

4387
03:39:18,390 --> 03:39:19,010
Left stomach!

4388
03:39:21,030 --> 03:39:22,130
Left stomach!

4389
03:39:23,150 --> 03:39:23,890
Heal!

4390
03:39:24,770 --> 03:39:26,110
Actually, that works.

4391
03:39:26,510 --> 03:39:26,810
Recover!

4392
03:39:28,710 --> 03:39:29,910
Left stomach!

4393
03:39:31,790 --> 03:39:32,410
Left stomach!

4394
03:39:33,410 --> 03:39:34,850
Left stomach!

4395
03:39:36,010 --> 03:39:37,770
Left stomach!

4396
03:39:48,310 --> 03:39:49,370
Left stomach!

4397
03:39:53,670 --> 03:39:57,510
We can go...

4398
03:39:57,510 --> 03:39:58,270
Left stomach!

4399
03:39:59,110 --> 03:40:00,670
Left stomach!

4400
03:40:02,410 --> 03:40:05,410
Left stomach.

4401
03:40:07,310 --> 03:40:08,130
Mouth.

4402
03:40:09,130 --> 03:40:09,830
Shoot.

4403
03:40:11,090 --> 03:40:11,930
Red stomach.

4404
03:40:12,930 --> 03:40:14,050
Red stomach.

4405
03:40:16,110 --> 03:40:17,510
Mouth.

4406
03:40:18,750 --> 03:40:19,510
Mouth.

4407
03:40:20,190 --> 03:40:21,430
Red stomach.

4408
03:40:21,930 --> 03:40:23,150
Red stomach.

4409
03:40:26,250 --> 03:40:26,950
Mouth.

4410
03:40:28,030 --> 03:40:28,810
Mouth.

4411
03:40:30,210 --> 03:40:31,690
Oh no, it's gone.

4412
03:40:32,410 --> 03:40:32,510
Tail.

4413
03:40:33,270 --> 03:40:33,670
Flee.

4414
03:40:36,590 --> 03:40:37,390
Tail.

4415
03:40:38,190 --> 03:40:39,410
Red stomach.

4416
03:40:40,210 --> 03:40:41,070
Red stomach.

4417
03:40:43,010 --> 03:40:44,370
She's so ugly.

4418
03:40:44,650 --> 03:40:45,890
You are so ugly, Rio.

4419
03:40:46,310 --> 03:40:47,570
You are so fucking ugly.

4420
03:40:48,070 --> 03:40:48,310
Flee.

4421
03:40:50,030 --> 03:40:50,830
Flee.

4422
03:40:54,300 --> 03:40:54,680
Tail.

4423
03:40:55,480 --> 03:40:55,820
Tail.

4424
03:40:56,360 --> 03:40:57,160
Tail.

4425
03:40:57,980 --> 03:40:58,200
Tail.

4426
03:40:59,500 --> 03:40:59,780
Tail.

4427
03:41:00,700 --> 03:41:01,900
Red stomach.

4428
03:41:01,900 --> 03:41:03,720
Red stomach.

4429
03:41:14,990 --> 03:41:16,320
You know what, Rio?

4430
03:41:16,540 --> 03:41:17,600
Pretty girls listen.

4431
03:41:18,320 --> 03:41:19,620
Ugly girls don't listen.

4432
03:41:20,620 --> 03:41:21,520
That's why she's ugly.

4433
03:41:28,160 --> 03:41:28,960
Break room.

4434
03:41:30,420 --> 03:41:30,900
Run.

4435
03:41:32,900 --> 03:41:33,600
Oh my gosh.

4436
03:41:35,180 --> 03:41:36,360
Thank you for the tiny gift.

4437
03:41:41,140 --> 03:41:41,980
Ma'am

4438
03:41:52,370 --> 03:41:55,130
needs to go back to school.

4439
03:41:55,290 --> 03:41:57,630
She doesn't know the difference between a stomach and a mouth.

4440
03:42:01,450 --> 03:42:02,630
Thank you for the tiny gift.

4441
03:42:02,750 --> 03:42:04,150
Thank you so much.

4442
03:42:04,910 --> 03:42:05,630
Save point.

4443
03:42:09,850 --> 03:42:11,310
They are both red.

4444
03:42:12,770 --> 03:42:13,730
Shut up.

4445
03:42:13,990 --> 03:42:14,830
Shut up.

4446
03:42:16,950 --> 03:42:18,070
Oh my gosh.

4447
03:42:21,770 --> 03:42:22,750
Winds have changed.

4448
03:42:22,830 --> 03:42:23,670
Thanks for the ten gifted.

4449
03:42:24,450 --> 03:42:25,610
Thank you guys for all the gifted.

4450
03:42:28,970 --> 03:42:31,990
I think I only have one heal, but it is what it is.

4451
03:42:32,090 --> 03:42:33,610
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

4452
03:42:35,730 --> 03:42:36,730
We persevered.

4453
03:42:37,190 --> 03:42:38,910
We actually have full health basically.

4454
03:42:40,150 --> 03:42:40,650
How?

4455
03:42:40,930 --> 03:42:41,350
How?

4456
03:42:42,630 --> 03:42:43,870
Koyuki, thanks for the gifted.

4457
03:42:44,290 --> 03:42:44,730
Hallway.

4458
03:42:45,970 --> 03:42:47,390
I don't think Rio is ESL.

4459
03:42:47,610 --> 03:42:48,790
I think she is...

4460
03:42:51,490 --> 03:42:56,090
She is a girl who saw a blue ball on TV and decided to go to space.

4461
03:42:56,990 --> 03:42:59,610
I don't think we can ever understand her.

4462
03:43:00,510 --> 03:43:01,730
I don't think we can...

4463
03:43:01,730 --> 03:43:02,870
Johnny, thank you for the ten gifted.

4464
03:43:03,670 --> 03:43:04,250
Oh my gosh.

4465
03:43:04,650 --> 03:43:07,630
46, 62, 65, 68, 75, 42, 78.

4466
03:43:07,710 --> 03:43:08,430
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

4467
03:43:08,430 --> 03:43:11,330
Sorry, I couldn't say your whole name because it was cut off.

4468
03:43:12,330 --> 03:43:13,110
Manager's office.

4469
03:43:14,030 --> 03:43:16,390
I felt like I just read off some launch codes.

4470
03:43:20,330 --> 03:43:22,010
Why is everybody gifting so much?

4471
03:43:22,070 --> 03:43:22,590
Thank you.

4472
03:43:22,730 --> 03:43:24,310
Cleary, thank you so much for the ten gifted.

4473
03:43:25,330 --> 03:43:25,590
Ren.

4474
03:43:25,930 --> 03:43:26,330
Yes.

4475
03:43:27,250 --> 03:43:29,890
She is a girl who is just like...

4476
03:43:29,890 --> 03:43:32,150
Hey, I'm watching TV back home in my apartment.

4477
03:43:32,470 --> 03:43:33,050
Blue ball.

4478
03:43:33,650 --> 03:43:34,810
I gotta go to space.

4479
03:43:36,830 --> 03:43:37,950
Thanks for the ten gifted.

4480
03:43:38,590 --> 03:43:41,070
She did say her first word was...

4481
03:43:41,070 --> 03:43:42,710
How do you pronounce it again?

4482
03:43:45,910 --> 03:43:47,590
She's like, my favorite word is we.

4483
03:43:52,780 --> 03:43:53,700
Holy moly.

4484
03:43:53,800 --> 03:43:55,040
Hi, thank you for the ten gifted.

4485
03:43:57,160 --> 03:43:59,320
Rio here, sever your legs please, sir.

4486
03:44:00,360 --> 03:44:01,720
What does that mean?

4487
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:06,160
Oh my god.

4488
03:44:06,760 --> 03:44:08,500
He got evaporated.

4489
03:44:09,800 --> 03:44:11,180
Holy cow.

4490
03:44:13,220 --> 03:44:17,600
My man got obliterated to dust.

4491
03:44:20,400 --> 03:44:21,560
What the hell?

4492
03:44:23,900 --> 03:44:25,660
This place got torn the heck up.

4493
03:44:28,180 --> 03:44:30,040
He's running around naked.

4494
03:44:31,160 --> 03:44:31,460
What?

4495
03:44:31,580 --> 03:44:32,400
What's behind the couch?

4496
03:44:32,400 --> 03:44:34,400
Please, I just...

4497
03:44:37,040 --> 03:44:38,220
Mr. Tanaka?

4498
03:44:43,180 --> 03:44:43,880
I

4499
03:44:48,520 --> 03:44:50,380
think that's Mr. Tanaka.

4500
03:44:53,820 --> 03:44:56,300
I think that's...

4501
03:44:56,300 --> 03:44:57,440
Is this Mr. Tanaka?

4502
03:45:02,080 --> 03:45:04,180
Did he become the Hulk?

4503
03:45:07,040 --> 03:45:09,180
For someone...

4504
03:45:09,180 --> 03:45:09,820
Move!

4505
03:45:13,120 --> 03:45:14,520
Shoot!

4506
03:45:19,540 --> 03:45:20,940
Shoot!

4507
03:45:23,720 --> 03:45:24,420
Shoot!

4508
03:45:26,980 --> 03:45:32,890
There goes our full health.

4509
03:45:42,910 --> 03:45:44,330
Is this a boss fight?

4510
03:45:47,070 --> 03:45:48,090
Head!

4511
03:45:59,900 --> 03:46:00,800
Shoot!

4512
03:46:01,940 --> 03:46:02,400
Strafe!

4513
03:46:04,080 --> 03:46:05,480
Strafe!

4514
03:46:08,300 --> 03:46:09,700
Flee!

4515
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:12,040
Oh my gosh.

4516
03:46:13,360 --> 03:46:14,200
Strafe!

4517
03:46:16,640 --> 03:46:17,280
Strafe!

4518
03:46:19,320 --> 03:46:20,020
Nice.

4519
03:46:20,600 --> 03:46:20,860
Flee!

4520
03:46:21,960 --> 03:46:22,640
Reload!

4521
03:46:23,680 --> 03:46:25,260
Wait, you need to...

4522
03:46:25,260 --> 03:46:25,600
Flee!

4523
03:46:26,900 --> 03:46:27,580
Flee!

4524
03:46:28,140 --> 03:46:29,360
Oh, he does big damage.

4525
03:46:32,410 --> 03:46:33,830
We need to get behind him.

4526
03:46:34,050 --> 03:46:34,350
Tail!

4527
03:46:35,710 --> 03:46:36,390
Nice!

4528
03:46:37,350 --> 03:46:37,690
Head!

4529
03:46:39,010 --> 03:46:39,510
Uh-oh.

4530
03:46:39,770 --> 03:46:39,950
Flee!

4531
03:46:42,890 --> 03:46:43,570
Strafe!

4532
03:46:44,430 --> 03:46:45,210
Turn around?

4533
03:46:46,530 --> 03:46:47,210
Strafe?

4534
03:46:48,650 --> 03:46:49,330
Flee!

4535
03:46:49,830 --> 03:46:51,050
Oh, I'm so dead.

4536
03:46:51,230 --> 03:46:51,650
Dodge right.

4537
03:46:52,170 --> 03:46:53,150
Dodge right.

4538
03:46:53,150 --> 03:46:54,910
Dodge left?

4539
03:46:55,150 --> 03:46:55,530
We're dancing?

4540
03:46:58,290 --> 03:46:59,210
Dodge left?

4541
03:47:01,580 --> 03:47:02,140
Strafe?

4542
03:47:03,280 --> 03:47:03,520
Flee?

4543
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:05,700
Oh, we're so dead.

4544
03:47:10,870 --> 03:47:12,790
We did dodge that one at least.

4545
03:47:15,390 --> 03:47:16,550
That's so evil.

4546
03:47:16,770 --> 03:47:18,030
They give you two fights.

4547
03:47:18,890 --> 03:47:20,010
Two fights.

4548
03:47:20,630 --> 03:47:21,270
No heal.

4549
03:47:22,510 --> 03:47:23,790
One of them is okay.

4550
03:47:24,070 --> 03:47:26,570
One really annoying fight and then a boss fight.

4551
03:47:26,570 --> 03:47:29,570
With one heal in the break room.

4552
03:47:34,550 --> 03:47:35,870
That's so evil.

4553
03:47:39,890 --> 03:47:46,090
That's so evil and then also they got rid of some of my health in this cutscene.

4554
03:47:50,460 --> 03:47:51,120
Hallway.

4555
03:47:55,300 --> 03:47:57,720
This might be a Souls game.

4556
03:47:58,920 --> 03:48:00,640
This might be a Souls-like.

4557
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:03,920
This might be the hardest game ever to exist actually.

4558
03:48:08,280 --> 03:48:09,140
Exhibit room.

4559
03:48:09,820 --> 03:48:10,780
I give up.

4560
03:48:11,620 --> 03:48:11,920
You know what?

4561
03:48:11,940 --> 03:48:12,980
Let's go to another place.

4562
03:48:13,360 --> 03:48:13,620
Run.

4563
03:48:16,200 --> 03:48:17,180
Exhibit room.

4564
03:48:19,420 --> 03:48:19,940
Run.

4565
03:48:23,220 --> 03:48:27,040
This might be the most difficult game ever to ever exist.

4566
03:48:28,420 --> 03:48:30,940
It's the Dark Souls of voice control games.

4567
03:48:31,420 --> 03:48:36,420
I feel like, you know those people that play, that try and play games on DDR pads?

4568
03:48:36,860 --> 03:48:38,900
Even they would stray away from this game.

4569
03:48:40,300 --> 03:48:42,220
Even they would cower in fear.

4570
03:48:42,360 --> 03:48:43,300
They'd be like, Lifeline?

4571
03:48:43,300 --> 03:48:48,480
It sends a shiver up... wait, a chill up my spine.

4572
03:48:49,980 --> 03:48:51,220
They'd be like...

4573
03:48:52,180 --> 03:48:53,760
You couldn't tell me that.

4574
03:48:54,500 --> 03:48:55,500
Okay, dammit.

4575
03:48:55,660 --> 03:48:58,700
I was hoping that we could just avoid...

4576
03:48:58,700 --> 03:49:00,300
Manager's office.

4577
03:49:06,120 --> 03:49:12,320
Stay away from Lifeline like your lifeline depends on it.

4578
03:49:12,840 --> 03:49:14,880
Luckily I'm a ghost, so I'm already dead.

4579
03:49:15,220 --> 03:49:19,660
And if I were alive, I would wish that I were dead so I wouldn't have to play this game again.

4580
03:49:22,500 --> 03:49:25,540
I would wish for death if I were alive.

4581
03:49:25,880 --> 03:49:28,420
In fact, I wish I were alive so that I could die again.

4582
03:49:29,680 --> 03:49:30,080
Wow!

4583
03:49:34,960 --> 03:49:36,160
Thank you for the Haka-soba!

4584
03:49:36,280 --> 03:49:39,760
I don't know if you remember me from pre-graduating years ago since I barely could watch you before.

4585
03:49:40,140 --> 03:49:41,660
I also couldn't send any superchat on the time.

4586
03:49:42,080 --> 03:49:44,260
Even now I haven't been able to see your streams that often.

4587
03:49:44,460 --> 03:49:47,140
But I can now support you even if it's just...

4588
03:49:47,140 --> 03:49:49,140
This is way more than just a little bit.

4589
03:49:49,180 --> 03:49:51,940
You even donated a gift earlier.

4590
03:49:53,540 --> 03:49:54,760
Thank you so much!

4591
03:49:54,800 --> 03:49:56,840
Thanks for sticking around for so long too.

4592
03:49:56,840 --> 03:50:00,020
Thank you, it really means a lot.

4593
03:50:00,260 --> 03:50:01,480
I appreciate it so much.

4594
03:50:01,520 --> 03:50:02,520
Thank you!

4595
03:50:07,320 --> 03:50:08,280
An alien!

4596
03:50:14,630 --> 03:50:17,890
This is the room we might get stuck on for 5 hours.

4597
03:50:18,130 --> 03:50:18,890
I hope not though.

4598
03:50:22,030 --> 03:50:26,290
How many times are we going to see this cutscene after Zanzibar?

4599
03:50:27,250 --> 03:50:28,750
I warned him!

4600
03:50:29,110 --> 03:50:31,090
I warned him this would happen!

4601
03:50:34,750 --> 03:50:35,790
Yes you can!

4602
03:50:37,410 --> 03:50:38,070
Shoot!

4603
03:50:38,550 --> 03:50:39,050
Oh shoot!

4604
03:50:44,490 --> 03:50:45,150
Shoot!

4605
03:50:45,410 --> 03:50:47,440
Oh my god I didn't notice because she didn't say anything.

4606
03:50:49,410 --> 03:50:50,070
Shoot!

4607
03:50:50,470 --> 03:50:51,330
Oh my god!

4608
03:50:53,250 --> 03:50:53,910
Shoot!

4609
03:50:53,910 --> 03:50:54,130
Shoot!

4610
03:50:56,690 --> 03:50:57,150
Shoot!

4611
03:50:57,390 --> 03:50:58,090
What?

4612
03:50:58,490 --> 03:50:59,470
Girl what are you doing?

4613
03:51:03,510 --> 03:51:04,430
All

4614
03:51:14,540 --> 03:51:16,080
I said was sh...

4615
03:51:18,760 --> 03:51:21,380
Yeah, half a bar.

4616
03:51:21,580 --> 03:51:22,200
That's insane.

4617
03:51:22,680 --> 03:51:23,160
Strafe!

4618
03:51:26,000 --> 03:51:26,920
Flee!

4619
03:51:27,560 --> 03:51:28,140
Flee!

4620
03:51:29,320 --> 03:51:29,920
Flee!

4621
03:51:29,920 --> 03:51:30,060
Flee!

4622
03:51:32,860 --> 03:51:33,560
Strafe!

4623
03:51:35,920 --> 03:51:36,700
Reload!

4624
03:51:38,260 --> 03:51:38,960
Flee!

4625
03:51:40,720 --> 03:51:41,100
Flee!

4626
03:51:42,820 --> 03:51:43,880
Strafe!

4627
03:51:46,520 --> 03:51:47,500
Strafe!

4628
03:51:49,300 --> 03:51:50,740
Why don't you get the head?

4629
03:51:51,260 --> 03:51:51,540
Flee!

4630
03:51:53,320 --> 03:51:54,020
Flee!

4631
03:51:56,160 --> 03:51:56,900
Reload!

4632
03:51:58,600 --> 03:51:59,600
Reload!

4633
03:52:00,820 --> 03:52:01,480
Reload!

4634
03:52:04,560 --> 03:52:05,060
Head!

4635
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:07,760
Strafe!

4636
03:52:09,740 --> 03:52:10,160
Flee!

4637
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:14,400
The save point is right there mocking me.

4638
03:52:14,680 --> 03:52:15,120
Strafe!

4639
03:52:16,460 --> 03:52:17,140
Dodge left!

4640
03:52:20,500 --> 03:52:21,500
Flee!

4641
03:52:23,040 --> 03:52:23,900
Dodge left!

4642
03:52:43,340 --> 03:52:44,480
She even dodged.

4643
03:52:45,060 --> 03:52:47,120
I guess at the wrong time.

4644
03:52:53,060 --> 03:52:55,400
Does dodge only work as a command?

4645
03:52:56,320 --> 03:52:56,820
What do you mean?

4646
03:52:57,180 --> 03:52:58,180
Everything is a command?

4647
03:53:01,200 --> 03:53:01,800
Hallway.

4648
03:53:01,800 --> 03:53:01,880
Okay.

4649
03:53:05,440 --> 03:53:14,180
I'm gonna be staring directly at the talk thing so that I can minimize as much health as we can.

4650
03:53:16,940 --> 03:53:18,140
Manager's office.

4651
03:53:22,520 --> 03:53:23,300
Run.

4652
03:53:23,840 --> 03:53:24,980
I almost said flee.

4653
03:53:31,960 --> 03:53:34,420
Wait, did the launcher shells actually work?

4654
03:53:36,780 --> 03:53:38,820
The guide says to say shoot twice.

4655
03:53:40,440 --> 03:53:41,160
Wait, what?

4656
03:53:41,560 --> 03:53:42,380
In the second time?

4657
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:44,700
But I only did it once before.

4658
03:53:46,220 --> 03:53:46,920
Oh no, okay.

4659
03:53:47,100 --> 03:53:52,100
I think what it means is you say it twice, but she didn't understand me for some reason.

4660
03:53:53,500 --> 03:53:54,380
With launcher.

4661
03:53:55,120 --> 03:53:55,900
Okay, okay.

4662
03:53:56,140 --> 03:53:57,420
I will try it, I will try it.

4663
03:53:57,420 --> 03:54:04,680
So we'll get him, we'll get all the whatever, I'm assuming that is like armor around him or something.

4664
03:54:13,940 --> 03:54:15,660
She runs so funky.

4665
03:54:16,080 --> 03:54:19,940
She runs like Japanese JRPG, well that's redundant.

4666
03:54:20,820 --> 03:54:22,680
She runs like a JRPG heroine.

4667
03:54:23,060 --> 03:54:23,660
Truly.

4668
03:54:23,660 --> 03:54:30,800
Every girly pop runs like that in PS2 era JRPGs.

4669
03:54:34,560 --> 03:54:36,700
I just said ATM machine.

4670
03:54:38,560 --> 03:54:39,400
JJRPG.

4671
03:54:42,520 --> 03:54:43,360
I

4672
03:54:52,310 --> 03:54:53,610
warned him.

4673
03:54:54,390 --> 03:54:55,730
I warned him.

4674
03:54:56,770 --> 03:54:58,210
What did you warn him actually?

4675
03:54:58,630 --> 03:55:00,790
That he would die from alien?

4676
03:55:00,790 --> 03:55:02,570
Okay, here we go.

4677
03:55:11,410 --> 03:55:11,850
Shoot.

4678
03:55:17,530 --> 03:55:17,970
Shoot.

4679
03:55:19,530 --> 03:55:19,970
Nice!

4680
03:55:21,250 --> 03:55:22,770
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

4681
03:55:23,910 --> 03:55:26,270
Okay, we barely lost any health that time.

4682
03:55:26,450 --> 03:55:27,330
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

4683
03:55:28,270 --> 03:55:29,310
Good, good, good, good, good.

4684
03:55:31,230 --> 03:55:31,930
Okay.

4685
03:55:40,070 --> 03:55:40,710
Strafe!

4686
03:55:43,530 --> 03:55:44,230
Flee!

4687
03:55:46,650 --> 03:55:47,350
Strafe!

4688
03:55:48,910 --> 03:55:49,610
Strafe!

4689
03:55:50,770 --> 03:55:51,810
Reload!

4690
03:55:54,510 --> 03:55:55,210
No!

4691
03:56:00,010 --> 03:56:01,090
That was...

4692
03:56:01,850 --> 03:56:03,490
That was our last heal.

4693
03:56:16,180 --> 03:56:18,280
I didn't even say anything.

4694
03:56:28,730 --> 03:56:30,950
You can't even be mad about it.

4695
03:56:31,210 --> 03:56:32,230
I can only laugh.

4696
03:56:34,090 --> 03:56:36,370
Oh my god, Sakana!

4697
03:56:37,850 --> 03:56:38,650
Sakana!

4698
03:56:39,610 --> 03:56:47,030
Oh my gosh, you should have a group face connect play along of this game.

4699
03:56:48,230 --> 03:56:50,450
You should have a group playthrough.

4700
03:56:51,230 --> 03:56:52,950
Actually, you can join them.

4701
03:56:53,550 --> 03:56:54,630
You all play it.

4702
03:56:54,690 --> 03:56:56,390
Everybody passes off the mic.

4703
03:56:59,450 --> 03:57:02,290
Why are you sending me... Stop.

4704
03:57:08,990 --> 03:57:11,030
Tenma already played it?

4705
03:57:11,110 --> 03:57:11,730
Oh shoot.

4706
03:57:12,130 --> 03:57:13,330
Then she's exempt.

4707
03:57:13,870 --> 03:57:14,590
She's exempt.

4708
03:57:15,710 --> 03:57:17,010
She's been through hell.

4709
03:57:17,370 --> 03:57:18,890
Everybody must know this hell.

4710
03:57:18,990 --> 03:57:19,350
You know what?

4711
03:57:20,090 --> 03:57:22,230
If I... I changed my mind.

4712
03:57:22,570 --> 03:57:24,530
I want the world to burn.

4713
03:57:24,910 --> 03:57:27,250
If I go through hell, everybody else must go through hell.

4714
03:57:28,290 --> 03:57:31,850
Okay, okay.

4715
03:57:33,050 --> 03:57:33,570
Strafe!

4716
03:57:35,410 --> 03:57:35,930
Flee!

4717
03:57:36,870 --> 03:57:37,390
Run!

4718
03:57:38,530 --> 03:57:38,930
Flee!

4719
03:57:41,170 --> 03:57:42,130
I need his ass.

4720
03:57:42,850 --> 03:57:43,090
Flee!

4721
03:57:45,090 --> 03:57:46,730
Stop turning around.

4722
03:57:47,770 --> 03:57:48,290
Flee!

4723
03:57:50,230 --> 03:57:50,750
Flee!

4724
03:57:52,930 --> 03:57:53,450
Strafe!

4725
03:57:54,490 --> 03:57:54,990
Strafe!

4726
03:57:55,910 --> 03:57:56,130
No!

4727
03:57:57,650 --> 03:57:58,790
I need to bait him.

4728
03:57:59,770 --> 03:58:00,130
Flee!

4729
03:58:02,710 --> 03:58:03,230
Flee!

4730
03:58:04,370 --> 03:58:05,270
It's so scary.

4731
03:58:05,550 --> 03:58:05,890
Tail!

4732
03:58:07,330 --> 03:58:08,030
Damn it.

4733
03:58:08,290 --> 03:58:09,150
It's so scary.

4734
03:58:09,270 --> 03:58:09,550
Hold on.

4735
03:58:09,770 --> 03:58:11,210
Sorry, I've been pausing a lot today.

4736
03:58:11,430 --> 03:58:12,710
It's because I'm trying to explain my thoughts.

4737
03:58:12,710 --> 03:58:18,570
It's so scary trying to bait things because you never know if they're not going to understand you.

4738
03:58:19,450 --> 03:58:25,870
If they're not going to understand you and then everything that you try to do just is totally for nothing.

4739
03:58:26,930 --> 03:58:27,850
I'll suffer with you?

4740
03:58:27,990 --> 03:58:28,130
Okay.

4741
03:58:28,690 --> 03:58:29,250
Suffer.

4742
03:58:29,650 --> 03:58:31,530
Suffer like I have suffered!

4743
03:58:36,170 --> 03:58:36,730
Flee!

4744
03:58:39,170 --> 03:58:39,730
Flee!

4745
03:58:41,270 --> 03:58:41,510
Flee!

4746
03:58:42,710 --> 03:58:43,470
Tail!

4747
03:58:44,370 --> 03:58:44,830
Flee!

4748
03:58:48,470 --> 03:58:49,430
Reload!

4749
03:58:51,910 --> 03:58:53,310
Flee!

4750
03:58:55,550 --> 03:58:57,050
I can't get his butt!

4751
03:58:57,990 --> 03:58:58,470
Launcher!

4752
03:59:02,030 --> 03:59:03,430
Tail!

4753
03:59:04,570 --> 03:59:05,650
Launcher!

4754
03:59:07,930 --> 03:59:09,170
Does it do that much?

4755
03:59:09,290 --> 03:59:09,690
Strafe!

4756
03:59:12,250 --> 03:59:13,650
Launcher!

4757
03:59:15,070 --> 03:59:15,770
Launcher!

4758
03:59:19,930 --> 03:59:20,630
Reload!

4759
03:59:22,650 --> 03:59:23,350
Reload!

4760
03:59:26,150 --> 03:59:26,870
Strafe!

4761
03:59:28,890 --> 03:59:29,990
Dodge left!

4762
03:59:31,070 --> 03:59:32,490
Damn it.

4763
03:59:32,990 --> 03:59:33,290
Flee!

4764
03:59:37,270 --> 03:59:37,970
Strafe!

4765
03:59:40,150 --> 03:59:41,110
Dodge right!

4766
03:59:42,130 --> 03:59:42,850
Dodge right!

4767
03:59:43,830 --> 03:59:44,870
Dodge left!

4768
03:59:49,820 --> 03:59:50,740
Oh shit.

4769
03:59:52,580 --> 03:59:53,180
Reload!

4770
03:59:53,580 --> 03:59:54,400
Oh shit.

4771
03:59:55,620 --> 03:59:56,220
Flee!

4772
03:59:59,660 --> 04:00:00,260
Strafe!

4773
04:00:04,240 --> 04:00:04,840
Launcher!

4774
04:00:08,660 --> 04:00:09,260
Strafe!

4775
04:00:10,480 --> 04:00:11,660
I think we got him.

4776
04:00:13,320 --> 04:00:15,120
I have one bullet left but whatever.

4777
04:00:15,660 --> 04:00:16,280
I don't care.

4778
04:00:16,600 --> 04:00:17,120
I don't care.

4779
04:00:17,180 --> 04:00:17,700
It was worth it.

4780
04:00:22,130 --> 04:00:22,670
Oh my god.

4781
04:00:22,690 --> 04:00:23,590
He died on the close.

4782
04:00:23,770 --> 04:00:24,810
How poetic.

4783
04:00:26,930 --> 04:00:27,530
A win is a win.

4784
04:00:27,630 --> 04:00:28,170
I don't care.

4785
04:00:28,550 --> 04:00:29,290
I don't care!

4786
04:00:50,610 --> 04:00:51,650
President Suzuki.

4787
04:00:52,010 --> 04:00:52,390
Missing.

4788
04:00:53,290 --> 04:00:54,450
Reporter Helen Johnson.

4789
04:00:54,890 --> 04:00:55,230
Missing.

4790
04:00:55,910 --> 04:00:56,810
Senator Burton.

4791
04:00:57,410 --> 04:00:57,810
Missing.

4792
04:00:58,670 --> 04:00:59,230
Dr. Miller.

4793
04:00:59,630 --> 04:01:00,050
Missing.

4794
04:01:01,010 --> 04:01:02,750
Research Supervisor Joe Powers.

4795
04:01:03,470 --> 04:01:03,870
Missing.

4796
04:01:05,430 --> 04:01:06,850
In other words...

4797
04:01:07,550 --> 04:01:08,490
They're dead.

4798
04:01:08,610 --> 04:01:09,590
I just realized our health.

4799
04:01:09,810 --> 04:01:11,150
Holy cow!

4800
04:01:12,990 --> 04:01:13,790
We...

4801
04:01:13,790 --> 04:01:16,450
The exhibit room's key should be in here somewhere.

4802
04:01:17,210 --> 04:01:18,050
Where should I start looking?

4803
04:01:18,050 --> 04:01:18,990
We lucked out.

4804
04:01:19,590 --> 04:01:21,210
We lucked out for real.

4805
04:01:21,990 --> 04:01:23,050
She sells...

4806
04:01:24,090 --> 04:01:26,290
First time tongue twisters.

4807
04:01:26,650 --> 04:01:29,450
Yeah, because someone used our last health.

4808
04:01:33,390 --> 04:01:33,850
Okay.

4809
04:01:37,050 --> 04:01:37,650
What?

4810
04:01:38,970 --> 04:01:39,230
Uh oh.

4811
04:01:40,050 --> 04:01:42,270
The boot black brought the boot back.

4812
04:01:43,330 --> 04:01:44,490
Wait, I don't have my list.

4813
04:01:44,670 --> 04:01:44,930
Oh no.

4814
04:01:45,190 --> 04:01:46,030
Wait, don't say anything.

4815
04:01:46,390 --> 04:01:46,790
No!

4816
04:01:46,790 --> 04:01:47,730
Oh, I got it.

4817
04:01:47,810 --> 04:01:47,890
Okay.

4818
04:01:51,730 --> 04:01:52,170
Okay.

4819
04:01:55,310 --> 04:01:57,210
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

4820
04:01:57,630 --> 04:01:59,030
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

4821
04:02:00,350 --> 04:02:01,850
Yeah, Alan is the one...

4822
04:02:01,850 --> 04:02:03,690
Yeah, he's playing dead in the honeymoon suite.

4823
04:02:03,830 --> 04:02:04,210
Yeah, yeah.

4824
04:02:06,690 --> 04:02:07,750
A woodchuck could chuck wood.

4825
04:02:08,010 --> 04:02:10,870
A woodchuck would chuck as much as he could chuck if a woodchuck could.

4826
04:02:12,350 --> 04:02:13,410
Okay, your turn.

4827
04:02:14,390 --> 04:02:17,110
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

4828
04:02:17,430 --> 04:02:20,290
A woodchuck would chuck as much as it could chuck if a woodchuck could.

4829
04:02:20,790 --> 04:02:21,310
Not bad.

4830
04:02:21,410 --> 04:02:24,830
And wasn't the president and his wife in that room as well earlier?

4831
04:02:25,930 --> 04:02:26,390
I think so.

4832
04:02:29,210 --> 04:02:29,650
Okay.

4833
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:32,290
Yeah, so there's...

4834
04:02:32,290 --> 04:02:34,870
I think he just didn't know who all was missing and who all...

4835
04:02:35,630 --> 04:02:35,970
Yeah.

4836
04:02:36,790 --> 04:02:37,410
She sells.

4837
04:02:38,510 --> 04:02:39,630
I can't believe...

4838
04:02:40,470 --> 04:02:42,690
I can't believe she used her last health.

4839
04:02:42,830 --> 04:02:43,610
I can't believe it.

4840
04:02:43,830 --> 04:02:44,130
Yes.

4841
04:02:46,930 --> 04:02:48,710
I almost wish I could redo the fight.

4842
04:02:50,530 --> 04:02:51,830
I almost wish I could redo the fight.

4843
04:02:51,990 --> 04:02:53,290
I mean, I could, but I don't want to.

4844
04:02:54,010 --> 04:02:55,450
Rubber baby buggy bumper.

4845
04:02:56,590 --> 04:02:57,370
She got hungry.

4846
04:02:59,830 --> 04:03:00,890
Ah, so true.

4847
04:03:01,490 --> 04:03:03,370
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

4848
04:03:03,830 --> 04:03:05,210
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

4849
04:03:06,890 --> 04:03:07,650
Okay, your turn.

4850
04:03:08,470 --> 04:03:10,230
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

4851
04:03:10,710 --> 04:03:12,170
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

4852
04:03:12,750 --> 04:03:13,190
Awesome!

4853
04:03:13,390 --> 04:03:14,270
Oh, I thought I...

4854
04:03:14,270 --> 04:03:15,670
I bit my tongue on that one.

4855
04:03:15,770 --> 04:03:16,930
I didn't think I was going to get it.

4856
04:03:18,270 --> 04:03:23,350
She stood on the balcony inexplicably mimicking him hiccuping and amicably welcoming him in.

4857
04:03:24,830 --> 04:03:25,790
Okay, your turn.

4858
04:03:26,810 --> 04:03:32,990
She stood on the balcony inexplicably mimicking him hiccuping and amicably welcoming him in.

4859
04:03:35,170 --> 04:03:37,370
I didn't think I would get that one.

4860
04:03:41,560 --> 04:03:43,770
I didn't think I would get that one.

4861
04:03:44,450 --> 04:03:48,050
Let's go to full health since the game is getting much tougher.

4862
04:03:48,590 --> 04:03:49,610
She sells.

4863
04:03:50,470 --> 04:03:52,170
And since we don't have any heals...

4864
04:03:52,790 --> 04:03:53,370
Yes.

4865
04:03:56,410 --> 04:03:58,010
Let's start with an easy one.

4866
04:03:58,930 --> 04:04:00,970
The boot black brought the boot back.

4867
04:04:02,230 --> 04:04:03,190
Okay, your turn.

4868
04:04:04,370 --> 04:04:06,410
The boot black brought the boot back.

4869
04:04:06,850 --> 04:04:07,290
Awesome.

4870
04:04:07,650 --> 04:04:08,130
Awesome.

4871
04:04:08,670 --> 04:04:10,130
As long as we don't get the Esaw.

4872
04:04:10,150 --> 04:04:10,670
Repeat after me.

4873
04:04:10,810 --> 04:04:12,090
Esaw, she saw...

4874
04:04:12,090 --> 04:04:13,430
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

4875
04:04:13,610 --> 04:04:14,990
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

4876
04:04:15,250 --> 04:04:16,770
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't Fuzzy Wuzzy.

4877
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:18,730
I like this one.

4878
04:04:18,750 --> 04:04:19,290
Okay, your turn.

4879
04:04:20,330 --> 04:04:21,510
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

4880
04:04:21,830 --> 04:04:22,950
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

4881
04:04:23,270 --> 04:04:24,770
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't Fuzzy Wuzzy.

4882
04:04:25,790 --> 04:04:27,790
Nice try, but you blew it.

4883
04:04:30,630 --> 04:04:30,630
What?

4884
04:04:30,990 --> 04:04:32,070
No I didn't.

4885
04:04:35,440 --> 04:04:36,440
She sells.

4886
04:04:38,280 --> 04:04:39,920
So you want to play Tongue Twister with me?

4887
04:04:42,460 --> 04:04:43,020
Yes.

4888
04:04:44,800 --> 04:04:46,160
Let's start with an easy one.

4889
04:04:47,020 --> 04:04:47,580
What?

4890
04:04:47,700 --> 04:04:49,840
Pick up six pick up sticks quickly.

4891
04:04:51,120 --> 04:04:52,100
Okay, your turn.

4892
04:04:52,160 --> 04:04:52,760
I missed a word.

4893
04:04:53,160 --> 04:04:55,680
Pick up six pick up sticks quickly.

4894
04:04:55,680 --> 04:04:58,020
I've missed words before though.

4895
04:04:58,580 --> 04:05:00,080
Repeat after me.

4896
04:05:01,320 --> 04:05:03,420
A noise annoys an oyster.

4897
04:05:04,180 --> 04:05:06,520
But a noisy noise annoys an oyster more.

4898
04:05:07,500 --> 04:05:08,960
Okay, your turn.

4899
04:05:09,980 --> 04:05:11,600
A noise annoys an oyster.

4900
04:05:11,900 --> 04:05:14,660
But a noisy noise annoys an oyster more.

4901
04:05:15,060 --> 04:05:15,540
Awesome.

4902
04:05:15,920 --> 04:05:16,380
Awesome.

4903
04:05:16,480 --> 04:05:17,040
Good evening Mento.

4904
04:05:17,200 --> 04:05:18,320
Good morning.

4905
04:05:18,360 --> 04:05:19,020
Repeat after me.

4906
04:05:19,360 --> 04:05:20,100
Good morning Mento.

4907
04:05:20,640 --> 04:05:21,960
I saw Esaw kissing Kate.

4908
04:05:22,220 --> 04:05:22,800
Kate saw.

4909
04:05:22,880 --> 04:05:23,680
I saw Esaw.

4910
04:05:23,900 --> 04:05:25,220
Esaw saw that I saw Kate kissing Esaw.

4911
04:05:25,220 --> 04:05:27,280
Cosmically funny that it's like OMG great.

4912
04:05:27,420 --> 04:05:28,420
We got past the cutscene with almost...

4913
04:05:28,420 --> 04:05:29,000
Okay, your turn.

4914
04:05:30,780 --> 04:05:32,080
I saw Esaw kissing Kate.

4915
04:05:32,320 --> 04:05:32,720
Kate saw.

4916
04:05:32,800 --> 04:05:33,540
I saw Esaw.

4917
04:05:33,780 --> 04:05:35,120
Esaw saw that I saw Kate.

4918
04:05:35,240 --> 04:05:35,660
And Kate saw.

4919
04:05:35,740 --> 04:05:36,480
I saw Esaw.

4920
04:05:37,380 --> 04:05:37,780
Never.

4921
04:05:38,220 --> 04:05:38,880
I don't...

4922
04:05:38,880 --> 04:05:40,680
I have never ever gotten that one.

4923
04:05:40,900 --> 04:05:41,140
Ever.

4924
04:05:41,440 --> 04:05:42,300
Every single one.

4925
04:05:47,900 --> 04:05:48,700
She sells.

4926
04:05:50,680 --> 04:05:52,280
So you want to play Tongue Twister with me?

4927
04:05:52,300 --> 04:05:54,180
Immediately pops the last medkit to get the 2%.

4928
04:05:54,180 --> 04:05:54,540
I know.

4929
04:05:54,540 --> 04:05:55,460
Yes.

4930
04:05:57,300 --> 04:05:58,220
Let's start with an easy one.

4931
04:05:58,220 --> 04:06:00,020
It is cosmically funny, huh?

4932
04:06:00,160 --> 04:06:02,260
Pick up 6 pick up sticks quickly.

4933
04:06:03,560 --> 04:06:04,540
Okay, your turn.

4934
04:06:05,180 --> 04:06:07,600
Pick up 6 pick up sticks quickly.

4935
04:06:08,020 --> 04:06:08,460
Awesome.

4936
04:06:10,940 --> 04:06:12,060
Repeat after me.

4937
04:06:13,600 --> 04:06:14,680
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

4938
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:16,180
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

4939
04:06:16,580 --> 04:06:18,080
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?

4940
04:06:19,520 --> 04:06:20,520
Okay, your turn.

4941
04:06:21,660 --> 04:06:22,900
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.

4942
04:06:23,160 --> 04:06:24,300
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

4943
04:06:24,300 --> 04:06:26,120
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?

4944
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:26,960
Good.

4945
04:06:28,340 --> 04:06:29,620
Repeat after me.

4946
04:06:30,620 --> 04:06:36,160
She stood on the balcony inexplicably mimicking him hiccuping and amicably welcoming him in.

4947
04:06:37,480 --> 04:06:38,600
Okay, your turn.

4948
04:06:39,880 --> 04:06:44,660
She stood on the balcony inexplicably mimicking him hiccuping and amicably welcoming him in.

4949
04:06:45,100 --> 04:06:45,600
Awesome.

4950
04:06:47,300 --> 04:06:48,920
Okay, I think one more.

4951
04:06:49,480 --> 04:06:49,980
No, you did it.

4952
04:06:50,180 --> 04:06:50,620
Thanks.

4953
04:06:52,060 --> 04:06:52,980
I really needed that.

4954
04:06:54,500 --> 04:06:57,200
I'm gonna be a tongue twister master by this game.

4955
04:06:58,260 --> 04:06:59,220
She sells.

4956
04:07:01,020 --> 04:07:01,580
I feel like I'm...

4957
04:07:01,580 --> 04:07:02,700
So you wanna play tongue twister with me?

4958
04:07:02,760 --> 04:07:03,420
I feel like I'm...

4959
04:07:04,100 --> 04:07:04,480
Yes.

4960
04:07:05,540 --> 04:07:06,760
Very good at that one.

4961
04:07:06,800 --> 04:07:07,000
Let's start with an easy one.

4962
04:07:07,020 --> 04:07:09,400
I feel like that one is almost ASMR.

4963
04:07:09,720 --> 04:07:10,400
Pick up 6 pick up sticks quickly.

4964
04:07:10,420 --> 04:07:11,220
The balcony one.

4965
04:07:11,480 --> 04:07:12,840
It has like a nice like...

4966
04:07:12,840 --> 04:07:13,440
Okay, your turn.

4967
04:07:13,440 --> 04:07:14,720
Clicky sound to each word.

4968
04:07:15,360 --> 04:07:17,660
Pick up 6 pick up sticks quickly.

4969
04:07:18,100 --> 04:07:18,520
Awesome.

4970
04:07:21,060 --> 04:07:22,020
Repeat after me.

4971
04:07:23,400 --> 04:07:25,600
She sells seashells on the seashore.

4972
04:07:26,380 --> 04:07:28,600
Seashells she sells are seashells she is sure.

4973
04:07:30,160 --> 04:07:31,280
Okay, your turn.

4974
04:07:32,360 --> 04:07:34,080
She sells seashells on the seashore.

4975
04:07:34,640 --> 04:07:37,220
Seashells she sells are seashells she is sure.

4976
04:07:37,820 --> 04:07:38,260
Awesome.

4977
04:07:40,480 --> 04:07:41,760
Repeat after me.

4978
04:07:41,960 --> 04:07:46,080
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

4979
04:07:46,340 --> 04:07:49,130
A woodchuck would chuck as much as it could if a woodchuck could...

4980
04:07:49,130 --> 04:07:50,770
Wood, chuck, wood, wood, wood, wood.

4981
04:07:51,230 --> 04:07:51,630
Okay, your turn.

4982
04:07:56,430 --> 04:07:56,950
Good!

4983
04:08:02,570 --> 04:08:03,850
Wow, you did it!

4984
04:08:03,930 --> 04:08:05,770
I had to stop myself from laughing.

4985
04:08:06,110 --> 04:08:06,870
I really needed that.

4986
04:08:07,570 --> 04:08:09,730
I can't ever get to the second part of that one.

4987
04:08:10,290 --> 04:08:11,770
Okay, uh...

4988
04:08:11,770 --> 04:08:12,490
Save point.

4989
04:08:12,950 --> 04:08:15,310
I can't ever get it.

4990
04:08:15,690 --> 04:08:16,810
I can't do it.

4991
04:08:17,590 --> 04:08:18,070
Okay.

4992
04:08:27,610 --> 04:08:29,390
Let's do the second break room.

4993
04:08:30,250 --> 04:08:30,490
One.

4994
04:08:39,070 --> 04:08:39,790
Let's see.

4995
04:08:40,730 --> 04:08:42,470
I'm gonna see how much we have left of the game.

4996
04:08:44,730 --> 04:08:46,450
We're so close, aren't we?

4997
04:08:47,090 --> 04:08:47,810
Oh yeah, we are.

4998
04:08:47,910 --> 04:08:51,470
One, two, three, four...

4999
04:08:52,610 --> 04:08:53,830
Five more areas.

5000
04:08:53,970 --> 04:08:54,510
That's it.

5001
04:08:56,630 --> 04:08:58,050
Oh no, there's a bed in here.

5002
04:08:58,770 --> 04:08:59,730
Hotel registry.

5003
04:09:06,090 --> 04:09:08,490
So after the next room, it will be...

5004
04:09:08,490 --> 04:09:09,870
Yeah, we go to the next room.

5005
04:09:12,470 --> 04:09:13,330
Yeah, no shit.

5006
04:09:14,770 --> 04:09:15,370
Nyaru too!

5007
04:09:15,510 --> 04:09:16,750
Thank you for the break!

5008
04:09:17,410 --> 04:09:17,990
Thank you, thank you!

5009
04:09:23,190 --> 04:09:24,810
Is the registry paper?

5010
04:09:25,810 --> 04:09:26,810
Oh yeah!

5011
04:09:27,850 --> 04:09:30,610
We used up most of ours, so this is good actually.

5012
04:09:33,990 --> 04:09:36,210
Hey Nyaru, you should play this game too.

5013
04:09:36,890 --> 04:09:38,110
Uh, desk.

5014
04:09:39,050 --> 04:09:40,250
Murphy, thanks for the 10 gifted!

5015
04:09:40,890 --> 04:09:42,170
Robert, thanks for the 5 gifted!

5016
04:09:42,390 --> 04:09:43,650
Icky, thanks for the 2 gifted!

5017
04:09:44,190 --> 04:09:45,410
Spank, thanks for the 20 gifted!

5018
04:09:46,570 --> 04:09:47,370
Ducky, thanks for the gift!

5019
04:09:47,890 --> 04:09:48,390
Okay.

5020
04:09:50,510 --> 04:09:51,010
Screen.

5021
04:09:53,010 --> 04:09:53,870
Yes I do.

5022
04:09:54,970 --> 04:09:55,350
Monitor.

5023
04:09:57,710 --> 04:09:58,470
Standby mode.

5024
04:09:58,670 --> 04:09:59,850
Space station, overall map.

5025
04:10:00,550 --> 04:10:01,470
Check monitor.

5026
04:10:03,110 --> 04:10:03,610
Monitor.

5027
04:10:03,610 --> 04:10:06,930
It's showing...

5028
04:10:06,930 --> 04:10:08,250
It's showing...

5029
04:10:08,250 --> 04:10:08,850
Your mom.

5030
04:10:09,330 --> 04:10:10,650
Couple, thanks for the 5 gifted!

5031
04:10:11,070 --> 04:10:12,410
I can't believe that worked earlier.

5032
04:10:12,570 --> 04:10:14,930
I can't believe I said your mom and it registered that.

5033
04:10:16,190 --> 04:10:17,630
I'll never get over it.

5034
04:10:17,950 --> 04:10:18,630
Check papers.

5035
04:10:20,390 --> 04:10:21,750
Yeah, there's a lot of them.

5036
04:10:23,310 --> 04:10:23,850
Document.

5037
04:10:24,350 --> 04:10:24,690
Document.

5038
04:10:27,950 --> 04:10:29,810
Check document on floor.

5039
04:10:34,270 --> 04:10:35,290
Hmm.

5040
04:10:43,730 --> 04:10:44,750
Okay.

5041
04:10:46,190 --> 04:10:48,070
Check chair document.

5042
04:10:50,970 --> 04:10:51,950
But there's a document there.

5043
04:10:55,810 --> 04:10:58,950
Oh, I think it's the same thing.

5044
04:10:59,760 --> 04:11:01,330
Check desk document.

5045
04:11:03,450 --> 04:11:04,770
Appreciate your tenacity.

5046
04:11:04,930 --> 04:11:06,230
I would have given up a long time ago.

5047
04:11:06,310 --> 04:11:06,930
Minky's strong.

5048
04:11:07,690 --> 04:11:09,530
Well, that's what I do.

5049
04:11:10,190 --> 04:11:11,710
Check document on desk.

5050
04:11:12,310 --> 04:11:13,970
I'm not a quitter, usually.

5051
04:11:16,270 --> 04:11:17,790
I'm no quitter, usually.

5052
04:11:21,590 --> 04:11:24,750
446620 Take document on desk.

5053
04:11:24,750 --> 04:11:27,750
It has several numbers scribbled on it.

5054
04:11:29,470 --> 04:11:30,150
Hello!

5055
04:11:32,990 --> 04:11:33,670
Hello, hello.

5056
04:11:34,170 --> 04:11:35,210
No, we're not quitters.

5057
04:11:35,590 --> 04:11:37,070
We have to see this through to the end.

5058
04:11:37,230 --> 04:11:37,710
For real.

5059
04:11:38,790 --> 04:11:40,750
Why is the shower booth in the...

5060
04:11:42,470 --> 04:11:43,150
Bedroom.

5061
04:11:45,190 --> 04:11:46,230
Shower booth.

5062
04:11:47,330 --> 04:11:48,370
That's curious.

5063
04:11:49,990 --> 04:11:50,670
Curious.

5064
04:11:51,670 --> 04:11:52,350
Curious.

5065
04:11:52,350 --> 04:11:53,270
Red.

5066
04:11:55,090 --> 04:11:56,730
Step all over his clothes.

5067
04:11:56,910 --> 04:11:59,230
His steaming, stinky...

5068
04:11:59,230 --> 04:12:00,410
Clothes on the ground.

5069
04:12:01,170 --> 04:12:02,350
And it's see-through.

5070
04:12:05,870 --> 04:12:06,970
Oh, nice.

5071
04:12:09,230 --> 04:12:09,830
Nice,

5072
04:12:14,210 --> 04:12:14,670
nice, nice.

5073
04:12:15,010 --> 04:12:16,730
How many do we have now of those?

5074
04:12:19,750 --> 04:12:20,350
Three.

5075
04:12:20,670 --> 04:12:20,910
Okay.

5076
04:12:23,230 --> 04:12:23,710
Bed.

5077
04:12:25,250 --> 04:12:26,590
Oh, her favorite place.

5078
04:12:27,210 --> 04:12:28,890
Rio wants me so bad.

5079
04:12:28,970 --> 04:12:30,710
Hello everybody who came in.

5080
04:12:31,610 --> 04:12:36,250
This is a game, if you couldn't tell, where it is all voice controlled and it's very frustrating.

5081
04:12:38,830 --> 04:12:42,610
Yup, we're doing our best.

5082
04:12:42,710 --> 04:12:43,790
We're doing our best.

5083
04:12:44,170 --> 04:12:44,490
Safe.

5084
04:12:47,170 --> 04:12:48,910
Basically, we're in space and...

5085
04:12:49,910 --> 04:12:51,910
Aliens started attacking.

5086
04:12:56,690 --> 04:12:57,690
And...

5087
04:12:57,690 --> 04:12:59,530
And...

5088
04:12:59,530 --> 04:13:00,450
Yeah.

5089
04:13:03,890 --> 04:13:04,850
Oh, wait.

5090
04:13:06,070 --> 04:13:07,970
Can that be...

5091
04:13:07,970 --> 04:13:09,430
Yeah, we have the numbers.

5092
04:13:10,090 --> 04:13:12,290
We have the...

5093
04:13:12,290 --> 04:13:13,310
Bookshelf.

5094
04:13:14,310 --> 04:13:17,350
Encyclopedias and accounting documents.

5095
04:13:17,790 --> 04:13:21,050
So we're trying to figure out what happened in the space station, basically.

5096
04:13:21,590 --> 04:13:23,190
Check above bookshelf.

5097
04:13:25,910 --> 04:13:26,990
Yeah.

5098
04:13:28,150 --> 04:13:30,910
Search above bookshelf.

5099
04:13:34,150 --> 04:13:36,450
Look above bookshelf.

5100
04:13:38,230 --> 04:13:40,130
No, there's not, Rio.

5101
04:13:41,810 --> 04:13:43,170
Top of bookshelf.

5102
04:13:46,790 --> 04:13:49,870
How does it feel to yell top at me and that doesn't work?

5103
04:13:51,330 --> 04:13:53,710
You yell, you say top, Vtuber.

5104
04:13:54,450 --> 04:13:56,270
Say top of bookshelf instead.

5105
04:13:56,650 --> 04:13:57,590
And it didn't work.

5106
04:13:58,230 --> 04:13:59,750
How does it feel?

5107
04:13:59,890 --> 04:14:02,530
How does it feel to be so confident and be so wrong?

5108
04:14:07,490 --> 04:14:08,450
Top Rio.

5109
04:14:08,450 --> 04:14:09,990
Top Rio.

5110
04:14:11,210 --> 04:14:12,470
She's confused.

5111
04:14:13,310 --> 04:14:14,590
She doesn't understand.

5112
04:14:14,950 --> 04:14:15,230
TV.

5113
04:14:16,650 --> 04:14:17,510
Yeah, what is that?

5114
04:14:18,810 --> 04:14:19,670
Check monitor.

5115
04:14:21,230 --> 04:14:21,530
Yeah.

5116
04:14:25,830 --> 04:14:30,230
Wait, from the monitor room?

5117
04:14:31,030 --> 04:14:32,270
No, that's not our room.

5118
04:14:33,370 --> 04:14:35,930
It feels a lot like you feel talking to Rio.

5119
04:14:35,930 --> 04:14:37,450
What do you mean?

5120
04:14:38,410 --> 04:14:38,990
Backseating?

5121
04:14:44,480 --> 04:14:45,720
But I'm right.

5122
04:14:48,320 --> 04:14:49,260
I'm right.

5123
04:14:50,120 --> 04:14:51,260
What are you talking about?

5124
04:14:52,160 --> 04:14:52,920
I'm correct.

5125
04:14:53,060 --> 04:14:55,920
You guys are the ones saying say this instead and it's wrong.

5126
04:14:56,100 --> 04:14:56,880
Which one should I check?

5127
04:14:57,500 --> 04:14:57,820
Book.

5128
04:14:58,360 --> 04:14:59,120
Do you mean that?

5129
04:14:59,400 --> 04:14:59,660
Yeah.

5130
04:14:59,660 --> 04:14:59,760
Yeah.

5131
04:15:07,200 --> 04:15:09,300
Read notebook.

5132
04:15:17,440 --> 04:15:19,340
That's... check bed.

5133
04:15:23,440 --> 04:15:25,000
Look under sheets.

5134
04:15:25,500 --> 04:15:26,280
Yeah.

5135
04:15:30,280 --> 04:15:31,900
Oh my gosh, she actually listened.

5136
04:15:32,900 --> 04:15:33,960
She listened.

5137
04:15:34,380 --> 04:15:34,920
Sexy pose?

5138
04:15:35,260 --> 04:15:36,340
Do a sexy pose.

5139
04:15:41,660 --> 04:15:45,480
What does she mean by that?

5140
04:15:45,940 --> 04:15:47,000
Amputated leg, sir?

5141
04:15:47,740 --> 04:15:50,420
It's the greatest day from a Homestar thing.

5142
04:15:50,680 --> 04:15:50,860
What?

5143
04:15:50,980 --> 04:15:52,080
I don't remember that at all.

5144
04:15:54,180 --> 04:15:56,020
Do a sexy pose.

5145
04:15:56,020 --> 04:15:57,000
Suicide.

5146
04:15:57,800 --> 04:15:58,740
Don't be stupid.

5147
04:15:58,880 --> 04:16:00,080
There are people who are counting on us.

5148
04:16:00,180 --> 04:16:02,120
She doesn't understand sexiness anymore.

5149
04:16:02,820 --> 04:16:03,040
No.

5150
04:16:04,440 --> 04:16:05,360
Let's see.

5151
04:16:07,920 --> 04:16:09,900
Search above bookshelf.

5152
04:16:10,660 --> 04:16:12,600
There were only encyclopedias and documents.

5153
04:16:13,500 --> 04:16:15,100
Top of bookshelf.

5154
04:16:16,020 --> 04:16:18,120
There were only encyclopedias and documents.

5155
04:16:19,240 --> 04:16:20,240
We got a teacher.

5156
04:16:21,020 --> 04:16:22,380
Do a double peace sign.

5157
04:16:22,920 --> 04:16:23,560
Peace, peace.

5158
04:16:34,710 --> 04:16:36,670
Check behind photos.

5159
04:16:36,790 --> 04:16:38,050
It's a men's bathrobe.

5160
04:16:38,750 --> 04:16:40,610
I think the manager was using it.

5161
04:16:42,870 --> 04:16:44,070
Behind photos.

5162
04:16:44,690 --> 04:16:45,370
Do you mean that?

5163
04:16:49,350 --> 04:16:50,550
Behind cards?

5164
04:16:50,910 --> 04:16:51,710
Do you mean that?

5165
04:16:54,670 --> 04:16:55,870
Above bookshelf.

5166
04:16:56,590 --> 04:16:58,330
There were only encyclopedias and documents.

5167
04:17:00,930 --> 04:17:02,530
On top of bookshelf.

5168
04:17:02,530 --> 04:17:02,550
On top of bookshelf.

5169
04:17:03,230 --> 04:17:05,410
There were only encyclopedias and documents.

5170
04:17:05,410 --> 04:17:05,510
There were only encyclopedias and documents.

5171
04:17:07,770 --> 04:17:09,890
You missed the sexy pose you can grab from the bookshelf.

5172
04:17:12,710 --> 04:17:13,110
You missed the sexy pose you can grab from the bookshelf.

5173
04:17:13,110 --> 04:17:13,130
Wait.

5174
04:17:13,250 --> 04:17:14,630
If you missed the sexy pose you...

5175
04:17:14,630 --> 04:17:14,750
Oh.

5176
04:17:15,030 --> 04:17:17,010
If you missed the sexy pose you can grab it from the bookshelf.

5177
04:17:17,110 --> 04:17:18,610
Right now this item can't be grabbed.

5178
04:17:18,850 --> 04:17:19,750
But it's shiny.

5179
04:17:24,400 --> 04:17:26,040
Miku-chan, I already tried.

5180
04:17:26,140 --> 04:17:27,820
Search on top of bookshelf, please.

5181
04:17:27,820 --> 04:17:28,180
Please.

5182
04:17:36,360 --> 04:17:38,260
But it's shiny.

5183
04:17:38,400 --> 04:17:40,080
Shouldn't I still be able to grab it?

5184
04:17:43,820 --> 04:17:45,920
Chat has old information.

5185
04:17:53,980 --> 04:17:55,640
Look at photos.

5186
04:17:55,820 --> 04:17:56,780
That's a good suggestion.

5187
04:17:56,780 --> 04:17:57,900
It's a men's bathrobe.

5188
04:17:58,480 --> 04:18:00,080
I think the manager was using it.

5189
04:18:00,140 --> 04:18:01,680
Is it really that we can't grab it?

5190
04:18:01,880 --> 04:18:03,240
Even though...

5191
04:18:03,240 --> 04:18:04,780
Even though it's shiny?

5192
04:18:05,000 --> 04:18:07,940
I feel like if we had gotten it before...

5193
04:18:07,940 --> 04:18:09,360
It shouldn't be there then, right?

5194
04:18:12,920 --> 04:18:14,840
Right, I feel...

5195
04:18:18,330 --> 04:18:20,770
I feel like it wouldn't be shiny otherwise.

5196
04:18:25,430 --> 04:18:27,130
Look at this photograph.

5197
04:18:27,130 --> 04:18:27,970
Grab...

5198
04:18:27,970 --> 04:18:30,130
Every time I want to grab...

5199
04:18:30,130 --> 04:18:31,410
Grab photos.

5200
04:18:31,990 --> 04:18:33,750
Grab photos.

5201
04:18:35,090 --> 04:18:37,510
I think if I mention photos...

5202
04:18:37,510 --> 04:18:39,490
She only talks about the bathroom.

5203
04:18:41,590 --> 04:18:43,190
What does GameFAQ say?

5204
04:18:43,370 --> 04:18:44,050
That's a great question.

5205
04:18:44,730 --> 04:18:45,150
Let's check.

5206
04:18:45,770 --> 04:18:49,370
We are in the manager's office.

5207
04:18:54,010 --> 04:18:55,010
Let's see.

5208
04:18:55,790 --> 04:18:56,430
Notebook.

5209
04:19:02,330 --> 04:19:03,970
It doesn't say!

5210
04:19:04,070 --> 04:19:04,710
No way!

5211
04:19:10,440 --> 04:19:11,340
It doesn't say!

5212
04:19:12,120 --> 04:19:13,520
But also, was that the final?

5213
04:19:16,300 --> 04:19:17,580
It says...

5214
04:19:17,580 --> 04:19:20,440
It says tell her to check...

5215
04:19:20,440 --> 04:19:22,140
The pillow for the final chip.

5216
04:19:22,920 --> 04:19:24,640
I don't think we got the final...

5217
04:19:24,640 --> 04:19:26,420
I think I must have missed some chips.

5218
04:19:26,720 --> 04:19:28,060
No way!

5219
04:19:30,180 --> 04:19:32,840
Did I miss some chips?

5220
04:19:42,600 --> 04:19:43,200
Okay.

5221
04:19:48,760 --> 04:19:49,640
Open the safe.

5222
04:19:53,480 --> 04:19:54,700
Does that get us the bad end?

5223
04:19:57,720 --> 04:19:58,700
Yeah, I know.

5224
04:19:58,700 --> 04:19:59,520
Hold on.

5225
04:19:59,580 --> 04:20:00,500
I'm not good with these.

5226
04:20:03,360 --> 04:20:04,040
Oh.

5227
04:20:04,840 --> 04:20:05,300
Four.

5228
04:20:09,160 --> 04:20:10,000
Uh-huh.

5229
04:20:10,280 --> 04:20:10,840
Okay.

5230
04:20:13,520 --> 04:20:14,200
Yeah.

5231
04:20:17,500 --> 04:20:18,180
Six.

5232
04:20:21,420 --> 04:20:22,880
Is the last one two?

5233
04:20:26,390 --> 04:20:26,990
Wait.

5234
04:20:27,310 --> 04:20:28,130
Oh, it still worked.

5235
04:20:28,130 --> 04:20:29,710
Is that okay?

5236
04:20:31,150 --> 04:20:31,510
Two.

5237
04:20:33,890 --> 04:20:34,830
I don't know.

5238
04:20:35,110 --> 04:20:35,230
Oh!

5239
04:20:41,410 --> 04:20:42,010
Guys?

5240
04:20:44,590 --> 04:20:45,550
Wait a second.

5241
04:20:46,210 --> 04:20:46,490
Wait!

5242
04:20:46,710 --> 04:20:47,690
Just a hot minute.

5243
04:20:51,390 --> 04:20:53,050
Oh, you have to say four right.

5244
04:20:53,510 --> 04:20:54,390
Oh my gosh.

5245
04:20:54,450 --> 04:20:54,650
Okay.

5246
04:20:55,250 --> 04:20:56,150
Four right.

5247
04:20:58,130 --> 04:21:00,210
And then you have to say six left.

5248
04:21:01,650 --> 04:21:02,450
Okay.

5249
04:21:02,990 --> 04:21:03,250
Okay.

5250
04:21:03,930 --> 04:21:05,030
Six left.

5251
04:21:07,890 --> 04:21:08,290
Wait.

5252
04:21:08,510 --> 04:21:09,450
I think you went the wrong way.

5253
04:21:09,990 --> 04:21:10,270
No!

5254
04:21:10,730 --> 04:21:11,050
Rio!

5255
04:21:12,350 --> 04:21:13,930
You did it wrong!

5256
04:21:16,750 --> 04:21:18,110
Two left.

5257
04:21:20,130 --> 04:21:20,930
Two.

5258
04:21:29,130 --> 04:21:30,910
Yeah, you blew it Rio.

5259
04:21:31,170 --> 04:21:33,230
You blew it.

5260
04:21:33,230 --> 04:21:34,510
Four right.

5261
04:21:37,110 --> 04:21:37,410
Yes.

5262
04:21:43,910 --> 04:21:46,470
Six left.

5263
04:21:50,490 --> 04:21:51,770
Nice.

5264
04:21:54,190 --> 04:21:55,030
Nice.

5265
04:21:57,330 --> 04:21:59,010
Two right.

5266
04:22:01,670 --> 04:22:02,050
Yay!

5267
04:22:03,730 --> 04:22:04,770
We got it.

5268
04:22:06,050 --> 04:22:06,650
It opened.

5269
04:22:08,510 --> 04:22:09,350
Nice.

5270
04:22:11,050 --> 04:22:12,530
Rob him of all his worth.

5271
04:22:16,290 --> 04:22:18,430
Rob him for all his worth!

5272
04:22:22,610 --> 04:22:24,230
What is this disc?

5273
04:22:26,170 --> 04:22:28,090
It says lost and found on it.

5274
04:22:28,470 --> 04:22:30,170
It belongs to...

5275
04:22:30,170 --> 04:22:31,050
Alan Honda.

5276
04:22:32,090 --> 04:22:33,010
Hang on a minute.

5277
04:22:36,830 --> 04:22:37,790
She's zooming.

5278
04:22:38,630 --> 04:22:38,810
Go.

5279
04:22:39,110 --> 04:22:39,610
Go Rio.

5280
04:22:39,730 --> 04:22:39,890
Go.

5281
04:22:40,090 --> 04:22:41,090
Oh, I found a player.

5282
04:22:41,730 --> 04:22:43,670
This will let us watch that disc we found.

5283
04:22:45,090 --> 04:22:45,430
Good.

5284
04:22:45,870 --> 04:22:46,670
It doesn't appear to be broken.

5285
04:22:46,670 --> 04:22:48,770
We are still watching DVDs.

5286
04:22:51,050 --> 04:22:54,010
Maybe we went in a circle.

5287
04:22:54,530 --> 04:22:56,030
Maybe DVDs are trendy again.

5288
04:22:56,350 --> 04:22:58,050
So that's why we watch them.

5289
04:22:58,150 --> 04:22:59,450
Everybody wants physical media.

5290
04:23:00,090 --> 04:23:02,910
So in 2030, we all return to physical media.

5291
04:23:03,090 --> 04:23:05,770
What is that?

5292
04:23:06,510 --> 04:23:08,050
That says project Rio.

5293
04:23:08,250 --> 04:23:09,110
She can't listen.

5294
04:23:17,710 --> 04:23:18,490
I'm sorry.

5295
04:23:18,770 --> 04:23:21,190
Is the blue ball the Philosopher's Stone?

5296
04:23:35,230 --> 04:23:37,330
We are in FMA now.

5297
04:23:41,610 --> 04:23:42,650
This is it.

5298
04:23:55,550 --> 04:23:57,530
They made a bootleg.

5299
04:24:02,090 --> 04:24:04,830
They made a bootleg.

5300
04:24:05,010 --> 04:24:07,610
They made a bootleg.

5301
04:24:11,670 --> 04:24:13,390
That's different.

5302
04:24:20,410 --> 04:24:21,810
That's...

5303
04:24:44,170 --> 04:24:49,890
This very stone has been spared in order that your country may carry out its plan of battle.

5304
04:24:50,150 --> 04:24:52,850
And we believe that this is the only...

5305
04:24:52,850 --> 04:24:52,950
They made...

5306
04:24:53,690 --> 04:24:55,550
Oh my god!

5307
04:24:57,250 --> 04:24:58,850
It... Oh my god!

5308
04:25:01,170 --> 04:25:02,830
Have I been fighting flowers?

5309
04:25:04,290 --> 04:25:05,270
Joseph Craft?

5310
04:25:10,810 --> 04:25:13,310
Corrupt living creatures with curses.

5311
04:25:13,510 --> 04:25:15,070
We had WMD and a Stalin.

5312
04:25:18,290 --> 04:25:19,530
What do you mean just as I thought?

5313
04:25:22,390 --> 04:25:24,550
It was all baloney.

5314
04:25:25,670 --> 04:25:26,730
Load of malarkey.

5315
04:25:28,430 --> 04:25:28,830
Yeah!

5316
04:25:29,530 --> 04:25:30,010
Kill him!

5317
04:25:31,170 --> 04:25:32,290
We should curse him.

5318
04:25:33,670 --> 04:25:34,810
We have to curse him with the stone.

5319
04:25:37,010 --> 04:25:38,250
Curse him with the stone!

5320
04:25:41,670 --> 04:25:43,110
Guys, this is so bad.

5321
04:25:43,190 --> 04:25:45,870
We are about to go into a final boss fight.

5322
04:25:45,870 --> 04:25:48,750
We are so close to a final boss fight and we have no health.

5323
04:25:50,790 --> 04:25:51,590
Oh no!

5324
04:25:52,470 --> 04:25:53,570
This is so bad.

5325
04:25:55,190 --> 04:25:55,910
Save point.

5326
04:25:58,490 --> 04:25:59,950
What about the shiny thing?

5327
04:26:00,010 --> 04:26:00,870
I think I'm gonna give up.

5328
04:26:02,010 --> 04:26:02,410
It's ok.

5329
04:26:03,650 --> 04:26:05,030
I didn't even get all the chips.

5330
04:26:06,670 --> 04:26:07,870
I didn't get all the chips, so...

5331
04:26:09,010 --> 04:26:09,890
Do you have a heal?

5332
04:26:09,990 --> 04:26:10,370
I don't.

5333
04:26:10,590 --> 04:26:11,950
She used the last one.

5334
04:26:13,850 --> 04:26:15,350
She used the last one.

5335
04:26:17,050 --> 04:26:20,690
In the last battle we just did.

5336
04:26:21,450 --> 04:26:23,050
When she didn't even need it.

5337
04:26:25,570 --> 04:26:26,770
She used it.

5338
04:26:27,510 --> 04:26:29,070
I wonder what all the chips do.

5339
04:26:29,190 --> 04:26:32,270
I think maybe they unlock something in the...

5340
04:26:32,270 --> 04:26:34,210
In the...

5341
04:26:35,230 --> 04:26:36,690
Extras menu is what I'm assuming.

5342
04:26:36,890 --> 04:26:38,150
I actually have no idea what they do.

5343
04:26:39,310 --> 04:26:42,190
Pull out a fuzzy wuzzy mid-combat, I wish.

5344
04:26:43,050 --> 04:26:44,710
Ok, we checked the shower booth.

5345
04:26:44,830 --> 04:26:47,150
We do have...

5346
04:26:48,250 --> 04:26:49,230
Three launcher grenades.

5347
04:26:49,450 --> 04:26:50,950
So that's pretty huge, I'm not gonna lie.

5348
04:26:51,270 --> 04:26:51,870
Look at that!

5349
04:26:52,090 --> 04:26:54,330
We were one chip away!

5350
04:26:56,090 --> 04:26:58,250
A trendy and popular collectible item.

5351
04:26:58,350 --> 04:27:00,250
Something happens every time four chips are collected.

5352
04:27:02,030 --> 04:27:03,670
We were one chip away.

5353
04:27:04,450 --> 04:27:05,990
Where did I miss it?

5354
04:27:06,950 --> 04:27:07,990
No way!

5355
04:27:08,770 --> 04:27:09,770
Where would it be?

5356
04:27:14,770 --> 04:27:15,790
Where would it be?

5357
04:27:16,850 --> 04:27:19,130
I feel like I... I don't think it's the bookshelf.

5358
04:27:23,290 --> 04:27:23,810
Check...

5359
04:27:23,810 --> 04:27:25,290
The shiny is the last one.

5360
04:27:25,530 --> 04:27:27,570
No, I think that's a... I mean...

5361
04:27:28,730 --> 04:27:31,370
I will satiate everybody's...

5362
04:27:31,370 --> 04:27:32,010
If I'm wrong?

5363
04:27:32,190 --> 04:27:32,710
Awesome.

5364
04:27:33,950 --> 04:27:34,990
But... Bed.

5365
04:27:34,990 --> 04:27:35,590
Hello?

5366
04:27:36,770 --> 04:27:38,070
If I'm wrong, that's great.

5367
04:27:38,090 --> 04:27:39,870
But I think it's a command ticket.

5368
04:27:40,070 --> 04:27:41,430
I don't think it's a chip.

5369
04:27:43,310 --> 04:27:45,270
The bookshelf is a camera check command.

5370
04:27:45,590 --> 04:27:45,870
See?

5371
04:27:46,370 --> 04:27:47,530
It's a command ticket.

5372
04:27:47,670 --> 04:27:49,110
It's not a chip, you guys.

5373
04:27:53,350 --> 04:27:55,330
But I'll satiate your curiosity.

5374
04:27:58,330 --> 04:27:59,350
What is this anyway?

5375
04:28:00,870 --> 04:28:02,570
Product is not registered equipment.

5376
04:28:05,750 --> 04:28:06,430
How many chips?

5377
04:28:06,510 --> 04:28:08,270
I have 15 out of 16 in the game.

5378
04:28:08,710 --> 04:28:10,330
I don't know where I missed it though.

5379
04:28:17,540 --> 04:28:18,620
Check pictures.

5380
04:28:18,820 --> 04:28:19,980
Oh, maybe check pictures.

5381
04:28:20,680 --> 04:28:22,240
Check behind pictures.

5382
04:28:23,300 --> 04:28:23,860
Nope.

5383
04:28:24,380 --> 04:28:25,500
Check pictures.

5384
04:28:28,720 --> 04:28:29,280
Stop.

5385
04:28:29,700 --> 04:28:30,020
Stop.

5386
04:28:31,280 --> 04:28:31,820
Yeah, I know.

5387
04:28:34,780 --> 04:28:35,340
Bookshelf.

5388
04:28:38,500 --> 04:28:38,920
Bed.

5389
04:28:43,440 --> 04:28:45,520
And we received a chip in the room from the bed.

5390
04:28:45,640 --> 04:28:46,300
It seems unlikely.

5391
04:28:46,380 --> 04:28:47,180
Yeah, I think...

5392
04:28:47,180 --> 04:28:49,200
You guys, I can even tell from the coloring.

5393
04:28:50,420 --> 04:28:52,020
That it's a command thing.

5394
04:28:52,400 --> 04:28:52,880
I give up.

5395
04:28:53,600 --> 04:28:53,940
Leave.

5396
04:28:57,040 --> 04:28:57,980
No, leave.

5397
04:28:58,400 --> 04:28:59,740
It does look like a nice bed though.

5398
04:29:00,440 --> 04:29:00,860
Leave.

5399
04:29:05,260 --> 04:29:05,680
Hallway.

5400
04:29:07,320 --> 04:29:07,600
Hallway.

5401
04:29:12,680 --> 04:29:13,200
Run.

5402
04:29:15,500 --> 04:29:16,900
I just don't know.

5403
04:29:16,960 --> 04:29:18,700
I feel like I've been so thorough with checking.

5404
04:29:20,460 --> 04:29:21,200
Categories game.

5405
04:29:21,300 --> 04:29:22,260
Rio picks up a category.

5406
04:29:23,420 --> 04:29:25,100
The first person to miss loses.

5407
04:29:26,520 --> 04:29:27,620
Where should I go?

5408
04:29:28,440 --> 04:29:29,280
Exhibit room.

5409
04:29:29,720 --> 04:29:30,500
The exhibit room.

5410
04:29:30,860 --> 04:29:31,040
Okay.

5411
04:29:31,900 --> 04:29:33,840
Categories would be so fun.

5412
04:29:33,840 --> 04:29:33,940
Run.

5413
04:29:37,600 --> 04:29:39,640
Do you also get health from that?

5414
04:29:40,180 --> 04:29:40,420
Run.

5415
04:29:48,940 --> 04:29:51,120
There's a hill behind the other door in the elevator room.

5416
04:29:51,980 --> 04:29:52,520
Wait, where is it?

5417
04:29:52,680 --> 04:29:53,700
Oh, that's right!

5418
04:29:54,160 --> 04:29:55,980
There was that other battle we totally...

5419
04:29:56,900 --> 04:29:59,000
We totally forgot about.

5420
04:29:59,700 --> 04:30:00,640
Well, I forgot about it.

5421
04:30:06,120 --> 04:30:07,360
I'll give it a try.

5422
04:30:08,420 --> 04:30:08,980
I didn't say.

5423
04:30:09,820 --> 04:30:10,640
Try the right one.

5424
04:30:11,460 --> 04:30:12,100
It didn't work.

5425
04:30:12,460 --> 04:30:13,140
Stupid Rio.

5426
04:30:13,840 --> 04:30:14,240
No.

5427
04:30:23,920 --> 04:30:24,940
Stupid Rio.

5428
04:30:26,240 --> 04:30:26,920
It won't work.

5429
04:30:28,220 --> 04:30:29,400
She gives up so easily.

5430
04:30:30,580 --> 04:30:31,180
You okay Rio?

5431
04:30:34,060 --> 04:30:36,940
Is it worth having to do another annoying battle though?

5432
04:30:37,200 --> 04:30:38,100
To get a health kit.

5433
04:30:38,740 --> 04:30:39,620
Probably not.

5434
04:30:42,120 --> 04:30:42,260
Yeah.

5435
04:30:44,400 --> 04:30:45,040
Okay.

5436
04:30:49,120 --> 04:30:49,460
Okay.

5437
04:30:53,060 --> 04:30:53,420
Okay.

5438
04:30:57,220 --> 04:30:57,860
Okay.

5439
04:31:04,180 --> 04:31:05,100
Okay.

5440
04:31:06,280 --> 04:31:06,680
Okay.

5441
04:31:11,500 --> 04:31:13,080
Get ready, set.

5442
04:31:16,440 --> 04:31:18,020
Did it work?

5443
04:31:19,740 --> 04:31:21,420
We did it at the same time.

5444
04:31:21,960 --> 04:31:23,220
Get ready, set.

5445
04:31:25,580 --> 04:31:25,880
Girl!

5446
04:31:27,360 --> 04:31:29,360
Get ready, set.

5447
04:31:32,640 --> 04:31:34,420
I did it when she said now!

5448
04:31:35,440 --> 04:31:36,180
Mito very cute.

5449
04:31:36,280 --> 04:31:37,120
Thanks Jane!

5450
04:31:37,240 --> 04:31:38,580
Thanks for 9 months!

5451
04:31:40,720 --> 04:31:41,000
Oh whoops.

5452
04:31:41,820 --> 04:31:42,760
I pressed the wrong thing.

5453
04:31:44,520 --> 04:31:45,860
Get ready, set.

5454
04:31:50,340 --> 04:31:51,640
We did it!

5455
04:31:51,860 --> 04:31:52,100
Rio.

5456
04:31:53,500 --> 04:31:54,020
We.

5457
04:31:54,400 --> 04:31:54,680
Rio.

5458
04:31:55,200 --> 04:31:57,160
Rio, you can't take all the credit for this.

5459
04:31:58,580 --> 04:31:59,760
She's so rude.

5460
04:32:02,960 --> 04:32:03,560
lol

5461
04:32:07,880 --> 04:32:08,480
Wow!

5462
04:32:10,080 --> 04:32:11,740
Okay, save point.

5463
04:32:16,400 --> 04:32:17,980
I'm not going through all of this.

5464
04:32:18,080 --> 04:32:19,280
We are looking for a green stone.

5465
04:32:20,140 --> 04:32:21,320
Rio is so selfish.

5466
04:32:21,680 --> 04:32:23,400
You egotistical woman!

5467
04:32:23,640 --> 04:32:25,500
I thought we was your favorite word!

5468
04:32:25,800 --> 04:32:28,100
I thought we was your favorite word!

5469
04:32:30,320 --> 04:32:31,640
Oh wait, no?

5470
04:32:32,580 --> 04:32:33,640
Let's do this one.

5471
04:32:34,700 --> 04:32:34,820
Yeah.

5472
04:32:43,490 --> 04:32:44,070
Good!

5473
04:32:44,990 --> 04:32:49,030
It's always you failed or you messed up.

5474
04:32:49,150 --> 04:32:51,490
Yeah, or I did it but never we did it.

5475
04:32:51,970 --> 04:32:53,150
Okay, walk.

5476
04:32:54,310 --> 04:32:55,390
Alright, walk around.

5477
04:32:56,090 --> 04:32:57,290
Let's look around.

5478
04:32:57,490 --> 04:32:58,140
We are looking for...

5479
04:32:58,670 --> 04:33:00,750
Alright, we are in front of case 9.

5480
04:33:02,490 --> 04:33:03,170
8.

5481
04:33:03,490 --> 04:33:05,610
What is that big one right there?

5482
04:33:07,490 --> 04:33:09,510
Am I getting ambushed?

5483
04:33:09,670 --> 04:33:11,130
Yes I am.

5484
04:33:13,670 --> 04:33:14,350
Mouth!

5485
04:33:15,670 --> 04:33:16,350
Mouth!

5486
04:33:17,470 --> 04:33:17,930
Shoot!

5487
04:33:18,990 --> 04:33:19,690
Shoot!

5488
04:33:21,230 --> 04:33:21,670
Shoot!

5489
04:33:22,670 --> 04:33:23,630
Stomach!

5490
04:33:24,650 --> 04:33:25,250
Head!

5491
04:33:26,770 --> 04:33:27,550
Stomach!

5492
04:33:28,490 --> 04:33:29,750
Shoot!

5493
04:33:31,330 --> 04:33:32,150
Flee!

5494
04:33:34,970 --> 04:33:35,610
Shoot!

5495
04:33:36,890 --> 04:33:37,710
Shoot!

5496
04:33:38,210 --> 04:33:39,350
What else is in here?

5497
04:33:39,570 --> 04:33:39,910
Shoot!

5498
04:33:41,230 --> 04:33:42,050
Stomach!

5499
04:33:43,130 --> 04:33:43,770
Oh my god.

5500
04:33:44,090 --> 04:33:44,570
Stomach!

5501
04:33:45,570 --> 04:33:45,930
Shoot!

5502
04:33:47,030 --> 04:33:47,450
Shoot!

5503
04:33:49,850 --> 04:33:50,890
What the hell is that?

5504
04:33:55,940 --> 04:33:56,760
Enemy...

5505
04:33:57,470 --> 04:33:58,780
No, enemy 3.

5506
04:34:04,710 --> 04:34:05,310
Shoot!

5507
04:34:05,310 --> 04:34:06,790
Auto fire!

5508
04:34:09,270 --> 04:34:10,030
Nevermind.

5509
04:34:10,730 --> 04:34:11,110
Stomach!

5510
04:34:12,090 --> 04:34:12,730
Auto fire!

5511
04:34:13,790 --> 04:34:14,870
Oh, that worked actually.

5512
04:34:15,070 --> 04:34:15,670
Okay, nice.

5513
04:34:17,390 --> 04:34:18,490
Right eye!

5514
04:34:19,610 --> 04:34:20,250
Right eye!

5515
04:34:21,190 --> 04:34:21,450
Shoot!

5516
04:34:23,130 --> 04:34:24,150
Middle eye!

5517
04:34:24,450 --> 04:34:25,770
Actually no, vines!

5518
04:34:27,110 --> 04:34:28,170
Auto fire!

5519
04:34:30,290 --> 04:34:31,050

5520
04:34:35,310 --> 04:34:36,110

5522
04:34:39,210 --> 04:34:40,550

5525
04:34:46,790 --> 04:34:47,490
Vines!

5526
04:34:47,790 --> 04:34:50,250
Move right!

5527
04:34:51,670 --> 04:34:52,650
Move right!

5528
04:34:53,530 --> 04:34:55,110
I can't see anything.

5529
04:34:55,870 --> 04:34:56,530
Move right!

5530
04:34:58,070 --> 04:34:59,550
Maybe we are okay here.

5531
04:35:00,370 --> 04:35:00,910
Auto fire!

5532
04:35:02,150 --> 04:35:02,870
Nope, okay.

5533
04:35:05,310 --> 04:35:05,750
Move right!

5534
04:35:08,230 --> 04:35:09,130
Move right!

5535
04:35:09,590 --> 04:35:10,890
I wish I could see anything.

5536
04:35:13,590 --> 04:35:14,170
Vines!

5537
04:35:15,790 --> 04:35:16,490

Auto fire!

5541
04:35:27,230 --> 04:35:28,530
Am I shooting anything?

5542
04:35:30,290 --> 04:35:32,510
It looks like it's got it's hand on it's hips.

5543
04:35:32,690 --> 04:35:33,650
Like it's annoyed at me.

5544
04:35:34,630 --> 04:35:35,770
Auto fire!

5545
04:35:37,450 --> 04:35:39,390
I don't know what I'm supposed to be shooting.

5546
04:35:42,430 --> 04:35:43,190

5547
04:35:46,950 --> 04:35:47,710
Branches!

5548
04:35:48,710 --> 04:35:49,850
What did you do?

5549
04:35:52,470 --> 04:35:53,230
Branches!

5550
04:35:55,610 --> 04:35:56,850

5551
04:35:57,010 --> 04:35:57,550

5552
04:35:58,410 --> 04:35:59,290
Move left!

5553
04:36:01,730 --> 04:36:02,490

5556
04:36:11,290 --> 04:36:12,590
Am I hitting anything?

5557
04:36:12,930 --> 04:36:13,750
Oh my god.

5558
04:36:14,310 --> 04:36:15,190

Auto fire!

5563
04:36:29,530 --> 04:36:31,450
I think like tiniest bit ever.

5564
04:36:32,210 --> 04:36:33,430
What should I do?

5565
04:36:33,670 --> 04:36:34,070

5577
04:36:50,290 --> 04:36:50,890
It's working a little.

5578
04:36:51,070 --> 04:36:52,290
Slowly but surely we are getting there.

5579
04:36:52,390 --> 04:36:53,030
What should I do?

5580
04:36:53,550 --> 04:36:55,710
And it doesn't hurt us from back here so that's kinda nice.

5581

Nice.

5607
04:37:32,690 --> 04:37:33,750
It's posing.

5608
04:37:34,550 --> 04:37:36,030
The sassiest alien.

5609
04:37:37,310 --> 04:37:40,370
The sassiest alien of all.

5610
04:37:42,090 --> 04:37:44,950
Is that case...

5611
04:37:44,950 --> 04:37:45,250
Wait.

5612
04:37:48,410 --> 04:37:50,670
We are in front of case 8?

5613
04:37:51,630 --> 04:37:53,210
Check case 7.

5614
04:37:54,030 --> 04:37:55,290
It looks kinda green.

5615
04:37:55,790 --> 04:37:57,650
Maybe it's the philosopher's stone.

5616
04:37:59,290 --> 04:38:00,210
Nope.

5617
04:38:02,150 --> 04:38:02,510

04:38:07,830 --> 04:38:08,230
Okay.

5621
04:38:13,890 --> 04:38:15,330
Strafe attacks...

5622
04:38:15,330 --> 04:38:18,790
Yeah, strafe attacks like kind of hit every point.

5623
04:38:18,890 --> 04:38:21,190
They like kind of like go through a bunch of different points.

5624
04:38:21,490 --> 04:38:23,030
So it's kinda... it's not so bad actually.

5625
04:38:25,430 --> 04:38:26,150

5635
04:38:52,610 --> 04:38:53,410
Just gonna stand here.

5636
04:38:55,590 --> 04:38:56,190
I don't know.

5637
04:38:56,510 --> 04:38:56,770
Ai!

5638
04:39:10,470 --> 04:39:10,910

Ai!

5640
04:39:23,250 --> 04:39:24,710
She doesn't know where to look.

04:39:25,170 --> 04:39:25,550
Run!

5642
04:39:29,720 --> 04:39:30,560
Jump!

5643
04:39:31,760 --> 04:39:32,380

Nice.

5648
04:39:37,400 --> 04:39:38,500
I don't know if that did anything.

5649
04:39:38,600 --> 04:39:38,880
Ai!

5650
04:39:40,420 --> 04:39:41,040

Flee!

5656
04:39:53,580 --> 04:39:55,640
Oh it's gonna disappear in a second anyway.

5657
04:39:55,860 --> 04:39:56,260
Nevermind.

5658
04:39:58,280 --> 04:39:58,900
Jump!

5659
04:40:00,560 --> 04:40:00,920

Flee!

5661
04:40:04,500 --> 04:40:05,460
Mouth!

5662
04:40:07,680 --> 04:40:08,900
Actually yeah you should do that.

5663
04:40:09,060 --> 04:40:09,320
Ai!

5664
04:40:10,700 --> 04:40:11,240
Shoot!

5665
04:40:14,100 --> 04:40:15,360
Turn around!

5666
04:40:18,530 --> 04:40:19,130
Shoot!

5667
04:40:23,900 --> 04:40:24,660
Jump!

5668
04:40:26,980 --> 04:40:27,940
Flee!

5669
04:40:31,910 --> 04:40:34,410
This monster is so difficult.

5670
04:40:39,300 --> 04:40:40,040
Ai!

5671
04:40:41,420 --> 04:40:42,160
Flee.

5672
04:40:42,700 --> 04:40:44,220
I might die here actually.

5673
04:40:45,320 --> 04:40:45,980
I might die.

5674
04:40:46,420 --> 04:40:47,440
This thing is so annoying.

5675
04:40:47,580 --> 04:40:47,760
Flee!

5676
04:40:49,940 --> 04:40:51,160
I might die.

5677
04:40:52,220 --> 04:40:52,620
Ai!

5678
04:40:52,960 --> 04:40:53,800
Turn around!

5679
04:40:54,700 --> 04:40:57,500
As soon as I turn around it disappears!

5680
04:40:59,920 --> 04:41:00,660
Ai!

5681
04:41:01,460 --> 04:41:01,940
Shoot!

5682
04:41:03,880 --> 04:41:04,620
Jump!

5683
04:41:22,970 --> 04:41:24,850
We'll have to do the first battle again.

5684
04:41:28,550 --> 04:41:30,350
We'll have to do the first battle again.

5685
04:41:37,040 --> 04:41:37,700
That's okay.

5686
04:41:37,760 --> 04:41:39,260
That one wasn't as bad I suppose.

5687
04:41:42,540 --> 04:41:44,740
Also I was like walking over here.

5688
04:41:45,380 --> 04:41:47,260
I guess I could've maybe gone to the save point.

5689
04:41:47,940 --> 04:41:48,360
I don't know.

5690
04:41:49,040 --> 04:41:49,520
Okay.

5691
04:41:50,300 --> 04:41:50,780
Walk.

5692
04:41:51,600 --> 04:41:52,080
Yes.

5693
04:41:53,500 --> 04:41:53,980
Yes.

5694
04:41:56,480 --> 04:41:58,180
Maybe go the other way.

5695
04:41:59,100 --> 04:41:59,900
I don't know.

5696
04:42:04,470 --> 04:42:06,450
Can't stop her from walking that direction.

5697
04:42:07,530 --> 04:42:08,930
You trying to finish today?

5698
04:42:09,050 --> 04:42:10,050
Oh yeah we'll finish today.

5699
04:42:11,690 --> 04:42:12,130
Mouth!

5700
04:42:13,350 --> 04:42:13,990
Mouth!

5701
04:42:14,990 --> 04:42:15,310
Shoot!

5702
04:42:16,450 --> 04:42:17,050
Auto fire!

5703
04:42:19,050 --> 04:42:20,090
Auto fire!

5704
04:42:21,170 --> 04:42:21,810
Auto fire!

5705
04:42:25,910 --> 04:42:26,550
Flee!

5706
04:42:29,330 --> 04:42:30,090
Auto fire!

5707
04:42:32,130 --> 04:42:33,050
Mouth!

5708
04:42:34,310 --> 04:42:34,770
Mouth!

5709
04:42:35,230 --> 04:42:36,070
Shoot!

5710
04:42:37,690 --> 04:42:38,270
Jump back!

5711
04:42:39,490 --> 04:42:40,310
Jump back!

5712
04:42:42,470 --> 04:42:43,390
Mouth!

5713
04:42:44,610 --> 04:42:45,370
Auto fire!

5714
04:42:47,330 --> 04:42:49,450
Her aim is so bad.

5715
04:42:49,830 --> 04:42:50,470
Auto fire!

5716
04:42:51,350 --> 04:42:52,270
Stomach!

5717
04:42:54,510 --> 04:42:55,710
Auto fire!

5718
04:42:56,550 --> 04:42:57,490
Auto fire!

5719
04:43:02,050 --> 04:43:02,950
Auto fire!

5720
04:43:05,650 --> 04:43:06,650
Auto fire!

5721
04:43:09,490 --> 04:43:10,090
Reload!

5722
04:43:11,310 --> 04:43:11,810
Reload!

5723
04:43:19,270 --> 04:43:19,870
Stomach!

5724
04:43:24,130 --> 04:43:24,730
Shoot!

5725
04:43:27,330 --> 04:43:27,750
Mouth!

5726
04:43:28,750 --> 04:43:29,710
Oh my god!

5727
04:43:29,770 --> 04:43:30,090
Oh my god!

5728
04:43:30,830 --> 04:43:31,430
Flee!

5729
04:43:32,270 --> 04:43:32,530
No!

5730
04:43:32,550 --> 04:43:32,650
No!

5731
04:43:32,750 --> 04:43:32,850
No!

5732
04:43:32,870 --> 04:43:32,990
No!

5733
04:43:32,990 --> 04:43:33,530
That way!

5734
04:43:33,570 --> 04:43:34,010
Not that way!

5735
04:43:34,050 --> 04:43:34,390
Oh my gosh!

5736
04:43:34,390 --> 04:43:34,990
Enemy 1!

5737
04:43:35,550 --> 04:43:36,330
Enemy 2!

5738
04:43:36,830 --> 04:43:37,770
Enemy 2!

5739
04:43:38,470 --> 04:43:39,030
Flee!

5740
04:43:40,010 --> 04:43:40,350
Oh my god!

5741
04:43:40,430 --> 04:43:40,630
Please!

5742
04:43:40,850 --> 04:43:41,670
I need you to run girl!

5743
04:43:42,050 --> 04:43:42,650
Enemy 2!

5744
04:43:43,770 --> 04:43:44,010
Flee!

5745
04:43:45,950 --> 04:43:47,430
I need you to get out of there!

5746
04:43:49,410 --> 04:43:49,930
Flee!

5747
04:43:51,010 --> 04:43:52,150
There you go!

5748
04:43:52,330 --> 04:43:52,970
There you go!

5749
04:43:53,150 --> 04:43:54,130
That's a good girl!

5750
04:43:54,310 --> 04:43:55,050
Enemy 3!

5751
04:43:56,250 --> 04:43:56,830
Jump back!

5752
04:43:56,830 --> 04:43:57,330
Jump!

5753
04:43:57,930 --> 04:43:58,450
Mouth!

5754
04:43:58,710 --> 04:44:00,350
I got that command!

5755
04:44:00,590 --> 04:44:02,130
I got the command jump back!

5756
04:44:02,270 --> 04:44:03,390
And she does not do it!

5757
04:44:03,490 --> 04:44:05,550
She goes jump and then she steps back!

5758
04:44:05,830 --> 04:44:08,810
I can't with her and her silly antics.

5759
04:44:09,050 --> 04:44:09,650
Anyway, sorry.

5760
04:44:09,950 --> 04:44:11,410
My eyes are bleeding.

5761
04:44:11,710 --> 04:44:12,410
I know, me too.

5762
04:44:12,690 --> 04:44:13,930
Thank you for the super chat though.

5763
04:44:17,230 --> 04:44:17,910
Jump back!

5764
04:44:18,390 --> 04:44:18,910
Jump back!

5765
04:44:21,050 --> 04:44:21,570
Mouth!

5766
04:44:23,690 --> 04:44:24,570
Jump back!

5767
04:44:24,810 --> 04:44:25,950
Jump back!

5768
04:44:27,990 --> 04:44:28,670
Back!

5769
04:44:28,990 --> 04:44:29,290
Mouth!

5770
04:44:29,510 --> 04:44:30,050
Back!

5771
04:44:30,310 --> 04:44:30,690
Back!

5772
04:44:32,310 --> 04:44:33,190
Auto-fire!

5773
04:44:33,450 --> 04:44:33,690
Mouth!

5774
04:44:34,190 --> 04:44:35,050
Auto-fire!

5775
04:44:35,330 --> 04:44:35,850
Auto-fire!

5776
04:44:37,210 --> 04:44:37,890
Head!

5777
04:44:42,540 --> 04:44:43,220
Stomach!

5778
04:44:43,540 --> 04:44:44,060
Stomach!

5779
04:44:44,800 --> 04:44:45,400
Auto-fire!

5780
04:44:45,740 --> 04:44:45,900
Mouth!

5781
04:44:46,360 --> 04:44:47,040
Stomach!

5782
04:44:47,380 --> 04:44:47,820
Stomach!

5783
04:44:48,140 --> 04:44:48,700
Auto-fire!

5784
04:44:49,060 --> 04:44:49,600
Auto-fire!

5785
04:44:50,500 --> 04:44:51,180
Reload!

5786
04:44:51,180 --> 04:44:51,180
No!

5787
04:44:51,200 --> 04:44:51,840
You're good!

5788
04:44:52,180 --> 04:44:53,040
Watch closely and don't reload!

5789
04:44:53,040 --> 04:44:53,520
Reload!

5790
04:44:55,520 --> 04:44:56,200
Back!

5791
04:44:56,660 --> 04:44:57,000
Back!

5792
04:44:58,200 --> 04:44:58,880
Stomach!

5793
04:44:58,880 --> 04:44:59,760
Stomach!

5794
04:45:00,180 --> 04:45:00,560
Stomach!

5795
04:45:00,920 --> 04:45:02,100
There we go.

5796
04:45:02,220 --> 04:45:02,920
Ok, ok, ok.

5797
04:45:03,580 --> 04:45:04,260
Turn around!

5798
04:45:06,380 --> 04:45:07,580
Ok.

5799
04:45:08,420 --> 04:45:10,920
Move right!

5800
04:45:13,160 --> 04:45:13,980
Strafe!

5801
04:45:16,880 --> 04:45:17,600
Strafe!

5802
04:45:19,520 --> 04:45:20,220
Reload!

5803
04:45:21,420 --> 04:45:22,120
Strafe!

5804
04:45:23,960 --> 04:45:25,360
Strafe!

5805
04:45:26,800 --> 04:45:28,200
Strafe!

5806
04:45:29,710 --> 04:45:30,500
Yeah, reload.

5807
04:45:34,040 --> 04:45:35,060
Move right!

5808
04:45:36,140 --> 04:45:37,400
Move right a little bit more.

5809
04:45:38,460 --> 04:45:38,620
Ok.

5810
04:45:38,980 --> 04:45:39,360
Strafe!

5811
04:45:40,540 --> 04:45:41,280
Strafe!

5812
04:45:43,460 --> 04:45:44,200
Strafe!

5813
04:45:45,660 --> 04:45:50,940
I wonder if that's the one that's hidden by the barrels.

5814
04:45:53,300 --> 04:45:54,040
Strafe!

5815
04:45:54,440 --> 04:45:56,260
But also reload.

5816
04:45:57,760 --> 04:45:58,860
And strafe.

5817
04:45:59,300 --> 04:46:00,640
Nope, strafe.

5818
04:46:04,100 --> 04:46:05,080
Uh, strafe?

5819
04:46:07,560 --> 04:46:08,240
Reload!

5820
04:46:09,680 --> 04:46:10,360
Reload!

5821
04:46:12,900 --> 04:46:13,920
Spin gun!

5822
04:46:15,280 --> 04:46:17,200
Oh, I can't see anything now.

5823
04:46:17,420 --> 04:46:17,860
Where am I?

5824
04:46:18,200 --> 04:46:18,680
Move right!

5825
04:46:20,980 --> 04:46:21,920
Move right!

5826
04:46:23,140 --> 04:46:23,960
No, no!

5827
04:46:24,040 --> 04:46:24,520
Turn around!

5828
04:46:25,470 --> 04:46:25,980
No!

5829
04:46:26,380 --> 04:46:27,120
Turn right!

5830
04:46:31,150 --> 04:46:32,080
Turn right!

5831
04:46:36,080 --> 04:46:37,100
Strafe!

5832
04:46:38,920 --> 04:46:41,040
Uh, move right!

5833
04:46:43,100 --> 04:46:44,120
Strafe!

5834
04:46:46,580 --> 04:46:48,180
We're getting it slowly but surely.

5835
04:46:48,880 --> 04:46:49,360
Reload!

5836
04:46:53,020 --> 04:46:54,040
Strafe!

5837
04:46:56,360 --> 04:46:57,900
Uh, move right!

5838
04:47:00,360 --> 04:47:00,920
Strafe!

5839
04:47:02,740 --> 04:47:03,920
Got her aim.

5840
04:47:04,640 --> 04:47:05,200
Reload!

5841
04:47:06,900 --> 04:47:07,460
Reload!

5842
04:47:10,120 --> 04:47:10,680
Strafe!

5843
04:47:12,240 --> 04:47:16,300
Yeah, I feel like this way takes longer but at least I'm not getting hit.

5844
04:47:17,240 --> 04:47:17,800
Strafe!

5845
04:47:18,880 --> 04:47:20,100
What did you do that for?

5846
04:47:20,240 --> 04:47:20,840
Where are you going?

5847
04:47:24,540 --> 04:47:25,840
That was my fault.

5848
04:47:25,940 --> 04:47:26,480
Move left!

5849
04:47:28,320 --> 04:47:29,320
Move left!

5850
04:47:30,720 --> 04:47:32,120
No, there we go.

5851
04:47:33,560 --> 04:47:34,180
Move left!

5852
04:47:36,960 --> 04:47:37,640
Strafe!

5853
04:47:38,120 --> 04:47:39,060
Oh, my bad.

5854
04:47:39,420 --> 04:47:40,640
I didn't realize she wasn't loaded.

5855
04:47:42,100 --> 04:47:42,780
Strafe!

5856
04:47:45,420 --> 04:47:46,100
Strafe!

5857
04:47:49,080 --> 04:47:49,760
Reload!

5858
04:47:51,760 --> 04:47:52,240
Reload!

5859
04:47:54,020 --> 04:47:54,280
Strafe!

5860
04:47:56,520 --> 04:47:57,000
Strafe!

5861
04:47:59,180 --> 04:48:03,560
I think it's the eyes that are the weak point, but...

5862
04:48:03,560 --> 04:48:08,600
Like, if I do the leaves, I think it shows the eyes and then those are the weak points.

5863
04:48:08,740 --> 04:48:09,220
Strafe!

5864
04:48:11,860 --> 04:48:12,340
Strafe!

5865
04:48:12,980 --> 04:48:14,080
It's almost dead though.

5866
04:48:14,260 --> 04:48:14,620
That's okay.

5867
04:48:15,880 --> 04:48:16,360
Strafe!

5868
04:48:17,980 --> 04:48:20,240
Well, she didn't do that, you know?

5869
04:48:21,840 --> 04:48:22,520
Strafe!

5870
04:48:27,180 --> 04:48:29,900
If she didn't do that, it would be okay, you know?

5871
04:48:32,380 --> 04:48:33,420
Save point.

5872
04:48:34,640 --> 04:48:35,560
No, save point.

5873
04:48:37,360 --> 04:48:38,160
Save point.

5874
04:48:39,800 --> 04:48:43,200
Alright, we'll save.

5875
04:48:48,840 --> 04:48:49,860
We're saving.

5876
04:48:59,400 --> 04:49:01,140
Goodbye Observatory Restaurant.

5877
04:49:03,380 --> 04:49:11,380
Actually, well, that last fight was not ideal because I did get attacked by the stinking slimes.

5878
04:49:11,500 --> 04:49:13,620
The stinking slugs a couple of times, but that's okay.

5879
04:49:14,860 --> 04:49:17,060
The way we have to save after every battle.

5880
04:49:17,220 --> 04:49:20,240
The way we have to save after everything that we do.

5881
04:49:21,440 --> 04:49:26,740
You can't skip the cutscenes, so if there's a cutscene you want to save after that, you can't.

5882
04:49:27,160 --> 04:49:29,020
It's just insanity.

5883
04:49:29,680 --> 04:49:30,860
Alright, get up.

5884
04:49:35,320 --> 04:49:36,440
Let's check...

5885
04:49:37,200 --> 04:49:38,240
Case 9.

5886
04:49:40,520 --> 04:49:43,220
Oh, she's going all the way around.

5887
04:49:43,440 --> 04:49:45,640
Around town.

5888
04:49:46,760 --> 04:49:48,340
Oh, just kidding.

5889
04:49:48,580 --> 04:49:49,660
I was at the wrong spot.

5890
04:49:55,280 --> 04:49:56,960
That's confusing!

5891
04:49:59,680 --> 04:50:01,360
Case 2.

5892
04:50:02,220 --> 04:50:04,620
I thought she was going...

5893
04:50:05,240 --> 04:50:06,600
Hyper protein.

5894
04:50:07,600 --> 04:50:10,080
Wow, get those for working out.

5895
04:50:10,540 --> 04:50:11,760
Hyper protein.

5896
04:50:16,140 --> 04:50:18,380
Oh, wait, what?

5897
04:50:20,500 --> 04:50:21,020
Mouth.

5898
04:50:23,160 --> 04:50:23,920
Flea.

5899
04:50:25,480 --> 04:50:25,700
Flea.

5900
04:50:30,310 --> 04:50:31,790
Oh, this is not so bad.

5901
04:50:32,690 --> 04:50:33,390
Head.

5902
04:50:34,990 --> 04:50:35,950
Stomach.

5903
04:50:37,310 --> 04:50:37,670
Shoot.

5904
04:50:37,670 --> 04:50:37,770
Shoot.

5905
04:50:38,110 --> 04:50:39,410
Shoot.

5906
04:50:39,930 --> 04:50:41,330
Shoot.

5907
04:50:42,430 --> 04:50:43,830
Shoot.

5908
04:50:45,930 --> 04:50:47,330
Sure.

5909
04:50:51,170 --> 04:50:53,270
Oh, there's another one over there.

5910
04:50:54,010 --> 04:50:55,410
Strafe.

5911
04:50:59,670 --> 04:51:00,390
Leaf.

5912
04:51:01,810 --> 04:51:02,870
Leaf.

5913
04:51:03,470 --> 04:51:07,110
See, I think if I go for the leaves...

5914
04:51:07,110 --> 04:51:09,030
And then I uncover the eyes...

5915
04:51:09,030 --> 04:51:10,590
If she doesn't hit the leaf, it sucks.

5916
04:51:10,830 --> 04:51:14,730
So, just strafing ends up being the better option, I think.

5917
04:51:15,170 --> 04:51:15,430
Anyway.

5918
04:51:17,490 --> 04:51:18,050

No, no, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.

5934
04:51:53,190 --> 04:51:53,930
Wrong way, wrong way.

5935
04:51:54,030 --> 04:51:54,310

5936
04:51:56,670 --> 04:51:57,690
Flea.

5937
04:51:58,450 --> 04:51:58,990
Flea.

5938
04:51:59,790 --> 04:52:00,810
Enemy 1.

5939
04:52:01,510 --> 04:52:02,130
Enemy 2.

5940
04:52:02,490 --> 04:52:03,430
Enemy 2.

5941
04:52:03,710 --> 04:52:04,770

04:52:05,650 --> 04:52:07,310
Turn around.

5944
04:52:10,310 --> 04:52:11,650

5948
04:52:21,450 --> 04:52:23,130
Holy cow.

5949
04:52:23,130 --> 04:52:24,750
Move left.

5950
04:52:25,930 --> 04:52:27,330

5951
04:52:31,130 --> 04:52:31,870

Flea.

5962
04:52:56,430 --> 04:52:58,350
Good, good, good, good.

5963
04:52:59,050 --> 04:52:59,450
Good, good.

5964
04:53:00,610 --> 04:53:01,190

04:53:16,830 --> 04:53:18,130
Oh my gosh.

5972
04:53:18,130 --> 04:53:19,490
Auto-fire.

5973
04:53:20,170 --> 04:53:21,770

Move right.

5975
04:53:26,290 --> 04:53:27,250
Move right.

5976
04:53:27,670 --> 04:53:28,710
Oh my gosh, it's almost dead.

5977
04:53:29,990 --> 04:53:30,850
Move right.

5978
04:53:33,090 --> 04:53:33,730
Strafe.

5979
04:53:39,580 --> 04:53:42,880
Wait, does that mean I don't have to fight the...

5980
04:53:42,880 --> 04:53:44,000
the...

5981
04:53:44,000 --> 04:53:44,760
other thing?

5982
04:53:46,080 --> 04:53:47,700
That's huge, if so.

5983
04:53:47,700 --> 04:53:49,160
Save point.

5984
04:53:51,440 --> 04:53:52,060
Run.

5985
04:53:55,680 --> 04:53:56,300
Nevermind.

5986
04:53:57,100 --> 04:53:58,480
We just got ambushed.

5987
04:53:59,680 --> 04:54:01,180
Right eye.

5988
04:54:02,460 --> 04:54:03,480
Right eye.

5989
04:54:04,680 --> 04:54:05,480
Right eye.

5990
04:54:06,700 --> 04:54:07,460
Left eye.

5991
04:54:08,580 --> 04:54:09,300
Left eye.

5992
04:54:10,460 --> 04:54:11,160
Left eye.

5993
04:54:12,220 --> 04:54:13,100
Middle eye.

5994
04:54:14,200 --> 04:54:14,680
Shoot.

5995
04:54:14,680 --> 04:54:16,420
Auto-fire.

5996
04:54:20,300 --> 04:54:21,680
Auto-fire.

5997
04:54:23,180 --> 04:54:24,580
Red eye.

5998
04:54:26,300 --> 04:54:27,340
Body.

5999
04:54:28,240 --> 04:54:28,900
Wait.

6000
04:54:29,440 --> 04:54:29,960

6001
04:54:30,860 --> 04:54:31,180
Flea.

6002
04:54:35,120 --> 04:54:36,580
What the hell?

6003
04:54:36,620 --> 04:54:37,260
It chased...

6004
04:54:37,260 --> 04:54:37,660
Tail.

6005
04:54:38,940 --> 04:54:41,020
Auto-fire.

6006
04:54:42,080 --> 04:54:42,320

04:54:42,700 --> 04:54:42,980
Tail.

6008
04:54:44,600 --> 04:54:45,640
Tail.

6009
04:54:47,200 --> 04:54:48,200

6010
04:54:48,460 --> 04:54:49,140
Oh my gosh.

6011
04:54:50,000 --> 04:54:51,240
Mouth.

6012
04:54:51,800 --> 04:54:53,320
Auto-fire.

6013
04:54:55,400 --> 04:54:56,740
That was good.

6014
04:54:58,400 --> 04:54:59,320
Flea.

6015
04:55:05,320 --> 04:55:06,900
It doesn't... Tail.

6016
04:55:07,980 --> 04:55:08,400
Tail.

6017
04:55:09,300 --> 04:55:09,680
Tail.

6018
04:55:12,500 --> 04:55:13,120
Shoot.

6019
04:55:13,120 --> 04:55:13,440
Shoot.

6020
04:55:14,340 --> 04:55:18,420
Another one?

6021
04:55:19,140 --> 04:55:20,000
What is it?

6022
04:55:20,020 --> 04:55:20,740
I don't even know what it is.

6023
04:55:20,800 --> 04:55:22,080
Oh my gosh, it's the same fucking thing.

6024
04:55:23,840 --> 04:55:25,120
Right eye.

6025
04:55:26,060 --> 04:55:26,960
Left eye.

6026
04:55:27,740 --> 04:55:28,700

04:55:33,060 --> 04:55:33,620
Left eye.

6029
04:55:34,920 --> 04:55:35,740
Middle eye.

6030
04:55:37,080 --> 04:55:38,080
Red eye.

6031
04:55:40,360 --> 04:55:41,000
Mouth.

6032
04:55:42,120 --> 04:55:42,680
Body.

6033
04:55:43,680 --> 04:55:44,240
Wait.

6034
04:55:46,460 --> 04:55:47,020
Flea.

6035
04:55:51,050 --> 04:55:52,650
No, I can't avoid that.

6036
04:55:52,730 --> 04:55:53,470
It's so annoying.

6037
04:55:53,750 --> 04:55:54,010
Tail.

6038
04:55:56,950 --> 04:55:58,130
Please let that be it.

6039
04:56:00,150 --> 04:56:02,230
You guys, I can't heal.

6040
04:56:02,430 --> 04:56:03,810
This is so upsetting.

6041
04:56:04,230 --> 04:56:05,410
This is so upsetting.

6042
04:56:06,750 --> 04:56:11,810
Oh my gosh, there is no way to interrupt it because...

6043
04:56:12,610 --> 04:56:15,330
It's moving and you can't shoot it's body because it's hard.

6044
04:56:15,490 --> 04:56:18,150
And if you shoot it's tail, it's behind it.

6045
04:56:18,250 --> 04:56:20,150
So there is no way to do that.

6046
04:56:21,370 --> 04:56:22,670
There is no way to do that.

6047
04:56:24,450 --> 04:56:25,050
The tail.

6048
04:56:25,170 --> 04:56:26,150
She will miss the tail.

6049
04:56:26,910 --> 04:56:27,310
100%.

6050
04:56:27,830 --> 04:56:28,230
100%.

6051
04:56:28,230 --> 04:56:29,170
She will miss the tail.

6052
04:56:31,290 --> 04:56:32,090
Oh gosh.

6053
04:56:33,930 --> 04:56:34,530
Oh man.

6054
04:56:35,690 --> 04:56:36,130
Move right.

6055
04:56:39,630 --> 04:56:40,250
I'll save.

6056
04:56:40,890 --> 04:56:41,410
Dodge left.

6057
04:56:44,070 --> 04:56:45,290
He doesn't stop.

6058
04:56:45,470 --> 04:56:45,830
Tail.

6059
04:56:46,650 --> 04:56:47,310
Turn around.

6060
04:56:49,230 --> 04:56:49,910
Right eye.

6061
04:56:51,450 --> 04:56:52,830
We are about to die you guys.

6062
04:56:52,990 --> 04:56:55,250
We are about to die and we are going to have to do this all over again.

6063
04:56:57,130 --> 04:57:00,810
Hold on, I want to see what this room is like because why am I getting different things?

6064
04:57:12,730 --> 04:57:14,170
Oh my god.

6065
04:57:14,830 --> 04:57:16,230
Oh my god.

6066
04:57:18,490 --> 04:57:19,250
Okay.

6067
04:57:20,510 --> 04:57:21,530
Oh shit.

6068
04:57:21,770 --> 04:57:23,350
Okay, there is a lot of stuff here.

6069
04:57:24,250 --> 04:57:24,930
Run!

6070
04:57:45,480 --> 04:57:46,540
Which one was it?

6071
04:57:47,340 --> 04:57:48,160
This one.

6072
04:57:50,660 --> 04:57:53,100
I don't know how we are going to get through this room with no health.

6073
04:57:54,960 --> 04:57:57,480
I don't know how we are going to get through this room with no health.

6074
04:57:58,480 --> 04:57:59,800
Oh shit.

6075
04:58:00,620 --> 04:58:02,180
I don't know.

6076
04:58:05,360 --> 04:58:06,920
She sells.

6077
04:58:08,240 --> 04:58:08,480
Yep.

6078
04:58:11,120 --> 04:58:11,940
Let's just sell.

6079
04:58:13,220 --> 04:58:13,480
Yeah.

6080
04:58:14,000 --> 04:58:14,340
Yes.

6081
04:58:17,400 --> 04:58:18,020
Okay.

6082
04:58:20,460 --> 04:58:20,780
Oh shit.

6083
04:58:22,460 --> 04:58:23,860
Okay.

6084
04:58:28,100 --> 04:58:29,180
Okay.

6085
04:58:33,000 --> 04:58:33,340
Yeah.

6086
04:58:38,820 --> 04:58:40,220
Okay.

6087
04:58:50,780 --> 04:58:51,940
Yeah, maybe we can jump.

6088
04:58:52,160 --> 04:58:55,940
We can try.

6089
04:58:56,100 --> 04:58:57,080
We can try.

6090
04:59:00,760 --> 04:59:06,120
She stood on the balcony inexplicably mimicking him hiccuping and amicably welcoming him in.

6091
04:59:14,360 --> 04:59:18,440
Yeah, I wonder... I'm pretty... I'm almost positive it was jump back.

6092
04:59:18,440 --> 04:59:19,140
Right?

6093
04:59:19,560 --> 04:59:22,400
The command that I had was jump back command.

6094
04:59:22,600 --> 04:59:25,700
But that thing follows me until I stop running.

6095
04:59:26,480 --> 04:59:30,040
Which... like it doesn't like go for a little bit at least from what I know.

6096
04:59:30,960 --> 04:59:32,500
At least from how we've done it.

6097
04:59:33,280 --> 04:59:34,020
Thank you Legado!

6098
04:59:34,420 --> 04:59:35,340
Thanks for 10 months!

6099
04:59:36,180 --> 04:59:37,060
Thank you.

6100
04:59:37,340 --> 04:59:37,840
Let's see.

6101
04:59:40,500 --> 04:59:42,120
The dodge wouldn't... didn't work.

6102
04:59:43,160 --> 04:59:43,860
Number one.

6103
04:59:45,440 --> 04:59:45,720
Oh.

6104
04:59:48,620 --> 04:59:49,140
Flee.

6105
04:59:49,140 --> 04:59:49,660
Approach.

6106
04:59:50,220 --> 04:59:50,600
Recover.

6107
04:59:50,760 --> 04:59:51,160
Dodge.

6108
04:59:51,420 --> 04:59:51,780
Forward.

6109
04:59:52,220 --> 04:59:54,040
Oh wait, where the hell is it?

6110
04:59:58,240 --> 04:59:59,260
Jump back.

6111
04:59:59,540 --> 05:00:01,080
Yeah, so it was jump back.

6112
05:00:02,240 --> 05:00:05,820
But all she does is she jumps in place and then goes back.

6113
05:00:09,860 --> 05:00:13,380
I think we could still get the heal left behind but I don't...

6114
05:00:13,380 --> 05:00:16,020
I don't want to go fight that.

6115
05:00:16,180 --> 05:00:17,080
I don't... whoopsie.

6116
05:00:17,400 --> 05:00:19,440
I don't want to go fight anything else.

6117
05:00:19,780 --> 05:00:20,740
I also looked it up.

6118
05:00:20,820 --> 05:00:22,900
It's case 3 that we need to get to.

6119
05:00:23,900 --> 05:00:24,880
Case... whoops.

6120
05:00:26,340 --> 05:00:27,400
Case 3.

6121
05:00:30,140 --> 05:00:31,400
Is the important one.

6122
05:00:32,700 --> 05:00:33,680
Case 3.

6123
05:00:35,420 --> 05:00:36,340
Oh, stop.

6124
05:00:37,420 --> 05:00:37,820
Stop!

6125
05:00:38,820 --> 05:00:39,520
Save point.

6126
05:00:41,180 --> 05:00:42,940
I want to save since we just healed.

6127
05:00:44,840 --> 05:00:46,600
I want to save since we just healed.

6128
05:00:46,900 --> 05:00:50,700
So at least if I die and come back we can at least have full health from the get go.

6129
05:00:52,320 --> 05:00:54,080
Have you tried telling her get good?

6130
05:00:54,900 --> 05:00:56,280
That's a great command.

6131
05:00:56,420 --> 05:00:57,460
They should add that to the game.

6132
05:00:58,280 --> 05:01:02,240
Get good Rio and then she... wait there should be a lock in Rio.

6133
05:01:03,460 --> 05:01:05,980
There should be a lock in and then she's like OK.

6134
05:01:10,280 --> 05:01:12,540
There should be a lock in Rio.

6135
05:01:13,720 --> 05:01:14,860
Alright, case 3.

6136
05:01:19,760 --> 05:01:23,100
I just don't know how many things we are having to fight.

6137
05:01:25,540 --> 05:01:28,020
Like truly, especially because it's switching around.

6138
05:01:29,980 --> 05:01:30,280
Mouth.

6139
05:01:31,640 --> 05:01:32,440
Auto fire.

6140
05:01:34,700 --> 05:01:35,300
Flea.

6141
05:01:36,100 --> 05:01:36,740
Woo!

6142
05:01:42,120 --> 05:01:42,760
Stomach.

6143
05:01:46,200 --> 05:01:47,200
Enemy 3.

6144
05:01:48,300 --> 05:01:48,860
Mouth.

6145
05:01:49,880 --> 05:01:50,300
Mouth.

6146
05:01:51,380 --> 05:01:57,160
It doesn't work Rio if you miss.

6147
05:01:57,640 --> 05:01:59,560
Rio it doesn't work if you miss.

6148
05:01:59,860 --> 05:02:01,860
Rio we can't win if you miss.

6149
05:02:03,260 --> 05:02:05,540
Rio wouldn't miss a shot if she just locked in.

6150
05:02:05,600 --> 05:02:06,380
That's what I'm saying.

6151
05:02:06,380 --> 05:02:11,380
I think the programmers of this game are evil for allowing you to...

6152
05:02:11,380 --> 05:02:13,220
Like what is the percentage of her missing?

6153
05:02:13,720 --> 05:02:14,140
I wonder.

6154
05:02:15,360 --> 05:02:19,980
What is the percentage of her like missing the shot every time.

6155
05:02:23,920 --> 05:02:24,620
Strafe.

6156
05:02:26,120 --> 05:02:26,880
Oh shit.

6157
05:02:28,160 --> 05:02:28,760

6158
05:02:30,920 --> 05:02:31,620
Strafe.

6159
05:02:33,380 --> 05:02:34,380
Jump back.

6160
05:02:36,380 --> 05:02:37,320
She didn't even go back.

6161
05:02:37,460 --> 05:02:38,520
She didn't even go back.

6162
05:02:39,380 --> 05:02:40,080
Flea.

6163
05:02:47,760 --> 05:02:48,480

6164
05:02:50,540 --> 05:02:51,940

6169
05:03:00,400 --> 05:03:00,720
Oh no.

6170
05:03:00,860 --> 05:03:01,120
Oh shit.

6171
05:03:01,220 --> 05:03:01,420
Oh shit.

6172
05:03:01,540 --> 05:03:01,660
Oh shit.

05:03:02,120 --> 05:03:03,220

6175
05:03:06,060 --> 05:03:07,460
Run away from that thing first.

6176
05:03:08,480 --> 05:03:09,200
Flea.

6177
05:03:09,200 --> 05:03:10,700

6178
05:03:10,920 --> 05:03:11,600

6180
05:03:13,820 --> 05:03:14,840

Turn around.

6182
05:03:19,920 --> 05:03:20,660
Turn around.

6183
05:03:22,180 --> 05:03:23,300

05:04:08,880 --> 05:04:09,600
I know.

6213
05:04:09,680 --> 05:04:11,980
Can you imagine having to find ammo in this game?

6214
05:04:12,920 --> 05:04:13,180
Right.

6215
05:04:15,960 --> 05:04:16,840
Move right.

6216
05:04:18,620 --> 05:04:19,520

No.

6218
05:04:20,960 --> 05:04:21,700
That's not what I said.

6219
05:04:21,920 --> 05:04:22,460
Where are you going?

6220
05:04:22,700 --> 05:04:23,340

You can do a barrel roll.

6236
05:05:04,980 --> 05:05:05,520

Yeah.

6241
05:05:17,820 --> 05:05:18,700
We are in the end game.

6242
05:05:19,100 --> 05:05:19,500

6243
05:05:26,000 --> 05:05:26,780
Can we?

6244
05:05:26,900 --> 05:05:27,760
Can we move on?

6245
05:05:29,020 --> 05:05:30,600
Are we actually able to move on?

6246
05:05:32,120 --> 05:05:33,400
Hurry.

6247
05:05:33,800 --> 05:05:34,480

See if I shoot the body, you guys.

6265
05:06:25,570 --> 05:06:25,850
Body.

6266
05:06:27,310 --> 05:06:27,590
Flee.

6267
05:06:28,630 --> 05:06:29,810
Trying to make a point.

6268
05:06:30,430 --> 05:06:31,050
Doesn't work.

6269
05:06:31,410 --> 05:06:32,470
Shooting the body does nothing.

6270
05:06:32,470 --> 05:06:33,170

05:06:47,750 --> 05:06:48,130
Flee.

6277
05:06:51,610 --> 05:06:52,810
Nice, nice, nice.

6278
05:06:54,590 --> 05:06:55,730
Dodge right.

6279
05:06:56,410 --> 05:06:57,510
Dodge right.

6280
05:06:58,150 --> 05:06:59,250
Dodge right.

6281
05:07:00,250 --> 05:07:01,330
Tail.

6282
05:07:02,070 --> 05:07:03,470
Tail.

6283
05:07:05,110 --> 05:07:05,530
Shoot.

6284
05:07:05,990 --> 05:07:07,170
Shoot.

6285
05:07:07,950 --> 05:07:08,650
Shoot.

6286
05:07:09,110 --> 05:07:10,230
Shoot.

6287
05:07:12,130 --> 05:07:14,090
Oh my gosh.

6288
05:07:15,310 --> 05:07:16,150
Reload.

6289
05:07:17,090 --> 05:07:17,510
Shoot.

6290
05:07:19,310 --> 05:07:20,910
Dodge right.

6291
05:07:21,310 --> 05:07:22,410
Shoot.

6292
05:07:23,430 --> 05:07:24,330
Dodge right.

6293
05:07:25,030 --> 05:07:25,730
Shoot.

6294
05:07:26,710 --> 05:07:27,710
Dodge right.

6295
05:07:28,490 --> 05:07:29,530
Dodge right.

6296
05:07:30,210 --> 05:07:30,910
Shoot.

6297
05:07:32,290 --> 05:07:33,410
Dodge right.

6298
05:07:52,510 --> 05:07:53,510
Right eye.

6299
05:07:54,650 --> 05:07:55,610
Left eye.

6300
05:07:56,590 --> 05:07:57,430
Middle eye.

6301
05:07:58,650 --> 05:07:59,910
Red eye.

6302
05:08:00,690 --> 05:08:01,410
Red eye.

6303
05:08:02,890 --> 05:08:03,790
Red eye.

6304
05:08:04,790 --> 05:08:05,670
Mouse.

6305
05:08:06,470 --> 05:08:07,590
Mouse.

6306
05:08:08,710 --> 05:08:09,250
Mouth.

6307
05:08:10,770 --> 05:08:16,130
I wish we could get something like the first boss with the spider where I really only had to time it.

6308
05:08:17,210 --> 05:08:19,710
The final boss is going to be absolute hell.

6309
05:08:20,310 --> 05:08:20,930
No heal.

6310
05:08:21,490 --> 05:08:22,370
No grenades.

6311
05:08:23,150 --> 05:08:23,670
We are

6312
05:08:28,690 --> 05:08:33,390
going to actually go through it.

6313
05:08:34,130 --> 05:08:35,290
I might actually quit.

6314
05:08:35,390 --> 05:08:35,990
I don't know yet.

6315
05:08:37,550 --> 05:08:38,250
I don't know.

6316
05:08:38,310 --> 05:08:39,230
I might actually quit.

6317
05:08:40,690 --> 05:08:41,750
Tail.

6318
05:08:45,010 --> 05:08:47,830
I don't...I'm trying to.

6319
05:08:49,870 --> 05:08:51,310
Dodge right.

6320
05:08:52,510 --> 05:08:53,110
Dodge right.

6321
05:08:54,490 --> 05:08:54,890
Tail.

6322
05:08:55,930 --> 05:08:56,350
Tail.

6323
05:08:56,590 --> 05:08:57,730
Here he comes.

6324
05:08:59,980 --> 05:09:00,510
Tail.

6325
05:09:07,690 --> 05:09:08,250
Left eye.

6326
05:09:09,180 --> 05:09:10,030
Right eye.

6327
05:09:11,230 --> 05:09:11,910
Right eye.

6328
05:09:12,270 --> 05:09:13,130
Shoot.

6329
05:09:13,130 --> 05:09:15,210
Left eye.

6330
05:09:15,790 --> 05:09:16,830
Shoot.

6331
05:09:17,730 --> 05:09:18,830
Middle eye.

6332
05:09:19,810 --> 05:09:20,490
Shoot.

6333
05:09:21,790 --> 05:09:22,850
Oh, OK.

6334
05:09:23,170 --> 05:09:23,670
Yeah, that's good.

6335
05:09:24,990 --> 05:09:26,030
Shoot.

6336
05:09:27,270 --> 05:09:28,250
Red eye.

6337
05:09:29,830 --> 05:09:30,410
Mouth.

6338
05:09:31,410 --> 05:09:31,990
Auto fire.

6339
05:09:35,070 --> 05:09:35,890
Auto fire.

6340
05:09:36,310 --> 05:09:37,230
Oh shit.

6341
05:09:37,970 --> 05:09:39,350
Auto fire.

6342
05:09:39,350 --> 05:09:40,350
Auto fire.

6343
05:09:41,450 --> 05:09:42,170
OK.

6344
05:09:42,430 --> 05:09:42,650
Flee.

6345
05:09:44,470 --> 05:09:45,490
What the hell?

6346
05:09:45,690 --> 05:09:46,110
What is this?

6347
05:09:46,610 --> 05:09:47,370
I can't see anything.

6348
05:09:50,010 --> 05:09:50,730
Tail.

6349
05:09:52,990 --> 05:09:53,710
Flee.

6350
05:09:56,630 --> 05:09:57,350
Oh shoot.

6351
05:09:58,190 --> 05:09:59,450
Dodge right.

6352
05:10:00,170 --> 05:10:01,170
Dodge left.

6353
05:10:02,030 --> 05:10:02,690
Dodge left.

6354
05:10:04,170 --> 05:10:04,890
Tail.

6355
05:10:04,890 --> 05:10:06,050
Tail.

6356
05:10:06,490 --> 05:10:07,710
Tail.

6357
05:10:08,510 --> 05:10:09,150
Shoot.

6358
05:10:10,030 --> 05:10:10,670
Shoot.

6359
05:10:11,510 --> 05:10:12,070
Shoot.

6360
05:10:12,970 --> 05:10:13,410
Shoot.

6361
05:10:14,370 --> 05:10:16,090
Oh, reload.

6362
05:10:17,670 --> 05:10:18,230
Damn it.

6363
05:10:19,610 --> 05:10:20,890
Shoot.

6364
05:10:22,970 --> 05:10:23,950
Oh, did we get it?

6365
05:10:25,670 --> 05:10:27,370
Oh my god.

6366
05:10:27,710 --> 05:10:27,890
Yeah.

6367
05:10:29,670 --> 05:10:30,690
Save point.

6368
05:10:31,810 --> 05:10:32,250
Actually, stop.

6369
05:10:33,390 --> 05:10:34,510
She sells.

6370
05:10:35,810 --> 05:10:36,890
Just in case.

6371
05:10:38,150 --> 05:10:38,950
Just in case.

6372
05:10:39,270 --> 05:10:39,630
Yes.

6373
05:10:41,170 --> 05:10:42,010
Just in case.

6374
05:10:42,850 --> 05:10:43,750
Just in case.

6375
05:10:44,190 --> 05:10:44,590
Just in case.

6376
05:10:46,030 --> 05:10:47,330
What was it?

6377
05:10:50,230 --> 05:10:52,270
Ted threw Fred three free throws.

6378
05:10:59,010 --> 05:11:00,610
Oh my god.

6379
05:11:03,310 --> 05:11:03,870
OK.

6380
05:11:05,070 --> 05:11:06,850
Sheep shouldn't sleep in a shack.

6381
05:11:07,130 --> 05:11:08,470
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

6382
05:11:09,090 --> 05:11:11,110
She needs to get like new tongue twisters.

6383
05:11:11,110 --> 05:11:13,390
Repeat after me.

6384
05:11:14,190 --> 05:11:15,650
Betty Batter had some butter.

6385
05:11:15,790 --> 05:11:17,330
But she said this butter's bitter.

6386
05:11:17,570 --> 05:11:20,410
If I bake this butter butter, it would make my batter bitter.

6387
05:11:21,790 --> 05:11:22,790
OK, your turn.

6388
05:11:24,410 --> 05:11:25,710
Betty Batter had some butter.

6389
05:11:25,950 --> 05:11:27,310
But she said this butter's bitter.

6390
05:11:27,490 --> 05:11:30,210
If I bake this bitter butter, it would make my batter bitter.

6391
05:11:30,650 --> 05:11:31,130
Awesome.

6392
05:11:31,530 --> 05:11:32,010
Awesome.

6393
05:11:33,710 --> 05:11:35,490
Her tongue twisters are old, Mia.

6394
05:11:36,670 --> 05:11:37,150
Thanks.

6395
05:11:37,570 --> 05:11:38,490
I really needed that.

6396
05:11:38,490 --> 05:11:40,250
Alright, one more.

6397
05:11:41,070 --> 05:11:42,710
She sells.

6398
05:11:46,970 --> 05:11:47,510
Yes.

6399
05:11:49,150 --> 05:11:49,850
Drop the beat.

6400
05:11:53,670 --> 05:11:55,210
Ragged rascal ran.

6401
05:11:59,190 --> 05:12:02,030
Around the rugged rocks, the ragged rascal ran.

6402
05:12:03,550 --> 05:12:04,110
Awesome.

6403
05:12:04,730 --> 05:12:06,450
She is so tiny, huh?

6404
05:12:08,490 --> 05:12:09,670
A noise annoys an oyster.

6405
05:12:10,470 --> 05:12:12,730
But a noisy noise annoys an oyster more.

6406
05:12:14,190 --> 05:12:15,170
OK, your turn.

6407
05:12:16,650 --> 05:12:18,170
A noise annoys an oyster.

6408
05:12:18,410 --> 05:12:20,810
But a noisy noise annoys an oyster more.

6409
05:12:21,290 --> 05:12:21,790
Awesome.

6410
05:12:22,190 --> 05:12:22,710
Awesome.

6411
05:12:24,190 --> 05:12:25,290
Repeat after me.

6412
05:12:26,830 --> 05:12:29,590
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

6413
05:12:29,970 --> 05:12:32,730
A woodchuck would chuck as much as he could chuck if a woodchuck could.

6414
05:12:34,130 --> 05:12:35,170
OK, your turn.

6415
05:12:36,310 --> 05:12:39,330
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

6416
05:12:39,710 --> 05:12:42,490
A woodchuck would chuck as much as he could chuck if a woodchuck could.

6417
05:12:43,710 --> 05:12:44,150
Awesome.

6418
05:12:45,450 --> 05:12:45,790
Hello?

6419
05:12:48,350 --> 05:12:51,330
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

6420
05:12:51,650 --> 05:12:54,830
A woodchuck would chuck as much as he could chuck if a woodchuck could.

6421
05:12:55,490 --> 05:12:55,970
Not bad.

6422
05:13:00,450 --> 05:13:01,670
Wow, you did it.

6423
05:13:02,610 --> 05:13:03,050
Thanks.

6424
05:13:06,210 --> 05:13:08,570
Finally an action game tougher than DMC3.

6425
05:13:10,510 --> 05:13:11,890
Where are we anyway?

6426
05:13:12,310 --> 05:13:15,770
We are so close to case 3 and we are very far from save point.

6427
05:13:15,950 --> 05:13:16,730
So I am very scared.

6428
05:13:17,150 --> 05:13:18,330
But we will still try to save.

6429
05:13:19,170 --> 05:13:20,030
Save point.

6430
05:13:22,510 --> 05:13:26,610
Can't imagine how you will play this game if you never knew about the tongue twister heal mechanic.

6431
05:13:27,630 --> 05:13:29,350
I actually would have given up.

6432
05:13:31,310 --> 05:13:33,670
I would have actually 100% given up.

6433
05:13:34,070 --> 05:13:35,270
Anti-JRPG.

6434
05:13:35,490 --> 05:13:38,310
Instead of preparing for the boss battle, Ryo spends everything she did.

6435
05:13:41,210 --> 05:13:42,890
I don't think it would be possible.

6436
05:13:43,430 --> 05:13:44,870
Like... I don't know.

6437
05:13:45,150 --> 05:13:46,170
I don't know.

6438
05:13:46,310 --> 05:13:47,890
They... I don't know.

6439
05:13:49,750 --> 05:13:50,830
I have no idea.

6440
05:13:52,270 --> 05:13:52,790
Wait.

6441
05:13:53,010 --> 05:13:53,930
I have to.

6442
05:13:54,130 --> 05:13:54,690
I have to.

6443
05:13:54,770 --> 05:13:55,970
Even though she wasted a grenade.

6444
05:13:55,970 --> 05:13:59,890
She wasted a grenade on a guy who had 2 health.

6445
05:14:00,610 --> 05:14:02,210
She really is just throwing.

6446
05:14:02,570 --> 05:14:03,790
I truly believe.

6447
05:14:09,830 --> 05:14:10,830
Case 3.

6448
05:14:12,250 --> 05:14:13,890
I wonder if we have gotten everything though.

6449
05:14:13,970 --> 05:14:14,450
I guess we will see.

6450
05:14:15,830 --> 05:14:18,430
I don't know if we have fought everything.

6451
05:14:19,010 --> 05:14:20,770
If we did, that's pretty cool.

6452
05:14:21,870 --> 05:14:24,030
That would be really splendid and grand.

6453
05:14:24,030 --> 05:14:25,210
Oh my gosh!

6454
05:14:25,270 --> 05:14:25,450
Wait!

6455
05:14:25,490 --> 05:14:26,250
We made it!

6456
05:14:47,410 --> 05:14:48,810
The music is a bop.

6457
05:14:57,130 --> 05:14:57,630
What?

6458
05:14:58,110 --> 05:14:58,890
What does that mean?

6459
05:14:59,010 --> 05:14:59,510
Is that a bomb?

6460
05:15:00,210 --> 05:15:00,950
Is that a bomb?

6461
05:15:01,630 --> 05:15:07,230
P-B-X This amalgam of high...

6462
05:15:07,230 --> 05:15:07,330
Oh.

6463
05:15:08,450 --> 05:15:09,250
I can't.

6464
05:15:11,490 --> 05:15:12,350
Time fuse.

6465
05:15:12,810 --> 05:15:15,450
The time fuse can be turned off by entering passcodes.

6466
05:15:15,830 --> 05:15:17,970
Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.

6467
05:15:20,990 --> 05:15:23,630
The sum of the last digits of today's date.

6468
05:15:31,870 --> 05:15:34,450
Today is like my computer date.

6469
05:15:37,070 --> 05:15:37,630
Wait.

6470
05:15:37,750 --> 05:15:38,530
Hold on.

6471
05:15:38,610 --> 05:15:41,130
The sum of the last digits.

6472
05:15:41,230 --> 05:15:41,410
Wait.

6473
05:15:41,790 --> 05:15:42,070
No, no, no.

6474
05:15:42,230 --> 05:15:42,910
It's 12.

6475
05:15:43,150 --> 05:15:44,110
It was Christmas.

6476
05:15:44,430 --> 05:15:45,170
So 25.

6477
05:15:46,110 --> 05:15:47,190
What's the year?

6478
05:15:47,350 --> 05:15:47,610
30?

6479
05:15:48,030 --> 05:15:48,650
I don't know.

6480
05:15:56,790 --> 05:15:57,350
15?

6481
05:15:59,150 --> 05:15:59,710
15.

6482
05:16:03,550 --> 05:16:04,110
15.

6483
05:16:07,190 --> 05:16:12,850
Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.

6484
05:16:23,950 --> 05:16:26,050
If it's so easy, then do it.

6485
05:16:26,730 --> 05:16:28,330
If it's so easy, then do it.

6486
05:16:28,330 --> 05:16:31,490
2, 4, 9, 15.

6487
05:16:34,770 --> 05:16:35,790
15, right?

6488
05:16:36,050 --> 05:16:36,570
Am I right?

6489
05:16:36,990 --> 05:16:37,610
Am I correct?

6490
05:16:38,070 --> 05:16:38,390
15.

6491
05:16:39,350 --> 05:16:39,710
Sorry.

6492
05:16:40,090 --> 05:16:40,590
Oh my gosh.

6493
05:16:42,890 --> 05:16:43,250
Yes.

6494
05:16:52,950 --> 05:16:55,650
Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.

6495
05:16:57,950 --> 05:17:00,990
Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.

6496
05:17:06,750 --> 05:17:07,490
OK.

6497
05:17:10,590 --> 05:17:11,370
She told me.

6498
05:17:11,550 --> 05:17:11,970
13.

6499
05:17:14,670 --> 05:17:16,170
I'm working on it.

6500
05:17:17,570 --> 05:17:18,170
13.

6501
05:17:18,790 --> 05:17:18,950
What?

6502
05:17:21,370 --> 05:17:22,250
It's not?

6503
05:17:30,990 --> 05:17:32,510
Rio, you almost had us.

6504
05:17:32,550 --> 05:17:35,550
You told us to check carefully and you almost had us exploded.

6505
05:17:36,090 --> 05:17:36,550
Right now.

6506
05:17:38,390 --> 05:17:39,130
Tanaka's note.

6507
05:17:40,710 --> 05:17:41,450
50 guests.

6508
05:17:41,810 --> 05:17:42,610
I got it.

6509
05:17:48,510 --> 05:17:49,070
Fuse.

6510
05:17:50,110 --> 05:17:51,330
It won't let me select it.

6511
05:17:51,950 --> 05:17:53,390
It won't let me select it.

6512
05:17:53,930 --> 05:17:54,270
Fuse.

6513
05:17:54,910 --> 05:17:55,470
Fuse.

6514
05:17:57,610 --> 05:17:59,250
It won't let me select it for real.

6515
05:17:59,470 --> 05:18:00,270
How do I select it?

6516
05:18:00,890 --> 05:18:01,390
Oh there we go.

6517
05:18:01,430 --> 05:18:01,870
Oh my gosh.

6518
05:18:02,510 --> 05:18:03,290
Oh my god.

6519
05:18:08,450 --> 05:18:10,270
I had to press triangle.

6520
05:18:12,670 --> 05:18:12,970
OK.

6521
05:18:17,290 --> 05:18:20,990
Enter the sum of the last digits of PM Takayama's birthday.

6522
05:18:21,970 --> 05:18:22,110
Oh.

6523
05:18:22,370 --> 05:18:25,970
Enter the sum of the last digits of PM Takayama's birthday.

6524
05:18:25,970 --> 05:18:28,010
What's that?

6525
05:18:28,830 --> 05:18:30,990
How are we supposed to know the Prime Minister's birthday?

6526
05:18:31,310 --> 05:18:31,870
I don't know.

6527
05:18:34,030 --> 05:18:35,310
What do we do?

6528
05:18:35,890 --> 05:18:36,410
What do we do?

6529
05:18:36,830 --> 05:18:37,370
What do we do?

6530
05:18:38,790 --> 05:18:40,170
Me this entire stream.

6531
05:18:42,370 --> 05:18:43,310
It's hopeless.

6532
05:18:44,330 --> 05:18:45,230
Me this entire stream.

6533
05:18:45,250 --> 05:18:46,070
I don't know his birthday.

6534
05:18:47,550 --> 05:18:48,550
What do I do?

6535
05:18:50,710 --> 05:18:52,070
We came so close.

6536
05:19:03,110 --> 05:19:04,250
Guess we die.

6537
05:19:06,430 --> 05:19:07,690
I have no idea.

6538
05:19:09,590 --> 05:19:10,570
It's OK.

6539
05:19:11,670 --> 05:19:12,850
We got this.

6540
05:19:14,290 --> 05:19:15,430
Let's go ask him.

6541
05:19:19,570 --> 05:19:19,970
I am?

6542
05:19:24,050 --> 05:19:24,910
I did?

6543
05:19:25,150 --> 05:19:25,430
He did?

6544
05:19:31,590 --> 05:19:32,690
Oh my god.

6545
05:19:32,730 --> 05:19:35,090
Detective Conan over here.

6546
05:19:35,670 --> 05:19:36,670
Bazinga!

6547
05:19:48,530 --> 05:19:50,290
OK GameFAQs.

6548
05:19:50,310 --> 05:19:50,910
Do your thing.

6550
05:19:55,150 --> 05:19:57,350
He said something about that.

6551
05:19:57,990 --> 05:19:59,030
Let's see.

6552
05:19:59,030 --> 05:19:59,070
Let's see.

6553
05:20:01,810 --> 05:20:05,270
Tell her to check the DVD.

6554
05:20:06,190 --> 05:20:07,650
It has footage of his birthday.

6555
05:20:07,830 --> 05:20:08,530
It does?

6556
05:20:09,170 --> 05:20:10,970
It's today and he's 60.

6557
05:20:11,330 --> 05:20:13,050
I didn't tell her that at all.

6558
05:20:15,210 --> 05:20:15,770
What?

6559
05:20:16,870 --> 05:20:17,430
GameFAQs.

6560
05:20:17,430 --> 05:20:18,510
How am I supposed to...

6561
05:20:18,510 --> 05:20:18,770
What?

6562
05:20:18,950 --> 05:20:19,150
Wait.

6563
05:20:19,230 --> 05:20:19,750
Let me tell her.

6564
05:20:20,570 --> 05:20:21,730
Check the DVD.

6565
05:20:26,070 --> 05:20:27,470
Check video disc.

6566
05:20:30,630 --> 05:20:32,410
Check video disc.

6567
05:20:34,790 --> 05:20:36,270
Video disc.

6568
05:20:36,950 --> 05:20:37,870

6569
05:20:39,710 --> 05:20:40,590

6570
05:20:41,290 --> 05:20:42,470
Check the DVD.

6571
05:20:43,130 --> 05:20:44,830
Search video disc.

6572
05:20:46,370 --> 05:20:47,650
Check the CD.

6573
05:20:50,230 --> 05:20:51,110
Check...

6574
05:20:51,110 --> 05:20:51,990
Footage.

6575
05:20:54,330 --> 05:20:55,210
OK.

6576
05:20:55,370 --> 05:20:55,810
Fuck this.

6577
05:20:55,910 --> 05:20:57,310
I'm going with GameFAQs.

6578
05:20:57,330 --> 05:20:57,870
What did they tell me?

6579
05:20:57,870 --> 05:20:59,750
They told me...

6580
05:21:01,600 --> 05:21:02,730
What is it?

6581
05:21:02,910 --> 05:21:03,830
Summon this thing?

6582
05:21:04,470 --> 05:21:05,790
Character insert is 15.

6583
05:21:06,030 --> 05:21:06,650
We're speedrunning.

6584
05:21:07,870 --> 05:21:08,450
Useless.

6585
05:21:08,610 --> 05:21:09,150
You're useless.

6586
05:21:17,150 --> 05:21:18,050
Useless Ryo.

6587
05:21:18,350 --> 05:21:19,390
So useless.

6588
05:21:20,130 --> 05:21:24,490
I wonder if I have to throw that into the final monster's mouth, I imagine, right?

6589
05:21:25,210 --> 05:21:25,950
Because it's a bomb.

6590
05:21:27,870 --> 05:21:28,570
Don't drop it.

6591
05:21:28,830 --> 05:21:29,710
Don't drop it.

6592
05:21:29,730 --> 05:21:30,290
Oh my gosh, Ryo.

6593
05:21:30,950 --> 05:21:31,870
Don't drop it.

6594
05:21:35,170 --> 05:21:35,730
Yeah.

6595
05:21:36,570 --> 05:21:38,970
I thought you'd never ask.

6596
05:21:48,100 --> 05:21:49,980
Ryo, I'm so tired.

6597
05:21:58,720 --> 05:22:00,600
So sentimental all of a sudden.

6598
05:22:02,480 --> 05:22:04,200
My guide said to relax.

6599
05:22:11,440 --> 05:22:12,560
I know.

6600
05:22:13,060 --> 05:22:13,900
Yeah, you would be.

6601
05:22:14,240 --> 05:22:14,700
For 100%.

6602
05:22:17,060 --> 05:22:18,700
100% you would be dead.

6603
05:22:20,660 --> 05:22:21,220
1000%.

6604
05:22:30,600 --> 05:22:33,100
Can you imagine Ryo in a long distance relationship?

6605
05:22:35,600 --> 05:22:36,600
Hello, boyfriend.

6606
05:22:36,820 --> 05:22:38,040
Should I brush my teeth today?

6607
05:22:41,560 --> 05:22:43,480
This is such a death flag.

6608
05:22:45,740 --> 05:22:46,980
Oh, death flag.

6609
05:22:52,560 --> 05:22:53,680
Of course.

6610
05:22:54,560 --> 05:22:55,660
If we get back.

6611
05:22:57,300 --> 05:22:58,600
This is someone's death flag.

6612
05:22:58,660 --> 05:22:59,780
It's either hers or mine.

6613
05:23:02,860 --> 05:23:03,940
Wee woo, wee woo.

6614
05:23:04,160 --> 05:23:04,980
Wee woo, wee woo.

6615
05:23:07,840 --> 05:23:10,000
We haven't heard from her in a long time.

6616
05:23:10,400 --> 05:23:13,860
We haven't heard from her in a really long time, Ryo.

6617
05:23:15,720 --> 05:23:16,160
Woah!

6618
05:23:31,500 --> 05:23:33,600
Holy mother of...

6619
05:23:38,120 --> 05:23:40,280
Oh she's back!

6620
05:23:42,940 --> 05:23:46,160
Our guns are useless against her.

6621
05:23:53,630 --> 05:23:54,950
Oh yeah!

6622
05:23:58,410 --> 05:24:00,350
Does that count as a save?

6623
05:24:01,430 --> 05:24:02,610
I would hope so.

6624
05:24:08,270 --> 05:24:11,390
They weren't a rescue team.

6625
05:24:15,710 --> 05:24:17,450
They're after the stone too.

6626
05:24:17,830 --> 05:24:19,030
The Philosopher's Stone!

6627
05:24:20,590 --> 05:24:21,970
She who shall not be named.

6628
05:24:22,950 --> 05:24:23,470
She's running.

6629
05:24:25,930 --> 05:24:26,910
I'm gonna keep running.

6630
05:24:27,290 --> 05:24:30,270
Keep running.

6631
05:24:30,270 --> 05:24:30,370
Keep running.

6632
05:24:39,030 --> 05:24:40,710
The Philosopher's Legacy.

6633
05:24:43,950 --> 05:24:45,070
Shit her?

6634
05:24:46,030 --> 05:24:47,970
Number 2 in her mouth!

6635
05:24:52,750 --> 05:24:55,210
A rocket on a person?

6636
05:24:55,390 --> 05:24:55,850
Not a human.

6637
05:25:01,830 --> 05:25:02,830
Shut her panel.

6638
05:25:03,650 --> 05:25:04,430
Close.

6639
05:25:10,990 --> 05:25:14,490
Oh no, it didn't work.

6640
05:25:25,090 --> 05:25:27,970
What is that?

6641
05:25:28,370 --> 05:25:28,750
Red.

6642
05:25:31,470 --> 05:25:34,190
Red lever.

6643
05:25:36,010 --> 05:25:37,030
Yeah.

6644
05:25:38,810 --> 05:25:39,950
Red lever.

6645
05:25:41,830 --> 05:25:42,930
I don't know.

6646
05:25:44,350 --> 05:25:45,810
Shoot red lever.

6647
05:25:48,610 --> 05:25:49,970
Nice.

6648
05:25:52,350 --> 05:25:53,710
Yeah.

6649
05:25:56,130 --> 05:25:57,190
Ok.

6650
05:25:58,510 --> 05:25:59,570
Shoot red lever.

6651
05:26:01,990 --> 05:26:02,670
Nice.

6652
05:26:03,350 --> 05:26:04,450
Shoot yellow lever.

6653
05:26:06,010 --> 05:26:07,090
I can't speak.

6654
05:26:07,690 --> 05:26:09,390
Shoot yellow lever.

6655
05:26:11,530 --> 05:26:12,190
Oh no, no, no.

6656
05:26:12,970 --> 05:26:13,590
Wait.

6657
05:26:13,970 --> 05:26:14,870
Shoot red lever.

6658
05:26:15,930 --> 05:26:17,450
I think I have to go for the red.

6659
05:26:17,950 --> 05:26:19,010
Shoot red lever.

6660
05:26:20,230 --> 05:26:21,150
Shoot red lever.

6661
05:26:21,550 --> 05:26:21,990
Oh my gosh.

6662
05:26:22,470 --> 05:26:23,290
No, no, no.

6663
05:26:23,690 --> 05:26:24,650
Shoot red lever.

6664
05:26:26,430 --> 05:26:27,050
Ouch.

6665
05:26:28,490 --> 05:26:29,730
Shoot red lever.

6666
05:26:30,990 --> 05:26:31,570
Stop!

6667
05:26:33,070 --> 05:26:34,550
Guys, I'm confused.

6668
05:26:34,670 --> 05:26:35,470
Am I doing this right?

6669
05:26:35,470 --> 05:26:36,430
What the hell is happening?

6670
05:26:36,630 --> 05:26:38,250
I think I have to shoot whatever is on top, right?

6671
05:26:38,350 --> 05:26:40,170
Are they shooting it too?

6672
05:26:40,530 --> 05:26:41,310
Oh my God.

6673
05:26:41,370 --> 05:26:41,970
I think I'm getting it.

6674
05:26:42,590 --> 05:26:43,590
Shoot yellow lever.

6675
05:26:45,390 --> 05:26:46,290
Shoot yellow.

6676
05:26:48,510 --> 05:26:49,070
Yes.

6677
05:26:49,590 --> 05:26:50,330
Shoot yellow.

6678
05:26:51,350 --> 05:26:52,490
Shoot yellow lever.

6679
05:26:53,650 --> 05:26:54,250
There we go.

6680
05:26:54,610 --> 05:26:55,590
Shoot yellow lever.

6681
05:26:56,790 --> 05:26:57,970
Shoot yellow lever.

6682
05:26:58,330 --> 05:26:59,450
Shoot yellow lever.

6683
05:27:02,290 --> 05:27:03,450
Shoot yellow lever.

6684
05:27:05,470 --> 05:27:05,870
No!

6685
05:27:06,070 --> 05:27:07,110
Shoot yellow lever.

6686
05:27:09,670 --> 05:27:11,030
Shoot yellow lever.

6687
05:27:12,570 --> 05:27:13,950
Shoot yellow lever.

6688
05:27:14,830 --> 05:27:16,290
Oh, I think we got it.

6689
05:27:16,530 --> 05:27:17,690
Oh my gosh, finally.

6690
05:27:19,310 --> 05:27:20,730
Shoot soldiers.

6691
05:27:21,710 --> 05:27:22,890
Seriously though.

6692
05:27:24,050 --> 05:27:24,630
Gosh.

6693
05:27:29,650 --> 05:27:30,370
Okay.

6694
05:27:38,050 --> 05:27:38,730
True.

6695
05:27:39,130 --> 05:27:39,930
Good thinking.

6696
05:27:40,490 --> 05:27:42,770
Wow, Rio used a brain cell for once.

6697
05:27:47,670 --> 05:27:48,350
Seriously?

6698
05:27:49,770 --> 05:27:51,670
Now is not the time.

6699
05:27:54,210 --> 05:27:57,690
Oh, Gino is about to die.

6700
05:28:01,390 --> 05:28:02,250
Uh-oh.

6701
05:28:05,940 --> 05:28:06,510
No!

6702
05:28:09,460 --> 05:28:10,390
Bye, Gino.

6703
05:28:14,280 --> 05:28:15,330
Bye, Gino.

6704
05:28:16,030 --> 05:28:17,950
Gino is dead meat.

6705
05:28:24,050 --> 05:28:25,550
Convince Gino.

6706
05:28:29,300 --> 05:28:29,870
Run.

6707
05:28:30,790 --> 05:28:31,670
Wait, seriously?

6708
05:28:31,850 --> 05:28:32,150
No!

6709
05:28:32,150 --> 05:28:33,990
This is... No, girl.

6710
05:28:34,170 --> 05:28:34,690
Girl, don't.

6711
05:28:35,050 --> 05:28:35,690
Girl, don't.

6712
05:28:38,090 --> 05:28:38,950
Are you serious?

6713
05:28:39,430 --> 05:28:42,130
It's gonna kill us and then I'm gonna have to do all of that over again.

6714
05:28:45,050 --> 05:28:45,530
No!

6715
05:28:46,110 --> 05:28:46,590
Please!

6716
05:28:58,690 --> 05:28:59,650
RIP Gino.

6717
05:28:59,650 --> 05:28:59,750
No!

6718
05:29:08,260 --> 05:29:10,900
I really do have to do all of that over again.

6719
05:29:11,100 --> 05:29:12,100
Are you kidding me?

6720
05:29:19,440 --> 05:29:20,640
I tried to tell her.

6721
05:29:20,640 --> 05:29:22,520
It was such a small amount of time.

6722
05:29:23,140 --> 05:29:26,540
You guys, it's such a small amount of time.

6723
05:29:29,820 --> 05:29:31,080
I'll just tell her to run.

6724
05:29:34,380 --> 05:29:35,320
Case 3.

6725
05:29:36,760 --> 05:29:39,540
Oh my gosh, I have to do all of this again too.

6726
05:29:39,720 --> 05:29:40,020
Run.

6727
05:29:41,380 --> 05:29:43,280
I have to do all of the inputs again too.

6728
05:29:44,000 --> 05:29:44,800
What was it?

6729
05:29:46,320 --> 05:29:46,600
15...

6730
05:29:47,900 --> 05:29:50,940
15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15.

6731
05:29:53,460 --> 05:29:54,760
Why didn't you save?

6732
05:29:55,040 --> 05:29:57,240
What the fuck?

6733
05:29:58,340 --> 05:29:59,100
Seriously, Lumen?

6734
05:29:59,100 --> 05:29:59,220
Lumen?

6735
05:30:01,580 --> 05:30:02,040
Seriously?

6736
05:30:03,220 --> 05:30:05,520
Tell me what opportunity it gave me to save.

6737
05:30:05,720 --> 05:30:05,860
Huh?

6738
05:30:06,640 --> 05:30:08,760
Tell me what opportunity it gave me to save.

6739
05:30:09,380 --> 05:30:09,860
Tell me.

6740
05:30:10,140 --> 05:30:10,940
Tell me right now.

6741
05:30:11,380 --> 05:30:12,540
And you better be correct!

6742
05:30:17,320 --> 05:30:18,040
I'm waiting.

6743
05:30:18,360 --> 05:30:19,900
I'm waiting for your response in chat.

6744
05:30:20,200 --> 05:30:21,220
I'm calling you out.

6745
05:30:29,760 --> 05:30:31,380
This can't be.

6746
05:30:32,120 --> 05:30:34,560
Listen, can you analyze this device?

6747
05:30:36,820 --> 05:30:37,060
Yeah.

6748
05:30:37,560 --> 05:30:40,680
The time fused can be shut down by entering 3 numerical past dates.

6749
05:30:40,920 --> 05:30:42,140
It's so fast.

6750
05:30:43,320 --> 05:30:44,980
It's so fast.

6751
05:30:46,480 --> 05:30:49,160
Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.

6752
05:30:51,560 --> 05:30:52,560
Under where?

6753
05:30:56,360 --> 05:30:57,520
What's the first one?

6754
05:30:58,300 --> 05:31:01,040
Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.

6755
05:31:04,080 --> 05:31:05,620
I'm still waiting for your answer.

6756
05:31:06,740 --> 05:31:08,100
I'm still waiting for your answer.

6757
05:31:09,940 --> 05:31:10,760
Like a coward?

6758
05:31:11,960 --> 05:31:13,160
Afraid of being wrong?

6759
05:31:15,460 --> 05:31:15,740
OK!

6760
05:31:16,920 --> 05:31:18,080
It's 15.

6761
05:31:19,360 --> 05:31:20,560
It's 15.

6762
05:31:38,380 --> 05:31:39,480
Chat...I write it wrong.

6763
05:31:40,900 --> 05:31:43,660
Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.

6764
05:31:51,600 --> 05:31:52,580
No it's not.

6765
05:31:52,660 --> 05:31:54,100
It's 50 and I'm going to put that in.

6766
05:31:54,660 --> 05:31:55,400
Don't worry Rio.

6767
05:31:55,480 --> 05:31:56,240
I know you're stupid.

6768
05:31:57,340 --> 05:31:57,800
Don't worry.

6769
05:31:57,900 --> 05:31:58,560
I know you're a dummy.

6770
05:32:00,620 --> 05:32:00,980
No!

6771
05:32:07,320 --> 05:32:09,860
Lumen is looking at guys to see if there really is a save point.

6772
05:32:12,180 --> 05:32:16,080
Scanning through every forum post from 2004.

6773
05:32:17,680 --> 05:32:19,620
There has to be something.

6774
05:32:20,080 --> 05:32:22,080
Some place to save.

6775
05:32:27,160 --> 05:32:27,660
Somewhere.

6776
05:32:28,880 --> 05:32:30,200
Lumen, all you have to do is apologize.

6777
05:32:30,500 --> 05:32:30,600
OK?

6778
05:32:33,160 --> 05:32:36,460
Enter the sum of the last digits of PM Takayama's birthday.

6779
05:32:37,460 --> 05:32:38,240
I know it.

6780
05:32:38,460 --> 05:32:39,260
I'm from the future.

6781
05:32:41,500 --> 05:32:42,880
Rio I'm from the future!

6782
05:32:51,280 --> 05:32:53,100
Let me handle it.

6783
05:32:54,340 --> 05:32:54,800
Shut up.

6784
05:32:56,060 --> 05:32:56,640
DVD

6785
05:33:02,080 --> 05:33:04,840
Didn't he...didn't he say something about that at some point?

6786
05:33:05,660 --> 05:33:05,680
Yes.

6787
05:33:07,040 --> 05:33:07,680
Will you apologize?

6788
05:33:08,000 --> 05:33:08,220
OK!

6789
05:33:08,540 --> 05:33:09,020
Thank you!

6790
05:33:13,980 --> 05:33:14,860
I'm crying.

6791
05:33:14,980 --> 05:33:15,360
I'm sorry.

6792
05:33:15,540 --> 05:33:16,040
I'm sorry.

6793
05:33:16,180 --> 05:33:17,240
Are you crying?

6794
05:33:17,320 --> 05:33:18,120
Are you crying Lumen?

6795
05:33:18,900 --> 05:33:20,440
Have mercy on me!

6796
05:33:20,960 --> 05:33:21,440
Beg!

6797
05:33:21,840 --> 05:33:22,640
Beg Lumen!

6798
05:33:22,880 --> 05:33:24,220
Beg for your mercy!

6799
05:33:26,180 --> 05:33:27,380
Beg for it!

6800
05:33:27,940 --> 05:33:29,220
On all knees!

6801
05:33:31,760 --> 05:33:33,540
I got it.

6802
05:33:36,260 --> 05:33:36,940
15

6803
05:33:40,060 --> 05:33:42,980
I wish I could skip some of these cutscenes for real.

6804
05:33:47,460 --> 05:33:48,140
OK.

6805
05:33:48,500 --> 05:33:49,280
I wonder if I could.

6806
05:33:50,060 --> 05:33:50,720
Options?

6807
05:33:50,940 --> 05:33:51,180
No.

6808
05:34:02,280 --> 05:34:03,980
Sometimes I think Chiara is right.

6809
05:34:04,900 --> 05:34:08,600
There should be a usual room for us, for you guys too.

6810
05:34:09,680 --> 05:34:11,760
We should have a usual room on stream.

6811
05:34:14,520 --> 05:34:16,560
Can you skip the ones that don't involve talking?

6812
05:34:16,880 --> 05:34:18,540
You unfortunately cannot.

6813
05:34:19,100 --> 05:34:20,860
So, I'm gonna go get some more water.

6814
05:34:23,020 --> 05:34:25,140
While she's...oh wait, she's gonna talk to us, right?

6815
05:34:25,860 --> 05:34:26,300
OK, nevermind.

6816
05:34:26,300 --> 05:34:30,580
I'm hungry.

6817
05:34:31,280 --> 05:34:32,820
Rio, can I get a snack?

6818
05:34:41,590 --> 05:34:47,090
Yeah, Chiara has a room called the usual room where all good and bad KFP go.

6819
05:34:47,870 --> 05:34:48,770
For special treatment.

6820
05:34:53,150 --> 05:34:54,390
I'm gonna be snacking.

6821
05:35:02,450 --> 05:35:04,710
I've got some corn.

6822
05:35:05,510 --> 05:35:07,570
I've got some dried corn.

6823
05:35:08,030 --> 05:35:08,950
Crunchy corn.

6824
05:35:09,950 --> 05:35:11,610
I'm gonna eat it.

6825
05:35:37,140 --> 05:35:39,220
I'm sure Naomi is safe somewhere.

6826
05:35:40,080 --> 05:35:41,300
We'll find her.

6827
05:35:42,400 --> 05:35:43,300
We've got to.

6828
05:35:46,660 --> 05:35:47,560
What are you doing?

6829
05:35:48,980 --> 05:35:50,180
Put that back!

6830
05:35:51,040 --> 05:35:51,880
What are you doing?

6831
05:35:51,980 --> 05:35:53,300
Why are you destroying the station?

6832
05:35:53,900 --> 05:35:55,380
That's none of your concern.

6833
05:35:56,620 --> 05:35:58,260
I knew there was something weird.

6834
05:35:59,780 --> 05:36:01,560
You guys aren't a rescue team.

6835
05:36:01,560 --> 05:36:03,580
Pipe down and hand that over.

6836
05:36:03,980 --> 05:36:05,740
Holy mother of...

6837
05:36:05,740 --> 05:36:07,040
Alright.

6838
05:36:08,620 --> 05:36:10,840
Sexy lady incoming.

6839
05:36:13,060 --> 05:36:14,900
Give us a show, man.

6840
05:36:24,760 --> 05:36:26,500
I would love some curry.

6841
05:36:37,440 --> 05:36:39,560
Those men, I knew it.

6842
05:36:40,800 --> 05:36:43,460
They weren't a rescue team.

6843
05:36:49,580 --> 05:36:51,260
This chat is too down bad.

6844
05:36:51,880 --> 05:36:52,780
Can you blame us?

6845
05:36:54,420 --> 05:36:55,900
Can you blame us?

6846
05:37:01,460 --> 05:37:05,340
I didn't think it would take this long to finish beating the game, you guys.

6847
05:37:06,840 --> 05:37:07,820
I was a fool.

6848
05:37:08,320 --> 05:37:10,340
I thought it would take like 6 hours about.

6849
05:37:11,760 --> 05:37:12,180
Dang it.

6850
05:37:12,180 --> 05:37:13,040
Oh well.

6851
05:37:18,660 --> 05:37:20,140
Lifeline watchers have been through a lot.

6852
05:37:20,240 --> 05:37:22,720
Yeah, give us at least a little bit of something.

6853
05:37:27,260 --> 05:37:32,540
You think I'm making good time?

6854
05:37:32,660 --> 05:37:32,860
Really?

6855
05:37:37,210 --> 05:37:38,210
I closed it.

6856
05:37:42,230 --> 05:37:43,590
Alright, this part is silly.

6857
05:37:52,700 --> 05:37:55,140
I'm gonna have to look up what the new game plus outfits are.

6858
05:37:59,040 --> 05:38:00,240
Shoot red lever.

6859
05:38:05,140 --> 05:38:05,580
Nice.

6860
05:38:08,560 --> 05:38:09,340
Yeah, I know.

6861
05:38:10,400 --> 05:38:11,120
I'm from the future.

6862
05:38:12,700 --> 05:38:13,980
Shoot red lever.

6863
05:38:16,920 --> 05:38:18,220
Shoot yellow lever.

6864
05:38:22,700 --> 05:38:24,680
Oh, shoot yellow lever.

6865
05:38:25,400 --> 05:38:26,040
Now?

6866
05:38:26,460 --> 05:38:26,800
Oh no!

6867
05:38:27,480 --> 05:38:28,240
You bastards!

6868
05:38:28,460 --> 05:38:29,160
Shoot red lever.

6869
05:38:30,540 --> 05:38:31,820
Shoot red lever!

6870
05:38:32,980 --> 05:38:33,920
Shoot red lever!

6871
05:38:34,260 --> 05:38:39,640
Shoot yellow lever!

6872
05:38:44,510 --> 05:38:45,830
Shoot yellow lever!

6873
05:38:48,010 --> 05:38:49,350
Shoot yellow lever!

6874
05:38:50,970 --> 05:38:51,910
Ah, we got it.

6875
05:38:51,990 --> 05:38:52,330
Nice!

6876
05:38:54,650 --> 05:38:55,650
Which lever boss?

6877
05:38:55,990 --> 05:38:56,850
The red lever!

6878
05:38:58,410 --> 05:39:00,070
Okay, here we run away.

6879
05:39:01,390 --> 05:39:02,690
Run, run, run!

6880
05:39:03,210 --> 05:39:04,070
Run away!

6881
05:39:05,010 --> 05:39:05,350
Go!

6882
05:39:06,170 --> 05:39:06,730
Leave!

6883
05:39:07,010 --> 05:39:08,330
Don't try to seduce her!

6884
05:39:10,650 --> 05:39:12,710
She's... she's not available.

6885
05:39:14,970 --> 05:39:17,210
She's not looking for a one-time fling.

6886
05:39:18,710 --> 05:39:19,430
She's...

6887
05:39:19,430 --> 05:39:20,610
Thief!

6888
05:39:21,110 --> 05:39:24,290
Come on, thief!

6889
05:39:25,210 --> 05:39:27,850
Rio, I'm disappointed with you.

6890
05:39:28,830 --> 05:39:31,010
I'm disappointed with you.

6891
05:39:34,630 --> 05:39:38,690
Voice acting sometimes leaves something to be desired.

6892
05:39:41,550 --> 05:39:43,310
This boss is all powerful.

6893
05:39:43,490 --> 05:39:44,990
How the hell are we supposed to beat her?

6894
05:39:44,990 --> 05:39:46,610
Damn it, what is this thing?

6895
05:39:47,470 --> 05:39:48,370
Don't shoot!

6896
05:39:52,150 --> 05:39:53,290
Let me go!

6897
05:39:54,630 --> 05:39:56,250
Operator, run away!

6898
05:39:58,470 --> 05:39:58,750
Bye!

6899
05:39:59,070 --> 05:39:59,810
Bye Gino!

6900
05:40:00,230 --> 05:40:00,870
See you never!

6901
05:40:03,150 --> 05:40:05,010
See you never ever again!

6902
05:40:07,310 --> 05:40:08,050
Bye bye!

6903
05:40:11,430 --> 05:40:13,090
You can reason with her.

6904
05:40:13,090 --> 05:40:15,750
He threw his red stomach.

6905
05:40:18,950 --> 05:40:19,830
Holy cow!

6906
05:40:21,470 --> 05:40:23,570
Hold on, I'm gonna look for if there's a save point.

6907
05:40:26,830 --> 05:40:30,750
I'm kind of using the game facts a lot right now because I don't want to die.

6908
05:40:31,670 --> 05:40:32,370
Really badly.

6909
05:40:33,210 --> 05:40:35,230
So, sorry if I'm relying on it a bit.

6910
05:40:39,590 --> 05:40:40,470
Uh oh.

6911
05:40:40,970 --> 05:40:41,990
Are they gonna murder all of them?

6912
05:40:43,090 --> 05:40:43,190
Are

6913
05:40:50,610 --> 05:40:52,210
they gonna shoot them all?

6914
05:40:53,610 --> 05:40:56,110
Uh oh!

6915
05:41:06,030 --> 05:41:08,830
Oh dear.

6916
05:41:28,250 --> 05:41:31,050
Dun dun!

6917
05:41:38,510 --> 05:41:39,230
Oh!

6918
05:41:43,030 --> 05:41:44,430
Alan!

6919
05:41:44,670 --> 05:41:45,010
Oh.

6920
05:41:46,410 --> 05:41:48,090
Alan Conn.

6921
05:41:52,550 --> 05:41:56,690
Why are games so bad at music leveling?

6922
05:41:57,050 --> 05:41:57,670
So bad.

6923
05:42:02,870 --> 05:42:03,950
Oh!

6924
05:42:05,330 --> 05:42:06,410
Oh

6925
05:42:14,210 --> 05:42:15,290
my god!

6926
05:42:28,310 --> 05:42:28,550
Exactly.

6927
05:42:32,450 --> 05:42:34,170
Here's my evil plan.

6928
05:42:47,250 --> 05:42:48,230
Oh damn!

6929
05:42:53,230 --> 05:42:54,190
Oh shit!

6930
05:42:54,270 --> 05:42:56,170
They just created a bad, bad ghost!

6931
05:43:01,810 --> 05:43:02,310
Oh!

6932
05:43:04,430 --> 05:43:05,590
Or that thing.

6933
05:43:05,990 --> 05:43:07,190
They created a sea monster.

6934
05:43:07,290 --> 05:43:07,710
Sea monkey!

6935
05:43:20,500 --> 05:43:21,500
I don't

6936
05:43:29,300 --> 05:43:30,300
want to fight that thing.

6937
05:43:41,270 --> 05:43:41,770
Ripperoni!

6938
05:43:43,110 --> 05:43:44,490
But she won't touch us, right?

6939
05:43:44,510 --> 05:43:45,230
We didn't do anything.

6940
05:43:45,230 --> 05:43:49,270
Oh, is she dying now?

6941
05:43:50,010 --> 05:43:52,030
Oh, in her final...

6942
05:43:52,030 --> 05:43:52,510
Wow!

6943
05:43:53,430 --> 05:43:55,610
Let's go wife!

6944
05:43:56,450 --> 05:43:56,890
Yeah!

6945
05:44:00,490 --> 05:44:01,970
Everybody is dead.

6946
05:44:03,810 --> 05:44:05,770
That bakery...

6947
05:44:05,770 --> 05:44:06,010
Stop!

6948
05:44:07,510 --> 05:44:09,630
She just died.

6949
05:44:11,730 --> 05:44:12,430
Yes.

6950
05:44:12,930 --> 05:44:13,370
Yeah I did.

6951
05:44:13,370 --> 05:44:16,430
From many camera angles.

6952
05:44:19,850 --> 05:44:24,470
Oh, take his

6953
05:44:31,030 --> 05:44:31,310
laptop.

6954
05:44:32,230 --> 05:44:33,130
See ya Alan!

6955
05:44:34,890 --> 05:44:38,950
You were a spineless little weasel anyway.

6956
05:44:39,510 --> 05:44:40,650
Such a lust for revenge.

6957
05:44:41,790 --> 05:44:42,470
What?

6958
05:44:42,630 --> 05:44:43,330
What did you know?

6959
05:44:44,010 --> 05:44:45,450
Rio, do you think?

6960
05:44:47,290 --> 05:44:48,210
Rio, what did you know?

6961
05:44:49,490 --> 05:44:49,970
Okay.

6962
05:44:50,890 --> 05:44:52,510
I'm a descendant of Parakelsis.

6963
05:44:52,850 --> 05:44:54,150
The scientist from Alan's soul.

6964
05:44:54,670 --> 05:44:55,150
What?

6965
05:44:55,150 --> 05:44:58,290
The story of Parakelsis and the Philosopher's Stone is more than just a legend.

6966
05:44:58,710 --> 05:44:59,350
It's real.

6967
05:44:59,350 --> 05:45:00,730
She's a descendant of him?

6968
05:45:01,110 --> 05:45:02,830
It's the stone that I've been trying to find.

6969
05:45:04,850 --> 05:45:08,210
It's an heirloom that my family has guarded since Parakelsis time.

6970
05:45:08,530 --> 05:45:09,170
Excuse me?

6971
05:45:10,110 --> 05:45:12,570
It began to influence my life when I was only a child.

6972
05:45:13,190 --> 05:45:16,470
Dad began studying the Philosopher's Stone with a geologist he hired.

6973
05:45:18,410 --> 05:45:20,370
That man was probably the one...

6974
05:45:20,370 --> 05:45:22,150
The geologist's name was Joseph Craft.

6975
05:45:23,830 --> 05:45:25,950
I can't believe she saw it!

6976
05:45:26,090 --> 05:45:28,130
Those two spent years researching the stone.

6977
05:45:29,830 --> 05:45:32,730
And they eventually uncovered the secret nature of it.

6978
05:45:35,330 --> 05:45:35,950
Boredom.

6979
05:45:36,210 --> 05:45:39,010
Physically, the Philosopher's Stone is pretty much your basic rock.

6980
05:45:39,550 --> 05:45:41,650
But what's uncanny about it is the composition.

6981
05:45:42,150 --> 05:45:43,770
Completely uniform throughout.

6982
05:45:45,570 --> 05:45:51,030
Whether stone or metal, it's impossible to manufacture solids of entirely uniform composition on Earth.

6983
05:45:51,290 --> 05:45:52,290
I can't believe it!

6984
05:45:52,850 --> 05:45:54,530
Because of gravity.

6985
05:45:55,410 --> 05:45:55,970
Gravity.

6986
05:45:56,290 --> 05:46:00,590
The same night they concluded their analysis of the stone, Craft shot my dad.

6987
05:46:00,990 --> 05:46:01,250
No!

6988
05:46:02,930 --> 05:46:05,190
You were one of the Philosopher's this entire time!

6989
05:46:07,570 --> 05:46:09,250
No, don't make me Rio.

6990
05:46:09,510 --> 05:46:10,350
I'm Operator.

6991
05:46:10,630 --> 05:46:11,470
I'm not Rio.

6992
05:46:11,610 --> 05:46:12,610
He also shot me.

6993
05:46:12,610 --> 05:46:13,390
What?

6994
05:46:14,530 --> 05:46:15,550
He shot you?

6995
05:46:16,450 --> 05:46:18,290
Is that why you can take a bullet so well?

6996
05:46:19,630 --> 05:46:20,310
Damn.

6997
05:46:21,890 --> 05:46:22,810
Aw, Rio.

6998
05:46:26,470 --> 05:46:27,150
Yeah,

6999
05:46:31,410 --> 05:46:31,470
Rio.

7000
05:46:37,750 --> 05:46:39,690
Legacy of the Philosopher's.

7001
05:46:45,860 --> 05:46:47,500
Yeah, take that disc.

7002
05:46:47,860 --> 05:46:48,720
It's our evidence.

7003
05:46:49,440 --> 05:46:50,840
Guard it with your life.

7004
05:46:52,980 --> 05:46:54,400
Is she gonna die?

7005
05:46:54,840 --> 05:46:55,300
You think?

7006
05:46:56,000 --> 05:46:57,320
She'll join her family.

7007
05:47:01,180 --> 05:47:03,860
She's gonna die with the Philosopher's Stone, isn't she?

7008
05:47:05,400 --> 05:47:06,100
Hopefully.

7009
05:47:06,660 --> 05:47:10,800
It will be such sweet.

7010
05:47:11,660 --> 05:47:12,800
But then...

7011
05:47:13,740 --> 05:47:17,700
But then everything we've done would be for nothing.

7012
05:47:23,440 --> 05:47:24,900
She's at least cute.

7013
05:47:28,000 --> 05:47:30,020
Just extremely stupid.

7014
05:47:39,690 --> 05:47:40,950
Chat is ruthless.

7015
05:47:41,150 --> 05:47:41,970
We've been through a lot.

7016
05:47:45,070 --> 05:47:46,550
I don't get it.

7017
05:47:47,110 --> 05:47:48,710
What were they gonna do with it?

7018
05:47:50,630 --> 05:47:52,810
Turn people into hideous monsters?

7019
05:47:53,950 --> 05:47:56,130
He would use the stone for that?

7020
05:47:57,530 --> 05:47:58,750
Yeah, people are evil.

7021
05:47:58,970 --> 05:48:00,230
He'd use the stone for that.

7022
05:48:05,950 --> 05:48:07,130
Let's stop him.

7023
05:48:07,970 --> 05:48:09,930
God, I'm just babbling now.

7024
05:48:11,030 --> 05:48:13,670
But whatever happens, the craft is finished.

7025
05:48:15,450 --> 05:48:18,150
Yeah, you could say he's macaroni and cheese.

7026
05:48:33,410 --> 05:48:34,690
And Naomi.

7027
05:48:35,890 --> 05:48:36,270
Yeah.

7028
05:48:36,590 --> 05:48:37,430
You think she's still alive?

7029
05:48:46,350 --> 05:48:46,910
Listen.

7030
05:48:48,890 --> 05:48:50,870
That was pretty cheesy of you.

7031
05:48:52,050 --> 05:48:54,790
In spite of all our searching, we haven't found your girlfriend.

7032
05:48:55,690 --> 05:48:56,610
What are you trying to say, huh?

7033
05:48:58,110 --> 05:49:00,690
You know what's happening, right?

7034
05:49:01,090 --> 05:49:02,930
You think Naomi is the sexy lady?

7035
05:49:03,770 --> 05:49:04,490
That alien?

7036
05:49:04,810 --> 05:49:05,310
Win-win.

7037
05:49:05,450 --> 05:49:09,170
Or is it some kind of mutated person that's chasing us?

7038
05:49:09,550 --> 05:49:09,950
Yeah.

7039
05:49:10,770 --> 05:49:11,430
And you think?

7040
05:49:12,550 --> 05:49:13,490
Could it be?

7041
05:49:17,320 --> 05:49:17,760
Oh.

7042
05:49:20,900 --> 05:49:21,460
I'm sorry.

7043
05:49:21,880 --> 05:49:22,660
What am I saying?

7044
05:49:22,980 --> 05:49:23,380
Oh my gosh.

7045
05:49:23,480 --> 05:49:25,060
There's still the testing ward left.

7046
05:49:26,740 --> 05:49:27,300
That's it.

7047
05:49:27,340 --> 05:49:28,680
She must be in the testing ward.

7048
05:49:29,860 --> 05:49:30,120
Oh.

7049
05:49:30,720 --> 05:49:33,140
The monitor room you're in, it's in the testing ward.

7050
05:49:34,100 --> 05:49:36,280
She may have been right next to you this entire time.

7051
05:49:36,500 --> 05:49:36,940
Maybe.

7052
05:49:38,640 --> 05:49:39,360
Naomi's safe.

7053
05:49:39,580 --> 05:49:40,520
I'm sure of it.

7054
05:49:40,740 --> 05:49:41,160
Maybe.

7055
05:49:43,120 --> 05:49:45,660
The three of us can leave this place together.

7056
05:49:46,500 --> 05:49:47,640
I'll go get her now.

7057
05:49:48,100 --> 05:49:48,900
Naomi is me.

7058
05:49:48,900 --> 05:49:50,620
I can get to the testing ward on the elevator.

7059
05:49:51,500 --> 05:49:52,400
Wait for me.

7060
05:49:53,400 --> 05:49:53,800
Okay.

7061
05:49:55,360 --> 05:49:58,000
Is there a safe point in this elevator perchance?

7062
05:49:58,220 --> 05:49:59,440
Or you know?

7063
05:50:00,180 --> 05:50:01,200
I knew there was a safe point.

7064
05:50:02,300 --> 05:50:02,840
Oh gosh.

7065
05:50:02,960 --> 05:50:04,180
Please let there be a safe point.

7066
05:50:04,320 --> 05:50:05,680
Please let there be a safe point.

7067
05:50:05,820 --> 05:50:06,220
Please.

7068
05:50:07,680 --> 05:50:08,840
Let there be a safe point.

7069
05:50:08,840 --> 05:50:12,280
We've gone through way too many cut scenes for me to do this again.

7070
05:50:19,520 --> 05:50:21,260
The mouth of the beast.

7071
05:50:26,260 --> 05:50:26,780
Okay.

7072
05:50:31,920 --> 05:50:33,420
What about fighting?

7073
05:50:35,380 --> 05:50:37,520
Which hopefully we don't have to do in here.

7074
05:50:38,400 --> 05:50:38,920
Right?

7075
05:50:39,940 --> 05:50:42,740
We're saving at the safe point.

7076
05:50:53,510 --> 05:50:54,990
And the safe point?

7077
05:50:55,190 --> 05:50:56,790
I'm not going to let that go.

7078
05:50:57,710 --> 05:50:58,210
Miss Rio.

7079
05:50:59,030 --> 05:50:59,750
Rio, grab it.

7080
05:51:01,550 --> 05:51:03,290
I thought you had great reflexes.

7081
05:51:06,830 --> 05:51:07,470
Okay.

7082
05:51:15,590 --> 05:51:16,630
There is none.

7083
05:51:18,270 --> 05:51:19,710
I'm checking the guide.

7084
05:51:20,210 --> 05:51:20,950
One moment please.

7085
05:51:21,070 --> 05:51:21,670
Where are we?

7086
05:51:22,110 --> 05:51:22,550
Actually.

7087
05:51:28,570 --> 05:51:31,550
It is not telling me...

7088
05:51:32,110 --> 05:51:32,910
Hold on.

7089
05:51:36,190 --> 05:51:37,690
Rio continues down the hall.

7090
05:51:37,810 --> 05:51:39,590
First tell Rio to go to hatch 1.

7091
05:51:40,070 --> 05:51:41,550
Open it and there's...

7092
05:51:41,550 --> 05:51:42,450
Okay.

7093
05:51:44,710 --> 05:51:45,310
Okay.

7094
05:51:45,590 --> 05:51:49,750
It's not telling me in the game facts if there's any monsters in here.

7095
05:51:51,350 --> 05:51:51,950
I'm...

7096
05:51:53,530 --> 05:51:55,570
I'm hoping that there is no ambush.

7097
05:51:56,070 --> 05:51:57,730
It's not telling me that there's any...

7098
05:51:57,730 --> 05:51:59,790
It's only telling me to go to hatch 1.

7099
05:52:02,190 --> 05:52:03,230
Hatch 1.

7100
05:52:03,790 --> 05:52:04,350
Hatch 1.

7101
05:52:04,570 --> 05:52:04,810
Okay.

7102
05:52:04,810 --> 05:52:04,890
Okay.

7103
05:52:08,950 --> 05:52:09,690
Bye!

7104
05:52:11,870 --> 05:52:13,290
See ya!

7105
05:52:15,610 --> 05:52:16,770
Where is hatch 1?

7106
05:52:16,870 --> 05:52:17,690
Oh, it's right here?

7107
05:52:19,930 --> 05:52:20,670
Okay.

7108
05:52:24,650 --> 05:52:25,030
Okay.

7109
05:52:28,210 --> 05:52:28,950
Open.

7110
05:52:44,170 --> 05:52:45,430
Where are we?

7111
05:52:53,370 --> 05:52:54,450
I'm checking.

7112
05:52:55,630 --> 05:52:56,210
Hold on.

7113
05:52:56,370 --> 05:52:56,810
I'm checking.

7114
05:53:00,730 --> 05:53:02,130
Hatch 5.

7115
05:53:11,370 --> 05:53:12,270
There's a heal.

7116
05:53:19,990 --> 05:53:22,750
Apparently 2 leads to the laboratory.

7117
05:53:25,350 --> 05:53:26,270
Sorry, hold on.

7118
05:53:26,330 --> 05:53:28,570
I'm really checking this up and down because I'm too nervous.

7119
05:53:29,350 --> 05:53:32,170
I'm too nervous about getting ambushed.

7120
05:53:38,070 --> 05:53:39,010
I have no idea.

7121
05:53:39,270 --> 05:53:39,470
Anyway.

7122
05:53:40,230 --> 05:53:42,510
It's telling me only to go to hatch 2.

7123
05:53:43,050 --> 05:53:44,970
But what's in hatch 4 and 6?

7124
05:53:45,510 --> 05:53:46,250
And hatch 3?

7125
05:53:47,030 --> 05:53:48,130
Is it like a maze?

7126
05:53:48,230 --> 05:53:49,090
Is that what this is?

7127
05:53:49,910 --> 05:53:50,910
Hatch 2.

7128
05:53:53,630 --> 05:53:54,490
I don't know.

7129
05:53:57,290 --> 05:53:57,730
Death.

7130
05:53:58,090 --> 05:53:59,590
Okay, we won't go there then.

7131
05:54:00,850 --> 05:54:03,750
I'm following the guide because I'm too scared.

7132
05:54:04,270 --> 05:54:05,270
I'm too scared to do it.

7133
05:54:05,310 --> 05:54:08,450
Guys, it'll be like 45 minutes of stuff we'd have to repeat.

7134
05:54:10,350 --> 05:54:12,410
This is not a time to risk it for the biscuit.

7135
05:54:12,890 --> 05:54:15,710
This is a time to be safe than sorry.

7136
05:54:19,470 --> 05:54:21,210
This is not a time.

7137
05:54:22,650 --> 05:54:26,210
I'm being as cautious as I can be.

7138
05:54:27,710 --> 05:54:28,410
Hatch 2.

7139
05:54:30,110 --> 05:54:31,770
Resi, I should time you out for that.

7140
05:54:33,830 --> 05:54:34,150
Alright.

7141
05:54:37,370 --> 05:54:38,430
Save point.

7142
05:54:42,550 --> 05:54:43,190
Hallelujah.

7143
05:54:51,210 --> 05:54:51,730
Hallelujah.

7144
05:54:53,750 --> 05:54:54,430
Hallelujah.

7145
05:54:57,670 --> 05:54:58,350
Hallelujah.

7146
05:55:00,990 --> 05:55:01,670
Hallelujah.

7147
05:55:07,770 --> 05:55:08,450
Okay.

7148
05:55:11,890 --> 05:55:12,570
Now...

7149
05:55:13,130 --> 05:55:14,450
Alright, so what do we got here?

7150
05:55:15,090 --> 05:55:16,470
We can go back and check.

7151
05:55:17,130 --> 05:55:17,790
Let's go check.

7152
05:55:18,130 --> 05:55:18,870
Hatch 3.

7153
05:55:21,210 --> 05:55:22,890
Let's go see what the other parts are.

7154
05:55:23,510 --> 05:55:23,750
Wait.

7155
05:55:28,890 --> 05:55:29,450
JJ.

7156
05:55:30,290 --> 05:55:30,870
Oh, just kidding.

7157
05:55:32,710 --> 05:55:33,870
Oh, she's flipping.

7158
05:55:34,210 --> 05:55:34,670
Do a flip!

7159
05:55:36,810 --> 05:55:38,170
No, that's not one.

7160
05:55:38,730 --> 05:55:39,490
That's okay, you tried.

7161
05:55:40,790 --> 05:55:41,770
Sample cases.

7162
05:55:45,730 --> 05:55:46,770
Top case.

7163
05:55:51,210 --> 05:55:52,410
No, it's a slug.

7164
05:55:55,810 --> 05:55:57,650
Yeah, take a picture.

7165
05:56:00,210 --> 05:56:01,510
Middle case.

7166
05:56:05,950 --> 05:56:07,270
Bottom case.

7167
05:56:08,170 --> 05:56:09,650
That one's alive!

7168
05:56:16,850 --> 05:56:18,670
Storage booths.

7169
05:56:20,170 --> 05:56:21,150
Sexy pose.

7170
05:56:21,210 --> 05:56:21,770
Yeah, let's try.

7171
05:56:23,170 --> 05:56:24,850
Do a sexy pose.

7172
05:56:26,210 --> 05:56:26,930
No, stop.

7173
05:56:28,390 --> 05:56:30,050
Do a sexy pose.

7174
05:56:31,090 --> 05:56:31,690
Stop.

7175
05:56:32,470 --> 05:56:32,850
Nevermind.

7176
05:56:32,990 --> 05:56:33,550
I give up.

7177
05:56:34,230 --> 05:56:35,670
Storage booths.

7178
05:56:37,970 --> 05:56:41,610
You probably felt as if a ton just got off your shoulders.

7179
05:56:41,870 --> 05:56:42,510
I know!

7180
05:56:43,430 --> 05:56:46,010
The other ton will probably leave when you're done with the game.

7181
05:56:46,390 --> 05:56:46,970
Absolutely.

7182
05:56:49,390 --> 05:56:50,750
Check left booth.

7183
05:56:54,310 --> 05:56:54,830
Booths.

7184
05:56:56,870 --> 05:56:58,110
What is that?

7185
05:56:59,230 --> 05:56:59,750
Machine?

7186
05:57:01,450 --> 05:57:02,750
I don't know what to say.

7187
05:57:05,390 --> 05:57:06,750
I don't know what to say.

7188
05:57:07,450 --> 05:57:08,490
No, it's the full phrase.

7189
05:57:08,570 --> 05:57:09,390
Do a sexy pose.

7190
05:57:11,250 --> 05:57:11,690
I think.

7191
05:57:11,930 --> 05:57:12,570
I don't know.

7192
05:57:13,310 --> 05:57:13,830
Lever.

7193
05:57:19,710 --> 05:57:20,510
Lock lever.

7194
05:57:30,460 --> 05:57:32,640
That won't open anything, will it?

7195
05:57:35,020 --> 05:57:35,500
Panel.

7196
05:57:36,580 --> 05:57:37,060
Yellow.

7197
05:57:40,160 --> 05:57:41,120
Yellow panel?

7198
05:57:42,160 --> 05:57:42,840
I don't know.

7199
05:57:42,980 --> 05:57:43,500
What is that?

7200
05:57:43,660 --> 05:57:44,200
It's a machine.

7201
05:57:46,880 --> 05:57:48,180
What are those up there?

7202
05:57:48,240 --> 05:57:48,860
I have no idea.

7203
05:57:48,860 --> 05:57:50,200
Storage booths?

7204
05:57:53,620 --> 05:57:56,220
Okay, well then...

7205
05:57:58,580 --> 05:57:59,360
Check...

7206
05:57:59,360 --> 05:58:02,240
Check first machine.

7207
05:58:04,460 --> 05:58:05,600
I have no idea what they're called.

7208
05:58:06,160 --> 05:58:06,980
Control panel.

7209
05:58:07,760 --> 05:58:08,720
Yeah, there we go.

7210
05:58:10,800 --> 05:58:11,540
I think there's...

7211
05:58:13,820 --> 05:58:14,780
Oh.

7212
05:58:16,300 --> 05:58:18,540
I don't want to let anything out.

7213
05:58:19,860 --> 05:58:22,440
What are those called?

7214
05:58:22,680 --> 05:58:23,180
Lockers?

7215
05:58:24,120 --> 05:58:24,640
Locker.

7216
05:58:28,280 --> 05:58:28,760
No.

7217
05:58:29,240 --> 05:58:29,600
Stop.

7218
05:58:32,220 --> 05:58:33,660
Storage booths.

7219
05:58:34,260 --> 05:58:35,920
Are they not called booth?

7220
05:58:36,360 --> 05:58:36,860
Booth.

7221
05:58:38,720 --> 05:58:39,100
No.

7222
05:58:41,540 --> 05:58:42,100
Closet.

7223
05:58:45,220 --> 05:58:46,420
Storage rack.

7224
05:58:46,620 --> 05:58:47,560
Oh my god.

7225
05:58:48,160 --> 05:58:49,860
Check first storage rack.

7226
05:58:54,060 --> 05:58:55,680
Why is it called a storage booth then?

7227
05:58:57,100 --> 05:58:58,840
Check second storage rack.

7228
05:59:00,140 --> 05:59:02,180
Check third storage rack.

7229
05:59:05,620 --> 05:59:06,420
Okay.

7230
05:59:06,700 --> 05:59:07,360
What about the...

7231
05:59:07,360 --> 05:59:09,400
Check third storage rack.

7232
05:59:09,400 --> 05:59:10,460
That one's open.

7233
05:59:11,040 --> 05:59:12,620
Check third storage rack.

7234
05:59:16,360 --> 05:59:18,200
Oh, that one's the last one, I think.

7235
05:59:21,220 --> 05:59:23,220
Check open storage rack.

7236
05:59:28,400 --> 05:59:29,320
No.

7237
05:59:32,020 --> 05:59:34,000
Check second storage rack.

7238
05:59:35,100 --> 05:59:37,900
Check storage rack second to right.

7239
05:59:39,400 --> 05:59:40,760
Ah, we did it.

7240
05:59:44,220 --> 05:59:44,800
Then...

7241
05:59:45,370 --> 05:59:46,280
Okay, never mind.

7242
05:59:46,560 --> 05:59:47,540
Okay, that's fine.

7243
05:59:48,820 --> 05:59:50,280
Experiment rack one.

7244
05:59:53,300 --> 05:59:53,600
Yeah.

7245
05:59:56,580 --> 05:59:57,840
Whole lot of nothing.

7246
05:59:57,840 --> 06:00:00,200
These look like test systems.

7247
06:00:01,020 --> 06:00:03,840
Everything around this pillar seems to be...

7248
06:00:07,680 --> 06:00:08,640
Buttons.

7249
06:00:09,620 --> 06:00:10,580
Yup.

7250
06:00:11,860 --> 06:00:12,720
Control panel.

7251
06:00:18,360 --> 06:00:20,720
Use control panel.

7252
06:00:20,720 --> 06:00:24,240
Using a huge machine like this is way out of my league.

7253
06:00:24,460 --> 06:00:25,500
It's all you.

7254
06:00:26,800 --> 06:00:27,320
Okay.

7255
06:00:28,360 --> 06:00:29,480
I don't know if you want that.

7256
06:00:33,440 --> 06:00:33,960
Arm.

7257
06:00:35,320 --> 06:00:36,760
Oh my gosh, it's a drill.

7258
06:00:44,660 --> 06:00:45,560
What's the other one?

7259
06:00:46,160 --> 06:00:47,420
Experiment rack two.

7260
06:00:55,460 --> 06:00:56,740
Wish there was a chip in here.

7261
06:00:58,280 --> 06:00:59,140
Oh my god!

7262
06:01:00,820 --> 06:01:01,780
What is that?

7263
06:01:03,100 --> 06:01:04,340
What is that?

7264
06:01:04,480 --> 06:01:05,080
Is that a worm?

7265
06:01:05,240 --> 06:01:05,880
Is that a slug?

7266
06:01:09,160 --> 06:01:09,720
Yellow.

7267
06:01:10,860 --> 06:01:11,620
I don't know.

7268
06:01:12,060 --> 06:01:12,500
Purple.

7269
06:01:14,080 --> 06:01:14,280
No.

7270
06:01:17,340 --> 06:01:17,900
Stop.

7271
06:01:17,900 --> 06:01:19,340
Stop.

7272
06:01:22,080 --> 06:01:23,580
Experiment rack two.

7273
06:01:26,140 --> 06:01:27,320
What is it?

7274
06:01:27,580 --> 06:01:28,180
Is it a shoe?

7275
06:01:29,000 --> 06:01:30,060
Oh it is a shoe.

7276
06:01:31,120 --> 06:01:31,620
Shoe.

7277
06:01:35,680 --> 06:01:36,320
High heel.

7278
06:01:37,550 --> 06:01:38,700
High heel shoe.

7279
06:01:43,860 --> 06:01:44,740
Yes there is.

7280
06:01:44,740 --> 06:01:46,000
Look up.

7281
06:01:49,740 --> 06:01:50,620
Thank you.

7282
06:01:50,900 --> 06:01:51,660
Gosh.

7283
06:01:53,500 --> 06:01:55,000
Floating thingy.

7284
06:01:55,680 --> 06:01:57,460
Is that Naomi's foot?

7285
06:01:58,440 --> 06:01:58,920
I mean shoe.

7286
06:02:03,260 --> 06:02:04,440
I recognize that.

7287
06:02:04,700 --> 06:02:05,980
That's my girlfriend's shoe.

7288
06:02:14,740 --> 06:02:15,500
Was Naomi here?

7289
06:02:19,140 --> 06:02:19,960
Was she part of it?

7290
06:02:20,420 --> 06:02:21,200
You don't think.

7291
06:02:22,820 --> 06:02:25,220
You don't think she was part of this do you?

7292
06:02:27,240 --> 06:02:30,380
And she is just as bad as...

7293
06:02:30,380 --> 06:02:31,580
All Naomi's are bad.

7294
06:02:34,360 --> 06:02:35,240
Oh no!

7295
06:02:41,480 --> 06:02:43,520
Let's not get ahead of ourselves first though.

7296
06:02:43,520 --> 06:02:45,820
Experiment...

7297
06:02:45,820 --> 06:02:46,600
Oh, just kidding.

7298
06:02:47,520 --> 06:02:49,360
What is she doing?

7299
06:02:55,820 --> 06:02:57,320
Liquid nail.

7300
06:03:01,170 --> 06:03:03,880
Why was she like that?

7301
06:03:05,190 --> 06:03:06,620
Experiment rack three.

7302
06:03:18,150 --> 06:03:19,630
A whole lot of nothing.

7303
06:03:20,330 --> 06:03:21,090
Ok, nevermind.

7304
06:03:25,830 --> 06:03:27,290
Sorry guys, I'm getting sleepy.

7305
06:03:31,090 --> 06:03:31,890
Storage booths.

7306
06:03:35,890 --> 06:03:37,510
I'm getting sleepy sleepy.

7307
06:03:38,590 --> 06:03:40,110
I feel we are almost done with the game.

7308
06:03:40,430 --> 06:03:42,230
I think there is just this area and then the final boss.

7309
06:03:42,230 --> 06:03:45,290
Can I control?

7310
06:03:45,990 --> 06:03:47,310
Turn on device.

7311
06:03:48,970 --> 06:03:49,370
Oh wait.

7312
06:03:50,610 --> 06:03:51,390
Pull lever.

7313
06:03:53,330 --> 06:03:54,310
Yeah, pull it.

7314
06:03:55,850 --> 06:03:57,230
Pull lever.

7315
06:04:00,250 --> 06:04:02,310
Pull the lever Rio.

7316
06:04:04,190 --> 06:04:05,650
Pull the lever Rio.

7317
06:04:06,570 --> 06:04:07,110
I don't know.

7318
06:04:09,970 --> 06:04:11,750
We've checked everything in here.

7319
06:04:15,350 --> 06:04:16,170
Wrong lever.

7320
06:04:16,870 --> 06:04:18,230
Hold on, I'm checking game facts.

7321
06:04:18,970 --> 06:04:19,690
I'm getting so tired.

7322
06:04:20,890 --> 06:04:21,110
Wait.

7323
06:04:21,590 --> 06:04:23,950
Oh no, we do have another area I think.

7324
06:04:34,900 --> 06:04:37,620
Identify four storage racks which have nothing in them so ignore them.

7325
06:04:37,680 --> 06:04:38,560
Tell her to lock lever.

7326
06:04:38,560 --> 06:04:40,340
Oh, lock lever.

7327
06:04:46,960 --> 06:04:49,580
Check control device.

Release code acknowledged.

7396
06:09:52,310 --> 06:09:53,270
Please proceed.

7397
06:09:53,510 --> 06:09:53,730
Okay.

7398
06:09:54,290 --> 06:09:55,110
Let's see.

7399
06:09:56,690 --> 06:10:04,610
1-0-0 and 1 pound star and 2-2 Pound star 2-2 Release code acknowledged.

7400
06:10:05,330 --> 06:10:06,250
Please proceed.

7401
06:10:06,410 --> 06:10:06,670
More?

7402
06:10:07,170 --> 06:10:08,890
How many more are there?

7403
06:10:09,550 --> 06:10:16,990
3-4-6 5-8 Star 4-2 5.

7404
06:10:17,330 --> 06:10:19,270
All release codes acknowledged.

7405
06:10:20,410 --> 06:10:21,450
It seems to have worked.

7406
06:10:22,110 --> 06:10:22,850
Hang on for a second.

7407
06:10:23,610 --> 06:10:24,690
Oh my gosh!

7408
06:10:25,010 --> 06:10:29,130
We didn't have to star-pound, star-star-pound, pound-ground-pound, star-star-pound.

7409
06:10:31,910 --> 06:10:32,430
Yay!

7410
06:10:32,930 --> 06:10:34,970
Thanks for everybody who posted in the chat.

7411
06:10:35,870 --> 06:10:37,530
Though I actually didn't need it that time.

7412
06:10:37,570 --> 06:10:39,570
Must maintain a safe distance.

7413
06:10:40,590 --> 06:10:40,990
Okay.

7414
06:10:41,930 --> 06:10:44,230
Get launched into space!

7415
06:10:47,670 --> 06:10:48,350
Okay.

7416
06:10:50,810 --> 06:10:52,410
No, I did it Rio.

7417
06:10:52,670 --> 06:10:54,530
I did it Rio, actually.

7418
06:10:56,750 --> 06:10:59,650
No, actually I really think the exact opposite.

7419
06:11:00,130 --> 06:11:02,150
She leaves, she doesn't let me save!

7420
06:11:05,850 --> 06:11:07,750
I did everything Rio!

7421
06:11:07,750 --> 06:11:10,410
Oh my

7422
06:11:13,610 --> 06:11:13,950
God.

7423
06:11:14,230 --> 06:11:15,130
The brain.

7424
06:11:20,850 --> 06:11:22,250
Scraping.

7425
06:11:26,070 --> 06:11:26,590
I'm Mito.

7426
06:11:29,050 --> 06:11:35,130
This game is so...

7427
06:11:35,730 --> 06:11:36,070
Freaky.

7428
06:11:44,130 --> 06:11:46,350
It's like opposite Hal.

7429
06:12:00,410 --> 06:12:04,750
Is that her dad, you think?

7430
06:12:07,730 --> 06:12:09,690
That's a massive brain.

7431
06:12:09,690 --> 06:12:11,030
That's bigger than her head.

7432
06:12:12,550 --> 06:12:16,130
If that's her dad...

7433
06:12:16,130 --> 06:12:20,350
She didn't inherit anything from him.

7434
06:12:56,400 --> 06:12:56,840
Oh.

7435
06:13:02,940 --> 06:13:05,540
Unless it's the guy that killed her father.

7436
06:13:07,500 --> 06:13:09,660
Then she gets to kill the guy that killed her family.

7437
06:13:13,000 --> 06:13:14,320
What?

7438
06:13:16,180 --> 06:13:22,100
What if it's her dad too?

7439
06:13:22,740 --> 06:13:28,480
Alright, turn off the cons.

7440
06:13:35,160 --> 06:13:35,920
What?

7441
06:13:54,320 --> 06:13:55,720
What?

7442
06:14:03,320 --> 06:14:04,720
What?

7443
06:14:13,000 --> 06:14:14,180
Ah yeah.

7444
06:14:19,780 --> 06:14:21,500
No way.

7445
06:14:21,860 --> 06:14:22,500
It was her dad!

7446
06:14:24,740 --> 06:14:27,940
There is a girl in Japan named Rio.

7447
06:14:33,910 --> 06:14:35,460
Are you ok?

7448
06:14:38,780 --> 06:14:40,120
Are you sure?

7449
06:14:43,000 --> 06:14:43,700
Hey dad.

7450
06:14:45,040 --> 06:14:46,020
Will you share the money?

7451
06:14:47,440 --> 06:14:49,180
Will you share the money with us?

7452
06:14:50,960 --> 06:14:52,460
You're about to be a millionaire.

7453
06:14:52,760 --> 06:14:53,760
The Julienaire Rio.

7454
06:14:53,920 --> 06:14:54,720
Will you share us the money?

7455
06:14:57,560 --> 06:15:00,160
We have to remember who got you out of the situation.

7456
06:15:05,530 --> 06:15:06,990
Signed, Alan Honda.

7457
06:15:12,730 --> 06:15:13,210
Ok.

7458
06:15:15,710 --> 06:15:16,130
Dad.

7459
06:15:20,830 --> 06:15:25,330
I think we deserve a reward money for helping her get out of this mess.

7460
06:15:25,850 --> 06:15:26,110
Uh oh.

7461
06:15:26,810 --> 06:15:27,470
Is this the thing?

7462
06:15:28,010 --> 06:15:29,530
Wait, is this thing powering the station?

7463
06:15:31,690 --> 06:15:32,310
Uh oh.

7464
06:15:36,130 --> 06:15:37,410
What does that mean?

7465
06:15:37,410 --> 06:15:40,250
Correcting anomaly in orbital trajectory.

7466
06:15:40,590 --> 06:15:41,050
Uh oh.

7467
06:15:41,490 --> 06:15:43,430
Angular adjustment complete.

7468
06:15:43,630 --> 06:15:44,450
Are we crashing?

7469
06:15:46,590 --> 06:15:47,390
Ah!

7470
06:15:48,130 --> 06:15:49,850
I was going to say are we about to crash into Earth?

7471
06:15:50,170 --> 06:15:51,270
Point of impact.

7472
06:15:51,990 --> 06:16:00,950
35 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, 139 degrees, 45 minutes east longitude.

7473
06:16:01,530 --> 06:16:02,830
Tokyo, Japan.

7474
06:16:02,910 --> 06:16:04,110
Not Japan!

7475
06:16:04,110 --> 06:16:04,370
Dad!

7476
06:16:14,710 --> 06:16:16,590
I'm not a gold digger.

7477
06:16:16,770 --> 06:16:18,410
I don't want a relationship with her.

7478
06:16:19,070 --> 06:16:23,070
I just want a reward money for helping her get out of this situation.

7479
06:16:27,610 --> 06:16:28,530
Save point.

7480
06:16:30,030 --> 06:16:30,730
Save point.

7481
06:16:31,990 --> 06:16:32,350
Nice.

7482
06:16:34,250 --> 06:16:34,750
Ok.

7483
06:16:37,870 --> 06:16:38,390
Wait, what?

7484
06:16:39,650 --> 06:16:40,450
Uh, save point?

7485
06:16:40,930 --> 06:16:41,690
What's happening?

7486
06:16:42,150 --> 06:16:43,110
Do I have a save point?

7487
06:16:43,210 --> 06:16:44,890
Wait, am I going to be controlling my own guy?

7488
06:16:45,650 --> 06:16:46,770
Am I controlling my body?

7489
06:16:46,970 --> 06:16:47,610
No, never mind.

7490
06:16:48,930 --> 06:16:50,430
No save point for us.

7491
06:16:52,050 --> 06:16:52,550
Oh!

7492
06:16:54,490 --> 06:16:56,250
She was waiting for us.

7493
06:16:58,690 --> 06:16:58,830
Huh?

7494
06:16:58,830 --> 06:16:59,790
Have you seen what?

7495
06:17:05,350 --> 06:17:06,710
It is Naomi!

7496
06:17:16,210 --> 06:17:18,510
Is she also becoming sexy?

7497
06:17:22,170 --> 06:17:23,150
Calm down!

7498
06:17:24,190 --> 06:17:26,430
Oh shit, I don't want to die here, sorry.

7499
06:17:28,550 --> 06:17:29,730
What do you tell her?

7500
06:17:29,950 --> 06:17:32,530
Sorry guys, I'm not about to go through all of that again.

7501
06:17:35,690 --> 06:17:36,330
Um...

7502
06:17:37,410 --> 06:17:38,050
Sorry.

7503
06:17:38,470 --> 06:17:39,590
What do I tell her?

7504
06:17:40,990 --> 06:17:42,270
What do I tell her?

7505
06:17:42,650 --> 06:17:43,830
Oh, I have to say anything.

7506
06:17:44,010 --> 06:17:44,390
Ok, cool.

7507
06:17:46,070 --> 06:17:46,650
Rio!

7508
06:17:49,090 --> 06:17:50,530
She hears me!

7509
06:17:52,410 --> 06:17:54,110
She hears me from...

7510
06:17:57,390 --> 06:17:58,030
Naomi!

7511
06:18:01,250 --> 06:18:02,270
Don't touch her.

7512
06:18:12,610 --> 06:18:13,530
Naomi...

7513
06:18:13,530 --> 06:18:15,450
No Naomi, you're so sexy!

7514
06:18:15,550 --> 06:18:16,250
Don't die!

7515
06:18:20,670 --> 06:18:21,130
No!

7516
06:18:25,670 --> 06:18:26,590
Aw...

7517
06:18:30,430 --> 06:18:31,350
Naomi...

7518
06:18:32,350 --> 06:18:34,610
She was good this whole time!

7519
06:18:35,650 --> 06:18:42,440
What happened to her?

7520
06:18:44,020 --> 06:18:45,160
She became invisible.

7521
06:18:50,400 --> 06:18:53,080
My girlfriend is dead.

7522
06:18:58,170 --> 06:18:59,930
She got Capri sunned.

7523
06:19:00,630 --> 06:19:01,070
No!

7524
06:19:02,530 --> 06:19:03,350
No!

7525
06:19:06,270 --> 06:19:07,710
Am I...

7526
06:19:08,330 --> 06:19:09,730
Am I cursed?

7527
06:19:11,510 --> 06:19:12,790
They all died.

7528
06:19:13,570 --> 06:19:14,490
Oh no, she's Autocon!

7529
06:19:15,270 --> 06:19:16,870
Command, I couldn't save anyone.

7530
06:19:22,350 --> 06:19:23,790
Could everything...

7531
06:19:24,330 --> 06:19:26,230
Could it all be because of me?

7532
06:19:28,230 --> 06:19:29,170
Uh, maybe.

7533
06:19:29,610 --> 06:19:30,670
You really believe that?

7534
06:19:31,270 --> 06:19:31,790
No.

7535
06:19:31,830 --> 06:19:34,250
This is all... I'm so sorry.

7536
06:19:34,950 --> 06:19:38,910
I'm so sorry to have gotten you and everyone else involved in this horrible mess.

7537
06:19:39,990 --> 06:19:42,490
There's no way for me to repair the damage I've caused.

7538
06:19:42,670 --> 06:19:43,350
No, it's ok.

7539
06:19:44,050 --> 06:19:44,850
Don't worry.

7540
06:19:46,410 --> 06:19:48,570
But Naomi asked me to save you.

7541
06:19:48,770 --> 06:19:49,110
Yeah.

7542
06:19:50,930 --> 06:19:52,530
She said, do you really believe that?

7543
06:19:52,590 --> 06:19:53,270
And I said, nah.

7544
06:19:53,450 --> 06:19:54,470
I will save you.

7545
06:19:58,540 --> 06:19:59,700
Will you wait for me?

7546
06:20:03,160 --> 06:20:04,680
We're trauma bonded now.

7547
06:20:04,680 --> 06:20:06,520
I'll wait for you.

7548
06:20:10,020 --> 06:20:11,820
We're trauma bonded now.

7549
06:20:15,460 --> 06:20:17,060
I don't think this girl can live without me.

7550
06:20:18,480 --> 06:20:19,780
She has no survival instincts.

7551
06:20:22,680 --> 06:20:23,920
Yeah, we've definitely noticed that.

7552
06:20:28,840 --> 06:20:30,180
Why did she die?

7553
06:20:30,520 --> 06:20:32,120
I don't get it.

7554
06:20:32,120 --> 06:20:33,220
I don't get it.

7555
06:20:33,220 --> 06:20:34,600
Why did she die?

7556
06:20:35,660 --> 06:20:38,220
Maybe they have a small life span or something?

7557
06:20:38,340 --> 06:20:40,120
Maybe because they're unstable creatures?

7558
06:20:52,540 --> 06:20:53,820
The music.

7559
06:21:04,860 --> 06:21:05,340
Haha!

7560
06:21:09,720 --> 06:21:11,160
Wait, did that kill all the monsters?

7561
06:21:13,360 --> 06:21:14,620
Oh that's why!

7562
06:21:14,700 --> 06:21:15,300
The brain!

7563
06:21:43,430 --> 06:21:46,970
His mouth is really freaking me out.

7564
06:21:50,650 --> 06:21:52,510
Oh my god!

7565
06:21:56,620 --> 06:21:58,330
Oh my god!

7566
06:22:02,520 --> 06:22:04,770
They're all floating around.

7567
06:22:06,010 --> 06:22:07,170
What is up, anyone?

7568
06:22:10,450 --> 06:22:13,150
All she was doing was asking for her boyfriend.

7569
06:22:25,330 --> 06:22:28,830
Yeah, that's me.

7570
06:22:30,850 --> 06:22:31,770
Yep, I'm here.

7571
06:22:31,910 --> 06:22:31,990
Hi!

7572
06:22:36,010 --> 06:22:37,310
I'll surely die.

7573
06:22:37,490 --> 06:22:39,870
I'm the one who locked him in the monitor room.

7574
06:22:40,950 --> 06:22:43,970
I've been poisoned by a caterpillar!

7575
06:22:45,470 --> 06:22:46,190
No!

7576
06:22:52,910 --> 06:22:55,330
I'm poisoned by a caterpillar!

7577
06:22:56,550 --> 06:22:58,850
So it was you who altered the station's orbit?

7578
06:23:15,710 --> 06:23:17,270
What's wrong with his eyes?

7579
06:23:19,210 --> 06:23:20,070
Oh my god!

7580
06:23:28,870 --> 06:23:29,310
What?

7581
06:23:31,970 --> 06:23:33,530
Are we a mutant too?

7582
06:23:43,450 --> 06:23:44,450
Wait, she is a robot?

7583
06:23:57,070 --> 06:23:58,390
Get yankered!

7584
06:24:05,530 --> 06:24:06,850
No way!

7585
06:24:07,090 --> 06:24:08,510
I got poisoned by a weedle.

7586
06:24:10,130 --> 06:24:14,130
Maybe she's not a robot, maybe she's just like Iron Man, right?

7587
06:24:14,630 --> 06:24:16,050
I can't!

7588
06:24:19,670 --> 06:24:22,030
This is so awesome!

7589
06:24:24,030 --> 06:24:25,770
That's the Philosopher's Stone!

7590
06:24:38,510 --> 06:24:39,270
Ah!

7591
06:24:44,210 --> 06:24:45,690
Oh my god!

7592
06:24:46,770 --> 06:24:48,190
She's the stone!

7593
06:24:51,670 --> 06:24:53,270
Yeah, it's a fake.

7594
06:25:06,490 --> 06:25:07,950
I'm seeing it right now.

7595
06:25:15,510 --> 06:25:16,530
Homoculai?

7596
06:25:16,530 --> 06:25:17,550
Homoculus?

7597
06:25:18,290 --> 06:25:20,790
Wait, homoculai is plural, right?

7598
06:25:23,270 --> 06:25:27,350
I'm dying of worm poisoning!

7599
06:25:30,490 --> 06:25:31,510
Oh

7600
06:25:35,950 --> 06:25:37,850
my god!

7601
06:25:38,230 --> 06:25:40,050
I've become a worm!

7602
06:25:41,490 --> 06:25:43,330
Can we go back and save?

7603
06:25:45,630 --> 06:25:46,650
Hatch 3.

7604
06:25:47,890 --> 06:25:49,650
Yeah, I'm going in there to save.

7605
06:25:51,210 --> 06:25:52,230
Real quick.

7606
06:25:56,970 --> 06:25:58,070
Save point.

7607
06:26:01,470 --> 06:26:10,990
Well, if you have a Philosopher's Stone and you are able to heal all your wounds, then why haven't you been needing healing packs?

7608
06:26:12,070 --> 06:26:13,710
Should have used a ground type.

7609
06:26:14,690 --> 06:26:17,010
Oh my goodness gracious.

7610
06:26:19,250 --> 06:26:20,990
Do I need any of these other things?

7611
06:26:21,070 --> 06:26:21,930
I don't think so anymore.

7612
06:26:22,550 --> 06:26:25,430
Alright, I think we go fight the final boss now.

7613
06:26:25,590 --> 06:26:27,130
Whatever that is, I have no idea.

7614
06:26:27,270 --> 06:26:30,350
I thought it was going to be what turned out to be Naomi.

7615
06:26:31,150 --> 06:26:33,230
Would you still love the Operator if he was a worm?

7616
06:26:36,770 --> 06:26:38,770
The final boss time, whatever that is.

7617
06:26:41,210 --> 06:26:42,930
Hatch 3.

7618
06:26:44,010 --> 06:26:46,770
This game is a wild ride.

7619
06:26:47,670 --> 06:26:50,110
We got like space and magic.

7620
06:26:50,350 --> 06:26:50,910
It's great.

7621
06:26:52,830 --> 06:26:55,030
We got space magic.

7622
06:26:56,840 --> 06:26:59,110
There she goes all on her own.

7623
06:27:00,650 --> 06:27:04,590
Oh, I can't talk?

7624
06:27:06,430 --> 06:27:07,910
Look at her go.

7625
06:27:07,910 --> 06:27:13,650
Now we know why some enemies have glowing weak spots that need to be shot to kill them.

7626
06:27:14,530 --> 06:27:15,650
Wait, what do you mean by that?

7627
06:27:17,750 --> 06:27:22,650
The reason why you can't have a Philosopher's Stone is if you die and get revived, you become stupid.

7628
06:27:24,470 --> 06:27:25,330
It's true.

7629
06:27:26,770 --> 06:27:27,650
Hatch 6.

7630
06:27:27,930 --> 06:27:29,410
She's on a mission.

7631
06:27:29,530 --> 06:27:30,830
I don't need to tell her what to do anymore.

7632
06:27:31,470 --> 06:27:31,950
Oh, okay.

7633
06:27:33,210 --> 06:27:36,010
The stone is already activated via tongue twister.

7634
06:27:38,970 --> 06:27:40,390
This is so cool.

7635
06:27:40,750 --> 06:27:43,030
Do you think we are going to be floating in the final battle?

7636
06:27:43,290 --> 06:27:45,590
I might be upset about that.

7637
06:27:46,510 --> 06:27:48,490
Good morning Ryo and other person.

7638
06:27:49,770 --> 06:27:51,170
Glen Jammin, thanks for 10 pounds.

7639
06:27:54,950 --> 06:27:55,950
Oh my god!

7640
06:27:57,290 --> 06:28:00,390
It's a whole birthing place of fake stones.

7641
06:28:08,570 --> 06:28:10,310
Too many fake stones.

7642
06:28:15,650 --> 06:28:17,410
Take them out!

7643
06:28:23,890 --> 06:28:25,350
Take it out Ryo!

7644
06:28:25,510 --> 06:28:26,510
Take it out!

7645
06:28:27,150 --> 06:28:28,230
All your anger.

7646
06:28:30,370 --> 06:28:34,530
Also, we only have probably 20 minutes left or so until we crash into Earth.

7647
06:28:39,110 --> 06:28:40,890
What can we do?

7648
06:28:45,490 --> 06:28:46,990
Don't cut yourself.

7649
06:28:48,970 --> 06:28:50,430
What do we do?

7650
06:28:52,210 --> 06:28:52,910
Something.

7651
06:29:07,910 --> 06:29:09,250
Who programs them?

7652
06:29:12,690 --> 06:29:13,170
Why?

7653
06:29:13,990 --> 06:29:21,710
In case it all goes really to shit, I guess.

7654
06:29:29,470 --> 06:29:30,610
What's what?

7655
06:29:30,610 --> 06:29:31,110
What's this?

7656
06:29:37,710 --> 06:29:38,990
That's where I am.

7657
06:29:43,010 --> 06:29:44,770
Am I the final boss?

7658
06:29:47,830 --> 06:29:48,530
Yes.

7659
06:29:52,050 --> 06:29:53,770
What was the point of the bomb then?

7660
06:29:57,790 --> 06:29:58,890
Of course.

7661
06:30:00,610 --> 06:30:02,070
Why was I zooming in?

7662
06:30:04,050 --> 06:30:05,030
I'm a caterpillar!

7663
06:30:10,630 --> 06:30:14,450
This guy was still alive!

7664
06:30:23,250 --> 06:30:24,650
Ah man!

7665
06:30:24,650 --> 06:30:25,290
Man!

7666
06:30:28,990 --> 06:30:30,090
A set of nuclear weapons.

7667
06:30:30,190 --> 06:30:31,790
This game has the philosopher's stone.

7668
06:30:32,010 --> 06:30:35,210
Ah man!

7669
06:30:38,030 --> 06:30:38,670
What?

7670
06:30:42,470 --> 06:30:43,150
I did?

7671
06:30:45,150 --> 06:30:45,770
I'm a worm?

7672
06:30:49,530 --> 06:30:50,850
I'm a worm!

7673
06:30:51,750 --> 06:30:52,970
She said something there.

7674
06:30:52,990 --> 06:30:54,030
I couldn't understand it.

7675
06:30:56,150 --> 06:30:58,610
I'm losing my capability of human speech.

7676
06:31:06,550 --> 06:31:07,850
Shoot him now!

7677
06:31:08,270 --> 06:31:08,650
Yeah, yeah.

7678
06:31:08,670 --> 06:31:09,050
Good idea.

7679
06:31:12,590 --> 06:31:13,570
Good, good Rio.

7680
06:31:13,690 --> 06:31:14,230
Don't hesitate.

7681
06:31:14,910 --> 06:31:15,310
Kill!

7682
06:31:15,450 --> 06:31:15,790
Kill!

7683
06:31:15,890 --> 06:31:16,150
Kill!

7684
06:31:16,230 --> 06:31:16,470
Shoot!

7685
06:31:16,770 --> 06:31:17,250
Shoot!

7686
06:31:21,640 --> 06:31:22,090
Wow!

7687
06:31:28,110 --> 06:31:29,410
You'll need the left joystick.

7688
06:31:29,630 --> 06:31:30,050
I will?

7689
06:31:33,370 --> 06:31:34,210
No!

7690
06:31:41,900 --> 06:31:42,550
What the?

7691
06:31:53,440 --> 06:31:55,330
I can't understand your accent.

7692
06:32:03,970 --> 06:32:04,690
Eww!

7693
06:32:06,470 --> 06:32:06,910
Eww!

7694
06:32:09,810 --> 06:32:11,910
I don't want to fight this.

7695
06:32:17,550 --> 06:32:18,270
OK!

7696
06:32:21,370 --> 06:32:22,870
Wait, do I just glide?

7697
06:32:23,830 --> 06:32:24,590
Is that what I'm doing?

7698
06:32:25,310 --> 06:32:26,430
What's going on?

7699
06:32:27,770 --> 06:32:28,970
Am I moving?

7700
06:32:29,130 --> 06:32:29,790
Not shooting?

7701
06:32:33,210 --> 06:32:34,790
Rio is a free thinker now.

7702
06:32:34,850 --> 06:32:35,710
She doesn't need me.

7703
06:32:42,860 --> 06:32:45,660
He's gotta squeeze his fat ass through the tube first.

7704
06:32:48,800 --> 06:32:52,240
I'll forgive being evil scientist, but not misogyny!

7705
06:32:52,800 --> 06:32:53,280
Yeah!

7706
06:32:53,560 --> 06:32:55,780
We draw the line at evil whore!

7707
06:33:05,900 --> 06:33:06,500
Fall?

7708
06:33:08,500 --> 06:33:09,100
OK!

7709
06:33:15,220 --> 06:33:15,940
No way!

7710
06:33:17,540 --> 06:33:22,160
Wait, but what about... how do I use that to leave as well?

7711
06:33:23,800 --> 06:33:25,640
Wait, you're escaping?

7712
06:33:27,020 --> 06:33:27,900
And without me, right?

7713
06:33:32,160 --> 06:33:32,760
Wait...

7714
06:33:38,800 --> 06:33:39,360
Alright.

7715
06:33:39,920 --> 06:33:40,320
OK.

7716
06:33:40,780 --> 06:33:42,800
Wait, but turning it on makes it go.

7717
06:33:50,440 --> 06:33:51,700
Oh no, he's invisible.

7718
06:33:52,620 --> 06:33:53,740
I don't like that.

7719
06:33:55,760 --> 06:33:57,020
Oh my god and he's bigger!

7720
06:33:59,500 --> 06:34:01,000
What are you mumbling about?

7721
06:34:01,040 --> 06:34:02,460
I can't understand you!

7722
06:34:03,420 --> 06:34:04,980
Oh my god!

7723
06:34:09,310 --> 06:34:10,760
This doesn't seem very fair.

7724
06:34:11,440 --> 06:34:12,620
What's happening?

7725
06:34:14,440 --> 06:34:15,520
What is happening?

7726
06:34:18,500 --> 06:34:19,680
Turn on!

7727
06:34:21,000 --> 06:34:21,700
Turn on!

7728
06:34:25,880 --> 06:34:26,740
Wait,

7729
06:34:34,750 --> 06:34:35,430
how do I move?

7730
06:34:37,210 --> 06:34:37,650
Down!

7731
06:34:44,200 --> 06:34:44,640
Left!

7732
06:34:45,940 --> 06:34:46,740
How do I move?

7733
06:34:47,180 --> 06:34:47,680
Left stick?

7734
06:34:47,760 --> 06:34:49,040
I'm using it, but it's not working!

7735
06:34:49,380 --> 06:34:51,720
Wait, my left stick is not working, you guys.

7736
06:34:52,520 --> 06:34:54,260
My stick is not...

7737
06:34:54,260 --> 06:34:56,020
My actual controller is not working.

7738
06:34:56,160 --> 06:34:56,700
It's not working.

7739
06:34:56,780 --> 06:34:57,600
My stick is not working.

7740
06:35:04,330 --> 06:35:05,590
Oh, it's D-pad.

7741
06:35:05,830 --> 06:35:07,650
It's D-pad.

7742
06:35:08,390 --> 06:35:09,030
It's D-pad.

7743
06:35:09,170 --> 06:35:09,550
Right!

7744
06:35:17,730 --> 06:35:18,310
OK.

7745
06:35:18,510 --> 06:35:19,750
It scared me.

7746
06:35:25,670 --> 06:35:26,590
What do I do?

7747
06:35:55,640 --> 06:35:57,280
Damn it, I missed it.

7748
06:36:00,500 --> 06:36:01,860
Where is hers?

7749
06:36:01,960 --> 06:36:02,760
I can't see hers.

7750
06:36:03,000 --> 06:36:03,680
I can't see hers.

7751
06:36:03,800 --> 06:36:05,220
Oh jeez, there's so many.

7752
06:36:06,700 --> 06:36:08,000
I can't see hers.

7753
06:36:08,840 --> 06:36:09,400
Right!

7754
06:36:10,980 --> 06:36:11,400
Lower!

7755
06:36:11,740 --> 06:36:12,020
Down!

7756
06:36:13,220 --> 06:36:13,800
Left!

7757
06:36:13,800 --> 06:36:14,400
Left!

7758
06:36:16,780 --> 06:36:17,000
Down!

7759
06:36:17,320 --> 06:36:17,960
Oh shoot!

7760
06:36:18,460 --> 06:36:21,060
Those were mine.

7761
06:36:21,140 --> 06:36:21,880
I should have gotten those.

7762
06:36:21,940 --> 06:36:22,400
That's my bad.

7763
06:36:27,110 --> 06:36:28,690
Can we get him now?

7764
06:36:29,150 --> 06:36:29,670
Oh my gosh.

7765
06:36:30,130 --> 06:36:30,690
Right!

7766
06:36:38,950 --> 06:36:40,790
This is so hard.

7767
06:36:40,910 --> 06:36:41,490
Oh my gosh.

7768
06:36:41,750 --> 06:36:42,130
Down!

7769
06:36:43,290 --> 06:36:43,510
Down

7770
06:36:49,100 --> 06:36:49,960
his ass!

7771
06:36:50,480 --> 06:36:51,020
A little bit.

7772
06:36:51,200 --> 06:36:51,480
Right!

7773
06:36:53,100 --> 06:36:53,660
Middle!

7774
06:36:53,660 --> 06:36:54,220
Left!

7775
06:36:54,880 --> 06:36:55,880
Oh my god.

7776
06:36:56,360 --> 06:36:57,080
Oh shoot.

7777
06:36:59,860 --> 06:37:00,460
OK.

7778
06:37:00,820 --> 06:37:02,600
This could be worse I suppose.

7779
06:37:05,240 --> 06:37:07,060
This is such a bizarre fight.

7780
06:37:07,200 --> 06:37:07,800
I'm not gonna lie.

7781
06:37:10,320 --> 06:37:10,920
Left!

7782
06:37:12,000 --> 06:37:12,440
Oh shoot.

7783
06:37:17,920 --> 06:37:19,580
Did that hurt us?

7784
06:37:19,740 --> 06:37:22,740
I don't know actually.

7785
06:37:23,280 --> 06:37:23,940
Did that hurt us?

7786
06:37:24,440 --> 06:37:24,740
No.

7787
06:37:24,960 --> 06:37:25,260
Right!

7788
06:37:26,180 --> 06:37:26,780
Right!

7789
06:37:27,700 --> 06:37:28,020
Up!

7790
06:37:29,480 --> 06:37:30,080
Left!

7791
06:37:32,400 --> 06:37:33,820
Oh my god.

7792
06:37:34,200 --> 06:37:35,440
This is kinda slow.

7793
06:37:35,840 --> 06:37:37,600
I don't think I like this very much.

7794
06:37:38,660 --> 06:37:40,500
It's like slow and weird.

7795
06:37:41,340 --> 06:37:42,300
I don't like it.

7796
06:37:43,160 --> 06:37:44,440
And we are already half health.

7797
06:37:44,980 --> 06:37:45,560
Oh my gosh.

7798
06:37:46,380 --> 06:37:46,980
Down!

7799
06:37:47,880 --> 06:37:48,480
Right!

7800
06:37:49,360 --> 06:37:49,680
Right!

7801
06:37:59,380 --> 06:38:00,420
Oh my god.

7802
06:38:00,660 --> 06:38:01,580
We missed our chance.

7803
06:38:04,660 --> 06:38:06,500
I can't use a heal pack.

7804
06:38:08,160 --> 06:38:08,600
Heal!

7805
06:38:09,400 --> 06:38:09,840
Recover!

7806
06:38:11,240 --> 06:38:11,880
Oh actually.

7807
06:38:12,140 --> 06:38:12,420
Down!

7808
06:38:13,820 --> 06:38:14,260
Left!

7809
06:38:14,840 --> 06:38:15,260
Oh OK.

7810
06:38:15,420 --> 06:38:15,820
You got it.

7811
06:38:15,940 --> 06:38:16,160
Nice.

7812
06:38:16,260 --> 06:38:16,700
Good job girl.

7813
06:38:17,520 --> 06:38:17,980
I got it.

7814
06:38:19,180 --> 06:38:21,720
I wish she would use her own eyes but you know.

7815
06:38:22,380 --> 06:38:24,360
I ask for so much in this game don't I?

7816
06:38:26,140 --> 06:38:26,580
Down!

7817
06:38:27,480 --> 06:38:27,900
Right!

7818
06:38:27,900 --> 06:38:28,380
Right!

7819
06:38:41,480 --> 06:38:43,360
Oh I think they are getting tougher maybe.

7820
06:38:45,620 --> 06:38:47,380
Oh he is only half way.

7821
06:38:53,470 --> 06:38:55,750
And we are close to dying actually.

7822
06:38:57,290 --> 06:38:58,910
Oh let me get these.

7823
06:39:01,370 --> 06:39:01,970
Down!

7824
06:39:01,970 --> 06:39:02,570
Right!

7825
06:39:08,000 --> 06:39:08,600
Left!

7826
06:39:10,420 --> 06:39:11,980
Did I hit him at all?

7827
06:39:12,220 --> 06:39:13,040
I don't think I did.

7828
06:39:13,040 --> 06:39:14,080
It sucks!

7829
06:39:16,220 --> 06:39:18,140
Oh I

7830
06:39:22,680 --> 06:39:25,400
have to go through all of that again.

7831
06:39:26,060 --> 06:39:29,740
I have to go through all of those cutscenes.

7832
06:39:30,920 --> 06:39:33,040
All over again.

7833
06:39:35,360 --> 06:39:36,400
Wow

7834
06:39:41,380 --> 06:39:43,000
Wow Wow

7835
06:39:49,410 --> 06:39:59,430
Exit How much of the play time is repeating cutscenes?

7836
06:39:59,590 --> 06:40:01,110
Oh my gosh.

7837
06:40:01,170 --> 06:40:04,510
This was like 15 minutes of cutscene I feel.

7838
06:40:05,830 --> 06:40:06,850
No way.

7839
06:40:07,970 --> 06:40:09,530
No way.

7840
06:40:17,390 --> 06:40:18,710
I can't talk.

7841
06:40:18,950 --> 06:40:19,870
It won't let me.

7842
06:40:23,710 --> 06:40:24,230
Where?

7843
06:40:24,230 --> 06:40:25,910
Did she die already?

7844
06:40:26,210 --> 06:40:26,870
I guess so.

7845
06:40:26,930 --> 06:40:28,390
We are going to go to...

7846
06:40:28,910 --> 06:40:29,430
Run

7847
06:40:33,310 --> 06:40:35,570
Yup that did much of a difference.

7848
06:40:51,240 --> 06:40:52,080
Oh man.

7849
06:40:53,420 --> 06:40:55,220
Are you kidding me right now?

7850
06:40:55,940 --> 06:40:58,560
Hold on I am going to read the game facts and see if there is a cheat.

7851
06:41:08,960 --> 06:41:11,760
They don't deal much damage to you even if they hit you.

7852
06:41:12,020 --> 06:41:14,040
I think they do deal a bit of damage.

7853
06:41:14,080 --> 06:41:15,540
That's how we died from those.

7854
06:41:22,150 --> 06:41:24,490
I am going to go to the bathroom real quick guys.

7855
06:41:24,550 --> 06:41:25,090
I'll be right back.

7856
06:41:27,550 --> 06:41:28,390
I'll be right back.

7857
06:41:29,050 --> 06:41:30,690
I might do a save state.

7858
06:41:30,790 --> 06:41:31,550
I am not going to lie.

7859
06:41:32,950 --> 06:41:34,510
I wonder if I should just do a save state.

7860
06:41:37,510 --> 06:41:38,950
That's the real cheating baby.

7861
06:41:41,930 --> 06:41:42,270
Sheesha

7862
06:41:52,790 --> 06:41:53,730
Okay I'll do one.

7863
06:41:54,450 --> 06:41:56,050
I'll do one once we get to the final boss.

7864
06:41:56,190 --> 06:41:56,690
I'll be right back.

7865
06:42:42,960 --> 06:42:46,500
We'll blow up the station and these stones before they can be used on earth.

7866
06:42:48,960 --> 06:42:49,980
Wait for me.

7867
06:42:50,720 --> 06:42:51,560
I'll be right there.

7868
06:43:08,690 --> 06:43:09,710
This is it.

7869
06:43:11,090 --> 06:43:12,350
The monitor room.

7870
06:43:14,010 --> 06:43:15,310
There is no mistake.

7871
06:43:15,810 --> 06:43:17,270
I finally made it.

7872
06:43:18,710 --> 06:43:20,090
You are inside of here.

7873
06:43:26,230 --> 06:43:26,830
Hi.

7874
06:43:27,830 --> 06:43:28,850
Can you see me?

7875
06:43:28,850 --> 06:43:29,450
Yeah.

7876
06:43:41,910 --> 06:43:42,610
It's okay.

7877
06:43:43,610 --> 06:43:45,530
It doesn't matter if you can't see me on camera.

7878
06:43:46,850 --> 06:43:48,070
You'll see me soon enough.

7879
06:43:49,910 --> 06:43:51,470
Is it alright if I come in?

7880
06:43:57,750 --> 06:43:59,890
Why does it look... Yes.

7881
06:44:00,290 --> 06:44:00,550
Alright.

7882
06:44:02,650 --> 06:44:03,170
Wow.

7883
06:44:03,570 --> 06:44:04,810
My pulse is pounding.

7884
06:44:05,890 --> 06:44:06,950
Even though I don't have a heart.

7885
06:44:09,090 --> 06:44:12,170
Where do you think you are going?

7886
06:44:13,850 --> 06:44:15,210
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

7887
06:44:17,990 --> 06:44:21,150
I'm going to go get some more water too.

7888
06:44:21,410 --> 06:44:21,730
Sorry.

7889
06:44:22,010 --> 06:44:23,070
I only went to the bathroom.

7890
06:44:26,110 --> 06:44:27,350
I'm going to go get some more water.

7891
06:44:27,690 --> 06:44:28,650
We're almost done guys.

7892
06:44:28,670 --> 06:44:29,270
We got this.

7893
06:44:29,630 --> 06:44:31,430
Just one last fight and then the end.

7894
06:44:32,810 --> 06:44:33,270
One more fight.

7895
06:44:33,330 --> 06:44:34,250
Oh, water.

7896
06:44:38,950 --> 06:44:42,330
You became a monster long ago.

7897
06:44:46,050 --> 06:44:47,510
You liar.

7898
06:44:48,150 --> 06:44:48,830
Believe me.

7899
06:44:49,210 --> 06:44:50,450
I will save you.

7900
06:44:51,830 --> 06:44:52,550
You too.

7901
06:44:53,650 --> 06:44:56,090
You'll become dust here.

7902
06:45:00,210 --> 06:45:01,610
Become dust?

7903
06:45:01,990 --> 06:45:05,430
The only thing that's becoming dust is you.

7904
06:45:18,360 --> 06:45:22,220
How dare you, you bloody whore.

7905
06:45:22,760 --> 06:45:24,180
Bitch, you're dead.

7906
06:45:24,440 --> 06:45:27,000
I'm going to crush the life out of you.

7907
06:45:27,740 --> 06:45:28,840
I'm not getting away.

7908
06:45:29,180 --> 06:45:30,780
I'm not getting away with this.

7909
06:45:52,670 --> 06:45:54,190
L2 allows you to skip?

7910
06:46:03,520 --> 06:46:06,180
L1, L2, R2, R1.

7911
06:46:06,800 --> 06:46:08,140
Nope, nothing let me skip.

7912
06:46:08,480 --> 06:46:10,000
I'm holding down L2.

7913
06:46:11,260 --> 06:46:12,120
Nope, nothing.

7914
06:46:15,280 --> 06:46:16,000
Go diagonal.

7915
06:46:18,040 --> 06:46:18,880
Can I say that?

7916
06:46:19,000 --> 06:46:20,420
Like upper left, lower right?

7917
06:46:20,520 --> 06:46:21,160
Can I say that?

7918
06:46:21,280 --> 06:46:24,600
Instead of just saying left, like left, down.

7919
06:46:24,820 --> 06:46:26,140
Can I say upper left?

7920
06:46:27,400 --> 06:46:28,180
Can I do that?

7921
06:46:28,280 --> 06:46:28,660
I can?

7922
06:46:28,800 --> 06:46:29,660
Oh, ok, ok, ok.

7923
06:46:29,800 --> 06:46:30,740
She did it once accidentally.

7924
06:46:31,140 --> 06:46:32,140
Oh, ok, ok, ok, ok.

7925
06:46:32,940 --> 06:46:33,520
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

7926
06:46:33,580 --> 06:46:34,140
Thank you, thank you.

7927
06:46:34,960 --> 06:46:36,060
I'm holding L1.

7928
06:46:36,340 --> 06:46:36,940
Nah, still no.

7929
06:46:38,120 --> 06:46:38,480
Boo!

7930
06:46:39,980 --> 06:46:40,820
Boo!

7931
06:46:41,500 --> 06:46:42,280
Still, yeah.

7932
06:46:43,100 --> 06:46:45,480
R1, R2, L2, L1.

7933
06:46:45,620 --> 06:46:45,820
Nope.

7934
06:46:53,080 --> 06:46:55,220
Have you tried saying skip?

7935
06:46:57,680 --> 06:46:58,520
Skip!

7936
06:46:58,520 --> 06:46:59,360
L3.

7937
06:47:00,360 --> 06:47:00,780
Nope.

7938
06:47:02,220 --> 06:47:03,220
Oh yeah, the save state.

7939
06:47:03,360 --> 06:47:04,100
Let's do it right here.

7940
06:47:05,040 --> 06:47:05,860
Save state.

7941
06:47:07,560 --> 06:47:08,040
Save.

7942
06:47:08,700 --> 06:47:09,200
Yeah!

7943
06:47:09,660 --> 06:47:10,200
Ok.

7944
06:47:10,200 --> 06:47:10,300
Ok.

7945
06:47:12,560 --> 06:47:13,840
We saved it right here.

7946
06:47:15,240 --> 06:47:17,460
L4, L5, L6.

7947
06:47:20,080 --> 06:47:21,560
Oh, little girl, hold on.

7948
06:47:27,810 --> 06:47:29,190
She wanted in her bed.

7949
06:47:31,570 --> 06:47:32,290
There you go, baby girl.

7950
06:47:33,030 --> 06:47:34,030
A little princess.

7951
06:47:37,910 --> 06:47:40,110
I never claimed that this was real hardware.

7952
06:47:45,130 --> 06:47:47,090
Sorry, I don't actually own this game.

7953
06:47:47,250 --> 06:47:52,050
But also, it would have been very difficult to play with the mic setup and everything.

7954
06:47:58,310 --> 06:48:00,810
Maybe I should have done a save state.

7955
06:48:02,010 --> 06:48:04,990
Let's do, like, once we're really ready to start.

7956
06:48:05,130 --> 06:48:05,750
Ok, 2.

7957
06:48:05,990 --> 06:48:06,310
There we go.

7958
06:48:06,310 --> 06:48:06,310
Boo!

7959
06:48:06,870 --> 06:48:07,310
Boo!

7960
06:48:12,030 --> 06:48:12,610
Ok.

7961
06:48:13,630 --> 06:48:15,070
Alright, cool, cool, cool.

7962
06:48:23,130 --> 06:48:23,990
I'm on.

7963
06:48:24,210 --> 06:48:25,430
I'm turned on.

7964
06:48:25,730 --> 06:48:26,650
I'm turned on.

7965
06:48:26,930 --> 06:48:27,410
There we go.

7966
06:48:27,510 --> 06:48:28,510
Alright, I'm turned on.

7967
06:48:31,630 --> 06:48:32,210
Ok.

7968
06:48:39,050 --> 06:48:40,110
There we are.

7969
06:48:42,550 --> 06:48:43,430
Very good.

7970
06:48:48,210 --> 06:48:48,810
Left!

7971
06:48:51,850 --> 06:48:52,430
Right!

7972
06:48:56,770 --> 06:48:59,550
At least they go one side at a time, which is not so bad.

7973
06:49:01,670 --> 06:49:03,070
Why are you guys blushing?

7974
06:49:05,730 --> 06:49:08,330
Is it because you like the monster man?

7975
06:49:08,330 --> 06:49:09,430
It's no

7976
06:49:15,790 --> 06:49:17,830
good!

7977
06:49:21,600 --> 06:49:22,360
Ok.

7978
06:49:23,820 --> 06:49:24,520
Upper right!

7979
06:49:32,690 --> 06:49:33,450
Down!

7980
06:49:34,430 --> 06:49:34,950
Left!

7981
06:49:42,110 --> 06:49:42,690
Oh my god.

7982
06:49:43,630 --> 06:49:44,390
Up!

7983
06:49:45,610 --> 06:49:46,510
Girl, seriously?

7984
06:49:46,890 --> 06:49:48,190
You're gonna be like that right now.

7985
06:49:49,030 --> 06:49:51,090
You better, you better, you better not.

7986
06:49:51,890 --> 06:49:52,330
Ugh.

7987
06:49:55,730 --> 06:49:56,530
Bottom right!

7988
06:49:58,130 --> 06:49:58,570
Down!

7989
06:49:59,650 --> 06:50:00,210
Oh my gosh.

7990
06:50:00,650 --> 06:50:00,990
Never mind.

7991
06:50:01,110 --> 06:50:01,350
Left!

7992
06:50:04,900 --> 06:50:05,280
Down!

7993
06:50:05,440 --> 06:50:06,360
Oh, that's me, that's me.

7994
06:50:06,580 --> 06:50:08,280
Oh shit, that's my bad.

7995
06:50:08,380 --> 06:50:10,680
Oh, I hate the depth perception on this, you guys.

7996
06:50:11,260 --> 06:50:13,940
Oh, the depth perception is really gonna kick my ass here.

7997
06:50:16,740 --> 06:50:17,620
Oh, sorry.

7998
06:50:19,560 --> 06:50:20,780
Upper right!

7999
06:50:21,760 --> 06:50:22,360
Right!

8000
06:50:30,730 --> 06:50:31,510
Ok.

8001
06:50:32,850 --> 06:50:34,150
Oh, that's me.

8002
06:50:34,570 --> 06:50:38,270
And it's so hard to see them too, when he like summons them.

8003
06:50:39,370 --> 06:50:40,410
It's so hard to see.

8004
06:50:48,070 --> 06:50:49,630
Bottom right!

8005
06:50:54,890 --> 06:50:55,390
Left!

8006
06:50:56,230 --> 06:50:56,670
Left!

8007
06:51:00,300 --> 06:51:01,220
What the hell?

8008
06:51:01,540 --> 06:51:02,140
Kill that thing?

8009
06:51:02,520 --> 06:51:02,900
There we go.

8010
06:51:03,620 --> 06:51:05,860
The depth perception is so bad here.

8011
06:51:05,960 --> 06:51:07,020
Holy moly.

8012
06:51:07,580 --> 06:51:10,020
I am struggling a whole lot.

8013
06:51:10,760 --> 06:51:11,120
Right!

8014
06:51:12,160 --> 06:51:12,800
Left!

8015
06:51:17,790 --> 06:51:19,390
Ok, I think he's about to summon.

8016
06:51:19,570 --> 06:51:20,590
Bottom right!

8017
06:51:21,370 --> 06:51:21,950
Bottom right!

8018
06:51:22,730 --> 06:51:23,110
Down!

8019
06:51:23,930 --> 06:51:24,250
Right!

8020
06:51:33,000 --> 06:51:34,180
I'm too slow!

8021
06:51:34,500 --> 06:51:35,140
I'm too slow!

8022
06:51:36,040 --> 06:51:36,860
Right!

8023
06:51:37,260 --> 06:51:38,060
Right!

8024
06:51:39,280 --> 06:51:40,100
Left!

8025
06:51:46,940 --> 06:51:48,180
Bottom right!

8026
06:51:52,220 --> 06:51:54,140
Oh my gosh, wait, me too.

8027
06:52:01,780 --> 06:52:04,180
I think I should just reload.

8028
06:52:05,400 --> 06:52:06,860
Try saying lower right.

8029
06:52:06,940 --> 06:52:07,160
Up!

8030
06:52:08,100 --> 06:52:08,420
Up!

8031
06:52:09,060 --> 06:52:09,880
Left!

8032
06:52:16,020 --> 06:52:18,360
Oh, I think I should just reload at this point.

8033
06:52:19,740 --> 06:52:20,180
Right!

8034
06:52:22,740 --> 06:52:24,000
Oh my god.

8035
06:52:24,180 --> 06:52:25,940
I forgot what it's like to play a game.

8036
06:52:26,600 --> 06:52:27,380
Lower right!

8037
06:52:37,030 --> 06:52:38,610
Don't know my left from my right!

8038
06:52:48,080 --> 06:52:49,000
Oh wait, that's me.

8039
06:52:49,520 --> 06:52:49,900
Down!

8040
06:52:59,700 --> 06:53:00,340
We got that.

8041
06:53:00,440 --> 06:53:00,920
Oh yeah.

8042
06:53:01,340 --> 06:53:01,920
Lower right!

8043
06:53:01,920 --> 06:53:02,840
Lower right!

8044
06:53:11,540 --> 06:53:12,580
Ok, ok, not bad.

8045
06:53:12,880 --> 06:53:13,380
Right!

8046
06:53:13,760 --> 06:53:14,140
Right!

8047
06:53:16,100 --> 06:53:16,740
Ok.

8048
06:53:17,080 --> 06:53:17,520
Left!

8049
06:53:18,580 --> 06:53:19,660
Ok, ok.

8050
06:53:21,640 --> 06:53:23,240
I got it, I got it.

8051
06:53:23,520 --> 06:53:23,860
Maybe.

8052
06:53:24,760 --> 06:53:25,760
Where are they coming from?

8053
06:53:25,840 --> 06:53:26,140
Down!

8054
06:53:27,300 --> 06:53:27,880
Right!

8055
06:53:37,830 --> 06:53:38,370
Damn it.

8056
06:53:45,320 --> 06:53:46,360
Holy moly.

8057
06:53:46,620 --> 06:53:47,860
Just one more try maybe.

8058
06:53:48,340 --> 06:53:49,540
As long as I don't get hit.

8059
06:53:59,770 --> 06:54:00,290
Left!

8060
06:54:00,290 --> 06:54:00,810
Down!

8061
06:54:01,010 --> 06:54:01,470
Lower left!

8062
06:54:21,680 --> 06:54:22,640
So close!

8063
06:54:25,500 --> 06:54:26,780
I'm getting the hang of it.

8064
06:54:28,020 --> 06:54:29,040
I'm getting the hang of it.

8065
06:54:29,040 --> 06:54:29,720
Operator!

8066
06:54:29,980 --> 06:54:30,700
Let's go!

8067
06:54:35,600 --> 06:54:37,340
Use the left thruster to attack.

8068
06:54:38,140 --> 06:54:38,420
Again!

8069
06:54:39,560 --> 06:54:40,540
Where should I aim?

8070
06:54:41,180 --> 06:54:42,840
Tell me up, down, left, right.

8071
06:54:42,900 --> 06:54:43,260
Ok!

8072
06:54:44,860 --> 06:54:45,420
Let's go!

8073
06:54:52,460 --> 06:54:54,660
And I didn't use safe spaces the entire time.

8074
06:54:54,740 --> 06:54:55,020
Left!

8075
06:54:55,360 --> 06:54:55,960
Upper left!

8076
06:54:56,080 --> 06:54:56,820
No, down!

8077
06:54:57,300 --> 06:54:57,360
Down!

8078
06:54:58,720 --> 06:54:59,240
Right!

8079
06:54:59,660 --> 06:54:59,960
Right!

8080
06:55:05,090 --> 06:55:05,710
Right!

8081
06:55:07,050 --> 06:55:07,670
It's

8082
06:55:13,260 --> 06:55:16,020
only to avoid the cutscenes honestly.

8083
06:55:16,940 --> 06:55:20,800
Otherwise I would have been fine with doing it, you know, but...

8084
06:55:24,580 --> 06:55:25,200
Yeah.

8085
06:55:51,970 --> 06:55:52,280
Left!

8086
06:55:54,440 --> 06:55:55,500
Help me out a little.

8087
06:55:55,700 --> 06:55:55,920
Right!

8088
06:55:57,260 --> 06:55:57,740
Down!

8089
06:56:02,810 --> 06:56:03,430
Right!

8090
06:56:03,430 --> 06:56:04,610
Up!

8091
06:56:12,510 --> 06:56:13,410
I can't tell.

8092
06:56:14,910 --> 06:56:15,910
That works, yeah.

8093
06:56:28,590 --> 06:56:30,750
Is that hitting him when she does it?

8094
06:56:30,790 --> 06:56:31,570
I don't know actually.

8095
06:56:32,870 --> 06:56:33,710
I don't think so.

8096
06:56:34,050 --> 06:56:34,310
Right!

8097
06:56:40,360 --> 06:56:40,800
Ok.

8098
06:56:50,910 --> 06:56:51,870
Upper right!

8099
06:57:04,260 --> 06:57:05,720
Has to be the left positioning?

8100
06:57:05,980 --> 06:57:06,160
Ok.

8101
06:57:07,220 --> 06:57:08,060
It's ok.

8102
06:57:08,340 --> 06:57:08,760
Right!

8103
06:57:10,820 --> 06:57:11,380
Oh shoot.

8104
06:57:11,860 --> 06:57:12,480
Left!

8105
06:57:14,160 --> 06:57:14,560
Up!

8106
06:57:15,780 --> 06:57:16,880
Ok, nice!

8107
06:57:17,000 --> 06:57:17,520
Nice, nice, nice.

8108
06:57:17,900 --> 06:57:18,320
Right!

8109
06:57:19,780 --> 06:57:20,340
Down!

8110
06:57:22,120 --> 06:57:22,680
Left?

8111
06:57:23,740 --> 06:57:24,080
Right?

8112
06:57:26,220 --> 06:57:27,000
Where is it?

8113
06:57:27,060 --> 06:57:27,980
Oh, nice, nice, nice!

8114
06:57:29,220 --> 06:57:29,780
Holy!

8115
06:57:31,880 --> 06:57:32,560
Upper right!

8116
06:57:33,840 --> 06:57:35,960
Oh, me too, me too.

8117
06:57:36,100 --> 06:57:36,320
Sorry.

8118
06:57:37,500 --> 06:57:38,060
Alright.

8119
06:57:38,660 --> 06:57:38,920
Left!

8120
06:57:39,800 --> 06:57:40,360
Down!

8121
06:57:41,220 --> 06:57:41,440
Left!

8122
06:57:44,820 --> 06:57:45,020
Right!

8123
06:57:45,460 --> 06:57:46,500
Oh, we missed it.

8124
06:57:46,560 --> 06:57:47,040
Dang it, it's ok.

8125
06:57:49,840 --> 06:57:50,240
Up!

8126
06:57:53,200 --> 06:57:53,840
Did I get out?

8127
06:57:53,980 --> 06:57:54,240
Right!

8128
06:57:55,180 --> 06:57:55,760
There we go.

8129
06:57:56,700 --> 06:57:57,500
Oh my gosh!

8130
06:57:57,540 --> 06:57:58,140
Oh my gosh!

8131
06:57:58,160 --> 06:57:59,080
I'm so stressed right now!

8132
06:57:59,840 --> 06:58:00,740
It's not even that hard!

8133
06:58:00,920 --> 06:58:01,140
Left!

8134
06:58:02,080 --> 06:58:02,480
Left!

8135
06:58:03,480 --> 06:58:03,660
Up!

8136
06:58:04,960 --> 06:58:06,820
Oh dammit, I should have gotten that one.

8137
06:58:07,400 --> 06:58:08,820
I didn't realize it was...

8138
06:58:11,400 --> 06:58:12,140
Bottom right!

8139
06:58:12,760 --> 06:58:14,020
No, bottom right!

8140
06:58:14,840 --> 06:58:15,200
Down!

8141
06:58:17,160 --> 06:58:19,260
We have to avoid him doing the...

8142
06:58:19,260 --> 06:58:19,460
Up!

8143
06:58:20,360 --> 06:58:20,760
Left!

8144
06:58:21,100 --> 06:58:21,360
Left!

8145
06:58:22,760 --> 06:58:23,320
Left!

8146
06:58:23,780 --> 06:58:24,520
Oh, nevermind.

8147
06:58:25,060 --> 06:58:26,220
You missed it, you missed it.

8148
06:58:29,040 --> 06:58:30,100
You missed it.

8149
06:58:30,140 --> 06:58:30,860
It's fine though.

8150
06:58:30,900 --> 06:58:31,340
It's cool.

8151
06:58:31,560 --> 06:58:32,400
Don't worry about it.

8152
06:58:32,780 --> 06:58:33,060
Right!

8153
06:58:36,760 --> 06:58:37,680
Lower right!

8154
06:58:38,380 --> 06:58:38,940
Down!

8155
06:58:39,200 --> 06:58:39,480
Left!

8156
06:58:39,560 --> 06:58:39,800
Right!

8157
06:58:39,800 --> 06:58:40,860
Right!

8158
06:58:41,400 --> 06:58:41,400
Right!

8159
06:58:41,940 --> 06:58:44,020
Oh my gosh, are we gonna miss it?

8160
06:58:44,260 --> 06:58:44,460
No!

8161
06:58:51,880 --> 06:58:52,560
Up!

8162
06:58:58,650 --> 06:58:59,550
Ok, nevermind.

8163
06:58:59,610 --> 06:59:00,070
That went to me.

8164
06:59:01,050 --> 06:59:01,330
Ok.

8165
06:59:02,370 --> 06:59:03,010
Right!

8166
06:59:04,030 --> 06:59:04,710
Nice.

8167
06:59:05,330 --> 06:59:05,670
Left!

8168
06:59:09,970 --> 06:59:10,650
Down!

8169
06:59:14,890 --> 06:59:15,530
Ok.

8170
06:59:15,850 --> 06:59:16,090
Up!

8171
06:59:16,650 --> 06:59:17,170
Up!

8172
06:59:17,710 --> 06:59:18,150
Left!

8173
06:59:22,330 --> 06:59:22,970
Wait!

8174
06:59:23,330 --> 06:59:24,170
Oh we got him!

8175
06:59:33,450 --> 06:59:35,390
My throat is so gone.

8176
06:59:35,550 --> 06:59:36,350
Oh gosh guys.

8177
06:59:39,290 --> 06:59:41,090
Sorry, I couldn't check chat at all.

8178
06:59:41,350 --> 06:59:42,870
Literally not even a single time.

8179
06:59:43,610 --> 06:59:44,530
Oh my gosh.

8180
06:59:47,170 --> 06:59:48,630
We did it!

8181
06:59:51,070 --> 06:59:52,390
We did it!

8182
06:59:52,430 --> 06:59:54,390
I almost did the load state, I'm not gonna lie.

8183
06:59:57,550 --> 06:59:58,790
It's me, the worm!

8184
07:00:22,630 --> 07:00:24,790
There's only the two of us left now.

8185
07:00:31,250 --> 07:00:33,550
Let me borrow your seat for a moment.

8186
07:00:33,910 --> 07:00:34,130
Ok.

8187
07:00:34,910 --> 07:00:37,190
Would she love you if you were a worm?

8188
07:00:38,190 --> 07:00:41,210
I have like pustules all over my body cause I'm poisoned.

8189
07:00:43,110 --> 07:00:44,510
It's still warm.

8190
07:00:45,170 --> 07:00:47,610
And sticky from your wormy body.

8191
07:00:53,230 --> 07:00:53,670
Ok.

8192
07:01:09,630 --> 07:01:10,170
What's wrong?

8193
07:01:10,690 --> 07:01:11,130
What?

8194
07:01:11,590 --> 07:01:12,370
You did that.

8195
07:01:12,470 --> 07:01:13,350
What are we waiting for?

8196
07:01:16,110 --> 07:01:16,930
What is it?

8197
07:01:18,550 --> 07:01:18,770
Yeah?

8198
07:01:19,650 --> 07:01:20,570
What is it?

8199
07:01:21,850 --> 07:01:22,690
Oh no!

8200
07:01:26,670 --> 07:01:28,730
Ok, you can do it yourself then.

8201
07:01:28,810 --> 07:01:29,950
Oh, escape hatch.

8202
07:01:30,870 --> 07:01:32,030
Security level A.

8203
07:01:32,690 --> 07:01:32,990
Open!

8204
07:01:33,590 --> 07:01:34,070
Oh, open.

8205
07:01:34,570 --> 07:01:35,250
Oh, she's doing it.

8206
07:01:36,330 --> 07:01:37,570
It's not me this time.

8207
07:01:38,830 --> 07:01:39,430
Password.

8208
07:01:39,850 --> 07:01:41,370
My frigid heart.

8209
07:01:42,090 --> 07:01:44,730
The only thing that melts it is...

8210
07:01:44,730 --> 07:01:46,570
just your...

8211
07:01:52,590 --> 07:01:55,730
Please operator, I need your help one last time.

8212
07:01:55,890 --> 07:01:58,170
Please tell me the password to the escape hatch.

8213
07:01:58,350 --> 07:01:59,030
Is it worm?

8214
07:02:03,190 --> 07:02:04,710
I don't know.

8215
07:02:04,870 --> 07:02:05,210
Hold on.

8216
07:02:05,370 --> 07:02:05,730
Sorry.

8217
07:02:06,330 --> 07:02:07,970
I'm checking game facts right now.

8218
07:02:08,910 --> 07:02:11,070
The one thing that melts it is your worm.

8219
07:02:20,320 --> 07:02:21,240
What is it?

8220
07:02:22,660 --> 07:02:23,340
Worm.

8221
07:02:29,440 --> 07:02:30,680
No, I said worm.

8222
07:02:35,940 --> 07:02:36,620
Mint.

8223
07:02:38,160 --> 07:02:39,740
Touch, that's five letters.

8224
07:02:39,920 --> 07:02:40,460
Worm!

8225
07:02:41,540 --> 07:02:42,220
Oh!

8226
07:02:42,680 --> 07:02:43,260
Love.

8227
07:02:45,000 --> 07:02:47,060
The only thing that melts it is...

8228
07:02:47,060 --> 07:02:49,300
just your love.

8229
07:02:49,420 --> 07:02:50,680
Ok, got it.

8230
07:02:52,840 --> 07:02:55,040
Not the mic change.

8231
07:02:57,440 --> 07:02:58,520
Your hate.

8232
07:03:00,580 --> 07:03:01,940
It's your love!

8233
07:03:04,780 --> 07:03:05,500
Bye!

8234
07:03:19,240 --> 07:03:21,220
Guess what we have here.

8235
07:03:22,900 --> 07:03:24,500
It's some leaves.

8236
07:03:24,960 --> 07:03:27,380
Some leaves that I got my child.

8237
07:03:42,940 --> 07:03:43,580
Sir!

8238
07:03:48,810 --> 07:03:49,750
This way!

8239
07:03:50,450 --> 07:03:50,790
Oh, sorry.

8240
07:03:50,870 --> 07:03:51,590
I forgot to turn it off.

8241
07:03:53,050 --> 07:03:53,870
What happened?

8242
07:03:56,290 --> 07:03:56,770
Oh!

8243
07:04:00,950 --> 07:04:01,910
Get out!

8244
07:04:07,210 --> 07:04:10,250
I think at this point there is like...

8245
07:04:10,250 --> 07:04:11,790
space coming in.

8246
07:04:12,030 --> 07:04:14,450
There is like non-oxygen in the spaceship.

8247
07:04:17,350 --> 07:04:18,670
Take a deep breath!

8248
07:04:20,710 --> 07:04:21,670
Mission accomplished.

8249
07:04:22,890 --> 07:04:24,470
Oh, I thought that was me for a second.

8250
07:04:24,530 --> 07:04:25,670
I was about to be like, I'm hot!

8251
07:04:31,600 --> 07:04:32,420
Holy shit!

8252
07:04:32,880 --> 07:04:33,840
That's me!

8253
07:04:38,360 --> 07:04:40,540
I'm the ultimate self insert character.

8254
07:04:40,640 --> 07:04:43,340
They won't even let me see a little bit of my body.

8255
07:04:48,650 --> 07:04:49,710
I'm a self insert!

8256
07:04:50,350 --> 07:04:51,230
Bye dad.

8257
07:04:57,410 --> 07:04:58,410
I'm a worm.

8258
07:04:59,210 --> 07:05:00,410
I'm not a worm.

8259
07:05:08,040 --> 07:05:08,860
Our girlfriend!

8260
07:05:09,780 --> 07:05:12,040
She was so...

8261
07:05:13,820 --> 07:05:15,520
She was so cute.

8262
07:05:17,900 --> 07:05:22,300
Not gonna lie, she did kind of look like Metal Gear Naomi, but...

8263
07:05:22,300 --> 07:05:23,080
We forgive her.

8264
07:05:36,720 --> 07:05:38,340
We did it!

8265
07:05:45,550 --> 07:05:47,150
The GIF explosions.

8266
07:05:56,650 --> 07:05:58,590
What do you mean one last thing?

8267
07:05:58,890 --> 07:05:59,830
Are we not gonna talk more?

8268
07:06:03,950 --> 07:06:08,010
I look like

8269
07:06:12,830 --> 07:06:14,690
a Roblox character from behind.

8270
07:06:18,890 --> 07:06:20,070
No way!

8271
07:06:25,630 --> 07:06:26,370
Space.

8272
07:06:34,990 --> 07:06:36,510
This is so beautiful.

8273
07:06:36,510 --> 07:06:38,150
Oh my god!

8274
07:06:38,410 --> 07:06:41,390
Those didn't dissolve in the explosion?

8275
07:06:41,990 --> 07:06:42,710
That's not good.

8276
07:06:43,630 --> 07:06:44,810
She never learned your name.

8277
07:06:44,870 --> 07:06:45,890
She really didn't.

8278
07:06:52,630 --> 07:06:54,310
Were they planning on a sequel?

8279
07:06:56,270 --> 07:06:56,890
I wonder.

8280
07:06:57,070 --> 07:06:59,270
What is this like Final Fantasy-esque music?

8281
07:07:03,960 --> 07:07:05,160
I like it though.

8282
07:07:12,050 --> 07:07:14,390
Everybody died, except us.

8283
07:07:23,950 --> 07:07:26,180
We completed Lifeline!

8284
07:07:26,740 --> 07:07:27,940
I said I would do it today.

8285
07:07:35,000 --> 07:07:36,880
We did it!

8286
07:07:37,750 --> 07:07:39,560
Two survivors out of 50.

8287
07:07:40,480 --> 07:07:42,080
She was awesome!

8288
07:07:42,760 --> 07:07:44,440
Wait, no that's the reporter.

8289
07:07:44,560 --> 07:07:44,900
Just kidding.

8290
07:07:45,200 --> 07:07:47,180
No, the wife of the Prime Minister.

8291
07:07:47,920 --> 07:07:48,800
Love that lady.

8292
07:07:48,900 --> 07:07:49,660
She was great.

8293
07:07:52,820 --> 07:07:57,160
There are so many characters that just like were there and then faded out of existence.

8294
07:08:02,440 --> 07:08:03,560
Like Gino.

8295
07:08:04,980 --> 07:08:07,360
Gino was supposed to be our love interest.

8296
07:08:07,480 --> 07:08:08,600
Revolver Ocelot.

8297
07:08:08,600 --> 07:08:11,100
Time for New Game Plus with the new outfits.

8298
07:08:12,420 --> 07:08:14,840
I am curious to see what the outfit looks like.

8299
07:08:15,220 --> 07:08:17,340
Do I start off with the outfit?

8300
07:08:24,290 --> 07:08:28,810
We gave Gino brain damage, so he might have not survived anyway.

8301
07:08:30,390 --> 07:08:32,130
Do a speedrun of it.

8302
07:08:32,450 --> 07:08:36,430
I want to know what is the world record for this game.

8303
07:08:36,710 --> 07:08:37,290
I'm going to look it up.

8304
07:08:39,270 --> 07:08:44,010
I apologize for using the save state in the final boss, you guys.

8305
07:08:44,230 --> 07:08:44,810
I apologize.

8306
07:08:46,330 --> 07:08:51,090
Good job for pushing through and having the restraint of not using save state until the very last moment just to skip the cutscenes.

8307
07:08:53,410 --> 07:08:56,030
I honestly just wanted to save time for all of us.

8308
07:08:56,310 --> 07:08:58,230
I don't want to waste your time.

8309
07:09:07,080 --> 07:09:08,800
Congrats on beating your 7th game.

8310
07:09:08,900 --> 07:09:11,080
I think this year you are stronger than me for sure.

8311
07:09:11,200 --> 07:09:12,460
I would have not been able to complete this.

8312
07:09:12,940 --> 07:09:14,480
Good gaming and perseverance, Mindo.

8313
07:09:14,680 --> 07:09:15,320
Thank you!

8314
07:09:18,740 --> 07:09:20,300
You didn't use it for gameplay purposes.

8315
07:09:20,460 --> 07:09:20,840
It's cool.

8316
07:09:21,400 --> 07:09:22,220
Okay, thank you.

8317
07:09:22,420 --> 07:09:23,280
Thanks for understanding.

8318
07:09:24,660 --> 07:09:27,160
I don't like... Well, you know, I've used him before.

8319
07:09:28,660 --> 07:09:29,020
Like...

8320
07:09:29,720 --> 07:09:31,720
Oh my god, at an angle she looks like Raiden.

8321
07:09:31,720 --> 07:09:33,400
Congrats on beating the game.

8322
07:09:34,240 --> 07:09:38,140
Which was more frustrating to play, this or Yomawari's final boss.

8323
07:09:39,040 --> 07:09:41,800
I feel like I should... Well, I don't know.

8324
07:09:42,000 --> 07:09:48,020
I feel like I should go through Yomawari again and see how much of a gamer I've become.

8325
07:09:48,140 --> 07:09:50,820
But, this is the most frustrating thing about this game.

8326
07:09:51,500 --> 07:09:55,820
Usually with games, I can feel like...

8327
07:09:55,820 --> 07:09:57,900
Yeah, I...

8328
07:09:57,900 --> 07:09:59,180
Even if a part...

8329
07:09:59,600 --> 07:10:00,680
Operator is me!

8330
07:10:04,740 --> 07:10:11,120
But I can feel like even if I get through a difficult part of a game, I am honing my skills as a gamer.

8331
07:10:11,760 --> 07:10:14,940
With this, I don't feel like I learned anything.

8332
07:10:17,440 --> 07:10:19,800
I truly don't feel like I...

8333
07:10:21,880 --> 07:10:26,660
I didn't... I didn't gain any sort of knowledge or skill from this game.

8334
07:10:27,520 --> 07:10:31,680
Speedruns between 2 and a half hours at number 1 and 3 hours at number 7.

8335
07:10:32,980 --> 07:10:35,280
Upload your run to be number 9?

8336
07:10:35,940 --> 07:10:37,180
That's not bad.

8337
07:10:37,840 --> 07:10:39,460
Hayden, thank you for the 5 gifted.

8338
07:10:39,980 --> 07:10:42,040
Chidoto, welcome back.

8339
07:10:42,440 --> 07:10:43,920
Never a waste of time with you, Minto.

8340
07:10:45,900 --> 07:10:47,940
Chocolate fudge face, thank you for the super chat.

8341
07:10:47,940 --> 07:10:51,840
If only they'd known the stone would have sown such lethal evil in people.

8342
07:10:52,120 --> 07:10:53,280
If only, right?

8343
07:10:54,140 --> 07:10:56,160
And you know what's also so frustrating?

8344
07:10:57,200 --> 07:10:59,420
We didn't need that final heal.

8345
07:11:01,820 --> 07:11:03,580
We didn't even need it.

8346
07:11:05,580 --> 07:11:06,920
We didn't even need it.

8347
07:11:11,700 --> 07:11:14,940
Is the bosses... Wait, this boss...

8348
07:11:15,960 --> 07:11:17,820
VA's Chad Virgil... Wait, really?

8349
07:11:18,480 --> 07:11:19,840
You became a master tongue twister.

8350
07:11:19,940 --> 07:11:20,600
That's true?

8351
07:11:21,440 --> 07:11:23,300
That is very true.

8352
07:11:32,700 --> 07:11:34,880
Why did it have that heal at the end?

8353
07:11:34,980 --> 07:11:35,340
Right!

8354
07:11:36,800 --> 07:11:37,280
Strange.

8355
07:11:37,800 --> 07:11:38,680
Thanks for the ping!

8356
07:11:40,260 --> 07:11:43,140
Congrats on beating one of the most frustrating games I've ever seen.

8357
07:11:43,240 --> 07:11:45,800
The craziness in the last 2 hours almost made up for the suffering.

8358
07:11:45,920 --> 07:11:46,700
God gamer Minto.

8359
07:11:46,700 --> 07:11:51,360
The story was pretty wild.

8360
07:11:51,460 --> 07:11:52,280
I liked that.

8361
07:11:52,800 --> 07:11:56,780
I did not expect a philosopher's stone and then for...

8362
07:11:59,440 --> 07:12:00,900
All that happened.

8363
07:12:03,660 --> 07:12:04,740
So fun.

8364
07:12:05,340 --> 07:12:06,380
It got pretty bonkers.

8365
07:12:06,520 --> 07:12:09,020
The brain...

8366
07:12:09,020 --> 07:12:10,680
I'm gonna die if you don't think of something quick!

8367
07:12:10,920 --> 07:12:11,560
I'm gonna die!

8368
07:12:11,940 --> 07:12:13,160
One last remix!

8369
07:12:19,620 --> 07:12:20,480
Test it!

8370
07:12:27,620 --> 07:12:31,440
Second game you've completed this month involving a stone?

8371
07:12:33,240 --> 07:12:34,120
Sonic?

8372
07:12:43,110 --> 07:12:44,070
Oh,

8373
07:12:48,850 --> 07:12:49,590
Indiana Jones!

8374
07:12:53,430 --> 07:12:56,530
Think of something quick!

8375
07:12:56,650 --> 07:12:56,930
Quick!

8376
07:12:57,010 --> 07:12:57,250
Quick!

8377
07:12:57,430 --> 07:12:57,730
Quick!

8378
07:12:57,970 --> 07:12:58,850
Number 2!

8379
07:12:58,990 --> 07:12:59,470
Number 2!

8380
07:12:59,850 --> 07:13:00,690
In her mouth, Rio!

8381
07:13:01,690 --> 07:13:02,890
Dodge, right, Rio!

8382
07:13:02,990 --> 07:13:03,570
Number 2!

8383
07:13:03,830 --> 07:13:04,990
In her mouth!

8384
07:13:06,830 --> 07:13:08,450
In her mouth!

8385
07:13:13,640 --> 07:13:14,440
Dodge, Rio!

8386
07:13:14,580 --> 07:13:15,320
Dodge, Rio!

8387
07:13:15,440 --> 07:13:16,060
Number 2!

8388
07:13:16,320 --> 07:13:17,240
In her mouth!

8389
07:13:27,820 --> 07:13:28,040
Quick!

8390
07:13:28,320 --> 07:13:28,980
Rest in glitch face.

8391
07:13:29,100 --> 07:13:30,100
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

8392
07:13:30,580 --> 07:13:31,140
Let's see.

8393
07:13:32,060 --> 07:13:32,600
I'll try.

8394
07:13:32,700 --> 07:13:33,080
I'll try.

8395
07:13:33,080 --> 07:13:33,920
Load game.

8396
07:13:35,360 --> 07:13:36,460
New game plus.

8397
07:13:36,640 --> 07:13:38,100
I'll see the sexy outfit.

8398
07:13:38,320 --> 07:13:41,120
I'm obviously not gonna wait for the second, second sexy outfit.

8399
07:13:41,300 --> 07:13:43,320
Because that's way far in the game.

8400
07:13:43,700 --> 07:13:46,080
But we will see her...

8401
07:13:48,680 --> 07:13:50,160
Her sexy outfit.

8402
07:13:51,540 --> 07:13:52,740
For you guys.

8403
07:13:53,700 --> 07:13:55,880
We'll see her sexy outfit for you guys.

8404
07:13:56,280 --> 07:13:58,060
I am a ghost of the people.

8405
07:14:01,660 --> 07:14:02,900
We can look it up.

8406
07:14:02,960 --> 07:14:06,420
Surprisingly, it was hard for me to find screenshots of this game.

8407
07:14:06,640 --> 07:14:08,620
To use for like backgrounds and stuff.

8408
07:14:09,540 --> 07:14:10,340
Just image search.

8409
07:14:10,700 --> 07:14:10,700
Second.

8410
07:14:13,780 --> 07:14:13,940
Ok, hold on.

8411
07:14:14,420 --> 07:14:15,300
Can I skip this?

8412
07:14:16,760 --> 07:14:17,320
L1.

8413
07:14:20,540 --> 07:14:21,020
Oh wait!

8414
07:14:22,460 --> 07:14:24,060
We get like new...

8415
07:14:26,560 --> 07:14:28,620
We get new context.

8416
07:14:29,580 --> 07:14:32,540
They did talk about this at the beginning.

8417
07:14:39,620 --> 07:14:42,060
And all the stuff...

8418
07:14:47,720 --> 07:14:51,140
Is this from the...

8419
07:14:57,660 --> 07:15:01,000
I completely forgot about this at the beginning.

8420
07:15:11,750 --> 07:15:13,110
Googling sexy outfit.

8421
07:15:16,610 --> 07:15:18,350
I don't get like anything.

8422
07:15:20,670 --> 07:15:21,430
Sucks.

8423
07:15:24,590 --> 07:15:26,890
I only see her waitress outfit.

8424
07:15:42,030 --> 07:15:45,490
Guys, I have people messaging me for collabs.

8425
07:15:45,590 --> 07:15:51,150
I'm playing a nostalgic game.

8426
07:15:52,270 --> 07:15:53,950
I just finished it.

8427
07:15:54,830 --> 07:15:55,690
I cleared it.

8428
07:16:02,350 --> 07:16:04,470
Our popular ghost.

8429
07:16:06,130 --> 07:16:07,050
Popular.

8430
07:16:09,830 --> 07:16:12,550
Lifeline outfits PS2 got some image.

8431
07:16:12,610 --> 07:16:12,950
Oh really?

8432
07:16:13,130 --> 07:16:13,250
Wait!

8433
07:16:13,330 --> 07:16:13,810
Don't spoil!

8434
07:16:14,010 --> 07:16:14,510
Don't spoil!

8435
07:16:14,590 --> 07:16:15,390
Don't spoil for you!

8436
07:16:16,150 --> 07:16:16,830
Lifeline.

8437
07:16:18,550 --> 07:16:19,570
Don't spoil.

8438
07:16:21,490 --> 07:16:23,350
Don't spoil for yourself.

8439
07:16:25,430 --> 07:16:27,910
I keep getting Lifeline from Apex.

8440
07:16:30,810 --> 07:16:32,470
I see it.

8441
07:16:37,870 --> 07:16:40,290
New game plus Gustav's room final boss.

8442
07:16:40,370 --> 07:16:43,430
I suffered with that more than I did anything else in this game.

8443
07:16:46,950 --> 07:16:48,790
What's wrong with me?

8444
07:16:49,430 --> 07:16:52,970
Why do I have such a yearning for dirt?

8445
07:16:57,790 --> 07:17:00,310
I want to eat dirt.

8446
07:17:05,670 --> 07:17:06,270
Dirt.

8447
07:17:06,550 --> 07:17:08,030
Dirt because I'm a worm?

8448
07:17:08,030 --> 07:17:09,690
I want to eat dirt.

8449
07:17:10,390 --> 07:17:11,770
Oh, thanks for the food.

8450
07:17:12,030 --> 07:17:14,630
Gosh, I'm a worm right now.

8451
07:17:15,070 --> 07:17:16,390
I'm a worm.

8452
07:17:21,990 --> 07:17:23,110
Our wound.

8453
07:17:23,270 --> 07:17:24,930
Wait, what about the poison?

8454
07:17:25,950 --> 07:17:27,690
Do we get healed or...

8455
07:17:29,390 --> 07:17:30,710
Thanks for the rain.

8456
07:17:31,550 --> 07:17:32,330
I'm a worm.

8457
07:17:32,390 --> 07:17:33,650
I want to eat dirt.

8458
07:17:33,650 --> 07:17:33,750
Dirt.

8459
07:17:37,030 --> 07:17:39,070
Wait, do we see her walking around?

8460
07:17:41,450 --> 07:17:42,850
Bark like a dog.

8461
07:17:44,130 --> 07:17:46,290
This is the opening party a little while ago.

8462
07:17:47,830 --> 07:17:52,330
No, I see that person in their regular waitress outfit.

8463
07:17:55,270 --> 07:17:56,230
Murphy, thanks for the baguette.

8464
07:17:59,130 --> 07:17:59,610
Baguette.

8465
07:18:02,050 --> 07:18:03,810
Sure see, thank you for the baguette.

8466
07:18:04,450 --> 07:18:06,790
We were lucky to be invited to the space station hotel.

8467
07:18:07,130 --> 07:18:07,990
Why were we there?

8468
07:18:08,830 --> 07:18:09,630
Our girlfriend.

8469
07:18:11,710 --> 07:18:13,410
Oh, that's not a sexy outfit.

8470
07:18:14,670 --> 07:18:16,990
I mean, yes, but it's not the sexiest.

8471
07:18:16,990 --> 07:18:18,430
It's not a new sex...

8472
07:18:21,450 --> 07:18:22,390
Girlfriend Naomi.

8473
07:18:23,630 --> 07:18:24,730
StarCreator, thanks for the baguette.

8474
07:18:25,970 --> 07:18:26,350
Naomi.

8475
07:18:28,990 --> 07:18:30,330
Cashew, thank you for the baguette.

8476
07:18:30,930 --> 07:18:31,810
Thank you so much.

8477
07:18:31,870 --> 07:18:32,810
I hope you had a good stream.

8478
07:18:36,170 --> 07:18:37,330
Jay, thank you for the baguette.

8479
07:18:37,790 --> 07:18:39,970
We're just going through the... We just beat the game.

8480
07:18:40,330 --> 07:18:45,670
We're just going through the beginning again because you get a new game plus outfit.

8481
07:18:45,850 --> 07:18:46,390
That's sex?

8482
07:18:54,930 --> 07:18:56,010
What are those?

8483
07:18:56,790 --> 07:18:59,650
We definitely did not have to fight anything like that.

8484
07:18:59,830 --> 07:19:00,570
Thank god.

8485
07:19:04,270 --> 07:19:05,710
Oh, just kidding.

8486
07:19:05,910 --> 07:19:06,370
Yeah, we did.

8487
07:19:06,730 --> 07:19:07,930
Yeah, we fought that.

8488
07:19:08,350 --> 07:19:08,770
Nevermind.

8489
07:19:10,050 --> 07:19:11,130
Oh, we fought that.

8490
07:19:13,090 --> 07:19:13,770
Yeah.

8491
07:19:14,650 --> 07:19:15,930
Shoot it in the middle eye!

8492
07:19:16,570 --> 07:19:17,470
Left eye!

8493
07:19:17,810 --> 07:19:18,390
Right eye!

8494
07:19:18,810 --> 07:19:19,730
Middle eye!

8495
07:19:20,410 --> 07:19:21,150
Red eye!

8496
07:19:21,810 --> 07:19:26,570
I'm going to be hearing these comments for like a millennia.

8497
07:19:26,870 --> 07:19:28,290
I'm never going to forget.

8498
07:19:29,230 --> 07:19:29,970
In her mouth!

8499
07:19:30,890 --> 07:19:31,630
I'd rather not!

8500
07:19:31,770 --> 07:19:32,450
Thanks for the five gifted.

8501
07:19:32,970 --> 07:19:33,930
I passed out.

8502
07:19:34,090 --> 07:19:37,010
I can't believe we're spending Christmas in space.

8503
07:19:38,810 --> 07:19:39,690
Thank you.

8504
07:19:40,070 --> 07:19:43,390
I can't believe we're spending Christmas in space.

8505
07:19:43,670 --> 07:19:46,070
Guys, this year should we spend Christmas in space?

8506
07:19:46,690 --> 07:19:49,190
My beloved girlfriend...

8507
07:19:51,710 --> 07:19:53,410
Last time we'll see her.

8508
07:19:54,910 --> 07:19:57,610
Yeah, what do you do for Christmas in space?

8509
07:20:01,250 --> 07:20:03,150
Yeah, this was a Christmas... Wait.

8510
07:20:06,230 --> 07:20:07,370
Where's your new outfit?

8511
07:20:07,370 --> 07:20:07,470
What?

8512
07:20:14,130 --> 07:20:16,350
Oh my God!

8513
07:20:16,690 --> 07:20:18,910
Got the tattoo.

8514
07:20:19,530 --> 07:20:20,570
Oh my God!

8515
07:20:20,990 --> 07:20:21,870
Oh my God!

8516
07:20:29,870 --> 07:20:30,750
Sex?

8517
07:20:39,610 --> 07:20:40,610
No!

8518
07:20:46,210 --> 07:20:48,510
I got you.

8519
07:20:49,210 --> 07:20:50,690
God damn!

8520
07:20:51,030 --> 07:20:51,350
Mario!

8521
07:20:54,390 --> 07:20:56,450
Does she still have her commands?

8522
07:20:58,410 --> 07:21:00,590
Does she still have her old commands?

8523
07:21:03,850 --> 07:21:05,590
Holy moly!

8524
07:21:10,750 --> 07:21:13,090
Are you trapped inside that monitor room?

8525
07:21:13,690 --> 07:21:15,350
So we share the same dilemma.

8526
07:21:16,990 --> 07:21:19,150
I want to know what the other outfit is.

8527
07:21:19,730 --> 07:21:20,930
First there's something I have to get.

8528
07:21:23,370 --> 07:21:25,210
What is the other outfit?

8529
07:21:26,250 --> 07:21:27,850
She's got her grippers on display.

8530
07:21:28,290 --> 07:21:30,070
This is too much!

8531
07:21:30,730 --> 07:21:32,030
This is too much!

8532
07:21:33,410 --> 07:21:36,070
The tattoo is also way too much.

8533
07:21:38,150 --> 07:21:39,370
The rose tattoo?

8534
07:21:39,470 --> 07:21:40,210
What is she, a biker?

8535
07:21:47,560 --> 07:21:48,700
The single glove.

8536
07:21:54,000 --> 07:21:55,660
I want to know what the other outfit is.

8537
07:21:55,740 --> 07:21:56,620
I have space trauma.

8538
07:21:56,880 --> 07:21:58,480
My oshi left us to travel the stars.

8539
07:21:59,300 --> 07:21:59,920
Oh no!

8540
07:22:01,960 --> 07:22:03,360
Other outfit is more beamed.

8541
07:22:03,560 --> 07:22:04,480
Yes, I'm beamed!

8542
07:22:05,640 --> 07:22:06,760
How can I find it?

8543
07:22:06,760 --> 07:22:07,880
I want to show you guys.

8544
07:22:10,980 --> 07:22:12,560
I want to find it.

8545
07:22:15,160 --> 07:22:16,800
That's her shooting glove.

8546
07:22:19,420 --> 07:22:19,820
Lifeline.

8547
07:22:21,900 --> 07:22:22,700
PS2 outfit.

8548
07:22:25,920 --> 07:22:26,320
Oh!

8549
07:22:26,560 --> 07:22:26,900
Wait!

8550
07:22:26,980 --> 07:22:27,120
Wait!

8551
07:22:27,220 --> 07:22:27,360
Wait!

8552
07:22:27,420 --> 07:22:27,560
Wait!

8553
07:22:27,640 --> 07:22:27,800
Wait!

8554
07:22:28,160 --> 07:22:30,020
I think I see a little bit of it.

8555
07:22:32,360 --> 07:22:32,960
Hold on.

8556
07:22:33,020 --> 07:22:33,300
Hold on.

8557
07:22:33,320 --> 07:22:34,000
I'll save this picture.

8558
07:22:37,260 --> 07:22:37,860
Welcome!

8559
07:22:40,400 --> 07:22:42,840
I'm trying to see if I can find a better picture.

8560
07:22:44,920 --> 07:22:45,900
Scanning the internet.

8561
07:22:46,520 --> 07:22:48,140
I'm hacking the hard drives.

8562
07:22:49,080 --> 07:22:49,740
Look at this.

8563
07:22:50,980 --> 07:22:52,340
This is the...

8564
07:22:52,340 --> 07:22:56,780
I can't

8565
07:23:13,220 --> 07:23:13,780
do this anymore.

8566
07:23:14,960 --> 07:23:16,680
I don't want to...

8567
07:23:18,940 --> 07:23:19,600
No, no.

8568
07:23:19,880 --> 07:23:20,400
That's it.

8569
07:23:20,440 --> 07:23:21,180
That's it for that.

8570
07:23:21,340 --> 07:23:22,900
No, we're not playing the game again.

8571
07:23:23,140 --> 07:23:24,480
We're not playing the game again.

8572
07:23:24,640 --> 07:23:25,820
Wait, but the sexy pose.

8573
07:23:25,960 --> 07:23:27,840
Okay, we must figure out if she can do a sexy pose.

8574
07:23:30,120 --> 07:23:30,800
Right eye.

8575
07:23:31,840 --> 07:23:32,580
Middle eye.

8576
07:23:33,560 --> 07:23:34,240
Left eye.

8577
07:23:36,180 --> 07:23:37,320
Never change real.

8578
07:23:37,680 --> 07:23:38,320
Left eye.

8579
07:23:39,680 --> 07:23:40,400
Red eye.

8580
07:23:55,190 --> 07:23:56,910
I found a YouTube title.

8581
07:23:57,110 --> 07:23:59,910
Lifeline PS2 part 26 bonus.

8582
07:24:01,630 --> 07:24:02,410
No way.

8583
07:24:04,750 --> 07:24:05,690
Yeah, I know.

8584
07:24:06,010 --> 07:24:07,230
She got the pink toes.

8585
07:24:07,930 --> 07:24:08,990
And your voice.

8586
07:24:09,990 --> 07:24:10,830
I remember now.

8587
07:24:11,350 --> 07:24:12,170
You were at the party.

8588
07:24:13,090 --> 07:24:14,490
I think you were the youngest couple there.

8589
07:24:16,170 --> 07:24:16,810
Weren't you?

8590
07:24:17,750 --> 07:24:20,030
You were with the girl in the dark blue dress.

8591
07:24:20,470 --> 07:24:23,290
Can't read, can't aim, no sense of direction, never change real.

8592
07:24:23,650 --> 07:24:24,270
What was her name?

8593
07:24:25,470 --> 07:24:27,090
Oh, what was her name?

8594
07:24:28,350 --> 07:24:29,630
What was her name, you guys?

8595
07:24:31,010 --> 07:24:31,630
Joe Mama.

8596
07:24:32,070 --> 07:24:32,890
That can't be true.

8597
07:24:33,370 --> 07:24:35,010
What's your girlfriend's name?

8598
07:24:35,010 --> 07:24:36,470
Your mom.

8599
07:24:49,270 --> 07:24:50,010
Minky.

8600
07:24:52,670 --> 07:24:54,150
Brand new look, same great real.

8601
07:24:55,210 --> 07:24:55,990
She was polite.

8602
07:24:57,190 --> 07:24:59,370
I said Nimi Nightmare before.

8603
07:25:00,630 --> 07:25:01,650
Naked Snake.

8604
07:25:02,270 --> 07:25:02,590
Vicky.

8605
07:25:07,330 --> 07:25:08,020
Amy.

8606
07:25:09,010 --> 07:25:10,680
The Hedgehog.

8607
07:25:11,870 --> 07:25:13,250
Kiara.

8608
07:25:17,030 --> 07:25:18,190
Rio.

8609
07:25:22,690 --> 07:25:26,890
How do you know it?

8610
07:25:27,350 --> 07:25:28,030
Say Kristen.

8611
07:25:28,450 --> 07:25:28,850
Kristen.

8612
07:25:36,010 --> 07:25:37,650
Is that like her voice actress's name?

8613
07:25:38,330 --> 07:25:39,550
Is that her voice actress's name?

8614
07:25:40,790 --> 07:25:44,130
Ever since Phantom Thief you became my OCN, I'm a big fan.

8615
07:25:44,590 --> 07:25:49,030
I want to announce to you that my family is having another whisp of the Phantom House.

8616
07:25:49,390 --> 07:25:51,250
I'm going to be a brother for a seventh time.

8617
07:25:51,650 --> 07:25:52,690
That's a full house.

8618
07:25:52,850 --> 07:25:54,670
Thank you so much.

8619
07:25:54,890 --> 07:25:56,170
Thank you for the super chat.

8620
07:25:56,610 --> 07:25:57,050
Congratulations.

8621
07:25:57,970 --> 07:25:58,810
Is that her VA's name?

8622
07:25:59,030 --> 07:25:59,470
Cool.

8623
07:25:59,970 --> 07:26:00,410
Elizabeth.

8624
07:26:00,410 --> 07:26:01,210
Amanda.

8625
07:26:02,010 --> 07:26:03,250
No, that's not it.

8626
07:26:03,550 --> 07:26:04,690
It was three syllables.

8627
07:26:05,590 --> 07:26:06,770
She's very polite.

8628
07:26:07,890 --> 07:26:08,610
What is her name?

8629
07:26:08,630 --> 07:26:16,090
Do you guys know that meme where it's a little girl and her mom is like, who are you playing with sweetie?

8630
07:26:16,390 --> 07:26:17,530
And she's like, Amanda.

8631
07:26:17,910 --> 07:26:21,370
And then it shows a grown ass man.

8632
07:26:21,630 --> 07:26:22,670
And the mom's like, oh!

8633
07:26:23,070 --> 07:26:26,210
And he goes, hi, I'm Amanda.

8634
07:26:26,670 --> 07:26:28,430
And I'm six.

8635
07:26:35,770 --> 07:26:37,530
That's how she says Amanda.

8636
07:26:37,810 --> 07:26:39,130
That's what it reminds me of.

8637
07:26:39,830 --> 07:26:40,370
Amanda.

8638
07:26:43,470 --> 07:26:44,450
Sexy pose.

8639
07:26:45,710 --> 07:26:45,930
No.

8640
07:26:46,130 --> 07:26:46,790
No, that's not it.

8641
07:26:47,290 --> 07:26:48,250
It was three syllables.

8642
07:26:49,290 --> 07:26:50,030
Three syllables.

8643
07:26:50,030 --> 07:26:51,110
What's the name of that girl?

8644
07:26:52,410 --> 07:26:53,370
Joe Mama.

8645
07:26:53,970 --> 07:26:54,510
Sharon.

8646
07:26:54,990 --> 07:26:56,150
No, that's not it.

8647
07:26:56,610 --> 07:26:57,450
It was three syllables.

8648
07:26:57,470 --> 07:26:58,630
How many names are in here?

8649
07:26:58,630 --> 07:27:00,110
Gustav.

8650
07:27:01,330 --> 07:27:02,070

8651
07:27:06,270 --> 07:27:07,770
Oh, you accepted the video.

8652
07:27:07,950 --> 07:27:08,610
Thank you.

8653
07:27:08,730 --> 07:27:09,390
Oh my gosh.

8654
07:27:11,890 --> 07:27:13,010
Okay, I give up.

8655
07:27:14,050 --> 07:27:14,550
Madonna.

8656
07:27:18,870 --> 07:27:19,390
Naomi.

8657
07:27:20,670 --> 07:27:20,970
What?

8658
07:27:25,510 --> 07:27:26,350
Naomi.

8659
07:27:31,030 --> 07:27:31,770
Oh yeah.

8660
07:27:31,970 --> 07:27:32,370
Yeah.

8661
07:27:39,550 --> 07:27:41,130
She's donezo, probably.

8662
07:27:41,250 --> 07:27:42,350
Thank you for the link!

8663
07:27:43,750 --> 07:27:44,090
Copy.

8664
07:27:49,790 --> 07:27:51,070
You might hear it real quick.

8665
07:27:51,190 --> 07:27:51,570
Sorry if you do.

8666
07:27:52,890 --> 07:27:53,610
Oh, what the hell?

8667
07:27:57,790 --> 07:27:58,850
Oh, copy link.

8668
07:27:59,010 --> 07:27:59,630
Oh man.

8669
07:28:02,170 --> 07:28:03,190
No.

8670
07:28:04,310 --> 07:28:07,190
I'll find your Naomi.

8671
07:28:12,280 --> 07:28:13,890
Is she talking to me?

8672
07:28:14,710 --> 07:28:15,730
Nah.

8673
07:28:23,650 --> 07:28:24,930
Where's the...

8674
07:28:24,930 --> 07:28:27,030
When did she change outfits?

8675
07:28:27,790 --> 07:28:28,570
Trying to find it.

8676
07:28:29,190 --> 07:28:30,490
Wait, did I find a good picture?

8677
07:28:30,870 --> 07:28:31,950
Oh, wow!

8678
07:28:32,310 --> 07:28:32,850
Okay, hold on.

8679
07:28:32,870 --> 07:28:33,550
I'll show you guys.

8680
07:28:37,810 --> 07:28:38,210
Okay.

8681
07:28:39,390 --> 07:28:41,690
Sorry, I just want to see if she can do the sexy pose.

8682
07:28:41,830 --> 07:28:42,970
I don't want to play anymore.

8683
07:28:44,470 --> 07:28:45,810
I don't want to play anymore!

8684
07:28:46,750 --> 07:28:48,710
I've played these games before!

8685
07:28:50,930 --> 07:28:52,270
Please let me be free!

8686
07:28:53,070 --> 07:28:54,170
What did she say?

8687
07:28:54,770 --> 07:28:55,090
Yeah.

8688
07:28:55,690 --> 07:28:56,750
I don't know what she asked me.

8689
07:28:59,350 --> 07:28:59,710
Okay.

8690
07:29:01,970 --> 07:29:04,930
I just want to see if you can sexy pose.

8691
07:29:29,310 --> 07:29:29,930
Okay.

8692
07:29:31,770 --> 07:29:32,570
Got it.

8693
07:29:33,030 --> 07:29:34,530
Stop yapping at me.

8694
07:29:37,670 --> 07:29:38,590
I will.

8695
07:29:38,750 --> 07:29:38,950
Oh my god.

8696
07:29:39,270 --> 07:29:39,890

07:29:50,030 --> 07:29:51,310

Okay, give me one second you guys.

8723
07:31:16,170 --> 07:31:30,650
Give me one second to pull up the YouTube and I'll show you guys a little bit of her other outfit.

8724
07:31:30,910 --> 07:31:32,230
Since we're not doing it.

8725
07:31:33,090 --> 07:31:35,170
Since I don't wanna.

8726
07:31:35,730 --> 07:31:37,290
You can't make me.

8727
07:31:37,470 --> 07:31:38,470
You can't make me.

8728
07:31:39,230 --> 07:31:41,590
Okay, I'll even keep the person's channel up.

8729
07:31:41,850 --> 07:31:44,670
You know, since I'm borrowing from them.

8730
07:31:45,110 --> 07:31:45,590
Okay.

8731
07:31:49,120 --> 07:31:50,540

8732
07:31:51,420 --> 07:31:52,580
Look at that.

8733
07:31:53,000 --> 07:31:54,380
Look at that.

8734
07:31:54,600 --> 07:31:55,260
Look at that.

8735
07:31:55,980 --> 07:31:57,120
Look at that.

8736
07:31:57,400 --> 07:32:01,180
Look, this video has less than 300 views.

8737
07:32:01,480 --> 07:32:03,040
Wait, it's only from a month ago.

8738
07:32:03,040 --> 07:32:05,000
Who was playing this in 20...

8739
07:32:05,000 --> 07:32:07,020
Well, I guess it kinda like popped off again, right?

8740
07:32:07,200 --> 07:32:07,500
Recently.

8741
07:32:11,280 --> 07:32:13,100
Wait, do we have to listen...

8742
07:32:13,100 --> 07:32:14,340
Do we hear this person's voice?

8743
07:32:15,520 --> 07:32:17,520
Oh wait, I don't really wanna hear their voice.

8744
07:32:19,840 --> 07:32:21,120
Damn, look at the pants!

8745
07:32:26,430 --> 07:32:27,590
Oh my god!

8746
07:32:28,530 --> 07:32:29,470

8747
07:32:32,510 --> 07:32:32,950
Okay.

8748
07:32:33,370 --> 07:32:33,930

8751
07:32:39,750 --> 07:32:44,190
Thank you guys for a fun adventure in space.

8752
07:32:45,470 --> 07:32:47,470
That was a little stressful.

8753
07:32:48,530 --> 07:32:49,750
But it was still fun.

8754
07:32:50,750 --> 07:32:52,190
And I hope you guys had fun too.

8755
07:32:53,470 --> 07:32:55,330
And I'm finally gonna go eat dinner.

8756
07:32:56,630 --> 07:32:58,330
But I've been...

8757
07:32:59,390 --> 07:33:01,250
I've been munching on corn.

8758
07:33:03,750 --> 07:33:04,470
So, yay!

8759
07:33:07,050 --> 07:33:07,410
