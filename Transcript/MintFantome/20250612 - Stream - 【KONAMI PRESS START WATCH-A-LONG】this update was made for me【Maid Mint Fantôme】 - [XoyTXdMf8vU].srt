1
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,120
I think I was moving something.

2
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,400
I think it accidentally hit the button that goes to... that goes to my gaming setup.

3
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,340
And I didn't notice.

4
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:52,650
I really only agreed to this stream because I was like, oh yeah, you know, every single day this week, I've woken up before or around 7 a.m.

5
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,310
my time.

6
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,430
So I was like, oh, I'll totally be fine.

7
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,590
The alarm went off.

8
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,210
I was like, oh, it's time.

9
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,090
There's also a leaf blower going around these parts.

10
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,170
He might be gone, actually.

11
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,970
Don't yon again, I'm gonna yon.

12
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,950
I can't help it.

13
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,400
But hopefully you don't hear them.

14
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,900
Good morning, everybody.

15
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,500
I hope this is way early for me, usually.

16
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,620
Oh, the music stopped.

17
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,280
Today is Konami Press Start, which is all about Metal Gear and Silent Hill.

18
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,440
Which, I'm very excited for both of those.

19
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,880
So I was like, well, I'll do a watch along of this because I'll be up anyway to watch it.

20
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:16,560
But also, I'm so annoyed that tomorrow they have a Metal Gear Hotline coming out.

21
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,880
So, why?

22
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,320
I will not be doing a watch along of the Metal Gear Hotline.

23
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,420
Watching from work.

24
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,020
Oh, thank you, guys.

25
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
If you're at work.

26
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,180
Or if you woke up early for this.

27
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,040
To watch with me.

28
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,840
Thank you.

29
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,480
Thank you.

30
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,140
What the heck is a hotline?

31
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,700
They've been doing them.

32
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,120
I actually...

33
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,860
I was actually complaining about it the other day.

34
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,360
I was just like, why'd they stop doing the hotlines?

35
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,380
They were just kind of like little updates and like addressing people's concerns.

36
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,380
Because a lot of people were like, Oh, I don't like that they're making Metal Gear without Kojima.

37
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,980
And I don't trust Konami.

38
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,060
And such and such and such.

39
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,680
They heard you complaining.

40
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,940
Yeah, and so they decided to...

41
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,880
You streamed one of them before, right?

42
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,180
I have.

44
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,640
So, then I was like, I'll...

45
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,300
I'll...

46
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,100
I will...

47
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,310
What was I saying?

48
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:36,910
Oh.

49
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,890
No, I don't know what I was saying.

50
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,690
I wish I could say I stayed up all night to watch with you.

51
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,690
But it was just a happy coincidence.

52
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,610
All night?

53
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,470
Oh my gosh.

54
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,250
Go to bed, please.

55
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,190
Watching Outwork, gang.

56
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,030
Thank you for EU Burnley's dream.

57
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,770
You can thank Konami.

58
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:01,870
It's not me.

59
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,170
More things into existence.

60
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,550
I guess so.

61
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,190
Hoping for any specific announcements.

62
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,750
I want to see if they talk about MGO and how it will work, mostly.

63
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,770
If there's any special things with that.

64
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,750
Oh my gosh.

65
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,350
In physical moods, thank you so much for the Tony Captain.

66
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,010
Thank you.

67
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,170
Thank you.

68
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,650
Thank you.

69
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:28,850
Brandon.

70
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,810
Thank you for 14 months.

71
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,990
Hope you are well.

72
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,250
I hope you are well.

73
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,610
You've been going through it, buddy.

74
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,050
Hopefully in the time that I was gone.

75
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,910
Things are better.

76
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,430
14 months.

77
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,170
Thank you.

78
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,590
Thank you.

79
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:51,810
Thank you.

80
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,170
Thank you.

81
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,190
Thank you.

82
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,150
Thank you.

83
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,430
We know what she's hoping to see.

84
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,250
You guys might be like, oh, we're going to get the crazy reactions from Mito.

85
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,810
No, but I'm so tired.

86
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,390
The one day that the sleepy gummies worked.

87
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,910
I didn't wake up even a little bit.

88
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,510
Usually my cats wake me up also at like 6 to feed them.

89
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,570
And I didn't wake up.

90
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,510
I...

91
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,450
I...

92
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,290
What's a sleepy gummy?

93
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,890
It's just a...

94
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,490
Melatonin...

95
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,150
Gummy.

96
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,630
That's all.

97
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,550
But uh...

98
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,370
Crazy reaction falls asleep.

99
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,410
Maybe if they don't stop...

100
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,650
Wait, what time does it start at?

101
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:47,850
Oh.

102
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,050
57.

103
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,030
We still have quite a bit of time.

104
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,610
MGS4 gets freed from PS3 soon.

105
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,870
I...

106
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,130
I...

107
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,410
I feel like they'll talk about that tomorrow.

108
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,750
Which makes me a little more upset that I'm doing the watch alone.

109
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,290
But this is also Silent Hill.

110
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,970
But I'm just like...

111
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,970
I want to do both, but...

112
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,790
Like tomorrow, there's a...

113
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,950
There's a Metal Gear Hotline.

114
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,490
Which...

115
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,510
Do they have a waiting room up yet for that?

116
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,890
Let me see.

117
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,030
Metal Gear Hotline.

118
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,690
Like why couldn't it be right after this?

119
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,890
Yeah, they started doing them...

120
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,410
Last year.

121
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,030
We'll be seeing you at this time.

122
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,650
Good morning.

123
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,830
Muhammad, welcome to Bubble Shop.

124
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,390
Thank you.

125
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,590
Been holding on to gifts since last year.

126
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,970
How does one drop them off to you at AX?

127
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,170
Matt...

128
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,330
I don't know how to tell you this, but...

129
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,170
I'm not gonna be at AX.

130
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,050
Like in...

131
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,130
I won't be there.

132
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,900
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,780
There will be a concert.

134
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,360
But I don't know if they're accepting gifts at it.

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,380
Especially because there's so many...

136
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,980
Other...

137
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,180
Talent as well.

138
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,400
So...

139
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,540
Kind of hard.

140
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,100
I've been waiting for that forever.

141
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,260
Gotta wait another year now.

142
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,280
No, no, no.

143
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,360
Shiro, welcome to membership.

144
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,540
Notorious B.S.J., welcome back.

145
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
Thank you so much for the five minutes.

146
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,780
Thank you.

147
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,120
Hold on.

148
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,920
I missed some super chats earlier.

149
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,660
Happy 14 months.

150
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,240
Thank you, Taki.

151
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,140
So...

152
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,900
What?

153
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh.

154
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,060
Oh, I'm scrolling.

155
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm scrolling.

156
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,580
Wait.

157
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,000
Night of Cups.

158
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,660
Silksong.

159
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,180
Yeah.

160
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,840
Silksong will get announced today.

161
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,500
Got called into work overtime this morning.

162
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
Oh, did you have...

163
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,360
Good luck with work!

164
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,020
Good.

165
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,220
Good luck!

166
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,430
I would say that off-kai is the best time to give me anything, but...

167
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,910
Unfortunately, I can't accept gifts that off-kai either.

168
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,270
I don't have, like, a...

169
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,110
P.O.

170
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,410
box or anything for people to send to.

171
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:50,770
I don't have a chance to...

172
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,250
Uhhh...

173
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,050
So...

174
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,050
Right now, it's kind of...

175
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,850
Difficult.

176
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:26,990
Uh... I'm sorry... Ayami did offer to take my stuff, but I told her that, um... I don't really have time to, like, check everything before... Because she said that they could take it and ship it for me, but I really... I don't really have time... Also,

177
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,030
it's gonna begin in, like, a minute, so... I don't really have time to, uh...

178
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,830
Like, kind of check in, make sure everything's good... Um... And also... Um...

179
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,130
Cash is the best gift now!

180
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,010
Uh...

181
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,830
Yeah, so it's kind of... It's kind of tricky...

182
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,710
Rumble Roses?

183
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,810
I haven't heard that in a long time, that game...

184
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,030
But yeah... So... I'm so sorry...

185
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,470
Let me turn off my music...

186
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,830
We have another countdown...

187
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,990
A countdown to countdown...

188
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,990
You ever feel disappointed...

189
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,390
Discovering Gray Fox's red glow-y thing...

190
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,090
Isn't his eye...

191
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,280
And his helmet's actual eyes are next to it...

192
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,450
No, I've never...

193
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,400
I've never been disappointed in Gray Fox ever...

194
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,420
Good morning, Gameboy!

195
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,440
Good morning, Gameboy!

196
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,100
Sucky, thank you so much for the 5GP...

197
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,380
I love it!

198
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,500
I love it!

199
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Oh, let me get smaller, too...

200
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,740
Before I forget...

201
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,530
I'll hang out...

202
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,370
With you guys over here...

203
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,330
Hang out with you guys over here...

204
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,300
Boy, boy, Mothman!

205
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,320
Where did you become extra boy?

206
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,900
Thank you so much for the 10-10!

207
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,440
Thank you!

208
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,040
Oh, okay...

209
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,920
I love...

210
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,160
Countdown...

211
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm ending the stream...

212
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,800
I can't...

213
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,460
I can't...

214
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,690
I'm gonna cut that out...

215
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,580
I'm gonna eat my own meal...

216
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,640
And pretend that...

217
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,700
I never...

218
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,580
I've never...

219
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,660
I was trying to say...

220
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,220
I love...

221
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,940
Countdowns!

222
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,960
But I'm tired...

223
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,420
I never say that word, ever...

224
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,170
No!

225
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,890
The Morning Bean Doge is so real!

226
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,930
Okay, it's starting!

227
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,710
It's starting!

228
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,130
It's the trailer...

229
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,770
Can I just show the trailer again?

230
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,350
A quiet wish...

231
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,270
To bring joy to someone...

232
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,550
Somewhere...

233
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,770
Wait, let me turn off the subtitle...

234
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,530
From that flame of passion...

235
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,570
Konami games are born...

236
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,950
Wait, is there an English subtitle?

237
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,210
There we go!

238
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,450
Oh, wow!

239
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,830
Oh, Konami Code!

240
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,380
My name is Noriyaki Okamura...

241
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,600
And I am the producer of the Metal Gear series...

242
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:00,620
That's...

243
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,460
The subtitle was wrong!

244
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,360
Today, we've prepared an extended version of our recent trailer...

245
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,220
With a few more new details...

246
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,280
Please take a look!

247
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,580
Okay!

248
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,960
I have that shirt!

249
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,880
It's in English!

250
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,060
Ocelot!

251
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,870
Where's Ocelot?

252
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,850
We're under fire!

253
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,330
We've seen all this, luckily...

254
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,250
We've seen all this, luckily...

255
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,530
Alright, Commander!

256
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,270
Alright, Commander!

257
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,890
Alright, Commander!

258
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,670
That's me!

259
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,970
That's me in the trees!

260
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,430
What's the matter?

261
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,370
I'm over here!

262
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,950
Come back to your own room!

263
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,650
Robin!

264
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,630
Yeah!

265
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,890
It was the Robin!

266
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:56,810
I'm over here!

267
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,700
I've seen some people...

268
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,000
Kind of complaining that these...

269
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,360
Trailers...

270
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,980
Are a little bit spoilery...

271
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,800
But at the same time...

272
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,120
I feel like if they didn't show anything...

273
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,340
People would be...

274
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,980
So upset...

275
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,760
I feel like they would be like...

276
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,660
Why aren't you showing...

277
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,040
Look at this big old grid!

278
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,160
I feel like if they...

279
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,160
Oh!

280
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
We actually get to see...

281
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,800
Snake vs.

282
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,600
Bomberman!

283
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,400
I'll be honest...

284
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,080
I forgot...

285
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,540
No shot!

286
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,120
We're there bringing back...

287
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,840
Secret Theater for real?!

288
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,240
Yeah!

289
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Them too!

290
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
But um...

291
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,460
Yeah, I feel like people will be like...

292
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,640
Oh!

293
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,340
You're not showing us anything of the game!

294
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,560
Any of the cutscenes!

295
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,280
It probably...

296
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,660
Sucks!

297
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,140
It's ugly!

298
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,980
And more...

299
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,060
I like the extended trailer was just...

300
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,560
Adding...

301
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,860
The...

302
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,960
The bomber...

303
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,660
Re-balance some things?

304
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,200
What does that mean?

305
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,620
Wait a second...

306
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,660
Of the ape escape crossover mode...

307
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,060
Snake vs.

308
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:28,680
Snake vs.

309
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,320
People monkey!

310
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,020
For the Xbox version...

311
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,480
We collaborated with another...

312
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,320
Konami series...

313
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,140
Bomberman...

314
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,020
To create...

315
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,520
Snake vs.

316
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,740
Bomberman...

317
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,860
Where you'll enter the jungle...

318
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,420
To chase down and blast away...

319
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,960
Bomberman...

320
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,700
Alongside...

321
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,040
Snake vs.

322
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,740
Monkey...

323
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,780
The much requested...

324
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,660
Secret Theater...

325
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,720
Also makes a return...

326
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,920
Oh my god...

327
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,080
Yes!

328
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,240
Secret Theater videos...

329
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,320
Will now be found as...

330
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,140
Collectors in games...

331
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,140
In addition...

332
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,920
There are also...

333
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,620
All new...

334
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,260
Secret Theater videos...

335
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,460
Metal Gear Solid...

336
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,500
Delta...

337
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,280
Snake Eater...

338
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,080
They'll be secretly...

339
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,140
Carried by enemy soldiers...

340
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,900
So try to track...

341
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,680
Shut up...

342
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
The sneaking DLC pack...

343
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,440
Contains unique...

344
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,680
That's so fun...

345
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,740
Special appearances and effects...

346
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,400
In game...

347
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,440
The player can also...

348
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,120
Find and enjoy...

349
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,420
Secret and specialized...

350
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:11,780
Items...

351
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,260
Weapons...

352
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,880
And uniforms...

353
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,760
To use and enjoy...

354
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,540
Infiltration situations...

355
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,740
And of course...

356
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,740
One more thing...

357
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
I can't wait for the new secret...

358
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,620
Fox Hunt...

359
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,780
I'm Yu Sahara...

360
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,320
The director for Fox Hunt Mode...

361
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
And Metal Gear Solid Delta...

362
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,420
Snake Eater...

363
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,040
Fox Hunt is a completely original...

364
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,700
Online multiplayer mode...

365
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,140
Though it shares the same world...

366
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,400
With Metal Gear Solid Delta...

367
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,960
Snake Eater...

368
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,740
The gameplay is completely different...

369
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,660
When we say Metal Gear Multiplayer...

370
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Many fans will probably think of...

371
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,700
Metal Gear Online...

372
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,640
But Fox Hunt...

373
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,540
Will be its own...

374
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,840
New type of mode...

375
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,580
Oh...

376
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,200
Praise for MGO...

377
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,500
We very much appreciate...

378
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,160
All the longtime fans of MGO...

379
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,580
Who have always wanted to see it...

380
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,280
Make a comeback...

381
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,360
I never got to play it...

382
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,180
But the landscape of multiplayer games...

383
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,120
Has changed a lot...

384
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,860
Since MGO...

385
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,100
It took a lot of...

386
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,940
Careful consideration...

387
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,480
To think about...

388
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
What a new online mode...

389
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,140
Should look like...

390
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,440
Based on the iconic...

391
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,900
Stealth and survival elements...

392
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,240
In the Metal Gear series...

393
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,900
We are taking...

394
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,260
Camouflage and hide-and-go-seek...

395
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,080
To the next level...

396
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,540
Oh no...

397
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,100
It's...

398
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,540
It's Prop Hut...

399
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,580
It's Prop Hut...

400
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,600
To make something unique...

401
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,620
That is more than...

402
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,480
Just a shootout...

403
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
We've used that...

404
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,700
Back and forth tension...

405
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,620
Of staying hidden...

406
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,860
Or searching out the enemy...

407
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,620
To create an online experience...

408
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,860
Unique to Metal Gear...

409
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,400
But I want to play as Ocelot...

410
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,840
In a new form...

411
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:38,920
In a new form...

412
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,620
In a new form...

413
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,380
Please?

414
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,580
Those are all the details...

415
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,280
We can share with you...

416
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,600
For now...

417
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,560
But we're working hard...

418
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
On getting Fox Hunt...

419
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,280
To you all...

420
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,060
What?

421
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,720
We plan to have more news...

422
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,380
On Fox Hunt...

423
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,960
In the future...

424
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,820
So please...

425
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,900
Stay tuned...

426
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,720
About the game...

427
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,460
As it develops...

428
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,940
The game...

429
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,280
Should be developed...

430
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,860
It comes out...

431
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,220
In like...

432
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,060
Two months...

433
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,970
Oh...

434
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,910
Oh...

435
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:07,890
Oh...

436
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,270
Oh...

437
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:08,470
Oh...

438
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,550
And the Moa...

439
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,950
So look forward to hearing...

440
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:12,670
Even more about...

441
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,250
What's coming...

442
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,750
In Metal Gear Solid Delta...

443
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,830
Snake Eater...

444
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,610
Thank you...

445
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,020
Oh...

446
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,360
I'm glad it's not another...

447
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,160
Battle Royale...

448
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,740
Hm...

449
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,280
No way...

450
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,760
Hi, it's Ramold Carpon.

451
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,240
I'm executive... These guys are infiltrating the stream.

452
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,540
I'm Mika Tanguy, art director.

453
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,340
And I'm Gilles Jha, creative director.

454
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:42,880
Hey!

455
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,580
This wasn't part of the plan.

456
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,080
This wasn't on the schedule.

457
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,900
This is the game that looks like Metal Gear, though.

458
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,100
What?

459
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,520
They didn't even say, like, oh, excuse us for, uh...

460
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,960
For, uh, you know, interrupting your scheduling program.

461
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,240
Is that all that they're gonna say about Metal Gear?

462
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,660
He's been bamboozled!

463
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,620
To use all of these abilities to progress through the adventure and return to the ocean.

464
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,520
Are they gonna show the MGS2 room?

465
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,340
We'd like to thank everyone who gave us such a warm welcome when we announced the game a few months ago.

466
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,740
Ooh.

467
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,960
So thank you all.

468
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,700
We can't wait for you to try out the game.

469
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,500
See you soon.

470
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,860
No, they didn't even show it.

471
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,800
I thought they were gonna be like, look at this room.

472
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,100
Doesn't it remind you of Metal Gear or something?

473
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,740
What's happening?

474
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,140
Oh my god!

475
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,500
We got bamboozled for real!

476
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,170
Can you play a snake in this game?

477
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,490
Come on.

478
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,030
Come on.

479
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,090
Or something.

480
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,090
Who are these people?

481
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,730
I don't know Miles Edgeworth.

482
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,150
I don't know.

483
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,530
Apparently one of them is a Messi.

484
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,310
That guy is famous.

485
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,930
This is not a snake.

486
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,120
I don't even know how to react right now.

487
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I don't even know how to react right now.

488
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,800
I woke up for this for 10...

489
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,820
Not even 10 minutes of Metal Gear.

490
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,600
They showed the same trailer.

491
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,700
How much can you show of soccer?

492
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,060
The game has been the same for like 100 years.

493
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,800
I don't know.

494
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,610
I'm eating my oatmeal.

495
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,850
Is that Messi on the right?

496
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,370
Me on the right?

497
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,590
Not the fiddle.

498
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,930
Yeah, we did get...

499
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,790
They played us like a damn fiddle.

500
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,590
Football.

501
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,570
Football.

502
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,670
It's literally called Football TM.

503
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,670
Oh, it's free to play.

504
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,930
MLB Pro Spirit.

505
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,210
I'm going to curl myself right now.

506
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:28,990
Pro Spirit is a mobile baseball game where you can play with all 30 MLB teams and their real-life lineups.

507
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,530
I don't care about sports.

508
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,550
Make it easy to feel like you're on the field anytime, anywhere.

509
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,090
Wait a second, though.

510
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,650
Everybody in the comments was crying about...

511
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,310
...was crying about Castlevania.

512
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,030
Like in the pre-chat.

513
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,210
If they're not only just...

514
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,390
And I was like, they're only going to talk about Metal Gear and Silent Hill.

515
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,150
Sillies.

516
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,830
Why would they talk about Castlevania?

517
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,610
Wait, so wait.

518
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,330
What if they actually do?

519
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,030
Rising 2.

520
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,270
That'd be crazy.

521
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,170
Mother Baseball.

522
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,430
That would be...

523
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,170
Such a good...

524
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,970
Game.

525
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,870
In...

526
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,690
Like...

527
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,810
For 5.

528
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,830
Oh my gosh.

529
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,730
I would learn the rules of baseball.

530
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,910
At least show Power Pro.

531
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,810
I'm sick of these 3D people.

532
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,210
On my tiny phone.

533
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,270
Enjoy real MLB action with real quality and real detail.

534
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,870
You could just watch it.

535
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,010
On TV.

536
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,990
For fans of gaming.

537
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:06,950
People would...

538
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,550
For fans of MLB.

539
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,370
People will go crazy for Otani, though.

540
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,170
For fans of Shohei Otani.

541
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,170

543
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,720
Do you like baseball?

544
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,200
Do you like...

545
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,900
Shohei Otani?

546
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,870
Hello, Yu-Gi-Oh fans.

547
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,210
My name is Grant Williams.

548
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,150
Professional basketball player for the Charlotte...

549
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,930
Basketball?

550
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,670
No, this is Yu-Gi-Oh.

551
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,870
I'm a huge Yu-Gi-Oh fan.

552
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,490
Not only just Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, but the anime I watched continuously growing up.

553
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,350
As a Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel player, I've experienced a lot of challenges.

554
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,490
Whether it's trying to find a new Twix called a new Exodia deck...

555
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,370
Exodia...

556
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,110
Trying to take down this Trap Tricks deck.

557
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,190
I know that it takes a lot of skill and a lot of courage.

558
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,390
Not only to build the right deck, but also to be the most skillless Duelist.

559
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,450
I can't remember what deck I used to build.

560
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,390
The Road to Worlds as well as the World Championships.

561
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,430
I want to wish you all luck.

562
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,230
And I want you guys to continue to believe in the hard of the cards.

563
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,750
Because you never know who your next opponent might be.

564
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,450
Who's pitcher and who's catcher?

565
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,450
The biggest stage of Yu-Gi-Oh TCG.

566
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,450
The WCS 2025 qualifiers.

567
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,250
The World Championship qualifiers will be held on the following schedule.

568
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,610
South America WCQ June 6-8.

569
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,230
That...

570
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,110
Central America WCQ July 4-6.

571
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,790
Oceana WCQ July 5-6.

572
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,410
North America WCQ July 11-13.

573
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,470
Europe WCQ July 25-27.

574
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,550
Aim for the World Champion.

575
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,190
What if someone was...

576
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,510
What was it?

577
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,050
South America?

578
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,070
What if they were like...

579
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,450
I'm so ready for the championships.

580
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,730
Announce it.

581
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,670
I've been...

582
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,330
I've been practicing my whole life.

583
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,670
Party?

584
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,170
I never thought...

585
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,690
It was such a sportsman.

586
00:30:59,530 --> 00:30:59,910
Anime.

587
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,330
Sports.

588
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:05,770
Wee-hee.

589
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:05,870
Crane-y.

590
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,090
Crane-crane-deck-yea.

591
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,340
Okay, I'm gonna turn off the subtitles since...

592
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,460
Yuki-oh card game, The Chronicles?

593
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,400
Anime?

594
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,380
Promotional short anime series.

595
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,880
The stories that lie within the cards come to life.

596
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,200
Oh.

597
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,120
Kaiba.

598
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,400
Suikoden.

599
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,400
Suikoden.

600
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,890
I feel so bamboozled right now.

601
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,310
Am I an idiot for assuming they were only going to talk about Metal Gear and Silent Hill?

602
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,650
Because those are the only things on the...

603
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,770
Duna and Unification Wars.

604
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,550
And I am Tetsuya Agushi, the director for this title.

605
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,330
I really thought.

606
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,830
They said and more?

607
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,190
Oh, did they?

608
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,590
I only saw that they were going to talk about those two in the picture.

609
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,850
And I said, okay, I'll be there.

610
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,070
I got baited by the thumbnail.

611
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,590
I was like, what are they going to talk about here and not in the hotline tomorrow?

612
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,530
God damn it.

613
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,390
I put too much honey and it all went into the bottom of my oatmeal.

614
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,270
So it's like super sweet.

615
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,510
They are like, Suikoden.

616
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,830
Suikoden.

617
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,110
Suikoden.

618
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,010
Starly.

619
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,210
I am Shinya Fujimatsu, producer of Suikoden Starly.

620
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,420
Okay, now I'll turn those subtitles back on.

621
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,590
Mucho Texto.

622
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,830
Did you just say it's a mobile game?

623
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,400
I actually don't mind if things are mobile games as long as they're not like so...

624
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,340
Pay to...

625
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,620
You know...

626
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,820
Unlock stuff.

627
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,600
I actually don't mind.

628
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,340
Because it's just like...

629
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,760
So many people are used to...

630
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,840
Portable gaming anyway.

631
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,680
If it's gotcha, then it's kind of like...

632
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,760
You know...

633
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,620
But if it's just like...

634
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,100
Oh, you just buy the game and it's on your phone.

635
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,720
It's amazing.

636
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,840
Wow, that was so nice.

637
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,780
Oh, there they go.

638
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,660
Very slowly.

639
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,990
It looks really nice.

640
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,230
I don't know anything about it.

641
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,590
I don't know anything about Suiko.

642
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:58,470
Hoping that more people around the world can enjoy the world of Suikoden, we've decided to launch the game globally on Steam so that it can be played on PCs in addition to mobile devices.

643
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:58,870
Oh!

644
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,830
There you go!

645
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,870
We have also opened our Steam store today.

646
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,450
So it's on Steam, too!

647
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,670
I love this trend of bringing mobile games to Steam.

648
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,930
I actually am such a fan.

649
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,010
They're bringing Blue Archive to Steam.

650
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,410
I was like, woohoo!

651
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,670
I'm such a fan.

652
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,570
Free-to-play includes in-game purchases.

653
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,750
There it is.

654
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:38,150
It seems almost like an ad for the game coming out, Sam's.

655
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,910
Gradius.

656
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,280
In-game purchases.

657
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,780
You pay $4.99 to get rid of ads.

658
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,670
I remember playing this at my dentist's office.

659
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,280
I would play Gradius at the dentist.

660
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,160
And only there.

661
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,380
Why dentists have console?

662
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,320
I don't know.

663
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,580
They were like, the children are bored.

664
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,620
Salamander 3!

665
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,710
I guess it's just a collection.

666
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,150
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

667
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,210
Awww.

668
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,230
Series stuff and fans.

669
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,930
Why does it seem so final?

670
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,650
Winston, sir.

671
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,330
Winston Green.

672
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:08,770
Wait.

673
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,330
This seems like my kind of game.

674
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,450
I've seen them posting about this before, but...

675
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,430
We deliver anything.

676
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,290
Wait.

677
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,830
Wait.

678
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,650
I didn't realize this game was so awesome.

679
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:22,890
Are you blind?

680
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:23,530
Wait.

681
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,210
I saw them advertising this, but I was like, oh, it's just, you know, car game.

682
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,530
I didn't...

683
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,070
Wait.

684
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,930
I didn't realize it was so awesome.

685
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,410
We're driving ourselves on completing every delivery.

686
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,710
We're reshaping the very essence of delivery services.

687
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,020
Efficiency.

688
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,000
There he goes.

689
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,420
There he goes.

690
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,500
There he goes.

691
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,960
Hey, that delivery is mine to make.

692
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh, you just stole it.

693
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,500
There he goes.

694
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,800
The beginning.

695
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,200
This is a GTA 6, everybody?

696
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,180
I don't know off about you, kid.

697
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,500
I just...

698
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,000
know it.

699
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,280
I've never encountered a case as unprecedented as this one.

700
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,740
You think you can push me around?

701
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,980
Well, I have news for you.

702
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,920
Okay.

703
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,090
Whoa, whoa!

704
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,970
Courier boy.

705
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,270
Wait, there's mystery?

706
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,330
What is this game?

707
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,450
What?

708
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,550
Wait.

709
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,370
This game seems like a hundred percent... There's aliens?!

710
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:52,730
Deliver All Costs is a narratively driven action game where everything is destructible, where you follow a character...

711
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,590
That's all you needed to say!

712
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,550
Time for a spiral towards insanity!

713
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:08,090
Deliver All Costs is a game that puts you in the shoes of this very unlikely everyday man who is put upon and frustrated with all the troubles that every one of us has experienced in their everyday life.

714
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:14,730
But you have this perfect opportunity to let loose and explore this world and destroy it.

715
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,630
If you should want to.

716
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,690
And you will be constantly challenged and...

717
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,990
I will be challenged.

718
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,630
And hopefully you will also constantly be given reasons to laugh.

719
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,410
Wait, this game seems awesome.

720
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,890
Very subtle.

721
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,170
Just in time.

722
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,470
Uh oh.

723
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,050
I think I hear the leaf blower again.

724
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,850
Oh, I was about to say, isn't this fairy tale?

725
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,770
Same artist.

726
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:47,970
Oh!

727
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,570
Well...

728
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,350
If you like the game, I guess.

729
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,040
Oh!

730
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,440
Oh!

731
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,280
You wanted Metal Gear?

732
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,120
Here's...

733
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,980
E-T-E-R-U-G-E-R!

734
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,220
I'm gonna...

735
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,860
I'm gonna...

736
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,360
Oh wait!

737
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,380
It was an anime and now it's a game.

738
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,180
Oh gosh.

739
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,260
I can't keep up.

740
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,240
I can't keep up!

741
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,480
I can't keep up.

742
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,180
Oh!

743
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,680
Oh, not too great Shiki and happy happy.

744
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,400
And Lucy Rebecca.

745
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,180
That really does look like happy.

746
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,260
Oh my god.

747
00:41:59,380 --> 00:41:59,480
Oh!

748
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,780
Who is Shiki?

749
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,800
That's literally just happy, no?

750
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,360
The little cat!

751
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,940
Save data can be carried over.

752
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,380
Nice.

753
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,400
We've made it.

754
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,200
Tough decisions.

755
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,960
To make Metal Gear Delta an epic game store...

756
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,460
What is this?

757
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,360
I...

758
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,040
What?

759
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,230
What is this?

760
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,320
This is Metal Gear Survive.

761
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,860
All these games are Metal Gear, guys.

762
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,240
You just don't realize it.

763
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,740
Finders keepers.

764
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,100
I stole a turtle.

765
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,480
No inventory management.

766
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,660
Wait, you don't have inventory?

767
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,620
Or...

768
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,840
You have to carry everything?

769
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,340
Simple crafting.

770
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,640
Sorry if you can hear the leaf blower.

771
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,640
Wait, what?

772
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,460
Cook food to get stronger.

773
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,040
Short, fast-paced play sessions.

774
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,000
So you just...

775
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,760
Be a smarty pants.

776
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,980
Wait, where's the...

777
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,700
The danger?

778
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,400
Solve puzzles.

779
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,030
Wait, where's the danger?

780
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,090
Kids game.

781
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,210
Yeah, it seems really chill.

782
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,270
It kind of seems fun.

783
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:01,510
It kind of seems fun.

784
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,250
It kind of seems fun.

785
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:05,890
I'm a survival kid.

786
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,690
So a snake.

787
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,850
He puts on the camo and he goes...

788
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:12,350
Survival.

789
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,870
Up to four kids.

790
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,690
The cat is named Happy in both Fairy Tail and Eden Zero, but he's a robot.

791
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,130
Oh, interesting.

792
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,850
There's no failure to the game either.

793
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:23,950
You can complete the puzzle.

794
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:24,950
Killed the interview yesterday.

795
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:25,510
Thanks for the luck.

796
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,150
That's cool!

797
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,670
Exploring it, completing the puzzle, and then building a raft, and then escaping.

798
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:32,970
You can come back...

799
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,770
Bandai.

800
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,830
There's hidden objects in the world.

801
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,170
There's fish to fire.

802
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:37,810
Wrong...

803
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,350
There's...

804
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,110
Wrong...

805
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:40,450
...company.

806
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,230
He's combo.

807
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,090
He's combo.

808
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,930
I like the little laser.

809
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,930
Oh, I thought he was your pet.

810
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:50,570
Oh my.

811
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,870
Finders keepers.

812
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:56,610
Oh!

813
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,970
Wait, this is a sequel?

814
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,630
To an anime game?

815
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:04,930
Wait!

816
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:08,750
What?

817
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,390
We had a tremendous amount of fun making the game.

818
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:12,870
We had a tremendous amount of fun making the game.

819
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,070
We should have made it more anime.

820
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,830
The players enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.

821
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,110
It was on Game Boy.

822
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,710
How do you...

823
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,310
How do you multiplayer that?

824
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,520
Oh!

825
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,420
It's time!

826
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,020
For the other thing I woke up for.

827
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,220
Here, I'll turn off the subtitles.

828
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,020
Did you guys see the article about...

829
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,200
The main actress being like when I was filming this game.

830
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,900
I think I was going insane.

831
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,090
Oh, yes please.

832
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:01,810
Silent Hill was a series that fused the essence of Western horror and Japanese horror.

833
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,990
But as the series progressed...

834
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,710
Then it's good.

835
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,490
Mmhmm.

836
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,230
Exactly.

837
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:14,310
I began to feel a desire to create a Silent Hill with 100% essence of Japanese style horror.

838
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,670
Wow.

839
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:22,070
If I were to create a Silent Hill with a Japanese aesthetic, I believed that a production team from Japan or Asia would be ideal.

840
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,490
At that time, I came across Neobards.

841
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,150
I felt they were a great team...

842
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,350
Neobards...

843
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,570
...as they had worked with several major Japanese publishers and were able to communicate smoothly.

844
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,650
We're going to just dox their building.

845
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,250
Our team, Neobards, has been working together for almost 20 years.

846
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,730
We're thrilled that our past work caught the attention of producer, Okamoto, leading to this collaboration.

847
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,950
He's the origami killer.

848
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,290
Many members of our team are long time fans of Silent Hill and Ryokishio 7.

849
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,010
We also began having in-depth discussions...

850
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,810
...and I'm going to try to develop a game experience...

851
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,690
He's got so many origami's!

852
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,090
...within a Japanese atmosphere.

853
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:06,190
With the major thematic shift, it was absolutely critical for us to not merely copy, but really understand what the key atmospheric elements that defined the classic Silent Hill titles were.

854
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:06,650
Yes.

855
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:07,970
In order to involve them...

856
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,250
That is so terrifying.

857
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,670
So we spent a lot of time iterating and discussing between...

858
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,990
That was so scary!

859
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,550
...and how to bring that uneasy charm and loneliness of Ebisugoka to life.

860
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:24,990
Keeping in tradition with the Silent Hill series, our protagonist Tinako is also designed to be an ordinary person.

861
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,210
However, it was crucial to us to have fun and interesting gameplay.

862
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:37,310
For Silent Hill F, the team spent a lot of time focusing on creating a combat system that would feel both fresh but familiar.

863
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,830
I was literally telling... I went to Daiso.

864
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:43,610
I was telling my friend they have the foam swords there.

865
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:48,670
And I was like, oh my gosh, those are always the foam swords you see used at mocap studios.

866
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,370
The setting of Silent Hill F are shifting from the town of Silent Hill to Japan.

867
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,690
She was using it!

868
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:58,010
But it remains a psychological horror experience where one confronts themselves within a mental world.

869
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,850
Taking into account that it's a psychological horror horror...

870
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,510
We sought to enhance the essence of Japanese-style horror.

871
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:12,790
The hallmark of Japanese horror is not simply grotesqueness, but the coexistence of beauty and the disturbing.

872
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,990
We are creating this title with a concept, Find the Beauty in Terror.

873
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,110
As a key concept in Silent Hill F is the idea of beauty and terror.

874
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:23,770
Sorry.

875
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,870
We created our visual designs to have a distinct uneasiness to them.

876
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,010
Oh, it looks so good.

877
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,210
But also have a worth of charm that would make it so you just couldn't stop staring.

878
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:42,990
In this matter, we were extremely fortunate to be able to work with Kerasan to design our key character art as their designs perfectly suited the ideal of beauty and terror.

879
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,250
Gorgeous.

880
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,330
Oh my god.

881
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:54,110
Regarding the setting, we carefully considered which era would provide stage and environment that could depict the theme of the story with a higher contrast.

882
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,350
And I chose it accordingly.

883
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,610
I need the art book for this, like, so bad.

884
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,730
I need it right now.

885
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,030
Oh my god.

886
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,690
The show era, though just half a century ago, feels like a different world.

887
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:09,450
One that remains connected to our present, yet preserves customs and superstitions long forgotten in modern life.

888
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,110
I hope you'll enjoy that contrast as well.

889
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:26,170
Another key reason we chose this time frame and location was that there were many, many elements we could draw from that would both feel familiar, yet alien to many players, supporting that sense of uneasiness.

890
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:40,350
When designing the levels, we began by using the Kinkatsu area of Kinsan Town as a foundation, then selected several representative Japanese locations, such as Dagashiya, schools, shrines, and more.

891
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:46,570
These locations, with their strong Showa era atmosphere, help immerse the levels in a distinctly Japanese setting.

892
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:52,550
Of course, we haven't forgotten the other world of Silent Hill, which is a core element of the franchise.

893
00:49:52,550 --> 00:50:01,550
After extensive discussions and iterations, and collaboration with Ryukishi Osu's storyline, we crafted a level experience unique to Silent Hill F.

894
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:06,510
We believe that for Asian players, these Japanese-style environments will feel familiar.

895
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,790
While for Western players, they will be striking and intriguing.

896
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:15,210
Through this game, we hope more players can experience a unique aesthetics and design sensibilities of Japanese culture.

897
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,690
We're tackling a type of theme that has never been explored in the Silent Hill series before.

898
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,310
Personally, I believe it's a theme well-suited to the world of Silent Hill.

899
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:27,370
But I'll leave it to all of you to decide whether it truly fits.

900
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,810
We had countless discussions with Neobards about direction and expression throughout development.

901
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,590
Ryukishi, you madman.

902
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:39,210
I truly feel that everything we hoped to convey through the scenario was fully understood and embraced by the team.

903
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:39,890
Ryukishi 7 is scriptwriter?

904
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:42,330
Oh yeah, that's why people are so excited for this game.

905
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,250
One of our core development goals was to make sure Ryukishi...

906
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,150
It's actually peak.

907
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,510
Like, this game is gonna be insane.

908
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,410
I can't wait.

909
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,210
Oh my god.

910
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,030
I can't wait.

911
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,830
...is very, very different than that of a playable game.

912
00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:04,370
There was a lot of discussion and iteration between our teams on what things would need to be adjusted, why they would need to be adjusted, and how to best go about it.

913
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,650
Why?

914
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,890
For instance, something we had to consider was the flow of the levels in relation to the story.

915
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,230
Such as when to push players along.

916
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:12,950
They're a little...

917
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:13,830
They're so bad.

918
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:22,370
In order to present Ryukishi sounds lower in the most suitable way, we'd organize what information would fit best where.

919
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,430
Such as through environmental storytelling, Fog town.

920
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:33,610
Secondary information such as a note you'd pick up during gameplay, characterization through animations, VO, etc, etc.

921
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:38,270
And of course, what parts would be most suitable as a cutscene?

922
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:39,510
Mm-hmm.

923
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:46,570
I believe the narrative design of this title is built on one original core element and two fresh new aspects.

924
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,190
The core lies in how we carry forward the unique sense of dread and horror that defines Silent Hill.

925
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:56,150
The new aspects come from the story crafted by Ryukishi 07, and the gameplay design that complements it.

926
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:02,370
We carefully considered which moments should create direct stress through gameplay, and which should evoke fear through camera work and composition.

927
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:12,750
With this title shifting from a Western setting to Japan, we aim not only to reflect that change in the environment, but also to ensure that the performance and presentation evoke a cultural atmosphere that resonates with players.

928
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,500
I'm obsessed.

929
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:24,660
Oh!

930
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:24,860
Ew!

931
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,980
Oh my god.

932
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:28,760
Ew!

933
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,300
That's nasty.

934
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,320
Beautiful.

935
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,300
God, this game is so beautiful.

936
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,100
Oh!

937
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,600
It's so...

938
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,260
Oh, it's so pretty.

939
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,600
My god.

940
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
Oh my gosh.

941
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,960
I can't stop gushing about it.

942
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,940
It's so pretty.

943
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,410
Oh!

944
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,590
Oh!

945
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,250
I'm so excited.

946
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,830
What?

947
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:02,510
Oh!

948
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,090
Oh!

949
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:06,150
Oh!

950
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,170
Oh!

951
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,210
Silent Hill Rubik!

952
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,020
They're working with Bloober again.

953
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,760
But people...

954
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,540
People really liked...

955
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,200
People really liked Silent Hill 2, so...

956
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,760
I will give them a second chance.

957
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,090
Was that it?

958
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,650
Yeah, they said I was gonna be pretty short.

959
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,590
They said it was gonna be about this long, so...

960
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,310
Um...

961
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:53,550
Oh!

962
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:56,790
You can't...

963
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:56,950
Oh!

964
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,050
40% off?

965
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:58,910
Okay, wait.

966
00:53:58,970 --> 00:53:59,650
I can grab it.

967
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:04,870
Cool.

968
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,400
Was that everything?

969
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,340
That was everything, right?

970
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,650
Wait, how much is it?

971
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:18,950
Hold on.

972
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,230
I'm gonna go check.

973
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,270
Silent Hill 2.

974
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:26,850
My birthday.

975
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,890
Oh yeah, it really is 40% off.

976
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,490
Nice!

977
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,210
I think it's Bloober remaking Silent Hill 1.

978
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:41,370
Yeah!

979
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,270
It said it.

980
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:43,390
On the screen.

981
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:47,710
Um...

982
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,530
Should we watch, uh...

983
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,930
We could watch, um...

984
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:53,910
The...

985
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:54,750
We could watch...

986
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,170
The...

987
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,790
The Metal Gear part again.

988
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,840
We could, um...

989
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,780
Rewatch the Metal Gear part to feel like there's...

990
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,730
Um...

991
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,810
A quiet wish.

992
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,590
To bring joy to someone, somewhere.

993
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:27,370
From that flame of passion, Konami games are born.

994
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,750
Silent Hill remake, though.

995
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,190
That's exciting.

996
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:49,730
Are the dogs gonna... I always think of that one screenshot of, um...

997
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:57,710
Of, what's his name, being in front of the dog house, and then there's the dog coming at him.

998
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,530
And he's like, I think there's a dog here.

999
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,690
Give us frame by frame description.

1000
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:07,650
Wait.

1001
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,150
Sorry, I want to look at everything now.

1002
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,310
I do want to take a look.

1003
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:15,270
Nah.

1004
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:17,690
Oh no, this is the area with the dogs.

1005
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,750
They haven't shown us the dogs yet.

1006
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,570
Yeah.

1007
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:27,310
Whoa.

1008
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:28,590
Hold on.

1009
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:29,690
Sorry.

1010
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:33,010
I'll turn it down a little since I'll be starting and stopping it.

1011
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:34,650
Look at that bird.

1012
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,270
I'm gonna eat that bird.

1013
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,370
No dogs yet.

1014
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,250
Oh.

1015
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,390
Oh.

1016
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:46,370
The fire.

1017
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:48,970
Oh.

1018
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:49,970
Oh.

1019
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,850
Oh.

1020
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:55,870
This is when you climb up the hill, and you have to crawl into the little hidey-hows.

1021
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,050
That guy?

1022
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,330
You know he's close.

1023
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,630
That guy?

1024
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,590
I love the way the Crockat kind of goes like...

1025
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,810
And the traps.

1026
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,790
Look how nasty he is.

1027
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,190
Enemy position unknown.

1028
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,630
Oh.

1029
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:13,050
Golly.

1030
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,130
They just made the secret Rykov behind.

1031
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,010
It's so funny.

1032
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:21,910
Cute.

1033
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,210
I know we've already seen this before.

1034
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,290
Alright, Commander.

1035
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,190
Floating like this.

1036
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,250
It's a revolution.

1037
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,090
Alright, Commander.

1038
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,770
Alright, Commander.

1039
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:39,250
Ender.

1040
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,140
Wow, they did a really good job.

1041
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,100
There's nobody in there.

1042
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,480
There's nobody in there, River.

1043
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,840
There's nobody there.

1044
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,800
Oh, wait.

1045
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,860
Unless he's already reached the end of it.

1046
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,700
He's pretty close.

1047
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,450
I love the effect there.

1048
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:18,830
When he...

1049
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:19,250
This...

1050
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:19,770
That...

1051
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,810
It looks so awesome.

1052
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,070
Whoa.

1053
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,570
The lighting in here is actually kind of insane.

1054
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,950
That was like the first thing I noticed.

1055
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,450
It's so dark.

1056
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,610
Like, what happened to the lights?

1057
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,870
In the original, like, you're in a warehouse.

1058
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:33,950
Everybody is...

1059
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,350
It's work hours.

1060
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,610
Pacifist run.

1061
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:40,370
Yeah, exactly.

1062
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,130
Looks like he's in a fighting game.

1063
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,230
It looks awesome.

1064
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,970
Vulcan looks so good in this game.

1065
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,910
I mean, everybody looks so good.

1066
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,650
I was really worried how they'd do Eva.

1067
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:59,410
Because I did not like how she looked in a...

1068
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,090
In...

1069
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,530
In the patchy slot.

1070
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,250
But Eva in this game...

1071
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,530
She looks hot.

1072
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,250
She looks so good.

1073
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,170
Hold on.

1074
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,210
I want to see Snake's stupid little grin.

1075
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,690
That's so cute.

1076
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,150
Gotcha.

1077
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:20,970
Gotcha.

1078
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,210
My boy's cheesing.

1079
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,070
He's so excited.

1080
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,930
He's so excited to hold the monkey.

1081
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,230
Dad and son.

1082
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:41,530
Gotcha.

1083
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,830
Missile gear.

1084
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,650
I love...

1085
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,290
Oh my gosh.

1086
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:52,630
The cut scenes in Japanese from that game were so funny.

1087
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,010
Because Snake would be like...

1088
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,670
What are you gonna do now?

1089
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,230
And also...

1090
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,870
Wait.

1091
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,850
Now that I think about it...

1092
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,170
That was David Hayter, no?

1093
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,330
Well...

1094
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:07,360
So we'll actually have David Hayter's voice...

1095
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,150
For...

1096
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,450
For Snake vs.

1097
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:10,890
Monkey.

1098
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,230
Because...

1099
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,230
Original Snake vs.

1100
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,190
Monkey...

1101
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,190
In English is not David Hayter.

1102
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:17,710
That's huge!

1103
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:18,890
Wait.

1104
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,310
That's actually...

1105
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:22,750
I just thought about that.

1106
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,490
That's actually so big.

1107
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,550
Young Eva or Old Eva?

1108
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:30,950
Both.

1109
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,390
I didn't even think about that.

1110
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,530
Who was Snake in the original?

1111
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:36,750
I don't know, but...

1112
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:40,770
The guy does not sound like Snake at all.

1113
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,450
It's actually so funny.

1114
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,750
I mean...

1115
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:45,810
But...

1116
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:46,430
But...

1117
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,630
But in the cutscene, Snake will be like...

1118
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:49,930
What are you gonna do?

1119
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,390
And then you just hear the monkey go...

1120
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,850
K, k, k, k, k, k...

1121
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,430
K, k, k, k, k...

1122
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:59,850
K, k, k, k...

1123
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,070
Hold on, let me see.

1124
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,130
Maybe I can find like a video.

1125
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:05,830
Hold on.

1126
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,050
So you guys can hear it.

1127
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,410
If you haven't heard it before.

1128
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,610
Snake versus monkey.

1129
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:19,030
Oh wait, I'm getting like actual snakes.

1130
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:21,490
Monkey versus snake battle.

1131
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,190
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1132
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,210
Wait, this one maybe.

1133
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,830
This is like the ending cutscene, but...

1134
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:30,870
Hold on.

1135
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,510
Hold on, let me go to the cutscene.

1136
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,050
Okay, here.

1137
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:41,290
That's snake!

1138
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,650
That's supposed to be snake!

1139
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,290
Hold on, let me...

1140
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:50,190
Let me, here, I'll get it up.

1141
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,970
No, that is not solid snake.

1142
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,470
Oh wait, how does the capture look?

1143
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,290
I might have to readjust it.

1144
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:06,970
There we go.

1145
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:09,990
Oh, whoops.

1146
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,190
So you're an... agent, huh?

1147
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,830
Sure are one brave little monkey.

1148
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:19,030
It doesn't sound like it.

1149
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:20,330
Sure are by as you've got there.

1150
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,790
Anyway, I guess we brought the world back from the brink of catastrophe.

1151
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:27,750
It was all due to you.

1152
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:28,450
Woo...

1153
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:29,250
Hee-hee!

1154
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,550
By the way, you haven't been properly introduced yet.

1155
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:33,990
I'm Snake.

1156
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:36,390
You can call me that from now on.

1157
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,190
And you...

1158
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,590
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee?

1159
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:44,010
Kiki... Kiki... Interesting.

1160
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,970
A pair of snakes.

1161
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,450
Nice to meet you, Snake.

1162
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,330
I think we are going to get along just fine.

1163
01:02:52,710 --> 01:03:05,990
Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... Sometimes I just quote that.

1164
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,570
Sometimes I'll just be like...

1165
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:14,350
Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... Kiki... But yeah, anyway.

1166
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,250
Maman... Do you think Grimalo will be in the game?

1167
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
This though?

1168
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,780
Secret theater?

1169
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,500
I'm so excited!

1170
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,780
God, I wish.

1171
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:42,590
What was this called?

1172
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:43,330
Fox Hunt?

1173
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:44,610
I think.

1174
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,350
Not M.G.O.

1175
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,650
Little different from M.G.O.

1176
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:50,770
Hmm...

1177
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:53,410
I'm Yuji Korakaru, the creative producer.

1178
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,470
For this trailer, we wanted to focus on the gameplay.

1179
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,890
Peter Luriet, the voice of Snake.

1180
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:00,990
Oh...

1181
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:02,370
Kiki has come too.

1182
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:16,490
I feel... I saw some people being like...

1183
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,370
Oh, why are they exclusive...

1184
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:19,870
To...

1185
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,850
I think because...

1186
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,630
Licensing.

1187
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:23,750
You guys.

1188
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,190
I feel like...

1189
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:25,990
That's why.

1190
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,370
Licensing is always such an issue.

1191
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,970
So...

1192
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,270
Uh...

1193
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,650
Yeah.

1194
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:45,590
In the Xbox version, we collaborated with another Konami series, Bomberman, to create Snake vs Bomberman.

1195
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:49,130
Where you'll enter the jungle to chase down and blast away Bomberman.

1196
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:50,210
To be fair...

1197
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:50,750
Well...

1198
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,350
I personally...

1199
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:53,150
I...

1200
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,290
I want the...

1201
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,250
I want Monkey more than Bomberman, so...

1202
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:59,370
Uh...

1203
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,810
It's no issue for me, but...

1204
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,230
I get it.

1205
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,790
The much requested secret theater also makes a return.

1206
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:09,450
In the remake, the original secret theater videos will now be found as collectibles in-game.

1207
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:10,910
So I have to shake them down?

1208
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:11,590
In addition...

1209
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:11,750
This though.

1210
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:12,370
Hello?

1211
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,070
Hello?

1212
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,590
All new secret theater videos made from...

1213
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,660
Wait, is this our first time seeing Sokolov?

1214
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,320
This is so...

1215
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,660
What is this face?

1216
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,380
This is horrifying.

1217
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,800
Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.

1218
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,660
They'll be secretly carried by enemy soldiers.

1219
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:46,980
So try to track them down.

1220
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,700
Oh, how many will there be?

1221
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,580
We saw them before.

1222
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,220
Oh, I just forgot then.

1223
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,920
How many will there be?

1224
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,000
I guess the original ones and then...

1225
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,560
At least two.

1226
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,540
Gotta shake them down.

1227
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,940
Look at this.

1228
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:08,760
Oh, wait.

1229
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,360
Hold on.

1230
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,960
I also wanted to stop it earlier.

1231
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,060
It was going so fast.

1232
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,680
Oh, my gosh.

1233
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,000
It looks so good.

1234
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,680
It looks like...

1235
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,500
Like a...

1236
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,120
Like a Japanese armor, you know?

1237
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,440
Sneaking...

1238
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,180
The Sneaking...

1239
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:24,500
The Sneaking...

1240
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:25,740
The Sneaking...

1241
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:25,820
The Sneaking...

1242
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,600
The Sneaking DLC pack contains...

1243
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,300
Oh...

1244
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,580
Neat uniforms with special appearances and effects.

1245
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:38,140
In-game, the player can also find and enjoy secret and specialized items, weapons, and uniforms to use and enjoy...

1246
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,120
I can't...

1247
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,680
He's just wagging it in front of his face.

1248
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,300
...

1249
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,480
Good snake.

1250
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,980
This was just images you can hear.

1251
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,420
You can just hear the way that he does.

1252
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,360
And of course, one more thing.

1253
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,080
Fox Hunt.

1254
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,320
Oh, they have the tubs.

1255
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,700
They have the... I only have one of them actually.

1256
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,220
Oh, I have these also.

1257
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,520
I got them from TGS.

1258
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,160
The calorie mate.

1259
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,600
I have them.

1260
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,400
I have them frame.

1261
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,760
Original online multiplayer mode.

1262
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,440
Though it shares the same world with Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater, the gameplay is complete.

1263
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,300
Wait, what was that?

1264
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,240
Though it shares the same world with Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.

1265
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,800
Oh, he's like putting on the... Whoa.

1266
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:45,680
Whoa.

1267
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,000
He's just like, deploy camo.

1268
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:48,380
Whoa.

1269
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,180
Octo camo.

1270
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:57,180
The handkerchief is equally distant between Snake and the guard.

1271
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,460
The guard passes.

1272
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,540
Snake is built differently.

1273
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,580
We very much appreciate all the long-time fans of M.G.O.

1274
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,540
who have always wanted to see it make a comeback.

1275
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:09,300
But the landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot since M.G.O.

1276
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,560
That's crazy.

1277
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,580
It took a lot of careful consideration to think about what a new online mode.

1278
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,040
Please let us play as like other characters though.

1279
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:26,520
Based on the iconic stealth and survival elements in the Metal Gear series, We are taking camouflage and hide-and-go-seek to the next level.

1280
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,040
I don't want to just play as the soldiers.

1281
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,680
I like to see what's going on in here.

1282
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,620
What's going on in here?

1283
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,760
What you got going on?

1284
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:42,900
Hmm.

1285
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:44,660
Hmm.

1286
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,460
I'm happy that you're going to off-glide.

1287
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:57,440
Yeah, even though I wasn't as a guest, I kind of found some ways to sneak in a little bit.

1288
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,120
So...

1289
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:06,100
We've used that back-and-forth tension of staying hidden or searching out the enemy to create an online experience unique to Metal Gear.

1290
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:12,180
Oh...

1291
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,640
Those are all the details we can share with...

1292
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,700
What's going on in there?

1293
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,860
What's going on in there?

1294
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,440
Also, this like...

1295
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,660
Radar is kind of crazy.

1296
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:28,950
PS5.

1297
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:30,830
Yeah, he's playing on the PS5.

1298
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:32,110
Maybe.

1299
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,690
For now, but we're working hard on getting Fox Hunt.

1300
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,010
To you all.

1301
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:39,690
I can't see anything.

1302
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,790
It's too blurry.

1303
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,070
We plan to have more news on Fox Hunt in the future.

1304
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,610
So please, stay tuned.

1305
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,270
Hmm...

1306
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:52,590
Wait.

1307
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:55,710
Oh no, that might just be...

1308
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:57,350
The Ocelot Team...

1309
01:09:58,730 --> 01:09:59,290
Uniform.

1310
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,270
I dissect.

1311
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,190
Snack!

1312
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:04,250
Hehehehe.

1313
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,200
Ah!

1314
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,140
Woo!

1315
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,240
I can't wait to get mine.

1316
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,560
I pre-ordered the version with this statue.

1317
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,400
It looks so good!

1318
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,520
Oh my god!

1319
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,500
I didn't even notice it the first time.

1320
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,400
It looks so good!

1321
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,260
Look at that!

1322
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,040
I'm doing the foley!

1323
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,120
Hehehehehehe.

1324
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:26,860
Hehehehe.

1325
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,160
Hehehehe.

1326
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:28,860
Oh yeah.

1327
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,340
My boy's gonna sound like a trash bag.

1328
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,100
Hehehehe.

1329
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:37,420
Hehehehe.

1330
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,680
Hehehehe.

1331
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:39,940
Hehehehe.

1332
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,000
Hehehehe.

1333
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,220
Hehehehe.

1334
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:47,610
Hehehehe.

1335
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:48,910
Hehehehe.

1336
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,580
Hehehehe.

1337
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,640
Hehehehe.

1338
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:02,960
Hehehehe.

1339
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,570
Hehehehe.

1340
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:06,590
Hehehehe.

1341
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:06,970
Hehehehe.

1342
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:07,650
Hehehehe.

1343
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,010
Hehehehe.

1344
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:08,030
Hehehehe.

1345
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:08,790
Hehehehe.

1346
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09,690
Hehehehe.

1347
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,030
Hehehehe.

1348
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,730
Wait, since we have the hotline tomorrow...

1349
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:18,950
Snake is shirtless.

1350
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,590
Yeah, take a damn.

1351
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:36,810
The game comes out in like a month and a half.

1352
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:41,990
It comes out in like a month and a half.

1353
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,110
What is the hotline?

1354
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,690
So the hotline is something that they were doing...

1355
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:51,060
They started last year, kind of just like updates about...

1356
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:57,450
Metal Gear Delta and like the Metal Gear releases and stuff.

1357
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,470
And...

1358
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:05,910
Just like its own focus on Metal Gear.

1359
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,450
Yeah, new stuff.

1360
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:10,490
Yeah, yeah.

1361
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,650
So they have one tomorrow.

1362
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:14,810
Which they only just announced like...

1363
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,650
The day before.

1364
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:24,130
So I would have probably put that on my schedule instead of this.

1365
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,230
But this was still fun because I obviously...

1366
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:28,270
I put this because I was very excited about...

1367
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:29,930
Silent Hill.

1368
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:31,630
Oh gosh, hold on.

1369
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,910
I also wanna go look at these again.

1370
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,050
Show me the art, baby.

1371
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:36,970
Show me the art.

1372
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,410
This game is so pretty.

1373
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,750
This game is so pretty.

1374
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,210
Hold on.

1375
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,890
There was like some things I was like...

1376
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:47,130
Dang.

1377
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:49,150
Ugh!

1378
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,410
She's so cute!

1379
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:56,250
I wanna see more of the monsters.

1380
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:58,550
I don't remember where they were at though.

1381
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,350
But this one...

1382
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,930
They talked a lot about Silent Hill.

1383
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,870
Which makes sense because they've...

1384
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:07,410
Talked at many lengths about Metal Gear already.

1385
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,730
Do you think they'll talk about Master Collection Volume 2 tomorrow?

1386
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,770
Or closer to TGS?

1387
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,070
I...

1388
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,870
I wouldn't...

1389
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,410
Put it out of...

1390
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:18,130
The...

1391
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:18,870
You know...

1392
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,210
For them to talk about it.

1393
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,990
Maybe even announce it.

1394
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,670
If they don't say so much about it.

1395
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:25,530
Hmm.

1396
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,310
God!

1397
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,830
Look at that thing!

1398
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:30,910
It's like hopping!

1399
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:32,830
It's so cute!

1400
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:39,950
Where are the...

1401
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,150
Scarecrow ladies?

1402
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,690
I can't...

1403
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,410
I can't see!

1404
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:46,550
Everything was so fast!

1405
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,330
Oh, I see it like this.

1406
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:55,790
Ugh!

1407
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:57,270
Ugh!

1408
01:13:58,170 --> 01:13:59,350
It's perfect!

1409
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,490
It's so good!

1410
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:05,390
I can't wait!

1411
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,050
I can't wait!

1412
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:12,350
Ugh!

1413
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:16,710
Look, they're like holding the...

1414
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,770
The...

1415
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,050
The blade...

1416
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,410
It's so good!

1417
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,910
Gosh, it's such a good design!

1418
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:27,970
I wonder if it's based off of them because...

1419
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,430
Wait a second...

1420
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,350
This looks like the boy!

1421
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:36,530
Huh...

1422
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:38,030
Like it's the same haircut, you know?

1423
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:39,610
Hmm...

1424
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,870
Hmm...

1425
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,350
I wonder...

1426
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,070
I wonder, I wonder...

1427
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,590
Same uniform...

1428
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,050
Yeah, I wonder if it's like kind of...

1429
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:50,610
Storyline...

1430
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:51,910
We crafted a level...

1431
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:55,770
People experience unique to Silent Hill F.

1432
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:58,110
We believe that for Asian players...

1433
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,530
These Japanese style...

1434
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,690
It's so pretty!

1435
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:03,370
Oh gosh, it's so pretty!

1436
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:04,370
Let's see...

1437
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:06,290
I wanna like...

1438
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:07,070
There was other...

1439
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,290
There was another like...

1440
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:08,990
Or maybe here...

1441
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,450
Sorry...

1442
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,510
I'm skipping through...

1443
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:13,190
He-he!

1444
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:14,250
He-he!

1445
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,170
I can't get over...

1446
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,250
Wait, they even have the uniforms in the office!

1447
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:25,450
This...

1448
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:26,530
That's awesome!

1449
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,410
I guess to see like...

1450
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:30,590
How it would move in certain situations...

1451
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,270
The team spent a lot of time...

1452
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,270
Focusing on creating a combat system...

1453
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,590
That would feel both fresh...

1454
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:37,330
Oh my gosh!

1455
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:38,250
The way they move!

1456
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:39,230
Woohoo!

1457
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,950
Never occurred to me that normal Silent Hill seems normal to us...

1458
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,250
And foreign to Japanese players...

1459
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:48,610
Yeah!

1460
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:49,150
Right!

1461
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:51,350
Yeah!

1462
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:53,930
Like...

1463
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:54,850
Yeah!

1464
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,310
Hmm...

1465
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,950
I never thought about that really either too!

1466
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,010
Oh, that's cool!

1467
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:06,020
I'm concerned it won't have anything to do with...

1468
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,380
Or it will retcon the entire cult and origin stuff with Silent Hill...

1469
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,340
I think...

1470
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,230
I think...

1471
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:22,370
Hmm...

1472
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,870
How to say...

1473
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:29,570
Uh...

1474
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,370
I think it will probably be its...

1475
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,370
Be its own thing...

1476
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,570
But...

1477
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,080
I think...

1478
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,640
How do I say...

1479
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,660
Sorry...

1480
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,680
I'm thinking...

1481
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:58,990
I think for the most part...

1482
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,050
Silent Hill...

1483
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,130
Silent Hill...

1484
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:09,330
I think it can be its own thing...

1485
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:16,970
Cause like...

1486
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:20,530
2 didn't really talk so much about it...

1487
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:21,850
They brought it back in 3...

1488
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,400
But like...

1489
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,220
Crazy take, I know...

1490
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:33,220
Hahaha...

1491
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,580
I think honestly...

1492
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:36,900
My...

1493
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,240
My opinion of...

1494
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:40,360
How...

1495
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,620
Silent Hill is...

1496
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,200
Is like...

1497
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:49,930
This...

1498
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,770
And this is a really Japanese concept...

1499
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,450
Which is...

1500
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:55,890
Is that...

1501
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,530
Hold on...

1502
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,370
Sorry...

1503
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,990
How do I explain the...

1504
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,250
Without sounding like a...

1505
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,630
N...

1506
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:02,550
Nutcase...

1507
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:12,840
If... there are enough strong feelings, a case of Silent Hill can occur.

1508
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,300
Does that make sense?

1509
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:30,490
So like, it's like, okay, you know how like with... with... the... you guys get what I was trying to say?

1510
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:31,310
That's super normal?

1511
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,410
Okay, you get it?

1512
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:32,970
Okay, cool.

1513
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:43,530
Like, it's almost... it's almost like... like with, you know, the grudge, you know, like with Juon.

1514
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:56,770
Where it's just like... they say... they say if enough... if a powerful of enough... grudge happens upon death, then the curse is born, etc, etc.

1515
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:00,210
Yeah, it's not a set location.

1516
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,950
It's kind of like a...

1517
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,810
It's... it's the... it's the...

1518
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,150
You guys get what I'm trying to say?

1519
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,870
I'm just... I'm still waking up.

1520
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,410
More of a state of a mind than a place.

1521
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,910
Miraculous ladybug!

1523
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:26,050
Exactly!

1524
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,970
You get akumatized.

1525
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:36,150
You get akumatized and then you are in Silent Hill.

1526
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,700
Trauma manifestations.

1527
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:43,860
That... yes.

1528
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:44,640
That.

1529
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:51,160
So that's why I'm just like, you know, Silent Hill doesn't have to be like, you know, surrounding this certain...

1530
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,920
entity, the cult or whatever, whatever.

1531
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:55,420
Because, you know...

1532
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,960
That's just one aspect of it.

1533
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,160
So...

1534
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:05,640
We'll see.

1535
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:06,520
We'll see.

1536
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:06,780
We'll see.

1537
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,600
Akumatized into pyramid heads.

1538
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,040
That's horrible.

1539
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,100
What if...

1540
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:13,900
What if...

1541
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,060
What if ladybug is its own form of Silent Hill?

1542
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,960
What if in Paris everybody's...

1543
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,620
It's so...

1544
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:24,240
It's...

1545
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:24,560
It's...

1546
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,600
I've always joked because, like, you know, obviously due to, like, animation and...

1547
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,400
limited budgets and everything, they could only animate so many people.

1548
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,840
But when I was...

1549
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,960
I was really into Ladybug for...

1550
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,980
for a hot minute.

1551
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,580
And, like, me and my friends, we would watch it together.

1552
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:45,220
And we would always joke that there's, like, five people who live in Paris.

1553
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,380
And that just...

1554
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,080
That's just...

1555
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,360
Those are the five people stuck in Paris Hill.

1556
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,120
But they're...

1557
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,620
And constantly getting akumatized.

1558
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,360
I sadly can't vibe with psycho horror games.

1559
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,060
Oh!

1560
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,360
Yeah, I guess...

1561
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,020
Some people...

1562
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,260
It's not some people's type...

1563
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,040
Cup of tea.

1564
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,140
I...

1565
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,100
I love...

1566
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,300
For the most part, any kind of horror.

1567
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,160
I think psychological horror has been...

1568
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,360
way overdone...

1569
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,160
at this point.

1570
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,100
But...

1571
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,280
With Silent Hill...

1572
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,820
At least with this...

1573
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,020
I...

1574
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,180
I trust.

1575
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,140
I trust.

1576
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,780
Maybe I'm a fool for putting in so much trust, but...

1577
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,860
I trust Ryukishi7.

1578
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,300
So...

1579
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:34,860
I don't know.

1580
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,340
Time for me to wake up and go to work.

1581
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,200
Have a good day at work!

1582
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:43,590
I love the vibe.

1583
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:44,010
I love the vibe.

1584
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:45,650
I love the vibe.

1585
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,010
I...

1586
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:51,330
I keep calling it Fatal Frame Silent Hill.

1587
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,550
And if this is the closest I'll get to another Fatal Frame.

1588
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:54,950
Fine.

1589
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:55,950
Fine!

1590
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:59,170
And I'm just gonna talk while it plays so I can see more...

1591
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,450
More spooky things.

1592
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,330
This...

1593
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:02,530
Hold on.

1594
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,350
I noticed this too.

1595
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,980
These eyeballs are so creepy.

1596
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,680
I was talking about like a...

1597
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:11,100
The...

1598
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,960
Uneasiness during this part.

1599
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:13,600
And I was like...

1600
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:13,800
Ew!

1601
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,520
Creepy!

1602
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:18,880
This...

1603
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,900
Gosh!

1604
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,880
It looks so good.

1605
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,280
Ugh!

1606
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,620
I love horror!

1607
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:30,440
I love horror.

1608
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,180
I love horror.

1609
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,540
The choppy movement.

1610
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:36,900
I know.

1611
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,380
Chef's kiss.

1612
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:39,460
So...

1613
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:40,620
So good.

1614
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,120
So, so, so stink.

1615
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,160
And then...

1616
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,520
The...

1617
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:48,490
I'm obsessed!

1618
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:52,050
I'm so obsessed.

1619
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:53,610
I'm so obsessed.

1620
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:55,970
I'm so obsessed.

1621
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:56,490
I'm so obsessed!

1622
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,130
Oh my god.

1623
01:22:58,150 --> 01:22:59,330
I'm so obsessed.

1624
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:07,030
Oh...

1625
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:08,730
Obsessed.

1626
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:14,310
Anyway.

1627
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:16,830
I'm gonna head out now though, guys!

1628
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:18,290
Uh...

1629
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:19,330
I have another stream tonight.

1630
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:22,610
So, if you want more Mito action, I'll see you then.

1631
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:23,630
And if not...

1632
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,090
Hi, Dad!

1633
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,310
Hi, Dad!

1634
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,670
Thanks, Troy, for this!

1635
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,750
I'll see you when I see you next.

1636
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:31,690
He-hee-hee!

1637
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:32,530
Okay!

1638
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,670
Thanks, guys, for watching this with me.

1639
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:35,670
Waking up early.

1640
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:36,930
If you had to wake up early.

1641
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:38,230
And if you didn't, then...

1642
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,450
Thanks for hanging out!

1643
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:40,350
Nyah!

1644
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:40,490
Yeah!

1645
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:45,230
This game isn't called Loud Valley.

1646
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:50,310
Oh, it's not the opposite of Sal- I was like, what's Loud Valley?

1647
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:52,210
Logan!

1648
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:53,150
Thank you so much for the fun.

1649
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:53,950
Good to take you!

1650
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:56,750
Just came home from work.

1651
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:57,350
Might nap.

1652
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:58,730
Good night!

1653
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:00,030
Bye-bye!

1654
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:00,810
Bye-bye!

1655
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:02,150
Thank you, guys!

1656
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,210
See you!

1657
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:04,410
Bye-bye!

1658
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:05,130
Bye-bye!

1659
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:06,610
I'm gonna go take a nap.
