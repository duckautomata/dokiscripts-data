1
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,780

Yeah!

5
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,340
You guys like my witches hat?

6
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,100
Um, I thought, wait, not I thought.

7
00:04:50,240 --> 00:06:14,820
um hold on wait my words i today today today before i before i before i get so uh why am i so twisty tied today why am i so twisty i don't know how to words anymore um i uh thank you whimsy so much for the five gifted uh today i'll be playing a couple briefly because it's like i have no set one thing i'm doing i feel like i have so many things i'm doing i i i um i will be playing uh a couple random horror games today right now is uh what's it called oh my gosh next fest on steam which is like you get a bunch of they just they there's a bunch of demos and um you know i've and other people before play like random indie horror game kind of type things and i was like oh well i've always wanted to do that like maybe from itchio um or something like that but um i thought maybe this would also be a good chance to try some other types of games because they're like demos so we'll know for sure that they're not too long and i think i got a couple of interesting

8
00:06:19,680 --> 00:07:40,840
um they should all work hopefully um but i just wanted to start getting into some spooky games because it's october and so i really wanted to play some spooky stuff and well oh my gosh originally i was just like if i play a bunch of random games i can cross off a bunch of you know maybe three or four games or something um off my list of games i need to beat but because these are all demos i guess that doesn't count huh i guess i kind of screwed myself out of that thinking yeah demos don't count boo that's okay though that's okay we're just here to have fun and if we like the games one of them for sure i kind of want to play not kind of i do want to play um because it's the first game we'll be playing some of you guys might recognize some of these games or at least yeah you might not the games but i'm not gonna play granny i'm not but you know what i like to watch is granny speed runs i like watching granny speed runs they're so funny but um yeah so um i'm not taking requests for games

9
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:49,560
though because i already have the ones that i have downloaded And if they don't work for whatever reason, I'm just going to go find something else off of Steam, another demo.

10
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,040
So that horror slop game.

11
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,420
You guys know Granny, right?

12
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,580
It's like, how do you describe?

13
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,340
I feel like there was like a type of game that spawned.

14
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,400
You know how games spawned from like PT and FNAF, like similar games.

15
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,500
Happy Thanksgiving in Canada.

16
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,600
Happy Thanksgiving in Canada!

17
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,460
I feel like a granny also spawned a certain kind of game.

18
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,380
But I don't know what it's called.

19
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,540
Mobile horror.

20
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,840
Escape room type horror.

21
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,080
That sounds correct.

22
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,720
So basically granny is like one of those games.

23
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,140
It's a game where you are in this grandma's house.

24
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:41,360
And you have to kind of do like escape room type puzzles to escape grandma.

25
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,300
And there's multiple ways to escape.

26
00:08:44,320 --> 00:09:29,900
and like you'll be like oh i go downstairs and i find a screwdriver and the screwdriver unlocks this and that gives me a battery and then i put the battery in this and what are those types of games where it's like a step by step but the the the uh items are randomized so you know the screwdriver won't always be in the same place it's kind of got like a bit a level of replayability and every noise you make like if you accidentally if you like unlock a thing granny will hear it kind of thing kind of like that neighbor game yes yes yes yes yes it's like that wow what was that called I don't remember time to ask the age old question BA polls good

27
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:57,170
anyway anyway hello neighbor yeah so um but that we're not playing granny today that game stresses me out too i like it's one of those games i like watching people play it but i don't want to play it because i'm gonna be like

28
00:10:01,330 --> 00:11:10,580

All right.

32
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,560
We're doing it live.

33
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,740
We're doing it live.

34
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,260
You might hear the game first.

35
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,740
Oh, wow.

36
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,140
What the hell?

37
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,320
Why is it?

38
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,860
Why is the resolution?

39
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,540
Oh, things are loading in the screen.

40
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,020
As I'm...

41
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,220

Oh, there is an options for it.

46
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,040
You know what?

47
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm just gonna keep it as...

48
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,860
Wait, no.

49
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,260
I'm gonna turn off.

50
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,680
Maybe not.

51
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,260
Do nothing in Ultra.

52
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,260
Also, frame rate...

53
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,620
Limit.

54
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,620
Limit.

55
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,740
Limit?

56
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,020
Limit.

57
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,960
There should be a limit?

58
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,980
Oh, whoa.

59
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,520
Okay.

60
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,520
It says what?

61
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,960
We have zero frames.

62
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,020
FPS?

63
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:38,620
FPS means frames per sometimes I guess 60 why is it a slider that's that's the good question let's see um we'll just go with this for now apply control we'll just we'll see how it goes have my birthday last weekend Now I'm celebrating it tonight with my wife.

64
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,540
Serval!

65
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,540
Happy birthday!

66
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,100
Fancy stew!

67
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,020
So this is a demo, everybody.

68
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
Please keep in mind that all these games are demos.

69
00:13:47,960 --> 00:14:01,620
So if they are, you know, of the scuffed variety, if they're a little, you know, if they're not as polished, we're not going to be so judgmental because they are demos.

70
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:37,640
And that's kind of also why I wanted to choose demos rather than like some uh like some of the shorter indie horror games because you know if like you know i try not to be so negative when someone is making a game i can't i don't know how to do that they're they're doing better than i am so yeah we'll we'll but if something's real bad we could say it's bad because it's a demo yeah i can't judge i can't make game i mean either objective get to school with my No,

71
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,060
no, no, no, catch fish, selfish, refuel.

72
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,880
That's how we get to school?

73
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,120
Fast travel.

74
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,140
Oh, my gosh.

75
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,820
We have a green conch.

76
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Oh, I took it.

77
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,980
And it gave me 100 yen.

78
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,500
It's...

79
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,120
What the hell?

80
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,260
Wait a second.

81
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,160
We have, like, forest gump over here.

82
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,780
200 yen.

83
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,000
We can run.

84
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:23,020
300 yen this feels so not chill as art 400 yen this is actually so interesting from their normal stuff i wonder where the vtubers are

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:40,290

86
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,510
He's become what he sells.

87
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,810
He's so scary.

88
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,310
Welcome.

89
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:47,470
What?

90
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,810
This looks so different from like regulars chillas are.

91
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,510
Am I crazy?

92
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,350
Back in my day we had to catch sharks and sell them to pay for bus tickets to get to school.

93
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,650
Oh, you're out hunting?

94
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,110
Very nice.

95
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,950
If you catch something here and leave it on the boat, I'll buy it.

96
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,650
Don't drive rough though, the fish will fall out.

97
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:39,410
you'll only find pufferfish here but I've seen big ones pulled up from these waters before bring me the goodies and I'll upgrade your boatie my boatie you'll be out there in no time am I going to school what how old am I bring me a load all right oh wow there's Wow okay harpoon range boat speed we are upgrading and selling.

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:40,630
Okay.

100
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,190
Interesting.

101
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,030
And then our Noriba.

102
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,770
So if I...

103
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,630
You think I'll get something big?

104
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,010
No.

105
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,990
Wait, what's that?

106
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,630
More money.

107
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,630
Wait, what if I...

108
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,590
Oh, I can swim.

109
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,590
Fish!

110
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:05,750
Fish!

111
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,010
I also can just breathe underwater.

112
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,790
This is the most effective way of being a fisherman.

113
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:17,910
Nice hat.

114
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,610
Thank you.

115
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,310
Happy Halloween, everybody.

116
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,750
Oh, I got it.

117
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,390
I got it.

118
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,810
That's not a puffer fish.

119
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,430
I think he lied.

120
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,370
I feel kind of bad for him.

121
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,230
Okay, here's my alive fish.

122
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,630
Brought some.

123
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,230
Let me see.

124
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,710
Uh, I did?

125
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,790
I think.

126
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,710
How do I...

127
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,910
What do I do with this guy?

128
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,790
I could drop him.

129
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,490
Oh my god, he's humongous!

130
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,770
Oh my gosh!

131
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,910
I've just been casually...

132
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,550
Oh my god!

133
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,590
I don't think he's alive anymore.

134
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,630
Put it in my box.

135
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,550
How do I do that?

136
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,380
Oh, I have to put it in the boat, he said, maybe.

137
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,240
Is that it?

138
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,380
Get on boat.

139
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,380
Oh, selling.

140
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,240
Place your catch inside the green frame to sell it.

141
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,760
Ah, items not placed in the frame will disappear after a while.

142
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,720
Okay, okay, okay.

143
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,260
Oh, look at me cow.

144
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
I think he's wrong.

145
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,020
It's not just puffer fish.

146
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,500
Whoa!

147
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,200
What's out over there?

148
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,980
Giant windmills.

149
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,560
Well, there's lots of fish here.

150
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,720
Wait, are these the puff- oh, these must be the puffer fish.

151
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,240
Ah!

152
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,700
Oh, dang!

153
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,200
I think I got him.

154
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,880
I don't think that guy is alive anymore.

155
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,720
Are you guys feeling spooky?

156
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,740
Oh, he's all puffed up.

157
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,780
I want to go out boating and stuff.

158
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,040
Wait, how does it sell?

159
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:23,940
Hmm.

160
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,540
I got a big guy.

161
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,360
First try.

162
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,600
Oh.

163
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,040
Did you guys... Oh, I passed out.

164
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,920
Oh, my gosh.

165
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,660
I was about to say, do you guys have the salacisophobia?

166
00:19:42,500 --> 00:20:18,390
Yeah, I keep thinking of that pufferfish, like, sound the oh you know that guy's glowing fear of open waters yeah yeah yeah holy cow oh my gosh what are these guys eating wait there's an island over there another one and then what's over here oh nothing can i sell you you now ah here we go here we go Sell.

167
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,530
Oh, select all.

168
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,010
Sell.

169
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,250
Today's my birthday.

170
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:22,990
Call it.

171
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,710
Happy birthday.

172
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,450
Being awesome at introducing me to Dave the Diver and Dredge.

173
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,150
I love fishing games like this.

174
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,550
Okay, we sold fish.

175
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,950
Now we refuel.

176
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,430
Oh, okay.

177
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,750
Expensive.

178
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,410
Okay, we go to school.

179
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,750
Where the hell is school?

180
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,430
School is not on the map.

181
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,190
I'm guessing it's that over there, no?

182
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,050
What if I get trapped in the middle of the ocean?

183
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,190
Look at the size of these things!

184
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,110
Oh.

185
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,110
What?

186
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,430
What's peeping?

187
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,930
Low fuel!

188
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,290
Okay, I think I gotta sell more stuff.

189
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,090
We're not gonna make it.

190
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,870
We're not gonna make it!

191
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,550
Am I doing the sound?

192
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:40,180
right oh like the puffer fish oh oh okay we need to get some more big boys this guy is ripe for the picking hey this guy took my kill okay wait can i do no only one at a time

193
00:21:45,850 --> 00:22:04,670

194
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:20,750
our goldfish our pufferfish like goldfish and that like you know how like some goldfish will grow to be super big like they kind of grow to the size of their bowl tank.

195
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,030
I wonder if Pufferfish are the same.

196
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,290
Okay, so we should probably fill up our tank.

197
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,230
Let's try and get... Oh, this guy over... Oh, that freaks me out every time.

198
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,310
Let's try and get this guy over here.

199
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:40,650
Ah!

200
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,530
Huh?

201
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,200
Okay.

202
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,950
There, this guy.

203
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,470
Dang.

204
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,380
I like how I basically have to be in the water, though, to catch these fish.

205
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,720
Um, can I go out just a little bit further?

206
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,460
Alright, we might black out.

207
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,800
The sun is in my eyes.

208
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,480
But the wind is...

209
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,580
My sails...

210
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,320
Wait, the fish is in my heart.

211
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,520
Ha!

212
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
You know, like, the wind is in my sails.

213
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,260
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

214
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,840
Don't...

215
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,080
You sucker!

216
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,440
What?

217
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,980
Because, well, I'm trying to say that I can do it.

218
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,760
I don't know, I don't know, I actually didn't even see how much he sold for.

219
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,820
Hello.

220
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,960
They don't sell for very much.

221
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,340
Isn't, like, Fugu a delicacy?

222
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,260
I think many people will pay top dollar for these fine, fine pufferfish.

223
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,660
Oh my god.

224
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,070
The tuna was like 70?

225
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,330
Oh, so even less?

226
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,710
Ah, okay.

227
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,130
Maybe we don't want him then.

228
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,150
Oh, one of them was 750!

229
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,670
Ah, okay.

230
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,150
Maybe it was him then.

231
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,990
We do want this guy.

232
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,230
Okay, I'm gonna try.

233
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,330
We might black out.

234
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,070
Okay, we blacked out.

235
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,970
Alright, I know the point of no return.

236
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,310
Yeah, we got him, we got him!

237
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,410
Ooh.

238
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,570
Whoa.

239
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,390
Whoa.

240
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,590
Alright, don't flop out.

241
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,070
Oh my gosh, he's really...

242
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,030
He's really big.

243
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:00,770
Ah!

244
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,670
Wait!

245
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,360
What's up?

246
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,320
Um, guys, I think I broke the game.

247
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,720
Guys, I think I broke the game.

248
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,820
Oh, we got it, we got it, we got it, we got it.

249
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,020
I think?

250
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,260
We do have him, right?

251
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,240
I was just trying to get him in this spot.

252
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,620
So he doesn't despa- Okay, let's go sell it.

253
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,600
Let's see if he sells.

254
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,520
Please, please.

255
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
A thousand!

256
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,720
That's less than ten bucks.

257
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,280
Nice.

258
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh, nice shot, Minto.

259
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,900
Thanks, Minto.

260
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,500
Oh, this is tiny.

261
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,160
Tiny, tiny guy.

262
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,800
Okay.

263
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,400
They can't all be winners, I suppose.

264
00:25:59,460 --> 00:25:59,880
Uh-oh.

265
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,060
We eventually do have to play the other game, so I can't spend all my time fishing.

266
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,360
But what if?

267
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,740
This guy is...

268
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,460
I can't get over how big these fish are.

269
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,740
They're so large.

270
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,600
Or can you?

271
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,740
Alright, what I'm gonna do is also...

272
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,720
This is a horror game.

273
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,260
It is.

274
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,780
What if I fast...

275
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,480
Hajimari... Oh, okay.

276
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm guessing Hajimari Island is over there.

277
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,080
Do you guys see that?

278
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,240
You guys see that, right?

279
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,500
Oh.

280
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,920
What is that?

281
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,260
Oh.

282
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,920
That's a big boy.

283
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,480
Wait, he's like so close, though.

284
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
That's a big, big boy.

285
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,080
Wait, we can go see him.

286
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,960
All right, max fuel.

287
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,880
Alright, bye!

288
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,640
There he is.

289
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,060
What if I...

290
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,420
He's kind of fast though.

291
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,400
But what if I catch him?

292
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,620
Okay, let's uh, let's go this way instead.

293
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,720
Let's go to the other island.

294
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,040
Oh!

295
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,800
You can open or close the map with the M key.

296
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,700
This is already... this doesn't feel like a Chillizard game, does it?

297
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,650
I kind of want to keep fishing!

298
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,510
Look at this!

299
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,470
What's this?

300
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,690
Emergency button.

301
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,250
Leave your cargo here and return to the last gas station you visited, okay?

302
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,070
Oh, whoops.

303
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,090
How do I cancel?

304
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,070
Wait.

305
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,290
Cancel.

306
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,150
Cancel?

307
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,350
Oh, space.

308
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,030
My bad.

309
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,250
I don't want to jump in because I'm afraid I will pass out.

310
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,430
I guess it would just put me back on the boat.

311
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,170
Where'd that big tuna go?

312
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,010
Oh, well.

313
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,850
Where'd that other big guy go?

314
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,290
Spooky, spooky, scary.

315
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,510
Oh, wait.

316
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,090
Yeah!

317
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,890
Come here.

318
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,390
You're mine.

319
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,990
And it said don't go too fast.

320
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,050
Holy cow!

321
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,630
Or the fish drop out.

322
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,190
And we need them to have a good education.

323
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,010
They can't be dropping out of school.

324
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,810
to have good grades.

325
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,210
Nice shot.

326
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,990
Thank you.

327
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:06,830
Oh.

328
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,110
It's a...

329
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,810
A shrine?

330
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,080
Whoa.

331
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
Ah, half fuel.

332
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,900
Okay, thank you.

333
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,450
Hello?

334
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,000
Girl in school uniform.

335
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,800
She's cute!

336
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,460
She's so cute!

337
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,940
I have to get to the island.

338
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,900
I have to end the curse before I...

339
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,960
Before what?

340
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,800
Someone has to do it.

341
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,460
Will you please help me get to the island?

342
00:29:59,640 --> 00:29:59,820

350
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,680
She's gonna fish out, you guys.

351
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,220
It's kind of relaxing here, though.

352
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,100
How'd you get out here?

353
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,800
Hmm.

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,410
All right, it's not free.

376
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,150
Don't don't don't get it twisted.

377
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,550

00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:46,650
giant.

434
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,490
How am I only getting a thousand yen for this stuff?

435
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,130
I swear, someone's ripping me off, for real.

436
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,950
I see this... Okay, so it says we're like right on the island.

437
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,650
Maybe I need to go here a little bit.

438
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,370
Some of these aren't working.

439
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,210
Or the treasure, rather.

440
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,830
I guess it's not quite an island.

441
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm scared of what the horror is going to be like in this game.

442
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,060

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,620
Half fuel.

446
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,380
We're okay.

447
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,760
Treasure?

448
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,660
Huh?

449
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,640

450
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,740
I'm a hero!

451
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,020
There's another one!

452
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,870
Wait, is this blood or...

453
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,110
But it looks like this one has something on the other...

454
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,060
Okay.

455
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,380
Sure is starting to look very silent.

456
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,040
Hill in here.

457
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,820
What's that?

458
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,240
Oh, that's the big fish.

459
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,340
Wait.

460
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,680
Come back, big fish.

461
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,800
Come back, big fish.

462
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,760
Okay, he's kind of fast.

463
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
Alright, we gotta save this one too.

464
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,600
I'm a hero.

465
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,340
I'm a hero.

466
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,530
Yeah, there's a fish up there.

467
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:38,690
Hey!

468
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,650
Mind the fuel.

469
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,850
Yeah, we'll be okay, I think.

470
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,850
Yeah!

471
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,770
Is that guy mine?

472
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,710
How do you get speared so perfectly like that?

473
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,310
Where's the treasure?

474
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,050
Did I get scammed?

475
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,550
She wouldn't.

476
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,150
I've known her for all of two minutes, but surely she wouldn't.

477
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,490
Oh, dang it.

478
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,170
Spear the fish?

479
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:19,970
Yeah, I'm trying.

480
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,370
We'll get her next time, boys.

481
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,230
Why is...

482
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,950
Why are other...

483
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,090
Why?

484
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,930
I have questions.

485
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,150
Ah!

486
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,210

487
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,690
Oh.

488
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:40,790

496
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,090
White circle in the water.

00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,850

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,170
Am I going the right way?

505
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,980

516
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,080
Wait, spearmint would be kind of great for a name.

517
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,140
Spearmint for your guitar.

518
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,630

527
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:37,770
Sell.

528
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:38,790
Select all.

529
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,430
Sell.

530
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:39,850
Okay.

531
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:40,630
Let's go.

532
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,930
To further ventures.

533
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:47,670
So I'm going to go.

534
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,570
Am I going the right way?

535
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,910
Kind of.

536
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,870
We need to go a little more this way, I believe.

537
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,030
Yes, okay.

538
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:54,690
Onwards!

539
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,770
Chill with the J word.

540
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,890
You're scaring me.

541
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,550
Sorry.

542
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:07,250
Sorry, I'm supposed to be a channel where you forget your responsibilities.

543
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,980
And here I am bringing up such terrible concepts.

544
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,180
Don't even worry.

545
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,600
pretty little head, okay?

546
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,100
Wow, this is far!

547
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,700
Are we gonna make it?

548
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,300
Spearminto!

549
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,200
Sounds awesome!

550
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,540
Thank you very much, Pinto fellows.

551
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:31,900
Yeah!

552
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,600
Enjoy your guitar!

553
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,020
Okay, I don't think we can be distracted by anything.

554
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,520
No distractions!

555
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,860
We are on course to the location.

556
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,500
I'm already here.

557
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,180
Ah!

558
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,900
No distractions.

559
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,940
That's an animal.

560
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,140
Do you think we'll make it?

561
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,340
I guess we'll see.

562
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,480
Leviathan.

563
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:12,880
I know.

564
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,560
I feel like I'm playing dredge all over again.

565
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,880
You will not.

566
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,240
What?

567
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,980
Have faith!

568
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:22,840
Have faith!

569
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,500
Have faith!

570
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
We'll just keep going forward!

571
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:59,620

572
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,040
I'm about to pass out.

573
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,220
I'm about to black out.

574
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:04,980
Please.

575
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,320
I was right here.

576
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,270
You son of a bitch.

577
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,350
You.

578
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,610
We are so close, you guys.

579
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,370
That sucks.

580
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:19,710
Okay.

581
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,230
We have to get more upgrades.

582
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:27,610
Luckily, that's why I also didn't catch anything, because I was like, I'm not gonna waste my time.

583
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:30,110
Need one more upgrade.

584
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,530
Yep.

585
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,810
Okay, Chillas aren't so stingy.

586
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:39,880
Hello!

587
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,360
Oh, there you are.

588
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,040
I don't know how I managed to get that, but...

589
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,620
This is a Chillas game?

590
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,340
It is!

591
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,580
Isn't that crazy?

592
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,440
Honestly, I feel like I could play this just the whole...

593
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,760
Oh, okay.

594
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,380
Let me sell them real quick.

595
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,180
Okay.

596
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,020
Oh, yeah!

597
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,420
Wait, okay, so upgrade, fuel capacity.

598
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,260
I'm gonna upgrade the speed as well.

599
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,040
So let's get a couple more.

600
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,440
But yeah, this is a Chillas Arc game.

601
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,300
That's why I was so interested in it, because I'm like, oh my gosh.

602
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,340
It's a fish game.

603
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,600
It's a fish horror game.

604
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,460
And also...

605
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,220
Dang, not that far away.

606
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,900
Um, it's so different from what they usually put out.

607
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,900
I was very interested, you know.

608
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,340
Yeah.

609
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:53,770
There's one game that I am excited to try to, though, that I downloaded earlier that I think will be kind of funny.

610
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,210
So, we'll see what it's like.

611
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,970
Um, so...

612
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:01,690
That's it.

613
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,310
500?

614
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,910
Okay, we need still another 500 to get to...

615
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:14,010
upgrade to get the last upgrade we need but i don't want to be like on zero money so we'll get a couple more tuna

616
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:36,610
okay where were the backer cameos that's what i was wondering i was wondering where the i should probably put like what game we're playing i'll link them below in the description uh after stream since it's a variety of stuff.

617
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,530
I had a nickel for every fishing horror game that you played where capitalism is a true horror and I'm zero nickels being no!

618
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,350
Your nickels!

619
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,130
Oh yeah, I have no fuel too, so we need to fill up.

620
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,530
We need to fill up, fill up, fill up, baby.

621
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:55,350
Alright.

622
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,470
Alright, let's catch a couple of these guys because they're all right here too, you know.

623
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,750
more money

624
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:14,950
holy cow god oh my gosh sucks for anybody who hates fish and plays this game you know

625
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:35,750
like i understand the fear like the the the phasophobia fear you know not phasmophobia but like the fear of open water because like Like, you're swimming, and there could be a really big fish underneath your feet, and you would never know.

626
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:37,750
Like, at the same time.

627
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,160
Oh, this is kind of nice, but we need to fill up.

628
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,920
At the same time, I don't know.

629
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,220
Just kind of, the ocean's kind of relaxing to me.

630
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:52,980
Yippee!

631
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,400
Okay, now we can go.

632
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,200
On the road again.

633
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,480
I can't wait to be on the road again.

634
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,320
Does the fish fear you?

635
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,320
Oh, yeah.

636
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,100
Can you also link your October Limited merch?

637
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,240
Haven't seen the link?

638
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,440
Yeah.

639
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,380
Oh, I have to find the link.

640
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:16,520
Sorry.

641
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,360
I'm so bad at merch.

642
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,340
Waking up to Lilac Mint.

643
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,040
I wipe my brow, and I sweat my what?

644
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,140
Are you okay?

645
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,940
Are you half asleep?

646
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,200
This game scares me because I can't swim.

647
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,980
to learn how to swim, Phil.

648
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,980
Knowing how to swim is so important, you guys.

649
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,180
Don't pass up learning how to swim.

650
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,400
Hi, Minto.

651
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,580
Oh, hio.

652
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,460
Wait, we're already half-fueled?

653
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,380
Oh, but we're, like, closer.

654
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,340
Maybe.

655
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,250
You never know when you need to know how to swim, too.

656
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,690
It's, like, super duper important.

657
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:04,630
Okay.

658
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,660
Sorry, I thought I heard something.

659
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,220
I heard like a creek on my boat.

660
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,140
My bathtub does not scare me.

661
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,720
I know how to swim, yes I do.

662
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,220
I did not die by drowning.

663
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,460
What is that?

664
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,400
That's a fast fish.

665
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:30,940
What is that?

666
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,400
He looks like he's worth a lot of money.

667
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,680
I'll take you.

668
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,160

I think we technically made it.

674
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,480
I'm just gonna hop the fence.

675
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,890
Okay, I think we've found the horror maybe.

676
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:56,650
Wait, there's a person up there.

677
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,410
I made it to school!

678
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,470
This really is what happens after weathering with you.

679
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,070
It's actually so peaceful, though.

680
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:19,430
Except all the fish Are girls No, we don't think it's a witch or the pit, thank you

681
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,460
What's that sound?

682
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:34,290
Oh, no, this is scary I don't like that I don't like that one bit What is this?

684
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:48,810
Oh, it's just fish.

685
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,350
They look a little aggressive, though, no?

686
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:53,170
Ah!

687
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:54,530
Okay.

688
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:56,450
Chill out, chill out!

689
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:59,670
Class is in session!

690
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,510
They zoom in, yeah.

691
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,550
But wait, with the wind chimes, it's so nice.

692
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:12,650
This feels kind of nice.

693
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:40,890
the lighting is pretty freaky it's freaking me out a little bit it's like nice and scary at the same time we gotta go talk to this guy whoever he is i can't believe this is a chillas art game i'm like actually so like the desks in a circle okay scary like they've come so far from their previous games

694
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,460
This is like so scary and so relaxing at the same time.

695
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,180
I don't know...

696
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,040
You know when you're like scared and turned on?

697
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,980
That's how I feel right now.

698
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,340
But not turned on.

699
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,720
Just relax.

700
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,520
It's kind of like a conflicting, you know, feeling.

701
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,310
Ready for clash?

702
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:12,650

It's my birthday!

704
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,210
Leia, happy birthday!

705
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:20,130
Happy birthday!

706
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:21,670
Thank you so much for the super chat.

707
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,580
Ah, here we go.

708
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,200
Wait.

709
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,740
What is that of...

710
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,700
What is that of big...

711
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,320
What was that actually?

712
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,560
Was that I don't know what that...

713
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,100
Guys?

714
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,100
Okay.

715
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,440
Guys?

716
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,100
Look at all that money he's hoarding.

717
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,380
Um...

718
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,060
Okay.

719
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,880
Can I get him?

720
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,800
Let's try.

721
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:04,980
Oh.

722
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,500
Dang.

723
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,280
I don't think so.

724
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,280
No, I can't.

725
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,060
Once again, that feeling, you know what I was just talking about?

726
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,360
Like, can we get to him from up here?

727
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:22,920
No!

728
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,140
Stinking way!

729
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,360
Okay, wait.

730
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,000
Let's go talk to this guy first.

731
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,460
We're gonna get his ass.

732
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,580
And I'm gonna sell him.

733
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,340
Look at all this money?

734
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:39,440
Wait.

735
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,080
These are people's things.

736
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,140
Ah!

737
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,720
Oh, gosh!

738
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:48,480
Oh,

739
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,420
I am reborn.

740
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
God didn't abandon me.

741
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,780
There were bullies in my class.

742
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,980
because I was always watching them from the fish tank.

743
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,160
Some classmates were kind to me.

744
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,620
They even fed me through the glass.

745
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,180
But the bullies tormented the ones who cared for me.

746
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,220
I'm part of the class too.

747
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,040
I'll make sure those jerks are dealt with.

748
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,320
You see the desks in front of me?

749
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:20,900
Yeah.

750
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,780
They're the accessories the bullies wear.

751
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,020
Can I take their stall for?

752
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,980
Guys, I think this game's...

753
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:47,040
a little freaky i'm afraid though i think i'm so out of fuel we won't be able to make it to the gas station even though i've gone here we'll we'll keep exploring and then we'll pass out

754
00:55:51,500 --> 00:56:11,240
so there's so much happening in this game the world is flooded and girls people are turning into fish and fish are turning into people and everything is confusing wait oops

755
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,000
that's awkward nobody saw that

756
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,480
i don't think i can shoot it

757
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,720
he must want you to go back and harpoon bullies maybe

758
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:52,440
oh i thought the wind chime stopped for a second Again, I was about to be like, uh-oh.

759
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,820
Did I make somebody angry?

760
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,540
Dog?

761
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:01,600
Fish?

762
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,640
Oh, more...

763
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,600
More monies.

764
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,540
I feel like the game sometimes gets a little frame rate kind of ugly, sorry.

765
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,600
Maybe I harpoon the bullies and, like, put them here?

766
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,160
Huh.

767
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,360
Alright, well, let's go, um...

768
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,520
Uh, let's go pass out, I guess.

769
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,540
Please let me make it to the...

770
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:35,800
Oops!

771
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,200
Oh, okay, that's worked.

772
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:37,660
That works.

773
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:38,600
Please!

774
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,020
And there we go.

775
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,360
Off-grid!

776
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,220
Chilla's art!

777
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,460
You're so stingy!

778
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,640
These guys only give me, like, 200 yen.

779
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,050
Oh, my goodness.

780
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,970
They're like, you're getting your money's worth from this demo.

781
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:17,250
It's free!

782
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,050
The demo is free!

783
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:22,830
Oh!

784
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,730
Oh, dang it, sorry.

785
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,780
Weeks of fun!

786
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,200
Wait.

787
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:36,920
Am I lost?

788
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,760
Where's the...

789
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,060
No.

790
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,920
Yeah, the tuna should be there.

791
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,360
Okay.

792
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,360
I think there was something closer on the radar.

793
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,800
Like the...

794
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,980
Fueling place?

795
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,000
I don't know.

796
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,720
The radar only shows me fish.

797
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,420
Wait, my GPS, though.

798
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,520
Did that...

799
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,560
Did we lose everything?

800
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,460
I picked up a GPS, didn't I?

801
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,620
Do I have...

802
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,540
Did I lose everything?

803
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,220
No Akasupa's in this game, only floundering.

804
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,760
Fish.

805
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,100
You only have...

806
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,200
few things I enjoy in life.

807
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,400
Fishing, fishing, and minto.

808
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,060
Who is also fishing.

809
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,800
Yeah, we are.

810
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,520
Yeah, we do that.

811
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,040
I think I'm too far.

812
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:32,400
Oh!

813
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,140
No, I might be a genius!

814
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,920
She's the greatest fisher of this generation.

815
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,000
There's the big guy!

816
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,660
That big lad.

817
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,420

820
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:32,190

821
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:32,890
Purple?

822
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,850
Wait, purple?

823
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,290
What?

824
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:34,570
Purple?

825
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:35,230
Purple?

826
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:37,490
Huh?

827
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,130
Wait, huh?

828
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,850
Suddenly purple?

829
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:45,210
Purple?

830
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,730
I'm purple!

831
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:47,650
Purple?

832
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,390
No distractions?

833
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,330
Oh my gosh.

834
01:00:54,210 --> 01:01:02,330
I need to stop slowing down because I think that also, like, lowers my life decimated by ghosts.

835
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:06,490
What's the orpul?

836
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,380
What's the red button do?

837
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,480
It's like an emergency button where if you...

838
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:22,820
Yeah.

839
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:24,460
That.

840
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,880
Big fish.

841
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,520
Big fish.

842
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,400
No distractions.

843
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,860
We're already halfway, guys.

844
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,250
I see you.

845
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,370
I see you.

846
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:50,450
Landhole!

847
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,010
Where was the school at?

848
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,450
You just need to not go to the school.

849
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,510
Wait, I think I'm in the right direction.

850
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:00,450
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

851
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,210
Okay, okay!

852
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,510
It was just me being bad at the game.

853
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,990
What a surprise!

854
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,430
No, no, don't say that.

855
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,810
Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that, don't say that.

856
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,010
We're almost there.

857
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:17,470
We're like, we're so close.

858
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:21,830
Please, please, please don't, please, let me live!

859
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,560
I think I need to...

860
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,760
Oh, we did it!

861
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,200
Uh, dock.

862
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,140
We did it!

863
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:41,030
Gas, gas, gas.

864
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,250
Maybe this guy has more upgrades.

865
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,010
Oh, so you managed to get here.

866
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,650
Way to go!

867
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:48,570
Rasm, let me see.

868
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,090
No.

869
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,550
Oh, no, he doesn't either.

870
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,410
Okay, I guess there will be more upgrades.

871
01:02:52,430 --> 01:03:14,690
in the demo or in the full game but because demo very limited okay so there's no crouch in here in this so I can't go into the store it doesn't seem like there's anything in there anyway maybe in the full game oh oh that's kind of

872
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:19,470
That's kind of freaky.

873
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:20,590
That's kind of freaky.

874
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:23,150
Does this...

875
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:23,470
Wait.

876
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:26,910
What's that on fire over there?

877
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,190
Does this sell for anything?

878
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:35,450
Fish heck.

879
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,630
Heck yeah!

880
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:38,610
Nice.

881
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:41,750
Is that my old boat?

882
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,350
Now we can travel safely because...

883
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,530
Wait, they just left it there?

884
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,790
No, there's somebody else on...

885
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:55,990
Nope.

886
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,190
My old...

887
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,530
My old boat?

888
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:00,610
Oh my gosh, wait!

889
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,190
My girlfriend's still there!

890
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,110
Are you okay?

891
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,350
Okay, now we take her...

892
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:07,970
onto this boat.

893
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,030
Okay, cool.

894
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:15,210
Do all the fish around here have Seifuku?

895
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:18,630
Because if so, this is the best game ever!

896
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:20,850
Oh.

897
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:24,210
Don't be shy, baby girl.

898
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:27,710
Um.

899
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,230
I see some on my radar.

900
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:33,770
Do I need to...

901
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,010
I don't think I can get in the water.

902
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:35,590
Oh, wait.

903
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,030
Oops.

904
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,250
We're living on the edge.

905
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,030
I think that's one right there.

906
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,170
I'm going off instinct.

907
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:44,390
Pure instinct.

908
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:45,230
Failed me.

909
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,730
But I see one over there.

910
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,330
Oh.

911
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:53,950
This one?

912
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,870
Uh...

913
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:59,430
What the...

914
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,650
Who bought you that?

915
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:05,530
Uh-huh.

916
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:13,490
So, now what is the orpul about?

917
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:14,110
You know?

918
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:16,530
Interesting.

919
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,950
This game is so fascinating to me already.

920
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,490
I'm so, like, curious about everything right now.

921
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,380
This guy also has an ugly shirt.

922
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,940
Clearly the Seifuku fish are the most desirable.

923
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,270
I can't believe my ship is here.

924
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,030
That's so funny.

925
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,040
I don't know what else to do though.

926
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,520
Again it just says go to school.

927
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,520
We did that though.

928
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,220
No?

929
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,320
Didn't we?

930
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,280
Like we totally went to school.

931
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,140
Is this not school?

932
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,760
Oh, it's on my fish.

933
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:12,570
Tibid, timid fish.

934
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,930
Hi, lilac mint.

935
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:16,610
Hello.

936
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:22,250
How do I know how to get the bullies, though?

937
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:23,310
You think they're...

938
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,310
You think they're like...

939
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,110
The ones in the classrooms?

940
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,450
Or something?

941
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,770
Can I get in the water here?

942
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:41,170
Oops.

943
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,730
Same accessories as the ones on the...

944
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:47,810
Oh, true!

945
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:49,610
True, true, true.

946
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:50,250
Let's try.

947
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,040
Did you hear that?

948
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,120
Um.

949
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:00,480
Wait.

950
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,760
The door is an opening?

951
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,820
I can't tell if it has an accessory or not.

952
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,720
I'll just drop it.

953
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,460
Oh, he's dead.

954
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,900
It has clothes on, I think.

955
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:30,380
Maybe it's that one that is lit up.

956
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:31,740
That would make sense, huh?

957
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,120
Oh, yeah, it is!

958
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:36,460
It is!

959
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:36,940
It is!

960
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,630
Oh my god.

961
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:01,890
My boat on fire in the distance!

962
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,210
It's so ominous!

963
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,530
happens when we get all the bullies then.

964
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:17,530
I noticed the ones glowing earlier and I was kind of just like...

965
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,490
Oops.

966
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,430
I was like...

967
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,850
I couldn't tell if it was the lighting or not, you know?

968
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,110
Oh my gosh, she's so fast.

969
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,890
Okay, we got her.

970
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,670
Why does the door close on me?

971
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,130
It's kind of annoying, actually.

972
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,570
I feel like it's setting me up for some sort of jump scare.

973
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:44,710
as fast as me though exactly so

974
01:08:50,210 --> 01:09:17,430
are they people or were they fish and fish turning into people everything is so mysterious right now did I do this classroom I think so these guys seem fine they're not so frantic why am I a human why are there some humans these

975
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:26,730
guys are a little freaky oh wait i think that's okay maybe in here

976
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:41,850
no we're looking we're looking we're searching in here maybe did i did you guys see where the last guy was

977
01:09:53,540 --> 01:10:03,260
too dark i know it's very dark right it's hard for even me to Let the lead that lives in your heart tell you if they're people or not.

978
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,460
What is that supposed to mean?

979
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,790
I don't know if I can go downstairs.

980
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,010
I think it's too flooded, no?

981
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:18,010
Yeah, too flooded.

982
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:20,330
Good thought, though.

983
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:20,810
Good idea.

984
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,490
Winter Espa fam.

985
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,050
Welcome back.

986
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,830
Thank you so much.

987
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:26,150
Thank you.

988
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:26,690
Thank you.

989
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:28,830
Am I crazy?

990
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,430
It's payball!

991
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,400
Does any of you have a cute little accessory?

992
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,280
Am I missing a classroom?

993
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,100
Oh, there was a...

994
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,640
Here.

995
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:49,080
But it's so dark.

996
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,120
I can't see anything.

997
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,260
Open the door, please!

998
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,340
Thank you.

999
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,260
Yeah, the GPS is gone.

1000
01:10:59,220 --> 01:10:59,620
Hmm.

1001
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,100
Hmm.

1002
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,360
I don't think it's the purple part, right?

1003
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,240
be the purple thing, no?

1004
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,040
Oops, I didn't mean to jump.

1005
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,980
Like, what's the color of the last accessory?

1006
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:26,820
Unless.

1007
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,920
No, I don't think so.

1008
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,360
I don't know!

1009
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:34,780
Where is she?

1010
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,320
Nice job.

1011
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,460
Do the same for others.

1012
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,350
Where, though?

1013
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:43,930
Where?

1014
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:58,810
why is she purple it's because it's spooky season what do you mean why i just wanted to be dressed up is that such a problem am

1015
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:12,720
i a fish person am i supposed to be down here okay no oops i missed

1016
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,900
we debunk that real quick

1017
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,180
I wanted to be spooky.

1018
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,900
What's so wrong with wanting to be spooky, huh?

1019
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:32,360
Whoa!

1020
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,800
That was a lot of money.

1021
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,340
We're at 9,000 yen, everybody.

1022
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,780
Rags to riches story over here.

1023
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,400
I have no idea.

1024
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,840
I'm about to give up, honestly.

1025
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,080
Because I don't want to...

1026
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,360
But I want to see the demo through to the end.

1027
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,080
You know what I mean?

1028
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,840
But if I can't find it, I don't know what to do.

1029
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,200
If I can't find the last fish, what am I supposed to do, you know?

1030
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,090
Check a guide?

1031
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,790
I doubt there's guides, because this is just a demo.

1032
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:21,890
Who's cuter?

1033
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:22,790
Lilac or Minto?

1034
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,470
Don't answer that.

1035
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:46,770
Alright, we might just call it here then, and go on to the next game.

1036
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,170
I don't want to just keep running around in circles.

1037
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:59,740
I feel like incomplete, but at the same time, it is just a demo, so...

1038
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,020
What's Min's favorite type of music?

1039
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,980
Any kind with a fresh beat.

1040
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,440
What'd that mean?

1041
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:12,760
Did I see something just swim away down there right now?

1042
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:20,260
But yeah, maybe I want to play this once it's actually out.

1043
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,000
It seems kind of spooky and fun, so...

1044
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,960
We shall play!

1045
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:32,720
the chillas art game uh once it's out yeah

1046
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,860
the purple zone is where they are how do you know though how do you know

1047
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:55,980

1048
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,200
let's get up

1049
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,160
we found our boys Oh, and I'm stuck.

1050
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:21,500
There we go.

1051
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,420
I got somebody.

1052
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,220
My bad.

1053
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,460
Collateral damage.

1054
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,430
Oh my gosh, she's so freaking fast!

1055
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:47,880
Oh, makes sense.

1056
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,480
This is the room that I couldn't get into.

1057
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,000
I got her!

1058
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:54,490
Yay!

1059
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,450
We can actually complete it maybe.

1060
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,520
The lighting goes like crazy in this game, honestly.

1061
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,560
Oh, I got her.

1062
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,700
Where'd she go?

1063
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,800
There she is.

1064
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:14,220
You.

1065
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,180
Okay.

1066
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,160
All right, come on.

1067
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,260
Up to the roof we go.

1068
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:25,400
It feels like it's getting dark and not at the same time.

1069
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,240
Is it just me?

1070
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,100
All right.

1071
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,680
Let's see what happens with our guy up here.

1072
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,960
Something's not right.

1073
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,800
Aren't these the ones who were getting bullied?

1074
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,720
Wait, which is which?

1075
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,500
Oh, right, my apologies.

1076
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,820
I have the memory of a goldfish, you see.

1077
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:56,980
Either way, the weak must be consumed by the strong, yes?

1078
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,280
Just like how I consumed my tank mates.

1079
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,680
Now if you'll excuse me.

1080
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,260
Oh my gosh, it's far.

1081
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,790
Enjoy.

1082
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,250
Get to the mall.

1083
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,850
How long is this demo?

1084
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:44,270
For real, though.

1085
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,110
How long is this?

1086
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,440
Okay.

1087
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,340
Let's get some upgrades.

1088
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,180
Sell this female fish.

1089
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,340
For one!

1090
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,200
Kenny?

1091
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,120
Shut up.

1092
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:13,760
It's okay.

1093
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:17,100
I was going to say I think we could do both, but we really cannot.

1094
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,060
I think I need to buy...

1095
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,000
I think I need to max out my thing, though.

1096
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:23,540
Oh my gosh.

1097
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,740
Am I just going to be playing a demo the entire game?

1098
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,420
Entire stream is just demo.

1099
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:30,380
Can you imagine?

1100
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,280
That'd be so silly.

1101
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,780
Is that fish over there?

1102
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,740
No, I don't think so.

1103
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:38,940
Woo, fishing!

1104
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,560
It was what?

1105
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,180
7,000?

1106
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,100
There's got to be some fish around here, no?

1107
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,480
I'm going to pass out.

1108
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,580
I'm ready to pass.

1109
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,360
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish.

1110
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:56,930
Timid fish, I think.

1111
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:58,670
Those sold for pretty good.

1112
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:00,790
Wait, where'd they go?

1113
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:01,730
Oh, there.

1114
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:05,910
Kind of far, though.

1115
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:07,810
Yay!

1116
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:11,390
Is this a horror game?

1117
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:12,010
I don't know.

1118
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:27,630
fish in seifuku what are you saying you tell me i think for some people this is probably like super unnerving you were planning on playing demos the entire stream no wow demos plural

1119
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:55,890
it's okay we'll we'll get through some don't worry even if it's like a longer stream whatever wait how much was it again seven thousand wait oh i have six thousand okay we need just uh one more fish one more and a little bit extra for some what's it called some fuel and we'll be good to go!

1120
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:57,110
Dang it!

1121
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:01,840
No!

1122
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:02,860
How did you know?

1123
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,800
How did you know?

1124
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,160
Got him.

1125
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,740
This is what they mean, yeah, when they say there's many fish in the sea.

1126
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,260
The horror comes in a DLC.

1127
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:28,660
see I crack myself up we

1128
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:59,680
can get more we can get more oh just kidding I pass out somewhere beyond the sea somewhere waiting for me little fish in sailor food I'll catch them my way and we'll go boating.

1129
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:01,060
Wait!

1130
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,640
I don't think my range is good enough for that guy.

1131
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,920
No, no, no, don't notice me!

1132
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:10,380
You!

1133
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:11,460
Yeah.

1134
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:15,720
It's really satisfying hearing the...

1135
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,180
Okay!

1136
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:25,800
DMCA.

1137
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,980
Alright, this should be enough money for gas and upgrades.

1138
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:35,600
Oh, my bad.

1139
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,120
Uh, yes.

1140
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,780
Uh, sell.

1141
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,000
Select all.

1142
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,840
And gas, please.

1143
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,520
Okay.

1144
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,520
Alrighty, which way we head into?

1145
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,000
It looks far, though.

1146
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:53,800
I'm scared.

1147
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:54,420
My bad.

1148
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,180
It looks pretty far.

1149
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,740
What I'm going to do is I'm going to face the direction.

1150
01:21:59,840 --> 01:21:59,860
Yep.

1151
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:00,940
And we're just going to...

1152
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:02,100
I'm not even going to look at the map.

1153
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,040
We're just going to go.

1154
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,760
We're going to go, go, go.

1155
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,080
Because when I look at the map...

1156
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:10,080
The gas is still going down, but...

1157
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,680
But the speed is also going down.

1158
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,060
Oh wait, I think I see it already.

1159
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,320
The moon!

1160
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:24,670
Oh, the sun is so nice.

1161
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:29,210
something never nobody has ever said before on stream

1162
01:22:33,830 --> 01:23:06,530

1164
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:36,920
Phantom Mall.

1165
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,620
Wait, I think that's it.

1166
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:42,510
What?

1167
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:42,890
What?

1168
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,030
What?

1169
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,090
What's that?

1170
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:45,930
Wait, what's it?

1171
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,770
Oh!

1172
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,650
Did you guys see that?

1173
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,130
I only caught the tail!

1174
01:23:59,210 --> 01:23:59,870
But it's gone.

1175
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:02,290
It's not on our radar anymore.

1176
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:07,850
Is this supposed to be an Aeon Mall?

1177
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:09,490
It kind of looks like a similar logo.

1178
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:11,590
It might fall.

1179
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:13,170
False positive.

1180
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,690
Exactly, exactly.

1181
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:16,230
Wait, is that a Daiso?

1182
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:21,190
Aeon malls are very...

1183
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:22,870
Oh my gosh, wait, there's...

1184
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,410
Is this supposed to be like, Odaibo?

1185
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:26,610
Or...

1186
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:28,090
Oh no, this is so funny.

1187
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,050
Wait, wait, wait.

1188
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,230
Oh, okay, that's the gas thing.

1189
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:34,570
Okay.

1190
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:37,610
Oh my gosh, are we just gonna...

1191
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:38,830
Oh, did you guys see that?

1192
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:44,490
Oh, it's a face!

1193
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:45,570
Ah!

1194
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,700
It was a big old head.

1195
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,180
We got consumed.

1196
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,680
I wanted to make it to the mall.

1197
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,520
It looked cute.

1198
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,240
Yay!

1199
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:16,860
We did the demo.

1200
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:18,760
Awesome.

1201
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,960
Yeah, so that was Umigari, the new Chillas art game coming out.

1202
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:59,740

1205
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:30,940
Oh.

1206
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,960
The window for it is so tiny.

1207
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:35,220
Is it going to get big?

1208
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,360
Okay.

1209
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,060
Ah, eh, ah, eh, ah, eh.

1210
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,020
Ah, oh.

1211
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,400
Oh.

1212
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:43,200
Wait, this is so strange.

1213
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,160
Okay, hold on.

1214
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,040
Let me capture it for you guys so you can see it.

1215
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:50,180
It's really small for me, but hopefully it's a deep...

1216
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:51,880
Oh, it's really small for you guys as well.

1217
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,440
It's...

1218
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:00,580
Okay!

1219
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,120

Oh, oh, start stream right here, okay?

1222
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,500
This is just like OBS!

1223
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,440
Wow!

1224
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,040
Oh, wow, it's just OBS.

1225
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,960
Live rec version.

1226
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:24,880
Okay.

1227
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,740
Well, the screen is so small for me.

1228
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,920

We just have desktop audio on, our avatar, our game capture ready to go.

1233
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:08,920
Chat settings.

1234
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:11,760
Why is it called game stream setting?

1235
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,140
Why is it not called like loading screen?

1236
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,100
Starting soon.

1237
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,420

Tachibana, Liruri.

01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,540
Prism Live, fourth generation.

1241
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,940
Acrylic stand!

1242
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,040
On sale now!

1243
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,740
Wait, it kind of... Wait, this kind of looks like my second outfit, no?

1244
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:40,900
Neruri!

1245
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,000
Wait, I'm blocking her.

1246
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,460
Hold on.

1247
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:45,400
Wait.

1248
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:51,790
Soaking in my Oshi's voice.

1249
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,030
Welcome back, Neruri!

1250
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,870
Koen Neruri!

1251
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,550
Totally worth waiting and stand by.

1252
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,250
What kind of stream is it today?

1253
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:01,710
The BGM feels a bit nostalgic.

1254
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:03,310
Too cute from the start!

1255
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:03,710
Wow!

1256
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,270
Akasupa!

1257
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:05,510
Oh,

1258
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:10,790
it's a collab.

1259
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,590
Liruli, Tachibana now's a dreamy!

1260
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:15,330
Come, Lirly.

1261
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:16,570
Come, Lirly.

1262
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,030
Wow, she's getting so many Akasuba.

1263
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:22,990
She's so popular.

1264
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,890
Sparkling, Lirilo, sweet days.

1265
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,170
Wait, she's so cute, though.

1266
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,170
Wait, can I change?

1267
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:33,970
I kind of want to match her.

1268
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:35,630
One second.

1269
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,040
Sorry, I won't be lilac anymore.

1270
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,300
It's so similar, actually.

1271
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,600
This is kind of funny.

1272
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:57,750
Except her ahog it goes down and mine goes up.

1273
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:59,990
We look like sisters or something.

1274
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,110
Wait a second.

1275
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,270
We look like sisters or something.

1276
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:09,490
This is kind of freaky.

1277
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:16,090
Okay, let's keep playing.

1278
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:18,490
Oh, premium chat, thank you.

1279
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:19,690
Oh, premium chat!

1280
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:21,890
Her voice is so cute.

1281
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:31,290
Today, I was totally pushed by my gen mate, Suzuka Yozora, to play a horror game.

1282
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:35,950
Actually, I didn't look into see if Liruri Tachibana is a real YouTuber or not.

1283
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,650
But...

1284
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:41,270
Congrats, man, for your new journey as a YouTuber.

1285
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:48,170
Kind of looks like she's better at pushing her merch.

1286
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:22,350
I'm going to play cursed ruins, re-home.

1287
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,130
Just hearing your voice give me energy.

1288
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:26,910
Do you guys feel that way about me too?

1289
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:29,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1290
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:33,350
I mean...

1291
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,810
You guys still think I'm cuter than...

1292
01:31:35,810 --> 01:31:36,710
Liruri, right?

1293
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:39,810
Yes?

1294
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:42,230
Yes!

1295
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:46,470
My Oshi saves the world again, Kon Liruri.

1296
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:50,450
I think I told which one is the evil sister.

1297
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:51,090
No!

1298
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:51,790
No!

1299
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:52,330
No!

1300
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,200
What do you mean you're not sure?

1301
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:58,500
Oh,

1302
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:04,520
is Klaus?

1303
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,590
Do I just need to up my appeal for you guys?

1304
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:15,810
Hell yeah!

1305
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:22,110
I need to up my appeal!

1306
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:24,370
She has whiskers!

1307
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:25,530
I have pointy ears!

1308
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:26,830
I have four ears!

1309
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,650
Why would you say that on a collab?

1310
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,470
You're right, I'm like bullying.

1311
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:36,150
Shit,

1312
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:41,610
the movement looks so good though, right?

1313
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:44,990
Like, apparently this game has some rumors.

1314
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:52,590
The flylack had caught ears.

1315
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:57,630
They said a lot happened during development and it was almost cancelled.

1316
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:01,190
Die it literally on the line!

1317
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,120
We have Tachibana Lirudy at home.

1318
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,760
And it's me!

1319
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,400
It's not even true, I can't help but wonder.

1320
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,620
By the way, do you guys know this game?

1321
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:32,900
Let me know in the comments if you've played it or if it's your first time.

1322
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,620
Oh, we're playing?

1323
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,880
Oh, I'm reading- I read comments this way.

1324
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,840
Wait, we're looking at each other.

1325
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,900
Virudy doesn't have shoulder straps.

1326
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:54,990
I can also- I can also up my appeal.

1327
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,950
Oh, senior fungus.

1328
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:59,550
Yes, we do in fact think the same way about me.

1329
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:00,970
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1330
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:03,250
And I thank you for Akasupas.

1331
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:05,290
She's totally ignoring them.

1332
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:07,490
Thank you so, so much.

1333
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:08,090
Thank you.

1334
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,690
I see, I see, I see.

1335
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:15,170
I see, I see.

1336
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:19,150
Looks like a lot of you are new to it.

1337
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,910
Yooooosh.

1338
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,590
So kind of this VTuber live translate for my OG Nihiruri.

1339
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:28,010
Niruri?

1340
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:30,310
You've already given her a nickname!

1341
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,560
You've already called her Niruri?

1342
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,240
Niruri who?

1343
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:42,860
Yeah!

1344
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:43,460
Yeah!

1345
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:47,460
Tachibana Ludi was a job actress?

1346
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:51,280
Hot dog.

1347
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,220
Yeah.

1348
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,620
Hearing your voice gives you energy.

1349
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,400
Hot dog, thank you.

1350
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,460
And D-Rudinki?

1351
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:03,000
D-Rudinki?

1352
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,540
D-Rudin will take the lead.

1353
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:05,280
What about- Oh.

1354
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,800
It's not like I'm scared or anything.

1355
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,740
I might get a little startled though.

1356
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,380
I might get a little startled though.

1357
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:22,360
By the way, I plan not to get scared.

1358
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:29,200
Oh my gosh, they always donate $2,000.

1359
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,540
I love green, Liruri.

1360
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,780
Thank you.

1361
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,900
Thank you for so much.

1362
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:40,100
Thank you, thank you.

1363
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:41,840
I might scream.

1364
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:42,620
Maybe.

1365
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:43,860
Probably.

1366
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,320
Oh,

1367
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:54,020
so be careful with your volume, especially if you're wearing earphones.

1368
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:59,820
Alright then, let's get started right away!

1369
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:03,660
Cursed Ruins!

1370
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:04,320
Rehome!

1371
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,060
Cursed Ruins!

1372
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:06,060
Rehome!

1373
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:12,540
She may be cute, but Minto is another level?

1374
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,200
Oh, the Saikyu or Teruhashi rival shows up.

1375
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,120
I heard Dirudin has more voice.

1376
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,520
Why suddenly Dirudin?

1377
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,960
She looks like she plays through OBS.

1378
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,920
This is a horror game where you try to escape from a ruin sealed by a curse.

1379
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,340
Oh, Dirudin, I think you need to adjust the volume.

1380
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,520
The game is too loud.

1381
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,600
It's too loud.

1382
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,940
All over the ruin, there are doors that are cursed.

1383
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:56,140
And it seems you have to use Ofuda charms to lift the curses and proceed.

1384
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:01,370
Leave my Yoshi alone.

1385
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:03,470
Doesn't that sound a bit too real?

1386
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:03,810
Lucky,

1387
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:08,310
lucky.

1388
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:09,450
Lirudine.

1389
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:10,990
Curse of Lirudine.

1390
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:13,850
Can you pass this money along to the lady on your right?

1391
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:17,210
Look, you could very easily donate to her.

1392
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,370
Just hearing that kind of thing already makes my heart race.

1393
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:24,890
But I'll do my best to escape.

1394
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:28,930
So please everyone, cheer me on, okay?

1395
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:31,290
Oh, I'm playing the game!

1396
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:32,950
Wait, I'm actually the streamer!

1397
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:34,090
Ooh, what is that?

1398
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,290
Wait, this is kind of scary.

1399
01:37:36,970 --> 01:37:38,810
It's so quiet, it's actually scary.

1400
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:41,250
That's what I just said.

1401
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,730
I'm turning it down.

1402
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:44,370
What the heck?

1403
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:45,710
Weird.

1404
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:47,230
Maybe it's just my imagination.

1405
01:37:48,930 --> 01:38:17,790
what's their imagination what is this thing they're really controlled oh if you use this it creates an area where enemies can't get close there's enemies in this game what is this starting to feel a bit dizzy wait what is this oh pick up looks like you can see the map while you're holding this ah okay so Q create.

1406
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:19,290
Is this even the right way?

1407
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:20,330
Wait, who's talking?

1408
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:21,950
Me or the streamer?

1409
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:26,970
The vibe here is bad.

1410
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:29,890
I'm scared.

1411
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:33,590
I didn't expect to play this kind of game.

1412
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:38,970
What is this?

1413
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:40,210
Let's check this place out.

1414
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:43,710
Oh, if the enemy spots us, we should run and hide here.

1415
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:44,970
Oh, we can run.

1416
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:45,410
Oh my gosh.

1417
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:46,010
There's stamina.

1418
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,470
Wait, this is It's so crazy!

1419
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:54,870
Mito, cute Oshi, no other thoughts in this brain.

1420
01:38:55,170 --> 01:38:56,090
Thank you!

1421
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,510
Is that not an enemy?

1422
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:02,070
Didn't I just pass here?

1423
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:05,250
Yeah, but like I have to go the other way.

1424
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,000
Why?

1425
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,140
I'm scared but I have to know!

1426
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,240
No you don't, girl!

1427
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,520
It was- it was moving at me!

1428
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,440
Did you hear that?

1429
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:34,130
What if it kills me?

1430
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,030
Let's just go for it.

1431
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:45,950
Okay.

1432
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:48,670
It's not in here anymore?

1433
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,630
What is this so lit up though for?

1434
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:52,390
Nothing.

1435
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,790
Calm down, Nirudi.

1436
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:58,410
Stay cool.

1437
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:59,130
Yeah, Nirudi.

1438
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:01,110
You're freaking out.

1439
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:06,050
I'm getting nervous.

1440
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,830
Me too!

1441
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:10,310
Why am I suddenly in this spooky game?

1442
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:10,730
Oh.

1443
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,830
Oh!

1444
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,350
There's the, there was the, there was the enemy.

1445
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,130
Why is it colder in this room?

1446
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,550
I saw it.

1447
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:31,070
I accidentally used my salt.

1448
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,210
Wait, will this kill me?

1449
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:33,730
Let's see.

1450
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:37,130
Oh.

1451
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:40,410
Oh, look at her face.

1452
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,510
It's behind me.

1453
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:45,810
Wait, where do I hide?

1454
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:47,170
Wait, oh, it's going away.

1455
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:47,670
Uh-oh, wait.

1456
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:48,650
Is the barrier fading?

1457
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:50,030
Uh-oh.

1458
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:51,690
Don't come closer!

1459
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:52,690
Woo!

1460
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:53,930
Woo!

1461
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:02,230
Okay, we're fine.

1462
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:02,850
We're fine.

1463
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,320
Surely it'll disappear, right?

1464
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:17,110
Uh-oh.

1465
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,220
Oh, it's leaving, it's leaving.

1466
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:28,050
If I die, though, I wonder what happens.

1467
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:31,210
Let's see.

1468
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:33,290
I'm curious what happens.

1469
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:37,430
Yeah, GG, Otsuriruri!

1470
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:42,490
Oh, okay.

1471
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:44,270
So we have to do the game.

1472
01:41:45,490 --> 01:41:46,710
Okay, pick up.

1473
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:49,290
Pick up.

1474
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:50,550
Wait, pick up.

1475
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:51,470
Pick up.

1476
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:54,490
Oh, freaky!

1477
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:02,430
We'll just get a head start from it then.

1478
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:06,590
And then we know this lady runs at me!

1479
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:09,690
There's

1480
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:14,150
another one in here!

1481
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,640
Let's keep going.

1482
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:20,900
Yeah.

1483
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,700
I don't like this room.

1484
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:26,960
Why?

1485
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,100
It's a healing room, no?

1486
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,600
Okay, there's so many rooms, though.

1487
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:33,780
That, like, have the...

1488
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,080
Check.

1489
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,740
What am I checking for?

1490
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:36,660
The clothes.

1491
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:38,280
Okay, just...

1492
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:38,420
Okay.

1493
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:41,180
Check, check, check.

1494
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:41,740
What am I checking?

1495
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:42,080
Ah!

1496
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:44,480
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1497
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,640
Yeah, more solid.

1498
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,320
Okay, good.

1499
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:49,720
Uh-uh.

1500
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:51,400
We're gaming.

1501
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,060
I wonder how long this game is though.

1502
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,220
What was the... Oh, we need to find the Ofuda, right?

1503
01:42:57,420 --> 01:42:59,260
And then...

1504
01:42:59,260 --> 01:42:59,560
What?

1505
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,240
Huh?

1506
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:02,760
What?

1507
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,220
What is it?

1508
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,560
I didn't expect to...

1509
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:13,520
Footsteps are mine.

1510
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:14,180
There are footsteps?

1511
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:15,680
Where?

1512
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:21,480
I didn't expect to play an actual scary game.

1513
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,100
This camera view makes me dizzy.

1514
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,480
It's funny, though, because I'm, like, playing it, but...

1515
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:30,100
Oh, is this the exit?

1516
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:31,540
Ah!

1517
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,480
Oh, I thought that was somebody standing there.

1518
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,000
Okay, so we found the exit.

1519
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,400
Bad news bears.

1520
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:45,420
Kauai-ya!

1521
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,560
10 to 20 minutes?

1522
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,880
What, this...

1523
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:54,800
of the game or the whole demo?

1524
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,320
It's so funny.

1525
01:43:58,660 --> 01:44:00,280
Like, I feel...

1526
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:05,480
Like, I'm playing the game, obviously, but it's, like, in this tiny window.

1527
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,940
So it's a little less bad?

1528
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:10,740
I think I need to go...

1529
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,380
Over here.

1530
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,780
I miss the fish.

1531
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:16,960
I miss fishing.

1532
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,840
I wish I was fishing, for real.

1533
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:33,420
wishing i was fishing well we found the exit meantosis yeah this looks like a oh no no no

1534
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:42,650
so let's let us open the sealed door oh okay we just need the one

1535
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:52,620
suddenly going wild.

1536
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,960
Those chatters are so funny.

1537
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:56,120
Oh, this is a dead end.

1538
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:57,460
Win, win, win, win, win.

1539
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:10,340
It's the...

1540
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:12,360
The entire demo is 10 to 20.

1541
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:16,260
Cool, cool.

1542
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,140
Thank you for checking.

1543
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:18,820
I really appreciate it.

1544
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,840
She's getting so many Akasupas.

1545
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,220
Dirudy is top VTuber of the world.

1546
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,060
I'm sorry, Dirudy.

1547
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,320
I did not know your game.

1548
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:32,740
She just wants to save right now.

1549
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,800
It's not scary, chat.

1550
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:37,580
Wait, I have the...

1551
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:38,600
Oh, I have it.

1552
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,280
Open!

1553
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:41,740
Okay.

1554
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:43,000
Nice.

1555
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,980
Is this the end of the game?

1556
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:47,680
What is this?

1557
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:51,080
While you're holding this item, it can block one attack.

1558
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:52,940
Oh my gosh.

1559
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:56,440
Am I gonna get a...

1560
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:08,860
passed away.

1561
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,400
She's so calm.

1562
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:10,980
She's so cool.

1563
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,820
I can't even speak anymore.

1564
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,780
She's so chill.

1565
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:14,760
She's so collected.

1566
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,500
Couldn't that be...

1567
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:33,270
Dang it.

1568
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,580
Wait, I'm kind of a genius.

1569
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:44,880
I got her in the middle of the door.

1570
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,520
I'm kind of a genius.

1571
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,420
I got her in the door so I could run.

1572
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,840
Wait, she just comes running at me like that?

1573
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,680
messed up.

1574
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:57,580
How am I supposed to block that?

1575
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,680
How am I supposed to...

1576
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:06,900
She just comes and read it at me.

1577
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:11,670
Second chat is so scared, a bunch of babies.

1578
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:14,110
Her surprise face is too cute.

1579
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:16,230
She says, wait, wait, wait.

1580
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,730
Quiet horror is the worst.

1581
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:20,330
Crops to the effect team.

1582
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:23,070
It was so real, I got goosebumps.

1583
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:31,270
They're so funny.

1584
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:35,210
I'm scared, though.

1585
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:38,070
I don't want her running at me.

1586
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:40,010
I'm actually scared of her running at me.

1587
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:42,730
I don't like getting run at, like, you know.

1588
01:47:45,050 --> 01:47:45,330
Okay.

1589
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:50,850
I wonder what this is used for.

1590
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,290
I could chop her up.

1591
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:55,890
Ah!

1592
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:56,410
Ah!

1593
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:58,700
Oh!

1594
01:47:59,140 --> 01:47:59,460
Uh-oh.

1595
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:01,260
Uh-oh.

1596
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:03,840
Please don't come down this way.

1597
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,120
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

1598
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,300
Wait, this is messed up.

1599
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,590
Can I use the...

1600
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,230
I

1601
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:25,490
don't think I can clear this game.

1602
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:29,410
Literally gave up.

1603
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,240
Quick game.

1604
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:39,480
Yeah, let's call it a day for now.

1605
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:40,680
Well then.

1606
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,520
Isn't the screen acting a little weird?

1607
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,180
This isn't part of the game, right?

1608
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:07,320
Can you guys still see it properly?

1609
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,620
Did it crash?

1610
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,500
The stream is down?

1611
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,200
Oh no!

1612
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:17,940
Wait.

1613
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,920
This isn't her webcam, right?

1614
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:23,140
This isn't her webcam, right?

1615
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:26,320
Looks like it's down maybe.

1616
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,800
Let's just restart once.

1617
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,760
She's still really cute though.

1618
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:36,880
It won't start.

1619
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:42,420
This is seriously bad.

1620
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:48,000
What should I do?

1621
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,300
The stream stops halfway.

1622
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,740
My immersion!

1623
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,620
Are you telling me that cute woman was a cute woman all along?

1624
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,080
Ending without saying anything is probably bad.

1625
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:05,860
No, you don't understand.

1626
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,700
It was a... it was a... it was a... it was a... it's not your fault.

1627
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:12,560
I need to report it on social media.

1628
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,040
Where did I leave my phone?

1629
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,440
Wow!

1630
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,740
She's got birch!

1631
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:20,020
Oh, wow.

1632
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:27,440
Oh, she's doxxed.

1633
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:32,760
Looking at it, looking at it like this is a little embarrassing, but it's proof of how hard I worked.

1634
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,760
Prism Live, fourth generation.

1635
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,800
Oh, cute!

1636
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:47,760
That's an important word to know for your oshi, or for, yeah, for your oshi is totoy.

1637
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,060
It's pret means precious.

1638
01:50:52,860 --> 01:50:53,620
So dreamy.

1639
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:56,780
Wait, did she get a figure too?

1640
01:50:57,380 --> 01:51:04,340
Oh, you're so cute.

1641
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:07,460
This pose and this is so cute.

1642
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,160
This pose and expression are just perfect.

1643
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,040
Mountain cut design.

1644
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,640
Okay, so we got to find our phone.

1645
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,720
Wait, did you read a magazine too?

1646
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:20,180
No wonder she was getting Wazoo.

1647
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,260
She's so popular.

1648
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:23,960
Wow.

1649
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:24,900
Need to be.

1650
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,540
We're not going to get attacked by like a running lady, are we?

1651
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,000
Did we leave our phone in the bathroom?

1652
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:36,540
In the toilet?

1653
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:37,420
No?

1654
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:39,260
Wow, this is a nice apartment too.

1655
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:40,920
And, oh, there it is.

1656
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,800
Let's let the viewers know.

1657
01:51:50,900 --> 01:52:22,200

1660
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:26,400
What did I do?

1661
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:29,580
Reveals famous JP Dirudy.

1662
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:30,220
No!

1663
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:35,980

1665
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:37,980
Okay.

1666
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:48,410
You guys are going to cancel me.

1667
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:51,250
Oh, she scared me in the mirror.

1668
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:53,210
Whoa.

1669
01:52:55,590 --> 01:52:56,830
This place is nice.

1670
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:59,970
Who's this guy?

1671
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:02,910
He's my absolute favorite.

1672
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:09,530
Turn off the room lights.

1673
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:11,470
Wait, I want to explore the rest.

1674
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:12,570
You act like this.

1675
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:13,030
Wait.

1676
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:14,910
You act like you wouldn't do this too.

1677
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:15,630
Hey, shut up.

1678
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:16,250
Hey.

1679
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:18,310
We're not talking about me here.

1680
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:20,670
Okay.

1681
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:24,690
Real lights.

1682
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:27,130
Oh, here.

1683
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:30,970
What was that sound?

1684
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:32,870
Was that my...

1685
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,970
Wait, we're just gonna leave the computer like this?

1686
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:37,510
But it's...

1687
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:38,330
Okay.

1688
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:41,350
I like how the figure is glowing.

1689
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,240
Good night.

01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:48,480
No shower.

1691
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,860
No change of clothes.

1692
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,140
Just like a real VTuber.

1693
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,280
October 8th end.

1694
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:17,940

01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:40,290
So that was fun.

1714
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:42,990
Okay.

1715
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:44,610
Let's do the next one I have.

1716
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:45,390
The next one.

1717
01:56:46,750 --> 01:57:44,230
This one I chose because it just kind of looked interesting i guess i don't know um yeah i'll read the description actually it said like popular user defined tags for this product and it said exploration and i was like i like that i like that i like that so this one is called mumble pines the arrival and it says in this first person story driven horror game you take a job as a janitor to access a rundown island summer camp that got shut down after the disappearance of your brother which was one only one of many incidents it's up to you to uncover the island's buried secrets i chose this one because it looked good it kind of reminded me of like the fire watch game handshake yeah mum mumble mumble pines mumbo no mumbo mumbo am i saying it bad

1718
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:50,170

01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:52,670
No, no Mambo.

1720
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:58,530
So I chose this one because, yeah, like I said, it just looked good.

1721
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:01,290
And I was just kind of interested in him.

1722
01:58:01,410 --> 01:58:02,990
Okay, let's try it.

1723
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:03,430

Mambo number five.

1725
01:58:10,350 --> 01:58:11,030
Tag you on TikTok.

1726
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:13,610
Oh, I don't have a TikTok, but thank you.

1727
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:15,950
Um, hold on.

1728
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:18,450
Why?

1729
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:20,190
Is this like...

1730
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:23,010
I think I'm lagging.

1731
01:58:23,290 --> 01:58:25,630
The game is humongous.

1732
01:58:25,810 --> 01:58:26,830
Give me one second.

1733
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:33,790
Uh...

1734
01:58:33,790 --> 01:58:34,830
Then who did he tag?

1735
01:58:34,990 --> 01:58:35,670
I don't know.

1736
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:37,970
Is there a mint imposter on TikTok?

1737
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:39,770
Because it's not me.

1738
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:41,170
I don't have a TikTok.

1739
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:43,130
Like I have a personal TikTok.

1740
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:44,030
But...

1741
01:58:44,030 --> 01:58:45,330
Jack, welcome back!

1742
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:54,240
Hold on.

1743
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:58,620
The game has been loading and I'm waiting for like a title screen.

1744
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:01,480
Oh, but nothing is...

1745
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:02,200
Oh, oh.

1746
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,580
Compiling shader.

1747
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,020
Oh my god.

1748
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:08,740
You guys, look at this.

1749
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:14,090
The shaders.

1750
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:14,710
It's compiled.

1751
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:18,250
I've never seen this before.

1752
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:22,010
Oh my gosh.

1753
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:26,850
I'll try.

1754
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:31,510
Okay, maybe once this happens, I'll stop lagging a little.

1755
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:35,010
Minky is the spookiest and what else?

1756
01:59:35,570 --> 01:59:36,250
Freakiest?

1757
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:38,890
Thank you!

1758
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:41,910
Bye-bye frame rate.

1759
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:43,910
Frames per sometimes.

1760
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:45,090
Oh.

1761
01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:48,210
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1762
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:50,910
Oh, let's see.

1763
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:52,510
Okay, settings.

1764
01:59:53,590 --> 01:59:54,070
Settings, please.

1765
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:57,050
We'll do everything we need to.

1766
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:02,490
Oh wait, let me FPS, there we go.

1767
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:03,710
It's another slider.

1768
02:00:03,970 --> 02:00:04,650
Is this...

1769
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:07,190
Keep zero for unlimited.

1770
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:07,910
No, no, no.

1771
02:00:08,090 --> 02:00:08,990
No camera shake.

1772
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,300
I'm so smooth.

1773
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:17,500
Okay.

1774
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:19,860
That should be better.

1775
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:22,220
Much better.

1776
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:26,000
Okay, we're still smooth.

1777
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:26,700
We're still smooth.

1778
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:28,420
Start a new game.

1779
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:32,520
It's been 2.5 years since he went missing.

1780
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,460
The police investigated the camp, but didn't, wait, what?

1781
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:37,500
But all I know is they're lying about this place.

1782
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:39,740
So I will find out what happened by myself.

1783
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,120
Breaking the answers to those left in the dark.

1784
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,200
And find my brother!

1785
02:00:52,910 --> 02:00:55,150
It was so fast, the tag!

1786
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:57,900
Hello?

1787
02:00:59,140 --> 02:00:59,620
Ah!

1788
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:00,240
Sorry.

1789
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:05,480
Oh.

1790
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:09,860
Whoa, it looks nice.

1791
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,460
Game save.

1792
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:19,220
Do you see, like, the camera, like, gets wobbly when I turn my head?

1793
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:20,980
I hope this doesn't get me motion sick.

1794
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:25,420
We're fishing again!

1795
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,940
I can't stop fishing!

1796
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:32,860
There goes last ship for the whole month to leave this god-forsaken island.

1797
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:33,920
There's voice acting.

1798
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:35,920
Aw, man.

1799
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:38,820
What's this?

1800
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,740
Nothing, just a shovel.

1801
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:46,080
You guys see that, like, head wobble whenever I move them, like, move around, though?

1802
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,880
Hey, you must be the new janitor they hired.

1803
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:54,500
I can't greet you in person right now, but I left a videotape in the main lodge.

1804
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,400
On there, you find all the information you need to work here.

1805
02:01:57,680 --> 02:01:57,880
Okay.

1806
02:01:57,880 --> 02:02:00,540
If I need your help at some point, I will call you over the speaker system.

1807
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,740
But for now, make yourself at home.

1808
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,720
What is the side?

1809
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:09,040
Why do they...

1810
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:12,080
What kind of entrance is this?

1811
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:18,280
Chat and Minky, I have something to admit in front of everyone.

1812
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:20,980
Even if I'm not in membership, I love Minky.

1813
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:22,560
Ah, thank you!

1814
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:23,920
Wait, they're AI voices?

1815
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,520
How can you tell?

1816
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,780
Wait, how can you tell?

1817
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:36,960
Uh-oh, there's stamina on running, which means there's going to be a reason that we need to run.

1818
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:40,920
Because it's so flat.

1819
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:44,700
Ma.

1820
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:46,380
Damn.

1821
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,480
Just arrived and almost got killed already.

1822
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:50,700
Okay.

1823
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,080
I think you guys are right.

1824
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:54,700
Damn.

1825
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,860
Just arrived and almost got killed already.

1826
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,400
Why is it so like...

1827
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:08,700
What does that say?

1828
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:37,640

1829
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:38,200
by the way.

1830
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,540
Well, it's just a demo.

1831
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:43,980
Snake, thank you so much for the time get there.

1832
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:50,670
Yeah, maybe they're placeholders, you know.

1833
02:03:51,470 --> 02:03:55,070
Maybe they plan on getting real people for the actual game.

1834
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,840
So, we will hope for that.

1835
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,820
We will fingers crossed for that.

1836
02:04:08,230 --> 02:04:08,690
Can I go?

1837
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:10,570
Oh, I guess I just have to go inside here.

1838
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:14,550
What's in here?

1839
02:04:15,310 --> 02:04:17,330
TV, a whole room just for the TV?

1840
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:26,230
I think this place janitor jobs coming soon.

1841
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:33,910
Why does this place need a janitor when it's not even functional?

1842
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:38,450
Does the guy on the loudspeaker even exist?

1843
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:42,330
Oh, here's our TV.

1844
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:49,680

1846
02:05:14,830 --> 02:05:18,910
Before we can get to the fun part, we have to talk about some rules on this island.

1847
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:24,110
In case of an emergency, please notify the staff immediately.

1848
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:26,350
Am I not?

1849
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:29,390
For your own safety, swimming in the ocean is not allowed.

1850
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:33,650
Our lake, however, is open to use for everyone.

1851
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,430
Oh, nice!

1852
02:05:35,430 --> 02:06:02,970
On the entire island, it is strictly forbidden to make open fires outside of designated fire locations in the rare case of a forest fire please make your way to the evacuation point and wait for further instructions but for now make yourself at home in your assigned sleeping lodge and feel free to explore our beautiful island oh and one more thing yeah after 9 p.m.

1853
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:10,490
it is strictly forbidden to go outside of the sleeping area due to previous inconveniences with visitors.

1854
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:14,030
It was the static?

1855
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:14,470
Okay.

1856
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:16,890
I guess we got some jobs now then.

1857
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:19,890
Let's just push it open.

1858
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:21,650
After 9 p.m.

1859
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:22,650
I don't have a watch.

1860
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:24,390
Oh, we still don't have any jobs.

1861
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:28,350
Okay, we'll just follow where the game wants us to go.

1862
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:33,850
Wait, so I can go swimming in here?

1863
02:06:36,190 --> 02:06:37,310
Ooh, wow.

1864
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:39,510
This is really

1865
02:06:43,570 --> 02:06:52,910
Um, I think they're putting artificial dye in the lake, or it's contaminated, or something's wrong here.

1866
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:58,550
You know how, like, they'll put an artificial coloring in some water to make it look more appealing?

1867
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:01,490
Like, a lake should never look this blue.

1868
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:04,350
Yellowstone acid water.

1869
02:07:04,490 --> 02:07:05,410
Yeah, exactly.

1870
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:22,560
Go to your sleeping lodge, okay?

1871
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:27,390
My bad!

1872
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:33,090
Remember how I stressed the importance of learning how to swim earlier?

1873
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:39,740
Let's...

1874
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:39,920
Oh.

1875
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:40,920
Oh.

1876
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:42,340
You're okay, buddy.

1877
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:42,780
You're okay.

1878
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,460
You're fine.

1879
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:47,360
This place is humongous, though.

1880
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:49,760
Okay.

1881
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:50,300
You're okay.

1882
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:50,800
You're okay.

1883
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:52,980
Uh-oh.

1884
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:56,440
This place is dangerous and humongous.

1885
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:00,700
Does this not also have a door knob?

1886
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:01,720
I just push it open?

1887
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:02,140
Yep.

1888
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:06,400
Is this other people's stuff?

1889
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:08,980
Oh, checkers.

1890
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:10,760
Tags, exploration.

1891
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:11,800
You're right.

1892
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:16,460
I tried to explore the lake and we saw where that got me.

1893
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:20,960
Okay, I'm pressing, pressing, pressing, pressing, pressing, pressing, E.

1894
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:21,460
Oh, there.

1895
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:22,080
You can hear me.

1896
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:23,720
Head to the west side of the island.

1897
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:26,420
There is an old shed where you need to pick up some things for me.

1898
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:31,050
Okay.

1899
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,930
Don't go through the water, though.

1900
02:08:34,450 --> 02:08:35,650
You won't make it.

1901
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:42,590
You died.

1902
02:08:50,030 --> 02:08:50,470
Hi.

1903
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,370
Chad, I joined.

1904
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:55,090
It's late.

1905
02:08:55,130 --> 02:08:55,730
What's going on?

1906
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:57,610
We just started our third game.

1907
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:58,950
So...

1908
02:08:58,950 --> 02:08:59,050
Okay.

1909
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:26,590
um we are a guy oh i realized your vision like goes blurry i have to go in there that thing looks it looks like it'll collapse any second the uh lack of like wildlife and stuff is kind of freaking me out i don't know oh wow you think i'll die here too yeah we're a janitor for some reason I didn't know that a...

1910
02:09:27,530 --> 02:09:31,170
I mean, I guess places need to be cleaned up for sure.

1911
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,810
Wait, what's that over there?

1912
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:35,970
My brother never taught me how to swim.

1913
02:09:36,390 --> 02:09:36,650
No.

1914
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:40,570
Um...

1915
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:41,390
What was I gonna say?

1916
02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:45,710
I didn't realize that like camps needed like a janitor.

1917
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:59,230
The death screen is so abrupt.

1918
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:00,250
It's so funny.

1919
02:10:01,230 --> 02:10:03,570
It really is!

1920
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:04,570
Wait, do you think...

1921
02:10:04,910 --> 02:10:07,590
You think that guy that's broadcasting is up here?

1922
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:12,370
What if we go up there and it is a skelly man?

1923
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:17,030
And he's been dead the whole time!

1924
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,340
Tags exploration?

1925
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:24,940
Mystery solved.

1926
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,080
Bro died in 10 inches of water.

1927
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:35,760
So there's this lady on TikTok who every October she does spooky lake month.

1928
02:10:35,900 --> 02:11:04,240
And she starts her videos by going, um yes hello and so every time i hear that everybody knows always just like yeah it's spooky lake man it's spooky as she does every day she does a different spooky story about like like spooky like hydrology stuff like some lakes that are just kind of like a little freaky you know and there was one that she talked about the other day that was um it was

1929
02:11:07,720 --> 02:12:30,860
there was an active volcano it erupted and created a crater the crater filled up with water and the but the lake was extremely deep it was like super duper deep not like your average like it was it's much deeper than normal for some of some of these lakes and one night um the the volcano was still like you know somewhat active and so um and so it was like constantly releasing like little little gas bubbles you know of like yeah the gas buildup yes yes yes this is the story and it was constantly releasing like this carbon monoxide maybe but um yeah like a suit like just like you know i can't remember what exactly it was but eventually it like there was one night where um it like billowed over all it like yeah essentially let out like this nasty fart and the gas went rolled down the hill basically and there was a village kind of there was a village pretty close and the gas was so fast it was like 40 miles per hour and it rushed through this village which everybody just basically

1930
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:38,900
suffocated to death yeah the co2 and it killed it killed everybody it It killed all the animals.

1931
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:46,620
Like, they, one day, it was just, one day, literally a whole entire village was wiped out because of this one lake in their sleep.

1932
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,000
Like, you would never know it was coming because the gas was just so fast.

1933
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:53,920
And everybody was, was asleep.

1934
02:12:54,620 --> 02:13:02,860
And the, um, it took, like, several years for, like, they, people went to the village and noticed, like, all the animals dead, all the people dead.

1935
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:04,340
And they were like, what the heck happened?

1936
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:07,640
And it took, it took, you know, scientists and police.

1937
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:16,840
several years before they were like, oh, before they could like investigate and be like, oh, this is this is what happened to this whole what the

1938
02:13:19,890 --> 02:13:20,770
whole village?

1939
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:22,210
It's so freaky.

1940
02:13:22,410 --> 02:13:23,530
I wonder if there's fall damage.

1941
02:13:23,710 --> 02:13:24,670
Okay, we cannot check.

1942
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:30,630
Oh, oh, we're fine.

1943
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:32,050
Okay, anyway.

1944
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:34,950
I just wanted to share that because it was so fascinating.

1945
02:13:38,770 --> 02:14:11,550

Oh, binoculars.

1953
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,920
Bring the equipment to the tower.

1954
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:40,100
The firewatch tower?

1955
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:41,500
The tower.

1956
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,160
Which tower?

1957
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:49,800

Oh, yes, here.

1964
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,860

02:15:44,120 --> 02:15:46,420

02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:47,140
Oh, this radio.

1968
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:47,640

02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:33,460
Yeah, that was it.

1976
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:34,080

1978
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:38,080
It's dark.

1979
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,520

Whoa.

1995
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:21,000
Whoa.

1996
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:25,710
Did Mimi run out of the raid?

1997
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:30,470
It's starting to get spooky.

1998
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:32,230
What is this?

1999
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:32,710
Hmm.

2000
02:17:32,990 --> 02:17:33,610
What's this?

2001
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:34,610
Follow me.

2002
02:17:34,650 --> 02:17:36,170
I think I've seen this area before.

2003
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:38,710
Hmm.

2004
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:39,550
What's this?

2005
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:42,310
Do I go now?

2006
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:44,330
Oh, it's nighttime.

2007
02:17:44,630 --> 02:17:45,810
It says sleep through the night.

2008
02:17:46,290 --> 02:17:46,910
Investigate the...

2009
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:48,410
Forbidden area.

2010
02:17:52,710 --> 02:17:53,210
Meijmento?

2011
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:53,670
Yeah!

Happy...

2013
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:01,020
Am I...

2014
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:02,740
I don't want to fall into the water.

2015
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:03,780
Don't fall into the water.

2016
02:18:03,860 --> 02:18:04,620
We don't know how to swim.

2017
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:25,760

2020
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:08,660
Okay.

2021
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:17,900
Just use a stick, I don't know.

2022
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:26,360
Are you guys feeling the...

2023
02:19:26,360 --> 02:19:30,100
There was another game I almost picked up that like...

2024
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:34,020
It looked the... I couldn't tell what the game was like.

2025
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:36,520
It said it was like a survival horror game.

2026
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:39,360
So I was like, I don't know about this one today.

2027
02:19:39,920 --> 02:20:12,780
But the game itself looked very um like old like you know your your your Halloween when you were a child you know that kind of aesthetic where everything was like so decorated and fun weeks of fun weeks of fun nobody's gonna be up here are there where is the guy that should do the trick should do the drink.

2028
02:20:13,220 --> 02:20:15,240
That'd be good to have that out in general, no?

2029
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:20,820
Well, I thought I saw something lit up.

2030
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:24,200
What if it's aliens, just like in Firewatch?

2031
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:27,320
Oh, I might have seen the water peeking through.

2032
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,700
Why is that axe in the pillow?

2033
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:34,540
I know, right?

2034
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:37,020
When I first saw it, it was like, this is...

2035
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:40,020
I guess no comment about it.

2036
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,220
No worries about it.

2037
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:46,780
Is that a spoiler?

2038
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,740
What, fire watch?

2039
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:48,120
No.

2040
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:50,180
It's not.

2041
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:53,960
I wish the little marker didn't go away.

2042
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:58,400
This area, I don't like these little tents.

2043
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:01,280
There's something about them that's so freaky.

2044
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:10,240
I can't tell if it's because they look like body bags, like the size of them, or there's just, there's something I might run about them, Tans.

2045
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:12,320
I don't like it.

2046
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:16,960
Alright.

2047
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:48,340
and then once you chop this you're not you're gonna oh that was my own footsteps oh my gosh it scared me bingo okay now you're gonna take it back you're not gonna take it back okay bingo can i go through now oh okay bingo oh my god my god!

2048
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:50,100
Crazy!

2049
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:52,380
Wait, is that a person?

2050
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:53,460
Oh, nope.

2051
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,220
What am I doing over here anyway?

2052
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:04,840
I was curious about the thing on the other side of the island, so... You know me, I'm curious.

2053
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:06,620
I'm a curious cat.

2054
02:22:07,460 --> 02:22:08,620
Maybe that's why I'm dead.

2055
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:09,380
What's this?

2056
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:11,700
Oh, a generator, or a light?

2057
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:12,980
Okay.

2058
02:22:14,440 --> 02:22:16,100
Looks relatively new.

2059
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,120
Oh, What's this?

2060
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:20,380
A tape?

2061
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:21,200
A tape?

2062
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:23,380
Maybe it can give me some clues on what this is all about.

2063
02:22:24,340 --> 02:22:25,440
Oh no, is this slender?

2064
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:30,080
Collect all my tapes.

2065
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:31,740
Johnny boy.

2066
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:35,580
I gotta know though, what's the thing on the end of the island?

2067
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:38,580
Tags exploration?

2068
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:40,600
Wait, hmm?

2069
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:41,960
Wait, hmm?

2070
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:42,940
Oh.

2071
02:22:44,060 --> 02:22:44,500
Okay.

2072
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:46,660
I thought I was about to die.

2073
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:48,780
Don't go into the water!

2074
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:49,660
You can't swim!

2075
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:55,440
Hatch to nowhere, right?

2076
02:22:56,060 --> 02:22:56,940
A little strange.

2077
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:59,200
Am I at the right spot?

2078
02:23:00,860 --> 02:23:02,060
Maybe it's over there.

2079
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:05,220
Where am I?

2080
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:10,900
Return the Vod.

2081
02:23:11,780 --> 02:23:13,720
Or suffer my curse.

2082
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:18,560
We in slender now.

2083
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,080
Did you guys ever play Slender?

2084
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:22,680
Like the original game?

2085
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:25,420
Actually, I was thinking about it the other day.

2086
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:28,820
And I was like, I don't know if I actually ever played Slender.

2087
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:33,540
I might have, but I don't...

2088
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:34,720
Oh, it was a toilet!

2089
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:37,220
I thought so!

2090
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:44,600
Someone's taking the most scenic piss of their life out here.

2091
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:49,720
PewDiePie play it.

2092
02:23:52,220 --> 02:23:56,180
I think I watched someone play it many years after.

2093
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:58,620
But I did watch Marvel Hornet.

2094
02:24:07,330 --> 02:24:07,990
I don't know.

2095
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:09,610
Maybe I played it but didn't beat it.

2096
02:24:09,870 --> 02:24:10,710
I just don't remember.

2097
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:19,870
PewDiePie, he's a grandpa.

2098
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,990
He's a grandpa?

2099
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:24,930
Wait, actually?

2100
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:28,910
How old is his kid?

2101
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:29,370
Oh,

2102
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:35,420
he's not.

2103
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:43,880
His son is four at E3.

2104
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:50,310
This kid is four?

2105
02:24:51,330 --> 02:24:53,230
Me when I spread misinformation.

2106
02:24:54,190 --> 02:24:56,810
I feel like I'm about to get a key and open the TV room.

2107
02:24:56,970 --> 02:24:57,890
Well, where do I get the key?

2108
02:24:58,190 --> 02:24:59,770
But where would I even play this?

2109
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:01,570
Wait.

2110
02:25:02,410 --> 02:25:03,330
The TV room.

2111
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:04,070
Oh, look.

2112
02:25:04,310 --> 02:25:05,130
It was locked.

2113
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:07,990
Maybe the key is still in the reception.

2114
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:09,610
Okay, we're going to reception.

2115
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:12,550
But, like, where would I even play this?

2116
02:25:12,650 --> 02:25:19,430
This guy is, he was so serious about wanting to find his brother, and now he's like, like, where do I even play this?

2117
02:25:20,350 --> 02:25:21,530
Like, where is, oh, there it is.

2118
02:25:22,730 --> 02:25:23,670
Are we going to get in trouble?

2119
02:25:25,010 --> 02:25:25,250
Fool?

2120
02:25:27,250 --> 02:25:30,310
Had a drinking buddy in college who often insisted we co-op slender.

2121
02:25:30,450 --> 02:25:33,330
Usually involved me navigating the game and him running out of the room.

2122
02:25:34,890 --> 02:25:35,370
Go, Vito!

2123
02:25:35,550 --> 02:25:36,470
The ghost in frills.

2124
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:40,070
That's me.

2125
02:25:41,570 --> 02:25:42,710
Okay, so we go to reception.

2126
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:47,720
Okay.

2127
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:50,380
Okay.

2128
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:54,180
I'm running, running, running.

2129
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:56,660
Don't want to pass out, though.

2130
02:25:56,920 --> 02:25:58,340
Oh, oh, okay, there's our marker.

2131
02:26:05,250 --> 02:26:07,590
Guys, voice acting is flatter than my OC!

2132
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:10,710
Ow, hold on.

2133
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:12,090
Just our dang second.

2134
02:26:18,660 --> 02:26:20,000
Oh, this way.

2135
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:25,470
Where is that guy that was over this?

2136
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:26,630
Where does that guy sleep?

2137
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:27,910
Where?

2138
02:26:28,090 --> 02:26:29,110
Why is nobody here?

2139
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:30,830
Why does this place need a janitor?

2140
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:37,350
Like, I thought we were going to work...

2141
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:41,210
Like, janitor implies, like, a school or an office building.

2142
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:41,730
Something.

2143
02:26:43,150 --> 02:26:44,430
This is just a dang...

2144
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:49,920
Uh...

2145
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:55,000
It's just a run-down park.

2146
02:26:58,360 --> 02:27:00,240
Did that door just open itself?

2147
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:04,180
Wait, can we not go in here?

2148
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:06,800
So, wait, is that the...

2149
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:10,200
Watch the tape in the TV room?

2150
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:16,760
One really funny thing about, like, Unity...

2151
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:21,740
Is it has given the ability for anybody to make a beautiful game...

2152
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:57,700
but not everybody has the ability to make a good game you'll get you'll get was it this one oh yeah okay my game saved oh no wait they never came back who will stop using this font please I can't read it whoever left this behind wanted someone to watch it.

2153
02:27:58,100 --> 02:28:00,220
Let's see what they were so desperate to show.

2154
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:02,700
Oh my

2155
02:28:07,710 --> 02:28:09,090
gosh, it's just like the ring.

2156
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:11,890
Seven days, seven days.

2157
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:19,240
What is happening?

2158
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:20,620
I can't tell.

2159
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:41,200
Noon.

2160
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:50,060
Oh, now we're playing the game in in

2161
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,400
Wait, we're playing...

2162
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:58,700
Ooh, we're playing a movie game.

2163
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:01,080
Great, I guess flashlights are overrated anyways.

2164
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:02,440
Oh, that's what that was?

2165
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:02,780
Okay.

2166
02:29:06,380 --> 02:29:07,260
Go this way?

2167
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:08,560
Wait, I have to...

2168
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:09,600
Okay, we can't go this way.

2169
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,000
Just kidding.

2170
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:12,720
Oh, wait, I forgot I have to push open the doors, right?

2171
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:14,900
This better not become Outlast.

2172
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:17,280
Okay, I don't push open the doors.

2173
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:19,120
These ones actually have handles.

2174
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:19,560
Just kidding.

2175
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:21,840
What is this game about?

2176
02:29:21,900 --> 02:29:22,740
I have no idea.

2177
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:24,080
Okay.

2178
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:25,600
Oh.

2179
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:26,640
Oh.

2180
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:37,920
Beep, beep, beep.

2181
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:39,640
Wait.

2182
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:41,320
Eight.

2183
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:43,420
Zero, zero, eight.

2184
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:46,300
Yeah!

2185
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:53,100
So, wait, is it this one?

2186
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,220
It is.

2187
02:29:57,300 --> 02:29:58,920
Oh, but I don't have my flashlight.

2188
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:00,200
It's too dark.

2189
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:02,120
It's too dark.

2190
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:03,280
Oh yeah.

2191
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:04,200
Welcome.

2192
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:06,060
Just start employing it here.

2193
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:07,260
Since you are

2194
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:12,320
the...

2195
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:13,060
Oh, hours.

2196
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:14,540
You will receive a credit to

2197
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:18,520
your...

2198
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:20,440
Just random person.

2199
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:22,500
And their brains!

2200
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:27,240
This is not what monitors should look like.

2201
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:30,160
What am I doing?

2202
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:32,900
Find the code to open the door.

2203
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,100
Okay, I feel like I'm gonna get chased in here.

2204
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:39,180
I'm gonna find the code and then something's gonna run at me.

2205
02:30:39,620 --> 02:30:39,720
Oh.

2206
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:43,380
red over there.

2207
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,060
Yeah, they just put their family...

2208
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:49,600
Oh, wait!

2209
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:50,860
Seven.

2210
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:52,520
Oh, seven!

2211
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:54,760
Wait, did the other one have one?

2212
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:58,720
No.

2213
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:01,400
Why is there red sometimes?

2214
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:02,400
You guys see that, right?

2215
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:05,140
What's this game called?

2216
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:11,020
Mumble Pines.

2217
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:11,800
Oh!

2218
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:16,010
Is it a...

2219
02:31:16,030 --> 02:31:19,450
I can't tell, I'm scared.

2220
02:31:20,770 --> 02:31:21,490
Turn off the flashlight.

2221
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:27,170
I didn't realize it was on because before it was off, right?

2222
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:33,740
Oh, I think it's just...

2223
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:34,700
Oh, it's electricity.

2224
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,200
Oh, okay.

2225
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:37,540
We're fine.

2226
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,900
So, seven...

2227
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:45,870
Uh...

2228
02:31:50,730 --> 02:31:51,330
Okay.

2229
02:31:52,930 --> 02:31:53,530
Wow.

2230
02:31:53,930 --> 02:31:54,270
Or...

2231
02:31:59,150 --> 02:31:59,790
Seven...

2232
02:32:01,570 --> 02:32:02,210
Seven...

2233
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:12,940
Maybe I have to turn it off for some of the other paintings or pictures as well.

2234
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:13,680
Oh wait!

2235
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:15,140
One?

2236
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:21,140
I can't... I guess not.

2237
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:21,700
Never mind.

2238
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:24,400
You just have to find them.

2239
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:27,140
Eight?

2240
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:29,080
Aw, the bear.

2241
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:31,920
Seven, one, eight.

2242
02:32:36,140 --> 02:33:08,080

2243
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,080
I don't care if he knows my boss.

2244
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:11,340
What?

2245
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:14,980
Why did you write that down?

2246
02:33:19,440 --> 02:33:20,320
Oh, three!

2247
02:33:22,020 --> 02:33:23,740
Seven, one, eight, three.

2248
02:33:25,820 --> 02:33:27,480
But how am I supposed to know the order?

2249
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:30,180
Oh, wait!

2250
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:32,500
The order is this.

2251
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:35,180
So teddy bear.

2252
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:37,560
Teddy bear glasses.

2253
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:38,480
So three.

2254
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:45,240
Dang it.

2255
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:46,060
Okay.

2256
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:48,200
I have to go find them again.

2257
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:53,580
So, eight three.

2258
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:54,920
Eight three.

2259
02:34:00,710 --> 02:34:02,210
Eight three seven one.

2260
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:08,180
Oh my gosh.

2261
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:08,540
Scary.

2262
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:10,240
Wait, how do I get out of here?

2263
02:34:12,860 --> 02:34:13,980
Oh, over here.

2264
02:34:15,640 --> 02:34:15,880
Nope.

2265
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:16,600
Just kidding.

2266
02:34:19,580 --> 02:34:21,680
Well, as soon as I'm right here, I guess I can check.

2267
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:28,580
The alcoholic is the last one, so...

2268
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:34,570
Yeah, 8371.

2269
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:39,540
Eh?

2270
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:42,920
Stinking maze.

2271
02:34:46,530 --> 02:34:49,190
Haskaido for making this such a cozy horror street boss.

2272
02:34:49,330 --> 02:34:51,410
Wait, where did my dummy friend go?

2273
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,870
Oh, da-da!

2274
02:34:54,110 --> 02:34:55,250
Your dummy friend.

2275
02:34:56,670 --> 02:35:02,150
8, wait, 8, wait, 8, 3, 7, 1.

2276
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:04,730
Ding-ba!

2277
02:35:06,170 --> 02:35:07,610
Also, thank you so much, Miro!

2278
02:35:07,810 --> 02:35:08,770
Glad you're liking it.

2279
02:35:09,490 --> 02:35:10,910
Let's see what this door is hiding.

2280
02:35:12,470 --> 02:35:12,990
Uh...

2281
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:40,700
I didn't, I didn't learn literally anything about the game.

2282
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:42,240
game from this demo.

2283
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:48,040
I don't know anything is going on.

2284
02:35:57,290 --> 02:36:00,150
I hate to say it, but full playthrough win.

2285
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:06,490
Okay.

2286
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:07,510
All right.

2287
02:36:08,010 --> 02:36:08,370
All right.

2288
02:36:09,330 --> 02:36:17,130
I have one last game demo that I downloaded, which maybe you guys have heard of this series.

2289
02:36:17,450 --> 02:36:37,660
So similar to how I started with Achilla's art game, with another game that is a little well-known in that game we'll just load it up now oh hold on let me capture it

2290
02:36:41,290 --> 02:36:57,890
uh Why isn't it capturing?

2291
02:37:02,100 --> 02:37:02,440
Ah!

2292
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:06,180
I'm on observation duty!

2293
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:07,040
Hey!

2294
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:15,700
I'll need your guys' eyes to find some anomalies!

2295
02:37:17,220 --> 02:37:20,300
So I guess there's an eighth one coming out!

2296
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:27,720
And from the screenshots, there was an observation duty game where you were able to walk around.

2297
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:41,060
and find the anomalies and I guess that this one is also that style right behind me it says navigate so I know right there's eight of these games

2298
02:37:44,700 --> 02:38:03,920
so yeah started with chill as art and ending with observation duty let's check it out oh whoa attention employee anomalies have been previously cited in the monitored area Pay extremely close attention to the surveillance camera footage.

2299
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:10,020
File an anomaly a report, ASAP, when you notice something has changed.

2300
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:11,520
I'll need your guys' help, okay?

2301
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:15,540
There's a purple anomaly in the bottom right now!

2302
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:18,320
Oh, wait, maybe I can't walk around then.

2303
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:20,400
Okay, let's look.

2304
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:22,200
We're at a yard?

2305
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:23,800
Oh, keep...

2306
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:24,840
Oh, it's a lighthouse!

2307
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:28,180
Oh, it's kind of freaky.

2308
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:31,100
Okay.

2309
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:32,260
Whoa.

2310
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:33,860
Purple.

2311
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:37,620
Okay.

2312
02:38:39,380 --> 02:38:41,360
Well, what am I supposed to...

2313
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:45,540
Okay, so far.

2314
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:47,720
Everything seems fine.

2315
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:48,640
All right, guys.

2316
02:38:51,480 --> 02:38:56,600
It's the anticipation of like moving to the next camera that freaks me out a little bit, you know?

2317
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:59,320
It is really detailed.

2318
02:38:59,500 --> 02:38:59,940
Like, this?

2319
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:02,260
This part looks great.

2320
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:03,900
Oh, oops, not bad.

2321
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:04,840
Basement.

2322
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:07,540
They got a rat problem.

2323
02:39:10,780 --> 02:39:11,940
This is so chill.

2324
02:39:14,980 --> 02:39:16,060
Why is she orple?

2325
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:18,620
Because I'm getting into the Halloween spirit.

2326
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:21,180
I am the spirit.

2327
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:25,040
I'm also really bad at these games, you guys.

2328
02:39:25,480 --> 02:39:28,020
So, this is why I don't really play.

2329
02:39:28,200 --> 02:39:31,380
Anomaly type games because I'm terrible at them.

2330
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:36,020
There's going to be a body in that bed.

2331
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:37,760
Probably.

2332
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:45,620
This would be a fun collab game.

2333
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:46,500
I was thinking that too.

2334
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:49,020
It's always nice to have an extra...

2335
02:39:49,020 --> 02:39:49,760
Oh, there's teeth!

2336
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:54,080
It's always nice to have an extra pair of eyes on these types of things, you know?

2337
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:59,200
I'm really bad at like memorizing everything.

2338
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:00,680
So...

2339
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,560
Was this moving before?

2340
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,140
I feel like it probably was.

2341
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,540
See, I'm so unobservant.

2342
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:13,660
I imagined it was because it controls this.

2343
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:19,000
Wait, but how...

2344
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,140
Before there was a light.

2345
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,840
Oh, maybe it was the shadow passing by.

2346
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:31,520
You know, they're always just like, count the number of bottles, count the colors, count everything.

2347
02:40:33,040 --> 02:41:05,620
present and future oh we're underwater um whoa uh how do i describe this um uh oh here we go uh water anomaly probably in the yard so left click has you click on certain things and right click has you do the entire area.

2348
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:07,240
Good to know.

2349
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:08,440
Good to know.

2350
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:10,460
That one was kind of neat.

2351
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:13,200
I'll take I'm in Observation Duty.

2352
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:14,380
Wait.

2353
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:17,960
I'm on Observation Duty is the paranormal activity of horror games at this point.

2354
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,280
Unique and fun at first but a dozen mid sequels.

2355
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:22,900
Oh, was it?

2356
02:41:22,960 --> 02:41:23,300
Oh, wait.

2357
02:41:23,460 --> 02:41:24,780
I don't think this was here before.

2358
02:41:25,720 --> 02:41:26,200
X drop.

2359
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:27,720
Maybe?

2360
02:41:32,040 --> 02:42:16,400
I think, you know, they concept of like the anomaly game um wait what's this was this here before always i'm not sure i don't know i think these games can definitely be hit or miss especially if like nothing happens in the game which tends to happen quite a bit that's also another reason i don't play them very often but i still think they're fine i think they're a nice game for sure yeah the graphics are getting this one looks really good i hope that we get to play not just this one what time do we go until

2361
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:27,980
spooky cozy yeah there's a genre i definitely think that's a there's a there's a place for spooky cozy you know

2362
02:42:31,100 --> 02:42:52,200
but you know now we have so many anomaly type games where it's like exit a is one of them that got a whole movie like they definitely popularized the the concept was the rat trap always in the interior these ones yeah sorry

2363
02:42:59,130 --> 02:43:06,190
it's brighter what's brighter here in here you think it's brighter in here than before

2364
02:43:09,430 --> 02:43:27,270
try oh interior not basement oh oh this i don't know i don't know it's a great question

2365
02:43:33,650 --> 02:43:51,470
i wonder if we'll get anything crazy i wonder if it's like more scripted because it's demo you know definitely interested new lamp where ah this changed uh object replacement probably

2366
02:43:55,890 --> 02:44:18,880
what no it was a different type no this was definitely missing it was a different type of cross object movement okay yeah I had a circle top it did it did yeah let's try another one I don't want to get in trouble though Missing object?

2367
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:23,200
I tried object replacement, it didn't work.

2368
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:34,080
Oh, it is that type of cross.

2369
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:36,200
It was missing the floaty.

2370
02:44:37,420 --> 02:44:38,660
Oh, I see.

2371
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:41,160
I observe a cute ghost in the corner.

2372
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:42,640
Oh,

2373
02:44:48,250 --> 02:44:49,450
spooky.

2374
02:44:50,750 --> 02:44:52,390
Object movement?

2375
02:44:54,450 --> 02:44:54,930
Freaky.

2376
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:09,020
Image anomaly?

2377
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:10,320
Yeah, let's try that.

2378
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:12,380
That sounds like it could be right.

2379
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:15,600
Okay.

2380
02:45:16,580 --> 02:45:17,440
Good job, team.

2381
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:18,560
Good job, team.

2382
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,100
Sometimes they're so obvious.

2383
02:45:21,180 --> 02:45:23,760
Obviously, like, the obvious ones like that I can get.

2384
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:27,120
The cross one, I had been looking at it every time.

2385
02:45:27,580 --> 02:45:29,980
So, I was like, Hmm.

2386
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,620
Hmm.

2387
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:34,020
I think I'll get that one.

2388
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:38,700
But...

2389
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:44,860
So far so good.

2390
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:45,820
Yeah, maybe.

2391
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:46,820
I think.

2392
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:49,400
Maybe.

2393
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:54,600
Hmm.

2394
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:56,660
Hmm.

2395
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:58,280
Hmm.

2396
02:45:58,500 --> 02:45:59,380
Hmm.

2397
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:01,940
I need to start looking in here.

2398
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:04,100
I've been only looking on the outside.

2399
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:10,720
I feel like something's going to happen with this thing here.

2400
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,100
Whirlpool.

2401
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:16,440
Ah, yeah!

2402
02:46:16,780 --> 02:46:20,080
Oh, we have an abyss in the basement.

2403
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:23,720
And it's screaming.

2404
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:26,220
What?

2405
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:28,020
Uh, we have...

2406
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:28,820
Uh...

2407
02:46:29,400 --> 02:46:30,420
We have a hole.

2408
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:31,340
Oh, it's a hole.

2409
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:35,600
We have a hole in the basement.

2410
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,380
Okay, I'll fix.

2411
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:42,340
They're so efficient.

2412
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,420
I wonder how long this demo will be.

2413
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:55,680
Okay.

2414
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:58,940
So far, the game looks really good, though.

2415
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:06,120
I wonder if we'll get, like, an anomaly on each map.

2416
02:47:06,260 --> 02:47:08,520
Well, I guess maybe we...

2417
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:11,240
Actually, we probably just played the night on only this map, I imagine.

2418
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,440
I don't know.

2419
02:47:16,390 --> 02:47:16,830
Oh,

2420
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:21,560
that's the wind, I think.

2421
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:22,560
I thought I heard something.

2422
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:26,300
Hmm.

2423
02:47:30,260 --> 02:47:30,700
Hmm.

2424
02:47:32,560 --> 02:47:33,000
Hmm.

2425
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:34,180
Hmm.

2426
02:47:35,700 --> 02:47:35,920
Hmm.

2427
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:36,020
Hmm.

2428
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:40,500
Yeah, it's like Phenaf where it ends at six.

2429
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:40,800
Yeah.

2430
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:41,100
Yeah.

2431
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:43,560
Yeah, you guys are right.

2432
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:46,120
There's like a little symbol down here.

2433
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:46,720
You see that?

2434
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:47,720
It seems kind of like...

2435
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:48,800
creepy.

2436
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:51,040
Hey!

2437
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:52,400
Christ Jesus.

2438
02:47:54,900 --> 02:47:56,020
Every time!

2439
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,300
Every time.

2440
02:47:59,200 --> 02:47:59,700
Man.

2441
02:48:01,940 --> 02:48:02,000
Okay.

2442
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:07,420
Ugh.

2443
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:13,700
Well, we're not getting in trouble yet, though.

2444
02:48:16,340 --> 02:48:18,340
So that's a... that's a plus?

2445
02:48:18,940 --> 02:48:19,640
That's good.

2446
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:22,760
Uh, orpoh.

2447
02:48:25,140 --> 02:48:26,080
Not sure.

2448
02:48:26,920 --> 02:48:27,620
I'm looking.

2449
02:48:29,380 --> 02:48:29,720
Window.

2450
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:32,240
What window?

2451
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:37,550
Is this map a reference to a movie?

2452
02:48:37,790 --> 02:48:38,210
I don't know.

2453
02:48:39,370 --> 02:48:40,650
Not sure, actually.

2454
02:48:41,610 --> 02:48:43,370
I thought this was a person for a second.

2455
02:48:43,770 --> 02:48:44,290
Spook me.

2456
02:48:44,970 --> 02:48:46,350
Missing handrail on the stairwell.

2457
02:48:47,710 --> 02:48:48,490
Is there?

2458
02:48:49,710 --> 02:48:50,790
These windows?

2459
02:48:51,490 --> 02:48:52,090
Is there something?

2460
02:48:52,530 --> 02:48:53,710
I don't see anything.

2461
02:48:55,630 --> 02:48:58,190
Could you guys ever live in a lighthouse?

2462
02:48:58,450 --> 02:48:59,950
Could you guys ever be a lighthouse keeper?

2463
02:49:01,090 --> 02:49:01,890
I don't think I could.

2464
02:49:03,690 --> 02:49:04,990
I don't think I could.

2465
02:49:05,290 --> 02:49:15,690
Like, I've thought about Firewatch maybe, but also, then I, you know, I've watched a lot of videos that kind of romanticize the Firewatch occupation.

2466
02:49:18,010 --> 02:49:28,450
I watched one, I watched one single Firewatch video that was like, here is the realistic, here is the real, like, facts.

2467
02:49:28,630 --> 02:49:33,790
This is like real, realness about Firewatch, being a Firewatch person.

2468
02:49:35,490 --> 02:49:40,110
And I was like, I was like, okay, never mind, I changed my mind.

2469
02:49:43,430 --> 02:49:46,670
I don't actually mind probably being alone.

2470
02:49:46,970 --> 02:49:48,850
I think actually That's the part that...

2471
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:50,050
Eee!

2472
02:49:54,030 --> 02:49:54,750
Um...

2473
02:49:54,750 --> 02:49:55,510
Uh...

2474
02:49:55,510 --> 02:49:56,510
Rope Anomaly!

2475
02:50:02,470 --> 02:50:03,190
Wee!

2476
02:50:07,030 --> 02:50:10,590
Creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy crawlies!

2477
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:12,950
Oh, it's funny.

2478
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:14,650
Um, but yeah.

2479
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:15,750
I don't know.

2480
02:50:16,070 --> 02:50:16,430
Anomaly.

2481
02:50:16,630 --> 02:50:17,810
Ghost in bottom right corner?

2482
02:50:18,510 --> 02:50:18,950
No!

2483
02:50:20,210 --> 02:50:21,590
Thank you so much.

2484
02:50:22,270 --> 02:50:23,150
Thank you!

2485
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:25,690
Ah!

2486
02:50:26,770 --> 02:50:27,750
Change color.

2487
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:30,190
Object replacement.

2488
02:50:30,850 --> 02:50:31,210
Probably.

2489
02:50:33,470 --> 02:50:34,010
Not Orpal!

2490
02:50:34,330 --> 02:50:34,930
Not Orpal!

2491
02:50:38,650 --> 02:50:41,410
On this specific rope anomaly.

2492
02:50:41,710 --> 02:50:43,210
I guess because they're like...

2493
02:50:43,210 --> 02:50:44,750
How else would you describe it, huh?

2494
02:50:45,610 --> 02:50:48,030
They add an extra option for us.

2495
02:50:49,690 --> 02:50:50,110
Hmm.

2496
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:52,250
Okay.

2497
02:50:52,270 --> 02:51:00,950
But yeah, I think probably Lighthouse Keeper is maybe a little similar to Firewatch.

2498
02:51:01,330 --> 02:51:04,870
But the thing about Firewatch was like, maybe I could do Lighthouse.

2499
02:51:05,170 --> 02:51:08,350
But also, Lighthouse creeped me out so much.

2500
02:51:10,070 --> 02:51:13,530
About Firewatch though, they were like, yeah, you can't really bathe.

2501
02:51:13,730 --> 02:51:17,070
And I was like, no!

2502
02:51:18,750 --> 02:51:20,690
Change color, it's lilac now.

2503
02:51:22,650 --> 02:51:24,750
Lighthouses seem more homey?

2504
02:51:25,130 --> 02:51:27,130
See, not at night though.

2505
02:51:27,250 --> 02:51:28,910
They creep me out, I think.

2506
02:51:29,590 --> 02:51:33,290
There's too many horror games and stuff that take place in a lighthouse.

2507
02:51:35,330 --> 02:51:38,890
And I've heard too many freaky stories.

2508
02:51:49,980 --> 02:51:51,320
Lighthouse Willem DeFoe.

2509
02:51:51,620 --> 02:51:52,680
I haven't watched that movie.

2510
02:51:54,100 --> 02:51:55,540
Isn't Robert Pattinson in it too?

2511
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:00,460
I'm sure you've seen the movie.

2512
02:52:00,660 --> 02:52:01,620
I haven't, I haven't.

2513
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:03,930
I just know about it, but I haven't seen it.

2514
02:52:06,480 --> 02:52:08,620
I wonder if we'll get something really freaky.

2515
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:08,900
Oh!

2516
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:09,900
Uh-oh.

2517
02:52:10,300 --> 02:52:11,180
Oh, no, guys!

2518
02:52:11,540 --> 02:52:12,640
Uh-oh, we're in trouble!

2519
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:15,820
Multiple active anomalies?

2520
02:52:16,860 --> 02:52:17,100
What?

2521
02:52:17,180 --> 02:52:17,980
What am I missing?

2522
02:52:19,540 --> 02:52:19,960
Eh!

2523
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:21,240
Eh!

2524
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:39,050
The lamp differed in Lighthouse and Keeper's...

2525
02:52:39,050 --> 02:52:39,950
This one?

2526
02:52:48,910 --> 02:52:49,410
No!

2527
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:52,670
I need

2528
02:52:57,490 --> 02:53:29,930
more obvious anomalies I'm stupid please I don't know I have no idea but stairwell handrail left of pillar what is it missing needs more yellow paint ah thank you thank you thank you the light in the building on the dock was off when you started Oh, I see.

2529
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:31,030
Okay, let's go to there.

2530
02:53:32,210 --> 02:53:32,630
Are you sure?

2531
02:53:34,690 --> 02:53:35,570
Dead body.

2532
02:53:36,670 --> 02:53:37,170
I don't know.

2533
02:53:37,310 --> 02:53:40,770
I feel like, well, maybe light anomaly in the pier.

2534
02:53:41,230 --> 02:53:41,810
Let's try it.

2535
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:47,120
No.

2536
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:48,180
Maybe not.

2537
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:49,960
Unless I'm doing the wrong thing.

2538
02:53:50,060 --> 02:53:51,260
I thought it was on, though.

2539
02:53:57,380 --> 02:54:00,680
We have an abyss problem, everybody, in the keeper's cabin.

2540
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:04,880
Um, we have an abyss problem.

2541
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:07,400
Can I get...

2542
02:54:07,400 --> 02:54:09,700
There's a barrel on the top of the hill in the yard.

2543
02:54:10,440 --> 02:54:11,460
It was not there before.

2544
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:14,080
This one?

2545
02:54:16,240 --> 02:54:17,020
Extra object?

2546
02:54:17,220 --> 02:54:18,020
Or this one?

2547
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:20,740
I'll try both.

2548
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:22,560
No?

2549
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:23,220
This one.

2550
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:25,760
Extra object.

2551
02:54:31,070 --> 02:54:31,550
Nice!

2552
02:54:31,910 --> 02:54:32,390
Catch!

2553
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:34,190
You guys have such good eyes.

2554
02:54:35,130 --> 02:54:36,250
Nice catch!

2555
02:54:36,630 --> 02:54:37,530
Nice catch!

2556
02:54:38,270 --> 02:54:44,330
It's always harder for me, too, because I'm less focused on the game and totally more focused on you guys, like, reading chat.

2557
02:54:45,470 --> 02:54:45,710
Wait.

2558
02:54:47,070 --> 02:54:49,030
Were these here before, or am I crazy?

2559
02:54:49,650 --> 02:54:52,050
Yes, this was here before, right?

2560
02:54:54,770 --> 02:54:56,270
The lantern is off.

2561
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:57,230
This?

2562
02:54:57,490 --> 02:54:59,810
I think it was always off, or maybe it wasn't.

2563
02:55:04,530 --> 02:55:06,970
She's obsessed with us!

2564
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:09,790
Maybe a little.

2565
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:28,310
Maybe we're okay now though, we got a couple.

2566
02:55:30,810 --> 02:55:32,030
Was this mug always here?

2567
02:55:32,510 --> 02:55:33,210
I'm gonna try.

2568
02:55:40,010 --> 02:55:40,130
Ah!

2569
02:55:41,010 --> 02:55:41,290
Ah!

2570
02:55:42,210 --> 02:55:42,890
I did that!

2571
02:55:52,600 --> 02:55:53,180
Okay!

2572
02:55:54,380 --> 02:55:56,020
Good job team, good job!

2573
02:55:57,740 --> 02:55:59,880
that fine to you, the viewer.

2574
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:06,640
It always feels good when you find something like that, you know?

2575
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:14,000
Where you're like, I think my intuition is saying something.

2576
02:56:16,460 --> 02:56:17,820
To me, to you!

2577
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:20,900
Me?

2578
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:22,320
To me.

2579
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:35,120
I want a big freaky one.

2580
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:39,300
Give me a big freaky anomaly.

2581
02:56:40,380 --> 02:56:42,040
Give me the big man.

2582
02:56:42,520 --> 02:56:43,800
Give me the big man.

2583
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:46,080
Bigger man.

2584
02:56:47,720 --> 02:56:48,540
Extra bottle.

2585
02:56:50,120 --> 02:56:51,640
Where are we at?

2586
02:56:52,420 --> 02:56:55,240
Like, even the shadows from, like, the fireplace.

2587
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:59,060
Like, moving around, flickering like that.

2588
02:56:59,220 --> 02:56:59,720
I don't know.

2589
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:01,320
I'm, you know, I'm not a game designer.

2590
02:57:01,340 --> 02:57:13,040
I don't know how easy or difficult things are nowadays with like getting assets and stuff from the stores, but it's just it's like a little detail like that that I like.

2591
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:15,580
The extra mousetrap is concealed by the crates.

2592
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:19,890
This one?

2593
02:57:21,170 --> 02:57:22,790
This one has always been here.

2594
02:57:24,210 --> 02:57:25,110
Is this an extra one?

2595
02:57:31,160 --> 02:57:32,200
The left one.

2596
02:57:32,940 --> 02:57:33,660
This one?

2597
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:35,740
This one's always been here though.

2598
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,360
I swear there's an extra mousetrap in the basement.

2599
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:42,940
No, there's always been this.

2600
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:43,980
I've always noticed these three.

2601
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:46,520
Actually, this one I haven't noticed before because it was so dark.

2602
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:48,680
Oh.

2603
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:51,060
My bad.

2604
02:57:51,160 --> 02:57:51,660
It's okay.

2605
02:57:52,180 --> 02:57:52,480
Ah!

2606
02:57:52,860 --> 02:57:53,180
Sorry.

2607
02:57:55,220 --> 02:57:56,760
No worries at all.

2608
02:57:58,480 --> 02:57:59,760
Look at the fourth one.

2609
02:58:00,500 --> 02:58:00,900
I did.

2610
02:58:01,300 --> 02:58:02,340
I did try this one.

2611
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:04,480
Let's keep going, though.

2612
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:06,860
I don't want to stay in one spot for too long, you know?

2613
02:58:07,540 --> 02:58:08,660
Just in case.

2614
02:58:10,160 --> 02:58:10,400
Ah!

2615
02:58:10,900 --> 02:58:12,020
Is there a person?

2616
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:14,240
Um, uh, intruder.

2617
02:58:17,440 --> 02:58:18,440
The window.

2618
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:20,140
Creepy!

2619
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:23,560
Oh,

2620
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:29,040
what if we had gone in here?

2621
02:58:29,500 --> 02:58:31,020
Well, they were in the window.

2622
02:58:31,300 --> 02:58:31,500
Ah!

2623
02:58:44,370 --> 02:58:44,950
Intruder!

2624
02:58:49,410 --> 02:58:52,390
This is not... this is an extra object, right?

2625
02:58:53,010 --> 02:58:53,970
Oh my gosh!

2626
02:58:54,430 --> 02:58:55,630
That got me good!

2627
02:58:55,870 --> 02:58:57,590
That got me good!

2628
02:58:59,690 --> 02:59:00,670
Holy cow!

2629
02:59:01,170 --> 02:59:01,430
Ah!

2630
02:59:03,150 --> 02:59:09,250
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I asked for something freaky, you guys.

2631
02:59:09,450 --> 02:59:10,230
I think I got it.

2632
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:27,980
anxiety why was it so slow maybe that was pop-up was because he was in the place oh my god

2633
02:59:33,160 --> 02:59:44,520
wait this is this is different right room manipulation oh my gosh that was so freaky

2634
02:59:51,130 --> 02:59:52,130
Holy cow.

2635
02:59:52,830 --> 02:59:54,690
I asked for something freaky, man.

2636
02:59:54,810 --> 02:59:56,370
Wait, was this always flammable?

2637
02:59:59,130 --> 03:00:00,430
Object replacement, maybe?

2638
03:00:02,710 --> 03:00:04,710
Was that our Uber Eats delivery guy?

2639
03:00:05,870 --> 03:00:06,770
I guess not.

2640
03:00:09,490 --> 03:00:12,310
I was about to head to bed now, I'm not so sure.

2641
03:00:12,650 --> 03:00:13,590
I'm sorry!

2642
03:00:15,130 --> 03:00:15,950
Sorry, guys.

2643
03:00:16,210 --> 03:00:16,970
That was me.

2644
03:00:17,990 --> 03:00:20,330
You need to quit being so freaky now, okay?

2645
03:00:20,350 --> 03:00:23,850
Were these boxes always so green?

2646
03:00:26,310 --> 03:00:26,790
That was spooky.

2647
03:00:27,010 --> 03:00:27,710
Don't scare us like that.

2648
03:00:27,870 --> 03:00:29,030
I'm sorry for screaming.

2649
03:00:29,350 --> 03:00:30,350
I'm so sorry.

2650
03:00:34,340 --> 03:00:37,380
I'm so sorry for screaming like that.

2651
03:00:49,310 --> 03:00:50,070
Freaky.

2652
03:00:50,910 --> 03:00:51,670
Freaky, freaky.

2653
03:00:53,810 --> 03:00:55,070
I screamed too.

2654
03:00:56,730 --> 03:01:00,070
The flash, like the jump scare.

2655
03:01:00,990 --> 03:01:01,350
Okay.

2656
03:01:03,890 --> 03:01:09,910
I guess they do that to be like, hey, this guy is in the location.

2657
03:01:10,070 --> 03:01:11,870
Like he's somewhere on the camera somewhere.

2658
03:01:12,030 --> 03:01:12,830
You have to find them.

2659
03:01:13,690 --> 03:01:16,450
But I thought it was related to the guy in the window.

2660
03:01:17,570 --> 03:01:18,830
Oh, we got a bird.

2661
03:01:19,390 --> 03:01:20,910
Wait, my head is kind of blocking him, though.

2662
03:01:21,970 --> 03:01:23,630
Let me move down.

2663
03:01:23,770 --> 03:01:24,730
Just a tad, actually.

2664
03:01:25,830 --> 03:01:26,710
I'll move like here.

2665
03:01:26,730 --> 03:01:27,550
There you go.

2666
03:01:28,390 --> 03:01:29,890
We got a bug!

2667
03:01:32,610 --> 03:01:33,870
Look at him!

2668
03:01:34,310 --> 03:01:35,510
He's kind of wiggly.

2669
03:01:35,930 --> 03:01:36,030
Oh!

2670
03:01:36,710 --> 03:01:37,630
Local enough.

2671
03:01:37,770 --> 03:01:38,150
Oh, here!

2672
03:01:39,130 --> 03:01:40,330
Oh, this is cool!

2673
03:01:40,630 --> 03:01:40,810
Wait, three!

2674
03:01:40,990 --> 03:01:41,270
Oh!

2675
03:01:42,290 --> 03:01:43,490
Wait, this is cool!

2676
03:01:43,970 --> 03:01:45,430
Wait, but where's the fourth one?

2677
03:01:49,770 --> 03:01:50,890
I got...

2678
03:01:50,890 --> 03:01:52,110
Three out of four!

2679
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:52,890
Oh, here he is.

2680
03:01:53,910 --> 03:01:55,310
Oh, cool!

2681
03:02:03,110 --> 03:02:03,630
Way!

2682
03:02:04,350 --> 03:02:05,130
I like that!

2683
03:02:05,250 --> 03:02:06,110
That was fun!

2684
03:02:07,190 --> 03:02:08,490
That's a fun little addition.

2685
03:02:13,410 --> 03:02:14,610
I liked that a lot.

2686
03:02:16,770 --> 03:02:23,690
You find like the anomalies in the one localized area, multiple of them, and...

2687
03:02:24,490 --> 03:02:25,450
Yeah, I liked that.

2688
03:02:25,630 --> 03:02:27,410
MGS 2- I know how I was thinking it too.

2689
03:02:28,570 --> 03:02:30,570
I was like, oh no, the Seagulls.

2690
03:02:34,390 --> 03:02:46,930
cake what are you even saying right now you killed birds that's why you're the best big bird got

2691
03:02:56,560 --> 03:03:03,560
the biggest man you guys see him in the fog

2692
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:16,000
um intruder wait select all faces looking upwards no way i have to do a right now?

2693
03:03:21,010 --> 03:03:23,250
We got the biggest man!

2694
03:03:24,210 --> 03:03:25,570
Oh, my huge guy!

2695
03:03:25,730 --> 03:03:26,650
Hugeest guy!

2696
03:03:26,790 --> 03:03:28,030
Wait, that was so cool!

2697
03:03:30,630 --> 03:03:33,730
We'd like a Titan for real coming in.

2698
03:03:36,190 --> 03:03:38,290
Oh, I was gonna say why is there music?

2699
03:03:38,450 --> 03:03:40,130
I think it's because we're in the final hour.

2700
03:03:44,220 --> 03:03:45,020
Very cool.

2701
03:03:46,100 --> 03:03:46,800
Very cool.

2702
03:03:52,850 --> 03:03:54,190
Is it quiet?

2703
03:03:54,410 --> 03:03:55,150
Can you guys hear it?

2704
03:04:06,370 --> 03:04:08,270
There is a body in the bed?

2705
03:04:08,650 --> 03:04:10,670
No, I think that's just it ruffled up.

2706
03:04:14,640 --> 03:04:15,560
No, it's kind of hard to see.

2707
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:16,440
It's a little dark.

2708
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:19,880
Was the basket always open?

2709
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:20,820
What basket?

2710
03:04:21,820 --> 03:04:22,320
In what room?

2711
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:27,040
Hmm.

2712
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:28,120
Ah!

2713
03:04:30,900 --> 03:04:33,620
Oh, we were so close!

2714
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:39,120
Object movement and basement, missing objects and interior, object replacement and pier.

2715
03:04:40,300 --> 03:04:43,040
Oh, we were so close!

2716
03:04:43,980 --> 03:04:46,300
We were so stinking close.

2717
03:04:48,740 --> 03:04:50,020
Only three!

2718
03:04:52,980 --> 03:04:55,940
Dang it, literally in the last hour!

2719
03:04:57,760 --> 03:04:59,620
Object movement in basement.

2720
03:04:59,860 --> 03:05:02,180
Maybe it was one of the mouse traps.

2721
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:04,280
Let's try again.

2722
03:05:06,100 --> 03:05:08,080
Let's go to the...

2723
03:05:12,190 --> 03:05:12,710
No.

2724
03:05:13,510 --> 03:05:14,030
This!

2725
03:05:14,270 --> 03:05:16,130
I told you it wasn't flammable.

2726
03:05:16,330 --> 03:05:16,670
I tried.

2727
03:05:16,730 --> 03:05:17,990
I didn't know what it... Okay.

2728
03:05:18,390 --> 03:05:18,930
Okay, okay.

2729
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:20,650
Okay, okay.

2730
03:05:21,530 --> 03:05:23,670
Now we know, though, kind of...

2731
03:05:24,390 --> 03:05:26,190
How things are like here.

2732
03:05:26,270 --> 03:05:27,290
We can check...

2733
03:05:27,290 --> 03:05:29,850
And it said something in this room, too, no?

2734
03:05:29,850 --> 03:05:31,610
or the basket is open.

2735
03:05:31,910 --> 03:05:32,950
Okay, the basket is open.

2736
03:05:40,170 --> 03:05:41,870
Run it back.

2737
03:05:42,070 --> 03:05:42,630
Run it back.

2738
03:05:45,790 --> 03:05:46,410
Okay.

2739
03:05:48,030 --> 03:05:52,750
I feel like I have a pretty good handle on things now.

2740
03:05:53,590 --> 03:05:54,050
Maybe.

2741
03:05:54,850 --> 03:05:56,850
I'll still need your help, please.

2742
03:05:58,850 --> 03:06:01,230
Maybe it was an image anomaly technically.

2743
03:06:01,610 --> 03:06:03,290
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe.

2744
03:06:05,030 --> 03:06:05,970
Maybe, maybe.

2745
03:06:06,910 --> 03:06:08,110
Extra bottle on the pier.

2746
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:11,270
Was there or is it just these two here?

2747
03:06:11,790 --> 03:06:13,970
I didn't see where an extra one even was.

2748
03:06:15,910 --> 03:06:15,930
Ah.

2749
03:06:16,870 --> 03:06:18,330
Anomalies start from 15.

2750
03:06:18,530 --> 03:06:19,190
Thank you.

2751
03:06:19,270 --> 03:06:20,410
That's actually so helpful.

2752
03:06:21,330 --> 03:06:22,230
Thank you so much.

2753
03:06:23,910 --> 03:06:23,970
Okay.

2754
03:06:24,970 --> 03:06:26,850
Anomalies coming in.

2755
03:06:27,030 --> 03:06:27,910
Coming in high.

2756
03:06:28,910 --> 03:07:05,210
Anomalies coming in hot was this always open yes i think it was okay all right coming at you i guess we can also see if like um what's it called if it's scripted or not or if it's random you know if it's scripted for the demo probably not i think was that thing always hanging at the top of the lighthouse uh yes it was

2757
03:07:12,700 --> 03:07:23,420
this thing right here yeah i've been keeping my eye on it because i'm like when is it gonna change to like a dead body or something you know scary

2758
03:07:26,460 --> 03:07:29,420
if it's not randomized i don't think i'll i think i'll

2759
03:07:33,360 --> 03:07:52,300
smoke okay it's not randomized at all i was gonna say if it's not randomized or it is randomized if it's not randomized i was gonna say maybe we won't replay it and maybe we'll just play the full game when it comes out but it's definitely randomized that was that was a quick catch i think

2760
03:07:57,800 --> 03:08:10,560
cool that means we'll get some new stuff very cool very cool Something feels different here, and I don't know what.

2761
03:08:20,620 --> 03:08:21,920
What is this game?

2762
03:08:22,080 --> 03:08:24,460
It's I'm on Observation Duty 8.

2763
03:08:25,400 --> 03:08:27,480
But there's no...

2764
03:08:30,830 --> 03:08:32,950
Sorry, I thought I heard the hugest of my own.

2765
03:08:33,430 --> 03:08:37,870
There's no, like, super story for it, so you can just play it any game.

2766
03:08:39,090 --> 03:08:40,550
Was this wheelbarrow always here?

2767
03:08:41,550 --> 03:08:43,270
Maybe I never noticed it was a wheelbarrow.

2768
03:08:43,810 --> 03:08:43,810
It

2769
03:08:48,350 --> 03:08:50,750
was okay.

2770
03:08:54,930 --> 03:08:56,870
Things be changing.

2771
03:08:57,330 --> 03:08:59,450
We gotta look around.

2772
03:09:00,190 --> 03:09:01,150
We gotta find them.

2773
03:09:06,550 --> 03:09:08,810
Missing box and stairwell, top left.

2774
03:09:10,750 --> 03:09:11,270
This one?

2775
03:09:13,570 --> 03:09:14,650
Missing object?

2776
03:09:15,430 --> 03:09:15,870
Or here?

2777
03:09:16,210 --> 03:09:17,310
Or this would be top left.

2778
03:09:19,970 --> 03:09:20,490
No?

2779
03:09:27,560 --> 03:09:29,780
Basically a creepy spot the difference game.

2780
03:09:29,940 --> 03:09:30,920
Pretty fun with friends around stream.

2781
03:09:31,360 --> 03:09:32,220
Yeah, exactly.

2782
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:36,380
Intruder bottom right.

2783
03:09:37,280 --> 03:09:38,900
Why am I not finding anything?

2784
03:09:39,140 --> 03:09:39,860
Oh gosh.

2785
03:09:40,100 --> 03:09:40,800
This is pretty bad.

2786
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:42,540
I feel like we're going to get a warning soon.

2787
03:09:47,830 --> 03:09:52,830
Usually they have like two subtle anomalies and then one obvious one.

2788
03:09:54,670 --> 03:09:55,830
Ah!

2789
03:09:56,190 --> 03:09:57,030
This one.

2790
03:09:57,590 --> 03:09:57,850
Uh.

2791
03:10:00,790 --> 03:10:01,330
Extra object.

2792
03:10:01,510 --> 03:10:02,310
There we go.

2793
03:10:14,330 --> 03:10:15,010
Purple.

2794
03:10:30,550 --> 03:10:30,590
Hmm.

2795
03:10:32,590 --> 03:10:34,130
I'm an invisible man.

2796
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:35,950
Sleep it in your bed.

2797
03:10:38,430 --> 03:10:38,830
Okay.

2798
03:10:41,650 --> 03:10:43,970
One of the barrels too small in the basement.

2799
03:10:44,470 --> 03:10:46,190
I guess we'll check when we go back there.

2800
03:10:49,430 --> 03:10:50,790
I thought I heard something talking.

2801
03:10:51,450 --> 03:10:51,590
Creepy.

2802
03:10:52,790 --> 03:10:56,550
It's also the fact that this game is so quiet, you know.

2803
03:10:59,380 --> 03:11:00,680
Oh, extra object.

2804
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:01,900
I know this one.

2805
03:11:02,360 --> 03:11:03,260
I look for it now.

2806
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:05,580
Ha ha ha.

2807
03:11:13,140 --> 03:11:17,140
this one maybe I can try object replacement

2808
03:11:20,740 --> 03:12:02,520
let's see no hmm I guess it was always that so I's oh no well thank you so much for that Tony thank you thank you so so much I really appreciate it this is the series that has some dude that was pooping on the train There's like some really There's like a Some of the games got like kind of raunchy Like I think there had to be like a streamer mode to censor some stuff And then I think once the games really popped off with streamers Then he was like Okay maybe I shouldn't put this stuff in the game Like there was

2809
03:12:06,420 --> 03:12:09,260
Handprint There was

2810
03:12:15,350 --> 03:12:16,650
That's freaky.

2811
03:12:18,390 --> 03:12:20,730
Is he gonna be crawling around now here?

2812
03:12:21,290 --> 03:12:22,070
Scary.

2813
03:12:26,360 --> 03:12:27,740
Spooky scary.

2814
03:12:28,200 --> 03:12:28,580
Spooky spooky.

2815
03:12:29,480 --> 03:12:31,920
Oh my gosh, I've been such a Halloween mood now.

2816
03:12:37,560 --> 03:12:38,340
Hmm.

2817
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:41,960
Okay.

2818
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:45,600
PT from Death Stranding.

2819
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:49,700
Exactly.

2820
03:12:53,260 --> 03:12:57,940
Also feel free to shout out if you see anything or even if you think you see something.

2821
03:12:59,780 --> 03:13:00,720
We will try.

2822
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:03,440
It's a photo on the wall different.

2823
03:13:03,600 --> 03:13:06,860
In the bedroom, I don't think it was, but I can check.

2824
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:11,340
When we get back there.

2825
03:13:12,720 --> 03:13:13,580
I see a ghost.

2826
03:13:14,240 --> 03:13:14,500
Yeah!

2827
03:13:15,420 --> 03:13:15,960
This one?

2828
03:13:16,020 --> 03:13:17,520
No, this has been the same the whole time.

2829
03:13:19,100 --> 03:13:21,180
Under the bed, this has been here the whole time.

2830
03:13:21,920 --> 03:13:22,380
in there.

2831
03:13:23,980 --> 03:13:24,760
Yes, yes, indeed.

2832
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:26,540
Okay.

2833
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:31,360
I gotta start scrolling through these a little bit more quickly, just in case.

2834
03:13:32,580 --> 03:13:33,340
We get the warning.

2835
03:13:33,500 --> 03:13:38,680
I think you get the one warning, and then if you get the warning again, it's over!

2836
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:43,060
Lantern changed an interior.

2837
03:13:44,540 --> 03:13:44,940
Did it?

2838
03:13:47,860 --> 03:13:48,380
Interior.

2839
03:13:49,320 --> 03:13:49,820
This one?

2840
03:13:51,260 --> 03:14:15,480
Why is like flickering kind of you see that uh object movement did it move i think it moved i think it was here before no i'm dealing with some rough stuff but it's been nice to tune in your streams relax man i love your streams with nimmy and bb do oh lunar i hope everything's okay but thank you so much for the super chat i'm glad that i can help a little bit even thank you

2841
03:14:19,830 --> 03:14:27,310
okay Hmm.

2842
03:14:29,870 --> 03:14:30,910
Mm-hmm.

2843
03:14:34,800 --> 03:14:35,200
Uh.

2844
03:14:36,540 --> 03:14:37,040
Huh.

2845
03:14:40,500 --> 03:14:42,420
Okay, maybe we're doing all right.

2846
03:14:44,440 --> 03:14:45,780
Seconds before disaster.

2847
03:14:47,080 --> 03:14:50,220
Seconds before we get the beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, you know?

2848
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:56,930
Or the stairwell stair is always red.

2849
03:14:57,010 --> 03:14:58,870
They look like super slanted.

2850
03:14:59,190 --> 03:15:00,330
My head's kind of blocking it.

2851
03:15:00,330 --> 03:15:02,610
They look a little weird, but...

2852
03:15:02,610 --> 03:15:03,630
I believe they were.

2853
03:15:07,250 --> 03:15:07,770
Sorry.

2854
03:15:10,290 --> 03:15:11,790
Oh, it's only two?

2855
03:15:12,250 --> 03:15:12,550
Okay.

2856
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:17,990
I think there's an extra board on the shed at the pier.

2857
03:15:19,710 --> 03:15:21,390
Extra board in the shed?

2858
03:15:24,230 --> 03:15:25,410
Oh, like up here?

2859
03:15:26,330 --> 03:15:27,870
I thought there was always two.

2860
03:15:28,090 --> 03:15:29,490
Freaky anomaly in bottom left?

2861
03:15:29,630 --> 03:15:30,310
I'm watching the stream.

2862
03:15:30,330 --> 03:15:31,570
Dream in the mirror?

2863
03:15:34,610 --> 03:15:35,090
Oh!

2864
03:15:35,630 --> 03:15:37,670
We are once again in the water.

2865
03:15:38,390 --> 03:15:39,210
In the yard.

2866
03:15:45,140 --> 03:15:46,240
No, that's normal.

2867
03:15:46,740 --> 03:15:47,440
The ones on the roof?

2868
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:48,180
Yeah, I think so.

2869
03:15:48,280 --> 03:15:48,820
I think so.

2870
03:15:53,360 --> 03:15:55,520
I think the two boards on the roof are normal.

2871
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:56,340
I agree.

2872
03:16:00,390 --> 03:16:01,950
At least they've always been there.

2873
03:16:02,030 --> 03:16:03,230
They're my comfort boards.

2874
03:16:05,070 --> 03:16:05,950
Or something.

2875
03:16:06,310 --> 03:16:06,890
I don't know.

2876
03:16:07,870 --> 03:16:22,230
under the sea under the sea darling it's better downwards when I take it from me I don't want this one I don't want that guy again that scares me

2877
03:16:27,770 --> 03:16:34,590
it does look like a body hold on dead body I'm just gonna try I'm just gonna try

2878
03:16:38,030 --> 03:16:39,090
Okay, no.

2879
03:16:43,380 --> 03:16:44,620
I thought I heard a sound.

2880
03:16:47,280 --> 03:16:48,800
That's the thing, again, about this game.

2881
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:54,700
It's not like a scary game, but like the very subtle audio clues and like...

2882
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:59,620
Like just how everything is so like...

2883
03:16:59,620 --> 03:17:03,580
It can be so subtle and then you lose your...

2884
03:17:03,580 --> 03:17:07,000
You lose your guard and then things jump in your face.

2885
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:08,220
Ah, what is that?

2886
03:17:10,340 --> 03:17:18,380
Uh Seam Smoke fog No What is extra object?

2887
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:20,200
Light anomaly?

2888
03:17:22,200 --> 03:17:26,280
Yeah, it's a flare Okay, good

2889
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:38,200
Okay, cool I like that we're getting some new ones though It looks weird, doesn't it?

2890
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:38,520
it?

2891
03:17:38,660 --> 03:17:39,080
I don't know.

2892
03:17:39,180 --> 03:17:39,860
It looks different.

2893
03:17:40,020 --> 03:17:40,780
The bed.

2894
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:44,680
The bed looks different to me and I don't know why.

2895
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:46,240
Is it just me?

2896
03:17:47,700 --> 03:17:48,900
Is it just me?

2897
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:54,180
It always looked like that.

2898
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:54,620
Did it?

2899
03:17:55,940 --> 03:17:59,780
I guess I've like gaslit myself into thinking it looks different.

2900
03:18:01,660 --> 03:18:01,800
Oh!

2901
03:18:02,560 --> 03:18:02,960
Water.

2902
03:18:03,440 --> 03:18:04,540
Anomaly in the basement.

2903
03:18:06,260 --> 03:18:06,980
That's not good.

2904
03:18:07,180 --> 03:18:07,420
Oh no.

2905
03:18:07,540 --> 03:18:08,500
It's starting to flood for real.

2906
03:18:08,900 --> 03:18:09,160
Uh oh.

2907
03:18:09,400 --> 03:18:31,580
We're gonna drown okay everything's fine it's so funny how like things will be like going going crazy like oh my god and then suddenly it's like i'll fixed okay

2908
03:18:34,770 --> 03:18:46,630
it's almost three i think that's when we got our first like when it turned three before Bird?

2909
03:18:48,210 --> 03:18:49,230
I see no bird.

2910
03:18:52,170 --> 03:18:54,030
Cuteness anomaly, top right?

2911
03:18:56,410 --> 03:18:58,290
Oh my gosh.

2912
03:19:00,150 --> 03:19:06,650
Also, sometimes the anomalies can even be like changing the name, even without that freaky guy around.

2913
03:19:09,610 --> 03:19:11,630
Now, the keeper's room always been this cracked.

2914
03:19:11,770 --> 03:19:12,710
I think so.

2915
03:19:13,230 --> 03:19:14,890
I think I've definitely taken note of.

2916
03:19:14,910 --> 03:19:41,510
some of it before I don't know to this extent but I think so they had missing cameras in Oregon yeah missing cameras always freaks me out because I'm just like so focused on going to the next camera the next camera the next camera I never like perceive that one is missing or something it's yeah yeah yeah yeah that one would get me too

2917
03:19:44,910 --> 03:19:45,330
Hmm.

2918
03:19:49,150 --> 03:19:49,750
Hmm.

2919
03:19:53,690 --> 03:19:55,870
Different floor wall textures are brutal.

2920
03:19:56,330 --> 03:19:57,010
I know!

2921
03:19:59,590 --> 03:20:02,090
Usually floor is very easy to tell.

2922
03:20:02,310 --> 03:20:04,310
Oh, that's a...

2923
03:20:04,310 --> 03:20:05,110
Okay, it's a worm.

2924
03:20:05,870 --> 03:20:06,830
Oh, my God.

2925
03:20:07,530 --> 03:20:09,130
Um, is that an intruder?

2926
03:20:10,050 --> 03:20:11,430
That is a worm, right?

2927
03:20:11,990 --> 03:20:13,030
I think that's a worm.

2928
03:20:13,370 --> 03:20:14,290
That's a worm, right?

2929
03:20:21,590 --> 03:20:22,770
Uh, intruder?

2930
03:20:27,230 --> 03:20:27,750
Yes.

2931
03:20:28,330 --> 03:20:28,850
Wait.

2932
03:20:30,210 --> 03:20:30,730
Intruder.

2933
03:20:31,730 --> 03:20:32,930
It is over.

2934
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:45,760
Missing object in the pier.

2935
03:20:45,860 --> 03:20:46,420
What was missing?

2936
03:20:47,560 --> 03:20:51,280
Did he die in this game?

2937
03:21:02,830 --> 03:21:03,250
Dang.

2938
03:21:03,390 --> 03:21:04,850
We got pretty far, though.

2939
03:21:05,130 --> 03:21:05,950
It was not a worm.

2940
03:21:06,090 --> 03:21:06,510
It was a...

2941
03:21:06,510 --> 03:21:06,730
Wait.

2942
03:21:08,330 --> 03:21:09,830
So was it that guy's...

2943
03:21:11,690 --> 03:21:12,250
Finger?

2944
03:21:25,630 --> 03:21:27,870
Should we try it one more time?

2945
03:21:28,870 --> 03:21:30,110
I wonder...

2946
03:21:33,860 --> 03:21:37,040
Now I'm wondering, is it possible to be the...

2947
03:21:37,040 --> 03:21:38,780
What was missing on the pier?

2948
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:45,540
I'm looking around and everything that I see here I saw before as well.

2949
03:21:46,440 --> 03:21:48,800
Dutchie, oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gift.

2950
03:21:48,820 --> 03:21:49,300
That

2951
03:21:53,740 --> 03:21:56,040
was one big finger.

2952
03:21:56,200 --> 03:21:58,000
Well, it was also a big guy.

2953
03:21:58,320 --> 03:21:59,400
A big baby, maybe.

2954
03:22:02,940 --> 03:22:04,560
What was missing here?

2955
03:22:05,940 --> 03:22:06,980
I have no clue.

2956
03:22:09,280 --> 03:22:10,160
Baby, let me...

2957
03:22:10,160 --> 03:22:12,360
I'm going to move my head over just a tad.

2958
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:13,080
Well, I don't know.

2959
03:22:13,140 --> 03:22:13,560
It's really hard.

2960
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:15,120
Actually, you know what I'll do instead?

2961
03:22:15,540 --> 03:22:16,360
I'll shrink the game.

2962
03:22:18,320 --> 03:22:21,220
I'll shrink the game so that you guys can see better.

2963
03:22:21,460 --> 03:22:22,560
Because there's some things.

2964
03:22:23,260 --> 03:22:25,220
Like probably this here, you never even noticed.

2965
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:32,540
He became a worm for you, girl.

2966
03:22:34,820 --> 03:22:36,180
Okay, all right.

2967
03:22:36,460 --> 03:22:39,880
This time, this time, this time, this time, this time.

2968
03:22:47,520 --> 03:22:52,580
So we got hugest man, and we got his son.

2969
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:58,280
Ah, I didn't even notice the fireplace.

2970
03:22:59,460 --> 03:23:01,940
Oh, yeah, that's been there the whole time.

2971
03:23:03,780 --> 03:23:06,800
Okay, it's 15 past.

2972
03:23:08,420 --> 03:23:11,920
Anomalies will start appearing.

2973
03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:13,200
Now.

2974
03:23:13,880 --> 03:23:16,300
They will start appearing.

2975
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:17,620
Now.

2976
03:23:18,460 --> 03:23:19,180
Right now.

2977
03:23:19,780 --> 03:23:20,660
There's an anomaly.

2978
03:23:21,480 --> 03:23:21,680
Now.

2979
03:23:22,520 --> 03:23:23,720
It's right now.

2980
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:31,380
Are you winning, Mintho?

2981
03:23:33,260 --> 03:23:34,360
I'm not sure.

2982
03:23:37,640 --> 03:23:39,860
I don't know, actually.

2983
03:23:40,360 --> 03:23:41,160
I don't know.

2984
03:23:41,440 --> 03:23:42,080
I don't know.

2985
03:23:43,300 --> 03:23:44,580
I just want to beat the demo.

2986
03:23:45,140 --> 03:23:46,580
This will be the last attempt, though.

2987
03:23:48,040 --> 03:23:52,560
And if I don't beat it, maybe we'll have a revengeance when the actual game comes out.

2988
03:23:59,350 --> 03:24:56,510
we were so close on our first run I'm so ah I'm so ah well I'm glad we got to play the second time we got to see some cool new anomalies in the actual game does it go through multiple locations it does yeah in the actual game there's a lot of different locations I thought it said was to so I feel like to move is what it said i think there's going to be like an element of walking around so maybe they plan on including some more like um when you're not doing the observation part there's a little bit more lore and walking around and exploration like i think that would be really cool something kind of that the game the games i feel like at this point like you do the first couple okay like Like,

2989
03:24:57,210 --> 03:25:02,910
you aren't sure of how the success of the game is going to go and stuff like that.

2990
03:25:03,010 --> 03:25:06,510
You know, you just kind of put it out there and see if it catches.

2991
03:25:07,910 --> 03:25:11,510
But now that we're on Observation Duty 8, I would like some more lore.

2992
03:25:12,890 --> 03:25:13,750
Check the teeth?

2993
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:15,970
Eyeballs!

2994
03:25:16,970 --> 03:25:20,630
Sorry, I'm totally not even object replacement.

2995
03:25:21,950 --> 03:25:22,530
Camera malfunction.

2996
03:25:23,110 --> 03:25:23,690
Wait, where?

2997
03:25:27,990 --> 03:25:28,890
Which camera?

2998
03:25:31,730 --> 03:25:33,070
What are we missing?

2999
03:25:33,610 --> 03:25:35,250
Oh, what are we missing?

3000
03:25:38,430 --> 03:25:39,350
Crocodile alligator.

3001
03:25:39,630 --> 03:25:41,570
I drive a Chevrolet movie theater.

3002
03:25:41,750 --> 03:25:42,390
Which one are we missing?

3003
03:25:43,650 --> 03:25:44,110
Basement.

3004
03:25:46,530 --> 03:25:48,030
Okay, this is what I meant.

3005
03:25:48,270 --> 03:25:48,650
Oh my gosh.

3006
03:25:48,770 --> 03:25:49,430
No, please God.

3007
03:25:49,650 --> 03:25:50,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3008
03:26:13,610 --> 03:26:15,330
He's gonna show me his finger.

3009
03:26:22,420 --> 03:26:22,880
Um.

3010
03:26:24,920 --> 03:26:25,380
Yeah.

3011
03:26:25,960 --> 03:26:26,020
Yeah.

3012
03:26:27,320 --> 03:26:29,380
Goodness gracious, everybody.

3013
03:26:32,540 --> 03:26:33,400
Okay, what was I saying though?

3014
03:26:33,520 --> 03:26:35,060
I don't remember anymore, but that's okay.

3015
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:36,280
We're focused.

3016
03:26:36,540 --> 03:26:37,660
I was just chit-chatting.

3017
03:26:39,260 --> 03:26:42,160
I was just speaking my mind, not even paying attention.

3018
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:44,000
Barrel.

3019
03:26:44,320 --> 03:26:45,240
Barrel is down.

3020
03:26:45,360 --> 03:26:46,780
Oh, is this standing up?

3021
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:47,940
Object movement?

3022
03:26:48,820 --> 03:26:49,040
Maybe?

3023
03:26:53,050 --> 03:26:54,290
Oh, thank you guys.

3024
03:26:54,930 --> 03:26:57,610
I'm really not paying attention at all right now.

3025
03:27:00,410 --> 03:27:14,160
okay we gotta we gotta lock in good catch everybody thank you so much for the help good job good job I pat your head too pat pat pat pat pat pat

3026
03:27:24,090 --> 03:27:55,620
that's also why I like playing this game on stream though because I feel like it's a little more interactive where you guys get to kind of watch and be on the lookout as well so it feels a little more like we're playing together did the screen get smaller yeah i made it smaller so that i wasn't blocking some of it because i have a big head i think this was image anomaly

3027
03:28:03,690 --> 03:28:34,610
is that a cross at the back of the pier it is and it's been there the whole time if it becomes a normal cross without the without the floaty then we have a problem that's our anomaly i should be counting like the number of sandbags one two three four five six seven okay seven i mean i could we could be missing one who knows the camera's shrinking bro camera malfunction

3028
03:28:44,350 --> 03:29:02,530
sorry I thought something was weird with the fire okay okay wait did I say 6-7 why did I say it wait why did I say it though oh

3029
03:29:10,420 --> 03:30:17,040
because I was counting the bags you guys oh smoke Smoke Worst meme That's so stupid It's actually just so dumb That's okay Let people be dumb Hmm Uh If you just let people do whatever and you just kind of you know just you know just be like i don't care as long as you're not killing anybody then it's you live a happier life i would know i'm dead don't waste your life being upset all the time yeah it'll die out of it memes nowadays like go like crazy you know

3030
03:30:20,440 --> 03:30:47,360
extra object in the side of the pier this this has always been here but my head was blocking it before so you might just not recognize it but yeah memes go so fast nowadays you don't like the time it takes to run the joke into the ground is like a millisecond extra barrel in the yard

3031
03:30:53,310 --> 03:30:53,750
This?

3032
03:30:54,990 --> 03:30:56,030
This has always been there.

3033
03:31:11,950 --> 03:31:12,630
It's okay.

3034
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:21,200
Is this an extra box?

3035
03:31:23,160 --> 03:31:24,640
Or was it always stacked?

3036
03:31:24,980 --> 03:31:25,620
I can't remember.

3037
03:31:28,380 --> 03:31:29,120
Okay, never mind.

3038
03:31:30,280 --> 03:31:31,760
I think I just didn't realize it was...

3039
03:31:31,760 --> 03:31:34,640
I thought it was a big box and I didn't realize it was a stacked box.

3040
03:31:35,420 --> 03:31:36,060
Okay.

3041
03:31:36,840 --> 03:31:37,480
Alright.

3042
03:31:39,100 --> 03:31:39,740
Okay.

3043
03:31:40,540 --> 03:31:40,960
Alright.

3044
03:31:41,580 --> 03:31:42,320
Okay, alright.

3045
03:31:42,640 --> 03:31:44,800
But we're still seeing new stuff again.

3046
03:31:45,880 --> 03:31:46,920
That's always fun.

3047
03:31:48,340 --> 03:31:49,000
Every time.

3048
03:31:50,160 --> 03:31:52,280
Every single time.

3049
03:31:53,640 --> 03:31:54,540
The cross is gone?

3050
03:31:55,720 --> 03:31:56,380
No, it's here.

3051
03:31:59,560 --> 03:31:59,900
Wait.

3052
03:32:00,140 --> 03:32:01,020
Is it longer?

3053
03:32:01,940 --> 03:32:02,400
The pier?

3054
03:32:04,320 --> 03:32:06,080
room manipulation maybe

3055
03:32:11,620 --> 03:32:30,220
ah yeah it got further away oh good catch good catch I just saw that it was there and I didn't recognize to me that it was like pushed back whoa wait oh never mind

3056
03:32:35,740 --> 03:32:54,660
good job team I love that word team i love that we can all work together with this you know how is it only two i know the game is quite slow not gonna lie that's why this will be my last time attempting

3057
03:32:58,550 --> 03:33:07,370
hmm i want the ropes again they were funny i liked that one or the birds

3058
03:33:10,650 --> 03:33:13,510
Oh yeah, this game is like crazy slow burn.

3059
03:33:14,310 --> 03:33:16,630
It's very like...

3060
03:33:16,630 --> 03:33:19,070
I wouldn't even explain it as atmospheric.

3061
03:33:19,450 --> 03:33:22,630
It's atmospheric, but it's a slow atmosphere.

3062
03:33:25,950 --> 03:33:26,470
Like...

3063
03:33:26,470 --> 03:33:27,690
It's just...

3064
03:33:27,690 --> 03:33:28,090
Yeah.

3065
03:33:37,470 --> 03:33:38,850
Relys on tension a lot.

3066
03:33:38,990 --> 03:33:40,010
Yeah, right, right.

3067
03:33:40,830 --> 03:33:42,390
Very much so.

3068
03:33:45,410 --> 03:33:45,910
Eee!

3069
03:33:46,830 --> 03:33:47,590
Oh,

3070
03:33:51,240 --> 03:33:51,980
he's freaky.

3071
03:33:52,340 --> 03:33:53,700
Oh, he's really creepy looking.

3072
03:33:54,380 --> 03:33:54,720
Eee!

3073
03:33:55,840 --> 03:33:56,600
Oh,

3074
03:34:01,880 --> 03:34:06,760
I liked how the little, like, anomaly marker jumped up with him.

3075
03:34:07,480 --> 03:34:09,240
That was freaky!

3076
03:34:11,060 --> 03:34:12,920
That was freaky, freaky.

3077
03:34:16,320 --> 03:34:21,640
wow we're still getting so many new ones crazy

3078
03:34:27,240 --> 03:34:30,720
that one really freaked me the way he like kind of peeked up

3079
03:34:34,300 --> 03:34:48,320
especially for a demo yeah our third playthrough and like we've gotten so many new things only like a couple of repeats but Honestly, mostly new stuff.

3080
03:34:53,960 --> 03:34:55,360
Watching on my phone, couldn't see the guy.

3081
03:34:55,620 --> 03:34:55,900
Oh, no!

3082
03:34:56,040 --> 03:34:56,380
You know what?

3083
03:34:56,400 --> 03:34:57,340
Maybe it's for the best.

3084
03:34:57,480 --> 03:34:58,660
He was kind of...

3085
03:34:59,420 --> 03:35:01,260
He was pretty scary.

3086
03:35:09,200 --> 03:35:12,820
I was like, the ropes coming down reminded me of something.

3087
03:35:14,120 --> 03:35:16,460
Of course, it reminded me of half-life.

3088
03:35:19,300 --> 03:35:21,280
Yeah, of course, of course.

3089
03:35:21,820 --> 03:35:22,280
Go back?

3090
03:35:23,240 --> 03:35:24,500
To this one?

3091
03:35:31,940 --> 03:35:33,440
Missing trap in the basement?

3092
03:35:33,680 --> 03:35:33,920
Let's see.

3093
03:35:34,040 --> 03:35:35,240
We have one, two, three, four.

3094
03:35:35,380 --> 03:35:35,520
Nope.

3095
03:35:35,760 --> 03:35:36,800
All still there.

3096
03:35:39,220 --> 03:35:40,180
Nice to check though.

3097
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:48,120
The trauma.

3098
03:35:48,340 --> 03:35:50,220
Yeah, the trauma of the ropes.

3099
03:35:51,780 --> 03:35:53,340
What are those guys called?

3100
03:35:54,820 --> 03:35:55,780
In the...

3101
03:35:59,440 --> 03:36:00,400
In the...

3102
03:36:00,400 --> 03:36:01,400
In the game.

3103
03:36:02,120 --> 03:36:02,600
Barnacles.

3104
03:36:11,130 --> 03:36:15,760
No, no, no, no, no!

3105
03:36:15,880 --> 03:36:16,540
Uh-oh, guys.

3106
03:36:17,100 --> 03:36:19,080
Uh-oh, do you notice anything?

3107
03:36:19,600 --> 03:36:21,760
Oh, I noticed something.

3108
03:36:26,060 --> 03:36:27,200
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

3109
03:36:32,030 --> 03:36:33,890
The water, the water.

3110
03:36:36,830 --> 03:36:38,090
I don't know.

3111
03:36:38,270 --> 03:36:39,090
I can't tell.

3112
03:36:48,890 --> 03:37:02,190
I don't think any of the mouse traps moved I don't know Gotta be missing her extra objects Yeah, those are the toughest ones for real

3113
03:37:06,160 --> 03:37:08,180
I don't know though

3114
03:37:12,940 --> 03:37:15,960
Map interior This one?

3115
03:37:16,340 --> 03:37:20,700
No, I think it's still the same Frosted window?

3116
03:37:20,960 --> 03:37:24,000
I saw that, and I wondered if they were supposed to be.

3117
03:37:25,140 --> 03:37:26,220
They're not!

3118
03:37:26,380 --> 03:37:27,380
The frosted glass!

3119
03:37:29,480 --> 03:37:32,000
I saw that earlier, too!

3120
03:37:34,340 --> 03:37:35,320
Oh, wow.

3121
03:37:35,480 --> 03:37:36,160
That's subtle.

3122
03:37:37,200 --> 03:37:38,700
That's really subtle.

3123
03:37:39,920 --> 03:37:41,300
Oh, my gosh.

3124
03:37:41,720 --> 03:37:46,940
Because it's like, I knew they weren't seethrew, but I didn't think they looked the same.

3125
03:37:48,140 --> 03:37:49,700
You think the map did change?

3126
03:37:49,720 --> 03:37:52,740
I'll try Image Anomaly.

3127
03:37:54,820 --> 03:37:56,080
The map is different.

3128
03:37:58,340 --> 03:37:59,340
What's different?

3129
03:38:00,520 --> 03:38:01,880
Oh, there was an extra!

3130
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:04,000
An extra continent!

3131
03:38:06,580 --> 03:38:09,720
Oh, I just thought it was there for...

3132
03:38:10,320 --> 03:38:11,980
I don't know, so it's like...

3133
03:38:11,980 --> 03:38:13,340
This takes place in a...

3134
03:38:13,340 --> 03:38:14,220
Oh, here we go.

3135
03:38:14,380 --> 03:38:14,720
This again.

3136
03:38:15,540 --> 03:38:17,480
This takes place in a...

3137
03:38:20,160 --> 03:38:21,940
I'm going to try object movement.

3138
03:38:22,840 --> 03:38:26,020
Different, not America, sorry, different timeline of the world.

3139
03:38:26,720 --> 03:38:29,120
Okay, so that's object movement for some reason.

3140
03:38:30,300 --> 03:38:31,740
Oh, maybe it was turned around.

3141
03:38:31,880 --> 03:38:32,880
That's why it was movement.

3142
03:38:34,520 --> 03:38:35,020
Okay, okay.

3143
03:38:36,180 --> 03:38:37,240
Yeah, it rotated.

3144
03:38:38,040 --> 03:38:38,480
Yes,

3145
03:38:41,780 --> 03:38:42,480
yes, yes.

3146
03:38:43,100 --> 03:38:45,040
Yes, yes, yes.

3147
03:38:46,880 --> 03:38:48,420
Okay, so we've taken out a couple.

3148
03:38:49,300 --> 03:38:49,940
All right, all right.

3149
03:38:49,960 --> 03:38:50,460
Good, good, good.

3150
03:38:51,280 --> 03:38:52,480
team good job team

3151
03:39:00,510 --> 03:39:06,430
but if we get another warning it won't be another warning it will just be it'll be our last

3152
03:39:18,380 --> 03:39:23,480
sparkles in the stairwell I think that's this also this room also has it I think it's just

3153
03:39:33,100 --> 03:39:42,860
come on Vita we're at the time of the impsy haunted house we trade you for this Oh, I spy.

3154
03:39:43,240 --> 03:39:45,000
I was like, if, if, I spy.

3155
03:39:47,600 --> 03:39:49,620
The I spy haunted house.

3156
03:39:50,840 --> 03:39:51,320
Holy.

3157
03:39:52,940 --> 03:39:54,160
Did we just skip the pier?

3158
03:39:55,620 --> 03:39:56,720
We'll see in a second.

3159
03:39:57,580 --> 03:39:58,180
I suppose.

3160
03:39:59,980 --> 03:40:01,820
I wish we would get more of...

3161
03:40:01,820 --> 03:40:02,880
Nope, here's the pier.

3162
03:40:03,240 --> 03:40:06,380
I wish we would get more of ones that I've gotten before already, no.

3163
03:40:08,140 --> 03:40:09,800
Gosh, that guy was so scary.

3164
03:40:10,420 --> 03:40:10,980
Wait a second.

3165
03:40:12,000 --> 03:40:13,320
Is it getting brighter?

3166
03:40:24,500 --> 03:40:24,980
Oh.

3167
03:40:25,180 --> 03:40:26,520
Oh, that's normal, I suppose.

3168
03:40:26,940 --> 03:40:28,300
Oh, I guess it's like this...

3169
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:31,420
When the big light rotates.

3170
03:40:31,860 --> 03:40:32,540
Okay, okay.

3171
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:34,460
It's the light from the lighthouse.

3172
03:40:36,180 --> 03:40:36,960
Still good to check.

3173
03:40:37,640 --> 03:40:39,040
Still okay to check.

3174
03:40:40,120 --> 03:40:40,440
Yeah.

3175
03:40:44,340 --> 03:40:46,200
That is a neat detail, yeah.

3176
03:40:47,440 --> 03:40:48,300
I don't know.

3177
03:40:48,380 --> 03:40:49,520
I really like the...

3178
03:40:50,300 --> 03:40:52,660
the way this game looks.

3179
03:40:53,560 --> 03:40:55,600
Why do these, do these look different?

3180
03:40:57,700 --> 03:40:58,860
Object replacement?

3181
03:41:00,780 --> 03:41:01,760
Missing railing?

3182
03:41:02,060 --> 03:41:02,980
Thank you guys!

3183
03:41:04,060 --> 03:41:04,260
Nope.

3184
03:41:05,240 --> 03:41:05,980
Thank you, thank you.

3185
03:41:07,420 --> 03:41:10,720
I've been looking at that one every time and the one time I don't look.

3186
03:41:14,960 --> 03:41:16,020
Movement maybe?

3187
03:41:17,400 --> 03:41:17,720
These?

3188
03:41:18,020 --> 03:41:18,620
Let me try.

3189
03:41:19,540 --> 03:41:20,300
Object movement?

3190
03:41:22,240 --> 03:41:23,580
They look different, though, no?

3191
03:41:25,420 --> 03:41:26,560
Well, guess not.

3192
03:41:27,780 --> 03:41:29,600
I think I'm gaslighting myself.

3193
03:41:29,940 --> 03:41:34,540
You really start to get to that point of the game where you're just like, this, this was, I like this!

3194
03:41:34,940 --> 03:41:37,940
And it was the whole time, literally, from the very beginning.

3195
03:41:39,980 --> 03:41:41,240
You're like, there's no way!

3196
03:41:41,340 --> 03:41:42,180
There's no way!

3197
03:41:45,580 --> 03:41:47,600
Oh, I clicked replacement again.

3198
03:41:50,320 --> 03:41:51,800
I thought I did movement.

3199
03:41:56,850 --> 03:41:59,530
Was the yellow thing on the pier on the...

3200
03:42:00,650 --> 03:42:00,710
Right.

3201
03:42:01,490 --> 03:42:03,790
Wait, we are missing something, right?

3202
03:42:04,530 --> 03:42:05,710
What am...

3203
03:42:05,710 --> 03:42:07,950
Object movement?

3204
03:42:09,490 --> 03:42:10,210
Or missing?

3205
03:42:15,950 --> 03:42:16,870
Object.

3206
03:42:18,210 --> 03:42:18,730
Missing object.

3207
03:42:18,890 --> 03:42:20,250
There we go.

3208
03:42:26,220 --> 03:42:26,520
Replacement.

3209
03:42:30,480 --> 03:42:31,080
Extra?

3210
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:34,260
Extra object.

3211
03:42:35,100 --> 03:42:35,780
Extra, extra.

3212
03:42:39,500 --> 03:42:41,620
I was going to say, it's definitely different.

3213
03:42:42,960 --> 03:42:43,640
Okay, okay, okay.

3214
03:42:45,540 --> 03:42:46,240
Thank you, guys.

3215
03:42:46,340 --> 03:42:46,840
Good catch.

3216
03:42:47,020 --> 03:42:47,740
Good catch.

3217
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:49,040
Oh.

3218
03:42:50,380 --> 03:42:51,040
All right.

3219
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:55,120
There's probably some new ones that appeared while I was fighting with that.

3220
03:42:55,640 --> 03:42:57,580
So keep your eyes peeled.

3221
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:02,980
Keep your eyes peeled.

3222
03:43:03,640 --> 03:43:05,860
Unless it's a really obvious thing.

3223
03:43:15,740 --> 03:43:21,540
I wish I could live in a creepy lighthouse, really?

3224
03:43:23,460 --> 03:43:23,840
Ah!

3225
03:43:25,020 --> 03:43:25,820
Extra object.

3226
03:43:27,280 --> 03:43:28,180
Oh, that one's kind of nice.

3227
03:43:28,320 --> 03:43:32,740
They give you, like, a little visual, like, clue because it's sparkling a little bit more.

3228
03:43:35,480 --> 03:43:36,500
That one's nice.

3229
03:43:39,540 --> 03:43:41,580
The game isn't always so cruel.

3230
03:43:45,280 --> 03:43:45,920
Okay.

3231
03:43:47,440 --> 03:43:48,260
Let's see.

3232
03:43:50,280 --> 03:43:56,240
I bet that baby from before is probably, like, you get an achievement if you die by it, you know?

3233
03:43:57,160 --> 03:43:59,040
Die by the giant baby.

3234
03:44:34,330 --> 03:44:36,550
Oh my god!

3235
03:44:37,470 --> 03:44:39,330
That one gave me chills!

3236
03:44:40,230 --> 03:44:41,770
Wait, I have to sleep tonight!

3237
03:44:42,050 --> 03:44:42,650
Maybe...

3238
03:44:42,650 --> 03:44:45,870
Oh, we have some abyss in the pier.

3239
03:44:46,010 --> 03:44:48,510
Maybe I shouldn't have closed with this game!

3240
03:44:49,450 --> 03:44:51,290
This is so scary!

3241
03:44:54,350 --> 03:44:56,210
Oh my gosh!

3242
03:44:59,450 --> 03:45:01,530
I can't believe we're still...

3243
03:45:01,530 --> 03:45:05,930
I guess probably I imagine this level is complete.

3244
03:45:06,810 --> 03:45:07,990
Or something.

3245
03:45:08,230 --> 03:45:09,390
Because there's so many.

3246
03:45:10,550 --> 03:45:13,330
There's so many new anomalies that we've gotten.

3247
03:45:14,970 --> 03:45:15,830
Oh, scary!

3248
03:45:16,330 --> 03:45:17,310
So scary.

3249
03:45:19,750 --> 03:45:21,470
It's almost 5, though.

3250
03:45:24,830 --> 03:45:26,310
Just go fishing again.

3251
03:45:26,470 --> 03:45:26,810
Yeah.

3252
03:45:30,410 --> 03:45:31,530
Holy moly.

3253
03:45:39,420 --> 03:45:40,980
Windows or Fry's did extra body.

3254
03:45:41,360 --> 03:45:41,740
Demon woman.

3255
03:45:44,200 --> 03:45:46,240
I had a feeling once we...

3256
03:45:46,240 --> 03:45:47,440
Once we...

3257
03:45:47,440 --> 03:45:50,060
I thought she would move before...

3258
03:45:50,060 --> 03:45:50,400
Like, what?

3259
03:45:51,160 --> 03:45:58,060
Like, when I was reporting it, but I didn't think that afterwards she was going to...

3260
03:45:58,060 --> 03:45:59,640
Oh, we have another hole.

3261
03:46:00,140 --> 03:46:06,150
I feel like they bumped up the scariness.

3262
03:46:06,290 --> 03:46:08,250
I feel like that too!

3263
03:46:10,110 --> 03:46:10,270
Oh.

3264
03:46:12,250 --> 03:46:12,910
Jeez.

3265
03:46:16,600 --> 03:46:19,380
Was the mirror on the dresser in interior?

3266
03:46:20,500 --> 03:46:21,400
We shall see.

3267
03:46:23,240 --> 03:46:24,460
In interior.

3268
03:46:27,760 --> 03:46:29,640
Mirror on the dresser.

3269
03:46:31,360 --> 03:46:32,500
Was there one?

3270
03:46:32,580 --> 03:46:33,380
I don't think so.

3271
03:46:34,840 --> 03:46:37,280
The bottles on the pier seem to have moved.

3272
03:46:39,240 --> 03:46:39,580
Have they?

3273
03:46:40,300 --> 03:46:41,300
I'll try.

3274
03:46:45,870 --> 03:46:46,630
There was one.

3275
03:46:47,730 --> 03:46:47,850
Oh.

3276
03:46:50,670 --> 03:46:52,230
There was one here?

3277
03:46:52,670 --> 03:46:53,670
Wait, where at?

3278
03:46:59,840 --> 03:47:02,040
Extra rail on the wall and interior.

3279
03:47:04,680 --> 03:47:05,600
Um, I don't know.

3280
03:47:05,680 --> 03:47:06,840
These have always been here.

3281
03:47:08,820 --> 03:47:10,320
Oh, this is a mirror!

3282
03:47:10,820 --> 03:47:10,840
Oh!

3283
03:47:11,120 --> 03:47:11,780
Wait, it is?

3284
03:47:14,040 --> 03:47:14,600
If it is...

3285
03:47:14,600 --> 03:47:17,140
Well, you can't just keep sitting on the same screen for so long, though.

3286
03:47:19,740 --> 03:47:21,140
If it is, I think I'm silly.

3287
03:47:21,700 --> 03:47:22,260
Can't tell.

3288
03:47:24,580 --> 03:47:25,260
Or a window.

3289
03:47:25,420 --> 03:47:26,820
Yeah, I've noticed that.

3290
03:47:26,940 --> 03:47:27,600
I didn't...

3291
03:47:27,600 --> 03:47:27,940
Yeah.

3292
03:47:30,960 --> 03:47:31,400
Okay.

3293
03:47:32,500 --> 03:47:33,380
Oh, no.

3294
03:47:35,160 --> 03:47:37,380
Oh, we might get that spooky guy again, too.

3295
03:47:38,160 --> 03:47:40,340
Hey, I don't like him.

3296
03:47:40,420 --> 03:47:41,620
I don't like him.

3297
03:47:42,940 --> 03:47:44,500
The drawer in the bedroom.

3298
03:47:47,420 --> 03:47:48,360
What about it?

3299
03:47:58,190 --> 03:47:59,770
I guess we didn't get anxiety, guy.

3300
03:48:00,810 --> 03:48:02,110
I guess that was unrelated.

3301
03:48:09,550 --> 03:48:11,250
In the last hour, there is music.

3302
03:48:12,110 --> 03:48:13,430
There are, I guess, ambiance.

3303
03:48:15,110 --> 03:48:15,450
Yeah.

3304
03:48:17,630 --> 03:48:19,150
Missing interior map.

3305
03:48:20,410 --> 03:48:20,670
No?

3306
03:48:21,210 --> 03:48:21,610
still there?

3307
03:48:25,800 --> 03:48:26,160
Puddle it?

3308
03:48:26,460 --> 03:48:26,720
This?

3309
03:48:26,820 --> 03:48:27,340
Is this new?

3310
03:48:29,780 --> 03:48:32,800
Uh, extra... Or maybe... Water?

3311
03:48:34,060 --> 03:48:34,300
No.

3312
03:48:37,750 --> 03:48:38,370
Extra object?

3313
03:48:43,790 --> 03:48:44,310
No.

3314
03:48:46,410 --> 03:48:47,810
I'm not sure, guys.

3315
03:48:48,010 --> 03:48:48,630
I'm not sure.

3316
03:48:53,230 --> 03:48:54,730
The puddle was always there.

3317
03:48:54,870 --> 03:48:57,610
Okay, I thought so, but some people were... Ah!

3318
03:48:57,710 --> 03:48:58,590
We're missing a camera!

3319
03:48:58,870 --> 03:48:59,250
Camera malfunction!

3320
03:48:59,750 --> 03:49:00,270
Uh, the pier!

3321
03:49:09,710 --> 03:49:10,070
Okay.

3322
03:49:11,110 --> 03:49:12,250
Alright, she's back.

3323
03:49:16,220 --> 03:49:17,180
Let's hope...

3324
03:49:17,180 --> 03:49:19,920
Let's pray for some really obvious ones.

3325
03:49:22,040 --> 03:49:22,680
Uh...

3326
03:49:23,480 --> 03:49:24,920
In front of map?

3327
03:49:25,020 --> 03:49:25,820
There's something missing?

3328
03:49:26,440 --> 03:49:26,740
This?

3329
03:49:29,560 --> 03:49:30,420
Let's see?

3330
03:49:34,310 --> 03:49:35,610
Ah, thank you!

3331
03:49:37,710 --> 03:49:40,210
Okay, I And I thought it looked a little naked.

3332
03:49:43,010 --> 03:49:43,650
Okay.

3333
03:49:44,850 --> 03:49:45,910
Oh, the Seagulls!

3334
03:49:52,330 --> 03:49:54,090
And Big Bird!

3335
03:49:55,590 --> 03:49:56,350
Here we go.

3336
03:49:58,510 --> 03:49:59,890
I like that one.

3337
03:50:00,090 --> 03:50:00,390
It's funny.

3338
03:50:04,390 --> 03:50:05,750
I like that one.

3339
03:50:05,810 --> 03:50:06,410
It's cute.

3340
03:50:08,710 --> 03:50:09,350
Okay.

3341
03:50:10,190 --> 03:50:11,190
All right.

3342
03:50:12,890 --> 03:50:13,490
Good job, team.

3343
03:50:13,710 --> 03:50:14,310
Good job, team.

3344
03:50:14,510 --> 03:50:15,370
Good job, team.

3345
03:50:18,610 --> 03:50:19,230
Hmm.

3346
03:50:22,940 --> 03:50:26,280
We didn't get so much in this room, actually.

3347
03:50:28,400 --> 03:50:28,660
Ah.

3348
03:50:31,320 --> 03:50:31,880
Ah.

3349
03:50:34,500 --> 03:50:35,120
Okay.

3350
03:50:37,280 --> 03:50:38,740
Lock in, everybody.

3351
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:39,760
Yeah, lock in.

3352
03:50:40,740 --> 03:50:41,440
Stare well.

3353
03:50:42,080 --> 03:50:43,120
Wait, the ropes?

3354
03:50:44,660 --> 03:50:44,940
What about?

3355
03:50:48,220 --> 03:50:49,560
Ah, thank you!

3356
03:50:55,500 --> 03:50:57,390
Okay, good job, guys, good job, good job.

3357
03:50:58,560 --> 03:50:59,390
Good job, good job.

3358
03:51:04,740 --> 03:51:06,360
I'm barking like a dog.

3359
03:51:08,600 --> 03:51:09,880
We're so close.

3360
03:51:09,960 --> 03:51:11,000
We're so close.

3361
03:51:14,180 --> 03:51:15,460
We're so close.

3362
03:51:26,180 --> 03:51:28,680
Our shift is almost over!

3363
03:51:31,140 --> 03:51:32,160
Four more minutes!

3364
03:51:33,600 --> 03:51:34,140
Please!

3365
03:51:37,420 --> 03:51:40,040
Oil missing in the lighthouse left of pillar.

3366
03:51:41,120 --> 03:51:41,300
Wait?

3367
03:51:42,880 --> 03:51:43,840
I think that's the countdown.

3368
03:51:46,260 --> 03:51:47,200
Red can at lantern.

3369
03:51:48,740 --> 03:51:48,980
Where?

3370
03:51:52,120 --> 03:51:54,040
It's okay, we made it anyway!

3371
03:51:57,260 --> 03:51:57,900
Holy

3372
03:52:01,960 --> 03:52:03,120
is crazy!

3373
03:52:04,440 --> 03:52:04,880
Yippee!

3374
03:52:09,180 --> 03:52:09,760
Yeah!

3375
03:52:10,800 --> 03:52:15,600
Oh good, we were able to complete all of the games.

3376
03:52:17,680 --> 03:52:18,600
I'm so happy.

3377
03:52:21,080 --> 03:52:22,700
This one I feel like they upped it.

3378
03:52:22,840 --> 03:52:24,340
24 is a lot.

3379
03:52:26,740 --> 03:52:29,440
I feel like this game you can...

3380
03:52:30,300 --> 03:52:31,220
What's the word?

3381
03:52:32,960 --> 03:52:37,680
You can kind of get away with only having just a few or something, you know what I mean?

3382
03:52:38,220 --> 03:52:43,780
So, yeah, that was a great demo, I feel, of the new one.

3383
03:52:44,580 --> 03:52:45,500
Hold on, one second.

3384
03:52:46,540 --> 03:52:47,900
One second, one second.

3385
03:52:48,940 --> 03:52:50,700
Let's put on some comfy music.

3386
03:52:53,460 --> 03:52:53,980
.

3387
03:52:55,900 --> 03:52:56,420
.

3388
03:52:58,750 --> 03:52:59,270
Comfy.

3389
03:53:00,290 --> 03:53:00,650
Comfy.

3390
03:53:04,170 --> 03:53:05,310
Good job, team.

3391
03:53:05,850 --> 03:53:08,410
Well, I hope you guys like that little dose of spookiness.

3392
03:53:08,650 --> 03:53:16,690
We got a good variety, I feel, of like goofy to silly to actual spooky.

3393
03:53:18,490 --> 03:53:21,470
I feel like it was a good mix.

3394
03:53:21,730 --> 03:53:22,330
It was fun?

3395
03:53:22,550 --> 03:53:22,830
Yeah.

3396
03:53:22,870 --> 03:53:23,990
You're awesome.

3397
03:53:24,810 --> 03:53:26,070
Thank you, Tri-Princess.

3398
03:53:26,930 --> 03:53:28,070
Mr. Jingles, thank you.

3399
03:53:28,190 --> 03:53:29,310
Thanks for putting up with our backseat.

3400
03:53:29,430 --> 03:53:31,790
No, no, this is the game to backseat, for real.

3401
03:53:32,150 --> 03:53:34,470
I love Observation Duty and So Cool to play with Minky and Chat.

3402
03:53:34,890 --> 03:53:35,790
Yeah, thank you.

3403
03:53:36,190 --> 03:53:36,870
Thank you.

3404
03:53:37,330 --> 03:53:41,070
Yeah, the Dead Lady and the Anxiety guy and the guy climbing.

3405
03:53:41,250 --> 03:53:41,690
Oh, my gosh.

3406
03:53:41,890 --> 03:53:42,810
There were so many things.

3407
03:53:42,950 --> 03:53:43,510
It was so freaky.

3408
03:53:45,390 --> 03:53:45,790
Maybe.

3409
03:53:47,810 --> 03:53:48,210
Since...

3410
03:53:48,830 --> 03:53:49,230
Since...

3411
03:53:50,910 --> 03:53:51,630
What's it called?

3412
03:53:52,050 --> 03:53:52,450
Oh, sorry.

3413
03:53:52,590 --> 03:53:53,810
That's the trailer for one of the games.

3414
03:53:53,910 --> 03:53:57,630
Since Next Fest is still happening until the 20th.

3415
03:53:58,190 --> 03:54:08,670
Maybe I'll pick up a couple more spooky games and that stop stop stop and then maybe we can do another like Red like horror game special.

3416
03:54:09,150 --> 03:54:09,850
It was really fun.

3417
03:54:09,870 --> 03:54:15,210
I'll be a stream the chillest fishing game when it comes out Yeah, I want to I want to thanks for the fun spooky stream.

3419
03:54:51,950 --> 03:54:54,070
Takizo, thank you so much for the podcast, thank you!

3420
03:54:54,550 --> 03:54:54,790
Thank you!

3421
03:54:54,930 --> 03:54:55,230
Thank you!

3422
03:54:58,910 --> 03:54:59,870
So, um...

3423
03:54:59,870 --> 03:55:03,510
Yeah, just trying to figure out something to do for Thursday.

3424
03:55:03,950 --> 03:55:09,090
Trying to wonder, I'm trying to decide if I should like, do a...

3425
03:55:09,710 --> 03:55:11,150
Like, start a new series.

3426
03:55:11,350 --> 03:55:12,830
I was thinking maybe Alan Wake.

3427
03:55:13,650 --> 03:55:15,830
I almost put... I almost did that today, actually.

3428
03:55:16,710 --> 03:55:17,490
Any stream tomorrow?

3429
03:55:17,590 --> 03:55:19,450
Yes, I have a collab tomorrow.

3430
03:55:21,090 --> 03:55:21,410
Mimi!

3431
03:55:21,690 --> 03:55:26,290
Mimi rated us earlier, and Camilla, so we're playing Peek.

3432
03:55:28,230 --> 03:55:30,310
Is the first Alan Wake scary?

3433
03:55:32,110 --> 03:55:35,810
Because I need to start adding some more games that, like, I can beat.

3434
03:55:36,150 --> 03:55:39,010
So I can add to my... I still need... Let's see, hold on.

3435
03:55:40,450 --> 03:55:42,970
How many more games do I need?

3436
03:55:51,820 --> 03:55:52,340
20?

3437
03:55:53,320 --> 03:55:57,340
20 more games that I need to beat before the end of the year.

3438
03:55:59,360 --> 03:56:01,240
Alan Wake is tense, not scary.

3439
03:56:01,580 --> 03:56:02,960
It can get creepy, but not scary.

3440
03:56:07,940 --> 03:56:10,420
Alan Wake 2, I've heard, is pretty spooky, though.

3441
03:56:11,300 --> 03:56:13,120
It's spooky, but not your usual scary game.

3442
03:56:13,160 --> 03:56:15,360
But I've always wanted to try it, so...

3443
03:56:17,480 --> 03:56:18,800
Do the demos count?

3444
03:56:18,900 --> 03:56:19,720
They don't.

3445
03:56:19,820 --> 03:56:20,780
They don't.

3446
03:56:20,920 --> 03:56:22,680
This BGM brings happy thoughts.

3447
03:56:23,120 --> 03:56:26,980
Yeah, it's called Lemon Cake, and it makes me always feel so...

3448
03:56:30,600 --> 03:56:33,900
You would like Urban Myth Disillusion Center.

3449
03:56:34,460 --> 03:56:36,360
Isn't that a visual novel?

3450
03:56:38,680 --> 03:56:41,620
Urban Myth Disillusion Center.

3451
03:56:42,680 --> 03:56:44,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3452
03:56:46,360 --> 03:56:47,120
It is.

3453
03:56:51,200 --> 03:56:52,240
Is it law?

3454
03:56:53,260 --> 03:56:57,770
If you wanted to complete a game quickly, it would...

3455
03:56:57,770 --> 03:56:59,070
Ah, stop, stop!

3456
03:56:59,330 --> 03:57:00,090
Oh my gosh.

3457
03:57:00,190 --> 03:57:00,550
Sorry.

3458
03:57:00,830 --> 03:57:01,510
That was so loud.

3459
03:57:03,150 --> 03:57:04,350
Go away!

3460
03:57:06,250 --> 03:57:06,850
Uh...

3461
03:57:06,850 --> 03:57:07,710
Wait, what?

3462
03:57:08,590 --> 03:57:11,590
Wisp made a game recently where you are on trial for murder.

3463
03:57:12,210 --> 03:57:13,670
The sloppy turnabouts!

3464
03:57:13,970 --> 03:57:14,250
What?

3465
03:57:16,910 --> 03:57:17,510
What?

3466
03:57:20,350 --> 03:57:20,750
Why?

3467
03:57:38,090 --> 03:57:38,690
Why?

3468
03:57:42,690 --> 03:57:53,330
My birthday was on the 5th and I never got an opportunity to pop in and say hi blade happy birthday to you too page happy birthday happy birthday

3471
03:58:21,920 --> 03:58:22,120
Yes.

3472
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:26,280
But for now, thank you guys for...

3473
03:58:27,620 --> 03:58:30,720
Um, what happens when you don't finish enough games for the year?

3474
03:58:30,800 --> 03:58:31,460
Is there a punishment?

3475
03:58:31,920 --> 03:58:33,780
That I will finish enough games.

3476
03:58:34,240 --> 03:58:35,380
I will, I will!

3477
03:58:37,660 --> 03:58:39,260
Blackout Club for Kalam.

3478
03:58:40,020 --> 03:58:40,480
What's that?

3479
03:58:46,060 --> 03:58:47,500
Oh, it's expensive!

3480
03:58:51,720 --> 03:58:52,600
Oh, wait!

3481
03:58:56,200 --> 03:58:58,980
I think I've seen this game before.

3482
03:58:59,420 --> 03:59:00,940
Oh, I have seen this game before.

3483
03:59:01,680 --> 03:59:02,880
Why is it $30?

3484
03:59:07,440 --> 03:59:08,800
Why is it $30?

3485
03:59:10,520 --> 03:59:10,920
Anyway.

3486
03:59:13,400 --> 03:59:14,580
Thank you, guys.

3487
03:59:14,660 --> 03:59:19,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you for today, for letting me try out some of these little funny demos.

3488
03:59:19,800 --> 03:59:22,120
And it was good.

3489
03:59:22,340 --> 03:59:22,760
It was good.

3490
03:59:22,900 --> 03:59:23,300
Oh, yeah.

3491
03:59:23,360 --> 03:59:24,100
Deadly Premonition.

3492
03:59:24,200 --> 03:59:25,340
I also have them on my list.

3493
03:59:25,360 --> 03:59:28,860
And I was also thinking of playing that one this week, starting it.

3494
03:59:29,160 --> 03:59:30,660
So maybe something, we'll see.

3495
03:59:31,620 --> 03:59:33,740
But I thought it was maybe too close to Silent Who.

3496
03:59:35,720 --> 03:59:36,900
So, thanks for the stream.

3497
03:59:36,980 --> 03:59:38,000
It was fun checking out all these games.

3498
03:59:38,460 --> 03:59:38,920
Thanks, Vikni.

3499
03:59:39,260 --> 03:59:39,960
Thank you, guys.

3500
03:59:40,220 --> 03:59:40,600
Thank you, guys.

3501
03:59:40,820 --> 03:59:41,760
Choo, choo.

3502
03:59:42,240 --> 03:59:43,020
Thanks for the stream.

3503
03:59:43,280 --> 03:59:43,940
Thank you, Silent Zero.

3504
03:59:44,300 --> 03:59:44,920
Thank you.

3505
03:59:46,560 --> 03:59:47,960
Also, Pirate, I'm so sorry.

3506
03:59:48,120 --> 03:59:48,620
I missed yours.

3507
03:59:48,740 --> 03:59:51,840
When it releases, you can play this one with someone who is famously good with horror.

3508
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:54,020
Which one?

3509
03:59:55,820 --> 03:59:56,700
Which game?

3510
03:59:58,800 --> 03:59:59,500
I had fun with the stream.

3511
03:59:59,740 --> 03:59:59,980
Thank you.

3512
04:00:00,420 --> 04:00:01,300
Thank you.

3513
04:00:01,740 --> 04:00:03,560
Wait, Deadly Permission is nothing like Silent Hill?

3514
04:00:03,720 --> 04:00:04,240
Oh, it's not.

3515
04:00:05,000 --> 04:00:07,480
I thought the combat was kind of similar.

3516
04:00:11,320 --> 04:00:11,880
I guess not.

3517
04:00:12,280 --> 04:00:14,580
I have, honestly, know so little about it.

3518
04:00:14,660 --> 04:00:16,160
I've tried to avoid every spoiler.

3519
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:18,640
So.

3520
04:00:25,400 --> 04:00:26,560
It's like Twin Peaks.

3521
04:00:30,620 --> 04:00:33,200
I meant the, sorry, I meant like the fighting aspect.

3522
04:00:34,220 --> 04:00:36,060
Try to control the same people of Alan Wake.

3523
04:00:36,500 --> 04:00:38,900
Well, I don't know quite yet what I'm gonna do.

3524
04:00:39,240 --> 04:00:39,980
I'll figure it out.

3525
04:00:40,080 --> 04:00:42,000

04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:48,920

I forgot to mention Um, I was given some Hold on, let me double check what they are I was given some Promotional codes?

3537
04:02:22,290 --> 04:02:31,970
Promotional codes for US Idol Festival That will be happening at the end of the month that I will be appearing at with a two meet and greets and a concert.

3538
04:02:34,710 --> 04:02:48,330
The promotional codes, I will probably do like a little raffle where you comment on Twitter or something and I maybe I'll do one on YouTube, one on, I don't know how many codes they give me.

3539
04:02:48,970 --> 04:02:54,010
But if I have multiple codes, I will do one on YouTube, like a community post and one on Twitter.

3540
04:02:54,770 --> 04:03:16,390
So just kind of keep an eye out for it but i'll do them later not tonight i'll mention again tomorrow or on another stream as well so yeah so if you don't have twitter you can comment on youtube and if you have both you can comment on both but you know yeah okay that's all i want to say
