1
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,350
Welcome back, master and mistress!

2
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,510
I kept you waiting.

3
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,250
Hello!

4
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,780
Welcome to the final installment of Peace Walker.

5
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,440
I love this game.

6
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,140
I'm sad.

7
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,740
Oh my gosh.

8
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,260
I was looking for my lip balm.

9
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
My lip butter.

10
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:48,260
I was looking for my lip butter this entire time that the loading screen was happening.

11
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,820
And then I look over and it's right there.

12
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
Butter up those lips.

13
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,680
Better than a pooper.

14
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,640
Yay!

15
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,160
I wish... I kind of want to watch... Wait, if I click back...

16
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,120
I want to watch the intro video again.

17
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,580
I want to watch it one more time.

18
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,120
Classic.

19
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,860
Classic.

20
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
One more time.

21
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,120
One more time.

22
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,720
The intro one last time.

23
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,280
We just have to wait for it to do it's thing.

24
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm eating on a cough drop right now.

25
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,740
Anyways.

26
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,480
Nevermind.

27
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,060
No anyways.

28
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,300
Anyways, let's start the video!

29
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,360
How are you today, Mint?

30
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm good!

31
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,340
How are you?

32
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
That's what I was going to say.

33
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,040
I was going to say, how was your weekend?

34
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,440
I want to make sure that the volume is not going to blow us away.

35
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,740
Guys, I'm here!

36
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm here!

37
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,240
It's a doorknob.

38
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,820
That's my girl!

39
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,180
Pacific Ocean, I love you!

40
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,240
Alberto!

41
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Chico!

42
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,540
Cecile!

43
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,910
Oh my gosh, we did that!

44
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,270
We fought that!

45
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,450
We fought that!

46
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,450
Why are they out of order?

47
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,090
We fought that!

48
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,490
That thing is such a mess looking.

49
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,770
Huey, what were you thinking?

50
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,110
The thing is such a mess.

51
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,250
Oh my gosh, it's such a good intro.

52
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,350
With the peace signs and everything.

53
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,670
So good!

54
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,710
So good!

55
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,110
A mint cafe suddenly appeared in my area.

56
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,690
But it's not open because the doorknob is missing.

57
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,990
Wow, you better go catch it!

58
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,850
Freaky normal mint.

59
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,690
YAY!

60
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,510
Blood hole year!

61
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,110
Thanks!

62
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,230
Thank you!

63
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,730
Thank you, thank you!

64
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,550
Who do I hate more?

65
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,230
Huey or Naomi?

66
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,350
Naomi.

67
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,190
I actually hate Naomi.

68
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,110
Huey is fun to hate.

69
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,810
Huey is fun to hate.

70
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,750
Naomi, I actually hate her.

71
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,650
There is not a single character that I actually hate besides Naomi.

72
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,630
Everyone else I'm just like, oh I hate them!

73
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,730
Because it's silly.

74
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,850
But Naomi is actually just like pure unadulterated hatred.

75
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,090
Unadulterated.

76
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,090
Anyway, for those who don't know.

77
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,810
I did a member stream.

78
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,110
I did, I did, I did.

79
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,770
Oh my gosh, I saw Touhou 20.

80
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,270
What was it?

81
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,210
Fossilized something something?

82
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,570
Yeah, and Jojo part 7.

83
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,030
Actually, Steel Ball Run is the only Jojo that I know.

84
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,290
Yeah!

85
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,950
Funny.

86
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,670
Back to your regularly scheduled Peace Walker stream.

87
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,610
But yeah, I did a member stream.

88
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,050
Where I did some missions.

89
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,250
I did some missions so that we can finish today.

90
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,190
Because look, we're already on Zadornov mission.

91
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,510
So for those who don't know.

92
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,310
What the?

93
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,230
What do you mean please reconnect controller?

94
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,250
Are you dying?

95
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,800
One moment please.

96
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,580
I'm getting my cable.

97
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
I have it right here.

98
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,400
Just gotta unzip it.

99
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,880
For those who don't know, Zadornov escapes.

100
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,180
You get him in jail, in your little jail.

101
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,160
And he escapes.

102
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,300
Not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4.

103
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,180
Not even 5 times.

104
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,180
He will just keep...

105
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,140
Leaving for like 7 whole missions.

106
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
But...

107
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,320
Because he's a little rascal.

108
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,820
Thank you for the red.

109
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,620
Yeah, someone keeps turning Zadornov.

110
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,560
Exactly.

111
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,160
So we're gonna go find this guy again.

112
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,560
It's actually quite funny how you find him.

113
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,820
Because he's just...

114
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,840
Again.

115
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,680
Okay.

116
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720
Yeah, so we're gonna...

117
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,540
So for today, just before we start this too.

118
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,760
I want to obviously...

119
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,400
Complete the main ops.

120
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
Which we don't have so many left.

121
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,620
I believe we only have...

122
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,020
After this we'll have 3.

123
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,760
6, 7 and then the final boss.

124
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,020
And then there's a few side ops that I want to do.

125
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,680
Such as...

126
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,700
The monster hunter.

127
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,100
And...

128
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,760
It's your birthday!

129
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,480
Coa Coffee, happy birthday!

130
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,940
Wait,

131
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:37,920
hold on.

132
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm gonna go back actually.

133
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,720
Because I also want to do these AI weapon battles.

134
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,980
So that we can unlock...

135
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,800
A certain date.

136
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,220
Obviously we've done the date with Paz.

137
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,480
I did that last time.

138
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,080
But we have some other fun ones.

139
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,140
Like the Booyan mission and...

140
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,120
This one I unlocked because I really wanted to do this one!

141
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,200
The ghost photography!

142
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,740
Yes.

143
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,840
Very excited.

144
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,200
And...

145
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,100
So...

146
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,900
Cut, cut, cut.

147
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,540
So let's do Zadornov.

148
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,900
We're just gonna jump right into it.

149
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,900
I do have some...

150
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,100
I do have some stuff I gotta do tonight.

151
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,240
So I don't think today's stream will be super duper long.

152
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I might be eating my words.

153
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:31,940
But...

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,360
Yes.

155
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,100
We're just gonna...

156
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,720
Finish it up baby.

157
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,140
Join!

158
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,190
I'm still in Tuxedo Snake.

159
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,870
What if I forgot all my stuff?

160
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,370
That would be so funny.

161
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,070
Stealth.

162
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,590
We gotta go find Zadornov.

163
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,770
We gotta go find that guy.

164
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,510
We got our Fultons.

165
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,490
Are you ready?

166
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,430
Yeah!

167
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,650
You made it!

168
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,910
You made it.

169
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,170
Stealth.

170
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,810
Stealth.

171
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,590
I'm just gonna start.

172
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,290
Is that ok?

173
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,330
You have a countdown now.

174
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:28,670
Hurry.

175
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:31,890
Hello Mindo.

176
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,490
Hello!

177
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,110
I think next...

178
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,610
Here, I'll let you have more time.

179
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,490
I think next week too, I'll do Ground Zeroes.

180
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,890
Immediately after this game.

181
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,290
So that we can at least...

182
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,490
Cause that'll just be one stream.

183
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,150
And then...

184
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,030
Might wait a little bit before starting 5.

185
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,970
A little bit.

186
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,950
For 5, I'm definitely playing with mods.

187
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,890
I'm just gonna warn you guys.

188
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,890
In advance.

189
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,890
Yeah, Ground Zeroes is gonna be...

190
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,390
No spoilers everybody.

191
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:18,730
But...

192
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,130
Yeah.

193
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,870
There are mods in B?

194
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,590
Oh yeah!

195
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,310
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

196
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,150
There's mods.

197
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,070
One of them, which is really great is...

198
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,850
Every soldier can be S rank.

199
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:38,750
I just finished Beast Walker trying to catch up and those damn onion ninjas attacked again.

200
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,750
Solid Snake.

201
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,750
Alright, let's go find Zadornov.

202
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,050
Hello!

203
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,590
Ok.

204
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,450
What are you doing?

205
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,150
This guy will fall asleep.

206
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,590
No you didn't.

207
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,530
There we go.

208
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,250
Uh oh, wait.

209
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,930
You think he's gonna see anything?

210
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,930
Oh, uh oh.

211
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,450
I got him.

212
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,110
I got him, no worries.

213
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,390
We're not in an alert.

214
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,870
How many model swaps are you planning to use?

215
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,030
Probably...

216
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,530
Not a lot.

217
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,590
Probably not actually a lot.

218
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,390
I'm gonna take this guy.

219
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,470
Um, I don't know exactly what mods I'm gonna get just yet.

220
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,450
You don't think, oh wait.

221
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,570
He's probably not in this area, no?

222
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,730
Let's keep going.

223
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,360
You guys will know when you see him, maybe.

224
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,420
Are you one of the model swaps?

225
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
Ocelot is quiet, it's so funny.

226
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,140
You have to hear laughter?

227
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,580
Wait, you can hear Zadornov laughing?

228
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,960
I haven't heard him laughing before.

229
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,620
What?

230
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh, what the...

231
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,180
Oh, nice shot!

232
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
Oh dang, I'm gonna get this guy in the butt.

233
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,460
Uh oh, wait.

234
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,820
No!

235
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,020
Wait, who?

236
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,820
Where?

237
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,260
How?

238
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,540
Wait, how did they see?

239
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,880
Wait, how did they see?

240
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,160
Where is he anyway?

241
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,800
Oh, there he is.

242
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,360
Oh, I'm reloading.

243
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,460
What did we do wrong?

244
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,180
What is it?

245
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Oh, there is nothing over here.

246
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,740
Oh!

247
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,120
Sorry, that was me.

248
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,580
That was definitely me.

249
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,020
Sorry.

250
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,580
That was definitely me.

251
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,660
He's

252
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:30,890
fine.

253
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:31,950
Don't worry about it.

254
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,130
Let's keep going.

255
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,870
Let's ignore those guys.

256
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,070
I feel like he's not gonna be here either too, right?

257
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,570
I feel.

258
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,010
How did you get spotted?

259
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,250
I'm just...

260
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,350
I'm just not sneaky enough.

261
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,550
I don't remember where he is here, I'll be honest.

262
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,590
I'm gonna do it.

263
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,210
I'm gonna become a box.

264
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,630
Snake in.

265
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,110
Wait.

266
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,900
Oh, how the hell did you get in there so fast?

267
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,640
What the?

268
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,140
Wait.

269
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,280
Draw.

270
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,960
Um, am I too... am I too...

271
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,060
Ok, nevermind.

272
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,620
I'm not gonna do it.

273
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,140
I give up.

274
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,180
That guy got in there so fast.

275
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,460
Ok, I'll take the...

276
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,880
Yeah, there we go.

277
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,180
Ok.

278
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,240
And get this guy.

279
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,340
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

280
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

281
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,820
Did we get him?

282
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,720
Ok, you got him.

283
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,760
Let's go.

284
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh, there is another guy.

285
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,740
Ah!

286
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,640
Ah!

287
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,120
I tried to hold him up!

288
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,940
What happened?

289
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,380
Why?

290
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,380
Oh my gosh, where did that guy come from?

291
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,220
Yeah, take him down.

292
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,240
What you got?

293
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,560
Did we look around this area?

294
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,800
I don't know why I'm just like deciding that he's so far away.

295
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,140
You know?

296
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,120
I'm just... maybe... Oh, is he up here?

297
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,800
Let's check.

298
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,600
You're so right.

299
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,880
We're investigating the area.

300
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,820
There is always stuff up here though.

301
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,100
That's good to take, I suppose.

302
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,600
Oh no!

303
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,400
Are you ok?

304
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
Wait, why is the...

305
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,680
Why does it say we're in alert mode?

306
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,720
You see that?

307
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,060
Are you ok?

308
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,140
He's like, are you ok?

309
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,420
You're

310
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,620
gonna tire yourself out that way.

311
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,020
It's all me now.

312
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:09,700
I

313
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,110
don't know where the doorknob is.

314
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,750
Wow, the moon.

315
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,620
I don't know where he is.

316
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,400
Oh shoot.

317
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,340
What are you talking about?

318
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,300
What are you talking about?

319
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,860
Happy Butter, I can't do this alone!

320
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,800
You left me!

321
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,640
What?

322
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,880
What do you mean there he is?

323
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,920
Wait, where did they go?

324
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
Oh, they're all coming down.

325
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,520
That's so funny.

326
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,680
Wait, I wonder if I can just hide here and CQC them each time.

327
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,740
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

328
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,360
Oh wait, he's gonna get...

329
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,620
Ok.

330
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,160
Nothing.

331
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,980
Rise and shine.

332
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
This is patrol.

333
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:29,900
All clear.

334
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,820
Understood.

335
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,280
Stay vigilant.

336
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,400
Why is my sneaking suit so bad even though it's night time?

337
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,220
I don't understand.

338
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,770
Can't be imagining things.

339
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,260
Please don't.

340
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,440
Oh, you're going the other way.

341
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,600
What's going on?

342
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,100
Oh shoot.

343
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,880
Can't be imagining things.

344
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,460
We're under attack.

345
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,800
Going to alert status.

346
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,320
No!

347
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm just looking for a man.

348
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,840
Please!

349
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,500
I don't care about you guys.

350
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,050
Just looking for a guy.

351
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,710
What is that?

352
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,830
Wait, what do I hear?

353
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,730
I hear footsteps.

354
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,910
They're not coming from behind me are they?

355
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,050
That would be so scary.

356
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,510
All clear.

357
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,430
Oh my god, there's a guy right there.

358
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,810
But it is not Zadornov.

359
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,540
Oh, that's messed up.

360
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
Just aim, snake.

361
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,390
Zadornov!

362
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,770
What?

363
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,780
Oh shoot.

364
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,500
Wait, I can get him.

365
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,860
Oh shoot!

366
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,740
Why did you have to yell?

367
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,600
Speak!

368
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,940
Where did you see him?

369
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,880
Oh, you are so useless.

370
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,300
You are so useless.

371
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,740
Is anyone else around?

372
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,700
Even?

373
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,840
I think this was the guy down here, no?

374
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,850
Yeah, I heard him climb up the stairs.

375
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,180
Zadornov!

376
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,620
Where could he be?

377
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,800
Where could he be?

378
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,680
Where could he be?

379
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,160
Zadornov!

380
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,050
No, no, no.

381
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,290
I tried to...I didn't want to...

382
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,190
Did you see him?

383
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,850
Gave the right answer.

384
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,330
Donkey.

385
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,730
OK!

386
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,710
OK!

387
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,350
You!

388
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,090
Metal Gear.

389
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,510
You!

390
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,270
Fish.

391
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,050
Metal Gear.

392
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,280
This is the one from before, no?

393
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,060
It's...OK.

394
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,340
You!

395
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,500
Jackpot!

396
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,620
Mailing!

397
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,560
So cute!

398
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,100
Empty.

399
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,300
Nothing, yeah.

400
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,660
No worries, we know.

401
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,540
Oh, this one was so much easier.

402
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,800
All you have to do is actually not find him.

403
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,960
Oh, Capybara, I'm sorry that you disconnected.

404
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,680
I didn't need you.

405
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,580
Sorry.

406
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!

407
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,760
When you meet...

408
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,620
Oh,

409
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,820
yes.

410
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,700
That's weird.

411
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,080
So that's Zadornov.

412
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,340
Yep, that's our guy.

413
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,380
OK.

414
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,720
We...

415
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,900
We...

416
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,620
Then we'll do some side-offs.

417
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,820
Oh my gosh.

418
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,360
I thought you wanted to join us.

419
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,060
You liar.

420
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,920
We have Crane.

421
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,960
Crane, are you any good?

422
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
I like to call people on the radio when I'm on a mission.

423
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,040
It's a good way to get useful info and it reminds me that I'm not alone out there.

424
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,540
You're not bad.

425
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,480
I guess.

426
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,760
Could be worse.

427
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,500
Twelve months already?

428
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,860
Thank you so much!

429
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,920
Thank you!

430
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,360
Where's your headband?

431
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,700
We gave it up, remember?

432
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,700
Well, I guess if you don't remember.

433
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,840
Snake takes it off at the end of the first ending.

434
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,480
Because he said the boss rejected him, so...

435
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,720
He rejects the one thing that he has of the boss.

436
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,380
OK, soon we'll get a better Fulton.

437
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,740
What should we do first?

438
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,160
Wait.

439
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,500
What's the mission where we get the palico?

440
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,060
Guys, which one is it?

441
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,940
I can't remember.

442
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,260
Which one?

443
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,880
Which one?

444
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,220
Which one is it?

445
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,640
What we can do is a couple of these and stuff.

446
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,900
I don't remember what number it is.

447
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,740
Don't you need to listen to the Chico tapes first?

448
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,360
I did that!

449
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,140
Yep, yep, yep.

450
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,360
For the anybody...

451
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,360
For anyone who...

452
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,840
I guess...

453
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,280
I did a membership stream where I did a bunch of stuff off stream.

454
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,980
Or rather, in the membership stream.

455
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,180
So it was a bunch of grindy stuff.

456
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,180
That was...

457
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:55,300
So I just kind of wanted to be able to come in here and then...

458
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,280
Get a bunch of stuff.

459
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,320
Get stuff.

460
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:58,940
Died.

461
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,400
Yes.

462
00:28:59,560 --> 00:28:59,860
Sorry.

463
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,560
29!

464
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,500
Thank you!

465
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,520
Extra Ops 29.

466
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,560
29, 29.

467
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,320
Ok, here we go.

468
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,500
Oh, it's just me.

469
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,200
How lonely.

470
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,720
Ok, start the mission.

471
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,120
Wait.

472
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
Oh, I need the C4.

473
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,380
I have the C4.

474
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,300
Let's go.

475
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,740
How would you ever figure that out naturally?

476
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,280
I... Actually, this one I don't know.

477
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,460
This one I don't know how would you figure it out.

478
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,980
Because obviously listening to Chico you'll figure it out.

479
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,540
Or rather, Chico will... I thought... I don't know.

480
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,460
The game doesn't tell you directly.

481
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,300
It's crazy, no?

482
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,360
See?

483
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:57,720
See?

484
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:57,800
See?

485
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,340
He's there!

486
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,760
Monster?

487
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,580
I miss my cat.

488
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,300
Poké Village theme.

489
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,100
Pokémon!

490
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,280
My sails pitched me out!

491
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,360
On that island there are undiscovered monsters that drop them.

492
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,820
It's up to be pretty handy.

493
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
We got it.

494
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,740
We got it.

495
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,260
Do I still have to complete the mission?

496
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,970
A talking cat.

497
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:49,930
Nice!

498
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,560
Awesome.

499
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,680
Ok, so we have that now.

500
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,250
I kind of want to do this one.

501
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,850
Wait, this one.

502
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:16,990
Can we take a photo of the spirit roaming the small maintenance dock of the US Missile Base?

503
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,890
Spirits can be detected with the audio visualization equipment.

504
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,990
Let's get this mission started.

505
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,470
Complete the mission and proceed to the Fulton recovery point so we can get you back alive and well.

506
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,850
Good luck out there.

507
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,230
Thank you guys!

508
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,730
Basically we have to do missions now to have Zdornov escape again.

509
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,350
So fun!

510
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,210
I don't know.

511
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,250
So basically we can just do whatever we want until he escapes again.

512
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,670
So fun!

513
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,330
So what?

514
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,290
Do I need the camera?

515
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,980
Which I had, apparently.

516
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,500
And then, what was it?

517
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,220
The audio...

518
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,800
Not Soliton.

519
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,140
This one?

520
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,400
The surround indicator?

521
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,720
Audio visualization equipment.

522
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,560
Yeah, that one.

523
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:14,880
Oh!

524
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,940
It can only be me!

525
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,620
Lonely.

526
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,420
Ok.

527
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,460
Time for... Time for Fatal Frame.

528
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,940
Can you lure the freaky ghosts with magazine?

529
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,580
Maybe.

530
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,930
Freaky!

531
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,660
Wait.

532
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,860
Do I have to go around?

533
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
So spooky!

534
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,840
Is it down?

535
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,820
Maybe up here?

536
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,980
It's so scary!

537
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,280
Spooky!

538
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,860
Wait, let go.

539
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,100
Oh I can't.

540
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,740
Nevermind, just kidding.

541
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,800
I thought I would be able to hang.

542
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,240
A ghost!

543
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:41,680
A ghost!

544
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,460
I love how many random missions there are in this game.

545
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,340
Obviously, I'm a ghost.

546
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,770
Let's see.

547
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,710
How well did I do?

548
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,150
Piece of cake, he said.

549
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,790
Let's go.

550
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,270
Let's go, let's go.

551
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,010
S rank.

552
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,410
If I don't... If I get less than an S rank though...

553
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,590
In anything that is ghost related, I would be so sad.

554
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,110
Ghost photography.

555
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,630
Oh!

556
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,710
This one too!

557
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,450
Dead man's treasure.

558
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,110
Retrieve all the items from the Cloud Forest of Central Heredia.

559
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,730
Beware of ghosts.

560
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,310
Shall we try?

561
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,170
Heredia.

562
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,270
Heredia?

563
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,710
I don't know, sorry.

564
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,070
Trying to take a picture of a cute ghost.

565
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,230
Oh wait, she's right there.

566
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,770
Oh wait, I'm winking but you can't see.

567
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,930
Ok, who wants to join?

568
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,430
Don't die.

569
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,590
Don't die.

570
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,030
Oh, look back!

571
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,350
Don't forget your camera.

572
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,890
Oh, and your surroundings.

573
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,890
Mito, I plan on getting drunk tonight while playing DMC1.

574
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,430
Pray for me.

575
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,350
PS, it will wreck you.

576
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,030
Sounds like a Saturday.

577
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,630
What did you just put on?

578
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,750
What did you just put on?

579
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,530
What did you just wear?

580
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:46,910
Are you ready?

581
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,830
Let's go.

582
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,520
Gather all the... Retrieve all the items.

583
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,080
I do feel like I vaguely remember this mission.

584
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,660
Not all the 07s.

585
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,760
Not all the 07s.

586
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,770
Let's go, baby.

587
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,830
I can't wait to do the final boss fight.

588
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,190
It's so good, you guys.

589
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,070
It's so good.

590
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,830
Oh, that's what you're wearing.

591
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,810
Where

592
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,900
is the ghost at?

593
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,860
I want to see one.

594
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,260
Curse you.

595
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,260
Curse you.

596
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:54,900
Oh wait.

597
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,550
This way.

598
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,610
Where is he?

599
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,890
I guess it doesn't work.

600
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,390
I got one item.

601
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:15,730
Where are we?

602
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,670
Sorry.

603
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,770
I'm scared!

604
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,090
I'm scared.

605
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,010
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

606
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,190
What are you doing?

607
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,430
Oh my god, you son of a bitch!

608
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,630
I'm faster than the ghost.

609
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:46,570
I think.

610
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,090
Bye bye!

611
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,190
He's not coming after me now.

612
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,140
What?

613
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,580
I hear you.

614
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,680
I hear you behind me.

615
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,840
Whatever.

616
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,520
Who was that?

617
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,860
What are you doing?

618
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,400
What?

619
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,640
What the heck was that?

620
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,380
What?

621
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Wait, high five.

622
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,420
So scary.

623
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:52,700
Ok.

624
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:53,920
Anyway.

625
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:55,980
Oh, whoops.

626
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,680
Curse you.

627
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,560
Curse you.

628
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm going to get this.

629
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,660
Can I save this guy?

630
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,120
Oh wait.

631
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,420
I want to save him.

632
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,600
Hold on, I'm going to try to.

633
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,900
Why does he moan like that?

634
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,220
Why does he moan like that?

635
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000
How many more do we have?

636
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,640
Just one more.

637
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,640
Spooky.

638
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,500
It's so spooky.

639
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,190
Like a baby.

640
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,230
Over here.

641
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,450
Where is it?

642
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,990
It's got to be like on this side.

643
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,630
Nope, there it is.

644
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,110
I see it.

645
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,100
Where is it?

646
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,830
I'll help you!

647
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,270
Oh my goodness, what's going on here?

648
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,130
Oh, sorry.

649
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:03,690
Anyway.

650
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:04,910
Goodbye!

651
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,760
That was kind of sexy, no?

652
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,600
That was kind of sexy!

653
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,020
Right in front of me!

654
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Oh there it is.

655
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,020
Oops, I messed up.

656
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,640
You missed.

657
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,320
Oops.

658
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,420
Thrilled, I'm sure.

659
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,700
Nice.

660
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,520
I don't think we are getting an S on that one.

661
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,600
That was so silly, right?

662
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,880
Alright.

663
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,100
Time for some of the more difficult missions.

664
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,400
Everybody.

665
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,400
Just kidding!

666
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,820
Great!

667
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,880
What?

668
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,960
I think...

669
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,220
That's a good point.

670
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,680
No kidding!

671
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,320
Oops, I didn't mean to press that one.

672
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,700
I meant to press the mission.

673
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,900
No kidding, huh?

674
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,200
It's so crazy too how much...

675
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,140
How much Kaz's tone has changed.

676
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,760
Since in this game to the other one.

677
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,600
96!

678
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,720
So close.

679
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,840
This game he's just like, yeah let's keep Zdornov.

680
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,020
And in the next game he's like, no people ever.

681
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,640
You guessed it, Zdornov has escaped from Mother Base again.

682
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,020
Find him and bring him back.

683
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,420
Okidoki.

684
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,120
You know, I might be crazy, but I'm pretty sure Zdornov has done it again.

685
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,160
Oops, he did it again.

686
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,680
He escaped.

687
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,100
We're at the Miner's Residence.

688
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,020
Vargara!

689
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,440
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

690
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,680
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

691
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,060
Maybe I will use the surround indicator.

692
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,620
Or night vision.

693
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,860
I don't know what would be easier to find him.

694
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,180
Something.

695
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,480
This should be fine.

696
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,280
Today is my birthday!

697
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,520
Pentomo poncho, happy birthday!

698
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,520
Gotta get a metal gear, happy birthday.

699
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,160
About to go to a convention, buy some more mint porridge.

700
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Happy birthday, congratulations.

701
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,220
Happy birthday with salutations.

702
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,400
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

703
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,700
Happy birthday to you.

704
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,360
Happy birthday poncho!

705
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,720
Happy, happy birthday!

706
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,050
Let's go.

707
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,050
Zdornov more like Britney Spears.

708
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:53,290
Oops.

709
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,710
Did it again with your heart.

710
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,250
What we probably will do is some of the side ops.

711
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,550
Before we do the final Zdornov mission.

712
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:10,150
Say we unlock it in a couple missions.

713
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,550
We'll probably just finish up the side ops.

714
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,410
And then go into the finale, finale.

715
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,890
Okey dokey.

716
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:29,860
Zdorn...

717
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,860
If I were a Zdornov...

718
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,660
Oh there it is.

719
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,480
Thank you!

720
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,400
Where is...who's dying down there?

721
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:51,660
Huh?

722
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,420
Okey,

723
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,000
I think we might have to continue onwards.

724
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,840
I don't...oh.

725
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,800
Anyway.

726
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,920
Can't be imagining things.

727
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,480
You might be.

728
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,140
You might be.

729
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,040
You good boy Goro?

730
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,220
You wanna go to the next area?

731
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,380
Or do you think he's here?

732
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,940
Why was that there?

733
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,260
I thought he was gonna be under it for a second.

734
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,210
I thought he was gonna be in there for a second.

735
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,550
That was pretty crazy, no?

736
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,370
Wait, can I get the...

737
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,470
Assassin's Creed one here?

738
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,750
Hold on, hold on.

739
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:02,410
Wait for Goro.

740
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,030
I wanna try and get the Assassin's Creed.

741
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,570
Thank you.

742
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,280
I'm gonna try and get it.

743
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,600
Since I have an open slot...

744
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,220
I want it.

745
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,080
I want it, I want it, I want it.

746
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,360
What the...

747
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,960
No!

748
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,840
No!

749
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,340
Mister?

750
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,380
You son of a gun!

751
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,080
Step on him, Snitch!

752
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,180
Tap his butt.

753
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,540
Tap his butt.

754
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,840
Tap his butt.

755
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,500
Tap his butt.

756
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,560
No, no, no.

757
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,360
Tap his butt.

758
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,340
Tap his butt.

759
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,700
Why am I saying it in like the severance?

760
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,960
Tap his butt.

761
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,960
Tap his butt.

762
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,140
Tap his butt.

763
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,300
Tap his butt.

764
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,260
Tap his butt.

765
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,640
Tap his butt.

766
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,420
Ok, that's enough of that.

767
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,700
Wow, that was so easy.

768
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,060
What?

769
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,470
There's so many items.

770
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,560
Stun box.

771
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,500
Big Boss!

772
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,520
There's like a song of...

773
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,080
What's it called?

774
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,400
Of the severance theme.

775
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:02,380
Like someone put lyrics to it and it's so stupid, but it gets stuck in my head too where it's just like...

776
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,580
Heli's hot.

777
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,180
Milchick's hot.

778
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,700
Everyone's hot.

779
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,160
Heli is hot.

780
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,040
She is hot.

781
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,540
Zadornov!

782
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,720
Can't believe he was in the love box.

783
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,520
Whatever.

784
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,220
Okie dokie.

785
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,380
Nice.

786
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,480
Nice, nice, nice.

787
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,280
Wow, all because I wanted to do the Assassin's Creed.

788
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,420
All because I wanted to do Assassin's Creed I found him.

789
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,900
We have Rathalos right here.

790
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,460
Wait a second.

791
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,000
Is this...Are these the ones that we need to do?

792
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,780
So Chrysalis, Cocoon, Peace Walker.

793
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,500
If we do all of these then I can unlock the final date.

794
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,900
Imagine you guys might have run in circles.

795
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,980
I know, right?

796
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,580
You need the...Oh, the custom...I knew there was another one.

797
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
They unlock after the final boss.

798
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,140
Ok, nevermind then.

799
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,900
Well, I have to do something else.

800
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,820
Anyway, what should we do?

801
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,560
Maybe...

802
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,360
Let's do Rathalos.

803
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:27,820
No?

804
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,060
Let's do Rathalos.

805
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,600
We gotta wait for him to go again.

806
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,920
We may also need to build Zeke.

807
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,700
So we wouldn't want to do these anyway.

808
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,600
Perhaps.

809
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,160
I don't know yet.

810
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,240
I don't know what you want to do yet.

811
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,760
Let's do...

812
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,530
You need to build Zeke fully.

813
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:02,910
Ok, then we'll do these battles.

814
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,390
And then we'll do Rathalos.

815
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,410
Again, we have to do a couple missions anyway probably because this is a door norm.

816
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:10,870
Let's do this one.

817
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,450
I'm scared.

818
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:18,670
I'm scared.

819
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:20,970
I'm scared.

820
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,430
Come on in people.

821
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,530
Go with the team.

822
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,170
Wait, where is all my...

823
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,850
Where is all my weapons?

824
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,990
Where is my buildout?

825
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:37,930
Combat.

826
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:39,630
Ok, fine.

827
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,150
I'll go with...

828
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,030
Yeah, you are so right.

829
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,390
Let's go with...

830
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:52,790
Good stuff.

831
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:56,390
Go with the team.

832
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,370
Go with the team.

833
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:00,690
VENCERAMOS!

834
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,450
RPG.

835
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,210
Saber.

836
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,330
Then, chaff.

837
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:22,310
And...

838
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,610
Wait, is this the aerial mine?

839
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:24,990
And...

840
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,150
Supply mark?

841
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:31,850
Wait.

842
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,840
Strike mark?

843
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:38,600
Maybe.

844
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,420
Wait, which one is...

845
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,440
Is this the flying one?

846
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,940
I can't remember.

847
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:46,920
Wait.

848
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,060
I don't even know which one I clicked.

849
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,280
Oh, it's the flying one.

850
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,700
Let me do...

851
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,520
Instead of RPG, let me do F.I.M.

852
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,000
Let's do the F.I.M.

853
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,400
instead.

854
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,900
We want the one that locks on.

855
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,020
That should be fine.

856
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,140
I guess it's ok.

857
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,140
Chat, is Snake invisible yet?

858
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,580
Or is that the other one?

859
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:26,680
Hole?

860
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,080
Hole?

861
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,240
I'm confused.

862
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,020
I'm sorry.

863
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,980
Unequipped.

864
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,940
Yeah, this should be fine because we have the supply...

865
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,960
Let me also do... Wait, can I do the throwing supply mark or two?

866
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,540
Oh, I can only do one or the other.

867
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,060
We'll do this one then.

868
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,660
Rations, chips...

869
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,460
I got my camera.

870
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,600
I got my curry.

871
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,160
I got my stuff.

872
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,620
Ok, this should be fine then.

873
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,330
Lucky!

874
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,350
Brooks, Mobius, Chikara!

875
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,090
Look at us.

876
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,190
So worldwide.

877
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:13,610
Let's go!

878
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,660
Oh, I get it.

879
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,100
Invisible.

880
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,480
I get it.

881
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,030
I get it.

882
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,430
I get it.

883
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,560
I get it.

884
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,230
I don't even know how that meme started.

885
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:54,230
I don't know either.

886
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,270
I just know that it's like blown up.

887
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,310
Hot, cold, man.

888
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,830
Oh,

889
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,120
you're in Amanda's outfit.

890
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,620
That's why I said venceremos.

891
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:29,670
I feel like we didn't... We needed a bunch of stuff for Zeke, but also not so much stuff.

892
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,730
So, I guess it's fine.

893
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,810
I was like, where the heck is...

894
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,730
No!

895
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,910
I totally, definitely...

896
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,970
Take cover?

897
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,670
Where is she?

898
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,990
Good

899
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,880
job team!

900
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,340
Where is she?

901
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,640
Change that.

902
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,780
Lock on!

903
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,980
Why did I switch to stop?

904
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,880
Holy cow!

905
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,120
Oh my god, you guys.

906
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,300
Holy... Holy damage!

907
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,260
She says, go see the Project Sekai movie!

908
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,790
I think I missed the last one, which is really unfortunate.

909
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:33,410
She...

910
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,490
She...

911
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:36,190
Oh, sorry.

912
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,790
I didn't mean to steal your claymores!

913
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,950
It's an enemy closing in.

914
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,410
The dodge.

915
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,450
She's like...

916
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:46,630
Oh!

917
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,330
Are you okay, movie?

918
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,250
That was crazy.

919
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,190
Ouch!

920
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:55,590
I'm okay.

921
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,470
Kind of.

922
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,210
That was pretty rough though, not gonna lie.

923
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,350
Where is my supply marker?

924
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:02,630
There we go.

925
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:07,750
Please!

926
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:08,750
There we... Thank you.

927
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,350
Oh wait, is it gonna go on top of this?

928
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,990
I think I might have... Thank goodness, it didn't.

929
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,800
Oh, it's already reloaded.

930
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,120
I'm gonna do another supply marker.

931
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,600
Just have it.

932
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,300
This is my corner.

933
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,320
Okay, my bad.

934
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,560
My bad.

935
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,000
My bad.

936
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,300
My bad.

937
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,660
My bad.

938
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,020
My bad.

939
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,040
I have it ready though.

940
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,160
I have it ready.

941
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,540
My supply corner, yeah.

942
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,750
Oh, I missed.

943
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:02,490
Sorry everybody.

944
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,070
Sorry.

945
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,390
I got her tail.

946
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:11,890
I'm trying!

947
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:12,770
What do you mean?

948
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,850
What else would I use?

949
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:20,930
I tried.

950
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,980
Please, snake!

951
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,840
Reload!

952
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,240
Reload!

953
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,720
Reload!

954
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,270
They are sending out a cardboard box as we speak.

955
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:45,510
Dicado is taking a nap.

956
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,070
I love that.

957
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:50,450
Please ma

958
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,860
'am.

959
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,440
Please ma'am, come back!

960
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,190
I saw that.

961
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,130
That was pretty sad.

962
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,390
I saw that happen.

963
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,340
Such a cool looking boss.

964
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,120
I know!

965
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,060
She is so cool, yeah.

966
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,720
Ah, the kidnappers.

967
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,440
Where are you?

968
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:00,240
There you are.

969
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:06,800
No!

970
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,020
I missed!

971
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,140
You stinkin'!

972
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,720
I think that's gonna miss too.

973
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,500
It missed twice!

974
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,080
No!

975
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,820
She is too speedy.

976
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,110
I died.

977
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,290
Oops, I guess I died.

978
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,410
Oops, I guess I died.

979
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,450
Oops, I guess I died.

980
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,590
Oops, I guess I died.

981
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,730
Oops, I guess I died.

982
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,850
Oops, I guess I died.

983
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,810
Sorry, I just...What are you apologizing for?

984
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:47,230
What happened?

985
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,430
What did you do?

986
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,630
What did you do?

987
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,670
Oops, I guess I died.

988
01:01:58,790 --> 01:01:59,690
I'm going in!

989
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,750
Oh yeah, we gotta attack.

990
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:08,230
Thank you!

991
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,410
Oops, I guess I died.

992
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,030
I forgot you gotta hit it first.

993
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,620
I know, right?

994
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,620
How nice of her to line up so we can just sneak on in right there.

995
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,160
OK guys, take it.

996
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:30,380
Give me...Attack lots so I can get lots of parts please.

997
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,720
I don't remember what parts I need, but I'm just gonna take everything.

998
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,600
I'll just take as much as I can.

999
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,240
Take all the parts I can.

1000
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,460
Give me parts.

1001
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,860
OK guys, thank you.

1002
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,580
Yep guys, I hear you.

1003
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
I hear you buddy.

1004
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,940
I hear you buddy.

1005
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,600
Grab the SSS.

1006
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,100
Hmm...

1007
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,500
I did not do it optimized.

1008
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,460
Give me more time!

1009
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,500
Please!

1010
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,540
OK, Huey!

1011
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:24,960
Thank you!

1012
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,220
Oh, we just got a new one.

1013
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:32,820
This one.

1014
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,100
Go, go, go, go, go, go, sneak!

1015
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,600
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.

1016
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,000
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1017
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,240
Nice.

1018
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,440
Oh, OK.

1019
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,340
OK

1020
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,900
Good haul.

1021
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:01,840
Good loot.

1022
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,100
We're getting stuff baby.

1023
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,880
Good job team!

1024
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:09,980
Good job everybody!

1025
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:13,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1026
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,920
Isn't there a way to extend the time?

1027
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:22,520
There is if... I think they have to attack certain things on the guy outside.

1028
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,400
To extend the time.

1029
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,280
I didn't actually... I didn't optimize that, but that's OK.

1030
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,200
We're fine.

1031
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,460
It's fine, I suppose.

1032
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,200
It's fine.

1033
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,260
It's fine.

1034
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,740
I meant hello!

1035
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:43,840
Hello, hello!

1036
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,600
Alright.

1037
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,360
Valenciano.

1038
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,100
You're welcome!

1039
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,520
Thanks Huey!

1040
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,440
Thank you for 12 months!

1041
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,740
And then all of us just stare at it.

1042
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,960
The stare is too funny.

1043
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,460
Great job BisonWisp!

1044
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,420
Thanks Rooks!

1045
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,280
Yeah, let's go.

1046
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,650
What?

1047
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,650
Taking it slow.

1048
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,570
S rank.

1049
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:53,690
OK.

1050
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,390
I didn't pull a single M.

1051
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,210
Huh?

1052
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:01,270
How?

1053
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,650
I didn't pull that.

1054
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,630
I didn't pull any M.

1055
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,190
What?

1056
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,730
Strange little fan zone.

1057
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:20,950
Yippee!

1058
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,200
I don't know how that happened, but it happened.

1059
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,200
The game disconnected me after the mission.

1060
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:33,900
Oh no!

1061
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,520
Thanks for helping Jukedo.

1062
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,260
The M is in their heart.

1063
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,130
Walk unit.

1064
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,870
OK, we still need that.

1065
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,610
Are the legs...

1066
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:04,510
Are the legs...

1067
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:09,110
What did the legs be?

1068
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,510
What's first?

1069
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:17,150
OK, so we're gonna try and get C parts.

1070
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:18,450
We need pink.

1071
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,170
We need...

1072
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:25,910
We need pink?

1073
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,590
Do I need both legs?

1074
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,610
Or is it just one leg?

1075
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:32,290
And we need yellow.

1076
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:37,090
Yellow and pink are our priorities.

1077
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,410
Just one.

1078
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:41,730
OK.

1079
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:48,050
Legs are the first thing, but it wouldn't let me put it down.

1080
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,050
So we need the walk unit.

1081
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:51,690
OK.

1082
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:55,230
I guess you need something to attach the legs to.

1083
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:55,650
OK.

1084
01:07:58,530 --> 01:07:58,890
Soon.

1085
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,530
Let's go do another one.

1086
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,710
That was great, guys.

1087
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:04,310
Good job.

1088
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:07,630
OK, so...

1089
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:08,170
Pink and yellow.

1090
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:11,250
Pink and yellow.

1091
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,270
Let's do cocoon.

1092
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:27,570
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1093
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,570
Thank you!

1094
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:30,830
Pink and yellow.

1095
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:31,970
Alright, guys.

1096
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,390
Let's do this, baby.

1097
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,130
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

1098
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,030
To complete Zeke, you need parts.

1099
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:40,110
You only get parts by attacking the AI pod, so the rest stays intact.

1100
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,370
Attacking other parts gets you boards.

1101
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:44,250
I see.

1102
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:45,930
Snake!

1103
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,130
Good boy, good boy!

1104
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:47,930
Ride team!

1105
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,090
Welcome team!

1106
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,150
I'm gonna go with the team.

1107
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:52,430
As I always do.

1108
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:53,710
This is how we do it in SAO.

1109
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:53,870
OK.

1110
01:08:56,830 --> 01:09:01,210
So we are trying to attack the AI pod as much as possible.

1111
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:02,970
Thanks Mito for the fun battle.

1112
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:04,370
Mobius, thank you!

1113
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,350
I really appreciate it.

1114
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,120
Go with the team.

1115
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:22,710
Yeah, try not to attack the armor points.

1116
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,490
Armor parts as much as possible.

1117
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:27,630
But I know it can't be helped sometimes, you know.

1118
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,270
What's going on here?

1119
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,390
What's going on here?

1120
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:41,510
OK.

1121
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:43,670
Are we ready, team?

1122
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:46,910
Are we ready, team?

1123
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:49,690
Y'all?

1124
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,040
Any more time?

1125
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,690
Yeah, yeah, so true.

1126
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,230
This one is pretty slow.

1127
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,390
So it's not too hard to hit only the pod.

1128
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,030
That's so true.

1129
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,090
True, true.

1130
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:11,790
Snake!

1131
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:14,030
Oh, there we go.

1132
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,130
Snake?

1133
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,890
Snake?

1134
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:16,810
Snake!

1135
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,320
And Zdornov is still not even...

1136
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,160
He's still...

1137
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,120
Wait, so we're gonna have to fight all of these again?

1138
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,200
As...

1139
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,260
We're gonna have to fight all of these again, but in...

1140
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,040
Uh...

1141
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,420
The other mode?

1142
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,540
You know, there's a human slingshot weapon.

1143
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,300
Wait, really?

1144
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,700
So silly.

1145
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,560
Custom version.

1146
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,660
Yeah, we have to do...

1147
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,200
Yeah, I keep forgetting the name of them.

1148
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,040
Custom version.

1149
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,060
I guess that's OK.

1150
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,720
I guess that's OK.

1151
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,640
Maybe I should have done these more off-stream.

1152
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,820
That's OK, though.

1153
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:19,040
But also, just getting Zdornov is so...

1154
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,900
I mean, we have to do these anyways, because we got a complete Zeke, so...

1155
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:25,660
I guess it makes sense.

1156
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:26,880
AI pod!

1157
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:33,980
Not Shucklehead.

1158
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,360
Yeah, this thing is so ugly.

1159
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:36,980
I'm sorry.

1160
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,760
Huey, what the hell were you thinking?

1161
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,320
This thing is a mess.

1162
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,020
This thing is just... There's so many parts to it.

1163
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,360
It's ugly.

1164
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,120
It's just so ugly.

1165
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,540
It's like Shuckle... The Shucklehead is pretty cute, but this is like...

1166
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:56,040
It looks like a...

1167
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,560
Like something...

1168
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,040
It looks like...

1169
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,660
Oh my god.

1170
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:07,980
Hello?

1171
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,540
Why am I... I'm not reloading.

1172
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:12,980
Thank you.

1173
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,200
Let's not have Lime Soda.

1174
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:21,700
Thank you.

1175
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:30,340
It looks like a toy truck.

1176
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:33,850
Like,

1177
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:43,410
you know, when you have a construction toy as a kid.

1178
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:44,970
Are you OK, Berky-boy?

1179
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:46,310
Wow, you dodged that crazy.

1180
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:52,940
Tonka gear.

1181
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,040
Yes, yes, yes.

1182
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,000
What the hell happened to him?

1183
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,700
Just making sure.

1184
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,350
I did too soon.

1185
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,490
Don't do that.

1186
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,800
Metal slug?

1187
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,400
It makes me think of that game's bosses.

1188
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,280
Oh, I know what you mean.

1189
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,000
I know what you mean.

1190
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,860
I'm very

1191
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:32,540
sorry.

1192
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,100
I didn't see who raided, but thank you.

1193
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:56,970
Not at me.

1194
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,200
I want to get underneath it.

1195
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,280
I want to get underneath it.

1196
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,040
Wow, this thing is so tanky.

1197
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,220
Lucky, thanks for the gifted.

1198
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,220
Do you think it will happen?

1199
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,160
Do you think it will happen if I'm under here?

1200
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:47,290
It almost...

1201
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,160
Scary, scary.

1202
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,100
OK, not going over there.

1203
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,420
Oh, I am out.

1204
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,900
I'm just chilling here.

1205
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,260
Is it really Miku?

1206
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,500
It's actually a Vocaloid, yeah.

1207
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,320
It is a real Vocaloid.

1208
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:46,710
You're pretty good.

1209
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,410
Margie's got his little corner over there.

1210
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:03,470
You're dying, buddy.

1211
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:04,850
Wait, who did we lose?

1212
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:06,790
We lost somebody.

1213
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:10,390
Wait, who did we lose?

1214
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,380
Oh Porkyboy, you're back!

1215
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,080
Oh, it was the kind, kind health.

1216
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:27,560
You're right.

1217
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,650
What is...Am I hearing?

1218
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:41,170
My goodness.

1219
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:44,510
No!

1220
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:45,750
Leave me alone!

1221
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:21,980
That's to me.

1222
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:22,780
No, it's not.

1223
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,100
Just kidding.

1224
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,340
Oh my goodness.

1225
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,380
Is that at me?

1226
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:35,290
You missed.

1227
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:36,890
You missed.

1228
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:42,640
Oh no!

1229
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,960
I think I'm the missile type.

1230
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:03,700
Oh my goodness.

1231
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,320
Oh, that's not good.

1232
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:13,450
Be careful!

1233
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:21,230
Wait, am I dying?

1234
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,370
Wait, who is shooting me?

1235
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:31,330
Run!

1236
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:33,950
Run!

1237
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:36,550
Porkyboy, are you OK?

1238
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,390
Are you OK?

1239
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,540
OK, you're fine.

1240
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:09,110
I only have one ration left.

1241
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:09,670
That's so bad.

1242
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:25,130
Give me ration!

1243
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:39,260
Oh come on.

1244
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,200
Why did you have to go that way?

1245
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,060
Are you guys OK over there?

1246
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:45,900
Stay!

1247
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,660
Gratty!

1248
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,460
You guys alright?

1249
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,120
Porkyboy!

1250
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,040
Oh you just all had to match.

1251
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,020
You just all had to match.

1252
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,470
I just got there.

1253
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,090
Going with no.

1254
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,950
Gosh, this guy is tanky.

1255
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:11,830
Like crazy.

1256
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,270
It didn't release.

1257
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:28,190
Why are you guys all dying?

1258
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,440
I hear explosions.

1259
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:40,180
Not

1260
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,220
me please!

1261
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,780
Don't die you guys.

1262
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,640
Oh I haven't reloaded this whole time.

1263
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,100
You son of a gun.

1264
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:19,210
Do I have request strike?

1265
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,550
Actually, I don't.

1266
01:22:23,090 --> 01:22:26,950
I thought I equipped it, but I think I forgot to since I didn't need it the last time.

1267
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:49,010
Nice throw!

1268
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,260
Wait.

1269
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,400
I'm trying to get to her.

1270
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,430
Thank you!

1271
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:00,800
It didn't last very long at all.

1272
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,500
I needed it for the fib, but that's OK.

1273
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,020
Halfway through.

1274
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:27,600
I know.

1275
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,680
Ouchie, ouch, ouch.

1276
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,560
I like how there's supply markers everywhere.

1277
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:37,180
So funny.

1278
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,360
I'm gonna need another one.

1279
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,700
I'm gonna put another one down too.

1280
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:55,810
I don't know why I chose right gear to lay down, but...

1281
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,390
You stinky!

1282
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:09,910
Did you do a smoke grenade so that she wouldn't see me?

1283
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:10,610
That's so funny.

1284
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:11,710
Thank you!

1285
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:17,870
Let's go!

1286
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:23,830
Not at me!

1287
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:25,730
Not at me!

1288
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:27,610
Not at me!

1289
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,530
Where am I?

1290
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:33,290
I'm actually trapped here.

1291
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,290
I ran out of... oh shoot.

1292
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,850
Guys, this is not good.

1293
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,940
Oh my god, I'm trying to leave!

1294
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,200
Guys, this is not good.

1295
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,270
My chat froze, you guys.

1296
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:05,990
I'm so sorry.

1297
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:07,530
Run Pinkie, run!

1298
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:08,150
I'm running!

1299
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,230
I'm running!

1300
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:18,050
I don't think there's really any good use for me to go up there.

1301
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:20,170
Use the ladder!

1302
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:21,950
Okay, guys.

1303
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:28,070
You're up there.

1304
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:28,930
I see you guys.

1305
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:31,190
If you get in, just get in!

1306
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:35,710
Just get the pink and get the...

1307
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,750
If you get anything...

1308
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:50,560
Oh, I dropped it.

1309
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,440
Why did I drop it?

1310
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,100
I'm so stupid.

1311
01:27:59,080 --> 01:27:59,520
Run

1312
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,160
out of supplies.

1313
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,120
We'll have that pre-emptive.

1314
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,080
Alright, good job team!

1315
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,360
Close now.

1316
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:51,800
Yeah!

1317
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,620
So close.

1318
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,060
Sorry I can't re-chat so much because you guys are so small.

1319
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,220
Because it's broken on my YouTube side.

1320
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:03,420
I'll refresh after the fight.

1321
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,120
I'm so sorry.

1322
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,860
This fight is so long.

1323
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,180
RNG again!

1324
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,240
Where are you?

1325
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,160
Someone else get him.

1326
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,040
Wait, where is he?

1327
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,120
Are you up top?

1328
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,520
What did Kota say?

1329
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:42,840
You said he better be capping.

1330
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,660
What does that mean?

1331
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:50,190
I'm coming!

1332
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:51,370
I'll try to get you!

1333
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:58,130
Where the hell is the...

1334
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:01,090
Weapon?

1335
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:01,890
Where are you?

1336
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:03,770
Oh

1337
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,560
my god, I can't get to it.

1338
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,160
I'm gonna punch this thing.

1339
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:18,860
Wait, wait, wait!

1340
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,580
Please let me on the ladder!

1341
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:21,200
Thank you.

1342
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,140
Right chair, are you alive?

1343
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:29,880
Who's up here?

1344
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:32,780
Nobody.

1345
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:44,450
Oh, are you ok Snake?

1346
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,660
I should be able to punch them from here, no?

1347
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,480
Kinda messed up.

1348
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,420
Who's down?

1349
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,840
Where are you?

1350
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:05,380
Snake!

1351
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,320
Snake, where are you?

1352
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,320
I see you.

1353
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,940
Oh, Snake, I'm sorry.

1354
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,260
I'm a little... Snake, I'm sorry.

1355
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:18,240
I'm a little trapped.

1356
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:19,440
I'm coming to get you!

1357
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:23,740
Me first.

1358
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:28,310
I'm coming to get you!

1359
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,690
Wait, which one is mine?

1360
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:10,250
I think mine is over here.

1361
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:14,250
Almost there, so close.

1362
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,500
So close!

1363
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,970
It's too tanky!

1364
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:46,390
Maybe we just redo some of the other, the easier missions instead, because my goodness.

1365
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:51,210
This guy is so tanky.

1366
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,070
Come on Snake, go up.

1367
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:03,150
Everybody!

1368
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,670
Maybe I should have done another.

1369
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,050
Oh my gosh.

1370
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:19,590
Ouch.

1371
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:27,870
Thank you for trying to help.

1372
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:29,990
Me?

1373
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:32,510
No, that's literally you.

1374
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,720
Oh, I'm out of jabs.

1375
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,360
Anyway.

1376
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:53,700
Anyway.

1377
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:02,250
Ouch, I keep taking damage because I'm a stupid man.

1378
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:07,630
Come on guys, we're almost there!

1379
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:10,030
We're almost there!

1380
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:14,190
Oh, I'm done.

1381
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:15,530
Am I?

1382
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:16,410
Oh wait, it's me!

1383
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:17,690
I'm the missile!

1384
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:18,810
Watch out guys, watch out!

1385
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:23,370
Snake, you okay?

1386
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,770
It's almost there!

1387
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,510
It's almost there!

1388
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:33,930
I'm taking damage.

1389
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:35,070
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1390
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:39,590
I thought I was there.

1391
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,180
I don't have anything to break it with.

1392
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,340
Oh wait, I can grenade it.

1393
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,780
Watch out!

1394
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,440
Watch out!

1395
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,840
I can't get in!

1396
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:16,330
Pink and yellow, pink and yellow, pink and yellow, pink and yellow.

1397
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:19,010
C and S.

1398
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:21,750
C and S!

1399
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,410
C and S!

1400
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:26,730
I know, I'm very curious how long that took too.

1401
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:30,730
Gosh, that was long.

1402
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,330
Wow, I'm gonna have to do it again.

1403
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:34,570
It's gonna be even harder!

1404
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:36,630
Oh, S!

1405
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:40,550
C!

1406
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,310
Why doesn't there seem like there's very many?

1407
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:47,350
Oh no, it feels like there's so few.

1408
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:52,090
It feels like there's so few.

1409
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:00,150
That's it?

1410
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:03,830
All of that for this?

1411
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:05,770
No way.

1412
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:08,810
Oh, this is so lame.

1413
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:12,990
That's not a lot at all.

1414
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:15,270
Oh, that sucks so bad.

1415
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:17,390
No way.

1416
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:20,930
We fought for so long, we got scammed!

1417
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:24,890
Because you weren't destroying parts.

1418
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:26,330
What?

1419
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:31,410
No, someone said that I should only focus on the AI pod.

1420
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:37,210
I need to shoot the other parts a lot.

1421
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,480
But did I get one guide?

1422
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,320
You want Metal Gear parts, not AI boards.

1423
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,760
Oh, I get what you mean.

1424
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:56,200
So we want them like... intact.

1425
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:02,420
Wait, I thought the boards were what you use to build it.

1426
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,440
I completely misunderstood the assignment then.

1427
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,000
I see.

1428
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:21,120
So because I attack, maybe the other parts will be intact?

1429
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:24,340
I don't actually understand this part at all.

1430
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:29,240
Oh wait, it doesn't say how long it took.

1431
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,200
What?

1432
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:32,560
No!

1433
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:43,610
There we go!

1434
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,860
You need a railgun from Chrysalis.

1435
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,520
For faster fights, Battlesuit carries three weapons.

1436
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,140
Gustav is the strongest launcher.

1437
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:58,720
Thank you!

1438
01:37:58,860 --> 01:37:59,860
Parts for building Zeke.

1439
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,480
Boards for outer ops.

1440
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,460
I never understood how to build Zeke.

1441
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:11,240
I never understood how to... I was just like, oh I guess I need pink parts.

1442
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,280
Oh my gosh, now I get it.

1443
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,160
I feel stupid.

1444
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:17,140
Oh wow, ok.

1445
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:19,460
So now we should be able to, no?

1446
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,220
Does it matter which one?

1447
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,220
I guess it doesn't matter.

1448
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,260
They look the same.

1449
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:39,860
Head.

1450
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,360
We need the head.

1451
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,300
I have PTSD now.

1452
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,400
We just need the head!

1453
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,260
And then what?

1454
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,940
We need a railgun too, no?

1455
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,160
I have a jetpack.

1456
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,580
All the main parts must be set.

1457
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,800
I have armor.

1458
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,200
I have a railgun!

1459
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,360
You guys, I have it!

1460
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:04,700
I have it!

1461
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,120
I have it!

1462
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:05,520
I have it!

1463
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,020
I have it!

1464
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:06,820
I have a

1465
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:10,890
railgun!

1466
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:11,430
I have a railgun!

1467
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:15,270
So, we just need the head.

1468
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:17,550
We need the head and we will be good.

1469
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:23,170
What is this one?

1470
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:25,150
Oh no, this one.

1471
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:34,130
I got CPR'd by Minto, hell yeah.

1472
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:38,190
Forgot I had one ration.

1473
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:42,270
Oh, the ray dome.

1474
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:43,810
But that's optional.

1475
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:45,350
Okay.

1476
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:50,850
Golly, that was a lot.

1477
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:52,970
I feel like I need a break.

1478
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:57,290
It's already been two hours of mission.

1479
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,250
Sneaky snake, goes dancing.

1480
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,690
So maybe...

1481
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:13,390
To get the head...

1482
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:16,750
Which one would I fight?

1483
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:21,780
I am one leg part away.

1484
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:22,940
You got this!

1485
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,420
You can fight Pewpa.

1486
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,580
Pewpa is not so bad.

1487
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:32,100
So...

1488
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,240
Pewpa, Pewpa, Pewpa.

1489
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:33,720
Okay.

1490
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,140
As long as the head isn't intact, we are not so damaged.

1491
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:38,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1492
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:44,080
Do we want to take a break from the...

1493
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,660
From the AI weapons?

1494
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:48,600
From the not metal gears?

1495
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,360
Tough Scallions, welcome back!

1496
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,120
There I go!

1497
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,660
Time for some monster hunter.

1498
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,160
This one is pretty tough too though.

1499
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,940
This one is pretty, pretty...

1500
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:09,100
But we are still waiting on Zidornov anyway.

1501
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,140
Let's do Pewpa.

1502
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,440
Let's make sure, let's get our...

1503
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,940
Let's get our Zeke ready.

1504
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,400
First off.

1505
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:22,420
This one is not so bad guys, this one is not so bad.

1506
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,040
Yeah, Rathalos is pretty.

1507
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,760
Wow, you guys are so fast!

1508
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,080
Sapphire Eagle.

1509
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,560
Ill-ill-stoppable?

1510
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:36,120
Mobius?

1511
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:37,540
Let's go.

1512
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:43,960
Okay, I love wearing my T-shirt though, but I guess it does make sense to have a third out...

1513
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:44,840
Or third weapon.

1514
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:46,980
Oh no!

1515
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:48,700
No, I'm going with the T.

1516
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:50,480
I'm too lazy.

1517
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:55,920
I'm going with the T.

1518
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:01,520
AI retaliate by spamming your feet with feet.

1519
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:03,360
I don't know what you mean by that.

1520
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:07,860
I don't know what you mean by that.

1521
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:12,020
But I will bring a strike mark.

1522
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,600
This guy is really fast though.

1523
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:18,120
I'd have to like throw it and then like hope that it gets to him.

1524
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,060
Alright, we ready?

1525
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:25,340
Okay, only... Guys, once again, only attack the pod.

1526
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:25,920
Okay?

1527
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,500
Only attack the pod.

1528
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,360
As much as you can, don't attack any other parts.

1529
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:32,740
Only the pod.

1530
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:36,800
We want all the other parts intact.

1531
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,620
Only the pod.

1532
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:39,380
Only the pod.

1533
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,940
Go with the T.

1534
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,300
You got it, boss.

1535
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,940
Yeah, especially not the head.

1536
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,900
Because if we can get two more... We need two more of the head.

1537
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,440
So it's kind of rough.

1538
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:00,310
T for four player battle gear for solo seems fair.

1539
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:00,810
You know what?

1540
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:01,210
That's true.

1541
01:43:02,430 --> 01:43:03,310
That's true.

1542
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:09,270
For future reference for Monster Hunter 7, do you want to go non-lethal or capture on the monsters?

1543
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:11,250
Non-lethal has potential.

1544
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:14,470
I didn't even realize you could go non-lethal.

1545
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:15,430
What?

1546
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:19,950
Really?

1547
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:23,990
I didn't know that.

1548
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:31,090
I think we'll be... Sorry, I can't stop yawning.

1549
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:35,330
I think we'll be here forever though if we go non-lethal.

1550
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:51,960
Amphibious AI.

1551
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:57,070
Infinite banana.

1552
01:43:58,290 --> 01:43:59,270
Sleep grenade.

1553
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:01,390
I see.

1554
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:08,590
We'll see.

1555
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:11,510
Let's get this first.

1556
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:17,230
Only the pod!

1557
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:17,870
Only the pod!

1558
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:18,570
Only the pod!

1559
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:25,570
He's so fast.

1560
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:30,450
Stop being so fast.

1561
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:33,330
The

1562
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,020
head is going to get damaged.

1563
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,020
Let's not have my lime soda.

1564
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:54,920
I'm going to change.

1565
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:10,210
Stop moving.

1566
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:25,420
I tried to time it and I was a fool.

1567
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,240
We'll just wait until this.

1568
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,280
Nice save.

1569
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:37,860
I think chaff will come in handy here.

1570
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,800
Good thing I didn't shoot.

1571
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:46,560
Not straight.

1572
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:47,100
Just kidding.

1573
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:47,900
This is fine.

1574
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:16,700
At least, like I said, this one is so much faster.

1575
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:19,560
We're already making pretty good progress.

1576
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:25,940
It's just a little bit slower because we have to...

1577
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:32,150
Wait, can I get down for this one?

1578
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:42,850
That's what I was about to do.

1579
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:43,730
No!

1580
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:46,990
Shoot.

1581
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:05,470
She's so cute.

1582
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:07,610
Here

1583
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:14,860
comes the Joker!

1584
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,140
She moves around.

1585
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:19,020
She's so nimble.

1586
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:22,460
She's so nimble.

1587
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,040
She's so nimble.

1588
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:37,480
How did you get hit?

1589
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:38,800
So funny.

1590
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,840
I hate.

1591
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,520
I miss the thing that didn't move.

1592
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,920
I miss the one that didn't move.

1593
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,220
I miss it.

1594
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,180
I miss it.

1595
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,620
This one moves too much.

1596
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:35,120
Where is your target locking?

1597
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,520
Not me!

1598
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,330
We're almost there!

1599
01:48:57,450 --> 01:48:58,170
I died.

1600
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:00,370
Oops, I guess I died.

1601
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:02,530
Oops, I guess I died.

1602
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:05,130
Does anyone want to do it?

1603
01:49:05,570 --> 01:49:05,870
No?

1604
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:06,670
I'll do it.

1605
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:08,330
Anybody?

1606
01:49:08,830 --> 01:49:09,070
No?

1607
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,590
OK.

1608
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:12,990
That was so fast.

1609
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:23,670
I'm glad.

1610
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,970
I should have done more of this off stream I feel.

1611
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:29,170
Or like in the member stream that I did.

1612
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:33,310
Because it's so grindy at the end of this game.

1613
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:35,930
That's just how it goes.

1614
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:38,230
We're close.

1615
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:39,330
We're almost there guys.

1616
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:45,030
Don't attack the outside.

1617
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:47,350
Just chill you guys.

1618
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:49,790
You can just chill.

1619
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:51,430
Hi Minda.

1620
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:52,190
Hi Brandon.

1621
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:53,270
Thank you.

1622
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:55,910
Just chill out there.

1623
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:56,550
Don't attack.

1624
01:49:56,610 --> 01:49:57,130
You're fine.

1625
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,990
It's fun grinding with Minda.

1626
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:06,130
The member stream was already pretty long.

1627
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:06,510
I know!

1628
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:11,290
We already did a bunch of...

1629
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,810
A bunch of progress in that.

1630
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,920
OK, let's go baby.

1631
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:52,980
Oh, version of Peace Walker?

1632
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:54,400
This is the Xbox version.

1633
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,180
Yes, yes, yes.

1634
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:08,670
Please, please, two head.

1635
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,050
Please, please, two head.

1636
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:12,690
Please, please, two head.

1637
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:14,230
Please, please, two head.

1638
01:51:14,390 --> 01:51:16,690
Please, please, two head.

1639
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:18,910
Please, please, two head.

1640
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,550
Please, please.

1641
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:23,910
Two head.

1642
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:27,030
Please, please, two head.

1643
01:51:27,110 --> 01:51:27,730
Please, please.

1644
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:29,890
Please head and please make it two.

1645
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:33,290
Scared.

1646
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:00,230
Mother base.

1647
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:06,790
So now our...

1648
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:08,630
Metal gear...

1649
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:11,450
Is primed and ready.

1650
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:12,270
I think.

1651
01:52:12,270 --> 01:52:14,210
Alright, let's double check.

1652
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:16,690
I'm scared.

1653
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:18,210
Snake our head, let's go!

1654
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:19,910
Let's go!

1655
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:22,170
That was it, right?

1656
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,860
We need one more head.

1657
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,300
We need one more head.

1658
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:38,480
Two head.

1659
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:49,430
I thought it was going to be no head.

1660
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:59,470
Yeah, well we have to do it again anyway because the doorknob is...

1661
01:52:59,470 --> 01:53:00,550
Still around.

1662
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:05,250
So yeah, we'll just do Pupa again.

1663
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:06,730
You need a railgun too.

1664
01:53:06,810 --> 01:53:07,450
I have railgun.

1665
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:08,530
I already checked earlier.

1666
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:10,990
OK.

1667
01:53:14,650 --> 01:53:16,050
Let's do it again.

1668
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:19,370
Let's do it again.

1669
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,930
And then we're going to do it another time.

1670
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:25,890
All this for a stinking date.

1671
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:29,890
Welcome to Kato!

1672
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:30,670
Welcome to Arby!

1673
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:31,750
Welcome to Silver!

1674
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:35,390
Let's go.

1675
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:39,650
Do story Pupa.

1676
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:41,330
Actually, you know what?

1677
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:42,150
I thought about that.

1678
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,050
It's fine though.

1679
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:49,200
Or maybe we should switch.

1680
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:49,980
I don't know.

1681
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:56,230
It's all good.

1682
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:56,890
It's all good.

1683
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:02,510
Murphy, you good?

1684
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:05,050
You didn't ready up.

1685
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:07,530
And we're starting the mission.

1686
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:08,170
Are you OK?

1687
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:10,130
Are you OK?

1688
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:13,670
Yeah?

1689
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:14,590
OK.

1690
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:17,250
Dang it.

1691
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:19,310
Yeah, it wasn't that long of a mission at all.

1692
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:25,610
Because I had gear.

1693
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:28,150
Your gear.

1694
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:30,290
Your metal gear.

1695
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,450
Strange love.

1696
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:40,150
She's so beautiful.

1697
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,520
Snake has such long eyelashes.

1698
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,260
They're so pretty.

1699
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:57,610
And then if the doorknob is not...

1700
01:54:58,810 --> 01:54:59,970
Gone by now.

1701
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:02,810
After this fight we will do Rathalos.

1702
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:07,010
Craving some lime soda.

1703
01:55:09,610 --> 01:55:10,770
Let's go Pupa!

1704
01:55:10,990 --> 01:55:11,750
One more time.

1705
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:14,010
Just do the pod you guys.

1706
01:55:14,110 --> 01:55:15,090
Just aim for the pod.

1707
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:15,950
Aim for the pod.

1708
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:22,070
Oh wait.

1709
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:22,630
My bad.

1710
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:23,110
Oh wait.

1711
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:23,470
My bad.

1712
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:24,850
There we go.

1713
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:27,250
Go!

1714
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:27,430
Go!

1715
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:27,710
Go!

1716
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:31,490
OK!

1717
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:32,470
Go!

1718
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:32,630
Go!

1719
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:32,910
Go!

1720
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:34,250
Go!

1721
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:34,530
Go!

1722
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:37,270
Go!

1723
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:37,370
Go!

1724
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:38,390
Go!

1725
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:44,530
Go!

1726
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,860
Good job team!

1727
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:06,840
Good job team!

1728
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:12,980
Good job, team.

1729
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:14,140
Good job, team.

1730
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:22,840
I'm gonna go up here.

1731
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,520
What is this supposed to be?

1732
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:27,740
It's...

1733
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:29,180
Very much like a...

1734
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,080
It's a stadium.

1735
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:33,560
No, it's not a stadium.

1736
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,520
Feels like one.

1737
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,720
That was almost a really good dodge.

1738
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:58,780
You'll just think I will always draw a snake with the most gorgeous lashes.

1739
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,240
I know!

1740
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,280
Where do you think she's at?

1741
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,660
There she is!

1742
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:08,140
Oh my gosh, making...

1743
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:10,340
Her debut on the stage!

1744
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:15,560
Oh, ouch!

1745
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:16,600
Wait, help me!

1746
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,060
Why me?

1747
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,320
Hey, why me?

1748
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:20,440
Why me?

1749
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:24,360
Ouch!

1750
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:26,960
Stop it!

1751
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:48,070
Please, please!

1752
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:48,870
Supply!

1753
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:50,390
Supply!

1754
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:51,510
There we go.

1755
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:51,930
Thank you.

1756
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:55,750
Sometimes my...

1757
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:58,850
That was so close.

1758
01:57:59,050 --> 01:57:59,630
Oh my gosh.

1759
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:01,870
Sometimes the... What's it called?

1760
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:03,750
I think my controller is a little borked.

1761
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:04,270
What?

1762
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:08,730
Oh, the chap blocked the radio.

1763
01:58:08,910 --> 01:58:09,090
Oh.

1764
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:11,190
Then you're right.

1765
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:14,970
I didn't even think about it.

1766
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:15,770
Wow!

1767
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:17,050
Ouchie.

1768
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:20,550
Chap, I didn't even think about it.

1769
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:21,110
Oh god.

1770
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:24,550
Today, you guys, I had to go outside.

1771
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:28,970
Wait, that's me?

1772
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:32,490
Oh, no it's...

1773
01:58:32,490 --> 01:58:34,850
Are you... Are you down?

1774
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:40,790
I watched that happen.

1775
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:42,910
I had to go outside.

1776
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:44,670
I mean, like, outside, outside.

1777
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:47,650
So, like, I had to take some allergy medicine.

1778
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:49,350
I'm a little drowsy from it.

1779
01:58:58,150 --> 01:58:59,730
Are you still alive?

1780
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:00,410
I'm not.

1781
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:01,410
I'm dead, actually.

1782
01:59:02,350 --> 01:59:02,970
Oh, hello?

1783
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:06,410
I'm actually... I'm actually a ghost.

1784
01:59:13,770 --> 01:59:15,590
I think pupa is so cute.

1785
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,610
Is this the one you lay down for?

1786
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:02,150
Okay, guys, come on.

1787
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:02,730
Come on.

1788
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:13,840
Oh, my rations.

1789
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:15,460
How did I run out?

1790
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:35,480
I was like, yeah, I was like, what's making me so drowsy today?

1791
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,880
I forgot that I took the medicine.

1792
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,920
And I didn't have...

1793
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,880
Anything other than the regular, you know.

1794
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:11,740
Non-non-drowsy.

1795
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,000
I never get aimed for in the...

1796
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,920
Oh, my gosh, my health is so bad.

1797
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:20,380
Ouch.

1798
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:21,920
Wait, who's down?

1799
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:22,800
Oh.

1800
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:23,540
Perfect.

1801
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:29,120
Does anyone have a rescue box?

1802
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:31,180
Yeah, we can hear the wee-woo.

1803
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:32,680
Wee-woo.

1804
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:33,640
That's what that is.

1805
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:34,220
There it is.

1806
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,140
The kid has got it.

1807
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,100
Wait, can I get in?

1808
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,300
Can I get in?

1809
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:41,890
Oh.

1810
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:46,370
Oh, it won't let me in.

1811
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:47,290
No!

1812
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:49,490
Oh, there it is.

1813
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:52,890
Okay, just kidding.

1814
02:01:54,030 --> 02:01:55,510
I guess I didn't want to be in there for that long.

1815
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:57,670
Yeah!

1816
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,460
Wee-woo.

1817
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,000
My health's not going up, though.

1818
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,200
Okay.

1819
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:14,020
Oh.

1820
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:17,140
Wow, and we lost health.

1821
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:18,100
Wow.

1822
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:19,000
Okay, that's not good.

1823
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,440
That was actually anti-productive.

1824
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:24,720
Okay, let's actually beat this thing.

1825
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,620
I'm tired of fighting them.

1826
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:34,880
We're not very far in.

1827
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:40,570
My curry!

1828
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:42,510
How have I lost everything?

1829
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:47,090
Oh, okay.

1830
02:02:47,170 --> 02:02:48,310
I was like...

1831
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:58,850
This run is a little less unsmooth than the prior.

1832
02:02:58,950 --> 02:02:59,250
Yeah!

1833
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:00,310
Is everyone attacking?

1834
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:02,930
Is everyone doing their part?

1835
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:05,830
I feel like.

1836
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,130
Maybe.

1837
02:03:08,370 --> 02:03:11,930
Some people aren't attacking as strong as they should be.

1838
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:16,690
Nobody forgot their weapons, huh?

1839
02:03:16,990 --> 02:03:17,830
Oh my gosh, again?

1840
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:22,110
Oh, that was close.

1841
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:26,250
I'm doing my part.

1842
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:33,920
I don't think so.

1843
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:43,180
Maybe I should have just done the story version.

1844
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:43,820
I should have...

1845
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:55,600
Guys!

1846
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:58,900
Guys, I'm so asleep.

1847
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:00,460
These fights are making me so sleepy.

1848
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:05,280
At least, I think the other one was so long it made me so tired.

1849
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,440
It was so boring.

1850
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:15,200
No, I mean by the last one, not like the last fight.

1851
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,500
That one guy.

1852
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:39,010
Supply.

1853
02:04:48,850 --> 02:04:50,010
Wait, is that mine?

1854
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:53,470
That's not mine.

1855
02:04:55,090 --> 02:04:55,410
Wait.

1856
02:04:56,990 --> 02:04:57,590
It

1857
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:02,980
is?

1858
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:03,840
But it's the yellow.

1859
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,080
What is this one then?

1860
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:07,860
What is that?

1861
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,340
I tossed one early.

1862
02:05:13,940 --> 02:05:15,860
I forgot about it.

1863
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,100
This is mine too.

1864
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:25,080
Where are you, little lady?

1865
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:28,660
Oh my gosh.

1866
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:29,320
Oh my goodness.

1867
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,120
The exact same place too.

1868
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:36,860
I know, I'm so consistent.

1869
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:40,980
We're almost there, guys!

1870
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:44,200
Keep going.

1871
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:16,330
I didn't realize I was not reloaded.

1872
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:19,510
That's pretty bad.

1873
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:23,510
Just four more rounds of shots.

1874
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:24,370
I sure hope so.

1875
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:28,070
As long as we don't miss.

1876
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:31,610
And by we, I mean me.

1877
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:58,450
I mean...

1878
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:02,250
Oh no, Chiquito.

1879
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,130
I mean...

1880
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:10,910
I went the wrong way.

1881
02:07:12,070 --> 02:07:14,630
She was aiming for right here, no?

1882
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:26,580
Rolled right into it.

1883
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:26,940
I know.

1884
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,900
So stinking cute.

1885
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:40,460
Please,

1886
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:47,080
thank you!

1887
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:00,880
Almost there.

1888
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,200
Almost there.

1889
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:05,740
I'm excited for the final battle though.

1890
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:15,180
I just gotta keep the eye on the prize, everybody.

1891
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:18,120
We gotta remember why we're doing all of this.

1892
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,840
We have to remember why we're going through this struggle.

1893
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:25,480
Eye on the prize!

1894
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:26,380
Eye on the prize!

1895
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:28,120
Peace.

1896
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:33,120
Hell yeah, peace.

1897
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:36,920
Peace day!

1898
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,160
Oh boy.

1899
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:43,360
I still shot it though.

1900
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:49,370
Oh, I'm shot!

1901
02:08:51,810 --> 02:08:52,950
Wake up, snake!

1902
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:53,350
Wake up!

1903
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:54,090
Snake!

1904
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:55,070
Snake, wake up!

1905
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:56,630
Wake up!

1906
02:08:57,670 --> 02:08:58,150
I'm trying!

1907
02:08:58,830 --> 02:08:59,670
Wake me up!

1908
02:09:00,350 --> 02:09:01,130
Wake up!

1909
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:02,090
Thanks, Chiquito.

1910
02:09:04,610 --> 02:09:07,030
You did have to pat my ass though.

1911
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:10,210
Actually, apparently you did.

1912
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:13,310
Actually, you know what?

1913
02:09:13,310 --> 02:09:13,830
I said that.

1914
02:09:13,890 --> 02:09:15,850
But apparently you did have to pat my ass.

1915
02:09:19,930 --> 02:09:23,410
Look how cute it is.

1916
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:36,600
We're almost there!

1917
02:09:38,540 --> 02:09:40,080
We're almost there.

1918
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:52,260
We're so close, you guys!

1919
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:52,820
Please!

1920
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:55,120
Just keep fighting!

1921
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:55,820
Please!

1922
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:01,540
Silver, you doing okay over... Ouch!

1923
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:03,000
You doing okay over here?

1924
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:06,140
Am I out of...

1925
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:07,340
Well, luckily I have rations.

1926
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:08,680
And

1927
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:15,000
now, I supply my...

1928
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:24,520
What are you joking about not being able to dive into a crowd during a live performance?

1929
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:27,260
I can see you doing something like Pupa here.

1930
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:28,580
I would love to, yeah.

1931
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:30,940
Oh, let me get my stuff.

1932
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:31,900
Wait, what is this?

1933
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,160
Oh, okay.

1934
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,180
Some courage.

1935
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:47,620
Just a little bit more!

1936
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:51,520
Just a little bit more!

1937
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:05,870
Why does this feel like ten times longer than the previous one?

1938
02:11:07,290 --> 02:11:08,170
Sorry, guys.

1939
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:09,750
Maybe the other team was better.

1940
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:20,460
She

1941
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:33,230
doesn't stop boosting.

1942
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:45,420
Maybe people aren't getting clear enough shots in the pod.

1943
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:45,900
Maybe.

1944
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,250
Here she comes!

1945
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:54,050
Oh my goodness.

1946
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:56,550
Right in front of me.

1947
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:57,790
Oh, ouch.

1948
02:11:59,730 --> 02:12:01,550
Her ass is so fat.

1949
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:04,010
Not a bad thing.

1950
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:04,890
Positive.

1951
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:06,250
Not complaining.

1952
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:10,790
Oh my god, I shot too soon.

1953
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:32,780
I shoot too soon all the time, too.

1954
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:34,500
It happens.

1955
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:36,580
I hear her.

1956
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:38,500
I like hearing her when she runs away, though.

1957
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:39,440
She's so happy.

1958
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:41,780
She's just a little singing girl.

1959
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:44,500
You think anyone's up in there?

1960
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:46,060
Oh my god.

1961
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:46,880
Oh my god.

1962
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:50,940
This is like her big ol' swimming pool.

1963
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,780
We're almost there, you guys!

1964
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:56,200
Please!

1965
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:56,280
Please!

1966
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:17,300
Finally!

1967
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:20,540
Goodness gracious.

1968
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:27,820
Alright, we just need a head, baby.

1969
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,040
We just need the head.

1970
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:34,180
We just need the head!

1971
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:57,970
We destroyed it thoroughly.

1972
02:13:58,290 --> 02:13:59,670
There's like barely anything here.

1973
02:14:03,390 --> 02:14:04,970
She's all beat up.

1974
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:06,130
She's stupid now.

1975
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:08,370
Brain damage.

1976
02:14:09,470 --> 02:14:10,250
Brain damage!

1977
02:14:22,490 --> 02:14:25,930
I feel like Zadornov is going to be gone after this.

1978
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:30,210
Chill.

1979
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,890
Alright.

1980
02:14:32,990 --> 02:14:33,950
Brain damage.

1981
02:14:34,150 --> 02:14:34,810
Brain damage.

1982
02:14:34,930 --> 02:14:35,530
Brain damage.

1983
02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:41,700
Wanna bet?

1984
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:42,740
Yeah, let's bet.

1985
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:43,400
Five bucks.

1986
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:48,540
I bet five bucks that Zadornov will be having it...

1987
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:56,080
I bet you five bucks Zadornov will be... Oh gosh, maybe I got the brain damage.

1988
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:58,820
Waiting for Mint to finally get a head.

1989
02:14:58,820 --> 02:15:01,740
Well, I had two before.

1990
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:24,050
To be honest guys, I'm not looking forward to fighting this thing for the third time.

1991
02:15:25,790 --> 02:15:27,590
I'm not looking forward to it.

1992
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:35,260
I'm scared.

1993
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:46,390
And there we have it folks!

1994
02:15:50,230 --> 02:15:52,950
Murphy, nobody needs to know what happened outside.

1995
02:16:01,210 --> 02:16:02,490
Thanks Huey!

1996
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:08,650
Why drop stuff giving me no rockets?

1997
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:09,170
Oh.

1998
02:16:10,590 --> 02:16:11,490
That's weird.

1999
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:26,470
Oh.

2000
02:16:29,870 --> 02:16:30,630
Oh.

2001
02:16:32,230 --> 02:16:32,450
Oh.

2002
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:34,110
I'm reading Headless Zeke to Headed Zeke.

2003
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:35,410
Thank you.

2004
02:16:42,830 --> 02:16:47,830
Right, that's why we...

2005
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:49,290
That's why we...

2006
02:16:49,290 --> 02:16:50,810
It's okay.

2007
02:16:55,590 --> 02:16:56,990
Uh.

2008
02:17:05,490 --> 02:17:05,890
Fine.

2009
02:17:08,270 --> 02:17:18,270
Thank you so much!

2010
02:17:19,290 --> 02:17:21,810
Thanks for joining!

2011
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:34,670
Ah, okay yeah.

2012
02:17:45,510 --> 02:17:45,830
Uh oh.

2013
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:46,030
Uh.

2014
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:51,830
Cause we have an entire main story explaining why that doesn't work.

2015
02:17:51,990 --> 02:17:52,770
I know!

2016
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:54,310
Oh.

2017
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:57,710
Okay, do I owe you guys 5 bucks or...

2018
02:17:59,810 --> 02:18:00,650
Uh oh.

2019
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:02,350
Oh no!

2020
02:18:03,730 --> 02:18:05,370
Boss loading nuke on Metal Gear?

2021
02:18:12,710 --> 02:18:13,910
Aw man.

2022
02:18:13,910 --> 02:18:16,910
Is there anything else in R&D we can get?

2023
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:17,270
No?

2024
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:24,530
Are you guys ready to color her?

2025
02:18:26,110 --> 02:18:27,110
Paint color!

2026
02:18:31,150 --> 02:18:32,150
Sage green.

2027
02:18:34,630 --> 02:18:36,350
No, I like the sage green.

2028
02:18:36,470 --> 02:18:37,090
I think it's better.

2029
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:43,770
And...

2030
02:18:44,390 --> 02:18:45,690
It's kinda like...

2031
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:46,470
Wait.

2032
02:18:46,930 --> 02:18:49,330
I feel like the turquoise is too dark, no?

2033
02:18:50,330 --> 02:18:52,830
Just got off a 13 hour shift!

2034
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:54,030
Oh my gosh.

2035
02:18:54,470 --> 02:18:55,710
Tom Otsu!

2036
02:18:56,430 --> 02:19:00,170
I love how Kaz talks about a nuclear warhead like it's a puppy who followed him on ice.

2037
02:19:01,410 --> 02:19:04,270
Oh Kaz, he's just a guy.

2038
02:19:05,970 --> 02:19:06,610
Maybe white?

2039
02:19:08,450 --> 02:19:11,070
How did the 5 bucks you gave us just bounce back?

2040
02:19:11,130 --> 02:19:11,350
No!

2041
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:18,300
The brown works too.

2042
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,580
Wait, is there maybe a blue?

2043
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,480
Who's determining these colors?

2044
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:44,000
There we go.

2045
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:46,120
Yay!

2046
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:47,600
It's Sieg!

2047
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:50,100
Metal Gear Sieg!

2048
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,340
Oh wait, does she have the...

2049
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:56,280
Oh, launch Sieg!

2050
02:19:56,400 --> 02:19:57,760
No, I did not do that.

2051
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:00,380
No, I didn't.

2052
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:09,820
Surely this will not backfire on us.

2053
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:13,700
Look at the railgun.

2054
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:14,540
Look at it there.

2055
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:19,300
Sieg is so cute.

2056
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:24,240
I always think of the little orb as a tiny, tiny head.

2057
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:27,300
Any more optional parts?

2058
02:20:27,540 --> 02:20:29,680
Just this, but I don't have it.

2059
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,580
With the ray dome.

2060
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:33,160
I do not have a ray dome.

2061
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:36,100
But that's okay, we completed Sieg.

2062
02:20:37,180 --> 02:20:39,400
Good job everybody, good job!

2063
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:40,540
Good job, good job.

2064
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:43,060
Shall we go do Rathalos?

2065
02:20:44,980 --> 02:20:45,460
Since...

2066
02:20:47,740 --> 02:20:49,400
The doorknob is...

2067
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:54,820
Alright guys.

2068
02:20:58,220 --> 02:20:59,320
How do you get the ray dome?

2069
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:00,620
I don't know actually.

2070
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:04,380
You can fight main story chrysalis to get the ray dome.

2071
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:05,840
I see, I see, I see.

2072
02:21:20,300 --> 02:21:24,540
This one is a little tough guys.

2073
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:27,900
Oh, rocks!

2074
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:35,060
Clanky!

2075
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,300
Welcome everybody.

2076
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:38,880
Alright, I'm gonna actually...

2077
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:39,340
Wait.

2078
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:42,740
For this, I will use the battle.

2079
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:45,060
This one I feel... I'm scared.

2080
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:47,720
Wait, what's this one?

2081
02:21:48,660 --> 02:21:50,080
Oh, maybe I should do this instead.

2082
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:52,520
Are better rations.

2083
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:56,020
And we'll go with the good curry.

2084
02:21:57,620 --> 02:21:58,960
The super curry.

2085
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:00,400
Spicy curry.

2086
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:03,480
We'll get some tortilla chips.

2087
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,700
We'll get...

2088
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:09,500
Shield?

2089
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:13,220
Not going with the T.

2090
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:14,700
I know I'm losing my...

2091
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:17,700
I'm losing my...

2092
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:35,900
That should be fine though.

2093
02:22:39,820 --> 02:22:40,340
Gustav?

2094
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:47,680
Zlaniga?

2095
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:48,520
Wait.

2096
02:22:50,140 --> 02:22:50,740
Let's do Fem.

2097
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:54,080
Folks wanna know lethal or non-lethal.

2098
02:22:54,140 --> 02:22:55,480
Oh, let's do... We'll do lethal.

2099
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:56,260
We'll do lethal.

2100
02:22:57,700 --> 02:22:58,540
It's okay.

2101
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,100
It's okay.

2102
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:01,860
I...

2103
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:04,440
I don't know why I'm so tired.

2104
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:07,280
I'm getting like...

2105
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:10,880
I'm getting all...

2106
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:15,220
Supply.

2107
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:15,740
Strike.

2108
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:18,020
Grenade.

2109
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:21,060
Should be good.

2110
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:23,160
Grinding does it too.

2111
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:23,940
I think so too.

2112
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:25,880
I'm like so... But I...

2113
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:27,840
Even before stream, I took a nap.

2114
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:29,900
I was so like...

2115
02:23:29,900 --> 02:23:31,980
So sleepy.

2116
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,660
Oh, wait.

2117
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:35,080
I just realized my curry.

2118
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:37,440
What's the F curry?

2119
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:38,580
Future curry.

2120
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:39,240
That's right.

2121
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:43,840
I wish I would sort it by like...

2122
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:44,940
Best up top.

2123
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,600
You know what I mean?

2124
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:49,020
Okay.

2125
02:23:58,470 --> 02:23:58,930
Should be good.

2126
02:24:01,650 --> 02:24:02,570
Are we ready, team?

2127
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:05,890
Soda is... Oh, is this soda?

2128
02:24:06,230 --> 02:24:08,370
It says psyche, but I always...

2129
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:10,130
Never use it.

2130
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:10,990
I never think about it.

2131
02:24:12,090 --> 02:24:12,530
Alright.

2132
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:13,490
Let's go!

2133
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:24,310
I don't want to have more coffee today.

2134
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:25,750
Because I already had coffee today.

2135
02:24:26,890 --> 02:24:27,890
Sorry, guys.

2136
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:28,590
I'm so sleepy.

2137
02:24:30,790 --> 02:24:31,230
Rathalos!

2138
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:37,830
Don't forget to cook rations here, folks.

2139
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:44,240
Oh my god!

2140
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:45,580
Jesus Christ.

2141
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:47,320
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

2142
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:48,600
You are forgiven.

2143
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:50,920
Good luck hunting, boss.

2144
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:52,540
You hear it?

2145
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,540
You hear it?

2146
02:25:02,250 --> 02:25:03,350
Gonna have a bit of black tea.

2147
02:25:03,410 --> 02:25:04,870
That's actually what I'm drinking right now.

2148
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:05,530
Some tea.

2149
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:07,450
Well, it's not black tea, but...

2150
02:25:07,450 --> 02:25:08,490
It is like a green tea.

2151
02:25:14,350 --> 02:25:15,910
That's how you say keep you waiting.

2152
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:17,410
Or kept you waiting.

2153
02:25:18,190 --> 02:25:18,990
In cat.

2154
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:26,120
Monster hunter time, baby.

2155
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:32,300
Meow, meow.

2156
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:38,380
Let's go, team.

2157
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:40,740
Are you sure it isn't meow, meow, meow?

2158
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:41,840
I don't think so.

2159
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:43,620
Oh my god.

2160
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:44,420
Kept you waiting, huh?

2161
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:45,780
Pig!

2162
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:47,380
Going with the tea.

2163
02:25:54,020 --> 02:25:55,120
Oh, boss runner.

2164
02:25:58,260 --> 02:25:59,020
So cute.

2165
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:07,370
It's so weird seeing this in Metal Gear.

2166
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:24,940
Rathalos!

2167
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,800
King of the skies!

2168
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:29,080
Let's go!

2169
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:31,960
Goal!

2170
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:44,190
Ah.

2171
02:26:44,790 --> 02:26:45,290
Ah.

2172
02:26:46,050 --> 02:26:46,550
Ah.

2173
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:47,970
Ah.

2174
02:26:54,150 --> 02:26:54,750
Ah.

2175
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:03,320
Oh my god.

2176
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:07,160
Watch out!

2177
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:11,520
Oh my gosh.

2178
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:13,060
I forgot he does fireballs.

2179
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:16,240
No, leave me alone!

2180
02:27:20,420 --> 02:27:21,020
It's

2181
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:24,600
okay.

2182
02:27:24,860 --> 02:27:25,260
Oh my gosh.

2183
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:30,040
Oh my god.

2184
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:32,460
Oh!

2185
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,980
Meow, meow.

2186
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,020
Not the wind getting me.

2187
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:41,960
Come on!

2188
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:43,160
Nice shot.

2189
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:43,660
Thank you.

2190
02:27:52,490 --> 02:27:53,010
Rooks!

2191
02:27:53,890 --> 02:27:55,210
Don't die on me!

2192
02:27:56,490 --> 02:27:57,270
Oh my god.

2193
02:27:57,390 --> 02:27:57,770
Oh my god.

2194
02:27:58,050 --> 02:27:58,270
Oh.

2195
02:27:58,830 --> 02:27:59,370
Oh, game.

2196
02:28:00,090 --> 02:28:00,750
Game, gun buddy!

2197
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:02,410
Game, gun buddy!

2198
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:03,470
Oh god.

2199
02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:03,950
Oh god.

2200
02:28:04,530 --> 02:28:05,330
Game, gun buddy!

2201
02:28:05,330 --> 02:28:05,450
Game, gun buddy!

2202
02:28:06,330 --> 02:28:07,830
I think I missed.

2203
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:17,000
Nice!

2204
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:19,100
Shot him down.

2205
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:24,950
I'm gonna cook my rations.

2206
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:30,990
I'm the one getting cooked!

2207
02:28:35,970 --> 02:28:36,510
Okay.

2208
02:28:38,470 --> 02:28:39,390
Nice.

2209
02:28:39,910 --> 02:28:40,690
Good job team!

2210
02:28:40,690 --> 02:28:40,810
Damn!

2211
02:28:43,890 --> 02:28:44,970
Oh, ouchie ouchie.

2212
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:45,770
Oh my goodness.

2213
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:47,730
Everybody, we're okay, right?

2214
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:55,840
Where is he?

2215
02:28:55,940 --> 02:28:56,420
Oh, there he is.

2216
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:01,500
Hey, chill out!

2217
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:03,740
Little jerk.

2218
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,780
Wait, where'd that guy go?

2219
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,060
Where's the guy that took me out?

2220
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:11,600
Where is he?

2221
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:18,310
Do you think I'll be able to get him from here?

2222
02:29:18,810 --> 02:29:20,110
Let's test it.

2223
02:29:21,550 --> 02:29:21,990
Oh!

2224
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:23,250
I was!

2225
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:24,870
Pretty good.

2226
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:37,650
I got you!

2227
02:29:37,650 --> 02:29:37,730
Oh!

2228
02:29:46,910 --> 02:29:48,450
Don't you die on me!

2229
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:58,750
Are you just spamming that or is it one of those guys who says that every time you take a shot?

2230
02:30:00,030 --> 02:30:00,470
What?

2231
02:30:09,270 --> 02:30:09,710
Yummy!

2232
02:30:14,830 --> 02:30:15,270
Yummy!

2233
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:21,850
I knew you had it in you.

2234
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:23,110
I think it's glitched.

2235
02:30:23,110 --> 02:30:23,530
It's okay!

2236
02:30:24,810 --> 02:30:26,730
Oh my god, I think it really is glitched.

2237
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:30,550
I think it's glitched.

2238
02:30:30,550 --> 02:30:31,190
I think it's glitched for real.

2239
02:30:36,290 --> 02:30:38,090
I knew you had it in you.

2240
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:42,310
Where is he?

2241
02:30:42,410 --> 02:30:43,630
What am I gonna do?

2242
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:50,870
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll get out.

2243
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:01,380
Oops.

2244
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:05,560
Nice.

2245
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:07,320
That looks delicious.

2246
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:09,100
Sorry.

2247
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:25,920
Oh, I have a lot of stuff.

2248
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:27,800
Claymore?

2249
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:28,940
Why did you give me this?

2250
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:36,440
Cooking rashes instead of fire...

2251
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:37,200
Ouch!

2252
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:40,600
Leave me alone!

2253
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:44,300
It's kind of hard right now though.

2254
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:46,140
Because he is flying around.

2255
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:47,520
Ew!

2256
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:49,500
He is flying around.

2257
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:51,140
Where did he go?

2258
02:31:53,420 --> 02:31:54,340
I got him.

2259
02:31:58,260 --> 02:31:59,500
And it missed.

2260
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:00,840
That's so sad.

2261
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:05,180
Nice hit!

2262
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:06,000
That's me!

2263
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,220
I tried to dodge.

2264
02:32:23,480 --> 02:32:25,080
Good job, team!

2265
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:27,880
Good job, team!

2266
02:32:30,300 --> 02:32:31,500
Or not.

2267
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:32,720
What are you guys doing over there?

2268
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:35,540
Come on!

2269
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:36,300
Quit it!

2270
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:37,460
Quit messing around!

2271
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:52,690
Where did he go?

2272
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:03,040
Please!

2273
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:03,140
Please!

2274
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:08,380
Wait, we can go fishing too!

2275
02:33:17,890 --> 02:33:18,750
Flash vomit?

2276
02:33:18,890 --> 02:33:19,450
I didn't bring that.

2277
02:33:20,590 --> 02:33:21,230
I didn't bring it.

2278
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:32,340
I keep moving too fast.

2279
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:37,240
Why are you guys getting hit?

2280
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:39,280
Quit messing around!

2281
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:41,520
Nice.

2282
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:44,100
Quit messing around!

2283
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,940
These fights are so hard to play solo.

2284
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,060
Yeah, I believe it.

2285
02:34:02,900 --> 02:34:03,480
That's me.

2286
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:09,480
Get up!

2287
02:34:11,420 --> 02:34:12,300
I'm trapped!

2288
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:16,660
How did I live?

2289
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:17,800
Or how did I make it?

2290
02:34:17,860 --> 02:34:18,620
I don't have anymore.

2291
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:23,540
I'm completely out of supply.

2292
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:32,750
This will be my area.

2293
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:34,710
Like that.

2294
02:34:36,930 --> 02:34:38,110
Wait, what is this?

2295
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:40,510
RPG?

2296
02:34:41,210 --> 02:34:41,630
Oh, okay.

2297
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:46,540
Is he back in the air?

2298
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:46,820
Okay.

2299
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:49,480
My hidey hole.

2300
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:52,240
Oh golly!

2301
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,440
Whatever he does, it's an attack fight!

2302
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:00,800
The game says no thank you!

2303
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:04,220
The game says no thanks!

2304
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:05,640
Oh my gosh, poor Palico.

2305
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,660
He's king of the skies.

2306
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:17,420
Yeah, but...

2307
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:19,200
I don't know.

2308
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:22,940
I just thought he might be tired.

2309
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:23,140
Sorry.

2310
02:35:26,480 --> 02:35:27,600
Can I get up please?

2311
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:45,150
I got me in the butt!

2312
02:35:52,970 --> 02:35:53,730
Look at...

2313
02:35:53,730 --> 02:35:55,630
He's so fast on ground too though.

2314
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:03,040
We're so close you guys!

2315
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:04,200
We're actually so close!

2316
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:08,740
Good job team!

2317
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:14,360
That's so stinky.

2318
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:22,080
That's mean.

2319
02:36:30,230 --> 02:36:31,930
This stupid bird!

2320
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:34,490
Oh my god, his tail!

2321
02:36:36,030 --> 02:36:41,530
There's nothing scarier than looking through your viewfinder and he's coming charging right at you.

2322
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:48,010
I think that just blew me up because of the bird.

2323
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:52,210
This guy.

2324
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:53,810
Not a bird.

2325
02:36:53,930 --> 02:36:54,530
You know what I mean.

2326
02:36:56,610 --> 02:36:57,830
Are you gonna come at me?

2327
02:37:02,330 --> 02:37:02,730
Ouch.

2328
02:37:04,970 --> 02:37:06,930
He's getting a little aggressive I think.

2329
02:37:06,970 --> 02:37:08,050
I think he's a little upset.

2330
02:37:11,070 --> 02:37:12,990
I think he's a little mad.

2331
02:37:14,150 --> 02:37:15,790
It's a big ol' heckin' bird!

2332
02:37:21,150 --> 02:37:22,230
Stay down!

2333
02:37:27,810 --> 02:37:30,010
Where did I throw it?

2334
02:37:30,050 --> 02:37:30,970
It's like over here, no?

2335
02:37:36,310 --> 02:37:37,750
What do we do?

2336
02:37:38,130 --> 02:37:38,930
What are we thinking?

2337
02:37:42,110 --> 02:37:43,870
You think he misses his tail?

2338
02:37:44,730 --> 02:37:46,110
He looks like my cat now.

2339
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:48,370
He's upset.

2340
02:37:48,370 --> 02:37:49,230
Upsetty spaghetti.

2341
02:37:50,530 --> 02:37:51,830
He took off his tail.

2342
02:37:52,230 --> 02:37:53,490
You think he's upset about it though?

2343
02:37:58,470 --> 02:37:59,230
Nice hit.

2344
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:15,500
Sorry.

2345
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,160
Clunky, I might have shot that at you.

2346
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:21,780
What the hell?

2347
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:22,260
Oh my god.

2348
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:22,940
He's dead!

2349
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:25,620
I thought he was coming at me.

2350
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:27,620
Quick!

2351
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:28,900
Grab some meat!

2352
02:38:29,660 --> 02:38:31,220
Grab a prize!

2353
02:38:32,520 --> 02:38:34,360
I'm a master hunter.

2354
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:38,920
I'm a master hunter.

2355
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:43,460
Carve him up!

2356
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,280
Roast him!

2357
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:46,840
Get away!

2358
02:38:47,080 --> 02:38:47,780
The tail...

2359
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:49,720
The tail would have been so delicious.

2360
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:56,840
Good job team.

2361
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,700
We got some new stuff.

2362
02:39:02,060 --> 02:39:03,360
I wonder what it would taste.

2363
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:05,520
Maybe like a crocodile.

2364
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:15,880
Happy ending.

2365
02:39:26,460 --> 02:39:27,240
Aw.

2366
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:30,900
I can find him.

2367
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:33,860
I can find him.

2368
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:43,680
There's a Rathalos armor set.

2369
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:44,420
What?

2370
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:48,660
This part is actually clever.

2371
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:49,900
This part is pretty fun.

2372
02:39:59,280 --> 02:39:59,820
Okay.

2373
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:03,140
Oh, is there a Rathalos?

2374
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:04,840
Oh, I thought you said there is.

2375
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:06,460
My reading comprehension.

2376
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:10,650
And look, there's also Tigrex.

2377
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:18,820
So...

2378
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:21,560
Which one is it?

2379
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:25,860
Is it this one?

2380
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:34,980
The first one?

2381
02:40:39,570 --> 02:40:41,850
Let's first search Mother Base.

2382
02:40:45,370 --> 02:40:46,250
Special treat.

2383
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:49,690
Let's search base first.

2384
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:50,910
You know, he might still be around.

2385
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:52,670
He might still be hanging out, you know?

2386
02:40:54,550 --> 02:40:54,990
So...

2387
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:57,010
He might be...

2388
02:40:57,010 --> 02:40:57,950
You know, just about.

2389
02:40:58,270 --> 02:40:59,590
I'll do it by myself though.

2390
02:41:05,770 --> 02:41:06,570
Stealth.

2391
02:41:07,670 --> 02:41:09,090
We'll do sneaky.

2392
02:41:11,150 --> 02:41:12,270
Good idea, boss.

2393
02:41:14,730 --> 02:41:17,970
And you know, we can practice our shooting.

2394
02:41:18,610 --> 02:41:20,150
At the same time.

2395
02:41:32,030 --> 02:41:33,410
That's suspicious.

2396
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:34,950
Snake, are you laughing?

2397
02:41:35,730 --> 02:41:36,390
What's so funny?

2398
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:38,770
That was weird.

2399
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:41,430
That was suspicious.

2400
02:41:45,330 --> 02:41:46,930
You guys hear something?

2401
02:41:48,070 --> 02:41:49,870
Did you guys hear something?

2402
02:41:52,110 --> 02:41:53,710
No, there's no way.

2403
02:41:54,410 --> 02:41:55,210
There's no way.

2404
02:41:55,670 --> 02:41:56,290
There's no way.

2405
02:41:57,270 --> 02:41:58,670
There's no way.

2406
02:41:58,670 --> 02:41:59,330
There's no way.

2407
02:41:59,330 --> 02:41:59,330
Oh,

2408
02:42:09,250 --> 02:42:10,710
I gotta reload.

2409
02:42:11,850 --> 02:42:13,270
There's no way.

2410
02:42:13,430 --> 02:42:14,390
Snake, what's so funny?

2411
02:42:20,990 --> 02:42:21,950
Snake...

2412
02:42:21,950 --> 02:42:25,150
Maybe perhaps we should...

2413
02:42:26,150 --> 02:42:27,110
Maybe...

2414
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:31,410
Maybe perhaps we should...

2415
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:34,150
Investigate...

2416
02:42:36,730 --> 02:42:37,930
Maybe perhaps...

2417
02:42:37,930 --> 02:42:39,330
He could be...

2418
02:42:39,330 --> 02:42:41,110
Hold on, maybe if I can...

2419
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:42,230
Maybe he could be...

2420
02:42:42,230 --> 02:42:43,850
Hold on, if I can do this...

2421
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:45,550
Oh, I wish we could jump.

2422
02:42:45,890 --> 02:42:46,410
Wait, hold on.

2423
02:42:46,650 --> 02:42:48,310
He could be...

2424
02:42:48,310 --> 02:42:50,490
Right under our nose.

2425
02:42:54,470 --> 02:42:57,490
He could be right under our nose...

2426
02:42:57,490 --> 02:42:59,470
The whole time.

2427
02:42:59,470 --> 02:43:00,170
The

2428
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:14,100
whole time.

2429
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:14,100
What

2430
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:21,020
do you mean, minus two?

2431
02:43:21,180 --> 02:43:22,080
That was good.

2432
02:43:22,820 --> 02:43:24,440
Don't even lie to me.

2433
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,040
Don't even lie.

2434
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:27,960
Okay, I think I have to get him from down here.

2435
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:30,540
Can we get him on this side?

2436
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:35,580
Oh, nope.

2437
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:38,460
Oh wait, oh.

2438
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:39,500
This is why.

2439
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,020
Aw man, I forgot it.

2440
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:53,380
Plus two.

2441
02:43:54,020 --> 02:43:54,720
Thank you.

2442
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:03,300
This part was difficult to decipher without guides or anything else shortly after.

2443
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:04,200
I believe it.

2444
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:05,130
I believe it 100%.

2445
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:12,530
Rare actual cutscene.

2446
02:44:14,610 --> 02:44:15,270
Oh my god.

2447
02:44:15,650 --> 02:44:17,130
Are we gonna see Rocket Pierce?

2448
02:44:17,530 --> 02:44:18,650
I'm so excited!

2449
02:44:23,130 --> 02:44:25,090
What are you talking about?

2450
02:44:25,650 --> 02:44:27,290
V for victory!

2451
02:44:27,570 --> 02:44:28,650
V for victory!

2452
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:30,730
Rocket Pierce!

2453
02:44:36,710 --> 02:44:39,350
You're so lame, Zdornov.

2454
02:44:45,290 --> 02:44:47,730
So lame, this guy.

2455
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:51,110
Dies in one shot.

2456
02:44:51,170 --> 02:44:53,190
Guys, I found Zdornov.

2457
02:44:53,190 --> 02:44:54,870
I had to kill him.

2458
02:44:58,090 --> 02:44:59,550
Something's not right here.

2459
02:45:00,010 --> 02:45:01,170
I'm thinking he had a friend.

2460
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:06,050
What's going on?

2461
02:45:07,730 --> 02:45:07,870
What?

2462
02:45:15,090 --> 02:45:16,450
Uh oh!

2463
02:45:18,050 --> 02:45:18,730
No!

2464
02:45:20,950 --> 02:45:21,910
Uh oh!

2465
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:25,210
V for victory!

2466
02:45:26,110 --> 02:45:27,390
Rocket Pierce!

2467
02:45:30,750 --> 02:45:32,030
Uh oh.

2468
02:45:43,320 --> 02:45:46,800
I've just finished building you.

2469
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:51,240
I just finished!

2470
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:54,320
Please!

2471
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:59,380
Uh oh.

2472
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:05,080
What?

2473
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:19,080
Metal Gear Z.

2474
02:46:29,140 --> 02:46:30,260
Then how's it moving?

2475
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:40,480
Modifications?

2476
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,640
Oh my god, she's so cute.

2477
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:48,960
Oh my god!

2478
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:08,800
Pacifica Ocean!

2479
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:13,440
I love you!

2480
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:30,740
Uh oh.

2481
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:39,020
No!

2482
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:43,960
Pause!

2483
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:53,200
Uh oh.

2484
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:56,460
Oh yeah, I love me an expedition.

2485
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,080
Exposition drop.

2486
02:48:18,280 --> 02:48:19,040
Zero?

2487
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:31,220
I don't think you can divide by zero.

2488
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:48,500
A world without borders.

2489
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:50,580
A world without borders?

2490
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:53,120
The Cold War order is about to collapse.

2491
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:56,420
The age of electronic intelligence is about to begin.

2492
02:48:57,180 --> 02:49:00,180
The NSA, CSS, NRO, DIA, etc.

2493
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:00,340
etc.

2494
02:49:00,340 --> 02:49:01,320
Bring on the robots.

2495
02:49:01,720 --> 02:49:06,880
The intelligence community that is long bickered amongst itself will be united in a world governed by electrons.

2496
02:49:08,020 --> 02:49:12,480
Cipher will gather all information, watching over the world and guiding the will of its people.

2497
02:49:12,700 --> 02:49:14,600
All while they remain blissfully unaware.

2498
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:17,340
There will be no one to oppose them.

2499
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:20,840
For the first time, the world will be ruled by a single will.

2500
02:49:22,180 --> 02:49:26,640
Until the new order is in place, you and your army will be the force that protects it.

2501
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:33,160
You will be Cipher's deterrent, pulling the wool over the eyes of the old order with your charisma and military prowess.

2502
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:39,860
Accept our offer and we will allow you to retain control of MSF and Zeke.

2503
02:49:40,460 --> 02:49:41,540
That's an offer?

2504
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:47,180
Creep.

2505
02:49:53,940 --> 02:49:55,820
Cipher and his wife.

2506
02:50:01,640 --> 02:50:03,620
It's so dumb.

2507
02:50:11,920 --> 02:50:13,600
Cipher's going to control guns.

2508
02:50:14,180 --> 02:50:15,140
Control guns?

2509
02:50:16,520 --> 02:50:16,520
That's right.

2510
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:17,140
Not deter.

2511
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:17,740
Control.

2512
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:20,800
It is the ultimate approach to the illusion of peace.

2513
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:22,100
Control power.

2514
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:23,360
You're gonna be disappointed.

2515
02:50:23,900 --> 02:50:24,820
Then we are done.

2516
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:26,240
Thank you for playing.

2517
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:29,760
The offer is received.

2518
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:30,920
Lambda, thank you!

2519
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,220
And now, the ultimatum.

2520
02:50:33,080 --> 02:50:35,600
Zeke is already in nuclear strike mode.

2521
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:35,940
Uh oh!

2522
02:50:36,120 --> 02:50:41,680
I'm taking the weapon you built and using it to launch a nuclear strike on the east coast of the United States.

2523
02:50:41,780 --> 02:50:42,500
You're insane.

2524
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:43,380
What are you after?

2525
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:44,340
But wait.

2526
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:46,400
Here is your consolation prize.

2527
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:53,460
We are about to show the world just how dangerous a gang of outlaws, an army without borders, can be.

2528
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:56,120
You and your men will become pariahs.

2529
02:50:56,120 --> 02:50:59,820
Prototype Rex needed a water room, I guess.

2530
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:06,520
Rather than heroes, you will be seen as a well-armed extremist cult prone to indiscriminate outbursts of nuclear aggression.

2531
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:13,160
You will give rise to a new world order, an age of deterrence defined by a fear of extremism.

2532
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:15,840
So true.

2533
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:20,800
Do you like the potential of being boss?

2534
02:51:21,780 --> 02:51:24,920
When all is said and done, peace is nothing but a fantasy.

2535
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:26,420
A game is a game.

2536
02:51:26,960 --> 02:51:28,760
You either win or lose.

2537
02:51:30,040 --> 02:51:31,620
All you can do is fight.

2538
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:34,960
Stop me if you can.

2539
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:39,400
The peace sign is the V of victory.

2540
02:51:41,220 --> 02:51:41,900
Say...

2541
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:42,700
Peace!

2542
02:51:43,180 --> 02:51:44,500
She's so cute.

2543
02:51:45,420 --> 02:51:46,860
She's too cute.

2544
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:49,160
Pause!

2545
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:53,700
Pacific Ocean, why did you do that?

2546
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:54,780
Say peace!

2547
02:52:00,850 --> 02:52:02,510
She's gonna launch a nuke.

2548
02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:04,490
Snake, we've got to stop her.

2549
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:05,450
Whatever it takes.

2550
02:52:05,810 --> 02:52:06,650
Awaiting your orders.

2551
02:52:09,150 --> 02:52:09,670
Ah!

2552
02:52:10,570 --> 02:52:12,910
Can't believe the love box No!

2553
02:52:14,130 --> 02:52:15,310
It meant everything!

2554
02:52:15,930 --> 02:52:16,170
It

2555
02:52:19,260 --> 02:52:20,040
meant...

2556
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:20,800
Yes.

2557
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:23,780
You guys ready for the last fight?

2558
02:52:23,940 --> 02:52:26,200
Before we do the last fight...

2559
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:31,420
Should I listen to some of Paws' tapes?

2560
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:35,020
Can't remember if I do it before or after.

2561
02:52:39,820 --> 02:52:40,460
Yeah.

2562
02:52:50,030 --> 02:52:52,430
I don't know why I didn't just press mission select.

2563
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:56,070
I'm so used to pressing mother base because we always collect guys.

2564
02:52:56,850 --> 02:52:57,870
Zeke battle!

2565
02:52:58,670 --> 02:53:00,230
It's the last one!

2566
02:53:01,990 --> 02:53:03,790
Yeah, nice break before.

2567
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:05,590
Before the fight, right?

2568
02:53:07,930 --> 02:53:15,430
People can join, but I'm gonna be listening to the briefing file, so Let's see.

2569
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:18,350
Let's do, like, about herself, right?

2570
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:20,250
Let's do these.

2571
02:53:21,310 --> 02:53:22,710
And then we should be good.

2572
02:53:26,790 --> 02:53:30,750
We know all this is a lie now.

2573
02:53:30,850 --> 02:53:33,350
It's just funny, but...

2574
02:53:33,350 --> 02:53:36,450
Mr. Superchat!

2575
02:53:36,910 --> 02:53:37,850
Thank you!

2576
02:53:38,450 --> 02:53:40,010
Thanks for fighting with us!

2577
02:53:42,670 --> 02:53:43,250
Thank you!

2578
02:53:44,610 --> 02:53:48,790
Thank you!

2579
02:53:50,410 --> 02:53:53,990
But his is in Japanese!

2580
02:54:07,210 --> 02:54:08,890
Cosplay time!

2581
02:54:21,090 --> 02:54:25,550
Now that I think about it, it's true!

2582
02:54:41,390 --> 02:54:41,910
What?

2583
02:54:42,390 --> 02:54:43,010
It is?

2584
02:54:44,170 --> 02:54:44,850
Wait, actually?

2585
02:54:46,290 --> 02:54:48,190
Uh-oh, I do it all the time.

2586
02:54:48,790 --> 02:54:49,310
It's true?

2587
02:54:49,550 --> 02:54:49,970
Yes?

2588
02:54:50,930 --> 02:54:53,330
Wait, what does it mean if I turn it around?

2589
02:54:54,770 --> 02:54:58,750
What about all, like, the gyaru babes who, like, do it by their eye?

2590
02:55:00,590 --> 02:55:02,090
It's like a middle finger?

2591
02:55:03,630 --> 02:55:04,670
No way.

2592
02:55:05,250 --> 02:55:05,710
What?

2593
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:07,170
I learned that.

2594
02:55:07,170 --> 02:55:08,210
F you!

2595
02:55:10,250 --> 02:55:11,690
Maybe not anymore.

2596
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:15,990
What?

2597
02:55:16,170 --> 02:55:17,090
That's crazy.

2598
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:19,830
Backhanded pieces?

2599
02:55:20,010 --> 02:55:21,370
Like, I do it just to be cute.

2600
02:55:39,790 --> 02:55:40,570
In a way.

2601
02:55:41,210 --> 02:55:42,670
My aunts were kind to me and all.

2602
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:47,510
But I know how difficult it must have been to suddenly have a child thrust into their lives.

2603
02:55:47,810 --> 02:55:50,310
When you live with someone, there are no secrets.

2604
02:55:51,070 --> 02:55:53,490
I could tell my being there was a burden on them.

2605
02:55:54,850 --> 02:55:56,310
Sounds like a rough childhood.

2606
02:55:56,690 --> 02:55:57,870
I would not say that.

2607
02:55:58,550 --> 02:56:00,510
I was lucky just to have people take me in.

2608
02:56:00,910 --> 02:56:04,490
There were funnels leaving out in the streets because their mothers died.

2609
02:56:05,150 --> 02:56:07,830
It is even worse in countries with frequent civil wars.

2610
02:56:07,830 --> 02:56:11,130
So, who am I to complain about my childhood?

2611
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:12,870
You're a pretty tough kid, you know.

2612
02:56:13,250 --> 02:56:13,890
Not at all.

2613
02:56:14,590 --> 02:56:16,030
I am not strong at all.

2614
02:56:16,210 --> 02:56:16,530
Wee.

2615
02:56:18,730 --> 02:56:19,150
Wee.

2616
02:56:19,270 --> 02:56:21,270
And last, a roll of Mother Base.

2617
02:56:23,070 --> 02:56:24,910
I have a favor to ask you, Snake.

2618
02:56:25,210 --> 02:56:25,710
Name it.

2619
02:56:25,990 --> 02:56:27,630
I want you to give me a job here.

2620
02:56:28,130 --> 02:56:29,050
I want to help out.

2621
02:56:29,310 --> 02:56:29,810
You sure?

2622
02:56:30,350 --> 02:56:31,990
You just went through hell of a time.

2623
02:56:32,750 --> 02:56:34,670
You should probably take it easy until you've settled.

2624
02:56:34,670 --> 02:56:35,470
She's so cute.

2625
02:56:36,270 --> 02:56:37,970
But there must be something I can do.

2626
02:56:38,430 --> 02:56:39,950
You would not want me near a gun.

2627
02:56:40,690 --> 02:56:41,930
But I am a decent cook.

2628
02:56:42,250 --> 02:56:44,270
Now, there's a skill we can use.

2629
02:56:44,590 --> 02:56:45,970
Put me on the mess hall team.

2630
02:56:46,670 --> 02:56:47,870
I think I can handle it.

2631
02:56:48,490 --> 02:56:52,190
Once I get used to it, I will even add in some Costa Rican recipes.

2632
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:53,890
Sounds like a plan.

2633
02:56:55,270 --> 02:56:55,710
She...

2634
02:56:55,710 --> 02:56:57,570
You can't even select her.

2635
02:56:58,330 --> 02:57:01,490
I guess to not have you put her in combat would be so bad.

2636
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:04,170
Ah...

2637
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:05,350
She's our little mascot.

2638
02:57:06,810 --> 02:57:07,130
Okay.

2639
02:57:10,730 --> 02:57:11,530
We haven't heard...

2640
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:11,910
Oh, wait.

2641
02:57:12,070 --> 02:57:12,270
Ah!

2642
02:57:13,530 --> 02:57:14,350
Pause this tape.

2643
02:57:14,430 --> 02:57:15,490
This is what I wanted to listen to.

2644
02:57:15,570 --> 02:57:17,050
Sorry, I was like...

2645
02:57:17,050 --> 02:57:18,810
I forgot about... I was like, wait a second.

2646
02:57:18,890 --> 02:57:21,330
I don't see the ones... And then all these messages from Eva.

2647
02:57:39,770 --> 02:57:40,250
Zulu?

2648
02:57:43,270 --> 02:57:45,390
You want to listen to her diaries before granting?

2649
02:57:45,810 --> 02:57:46,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2650
02:57:49,090 --> 02:57:51,430
You get the diaries after the final fight?

2651
02:57:51,530 --> 02:57:52,490
That's what I was asking before.

2652
02:57:53,730 --> 02:57:54,210
Oh.

2653
02:58:05,070 --> 02:58:07,890
I like how it's like, who could these two ladies be?

2654
02:58:08,890 --> 02:58:12,790
Why do they hate the East Coast?

2655
02:58:13,210 --> 02:58:18,770
Maybe because Washington, D.C.?

2656
02:58:24,270 --> 02:58:25,950
Is this Laurie Allen?

2657
02:58:27,770 --> 02:58:28,050
Yes!

2658
02:58:37,150 --> 02:58:38,550
Yes!

2659
02:59:01,050 --> 02:59:02,450
Oh!

2660
02:59:04,970 --> 02:59:05,410
Oh!

2661
02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:22,390
The sorrow.

2662
02:59:22,390 --> 02:59:23,610
Yeah.

2663
02:59:41,110 --> 02:59:45,830
I want someone to ask Chad JPT all of these questions.

2664
02:59:45,830 --> 02:59:46,390
It's too vicious.

2665
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:50,290
Aww.

2666
02:59:53,710 --> 02:59:54,250
Aww.

2667
03:00:18,680 --> 03:00:19,580
Who's there?

2668
03:00:59,480 --> 03:01:01,240
It's fine, they were mowing the lawn.

2669
03:01:01,440 --> 03:01:01,800
Yeah.

2670
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:08,600
Oh, last mission!

2671
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:11,780
Oh, it's so good!

2672
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:12,620
I'm so excited.

2673
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:15,220
Final battle.

2674
03:01:20,450 --> 03:01:22,150
I can't wait.

2675
03:01:22,470 --> 03:01:23,170
I'm already...

2676
03:01:23,170 --> 03:01:24,270
I'm already...

2677
03:01:24,270 --> 03:01:27,110
I'm already...

2678
03:01:28,210 --> 03:01:31,390
Actually, I should have gone to the bathroom first.

2679
03:01:33,650 --> 03:01:34,770
We're fine.

2680
03:01:41,170 --> 03:01:42,290
I'm so excited.

2681
03:01:43,410 --> 03:01:45,410
Best final boss fight.

2682
03:01:45,530 --> 03:01:46,590
It's too good.

2683
03:01:47,050 --> 03:01:48,710
I love this fight so much.

2684
03:01:51,150 --> 03:01:52,830
I love this fight so much.

2685
03:01:54,170 --> 03:01:55,290
Okay, pause.

2686
03:01:55,670 --> 03:01:56,990
I love you so much.

2687
03:01:58,130 --> 03:01:58,770
And my cat.

2688
03:01:58,950 --> 03:01:59,870
I love my cat too.

2689
03:02:05,400 --> 03:02:07,240
Go on with the tea.

2690
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:15,620
Half of Kaz's lines in this are...

2691
03:02:15,620 --> 03:02:17,320
Stop the nuke!

2692
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:18,740
It's gonna launch a nuke!

2693
03:03:00,820 --> 03:03:02,660
Try not to beat her too fast!

2694
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:04,820
I might just vibe.

2695
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:24,240
Rations though.

2696
03:04:25,730 --> 03:04:26,210
Oh, shit.

2697
03:04:40,480 --> 03:04:41,880
The

2698
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:49,600
little helicopter...

2699
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:50,400
Or the little balloon.

2700
03:04:51,260 --> 03:04:51,740
Woo!

2701
03:04:56,240 --> 03:04:58,200
Yeah, we did this!

2702
03:05:11,190 --> 03:05:12,150
Is

2703
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:26,220
that such a screw up?

2704
03:05:31,800 --> 03:05:33,460
Oh, Mobius!

2705
03:06:14,630 --> 03:06:14,910
Nice!

2706
03:06:14,910 --> 03:06:18,170
I died at the end of the song!

2707
03:06:23,310 --> 03:06:24,430
Oh!

2708
03:06:25,270 --> 03:06:26,390
Sorry!

2709
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:38,480
Instrumental!

2710
03:06:43,330 --> 03:06:44,910
Oh my god.

2711
03:06:46,470 --> 03:06:48,210
I need to call more suppliers.

2712
03:06:52,780 --> 03:06:53,900
Mobius!

2713
03:06:55,400 --> 03:06:56,040
You got it.

2714
03:07:38,090 --> 03:07:39,250
Did you?

2715
03:07:42,290 --> 03:07:42,450
Pause!

2716
03:07:42,830 --> 03:07:43,210
Pause!

2717
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:46,530
Wait, transport?

2718
03:07:47,130 --> 03:07:50,510
Oh, there it is.

2719
03:07:52,130 --> 03:07:54,110
Wait, what was that?

2720
03:08:00,270 --> 03:08:01,570
Okay!

2721
03:09:09,190 --> 03:09:10,590
Pause!

2722
03:09:21,890 --> 03:09:23,290
Stop!

2723
03:09:23,310 --> 03:09:23,330
Pause!

2724
03:09:25,890 --> 03:09:27,190
Mmm...

2725
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:58,080
Pause!

2726
03:09:59,360 --> 03:09:59,560
Pause!

2727
03:09:59,560 --> 03:10:01,140
I mean, she's not wrong though.

2728
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:07,200
Dramatic pause.

2729
03:10:39,410 --> 03:10:41,170
Who would have thought?

2730
03:10:46,370 --> 03:10:48,390
Who would have thought that?

2731
03:10:49,730 --> 03:10:56,330
He sounds so disingenuous all the time.

2732
03:11:02,490 --> 03:11:04,870
Who would have thought that?

2733
03:11:04,870 --> 03:11:05,670
Huey!

2734
03:11:05,670 --> 03:11:06,590
Huey!

2735
03:11:07,530 --> 03:11:09,310
Who would have thought?

2736
03:11:13,050 --> 03:11:14,970
Yeah, how would it happen again?

2737
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:18,510
Oh god.

2738
03:11:19,170 --> 03:11:24,670
Who would have thought that a little girl would betray us?

2739
03:11:25,750 --> 03:11:26,770
Hey Snake!

2740
03:11:27,130 --> 03:11:29,030
Just in case you get betrayed again.

2741
03:11:30,930 --> 03:11:32,070
You might wanna...

2742
03:11:34,170 --> 03:11:37,490
You might wanna practice in case you get betrayed again.

2743
03:11:43,210 --> 03:11:48,670
Why does he look like that?

2744
03:11:48,730 --> 03:11:49,910
He looks like he's decaying.

2745
03:11:52,370 --> 03:11:55,030
Oh my god, she's so beautiful.

2746
03:11:56,250 --> 03:11:57,190
Good lord!

2747
03:12:01,770 --> 03:12:02,390
Pity.

2748
03:12:03,350 --> 03:12:06,370
Because I've just had my heart broken by someone else.

2749
03:12:07,990 --> 03:12:08,610
What?

2750
03:12:09,210 --> 03:12:12,270
I only like those who can stand on their own.

2751
03:12:12,730 --> 03:12:16,650
If you fancy me, then come walk with me.

2752
03:12:17,490 --> 03:12:20,210
Who knows what miracles might happen.

2753
03:12:20,450 --> 03:12:23,390
Love is blind after all.

2754
03:12:23,750 --> 03:12:25,170
Oh no, that's a bad TV show.

2755
03:12:25,650 --> 03:12:28,450
Actually, that show has proven anything.

2756
03:12:28,850 --> 03:12:30,230
It has proven that it is not.

2757
03:12:30,910 --> 03:12:31,970
I'll be waiting.

2758
03:12:32,270 --> 03:12:33,950
God, she's so beautiful.

2759
03:12:35,870 --> 03:12:37,730
Oh, strange love.

2760
03:12:41,190 --> 03:12:42,550
Don't do it girl!

2761
03:12:43,110 --> 03:12:43,490
No!

2762
03:12:44,210 --> 03:12:45,730
Don't walk, run!

2763
03:12:46,210 --> 03:12:47,390
Don't walk, run!

2764
03:12:47,830 --> 03:12:49,130
Strange love, please!

2765
03:12:49,390 --> 03:12:51,610
God, if I had a time machine.

2766
03:12:56,740 --> 03:12:58,060
Lupus, happy birthday!

2767
03:13:01,830 --> 03:13:03,210
A kiss for a present?

2768
03:13:03,210 --> 03:13:06,650
That's probably the immediate offer.

2769
03:13:07,490 --> 03:13:09,170
Request, I mean.

2770
03:13:17,490 --> 03:13:19,690
Myth, you'll create a time paradox.

2771
03:13:20,070 --> 03:13:20,910
Oh gosh.

2772
03:13:23,230 --> 03:13:24,970
I just want her away from that man.

2773
03:13:29,850 --> 03:13:31,470
So un-serious.

2774
03:13:42,920 --> 03:13:44,340
I have a cramp.

2775
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:58,620
Oh boy.

2776
03:14:11,920 --> 03:14:12,660
Gosh.

2777
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:26,600
Everybody does that.

2778
03:14:26,800 --> 03:14:28,060
How does...

2779
03:14:31,880 --> 03:14:35,140
That's why he liked her so much.

2780
03:14:35,440 --> 03:14:38,060
She reminded him of Ocelot.

2781
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:43,900
This mercenary business we built.

2782
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:48,480
Someday it's gonna be a new driving force in the world economy.

2783
03:14:49,960 --> 03:14:51,840
Is that your goal all along?

2784
03:14:52,920 --> 03:14:54,960
The Cold War is not gonna last forever.

2785
03:14:55,320 --> 03:14:55,940
Does Kaz have teeth?

2786
03:15:00,320 --> 03:15:01,720
Kaz smiled for me.

2787
03:15:01,900 --> 03:15:02,880
Oh, I see them in there.

2788
03:15:03,220 --> 03:15:05,380
He looks like a toothless baby.

2789
03:15:13,960 --> 03:15:15,080
Poor economy.

2790
03:15:15,800 --> 03:15:16,660
Kaz, I hear you.

2791
03:15:16,780 --> 03:15:17,500
Please shut up.

2792
03:15:20,820 --> 03:15:22,220
Please shut up.

2793
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:23,640
Please shut up.

2794
03:15:24,400 --> 03:15:25,240
It's all gum.

2795
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:43,000
He's wearing that cypher outfit.

2796
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:48,980
Kaz met Ocelot yet?

2797
03:15:49,720 --> 03:15:50,640
I don't think so.

2798
03:15:52,420 --> 03:15:56,760
It wore a chance.

2799
03:15:57,040 --> 03:15:58,420
Kaz, I'm Japanese, really.

2800
03:16:00,680 --> 03:16:02,080
He's just a little more charismatic.

2801
03:16:12,560 --> 03:16:17,880
And these people would rather our army without borders not exist at all?

2802
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:36,380
Then who are we gonna fight?

2803
03:16:37,740 --> 03:16:38,440
The establishment.

2804
03:16:39,160 --> 03:16:43,580
Anybody who tries to restore the old balance wants to snuff us out of existence.

2805
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:45,480
Which establishment?

2806
03:16:47,320 --> 03:16:51,240
It won't be a particular country or ideology that hunts us.

2807
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:52,280
Who then?

2808
03:16:53,300 --> 03:16:55,820
We're gonna be fighting the biggest beast of all.

2809
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:57,540
The Times.

2810
03:16:59,800 --> 03:17:04,240
Ten years ago, the Times rejected the boss and killed her.

2811
03:17:04,240 --> 03:17:08,960
And now, we are the ones being tested.

2812
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:12,520
Will the Times erase us?

2813
03:17:13,460 --> 03:17:14,780
Or work with us?

2814
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:16,800
It's gonna be a lonely battle.

2815
03:17:17,820 --> 03:17:18,580
No good or evil.

2816
03:17:18,940 --> 03:17:20,460
No winners or losers.

2817
03:17:21,580 --> 03:17:22,800
Christmas will have to wait.

2818
03:17:23,380 --> 03:17:29,060
The question we have to ask ourselves now is, can we survive long enough to see the 21st century?

2819
03:17:30,620 --> 03:17:31,780
I'm with you, boss.

2820
03:17:31,780 --> 03:17:34,300
We'll see how it turns out together.

2821
03:17:34,980 --> 03:17:35,740
What a simp.

2822
03:17:35,900 --> 03:17:40,320
You can't see it, but he had his little hand on it.

2823
03:17:40,740 --> 03:17:43,980
It looked like it was about to bow at him.

2824
03:17:44,680 --> 03:17:45,700
The time has come.

2825
03:17:47,660 --> 03:17:49,020
The hunt is on, Kaz.

2826
03:17:52,810 --> 03:17:54,890
And the whole world is on our tail.

2827
03:17:57,630 --> 03:17:58,530
Assemble the men.

2828
03:17:59,650 --> 03:18:00,330
Woohoo!

2829
03:18:01,630 --> 03:18:04,110
Thanks for this playthrough, Peace Walker Love!

2830
03:18:04,310 --> 03:18:05,630
Peace Walker Love!

2831
03:18:05,710 --> 03:18:06,350
Thanks Sam!

2832
03:18:12,800 --> 03:18:14,920
I love that fight so much.

2833
03:18:15,140 --> 03:18:16,280
I wanna do it again.

2834
03:18:19,980 --> 03:18:21,180
Assemble the men.

2835
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,060
I'm sorry, I can't read all of this.

2836
03:18:29,800 --> 03:18:31,500
Noble Peace Prize.

2837
03:18:33,800 --> 03:18:37,680
Sandinista National Liberation Front takes hostages at a party in the House of the Minister.

2838
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:42,400
Former prisoner of Costa Rica admits to collaborating with the CIA.

2839
03:18:46,480 --> 03:18:48,700
Apollo 18 docked in orbit.

2840
03:18:50,340 --> 03:18:52,140
Soviet Union invades Afghanistan.

2841
03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:54,860
Dr. Emery Kiwi becomes a father!

2842
03:18:55,120 --> 03:18:56,960
He names his son Hal!

2843
03:19:02,140 --> 03:19:06,340
Big Boss triggers the Outer Heaven Uprising!

2844
03:19:09,100 --> 03:19:16,300
She has a son named Haddad.

2845
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:19,980
That's not his name!

2846
03:19:42,520 --> 03:19:45,000
And then yeah, the last one said that.

2847
03:19:45,620 --> 03:19:48,980
Miller is found assassinated and is home.

2848
03:19:53,180 --> 03:19:54,300
What a name.

2849
03:19:54,540 --> 03:19:56,300
Kiwi Hot Dog.

2850
03:19:57,280 --> 03:19:58,420
No, I mean...

2851
03:19:58,420 --> 03:20:00,260
Wait, Hal Hot Dog.

2852
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:17,440
You're pretty good.

2853
03:20:17,540 --> 03:20:18,820
Congrats on beating Peace Walker.

2854
03:20:19,180 --> 03:20:20,660
Thank you Takedo!

2855
03:20:30,980 --> 03:20:32,840
Hot Dog Man.

2856
03:20:34,240 --> 03:20:35,260
Well done, big!

2857
03:20:35,380 --> 03:20:36,140
Peace Walker complete!

2858
03:20:40,200 --> 03:20:41,220
Thank you!

2859
03:20:42,040 --> 03:20:44,100
But what better place for us than this?

2860
03:20:44,840 --> 03:20:47,280
I honestly wish I were playing Ground Zeroes tomorrow.

2861
03:20:48,220 --> 03:20:48,940
Can I switch?

2862
03:20:50,200 --> 03:20:50,740
Is it Minecraft?

2863
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:52,280
Can I play Ground Zeroes tomorrow?

2864
03:21:02,830 --> 03:21:05,090
I can do block game later in the week.

2865
03:21:05,290 --> 03:21:06,610
I can switch some stuff around.

2866
03:21:09,050 --> 03:21:12,270
Actually, I'm going to be 100% honest with you guys.

2867
03:21:15,490 --> 03:21:17,330
I was already going to switch games.

2868
03:21:17,750 --> 03:21:18,870
I was going to play Dredge.

2869
03:21:19,910 --> 03:21:22,650
I was going to play Dredge instead of Minecraft.

2870
03:21:23,850 --> 03:21:25,050
Well, it's Craftmine.

2871
03:21:25,590 --> 03:21:26,610
It's different, actually.

2872
03:21:29,690 --> 03:21:30,690
Donna Burke.

2873
03:21:32,810 --> 03:21:34,110
Ah, Donna Burke!

2874
03:21:34,110 --> 03:21:36,350
Yeah, Chris Zimmerman!

2875
03:21:39,110 --> 03:21:43,570
I like this place.

2876
03:21:57,390 --> 03:21:58,030
And...

2877
03:21:58,030 --> 03:21:58,310
I

2878
03:22:04,570 --> 03:22:10,910
think Ground Zeroes would be really good to follow up right after this game.

2879
03:22:11,950 --> 03:22:12,710
I feel.

2880
03:22:14,670 --> 03:22:17,550
This is such a good punch right after this game.

2881
03:22:18,270 --> 03:22:19,270
I think it might be good.

2882
03:22:20,510 --> 03:22:21,670
I think it might be good.

2883
03:22:23,850 --> 03:22:25,130
I'm doing it right now.

2884
03:22:26,150 --> 03:22:27,450
I have stuff to go after this.

2885
03:22:27,470 --> 03:22:28,910
Otherwise, I wouldn't.

2886
03:22:32,730 --> 03:22:35,630
And there's a couple of missions I want to do for Ground Zeroes.

2887
03:22:35,650 --> 03:22:37,630
So, it's not going to be just the one main mission.

2888
03:22:39,550 --> 03:22:42,850
The team was so pleased we're having another music video song as the last boss theme.

2889
03:22:43,030 --> 03:22:43,730
I know!

2890
03:22:59,830 --> 03:23:04,070
Jax can fight with our tiny souls!

2891
03:23:08,330 --> 03:23:10,090
This game is just...

2892
03:23:11,390 --> 03:23:12,630
It's everything I love.

2893
03:23:13,730 --> 03:23:15,630
Not enough ocelot, but...

2894
03:23:18,350 --> 03:23:20,490
Grants on beating Peacelogger, thank you!

2895
03:23:45,360 --> 03:23:47,120
Never enough ocelot, it's the truth.

2896
03:23:50,620 --> 03:23:51,380
We have a pause date?

2897
03:23:51,500 --> 03:23:53,480
No, no, we have to beat the game before we get it.

2898
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,260
We have to beat the game before we get it.

2899
03:24:01,280 --> 03:24:03,440
We go over to Ground Zeroes and then Phantom Pain.

2900
03:24:04,240 --> 03:24:06,420
Ground Zeroes, Phantom Pain, and then...

2901
03:24:06,420 --> 03:24:09,340
That's it for all the mainline games.

2902
03:24:16,260 --> 03:24:17,700
Machi, thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

2903
03:24:17,820 --> 03:24:18,500
Thank you!

2904
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:20,120
Then Delta.

2905
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:24,980
I wonder if I'll be finished with 5 before Delta.

2906
03:24:26,200 --> 03:24:27,640
I didn't think about that.

2907
03:24:29,920 --> 03:24:30,920
Will I be done?

2908
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:34,500
I have to finish Death Stranding 2 before that comes out.

2909
03:24:34,640 --> 03:24:37,000
Or Death Stranding also before Death Stranding 2 comes out.

2910
03:24:38,500 --> 03:24:39,880
Delta is in August!

2911
03:24:40,100 --> 03:24:40,760
Oh my gosh.

2912
03:24:41,700 --> 03:24:43,900
5 is extremely long.

2913
03:24:45,840 --> 03:24:51,920
But I think if I have mods, it won't be so long.

2914
03:24:55,120 --> 03:24:57,840
I think if I have mods, it won't be so long.

2915
03:25:11,510 --> 03:25:13,270
What did the mods do?

2916
03:25:13,370 --> 03:25:18,070
You can get mods that have every soldier you extract is S rank.

2917
03:25:18,630 --> 03:25:20,890
So that would help with a lot of R and D.

2918
03:25:22,450 --> 03:25:27,070
You can have one that makes it so that when you develop stuff, there's no time.

2919
03:25:27,510 --> 03:25:30,330
So it would develop things immediately.

2920
03:25:40,210 --> 03:25:44,130
Yeah, otherwise V is very, very grindy.

2921
03:25:44,390 --> 03:25:45,790
Even more so than this game.

2922
03:25:46,750 --> 03:25:47,550
Congrats on beating V Swagger.

2923
03:25:47,730 --> 03:25:48,310
Thank you, J!

2924
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:59,460
MGS2 for April 30th.

2925
03:25:59,460 --> 03:26:00,800
I already did MGS2.

2926
03:26:01,820 --> 03:26:03,360
And the skateboarding.

2927
03:26:03,520 --> 03:26:04,120
It lasted.

2928
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:25,590
Not even a hello?

2929
03:26:41,350 --> 03:26:44,610
We fight because we are needed.

2930
03:26:45,950 --> 03:26:49,290
We will be the deterrent for those with no other recourse.

2931
03:26:49,930 --> 03:26:52,430
We are soldiers without borders.

2932
03:26:52,850 --> 03:26:55,750
Our purpose defined by the era we live in.

2933
03:26:57,070 --> 03:27:01,530
We will sometimes have to sell ourselves and services.

2934
03:27:02,730 --> 03:27:08,970
If the times demand it, we'll be revolutionaries, criminals, terrorists.

2935
03:27:08,970 --> 03:27:13,490
And yes, we may all be headed straight to hell.

2936
03:27:14,250 --> 03:27:16,730
But what better place for us than this?

2937
03:27:17,590 --> 03:27:19,010
It is our only home.

2938
03:27:19,810 --> 03:27:21,910
Our heaven and our hell.

2939
03:27:23,510 --> 03:27:25,810
This is Outer Heaven.

2940
03:27:27,550 --> 03:27:28,290
Red

2941
03:27:43,060 --> 03:27:44,220
Nice Nice

2942
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:49,800
Nice, nice, nice.

2943
03:27:56,280 --> 03:27:59,160
Someone who played MGSV 10 plus times.

2944
03:27:59,340 --> 03:28:00,700
It goes by faster than you think.

2945
03:28:01,020 --> 03:28:02,540
So sick of that damn hospital.

2946
03:28:07,880 --> 03:28:09,280
Congrats on beating the game boss.

2947
03:28:09,540 --> 03:28:10,300
Thank you!

2948
03:28:10,460 --> 03:28:12,320
We still have a little bit to do.

2949
03:28:13,780 --> 03:28:15,460
Still have a little bit to do.

2950
03:28:15,460 --> 03:28:17,080
But didn't I say I unlock stuff?

2951
03:28:17,800 --> 03:28:18,100
Liar.

2952
03:28:19,720 --> 03:28:23,120
Yeah, the intro mission for V is... yeah, something.

2953
03:28:23,860 --> 03:28:24,280
Hold on.

2954
03:28:24,860 --> 03:28:25,620
I offered a host.

2955
03:28:25,720 --> 03:28:27,280
I can solo all four customs?

2956
03:28:27,980 --> 03:28:29,000
No way.

2957
03:28:29,280 --> 03:28:30,140
Micmac, are you insane?

2958
03:28:31,560 --> 03:28:32,980
Customs are much stronger.

2959
03:28:34,200 --> 03:28:34,800
Wait, hold on.

2960
03:28:41,260 --> 03:28:43,340
I don't even have them unlocked.

2961
03:28:44,280 --> 03:28:44,980
Oh wait.

2962
03:28:45,360 --> 03:28:46,540
No, this is a custom.

2963
03:28:48,620 --> 03:28:49,100
Wait.

2964
03:28:50,180 --> 03:28:51,200
Ah, I see, I see.

2965
03:28:51,280 --> 03:28:51,400
OK.

2966
03:28:56,040 --> 03:28:57,000
Wait, I...

2967
03:28:57,000 --> 03:29:01,180
Once I do Pupa custom, I imagine the others will be unlocked, right?

2968
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:02,160
I hope so.

2969
03:29:02,740 --> 03:29:04,020
Last time we'll hear David Hayter.

2970
03:29:04,120 --> 03:29:04,700
I know!

2971
03:29:04,920 --> 03:29:05,980
It's so sad!

2972
03:29:08,220 --> 03:29:09,080
It's so true.

2973
03:29:09,980 --> 03:29:11,940
We really want to get that cause date.

2974
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:15,400
Red skull is spooky.

2975
03:29:16,080 --> 03:29:16,800
No way.

2976
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:18,760
Micmac, you can do it.

2977
03:29:19,120 --> 03:29:21,980
I can solo all four customs in 8 minutes.

2978
03:29:22,620 --> 03:29:25,900
The last type 2 mission took almost 25.

2979
03:29:26,780 --> 03:29:28,360
Customs are much stronger.

2980
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:35,680
OK.

2981
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:37,060
Alright, Micmac.

2982
03:29:39,580 --> 03:29:41,380
I'm taking you up on that offer.

2983
03:29:42,400 --> 03:29:43,160
That's insane.

2984
03:29:43,580 --> 03:29:44,200
How the hell?

2985
03:29:44,200 --> 03:29:44,260
How the hell?

2986
03:29:48,540 --> 03:29:49,100
OK.

2987
03:29:49,580 --> 03:29:50,660
Save me, Micmac.

2988
03:29:50,980 --> 03:29:52,160
I saw that art.

2989
03:29:52,240 --> 03:29:53,040
It's so funny.

2990
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:55,980
It's so... Actually, OK.

2991
03:29:56,100 --> 03:29:57,200
If I...

2992
03:29:59,340 --> 03:30:00,560
Thank you, Micmac.

2993
03:30:00,860 --> 03:30:01,420
It's movies!

2994
03:30:06,240 --> 03:30:07,000
Oh wait.

2995
03:30:07,320 --> 03:30:07,800
Oh wait.

2996
03:30:08,060 --> 03:30:08,800
I... Wait.

2997
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:09,980
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

2998
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:19,750
Unable.

2999
03:30:20,830 --> 03:30:21,310
Alright, Micmac.

3000
03:30:21,510 --> 03:30:22,470
I'm just going to keep searching.

3001
03:30:22,770 --> 03:30:23,450
Nobody else join.

3002
03:30:24,290 --> 03:30:25,090
Nobody else join.

3003
03:30:31,790 --> 03:30:34,110
The customs are mostly about endurance.

3004
03:30:42,850 --> 03:30:44,150
Anyone else want to join?

3005
03:30:46,170 --> 03:30:47,410
I'm already in battle.

3006
03:30:47,410 --> 03:30:49,850
I have to pee so bad though.

3007
03:30:52,630 --> 03:30:55,210
Putting your money where your mouth is, Micmac.

3008
03:30:55,350 --> 03:30:56,110
8 minutes!

3009
03:30:57,970 --> 03:30:58,510
Oh dang.

3010
03:30:59,010 --> 03:31:00,350
You're so lucky that my...

3011
03:31:00,350 --> 03:31:02,850
That my screen is being used.

3012
03:31:03,930 --> 03:31:06,150
That my second monitor is being...

3013
03:31:06,150 --> 03:31:06,390
Wait.

3014
03:31:06,510 --> 03:31:07,170
I have a third one.

3015
03:31:08,530 --> 03:31:11,410
You're so lucky my third monitor doesn't have...

3016
03:31:15,170 --> 03:31:15,730
Have...

3017
03:31:17,450 --> 03:31:20,110
I would pull up the stream timer.

3018
03:31:21,670 --> 03:31:22,910
I would pull it up.

3019
03:31:23,490 --> 03:31:26,390
But I can't access it because I don't have my Windows bar.

3020
03:31:29,030 --> 03:31:30,730
I have to pee so bad.

3021
03:31:30,770 --> 03:31:32,110
If I just stand there, will I be fine?

3022
03:31:34,450 --> 03:31:35,390
Good luck everybody.

3023
03:31:35,490 --> 03:31:36,210
I'll be right back.

3024
03:31:41,980 --> 03:31:44,800
Don't save me if I fall.

3025
03:31:47,320 --> 03:31:49,280
Party break while you get a show.

3026
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:49,600
Alright.

3027
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:52,640
If I come back and Micmac is done, that means...

3028
03:31:53,540 --> 03:31:57,500
I definitely think you should try streaming this game more for 100%!

3029
03:32:00,040 --> 03:32:00,600
Holy...

3030
03:32:01,400 --> 03:32:02,520
100%

3031
03:32:07,260 --> 03:32:08,340
You're timing it?

3032
03:32:08,380 --> 03:32:08,560
Okay.

3033
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:13,020
I'm gonna go get more water.

3034
03:33:25,120 --> 03:33:28,900
Neutralize the Pupa AI with it.

3035
03:35:46,300 --> 03:35:47,700
Dinner and a show.

3036
03:35:49,380 --> 03:35:50,920
Ew, Reggie, get off of me.

3037
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:51,560
What the fuck?

3038
03:35:52,300 --> 03:35:53,440
Yeah, go away.

3039
03:36:00,720 --> 03:36:02,400
Do something, bot.

3040
03:36:08,480 --> 03:36:09,200
I

3041
03:36:12,300 --> 03:36:13,740
thought I'd be dead.

3042
03:36:23,690 --> 03:36:26,270
Not gonna lie, I thought I'd be dead for real.

3043
03:36:30,350 --> 03:36:32,250
I only got hit once?

3044
03:36:33,770 --> 03:36:34,890
No way.

3045
03:36:35,170 --> 03:36:35,990
That's insane.

3046
03:36:36,490 --> 03:36:37,210
No way!

3047
03:36:42,870 --> 03:36:43,410
Micmac?

3048
03:36:44,090 --> 03:36:44,410
What

3049
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:49,240
do you mean you can solo with it?

3050
03:36:53,270 --> 03:36:54,910
I got you, Mic.

3051
03:37:18,580 --> 03:37:20,040
Were we bamboozled?

3052
03:37:25,460 --> 03:37:27,040
Hold on, I'm gonna keep eating my sushi.

3053
03:37:30,260 --> 03:37:31,640
I've never seen him red.

3054
03:37:31,700 --> 03:37:32,360
It's kinda cute.

3055
03:37:33,080 --> 03:37:34,280
I like the alt color.

3056
03:37:44,740 --> 03:37:46,600
I think there's HP scaling.

3057
03:37:49,780 --> 03:37:50,880
I wonder how.

3058
03:38:03,900 --> 03:38:05,180
Oh, you're alive.

3059
03:38:12,860 --> 03:38:14,960
You should watch back the footage of your break sometime.

3060
03:38:15,060 --> 03:38:15,380
It's funny.

3061
03:38:22,200 --> 03:38:23,580
Crush me like an insect.

3062
03:38:24,540 --> 03:38:25,280
She's so cute.

3063
03:38:33,030 --> 03:38:33,990
God dang it.

3064
03:38:36,850 --> 03:38:40,870
Micmac, have you... Have you never done this fight?

3065
03:38:45,770 --> 03:38:48,750
Like, in multiplayer?

3066
03:38:50,530 --> 03:38:51,730
You're doing so well though.

3067
03:38:51,890 --> 03:38:53,490
We're already like halfway.

3068
03:38:54,690 --> 03:38:55,230
A little less.

3069
03:38:55,470 --> 03:38:58,090
Well, more than halfway, but...

3070
03:38:59,350 --> 03:38:59,790
Oh god.

3071
03:39:02,450 --> 03:39:03,590
Co-op scales.

3072
03:39:04,250 --> 03:39:04,830
No way.

3073
03:39:05,330 --> 03:39:07,250
No wonder things were crazy before.

3074
03:39:08,230 --> 03:39:09,170
It's okay, Micmac.

3075
03:39:09,250 --> 03:39:09,930
I believe in you.

3076
03:39:35,870 --> 03:39:36,650
Oh gosh.

3077
03:39:38,110 --> 03:39:38,690
Don't kill me.

3078
03:39:38,990 --> 03:39:39,510
Don't kill me.

3079
03:39:39,910 --> 03:39:40,710
Please don't kill me.

3080
03:39:41,070 --> 03:39:41,570
Oh my god.

3081
03:39:41,870 --> 03:39:42,710
I'm out of everything.

3082
03:39:45,090 --> 03:39:46,670
Did I not bring any food?

3083
03:39:50,370 --> 03:39:51,770
I might be stupid.

3084
03:39:54,830 --> 03:39:56,450
We're at six minutes.

3085
03:39:57,510 --> 03:39:58,830
Oh, Micmac.

3086
03:40:01,970 --> 03:40:03,810
I saw that.

3087
03:40:15,720 --> 03:40:18,300
This is still I feel better though than...

3088
03:40:20,340 --> 03:40:21,020
Even...

3089
03:40:22,220 --> 03:40:25,660
When it was the last team that did P1.

3090
03:40:28,200 --> 03:40:30,060
You guys, eye on the prize.

3091
03:40:30,200 --> 03:40:31,020
Eye on the prize.

3092
03:40:31,020 --> 03:40:34,500
Remember who we're... A girl worth fighting for.

3093
03:40:35,500 --> 03:40:38,240
I want her in a Speedo.

3094
03:40:39,900 --> 03:40:42,720
And... That's about it.

3095
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:48,720
I want her naked on the beach.

3096
03:40:49,460 --> 03:40:52,800
And going inside my box.

3097
03:40:53,960 --> 03:40:56,900
I could care what she wears.

3098
03:40:57,340 --> 03:40:59,760
I want a Speedo.

3099
03:41:00,600 --> 03:41:04,480
I really hope she has a Speedo.

3100
03:41:08,470 --> 03:41:09,530
Oh golly.

3101
03:41:09,670 --> 03:41:10,830
A lot of people are saying what?

3102
03:41:12,090 --> 03:41:13,350
We're in for it.

3103
03:41:14,430 --> 03:41:15,190
Eye on the prize.

3104
03:41:16,170 --> 03:41:17,150
Eye on the prize.

3105
03:41:30,540 --> 03:41:31,760
I'm safe.

3106
03:41:52,480 --> 03:41:54,300
We're almost there.

3107
03:41:54,300 --> 03:41:56,940
Time for

3108
03:42:22,690 --> 03:42:23,570
you to die.

3109
03:42:25,370 --> 03:42:26,150
Might be me.

3110
03:42:26,690 --> 03:42:27,370
Might be me.

3111
03:42:34,520 --> 03:42:35,560
Free pizza!

3112
03:42:38,660 --> 03:42:40,280
Micmac, I hope you don't feel bad.

3113
03:42:41,720 --> 03:42:45,760
I'm really, I'm really, I'm really grateful for you to help so much.

3114
03:42:47,140 --> 03:42:48,640
Yeah, you can do this!

3115
03:42:52,960 --> 03:42:56,340
I don't feel, I hope you don't feel like... Oh my goodness.

3116
03:42:56,500 --> 03:42:56,860
Are you ok?

3117
03:43:00,560 --> 03:43:05,040
I hope you don't feel like... You think I'm upset or anything.

3118
03:43:07,820 --> 03:43:08,340
Wow.

3119
03:43:09,380 --> 03:43:10,580
I really missed that.

3120
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:15,440
You should grab those, you should grab those, those rations right there though, buddy.

3121
03:43:15,920 --> 03:43:16,780
These ones right there?

3122
03:43:17,020 --> 03:43:18,080
You should eat that.

3123
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:19,800
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

3124
03:43:28,940 --> 03:43:29,420
Sorry.

3125
03:43:33,970 --> 03:43:34,950
I can't breathe.

3126
03:43:44,640 --> 03:43:45,120
Sorry,

3127
03:43:49,020 --> 03:43:49,520
I can't breathe.

3128
03:43:51,920 --> 03:43:52,400
Oopsie.

3129
03:43:52,500 --> 03:43:53,180
You know what though?

3130
03:43:54,900 --> 03:43:55,380
Ok.

3131
03:43:59,890 --> 03:44:01,270
As soon as she's on top of there.

3132
03:44:07,690 --> 03:44:08,330
Yeah!

3133
03:44:09,310 --> 03:44:10,290
That was good!

3134
03:44:10,390 --> 03:44:10,650
No!

3135
03:44:11,750 --> 03:44:13,230
That was good, no?

3136
03:44:14,990 --> 03:44:16,310
That was awesome!

3137
03:44:17,410 --> 03:44:19,350
I did that, I did that.

3138
03:44:20,710 --> 03:44:23,150
Micmac for TwinkleDogsChart 2.

3139
03:44:23,790 --> 03:44:27,810
I might be down.

3140
03:44:28,190 --> 03:44:28,890
I'm not down.

3141
03:44:29,550 --> 03:44:30,230
I'm still good.

3142
03:44:34,310 --> 03:44:35,610
Almost there!

3143
03:44:36,850 --> 03:44:37,650
I

3144
03:44:45,550 --> 03:44:46,710
want the finishing hit.

3145
03:44:48,850 --> 03:44:53,630
Let me finish her.

3146
03:44:55,490 --> 03:44:57,010
Let me finish her.

3147
03:44:57,970 --> 03:44:59,090
Let me finish her.

3148
03:45:00,970 --> 03:45:01,970
Get off of me!

3149
03:45:18,030 --> 03:45:18,830
Shamed!

3150
03:45:18,970 --> 03:45:19,210
No!

3151
03:45:24,190 --> 03:45:25,230
Thank you

3152
03:45:42,340 --> 03:45:44,540
for the... You really didn't have to say that.

3153
03:45:44,640 --> 03:45:45,480
I feel so bad.

3154
03:45:50,220 --> 03:45:51,300
You killed it!

3155
03:45:51,380 --> 03:45:52,240
You crushed it!

3156
03:45:53,400 --> 03:45:54,460
Like a bug.

3157
03:45:54,960 --> 03:45:56,080
Like a pupa.

3158
03:46:01,240 --> 03:46:04,720
And now we have to do it three more times?

3159
03:46:05,260 --> 03:46:07,460
At least we don't have to do that fight again.

3160
03:46:07,580 --> 03:46:08,020
Thank goodness.

3161
03:46:08,020 --> 03:46:09,300
No more pupa!

3162
03:46:12,440 --> 03:46:14,260
The battle was so fast.

3163
03:46:14,820 --> 03:46:15,920
Also red costumes.

3164
03:46:18,200 --> 03:46:18,760
Again!

3165
03:46:23,460 --> 03:46:24,960
Cocoon will be the worst.

3166
03:46:25,780 --> 03:46:27,180
Do we also have to do Peace Walker?

3167
03:46:34,940 --> 03:46:35,500
Yes!

3168
03:46:38,840 --> 03:46:40,860
Guys, eye on the prize.

3169
03:46:41,080 --> 03:46:44,700
There is a man in a speedo waiting for us.

3170
03:46:47,420 --> 03:46:48,260
He...

3171
03:46:49,020 --> 03:46:50,980
He is waiting for us.

3172
03:46:58,450 --> 03:47:00,030
Eye on the prize.

3173
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:07,410
How do I unlock the human... the human torch?

3174
03:47:07,410 --> 03:47:07,910
Oh!

3175
03:47:15,780 --> 03:47:16,860
I missed the tape.

3176
03:47:16,940 --> 03:47:17,500
What are you talking about?

3177
03:47:21,650 --> 03:47:22,690
What did I miss?

3178
03:47:39,530 --> 03:47:40,950
Hold the pause... Oh!

3179
03:47:42,790 --> 03:47:43,710
Oh, sorry.

3180
03:47:45,990 --> 03:47:47,110
Oh, sorry.

3181
03:47:47,270 --> 03:47:48,890
I completely forgot about it.

3182
03:47:53,390 --> 03:47:56,530
Hot blondes and triple agents within your mother base.

3183
03:47:57,430 --> 03:47:57,910
My bad.

3184
03:47:57,990 --> 03:47:58,490
Sorry guys.

3185
03:48:00,730 --> 03:48:01,450
It's OK.

3186
03:48:03,050 --> 03:48:04,550
I don't think we have to do it.

3187
03:48:09,000 --> 03:48:09,480
Yeah!

3188
03:48:12,260 --> 03:48:13,240
Alright, Micmac.

3189
03:48:14,240 --> 03:48:15,680
Trusting on you part 2.

3190
03:48:23,020 --> 03:48:27,420
When I join 2, I've got the max level M47 rank 5.

3191
03:48:29,340 --> 03:48:31,960
I can't tell if you're being serious or not, Lambda.

3192
03:48:33,100 --> 03:48:34,980
I can't tell if you're being serious.

3193
03:48:35,460 --> 03:48:37,960
If you could join, why didn't you...

3194
03:48:42,990 --> 03:48:44,530
Why didn't you ever join?

3195
03:48:50,660 --> 03:48:52,400
This feels suspicious.

3196
03:48:55,460 --> 03:48:58,260
I wanna join Minky Room, but I'm from Southeast Asia.

3197
03:48:59,500 --> 03:49:01,440
And the same people keep joining...

3198
03:49:06,170 --> 03:49:07,610
Yeah, do you have the slingshot?

3199
03:49:07,930 --> 03:49:09,030
I wanna see the slingshot.

3200
03:49:21,440 --> 03:49:22,340
I wanna see internet.

3201
03:49:27,430 --> 03:49:29,210
Let Lambda in.

3202
03:49:31,010 --> 03:49:32,810
Let Lambda in!

3203
03:49:42,460 --> 03:49:44,040
Just let someone named Sukuna join.

3204
03:49:44,320 --> 03:49:45,120
Sukuna join!

3205
03:49:45,620 --> 03:49:46,720
Let nobody else join!

3206
03:49:51,310 --> 03:49:53,030
Aw, Brooks, thank you.

3207
03:49:53,290 --> 03:49:56,130
I will remove the bandana and quit my rations.

3208
03:49:56,470 --> 03:49:56,550
OK.

3209
03:49:59,710 --> 03:50:01,170
Oh no, no, wait!

3210
03:50:05,110 --> 03:50:06,190
Lambda, do you wanna join?

3211
03:50:06,250 --> 03:50:07,650
You can join, like right now.

3212
03:50:07,910 --> 03:50:10,570
This is... Everybody is being so nice to you.

3213
03:50:28,760 --> 03:50:29,500
Let's go!

3214
03:50:30,580 --> 03:50:31,680
What am I playing on?

3215
03:50:31,680 --> 03:50:32,620
I'm playing on Xbox.

3216
03:50:35,580 --> 03:50:36,020
Alright.

3217
03:50:44,630 --> 03:50:45,950
Also, Petman, I'm so sorry.

3218
03:50:48,790 --> 03:50:50,870
I saw your dono just now.

3219
03:50:51,110 --> 03:50:52,410
MGSV time, yay!

3220
03:50:55,730 --> 03:50:57,190
OK, are we going?

3221
03:50:58,870 --> 03:51:01,190
Oh wait, let me equip more food.

3222
03:51:01,330 --> 03:51:01,830
I'm stupid.

3223
03:51:02,650 --> 03:51:05,450
I have no more of these rations.

3224
03:51:11,550 --> 03:51:13,550
Wait, can I equip this ration too?

3225
03:51:13,990 --> 03:51:15,130
Yeah, OK, good, good, good.

3226
03:51:15,130 --> 03:51:17,170
OK, now ration and the curry.

3227
03:51:17,310 --> 03:51:18,050
OK, OK, OK.

3228
03:51:23,750 --> 03:51:26,290
OK, I'm good.

3229
03:51:26,570 --> 03:51:27,530
That was the cooked ration.

3230
03:51:27,710 --> 03:51:29,730
Yeah, yeah, I ran out.

3231
03:51:31,990 --> 03:51:35,990
Yeah, thank you guys so much for being so courteous.

3232
03:51:36,550 --> 03:51:38,910
Oh wait, OK, I have the FIM.

3233
03:51:39,630 --> 03:51:41,510
We don't really need the strike marker, but that's OK.

3234
03:51:43,630 --> 03:51:44,370
OK, I'm ready!

3235
03:51:51,710 --> 03:51:52,930
Let's go baby.

3236
03:51:54,330 --> 03:51:55,750
Let's go baby.

3237
03:52:02,110 --> 03:52:02,790
Yes.

3238
03:52:06,580 --> 03:52:07,740
Good luck.

3239
03:52:09,680 --> 03:52:13,140
Eye on the prize, eye on the prize, eye on the prize, eye on the prize.

3240
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:15,100
I'm just thinking about it.

3241
03:52:15,760 --> 03:52:17,480
Thinking about it.

3242
03:52:18,060 --> 03:52:21,640
I'm thinking about it, I'm thinking about it, I'm thinking about it.

3243
03:52:23,220 --> 03:52:25,960
Getting an airstrike on a flying boss would be a real flex.

3244
03:52:26,080 --> 03:52:26,600
I agree.

3245
03:52:27,460 --> 03:52:29,200
There is a chance.

3246
03:52:29,540 --> 03:52:31,690
There are some points where he gets pretty low, but...

3247
03:52:35,480 --> 03:52:36,920
Sukuna said 5 minutes.

3248
03:52:37,060 --> 03:52:37,640
Are we timing?

3249
03:52:38,580 --> 03:52:38,900
Yeah.

3250
03:52:41,040 --> 03:52:41,580
Time!

3251
03:52:43,960 --> 03:52:44,500
Time!

3252
03:52:50,290 --> 03:52:51,550
No one is exempt!

3253
03:52:53,290 --> 03:52:56,910
I'm in the back and I'm soaking!

3254
03:53:04,990 --> 03:53:09,710
This one is tricky just because he is so all over the place.

3255
03:53:10,670 --> 03:53:11,570
We got this, easy.

3256
03:53:12,590 --> 03:53:13,670
No worries.

3257
03:53:14,310 --> 03:53:15,750
5 minutes starting!

3258
03:53:20,830 --> 03:53:21,430
No!

3259
03:53:23,090 --> 03:53:23,690
No!

3260
03:53:51,130 --> 03:53:52,410
Did that shoot?

3261
03:53:52,690 --> 03:53:53,470
I don't know if that hit.

3262
03:53:56,840 --> 03:53:58,720
Chrysalis is so cool looking though.

3263
03:54:05,370 --> 03:54:06,470
Where are they landing?

3264
03:54:08,230 --> 03:54:09,170
Over there.

3265
03:54:10,010 --> 03:54:17,410
I guess it doesn't really matter where we...

3266
03:54:24,430 --> 03:54:25,990
You got this.

3267
03:54:27,530 --> 03:54:28,290
I believe.

3268
03:54:28,290 --> 03:54:30,210
We got this!

3269
03:54:30,330 --> 03:54:33,970
Wow, we already done like a pretty sizable amount.

3270
03:54:36,350 --> 03:54:36,910
Really?

3271
03:54:36,910 --> 03:54:38,610
Wow, did you see that dodge?

3272
03:54:40,850 --> 03:54:42,710
I want to do the human slingshot.

3273
03:54:47,830 --> 03:54:50,470
I want to do the human slingshot.

3274
03:54:52,550 --> 03:54:52,930
Oh my god.

3275
03:54:54,430 --> 03:54:55,170
Bit back!

3276
03:54:56,170 --> 03:54:57,390
I can't stop it.

3277
03:54:57,570 --> 03:54:58,890
I can't stop it from happening.

3278
03:54:59,030 --> 03:54:59,670
Just let it happen.

3279
03:55:01,790 --> 03:55:02,890
Just let it happen.

3280
03:55:04,290 --> 03:55:05,850
That's because I'm out of stuff.

3281
03:55:06,030 --> 03:55:06,290
Sorry.

3282
03:55:07,170 --> 03:55:07,930
It's my fault.

3283
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:16,140
Stupid kidnappers are so annoying.

3284
03:55:19,860 --> 03:55:21,040
Damn, that was not good.

3285
03:55:25,440 --> 03:55:27,240
I keep missing.

3286
03:55:41,740 --> 03:55:42,840
Oh shoot.

3287
03:55:47,390 --> 03:55:50,690
You need at least one component to develop a part of the slingshot.

3288
03:55:52,430 --> 03:55:54,050
Obtainable hunting monsters.

3289
03:55:54,350 --> 03:55:55,570
I see.

3290
03:55:58,090 --> 03:56:00,050
There's got to be someone who has it.

3291
03:56:00,230 --> 03:56:00,310
No!

3292
03:56:01,410 --> 03:56:03,410
There's got to be someone who has it.

3293
03:56:12,900 --> 03:56:14,060
How did you hit it?

3294
03:56:14,140 --> 03:56:15,300
I'm just that good, baby.

3295
03:56:16,140 --> 03:56:17,760
I'm just that good.

3296
03:56:20,400 --> 03:56:24,140
That's not for me.

3297
03:56:31,700 --> 03:56:33,300
That was close.

3298
03:56:52,960 --> 03:56:53,500
She's normal.

3299
03:56:53,640 --> 03:56:54,040
She's normal.

3300
03:56:56,440 --> 03:56:57,320
She's normal.

3301
03:56:57,860 --> 03:56:58,340
Damn it.

3302
03:57:10,690 --> 03:57:11,450
Where is she?

3303
03:57:12,570 --> 03:57:14,070
Good job, Trip!

3304
03:57:34,010 --> 03:57:35,730
Four minutes?

3305
03:57:38,750 --> 03:57:40,430
Oops, I guess I died.

3306
03:57:40,890 --> 03:57:42,610
Oops, I guess I died.

3307
03:57:43,130 --> 03:57:46,770
Oops, I guess I died.

3308
03:57:48,990 --> 03:57:49,850
Yo!

3309
03:57:51,070 --> 03:57:53,990
Lambda was so legit.

3310
03:57:55,830 --> 03:57:56,190
Go!

3311
03:57:56,290 --> 03:57:56,670
Go in!

3312
03:57:56,730 --> 03:57:57,070
Go in!

3313
03:57:57,150 --> 03:57:57,470
Go in!

3314
03:57:57,950 --> 03:57:58,230
Go in!

3315
03:57:58,270 --> 03:57:59,030
Go in!

3316
03:58:22,300 --> 03:58:22,660
Tape!

3317
03:58:22,780 --> 03:58:23,660
I will this time.

3318
03:58:24,140 --> 03:58:25,480
Before I was distracted.

3319
03:58:29,120 --> 03:58:30,080
Good job, Micmac.

3320
03:58:30,200 --> 03:58:30,840
Good job, Lambda.

3321
03:58:33,320 --> 03:58:34,980
You guys were great!

3322
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:38,040
And of course Silver, you too.

3323
03:58:38,600 --> 03:58:39,720
We were just there.

3324
03:58:40,280 --> 03:58:42,680
We were just, you know...

3325
03:58:49,100 --> 03:58:49,600
Thanks!

3326
03:58:52,020 --> 03:58:54,340
You and I are probably in the same category.

3327
03:58:55,160 --> 03:58:56,060
Just being there.

3328
03:59:03,940 --> 03:59:09,340
We were just pinching it while they were punching it.

3329
03:59:09,340 --> 03:59:14,680
We were pinching it like...

3330
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:28,860
When does it come up?

3331
03:59:32,820 --> 03:59:33,200
Oops.

3332
03:59:45,650 --> 03:59:47,070
I didn't see it.

3333
03:59:51,160 --> 03:59:53,560
When I'm moving I didn't see it though.

3334
04:00:05,770 --> 04:00:07,230
I couldn't get it this time.

3335
04:00:07,450 --> 04:00:07,810
That's OK.

3336
04:00:19,420 --> 04:00:20,260
I see.

3337
04:00:20,440 --> 04:00:20,620
I see.

3338
04:00:22,020 --> 04:00:22,900
Next time.

3339
04:00:24,760 --> 04:00:25,940
I say it again.

3340
04:00:26,640 --> 04:00:27,560
Next time.

3341
04:00:27,640 --> 04:00:29,140
We'll get them next time again.

3342
04:00:29,700 --> 04:00:30,180
And again.

3343
04:00:31,100 --> 04:00:31,640
And again.

3344
04:00:32,640 --> 04:00:33,880
And again.

3345
04:00:37,020 --> 04:00:37,640
Alright.

3346
04:00:39,480 --> 04:00:40,920
That's two down.

3347
04:00:55,790 --> 04:01:00,690
Oh my God.

3348
04:01:02,170 --> 04:01:03,430
Crazy.

3349
04:01:05,370 --> 04:01:06,630
Alrighty.

3350
04:01:08,530 --> 04:01:09,370
How many left?

3351
04:01:09,470 --> 04:01:11,350
I believe there are just two more left.

3352
04:01:21,310 --> 04:01:21,790
Cocoon.

3353
04:01:23,030 --> 04:01:23,510
Finally!

3354
04:01:23,770 --> 04:01:25,870
You can count on me again if you want, Buzz!

3355
04:01:25,870 --> 04:01:27,170
Lambda, you killed it!

3356
04:01:27,370 --> 04:01:27,690
Literally!

3357
04:01:29,910 --> 04:01:30,390
Literally.

3358
04:01:33,470 --> 04:01:34,530
So yeah, Cocoon.

3359
04:01:35,490 --> 04:01:36,190
Peace Walker.

3360
04:01:37,110 --> 04:01:37,710
That's it.

3361
04:01:39,450 --> 04:01:42,910
Do I have to do the Peace Walker Type 2 to unlock the Cocoon?

3362
04:01:42,910 --> 04:01:44,670
I might have to, huh?

3363
04:01:45,830 --> 04:01:46,530
Oh shoot.

3364
04:01:47,230 --> 04:01:49,150
Wait, do we have to do Peace Walker Type 2?

3365
04:01:59,700 --> 04:02:02,480
Let's see if it shows up after Cocoon Custom.

3366
04:02:07,760 --> 04:02:08,440
Thank you.

3367
04:02:10,060 --> 04:02:10,900
Hey Leo!

3368
04:02:11,080 --> 04:02:12,920
What are you doing taking my spot, eh?

3369
04:02:13,500 --> 04:02:13,980
OK.

3370
04:02:21,140 --> 04:02:23,540
How much curry and stuff do I have?

3371
04:02:25,320 --> 04:02:26,520
I guess enough.

3372
04:02:28,220 --> 04:02:29,320
I guess enough.

3373
04:02:31,140 --> 04:02:31,540
OK.

3374
04:02:33,500 --> 04:02:35,960
Pretty sure you have to beat Type 2 to unlock Custom.

3375
04:02:36,080 --> 04:02:36,560
We'll see!

3376
04:02:38,180 --> 04:02:41,140
We have to do this fight anyway, so...

3377
04:02:45,500 --> 04:02:47,080
Who did we lose?

3378
04:02:57,520 --> 04:02:58,620
Oh, there you go.

3379
04:03:02,510 --> 04:03:03,250
Let's go!

3380
04:03:10,280 --> 04:03:12,780
Let's try not to have this one be another half hour.

3381
04:03:15,160 --> 04:03:16,120
Please God!

3382
04:03:16,920 --> 04:03:19,600
Please have this one go by quickly, please!

3383
04:03:20,480 --> 04:03:21,720
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

3384
04:03:23,700 --> 04:03:24,180
Please.

3385
04:03:24,180 --> 04:03:24,800
Please.

3386
04:03:29,540 --> 04:03:31,500
McMac, we're all counting on you.

3387
04:03:31,540 --> 04:03:32,080
You know that.

3388
04:03:32,560 --> 04:03:34,240
No pressure or anything.

3389
04:03:35,020 --> 04:03:36,720
No pressure or anything.

3390
04:03:43,580 --> 04:03:45,100
No pressure.

3391
04:03:46,400 --> 04:03:47,700
No pressure.

3392
04:03:48,860 --> 04:03:49,540
No pressure.

3393
04:03:51,900 --> 04:03:52,700
What I ate.

3394
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:54,440
I was so sleepy before.

3395
04:04:13,920 --> 04:04:15,460
I won't this time.

3396
04:04:16,380 --> 04:04:17,060
You won't what?

3397
04:04:23,380 --> 04:04:25,360
Eating only made you more sleepy.

3398
04:04:25,860 --> 04:04:26,240
Oh no!

3399
04:04:29,500 --> 04:04:31,500
I got stuff I gotta do after this.

3400
04:04:32,120 --> 04:04:33,600
But it's already been four hours.

3401
04:04:34,360 --> 04:04:36,200
I don't know if I'll be able to finish my stuff.

3402
04:04:36,540 --> 04:04:36,820
No!

3403
04:04:38,800 --> 04:04:39,320
OK.

3404
04:04:39,320 --> 04:04:41,300
But it's for the mission.

3405
04:04:41,480 --> 04:04:43,300
This is our last time playing.

3406
04:04:44,600 --> 04:04:46,680
Peace Walker, we gotta get the date.

3407
04:04:48,400 --> 04:04:50,260
It's important to me.

3408
04:04:51,260 --> 04:04:53,040
Because I've never been able to do it on my own.

3409
04:04:53,060 --> 04:04:54,340
I've never been able to get it.

3410
04:05:04,030 --> 04:05:05,550
I'm gonna work on the guns.

3411
04:05:43,860 --> 04:05:44,620
Just kidding.

3412
04:05:47,820 --> 04:05:48,840
Note to self.

3413
04:05:49,320 --> 04:05:50,720
Give a little bit more room.

3414
04:06:00,080 --> 04:06:00,960
Stop it!

3415
04:06:01,100 --> 04:06:03,420
OK, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

3416
04:06:05,680 --> 04:06:06,980
Yeah, you're welcome McMac.

3417
04:06:07,060 --> 04:06:09,100
It was completely targeted on me.

3418
04:06:17,740 --> 04:06:19,560
What if I do a strike marker here?

3419
04:06:27,240 --> 04:06:27,680
It's

3420
04:06:45,080 --> 04:06:46,740
already like so...

3421
04:06:51,140 --> 04:06:51,440
Yeah!

3422
04:06:58,600 --> 04:06:58,900
Don't

3423
04:07:21,680 --> 04:07:22,340
worry about me.

3424
04:07:22,440 --> 04:07:24,120
I'm just a little dead under...

3425
04:07:33,760 --> 04:07:35,440
Everybody is so used to me being dead.

3426
04:07:35,540 --> 04:07:36,060
They are like what?

3427
04:07:41,020 --> 04:07:41,320
What?

3428
04:07:53,670 --> 04:07:54,470
Don't come in here.

3429
04:07:54,610 --> 04:07:55,330
Do not come in here.

3430
04:07:55,410 --> 04:07:55,790
There we go.

3431
04:07:56,530 --> 04:07:56,970
There we go.

3432
04:07:57,050 --> 04:07:57,610
Nice, nice, nice.

3433
04:07:57,610 --> 04:07:59,350
Get McMac first!

3434
04:07:59,930 --> 04:08:02,890
Yeah, I kind of wish he got me first.

3435
04:08:05,390 --> 04:08:10,250
Wait, now I feel a little upset that I wasn't prioritized.

3436
04:08:24,860 --> 04:08:27,700
A little self... OK, you can't get the wheels.

3437
04:08:27,880 --> 04:08:28,560
They don't do anything.

3438
04:08:42,860 --> 04:08:43,380
Nice.

3439
04:08:43,380 --> 04:08:43,440
Nice.

3440
04:08:46,520 --> 04:08:47,900
Oh my gosh.

3441
04:08:50,140 --> 04:08:51,720
I can't stop getting hit.

3442
04:09:04,450 --> 04:09:06,790
How did I make it?

3443
04:09:09,930 --> 04:09:11,230
Gotta hit the vents.

3444
04:09:12,890 --> 04:09:14,330
Oh wait, that didn't do anything.

3445
04:09:14,510 --> 04:09:15,010
Or did it?

3446
04:09:16,190 --> 04:09:16,610
Let's see.

3447
04:09:19,470 --> 04:09:19,970
No,

3448
04:09:33,090 --> 04:09:34,070
I'm not doing another strike.

3449
04:09:34,070 --> 04:09:34,430
I'm out.

3450
04:09:39,680 --> 04:09:41,420
Well, the vents are done, maybe.

3451
04:09:49,880 --> 04:09:51,660
Give me my curry, please!

3452
04:10:11,280 --> 04:10:12,340
Use the ladder.

3453
04:10:13,440 --> 04:10:15,100
I'm trying to stop it, Leo!

3454
04:10:19,320 --> 04:10:20,580
Stinking chainsaw thing.

3455
04:10:20,960 --> 04:10:22,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3456
04:10:32,400 --> 04:10:33,760
Random Rathalos boy.

3457
04:10:33,840 --> 04:10:34,560
I know, it's so funny.

3458
04:10:41,440 --> 04:10:42,140
Let's go.

3459
04:10:42,920 --> 04:10:44,120
Use the ladder.

3460
04:10:44,120 --> 04:10:44,180
Use the ladder.

3461
04:10:44,620 --> 04:10:45,680
He's so funny.

3462
04:10:46,960 --> 04:10:48,700
He sounds so done.

3463
04:10:48,780 --> 04:10:50,040
He's like, use the ladder.

3464
04:11:07,280 --> 04:11:07,960
I'll go up now.

3465
04:11:08,080 --> 04:11:09,460
Micmac, you're killing it!

3466
04:11:10,180 --> 04:11:11,900
Leo, you're killing it!

3467
04:11:13,660 --> 04:11:15,400
Illunstoppable, you're killing it!

3468
04:11:15,540 --> 04:11:16,880
Everyone's doing so good.

3469
04:11:25,590 --> 04:11:26,130
Wait!

3470
04:11:27,010 --> 04:11:27,270
Wait!

3471
04:11:27,510 --> 04:11:27,910
Stop!

3472
04:11:28,110 --> 04:11:29,050
Wait, wait, wait!

3473
04:11:31,870 --> 04:11:32,870
Wait, wait, wait!

3474
04:11:33,510 --> 04:11:34,750
Wait, wait, wait!

3475
04:11:36,150 --> 04:11:37,070
I'm coming!

3476
04:11:49,700 --> 04:11:51,380
6 minutes 28 seconds.

3477
04:11:52,760 --> 04:11:54,640
That was sub 8.

3478
04:11:54,820 --> 04:11:55,680
That was sub 8.

3479
04:12:10,880 --> 04:12:11,480
Okay.

3480
04:12:12,080 --> 04:12:14,240
One, maybe... One or two, we'll see.

3481
04:12:16,080 --> 04:12:17,420
One or two.

3482
04:12:18,260 --> 04:12:19,020
We'll see.

3483
04:12:19,180 --> 04:12:20,360
One or two more fights.

3484
04:12:25,500 --> 04:12:25,940
Okay.

3485
04:12:27,220 --> 04:12:28,320
I pressed it!

3486
04:12:28,400 --> 04:12:29,060
I got it!

3487
04:12:33,180 --> 04:12:34,020
I did it!

3488
04:12:44,350 --> 04:12:45,890
There's so much in this game.

3489
04:12:46,150 --> 04:12:47,510
God, there's so much in this game.

3490
04:12:52,410 --> 04:12:54,010
Mosquito data is as good as ours!

3491
04:13:00,910 --> 04:13:01,710
I know.

3492
04:13:01,910 --> 04:13:03,410
Yeah, the tape was humongous.

3493
04:13:05,410 --> 04:13:07,170
I wish I had more sushi.

3494
04:13:09,330 --> 04:13:11,810
I ate most of it before streaming.

3495
04:13:13,070 --> 04:13:14,430
I wish I had more.

3496
04:13:21,910 --> 04:13:22,510
Not

3497
04:13:26,660 --> 04:13:27,560
enough sushi.

3498
04:13:28,420 --> 04:13:29,680
I want more sushi.

3499
04:13:30,420 --> 04:13:32,020
Eat track tape.

3500
04:13:35,400 --> 04:13:37,500
Am I going to try portable ops yet?

3501
04:13:37,880 --> 04:13:38,740
What do you mean yet?

3502
04:13:38,880 --> 04:13:40,280
I've played portable ops before.

3503
04:13:41,620 --> 04:13:43,300
But, I don't know.

3504
04:13:45,580 --> 04:13:49,100
As portable ops, I don't want to do the fight.

3505
04:13:49,560 --> 04:13:50,980
I don't want to do Gray Fox.

3506
04:13:52,040 --> 04:13:53,840
I hate that fight.

3507
04:13:54,900 --> 04:13:56,360
I hate fighting Gray Fox.

3508
04:14:11,150 --> 04:14:12,930
Let's go team!

3509
04:14:16,330 --> 04:14:19,230
You obtained Paws' Diary Part 1.

3510
04:14:19,290 --> 04:14:22,070
Let's listen to it real quick before we...

3511
04:14:23,750 --> 04:14:26,910
Before we continue.

3512
04:14:26,910 --> 04:14:27,050
Let's continue.

3513
04:14:35,820 --> 04:14:38,800
It's hard to go back to portable ops after Peak Walker.

3514
04:14:39,000 --> 04:14:39,520
I know!

3515
04:14:39,680 --> 04:14:40,760
It's true though.

3516
04:14:48,800 --> 04:14:54,180
To everybody who thinks that you need to do type 2 battle before getting custom...

3517
04:14:56,560 --> 04:14:57,760
You did not!

3518
04:14:58,540 --> 04:14:59,260
Nice!

3519
04:15:02,420 --> 04:15:04,100
One more battle!

3520
04:15:06,040 --> 04:15:07,480
Ok, wait.

3521
04:15:09,140 --> 04:15:10,040
Hold on.

3522
04:15:10,280 --> 04:15:16,200
I'm not going to do it, but I want to listen to the tape.

3523
04:15:36,400 --> 04:15:37,500
He's so efficient.

3524
04:16:07,140 --> 04:16:10,340
I love you

3525
04:16:14,320 --> 04:16:19,940
I love you I love you I love them

3526
04:16:31,340 --> 04:16:33,900
What is wrong with them?

3527
04:17:09,180 --> 04:17:12,660
That's ironic, huh?

3528
04:17:31,370 --> 04:17:32,230
Alright.

3529
04:17:32,610 --> 04:17:35,090
One more battle, huh?

3530
04:17:36,570 --> 04:17:37,090
McMurk!

3531
04:17:43,390 --> 04:17:44,170
Thank you!

3532
04:17:44,650 --> 04:17:45,630
Who's in there?

3533
04:17:48,310 --> 04:17:48,830
Clanky!

3534
04:17:50,990 --> 04:17:52,030
And Sapphire.

3535
04:17:52,410 --> 04:17:52,810
Okay.

3536
04:17:53,370 --> 04:17:55,050
Can I join this Peace Walker battle boss?

3537
04:17:55,170 --> 04:17:56,490
Oh, this one is pretty beefy.

3538
04:17:56,530 --> 04:17:57,630
You need a lot of firepower.

3539
04:17:59,130 --> 04:18:03,590
I think both Clanky and Sapphire have played before.

3540
04:18:04,630 --> 04:18:08,310
If anybody would like to give up their spot, anyone would be so kind.

3541
04:18:09,710 --> 04:18:10,590
Thank you!

3542
04:18:10,810 --> 04:18:11,790
Thanks, Clanky!

3543
04:18:12,270 --> 04:18:12,650
Sorry, Mint.

3544
04:18:12,690 --> 04:18:14,170
This one takes me 20 minutes solo.

3545
04:18:14,290 --> 04:18:14,730
It sucks.

3546
04:18:14,810 --> 04:18:15,030
Okay.

3547
04:18:16,070 --> 04:18:19,630
That's why I didn't want to do the Type 2 version.

3548
04:18:19,790 --> 04:18:22,270
Because I was like, already I feel that it would be...

3549
04:18:22,270 --> 04:18:23,270
Thank you!

3550
04:18:24,170 --> 04:18:24,610
Okay.

3551
04:18:25,450 --> 04:18:27,110
This is a toughie, guys.

3552
04:18:27,250 --> 04:18:28,150
This is a toughie.

3553
04:18:30,530 --> 04:18:32,290
Always happy to help a fellow Wisp.

3554
04:18:32,550 --> 04:18:33,310
Thank you!

3555
04:18:34,650 --> 04:18:35,470
I'm scared.

3556
04:18:35,570 --> 04:18:36,090
We got this.

3557
04:18:36,110 --> 04:18:36,730
We got this.

3558
04:18:36,750 --> 04:18:37,050
Alright.

3559
04:18:38,630 --> 04:18:39,190
Combat!

3560
04:18:39,650 --> 04:18:39,950
Combat!

3561
04:18:43,890 --> 04:18:44,910
I believe in us.

3562
04:18:44,990 --> 04:18:47,210
We got it so fast when we first did it.

3563
04:18:47,490 --> 04:18:49,510
So, this will be like a true final battle.

3564
04:18:51,190 --> 04:18:52,730
Eye on the prize!

3565
04:18:53,010 --> 04:18:54,250
Eye on the prize!

3566
04:18:57,110 --> 04:18:59,510
A girl worth fighting for.

3567
04:19:01,190 --> 04:19:03,910
I couldn't win this until I rank 5, Gustav.

3568
04:19:04,870 --> 04:19:05,430
Gosh.

3569
04:19:11,140 --> 04:19:11,900
Oh, hello?

3570
04:19:11,900 --> 04:19:11,980
Hello?

3571
04:19:14,200 --> 04:19:16,260
I think it's just a little bit slow.

3572
04:19:17,780 --> 04:19:19,480
I don't even know if I'll be able to do much.

3573
04:19:20,160 --> 04:19:21,140
But we got this.

3574
04:19:21,520 --> 04:19:22,160
You're bugged!

3575
04:19:22,660 --> 04:19:23,020
Wait.

3576
04:19:25,160 --> 04:19:26,060
No way.

3577
04:19:26,680 --> 04:19:27,580
Lambda can host.

3578
04:19:28,040 --> 04:19:28,220
Wait.

3579
04:19:29,900 --> 04:19:31,020
If you're...

3580
04:19:41,370 --> 04:19:44,070
Someone go play with combat drone.

3581
04:19:48,390 --> 04:19:49,950
Someone go play!

3582
04:20:04,950 --> 04:20:06,130
There's two people.

3583
04:20:06,230 --> 04:20:07,110
Oh there's three people!

3584
04:20:16,510 --> 04:20:19,430
Don't forget to let Lambda in, everybody.

3585
04:20:20,170 --> 04:20:21,490
Please be so kind.

3586
04:20:22,630 --> 04:20:23,550
Thank you, thank you.

3587
04:20:25,250 --> 04:20:26,370
Just so I would...

3588
04:20:26,370 --> 04:20:29,430
Just so that we can actually...

3589
04:20:30,610 --> 04:20:31,590
Get through it.

3590
04:20:34,550 --> 04:20:36,070
Is this the last?

3591
04:20:36,150 --> 04:20:37,610
It is the last!

3592
04:20:42,030 --> 04:20:43,030
Mobius, thank you.

3593
04:20:43,050 --> 04:20:43,630
I'm sorry.

3594
04:20:43,930 --> 04:20:44,090
Wait.

3595
04:20:45,950 --> 04:20:49,990
I completely ranked and grinded out PSP3 S3 file.

3596
04:20:50,830 --> 04:20:52,190
This one takes a while.

3597
04:20:53,070 --> 04:20:53,630
Okay.

3598
04:20:54,170 --> 04:20:55,090
Yeah, I would...

3599
04:20:56,010 --> 04:20:59,370
For any of the other fights, you know, anybody could join.

3600
04:20:59,450 --> 04:21:02,090
But for these ones, we need people who are like...

3601
04:21:02,870 --> 04:21:06,750
Who have ranked up their stuff a lot, so...

3602
04:21:06,750 --> 04:21:07,350
I apologize.

3603
04:21:11,760 --> 04:21:12,460
We're in.

3604
04:21:13,800 --> 04:21:14,100
No

3605
04:21:17,390 --> 04:21:17,670
problem.

3606
04:21:17,930 --> 04:21:18,550
Thank you.

3607
04:21:19,630 --> 04:21:22,470
Yeah, we got to get S rank wisps.

3608
04:21:24,890 --> 04:21:27,890
You can't argue with five red skulls.

3609
04:21:27,970 --> 04:21:28,270
I know.

3610
04:21:28,430 --> 04:21:30,390
I shouldn't even be in here.

3611
04:21:31,810 --> 04:21:33,650
I don't belong here.

3612
04:21:45,540 --> 04:21:47,640
Lambda, you might need a host.

3613
04:21:51,860 --> 04:21:54,240
Combat...Someone play with combat drones!

3614
04:22:01,530 --> 04:22:04,170
Please, we're on the final battle.

3615
04:22:04,310 --> 04:22:04,610
Please!

3616
04:22:09,510 --> 04:22:14,160
I wonder if I can even get in.

3617
04:22:16,140 --> 04:22:17,100
I'm in!

3618
04:22:27,530 --> 04:22:28,150
Okay.

3619
04:22:29,850 --> 04:22:30,830
We're good to go then?

3620
04:22:46,630 --> 04:22:47,910
Do we need a Mic Mac?

3621
04:22:48,730 --> 04:22:51,630
Sapphire, how good is your stuff?

3622
04:22:55,550 --> 04:22:56,770
Are you like full Mac?

3623
04:22:57,010 --> 04:22:57,950
Full ranked up?

3624
04:23:10,720 --> 04:23:12,940
If they have it unlocked, they probably have good stuff though.

3625
04:23:14,180 --> 04:23:14,580
What?

3626
04:23:14,720 --> 04:23:15,320
Full Mac?

3627
04:23:15,700 --> 04:23:15,960
What?

3628
04:23:16,120 --> 04:23:16,740
Did I say that?

3629
04:23:17,020 --> 04:23:17,900
Oh, my bad.

3630
04:23:18,120 --> 04:23:18,140
Sorry.

3631
04:23:20,220 --> 04:23:21,100
Full Mac...

3632
04:23:23,280 --> 04:23:26,640
I'm at full maxed.

3633
04:23:26,760 --> 04:23:28,000
I messed up.

3634
04:23:28,100 --> 04:23:29,440
I'm at full maxed.

3635
04:23:33,920 --> 04:23:35,340
It's all good, Vic Boss.

3636
04:23:35,400 --> 04:23:36,660
Okay, I guess we'll go then.

3637
04:23:39,100 --> 04:23:40,340
I don't see them in the chat.

3638
04:23:42,240 --> 04:23:43,320
Mac and cheese.

3639
04:23:50,000 --> 04:23:51,900
Can I get a full Mac?

3640
04:23:54,360 --> 04:23:59,320
The big Mac becoming...it makes you full, you know?

3641
04:24:06,230 --> 04:24:07,090
Let's go!

3642
04:24:09,050 --> 04:24:12,250
I'm full Mac on PSP, PS3.

3643
04:24:12,390 --> 04:24:13,130
What do you mean?

3644
04:24:14,610 --> 04:24:18,170
People who are stuck in the iOS system are full Mac.

3645
04:24:31,270 --> 04:24:32,350
Let's go, baby.

3646
04:24:36,610 --> 04:24:37,670
I'm scared.

3647
04:24:38,410 --> 04:24:39,450
This one is hard.

3648
04:24:39,690 --> 04:24:40,570
This one is so crazy.

3649
04:24:41,150 --> 04:24:41,770
I'm scared.

3650
04:24:48,210 --> 04:24:49,150
Strange love.

3651
04:24:49,250 --> 04:24:50,110
She's so hot.

3652
04:24:50,510 --> 04:24:51,970
Save me, beautiful woman.

3653
04:24:52,070 --> 04:24:52,670
Save me.

3654
04:24:53,030 --> 04:24:54,430
Save me, hot lady.

3655
04:24:55,710 --> 04:24:57,590
What's she got in her pocket there?

3656
04:24:58,250 --> 04:24:59,330
A little red something.

3657
04:25:00,930 --> 04:25:01,530
Cecile.

3658
04:25:01,530 --> 04:25:04,010
I wish Cecile was never heard from again.

3659
04:25:07,570 --> 04:25:09,710
Cecile came and she went.

3660
04:25:10,390 --> 04:25:11,170
Goodbye, Cecile.

3661
04:25:17,430 --> 04:25:18,030
I

3662
04:25:26,600 --> 04:25:29,680
was about to say I could swap, but I didn't type in time.

3663
04:25:31,000 --> 04:25:32,020
It's ok.

3664
04:25:32,200 --> 04:25:33,220
Let's do our best.

3665
04:25:36,320 --> 04:25:38,060
We got this.

3666
04:25:39,020 --> 04:25:40,360
Thank you so much for the loot.

3667
04:25:40,960 --> 04:25:41,600
Thank you.

3668
04:25:46,940 --> 04:25:48,980
I know the beauty mark.

3669
04:25:56,770 --> 04:26:00,010
Is she...Is Peace Walker just tanky?

3670
04:26:01,710 --> 04:26:02,550
Or...

3671
04:26:02,550 --> 04:26:03,150
Everything.

3672
04:26:03,410 --> 04:26:03,930
I'm scared.

3673
04:26:04,130 --> 04:26:04,910
I'm scared!

3674
04:26:10,890 --> 04:26:12,290
Extremely.

3675
04:26:12,430 --> 04:26:14,370
Extremely tanky.

3676
04:26:14,730 --> 04:26:15,870
Very tanky.

3677
04:26:52,390 --> 04:26:54,630
Red Peace Walker is too cute.

3678
04:26:55,450 --> 04:26:56,930
So stinking cute.

3679
04:27:18,400 --> 04:27:20,400
Where are you going?

3680
04:27:34,480 --> 04:27:36,920
Maybe I can get her from in here.

3681
04:27:43,500 --> 04:27:44,940
She's so choppy.

3682
04:27:55,300 --> 04:27:56,600
Initializing nothing.

3683
04:27:58,020 --> 04:27:59,600
Try this on for size.

3684
04:28:02,470 --> 04:28:04,140
I wasn't even trying to hide.

3685
04:28:06,220 --> 04:28:09,320
I thought I wasn't going to get it.

3686
04:28:20,740 --> 04:28:23,100
I'll try this on for size.

3687
04:28:24,160 --> 04:28:25,920
We are already halfway there.

3688
04:28:27,760 --> 04:28:29,060
This is crazy.

3689
04:28:31,440 --> 04:28:32,440
What are those?

3690
04:28:35,680 --> 04:28:39,020
It just dug into the ground.

3691
04:29:02,040 --> 04:29:02,440
Thank you.

3692
04:29:03,060 --> 04:29:03,060
Thank you.

3693
04:29:03,060 --> 04:29:03,260
Thank you.

3694
04:29:06,500 --> 04:29:07,300
Thank you.

3695
04:29:18,790 --> 04:29:19,810
Where are you?

3696
04:29:23,070 --> 04:29:24,790
You guys are making great time.

3697
04:29:24,870 --> 04:29:25,450
For real.

3698
04:29:35,350 --> 04:29:36,230
Oh shoot.

3699
04:29:39,010 --> 04:29:39,590
Wait.

3700
04:29:40,570 --> 04:29:40,730
What?

3701
04:29:41,250 --> 04:29:44,510
The counter disappeared

3702
04:30:02,010 --> 04:30:03,050
so I think we are ok.

3703
04:30:04,870 --> 04:30:05,890
Bring it on!

3704
04:30:13,070 --> 04:30:13,630
No!

3705
04:30:14,090 --> 04:30:14,650
Don't do that!

3706
04:30:20,590 --> 04:30:20,770
No!

3707
04:30:21,330 --> 04:30:21,610
Ok.

3708
04:30:25,490 --> 04:30:25,790
Ok.

3709
04:30:25,930 --> 04:30:26,170
Ok.

3710
04:30:26,450 --> 04:30:26,850
Alright.

3711
04:30:26,950 --> 04:30:27,190
Nice.

3712
04:30:27,290 --> 04:30:27,450
Nice.

3713
04:30:27,590 --> 04:30:27,830
Nice.

3714
04:30:45,580 --> 04:30:47,180
Oh my god!

3715
04:30:47,280 --> 04:30:48,540
Not the flame BB!

3716
04:30:49,560 --> 04:30:50,140
No!

3717
04:30:50,320 --> 04:30:51,750
The flame BB is too...

3718
04:30:52,360 --> 04:30:54,840
Oh shoot.

3719
04:30:55,200 --> 04:30:55,560
Please.

3720
04:30:56,280 --> 04:30:56,940
Hang it up.

3721
04:31:07,330 --> 04:31:07,910
I'm

3722
04:31:11,100 --> 04:31:11,500
going to die.

3723
04:31:11,600 --> 04:31:12,740
I'm actually doing so...

3724
04:31:12,740 --> 04:31:14,820
I'm totally fine actually.

3725
04:31:16,100 --> 04:31:21,480
I want to just get in on the action before we, you know, destroy her.

3726
04:31:26,320 --> 04:31:26,960
Mobius!

3727
04:31:27,100 --> 04:31:27,800
Don't die!

3728
04:31:28,760 --> 04:31:30,140
Oh shoot.

3729
04:31:30,880 --> 04:31:31,360
Oh my gosh.

3730
04:31:31,440 --> 04:31:32,680
I almost died there.

3731
04:31:40,040 --> 04:31:42,240
Get up snake please!

3732
04:31:42,620 --> 04:31:43,260
Snake!

3733
04:31:43,960 --> 04:31:44,760
This is so lame.

3734
04:31:44,880 --> 04:31:46,340
Am I going to be...

3735
04:31:46,340 --> 04:31:48,060
I'm going to be... Wait!

3736
04:31:48,200 --> 04:31:49,460
I want to shoot!

3737
04:31:49,940 --> 04:31:50,740
I'm ok.

3738
04:31:51,180 --> 04:31:51,640
Thank you.

3739
04:31:52,220 --> 04:31:55,160
I want to at least get in a final hit!

3740
04:31:57,780 --> 04:31:59,800
One of the final hits!

3741
04:32:00,800 --> 04:32:01,680
A final hit!

3742
04:32:28,450 --> 04:32:29,810
How do you get in?

3743
04:32:30,050 --> 04:32:30,570
Oh here we go.

3744
04:32:33,010 --> 04:32:33,570
I'm in!

3745
04:32:37,010 --> 04:32:37,990
Wow!

3746
04:32:38,110 --> 04:32:38,290
Team!

3747
04:32:43,430 --> 04:32:49,010
Thank you everybody for helping this group effort!

3748
04:32:50,190 --> 04:32:51,290
This is great!

3749
04:32:58,190 --> 04:32:59,930
So fast!

3750
04:32:59,990 --> 04:33:00,770
Well done!

3751
04:33:00,870 --> 04:33:01,190
Yeah!

3752
04:33:01,290 --> 04:33:02,850
You guys killed it!

3753
04:33:02,850 --> 04:33:05,490
Good job!

3754
04:33:08,050 --> 04:33:09,610
Told you nothing to worry about.

3755
04:33:09,650 --> 04:33:09,970
Truly.

3756
04:33:11,230 --> 04:33:12,850
I feel like...

3757
04:33:13,930 --> 04:33:15,850
I got hurt more in other...

3758
04:33:30,900 --> 04:33:31,940
Jackpot for real.

3759
04:33:38,660 --> 04:33:39,860
Got it!

3760
04:33:43,700 --> 04:33:45,080
That's so many boards!

3761
04:33:45,280 --> 04:33:46,140
I've never seen so many.

3762
04:33:52,480 --> 04:33:57,680
I guess... I feel with Peace Walker it is difficult to get the AI pod.

3763
04:33:58,600 --> 04:34:04,520
Like it's pretty... This is kind of like tucked in under her head so...

3764
04:34:07,840 --> 04:34:11,300
So the pod ends up being kind of not...

3765
04:34:12,540 --> 04:34:14,900
So damaged compared to the other places.

3766
04:34:21,160 --> 04:34:22,780
Just shy of 6 minutes.

3767
04:34:23,000 --> 04:34:23,220
Wow!

3768
04:34:24,180 --> 04:34:25,820
Yeah it's hidden under the giant radar dome.

3769
04:34:25,940 --> 04:34:26,880
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

3770
04:34:27,000 --> 04:34:29,380
So it's a little more tricky to get in there.

3771
04:34:33,760 --> 04:34:36,840
Tucked in and you have to attack the body when she launches a nuke.

3772
04:34:39,720 --> 04:34:41,180
Yeah baby!

3773
04:34:42,740 --> 04:34:44,360
Goodbye Peace Walker again.

3774
04:34:46,300 --> 04:34:47,500
Goodbye

3775
04:34:50,980 --> 04:34:52,280
Peace Walker again.

3776
04:34:56,760 --> 04:34:57,960
Peace.

3777
04:35:00,060 --> 04:35:01,700
Peace out.

3778
04:35:07,810 --> 04:35:09,650
Do I sound like the vampire?

3779
04:35:09,650 --> 04:35:12,090
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

3780
04:35:22,800 --> 04:35:24,840
They'll never hear me coming!

3781
04:35:29,740 --> 04:35:31,880
Obtain Paz's diary part 2.

3782
04:35:34,200 --> 04:35:35,160
Let's rank.

3783
04:35:35,380 --> 04:35:36,000
Let's go.

3784
04:35:37,980 --> 04:35:38,680
Crazy.

3785
04:35:41,320 --> 04:35:42,280
Count Minto.

3786
04:35:48,840 --> 04:35:49,800
I'm scared.

3787
04:35:59,040 --> 04:36:00,400
I'm scared.

3788
04:36:00,800 --> 04:36:01,920
What if it's not there?

3789
04:36:04,940 --> 04:36:06,700
I'm scared!

3790
04:37:02,910 --> 04:37:03,390
Snake...

3791
04:37:03,390 --> 04:37:07,450
Would you be up for going to the coast to watch the sunset?

3792
04:37:08,370 --> 04:37:09,290
Just the two of us?

3793
04:37:39,200 --> 04:37:40,500
His favorite color.

3794
04:37:40,900 --> 04:37:41,680
Let's rock.

3795
04:38:06,490 --> 04:38:09,030
Now does he like the same things Paz liked?

3796
04:38:13,120 --> 04:38:14,680
Is the question.

3797
04:38:17,360 --> 04:38:19,020
I don't have the sunset yet, no?

3798
04:38:20,100 --> 04:38:22,240
Don't I have to...

3799
04:38:22,240 --> 04:38:24,540
I can only get it from this, no?

3800
04:38:26,080 --> 04:38:27,100
I don't have the sunset.

3801
04:38:48,320 --> 04:38:49,340
Trunks' Paz.

3802
04:38:49,420 --> 04:38:50,080
No, I got the...

3803
04:38:50,080 --> 04:38:50,620
Wait, no.

3804
04:38:51,280 --> 04:38:51,960
I never...

3805
04:39:54,360 --> 04:39:55,760
Sorry.

3806
04:39:56,180 --> 04:39:57,820
Sorry Kaz.

3807
04:40:18,120 --> 04:40:19,320
What's he got?

3808
04:40:32,080 --> 04:40:33,040
Wake up.

3809
04:40:36,080 --> 04:40:36,520
Ah!

3810
04:41:21,510 --> 04:41:23,110
Hey, come on now.

3811
04:41:23,350 --> 04:41:25,530
We're friends, aren't we?

3812
04:41:36,690 --> 04:41:37,430
Naturally.

3813
04:41:45,900 --> 04:41:48,400
Why was it a fist?

3814
04:41:49,220 --> 04:41:50,860
Because of you Miller.

3815
04:41:51,320 --> 04:41:53,840
That was not a clap.

3816
04:41:56,500 --> 04:41:58,840
Why was there a fist clap?

3817
04:42:02,440 --> 04:42:03,520
You're pretty good.

3818
04:42:04,440 --> 04:42:05,360
Cut it out.

3819
04:42:05,440 --> 04:42:06,400
You're making me blush.

3820
04:42:08,300 --> 04:42:09,180
I'm with you.

3821
04:42:16,000 --> 04:42:17,260
You can do this.

3822
04:42:18,360 --> 04:42:20,920
Snake, you're gonna make me cry.

3823
04:42:31,680 --> 04:42:32,640
Good to have you.

3824
04:42:33,980 --> 04:42:35,080
Hey, come on now.

3825
04:42:35,280 --> 04:42:36,180
We're friends, aren't we?

3826
04:42:37,100 --> 04:42:37,800
Stop!

3827
04:42:52,740 --> 04:42:54,140
Oh

3828
04:43:01,650 --> 04:43:03,050
no!

3829
04:43:06,550 --> 04:43:07,730
Don't clap.

3830
04:43:21,060 --> 04:43:23,660
Wait, I don't think he'll like that one.

3831
04:43:30,380 --> 04:43:31,360
No!

3832
04:43:41,900 --> 04:43:43,840
Don't play.

3833
04:43:53,360 --> 04:43:54,780
Don't die on me.

3834
04:43:56,140 --> 04:43:57,100
You too.

3835
04:44:04,870 --> 04:44:05,350
Impressive.

3836
04:44:10,330 --> 04:44:10,810
Impressive.

3837
04:44:12,170 --> 04:44:12,870
Cut it out.

3838
04:44:12,970 --> 04:44:13,970
You're making me blush.

3839
04:44:29,840 --> 04:44:30,800
I like you too.

3840
04:44:32,060 --> 04:44:32,540
Sorry.

3841
04:44:32,900 --> 04:44:33,820
I didn't mean to touch that.

3842
04:44:33,960 --> 04:44:34,140
Wait.

3843
04:44:34,920 --> 04:44:35,920
Oh my god.

3844
04:44:36,080 --> 04:44:38,140
Wait, I just threw my hands everywhere.

3845
04:44:48,990 --> 04:44:49,590
Sorry,

3846
04:44:53,570 --> 04:44:54,250
we're blowing it.

3847
04:45:05,610 --> 04:45:07,490
I got nothing to hide.

3848
04:45:27,160 --> 04:45:29,780
Make sure you get a good shot of my muscles.

3849
04:45:38,650 --> 04:45:40,170
Can I please?

3850
04:45:40,670 --> 04:45:42,510
I think I can't do that.

3851
04:45:48,830 --> 04:45:49,470
Stop

3852
04:45:52,660 --> 04:45:52,980
it.

3853
04:46:12,150 --> 04:46:14,710
Stop it.

3854
04:46:16,230 --> 04:46:18,030
Get a pic of the pack.

3855
04:46:21,480 --> 04:46:22,720
Oh, sorry.

3856
04:46:52,150 --> 04:46:54,770
He looks so stupid.

3857
04:46:54,770 --> 04:46:55,270
Oh,

3858
04:47:00,920 --> 04:47:02,120
got room for two.

3859
04:47:58,850 --> 04:48:01,790
This playthrough is one of my favorite MGS experiences.

3860
04:48:02,390 --> 04:48:06,090
I didn't mean to pull a Johnny Akiba at the end, but I always enjoy seeing your love for the series.

3861
04:48:06,230 --> 04:48:09,870
I hope you can convince your friends to beat the series because watching you has been a great ride.

3862
04:48:11,370 --> 04:48:12,370
Thank you, McMahon!

3863
04:48:14,250 --> 04:48:16,530
Thank you for your help with the vital boxes.

3864
04:48:17,330 --> 04:48:18,470
And all the other stuff too.

3865
04:48:19,010 --> 04:48:20,750
If it isn't Sussy Mint.

3866
04:48:26,450 --> 04:48:28,310
How do you get that other outfit?

3867
04:48:29,330 --> 04:48:30,690
How do you get the bathing suit?

3868
04:48:33,990 --> 04:48:35,250
I S-ranked it.

3869
04:48:35,610 --> 04:48:36,490
So good.

3870
04:48:41,790 --> 04:48:43,550
Lost a lot of bros and shambles.

3871
04:48:43,650 --> 04:48:46,850
Oh, it's on the docks.

3872
04:48:47,410 --> 04:48:48,510
I have to get it with Paz too.

3873
04:48:49,610 --> 04:48:51,230
Let me go get it.

3874
04:48:53,930 --> 04:48:55,170
Holy cannoli.

3875
04:48:57,370 --> 04:48:58,610
We'll just go as we go.

3876
04:49:03,600 --> 04:49:05,460
Vassalat will always be my OTP.

3877
04:49:06,840 --> 04:49:09,820
But this is like a fan service beyond...

3878
04:49:10,920 --> 04:49:11,960
Only people...

3879
04:49:11,960 --> 04:49:13,910
I forgot that she's a...

3880
04:49:17,870 --> 04:49:19,270
Sorry!

3881
04:49:23,880 --> 04:49:25,280
Sorry!

3882
04:49:25,580 --> 04:49:30,360
Sorry Paz!

3883
04:49:38,300 --> 04:49:41,100
Oh sorry!

3884
04:49:41,100 --> 04:49:41,240
Sorry!

3885
04:49:44,100 --> 04:49:44,720
Creep!

3886
04:49:45,240 --> 04:49:45,940
Oh, whoops.

3887
04:49:46,140 --> 04:49:47,060
I messed up.

3888
04:50:19,670 --> 04:50:21,530
I won't run at you.

3889
04:50:22,230 --> 04:50:23,670
I'm going to run over here.

3890
04:50:23,710 --> 04:50:24,690
I see it, I see it.

3891
04:50:24,750 --> 04:50:26,010
I forgot to grab it before.

3892
04:50:30,030 --> 04:50:30,590
Citrix!

3893
04:50:32,790 --> 04:50:34,670
You're really lucky you're a woman.

3894
04:50:36,910 --> 04:50:39,110
I'm so glad I'm a woman!

3895
04:50:43,750 --> 04:50:45,630
Like the crack!

3896
04:50:47,650 --> 04:50:50,450
The crack of dawn, baby!

3897
04:50:51,670 --> 04:50:52,350
Golly!

3898
04:50:53,850 --> 04:50:54,530
Sorry!

3899
04:50:54,690 --> 04:50:55,970
No, don't run from me!

3900
04:50:56,230 --> 04:50:56,430
Paz!

3901
04:50:57,050 --> 04:50:57,950
Paz, please!

3902
04:50:58,650 --> 04:51:00,410
Paz, don't run from me!

3903
04:51:00,810 --> 04:51:01,150
Stop!

3904
04:51:02,050 --> 04:51:02,730
Stop!

3905
04:51:02,950 --> 04:51:04,370
Stop my beautiful angel!

3906
04:51:19,280 --> 04:51:20,320
Ok, wait.

3907
04:51:20,780 --> 04:51:21,580
Did that count?

3908
04:51:22,540 --> 04:51:23,820
Did that count?

3909
04:51:27,200 --> 04:51:28,540
Did that count?

3910
04:51:29,080 --> 04:51:30,500
I still got it, right?

3911
04:51:44,870 --> 04:51:46,590
I have goosebumps.

3912
04:51:48,470 --> 04:51:49,290
Oh wait.

3913
04:51:50,330 --> 04:51:52,030
Oh no, it didn't count!

3914
04:51:52,470 --> 04:51:57,330
I have to go back in again and again!

3915
04:51:57,630 --> 04:51:59,910
Ok, Paz, I won't scare you this time.

3916
04:51:59,970 --> 04:52:00,590
I'm so sorry.

3917
04:52:00,590 --> 04:52:01,970
I won't scare you.

3918
04:52:02,010 --> 04:52:03,230
I won't scare you this time.

3919
04:52:05,870 --> 04:52:07,650
I need to beat it correctly.

3920
04:52:09,850 --> 04:52:11,290
Rinse FBI agent.

3921
04:52:11,430 --> 04:52:12,190
She's guilty!

3922
04:52:13,230 --> 04:52:13,490
Ok.

3923
04:52:17,370 --> 04:52:19,170
It's not my fault if I run.

3924
04:52:19,250 --> 04:52:20,150
She gets scared.

3925
04:52:25,870 --> 04:52:27,430
Yeah, act natural everybody.

3926
04:52:27,570 --> 04:52:28,110
Act natural.

3927
04:52:44,820 --> 04:52:46,480
What are you doing like that?

3928
04:52:50,940 --> 04:52:51,500
Sorry.

3929
04:52:52,780 --> 04:52:53,960
Did you come here to swim?

3930
04:52:54,420 --> 04:52:55,400
It's too dangerous.

3931
04:52:55,940 --> 04:52:57,500
Ok, I'll stand over there.

3932
04:52:58,540 --> 04:52:59,840
And you stand there.

3933
04:52:59,980 --> 04:53:00,660
You're pretty good.

3934
04:53:01,900 --> 04:53:03,080
Stay away from me!

3935
04:53:05,040 --> 04:53:07,120
I don't think she likes me anymore.

3936
04:53:08,220 --> 04:53:08,820
I'm with you.

3937
04:53:11,580 --> 04:53:12,140
Bonnie?

3938
04:53:12,620 --> 04:53:13,580
Why not Bonnie?

3939
04:53:14,960 --> 04:53:17,440
I like my Bonnie.

3940
04:53:18,320 --> 04:53:20,180
She hates me!

3941
04:53:25,460 --> 04:53:28,140
I think I have to change.

3942
04:53:31,100 --> 04:53:32,400
What do you mean?

3943
04:53:32,500 --> 04:53:33,580
Are you here to swim?

3944
04:53:38,360 --> 04:53:40,560
She hates me!

3945
04:53:43,620 --> 04:53:45,380
How do I get out of the mission?

3946
04:53:47,180 --> 04:53:48,740
How do I get out?

3947
04:53:59,310 --> 04:54:00,390
She's so cute.

3948
04:54:01,430 --> 04:54:03,290
You're going to take a picture of me?

3949
04:54:03,630 --> 04:54:05,530
Oh my god, she's too cute.

3950
04:54:06,190 --> 04:54:07,670
She's too sticky cute.

3951
04:54:08,290 --> 04:54:10,510
Gosh, she's so cute.

3952
04:54:13,990 --> 04:54:16,910
Wait, when she turns and you see the little bit of cheek...

3953
04:54:17,450 --> 04:54:17,970
Right there!

3954
04:54:18,610 --> 04:54:19,270
Do you see it?

3955
04:54:20,250 --> 04:54:21,270
Do you see?

3956
04:54:21,750 --> 04:54:22,630
And there!

3957
04:54:23,390 --> 04:54:26,110
Hold on, I'll get closer.

3958
04:54:28,110 --> 04:54:31,410
The other angle was better.

3959
04:54:31,850 --> 04:54:33,110
There, you see it?

3960
04:54:37,240 --> 04:54:38,980
Pies, can you lift your arm?

3961
04:54:39,640 --> 04:54:40,740
Fix your hair?

3962
04:54:42,940 --> 04:54:44,760
You're going to take a picture of me?

3963
04:54:44,760 --> 04:54:45,240
There!

3964
04:54:49,400 --> 04:54:50,940
Don't move.

3965
04:54:51,840 --> 04:54:53,980
Why is she spinning with us?

3966
04:55:07,850 --> 04:55:08,970
Oh sorry.

3967
04:55:11,050 --> 04:55:12,370
Sorry Pies!

3968
04:55:20,010 --> 04:55:22,630
I think that's a lie.

3969
04:55:24,850 --> 04:55:26,430
Does she have anything on her?

3970
04:55:27,850 --> 04:55:28,690
Wait, come here.

3971
04:55:28,750 --> 04:55:35,710
The way she stomps away is too cute!

3972
04:55:40,870 --> 04:55:44,570
This is how I sound when I'm yelling at my cat.

3973
04:55:45,430 --> 04:55:45,950
Pies,

3974
04:55:50,350 --> 04:55:50,590
wait!

3975
04:55:51,870 --> 04:55:52,390
Pies!

3976
04:55:52,390 --> 04:55:53,830
Alright, properly.

3977
04:55:54,630 --> 04:55:57,030
We're going to get the bathing suit and then we're going to go back to Kazahira Miller!

3978
04:56:05,870 --> 04:56:07,130
She wants a tux.

3979
04:56:17,110 --> 04:56:18,910
Why do I have all this stuff on me?

3980
04:56:23,090 --> 04:56:24,510
This is our Oshi everyone.

3981
04:56:26,590 --> 04:56:28,170
Hate to see her leave.

3982
04:56:28,290 --> 04:56:29,670
Love to watch her go away.

3983
04:56:29,970 --> 04:56:31,170
Yeah baby!

3984
04:56:33,370 --> 04:56:35,810
I'm going to wear Miller's outfit to Miller.

3985
04:56:39,250 --> 04:56:39,890
Nemi!

3986
04:56:40,150 --> 04:56:40,650
Oh gosh.

3987
04:56:45,850 --> 04:56:46,970
Hello Nemi!

3988
04:56:48,730 --> 04:56:50,470
Nemi, please look away.

3989
04:56:52,210 --> 04:56:53,130
Nemi, please.

3990
04:56:53,510 --> 04:56:54,270
Nemi, Nemi!

3991
04:56:54,270 --> 04:56:56,490
Nemi, please.

3992
04:56:57,550 --> 04:56:59,470
Please look away.

3993
04:57:01,890 --> 04:57:07,370
This is just a cute girl in her lingerie.

3994
04:57:08,170 --> 04:57:11,850
I'm not doing anything suspicious.

3995
04:57:13,510 --> 04:57:17,150
Definitely not getting that little cheat.

3996
04:57:17,630 --> 04:57:18,050
Bam!

3997
04:57:18,370 --> 04:57:19,070
Oh god!

3998
04:57:19,430 --> 04:57:22,050
Right there!

3999
04:57:25,230 --> 04:57:28,170
Thank you for the gift!

4000
04:57:28,550 --> 04:57:29,430
Thank you!

4001
04:57:32,790 --> 04:57:35,250
I'm getting nice sunset pictures.

4002
04:57:38,050 --> 04:57:40,070
Of Kazahira Miller.

4003
04:57:43,440 --> 04:57:45,080
It just so happens.

4004
04:57:46,300 --> 04:57:49,220
It's a nice view in more ways than one.

4005
04:57:49,220 --> 04:57:49,860
My bad.

4006
04:57:52,380 --> 04:57:54,680
Now I have to woo her everybody.

4007
04:57:58,560 --> 04:57:59,040
Hello?

4008
04:58:06,480 --> 04:58:08,400
What a time for a Nipi raid.

4009
04:58:08,860 --> 04:58:11,920
How do you think of Nipi?

4010
04:58:12,760 --> 04:58:14,240
Matthew, thank you for the 5k.

4011
04:58:14,280 --> 04:58:14,780
Thank you!

4012
04:58:15,960 --> 04:58:17,880
We are not going to try and S it.

4013
04:58:17,880 --> 04:58:20,280
I like it.

4014
04:58:23,620 --> 04:58:25,540
Ok, now watch what happens.

4015
04:58:25,900 --> 04:58:26,660
Oh sorry!

4016
04:58:31,090 --> 04:58:32,290
Room for one more?

4017
04:58:36,450 --> 04:58:37,690
It's just like The Sims!

4018
04:58:53,530 --> 04:58:54,210
Yes!

4019
04:58:54,910 --> 04:58:56,810
Now watch this too!

4020
04:58:59,370 --> 04:59:00,890
Watch this one too!

4021
04:59:01,030 --> 04:59:02,070
Watch the next one!

4022
04:59:04,830 --> 04:59:07,170
Metal Gear is really exciting, right guys?

4023
04:59:11,090 --> 04:59:11,490
Amazing!

4024
04:59:11,790 --> 04:59:14,010
That right there is why you are the best boss.

4025
04:59:14,870 --> 04:59:15,590
How old is she?

4026
04:59:15,670 --> 04:59:16,450
She is in her twenties.

4027
04:59:16,650 --> 04:59:17,290
Don't worry.

4028
04:59:19,190 --> 04:59:20,710
Oh, I shouldn't have skipped it.

4029
04:59:20,790 --> 04:59:21,490
You know, it's fine.

4030
04:59:30,090 --> 04:59:30,490
Wait,

4031
04:59:34,450 --> 04:59:35,030
wait, wait, wait.

4032
04:59:35,890 --> 04:59:37,130
Ok, we got enough.

4033
04:59:39,530 --> 04:59:42,030
Fine beach side photography skills boss.

4034
04:59:42,110 --> 04:59:42,990
Thank you!

4035
04:59:44,770 --> 04:59:45,410
Kazuhira!

4036
04:59:48,070 --> 04:59:49,230
And then, hold on.

4037
04:59:49,490 --> 04:59:51,350
We are going to go through this one real fast.

4038
04:59:53,790 --> 04:59:55,290
Oh my god, we are matching!

4039
04:59:59,170 --> 05:00:01,630
Wait, somebody has to change.

4040
05:00:03,890 --> 05:00:04,950
Wait a second!

4041
05:00:14,810 --> 05:00:16,510
Wait, wasn't there a speedo?

4042
05:00:19,270 --> 05:00:21,090
Or does Snake not have the speedo?

4043
05:00:24,730 --> 05:00:25,130
Twinsies.

4044
05:00:25,370 --> 05:00:26,990
I wish I could get like a...

4045
05:00:28,390 --> 05:00:30,430
Oh my god, look how cute they are.

4046
05:00:33,150 --> 05:00:35,330
I think you may have unlocked it if you S rank him.

4047
05:00:35,430 --> 05:00:36,470
I did S rank him though.

4048
05:00:37,270 --> 05:00:38,590
I need an adult.

4049
05:00:42,970 --> 05:00:43,450
Oh,

4050
05:00:47,390 --> 05:00:47,790
wake up!

4051
05:00:49,590 --> 05:00:50,350
Wake up!

4052
05:00:55,450 --> 05:00:57,130
I don't think you want this nightmare.

4053
05:01:00,150 --> 05:01:02,210
You need to beat it in the swim trunks.

4054
05:01:02,710 --> 05:01:03,630
Ok, hold on.

4055
05:01:04,630 --> 05:01:05,590
Let's leave.

4056
05:01:09,510 --> 05:01:12,330
Yeah that guy, Kazuhira Miller, he is from Japan.

4057
05:01:19,750 --> 05:01:20,910
I love

4058
05:01:32,270 --> 05:01:32,690
the beach.

4059
05:01:35,990 --> 05:01:37,230
Wait, where is my camera?

4060
05:01:48,000 --> 05:01:49,280
I love the beach.

4061
05:01:59,500 --> 05:02:00,500
Jump!

4062
05:02:11,080 --> 05:02:12,580
There it

4063
05:02:16,830 --> 05:02:17,330
is!

4064
05:02:19,450 --> 05:02:21,690
This is true peace.

4065
05:02:25,280 --> 05:02:28,560
Why would anyone wear this on the battlefield?

4066
05:02:28,700 --> 05:02:29,460
It's a mystery.

4067
05:02:31,860 --> 05:02:33,420
I know it.

4068
05:02:33,420 --> 05:02:36,740
God, look at... wait, wait.

4069
05:02:37,060 --> 05:02:39,420
You can see... look at Snake's...

4070
05:02:56,470 --> 05:02:57,270
Why

4071
05:03:02,670 --> 05:03:04,710
is it so... here, I'll do a level.

4072
05:03:19,230 --> 05:03:20,030
Oh,

4073
05:03:27,950 --> 05:03:28,650
sorry.

4074
05:03:29,410 --> 05:03:30,510
Oh no, he's serious.

4075
05:03:39,150 --> 05:03:42,050
I like how the song is just so sad, but...

4076
05:04:30,330 --> 05:04:31,210
Oh, sorry.

4077
05:04:38,410 --> 05:04:38,950
Oh, sorry.

4078
05:04:39,750 --> 05:04:40,870
I accidentally ran into you.

4079
05:04:44,310 --> 05:04:45,130
Listen to me.

4080
05:04:49,570 --> 05:04:51,310
Ok, the music needs to change.

4081
05:04:57,650 --> 05:04:59,090
Where is this from?

4082
05:05:06,770 --> 05:05:07,890
We'll do Calling to the Night.

4083
05:05:41,140 --> 05:05:45,700
Oh, sorry, I go too fast.

4084
05:06:25,650 --> 05:06:26,410
Oh,

4085
05:06:36,700 --> 05:06:37,460
sorry.

4086
05:06:37,460 --> 05:06:38,720
I guess it's a fun game.

4087
05:06:52,770 --> 05:06:54,670
This is interpretive dance.

4088
05:06:58,500 --> 05:07:01,540
Now he runs into the sunset.

4089
05:08:17,850 --> 05:08:19,390
No, he didn't like it!

4090
05:08:23,550 --> 05:08:24,070
No!

4091
05:08:24,070 --> 05:08:24,990
Guys, no!

4092
05:08:25,170 --> 05:08:25,950
What do you mean?

4093
05:08:26,270 --> 05:08:28,870
He'll probably still want to go in with us though.

4094
05:08:34,740 --> 05:08:36,820
Welcome to Metal Gear Solid!

4095
05:08:39,400 --> 05:08:43,860
I made the official Calling to the Night music video.

4096
05:08:53,970 --> 05:08:54,630
Anyways...

4097
05:08:56,170 --> 05:08:58,650
Yeah, that was...

4098
05:08:59,610 --> 05:09:01,450
That was Metal Gear!

4099
05:09:02,530 --> 05:09:04,030
That was Metal Gear!

4100
05:09:07,410 --> 05:09:08,070
Wait,

4101
05:09:12,970 --> 05:09:13,670
2 perfectly.

4102
05:09:13,790 --> 05:09:15,130
Wait, what other raid did we get?

4103
05:09:16,610 --> 05:09:17,970
We got 2 raids?

4104
05:09:21,650 --> 05:09:23,190
I enjoyed my stay.

4105
05:09:31,890 --> 05:09:32,770
Oh, Doki!

4106
05:09:33,210 --> 05:09:33,630
Oh no.

4107
05:09:36,470 --> 05:09:37,810
Wait, Doki at the same time?

4108
05:09:37,890 --> 05:09:38,410
I didn't see it.

4109
05:09:38,870 --> 05:09:41,090
Boss and Kai's steam room audio on YouTube?

4110
05:09:41,250 --> 05:09:42,470
Oh yeah, I've listened to it.

4111
05:09:43,750 --> 05:09:45,030
Oh, Dragoon self-raid.

4112
05:09:57,560 --> 05:10:00,700
I'm going to relate that song to that moment every time I hear it.

4113
05:10:05,420 --> 05:10:06,300
Well guys...

4114
05:10:06,840 --> 05:10:09,180
To everybody who raided, thank you.

4115
05:10:10,580 --> 05:10:12,300
I just finished the game.

4116
05:10:13,540 --> 05:10:14,800
It was a good time.

4117
05:10:14,940 --> 05:10:16,060
It was a lot of fun.

4118
05:10:18,520 --> 05:10:18,960
And...

4119
05:10:21,090 --> 05:10:22,330
Finally won 1,000 wins.

4120
05:10:22,390 --> 05:10:23,350
Thank you!

4121
05:10:26,590 --> 05:10:27,970
Is this game not that long?

4122
05:10:28,110 --> 05:10:29,810
Oh no, it's pretty long actually.

4123
05:10:30,810 --> 05:10:31,250
There's...

4124
05:10:32,870 --> 05:10:34,090
Quite a bit of content.

4125
05:10:34,310 --> 05:10:35,410
Actually, it's very...

4126
05:10:35,410 --> 05:10:39,590
I mean, even just for extra ops, there's over a hundred.

4127
05:10:40,170 --> 05:10:41,870
And the main ops...

4128
05:10:41,870 --> 05:10:43,310
There's a lot too.

4129
05:10:44,710 --> 05:10:47,490
This game is very, very jam-packed with stuff.

4130
05:10:52,470 --> 05:10:53,890
Yeah, this is the 5th stream.

4131
05:10:54,030 --> 05:10:54,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4132
05:10:55,350 --> 05:10:56,490
I should have mentioned that too.

4133
05:10:56,570 --> 05:10:58,270
Yeah, I beat...

4134
05:10:58,270 --> 05:10:59,730
The game...

4135
05:10:59,730 --> 05:10:59,970
Today.

4136
05:11:02,330 --> 05:11:03,550
Toki raided that and saw that.

4137
05:11:03,610 --> 05:11:04,430
She probably played it.

4138
05:11:04,450 --> 05:11:05,390
I don't think so.

4139
05:11:08,470 --> 05:11:10,290
Peak Metal Gear, Peak Kojima, Peak Cinema.

4140
05:11:10,610 --> 05:11:10,750
Yeah!

4141
05:11:12,190 --> 05:11:14,210
I recently finished this on PSP again.

4142
05:11:14,330 --> 05:11:14,970
Oh nice!

4143
05:11:15,130 --> 05:11:15,890
It's so fun.

4144
05:11:19,070 --> 05:11:21,530
Maybe I'll take a look at this after I'm done with Phantom Pain.

4145
05:11:22,010 --> 05:11:23,750
If you...

4146
05:11:23,750 --> 05:11:28,070
The story of this game is what makes Phantom Pain make sense.

4147
05:11:31,170 --> 05:11:33,830
Did we watch Snake play Kaz like a fiddle?

4148
05:11:37,050 --> 05:11:37,370
Probably.

4149
05:11:37,630 --> 05:11:38,170
Great content.

4150
05:11:38,310 --> 05:11:38,670
Thank you.

4151
05:11:38,890 --> 05:11:40,050
This is the most peak way to end.

4152
05:11:40,130 --> 05:11:41,070
Have a great night, boss.

4153
05:11:41,470 --> 05:11:42,090
Oh, good night.

4154
05:11:42,190 --> 05:11:43,450
Sorry, you're not telling me to have a great night.

4155
05:11:43,510 --> 05:11:44,970
I just filled that in with my own brain.

4156
05:11:45,430 --> 05:11:46,330
And WSF.

4157
05:11:49,630 --> 05:11:50,230
Ah...

4158
05:11:52,790 --> 05:11:53,390
Oh,

4159
05:11:58,030 --> 05:11:58,650
wait a second.

4160
05:11:59,130 --> 05:12:01,830
How do I show off the models?

4161
05:12:02,150 --> 05:12:03,450
Wait, where is it under again?

4162
05:12:04,270 --> 05:12:06,430
Is it under R&D?

4163
05:12:08,130 --> 05:12:10,210
Because can't I also see her underwear?

4164
05:12:16,310 --> 05:12:16,910
Personnel.

4165
05:12:24,240 --> 05:12:25,100
Where's pause?

4166
05:12:27,340 --> 05:12:28,840
Are you sure it's here?

4167
05:12:37,050 --> 05:12:39,330
First stream that I've actually watched live and it's been very funny.

4168
05:12:39,430 --> 05:12:40,370
Thank you!

4169
05:12:43,750 --> 05:12:46,230
Double tap triangle or... Okay, let me see.

4170
05:12:48,470 --> 05:12:49,430
Let's do...

4171
05:12:50,230 --> 05:12:53,790
Oh, it's only for some.

4172
05:12:53,910 --> 05:12:55,210
Like Chico didn't allow it.

4173
05:13:06,690 --> 05:13:08,130
When did this happen?

4174
05:13:11,510 --> 05:13:12,110
Wow!

4175
05:13:13,290 --> 05:13:13,890
Wow!

4176
05:13:14,730 --> 05:13:15,550
Thank you!

4177
05:13:15,890 --> 05:13:16,050
Thank you!

4178
05:13:16,130 --> 05:13:16,630
Thank you!

4179
05:13:16,830 --> 05:13:17,150
Thank you!

4180
05:13:17,750 --> 05:13:18,350
Thank you!

4181
05:13:18,570 --> 05:13:19,530
Thank you!

4182
05:13:19,810 --> 05:13:20,430
Thank you!

4183
05:13:20,550 --> 05:13:20,870
Wow!

4184
05:13:21,530 --> 05:13:23,050
What the...

4185
05:13:23,530 --> 05:13:24,550
Thank you, Lord!

4186
05:13:24,970 --> 05:13:25,590
Thank you!

4187
05:13:25,970 --> 05:13:26,330
Thank you!

4188
05:13:26,730 --> 05:13:27,250
Thank you!

4189
05:13:32,460 --> 05:13:33,340
Thank you!

4190
05:13:35,280 --> 05:13:36,980
Does Huey have a... Oh, what?

4191
05:13:37,700 --> 05:13:39,140
No, Huey doesn't.

4192
05:13:47,670 --> 05:13:48,490
Thank you!

4193
05:13:49,050 --> 05:13:49,450
Thank you!

4194
05:13:49,710 --> 05:13:50,390
Thank you!

4195
05:13:50,870 --> 05:13:52,430
Thank you!

4196
05:13:53,050 --> 05:13:53,790
Hideo Kojima!

4197
05:13:54,330 --> 05:13:55,130
Kojima is gone!

4198
05:13:55,210 --> 05:13:55,930
Kojima is gone!

4199
05:13:59,050 --> 05:13:59,650
Kojima...

4200
05:14:01,610 --> 05:14:02,930
That's my girl!

4201
05:14:09,860 --> 05:14:10,920
This bear have one.

4202
05:14:13,800 --> 05:14:15,300
Chico doesn't have one.

4203
05:14:15,580 --> 05:14:16,180
Maybe Amanda?

4204
05:14:17,240 --> 05:14:18,180
Where is Amanda under?

4205
05:14:20,760 --> 05:14:21,880
Pause, Chico.

4206
05:14:23,060 --> 05:14:23,900
Or is she gone?

4207
05:14:25,340 --> 05:14:25,880
Technically.

4208
05:14:29,210 --> 05:14:29,770
Amanda!

4209
05:14:31,070 --> 05:14:32,150
Where are you?

4210
05:14:38,570 --> 05:14:39,610
Who is this?

4211
05:14:43,230 --> 05:14:44,870
What is TRD mean?

4212
05:14:48,540 --> 05:14:50,700
The boots stay on!

4213
05:14:51,040 --> 05:14:52,320
Wait, where is she?

4214
05:14:54,840 --> 05:14:55,280
Trade?

4215
05:14:57,960 --> 05:14:59,380
What do you mean trade?

4216
05:15:01,200 --> 05:15:01,880
Oh!

4217
05:15:02,100 --> 05:15:02,420
Oh!

4218
05:15:02,600 --> 05:15:02,860
Oh!

4219
05:15:03,000 --> 05:15:05,380
Sorry, I thought you meant like she was in trade.

4220
05:15:06,600 --> 05:15:08,800
I think maybe we...

4221
05:15:08,800 --> 05:15:11,620
We might have gotten rid of Amanda.

4222
05:15:13,820 --> 05:15:14,240
Wait!

4223
05:15:19,790 --> 05:15:21,010
No way!

4224
05:15:21,970 --> 05:15:23,170
Amanda, you're here.

4225
05:15:23,830 --> 05:15:24,650
Amanda, show yourself!

4226
05:15:27,410 --> 05:15:28,090
C...

4227
05:15:28,090 --> 05:15:31,350
Ask and you shall receive...

4228
05:15:31,350 --> 05:15:31,970
Oh my gosh!

4229
05:15:32,050 --> 05:15:32,430
I won!

4230
05:15:32,850 --> 05:15:35,770
Wait, I won the MSF top!

4231
05:15:37,430 --> 05:15:38,990
That's too cute!

4232
05:15:39,970 --> 05:15:40,910
I won it!

4233
05:15:41,030 --> 05:15:41,750
I won one!

4234
05:15:47,860 --> 05:15:50,720
The zoom in these games is extremely generous.

4235
05:15:52,720 --> 05:15:53,360
Wow!

4236
05:15:55,180 --> 05:15:57,840
Anyways guys, thank you for a piece of Walker!

4237
05:15:59,280 --> 05:16:02,680
And we will do Ground Zeroes sometime.

4238
05:16:03,280 --> 05:16:06,140
Either tomorrow or sometime next week.

4239
05:16:06,480 --> 05:16:06,680
Yes.

4240
05:16:08,800 --> 05:16:09,440
But...

4241
05:16:11,280 --> 05:16:14,980
From here, Metal Gear is just sad, sad, sad.

4242
05:16:15,200 --> 05:16:18,820
So, this is our last ounce of silly that we would have.

4243
05:16:20,120 --> 05:16:20,600
And...

4244
05:16:22,160 --> 05:16:24,420
Last, last bit of silliness.

4245
05:16:25,000 --> 05:16:27,380
Now it's time for sad, sad hours.

4246
05:16:28,920 --> 05:16:30,600
But this is a lot of fun.

4247
05:16:31,360 --> 05:16:31,940
And yeah!

4248
05:16:32,400 --> 05:16:33,640
I hope I was of decent help.

4249
05:16:33,660 --> 05:16:34,080
You were!

4250
05:16:34,420 --> 05:16:34,960
Thank you!

4251
05:16:35,540 --> 05:16:36,800
Don't worry about it, Sapphire.

4252
05:16:36,880 --> 05:16:38,620
We killed... We kicked butt.

4253
05:16:39,420 --> 05:16:39,900
Yeah!

4254
05:16:40,080 --> 05:16:40,660
Thank you.

4255
05:16:40,820 --> 05:16:42,200
Don't worry about it at all.

4256
05:16:48,050 --> 05:16:48,530
So...

4257
05:16:48,530 --> 05:16:48,990
Yeah!

4258
05:16:49,190 --> 05:16:50,070
Thank you guys.

4259
05:16:50,650 --> 05:16:51,190
And...

4260
05:16:51,190 --> 05:16:53,390
I'll see you when I see you.

4261
05:16:55,450 --> 05:16:55,990
Yeah!

4262
05:16:57,850 --> 05:16:58,390
Otsumito!

4263
05:17:01,330 --> 05:17:06,170
I don't know how to end this because it's like the game doesn't have like credits to us.

4264
05:17:06,390 --> 05:17:06,850
You know?

4265
05:17:07,550 --> 05:17:08,950
We already did the credits.

4266
05:17:10,270 --> 05:17:12,770
I wish we could just watch the...

4267
05:17:12,770 --> 05:17:15,290
I wish we could just watch...

4268
05:17:15,290 --> 05:17:16,590
