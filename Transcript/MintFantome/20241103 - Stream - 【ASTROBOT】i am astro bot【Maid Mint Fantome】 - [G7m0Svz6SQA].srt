1
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,750
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,810
Sorry if my intro, or rather my loading screen, is getting longer.

3
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,110
I just love this song so much.

4
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,530
I always want to listen to it.

5
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,350
I'm just jamming to it.

6
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,170
It's so fun.

7
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,090
I want to post it on my YouTube.

8
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,090
Wait, my channel?

9
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,050
That sounded so weird.

10
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,350
I want to post it, but I have to ask Mitsukiyo's permission first.

11
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,630
I want to ask if it's okay.

12
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,770
Welcome back, master and princess.

13
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,650
One second.

14
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,010
I forgot to turn on my fan.

15
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,090
Welcome back.

16
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,510
Oh my gosh, it's been a minute since I've played Astro Bot.

17
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,610
If you...

18
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,530
If you...

19
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,650
What's the word?

20
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,830
Haven't watched me play Astro Bot.

21
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,990
That's okay.

22
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,030
There's no story.

23
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,930
So, you can jump in.

24
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,650
What's kind of nice about this game is you can jump in and see anything with this kind of game.

25
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,670
Yeah, we just kind of crashed and we're putting together a PS5.

26
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,670
Just collect the bots.

27
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,090
We have a whole bot army.

28
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,170
She's an Astro Bot.

29
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,390
Astro Bot.

30
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,170
Yeah, the story is fix your PS5.

31
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,730
The story is don't you want a PS5?

32
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,310
Don't you want a PS5?

33
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,050
Don't you want one so that you can play or something?

34
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:36,550
Oh, I think also this is the first time the game chat CSS is being used.

35
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:48,790
As you can see, I have a more simplified version of chat so it doesn't take up so much space for games and stuff.

36
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,990
So, yeah.

37
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:53,890
Hi Mint.

38
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,250
Hello.

39
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,870
Hello, hello, hello.

40
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,610
Cozy chat.

41
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,350
Small screen.

42
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,430
Yeah, but I love this.

43
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,970
It says... My head is kind of blocking it.

44
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,010
Oh there.

45
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,010
Game progress 41%.

46
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,730
I don't know how long I'm going to play today.

47
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,610
I might get really into it.

48
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,010
I don't know.

49
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,330
I kind of want to beat the game so I can move on to other games, but I'm enjoying it so much.

50
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,370
It's also been so long since I've started it.

51
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,010
I'm like, I should get finished with it soon.

52
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,390
Paul, thank you.

53
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,610
Missed your karaoke in the debut just in time for Astro Bot.

54
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,190
Yes.

55
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,810
12 hour Astro Bot endurance incoming?

56
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,770
Maybe.

57
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,630
I don't know.

58
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,690
Welcome to membership.

59
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,390
Thank you.

60
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,930
Let's just start it.

61
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,240
Astro Bot.

62
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,480
Astro Bot.

63
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,520
Oh.

64
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,860
I wanted to say something.

65
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,880
Oh, it was about the Little Big Planet.

66
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,640
I've never played that series.

67
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,020
I thought it was so ugly.

68
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,260
But you bet your dollar I bought all the Metal Gear DLC for it.

69
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,060
Still trying to get used to your mochi mochi face.

70
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,020
My face is so mochi mochi.

71
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Oh.

72
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,680
Oh my gosh, we're filled with monkeys.

73
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,560
I thought that was Raiden for a second in the middle, but it's just... I think it's Castlevania.

74
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,120
I'm so round.

75
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,580
I know, I told you guys.

76
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,360
I was gonna become... My face, I was gonna become round.

77
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,820
I told you.

78
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,760
Bot.

79
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,420
I

80
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,210
am Astro Bot.

81
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,250
Astro Bot.

82
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,610
I am Astro Bot.

83
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,310
I am

84
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,020
Astro Bot.

85
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,840
I am Astro Bot.

86
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,090
Hotdog gotcha, sorry.

87
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,110
I don't think you got it, right Mac?

88
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,030
Cool.

89
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,360
Any button.

90
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:35,700
Okay.

91
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:36,820
Save.

92
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,260
There you go.

93
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
We're at 150 out of 300.

94
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,820
We're halfway there, you guys.

95
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,140
And we have two... two more universes to go through.

96
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,240
Did we finish everything here?

97
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,480
Why is the snake universe calling for us?

98
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Serpent Starlight.

99
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,400
Hi Minto.

100
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,500
Before you were talking about how people were already drawing you with pointy ears before knowing anything.

101
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,780
Some of us had this headcanon where your ears get pointy when you're hor...

102
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,060
What?

103
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,320
And you're Minto.

104
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,580
Have fun with that.

105
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,080
What do you mean have... How are you just gonna throw that information at me?

106
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,240
We?

107
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,280
We?

108
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,600
Some people are like, I'm not included in this... in this... in this headcanon.

109
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,220
Who's we?

110
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,710
Did I miss a page in the lore?

111
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,930
I think I also missed a page in the lore.

112
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,860
It's not... Is that not why your ears are perma-pointy now?

113
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,910
I don't know.

114
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,550
Anyway...

115
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,870
Let's go say hi to our bots real quick.

116
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,170
Let's go say... Let's go... It's been a while since we've seen them.

117
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,590
Where is he?

118
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,610
Where are you?

119
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:44,970
Snake!

120
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,410
Snake!

121
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,530
Naked snake.

122
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,150
Come here.

123
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,450
I like to bully them.

124
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,650
We have to get his... We have to get his little capsule.

125
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,350
We have to get his capsule.

126
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,130
All of our guys...

127
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,390
All of our guys are cat.

128
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,930
Cute, cute.

129
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,890
All of our normal guys... Woah, what's going on here?

130
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,270
Oh, they're building.

131
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,410
This is our PS5.

132
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,130
Oh, that's me.

133
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,490
Oh, it's like, why am I dressed up like this?

134
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,910
I forgot we got an outfit.

135
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,610
We have like clothes and stuff now.

136
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,630
Top 10 bulliable babies.

137
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,110
10 Snake, 9 Minto.

138
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,350
I kind of want to be...

139
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,510
How do I change?

140
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,590
Oh gosh.

141
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,050
How do I play this game again?

142
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,310
Oh, here we go.

143
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,330
I kind of want to change outfits.

144
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,830
Maybe do we want to be Bloodborne?

145
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,550
Mr. Bloodborne... John Bloodborne.

146
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,250
John Bloodborne?

147
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,690
Alright, we'll be John Bloodborne today.

148
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,090
Wow, we look so dapper.

149
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,110
Alright, let's go.

150
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,950
How much money do I have?

151
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,430
Let's see.

152
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,470
Let's see how much money I have for gacha.

153
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,350
Okay guys, we gotta go make some big bucks, okay?

154
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,550
We gotta go make the big dollars.

155
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,650
I meant to send this during the 3.0 stream, but this little wisp is super proud of you and all your work.

156
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,910
Thanks Joshua!

157
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,410
Thank you.

158
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,110
Here I go.

159
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,510
Everybody say goodbye to me.

160
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,090
Bye!

161
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,770
Bloodborne when?

162
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,430
Oh yeah, I gotta...

163
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,750
I gotta... There are so many games I gotta play, right?

164
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,050
Oh, we're here.

165
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,830
Oh, we're doing the...

166
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,910
What's that game called?

167
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,350
What is this?

168
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,030
Uncharted!

169
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:41,930
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,750
Don't mind me, I'm just here to see Johnny's combat.

171
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,030
Yes, he's there.

172
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,130
Uncharted World Time.

173
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,670
Dude writing.

174
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,350
Thank you!

175
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,750
Oh, no airplane!

176
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,090
Monkey business.

177
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,570
Can we die in here?

178
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,510
Okay guys, I learned.

179
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,110
I learned.

180
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,110
Can I beat this up?

181
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,990
Oh, sorry monkey.

182
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,870
We have a treasure map even here.

183
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,030
Hello.

184
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,790
Oh no!

185
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,350
Oh no!

186
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,590
Hey, where is my outfit?

187
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,570
We got a gun?

188
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,530
We have a gun?

189
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,290
I'm Johnny's combat.

190
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,390
Wait, how do I play this game again?

191
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:52,590
Shoot.

192
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,030
Oh, R2.

193
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,170
Oh, easy game.

194
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,250
Easy game.

195
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,450
Easy game.

196
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,190
Easy game.

197
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,550
The music is kind of awesome though.

198
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,630
Get up there!

199
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:11,470
Nothing?

200
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,990
Okay.

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,560
So cute and amazing with this game.

202
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,980
Oh my god.

203
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,820
That was close.

204
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,220
What are these?

205
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,760
Just little balls.

206
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,320
Oh, they disappear.

207
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,440
Oh no, they are little balls.

208
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,080
My balls!

209
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,860
No!

210
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,120
The music is awesome.

211
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,680
Is this from the game?

212
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,060
I wonder.

213
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,840
Thank you Ronin.

214
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,140
Oh!

215
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,640
There is a thing in here.

216
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,340
It's a remix of the soundtrack.

217
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,640
What

218
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,040
the?

219
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,020
Who shot me?

220
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,940
Who shot me?

221
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,540
Okay.

222
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,960
I think someone up there did.

223
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,260
Oh, the balls are for me.

224
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm shooting the balls.

225
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,140
Close.

226
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,450
I think we are good.

227
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,140
So sad.

228
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,220
I see him up there.

229
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,920
Let's go rescue our friend.

230
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,220
Skeleton too scary!

231
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,660
This is so fun.

232
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,340
Oh my gosh.

233
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,160
Shoot him!

234
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,540
Shoot him!

235
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,840
Oh my god.

236
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,040
I like how he literally is so smug after every kill.

237
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,440
There is this cutie in the bottom right corner of my screen.

238
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,180
John Uncharted.

239
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,380
This guy is gone where no guy has gone before.

240
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,960
Is this accurate to the game?

241
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,440
He does this?

242
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:32,740
Really?

243
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,440
I wanna appear.

244
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,990
We really took him out.

245
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,690
Wait.

246
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,830
Oh, I have to... How do I pull again?

247
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,630
Like this?

248
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,050
There we go.

249
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:53,970
Destroy!

250
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,090
Kick your ass!

251
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,410
Looting virtuoso.

252
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,730
Knows you love to see her leave.

253
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,050
Show me the assets.

254
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,950
Nathan Drake is a charming MF-er.

255
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,310
He's a mint Vandermeer?

256
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,850
I didn't know he was chill like that.

257
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,930
Wow, look at the little dragon.

258
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,130
It's so cute.

259
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:40,990
Totally.

260
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,070
Oh gosh, ok.

261
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,430
Alexander, thanks for the prank.

262
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,270
Thank you, thank you.

263
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,130
I'm trying to remember how to play this game.

264
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,030
We're gonna go this way.

265
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,210
Oh...

266
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,350
Give me the money.

267
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,090
Alright, alright.

268
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,370
Nice.

269
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,390
And now we go this...

270
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,410
This...

271
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,130
Wait!

272
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,810
That was close.

273
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,590
Ok, easy.

274
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,170
This game is making me walk the plank.

275
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,990
Oh my god.

276
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,610
Oh my god.

277
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,090
Who's yelling?

278
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,650
Who's laughing?

279
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,690
How's the music by the way guys?

280
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,610
Is it loud?

281
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,030
It feels a little...

282
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,430
It feels a little loud for me, but it's ok for you guys.

283
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,630
It's good?

284
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,770
It's good?

285
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,170
Oh my god.

286
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,730
Thank you guys.

287
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,230
I'll do...

288
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,410
I might be somewhat of a genius.

289
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,330
You can turn it down a tad if you want.

290
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,350
Maybe like that.

291
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,230
It's hard for me to hear myself talk.

292
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,710
Is that... still ok?

293
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,390
Is it too... I can't tell if it's too quiet now.

294
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,730
Is it better?

295
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,070
Ok.

296
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,370
Thank you guys.

297
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,170
Thank you.

298
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:33,730
Monkey?

299
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,670
Shoot.

300
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:43,710
Shoot.

301
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,030
Shoot.

302
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,830
Oh gosh, there are so many deads here.

303
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,310
What the hell?

304
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,450
Oh my god.

305
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,610
I got booby trapped!

306
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,870
Did we get Raiden last time?

307
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,950
We did not.

308
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,270
I have not gotten Raiden yet.

309
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,350
There's a ladder.

310
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,050
I see it.

311
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,630
Wait, this area has so much going on.

312
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,370
Where do I go from...

313
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,070
From this...

314
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,350
And then there's a ladder down here.

315
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:21,930
Ok, hold on.

316
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,630
Let's check out the ladder first.

317
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,970
Down here.

318
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,770
Oh, it's another one of these.

319
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,670
Oh, but I didn't see a face.

320
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,190
Did you guys?

321
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,390
Which face is it?

322
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,650
I didn't see a face to match it to.

323
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,650
Minto would fall for a booby trap.

324
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,170
Just call me Freerun, ok?

325
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,810
You have to explore every chest.

326
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,610
Or else... What's the point?

327
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,150
Let's see.

328
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,910
Maybe it's a... I guess we just try all of them.

329
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,430
Oh wait.

330
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,150
Ok, no.

331
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,690
Hard eyes?

332
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,510
Angry eyes?

333
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,910
Tired eyes?

334
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,730
Aha!

335
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,860
What does that mean?

336
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Bug.

337
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,750
What does that mean?

338
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,710
Mysterious.

339
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,970
No force like a brute force.

340
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,490
Ah!

341
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,310
Guys, I wonder which one it was.

342
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,320
What is this direction though?

343
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,100
I can't tell.

344
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,680
Maybe up?

345
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,700
But then there is also...

346
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,680
Surely they don't want me to use the rope to go up there.

347
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,240
Right, I can't tell.

348
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,020
And then there is the rope that direction.

349
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,480
I'm so confused where to go.

350
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,800
Alright, hold on.

351
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,580
Oh,

352
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,000
please let me look the other direction.

353
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,200
No, camera!

354
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,120
Ok, we are not done over here yet.

355
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Maybe I have to go from this way.

356
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,400
Ok, hold on.

357
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,740
From here...

358
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,200
Not a trap.

359
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
Just some flowers.

360
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,210
Let's grab this guy.

361
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,110
Oh my gosh.

362
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,030
Get him!

363
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,650
Get him!

364
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,010
Can you do a Mito beam?

365
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,110
Like that?

366
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,310
Sully, is this guy's name?

367
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,210
Thousand years old, dorky elf, ghost?

368
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,470
Loves gacha?

369
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,010
Sounds like free rent to me.

370
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,170
Mustachioed mentor.

371
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,910
Doing the best with the hand they've been dealt.

372
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,670
Can I get the monkey?

373
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,210
Dang.

374
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,730
No monkey for us.

375
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,630
He belongs in his natural habitat.

376
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,540
And...

377
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,580
Oh my god.

378
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,780
Where were those?

379
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,460
There were more though that I missed up there.

380
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,670
Nevermind, we are really good at this game.

381
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,910
No monkey.

382
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,510
No monkey.

383
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,350
Cute!

384
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,570
So cute!

385
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,510
Oh my gosh, he is so happy.

386
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,330
Was there an egg on that pillar?

387
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,090
How did you see that?

388
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,150
How do I get up there?

389
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,710
I think we must traverse this side.

390
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,090
Oh my goodness.

391
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:01,690
Oh my god.

392
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,410
I thought he was gonna sink us.

393
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,590
There is another person here.

394
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:06,730
Oh my god.

395
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,690
Am I about to fall off?

396
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,650
I need to pay attention.

397
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,070
Oh, she already beat these guys up.

398
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:12,970
Yeah, take them down.

399
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,810
No nonsense Merc.

400
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,470
Friend to the elephants.

401
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,340
Okay.

402
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,480
Okay, okay, okay.

403
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,820
Hold an egg.

404
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,520
My treasure.

405
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,180
Nice!

406
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,680
Yeah!

407
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,980
Nice, nice.

408
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
Oh my gosh.

409
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm gonna go on the Indiana Jones ride so bad right now.

410
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,180
Guys, I'm so excited for the Indiana Jones game.

411
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,540
I can't wait.

412
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,880
I can't wait, I can't wait.

413
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,320
Strange loves lab?

414
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,320
I guess kind of, maybe.

415
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,720
Yeah, you're right actually.

416
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,700
I can't wait.

417
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,440
Uncharted itself is very indie coded.

418
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,620
I love indie.

419
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,020
I love Indiana Jones!

420
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,020
Oh my gosh, these explode?

421
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,040
Oh my god!

422
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,540
Kill the frog!

423
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,140
No way, do I have to get the egg again?

424
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,080
Oh no, I have to get all the coins though.

425
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,520
Guys, we have to get all the coins because I'm trying to get snake stuff.

426
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,460
And snake skins too.

427
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,580
How many Uncharted games are there?

428
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,130
How many are there?

429
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,990
Four main line, two spin offs.

430
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,010
Six.

431
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,830
Five counting the one on the Vita.

432
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,770
Someone's counting the Vita?

433
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,690
Someone thought of the Vita in 2024?

434
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,110
Oh, there's a jeep up there.

435
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,390
I wanna drive it.

436
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,290
Okay guys, we gotta be fast with our shots here.

437
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,520
Okay, it's only like...

438
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,780
Like two coins over there, okay?

439
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,500
So it's fine if we just, you know...

440
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,580
I ran right into it.

441
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,820
Oh my gosh!

442
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,800
Oh my gosh!

443
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh my god, that was so close.

444
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,220
Are you okay, turtles?

445
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,320
So much for being able to drive the jeep like I wanted to.

446
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm so sorry.

447
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,420
They look so distressed.

448
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,940
It's so sad.

449
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,180
Oh my gosh, this game is freaking me out today.

450
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,360
Just give me the save point, please.

451
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,180
Can I save them?

452
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,960
Can I help them?

453
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm so sad for them.

454
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,620
The little guys look so distressed.

455
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,180
You guys think I should go back for those...

456
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,400
For those coins over there?

457
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,800
No, don't be greedy.

458
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,080
Don't be greedy.

459
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,040
Yeah.

460
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,370
Oh my gosh.

461
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,790
How do we...

462
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,410
Don't I have to like spin this guy?

463
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:08,850
Oh my gosh.

464
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,150
Can't see.

465
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,890
Yeah, there we go.

466
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,060
Look at these guys.

467
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,740
I gotcha, Minto.

468
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,580
I know.

469
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,080
Alright.

470
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,200
A tenacious reporter.

471
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,140
More valuable than any treasure.

472
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,340
Is she the romance?

473
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,680
What?

474
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,400
I wasn't ready!

475
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,640
I wasn't ready yet.

476
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,080
They can't get me through here, right?

477
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,400
Oh wow, I can hit the things mid...

478
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,060
Oh my gosh.

479
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,420
In mid-air.

480
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, take him down.

481
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,680
Take him down.

482
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,040
This place is like a mighty clean for Uncharted.

483
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,780
Is that true?

484
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,440
Is Uncharted a dirty, nasty place?

485
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,600
We're almost there to the big temple.

486
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,890
Bird, you have to get me out of here.

487
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,170
Okay.

488
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,790
How do I do this thing again?

489
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,690
Are you a geist just like me?

490
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,220
Oh my gosh.

491
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,160
Oh my gosh!

492
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,820
That was so close.

493
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,160
I nearly lost it.

494
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,060
I nearly died.

495
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,470
What's here?

496
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,530
Do I need to set these ablaze?

497
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,230
Do I touch this?

498
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,190
I'm scared.

499
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,070
I don't want to die.

500
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,770
This is so fun to run through.

501
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,910
What was this?

502
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,870
Oh, it's a rock.

503
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,350
Oh, nevermind.

504
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,150
We need to go the opposite way.

505
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,630
Punch punch, punch punch punch punch.

506
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,430
Okay.

507
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,770
Punch punch, punch punch punch punch.

508
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,750
I wonder if I spin punch it.

509
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,350
Punch punch punch punch...

510
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,950
Oh, I just need to push it.

511
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,850
It's so much... It's so much faster that way.

512
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,150
If I just push it...

513
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:23,690
Oopsie.

514
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,080
This looks ominous!

515
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:49,510
Why are these skulls wiggling and jiggling?

516
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,130
Look at all these guys.

517
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,990
There is something in there, that's why.

518
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,930
What is in here?

519
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,590
Oh, it's a thing.

520
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,770
Oh, there is also...

521
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,470
Puzzle piece!

522
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,310
Nathan Drake, toucher of things.

523
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,500
Oh,

524
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,360
I like these ones.

525
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,180
Because you guys can't tell, but I can feel it on my...

526
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,200
Oh, this one.

527
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,320
I can feel it on my controller.

528
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,360
Death to you!

529
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,460
Death to you!

530
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,520
Death to you!

531
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,600
They were already prisoners and I still... I killed them even more.

532
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,880
Oh gosh.

533
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,620
Walk in the plank.

534
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,500
OK, alright.

535
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,880
Forgot the PS5 controller had haptics like that.

536
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,380
Yeah, it feels so...

537
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,560
It's so... Oh my gosh.

538
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,260
So smooth.

539
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,780
What's all the way up here?

540
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,740
Oh, nothing.

541
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
It's so incredibly smooth.

542
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,240
Feels so good.

543
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,580
What's that?

544
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,120
Oh boy.

545
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,800
Oh gosh.

546
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,340
Yeah!

547
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,460
Oh gosh!

548
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:31,840
Oh gosh!

549
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,060
Wait, there was a guy behind me?

550
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,430
Thank you guys.

551
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,130
Oh my gosh, thank you guys.

552
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,690
How did you see that?

553
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,470
Actually though...

554
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,190
How did you see that?

555
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,530
It's an actual skilly man!

556
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,610
Oh, we heard it.

557
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,350
I thought I was hearing the other guy on the other side.

558
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:02,750
False ancestor.

559
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,290
Nathan?

560
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,650
Never heard of him.

561
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,570
Give me all of your money!

562
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,870
Yeah, I thought I was hearing that guy all the way.

563
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,410
I guess it's kind of...

564
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,910
I wish I could play this game on PC though.

565
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,660
Oh wait, did you guys notice?

566
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,060
That was a...

567
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,920
It was a... Oh my gosh.

568
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,040
It was a cord that you use for your controller.

569
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,320
Look, look, look.

570
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,760
Hold on.

571
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,630
Just saw a clip of the Nintendo redeem thingy.

572
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,350
So sweet, but you know what they say.

573
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,830
Chat reflects the streamer.

574
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,170
Prodigal brother.

575
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,130
Treasure hunting runs in the family.

576
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,090
We got them all!

577
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,150
Oh no, it disappeared.

578
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,890
I was going to show you guys.

579
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,650
Did you see it though?

580
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,610
Oh gosh!

581
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,310
Uh oh.

582
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,800
Wait, now you can see it.

583
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,360
See, see?

584
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,900
You can see the end.

585
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,800
This part is kind of crazy.

586
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,480
Oh my gosh.

587
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,940
That was close.

588
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,180
What the... What?

589
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,640
Oh my gosh, I almost...

590
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,150
We gotta be...

591
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,690
Oof.

592
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,270
They die so fast.

593
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,150
Oh my god.

594
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,050
Okay, I think we are alright-ish.

595
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:35,710
Okay.

596
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,610
Oh god.

597
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,910
Oh my god.

598
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,910
Jump!

599
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,890
Jump!

600
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,470
That was close.

601
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,190
Okay.

602
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,410
Hey!

603
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,430
This part is so tricky.

604
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,850
Oh gosh, oh gosh.

605
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,090
Okay.

606
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,190
Run, run, run, run!

607
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,010
Real platforming time.

608
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,350
Real platforming.

609
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,410
The water is so hilly.

610
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,250
What?

611
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,170
Are you kidding me?

612
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,430
I just touched the water like...

613
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,230
What?

614
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,610
I can't even get my feet wet.

615
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,190
What is this acid water?

616
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,300
The controls for the gun are a little weird.

617
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,460
Because if I spam it, it doesn't... It's like kind of timed almost.

618
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,360
So it's like...

619
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
So it's like a little...

620
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,140
Sometimes I can spam it, but I have to time it correctly.

621
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,280
In a way.

622
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,020
Oh my gosh.

623
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,440
And jump!

624
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,300
And jump!

625
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,440
Oh my gosh, okay.

626
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,500
Jump!

627
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,700
Oh my gosh.

628
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,480
Oh, nice, nice!

629
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:20,960
Okay.

630
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,120
Ah!

631
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,980
I got stuck on the...

632
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,820
Oh my god.

633
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,800
Indiana Jones time!

634
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,520
Oh my god.

635
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,640
Please.

636
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,280
Nice, nice.

637
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,100
We made it!

638
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,920
What's this?

639
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,560
It's a piece of my PS5 I think.

640
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,200
Oh, it's all wrapped up?

641
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
Oh, nevermind.

642
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,540
Maybe it's not...

643
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,360
Oh my god.

644
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,720
What the hell is this?

645
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,820
Oh, I think I need to be shooting at him.

646
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,470
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

647
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,270
Oh gosh.

648
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,150
I was too close to the top.

649
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,810
I was too close to the top.

650
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,170
Okay, we got this though.

651
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,970
Start blasting from early on.

652
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:54,570
I don't think actually blasting does anything.

653
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,710
Except for this part.

654
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:01,210
Okay.

655
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,210
Oh, that was close.

656
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,910
I'm blasting, I'm blasting, I'm blasting, I'm blasting!

657
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,790
I'm blasting, I'm blasting, I'm blasting, I'm blasting!

658
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,310
Oh nice.

659
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,950
Oh, that was close.

660
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,170
I'm blasting!

661
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,200
Dummy.

662
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,950
Rescue the ship part!

663
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,970
Wow, it's so tentacly.

664
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:54,650
Mothership's GPU accelerates, renders, processes and most importantly, sings!

665
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,330
Go on in.

666
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,550
We did it all, baby.

667
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,910
Nice.

668
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:11,790
The GPU.

669
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,430
Tentacle cutting time?

670
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,410
Wait, is that actually what we get to do?

671
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,150
I'm ready.

672
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,510
I'm ready to do science.

673
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,530
Science now, everybody.

674
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,870
Science.

675
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,870
Oh my goodness, you poor thing.

676
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,530
Okay.

677
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,830
Now I'm ready to pull...

678
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,910
Oh, we got our little chompers.

679
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:57,610
Chomp!

680
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,210
Chomp!

681
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:00,670
Chomp!

682
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:02,590
Chomp!

683
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,810
Oh my gosh, if I press the right one it does...you see that?

684
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,690
It does the right angle.

685
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,610
Chomp!

686
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:10,910
Chomp!

687
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,430
Chomp!

688
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:13,610
Chomp!

689
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,230
BabyCorn, thanks for the gift.

690
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,250
What's this?

691
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,570
The red one goes into the...

692
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,330
Red tube!

693
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,650
The green one goes into the...

694
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,810
Green tube!

695
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,270
The blue one goes...

696
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,150
Let's fit it right in there.

697
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,290
Blue tube!

698
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,570
It's RGB!

699
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,460
RGB!

700
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,600
Look at her, she's beautiful.

701
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,220
Square.

702
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,850
We just need one more?

703
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:25,640
GPU.

704
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,920
Oh my god, this song.

705
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,490
GPU.

706
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,740
Where's Snake?

707
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:38,580
GPU.

708
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,300
Wait, no, where's Snake?

709
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,440
Oh I see!

710
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,400
Oh my gosh, Johnny's combat and Psycho Mantis are right next to each other.

711
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,140
Psycho Mantis is flossing.

712
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,550
I don't think that's him...either.

713
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,420
I see...I see Gray Fox.

714
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,240
Where are you?

715
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,700
GPU.

716
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,400
GPU.

717
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,800
Oh my gosh, her family grows even larger.

718
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,120
So close...to elephant.

719
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,030
Snowy Land.

720
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,450
Everybody is waiting for me.

721
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,110
Oh my gosh.

722
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,310
Crash Site.

723
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,430
Ok, let's go check it out.

724
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,550
Let me turn around and slap you.

725
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:50,850
Hi Johnny's combat.

726
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,470
Where is Solid Snake?

727
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,910
Does he not love me anymore?

728
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,250
Look at all of them pointing.

729
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,310
They're so cute.

730
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,690
Does Solid Snake not love me anymore?

731
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:12,410
So sad.

732
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:14,890
Right?

733
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,270
Oh my gosh.

734
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:17,850
Ok, hold on.

735
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,670
I gotta get up.

736
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:21,150
Sorry, excuse me.

737
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,730
So sorry, excuse me.

738
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,440
200?

739
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,120
Wait, I have enough guys.

740
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,440
Why are you acting like that?

741
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,980
Or do...oh no, I have 161.

742
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,320
Just kidding.

743
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,820
So let's get back home.

744
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,540
Snowman.

745
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,300
Why is Freak Phantom 3.0 so cute?

746
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,720
I don't know.

747
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,620
Because Ayami Mama's art is so beautiful.

748
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,120
Thank you!

749
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,020
Love the performance art.

750
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,540
The various screens.

751
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,620
Also been waiting for Astro Continuation.

752
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,740
Me too!

753
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,260
Oh my goodness.

754
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,000
I can dig in this.

755
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,900
I can dig in the snow.

756
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,820
Oh gosh, this game is so satisfying.

757
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,580
That's one of my favorite things about it.

758
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,100
Just how satisfying it is.

759
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,200
Pinch your cheek?

760
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,200
Stop it.

761
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,590
No pinch, no pinch.

762
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,890
What do I do here?

763
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:42,670
Overlifting!

764
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,610
Oh my gosh, we got more guys.

765
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,330
OK.

766
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,630
Destroy!

767
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,050
Destroy!

768
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,190
We need 90 people here.

769
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:00,930
Gosh, there is so many.

770
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,950
I see that guy over there too.

771
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,310
What does this one do?

772
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,090
Oh, we are lifting up to go through there I think.

773
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,250
Hold on though.

774
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,950
I gotta get rid of these guys first.

775
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,790
Oh my gosh.

776
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:15,430
Oh my gosh.

777
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:17,030
How do I take care of this bird?

778
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,650
Oh shoot.

779
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:18,330
Wait.

780
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,730
I don't remember.

781
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,370
Oh, I see his head.

782
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:23,610
Grab it.

783
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,880
Just for one measly guy.

784
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,940
One little man.

785
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,580
Oh, I have to lift too.

786
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,040
Sorry.

787
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,280
I have to do my part.

788
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,040
Oh, OK.

789
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,880
Oh, my depth perception is...

790
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,040
OK, there we go.

791
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,780
Beautifully done.

792
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,960
Hi Mint.

793
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,280
Hello!

794
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,380
This area is huge.

795
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,280
Cute!

796
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,640
It's the controller cord again.

797
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,320
No, I haven't gotten Raiden yet.

798
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,520
I have not gotten Raiden yet.

799
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,060
Oh, where did you guys come from?

800
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,460
How did they do that?

801
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,360
Yippee!

802
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,680
Now we can go to another galaxy.

803
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,400
Oh, I guess we are going... Wait!

804
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,890
No, I didn't...

805
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,850
I don't want to go right now.

806
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,750
I wanted to... I opened up that other thing and I forgot to do it.

807
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:14,270
What galaxy are we opening up?

808
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,430
It's the Chameleon!

809
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,150
Lizard.

810
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,450
The Lizard Galaxy.

811
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,270
But before we go there...

812
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,150
Accidental progress.

813
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,490
Lizard Galaxy is fine.

814
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,310
This whole game is fine.

815
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,210
Where is the ice world?

816
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,450
There.

817
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:40,790
OK.

818
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,970
And we gotta do gacha.

819
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:48,030
You guys, once we get these guys over here, we'll do the gacha, OK?

820
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,130
Excuse me!

821
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,370
I wish to climb upon some men.

822
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,290
Oh my god.

823
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,730
It's all normies.

824
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,890
It's all little normie guys.

825
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,020
What parts did we not get?

826
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,340
Oh!

827
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,880
There is a guy right here.

828
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,120
I completely missed him.

829
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,890
He was just chilling here.

830
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,630
Thank you!

831
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:27,390
Nice.

832
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:29,930
I just never got that guy.

833
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,450
And we need to do this one.

834
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:38,050
I need 100 men to help me.

835
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,480
Group effort.

836
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:48,100
And I need 90 more men to help me once again.

837
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,080
I'm doing my part.

838
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:54,960
Oh!

839
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,500
What the hell?

840
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,220
How does this work?

841
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,480
How do I not lose the momentum?

842
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,220
Wait.

843
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,180
How do I not lose the momentum here?

844
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:18,620
Huh?

845
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,820
Reajuu bakuhatsu shiro.

846
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,960
Hold right when jumping?

847
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,630
I do try.

848
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:37,370
I do try though.

849
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:43,010
I'm even holding up even to like...

850
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:46,630
Don't double.

851
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,310
I wasn't...

852
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,910
I'm not double jumping.

853
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,130
Maybe from this... From this side?

854
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,290
Just right.

855
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,190
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

856
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:04,790
Oh wait.

857
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:05,530
There we go.

858
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,660
We're good.

859
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,620
We got it.

860
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,460
I can't see anything.

861
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,040
Magical egg.

862
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,890
A flower.

863
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,050
Restorative flora.

864
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,210
Carries nature's healing touch.

865
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:30,650
I got a flower.

866
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,110
Destroy.

867
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:34,570
Destroy.

868
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,370
Oh, the penguins hold money.

869
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,090
See, this is why you destroy everything, you guys.

870
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:40,930
Is there anything else?

871
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,230
There you go.

872
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,690
You see that egg up there?

873
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,890
And we got this.

874
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,030
And I need 80 guys for...

875
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,170
Oh my gosh.

876
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,830
Crash Bandicoot scared me.

877
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,550
What the...

878
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,490
Did you see all of them?

879
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:18,550
Easy now.

880
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:21,470
Wow.

881
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,230
Wow.

882
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:22,950
Easy, easy.

883
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,590
Easy, easy.

884
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:26,510
Easy, easy.

885
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,430
We got this.

886
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,910
Slow and steady.

887
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:30,370
Come on.

888
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,250
Oh my god, the bird is holding on to him.

889
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:35,670
Easy, easy.

890
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,210
Easy, easy.

891
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,250
Good pace.

892
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,090
We're OK.

893
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,430
Everything is fine.

894
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:48,670
OK Oh my gosh!

895
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:50,590
Stop.

896
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,270
Is this Tokyo Jungle?

897
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,870
Stop it right now!

898
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:57,850
You guys!

899
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,170
Urban Survivors think it's a Tokyo Jungle dog!

900
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:03,810
Oh my gosh!

901
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,550
The cutest little predator!

902
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,230
Oh my god!

903
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,550
That's so fun!

904
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:16,930
I didn't know that they would be in this game too!

905
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,510
Oh my gosh!

906
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,650
That's so fun!

907
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,710
Alright, we're gonna have to come back for this 200 here.

908
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:28,290
Whatever it does.

909
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:31,030
I feel like we've gotten everything here, but...

910
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,910
Clearly not.

911
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,120
I love Tokyo Jungle.

912
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,310
Need to play Tokyo Jungle.

913
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,290
It's so fun.

914
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,410
Such a good game.

915
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,570
Let's grab some more money before we...

916
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,450
And...

917
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,170
Where is the other guy?

918
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,130
Grab some more money.

919
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,010
And gotcha time.

920
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,750
You can check the map too here.

921
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,410
There are some golds in here.

922
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,470
Crush!

923
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,370
Chartered territory.

924
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,770
There be treasure.

925
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:30,950
Snake.

926
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,650
Pirate outfit.

927
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,030
Snake.

928
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,130
Colorful dice.

929
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,530
Oh cute!

930
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,050
Snake.

931
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,310
Hold on.

932
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:01,550
Hold on.

933
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,410
All sorts of creatures.

934
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,750
Even snakes!

935
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,370
I see you in there.

936
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,130
I want his outfit too though.

937
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,010
Is this a color for our ship?

938
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,030
Neon dream.

939
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:20,550
Wow!

940
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,170
It's really pretty.

941
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,370
I like this one.

942
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:25,210
One more.

943
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,330
Outfit.

944
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,350
Gran Turismo!

945
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:34,850
Awesome.

946
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:37,470
Good haul this time guys.

947
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,650
Nice.

948
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,250
Let's go change this.

949
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,210
Wait, do we have almost all the...

950
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:58,870
All the colors?

951
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:00,870
Is this the one we just got?

952
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,490
Yeah, I love this one.

953
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:04,570
John Turismo.

954
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,530
Nice.

955
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:12,190
Go see snake, of course.

956
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,650
We also must change.

957
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:15,630
No more Bloodborne, sorry.

958
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,450
I'm now...

959
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:19,510
John Turismo.

960
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:20,310
Let's go.

961
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:24,990
It's so cute!

962
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,750
Why do I look so chubby?

963
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,330
I feel like I look chubbier than usual.

964
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,590
Than in the other outfits.

965
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,690
I don't know why it looks so puffy in this one.

966
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:42,190
It's the helmet?

967
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,230
It must be, right?

968
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,110
Oh my gosh.

969
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,510
What an area.

970
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,360
It's his...

971
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:59,350
Stop it!

972
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,630
Oh my gosh, the banana!

973
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,750
Oh my god.

974
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,610
Oh my gosh!

975
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,370
I'm so happy!

976
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:24,820
Oh my gosh.

977
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,750
This one is so silly.

978
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,110
He's like, no, don't eat my food.

979
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,050
This one is my favorite though.

980
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:37,850
Of course, a croc.

981
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,070
Look at his little crawl!

982
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:49,090
It's so good.

983
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,850
So good, I love a croc hat.

984
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,010
Oh wait, this isn't...

985
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,510
Where is...

986
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:01,890
Is this?

987
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,550
No, that's not the flower we got.

988
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:05,630
Where is Tokyo Jungle Dog?

989
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,150
I wonder.

990
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,010
I want to get pyramid heads too.

991
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,810
He's following me!

992
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,070
Our little island is so...

993
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,170
Our little island is so active now.

994
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,270
He recovers so well.

995
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,050
He does the same thing as Snake.

996
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,710
Yeah, it's so lively.

997
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,250
Where is...

998
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:51,950
Where is...Oh there he is!

999
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,380
Are you going to do anything?

1000
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,480
Oh he also follows me!

1001
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,140
Pressing down next to Crash?

1002
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,480
What do you mean pressing down?

1003
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,280
Where is Crash?

1004
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,560
Like Crash Bandicoot?

1005
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,480
Where is that guy?

1006
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,860
Oh, there is Spyro.

1007
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,180
Crash.

1008
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:28,630
Oh there he is.

1009
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,880
Our area is so lively.

1010
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,640
There is a lot that I haven't checked out yet.

1011
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,540
Oh my gosh!

1012
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,300
So cute!

1013
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:56,420
Creepy!

1014
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,420
Was

1015
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,050
that a look card?

1016
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:15,990
I'm pretty sure it was.

1017
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,270
The Sushi.

1018
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:26,090
You deserve all the success.

1019
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:26,850
Thank you!

1020
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,210
Alright.

1021
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,570
New galaxy time?

1022
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:37,210
New galaxy time?

1023
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,670
Either Alucard or Cain.

1024
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,710
Oh it's Cain from Legacy of Cain.

1025
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,190
There was Alucard though, wasn't there?

1026
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,610
Is Raiden in this one?

1027
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:55,330
Wasn't he?

1028
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:57,590
This one?

1029
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,470
I think?

1030
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:03,490
What's this one?

1031
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,350
Rolling Star Luna?

1032
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,030
Let's try diving in here.

1033
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,550
Real quick.

1034
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:28,630
Alright.

1035
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,560
Oh my god.

1036
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,220
Oh my god.

1037
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,120
Ouch!

1038
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,820
OK, don't double jump everybody.

1039
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,560
No double jump.

1040
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,040
So fast!

1041
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,520
It's so fast!

1042
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,000
OK, maybe I don't go for the coins.

1043
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,000
Don't be greedy maybe.

1044
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,020
Oh gosh!

1045
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,580
It's so fast!

1046
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,240
My guy came back!

1047
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,760
How the hell?

1048
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:02,700
Nice.

1049
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,180
OK.

1050
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,200
Gotta jump fast.

1051
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,240
Can I jump with this guy on though?

1052
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,080
Oh yes, OK, OK.

1053
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,260
Oh my gosh.

1054
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,280
OK, OK.

1055
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,180
The music in this is so...

1056
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,980
Look at those little dragons!

1057
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:20,600
At the sleepy moon.

1058
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,340
This is such a cute level.

1059
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,120
I'm appreciating it a little bit real quick.

1060
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,540
Look at the way they are running.

1061
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,670
OK, I gotta jump fast.

1062
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,660
Oh gosh!

1063
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:56,060
How do I do this one?

1064
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,320
We gotta be balanced.

1065
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,100
Oh gosh.

1066
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,500
OK, I might take it slow and steady perhaps.

1067
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,460
Oh my god.

1068
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,520
OK, OK.

1069
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,940
Monkey ball, kind of, maybe.

1070
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:13,780
Oh my gosh.

1071
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,280
No, no!

1072
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,560
I know we can do this one.

1073
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,600
I know we can do this one.

1074
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,120
It's just... Oh my gosh.

1075
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,380
It's just maybe a little bit of patience, I think.

1076
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,820
Maybe if I launch, if I kick the...

1077
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:45,020
If I kick the armadillo...

1078
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,660
At him, we should be OK.

1079
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:47,980
I think.

1080
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,900
If I kick it at him...

1081
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,040
And then run and be careful, you know?

1082
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:52,840
OK.

1083
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:00,420
Like that.

1084
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,940
Oh gosh, it spooks me though.

1085
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,440
Like this, right?

1086
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,680
You think I can kick him from here?

1087
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:21,380
No, not far enough.

1088
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,260
Come here, guy!

1089
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,840
Will he follow?

1090
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,960
Yeah, he does.

1091
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,730
That was so close!

1092
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:39,610
Holy moly!

1093
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:41,770
That was so close!

1094
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,930
Oh gosh, it's slowly but surely turning.

1095
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,790
Wait, come back to me.

1096
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,070
We are safe on here, so...

1097
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:03,550
Oh gosh.

1098
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:07,930
OK, OK.

1099
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:08,670
Nice, nice.

1100
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:10,310
Alright, alright, alright.

1101
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:14,190
I scared him!

1102
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,420
We got him!

1103
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,420
He's Streetwise Cat!

1104
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,080
A kitty of many vices.

1105
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,400
Isn't this the other cat from...

1106
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:36,420
I got the other guy.

1107
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,740
I can't remember, I'm sorry.

1108
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,900
Yeah, we did it!

1109
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,800
That's not Raiden.

1110
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,840
No way!

1111
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:50,840
Are you sure?

1112
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,260
Are you sure that's not Raiden?

1113
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,440
There's a bunch of other ones actually in here.

1114
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,320
What's this one?

1115
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,040
What is this?

1116
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,600
Swinging Sentries?

1117
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,440
Is Raiden the last...

1118
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,380
The last...

1119
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,060
Metal Gear in this game?

1120
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:11,860
Who the hell are you?

1121
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:22,320
Congrats on the 3.0!

1122
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,960
I had to catch the re-debut VOD, but I loved it.

1123
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,240
Thank you, Nevermore!

1124
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,140
No worries about even watching the VOD.

1125
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,840
OK, this one's Raiden.

1126
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,600
Guys, this one is really hard though.

1127
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,920
This is really hard though.

1128
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:49,260
I don't quite remember how to do it, even.

1129
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:56,170
Oh gosh, OK.

1130
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:14,850
OK.

1131
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:17,070
OK.

1132
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:23,180
Alright.

1133
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,660
OK, OK.

1134
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,020
I remember this last part was the one that caused me the most trouble.

1135
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,020
I think I just have to swing and...

1136
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,080
Oh, it was like I just have to swing and...

1137
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,840
Like, I can't even... I can't delay.

1138
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,600
I have to just swing and jump and...

1139
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,320
Swing and jump immediately.

1140
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,440
It's the part that causes me... Yeah, I gotta go really fast.

1141
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:47,680
Oh.

1142
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:57,620
Oh god.

1143
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,330
We got here.

1144
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:13,610
First try.

1145
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,210
OK.

1146
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:22,290
I haven't been able to get past this part.

1147
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:23,450
I'm scared.

1148
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:23,590
I'm scared.

1149
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:28,620
Yeah.

1150
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,910
I got killed by the easiest freaking enemy.

1151
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:39,950
No.

1152
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,910
I got killed by the easiest freaking guy.

1153
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:50,430
No.

1154
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,490
That's so embarrassing.

1155
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:56,850
I'm so sorry, guys.

1156
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:05,640
Oh my goodness.

1157
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,120
Oh.

1158
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:14,640
OK.

1159
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,240
I did get that first try though.

1160
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,100
Isn't that kind of crazy?

1161
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,840
Isn't that kind of crazy?

1162
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,490
Shoot the...

1163
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:46,470
I tried jumping again, but it wouldn't let me.

1164
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:48,470
It wouldn't let me.

1165
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:00,210
Nice shoot.

1166
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:02,230
Oh.

1167
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,730
Gosh, that was so close.

1168
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,610
We can do it.

1169
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:29,730
Nice.

1170
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:30,370
OK.

1171
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,010
OK.

1172
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,070
There we go.

1173
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,410
I wish there was a save point here.

1174
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,210
I wish there was a save point.

1175
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,710
What is going... OK, hold on.

1176
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:49,790
OK, so I jump onto that platform moving...

1177
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,930
And then I somehow get to that guy moving too...

1178
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,910
And then I jump, and then I jump, and then I...

1179
01:15:55,650 --> 01:16:00,010
There's spikes and other guys flying...

1180
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,710
And then, the end, at the very end...

1181
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,620
What is he doing?

1182
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,680
Oh, he's...

1183
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,560
He's playing on...

1184
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,020
Is that PSP or Vita?

1185
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,040
OK.

1186
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:23,540
Alright.

1187
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,420
You mastered the hard part.

1188
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,300
I don't know if that was the hard part.

1189
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,540
Oh my god.

1190
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,340
Oh my gosh.

1191
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,550
It goes so fast.

1192
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,380
How am I supposed to...

1193
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:51,780
Get there?

1194
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,380
I want... Oh, that was so...

1195
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,000
Close.

1196
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,840
Oh gosh.

1197
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:03,940
What?

1198
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:12,560
Guys...

1199
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,700
I don't know if I have the patience for this right now.

1200
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,860
But we must get Raiden.

1201
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,780
I said I would get him today.

1202
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:29,990
That was so...

1203
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:31,790
Dirty.

1204
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,250
Of you...

1205
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:36,110
Oh my goodness.

1206
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,960
Poor Raiden is never getting saved.

1207
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,280
No!

1208
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,300
I'll save him.

1209
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:47,640
I'll do it.

1210
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,640
OK.

1211
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,760
Next round.

1212
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,200
That was...

1213
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:56,940
Close.

1214
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,820
I double jumped.

1215
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,660
I did.

1216
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,240
I did.

1217
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,280
I double jumped.

1218
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,980
Holy moly.

1219
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:21,950
Reflexes of steel, baby.

1220
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:27,510
Oh my god.

1221
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,300
Save him and then slap him.

1222
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,320
Why does he have the hardest level?

1223
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:41,580
This guy.

1224
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,920
This hecking guy.

1225
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,600
Some of these challenge levels are...

1226
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,200
Some of these challenge levels are no joke for real.

1227
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,500
Is it possible to grab him before the end of the map?

1228
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,260
I don't think so.

1229
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:58,280
They wouldn't make it like that.

1230
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:14,960
OK.

1231
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:15,620
Oh my gosh.

1232
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,690
This one is so tricky.

1233
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,310
Raiden!

1234
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:26,910
Why do I have to love you so much?

1235
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:28,070
Oh my god.

1236
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:36,490
OK.

1237
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:46,800
OK.

1238
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,420
We made it to here.

1239
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:49,820
Yippee!

1240
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:50,180
OK.

1241
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,940
We made it to here.

1242
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:52,800
We made it to here.

1243
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:56,180
This part is really...

1244
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,320
Wow-y though.

1245
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,400
Oh gosh.

1246
01:19:59,500 --> 01:19:59,720
OK.

1247
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,520
I think it's because I'm like scared of him shooting at me, you know?

1248
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,790
What are you doing with that mem...

1249
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:17,550
He's blowing into the memory card!

1250
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:18,250
No!

1251
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,350
You're not supposed to do that!

1252
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:21,870
OK.

1253
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,300
Flame!

1254
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,400
Thanks for the ping!

1255
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,760
You can do it.

1256
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,920
No checkpoints now.

1257
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:32,340
There's no checkpoints in these.

1258
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,560
Because they're pretty short.

1259
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,120
It's just you gotta be good.

1260
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:46,450
Oh my god.

1261
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,090
It

1262
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:52,950
doesn't recognize my double jump sometimes.

1263
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:17,750
I'm just gonna stick with this one.

1264
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:58,980
OK.

1265
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,800
This might be my last try for now.

1266
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,860
Holy moly.

1267
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:40,850
I hate that part.

1268
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:43,130
I hate it.

1269
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:11,110
I hate these guys!

1270
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:12,810
I hate them!

1271
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:16,570
I wish them all a very horrible night!

1272
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,010
I hope...

1273
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,690
I hope they suffer forever!

1274
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:25,730
Oh my god.

1275
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:40,210
Oh gosh.

1276
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:42,190
I registered it.

1277
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,250
Oh my gosh.

1278
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:44,270
I registered it.

1279
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,960
Suffer little slime blobs!

1280
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:13,170
No!

1281
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,390
Suffer slime blobs.

1282
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:25,490
Slime blobs!

1283
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,350
Slime blobs!

1284
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:35,630
I'm gonna take my frustrations out on this plant.

1285
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,170
Oh gosh.

1286
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,130
I guess she doesn't...

1287
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:47,110
What do you mean?

1288
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,110
I'm trying.

1289
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,330
I've been at this for like an hour.

1290
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:57,230
Oh gosh.

1291
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,970
It moves so fast.

1292
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:06,350
It moves so fast and he spits...

1293
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:08,070
He spits so deadly!

1294
01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:11,090
Oh gosh.

1295
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:11,330
OK.

1296
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:15,970
We're like 15 minutes.

1297
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:19,430
Wait, it's only been 10 minutes?

1298
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:20,450
No, it hasn't.

1299
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,250
It's been way longer than 10 minutes, right?

1300
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:32,410
It's been about 15... Wait, now people are saying 20 minutes.

1301
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:47,810
20... Wait, now it says 25 minutes!

1302
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:50,590
You guys are just like those...

1303
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:54,910
When you go to a theme park and it's like estimated 20 minutes...

1304
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:58,510
And then it's like 45 minutes later and you're like...

1305
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,450
We believe in you.

1306
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,230
Don

1307
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:11,610
Teresimo, wake up!

1308
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:21,570
He is freaking dead.

1309
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:23,490
Oh, that's a shadow.

1310
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,780
He died of old age.

1311
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:45,830
He... He truly is the end.

1312
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,890
Oh gosh, you guys, I have no...

1313
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,990
I have no confidence in this part!

1314
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:03,770
Confidence!

1315
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:06,270
I have no confidence!

1316
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,880
Come to me!

1317
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:37,550
You gotta change to the pirate outfit.

1318
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:38,010
No!

1319
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:39,250
Oh, look at us.

1320
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,250
We're wobbling.

1321
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,010
We're wobbling.

1322
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:58,690
Oh!

1323
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:11,900
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1324
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,480
I'm back.

1325
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:01,340
But I don't wanna be!

1326
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:11,420
Yeah, I was an angry pee.

1327
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,840
I don't wanna be back.

1328
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:17,440
I'm so tired.

1329
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,140
I'm so tired of this whole freaking round!

1330
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,080
Screw you!

1331
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,160
Little blob!

1332
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:31,420
I can't believe I survived all of what the chameleon was throwing at me.

1333
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:37,560
Just for... Just for me to die falling off the edge!

1334
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,880
It's too cruel!

1335
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,620
This game is too cruel!

1336
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,910
The satisfaction when you win though...

1337
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,100
We'll hope... We'll hope for a win, man.

1338
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,600
This is the real... Oh my gosh.

1339
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:02,080
This is like the real...

1340
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:07,940
This is the real good hours of this game, man.

1341
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:14,390
Okay, we're back.

1342
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:16,490
We're back here.

1343
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:23,150
We got here pretty quickly actually.

1344
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:25,910
Hold on, let me drink some water.

1345
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:28,990
I've been trying to drink a lot more water recently because...

1346
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,890
And like less... Not that I drink a ton of caffeine.

1347
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:37,210
But I'm trying to drink more water because I... Recently I've been getting like...

1348
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:41,170
I don't know if it's like just from staring at the computer screen too much, but...

1349
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:43,210
Like a lot of headaches behind my eyes.

1350
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:51,560
So...

1351
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,880
No, not with Auras, no.

1352
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:56,020
I've never had an Auras...

1353
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:57,900
Headache before.

1354
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,700
No, I don't think it's caffeine withdrawal.

1355
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,480
I don't know though.

1356
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,080
I've been just trying to drink a lot of water.

1357
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,280
I think it might be...

1358
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,020
It might be just staring at a computer screen for so long.

1359
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,560
There's a reason this BGM is called Perseverance.

1360
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,900
Ganbamito, thank you.

1361
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,330
Might be the change of seasons.

1362
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:31,570
Oh, maybe, that too.

1363
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:33,550
Peanut butter withdrawal.

1364
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:39,690
Peanut butter.

1365
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:49,810
That was so close.

1366
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:53,070
Oh, that was so close!

1367
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,870
Kill him!

1368
01:35:57,150 --> 01:35:57,950
Kill him dead!

1369
01:35:58,590 --> 01:35:58,790
Okay.

1370
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:00,810
We killed him dead.

1371
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:02,530
We killed him dead.

1372
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:17,610
Oh my gosh!

1373
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:25,450
Yes!

1374
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,530
Oh my god!

1375
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:28,790
Oh my god, we're so close!

1376
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,650
He's right there!

1377
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,790
He's right there!

1378
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:33,350
Please, god, please!

1379
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:34,330
Please!

1380
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,330
Oh please, please!

1381
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:53,860
Mountain buster!

1382
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,440
Nanomachine inside!

1383
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:01,980
Raiden, welcome home!

1384
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:11,990
I'll match you.

1385
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,310
I'll match you, kind of.

1386
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:16,030
It looks funky with my sunglasses on though.

1387
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:24,450
Oh my gosh, and this is supposed to be November.

1388
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:24,750
November?

1389
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:29,030
Ducky, thanks for the 10 gifts!

1390
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:34,590
Oh my gosh!

1391
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,490
Never doubt it.

1392
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:40,950
Thanks for the pink, Octo!

1393
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:44,510
Let's go see him.

1394
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:47,030
Oh, Mappy!

1395
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:48,430
Thanks for the pink!

1396
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:50,910
Mintos stream on my birthday!

1397
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:56,410
Happy birthday to you!

1398
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:59,190
Happy birthday to you!

1399
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:02,210
Happy birthday, Mappy Rose!

1400
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:06,930
Happy birthday to you!

1401
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:10,710
Happy birthday!

1402
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:12,350
Thank you!

1403
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,170
Sirstreak, thanks for the 5 gifted.

1404
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:19,110
I can relax.

1405
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:21,610
Oh my god, there he is!

1406
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:23,050
Oh, he's with all of them!

1407
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:24,590
Oh my god, I'm gonna cry!

1408
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:26,550
No, they're so cute!

1409
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:30,030
I think his gacha will probably be...

1410
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:33,310
I was gonna say his sword, but it probably is...

1411
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:37,110
It's probably Sam's sword.

1412
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:39,590
How much money did I even get from that anyway?

1413
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,570
Probably not a lot.

1414
01:38:43,610 --> 01:38:45,690
Yeah, I don't even have enough.

1415
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:46,790
Get me out of here.

1416
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:49,370
I don't even have enough to do a single pull.

1417
01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:51,930
Oh my gosh.

1418
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:56,470
Oh my god, I'm so out of breath from that.

1419
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:05,180
We can finally continue the game.

1420
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,440
I never want to do another challenge level ever.

1421
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:10,760
I'm so tired.

1422
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,320
Wait, how much is left in this?

1423
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,860
We missed a puzzle piece?

1424
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:20,600
Where?

1425
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,900
We've got all the puzzle pieces here.

1426
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,480
We just missed some challenge guys I think there.

1427
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,880
Oh, and even in the gorilla!

1428
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,640
Oh my gosh.

1429
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:35,440
Well, I never intended on 100%ing this game, so...

1430
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,820
It's okay if I do or don't, you know, whatever.

1431
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:38,600
Cool.

1432
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:41,560
No!

1433
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,660
They're playing cat...

1434
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:46,360
Don't bully him!

1435
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:49,080
You nasty alien, you!

1436
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:59,540
We got the metal gears.

1437
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,240
I think that's the most important.

1438
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,440
Probably.

1439
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:13,880
Watermelon.

1440
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,810
Our ship is gone.

1441
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:24,980
Don't do it.

1442
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:26,780
I'm sick of you guys.

1443
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:27,560
I'm so...

1444
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,340
I'm so sick of you.

1445
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,000
Your nastiness.

1446
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,920
I'm sick of you blowing at me.

1447
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,380
I'm sick of it.

1448
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,180
I'm tired of it.

1449
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,520
Oh my god, where the hell are you guys?

1450
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:41,860
Oh, they're on me!

1451
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:42,580
Oh shoot!

1452
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:44,100
Hold on!

1453
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,600
There we go.

1454
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:46,480
That was close.

1455
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,080
Oh my gosh.

1456
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:49,700
I forgot about those guys.

1457
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,950
I'm still out of breath.

1458
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:12,770
I'm still so out of breath, man.

1459
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:15,470
I'm still like reeling from...

1460
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:19,070
I'm still reeling from the...

1461
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:23,250
I'm like, my mind is empty.

1462
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:26,270
It's a pulse ride in clarity, maybe.

1463
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:27,370
There's more.

1464
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:33,130
It was intense.

1465
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:34,990
It was.

1466
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:36,770
I'm so glad that we could defeat it.

1467
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:39,630
Thanks guys for not giving up.

1468
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:40,670
For believing in me.

1469
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:40,990
Oh!

1470
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:52,470
Leah!

1471
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,270
Welcome to Mambo Show!

1472
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:56,150
Stop!

1473
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:57,070
What the heck?

1474
01:42:04,050 --> 01:42:09,950
Leah is one who helped with my lore video.

1475
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:12,850
Thank you!

1476
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:16,470
Nice.

1477
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:19,110
Just before he could regenerate.

1478
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:23,490
Nice.

1479
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:26,110
I heard a guy though, I'm pretty sure.

1480
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:27,210
Oh my goodness.

1481
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,430
Oh shoot!

1482
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:31,110
Holy moly.

1483
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:36,530
How the heck am I supposed to...

1484
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:37,970
I thought I heard a guy.

1485
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:38,810
Maybe I'm wrong.

1486
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:40,690
I

1487
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,780
think I figured it out.

1488
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:51,620
Buzzsaw guy goes hard.

1489
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:52,280
For real!

1490
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,160
Oh, I got him.

1491
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,720
I don't know what I did, but I did it.

1492
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,700
I thought I heard a guy.

1493
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,580
Welcome to the team, little bot.

1494
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:15,300
I feel like soon we're gonna have enough to...

1495
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:18,220
Oh, no, I wanted to... Wait, hold on.

1496
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:19,460
You too.

1497
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:24,040
Soon we're gonna have enough to be able to do that...

1498
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:26,880
What's the word?

1499
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,600
The one that required 200 bots.

1500
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:32,660
Oh my god.

1501
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:34,600
Evil.

1502
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,240
Evil game.

1503
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,000
This game is so evil sometimes.

1504
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:42,740
Nice.

1505
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:47,510
Nice.

1506
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:49,650
I knew that was gonna happen.

1507
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:50,190
It's okay.

1508
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:52,390
200 thing.

1509
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:54,330
Yeah, whatever it was in that snowy area.

1510
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:02,890
Nice.

1511
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:06,770
Oh, there's a lot of save checkpoints here in this area though.

1512
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:08,990
It's actually quite...

1513
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:11,250
Quite nice.

1514
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,990
Only the challenge levels are so evil.

1515
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:16,710
But the game itself is not so mean.

1516
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,110
Hmm...

1517
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:27,030
Checking for any hiddens.

1518
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:30,250
If I miss anything, just yell at me, okay?

1519
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:32,710
Just say... I see, I hear one.

1520
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:33,790
I hear a guy going...

1521
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,790
Where are you?

1522
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,190
Where are you?

1523
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:41,870
Show yourself!

1524
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:46,010
I keep it funky.

1525
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:48,010
Oh my god.

1526
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:51,170
He keeps it funky.

1527
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:53,010
He keeps it funky.

1528
01:44:56,130 --> 01:44:56,650
Yeah.

1529
01:44:58,210 --> 01:44:59,030
Keeps it funky.

1530
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:00,810
He made me above.

1531
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:01,170
True.

1532
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:07,270
Oh my goodness!

1533
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:09,990
Is that who I... Wait, did my...

1534
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:12,950
My big head might have...

1535
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:16,470
My big head might have hidden who that was, I think.

1536
01:45:19,050 --> 01:45:19,730
Hmm...

1537
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:20,410
Sneaky.

1538
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:22,050
Oh my gosh.

1539
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:23,170
Sexy maiden.

1540
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:25,170
Missing Lara Croft!

1541
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,010
Hot dog, indeed!

1542
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:30,230
Righty, thank you!

1543
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:31,590
Congrats on getting right in.

1544
01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:32,850
That was some real perseverance.

1545
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,730
Yeah!

1546
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:37,310
Hot dog, indeed, baby!

1547
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:39,930
Aristocratic archaeologist.

1548
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:42,170
A Brit of an icon.

1549
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:45,110
Look at her!

1550
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:47,350
Uh-oh.

1551
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:54,680
We're sneaky.

1552
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:56,620
We're sneaky.

1553
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:01,440
That's so fun.

1554
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:05,320
That's so fun.

1555
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,220
Oh, now I have to jump off.

1556
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,020
Oh, okay, interesting.

1557
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,010
I'm greedy.

1558
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:18,370
It's okay.

1559
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:19,450
I'm greedy.

1560
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:21,930
Oh, nice.

1561
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:23,630
That was a close one.

1562
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:30,990
I keep it funky.

1563
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:32,790
I keep it funky funky.

1564
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:35,050
I keep it funky Friday.

1565
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:35,970
Freaky funky funky.

1566
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:38,590
I keep it funky Friday.

1567
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:40,090
I keep it so funky.

1568
01:46:40,610 --> 01:46:41,130
What's this?

1569
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:43,330
What is this?

1570
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:47,790
I hear a guy crying!

1571
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,870
I hear... Oh, he's up there!

1572
01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:52,450
How do I...?

1573
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,760
Gotta get the power-up first.

1574
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,160
Oh, I see, I see.

1575
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,140
Is it here?

1576
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:04,420
Power-up!

1577
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:15,090
Oh, I guess the power-up is over there.

1578
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:15,510
Nevermind.

1579
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:23,340
Money.

1580
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,540
Oh my gosh, this is so satisfying.

1581
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:29,420
Oh my gosh, look at this.

1582
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:30,900
Oh god, this game.

1583
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,680
I feel like this is gonna ruin my bit right now.

1584
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:35,420
Sorry to the stream.

1585
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:37,220
Sorry to the stream.

1586
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:01,130
Okay, let's let him out.

1587
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:05,050
We got our big boy panties on now.

1588
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:05,650
Oh no.

1589
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:07,850
What is this?

1590
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,640
Oh god!

1591
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,140
Why?

1592
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:35,030
Get out of here.

1593
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:39,010
Oh, and it helps us get into small spaces too.

1594
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:43,710
Interesting indeed.

1595
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:45,530
What's here?

1596
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:50,230
Nothing, I guess.

1597
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:53,570
It kinda looks like a spot though, doesn't it?

1598
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:57,550
I'm a little ball.

1599
01:48:58,150 --> 01:48:58,530
Oh!

1600
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:06,310
Fujisan, my beloved!

1601
01:49:07,070 --> 01:49:08,070
And now we can go in here.

1602
01:49:08,110 --> 01:49:08,970
I noticed this earlier.

1603
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:11,130
I was like, oh, it's a little way.

1604
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:15,710
Guys, I think I'm a genius.

1605
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:17,810
I freed you, snake!

1606
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,280
I just saw this version of you.

1607
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:25,040
It looks fantastic.

1608
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:26,000
Thank you!

1609
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:31,920
Sure is not Chilean volcano.

1610
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:35,640
I'm pretty sure it's Fujisan.

1611
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:45,870
No!

1612
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:47,750
Take me back!

1613
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:52,550
I didn't get the guy over there.

1614
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:56,830
Oh, there's a ladder here.

1615
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,960
You guys, coming back was a good thing.

1616
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,300
Money, baby!

1617
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,360
Actually, nevermind.

1618
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,780
The WFC music!

1619
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,300
Welcome to Babushan!

1620
01:50:14,660 --> 01:50:15,440
Thank you!

1621
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,320
Thank you.

1622
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:19,760
I'm glad you like the new look.

1623
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:25,330
Guys, I think I screamed a little much.

1624
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:28,850
A little too much.

1625
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:30,650
What is this doing?

1626
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:33,670
Where is this guy?

1627
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:38,450
This game is so nice, isn't it?

1628
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:44,120
I don't understand this power-up.

1629
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:02,940
I think I screamed too much a little bit earlier.

1630
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,520
Now my throat hurts.

1631
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:14,320
This game really does think of a lot of stuff like that bird there.

1632
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,080
It'll be like, oh yeah, you probably wanted to go back if you missed that.

1633
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:19,600
I'll give you a little shortcut.

1634
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,620
It's actually so nice.

1635
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,280
What the hell is that thing though?

1636
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,340
I think

1637
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,260
I know what to do.

1638
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:40,820
Come here.

1639
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:45,280
Suck me up, baby.

1640
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:53,110
This is so fun!

1641
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:54,310
Evil vacuum.

1642
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:57,850
Mothman.

1643
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:01,410
Mothman.

1644
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:02,170
Nice.

1645
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:02,510
OK.

1646
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:04,010
Oh, these guys?

1647
01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:04,770
No, no, no.

1648
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:06,870
Wait, how do I be sneaky through here?

1649
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:10,070
Oh, just like this?

1650
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:18,550
I'm like invincible with this guy, basically.

1651
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:19,710
Oh my god.

1652
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:20,750
Are you OK?

1653
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:22,810
Oh no!

1654
01:52:27,870 --> 01:52:29,710
Third and final puzzle piece.

1655
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:32,970
Click, click, click.

1656
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:34,410
I don't like pants, Mothman.

1657
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:38,610
I think I'm a genius, you guys.

1658
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:41,810
Nice.

1659
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:46,030
Who's here?

1660
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:47,250
Oh my gosh!

1661
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:48,490
Oh my gosh.

1662
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:53,930
Kick him!

1663
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:55,270
Kick him while he's down!

1664
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:57,730
Holy, how did I... Oh my gosh!

1665
01:52:58,470 --> 01:52:58,870
Oh shoot.

1666
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:00,130
Oh my god, that was so close.

1667
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,930
How did I survive that?

1668
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:12,560
Good!

1669
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:17,680
Nice.

1670
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:19,500
Checkpoint?

1671
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,380
Oh my god.

1672
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,460
Punch him, punch him.

1673
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:23,800
Punch him, punch him, punch.

1674
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,160
Punch him, punch him, punch, punch.

1675
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,600
Why is he acting so sussy like that?

1676
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,460
What's wrong with you?

1677
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,680
Oh, I can decide which way I want to go.

1678
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,720
Oh.

1679
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,120
No!

1680
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:47,700
Wait, is there something in every direction?

1681
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:07,740
What?

1682
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,240
Rescue...

1683
01:54:14,010 --> 01:54:15,950
We missed one.

1684
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:18,110
We missed one!

1685
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,470
Oh shucks.

1686
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:25,530
What did we miss?

1687
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,820
Where at?

1688
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,880
This way maybe?

1689
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:48,880
He only shoots in three ways.

1690
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:52,400
So I think I have to go back.

1691
01:54:58,570 --> 01:54:59,770
Or not.

1692
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:03,710
Or there is no way to go back.

1693
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:05,270
Over yonder?

1694
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:07,790
Where though?

1695
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:09,470
I never heard another guise.

1696
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:11,030
Wait a second.

1697
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:13,050
Oh I see it!

1698
01:55:14,110 --> 01:55:15,250
All the way!

1699
01:55:15,830 --> 01:55:17,130
I see it.

1700
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:19,850
Oh, there is a ladder.

1701
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:23,710
You guys see the glowing over there?

1702
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:29,150
Ah, I see it.

1703
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:34,710
I don't think it will be so hard to...

1704
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:36,650
Get back there actually.

1705
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:38,430
We can just take the bird.

1706
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:41,130
Take the bird...

1707
01:55:41,130 --> 01:55:41,790
Up to here.

1708
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,880
Oh, where is he taking me?

1709
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:49,160
No, bird!

1710
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,250
No, bird!

1711
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:02,830
You were supposed to take me over there!

1712
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,490
Bird!

1713
01:56:07,450 --> 01:56:08,350
Bird, no!

1714
01:56:09,970 --> 01:56:12,290
Now I do have to go through all of this again.

1715
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:13,570
Oh my god.

1716
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:15,810
Oh my god.

1717
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:18,190
We do have to go through all of this again.

1718
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,510
Oh, that was close.

1719
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:41,750
Oh, there is another bird.

1720
01:56:41,890 --> 01:56:43,030
I don't trust you bird.

1721
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,530
I don't trust you other bird.

1722
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:47,130
I don't trust you other bird.

1723
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:50,130
Oh, that was so close.

1724
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:51,210
Oh my gosh.

1725
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:52,610
I almost didn't ball.

1726
01:56:53,590 --> 01:56:55,410
We are balling, we are balling.

1727
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:57,910
Right here.

1728
01:56:59,270 --> 01:57:00,090
Let's take the ladder.

1729
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:04,330
Alright, which one is it?

1730
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,830
You!

1731
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:24,600
Oh gosh.

1732
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:26,240
Well, at least we got more money.

1733
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:28,820
That was so sneaky.

1734
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:32,660
Sneaky little bot.

1735
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,200
Okay.

1736
01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:41,320
Let's take the bird back.

1737
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:45,380
Let's take the bird back.

1738
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,300
To the golf course.

1739
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:50,700
It's probably easier.

1740
01:57:57,450 --> 01:58:00,630
Bird, now you are to prove of your use.

1741
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:06,150
Yes, I did not understand your usefulness before, but now I appreciate it.

1742
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:07,050
Thank you.

1743
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:13,830
And... Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1744
01:58:15,350 --> 01:58:16,450
And I'm in.

1745
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:19,950
Oh

1746
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:24,850
my goodness.

1747
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,180
Can you come down here?

1748
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:46,050
Nice.

1749
01:58:47,850 --> 01:58:48,230
There.

1750
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:50,110
Easy peasy.

1751
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:52,750
Lemon squeezy.

1752
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:57,910
I almost... I think I messed that up.

1753
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:02,970
A mystery.

1754
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:10,800
What the hell?

1755
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:25,310
Secret.

1756
01:59:25,310 --> 01:59:25,690
Secret.

1757
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:28,290
Secret.

1758
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:33,610
Pineapples!

1759
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:36,670
What are you doing with all those pineapples?

1760
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:38,470
And a person!

1761
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:39,610
Who is that?

1762
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:40,810
Secret.

1763
01:59:55,550 --> 01:59:57,290
What are you supposed to do here?

1764
01:59:58,810 --> 01:59:59,230
Pineapples!

1765
01:59:59,430 --> 02:00:01,090
Okay, we got rid of some pineapples.

1766
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:05,650
I'm just...

1767
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,730
Oh my gosh.

1768
02:00:09,730 --> 02:00:10,730
Is it Ada?

1769
02:00:11,410 --> 02:00:12,270
Ada Wong?

1770
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:13,450
I don't think so.

1771
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:16,450
I can't tell... Is it?

1772
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:18,030
I can't tell who that is.

1773
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,010
You shall see, if I ever get them down.

1774
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:22,710
Alright, come here.

1775
02:00:23,950 --> 02:00:24,770
There we go.

1776
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:26,030
Who is that?

1777
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:29,770
Wait, I recognize... Oh, I don't remember the...

1778
02:00:30,570 --> 02:00:33,590
I have a whopping 107 friends.

1779
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:34,630
Oh, what is this game?

1780
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:42,700
Suikoden!

1781
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:48,480
Oh my gosh, I really... I really messed up my throat earlier.

1782
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:51,840
This is what Raiden does to me.

1783
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,880
Raiden, you jerk!

1784
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:59,660
Raiden, you made me mess up my throat!

1785
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:01,700
I'm just gonna blame him.

1786
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:11,180
Raiden, you jerk, you...

1787
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,180
Big dummy jerk, Raiden.

1788
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:18,160
I think we got everything, but there's a warp here and I didn't see it.

1789
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:23,320
I didn't see a warp.

1790
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,400
Like a place to find a warp, even.

1791
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,720
Mysterious.

1792
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:32,720
What?

1793
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:33,840
Oh.

1794
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,240
Oh my god.

1795
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:38,520
Oh my goodness.

1796
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:41,640
I guess this is not the end.

1797
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:48,770
First try, let's go.

1798
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:51,810
We showered with riches!

1799
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:55,950
Nice.

1800
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:01,170
My reaction time for that was pretty good, I'm not gonna lie.

1801
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,970
Unless the warp is over there.

1802
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:07,530
Warp over there.

1803
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:09,870
Warp could be anywhere.

1804
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:14,750
We're overflowing with riches, oh my gosh.

1805
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:19,830
Riches beyond our wildest imagination.

1806
02:02:20,530 --> 02:02:22,370
Oh my gosh, you guys are so rich.

1807
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:24,490
We're rich in friendship.

1808
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,860
Hey warp, you around here?

1809
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:38,160
I can't tell, where am I?

1810
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,000
Oh my god.

1811
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,020
Oh wait.

1812
02:02:54,180 --> 02:02:55,660
This one.

1813
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:03,340
What's happening?

1814
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:04,000
Oh gosh.

1815
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:08,900
This one.

1816
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:11,500
Oh goodness.

1817
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,620
Oh this one.

1818
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:16,300
Oh.

1819
02:03:16,780 --> 02:03:17,860
We made it!

1820
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:20,500
Money.

1821
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,460
Money is our motivation.

1822
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:28,820
Is this the warp?

1823
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,240
Oh yeah it is.

1824
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:31,360
There we go.

1825
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,140
I did find it after all.

1826
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,300
Oh gosh, I'm gonna get a cough drop.

1827
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:40,940
Stupid Raiden.

1828
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:42,540
You jerk.

1829
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,260
I say as I'm the one who screamed.

1830
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,280
You guys, I'm almost done with my spider cookie.

1831
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:57,540
I still have all the other cookies still to eat.

1832
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:03,100
Motivation!

1833
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,520
Oh my god, thank you.

1834
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:09,140
Yeah, I've been slowly eating through the cookies.

1835
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:16,000
Secret.

1836
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,160
Nice.

1837
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,420
Rocket pull power.

1838
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:26,900
I guess we better dive on in.

1839
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:29,340
Wait, why did we not finish here?

1840
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:31,580
Oh we didn't get a puzzle piece.

1841
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,420
This one was a lot of fun.

1842
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:39,060
It's a secret.

1843
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:42,180
Let's try it.

1844
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:44,860
Hmm.

1845
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:48,260
Kinda sounds like they are saying made in man.

1846
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,760
They love me.

1847
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,200
What's this?

1848
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,180
We got a chicken!

1849
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:57,200
What's the chicken power again?

1850
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,640
That's the chicken power.

1851
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:09,760
Oh my god, it's so cute that you can knock all the snow off the trees though.

1852
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,320
Sorry birdies.

1853
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:13,300
Flowers.

1854
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:24,210
Little seals.

1855
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:28,230
Oh my gosh, this area is so beautiful it makes me want to go back to Antarctica.

1856
02:05:31,430 --> 02:05:32,110
Die.

1857
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:34,370
You especially die.

1858
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,880
Oh, did I kill him?

1859
02:05:55,390 --> 02:05:56,310
Oh gosh.

1860
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:00,270
Spooked me.

1861
02:06:01,630 --> 02:06:02,570
How was Antarctica?

1862
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:03,910
So amazing.

1863
02:06:04,750 --> 02:06:05,130
Oh, whoops.

1864
02:06:05,410 --> 02:06:06,150
I forgot to grab it.

1865
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:09,490
So awesome.

1866
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:12,810
Oh, I did it again.

1867
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:23,060
I love when these guys sound like they are saying kikiriki.

1868
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:28,540
Not sure if you get many northern lights in Antarctica.

1869
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:32,640
There's the southern lights, but...

1870
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,300
Wait, what's here?

1871
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:36,120
Wait, was there anything?

1872
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:39,760
I don't think so.

1873
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:46,060
There's the southern lights, which I really wanted to see.

1874
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:51,600
But, unfortunately, did not happen while we were there.

1875
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:56,180
Oh my gosh, the wolves!

1876
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:02,290
The sniper wolves are in my way!

1877
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:04,930
No swimming.

1878
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:06,470
What?

1879
02:07:16,570 --> 02:07:17,430
Who is this?

1880
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:20,810
Who is this?

1881
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:23,070
Magical graffitist.

1882
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:26,170
Their drawings really come to life.

1883
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:27,650
Oh no, your voice.

1884
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,350
I screamed way too much, oh gosh.

1885
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:31,530
I was so angry.

1886
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:34,030
I messed up, you guys.

1887
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:36,670
I did the one thing a streamer shouldn't do.

1888
02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:38,510
Get angry.

1889
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:42,270
Picture!

1890
02:07:43,150 --> 02:07:43,910
So cute.

1891
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:48,010
Beautiful.

1892
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,700
I'll be better tomorrow.

1893
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:58,620
What's in here?

1894
02:07:58,860 --> 02:07:59,280
Oh goodness.

1895
02:08:09,050 --> 02:08:09,510
Nice.

1896
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:15,410
Okay, no swimming.

1897
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:17,030
Okay.

1898
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:19,330
Oops.

1899
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:38,560
Is the puzzle piece still here or did I already get it?

1900
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:40,600
Oh, it counts for lots of coins.

1901
02:08:41,580 --> 02:08:42,360
So that's good.

1902
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:45,660
One of the squirrels fell in.

1903
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,640
There we go.

1904
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:56,180
Alright.

1905
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:59,560
Let's make sure I'm not missing anything.

1906
02:08:59,560 --> 02:08:59,800
Missing...

1907
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:03,660
Oh my god, I almost said missing.

1908
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,340
Missing anything over the sides as well.

1909
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:09,080
Since there's two puzzle pieces we gotta be on the lookout for.

1910
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:12,920
How do I do this one?

1911
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:27,390
Gosh.

1912
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:40,830
Give me all the money.

1913
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:43,710
Give me all the money.

1914
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,160
I think we're good.

1915
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:51,200
There

1916
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:54,720
we go.

1917
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:55,300
Nice.

1918
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,640
Just don't get frozen.

1919
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:02,700
Yeah, pretty much.

1920
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:05,900
Can I put my head on the cutout?

1921
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:10,440
Oh, cute!

1922
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,360
Let's see if I can...

1923
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,060
Oh no, wait.

1924
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,700
My mask is too big.

1925
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:40,240
I can be in front of the cutout, but it doesn't have the same effect, I think.

1926
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,060
Doesn't really have the...

1927
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,500
Doesn't really have the same effect, I think.

1928
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,240
Okay.

1929
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:00,800
So cold.

1930
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:04,820
Oh my goodness!

1931
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:06,320
Nice.

1932
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:08,880
Evil.

1933
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:15,180
Nice.

1934
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:17,280
Oh goodness.

1935
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:20,680
We were too cold, now we're too hot.

1936
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:23,060
What do you want from me, little guy?

1937
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:33,770
Oh my god.

1938
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:45,920
Nasty.

1939
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:52,380
Nothing over the side it seems.

1940
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:07,770
What the hell is that thing?

1941
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:10,810
I think it's a crab.

1942
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:14,470
Give me the money.

1943
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:17,010
Oh shoot, not this guy.

1944
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:19,970
Come here, come here.

1945
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:29,960
Mint went to hell.

1946
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:33,200
Oh gosh, oh my gosh.

1947
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:41,340
Oh my god.

1948
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:46,960
Oopsie.

1949
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,600
Woo!

1950
02:12:58,210 --> 02:12:58,850
Nice.

1951
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:02,610
Okay.

1952
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:05,210
Now once we...

1953
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:12,270
Perfect.

1954
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:16,030
Good job, us.

1955
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:18,210
Made pancake.

1956
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:21,230
What are you trying to say, huh?

1957
02:13:26,070 --> 02:13:26,710
Pancake?

1958
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:29,290
Is that what we're calling me now, huh?

1959
02:13:43,390 --> 02:13:44,310
Oh my gosh.

1960
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:45,690
Oh my god.

1961
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:46,670
Evil.

1962
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:54,340
I tried to get the... We have to get him.

1963
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:02,900
We have to get him this way.

1964
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:05,440
We have to bait him this way.

1965
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:06,600
Oh my god.

1966
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:07,980
Ah, shoot.

1967
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:13,590
Still worked, baby.

1968
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,810
Still worked, baby.

1969
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:17,910
Yeah!

1970
02:14:20,030 --> 02:14:20,750
Nice.

1971
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:24,230
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1972
02:14:25,670 --> 02:14:28,690
I can't believe how many levels are in this game, honestly.

1973
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:31,310
Oh, he's dead.

1974
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:33,310
Nevermind.

1975
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:35,550
He's alive, unfortunately.

1976
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:36,910
Oh, I'm dead.

1977
02:14:37,370 --> 02:14:38,050
Unfortunately.

1978
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:41,650
I'm the dead one.

1979
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:43,450
Oh man.

1980
02:14:49,490 --> 02:14:50,210
Easy.

1981
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:52,450
See?

1982
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:53,790
See, easy?

1983
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:54,750
Easy.

1984
02:14:55,670 --> 02:14:56,970
You were always the dead one.

1985
02:14:57,230 --> 02:14:57,670
True.

1986
02:14:58,130 --> 02:14:58,870
So true.

1987
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:08,970
We need this guy.

1988
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:14,730
Oh, shoot.

1989
02:15:15,010 --> 02:15:18,410
I don't think that worked.

1990
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:20,970
I don't think that worked.

1991
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:22,010
Oh, grab it!

1992
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:23,210
Yeah!

1993
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:29,820
Goodness.

1994
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:34,260
Alright, get away from my...

1995
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:39,780
Sometimes this game can drive a ghost mad.

1996
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:41,600
Oh, I hear you.

1997
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:42,900
Who are you?

1998
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:46,300
Get him in the butt.

1999
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:48,440
Who is that?

2000
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:50,640
Wormhole survivor.

2001
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,600
3 billion years from home.

2002
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:53,440
Who is this?

2003
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:55,220
I died.

2004
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:58,860
Today I discovered...

2005
02:15:58,860 --> 02:15:59,520
It's a pancake.

2006
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:01,640
I love pancakes.

2007
02:16:01,740 --> 02:16:02,140
They're delicious.

2008
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:05,760
I prefer...

2009
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,920
I prefer...

2010
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:08,900
No, waffles.

2011
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:11,660
Oh, he's just a PSVR guy?

2012
02:16:17,410 --> 02:16:18,530
Oh, fun.

2013
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:22,670
How do I get to this underneath though?

2014
02:16:24,210 --> 02:16:25,570
And I hear another guy.

2015
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:28,190
He's like...

2016
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,350
You hear that?

2017
02:16:31,830 --> 02:16:32,770
Where is he?

2018
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:34,870
It's not us, is it?

2019
02:16:37,670 --> 02:16:38,950
How do I get in here?

2020
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:47,250
How do I get in here?

2021
02:16:55,710 --> 02:16:56,670
Laser feet?

2022
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:59,250
Oh, if I...

2023
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:01,670
I see.

2024
02:17:01,950 --> 02:17:02,770
Just from the inside.

2025
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:04,570
You're so smart.

2026
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:11,660
I didn't know you were smart.

2027
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:12,720
Oh gosh.

2028
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:17,640
I didn't know you were so smart.

2029
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:22,100
Wait, how do I kill this guy again?

2030
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,880
I think I might have to bird...

2031
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:26,500
I might have to chicken over on top of him.

2032
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:27,440
Oh my gosh.

2033
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:32,920
I want to kill him before we go back to get all the stuff over here, you know?

2034
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:40,170
I keep forgetting to bird.

2035
02:17:40,470 --> 02:17:40,850
Good morning.

2036
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:42,030
This game is cute.

2037
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:43,890
It's cute.

2038
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:51,190
Don't touch the magma.

2039
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:00,040
It won't let me back up.

2040
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:01,640
Oh wait, this is how I went up.

2041
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:03,920
This is how I went up.

2042
02:18:08,960 --> 02:18:09,420
Oh god.

2043
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,980
Was it worth it for three coins?

2044
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:13,700
I don't know, but...

2045
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:19,360
Oh my gosh.

2046
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:21,980
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2047
02:18:24,980 --> 02:18:25,700
Holy moly.

2048
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:37,640
We still got his ass.

2049
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:41,740
Yeah!

2050
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,960
We still got his butt.

2051
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:47,640
S1!

2052
02:18:48,020 --> 02:18:49,180
Thank you for the 20 gilded!

2053
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,500
Thank you!

2054
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:55,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2055
02:18:58,220 --> 02:18:58,740
Alright.

2056
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:00,720
Is that the last guy down there?

2057
02:19:15,390 --> 02:19:16,430
Oh shoot.

2058
02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:17,250
Oh shoot.

2059
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:23,840
Let's try again.

2060
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,280
Dang it.

2061
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:30,340
I almost had it.

2062
02:19:34,830 --> 02:19:35,310
Oh.

2063
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:35,990
Uh oh.

2064
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:37,510
No, not this shit again.

2065
02:19:37,710 --> 02:19:38,230
Are you serious?

2066
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:40,690
No way.

2067
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:43,710
Seriously?

2068
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:45,130
Oh my god.

2069
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:46,590
How am I gonna get out of here though?

2070
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:49,750
Holy...

2071
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:50,590
Oh my god.

2072
02:20:03,390 --> 02:20:05,710
We were so close!

2073
02:20:05,710 --> 02:20:07,250
So close!

2074
02:20:11,010 --> 02:20:11,990
I'm a genius.

2075
02:20:15,050 --> 02:20:16,610
I might be a genius.

2076
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,220
Oh my god.

2077
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:27,040
Well, I said that, but...

2078
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:27,500
Oh my god.

2079
02:20:38,460 --> 02:20:39,580
Living relic.

2080
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:41,520
What did I get?

2081
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:43,160
They'll leave you in pieces.

2082
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:44,060
What is that?

2083
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:45,920
What is that thing?

2084
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,700
Here comes the money!

2085
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:51,480
Give it a decade!

2086
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:55,280
Knack.

2087
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:56,340
Who's Knack?

2088
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:06,580
Clear baby, clear.

2089
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:15,260
Okay, hold on.

2090
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:22,980
We can do eight more gotchas.

2091
02:21:24,440 --> 02:21:25,660
It's a chicken guy.

2092
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:31,840
Okay, nice.

2093
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:36,200
We're killing it, you guys.

2094
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:36,920
We're killing it.

2095
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,980
We haven't done a single...

2096
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,500
Oh no, that's a lie.

2097
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:47,200
We've done one world from the new universe.

2098
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:49,980
I was gonna say, it's been two and a half hours...

2099
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:53,380
We haven't done really anything.

2100
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,960
Oh my gosh, they're flossing.

2101
02:21:58,200 --> 02:21:58,800
Oh boy.

2102
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:02,280
Oh, we get whatever this elephant is.

2103
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:05,960
All the animals flock to us.

2104
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,760
Animal attraction.

2105
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:10,820
The safari park is open.

2106
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,380
That is a wild achievement.

2107
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:18,280
Oh, this one is huge.

2108
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,780
Okay, what's in here?

2109
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:24,080
Safari.

2110
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:26,320
Safari park!

2111
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,340
Is this like a Pokemon?

2112
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:33,080
It's bigger on the inside.

2113
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:35,260
Cheese!

2114
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:36,420
Cheese!

2115
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:42,450
Emotes?

2116
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:46,770
I can't...

2117
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:51,950
Oh...

2118
02:22:57,700 --> 02:22:58,420
Okay.

2119
02:23:01,220 --> 02:23:02,840
Is there money in here?

2120
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:05,100
That's all I care about.

2121
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:08,720
I'll take that.

2122
02:23:09,360 --> 02:23:09,960
What's this?

2123
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:11,320
I got...

2124
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:14,580
Oh my god!

2125
02:23:16,660 --> 02:23:17,920
Knack is back, baby!

2126
02:23:18,620 --> 02:23:20,000
It's the little dog!

2127
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:21,500
Who's a good boy?

2128
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:25,740
Can I take a photo anywhere?

2129
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:26,660
Oh, I can.

2130
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,580
That's fun.

2131
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:30,640
But this says it's a designated photo spot.

2132
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:34,880
Okay, everybody say cheese!

2133
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:36,460
Hold on.

2134
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,560
My hand is really shaky.

2135
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:40,040
Can I zoom in?

2136
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:40,620
Oh, here we go.

2137
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:44,680
Cheese!

2138
02:23:48,620 --> 02:23:50,000
Strike a pose!

2139
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:53,180
You get money for the photos?

2140
02:23:58,990 --> 02:24:00,890
Why I don't get any money here?

2141
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:03,670
Oh my god!

2142
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:06,610
Where's my money?

2143
02:24:09,070 --> 02:24:11,090
What the hell?

2144
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:14,210
This is so silly.

2145
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:17,890
Where

2146
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:25,680
are we going?

2147
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:28,620
What's this?

2148
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:29,820
We got...

2149
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:31,260
Another dog!

2150
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:33,980
A paw pose!

2151
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:39,540
This area is huge.

2152
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:42,880
My goodness.

2153
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,900
Another photo spot there.

2154
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:52,920
More money up here.

2155
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:55,380
Let's go.

2156
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:58,400
I didn't know they were known for...

2157
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:59,780
The capybara!

2158
02:24:59,780 --> 02:25:01,440
Not the capybara.

2159
02:25:01,540 --> 02:25:03,500
I didn't know they made those little pups.

2160
02:25:04,960 --> 02:25:05,960
The Sony pups?

2161
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:07,560
Oh my gosh, too cute.

2162
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:09,460
Hold on.

2163
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:11,500
Oh my gosh, so cute!

2164
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:15,160
How do I emote?

2165
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,980
Oh, it's my face!

2166
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:21,200
I'm in love with the monkey.

2167
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:28,270
Cute, so cute.

2168
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:30,570
Where is it?

2169
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:33,150
Oh, that's not an egg.

2170
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:35,630
What's up here?

2171
02:25:37,490 --> 02:25:38,010
Snail.

2172
02:25:50,180 --> 02:25:51,700
What's the point of going up here?

2173
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:53,840
I don't know.

2174
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:58,620
Return to monkey.

2175
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:01,500
How do I swim again?

2176
02:26:03,220 --> 02:26:04,140
Oh, there we go.

2177
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:04,940
Woah.

2178
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:10,900
Where is the money?

2179
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:14,060
Where is the money?

2180
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:15,820
Any money in here?

2181
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:17,020
I'm greedy.

2182
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:18,480
Give me the money!

2183
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,400
Ok, nevermind.

2184
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,260
Let's go do some gacha.

2185
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:28,240
Money on the tree?

2186
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:28,680
That one?

2187
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:29,760
I don't know how to get out there.

2188
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,440
It's ok.

2189
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:33,120
I had fun in here.

2190
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,060
Safari zone is so fun.

2191
02:26:39,380 --> 02:26:41,600
We are trying for snake outfits.

2192
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:46,160
Let me...

2193
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:50,040
Snake outfits, let's go!

2194
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:53,400
What is that?

2195
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:55,480
Doomed ride.

2196
02:26:55,780 --> 02:26:58,460
Oh, it's the Uncharted truck.

2197
02:26:59,960 --> 02:27:00,700
Wait.

2198
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:04,760
This is not a skin.

2199
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:06,780
Or this is not clothes.

2200
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,530
This is for...

2201
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:09,100
Oh, lion.

2202
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:12,320
Skin?

2203
02:27:14,940 --> 02:27:15,980
Oh, stop.

2204
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:16,860
It's so cute.

2205
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,880
It's a red panda.

2206
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:21,720
I'll take it.

2207
02:27:21,780 --> 02:27:22,320
What's this one?

2208
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,040
Couch TV game thing.

2209
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:28,040
Duel Raider.

2210
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:33,960
Another skin for our controller.

2211
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:36,920
We can do four more.

2212
02:27:38,060 --> 02:27:39,740
Handy cannon.

2213
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:41,320
Cute.

2214
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:47,220
And...

2215
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:48,400
Ineffective jail.

2216
02:27:50,180 --> 02:27:52,460
A reminder of Drake's misfortune.

2217
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:55,460
One more...

2218
02:28:00,330 --> 02:28:01,390
Forty-five's boar?

2219
02:28:02,150 --> 02:28:02,830
Oh

2220
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:09,100
my gosh!

2221
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:12,600
It's the... Oh my gosh, this really is the PSVR.

2222
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:17,560
That's it.

2223
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:23,140
Time to be a five's boar.

2224
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:24,920
Forty-five's boar.

2225
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:27,220
Try not... Scariest stories.

2226
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:28,880
Try not to get scared.

2227
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:33,000
Forty-five's boar.

2228
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:34,640
Let's become him.

2229
02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:35,460
Got it.

2230
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:36,100
Give me money.

2231
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:36,480
No!

2232
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:41,380
I don't even know if there is a snake outfit, but I hope there is.

2233
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:43,980
Forty-five's boar.

2234
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:46,260
Oh my gosh, we're too cute actually!

2235
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:48,300
Wait, what's the red panda though?

2236
02:28:52,750 --> 02:28:54,510
Oh my gosh, stop!

2237
02:28:56,490 --> 02:28:58,170
We gotta be forty-five's boar though.

2238
02:29:02,790 --> 02:29:03,310
Hoar!

2239
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:03,850
Hoar!

2240
02:29:03,990 --> 02:29:04,230
Hoar!

2241
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:05,130
Hoar!

2242
02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:05,690
Hoar!

2243
02:29:05,810 --> 02:29:06,010
Hoar!

2244
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:06,370
Hoar!

2245
02:29:06,790 --> 02:29:07,310
Hoar!

2246
02:29:07,530 --> 02:29:07,630
Hoar!

2247
02:29:07,870 --> 02:29:08,390
Hoar!

2248
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:08,890
Hoar!

2249
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:10,090
Hoar!

2250
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:10,970
Hoar!

2251
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:14,070
Oh you got your thing!

2252
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:21,530
The blowing the flowers is really cute.

2253
02:29:22,810 --> 02:29:24,030
Oops, sorry my button.

2254
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:25,570
What else we got?

2255
02:29:27,610 --> 02:29:28,230
Turn

2256
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:40,120
the things!

2257
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:42,160
I understand now!

2258
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,140
I understand now!

2259
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:48,460
I get it!

2260
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:49,380
I get it!

2261
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:51,560
Oh my gosh!

2262
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:53,320
I get it now!

2263
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:59,320
You're not gonna get any stylish points like that!

2264
02:29:59,620 --> 02:30:00,380
Yeah, yeah, come on!

2265
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:04,860
Oh my gosh, everything here.

2266
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:10,700
Sorry mister.

2267
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:13,440
The kid turned into a dog.

2268
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:15,220
He's got that dog in him.

2269
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,800
He's smacking his meat.

2270
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:23,340
He's beating his meat.

2271
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:25,200
The bird.

2272
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:28,180
What does this guy do?

2273
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,400
Oh goodness gracious!

2274
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:43,880
Which game is this one?

2275
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:52,380
It reminds me of... I know it's not, but it reminds me of Knight.

2276
02:30:55,180 --> 02:30:56,320
Devil Dice.

2277
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:03,060
Devil Dice.

2278
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:05,280
Hello Mint!

2279
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:07,260
Hello, hello, hello!

2280
02:31:07,860 --> 02:31:11,700
Let's go back to the chameleon world.

2281
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:15,520
Nice!

2282
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:15,640
Nice!

2283
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:19,500
Oh my gosh, I can't believe we golded that one.

2284
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,680
What should we do?

2285
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,560
Oh gosh, it's probably all underwater.

2286
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:25,580
Let's go to the balloon... It sounds like a breeze.

2287
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:28,760
Balloon breeze, my kind of place.

2288
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:35,370
Until like 10 people on this chat knows Knight.

2289
02:31:35,690 --> 02:31:37,710
Well, I do too, okay?

2290
02:31:38,510 --> 02:31:40,030
If you know, you know.

2291
02:31:41,370 --> 02:31:42,210
Little beetle.

2292
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:45,150
Oh that's right, I gotta beat these guys up.

2293
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:49,940
Good job.

2294
02:31:51,880 --> 02:31:52,300
Elliebot!

2295
02:31:54,860 --> 02:31:57,220
Welcome to membership, thank you!

2296
02:31:58,140 --> 02:31:59,400
Wait, was there anything else down here?

2297
02:32:03,440 --> 02:32:04,800
Hey, hey, hey, you, you, you.

2298
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:06,940
Hey, hey, you, you.

2299
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:09,060
I need to go on your tummy.

2300
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:11,900
There's a puzzle, there's a puzzle.

2301
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:13,380
Over there's a puzzle, please.

2302
02:32:16,460 --> 02:32:16,880
Nice.

2303
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:17,620
Oh my god.

2304
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:20,060
Looks so delicious, this guy.

2305
02:32:26,230 --> 02:32:27,030
Nice.

2306
02:32:29,770 --> 02:32:32,290
Everything is alive in this game.

2307
02:32:32,350 --> 02:32:33,070
It's kind of crazy.

2308
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:39,520
There's a guy!

2309
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:41,420
Help me!

2310
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:43,300
Help me!

2311
02:32:46,450 --> 02:32:47,550
I got him.

2312
02:32:48,930 --> 02:32:50,130
Imagine being a shovel.

2313
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:52,370
What's wrong?

2314
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:52,490
What's wrong?

2315
02:32:53,150 --> 02:32:54,310
We have to have...

2316
02:32:54,310 --> 02:32:57,030
We have to have jobs for everything.

2317
02:32:58,250 --> 02:32:58,950
You know?

2318
02:32:59,530 --> 02:33:02,670
There's gotta be some people who are the...

2319
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:04,630
Our friend!

2320
02:33:05,870 --> 02:33:11,370
Some guys who are the giants that are awesome and some guys who are the...

2321
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:13,510
The shovels.

2322
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:18,710
Hold on a second, I'm starting to get a little bit hungry, so I'm gonna finish my sandwich here.

2323
02:33:19,670 --> 02:33:20,930
How are you guys doing this weekend?

2324
02:33:26,620 --> 02:33:27,860
My big brother.

2325
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:29,820
I've always wanted a big brother.

2326
02:33:41,950 --> 02:33:43,110
Good and lazy.

2327
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:45,150
Lazy is good on the weekend.

2328
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:09,120
Got scared that today is Sunday?

2329
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:12,240
I'm actually going out with some friends tomorrow.

2330
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:13,200
I know.

2331
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:15,280
Minto?

2332
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:17,120
Leaving the maid cafe?

2333
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:22,480
I'm going out with some friends tomorrow, which is why I have a really early stream.

2334
02:34:28,210 --> 02:34:29,370
I'm touching grass.

2335
02:34:29,610 --> 02:34:30,430
I'm touching grass.

2336
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:36,280
I'm going outside.

2337
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:41,880
It's gonna be crazy, but I'm really excited.

2338
02:34:54,690 --> 02:34:58,850
I'm kind of nervous about the web fishing though, because all I see from people is...

2339
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:02,910
Is that their games keep getting hacked or something.

2340
02:35:04,010 --> 02:35:07,450
So I'm like, is that gonna happen to me?

2341
02:35:17,710 --> 02:35:18,870
But how do I get you?

2342
02:35:23,580 --> 02:35:26,280
Oh my gosh, this is kind of annoying.

2343
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:29,500
How do I get your eyes?

2344
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:32,540
Leave me alone!

2345
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:33,280
I

2346
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:39,040
can't attack while I'm in the air.

2347
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:49,700
How am I supposed to...

2348
02:35:49,700 --> 02:35:50,420
Hold on.

2349
02:35:51,260 --> 02:35:53,480
I've heard some VTubers complaining about getting hacked.

2350
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:56,080
There we go.

2351
02:35:56,980 --> 02:35:58,660
I think I was overthinking it.

2352
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:03,040
Yeah, so I'm a little nervous about like...

2353
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,880
About it, but hopefully it's okay.

2354
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:08,040
Oh my god, he's...

2355
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:10,020
Brother.

2356
02:36:10,780 --> 02:36:12,340
I've always wanted a brother.

2357
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,060
It's kind of freaking me out.

2358
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:21,500
Okay, see you later brother.

2359
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:23,900
Oh, what the hell?

2360
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:28,320
I gotta inflate this thing.

2361
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:31,360
Oh no!

2362
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:33,100
Oh, it's... Okay.

2363
02:36:34,980 --> 02:36:37,540
Wait, how do I... Oh my god, please.

2364
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:47,840
There we go.

2365
02:36:53,830 --> 02:36:55,430
And an Upsidaisy.

2366
02:36:55,430 --> 02:36:56,690
Oh, what is that?

2367
02:36:57,410 --> 02:36:58,890
Oh my god!

2368
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:08,310
We're just inflating everybody.

2369
02:37:08,930 --> 02:37:10,650
What the hell?

2370
02:37:13,490 --> 02:37:14,150
Rainbow.

2371
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:17,410
Rainbow!

2372
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:19,570
Oh, money.

2373
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:22,370
It pays.

2374
02:37:23,230 --> 02:37:23,890
Deploy.

2375
02:37:36,350 --> 02:37:37,190
There we go.

2376
02:37:39,750 --> 02:37:41,630
What flew out?

2377
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:46,020
Oh, what is that?

2378
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:55,560
What is it?

2379
02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:01,840
Oh, it gives me more air.

2380
02:38:03,660 --> 02:38:05,680
Wow, interesting.

2381
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:05,840
Interesting.

2382
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:16,060
Oh gosh, there's even more of them.

2383
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,440
Let's wait until he shoots again.

2384
02:38:24,700 --> 02:38:25,360
Ice him.

2385
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:28,640
Easy game, easy game.

2386
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:36,180
Oh my gosh!

2387
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:38,380
I can even destroy those!

2388
02:38:38,380 --> 02:38:39,800
That's crazy.

2389
02:38:39,900 --> 02:38:47,640
Oh my gosh.

2390
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,960
The detail.

2391
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:52,160
That's crazy!

2392
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:54,940
What the...

2393
02:39:00,740 --> 02:39:02,140
Oh, brother.

2394
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:04,980
Brother.

2395
02:39:05,240 --> 02:39:06,660
Oh my gosh, succulents.

2396
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:08,580
Oh my goodness.

2397
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:11,780
Oh, hello.

2398
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:26,440
I'm not very happy to see you because...

2399
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:28,460
We can't even go back!

2400
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:31,980
We missed somebody.

2401
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:36,460
We missed somebody and we can't go back.

2402
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:38,420
And it was an important person.

2403
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:39,220
It was a VIP.

2404
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:46,120
Oh, that sucks.

2405
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:55,360
That sucks.

2406
02:40:03,020 --> 02:40:03,850
I see you.

2407
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:05,890
I see you drowning in there.

2408
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:08,590
I got you!

2409
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:15,540
What?

2410
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:16,820
Wait, what?

2411
02:40:35,800 --> 02:40:38,040
I'm gonna lose my brain cells.

2412
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:40,980
I'm gonna lose my...

2413
02:40:41,740 --> 02:40:42,380
What?

2414
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,600
Is he in here?

2415
02:40:48,260 --> 02:40:50,040
What is going on here?

2416
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:53,120
He is refusing your advances.

2417
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:54,420
What is happening?

2418
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:56,140
Are they like flirting?

2419
02:40:57,100 --> 02:40:58,800
What is going...

2420
02:41:02,380 --> 02:41:03,900
Oh my goodness.

2421
02:41:10,360 --> 02:41:12,080
Where did I miss?

2422
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:15,280
You guys, I'm actually legitimately so confused.

2423
02:41:15,380 --> 02:41:16,640
Unless it's like somewhere in here.

2424
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:20,720
You think like beneath the rocks there's a...

2425
02:41:23,420 --> 02:41:24,620
There's a...

2426
02:41:24,620 --> 02:41:26,000
Maybe a...

2427
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,200
A stringpole?

2428
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:29,980
I don't see one.

2429
02:41:32,680 --> 02:41:34,420
It's hidden in the beans.

2430
02:41:39,150 --> 02:41:40,430
In the beans.

2431
02:41:40,570 --> 02:41:42,010
Maybe over by the cacti.

2432
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:49,600
I don't know.

2433
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:52,200
I hear a shimmering.

2434
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:55,720
I don't know what that is though.

2435
02:41:58,250 --> 02:42:00,480
Oh, it's coming from...

2436
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:02,520
Oh, it's these guys.

2437
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:04,720
Every time I get close they like open up.

2438
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:05,560
See?

2439
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:08,020
They open up.

2440
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:08,960
I don't know why.

2441
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:10,280
They are very friendly.

2442
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:12,440
That's what the shimmering is.

2443
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:17,160
But where is the guy if he is even in here?

2444
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:23,100
Actually,

2445
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:38,980
I think that's the way we need to go.

2446
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:43,620
I think this is just for extra somethings or other.

2447
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:53,040
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna get dead.

2448
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:53,660
I'm gonna die!

2449
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:54,400
Oh my gosh.

2450
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:55,820
That was close.

2451
02:42:58,040 --> 02:42:59,300
Oh, I see one in there.

2452
02:43:01,020 --> 02:43:02,220
Stop harassing her!

2453
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:04,100
Who are you?

2454
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:07,120
Who is this?

2455
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:09,100
Young holiday maker.

2456
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:10,360
Still remembers the summer of...

2457
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:11,020
Oh, it's that!

2458
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:12,900
Isn't that Natsu something?

2459
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:15,020
My summer?

2460
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:21,200
My summer vacation.

2461
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:26,180
I remember watching the Tim Rogers...

2462
02:43:26,180 --> 02:43:26,780
Actually, wait.

2463
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:29,880
I think I remember seeing the Tim Rogers video.

2464
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:31,220
Maybe I didn't watch it though.

2465
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:36,400
Hidden money.

2466
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:47,260
I remember seeing his video about it, but I didn't watch it yet.

2467
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:54,640
You have to really make time for those sorts of events, right?

2468
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:02,800
OK.

2469
02:44:03,760 --> 02:44:04,900
We got this.

2470
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:05,900
Probably.

2471
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:08,240
Oh, I just realized we have like a little...

2472
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:11,280
Oh my goodness.

2473
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:12,440
They spit at me!

2474
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:13,760
Disgusting.

2475
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:15,680
Oh, this guy is spitting at me.

2476
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:16,560
Nevermind.

2477
02:44:17,140 --> 02:44:18,600
Hey, chill out.

2478
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:23,320
How do I get out of this?

2479
02:44:23,720 --> 02:44:24,520
There we go.

2480
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:25,820
Easy.

2481
02:44:28,380 --> 02:44:29,600
I hear somebody.

2482
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:36,210
I can't believe we missed one!

2483
02:44:36,810 --> 02:44:37,870
I can't believe it!

2484
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:41,270
I can't believe we missed one!

2485
02:44:45,870 --> 02:44:47,310
So sad.

2486
02:44:47,970 --> 02:44:48,930
So stupid.

2487
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:51,890
Oh my gosh.

2488
02:45:01,570 --> 02:45:02,090
Dandelion.

2489
02:45:02,150 --> 02:45:02,990
Oh, I gotta breathe.

2490
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:14,120
Rain, rain, go away!

2491
02:45:15,820 --> 02:45:16,580
Oh my goodness.

2492
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,060
Alright.

2493
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:23,600
There's one more guy we gotta get.

2494
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:25,800
At least.

2495
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,640
If it was just a normal guy, that'd be one thing.

2496
02:45:31,280 --> 02:45:33,060
But it's a dang...

2497
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:36,820
It's a dang special guy.

2498
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:37,700
Special character.

2499
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:42,860
Chill out, guy.

2500
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:55,000
I should've...

2501
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:58,360
I should've been more careful.

2502
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:03,240
There's no guys here, right?

2503
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:06,800
I think I should land on that little flower.

2504
02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:08,360
I mean that little petal.

2505
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:10,600
Nah, I'll grow a knife.

2506
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:15,340
No, no, no, no!

2507
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:18,700
I'm gonna die.

2508
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:19,920
Everybody...

2509
02:46:19,920 --> 02:46:20,320
Goodbye!

2510
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:31,780
Okay, I got greedy.

2511
02:46:32,660 --> 02:46:33,400
And I died.

2512
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:39,480
Nice.

2513
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:42,940
Attack.

2514
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:46,240
And this one over here.

2515
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:53,260
Please, please come back!

2516
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:54,040
Come to me!

2517
02:47:02,210 --> 02:47:02,770
Gosh.

2518
02:47:04,930 --> 02:47:08,490
The more I think I get better at this game, the more I realize I've regressed.

2519
02:47:09,030 --> 02:47:10,530
This one is kinda tricky though.

2520
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:14,690
I'd say it's the most difficult...

2521
02:47:18,170 --> 02:47:20,950
Because once you start blowing out...

2522
02:47:20,950 --> 02:47:23,950
Once you start blowing out, you have to commit to the blowout.

2523
02:47:26,960 --> 02:47:28,490
It's not like a...

2524
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:30,550
Oh, I'll just re-inflate.

2525
02:47:31,970 --> 02:47:33,650
You gotta... You blow out.

2526
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:42,630
Alright.

2527
02:47:43,270 --> 02:47:46,110
If I just miss... If I miss...

2528
02:47:46,110 --> 02:47:49,310
I'm just gonna have to go with it, I think.

2529
02:47:51,790 --> 02:47:52,430
Okay.

2530
02:47:52,890 --> 02:47:53,830
We can go to the top.

2531
02:47:54,950 --> 02:47:56,750
Okay, we can do that.

2532
02:47:57,390 --> 02:47:58,690
Stop blowing at me!

2533
02:48:00,410 --> 02:48:00,770
Okay.

2534
02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:02,650
It's this one over here.

2535
02:48:06,210 --> 02:48:07,730
Oh my gosh, that was close.

2536
02:48:09,530 --> 02:48:10,170
Nice!

2537
02:48:11,190 --> 02:48:12,550
He's blowing me!

2538
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:14,510
Ow!

2539
02:48:18,450 --> 02:48:20,230
Oh my gosh, I almost died.

2540
02:48:21,570 --> 02:48:23,390
Love my greedy Yoshi ghost.

2541
02:48:26,210 --> 02:48:26,770
Okay.

2542
02:48:27,930 --> 02:48:29,290
We have to get to the whale.

2543
02:48:32,070 --> 02:48:33,690
I can use the green box again.

2544
02:48:33,930 --> 02:48:34,490
Vendor!

2545
02:48:34,770 --> 02:48:36,290
Thank you for 6 months.

2546
02:48:41,610 --> 02:48:42,450
Oh my gosh.

2547
02:48:43,410 --> 02:48:44,450
I saw those guys.

2548
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:45,670
Okay.

2549
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:52,370
This thing needs more air in it.

2550
02:48:53,190 --> 02:48:54,190
It's not very taut.

2551
02:48:57,360 --> 02:48:57,820
Hey!

2552
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:00,260
We got all three.

2553
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:02,120
Missed the puzzle piece?

2554
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:03,240
No I didn't.

2555
02:49:04,340 --> 02:49:06,120
No I didn't.

2556
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:11,260
Oh shoot.

2557
02:49:11,980 --> 02:49:12,960
Oh please!

2558
02:49:13,240 --> 02:49:13,580
Please!

2559
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:16,480
What the...

2560
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:17,520
What got me?

2561
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:20,620
I think it was the...

2562
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:22,520
Look at how cute they are, little bumblebees.

2563
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:31,340
They're cute as little bumblebees though.

2564
02:49:33,180 --> 02:49:35,580
Alright, we still have one guy...

2565
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:37,720
that we can still get.

2566
02:49:40,420 --> 02:49:42,720
Oh, that's a lot of money.

2567
02:49:48,380 --> 02:49:50,820
I got greedy.

2568
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:54,480
I once again...

2569
02:49:55,420 --> 02:49:57,060
have been greedy.

2570
02:49:58,780 --> 02:49:59,400
Really cute.

2571
02:49:59,620 --> 02:50:00,680
Thank you.

2572
02:50:01,300 --> 02:50:01,860
Wait a second.

2573
02:50:02,840 --> 02:50:04,680
Ayami Mama's art is cute.

2574
02:50:05,860 --> 02:50:06,620
Okay, money.

2575
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:08,680
Money.

2576
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:11,760
Oh man, missed the money.

2577
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:13,240
It's okay.

2578
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:14,220
Oh my gosh.

2579
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:18,520
Wait, there's a guy over there!

2580
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:22,200
I

2581
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:36,540
didn't go for the money, I'm just...

2582
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:37,760
You know.

2583
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:40,860
Hot dog.

2584
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:43,820
Yeah, hot dog.

2585
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:49,560
Oh gosh.

2586
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:55,280
I can't see.

2587
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:56,900
Am I in the right spot?

2588
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:01,100
That was close.

2589
02:51:01,380 --> 02:51:02,760
That was really close.

2590
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:04,200
Okay.

2591
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:05,560
Nice.

2592
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:09,740
I think...I don't know if I can...

2593
02:51:09,740 --> 02:51:11,440
Oh I can, I think.

2594
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:12,200
Oh shoot.

2595
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:14,200
Please!

2596
02:51:14,480 --> 02:51:14,740
Please!

2597
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:15,100
Please!

2598
02:51:23,300 --> 02:51:26,820
Alright, so we've gotten all the guys at least.

2599
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,040
There's still a warp?

2600
02:51:28,900 --> 02:51:32,640
I wonder if it's anywhere around these edges.

2601
02:51:47,870 --> 02:51:48,850
Alright, underplayed.

2602
02:51:48,870 --> 02:51:49,450
Thanks for the hat.

2603
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:50,350
Oh my brother.

2604
02:51:51,330 --> 02:51:52,490
Thanks for the hot dog.

2605
02:51:55,070 --> 02:51:56,030
One second.

2606
02:51:56,130 --> 02:51:56,750
Hold on brother.

2607
02:51:57,810 --> 02:51:58,410
Stop.

2608
02:51:59,450 --> 02:52:01,150
3.0 Ray W is wild.

2609
02:52:01,310 --> 02:52:02,310
Congrats again on that.

2610
02:52:02,850 --> 02:52:03,530
Thank you.

2611
02:52:05,430 --> 02:52:08,750
I honestly was like so shocked at how...

2612
02:52:10,610 --> 02:52:12,750
Many people like...

2613
02:52:17,330 --> 02:52:19,050
Oh there's a guy right there!

2614
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:28,080
Oh god, I didn't even get the thing.

2615
02:52:29,880 --> 02:52:31,420
What is this cruel?

2616
02:52:32,120 --> 02:52:34,060
What is...This is a cruel mistress.

2617
02:52:34,970 --> 02:52:37,180
I didn't even want to go on the boat.

2618
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,260
Spooky level.

2619
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:43,940
Spooky time!

2620
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:49,060
I really...Before the debut I was like...

2621
02:52:49,620 --> 02:52:51,380
Kind of wracking my brain about it.

2622
02:52:51,440 --> 02:52:57,380
I was like, I feel like I have not enough at all.

2623
02:52:57,380 --> 02:52:57,420
I feel like I have not enough at all.

2624
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:03,380
I was seriously like...

2625
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:07,480
I need to have something else.

2626
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:12,800
There was like just one...

2627
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:15,060
Something else that I wanted more.

2628
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,860
But I'm glad that people liked it still regardless.

2629
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:23,260
Even the moon is spooky.

2630
02:53:28,110 --> 02:53:28,910
Oh no.

2631
02:53:29,550 --> 02:53:30,730
Wait, what do these guys do again?

2632
02:53:32,730 --> 02:53:34,130
Why are you staring at me like that?

2633
02:53:36,770 --> 02:53:37,790
We loved him.

2634
02:53:38,310 --> 02:53:39,690
I'm happy about that then.

2635
02:53:43,350 --> 02:53:43,890
Oh

2636
02:53:48,140 --> 02:53:50,040
come on, what a jerk.

2637
02:53:51,400 --> 02:53:53,140
Wait, what the hell?

2638
02:53:54,860 --> 02:53:56,300
He moves out of the way.

2639
02:53:57,820 --> 02:53:59,460
This guy is such a jerk.

2640
02:54:08,450 --> 02:54:11,250
It's already...It's not enough that I have to be in this shit fountain?

2641
02:54:11,910 --> 02:54:14,070
And then you are also gonna be such an ass to me?

2642
02:54:14,670 --> 02:54:15,330
Come on!

2643
02:54:17,790 --> 02:54:20,530
Let that serve as a reminder that we are always behind you.

2644
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:21,910
Thank you.

2645
02:54:23,350 --> 02:54:27,030
Why can't I...I'm in a literal fountain of shit and I can't...

2646
02:54:27,030 --> 02:54:28,070
This bird sucks.

2647
02:54:28,070 --> 02:54:29,690
Look, he is staring at me like...

2648
02:54:29,690 --> 02:54:31,130
Are you trying to get that?

2649
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:33,210
How do I get this?

2650
02:54:35,490 --> 02:54:37,050
Is there anything else?

2651
02:54:39,570 --> 02:54:41,150
This guy sucks.

2652
02:54:44,230 --> 02:54:46,090
Oh my god, I give up.

2653
02:54:51,830 --> 02:54:53,870
Maybe there is a power-up.

2654
02:54:57,970 --> 02:54:58,810
Maybe this?

2655
02:55:02,070 --> 02:55:02,650
Oh.

2656
02:55:05,110 --> 02:55:05,690
It's...

2657
02:55:06,730 --> 02:55:08,230
Oh, it's this one.

2658
02:55:09,250 --> 02:55:11,290
It's the slow down time thing.

2659
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:12,990
Oh gosh.

2660
02:55:13,790 --> 02:55:15,310
I'm not very good at this one, I think.

2661
02:55:15,970 --> 02:55:17,150
I guess we are gonna get good.

2662
02:55:26,810 --> 02:55:27,930
Haha, to you.

2663
02:55:28,890 --> 02:55:29,470
Stupid.

2664
02:55:31,390 --> 02:55:31,970
Idiot.

2665
02:55:33,230 --> 02:55:33,990
Dummy jerk.

2666
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:46,360
Too slow.

2667
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:52,240
Are you telling us we have bad taste for getting excited about things you do?

2668
02:55:52,920 --> 02:55:57,080
I just have, I think, very high expectations.

2669
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:00,760
So...

2670
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:03,020
In my brain, I'm just like...

2671
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:04,560
It was not enough.

2672
02:56:05,980 --> 02:56:09,300
So I believe that to be so.

2673
02:56:10,860 --> 02:56:11,440
You know?

2674
02:56:14,570 --> 02:56:17,310
I have pretty high expectations.

2675
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:26,220
How do I get that guy up there?

2676
02:56:33,250 --> 02:56:33,990
Oh my goodness.

2677
02:56:37,090 --> 02:56:38,270
Oh shoot.

2678
02:56:40,590 --> 02:56:41,190
Nice.

2679
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:44,370
Got our first guy.

2680
02:56:47,250 --> 02:56:49,210
Those high expectations were exceeded?

2681
02:56:49,810 --> 02:56:51,210
I'm glad you think so.

2682
02:56:52,210 --> 02:56:53,590
Oh my god.

2683
02:56:57,870 --> 02:56:58,710
Oh my god.

2684
02:56:59,470 --> 02:57:00,470
Get his butt.

2685
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:08,680
Oh my god.

2686
02:57:08,740 --> 02:57:09,940
I can't get him.

2687
02:57:11,700 --> 02:57:12,420
Come here.

2688
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:14,580
Come here.

2689
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:24,920
Nice.

2690
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:26,880
Alright.

2691
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:32,020
These are so silly.

2692
02:57:32,560 --> 02:57:34,340
These are so silly.

2693
02:57:37,700 --> 02:57:38,180
Nice.

2694
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:55,080
I'm going to my mic instead of...

2695
02:58:07,780 --> 02:58:09,980
Like this mic instead of...

2696
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:13,480
Instead of...

2697
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:16,720
Instead of the mic on the...

2698
02:58:18,980 --> 02:58:19,440
Nice.

2699
02:58:23,740 --> 02:58:24,540
Kill him.

2700
02:58:25,840 --> 02:58:27,360
Who is this?

2701
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:29,980
Who is this?

2702
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:32,040
Alpha male.

2703
02:58:32,480 --> 02:58:34,080
Could do with some piano lessons.

2704
02:58:34,760 --> 02:58:35,820
What the hell are you?

2705
02:58:46,540 --> 02:58:47,640
What's over here?

2706
02:58:47,720 --> 02:58:47,960
Anything?

2707
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:50,700
Anything over here?

2708
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:51,260
No.

2709
02:58:52,360 --> 02:58:53,640
Nothing of value?

2710
02:58:53,900 --> 02:58:54,180
OK.

2711
02:58:55,260 --> 02:58:56,820
Why let me walk over here then?

2712
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:01,580
Music is so fun.

2713
02:59:14,520 --> 02:59:15,800
Chris Redfield.

2714
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:17,600
Sorry, I was just like who is that again?

2715
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:19,420
Oh shoot.

2716
02:59:19,620 --> 02:59:19,700
OK.

2717
02:59:20,700 --> 02:59:21,620
I remember now.

2718
02:59:28,970 --> 02:59:29,830
Oh shoot.

2719
02:59:30,670 --> 02:59:31,530
I'm dead.

2720
02:59:32,970 --> 02:59:34,790
At least I got the...

2721
02:59:34,790 --> 02:59:37,410
At least I got the puzzle piece.

2722
02:59:44,290 --> 02:59:44,930
Shoot.

2723
02:59:45,990 --> 02:59:48,090
Guys, I didn't make it in time.

2724
02:59:49,490 --> 02:59:49,770
No!

2725
02:59:56,790 --> 02:59:59,590
This is like the perfect... You got to be perfectly timed.

2726
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:14,240
I missed a thing over there.

2727
03:00:14,500 --> 03:00:14,900
No!

2728
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,100
Really got to be looking over the edges more often.

2729
03:00:21,500 --> 03:00:24,100
Got to be thinking about... I got to be living on the edge.

2730
03:00:24,320 --> 03:00:26,000
I got to be like...

2731
03:00:26,860 --> 03:00:28,340
You know what?

2732
03:00:28,340 --> 03:00:29,520
I'm not going to deal with you guys.

2733
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:38,200
In fact, you neither.

2734
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:46,480
Take them out.

2735
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:46,980
Take them out.

2736
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:47,680
Take them out.

2737
03:00:49,960 --> 03:00:51,960
Who knew her greed had limits?

2738
03:00:52,180 --> 03:00:53,000
Doesn't really.

2739
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:54,860
I'm ultimate greedy.

2740
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:58,400
I'm super greedy.

2741
03:01:02,380 --> 03:01:05,440
I barely... I just... I barely tapped him.

2742
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:15,660
Let's just go.

2743
03:01:18,340 --> 03:01:19,480
What's up there?

2744
03:01:19,660 --> 03:01:21,200
That makes me need to jump, huh?

2745
03:01:24,780 --> 03:01:25,460
Get him!

2746
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:28,780
I give me to winner.

2747
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:31,520
Thank you, Barbos.

2748
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:38,280
Was that... Did I miss anybody?

2749
03:01:38,580 --> 03:01:38,980
Ok, no.

2750
03:01:39,220 --> 03:01:39,900
Good, good, good, good.

2751
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:41,940
Good, good, good, good, good.

2752
03:01:45,020 --> 03:01:45,980
Anything up here?

2753
03:01:53,020 --> 03:01:53,520
Nice.

2754
03:01:53,920 --> 03:01:54,920
That's a... Wait.

2755
03:01:57,460 --> 03:01:59,020
I knew it was a trap.

2756
03:02:00,680 --> 03:02:02,100
He was jumping up and down.

2757
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:05,220
But we did get the bubbles up here.

2758
03:02:07,340 --> 03:02:08,820
Yippee-ki-yay!

2759
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:13,020
Any other things over here?

2760
03:02:13,860 --> 03:02:15,360
Anything over here?

2761
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:17,460
Any hidden...

2762
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:18,520
Any... No?

2763
03:02:19,140 --> 03:02:19,460
Ok.

2764
03:02:22,710 --> 03:02:24,170
Nice reflexes.

2765
03:02:24,250 --> 03:02:24,790
Thank you.

2766
03:02:30,700 --> 03:02:31,960
Oh, goodness.

2767
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:38,290
Nice.

2768
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:41,450
We are killing it, you guys.

2769
03:02:42,830 --> 03:02:44,210
Yippee-ki-yay.

2770
03:02:44,870 --> 03:02:47,510
Yippee-ki-yay, I'm in Phantom!

2771
03:02:53,730 --> 03:02:58,210
It's usually like... One of these.

2772
03:03:02,370 --> 03:03:03,110
Oh no!

2773
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:14,260
Enjoy your recent 3.0.

2774
03:03:14,380 --> 03:03:15,060
Thank you!

2775
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:18,060
With the collabs.

2776
03:03:18,980 --> 03:03:19,560
Yeah!

2777
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:22,560
Lot of fun.

2778
03:03:22,980 --> 03:03:24,440
I'm glad you liked it.

2779
03:03:24,920 --> 03:03:26,280
Oh, big guy.

2780
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:29,380
Lots of money.

2781
03:03:31,640 --> 03:03:32,440
Nice!

2782
03:03:33,480 --> 03:03:34,680
Nice, nice, nice.

2783
03:03:35,060 --> 03:03:35,320
Ok.

2784
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:37,320
I hear someone laughing.

2785
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:44,320
Oh.

2786
03:03:44,980 --> 03:03:45,800
Let's grab that.

2787
03:03:48,920 --> 03:03:50,860
Oh my goodness.

2788
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:52,340
I thought I was gonna die.

2789
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:56,580
Holy moly.

2790
03:03:57,020 --> 03:04:00,040
I thought his teeth was gonna be so long.

2791
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:04,240
Oh, it's this thing again.

2792
03:04:04,660 --> 03:04:05,940
I remember doing this before.

2793
03:04:15,380 --> 03:04:17,060
And this way.

2794
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:20,120
What's this way though?

2795
03:04:25,060 --> 03:04:25,660
Mysterious.

2796
03:04:28,740 --> 03:04:30,180
What is this?

2797
03:04:30,880 --> 03:04:31,660
What is this?

2798
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:44,140
That's scary.

2799
03:04:44,560 --> 03:04:45,100
Oh my gosh.

2800
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:46,820
Oh my gosh, the lights go out.

2801
03:04:48,520 --> 03:04:49,200
Oh god.

2802
03:04:51,360 --> 03:04:51,920
Uh...

2803
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:52,820
Ah!

2804
03:04:52,980 --> 03:04:53,480
What?

2805
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:54,460
You can fall off!

2806
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:58,140
You can fall off of it?

2807
03:04:59,240 --> 03:04:59,800
Ok.

2808
03:05:00,480 --> 03:05:01,580
Holy moly.

2809
03:05:01,780 --> 03:05:03,200
I have to stop the time...

2810
03:05:04,800 --> 03:05:07,600
When the lights are on...

2811
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:09,660
So I don't fall off of the thing.

2812
03:05:09,780 --> 03:05:10,000
Ok.

2813
03:05:11,800 --> 03:05:12,840
What did I just... Oh.

2814
03:05:13,560 --> 03:05:14,560
Oh my gosh.

2815
03:05:20,860 --> 03:05:21,420
Hello.

2816
03:05:21,700 --> 03:05:24,720
Oh, it's another... Another Resident Evil.

2817
03:05:25,520 --> 03:05:26,380
Alpha Female.

2818
03:05:26,940 --> 03:05:28,320
The Master of Unlocking.

2819
03:05:29,020 --> 03:05:30,640
I don't know any other names though.

2820
03:05:30,640 --> 03:05:31,180
I feel terrible.

2821
03:05:32,080 --> 03:05:32,680
Chill.

2822
03:05:48,720 --> 03:05:49,320
And...

2823
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:50,800
Oh shoot.

2824
03:05:51,060 --> 03:05:51,740
Was I too early?

2825
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:52,920
Was I too early?

2826
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:55,760
We're good.

2827
03:05:57,520 --> 03:05:58,100
Throw!

2828
03:06:10,720 --> 03:06:13,720
Oh my gosh, I have to parkour...

2829
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:15,560
Off of...

2830
03:06:15,560 --> 03:06:17,360
His throw up.

2831
03:06:19,080 --> 03:06:19,960
Why are you eating garbage?

2832
03:06:23,480 --> 03:06:24,300
Too early.

2833
03:06:28,300 --> 03:06:29,500
Why are you eating garbage?

2834
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:31,840
That was so close.

2835
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:33,200
That was so...

2836
03:06:34,020 --> 03:06:35,660
Why are you eating garbage?

2837
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:40,580
It's Jill Sandwich.

2838
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:43,980
Oh I have to... Ok, this one is interesting.

2839
03:06:49,540 --> 03:06:50,020
Nice.

2840
03:06:53,400 --> 03:06:56,160
But don't... Why do I feel like I need to be inside there?

2841
03:06:57,720 --> 03:06:58,620
Oh my gosh.

2842
03:06:58,880 --> 03:06:59,780
Look at him go!

2843
03:06:59,900 --> 03:07:01,000
This poor little guy!

2844
03:07:01,360 --> 03:07:02,180
I got you!

2845
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:05,140
I don't... I do have you!

2846
03:07:06,460 --> 03:07:09,180
Nevermind, we don't need to be in there unless there was a...

2847
03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:11,840
You think there was a puzzle piece?

2848
03:07:11,860 --> 03:07:13,760
We still have one more puzzle piece to get.

2849
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:19,880
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running!

2850
03:07:22,040 --> 03:07:22,360
Nice.

2851
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:23,460
Nice, nice, nice.

2852
03:07:32,900 --> 03:07:33,700
Oh gosh.

2853
03:07:34,100 --> 03:07:35,360
These ghosts are annoying.

2854
03:07:48,800 --> 03:07:52,060
You think I'll be knocked off the... Ok, maybe I'll be fine here.

2855
03:07:52,180 --> 03:07:52,680
Ok, nice.

2856
03:07:54,680 --> 03:07:56,220
Where could the last puzzle piece be?

2857
03:07:59,820 --> 03:08:01,280
I wonder if I missed it already.

2858
03:08:02,120 --> 03:08:02,960
Did I miss my chance?

2859
03:08:02,960 --> 03:08:03,240
Oops.

2860
03:08:11,240 --> 03:08:12,500
I think I saw it.

2861
03:08:13,320 --> 03:08:14,460
I see it, it's in the tornado.

2862
03:08:14,940 --> 03:08:16,340
Oh yeah, I see it too!

2863
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:17,760
Good eye.

2864
03:08:19,240 --> 03:08:21,420
If I die, it's ok, it's worth it!

2865
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:25,360
It was worth it!

2866
03:08:31,030 --> 03:08:32,650
Good eye guys, thank you.

2867
03:08:34,610 --> 03:08:35,210
Oh shoot.

2868
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:42,390
Can you even get it with... I don't think so.

2869
03:08:42,450 --> 03:08:43,390
It was sideways, right?

2870
03:08:45,410 --> 03:08:48,890
Maybe here is the best... route!

2871
03:08:49,570 --> 03:08:51,010
Oh gosh, that was so close.

2872
03:08:54,970 --> 03:08:59,690
Wait, how do I... I have to smash it?

2873
03:09:08,530 --> 03:09:09,010
Yeah!

2874
03:09:09,550 --> 03:09:10,590
We did it!

2875
03:09:10,590 --> 03:09:12,470
Wasn't there a warp in here though?

2876
03:09:12,970 --> 03:09:13,970
Oh no, there wasn't.

2877
03:09:14,170 --> 03:09:15,010
100% baby.

2878
03:09:15,350 --> 03:09:19,430
Of course I would 100% the spooky place, of course I would.

2879
03:09:39,620 --> 03:09:40,820
Send my guys home.

2880
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:41,900
How many do I have now?

2881
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:43,040
195.

2882
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:46,000
Oh my gosh, we're so close to the...

2883
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:50,360
We're so close to the...

2884
03:09:51,820 --> 03:09:54,360
If I do this one, we'll be able to get the 200.

2885
03:09:58,890 --> 03:09:59,830
Wow!

2886
03:10:01,050 --> 03:10:02,950
Under the sea!

2887
03:10:05,130 --> 03:10:06,870
Under the sea!

2888
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:10,690
It's quiet.

2889
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:14,090
Too quiet.

2890
03:10:15,900 --> 03:10:16,750
Who's breathing?

2891
03:10:17,950 --> 03:10:19,170
This guy?

2892
03:10:19,710 --> 03:10:20,190
Wake up.

2893
03:10:21,250 --> 03:10:23,250
Stop breathing like that, it's annoying me.

2894
03:10:29,610 --> 03:10:31,250
Doom, doom, doom, doom.

2895
03:10:32,370 --> 03:10:35,830
This is like the most underwater level sound ever.

2896
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:52,350
Who's making that sound?

2897
03:10:52,910 --> 03:10:53,930
There's sounds everywhere.

2898
03:10:57,340 --> 03:10:59,020
Is there stuff above the water too?

2899
03:10:59,880 --> 03:11:01,140
Like what's over there, you know?

2900
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:03,540
Oh see, there is stuff above the water.

2901
03:11:05,300 --> 03:11:06,460
We must be vigilant.

2902
03:11:07,880 --> 03:11:11,980
Gamers, we must look up for the first time in our lives and after lives.

2903
03:11:13,980 --> 03:11:15,240
Gamers, we gotta look up.

2904
03:11:25,470 --> 03:11:28,650
Oh my gosh, I almost didn't get that guy.

2905
03:11:29,870 --> 03:11:30,790
What do you need me to do?

2906
03:11:30,950 --> 03:11:31,990
Punch you in the face?

2907
03:11:34,330 --> 03:11:36,110
Stop being such a little bitch.

2908
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:39,010
Thank you.

2909
03:11:41,490 --> 03:11:42,470
Penguin!

2910
03:11:43,330 --> 03:11:44,770
What does it do?

2911
03:11:51,190 --> 03:11:52,170
Nice!

2912
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:55,330
Can I like speed jump?

2913
03:11:56,890 --> 03:11:58,790
Oh my god, I'm beautiful!

2914
03:12:13,400 --> 03:12:16,480
This level reminds me of Spyro so much.

2915
03:12:19,140 --> 03:12:20,460
Sorry bananas.

2916
03:12:27,820 --> 03:12:28,820
Little monkey.

2917
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:32,480
You're not gonna catch anything with a banana.

2918
03:12:33,780 --> 03:12:35,440
No fish wants to eat a banana.

2919
03:12:39,580 --> 03:12:40,500
Kinda does.

2920
03:12:40,860 --> 03:12:44,000
This one reminds me of Spyro the most.

2921
03:12:44,600 --> 03:12:50,480
Because of the robotic fish and like the little guys.

2922
03:12:50,640 --> 03:12:51,200
I don't know why.

2923
03:12:51,500 --> 03:12:53,500
I mean, I know why, but like...

2924
03:12:54,140 --> 03:12:56,020
It just reminds me of Spyro, that's all.

2925
03:12:56,820 --> 03:12:57,440
That's all.

2926
03:12:58,900 --> 03:13:00,260
Not even a banana fish?

2927
03:13:00,620 --> 03:13:02,120
Not even a banana fish.

2928
03:13:02,840 --> 03:13:03,240
Oh my goodness.

2929
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:07,880
I got all of those in one go.

2930
03:13:08,680 --> 03:13:09,360
Oh my goodness.

2931
03:13:09,900 --> 03:13:12,300
I'm guessing we're gonna have to crash into you.

2932
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:15,460
Holy moly.

2933
03:13:18,900 --> 03:13:20,580
Maybe... How do I defeat you?

2934
03:13:24,080 --> 03:13:25,380
Not like that!

2935
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:29,760
I don't think we... I don't think we... I don't think we do that.

2936
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:34,020
Oh my gosh.

2937
03:13:34,600 --> 03:13:37,680
This is not the easiest way to swim.

2938
03:13:38,860 --> 03:13:39,240
There we go.

2939
03:13:39,820 --> 03:13:42,280
Go, go, go!

2940
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:44,420
Please,

2941
03:13:48,060 --> 03:13:48,640
I want the money.

2942
03:13:49,560 --> 03:13:51,280
Please, just give me the... OK, there we go.

2943
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:53,640
It's making me dizzy here.

2944
03:13:54,520 --> 03:13:56,200
It's making me dizzy.

2945
03:13:59,740 --> 03:14:01,400
Did I get all of it?

2946
03:14:01,780 --> 03:14:02,060
No.

2947
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:11,220
Let me try again.

2948
03:14:16,360 --> 03:14:17,600
Let me try again.

2949
03:14:19,740 --> 03:14:21,280
I don't really like the swimming.

2950
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:23,660
You know what?

2951
03:14:23,720 --> 03:14:24,100
Good enough.

2952
03:14:24,820 --> 03:14:26,200
Whatever, good enough!

2953
03:14:26,200 --> 03:14:28,500
Oh gosh.

2954
03:14:28,820 --> 03:14:30,540
I'm so bad at this.

2955
03:14:51,700 --> 03:14:52,820
Sorry.

2956
03:14:55,280 --> 03:14:56,180
Oh no!

2957
03:15:03,800 --> 03:15:09,740
I gotta kick him in the face.

2958
03:15:10,780 --> 03:15:13,760
Thank you!

2959
03:15:15,280 --> 03:15:16,480
Stop being sad.

2960
03:15:17,020 --> 03:15:18,880
Just go for a walk.

2961
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:20,960
Stop being sad.

2962
03:15:21,560 --> 03:15:22,540
Punch you in the face.

2963
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:25,960
I wish all my bullies punched me in the face.

2964
03:15:26,740 --> 03:15:28,680
I would have not been so sad.

2965
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:35,280
I did not expect this to be what happened with the...

2966
03:15:35,980 --> 03:15:37,120
You know, like...

2967
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:40,280
Hearing that epic chorus and then...

2968
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:43,860
And then it just became...

2969
03:15:43,860 --> 03:15:47,720
It just became this chill track.

2970
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:49,420
What happened?

2971
03:15:50,020 --> 03:15:50,940
So silly.

2972
03:15:53,740 --> 03:15:54,680
Nothing really?

2973
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:16,280
Oh there is a puzzle piece.

2974
03:16:16,320 --> 03:16:16,960
How many puzzle pieces?

2975
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:19,880
We haven't gotten anything you guys.

2976
03:16:20,240 --> 03:16:20,800
Am I...

2977
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:23,920
I just realized we haven't gotten any guys.

2978
03:16:24,180 --> 03:16:27,020
Have I missed them or am I just...

2979
03:16:27,020 --> 03:16:28,160
Or are they all in here?

2980
03:16:28,780 --> 03:16:30,560
There is no way, right?

2981
03:16:41,180 --> 03:16:43,440
I didn't grow up with Spongebob and I always wondered...

2982
03:16:43,440 --> 03:16:45,320
Is the pink fat starfish the Krusty Krab?

2983
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:46,780
What do you mean?

2984
03:16:46,840 --> 03:16:47,840
Is he the Krusty Krab?

2985
03:16:52,080 --> 03:16:53,580
No, this is Patrick.

2986
03:17:01,330 --> 03:17:02,550
They are all in here.

2987
03:17:02,650 --> 03:17:03,590
This is a really big level.

2988
03:17:05,990 --> 03:17:08,330
We gotta free our starfish friend.

2989
03:17:09,190 --> 03:17:10,050
What's up there?

2990
03:17:10,290 --> 03:17:10,570
Money.

2991
03:17:13,310 --> 03:17:14,190
Money in here.

2992
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:20,900
Where are our friends?

2993
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:24,900
At least it kind of mixes the...

2994
03:17:24,900 --> 03:17:28,480
What happens if I make it?

2995
03:17:31,860 --> 03:17:33,060
Ok, hold on.

2996
03:17:33,640 --> 03:17:35,300
Hold on, I'll do it too.

2997
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:37,820
I can do this too.

2998
03:17:45,150 --> 03:17:46,110
Come on!

2999
03:17:54,760 --> 03:17:55,740
Jumping through hoops!

3000
03:17:55,940 --> 03:17:57,280
I got a trophy for it even.

3001
03:17:58,880 --> 03:18:00,000
Nice, let's go.

3002
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:05,100
Let's try this guy out.

3003
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:09,720
Let's just... I don't know why I chose this guy to be there first.

3004
03:18:10,980 --> 03:18:11,720
I don't know why.

3005
03:18:18,340 --> 03:18:20,340
This area is really big.

3006
03:18:20,380 --> 03:18:22,300
There is so much to go around in here.

3007
03:18:25,440 --> 03:18:26,640
Our second one.

3008
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:28,160
I see, I see.

3009
03:18:29,980 --> 03:18:34,200
The first one, it must be surely that one being surrounded by the spikes.

3010
03:18:35,320 --> 03:18:36,800
Surely, surely, surely.

3011
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:42,780
This area is huge!

3012
03:18:43,140 --> 03:18:44,200
There is a ship.

3013
03:18:44,660 --> 03:18:45,580
There is everything.

3014
03:18:46,020 --> 03:18:47,460
Oh my gosh, there is a guy stuck in here.

3015
03:18:48,860 --> 03:18:49,980
We'll get him, we'll get him.

3016
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:56,100
It's our first guy, actually.

3017
03:18:57,800 --> 03:18:58,840
Free Patrick Star.

3018
03:19:07,380 --> 03:19:11,160
Let's get these guys down here because they are ruining my vibe.

3019
03:19:11,640 --> 03:19:12,220
Oh gosh.

3020
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:21,720
Oi!

3021
03:19:25,040 --> 03:19:27,000
Yeah, you want some of this?

3022
03:19:30,220 --> 03:19:31,340
Too slow.

3023
03:19:32,820 --> 03:19:34,280
Oh my god, look at them run!

3024
03:19:35,560 --> 03:19:36,120
Dummies.

3025
03:19:40,840 --> 03:19:43,660
Oh wow, there is a lot going on in here, isn't there?

3026
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:51,580
Alright, two...three...

3027
03:19:52,800 --> 03:19:53,680
and four.

3028
03:19:56,340 --> 03:19:56,780
Yes!

3029
03:20:03,300 --> 03:20:04,980
I think I have to enter from the top.

3030
03:20:09,860 --> 03:20:10,300
Hello!

3031
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:13,540
Look, he waved at me.

3032
03:20:14,280 --> 03:20:15,480
He is waving at me.

3033
03:20:17,540 --> 03:20:18,800
Can I kill these guys?

3034
03:20:18,960 --> 03:20:20,700
Actually, I don't think I need to do anything with them.

3035
03:20:21,180 --> 03:20:22,680
They got their own...

3036
03:20:22,680 --> 03:20:24,320
They are handling things on their own.

3037
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:26,160
I wonder if you can hit their goggles.

3038
03:20:27,640 --> 03:20:29,480
Maybe, but I don't want to try.

3039
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:32,780
I don't want to try...

3040
03:20:32,780 --> 03:20:34,680
because I don't know where...

3041
03:20:34,680 --> 03:20:38,220
There hasn't been like a safe point, like a checkpoint, you know?

3042
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:39,860
Take the money.

3043
03:20:45,320 --> 03:20:46,100
What's in here?

3044
03:20:48,460 --> 03:20:49,900
Oh...

3045
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:54,660
Oh my gosh!

3046
03:20:58,470 --> 03:20:59,050
I got you!

3047
03:20:59,890 --> 03:21:01,150
I got him!

3048
03:21:02,090 --> 03:21:03,170
Number two!

3049
03:21:06,940 --> 03:21:09,770
I want to get these guys though.

3050
03:21:14,790 --> 03:21:18,090
I can't get low enough.

3051
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:26,760
No one?

3052
03:21:27,120 --> 03:21:27,940
No survivors.

3053
03:21:29,180 --> 03:21:30,020
Oh my gosh.

3054
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:30,760
No!

3055
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:31,660
There are so many!

3056
03:21:32,540 --> 03:21:33,800
No survivors.

3057
03:21:41,500 --> 03:21:42,940
Holy moly!

3058
03:21:56,890 --> 03:21:59,310
There is so much going on in this level, huh?

3059
03:22:01,710 --> 03:22:02,430
Hi!

3060
03:22:04,330 --> 03:22:05,050
Hey!

3061
03:22:06,010 --> 03:22:06,410
Oh!

3062
03:22:06,650 --> 03:22:06,950
Hey!

3063
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:17,110
I'll never forgive you.

3064
03:22:28,050 --> 03:22:28,990
What's in here?

3065
03:22:31,370 --> 03:22:32,330
Bad guys!

3066
03:22:36,240 --> 03:22:36,820
Oh!

3067
03:22:36,900 --> 03:22:37,820
I destroyed another one!

3068
03:22:38,120 --> 03:22:38,620
Let's go.

3069
03:22:39,400 --> 03:22:40,500
He is getting happier.

3070
03:22:40,660 --> 03:22:41,260
He is getting happier.

3071
03:22:42,560 --> 03:22:43,860
Thank you for the friend!

3072
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:47,320
Thank you!

3073
03:22:48,380 --> 03:22:49,440
Thank you!

3074
03:22:49,540 --> 03:22:50,160
Welcome back!

3075
03:22:50,940 --> 03:22:51,700
Look,

3076
03:22:54,840 --> 03:22:55,980
we are playing Astro Bot.

3077
03:23:00,340 --> 03:23:02,700
And it's very cute.

3078
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:05,680
But these levels are killing me.

3079
03:23:06,480 --> 03:23:07,720
And I'm already dead.

3080
03:23:12,170 --> 03:23:12,630
Oh my god!

3081
03:23:12,850 --> 03:23:14,530
It was so close!

3082
03:23:14,930 --> 03:23:15,970
My reflexes.

3083
03:23:16,530 --> 03:23:19,030
My insane reflexes.

3084
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:23,380
Yeah!

3085
03:23:26,770 --> 03:23:28,250
Oh, we gotta get this guy.

3086
03:23:28,650 --> 03:23:29,690
I just remembered him.

3087
03:23:32,570 --> 03:23:33,830
Raymagnix for the 515!

3088
03:23:41,090 --> 03:23:42,810
Gamer reflexes, everybody.

3089
03:23:44,050 --> 03:23:45,210
Don't you forget it.

3090
03:23:46,730 --> 03:23:47,890
Oh, sorry monkey.

3091
03:23:50,970 --> 03:23:52,970
I made him drop his...

3092
03:23:52,970 --> 03:23:56,730
I made him drop his fishing pole.

3093
03:23:57,350 --> 03:23:58,370
Sorry monkey.

3094
03:24:03,580 --> 03:24:04,180
What?

3095
03:24:04,700 --> 03:24:05,700
That should have counted.

3096
03:24:06,940 --> 03:24:08,160
That should have counted.

3097
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:09,000
That should have counted.

3098
03:24:13,070 --> 03:24:14,030
Oh my god.

3099
03:24:14,650 --> 03:24:16,070
I'm never gonna get him at this rate.

3100
03:24:17,730 --> 03:24:18,550
Oh my gosh.

3101
03:24:20,730 --> 03:24:22,270
Ok, hold on.

3102
03:24:23,010 --> 03:24:23,650
He can wait.

3103
03:24:24,370 --> 03:24:24,770
When

3104
03:24:29,210 --> 03:24:32,590
did his last save?

3105
03:24:33,150 --> 03:24:34,570
No, we don't know.

3106
03:24:34,690 --> 03:24:35,330
I don't know.

3107
03:24:35,750 --> 03:24:37,450
Ok, that is gone.

3108
03:24:38,290 --> 03:24:39,770
Where did it last save?

3109
03:24:41,070 --> 03:24:42,910
Did I do this thing in here?

3110
03:24:44,650 --> 03:24:45,510
Let's check.

3111
03:24:47,890 --> 03:24:48,810
Oh, hello.

3112
03:24:52,170 --> 03:24:54,310
Yes, I think it counted.

3113
03:24:55,950 --> 03:24:56,850
I think.

3114
03:24:59,330 --> 03:25:00,690
Oh, is that a guy over there?

3115
03:25:04,530 --> 03:25:05,070
Please!

3116
03:25:06,930 --> 03:25:08,250
What the hell is this?

3117
03:25:08,650 --> 03:25:09,750
Secret octopus.

3118
03:25:10,230 --> 03:25:11,530
Nobody suspects a thing.

3119
03:25:12,370 --> 03:25:13,570
Who is this?

3120
03:25:16,390 --> 03:25:17,710
The guy in the platform?

3121
03:25:17,870 --> 03:25:19,150
Is he not on the platform?

3122
03:25:19,390 --> 03:25:20,810
Or is he back on the platform?

3123
03:25:21,050 --> 03:25:25,790
I kinda hate this level.

3124
03:25:27,990 --> 03:25:30,050
I kinda hate this level.

3125
03:25:30,850 --> 03:25:31,450
Oh.

3126
03:25:32,950 --> 03:25:35,650
All my homies hate water levels.

3127
03:25:36,190 --> 03:25:37,130
No matter the game.

3128
03:25:39,290 --> 03:25:39,890
Octodad.

3129
03:25:42,130 --> 03:25:43,490
I can't get that one.

3130
03:25:44,330 --> 03:25:44,890
I give up.

3131
03:26:02,610 --> 03:26:04,890
Definitely my least favorite level so far.

3132
03:26:07,430 --> 03:26:08,190
That's right.

3133
03:26:08,290 --> 03:26:09,910
And I gotta grab him and I gotta...

3134
03:26:09,910 --> 03:26:10,270
Wow!

3135
03:26:13,970 --> 03:26:14,450
Nice.

3136
03:26:15,030 --> 03:26:16,550
Hey, leave him alone!

3137
03:26:19,870 --> 03:26:21,110
Never trust water.

3138
03:26:22,290 --> 03:26:23,670
Oh no, he is still in the spaceship.

3139
03:26:23,970 --> 03:26:24,770
I see him over there.

3140
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:25,350
Ok, good.

3141
03:26:28,230 --> 03:26:29,790
How many more guys do we have?

3142
03:26:31,490 --> 03:26:32,910
There is probably...

3143
03:26:33,510 --> 03:26:36,310
Ok, so we know where one is of those three.

3144
03:26:36,310 --> 03:26:39,950
And we need one more puzzle piece.

3145
03:26:40,470 --> 03:26:42,970
I'm surprised going through the hoop didn't give me a puzzle piece.

3146
03:26:50,650 --> 03:26:53,450
I'm sure there is a lot down there in the...

3147
03:26:54,050 --> 03:26:55,250
Don't look so sad.

3148
03:26:55,510 --> 03:26:56,770
You do the rest of the work.

3149
03:26:57,050 --> 03:26:59,290
Look, you can just slip your little arm out of there.

3150
03:26:59,470 --> 03:27:00,590
I did everything!

3151
03:27:06,940 --> 03:27:08,300
This is really relaxing.

3152
03:27:08,460 --> 03:27:09,300
Do you guys hear the water?

3153
03:27:15,300 --> 03:27:17,160
It's really relaxing actually.

3154
03:27:17,160 --> 03:27:20,620
Hold on, can I turn off the music?

3155
03:27:21,100 --> 03:27:21,520
Let's see.

3156
03:27:22,120 --> 03:27:33,500
My eyes are really starting to get bad with that headache.

3157
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:44,040
It's nice though.

3158
03:27:44,440 --> 03:27:45,520
It's very relaxing.

3159
03:27:46,440 --> 03:27:47,080
Oh.

3160
03:27:47,340 --> 03:27:47,880
Oh.

3161
03:27:48,280 --> 03:27:48,900
Oh.

3162
03:27:51,020 --> 03:27:52,560
What the hell?

3163
03:27:52,920 --> 03:27:54,900
What am I doing these moves for?

3164
03:27:57,580 --> 03:27:58,220
Nice!

3165
03:28:02,830 --> 03:28:05,690
I do have a blue filter on the screen.

3166
03:28:05,850 --> 03:28:06,190
I do.

3167
03:28:06,530 --> 03:28:07,690
A blue light filter.

3168
03:28:09,030 --> 03:28:11,210
So, I don't think it's that.

3169
03:28:11,630 --> 03:28:13,970
I think it's...I'm honestly not quite sure.

3170
03:28:17,670 --> 03:28:19,210
Hopefully nothing serious.

3171
03:28:21,870 --> 03:28:23,790
Because it just kind of started like yesterday.

3172
03:28:24,190 --> 03:28:28,970
If I look around with my eyes in a certain way...

3173
03:28:30,990 --> 03:28:32,590
It just starts to hurt.

3174
03:28:34,870 --> 03:28:36,110
So I'm like...

3175
03:28:36,950 --> 03:28:37,630
Dang it!

3176
03:28:42,280 --> 03:28:44,340
My game time for the week is run out.

3177
03:28:44,480 --> 03:28:44,820
Truly.

3178
03:28:46,740 --> 03:28:48,440
No more game for me.

3179
03:28:49,320 --> 03:28:50,760
Time to stop being a gamer.

3180
03:28:52,280 --> 03:28:54,500
I've been game...I'm too much of a gamer.

3181
03:28:56,180 --> 03:28:57,600
Gamer too hard.

3182
03:28:59,940 --> 03:29:00,800
What's in here?

3183
03:29:01,580 --> 03:29:02,160
Oh, hello.

3184
03:29:03,060 --> 03:29:04,080
Wait, wait, wait.

3185
03:29:04,180 --> 03:29:05,240
Oh gosh, you guys are fast.

3186
03:29:12,430 --> 03:29:14,750
I should be the final one.

3187
03:29:19,190 --> 03:29:19,810
Yippee!

3188
03:29:24,100 --> 03:29:26,040
Alright, but we still have much to do.

3189
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:29,900
We still have much to do.

3190
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:30,820
Yes.

3191
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:32,840
Oh hello, who's this?

3192
03:29:33,820 --> 03:29:34,880
Just a guy.

3193
03:29:38,560 --> 03:29:42,360
Alright, so we know where the last normal guy is.

3194
03:29:43,520 --> 03:29:46,800
Our special guy is...Doko.

3195
03:29:47,800 --> 03:29:49,440
The music is so cute.

3196
03:29:59,880 --> 03:30:01,540
Slow-mo.

3197
03:30:06,550 --> 03:30:08,930
Let's beat this guy up.

3198
03:30:11,310 --> 03:30:12,690
Freak phantom gaming.

3199
03:30:15,030 --> 03:30:16,530
I'm a freak.

3200
03:30:16,990 --> 03:30:17,890
I'm a phantom.

3201
03:30:19,730 --> 03:30:21,170
I'm a freak phantom.

3202
03:30:36,340 --> 03:30:37,200
Oh no!

3203
03:30:41,500 --> 03:30:44,120
Kick this guy's butt.

3204
03:30:44,780 --> 03:30:45,700
Kick their butt.

3205
03:30:45,800 --> 03:30:46,740
Oh I hear someone.

3206
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:47,360
Oh there he is.

3207
03:30:51,640 --> 03:30:54,040
Getting a little bit more used to the swimming.

3208
03:30:54,580 --> 03:30:54,840
Luckily.

3209
03:31:09,540 --> 03:31:10,080
Secret.

3210
03:31:11,920 --> 03:31:12,700
Secret.

3211
03:31:18,760 --> 03:31:19,540
Secret.

3212
03:31:20,640 --> 03:31:21,840
Cat-like companion.

3213
03:31:22,440 --> 03:31:25,440
A perfect partner to their Meowsternya.

3214
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:30,040
Wait, is this the Monster Hunter cat?

3215
03:31:31,360 --> 03:31:32,140
Is it?

3216
03:31:33,220 --> 03:31:34,000
Secret.

3217
03:31:34,960 --> 03:31:36,340
How do I get out of this guy?

3218
03:31:37,980 --> 03:31:40,980
Do I tickle his uvula?

3219
03:31:42,460 --> 03:31:43,380
Tickle, tickle.

3220
03:31:43,980 --> 03:31:44,660
Let me out.

3221
03:31:46,940 --> 03:31:47,760
Thank you.

3222
03:31:52,480 --> 03:31:54,200
Oh my gosh, I almost missed that.

3223
03:31:54,280 --> 03:31:54,620
Crazy.

3224
03:31:56,580 --> 03:31:59,500
Alright, now we just gotta get that one last guy and we're good to go.

3225
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:04,400
Just gotta get that one guy from the alien.

3226
03:32:05,680 --> 03:32:07,180
And we are G2G.

3227
03:32:10,140 --> 03:32:12,980
Have you tried using the penguin not in the water?

3228
03:32:13,380 --> 03:32:16,080
Yeah, he just flaps his little flippers around.

3229
03:32:16,400 --> 03:32:17,500
Watch, watch, I'll show you.

3230
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:22,780
Watch him.

3231
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:23,840
He's so cute.

3232
03:32:28,040 --> 03:32:29,660
Just like that.

3233
03:32:35,310 --> 03:32:38,270
This part seems near impossible though.

3234
03:32:43,280 --> 03:32:44,760
He was looking for me.

3235
03:32:44,900 --> 03:32:46,120
I could have caught him off guard.

3236
03:32:49,360 --> 03:32:51,540
Maybe I need to sneak up behind him.

3237
03:32:51,660 --> 03:32:52,800
See, he doesn't notice me.

3238
03:32:53,400 --> 03:32:54,800
Maybe I need to sneak up behind him.

3239
03:32:57,360 --> 03:32:58,840
Sorry for the weird camera angle.

3240
03:33:02,040 --> 03:33:03,520
It's like pulling it, you know?

3241
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:04,820
So...

3242
03:33:12,090 --> 03:33:15,450
My days of Metal Gear has touched me.

3243
03:33:19,350 --> 03:33:20,790
Get stupid.

3244
03:33:23,730 --> 03:33:27,710
Kinda want this money here since it just keeps showing up, but...

3245
03:33:28,390 --> 03:33:29,330
Let's grab the money.

3246
03:33:37,820 --> 03:33:40,260
Sorry, I don't mean to tickle your tummy.

3247
03:33:40,360 --> 03:33:40,740
There we go.

3248
03:33:41,240 --> 03:33:42,140
I just want the money.

3249
03:33:45,280 --> 03:33:45,900
Alright.

3250
03:33:49,780 --> 03:33:50,400
Upwards!

3251
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:02,400
Hold on.

3252
03:34:03,520 --> 03:34:04,800
One moment please.

3253
03:34:05,880 --> 03:34:07,340
Everybody is clapping for me.

3254
03:34:08,320 --> 03:34:09,400
Everybody clapped.

3255
03:34:16,030 --> 03:34:17,110
Seven guys.

3256
03:34:30,990 --> 03:34:31,530
Yippee!

3257
03:34:31,570 --> 03:34:32,830
And we have so much money!

3258
03:34:33,770 --> 03:34:34,770
Good job guys.

3259
03:34:37,370 --> 03:34:39,870
So us, we are so good at this game.

3260
03:34:44,250 --> 03:34:45,650
We are so good at this game.

3261
03:34:47,630 --> 03:34:49,610
Did Octodad floss?

3262
03:34:50,010 --> 03:34:51,110
He might've.

3263
03:34:53,130 --> 03:34:54,370
Welcome to Astro Bot.

3264
03:34:55,430 --> 03:34:58,010
Where your favorite character will inevitably floss.

3265
03:34:58,350 --> 03:35:01,590
And you'll just lose years off of your life because of it.

3266
03:35:04,190 --> 03:35:04,870
Yay!

3267
03:35:11,440 --> 03:35:13,440
It's definitely something to behold.

3268
03:35:14,580 --> 03:35:16,540
Alright, everybody to your work.

3269
03:35:17,440 --> 03:35:18,660
Let's get some more gacha.

3270
03:35:18,660 --> 03:35:21,020
Oh, this is Safari Zone.

3271
03:35:21,360 --> 03:35:21,920
Here we go.

3272
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:23,160
More gacha!

3273
03:35:24,380 --> 03:35:26,020
But snake flossing was great.

3274
03:35:26,700 --> 03:35:29,740
I think great is a heavy word.

3275
03:35:31,340 --> 03:35:32,700
Enchanted paintbrush?

3276
03:35:33,160 --> 03:35:33,900
Who is this?

3277
03:35:33,960 --> 03:35:37,100
I think you guys probably said it before, but...

3278
03:35:37,100 --> 03:35:38,960
Transforms concrete into a canvas.

3279
03:35:40,700 --> 03:35:42,760
Is it like Life is Strange or something?

3280
03:35:44,420 --> 03:35:45,080
Dovenki?

3281
03:35:45,080 --> 03:35:46,040
What?

3282
03:35:50,410 --> 03:35:53,090
This weapon is such a drag.

3283
03:36:00,960 --> 03:36:03,260
That's quite the line to use.

3284
03:36:07,100 --> 03:36:07,900
For...

3285
03:36:09,860 --> 03:36:12,080
That's quite the line to use, huh?

3286
03:36:12,960 --> 03:36:15,060
Given, given...

3287
03:36:15,060 --> 03:36:17,000
Sort of what it...

3288
03:36:18,800 --> 03:36:20,280
It's from PT.

3289
03:36:21,320 --> 03:36:23,280
You know, but...

3290
03:36:23,820 --> 03:36:27,280
When you know who the dad was, you're just kind of like...

3291
03:36:30,180 --> 03:36:30,620
Cute!

3292
03:36:34,900 --> 03:36:35,700
Okay, next.

3293
03:36:37,960 --> 03:36:38,800
Doggy toys!

3294
03:36:39,300 --> 03:36:40,020
Oh my god, cute.

3295
03:36:40,380 --> 03:36:41,900
Irresistible to robotic dogs.

3296
03:36:42,040 --> 03:36:44,040
Well, he's not doing anything with it.

3297
03:36:44,660 --> 03:36:45,760
Okay, do something.

3298
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:50,380
If it's irresistible to the dog, why doesn't he play with it?

3299
03:36:53,260 --> 03:36:55,060
Controller skin?

3300
03:36:56,340 --> 03:36:57,440
Working.

3301
03:36:58,760 --> 03:36:59,600
Not a lilac.

3302
03:37:01,120 --> 03:37:01,820
Skin?

3303
03:37:02,620 --> 03:37:03,280
Outfit?

3304
03:37:03,820 --> 03:37:05,060
Golden outfit.

3305
03:37:06,280 --> 03:37:07,200
It's really pretty.

3306
03:37:08,220 --> 03:37:09,120
Five more?

3307
03:37:10,600 --> 03:37:12,100
Wind generator.

3308
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:13,280
Cute!

3309
03:37:16,220 --> 03:37:16,800
Brr.

3310
03:37:19,720 --> 03:37:20,880
Grateful calf.

3311
03:37:24,100 --> 03:37:26,320
Didn't it say friend of the elephant?

3312
03:37:37,340 --> 03:37:38,500
Outfit?

3313
03:37:45,330 --> 03:37:46,870
Last one.

3314
03:37:49,170 --> 03:37:50,790
Oh, for medieval!

3315
03:37:50,790 --> 03:37:51,010
Medieval!

3316
03:37:53,930 --> 03:37:54,250
Yippee!

3317
03:37:54,370 --> 03:37:54,650
You know what?

3318
03:37:54,650 --> 03:37:54,990
That's good.

3319
03:37:55,030 --> 03:37:55,970
That's a good one to end on.

3320
03:38:04,850 --> 03:38:06,430
Let's go see what Pyramid Head does.

3321
03:38:11,750 --> 03:38:16,610
Yeah, we do have 200 guys, so we'll go back to that one area.

3322
03:38:18,410 --> 03:38:20,190
Okay, let's go see Pyramid Head.

3323
03:38:30,290 --> 03:38:33,670
Are you okay?

3324
03:38:33,910 --> 03:38:38,390
Are you okay Pyramid Head?

3325
03:38:48,480 --> 03:38:50,220
These guys are so cute.

3326
03:38:51,580 --> 03:38:52,900
It was over here, right?

3327
03:38:53,620 --> 03:38:55,860
Bing, bong, bong, bong, bing.

3328
03:39:02,630 --> 03:39:03,910
Was there any other ones I wonder?

3329
03:39:04,010 --> 03:39:04,570
I can't remember.

3330
03:39:04,670 --> 03:39:06,970
I feel like we have to...

3331
03:39:07,590 --> 03:39:08,310
Oh gosh!

3332
03:39:08,650 --> 03:39:09,130
Oh gosh!

3333
03:39:09,330 --> 03:39:16,950
I wonder if I should go back to some of the other areas and see if there were ones that I missed because I didn't have enough people.

3334
03:39:21,310 --> 03:39:22,590
This one we can do now!

3335
03:39:25,850 --> 03:39:28,170
I don't understand what's going to happen though.

3336
03:39:28,990 --> 03:39:30,010
Oh, we are lifting.

3337
03:39:33,650 --> 03:39:35,690
Holy moly, look at all these guys!

3338
03:39:39,110 --> 03:39:40,090
It's a cake.

3339
03:39:42,430 --> 03:39:43,390
Excuse me.

3340
03:39:43,510 --> 03:39:43,810
Sorry.

3341
03:39:44,030 --> 03:39:44,590
Excuse me.

3342
03:39:44,710 --> 03:39:45,410
Excuse me.

3343
03:39:45,750 --> 03:39:46,390
Excuse me.

3344
03:39:48,630 --> 03:39:50,050
Wait, it's actually a cake.

3345
03:39:50,210 --> 03:39:50,770
Excuse me.

3346
03:39:51,050 --> 03:39:51,650
Excuse me.

3347
03:39:52,210 --> 03:39:53,470
What is this?

3348
03:39:55,210 --> 03:39:56,490
What

3349
03:40:02,850 --> 03:40:04,010
the fuck is this?

3350
03:40:06,190 --> 03:40:10,670
Leapin' Lipin', a true 3D platforming pioneer.

3351
03:40:12,690 --> 03:40:16,070
He just stood there.

3352
03:40:17,630 --> 03:40:20,530
He just stood there.

3353
03:40:23,870 --> 03:40:26,890
It was so anticlimactic.

3354
03:40:31,340 --> 03:40:33,060
He didn't even do anything.

3355
03:40:33,260 --> 03:40:36,420
He just was like, yeah, I'm a little guy.

3356
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:39,340
Alright, let's go to the other areas.

3357
03:40:39,440 --> 03:40:40,720
Is there anything...

3358
03:40:41,360 --> 03:40:42,600
Oh, welcome back everybody.

3359
03:40:43,100 --> 03:40:45,420
I guess we haven't gone to this area over here.

3360
03:40:47,020 --> 03:40:49,560
Not sure how to get there quite yet.

3361
03:40:50,600 --> 03:40:51,560
Hey dogs!

3362
03:40:52,060 --> 03:40:52,740
Do something!

3363
03:40:53,340 --> 03:40:54,240
You want the ball?

3364
03:40:54,420 --> 03:40:54,920
Get the ball.

3365
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:55,980
Get the ball.

3366
03:40:56,380 --> 03:40:57,060
You want the ball?

3367
03:40:57,220 --> 03:40:57,740
Get the ball.

3368
03:40:58,280 --> 03:40:58,780
Get the ball.

3369
03:40:59,120 --> 03:40:59,740
Get the ball!

3370
03:41:01,540 --> 03:41:02,400
Get the ball!

3371
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:03,580
Get the ball!

3372
03:41:03,920 --> 03:41:04,560
Get the ball!

3373
03:41:06,160 --> 03:41:08,040
These dogs suck.

3374
03:41:12,900 --> 03:41:15,440
No real prize for the bots we found along the way.

3375
03:41:16,380 --> 03:41:17,880
Yeah, I suppose so, huh?

3376
03:41:21,560 --> 03:41:23,160
The dogs don't do anything.

3377
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,600
Okay, so we still need to go in there.

3378
03:41:37,540 --> 03:41:39,080
I think I've gotten everything here.

3379
03:41:39,160 --> 03:41:40,120
Oh wait, maybe not.

3380
03:41:42,380 --> 03:41:44,620
Oh, this is the thing we're trying to fix.

3381
03:41:47,080 --> 03:41:47,600
Interesting.

3382
03:41:48,760 --> 03:41:51,500
Alright, let's go look in the other areas real quick just in case.

3383
03:41:52,020 --> 03:41:52,860
And then we'll go back.

3384
03:41:56,770 --> 03:41:58,090
25 guys, please!

3385
03:42:00,250 --> 03:42:00,850
Up dog.

3386
03:42:01,250 --> 03:42:01,970
What's up dog?

3387
03:42:03,590 --> 03:42:04,510
Gray fox!

3388
03:42:04,890 --> 03:42:05,890
Gray fox, you came!

3389
03:42:06,130 --> 03:42:07,350
Psycho mantis, you came!

3390
03:42:07,650 --> 03:42:08,890
Who am I walking on here?

3391
03:42:10,930 --> 03:42:11,530
Raiden!

3392
03:42:11,930 --> 03:42:12,270
Wait!

3393
03:42:12,570 --> 03:42:13,890
Raiden and...

3394
03:42:15,830 --> 03:42:17,030
And...and...the boss.

3395
03:42:17,530 --> 03:42:18,430
Oh my gosh!

3396
03:42:18,450 --> 03:42:19,230
Everybody is here!

3397
03:42:20,010 --> 03:42:20,630
Hi Snake!

3398
03:42:20,910 --> 03:42:21,770
Hi Ace Combat!

3399
03:42:24,090 --> 03:42:25,030
Hi Dante!

3400
03:42:27,350 --> 03:42:28,530
Everybody is here.

3401
03:42:28,830 --> 03:42:30,070
All the goats are here.

3402
03:42:32,910 --> 03:42:34,830
Wait, there is a puzzle piece I haven't gotten.

3403
03:42:35,190 --> 03:42:35,790
You guys!

3404
03:42:37,190 --> 03:42:39,010
I did need to come back here.

3405
03:42:40,010 --> 03:42:41,790
We needed a hundred guys!

3406
03:42:45,010 --> 03:42:46,950
We did have to come back here.

3407
03:42:48,970 --> 03:42:50,350
Give my back!

3408
03:42:51,570 --> 03:42:52,650
We need three more.

3409
03:42:52,790 --> 03:42:53,250
Hurry up!

3410
03:42:53,870 --> 03:42:54,730
We need one more.

3411
03:42:55,330 --> 03:42:56,650
Who is not pulling their weight?

3412
03:42:59,510 --> 03:42:59,970
Nice.

3413
03:43:08,560 --> 03:43:09,120
Hey!

3414
03:43:11,860 --> 03:43:12,920
One guy.

3415
03:43:17,700 --> 03:43:18,940
Dante is so happy.

3416
03:43:19,260 --> 03:43:19,820
Sorry.

3417
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:22,260
I didn't mean to shove him that far.

3418
03:43:24,740 --> 03:43:25,300
OK.

3419
03:43:27,620 --> 03:43:29,020
Let's go check the other area too.

3420
03:43:34,770 --> 03:43:35,870
This one over here.

3421
03:43:54,020 --> 03:43:55,000
Oh Raiden!

3422
03:43:57,340 --> 03:43:59,800
Wait, we haven't gotten Raiden's thing yet.

3423
03:44:00,020 --> 03:44:00,800
I just realized.

3424
03:44:04,640 --> 03:44:07,020
Stream until...Oh these are all normal guys.

3425
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:07,660
It's kind of weird.

3426
03:44:08,300 --> 03:44:11,540
Stream until we get Raiden's item.

3427
03:44:13,340 --> 03:44:14,420
Have we gotten everything here?

3428
03:44:15,160 --> 03:44:16,060
Maybe we have.

3429
03:44:16,060 --> 03:44:16,980
I don't know.

3430
03:44:20,260 --> 03:44:23,080
I think we got stuff down there.

3431
03:44:23,160 --> 03:44:24,180
I remember down there.

3432
03:44:27,700 --> 03:44:29,920
Did we really get everything in here?

3433
03:44:37,300 --> 03:44:38,560
Seems like it.

3434
03:44:40,840 --> 03:44:42,140
Excuse me!

3435
03:44:48,780 --> 03:44:51,680
They are alive

3436
03:44:59,380 --> 03:45:00,140
still, right?

3437
03:45:00,980 --> 03:45:02,020
They made it, right?

3438
03:45:06,180 --> 03:45:07,160
Oh god!

3439
03:45:07,480 --> 03:45:09,440
I'm home now and saw...

3440
03:45:09,440 --> 03:45:12,640
I saw Idol Lives for the first time in Japan.

3441
03:45:12,760 --> 03:45:13,280
Yosugawa.

3442
03:45:13,800 --> 03:45:16,040
I got a Cheki with Chia and I get it now.

3443
03:45:16,140 --> 03:45:16,400
Yeah!

3444
03:45:18,940 --> 03:45:20,960
Welcome to the Idol Brain Rott.

3445
03:45:21,280 --> 03:45:22,680
Seymour, also welcome home!

3446
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:24,880
Things were on.

3447
03:45:24,940 --> 03:45:28,180
Now I feel even more bad that you went and got the...

3448
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:31,180
got the...the card...

3449
03:45:31,920 --> 03:45:33,580
while you were on your last day.

3450
03:45:35,260 --> 03:45:36,220
I'm sorry.

3451
03:45:41,140 --> 03:45:43,700
Oh my gosh, we almost...should we...

3452
03:45:46,340 --> 03:45:50,660
I really don't feel like searching for him, but it's a special character.

3453
03:45:50,780 --> 03:45:51,880
It's not a normie guy.

3454
03:45:55,280 --> 03:45:56,480
What do you guys think?

3455
03:45:57,380 --> 03:45:58,680
The guy is easy to find?

3456
03:45:59,380 --> 03:45:59,940
He is?

3457
03:46:00,020 --> 03:46:00,760
OK, I'm gonna...

3458
03:46:00,760 --> 03:46:01,020
Wait!

3459
03:46:01,240 --> 03:46:02,720
We can pay money, can't we?

3460
03:46:02,720 --> 03:46:03,580
To get the bird.

3461
03:46:08,360 --> 03:46:10,020
Do you think it's near the star?

3462
03:46:11,100 --> 03:46:13,320
Oh, I don't have enough money for the bird.

3463
03:46:14,740 --> 03:46:16,160
That's so pathetic.

3464
03:46:17,660 --> 03:46:19,000
Give me money, please.

3465
03:46:19,100 --> 03:46:19,520
Thank you.

3466
03:46:26,740 --> 03:46:27,780
The warp?

3467
03:46:27,900 --> 03:46:28,700
We are...

3468
03:46:31,560 --> 03:46:32,080
Alright.

3469
03:46:36,940 --> 03:46:37,720
There we go.

3470
03:46:41,010 --> 03:46:42,390
Towards the beginning, huh?

3471
03:46:47,510 --> 03:46:49,190
Towards the beginning...

3472
03:46:50,190 --> 03:46:50,590
Maybe?

3473
03:46:52,970 --> 03:46:54,190
If we can get the warp...

3474
03:46:55,050 --> 03:46:57,850
Oh wait, I think the warp was at the very end, was it not?

3475
03:46:58,530 --> 03:47:01,370
Cause I saw...remember there was the...

3476
03:47:02,230 --> 03:47:04,310
If you saw it, there was like a little guy...

3477
03:47:04,990 --> 03:47:08,490
with a handle on him at the very, very end.

3478
03:47:12,190 --> 03:47:14,190
So I wonder...

3479
03:47:19,090 --> 03:47:20,170
Leave me alone.

3480
03:47:33,740 --> 03:47:35,380
Warp is near the start as well?

3481
03:47:35,440 --> 03:47:36,000
No way!

3482
03:47:36,860 --> 03:47:37,420
Huh?

3483
03:47:37,980 --> 03:47:40,160
Wait, so what was that guy I saw at the end then?

3484
03:47:41,980 --> 03:47:42,540
Alright.

3485
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:46,440
OK, I'm trusting you guys.

3486
03:47:48,260 --> 03:47:49,880
I'm trusting you guys.

3487
03:47:54,820 --> 03:47:56,480
Near the start...

3488
03:48:02,250 --> 03:48:03,330
Come here.

3489
03:48:06,050 --> 03:48:07,090
Now look around.

3490
03:48:07,270 --> 03:48:07,490
OK.

3491
03:48:08,270 --> 03:48:09,090
Where am I?

3492
03:48:09,930 --> 03:48:11,510
Guy is near the brother.

3493
03:48:13,470 --> 03:48:14,990
Near brother...OK.

3494
03:48:15,850 --> 03:48:16,750
Looking around.

3495
03:48:17,410 --> 03:48:18,510
Looking over the edges.

3496
03:48:20,470 --> 03:48:22,530
Grabbing money while on the way around.

3497
03:48:23,310 --> 03:48:24,730
Looking over the edges.

3498
03:48:25,450 --> 03:48:26,330
Near brother.

3499
03:48:29,050 --> 03:48:30,710
Oh my god!

3500
03:48:30,810 --> 03:48:31,890
On top of his head!

3501
03:48:32,270 --> 03:48:32,750
Brother!

3502
03:48:33,350 --> 03:48:34,770
You couldn't tell me this!

3503
03:48:36,090 --> 03:48:37,250
Oh my gosh!

3504
03:48:37,330 --> 03:48:40,630
Is this a little granola?

3505
03:48:43,590 --> 03:48:44,310
Yay!

3506
03:48:48,790 --> 03:48:49,610
Alright.

3507
03:48:50,870 --> 03:48:52,570
Now where is the warp?

3508
03:48:56,690 --> 03:48:57,530
Granola?

3509
03:49:01,270 --> 03:49:02,430
Oh, whoops.

3510
03:49:04,730 --> 03:49:06,510
One, two, three!

3511
03:49:15,270 --> 03:49:16,790
Where's the warp?

3512
03:49:22,530 --> 03:49:23,370
Andrigos!

3513
03:49:23,750 --> 03:49:24,830
Thanks for the 20 gifts!

3514
03:49:25,370 --> 03:49:26,370
Thank you!

3515
03:49:27,010 --> 03:49:28,210
Thanks so much!

3516
03:49:30,110 --> 03:49:31,610
Check brother again?

3517
03:49:33,110 --> 03:49:33,430
Brother!

3518
03:49:37,550 --> 03:49:38,250
Are you still here?

3519
03:49:39,830 --> 03:49:40,890
Brother, come back!

3520
03:49:54,220 --> 03:49:56,240
Maybe if I deflate this, he'll be like...

3521
03:49:56,240 --> 03:49:57,320
What are you doing, idiot?

3522
03:49:58,160 --> 03:49:58,560
Brother!

3523
03:50:02,060 --> 03:50:02,920
Can I restore?

3524
03:50:02,980 --> 03:50:03,700
OK, let's restore.

3525
03:50:08,260 --> 03:50:09,540
He dipped out.

3526
03:50:09,620 --> 03:50:10,160
For real!

3527
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:12,300
I got all those.

3528
03:50:12,400 --> 03:50:14,240
I still got to keep all the...

3529
03:50:14,240 --> 03:50:16,540
I didn't get to...Oh wait, unless...No.

3530
03:50:17,440 --> 03:50:20,360
I think I still got to keep all the money.

3531
03:50:20,360 --> 03:50:21,360
I think so.

3532
03:50:22,960 --> 03:50:24,700
I think I still got to keep all the money.

3533
03:50:26,960 --> 03:50:28,060
I think.

3534
03:50:29,360 --> 03:50:30,040
I think.

3535
03:50:30,940 --> 03:50:33,300
Fly over to the bamboo pot.

3536
03:50:34,180 --> 03:50:35,400
Bamboo pot.

3537
03:50:37,900 --> 03:50:40,460
You keep the money.

3538
03:50:43,000 --> 03:50:44,960
You keep the money.

3539
03:50:50,600 --> 03:50:52,120
You keep the money.

3540
03:50:53,420 --> 03:50:54,040
Asuka.

3541
03:50:54,820 --> 03:50:55,960
You keep the money.

3542
03:50:57,340 --> 03:50:57,960
Asuka.

3543
03:50:59,300 --> 03:50:59,760
Alright, brother!

3544
03:51:05,160 --> 03:51:07,020
Brother, I'm counting on you, brother!

3545
03:51:07,920 --> 03:51:08,540
Brother!

3546
03:51:10,580 --> 03:51:11,200
Brother.

3547
03:51:19,200 --> 03:51:19,820
OK.

3548
03:51:21,560 --> 03:51:22,900
Brother, don't leave yet.

3549
03:51:23,160 --> 03:51:24,760
Brother, brother, brother, brother.

3550
03:51:24,760 --> 03:51:26,320
Don't leave yet, brother.

3551
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:27,540
Brother.

3552
03:51:28,490 --> 03:51:31,000
Brother, I've always wanted a brother.

3553
03:51:31,740 --> 03:51:32,520
I'm sorry.

3554
03:51:33,380 --> 03:51:34,360
I'm sorry.

3555
03:51:34,640 --> 03:51:36,260
I'm so annoying about...

3556
03:51:36,260 --> 03:51:37,080
No, no, no, no.

3557
03:51:38,720 --> 03:51:41,480
Alright, brother.

3558
03:51:41,940 --> 03:51:42,880
I'm checking you out.

3559
03:51:45,280 --> 03:51:46,200
Alright, brother.

3560
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:48,440
What do you got going on?

3561
03:51:48,900 --> 03:51:52,800
Oh, you were holding out on us.

3562
03:51:52,800 --> 03:51:53,680
Brother!

3563
03:51:57,540 --> 03:52:00,540
It's not that over there, is it?

3564
03:52:03,700 --> 03:52:06,500
It's not that all the way over there, is it?

3565
03:52:16,070 --> 03:52:17,510
Brother, I need you to...

3566
03:52:21,110 --> 03:52:22,030
Check it out.

3567
03:52:30,300 --> 03:52:31,660
Here we go.

3568
03:52:44,660 --> 03:52:46,120
I don't get enough air.

3569
03:52:48,380 --> 03:52:49,780
I don't get enough air.

3570
03:52:54,320 --> 03:52:56,380
How many secrets was he hiding?

3571
03:52:56,960 --> 03:53:00,960
He literally... We kind of just robbed him, but...

3572
03:53:01,900 --> 03:53:02,960
Oh, the ladybug!

3573
03:53:03,960 --> 03:53:05,060
The bounce of the bug.

3574
03:53:06,080 --> 03:53:07,080
Thanks for the superchat!

3575
03:53:21,520 --> 03:53:24,960
Are we just gonna ignore how Minto just swatted that little shit out of the sky?

3576
03:53:24,960 --> 03:53:25,900
Oh,

3577
03:53:29,680 --> 03:53:30,400
oh my goodness.

3578
03:53:30,920 --> 03:53:31,760
Chill out.

3579
03:53:31,980 --> 03:53:32,180
Chill out.

3580
03:53:32,440 --> 03:53:32,920
Chill out.

3581
03:53:33,620 --> 03:53:34,460
Chill out.

3582
03:53:36,380 --> 03:53:39,180
We were so... Wait, I think I need to get closer.

3583
03:53:42,180 --> 03:53:44,080
Okay, maybe like that.

3584
03:53:45,440 --> 03:53:46,000
Yes!

3585
03:53:46,000 --> 03:53:46,200
Yes!

3586
03:53:56,260 --> 03:53:57,500
We did it everybody!

3587
03:53:58,220 --> 03:53:59,320
Someone said bamboo.

3588
03:53:59,820 --> 03:54:01,500
I was like, I don't think I've seen a bamboo.

3589
03:54:02,760 --> 03:54:05,080
I don't think I've seen a bamboo pot around here.

3590
03:54:06,020 --> 03:54:06,980
This is why.

3591
03:54:08,640 --> 03:54:11,480
Oh, I need to go...

3592
03:54:11,480 --> 03:54:11,700
Huh?

3593
03:54:11,940 --> 03:54:12,220
Oh.

3594
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:17,940
Oh, sorry.

3595
03:54:24,300 --> 03:54:25,880
I think we're good.

3596
03:54:26,420 --> 03:54:26,880
Oh no!

3597
03:54:32,340 --> 03:54:32,880
It's okay.

3598
03:54:33,000 --> 03:54:33,780
I have a cord.

3599
03:54:38,050 --> 03:54:38,710
It's all good.

3600
03:54:40,670 --> 03:54:42,850
Wow, I just charged this too.

3601
03:54:43,010 --> 03:54:43,670
That's kind of crazy.

3602
03:54:49,210 --> 03:54:50,450
Oh, this is fun.

3603
03:54:50,830 --> 03:54:51,990
I don't like...

3604
03:54:51,990 --> 03:54:52,950
Nice!

3605
03:54:52,950 --> 03:54:52,990
Nice!

3606
03:54:58,410 --> 03:54:59,010
Secret.

3607
03:55:02,530 --> 03:55:04,250
Yeah, this one was really good.

3608
03:55:04,850 --> 03:55:06,310
This one was kind of crazy.

3609
03:55:07,130 --> 03:55:08,190
Thanks for the help guys.

3610
03:55:11,030 --> 03:55:11,630
Controller!

3611
03:55:25,100 --> 03:55:25,700
Secret.

3612
03:55:26,560 --> 03:55:27,620
Danger dojo.

3613
03:55:28,840 --> 03:55:30,520
Do we want to go in right now?

3614
03:55:34,000 --> 03:55:36,020
I'm thinking maybe...

3615
03:55:36,020 --> 03:55:37,440
I want to beat the boss here.

3616
03:55:39,800 --> 03:55:41,560
Like maybe get this guy.

3617
03:55:42,200 --> 03:55:43,060
Beat this.

3618
03:55:44,100 --> 03:55:45,660
And then maybe...

3619
03:55:47,100 --> 03:55:48,300
Call it a day.

3620
03:55:48,580 --> 03:55:52,080
I really wanted to go long, but...

3621
03:55:52,080 --> 03:55:54,660
I took even some medicine, but...

3622
03:55:57,680 --> 03:56:00,640
Just since I'm feeling a little icky.

3623
03:56:06,560 --> 03:56:08,580
Oh no, not the square challenge.

3624
03:56:12,400 --> 03:56:13,120
Puzzle piece!

3625
03:56:14,800 --> 03:56:15,420
Got it.

3626
03:56:16,820 --> 03:56:18,220
You're no match for me.

3627
03:56:21,240 --> 03:56:22,200
Yes, sirree.

3628
03:56:26,360 --> 03:56:27,360
These ones though.

3629
03:56:27,840 --> 03:56:29,020
Are you going to turn into a thing?

3630
03:56:29,580 --> 03:56:30,100
Oh.

3631
03:56:32,120 --> 03:56:32,960
Not yet.

3632
03:56:36,500 --> 03:56:37,900
Just one guy here.

3633
03:56:39,280 --> 03:56:41,120
Let's dive on in to the boss.

3634
03:56:46,920 --> 03:56:48,640
It has already been four hours.

3635
03:56:48,680 --> 03:56:49,240
That's crazy.

3636
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:53,440
I lose track of so much time in this game because it's so much fun.

3637
03:56:54,940 --> 03:56:55,720
Go, go, go!

3638
03:57:01,820 --> 03:57:06,020
Can I aim on a single guy?

3639
03:57:08,200 --> 03:57:10,760
Can I even get a single guy?

3640
03:57:10,960 --> 03:57:11,600
Thank you.

3641
03:57:13,320 --> 03:57:15,120
So mysterious here.

3642
03:57:16,680 --> 03:57:18,620
The flowers are luminescent.

3643
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:29,280
Ok, we'll wait for this.

3644
03:57:31,800 --> 03:57:32,900
There we go.

3645
03:57:34,660 --> 03:57:36,020
Oh, it's a time stop again.

3646
03:57:38,760 --> 03:57:40,420
Look at his face.

3647
03:57:42,860 --> 03:57:44,380
Get got.

3648
03:57:45,540 --> 03:57:48,080
Get got, guys.

3649
03:57:48,360 --> 03:57:49,280
Get got.

3650
03:57:55,680 --> 03:57:57,720
Oh, wait.

3651
03:57:58,660 --> 03:57:59,300
Hold on.

3652
03:58:00,860 --> 03:58:03,600
Is this a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference?

3653
03:58:05,170 --> 03:58:06,020
Hold on.

3654
03:58:10,200 --> 03:58:12,720
Yeah, this is a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference.

3655
03:58:12,860 --> 03:58:15,080
They are the first to ever do time stuff, you know.

3656
03:58:18,160 --> 03:58:20,100
No, never done before.

3657
03:58:21,620 --> 03:58:24,820
Time stop, time slow has never been done before.

3658
03:58:25,260 --> 03:58:26,560
I feel so attacked.

3659
03:58:28,720 --> 03:58:29,260
Oh, wait.

3660
03:58:34,870 --> 03:58:36,630
Why can't I jump on top of that?

3661
03:58:36,690 --> 03:58:37,610
I want to light it up.

3662
03:58:39,490 --> 03:58:40,890
That's strange.

3663
03:58:42,030 --> 03:58:43,170
Oh my god!

3664
03:58:45,190 --> 03:58:46,930
Oh, is that a Toho reference?

3665
03:58:48,690 --> 03:58:49,570
Yes.

3666
03:58:50,510 --> 03:58:51,630
Toho Project.

3667
03:58:52,330 --> 03:58:53,870
Never been done before.

3668
03:58:58,190 --> 03:59:00,970
Let me check the sides.

3669
03:59:02,910 --> 03:59:04,210
Fangirl Castle!

3670
03:59:04,950 --> 03:59:06,190
Thank you so much.

3671
03:59:06,230 --> 03:59:06,970
Welcome to membership.

3672
03:59:09,170 --> 03:59:11,050
Let's take a little shower, you stanky.

3673
03:59:12,730 --> 03:59:13,750
Don't you feel better?

3674
03:59:14,010 --> 03:59:16,930
Don't you feel more refreshed after taking that shower?

3675
03:59:25,830 --> 03:59:26,430
Oh my god.

3676
03:59:26,590 --> 03:59:29,910
I almost went through it myself.

3677
03:59:33,920 --> 03:59:35,320
How do we light that one though?

3678
03:59:35,360 --> 03:59:36,320
I feel like it's a secret.

3679
03:59:41,650 --> 03:59:42,910
Doesn't it feel like a secret?

3680
03:59:42,910 --> 03:59:43,070
It's a secret.

3681
03:59:45,790 --> 03:59:47,990
Are there any...actually...

3682
03:59:47,990 --> 03:59:49,290
Oh, there's just a guy here.

3683
03:59:49,670 --> 03:59:50,630
Maybe not.

3684
03:59:55,620 --> 03:59:57,380
Maybe...like it feels like a secret, right?

3685
03:59:58,540 --> 04:00:01,080
No sickness will ever bring Lay Mintlow.

3686
04:00:02,500 --> 04:00:03,800
We will never relent.

3687
04:00:03,900 --> 04:00:04,720
We will never surrender.

3688
04:00:07,180 --> 04:00:07,720
Yes.

3689
04:00:09,000 --> 04:00:10,040
Thank you Barbies!

3690
04:00:15,120 --> 04:00:17,380
Bait the chameleon to shooting at it.

3691
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:19,820
I think it would just be coins though.

3692
04:00:20,660 --> 04:00:21,180
I think.

3693
04:00:21,300 --> 04:00:23,600
I think we get the guys from...

3694
04:00:23,600 --> 04:00:26,280
I think we get the guys from...

3695
04:00:33,640 --> 04:00:34,900
From the boss.

3696
04:00:35,580 --> 04:00:36,260
From fighting.

3697
04:00:37,760 --> 04:00:38,040
Uh oh.

3698
04:00:38,140 --> 04:00:38,820
There's our hearts.

3699
04:00:39,120 --> 04:00:39,480
Uh oh.

3700
04:00:40,680 --> 04:00:42,960
There's our...Oh, it's a giant chameleon!

3701
04:00:44,240 --> 04:00:45,400
Mecha Leon.

3702
04:00:51,720 --> 04:00:52,700
Oh gosh.

3703
04:00:54,840 --> 04:00:56,240
Oh my god.

3704
04:01:07,350 --> 04:01:08,410
Oh my gosh.

3705
04:01:11,130 --> 04:01:12,450
Oh, ouchie ouch.

3706
04:01:18,710 --> 04:01:21,630
I gotta go up and I gotta pull his tongue!

3707
04:01:27,980 --> 04:01:29,180
Oh, he's purple now.

3708
04:01:31,980 --> 04:01:32,860
What's going on?

3709
04:01:33,040 --> 04:01:33,540
What was that sound?

3710
04:01:39,440 --> 04:01:41,440
Oh, I think he's gonna shoot another...

3711
04:01:42,180 --> 04:01:42,580
Okay.

3712
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:44,260
Oh my god.

3713
04:01:47,720 --> 04:01:48,620
Okay, we made it.

3714
04:01:57,550 --> 04:01:58,530
Oh my god.

3715
04:01:58,590 --> 04:01:58,930
No!

3716
04:02:01,070 --> 04:02:01,470
No!

3717
04:02:03,430 --> 04:02:05,150
Oh, come on.

3718
04:02:05,170 --> 04:02:06,530
That was so...

3719
04:02:06,530 --> 04:02:07,970
That was so rude.

3720
04:02:11,250 --> 04:02:13,210
We gotta get rid of the chameleons first.

3721
04:02:18,050 --> 04:02:19,770
And I can't see these guys.

3722
04:02:23,410 --> 04:02:25,350
Did I really die?

3723
04:02:26,950 --> 04:02:29,510
Okay, it's fine.

3724
04:02:30,190 --> 04:02:30,830
It's fine.

3725
04:02:32,970 --> 04:02:33,910
It's fine.

3726
04:02:33,970 --> 04:02:34,210
Whatever.

3727
04:02:36,190 --> 04:02:36,590
Whatever.

3728
04:02:38,430 --> 04:02:39,170
Wait a second.

3729
04:02:39,370 --> 04:02:40,670
Three chameleons this time?

3730
04:02:41,070 --> 04:02:41,770
Excuse me?

3731
04:02:42,870 --> 04:02:44,130
Can I jump on his tongue?

3732
04:02:44,630 --> 04:02:45,090
Right here?

3733
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:46,890
No, I cannot.

3734
04:02:59,100 --> 04:02:59,860
Now I can.

3735
04:03:04,320 --> 04:03:06,400
Close, close, close.

3736
04:03:09,140 --> 04:03:09,860
Beat him up!

3737
04:03:10,040 --> 04:03:10,300
Beat him up!

3738
04:03:10,340 --> 04:03:10,740
Beat him up!

3739
04:03:10,760 --> 04:03:12,100
Beat him up!

3740
04:03:18,220 --> 04:03:21,160
Tall, but with...

3741
04:03:22,220 --> 04:03:24,420
But with slowdown would be awesome.

3742
04:03:26,060 --> 04:03:26,760
Oh my god.

3743
04:03:28,120 --> 04:03:29,040
Okay.

3744
04:03:30,120 --> 04:03:31,440
Now do it again!

3745
04:03:38,370 --> 04:03:41,330
It's actually a nice easy mode.

3746
04:03:42,490 --> 04:03:43,870
Oh my gosh.

3747
04:03:51,200 --> 04:03:51,870
Okay.

3748
04:03:52,710 --> 04:03:55,030
I can grab this guy at least.

3749
04:04:05,650 --> 04:04:06,430
Nice.

3750
04:04:07,730 --> 04:04:08,290
We're gaming?

3751
04:04:11,320 --> 04:04:12,270
We're gaming?

3752
04:04:14,510 --> 04:04:15,850
Wait.

3753
04:04:19,320 --> 04:04:20,000
Okay.

3754
04:04:24,930 --> 04:04:26,730
So unfair!

3755
04:04:27,090 --> 04:04:27,910
Dang it.

3756
04:04:38,900 --> 04:04:40,760
Almost there, I think.

3757
04:04:41,440 --> 04:04:42,420
Almost there, I think.

3758
04:04:49,510 --> 04:04:51,570
I don't know if I can get them.

3759
04:04:52,690 --> 04:04:52,890
Okay.

3760
04:04:59,780 --> 04:05:00,340
No!

3761
04:05:01,900 --> 04:05:02,960
No way!

3762
04:05:03,060 --> 04:05:03,660
Come on!

3763
04:05:08,510 --> 04:05:10,090
I have to be good here.

3764
04:05:10,570 --> 04:05:11,650
I have to just be good.

3765
04:05:12,330 --> 04:05:12,950
Oh my gosh.

3766
04:05:14,070 --> 04:05:14,890
Oh shit!

3767
04:05:15,050 --> 04:05:17,130
I didn't realize what he was doing.

3768
04:05:17,210 --> 04:05:18,770
I thought the things were gonna drop.

3769
04:05:19,350 --> 04:05:22,350
I thought the things were gonna drop to have the little enemies.

3770
04:05:26,950 --> 04:05:29,150
This is what I thought he was about to do.

3771
04:05:30,330 --> 04:05:30,570
Okay.

3772
04:05:31,970 --> 04:05:32,570
A one.

3773
04:05:33,670 --> 04:05:34,210
A two.

3774
04:05:34,690 --> 04:05:35,330
A three.

3775
04:05:35,650 --> 04:05:35,810
Okay.

3776
04:05:47,200 --> 04:05:48,440
Wait, let me restart.

3777
04:05:48,840 --> 04:05:50,400
Wait, will it restart the whole level?

3778
04:05:50,700 --> 04:05:51,340
Okay, nevermind.

3779
04:05:51,920 --> 04:05:52,100
Oh.

3780
04:05:52,300 --> 04:05:52,840
Oh goodness.

3781
04:05:53,520 --> 04:05:54,280
Run, run, run!

3782
04:05:55,500 --> 04:06:01,340
I wanted to get to at least second phase with no death or... Yeah.

3783
04:06:01,940 --> 04:06:03,200
With full lives, you know?

3784
04:06:04,960 --> 04:06:05,660
Oh well.

3785
04:06:05,860 --> 04:06:06,360
Oh well.

3786
04:06:06,600 --> 04:06:07,480
You got this.

3787
04:06:07,560 --> 04:06:08,440
Thank you!

3788
04:06:09,120 --> 04:06:10,080
Oh shit!

3789
04:06:11,500 --> 04:06:12,580
Oh my god.

3790
04:06:13,000 --> 04:06:14,300
I slowed down though!

3791
04:06:15,360 --> 04:06:16,180
I did.

3792
04:06:20,860 --> 04:06:22,280
I ruined the run.

3793
04:06:22,720 --> 04:06:23,860
I ruined the run, everybody.

3794
04:06:25,220 --> 04:06:26,680
I only have one life left.

3795
04:06:32,670 --> 04:06:33,150
Okay.

3796
04:06:33,790 --> 04:06:34,090
Okay.

3797
04:06:34,790 --> 04:06:35,490
Come on.

3798
04:06:35,610 --> 04:06:35,990
Come on.

3799
04:06:36,470 --> 04:06:37,430
We got this.

3800
04:06:37,510 --> 04:06:38,590
This guy is not so bad.

3801
04:06:38,830 --> 04:06:40,330
It's just me being silly, I think.

3802
04:06:44,430 --> 04:06:46,130
It's just my silliness.

3803
04:06:54,460 --> 04:06:54,980
Oh wait.

3804
04:06:55,300 --> 04:06:56,120
I'm gonna do this.

3805
04:06:56,760 --> 04:06:57,460
And then this.

3806
04:06:59,420 --> 04:07:00,040
Like that.

3807
04:07:00,160 --> 04:07:00,640
There we go.

3808
04:07:04,080 --> 04:07:05,060
Run, run, run!

3809
04:07:05,720 --> 04:07:06,820
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit!

3810
04:07:06,860 --> 04:07:08,020
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch, punch!

3811
04:07:12,700 --> 04:07:13,020
Alright.

3812
04:07:20,470 --> 04:07:21,910
Alright, I'm gonna go on the second time.

3813
04:07:23,090 --> 04:07:25,050
There, there, there, there, there.

3814
04:07:25,190 --> 04:07:25,910
Go.

3815
04:07:27,830 --> 04:07:28,390
Two.

3816
04:07:29,030 --> 04:07:29,550
Three.

3817
04:07:30,550 --> 04:07:31,790
And we're here.

3818
04:07:33,210 --> 04:07:33,970
Alright.

3819
04:07:39,120 --> 04:07:42,180
I don't know actually how I'm dodging this.

3820
04:07:44,780 --> 04:07:45,300
Okay.

3821
04:07:47,040 --> 04:07:48,800
Somehow, we did it.

3822
04:07:52,250 --> 04:07:53,970
We can take out this guy.

3823
04:07:55,650 --> 04:07:56,870
Let more guys drop.

3824
04:07:57,570 --> 04:07:58,430
Take out this guy.

3825
04:07:58,870 --> 04:07:59,910
Take out this guy.

3826
04:08:00,450 --> 04:08:01,530
Take out this guy.

3827
04:08:02,150 --> 04:08:03,630
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

3828
04:08:03,790 --> 04:08:04,830
Take out this guy!

3829
04:08:05,290 --> 04:08:05,770
Got him.

3830
04:08:09,850 --> 04:08:14,470
I don't exactly know how to dodge this thing, but...

3831
04:08:14,470 --> 04:08:17,030
I just kind of run in circles until...

3832
04:08:17,030 --> 04:08:17,610
Oh gosh, wait.

3833
04:08:19,390 --> 04:08:21,430
I think I ran right into it.

3834
04:08:22,130 --> 04:08:23,090
That's my bad.

3835
04:08:25,390 --> 04:08:29,330
I think I... I think I ran around so much that I ran right into it.

3836
04:08:31,430 --> 04:08:31,870
Bottom.

3837
04:08:33,230 --> 04:08:33,950
Right here.

3838
04:08:42,400 --> 04:08:46,820
Oh, I think I got hit, so I wasn't able to see the whole thing.

3839
04:08:49,360 --> 04:08:51,000
You're slowing too early on the missiles.

3840
04:08:51,220 --> 04:08:52,780
Oh, I think that's probably it, huh?

3841
04:08:57,390 --> 04:08:58,350
Aiya!

3842
04:09:00,310 --> 04:09:03,270
Okay, don't fall here.

3843
04:09:04,470 --> 04:09:05,130
Okay.

3844
04:09:15,300 --> 04:09:19,740
Okay, now here he's going to do the missiles.

3845
04:09:20,500 --> 04:09:22,500
Okay, on that side.

3846
04:09:25,060 --> 04:09:26,340
Oh my goodness.

3847
04:09:27,120 --> 04:09:28,880
Can I walk under here?

3848
04:09:29,380 --> 04:09:29,700
Okay.

3849
04:09:32,020 --> 04:09:32,820
And...

3850
04:09:32,820 --> 04:09:35,160
Oh shoot.

3851
04:09:36,760 --> 04:09:37,920
Oh no!

3852
04:09:40,830 --> 04:09:42,030
What's going on?

3853
04:09:42,450 --> 04:09:43,070
What are you doing?

3854
04:09:52,300 --> 04:09:53,880
I didn't see him.

3855
04:10:01,040 --> 04:10:01,920
Oh my...

3856
04:10:28,650 --> 04:10:29,530
He cheated?

3857
04:10:29,830 --> 04:10:30,030
Yeah.

3858
04:10:30,330 --> 04:10:31,290
You're getting closer now.

3859
04:10:31,370 --> 04:10:35,890
Yeah, I think that's the last part, so we just gotta... just gotta get it, you know?

3860
04:10:35,890 --> 04:10:35,950
Oh no.

3861
04:10:40,710 --> 04:10:46,500
That was so close.

3862
04:10:50,860 --> 04:10:52,900
Is that about the timing, maybe?

3863
04:10:53,760 --> 04:10:54,820
Yeah, I think so.

3864
04:10:55,320 --> 04:10:55,740
Oh, whoops.

3865
04:10:56,040 --> 04:11:00,000
We have

3866
04:11:03,960 --> 04:11:08,060
to have them, like, hold on me, and then I...

3867
04:11:08,060 --> 04:11:09,560
This guy's, like, right on the edge.

3868
04:11:12,360 --> 04:11:12,900
Okay.

3869
04:11:14,520 --> 04:11:17,600
I have to have them hold on me, and then I can do it.

3870
04:11:20,780 --> 04:11:21,980
And then I can run.

3871
04:11:22,640 --> 04:11:23,780
Yeah, like that, I think.

3872
04:11:24,140 --> 04:11:25,300
Oh my gosh!

3873
04:11:25,820 --> 04:11:27,440
That was way too close!

3874
04:11:29,240 --> 04:11:32,060
That was way too close!

3875
04:11:35,440 --> 04:11:35,980
Okay.

3876
04:11:36,760 --> 04:11:38,440
Easy does it, easy does it.

3877
04:11:39,960 --> 04:11:40,840
There we go.

3878
04:11:41,860 --> 04:11:42,480
Okay.

3879
04:11:58,900 --> 04:12:00,000
Nice, nice, nice.

3880
04:12:10,560 --> 04:12:11,180
Okay.

3881
04:12:11,920 --> 04:12:12,520
Alright.

3882
04:12:17,320 --> 04:12:19,100
That one felt close.

3883
04:12:21,100 --> 04:12:21,720
Alright.

3884
04:12:22,300 --> 04:12:24,400
Now we know he's gonna do it all on that side.

3885
04:12:24,900 --> 04:12:25,580
Oh, nevermind!

3886
04:12:26,500 --> 04:12:27,120
What?

3887
04:12:27,220 --> 04:12:28,280
That still got me?

3888
04:12:28,360 --> 04:12:29,080
No way!

3889
04:12:30,800 --> 04:12:31,780
No way!

3890
04:12:32,240 --> 04:12:33,000
That's so rude!

3891
04:12:35,080 --> 04:12:38,200
I guess it's whatever side I'm on.

3892
04:12:39,480 --> 04:12:40,360
Ultra!

3893
04:12:46,530 --> 04:12:47,150
Come on!

3894
04:12:47,690 --> 04:12:50,410
This guy sucks so much!

3895
04:12:51,070 --> 04:12:53,530
This guy sucks so much!

3896
04:13:00,650 --> 04:13:02,510
Is this... Is there any other guys?

3897
04:13:03,670 --> 04:13:04,690
I can't tell.

3898
04:13:16,800 --> 04:13:18,080
This might be it.

3899
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:22,400
Ultra!

3900
04:13:23,140 --> 04:13:23,860
Oh,

3901
04:13:33,280 --> 04:13:34,460
there we go.

3902
04:13:38,720 --> 04:13:40,740
What am I doing with him?

3903
04:13:42,260 --> 04:13:43,780
What am I doing with him?

3904
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:50,740
Nice.

3905
04:13:51,020 --> 04:13:51,820
That one hurt.

3906
04:13:52,240 --> 04:13:53,240
That was really brutal.

3907
04:14:01,780 --> 04:14:03,220
We got...

3908
04:14:19,860 --> 04:14:21,800
We have a literal bean.

3909
04:14:22,740 --> 04:14:23,880
Bye-bye!

3910
04:14:25,260 --> 04:14:26,020
What?

3911
04:14:26,260 --> 04:14:27,640
I'm playing soccer with the bean.

3912
04:14:30,300 --> 04:14:31,500
Bye-bye!

3913
04:14:32,860 --> 04:14:33,900
Bye-bye!

3914
04:14:40,320 --> 04:14:41,500
Bye-bye!

3915
04:14:46,230 --> 04:14:46,990
Nice.

3916
04:14:47,330 --> 04:14:47,750
What is it?

3917
04:14:47,770 --> 04:14:48,450
Loco-roco?

3918
04:14:51,310 --> 04:14:52,490
Loco-roco.

3919
04:14:53,650 --> 04:14:55,270
I think I've heard of it before.

3920
04:14:56,830 --> 04:15:01,370
We go to the loco-roco-loco-moco-loco world.

3921
04:15:05,380 --> 04:15:09,640
Now that is what you get with a grit as iron as yours.

3922
04:15:09,780 --> 04:15:10,300
Thank you.

3923
04:15:11,180 --> 04:15:12,140
Look at that.

3924
04:15:12,240 --> 04:15:14,060
We have 100% in all these worlds even.

3925
04:15:15,420 --> 04:15:17,280
Loco-roco world.

3926
04:15:18,100 --> 04:15:19,200
Going loco.

3927
04:15:20,800 --> 04:15:21,800
Let's do it.

3928
04:15:22,380 --> 04:15:23,780
Let's beat this galaxy.

3929
04:15:25,120 --> 04:15:27,940
You will feel joy from this place.

3930
04:15:29,740 --> 04:15:31,940
I already feel good.

3931
04:15:32,660 --> 04:15:33,640
I hope he doesn't get kidnapped.

3932
04:15:34,760 --> 04:15:35,920
You stay right there mister.

3933
04:15:42,710 --> 04:15:44,070
We are connected.

3934
04:15:45,330 --> 04:15:49,410
We are connected by our strings.

3935
04:15:53,420 --> 04:15:55,340
I became one!

3936
04:15:56,640 --> 04:15:58,120
We fused!

3937
04:15:59,160 --> 04:16:00,660
I have to tilt it?

3938
04:16:00,740 --> 04:16:01,760
Oh my god, no way.

3939
04:16:14,770 --> 04:16:15,890
Come on!

3940
04:16:16,710 --> 04:16:17,330
There we go.

3941
04:16:21,090 --> 04:16:22,210
Goodness gracious.

3942
04:16:26,010 --> 04:16:28,210
Oh my gosh, it's a heart!

3943
04:16:32,130 --> 04:16:33,630
The music is too cute.

3944
04:16:36,450 --> 04:16:37,710
OK, we made it.

3945
04:16:38,070 --> 04:16:39,210
Is there anything in the tree?

3946
04:16:39,490 --> 04:16:40,390
I guess we'll never know.

3947
04:16:43,730 --> 04:16:45,710
Watch out for the spikies!

3948
04:16:51,010 --> 04:16:51,870
Grab him!

3949
04:16:53,110 --> 04:16:54,690
What the hell is happening?

3950
04:16:56,890 --> 04:16:57,930
Speedy blob.

3951
04:16:58,290 --> 04:16:58,890
Can he sing?

3952
04:16:59,570 --> 04:17:00,470
Yes he can.

3953
04:17:00,590 --> 04:17:01,070
Tante!

3954
04:17:06,010 --> 04:17:06,330
Money.

3955
04:17:10,690 --> 04:17:11,330
Squeeze!

3956
04:17:12,050 --> 04:17:12,810
Oh no!

3957
04:17:19,780 --> 04:17:20,740
Hold on.

3958
04:17:21,160 --> 04:17:22,440
We will squeeze in here.

3959
04:17:23,720 --> 04:17:24,360
Everybody!

3960
04:17:24,860 --> 04:17:24,860
Everybody!

3961
04:17:24,860 --> 04:17:25,120
Everybody!

3962
04:17:25,520 --> 04:17:25,980
Everybody!

3963
04:17:26,260 --> 04:17:26,420
Everybody!

3964
04:17:26,740 --> 04:17:27,160
There we go.

3965
04:17:28,260 --> 04:17:28,680
Together!

3966
04:17:28,860 --> 04:17:29,040
Together!

3967
04:17:29,180 --> 04:17:29,300
Together!

3968
04:17:29,760 --> 04:17:30,200
Back together!

3969
04:17:30,320 --> 04:17:30,560
Back together!

3970
04:17:31,620 --> 04:17:32,260
Nice!

3971
04:17:33,860 --> 04:17:34,500
OK.

3972
04:17:34,940 --> 04:17:35,840
Back together!

3973
04:17:35,940 --> 04:17:36,280
Back together!

3974
04:17:40,670 --> 04:17:41,110
Oh my goodness.

3975
04:17:49,150 --> 04:17:50,010
I missed him.

3976
04:17:50,090 --> 04:17:50,470
I missed him.

3977
04:17:50,510 --> 04:17:50,770
Hold on.

3978
04:17:51,930 --> 04:17:53,230
Is there anything in the trees?

3979
04:18:01,850 --> 04:18:02,570
I'm speeding.

3980
04:18:02,710 --> 04:18:03,090
I'm speeding.

3981
04:18:03,230 --> 04:18:03,450
I'm speeding.

3982
04:18:04,870 --> 04:18:05,230
Nice.

3983
04:18:06,030 --> 04:18:06,830
Nice, nice, nice.

3984
04:18:15,850 --> 04:18:16,210
Money!

3985
04:18:17,330 --> 04:18:18,650
Oh my gosh.

3986
04:18:18,970 --> 04:18:20,070
Oh my god.

3987
04:18:20,650 --> 04:18:21,130
Wait!

3988
04:18:21,390 --> 04:18:21,870
Money!

3989
04:18:22,290 --> 04:18:22,770
Money!

3990
04:18:24,390 --> 04:18:25,550
OK, I got it.

3991
04:18:29,770 --> 04:18:31,070
How do I get up there?

3992
04:18:36,450 --> 04:18:37,750
How do I get up there?

3993
04:18:38,490 --> 04:18:39,610
I did it!

3994
04:18:43,230 --> 04:18:44,370
Exuberant blob.

3995
04:18:44,770 --> 04:18:46,250
The big fan of rigor.

3996
04:19:01,880 --> 04:19:08,760
I feel like this game, this one in particular, this level in particular is bringing out my inner child.

3997
04:19:09,920 --> 04:19:10,880
Stylish blob.

3998
04:19:11,100 --> 04:19:13,320
Her voice has a certain je ne sais quoi.

3999
04:19:15,000 --> 04:19:15,680
What does it mean?

4000
04:19:17,020 --> 04:19:17,340
What the?

4001
04:19:17,720 --> 04:19:18,460
Hold on.

4002
04:19:21,160 --> 04:19:21,840
Hold on.

4003
04:19:22,640 --> 04:19:23,840
I can't get the money!

4004
04:19:24,900 --> 04:19:25,560
One more.

4005
04:19:25,740 --> 04:19:25,880
One more.

4006
04:19:26,080 --> 04:19:26,240
One more.

4007
04:19:27,760 --> 04:19:28,400
Hold on.

4008
04:19:28,480 --> 04:19:28,700
I'll wait.

4009
04:19:29,640 --> 04:19:30,600
Launch me!

4010
04:19:37,010 --> 04:19:38,090
Oh my gosh.

4011
04:19:38,290 --> 04:19:40,090
We almost did not make that you guys.

4012
04:19:43,470 --> 04:19:44,450
Grab that money.

4013
04:20:01,300 --> 04:20:01,820
Everybody...

4014
04:20:01,820 --> 04:20:02,940
I see him over there.

4015
04:20:03,520 --> 04:20:03,960
Watch out.

4016
04:20:04,040 --> 04:20:04,360
Watch out.

4017
04:20:09,600 --> 04:20:11,700
We got the voracious blob.

4018
04:20:11,820 --> 04:20:12,460
Deep voice.

4019
04:20:12,640 --> 04:20:13,380
Bottomless stomach.

4020
04:20:19,810 --> 04:20:20,730
I got it.

4021
04:20:21,090 --> 04:20:21,830
Give me a second.

4022
04:20:23,070 --> 04:20:24,370
Is this how this game plays?

4023
04:20:28,670 --> 04:20:29,570
Give me this.

4024
04:20:31,610 --> 04:20:32,490
I see another one.

4025
04:20:32,950 --> 04:20:33,390
Hold on.

4026
04:20:33,530 --> 04:20:34,890
Stop playing.

4027
04:20:35,530 --> 04:20:36,570
Bumper with me.

4028
04:20:37,130 --> 04:20:37,490
Oh my god.

4029
04:20:38,530 --> 04:20:39,050
Please.

4030
04:20:39,270 --> 04:20:39,610
There we go.

4031
04:20:41,510 --> 04:20:42,430
Stop playing.

4032
04:20:44,130 --> 04:20:44,710
Oh my god.

4033
04:20:45,670 --> 04:20:47,970
I just want to get this tree over here.

4034
04:20:51,810 --> 04:20:52,330
Please!

4035
04:20:52,330 --> 04:20:52,730
Please!

4036
04:20:56,090 --> 04:20:57,530
It didn't do anything.

4037
04:20:59,350 --> 04:21:00,990
Do I need to roll into this?

4038
04:21:03,630 --> 04:21:04,030
OK.

4039
04:21:04,150 --> 04:21:04,590
Hold on.

4040
04:21:05,210 --> 04:21:06,390
Do I bounce into it?

4041
04:21:11,590 --> 04:21:14,030
I can't tell what I'm supposed to do here.

4042
04:21:22,920 --> 04:21:24,340
I'm supposed to be small.

4043
04:21:24,640 --> 04:21:24,940
Duh.

4044
04:21:25,460 --> 04:21:26,180
I just realized.

4045
04:21:27,900 --> 04:21:29,060
Get the money everybody.

4046
04:21:29,140 --> 04:21:29,560
Get the money.

4047
04:21:29,820 --> 04:21:30,940
Everybody grab a dollar.

4048
04:21:31,280 --> 04:21:32,040
Everybody grab a coin.

4049
04:21:32,340 --> 04:21:32,740
Oh my god.

4050
04:21:34,000 --> 04:21:34,480
Wait.

4051
04:21:34,700 --> 04:21:35,380
There is one more.

4052
04:21:48,660 --> 04:21:49,620
Thank you.

4053
04:21:52,630 --> 04:21:53,870
A funky force of nature.

4054
04:21:53,990 --> 04:21:54,290
Oh my god.

4055
04:21:54,310 --> 04:21:56,990
As we were standing here we got all the money too.

4056
04:21:57,070 --> 04:21:57,590
That's amazing.

4057
04:22:02,030 --> 04:22:02,510
Money.

4058
04:22:03,390 --> 04:22:03,710
Money.

4059
04:22:04,690 --> 04:22:05,170
Nice.

4060
04:22:05,470 --> 04:22:05,470
Nice.

4061
04:22:06,420 --> 04:22:06,830
Money.

4062
04:22:07,890 --> 04:22:09,250
We missed one.

4063
04:22:09,650 --> 04:22:10,250
So close.

4064
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:17,630
That was so fun!

4065
04:22:18,950 --> 04:22:20,410
Mothership's cooling fan.

4066
04:22:20,570 --> 04:22:22,750
When it spins, prepare to be blown away.

4067
04:22:24,890 --> 04:22:26,730
Get into my vagina.

4068
04:22:31,240 --> 04:22:33,940
That was such a fun level.

4069
04:22:33,940 --> 04:22:35,500
Oh my gosh.

4070
04:22:35,640 --> 04:22:38,960
This game never stops impressing me.

4071
04:22:39,020 --> 04:22:43,600
How much I feel like was thought of in this game.

4072
04:22:45,560 --> 04:22:48,900
That was so silly and the song was so cute.

4073
04:22:49,960 --> 04:22:51,240
I loved it.

4074
04:22:51,320 --> 04:22:52,060
It was so much fun.

4075
04:22:56,460 --> 04:22:58,020
Do I need to blow this?

4076
04:23:02,540 --> 04:23:03,460
Maybe not.

4077
04:23:03,600 --> 04:23:04,760
I need to dump it out.

4078
04:23:10,260 --> 04:23:11,540
Get out of there!

4079
04:23:17,720 --> 04:23:21,340
I think we did it.

4080
04:23:31,060 --> 04:23:31,600
Squeeze!

4081
04:23:32,420 --> 04:23:32,960
Squeeze!

4082
04:23:33,620 --> 04:23:34,160
Squeeze!

4083
04:23:35,040 --> 04:23:35,560
Squeeze!

4084
04:23:37,580 --> 04:23:40,460
It takes two has a similar vibe variety in gameplay.

4085
04:23:40,840 --> 04:23:42,580
Yeah, I have seen it takes two before.

4086
04:23:43,440 --> 04:23:44,200
Oh super.

4087
04:23:49,100 --> 04:23:50,460
Oh dump it in.

4088
04:23:50,600 --> 04:23:50,860
Sorry.

4089
04:23:51,080 --> 04:23:52,440
Don't drink the coolant everybody.

4090
04:23:53,160 --> 04:23:54,560
Don't drink the coolant.

4091
04:24:00,410 --> 04:24:02,850
Oh, but it looks really delicious.

4092
04:24:03,390 --> 04:24:04,930
Wait, it looks kind of jelly.

4093
04:24:05,850 --> 04:24:08,970
Wait, it's my favorite thing!

4094
04:24:12,610 --> 04:24:14,290
Freezing taste.

4095
04:24:15,130 --> 04:24:18,750
Thank you garbage man.

4096
04:24:36,680 --> 04:24:37,780
Feels so cool.

4097
04:24:37,900 --> 04:24:38,920
Feels so good.

4098
04:24:46,380 --> 04:24:48,400
And into the hole.

4099
04:24:53,560 --> 04:24:54,260
Freeza!

4100
04:24:54,260 --> 04:24:55,880
I love the clapping.

4101
04:24:57,200 --> 04:24:58,080
Keep it cool.

4102
04:24:58,240 --> 04:24:58,940
Keep it cool.

4103
04:24:59,140 --> 04:24:59,900
Keep it cool.

4104
04:25:00,040 --> 04:25:00,700
Keep it cool.

4105
04:25:06,860 --> 04:25:07,980
It's me, I'm back.

4106
04:25:09,700 --> 04:25:12,400
I can't believe these count as little bots.

4107
04:25:13,820 --> 04:25:14,940
Are we building a PC?

4108
04:25:15,120 --> 04:25:16,700
No, we are building a PS5.

4109
04:25:20,180 --> 04:25:21,400
All is well.

4110
04:25:24,920 --> 04:25:26,640
Another guy is crashing!

4111
04:25:31,080 --> 04:25:33,140
Time to finally go here.

4112
04:25:33,900 --> 04:25:34,780
I see a snake.

4113
04:25:39,180 --> 04:25:40,340
Hi snake.

4114
04:25:41,260 --> 04:25:42,440
Hi Raiden.

4115
04:25:43,580 --> 04:25:44,480
Where is the other snake?

4116
04:25:47,000 --> 04:25:47,800
Pyramid head?

4117
04:25:49,700 --> 04:25:50,120
Snake!

4118
04:25:51,540 --> 04:25:52,740
Oh you are here.

4119
04:25:53,300 --> 04:25:54,360
Oh you are worrying me.

4120
04:25:54,480 --> 04:25:55,480
You are worrying me.

4121
04:25:56,340 --> 04:25:58,060
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

4122
04:25:59,680 --> 04:26:01,020
Even Psycho Mantis is here.

4123
04:26:02,660 --> 04:26:03,540
Alright everybody.

4124
04:26:08,670 --> 04:26:10,050
He is too sneaky.

4125
04:26:10,900 --> 04:26:12,450
Egypt you place.

4126
04:26:13,250 --> 04:26:14,070
Exciting.

4127
04:26:14,710 --> 04:26:16,330
End position everybody.

4128
04:26:16,650 --> 04:26:17,970
Where is the last three people?

4129
04:26:19,190 --> 04:26:21,850
Someone is not pulling their weight.

4130
04:26:23,810 --> 04:26:28,660
Do I go down?

4131
04:26:33,200 --> 04:26:34,200
Oh gosh you guys.

4132
04:26:34,700 --> 04:26:35,440
Don't drop me.

4133
04:26:37,360 --> 04:26:38,940
We are alright.

4134
04:26:39,300 --> 04:26:39,920
Alright everybody.

4135
04:26:40,500 --> 04:26:42,280
They magically got here.

4136
04:26:44,600 --> 04:26:45,660
Wait, let me in too.

4137
04:26:45,740 --> 04:26:46,360
Let me in too.

4138
04:26:49,500 --> 04:26:49,960
Ok,

4139
04:26:56,710 --> 04:26:57,510
that's how we get home.

4140
04:26:58,290 --> 04:26:58,970
Alright everybody.

4141
04:26:59,670 --> 04:27:00,610
Be on standby.

4142
04:27:01,030 --> 04:27:01,890
Be on standby.

4143
04:27:02,790 --> 04:27:05,470
How did you get in here?

4144
04:27:05,550 --> 04:27:06,630
How long have you been here?

4145
04:27:07,210 --> 04:27:08,370
You are probably starving.

4146
04:27:11,030 --> 04:27:11,490
120?

4147
04:27:11,490 --> 04:27:11,650
120?

4148
04:27:15,010 --> 04:27:16,650
That wasn't a very good whistle.

4149
04:27:16,830 --> 04:27:17,510
Sorry guys.

4150
04:27:22,430 --> 04:27:24,650
Schwarzer, thanks for five months.

4151
04:27:30,110 --> 04:27:34,110
Oh my gosh there are more guys up there.

4152
04:27:34,530 --> 04:27:35,270
Three whole guys.

4153
04:27:38,710 --> 04:27:39,270
Hold.

4154
04:27:39,710 --> 04:27:40,270
Hold.

4155
04:27:40,970 --> 04:27:41,190
How

4156
04:27:47,360 --> 04:27:48,020
many more guys?

4157
04:27:49,520 --> 04:27:50,080
Here?

4158
04:27:51,180 --> 04:27:52,020
What are we doing?

4159
04:27:53,040 --> 04:27:53,960
Let me in.

4160
04:27:58,420 --> 04:27:58,980
What

4161
04:28:04,090 --> 04:28:05,250
about over here everybody?

4162
04:28:05,730 --> 04:28:06,330
We are not done?

4163
04:28:06,970 --> 04:28:07,750
100 guys?

4164
04:28:09,430 --> 04:28:11,150
We are getting everything done here.

4165
04:28:11,250 --> 04:28:11,830
Holy moly.

4166
04:28:12,370 --> 04:28:12,810
Oh me too?

4167
04:28:12,890 --> 04:28:13,250
I'll go in.

4168
04:28:13,970 --> 04:28:15,630
Oh my god we are...

4169
04:28:16,530 --> 04:28:17,610
Oh gosh.

4170
04:28:20,330 --> 04:28:20,870
Nice.

4171
04:28:21,790 --> 04:28:23,290
Alright everybody get out.

4172
04:28:24,330 --> 04:28:26,270
They are just all chilling there.

4173
04:28:32,310 --> 04:28:33,930
This game is so funny.

4174
04:28:34,850 --> 04:28:35,710
Can I get this guy?

4175
04:28:36,550 --> 04:28:37,830
I almost had his butt.

4176
04:28:38,050 --> 04:28:38,910
I got him.

4177
04:28:38,990 --> 04:28:39,510
Oh my gosh.

4178
04:28:39,650 --> 04:28:39,810
Wow.

4179
04:28:50,290 --> 04:28:52,030
Are we the baddies?

4180
04:28:52,450 --> 04:28:55,010
I mean we did kind of just take over this planet.

4181
04:28:56,750 --> 04:29:00,050
Like these things lived here before us and we just kind of took it over.

4182
04:29:01,430 --> 04:29:02,410
Alright, four guys.

4183
04:29:02,490 --> 04:29:02,850
Come on.

4184
04:29:02,910 --> 04:29:03,470
Where are you?

4185
04:29:04,350 --> 04:29:05,910
Someone is not pulling their weight.

4186
04:29:08,730 --> 04:29:09,210
Easy.

4187
04:29:13,490 --> 04:29:13,970
Easy.

4188
04:29:15,570 --> 04:29:16,050
Easy.

4189
04:29:19,030 --> 04:29:19,790
Wow!

4190
04:29:20,450 --> 04:29:21,130
Defendership.

4191
04:29:25,480 --> 04:29:26,200
There is more.

4192
04:29:27,860 --> 04:29:30,080
There is much more we must do.

4193
04:29:30,300 --> 04:29:33,820
They are all just watching me in such awe and admiring me.

4194
04:29:34,000 --> 04:29:36,820
My beautiful parkour skills.

4195
04:29:37,520 --> 04:29:38,320
They are like, wow!

4196
04:29:39,280 --> 04:29:40,300
Mito amazing!

4197
04:29:42,060 --> 04:29:44,560
Wow the most cool ever!

4198
04:29:45,740 --> 04:29:46,500
250!

4199
04:29:46,500 --> 04:29:46,980
I'm 50!

4200
04:29:48,600 --> 04:29:48,980
Ok.

4201
04:29:50,040 --> 04:29:51,400
I know your game.

4202
04:29:51,720 --> 04:29:52,560
I see your game.

4203
04:29:55,340 --> 04:29:56,380
Oh gosh.

4204
04:30:02,910 --> 04:30:04,730
Wow Mito amazing!

4205
04:30:06,530 --> 04:30:08,830
Mito has such strong powers.

4206
04:30:09,230 --> 04:30:10,150
Ok we can do this one.

4207
04:30:11,330 --> 04:30:12,070
What's this one over here?

4208
04:30:14,270 --> 04:30:16,210
Why don't I just take the ladder?

4209
04:30:16,210 --> 04:30:17,650
What are you guys doing?

4210
04:30:20,770 --> 04:30:21,590
Oh we push.

4211
04:30:30,790 --> 04:30:32,470
Now I...oh nice.

4212
04:30:46,570 --> 04:30:49,310
Oh I thought I needed to beat them up to join my party.

4213
04:30:49,830 --> 04:30:50,390
Sorry.

4214
04:30:50,850 --> 04:30:52,610
I just smacked their asses for no reason.

4215
04:30:53,970 --> 04:30:55,750
Or was there a reason?

4216
04:30:57,910 --> 04:30:59,050
I'm just saying.

4217
04:31:01,610 --> 04:31:05,960
Do you need a reason to smack ass?

4218
04:31:06,720 --> 04:31:07,860
Of course not.

4219
04:31:11,720 --> 04:31:12,600
Come on!

4220
04:31:14,440 --> 04:31:15,040
Hello.

4221
04:31:16,380 --> 04:31:16,900
Oh god.

4222
04:31:25,870 --> 04:31:26,810
Nobody is dead right?

4223
04:31:27,310 --> 04:31:28,250
Everybody is alive?

4224
04:31:28,370 --> 04:31:29,710
Don't fall in the lava please.

4225
04:31:33,560 --> 04:31:34,080
Ouch!

4226
04:31:37,940 --> 04:31:38,460
Ok.

4227
04:31:38,740 --> 04:31:39,520
Don't fall in.

4228
04:31:39,580 --> 04:31:40,180
Don't fall in.

4229
04:31:41,560 --> 04:31:42,700
Ok it's time you guys.

4230
04:31:44,620 --> 04:31:44,980
Ok.

4231
04:31:46,520 --> 04:31:47,560
It's for...whoa!

4232
04:31:48,360 --> 04:31:49,340
Barrel muncher.

4233
04:31:49,920 --> 04:31:51,140
Sometimes does what it's told.

4234
04:31:51,960 --> 04:31:53,560
Can it get me out of here?

4235
04:31:54,840 --> 04:31:55,200
No.

4236
04:31:55,420 --> 04:31:55,640
Ok.

4237
04:31:56,420 --> 04:31:56,780
Hold on.

4238
04:31:56,900 --> 04:31:57,160
I'll wait.

4239
04:31:57,520 --> 04:31:58,040
There we go.

4240
04:32:00,580 --> 04:32:03,080
Smacking ass is how I made all my closest friends.

4241
04:32:03,760 --> 04:32:04,880
And my mortal enemies.

4242
04:32:09,320 --> 04:32:10,620
Oh I see.

4243
04:32:13,600 --> 04:32:15,300
Anybody else want to join me?

4244
04:32:19,130 --> 04:32:20,790
Ok they are all just down there.

4245
04:32:21,030 --> 04:32:22,290
Just let them chill I guess.

4246
04:32:23,390 --> 04:32:28,050
I think I've done all that I can for now.

4247
04:32:28,050 --> 04:32:29,910
We have 216.

4248
04:32:31,070 --> 04:32:31,510
Gosh.

4249
04:32:32,110 --> 04:32:34,430
We have less than 100 left guys.

4250
04:32:35,370 --> 04:32:39,130
I think we've done everything else in this area that we can for now though.

4251
04:32:42,810 --> 04:32:44,090
Are they starting to jump up?

4252
04:32:53,870 --> 04:32:55,910
Did you open the 200 one in the ice zone?

4253
04:32:56,010 --> 04:32:56,710
I did, yeah.

4254
04:32:57,390 --> 04:32:58,170
I did, I did.

4255
04:32:58,390 --> 04:32:58,950
Thank you though.

4256
04:33:08,550 --> 04:33:10,250
Press triangle to call...Oh I can?

4257
04:33:10,250 --> 04:33:11,610
I didn't realize.

4258
04:33:11,790 --> 04:33:12,730
Thank you though.

4259
04:33:14,930 --> 04:33:21,250
Our final universe to be called upon is...

4260
04:33:22,570 --> 04:33:23,950
The bird universe.

4261
04:33:26,790 --> 04:33:28,390
The bird zone.

4262
04:33:29,190 --> 04:33:30,410
Feather cluster.

4263
04:33:32,990 --> 04:33:35,130
I really feel like I could finish today.

4264
04:33:35,130 --> 04:33:35,230
Ok.

4265
04:33:39,270 --> 04:33:40,950
Oh my gosh!

4266
04:33:43,390 --> 04:33:44,470
You rude!

4267
04:33:44,990 --> 04:33:46,390
Rude, rude alien!

4268
04:33:51,150 --> 04:33:52,610
Oh there is a lot in here.

4269
04:33:52,990 --> 04:33:55,530
How much did the last one have?

4270
04:34:01,830 --> 04:34:03,270
Oh, just as many.

4271
04:34:03,610 --> 04:34:08,330
It's hard to think about that because it feels so fast sometimes.

4272
04:34:20,480 --> 04:34:23,520
I think I'll save it for one last stream.

4273
04:34:30,420 --> 04:34:33,200
I think I'll save it for one...

4274
04:34:37,640 --> 04:34:38,440
last stream.

4275
04:34:49,070 --> 04:34:50,490
A couple more hours to go.

4276
04:34:50,610 --> 04:34:51,890
Yeah, it feels like that, right?

4277
04:34:52,430 --> 04:34:57,470
And I don't necessarily want to 100% it, but I do want to get like...

4278
04:34:58,050 --> 04:35:02,830
Like, because I...It depends on how I feel to get all the challenge levels, you know?

4279
04:35:02,870 --> 04:35:06,210
But I do want to at least get all the puzzle pieces from each thing.

4280
04:35:08,470 --> 04:35:11,670
And we still are missing a few from the older levels.

4281
04:35:12,970 --> 04:35:13,830
Gacha time!

4282
04:35:14,310 --> 04:35:15,730
Wait, how much money do I have?

4283
04:35:17,250 --> 04:35:18,430
How much money do I got?

4284
04:35:23,430 --> 04:35:25,850
Oh yeah, I do want to do the secret warp levels.

4285
04:35:27,050 --> 04:35:29,350
Let's do that one that I just unlocked, right?

4286
04:35:29,710 --> 04:35:31,690
That one warp level that I just unlocked.

4287
04:35:35,740 --> 04:35:37,180
Actually, let's do that.

4288
04:35:37,260 --> 04:35:37,600
Sorry.

4289
04:35:38,540 --> 04:35:42,340
Let's do that and then we'll do the gacha, because...

4290
04:35:42,340 --> 04:35:43,400
I'll get more money, you know?

4291
04:35:44,600 --> 04:35:45,580
Damien, thank you!

4292
04:35:46,080 --> 04:35:46,860
Thanks for the super chat!

4293
04:35:47,440 --> 04:35:49,200
How is your new model so cute?

4294
04:35:49,300 --> 04:35:50,120
I love it.

4295
04:35:51,360 --> 04:35:52,260
Thank you.

4296
04:35:53,600 --> 04:35:54,600
Thank you, thank you.

4297
04:35:59,120 --> 04:36:00,280
We'll do this one.

4298
04:36:01,520 --> 04:36:02,580
Danger dojo.

4299
04:36:05,300 --> 04:36:08,460
And then we can do a gacha.

4300
04:36:15,220 --> 04:36:17,800
There really is danger dojo.

4301
04:36:18,060 --> 04:36:18,780
Is my ship OK?

4302
04:36:21,840 --> 04:36:22,900
My ship.

4303
04:36:28,060 --> 04:36:29,820
The music is awesome though.

4304
04:36:38,590 --> 04:36:40,190
A little caterpillar.

4305
04:36:41,310 --> 04:36:41,870
Sorry.

4306
04:36:54,980 --> 04:36:57,120
Oh my God, I'm running up walls.

4307
04:36:57,160 --> 04:36:57,840
I'm a real ninja.

4308
04:36:58,480 --> 04:36:59,320
I see him over there.

4309
04:37:00,940 --> 04:37:02,000
I see you.

4310
04:37:02,120 --> 04:37:02,920
Oh my gosh.

4311
04:37:03,500 --> 04:37:05,460
Let go of my friend.

4312
04:37:08,570 --> 04:37:09,130
Nice.

4313
04:37:09,590 --> 04:37:10,510
And money.

4314
04:37:20,900 --> 04:37:22,480
Nobody saw that.

4315
04:37:23,440 --> 04:37:24,680
Nobody saw that either.

4316
04:37:29,380 --> 04:37:31,120
Nobody saw that either, OK?

4317
04:37:31,620 --> 04:37:32,880
Yeah, we're good.

4318
04:37:33,340 --> 04:37:34,440
Don't worry about it.

4319
04:37:34,740 --> 04:37:35,780
Is there anything up there, you think?

4320
04:37:40,150 --> 04:37:41,050
Maybe not.

4321
04:37:51,340 --> 04:37:52,900
Yeah, you saw nothing.

4322
04:37:52,900 --> 04:37:53,720
Oh.

4323
04:37:56,660 --> 04:37:57,580
Goodbye lamp.

4324
04:38:05,100 --> 04:38:05,560
Volcano.

4325
04:38:07,300 --> 04:38:08,560
Oh, it's this part.

4326
04:38:11,740 --> 04:38:13,080
I have to be able to get him.

4327
04:38:14,120 --> 04:38:16,120
So do I like create my own platform?

4328
04:38:17,340 --> 04:38:18,920
Maybe this one needs to be a bit lower.

4329
04:38:22,360 --> 04:38:23,600
You think it's too low?

4330
04:38:25,100 --> 04:38:25,740
Let's see.

4331
04:38:25,740 --> 04:38:25,800
Let's see.

4332
04:38:28,500 --> 04:38:29,300
Oh my gosh.

4333
04:38:29,380 --> 04:38:29,720
No!

4334
04:38:32,520 --> 04:38:33,420
I hear you!

4335
04:38:33,480 --> 04:38:33,920
Hold on!

4336
04:38:34,280 --> 04:38:34,700
Oh my God.

4337
04:38:35,260 --> 04:38:36,680
I have to get that guy first.

4338
04:38:37,120 --> 04:38:39,240
Oh wait.

4339
04:38:39,440 --> 04:38:39,700
Uh-oh.

4340
04:38:42,300 --> 04:38:43,580
I made it somehow.

4341
04:38:45,880 --> 04:38:48,080
I think I did a good job, you guys.

4342
04:38:48,680 --> 04:38:49,880
I think I did it.

4343
04:38:50,020 --> 04:38:50,340
Nice.

4344
04:38:52,840 --> 04:38:54,000
I'm pretty good at that.

4345
04:38:57,880 --> 04:39:03,120
I was talking with the team who did Freak or Treat with me.

4346
04:39:04,060 --> 04:39:06,260
And we were thinking of...

4347
04:39:06,880 --> 04:39:07,940
Get out of here.

4348
04:39:08,600 --> 04:39:10,740
Of doing like seasonal updates.

4349
04:39:11,980 --> 04:39:15,040
Maybe even making a way to have...

4350
04:39:15,040 --> 04:39:17,780
For people to be able to make their own levels.

4351
04:39:18,820 --> 04:39:21,280
But that is still not confirmed.

4352
04:39:23,660 --> 04:39:26,620
But we'll probably do seasonal updates and stuff.

4353
04:39:26,620 --> 04:39:28,220
Just a little bit at least.

4354
04:39:29,260 --> 04:39:31,620
Not a ton probably, but...

4355
04:39:35,220 --> 04:39:35,700
Yeah.

4356
04:39:44,010 --> 04:39:45,410
Oh, one more guy.

4357
04:39:45,510 --> 04:39:47,590
How did I do the flower?

4358
04:39:49,130 --> 04:39:50,350
Oh yeah, that's right.

4359
04:39:55,670 --> 04:39:56,150
Monkey!

4360
04:40:00,510 --> 04:40:01,330
Get off this.

4361
04:40:01,330 --> 04:40:01,910
This is my monkey.

4362
04:40:02,050 --> 04:40:03,310
This is my platform monkey.

4363
04:40:07,860 --> 04:40:08,620
So yeah.

4364
04:40:11,260 --> 04:40:13,780
It was funny because he was just like...

4365
04:40:13,780 --> 04:40:15,480
You know, it would be really fun to do this.

4366
04:40:15,800 --> 04:40:17,760
We know you already spent a lot of money on it.

4367
04:40:18,860 --> 04:40:20,840
I was like...

4368
04:40:20,840 --> 04:40:22,840
But it was so much fun making it.

4369
04:40:23,280 --> 04:40:25,100
I didn't do so much, you know, obviously.

4370
04:40:25,300 --> 04:40:27,340
I'm not a game developer, but...

4371
04:40:29,300 --> 04:40:32,700
Just like, being part of the planning and everything was so much fun.

4372
04:40:40,150 --> 04:40:40,850
A few days late.

4373
04:40:40,890 --> 04:40:41,490
Grats on the new model.

4374
04:40:41,590 --> 04:40:42,170
Thank you!

4375
04:40:46,810 --> 04:40:47,570
Oh my god.

4376
04:40:49,010 --> 04:40:49,410
Ambush!

4377
04:40:49,590 --> 04:40:49,770
Ambush!

4378
04:40:49,890 --> 04:40:50,250
Ambush!

4379
04:40:51,630 --> 04:40:53,690
Wait, I wanted to check that room out.

4380
04:40:54,810 --> 04:40:59,130
There were some more people I wanted to include, but they didn't...

4381
04:40:59,130 --> 04:41:03,030
Like, one of the people didn't respond to me until literally yesterday.

4382
04:41:06,510 --> 04:41:09,070
So, I was like, okay, well...

4383
04:41:09,070 --> 04:41:12,170
In the update, I can fit you in probably.

4384
04:41:14,230 --> 04:41:15,230
Western warrior.

4385
04:41:15,670 --> 04:41:16,830
A pirate and a samurai?

4386
04:41:17,510 --> 04:41:18,010
Deadly.

4387
04:41:19,350 --> 04:41:22,510
Yeah, I didn't want to include anybody as an NPC.

4388
04:41:23,470 --> 04:41:26,010
Unless I, you know, got their explicit permission.

4389
04:41:26,350 --> 04:41:28,330
But also, I needed the...

4390
04:41:28,330 --> 04:41:30,530
I wanted the voice...

4391
04:41:30,530 --> 04:41:31,070
Oh my gosh.

4392
04:41:31,070 --> 04:41:34,210
I wanted the voice clips for it, so...

4393
04:41:34,970 --> 04:41:35,730
The voice lines.

4394
04:41:36,670 --> 04:41:37,890
What are these ones from?

4395
04:41:38,150 --> 04:41:38,650
Oh, Neo!

4396
04:41:39,210 --> 04:41:40,090
Vengeful spirit.

4397
04:41:40,370 --> 04:41:41,370
It's me!

4398
04:41:42,070 --> 04:41:43,590
A samurai no more.

4399
04:41:44,410 --> 04:41:48,070
Freakin' watch will become the second most popular portable guide, so...

4400
04:41:50,330 --> 04:41:51,670
I'm sure it will.

4401
04:41:56,370 --> 04:41:57,870
I'm messing up there.

4402
04:41:58,690 --> 04:42:00,470
Their zen garden.

4403
04:42:03,050 --> 04:42:04,610
This level is so cool.

4404
04:42:07,250 --> 04:42:10,490
Wait, where do I go?

4405
04:42:16,780 --> 04:42:17,480
Shoot.

4406
04:42:18,560 --> 04:42:22,740
That was

4407
04:42:26,310 --> 04:42:26,630
close.

4408
04:42:34,150 --> 04:42:34,590
Nice.

4409
04:42:37,630 --> 04:42:39,310
Freak or treat was incredibly fun.

4410
04:42:39,630 --> 04:42:42,150
Whether you update it or not, I want to say thank you for it.

4411
04:42:42,850 --> 04:42:43,910
It was my...

4412
04:42:43,910 --> 04:42:44,590
It was...

4413
04:42:44,590 --> 04:42:48,670
Wait, it was all my fun on my first day off in almost a month.

4414
04:42:48,830 --> 04:42:49,070
Bless.

4415
04:42:49,310 --> 04:42:51,210
I'm really happy to hear that.

4416
04:43:02,120 --> 04:43:02,560
Platform.

4417
04:43:03,140 --> 04:43:03,580
Again.

4418
04:43:06,660 --> 04:43:08,680
OK, that should be...

4419
04:43:08,680 --> 04:43:09,520
Maybe good?

4420
04:43:39,440 --> 04:43:40,860
Don't like that.

4421
04:43:42,600 --> 04:43:46,820
I really like trick or treat beat as a kid, so this version is pretty nostalgic.

4422
04:43:47,660 --> 04:43:48,240
Me too!

4423
04:43:48,420 --> 04:43:51,760
It was one of my favorite online games to play as a kid.

4424
04:43:52,780 --> 04:43:53,860
So I really...

4425
04:43:55,080 --> 04:43:56,860
Wanted to bring it...

4426
04:43:58,040 --> 04:43:58,560
Back.

4427
04:43:59,420 --> 04:43:59,940
Nice.

4428
04:44:00,520 --> 04:44:01,460
First try, baby.

4429
04:44:04,020 --> 04:44:05,860
I really wanted to...

4430
04:44:07,360 --> 04:44:08,400
Bring it...

4431
04:44:08,400 --> 04:44:08,820
Back.

4432
04:44:09,720 --> 04:44:10,560
Whoa!

4433
04:44:11,980 --> 04:44:13,360
But wait, wait, wait.

4434
04:44:13,580 --> 04:44:14,800
What was over there?

4435
04:44:16,500 --> 04:44:18,300
Hold on, hold on.

4436
04:44:19,160 --> 04:44:20,580
I saw this.

4437
04:44:24,740 --> 04:44:25,240
This one.

4438
04:44:35,580 --> 04:44:36,540
Oh, this one.

4439
04:44:36,980 --> 04:44:41,080
Oh, this one.

4440
04:44:41,900 --> 04:44:43,740
Oh my gosh!

4441
04:44:44,220 --> 04:44:44,640
Money!

4442
04:44:48,520 --> 04:44:54,140
Are you OK being in a game and us using the sounds you make on stream before the game?

4443
04:44:56,440 --> 04:44:57,940
Is this a real proposition?

4444
04:44:58,420 --> 04:44:59,840
Or like a real question?

4445
04:45:00,140 --> 04:45:00,960
Or are you just...

4446
04:45:01,580 --> 04:45:03,540
I mean, yeah, of course I'm OK with that.

4447
04:45:09,420 --> 04:45:10,820
But I'm also nervous.

4448
04:45:12,320 --> 04:45:13,440
But I'm also...

4449
04:45:14,040 --> 04:45:15,040
Scared of what you'll make.

4450
04:45:15,820 --> 04:45:17,520
What do you mean what sounds I make?

4451
04:45:35,610 --> 04:45:36,770
OK, that should be good.

4452
04:45:37,370 --> 04:45:38,670
Oh wait, I'm losing some of them!

4453
04:45:41,350 --> 04:45:42,090
Oh, shoot.

4454
04:45:42,770 --> 04:45:43,410
Got it.

4455
04:45:52,230 --> 04:45:53,810
Wait, I'm too good at the game.

4456
04:45:57,310 --> 04:46:03,850
Ever stop and wonder about the construction process of video game castles and dungeons and stuff from the in-game universe point of view?

4457
04:46:04,330 --> 04:46:05,850
Yeah, I do actually.

4458
04:46:05,850 --> 04:46:07,470
Demon swordsman!

4459
04:46:07,890 --> 04:46:09,870
Took up the gauntlet against a demon army.

4460
04:46:14,410 --> 04:46:14,970
Wait.

4461
04:46:15,890 --> 04:46:17,770
I think I need to do this again.

4462
04:46:25,650 --> 04:46:26,930
That should be good.

4463
04:46:27,470 --> 04:46:27,910
Probably.

4464
04:46:42,890 --> 04:46:43,670
Easy game.

4465
04:46:44,590 --> 04:46:46,370
Easy game, easy game, easy game.

4466
04:46:46,630 --> 04:46:47,270
Did I get everything?

4467
04:46:48,810 --> 04:46:49,750
Easy game.

4468
04:46:50,370 --> 04:46:50,850
Easy game.

4469
04:46:55,810 --> 04:46:56,530
Oh

4470
04:47:00,010 --> 04:47:01,250
my gosh, guys!

4471
04:47:03,190 --> 04:47:04,150
I'm a ninja.

4472
04:47:05,590 --> 04:47:06,470
With a smoothie.

4473
04:47:07,550 --> 04:47:08,250
Say cheese!

4474
04:47:12,060 --> 04:47:14,880
Oh, now we get money for... Oh my gosh.

4475
04:47:15,220 --> 04:47:15,860
They're hunting me!

4476
04:47:17,020 --> 04:47:18,680
I destroyed it!

4477
04:47:19,560 --> 04:47:21,700
I destroyed their hunt on me.

4478
04:47:22,280 --> 04:47:23,100
Sorry, guys.

4479
04:47:24,820 --> 04:47:25,540
Tamago.

4480
04:47:27,100 --> 04:47:28,120
I'll take it.

4481
04:47:29,600 --> 04:47:31,420
Actually, I really want sushi now.

4482
04:47:46,040 --> 04:47:46,600
Wait.

4483
04:47:50,340 --> 04:47:50,900
No!

4484
04:48:06,550 --> 04:48:08,050
Oh my gosh, this is kind of weird.

4485
04:48:08,150 --> 04:48:08,670
Oh my gosh.

4486
04:48:14,810 --> 04:48:15,370
Okay.

4487
04:48:22,790 --> 04:48:23,910
My aim...

4488
04:48:23,910 --> 04:48:26,290
My depth perception is...

4489
04:48:31,190 --> 04:48:32,870
First try.

4490
04:48:33,830 --> 04:48:35,070
Guys, it's an easy game.

4491
04:48:36,010 --> 04:48:37,370
Easy game.

4492
04:48:38,370 --> 04:48:39,290
Idiot sandwich.

4493
04:48:40,330 --> 04:48:41,630
Welcome to membership.

4494
04:48:42,110 --> 04:48:42,550
Thank you.

4495
04:48:54,910 --> 04:48:56,030
I

4496
04:48:59,700 --> 04:49:02,220
could have gotten the big money.

4497
04:49:04,400 --> 04:49:05,580
My bad.

4498
04:49:07,060 --> 04:49:09,220
I could have gotten the big money.

4499
04:49:10,180 --> 04:49:10,800
Secret!

4500
04:49:15,120 --> 04:49:15,860
Don't...

4501
04:49:18,140 --> 04:49:19,920
Don't worry about it.

4502
04:49:20,420 --> 04:49:22,500
Don't worry about it.

4503
04:49:24,160 --> 04:49:25,600
Alright, gacha time.

4504
04:49:26,320 --> 04:49:28,000
Hello, welcome to the army!

4505
04:49:30,520 --> 04:49:32,120
We need 30 more.

4506
04:49:35,600 --> 04:49:37,500
We're making like a big statue?

4507
04:49:38,800 --> 04:49:41,620
Use this 7 month memble flex for gacha luck.

4508
04:49:42,020 --> 04:49:42,840
They're cool!

4509
04:49:43,420 --> 04:49:44,300
7 months!

4510
04:49:46,480 --> 04:49:47,280
Let's go.

4511
04:49:50,280 --> 04:49:51,360
What do we want?

4512
04:49:51,480 --> 04:49:53,620
Oh my gosh, there's a soda can right at the bottom.

4513
04:49:55,380 --> 04:49:56,580
Okay, we want...

4514
04:49:59,600 --> 04:50:02,140
There was something else I think I wanted.

4515
04:50:02,920 --> 04:50:06,380
12 months for flex for luck.

4516
04:50:06,520 --> 04:50:07,320
Let's go!

4517
04:50:07,420 --> 04:50:08,420
Oh yes, Raiden's item.

4518
04:50:08,800 --> 04:50:10,920
Raiden and if there's a snake outfit.

4519
04:50:14,120 --> 04:50:15,380
A bo staff.

4520
04:50:16,580 --> 04:50:16,620
Okay.

4521
04:50:20,200 --> 04:50:22,680
I'm gonna fucking become the Joker.

4522
04:50:26,760 --> 04:50:28,020
Evidence collectors.

4523
04:50:29,080 --> 04:50:30,000
Who is this?

4524
04:50:30,600 --> 04:50:31,600
Looks like Maddie.

4525
04:50:34,220 --> 04:50:36,500
I just got sushi for the first time.

4526
04:50:37,060 --> 04:50:38,920
Was a little sad because it arrived hot.

4527
04:50:39,580 --> 04:50:41,880
But it's okay, I microwaved it for a minute before eating.

4528
04:50:42,040 --> 04:50:42,580
Wait, what?

4529
04:50:44,540 --> 04:50:46,020
Fukura, thanks for the gift!

4530
04:50:49,360 --> 04:50:50,400
Explosive cask.

4531
04:50:52,260 --> 04:50:54,380
Make monsters go boom!

4532
04:51:06,680 --> 04:51:07,200
Outfit?

4533
04:51:07,200 --> 04:51:07,260
Outfit!

4534
04:51:09,360 --> 04:51:11,960
I can become gross?

4535
04:51:12,500 --> 04:51:14,320
Star creator, thanks for the gift!

4536
04:51:19,480 --> 04:51:21,220
Wait, stealth outfit?

4537
04:51:23,960 --> 04:51:27,500
This isn't the stealth outfit I wanted!

4538
04:51:37,780 --> 04:51:40,780
This game is making a mockery of me.

4539
04:51:47,250 --> 04:51:50,630
This game is making a mockery of me!

4540
04:51:58,290 --> 04:51:59,670
Close enough.

4541
04:52:01,030 --> 04:52:02,950
We have to put it on though.

4542
04:52:03,670 --> 04:52:07,190
It's a stealth outfit, we gotta put it on, I guess.

4543
04:52:11,910 --> 04:52:14,050
We have stealth outfit at home.

4544
04:52:16,330 --> 04:52:24,530
It would be awesome if it actually made me hard to see by enemies and all.

4545
04:52:26,030 --> 04:52:27,970
This one looks freaky.

4546
04:52:28,730 --> 04:52:29,430
What is it?

4547
04:52:29,470 --> 04:52:30,410
Last of Us, right?

4548
04:52:32,770 --> 04:52:34,590
Eww, I'm so nasty!

4549
04:52:46,800 --> 04:52:48,900
This game is a joke.

4550
04:52:49,460 --> 04:52:50,880
Am I a joke to you game?

4551
04:52:50,880 --> 04:52:52,400
Am I a joke to you?

4552
04:52:52,440 --> 04:52:54,240
We couldn't even get Raiden's thing.

4553
04:52:55,560 --> 04:52:58,460
Didn't I say stream until we get Raiden's item?

4554
04:53:00,320 --> 04:53:01,840
Raiden, give me money!

4555
04:53:01,920 --> 04:53:03,280
I need more money, Raiden!

4556
04:53:06,960 --> 04:53:08,440
Well, we got Raiden today.

4557
04:53:11,280 --> 04:53:12,940
I gamed for him.

4558
04:53:14,100 --> 04:53:15,740
I gamed quite hard actually.

4559
04:53:17,860 --> 04:53:19,140
That was said.

4560
04:53:21,560 --> 04:53:23,120
We got Raiden at least.

4561
04:53:23,580 --> 04:53:24,720
What is this thing?

4562
04:53:25,300 --> 04:53:28,600
Oh, he goes to another location.

4563
04:53:28,720 --> 04:53:29,460
That's so fun.

4564
04:53:36,650 --> 04:53:38,690
Where's that minks for the coin?

4565
04:53:40,430 --> 04:53:41,410
Thank you.

4566
04:53:47,570 --> 04:53:49,910
Our place is so lively.

4567
04:53:50,610 --> 04:53:52,590
There's so many guys here.

4568
04:53:52,790 --> 04:53:53,990
We still have 50 left.

4569
04:53:53,990 --> 04:53:56,250
Mushrooms are good and they love you.

4570
04:53:56,770 --> 04:53:58,050
I hate mushrooms.

4571
04:54:03,120 --> 04:54:04,260
Mushrooms ick.

4572
04:54:05,060 --> 04:54:05,680
What is this?

4573
04:54:06,960 --> 04:54:07,580
What the hell?

4574
04:54:08,960 --> 04:54:10,380
Who left the bathtub here?

4575
04:54:10,800 --> 04:54:12,400
Oh, it's for me.

4576
04:54:15,300 --> 04:54:15,940
What

4577
04:54:23,840 --> 04:54:25,160
is going on?

4578
04:54:29,620 --> 04:54:30,720
That's gross.

4579
04:54:31,480 --> 04:54:33,520
That guy was peeping on me in the bath.

4580
04:54:40,180 --> 04:54:41,620
Is he going to kick my ass?

4581
04:54:41,740 --> 04:54:44,280
Wait, let's see if he does it again.

4582
04:54:47,080 --> 04:54:48,500
He kicked my ass.

4583
04:54:59,230 --> 04:55:00,030
Well guys...

4584
04:55:00,030 --> 04:55:00,750
Oh, what's here?

4585
04:55:04,090 --> 04:55:05,330
Why is this so magical?

4586
04:55:05,950 --> 04:55:06,990
Oh, these are the flowers!

4587
04:55:07,990 --> 04:55:09,210
These are the flowers I got.

4588
04:55:09,310 --> 04:55:09,770
That's right.

4589
04:55:11,790 --> 04:55:12,610
Is that me?

4590
04:55:14,590 --> 04:55:15,310
Wait.

4591
04:55:15,790 --> 04:55:17,950
You can make infinite people.

4592
04:55:18,710 --> 04:55:20,310
Make more little guys.

4593
04:55:20,490 --> 04:55:21,730
Make them join the army.

4594
04:55:25,310 --> 04:55:26,710
That is your duty.

4595
04:55:35,320 --> 04:55:37,360
That was terrifying.

4596
04:55:37,820 --> 04:55:38,400
What a nightmare.

4597
04:55:39,440 --> 04:55:40,380
Guys, this is fun.

4598
04:55:40,380 --> 04:55:42,180
I did think...

4599
04:55:42,180 --> 04:55:47,680
I did think maybe I would try to complete it today, but you know what?

4600
04:55:49,040 --> 04:55:51,680
We'll just go for next time.

4601
04:55:53,020 --> 04:55:56,380
I almost want to do some of the...

4602
04:56:02,120 --> 04:56:03,980
Hold on, let me finish my thought.

4603
04:56:04,220 --> 04:56:05,360
Let me finish my thought.

4604
04:56:05,360 --> 04:56:05,360
What?

4605
04:56:05,720 --> 04:56:07,620
I almost...

4606
04:56:07,620 --> 04:56:09,980
I want to do some of the puzzles off stream.

4607
04:56:10,100 --> 04:56:12,620
Maybe the puzzles of the worlds that I've gone to before.

4608
04:56:13,660 --> 04:56:13,920
Maybe.

4609
04:56:15,760 --> 04:56:16,580
Love the new model.

4610
04:56:16,660 --> 04:56:17,180
Thank you!

4611
04:56:17,620 --> 04:56:19,700
So, I might do... There's like, what?

4612
04:56:19,800 --> 04:56:21,160
Two or three puzzles?

4613
04:56:22,320 --> 04:56:23,920
That I could do off stream probably.

4614
04:56:25,800 --> 04:56:28,720
It's just the puzzle pieces, so...

4615
04:56:28,720 --> 04:56:33,900
For future animators, please have a room of a lot of Minto so we can laugh like an Osanai.

4616
04:56:36,320 --> 04:56:36,740
Lambda!

4617
04:56:37,520 --> 04:56:38,900
Thank you for the Akasupa!

4618
04:56:39,660 --> 04:56:42,320
I don't even know how much this is, but there's a lot of zeros.

4619
04:56:44,980 --> 04:56:46,240
Big Boss by Beloved.

4620
04:56:46,320 --> 04:56:49,660
I wish Konami do Metal Gear collab with gacha anime games.

4621
04:56:50,220 --> 04:56:54,900
I really need to see one of the snake to be in gacha anime game.

4622
04:56:54,900 --> 04:56:57,040
Please, just one gacha game is okay, Konami.

4623
04:56:57,320 --> 04:56:58,420
Please, Konami, I need this.

4624
04:56:58,460 --> 04:57:00,280
My gacha game is kind of snake-less.

4625
04:57:00,380 --> 04:57:01,400
I live with Ocelot.

4626
04:57:01,500 --> 04:57:02,840
I want to help him out.

4627
04:57:07,000 --> 04:57:07,800
So true.

4628
04:57:07,960 --> 04:57:09,300
What do you mean you live with Ocelot?

4629
04:57:10,800 --> 04:57:11,900
What do you mean by that?

4630
04:57:13,740 --> 04:57:15,160
Actually, that's so real.

4631
04:57:16,080 --> 04:57:16,660
Look at me.

4632
04:57:16,720 --> 04:57:18,100
I'm sleeping in front of Snake.

4633
04:57:18,320 --> 04:57:19,380
I'm such a freak.

4634
04:57:21,160 --> 04:57:23,580
Why am I sleeping in front of him?

4635
04:57:27,670 --> 04:57:29,250
This game is such a treasure.

4636
04:57:30,030 --> 04:57:31,590
This game is my treasure.

4637
04:57:32,430 --> 04:57:38,830
Gosh, I'm so glad I got into Metal Gear so I could appreciate all five of these little characters in here.

4638
04:57:39,110 --> 04:57:45,470
I'm so glad that they gave Metal Gear 5 characters, you know, despite it being such an old series.

4639
04:57:46,770 --> 04:57:52,250
Like, they still... There's like series in here that are, you know, I guess more beloved.

4640
04:57:52,250 --> 04:57:58,130
And they only have a few characters, but Metal Gear has five characters.

4641
04:58:00,670 --> 04:58:04,130
Any chance of Metal Gear Online 3 before you reach MGSV?

4642
04:58:05,030 --> 04:58:06,330
Well, I would have to get a server.

4643
04:58:07,270 --> 04:58:08,990
Or like, you know, for it.

4644
04:58:09,550 --> 04:58:13,210
If anyone wants to explain how I can, I would love to do that.

4645
04:58:15,950 --> 04:58:17,170
MGS4, Snake and Nike.

4646
04:58:17,170 --> 04:58:17,290
OK.

4647
04:58:21,960 --> 04:58:23,320
Yeah, I'm so... Oh no!

4648
04:58:23,760 --> 04:58:24,200
Oh no!

4649
04:58:25,140 --> 04:58:26,260
Wait, we gotta save her.

4650
04:58:27,880 --> 04:58:30,080
Oh my god, I don't think that's saving her.

4651
04:58:30,440 --> 04:58:32,580
Wait, I think we just killed Lara Croft.

4652
04:58:34,100 --> 04:58:35,740
Oh my god, he attacks her.

4653
04:58:35,820 --> 04:58:37,140
Oh no, I think he likes her.

4654
04:58:47,560 --> 04:58:48,340
Lev, no, please!

4655
04:58:48,920 --> 04:58:51,020
I don't know how much this is scaring me.

4656
04:58:52,320 --> 04:58:58,860
Hey Minto, can you pray to our lord and save your big boss so I can safely bring home my anime Umineko pachislot machine to Indonesia?

4657
04:58:59,680 --> 04:59:02,760
I'm going to buy MGS3 pachislot if someone sells it with the right condition.

4658
04:59:02,860 --> 04:59:03,720
Next if this succeeds.

4659
04:59:04,540 --> 04:59:05,160
Thank you very much.

4660
04:59:05,220 --> 04:59:06,040
This means a lot to me.

4661
04:59:06,380 --> 04:59:07,940
I'm praying for you.

4662
04:59:09,020 --> 04:59:10,080
I'm praying for you.

4663
04:59:14,820 --> 04:59:18,600
Please let the pachislot get home.

4664
04:59:18,760 --> 04:59:19,540
Ow, I bit my tongue.

4665
04:59:20,620 --> 04:59:21,180
Hold on.

4666
04:59:22,580 --> 04:59:23,400
Get home safely!

4667
04:59:30,430 --> 04:59:34,030
Well guys, probably I guess the next week will be the final.

4668
04:59:34,730 --> 04:59:35,670
Oh, maybe next week.

4669
04:59:36,950 --> 04:59:38,310
Maybe the week after.

4670
04:59:38,590 --> 04:59:40,350
Might be once I'm back from...

4671
04:59:44,070 --> 04:59:44,550
from...

4672
04:59:45,830 --> 04:59:46,790
Great job getting rided!

4673
04:59:46,970 --> 04:59:49,250
Also, I can't get over how minty fresh you look now.

4674
04:59:50,490 --> 04:59:51,230
Thank you!

4675
04:59:52,090 --> 04:59:53,930
Do we get stummy on the next outfit?

4676
04:59:54,490 --> 04:59:55,170
I don't know.

4677
04:59:57,210 --> 04:59:58,070
I don't know.

4678
04:59:58,150 --> 04:59:59,390
You'll just have to wait.

4679
05:00:00,830 --> 05:00:01,790
We'll find out.

4680
05:00:15,160 --> 05:00:17,100
I will see you guys...

4681
05:00:18,200 --> 05:00:18,640
Tomorrow?

4682
05:00:19,460 --> 05:00:20,220
Yes, tomorrow.

4683
05:00:20,580 --> 05:00:22,320
I have to make my schedule still.

4684
05:00:24,000 --> 05:00:25,980
I will be gone a couple days next week.

4685
05:00:25,980 --> 05:00:32,880
Because like I said, I'm going to meet with Deoki.

4686
05:00:33,460 --> 05:00:43,040
So we can practice for our Atlanta concert.

4687
05:00:49,560 --> 05:00:55,060
I don't know what my stream stuff will be.

4688
05:00:55,980 --> 05:00:56,580
Entirely.

4689
05:00:57,800 --> 05:00:59,060
Of the following week.

4690
05:01:00,500 --> 05:01:01,320
But yeah.

4691
05:01:04,180 --> 05:01:05,360
Thanks for the fun stream!

4692
05:01:05,460 --> 05:01:05,980
Thanks Akane!

4693
05:01:06,520 --> 05:01:07,120
Thank you!

4694
05:01:07,460 --> 05:01:08,300
Thank you guys!

4695
05:01:10,880 --> 05:01:14,600
And I will see you tomorrow probably.

4696
05:01:17,760 --> 05:01:18,400
Bye bye!

4697
05:01:19,060 --> 05:01:22,380
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye...

4698
05:01:22,380 --> 05:01:23,460
Bye bye...

4699
05:01:23,460 --> 05:01:27,140
See you guys.

4700
05:01:27,240 --> 05:01:28,560
Bye bye...

4701
05:01:28,560 --> 05:01:29,860
Thank you!

4702
05:01:30,020 --> 05:01:31,120
Thank you!

4703
05:01:31,340 --> 05:01:31,720
Goodbye!

4704
05:01:32,940 --> 05:01:33,520
Bye bye!
