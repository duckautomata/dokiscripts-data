00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello,

3
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,070
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome.

4
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,910
Howdy, howdy.

5
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,960
Bioshock!

6
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,480
Woohoo!

7
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,320
Bioshock.

8
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,780
Oh my gosh, wait, hold on.

9
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,140
I kissed my cat earlier.

10
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,560
And I've had a hair stuck on my lip.

11
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,640
I can't get it.

12
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:09,480
I think I got it.

13
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,940
I think I have it.

14
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait.

15
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,460
I got it.

16
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,670
Nah, it's definitely my cat, sir.

17
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,450
It's black.

18
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,010
Thank you, guys, for coming in.

19
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,510
Thanks for waiting.

20
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,870
Also, um, Bioshock!

21
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,030
First time I've ever played.

22
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,750
Hello, Minto, and I was like you.

23
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,170
Oh, gosh.

24
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,950
I can't read.

25
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,610
I can't scroll back up.

26
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,070
Spoiler, don't kiss your cat after using lip balm.

27
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,210
Or if you are covered in ectoplasm.

28
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,750
Thanks for always lifting my spirits.

29
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,410
Thank you!

30
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,410
Sorry, it's one of those games where I'm locked in the
window.

31
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,250
Oh my gosh, I opened it.

32
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,690
Holy resolution Batman.

33
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,470
It was...

34
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:05,210
This is the... I'm playing the remastered version because I
was worried about resolution issues with the original.

35
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,950
And we're doing our best here.

36
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,630
It's seemingly okay right now.

37
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,850
Yeah, I'm locked in.

38
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,830
I'm locked in.

39
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,630
But, uh, yeah.

40
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,990
Original can be finicky.

41
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:29,790
That's, I've, I heard, you know, usually I like playing
originals of things, but, um, I often, you often find that,

42
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,710
uh, with, with age, they do not do well.

43
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,250
Crayon Bay!

44
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,990

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:56,890
Um, so sorry if I, if you super chat and I can't read it if
chat is going because, you know, I can only read so fast.

52
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,010

56
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:13,860
So if we get into this version and it's kind of like, ugh,
things are not working out so well, we can just switch over.

57
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,100

Ring.

67
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,720
You know that nine out of ten ladies prefer the athletic
man?

68
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,940
Advertisement.

69
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,120
Sport to boost.

70
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,480
Oh.

71
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,460

Welcome to the...

77
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,660
Maybe I should not be in here.

78
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,980
How do I get out?

79
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,780
Back to midvenue.

80
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,580
I wonder.

81
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,380
Should I play this game not controller?

82
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,960
But it's made for controller.

83
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,220
So I'm kind of like...

84
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,320
lots of spoilers we just nope out of there

85
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:31,100
controller's fine might be easier PC controls I always play
with my controller it's better in controller

86
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:44,140
but controller oh yeah with the FPS I'm gonna try I'm gonna
try Not controller.

87
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm scared.

88
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm gonna try.

89
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,060
I often don't.

90
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,950
But...

91
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,220
We could try.

92
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,600
We can see.

93
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,320
We'll see.

94
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,280
Window noises.

95
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, did you hear?

96
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,540

We'll see.

98
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,240
You know, I could always switch anyway.

99
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,960
So it's fine.

100
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:12,760

Medium is premium.

107

You know, I didn't know that nine out of ten ladies
preferred the athletic man.

115
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,390
They told me.

116
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,450
Oh, there's no subtitles.

117
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,910

Whoa.

Jack with love.

126
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,350
Oh my gosh, Minto with love!

127
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,730
It's literally in two days.

128
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,270
I will turn on the subtitles once I am able?

129
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,850
I don't know if I am.

130
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,230
I don't want to accidentally skip a cutscene or anything.

131
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,910
Oh yeah, baby.

132
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,430

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,110
Toes are out?

134
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,050

144
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,460
You think they did this?

145
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,700
Why do we suddenly just crash?

146
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,320
Can I go back?

147
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,680
Are we the only one who survived?

148
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,590
Medium is premium.

149
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,280
Oh, I thought I heard someone behind me.

150
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,050
Why is it doing?

151
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,830
Oh, have I been pushing this thing this entire time?

152
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,130
I'm just like...

153
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,890
My plate, no!

154
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,670
Now I feel insecure without it.

155
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,350
Whoa, it's sinking.

156
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,130
It's making a whole lot of...

157
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,570
Oh, we're collecting junk.

158
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,130
It's making a... Why is it doing that?

159
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,250
Oh my gosh!

160
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:22,990
Titanic!

161
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,650
It won't let me go any further.

162
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:39,550
Wait.

163
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,990
I think I pushed my things to beyond where I can grab them.

164
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,350
No!

165
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,200
Oh, it's gone.

166
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,570
Oh my god, calm down, mister.

167
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,770
Why are you being so loud?

168
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,550
Very convenient.

169
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,290
We crashed right next to this light house.

170
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,330
Question mark?

171
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,230
It's cold, is it?

172
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,610
Are we really Titanic-ing?

173
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,290
Let's see.

174
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,160
It's so dramatic, I know.

175
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,280
Excuse me.

176
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,740
My toes are frozen.

177
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,600
Oh, oh, what does that say?

178
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,640
A quote from Andrew Ryan.

179
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,720
I hear like people talking or something in there.

180
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,740
Like a party.

181
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,120
Party, party.

There's some fancy music going on.

185
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,710
Oh, I can jump.

186
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,190
We are on the sea!

187
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,060
Look at that fish!

188
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,700
No gods or kings, only fish.

189
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,180
I'm like seeing things.

190
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,660
I'm seeing science.

191
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,900
Hello?

192
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,260
This sub, it was made for me.

193
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,100
Why is it so smoky?

194
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,260
Industry.

195
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,580
What's the R?

196
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,680
Is that for Ryan?

197
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,940
What was it, Andrew Ryan?

198
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
Andrew Ryan?

199
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:46,560
How do you, does, how, do you, do anyone else here have two
first names as a first name and last name?

200
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
Which do you pick?

201
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,160
Art.

202
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,500
Oh.

203
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,900
Randro Ryan.

204
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,500
Yeah?

205
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,640
Only cool people had that.

206
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,680
Which did you pick?

207
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,980
the cooler one my mom has first two names or two first names

208
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:29,280
I do and I shared an office with a guy who also did what the
heck fancy venue for the jazz concert honestly this is such

209
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:41,280
a good vibe no man alright let's go in oh Bath is Sphere
lover.

210
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,220
Service radio.

211
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,280
I'm reading these from so far away.

212
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,780
Oh!

213
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,100
My last name is pretty lame.

214
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
Can I take yours?

215
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,060
What are you talking about?

216
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,480
Ten phantoms.

217
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,800
Eighteen phantoms.

218
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,160
Oh.

219
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,450
Ryan Industries, incinerate fire at your fingertips.

220
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,570
I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question.

221
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,350
Sounds like Stewie family guys.

222
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,170
Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?

223
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,910
No, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor.

224
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,270
No, says the man in the Vatican, it belongs to God.

225
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,150
No, says the man in Moscow, it belongs to everyone.

226
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,730
Instead, I chose something different.

227
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,650
I chose the impossible.

228
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,750
I chose rapture.

229
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,090
Crabs!

230
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:00,890
Whoa!

231
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:09,550
A city where the artist would not be in sense, where the
scientist would not be bound by Penny Morales.

232
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,270
This is all below me where I crashed?

233
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,010
Where the great would not be constrained by the small.

234
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,430
And with the sweat from your brow, Whoa.

235
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,170
Rapture can become your city as well.

236
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:21,850
Whoa.

237
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,470
Rapture.

238
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,150
Oh, who's that?

239
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,290
I think he's trying to get my attention.

240
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,770
Oh no, he's fixing something.

241
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:34,730
Whale!

242
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,100
All good things of this earth flow.

244
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:13,640
into the city because like the sewage and stuffer this is so
immersive this is so awesome welcome to rapture use right

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:23,120

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:37,410

guys.

247
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,850
I think I crashed and now I'm scared.

248
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,770
And my toes are really cold.

249
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,100
Oh, Johnny!

250
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,810
Oh, what a welcome.

251
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,670
Splicer female.

252
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,760
Oh, it's a good thing this door hasn't opened.

253
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:15,780
Oh!

254
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,700
No.

255
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,720
Oh, I think we're in trouble.

256
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,460
Radio?

257
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,240
I think we're in trouble, everybody.

258
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,080
Warning, flashing lights.

259
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,620
Oh, I have a health bar.

260
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,420
Oh, God.

261
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,280
Oh, God.

262
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:48,740
Atlas.

263
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,930
Any ground would be Nice.

264
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,440
Bad this way.

265
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,580
Um, what about the lady that, like, has claws for hands?

266
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,040
Or claws for hands?

267
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,420
We're gonna need to draw her out of hiding.

268
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:20,610
Okay.

269
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,960
Vita chamber.

270
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,860
What's this?

271
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:35,100
If you are killed by the hostile denizens of Rapture, oh,
you will be revived live and whole at the last Vita chamber

272
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,840
you passed.

273
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,760
Some of your health will be restored and you will always
have at least a small amount of Eve.

274
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,520
I don't know what Eve is yet.

275
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,340
Veda chambers work automatically.

276
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,380
There's no need to use or activate them.

277
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,700
Oh yeah, that's handy.

278
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,260
Oh.

279
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,600
A respawn point.

280
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,900
So, our lovely city is gone to heck.

281
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh man, just to be a fish in these kinds of situations seems
so...

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,460
Rapture is dead.

283
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,940
What happened here?

284
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,100
We're not your property.

285
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,700
Let...

286
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,280
I

287
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,740
need a weapon.

288
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,360
I'm so scared.

289
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,340
Ryan doesn't own us.

290
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,700
Screw Ryan.

291
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,020
I don't know that guy.

292
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,500
Let it end.

293
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,560
Let us ascend.

294
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,260
And then there's like business cards or something.

295
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,100
Attention, all bathysphere travel is now denied!

296
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,380
Rapture is dead.

297
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,340
Obscured.

298
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,400
Can't see anything.

299
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,580
Wait!

300
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,120
I can't see anything.

301
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,380
Holy cow.

302
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,980
Just a bit further.

303
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,160
How do you like that, sister?

304
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,200
Welcome to Rapture!

305
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,360
Oh yeah, fighting drone.

306
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,660
A crowbar.

307
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,820
Like this?

308
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,760
A wrench?

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
Oh yeah.

310
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,000
Oh, oops.

311
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,020
Yeah, baby.

312
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,500
Where am I supposed to even go?

313
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,920
What is that?

314
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,780
Rapture, Transit, Authority Station?

315
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,520
Cool.

316
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,780
Um...

317
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,200
Oh.

318
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,940
Is it coming at me?

319
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,060
Or...

320
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,880
Very slowly.

321
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,620
It's coming at me very slowly.

322
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,680
Ayya!

323
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,240
Are you evil or...

324
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,420
Oh!

325
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,120
Oh!

326
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,280
Oh!

327
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,320
Oh!

328
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,760
Oh!

329
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,680
Are you okay?

330
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,200
I got him.

331
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,840
Yeah, it was self-defense.

332
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,680
You got first aid when hurt, press F to heal.

333
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,260
Whoa.

334
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,350
How does this survive?

335
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,370
How does all this wood like last under all this pressure in
the water, right?

336
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,110
F and D.

337
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,550
chat.

338
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,670
Yeah, FN chat.

339
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,210
Potato chips.

340
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,090
Can I like, not take them?

341
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,190
Or can I not eat them?

342
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,770
Can I like just hold on to them?

343
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,350
I guess not.

344
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,270
One man's vision.

345
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,170
Mankind's salvation.

346
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,270
It auto-eats.

347
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,670
Dang.

348
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,070
Okay.

349
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,770
I'll have to save stuff then.

350
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,270
Wow!

351
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,970
I can't get over.

352
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,710
It's so cool.

353
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,690
Plasmids.

354
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,990
Okay, I'm gonna get superpowers.

355
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,170
Or something.

356
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,930
Pick your plasmids and evolve.

357
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,900
He is hungry.

358
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,100
He's too hungry, right?

359
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,520
Sorry, I'm like looking around because it's so cool looking.

360
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,380
Gatherers, garden.

361
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh!

362
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,280
Power up.

363
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:58,630
Ugh.

364
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:00,610
Ugh!

365
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:00,690
Ugh!

366
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,510
What are these tattoos?

367
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,230
We got like chains on our wrists.

368
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,850
I'm okay.

369
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,630
I'm taking this really well.

370
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:19,830
Oh,

371
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,590
they're talking, but I don't hear anything.

372
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,850
This little fish looks like he just had his cherry popped.

373
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,310
Wonder if he still got some Adam on him.

374
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,430
Adam.

375
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,520
The audio is like delayed.

376
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,720
Either.

377
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,340
Let's bug.

378
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,220
Weak.

379
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,520
You're a weak chopper.

380
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,480
And is there a fish I will have towing it without Big Daddy?

381
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,820
Big Daddy!

382
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:54,900
Uh-oh.

383
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,500
Wait.

384
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,060
You'll be no better off with Metal Daddy, little fish.

385
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,080
See you floating on my...

386
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,760
Wait, Big Daddy's a bad guy!

387
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,840
I thought I was gonna be Big Daddy!

388
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:04,960
Wait!

389
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,790
I wanted to be Big Daddy!

390
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:16,690
Oh!

391
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:17,850
Little sister!

392
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,390
Look, Mr. Bubbles.

393
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,770
It's an angel.

394
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,250
I can see light coming from his belly.

395
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,490
Wait a minute.

396
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,970
He's still breathing.

397
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,970
It's alright.

398
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,710
I know he'll be an angel soon.

399
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,610
Oh, creepy.

400
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,390
Whoa!

401
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,010
Have a baby, Henry.

402
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,910
First time, Plasma is a real kick from a mule.

403
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,990
But there's nothing like a fistful lightning now, is there?

404
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,250
What if I just open this door?

405
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,590
Door control.

406
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,770
So I can electric bolt now?

407
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,570
Zap it.

408
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,170
Oh, I really can!

409
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,590
Whoa!

410
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,450
Wait, was there anything else up here?

411
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,390
What about my wrench?

412
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:23,770
Oh!

413
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,010
Okay.

414
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:28,870
Very nice.

415
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,950
Is there anything else up here?

416
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,910
Can I get another...

417
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,530
This looks like...

418
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,270
Little sister, no?

419
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,470
Almost the same outfit and everything.

420
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,880
Trash can.

421
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh!

422
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,160
Okay, so you do want to be... See?

423
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,640
Exploring pace.

424
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,060
Exploring pace.

425
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,880
Alright, cool.

426
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,540
Let's go through.

427
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,220
Wait!

428
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,860
in this?

429
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,760
Oh, N-N-N-Num-Numotube!

430
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,800
Nothing.

431
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,410
Oh,

432
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,570
that's no good.

433
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:26,390
Oh!

434
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:27,570
Oh, that's no good.

435
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:29,850
Uh...

436
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:34,370
Am I gonna get shocked or... Because it's, you know...

437
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,310
If I... If I use, um...

438
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,630
Electricity in the water?

439
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,810
Uh, this isn't good.

440
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,370
Oh, I pressed shift, and I don't think I was supposed to do
that.

441
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,550
Oh, oh, let's just keep going.

442
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,990
Oh, oh, that's no good.

443
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,150
And close.

444
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,170
All right, we should be safe now.

445
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,870
Oh, wait, this place is flooded too.

446
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,070
Oh, that's no good.

447
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,080
Was that me, or did someone do the...

448
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,990
Zap him and whack him.

449
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,270
Two punch.

450
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,860
Where are they?

451
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,610
Uh.

452
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,730
Zap them.

453
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,510
And whack them.

454
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,610
Where are they?

455
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,700
Wait, what was that?

456
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,560
Oh.

457
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,860
An Arcadia Merlot.

458
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,840
Health gained but lost E from drinking.

459
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,620
I can smoke cigarettes even!

460
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,640
I'm just going crazy.

461
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,040
Oh, my eyes.

462
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,060
Oh,

463
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,120
sorry.

464
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,060
You all, you...

465
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,200
All this guy asked was for me to leave him alone.

466
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,220
What's going on?

467
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm trying to...

468
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,880
Oh, shoot.

469
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,040
I think we gotta go up.

470
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,600
I'm

471
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,620
not even...

472
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,460
getting time to explore these guys.

473
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,400
Man, I'm fired.

474
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,960
Hold on, let's go back to this guy.

475
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm taking everything.

476
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,640
What is...

477
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,080
Oh, this is the chamber.

478
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,780
Okay, okay.

479
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,540
There's so much stuff.

480
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:19,820
Hello.

481
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,380
Let me explore...

482
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Oh, no!

483
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
It didn't beat the... I thought I was searching.

484
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,040
I thought I was searching him.

485
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,230
Loot everything.

486
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,270
That's what I'm trying to do.

487
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:31,770
Yeah.

488
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,460
Where is this coming from?

489
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:42,670
Independence.

490
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,970
Where is it coming from?

491
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,490
Up there?

492
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,550
Oh, oh he opened the door.

493
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,330
Or something opened the door.

494
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:51,990
Maybe I didn't.

495
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:52,910
Maybe it's motion action.

496
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,350
Oh, yeah.

497
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:55,870
It's B.

498
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,770
So this seems the elevator works.

499
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,490
Or it doesn't.

500
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,570
Uh, pardon our dust.

501
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,680
Okay, let's go ahead.

502
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,060
Might not be a great idea using it, but here we go.

503
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,600
If you can reach them in Neptune's bounty, then maybe just
maybe.

504
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,220
There he is.

505
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,810
Yeah, what the hell is going?

506
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,050

Revolve.

Can I switch?

Okay, good.

518
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,320
We can switch.

Oh, I do what I want.

00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,200
Wow.

Happy New Year, 1959.

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,540
Let's go, baby.

530
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,380
Do you like naturally regen the plasma or do you have to get
items for it?

531
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,560
Okay.

532
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,360
That's a whiskey.

533
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,120
Oh no!

534
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,740
Only items.

535
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,240
I think I was thinking of Donny Darko with these masks.

536
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,300
Oh, there's definitely...

537
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,800
Oh my gosh, this is a little spooky, no?

538
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,440
Oh, it's so spooky actually.

539
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,340
Money?

540
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,000
Cash money?

541
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,230
Oh.

542
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,570
Oh.

543
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:26,950
Oh.

544
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,510
Whoa, what's happening with my vision?

545
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,570
Did you guys see that?

546
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,350
Wait, why?

547
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,920
Agosta!

548
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:54,470
I can use the sink.

549
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,210
Making sure I'm not gonna get ambushed in there.

550
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,330
We'll have diarrhea.

551
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,210
Wait, what?

552
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,430
Hey, Brenda.

553
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,770
You care to tell me why you've had a hole in the red?

554
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,910
The eyes of Plymouth Rock coming out of your crapper going
on three weeks now.

555
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,930
I ain't saying I'm Shakespeare.

556
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,010
I'm trying to run a respectable theater.

557
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,070
I got work and food coming in for me.

558
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:15,730
Ah!

559
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:15,950
Shit!

560
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,570
Oh my god, you scared me.

561
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,590
You must have heard me use the bathroom!

562
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,720
Why don't they have the doors on them?

563
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,400
Oh, wait.

564
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,100
Okay, hold on.

565
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,720
Wait, let's go get this guy first.

566
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,640
Did I just see a shadow go by?

567
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,140
Am I crazy?

568
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,740
Horror games that are not horror games, my favorite genre.

569
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,040
No, right.

570
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,020
Yo, open up.

571
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,080
Don't be dramatic.

572
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,800
Oh, Charlie, where are you going?

573
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:09,800
Oh, shoot.

574
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,520
Oh, she's strong.

575
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,960
Oh, she's strong.

576
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,960
Bed?

577
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,040
Bed splice.

578
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,660
Wait, oh, there's so many places to explore.

579
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,440
Okay, hold on.

580
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,000
Music got a little funky.

581
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,520
Oh, where's our toads?

582
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,460
What was that?

583
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,880
Sometimes it's hard to like...

584
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,540
Oh, okay.

585
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,000
Vodka.

586
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh my gosh.

587
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,560
Sometimes it's hard to see, like...

588
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,800
Or like you try to hover over something, isn't it?

589
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,480
Charlie!

590
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,220
I wish I could go any faster.

591
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,700
though.

592
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,420
I feel like I'm really slow.

593
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,820
If I press shift, it opens up that menu.

594
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,340
More money, baby.

595
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
Mr. Jai.

596
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,360
I just used one, but that's okay, actually.

597
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,640
Let's go, Diane.

598
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,060
Girl enraps her.

599
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,140
Silly enough to fall in love with Andrew Ryan.

600
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,280
Oh, I see control.

601
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,320
Yeah, okay.

602
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,180
It does make us faster, for sure.

603
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,290
Oops, I didn't mean to eat it.

604
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,410
Wait, I just realized.

605
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,250
But, Andrew Ryan had so many suitors.

606
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,760
Wait, I didn't...

607
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,560
Oh, I ate it.

608
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,160
I ate it.

609
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,440
Cigarettes.

610
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,920
Nico time.

611
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,720
Nico Nico time.

612
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,040
Health lost, but Eve gained.

613
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,740
Alright, so the alcohol...

614
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,740
Alcohol takes your...

615
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,660
I bet this probably all goes to the same place.

616
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,740
But alcohol takes your health...

617
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,820
No, takes your Eve, but gives you health, and then...

618
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,040
For

619
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,140
a minute.

620
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:52,960
Why?

621
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:00,950
Is that her?

622
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,630
Oh, what does she do?

623
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,110
What are you doing?

624
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,400
Little sister.

625
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,880
Somebody went and turned a sweet baby girl into

626
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,550
a wheel of rapture turning.

627
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,290
Everybody wants us.

628
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,730
Everybody needs us.

629
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,730
Am I gonna be okay?

630
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,950
Like, I now have this stuff in me too.

631
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,380
How much are you gonna stick that in there?

632
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,640
How much are you gonna poke him?

633
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,340
How much are you gonna poke him?

634
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,040
I want to jump down there so bad.

635
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,460
I'll be fine, probably.

636
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,760
You think so?

637
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,740
I want to see what happens.

638
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,120
Oh, wait.

639
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,840
I'm going down.

640
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,520
Oh, shoot.

641
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,900
Wait, maybe I'm scared now.

642
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,860
Maybe I'm scared.

643
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,280
No.

644
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,400
Oh!

645
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:55,750
I was gonna say you're gonna anger you're gonna anger him

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,040
We're going where he went.

649
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,900
That's barely cool.

650
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,200
Oh, we can save our game.

651
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,020
So happy.

652
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,840
Let us new save you.

653
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,160
She went with daddy.

654
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,380
You can save any time.

655
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,080
Okay, awesome.

656
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,420
Oh, we're I'm totally just gonna follow him.

657
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,160
That's really good.

658
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,380
Ooh!

659
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,470
Gained health from cake.

660
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,720
Let's go in here.

661
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,540
Let's, um, anything in here?

662
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,460
You got anything?

663
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,420
You got some cash money, baby?

664
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,360
What about you?

665
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,560
Oh, yeah.

666
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,360
I keep giving me pistol?

667
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:25,800
Emo!

668
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:25,980
Oh!

669
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,260
Pew pew.

670
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,410
Is there like a way to block in this or not?

671
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,760
Oh!

672
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,260
Oh!

673
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,300
I just got the pistol!

674
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,600
No.

675
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,200
Okay.

676
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,080
Oh my goodness.

677
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,760
All right, yeah.

678
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,840
Six shots.

679
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,280
Shock an enemy in the water.

680
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,760
Oh, there were two of them.

681
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,100
See, that's what I was saying.

682
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,620
I don't think I should use the electric.

683
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,260
In the water, right?

684
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,720
Okay, I'm glad that my assumption seem to be correct.

685
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,040
Pick your plasma and evolve.

686
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,420
What's gonna happen to me?

687
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,160
Come bite the apple!

688
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,640
Ooh, la la.

689
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,060
Did I get this guy?

690
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Oh, I think I did, yeah.

691
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,980
Double kill.

692
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,060
Some cash money.

693
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,620
Big daddy.

694
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,480
Oh, big daddy's got big money!

695
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,500
Okay.

696
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:21,820
Okay.

697
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,900
What do you mean I'm easy?

698
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,520
Okay, I'm gonna pause.

699
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,560
Let's see.

700
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,840
Oh, that's an auto-save.

701
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,820
Alright, let's save.

702
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,520
Alright.

703
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,220
Booy!

704
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,100
Oh, I just saw it!

705
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,880
Oopsie.

706
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:44,800
Okay.

707
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,740
Um...

708
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,680
Good morning, Rapture!

709
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,820
Why would you name it this?

710
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,840
Why would you name your civilization rapture?

711
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,000
Then we have this area.

712
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,420
Oh, oh yeah, that's right.

713
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,480
I have to follow the arrow now, don't I?

714
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,610
Anyone in here?

715
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:10,890
Oh.

716
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,410
I can't carry any more first aid kits.

717
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,510
Okay, so I can only carry up to nine?

718
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,820
Isn't it from the Bible?

719
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,480
Yeah, but it's just like...

720
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,120
when everybody

721
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,080
goes to heaven?

722
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,980
Am I in the gents area now?

723
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,260
We shine shoes.

724
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,580
Wait, why are they connected?

725
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,480
I'm sorry.

726
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,840
Oh, the wall crumbled.

727
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,160
I suppose.

728
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,700
Yeah, everybody ascends.

729
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,280
Oh.

730
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:02,620
Ah!

731
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:03,360
Ah!

732
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,080
Ah!

733
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,300
Hello?

734
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,340
Oh, shoot.

735
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,090
Where'd the other person go?

736
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,730
I thought I saw one more.

737
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,190
Oh, you.

738
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:26,470
Yeah.

739
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,910
I got him while they were in the water.

740
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,330
Um, hello?

741
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,770
That doesn't sound good.

742
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,270
Jump on in.

743
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,510
The water's fine.

744
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,770
They're all jumping in.

745
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,050
Oh, Andrew Ryan is still alive.

746
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,010
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

747
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,010
How do I redo this?

748
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,750
My vision.

749
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,250
How do I inject myself again?

750
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,270
R?

751
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:25,990
So tell me, friend, which one of the bitches It's automatic.

752
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:26,450
Okay.

753
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:27,850
I'll just wait then.

754
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,890
Here's the news.

755
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:35,030
Rapture isn't some sunken ship for you to plunder.

756
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:42,290
And And Lurion isn't a giddy socialite for me slapped around
by the government's model.

757
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,730
And with that, farewell or, thus Lovana and the Jedi.

758
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:48,830
Hmm?

759
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,330
I think your place is pretty...

760
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:54,410
...

761
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,210
Oh, shoot!

762
00:53:58,550 --> 00:53:58,850
Uh-oh.

763
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,670
I think I'm in trouble.

764
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:04,970
I think I'm in trouble.

765
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,170
Oh, you lose!

766
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,410
I didn't have to do anything.

767
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:17,870
Oh, there is a map.

768
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,450
Okay, awesome.

769
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,690
You get a hint.

770
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:20,290
Lucky.

771
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,110
Okay, so far, I don't know why this game is making me so
jumpy.

772
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,310
I guess it's because I'm, like, playing a type of game that
I'm not...

773
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,510
Quite used to, you know?

774
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,390
I don't play FPSs very often, so...

775
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,650
It's a bit spooky.

776
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,830
Yeah, it's pretty spooky now.

777
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,850
So if I... Oh, what the heck is that?

778
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,610
Oh, it's a vending machine!

779
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:53,570
Oh, okay.

780
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,170
Oh, whoa!

781
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,390
Oh, spoilers?

782
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:59,330
Spoilers?

783
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,010
Spoilers?

784
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:06,370
Wait, wait, what is my active goal?

785
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:19,310
The past free will and free man.

786
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,790
I'm hearing somebody speak.

787
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,690
Oh, I could purchase stuff!

788
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:26,630
Oh!

789
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,310
Okay, for now we'll hold off.

790
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,870
Yeah, I'll hold off for now.

791
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:38,970
What?

792
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:42,270
Probably hearing people upstairs is probably what's going
on.

793
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:45,860
Diary.

794
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,300
It's right there!

795
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,120
It's right there!

796
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:53,480
Yes!

797
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,940
Oh, that's right.

798
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:02,820
He told me that once the scar tissue was gone, he was gonna
fix me right up.

799
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,880
Make me prettier than any girl I've ever seen.

800
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,400
Uh-huh.

801
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,340
Oh, it's Diane again!

802
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,900
Also, I just noticed our The compass is gone.

803
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,000
Beaten by a nose?

804
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,760
Steinman's?

805
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,060
Offers a comprehensive rhinoplasty service.

806
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,850
I love robbing the dead.

807
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,590
Alright, let's go.

808
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:45,970
Or...

809
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:46,450
not.

810
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:49,930
Never mind.

811
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:50,570
Oh.

812
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,370
Use that up.

813
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,470
Do you?

814
00:56:58,030 --> 00:56:58,830
Okay, hold on.

815
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:00,630
Oh, no.

816
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:01,870
Wait, I was looking at the map.

817
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,510
Okay, okay.

818
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,750
So it's a puzzle of some sort.

819
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:15,010
You are so noisy up there.

820
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:23,970
Do I like...

821
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,570
Do I...

822
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,130
Uh-huh.

823
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:28,410
Let me see.

824
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,390
Well, these are moving.

825
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,570
Wait, hold on.

826
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,490
Maybe I...

827
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,750
Oh, oh, oh, I'm hacking.

828
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:41,930
Wait, I'm searching.

829
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,770
I'm looting and then I'm hacking.

830
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:44,310
Wait.

831
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,190
Hacked security bots are friendly and will attack your
enemies.

832
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,410
Why are you live again already?

833
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:55,670
Do you know what sleep is?

834
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,830
What are you talking about?

835
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,370
I was live so long ago.

836
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:04,310
Okay, what are we doing?

837
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:05,750
Oh.

838
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,390
Reveal tiles.

839
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:14,090
find pipe segments by revealing hidden tiles, swap pipes,
pick up pipes and swap them with another pipe to create a

840
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,090
connected line, make a chain to the exit pipe.

841
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,850
Guide the flow of the metallic liquid.

842
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,290
Looks like an ectoplasm.

843
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,950
Oh, so this is the exit here.

844
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:30,250
Okay.

845
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:35,970
Can I just unveil any one that I want?

846
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,410
You have limited time?

847
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:45,690
Oh, I see it!

848
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,430
Oh, I see it!

849
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:46,750
I see it!

850
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,070
Oh, shoot.

851
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,430
Okay.

852
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:54,630
We can make this work.

853
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:03,050
Okay, we'll just make it a long roundabout way of going, you
know?

854
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,150
Oh, wait.

855
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:09,330
There we go.

856
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,510
Wait, oh, shoot.

857
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,310
Wait, don't make it so high.

858
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,030
There, yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,230
And, uh...

860
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:22,810
Easy!

861
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,780
It started moving, so I got freaked out.

862
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,860
Wait, if I click finished?

863
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,340
Oh, yippee!

864
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,000
Okay.

865
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,080
If it works, it works, right?

866
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:35,960
Okay.

867
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,580
I performed at least one successful hack.

868
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,120
Hack successful!

869
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,740
Hack the security bots are friendly and I'm gonna attack
your enemies.

870
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,950
Are you gonna follow me or?

871
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:01,410
Sounds like a really annoying fly.

872
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:05,970
Holy!

873
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:15,970
Oh my goodness.

874
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,510
Maybe I need to switch to my gun too.

875
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,150
Where'd he go?

876
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:28,540
Oh, six shots.

877
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,240
Oh, he's got coffee.

878
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,100
I'll drink that.

879
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,740
Okay, I gotta get used to using a gun in this game, huh?

880
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,380
I should probably use a gun in this game, huh?

881
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,920
Adams changes.

882
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,020
Yes.

883
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:10,940
We could lop a boil here and shave down a beak there, but
could we really change anything?

884
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,840
Adam gives us the mean things to do it.

885
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:21,080
And Ryan frees us from the phony ethics that held us back.

886
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,940
Change your look, change your sex, change your race.

887
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,040
It's yours to change.

888
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,920
Nobody else is.

889
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,400
I've got to become a cat.

890
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,160
So I don't have to do any work.

891
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,140
Can I change my species, please?

892
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,610
Change your diapers.

893
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,030
This guy is bumping into everything.

894
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,050
He's so clumsy.

895
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:53,730
Um, I imagine if I turn this on, I'm gonna get...

896
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:54,910
Bump.

897
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,430
I'm gonna get...

898
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,950
Axe is denied!

899
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,310
If you want to use him, here's the Axeman's key.

900
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:08,990
Where is he?

901
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:10,490
He's the one that runs this place.

902
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,610
Well, I don't mind this.

903
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,390
Oh, okay.

904
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:16,710
The doyman ain't that kind.

905
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:19,690
And frankly, human.

906
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:22,850
I don't think anybody is, huh?

907
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,770
Get the key from stymond.

908
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:26,770
Oh, is that a new gun?

909
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,260
Oh my god!

910
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,220
I didn't realize it still had my gun.

911
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,380
I thought I was on my...

912
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:38,820
Oh my gosh.

913
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,120
Oh, a machine gun!

914
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,440
Oh, let's go.

915
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,320
This is the lady I've been hearing.

916
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,660
Get her gun for more bullets.

917
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,620
Where?

918
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:55,960
Come in.

919
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,640
This guy?

920
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,860
What are you doing?

921
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,580
All right, that's open now.

922
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,340
Back on this thing is crazy.

923
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,860
Wait, wait, wait.

924
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:27,880
We have rules here.

925
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,580
What are you talking about?

926
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,140
Wait, oh my gosh.

927
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:29,940
I'm trying to- there we go.

928
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,140
Let's get out of here.

929
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:45,570
Holy shit!

930
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:46,450
Holy shit!

931
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,570
Scared the hell out of me!

932
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,470
I

933
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,100
think I blew up my own droid.

934
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,200
Oh shoot.

935
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,240
Wait!

936
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:02,960
Oh!

937
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,640
Oh

938
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,430
my god, you're shooting at me too.

939
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:20,470
We're bonking?

940
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,570
Oh.

941
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:25,760
More gun.

942
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,900
Everybody's got cash money on them.

943
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,620
My drone!

944
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,940
I think I blew him up.

945
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,440
I think I ate it in him blowing up.

946
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,180
Is there any other buddy else?

947
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:48,250
My drone!

948
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:52,770
Plasmic ooze.

949
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,850
Before you know what you'll be as bright as rain.

950
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,650
Remember, a smart splicer is a happy splicer.

951
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,310
I wish that were me.

952
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,110
Yeah?

953
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:09,530
Gosh, I'm looting everything.

954
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,330
Oh, I miss him.

955
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,750
He was a little annoying, but I still miss him.

956
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:16,950
Hey, Jerome.

957
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:17,810
What the heck is this?

958
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:18,790
Alright.

959
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:19,890
Is this a door?

960
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:20,550
No.

961
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:25,470
Oh, it's a ghost.

962
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,210
Is this Diane?

963
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,290
Is that like the ghost of Diane?

964
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:38,850
Corpse.

965
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:39,290
Oh.

966
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,470
I don't even see him.

967
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,550
There's somebody speaking, but I can't hear.

968
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,090
I can't find them at all.

969
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,770
A brick of picnic lantern will make a day off.

970
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,630
You keep an ideal for Steinman.

971
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,910
The dark bastard set up shop in the surgery wing.

972
01:05:58,490 --> 01:05:59,630
That's ghost, too.

973
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,550
Oh, my bad.

974
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,310
Above all, do no harm.

975
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,910
Above all, do no harm, Steinman.

976
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,150
As he writes in blood.

977
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,150
Right.

978
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,010
Oh.

979
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:13,550
No!

980
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,670
I didn't mean to... I meant to press T.

981
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:17,810
My hands are... My fingers are too small!

982
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,070
As your tools and

983
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:30,670
happy enough to take off a water tube or turn a real circus
freak into something you can show in the daylight.

984
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:31,150
No!

985
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:32,410
That was then.

986
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,310
It's hard to reach.

987
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,810
It was pretty well.

988
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,250
That's true.

989
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:39,170
Until

990
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,660
the job is done.

991
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:48,460
Right.

992
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:49,720
Alright.

993
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,800
Definitely hear people around here.

994
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,540
I wish I had my drone.

995
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,180
I'm gonna switch to my gun.

996
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,160
Wait.

997
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:09,340
What?

998
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,380
Who was shooting at?

999
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,640
Holy cow.

1000
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:19,110
Who's shooting at me?

1001
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:42,000
If I can even get there, to them oh my god it's a turret

1007
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:44,710
I should probably...

1008
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,170
Oh, there we go.

1009
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:45,630
Oh!

1010
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:46,690
Oh no!

1011
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:53,580
Um...

1012
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,400
There we go.

1013
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:54,860
Okay.

1014
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,540
Yay!

1015
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:00,620
We have the turret!

1016
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:01,800
Foyled!

1017
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,120
Oh!

1018
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,020
Oh!

1019
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,200
And what is happening here?

1020
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,940
And what is happening here?

1021
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,680
Thank you, turret buddy.

1022
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,400
Oh.

1023
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,020
What is happening here?

1024
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,640
It's very distracting.

1025
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:28,800
I'll be honest.

1026
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:31,640
Oh.

1027
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,190
Was that him?

1028
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,590
It's pretty distracting.

1029
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:53,510
On the surface, the parasite expects the docks to heal them
for free.

1030
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,050
The farmer to feed them out of charity.

1031
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:01,010
How little they differ from the pervert who prowls the
streets looking for them.

1032
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,030
for a victim he can ravish for his grotesque amusement.

1033
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:07,110
It's

1034
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:16,070
fine.

1035
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:19,950
With Adam and my scalpel, I have been transformed.

1036
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,910
But is there not so much pattern?

1037
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:27,430
What if now it is not my skill that fails me?

1038
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,230
But my imagination.

1039
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:30,810
My imagination.

1040
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:33,530
Not the funeral home.

1041
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,550
Alright, let's look around a little bit more.

1042
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:42,850
She's really making her way over there.

1043
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,090
Did I loot this one?

1044
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:44,790
Oh!

1045
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,550
I got some smokes though.

1046
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:49,690
That lowered my health a little bit but...

1047
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:51,710
That's a-okay.

1048
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:52,790
What else do we got here?

1049
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:55,410
I saw something else.

1050
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,130
Glimmering over here?

1051
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:58,290
Oh.

1052
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,230
Hack the turret to make it your ally.

1053
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:01,790
Oh!

1054
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:18,390
Nice dodge, thank you.

1055
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:21,910
We're hacking?

1056
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:26,210
Holy cow.

1057
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,030
This is fun, though.

1058
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:27,930
I like these.

1059
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:40,760
Let's,

1060
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,790
uh...

1061
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,130
Yep.

1062
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,030
That should be good, right?

1063
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:56,290
Yippee!

1064
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,070
Is this the remastered version?

1065
01:11:59,190 --> 01:11:59,690
It is.

1066
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,970
It is the remastered version.

1067
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,510
These get so annoying in late game.

1068
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,030
Uh oh.

1069
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,490
I like them for now though.

1070
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,310
They're fun.

1071
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:17,050
What was that armor piercing pistol round?

1072
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,460
I hear some lady doing something.

1073
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:32,400
I like that once you search something, it doesn't allow you
to search it again so you don't like...

1074
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,160
You know what I mean?

1075
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,820
So you don't waste your time.

1076
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,720
Who's laughing?

1077
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,920
This game is scary!

1078
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,940
People are scary.

1079
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,060
Okay, let's keep going.

1080
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,220
I am supposed to go this way maybe?

1081
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,800
What is this?

1082
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,620
I can hack it.

1083
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,540
More items available, all prices reduced.

1084
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,500
Does this mean the difficulty?

1085
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:25,600
Yes.

1086
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,650
Do you guys think I can do it?

1087
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,100
Buy out with $88.

1088
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,480
Hack everything.

1089
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:35,660
If I...

1090
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,660
If a hack is not successful...

1091
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,200
Oh my gosh.

1092
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,240
Holy cow.

1093
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:39,640
Okay.

1094
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,660
Does it...

1095
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,580
Oh, it's fast.

1096
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:47,890
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1097
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,360
Oops, I messed it up.

1098
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,480
Okay.

1099
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,720
Oh, wow.

1100
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,800
Okay, I, like, really got hurt from that.

1101
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,220
Well, now I know.

1102
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:11,660
It has been brought to my attention that some citizens have
discovered ways to hack the vending machine.

1103
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,720
Circus of Valley.

1104
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:19,300
You do not need to remind each and every citizen of Rapture
that free enterprise is the foundation upon which our

1105
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,560
society has been established.

1106
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,700
Parasites will be punished.

1107
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,780
I don't know something about this guy that ain't all right.

1108
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,640
This one's also hard.

1109
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:34,700
I don't know.

1110
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:35,520
Do it again?

1111
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,560
I'm gonna die.

1112
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:37,740
How much is it?

1113
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,140
Welcome to the circus of value.

1114
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,500
Welcome to the circus of value.

1115
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,840
Welcome to the circus of value.

1116
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,620
Save scum it!

1117
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,500
Oh, can you?

1118
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,300
Hack everything.

1119
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,740
You can still buy from it if you fail.

1120
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,300
Yeah, but it hurts me!

1121
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,740
It's short circuit.

1122
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,680
Save scum?

1123
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:20,980
Okay.

1124
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,760
New save.

1125
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,480
We're safe scumming right now.

1126
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,580
Alright, I believe in this one.

1127
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,780
Oh, it's the same as before.

1128
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,480
As soon as I get something that...

1129
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,020
Here we go.

1130
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,120
Oh, wait.

1131
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,120
No, that's not good.

1132
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:40,920
Uh, shoot.

1133
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,060
You.

1134
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,240
And then...

1135
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,400
Oh my god, these are hard.

1136
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,680
Wait, these are really hard.

1137
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,320
These are really difficult.

1138
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:52,600
Okay.

1139
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,440
I saved this some time.

1140
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:57,600
Oh my gosh.

1141
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:58,460
Oh my god.

1142
01:15:58,980 --> 01:15:59,220
Oh my god.

1143
01:15:59,380 --> 01:15:59,720
Oh my god.

1144
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:00,960
Oh my god.

1145
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:01,800
Oh, I

1146
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:09,730
did it!

1147
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:13,190
Yeah!

1148
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:15,130
Woo!

1149
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,690
The stress!

1150
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,510
Holy cow.

1151
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,790
Welcome to the search.

1152
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,290
But we did it!

1153
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,970
We did it.

1154
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,730
Yeah, I didn't even need to save Scum.

1155
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:33,730
We're too good.

1156
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,490
We're too powerful.

1157
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,530
Okay, I will get some first aid.

1158
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:42,210
Actually, get some Eve.

1159
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,520
Have a single armor piercing round.

1160
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:59,360
They give you exactly six shots.

1161
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:00,620
Oh, scary.

1162
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,440
What's this?

1163
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,320
Shotgun.

1164
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:05,680
I like it.

1165
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,200
Hacked!

1166
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,140
Wait, so will this stay hacked?

1167
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,660
Okay.

1168
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,820
A gun with only one bullet.

1169
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,180
I have 10 bullets.

1170
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,620
Spoiler, yeah, get a shotgun.

1171
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,200
It stays?

1172
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,600
Oh, nice!

1173
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,260
This one stays hacked forever.

1174
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,320
I am gonna focus on now for health and stuff though.

1175
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,260
I think we'll hold off for now on anything else.

1176
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:39,800
Oh.

1177
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,680
I'm gonna save again though because I...

1178
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,240
Is this the one that...

1179
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:46,380
Wait.

1180
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,400
This is the one I just did, yeah.

1181
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,960
You need more bullets.

1182
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,560
I'll get them, I'll get them.

1183
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:01,540
Ship to choose weapon...

1184
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:02,520
Oh!

1185
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,840
Does it pause the game when I do that?

1186
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,900
What's up, my knee?

1187
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,460
Oh, it's...

1188
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,500
It does!

1189
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:17,620
Oh wait, that's awesome!

1190
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,140
For someone who panics like me, you know?

1191
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,260
What's this?

1192
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:24,840
I could heal!

1193
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,580
Oh, wow, okay.

1194
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,700
Is it one-time use?

1195
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,620
Wait, I think I just saw the guy go up to the other side.

1196
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,280
Oh, there he is.

1197
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,360
Everything can be hacked.

1198
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,920
Yeah, that's not my ass though.

1199
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,360
Let's try it.

1200
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,200
Let's hack it.

1201
01:18:59,460 --> 01:18:59,560
Oh!

1202
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,540
It's not even that difficult.

1203
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,380
Or so it says.

1204
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,490
What's like the best strat for these guys?

1205
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,760
Zigzag strat.

1206
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,660
Is that what I just did?

1207
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,960
Also now, heal is $10 instead.

1208
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,940
Does it give me a health pack or does it heal heal me?

1209
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,520
I don't want it to heal heal me.

1210
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:43,620
I don't need it right now.

1211
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,150
Eternal flame.

1212
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:53,750
Damn, they dangerous.

1213
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,620
Gabe's stressing me out.

1214
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,320
Whoa.

1215
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,500
Give me the shotgun, baby.

1216
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:16,880
There's a lot of places to search, but I'm realizing that
supplies feels rather limited.

1217
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,060
It heals, drops, and med pack if you break, but there's
no...

1218
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,380
Okay, no more station.

1219
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,120
Got it.

1220
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:27,640
Steimann.

1221
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,200
I know medical civilian is your matter.

1222
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,620
But you might want to cogitate on this.

1223
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,940
Ocean water is colder than a witch's tip.

1224
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,160
You don't heat the pipes, the pipes freeze.

1225
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,720
Pipes freeze, pipes burst, and then rapture leaks.

1226
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:49,220
Now, I realize you're a posh sort of geyser, and frankly, I
don't give a toss if you piss or go fishing.

1227
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:57,100
but once rapture starts leaking the old girl's never gonna
stop and then i'll be sure to tell ryan he's got you a thank

1228
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:05,300
you yeah it seems like you know building a whole society in
the water is kind of difficult

1229
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:23,520
hack only this machine must be hacked to access whoa Wait,
how difficult is it?

1230
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,500
I like the hacking, I'm not gonna lie.

1231
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,460
Oh my god, it's like so easy!

1232
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,180
Or so it says.

1233
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:36,620
Oh.

1234
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,680
Easy.

1235
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,420
Hack is fun.

1236
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,260
I like the hacking.

1237
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,180
It didn't make it any cheaper though.

1238
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,740
Although this one was still 19, I guess because you have the
haka to get it.

1239
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:05,760
Okay, anyway.

1240
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,620
Um, there was more stuff up here.

1241
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,800
Trying to explore.

1242
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,460
A rapture reminder.

1243
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:17,100
The bottom of the ocean is our home, but it can also be a
dangerous place.

1244
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,240
Okay, we went this way.

1245
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,820
Report any unexplained water prompted to the central
council.

1246
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:24,720
Am I supposed to go in there?

1247
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,060
Into Dr. Steinman's aesthetic ideals?

1248
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:29,560
Well, hold on.

1249
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,380
I'm still looking around.

1250
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:32,520
Oh!

1251
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:34,860
Yes!

1252
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,180
Whoa!

1253
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,960
Did he die?

1254
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:03,630
Where is he?

1255
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:04,190
Oh shoot.

1256
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:07,070
I'm trying to...

1257
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,810
There we go.

1258
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:09,750
Where did he?

1259
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:12,730
Oh shoot.

1260
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:12,750
I'm trying to...

1261
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,050
Where did he go?

1262
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:15,090
Where did he go?

1263
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:19,730
I think you went through there.

1264
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,670
Ah!

1265
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,110
Oh my god!

1266
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:25,770
Oh my gosh.

1267
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,220
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, stop!

1268
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,720
I should probably use a gun for that, but...

1269
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,680
I killed him, it's fine.

1270
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:38,960
Everything's fine.

1271
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,680
You can just buy more things.

1272
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:47,760
Why do you mean he used all his staking grenades?

1273
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,720
In loving memory.

1274
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,000
Oh, wait, this is not Andrew?

1275
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,720
Oh, they look the same.

1276
01:23:58,460 --> 01:23:59,280
the time, you know?

1277
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,980
Every guy had this haircut and this mustache.

1278
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,840
This is Winston.

1279
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,050
Yeah, it's the look of the era.

1280
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:18,190
Everybody looks like Adam's family.

1281
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:19,170
You know?

1282
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:20,390
What's his name?

1283
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:21,470
The husband.

1284
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,030
It is a very dapper look.

1285
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:27,190
It's very fun.

1286
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:28,210
Whoa.

1287
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:30,190
Surgery Picasso.

1288
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:32,510
Goumet!

1289
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,550
Yes, Gomez.

1290
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:44,430
When Picasso became bored of painting people, he started
representing them as cubes and other abstract forms.

1291
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:46,870
The world called him a genius.

1292
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:55,330
I've spent my entire surgical career creating the same tired
shapes over and over again.

1293
01:24:56,310 --> 01:25:00,530
The upturned nose, the cleft chin, the ample bosom.

1294
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:09,840
Whoa.

1295
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:13,740
Steinman.

1296
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,660
This is, like, more open world than I expected it to be.

1297
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,520
Well, not open world, you know what I mean?

1298
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:25,780
But, like, it's not, like, directing me to, like, one place.

1299
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,600
Like, I am able to, kind of explore a little bit.

1300
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,920
Yeah, a little less linear.

1301
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:32,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1302
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:43,950
What do I do about them?

1303
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:44,490
Zap them?

1304
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:45,510
Can I hack them?

1305
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:48,470
I'm not a good hacker.

1306
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,490
I'm hacking?

1307
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,390
I'm not hacking.

1308
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:03,070
I'm playing Metal Gear now.

1309
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,620
That's so funny!

1310
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,120
Nice!

1311
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,640
Wait, do I have any more?

1312
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,860
Oh, shoot.

1313
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,200
I have a single rat.

1314
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,260
Okay.

1315
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:42,960
These are delicious.

1316
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:46,340
Crouch.

1317
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:46,900
Yeah, yeah.

1318
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,400
I figured I needed to crouch to get in there.

1319
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,340
Lots of stuff around here, though.

1320
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,200
I'm still searching.

1321
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,200
Ooh, first aid kit.

1322
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,620
We'll take that for sure, for sure.

1323
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,480
Oh, why do I feel like there's going to be somebody in one
of these?

1324
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,440
Oh, what's that?

1325
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,320
Oh, machine gun rounds.

1326
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,300
Can I open these?

1327
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:05,560
No.

1328
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,820
I like hearing the water sounds.

1329
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,910
Alright.

1330
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:17,490
Why don't I get in the shotgun?

1331
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:22,230
Q or B to change the ammo type.

1332
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:22,950
Oh, thank you.

1333
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:24,790
Also, I'll take that.

1334
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,610
Oh, this is...

1335
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,950
The parasite wanders the whole.

1336
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:32,810
We rebuild our city in the dark and the dark.

1337
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:40,030
Uh-oh, wait, are they coming?

1338
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:41,090
Are they going to be...

1339
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:41,990
Is this ambush or?

1340
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:44,030
No?

1341
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:46,230
Oh my gosh, she scared me.

1342
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:50,310
Incinerate.

1343
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:53,250
New plasmid.

1344
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:53,890
Incinerate.

1345
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:54,550
Incineration.

1346
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:57,630
When it absolutely positively has to erupt in flames, don't
wait.

1347
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:58,470
Incinerate!

1348
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:01,270
Whoa!

1349
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:04,890
Set the objects and creatures on fire!

1350
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,190
Repeated use To increase the pain.

1351
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,730
Aegis, well, for that.

1352
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,020
Fire spreads.

1353
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,780
Oh, shoot.

1354
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,130
My bad.

1355
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:59,610
It sounded just like them.

1356
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:07,440
Oh, good.

1357
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:07,980
We can get out.

1358
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,180
How do I switch?

1359
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:11,640
Um.

1360
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,120
Okay, like so.

1361
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:15,480
Okay.

1362
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:17,240
Is it the same?

1363
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:17,860
Ah!

1364
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,980
Okay, okay, okay.

1365
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:22,860
Very cool.

1366
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,820
We'll switch right now to something that's a little less you
know.

1367
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,220
I think C to crouch.

1368
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,100
I don't know why, but it's like throwing me off so bad.

1369
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,280
because I keep wanting to hit, like, control.

1370
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,080
Well, that was fun.

1371
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,320
We got them so easily.

1372
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,740
Tasty potato chips.

1373
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,280
Really, really old design.

1374
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,260
No, that's okay.

1375
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,120
I'm going to save real quick, by the way.

1376
01:29:55,340 --> 01:30:02,580
One thing that I did, if you guys don't mind sometimes
telling me to save, because one thing I did here is that if

1377
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:03,160
the game...

1378
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,620
is to make multiple new saves because the game

1379
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,480
could crash.

1380
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,400
So, we have to do be a little bit of a save goblin, yeah.

1381
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,820
That's one thing I read when I was looking into I wasn't
wondering which one to play.

1382
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,360
Oh, good.

1383
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,080
We got to avoid the security camera.

1384
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:28,460
Awesome.

1385
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,920
But Yeah, I was wondering which one to play.

1386
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,240
The original or the remaster.

1387
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:39,740
Um.

1388
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:45,590
I like how it's like, choose which plasma you want.

1389
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:46,790
Thank you.

1390
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:47,710
Alright, did we go?

1391
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,260
I think my turret is going crazy, but...

1392
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,360
Did it get him?

1393
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,800
Or did it get got?

1394
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:13,810
I can melt ice too!

1395
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:15,710
With it?

1396
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:16,710
Good job!

1397
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:17,370
Good job!

1398
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:18,170
Who did you get?

1399
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:21,210
No, wait, who did you get?

1400
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:22,070
Huh?

1401
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:24,550
Tell the minister, I'll just have to wait.

1402
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:26,670
It's my daughter's wedding, not his.

1403
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:27,830
Is this lady okay?

1404
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:30,090
Or like, rather, was she...

1405
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,690
I'm just gonna assume nobody is normal here, right?

1406
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:34,870
Like everybody is kind of...

1407
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,890
It's a lost cause for everyone.

1408
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:39,810
Did I go in here?

1409
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:40,590
Oh, that's right, I couldn't.

1410
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:44,330
I don't think she's okay.

1411
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,460
Oh, I was like, wow, what's that above me?

1412
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,980
It's so far up in the water.

1413
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,620
It's dirt on the ceiling.

1414
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,520
It's dirt on the ceiling.

1415
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,060
Oh, look at the wheel.

1416
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,760
Look how cute she is.

1417
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:39,640
She's stomping along with him.

1418
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:49,790
Big daddy.

1419
01:32:52,530 --> 01:33:00,990
so what were they built what what is his purpose you know
like just uh

1420
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,920
are they going in circles or

1421
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:20,140
i'm saving because i'm scared i'm saving because i'm scared

1422
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:41,780
aesthetics are a moral imperative Steinman's aesthetic
ideals.

1423
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,380
We're in the circle.

1424
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,680
Why do you have two eyes?

1425
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,260
Is there some law that says we must?

1426
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,640
Two arms, two legs, two ears, two breasts.

1427
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:52,940
I don't know.

1428
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:57,080
I guess that's just how humans were made.

1429
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:04,980
Holy cow!

1430
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:10,160
You'll have to find some way to get through this, Georgie,
and Steinman.

1431
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:11,500
Chin up now.

1432
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,000
The Lord hates a quitter.

1433
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,180
Oh wait, oh, oh I forgot.

1434
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,840
You can hear that splicer sounding off.

1435
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:21,940
Explosives are hard to come by down here.

1436
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,740
Wait, oh, oh, oh, wait!

1437
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,500
Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

1438
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,100
Um, I can't move.

1439
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,780
My computer is like, it's switched to Japanese and now it's
typing.

1440
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:32,860
Wait, hold on.

1441
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,040
There.

1442
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:37,340
Oh.

1443
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:37,740
Oh.

1444
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,300
Okay.

1445
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,500
We should...

1446
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:39,680
Nope.

1447
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:49,920
Uh-oh.

1448
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:50,860
Uh-oh.

1449
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:52,280
Uh-oh.

1450
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,060
Wait, I can't turn it off.

1451
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:54,400
Wait.

1452
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,100
Is this a bit?

1453
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:00,720
Yeah?

1454
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,220
No.

1455
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:06,550
Okay, so the issue...

1456
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:07,490
Let me explain the issue.

1457
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,370
Because I know that Alt Shift works.

1458
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:14,590
Okay, so first of all, my mouse cannot, like, leave the...

1459
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:16,130
It's locked into the window, right?

1460
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:17,230
It's locked in.

1461
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:19,310
So that's the first issue.

1462
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:28,410
I can't go up to the taskbar and like click the click the
click the to go back to normal.

1463
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:34,310
But also, the second thing is if I alt.

1464
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:38,590
Oh, wait, I think I got it.

1465
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:43,990
Oh, oh, I was doing alt tab instead of alt shift.

1466
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:47,950
Anyway, it was a fine telekinesis.

1467
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:48,550
What am I doing?

1468
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:51,010
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

1469
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:53,410
Telekinesis plasmids.

1470
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,470
Oh, it's a thingy.

1471
01:35:58,190 --> 01:35:59,650
Anyway, um, we're fine now.

1472
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:00,910
Sorry for the scare.

1473
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:03,390
It scared me more than you, probably.

1474
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:08,730
Wait, where am I supposed to go from here?

1475
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:10,190
Actually.

1476
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:12,150
Nice.

1477
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:13,990
Okay.

1478
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,010
Okay.

1479
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:17,030
Oh, okay.

1480
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:19,770
Ah, another health station.

1481
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,610
Okay, I'm going to try and hack this one.

1482
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:26,810
Let's do it like that.

1483
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:27,930
And then like that.

1484
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:28,530
Oh.

1485
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:29,450
Oh.

1486
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,930
Oh, wait.

1487
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:31,630
Oh, shoot.

1488
01:36:32,490 --> 01:36:33,030
Like that.

1489
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:33,730
There we go.

1490
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:39,710
Oh, it's a good thing it wasn't a hardwood or else I would
have been dead already.

1491
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:42,550
Oh, no.

1492
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:44,450
You're throwing off my groove.

1493
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,950
There we go.

1494
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:48,650
There we go.

1495
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:52,550
Gotta find telekinesis.

1496
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,400
So now it's cheaper to heal?

1497
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,800
I'll let you look at that.

1498
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,480
Free plasmids, a dandy dental!

1499
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:09,560
Choose from slim down and telekinesis.

1500
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,100
What if I choose slim down?

1501
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:13,260
Oh my goodness.

1502
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,140
I'm in my skinny...

1503
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:16,380
Ballet a little light.

1504
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,900
At surgical savings, we'll happily work out an Portable
payment plan for any major procedure.

1505
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:25,300
Potentially terminal illnesses won't wait until payday.

1506
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,280
Should you?

1507
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:31,650
So I go through here?

1508
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:33,050
No.

1509
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:35,130
Still tell me.

1510
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:39,990
I'm ready to burn.

1511
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:45,350
That

1512
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:59,790
thing uses a lot of power now, doesn't it?

1513
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:02,110
There she goes.

1514
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:02,750
Bye-bye.

1515
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,240
I just used one, didn't I?

1516
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:08,850
Dang it.

1517
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,420
Someone be whistling.

1518
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:19,420
Creepy.

1519
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,460
Who's whistling?

1520
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:32,470
Creepy!

1521
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:36,170
One shot, Minto.

1522
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:37,750
Yeah, baby.

1523
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:42,990
Okay, I need to go probably through here.

1524
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,770
They sound so close, you know?

1525
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:53,490
Like when I hear them, they sound like right behind me.

1526
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:55,570
So it's freaking me out.

1527
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:57,910
Oh, I used the fire here.

1528
01:38:58,350 --> 01:38:58,710
Okay.

1529
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:12,560
Ah!

1530
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,680
You're on fire!

1531
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:18,860
Okay, he's dead.

1532
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:22,960
Help me find this patient.

1533
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:27,980
That's kind of them.

1534
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,640
They give that to you after you...

1535
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,620
They force you to use your magic and then...

1536
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:33,100
You're sorry.

1537
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,040
You're plasmid.

1538
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,000
That's a whole lot of bandages we just got.

1539
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:47,300
Oh!

1540
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,440
Shotgun.

1541
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,060
Plasmids are magic.

1542
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:56,060
Okay, I'm just going to keep calling it magic then.

1543
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,480
I'm so sorry I'm going to save scum because I'm scared.

1544
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:01,740
My magic.

1545
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,760
Anyone want to mess with me?

1546
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:11,140
Wait.

1547
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:12,060
Oh, I got them all.

1548
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:13,000
Nice.

1549
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,520
There's a couple rooms here.

1550
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:22,720
Where are we anyway?

1551
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,340
Oh, this is the goal!

1552
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,460
Gatherers garden.

1553
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:48,160

kind of force you to get the fire huh i don't know i don't

1556
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:04,880

01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:05,980
Ah!

1558
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,020
Oh,

1559
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,300
I thought I heard one more.

1560
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:29,340
Holy cow.

1561
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,460
Gives me a shotgun, doesn't use it.

1562
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:34,040
Just, you know.

1563
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,880
Just Minto things.

1564
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,320
That's so funny.

1565
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,680
Oh, I'll eat that.

1566
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,240
Ooh!

1567
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:55,340
Okay.

1568
01:41:56,460 --> 01:42:01,300
Well, it would revive me and I wouldn't have to do this all
over again, so that's pretty nice.

1569
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,860
Okay, um...

1570
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,220
Give me the cash.

1571
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,940
So I need to go to the dentistry.

1572
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:12,300
Wait.

1573
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,600
Oh, a health station!

1574
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:21,450
We got this.

1575
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:22,850
Uh...

1576
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:28,920
I feel like I'm recovering.

1577
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:30,300
dressing and how I do these.

1578
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,080
Oh.

1579
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:39,840
Oh, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
da da da-da.

1580
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,360
I'm still at work, but I hope the game is going strong.

1581
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:48,520
I'm having fun.

1582
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:49,640
I'm having fun.

1583
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:57,020
I'm worried, though, because I fear, you know, when I pick
up the game again next week, I fear that I'm going to be

1584
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:58,900
like, oh gosh, what are these controls again?

1585
01:42:58,940 --> 01:42:59,320
you know?

1586
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,520
So I feel like this might be a...

1587
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,660
Because I'm so not used to these kinds of games.

1588
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,100
I feel like maybe...

1589
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:09,740
I do this one a couple times a week.

1590
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,600
Rather than once a week.

1591
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,780
I need a minute to refresh for all the plasmids.

1592
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,200
Yeah, I feel like it.

1593
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,400
That's okay.

1594
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:31,110
Okay.

1595
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:35,900
Let's go explore.

1596
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,160
over here first.

1597
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,400
I kind of like this one because it shocks like it.

1598
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,920
No, I can't hack it.

1599
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,840
I can't hack it from here.

1600
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:58,440
Maybe I can crouch.

1601
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,660
Can it see me if I crouch?

1602
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:04,000
Ha ha ha ha.

1603
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,440
Oh, I can, I can, I can.

1604
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:08,920
Oh,

1605
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:17,160
go!

1606
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:18,600
Oh, go!

1607
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,120
Oh, shoot.

1608
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:24,540
I need a choppers key!

1609
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:25,480
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1610
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:25,960
I'm gonna die.

1611
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:26,460
I'm gonna die.

1612
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:28,540
Oh, my gosh.

1613
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,160
Asshole.

1614
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,540
Jump through the window.

1615
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:39,820
Can I?

1616
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,820
I mean, if I die, I regen right there.

1617
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:44,860
Oh, gosh.

1618
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,660
There's no way.

1619
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:47,740
There's no way.

1620
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,500
Hold on.

1621
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:59,040
Let's let's let's let's let it die again and then I'll zap
it and then I'll I'll attempt to go through the window

1622
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,420
Hey, okay, nope.

1623
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,110
I don't think so

1624
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,780
All right

1625
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:46,370
Oh, I just realized I had like so much Is

1626
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,020
that a turret right there

1627
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:13,950
Yeah, someone's having a real good time over there, huh?

1628
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:17,810
I can hack the safe.

1629
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:23,270
What the hell is this?

1630
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:25,710
Oh my god, wait.

1631
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:27,170
I'm gonna die.

1632
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:27,990
Oh, shoot.

1633
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,410
No, dang it!

1634
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:36,010
Let me try again.

1635
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:36,570
Let me try again.

1636
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:38,470
Wait, this one's...

1637
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,270
This one's so easy.

1638
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:44,710
I didn't get a piece that I could use until...

1639
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:45,430
Well, I guess...

1640
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:46,290
Okay, I'm fine.

1641
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:49,250
But, but, but, but.

1642
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,310
You and then...

1643
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:51,550
You?

1644
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:57,290
Okay, we'll just have to like really, uh...

1645
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:58,310
You know?

1646
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:03,030
I need another Huang's boy.

1647
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:03,730
There we go.

1648
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:04,950
Ah, I did it!

1649
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:11,940
Yahoo!

1650
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:21,390
I like the music.

1651
01:47:24,670 --> 01:47:26,550
What is it?

1652
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:27,370
I'm

1653
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:36,430
scared.

1654
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:42,350
Fantastic.

1655
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:44,090
Oh, this is the telekinesis.

1656
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:48,910
What's gonna happen to me?

1657
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:07,130
I keep adding new plasmids, I'm gonna become as crazy as
these guys.

1658
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:12,230
Oh, it's tennis!

1659
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:17,830
Problem not with plasmid, problem with reaction time.

1660
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:21,530
Oh, yeah, that's gonna be me.

1661
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,780
You have run out of slots and have have to replace a
plasmid.

1662
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:35,680
You can buy more slots at Gatherer's Garden.

1663
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:40,180
Replace plasmids can be re-equipped at a gene bank.

1664
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:42,400
No!

1665
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,120
Wait.

1666
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,360
Can I leave?

1667
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,740
Oh, I can't.

1668
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:53,460
Because there was a garden around here, I thought.

1669
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:54,240
Oh, dang.

1670
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:56,360
You're already a bit loony.

1671
01:48:56,380 --> 01:49:09,420
This poor dude, I, you know, at the moment, I don't know
anything, so I'm assuming that our plane crashed, and we did

1672
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:12,480
not have any intention of being involved in all of this.

1673
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,980
I wanted to keep all of mine that I have right now.

1674
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:33,540
Right now, though, probably I feel like the electricity is
best because it also gets rid of machines so we'll keep the

1675
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:40,760
electricity and we will um get rid of the fire and

1676
01:49:54,520 --> 01:50:05,140
catch grenades and throw them back that's not a grenade why
are people throwing grenades why are people throwing

1677
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:18,500
grenades hold left okay hold left to grab release Release
left click to throw or press B to drop.

1678
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,500
Hold left to catch grenades.

1679
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,480
Oh.

1680
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:37,890
Ooh, my vision gets really funky here though.

1681
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,590
Oh my god, my vision though.

1682
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:48,410
Okay, I'm seeing how...

1683
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:49,370
Okay, I don't want to keep...

1684
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:49,650
You know.

1685
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:57,840
Electric fuck.

1686
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,580
Throwing grenades is generally more healthy than holding on
to them.

1687
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:05,760
I suppose that's correct.

1688
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,820
I suppose that could be a good argument, right?

1689
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,680
Oh, shoot.

1690
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:22,700
Anyone else?

1691
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,740
They all came out here.

1692
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,940
Useless experience.

1693
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:46,560
At the German prison camp, they put me to work on genetic
experiments on other prisoners.

1694
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,500
They call me Das Wunderkind.

1695
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,880
Das Wunderkind.

1696
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,020
Germans.

1697
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:56,880
All they can talk about is blue eyes and the shape of
forehead.

1698
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:02,160
All I care about is, why is this one born strong and that
one weak?

1699
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,800
This one's smart, that one's stupid.

1700
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,260
All that killing.

1701
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,300
You think the Germans could have been interested in
something useful?

1702
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:13,300
Whoa.

1703
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:25,160
Was the corpse always like this with the stuff stuck in it?

1704
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,380
Like that, good, golly.

1705
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:28,060
All right.

1706
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,260
Oh, what's this?

1707
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,080
Oh, nice.

1708
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,120
I didn't notice that at all.

1709
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:36,560
Oh, what's in here?

1710
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,070
And

1711
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,080
I telekinesis that?

1712
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:14,960
I'm a little trapped though.

1713
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,020
What is that?

1714
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:27,720
Oops.

1715
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,860
There's like a shadow of a corpse on the ceiling, it looks
like.

1716
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:52,450
I think I got it.

1717
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,700
Can't carry anymore.

1718
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,420
Actually, uh...

1719
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:08,340
There we go.

1720
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:14,150
Money, money, money.

1721
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:14,970
What's that?

1722
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:15,930
Oh, nice.

1723
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:19,830
Look at, we could search the turret even.

1724
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,950
What?

1725
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:25,390
I'm collecting bandages, but do...

1726
01:54:25,390 --> 01:54:27,270
Wait, are those used automatically?

1727
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:32,390
I just realized, because I've been collecting them.

1728
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:34,550
It says collected at least.

1729
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:37,870
Oh, they're like food.

1730
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:38,610
Okay, okay.

1731
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:39,350
Good to know.

1732
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:48,690
It doesn't say that I need to go this way, but...

1733
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:57,880
Oh!

1734
01:54:58,500 --> 01:54:58,640
Oh!

1735
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:03,620
Wait, I'm trying to grab that.

1736
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:04,860
Wait, actually, I can't.

1737
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:05,920
Wait, oh, thank you.

1738
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:07,820
Where am I?

1739
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,260
Oh, wait.

1740
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:19,700
in here sorry that the lights are kind of like crazy in this
sometimes there's so much to search oh i just clicked i just

1741
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:30,920
did the bandages again wrench jockey combat tonics that's
what this is i thought it was going to be like a like a

1742
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:33,380
permanent upgrade to my health or something

1743
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:53,660
sorry jockey bulks up your upper body allowing you to wield
club-like weapons with unprecedented skill and power

1744
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:02,280
compact tonics make you better at dealing and resisting
damage they're equipped separately from plasmas and other

1745
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:10,040
types of tonics more wrench damage I'm a fan.

1746
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,600
I'm a fan.

1747
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:18,820
Now look at this.

1748
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:21,820
I wasn't

1749
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:31,150
sure if she was dying in the water or not, so I just took
care of it.

1750
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:38,010
I wasn't sure if it was, you know.

1751
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:42,570
Oh,

1752
01:56:45,610 --> 01:56:46,470
there's a security kit.

1753
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:47,530
That's what that is.

1754
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,730
Oh, that was a whiskey.

1755
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:53,390
Oh, I don't think I should have wanted that, huh?

1756
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,220
Okay, it does look this way.

1757
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:07,340
Clinical trial, lot 44, Dr. Su Chong.

1758
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,300
Client Fontaine Kitturistics.

1759
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:13,800
Subject is white male, one Roland Wallace.

1760
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,660
Can you hear me, Mr. Wallace?

1761
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,440
Yes, sir, Mr. Su Chong, sir.

1762
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,140
Very well.

1763
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,580
Right, I'm introducing lot 44.

1764
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:37,440
I wonder what's over here.

1765
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:38,380
I'm just going to look.

1766
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:43,910
What is that?

1767
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:46,610
Oh, I hate the water effect.

1768
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:47,570
It's so terrible.

1769
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:50,630
Yeah, rip that guy.

1770
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:56,450
Oh,

1771
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:05,950
no!

1772
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:08,590
This guy's tough.

1773
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:10,470
I don't know if we can do it, guys.

1774
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,550
It's already tougher.

1775
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:21,920
Save scum?

1776
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,880
You're right.

1777
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:30,760
You're so right.

1778
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,400
Pack up.

1779
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:36,160
Oh, shoot.

1780
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:36,860
Oh, shoot.

1781
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:39,200
Oh, uh...

1782
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:40,920
Oh, uh, it's not gonna work.

1783
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,980
No, I'm already dead.

1784
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,520
That was tough.

1785
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,140
I don't even know if this is...

1786
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,220
I don't even know if I have the skills to do this.

1787
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,740
I don't have the brain capacity, I think.

1788
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:16,140
I don't know if I...

1789
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,580
How a practice run?

1790
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:21,580
You got this?

1791
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:23,040
No,

1792
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:41,690
it's not giving me what I need!

1793
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:48,280
Oh, I got it!

1794
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,180
Oh my gosh, I got it!

1795
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:51,840
I got it!

1796
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:52,500
Okay, okay.

1797
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:54,600
Oh, okay, okay.

1798
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:56,680
Oh, okay, okay.

1799
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:04,310
Eve hypo.

1800
02:00:05,290 --> 02:00:05,890
All right, let's run.

1801
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:18,350
hide from security camera you have hidden from security
camera okay I'm just hiding in here in case somebody runs

1802
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:23,010
after me if they didn't want you saves coming the devs
wouldn't have implemented saving at save points only that's

1803
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:26,770
so true I agree with that in fact I'm gonna save over that
too

1804
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:37,770
save you can hack security cameras too oh you can okay good
to know

1805
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:45,010
Well, I think we've done everything in here that we need to
anyway.

1806
02:00:46,610 --> 02:00:48,350
Today we came 32 years old!

1807
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:50,150
JFC, happy birthday!

1808
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:55,310
Thanks to your goofiness, cool tasting games, give me great
moments.

1809
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:58,330
Last year was harsh on me, I'm finally better so much.

1810
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,710
Oh, thanks so much for everything so far!

1811
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:01,610
Thank you!

1812
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:03,090
Happy birthday!

1813
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:06,270
Happy, happy birthday!

1814
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:15,470
Oh, there is something shiny under there.

1815
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:19,670
Wait.

1816
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,210
I got it.

1817
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:26,110
All right.

1818
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:33,930
What

1819
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:39,580
were you saying?

1820
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,520
Okay, so this way is the death.

1821
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:48,020
we still need the key um

1822
02:01:53,520 --> 02:02:03,500
michael this map i'm sorry it doesn't help me at all i get
so confused by it

1823
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:12,110
wasn't i just in here i didn't see the gatherers garden

1824
02:02:15,450 --> 02:02:22,090
the map in this game sucks i can't follow it like at all so
okay i think this is like below floor right and then this is

1825
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:26,730
the above floor so because we because i went downstairs
through the

1826
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:48,250

Okay, okay.

02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,500

1835
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:35,040
Okay, okay.

1836
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,080

The circus of values!

02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:51,870
What is the greatest lie ever?

1842
02:04:53,590 --> 02:04:58,230
What is the most vicious obscenity ever perpetrated on
mankind?

1843
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:01,770
You think Big Dottie's still in there?

1844
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:06,990
Oh, I hear her talking.

1845
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:10,870
Angel, she said.

1846
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:15,300
Goodness, you're so cute!

1847
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,340

Lily Poppy!

1849
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:31,090
And living there is the Lily Poppy!

1850
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:32,330
Thank you, Mr. Bee.

1851
02:05:34,530 --> 02:05:37,230
Time for Betty Pie, Mr. Bee.

1852
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:39,750
Mr. Bee is so cute.

1853
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:44,110
Betty Pie.

1854
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:51,000
Alright.

1855
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,600
Wait.

1856
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:55,100
Let's save real quick.

1857
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,200
I'm saving coming again.

1858
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:57,720
Mr.

1859
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:02,320
Bubbles.

1860
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,840
So you're gonna throw more of them?

1861
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:33,710
Oh, dang it.

1862
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:40,890
I can't, I don't think I can get him though.

1863
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:46,120
Can I?

1864
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:48,640
Maybe I can.

1865
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:53,220
Ah!

1866
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:56,180
Oh, oh!

1867
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:13,000
Arto, oh.

1868
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:15,620
That's fine probably.

1869
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:18,040
Oh, hi!

1870
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:19,100
Dang it.

1871
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:20,880
Don't think.

1872
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:24,990
Oh, I didn't have...

1873
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:28,490
attack this one though.

1874
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:34,850
Oh, this one's hard!

1875
02:07:36,510 --> 02:07:37,790
Minky the bomber.

1876
02:07:38,670 --> 02:07:40,830
If only I had better aim.

1877
02:07:46,730 --> 02:07:48,930
If only I had better aim.

1878
02:08:00,630 --> 02:08:01,710
Save scum?

1879
02:08:02,450 --> 02:08:04,250
Well, I could retry, that's true.

1880
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:21,140
Symmetry.

1881
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:22,380
Symmetry.

1882
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:34,700
I don't know what he just did, but...

1883
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:35,860
Was he throwing grenade at me?

1884
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:36,920
Oh, shit!

1885
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:40,040
How the- Oh, shoot!

1886
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:45,180
Uh-oh.

1887
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:46,260
Oh, shoot.

1888
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:47,700
Uh-oh.

1889
02:08:55,330 --> 02:08:56,270
That wasn't good.

1890
02:08:57,490 --> 02:09:00,730
I guess I could have, uh, used my...

1891
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:03,030
Hand on it, but whatever.

1892
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:06,030
Oops.

1893
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:07,650
It's fine.

1894
02:09:07,850 --> 02:09:08,170
We're fine.

1895
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:08,830
Everything's fine.

1896
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:13,850
Oh my god, she's alive!

1897
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:15,830
She returned!

1898
02:09:16,570 --> 02:09:16,870
Oh.

1899
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:29,520
Another haunted rag doll.

1900
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:30,920
It's so funny.

1901
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:32,380
I have a question.

1902
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:39,160
Um, if my health gets so low, little sisters in this level
too.

1903
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:41,180
That's so scary.

1904
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:47,300
I do like games that don't really hold your hand so much,
but also I want hand holding.

1905
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:48,000
Me too!

1906
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,440
Um, you can loot the robot.

1907
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,240
You're so right.

1908
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:53,560
Where did it die?

1909
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:54,260
I don't remember.

1910
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:55,540
Oh, it exploded over there.

1911
02:09:56,940 --> 02:10:00,500
Um, okay, so I have nine health packs, right?

1912
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:06,880
If I lose all my health, does it automatically use the next
health pack, or am I dead?

1913
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,500
That was my question.

1914
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:15,960
No, you're dead.

1915
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,600
Okay, good to know.

1916
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:36,200
I have, I've been, I've been drinking this like Yuzu honey
tea.

1917
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:41,980
But all the left, like the Yuzu peels, uh, yeah, let's say
real quick, you're right.

1918
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:45,340
All the Yuzu, um, settles at the bottom.

1919
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:48,660
And so I just like, got a mouthful of Yuzu.

1920
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:52,700
Oops, I missed.

1921
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,700
Is there a...

1922
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,000
Is there...

1923
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,920
I don't think I can hide...

1924
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:04,360
Ouch!

1925
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:04,780
Ouch!

1926
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:07,260
Hmm.

1927
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:11,680
Intense user flavor.

1928
02:11:11,860 --> 02:11:13,320
Yeah, but it's really good.

1929
02:11:17,610 --> 02:11:18,190
Okay.

1930
02:11:19,390 --> 02:11:21,350
Yeah, I think I just gotta, like, rush it.

1931
02:11:21,450 --> 02:11:22,010
I think I...

1932
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:22,110
Go.

1933
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:29,800
Uh-oh.

1934
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:30,820
It's pretty difficult.

1935
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:43,040
What is this?

1936
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:43,720
Oh, wait.

1937
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:44,300
What is that?

1938
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,040
Uh...

1939
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:46,820
Okay, nice, nice.

1940
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:48,280
Uh...

1941
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:48,880
It

1942
02:11:58,510 --> 02:12:01,730
speeds up the flow.

1943
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:11,450
It sounds the alarm if you finish pointing at it.

1944
02:12:11,650 --> 02:12:12,710
Oh, that's no good.

1945
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:21,330
Okay, actually, I took way less damage than I thought I
would.

1946
02:12:22,690 --> 02:12:24,410
So that's not All bad?

1947
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:26,470
Static.

1948
02:12:27,850 --> 02:12:28,410
Charge.

1949
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:32,550
You emit a burst of electricity when struck damaging all
around you!

1950
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:35,290
Okay.

1951
02:12:38,610 --> 02:12:39,170
Sure.

1952
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:42,970
It summons bots.

1953
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:43,630
Okay, okay.

1954
02:12:44,070 --> 02:12:44,230
Cool.

1955
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:44,750
Good to know.

1956
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:45,490
Thank you, guys.

1957
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:51,770
Guys are so helpful.

1958
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:52,830
It's so nice.

1959
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:53,370
Thank you.

1960
02:12:58,780 --> 02:12:59,580
No ice.

1961
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:03,440
Alright, sorry.

1962
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:04,480
I'm going to save again.

1963
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:05,900
Save.

1964
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:08,160
I'm just going to save over the last thing I did.

1965
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:12,040
Yippee!

1966
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:12,720
Okay.

1967
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:17,120
Got my...

1968
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,480
I'm just looking around real quick.

1969
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:24,220
It looks like it wants me to go in there, potentially.

1970
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:37,780
you see the guy like in the in the corner you see him but
before we do that

1971
02:13:45,430 --> 02:13:52,860
what the how did it see me I don't even see it

1972
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:02,700
what is yeah I want to hack it

1973
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:08,600
Maybe if I run...

1974
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:08,880
Hack!

1975
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:10,960
Oh, I got it!

1976
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:13,520
Oh my gosh.

1977
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:14,980
I'm shocked.

1978
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:18,860
Uh...

1979
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:20,520
Uh...

1980
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:22,100
Uh...

1981
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:22,680
Sure.

1982
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:24,460
Where's the...

1983
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:25,040
Oh, down there.

1984
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:25,260
Okay.

1985
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:26,480
Oh,

1986
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:33,360
we might be able to get this.

1987
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:38,280
Oh, sh...

1988
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,720
Uh, oh, uh...

1989
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:40,820
Okay, hold on.

1990
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:41,200
Hold on.

1991
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:47,000
Uh.

1992
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,260
Uh.

1993
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:49,300
Uh.

1994
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:49,360
Uh.

1995
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:51,060
And then this.

1996
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:54,020
Yeah, I think that's it.

1997
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:56,100
Yay!

1998
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:00,740
Oh, another safe.

1999
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:02,200
Look at that crab!

2000
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:11,680
Well, there's so good a lot of supplies and stuff.

2001
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:13,560
Kind of awesome.

2002
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:14,020
Okay.

2003
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:16,660
Ah!

2004
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:17,200
Okay.

2005
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:18,860
Wait, we're gonna save scum this.

2006
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:35,260
That's what you notice, of course I noticed the crab.

2007
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:37,560
Oh my god, it's one of these again.

2008
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:40,100
Okay, uh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2009
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,200
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2010
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:50,750
Oh no, no!

2011
02:15:51,690 --> 02:15:52,430
Uh, you.

2012
02:15:52,930 --> 02:15:54,070
And then, uh, you.

2013
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:55,250
And then, uh, you.

2014
02:15:55,570 --> 02:15:56,550
Okay, okay, okay.

2015
02:15:58,010 --> 02:16:00,210
Uh, and then, uh, you.

2016
02:16:00,910 --> 02:16:01,810
And then you.

2017
02:16:02,630 --> 02:16:03,330
Uh, you?

2018
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:05,210
Uh, you?

2019
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,050
You.

2020
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:07,270
First try.

2021
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:16,190
Medrito, somewhere beyond the sea.

2022
02:16:16,730 --> 02:16:18,010
What is your wisdom of the day?

2023
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:20,410
Saving or dooming the sisters?

2024
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:21,330
Is that what you said?

2025
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:23,850
I'm a little sister believer.

2026
02:16:25,770 --> 02:16:27,070
That was close, wasn't it?

2027
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:28,670
That was pretty dang close.

2028
02:16:32,630 --> 02:16:37,830
Okay There's two first aid kits in there

2029
02:16:42,230 --> 02:16:47,410
Try and remember that save the sisters save the sisters

2030
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:56,470
Somewhere Beyond the sea.

2031
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:57,210
Oh dang it.

2032
02:16:57,250 --> 02:17:02,230
I just realized the bandages Someone waiting for me

2033
02:17:08,290 --> 02:17:08,810
Aphrodite.

2034
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:10,510
I have what you're looking for.

2035
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:12,550
Just open your eyes.

2036
02:17:13,010 --> 02:17:18,760
And she cuts me into a thousand beautiful pieces.

2037
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:23,140
I already think we're gonna have to fight this thing, aren't
we?

2038
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:26,480
Whatever the heck it is.

2039
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:28,600
Lobster!

2040
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:30,280

2041
02:17:31,460 --> 02:17:32,440
That's not so good.

2042
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:33,540
For that guy.

2043
02:17:35,660 --> 02:17:36,460
Oh, geez.

02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,340

2053
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,060
Did he learn a new dance?

2054
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:12,900
Oh, he hit the gritty?

2055
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:14,480
He did a flip!

2056
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:17,220
Oh, my God.

2057
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:23,820
I was watching being smug.

2058
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:24,940
What smug?

2059
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:28,400
What's that?

2060
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:35,920
I wonder if we'll want this.

2061
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:37,740
Wait, Adam.

2062
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:44,720
Denies us any excuse for not being beautiful.

2063
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:49,200
And then, um...

2064
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:51,700
Maybe our shoddy.

2065
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:04,150
I know I just saved, but...

2066
02:23:04,150 --> 02:23:05,150
Because I'm here.

2067
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:06,990
All right.

2068
02:23:09,110 --> 02:23:09,810
All right.

2069
02:23:11,050 --> 02:23:13,390
Well, let's see how the fight goes first.

2070
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:14,750
Oh.

2071
02:23:15,350 --> 02:23:16,890
There's so many storage things.

2072
02:23:17,050 --> 02:23:18,230
Search containers for loot.

2073
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:19,670
I tried.

2074
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:20,850
There's nothing.

2075
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:22,290
Thanks for telling me.

2076
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:23,550
Thanks for helping out.

2077
02:23:23,710 --> 02:23:24,850
I really appreciate it.

2078
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:26,210
Gosh.

2079
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:28,830
Search for loot.

2080
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:30,450
That doesn't exist.

2081
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:32,230
Okay.

2082
02:23:33,550 --> 02:23:34,570
Front seating.

2083
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:38,390
Try freeze on hackable stuff to slow it down.

2084
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:42,650
Wait, I'm- wait.

2085
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:47,630
Thank you for helping.

2086
02:23:48,830 --> 02:23:50,730
Unity child, welcome to membership!

2087
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:51,510
Thank you!

2088
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,950
Yeah, by the way, search containers for loot.

2089
02:23:55,190 --> 02:23:57,270
By the way, they probably won't have any.

2090
02:23:59,730 --> 02:24:00,770
Alright, I'm ready.

2091
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:02,850
What can I do with this one, Aphrodite?

2092
02:24:06,250 --> 02:24:10,810
I want to make them beautiful, but they always turn out
wrong.

2093
02:24:11,570 --> 02:24:13,390
That was too fat.

2094
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:15,830
This one too tall.

2095
02:24:16,810 --> 02:24:18,530
This one too symmetrical.

2096
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:20,390
I thought you...

2097
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:21,850
What's this, goddess?

2098
02:24:23,150 --> 02:24:23,910
An intruder.

2099
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:25,310
He is ugly.

2100
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:26,910
Ugly.

2101
02:24:27,490 --> 02:24:27,970
Ugly.

2102
02:24:28,570 --> 02:24:29,130
Ugly.

2103
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:31,170
Hey, that's not very nice.

2104
02:24:31,650 --> 02:24:32,590
Look at you.

2105
02:24:32,710 --> 02:24:33,470
It is.

2106
02:24:36,410 --> 02:24:37,970
Oh, oh, with your Gs.

2107
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:38,510
Oh, geez.

2108
02:24:38,590 --> 02:24:38,750
Okay.

2109
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:47,940
Oh, shoot.

2110
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:48,560
Oh, shoot.

2111
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:55,960
You know who I am?

2112
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:57,400
I wish I didn't.

2113
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:57,840
Oh!

2114
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:05,100
Oh, my God.

2115
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:05,980
Oh, my God.

2116
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:07,200
Ah, geez!

2117
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:10,860
I think I'm just gonna keep shooting you.

2118
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:12,560
Ah!

2119
02:25:25,410 --> 02:25:26,250
Oh, my God.

2120
02:25:26,410 --> 02:25:26,990
Oh, my God.

2121
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:33,510
It just won't stop.

2122
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:35,930
It just won't stop!

2123
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:40,110
Oh my god, this guy can eat the million bullets!

2124
02:25:41,310 --> 02:25:42,190
Where is he?

2125
02:25:44,590 --> 02:25:46,230
Oh my god!

2126
02:25:47,090 --> 02:25:47,970
Holy cow!

2127
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:56,700
Get the key from Steinman.

2156
02:29:15,690 --> 02:29:20,490
It seems like these are why I put ammo in random drawers of
my house and in random drawers of other houses and places

2157

02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:16,250
I saw it.

2171
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:26,060
Isn't this all this jazz getting you guys in the mood for a
jazz club, huh?

2172
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:28,940
Yeah, just a little fire.

02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:29,780
It's fine.

2174
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:32,180
The

2175
02:30:41,320 --> 02:30:45,800
savings will happily work out an affordable payment plan for
any major procedure.

2176
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:47,580
Wait, did I hack this?

2177
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:49,080
No.

2178
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:52,220

Okay, let's try.

2184

Oh, okay, good, good, good.

2189
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:19,090
Wait, what just happened?

2190
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:23,820
No!

2191
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:29,200
Uh, no, no, no.

2192
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:31,060
Uh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, there we go.

2193
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:40,460
Yeah, did you guys know that two days, Friday?

2194
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:48,240
This Friday, February 13th of 2026, depending on when you're
watching this VOD, huh?

2195
02:31:49,140 --> 02:32:01,720
But as of the live stream in in in two days I will have a
live 3d jazz show that I'm extremely nervous for and tickets

2196
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:04,980
are sold out for in person but there are streaming tickets
available!

2197
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:09,780
I know, Friday the 13th.

2198
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:10,800
So spooky, right?

2199
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:15,320
Welcome to the Circus of Values!

2200
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:19,620
We'll do that.

2201
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:29,380
What was it that I switched this up?

2202
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:29,870
Hold on.

2203
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:34,220
Ah, I like that.

2204
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:50,880
But we probably want to skip um changing those just yet
because yeah all right sorry save because i just uh there we

2205
02:32:50,880 --> 02:33:02,480
go okay i really wish vending machines were real would be so
convenient right so handy hello restore vigor and spirit

2206
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:03,890
with the touch of a button

2207
02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:14,970
welcome to rapture the world's fastest growing partner

2208
02:33:21,050 --> 02:33:21,930
What the...

2209
02:33:21,930 --> 02:33:22,230
What the?

2210
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:23,290
These fish.

2211
02:33:23,970 --> 02:33:28,430
All right.

2212
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:38,300
Oh, this is open now.

2213
02:33:40,820 --> 02:33:42,180
Oh, it does not sound good in there.

2214
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,640
Wait, is that Big Daddy?

2215
02:34:16,270 --> 02:34:17,390
There's something there.

2216
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:18,610
Is that little sister?

2217
02:34:18,870 --> 02:34:19,170
Oh, no.

2218
02:34:19,290 --> 02:34:19,790
It's a little one.

2219
02:34:20,530 --> 02:34:21,970
Here's your chance to get some Adam.

2220
02:34:24,890 --> 02:34:25,110
How?

2221
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:30,400
How?

2222
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:39,000
Mr. Bubba's...

2223
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,100
Oh.

2224
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:47,400
It's

2225
02:34:51,650 --> 02:34:53,050
you who will be shot next.

2226
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:54,070
Easy now, doctor.

2227
02:34:54,210 --> 02:34:55,670
He's just looking for a wee bit of Adam.

2228
02:34:55,970 --> 02:34:56,870
Just enough to get by.

2229
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:59,390
I'll not have him hurt my little ones.

2230
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:00,530
It's okay, lad.

2231
02:35:00,830 --> 02:35:01,650
That's not a child.

2232
02:35:01,790 --> 02:35:02,770
Not anymore, it ain't.

2233
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:05,090
Dr. Tennis Mounds sought to that.

2234
02:35:05,210 --> 02:35:06,590
Bitter, do not hurt her.

2235
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:08,070
Have you not hurt?

2236
02:35:08,470 --> 02:35:12,970
Aye, that's a pretty sermon coming from the goon who cooked
up them creatures in the first place.

2237
02:35:13,690 --> 02:35:16,710
Took fine little girls and turned them into that, didn't
you?

2238
02:35:20,310 --> 02:35:20,970
Boyo.

2239
02:35:21,890 --> 02:35:22,550
Boyo.

2240
02:35:22,590 --> 02:35:24,470
Are you prepared to drain your life?

2241
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:29,630
Oh, she's scared though!

2242
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:31,630
There is another way.

2243
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:33,410
Use this.

2244
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:35,790
Free from their torment.

2245
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:38,930
I will make it to be worth your while.

2246
02:35:39,670 --> 02:35:39,990
Somehow.

2247
02:35:42,210 --> 02:35:43,510
Wait, how do I use that?

2248
02:35:46,890 --> 02:35:48,150
Wait, how do I use that?

2249
02:35:49,790 --> 02:35:51,770
How do I use it though?

2250
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:59,600
Oh baby!

2251
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:05,300
Choose whether to rescue the little sister or harvest her!

2252
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:15,380
If you harvest her you get maximum atom to spend on plasmids
But she will not survive the process if you rescue her you

2253
02:36:15,380 --> 02:36:20,640
get less atom but tendon bomb has promised to make it worth
your while.

2254
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:23,000
Oh my god.

2255
02:36:23,420 --> 02:36:23,960
Harvester!

2256
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:30,020
Roadrunner cartoons.

2257
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:31,940
Roadrunner cartoons.

2258
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:34,040
I want to save the little sister.

2259
02:36:34,660 --> 02:36:34,900
Rescue.

2260
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:37,900
I like how it's like, L.

2261
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:38,440
Rescue.

2262
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:39,860
No!

2263
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:41,800
No!

2264
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:42,360
No!

2265
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:52,600
Thank you.

2266
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:23,360
looks don't make it so you need all the item you can get to
survive you need a boost you got this there you go spend

2267
02:37:32,790 --> 02:37:37,410
atom for new powers yeah oh

2268
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:43,620
the garden oh

2269
02:37:53,820 --> 02:38:04,840
golden film reels you've unlocked an episode of the
director's commentary oh spoiler warning the commentary

2270
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:07,620
contains in-depth discussion of plot data okay thank you

2271
02:38:19,170 --> 02:38:34,470
that's cool you can actually spare the little sisters flesh
with stem versions of the dead cells but their relationship

2272
02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:42,750
with the implanted slugs is symbiotic I imagine that eating
them will turn you into one of these crazy guys you know so

2273
02:38:42,750 --> 02:38:43,750
you see it's not like

2274
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:49,070
End.

2275
02:38:53,410 --> 02:38:53,770
End.

2276
02:38:53,770 --> 02:38:56,190
I imagine that maybe there are multiple endings.

2277
02:38:57,090 --> 02:39:00,650
And if you spare the little sisters...

2278
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:01,730
I bet I...

2279
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:05,310
What's that say?

2280
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:06,610
Oh, splicer!

2281
02:39:07,210 --> 02:39:07,770
I said, ah.

2282
02:39:08,770 --> 02:39:09,910
I was like, hold.

2283
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:13,030
Um...

2284
02:39:15,050 --> 02:39:15,530
But...

2285
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:21,590
I imagine the game would be kind of kind and allow you one
little sister to eat, right?

2286
02:39:22,370 --> 02:39:23,210
I don't know.

2287
02:39:26,530 --> 02:39:26,810
Whoa!

2288
02:39:28,270 --> 02:39:29,370
Oh, increased maximum health.

2289
02:39:29,790 --> 02:39:30,290
Eve upgrade.

2290
02:39:30,770 --> 02:39:32,050
Wait, that's kind of huge though.

2291
02:39:32,530 --> 02:39:34,490
First aid kids also give you Eve!

2292
02:39:34,770 --> 02:39:35,670
Wait, that's huge!

2293
02:39:38,730 --> 02:39:42,150
Enrage's target causing it to attack someone other than you.

2294
02:39:50,590 --> 02:39:52,650
Is this the one that I need to...

2295
02:39:52,650 --> 02:39:52,790
Wait.

2296
02:39:56,570 --> 02:39:57,790
We could get the first three.

2297
02:39:59,950 --> 02:40:02,870
I think first aid kits giving you Eve is also, like, huge.

2298
02:40:03,130 --> 02:40:04,710
Because there's so little Eve around.

2299
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:10,990
You have picked up your first physical tonic.

2300
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:28,120
And then...

2301
02:40:30,510 --> 02:40:31,930
We can only pick one.

2302
02:40:36,430 --> 02:40:36,870
Okay.

2303
02:40:37,550 --> 02:40:37,950
Enrage?

2304
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:40,230
Causes the target to attack someone.

2305
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:42,830
So if there's multiple enemies, they would...

2306
02:40:42,830 --> 02:40:43,890
How does it work, though?

2307
02:40:43,990 --> 02:40:45,050
Is it, like, automatic?

2308
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:52,740
Part of me wants to get enrage because armored shell is
pretty cheap.

2309
02:40:56,660 --> 02:40:57,780
Could be more options later.

2310
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:58,520
I guess that's true.

2311
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:01,420
Oh, it's an active cast.

2312
02:41:01,540 --> 02:41:04,000
Oh, I don't think I would... I don't think I would remember.

2313
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:07,580
I think I would be like... I think I would forget about it.

2314
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:08,380
I'll be honest.

2315
02:41:10,300 --> 02:41:11,120
you cast.

2316
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:16,060
Yeah, maybe we'll save up then.

2317
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:28,460
If anything, we can always come back to this and get, uh...

2318
02:41:30,420 --> 02:41:32,460
And get the, uh...

2319
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,280
Wait, please take the pistol round.

2320
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:41,640
Please take the round.

2321
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:43,920
Oh, I can't carry anymore.

2322
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:44,480
Okay.

2323
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:46,440
Okay.

2324
02:41:55,660 --> 02:41:57,420
Am I going the right way?

2325
02:41:58,260 --> 02:41:59,320
Actually, now I think about it.

2326
02:41:59,500 --> 02:41:59,740
Hold on.

2327
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:04,780
Because we came from here.

2328
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:09,260
Oh, no, yeah.

2329
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:09,640
Okay.

2330
02:42:10,660 --> 02:42:12,200
Oh, this is what happened.

2331
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:13,020
It got all...

2332
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:13,200
Okay.

2333
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:15,000
Got it.

2334
02:42:19,220 --> 02:42:19,980
Got it.

2335
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:33,960
Oh, we're back here!

2336
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:35,460
Oh, we went in a big old circle!

2337
02:42:36,020 --> 02:42:36,920
I see now.

2338
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:40,980
Um...

2339
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:42,480
Oh, okay, I thought that was someone walking.

2340
02:42:42,860 --> 02:42:45,460
We have to go to the, uh...

2341
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:46,140
What did we give?

2342
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:46,680
We got the...

2343
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:47,240
Okay, hold on.

2344
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:50,500
Oh, we just go all the way back to the beginning.

2345
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,060
What about the denture?

2346
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:54,300
The dental place.

2347
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:56,060
Dandy dental.

2348
02:42:58,520 --> 02:43:00,200
We never got the key for that.

2349
02:43:02,140 --> 02:43:02,540
Okay.

2350
02:43:02,620 --> 02:43:05,800
And the Ryan asks you a simple question.

2351
02:43:08,400 --> 02:43:09,640
You're ready now.

2352
02:43:09,880 --> 02:43:12,160
It's time to take out one of them big daddy's.

2353
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:16,340
It won't be easy, but it's the only way to get the little
sisters and the Adam they carry.

2354
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:17,540
Oh.

2355
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:20,740
There is another little sister ahead.

2356
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:23,900
To get the Adam from her, you must deal with her big daddy
first.

2357
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:28,180
I feel ridiculous saying these sentences.

2358
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:33,520
Good luck!

2359
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:36,860
Well, good thing I just saved.

2360
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:42,020
I'm scared!

2361
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:44,200
Look, look, look!

2362
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,220
Can I zap them?

2363
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:51,260
Mr.

2364
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:56,190
B.

2365
02:43:56,950 --> 02:43:57,270
Mr. B.

2366
02:43:59,790 --> 02:44:00,890
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

2367
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:09,190
It's an actual real boss fight, so I'm holding nothing back.

2368
02:44:09,370 --> 02:44:10,350
Scared me on my knee.

2369
02:44:10,690 --> 02:44:11,610
Scared me on my knee!

2370
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:16,260
I'm scared!

2371
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:18,400
These guys are huge!

2372
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:21,840
Oh yeah!

2373
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:55,440
Bioshock failed to properly shut down the last time it was
run.

2374
02:44:56,360 --> 02:44:59,740
Would you like to revert the in-game options to default
settings?

2375
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:01,680
They already are default settings.

2376
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:02,900
I'll just say no.

2377
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:14,160
Big Daddy too strong broke the game!

2378
02:45:15,460 --> 02:45:16,600
have fun with Bioshock!

2379
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:20,900
I finished my challenge with a Bioshock 2 with melee and
plasmids only, holy cow.

2380
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:29,540
Okay.

2381
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:32,180
Your computer is scared of the boss fight too.

2382
02:45:32,680 --> 02:45:33,280
Apparently yeah.

2383
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:35,660
Understandably so.

2384
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:39,120
Understandably so.

2385
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:40,140
Load game.

2386
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:42,480
Okay.

2387
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,520
We'll just have to do this a little bit again.

2388
02:45:46,840 --> 02:45:56,260
I read a lot of reviews on both the original and the
remaster that people said this just happened.

2389
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:58,920
Big daddy, don't fight Fayer.

2390
02:46:12,350 --> 02:46:15,690
I'm gonna save right here though, just to...

2391
02:46:15,690 --> 02:46:19,150
So we have, I don't know, to have my setup and everything
already.

2392
02:46:21,970 --> 02:46:23,450
Wait, what are we fighting at?

2393
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:25,610
What are we shooting at?

2394
02:46:32,370 --> 02:46:39,570
It's just a guy there where did you come from so

2395
02:46:46,410 --> 02:47:00,140

02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:11,800

2397
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:16,220

02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:27,300

2399
02:47:30,540 --> 02:47:32,000

2400
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:40,080

2401
02:47:54,380 --> 02:47:55,940
there she is

2402
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:01,980
Will they see me if I'm like over here?

2403
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:03,580
You know?

2404
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:05,060
Oh.

2405
02:48:22,020 --> 02:48:23,580
The way I waddle?

2406
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:32,780
What is this one?

2407
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:34,560
Oh, just kidding.

2408
02:48:34,740 --> 02:48:36,360
I thought there was one red at the bottom.

2409
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:42,250
I could hear of, oh my god.

2410
02:48:42,730 --> 02:48:43,390
Wait, where'd that guy go?

2411
02:48:49,350 --> 02:48:49,670
Okay.

2412
02:48:50,110 --> 02:48:52,170
I don't remember where I'm supposed to go, I'll be honest.

2413
02:48:58,390 --> 02:49:00,190
Where the hell?

2414
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:08,190
Anyway.

2415
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:27,720
Okay,

2416
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:31,740
okay.

2417
02:49:32,660 --> 02:49:32,940
Anyway.

2418
02:49:35,560 --> 02:49:37,780
It's better to fight the daddy for the atom.

2419
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:40,780
I agree, but...

2420
02:49:40,900 --> 02:49:43,000
I mean...

2421
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,680
I could go back and try.

2422
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:48,900
This save has us past him, so...

2423
02:49:59,390 --> 02:50:00,990
Was it in here?

2424
02:50:03,950 --> 02:50:05,110
Is he still in here?

2425
02:50:09,210 --> 02:50:10,730
Wait, they left.

2426
02:50:12,330 --> 02:50:13,810
Oh no, I hear him.

2427
02:50:14,090 --> 02:50:14,850
Oh, I heard him.

2428
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:17,990
Oh.

2429
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:23,800
I heard him for a second.

2430
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:30,080
I'm safe.

2431
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:30,880
It's going so hard.

2432
02:50:31,060 --> 02:50:31,360
I'm sorry.

2433
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:38,460
You can skip the fight, but then you can't save the sister.

2434
02:50:38,820 --> 02:50:40,200
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

2435
02:50:52,390 --> 02:50:53,250
Where'd he go?

2436
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:55,210
Where did he go?

2437
02:50:59,970 --> 02:51:01,130
They're so fast?

2438
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:02,630
He wasn't gone for that long!

2439
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:05,910
Oh, I heard him.

2440
02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:14,770
Oh!

2441
02:51:16,030 --> 02:51:21,870
Also, I just realized if I had my fire, I would be able to
burn this and go in there.

2442
02:51:22,290 --> 02:51:22,550
Okay.

2443
02:51:23,350 --> 02:51:25,010
I'll have to remember that for the future.

2444
02:51:26,410 --> 02:51:27,090
The funeral.

2445
02:51:28,410 --> 02:51:29,550
It's too scary.

2446
02:51:32,830 --> 02:51:34,150
Oh, hell yeah!

2447
02:51:40,470 --> 02:51:41,670
You can actually come back.

2448
02:51:41,730 --> 02:51:42,450
Oh, there she is.

2449
02:51:45,950 --> 02:51:47,670
I wish I could get them back over here.

2450
02:51:48,190 --> 02:51:49,470
You know, like...

2451
02:51:50,290 --> 02:51:52,050
Will they aggro on me if they see me?

2452
02:51:52,250 --> 02:51:57,690
But I wish I could get them back here so that he can get
distracted by my turret again, you know?

2453
02:51:58,330 --> 02:51:59,850
That was a pretty good setup, I feel.

2454
02:52:00,630 --> 02:52:01,510
Oh, no, they won't.

2455
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:03,130
They're friendly unless you get too close.

2456
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:03,830
Oh, okay, okay.

2457
02:52:06,610 --> 02:52:08,270
You get close to them or attack them.

2458
02:52:08,350 --> 02:52:08,810
Okay, okay.

2459
02:52:19,810 --> 02:52:23,490
Wow, it's so cool watching him walk around.

2460
02:52:41,170 --> 02:52:44,010
Oh my gosh, I missed so much.

2461
02:52:48,290 --> 02:52:49,790
Wait, did I miss him?

2462
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:51,090
I thought I saw text.

2463
02:52:52,810 --> 02:52:52,970
Oh.

2464
02:52:57,790 --> 02:53:00,830
She's just chilling with him.

2465
02:53:10,770 --> 02:53:12,530
Anything but fight.

2466
02:53:12,730 --> 02:53:14,090
I know, I'm scared, okay, guys?

2467
02:53:15,550 --> 02:53:17,610
Alright, last, last, last save.

2468
02:53:17,870 --> 02:53:18,210
Last save.

2469
02:53:18,630 --> 02:53:18,990
Oh my gosh.

2470
02:53:19,310 --> 02:53:19,790
Game, please.

2471
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:24,830
Now my mouse is, like, messing up and clicking outside of
the...

2472
02:53:24,830 --> 02:53:25,710
Okay, here we go.

2473
02:53:38,910 --> 02:53:39,730
Holy shit!

2474
02:53:49,460 --> 02:53:50,520
Oh, geez!

2475
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:51,560
Oh!

2476
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:05,020
I took him down!

2477
02:54:11,130 --> 02:54:12,530
I got him!

2478
02:54:13,510 --> 02:54:14,590
75 bucks!

2479
02:54:15,550 --> 02:54:17,390
All right, come here, little baby.

2480
02:54:18,410 --> 02:54:21,710
No, no, no, no.

2481
02:54:23,630 --> 02:54:23,770
Holy.

2482
02:54:28,230 --> 02:54:33,950
I still feel like, I mean, I know probably things are gonna
get real expensive later, you know.

2483
02:54:36,390 --> 02:54:38,990
But at the same time, oh, creepy.

2484
02:54:39,930 --> 02:54:43,790
At the same time, I feel like we still...

2485
02:54:46,530 --> 02:54:47,930
We get enough.

2486
02:54:49,490 --> 02:54:50,630
Where'd she go to?

2487
02:54:53,430 --> 02:54:54,490
Another way.

2488
02:54:54,770 --> 02:54:56,430
Dream time, Mr. Bubbles.

2489
02:54:57,550 --> 02:54:58,430
Oh, there she goes.

2490
02:54:59,990 --> 02:55:01,610
Into her little hole.

2491
02:55:02,330 --> 02:55:03,310
Into the hidey hole.

2492
02:55:05,030 --> 02:55:05,850
Holy cow!

2493
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:06,830
We did it!

2494
02:55:06,930 --> 02:55:07,150
Woo!

2495
02:55:10,290 --> 02:55:12,110
I'm out of armor, people.

2496
02:55:17,360 --> 02:55:18,800
Where are these people coming from?

2497
02:55:28,450 --> 02:55:33,330
Oh, remember how I just said my game, my mouse is like
clicking out of my game?

2498
02:55:33,610 --> 02:55:34,930
That's literally what just happened.

2499
02:55:36,730 --> 02:55:38,090
Here's another big daddy!

2500
02:55:40,230 --> 02:55:41,050
Guys, there's two.

2501
02:55:43,990 --> 02:55:44,870
There's two of them.

2502
02:55:48,830 --> 02:55:49,910
Hey, don't hit me.

2503
02:55:55,330 --> 02:55:56,790
Why is there a second one?

2504
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:00,830
Why is there a second one so suddenly?

2505
02:56:01,950 --> 02:56:03,890
It did say in the thing that...

2506
02:56:03,890 --> 02:56:05,970
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2507
02:56:06,090 --> 02:56:06,310
Oh my god, wait.

2508
02:56:10,050 --> 02:56:11,710
There's not always a little sister.

2509
02:56:12,130 --> 02:56:12,330
Oh, okay.

2510
02:56:13,110 --> 02:56:14,550
Got it, got it, got it.

2511
02:56:16,710 --> 02:56:17,110
Interesting.

2512
02:56:20,910 --> 02:56:21,770
Oh, oops.

2513
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:32,320
I don't feel so great either.

2514
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:33,440
I'm scared.

2515
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:36,760
Wait, I'm fine.

2516
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:38,000
Oh my gosh.

2517
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:40,580
My mouse is really screwing up.

2518
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:41,620
Holy cow.

2519
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:44,140
I was...

2520
02:56:44,140 --> 02:56:44,420
Okay.

2521
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:48,220
I was thinking of calling it here.

2522
02:56:48,780 --> 02:56:49,260
Anyway?

2523
02:56:50,020 --> 02:56:50,500
I think...

2524
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:51,440
Let me actually...

2525
02:56:51,440 --> 02:56:51,860
Okay, hold on.

2526
02:56:51,940 --> 02:56:52,380
I'll say...

2527
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:54,100
Let's do this.

2528
02:56:56,680 --> 02:56:59,360
Let's do the emergency thing, and then I think I'll call it
there.

2529
02:57:02,540 --> 02:57:03,180
Yeah,

2530
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:07,220
that's good.

2531
02:57:07,400 --> 02:57:07,740
That's good.

2532
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:09,680
Uh-huh.

2533
02:57:11,480 --> 02:57:17,480
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

2534
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:18,900
Upwards.

2535
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:21,780
And overwards.

2536
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:24,300
And this way.

2537
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:29,480
I am enjoying it.

2538
02:57:29,540 --> 02:57:30,500
I'm having a lot of fun.

2539
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:31,300
I'm having a lot of fun.

2540
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:33,500
Circus of value.

2541
02:57:33,940 --> 02:57:36,060
Circus of value.

2542
02:57:37,220 --> 02:57:38,100
Electric buck.

2543
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:44,700
Electric buckshot is particularly effective against targets
vulnerable to electricity.

2544
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:47,860
Whoa.

2545
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:52,360
Okay.

2546
02:58:06,460 --> 02:58:07,100
All right.

2547
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:10,960
