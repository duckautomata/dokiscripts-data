00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,450
Hello, everybody.

2
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,070
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

3
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,870
Welcome, welcome, welcome in.

4
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,270
Welcome, welcome, welcome in.

5
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,670
And welcome back to Double Make Cry.

6
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,790
Make Cry.

7
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,090
Make Cry.

8
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,150
Woo-hoo!

9
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,070
Thank you guys for the super jobs.

10
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,930
Welcome to membership.

11
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,810
Thank you.

12
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,290
Thank you.

13
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,490
Thank you.

14
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,830
Thank you.

15
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,050
Thank you.

16
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,750
One second.

17
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,350
I think my setup is weird.

18
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:57,850
Hold on.

19
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,470
That was better.

20
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,410
I think I'm stupid.

21
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:16,130
I think last week, last time I played this, I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to endurance the rest of this.

22
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,470
This game.

23
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,270
And then I'm like, looking out, I'm like, I'm only on mission 8 out of 20.

24
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,050
I have high lofty goals.

25
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,420
I have big goals.

26
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,340
And big, it's a big eyes, small stomach.

27
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,460
But, I do want to finish it tomorrow.

28
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,220
So, we'll do double, double, double, double, double, make cry.

29
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,580
So, I was just, um, also, I was also like, oh, I could probably endurance this game for a long time.

30
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,240
But, as you can see, I'm wearing glasses today.

31
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,080
And that's because, because of that, I slept in my spirit lenses, aka contacts.

32
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,340
And my glasses, especially when I wear headphones, they hurt my head.

33
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,500
They usually hurt my head anyway, because my head is too big and my glasses are too small.

34
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,900
I have sensitive, I have like a baby cranium.

35
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
Very soft.

36
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,480
And so, I slept in my contacts, and now I have to wear my glasses all day.

37
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,660
And, and they hurt with my headphones, so.

38
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,080
Hmm, yes.

39
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,860
Did you get your gorb?

40
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh my god!

41
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Oh my gosh, thank you for asking.

42
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,780
Because I was like, oh, I'm gonna do daily logins, so that I can get gorbs every day.

43
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,720
Did I do that?

44
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,260
No.

45
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
Did I remember yesterday?

46
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes, I did.

47
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:04,860
And then, I opened up today, and I think, I don't know what time it's on to get the dailies.

48
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,520
You know, but, speaking of dailies, while I'm talking, I'm gonna do my Blue Archive ones.

49
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:20,900
Um, but, uh, but it didn't give me one for today, so.

50
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,120
They make headphones for glasses wearers.

51
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah, but I don't, I don't like wearing my glasses, because they hurt my head, regardless of if I have headphones or not.

52
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,340
So, I'm not gonna buy headphones just for that.

53
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,600
Bad thing about having such a huge brain and anime eyes.

54
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,420
I know, my brain is way too big.

55
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm so wise.

56
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,680
New glasses?

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,380
Yeah, I thought about it.

58
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,200
Did you get your glasses resized to be more comfy?

59
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,080
No.

60
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
I could have.

61
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,980
Minto-sensei!

62
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
Ohayou gozaimasu!

63
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
That's what she says.

64
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,060
Wait.

65
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
Oh, she says oka iri nasai.

66
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,360
Sorry, I couldn't catch her say the Minto-sensei.

67
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,140
Soft-serve Minto-cranium.

68
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,340
No, I thought about going to the eye doctor, which I probably need to do again, though.

69
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,800
Hi, doc!

70
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,720
To, um, what's the word?

71
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,960
Uh, get them, get the new prescription, maybe.

72
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,720
I don't think I know.

73
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,860
Just the eye exam, right?

74
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,640
Amy, that was my birthday!

75
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,840
Would you believe I've never once had a VTuber sing happy birthday to me?

76
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,280
Since you aren't singing now, would you instead accept one sincere compliment?

77
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,360
Without fighting back too much.

78
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,880
Also, that was my controller disconnecting.

79
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,660
Don't worry about it.

80
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
A compliment?

81
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,340
Also Murphy, happy birthday!

82
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,040
I could sing.

83
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,120
I'd rather sing.

84
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,520
I'd rather sing, I'm not gonna lie.

85
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,080
Happy birthday to you.

86
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,300
Happy birthday to you.

87
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
Happy birthday dear Murphy.

88
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,140
Happy birthday to you.

89
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm okay.

90
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
Don't melt your eyes.

91
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not.

92
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,620
Also, my voice is a little worse than usual today.

93
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,700
So, we'll just, I'll just play until I feel like it.

94
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,580
I think I'll be okay.

95
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
I think it'll be fine.

96
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
I think it's because I had some milk earlier.

97
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,360
And my voice is a little...

98
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,320
icky.

99
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
Icky grossness.

100
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,900
But also, I'm eating cough drop right now, so...

101
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,220
It's my birthday today, Minto.

102
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,960
Could you do a spoken word jazz birthday song?

103
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm not doing compliments.

104
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,000
McMac, happy birthday!

105
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,280
It's also, I'm not giving compliments, you guys.

106
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,320
It says, Murphy said, would you accept a compliment?

107
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,680
I don't want to do that.

108
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
I don't want to, I don't want to accept anything.

109
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,300
All I do is accept my fate.

110
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,100
What's a jazz karaoke, or not karaoke, jazz birthday song?

111
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,200
I don't even, what does that mean?

112
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,980
What does that mean?

113
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,600
How do I jazz birthday song?

114
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
That just sounds like a spoken word jazz.

115
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,080
It's like a beat poem.

116
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,780
Uh, uh, oh!

117
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,660
Uh, no, I don't get it.

118
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,020
Wait, huh?

119
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,510
Miss Fizz, shut up.

120
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,140
What is spoken jazz?

121
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,180
You've done spoken jazz already.

122
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,740
I have?

123
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,420
What is it?

124
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,860
What is it?

125
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,180
I don't know.

126
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,240
How do you spoken jazz?

127
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,580
Jazz with speaking voice.

128
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,700
Skibbidi, skibbidi, bap badeb.

129
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,360
Skibb...

130
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Uh, beep beep, ba ba ba.

131
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,940
Skip, skibbidi, ba booba.

132
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,940
Happy birthday.

133
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,140
Big Mac.

134
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,980
Happy birthday to everybody.

135
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,420
Happy birthday... I think I did it right.

136
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,980
I think that's a happy... that's a birthday... that's a birthday song, probably.

137
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Of... of the... of the... of the... spoken jazz variety.

138
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,680
Perfect!

139
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh, yeah, baby!

140
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,260
And...

141
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh my gosh!

142
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,520
Oh, they're already hurting my head!

143
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,140
Ooh!

144
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,600
Hold on.

145
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm taking out my glasses.

146
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,200
Hold on.

147
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:06,640
Maybe I can try and find my... um... my earbuds instead.

148
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,800
Oh... One second!

149
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,660
One second!

150
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,740
I'll check this drawer!

151
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,200
Negative.

152
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,380
I'll check this drawer!

153
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,520
Negative.

154
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,080
I'll check this drawer!

155
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,180
I think they're in my backpack.

156
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
Where's my backpack?

157
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,860
Ah... Oh... I have air... I have earbuds instead of... instead.

158
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,660
Oh.

159
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,940
sobre... headphones.

160
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,260
Hmm... Go in the Wendy's?

161
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,140
I... I want a... I want... I want... I want a... a... uh... baked potato.

162
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:10,920
And I want... um... I want... I want... I want... uh... with sour cream.

163
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,100
And I want... uh... four-piece chicken nuggets... sweet and sour... nuggets.

164
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,180
Please!

165
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,300
As someone with glasses and headphones, I can relate.

166
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah.

167
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,700
Hold on.

168
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,900
Let me go find my backpack.

169
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,000
I think I know where it is.

170
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,040
Oh my god.

171
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:29,720
Murphy.

172
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,160
No!

173
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,000
Will you let yourself be proud of it sometime?

174
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm escaping.

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm escaping to go find my backpack.

176
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:52,610
So what I have... is a big bag that's filled with other bags.

177
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,990
Because I have so many bags.

178
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,770
I think... is it in this backpack?

179
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,970
Oh wait.

180
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,530
That's candy.

181
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,470
No.

182
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,930
It's not in that one.

183
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,570
Hold on.

184
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,370
My backpack isn't in here!

185
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:12,930
Uh oh.

186
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,430
I just made a mess for no reason.

187
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,170
I gotta put my bag... bags back.

188
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,690
My bags back in my bag.

189
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,210
For those who don't know what's going on, I'm looking for my ear... my ear buds.

190
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,450
Can you guys hear my bag?

191
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,350
And then my purse.

192
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,470
And I'll just zip that up later.

193
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,510
Hold on.

194
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,770
I think I know where it is.

195
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,090
Okay.

196
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,310
Oh no!

197
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:05,710
It's stuck!

198
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,630
Why is it stuck?

199
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,370
Okay.

200
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,170
I found my backpack.

201
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,510
Now I dig through here.

202
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,330
That's a deodorant.

203
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,650
That's lotion.

204
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,510
That's more lotion.

205
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,710
Oh!

206
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,870
There's my watch.

207
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,730
That's a...

208
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,770
That's not the wrong headphones.

209
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,340
Nah.

210
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,360
My watch has been found.

211
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,840
That's candy.

212
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh no!

213
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
Is it not in here either?

214
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,940
No way.

215
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,180
Wait.

216
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,900
Maybe it's in this little pouch that I keep inside my bag.

217
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,340
It is!

218
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,740
I found my ear buds.

219
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,920
Did

220
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,250
you hear that?

221
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,150
It was... it was velcro ASMR.

222
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:26,890
Okay.

223
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,970
Now I won't be dying.

224
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,730
Even though I'm already dead.

225
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,790
Ear buds discovered.

226
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:35,810
Ear buds discovered.

227
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,050
Okay.

228
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,650
Yeah.

229
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,770
I somehow have stashes of candy.

230
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,670
I don't know why.

231
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,250
I don't...

232
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,450
They're like hard candy.

233
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,790
I don't even like hard candy.

234
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,050
I don't know why they exist.

235
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:53,650
Okay.

236
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,860
Dying to what?

237
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,520
Oh wow.

238
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,800
It sounds so weird.

239
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,160
Um...

240
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
Dying to...

241
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,720
My headphones.

242
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,320
Because I'm wearing my glasses today.

243
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,440
And they put too much pressure on my face.

244
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,980
You knew.

245
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,280
Thank you so much for the time gifted.

246
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,920
Thank you.

247
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,540
All right.

248
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
That was a journey.

249
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,060
And you know what will also be a journey is...

250
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,760
Today's stream.

251
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,830
Why did I sound...

252
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,520
Okay.

253
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Whatever.

254
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,280
Shady!

255
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,740
Happy birthday!

256
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,860
Thank you so much for the time gifted.

257
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,980
Thank you.

258
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,820
Thank you.

259
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,240
Thank you.

260
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,320
Thank you so much.

261
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,220
Happy birthday.

262
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,820
All righty, guys.

263
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,760
Are we ready to continue?

264
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,100
I got to connect my controller again.

265
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,860
Boop.

266
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,280
Boop.

267
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,860
Look.

268
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
Why does it sound like it's disconnecting...

269
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,120
When it's connecting?

270
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,860
You're so confusing.

271
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,500
All right.

272
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,220
Continue.

273
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,400
Devil may cry.

274
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,060
Judging my...

275
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,560
I can't read anything.

276
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,620
Game is too fast.

277
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,820
Did we watch this?

278
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,340
Oh.

279
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,160
Guess there's no point thinking about it.

280
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Yes, we did.

281
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,380
That's okay.

282
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,080
We'll watch it again.

283
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,780
Nico is so cute.

284
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,620
Ew.

285
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,260
Flirting with me?

286
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,660
Knock it off.

287
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,200
Get in the car.

288
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,740
Get in the car.

289
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,900
Get...

290
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,560
How do you...

291
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,060
Get...

292
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,040
Get in the car.

293
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,300
Oh my god.

294
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,140
You know what?

295
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,500
I think I've kind of finally put what she...

296
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,600
Who she reminds me of.

297
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
And I think it's K-Sun.

298
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,460
She reminds me of K-Sun.

299
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,120
Like in looks and also like...

300
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,820
Personality.

301
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,200
She's got the accent and everything.

302
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,020
She's so much like her.

303
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,480
I already like bags.

304
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,440
So put a small bag and a bag and a bigger bag.

305
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,300
Inside a larger bag.

306
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,960
Inside another bag.

307
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,540
Inside a bag.

308
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,580
So we're not doing a Vito compliment.

309
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,380
Now I can't unsee it.

310
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,560
Oh my god.

311
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:08,920
Lady.

312
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,400
Hi, lady.

313
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,080
Hi, lady.

314
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,060
Alright.

315
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,140
I lost...

316
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,880
I lost a lot of irons last time.

317
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,340
I think.

318
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,640
Oh, golly.

319
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,480
Okay.

320
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,080
Let's see.

321
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,320
Do I have any?

322
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,680
I might be able to buy some.

323
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,360
Oh, we have some more we can add in there.

324
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,460
Perfect.

325
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,440
Pilter, skelter.

326
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,680
Minto condiments.

327
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,800
A little bit of ketchup.

328
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,560
A little bit of...

329
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,380
Oh my gosh.

330
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,240
Remember how they used to make like purple ketchup?

331
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,580
They make...

332
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:52,840
Wait.

333
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,280
They made a green ketchup.

334
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:54,840
No?

335
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,340
They'll make a...

336
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,840
They'll make a mint ketchup.

337
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,640
That lady smell.

338
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,540
What?

339
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah.

340
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,960
A long time ago.

341
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,900
They were like...

342
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,760
Look at this kooky, wacky ketchup.

343
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
And it was purple.

344
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,600
And then...

345
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh, they made the Shrek ketchup for...

346
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,820
Or...

347
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,360
The green ketchup was for Shrek.

348
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,140
Oh, I didn't realize.

349
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,300
But yeah.

350
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,060
So then they made a green ketchup.

351
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,560
Turn...

352
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,080
Wait.

353
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,680
It was bad for you?

354
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,460
So like pretty potties.

355
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,180
Oh, probably.

356
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,760
Probably, probably.

357
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,420
Alright, let's jump into the void real quick for me to just...

358
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,780
Just...

359
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,880
Get a little bit, you know.

360
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm a bag playing a bag disguised as...

361
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,840
Another bag.

362
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
Wait, which one is it?

363
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,360
There we go.

364
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,120
Where...

365
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,560
Was it?

366
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,180
This one?

367
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,820
Hold on.

368
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,780
Wait.

369
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,200
No, no, no.

370
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,520
Exit real quick.

371
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:03,900
I wanna...

372
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,160
Oh, wait.

373
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:04,880
No, no, no.

374
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,340
Let me see my skill list real quick.

375
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,420
Um...

376
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,560
Um...

377
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,380
Okay.

378
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,880
Uh...

379
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,780
Oh, this is blue rose.

380
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,240
Hold on.

381
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:16,880
Red queen.

382
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,960
Why, why, why, why, why?

383
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,280
Then why?

384
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,820
Then the...

385
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,860
Okay, so out on the ground.

386
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,820
Okay, let me see.

387
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,920
No, I'm not doing it well.

388
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
There we go.

389
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,540
It's such a long pause.

390
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,080
It's such a long pause.

391
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,060
I can't ever remember.

392
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,220
Oh, I don't know why I did that.

393
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,800
Oh,

394
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,980
the X seed.

395
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,960
Oh, what am I using now?

396
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,420
Oh, Gerbera.

397
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,200
I don't know.

398
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,500
Wait.

399
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:08,860
Hold on.

400
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,460
And then this one does...

401
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,540
Oh, ragtime.

402
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,560
Ragtime does, like, the little balls.

403
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,320
And then you can make all of time stop.

404
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,040
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,100
What was it to get rid of a...

406
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,460
It was, um...

407
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:39,760
Elf?

408
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,300
Yeah.

409
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,340
Punchline.

410
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,460
This one is...

411
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,060
Then we can call it back.

412
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,380
Okay.

413
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,040
Punchline.

414
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,280
Okay.

415
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,060
I think I'm good.

416
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,060
I think I'm okay.

417
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,300
I'll get...

418
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,520
I'll get back into it, probably.

419
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,280
It's that water, though.

420
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,740
Yeah, the rocket punch.

421
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,640
Hmm.

422
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,660
I think I'm okay for now.

423
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,080
What was my...

424
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,460
Let's see.

425
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,420
What would we have?

426
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,880
Oh, yeah.

427
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,640
Gerbera.

428
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,500
I'm gonna switch.

429
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,140
Let's switch it so that...

430
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,360
Let's switch these.

431
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,500
We'll have a punchline.

432
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,600
Actually...

433
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,860
I'm gonna have a helter-skelter, maybe.

434
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,600
Wait, I don't know.

435
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,800
He has a doorknob arm.

436
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,360
Ah.

437
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,420
Maybe I should just buy some.

438
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,060
Oh.

439
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,540
Wait.

440
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,780
What did Tomboy do again?

441
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,560
Oh, the bustle...

442
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,660
They're so expensive.

443
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,800
Do they also get more expen...

444
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,780
Wait, Rawhide.

445
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,960
Have I tried this one yet?

446
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,170
Always rev.

447
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:08,730
That's right.

448
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,130
That's right.

449
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,590
That's right.

450
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,010
Buy in bulk.

451
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,130
Buy one of each.

452
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,190
Ah.

453
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:21,990
Rawhide is the whip.

454
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,490
Oh.

455
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,710
Yes, yes, yes.

456
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,130
Thank you.

457
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,710
Yes, yes, yes.

458
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:34,690
Um.

459
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,140
Is it?

460
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,900
Is the...

461
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,460
Do these...

462
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,000
So if I buy one, will it, like, increase the price for the next time I buy it?

463
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,740
Yeah, there will be arms in the level.

464
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,480
You know what?

465
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,040
Because of that, we'll...

466
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,520
Uh.

467
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
We'll get rid of...

468
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,220
We'll keep some of these at home.

469
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,280
Wait, go back.

470
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,660
How do I remove you?

471
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,980
Remove.

472
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,960
There we go.

473
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,380
I'm even gonna remove ragtime because...

474
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,460
I don't feel like I know how to use it well enough.

475
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,820
No?

476
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,680
Oh, okay.

477
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,120
Wait.

478
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,620
No.

479
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,480
Maybe...

480
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,790
I'm like, we could buy Tomboy or Rawhide.

481
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,130
Oh.

482
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,030
Tomboy is kind of nice to have.

483
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,580
You can get them for free, though.

484
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,020
We'll see what's in the level.

485
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,560
We'll just see what's in the level and see what...

486
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,940
see what we can grab.

487
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,980
For now, I have three.

488
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,340
All right.

489
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,360
Mission eight.

490
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,660
I think someone said this.

491
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,820
Or people were saying that this mission is a little...

492
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,760
a little...

493
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,880
uh...

494
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,500
longer.

495
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,800
So, let's get it out.

496
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,580
I just want to start it.

497
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,060
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,360
It doesn't even look like we're in the city anymore.

499
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,320
Not that that was ever an option.

500
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,440
Yeah.

501
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,320
Yeah.

502
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,260
Time for some payback.

503
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,220
Oh, yeah.

504
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,960
All right.

505
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,980
Just you wait, you big bastard.

506
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,960
I'll drag you all the way down here.

507
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,080
I know this is where we came from, but...

508
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,780
Nothing?

509
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,360
Nothing?

510
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:43,780
Okay.

511
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,240
Oh, my God.

512
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,080
The city is totally...

513
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,880
Nothing?

514
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,320
I can't tell what...

515
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,060
Oh, there's some...

516
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,340
roar bees there.

517
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,420
Noice.

518
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,240
Onwards.

519
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,740
The city has become a tree.

520
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,080
Oh.

521
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,000
What is that?

522
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,000
What the hell?

523
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
This is bad.

524
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,450
Noice.

525
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,130
Yeah.

526
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,290
Noice.

527
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,370
Doesn't look any worse than...

528
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,530
Whoa.

529
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,190
Oh, wait.

530
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,930
This does look pretty bad, actually.

531
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,290
Holy cow.

532
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,010
Oh.

533
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,430
Oh, my God.

534
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,750
I was going to say, it doesn't look...

535
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,030
Any worse than before, I suppose, but...

536
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,110
Yeah.

537
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,990
It's not looking great for our little...

538
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,210
For our little city.

539
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,130
It's not looking...

540
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,050
Not looking...

541
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,210
Too hot.

542
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,450
Just Florida?

543
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,750
Oh, my God.

544
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,790
Everything's pulsing.

545
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,830
Whoa.

546
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,390
Okay.

547
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,230
Who?

548
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,890
Where?

549
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,090
Whomst?

550
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,910
Oh, there they are.

551
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,130
Come here.

552
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,590
Oh, he's already dead.

553
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,850
Uh, hold on.

554
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,690
Oh, wait.

555
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,410
Wait.

556
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,670
There we are.

557
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,370
What if we kiss into the giant...

558
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,510
Undulating, veiny, demon tree heart?

559
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,250
Wow.

560
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,730
Any takers?

561
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,230
Any...

562
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,050
What the?

563
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,730
The music is freaky.

564
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,230
Any takers?

565
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,590
Making sure I don't miss anything.

566
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,790
If I miss something...

567
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,390
Um, you can say...

568
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,530
Go back.

569
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,850
Me to hole.

570
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,070
Oh, this looks like a...

571
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,370
Big ol' area for...

572
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,690
Battle.

573
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,190
Goal.

574
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,370
Oy.

575
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:29,850
Come here.

576
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:33,870
Oh, my God.

577
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,450
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

578
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,100
Ow.

579
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,720
Down, down, down, down, down.

580
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

581
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,060
Just kill it.

582
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,420
Just kill it till it's dead.

583
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,880
Owww, John.

584
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,300
I knew that was gonna happen.

585
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,520
Come in.

586
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,980
Come in.

587
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,480
Come in.

588
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,200
Oh, my God.

589
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:28,880
Oh, my God.

590
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,900
Yeah.

591
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,270
Come in.

592
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:40,930
Come in.

593
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,730
Told you you were in Florida, with the gators.

594
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,450
We got them gators.

595
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,170
Yeah, they never stood a chance.

596
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,430
So true, Nero.

597
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,750
He believes in me.

598
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,070
Why is this light lit up?

599
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,830
Makes me want to explore.

600
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,570
It makes me want to explore.

601
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:16,990
No.

602
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,830
This looks like a big old area for battle the whole game.

603
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,110
Well, oh, there's something sparkly there.

604
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,310
Oh.

605
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,220
Okay.

606
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,060
Oh no.

607
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,080
What is?

608
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,520
The lava?

609
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,360
Oh, nice.

610
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,520
We got a new Gerbera.

611
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,460
We'll take it.

612
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,460
Uh.

613
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,920
Oh.

614
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,100
I guess that's your... Run.

615
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,980
No, bus!

616
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,660
Please!

617
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,920
Mr... Mr. Driver, please!

618
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,540
I'm gonna miss my stop.

619
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,040
Oh my god.

620
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,860
My depth perception strikes again.

621
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,880
Oh my depth perception.

622
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,460
Oh, wait.

623
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,500
Can you do another one?

624
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,820
Can you do another evil hand in the lava?

625
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,720
Please.

626
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,020
I missed the previous evil hand in the lava.

627
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,660
There we go.

628
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,300
Oh my god.

629
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,080
There we go.

630
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,940
Alrighty.

631
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,620
Wait, what's on... We're going to the other side, but what's on this side?

632
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,260
Oh my god.

633
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,220
It pays to be curious.

634
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,260
Literally.

635
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,170
Okay.

636
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,490
La-la-la-la-la-la-bla!

637
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,250
Ta-ta-ta-ta-gain!

638
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,510
Would be fun to come up with a story of...

639
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,090
...why there are loads of robotic arms just lying around.

640
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,590
I believe that it's just Niko kind of like...

641
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,430
...chucking them.

642
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,370
You know?

643
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:11,930
Just to, you know, she's... She's just like... And... Just kind of throws him out into the... Wow, there's a lot of warb... Things here.

644
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,350
Wait, what's this?

645
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,470
Oh, I grab my... I grab arms here, right?

646
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,150
Yeah.

647
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:27,950
Oh, wait, no, I gotta... But where's it taking me?

648
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,870
The shootin' yet.

649
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,770
Oh, there's one up there.

650
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,240
Wait.

651
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,280
We got it.

652
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,640
We got it, boys.

653
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,920
We got it, boys.

654
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,080
No worries.

655
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,260
No worries here.

656
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,180
Do you think, um...

657
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,180
Do you think this is gonna cause the neighborhood market to go down?

658
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,840
The housing, you know... Oh, oh.

659
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,540
Oh.

660
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,280
Oh, these guys again.

661
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,040
Don't get me.

662
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,720
Don't strike me.

663
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,620
Oh.

664
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,580
Oh.

665
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Oh, oh.

666
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,510
Oh, yeah.

667
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,710
Yeah, that's right.

668
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,630
That's right.

669
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,770
I like that they give you health.

670
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,750
It's pretty...

671
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,870
Pretty special.

672
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,490
In this economy...

673
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,470
Bloodstreams.

674
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,870
I was just about to say, what the heck is that?

675
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,070
These conduits snake throughout the...

676
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,450
Cliffoth.

677
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,650
Transporting blood gathered in the human world.

678
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,330
Offer yourself to the flow.

679
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,470
And it will carry you deep into the tree.

680
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,630
But be warned.

681
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,310
There's no turning back once ye enter.

682
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,310
Where does this go?

683
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,770
Yeah, that's a great question.

684
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,450
Okay.

685
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,750
Wait.

686
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,430
That's totally something...

687
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,050
No?

688
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,710
Never mind.

689
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,950
It's totally nothing.

690
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,350
Did I get everything then?

691
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,450
I think we're good, right?

692
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,010
One with the flow.

693
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,510
Oh, my God.

694
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,490
Oh, well.

695
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,470
Whoa.

696
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,830
Go behind it.

697
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:47,930
Something behind.

698
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,850
Thank you, guys.

699
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,290
All right.

700
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,350
Thank you, thank you.

701
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,530
Perfect.

702
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,370
Howdy doody.

703
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,870
We're entering the tree.

704
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,990
Oh.

705
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:10,870
Oh.

706
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,290
Oh, my God.

707
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,090
I think it tastes like a pomegranate or something.

708
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,500
Holy cow.

709
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,000
Badass.

710
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,140
Badass dread.

711
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,340
Cool.

712
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,580
That was really...

713
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,340
That was kind of sickening.

714
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,620
That was so nasty.

715
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,940
I don't think I ever want to go through that.

716
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,560
I see.

717
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,840
I think I see an arm.

718
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,860
Wait, but I really like...

719
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,280
I actually really like rawhide.

720
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,100
Ra...

721
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,620
Ra...

722
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,340
Ra...

723
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,080
Hide.

724
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,360
Punch down.

725
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,540
So many arms.

726
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't think there's any warbs.

727
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,300
We can turn it up.

728
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:18,720
Oh.

729
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,710
Nice.

730
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:28,950
Oh.

731
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:29,850
Oh.

732
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,560
Wait, I want to...

733
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,920
There we go.

734
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,820
Yeah.

735
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,570
Wait.

736
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:06,170
Wait.

737
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,210
No.

738
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:06,650
Take it.

739
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,920
Oh, there's more of them.

740
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, no.

741
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,500
It's this guy.

742
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,360
Oh, no.

743
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,480
Oh, no.

744
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,740
Yeah.

745
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:16,840
Yeah.

746
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

747
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,580
Oh, my God.

748
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,440
What's happening?

749
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,440
Aaaaaah!

750
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,420
Okay.

751
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,560
Damn.

752
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,540
All the way down.

753
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,240
Too heavy, huh?

754
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,980
You guys are too fat!

755
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,840
No!

756
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,200
You're too fat!

757
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,860
What the hell is that?

758
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:47,960
I

759
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,990
don't like that thing.

760
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,410
I don't want that thing.

761
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,470
I don't want that thing around me.

762
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,470
I don't want that thing...

763
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,390
I'm getting away from it.

764
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,250
I'm getting these guys first.

765
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,890
Oh my god.

766
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,450
Just like Mata.

767
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,790
Yeah, actually.

768
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,890
Does feel pretty... reminiscent of her, huh?

769
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,790
There we go.

770
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,050
Okay, now we can fight it.

771
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,530
Okay.

772
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,810
Go arm, go!

773
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,670
So funny.

774
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,120
It's kind of slow, actually.

775
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,480
It's actually not even...

776
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,500
I'm just attacking its butt.

777
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,120
Dodge!

778
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,460
Dodge!

779
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:00,940
No!

780
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,740
Oh no.

781
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,220
Oh no.

782
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:02,660
Oh.

783
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,380
There we go.

784
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,590
Wait, oh.

785
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,470
I didn't even get a little bit.

786
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,350
I didn't even get a little bit.

787
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,070
Oh my god, please!

788
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,570
There we go.

789
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,360
Attack its supple behind.

790
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,740
Attack its supple behind.

791
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,400
Well, we made it.

792
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,920
With minimal... minimal damage.

793
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,660
I think we're okay.

794
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,640
And there's another arm for us.

795
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,980
After we just lost ours.

796
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,160
How kind of them.

797
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,660
Overture.

798
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:53,960
Nice.

799
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,460
It was a good thing I didn't bring any more arms.

800
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:56,900
I don't know.

801
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,320
Are these people?

802
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,420
Oops.

803
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,970
Don't attack the bakery!

804
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,410
That's the best part, though.

805
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,010
Right now.

806
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:11,450
Yeah.

807
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,330
I killed them?

808
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:15,790
Oh yeah.

809
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:16,430
Oh yeah.

810
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,170
It's totally my fault.

811
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,270
It's totally my doing.

812
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,390
Uh...

813
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,010
Oh wait.

814
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:27,730
I'm so stupid.

815
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,630
I forgot to...

816
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,210
I forgot to lock on.

817
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:30,690
There we go.

818
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:33,990
Whee!

819
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:34,990
Yeah.

820
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,030
It's totally my doing that they're in this predicament.

821
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,030
I guess so.

822
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:42,810
Don't miss!

823
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,210
Wait, I saw some...

824
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,350
I saw some over here.

825
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,510
Wait, can I get the...

826
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:51,630
Oh.

827
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:54,370
Nice!

828
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,650
I feel like saving this.

829
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:02,850
Just in case I need it.

830
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,310
Wait, what are these?

831
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,150
Nothing?

832
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,430
They look so cool, though.

833
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,490
Okay, maybe I'm not.

834
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:12,750
Okay.

835
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,650
I thought we were about to be ambushed, though.

836
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,430
I'll just take it, then.

837
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:16,770
Okay.

838
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:19,510
Orbs.

839
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,710
Oh, here we go.

840
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,030
While riding punchline, you can press X to attack.

841
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,830
You need to go in the air while airborne with the left stick direction.

842
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,090
What?

843
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,430
Boss?

844
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,650
A boss fight?

845
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,290
Uh-oh.

846
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:35,810
Oh.

847
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,210
What?

848
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,210
Oh, I- Sorry, I just- what?

849
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:38,450
Yeah!

850
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,550
What?

851
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:43,270
Balfelmet!

852
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,390
Oh my god.

853
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,300
Balfelmet!

854
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,060
What are you, Pokemon?

855
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,500
Come here.

856
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,020
Can I grab you over here?

857
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,200
You're not so bad.

858
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,180
You're not so tough.

859
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, wait.

860
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,800
Oh, wait.

861
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,640
You really weren't.

862
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:23,720
Uh-oh.

863
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,480
Are there going to be three more of you?

864
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,740
Jump, jump, jump away.

865
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,740
Oh, my God.

866
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,920
And another one of you.

867
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,860
Oh, my God.

868
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,820
You sneaky.

869
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,980
Stay away from me.

870
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,440
Where are you guys?

871
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,200
Trying to do the...

872
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,620
There we go.

873
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,160
Oh, oh, gosh.

874
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,140
Ew, you...

875
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,790
Nice parry.

876
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,350
Thank you.

877
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:31,590
Yeah.

878
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,190
Yeah.

879
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:34,630
Take him down.

880
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,090
That guy doesn't do so well against guns, I think.

881
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,650
Music toco.

882
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:47,290
I don't know.

883
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:48,450
That's a good question.

884
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,610
Jar Jar Binks went to the dark side.

885
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,750
Jar Jar Binks.

886
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:57,990
That guy.

887
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,050
Okay.

888
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,310
That wasn't so bad.

889
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:02,410
Oh.

890
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,590
Another...

891
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,230
Another elevator.

892
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,230
Let's check behind it.

893
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,170
Where's he going to take me now?

894
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,450
Oh.

895
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,090
Oh, wait.

896
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:13,710
What is this?

897
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:15,250
Sneaky!

898
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,930
Sneaky...

899
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,460
Sneaky...

900
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,150
Darth Jar Jar.

901
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,230
A little pit.

902
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,810
This...

903
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,450
This...

904
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:33,810
This...

905
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,370
This...

906
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,850
These warbs are the pits.

907
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:37,710
The pit.

908
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,800
These warbs are...

909
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,260
In the pit.

910
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,100
Wait, what's over here?

911
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,200
Nothing.

912
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,600
Okay, let's go.

913
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,370
I kind of want to eat this.

914
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,670
Like, it looks horrible and disgusting.

915
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,870
But if I think of it as like a delicious pomegranate...

916
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,950
It looks so like fruity and juicy and delicious, no?

917
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,070
I kind of want to eat it.

918
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,390
No way.

919
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,050
Uh-oh.

920
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,690
What are we about?

921
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:06,050
Oh, no.

922
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,610
Divinity statues.

923
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,190
Use divinity statues to trade red orbs for skill.

924
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,310
Wait, so we don't have Nico anymore?

925
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,650
Literal forbidden fruit?

926
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,110
Sparkly.

927
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,510
The car can't get in here.

928
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,790
I have faith in her.

929
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,830
I have faith in her.

930
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:37,670
Oh.

931
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:38,570
Whoa.

932
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:40,270
Whoa.

933
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,390
Let's see.

934
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,610
Let's see what we can grab here.

935
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,490
Why, why?

936
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,210
Pause.

937
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:53,810
Why, why, why?

938
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,950
I think I won't even do it.

939
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,050
I can't even...

940
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,850
I can't even get B correctly.

941
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,230
I try.

942
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,630
I don't...

943
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,610
He's putting enough spaces in between the Ys.

944
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,560
Oh, wait.

945
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,020
Payline might be good, huh?

946
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,120
Exceed.

947
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,600
We could do more Exceed.

948
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,160
If I...

949
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,240
And we can do more Breaker.

950
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,100
We can...

951
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,640
Let's see.

952
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,960
Maybe I'll do Payline and...

953
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,220
Oh.

954
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,390
Back to forward.

955
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,290
Okay, I'm going to do Payline.

956
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,960
Got some good news.

957
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,940
My hopefully last surgery has been scheduled.

958
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,260
Brandon!

959
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,680
This could be my last surgery to get my chronic pain under control.

960
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,420
I hope so!

961
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,560
Oh!

962
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,460
Good luck with everything.

963
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,080
Payline is fun.

964
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,680
Combo C, good.

965
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,620
Oh, this one.

966
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,500
Why, why?

967
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,180
Pause.

968
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,140
A flashy sword combo.

969
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,040
Yeah, let's try it.

970
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,540
Come here, buddy.

971
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,620
Come here.

972
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,740
Come here, buddy.

973
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:34,950
Was that it?

974
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,250
No, but then the other one, he like, pushes him away.

975
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,330
Oh wait, that was it?

976
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,850
Oh, that's it?

977
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:49,590
Oh.

978
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,670
I didn't finish it.

979
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:57,910
Oh.

980
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,370
Oh, okay.

981
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:02,790
That's...

982
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,150
I think it's just easier to spam Y than...

983
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,910
Just be like, why, why, why, why?

984
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:13,890
Oh, I...

985
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,090
Wait, hold on.

986
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,090
No, no, stop, stop.

987
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,590
Nope, nope, nope.

988
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:20,810
Not enough time, okay.

989
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,330
Like that.

990
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,150
Can I ask for a small favor?

992
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,050
Can I keep my dog company while I go to work?

993
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,330
Oh.

994
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,350
Just call out Jonesy every time he pees on the carpet.

995
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,790
Oh, why, why is your dog peeing on the carpet?

996
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:43,890
Jonesy!

997
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,250
Jonesy!

998
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,090
Jonesy!

999
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:48,210
Pull my down on track.

1000
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,550
Oh, I keep doing that.

1001
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:59,350
I don't know why.

1002
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,090
Quit the void.

1003
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,600
Usually, once you've done the pause, it's easier to just spam Y.

1004
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,940
I mean, it's cheap.

1005
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,420
I guess I could learn it.

1006
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,300
And it's just another combo to have that I might accidentally end up doing.

1007
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,840
Wait.

1008
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,020
But then also I can...

1009
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,640
Oh, wait.

1010
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,800
What I can do...

1011
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,350
What I can do is I can do...

1012
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,250
Breaker plus three and then also more exceed.

1013
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,570
I think that might be good.

1014
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,070
Because then I can hold more arms.

1015
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,410
More arms.

1016
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:58,790
Okay.

1017
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,110
Now we go to exceed.

1018
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,470
And I just gotta use exceed.

1019
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:05,490
Okay.

1020
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:06,590
Just gotta...

1021
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:06,790
Wait.

1022
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,430
What did it say?

1023
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,950
Press and hold LT several times.

1024
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:13,270
Okay.

1025
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:36,290
Onward!

1026
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,770
Quit the void, my therapist.

1027
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,170
Oh.

1028
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:42,930
Oh.

1029
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:43,750
Oh.

1030
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,510
Oh, these guys!

1031
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:55,570
Oh.

1032
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,610
Okay.

1033
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:06,730
Yeah, baby!

1034
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,050
Oh, shoot.

1035
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,950
Oh, I forgot.

1036
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,750
Oh, I forgot again.

1037
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,370
I forgot again!

1038
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:15,650
There we go.

1039
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:16,870
Woo!

1040
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:20,870
They died.

1041
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:23,690
Is that...

1042
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,810
How this is supposed to go?

1043
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:28,070
Or am I like causing myself more grief by not killing these guys fast enough?

1044
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:29,390
Oh.

1045
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:39,770
Nice!

1046
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,750
Oh my god!

1047
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:57,630
Where did you come from?

1048
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,310
Nice!

1049
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:16,890
Terminate!

1050
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:17,570
Oh.

1051
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:26,830
Why I'm jumping so high?

1052
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,190
There we go, finally.

1053
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,270
You wanna try that again, buddy?

1054
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,450
You wanna keep trying that, buddy?

1055
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,290
I can't see you anymore.

1056
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,330
Come on.

1057
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:57,900
Come on.

1058
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,710
Yeah, kick his butt!

1059
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,370
What are you doing?

1060
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:13,730
Woo!

1061
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:14,810
Oh my god.

1062
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,610
Yeah.

1063
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,530
Oh, shoot!

1064
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,370
Oh, damn.

1065
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,010
Finally, you hit me once.

1066
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:24,370
Oops!

1067
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:25,550
Okay, you hit me twice.

1068
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,590
Shame on me.

1069
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:39,130
Yeah!

1070
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,030
Oh my god.

1071
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:43,730
How much...

1072
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,170
Yeah!

1073
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,090
Oh my gosh.

1074
00:55:59,090 --> 00:55:59,770
Haha.

1075
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,170
Oh.

1076
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:04,910
Victory!

1077
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,370
Breaker!

1078
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,090
Oh my gosh.

1079
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,790
I didn't use my arm even once.

1080
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:11,790
I'm so stupid.

1081
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,830
I just realized that I was so focused on...

1082
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:17,650
on...

1083
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,890
on revving.

1084
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,030
I didn't even...

1085
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,730
I didn't even use my arm.

1086
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:22,250
Whatever.

1087
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:22,910
I'm too good.

1088
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,570
I'm too good.

1089
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,530
I don't even need it.

1090
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:31,370
I'm too good.

1091
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:31,950
Road divided.

1092
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,130
Let's go this way first.

1093
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:38,330
Haha.

1094
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:41,070
Oh.

1095
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:41,990
Dead end.

1096
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,410
So many mechanics in this game, man.

1097
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,290
I know, right?

1098
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,630
Holy cannoli.

1099
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,740
As soon as I'm like...

1100
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,730
remembering one thing...

1101
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:54,770
and I add another thing.

1102
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,490
And then I remember another thing...

1103
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:58,570
and then I add another thing.

1104
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:58,930
Haha.

1105
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,890
And then I'm like...

1106
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,470
Okay, I'll focus on this one thing...

1107
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:01,950
and then...

1108
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:02,490
I'm like...

1109
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:03,870
Oh, I'm neglecting another thing.

1110
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:04,390
Haha.

1111
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,370
But hey...

1112
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,490
I still did it.

1113
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:10,990
Alright, let's go.

1114
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,610
Delicious!

1115
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,010
Delicious!

1116
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,210
I wanna be buried in whatever that stuff is.

1117
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,350
There are no express elevators.

1118
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,330
Someone's a lousy architect.

1119
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:27,830
Ooh!

1120
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:29,530
Barbara!

1121
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,270
Why is the music kinda somber?

1122
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,010
Get in the blood goop.

1123
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:46,610
Oh, this looks like...

1124
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,130
But yeah, I...

1125
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,630
I think I asked earlier...

1126
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,550
and I didn't see if...

1127
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,010
I couldn't...

1128
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:52,930
Sorry, I couldn't check chat.

1129
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:53,470
But like...

1130
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:53,930
when the...

1131
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,510
when the thing drops...

1132
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,590
is that what's supposed to happen?

1133
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,090
Or am I supposed to defeat them...

1134
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,090
really, really quickly?

1135
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,510
That's DMC file.

1136
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,470
It never stops adding things.

1137
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:07,770
It's timed.

1138
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,970
Oh, you missed a blurb!

1139
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,130
Oh...

1140
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,990
It's an act-time event for extra orbs and stuff.

1141
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,290
Oh...

1142
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:14,990
Okay, okay, okay.

1143
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,230
Ah, whatever.

1144
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:19,910
Hello?

1145
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:20,850
Anybody?

1146
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:21,950
Nobody?

1147
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:23,690
How you doing, Dante?

1148
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:24,830
I mean...

1149
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,370
Nero?

1150
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,450
Oops, sorry, my bad.

1151
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,010
Wait, where...

1152
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:27,510
Oh, there they are.

1153
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:30,550
Where is...

1154
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,730
How is Dante doing?

1155
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,470
We don't even know where that guy is.

1156
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,810
It's funny, I even love Nero so much!

1157
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,510
I'm so used to saying Dante!

1158
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,030
The disrespect...

1159
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:48,650
I'm sorry!

1160
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,110
Oh, that was...

1161
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:52,490
Hello?

1162
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:53,550
Die!

1163
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:06,930
Oh...

1164
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:09,690
Why, why?

1165
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:10,830
Why, why?

1166
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,090
Oh...

1167
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,550
Why, wait...

1168
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,170
Why, why?

1169
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,450
Why, why?

1170
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:18,530
Oh...

1171
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:19,150
I'm too good.

1172
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,290
I keep sending them flying away.

1173
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:22,270
Come here.

1174
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,110
Oh, I can't grab you.

1175
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,670
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

1176
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:39,610
Longer pause?

1177
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:40,110
Why?

1178
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:40,670
Oh, wait.

1179
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:41,410
No, it's...

1180
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:41,670
Oh.

1181
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,830
I did buy that one!

1182
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:51,530
Oh, no, wait.

1183
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,230
I didn't buy it.

1184
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,470
Wait, I didn't buy the...

1185
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,090
I didn't buy that one, did I?

1186
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,290
It's okay, I'll buy it next time.

1187
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:58,550
You're right, you're right.

1188
00:59:58,610 --> 00:59:59,350
I didn't buy it.

1189
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,510
Cut!

1190
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:01,110
Oops.

1191
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,150
I didn't even buy it.

1192
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,630
And here I am, trying...

1193
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,410
Oopsie!

1194
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:18,590
Wait.

1195
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,050
Stop!

1196
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:22,750
There we go.

1197
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:27,830
Wait, can I?

1198
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:28,690
Hold on.

1199
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:30,990
Hold on.

1200
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,470
Hold on.

1201
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:33,790
I want to try something real quick.

1202
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,350
Can I do it twice?

1203
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,270
Oh, I can!

1204
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:39,030
Okay.

1205
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,350
Funny thing is that Nero's VA Johnny Young Bosch also voices Dante in the new series.

1206
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:45,490
That's confusing!

1207
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,590
I was trying to place...

1208
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:56,470
You know, I know Johnny Young Bosch is in, like, so much and he's in, like, everything.

1209
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:01,690
But I was still trying to place where I've heard his, like, Nero voice before.

1210
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:08,730
There's, like, somewhere that I'm, like, I really recognize him.

1211
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,510
No, I didn't watch Bleach.

1212
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,810
I didn't play Persona 4.

1213
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:20,290
I don't know.

1214
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,940
Probably DMC4.

1215
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:24,190
What?

1216
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,330
That makes no sense.

1217
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,630
Lelouch?

1218
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:28,230
No, I didn't watch...

1219
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,610
I didn't watch Kokiyosh.

1220
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,410
Power Rangers?

1221
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:38,660
Maybe...

1222
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,500
Trigun?

1223
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:40,880
Maybe.

1224
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,100
Who was he in Trigun?

1225
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,630
Oh, Vash.

1226
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:52,730
Oh, maybe that then.

1227
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,450
Where's the ambush?

1228
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:58,690
Ambush?

1229
01:01:58,930 --> 01:01:59,990
Where's the ambush?

1230
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:00,850
Ambush?

1231
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:01,490
Really?

1232
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:01,970
No ambush?

1233
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:02,650
Nothing.

1234
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:03,650
No ambush?

1235
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,090
Oh.

1236
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:06,550
Oh!

1237
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,610
Scared me.

1238
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,310
They punished me for... Oh!

1239
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,310
They didn't punish me.

1240
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,730
They didn't punish me.

1241
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:21,010
Aw, the game is nice.

1242
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:32,890
This is my favorite way to... This is my favorite way to do it, but I have it so, like... It's so touchy.

1243
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,150
Never punished.

1244
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,320
Alright.

1245
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:45,800
Good.

1246
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,400
Finally made it.

1247
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,460
Now, about that payback.

1248
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,500
About that payback.

1249
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:54,740
Oh.

1250
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,700
Let's get airport.

1251
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,580
Right now.

1252
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,280
Oh, I see an arm over there.

1253
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,320
Wait, does this break?

1254
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,500
The music is so cool.

1255
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,060
A phone here?

1256
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,680
Does it still work?

1257
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,380
No way!

1258
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,320
Wait!

1259
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,180
No way!

1260
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,100
Wait!

1261
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:15,660
Let's get airborne.

1262
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,320
Oh.

1263
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,220
Nero, you need a shower, buddy.

1264
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,860
You stink!

1265
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:20,840
Boosh!

1266
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:21,500
Oh!

1267
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,500
So.

1268
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,160
Bero.

1269
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,420
Think you can make it all the way here?

1270
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,500
Duh!

1271
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,760
Who do you think you're talking to?

1272
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,620
See, I knew she'd be able to make it.

1273
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1274
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,560
Ha ha ha ha!

1275
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,620
Nero, you have a girlfriend!

1276
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,920
Oh, he was asleep.

1277
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,180
He wasn't even reading it.

1278
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,030
He was reading the articles.

1279
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:02,850
He's...

1280
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:04,370
He's such a loyal...

1281
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:05,210
Loyal guy.

1282
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:07,650
Wait.

1283
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,170
Come here.

1284
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:09,490
Yo!

1285
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:10,770
You just hear the window shop?

1286
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,130
Yup!

1287
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,110
Let's see.

1288
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,770
What can we...

1289
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:16,670
What was it?

1290
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,070
Let's see.

1291
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,410
Uh...

1292
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,550
Can I even afford it?

1293
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,370
I can!

1294
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,870
Okay, I'm gonna grab it.

1295
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:25,290
Wait, I have 7,000 Rorbs exactly.

1296
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:25,790
Wow.

1297
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,510
Combo C, baby.

1298
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:32,950
Combo C.

1299
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:33,950
What I can do.

1300
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,390
Alright.

1301
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:37,930
Now I'm gonna save up more for exceeds and for...

1302
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,650
More breakers.

1303
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,310
So...

1304
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,110
The...

1305
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,510
Would be good to also get this eventually.

1306
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:54,910
Might just be me, but for sword combos...

1307
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:58,830
I found it easier to look at the animation and imagine the tension in Nero's arms.

1308
01:04:59,310 --> 01:04:59,710
I...

1309
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:00,990
Alex, I've been...

1310
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:01,930
Actually, that's a good...

1311
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,530
Like, I've actually been kind of...

1312
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:04,210
Not...

1313
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,370
Like, noticing that too.

1314
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:07,030
Like, he kind of like...

1315
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,110
He's got like a...

1316
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,710
And then you do it, you know?

1317
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:12,050
I get what you mean.

1318
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:12,930
I get it.

1319
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,410
I get what you mean.

1320
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,010
Stare at Nero.

1321
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,090
Let's see if we can edit this.

1322
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:21,790
Cause...

1323
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,550
Um...

1324
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,250
I kind of want to switch Rawhide.

1325
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,090
With a Gerbera.

1326
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:27,670
We have so many Gerbera.

1327
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:28,950
Wow.

1328
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:33,590
Quit!

1329
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:34,450
Yes.

1330
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,530
The music's so cool.

1331
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,350
Do I go up here?

1332
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:43,190
Can I go up here?

1333
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,230
Yes, I can.

1334
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:53,530
Wait, come on.

1335
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:05,020
Roller.

1336
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,400
Oh, wait.

1337
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,420
Nice.

1338
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,620
Nice!

1339
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,500
Whoa!

1340
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,200
Oh, where did you come from?

1341
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,020
Where did you come from?

1342
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,020
Yeah, get out of my sight.

1343
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:39,600
Nice.

1344
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,980
That's it?

1345
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,980
Is there anything over here?

1346
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,740
Oh, I think I go... Okay, hold on.

1347
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,440
Before we do that, there was...

1348
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,580
down here, I wanted to check out.

1349
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:58,860
Over this way.

1350
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,220
And then I also see... I see that arm up there.

1351
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,340
Wait, which way do I go?

1352
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,940
This looks maybe like a dead end.

1353
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,440
I didn't miss the arm.

1354
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,920
I totally saw it.

1355
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,880
I 100% saw it.

1356
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,640
Why is it so blurry?

1357
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,140
Are my glasses okay?

1358
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:22,220
Okay.

1359
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,000
Oh, wait.

1360
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,140
But I can't even grab it.

1361
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,880
Because I already have full.

1362
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,600
So... I wish you could grab them... and store them.

1363
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,120
You know?

1364
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,820
That's my one thing.

1365
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,120
I've been kind of like...

1366
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:38,700
Aw, man.

1367
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,700
I wish you could grab them... and store them.

1368
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,100
Deposit?

1369
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:46,940
Wait, what do you mean?

1370
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,580
Oh, like I unequip.

1371
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,020
Oh, you're so right.

1372
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,020
Oh, that makes sense.

1373
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:53,440
Let's do that then.

1374
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:53,800
Yeah, yeah.

1375
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,720
And I'll put one here.

1376
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,040
You guys are so smart!

1377
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,440
Good plan.

1378
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,880
So we'll get rid of one Gerbera for another.

1379
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:04,580
Hahaha.

1380
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,480
If I can get up there.

1381
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,320
Oh.

1382
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,360
Come on, Nero.

1383
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,340
I believe in you.

1384
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:17,660
Oh, hey.

1385
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,740
I believe.

1386
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,760
I believe.

1387
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:23,600
Platforming.

1388
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:25,500
Okay.

1389
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:25,960
Alright.

1390
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,080
Nice and easy.

1391
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:28,460
Yeah!

1392
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,160
Hahaha.

1393
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,660
Don't forget taunt jump.

1394
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:33,680
Oh, yeah.

1395
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,080
I've been doing it like this whole time.

1396
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,120
I've been doing it this whole time, baby.

1397
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,700
Me, me, me.

1398
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,420
Me, me, me, me.

1399
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:44,900
Wow.

1400
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,140
Why is everything so blurry all of a sudden?

1401
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:47,900
Is it me?

1402
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,020
I feel like the...

1403
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,360
The atmosphere is getting a little crazy.

1404
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,380
Ugh!

1405
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:01,720
My eyes!

1406
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:08,740
Aw, shoot.

1407
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:10,840
Aw, shit.

1408
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,720
Is it some sort of motion blur?

1409
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,100
I don't think...

1410
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,980
I don't know why I haven't ever noticed it before.

1411
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:18,420
I think it's good to be king, huh?

1412
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,220
Not for much longer.

1413
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,040
Hehehehe.

1414
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,480
Can I turn this off?

1415
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,760
Game options, maybe?

1416
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:47,260
Controls?

1417
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,660
No.

1418
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,560
PC options.

1419
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,720
Graphics?

1420
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,700
Motion blur!

1421
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,680
We're... off.

1422
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,680
Holy cow.

1423
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:02,220
Okay.

1424
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:08,740
We are safe.

1425
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,720
Now we are safe.

1426
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:12,340
Wait.

1427
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:13,940
There we go.

1428
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,940
Bibicor, thank you so much for the gift of Deku!

1429
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,200
Aw, man.

1430
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,560
It's a tomboy!

1431
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,120
It looks like there's a boss battle in there, too.

1432
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,300
It's a tomboy!

1433
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,320
LB can smash.

1434
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,040
I know, but...

1435
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,820
Wait, let's see if we can go back.

1436
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,140
I don't want to waste.

1437
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,880
Being wasteful is... Oh, I don't think I can.

1438
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,500
No, there's no way.

1439
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,680
It's just one, Garbera!

1440
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,620
We can...

1441
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,860
It's just one...

1442
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,520
There we go.

1443
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:02,880
Okay.

1444
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,200
They give us so many of them.

1445
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,260
Hey, douchebag!

1446
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,460
Miss me?

1447
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,760
I can't believe we're back here already.

1448
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,140
Where's Dante?

1449
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,020
Yeah, where's Dante?

1450
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,000
Dried up Dante jerky?

1451
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:18,480
Nothing?

1452
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,940
You've come here to die.

1453
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,160
He talks.

1454
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:24,920
Your reason, huh?

1455
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,660
I bet your parents didn't like you much.

1456
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,220
Because your name sucks.

1457
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,020
I am without a name.

1458
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:36,760
I am power absolute.

1459
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,280
He looks so bored.

1460
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:38,880
No, no name.

1461
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,780
I'll be sure to put that on your tombstone.

1462
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,820
You will suffer and die.

1463
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,180
Is Dante...

1464
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,180
Is he like converted to bad...

1465
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:52,840
To a bad guy?

1466
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,080
I'll show you dead weight.

1467
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,940
Round two, baby.

1468
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:57,300
Maybe...

1469
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,040
Oh, gosh.

1470
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,140
Oh,

1471
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,430
my God!

1472
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,090
Holy cow!

1473
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,270
Okay.

1474
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:13,310
How do I...

1475
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:15,870
Oh, do I fight this thing?

1476
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,490
Oh, uh...

1477
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:20,210
That's about to...

1478
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:21,790
Oh, shoot.

1479
01:12:21,790 --> 01:12:22,770
I tried to dodge it.

1480
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:36,500
Whoa!

1481
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,220
Am I even doing damage?

1482
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,700
Oh, my God!

1483
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,460
I can't...

1484
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,120
I can't tell his moveset at all yet.

1485
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,860
What?

1486
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:10,200
Sorry.

1487
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,360
Wait.

1488
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,100
That's the ball.

1489
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:18,440
Okay.

1490
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,360
I got the ball.

1491
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:19,660
Okay.

1492
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:22,280
What the hell is that?

1493
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:22,480
Oh.

1494
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1495
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,020
That was okay.

1496
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,000
What-a-boo!

1497
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,420
Oh, no, no!

1498
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,300
Why does it have this little crystal thing?

1499
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,510
I was early.

1500
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:39,490
I was early.

1501
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,900
Is this even possible?

1502
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,040
Oh, wait.

1503
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,980
I just noticed how much health that thing has.

1504
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,180
No freaking way.

1505
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,000
I just noticed.

1506
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,300
Oh, my God.

1507
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:07,900
Wait, so I have to get rid of that.

1508
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,060
Oh, my God.

1509
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:10,540
Okay, wait.

1510
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,000
It might be better to stay away from it.

1511
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:14,360
No!

1512
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:18,200
Hold on.

1513
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:18,780
Let's redo.

1514
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,680
Let's redo.

1515
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,840
Are you okay?

1516
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,220
No, no, no.

1517
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:24,760
Let's give up.

1518
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,320
Yeah.

1519
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,500
Yeah, reset.

1520
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,020
Reset now that I...

1521
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:32,260
You should say QDA.

1522
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:33,400
It's okay.

1523
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,960
She'll... she's fine.

1524
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,640
He's covered in juice.

1525
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:40,540
Alright.

1526
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,300
Let's see.

1527
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,420
Oh, I'm all the way back here?

1528
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:48,780
Oof.

1529
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:49,420
Okay.

1530
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,940
That sucks.

1531
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,920
That sucks.

1532
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,700
Skip, please.

1533
01:14:58,920 --> 01:14:59,020
Okay.

1534
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,040
Let's, uh...

1535
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:03,300
Let's, uh...

1536
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,980
Go grab these, uh...

1537
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,620
Roar...

1538
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:09,920
But you already have a tomboy.

1539
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,360
Oh, yeah, I do.

1540
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:14,800
Okay.

1541
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,540
So, I don't know if I want to get so close to...

1542
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,960
Well, I guess I can get close to it.

1543
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,580
As long as it doesn't, like...

1544
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,000
It doesn't...

1545
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,180
It doesn't...

1546
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,460
In my face.

1547
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:28,720
No.

1548
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,260
Customize.

1549
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,860
Yo, you just here to window shop?

1550
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,760
Stab out.

1551
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,260
Yeah, yeah.

1552
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:33,980
Exactly.

1553
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,740
But it...

1554
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,420
But the gun was doing pretty good damage.

1555
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:39,080
Not gonna lie.

1556
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,340
Not gonna lie.

1557
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,640
It wasn't doing so bad.

1558
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,080
Let's put you away.

1559
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:49,960
And we'll grab...

1560
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,460
We'll just...

1561
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,320
This is a...

1562
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:52,700
Wait.

1563
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,720
Well, I have...

1564
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,620
Wait, hold on.

1565
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,300
Watch this.

1566
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,140
If that...

1567
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:00,720
If this...

1568
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,200
We still have this tomboy.

1569
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,560
But the Gerbera is back on the tree.

1570
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,280
That means the other tomboy is still there.

1571
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:06,880
No?

1572
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,460
Infinite...

1573
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,700
Infinite arm...

1574
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,520
Glitch.

1575
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,700
Infinite arm glitch, baby.

1576
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,020
Why wouldn't it be there?

1577
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,620
If this one's here.

1578
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:27,780
You know?

1579
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,400
Why wouldn't it be?

1580
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,080
Let's get airport.

1581
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,900
Right and high.

1582
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,680
Let's get airport.

1583
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,360
More robes, please.

1584
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:54,880
Ooh.

1585
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,420
Oh.

1586
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:01,680
Too good.

1587
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,540
Oh, this guy.

1588
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,600
Wait, come here.

1589
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,490
I think I got all of them.

1590
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:15,230
Okay.

1591
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,450
Onwards.

1592
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:22,390
Okay.

1593
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,010
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1594
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,250
Uh-oh.

1595
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:27,330
Right and high.

1596
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,330
Let's get airport.

1597
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:33,430
Let's get airport.

1598
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:34,770
Wait.

1599
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,140
Think it's good to be king, huh?

1600
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,840
You can run past, but why?

1601
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:46,300
It's not.

1602
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:46,620
They're not.

1603
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,080
They're just little babies.

1604
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,940
They don't do anything.

1605
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,120
Tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, tomboy.

1606
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:56,680
Time to see.

1607
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,140
See!

1608
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,580
Yeah, free robes are free robes.

1609
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:04,600
And they're easy bees.

1610
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,100
Easy, easy peasy.

1611
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,060
Okay.

1612
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,480
Oh.

1613
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,060
I wish I could like.

1614
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:12,660
What's the word?

1615
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:13,900
Uh.

1616
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,700
Quick save?

1617
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,060
You know?

1618
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:17,720
Oh, save.

1619
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,480
The save state here or something.

1620
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,740
I forgot to rev.

1621
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:23,760
Miss me?

1622
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,040
It's fine.

1623
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,050
Oh my god.

1624
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:34,970
Oh my god.

1625
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:35,810
Oh my god.

1626
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,180
Oh my god.

1627
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,280
Did I just break my...

1628
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,600
I just...

1629
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:43,700
I just...

1630
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,220
I...

1631
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,260
I...

1632
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:46,500
Did it...

1633
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,200
I forgot that tomboy could turn into a god.

1634
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,620
Oh my god.

1635
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,680
Oh my god.

1636
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,360
I forgot.

1637
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,400
Wait.

1638
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:00,220
I can blow that though.

1639
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:00,600
Oh.

1640
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,220
Nice.

1641
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:01,500
Okay.

1642
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,200
I'm just gonna keep...

1643
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,300
Getting this guy though.

1644
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:09,570
Oh shoot.

1645
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:10,210
Okay.

1646
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,390
Actually, I don't think that got me.

1647
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,430
But that got me!

1648
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,410
Oh my gosh.

1649
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:31,410
Oh my gosh.

1650
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:32,810
I didn't notice the...

1651
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:33,790
Oh man.

1652
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:35,190
This is...

1653
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,330
This is a fight.

1654
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,230
Already.

1655
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,530
I'm feeling it.

1656
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:42,590
Already I'm feeling it.

1657
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:45,130
I've barely made a dent in him.

1658
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,460
Oh my gosh, please.

1659
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:54,960
Oh.

1660
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:55,620
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1661
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,200
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1662
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,390
Okay, run.

1663
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:17,350
Sure.

1664
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:18,510
Maybe it

1665
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,100
was...

1666
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:22,860
Wait.

1667
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,680
No sir.

1668
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:33,330
Wait.

1669
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1670
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:43,250
I...

1671
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:44,600
We dodgero?

1672
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,820
We dodgero?

1673
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,300
Mission 8.

1674
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,000
I didn't see the freaking...

1675
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,420
Are there any...

1676
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,160
Oh shoot, ugh.

1677
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,040
I don't see any health things around.

1678
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,560
Oh my god!

1679
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:02,880
Okay.

1680
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,380
Oh my god, I'm almost there.

1681
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,400
Right away.

1682
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,580
Where's your motivation?

1683
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:15,340
No!

1684
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,500
I totally dove under that!

1685
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,180
Oh my gosh, I dodged that though.

1686
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,060
Oh, that's so lame!

1687
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,060
Where's your motivation?

1688
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,400
Checkpoint.

1689
01:21:59,220 --> 01:21:59,840
Cry.

1690
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,780
Okay, I don't want Tomboy then if...

1691
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:05,720
If...

1692
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,200
If, uh...

1693
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,260
I tried to use the gun.

1694
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:12,380
Cause I...

1695
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:13,840
I forgot about that.

1696
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,880
Grab you.

1697
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,680
Grab some more.

1698
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,840
Wait, is there something up there?

1699
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,520
Let's just notice it.

1700
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,540
Let's see.

1701
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:25,700
Up there.

1702
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:33,670
Maybe not, okay.

1703
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,720
There's a secret, uh...

1704
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,320
I see.

1705
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,260
Holy cow.

1706
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,900
We're only on...

1707
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:51,720
Let me try it.

1708
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,300
Let me try it again.

1709
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,740
I can't believe we're...

1710
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,640
I can't believe we're...

1711
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,420
Only...

1712
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,260
I haven't even beat one mission today.

1713
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,440
I can't...

1714
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:08,600
I can't...

1715
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:08,940
I don't...

1716
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:09,060
I don't...

1717
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,500
I feel like I'm getting...

1718
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:10,880
Gaslit.

1719
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,040
I don't know.

1720
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:21,640
It's fine.

1721
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,160
I don't care.

1722
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,540
Barbara is great for deflecting and Helter Skelter is a good shield breaker.

1723
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,100
Yeah...

1724
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,000
It's...

1725
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,520
It's...

1726
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,600
Not a matter of me forgetting things.

1727
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,840
It's a matter of...

1728
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:37,340
The panic.

1729
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,540
You know?

1730
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,100
Where are you?

1731
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:12,320
Wait.

1732
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:12,720
Oops.

1733
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,680
I did the wrong order.

1734
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:23,340
Stop.

1735
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:23,960
Come here.

1736
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,140
Why don't you come to me?

1737
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,120
Oh.

1738
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:30,600
Wait.

1739
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:31,520
Can you come down?

1740
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:34,920
There we go.

1741
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,980
If it works, it works.

1742
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:38,920
More warps, please.

1743
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:39,400
Thank you.

1744
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:39,780
Okay.

1745
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,210
Saving out money for stuff, at least.

1746
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:50,990
Come here.

1747
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,230
It's fine.

1748
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:56,590
Oh, wait.

1749
01:24:56,730 --> 01:24:57,370
Did I grab the money?

1750
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:57,750
Yeah.

1751
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:58,110
Okay.

1752
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,270
Just farming.

1753
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,010
Okay.

1754
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:03,890
More money.

1755
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,670
More money.

1756
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:09,370
This guy is a doozy.

1757
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:12,310
Oh, I forgot.

1758
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,790
It's fine.

1759
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,190
I forgot to put one away.

1760
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:22,290
Remember, Mintz.

1761
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:22,830
It's not your fault.

1762
01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:24,390
It's Nero for being dead weight.

1763
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,450
I forgot to put one away.

1764
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:27,410
Rev this.

1765
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:27,850
Thank you.

1766
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,050
Let's rev up.

1767
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,810
Nice.

1768
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:31,790
Okay.

1769
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:36,150
Okay.

1770
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:37,530
Hey, douchebag.

1771
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,730
Miss me?

1772
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,470
Oh.

1773
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:41,770
Oh.

1774
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:44,130
This fight is scary.

1775
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:47,270
This...

1776
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,550
Whoa.

1777
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:48,390
Whoa.

1778
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,430
Ouch.

1779
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,590
Josh.

1780
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:01,950
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1781
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,560
Oh my god.

1782
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:07,940
Please.

1783
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:08,800
Get me out of there.

1784
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:16,040
I don't know.

1785
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:16,640
I get...

1786
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,140
I'll try...

1787
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,240
I try to get like a couple hits in, so then I can...

1788
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:25,290
Uh, okay.

1789
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,630
Yeah, I keep doing this, actually.

1790
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,200
Okay.

1791
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:47,490
Okay.

1792
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:47,930
It's working.

1793
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:49,550
Shield of yours.

1794
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:50,710
It's done for.

1795
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:57,570
Oh, I forgot to...

1796
01:26:59,090 --> 01:26:59,810
Oh, no!

1797
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,830
Oh, oh my god.

1798
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:01,410
It worked.

1799
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:02,210
Let's go.

1800
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,690
Wait, is this shield actually?

1801
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:09,970
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1802
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:12,170
No, no, no, ouch, ouch.

1803
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:12,910
Get out of there!

1804
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:13,490
Nero!

1805
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:14,770
Get out, get out, get out.

1806
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,160
Let's get airful!

1807
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:31,500
Nice.

1808
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,720
Nice dodge.

1809
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,660
Oh, what the hell did that...

1810
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:35,220
What was that?

1811
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,600
What the hell was that?

1812
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,200
I've never seen that one.

1813
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:45,600
He did the work.

1814
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,820
What the more?

1815
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:52,860
Please.

1816
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,800
I'm trying.

1817
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:56,520
I'm trying.

1818
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,120
Oh my god.

1819
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,680
I'm not timing these well at all.

1820
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,180
Okay, whatever.

1821
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:20,530
Oh, shoot.

1822
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:21,750
Ah, shoot, shoot, shoot.

1823
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:26,110
Okay, we kind of got saved, I think, by iframes a little bit there.

1824
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:32,310
Oh my god.

1825
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:32,970
Oh my god.

1826
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:34,990
I do.

1827
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:36,190
I do regret it.

1828
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:36,750
I do.

1829
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,190
I regret my existence.

1830
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:39,590
I regret my words and deeds.

1831
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:43,970
Thank you.

1832
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:45,730
Thank you.

1833
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:17,450
Almost broken.

1834
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:19,070
You ready to get slapped?

1835
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,690
You will suffer.

1836
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,570
Oh, I'm too far.

1837
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:32,690
Oh, shoot.

1838
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:33,790
Nice.

1839
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,370
Wait.

1840
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,410
Nice shot.

1841
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,070
I did the wrong order again.

1842
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:49,010
Here we go.

1843
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:49,250
Okay.

1844
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:50,070
All right.

1845
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,610
Run from the lava block.

1846
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:54,910
And go in and...

1847
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:03,010
Nope.

1848
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:04,470
Right now.

1849
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,750
Let's get airport.

1850
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:09,570
Please.

1851
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:12,330
There we go...

1852
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,550
Let's get airport.

1853
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:16,150
Okay, nice.

1854
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,580
Oh, shoot!

1855
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:28,480
No!

1856
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:29,900
I tried!

1857
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:30,040
Myr axied.

1858
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,500
We got out there.

1859
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:35,840
Okay, nice.

1860
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,620
Run, run, run, run, run!

1861
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,760
Run, run, run.

1862
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,400
How much left is on it?

1863
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,360
Oh, just a tiny bit left.

1864
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,260
Just a tiny bit left.

1865
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,960
Let's see what he's gonna do now.

1866
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:47,340
Okay.

1867
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:49,460
Alright I'll wait.

1868
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:51,060
Wait.

1869
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,060
I'll wait.

1870
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:53,840
I'll wait.

1871
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:00,510
Oh my god!

1872
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:00,810
No!

1873
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:01,510
No!

1874
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:01,810
No!

1875
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:02,570
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1876
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:03,710
Wait, DID I get it?

1877
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,400
Wait!

1878
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,300

1879
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,180
Come on!

1880
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:16,380
Wait, Nero!

1881
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,800
Come on, Nero!

1882
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,480
Yeah, we got his hand!

1883
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,540
Nice going!

1884
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:23,800
Yeah!

1885
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,580
Oh my god, wait, look at his tooth!

1886
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,560
He's so cute!

1887
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,500
Oh my god!

1888
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:33,720

1897
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Urine!

1898
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Urine!

1899
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Urine!

1900
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,600
Urine!

1901
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,600

Urine!

1911
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:48,720
Urine!

1912
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:48,720
Urine!

1913
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:48,720

01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,080
Urine!

1923
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:49,440
Urine!

1924
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:49,780
Urine!

1925
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:49,800

1926
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:49,800
Urine!

1927
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,440
Urine!

1928
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:51,540
Urine!

1929
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,040
Urine!

1930
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,040
Urine!

1931

Urine!

1932
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:52,060

01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:52,220
Urine!

1936
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:52,220
Urine!

1937
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Urine!

1938
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Urine!

1939
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Urine!

1940
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Urine!

1941
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Urine!

1942
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:57,580
Urine!

1943
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:57,580
Urine!

1944
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:57,580
Urine!

1945
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:57,580
Urine!

1946
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:57,640
Urine!

1947
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:57,900
Urine!

1948
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:58,200
Urine!

1949
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:58,360
Urine!

1950
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:58,360
Urine!

1951
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:58,360
Urine!

1952
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:58,360
Urine!

1953
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:58,480
Urine!

1954
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:58,720
Urine!

1955
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,020
Urine!

1956
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,020
Urine!

1957
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,020
Urine!

1958
01:31:59,120 --> 01:31:59,120
Urine!

1959
01:31:59,120 --> 01:31:59,120
Urine!

1960
01:31:59,120 --> 01:31:59,120
Urine!

1961
01:31:59,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Urine!

1962
01:31:59,200 --> 01:31:59,420
Urine!

1963
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:01,940
Urine!

1964
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:04,900
Urine!

1965
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:11,980
Urine!

1966
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,040
Urine!

1967
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:15,720
Urine!

1968
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,180
Ur Oh no, no!

1969
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,000
Oh god, okay.

1970
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:29,820
No again?

1971
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,820
No again?

1972
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:39,900
Oh god.

1973
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:44,260
Oh my god.

1974
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:45,260
Oh my god, please.

1975
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,540
I'm trying to run around if there's...

1976
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:49,380
Oh god, this is brutal.

1977
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,600
Wait, this is so brutal.

1978
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:11,410
Wait, what?

1979
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:13,590
Oh my god.

1980
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:16,950
Wait.

1981
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,190
Go back to it.

1982
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,980
This is so evil.

1983
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,080
Ouch, ouch.

1984
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:29,560
Wait.

1985
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:30,940
One HP and a dream.

1986
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,350
Nero, I don't think this is it, buddy.

1987
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,350
Oh, scripted.

1988
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:48,270
I had a feeling.

1989
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:49,370
I was like, there's no way.

1990
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:51,270
Not with any...

1991
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:53,510
Gorbs around, or...

1992
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:54,670
Gorbs around, right?

1993
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:56,730
Forced loss.

1994
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:58,490
I'm here, oh no!

1995
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:07,750
Okay, but I feel like when we fight them again, that's gonna be how it's like.

1996
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,070
So, at least we...

1997
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:11,090
We get an idea.

1998
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:11,810
Maybe.

1999
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:19,360
Duh-duh.

2000
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,760
Who dares interfere?

2001
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:23,180
Oh!

2002
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:24,320
Oh!

2003
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,480
Oh!

2004
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,460
Oh!

2005
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,840
Where have you been?

2006
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,240
Where have you been?

2007
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:37,500
Where have you been?

2008
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:41,240
Where have you been?

2009
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,140
I feel like I'm eating popcorn.

2010
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:00,410
Yeah!

2011
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:10,320
Let's be determined to seek out...

2012
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:14,800
Oh!

2013
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,540
May the...

2014
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:17,500
That was...

2015
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,540
That was yesterday!

2016
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:22,980
You could've at least knocked, Morrison.

2017
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:25,760
Yeah?

2018
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:26,800
I could.

2019
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,590
Literally yesterday, this guy...

2020
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,260
This guy met up with Dante.

2021
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,320
I got some good news and some bad news.

2022
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:35,800
Pick your poison.

2023
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:36,860
Which you wanna hear first?

2024
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,440
Just speak.

2025
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,520
Bad news it is.

2026
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:45,980
Bad news it is.

2027
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,580
Lady Patty's feathers are all ruffled.

2028
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:51,720
See, she wants to invite you to her birthday party.

2029
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,120
But your phone is disconnected.

2030
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,540
Dante's not paying his bills.

2031
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,160
You're a smart one, Morrison.

2032
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,000
You notice the electric and water out too?

2033
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:00,480
What?

2034
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:02,220
Nothing less.

2035
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:05,080
So what's the good news?

2036
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:05,460
Oh!

2037
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:07,620
I got a gig.

2038
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:08,960
Cash up front.

2039
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,060
Cash up front?

2040
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,580
This, I like.

2041
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,600
The water needs turning on, and those toilets need flushing.

2042
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:16,140
Oh!

2043
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:16,840
Oh no!

2044
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,500
You could go somewhere else!

2045
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,360
You don't have to use the to...

2046
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:21,840
Oh!

2047
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,720
We've been a real agency.

2048
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:29,900
Let's see.

2049
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,220
Oh!

2050
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:31,840
That was fast.

2051
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:36,870
That was so fast.

2052
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:38,790
Devil may cry.

2053
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:39,310
Tante!

2054
01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:39,930
Tante!

2055
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:41,970
Do you have any idea how many times I've tried to call?

2056
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:42,850
Like a billion!

2057
01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:44,170
Oh my god!

2058
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:46,910
Tonight's my first 18!

2059
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:47,950
Not a little kid!

2060
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:49,430
Is this the girl from the anime?

2061
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,330
The little girl?

2062
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:54,630
Yeah!

2063
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:55,050
Okay, Morrison.

2064
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:56,650
I'll take you up on that gig.

2065
01:36:56,850 --> 01:36:57,330
Yes!

2066
01:36:57,450 --> 01:36:57,710
Okay!

2067
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,570
If you can get me out of that hellish birthday party.

2068
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:04,750
Huh, consider your RSVP declined.

2069
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:07,190
meet your new client.

2070
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:09,450
Why don't you want to go hang out?

2071
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:12,470
Listen, I'm gonna find a lady and Trish.

2072
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,810
Bring him in on this.

2073
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:15,090
What?

2074
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:15,950
Come on!

2075
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:17,830
You don't think I can handle this gig on my own?

2076
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,130
It's a big job.

2077
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:21,130
Big job, Dante.

2078
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,430
You're gonna need the help.

2079
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:26,950
V looking all mysterious.

2080
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:34,670
He walks in and immediately slinks around the corner and starts reading a book.

2081
01:37:35,610 --> 01:37:37,130
I have no name.

2082
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:40,110
I am but two days old.

2083
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:40,910
He's a baby.

2084
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,800
Just kidding.

2085
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,920
You can call me V.

2086
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,180
Okay, V.

2087
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,360
Why don't you tell me everything about this job?

2088
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:53,500
Lol, JK.

2089
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:59,360
A powerful demon is about to resurrect and we need your help, Dante.

2090
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,020
Who's weak?

2091
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,220
Now that's a familiar tune.

2092
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:08,340
Do you have any idea how many times I've heard that exact same line?

2093
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,940
Just a prank, bro.

2094
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,240
This is... special.

2095
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:13,860
Special?

2096
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:15,340
Okay.

2097
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,380
So what's so special about this one?

2098
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,420
This demon is your reason.

2099
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,080
Oh.

2100
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,260
I love the... Your reason for fighting.

2101
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,420
The lady is just haphazardly pinned to the wall.

2102
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,200
This demon got a name?

2103
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,380
Oh.

2104
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:35,260
Wait?

2105
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:39,640
Why did it look like he was saying Virgil?

2106
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,320
Virgil?

2107
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:43,940
Virgil?

2108
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:44,920
Vir... Why?

2109
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,040
Vir... Virgin?

2110
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:50,340
Wait.

2111
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,620
Oh my God.

2112
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:02,200
Is he asking... Is he asking Dante to take his... his V card?

2113
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,960
Is that why his name is V?

2114
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,400
He...

2115
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:17,570
Mission 9.

2116
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:19,330
Let's see.

2117
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:19,650
Ah.

2118
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:20,010
Wait!

2119
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:22,670
Oh I did get, actually, a good chunk of money there.

2120
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:24,730
But I think I...

2121
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:26,510
Can't... Oh, Wait.

2122
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:27,170
Uh oh.

2123
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:28,150
We're back to V.

2124
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:30,350
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2125
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:31,570
Oh, Now-ho-ho-do.

2126
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:32,470
Okay.

2127
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,230
Uh uh I see, I see.

2128
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:35,190
Uh.

2129
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:35,750
Now-ho-ho-do.

2130
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,210
Okay.

2131
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:36,290
Okay.

2132
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:39,550
Oh gosh, I have to remember how to play as this guy again.

2133
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:45,550
Once his card is taken, he will have no name.

2134
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:46,710
Hence the poem.

2135
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:57,690
Green Gainer.

2136
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:02,590
He's still named V so that didn't turn out well.

2137
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:04,890
Freak Phantom Streaks again.

2138
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:07,390
Deepest Lore.

2139
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,130
Oh gosh.

2140
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:12,570
That's why the cane is called the Royal Fork.

2141
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:19,570
I think I know his MO now.

2142
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:24,470
I think I'm understanding what V is all about.

2143
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,420
I think I'm beginning to understand.

2144
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:33,120
Let's see.

2145
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:33,880
Blockade.

2146
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:36,360
Okay.

2147
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,980
This is the bird.

2148
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,420
This is the cat.

2149
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,240
What's the bird?

2150
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,920
Griffin and Shadow, right?

2151
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:44,740
Oh wait.

2152
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,260
Oh yes, there.

2153
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:45,720
Shadow.

2154
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,680
I was like, wait, these are all the bird's moves.

2155
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:49,380
Um, okay.

2156
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:52,480
I'll be honest.

2157
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,980
I just... Here, let me show you guys what I do.

2158
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,640
Since you guys can see my controller.

2159
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,400
In the void.

2160
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,380
Let me show you what all I do.

2161
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,620
When I play as V, okay?

2162
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,920
Are you guys ready for this really great gameplay?

2163
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:05,520
Here we go.

2164
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:23,860
Oh

2165
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,160
okay.

2166
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:28,480
I think I'm really good.

2167
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,300
Can you even lock on?

2168
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:29,560
Okay.

2169
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:30,320
Let's lock on.

2170
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,060
Oh God.

2171
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,790
And it's peak.

2172
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,370
I think this is lore accurate.

2173
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,090
Okay, good.

2174
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,530
Whee!

2175
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,550
Is there even more to it?

2176
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:54,350
Apparently, because you can do combos, but...

2177
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:57,010
Oh my gosh, Dr. Bon!

2178
01:41:57,330 --> 01:41:58,170
Happy birthday!

2179
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:00,270
Happy, happy birthday!

2180
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:02,470
You're supposed to taunt, too.

2181
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:03,190
Oh yeah, that's right.

2182
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:07,470
And I... oh wait, how do I read my book?

2183
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,570
I take out... it's RT, right?

2184
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:10,270
I have to keep going.

2185
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:10,810
RT.

2186
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:12,410
Take out your book.

2187
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,370
Take out your book.

2188
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:17,570
To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wildflower.

2189
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:22,010
All infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour.

2190
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:30,260
Oh.

2191
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:31,260
Why'd you stop reading?

2192
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:33,580
Why'd you stop...

2193
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,980
And then we summon our guy!

2194
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,100
Yeah!

2195
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,400
We're optionizing.

2196
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:53,780
Okay.

2197
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,780
Oh my god.

2198
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:59,720
Alright, I think... I think I remember how to play... a little bit.

2199
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,560
Like when I play cookie cooker.

2200
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,220
This is the gameplay.

2201
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:09,180
Okay.

2202
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:15,480
I mean, I could do more combos, but will I even use them?

2203
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,220
Oh, I guess that we can do this.

2204
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:19,760
Yeah, yeah.

2205
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,960
That's our... okay.

2206
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:21,720
A nightmare!

2207
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:24,860
During promotion.

2208
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,260
We don't have promotion.

2209
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:29,840
I could get it.

2210
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,160
But I... I don't know.

2211
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:34,040
Today is also my birthday!

2212
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,780
Yeah, I know it's Murphy's, too.

2213
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:37,380
I said happy birthday to Murphy earlier.

2214
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,220
Hi, it's me.

2215
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,160
Happy birthday!

2216
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:40,880
Happy, happy birthday!

2217
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:43,660
Happy, happy birthday.

2218
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,400
Don't need it?

2219
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:50,780
Okay.

2220
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:52,340
Let's just... let's just go in then.

2221
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:56,340
Let's go in, baby.

2222
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:57,920
Mission started!

2223
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,030
Back to June.

2224
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:06,270
June 15th.

2225
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:08,910
You have so many birthdays today, huh?

2226
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:14,690
May the Force be with you.

2227
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:16,210
Eww!

2228
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:16,990
What the hell?

2229
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:18,830
Shoo!

2230
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:23,790
Did you find it?

2231
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:26,310
Oh, well, I don't know what I found, but...

2232
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:28,610
I think I saw some demons dancing.

2233
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:31,410
Well, then I guess we keep going.

2234
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:34,230
The Devil Sword Sparta is nearby.

2235
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:38,610
Oh, yeah!

2236
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:39,150
Look at them!

2237
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,010
I can... yep, they're dancing alright.

2238
01:44:44,490 --> 01:44:45,790
Can I still see them dancing?

2239
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:50,550
Okay.

2240
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:52,330
We got two ways we can go.

2241
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:55,230
Obviously, the other way is probably the way we need to go, but...

2242
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,930
What the?

2243
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:57,490
Really?

2244
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,070
What am I getting ambushed?

2245
01:44:59,370 --> 01:44:59,930
Oh, no.

2246
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:01,170
I'm not getting ambushed.

2247
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:01,690
Am I?

2248
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:05,070
That's just because I started riding that guy?

2249
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:05,330
Okay.

2250
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:06,230
I forgot that I...

2251
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:07,590
I forgot that I knew how to skateboard.

2252
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:13,110
Sick'em, boy!

2253
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:15,150
Take

2254
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,080
out my books.

2255
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:43,190
Oh, yeah, that's right!

2256
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:44,510
Uh, wait, how do I...

2257
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:45,790
Uh, then I do this, right?

2258
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:46,670
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2259
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,830
That's right, I forgot about this part.

2260
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:52,850
Oh, no!

2261
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,240
Oh, yeah.

2262
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:00,700
I forgot about the...

2263
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,520
That they can't finish them for some reason.

2264
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,140
What useless animals.

2265
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:10,850
Is this...

2266
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:12,010
Is this...

2267
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,910
Nope, that's a flower.

2268
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:17,630
heheheh...

2269
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:19,050
Yeah, we gotta...

2270
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:19,870
Braababam.

2271
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:21,290
Braabababam.

2272
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:21,710
Braababam.

2273
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:27,210
Bears can't kill.

2274
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,300
Oh, yeah.

2275
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:33,820
Just let that guy do his thing!

2276
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,380
Heheheheh...

2277
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:37,780
Oh, yeah!

2278
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:39,440
Oh, oh, no.

2279
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,960
Now he's doing his thing on me.

2280
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:41,740
Oh, no.

2281
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:42,340
Wait.

2282
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:43,260
Don't let him do his thing.

2283
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:44,380
Uh oh.

2284
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:47,340
Behemoth!

2285
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:48,320
Oh my god!

2286
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,380
Oh no.

2287
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:50,920
I don't like that.

2288
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:07,010
And I think he's doing it over there.

2289
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:09,490
This is so funny.

2290
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:16,530
Oh my god.

2291
01:47:16,690 --> 01:47:16,910
Wait!

2292
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:17,790
Wait, they're coming close!

2293
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:19,590
Stay in the graveyard!

2294
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,050
Oh no, don't stay in the graveyard!

2295
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:26,830
Yeah, take him down!

2296
01:47:29,730 --> 01:47:30,110
Hound?

2297
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:31,350
Don't take me down.

2298
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:32,190
Don't touch...oh wait.

2299
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:33,090
Uh, I see you.

2300
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:46,940
Can I read...oh!

2301
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,420
Uh, can I...wait.

2302
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:51,820
Oh yeah!

2303
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,640
That was fast.

2304
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,420
Wait, what am I doing?

2305
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,240
That was it?

2306
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,140
What a pitiful sight.

2307
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,760
I could steer him.

2308
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:08,380
That's so funny.

2309
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,080
Nyah, nyah, nyah.

2310
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,820
Nyah, nyah, nyah.

2311
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:17,380
Wait.

2312
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:17,760
No.

2313
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:18,160
Stop.

2314
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:18,960
Grab the warbs.

2315
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:19,940
Before they disappear.

2316
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:22,540
More important than anything else.

2317
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,120
Alright.

2318
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:25,680
Onwards!

2319
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,540
Oh, come on!

2320
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,380
I tried to do a trick through the hall!

2321
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,080
I wanted to do a sick trick.

2322
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:36,080
The game denied me.

2323
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,540
My purpose.

2324
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:43,560
Tony Hawk noises.

2325
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,940
Nyah, nyah, nyah.

2326
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:50,880
To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower.

2327
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:55,340
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour.

2328
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:57,480
Nice.

2329
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:00,380
Keep breathing.

2330
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,160
Keep...okay, never mind.

2331
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:05,620
Oh, oh.

2332
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:08,980
Oh.

2333
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:12,320
Maybe, like, actually get over to the thing, then.

2334
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:12,800
You know?

2335
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:16,080
Oh sh...oh, my god!

2336
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,360
My animals!

2337
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,580
Come on, animals!

2338
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,220
Uh-oh.

2339
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,200
My bird died.

2340
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,620
Um...my bird died.

2341
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:25,440
Hey,

2342
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:30,840
come back to life, bird.

2343
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:34,340
Slice him.

2344
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:35,580
Yeah, slice him.

2345
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:35,980
There we go.

2346
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,060
Oh, bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.

2347
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,000
Oh, there we go.

2348
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:42,780
Take him out.

2349
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,150
Oh, oh, oh, that's me.

2350
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:53,730
That's me.

2351
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:54,190
Oh!

2352
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:56,650
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2353
01:49:59,110 --> 01:49:59,430
Team!

2354
01:49:59,430 --> 01:49:59,750
Team!

2355
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:00,630
Team!

2356
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:07,460
Don't let him get close to me.

2357
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:09,860
There we go.

2358
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:10,420
Come on.

2359
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:11,500
Do your job.

2360
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:12,200
Oh.

2361
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,440
He's close.

2362
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:14,460
Or no, he's there.

2363
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,140
I got him.

2364
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,520
And we got this guy too.

2365
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:23,700
Gosh.

2366
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:29,390
Lock-on helps.

2367
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,990
Oh, is this...what is this?

2368
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:36,010
Oh, oh, grab it!

2369
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:36,970
Um...

2370
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:38,510
Grab it.

2371
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:39,790
Wait, how do we get that?

2372
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:41,550
How do we get this?

2373
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:43,510
Uh...let's see.

2374
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:46,290
Hold on.

2375
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:49,370
Uh...

2376
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:50,510
Do I...

2377
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:55,270
Alright, you can come back now.

2378
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:56,430
You can come back now.

2379
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:57,550
You can come back now.

2380
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:58,610
You can come back now.

2381
01:50:58,890 --> 01:50:58,990
You can come back now.

2382
01:51:01,790 --> 01:51:03,770
We got a gorb!

2383
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:05,590
Cool entrance.

2384
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:07,070
Yeah, baby.

2385
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,370
Now I imagine...

2386
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:14,150
This is not the way we have to go.

2387
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,730
But there's some special stuff here.

2388
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:16,730
Oh.

2389
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:21,870
Pin him to the wall.

2390
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:23,270
You should go over there.

2391
01:51:23,570 --> 01:51:24,610
Go over there.

2392
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:26,890
Go over there and do the thing.

2393
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:29,410
Oh my god.

2394
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:30,650
Oh my god.

2395
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:32,010
Wait, this area is kind of really scary.

2396
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:33,430
Oh my god.

2397
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,620
Yeah, get that guy!

2398
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,980
Yeah, get that guy!

2399
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,360
Yeah, attack!

2400
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:58,760
Attack!

2401
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,640
Get him!

2402
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:07,140
Get him!

2403
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:07,360
Get him!

2404
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:10,450
Get him!

2405
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:10,930
That was close.

2406
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,520
Oh my gosh.

2407
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:24,800
Ouch.

2408
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,600
Pin to the wall.

2409
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:33,970
Oh my god!

2410
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:35,130
I'm in trouble.

2411
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:37,610
Wait, I'm in trouble.

2412
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:42,850
My pets are dead.

2413
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:43,990
Everybody's dead.

2414
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:45,090
Everybody's dead.

2415
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:47,710
Life is not good.

2416
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,220
Playing against V is so hard with some of these enemies!

2417
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:56,540
Oh my gosh.

2418
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:00,260
Playing against V is so hard for some of these enemies!

2419
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:01,540
I fear!

2420
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:03,320
Oh wait.

2421
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:03,820
That guy.

2422
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:08,800
Okay, there we got him.

2423
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:12,490
Ouch!

2424
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:14,830
Stupid ass.

2425
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:27,880
Please.

2426
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:28,700
Please.

2427
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:29,280
Please.

2428
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:31,100
Yeah.

2429
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,620
Please just kill them.

2430
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,200
Please just kill them.

2431
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:36,920
What's not good?

2432
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:37,640
Oh, yeah.

2433
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:38,420
You're right.

2434
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:39,180
This isn't.

2435
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:43,580
Oh my gosh.

2436
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:50,480
At least when I do that, it seems my guys come back to life.

2437
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:51,440
Which is pretty nice.

2438
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:54,280
It's

2439
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:12,790
probably so close.

2440
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,010
Oh my god.

2441
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:14,310
Again?

2442
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:15,730
Uh oh.

2443
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:16,710
Now we're really in trouble.

2444
01:54:20,110 --> 01:54:21,390
Everybody, please wake up.

2445
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:22,790
Please wake up.

2446
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:24,030
Please wake up!

2447
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:25,450
Please wake up.

2448
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:26,490
Please wake up.

2449
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,650
Please wake up.

2450
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:29,050
Please wake up!

2451
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:33,210
Oh my god.

2452
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:35,350
Wake up.

2453
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:35,750
There we go.

2454
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:41,900
Okay.

2455
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:44,340
We're just now getting back into...

2456
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,840
Into fighting with V.

2457
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:46,680
So...

2458
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,640
Might take a second.

2459
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,320
But holy...

2460
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:50,880
Holy cannoli.

2461
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:56,320
The angel that presided on my birth.

2462
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:59,040
Said little creature formed of joy and mirth.

2463
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:01,640
Go love without the help of anything on earth.

2464
01:55:05,070 --> 01:55:06,850
You can parry attacks with your cane?

2465
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:07,610
Oh, I can?

2466
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:08,330
Okay.

2467
01:55:08,530 --> 01:55:08,930
Good to know.

2468
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:10,850
Keep reading.

2469
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:12,690
To see a world in a grain of sand.

2470
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:14,410
And a heaven in a wild flower.

2471
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:16,910
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand.

2472
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:17,430
And eternity in a power.

2473
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:17,550
Oh wait.

2474
01:55:17,650 --> 01:55:19,810
Reading doesn't do anything except in battle, right?

2475
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:20,270
That's right.

2476
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:20,590
I forgot.

2477
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:24,390
Reading doesn't do anything unless you're in battle.

2478
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:26,870
I forgore.

2479
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:28,810
Yes.

2480
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:30,430
But I right now...

2481
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:31,350
I remember.

2482
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:31,970
I need you.

2483
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:32,390
Oh.

2484
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:37,710
Okay.

2485
01:55:39,370 --> 01:55:40,730
Don't fall down there just yet.

2486
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:42,270
Okay, hold on.

2487
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,530
Let's go back.

2488
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:46,350
Unless we get...

2489
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,010
Unless this...

2490
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:47,190
Wait.

2491
01:55:47,630 --> 01:55:47,810
Oh.

2492
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:49,210
Hello.

2493
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:50,990
Fragment?

2494
01:55:51,530 --> 01:55:53,190
We came from over here.

2495
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:55,250
There was some roars.

2496
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:56,730
Oh, this area is kind of big.

2497
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,170
Okay.

2498
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,780
If I taunt, will I get more?

2499
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:06,280
Only in battle.

2500
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:07,060
Okay, nevermind.

2501
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:09,660
Need DT.

2502
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:10,780
Yeah, I know.

2503
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:11,720
I know.

2504
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:12,620
You're telling me.

2505
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,900
How does it feel?

2506
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,480
Maybe it's one big circle.

2507
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:25,040
I'm not sure.

2508
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:34,940
Please.

2509
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,340
Maybe we can get something easy.

2510
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2511
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,180
And then I can...

2512
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:39,720
While I read and hear.

2513
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:40,080
Okay.

2514
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:43,960
There we go.

2515
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,780
There we go.

2516
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:46,800
There we go.

2517
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:46,820
There we go.

2518
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,080
This is exactly what we needed.

2519
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:50,760
Oh, yeah.

2520
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:51,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2521
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:01,220
Nice.

2522
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:05,300
Shadow, I need you to like go up here.

2523
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,780
And then I read some more.

2524
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:08,100
Oh.

2525
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,400
I guess I don't need to actually.

2526
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:15,130
Oh no.

2527
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:15,910
Did they disappear?

2528
01:57:21,670 --> 01:57:23,730
I don't think I got it fast enough.

2529
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:24,230
It's fine.

2530
01:57:26,910 --> 01:57:27,690
All right.

2531
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,210
But we got full DT.

2532
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:31,510
So that's...

2533
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:32,890
That's really good to have.

2534
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:35,590
Oh, another guy.

2535
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:38,270
Oh, another guy.

2536
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:38,610
Oh, more guys.

2537
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:41,130
Oh no.

2538
01:57:41,350 --> 01:57:41,930
These guys.

2539
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:45,250
In fact, let's just...

2540
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,730
Did he just...

2541
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:51,970
Did he just belly flop his way in?

2542
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:01,550
He sure is trying.

2543
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:02,650
I'm trying too.

2544
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:05,070
That's definitely a thing that I'm doing.

2545
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:05,930
Wait.

2546
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:06,690
This guy.

2547
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,860
It's definitely a thing that I'm doing is trying.

2548
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:14,960
There is an attempt happening here.

2549
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:19,990
Oh.

2550
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,180
All that DT we had.

2551
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,160
Go in.

2552
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:38,340
All that DT we had.

2553
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,080
Go in.

2554
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:42,300
It's okay.

2555
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:42,840
We'll get more.

2556
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,400
Hooray for attempts.

2557
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:53,780
Yes.

2558
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:54,640
I like this area.

2559
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,340
It's very pretty.

2560
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,380
I like the flowers.

2561
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:58,840
Oh.

2562
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,300
Oh, shoot.

2563
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:02,640
I'm not good at these ones.

2564
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:05,620
Oh.

2565
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,380
Wait.

2566
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:09,960
What's going on in here?

2567
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:10,460
Wait.

2568
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:11,440
Is this where the...

2569
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:12,100
No.

2570
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:13,440
That's not where the blurb is.

2571
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:20,900
Oh.

2572
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:31,680
I keep forgetting that I can hit with my own heart.

2573
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:32,460
With my own hand.

2574
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:32,880
Wait.

2575
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:33,940
Where actually am I?

2576
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:34,520
I don't know.

2577
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,420
Actually, I'm lost.

2578
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:39,620
Actually...

2579
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:43,500
I don't know where I am at all.

2580
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:50,140
Can I get back up there?

2581
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:51,580
Maybe like this.

2582
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:55,660
Oh, no.

2583
01:59:56,300 --> 01:59:57,060
But I'm lost.

2584
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:58,240
I don't even know where I am.

2585
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,260
Okay.

2586
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,220
I know I have a lost button.

2587
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:07,060
But I don't wanna...

2588
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:07,460
I'm not...

2589
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:08,140
That's not what I mean.

2590
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:11,960
I'm trying to figure out how to get back to where we were.

2591
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,440
I'm so lost.

2592
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:24,600
Wait.

2593
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:25,560
We were here.

2594
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:26,680
Okay.

2595
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:27,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2596
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:28,400
We were here.

2597
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:29,960
And then we...

2598
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:38,510
Okay.

2599
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:40,050
And then we broke down...

2600
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:41,030
That...

2601
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:41,710
This wall.

2602
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:43,750
But...

2603
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:44,470
Uh...

2604
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:46,450
We wouldn't...

2605
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:46,630
Wait.

2606
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:47,790
So I did go in through here.

2607
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:48,170
Wait.

2608
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:49,490
Oh, yes.

2609
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:49,670
Yes.

2610
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:50,050
Here we go.

2611
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:50,330
Okay.

2612
02:00:52,350 --> 02:00:53,470
And I went through here.

2613
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:54,810
And I went through here.

2614
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:55,670
And I went through here.

2615
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:56,190
Okay.

2616
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:56,870
And through...

2617
02:00:57,410 --> 02:00:58,910
Oh, I missed one up there even.

2618
02:00:59,670 --> 02:01:00,750
That I did not notice.

2619
02:01:03,870 --> 02:01:04,590
We're farming.

2620
02:01:04,810 --> 02:01:05,290
We're farming.

2621
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:06,530
We're farming.

2622
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:07,230
We're little farmers.

2623
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:09,810
Oh, God.

2624
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:10,150
Okay.

2625
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,750
Wait.

2626
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:11,570
Is this an easy one?

2627
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:12,210
Okay.

2628
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:12,530
Okay.

2629
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:13,710
This is just one that I can break.

2630
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:14,570
Okay.

2631
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:15,030
Nevermind.

2632
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:16,030
Nevermind.

2633
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:16,370
Okay.

2634
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:18,990
Come on, bird.

2635
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:20,150
Where are you?

2636
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:24,570
Okay.

2637
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,030
And then we go up...

2638
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:29,510
And I...

2639
02:01:29,510 --> 02:01:30,250
Oh, he won!

2640
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:33,710
Okay.

2641
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,290
All right.

2642
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:35,050
Let's do that again.

2643
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:39,010
Drop me!

2644
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,580
Once again, my depth perception...

2645
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:46,840
Uh...

2646
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:48,340
Is the true enemy.

2647
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:49,860
Is the true boss.

2648
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:54,500
Once again, my depth perception...

2649
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:55,360
Uh...

2650
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:56,500
Ends up becoming...

2651
02:01:59,300 --> 02:01:59,820
The...

2652
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:01,520
The most difficult part...

2653
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,700
Of the...

2654
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:03,960
Of the game.

2655
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:06,420
I don't have to get it, but I want it.

2656
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:10,560
Okay.

2657
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:12,180
All right.

2658
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,140
But this is...

2659
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:13,920
This is...

2660
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,180
But it's also good training for me to...

2661
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:17,080
To...

2662
02:02:17,860 --> 02:02:18,760
Do those.

2663
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:19,620
Because...

2664
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:20,980
Those kinds of trees...

2665
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:22,540
I'm not good at those ones.

2666
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:24,680
Come on, bird.

2667
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:27,550
Take me up.

2668
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:27,950
Okay.

2669
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:28,410
Nevermind.

2670
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:35,740
All right.

2671
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:36,700
No, no, no, no, no.

2672
02:02:36,820 --> 02:02:37,260
No, stop.

2673
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:37,540
Stop.

2674
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:37,800
Stop.

2675
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:38,300
Stop.

2676
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:39,060
Okay.

2677
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:39,580
Okay.

2678
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,420
All right.

2679
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:41,320
Okay.

2680
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:46,660
In honor of 5-4, the depth perception strikes back.

2681
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:48,520
Oh, yes.

2682
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:49,180
Oh, oh.

2683
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:50,180
You mean May the 4th.

2684
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,660
Yes, yes.

2685
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:52,180
Okay.

2686
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:52,240
Okay.

2687
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:04,550
I give up.

2688
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:07,010
I give up!

2689
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:07,930
I give up!

2690
02:03:16,450 --> 02:03:17,310
Oh, wait.

2691
02:03:17,530 --> 02:03:17,930
Not...

2692
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:18,590
No, um...

2693
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:19,210
Where was that blur?

2694
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:21,490
Here.

2695
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:24,010
How do I get to you?

2696
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:32,220
How do I get to you?

2697
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,240
Maybe I have to...

2698
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,160
I think I need the DT maybe.

2699
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,180
I think there's a warp in that room.

2700
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:41,840
What room?

2701
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,400
Need the DT, yeah.

2702
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:49,440
Aw, man.

2703
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,220
Wait, can I come back up, though?

2704
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:02,180
It doesn't look...

2705
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,300
It doesn't look promising.

2706
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:04,900
Wait a second.

2707
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:05,800
There's some stairs.

2708
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,380
Wait a second.

2709
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:08,460
I might be able to come back up.

2710
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:10,520
Oh, I th...

2711
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:11,080
I th...

2712
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:11,900
I think...

2713
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:13,320
Maybe...

2714
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:15,900
Uh...

2715
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:18,400
Maybe...

2716
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:19,840
Uh...

2717
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:21,200
Maybe...

2718
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:25,360
Uh...

2719
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,300
Maybe not.

2720
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:31,700
There's no other way to get DT than in battle?

2721
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,260
There's no other way?

2722
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:44,910
Back to where you were gliding to the left.

2723
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:45,830
Huh?

2724
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:48,530
Sorry, I was gliding in a lot of places.

2725
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:49,190
I don't know.

2726
02:05:00,650 --> 02:05:01,990
I don't have any items.

2727
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:02,470
I don't know.

2728
02:05:03,370 --> 02:05:05,030
Oh, there are no items in this game.

2729
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:12,950
I'll go look and see if there's a warp.

2730
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:14,470
Maybe.

2731
02:05:15,610 --> 02:05:18,390
Rack up a total of 16 minutes in the air by jumping.

2732
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:19,310
No way!

2733
02:05:21,710 --> 02:05:22,710
I'm a jumper.

2734
02:05:29,190 --> 02:05:31,030
That's such a random achievement.

2735
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:34,450
One hour of air time.

2736
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:37,970
I don't want to just keep running around in circles here, though.

2737
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:39,270
I want to actually progress.

2738
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:41,510
I want to keep going, but...

2739
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:43,830
I'll do one more look around.

2740
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:48,730
If there was a warp in this area?

2741
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,640
I see none.

2742
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:05,220
I see none.

2743
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:05,300
I see none.

2744
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,440
I see none.

2745
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:22,640
I see none.

2746
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:23,960
Am I getting one guy to you guys?

2747
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,420
Let's see.

2748
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,780
Is it behind this house?

2749
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:37,400
No?

2750
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:52,570
It's fine.

2751
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:53,710
It's fine.

2752
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:55,730
I feel like I'm just wasting time.

2753
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:03,040
I could try one more time, though.

2754
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:05,060
Reload checkpoint.

2755
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:06,400
No, it's not that important.

2756
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:09,420
It's not that important.

2757
02:07:12,110 --> 02:07:12,550
Okay.

2758
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:13,910
But I'm going to try this.

2759
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:14,970
Oh, there goes Shadow.

2760
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:15,590
Good.

2761
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:18,530
And there he goes again.

2762
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:29,640
Oh, I held on for longer than usual.

2763
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:30,220
Okay.

2764
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,000
All right.

2765
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,560
Even if I don't get...

2766
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:33,040
Okay.

2767
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:33,720
Okay.

2768
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:35,020
Okay.

2769
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,560
Spam!

2770
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:37,000
Spam!

2771
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:37,460
Spam!

2772
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:37,900
Spam!

2773
02:07:38,220 --> 02:07:38,740
Spam!

2774
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:39,180
Spam!

2775
02:07:55,410 --> 02:07:56,470
We did it.

2776
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:57,070
Let's go.

2777
02:07:57,730 --> 02:07:59,710
Well, at least we got that out of it, huh?

2778
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:04,350
At least we got the Rorbs out of it.

2779
02:08:06,670 --> 02:08:08,190
Goodbye, Blorb Fragment.

2780
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:09,490
Such a tease.

2781
02:08:10,450 --> 02:08:12,330
But how was I supposed to know that?

2782
02:08:12,590 --> 02:08:13,770
I needed to use...

2783
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:14,270
Keep my...

2784
02:08:14,270 --> 02:08:14,390
Wait.

2785
02:08:15,010 --> 02:08:16,730
Keep my DT, you know?

2786
02:08:19,670 --> 02:08:23,010
I saw someone say that I waste my DT in battle.

2787
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:24,710
But it's not a waste if I'm using it.

2788
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:27,210
If I didn't use it, people would get upset.

2789
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:30,330
If I do use it, people get upset.

2790
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:31,810
There's no winning.

2791
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,400
Also, V is such like a...

2792
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,220
A weird playstyle that...

2793
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:48,200
I prefer to use it, you know?

2794
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:48,940
You said I wasn't.

2795
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,580
I prefer to have nightmare to take care of it.

2796
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,400
The palace is...

2797
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,520
A bitter place for me.

2798
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:54,420
Oh.

2799
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:56,900
You okay?

2800
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:57,820
You okay, buddy?

2801
02:08:58,100 --> 02:08:58,200
Oh.

2802
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:03,720
Oh, there's one there?

2803
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:04,960
He can't reach me though.

2804
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:06,280
Maybe.

2805
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:08,380
Yeah, he can't reach me.

2806
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:11,680
Yeah, he can't reach me.

2807
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:11,800
Oh.

2808
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:14,140
Oh, now you give me a...

2809
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:15,880
Now you give me some...

2810
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:17,640
So rude!

2811
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:30,530
Is there anything down there?

2812
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:31,770
Besides water?

2813
02:09:32,130 --> 02:09:32,310
No.

2814
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,100
Little bitty warp.

2815
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:39,420
Little bitty warp.

2816
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:41,040
I thought I saw something over here.

2817
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:43,200
My eyes deceived me.

2818
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:46,680
Oh, this way.

2819
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:56,620
Is feeling very dark souls all of a sudden.

2820
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:02,420
Is feeling very dark souls all of a sudden.

2821
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:09,880
Oh.

2822
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:09,940
Oh.

2823
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:11,260
Eh, I can read.

2824
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:13,040
Ouch!

2825
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:26,980
Oh my god!

2826
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:27,580
My bird!

2827
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,530
This is why I like to summon my guy.

2828
02:10:45,890 --> 02:10:46,650
Because otherwise...

2829
02:10:47,130 --> 02:10:47,970
I'm in trouble.

2830
02:10:48,590 --> 02:10:48,690
Wait.

2831
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:48,930
Oh.

2832
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:49,190
There.

2833
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:56,800
Yeah.

2834
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:02,710
Let's get out of here.

2835
02:11:08,050 --> 02:11:08,670
There he is.

2836
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:11,290
So nice of you.

2837
02:11:11,470 --> 02:11:12,630
So kind of you to...

2838
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:13,030
Wait for me.

2839
02:11:23,010 --> 02:11:23,230
Okay.

2840
02:11:23,770 --> 02:11:24,050
Ha.

2841
02:11:24,890 --> 02:11:25,770
Golly.

2842
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:28,790
See like this wall looks suspicious.

2843
02:11:29,850 --> 02:11:31,190
Can I break that?

2844
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:33,810
This is suspicious?

2845
02:11:34,530 --> 02:11:35,050
Wait.

2846
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:38,830
It almost looks like the other side.

2847
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:40,730
Of where the blurb was.

2848
02:11:42,130 --> 02:11:44,010
Cause it has the...

2849
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:46,130
It has the...

2850
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:48,530
Eraticate the wall.

2851
02:11:51,290 --> 02:11:51,910
Oh.

2852
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:52,530
No.

2853
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:53,890
That's not...

2854
02:11:53,890 --> 02:11:54,190
Okay.

2855
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:54,590
Come back.

2856
02:11:55,110 --> 02:11:55,750
Go away.

2857
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:56,530
Come on.

2858
02:11:56,590 --> 02:11:56,990
Go to sleep.

2859
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:57,650
Go to sleep!

2860
02:11:59,950 --> 02:12:00,570
Okay.

2861
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:03,400
Just kidding.

2862
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,640
I got a bad feeling about this place.

2863
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:13,280
Turn around.

2864
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,120
Uh.

2865
02:12:20,330 --> 02:12:21,410
What's that sound?

2866
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:23,430
Or those...

2867
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:23,670
Those...

2868
02:12:23,670 --> 02:12:24,750
Those guys that were dancing?

2869
02:12:28,130 --> 02:12:28,770
Hmm.

2870
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:29,470
Cat.

2871
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:30,090
Welcome to membership.

2872
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:30,770
Thank you.

2873
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:32,150
There are barrels.

2874
02:12:35,110 --> 02:12:36,770
I guess I have...

2875
02:12:36,770 --> 02:12:36,970
Wait.

2876
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:37,790
But...

2877
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:38,190
Wait.

2878
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:38,830
Do you guys...

2879
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:38,970
Wait.

2880
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:40,210
Where do I get this then?

2881
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:41,850
How...

2882
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:42,610
Or how...

2883
02:12:42,610 --> 02:12:42,810
Wait.

2884
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:43,950
Can I...

2885
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:45,670
I can't jump around it.

2886
02:12:47,370 --> 02:12:48,610
How do I get this?

2887
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,440
Oh, it's at the exit.

2888
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:57,020
Oh, okay.

2889
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:58,060
It's after the drop.

2890
02:12:58,220 --> 02:12:58,600
Oh, okay.

2891
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:58,760
Okay.

2892
02:12:58,820 --> 02:12:59,300
Thank you guys.

2893
02:13:12,210 --> 02:13:13,310
I ignore you.

2894
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:14,850
I ignore you.

2895
02:13:15,290 --> 02:13:15,870
I ignore you.

2896
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:16,290
I ignore you.

2897
02:13:16,890 --> 02:13:17,170
I hate you.

2898
02:13:17,170 --> 02:13:17,230
Woo!

2899
02:13:17,430 --> 02:13:18,310
You, you, you, you, you.

2900
02:13:20,150 --> 02:13:20,630
Wait.

2901
02:13:20,890 --> 02:13:21,390
Not you.

2902
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:21,650
Oh.

2903
02:13:22,010 --> 02:13:23,310
Can I...

2904
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:25,010
Yeah.

2905
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:27,490
Don't touch me.

2906
02:13:27,770 --> 02:13:28,610
Don't touch me.

2907
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,980
I think we can get this guy too.

2908
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:38,320
Woo!

2909
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:38,420
Oh!

2910
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:40,880
Rude!

2911
02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:46,260
Phil, thank you so much for the 10 gift, dude!

2912
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:48,160
Warb.

2913
02:13:54,940 --> 02:13:56,400
I'm not lost.

2914
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:59,000
It's called exploring, Griffin.

2915
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:04,740
Oh, gosh.

2916
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:05,280
Okay.

2917
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:06,520
Oh.

2918
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:07,920
We can fall here.

2919
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:09,920
Wait.

2920
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:10,580
Oh.

2921
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:13,040
Okay.

2922
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:13,920
And another.

2923
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:14,840
Nice.

2924
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:16,940
I think that's...

2925
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:17,180
Oh!

2926
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:17,620
Oh!

2927
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:18,680
I see it!

2928
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:19,440
I see it!

2929
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:20,020
I see it!

2930
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:22,100
Wait.

2931
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:22,540
Oh.

2932
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:23,660
Oh yeah.

2933
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:25,680
Okay.

2934
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:25,980
Okay.

2935
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:26,440
Wait.

2936
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:27,980
Can he pick me up?

2937
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:29,700
Pick me up, Griffin.

2938
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:32,140
No!

2939
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:41,310
How do I...

2940
02:14:41,310 --> 02:14:42,530
Give me...

2941
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:45,210
Give me...

2942
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:46,110
Lift me up.

2943
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:47,470
I'm not that heavy.

2944
02:14:51,350 --> 02:14:53,250
How do I get high enough, though?

2945
02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:55,470
Oh my gosh.

2946
02:14:59,770 --> 02:15:01,910
Just move as soon as you double jump.

2947
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:03,050
Okay.

2948
02:15:05,090 --> 02:15:05,690
Oh!

2949
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:06,450
Oh!

2950
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:07,590
Oh!

2951
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:08,450
Thank you.

2952
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:10,130
Yeah!

2953
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:12,510
How many do I have?

2954
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:15,270
Um...

2955
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:17,210
I don't know.

2956
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:18,050
I don't know.

2957
02:15:19,970 --> 02:15:21,630
It's like a nice little surprise.

2958
02:15:21,950 --> 02:15:23,190
We never know how many we have.

2959
02:15:23,450 --> 02:15:23,700
And then...

2960
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:24,990
Then...

2961
02:15:24,990 --> 02:15:25,110
Whoop!

2962
02:15:26,430 --> 02:15:26,990
You just...

2963
02:15:26,990 --> 02:15:28,170
You just suddenly have enough.

2964
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:29,830
Two out of four?

2965
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:32,270
How do you guys...

2966
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,770
Don't say that!

2967
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:36,610
He has no reason to keep Dante alive.

2968
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:37,790
No!

2969
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:38,610
Dante's alive!

2970
02:15:39,930 --> 02:15:41,610
Don't just save words!

2971
02:15:43,630 --> 02:15:44,830
Upper right corner.

2972
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:45,770
Oh, did it show?

2973
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:47,270
And I missed it.

2974
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:47,310
Okay.

2975
02:15:50,950 --> 02:15:53,270
Oh my

2976
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:13,340
gosh.

2977
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:22,560
He's going again!

2978
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:23,660
Oh my gosh, okay.

2979
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,000
Good thing that we...

2980
02:16:32,970 --> 02:16:34,290
He's the big guy!

2981
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:48,280
He's released!

2982
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:56,140
Okay, let's keep reading.

2983
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:56,600
Wow.

2984
02:16:57,860 --> 02:17:00,240
So they do this...

2985
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:02,340
Oh gosh!

2986
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:05,240
Leave us alone!

2987
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:15,700
Nice!

2988
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:15,900
Oh!

2989
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:16,740
You too!

2990
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,580
Oh, you too!

2991
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:35,420
I think we refilled our D2 though.

2992
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:37,700
Which is good!

2993
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:39,780
Good, good, good!

2994
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:44,500
Don't speak!

2995
02:17:48,980 --> 02:17:50,220
Can these be broken?

2996
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:51,400
I wish these could be broken.

2997
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:55,540
Who knows what corpses hold...

2998
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,480
They could hold value.

2999
02:17:59,180 --> 02:17:59,600
Wait...

3000
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:01,620
Wait...

3001
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:02,160
Skateboard!

3002
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:08,240
Aha!

3003
02:18:09,140 --> 02:18:12,500
I think Nero's doing a splendid job right now.

3004
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:17,720
He only lost it a little bit.

3005
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:19,200
Right?

3006
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:19,640
Right?

3007
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:20,800
Oh, it wasn't his fault!

3008
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:21,780
Oh my gosh, sorry.

3009
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:22,220
The camera.

3010
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:24,740
Gorb.

3011
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:27,740
Yeah, Nero totally is not losing it.

3012
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:31,340
I wonder how many of these I have.

3013
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:33,760
Honestly, I could probably start using them.

3014
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:35,320
When I...

3015
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:37,400
If I'm like really close in battle, you know?

3016
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:40,140
I get a free one every day.

3017
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:43,920
Who dat?

3018
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:45,540
Oh, creepy.

3019
02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:48,980
No.

3020
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,780
Oh no.

3021
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:52,780
My nightmare.

3022
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:54,500
My literal nightmare.

3023
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:57,440
Shadow, I need you to get a little closer.

3024
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:57,720
Okay.

3025
02:18:58,060 --> 02:18:58,840
Yeah.

3026
02:19:07,220 --> 02:19:08,000
Ooh!

3027
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:08,880
He's chasing me!

3028
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:10,820
Ooh!

3029
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:12,060
Shadow.

3030
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:15,280
Don't get snipped.

3031
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:19,480
It's like...

3032
02:19:20,240 --> 02:19:21,040
The...

3033
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:21,840
The...

3034
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,400
Thing is like...

3035
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,100
It's...

3036
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:25,720
It's...

3037
02:19:26,130 --> 02:19:26,520
Time...

3038
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:27,680
For you to go to the vet.

3039
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:34,580
Shadows getting neutered today.

3040
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:46,980
Thank you!

3041
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:47,800
That's me!

3042
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:50,240
Oh.

3043
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:51,940
Dang it.

3044
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:55,780
Seems like he was close and then I missed the window.

3045
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:02,560
Yay!

3046
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:04,060
Oh, are there more?

3047
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,260
Oh, yes.

3048
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,420
Yes, quite a few.

3049
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:11,100
Just a few more.

3050
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:13,020
Oh, yes more.

3051
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:14,260
Yes, more more.

3052
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:15,920
Sick skills.

3053
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:20,540
Take him out!

3054
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:21,400
Take him out!

3055
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:23,500
Hit him to the wall.

3056
02:20:25,460 --> 02:20:26,960
I'm like right on top of him.

3057
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:32,560
You can DT whatever...

3058
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:33,640
Now I'm nervous too.

3059
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,120
But right now we're doing okay.

3060
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:38,260
I'm not bad.

3061
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:40,840
Rest in pieces maybe.

3062
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:56,480
Oh, okay.

3063
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:57,100
That's me.

3064
02:20:57,600 --> 02:20:58,240
Uh, you go.

3065
02:20:58,980 --> 02:20:59,640
Wait, you go.

3066
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:03,180
Yeah, yeah, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go.

3067
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:05,600
Keep that, keep doing that, keep doing that.

3068
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:08,680
Not yet.

3069
02:21:10,060 --> 02:21:10,380
Almost.

3070
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:14,340
There we go.

3071
02:21:19,930 --> 02:21:20,290
Okay.

3072
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:21,850
Oh, yeah.

3073
02:21:23,170 --> 02:21:24,530
Anything around here?

3074
02:21:25,790 --> 02:21:28,030
No, doesn't seem to be the case.

3075
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:34,190
I don't need DT because ROCK BEAT SCISSORS.

3076
02:21:36,950 --> 02:21:37,730
So true.

3077
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:40,430
I can't see.

3078
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:41,990
I don't, I don't know.

3079
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:45,330
A shadow, the shadow skateboard makes me dizzy.

3080
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:47,030
A little bit.

3081
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:49,970
I get like a little motion sickness from it.

3082
02:21:51,330 --> 02:21:52,630
Because it's so fast.

3083
02:21:54,030 --> 02:21:55,490
Go back and stand on the coffin.

3084
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:57,070
Do I get some rewards?

3085
02:21:57,370 --> 02:21:57,650
Thank you.

3086
02:22:01,730 --> 02:22:03,550
Wait, which, this coffin in here?

3087
02:22:07,010 --> 02:22:07,990
This one?

3088
02:22:08,330 --> 02:22:10,550
This one?

3089
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:16,150
Give me.

3090
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:18,410
Whoa!

3091
02:22:20,210 --> 02:22:20,950
Whoa!

3092
02:22:22,130 --> 02:22:24,470
Guys, do you see how many rewards we have right now?

3093
02:22:36,450 --> 02:22:37,260
Thank you.

3094
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:39,000
For that tip.

3095
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:42,500
Why are you giving me these?

3096
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:47,480
Are we about near the end?

3097
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:48,660
Oh.

3098
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:54,780
Check and see if it still works.

3099
02:22:54,980 --> 02:22:55,140
Yeah.

3100
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:01,480
Even if I don't need Nico, I still always want to call her to see what happens in the cutscene.

3101
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:13,800
He didn't even say anything.

3102
02:23:14,140 --> 02:23:15,200
Don't be rude, V.

3103
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:22,960
Oh my god, he's taunting him.

3104
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:24,100
What?

3105
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:28,820
He's...

3106
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,540
This feels like a crime.

3107
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:32,160
Oh.

3108
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:41,980
Did he just call him a fat fuck?

3109
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:45,780
Impressive.

3110
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:50,320
I didn't see any subtitles for it though.

3111
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:54,820
Sure did.

3112
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,000
Nice.

3113
02:23:57,940 --> 02:23:59,160
Guys, give me one second.

3114
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:00,720
You can hang out with Nico for a bit.

3115
02:24:00,820 --> 02:24:02,100
I'm gonna go grab some more water.

3116
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:05,300
I'm gonna go grab some water real quick.

3117
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,160
I'm back.

3118
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:30,260
I accidentally...

3119
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:31,760
I almost put on my headphones.

3120
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,280
Like my big headphones.

3121
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:35,660
Time for the earbuds.

3122
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:38,260
I'm gonna also have a quick snack break.

3123
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:41,900
Quick snack break.

3124
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,180
I've got some calorie, mate.

3125
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:48,160
Cause I don't want to spoil my dinner.

3126
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:03,020
Just stopping by and say I got my good morning Minto chocolate bar.

3127
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:03,480
Oh.

3128
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:07,160
Awesome.

3129
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:08,280
Oh my gosh, do I go?

3130
02:26:08,360 --> 02:26:08,780
Thank you so much.

3131
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:10,120
Thank you.

3132
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:14,490
Which flavor?

3133
02:26:15,330 --> 02:26:15,730
Chocolate.

3134
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:23,660
Chocolate, chocolate.

3135
02:26:29,870 --> 02:26:30,490
Let's see.

3136
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:44,190
Do I even want to buy anything?

3137
02:26:46,510 --> 02:26:48,010
Is my big question.

3138
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:52,870
Do I even want to buy anything?

3139
02:27:10,910 --> 02:27:13,590
I feel like...

3140
02:27:15,070 --> 02:27:16,390
Oh, we can upgrade.

3141
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:17,150
Wait, upgrade.

3142
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:21,790
Okay.

3143
02:27:22,230 --> 02:27:23,030
Save for Nero.

3144
02:27:24,050 --> 02:27:25,470
I think I agree.

3145
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:27,850
I think I agree.

3146
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:31,290
But this is also good.

3147
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:33,890
He takes some...

3148
02:27:33,890 --> 02:27:35,010
He's increased defense.

3149
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:37,090
Increased defense.

3150
02:27:40,010 --> 02:27:41,870
I was gonna say some of the...

3151
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:46,250
Some of the combos that are just like not with lock on.

3152
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:48,130
Because locking on is so hard.

3153
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:49,950
I would save up.

3154
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:50,270
Yeah.

3155
02:27:51,730 --> 02:27:52,290
Okay.

3156
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:53,330
We'll save up.

3157
02:27:54,470 --> 02:27:55,390
I could wait.

3158
02:27:56,130 --> 02:27:57,470
I could buy a blurb.

3159
02:28:08,370 --> 02:28:08,710
One.

3160
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:09,510
Welcome to membership.

3161
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:10,090
Thank you.

3162
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:14,290
And a blurb.

3163
02:28:17,170 --> 02:28:19,270
That's like so much already.

3164
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:24,010
Try the ending boss first.

3165
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:24,330
Yeah.

3166
02:28:24,450 --> 02:28:24,930
We'll try it.

3167
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:26,570
That's true.

3168
02:28:26,650 --> 02:28:27,350
We can try first.

3169
02:28:31,970 --> 02:28:34,090
Also, there's more robs right there.

3170
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:37,850
We could have had even more money.

3171
02:28:38,370 --> 02:28:40,190
Aw, you missed your mommy.

3172
02:28:40,530 --> 02:28:41,670
You need a hug?

3173
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:44,810
Why are they always talking about his mom?

3174
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:45,170
Oh.

3175
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:47,090
I just noticed that.

3176
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:48,190
This...

3177
02:28:48,190 --> 02:28:48,790
Presence.

3178
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:49,250
Oh.

3179
02:28:49,530 --> 02:28:51,130
It's the devil's sword, Sparta.

3180
02:28:51,630 --> 02:28:53,090
No doubt about it.

3181
02:28:54,350 --> 02:28:54,850
Um.

3182
02:28:55,050 --> 02:28:56,210
Do I need a DT here?

3183
02:28:56,910 --> 02:28:57,410
Or...

3184
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:02,580
Oh, wait.

3185
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:03,080
I'm sorry.

3186
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:03,980
I just noticed this.

3187
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:07,760
Oh, it's these guys!

3188
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:11,940
Oh.

3189
02:29:17,980 --> 02:29:18,480
Nobody!

3190
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:22,220
Oh.

3191
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:25,320
I'll be taking that back.

3192
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:26,620
That back.

3193
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:32,660
You know your endless worshipping isn't making Sparta any happier.

3194
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:36,720
Kingdom Hearts nobodies?

3195
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:41,860
What the?

3196
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:42,820
Already?

3197
02:29:48,570 --> 02:29:49,090
Already?

3198
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:51,490
Uh...

3199
02:29:51,490 --> 02:29:51,950
That's not good.

3200
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:56,110
If that's too tactic.

3201
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:58,410
I'll be sure to watch out the line.

3202
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,930
Wait.

3203
02:29:59,210 --> 02:29:59,670
So...

3204
02:29:59,670 --> 02:30:00,070
Hold on.

3205
02:30:01,210 --> 02:30:02,410
It's my turn.

3206
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:03,690
I'll leave the devil's sword.

3207
02:30:03,890 --> 02:30:05,170
Let's go after the algae.

3208
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:07,050
The one that's actually attacking us!

3209
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:21,820
Shuffering!

3210
02:30:23,580 --> 02:30:24,320
Get grabbed.

3211
02:30:24,700 --> 02:30:25,880
Oh, I saw an eyeball.

3212
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:30,280
Slice and dice them, baby.

3213
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:34,260
Six skills!

3214
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,280
Where's the other guy?

3215
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,000
Oh, here he is.

3216
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:47,740
Spoken sexy style!

3217
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:50,600
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3218
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:55,230
Just...

3219
02:30:56,730 --> 02:30:57,450
Angelu...

3220
02:30:57,450 --> 02:30:59,390
Long life!han141 Absolutely.

3221
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:02,250
They don't want us.

3222
02:31:02,690 --> 02:31:03,210
Oh!

3223
02:31:03,810 --> 02:31:04,530
Ouch!

3224
02:31:04,970 --> 02:31:05,410
Ouch!

3225
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:06,190
Ouch!

3226
02:31:07,410 --> 02:31:08,950
Come on, come on, come on.

3227
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:09,730
Let me, let me...

3228
02:31:09,730 --> 02:31:11,130
Oh, no, no, wrong guy.

3229
02:31:11,790 --> 02:31:12,390
This guy.

3230
02:31:12,530 --> 02:31:14,130
Please, please, let me teleport.

3231
02:31:14,430 --> 02:31:14,810
Teleport.

3232
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:15,210
There we go.

3233
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:18,810
Okay, oh... No!

3234
02:31:19,270 --> 02:31:20,010
I had him!

3235
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:20,710
What the hell?

3236
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:26,570
Oh my gosh.

3237
02:31:34,730 --> 02:31:35,910
Oh, I did get him?

3238
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:38,750
How... buddy, like, it looked like he came back to life.

3239
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:44,940
Oh my god.

3240
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:45,900
No ice.

3241
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:47,000
No!

3242
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:49,860
You can do it, please.

3243
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:55,470
And I eat while you do it.

3244
02:32:11,170 --> 02:32:12,570
You stink.

3245
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:15,970
Oh!

3246
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:27,920
Oh god.

3247
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:29,580
It's too heavy for him!

3248
02:32:34,450 --> 02:32:36,190
Use those noodle arms!

3249
02:32:37,830 --> 02:32:40,750
It seems this sword is still too strong for me.

3250
02:32:41,130 --> 02:32:43,290
So close, so close.

3251
02:32:43,450 --> 02:32:44,710
You got a lot of heart, kid.

3252
02:32:44,830 --> 02:32:47,410
You really do, but you're a bit of a sissy in the strength department.

3253
02:32:47,410 --> 02:32:50,790
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

3254
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:51,550
No offense, son.

3255
02:32:51,770 --> 02:32:51,930
You know.

3256
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:53,610
That kid Nero.

3257
02:32:54,230 --> 02:32:55,630
He has the strength.

3258
02:32:56,550 --> 02:32:56,950
Yeah.

3259
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:58,830
It speaks.

3260
02:32:59,750 --> 02:33:00,350
Oh.

3261
02:33:01,790 --> 02:33:02,770
Who's talking?

3262
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:08,170
I can't.

3263
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:10,330
The way she's just dragging it around.

3264
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:13,030
Dante.

3265
02:33:16,770 --> 02:33:17,570
Oh!

3266
02:33:20,670 --> 02:33:21,770
No way.

3267
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:24,370
Oh my god, they, he dyed his hair.

3268
02:33:31,910 --> 02:33:32,590
Dante.

3269
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:42,460
Dante.

3270
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,220
I don't even have the words.

3271
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:44,880
I...

3272
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:46,000
He's alive!

3273
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:47,100
He's alive!

3274
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:48,100
Yeah, he's alive!

3275
02:33:48,460 --> 02:33:49,520
The double sword, Sparta.

3276
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:52,320
Was concealing Dante's presence.

3277
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:52,800
Oh.

3278
02:33:53,360 --> 02:33:56,260
How does one friggin' guy have so much luck, huh?

3279
02:33:57,800 --> 02:33:58,980
No, he's alive.

3280
02:33:59,380 --> 02:33:59,500
V?

3281
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:01,740
No, no, no.

3282
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:02,980
Get equipped with yourself now.

3283
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:03,420
Come on.

3284
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:05,500
If only you could defeat Urazin.

3285
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:08,460
If only...

3286
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:08,720
Oh?

3287
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:10,300
Hello?

3288
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:10,980
V?

3289
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:11,880
No, no, no.

3290
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:12,260
V?

3291
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:13,320
V?

3292
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:14,820
V?

3293
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:16,200
If only you never existed.

3294
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:17,120
V?

3295
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:21,100
Then I...

3296
02:34:21,620 --> 02:34:22,280
Don't do it.

3297
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:23,040
No, no, no.

3298
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:23,180
Ah!

3299
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:31,690
Damn.

3300
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:35,230
I got an S on that?

3301
02:34:35,410 --> 02:34:36,170
No kidding.

3302
02:34:37,210 --> 02:34:39,330
I have 90,000 worms.

3303
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:42,610
Yo, the cliffhanger.

3304
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:47,210
See, he's not dead.

3305
02:34:47,550 --> 02:34:48,570
He's alive.

3306
02:34:49,110 --> 02:34:51,630
He was even being held so graciously...

3307
02:34:51,630 --> 02:34:53,430
like so delicately by that statue.

3308
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:56,190
Come here.

3309
02:34:56,810 --> 02:34:57,130
Oh.

3310
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:03,180
No, don't shove me in the closet.

3311
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:03,880
You need to hide Dante.

3312
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:05,940
No matter what happens, you mustn't leave.

3313
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:06,780
Mom?

3314
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:08,120
Wait.

3315
02:35:08,540 --> 02:35:09,500
I need to find Virgil.

3316
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:10,920
I promise I'll be back.

3317
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:11,260
Oh.

3318
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:12,500
I know this is hard.

3319
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:14,160
You must listen to me.

3320
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:15,740
Be a big boy.

3321
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:16,640
A man.

3322
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:17,980
I'm a man.

3323
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:18,720
Okay.

3324
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:18,740
Okay.

3325
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:20,840
Mom.

3326
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:25,660
If I don't return, you must run.

3327
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:27,700
By yourself, alone.

3328
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:28,440
No, mom.

3329
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:29,080
You'll come back.

3330
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:30,120
You must change your name.

3331
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:30,340
Oh.

3332
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:32,420
Forget your past and start a new life.

3333
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:34,400
As someone else.

3334
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:36,780
A new beginning.

3335
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:38,260
No.

3336
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:39,560
Where are you?

3337
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:39,740
No.

3338
02:35:39,740 --> 02:35:41,080
Well, clearly he didn't do that.

3339
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:44,740
That was fast.

3340
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:45,300
Oh my god.

3341
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:46,840
She just ran in there.

3342
02:35:52,570 --> 02:35:53,810
Change your name to...

3343
02:35:53,810 --> 02:35:54,330
Oh, Tony.

3344
02:35:54,770 --> 02:35:55,670
Yes, I remember.

3345
02:35:59,270 --> 02:36:00,150
Tony Redgrave.

3346
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:01,170
Yes, I remember.

3347
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:04,210
For a second there, I thought you were going to shish kabah me.

3348
02:36:04,990 --> 02:36:06,990
I know how stubborn you can be.

3349
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:10,030
I thought it might be the only way to wake you.

3350
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:10,950
Tony Redgrave era.

3351
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:12,370
I forgot about that.

3352
02:36:12,390 --> 02:36:13,550
I'll do is it.

3353
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:15,750
The 15th of June.

3354
02:36:17,470 --> 02:36:18,270
A month.

3355
02:36:21,410 --> 02:36:22,010
Pretty long nap.

3356
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:22,910
No wonder I'm so stiff.

3357
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:25,430
Right, sunshine.

3358
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:26,490
Now put a fire under it.

3359
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:27,690
We got to get going because that annoying.

3360
02:36:31,310 --> 02:36:32,350
Oh, my child.

3361
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:41,170
Okay, but you were like, out of commission for a whole month.

3362
02:36:48,410 --> 02:36:49,630
He's just a baby.

3363
02:36:51,090 --> 02:36:52,350
He's my little baby.

3364
02:36:52,770 --> 02:36:55,110
He's much stronger than we ever could have imagined.

3365
02:36:58,870 --> 02:37:01,030
I think even Dante will agree with that.

3366
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:06,490
May 15th.

3367
02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:11,570
This timeline is getting my head all screwy.

3368
02:37:15,730 --> 02:37:16,730
Hi, Trish.

3369
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:18,270
Oh, it stinks in here.

3370
02:37:18,350 --> 02:37:19,130
Hi, lady.

3371
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:19,790
I know.

3372
02:37:20,250 --> 02:37:21,770
It smells like hot garbage.

3373
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,900
This is far worse than I thought.

3374
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:31,400
There's no crime in turning tail, V.

3375
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:34,360
These things might be a little too much for you.

3376
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:35,640
You're right.

3377
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:38,340
I'll leave the rest to you.

3378
02:37:38,520 --> 02:37:38,960
Okay.

3379
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:41,560
Okay.

3380
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:42,440
He was like, yeah, you're right.

3381
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:43,280
Okay.

3382
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:48,040
One must always have an insurance policy.

3383
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:50,300
Okay, bye.

3384
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:50,560
Who was that guy?

3385
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:51,920
I can't believe he just ran.

3386
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:53,080
No one special.

3387
02:37:53,460 --> 02:37:54,020
Come on.

3388
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,920
Let's go clean up this garbage.

3389
02:37:57,160 --> 02:37:57,480
Hm.

3390
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:01,360
First come, first serve on the targets, raw.

3391
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:02,460
Music to my ears.

3392
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:03,340
Hurry up, Dante.

3393
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:09,220
Guess I get to see it with my own eyes.

3394
02:38:10,540 --> 02:38:11,960
If it really is you.

3395
02:38:12,700 --> 02:38:13,220
Whoa.

3396
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:16,020
Whoa.

3397
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:23,330
Player change Dante!

3398
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:28,440
Oh my god.

3399
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:33,180
Dante game mode.

3400
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:36,380
Guns and soul... Wait, what's...

3401
02:38:39,160 --> 02:38:40,360
What is the equipment?

3402
02:38:40,660 --> 02:38:41,340
What am I looking at?

3403
02:38:43,060 --> 02:38:45,960
Oh, they won't let us buy any skills or anything.

3404
02:38:46,140 --> 02:38:46,680
That's interesting.

3405
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:51,100
But we can buy porbs and blurbs!

3406
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:02,500
I'm gonna buy a blurb.

3407
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:06,600
Yippee.

3408
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:09,920
Um...

3409
02:39:10,700 --> 02:39:11,620
I'm gonna...

3410
02:39:11,620 --> 02:39:12,520
See...

3411
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:13,700
What happens now.

3412
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:15,740
Before I do anything else.

3413
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:18,780
I'm gonna wait until...

3414
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:19,480
Because I...

3415
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:21,660
Because the blurbs transfer over...

3416
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:22,820
To everybody.

3417
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:23,660
So it's...

3418
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:25,360
It's not bad to have...

3419
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:26,340
In general.

3420
02:39:26,340 --> 02:39:26,440
In general.

3421
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:28,630
But...

3422
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:30,420
I'll...

3423
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:31,340
Yes.

3424
02:39:31,740 --> 02:39:33,140
What the heck is happening here?

3425
02:39:38,110 --> 02:39:38,500
Okay.

3426
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:41,100
Mission status!

3427
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:46,180
So does porb except for Nero.

3428
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:47,340
Yeah, well...

3429
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:47,800
Yeah.

3430
02:39:49,180 --> 02:39:50,620
Look how cute they are!

3431
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:51,900
Hehehehe.

3432
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:54,740
They're so cute.

3433
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:56,640
Changing weapons.

3434
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:57,460
L-T-R-T.

3435
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:58,800
You can quickly change your weapon...

3436
02:39:58,800 --> 02:39:59,780
Press L-T...

3437
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:01,740
To change long range weapons.

3438
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:03,900
And R-T to change close range weapons.

3439
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:06,000
Whoa!

3440
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:07,100
Look at the armor!

3441
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:08,160
Who?

3442
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:09,460
Did that guy really do this?

3443
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:11,080
Well...

3444
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:12,420
There's no accounting for taste.

3445
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:13,920
What?

3446
02:40:14,660 --> 02:40:15,680
Oh my god.

3447
02:40:36,950 --> 02:40:37,690
Okay, okay!

3448
02:40:38,010 --> 02:40:38,430
Oh gosh!

3449
02:40:38,530 --> 02:40:39,410
It's all coming back!

3450
02:40:40,630 --> 02:40:42,070
It's all coming back.

3451
02:40:43,250 --> 02:40:46,450
Okay, let's try it before we try rebellion.

3452
02:40:48,390 --> 02:40:50,210
Yeah, give me some easy guys.

3453
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:54,650
Test it out on... Oh

3454
02:40:57,750 --> 02:40:58,190
my god!

3455
02:40:58,690 --> 02:40:59,230
No!

3456
02:41:00,650 --> 02:41:01,670
There it is.

3457
02:41:02,210 --> 02:41:03,110
Oh boy.

3458
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:06,990
Wait.

3459
02:41:07,430 --> 02:41:08,310
Oh, there it is.

3460
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:10,110
Oh, oh, there it is.

3461
02:41:10,430 --> 02:41:11,850
Oh, there it is.

3462
02:41:37,070 --> 02:41:37,870
Where's the other guy?

3463
02:41:38,430 --> 02:41:39,230
Oh, there it is.

3464
02:41:47,150 --> 02:41:48,470
Oh, I'm not close enough.

3465
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:49,910
Oh, oh.

3466
02:41:50,090 --> 02:41:50,210
Oh.

3467
02:41:54,290 --> 02:41:55,610
I see, I see, I see.

3468
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:58,030
Oh, more?

3469
02:42:02,390 --> 02:42:03,330
This is crazy.

3470
02:42:03,670 --> 02:42:05,230
I get into the boat that's lost.

3471
02:42:05,810 --> 02:42:07,170
Oh my god.

3472
02:42:09,890 --> 02:42:11,190
Oh, wow.

3473
02:42:11,990 --> 02:42:12,290
Okay.

3474
02:42:13,150 --> 02:42:13,750
Golly.

3475
02:42:15,510 --> 02:42:17,790
Because I used rebellion so often.

3476
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:18,810
Sorry.

3477
02:42:19,050 --> 02:42:23,230
Because I used rebellion so often, it's weird fighting with these, but...

3478
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:25,130
I don't hate it.

3479
02:42:25,150 --> 02:42:25,610
Oh.

3480
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,790
Yeah.

3481
02:42:33,150 --> 02:42:35,330
Trish and Lady are so fast.

3482
02:42:37,610 --> 02:42:38,750
There she is.

3483
02:42:39,230 --> 02:42:40,050
Hi, Lady.

3484
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:42,450
And Devil Trigger.

3485
02:42:42,870 --> 02:42:43,010
Yay.

3486
02:42:43,910 --> 02:42:44,890
Wait, what was it?

3487
02:42:46,170 --> 02:42:47,370
Aim back.

3488
02:42:47,990 --> 02:42:49,030
Oh, there it is.

3489
02:42:49,030 --> 02:42:49,550
I got it.

3490
02:42:49,550 --> 02:42:49,550
I got it.

3491
02:42:52,870 --> 02:42:53,730
Oh, oh, oh.

3492
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:54,330
Oh, okay.

3493
02:42:55,650 --> 02:42:56,450
Oh, damn.

3494
02:42:58,890 --> 02:43:01,890
I don't want a Devil Trigger just now, but...

3495
02:43:02,810 --> 02:43:03,810
I don't need to.

3496
02:43:04,490 --> 02:43:05,170
Look at them.

3497
02:43:05,250 --> 02:43:06,350
They're just staring at me.

3498
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:20,780
What was it?

3499
02:43:21,840 --> 02:43:22,260
Uh...

3500
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:23,940
There was like... Oh, it was this one.

3501
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:32,960
There was...

3502
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,280
Hold Y.

3503
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:34,400
Hold Y.

3504
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:52,600
It's too.

3505
02:43:52,860 --> 02:43:53,820
It's so good.

3506
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:15,840
They don't even stand a chance.

3507
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:18,140
Oh my gosh.

3508
02:44:19,780 --> 02:44:21,500
I'm getting there.

3509
02:44:22,220 --> 02:44:22,720
Okay.

3510
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:23,040
Oh.

3511
02:44:23,620 --> 02:44:24,820
I'll eat that.

3512
02:44:29,400 --> 02:44:31,360
Look, they're still so cocky.

3513
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:35,840
Wait,

3514
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:41,180
now can I buy things?

3515
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:48,720
No!

3516
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:56,980
Oh my god... I

3517
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:07,720
can at least get Stinger.

3518
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:08,960
Stinger's cheap enough, I'll get it.

3519
02:45:21,950 --> 02:45:23,390
Oh my god.

3520
02:45:24,430 --> 02:45:25,910
Oh my god!

3521
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:45,280
How... How... Okay, without spoiling too much, if I buy all of this, and then I just play as Nero for the rest of the game, what was the point?

3522
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:45,400
Wait.

3523
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:01,570
New game plus.

3524
02:46:02,730 --> 02:46:03,550
Oh, see?

3525
02:46:03,750 --> 02:46:05,450
Oh, that's not really applicable here.

3526
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:09,810
You'll play as Dante often enough.

3527
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:20,260
Okay... Okay...

3528
02:46:24,510 --> 02:46:32,510
Hmm... Then... I'm definitely gonna get...

3529
02:46:34,350 --> 02:46:36,370
I'm gonna get...

3530
02:46:36,370 --> 02:46:39,850
The style level 2 for Sword Master.

3531
02:46:40,690 --> 02:46:41,650
I think.

3532
02:46:43,730 --> 02:46:45,530
Cause I'll use this one...

3533
02:46:47,670 --> 02:46:48,550
And Trickster.

3534
02:46:56,220 --> 02:46:58,600
This... Those are always the ones that I use the most anyway.

3535
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:01,360
Flipper.

3536
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:04,500
I'm giving them the bird.

3537
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:06,880
Coyote.

3538
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:07,820
Oven and Ivory.

3539
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,100
Maybe I will go back to Rebellion then.

3540
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:11,700
Hahaha.

3541
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,420
But this was so fun.

3542
02:47:21,990 --> 02:47:22,870
Air hike, yeah.

3543
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:24,010
Oh, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.

3544
02:47:24,270 --> 02:47:24,750
No, no, no.

3545
02:47:25,630 --> 02:47:26,430
Air hike.

3546
02:47:28,610 --> 02:47:29,410
And speed.

3547
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:35,770
Trigger heart is always good too.

3548
02:47:36,950 --> 02:47:39,190
Yeah, trigger heart is always good too.

3549
02:47:40,850 --> 02:47:41,410
Okay.

3550
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:45,770
Those are pretty much all the abilities that I need anyway.

3551
02:47:47,730 --> 02:47:48,290
Um...

3552
02:47:48,290 --> 02:47:49,630
Million stab.

3553
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:51,970
Is this more powerful than it was before?

3554
02:47:52,130 --> 02:47:53,330
Because before it wasn't so great.

3555
02:47:53,530 --> 02:47:53,950
Hahaha.

3556
02:47:58,040 --> 02:47:59,300
Oh my gosh, you're right.

3557
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:01,300
Hey, air hike isn't weapon locked anymore.

3558
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:02,480
I didn't even think about that.

3559
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:04,040
That's so nice.

3560
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:07,460
Oh wait, we're on ball rogue.

3561
02:48:08,040 --> 02:48:09,460
I could get my stinger or...

3562
02:48:15,210 --> 02:48:17,130
I do like them in a rebellion.

3563
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:24,280
Activate ten counts in blow mode.

3564
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:26,260
Or heat up in kick mode.

3565
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:34,000
Press A.

3566
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:34,620
Hahaha.

3567
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:38,440
Press A.

3568
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:39,520
So easy.

3569
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:40,820
Easiest move ever.

3570
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:42,220
Wait.

3571
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:43,080
Wait.

3572
02:48:43,240 --> 02:48:44,120
Is this just like...

3573
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:45,560
It just kicks them while I jump?

3574
02:48:47,220 --> 02:48:48,020
No way.

3575
02:48:51,860 --> 02:48:52,380
Blast wave.

3576
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:53,820
Oh my god!

3577
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:56,380
At least it does like...

3578
02:48:56,380 --> 02:48:56,480
Oh.

3579
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:04,200
Wait.

3580
02:49:04,320 --> 02:49:05,860
Is this what you guys were wanting me to do?

3581
02:49:06,580 --> 02:49:06,980
Or...

3582
02:49:06,980 --> 02:49:07,180
Or...

3583
02:49:07,180 --> 02:49:08,420
Do I need to be locked on?

3584
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:16,480
Oh, hold it.

3585
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:20,920
Wait.

3586
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:21,660
Hold...

3587
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:23,800
Hold Y in kick mode.

3588
02:49:24,220 --> 02:49:24,400
Wait.

3589
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:25,480
What do you mean kick mode?

3590
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:26,760
How do I get to kick mode?

3591
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:30,520
What's kick mode?

3592
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:34,660
What's kick mode?

3593
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:43,940
Back Y.

3594
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:44,320
Okay.

3595
02:49:51,330 --> 02:49:51,930
Whoa.

3596
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:52,670
Whoa.

3597
02:49:52,930 --> 02:49:53,250
Whoa.

3598
02:49:53,550 --> 02:49:53,810
Whoa.

3599
02:49:55,530 --> 02:49:57,010
He's stylin'.

3600
02:49:57,010 --> 02:49:57,550
Wow.

3601
02:50:00,830 --> 02:50:01,430
Wow.

3602
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:02,210
Look at him go.

3603
02:50:03,010 --> 02:50:03,610
Wait.

3604
02:50:03,850 --> 02:50:04,430
Go forward.

3605
02:50:05,050 --> 02:50:06,290
Go close to him.

3606
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:06,810
Wait.

3607
02:50:06,870 --> 02:50:11,010
How do I get... I just... I'm just... That's it.

3608
02:50:15,730 --> 02:50:16,590
That's it?

3609
02:50:18,770 --> 02:50:19,530
Press B.

3610
02:50:19,710 --> 02:50:20,910
I am, but nothing's happening.

3611
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:22,550
Do I keep holding?

3612
02:50:23,790 --> 02:50:24,890
Now press B.

3613
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:34,430
Wait,

3614
02:50:38,710 --> 02:50:39,790
why isn't it doing it now?

3615
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:43,090
Oh, there we go.

3616
02:50:43,370 --> 02:50:43,990
There we go.

3617
02:50:43,990 --> 02:50:45,170
He's moving.

3618
02:50:45,330 --> 02:50:45,650
He's moving.

3619
02:50:46,170 --> 02:50:46,730
Oh.

3620
02:50:47,390 --> 02:50:47,950
Yeah!

3621
02:50:52,850 --> 02:50:53,410
Hey.

3622
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:56,650
I don't even... I don't even need to press B for this.

3623
02:50:58,230 --> 02:51:01,290
I don't even need to press B or hold Y to do that.

3624
02:51:04,830 --> 02:51:09,990
Wait, if we're Rebellion, does he do the... Wait.

3625
02:51:10,850 --> 02:51:12,010
Switch back to...

3626
02:51:12,010 --> 02:51:12,990
Okay, yeah.

3627
02:51:13,090 --> 02:51:13,830
He does do that again.

3628
02:51:18,490 --> 02:51:20,870
And why does the fire... Oh, okay.

3629
02:51:21,130 --> 02:51:21,170
Okay.

3630
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:23,390
This is...

3631
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:26,590
Oh, wait.

3632
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:27,590
Then how do I...

3633
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:28,830
Ah, I see.

3634
02:51:28,970 --> 02:51:29,130
I see.

3635
02:51:29,890 --> 02:51:30,870
Oh, I see.

3636
02:51:30,930 --> 02:51:31,830
That's how you switch.

3637
02:51:32,290 --> 02:51:32,570
Okay.

3638
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:33,010
Okay.

3639
02:51:52,780 --> 02:51:54,140
Oh, my God!

3640
02:52:00,270 --> 02:52:01,310
Holy moly.

3641
02:52:02,290 --> 02:52:02,810
Okay.

3642
02:52:03,030 --> 02:52:03,750
I think I'm good.

3643
02:52:04,050 --> 02:52:06,750
We'll try... We'll try using Balrog, even though I...

3644
02:52:07,430 --> 02:52:10,970
Feel more comfortable with... With Rebellion, but...

3645
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:17,930
It's funny that out of all the weapons, they brought this one.

3646
02:52:19,170 --> 02:52:22,070
Of all the weapons from three, they brought this one.

3647
02:52:22,930 --> 02:52:23,630
Let's see.

3648
02:52:24,370 --> 02:52:24,890
Uh...

3649
02:52:24,890 --> 02:52:25,730
Heavy Jolt.

3650
02:52:26,350 --> 02:52:27,310
What is Heavy Jolt?

3651
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:30,930
After charging forward with Heavy Jolt...

3652
02:52:32,010 --> 02:52:33,170
Do I even have one?

3653
02:52:36,070 --> 02:52:36,590
Oh.

3654
02:52:36,810 --> 02:52:37,430
Oh, you're right.

3655
02:52:37,530 --> 02:52:38,270
This isn't...

3656
02:52:38,270 --> 02:52:38,410
Wait.

3657
02:52:40,590 --> 02:52:41,650
This one is new.

3658
02:52:41,930 --> 02:52:42,330
Oh, yeah.

3659
02:52:42,330 --> 02:52:42,710
You're right.

3660
02:52:42,910 --> 02:52:44,190
The other one was called Beowulf.

3661
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:45,350
Yeah!

3662
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:46,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3663
02:52:49,510 --> 02:52:50,570
Okay, okay, okay.

3664
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:51,190
That's right.

3665
02:52:53,550 --> 02:52:54,610
It was Beowulf.

3666
02:52:54,690 --> 02:52:55,510
They both start with B.

3667
02:52:56,190 --> 02:52:57,790
How could I forget Beowulf?

3668
02:52:57,890 --> 02:52:58,310
That fight.

3669
02:53:00,030 --> 02:53:01,050
How could I forget?

3670
02:53:03,610 --> 02:53:04,990
That's probably why I forgot.

3671
02:53:06,390 --> 02:53:06,790
I...

3672
02:53:07,350 --> 02:53:07,750
Um...

3673
02:53:08,410 --> 02:53:10,070
I sealed it away in my memories.

3674
02:53:14,810 --> 02:53:16,430
Okay, I'll learn this one.

3675
02:53:16,610 --> 02:53:16,950
Wait, no.

3676
02:53:17,010 --> 02:53:17,670
It's so expensive.

3677
02:53:19,450 --> 02:53:20,250
In kick mode.

3678
02:53:21,510 --> 02:53:22,030
Press...

3679
02:53:22,030 --> 02:53:23,990
R-B-L-S...

3680
02:53:23,990 --> 02:53:24,690
Forward...

3681
02:53:24,690 --> 02:53:25,490
Plus Y.

3682
02:53:27,610 --> 02:53:28,410
Off draft.

3683
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:30,970
In blow mode.

3684
02:53:33,410 --> 02:53:34,190
Okay, okay.

3685
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:34,890
Atrix again.

3686
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:35,370
Uh...

3687
02:53:35,370 --> 02:53:36,410
Press RB...

3688
02:53:37,090 --> 02:53:37,650
Left...

3689
02:53:37,650 --> 02:53:38,810
Left stick...

3690
02:53:38,810 --> 02:53:39,290
Forward...

3691
02:53:39,290 --> 02:53:39,410
Forward...

3692
02:53:39,410 --> 02:53:39,730
Plus Y.

3693
02:53:49,290 --> 02:53:50,510
Do I even...

3694
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:50,910
Is...

3695
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:52,130
I'm guessing I have...

3696
02:53:53,010 --> 02:53:54,070
Blow mode...

3697
02:53:54,070 --> 02:53:54,670
Like, automatically.

3698
02:53:56,110 --> 02:53:57,350
I'm in blow mode?

3699
02:53:57,730 --> 02:53:58,650
I'm in blow mode?

3700
02:53:59,690 --> 02:54:00,210
I'm in blow mode?

3701
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:02,970
Oh yeah, what's the equipment?

3702
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:06,450
Wait, so I can...

3703
02:54:07,990 --> 02:54:08,530
No.

3704
02:54:10,490 --> 02:54:11,930
I can't buy more.

3705
02:54:12,110 --> 02:54:12,630
So...

3706
02:54:12,630 --> 02:54:13,640
Surely I can't lose...

3707
02:54:13,970 --> 02:54:14,330
Them.

3708
02:54:16,510 --> 02:54:17,050
Surely.

3709
02:54:22,810 --> 02:54:24,110
I'll find more.

3710
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:28,850
Okay, I'm gonna hold off for now then.

3711
02:54:28,990 --> 02:54:30,010
Just so that we can...

3712
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:31,430
Get used to...

3713
02:54:31,430 --> 02:54:31,750
Get used to...

3714
02:54:31,750 --> 02:54:32,830
These things, you know?

3715
02:54:33,870 --> 02:54:35,790
Alright, now I have an air hike.

3716
02:54:38,130 --> 02:54:39,630
Which was everything I have there?

3717
02:54:39,670 --> 02:54:40,770
Look how cool he looks.

3718
02:54:41,550 --> 02:54:43,050
And we got speed...

3719
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:44,010
Oh.

3720
02:54:45,090 --> 02:54:45,770
Alright, let's

3721
02:54:49,250 --> 02:54:49,630
speed!

3722
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:56,700
Wow.

3723
02:54:57,140 --> 02:54:58,520
This is the worst...

3724
02:54:58,520 --> 02:55:00,560
Worst chainsaw ever.

3725
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:02,380
Took him forever to break that.

3726
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:05,980
There he goes!

3727
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:07,240
Oh, here he comes!

3728
02:55:10,220 --> 02:55:10,740
Chaos!

3729
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:13,080
Barb's Discord!

3730
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,540
I miss having my...

3731
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:24,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3732
02:55:33,670 --> 02:55:34,190
Oh.

3733
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:41,840
Oh my gosh.

3734
02:55:42,180 --> 02:55:43,700
I thought I wasn't gonna...

3735
02:55:44,080 --> 02:55:44,780
Oh.

3736
02:55:46,180 --> 02:55:46,880
No!

3737
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:47,600
Please!

3738
02:56:00,530 --> 02:56:01,270
Yeah!

3739
02:56:06,350 --> 02:56:07,850
Oh, there's another guy.

3740
02:56:18,830 --> 02:56:21,970
Oh my god!

3741
02:56:23,370 --> 02:56:23,990
He...

3742
02:56:26,890 --> 02:56:29,210
He didn't even have time to spin!

3743
02:56:30,570 --> 02:56:32,350
He didn't even have time!

3744
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:35,150
Jeez, Louise!

3745
02:56:36,150 --> 02:56:36,690
The cheese!

3746
02:56:38,710 --> 02:56:39,330
Wait.

3747
02:56:45,690 --> 02:56:47,350
I also gotta try Devil Trigger.

3748
02:56:47,990 --> 02:56:49,210
Wait, what am I...

3749
02:56:49,210 --> 02:56:49,630
Oh.

3750
02:56:50,030 --> 02:56:51,830
I'm in a cutscene, that's where I'm in.

3751
02:56:55,090 --> 02:56:56,350
Oh, is it?

3752
02:56:56,630 --> 02:56:57,230
Or...

3753
02:56:57,230 --> 02:56:58,170
Oh, okay.

3754
02:56:58,510 --> 02:56:58,910
Oh, okay.

3755
02:57:02,350 --> 02:57:04,450
I might actually become the Joker.

3756
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:18,600
Okay.

3757
02:57:32,470 --> 02:57:33,430
Oh, well, that's fine.

3758
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:43,040
My god!

3759
02:57:43,620 --> 02:57:44,220
Holy!

3760
02:57:44,220 --> 02:57:44,460
Holy!

3761
02:57:48,820 --> 02:57:49,860
I was trying to...

3762
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:51,440
I was trying to change from...

3763
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:53,280
From Sword Master to Trickster.

3764
02:57:53,460 --> 02:57:54,380
See what...

3765
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:56,860
There we go.

3766
02:57:57,800 --> 02:57:58,280
But...

3767
02:57:58,280 --> 02:57:58,820
Okay.

3768
02:57:59,020 --> 02:57:59,260
Alright.

3769
02:57:59,480 --> 02:57:59,900
Oh, sorry.

3770
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:01,260
I'm getting used to Dante again.

3771
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:08,240
Yeah!

3772
02:58:11,860 --> 02:58:12,660
Yeah!

3773
02:58:13,240 --> 02:58:13,660
Okay.

3774
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:18,080
Come here.

3775
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:24,340
No!

3776
02:58:25,440 --> 02:58:27,100
You son of a bitch!

3777
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:29,040
That's...

3778
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:29,920
That's what you get.

3779
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:33,960
I gotta be fast!

3780
02:58:34,760 --> 02:58:35,240
No!

3781
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:36,440
Dante, where are you going?

3782
02:58:44,210 --> 02:58:45,170
Please, kill them!

3783
02:58:45,550 --> 02:58:46,070
Kill them!

3784
02:58:46,730 --> 02:58:47,410
Oh my god.

3785
02:58:49,070 --> 02:58:50,650
It's hard when I don't have sword.

3786
02:58:55,830 --> 02:58:56,310
No!

3787
02:58:56,310 --> 02:58:56,430
No!

3788
02:58:58,190 --> 02:58:59,270
You bastard!

3789
02:59:00,370 --> 02:59:01,710
It's all your fault!

3790
02:59:02,030 --> 02:59:03,390
It's all your fault!

3791
02:59:05,850 --> 02:59:06,930
I was...

3792
02:59:06,930 --> 02:59:08,110
Right there.

3793
02:59:11,890 --> 02:59:13,130
You do have sword.

3794
02:59:13,290 --> 02:59:15,070
Yeah, but I'm trying to learn a new weapon!

3795
02:59:15,070 --> 02:59:15,190
Yeah!

3796
02:59:20,130 --> 02:59:20,790
What the?

3797
02:59:20,930 --> 02:59:21,110
Oh.

3798
02:59:21,510 --> 02:59:22,510
I was like, who's counting?

3799
02:59:24,210 --> 02:59:25,350
Aw, shucks.

3800
02:59:26,710 --> 02:59:28,450
I was trying to learn, you guys!

3801
02:59:28,630 --> 02:59:29,230
Let me learn!

3802
02:59:29,750 --> 02:59:30,250
Let me learn!

3803
02:59:45,370 --> 02:59:45,890
Oh!

3804
02:59:48,890 --> 02:59:49,290
Hello!

3805
02:59:59,180 --> 02:59:59,740
Come here.

3806
03:00:01,640 --> 03:00:02,740
Give me your warbs!

3807
03:00:03,300 --> 03:00:04,120
Give me your warbs!

3808
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:04,700
Oh!

3809
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:06,100
Spawn!

3810
03:00:06,360 --> 03:00:06,580
Spawn!

3811
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:08,640
Spawn!

3812
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:15,780
That was easy.

3813
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:19,480
Give me your warbs.

3814
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:25,660
Okay.

3815
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:27,580
Do these ever give me anything?

3816
03:00:27,740 --> 03:00:28,480
Or no, I wonder.

3817
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:30,580
I haven't been...

3818
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:32,260
What does he say?

3819
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:33,140
Is he counting?

3820
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:35,320
Nine!

3821
03:00:40,010 --> 03:00:40,530
Oh!

3822
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:42,870
Because it's the fire mode.

3823
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:44,070
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

3824
03:00:50,830 --> 03:00:51,950
Dress, there we go.

3825
03:00:52,870 --> 03:00:53,370
Teehee.

3826
03:00:53,650 --> 03:00:54,230
Any more?

3827
03:00:56,580 --> 03:00:57,940
Where'd Lady and Trish go?

3828
03:00:59,640 --> 03:01:00,140
No!

3829
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:00,760
Okay.

3830
03:01:01,380 --> 03:01:01,520
Alright.

3831
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,440
Alright, we got it this time.

3832
03:01:03,900 --> 03:01:04,000
Oh.

3833
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:11,720
Don't let him have a chance.

3834
03:01:11,720 --> 03:01:13,300
Just stun lock him.

3835
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:14,760
Just stun lock him.

3836
03:01:16,020 --> 03:01:16,820
Just stun lock him.

3837
03:01:21,140 --> 03:01:22,280
Wait, uh...

3838
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:22,980
How are we...

3839
03:01:23,500 --> 03:01:24,720
Trying to get into...

3840
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:26,880
Uh...

3841
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:27,400
And...

3842
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:27,560
Why?

3843
03:01:27,700 --> 03:01:28,100
There we go.

3844
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:38,480
Wait, you're not on fire though, Dante.

3845
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:40,960
Look at him gooo!

3846
03:01:41,420 --> 03:01:41,680
Okay.

3847
03:01:42,500 --> 03:01:43,920
Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.

3848
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:46,180
Where's the other guy?

3849
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:46,520
Okay.

3850
03:01:49,600 --> 03:01:51,080
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3851
03:01:51,540 --> 03:01:53,740
I feel like these guys might be better with...

3852
03:01:53,740 --> 03:01:53,820
Oh.

3853
03:01:55,140 --> 03:01:55,780
Wait.

3854
03:01:57,720 --> 03:01:59,920
I wanna switch from...

3855
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:00,340
There we go.

3856
03:02:05,660 --> 03:02:07,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3857
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:07,720
Woo!

3858
03:02:12,650 --> 03:02:13,670
Oh gosh!

3859
03:02:14,790 --> 03:02:16,130
There's so many guys!

3860
03:02:16,130 --> 03:02:17,830
Just take him out, Dante!

3861
03:02:18,130 --> 03:02:19,410
Just take him out!

3862
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:20,910
Just take him out!

3863
03:02:21,390 --> 03:02:21,910
Just take him out!

3864
03:02:21,910 --> 03:02:22,330
Uh...

3865
03:02:22,330 --> 03:02:22,750
Oh gosh.

3866
03:02:22,890 --> 03:02:23,170
Oh gosh.

3867
03:02:32,590 --> 03:02:34,250
When did I switch to kick mode?

3868
03:02:34,930 --> 03:02:35,710
There we go.

3869
03:02:39,980 --> 03:02:40,380
Yeah!

3870
03:02:41,180 --> 03:02:41,620
Yeah!

3871
03:02:42,940 --> 03:02:44,500
We can't let the exit...

3872
03:02:44,500 --> 03:02:45,420
Go this time!

3873
03:02:46,340 --> 03:02:47,080
Come on!

3874
03:02:48,380 --> 03:02:49,120
There we go.

3875
03:02:51,700 --> 03:02:52,260
Okay!

3876
03:02:53,100 --> 03:02:53,660
Yeah!

3877
03:02:54,560 --> 03:02:55,100
The exit!

3878
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:55,800
Wait.

3879
03:02:58,040 --> 03:02:58,820
This one!

3880
03:03:02,120 --> 03:03:03,240
We made it!

3881
03:03:04,880 --> 03:03:06,240
I did it this time!

3882
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:07,420
Yeah!

3883
03:03:11,100 --> 03:03:13,960
Remember how Dante didn't have any patience for Agni and Rudra?

3884
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:14,620
No!

3885
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:15,800
Look at him, Mr. Chatty!

3886
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:18,800
Oh, another?

3887
03:03:20,460 --> 03:03:20,940
Ah!

3888
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:24,020
It's just like a little area to get more roars!

3889
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:26,500
I like it!

3890
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,300
Maybe the kick was better!

3891
03:03:34,220 --> 03:03:35,580
Maybe the kick was better!

3892
03:03:36,120 --> 03:03:36,160
Maybe the kick was better!

3893
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:40,040
It was better after all!

3894
03:03:42,620 --> 03:03:44,160
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

3895
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:45,080
Or...

3896
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:45,980
Oh yeah!

3897
03:03:46,180 --> 03:03:46,660
Yes it is!

3898
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:49,140
Wait!

3899
03:03:49,400 --> 03:03:49,780
This way!

3900
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:51,300
There we go!

3901
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:53,120
Wait!

3902
03:03:53,220 --> 03:03:53,400
RIP!

3903
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:53,960
LORB!

3904
03:03:54,040 --> 03:03:54,280
Wait!

3905
03:03:54,380 --> 03:03:54,780
What do you mean?

3906
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:56,820
Huh?

3907
03:03:57,640 --> 03:03:58,720
What did I miss?

3908
03:03:58,940 --> 03:03:59,540
What did I miss?

3909
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:12,060
Oh, in the timed room!

3910
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:13,400
Oh!

3911
03:04:13,880 --> 03:04:14,160
Oops!

3912
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:15,860
Oh yeah!

3913
03:04:15,940 --> 03:04:17,100
I really did miss it!

3914
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:18,100
It was in here?

3915
03:04:18,960 --> 03:04:19,640
Yeah!

3916
03:04:19,800 --> 03:04:20,300
I missed it!

3917
03:04:22,540 --> 03:04:23,220
Whoopsie!

3918
03:04:24,980 --> 03:04:25,600
Oh!

3919
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:27,520
Oh!

3920
03:04:27,880 --> 03:04:28,220
I...

3921
03:04:28,220 --> 03:04:28,600
Oops!

3922
03:04:28,600 --> 03:04:28,640
Oops!

3923
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:31,080
Oh well!

3924
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:37,440
Yeah!

3925
03:04:37,580 --> 03:04:38,260
I totally missed that!

3926
03:04:43,740 --> 03:04:44,260
Oh!

3927
03:05:07,750 --> 03:05:08,270
Oh!

3928
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:11,370
Oh!

3929
03:05:11,870 --> 03:05:11,930
Oh!

3930
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:11,970
Oh!

3931
03:05:11,970 --> 03:05:11,990
Oh!

3932
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:12,250
Big guy!

3933
03:05:24,530 --> 03:05:25,130
Yeah!

3934
03:05:29,130 --> 03:05:30,890
This thing doesn't really do much!

3935
03:05:31,090 --> 03:05:32,070
I feel it!

3936
03:05:32,290 --> 03:05:33,830
I feel he just kinda like...

3937
03:05:33,830 --> 03:05:35,090
Stands around a lot!

3938
03:05:43,880 --> 03:05:45,540
Do some dancing around!

3939
03:05:45,860 --> 03:05:46,680
Do some dancing around!

3940
03:05:47,560 --> 03:05:50,520
Do some dancing around!

3941
03:05:57,730 --> 03:05:58,330
Nice!

3942
03:05:59,370 --> 03:05:59,970
Whoa!

3943
03:06:01,350 --> 03:06:01,570
Wait!

3944
03:06:01,650 --> 03:06:02,110
Where is that?

3945
03:06:03,510 --> 03:06:03,930
Oh!

3946
03:06:04,050 --> 03:06:04,430
Right here!

3947
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:07,790
Nice!

3948
03:06:08,570 --> 03:06:09,410
LORB fragment!

3949
03:06:12,010 --> 03:06:12,710
Let's go!

3950
03:06:13,630 --> 03:06:14,590
And then I saw...

3951
03:06:16,230 --> 03:06:17,690
I did not see this...

3952
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:18,410
But I saw this!

3953
03:06:20,250 --> 03:06:20,730
Yes!

3954
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:24,830
LORB fragment!

3955
03:06:25,790 --> 03:06:26,270
Wait!

3956
03:06:26,530 --> 03:06:27,090
Where am I?

3957
03:06:27,670 --> 03:06:28,150
Oh!

3958
03:06:28,250 --> 03:06:29,390
Was this an optional room?

3959
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:33,800
Oh!

3960
03:06:34,040 --> 03:06:34,180
Wait!

3961
03:06:34,420 --> 03:06:35,880
Then this is not where I'm supposed to go!

3962
03:06:36,580 --> 03:06:37,780
So we missed a...

3963
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:38,280
Bloor fragment!

3964
03:06:38,480 --> 03:06:39,480
But we got the poor fragment!

3965
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:39,920
And said...

3966
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:40,000
Oh!

3967
03:06:40,100 --> 03:06:41,100
I'm supposed to go down this way!

3968
03:06:41,220 --> 03:06:43,180
The very obvious open hallway!

3969
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:45,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3970
03:06:45,700 --> 03:06:46,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3971
03:06:47,940 --> 03:06:48,740
Oh man!

3972
03:06:49,080 --> 03:06:50,160
They're already here!

3973
03:06:50,860 --> 03:06:52,080
These ladies work fast!

3974
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:53,820
These ladies work fast!

3975
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:55,740
Hm!

3976
03:06:57,240 --> 03:06:59,600
The very big hallway that I missed!

3977
03:07:04,500 --> 03:07:05,120
Oh!

3978
03:07:06,160 --> 03:07:07,640
Long time no see!

3979
03:07:07,960 --> 03:07:08,700
Ha ha ha ha!

3980
03:07:09,480 --> 03:07:10,420
Long time no see!

3981
03:07:13,330 --> 03:07:15,070
Ha ha ha ha!

3982
03:07:15,130 --> 03:07:26,710
Ha ha ha!

3983
03:07:27,450 --> 03:07:28,050
Oh god!

3984
03:07:28,190 --> 03:07:28,210
Oh god!

3985
03:07:28,210 --> 03:07:28,930
My game is lagging!

3986
03:07:29,330 --> 03:07:30,110
I'm gaming too hard!

3987
03:07:30,370 --> 03:07:31,350
Ha ha ha ha!

3988
03:07:31,670 --> 03:07:31,870
Woo!

3989
03:07:32,090 --> 03:07:32,210
Oh!

3990
03:07:33,010 --> 03:07:33,370
Ouch!

3991
03:07:34,330 --> 03:07:34,750
Ouch!

3992
03:07:37,540 --> 03:07:38,640
My game is lagging!

3993
03:07:38,900 --> 03:07:39,900
I'm gaming too hard!

3994
03:07:56,010 --> 03:07:57,030
I lost my momentum.

3995
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:02,900
There we go.

3996
03:08:03,100 --> 03:08:03,460
There we go.

3997
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:03,800
There we go.

3998
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:05,380
There we go.

3999
03:08:05,560 --> 03:08:05,740
Okay.

4000
03:08:06,400 --> 03:08:08,880
I was like, how do I get back to...

4001
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:19,680
There's more?

4002
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:23,480
Oh.

4003
03:08:23,620 --> 03:08:23,820
Oh.

4004
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:24,140
Oh.

4005
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:24,580
Oh.

4006
03:08:24,860 --> 03:08:25,040
Oh.

4007
03:08:25,800 --> 03:08:26,160
Oh.

4008
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:26,160
Oh.

4009
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:26,620
Oh.

4010
03:08:30,840 --> 03:08:31,480
Oh gosh.

4011
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:32,020
Oh gosh.

4012
03:08:32,220 --> 03:08:33,620
I jumped right up to him.

4013
03:08:33,620 --> 03:08:34,480
Oh, ha ha ha ha.

4014
03:08:47,570 --> 03:08:48,810
Bad ass.

4015
03:09:06,270 --> 03:09:07,030
Kabo.

4016
03:09:11,280 --> 03:09:12,680
I deserve that.

4017
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:21,000
Oh wow.

4018
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:21,940
It was one hit.

4019
03:09:27,890 --> 03:09:28,650
Uh huh.

4020
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:32,080
Cool.

4021
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:39,420
And look at that, there's a yore there right for us.

4022
03:09:45,080 --> 03:09:47,080
After...so kindly after I use my DT.

4023
03:09:48,580 --> 03:09:49,760
Get some hail.

4024
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:51,400
Nice.

4025
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:54,000
And get some money.

4026
03:09:55,180 --> 03:09:55,680
Not...oh.

4027
03:09:58,700 --> 03:09:59,380
Nice.

4028
03:09:59,380 --> 03:10:00,460
Nice.

4029
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:05,140
Ooh, what is this?

4030
03:10:09,620 --> 03:10:10,320
Oh

4031
03:10:15,150 --> 03:10:15,850
no.

4032
03:10:16,990 --> 03:10:17,370
Okay.

4033
03:10:21,820 --> 03:10:24,440
I guess it's time for the big...HELLBAT!

4034
03:10:26,220 --> 03:10:28,120
I guess it's time for the guns.

4035
03:10:30,020 --> 03:10:30,720
Okay,

4036
03:10:35,240 --> 03:10:37,960
I'm using my guns on creatures that fly.

4037
03:10:37,960 --> 03:10:38,780
Ooh!

4038
03:10:51,230 --> 03:10:52,450
DMC2 movement, yeah.

4039
03:10:53,270 --> 03:10:53,830
That's okay.

4040
03:11:08,010 --> 03:11:08,430
Nice.

4041
03:11:09,870 --> 03:11:10,710
Wait, where are you?

4042
03:11:10,930 --> 03:11:11,010
Oh.

4043
03:11:19,630 --> 03:11:21,150
Did I get rid of the other bat already?

4044
03:11:23,250 --> 03:11:24,610
Oh god, she's so stupid.

4045
03:11:25,530 --> 03:11:26,750
This guy is so stupid.

4046
03:11:26,990 --> 03:11:27,390
So dumb.

4047
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:34,440
Oh wait, I'm not in.

4048
03:11:39,390 --> 03:11:39,990
Uh...

4049
03:11:39,990 --> 03:11:40,730
Oh shoot!

4050
03:11:40,990 --> 03:11:41,670
Oh shoot!

4051
03:11:41,990 --> 03:11:42,590
Oh shoot!

4052
03:11:42,990 --> 03:11:45,170
Okay, they're actually...they're active now.

4053
03:11:45,490 --> 03:11:46,050
Oh god.

4054
03:11:46,310 --> 03:11:47,090
Oh god!

4055
03:11:47,390 --> 03:11:47,710
Okay.

4056
03:11:48,090 --> 03:11:49,650
They actually do something now.

4057
03:11:51,210 --> 03:11:52,510
I got too comfy.

4058
03:11:53,030 --> 03:11:53,710
Oh my god.

4059
03:11:53,910 --> 03:11:54,570
Oh my god.

4060
03:11:55,230 --> 03:11:55,710
You know what?

4061
03:11:55,750 --> 03:11:56,110
Screw you.

4062
03:12:07,380 --> 03:12:08,320
Oh my gosh.

4063
03:12:08,500 --> 03:12:10,460
I'm not good at dodging these at all.

4064
03:12:10,560 --> 03:12:11,120
Dodge!

4065
03:12:12,080 --> 03:12:12,640
Dodge!

4066
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:13,900
Dodge!

4067
03:12:13,900 --> 03:12:13,940
Dodge!

4068
03:12:14,300 --> 03:12:14,900
Oh my god.

4069
03:12:16,300 --> 03:12:16,860
Oh!

4070
03:12:21,260 --> 03:12:22,100
I can't DT!

4071
03:12:22,840 --> 03:12:23,300
Oh no!

4072
03:12:27,100 --> 03:12:28,700
It's in aggro mode.

4073
03:12:28,980 --> 03:12:29,920
Oh my gosh.

4074
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:43,300
Oh!

4075
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:44,180
Oh!

4076
03:12:44,720 --> 03:12:45,000
Oh!

4077
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:45,700
Am I dying here?

4078
03:12:45,840 --> 03:12:46,860
Oh god, it'll be so bad.

4079
03:12:54,390 --> 03:12:55,210
Last resort.

4080
03:12:55,890 --> 03:12:56,390
This distance.

4081
03:12:56,670 --> 03:12:57,470
While I...

4082
03:12:57,470 --> 03:12:58,270
Get my DT?

4083
03:12:58,450 --> 03:12:58,630
Help!

4084
03:12:59,530 --> 03:13:00,010
Ah!

4085
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:04,440
She didn't hear me talking.

4086
03:13:05,660 --> 03:13:07,360
How many gorbs do I have?

4087
03:13:07,640 --> 03:13:08,700
Oh, I have 11.

4088
03:13:13,730 --> 03:13:15,010
Nah, I'll just redo it.

4089
03:13:15,130 --> 03:13:15,250
Wait.

4090
03:13:15,510 --> 03:13:16,990
How long ago was it?

4091
03:13:18,530 --> 03:13:20,870
How long ago was the checkboy, I wonder?

4092
03:13:23,050 --> 03:13:25,210
Get called stupid and it locked in.

4093
03:13:25,490 --> 03:13:27,170
Yeah, I got karma for real.

4094
03:13:28,950 --> 03:13:30,790
I got karma for real.

4095
03:13:32,730 --> 03:13:33,970
Not far back.

4096
03:13:34,310 --> 03:13:34,430
Wait.

4097
03:13:35,270 --> 03:13:36,050
Last fight.

4098
03:13:41,140 --> 03:13:42,780
Probably right before the fight.

4099
03:13:43,100 --> 03:13:43,660
Let's try it then.

4100
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:47,520
I'm old.

4101
03:13:48,840 --> 03:13:49,980
Yeah, you are.

4102
03:13:52,940 --> 03:13:55,200
The last judgment draweth not.

4103
03:13:55,680 --> 03:13:56,480
Okay, checkpoint.

4104
03:13:56,640 --> 03:13:57,020
Let's see.

4105
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:00,360
Blants!

4106
03:14:01,820 --> 03:14:02,700
Oh, whoa, whoa.

4107
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:04,360
Oh, yeah.

4108
03:14:04,620 --> 03:14:04,960
Yeah, yeah.

4109
03:14:05,080 --> 03:14:05,580
It was right before.

4110
03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:06,540
Very nice.

4111
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:06,880
Hold on.

4112
03:14:06,940 --> 03:14:07,520
I need more water.

4113
03:14:17,280 --> 03:14:17,760
Okay.

4114
03:14:24,410 --> 03:14:24,890
Bats.

4115
03:14:25,930 --> 03:14:27,010
Fucking love bats.

4116
03:14:38,970 --> 03:14:39,530
No.

4117
03:14:53,700 --> 03:14:54,700
Come here, please.

4118
03:14:55,380 --> 03:14:55,900
Oh, there we go.

4119
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:02,240
Get them with stinger.

4120
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:07,760
Yeah!

4121
03:15:11,740 --> 03:15:12,520
Oh, God!

4122
03:15:12,820 --> 03:15:13,060
Oh!

4123
03:15:13,300 --> 03:15:14,240
He's gonna explode!

4124
03:15:27,230 --> 03:15:27,790
Nice.

4125
03:15:29,750 --> 03:15:30,870
Where'd the other guy go?

4126
03:15:31,030 --> 03:15:31,530
Oh, there he goes.

4127
03:15:35,750 --> 03:15:36,110
Yeah.

4128
03:15:36,410 --> 03:15:37,050
That's right.

4129
03:15:38,150 --> 03:15:38,710
Alright.

4130
03:15:40,770 --> 03:15:42,990
Now we get these guys in.

4131
03:15:50,270 --> 03:15:53,590
Oh, I think it sees me killing its babies, maybe.

4132
03:15:54,510 --> 03:15:54,570
And

4133
03:16:02,080 --> 03:16:02,660
that's...

4134
03:16:02,660 --> 03:16:04,340
Yeah, I'm sick because I...

4135
03:16:04,340 --> 03:16:05,420
Ate your baby.

4136
03:16:07,040 --> 03:16:07,680
Oh, oh, oh.

4137
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:08,420
Oh, my God.

4138
03:16:08,680 --> 03:16:08,920
CC!

4139
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:10,640
Okay,

4140
03:16:23,420 --> 03:16:25,320
we kind of got it in a stun lock right now.

4141
03:16:28,780 --> 03:16:29,980
I don't know how long...

4142
03:16:29,980 --> 03:16:31,820
How much longer that will last, so...

4143
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,400
Wait, it's not being so aggro this time, though.

4144
03:16:38,260 --> 03:16:38,780
What?

4145
03:16:39,740 --> 03:16:41,440
It's not even this aggro anymore.

4146
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:43,060
What?

4147
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:50,500
Because it didn't get blood.

4148
03:16:52,020 --> 03:16:53,160
Yeah, it wasn't...

4149
03:16:53,160 --> 03:16:53,680
It was...

4150
03:16:53,680 --> 03:16:54,700
It didn't drink blood.

4151
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:56,240
Oh,

4152
03:17:00,370 --> 03:17:01,470
I think I missed the door.

4153
03:17:03,290 --> 03:17:04,370
It was like right there.

4154
03:17:04,510 --> 03:17:05,870
I saw it open while I was fighting.

4155
03:17:06,790 --> 03:17:07,070
Oh, well.

4156
03:17:08,530 --> 03:17:11,070
The queen gets stronger by drinking the blood of dead enemies.

4157
03:17:11,790 --> 03:17:14,250
Oh, see, I thought it was upset that I killed its babies.

4158
03:17:15,070 --> 03:17:15,890
Of course, she doesn't care.

4159
03:17:22,700 --> 03:17:23,720
I thought it was a birthday.

4160
03:17:25,900 --> 03:17:27,000
Nice to see you.

4161
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:28,160
Enjoying my favorite franchise.

4162
03:17:28,320 --> 03:17:28,980
Also, today is my birthday.

4163
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:29,820
Diego!

4164
03:17:30,400 --> 03:17:31,160
Happy birthday!

4165
03:17:32,320 --> 03:17:33,740
Thank you for the super job.

4166
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:35,080
Happy, happy, happy birthday.

4167
03:17:46,530 --> 03:17:47,910
Sorry, I've never come...

4168
03:17:47,910 --> 03:17:49,510
Trying to drink more water recently.

4169
03:17:51,070 --> 03:17:52,770
I've been like waking up and my...

4170
03:17:53,850 --> 03:17:56,550
Throat is not hurting, but it's so dry.

4171
03:17:57,930 --> 03:17:58,490
Oh.

4172
03:17:58,910 --> 03:17:59,350
Oh.

4173
03:18:01,330 --> 03:18:01,890
Oh.

4174
03:18:03,370 --> 03:18:03,930
Um.

4175
03:18:04,710 --> 03:18:05,170
Okay.

4176
03:18:06,030 --> 03:18:07,150
Timed platforming.

4177
03:18:07,250 --> 03:18:08,070
We love to see it.

4178
03:18:15,010 --> 03:18:16,030
Oh, oops.

4179
03:18:16,310 --> 03:18:16,890
Oh, okay.

4180
03:18:17,110 --> 03:18:17,830
Alright, hold on.

4181
03:18:25,780 --> 03:18:26,960
He's so strong!

4182
03:18:27,780 --> 03:18:29,340
Wait, where am I supposed to go then?

4183
03:18:32,080 --> 03:18:33,200
That way...

4184
03:18:39,590 --> 03:18:42,230
Sometimes the environment is a little...

4185
03:18:42,230 --> 03:18:42,810
Uh...

4186
03:18:42,810 --> 03:18:43,770
Everywhere is so ugly.

4187
03:18:44,130 --> 03:18:46,750
It's hard to tell which ugly place we gotta go to.

4188
03:18:48,830 --> 03:18:49,970
Oh, wow!

4189
03:18:50,910 --> 03:18:52,110
They're gonna do that.

4190
03:18:52,590 --> 03:18:52,750
Okay.

4191
03:18:56,970 --> 03:18:58,410
Say hi, Droid and Minto.

4192
03:18:58,670 --> 03:18:59,470
You guys too!

4193
03:19:00,770 --> 03:19:01,850
You guys too.

4194
03:19:02,290 --> 03:19:03,470
Let's see how long does it take.

4195
03:19:05,690 --> 03:19:06,210
Oh...

4196
03:19:06,210 --> 03:19:07,910
Oh, they look so sad.

4197
03:19:15,940 --> 03:19:16,460
Okay.

4198
03:19:16,760 --> 03:19:18,240
This is our checkpoint, I believe.

4199
03:19:18,240 --> 03:19:18,500
Yep.

4200
03:19:19,080 --> 03:19:19,800
Nothing here though.

4201
03:19:23,800 --> 03:19:24,360
Wait...

4202
03:19:24,360 --> 03:19:25,760
I see the GORB!

4203
03:19:34,390 --> 03:19:34,950
Nice.

4204
03:19:37,650 --> 03:19:37,930
Nice.

4205
03:19:40,650 --> 03:19:41,950
Is that the way I needed to go?

4206
03:19:42,450 --> 03:19:44,010
That didn't look like it.

4207
03:19:45,370 --> 03:19:46,850
I thought it was literally...

4208
03:19:46,850 --> 03:19:47,910
That's why I called it a...

4209
03:19:50,470 --> 03:19:51,690
Oh, it really is.

4210
03:19:52,730 --> 03:19:54,710
I called it a halfway point because...

4211
03:19:54,710 --> 03:19:55,930
I thought I needed to go to the right.

4212
03:19:58,150 --> 03:19:59,030
So silly.

4213
03:20:01,530 --> 03:20:03,390
I can feel them.

4214
03:20:04,370 --> 03:20:05,150
Who's coming?

4215
03:20:05,430 --> 03:20:05,810
Here.

4216
03:20:07,130 --> 03:20:08,070
There they are.

4217
03:20:08,930 --> 03:20:09,530
Whoa.

4218
03:20:10,010 --> 03:20:10,610
Whoa.

4219
03:20:11,070 --> 03:20:11,670
Whoa.

4220
03:20:11,810 --> 03:20:13,030
It turned into like an arena.

4221
03:20:13,690 --> 03:20:14,410
That's crazy.

4222
03:20:14,770 --> 03:20:16,430
Oh my golly.

4223
03:20:17,270 --> 03:20:17,870
Okay.

4224
03:20:19,390 --> 03:20:19,990
Um...

4225
03:20:19,990 --> 03:20:20,670
Oh my gosh.

4226
03:20:20,830 --> 03:20:22,910
It's just like fighting these guys all over again.

4227
03:20:23,730 --> 03:20:25,530
And then they all come after me.

4228
03:20:25,830 --> 03:20:26,670
One at a time.

4229
03:20:40,170 --> 03:20:40,770
Ouch.

4230
03:20:44,090 --> 03:20:44,690
Holy.

4231
03:20:48,510 --> 03:20:49,130
Damn.

4232
03:20:53,030 --> 03:20:53,870
Damn it.

4233
03:20:54,170 --> 03:20:54,370
Damn it.

4234
03:20:56,250 --> 03:20:56,970
Damn.

4235
03:21:00,320 --> 03:21:01,560
Stop.

4236
03:21:02,920 --> 03:21:04,820
Stop blocking me.

4237
03:21:06,620 --> 03:21:08,760
The way they all line up is too cute.

4238
03:21:35,830 --> 03:21:36,430
Damn.

4239
03:21:37,110 --> 03:21:38,410
I should have parried that.

4240
03:21:39,870 --> 03:21:40,290
Oh.

4241
03:21:40,450 --> 03:21:40,930
Please.

4242
03:21:41,170 --> 03:21:41,850
Please do anything.

4243
03:21:51,410 --> 03:21:52,010
Damn.

4244
03:21:52,890 --> 03:21:53,370
Damn.

4245
03:21:55,870 --> 03:21:57,410
Yeah, so much for that, huh?

4246
03:21:59,570 --> 03:22:00,510
What's the matter?

4247
03:22:00,810 --> 03:22:01,710
What's the matter?

4248
03:22:05,630 --> 03:22:06,510
Oh my god.

4249
03:22:06,650 --> 03:22:08,170
Wait, is that the bros he throws?

4250
03:22:08,750 --> 03:22:09,170
Wait.

4251
03:22:12,750 --> 03:22:14,150
And we were all satisfied.

4252
03:22:15,470 --> 03:22:15,570
Oh.

4253
03:22:15,830 --> 03:22:16,750
He tried to dodge that.

4254
03:22:18,190 --> 03:22:18,610
Oh.

4255
03:22:18,850 --> 03:22:19,170
Damn.

4256
03:22:30,760 --> 03:22:35,100
I should probably try taking like one guy out.

4257
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:36,300
Like that, you know.

4258
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:43,040
First I whip it out.

4259
03:22:43,320 --> 03:22:44,660
Then I thrust him.

4260
03:22:55,930 --> 03:22:57,430
I won't let you.

4261
03:23:00,670 --> 03:23:03,410
I tried to, I tried to get that guy.

4262
03:23:07,480 --> 03:23:08,820
I got another guy though.

4263
03:23:13,260 --> 03:23:13,860
Yeah.

4264
03:23:14,460 --> 03:23:14,680
Okay.

4265
03:23:15,240 --> 03:23:16,040
They're falling.

4266
03:23:16,340 --> 03:23:17,340
Slowly but surely.

4267
03:23:22,320 --> 03:23:23,820
I'm gonna DT the hill.

4268
03:23:23,820 --> 03:23:23,880
I'm gonna DT the hill.

4269
03:23:27,860 --> 03:23:28,200
Teeheeheehee.

4270
03:23:28,540 --> 03:23:29,020
Teeheehee.

4271
03:23:29,020 --> 03:23:29,280
Teeheehee.

4272
03:23:29,500 --> 03:23:30,160
Teeheeheehee.

4273
03:23:44,900 --> 03:23:51,510
I'm not even finishing it.

4274
03:23:51,710 --> 03:23:52,270
Come on.

4275
03:23:56,410 --> 03:23:58,410
Wait, why isn't it working now?

4276
03:23:58,730 --> 03:23:59,590
Is it on a timer?

4277
03:24:01,050 --> 03:24:02,010
That's lame.

4278
03:24:03,450 --> 03:24:04,090
Oh!

4279
03:24:07,720 --> 03:24:09,380
I made him angry here.

4280
03:24:09,640 --> 03:24:10,560
My bad.

4281
03:24:17,330 --> 03:24:22,790
My hand is like accidentally... switching it up.

4282
03:24:24,430 --> 03:24:26,210
Come here, you're so fast now.

4283
03:24:26,870 --> 03:24:27,630
No, stop!

4284
03:24:27,990 --> 03:24:28,790
Stop backing up!

4285
03:24:30,190 --> 03:24:32,510
Stop playing like you're a real person.

4286
03:24:32,730 --> 03:24:33,790
It's freaking me out.

4287
03:24:35,630 --> 03:24:36,970
Here, I'll dance on you.

4288
03:24:37,350 --> 03:24:38,470
I'm styling on you.

4289
03:24:38,690 --> 03:24:38,950
Woop!

4290
03:24:44,810 --> 03:24:46,310
I want to go back to punching.

4291
03:24:48,150 --> 03:24:49,150
Oh, damn.

4292
03:24:49,930 --> 03:24:50,590
So there we go.

4293
03:24:50,730 --> 03:24:51,150
So there we go.

4294
03:24:56,810 --> 03:24:57,770
Holy cow!

4295
03:25:00,210 --> 03:25:00,890
Please!

4296
03:25:01,630 --> 03:25:02,690
Let me hit you!

4297
03:25:05,170 --> 03:25:06,190
There we go.

4298
03:25:06,310 --> 03:25:06,870
My goodness.

4299
03:25:09,230 --> 03:25:11,210
Good thing I won one at a time.

4300
03:25:19,320 --> 03:25:20,000
Okay.

4301
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:22,140
Get her.

4302
03:25:22,580 --> 03:25:23,060
Thank you.

4303
03:25:24,020 --> 03:25:24,360
Yes.

4304
03:25:24,720 --> 03:25:25,340
Yes.

4305
03:25:25,500 --> 03:25:26,480
Yes, I understand.

4306
03:25:42,030 --> 03:25:43,250
50,000.

4307
03:26:05,630 --> 03:26:09,430
In the boss fight, go all the way to the left in the arena and you'll get a secret weapon.

4308
03:26:09,690 --> 03:26:09,810
Oh!

4309
03:26:10,550 --> 03:26:11,390
Thank you.

4310
03:26:13,250 --> 03:26:14,090
Swordmaster upgrade.

4311
03:26:14,330 --> 03:26:16,690
Since I'm pretty much exclusively...

4312
03:26:17,850 --> 03:26:18,970
Exclusively using it.

4313
03:26:19,030 --> 03:26:19,890
Yeah, maybe, right?

4314
03:26:22,290 --> 03:26:23,050
Oh, no, no, no.

4315
03:26:23,110 --> 03:26:23,890
I don't need to try it.

4316
03:26:24,150 --> 03:26:24,310
Learn.

4317
03:26:27,310 --> 03:26:28,190
Let's try it.

4318
03:26:28,310 --> 03:26:28,870
Or let's...

4319
03:26:28,870 --> 03:26:30,110
Let's go...

4320
03:26:30,110 --> 03:26:32,130
Let's try the boss and see what happens.

4321
03:26:36,310 --> 03:26:37,310
Oh, thank goodness.

4322
03:26:38,270 --> 03:26:38,930
Oh, thank goodness.

4323
03:26:38,930 --> 03:26:39,190
Oh, my goodness.

4324
03:26:39,350 --> 03:26:39,770
Thank you.

4325
03:26:40,290 --> 03:26:41,110
Game is so kind.

4326
03:26:42,730 --> 03:26:45,220
This game is so much kinder than all the others.

4327
03:26:46,370 --> 03:26:48,790
Except watch this boss fight be like horrible.

4328
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:49,250
Oh, wait.

4329
03:26:49,250 --> 03:26:49,730
Oh, yeah.

4330
03:26:50,510 --> 03:26:51,510
I'm feeling it.

4331
03:26:52,110 --> 03:26:52,710
It's him.

4332
03:26:53,210 --> 03:26:54,590
I was gonna say, why...

4333
03:26:54,590 --> 03:26:54,930
Oh, wait.

4334
03:26:55,050 --> 03:26:56,110
It's just this guy again.

4335
03:26:56,450 --> 03:26:57,010
I can't...

4336
03:26:57,010 --> 03:27:00,590
All these stinking nasty pathways look all the same.

4337
03:27:00,810 --> 03:27:01,710
It's just this dude.

4338
03:27:02,190 --> 03:27:03,010
It's urine.

4339
03:27:10,450 --> 03:27:12,950
Yeah, I know it's a flashback, but I forgot.

4340
03:27:16,910 --> 03:27:20,130
For some reason, I was just like, yeah, we're just gonna go fight another guy.

4341
03:27:20,130 --> 03:27:20,650
I don't know.

4342
03:27:21,310 --> 03:27:23,690
Oh, king of stench and filth.

4343
03:27:25,070 --> 03:27:25,950
I'm impressed.

4344
03:27:26,930 --> 03:27:29,190
Those are two of the most badass women in the world.

4345
03:27:29,190 --> 03:27:30,470
So this is right before...

4346
03:27:30,470 --> 03:27:31,390
At the very beginning...

4347
03:27:32,650 --> 03:27:34,770
This is right before Nero came in.

4348
03:27:35,370 --> 03:27:36,430
When V...

4349
03:27:37,070 --> 03:27:38,210
Brought him back...

4350
03:27:38,210 --> 03:27:38,750
Brought him over.

4351
03:27:40,310 --> 03:27:41,730
King of stinky and filth.

4352
03:27:41,770 --> 03:27:42,630
Sounds just like me.

4353
03:27:56,700 --> 03:27:57,740
Oh, gosh.

4354
03:27:57,940 --> 03:27:58,120
Okay.

4355
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:00,540
Don't.

4356
03:28:01,240 --> 03:28:01,680
All right.

4357
03:28:01,860 --> 03:28:03,320
All the way to the left, y'all, sir?

4358
03:28:07,270 --> 03:28:07,790
Oh, what?

4359
03:28:07,910 --> 03:28:08,010
Oh.

4360
03:28:09,910 --> 03:28:10,270
Oh.

4361
03:28:10,510 --> 03:28:11,310
I should pay attention.

4362
03:28:13,490 --> 03:28:14,030
Can I...

4363
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:14,670
How do I grab it?

4364
03:28:15,550 --> 03:28:15,990
Oh-ho!

4365
03:28:18,790 --> 03:28:19,510
Kalina Ann.

4366
03:28:20,530 --> 03:28:21,190
Oh, come on.

4367
03:28:21,230 --> 03:28:21,810
That was dirty.

4368
03:28:22,110 --> 03:28:22,930
That was so dirty.

4369
03:28:23,030 --> 03:28:23,770
This is so dirty.

4370
03:28:24,370 --> 03:28:25,990
I'm getting sun-locked.

4371
03:28:29,090 --> 03:28:30,290
I'm getting sun-locked.

4372
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:46,100
Why does he feel...

4373
03:28:46,100 --> 03:28:46,440
Oh my god.

4374
03:28:47,160 --> 03:28:48,100
He feels...

4375
03:28:48,100 --> 03:28:48,280
Ah!

4376
03:28:49,760 --> 03:28:51,000
He feels more...

4377
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:52,620
aggressive.

4378
03:28:53,140 --> 03:28:55,560
Than when I played with him with Nero.

4379
03:29:01,670 --> 03:29:04,210
Maybe Dante really did slow him down a little bit.

4380
03:29:09,830 --> 03:29:10,550
Oh!

4381
03:29:11,090 --> 03:29:11,450
Oh!

4382
03:29:13,480 --> 03:29:15,100
Our baby boy is here.

4383
03:29:21,820 --> 03:29:22,700
That's it?

4384
03:29:26,910 --> 03:29:28,450
That was it for mission 10?

4385
03:29:31,170 --> 03:29:32,490
See, yeah.

4386
03:29:32,790 --> 03:29:33,490
11-11.

4387
03:29:35,990 --> 03:29:37,430
June 15th.

4388
03:29:37,430 --> 03:29:38,930
You know the rest.

4389
03:29:39,050 --> 03:29:39,890
Yeah, we know the rest.

4390
03:29:39,890 --> 03:29:40,590
My last hope, Nero...

4391
03:29:43,990 --> 03:29:45,490
Was completely useless.

4392
03:29:47,710 --> 03:29:48,190
Hahaha.

4393
03:29:50,090 --> 03:29:51,510
Get Nero out of here!

4394
03:29:51,670 --> 03:29:52,650
This was a bad move!

4395
03:29:52,910 --> 03:29:53,610
Nero, no!

4396
03:29:53,870 --> 03:29:54,950
You're just dead weight!

4397
03:29:56,770 --> 03:29:57,250
No.

4398
03:29:58,930 --> 03:29:59,410
Yeah.

4399
03:29:59,850 --> 03:30:01,070
That bastard call me dead weight!

4400
03:30:01,310 --> 03:30:03,050
I didn't come all this way for nothing!

4401
03:30:04,490 --> 03:30:04,970
Yeah...

4402
03:30:05,650 --> 03:30:06,130
Yeah...

4403
03:30:06,130 --> 03:30:06,410
Hahaha.

4404
03:30:16,680 --> 03:30:17,600
Rebellion!

4405
03:30:29,740 --> 03:30:30,800
It's so painful.

4406
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:35,500
It's like watching MSF be destroyed in Ground Zeroes.

4407
03:30:35,600 --> 03:30:35,920
Hahaha.

4408
03:30:36,700 --> 03:30:37,620
You're like, no!

4409
03:30:38,860 --> 03:30:39,780
Up!

4410
03:30:44,320 --> 03:30:45,240
No!

4411
03:30:47,620 --> 03:30:48,540
Yeah!

4412
03:30:54,300 --> 03:30:55,220
Hahaha.

4413
03:30:55,220 --> 03:30:55,420
Hahaha.

4414
03:30:56,960 --> 03:30:57,760
It's okay, Trish.

4415
03:30:57,880 --> 03:30:58,540
You did your best.

4416
03:31:00,800 --> 03:31:02,000
Wait, what did he just...

4417
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:02,920
What did he just rip out?

4418
03:31:12,850 --> 03:31:16,870
The Devil Sword Sparta no longer serves a purpose.

4419
03:31:18,230 --> 03:31:21,490
I have plans for the both of you.

4420
03:31:21,510 --> 03:31:21,790
Eww!

4421
03:31:26,850 --> 03:31:27,410
Eww!

4422
03:31:28,230 --> 03:31:30,480
How fortunate to serve such...

4423
03:31:32,030 --> 03:31:33,190
Divine purpose.

4424
03:31:42,220 --> 03:31:42,800
Alright.

4425
03:31:43,060 --> 03:31:43,880
I don't think I like that.

4426
03:31:44,120 --> 03:31:44,460
Enough's enough.

4427
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:46,320
Can't let a boy...

4428
03:31:47,620 --> 03:31:49,040
Do a man's job.

4429
03:31:49,440 --> 03:31:50,560
Hey, wait.

4430
03:31:51,240 --> 03:31:52,760
I'm not done talking yet.

4431
03:31:53,700 --> 03:31:54,640
Oh gosh.

4432
03:31:55,180 --> 03:31:56,440
How much time is...

4433
03:31:56,440 --> 03:31:56,520
Is V okay?

4434
03:31:57,900 --> 03:31:58,480
Yeah.

4435
03:31:59,180 --> 03:32:00,440
By the way...

4436
03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:02,260
I guess I owe you one.

4437
03:32:02,400 --> 03:32:03,100
Is V okay?

4438
03:32:04,860 --> 03:32:06,120
Our sick guy...

4439
03:32:06,120 --> 03:32:06,380
Oh!

4440
03:32:07,640 --> 03:32:08,620
Is he literally...

4441
03:32:08,620 --> 03:32:09,800
He's getting Thanos'd?

4442
03:32:10,160 --> 03:32:11,460
Devil Sword Sparta.

4443
03:32:11,900 --> 03:32:14,100
Well, I guess we don't have Rebellion anymore, so...

4444
03:32:15,420 --> 03:32:15,940
No!

4445
03:32:19,840 --> 03:32:20,360
Wait...

4446
03:32:20,360 --> 03:32:20,800
Oh gosh.

4447
03:32:22,900 --> 03:32:24,640
Oh, we kept Lady's Gun too.

4448
03:32:24,640 --> 03:32:25,240
That's great.

4449
03:32:26,700 --> 03:32:31,220
Wait, so all my abilities that I learned with Rebellion that I paid for just now...

4450
03:32:32,600 --> 03:32:34,100
Oh, we kept Stinger!

4451
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:35,100
Okay, okay.

4452
03:32:36,540 --> 03:32:37,300
You know what?

4453
03:32:37,320 --> 03:32:38,140
I'll learn Stinger too.

4454
03:32:38,280 --> 03:32:39,280
I use Stinger enough.

4455
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:41,340
You keep him.

4456
03:32:41,440 --> 03:32:41,920
Thank goodness.

4457
03:32:45,360 --> 03:32:46,840
Dreads versus Sparta.

4458
03:32:48,220 --> 03:32:49,960
I just wanna start the...

4459
03:32:49,960 --> 03:32:51,180
I just wanna see what's going on.

4460
03:32:51,620 --> 03:32:51,820
Let's see.

4461
03:32:53,720 --> 03:32:54,240
Dante!

4462
03:32:54,240 --> 03:32:54,460
Okay.

4463
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:00,700
Woohoo!

4464
03:33:01,640 --> 03:33:02,340
Alright.

4465
03:33:04,880 --> 03:33:06,600
Everything is so...

4466
03:33:08,240 --> 03:33:09,080
Ashy.

4467
03:33:11,680 --> 03:33:13,860
Looks like I overslept.

4468
03:33:14,140 --> 03:33:17,500
Time for a warmup, baby.

4469
03:33:18,220 --> 03:33:18,940
Maybe...

4470
03:33:19,500 --> 03:33:20,440
Oh, okay.

4471
03:33:22,340 --> 03:33:23,420
Oh my goodness!

4472
03:33:28,340 --> 03:33:29,060
Yeah!

4473
03:33:29,620 --> 03:33:30,140
Yeah!

4474
03:33:30,520 --> 03:33:30,980
Oh.

4475
03:33:35,220 --> 03:33:36,460
Oh, you too!

4476
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:47,720
Oh!

4477
03:33:56,290 --> 03:33:57,310
Oh, shoot.

4478
03:34:04,690 --> 03:34:05,410
Nice!

4479
03:34:05,890 --> 03:34:07,310
I think there was one guy over here, no?

4480
03:34:08,270 --> 03:34:08,790
No?

4481
03:34:08,990 --> 03:34:09,570
Just this thing?

4482
03:34:14,110 --> 03:34:15,450
Just this thing?

4483
03:34:26,510 --> 03:34:28,530
I feel like we're in easy mode now.

4484
03:34:29,590 --> 03:34:30,770
It's so powerful!

4485
03:34:30,930 --> 03:34:32,290
We took care of that guy so fast!

4486
03:34:38,940 --> 03:34:39,460
Alright.

4487
03:34:42,140 --> 03:34:42,980
Um...

4488
03:34:42,980 --> 03:34:45,380
I'm guessing we just make our way up.

4489
03:34:46,760 --> 03:34:48,360
Making our way up town!

4490
03:34:49,140 --> 03:34:50,340
Walking fast!

4491
03:34:52,880 --> 03:34:54,700
Destroying graves is fun!

4492
03:34:56,500 --> 03:34:59,440
I'm suddenly back to...

4493
03:34:59,440 --> 03:35:00,520
Uh...

4494
03:35:00,520 --> 03:35:01,300
Back to...

4495
03:35:02,580 --> 03:35:04,260
Tomato town!

4496
03:35:04,260 --> 03:35:04,380
Oh my god!

4497
03:35:08,760 --> 03:35:09,640
Let's go...

4498
03:35:09,640 --> 03:35:18,920
I don't think there's a way for me to get up there just yet.

4499
03:35:19,200 --> 03:35:19,280
What?

4500
03:35:20,320 --> 03:35:20,760
Unlieued?

4501
03:35:21,500 --> 03:35:22,600
I did not lie.

4502
03:35:22,600 --> 03:35:24,280
I never lie.

4503
03:35:30,280 --> 03:35:31,600
Oh, keep going.

4504
03:35:32,100 --> 03:35:32,480
There we go.

4505
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:36,340
It's a middle ground.

4506
03:35:55,800 --> 03:35:58,640
Making sure I don't miss anything.

4507
03:35:59,020 --> 03:36:01,000
I was so blind to that blurb before.

4508
03:36:01,720 --> 03:36:04,080
I was blind to the blurb.

4509
03:36:06,720 --> 03:36:09,100
They love sending these guys out.

4510
03:36:16,320 --> 03:36:18,320
They're just waiting for him to die.

4511
03:36:34,520 --> 03:36:36,100
You trying to attack me?

4512
03:36:36,460 --> 03:36:37,820
You trying to get a move in?

4513
03:36:45,140 --> 03:36:46,120
What is this?

4514
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:48,640
We're

4515
03:36:54,800 --> 03:36:55,160
on fire!

4516
03:36:55,320 --> 03:36:55,620
We're on fire!

4517
03:36:59,920 --> 03:37:02,160
You trying to attack me?

4518
03:37:03,280 --> 03:37:04,620
You trying to attack me?

4519
03:37:05,980 --> 03:37:07,420
You trying to attack me?

4520
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:10,500
You trying to attack me?

4521
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:11,220
You trying to attack me?

4522
03:37:14,180 --> 03:37:15,200
What's the S time?

4523
03:37:15,440 --> 03:37:16,260
Oh yeah, let's see.

4524
03:37:18,040 --> 03:37:19,300
Wait, can I still do it?

4525
03:37:19,400 --> 03:37:20,220
Even if not in battle?

4526
03:37:20,440 --> 03:37:20,660
Let's see.

4527
03:37:21,260 --> 03:37:22,740
The stun is too good.

4528
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:28,680
Yeah!

4529
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:38,100
Looks like you just had your ass handed to you.

4530
03:37:46,280 --> 03:37:47,020
Okay, Dante.

4531
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:52,100
He's a little party.

4532
03:37:57,880 --> 03:37:59,360
Come on, come on!

4533
03:38:02,400 --> 03:38:03,540
I didn't need to jump.

4534
03:38:04,140 --> 03:38:05,700
There we go, nice.

4535
03:38:09,440 --> 03:38:11,780
There's another secret weapon in this area.

4536
03:38:13,420 --> 03:38:14,480
In this area?

4537
03:38:15,860 --> 03:38:18,440
Like, well, I don't mean just down here, but I'm looking around.

4538
03:38:20,840 --> 03:38:22,400
I'm taking a little gander.

4539
03:38:25,840 --> 03:38:27,340
Oh, I already got it.

4540
03:38:30,160 --> 03:38:30,720
Oh!

4541
03:38:32,740 --> 03:38:33,520
Lady's weapon?

4542
03:38:38,780 --> 03:38:39,720
You get two.

4543
03:38:42,520 --> 03:38:45,460
You technically skipped it since you picked up Kalina Ann early.

4544
03:38:45,600 --> 03:38:46,620
Ah, okay, okay.

4545
03:38:51,500 --> 03:38:52,860
So I won't worry about it.

4546
03:38:52,860 --> 03:38:53,480
Thank you, though.

4547
03:38:55,400 --> 03:38:56,420
Thank you, thank you.

4548
03:38:57,900 --> 03:39:01,540
Everyone was so quick to be like, no!

4549
03:39:02,720 --> 03:39:04,380
Don't look for it!

4550
03:39:04,700 --> 03:39:06,540
You already got it!

4551
03:39:07,400 --> 03:39:08,920
You guys are so fast.

4552
03:39:10,060 --> 03:39:10,460
The naknowing has two roboters.

4553
03:39:10,460 --> 03:39:10,900
Oh, there it is.

4554
03:39:10,960 --> 03:39:12,100
No little pain in the ass.

4555
03:39:12,900 --> 03:39:14,040
Just gotta take it down.

4556
03:39:15,820 --> 03:39:16,220
Ahemala!

4557
03:39:16,360 --> 03:39:16,920
Come here!

4558
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:17,420
Come here!

4559
03:39:17,540 --> 03:39:18,100
Come here!

4560
03:39:18,660 --> 03:39:18,860
Come here!

4561
03:39:20,100 --> 03:39:20,900
Come here!

4562
03:39:22,300 --> 03:39:23,100
Come here!

4563
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:25,200
There we

4564
03:39:28,390 --> 03:39:28,590
go.

4565
03:39:29,130 --> 03:39:30,170
Just gotta take it down.

4566
03:39:30,950 --> 03:39:31,390
Oh.

4567
03:39:33,250 --> 03:39:34,330
Wait, who else is here?

4568
03:39:35,410 --> 03:39:36,070
No one?

4569
03:39:36,230 --> 03:39:36,450
Okay.

4570
03:39:42,170 --> 03:39:44,250
I like how it just feels like...

4571
03:39:44,830 --> 03:39:45,930
This is not Beowulf.

4572
03:39:45,970 --> 03:39:46,590
I almost said Beowulf.

4573
03:39:46,770 --> 03:39:49,290
Balrog just knows how to talk... or how to count.

4574
03:39:49,990 --> 03:39:51,270
And we're in Sesame Street.

4575
03:40:00,820 --> 03:40:01,460
Oh, God.

4576
03:40:03,460 --> 03:40:03,900
Alright.

4577
03:40:06,400 --> 03:40:06,940
Um...

4578
03:40:06,940 --> 03:40:08,600
I didn't get...

4579
03:40:08,600 --> 03:40:12,520
3, 2, 1, 3, 4, okay.

4580
03:40:13,260 --> 03:40:15,120
Making sure I got everything.

4581
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:17,220
Okay, cool.

4582
03:40:17,400 --> 03:40:17,840
Let's go down.

4583
03:40:20,120 --> 03:40:21,200
Making sure...

4584
03:40:21,200 --> 03:40:22,320
Okay, let's go down.

4585
03:40:25,890 --> 03:40:26,970
Making sure...

4586
03:40:26,970 --> 03:40:27,630
What's around here?

4587
03:40:27,850 --> 03:40:27,970
Okay.

4588
03:40:28,630 --> 03:40:30,550
Oh, take that.

4589
03:40:35,520 --> 03:40:36,860
Oh, that's fine, actually.

4590
03:40:37,180 --> 03:40:38,160
Not as far...

4591
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:40,340
Of a fall as I thought it would be.

4592
03:40:41,640 --> 03:40:44,060
You can get double rocket launchers.

4593
03:40:44,940 --> 03:40:45,340
Oh.

4594
03:40:50,320 --> 03:40:50,960
It's okay.

4595
03:40:51,220 --> 03:40:51,660
It's okay.

4596
03:40:52,040 --> 03:40:52,720
It's okay.

4597
03:40:54,980 --> 03:40:56,820
I think I already passed it.

4598
03:40:56,940 --> 03:40:58,180
I don't know if I already passed it or not.

4599
03:40:58,300 --> 03:40:59,560
I don't really... It's fine.

4600
03:40:59,680 --> 03:41:00,380
I already have one.

4601
03:41:00,380 --> 03:41:00,860
It's okay.

4602
03:41:03,280 --> 03:41:04,800
It's for later only.

4603
03:41:05,120 --> 03:41:05,500
Oh, see?

4604
03:41:05,620 --> 03:41:06,420
Then it doesn't really matter.

4605
03:41:08,900 --> 03:41:10,080
Then it doesn't really matter.

4606
03:41:10,220 --> 03:41:10,440
It's okay.

4607
03:41:10,720 --> 03:41:11,380
Just keep going.

4608
03:41:11,580 --> 03:41:12,600
Yeah, we'll just keep going.

4609
03:41:16,140 --> 03:41:17,540
We're remodeling the city?

4610
03:41:18,540 --> 03:41:19,500
Chat is fighting.

4611
03:41:19,640 --> 03:41:20,060
Yeah, guys.

4612
03:41:20,200 --> 03:41:20,800
Stop fighting.

4613
03:41:21,440 --> 03:41:22,120
It's okay.

4614
03:41:22,120 --> 03:41:23,560
Don't worry about it.

4615
03:41:28,360 --> 03:41:30,500
It doesn't really feel like a spoiler.

4616
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:34,460
I'll trust you guys that it is a spoiler.

4617
03:41:34,760 --> 03:41:36,300
But it doesn't really feel like one.

4618
03:41:36,880 --> 03:41:38,320
Maybe because...

4619
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:40,180
Oh?

4620
03:41:40,520 --> 03:41:40,900
Aha.

4621
03:41:41,660 --> 03:41:43,900
Maybe because it just feels like a...

4622
03:41:43,900 --> 03:41:45,240
Like a weapon spoiler.

4623
03:41:46,900 --> 03:41:47,460
Nice.

4624
03:41:54,640 --> 03:41:56,260
No, I like to fight.

4625
03:41:56,980 --> 03:41:58,160
Chatter is wrong.

4626
03:42:03,660 --> 03:42:05,560
Oh, it's these guys again.

4627
03:42:15,440 --> 03:42:17,260
Oh, they're a little jumpy, huh?

4628
03:42:19,060 --> 03:42:19,920
Oh, nice.

4629
03:42:24,490 --> 03:42:25,050
Yeah!

4630
03:42:44,410 --> 03:42:44,970
Dude.

4631
03:42:45,910 --> 03:42:46,290
Wee!

4632
03:42:46,390 --> 03:42:47,050
Wake up back!

4633
03:42:47,310 --> 03:42:47,870
Wake up back!

4634
03:42:48,110 --> 03:42:48,510
Wake up back!

4635
03:42:49,290 --> 03:42:50,430
Wake up back!

4636
03:42:50,630 --> 03:42:51,090
Wake up back!

4637
03:42:52,770 --> 03:42:53,770
You dance?

4638
03:42:53,950 --> 03:42:54,550
I dance?

4639
03:42:55,190 --> 03:42:56,450
Let's summon Spartan!

4640
03:42:56,550 --> 03:42:57,630
We're worshipping Sparta?

4641
03:42:58,790 --> 03:42:59,310
Let's bow back.

4642
03:43:00,390 --> 03:43:01,150
He's laughing.

4643
03:43:01,370 --> 03:43:02,010
He likes it?

4644
03:43:02,210 --> 03:43:03,210
I'm on fire!

4645
03:43:04,790 --> 03:43:05,730
Show me dance?

4646
03:43:05,770 --> 03:43:06,790
Show me dance?

4647
03:43:07,390 --> 03:43:09,970
Knock on beat.

4648
03:43:09,970 --> 03:43:10,850
I'm fired up.

4649
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:21,820
Now it just...

4650
03:43:29,380 --> 03:43:30,140
Wait.

4651
03:43:31,120 --> 03:43:32,400
How do I...

4652
03:43:34,880 --> 03:43:35,900
Oh no!

4653
03:43:35,900 --> 03:43:37,460
Oh, he transformed into the grabby.

4654
03:43:40,780 --> 03:43:41,400
That's right.

4655
03:43:42,360 --> 03:43:43,720
You think you can handle me?

4656
03:43:47,180 --> 03:43:48,700
Oh, sword... Wait, what was I on?

4657
03:43:49,680 --> 03:43:50,800
How am I not on Swordmaster?

4658
03:43:51,480 --> 03:43:52,680
I am on Swordmaster.

4659
03:43:52,880 --> 03:43:54,640
Oh wait, I just gotta press the Swordmaster button.

4660
03:43:56,500 --> 03:43:58,220
But I thought... Hold on.

4661
03:44:01,720 --> 03:44:02,120
Wait.

4662
03:44:03,820 --> 03:44:05,240
That's what I was trying to do.

4663
03:44:05,500 --> 03:44:06,820
That's what I was trying to land.

4664
03:44:10,580 --> 03:44:14,180
I mean, though my dad works for Nintendo and he says you can have three rocket launchers.

4665
03:44:14,880 --> 03:44:18,100
If you beat the next boss, only your royal guard.

4666
03:44:18,860 --> 03:44:20,660
Why does mom let you have...

4667
03:44:20,660 --> 03:44:24,640
Why does mom let you have three rocket launchers?

4668
03:44:25,400 --> 03:44:28,200
Why does mom let you have two rocket launchers?

4669
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:29,560
Oh, wait.

4670
03:44:29,740 --> 03:44:30,380
Sorry, I'm a bad.

4671
03:44:34,120 --> 03:44:35,800
Just seeing if there's anything else.

4672
03:44:35,800 --> 03:44:36,660
I guess not.

4673
03:44:36,900 --> 03:44:37,320
Okay, cool.

4674
03:44:39,360 --> 03:44:42,020
Well, mom's letting you have ten rocket launchers.

4675
03:44:42,620 --> 03:44:43,980
Wait, isn't this what opened up?

4676
03:44:44,480 --> 03:44:45,220
Or here?

4677
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:48,020
There we go.

4678
03:44:49,620 --> 03:44:53,780
Mom's letting me have 1500 rocket launchers.

4679
03:44:55,400 --> 03:44:57,780
I'm the... I'm the favorite of the family.

4680
03:45:01,560 --> 03:45:02,040
Oop.

4681
03:45:02,240 --> 03:45:02,540
Oop.

4682
03:45:03,620 --> 03:45:04,100
Wait.

4683
03:45:04,300 --> 03:45:04,760
No, come here.

4684
03:45:05,480 --> 03:45:06,340
No, stop it.

4685
03:45:06,480 --> 03:45:07,460
Stop doing that, Dante.

4686
03:45:07,940 --> 03:45:08,400
There we go.

4687
03:45:17,670 --> 03:45:18,810
Anything up here?

4688
03:45:20,070 --> 03:45:20,550
No.

4689
03:45:22,810 --> 03:45:24,030
Nothing up there?

4690
03:45:28,350 --> 03:45:28,950
Blorb?

4691
03:45:29,210 --> 03:45:30,450
I already got the blurb, no?

4692
03:45:32,410 --> 03:45:33,690
This is the spot.

4693
03:45:33,850 --> 03:45:34,210
What spot?

4694
03:45:38,440 --> 03:45:39,340
This case?

4695
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:48,720
This is where the rocket originally is.

4696
03:45:49,380 --> 03:45:49,800
Oh.

4697
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:50,280
Well, see?

4698
03:45:50,480 --> 03:45:51,140
It's not here.

4699
03:45:54,100 --> 03:45:55,320
I already got it.

4700
03:45:57,760 --> 03:45:59,300
So I couldn't have gotten to.

4701
03:46:03,570 --> 03:46:04,470
I could have gotten to.

4702
03:46:05,050 --> 03:46:06,150
I'm assessing...

4703
03:46:07,030 --> 03:46:07,630
Ohhoaaa!

4704
03:46:09,050 --> 03:46:09,650
Wait.

4705
03:46:12,660 --> 03:46:14,080
Can I just jump for this?

4706
03:46:14,500 --> 03:46:16,300
Oh, I think I've gotta be underneath it.

4707
03:46:18,120 --> 03:46:18,720
Yes!

4708
03:46:25,900 --> 03:46:26,500
Okay.

4709
03:46:26,740 --> 03:46:26,880
Cool.

4710
03:46:27,760 --> 03:46:28,040
Wait.

4711
03:46:28,360 --> 03:46:30,020
This looks like maybe...

4712
03:46:30,020 --> 03:46:31,020
The correct way?

4713
03:46:33,020 --> 03:46:34,320
What's over here first?

4714
03:46:39,010 --> 03:46:40,570
Oh, is this where I came from?

4715
03:46:42,390 --> 03:46:43,930
Oh, this is where I came from, just kidding.

4716
03:46:45,410 --> 03:46:46,330
We head back.

4717
03:46:48,890 --> 03:46:49,910
I'm not lost.

4718
03:47:01,040 --> 03:47:02,080
You trying to hit me?

4719
03:47:02,300 --> 03:47:03,340
You trying to hit me?

4720
03:47:03,680 --> 03:47:05,480
You trying to hit me?

4721
03:47:12,680 --> 03:47:14,000
I don't think so.

4722
03:47:14,820 --> 03:47:16,320
You trying to hit me?

4723
03:47:17,100 --> 03:47:18,400
You trying to hit me?

4724
03:47:22,500 --> 03:47:23,940
You trying to hit me?

4725
03:47:28,090 --> 03:47:30,550
You trying to hit me?!

4726
03:47:30,550 --> 03:47:36,770
Yeah!

4727
03:47:39,250 --> 03:47:40,770
That's Dante style!

4728
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:56,280
Oh my god!

4729
03:48:00,140 --> 03:48:04,320
Actually, what is the button to figure- to direct you in the way when you're lost?

4730
03:48:04,480 --> 03:48:06,300
I think it's left stick, right?

4731
03:48:07,880 --> 03:48:08,200
Wait.

4732
03:48:09,540 --> 03:48:09,860
What?

4733
03:48:10,620 --> 03:48:11,820
Oh, it's right stick.

4734
03:48:12,440 --> 03:48:13,440
Ah, I see, I see.

4735
03:48:20,360 --> 03:48:20,640
Okay.

4736
03:48:20,640 --> 03:48:20,920
Oh.

4737
03:48:26,660 --> 03:48:26,940
Nice!

4738
03:48:28,700 --> 03:48:29,740
Oh, I have to hold it.

4739
03:48:29,820 --> 03:48:30,440
Oh, it is left.

4740
03:48:30,660 --> 03:48:30,780
Wait.

4741
03:48:32,720 --> 03:48:33,000
Ah!

4742
03:48:33,640 --> 03:48:34,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4743
03:48:34,640 --> 03:48:34,820
Okay.

4744
03:48:36,060 --> 03:48:39,440
I think left or right is just to fix the camera.

4745
03:48:40,020 --> 03:48:40,700
Like that.

4746
03:48:40,880 --> 03:48:41,200
Yeah, yeah.

4747
03:48:41,440 --> 03:48:41,600
Okay.

4748
03:48:42,360 --> 03:48:43,820
You trying to hit me?!

4749
03:48:46,420 --> 03:48:46,860
Oh.

4750
03:48:47,220 --> 03:48:48,620
Wait, this doesn't look so good.

4751
03:48:50,080 --> 03:48:50,520
Oh!

4752
03:48:50,520 --> 03:48:50,960
Oh!

4753
03:48:51,340 --> 03:48:52,840
Oh, this doesn't look so good.

4754
03:48:53,040 --> 03:48:53,820
Who are you?!

4755
03:48:53,820 --> 03:48:54,380
Who are you?!

4756
03:49:02,540 --> 03:49:03,140
Oh!

4757
03:49:03,440 --> 03:49:03,740
Oh!

4758
03:49:03,740 --> 03:49:04,420
What are you summoning?

4759
03:49:04,700 --> 03:49:04,920
Oh.

4760
03:49:06,740 --> 03:49:07,340
Oh.

4761
03:49:08,920 --> 03:49:09,520
Ah.

4762
03:49:09,640 --> 03:49:10,140
Haha, me too.

4763
03:49:11,720 --> 03:49:12,320
Hell.

4764
03:49:13,140 --> 03:49:13,740
Judico!

4765
03:49:29,470 --> 03:49:31,150
Oh, he's tough to get to.

4766
03:49:34,110 --> 03:49:37,130
Yeah, I took care of your- I took care of your minions.

4767
03:49:38,630 --> 03:49:40,730
Oh, I forgot that I have that!

4768
03:49:41,130 --> 03:49:41,870
Haha, quip!

4769
03:49:44,970 --> 03:49:46,290
Oh, you're summoning more?

4770
03:49:52,560 --> 03:49:54,720
Oh, you got a big boy this time.

4771
03:49:54,720 --> 03:49:56,180
fucking kh inquiring!

4772
03:49:58,700 --> 03:49:59,860
Oh, boy.

4773
03:50:12,010 --> 03:50:12,990
That's right.

4774
03:50:18,110 --> 03:50:20,410
Yeah, I parry your attack.

4775
03:50:21,630 --> 03:50:23,230
And I dodge it too.

4776
03:50:23,650 --> 03:50:25,510
And I also don't attack you.

4777
03:50:25,730 --> 03:50:29,590
Because I'm, I also miss... I miss some throws.

4778
03:50:29,590 --> 03:50:32,950
But that's just part of the method.

4779
03:50:33,970 --> 03:50:36,090
I do a little bit of a fake out.

4780
03:50:38,850 --> 03:50:42,370
That's just how Dante fights.

4781
03:50:45,830 --> 03:50:47,370
That's just how he works.

4782
03:50:48,210 --> 03:50:50,250
That's just his little Dante way.

4783
03:50:50,750 --> 03:50:51,090
Oh wait.

4784
03:50:52,190 --> 03:50:53,650
I almost missed that.

4785
03:50:54,970 --> 03:50:56,090
Okay, never mind.

4786
03:50:56,170 --> 03:50:57,130
I was going the right way.

4787
03:50:57,350 --> 03:50:59,350
I thought for some reason this would be the way.

4788
03:51:00,410 --> 03:51:01,550
This is the way.

4789
03:51:02,470 --> 03:51:04,430
Oh, reliable DT Stinger.

4790
03:51:04,670 --> 03:51:05,450
I know, right?

4791
03:51:06,050 --> 03:51:07,130
She never misses.

4792
03:51:07,710 --> 03:51:09,090
Well, she does, but you know.

4793
03:51:15,210 --> 03:51:16,410
Oh, you guys again.

4794
03:51:19,650 --> 03:51:20,590
Where's the big boy?

4795
03:51:20,870 --> 03:51:20,970
Oh.

4796
03:51:22,150 --> 03:51:23,250
It's just the minions?

4797
03:51:23,610 --> 03:51:24,150
Wait, what's that?

4798
03:51:25,410 --> 03:51:26,830
Wait, what's this in the sky?

4799
03:51:28,250 --> 03:51:29,530
Oh, is it Hellbat?

4800
03:51:35,820 --> 03:51:37,360
No, I'm not trying to get you.

4801
03:51:37,480 --> 03:51:38,320
I'm trying to get the Hellbat.

4802
03:51:41,530 --> 03:51:41,890
Ouch!

4803
03:51:55,310 --> 03:51:55,670
Yep.

4804
03:51:55,950 --> 03:51:56,030
Yep.

4805
03:51:56,350 --> 03:51:57,010
And Stinger.

4806
03:51:58,110 --> 03:51:59,090
And... Yep.

4807
03:51:59,330 --> 03:52:00,890
And let's get you in the air.

4808
03:52:01,070 --> 03:52:01,610
Oh, dang it.

4809
03:52:01,610 --> 03:52:02,230
I was so close.

4810
03:52:02,570 --> 03:52:02,790
Come here.

4811
03:52:02,930 --> 03:52:03,090
Come on.

4812
03:52:03,530 --> 03:52:04,030
Hold on.

4813
03:52:04,450 --> 03:52:05,070
Oh, there.

4814
03:52:05,270 --> 03:52:05,510
Yeah, yeah.

4815
03:52:06,930 --> 03:52:16,280
And... Oh, I did not notice the flames that were being... Yeah.

4816
03:52:16,480 --> 03:52:18,120
Stop doing that, stupid guy.

4817
03:52:19,580 --> 03:52:21,300
Go explode over here.

4818
03:52:21,780 --> 03:52:22,680
Leave me alone.

4819
03:52:22,820 --> 03:52:23,520
Leave me out of it.

4820
03:52:23,860 --> 03:52:25,180
Leave me out of it, okay?

4821
03:52:25,360 --> 03:52:27,940
I don't want to deal with your little explosions.

4822
03:52:29,180 --> 03:52:30,700
You got your own plans.

4823
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:31,120
Ah!

4824
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:32,300
Oh, nice parry.

4825
03:52:37,910 --> 03:52:39,610
Red Zubai is...

4826
03:52:40,730 --> 03:52:43,150
App's name because he's just as annoying, right?

4827
03:52:45,030 --> 03:52:46,230
Why did I try to do that?

4828
03:52:46,590 --> 03:52:47,010
There we go.

4829
03:52:48,770 --> 03:52:49,690
Enterprise...

4830
03:52:51,590 --> 03:52:52,510
Haha.

4831
03:52:53,910 --> 03:52:54,590
Haha.

4832
03:53:04,840 --> 03:53:05,400
Haha.

4833
03:53:05,400 --> 03:53:05,600
Haha.

4834
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:09,000
Haha.

4835
03:53:09,000 --> 03:53:09,620
Haha.

4836
03:53:09,620 --> 03:53:10,060
Eww!

4837
03:53:13,900 --> 03:53:14,820
Oh.

4838
03:53:15,900 --> 03:53:16,820
Oh.

4839
03:53:16,820 --> 03:53:17,740
Oh, there he is.

4840
03:53:18,720 --> 03:53:19,640
Oh!

4841
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:20,340
Oh!

4842
03:53:20,380 --> 03:53:20,460
There's another one!

4843
03:53:23,560 --> 03:53:25,040
Wait, there's another one!

4844
03:53:25,460 --> 03:53:25,920
...

4845
03:53:26,500 --> 03:53:27,420
...

4846
03:53:50,620 --> 03:53:51,700
Oh, he stood up.

4847
03:53:53,520 --> 03:53:53,920
Ouch.

4848
03:54:06,730 --> 03:54:09,270
Wait, what are you... Did you explode all by yourself?

4849
03:54:13,920 --> 03:54:14,600
Oh, damn.

4850
03:54:14,860 --> 03:54:15,340
Oh my gosh.

4851
03:54:15,660 --> 03:54:16,860
That thing gets me every time.

4852
03:54:24,910 --> 03:54:26,090
I don't like the Hellbat.

4853
03:54:26,990 --> 03:54:27,930
They're annoying.

4854
03:54:36,180 --> 03:54:37,700
I hate the Hellbat.

4855
03:54:38,080 --> 03:54:39,300
I hate Hellbat.

4856
03:54:39,660 --> 03:54:41,060
I hate Hellbat.

4857
03:54:41,420 --> 03:54:42,540
I hate Hellbat.

4858
03:54:42,920 --> 03:54:43,880
I hate Hellbat.

4859
03:54:44,920 --> 03:54:46,860
Wait, I thought he was gonna explode!

4860
03:54:52,020 --> 03:54:52,940
Oh yeah.

4861
03:55:00,510 --> 03:55:07,430
The slow-mo freeze frame with holding the rocket launcher was pretty good.

4862
03:55:07,430 --> 03:55:08,450
I'm not gonna lie.

4863
03:55:09,270 --> 03:55:10,550
That was pretty good.

4864
03:55:11,430 --> 03:55:12,590
Wait, was this room also optional?

4865
03:55:17,230 --> 03:55:18,290
But we got a pour!

4866
03:55:18,530 --> 03:55:19,830
We got a full pour out of it!

4867
03:55:22,210 --> 03:55:24,450
Dante's the only reason I come back to play DMC5.

4868
03:55:31,810 --> 03:55:32,410
Okay.

4869
03:55:33,250 --> 03:55:34,470
Something fell, no?

4870
03:55:35,730 --> 03:55:36,390
Oh wait.

4871
03:55:36,930 --> 03:55:37,350
Here!

4872
03:55:38,430 --> 03:55:39,570
Nope, just kidding.

4873
03:55:40,030 --> 03:55:40,170
Wait.

4874
03:55:40,710 --> 03:55:41,250
Here!

4875
03:55:43,790 --> 03:55:44,390
Oh!

4876
03:55:44,590 --> 03:55:45,570
Yes, yes, yes!

4877
03:55:46,830 --> 03:55:47,430
Wait...

4878
03:55:47,430 --> 03:55:47,850
Oh no!

4879
03:55:48,150 --> 03:55:48,510
No, no!

4880
03:55:50,330 --> 03:55:51,430
We can make it.

4881
03:55:52,710 --> 03:55:54,030
Oh, we can't make it.

4882
03:55:59,250 --> 03:56:00,450
Oh, many...

4883
03:56:00,450 --> 03:56:02,210
Many Rorbs were lost that day.

4884
03:56:05,290 --> 03:56:06,870
You can triple jump and D2.

4885
03:56:06,970 --> 03:56:08,530
Do I want to waste my D2?

4886
03:56:08,990 --> 03:56:09,410
Wait.

4887
03:56:11,730 --> 03:56:12,570
Wait.

4888
03:56:12,570 --> 03:56:13,710
I have full DT.

4889
03:56:16,090 --> 03:56:18,850
Do I want to waste it for Rorbs?

4890
03:56:22,030 --> 03:56:23,530
It's probably like...

4891
03:56:23,530 --> 03:56:24,090
Can't a guy get a break?

4892
03:56:24,530 --> 03:56:26,470
I just woke up from a long ass nap.

4893
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:28,790
I know.

4894
03:56:29,070 --> 03:56:29,130
Oh.

4895
03:56:33,670 --> 03:56:37,090
Can't a guy get a break around here?

4896
03:56:42,190 --> 03:56:43,850
Can't a guy catch a break?

4897
03:56:44,170 --> 03:56:46,470
I like these things though, because they drop health.

4898
03:56:47,110 --> 03:56:48,510
Well, I don't like them, but you know.

4899
03:56:49,030 --> 03:56:50,050
They're not as...

4900
03:56:50,050 --> 03:56:51,890
They're not nearly as bad as...

4901
03:56:51,890 --> 03:56:54,010
Some of the other little minions, you know?

4902
03:56:57,950 --> 03:56:59,190
Dante's getting old.

4903
03:56:59,670 --> 03:57:00,910
My old man!

4904
03:57:01,330 --> 03:57:02,130
My old man!

4905
03:57:02,330 --> 03:57:02,690
Hi, Dante!

4906
03:57:05,330 --> 03:57:07,430
Yeah, easy green... green orb.

4907
03:57:11,350 --> 03:57:11,910
Okay.

4908
03:57:12,130 --> 03:57:13,470
I haven't really...

4909
03:57:13,470 --> 03:57:15,910
We're moving left or right during welter move.

4910
03:57:16,530 --> 03:57:18,230
What the hell is welter move?

4911
03:57:21,010 --> 03:57:23,370
Execute a counter in the direction you dodged.

4912
03:57:23,950 --> 03:57:25,210
Is it just a dodge?

4913
03:57:26,090 --> 03:57:26,870
Try it out?

4914
03:57:27,290 --> 03:57:28,390
I don't think I understand.

4915
03:57:33,340 --> 03:57:35,100
I think I can go get some more winers soon.

4916
03:57:36,940 --> 03:57:37,640
Oh, whoops.

4917
03:57:40,140 --> 03:57:40,820
No, no, no.

4918
03:57:41,960 --> 03:57:42,620
There we go.

4919
03:57:44,160 --> 03:57:44,560
So...

4920
03:57:44,560 --> 03:57:47,480
When moving left or right during welter...

4921
03:58:04,800 --> 03:58:05,860
While holding it.

4922
03:58:06,040 --> 03:58:06,580
Oh, so I have

4923
03:58:11,020 --> 03:58:11,380
to...

4924
03:58:11,380 --> 03:58:12,920
I don't think it's a win to walk on.

4925
03:58:12,920 --> 03:58:13,200
I don't think it's a win to walk on.

4926
03:58:13,420 --> 03:58:13,960
Oh, oop.

4927
03:58:14,220 --> 03:58:15,060
I heard of...

4928
03:58:20,680 --> 03:58:22,680
Is it not just the dodge that I was doing?

4929
03:58:25,140 --> 03:58:27,060
It's a body blow after dodge.

4930
03:58:28,260 --> 03:58:29,040
I can't tell.

4931
03:58:29,280 --> 03:58:30,480
Because it just says press Y.

4932
03:58:30,620 --> 03:58:32,260
It doesn't say hold Y or anything.

4933
03:58:36,480 --> 03:58:36,960
Hello?

4934
03:58:37,780 --> 03:58:40,080
I hate controls sometimes.

4935
03:58:44,580 --> 03:58:45,780
So like that.

4936
03:58:50,600 --> 03:58:51,840
Press Y again.

4937
03:58:52,020 --> 03:58:53,520
Is that just not a normal hit?

4938
03:58:53,520 --> 03:58:54,100
What?

4939
03:59:13,300 --> 03:59:14,720
Was that it?

4940
03:59:16,380 --> 03:59:17,820
Was that it?

4941
03:59:26,740 --> 03:59:27,400
Like that?

4942
03:59:29,920 --> 03:59:30,760
Wait.

4943
03:59:35,800 --> 03:59:36,620
Oh my gosh.

4944
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:37,440
Please.

4945
03:59:37,700 --> 03:59:37,920
Please.

4946
03:59:38,160 --> 03:59:38,580
Please.

4947
03:59:38,580 --> 03:59:38,700
Please.

4948
03:59:38,780 --> 03:59:42,500
I hate how I can't dodge when the camera is like, you know.

4949
03:59:50,540 --> 03:59:51,740
It's strict timing.

4950
03:59:51,940 --> 03:59:52,860
Yeah, it feels like it.

4951
03:59:55,280 --> 03:59:56,640
I don't get it at all.

4952
03:59:57,380 --> 03:59:58,700
I don't get it at all.

4953
04:00:02,000 --> 04:00:02,700
It's fine.

4954
04:00:03,060 --> 04:00:04,220
I don't have to get it.

4955
04:00:06,340 --> 04:00:07,680
I don't have to get it.

4956
04:00:09,560 --> 04:00:10,040
Mmm.

4957
04:00:11,740 --> 04:00:13,300
After executing a heavy jolt.

4958
04:00:16,420 --> 04:00:17,720
Most people don't even use it.

4959
04:00:17,960 --> 04:00:18,520
That's okay too.

4960
04:00:19,100 --> 04:00:19,400
I don't know.

4961
04:00:19,620 --> 04:00:20,560
It's confusing.

4962
04:00:20,860 --> 04:00:21,420
I don't get it.

4963
04:00:21,540 --> 04:00:22,040
It's okay though.

4964
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:23,900
It's a-okay.

4965
04:00:24,380 --> 04:00:25,340
A kick mode.

4966
04:00:30,200 --> 04:00:30,680
Oh.

4967
04:00:31,280 --> 04:00:32,880
It's like not stinger.

4968
04:00:39,970 --> 04:00:40,690
Oh yeah.

4969
04:00:40,930 --> 04:00:41,070
Why?

4970
04:00:41,130 --> 04:00:42,210
I should just buy this.

4971
04:00:43,590 --> 04:00:44,550
Learn it.

4972
04:00:45,190 --> 04:00:46,770
Just to have it.

4973
04:00:56,230 --> 04:00:59,130
Do I not already activate the 10 count?

4974
04:01:08,100 --> 04:01:09,480
This is a stronger buff.

4975
04:01:09,640 --> 04:01:09,800
Oh.

4976
04:01:10,320 --> 04:01:11,720
Well that would probably be good then, right?

4977
04:01:13,160 --> 04:01:14,260
It lasts longer.

4978
04:01:14,760 --> 04:01:15,240
Ah.

4979
04:01:15,900 --> 04:01:16,780
We'll learn that then.

4980
04:01:17,400 --> 04:01:18,360
That should be good.

4981
04:01:20,240 --> 04:01:21,360
Since I use it so much.

4982
04:01:26,140 --> 04:01:26,820
Oh yeah.

4983
04:01:26,960 --> 04:01:29,260
It literally says effects remain active for longer.

4984
04:01:30,120 --> 04:01:31,080
Read VTuber!

4985
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:32,100
Why don't you read?

4986
04:01:33,480 --> 04:01:35,500
Instead I'm just watching the little movie.

4987
04:01:36,000 --> 04:01:37,540
I'm like, I don't get it.

4988
04:01:39,520 --> 04:01:40,380
I don't know.

4989
04:01:40,380 --> 04:01:40,740
I don't know.

4990
04:01:40,920 --> 04:01:42,440
What's the move do?

4991
04:01:44,580 --> 04:01:46,340
I should just read it.

4992
04:01:54,880 --> 04:01:56,340
I'm just watching the movie.

4993
04:01:56,540 --> 04:01:57,140
I'm like, yeah.

4994
04:01:58,740 --> 04:01:59,940
It's doing a thing.

4995
04:02:00,560 --> 04:02:01,000
Let's see.

4996
04:02:01,100 --> 04:02:02,600
How much is an upgraded sword?

4997
04:02:02,600 --> 04:02:03,000
Oh.

4998
04:02:03,980 --> 04:02:05,240
We would've had enough.

4999
04:02:07,120 --> 04:02:07,940
Air trick.

5000
04:02:08,120 --> 04:02:08,260
Wait.

5001
04:02:09,060 --> 04:02:10,180
What was air trick?

5002
04:02:10,360 --> 04:02:11,660
I haven't switched styles at all.

5003
04:02:11,720 --> 04:02:12,220
I'll be honest.

5004
04:02:12,440 --> 04:02:14,600
Because I'm using sword master so much.

5005
04:02:15,920 --> 04:02:16,960
I'm using...

5006
04:02:16,960 --> 04:02:19,380
I'm using the punch in sword master so much.

5007
04:02:21,880 --> 04:02:23,060
It's the teleport.

5008
04:02:25,940 --> 04:02:26,620
It's the teleport.

5009
04:02:26,620 --> 04:02:28,160
I'm gonna get water in just a minute.

5010
04:02:31,580 --> 04:02:32,260
Wait.

5011
04:02:32,800 --> 04:02:32,920
Wait.

5012
04:02:33,260 --> 04:02:33,500
Oh.

5013
04:02:34,080 --> 04:02:34,760
Oh.

5014
04:02:35,120 --> 04:02:35,500
There we go.

5015
04:02:37,540 --> 04:02:38,220
Press.

5016
04:02:38,880 --> 04:02:39,960
R.B.

5017
04:02:40,300 --> 04:02:40,880
R.B.

5018
04:02:42,140 --> 04:02:43,240
There we go.

5019
04:02:44,340 --> 04:02:44,880
Wait.

5020
04:02:44,980 --> 04:02:46,480
After executing a star...

5021
04:02:46,480 --> 04:02:47,340
Sky star?

5022
04:02:48,180 --> 04:02:50,020
Well, I don't even know what that is.

5023
04:02:52,120 --> 04:02:54,280
Once again, we love our illiterate Oshis.

5024
04:02:54,480 --> 04:02:55,540
How far does this work?

5025
04:02:56,660 --> 04:02:57,100
Like...

5026
04:02:57,100 --> 04:02:58,120
I'm running.

5027
04:02:58,340 --> 04:02:58,600
I'm running.

5028
04:02:58,800 --> 04:02:59,100
I'm running.

5029
04:02:59,240 --> 04:02:59,540
I'm running.

5030
04:02:59,700 --> 04:02:59,980
I'm running.

5031
04:03:03,190 --> 04:03:03,950
Oh, wow.

5032
04:03:04,130 --> 04:03:04,350
Really?

5033
04:03:04,590 --> 04:03:05,030
Wow.

5034
04:03:07,310 --> 04:03:07,750
What?

5035
04:03:07,870 --> 04:03:08,570
That's crazy.

5036
04:03:12,250 --> 04:03:12,690
Sky...

5037
04:03:12,690 --> 04:03:14,110
Sky star is air dash.

5038
04:03:14,270 --> 04:03:14,390
Okay.

5039
04:03:16,270 --> 04:03:16,710
Wait.

5040
04:03:18,790 --> 04:03:19,230
Wait.

5041
04:03:21,950 --> 04:03:23,050
I'm holding me.

5042
04:03:23,890 --> 04:03:24,390
Come on.

5043
04:03:27,250 --> 04:03:28,830
Yeah, that worked really far.

5044
04:03:29,370 --> 04:03:30,530
Yeah, you do have to lock on.

5045
04:03:30,630 --> 04:03:31,330
But that's not so bad.

5046
04:03:32,610 --> 04:03:33,350
I'm going...

5047
04:03:33,350 --> 04:03:34,290
I'm gonna go to the edge.

5048
04:03:34,470 --> 04:03:34,830
Here we go.

5049
04:03:39,850 --> 04:03:41,390
Oh, but we're not locked on.

5050
04:03:43,350 --> 04:03:44,710
We're not locked on.

5051
04:03:44,890 --> 04:03:45,270
Oh, there we go.

5052
04:03:46,530 --> 04:03:46,950
Wait.

5053
04:03:46,950 --> 04:03:49,430
And you have to be on the ground, it seems.

5054
04:03:50,110 --> 04:03:50,950
Not worth it.

5055
04:03:51,110 --> 04:03:51,890
To me.

5056
04:03:53,030 --> 04:03:53,610
Not right now.

5057
04:03:54,790 --> 04:03:56,890
I love Swordmaster in this game.

5058
04:03:57,110 --> 04:03:57,930
It's so OP.

5059
04:04:02,150 --> 04:04:02,630
Okay.

5060
04:04:02,770 --> 04:04:04,130
I'm gonna go get some water.

5061
04:04:05,830 --> 04:04:06,310
Everybody.

5062
04:04:07,790 --> 04:04:08,330
Oh, wait.

5063
04:04:08,550 --> 04:04:09,230
I just quit.

5064
04:04:09,410 --> 04:04:09,610
Oops.

5065
04:04:09,730 --> 04:04:09,910
My bad.

5066
04:04:10,010 --> 04:04:10,250
Hold on.

5067
04:04:10,490 --> 04:04:11,470
I'm gonna get some water.

5068
04:04:16,610 --> 04:04:16,970
And...

5069
04:04:19,910 --> 04:04:22,170
And I need to use a little ghosty's room.

5070
04:04:22,310 --> 04:04:23,650
So just a short, short break.

5071
04:04:25,390 --> 04:04:26,150
I say break.

5072
04:04:26,150 --> 04:04:27,290
I'll be back in like a minute.

5073
04:04:28,730 --> 04:04:30,890
I will be back.

5074
04:04:31,590 --> 04:04:32,550
I will be back.

5075
04:04:33,570 --> 04:04:34,010
Okay.

5076
04:04:34,750 --> 04:04:35,330
Water.

5077
04:04:37,750 --> 04:04:39,270
There we go.

5078
04:08:03,950 --> 04:08:06,110
Oh yeah, baby.

5079
04:08:07,810 --> 04:08:10,070
Thank you guys.

5080
04:08:10,490 --> 04:08:11,130
Thank you.

5081
04:08:11,890 --> 04:08:13,190
Welcome back.

5082
04:08:13,910 --> 04:08:14,710
Thank you.

5083
04:08:17,170 --> 04:08:18,710
I missed the...

5084
04:08:18,710 --> 04:08:19,650
I missed the...

5085
04:08:19,650 --> 04:08:20,590
The...

5086
04:08:20,590 --> 04:08:22,670
Divinity statue music from...

5087
04:08:22,670 --> 04:08:23,130
For...

5088
04:08:23,130 --> 04:08:23,730
I'm not gonna lie.

5089
04:08:24,730 --> 04:08:26,070
I really liked it.

5090
04:08:26,890 --> 04:08:27,610
Alright.

5091
04:08:29,490 --> 04:08:30,890
Let's get going.

5092
04:08:34,250 --> 04:08:35,130
Uh-oh.

5093
04:08:36,350 --> 04:08:37,730
This looks like...

5094
04:08:38,430 --> 04:08:38,770
Okay.

5095
04:08:39,630 --> 04:08:40,150
Uh-oh.

5096
04:08:41,490 --> 04:08:41,970
Woah.

5097
04:08:43,230 --> 04:08:43,830
Woah.

5098
04:08:45,250 --> 04:08:47,690
It doesn't look as powerful as before.

5099
04:08:47,990 --> 04:08:48,690
It's...

5100
04:08:48,690 --> 04:08:49,570
It looks...

5101
04:08:49,570 --> 04:08:50,970
It looks like it's been beaten up.

5102
04:08:50,970 --> 04:08:51,810
You're just gonna let me through.

5103
04:08:52,490 --> 04:08:54,490
Boy, wouldn't that be the day.

5104
04:08:55,210 --> 04:08:55,830
I'm...

5105
04:08:55,830 --> 04:08:56,410
I'm...

5106
04:08:56,410 --> 04:08:57,070
I'm...

5107
04:08:57,070 --> 04:08:58,650
I hear you, Dante.

5108
04:09:00,450 --> 04:09:01,070
Wait.

5109
04:09:01,170 --> 04:09:02,930
Let's look around a little bit before...

5110
04:09:02,930 --> 04:09:03,250
Wait.

5111
04:09:03,410 --> 04:09:04,880
Isn't this where we fought...

5112
04:09:07,610 --> 04:09:08,230
Um...

5113
04:09:09,570 --> 04:09:10,190
Uh...

5114
04:09:10,190 --> 04:09:11,810
Isn't this where we fought...

5115
04:09:12,950 --> 04:09:13,570
The...

5116
04:09:13,570 --> 04:09:15,030
Guy before...

5117
04:09:15,030 --> 04:09:15,810
With, uh...

5118
04:09:15,810 --> 04:09:15,950
V?

5119
04:09:18,610 --> 04:09:19,890
The tentacle guy.

5120
04:09:26,100 --> 04:09:26,980
It looks...

5121
04:09:26,980 --> 04:09:27,380
Oh...

5122
04:09:27,380 --> 04:09:27,800
Maybe not.

5123
04:09:27,960 --> 04:09:29,420
There was like more stores and stuff.

5124
04:09:29,580 --> 04:09:30,560
Unless it's like all...

5125
04:09:30,560 --> 04:09:31,440
Busted up.

5126
04:09:31,980 --> 04:09:32,280
Now.

5127
04:09:32,480 --> 04:09:32,920
I don't know.

5128
04:09:33,100 --> 04:09:34,300
There were like more stores and everything.

5129
04:09:34,780 --> 04:09:36,000
It looks kinda similar.

5130
04:09:36,100 --> 04:09:37,280
Like a similar road, right?

5131
04:09:38,180 --> 04:09:40,340
Pairing you with your ideal home.

5132
04:09:41,680 --> 04:09:44,060
Dante looks so cool with his hair blowing in the wind.

5133
04:09:47,260 --> 04:09:48,740
I don't remember the name of it.

5134
04:09:50,360 --> 04:09:50,800
Oh!

5135
04:09:51,080 --> 04:09:51,780
A bike?

5136
04:09:52,020 --> 04:09:52,460
Hello?

5137
04:09:55,620 --> 04:09:57,320
Are you just riding a bike?

5138
04:09:57,940 --> 04:09:58,460
Oh gosh.

5139
04:09:58,460 --> 04:09:59,360
Is it Halloween already?

5140
04:10:03,560 --> 04:10:05,140
That costume looks a little big.

5141
04:10:05,820 --> 04:10:07,540
I thought you had better taste than that.

5142
04:10:07,640 --> 04:10:09,480
I thought everybody did more trip to Sparta.

5143
04:10:11,000 --> 04:10:11,760
Oh gosh.

5144
04:10:11,940 --> 04:10:13,060
How about I take it in a little?

5145
04:10:13,460 --> 04:10:14,980
Oh, the one that had the horse.

5146
04:10:14,980 --> 04:10:16,380
Oh no.

5147
04:10:17,560 --> 04:10:18,040
Okay.

5148
04:10:18,120 --> 04:10:20,020
I feel like this guy might be better with Rebellion.

5149
04:10:20,280 --> 04:10:20,440
How long?

5150
04:10:21,940 --> 04:10:22,480
Or not.

5151
04:10:22,720 --> 04:10:23,400
Rebellion Sparta.

5152
04:10:28,140 --> 04:10:29,340
Good thing I started moving.

5153
04:10:31,920 --> 04:10:32,880
Holy huge!

5154
04:10:34,180 --> 04:10:34,880
Oh my god.

5155
04:10:36,860 --> 04:10:37,340
Oh!

5156
04:10:37,520 --> 04:10:38,480
He did the same thing to me.

5157
04:10:43,220 --> 04:10:43,700
Yah!

5158
04:10:44,660 --> 04:10:45,540
That's right.

5159
04:10:45,820 --> 04:10:46,880
I parry you.

5160
04:10:47,680 --> 04:10:48,100
Oh my gosh.

5161
04:10:49,320 --> 04:10:50,480
How do you know my name?

5162
04:10:53,920 --> 04:10:55,260
How do you know my name?

5163
04:10:57,860 --> 04:10:58,440
Yah!

5164
04:11:07,460 --> 04:11:07,820
Oh!

5165
04:11:08,440 --> 04:11:09,040
What's happening?

5166
04:11:10,900 --> 04:11:11,420
Okay.

5167
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:16,520
What are you doing?

5168
04:11:16,780 --> 04:11:17,320
I'm scared.

5169
04:11:17,320 --> 04:11:18,960
Maybe I should stop you from doing this.

5170
04:11:18,960 --> 04:11:19,120
Maybe I should stop you from doing this.

5171
04:11:20,720 --> 04:11:21,360
Oh!

5172
04:11:21,360 --> 04:11:23,040
You got how scary you are when you're met.

5173
04:11:26,120 --> 04:11:26,440
Ow!

5174
04:11:26,900 --> 04:11:27,080
Yah!

5175
04:11:27,920 --> 04:11:28,560
Unfair.

5176
04:11:31,200 --> 04:11:32,320
Oh my god!

5177
04:11:46,460 --> 04:11:47,100
Yah!

5178
04:12:10,730 --> 04:12:12,010
I parry you.

5179
04:12:12,810 --> 04:12:13,450
Yah!

5180
04:12:13,750 --> 04:12:14,410
I parry you.

5181
04:12:14,890 --> 04:12:15,350
Yah!

5182
04:12:16,430 --> 04:12:16,750
Oh.

5183
04:12:19,350 --> 04:12:21,110
I love hearing the fist sounds.

5184
04:12:21,250 --> 04:12:21,810
They're so funny.

5185
04:12:22,270 --> 04:12:22,730
Whee!

5186
04:12:25,050 --> 04:12:25,570
Alright.

5187
04:12:27,530 --> 04:12:29,130
Hey, you can spell that.

5188
04:12:32,090 --> 04:12:32,610
I

5189
04:12:37,630 --> 04:12:38,710
don't know if I should...

5190
04:12:38,710 --> 04:12:41,230
If I'm supposed to stop him from recharging or what.

5191
04:12:41,970 --> 04:12:42,650
You know?

5192
04:12:44,290 --> 04:12:44,810
Nice.

5193
04:12:52,870 --> 04:12:54,230
I tried to get out of the way.

5194
04:12:56,350 --> 04:12:57,070
Oh shoot.

5195
04:12:57,310 --> 04:12:57,570
Oh shoot.

5196
04:12:57,570 --> 04:12:57,750
Oh shoot.

5197
04:12:57,930 --> 04:12:58,290
Oh shoot.

5198
04:13:03,800 --> 04:13:04,300
Uh oh.

5199
04:13:04,460 --> 04:13:04,920
What are you doing?

5200
04:13:05,620 --> 04:13:06,140
You can?

5201
04:13:06,240 --> 04:13:07,320
You can't stop him from charging?

5202
04:13:11,670 --> 04:13:12,030
Boy!

5203
04:13:13,310 --> 04:13:13,670
Heh.

5204
04:13:13,670 --> 04:13:15,190
Letting theій put him bar, new power.

5205
04:13:15,750 --> 04:13:16,470
Oh my god.

5206
04:13:16,750 --> 04:13:17,110
Nooo!

5207
04:13:17,250 --> 04:13:17,610
Papary.

5208
04:13:18,490 --> 04:13:18,850
Yeah!

5209
04:13:25,870 --> 04:13:28,010
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

5210
04:13:34,310 --> 04:13:34,970
Okay, okay.

5211
04:13:35,270 --> 04:13:36,390
That's how much damage that does.

5212
04:13:39,690 --> 04:13:41,470
That's how much damage that does.

5213
04:13:42,570 --> 04:13:42,830
Yeah!

5214
04:14:08,500 --> 04:14:09,820
Oh, he's so far.

5215
04:14:10,140 --> 04:14:11,260
He's so far away.

5216
04:14:12,920 --> 04:14:13,600
You know what?

5217
04:14:13,760 --> 04:14:15,120
Actually, I will just leave him.

5218
04:14:16,260 --> 04:14:17,400
I don't want to risk it.

5219
04:14:17,620 --> 04:14:17,720
Okay.

5220
04:14:39,630 --> 04:14:41,470
Just a little bit more Dante.

5221
04:14:42,050 --> 04:14:43,070
Just a little bit more.

5222
04:14:43,610 --> 04:14:44,410
Come on, just get him.

5223
04:14:44,910 --> 04:14:45,630
Just get his ass.

5224
04:14:58,020 --> 04:14:58,460
Yeah!

5225
04:14:58,460 --> 04:14:59,420
What was happening?

5226
04:15:05,820 --> 04:15:06,260
Oh!

5227
04:15:06,260 --> 04:15:06,700
Trish!

5228
04:15:09,200 --> 04:15:10,000
Oh my god!

5229
04:15:10,280 --> 04:15:11,780
Be careful of her face!

5230
04:15:21,610 --> 04:15:23,450
Very god, Minto is real!

5231
04:15:23,650 --> 04:15:23,910
Yeah!

5232
04:15:25,110 --> 04:15:25,890
Thank you!

5233
04:15:27,410 --> 04:15:28,090
Trish!

5234
04:15:33,290 --> 04:15:35,270
Are we gonna be a speed demon now?

5235
04:15:35,530 --> 04:15:37,510
Or maybe a speed devil?

5236
04:15:38,370 --> 04:15:39,050
WAAAHHHHH!

5237
04:15:39,890 --> 04:15:41,030
S-sorry.

5238
04:15:44,950 --> 04:15:48,070
I didn't even- I-I-I didn't even- Oh god!

5239
04:15:48,570 --> 04:15:48,650
Dante!

5240
04:15:53,410 --> 04:15:54,890
Take care of Trish for me!

5241
04:15:56,130 --> 04:15:57,050
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

5242
04:15:57,530 --> 04:15:58,430
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

5243
04:15:58,670 --> 04:16:01,550
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

5244
04:16:01,550 --> 04:16:02,450
See you later, V.

5245
04:16:02,690 --> 04:16:03,630
You can't keep up.

5246
04:16:03,850 --> 04:16:05,550
This poor guy, help him up at least.

5247
04:16:05,550 --> 04:16:06,670
Booty shot!

5248
04:16:06,850 --> 04:16:07,690
Booty shot!

5249
04:16:11,570 --> 04:16:13,890
We leave you here with the naked lady.

5250
04:16:15,370 --> 04:16:18,850
The game is- is... st-stuttering.

5251
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:26,520
So now we got lady back, we got Trish back.

5252
04:16:26,520 --> 04:16:26,540
Look.

5253
04:16:28,660 --> 04:16:30,280
She looks so stiff.

5254
04:16:39,080 --> 04:16:40,340
What do you mean?

5255
04:16:40,380 --> 04:16:44,280
I took that guy down in one try.

5256
04:16:52,300 --> 04:16:53,260
Oh, yeah?

5257
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:54,600
So he's not a demon?

5258
04:16:57,280 --> 04:16:58,420
What are you, then?

5259
04:16:59,380 --> 04:17:00,340
It doesn't matter.

5260
04:17:01,260 --> 04:17:04,160
I'm a shadow of my former self who lost everything.

5261
04:17:07,520 --> 04:17:10,860
I will tell you the story of my birth.

5262
04:17:11,380 --> 04:17:11,760
Oh.

5263
04:17:12,680 --> 04:17:13,120
Okay.

5264
04:17:13,340 --> 04:17:13,900
We just met.

5265
04:17:16,580 --> 04:17:17,780
We just met.

5266
04:17:18,620 --> 04:17:19,140
Okay.

5267
04:17:19,480 --> 04:17:19,800
Oh, no.

5268
04:17:19,860 --> 04:17:21,340
Do I have to play as V again now?

5269
04:17:23,520 --> 04:17:25,380
Do I have to play as V now?

5270
04:17:25,380 --> 04:17:25,560
Oh.

5271
04:17:28,780 --> 04:17:29,740
Cavalier.

5272
04:17:33,540 --> 04:17:36,280
Is it Cavalier Angelo?

5273
04:17:36,580 --> 04:17:37,760
Fused with a motorbike.

5274
04:17:38,440 --> 04:17:41,500
Creating twin blades wielded from the bike's handlebars.

5275
04:17:42,760 --> 04:17:43,720
Cavalier.

5276
04:17:43,980 --> 04:17:44,760
Cavali-ray.

5277
04:17:45,260 --> 04:17:46,440
Let's go.

5278
04:17:47,400 --> 04:17:52,600
Many of Cavalier's attacks inflict continuous damage from the rotation of the wheels.

5279
04:17:53,140 --> 04:17:55,260
Chain attacks and connect with...

5280
04:17:55,260 --> 04:18:00,280
Chain attacks and connect with spinning wheels to take advantage of all this weapon has to offer.

5281
04:18:01,760 --> 04:18:04,740
Remember when Dante first met Trish, she threw a motorcycle...

5282
04:18:04,740 --> 04:18:05,560
You're right!

5283
04:18:09,180 --> 04:18:12,200
I want to know more about you, V.

5284
04:18:12,200 --> 04:18:14,020
A few weeks ago.

5285
04:18:14,280 --> 04:18:14,560
Oh my god.

5286
04:18:14,740 --> 04:18:15,060
He's just...

5287
04:18:15,060 --> 04:18:15,960
He's a literal baby.

5288
04:18:16,340 --> 04:18:16,920
Suffering defeat after defeat.

5289
04:18:17,200 --> 04:18:19,600
That man's body was reaching its limit.

5290
04:18:20,300 --> 04:18:21,240
Breaking down.

5291
04:18:22,220 --> 04:18:22,780
But...

5292
04:18:22,780 --> 04:18:23,500
They were just born.

5293
04:18:23,500 --> 04:18:24,060
He couldn't die yet.

5294
04:18:24,480 --> 04:18:27,100
The man had a job that must be done.

5295
04:18:27,800 --> 04:18:29,320
Oh, that man from before!

5296
04:18:29,720 --> 04:18:30,260
To defeat...

5297
04:18:30,260 --> 04:18:31,500
His twin brother.

5298
04:18:31,660 --> 04:18:32,160
Virgil!

5299
04:18:32,500 --> 04:18:33,660
I mean, not Virgil.

5300
04:18:33,860 --> 04:18:34,660
It's gotta be Virgil.

5301
04:18:35,100 --> 04:18:35,980
Ha ha ha ha ha.

5302
04:18:40,820 --> 04:18:41,380
Dante.

5303
04:18:47,950 --> 04:18:49,590
Definitely not Virgil.

5304
04:18:51,130 --> 04:18:52,030
Oh gosh.

5305
04:18:52,130 --> 04:18:52,550
Is he okay?

5306
04:18:52,930 --> 04:18:54,090
He's like a porcelain doll.

5307
04:18:56,330 --> 04:18:58,790
He's one of those haunted dolls you can buy off of eBay.

5308
04:18:58,970 --> 04:19:00,910
It's their home that burned down!

5309
04:19:02,010 --> 04:19:02,590
Aww.

5310
04:19:03,710 --> 04:19:04,890
I'm so sad.

5311
04:19:06,810 --> 04:19:07,390
Oh!

5312
04:19:10,350 --> 04:19:12,530
You don't have to prove anything to anybody, buddy.

5313
04:19:13,710 --> 04:19:15,090
That does.

5314
04:19:15,190 --> 04:19:15,910
Freeze.

5315
04:19:16,830 --> 04:19:16,990
My.

5316
04:19:17,770 --> 04:19:24,690
In order to defeat his younger brother, he could only do one thing with the crumbling flesh and feelings.

5317
04:19:24,970 --> 04:19:29,630
He needed to separate man from devil with the strength of the Yamato.

5318
04:19:33,250 --> 04:19:34,370
Shut up.

5319
04:19:34,710 --> 04:19:34,770
Imagine me.

5320
04:19:35,330 --> 04:19:37,430
The man became a true devil.

5321
04:19:39,710 --> 04:19:40,970
Shut up!

5322
04:19:42,730 --> 04:19:45,590
He gave birth to V.

5323
04:19:46,030 --> 04:19:47,170
Ha ha ha ha.

5324
04:19:48,430 --> 04:19:49,210
V.

5325
04:19:49,550 --> 04:19:50,190
Virgil!

5326
04:19:51,090 --> 04:19:51,870
V...

5327
04:19:51,870 --> 04:19:52,110
Vir...

5328
04:19:52,110 --> 04:19:52,530
V...

5329
04:19:52,530 --> 04:19:55,890
Wait, so now without the V, we're fighting Urgil?

5330
04:19:56,790 --> 04:19:57,490
You're...

5331
04:19:57,490 --> 04:19:57,930
Ha ha ha!

5332
04:19:58,190 --> 04:20:00,970
What little demonic power I have left, but...

5333
04:20:00,970 --> 04:20:02,130
Ha ha ha!

5334
04:20:02,130 --> 04:20:03,130
I'm approaching my...

5335
04:20:03,130 --> 04:20:04,130
Ha ha ha!

5336
04:20:09,150 --> 04:20:12,150
Ha ha ha!

5337
04:20:13,650 --> 04:20:16,670
Oh my god!

5338
04:20:41,410 --> 04:20:45,270
Wait, I need... I need him to, like, slick his hair back now.

5339
04:20:46,890 --> 04:20:50,630
Is that why his hair turns white when he uses the double trigger?

5340
04:20:51,110 --> 04:20:52,370
I'm not your mommy, Ray.

5341
04:21:01,850 --> 04:21:03,070
Got it, Trish.

5342
04:21:10,550 --> 04:21:12,290
I'm not over this revelation!

5343
04:21:12,750 --> 04:21:14,030
I'm not over it at all!

5344
04:21:15,470 --> 04:21:16,850
I'm not over it!

5345
04:21:40,470 --> 04:21:43,610
This is... This is so peak, Dante!

5346
04:21:46,530 --> 04:21:49,990
That was so... That was... My man's back, baby!

5347
04:21:52,690 --> 04:21:54,290
We got a new sword.

5348
04:21:54,590 --> 04:21:54,970
Oh boy.

5349
04:21:58,350 --> 04:21:59,870
We got a new sword.

5350
04:22:01,670 --> 04:22:03,330
Is there anything that I wanna get?

5351
04:22:03,690 --> 04:22:06,250
Let's see... Well, we could, um...

5352
04:22:06,250 --> 04:22:08,750
Wait, let's... What moves does this thing have?

5353
04:22:08,870 --> 04:22:09,990
On the ground... Oh!

5354
04:22:11,030 --> 04:22:11,510
Crossline!

5355
04:22:12,510 --> 04:22:14,350
Oh my god!

5356
04:22:18,960 --> 04:22:20,060
Slip stream!

5357
04:22:21,660 --> 04:22:22,880
Back to forward.

5358
04:22:23,140 --> 04:22:23,760
Oh, those ones are...

5359
04:22:23,760 --> 04:22:25,540
I'm so bad with those ones.

5360
04:22:27,500 --> 04:22:29,400
Trish just got trauma dumped.

5361
04:22:29,680 --> 04:22:31,640
And her response was, dude, who cares?

5362
04:22:34,140 --> 04:22:36,160
Just watch the clip of you and Doki yapping.

5363
04:22:36,380 --> 04:22:37,420
It reminds me of my best friend.

5364
04:22:38,600 --> 04:22:39,020
Yeah.

5365
04:22:40,160 --> 04:22:44,020
Virgil separated his human half and his demon half with the Yamato to become V and Urgil.

5366
04:22:44,400 --> 04:22:45,420
I can't!

5367
04:22:50,390 --> 04:22:51,870
I can't believe it!

5368
04:22:51,870 --> 04:22:53,110
That was so funny.

5369
04:23:03,360 --> 04:23:03,920
Urgil...

5370
04:23:03,920 --> 04:23:04,860
Let's see.

5371
04:23:05,140 --> 04:23:05,700
Mid arrow.

5372
04:23:08,380 --> 04:23:08,940
Wow.

5373
04:23:10,000 --> 04:23:11,620
I'm gonna... Let me actually...

5374
04:23:11,620 --> 04:23:14,020
Let me just try in this...

5375
04:23:14,020 --> 04:23:14,800
Uh...

5376
04:23:14,800 --> 04:23:15,340
In...

5377
04:23:15,340 --> 04:23:16,700
With this weapon in general.

5378
04:23:17,120 --> 04:23:18,200
Since it's completely new.

5379
04:23:18,700 --> 04:23:21,700
The bike is single-handedly the most entertaining weapon in the game.

5380
04:23:21,840 --> 04:23:22,740
There's no going back.

5381
04:23:25,800 --> 04:23:27,740
What do you... How does it... You work like normal.

5382
04:23:28,900 --> 04:23:29,900
Oh my god.

5383
04:23:30,100 --> 04:23:31,540
Oh, it's slow though.

5384
04:23:33,180 --> 04:23:36,500
Oh, it's really slow, but...

5385
04:23:37,300 --> 04:23:38,040
Never mind.

5386
04:23:38,200 --> 04:23:38,640
It's fast.

5387
04:23:39,420 --> 04:23:40,460
This is a little bike.

5388
04:23:41,440 --> 04:23:41,580
Ah!

5389
04:23:42,000 --> 04:23:42,500
Wait!

5390
04:23:51,140 --> 04:23:51,660
Eh...

5391
04:23:51,660 --> 04:23:51,860
Okay.

5392
04:23:56,430 --> 04:23:56,950
Wait.

5393
04:23:57,130 --> 04:23:57,930
What about...

5394
04:23:57,930 --> 04:23:58,790
Uh-oh.

5395
04:24:00,050 --> 04:24:00,570
Oh no.

5396
04:24:00,650 --> 04:24:01,250
Just a little different.

5397
04:24:01,650 --> 04:24:02,350
I think.

5398
04:24:02,630 --> 04:24:03,330
Actually, I can't go.

5399
04:24:06,410 --> 04:24:07,970
You can hold each hit.

5400
04:24:20,630 --> 04:24:23,330
It doesn't seem to change much of...

5401
04:24:24,170 --> 04:24:24,710
Uh...

5402
04:24:26,560 --> 04:24:28,680
It doesn't seem to change much though.

5403
04:24:28,860 --> 04:24:30,040
Like, if I hold it or not.

5404
04:24:36,140 --> 04:24:37,550
See, like that doesn't...

5405
04:24:38,680 --> 04:24:39,820
Just tap Y.

5406
04:24:41,660 --> 04:24:42,100
Oh!

5407
04:24:42,200 --> 04:24:42,640
Oh!

5408
04:24:42,860 --> 04:24:43,020
Oh!

5409
04:24:43,100 --> 04:24:43,200
Oh!

5410
04:24:43,200 --> 04:24:43,820
You mean like that.

5411
04:24:45,520 --> 04:24:46,600
So if I...

5412
04:24:46,600 --> 04:24:47,580
If I...

5413
04:24:48,460 --> 04:24:50,120
Do that instead...

5414
04:24:50,120 --> 04:24:50,820
Of doing...

5415
04:24:52,920 --> 04:24:53,360
I...

5416
04:24:58,760 --> 04:24:59,840
I get it.

5417
04:24:59,920 --> 04:25:00,300
I get it.

5418
04:25:03,400 --> 04:25:04,440
Let's try a different one.

5419
04:25:08,960 --> 04:25:11,780
If you mash Sword Master, you get to do donuts?

5420
04:25:12,060 --> 04:25:12,460
No way.

5421
04:25:12,600 --> 04:25:13,480
Wait, I wanna see the...

5422
04:25:13,480 --> 04:25:14,960
I wanna see like the mid-air things.

5423
04:25:18,200 --> 04:25:18,600
Press...

5424
04:25:18,600 --> 04:25:18,700
Oh.

5425
04:25:19,040 --> 04:25:19,140
L.

5426
04:25:19,880 --> 04:25:20,280
Okay.

5427
04:25:20,860 --> 04:25:21,260
Wait.

5428
04:25:26,200 --> 04:25:27,280
Oh, I forgot to jump.

5429
04:25:31,990 --> 04:25:32,510
Wait.

5430
04:25:32,610 --> 04:25:33,250
I'm gonna hold B.

5431
04:25:34,350 --> 04:25:34,870
Wait.

5432
04:25:34,970 --> 04:25:36,050
I tried doing B though.

5433
04:25:36,210 --> 04:25:36,290
Wait.

5434
04:25:40,310 --> 04:25:41,250
Where's my donuts?

5435
04:25:44,780 --> 04:25:46,100
I didn't do any donuts.

5436
04:25:46,100 --> 04:25:46,860
Which...

5437
04:25:48,900 --> 04:25:51,060
Dante has goggles on his neck from...

5438
04:25:51,060 --> 04:25:52,080
Wind Cavalier.

5439
04:25:52,360 --> 04:25:54,840
And in DT form, he wears them over his eyes.

5440
04:25:55,040 --> 04:25:56,000
That's so cute!

5441
04:25:56,360 --> 04:25:57,280
Wait, I don't see them.

5442
04:25:57,360 --> 04:25:58,020
Oh, I see them.

5443
04:25:59,780 --> 04:26:00,700
Oh, keep mashing.

5444
04:26:00,820 --> 04:26:00,980
That's right.

5445
04:26:01,100 --> 04:26:01,400
You said that.

5446
04:26:01,540 --> 04:26:01,580
Yeah.

5447
04:26:08,790 --> 04:26:09,650
Wait, am I...

5448
04:26:09,650 --> 04:26:09,790
Wait.

5449
04:26:10,490 --> 04:26:11,430
Should I not be...

5450
04:26:12,430 --> 04:26:13,790
Should I be holding something?

5451
04:26:14,050 --> 04:26:15,690
These are the weakest donuts I've ever seen.

5452
04:26:16,050 --> 04:26:16,690
Oh, lock on.

5453
04:26:16,870 --> 04:26:16,990
Okay.

5454
04:26:26,470 --> 04:26:27,590
Oh, there it is.

5455
04:26:27,650 --> 04:26:27,990
There it is.

5456
04:26:28,050 --> 04:26:28,350
There it is.

5457
04:26:28,450 --> 04:26:28,810
There it is.

5458
04:26:30,570 --> 04:26:32,530
I don't know if I need to hold the...

5459
04:26:32,530 --> 04:26:33,770
Left stick or not.

5460
04:26:35,390 --> 04:26:35,710
Woo!

5461
04:26:36,170 --> 04:26:36,410
Ew!

5462
04:26:52,970 --> 04:26:56,450
TGS 2018 Cavalier's concept art was shown where it could've...

5463
04:26:56,450 --> 04:26:57,610
Would've been called Emperor.

5464
04:26:58,150 --> 04:27:00,210
It would've been used by Nero instead of Dante.

5465
04:27:00,630 --> 04:27:02,310
Maybe next game you can find...

5466
04:27:07,420 --> 04:27:07,900
Oh my god.

5467
04:27:08,000 --> 04:27:08,360
I'm stuck.

5468
04:27:08,940 --> 04:27:09,080
Oh.

5469
04:27:16,140 --> 04:27:16,560
Okay.

5470
04:27:17,160 --> 04:27:18,240
I'll try it in battle.

5471
04:27:19,420 --> 04:27:19,820
We'll...

5472
04:27:19,820 --> 04:27:20,080
We'll see.

5473
04:27:27,000 --> 04:27:27,400
Okay.

5474
04:27:28,720 --> 04:27:30,460
I'm not gonna buy anything for it just yet.

5475
04:27:32,640 --> 04:27:33,400
I feel like...

5476
04:27:34,860 --> 04:27:35,480
Oh gosh.

5477
04:27:35,600 --> 04:27:38,900
Uh, this might be my last mission since my voice is starting to get a little icky.

5478
04:27:40,440 --> 04:27:41,400
Icky, icky, icky.

5479
04:27:42,560 --> 04:27:42,960
Uh...

5480
04:27:42,960 --> 04:27:43,560
Wait.

5481
04:27:43,700 --> 04:27:44,080
No, no.

5482
04:27:45,360 --> 04:27:45,760
Um...

5483
04:27:45,760 --> 04:27:48,380
I could buy Swordmaster...

5484
04:27:48,380 --> 04:27:49,580
Or...

5485
04:27:49,580 --> 04:27:51,240
Level four...

5486
04:27:51,240 --> 04:27:52,380
I could...

5487
04:27:58,270 --> 04:27:59,150
Well, yeah.

5488
04:27:59,290 --> 04:27:59,770
Maybe...

5489
04:27:59,770 --> 04:28:00,410
Since I...

5490
04:28:00,410 --> 04:28:00,870
Um...

5491
04:28:00,870 --> 04:28:01,850
We can...

5492
04:28:01,850 --> 04:28:03,850
I could just get Slipstream.

5493
04:28:04,010 --> 04:28:05,310
It's not so expensive.

5494
04:28:06,210 --> 04:28:08,190
And that's a move that I can do.

5495
04:28:11,090 --> 04:28:11,810
Swordmaster...

5496
04:28:11,810 --> 04:28:12,390
Four...

5497
04:28:14,070 --> 04:28:14,710
Four...

5498
04:28:14,710 --> 04:28:14,950
Un...

5499
04:28:14,950 --> 04:28:15,570
Four...

5500
04:28:15,570 --> 04:28:16,470
Unlock some...

5501
04:28:16,470 --> 04:28:17,190
Strong moves.

5502
04:28:17,450 --> 04:28:18,150
Well, um...

5503
04:28:18,150 --> 04:28:20,890
Now I don't have enough by literally 300 Rorbs.

5504
04:28:20,970 --> 04:28:21,430
But that's okay.

5505
04:28:21,830 --> 04:28:23,890
We'll get those 300 Rorbs...

5506
04:28:23,890 --> 04:28:24,510
Um...

5507
04:28:24,510 --> 04:28:24,930
Immediately.

5508
04:28:25,250 --> 04:28:25,550
Pretty much.

5509
04:28:27,490 --> 04:28:28,130
Yamato.

5510
04:28:33,390 --> 04:28:34,270
Just barely...

5511
04:28:34,270 --> 04:28:34,410
Oh.

5512
04:28:34,550 --> 04:28:34,730
Oh.

5513
04:28:49,780 --> 04:28:50,220
Woohoo!

5514
04:29:06,690 --> 04:29:07,130
Nice.

5515
04:29:07,550 --> 04:29:07,690
Oh.

5516
04:29:07,790 --> 04:29:08,150
You're here.

5517
04:29:08,830 --> 04:29:08,990
Oh, you're here.

5518
04:29:11,870 --> 04:29:13,430
Wait, why isn't it...

5519
04:29:13,430 --> 04:29:15,310
Doing the move that I just bought?

5520
04:29:16,770 --> 04:29:18,990
Hey, do the move that I just bought.

5521
04:29:20,230 --> 04:29:20,930
Oh well.

5522
04:29:28,690 --> 04:29:33,410
Wait, I bought the wrong... I bought the wrong one.

5523
04:29:39,460 --> 04:29:40,960
Well, time to try.

5524
04:29:47,940 --> 04:29:48,620
Like that?

5525
04:29:55,420 --> 04:29:57,040
Oh I'm stuck in here now with you.

5526
04:29:58,400 --> 04:30:00,400
Ew, I don't want to be stuck in here with you.

5527
04:30:00,880 --> 04:30:01,740
Like that.

5528
04:30:04,700 --> 04:30:05,380
Oopsie.

5529
04:30:06,280 --> 04:30:07,140
Whoopsie boopsie.

5530
04:30:11,160 --> 04:30:11,840
Ew.

5531
04:30:13,540 --> 04:30:14,880
That was it though.

5532
04:30:15,260 --> 04:30:15,800
Let's go.

5533
04:30:19,360 --> 04:30:20,280
Let's go.

5534
04:30:22,000 --> 04:30:22,980
Oh my god.

5535
04:30:45,600 --> 04:30:46,280
Nice.

5536
04:30:47,620 --> 04:30:48,220
I'm

5537
04:31:19,340 --> 04:31:20,200
gonna fight me.

5538
04:31:20,500 --> 04:31:21,800
Are you trying to attack him?

5539
04:31:28,620 --> 04:31:31,920
I'm doing like the least amount of style points.

5540
04:31:32,160 --> 04:31:36,500
But I think this is the most amount of style points in my heart.

5541
04:31:38,820 --> 04:31:41,600
This is the most style points in my heart.

5542
04:31:44,600 --> 04:31:46,200
Spin to win.

5543
04:31:50,060 --> 04:31:51,560
Are these gonna drop anything?

5544
04:31:53,300 --> 04:31:55,060
They just drop to the ground.

5545
04:31:55,380 --> 04:31:56,580
And then they rebuild.

5546
04:31:57,260 --> 04:31:58,540
It's like a metaphor.

5547
04:31:59,200 --> 04:32:00,140
For life.

5548
04:32:01,800 --> 04:32:04,760
When you drop to the ground, you just gotta rebuild yourself.

5549
04:32:07,700 --> 04:32:08,380
Ooh.

5550
04:32:08,540 --> 04:32:09,300
Pretty area.

5551
04:32:09,940 --> 04:32:11,820
It's been like almost untouched.

5552
04:32:14,100 --> 04:32:15,260
Wise words.

5553
04:32:16,180 --> 04:32:17,560
Be like... Whoops.

5554
04:32:18,260 --> 04:32:19,260
Don't be like me.

5555
04:32:19,540 --> 04:32:20,420
Have depth perception.

5556
04:32:20,680 --> 04:32:21,540
Be like...

5557
04:32:21,540 --> 04:32:24,060
Be like this overgrown monster city.

5558
04:32:27,480 --> 04:32:28,500
Oh nevermind.

5559
04:32:28,720 --> 04:32:29,420
That's a stoplight.

5560
04:32:31,140 --> 04:32:31,820
Nope.

5561
04:32:34,220 --> 04:32:34,900
Nope.

5562
04:32:40,400 --> 04:32:41,080
Nope.

5563
04:32:41,220 --> 04:32:42,000
I'm examining you.

5564
04:32:42,380 --> 04:32:44,300
I'm examin... Nope.

5565
04:32:44,760 --> 04:32:44,860
Nope.

5566
04:32:45,280 --> 04:32:45,560
Dante.

5567
04:32:45,880 --> 04:32:46,920
I'm examining you.

5568
04:32:48,280 --> 04:32:49,700
Is it puzzle time?

5569
04:32:50,020 --> 04:32:50,680
Oh my gosh.

5570
04:32:50,960 --> 04:32:51,520
Actual puzzle.

5571
04:32:52,300 --> 04:32:53,480
You need some blood, huh?

5572
04:32:54,420 --> 04:32:54,900
Sorry.

5573
04:32:55,240 --> 04:32:56,400
You wouldn't like mine.

5574
04:32:56,700 --> 04:32:58,020
You wouldn't like mine.

5575
04:33:01,440 --> 04:33:01,920
Wait.

5576
04:33:02,100 --> 04:33:03,760
How do I have a Nidhogg hatchling?

5577
04:33:03,900 --> 04:33:04,280
From where?

5578
04:33:05,340 --> 04:33:08,500
When did I... When did I... Wait.

5579
04:33:08,640 --> 04:33:09,740
There's blood all right here.

5580
04:33:09,900 --> 04:33:10,020
Wait.

5581
04:33:12,640 --> 04:33:13,120
Examine.

5582
04:33:15,800 --> 04:33:17,060
When did I grab that?

5583
04:33:18,620 --> 04:33:19,100
Oh.

5584
04:33:20,320 --> 04:33:21,500
I need to grab one.

5585
04:33:21,500 --> 04:33:22,040
Okay.

5586
04:33:22,400 --> 04:33:23,540
I was like... Wait a second.

5587
04:33:23,900 --> 04:33:24,880
I don't have that.

5588
04:33:26,120 --> 04:33:26,400
Yeah.

5589
04:33:26,900 --> 04:33:27,040
No.

5590
04:33:27,140 --> 04:33:27,420
No.

5591
04:33:27,560 --> 04:33:27,780
No.

5592
04:33:27,960 --> 04:33:28,080
No shit.

5593
04:33:29,080 --> 04:33:29,580
Come on.

5594
04:33:29,640 --> 04:33:29,800
Minto.

5595
04:33:29,820 --> 04:33:30,500
Use your brain.

5596
04:33:31,060 --> 04:33:32,160
It was just a prompt.

5597
04:33:34,400 --> 04:33:35,240
Oh guys.

5598
04:33:35,920 --> 04:33:36,560
VTuber's so dumb.

5599
04:33:36,680 --> 04:33:36,780
Right?

5600
04:33:38,520 --> 04:33:40,300
Can I get a... Yeah.

5601
04:33:45,820 --> 04:33:46,660
Think Minto.

5602
04:33:46,900 --> 04:33:47,180
Think.

5603
04:33:47,660 --> 04:33:47,880
Okay.

5604
04:33:47,960 --> 04:33:49,180
We gotta go find two of them.

5605
04:33:50,080 --> 04:33:50,620
Two of them.

5606
04:33:50,700 --> 04:33:51,020
Two of them.

5607
04:33:51,100 --> 04:33:51,420
Two of them.

5608
04:33:51,500 --> 04:33:51,820
Two of them.

5609
04:33:51,840 --> 04:33:52,220
Two of them.

5610
04:33:52,320 --> 04:33:52,620
Two of them.

5611
04:33:53,420 --> 04:33:54,000
Two of them.

5612
04:33:54,000 --> 04:33:54,440
Two of them.

5613
04:33:54,560 --> 04:33:54,880
Two of them.

5614
04:34:06,940 --> 04:34:08,140
There's a little guy.

5615
04:34:09,140 --> 04:34:09,200
Oh.

5616
04:34:10,980 --> 04:34:11,560
Grab.

5617
04:34:14,090 --> 04:34:15,130
Don't be super smart.

5618
04:34:15,150 --> 04:34:15,890
She has glasses.

5619
04:34:16,610 --> 04:34:16,810
True.

5620
04:34:18,390 --> 04:34:19,330
So true.

5621
04:34:19,770 --> 04:34:20,050
Thank you.

5622
04:34:29,120 --> 04:34:31,540
We'll use this one first.

5623
04:34:32,700 --> 04:34:34,640
Which one gives me a second one?

5624
04:34:36,000 --> 04:34:37,180
Or do they both?

5625
04:34:39,000 --> 04:34:40,780
Which one should I go through first?

5626
04:34:47,570 --> 04:34:48,210
Either one.

5627
04:34:48,310 --> 04:34:48,670
Doesn't matter.

5628
04:34:48,910 --> 04:34:48,970
Oh.

5629
04:34:49,810 --> 04:34:51,890
This area reminds me of something DMC1.

5630
04:34:52,590 --> 04:34:53,070
Oh.

5631
04:34:53,470 --> 04:34:56,550
There... I know exactly what area you're talking about.

5632
04:34:56,810 --> 04:34:57,050
Brandon.

5633
04:34:57,250 --> 04:34:57,990
In DMC1.

5634
04:34:58,170 --> 04:35:00,010
It does remind me of that area too.

5635
04:35:00,530 --> 04:35:01,810
Now that you mention it.

5636
04:35:08,780 --> 04:35:09,260
Alrighty.

5637
04:35:09,380 --> 04:35:10,020
Here we go.

5638
04:35:10,320 --> 04:35:10,320
Oh.

5639
04:35:11,860 --> 04:35:12,440
Yeah.

5640
04:35:12,600 --> 04:35:15,820
There was that area where... I think it was the dogs first appeared.

5641
04:35:16,560 --> 04:35:16,840
No.

5642
04:35:17,140 --> 04:35:17,320
Yeah.

5643
04:35:17,660 --> 04:35:18,180
Wait.

5644
04:35:18,360 --> 04:35:22,660
It was like a razor... It was something... It was something razor-like and like flying through the air.

5645
04:35:22,920 --> 04:35:23,700
I remember.

5646
04:35:24,260 --> 04:35:27,180
That area was... It was tough.

5647
04:35:27,700 --> 04:35:28,760
I remember.

5648
04:35:51,000 --> 04:35:51,400
Oh.

5649
04:35:51,620 --> 04:35:51,760
Oh.

5650
04:35:52,160 --> 04:35:52,160
Oh.

5651
04:35:52,560 --> 04:35:52,760
Oh.

5652
04:35:53,700 --> 04:35:55,500
I'm not gonna let you drink their blood.

5653
04:36:02,320 --> 04:36:02,720
Yeah.

5654
04:36:02,800 --> 04:36:03,580
That fight sucked.

5655
04:36:04,100 --> 04:36:04,420
Wait.

5656
04:36:04,700 --> 04:36:05,620
There's blood right there.

5657
04:36:05,800 --> 04:36:05,940
Wait.

5658
04:36:06,040 --> 04:36:06,720
Don't let her drink it.

5659
04:36:06,940 --> 04:36:07,800
Don't let her drink it.

5660
04:36:08,200 --> 04:36:08,920
Come on, Dante.

5661
04:36:09,120 --> 04:36:09,780
Don't let her drink it.

5662
04:36:10,120 --> 04:36:10,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5663
04:36:10,720 --> 04:36:11,400
Don't let her drink it.

5664
04:36:11,600 --> 04:36:12,380
Don't let her drink it.

5665
04:36:12,800 --> 04:36:13,160
Wait.

5666
04:36:18,110 --> 04:36:18,990
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

5667
04:36:28,720 --> 04:36:29,080
This

5668
04:36:47,920 --> 04:36:54,310
is such a silly... Yeah!

5669
04:36:54,710 --> 04:36:55,490
Ooh, I parried that.

5670
04:36:56,030 --> 04:36:56,430
Let's go.

5671
04:37:07,090 --> 04:37:08,330
Gosh, dang.

5672
04:37:08,330 --> 04:37:08,570
Dang.

5673
04:37:13,420 --> 04:37:15,780
Actually, I don't even know if she would drink that up.

5674
04:37:16,300 --> 04:37:17,160
I don't even know.

5675
04:37:17,400 --> 04:37:18,000
What is this?

5676
04:37:18,120 --> 04:37:18,700
What is that?

5677
04:37:19,340 --> 04:37:20,480
Just some gunk.

5678
04:37:21,320 --> 04:37:22,960
Maybe it wasn't blood after all.

5679
04:37:23,800 --> 04:37:24,980
It's a silly weapon.

5680
04:37:25,600 --> 04:37:26,560
There it is.

5681
04:37:28,540 --> 04:37:29,100
Who?

5682
04:37:32,470 --> 04:37:32,950
Oh.

5683
04:37:39,140 --> 04:37:40,420
Hey, chill out.

5684
04:37:49,050 --> 04:37:51,270
Yeah, you wanna fight this?

5685
04:37:51,670 --> 04:37:53,030
Fire beats ice.

5686
04:38:03,700 --> 04:38:04,060
Baby!

5687
04:38:04,060 --> 04:38:04,420
Exactly!

5688
04:38:09,630 --> 04:38:11,050
Oh, it just respawns.

5689
04:38:11,210 --> 04:38:11,830
Okay, that's fine.

5690
04:38:15,550 --> 04:38:17,250
I think that's all I had left in here.

5691
04:38:21,520 --> 04:38:22,920
And then we can get this guy.

5692
04:38:23,140 --> 04:38:24,080
Wait, is this where I came?

5693
04:38:24,140 --> 04:38:25,060
No, this is not where I came from.

5694
04:38:27,420 --> 04:38:31,880
I came from... This way?

5695
04:38:33,640 --> 04:38:34,000
Yeah.

5696
04:38:34,480 --> 04:38:34,760
Oh, God.

5697
04:38:35,700 --> 04:38:39,580
We are going the correct way.

5698
04:38:40,220 --> 04:38:40,560
We are going the correct way.

5699
04:38:40,560 --> 04:38:40,860
Oh, whoa.

5700
04:38:41,040 --> 04:38:42,980
That's... That was... That kind of sucked.

5701
04:38:45,300 --> 04:38:47,640
We are going the correct way.

5702
04:38:49,280 --> 04:38:49,920
Yeah!

5703
04:38:50,300 --> 04:38:50,640
Yeah!

5704
04:38:52,140 --> 04:38:54,200
So many warbs!

5705
04:38:54,500 --> 04:38:55,520
Holy moly.

5706
04:38:55,820 --> 04:38:55,860
Oh.

5707
04:39:06,670 --> 04:39:08,390
That leads back.

5708
04:39:08,710 --> 04:39:10,110
And this leads to...

5709
04:39:10,110 --> 04:39:11,610
If I follow these grooves...

5710
04:39:12,530 --> 04:39:13,290
Grooves?

5711
04:39:14,250 --> 04:39:16,390
When it down, smack it.

5712
04:39:16,510 --> 04:39:19,570
So true.

5713
04:39:20,970 --> 04:39:21,390
Oh!

5714
04:39:22,370 --> 04:39:23,570
I see.

5715
04:39:23,850 --> 04:39:24,350
I see.

5716
04:39:28,210 --> 04:39:31,930
With bees' revelation, does the bird and panther summon look familiar to you.

5717
04:39:34,290 --> 04:39:37,750
Like a certain bird boss and spiky panther from DMC.

5718
04:39:37,970 --> 04:39:38,390
What?

5719
04:39:39,050 --> 04:39:39,430
Oh!

5720
04:39:40,690 --> 04:39:42,670
Well, I guess when you mention it...

5721
04:39:46,020 --> 04:39:47,400
When you mention it...

5722
04:39:55,800 --> 04:39:56,400
Okay.

5723
04:39:56,400 --> 04:39:56,840
Yep.

5724
04:39:57,420 --> 04:39:58,820
Here comes the blood.

5725
04:39:59,140 --> 04:40:01,020
Here comes the blood.

5726
04:40:01,360 --> 04:40:02,380
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

5727
04:40:02,760 --> 04:40:04,740
Here comes the blood.

5728
04:40:04,740 --> 04:40:06,400
And I say...

5729
04:40:08,300 --> 04:40:08,620
Um...

5730
04:40:08,940 --> 04:40:09,160
Oh!

5731
04:40:12,460 --> 04:40:13,100
Porb.

5732
04:40:15,340 --> 04:40:16,580
That's what I say.

5733
04:40:17,060 --> 04:40:18,260
I've always said that.

5734
04:40:18,520 --> 04:40:19,500
That's like my motto.

5735
04:40:20,080 --> 04:40:22,260
Ever since I debuted, I've always been like...

5736
04:40:22,260 --> 04:40:23,360
Porb.

5737
04:40:25,100 --> 04:40:25,520
Oh!

5738
04:40:26,160 --> 04:40:26,720
This is what...

5739
04:40:26,720 --> 04:40:27,080
Aha.

5740
04:40:27,500 --> 04:40:27,840
I see.

5741
04:40:28,000 --> 04:40:28,260
I see.

5742
04:40:33,740 --> 04:40:35,100
Yeah, I've always said that.

5743
04:40:39,400 --> 04:40:39,820
Then...

5744
04:40:39,820 --> 04:40:43,100
You know, I've never played Devil May Cry before, but...

5745
04:40:43,100 --> 04:40:45,240
When I debuted, I was just like...

5746
04:40:45,720 --> 04:40:47,780
I was like, I just feel this connection.

5747
04:40:49,180 --> 04:40:51,400
This connection to the word Porb.

5748
04:40:53,740 --> 04:40:54,960
The trees.

5749
04:40:55,320 --> 04:40:55,820
The trees.

5750
04:40:59,450 --> 04:40:59,840
Oh.

5751
04:41:00,180 --> 04:41:00,660
Uh-oh.

5752
04:41:03,020 --> 04:41:03,800
Oh!

5753
04:41:04,040 --> 04:41:04,340
Oh!

5754
04:41:05,600 --> 04:41:07,140
Oh, I don't like that.

5755
04:41:07,680 --> 04:41:08,620
It's Porb.

5756
04:41:08,620 --> 04:41:10,180
Worst enemy incoming.

5757
04:41:12,620 --> 04:41:14,540
Hard but fun enemy.

5758
04:41:14,980 --> 04:41:15,520
Oh, boy.

5759
04:41:20,750 --> 04:41:21,530
Bang!

5760
04:41:21,530 --> 04:41:22,190
Bang!

5761
04:41:22,610 --> 04:41:22,750
Bang!

5762
04:41:22,750 --> 04:41:22,990
Bang.

5763
04:41:25,610 --> 04:41:26,890
You get him.

5764
04:41:33,790 --> 04:41:34,610
Fury.

5765
04:41:36,070 --> 04:41:40,790
I have a PTSD with an enemy of that name.

5766
04:41:46,790 --> 04:41:47,810
Where is he?

5767
04:41:48,130 --> 04:41:48,250
Oh.

5768
04:41:56,110 --> 04:41:57,310
Oh my gosh.

5769
04:41:57,890 --> 04:41:58,390
Oh my gosh.

5770
04:42:00,670 --> 04:42:01,490
Yeah.

5771
04:42:03,610 --> 04:42:04,750
Oh shoot.

5772
04:42:06,390 --> 04:42:07,970
Oh, get up, Dante.

5773
04:42:07,970 --> 04:42:08,190
Okay.

5774
04:42:08,370 --> 04:42:08,650
Okay.

5775
04:42:08,870 --> 04:42:21,030
Maybe, maybe, uh... Maybe, uh... Maybe, uh... Maybe, uh... Maybe, uh... Oh my gosh.

5776
04:42:26,530 --> 04:42:27,650
What the hell?

5777
04:42:28,730 --> 04:42:29,430
Wait,

5778
04:42:34,210 --> 04:42:34,510
please.

5779
04:42:35,030 --> 04:42:36,290
Go back to...

5780
04:42:39,210 --> 04:42:39,770
No.

5781
04:42:40,070 --> 04:42:40,490
Ah!

5782
04:42:45,740 --> 04:42:46,840
Oh my god.

5783
04:42:47,200 --> 04:42:48,120
Excuse me.

5784
04:42:49,820 --> 04:42:50,380
Please.

5785
04:42:50,600 --> 04:42:50,760
Please.

5786
04:42:51,020 --> 04:42:51,580
Oh, there we go.

5787
04:42:52,200 --> 04:42:53,460
Oh, I got his ass.

5788
04:42:53,580 --> 04:42:53,740
No.

5789
04:42:54,740 --> 04:42:55,200
Oh.

5790
04:42:56,800 --> 04:43:05,980
I wasn't... I wasn't even focusing on him because I was trying so hard to... Get back into, uh... Into punching mode.

5791
04:43:06,220 --> 04:43:07,720
That's all I wanted to do.

5792
04:43:07,720 --> 04:43:08,420
Hahaha.

5793
04:43:09,120 --> 04:43:10,780
I wasn't even looking at him.

5794
04:43:11,020 --> 04:43:12,460
I was just like, okay, I need to go back.

5795
04:43:12,520 --> 04:43:13,640
I want to go into punching mode.

5796
04:43:13,800 --> 04:43:15,800
And I couldn't... I couldn't get to it.

5797
04:43:16,360 --> 04:43:16,800
Hahaha.

5798
04:43:17,600 --> 04:43:22,060
But in the end... DT'ing is, uh... Oh.

5799
04:43:25,820 --> 04:43:27,240
Is, uh, what helps.

5800
04:43:29,540 --> 04:43:31,500
You need to parry him to get good hits.

5801
04:43:32,080 --> 04:43:33,680
Yeah, I could kind of tell.

5802
04:43:34,760 --> 04:43:37,640
He was, like, that type, you know, but...

5803
04:43:38,340 --> 04:43:41,420
In the end... It's all good.

5804
04:43:42,100 --> 04:43:44,500
How do I... How... How do I get it?

5805
04:43:44,720 --> 04:43:45,620
Oh my gosh.

5806
04:43:45,740 --> 04:43:46,980
If only I had a grabby-grab.

5807
04:43:49,260 --> 04:43:50,880
And then we are all satisfied.

5808
04:43:51,220 --> 04:43:51,440
Exactly.

5809
04:43:56,060 --> 04:43:56,580
Squeeze.

5810
04:43:56,980 --> 04:43:58,380
Dante can make it through there.

5811
04:43:58,560 --> 04:43:59,400
I'm not gonna lie.

5812
04:43:59,720 --> 04:44:00,940
He's just being lazy.

5813
04:44:01,380 --> 04:44:01,680
Hahaha.

5814
04:44:03,120 --> 04:44:04,440
He's just being lazy.

5815
04:44:05,320 --> 04:44:07,540
I was hoping I could just follow the groove.

5816
04:44:07,820 --> 04:44:09,900
But they're not making any sense of it.

5817
04:44:10,940 --> 04:44:11,500
Dang.

5818
04:44:12,320 --> 04:44:12,740
Okay.

5819
04:44:13,800 --> 04:44:18,760
What the... Is it that thing?

5820
04:44:21,380 --> 04:44:21,800
Hahaha.

5821
04:44:22,640 --> 04:44:23,200
Hmm?

5822
04:44:23,800 --> 04:44:24,740
Is it that thing?

5823
04:44:28,240 --> 04:44:29,360
What is that thing?

5824
04:44:29,900 --> 04:44:30,580
Oh my gosh!

5825
04:44:31,020 --> 04:44:32,240
Oh, it's this thing.

5826
04:44:35,220 --> 04:44:35,920
Oh my god.

5827
04:44:36,060 --> 04:44:36,660
Oh my god!

5828
04:44:36,760 --> 04:44:37,240
It's a nest!

5829
04:44:37,460 --> 04:44:37,960
Oh my gosh!

5830
04:44:38,040 --> 04:44:38,220
Wait.

5831
04:44:38,480 --> 04:44:39,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5832
04:44:39,480 --> 04:44:40,000
Wait, wait, wait.

5833
04:44:40,020 --> 04:44:40,540
I'm not ready.

5834
04:44:40,920 --> 04:44:41,780
Oh my gosh, a nest.

5835
04:44:49,400 --> 04:44:50,340
Nope, nope, nope.

5836
04:44:50,480 --> 04:44:51,240
I'm not letting...

5837
04:44:51,240 --> 04:44:51,520
No!

5838
04:44:52,660 --> 04:44:52,980
No!

5839
04:44:55,500 --> 04:44:57,000
I'm not letting you...

5840
04:44:57,900 --> 04:44:58,340
Even...

5841
04:44:58,340 --> 04:44:59,420
Even attempt.

5842
04:45:01,640 --> 04:45:04,240
I think this is our first time actually fighting this.

5843
04:45:04,580 --> 04:45:05,420
Oh my gosh.

5844
04:45:05,660 --> 04:45:06,040
Oh my gosh.

5845
04:45:06,340 --> 04:45:08,220
It's our first time like actually fighting this.

5846
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:09,680
No, I did not mean to grab that.

5847
04:45:09,920 --> 04:45:10,340
Oh my gosh.

5848
04:45:48,300 --> 04:45:49,440
Can I get rid of this guy?

5849
04:45:50,380 --> 04:45:51,060
There we go.

5850
04:45:51,420 --> 04:45:51,600
Okay.

5851
04:46:06,060 --> 04:46:06,500
Easy.

5852
04:46:10,200 --> 04:46:12,320
I really like...

5853
04:46:12,320 --> 04:46:13,960
Having the fists.

5854
04:46:15,580 --> 04:46:16,980
I didn't like...

5855
04:46:16,980 --> 04:46:18,760
I didn't like Beowulf so much.

5856
04:46:18,900 --> 04:46:20,480
But these ones...

5857
04:46:21,620 --> 04:46:24,660
These ones make it hard to say no, you know?

5858
04:46:25,060 --> 04:46:27,380
These ones make it hard for me to...

5859
04:46:30,960 --> 04:46:32,340
Strange camera angle.

5860
04:46:36,080 --> 04:46:39,800
Yeah, we'll have to get Swordmaster level 4 once...

5861
04:46:41,120 --> 04:46:41,800
Once...

5862
04:46:42,500 --> 04:46:43,180
Once...

5863
04:46:43,180 --> 04:46:44,760
I find a statue.

5864
04:46:45,980 --> 04:46:46,320
I guess...

5865
04:46:46,320 --> 04:46:47,820
I guess Dante doesn't know Nico.

5866
04:46:48,200 --> 04:46:49,640
So he wouldn't know to call her.

5867
04:46:51,360 --> 04:46:54,120
How does Nero know Nico?

5868
04:47:09,500 --> 04:47:10,240
Something, something...

5869
04:47:10,240 --> 04:47:11,680
Don't want to keep Mr. Demon King waiting.

5870
04:47:12,360 --> 04:47:13,360
Gotta pick up the base.

5871
04:47:13,640 --> 04:47:15,700
Something, something pre-DMC...

5872
04:47:17,140 --> 04:47:17,980
Five novels.

5873
04:47:18,120 --> 04:47:18,920
There's novels?

5874
04:47:20,540 --> 04:47:22,040
Oh, I didn't know that.

5875
04:47:22,640 --> 04:47:23,260
Wait, can I...

5876
04:47:23,260 --> 04:47:24,820
Okay, there's no holes I can jump through.

5877
04:47:26,940 --> 04:47:28,480
I guess I can go in through here.

5878
04:47:41,200 --> 04:47:42,800
Is this how I get to the...

5879
04:47:42,800 --> 04:47:43,840
To the board?

5880
04:47:44,760 --> 04:47:45,800
Yes, it is.

5881
04:47:46,020 --> 04:47:46,840
Yes, it is.

5882
04:47:46,840 --> 04:47:47,320
Oh, there's...

5883
04:47:47,840 --> 04:47:49,220
Oh...

5884
04:47:49,220 --> 04:47:51,760
This is how we get to the Bloorb.

5885
04:47:52,500 --> 04:47:53,100
Nice.

5886
04:47:55,840 --> 04:47:58,320
One full Bloorb!

5887
04:48:00,260 --> 04:48:00,740
Yippee!

5888
04:48:01,360 --> 04:48:02,080
Alrighty.

5889
04:48:03,940 --> 04:48:04,900
Uh...

5890
04:48:04,900 --> 04:48:05,860
Wait, where's the exit?

5891
04:48:09,040 --> 04:48:10,000
Uh...

5892
04:48:10,000 --> 04:48:11,100
Dante, where was the exit?

5893
04:48:16,080 --> 04:48:16,560
Oh.

5894
04:48:17,020 --> 04:48:17,300
Oh.

5895
04:48:20,260 --> 04:48:21,760
I found it.

5896
04:48:23,200 --> 04:48:24,500
We're fine.

5897
04:48:27,940 --> 04:48:29,260
We're okay.

5898
04:48:34,940 --> 04:48:35,860
Okay.

5899
04:48:39,260 --> 04:48:40,180
Nice.

5900
04:48:41,140 --> 04:48:41,800
Full.

5901
04:48:42,680 --> 04:48:43,600
Deviled.

5902
04:48:45,000 --> 04:48:45,920
Perfect.

5903
04:48:46,580 --> 04:48:48,940
Okay, let's just... Warp.

5904
04:48:48,980 --> 04:48:49,840
Not even just a warp.

5905
04:48:49,960 --> 04:48:50,880
It's a warp tree.

5906
04:48:52,980 --> 04:48:53,900
Oh, oh my gosh.

5907
04:48:54,080 --> 04:48:59,860
I don't know why I didn't think there would be a... Stop

5908
04:49:26,380 --> 04:49:27,240
freezing me.

5909
04:49:28,880 --> 04:49:30,100
Don't do that again.

5910
04:49:33,640 --> 04:49:35,280
Yeah, don't do that again.

5911
04:49:35,560 --> 04:49:36,200
Don't do that again.

5912
04:49:36,560 --> 04:49:37,240
Don't do that again.

5913
04:49:37,680 --> 04:49:38,560
Don't do that again.

5914
04:49:39,180 --> 04:49:42,460
I'll make it so you never have the chance to do it again.

5915
04:49:43,840 --> 04:49:44,460
Alright.

5916
04:49:48,290 --> 04:49:48,430
Oh.

5917
04:49:48,550 --> 04:49:49,030
Oh, shoot.

5918
04:49:49,350 --> 04:49:50,170
I was getting it.

5919
04:49:54,550 --> 04:49:55,170
Woohoo!

5920
04:50:20,860 --> 04:50:21,680
Yip, yip.

5921
04:50:25,880 --> 04:50:26,500
Cool.

5922
04:50:29,720 --> 04:50:30,340
Alright.

5923
04:50:30,680 --> 04:50:31,300
More blood.

5924
04:50:31,820 --> 04:50:33,680
More blood for the blood god.

5925
04:50:33,680 --> 04:50:34,140
Oh, my gosh.

5926
04:50:44,140 --> 04:50:44,660
Corb.

5927
04:50:46,240 --> 04:50:50,840
I like how you find secret passages that I missed while not seeing obvious big corridors.

5928
04:50:51,580 --> 04:50:53,840
It's my... It's my special talent.

5929
04:50:56,340 --> 04:50:57,860
It's my... Don't worry about it.

5930
04:50:57,960 --> 04:50:59,040
It's just, you know...

5931
04:51:00,100 --> 04:51:01,500
It's my special talent.

5932
04:51:02,820 --> 04:51:04,920
What, there's one more that we need, I think?

5933
04:51:05,140 --> 04:51:06,760
One more blood puddle?

5934
04:51:06,760 --> 04:51:08,780
One more...

5935
04:51:10,530 --> 04:51:12,930
The VTuber experience?

5936
04:51:15,010 --> 04:51:16,790
That should be all of them.

5937
04:51:16,930 --> 04:51:17,450
Just kidding.

5938
04:51:17,630 --> 04:51:18,510
That's all of them.

5939
04:51:19,890 --> 04:51:22,410
It's been a while since I used my brain this much.

5940
04:51:25,790 --> 04:51:26,770
Oh, Dante.

5941
04:51:26,770 --> 04:51:28,470
You really are just like me.

5942
04:51:29,330 --> 04:51:30,830
Ghost gamer skills.

5943
04:51:37,640 --> 04:51:39,300
Dante is too real.

5944
04:51:40,420 --> 04:51:41,740
He is too...

5945
04:51:41,740 --> 04:51:43,220
He's too real.

5946
04:51:46,640 --> 04:51:48,500
Just like me, for real, for real.

5947
04:51:56,560 --> 04:51:58,700
Okay, we gotta make it to...

5948
04:52:00,400 --> 04:52:02,240
Oh, so close.

5949
04:52:03,300 --> 04:52:05,360
Imagine if there was fall damage in this camp.

5950
04:52:16,740 --> 04:52:17,320
Gorb.

5951
04:52:20,300 --> 04:52:21,400
Insert the baby.

5952
04:52:26,970 --> 04:52:28,990
The baby causes mold.

5953
04:52:32,090 --> 04:52:33,610
Is this...

5954
04:52:34,870 --> 04:52:35,630
Uh...

5955
04:52:36,510 --> 04:52:37,930
What is this?

5956
04:52:38,470 --> 04:52:39,530
Where are we going?

5957
04:52:39,830 --> 04:52:40,370
Oh my goodness.

5958
04:52:41,190 --> 04:52:41,550
Seriously?

5959
04:52:42,050 --> 04:52:42,610
Where?

5960
04:52:42,990 --> 04:52:43,230
Oops.

5961
04:52:49,150 --> 04:52:51,070
You wish to fight me!

5962
04:52:54,010 --> 04:52:55,490
You wish to fight me!

5963
04:52:56,070 --> 04:52:58,090
You wish to try and attack me!

5964
04:52:58,670 --> 04:53:00,230
Oh, he did...

5965
04:53:00,230 --> 04:53:02,630
Oh, he did...

5966
04:53:02,630 --> 04:53:05,830
Oh yeah, he did...

5967
04:53:07,290 --> 04:53:08,090
Oh.

5968
04:53:08,450 --> 04:53:09,210
I-YOU!

5969
04:53:09,210 --> 04:53:10,150
Yeah, no.

5970
04:53:11,570 --> 04:53:12,770
You, then you.

5971
04:53:13,130 --> 04:53:16,170
Then, you, then you...

5972
04:53:42,000 --> 04:53:43,840
I feel bad.

5973
04:53:44,040 --> 04:53:45,560
I feel like these weapons have...

5974
04:53:48,220 --> 04:53:52,040
They've stopped my ability of trying to do combos.

5975
04:53:52,540 --> 04:53:58,200
As soon as I start playing Nero again, this playstyle makes my brain so smooth.

5976
04:54:04,800 --> 04:54:06,260
Was it just a shortcut?

5977
04:54:08,160 --> 04:54:09,240
Aw, man.

5978
04:54:13,260 --> 04:54:16,760
Oh, see, I thought that this room...

5979
04:54:17,920 --> 04:54:18,540
Oh, okay.

5980
04:54:19,300 --> 04:54:20,920
That's why I didn't walk over to it.

5981
04:54:21,080 --> 04:54:26,100
I thought that this room was... Hold on, I'm pretty sure it's at the beginning.

5982
04:54:28,400 --> 04:54:32,900
I thought it was one of the rooms that we started out with, so I was like, oh, it just made a circle.

5983
04:54:33,920 --> 04:54:34,780
But it doesn't.

5984
04:54:36,820 --> 04:54:37,180
Nice.

5985
04:54:41,000 --> 04:54:41,520
Can't see.

5986
04:54:44,700 --> 04:54:45,060
Oh.

5987
04:54:57,460 --> 04:55:00,020
I wish... I wish we didn't go back.

5988
04:55:03,120 --> 04:55:05,180
Dante, I'm... I've paid my dues.

5989
04:55:05,600 --> 04:55:07,900
Oh, I see the secret level here.

5990
04:55:08,040 --> 04:55:08,680
You see that?

5991
04:55:10,280 --> 04:55:11,500
I see that.

5992
04:55:13,180 --> 04:55:14,920
I see that secret mission.

5993
04:55:18,580 --> 04:55:20,300
Why is the music so cute?

5994
04:55:23,560 --> 04:55:26,100
Why is it so fancy and cute all of a sudden?

5995
04:55:26,980 --> 04:55:28,300
Is it because we're being nostalgic?

5996
04:55:30,800 --> 04:55:31,300
It's okay.

5997
04:55:31,380 --> 04:55:32,100
I don't need the secret.

5998
04:55:32,260 --> 04:55:33,220
I don't need the secret mission.

5999
04:55:35,980 --> 04:55:37,960
And I don't want to do the secret mission, you guys.

6000
04:55:38,400 --> 04:55:38,960
It's fine.

6001
04:55:41,100 --> 04:55:41,820
It's fine.

6002
04:55:46,040 --> 04:55:48,240
99% of them I can't complete anyway.

6003
04:55:50,540 --> 04:55:53,240
99% of them I'm... I'm stuck at.

6004
04:55:53,820 --> 04:55:55,020
So it's fine.

6005
04:55:58,680 --> 04:55:59,800
There we go.

6006
04:56:01,960 --> 04:56:02,320
Oh!

6007
04:56:02,820 --> 04:56:02,980
Oh!

6008
04:56:03,120 --> 04:56:04,120
Now we can get it.

6009
04:56:06,160 --> 04:56:07,860
Now we can...

6010
04:56:07,860 --> 04:56:09,240
We can get the...

6011
04:56:09,240 --> 04:56:09,900
Swordmaster.

6012
04:56:14,820 --> 04:56:16,340
Swordmaster 4!

6013
04:56:23,170 --> 04:56:25,370
Wheelie Jump 2.

6014
04:56:25,810 --> 04:56:27,550
Dance Macabre.

6015
04:56:29,410 --> 04:56:30,750
Real Impact.

6016
04:56:31,170 --> 04:56:32,350
Pyro Mania.

6017
04:56:33,350 --> 04:56:34,710
Real Impact.

6018
04:56:36,050 --> 04:56:39,410
99% of Minkies quit before they hit it big.

6019
04:56:43,210 --> 04:56:45,910
Now, what was the one I wanted to buy?

6020
04:56:45,910 --> 04:56:47,350
Oh, it was this one.

6021
04:56:49,250 --> 04:56:50,330
Okay, I'll learn it.

6022
04:56:52,150 --> 04:56:53,670
Instead, I learned...

6023
04:56:56,130 --> 04:56:56,570
Slipstream.

6024
04:57:01,110 --> 04:57:01,550
Okay.

6025
04:57:01,790 --> 04:57:02,390
I'm good for now.

6026
04:57:15,610 --> 04:57:16,050
Whoa.

6027
04:57:20,340 --> 04:57:22,760
I can't believe any of this is still standing.

6028
04:57:24,180 --> 04:57:26,360
The music is so emo-y.

6029
04:57:29,140 --> 04:57:30,500
This little home.

6030
04:57:33,180 --> 04:57:35,000
You're home, doctor.

6031
04:57:36,500 --> 04:57:37,320
Hold on.

6032
04:57:37,840 --> 04:57:39,300
We'll do a dramatic walk-in.

6033
04:57:42,560 --> 04:57:43,200
Cinema.

6034
04:57:49,000 --> 04:57:51,760
Why is Mama the only one that looks good?

6035
04:57:51,760 --> 04:57:52,660
Here you are.

6036
04:57:53,060 --> 04:57:53,200
Oh.

6037
04:57:54,260 --> 04:57:55,340
Hello, Griffin.

6038
04:57:56,280 --> 04:57:57,280
Hey, what's wrong with you?

6039
04:57:59,240 --> 04:57:59,620
Hey!

6040
04:58:00,200 --> 04:58:00,540
Hey!

6041
04:58:01,220 --> 04:58:02,240
Hey, Dante!

6042
04:58:03,400 --> 04:58:06,020
The demonic power was activated in me once.

6043
04:58:07,060 --> 04:58:10,540
When Virgil lovingly jammed this through my chest.

6044
04:58:10,540 --> 04:58:11,220
Hehe.

6045
04:58:11,880 --> 04:58:12,100
Hehe.

6046
04:58:12,920 --> 04:58:14,640
I always wondered...

6047
04:58:16,320 --> 04:58:18,560
Why did my father give me the rebellion?

6048
04:58:19,620 --> 04:58:20,220
Okay.

6049
04:58:20,620 --> 04:58:21,680
What are you muttering?

6050
04:58:24,040 --> 04:58:27,340
Over the years, I've been stabbed and jabbed by a number of things.

6051
04:58:28,520 --> 04:58:30,020
But who would have ever guessed?

6052
04:58:32,000 --> 04:58:33,800
Have you lost your mind?

6053
04:58:34,040 --> 04:58:35,480
There's a demon to destroy.

6054
04:58:35,780 --> 04:58:36,900
Kill yourself later.

6055
04:58:39,480 --> 04:58:45,240
If the Amano can separate man from devil, then what about the rebellion?

6056
04:58:45,520 --> 04:58:45,860
No!

6057
04:58:46,760 --> 04:58:47,380
No!

6058
04:58:54,140 --> 04:58:55,720
Absorbing the Sparta!

6059
04:58:57,920 --> 04:58:58,640
Oh!

6060
04:58:58,940 --> 04:59:00,440
He's hulking out!

6061
04:59:00,720 --> 04:59:01,440
Oh my god!

6062
04:59:07,060 --> 04:59:09,920
And that's when he goes to save Nero!

6063
04:59:09,920 --> 04:59:09,940
Oh!

6064
04:59:14,220 --> 04:59:15,560
Dad, damn!

6065
04:59:16,220 --> 04:59:17,780
Holy bakery!

6066
04:59:26,920 --> 04:59:28,560
It can't be.

6067
04:59:31,240 --> 04:59:31,920
Dante.

6068
04:59:32,700 --> 04:59:34,020
Son of a bitch.

6069
04:59:34,120 --> 04:59:34,520
Dante.

6070
04:59:35,400 --> 04:59:37,420
I know you couldn't be killed that easily.

6071
04:59:37,660 --> 04:59:37,920
Yeah!

6072
04:59:39,140 --> 04:59:39,820
Hey.

6073
04:59:40,360 --> 04:59:41,460
He's all yours.

6074
04:59:42,640 --> 04:59:45,300
But don't let it... become a habit.

6075
04:59:46,760 --> 04:59:48,060
I love Miro.

6076
04:59:51,900 --> 04:59:53,000
Win, Dante!

6077
04:59:53,300 --> 04:59:53,700
Win!

6078
04:59:53,900 --> 04:59:54,620
Win, Dante!

6079
04:59:54,840 --> 04:59:55,000
Win!

6080
04:59:59,020 --> 05:00:01,100
But now he became literal deadweight.

6081
05:00:21,060 --> 05:00:22,620
Devil's sword, Dante.

6082
05:00:25,260 --> 05:00:27,860
He evolved... Pokemon style.

6083
05:00:29,600 --> 05:00:30,580
Devil's sword, Dante!

6084
05:00:30,880 --> 05:00:31,520
A blade born.

6085
05:00:31,740 --> 05:00:37,820
When Dante absorbed the rebellion into his body, the weapon shares both his name and his will.

6086
05:00:38,820 --> 05:00:40,560
Does Dante have an ass to surpass?

6087
05:00:40,800 --> 05:00:43,140
That was... that was really...

6088
05:00:43,140 --> 05:00:44,200
You guys... oh my gosh.

6089
05:00:44,240 --> 05:00:46,480
There was like that one meme of the guy...

6090
05:00:46,480 --> 05:00:48,040
like squatting down.

6091
05:00:49,320 --> 05:00:50,860
Like looking from behind.

6092
05:00:51,180 --> 05:00:52,240
Or he was like looking over...

6093
05:00:52,920 --> 05:00:54,540
He was like a big superhero guy.

6094
05:00:54,540 --> 05:00:55,880
That's what it reminds me of.

6095
05:00:57,200 --> 05:00:59,060
The best DT in the series.

6096
05:01:00,640 --> 05:01:01,440
Omni-man?

6097
05:01:01,440 --> 05:01:01,960
Maybe.

6098
05:01:03,800 --> 05:01:07,780
The basic abilities of rebellion and Devil Sword Sparta carry over to this blade.

6099
05:01:07,900 --> 05:01:11,540
Impressing B in Sword Master style conjures swords that attack autonomously.

6100
05:01:12,340 --> 05:01:17,460
Use the blades in tandem for a relentless wave of hack and slash carnage.

6101
05:01:18,240 --> 05:01:19,440
Oh, I will.

6102
05:01:20,840 --> 05:01:22,220
Activating Devil Trigger!

6103
05:01:22,600 --> 05:01:25,720
Wait, I can still activate Devil Trigger in this form!

6104
05:01:28,260 --> 05:01:32,920
With this equipped, we'll conjure swords that provide different types of support depending on your style.

6105
05:01:33,240 --> 05:01:38,280
These include higher mobility, simultaneous attacks, automatic counters, or strong defense!

6106
05:01:40,700 --> 05:01:41,600
Oh, oh god.

6107
05:01:42,000 --> 05:01:42,460
Okay.

6108
05:01:50,140 --> 05:01:50,600
Wait.

6109
05:01:50,840 --> 05:01:51,780
Am I doing this right?

6110
05:01:52,700 --> 05:01:53,980
Oh, oh, Dante.

6111
05:01:54,340 --> 05:01:54,480
Wait.

6112
05:01:55,040 --> 05:01:55,640
Oh, wait.

6113
05:01:55,760 --> 05:01:56,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6114
05:01:56,760 --> 05:02:00,340
Hold LB to change from the DT to the SDT gauge.

6115
05:02:00,780 --> 05:02:02,960
There is a new gauge above the DT gauge.

6116
05:02:03,840 --> 05:02:06,240
I was pressing B like it told me to.

6117
05:02:09,560 --> 05:02:11,380
Do I have to lock on and press B?

6118
05:02:15,160 --> 05:02:16,000
B is teleport.

6119
05:02:16,680 --> 05:02:17,080
Oh.

6120
05:02:17,940 --> 05:02:19,320
Wait, but it just told me.

6121
05:02:21,800 --> 05:02:23,600
It just told me to.

6122
05:02:24,880 --> 05:02:26,780
As far as normal form.

6123
05:02:27,320 --> 05:02:28,140
My god.

6124
05:02:32,790 --> 05:02:34,470
That's being in regular...

6125
05:02:34,470 --> 05:02:35,050
Okay, I got it.

6126
05:02:37,350 --> 05:02:40,810
Hold LB to change from the DT gauge to the SDT gauge.

6127
05:02:40,850 --> 05:02:42,730
There is a new gauge above the DT gauge.

6128
05:02:42,890 --> 05:02:44,210
The sin double trigger.

6129
05:02:44,950 --> 05:02:48,830
To fill this gauge, transfer power from the DT gauge by holding down LB.

6130
05:02:51,310 --> 05:02:53,590
Charge SDT gauge to max.

6131
05:02:53,870 --> 05:02:54,790
Then hold LB.

6132
05:03:00,960 --> 05:03:01,520
Okay.

6133
05:03:02,960 --> 05:03:04,740
I think I get it.

6134
05:03:05,680 --> 05:03:07,500
So I hold LB.

6135
05:03:08,200 --> 05:03:09,500
And then I...

6136
05:03:12,320 --> 05:03:13,960
Hold it to transform.

6137
05:03:16,020 --> 05:03:17,540
Just hold until...

6138
05:03:17,540 --> 05:03:18,240
Full and glowy.

6139
05:03:18,520 --> 05:03:19,300
Sounds good to me.

6140
05:03:28,490 --> 05:03:29,010
Oh.

6141
05:03:35,660 --> 05:03:37,080
I'm figuring this out.

6142
05:03:37,240 --> 05:03:38,200
Wait, so now if I...

6143
05:03:38,200 --> 05:03:39,200
Oh, I see them.

6144
05:03:39,340 --> 05:03:39,960
That's so cool.

6145
05:03:39,960 --> 05:03:40,020
Cool.

6146
05:03:41,260 --> 05:03:41,680
Okay.

6147
05:03:48,190 --> 05:03:48,610
Uh...

6148
05:03:48,610 --> 05:03:48,890
Alright.

6149
05:04:16,870 --> 05:04:18,110
Oh my god, they bounce now.

6150
05:04:18,790 --> 05:04:19,050
Let me

6151
05:04:22,140 --> 05:04:23,160
just...

6152
05:04:23,940 --> 05:04:24,940
Okay, that didn't work.

6153
05:04:32,720 --> 05:04:33,360
And then last.

6154
05:04:33,780 --> 05:04:34,700
And it's close.

6155
05:04:36,560 --> 05:04:38,280
Okay, now how do I...

6156
05:04:38,770 --> 05:04:39,680
Get into this mode.

6157
05:04:39,880 --> 05:04:40,520
Oh, there we go.

6158
05:04:40,760 --> 05:04:41,540
Oh, okay, okay.

6159
05:04:41,840 --> 05:04:42,200
Okay.

6160
05:04:42,360 --> 05:04:43,180
I'm figuring it out.

6161
05:04:45,040 --> 05:04:45,720
Oh.

6162
05:05:05,160 --> 05:05:05,840
Oh.

6163
05:05:06,000 --> 05:05:06,300
Oh.

6164
05:05:06,340 --> 05:05:06,480
Oh, Dante.

6165
05:05:06,780 --> 05:05:06,900
Please.

6166
05:05:10,240 --> 05:05:11,400
It's so strong though.

6167
05:05:13,660 --> 05:05:14,720
Let's transfer.

6168
05:05:17,440 --> 05:05:18,120
Okay.

6169
05:05:20,360 --> 05:05:21,040
Ouch.

6170
05:05:21,720 --> 05:05:22,440
I thought you stomp.

6171
05:05:28,550 --> 05:05:29,510
Oh my god.

6172
05:05:29,770 --> 05:05:30,690
This stinking...

6173
05:05:37,530 --> 05:05:38,770
I'm gonna become the Joker.

6174
05:05:42,340 --> 05:05:43,900
I hate the tentacles.

6175
05:05:54,820 --> 05:05:56,100
Yeah, let's try that again.

6176
05:05:56,260 --> 05:05:57,500
Now that I get it.

6177
05:05:57,720 --> 05:05:58,640
So let's try that again.

6178
05:06:00,440 --> 05:06:01,440
Let's try it again.

6179
05:06:01,800 --> 05:06:02,520
And the...

6180
05:06:02,520 --> 05:06:03,360
Now that I...

6181
05:06:03,360 --> 05:06:04,600
I was like so...

6182
05:06:04,600 --> 05:06:06,800
My brain was like still trying to...

6183
05:06:07,420 --> 05:06:07,640
To...

6184
05:06:07,640 --> 05:06:09,720
To absorb the information.

6185
05:06:11,580 --> 05:06:12,020
Redoo.

6186
05:06:12,740 --> 05:06:12,940
Okay.

6187
05:06:13,220 --> 05:06:13,960
We got this.

6188
05:06:15,540 --> 05:06:17,160
Yeah, more time to play with it.

6189
05:06:17,340 --> 05:06:17,480
True.

6190
05:06:18,180 --> 05:06:19,140
Oh wait, where am I?

6191
05:06:19,260 --> 05:06:19,420
Oh.

6192
05:06:20,020 --> 05:06:20,940
Wait, where am I?

6193
05:06:22,100 --> 05:06:23,240
Where am I?

6194
05:06:25,320 --> 05:06:26,460
Oh, we're at our house.

6195
05:06:26,600 --> 05:06:26,700
Okay.

6196
05:06:29,540 --> 05:06:30,420
Holy shit.

6197
05:06:30,880 --> 05:06:31,060
Okay.

6198
05:06:31,380 --> 05:06:33,360
I can't believe any of this is still standing.

6199
05:06:34,160 --> 05:06:36,620
So can I use all my like old moves too?

6200
05:06:36,780 --> 05:06:38,440
Like stinger and things like that or...

6201
05:06:42,380 --> 05:06:43,220
Oh, I can.

6202
05:06:43,720 --> 05:06:43,960
Okay.

6203
05:06:44,460 --> 05:06:45,180
Oh no, yes.

6204
05:06:46,020 --> 05:06:47,500
New moves you have to buy?

6205
05:06:48,080 --> 05:06:48,860
Not yet.

6206
05:06:49,940 --> 05:06:50,880
Okay, okay, okay.

6207
05:06:51,120 --> 05:06:53,160
Well, I'll just not get so far away from it.

6208
05:06:53,220 --> 05:06:55,580
Because I think the tentacles are what the...

6209
05:06:55,580 --> 05:06:56,820
Is pretty...

6210
05:06:56,820 --> 05:06:57,760
Wait, okay, hold on.

6211
05:07:02,200 --> 05:07:02,800
Okay.

6212
05:07:09,200 --> 05:07:09,800
Okay.

6213
05:07:09,800 --> 05:07:10,460
Holy cow.

6214
05:07:12,000 --> 05:07:13,340
Okay, we broke it now.

6215
05:07:19,480 --> 05:07:20,080
Okay.

6216
05:07:20,580 --> 05:07:20,920
Okay.

6217
05:07:21,220 --> 05:07:21,480
All right.

6218
05:07:22,400 --> 05:07:23,340
Oh my god.

6219
05:07:23,400 --> 05:07:24,220
That's so evil.

6220
05:07:24,220 --> 05:07:25,040
Please, game.

6221
05:07:25,560 --> 05:07:26,780
Nowhere to go.

6222
05:07:28,160 --> 05:07:30,160
I'm not even that far away from you.

6223
05:07:31,400 --> 05:07:32,300
Don't spam it.

6224
05:07:32,500 --> 05:07:33,180
Don't spam it.

6225
05:07:33,260 --> 05:07:33,600
That's rude.

6226
05:07:35,680 --> 05:07:36,400
Don't spam it.

6227
05:07:36,440 --> 05:07:36,800
That's rude.

6228
05:07:37,320 --> 05:07:37,720
Don't do it.

6229
05:07:37,780 --> 05:07:38,100
Don't do it.

6230
05:07:38,180 --> 05:07:38,500
That's rude.

6231
05:07:40,120 --> 05:07:40,840
Don't do it.

6232
05:07:44,280 --> 05:07:44,780
Don't do it.

6233
05:07:44,860 --> 05:07:45,140
It's rude.

6234
05:07:45,140 --> 05:07:46,320
Don't do it, it's rude!

6235
05:08:08,110 --> 05:08:09,390
It's okay, we're back, baby.

6236
05:08:09,890 --> 05:08:10,910
We're back, baby!

6237
05:08:16,580 --> 05:08:18,700
He's so small compared to this dude.

6238
05:08:26,040 --> 05:08:26,580
Nooooo!

6239
05:08:27,880 --> 05:08:29,420
Evil, evil, evil.

6240
05:08:35,500 --> 05:08:37,580
Wait, it's actually not back.

6241
05:08:37,580 --> 05:08:39,380
As long as you live.

6242
05:08:39,740 --> 05:08:40,060
Oh my god.

6243
05:08:43,380 --> 05:08:45,140
I was trying to get health.

6244
05:08:54,340 --> 05:08:55,560
Come on, come on!

6245
05:08:55,740 --> 05:08:56,780
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold!

6246
05:08:57,300 --> 05:08:58,640
I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding!

6247
05:09:01,640 --> 05:09:02,580
Why isn't it working?

6248
05:09:03,840 --> 05:09:04,260
Why?

6249
05:09:04,500 --> 05:09:05,460
Why won't you transform?

6250
05:09:06,220 --> 05:09:06,840
There we go.

6251
05:09:08,020 --> 05:09:09,720
Oh, I have to release it.

6252
05:09:09,800 --> 05:09:10,360
That's right, you're right.

6253
05:09:10,880 --> 05:09:11,400
I'll keep forgetting.

6254
05:09:16,580 --> 05:09:18,020
Come on, just a little bit more!

6255
05:09:18,560 --> 05:09:18,960
Yeah!

6256
05:09:25,740 --> 05:09:28,360
All this time, and you still don't get it.

6257
05:09:33,860 --> 05:09:34,300
What?

6258
05:09:35,440 --> 05:09:39,340
It is you who does not understand.

6259
05:09:42,040 --> 05:09:43,160
What's happening?

6260
05:09:43,580 --> 05:09:44,040
What?

6261
05:09:44,400 --> 05:09:46,760
It has begun.

6262
05:09:47,800 --> 05:09:48,400
What?

6263
05:09:52,610 --> 05:09:53,440
What do you mean?

6264
05:09:54,040 --> 05:09:56,460
What, why was it so dependent on the time?

6265
05:09:58,500 --> 05:09:59,600
It's tea time.

6266
05:09:59,760 --> 05:10:00,200
It's tea time.

6267
05:10:00,200 --> 05:10:00,620
Twelve o'clock.

6268
05:10:01,040 --> 05:10:02,500
It's, it's time for lunch.

6269
05:10:03,660 --> 05:10:04,100
Uh oh.

6270
05:10:04,180 --> 05:10:04,800
What's happening?

6271
05:10:05,100 --> 05:10:06,740
Yeah, that's what I'm asking too.

6272
05:10:06,840 --> 05:10:07,380
Bad news!

6273
05:10:07,640 --> 05:10:08,340
Gotta go now!

6274
05:10:08,420 --> 05:10:09,720
That house plant is pissed off!

6275
05:10:13,220 --> 05:10:13,960
Oh my god.

6276
05:10:14,640 --> 05:10:16,900
Oh, Trish, you might need to like, princess carry this guy.

6277
05:10:22,610 --> 05:10:23,310
Come on!

6278
05:10:23,490 --> 05:10:24,350
Come on, Trish!

6279
05:10:24,710 --> 05:10:26,010
Nice win game, I think.

6280
05:10:28,630 --> 05:10:31,070
I don't feel like I gamed that one, but that's okay.

6281
05:10:33,730 --> 05:10:35,330
It was just a bunch of power.

6282
05:10:35,530 --> 05:10:36,610
It was just really strong.

6283
05:10:37,990 --> 05:10:41,270
The cloud fog is revealed in its entirety.

6284
05:10:49,480 --> 05:10:50,520
This inconvenience.

6285
05:10:52,860 --> 05:10:54,200
Oh, he's going in.

6286
05:10:54,920 --> 05:10:55,720
Oh, it looks so yummy.

6287
05:10:56,860 --> 05:10:57,380
Oh!

6288
05:11:10,620 --> 05:11:13,200
Oh, I think I got C's across the board, baby.

6289
05:11:13,540 --> 05:11:14,640
How did I get a B?

6290
05:11:17,160 --> 05:11:20,800
I literally got all C's, and then I was just like...

6291
05:11:20,800 --> 05:11:21,180
Eh, B.

6292
05:11:27,740 --> 05:11:31,240
Now that the cat is out of the bag, if you look up videos of Urizen's voice...

6293
05:11:31,240 --> 05:11:33,140
Pitched up, it'll be Virgil's voice.

6294
05:11:33,720 --> 05:11:34,180
What?

6295
05:11:35,420 --> 05:11:36,300
Oh my god.

6296
05:11:36,860 --> 05:11:37,720
That's crazy.

6297
05:11:39,800 --> 05:11:41,520
A 1.2 multiplier.

6298
05:11:41,900 --> 05:11:42,320
Yippee!

6299
05:11:44,360 --> 05:11:44,820
Yay.

6300
05:11:54,710 --> 05:11:55,230
Yippee!

6301
05:12:04,760 --> 05:12:08,800
Also, I just realized I had the audio up for that whole time.

6302
05:12:09,000 --> 05:12:10,200
I'm sorry if it was really loud.

6303
05:12:18,370 --> 05:12:19,250
Am I ready?

6304
05:12:23,330 --> 05:12:24,850
Yeah, what is Urizen after?

6305
05:12:24,850 --> 05:12:25,590
He's at the top.

6306
05:12:25,970 --> 05:12:27,310
Of the Klyphod.

6307
05:12:27,630 --> 05:12:29,730
It's the other way around, Dante.

6308
05:12:30,610 --> 05:12:33,870
This is the lowest level of the Klyphod's upper echelon.

6309
05:12:34,190 --> 05:12:34,750
Echelon.

6310
05:12:34,810 --> 05:12:36,950
Human blood is the source of demon's power.

6311
05:12:37,270 --> 05:12:42,350
The fruit born through the Klyphod is even more dense than the blood that created it.

6312
05:12:43,010 --> 05:12:44,790
Its power is unparalleled.

6313
05:12:45,510 --> 05:12:48,850
Even the almighty Mundus used it to become king of the outer world.

6314
05:12:51,090 --> 05:12:51,530
Oh.

6315
05:12:51,890 --> 05:12:52,330
He's a little smirk.

6316
05:12:52,330 --> 05:12:54,910
Yeah, well, that's a lovely story and all, but...

6317
05:12:54,910 --> 05:12:55,870
As long as we know where to find him.

6318
05:12:58,150 --> 05:12:59,270
Whoa, you!

6319
05:13:00,410 --> 05:13:01,550
I'm the infamous Dante.

6320
05:13:04,650 --> 05:13:05,850
I'm Nicoletta Goldstein.

6321
05:13:07,470 --> 05:13:08,010
Tell familiar?

6322
05:13:09,650 --> 05:13:11,910
My grandmother is... is Nell Goldstein.

6323
05:13:12,110 --> 05:13:16,110
The gunsmith that made all your fancy weapons that you got...

6324
05:13:16,110 --> 05:13:17,750
Back there.

6325
05:13:20,730 --> 05:13:22,010
Yeah, there she is!

6326
05:13:22,990 --> 05:13:23,430
Oh!

6327
05:13:26,590 --> 05:13:27,950
You don't much look like her.

6328
05:13:28,630 --> 05:13:31,090
Yeah, I got my looks from my daddy.

6329
05:13:31,970 --> 05:13:33,110
That's about all I got from him.

6330
05:13:34,000 --> 05:13:36,810
But based on his research, I managed to cobble this.

6331
05:13:38,130 --> 05:13:39,390
What the hell?

6332
05:13:40,310 --> 05:13:41,430
Consider it a gift.

6333
05:13:41,790 --> 05:13:43,730
In honor of us finally meeting.

6334
05:13:44,090 --> 05:13:44,610
Yee-haw!

6335
05:13:45,410 --> 05:13:45,790
Meeting.

6336
05:13:46,370 --> 05:13:46,890
Meeting?

6337
05:13:50,330 --> 05:13:50,990
Oh!

6338
05:13:51,190 --> 05:13:51,350
Oh!

6339
05:13:51,750 --> 05:13:51,810
Oh!

6340
05:13:52,050 --> 05:13:52,410
Oh!

6341
05:13:52,410 --> 05:13:52,790
Oh my god!

6342
05:13:56,020 --> 05:13:56,620
No!

6343
05:13:57,020 --> 05:13:57,680
No, no!

6344
05:13:57,760 --> 05:13:58,680
It's happening again!

6345
05:14:21,770 --> 05:14:22,790
I'll take that.

6346
05:14:23,990 --> 05:14:24,650
Dante.

6347
05:14:26,010 --> 05:14:26,950
I'm gonna go too.

6348
05:14:28,210 --> 05:14:29,610
Why don't you sit this one out?

6349
05:14:30,150 --> 05:14:30,250
Oh.

6350
05:14:31,030 --> 05:14:32,230
That you call me dead weight again?

6351
05:14:32,410 --> 05:14:33,150
No, thanks.

6352
05:14:33,370 --> 05:14:34,290
He really hates that.

6353
05:14:34,490 --> 05:14:35,650
I don't have the power I need.

6354
05:14:35,890 --> 05:14:36,670
Right here!

6355
05:14:37,610 --> 05:14:38,690
You don't understand.

6356
05:14:39,050 --> 05:14:40,070
It's not what I mean.

6357
05:14:41,470 --> 05:14:42,570
Let him go, Dante.

6358
05:14:44,630 --> 05:14:47,470
Time is a luxury that we can no longer afford.

6359
05:14:48,530 --> 05:14:50,830
We must chase after him, post-haste.

6360
05:14:52,310 --> 05:14:52,750
What?

6361
05:14:52,970 --> 05:14:53,890
Does that mean you're going too?

6362
05:14:54,350 --> 05:14:56,210
I have a duty to see this through.

6363
05:14:56,470 --> 05:14:56,830
Oh god.

6364
05:14:57,090 --> 05:14:58,490
You are looking really rough.

6365
05:14:59,170 --> 05:15:00,770
Well, that's all you had to say, Mr. Poetry.

6366
05:15:00,830 --> 05:15:01,810
He is looking real.

6367
05:15:01,810 --> 05:15:02,590
I'm gonna go my way.

6368
05:15:02,890 --> 05:15:03,730
And you guys can go yours.

6369
05:15:03,930 --> 05:15:05,310
Oh god, he's actually flaking away.

6370
05:15:05,310 --> 05:15:06,370
Let's just say that's the best for the cause.

6371
05:15:08,990 --> 05:15:10,330
My chat broke.

6372
05:15:10,970 --> 05:15:11,830
Hold on.

6373
05:15:12,510 --> 05:15:14,010
I'll refresh it after this.

6374
05:15:19,500 --> 05:15:20,880
Poor sick boy.

6375
05:15:23,800 --> 05:15:25,000
Dr. Faust!

6376
05:15:25,520 --> 05:15:28,860
A red hat that consumes robs to launch special attacks.

6377
05:15:29,000 --> 05:15:32,020
Earn tons of robs from foes if you don't run out of your own fur.

6378
05:15:32,020 --> 05:15:33,140
Oh.

6379
05:15:35,900 --> 05:15:36,540
Gamble...

6380
05:15:36,540 --> 05:15:37,680
Alchemical...

6381
05:15:37,680 --> 05:15:38,640
Alchemical...

6382
05:15:38,640 --> 05:15:40,720
Alchemical gambler's garb!

6383
05:15:43,080 --> 05:15:46,940
Dr. Faust consumes robs to attack foes.

6384
05:15:47,100 --> 05:15:49,880
Most attacks require a sufficient amount of robs to use.

6385
05:15:50,160 --> 05:15:53,900
The robs consumed are displayed on the upper right side of the screen.

6386
05:15:53,900 --> 05:15:56,360
Keep an eye on your balance and don't spend them all.

6387
05:15:57,480 --> 05:15:59,800
Using Dr. Faust's skill set...

6388
05:15:59,800 --> 05:16:01,780
Skill set hat!

6389
05:16:03,140 --> 05:16:05,700
Lets you earn a ton more robs.

6390
05:16:06,120 --> 05:16:08,260
Strike foes with the hat, then go on the offensive.

6391
05:16:11,800 --> 05:16:13,260
Gotcha, gotcha hat!

6392
05:16:13,520 --> 05:16:14,420
Oh my gosh.

6393
05:16:14,600 --> 05:16:15,440
Wait, I don't...

6394
05:16:15,440 --> 05:16:17,320
I don't know who I want to play as yet.

6395
05:16:17,740 --> 05:16:18,360
Hold on.

6396
05:16:18,540 --> 05:16:21,260
Let me reset my chat real quick.

6397
05:16:25,320 --> 05:16:26,760
One moment, please!

6398
05:16:28,900 --> 05:16:30,060
The robs.

6399
05:16:30,540 --> 05:16:31,540
The robs!

6400
05:16:32,960 --> 05:16:33,880
Roar pot.

6401
05:16:35,820 --> 05:16:37,140
Dante's the right answer.

6402
05:16:37,480 --> 05:16:38,260
Not gonna lie.

6403
05:16:38,660 --> 05:16:40,300
I'm having a lot of fun with Dante.

6404
05:16:41,860 --> 05:16:43,160
Give him the hat!

6405
05:16:43,460 --> 05:16:44,680
Give him the hat!

6406
05:16:45,900 --> 05:16:51,040
So the hat is made from the flying Faust demons from DMC4 and it's busted as all heck.

6407
05:16:51,260 --> 05:16:51,740
Seriously?

6408
05:16:53,460 --> 05:16:53,980
Ugh!

6409
05:16:56,740 --> 05:16:57,780
Well guys...

6410
05:16:57,780 --> 05:16:59,640
We're on mission 13.

6411
05:16:59,660 --> 05:17:01,220
That means we have...

6412
05:17:01,740 --> 05:17:02,640
8 more...

6413
05:17:02,640 --> 05:17:04,100
I only got through...

6414
05:17:04,100 --> 05:17:04,740
Wait...

6415
05:17:04,740 --> 05:17:05,680
No, I got through a handful.

6416
05:17:06,140 --> 05:17:07,800
I started at mission 8.

6417
05:17:08,240 --> 05:17:10,120
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

6418
05:17:10,280 --> 05:17:11,440
We got through 5 missions today.

6419
05:17:14,300 --> 05:17:14,820
So...

6420
05:17:16,800 --> 05:17:17,820
So 8 more.

6421
05:17:18,880 --> 05:17:22,100
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

6422
05:17:22,420 --> 05:17:22,540
Yeah.

6423
05:17:23,040 --> 05:17:23,480
7 left.

6424
05:17:23,540 --> 05:17:24,360
No, I thought it was...

6425
05:17:24,360 --> 05:17:25,760
I thought it was...

6426
05:17:25,760 --> 05:17:26,120
20.

6427
05:17:30,280 --> 05:17:30,720
So...

6428
05:17:30,720 --> 05:17:32,180
We have to do mission 13.

6429
05:17:34,000 --> 05:17:34,440
Which...

6430
05:17:34,440 --> 05:17:35,620
The final two are short.

6431
05:17:35,780 --> 05:17:36,140
Oh really?

6432
05:17:36,320 --> 05:17:36,640
Okay.

6433
05:17:38,900 --> 05:17:39,380
Yeah.

6434
05:17:39,480 --> 05:17:40,740
Yeah, you will include 13.

6435
05:17:40,740 --> 05:17:41,920
So it's uh...

6436
05:17:41,920 --> 05:17:42,600
So it's 8 more.

6437
05:17:43,000 --> 05:17:43,480
Right?

6438
05:17:43,840 --> 05:17:45,900
Yeah, 7 after this mission.

6439
05:17:50,110 --> 05:17:53,110
Do you think it'll take about the same amount of time that it took me today?

6440
05:17:53,110 --> 05:17:53,490
Anyway...

6441
05:17:53,490 --> 05:17:54,610
I also...

6442
05:17:54,610 --> 05:17:55,990
Kind of dilly-dallied a lot.

6443
05:17:56,230 --> 05:17:56,770
Running around.

6444
05:17:57,190 --> 05:17:58,670
Doing silly mumbo-jumbo.

6445
05:18:01,670 --> 05:18:02,190
Um...

6446
05:18:08,660 --> 05:18:09,760
Some are short.

6447
05:18:10,280 --> 05:18:12,240
Depends if you learn or not.

6448
05:18:12,480 --> 05:18:12,880
Hahaha.

6449
05:18:15,900 --> 05:18:17,340
Cause I want to finish tomorrow.

6450
05:18:17,580 --> 05:18:19,340
Maybe I'll just start at the same time tomorrow then.

6451
05:18:25,770 --> 05:18:28,190
Maybe I'll start at the same time tomorrow then.

6452
05:18:28,850 --> 05:18:30,410
Cause I want to beat it tomorrow.

6453
05:18:37,280 --> 05:18:37,700
Yeah.

6454
05:18:40,180 --> 05:18:40,600
Mm.

6455
05:18:40,860 --> 05:18:41,160
Okay.

6456
05:18:42,360 --> 05:18:43,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6457
05:18:43,240 --> 05:18:43,820
We'll do that then.

6458
05:18:44,260 --> 05:18:44,680
Um...

6459
05:18:44,680 --> 05:18:45,320
I think that's okay.

6460
05:18:46,200 --> 05:18:46,580
Cool.

6461
05:18:46,980 --> 05:18:47,160
Then!

6462
05:18:50,700 --> 05:18:51,120
Um...

6463
05:18:51,120 --> 05:18:52,280
Yes, yes, yes.

6464
05:18:52,680 --> 05:18:52,880
What?

6465
05:18:53,240 --> 05:18:54,140
Did I miss?

6466
05:18:56,740 --> 05:18:57,160
Oh.

6467
05:18:57,580 --> 05:18:58,000
Villain!

6468
05:18:58,060 --> 05:18:59,200
Thank you so much for the Haka Zuba!

6469
05:18:59,440 --> 05:19:00,520
Wait, I think I missed it earlier.

6470
05:19:01,300 --> 05:19:02,180
A little backstory.

6471
05:19:02,400 --> 05:19:04,220
An interview with DMC Devil May Cry people.

6472
05:19:04,220 --> 05:19:07,780
They talked about how their Dante was super cool and banged chicks.

6473
05:19:08,100 --> 05:19:09,620
How he's not a gay cowboy.

6474
05:19:09,980 --> 05:19:11,800
Or Michael Jackson rip-off.

6475
05:19:12,100 --> 05:19:12,440
Cowboy.

6476
05:19:12,660 --> 05:19:12,960
Hahaha.

6477
05:19:16,180 --> 05:19:17,880
DMC loves to reference everything.

6478
05:19:18,200 --> 05:19:18,420
Hahaha.

6479
05:19:18,700 --> 05:19:18,940
Wow.

6480
05:19:19,500 --> 05:19:20,480
I love that.

6481
05:19:21,440 --> 05:19:21,740
Yuni!

6482
05:19:21,860 --> 05:19:22,880
Thank you so much for the five gift.

6483
05:19:22,960 --> 05:19:23,520
Thank you.

6484
05:19:24,220 --> 05:19:24,580
Hahaha.

6485
05:19:26,500 --> 05:19:27,340
That's so funny.

6486
05:19:28,520 --> 05:19:29,340
Yeah, I need...

6487
05:19:29,340 --> 05:19:29,840
I need to...

6488
05:19:29,840 --> 05:19:30,560
I need to go eat.

6489
05:19:30,560 --> 05:19:31,460
I'm so hungry.

6490
05:19:31,620 --> 05:19:32,460
And I didn't eat breakfast.

6491
05:19:32,920 --> 05:19:33,460
So...

6492
05:19:33,460 --> 05:19:33,980
Um...

6493
05:19:33,980 --> 05:19:35,180
I kinda haven't eaten all day.

6494
05:19:35,340 --> 05:19:35,820
I had...

6495
05:19:35,820 --> 05:19:37,740
I had a protein bar for breakfast.

6496
05:19:38,400 --> 05:19:38,940
So...

6497
05:19:38,940 --> 05:19:39,980
I'm pretty hungry.

6498
05:19:42,280 --> 05:19:42,820
And...

6499
05:19:43,350 --> 05:19:43,620
Um...

6500
05:19:43,620 --> 05:19:43,860
Hahaha.

6501
05:19:45,440 --> 05:19:47,280
It's 8.30pm for me.

6502
05:19:47,580 --> 05:19:47,880
Hahaha.

6503
05:19:49,040 --> 05:19:50,060
Thanks for the fun stream.

6504
05:19:50,860 --> 05:19:53,300
Oh, sad I'm going to miss this week's stream due to company visiting.

6505
05:19:53,540 --> 05:19:53,760
No!

6506
05:19:53,900 --> 05:19:54,320
It's okay!

6507
05:19:55,360 --> 05:19:57,060
In case we finish tomorrow...

6508
05:19:57,060 --> 05:19:57,380
Here's a...

6509
05:19:57,380 --> 05:19:58,580
I will finish tomorrow.

6510
05:19:59,080 --> 05:20:00,240
Mark my words.

6511
05:20:00,560 --> 05:20:01,140
I will.

6512
05:20:01,260 --> 05:20:01,520
I will.

6513
05:20:01,640 --> 05:20:02,020
So...

6514
05:20:02,020 --> 05:20:02,800
We'll...

6515
05:20:02,800 --> 05:20:04,260
We'll reconvene tomorrow.

6516
05:20:06,340 --> 05:20:06,900
And...

6517
05:20:07,480 --> 05:20:08,040
Uh...

6518
05:20:08,040 --> 05:20:08,380
Yeah.

6519
05:20:09,020 --> 05:20:09,320
Yeah.

6520
05:20:09,520 --> 05:20:09,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6521
05:20:09,940 --> 05:20:10,820
We will finish the game.

6522
05:20:11,580 --> 05:20:12,280
And I'm gonna...

6523
05:20:12,280 --> 05:20:12,720
I'm gonna...

6524
05:20:12,720 --> 05:20:13,280
Same time.

6525
05:20:13,580 --> 05:20:14,800
Starting same time tomorrow.

6526
05:20:15,480 --> 05:20:16,040
And...

6527
05:20:16,040 --> 05:20:17,440
We'll get through it.

6528
05:20:18,880 --> 05:20:19,440
Uh...

6529
05:20:19,440 --> 05:20:21,760
There will be less streams this week.

6530
05:20:22,000 --> 05:20:23,900
So I'm apologizing in advance.

6531
05:20:26,640 --> 05:20:27,560
And next week...

6532
05:20:27,560 --> 05:20:30,380
Basically for May, there will be a lot less streams.

6533
05:20:30,380 --> 05:20:31,900
Since I'm pretty busy.

6534
05:20:33,280 --> 05:20:33,880
But...

6535
05:20:33,880 --> 05:20:34,880
Uh...

6536
05:20:34,880 --> 05:20:35,480
Um...

6537
05:20:35,480 --> 05:20:36,720
Come June, I'll be...

6538
05:20:36,720 --> 05:20:37,560
I will be...

6539
05:20:37,560 --> 05:20:38,600
Less busy.

6540
05:20:39,100 --> 05:20:41,580
So things will go more back to normal then.

6541
05:20:42,840 --> 05:20:43,480
And...

6542
05:20:43,480 --> 05:20:45,440
Come July, things will be even more normal.

6543
05:20:45,840 --> 05:20:47,160
Since June has some events.

6544
05:20:47,440 --> 05:20:48,280
Such as...

6545
05:20:48,280 --> 05:20:48,520
Off Kai.

6546
05:20:50,160 --> 05:20:50,660
Mm-hmm.

6547
05:20:51,140 --> 05:20:51,640
So yeah.

6548
05:20:52,100 --> 05:20:53,080
Okie dokie.

6549
05:20:53,560 --> 05:20:54,700
Thank you guys!

6550
05:20:55,300 --> 05:20:56,480
For Devil May Cry!

6551
05:20:57,180 --> 05:20:58,400
And we'll finish...

6552
05:20:58,400 --> 05:20:59,820
Tomorrow on...

6553
05:20:59,820 --> 05:21:00,820
May 5th.

6554
05:21:01,480 --> 05:21:02,980
Devil May Cry...

6555
05:21:02,980 --> 05:21:04,020
Devil May 5th.

6556
05:21:04,180 --> 05:21:04,660
Devil May 5th.

6557
05:21:04,660 --> 05:21:04,680
Yeah!

6558
05:21:06,980 --> 05:21:07,460
So...

6559
05:21:07,460 --> 05:21:08,140
I'm gonna go eat.

6560
05:21:08,320 --> 05:21:08,860
Thank you guys!

6561
05:21:09,120 --> 05:21:09,700
