1
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,170
Please, welcome back.

2
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,570
Hello?

3
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,470
Music is so...

4
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,450
Bink, bonk, bink, bonk, bink, bink, bonk.

5
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,170
Bink, bink, bink, bonk, bink, bonk.

6
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,580
For the tan gift, I thank you.

7
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,340
And I saw... I saw...

8
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,400
D-D-Demetrodon, thank you!

9
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,680
For the super tap.

10
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,360
Howdy!

11
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,100
Everybody.

12
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,620
Some kind of pirated Minecraft.

13
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,080
No!

14
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,360
This is real!

15
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,720
This is real!

16
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
This is not even a mod.

17
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,820
Guys, this is actual Minecraft.

18
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,160
Sorry, sorry.

19
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,640
Craft mine!

20
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,840
Speedyfire, thank you!

21
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,180
Chicken donkey!

22
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
Thank you for the gift, thank you.

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
Minky donkey.

24
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,200
No, Chicken Minky, I think, right?

25
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,360
Is that what... that's what...

26
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,520
I think Chicken Minky was the proposed...

27
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
...correct variation.

28
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,540
Chicken Minky.

29
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,160
Comfy Magus, thank you!

30
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,620
First we craft, then we mine.

31
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,520
What would the...

32
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,100
Music is so mysterious!

33
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:33,840
Um...

34
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
Before we do this, do you guys wanna...

35
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,940
You're a...

36
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:37,980
You're a...

37
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,400
What?

38
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,620
Can you explain why this waiting room was put up at 5am?

39
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,650
Uhhhh...

40
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,630
Why do I have to explain myself, huh?

41
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,370
I mean they're looking extra cute today.

42
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,670
Thank you!

43
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,510
Why do you know that?

44
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,850
Why were you up at 5am, huh?

45
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,070
Yeah, what were you doing?

46
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,310
Why did you notice?

47
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,210
That it was at 5am, huh?

48
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,540
Mint, as your lawyer?

49
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,420
You don't have to answer that.

50
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:25,800
Thank you!

51
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,540
I am...

52
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,900
Please talk to my lawyer.

53
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,560
What?

54
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,120
What's your name?

55
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,000
Where's my lawyer?

56
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,540
Pylons is my lawyer.

57
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,500
Looking good as always.

58
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,200
Thank you, Sulkin.

59
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,640
Thank you.

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,720
I could not sleep.

61
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh no!

62
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,980
Can you take a nap?

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,700
Do you guys wanna help me be a little girly?

64
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,100
Do you guys wanna help me pick some nails?

65
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm trying to buy some nails.

66
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,620
Like press on nails and I don't know which ones to buy.

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,200
I want your opinions.

68
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,360
Is that okay?

69
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,850
Of course.

70
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,710
Yeah?

71
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,290
It's okay.

72
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,490
The metrodon is a prehistoric creature that lived before the dinosaurs.

73
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,650
But it's actually more closely related to mammals than dinosaurs.

74
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,270
Wow.

75
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,150
Thank you for the fact.

76
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:18,730
Okay.

77
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,430
Hold on.

78
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,470
I'm gonna pull up the site.

79
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,940
Oh, here.

80
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,320
Okay.

81
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,500
So...

82
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,220
There's this site.

83
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,860
A lot of my friends and a lot of girlies get their nails from this place called Tomato Nails.

84
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,520
Okay.

85
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,280
We can't help you slay more.

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,220
You're already dead.

87
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,340
Wait.

88
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,740
What do you mean?

89
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,340
I can slay even if I'm dead.

90
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,340
I can be like...

91
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,480
Slay?

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:48,960
I'm cute.

93
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,440
I can...

94
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,960
I can...

95
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,660
But like, look how cute these are.

96
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,660
They're so stinking cute.

97
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,800
And I have a couple.

98
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,520
I've already gone through a lot of these.

99
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh, wait.

100
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,120
These ones are kind of cute.

101
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,080
Oh, but I'm not really like a My Melody fan.

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,720
Miffy!

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
Wait!

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh, I thought they were orange, but they're pink.

105
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,620
Wait.

106
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,030
Wait.

107
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,750
But they're orange, but they're pink.

108
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,950
I want the Miffy.

109
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,150
Hmm.

110
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,010
What's the brand?

111
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,550
Tomato Nails.

112
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,910
T-O-M-A-T-O-E.

113
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,710
Snails.

114
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,890
Maybe different variants.

115
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,230
I don't see it on here, though.

116
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,110
But I was looking at...

117
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,510
Not this one.

118
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,690
I was looking at these.

119
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,190
I like to get my nails pretty short because...

120
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,490
Like, this is...

121
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,210
This is...

122
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,150
Way too long.

123
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,710
I like...

124
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,630
Like, these look so much cuter shorter anyway.

125
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,970
Otherwise, they're just so...

126
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,530
In the way, you know?

127
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,430
These ones are pretty cute, I thought.

128
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,210
And they're like, pretty normal looking.

129
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,830
They don't seem like they'd be so...

130
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,010
Sounds like a nightmare to type with.

131
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:01,550
Oh my gosh!

132
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,310
They have...

133
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,690
They make, like, keyboards for people with long nails.

134
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,590
Or, like, they make, like, little keyboard extension things.

135
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,630
It's kind of crazy.

136
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,370
I was looking at these.

137
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,370
I was looking at these.

138
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,190
Arigato!

139
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,690
Arigato!

140
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,350
I just found out it's been one year since I joined the Wisps!

141
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:17,790
Time flies!

142
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,990
Thank you, Tanuki!

143
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,970
That's genius.

144
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,070
That's kind of crazy.

145
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,370
Ever wondered what happens when you mix hot lava?

146
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,610
L-l-l-lava!

147
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,530
Which...

148
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,810
They're 40 bucks?!

149
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,610
They're reusable.

150
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,390
So, once you wear them, you can take them off and reuse them.

151
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,590
As much as you want.

152
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,990
So it's kind of a bit of an investment.

153
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,430
And also, going to a nail salon and getting your nails done is way more expensive anyway.

154
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,230
Like... Nails like these would be like... I don't know, like... $150.

155
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,330
Okay, Minecraft.

156
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,530
I can't hear myself think.

157
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,770
Such a hassle, OMG.

158
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,610
I know!

159
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,270
I'm more of a consistent pattern for all nails, guy.

160
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,190
See, I'm not.

161
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,950
I like different ones on each nail.

162
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,590
Slaying men.

163
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,970
What's the drink for?

164
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,310
Also, ham!

165
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,350
Welcome to Bamboo Ship.

166
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:18,990
Thank you!

167
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,090
Mimicor!

168
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,390
Oh my god!

169
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,230
I can change your profile again.

170
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,990
Membership check.

171
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,610
Oh my gosh.

172
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,910
Nataniel, I love your profile picture.

173
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,870
There's a Teto version of the Lava Chicken song.

174
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,130
What does she sound like?

175
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,730
La la la lava!

176
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,430
Ch-ch-ch-chicken!

177
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,910
So I was looking at these ones.

178
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,490
But they only... They don't show them shorter.

179
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,270
But I really...

180
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,650
My favorite nail is this one.

181
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,270
Ones that look like little strawberries.

182
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,670
I also really like these ones.

183
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,130
And then I was looking at these ones.

184
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,750
I thought these ones were pretty cute too.

185
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,670
I don't know though.

186
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,590
I'm feeling this one.

187
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,730
It's so simple, but I don't mind it.

188
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,920
The berries.

189
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,960
Ch-ch-cherry bear.

190
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,580
Cherry berry.

191
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,300
Pearly pink ones are cute.

192
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,540
But so is Minky.

193
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,260
Stop!

194
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm a manly man and have no interest in...

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,560
I'm too pink!

196
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,780
Do the pink ones, it's so cute!

197
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,960
Simple is good.

198
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,720
This one?

199
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
Strawberry or the first one?

200
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,880
I think because I see these ones as short as they are.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
And I'm like, oh, they look good.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,580
Oh, look how cute the ribbon is.

203
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,220
Mint and steel!

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,540
I wonder what these ones would look like shorter.

205
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,140
Maybe they'd have to only do one heart instead of two here.

206
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
And then less strawberry.

207
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,240
Look how long they are though.

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,660
I can't deal with it.

209
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
I can't, I can't deal with it also because...

210
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,440
When you get these kinds of nails...

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,580
The...

212
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,300
The, this, the, this part.

213
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,780
The tip of the nail is like...

214
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,620
Not, it's kind of thick, right?

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,180
So when you're scratching, you can't properly scratch yourself.

216
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,040
And it also drives my cats crazy.

217
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
Because I like...

218
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,100
Try to scratch them and they're like, It's not, give it, it's not getting the itch.

219
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,680
Yeah, yeah!

220
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
They're so annoying.

221
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,040
Okay.

222
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,900
I will...

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,080
Oh wait, and these ones are cheaper!

224
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,400
Gosh, these ones are...

225
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
I mean, they're all handmade.

226
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,460
So that's why they're so expensive.

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,000
But these ones are cheaper even.

228
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,040
It's a sign.

229
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,580
There's also so many more.

230
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,540
I might keep looking.

231
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,660
I might not even...

232
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,000
Sorry.

233
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,040
These are so pretty.

234
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,840
Oh my gosh, these ones are so pretty.

235
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,680
Wow, the cherries!

236
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,720
Oh my gosh.

237
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,600
Pudding!

238
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,720
Oh, they're pom pom pudding!

239
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Wait, I love this one.

240
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Oh my gosh, it's so stinking cute.

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,740
These are so gyaru though.

242
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,980
They don't suit me at all.

243
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,970
What is this?

244
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,190
A reference to?

245
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,090
I have no idea.

246
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,270
I like how they can't put like the character names for legal reasons.

247
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,430
This one's cute too.

248
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,330
Oh wow.

249
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,710
Oh, it's so fall!

250
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,510
Froggies.

251
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,210
Catching a midstream at work.

252
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,230
Well, there's a fire.

253
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,890
A fire?

254
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,050
Be careful.

255
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,810
Oh my gosh.

256
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,810
Forest friends.

257
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,030
Look at the Kirby one!

258
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:53,950
Wait!

259
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,790
The clouds are so stinking cute.

260
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,970
Oh my god!

261
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,270
Wait!

262
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,630
They're so cute!

263
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,850
They're a little bright.

264
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,990
I feel like they should be a little like more pastel-y but...

265
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,350
Kirby!

266
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,550
Wait!

267
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,410
They're more Kirby!

268
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,930
They went on a Kirby binge.

269
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,670
These ones are so girly.

270
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,570
These ones are so girly.

271
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,190
Wow!

272
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,670
They're like Valentine's Kirby.

273
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,570
Stay safe.

274
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,370
Yeah, for real.

275
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,330
Wait, I love this.

276
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,570
I love blue nails and pink nails.

277
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,950
Okay, we'll play Minecraft in like two seconds.

278
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,670
They do look cute.

279
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,410
When do we jockey the chicken?

280
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,410
I hope we can make a world of just chicken jockey.

281
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
Buy them all before the tariffs hit.

282
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,120
I think...

283
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,800
Actually, I don't know where this person lives.

284
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,020
It might be safe.

285
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,260
I don't know, actually.

286
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,940
I love online shopping.

287
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,780
I also was looking at these ones earlier, too.

288
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,260
Oh yeah, see?

289
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
Here's the pearly ones I was looking at.

290
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,160
Wait, these are so pretty.

291
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,860
Oh, they have bunny.

292
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,260
Okay, I stopped.

293
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,020
I stopped now.

294
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,460
Thank you for helping me shop.

295
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm so indecisive.

296
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,420
I'm a freak.

297
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,860
Wait, what's that in reference to?

298
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,600
Stinking cute nails for stinky egg...

299
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,760
Not stinky egg cute.

300
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Anytime.

301
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,860
It was fun.

302
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,300
Doing a little girl stuff.

303
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,100
Little...

304
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,540
Little girly things.

305
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,900
You know?

306
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,240
Like, um, help me pick out my nails.

307
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,040
I don't feel like we did anything.

308
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,580
You did!

309
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,860
You validated my...

310
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,220
What's the word?

311
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,180
My decisions.

312
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm not still looking at them anymore.

313
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,380
Yes, I am.

314
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,200
Okay, I minimized the window.

315
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:13,820
Okay.

316
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,820
I minimized the window.

317
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,480
Okay.

318
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,440
Don't lie.

319
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,640
My craft...

320
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:21,680
My craft...

321
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:21,860
I know.

322
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,820
Craft mine.

323
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,400
Craft mine.

324
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,100
Craft mine.

325
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,720
So let's create a new world.

326
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,780
And this is gonna be our...

327
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,660
Craft mine world.

328
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,340
Minky.

329
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,080
Oh wait, no.

330
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,580
Chicken.

331
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Minky.

332
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,440
Why do I always spell it with a Y?

333
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,600
I wasn't meant to sell...

334
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,620
The door knob.

335
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,860
What the heck?

336
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,020
I am done.

337
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,980
Thank you.

338
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,200
Um, raise your hand if you've seen the Minecraft movie.

339
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,880
Oh, sorry.

340
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,320
It's not the Minecraft movie.

341
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,780
It's a Minecraft movie.

342
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,020
Which kind of scares me.

343
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,220
Does that mean they'll make more?

344
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,410
Raise your hand.

345
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,650
Oh, I'm seeing it this weekend.

346
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,970
I'm waiting until it's on the airplanes.

347
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,110
So that I can watch it during one of my trips to Japan.

348
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,670
So I don't have to go see it in the theaters.

349
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,850
I'm waiting till marriage.

350
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,330
Wow.

351
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:33,910
Oh my gosh.

352
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,370
Your first night together.

353
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,700
And you're like...

354
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,290
Hey, honey.

355
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,830
This is...

356
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,610
This is the start of the rest of our lives.

357
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,030
So...

358
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,290
Let's...

359
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,750
Let's...

360
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,010
Let's...

361
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,890
Let's start it off on the right foot.

362
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,870
And then you just load it up.

363
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,070
And it just starts and it's like...

364
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,210
When I was a child, I yearned for the minds.

365
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,410
And you just look at each other lovingly.

366
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,050
And a tear...

367
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,630
Single tear drops down your...

368
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,290
Your cheek.

369
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,670
Oh my gosh.

370
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,370
Wait.

371
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,350
Can we rewrite Metal Gear Solid 2?

372
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,010
Where Raiden and Rose...

373
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,630
Instead of fighting about King Kong...

374
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,090
They...

375
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,730
They instead fight about...

376
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,570
Something in the Minecraft movie.

377
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,010
And then they spend the whole night...

378
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,870
Watching the Minecraft movie together.

379
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,590
Did Kojima see the Minecraft movie?

380
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,770
Did he make a tweet about it?

381
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,670
I don't know, actually.

382
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,310
Okay.

383
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,350
We're creating our world.

384
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,250
So how this works...

385
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,990
Look at this.

386
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,470
This is not a mod, by the way.

387
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,510
This is real.

388
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,130
This is real.

389
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:46,970
This is real.

390
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,970
We watched a Minecraft movie all night long.

391
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,810
Oh my god.

392
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,850
He has yet to see it.

393
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,290
Dang it.

394
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,570
I want to see his tweet about it.

395
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,090
Oh, I guess it's not...

396
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,250
Out in Japan.

397
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,010
Yet, maybe.

398
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,790
Are we in the Matrix?

399
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,230
Welcome.

400
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,370
To Craft Mine.

401
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:07,970
Look at this.

402
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,410
Doors.

403
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,890
Yearn for the keys.

404
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,130
There's some doors here.

405
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,770
Or...

406
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,250
Maybe not here.

407
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,290
Oh, whoops.

408
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,310
There's like doors.

409
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,570
There's like something going on here.

410
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,910
Hey, baby girl.

411
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,890
Wanna come over to Flint and Steel?

412
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,570
And then there's this.

413
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,330
These are all the different worlds that we're gonna create.

414
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,030
Memory land.

415
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,730
Because...

416
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,730
Basically...

417
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,750
You create...

418
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,990
Worlds.

419
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,370
And then you...

420
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,330
Um...

421
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,850
I don't know.

422
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,890
I don't actually...

423
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,790
Understand all of this yet.

424
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,870
Quite very much.

425
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,850
So first, we're gonna craft our mine.

426
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,270
Right?

427
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,150
So, what we do...

428
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,770
Is we have to go in and we have to find...

429
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,370
Different ingredients to be able to craft different types of mines.

430
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,470
I now pronounce it chicken and jockey.

431
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,690
You may mine and craft.

432
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,010
Yeah!

433
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,050
Oh...

434
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,050
Wait...

435
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,290
If...

436
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,050
Uh...

437
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:09,730
Wait...

438
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,370
All who oppose...

439
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,210
Flint and Steel are forever hold your peace.

440
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,390
Don't you mine your craft first?

441
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,470
This is craft mine.

442
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,330
So we have to craft...

443
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,450
Actually, I don't even know if you can craft in this game.

444
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,110
Like, it's...

445
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,090
It's very strange.

446
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,330
So like...

447
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,290
This was made for April Fools.

448
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,930
So let's put in...

449
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,310
Frogs?

450
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,610
This is gonna be our first mine.

451
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,030
I hate arson.

452
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,030
So we crafted our mine.

453
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,890
And now we're entering the mine.

454
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,820
We're in the middle of the ocean.

455
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,340
So now we have to escape...

456
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,240
Our...

457
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,860
Oh, this is a crafter.

458
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,480
Can I...

459
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,400
Well, maybe I can...

460
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
Maybe I can actually craft things if I use this.

461
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,300
Can I take it with me?

462
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,900
Oh, I can!

463
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,480
Nice.

464
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,700
So now we have to escape our mine.

465
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,820
But we also have to collect things...

466
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,220
That will allow us to make different types...

467
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,460
This looks so normal, actually.

468
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,960
This is like the most...

469
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,500
Normal...

470
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,860
Mine...

471
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,580
Ever.

472
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,780
Okay.

473
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,100
Um...

474
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:40,770
Okay.

475
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,750
Everything looks so...

476
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,070
Normal.

477
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,270
Are there any froggies anywhere?

478
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,310
I put frogs in.

479
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:49,450
No.

480
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,090
This isn't a mine.

481
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:52,770
It's the sea.

482
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,110
I've only done these...

483
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,710
Like, I've only done a handful of these.

484
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,250
Just to kind of test out...

485
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,530
What the...

486
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,470
This was like.

487
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,270
So, I...

488
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,890
Um...

489
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,670
Have not been able to make the most absurd of worlds.

490
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,850
So, like...

491
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,550
See, for example.

492
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,950
Let's, like, break some of this stuff.

493
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,530
Nothing?

494
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:11,930
Really?

495
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,950
I'm trying to...

496
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,610
Game, I'm trying to give an example here.

497
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,270
Okay, never mind.

498
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,690
The game hates me.

499
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,190
Oh!

500
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,190
See, there's a frog!

501
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,770
Suspiciously normal.

502
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,450
I know!

503
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,430
It's kind of weird!

504
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,690
It's kind of weird.

505
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,430
There's a frog, though.

506
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,030
I saw him.

507
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,670
There he is!

508
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,610
Why...

509
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,170
Okay.

510
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,670
Why would a frog be in this biome?

511
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,410
Because we crafted it!

512
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,410
It is really suspiciously normal, though.

513
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,890
Oh, look at how many there are!

514
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,350
Hello!

515
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:42,970
Okay.

516
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,790
So, for example.

517
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,690
I'm trying to show you, guys.

518
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,810
I'm trying to...

519
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,450
Game, please!

520
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,590
Game!

521
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,690
Game, please!

522
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,850
Okay, never mind.

523
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,970
Let's, let's, let's, let's punch trees like you do normally.

524
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,090
This is how you...

525
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,250
This is, this is Minecraft.

526
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,730
No, craft mine.

527
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,190
Sorry.

528
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,730
Okay.

529
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,270
Maybe grass doesn't do it.

530
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,790
It does!

531
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,050
I'm just...

532
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,690
I'm trying to show you guys.

533
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:15,790
Okay.

534
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:17,610
Oh, yeah, baby.

535
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:18,910
Regular...

536
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,830
This is, this feels like home, no?

537
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,430
Is this a bit?

538
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:23,890
No!

539
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,870
I promise!

540
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,250
This is, this, I'm just...

541
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,190
It's real!

542
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,530
It's not a bit!

543
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:39,330
It's not, it's not, some of them, some of the, some of the grass has like a little border around it.

544
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,150
I promise you!

545
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:41,710
I promise you!

546
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,290
I'm not crazy!

547
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,210
We're in Craftivine!

548
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,290
Not Minecraft!

549
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,390
I promise!

550
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:50,730
It's different!

551
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,690
It's, it's different!

552
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,110
Sometimes!

553
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,310
Sometimes!

554
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,170
Sometimes it's different!

555
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,070
See, look!

556
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,210
I can't craft anything!

557
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,350
I think if I put this down though, maybe?

558
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,790
And then with the lever...

559
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:01,930
Wait.

560
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Wait.

561
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,580
Oh, wait.

562
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:08,960
No.

563
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,300
Hold on.

564
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,840
Put you?

565
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,060
Wait, why can't I, why can't I craft it?

566
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Bring this item to the mine exit to convert to experience.

567
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,020
What?

568
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,340
Wait, how do I, how do I craft it though?

569
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,180
See, this is why I'm confused.

570
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,080
Oh!

571
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,720
Oh!

572
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,940
Oh, like that!

573
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,040
Whoa!

574
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,720
Interesting!

575
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,420
Whoa!

576
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,320
Interesting!

577
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,940
Oh, see, see, see, see, see!

578
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,740
See these?

579
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:48,320
These are, these will be ingredients for, for create, now see, like, we could create a, a taiga biome.

580
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,020
Or a forest biome.

581
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,420
Like that, like that.

582
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,360
You see?

583
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,000
You see?

584
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,500
It's different, it's different.

585
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Craft mine.

586
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,500
So now, we have to collect, we have to collect different things.

587
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,700
And also, to, to be able to create different kinds of biomes.

588
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,880
Right?

589
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,020
Right?

590
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,240
And we also, um...

591
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
Whoa!

592
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,120
What is that recipe?

593
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,820
Wait, what?

594
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,960
What the heck is that?

595
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,060
Where's my recipe book?

596
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,100
Huh?

597
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,360
What's my recipe book?

598
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,560
Um...

599
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,520
Where'd the, where'd the sheep go?

600
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,440
We also have to find the exit.

601
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,520
Pink eye.

602
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,480
We need to start to talk about craft and mine and grass again.

603
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,460
It's real!

604
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,520
I promise you!

605
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,940
Okay, die.

606
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,260
Die, please.

607
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,040
Thank you.

608
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,420
Oh, I only have so much.

609
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:52,780
Okay.

610
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,080
Not you.

611
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,380
You.

612
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,640
Okay, we want the wool, because I want to make a bed.

613
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440
Wait, what the heck is that?

614
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,600
Wait, what is that?

615
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,520
What the heck is this?

616
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
A trophy?

617
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,740
Okay, neat.

618
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,420
I need one more white sheep.

619
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,860
And we got to find the exit.

620
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,740
I don't actually know how to find the exit.

621
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,660
I just kind of...

622
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,280
I just kind of wander around until I...

623
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,180
How do I...

624
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,460
Where's my recipe book?

625
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,100
You got to collect the trophies.

626
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,240
I got to be a gamer.

627
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,300
Sometimes you see like a little pillar in the sky and that's where the exit is.

628
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,020
Look for the giant beacon.

629
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:49,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

630
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,920
The bacon.

631
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,900
No more sheep, really?

632
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,820
No more white sheep?

633
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,440
We might die.

634
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,740
We might die, everybody.

635
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,040
No more white sheep?

636
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,060
Mito Jockey helping me finish up work week.

637
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,780
Good luck with work week.

638
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,260
My partner is a big, big fan.

639
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,940
It's her birthday today, so I would like us mostly you to sing happy birthday to her.

640
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,860
Name is Mira.

641
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,000
Of course, I can sing!

642
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,320
Mira!

643
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,640
Happy Birthday!

644
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,500
Happy birthday to you!

645
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,840
Happy birthday to you!

646
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,280
Happy birthday, dear Mira!

647
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,540
Happy birthday to you.

648
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,940
Happy birthday!

649
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,640
Thank you, Inazu.

650
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,800
Inazu!

651
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,020
For the Super Chat.

652
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,700
Thank you.

653
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,240
Hope you guys have fun.

654
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,560
Let's see.

655
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,140
Frog.

656
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,860
That doesn't help us much.

657
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,820
One white sheep!

658
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,160
Oh my god!

659
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,280
Oh!

660
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,880
He's mine!

661
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,720
I was just thinking, how do I get up there and get him?

662
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,000
But...

663
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,910
I won't let you drown!

664
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,670
Wait, where... Where... Oh.

665
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,150
Did I get it?

666
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,010
Oh, I got it!

667
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:33,770
Yeah!

668
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,930
We're safe, baby!

669
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,310
Thanks for a great year, boss.

670
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,410
Here's to many more!

671
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,450
Thank you, Platypus!

672
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,730
Thank you so much.

673
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

674
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,290
All right, we're figuring this out.

675
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:45,310
What?

676
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,160
It's... It's... It's kind of quiet.

677
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,480
Okay, hold on.

678
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,040
All right, let's see.

679
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,100
All right.

680
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,740
Let's figure this out.

681
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,180
You?

682
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,400
You?

683
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,980
Wait, uh... You?

684
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,940
You?

685
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,700
You?

686
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,780
Shoot, what's the recipe for bed?

687
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,060
What's the recipe for bed?

688
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,200
What's the recipe for bed?

689
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,900
Ah!

690
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,400
Ah!

691
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:14,720
Ah!

692
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,060
Ah!

693
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,060
Oh my god.

694
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,700
Yes!

695
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm so good!

696
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,180
Yeah!

697
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Yeah!

698
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,040
Okay, maybe we can make some weapons too?

699
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,880
Oh, oops.

700
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,760
Ain't no way.

701
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,240
I never remember any recipe ever, actually.

702
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,640
I think the only recipe I know by heart is a torch.

703
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,980
Hold on.

704
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,440
Yeah, I don't know.

705
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:41,820
What?

706
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,740
What's my...

707
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,640
I said I have stuff in my recipe book, but like...

708
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Where is that?

709
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,780
What's this?

710
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,840
Oh!

711
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,400
Pathfinder.

712
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,140
Stop hitting yourself when using eye of...

713
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,060
Eye of exit!

714
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,680
That's what... Oh, crafting.

715
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,840
That's what that is.

716
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,600
Interesting.

717
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,020
Okay.

718
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Well, how do I make it?

719
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,880
What did I even pick up that allows me to make that?

720
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,400
What?

721
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,660
What?

722
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,740
What?

723
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,660
Be careful if you're watching that movie with kids.

724
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,220
Oh, yeah.

725
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,000
I've seen them throwing stuff around and everything.

726
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,040
Yeah.

727
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,120
You need experience from clearing the world first.

728
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,120
Oh, okay.

729
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,600
So first we gotta get out of here.

730
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,380
Hold on.

731
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,300
I will sleep.

732
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,020
No sleep for you?!

733
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,580
No!

734
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,340
Wait!

735
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,440
What do you mean by that?

736
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,520
Oh, we're so dead.

737
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,280
Okay.

738
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,800
Nevermind.

739
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,380
Goodbye, cruel world.

740
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Not today!

741
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,740
What do you mean by that?

742
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,700
The exit's behind me.

743
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,720
This way?

744
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,580
How do you know?

745
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,300
Am I getting one guide?

746
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,300
Up that render distance.

747
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,020
Yeah!

748
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,220
Um...

749
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,260
Um...

750
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,600
Maybe we'll see it in the nighttime sky.

751
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,680
No, I saw it too?

752
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,160
You did?

753
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,120
They said they saw the beacon earlier.

754
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,680
This way?

755
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,920
Is it not the pagoda?

756
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,200
No, this is where we started.

757
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,300
I'm just casually...

758
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,680
Swimming along.

759
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,860
Will it actually not let me sleep?

760
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,300
Kinda messed up.

761
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,980
What do you mean craft?

762
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,840
Why are you guys saying craft?

763
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,280
Woah.

764
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:40,880
Woah.

765
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,600
Woah.

766
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,340
Woah.

767
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,200
Woah.

768
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,180
Oots.

769
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,620
Oots.

770
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,060
Oots.

771
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:47,940
Oots.

772
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,680
First beacon is very easy.

773
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,760
Is it?

774
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,080
Okay.

775
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:53,820
Hold on.

776
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,080
Well...

777
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
Sucks for my bed, I suppose.

778
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,560
Okay.

779
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,580
Craft!

780
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:03,840
Um...

781
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,080
So this way?

782
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,740
Is where you guys saw it?

783
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,720
Why is it so stinking quiet?

784
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,940
Okay.

785
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,980
No, away from the moon.

786
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,800
This way.

787
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,640
Okay.

788
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,640
Hold on.

789
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,560
Can I craft a boat?

790
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,660
That's a great question.

791
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,640
I should...

792
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:26,740
Oh.

793
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,040
I should be able to, no?

794
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,520
What is the...

795
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,240
boat?

796
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,580
Nope.

797
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,440
Boat.

798
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,980
Oh!

799
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,500
Yes!

800
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm so stinking smart.

801
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,140
Go away.

802
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,560
Alright.

803
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
Hell yeah.

804
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,560
Hello, Minto.

805
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,300
Craft mine?

806
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,060
Yes.

807
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,320
Yeah, it's exactly what this is.

808
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,180
It's craft mine.

809
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,040
Mm-hmm.

810
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,540
Anyways, how is everybody's...

811
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,040
day going?

812
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,680
How are you guys doing?

813
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,480
Everything all good and fine and dandy?

814
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,380
Minto jockey.

815
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,960
Oh!

816
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,540
Oh!

817
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,000
Did you guys see that?

818
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,600
Over yonder.

819
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,040
There it is!

820
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,300
That's our exit, baby!

821
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,220
Is it in the water?

822
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,300
No.

823
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,100
Is it underwater?

824
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,520
Why would they do that?

825
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,540
Why would they do that to us?

826
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,900
That's so messed up.

827
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,000
Um...

828
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,900
Where did I get this ice from?

829
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,460
Cool.

830
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,240
Okay, well, we have ice now.

831
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,780
So now we can...

832
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,180
do a taiga biome.

833
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,260
Forest biome.

834
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,560
Icy surface.

835
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,220
We even got a little trophy.

836
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,420
Cool.

837
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,920
Craft mine.

838
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,980
Okay, let's leave!

839
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,980
Oh, I'm gonna die before we leave, please.

840
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,960
Three...

841
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,840
Two...

842
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,480
One!

843
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,260
Woo!

844
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,780
Yay!

845
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,020
I hurried home to watch because Oomph told me you're being really cute today.

846
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,620
Who said?

847
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,800
Who said?

848
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,820
We got mine number one.

849
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,360
What do I do with this guy?

850
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,060
There we go.

851
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,360
Sheep dies?

852
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,250
Cool.

853
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:00,510
I'll do my best to see you during your moso box meet and greet sakura-kanis weekend.

854
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,610
Thank you!

855
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,170
I do have that.

856
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,050
Get slimed!

857
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,990
I wish I could remove some of these so that we could...

858
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:10,250
You know?

859
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,970
Let's do an icy biome.

860
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:12,770
Let's try that.

861
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,450
Floating island!

862
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:16,630
Wait, what?

863
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,530
What?

864
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,270
Best iris employees.

865
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,750
Thank you for the gifting.

866
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,310
Sick and twisted.

867
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,090
So true.

868
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,550
Just like having to work.

869
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,090
So true!

870
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,650
Ice surfaces.

871
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:36,830
Not...

872
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,110
Oh, wait.

873
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,190
We get two times XP.

874
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:38,490
Wait.

875
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,050
What is this going to be like?

876
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,310
Now I'm so curious.

877
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,810
Oh, I still had some XP.

878
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,390
I like how you can just...

879
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,550
It looks so ominous.

880
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,650
Like if you jump off, you'll fall and die.

881
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,490
But...

882
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,670
It's really nothing.

883
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,410
Here we go!

884
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,390
Are you guys kind of understanding how it works though?

885
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,610
It's...

886
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,710
It's neat.

887
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,930
It's different.

888
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,690
It's not at all what I expected when I...

889
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,350
Forgetting something important.

890
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,810
When I...

891
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:06,910
Oh!

892
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,550
Oh!

893
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:09,990
Wait.

894
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,650
Oh, the...

895
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,250
The...

896
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,930
Wait, what?

897
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,370
The ground is like ice, but it doesn't look like ice.

898
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,470
But everything is icy.

899
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,110
What?

900
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,910
Huh?

901
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,030
And then we're floating!

902
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,490
Oh my gosh.

903
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,300
Please don't fall.

904
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,540
Did I just...

905
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:35,700
Okay.

906
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,560
I thought I lost the lever for a second.

907
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,880
Oh, creeper.

908
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,020
Okay.

909
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,700
This is...

910
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,140
This is interesting.

911
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,840
Whoa.

912
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,560
Whoa!

913
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,240
Whoa!

914
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,580
Okay.

915
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,120
Let's just go along our merry way.

916
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,960
Yeah, don't fall.

917
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,360
This is probably the worst...

918
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,760
Biome to have...

919
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,880
Slippery with.

920
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,020
Or worst...

921
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,540
Map?

922
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,120
I don't know.

923
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,260
Okay.

924
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,900
Press U for upgrades.

925
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Oh wait, so I can actually use...

926
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,560
Oh, I only have nine levels though.

927
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,160
What the?

928
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,820
The first pioneers of flight weren't always successful.

929
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,170
Have you heard of the legendary crabbert?

930
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,750
I have not.

931
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,030
Wait, why am I a wildlife expert?

932
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,370
Maybe we go up top and we'll find...

933
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,210
Uh...

934
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,270
Let's punch some trees.

935
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,470
Sorry your Oshi Haley Joel husband got arrested.

936
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:48,990
What?

937
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:49,690
I...

938
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,790
Someone told me that yesterday.

939
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,890
I forgot to look it up.

940
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,070
What did he get arrested for?

941
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,290
Finally, my nemesis is put away.

942
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,790
Where he belongs.

943
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,810
I hope he never sees the light of day again.

944
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,020
For impersonating Minky.

945
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,520
He was partying?

946
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,480
Public intoxication?

947
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,600
Public intoxication?

948
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,680
Why do I feel like so many celebrities get...

949
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,400
Arrested for that?

950
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,040
Aw, come on Haley Joel husband.

951
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,460
It should have been something more interesting, no?

952
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,780
Come on guys.

953
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,500
His mug shots?

954
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,740
But I'm not gonna look at it.

955
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,780
It will terrify me.

956
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,240
I actually refuse...

957
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,260
To even entertain the idea.

958
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,400
Family dinner, but try not to scare her too much.

959
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,700
Thank you.

960
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,540
Oh!

961
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,280
Hello chicken.

962
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,560
Chicken jockey!

963
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,800
Chicken jockey!

964
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,480
Nice.

965
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,340
Nice.

966
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,540
I like how there's just like some deep slate.

967
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,440
Randomly.

968
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,280
Oh golly.

969
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,620
Whoa!

970
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,160
Okay, alright.

971
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,060
Um...

972
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,320
Let's make some...

973
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,140
Stuff.

974
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,820
What the?

975
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,540
What is this?

976
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:14,880
Oh!

977
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,520
Wait, my thing!

978
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,260
Amplified world.

979
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,200
What is that?

980
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,240
Okay.

981
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,300
Um...

982
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,560
You.

983
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,580
Okay.

984
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,940
Uh...

985
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,120
How do I make a sword?

986
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,830
Why can't they give me a recipe book?

987
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,770
This is so rude.

988
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,110
How do I make it?

989
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,290
Two planks, one stick.

990
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,930
What's the order though?

991
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:52,790
Like this?

992
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,350
Thank you.

993
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,370
Okay.

994
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,590
Very good.

995
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,230
Very nice.

996
00:38:59,230 --> 00:38:59,550
There's...

997
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,050
Uh-oh.

998
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,190
Uh...

999
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,790
There we go.

1000
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,470
Uh...

1001
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:02,790
There we go.

1002
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,770
And...

1003
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,230
Throw...

1004
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,990
Uh...

1005
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:07,430
You away.

1006
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,570
We'll keep our raw chicken.

1007
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,770
Aha!

1008
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,330
Ha-ha-ha.

1009
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,250
Wait.

1010
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,810
You know what?

1011
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,130
I'm...

1012
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,530
How am I supposed to find the beacon in...

1013
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,490
This world?

1014
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,830
Wait.

1015
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,430
Is that it?

1016
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:26,830
No.

1017
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,970
I think that's lava.

1018
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,390
Unless that's...

1019
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,270
I can't tell!

1020
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,830
What's...

1021
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,890
I can't tell!

1022
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,390
How am I supposed to...

1023
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:36,450
How am I supposed to...

1024
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,390
That's totally lava.

1025
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,390
Follow your heart.

1026
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,830
Well, I was gonna do that before and I almost lost it for real.

1027
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,050
Hmm.

1028
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,250
Hmm.

1029
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,090
I like how we're...

1030
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,070
Kind of...

1031
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,310
In the...

1032
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,710
Oop.

1033
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,610
This is...

1034
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,050
Strange.

1035
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,870
The...

1036
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,870
Slippery ground.

1037
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,550
And everything.

1038
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,010
How am I supposed to get over to some of these places though?

1039
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,410
Woo!

1040
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:05,370
Um...

1041
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:06,690
Okay.

1042
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,930
We must craft.

1043
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,510
Even...

1044
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,590
We must...

1045
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,410
We must mine.

1046
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,630
And...

1047
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,310
And...

1048
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,570
Do the various...

1049
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,290
Things that the game was designed for.

1050
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,190
Get the high ground.

1051
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,530
Yeah, I'm trying to get over there.

1052
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,250
Yeah, maybe we go over this way instead.

1053
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:23,410
Whoa!

1054
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,650
I like the floating islands.

1055
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:27,990
Actually, maybe I hate it.

1056
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,970
I haven't decided yet.

1057
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,850
Look, there's iron!

1058
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,950
See, that would be huge.

1059
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,230
If I...

1060
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,310
Well, I guess I could...

1061
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,630
Hold on.

1062
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,190
Hold on.

1063
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,630
Let's make a pickaxe.

1064
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,490
Let's make a pickaxe.

1065
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,110
Somehow.

1066
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,850
Guys, what's the recipe for a pickaxe?

1067
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,390
Please tell me.

1068
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,370
I know you'll be so kind.

1069
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:53,990
And tell me.

1070
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,650
I know you'll be so kind.

1071
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,410
Make the ice pickaxe.

1072
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,890
Doesn't she know how to...

1073
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,090
Nope.

1074
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,370
I don't.

1075
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,190
I don't know how.

1076
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,010
Three rocks.

1077
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,350
Oh, here we go.

1078
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,330
I'm telling you.

1079
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,510
I haven't memorized a single...

1080
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,110
A single...

1081
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,850
A single...

1082
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,550
I haven't memorized a single...

1083
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,790
Recipe.

1084
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,470
Besides torches.

1085
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,390
Because I just have my book.

1086
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,450
And I search it.

1087
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,050
And it's fine.

1088
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,330
I don't really have to.

1089
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,650
What mod is this?

1090
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,470
It's not a mod.

1091
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,590
This is craft mod.

1092
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,050
This is what they made for April Fools.

1093
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,590
So...

1094
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,170
Anyone can play it.

1095
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,730
Oh wait, I need another stick.

1096
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,250
Come back, come back, come back, come back.

1097
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,510
Oh, I memorized stick.

1098
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,830
I've memorized stick as well.

1099
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,250
And...

1100
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:55,350
You.

1101
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,730
And...

1102
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,070
You.

1103
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,210
Throw away.

1104
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,310
Alright, let's get some...

1105
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,960
I feel like someone is definitely gonna come after me.

1106
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,940
Boonga boonga stick.

1107
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,560
Yeah.

1108
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,260
Boonga boonga stick.

1109
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,700
Oh, I leveled up!

1110
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,700
Wait!

1111
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,700
Now I can actually unlock stuff, right?

1112
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,900
Oh, I'm scared.

1113
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,820
What if they...

1114
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,240
What if it, like, drops me into the abyss?

1115
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,680
Okay.

1116
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
Alright, we got some...

1117
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,960
So dark.

1118
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,480
Uh...

1119
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,660
Let's make some...

1120
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,380
Torches?

1121
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,060
Just in case.

1122
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:42,720
Like...

1123
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,120
I guess?

1124
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,500
I don't know.

1125
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,800
I feel like I'm playing Minecraft.

1126
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:46,940
Okay.

1127
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,710
I mean, technically, maybe I am playing Minecraft.

1128
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,250
But I feel like I'm playing normal Minecraft.

1129
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,070
Okay, you.

1130
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,810
S...

1131
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,710
Eye of exit.

1132
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,130
Oh, we could...

1133
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,030
Wait, speed run.

1134
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,130
Wait, but I think I have to...

1135
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,590
Okay, let's see.

1136
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,490
Need for speed.

1137
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,090
Maybe...

1138
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,030
Oh, pockets?

1139
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:15,810
That's big.

1140
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,410
Inventory crafting.

1141
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,710
Ability to craft in the inventory!

1142
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,330
Wait, how do I do that?

1143
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:24,090
Oh!

1144
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,290
Crafting.

1145
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:28,530
Whoa...

1146
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,210
Okay.

1147
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,150
Need for speed?

1148
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:36,750
Whoa...

1149
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,670
What did that do?

1150
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,330
Get off a flying star.

1151
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,950
What did that do to me?

1152
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,530
What did that...

1153
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,190
What happened to me?

1154
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:45,970
What happened to me?

1155
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,970
This is a fever dream.

1156
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,090
I know, I feel like I'm playing Minecraft for the first time again.

1157
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,530
Pockets...

1158
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:55,650
Inventory crafting.

1159
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:56,790
Whoa!

1160
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:57,970
How do I un...

1161
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,810
Crafting table!

1162
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,010
Is that the sun going...

1163
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,090
Oh, that's the moon coming up.

1164
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,870
Uh-oh.

1165
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,370
Guys, I think we'll die here now.

1166
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,870
I think we're gonna die here for real.

1167
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,010
Yeah, now we're crafting.

1168
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,070
Uh...

1169
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,090
Um...

1170
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,270
This is a crafting table.

1171
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,170
Light it up a little bit.

1172
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:30,690
I think we're gonna die.

1173
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,810
I'm scared.

1174
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:33,950
If I die...

1175
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:34,890
What happens?

1176
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,530
Okay, let's get...

1177
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,030
Let's go...

1178
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:40,930
Upwards.

1179
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,130
What I'm gonna do...

1180
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,410
Is...

1181
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,730
Hold on.

1182
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,610
I don't think I need these anymore.

1183
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,170
Oh wait, but I need...

1184
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,090
I need two spots.

1185
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:57,750
Oh!

1186
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,230
Wait, don't leave me please!

1187
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,930
You're my only hope!

1188
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:02,430
Uh...

1189
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,410
Okay, we'll use...

1190
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,790
We'll use my...

1191
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,550
Handy-dandy...

1192
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,570
Um...

1193
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:08,850
Planks...

1194
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,170
To go upwards.

1195
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,390
Like so.

1196
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,560
We're getting the high ground.

1197
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,800
Any beacon...

1198
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:26,700
Showers?

1199
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,380
I feel like it's gonna be this way then, no?

1200
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,300
I always hid in the trees at night.

1201
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,460
Beware of skeletons!

1202
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:33,940
I know!

1203
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:34,740
I'm scared!

1204
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,600
I'm so scared!

1205
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,160
Oh my gosh, I forgot that we have the slippery...

1206
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,760
The slippery...

1207
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,240
Ugh...

1208
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,240
Oh...

1209
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,360
Beacon...

1210
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,720
Beacon...

1211
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,300
I'm Crouch, so we should be okay.

1212
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,460
Don't tell her, Chad!

1213
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,300
Tell me what!

1214
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,440
What?

1215
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,140
What do you mean there are no skeletons?

1216
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:02,920
There...

1217
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,820
I think there are, no?

1218
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,280
Because I've had skeletons in some of my other ones.

1219
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,760
Um...

1220
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:09,980
Okay.

1221
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,420
Let me go...

1222
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,100
This way.

1223
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,920
She doesn't know?

1224
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,960
What do I not know?

1225
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,000
Oh...

1226
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Very careful.

1227
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,540
I think those are chickens.

1228
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,300
Yeah.

1229
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,880
She's gonna die!

1230
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,540
No, I'm not!

1231
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,500
No, I'm not!

1232
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,540
What are you not telling me, huh?

1233
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,600
She'll find out!

1234
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,360
I don't know what you're talking about!

1235
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,450
Maybe there are no skellies.

1236
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,330
Only Creeper?

1237
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,910
I see two of them, I think.

1238
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,410
It's kinda dark.

1239
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,460
Don't tell her she doesn't know!

1240
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,240
She doesn't know!

1241
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,400
What do I not know?

1242
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,980
I'm scared.

1243
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,100
You guys are scaring me.

1244
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,960
You guys are scaring me!

1245
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:13,620
Uh-oh.

1246
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,990
I'm almost out of...

1247
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,540
Block.

1248
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,640
Brick.

1249
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,040
Block.

1250
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,700
And...

1251
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:20,740
Jump!

1252
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,180
Gosh.

1253
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,200
Flawless execution, everybody.

1254
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,740
Where'd the Creepers go?

1255
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,320
Are they on my tail?

1256
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,720
Are they on my tail?

1257
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,220
It's coming.

1258
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,460
What's coming?!

1259
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:34,980
No!

1260
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,580
No!

1261
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,540
Don't say that!

1262
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,740
What?

1263
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,020
What is coming?

1264
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,420
I wish it would let me sleep!

1265
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,180
Why can't I sleep in the game?

1266
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,820
That must be an unlock, maybe, right?

1267
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,560
Let's see.

1268
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,020
Netherite?

1269
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,960
Who gets that far in this?

1270
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,260
Uh...

1271
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,740
I guess eventually, if you do enough unlocks, you can...

1272
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,460
Ho?

1273
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,320
You can...

1274
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:02,980
Um...

1275
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,000
Wait, this costs zero!

1276
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,180
You can play the game normally.

1277
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,280
You can scale super fast.

1278
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,300
Let's see.

1279
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,140
Oh, I have seven levels.

1280
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,100
Uh, crops, berry bushes, beehives.

1281
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,720
Have a chance of dropping extra loot.

1282
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,160
Okay.

1283
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,780
We're gonna unlock...

1284
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,580
All the basic stuff.

1285
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,080
What is School of Hard Knocks?

1286
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,580
Take your time when learning.

1287
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,620
What does that mean?

1288
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,220
Mm-hmm.

1289
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:35,860
Okay.

1290
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,100
Get more experience after each mine.

1291
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,440
Oh!

1292
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,380
Don't what?

1293
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,360
Wait, what did I do?

1294
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,940
These seem like debuffs.

1295
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,840
Wait, what happened?

1296
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,600
School of Hard Knocks is bad, why?

1297
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,520
Oh, I can't unlock it.

1298
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,440
I can't take it back.

1299
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,060
It's hard mode!

1300
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,240
How is it hard mode?

1301
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,480
Oh no!

1302
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,900
Guys, I think I messed up.

1303
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,600
But it said take your time!

1304
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,940
Um, oopsie.

1305
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,400
Okay.

1306
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,000
Those are bait?

1307
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,470
Your time was taken.

1308
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:22,670
Uh-oh.

1309
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,610
I messed up.

1310
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,870
I messed up.

1311
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,470
Can it become daytime, please?

1312
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:29,330
Game.

1313
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,470
I would like to restart.

1314
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,310
Oh well.

1315
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,580
Okay.

1316
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:37,620
Okay.

1317
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,900
I don't see any...

1318
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:40,780
Creepers.

1319
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,020
So I'm going to drop down.

1320
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,160
And...

1321
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,880
I'm going to...

1322
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,520
Run.

1323
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,060
Ouch!

1324
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:52,780
Run!

1325
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,340
Where did this egg come from?

1326
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:03,870
Okay.

1327
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:09,050
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1328
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,010
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1329
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:12,950
I'm running, I'm running.

1330
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,630
So far so good.

1331
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,070
So far so good.

1332
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,370
So far we're killing it.

1333
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,470
And I...

1334
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:19,610
Oh!

1335
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,230
There's one.

1336
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,490
Watch out for that guy.

1337
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:22,750
I'm so fast.

1338
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:23,490
I'm speed.

1339
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,870
Because of the ice.

1340
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,710
Oh!

1341
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,430
This is a great area to be!

1342
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,110
Nevermind.

1343
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,010
This is not...

1344
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:30,430
Wait!

1345
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:30,730
Oh!

1346
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:31,790
This is a bad area to be.

1347
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:32,790
This is very bad.

1348
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,330
Wait.

1349
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,350
Keep going.

1350
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:35,210
Just run.

1351
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,330
Just don't stop.

1352
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,830
Unless you reach the end.

1353
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:38,650
Of the edge.

1354
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:39,430
Dust.

1355
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,270
Oh boy.

1356
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,050
I can keep running.

1357
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:42,330
Wait.

1358
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:43,610
Oh!

1359
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,630
The creepers I think will not despawn in the sun.

1360
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,730
Which that kind of sucks.

1361
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,270
Don't look back!

1362
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,170
They're all like gathered.

1363
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,490
They don't even care about me.

1364
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,370
I don't see a beacon though.

1365
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:05,730
They don't care.

1366
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,630
They don't care about me.

1367
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,130
They're fine.

1368
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,230
They're minding their own business.

1369
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:09,930
Um.

1370
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:11,570
What?

1371
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:12,490
And uh.

1372
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:13,550
Where?

1373
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,450
Hmm.

1374
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,050
Yeah, they're having their own little party.

1375
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:17,590
Look!

1376
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,650
We're so high in the sky.

1377
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,910
We're about to touch the clouds.

1378
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,630
It's kind of exciting.

1379
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,160
Kill the cow.

1380
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,640
I couldn't.

1381
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,700
Actually, I'm gonna eat.

1382
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,200
Raw chicken.

1383
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,600
Oh!

1384
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,450
Made...

1385
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,110
I made goats!

1386
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,170
From the grass!

1387
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:45,970
Yippee!

1388
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:47,950
Okay.

1389
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,250
I wish...

1390
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,150
Oh!

1391
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,670
I can actually craft...

1392
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,990
Wait.

1393
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:52,690
Oh!

1394
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:53,210
I have...

1395
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,170
I have more...

1396
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:54,550
Oh my gosh.

1397
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,390
I have more inventory.

1398
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,290
Oh, this is great.

1399
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:57,270
Let's just unplug.

1400
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,330
Hello?

1401
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,130
What the?

1402
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:01,790
Um.

1403
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:03,410
Why did I freeze?

1404
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,840
My webcam died.

1405
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,560
Oh!

1406
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,820
My webcam's back.

1407
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,880
That was weird.

1408
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,100
That was weird.

1409
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,260
Herobrine?

1410
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,520
He's trying to sabotage me?

1411
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,400
Sabotage my game?

1412
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,580
Okay.

1413
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,580
More pockets is actually really huge.

1414
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,580
Because we can do so much more.

1415
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,380
Jungle biome!

1416
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,360
That's exciting.

1417
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,080
All right.

1418
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,140
All the stuff we want to keep, we'll put up in here.

1419
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,400
Why do I...

1420
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,180
Why do I...

1421
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:38,220
Guys?

1422
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,620
Um, what's happening?

1423
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,100
Hold on.

1424
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,620
What's going on with my computer?

1425
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,120
I'm being sabotaged right now.

1426
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:54,700
It's here!

1427
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:58,180
Hello?

1428
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,340
Hello?

1429
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,700
So weird.

1430
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,400
So weird!

1431
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:06,960
So weird!

1432
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,440
He's here!

1433
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,880
What if, like, you just heard...

1434
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,720
Actually, I think seeing him with no ambiance would be even scarier.

1435
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,840
So what does the hard mode actually even do?

1436
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,100
Is there a time limit for these...

1437
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,100
For these mines?

1438
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,800
Makes the game harder.

1439
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,160
Like, just hard mode?

1440
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,020
Oh, the sun is coming up!

1441
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,140
Yahoo!

1442
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,200
Yippee!

1443
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,640
Halves the XP you get.

1444
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,780
Oh, that's so lame!

1445
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,820
Um...

1446
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,840
Yeah, I made a mistake.

1447
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,540
But that's okay.

1448
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,560
Alright, I'm running for it.

1449
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:51,780
Move, Cal!

1450
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,060
Move!

1451
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,080
Moo!

1452
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,540
Uh, let's see.

1453
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:57,880
Quit!

1454
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,440
Quit!

1455
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,040
This feels like normal game.

1456
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,280
I'm just...

1457
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,920
But I'm looking for the beacon in the sky.

1458
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,220
Looking for any...

1459
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,260
What if it's down below?

1460
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,940
No, it would shoot up, right?

1461
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,160
It would shoot up into the sky.

1462
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:15,700
Right?

1463
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,400
Even if it's...

1464
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,020
Underneath the ground?

1465
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:19,700
Right?

1466
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,540
It's not me who sabotaged, I swear.

1467
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,680
It better not be!

1468
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,670
Moo!

1469
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,170
Oh no, I'm hungry.

1470
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:34,970
Time for kill.

1471
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:38,330
Oh yeah.

1472
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:39,390
Oh yeah.

1473
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:40,610
Time for kill.

1474
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,810
Time for kill.

1475
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,210
Okay.

1476
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,390
Oh, sorry.

1477
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:49,770
Oh!

1478
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,570
Chicken jockey!

1479
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,010
Chicken jockey!

1480
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,810
Chicken jockey!

1481
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,490
Poor chicken.

1482
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,730
Poor me!

1483
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,570
I need to eat!

1484
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,370
I need to eat!

1485
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,590
So I can escape!

1486
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,380
I don't think I can actually...

1487
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:17,700
Uh...

1488
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,000
I don't think I can actually...

1489
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:20,720
Cook...

1490
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,140
Yet.

1491
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
So we're just gonna eat it raw.

1492
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,180
And...

1493
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,600
Salmon...

1494
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:24,940
Uh oh.

1495
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,060
I was about to say, salmonella be damned.

1496
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:27,920
But um...

1497
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,800
Yep, I just got that.

1498
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,660
Wait, what is...

1499
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,460
What?

1500
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,440
Oh, hunger?

1501
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,600
Wait, no!

1502
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,060
No!

1503
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:33,620
No, please!

1504
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,480
I didn't think it would be true!

1505
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:48,410
Okay, hold on.

1506
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,860
Do you think I'm getting too far away from...

1507
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,260
From where it would be?

1508
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:00,920
Oh!

1509
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,080
Oh!

1510
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:03,660
Oh!

1511
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,020
Oh!

1512
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:04,900
Uh...

1513
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:06,800
Let's see.

1514
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,340
Maybe.

1515
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,880
Okay, we're good.

1516
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,460
Now that I can craft a little bit.

1517
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,280
Okay.

1518
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,000
Okay.

1519
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,920
Parkour.

1520
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,200
Actual...

1521
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,000
You can make that jump.

1522
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,120
I'm a baby.

1523
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,580
I probably actually could've.

1524
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
Especially with the ice.

1525
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,900
Should I head back?

1526
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,700
Parkour.

1527
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,300
I don't know how close it's supposed to be.

1528
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,680
How far it's supposed to be.

1529
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,600
Um...

1530
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:40,500
Hmm...

1531
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:42,460
Hmm...

1532
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,060
My second favorite thing after...

1533
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,100
Me though.

1534
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:45,660
What?

1535
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,000
Why would that be on your list?

1536
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:48,840
You!

1537
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,620
There are infinite exits.

1538
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,240
Just keep wandering.

1539
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:53,540
Oh!

1540
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,420
Thank you.

1541
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:54,720
Okay.

1542
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,600
That's good to know.

1543
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,380
We'll just keep wandering.

1544
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,280
We'll...

1545
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:58,980
And eventually...

1546
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,300
Whoa!

1547
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,560
This is so crazy to see.

1548
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,540
Whoa!

1549
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,500
Wowie.

1550
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:07,780
Okay.

1551
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,560
Just don't fall.

1552
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,120
I would do no such thing.

1553
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,760
I would do no such thing.

1554
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,780
Falling into a hole?

1555
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,740
Only...

1556
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,900
Noobs...

1557
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,260
Minecraft noobs would do that.

1558
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,480
Obviously.

1559
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,440
Imagine falling.

1560
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,340
Minky falling off.

1561
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:37,760
Okay.

1562
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,780
Uh...

1563
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,480
Oh my gosh.

1564
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,460
Wait.

1565
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:42,960
This is fine.

1566
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,300
I should probably kill more chicken.

1567
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,100
Sorry chicken.

1568
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:48,680
Oop!

1569
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,620
Wait, did I get a...

1570
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,920
I got a second trophy!

1571
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,800
Wow.

1572
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,100
This just feels like a participation trophy at this point.

1573
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,780
Thank you.

1574
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,160
Do you think I'll still get salmonella if I eat this?

1575
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,060
Raw?

1576
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,640
And I'm getting...

1577
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,300
I'm getting XP.

1578
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,960
So honestly...

1579
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,600
Chocominto.

1580
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,080
Ice, ice, ice!

1581
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,560
Bring that song back.

1582
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,480
As much as I like the...

1583
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,100
Doobie-chan...

1584
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,180
Song.

1585
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,320
Bring back Chocominto.

1586
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,040
Ice, ice, ice.

1587
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,010
Can't tell...

1588
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,110
Okay, there is Minecraft music playing.

1589
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:36,990
Sometimes...

1590
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,010
Just doesn't play.

1591
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,870
As it does in Minecraft.

1592
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,070
We'll find an exit everybody.

1593
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,270
I'll get you out!

1594
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,010
Trust me with your life!

1595
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:52,990
Do you trust me?

1596
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,790
Do you trust me?

1597
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,720
Maybe.

1598
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,880
Trust me.

1599
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,840
Okay, I'm gonna eat the chicken.

1600
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,860
I'll be fine.

1601
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,080
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

1602
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,220
Oh yeah, I'm fine!

1603
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,560
Oh yeah!

1604
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,620
Yeah, no poison for me today!

1605
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,780
I have...

1606
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,680
I have...

1607
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,780
Oh no!

1608
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,420
That's fine.

1609
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,300
We're going fast now.

1610
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,360
I got greedy.

1611
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,200
No!

1612
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,620
Why is it on fire?

1613
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,060
Oh, the lava.

1614
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,980
Guys, I don't think we're ever getting home.

1615
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,140
It's a lot of chicken.

1616
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,740
Yeah.

1617
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,020
Look at this, we're fine.

1618
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,980
And we're speeding.

1619
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,060
We're gonna find the exit.

1620
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,020
Wait...

1621
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,140
Oh?

1622
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,100
I'm seeing things now.

1623
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,180
Like I'm...

1624
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:02,480
Oh!

1625
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:03,000
Oh!

1626
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:03,620
This is good!

1627
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,360
I can get experience.

1628
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,050
Experience!

1629
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,170
Please!

1630
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:12,170
And...

1631
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,890
Maybe we'll get something for...

1632
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:14,190
Yeah!

1633
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:15,890
The iron.

1634
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:18,970
Iron.

1635
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:20,210
Oh!

1636
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,140
Good, good, good, good, good.

1637
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,060
This is good, good, good, good.

1638
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,760
This is only world two, you guys.

1639
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,340
I think I'm...

1640
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,100
I think I'm screwed.

1641
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,160
I'm not cut out for this life.

1642
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,540
I'm not cut out for this.

1643
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,220
I saw some more over here.

1644
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,280
Iron.

1645
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,080
You're doing...

1646
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,140
Great, Nita.

1647
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,640
You really think that?

1648
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,000
Maybe once we go through more worlds, we'll get used to it, but...

1649
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,200
Yeah.

1650
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,580
Might be a bit of a struggle...

1651
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,380
At first.

1652
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,940
We'll get used to it.

1653
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:09,920
Probably.

1654
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,540
And we're gonna get two times XP, because we're on the slippery slopes.

1655
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,260
Okay!

1656
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,380
Level five!

1657
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,040
Alright, we can unlock some more stuff.

1658
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,540
Alright.

1659
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,260
What should we unlock?

1660
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,680
We'll have to go through our little...

1661
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:25,940
Book.

1662
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:26,920
Our booklet.

1663
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,340
Whoa!

1664
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,500
There's so much iron!

1665
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,040
I mean...

1666
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,540
A coal!

1667
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,440
Iron.

1668
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,960
This is an iron.

1669
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,160
I made a...

1670
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:41,920
I made a whoopsie.

1671
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,240
This is coal.

1672
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,560
Black iron.

1673
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:50,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1674
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:51,440
Whoa!

1675
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,060
This is like...

1676
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,800
Actually, this might be like the biggest...

1677
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,040
Vein I've ever seen.

1678
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,600
Actually.

1679
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,760
That's insane.

1680
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,680
We got almost a full stack from that.

1681
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,580
It's craziness.

1682
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:02,820
And I...

1683
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,380
It almost led me to my death as well.

1684
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:10,650
Oh...

1685
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:11,690
The world is burning.

1686
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,090
Wait, how am I supposed to...

1687
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:16,890
Okay.

1688
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:19,570
Because...

1689
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:20,910
Uh...

1690
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,110
Uh...

1691
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:21,510
This.

1692
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:22,310
I need a...

1693
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,130
I need smelt.

1694
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,830
I need to be able to...

1695
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:25,530
Do this.

1696
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:29,790
So...

1697
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,130
I need...

1698
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,090
I need...

1699
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,210
I need...

1700
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,870
The thing that allows me to...

1701
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,230
Find a way out.

1702
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:44,610
I think...

1703
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,850
Maybe we should save up for the pathfinder.

1704
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,050
Hold on.

1705
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:56,710
I'll just keep digging.

1706
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:58,250
I'll just keep earning more levels.

1707
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,350
Level seven?

1708
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:03,510
Look, we're already there.

1709
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:05,510
We're too good.

1710
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:06,690
Good job, team.

1711
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,290
Good job, team.

1712
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:13,950
That hunger didn't even do anything to us.

1713
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:16,250
Just keep yourself alive.

1714
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:19,670
It's hard to do that when I'm dead.

1715
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:21,150
What?

1716
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:22,010
Oh, wait.

1717
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:25,010
Didn't they add like these little logs in the new update?

1718
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,250
It looks so stupid.

1719
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,570
Have you come closer to a decision about redoing your lease?

1720
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,570
I'm not thinking about it.

1721
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,630
They actually called me this morning.

1722
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:38,670
They were like, um, hi?

1723
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,050
Hello?

1724
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,650
What are you gonna do?

1725
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:42,570
I was like, uh...

1726
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,750
I'll let you know.

1727
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,190
More.

1728
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:46,190
Coal.

1729
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,650
I don't think it looks stupid.

1730
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,290
I think it looks a little silly.

1731
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,550
I like it though.

1732
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:53,890
A stupid affectionate.

1733
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,370
Stupid affectionate.

1734
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:01,190
If we just keep going straight, we're bound to hit one.

1735
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:02,850
Something.

1736
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:09,390
I don't even know what the recipe is though for the pathfinder.

1737
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:11,610
I don't even know.

1738
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,190
Don't fall.

1739
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:16,830
Oh!

1740
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:17,890
Don't fall.

1741
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:25,600
Okay.

1742
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:26,660
You're useless.

1743
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,080
Give me, give me...

1744
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,280
Experience, please.

1745
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,420
Thank you.

1746
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,820
I need so much...

1747
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,480
I have so much coal.

1748
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,460
Level eight.

1749
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,400
All right.

1750
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:42,800
Let's go.

1751
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,640
Let's just keep going for now.

1752
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:51,660
I'm...

1753
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:51,940
I'm...

1754
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:52,460
I'm...

1755
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,260
I'm a wanderer.

1756
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,940
I don't like being stuck in one place for too long.

1757
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,400
Please don't make me hungry.

1758
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,360
Please don't poison me.

1759
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:00,820
Chicken!

1760
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:01,920
Yes!

1761
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,180
The chicken was clean.

1762
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,400
Is there a wonder a way to...

1763
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,200
I wonder if you can get to the edge of the world.

1764
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:14,700
Okay.

1765
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,740
I'm gonna mine in here.

1766
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,860
And hope that nothing spawns.

1767
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,560
No salmonella for us, baby.

1768
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:22,780
Our stomach has been hardened.

1769
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:24,500
Our...

1770
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:25,860
Our...

1771
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,000
Our...

1772
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,920
Uh...

1773
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,200
Everything.

1774
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,280
Our body is...

1775
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,240
Evolved.

1776
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,840
We've beyond...

1777
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,660
We've gone beyond.

1778
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:35,640
We don't...

1779
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,580
We don't need...

1780
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,180
To worry about it anymore.

1781
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,220
This is the future of human evolution.

1782
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,560
Steel gullet minto.

1783
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,180
You're welcome.

1784
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,920
Iron stomach upgrade.

1785
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,480
Can you imagine if they actually did that?

1786
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,580
What if we...

1787
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:56,580
Actually, I just realized.

1788
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,180
If we unlock the thing that allows us to...

1789
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:01,600
Um...

1790
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,000
Just put that out there.

1791
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,380
That allows us to...

1792
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,400
Cook.

1793
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,480
Like, for the iron and stuff.

1794
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,180
We can...

1795
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:09,500
Oh!

1796
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,280
That scared me.

1797
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,660
We can also...

1798
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,860
Make our...

1799
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,020
Food.

1800
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,040
Oh, I need stick.

1801
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,620
Wait, I can make stick here.

1802
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,600
Yes.

1803
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,600
Okay, then.

1804
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,780
You and two stick.

1805
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,060
Perfect.

1806
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,200
Perfection.

1807
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,080
Oh.

1808
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,120
Wow.

1809
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,200
Rude.

1810
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,100
Let her cook.

1811
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,620
Let her cook.

1812
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,580
I feel...

1813
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,120
Maybe the...

1814
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:43,580
Way...

1815
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,400
The path...

1816
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,700
We're only on the second world.

1817
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:47,680
Okay!

1818
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,700
One more level!

1819
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,820
Let her craft.

1820
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,240
Chicken jockey.

1821
01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:59,690
She isn't cooking.

1822
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,010
Yeah, because I've been...

1823
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:01,830
I've been...

1824
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,010
Banned from doing so.

1825
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,360
This is gonna be a long stream.

1826
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,120
What if we just never make it out of here?

1827
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,640
I'm stuck in this hell.

1828
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,520
Someone...

1829
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,500
God, please help me!

1830
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,180
As long as I don't get ambushed.

1831
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,920
I don't even need the coal anymore.

1832
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,380
Please.

1833
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,220
Give me the XP.

1834
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,560
Just give me the XP!

1835
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:33,800
Okay.

1836
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,080
Oh, I heard something walking in the...

1837
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,540
I heard something walking in the...

1838
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:47,710
In the...

1839
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:48,470
In the dirt.

1840
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,610
You guys hear that?

1841
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,510
What is that?

1842
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:03,790
I don't see anything there.

1843
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:06,630
Is it a chicken?

1844
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:09,750
Run!

1845
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,070
What's there?

1846
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,410
That was actually so freaky.

1847
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Chicken jockey!

1848
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,840
Wait, we...

1849
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,300
What if we make a whole world full of chicken jockey?

1850
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,750
Maybe it's down here.

1851
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:31,650
Maybe...

1852
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,090
Oh, maybe it's these three creepers.

1853
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,370
Yeah, it's definitely them.

1854
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,290
You guys are so noisy.

1855
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,130
So much for creeping.

1856
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:43,550
Okay.

1857
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:46,070
Okay.

1858
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:47,470
Uh...

1859
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,210
I'm trying to think of what I want to do.

1860
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:52,490
I guess I just...

1861
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:53,510
Let me take this back.

1862
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,360
And I think we're just going to keep on running.

1863
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:03,240
After I am gone from this world without the ice anymore, I'm going to be so sad.

1864
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,520
We'll be so slow.

1865
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,660
Yeah, I think I should just...

1866
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,480
Can you make a crafting table yet?

1867
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,220
Actually, did I unlock that?

1868
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,360
Oh, I did!

1869
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,280
I did unlock that.

1870
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,560
So, yes.

1871
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,160
Oh, I don't really need this crafter anymore, right?

1872
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,140
Ah!

1873
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,260
That feels so good!

1874
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:27,780
Yeah!

1875
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,140
Yeah, baby!

1876
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,720
I love recipe book!

1877
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,180
I don't care about anything else!

1878
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,400
Wait.

1879
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:38,900
Oh, wait.

1880
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:39,200
Come here.

1881
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:39,420
Come here.

1882
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:39,500
Come here.

1883
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:39,680
Come here.

1884
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,460
Can I craft a...

1885
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:42,840
What?

1886
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:43,120
Oh!

1887
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:43,760
You!

1888
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:43,780
Cool!

1889
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,300
Okay, we're going to need... Let's get some stone.

1890
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:53,050
I imagine it'll let us craft it, even if...

1891
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:55,730
It's like...

1892
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,050
You have to unlock it?

1893
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,810
I'm not quite... I don't know how this works.

1894
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,730
It's kind of strange.

1895
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:00,690
Wait, yeah.

1896
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:00,930
See?

1897
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,390
We can... We can still craft it.

1898
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,690
Hole?

1899
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:04,990
Huh?

1900
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:05,990
Huh?

1901
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:07,690
Huh?

1902
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,750
Whoa!

1903
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:10,830
Whoa!

1904
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:10,830
Yeah!

1905
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:11,890
Evolution!

1906
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,910
Let's make... Let's get some more iron.

1907
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:19,710
We can make...

1908
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:20,870
We can make armor!

1909
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:26,010
Quinta without a recipe book is like a Zoomer that can't remember phone numbers.

1910
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,570
You know what?

1911
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:33,450
Anyone else would be offended, but I find that to be an apt description.

1912
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:38,430
I find that to be pretty accurate, not gonna lie.

1913
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,240
There's a creeper right there.

1914
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,620
We're gonna have to be careful of that guy.

1915
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:49,600
As long as he doesn't encroach on our territory, we'll be okay.

1916
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,000
I actually can't remember phone numbers, though, really.

1917
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,200
I can't even remember my own phone number.

1918
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,040
Well, I'm very bad at remembering numbers in general.

1919
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:06,100
And so, if I get into a high-stress situation, which is talking to people, I can't remember my phone number, and I always have to...

1920
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,580
I'll be like, oh, sorry, I got a new phone number recently.

1921
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:14,600
So I have to look it up, even though I've had my phone number for like three years.

1922
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,880
I'll be like, oh, sorry, yeah, I just got it.

1923
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,560
I can't remember it just yet.

1924
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,230
That happens way often.

1925
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:32,640
Same.

1926
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,520
I'm glad that we're all in the same...

1927
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,480
We're all in the same boat together here.

1928
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,360
Numbers hard.

1929
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,980
Numbers hard, you guys.

1930
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,300
All right, we're really cooking now.

1931
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,500
We're really cooking...

1932
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,360
Woo-hoo!

1933
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,080
Oh!

1934
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:50,500
Oh!

1935
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:50,920
Oh!

1936
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:51,880
Ten!

1937
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:52,540
Ten!

1938
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,800
What do I do?

1939
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,080
Pathfinder.

1940
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:57,400
Wait.

1941
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,280
Oh, we have a recipe book now.

1942
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,500
So path...

1943
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,200
Oh, this thing!

1944
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,640
Eye of exit.

1945
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,900
I need copper?

1946
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,480
Okay.

1947
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:15,020
Okay.

1948
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:15,540
Oops.

1949
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,680
Let's make some armor.

1950
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,840
Just in case the creeper comes up.

1951
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,100
I don't have armor slot!

1952
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:25,900
Just kidding.

1953
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,760
Abort, abort, abort.

1954
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:31,780
Hey.

1955
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,040
Hey, mister.

1956
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,120
This area is taken.

1957
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,140
Don't look at me.

1958
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,140
Yeah, turn around.

1959
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,080
Hold it and click.

1960
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:44,140
Okay.

1961
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,300
Click?

1962
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,280
No.

1963
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,160
I don't think so.

1964
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,340
Or hold?

1965
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,420
Like here?

1966
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,180
Ow!

1967
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,280
Oh!

1968
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,440
Oh!

1969
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,760
Oh my god.

1970
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,660
Oh my god, we're cheating the system.

1971
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,260
We're cheating the system.

1972
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,180
We're cheating the system.

1973
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,600
Let's go.

1974
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,200
The way they didn't think of that.

1975
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,300
How is she so smart?

1976
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,620
Because you guys tell me.

1977
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,140
You guys make me so smart.

1978
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,580
You guys make me into a genius.

1979
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:35,880
Okay.

1980
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:36,680
All right.

1981
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,000
Copper, I don't think is even possible.

1982
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,520
I don't think we'll ever find that.

1983
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:49,540
So, um, I guess here, once we smelt all of our iron, we'll make a full suit, we'll make a sword.

1984
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:50,560
A ship.

1985
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:52,100
What?

1986
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,980
Well, I just need pants and feet, right?

1987
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,380
And pants.

1988
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:02,940
Oh, I don't know.

1989
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,040
Actually, I think we have enough.

1990
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,640
And then we'll continue onward.

1991
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,440
And I wonder if I can make a shield.

1992
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,980
Should be able to.

1993
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,520
Let's go, uh...

1994
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,360
Chop some tree.

1995
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,340
Chop some tree.

1996
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,540
Chop, chop, chop.

1997
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,640
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

1998
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:32,120
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

1999
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,420
How goes the craft mine?

2000
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:37,640
Um...

2001
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:41,880
I think we're okay.

2002
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,400
Right, guys?

2003
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,180
I think we're okay.

2004
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,120
Maybe.

2005
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,580
Let it go.

2006
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,840
We're gonna make it to world three, for sure.

2007
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,440
Trust.

2008
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:01,620
Trust.

2009
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,940
Trust will make it to world three.

2010
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,440
What was I making?

2011
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:08,920
Oh, a shield.

2012
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:10,940
Yeah, baby.

2013
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:12,760
Yeah, baby.

2014
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:17,640
I've made it to level one.

2015
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,520
And shield.

2016
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,180
And...

2017
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:24,760
Give me...

2018
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,420
A sword, and we'll be good to go, baby.

2019
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,080
Sword.

2020
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,120
Yahoo!

2021
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,950
We are never making it out.

2022
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:39,810
Yes, we are!

2023
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:42,650
I'm hoping we make it to world five.

2024
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:43,490
Whoa!

2025
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:45,250
We have really high expectations.

2026
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:46,190
You know what?

2027
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:48,350
I love that.

2028
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:49,690
I love that.

2029
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:51,170
I...

2030
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,250
I really love that.

2031
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:57,170
You're like, yeah, we're gonna make it to world five.

2032
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:58,070
Probably.

2033
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:02,330
I love that.

2034
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,930
I love that you're thinking...

2035
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,110
You're thinking big, lofty goals here.

2036
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,910
Let's go slaughter some animals.

2037
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:14,090
Chicken.

2038
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:16,710
More chicken.

2039
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:17,630
Sorry, family.

2040
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:18,650
Sorry.

2041
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:19,310
Sorry.

2042
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,190
Wait, I'm not even picking up the chicken.

2043
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:22,390
Uh...

2044
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,890
Go wait.

2045
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:25,390
Yes.

2046
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:28,750
Slaughter the families.

2047
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,810
Alright, let's cook.

2048
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,950
We can actually cook now.

2049
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,750
Let me cook.

2050
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,010
Love your long craft mine Minecraft streams.

2051
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,590
Thank you, Kamenachi.

2052
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:43,390
It's been a minute since we played Minecraft.

2053
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,810
I hope...

2054
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:45,550
I hope...

2055
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,350
I hope soon I can play in like a world with...

2056
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:48,150
With people.

2057
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:49,550
And friends.

2058
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,550
And stuff.

2059
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,670
That's always fun.

2060
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:54,490
Look, we're even...

2061
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,650
We're getting experience for that.

2062
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,030
Yes.

2063
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,640
You can drop the crafter now.

2064
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:03,340
I...

2065
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:03,920
Will...

2066
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:04,900
Keep it?

2067
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:05,980
Just because...

2068
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:06,640
What if...

2069
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,360
Well, I won't remember a recipe, will I?

2070
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,160
I won't remember the recipe.

2071
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:10,780
I think you're right.

2072
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,520
We'll drop it.

2073
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,340
I was gonna say, what if I...

2074
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,420
What if I...

2075
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,240
What if I...

2076
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,680
Want to make something that I don't have the recipe for?

2077
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,620
If I don't have the recipe...

2078
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,040
I don't know it.

2079
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,860
I'm not gonna know it at all.

2080
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,440
Some pumpkin.

2081
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:36,520
I think I've completely forgotten what the plot is of this.

2082
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,180
Instead, we're just like running around.

2083
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,020
I'm trying to see if I can unlock any pumpkin.

2084
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:42,820
Pumpkin world.

2085
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,020
No?

2086
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:45,420
Nothing?

2087
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:45,900
Really?

2088
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,200
Lame?

2089
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:47,520
Okay.

2090
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:52,760
Copper!

2091
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,940
I don't think we're gonna get it.

2092
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:56,280
Wait!

2093
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,940
Did I see?

2094
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:58,800
No.

2095
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,060
My eyes must have deceived me.

2096
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,520
Unless...

2097
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:07,600
Unless...

2098
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,520
I think my eyes deceived me.

2099
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,440
Let's go this way.

2100
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,100
When you want copper, you never find...

2101
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:21,560
I know!

2102
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:27,400
I think it's just also we're in like a type of environment where copper is not going to...

2103
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:28,840
Spawn.

2104
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,200
This isn't...

2105
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,040
I think you guys are messed up.

2106
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
I think we're never getting out of here.

2107
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,920
There's no way!

2108
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:39,840
Please!

2109
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:41,880
Please!

2110
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:44,980
Please!

2111
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,190
Please get me out of here!

2112
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:54,630
I'm sick of this world!

2113
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,630
I'm tired of this world!

2114
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,510
This is where we live now.

2115
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:05,490
No!

2116
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:08,890
Okay.

2117
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:11,450
The reason, if you're curious why I'm not picking it up...

2118
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,690
I'm trying to get things to see how...

2119
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:13,530
Sorry, it's hard to tell.

2120
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,310
They have like the little...

2121
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:18,570
Not crosshairs, but the little blocky things around them.

2122
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:20,690
That means you can...

2123
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:25,570
Use it as like a world builder in a future world.

2124
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,670
So that's why I'm like...

2125
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,530
Wanting to collect...

2126
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:31,570
That.

2127
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:34,290
So that I can...

2128
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,490
Maybe make it...

2129
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:38,250
Like use it for crafting a mine.

2130
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:39,330
Our next mine.

2131
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:41,150
Yeah, they're like seeds!

2132
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2133
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,110
Exactly, exactly.

2134
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:46,050
Where's...

2135
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,090
The exit?

2136
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,250
I think it should...

2137
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,130
Oh my god!

2138
01:19:52,510 --> 01:19:53,310
Oh my god!

2139
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:54,410
Exit!

2140
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:55,570
Oh my god!

2141
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:56,390
Oh my god!

2142
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:57,590
Wait, this is not a drill.

2143
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,410
This isn't...

2144
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,010
This is for real.

2145
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:00,050
I see it!

2146
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:01,490
I see it!

2147
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:05,630
Yeah!

2148
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:09,470
I'm gonna go around.

2149
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:13,180
Oh my god!

2150
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,580
We're free!

2151
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,340
Wait, don't disappear on me.

2152
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:18,920
Don't...

2153
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:19,780
Don't leave me!

2154
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:20,840
Batman meme.

2155
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,140
Don't leave me!

2156
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,180
Oh my god!

2157
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,360
Oh my god!

2158
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,620
Oh my...

2159
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:33,750
Made it out of here!

2160
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,390
Is there anything else we can collect...

2161
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,590
For like experience on our way out?

2162
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,970
You know?

2163
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:41,170
Um...

2164
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,750
Oh, this gives us a lot of experience.

2165
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,700
I wonder if there's anything else.

2166
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,600
Never doubted.

2167
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,100
Yeah!

2168
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:51,100
Yippee!

2169
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,500
Yippee!

2170
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,560
Trying to see what other like kind of material...

2171
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,260
I guess I'm mostly full anyway, so...

2172
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:58,420
Okay.

2173
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,350
The music just started.

2174
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,750
Whoa, it's really pretty.

2175
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,480
Let's go home.

2176
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,380
Oh, finally!

2177
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:23,720
We're saved!

2178
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,260
One!

2179
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:26,880
Whoa!

2180
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:27,740
Whoa!

2181
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,380
Yeah, baby!

2182
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:36,900
Oh my gosh!

2183
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,720
24!

2184
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,080
24!

2185
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,900
24 levels.

2186
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,980
Oh.

2187
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,300
Did I get all of it?

2188
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,440
Alright, let's put our...

2189
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,080
Now these doors are so mysterious, right?

2190
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,620
The door yearns for the keys.

2191
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:53,360
Like...

2192
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:53,960
What...

2193
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,980
What happens...

2194
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:55,860
How do you get a key?

2195
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,000
What if you...

2196
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,260
What happens when you open it?

2197
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,420
No way, I got three chicken trophies.

2198
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:08,960
Okay.

2199
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:09,820
Okay.

2200
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,360
Okay.

2201
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:10,680
Okay.

2202
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:11,620
No.

2203
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,300
No.

2204
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:13,940
No, please.

2205
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,500
Please don't be...

2206
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,240
Um...

2207
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:17,620
Amplified world.

2208
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,040
Oh, I can't do that one.

2209
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,740
Mine exits are found on the surface.

2210
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,020
Okay, so that's already...

2211
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,800
That's already a given.

2212
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,700
I guess we're doing an...

2213
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:28,900
Amplified...

2214
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,120
Creepers?

2215
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,180
Let's do...

2216
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,160
Oh, I can't do slimes.

2217
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,160
We can do...

2218
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,420
Uh...

2219
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,500
I wanna get more interesting things.

2220
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:38,180
Hmm.

2221
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,660
We lost our armor.

2222
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,420
That's okay.

2223
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:42,840
Look, ghasts.

2224
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,860
Eternal rain.

2225
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,720
Win an eternally dark mine.

2226
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:47,440
What?

2227
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,480
Oh, sorry.

2228
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,500
If you heard that, that's my cat going into a bag.

2229
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,420
Pies, what are you doing in there?

2230
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:55,840
I have...

2231
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,000
I have like a paper bag on the ground that she likes to lay inside.

2232
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,120
Can you hear it?

2233
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,180
Let...

2234
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,220
Oh, grid world!

2235
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:07,980
Wait, that's...

2236
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:08,800
That's just...

2237
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,860
That's just parkour.

2238
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,920
That's just Minecraft parkour.

2239
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,700
Jump from really high up.

2240
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:15,940
Okay.

2241
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,900
There's like hints on how you...

2242
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,920
How you can get these, which is kind of fun.

2243
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,680
Walk on this block and give of...

2244
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:23,860
Give...

2245
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:24,880
Of...

2246
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,400
A char...

2247
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:25,760
A char...

2248
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,520
Do you mean off?

2249
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,880
Is this a typo?

2250
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,260
It's a nice crystal, but not even worth a dime.

2251
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:33,020
Striders.

2252
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:34,920
Please.

2253
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,000
There's a lot of undiscovered.

2254
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,320
Yeah, parkour civilization!

2255
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,880
That's what that one is.

2256
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,520
Guardians!

2257
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,260
Use 20 of your experience to work towards upgrading the Minecrafter table.

2258
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:50,980
Oh!

2259
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:51,880
Oh!

2260
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:52,620
Interesting.

2261
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,980
Okay, so our base...

2262
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,140
Don't step on the pine cones.

2263
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,480
What else should we do?

2264
01:23:59,160 --> 01:23:59,760
Goats?

2265
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,080
Paper?

2266
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:05,660
Creeper?

2267
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,410
Little girl, what are you doing?

2268
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:13,710
Goats and slippery.

2269
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:21,350
I think if you don't put in a specific mob...

2270
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:25,310
Like the creeper, then it will be all of them.

2271
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:27,310
So...

2272
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:30,330
You always want to make me happy.

2273
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:30,710
Thank you!

2274
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:33,310
I'm just...

2275
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:33,750
I'm just...

2276
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:34,730
Messing around.

2277
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,190
Do the creeper one.

2278
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,430
I feel like the creeper would be good, no?

2279
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:43,510
Then we could do...

2280
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,090
Or slimes.

2281
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,090
We could do slimes.

2282
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:47,190
Oh, I can't do slimes.

2283
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:47,790
Oh, wait.

2284
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:49,930
For some reason it won't let me...

2285
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:50,990
Maybe...

2286
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,550
I don't know why it won't let me.

2287
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:53,190
Okay.

2288
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:54,410
Let's try this one.

2289
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:55,210
I don't know...

2290
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:55,670
Oh, whoops.

2291
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:56,990
I don't know what this will make.

2292
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,870
If it'll make anything interesting.

2293
01:24:59,090 --> 01:24:59,830
But let's try it out.

2294
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:05,970
Slimes are already part of the world.

2295
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:06,390
Ah!

2296
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:07,730
That's what it means.

2297
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:09,390
Slimes are in by default.

2298
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,530
Oh!

2299
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,590
Oh!

2300
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:16,390
Oh!

2301
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:17,010
Oh!

2302
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:17,570
Oh!

2303
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:18,250
Oh!

2304
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:18,630
Oh!

2305
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:18,850
Oh!

2306
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:18,870
Oh!

2307
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:19,810
Whoa!

2308
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:20,450
Whoa!

2309
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,110
Why do I have a chicken?

2310
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:22,910
Egg.

2311
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:26,820
Okay.

2312
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:27,820
Got our stuff.

2313
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,960
Think I could jump from here.

2314
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:32,740
Whoa!

2315
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:33,780
Whoa!

2316
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:35,020
Oh!

2317
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:36,420
This looks...

2318
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:36,880
Wow.

2319
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:38,980
This is quite the...

2320
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:39,780
Spawn.

2321
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:41,520
Do a flip!

2322
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,280
Oh!

2323
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,220
Hey, I should have gotten that achievement.

2324
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,060
The one that says jump from a high place.

2325
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,120
Well, it's raining.

2326
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:06,730
I don't want to get ambushed, but I also want...

2327
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:07,690
Um...

2328
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:08,890
The coal.

2329
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:09,950
That's all around here.

2330
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:11,330
Okay.

2331
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,390
Lovely day for rain.

2332
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:16,810
Where are the goats?

2333
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:18,950
Whoa.

2334
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:24,140
Oh my god.

2335
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,440
That tree is getting hugged.

2336
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:26,960
By the fire...

2337
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:27,580
Or by the lava.

2338
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,320
But it's like fine.

2339
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,480
It's not on fire at all.

2340
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,040
Yes, it is.

2341
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:32,420
Nevermind.

2342
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,320
It just...

2343
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:33,920
Oh, there it goes.

2344
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,020
I thought it was the chosen one.

2345
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:40,970
Okay.

2346
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,230
How are we gonna find...

2347
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:46,390
Ourselves...

2348
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,750
An exit.

2349
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,050
Wait, though.

2350
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:52,470
We might actually be able to find some copper in this vile.

2351
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:53,370
Nope.

2352
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:55,110
Goat, bottom right.

2353
01:26:55,630 --> 01:26:56,450
Oh, shut up.

2354
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,110
She's the goat.

2355
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:03,650
Okay, let's punch some trees.

2356
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,900
I thought Craft Mine is a different game.

2357
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:14,600
You tricked me.

2358
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,880
I didn't trick you.

2359
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:17,380
Minecraft changed so much.

2360
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:17,720
No!

2361
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:20,100
What do you mean I tricked you?

2362
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,320
This is...

2363
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,020
This is...

2364
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:24,940
This is...

2365
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:25,420
Craft Mine.

2366
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:28,700
Oh yeah, we have our 24 levels.

2367
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,720
We gotta use those, huh?

2368
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,520
Upgrade Minto.

2369
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,380
What should we upgrade?

2370
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:35,900
I mean...

2371
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,980
Let me punch trees first.

2372
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,280
Oh, look at all the little foliage and everything.

2373
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:48,540
Wow.

2374
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:50,240
Detroit, thank you!

2375
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,100
I got a raise today.

2376
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:53,560
Congrats!

2377
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,420
Also hope you're doing well.

2378
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:56,300
Thank you!

2379
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:57,620
Congrats!

2380
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,480
Oh my gosh.

2381
01:27:59,180 --> 01:27:59,860
You shouldn't...

2382
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,100
Don't send it to me, though.

2383
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,280
You should've gotten something yummy.

2384
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,280
You should celebrate you!

2385
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,480
This Minecraft PGM makes me so...

2386
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,360
Emoy.

2387
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:11,280
Me too.

2388
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,180
Let's see.

2389
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,420
Compass to point...

2390
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:17,760
We could do a lodestone exit, but I probably would have to craft that, no?

2391
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,160
The first pioneers of flight weren't always successful.

2392
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,480
Maybe you can do better after unlocking the spell book.

2393
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,940
We could go faster.

2394
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:26,040
We could go faster.

2395
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,100
More pockets is nice, too.

2396
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,200
Um...

2397
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,360
Dirt enjoyer?

2398
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:40,860
Uh...

2399
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:42,220
I don't understand what these mean.

2400
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,180
They're so...

2401
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,100
They're so vague.

2402
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,320
They're so cryptic.

2403
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,320
What do you mean I appreciate the value of dirt?

2404
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,860
Dirt enjoyer is good?

2405
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:53,800
It is?

2406
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,660
Does it, like, give you more...

2407
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,340
You enjoy dirt more than others.

2408
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,240
Does it give you, like, more XP for dirt?

2409
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,640
Value 0.2.

2410
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,400
I feel like I got bullied into...

2411
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,200
Into taking this.

2412
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,540
Does it feel like it doesn't do anything?

2413
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,200
I might have been tricked.

2414
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,820
Craft mine meta.

2415
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:36,900
Maybe it's one of those, like, you have to keep unlocking it to realize its full potential.

2416
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,100
You can get campfire to...

2417
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,240
Oh, to start with!

2418
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,900
That's kind of nice.

2419
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,620
Wait, you are the campfire?

2420
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:55,710
What does that mean?

2421
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:59,070
Don't get the last one.

2422
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:00,950
Whoa!

2423
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:01,630
Team Red!

2424
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,410
I didn't get a raise.

2425
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:04,610
I just like Pinky.

2426
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:08,150
Thank you!

2427
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,870
Thank you so much!

2428
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,810
This is a...

2429
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:12,690
I forgot to mention.

2430
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:13,710
This is, like, all...

2431
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:15,790
Well, actually, maybe I did mention it, but...

2432
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:17,670
This is an April Fool's thing.

2433
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:19,990
So, would this literally just set you on fire?

2434
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:20,530
And then...

2435
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:25,030
What does that do?

2436
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,670
Wouldn't that be a good thing, though?

2437
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:36,150
It sets every block you punch on fire.

2438
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:39,550
Oh!

2439
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:41,290
Wait, that sounds kind of awesome!

2440
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:45,250
You can cook any raw food that you are holding.

2441
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:46,050
How is that bad?

2442
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,130
Wait, how is that bad thing?

2443
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:50,890
Let's keep going fast.

2444
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:55,270
Sneak as fast...

2445
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:58,090
As when you are holding both W...

2446
01:30:58,090 --> 01:30:58,750
Oh, sweet...

2447
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,610
Swiss sneaking!

2448
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,370
Speed run.

2449
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:03,450
You can't turn it off.

2450
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:04,190
Yeah?

2451
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:07,230
You are not fireproof.

2452
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:11,090
I'm still failing to see the problem.

2453
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:12,290
So...

2454
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:12,670
Oh, wait!

2455
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,270
So, if I, like, set...

2456
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:17,110
Say I set, like, a...

2457
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:19,290
A tree on...

2458
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:20,930
Like, I try to punch a tree.

2459
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:22,210
It'll just set it on fire.

2460
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,410
Like, that's the issue?

2461
01:31:27,670 --> 01:31:28,630
I'm unemployed!

2462
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:30,750
Don't send Super Chat!

2463
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:33,390
Yes.

2464
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:36,350
Oh, I can see how that would be...

2465
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:37,810
Potentially bad.

2466
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:42,050
Hello, pies.

2467
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:43,610
Come here, baby girl.

2468
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:45,130
Come here, little girl.

2469
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:47,770
Come here, little girl.

2470
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:51,270
I think she wants out of the room.

2471
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:52,550
Hold on.

2472
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:53,630
Let me go let my cat out.

2473
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,490
Also, I'm gonna put on some BGM, because the BGM...

2474
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:00,350
I always forget how inconsistent Minecraft BGM is.

2475
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:01,310
Um...

2476
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:02,190
We'll turn...

2477
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,270
Music...

2478
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:03,450
Off.

2479
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:04,450
Even though...

2480
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:06,350
I love Minecraft music, but...

2481
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:10,950
Oh...

2482
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:12,790
Music...

2483
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:14,150
Uh...

2484
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:16,570
What's this?

2485
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:17,470
What did I just press?

2486
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,310
This one?

2487
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:25,650
I want something...

2488
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:26,170
Kind of chill.

2489
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:36,620
Hold on.

2490
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,180
One second, sorry.

2491
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:42,260
There we go.

2492
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:42,760
This is good.

2493
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:48,340
Okay.

2494
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:53,670
Okay, give me a second.

2495
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:54,530
I'm gonna let my cat out.

2496
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,360
Okay.

2497
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:32,300
Okie dokie.

2498
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:38,600
Uh...

2499
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,300
This is...

2500
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,920
This is Andesite, no?

2501
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,200
I get paid by Meta.

2502
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,280
Oh...

2503
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:49,620
Oh no!

2504
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,340
I need a thing!

2505
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,420
Ow!

2506
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:52,160
I forgot!

2507
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,480
What do you mean you get paid by Meta?

2508
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:58,280
I'm also unemployed.

2509
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:58,820
Stop!

2510
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,640
Miss Phantom, are you hiring?

2511
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:02,700
Oh...

2512
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:03,620
Oh golly.

2513
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,840
What are your...

2514
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,020
Credentials?

2515
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,400
I need regular stone!

2516
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,760
But everything's...

2517
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,140
Not regular stone!

2518
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,440
No!

2519
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,520
I need stone!

2520
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,880
Boy, this is bad.

2521
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,160
Wait, we can make it with...

2522
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:24,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

2523
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:25,160
I'm stupid.

2524
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,360
I'm stupid.

2525
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,460
We can make it with...

2526
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:29,180
With wood.

2527
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,020
There, I'll make it out of this.

2528
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:34,200
There we go.

2529
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:34,780
Okay, okay.

2530
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:35,680
You.

2531
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:36,780
Alright, alright, alright.

2532
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,720
Dig straight down.

2533
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,720
I wonder what would happen.

2534
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:43,140
In a world like this, if we dug straight down?

2535
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:44,860
What would happen?

2536
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:46,800
Unemployed gang.

2537
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,380
I don't think you guys should be sending me money if you are unemployed.

2538
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:51,800
That's just...

2539
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,220
Uh...

2540
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:53,120
I'm not a professional.

2541
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:54,420
But that's like my...

2542
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:55,540
Professional opinion.

2543
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,040
I came really close to getting fired this morning!

2544
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:05,860
Are you guys okay?

2545
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,580
Last two dollars.

2546
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:08,180
Please stop.

2547
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:10,420
Always forget to use this.

2548
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:10,960
Oh!

2549
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:11,680
Thank you!

2550
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:12,780
Thanks for six months.

2551
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:14,420
Okay.

2552
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:17,880
Now...

2553
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,960
We're good.

2554
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:19,820
Now we're cooking.

2555
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:20,380
Okay.

2556
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,180
Ever since we were able to get the crafting table.

2557
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:23,820
Now we...

2558
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:24,840
Now we're cooking, baby.

2559
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:30,850
I'm retired.

2560
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,130
Are you like one of those like...

2561
01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:34,810
Like 1% of people?

2562
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:36,010
Less than.

2563
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:37,070
Less than what?

2564
01:35:37,150 --> 01:35:38,690
I get like sometimes like the...

2565
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:43,250
0.01% that is like...

2566
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:46,090
You know when you look at the analytics and it says like...

2567
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:48,510
Old people watching you.

2568
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:49,650
You know?

2569
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:50,070
Well...

2570
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,540
My boss is cutting my house.

2571
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,640
My credentials is loving me too.

2572
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:01,680
Do I get the job?

2573
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:05,780
I will.

2574
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,840
You can clean the tables at the maid cafe.

2575
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:08,540
If you like.

2576
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:11,380
Okay.

2577
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,280
Let's make a sword.

2578
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:14,800
Very nice.

2579
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:17,920
Starting to get dark.

2580
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:18,640
Scary.

2581
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,040
Spooky.

2582
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:21,220
Wait.

2583
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,060
We're getting slimes and creepers.

2584
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:23,320
Snow.

2585
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:24,900
This is going to be weird.

2586
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,280
Thank you guys.

2587
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:30,920
For all this everything.

2588
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:31,500
Thank you.

2589
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,980
I want $500 and a March Madness.

2590
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:35,520
What?

2591
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:36,520
That's crazy.

2592
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:37,460
Oh my God.

2593
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:38,000
Thank you guys.

2594
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:38,820
Thank you.

2595
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,220
Oh my God.

2596
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:47,040
Money of someone who got a new job.

2597
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:48,300
Congratulations.

2598
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,220
On your new job.

2599
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:52,940
I think...

2600
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,500
I think...

2601
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,300
I think if you get a new job.

2602
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,680
You should like...

2603
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:57,380
You should...

2604
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:58,240
Like...

2605
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,740
Get something for yourself.

2606
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:00,820
And...

2607
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:01,620
For...

2608
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,140
As a...

2609
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,300
As a happy...

2610
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,300
Happy day to you.

2611
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:05,800
Look at the...

2612
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:08,280
I've never seen a baby goat before.

2613
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:09,540
Wait.

2614
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,100
Oh sorry.

2615
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:11,960
I didn't hit him right?

2616
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:12,400
No.

2617
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:12,980
He's fine.

2618
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,940
He's so cute.

2619
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,640
I've never seen a baby goat.

2620
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:15,840
Here.

2621
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:16,140
Watch...

2622
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:16,960
Watch me murder baby.

2623
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,180
This is the real world.

2624
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:20,800
That's the real world.

2625
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:21,080
Oh.

2626
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:21,920
Where'd he go?

2627
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,280
Wait.

2628
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,200
Where'd the baby goat go?

2629
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,260
I didn't kill him on a...

2630
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:26,400
Wait.

2631
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,760
Was that the baby goat that I just killed?

2632
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:28,780
No.

2633
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:29,280
Wait.

2634
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,000
What did I just kill?

2635
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:31,060
I killed a duck.

2636
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:31,880
What?

2637
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:32,560
Wait.

2638
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,320
Where'd the baby goat...

2639
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:33,800
Oh there he is.

2640
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,180
He's fine.

2641
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:38,320
Look how cute he is.

2642
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,040
Oh my God.

2643
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,180
He's so stinking cute.

2644
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:40,280
Cool.

2645
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:46,970
Okay.

2646
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:49,450
Alright.

2647
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:51,570
I wish the rain would stop.

2648
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:52,990
Here's the cut of my paycheck.

2649
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,050
Thank you, guys!

2650
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,670
Thank you.

2651
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:01,970
Still trying to find a new job.

2652
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:02,890
You got this!

2653
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,470
You got this, 9-0!

2654
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:07,430
You got this, I believe.

2655
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:08,650
Let's make a boat.

2656
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:10,090
Let's make a boat.

2657
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,690
See, I told you, I don't know anything.

2658
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,530
What the?

2659
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:20,850
Where'd my boat go?

2660
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:23,570
It goes minted.

2661
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:25,450
Oh!

2662
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,090
Eh, ah, eh, ah, eh, ah.

2663
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:29,790
There we go.

2664
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:38,940
Minted.

2665
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:47,320
It's the one thing about having mint as a... One terrible thing, I suppose, about having mint as a name is...

2666
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,920
Everything is like a crypto... Ooh!

2667
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,640
Things are minted!

2668
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,820
I don't even know what that means.

2669
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,880
I'm just... That's what... I'm minto!

2670
01:38:58,340 --> 01:38:59,220
Not minted!

2671
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,680
I can't see anything.

2672
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,620
I want to turn my brightness up.

2673
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,920
I can't see a single thing.

2674
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,060
I don't think that's it.

2675
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,060
Oh, that was so close!

2676
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,840
Still the... No!

2677
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:25,860
Don't steal money!

2678
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,000
I mean...

2679
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,720
Unless...

2680
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:33,540
Oh, there's a creeper.

2681
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,980
Okay, that's our first creeper.

2682
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,760
Are creepers afraid of the rain?

2683
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:37,540
No.

2684
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:46,540
Goat goes minted.

2685
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:50,200
Mint goes boated?

2686
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,860
Mint is...

2687
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,600
Mint is...

2688
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,240
Boated?

2689
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:54,860
Goated?

2690
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,240
Alright.

2691
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,600
We're just traveling along this little river.

2692
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,700
May it never end.

2693
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,540
May us only find...

2694
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:07,340
A...

2695
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:10,300
Exit through this means of...

2696
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:11,240
Method of travel.

2697
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,020
Fade goes minted.

2698
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,200
Dipping into the 401k!

2699
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,240
Stop!

2700
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:19,400
Please!

2701
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:25,040
Don't do it for VTubers.

2702
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,890
It's not worth it, I promise.

2703
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:30,930
It's not worth it.

2704
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:33,270
Wow, we're really on like the ocean blue here.

2705
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:35,870
I still don't see any...

2706
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:37,010
Oh!

2707
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:37,730
Oh!

2708
01:40:37,730 --> 01:40:38,450
Thank goodness.

2709
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:39,750
Oh, finally.

2710
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:41,370
Oh my goodness.

2711
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:41,810
Oh!

2712
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:42,210
Oh!

2713
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:43,030
Oh!

2714
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:44,570
I see it!

2715
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:46,810
It's another underwater one.

2716
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:51,090
Wait, I have like nothing here though.

2717
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,540
I have like no supplies.

2718
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,840
I'm working right now.

2719
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,340
My cut of the paycheck.

2720
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,800
Tipping into my retirement fund.

2721
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:06,540
Dirt?

2722
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,580
Get lots of dirt?

2723
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,020
Okay, let's get dirt, baby.

2724
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:10,820
Let's get dirty.

2725
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:15,140
Sorry.

2726
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:17,380
Sorry.

2727
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,020
Glad I'm able to send my very first super jet.

2728
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:21,760
Stop!

2729
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:22,500
Shut up!

2730
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,000
Don't lie.

2731
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,020
Okay, creepers, I need you to go away.

2732
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:28,520
So I can...

2733
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,160
Um...

2734
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,240
Excavate your land.

2735
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:36,350
Wow, this one was so fast.

2736
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:38,950
We're so good.

2737
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:40,810
Wait, let's get a bunch of flowers maybe.

2738
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,480
Instructions unclear.

2739
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:48,000
No.

2740
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:52,000
It's worth it to see your smile.

2741
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:53,520
Or your cries of anguish.

2742
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:56,020
There's no tags.

2743
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,800
I think it's okay if I use my company credit card.

2744
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,180
Can you invoice me?

2745
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,300
Oh no.

2746
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:04,020
Um...

2747
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:04,480
Yeah, maybe.

2748
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,700
Guys, try and remember...

2749
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,340
Oh!

2750
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:07,900
Wait!

2751
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,360
Cherry Blossom!

2752
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:09,980
Wait!

2753
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:11,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2754
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:12,380
Whoa!

2755
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:13,680
Cherry Blossom!

2756
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:15,420
Try...

2757
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:16,840
Remember, it's over there.

2758
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:17,140
Okay?

2759
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,200
Cherry Blossom.

2760
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,500
Maybe we can get something special here.

2761
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,500
And there's a creeper.

2762
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:30,740
Hmm...

2763
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:31,800
Hmm...

2764
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,720
I have a...

2765
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:34,620
I have a stone sword.

2766
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:38,760
Oh my gosh, thank you guys!

2767
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:41,960
Chat GPS.

2768
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:45,080
Is this the ATM?

2769
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:47,960
No, no, no!

2770
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:48,780
Don't do it.

2771
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:49,680
Don't do it.

2772
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:50,920
Don't do it!

2773
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,180
Don't do it!

2774
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:53,360
Don't do it!

2775
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,280
Don't do it!

2776
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,100
Don't please!

2777
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:57,600
Stop!

2778
01:42:58,160 --> 01:42:59,400
Stop coming towards me!

2779
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,620
Don't do it!

2780
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,760
Oh my god, you're so obsessed with me.

2781
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:09,860
Wait...

2782
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,560
Where's the slimes?

2783
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:13,100
Or...

2784
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:13,480
Oh wait!

2785
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,740
No, yeah, where are the slimes?

2786
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,940
Where are the slimes at?

2787
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,200
Also, what's all this over here?

2788
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:20,600
There's all the stuff that's lit up.

2789
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:25,340
What is that?

2790
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,060
Oh, it's the little...

2791
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:29,660
This thingy.

2792
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:31,320
This stuff.

2793
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,600
Okay.

2794
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:40,370
Okay.

2795
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:40,890
Aw man...

2796
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:42,270
Creeper.

2797
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:44,070
I really wanna get to this...

2798
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,930
tree here.

2799
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:48,190
If you could like...

2800
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:49,210
give me some...

2801
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:49,690
space.

2802
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:52,190
I'm...

2803
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:53,990
asserting my boundaries.

2804
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,160
This is my first ever...

2805
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:01,180
This is my first ever...

2806
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:01,700
Akasupa.

2807
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,080
Danny.

2808
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,840
Thank you so much!

2809
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,500
Became my copy O.C.

2810
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,300
Thank you!

2811
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,720
As I slowly back up from this guy.

2812
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:19,740
LOL, this is my financial advisor.

2813
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:20,260
No!

2814
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,240
I'm gonna be a creeper because I'm real obsessed with me too.

2815
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,740
Thank you, Marley!

2816
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,000
Okay.

2817
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:30,680
Boat jousting?

2818
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,440
Oh, so true!

2819
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,180
Alright, here we go.

2820
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,040
And...

2821
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:34,240
Brap!

2822
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:39,880
I lived.

2823
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,220
Where'd my boat go?

2824
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:42,940
There it is!

2825
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:44,040
Oh, there it goes.

2826
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:50,090
And the sun's coming up!

2827
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:50,570
I think.

2828
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:53,650
We made it through the night!

2829
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:58,070
We made it at our goal!

2830
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:00,890
It's okay.

2831
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:02,010
I have...

2832
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:02,690
raw chicken.

2833
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:05,490
That won't poison me.

2834
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:06,970
Oops!

2835
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:13,870
Super Chat doesn't like the office wifi.

2836
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:14,190
What?

2837
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:14,730
That's so bizarre.

2838
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,370
I think that's a good reason not to Super Chat then.

2839
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:19,590
I'd say.

2840
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:21,710
Maybe.

2841
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:22,950
Don't do it then.

2842
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:28,350
Okay, hold on.

2843
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:29,330
Alright, guys.

2844
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,030
Let's get some cherry blossom trees.

2845
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:32,750
For our worlds!

2846
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:33,710
Please!

2847
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:35,250
Please!

2848
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:43,530
Please!

2849
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,160
Come on!

2850
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:53,020
Something dropped!

2851
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:53,820
Drop the goods!

2852
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:54,480
Drop the goods!

2853
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,360
This is a stick up.

2854
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,560
This is a hold up.

2855
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:57,760
Drop the goods.

2856
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,440
Drop the goods.

2857
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:02,240
Give me everything.

2858
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:03,580
That you own.

2859
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,520
Back in the US after three months.

2860
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:07,380
In Japan!

2861
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,500
Three months!

2862
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,300
Have some depression dollars.

2863
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,900
Three months is...

2864
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,620
Wait, what's this?

2865
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:16,680
Wait.

2866
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,100
Dark forest bio!

2867
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:22,720
Okay.

2868
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,400
Well, at least we got a new ingredient.

2869
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,720
That's kind of the goal of this.

2870
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:28,500
Is to keep collecting new ingredients.

2871
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:34,280
Wi-Fi test.

2872
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:35,900
Oh my gosh.

2873
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:36,880
I'm Java hunting.

2874
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:39,680
Can you fire that other one wisp and hire me?

2875
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:43,660
Oh, that guy is like doing the best job we've ever had though.

2876
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,740
He's my best man.

2877
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:48,800
Oh!

2878
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:49,740
Oh, sniffer!

2879
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,600
Sniffer, sniffer!

2880
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:53,720
Sniffer, sniffer.

2881
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:55,220
Okay.

2882
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:56,580
That's two new ones.

2883
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:57,620
Two new ingredients.

2884
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:58,880
Very cool.

2885
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,940
And also, we need to get some dirt.

2886
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,020
We need to get dirt.

2887
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,760
Don't worry about my financial state.

2888
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:09,800
Okay.

2889
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,600
I do worry.

2890
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:14,220
I do worry about you guys sometimes.

2891
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:24,960
I need the...

2892
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,100
Oh!

2893
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:25,780
Another sniffer.

2894
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:26,760
Wait, what's this?

2895
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:27,400
Oh!

2896
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,640
A third sniffer?

2897
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:30,420
Four!

2898
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:35,090
Guys, I don't think we're getting cherry blossom.

2899
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:39,950
Oh my god!

2900
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:42,990
Six of them!

2901
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:47,570
Aw.

2902
01:47:48,730 --> 01:47:50,630
Wait, I wonder if we can also get...

2903
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,170
Sand.

2904
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:55,210
Did I just get another one?

2905
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:56,290
Oh my god!

2906
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:00,530
Let's dig up some sand too.

2907
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:04,110
Let's just try and get all different new types of...

2908
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:06,590
You know...

2909
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:07,230
Material.

2910
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,010
Oh.

2911
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:11,590
I've hit the...

2912
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:12,130
I've hit the...

2913
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:12,590
I've hit the...

2914
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:13,470
I've hit the rock.

2915
01:48:15,570 --> 01:48:16,250
Just kidding.

2916
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:20,420
Okay.

2917
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,760
Cherry blossom.

2918
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:23,480
Sniffa.

2919
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:26,240
Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff.

2920
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:28,980
I think the game is trying to tell me something.

2921
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:33,820
Poopy!

2922
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:35,960
Welcome back for 12 months, thank you.

2923
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,280
Oh...

2924
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,400
Okay, that's another dark forest, yeah.

2925
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,920
Let's throw out...

2926
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:51,940
This...

2927
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,840
This...

2928
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:55,840
And...

2929
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:57,980
This...

2930
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,560
Why is there a bat here?

2931
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:04,780
Also, where is all this dirt coming from?

2932
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,540
I'm giving...

2933
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:08,960
Minto money, yippee!

2934
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,780
Yip, yippee!

2935
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,580
Yip, yippee!

2936
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,140
Heck yeah!

2937
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:28,040
Why is there just...

2938
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:29,460
There's dirt over there too?

2939
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:31,740
Huh?

2940
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,500
Why is there dirt over here?

2941
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,150
Am I like...

2942
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,060
Dropping...

2943
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:39,600
Dirt?

2944
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:41,840
Am I like...

2945
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,780
Producing my own blocks of dirt?

2946
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:48,340
What?

2947
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:49,820
Follow the dirt?

2948
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:54,500
Huh?

2949
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,590
Is there still...

2950
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:59,300
There might still be...

2951
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,820
What's it called in there?

2952
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:03,320
Yep.

2953
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,840
I knew it.

2954
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,500
Yep.

2955
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:11,210
You are Pigpen from Peanuts.

2956
01:50:14,150 --> 01:50:15,310
I'm disgusting!

2957
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:20,210
How do I get more...

2958
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:22,410
If I throw something out, do I produce dirt?

2959
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:26,510
Turn into dirt.

2960
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:30,110
Where does the dirt come from?

2961
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:31,990
It's so mysterious...

2962
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:33,030
Wait, there's dirt over there!

2963
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:36,260
It's so mysterious...

2964
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:39,030
The dirt is mysterious and important...

2965
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:42,400
Okay, well...

2966
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:43,220
I...

2967
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:44,290
What?

2968
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:46,090
It's like...

2969
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:47,930
It's like...

2970
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:51,400
It's like...

2971
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:52,340
Welcome to membership!

2972
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:53,080
Thank you!

2973
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:59,280
Finally rematerialize to celebrate a year of my Kamiyoshi!

2974
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:00,040
Thank you!

2975
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:07,200
Here's to another year of watching her so she can't flirt with my fiancee behind my back.

2976
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,080
It would never stab me...

2977
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:12,780
Oh my god!

2978
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:14,240
How many Sniffers do we have?

2979
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:16,780
Thirteen!

2980
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:19,340
Where are these bats coming from?

2981
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,880
This is so...

2982
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:22,560
What is this?

2983
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:23,580
Why is there...

2984
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:25,800
Wait, are the bats bringing the dirt?

2985
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:27,360
I...

2986
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:27,680
I...

2987
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,180
This is so strange!

2988
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:33,640
This is so strange!

2989
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:45,470
Dirt maxing...

2990
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:47,750
They weren't kidding when they said we really like the dirt.

2991
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:49,850
There's more dirt than more Sniffers!

2992
01:51:50,090 --> 01:51:52,850
The Sniffers, I've imagined, are not gonna give us like...

2993
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:54,110
Any experience...

2994
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:54,890
Another one!

2995
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:00,920
Where is the dirt coming from?

2996
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,780
Sorry, I know it's...

2997
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:05,200
It's just...

2998
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,080
It's just strange.

2999
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,020
That's why I'm so confused by it.

3000
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,540
But it gives us more points, so I'll take it.

3001
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,380
Only found you everyday fuel.

3002
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:21,520
Thank you!

3003
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:22,900
That's all good!

3004
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:27,560
Tasty?

3005
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,140
The dirt?

3006
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:30,500
We could...

3007
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:31,200
We could...

3008
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,180
Literally...

3009
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:32,440
There's...

3010
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:32,820
What?

3011
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,020
Where did that come from?

3012
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:34,560
No.

3013
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,880
No, I saw it literally just spawn.

3014
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:48,580
Okay, alright.

3015
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,760
I think we're good to get out of here.

3016
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,960
I think we're probably fine to get...

3017
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:53,560
There's more.

3018
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:55,060
Where did you come from?

3019
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,100
Okay, I'm watching the bats.

3020
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:15,240
I don't know.

3021
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,580
I don't know anymore.

3022
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:28,660
I enjoyed watching and vibing with you and everyone...

3023
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:29,020
Thank you!

3024
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,440
Where did it come from?

3025
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:31,880
I don't know!

3026
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,280
Ah!

3027
01:53:33,660 --> 01:53:34,280
Scary!

3028
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,320
It's so freaky!

3029
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,100
I don't get it!

3030
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,000
There's dirt over here!

3031
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:48,760
There's dirt over here!

3032
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,300
I guess we'll just fill up our inventory with stuff and...

3033
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:54,440
Take it over.

3034
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,260
I've...

3035
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,620
I'm freaking out right now, you guys.

3036
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,640
I'm freaking out!

3037
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:00,320
I'm freaking out a little bit!

3038
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,660
I think the dirt comes from the skill you took.

3039
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:04,260
Yeah, but I don't understand...

3040
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:05,960
I don't understand why.

3041
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:07,760
Why?

3042
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:11,240
Does this give me a very little value?

3043
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,220
You offer nothing to me, crafting table.

3044
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:14,680
Okay.

3045
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:17,200
Okay.

3046
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:20,220
Get two things...

3047
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:21,940
Someone said get two stacks of dirt.

3048
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,360
What, will it be a ton of XP?

3049
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,960
We can go somewhere and just dig.

3050
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:31,020
Let's go back towards where the...

3051
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,000
Beacon was.

3052
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,960
Unfortunately, we did not get any cherry blossom...

3053
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,280
Thingies, but...

3054
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,900
I also wanna see if maybe the...

3055
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,940
I was gonna check out the flowers, too.

3056
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,040
If that unlocks anything, because...

3057
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:48,540
Um...

3058
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:50,600
Yeah.

3059
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,800
Well, we have unlocked some new stuff, at least.

3060
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:55,080
Oh, and I can get chicken.

3061
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,320
Good, because I need to eat.

3062
01:54:59,000 --> 01:54:59,600
Come here.

3063
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:00,620
Come here.

3064
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:03,300
Yep, thank you.

3065
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,280
What the?

3066
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:07,120
Thank you.

3067
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:13,140
Like, please, please, come here.

3068
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:13,680
Thank you.

3069
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,720
Oh, the dirt!

3070
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,260
Where did it come from?

3071
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,120
Thank you.

3072
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:28,540
Oh, Sniffa.

3073
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:29,780
Oh, Sniffa.

3074
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,220
Okay, I think breaking the flowers gives you more Sniffa.

3075
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:35,140
Which we totally...

3076
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:37,420
Totally need any more of these.

3077
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:45,890
Oh, my chat is frozen.

3078
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:46,810
One moment, please.

3079
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:50,330
8 for 5.

3080
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,360
Sniffa plus dirt is a freaky combo.

3081
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,360
Freaky.

3082
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,380
Thanks for thawing us.

3083
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:09,960
You're welcome.

3084
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:12,780
Okay.

3085
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:14,460
Alright, dirt.

3086
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,580
Let's grab some dirt.

3087
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:19,960
I left my crafting table, because I'm a bozo head.

3088
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,820
Guys, what's the...

3089
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:27,060
What do I need to make a shovel?

3090
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,280
What's...

3091
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:33,540
The shovel?

3092
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,040
Oh!

3093
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,080
I'm a genius.

3094
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:38,880
Never mind.

3095
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:40,260
I'm too smart.

3096
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:41,620
I'm too...

3097
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,500
I'm too smart at this.

3098
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,580
Just one block.

3099
01:56:56,180 --> 01:56:57,980
Getting lots and lots of dirt here.

3100
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:01,240
Hopefully nothing spawns.

3101
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:01,780
We'll be...

3102
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:02,980
We're close to our...

3103
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:05,620
We're close to the...

3104
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:06,160
Boat.

3105
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:06,900
It should be fine.

3106
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:08,800
Oh, let's get rid of a flower.

3107
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:09,400
There we go.

3108
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:11,500
Pick up all my dirt.

3109
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:12,580
Very important.

3110
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:13,660
The reason we're here.

3111
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:19,180
You should eat.

3112
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,240
Yeah, you're right.

3113
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,560
But I don't know the recipe.

3114
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,220
You know what?

3115
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:27,260
Risk it for the biscuit.

3116
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:42,650
We're almost done anyway.

3117
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:49,660
Eat the dirt.

3118
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:52,680
Do the flowers give us any...

3119
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:53,440
Oh, a point three.

3120
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,820
I guess anything is good.

3121
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:58,240
Maybe.

3122
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,060
And that's two stacks.

3123
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,120
Do I...

3124
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:04,120
Does this give me anything?

3125
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:09,440
Okay.

3126
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:10,640
Let's go.

3127
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:14,000
Hello.

3128
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:14,420
Hello.

3129
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:14,820
Hello.

3130
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:16,620
Hello.

3131
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:17,160
Hello.

3132
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:17,980
Hello.

3133
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:21,760
See, we're fine.

3134
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:24,460
Everything's all good.

3135
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:25,940
Just keep...

3136
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:27,520
Keep eating raw chicken.

3137
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:29,220
You'll eventually recover.

3138
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,740
Our stomach is strong.

3139
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:34,960
It's mighty.

3140
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,360
Here's more meatlobugs for...

3141
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,460
The mine that you crafted...

3142
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,020
That you...

3143
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:43,740
Oh, thank you!

3144
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,080
What if I...

3145
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,360
What if I took...

3146
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:49,160
Materials from...

3147
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:49,980
The portal?

3148
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:51,500
I wonder if I can do that.

3149
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,000
Wow!

3150
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:08,900
Woohoo!

3151
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:09,780
31!

3152
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,740
Let's go.

3153
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:16,160
I think I got all of it.

3154
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:17,900
Very nice.

3155
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:20,260
Mine three.

3156
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,700
Oh, we didn't get any trophies this time.

3157
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:25,540
It's kind of sad.

3158
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,580
One whole year of my coffee...

3159
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:28,740
Oh, see!

3160
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:29,780
Take your boost!

3161
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:32,940
Thank you!

3162
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:36,100
Mine four...

3163
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:36,720
Base.

3164
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,360
Oh, okay.

3165
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,840
We got frogs and skellies.

3166
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:39,640
Oh, no.

3167
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:40,520
We got skellies.

3168
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:42,440
Okay.

3169
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:45,800
Um...

3170
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,100
What do we wanna do?

3171
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:51,520
I'll be going to an anime con in my city this weekend.

3172
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:53,280
Fahana will be performing!

3173
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:54,880
Lots of indie VTubers.

3174
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:55,280
Woah!

3175
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:57,300
I'll be repping you by wearing my Minto Happy.

3176
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,580
Have fun, Verily!

3177
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:00,300
Oh my gosh, Fahana is so fun to see.

3178
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:04,200
Let's get some Sniffers!

3179
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:06,600
We got so many of them, so...

3180
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:08,500
Employed gang here.

3181
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:09,820
Solid snake!

3182
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,380
No way, you?

3183
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:13,040
The legend is employed?

3184
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,980
Wait, what do you mean you had an awful morning?

3185
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:18,380
No!

3186
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:19,760
No!

3187
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:22,600
I hope...

3188
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,680
I hope you're okay.

3189
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:26,680
We could...

3190
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:30,380
It says base rock is deep slate, but maybe we should do...

3191
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:33,000
Uh...

3192
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,400
Maybe we should do...

3193
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:34,980
Oh, jungle!

3194
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,600
Wait, I want a jungle biome.

3195
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:39,840
Wait...

3196
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:40,700
Or...

3197
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:43,260
Wait, I think a dark forest would be so bad with skellies.

3198
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:43,920
Let's try the jungle.

3199
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,500
The hero of Shadow Moses?

3200
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:03,990
Let's see...

3201
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:05,110
What's some new stuff?

3202
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,570
Win a special encounter mod.

3203
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,550
We haven't gotten that.

3204
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:11,430
Collect mushrooms and you might get lucky.

3205
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:12,350
Oh, okay!

3206
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,070
A mushroom field biome!

3207
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:15,450
That would be great!

3208
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:16,610
Because we would have no...

3209
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:17,630
No mobs!

3210
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:18,910
No bad mobs!

3211
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:21,770
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3212
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:23,990
Dry land.

3213
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:26,490
Don't...

3214
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:28,510
Try to get even warmer in the badlands.

3215
02:01:28,650 --> 02:01:29,870
What, set myself on fire?

3216
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:31,670
Or...

3217
02:01:31,670 --> 02:01:32,670
One year!

3218
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:33,650
Thank you, Cap'n!

3219
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:34,730
Cap...

3220
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:35,130
Cap...

3221
02:01:35,130 --> 02:01:35,570
Cap'n!

3222
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:39,690
Okay.

3223
02:01:40,990 --> 02:01:41,870
One HP.

3224
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:43,730
Kill something while having only one heart.

3225
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:45,730
Oh, I totally could have gotten that.

3226
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:48,960
Snowy search code blocks.

3227
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:49,610
Okay.

3228
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:50,970
Bouncy blocks.

3229
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:52,010
Find and kill some slimes.

3230
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:53,530
Wait!

3231
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:55,250
Then give me slime!

3232
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:58,770
I want to find and kill the slime.

3233
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:01,130
I didn't find any slime though.

3234
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:03,110
Hmm.

3235
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:06,830
Hmm.

3236
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:06,930
Hmm.

3237
02:02:09,190 --> 02:02:10,290
We'll do that one next.

3238
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:11,650
We'll get some slimes.

3239
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:12,990
You have a slime egg.

3240
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:13,330
Yeah.

3241
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:14,450
But I...

3242
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:16,090
They didn't appear last time.

3243
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:18,430
They didn't appear...

3244
02:02:18,430 --> 02:02:21,670
There were supposed to be slimes in the last one we just did.

3245
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:22,550
And we didn't get any.

3246
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:23,870
Two!

3247
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:24,830
One!

3248
02:02:25,530 --> 02:02:25,950
Bye-bye!

3249
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:26,450
And...

3250
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:27,650
Absolutely placing...

3251
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:29,050
Whoa.

3252
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:30,390
Ooh!

3253
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:31,990
Oh my god!

3254
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:33,070
Oh, get...

3255
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:34,290
Get out of the water!

3256
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:37,870
Why'd they put me in this tree?

3257
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,040
Why do we start with an egg?

3258
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:46,660
Oh!

3259
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:47,140
Hello.

3260
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,520
Why are you not upgrading?

3261
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:54,380
Cause I forget.

3262
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:56,700
Here, once I get out of this tree, I'll upgrade.

3263
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,780
But also, I kinda wanted to get the fire upgrade.

3264
02:03:02,140 --> 02:03:03,480
But I guess I shouldn't.

3265
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:08,100
My emergency chicken.

3266
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:10,660
Okay.

3267
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:12,180
Let's upgrade.

3268
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:13,820
Let's see.

3269
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:14,800
What do we want?

3270
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:16,520
When do we want it?

3271
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,520
What do we want?

3272
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:19,480
Amphibian!

3273
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:21,040
Oh, fast as the fish?

3274
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:21,820
Wait.

3275
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,760
That sounds pretty good actually.

3276
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:25,760
Like...

3277
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,200
Plus one jump.

3278
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:31,440
Get more experience after each mine.

3279
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,500
Load stone.

3280
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:36,200
Double jump seems pretty good, no?

3281
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:37,940
Ooh!

3282
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:38,700
Whoa!

3283
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:39,880
Even more jump.

3284
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:41,820
More and more jump.

3285
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:42,660
Isn't that a...

3286
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:44,060
Isn't that a...

3287
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:45,400
Project Sekai group?

3288
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:47,440
Wait.

3289
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:48,340
What is it like now?

3290
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:51,700
Oh my god!

3291
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:53,220
Oh my god!

3292
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:53,280
Oh my god!

3293
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:59,250
Wow!

3294
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:01,530
Wow!

3295
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:03,070
Wow!

3296
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:04,110
Wow!

3297
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:09,010
More more jump!

3298
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:13,050
The Lakers need you.

3299
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:14,150
Get out of the mines!

3300
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:16,790
I can't...

3301
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:18,070
This is where I belong.

3302
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:19,590
Need for speed.

3303
02:04:19,590 --> 02:04:22,510
Swift sneaking is pretty nice too, but...

3304
02:04:22,510 --> 02:04:24,510
I don't think we need it right now.

3305
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:26,530
We'll...

3306
02:04:26,530 --> 02:04:27,570
Get more experience.

3307
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:31,950
If you go down the lodestone path, you start with a compass.

3308
02:04:32,530 --> 02:04:34,550
Okay, I gotta get more experience then.

3309
02:04:37,470 --> 02:04:39,650
But with a compass to lead to the...

3310
02:04:39,650 --> 02:04:40,930
To the exit, right?

3311
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:45,040
Alright.

3312
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:46,420
I...

3313
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:47,620
Oops.

3314
02:04:47,780 --> 02:04:48,560
I missed it.

3315
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,060
This is so crazy.

3316
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:54,760
Having...

3317
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:56,020
Having...

3318
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:56,680
Double jump...

3319
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,740
In Minecraft.

3320
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:58,760
Okay.

3321
02:04:59,320 --> 02:04:59,720
Alright.

3322
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,240
Sorry.

3323
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:01,780
I'm getting a little lost in the sauce.

3324
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:02,240
Let's...

3325
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:02,900
Let's build a boat.

3326
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,980
That's not what I meant to do.

3327
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:06,780
At all.

3328
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:07,260
There we go.

3329
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:09,580
There we go.

3330
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:09,860
Okay.

3331
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:10,900
And...

3332
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:12,100
We need a crafting table.

3333
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:13,440
This game...

3334
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:13,660
This...

3335
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:14,320
This game...

3336
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:15,580
This version of Minecraft...

3337
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:15,900
Oh, sorry.

3338
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,820
Craft mine is going to force me to learn how these...

3339
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:20,080
Recipes are.

3340
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:21,800
You know?

3341
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:32,350
Just...

3342
02:05:32,350 --> 02:05:33,290
Just grab that for now.

3343
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:35,570
Hello, Mint.

3344
02:05:35,630 --> 02:05:36,030
Hello!

3345
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:40,290
What are all these sniffers doing about?

3346
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:43,970
I don't remember what the...

3347
02:05:43,970 --> 02:05:45,530
Oh, the sniffers give you eggs, right?

3348
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,210
Hello, big boy.

3349
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,070
Copper!

3350
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:52,170
Wait!

3351
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:53,310
Wait!

3352
02:05:53,610 --> 02:05:54,150
Oh my god.

3353
02:05:54,790 --> 02:05:55,070
Wait!

3354
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:57,750
It's just one, but...

3355
02:05:58,470 --> 02:06:00,330
It's just one, but that's big.

3356
02:06:01,570 --> 02:06:02,270
Hold on.

3357
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:03,070
Let's get some stone.

3358
02:06:06,540 --> 02:06:09,420
Because the copper can create the eye...

3359
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,420
Of exit.

3360
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:13,360
Where's the boat going?

3361
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,420
I think you know.

3362
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:28,380
Yeah, big ol' sniff.

3363
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:30,700
I like how they're just all floating.

3364
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:33,100
Why are they all floating in the water?

3365
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:36,040
Actually, just a lurker behind me though.

3366
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,280
Thank you for saying hi!

3367
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:38,800
Hello!

3368
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,320
Hello, Div.

3369
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:42,580
Thank you for the super tattoo.

3370
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:42,800
Two.

3371
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:44,440
Oh.

3372
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:46,100
Oh?

3373
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:47,580
Wait.

3374
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:54,320
Where'd all my stick go?

3375
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:56,160
Oh, it's because I created two of these.

3376
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:56,360
Okay.

3377
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:56,920
Alright.

3378
02:06:58,080 --> 02:06:58,320
Alright.

3379
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:00,760
Throw you...

3380
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:01,020
Oh.

3381
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:01,960
It's fine.

3382
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:02,880
I'll throw it away later.

3383
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:05,020
Two!

3384
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:07,040
Okay, we needed...

3385
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,040
It was quite a bit, but that's not bad.

3386
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:10,240
Two...

3387
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:11,040
Two is good.

3388
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,240
What was it?

3389
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,860
I don't remember what the recipe was.

3390
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,980
Eye of exit.

3391
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:19,840
Iron.

3392
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:20,360
Okay.

3393
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:25,660
Get a furnace too?

3394
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:26,340
So true!

3395
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:27,220
So true.

3396
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:30,520
Yeah, I'm just gonna use up my wood one.

3397
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:33,680
I spent the materials on it.

3398
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,980
I don't like wasting things, you know?

3399
02:07:37,820 --> 02:07:38,960
It's a waste.

3400
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:43,780
Eight copper.

3401
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:46,000
One iron for eye.

3402
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:46,720
Thank you, Blaze.

3403
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:47,320
Thank you.

3404
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,020
Thank you guys for doing the math for me.

3405
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:52,500
Oh, sorry.

3406
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:53,720
I thought I saw...

3407
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:55,620
I thought I saw some...

3408
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:56,220
Uh...

3409
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:56,680
Coal.

3410
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,480
But it's those little deep slates in there.

3411
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:02,640
Are you gonna dig anything for us, Mr. Sniffer?

3412
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,160
No?

3413
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:05,620
Okay.

3414
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:05,680
Okay.

3415
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:07,620
Let's go search for...

3416
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,420
Iron and...

3417
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:12,980
Why are they all in the water?

3418
02:08:16,430 --> 02:08:18,680
Did not a single one spawn on land?

3419
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:22,640
Okay.

3420
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:23,920
That's fine.

3421
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,100
I did.

3422
02:08:27,620 --> 02:08:28,220
Steffi!

3423
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,120
Thank you for the gift.

3424
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,220
Did.

3425
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:31,280
Oh.

3426
02:08:37,990 --> 02:08:38,590
Oh.

3427
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:41,490
So much for our grand plan.

3428
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:42,610
Go back.

3429
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:43,390
There was more copper.

3430
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,070
I don't think we need it.

3431
02:08:49,670 --> 02:08:51,150
Let's stay in this area.

3432
02:08:51,610 --> 02:08:52,510
Very nice.

3433
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:56,270
Let's try and get some new recipes here.

3434
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:56,710
Wait.

3435
02:08:56,890 --> 02:08:57,950
I wanna test my theory.

3436
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:00,930
Oh.

3437
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:03,370
Oh, this is the resin, no?

3438
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:05,310
This is what...

3439
02:09:05,310 --> 02:09:06,210
Um...

3440
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:07,510
The new...

3441
02:09:07,910 --> 02:09:09,210
The new creepy man.

3442
02:09:09,510 --> 02:09:10,270
What's his name?

3443
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:12,830
What's that creepy guy called?

3444
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:15,550
The...

3445
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:16,890
The Reckoning.

3446
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:17,910
The...

3447
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:20,910
The Creaking.

3448
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:25,070
Let's see.

3449
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:25,610
Maybe...

3450
02:09:25,610 --> 02:09:27,470
Maybe this drops some stuff?

3451
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:30,130
It's kinda fun to see what drops...

3452
02:09:31,870 --> 02:09:33,270
Stuff and what doesn't.

3453
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:34,090
Like, what drops...

3454
02:09:35,210 --> 02:09:35,770
Uh...

3455
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:36,910
And what kind of ingredients...

3456
02:09:37,970 --> 02:09:39,210
Or seeds they drop, you know?

3457
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:44,050
It's kinda fun to figure out, like, what...

3458
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:46,350
Is going to...

3459
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:48,230
Drop something useful.

3460
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:52,270
Herobrine.

3461
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:54,930
Herobrine.

3462
02:09:57,810 --> 02:10:01,010
Also, ever since they added, like, the new bamboo wood...

3463
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:03,350
I feel like bamboo might be the best in the game.

3464
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:04,790
That's just my...

3465
02:10:04,790 --> 02:10:05,790
That's just my opinion.

3466
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:08,530
You can collect so much of it.

3467
02:10:08,690 --> 02:10:09,390
So fast.

3468
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:11,510
And make things so easy.

3469
02:10:13,590 --> 02:10:15,190
It might be the bestest.

3470
02:10:16,090 --> 02:10:17,190
The best material...

3471
02:10:18,630 --> 02:10:19,750
For wood in the game.

3472
02:10:20,670 --> 02:10:21,250
So OP.

3473
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,770
I know!

3474
02:10:22,010 --> 02:10:22,210
They...

3475
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:24,190
They really, like...

3476
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:25,630
Oh my god!

3477
02:10:25,770 --> 02:10:26,510
They're on land!

3478
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:27,930
Oh, thank goodness!

3479
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:32,210
Okay, what were some of the...

3480
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:34,130
What is that next to him?

3481
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:34,970
Is that a frog?

3482
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:36,190
Why is there a frog here?

3483
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:39,970
Best vanilla wood.

3484
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:40,870
Yeah.

3485
02:10:41,890 --> 02:10:44,970
What's some of the stuff that we could do to unlock things?

3486
02:10:45,790 --> 02:10:46,270
Uh...

3487
02:10:46,270 --> 02:10:47,130
Lurker lamb!

3488
02:10:47,710 --> 02:10:48,550
We're the...

3489
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:51,470
Thank you.

3490
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:00,690
Hope you're having a good time.

3491
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:01,910
I'm having a grand time!

3492
02:11:02,150 --> 02:11:02,630
Thank you!

3493
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:08,600
Let's just keep...

3494
02:11:09,260 --> 02:11:10,580
This is so satisfying.

3495
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:11,980
Oh my god, it sounds amazing.

3496
02:11:30,430 --> 02:11:31,350
I guess not.

3497
02:11:31,590 --> 02:11:32,130
I guess nothing.

3498
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:33,150
I feel...

3499
02:11:33,150 --> 02:11:33,810
Oh my goodness.

3500
02:11:34,190 --> 02:11:36,410
I feel like something would have spawned by now otherwise.

3501
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:38,790
Are you gonna sniff for us?

3502
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:42,730
Wait, what's that?

3503
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:44,250
Oh, he got...

3504
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:45,290
He did sniff for us!

3505
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:47,290
He gave us a seed!

3506
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:51,410
Can we see you raise a happy ghast?

3507
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:52,770
Is that update out yet?

3508
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:54,810
The ghast update.

3509
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:55,270
I...

3510
02:11:56,010 --> 02:11:58,150
I'm running out of...

3511
02:11:59,410 --> 02:12:01,050
There's like no food around here.

3512
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:02,650
How do I plant this thing?

3513
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:05,930
Torch flower seed.

3514
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:06,530
Plant.

3515
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:12,350
It's in testing.

3516
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:14,090
So if I did like the...

3517
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:14,390
What's it?

3518
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:16,570
Beta mode.

3519
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,540
There's no food around...

3520
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:25,760
Oh, there's a skelly in the tree.

3521
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:26,680
Wait, where'd he go?

3522
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:27,340
There he is.

3523
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:34,100
I don't really want to deal with skellies, so maybe...

3524
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:36,280
We just leave this world.

3525
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:43,280
Thanks for tweeting about that Metal Gear concert.

3526
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:44,540
Oh, did I?

3527
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:47,300
Got a ticket.

3528
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:48,380
Oh, have fun!

3529
02:12:51,980 --> 02:12:53,240
I don't think I tweeted about it.

3530
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:56,020
But...

3531
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:56,840
Maybe...

3532
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:59,680
I think I liked the tweet and it might have shown up in your...

3533
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:00,040
Thing.

3534
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:06,590
That happens.

3535
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:08,010
Well, let's take this too.

3536
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:09,290
Wait, do you think this will break it?

3537
02:13:09,450 --> 02:13:10,210
Wait, what is this?

3538
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:13,690
No, no, no.

3539
02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:14,690
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3540
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:16,730
Ouch!

3541
02:13:17,070 --> 02:13:17,370
No!

3542
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:18,210
No!

3543
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:19,030
No!

3544
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:43,620
Oh, gee, the drama.

3545
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:45,180
That was so...

3546
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:50,620
I should have killed him so that I could get the achievement for it.

3547
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:51,380
But it's okay.

3548
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:56,580
Oh, that was so scary!

3549
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:03,240
And I was gonna drown even too!

3550
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:10,620
Small but deadly.

3551
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:11,760
Better have good aim.

3552
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:12,040
Oh!

3553
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:16,640
It's a boss mine?

3554
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:18,460
Wait, wait, wait.

3555
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:19,500
I should have upgraded.

3556
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:20,380
I'm an idiot.

3557
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:21,380
Um...

3558
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:22,000
My bad.

3559
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,360
Whoa!

3560
02:14:37,770 --> 02:14:38,610
Next wave!

3561
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:39,330
Wait.

3562
02:14:39,590 --> 02:14:40,370
What do you mean by that?

3563
02:14:40,690 --> 02:14:41,130
Oh God.

3564
02:14:43,390 --> 02:14:43,850
Ah!

3565
02:14:44,230 --> 02:14:44,810
Oh no!

3566
02:14:45,230 --> 02:14:46,090
Oh, silverfish!

3567
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:47,170
Ew!

3568
02:14:47,530 --> 02:14:48,290
Oh my God, they're everywhere.

3569
02:14:48,530 --> 02:14:49,790
Wait, do I have to kill all these things?

3570
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:52,450
I don't even have a sword!

3571
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:53,230
There's no trees!

3572
02:14:58,210 --> 02:14:59,070
Are they dying?

3573
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:02,410
I think some of them are dying in the water because it says mobs remaining.

3574
02:15:03,170 --> 02:15:03,870
Hold on.

3575
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:06,070
Oh, pig!

3576
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,180
One second, I'll come back to you.

3577
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:13,840
Oh, they're just...

3578
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:14,940
I think they're dying in the water.

3579
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:17,680
They're drowning!

3580
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:18,860
Oh, that's stupid.

3581
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:19,480
Oh yeah!

3582
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:19,900
Look at that!

3583
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:20,900
They're perishing!

3584
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:22,380
For what reason?

3585
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:24,080
I actually don't quite know.

3586
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:29,220
They're burrowing into the stove?

3587
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,100
I don't think so.

3588
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:33,280
Otherwise, they wouldn't remain.

3589
02:15:33,860 --> 02:15:35,420
Or they would still remain, no?

3590
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:37,980
Okay.

3591
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:40,100
I'll come back to you.

3592
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:43,440
Let me get my...

3593
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:45,140
Let me get my...

3594
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:46,380
Bamboo first.

3595
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:50,760
God.

3596
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:51,960
Double jump.

3597
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:53,920
Forgot I had it.

3598
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:57,800
Gotta go play D&D.

3599
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:58,680
Oh, how fun!

3600
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,060
Thanks for hanging out.

3601
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:08,480
Despite...

3602
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:11,020
Regardless, I gotta get...

3603
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:13,240
I don't know how many waves there are, so we gotta get...

3604
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:15,220
We gotta get a sword or...

3605
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:15,900
Anything.

3606
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:17,360
We gotta get anything!

3607
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:19,840
Wait, how do I make this into wood?

3608
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,120
Wait.

3609
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,120
How do I...

3610
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:29,120
I think I need an actual...

3611
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:29,660
Tree.

3612
02:16:31,220 --> 02:16:33,340
They're still around, so...

3613
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,160
We need a crafting table.

3614
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:35,580
Okay.

3615
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:37,380
We can do that.

3616
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:39,200
We can do that.

3617
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:41,120
We'll get a couple.

3618
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:44,920
We'll get a little bits of wood.

3619
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:45,280
Okay.

3620
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:45,340
Okay.

3621
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:46,260
Alright.

3622
02:16:46,380 --> 02:16:47,080
That should be good for now.

3623
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:47,480
Okay.

3624
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:48,300
Alright.

3625
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,100
Let's...

3626
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:50,540
Boom.

3627
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:51,340
Ba-da.

3628
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:52,280
Bing.

3629
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:53,220
Ba-da.

3630
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:53,640
Bam.

3631
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:56,340
And...

3632
02:16:57,020 --> 02:16:57,620
Bam.

3633
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:58,040
Boom.

3634
02:16:58,260 --> 02:16:58,460
Oh!

3635
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:58,900
Yeah!

3636
02:16:59,160 --> 02:16:59,460
Block.

3637
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:00,220
Block.

3638
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:01,840
Nice.

3639
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:03,100
Block.

3640
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,180
More block.

3641
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:06,080
More.

3642
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:07,560
Wow.

3643
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:07,900
Okay.

3644
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:10,860
Maybe you get a lot, but it doesn't give you so much.

3645
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:12,680
Okay.

3646
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:15,560
Okay.

3647
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:16,800
And...

3648
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,080
Sword.

3649
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:19,520
Yup.

3650
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:20,940
Okay.

3651
02:17:21,140 --> 02:17:21,500
Now...

3652
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,100
Now we're cooking.

3653
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:23,760
And I'll even get an axe.

3654
02:17:24,260 --> 02:17:25,560
With my axe.

3655
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:26,700
Okay.

3656
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:29,300
Eh.

3657
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:37,690
Let's just go back.

3658
02:17:37,950 --> 02:17:39,210
If we die, we die.

3659
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:40,490
Get food, too.

3660
02:17:41,210 --> 02:17:42,270
There's only chickens.

3661
02:17:43,310 --> 02:17:44,570
Please don't poison me.

3662
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:45,410
Please don't poison me.

3663
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:45,690
Please.

3664
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:46,710
Please don't poison me.

3665
02:17:47,990 --> 02:17:48,650
Oh, god.

3666
02:17:49,450 --> 02:17:50,430
I had to fight for him.

3667
02:17:52,090 --> 02:17:52,770
You know what?

3668
02:17:52,970 --> 02:17:53,450
Actually...

3669
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:54,830
Well...

3670
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:55,510
Since...

3671
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:56,930
Since these guys are not going anywhere.

3672
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:58,150
The little...

3673
02:17:58,150 --> 02:17:58,950
What's it called?

3674
02:18:00,070 --> 02:18:01,290
The little endermites?

3675
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:02,350
Or silver...

3676
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:02,850
Silverfish?

3677
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:03,310
What are they?

3678
02:18:03,710 --> 02:18:04,190
Endermites?

3679
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:06,890
I just called them the actual creature.

3680
02:18:07,390 --> 02:18:09,310
Let's get the coal and we can...

3681
02:18:10,310 --> 02:18:10,790
Um...

3682
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:12,410
Cook...

3683
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:12,850
Something.

3684
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:15,550
Oh, we can cook the food.

3685
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:16,190
That's what I was like.

3686
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:16,910
What was I gonna cook?

3687
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:17,830
I'm cooking.

3688
02:18:18,570 --> 02:18:19,070
I'm cooking.

3689
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:22,750
Endermites.

3690
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:26,510
I know silverfish because I used to get them in my home.

3691
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:29,550
Wait.

3692
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:30,010
Nope.

3693
02:18:30,770 --> 02:18:31,050
Sorry.

3694
02:18:43,530 --> 02:18:44,690
I hate silverfish.

3695
02:18:44,830 --> 02:18:44,950
I hate silverfish.

3696
02:18:44,970 --> 02:18:46,350
They're nasty creatures.

3697
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:47,870
They're gross actually.

3698
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:49,930
Okay.

3699
02:18:50,210 --> 02:18:50,550
Uh...

3700
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:50,670
You.

3701
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:53,610
And we can make a better sword too.

3702
02:18:53,770 --> 02:18:54,130
You know what?

3703
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:56,650
Okay.

3704
02:18:56,910 --> 02:18:57,150
Okay.

3705
02:18:57,150 --> 02:18:57,810
We're cooking.

3706
02:18:57,950 --> 02:18:58,150
We're cooking.

3707
02:18:58,310 --> 02:18:58,550
We're cooking.

3708
02:18:59,490 --> 02:19:00,450
We're literally...

3709
02:19:00,450 --> 02:19:01,290
Literally cooking.

3710
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:02,970
Please.

3711
02:19:03,170 --> 02:19:03,410
Please.

3712
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:04,130
Okay.

3713
02:19:04,130 --> 02:19:04,470
The other rule.

3714
02:19:09,150 --> 02:19:09,450
Okay.

3715
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:10,510
Alright.

3716
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:11,310
Alright.

3717
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:12,370
Alright.

3718
02:19:12,730 --> 02:19:13,050
Oh wait.

3719
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:13,930
I need to make a furnace.

3720
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:14,350
Okay.

3721
02:19:24,010 --> 02:19:25,690
We have to cook.

3722
02:19:26,430 --> 02:19:27,290
Oh, we're cooking.

3723
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:28,470
Oh, we're cooking.

3724
02:19:32,110 --> 02:19:32,710
Boom.

3725
02:19:33,130 --> 02:19:33,690
Boom.

3726
02:19:35,650 --> 02:19:36,250
Boom.

3727
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:36,830
Boom.

3728
02:19:38,410 --> 02:19:40,310
Can I get five big booms?

3729
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:41,050
Boom.

3730
02:19:41,350 --> 02:19:41,550
Boom.

3731
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:42,110
Boom.

3732
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:42,590
Boom.

3733
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:43,070
Boom.

3734
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:46,130
Boom.

3735
02:19:46,350 --> 02:19:46,750
Boom.

3736
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:48,390
Oh and I was gonna make a new sword.

3737
02:19:50,290 --> 02:19:50,750
Eww.

3738
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:51,510
Thank you.

3739
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:53,430
Okay.

3740
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:55,130
We'll keep the old one just in case we need it.

3741
02:19:56,470 --> 02:19:56,930
Okay.

3742
02:19:58,190 --> 02:19:59,110
We got food.

3743
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:01,270
We got blocks.

3744
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:03,630
We're good.

3745
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:04,810
Boom.

3746
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:12,450
We're wisp guys.

3747
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:14,050
Of course we watch Minto.

3748
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:19,530
L-l-l-lava.

3749
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:21,090
Ch-ch-ch-chicken.

3750
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:24,430
That's not what this is, but it's okay anyway.

3751
02:20:26,650 --> 02:20:32,630
I can't believe they put, like, one of the redstone farms in the Minecraft movie.

3752
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:38,650
It's so strange to me because it's, like, feels like such a fan-made thing, no?

3753
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:43,130
So it's, like... It's so weird to me that it's in the movie.

3754
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:49,040
All right, let's kill these guys.

3755
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:50,120
Oh, really?

3756
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:52,940
Yeah, that's what the l-l-l-lava chicken song is.

3757
02:20:57,810 --> 02:20:58,570
Come here.

3758
02:20:58,990 --> 02:20:59,850
Oh, I'm stuck.

3759
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:01,810
Ew, ew, ew.

3760
02:21:04,410 --> 02:21:05,450
Okay, and...

3761
02:21:05,450 --> 02:21:07,450
Yeah, and...

3762
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:10,070
Yeah, and...

3763
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:11,570
Yeah, okay.

3764
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:12,890
You over there.

3765
02:21:13,530 --> 02:21:14,650
Let me get my boat.

3766
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:19,610
Why didn't they call it a bam boat?

3767
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:22,870
You should...

3768
02:21:22,870 --> 02:21:23,910
You should work for Mojang.

3769
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:27,350
Come here.

3770
02:21:28,390 --> 02:21:28,830
Disgusting.

3771
02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:30,170
Nasty creature.

3772
02:21:30,510 --> 02:21:30,690
Ew!

3773
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:32,130
Oh!

3774
02:21:32,470 --> 02:21:33,210
They're buried!

3775
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:34,150
Come here.

3776
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:35,230
Come here, nasty.

3777
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:36,570
Come here, stupid.

3778
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:39,130
Oh, I'm the stupid one.

3779
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:39,730
I'm the dumb one.

3780
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:40,310
I'm just mean.

3781
02:21:42,330 --> 02:21:43,270
I'm the stupid one.

3782
02:21:43,350 --> 02:21:43,570
Come here.

3783
02:21:43,570 --> 02:21:44,430
Ouch.

3784
02:21:44,690 --> 02:21:44,850
Ouch.

3785
02:21:45,190 --> 02:21:46,290
I can't even hit you.

3786
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:49,130
Stop bobbing up and down like that.

3787
02:21:51,550 --> 02:21:52,050
Okay.

3788
02:21:52,470 --> 02:21:53,630
Oh, there's one up top there.

3789
02:21:54,810 --> 02:21:55,310
Okay.

3790
02:21:55,570 --> 02:21:56,290
How do I get to you?

3791
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:05,000
He was the chosen one.

3792
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:07,360
Hello?

3793
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:10,520
Oh, oh!

3794
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,480
That's how I get you.

3795
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:12,060
Come here.

3796
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:12,860
Come here.

3797
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:16,240
Oh, got him.

3798
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:20,300
There's another guy.

3799
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:24,280
Why...

3800
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:24,800
Ouch!

3801
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:25,520
Ouch!

3802
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:29,440
Why are some of them not lit up?

3803
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:37,000
Nasty!

3804
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:42,160
The bar is not going down, unfortunately.

3805
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:44,860
Hello?

3806
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:48,820
Oh, there's a guy over there.

3807
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:52,020
What kind of enemy is that?

3808
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,340
This is a...

3809
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:55,580
A...

3810
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:55,820
A...

3811
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:56,700
Endermite.

3812
02:22:57,220 --> 02:22:59,460
Sometimes they spawn if you use an ender pearl.

3813
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:00,540
Oh, there's more of them.

3814
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:01,340
Come here.

3815
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:06,380
Come here.

3816
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:15,210
Come here.

3817
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:15,230
Come here.

3818
02:23:17,630 --> 02:23:18,930
No, it's a silverfish.

3819
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:20,490
Wait, actually?

3820
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:23,860
Oh.

3821
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:25,120
Wait, is it actually?

3822
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:26,540
Oh, it is a silverfish.

3823
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:27,080
You're right.

3824
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:27,780
Wait.

3825
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,480
They look exactly like the endermite.

3826
02:23:31,660 --> 02:23:32,560
Next wave!

3827
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,640
Oh, gosh.

3828
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:35,460
Wait, I was right then.

3829
02:23:37,640 --> 02:23:39,120
The endermites are...

3830
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,060
They're like a different color.

3831
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:41,020
Or they're like purple, right?

3832
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:49,130
Endermites are purple.

3833
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:50,970
They make the same sound, though.

3834
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:55,270
Here I thought I was being crazy.

3835
02:23:56,890 --> 02:23:57,770
Oh, here they come.

3836
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:59,130
From the bottom of the sea.

3837
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:04,910
Oh, more endermites!

3838
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:07,190
I mean, silverfish!

3839
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:10,050
I'm getting the name wrong.

3840
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:10,090
I'm getting the name wrong.

3841
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:15,550
Yeah!

3842
02:24:16,290 --> 02:24:17,310
Die, stupid!

3843
02:24:19,550 --> 02:24:21,010
This is so...

3844
02:24:21,010 --> 02:24:21,730
Stupid.

3845
02:24:24,210 --> 02:24:25,390
They're so slow.

3846
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:28,170
I guess I could, you know...

3847
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:28,650
Help them.

3848
02:24:28,850 --> 02:24:28,950
Ow!

3849
02:24:29,170 --> 02:24:29,310
Ow!

3850
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:30,670
He took over my boat!

3851
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:31,210
Oh, God!

3852
02:24:32,070 --> 02:24:32,590
Wait!

3853
02:24:33,050 --> 02:24:33,430
Wait!

3854
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:34,430
This is piracy!

3855
02:24:35,330 --> 02:24:35,930
Wait!

3856
02:24:36,630 --> 02:24:37,230
Wait!

3857
02:24:45,470 --> 02:24:46,350
What is that?

3858
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:48,890
No!

3859
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:50,490
They're drowned even?

3860
02:24:50,770 --> 02:24:51,110
Oh, my God.

3861
02:24:51,370 --> 02:24:51,670
Oh, my God.

3862
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:52,310
Oh, my God.

3863
02:24:52,370 --> 02:24:52,890
I'm gonna die here.

3864
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:53,790
I'm gonna die here for real.

3865
02:24:56,990 --> 02:24:57,630
They're drowned!

3866
02:25:03,130 --> 02:25:06,150
They're not even normal drowned.

3867
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:06,870
They're baby drowned!

3868
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:08,210
We're so...

3869
02:25:08,210 --> 02:25:08,890
We're so...

3870
02:25:08,890 --> 02:25:09,270
We're so...

3871
02:25:09,270 --> 02:25:10,110
We're so in trouble.

3872
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:11,430
Ouch!

3873
02:25:11,650 --> 02:25:11,770
Ouch!

3874
02:25:12,070 --> 02:25:13,070
They're so strong!

3875
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:15,130
Ugh!

3876
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:23,420
Weak attack!

3877
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:24,140
Ouch!

3878
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,460
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3879
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:26,440
Got him.

3880
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:26,980
Oh!

3881
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,140
He dropped a bunch of stuff.

3882
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,180
Wait, he dropped a bunch of stuff.

3883
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:30,600
No?

3884
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:33,980
Wait, ah!

3885
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:34,660
My inventory!

3886
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:41,970
Uh...

3887
02:25:42,410 --> 02:25:42,850
Okay.

3888
02:25:43,070 --> 02:25:43,290
Alright.

3889
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:45,510
What am I keep collecting?

3890
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:46,490
Oh, trophies.

3891
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:47,810
I can't...

3892
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:49,070
I think this is a chained...

3893
02:25:49,070 --> 02:25:49,650
Metal?

3894
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:50,470
No, yeah.

3895
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:51,570
It looks like a chained metal, too.

3896
02:25:52,430 --> 02:25:53,430
Alright, let's put my boat down.

3897
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:54,230
Okay.

3898
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:55,150
Alright.

3899
02:25:55,870 --> 02:25:57,410
Anything is better than nothing, though.

3900
02:25:58,490 --> 02:25:59,470
Buy more inventory.

3901
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:00,310
You're so right.

3902
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:02,330
Where's my...

3903
02:26:02,330 --> 02:26:02,810
Let's see.

3904
02:26:02,990 --> 02:26:03,150
Okay.

3905
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:04,310
Yippee!

3906
02:26:08,010 --> 02:26:09,130
Let's double check, though.

3907
02:26:10,590 --> 02:26:11,070
Copper?

3908
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:14,390
Is that a spitter?

3909
02:26:17,690 --> 02:26:18,170
Yes.

3910
02:26:21,390 --> 02:26:22,850
Wait, where'd all the ender...

3911
02:26:22,850 --> 02:26:23,850
I mean...

3912
02:26:23,850 --> 02:26:24,410
Silverfish.

3913
02:26:29,110 --> 02:26:30,050
What is that?

3914
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:33,010
What is that?

3915
02:26:39,430 --> 02:26:40,450
Is that a drowned?

3916
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:46,170
That's a drowned.

3917
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:47,210
He's coming.

3918
02:26:47,350 --> 02:26:48,230
Oh, they're coming this way!

3919
02:26:49,210 --> 02:26:49,690
Okay.

3920
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:53,650
Oh, they're coming this way!

3921
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:54,410
Oh, they're coming this way!

3922
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:56,330
I hear him.

3923
02:26:56,490 --> 02:26:57,690
I hear him gurgling.

3924
02:26:58,310 --> 02:26:58,710
Ew!

3925
02:26:59,730 --> 02:27:01,110
He's so fast!

3926
02:27:06,690 --> 02:27:07,530
Yeah!

3927
02:27:08,450 --> 02:27:08,870
Ouch!

3928
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:09,670
Ouch!

3929
02:27:10,830 --> 02:27:11,670
Ouch!

3930
02:27:14,430 --> 02:27:15,050
Ouch!

3931
02:27:15,730 --> 02:27:17,310
Why do you have such...

3932
02:27:17,310 --> 02:27:18,530
Why are your arms so long?

3933
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:19,590
Whoa!

3934
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:20,710
Ouch!

3935
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:25,700
He's so fast!

3936
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:31,560
I hear you!

3937
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:32,500
Okay, we got one.

3938
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:33,920
Brr-brr-brr-brr-brr...

3939
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:34,740
Let's go...

3940
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:39,660
Brr-brr-brr-brr...

3941
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:41,460
How many more waves will there be?

3942
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:45,180
Lose.

3943
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:46,220
Die.

3944
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:47,580
Die already.

3945
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:49,880
Okay.

3946
02:27:50,660 --> 02:27:51,380
Get in my boat.

3947
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:53,760
Pick up our...

3948
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:54,320
Spoils...

3949
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:54,920
Of war.

3950
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:58,200
The gurgle, okay.

3951
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:03,080
I thought I heard a gurgle.

3952
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:06,820
Okay, there's more over here.

3953
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:07,720
What are we getting?

3954
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:08,780
Trophy.

3955
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:10,240
Drowned.

3956
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:11,240
Cute.

3957
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:12,020
What's this?

3958
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:12,600
No!

3959
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:13,960
No spitter!

3960
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:15,000
No!

3961
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:15,720
No!

3962
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,340
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

3963
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:22,020
I think it'll be three waves.

3964
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:22,320
Okay.

3965
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:22,480
Okay.

3966
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,220
Maybe we get the guys on land.

3967
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,600
I need some more chicken.

3968
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:34,100
I need some more chicken soon.

3969
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:40,280
Anyone on land?

3970
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:44,410
No?

3971
02:28:56,030 --> 02:28:57,190
Oh my god, skellies.

3972
02:28:57,890 --> 02:28:58,170
Okay.

3973
02:28:58,670 --> 02:28:59,250
Come this way.

3974
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:03,350
Oh my god, that guy just was like, I'm gonna take a little dip.

3975
02:29:04,390 --> 02:29:04,830
Okay.

3976
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:05,490
All right.

3977
02:29:06,550 --> 02:29:07,250
Come here!

3978
02:29:08,030 --> 02:29:08,830
Come here, you!

3979
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:13,030
Yeah!

3980
02:29:17,810 --> 02:29:18,250
Yeah!

3981
02:29:18,610 --> 02:29:18,810
Yeah!

3982
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:19,450
Yeah!

3983
02:29:21,150 --> 02:29:21,590
Yeah!

3984
02:29:22,130 --> 02:29:22,570
Yeah!

3985
02:29:22,890 --> 02:29:23,750
Yeah, nice.

3986
02:29:25,730 --> 02:29:27,490
It makes them harder for you to swarm you.

3987
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:27,950
Exactly.

3988
02:29:28,250 --> 02:29:30,010
I don't mind them actually being in the water.

3989
02:29:30,310 --> 02:29:32,290
It is a little awkward, but it's so much...

3990
02:29:32,290 --> 02:29:34,030
It's actually so much nicer...

3991
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:35,250
...than if they were on land.

3992
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:38,130
I'm not gonna lie.

3993
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:43,070
Come here, single guy.

3994
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:46,150
Come here.

3995
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:50,700
Come here.

3996
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:54,780
Nice!

3997
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:54,860
Nice!

3998
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:55,620
Okay?

3999
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:57,180
Yes!

4000
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,520
The trophies have random rarities.

4001
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:00,980
Really?

4002
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:01,580
Me?

4003
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:03,040
Shit!

4004
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,240
Are you calling...

4005
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:07,740
You're calling yourself out?

4006
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,860
I said nothing.

4007
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:11,880
I said nothing.

4008
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:13,680
Come here!

4009
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:16,880
Don't mind if...

4010
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:19,040
If you insist...

4011
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:19,400
If you insist...

4012
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:19,740
I...

4013
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:22,980
You know...

4014
02:30:22,980 --> 02:30:23,580
There's...

4015
02:30:23,580 --> 02:30:25,120
There's tons of fish in the sea.

4016
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:25,980
As you can tell...

4017
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:27,820
Little...

4018
02:30:27,820 --> 02:30:29,220
Tons of fish in the sea, huh?

4019
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:30,980
Little silver fish...

4020
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,740
I'm sure there's gold fish...

4021
02:30:34,740 --> 02:30:35,780
Uh...

4022
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:37,840
Whatever your heart desires!

4023
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:42,780
Not if you kill them all.

4024
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:45,320
I can't help my...

4025
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:46,580
Profession as...

4026
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:47,460
Serial killer.

4027
02:30:48,820 --> 02:30:50,400
Now this is a single guy.

4028
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:57,360
He might be our actual...

4029
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:57,960
Only one left.

4030
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:03,200
Next wave!

4031
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:05,400
Next wave!

4032
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:11,100
Look, there's a zombo over there.

4033
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:12,300
There's a creeper right there.

4034
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:13,560
We're so in trouble.

4035
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:15,820
Do I have to find the exit too?

4036
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:16,780
Or will it appear?

4037
02:31:20,020 --> 02:31:20,920
I wish I...

4038
02:31:20,920 --> 02:31:22,320
I wish the sun would come up.

4039
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:25,860
Why does it feel like it's taking longer than normal?

4040
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:29,040
I wish I had more chicken.

4041
02:31:29,860 --> 02:31:30,800
The exit will appear.

4042
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:31,200
Okay.

4043
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:38,420
Raise a hand if you want to get caught by me though.

4044
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:39,400
What do you mean caught?

4045
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:40,320
What am I?

4046
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:40,760
The police?

4047
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:45,260
We're gonna have them spawn in the water again.

4048
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,320
50 creeper wave.

4049
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:48,540
Don't say that.

4050
02:31:50,340 --> 02:31:51,740
Please be more...

4051
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:52,940
Silver fish.

4052
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:54,200
Thank you!

4053
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:55,320
Wait...

4054
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:56,700
Last time we got...

4055
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:57,380
Zombie.

4056
02:31:57,720 --> 02:31:58,820
We got some drowns.

4057
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:00,220
So what will it be this time?

4058
02:32:01,780 --> 02:32:02,160
Yeah!

4059
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:06,900
More drowned!

4060
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:15,340
Okay, I see three drowned.

4061
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:18,780
I guess those guys went into the stone.

4062
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:19,980
Wait, what the hell is that?

4063
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:21,540
Uh-oh.

4064
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:23,220
What was that?

4065
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,240
What was the flying one?

4066
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:28,240
What is that?

4067
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:35,110
It's...

4068
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:35,710
It's...

4069
02:32:35,710 --> 02:32:36,190
A fairy?

4070
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:49,030
I think I can get this guy without getting caught by that skelly.

4071
02:32:49,630 --> 02:32:49,790
Yeah.

4072
02:32:51,250 --> 02:32:51,950
Come here.

4073
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:54,210
A fairy.

4074
02:32:55,370 --> 02:32:56,350
Fairies aren't real.

4075
02:32:56,510 --> 02:32:56,630
Hell...

4076
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:57,350
No, they aren't.

4077
02:32:59,490 --> 02:33:00,750
Fairies are not real.

4078
02:33:00,930 --> 02:33:01,710
You're absolutely right.

4079
02:33:01,710 --> 02:33:01,790
What?

4080
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:03,930
Hey, hey, hey!

4081
02:33:04,090 --> 02:33:04,710
Get out of there!

4082
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:08,570
Wait, it's got a pitchfork.

4083
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:09,390
Whatever it is.

4084
02:33:10,050 --> 02:33:11,230
What is that?

4085
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:16,270
Alright, let's take out as many of these little guys...

4086
02:33:16,270 --> 02:33:17,310
Let's take out the...

4087
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:19,870
The less threatening things first, I suppose!

4088
02:33:20,110 --> 02:33:20,950
Oh gosh.

4089
02:33:25,010 --> 02:33:26,170
Yeah, don't be ridiculous.

4090
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:28,290
Why would fairies be real?

4091
02:33:29,710 --> 02:33:30,110
Fairies!

4092
02:33:31,570 --> 02:33:32,310
Okay, hold on.

4093
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:45,480
I don't know what this means, but I'm gonna use it.

4094
02:33:51,050 --> 02:33:51,890
Oh, it's a time.

4095
02:33:52,550 --> 02:33:52,950
Yippee!

4096
02:33:57,520 --> 02:33:59,060
Come up, little drowned, please.

4097
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:06,110
Alright, this guy's coming over to me.

4098
02:34:07,270 --> 02:34:08,490
Come on, come on.

4099
02:34:09,650 --> 02:34:10,910
Come on, come on.

4100
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:13,390
Slow and steady, I suppose, for this.

4101
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:17,390
You can unequip the armor.

4102
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:18,670
Oh, that...

4103
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:19,550
Is that what it'll do?

4104
02:34:20,710 --> 02:34:22,310
I don't think I want to do that in this.

4105
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:22,750
Oh, yep.

4106
02:34:22,930 --> 02:34:24,270
Now we can equip our own armor.

4107
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:29,730
I think.

4108
02:34:30,370 --> 02:34:35,130
No more.

4109
02:34:35,130 --> 02:34:51,230
Kill, kill this feels very stupid.

4110
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:51,370
That's good.

4111
02:34:52,350 --> 02:34:53,750
This is of my own doing, though.

4112
02:34:57,550 --> 02:34:57,990
Okay.

4113
02:34:57,990 --> 02:34:59,930
Why aren't those guys coming to get me, though?

4114
02:35:02,930 --> 02:35:03,810
The drowned.

4115
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:04,750
Oh, they're gone.

4116
02:35:06,270 --> 02:35:07,550
Well, one of them is.

4117
02:35:09,150 --> 02:35:10,270
Was it actually a drowned?

4118
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:12,130
Maybe it's a zombie in the...

4119
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:12,910
In a cave?

4120
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:14,650
Oh, what is that?

4121
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:21,210
What did I just grab?

4122
02:35:24,830 --> 02:35:26,130
Oh, zombie.

4123
02:35:29,190 --> 02:35:30,050
Love that.

4124
02:35:31,850 --> 02:35:32,550
Oh, wait.

4125
02:35:32,610 --> 02:35:33,410
Maybe he's over there.

4126
02:35:33,590 --> 02:35:33,770
Wait.

4127
02:35:34,270 --> 02:35:34,870
Come out!

4128
02:35:35,430 --> 02:35:36,310
Come on out!

4129
02:35:39,310 --> 02:35:40,190
There he comes.

4130
02:35:41,430 --> 02:35:42,250
Oh, yeah.

4131
02:35:43,050 --> 02:35:43,850
Oh, yeah.

4132
02:35:44,490 --> 02:35:45,490
Come on, zombie!

4133
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:51,000
Where'd he go?

4134
02:35:51,220 --> 02:35:51,660
There he is.

4135
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:54,820
He's shy.

4136
02:35:55,620 --> 02:35:56,220
Come on!

4137
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:56,900
Oh!

4138
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:58,700
Oh, why does he become so fast?

4139
02:35:58,960 --> 02:35:59,780
Oh, my gosh.

4140
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:03,020
Yeah.

4141
02:36:03,700 --> 02:36:04,220
Yeah.

4142
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:05,220
Die.

4143
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:06,540
I don't care if you're a child.

4144
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:08,260
Oh, ouch.

4145
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:09,980
You have such long arms!

4146
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:13,580
Okay.

4147
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:15,100
All right.

4148
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:17,440
There's an Enderman.

4149
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:17,680
Oh, man.

4150
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:29,860
This feels like...

4151
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:31,740
I should...

4152
02:36:31,740 --> 02:36:32,240
Oh, yeah.

4153
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:33,520
I forgot about the flying guys.

4154
02:36:34,060 --> 02:36:35,540
I wonder where they're at now.

4155
02:36:40,660 --> 02:36:41,220
Ouch!

4156
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:43,500
Stupid.

4157
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:44,120
Uh-oh.

4158
02:36:44,140 --> 02:36:45,160
My sword's gonna break soon.

4159
02:36:46,660 --> 02:36:47,940
Let's, um...

4160
02:36:49,660 --> 02:36:51,240
Maybe go find some more chicken.

4161
02:36:52,100 --> 02:36:53,100
Or something.

4162
02:36:53,420 --> 02:36:54,380
Let's go to the other side.

4163
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:58,060
Let's go over this way.

4164
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:01,540
Far away from where anything else was spawning.

4165
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:04,880
We'll come back.

4166
02:37:05,940 --> 02:37:06,260
Probably.

4167
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:07,320
Ah!

4168
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:08,420
That's a thing.

4169
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:10,200
That is gonna attack me.

4170
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:10,840
Wait.

4171
02:37:11,140 --> 02:37:11,480
I don't...

4172
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,180
I'm...

4173
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:12,900
I'm not ready.

4174
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:16,700
Wait.

4175
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:17,700
I just want some chicken.

4176
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:18,180
Please!

4177
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:20,840
Please!

4178
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:24,620
We're gonna go out to...

4179
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:26,660
Go on a treasure hunt for these...

4180
02:37:26,980 --> 02:37:27,900
Other mobs.

4181
02:37:28,760 --> 02:37:29,580
Hold on.

4182
02:37:30,390 --> 02:37:31,280
Anything of...

4183
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:31,920
Of...

4184
02:37:32,390 --> 02:37:33,220
Deliciousness over here?

4185
02:37:33,660 --> 02:37:34,080
Oh!

4186
02:37:34,180 --> 02:37:34,900
Something else died.

4187
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:35,720
That's great.

4188
02:37:37,080 --> 02:37:38,240
It's a vex?

4189
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:39,780
Oh...

4190
02:37:39,780 --> 02:37:40,300
Oh, wait.

4191
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:41,540
Nothing else died.

4192
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:43,240
It just, I guess, went out of range.

4193
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:44,820
Love that.

4194
02:37:49,810 --> 02:37:51,110
Can I make cookies?

4195
02:38:01,310 --> 02:38:02,410
Increased FLV.

4196
02:38:05,790 --> 02:38:07,330
I see some sheep over there.

4197
02:38:08,110 --> 02:38:08,750
Hold on.

4198
02:38:14,050 --> 02:38:15,250
Wish I could make some armor.

4199
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:19,870
What do I need?

4200
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:21,090
Oh, some wheat.

4201
02:38:24,970 --> 02:38:26,150
I don't have that.

4202
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:34,380
Hold on.

4203
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:34,860
There's sheep.

4204
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:36,960
We can at least kill that.

4205
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:39,520
Come here.

4206
02:38:39,720 --> 02:38:41,440
This is like the slowest...

4207
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:42,160
Oh, that's a cow.

4208
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:42,540
Just kidding.

4209
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:43,320
It's not a sheep at all.

4210
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:44,500
Yippee!

4211
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:46,640
Sorry.

4212
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:47,040
Sorry.

4213
02:38:47,500 --> 02:38:48,040
Thank you.

4214
02:38:48,040 --> 02:38:49,160
Okay.

4215
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:52,220
It's the slowest wave battle ever...

4216
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:53,300
You'll ever experience.

4217
02:38:58,540 --> 02:39:01,140
I heard birds love cookies.

4218
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:03,760
You guys act like we're gonna get birds.

4219
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:06,080
You guys are fighting for my life out here.

4220
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:07,060
And you're thinking about birds?

4221
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:16,160
I'm trying to survive, and you're thinking about birds?

4222
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:20,300
Wait, I want this.

4223
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:20,980
There we go.

4224
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:26,040
Okay, let's cook up some meat real quick.

4225
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:28,680
Wait, there's another one.

4226
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:32,990
And I'm gonna mine some more...

4227
02:39:33,220 --> 02:39:34,640
Stone as well.

4228
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:38,420
Birds are surviving.

4229
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:39,680
I'm trying to survive.

4230
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:43,300
I'm trying to survive.

4231
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:46,620
This cruel world out here.

4232
02:39:47,410 --> 02:39:48,780
This is why I'm dead.

4233
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:50,980
It's too hard living.

4234
02:39:52,470 --> 02:39:55,680
This is how Kojima wanted the end fight to go.

4235
02:39:56,430 --> 02:39:57,800
I'm living out his vision.

4236
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:00,580
He really was a visionary masterpiece.

4237
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:06,500
We're genius.

4238
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:07,420
Yeah.

4239
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:08,400
It was...

4240
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,040
The end fight would be a masterpiece.

4241
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:18,280
Kojima!

4242
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:21,060
I'll...

4243
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:21,520
I'll...

4244
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:24,180
I'll do what you wanted to...

4245
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:25,260
Accomplish!

4246
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:26,780
Do these...

4247
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:27,780
Do these cost a lot?

4248
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:28,900
Or sell a lot?

4249
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:29,740
I guess...

4250
02:40:29,740 --> 02:40:30,260
Where are they?

4251
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:31,420
0.6.

4252
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:32,460
Actually, that's not so bad.

4253
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:36,340
Okay, we got five pieces...

4254
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:38,020
Of meat.

4255
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:39,880
Nice.

4256
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:43,540
This is a crazy and cool April Fools update.

4257
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:47,680
It's actually so much more expensive than I imagined it was going to be.

4258
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:48,520
So it's...

4259
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:49,880
Kind of actually insane.

4260
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,960
Like how much they actually put into this.

4261
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:55,540
You know?

4262
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:02,440
I'm gonna leave some of my things over here.

4263
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:03,400
So if we get into trouble...

4264
02:41:03,980 --> 02:41:04,640
We'll just...

4265
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:05,600
This will be our safe haven.

4266
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:07,060
I wish.

4267
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:15,590
Sword.

4268
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:17,970
Okay, get rid of you.

4269
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:19,930
Alright.

4270
02:41:19,930 --> 02:41:21,750
An outer haven.

4271
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:25,170
If you will.

4272
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:25,770
Yes.

4273
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:30,950
Actually, let's keep my sword.

4274
02:41:31,630 --> 02:41:32,270
Where'd I put it?

4275
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:34,110
Oh, there's chicken!

4276
02:41:39,990 --> 02:41:41,010
Where'd the...

4277
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:42,310
Where'd the chicken meat go?

4278
02:41:42,830 --> 02:41:43,730
Oh, there it is.

4279
02:41:44,410 --> 02:41:45,770
I don't remember killing that.

4280
02:41:45,910 --> 02:41:46,670
But I believe it.

4281
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:47,590
I believe I did that.

4282
02:41:49,150 --> 02:41:49,590
Ah!

4283
02:41:49,810 --> 02:41:50,150
Sorry.

4284
02:41:53,770 --> 02:41:54,210
Sorry.

4285
02:41:59,690 --> 02:42:00,990
I thought I was dead.

4286
02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:04,850
I thought that was it.

4287
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:06,550
I thought that was the end of my...

4288
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:08,390
End of my Minecraft life.

4289
02:42:10,150 --> 02:42:10,750
Oh wait.

4290
02:42:10,930 --> 02:42:12,250
I guess I can leave this here too.

4291
02:42:12,630 --> 02:42:13,970
Since I...

4292
02:42:13,970 --> 02:42:14,470
Yeah.

4293
02:42:14,870 --> 02:42:15,110
We'll...

4294
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:15,390
We'll...

4295
02:42:15,390 --> 02:42:16,990
We'll just have it on hand for...

4296
02:42:16,990 --> 02:42:17,970
We could kill...

4297
02:42:17,970 --> 02:42:19,610
And then get more meat and...

4298
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:20,110
Yeah.

4299
02:42:20,210 --> 02:42:20,370
Okay.

4300
02:42:20,470 --> 02:42:20,690
Cool.

4301
02:42:23,630 --> 02:42:25,710
I don't know how you guys do it.

4302
02:42:26,050 --> 02:42:26,510
Living.

4303
02:42:27,570 --> 02:42:29,150
Like knowing that...

4304
02:42:29,150 --> 02:42:31,130
Anything could come up to you and kill you.

4305
02:42:31,650 --> 02:42:32,770
You guys do that every day!

4306
02:42:33,730 --> 02:42:34,190
Wow.

4307
02:42:36,110 --> 02:42:36,630
Alright.

4308
02:42:36,750 --> 02:42:37,630
Back to the...

4309
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:38,750
Grueling...

4310
02:42:38,750 --> 02:42:39,770
Endermite...

4311
02:42:41,470 --> 02:42:41,990
Elimination...

4312
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:42,770
Um...

4313
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:43,330
Process.

4314
02:42:46,410 --> 02:42:46,950
Okay.

4315
02:42:47,530 --> 02:42:48,770
That takes care of that guy.

4316
02:42:49,270 --> 02:42:51,130
There's so many mobs remaining.

4317
02:42:51,530 --> 02:42:53,070
We're like just a little under halfway.

4318
02:42:58,440 --> 02:42:59,680
Some of them are ghosts?

4319
02:42:59,860 --> 02:43:00,280
What do you mean?

4320
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:02,040
What?

4321
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:02,920
Ghosts are gonna kill you?

4322
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:03,640
No.

4323
02:43:15,050 --> 02:43:16,870
Living can be hard.

4324
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:17,350
Yeah.

4325
02:43:21,730 --> 02:43:22,110
Okay.

4326
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:25,050
Alright.

4327
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:28,150
It's like...

4328
02:43:28,150 --> 02:43:29,270
They're like so sniffly.

4329
02:43:29,650 --> 02:43:31,410
Sounds like they're just sniffling their nose.

4330
02:43:31,870 --> 02:43:33,430
You guys got bad allergies?

4331
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:36,270
Pollen this here is quite crazy, eh?

4332
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:38,210
Sniff, sniff, sniff!

4333
02:43:39,070 --> 02:43:40,550
More sniffing than the sniffa.

4334
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:44,070
Uh oh, it's starting to get dark again.

4335
02:43:44,450 --> 02:43:45,150
Oh gosh, please.

4336
02:43:45,750 --> 02:43:46,730
Don't do this to me.

4337
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:52,290
Actually, at least we were able to make our stuff in the daytime.

4338
02:43:54,430 --> 02:43:55,390
Like our little...

4339
02:43:55,390 --> 02:43:56,310
Our little area.

4340
02:43:57,890 --> 02:43:58,450
Come here!

4341
02:44:00,870 --> 02:44:01,270
Alright.

4342
02:44:01,570 --> 02:44:02,950
Slow and steady, eh?

4343
02:44:04,610 --> 02:44:06,050
I wonder how many...

4344
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:07,410
Oh my god, there's so many over there.

4345
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:12,810
I wonder how many of the flying guys there are.

4346
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:24,130
Do you think the flying guys will be hard to beat?

4347
02:44:24,730 --> 02:44:25,670
Howdy, minto and chat.

4348
02:44:25,850 --> 02:44:26,190
Howdy.

4349
02:44:26,390 --> 02:44:29,010
I'm doing a raid, but it's like the slowest raid...

4350
02:44:29,010 --> 02:44:30,950
You'll ever experience, ever.

4351
02:44:33,470 --> 02:44:35,290
Oh, do they come up in the night?

4352
02:44:35,550 --> 02:44:36,390
Is that what it is?

4353
02:44:37,190 --> 02:44:39,410
In the daytime, they just chill down there.

4354
02:44:41,370 --> 02:44:42,530
Oh, I think they're coming.

4355
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:44,470
Oh yeah, they're coming.

4356
02:44:44,770 --> 02:44:46,530
Oh yeah, they're on their way.

4357
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:48,890
Oh yeah, they're fast.

4358
02:44:49,330 --> 02:44:50,690
Watching this on full volume...

4359
02:44:51,150 --> 02:44:53,390
Full volume...

4360
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:56,430
While Fam is sleeping next door.

4361
02:44:56,630 --> 02:44:57,250
Oh, sorry.

4362
02:44:57,650 --> 02:44:58,730
I'll try to be quiet.

4363
02:45:23,730 --> 02:45:24,730
Okay.

4364
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:25,830
Oh, nice.

4365
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:26,550
That was a good sweet.

4366
02:45:27,330 --> 02:45:28,470
Good sweet.

4367
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:37,280
Sweet.

4368
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:40,440
Hello?

4369
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:40,460
Hello?

4370
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:45,540
Everyone's telling me about Ily Joel Aspen!

4371
02:45:47,660 --> 02:45:49,160
You guys are the best.

4372
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:54,180
Might be the funniest thing ever.

4373
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:01,320
My arch nemesis...

4374
02:46:01,320 --> 02:46:02,440
Got arrested!

4375
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:02,960
Woo!

4376
02:46:05,400 --> 02:46:05,880
Okay.

4377
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:08,900
But now we wait until morning to kill...

4378
02:46:08,900 --> 02:46:09,600
These guys.

4379
02:46:09,820 --> 02:46:10,300
Unless...

4380
02:46:10,300 --> 02:46:11,680
He can come out to the ocean.

4381
02:46:14,620 --> 02:46:15,340
Cause I...

4382
02:46:15,340 --> 02:46:17,220
There's no way in hell I'm getting on land...

4383
02:46:17,220 --> 02:46:19,080
And fighting that thing...

4384
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:19,940
At night.

4385
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:21,300
Look at all those skellies!

4386
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:22,900
Look how many there are!

4387
02:46:23,340 --> 02:46:24,260
Where did he go?

4388
02:46:25,660 --> 02:46:27,380
Don't tell me they just like took off.

4389
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:30,140
You think they left?

4390
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:32,780
I have to go exploring for them!

4391
02:46:33,560 --> 02:46:33,980
Oh no.

4392
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:36,240
Don't you have wool for a bed?

4393
02:46:36,420 --> 02:46:38,680
I don't think that they'll let you make a bed.

4394
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:39,340
That's the thing.

4395
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,640
Or rather, you can make a bed.

4396
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:45,160
I don't think that you can sleep.

4397
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:47,080
Oh my god.

4398
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:49,860
This bozo over here thinks he's part of the party.

4399
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:50,580
Wait, where'd he go?

4400
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:51,240
Oh, there he is.

4401
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:53,240
He's gonna turn into a drowned!

4402
02:46:56,720 --> 02:46:59,060
Yeah, they don't really let you sleep in this mode.

4403
02:47:00,660 --> 02:47:01,140
Oh!

4404
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:01,560
Oh!

4405
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:02,480
Oh!

4406
02:47:04,220 --> 02:47:05,200
Let's go around.

4407
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:07,980
Another guy?

4408
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:10,420
I think he's not in...

4409
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:16,510
Wait, was he coming?

4410
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:18,210
Is he on his way?

4411
02:47:18,810 --> 02:47:20,130
He looks like he's getting closer.

4412
02:47:23,770 --> 02:47:25,410
They'll die of old age in a week.

4413
02:47:25,570 --> 02:47:26,790
They went for milk!

4414
02:47:28,030 --> 02:47:28,750
Oh yeah.

4415
02:47:28,770 --> 02:47:29,470
He's on his way.

4416
02:47:30,010 --> 02:47:30,650
Oh yeah.

4417
02:47:30,910 --> 02:47:31,110
Oh yeah.

4418
02:47:31,350 --> 02:47:31,870
Look at him.

4419
02:47:31,970 --> 02:47:33,790
He's flexing on us.

4420
02:47:34,090 --> 02:47:34,960
Fortnite emoting.

4421
02:47:36,710 --> 02:47:36,890
Woo!

4422
02:47:37,730 --> 02:47:38,150
12.

4423
02:47:39,490 --> 02:47:40,650
Ballerina Caputina.

4424
02:47:43,690 --> 02:47:44,430
Come here.

4425
02:47:45,370 --> 02:47:46,010
Come here.

4426
02:47:47,890 --> 02:47:48,810
Come here.

4427
02:47:50,450 --> 02:47:51,550
Come here.

4428
02:47:51,950 --> 02:47:52,630
Come here.

4429
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:53,450
Come here.

4430
02:47:53,590 --> 02:47:54,410
Come here.

4431
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:54,670
Come here ugly.

4432
02:47:55,330 --> 02:47:56,230
Stupid baby.

4433
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:57,690
Yeah, stupid baby.

4434
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:00,910
Okay.

4435
02:48:04,290 --> 02:48:06,170
Are you guys having a good week?

4436
02:48:06,930 --> 02:48:07,490
It's...

4437
02:48:07,490 --> 02:48:08,050
It's...

4438
02:48:08,050 --> 02:48:09,370
Maybe Thursday for some of you?

4439
02:48:09,570 --> 02:48:11,870
Maybe Friday for some of you?

4440
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:15,010
Having a good time?

4441
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:16,970
Water jockey.

4442
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:22,920
What did that baby do to me?

4443
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:27,360
He flexed on me and I actually really didn't appreciate it.

4444
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:30,880
I thought it was quite rude.

4445
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:34,800
Having an alright week.

4446
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:35,980
It's almost the weekend.

4447
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:42,250
Once it's the weekend, you made it!

4448
02:48:42,470 --> 02:48:43,510
You made it through the week.

4449
02:48:44,450 --> 02:48:45,910
And then next week could be good.

4450
02:48:48,430 --> 02:48:50,010
You got a new pet?

4451
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:50,610
Newt?

4452
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:51,310
Oh my god.

4453
02:48:51,550 --> 02:48:51,990
Wait.

4454
02:48:52,810 --> 02:48:53,710
There was a...

4455
02:48:53,710 --> 02:48:54,230
There was a...

4456
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:55,950
There was a lizard that I saw.

4457
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:59,270
That people were saying that they're like really great pets.

4458
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:00,650
Because they're just like...

4459
02:49:00,650 --> 02:49:01,330
Wait, wait a second.

4460
02:49:01,450 --> 02:49:02,050
Wait, hold on.

4461
02:49:02,730 --> 02:49:03,450
Oh my god.

4462
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:04,170
No way.

4463
02:49:07,130 --> 02:49:07,610
Yes!

4464
02:49:08,210 --> 02:49:08,690
Yes!

4465
02:49:08,950 --> 02:49:09,350
Sorry.

4466
02:49:09,770 --> 02:49:10,450
I was...

4467
02:49:11,290 --> 02:49:11,910
Hold on.

4468
02:49:12,010 --> 02:49:13,130
I'll explain in just a second.

4469
02:49:13,130 --> 02:49:13,970
Um...

4470
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:15,650
There was a...

4471
02:49:15,650 --> 02:49:16,750
A lizard that I saw.

4472
02:49:17,030 --> 02:49:18,790
People were saying that it's like a dog.

4473
02:49:19,230 --> 02:49:20,050
And I...

4474
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:20,590
I'm like...

4475
02:49:20,590 --> 02:49:21,050
Oh my gosh.

4476
02:49:21,370 --> 02:49:24,070
I really don't have time to care for a lizard.

4477
02:49:24,470 --> 02:49:24,990
But...

4478
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:26,590
He's just so cute!

4479
02:49:26,590 --> 02:49:27,050
Hold on.

4480
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:27,990
I saved him.

4481
02:49:28,210 --> 02:49:28,490
Where...

4482
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:29,750
I saved what he's called.

4483
02:49:30,450 --> 02:49:31,190
Hold on.

4484
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:33,090
I thought I did.

4485
02:49:35,590 --> 02:49:36,330
Oh no.

4486
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:37,390
Did it...

4487
02:49:37,390 --> 02:49:38,790
Maybe the video got deleted.

4488
02:49:39,470 --> 02:49:40,310
No way!

4489
02:49:41,470 --> 02:49:41,990
No!

4490
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:47,620
Wait.

4491
02:49:48,140 --> 02:49:49,060
Maybe it's further down.

4492
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:52,100
No!

4493
02:49:52,640 --> 02:49:53,320
Did I...

4494
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:56,060
Did I not save it for real?

4495
02:49:58,220 --> 02:49:59,380
They were like...

4496
02:49:59,740 --> 02:50:00,080
These...

4497
02:50:00,080 --> 02:50:01,880
These lizards are so cute.

4498
02:50:02,220 --> 02:50:03,080
They're like...

4499
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:03,460
Dogs.

4500
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:05,980
They're kind of like...

4501
02:50:05,980 --> 02:50:07,320
Apparently invading...

4502
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:08,160
They're kind of like...

4503
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:09,860
Invading Miami right now.

4504
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:13,400
I guess maybe someone got one as a pet.

4505
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:13,960
And then...

4506
02:50:14,680 --> 02:50:15,720
You know how it goes.

4507
02:50:15,920 --> 02:50:17,260
People get things as pets.

4508
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:18,260
And then they don't realize...

4509
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:20,240
Like the amount of work that goes into them.

4510
02:50:20,300 --> 02:50:22,860
And they just release them into the wild for some reason!

4511
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:24,720
I...

4512
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:25,140
I...

4513
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:25,540
I...

4514
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:25,640
I...

4515
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:26,600
Was it a no...

4516
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:28,240
I don't think so.

4517
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:28,520
Hold on.

4518
02:50:28,580 --> 02:50:29,000
Let me double check.

4519
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:32,420
If I see it, I'll remember.

4520
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:37,560
No...

4521
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:41,460
Hold on.

4522
02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:42,420
That actually seems right.

4523
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:44,440
Because they're big.

4524
02:50:44,840 --> 02:50:46,620
They're really big, guys.

4525
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:49,020
This might be it.

4526
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:51,060
Yes!

4527
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:51,580
Yeah!

4528
02:50:51,800 --> 02:50:52,620
The Tegu?

4529
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:53,580
Tegu?

4530
02:50:53,740 --> 02:50:54,320
Tegu?

4531
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:55,000
Tegu?

4532
02:50:55,380 --> 02:50:56,060
Tegu?

4533
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:57,320
Lizard?

4534
02:50:57,980 --> 02:50:58,480
Oh my gosh.

4535
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:00,620
Tegu?

4536
02:51:00,780 --> 02:51:01,380
That guy!

4537
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:03,620
He's so cute!

4538
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:05,340
Oh my gosh.

4539
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:07,200
They're so stinking cute.

4540
02:51:07,420 --> 02:51:07,940
Tegu.

4541
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:09,320
Tegu!

4542
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:11,300
They're so cute.

4543
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:12,020
Oh my gosh.

4544
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:13,280
I want one so bad.

4545
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:18,240
And I keep seeing videos of like...

4546
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:22,320
It'll be like my Tegu lizard wants to cuddle with the cats.

4547
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:25,600
But the cats don't want to cuddle with the Tegu lizard.

4548
02:51:26,020 --> 02:51:27,120
Oh my gosh.

4549
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:28,260
I want one.

4550
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:30,980
Oh my gosh.

4551
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:31,940
They're like puppies.

4552
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:34,080
They're so cute.

4553
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:34,980
Oh gosh.

4554
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:35,940
I want one so bad.

4555
02:51:38,140 --> 02:51:39,300
They're so cute.

4556
02:51:41,180 --> 02:51:41,740
But...

4557
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:43,440
I don't think I can care...

4558
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:45,040
I don't think I can take care of one.

4559
02:51:45,260 --> 02:51:45,820
Oh my gosh.

4560
02:51:48,360 --> 02:51:49,660
They're so cute.

4561
02:51:53,480 --> 02:51:54,600
I love lizard.

4562
02:51:56,720 --> 02:51:57,680
They're massive.

4563
02:51:57,880 --> 02:51:58,040
Yeah.

4564
02:51:58,300 --> 02:51:59,420
They're really, really big.

4565
02:51:59,620 --> 02:52:00,680
And apparently they're like...

4566
02:52:00,680 --> 02:52:03,140
Kind of an invasive species.

4567
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:05,600
And they're like kind of...

4568
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:07,020
Um...

4569
02:52:07,020 --> 02:52:07,180
Yeah.

4570
02:52:07,460 --> 02:52:09,880
Not supposed to be where they're currently at.

4571
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:10,680
But yeah.

4572
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:12,540
Uh...

4573
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:12,880
Yeah.

4574
02:52:13,020 --> 02:52:13,700
Don't cry Minto.

4575
02:52:13,940 --> 02:52:14,100
Sorry.

4576
02:52:14,240 --> 02:52:15,600
I think about lizard and I cry.

4577
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:20,680
Scaly puppies.

4578
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:21,960
I want one so bad.

4579
02:52:23,700 --> 02:52:25,340
Maybe if I didn't have cats.

4580
02:52:25,580 --> 02:52:27,160
Cause I don't think my cats would...

4581
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:28,580
Maybe they would warm up to it.

4582
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:29,200
I don't know.

4583
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:33,500
Cats and dogs are also invasive species.

4584
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:33,940
Oh my god.

4585
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:35,500
Cats are extremely invasive.

4586
02:52:36,580 --> 02:52:36,880
Oh my god.

4587
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:38,080
Cats are very invasive.

4588
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:41,900
They'll wipe out a whole population.

4589
02:52:47,300 --> 02:52:48,980
If you don't release them, it shouldn't matter.

4590
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:50,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4591
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:53,780
It's so sad when people do that with their pets.

4592
02:52:54,400 --> 02:52:55,540
Makes me so sad.

4593
02:52:57,220 --> 02:52:57,620
Okay.

4594
02:52:59,260 --> 02:52:59,660
Alright.

4595
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:01,080
It's date time, baby.

4596
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:02,300
Alright, we're back in business.

4597
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:04,660
Sorry for the...

4598
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:06,740
We...

4599
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:07,800
We took a little break.

4600
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:12,200
Now we're off to go find these other things that need to be killed.

4601
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:17,020
Okay.

4602
02:53:18,200 --> 02:53:18,900
Land!

4603
02:53:29,820 --> 02:53:33,640
I hate how smart skellies are in this game.

4604
02:53:39,010 --> 02:53:39,730
Okay.

4605
02:53:39,850 --> 02:53:40,630
Maybe not land.

4606
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:46,980
Sorry.

4607
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:48,400
Okay.

4608
02:53:48,980 --> 02:53:50,020
Everything's fine.

4609
02:53:53,720 --> 02:53:55,080
He was so fast.

4610
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:56,480
Oh my gosh.

4611
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:57,420
Iron!

4612
02:53:57,960 --> 02:53:58,480
What?

4613
02:53:59,100 --> 02:53:59,620
What?

4614
02:54:00,220 --> 02:54:01,120
This might be huge.

4615
02:54:01,760 --> 02:54:03,300
This might be...

4616
02:54:03,980 --> 02:54:04,460
Big...

4617
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:05,620
Big update.

4618
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:07,120
A big update.

4619
02:54:11,190 --> 02:54:12,670
Is there only one?

4620
02:54:12,930 --> 02:54:13,510
Please say no.

4621
02:54:13,970 --> 02:54:14,670
Please say psych.

4622
02:54:15,270 --> 02:54:16,010
There's two.

4623
02:54:21,930 --> 02:54:23,090
Where could it have gone?

4624
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:24,590
The other mobs.

4625
02:54:24,590 --> 02:54:24,650
The other mobs.

4626
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:26,950
Look at him over there.

4627
02:54:27,210 --> 02:54:27,830
Menacingly.

4628
02:54:28,820 --> 02:54:29,850
Where could they have gone?

4629
02:54:37,160 --> 02:54:39,020
They flew off into...

4630
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:39,800
Who knows where?

4631
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:41,480
Enough for a sword.

4632
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:43,500
Sword or shield.

4633
02:54:43,940 --> 02:54:46,320
I think a shield would be more important here, no?

4634
02:54:47,780 --> 02:54:49,520
Especially against these...

4635
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:49,620
Especially against these...

4636
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:50,200
Guys?

4637
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:55,360
Let's search this area a little bit more.

4638
02:54:56,840 --> 02:54:58,580
For more coal.

4639
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:00,200
Coal!

4640
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:02,020
Coal!

4641
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:03,480
Coal.

4642
02:55:03,720 --> 02:55:04,360
Coal.

4643
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:07,980
Oh, that's a pig.

4644
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:09,420
That's a pig.

4645
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:11,000
I thought that was a...

4646
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:11,540
Sheep.

4647
02:55:11,740 --> 02:55:13,320
I can't get used to the new colors.

4648
02:55:18,360 --> 02:55:19,540
Now we'll grab some more...

4649
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:20,660
Coal.

4650
02:55:20,860 --> 02:55:21,620
I mean, not coal.

4651
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:22,220
I need iron.

4652
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:23,060
Why am I saying coal?

4653
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:24,300
I need iron.

4654
02:55:30,730 --> 02:55:33,250
I need iron.

4655
02:55:34,410 --> 02:55:35,010
Okay.

4656
02:55:35,710 --> 02:55:36,310
Iron!

4657
02:55:37,410 --> 02:55:39,030
A wisp pet review.

4658
02:55:39,910 --> 02:55:41,010
The moment you are...

4659
02:55:41,010 --> 02:55:41,210
Oh, wait.

4660
02:55:41,330 --> 02:55:46,690
That one moment of you crying over a cute bird shortly after return is my go-to clip whenever I'm down.

4661
02:55:47,810 --> 02:55:49,350
Are my tears...

4662
02:55:49,350 --> 02:55:51,350
Are my tears enjoyment for you?

4663
02:55:51,730 --> 02:55:52,250
Tovek!

4664
02:55:53,790 --> 02:55:54,510
Ouch!

4665
02:55:54,850 --> 02:55:55,590
Oh my god!

4666
02:55:55,790 --> 02:55:56,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4667
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:07,740
This is all...

4668
02:56:08,580 --> 02:56:09,160
Gravel.

4669
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:14,460
Double jump is double scary.

4670
02:56:15,800 --> 02:56:19,500
With great power comes great responsibility, I guess.

4671
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:24,160
It's all gravel!

4672
02:56:27,810 --> 02:56:29,010
I don't see anymore.

4673
02:56:29,990 --> 02:56:31,530
Not like at a quick glance.

4674
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:37,520
Are you not entertained?

4675
02:56:42,390 --> 02:56:42,870
Look!

4676
02:56:43,130 --> 02:56:43,370
Wait!

4677
02:56:43,550 --> 02:56:46,690
Oh, I think the meter is going down because we're getting out of range.

4678
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:50,870
Wait, what if it goes down all the way?

4679
02:56:50,930 --> 02:56:53,950
What if I get so out of range that it disappears?

4680
02:56:56,130 --> 02:56:58,090
I don't think that's how that works though, is it?

4681
02:56:58,710 --> 02:56:59,570
Wait, what is that?

4682
02:57:01,550 --> 02:57:02,250
No way!

4683
02:57:02,350 --> 02:57:03,830
Is that one of those like sunken...

4684
02:57:05,470 --> 02:57:06,430
Like underground...

4685
02:57:06,430 --> 02:57:07,250
Pottery...

4686
02:57:07,730 --> 02:57:07,970
Barns?

4687
02:57:13,330 --> 02:57:14,290
Pottery houses?

4688
02:57:15,570 --> 02:57:16,050
Pottery...

4689
02:57:16,050 --> 02:57:16,870
Dig site?

4690
02:57:17,410 --> 02:57:18,450
It's a submarine.

4691
02:57:19,130 --> 02:57:20,490
It looks kind of like a submarine.

4692
02:57:21,230 --> 02:57:21,950
What is that?

4693
02:57:26,570 --> 02:57:27,050
No.

4694
02:57:27,050 --> 02:57:27,110
No.

4695
02:57:27,210 --> 02:57:28,450
This is not a boat.

4696
02:57:30,790 --> 02:57:31,910
You are incorrect.

4697
02:57:32,750 --> 02:57:34,050
This is...

4698
02:57:35,910 --> 02:57:36,710
What the hell?

4699
02:57:37,290 --> 02:57:38,530
This is a structure.

4700
02:57:41,730 --> 02:57:42,190
What?

4701
02:57:42,570 --> 02:57:43,010
Oh!

4702
02:57:43,550 --> 02:57:43,890
Sussy!

4703
02:57:44,730 --> 02:57:45,650
Sussy...

4704
02:57:47,690 --> 02:57:48,610
Mysterious...

4705
02:57:50,110 --> 02:57:51,030
Gravel!

4706
02:57:53,870 --> 02:57:55,270
Okay, time to go all the way back.

4707
02:57:57,030 --> 02:57:57,950
Is that a...

4708
02:57:57,950 --> 02:57:58,870
Is that a...

4709
02:57:58,870 --> 02:57:59,410
Ruined portal?

4710
02:57:59,790 --> 02:58:01,050
Wait, can we get to the nether?

4711
02:58:04,850 --> 02:58:05,590
No, what?

4712
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:07,970
Wait, there might be some good resources in there though.

4713
02:58:10,790 --> 02:58:12,590
I'm gonna end up getting lost, I think.

4714
02:58:13,910 --> 02:58:14,890
Nether is disabled.

4715
02:58:14,890 --> 02:58:15,770
No nether.

4716
02:58:16,090 --> 02:58:16,570
Interesting.

4717
02:58:16,990 --> 02:58:17,170
Okay.

4718
02:58:20,290 --> 02:58:21,110
Good to know.

4719
02:58:22,530 --> 02:58:25,270
I don't wanna waste my food by just running around, you know?

4720
02:58:28,170 --> 02:58:29,870
That's why we cook some more.

4721
02:58:30,690 --> 02:58:31,170
Baby.

4722
02:58:31,950 --> 02:58:34,390
Let's see if there's any good supplies up in there.

4723
02:58:34,510 --> 02:58:35,770
And also, let's grab some chicken.

4724
02:58:37,430 --> 02:58:37,910
Nice.

4725
02:58:37,910 --> 02:58:38,770
Wait.

4726
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:47,160
I love...

4727
02:58:47,160 --> 02:58:49,460
I love nether portals that spawn by...

4728
02:58:49,960 --> 02:58:51,080
Jungle biomes.

4729
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:52,140
Cuz they're so neat looking.

4730
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:53,600
Oh, we did get a lodestone.

4731
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:00,380
We'll keep...

4732
02:59:00,380 --> 02:59:00,760
This.

4733
02:59:00,980 --> 02:59:01,420
I guess.

4734
02:59:02,740 --> 02:59:03,380
Okay.

4735
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:04,460
No armor.

4736
02:59:13,470 --> 02:59:15,570
But maybe the lodestone doesn't do anything here.

4737
02:59:15,730 --> 02:59:17,450
Because the exit will appear, no?

4738
02:59:17,930 --> 02:59:18,310
Wow!

4739
02:59:18,610 --> 02:59:19,030
Gosher!

4740
02:59:19,030 --> 02:59:19,930
Oh my gosh.

4741
02:59:20,010 --> 02:59:21,090
Thank you so much for the 15th.

4742
02:59:21,230 --> 02:59:21,910
Thank you!

4743
02:59:22,710 --> 02:59:23,790
Thank you, thank you.

4744
02:59:26,830 --> 02:59:27,270
Whoa!

4745
02:59:28,770 --> 02:59:31,270
Never see emerald just random.

4746
02:59:37,330 --> 02:59:38,690
We are so fast.

4747
02:59:38,910 --> 02:59:39,730
We could go faster.

4748
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:41,530
Wait.

4749
02:59:41,690 --> 02:59:43,530
Actually, I wanna upgrade the like a fish.

4750
02:59:43,870 --> 02:59:44,670
Which one was that?

4751
02:59:47,990 --> 02:59:49,270
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

4752
02:59:50,510 --> 02:59:50,930
Fish.

4753
02:59:51,170 --> 02:59:51,210
Fish.

4754
02:59:51,250 --> 02:59:52,190
A fast is a fish.

4755
02:59:52,350 --> 02:59:52,790
Let's get that.

4756
03:00:00,320 --> 03:00:01,340
The raid is over.

4757
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:02,560
Wait, did it actually...

4758
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:02,960
Did I...

4759
03:00:02,960 --> 03:00:03,480
Did I...

4760
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:04,220
Did I work?

4761
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:05,260
Did it work?

4762
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:07,540
Wait, you're right.

4763
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:08,160
It's gone.

4764
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:12,540
So weird seeing the double jump.

4765
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:12,960
I know.

4766
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:13,460
Me too.

4767
03:00:14,660 --> 03:00:15,080
Wait.

4768
03:00:19,800 --> 03:00:20,440
Wait.

4769
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,260
Oh yeah, there's the thing.

4770
03:00:26,190 --> 03:00:29,070
Mito wins by doing absolutely nothing.

4771
03:00:29,930 --> 03:00:30,650
Take more...

4772
03:00:30,650 --> 03:00:31,250
Get more jump.

4773
03:00:31,330 --> 03:00:31,630
Can I?

4774
03:00:32,110 --> 03:00:33,310
Wait, is it in the sky?

4775
03:00:33,950 --> 03:00:34,590
No.

4776
03:00:35,470 --> 03:00:36,630
Why did you...

4777
03:00:37,230 --> 03:00:37,870
No way.

4778
03:00:38,530 --> 03:00:39,590
Wait a second.

4779
03:00:42,290 --> 03:00:43,490
We take those?

4780
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:44,410
No!

4781
03:00:44,410 --> 03:00:46,310
Why is it in the sky?

4782
03:00:49,470 --> 03:00:49,930
Wait.

4783
03:00:53,390 --> 03:00:54,630
Oh, plus one jump.

4784
03:00:54,770 --> 03:00:55,890
Okay, we'll save up for 24.

4785
03:00:57,390 --> 03:00:58,510
Oh my god, it ended.

4786
03:00:59,230 --> 03:01:00,850
We did it, guys.

4787
03:01:04,330 --> 03:01:05,210
They just...

4788
03:01:05,210 --> 03:01:06,830
They really just said we give up.

4789
03:01:12,070 --> 03:01:14,290
Oh my gosh, how do I get up here?

4790
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:16,810
The game!

4791
03:01:18,430 --> 03:01:21,030
They're like, hey, if you want this exit, you work for it.

4792
03:01:21,190 --> 03:01:22,590
You have to do something, Mito.

4793
03:01:22,990 --> 03:01:24,510
You can't just do nothing.

4794
03:01:24,790 --> 03:01:26,130
And expect to...

4795
03:01:26,130 --> 03:01:27,110
Expect to win.

4796
03:01:28,630 --> 03:01:29,410
Yes, sir.

4797
03:01:31,430 --> 03:01:33,510
Hold on, let's get some dirt, maybe.

4798
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:40,440
We did it!

4799
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:42,140
Wow!

4800
03:01:42,740 --> 03:01:45,160
You think, actually, with all that I have combined...

4801
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:46,560
This and...

4802
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:47,920
This...

4803
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:49,180
You think I can even get up there?

4804
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:50,720
Maybe?

4805
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:51,600
I don't think so.

4806
03:01:51,960 --> 03:01:52,700
I think I need some dirt.

4807
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:57,340
That was quite the boss battle.

4808
03:01:57,480 --> 03:01:57,940
Oh yeah.

4809
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:01,100
You know, I...

4810
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:03,900
You know me, I'm known for...

4811
03:02:04,580 --> 03:02:06,240
I'm known for...

4812
03:02:08,060 --> 03:02:10,940
Having really epic final boss battles and...

4813
03:02:12,360 --> 03:02:13,560
Getting them done...

4814
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:13,960
Getting them done...

4815
03:02:13,960 --> 03:02:15,020
In really epic...

4816
03:02:15,620 --> 03:02:16,440
Awesome ways.

4817
03:02:18,020 --> 03:02:19,120
It's so funny...

4818
03:02:19,480 --> 03:02:20,160
Uh...

4819
03:02:21,220 --> 03:02:23,340
I have so many people...

4820
03:02:23,340 --> 03:02:24,200
Not so many...

4821
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:25,280
A few...

4822
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:27,040
A handful of comments...

4823
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:27,580
On the...

4824
03:02:27,580 --> 03:02:28,680
If you watched...

4825
03:02:28,680 --> 03:02:29,040
The...

4826
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:31,920
My last part of Devil May Cry 4...

4827
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:34,700
Of just people that are really mad about how I...

4828
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:38,080
How I beat some of the bosses...

4829
03:02:38,080 --> 03:02:39,020
How I beat some of the bosses...

4830
03:02:41,700 --> 03:02:42,580
They're just...

4831
03:02:42,580 --> 03:02:43,020
Oh, ouch.

4832
03:02:43,340 --> 03:02:44,260
They're just like...

4833
03:02:44,260 --> 03:02:45,220
This is so unfair!

4834
03:02:47,900 --> 03:02:48,880
Yeah, I have...

4835
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:49,960
I have people that are...

4836
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:50,920
Like...

4837
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:51,740
Sorry...

4838
03:02:51,740 --> 03:02:52,100
I...

4839
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:53,440
I just...

4840
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:55,020
I don't know...

4841
03:02:56,940 --> 03:02:57,760
Oh, wait!

4842
03:02:57,860 --> 03:02:58,380
That's the dirt!

4843
03:02:58,680 --> 03:02:59,800
Where did that come from?

4844
03:02:59,980 --> 03:03:00,240
Uh-oh.

4845
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:01,480
Wait, I might not have enough.

4846
03:03:01,900 --> 03:03:02,580
Oh, yes I do.

4847
03:03:09,500 --> 03:03:09,980
Oh!

4848
03:03:10,240 --> 03:03:10,540
Oops.

4849
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:14,260
I miscalculated...

4850
03:03:14,260 --> 03:03:15,120
By a bit.

4851
03:03:15,460 --> 03:03:15,900
There we go.

4852
03:03:19,780 --> 03:03:20,260
Yay!

4853
03:03:27,720 --> 03:03:28,060
Alright!

4854
03:03:29,300 --> 03:03:29,780
Um...

4855
03:03:29,780 --> 03:03:30,220
Let's leave.

4856
03:03:31,540 --> 03:03:32,020
Finally.

4857
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:37,940
Woohoo!

4858
03:03:39,900 --> 03:03:40,780
They don't...

4859
03:03:40,780 --> 03:03:41,300
Just to...

4860
03:03:41,300 --> 03:03:42,740
Just to make it clear...

4861
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:44,080
They don't...

4862
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:44,560
Uh...

4863
03:03:44,560 --> 03:03:46,260
The comments don't bother me or anything.

4864
03:03:46,420 --> 03:03:47,260
I think it's kind of fun...

4865
03:03:47,260 --> 03:03:48,190
Master key...

4866
03:03:49,140 --> 03:03:49,640
It's...

4867
03:03:49,640 --> 03:03:50,140
You know...

4868
03:03:50,660 --> 03:03:52,900
I can understand from both sides...

4869
03:03:52,900 --> 03:03:53,340
Like...

4870
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:55,360
Why it would be frustrating...

4871
03:03:55,360 --> 03:03:55,940
But...

4872
03:03:55,940 --> 03:03:57,340
I mean...

4873
03:03:57,830 --> 03:03:59,340
If the game didn't want me to play it...

4874
03:03:59,340 --> 03:03:59,540
Like...

4875
03:03:59,540 --> 03:04:00,900
Why would they allow it?

4876
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:03,700
Are you winning, Minto?

4877
03:04:04,020 --> 03:04:04,400
Somehow!

4878
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:05,560
Look at this!

4879
03:04:05,560 --> 03:04:06,300
Because we've got...

4880
03:04:06,300 --> 03:04:06,960
Seven!

4881
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:07,540
One...

4882
03:04:07,540 --> 03:04:07,980
Two...

4883
03:04:07,980 --> 03:04:09,120
Three...

4884
03:04:09,120 --> 03:04:09,960
Four...

4885
03:04:09,960 --> 03:04:10,400
Five...

4886
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:10,760
Six...

4887
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:12,040
Seven...

4888
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:13,220
What's this trophy?

4889
03:04:13,660 --> 03:04:14,380
Oops...

4890
03:04:14,380 --> 03:04:15,160
Oh, another one...

4891
03:04:15,160 --> 03:04:16,040
Wait, where did you come from?

4892
03:04:20,340 --> 03:04:21,060
Oh...

4893
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:22,720
Okay...

4894
03:04:22,720 --> 03:04:23,180
Oh...

4895
03:04:23,180 --> 03:04:24,160
Different...

4896
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:25,120
Rarity, maybe?

4897
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:25,200
Should we?

4898
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:28,100
What's the key go to?

4899
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:35,480
What's the key go to?

4900
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:35,800
Oh!

4901
03:04:44,710 --> 03:04:45,410
Oh...

4902
03:04:46,110 --> 03:04:47,410
Oh...

4903
03:04:53,870 --> 03:04:55,270
Oh...

4904
03:04:55,350 --> 03:04:56,610
Dang ...

4905
03:04:59,230 --> 03:05:01,110
Now we can add more stuff!

4906
03:05:01,750 --> 03:05:02,270
Wait...

4907
03:05:03,630 --> 03:05:06,950
I don't want to play for so much longer just because...

4908
03:05:07,630 --> 03:05:10,750
I'm going to be on Doki's channel later.

4909
03:05:11,230 --> 03:05:11,690
What's this?

4910
03:05:11,810 --> 03:05:12,270
Oh, Spitter.

4911
03:05:12,950 --> 03:05:15,450
So many years of bad luck from this one.

4912
03:05:24,710 --> 03:05:26,430
Maybe a dark forest bio.

4913
03:05:28,090 --> 03:05:29,130
And slimes.

4914
03:05:30,330 --> 03:05:30,770
And...

4915
03:05:31,570 --> 03:05:32,010
More...

4916
03:05:32,010 --> 03:05:32,210
No.

4917
03:05:33,350 --> 03:05:34,230
Ew, there's...

4918
03:05:34,230 --> 03:05:35,490
Oh, there's skellies in here?

4919
03:05:35,910 --> 03:05:37,370
Okay, we might die here, guys.

4920
03:05:37,470 --> 03:05:38,230
But that's okay if we do.

4921
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:39,230
And frogs.

4922
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:47,440
If I die here, that's okay, actually.

4923
03:05:47,940 --> 03:05:50,460
Because I want to go eat before...

4924
03:05:52,340 --> 03:05:53,220
Before next.

4925
03:05:54,020 --> 03:05:55,200
Where we at, baby?

4926
03:05:57,320 --> 03:05:58,300
This is so cool.

4927
03:05:58,480 --> 03:06:00,900
What I really wanted to look forward to...

4928
03:06:00,900 --> 03:06:02,000
Was like...

4929
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,180
You can get some really wacky...

4930
03:06:05,340 --> 03:06:05,740
Um...

4931
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:06,720
Like...

4932
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:07,740
Worlds in this.

4933
03:06:07,820 --> 03:06:09,040
If you like...

4934
03:06:09,040 --> 03:06:09,440
Get...

4935
03:06:09,440 --> 03:06:10,100
Collect enough stuff.

4936
03:06:10,240 --> 03:06:12,020
Like, you can make everything wool, apparently.

4937
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:13,740
I wanted to get the...

4938
03:06:14,220 --> 03:06:14,620
Actually...

4939
03:06:16,580 --> 03:06:18,480
Actually, we might be able to get the mushroom...

4940
03:06:18,480 --> 03:06:19,600
Mushroom one.

4941
03:06:19,820 --> 03:06:20,840
Wait, this is so messed up.

4942
03:06:20,880 --> 03:06:22,080
How am I supposed to get down from here?

4943
03:06:22,560 --> 03:06:22,960
I'm...

4944
03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:24,680
I'm 100% going to take damage.

4945
03:06:25,700 --> 03:06:26,860
This is messed up.

4946
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:28,900
Game.

4947
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:31,160
Ouch.

4948
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:32,740
Okay, well...

4949
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:36,560
I wanted the mushroom one.

4950
03:06:41,660 --> 03:06:43,620
Yeah, but you can get some really crazy ones.

4951
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:44,800
Double jump will cancel.

4952
03:06:45,020 --> 03:06:45,260
Fall down.

4953
03:06:45,520 --> 03:06:46,040
What?

4954
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:47,580
No way.

4955
03:06:49,580 --> 03:06:50,100
Ouch!

4956
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:51,760
I didn't realize that would happen.

4957
03:06:51,960 --> 03:06:52,680
Here, let's try...

4958
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:53,240
Let's test it.

4959
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:57,520
Oh...

4960
03:07:02,980 --> 03:07:03,220
Um...

4961
03:07:03,220 --> 03:07:03,660
I'm just...

4962
03:07:03,660 --> 03:07:04,620
I'm just going somewhere.

4963
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:06,540
I should probably collect...

4964
03:07:06,540 --> 03:07:07,040
Wood.

4965
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:09,000
I should probably play the game.

4966
03:07:13,590 --> 03:07:15,010
It's the most powerful tool.

4967
03:07:15,210 --> 03:07:16,170
It seriously is!

4968
03:07:16,890 --> 03:07:18,470
Wow, this is such a cool...

4969
03:07:18,470 --> 03:07:18,690
Ah!

4970
03:07:43,380 --> 03:07:45,080
The goal here is mushrooms.

4971
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:52,620
The goal here is mushrooms.

4972
03:07:58,860 --> 03:08:00,080
Let's get some mushroom.

4973
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:07,620
But yeah, I was hoping that maybe...

4974
03:08:08,120 --> 03:08:09,740
I mean, it's also the way I play.

4975
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:10,560
I'm very slow.

4976
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:11,840
You guys know this, though.

4977
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:12,560
Probably by now.

4978
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:15,800
I take everything so slowly.

4979
03:08:16,340 --> 03:08:16,820
But...

4980
03:08:18,220 --> 03:08:19,880
Maybe we can play this time...

4981
03:08:19,880 --> 03:08:20,760
Sometime again.

4982
03:08:21,060 --> 03:08:21,540
And...

4983
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:23,560
Go through some crazy...

4984
03:08:24,400 --> 03:08:24,920
Oh no!

4985
03:08:25,100 --> 03:08:25,400
Dang it!

4986
03:08:25,500 --> 03:08:26,680
Some crazy...

4987
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:28,020
Get some crazy...

4988
03:08:28,020 --> 03:08:28,400
Worlds.

4989
03:08:28,640 --> 03:08:29,600
This is very...

4990
03:08:29,600 --> 03:08:31,200
Not like what I expected, though.

4991
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:31,680
From...

4992
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:32,520
I thought...

4993
03:08:32,520 --> 03:08:34,140
I thought it would be more like...

4994
03:08:34,140 --> 03:08:35,960
I thought it would be less of a...

4995
03:08:35,960 --> 03:08:36,740
It's like a...

4996
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:37,840
It's its own game.

4997
03:08:38,500 --> 03:08:39,120
You know?

4998
03:08:39,260 --> 03:08:39,800
It's crazy.

4999
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:45,660
I want the mushroom.

5000
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:48,340
I want the mushroom biome.

5001
03:08:53,530 --> 03:08:55,550
And this was all just for April Fools.

5002
03:08:55,950 --> 03:08:56,410
I'm like...

5003
03:08:56,410 --> 03:08:57,650
This is actually so...

5004
03:08:57,650 --> 03:08:58,070
Impressive.

5005
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:59,070
Just for...

5006
03:08:59,070 --> 03:09:00,810
It's like a little stupid April Fools thing.

5007
03:09:06,060 --> 03:09:06,580
I...

5008
03:09:06,580 --> 03:09:07,320
I am...

5009
03:09:07,820 --> 03:09:08,640
I am pleased.

5010
03:09:11,440 --> 03:09:12,180
I am pleased.

5011
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:12,820
And it's free!

5012
03:09:13,220 --> 03:09:13,540
So...

5013
03:09:13,540 --> 03:09:14,740
Well, I mean as long as you have Minecraft.

5014
03:09:17,980 --> 03:09:19,660
So I think that's just a little neat.

5015
03:09:20,540 --> 03:09:21,980
I sound like I'm shilling it.

5016
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:23,180
It's like...

5017
03:09:23,180 --> 03:09:23,380
I think...

5018
03:09:23,380 --> 03:09:24,200
Fun things are fun.

5019
03:09:24,420 --> 03:09:24,520
You know?

5020
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:30,240
Fun things are fun.

5021
03:09:38,340 --> 03:09:39,740
I like the different kind of biomes...

5022
03:09:40,300 --> 03:09:41,920
Or worlds you can make in this too.

5023
03:09:42,320 --> 03:09:43,260
Cause it's very...

5024
03:09:43,260 --> 03:09:43,740
It's like...

5025
03:09:43,740 --> 03:09:44,860
It feels like it's hacked.

5026
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:46,300
Like look at all the deep slate.

5027
03:09:46,300 --> 03:09:47,560
It feels like...

5028
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:48,720
A mod for real.

5029
03:09:50,360 --> 03:09:51,960
Fun things are fun.

5030
03:09:52,180 --> 03:09:52,660
Exactly!

5031
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:56,420
So if I can show you something new and fun...

5032
03:09:56,420 --> 03:09:56,860
That's...

5033
03:09:56,860 --> 03:09:57,000
You know.

5034
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:58,980
Worth it to me baby.

5035
03:10:00,340 --> 03:10:00,820
Okay.

5036
03:10:01,100 --> 03:10:02,320
I think I will cut it here though.

5037
03:10:04,740 --> 03:10:06,120
So let me get to land.

5038
03:10:07,060 --> 03:10:08,400
Let me get to land.

5039
03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:10,880
We can check this out again sometime though.

5040
03:10:12,260 --> 03:10:13,000
For sure.

5041
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:18,940
I wonder if you can use the seeds in the normal game.

5042
03:10:19,220 --> 03:10:19,900
Oh, I don't know.

5043
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:22,720
Oh yeah.

5044
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:24,620
Let's finish up my...

5045
03:10:24,620 --> 03:10:24,880
Oh wait.

5046
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:25,920
No, I was gonna...

5047
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:26,840
I'm saving up.

5048
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:29,160
For the double jump.

5049
03:10:29,380 --> 03:10:30,200
For the triple jump?

5050
03:10:31,280 --> 03:10:32,160
I know there is...

5051
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:34,300
I did see the one that starts you with the pickaxe.

5052
03:10:34,560 --> 03:10:34,900
Wait.

5053
03:10:35,220 --> 03:10:35,740
I did?

5054
03:10:35,880 --> 03:10:36,340
I thought I did.

5055
03:10:36,500 --> 03:10:37,100
Oh, this one, right?

5056
03:10:37,380 --> 03:10:38,120
Oh, it's only two.

5057
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:40,740
Mining efficiency.

5058
03:10:42,320 --> 03:10:42,680
Okay.

5059
03:10:42,720 --> 03:10:43,600
I spent all my levels.

5060
03:10:48,060 --> 03:10:50,380
Oh, animals killed have a chance of dropping extra loot.

5061
03:10:53,400 --> 03:10:54,360
Wait, hold on.

5062
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:02,540
Check it.

5063
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:06,440
I know I need to...

5064
03:11:07,100 --> 03:11:07,880
Actually play.

5065
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:12,280
But can I get one for mining like snow?

5066
03:11:14,460 --> 03:11:16,860
Or do I need to like use a sil...

5067
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:17,080
Okay.

5068
03:11:17,260 --> 03:11:17,480
Sorry.

5069
03:11:17,920 --> 03:11:18,040
Okay.

5070
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:19,000
Okay.

5071
03:11:19,360 --> 03:11:20,800
Get me out of here.

5072
03:11:20,940 --> 03:11:21,080
Get me.

5073
03:11:21,720 --> 03:11:23,060
I need to stop playing the game.

5074
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:24,720
I can't stop playing.

5075
03:11:25,180 --> 03:11:26,960
Flint and steel.

5076
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:29,540
Chicken jockey.

5077
03:11:29,900 --> 03:11:30,000
Okay.

5078
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:30,540
Okay.

5079
03:11:31,300 --> 03:11:33,420
I got held up at work so I'm late.

5080
03:11:35,460 --> 03:11:37,320
But it's my birthday Alfredo!

5081
03:11:37,740 --> 03:11:39,480
Can I get a MGS happy birthday to celebrate?

5082
03:11:39,620 --> 03:11:40,960
Of course you can.

5083
03:11:43,400 --> 03:11:45,400
Happy birthday!

5084
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:46,780
Congratulations!

5085
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:49,500
Happy birthday!

5086
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,580
With salutations!

5087
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:53,380
Happy birthday!

5088
03:11:54,120 --> 03:11:56,520
May your sky stay blue!

5089
03:11:57,500 --> 03:12:00,580
Happy birthday to you!

5090
03:12:00,980 --> 03:12:02,700
Happy birthday Alfredo!

5091
03:12:03,820 --> 03:12:05,360
You caught me just at the end.

5092
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:06,580
Lucky, lucky.

5093
03:12:07,480 --> 03:12:08,740
Thank you guys for...

5094
03:12:09,420 --> 03:12:09,980
Minecraft!

5095
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:10,720
No!

5096
03:12:11,060 --> 03:12:11,760

5112
03:12:36,380 --> 03:12:37,600
If you wanna know where I'm gonna be...

5113
03:12:37,600 --> 03:12:38,740
Wait, did she make a waiting room yet?

5114
03:12:48,130 --> 03:12:48,530

Okay, she did.

5117
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:52,170
What did she mean, scaredy cats?

5118
03:12:54,930 --> 03:12:56,330
She don't love meeting with you!

5119
03:13:00,450 --> 03:13:00,850
